Chapter 169: Ate A Bear’s Heart And A Leopard’s Gall (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

A drop of cold sweat, mixed with blood, dripped down from Du Qiang’s glabella.

Ye Qingtang could subdue him without making any noise, and with such skills, none of the junior brothers that he brought along was her opponent.

At this point, Du Qiang’s heart was flustered as though millions of horses were galloping across.

When did the outer sect of Xuanling Sect produce such an evildoer? RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Looking at her face, she was at most fifteen. But her skills…

“Put down your weapons!” Du Qiang took a deep breath and could only comply under Ye Qingtang’s threats.

The Qinglin Sect disciples who were initially still stunned suddenly heard Du Qiang. They were shocked at first, and after hesitating for a long time, they slowly pulled a distance away from the Xuanling Sect people and threw their swords down unwillingly.

A loud clanking was heard, and all the swords dropped on the floor.

“Senior Brother Gu, please let all the senior brothers retreat over here,” Ye Qingtang said to Gu Yanqiu, who was behind her.

Gu Yanqiu suddenly returned to his senses. The shock he felt was no less than any of those felt by the Qinglin Sect people.

He previously knew that Ye Qingtang was rather skilled, but he did not expect that this little junior sister’s skills were this amazing!

When Gu Yanqiu exchanged blows with Du Qiang just now, Gu Yanqiu already had an idea of Du Qiang’s abilities, and even if Gu Yanqiu were in tip-top condition, it would still be impossible for him to win against Du Qiang within a hundred moves.

Yet, unexpectedly…

Under Ye Qingtang’s hands, Du Qiang could not even make it through two moves!

“Junior Brother Meng, you all come here first,” Gu Yanqiu knew that this was not the time to be shocked. If not for Ye Qingtang’s timely appearance, even if the nine of them did not all die in the hands of Du Qiang and the rest, they would still have lost a few people.

The Xuanling Sect disciples immediately walked and stood behind Ye Qingtang.

“You can let me off now,” Du Qiang said while putting on a composed look.

Ye Qingtang laughed as she raised another hand and slapped Du Qiang’s pale face.

“Let you off? You hit my Senior Brother Qin just now. Who should I find to settle this score then?”

Du Qiang was alarmed, and before he returned to his senses, Ye Qingtang suddenly took out a dagger hung from her waist and slit Du Qiang’s wrists, breaking his tendons in a flash!

A miserable cry escaped Du Qiang’s mouth. The extreme pain from his hands caused his legs to lose strength, and he fell on his knees with a loud wail.

That sound was so shrill, and even the Xuanling Sect disciples had goosebumps from hearing it.

More than that, an unknown fear of this little junior sister who had been very quiet throughout the journey was formed.

Qin Huan was dumbfounded as well; he did not expect that Ye Qingtang would actually seek revenge for him.

Qinglin Sect was renowned for their swordplay. Ye Qingtang broke Du Qiang’s hand tendon like that, and even if Du Qiang found a way to recover in the future, his hands would not be as nimble as before.

Those few Qinglin Sect disciples wanted to go up when they saw that Du Qiang was injured.

However, Ye Qingtang suddenly grabbed Du Qiang’s hair to make him face upwards and held the hidden blade in the other hand against Du Qiang’s neck.

“Go ahead. If you all take one step further, I will send your beloved senior brother to the netherworld,” Ye Qingtang said smilingly. A bewitching smile bloomed on her exquisite face, but it only made everyone present feel an invisible murderous atmosphere.

The Qinglin Sect disciples did not dare to move anymore.

Du Qiang was still in Ye Qingtang’s hands, and they simply did not dare to resist at all.

It should be known that Du Qiang had a rather high position in Qinglin Sect’s outer sect, and if something happened to him before their eyes, they would not be able to explain to the sect.
