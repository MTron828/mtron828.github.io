Chapter 1831: Cemetery of the True Gods (3)

The True God, who had once been so beautiful that everything else seemed to fade in comparison, had now lost all its color and stood dully in the midst of this dreadful place.

The Cursed True God had been long gone and the only thing left of it was its hatred which filled the skies. Surrounded by countless corpses, the Cursed True God looked like a demon born from the depths of hell.

As she took in her surroundings, Ye Qingtang breathed in silently. The Cursed True God in front of her looked nothing like it used to.

They would never have entered this place if not for the appearance of the Deity Ocean. Now the only way they could leave this mystic realm was to destroy the bones of the Cursed True God.

Ye Qingtang flew straight at the bones of the Cursed True God, but as she reached the wall of bones, something seemed to hit her hard and she fell from the sky.

With a crash, she landed on a pile of human skeletons.

Before she could get up, Little White Tiger fell from the sky as well.

“The power of the Curse is too strong here. There’s no way we can fly above the void.” Little White Tiger got up hastily.

A frown appeared on Ye Qingtang’s face. The three people on Little White Tiger’s back had tumbled down when it fell, but the three of them still showed no signs of waking up and only fell stiffly onto the ground.

Ye Qingtang stood up and was about to put them back on Little White Tiger’s back when a deep, low breath rumbled throughout the Cemetery of the True Gods.

“What’s that sound?” Ye Qingtang paused and swept her eyes around warily.

As her gaze landed on the Cursed True God, it’s tightly shut eyes suddenly opened.

What?! Ye Qingtang was stunned.

Almost at the same time that the Cursed True God’s eyes opened, deafening howls rang through the deathly quiet Cemetery of the True Gods.

The humans embedded in their ground with only half their bodies showing, suddenly opened their eyes, which glowed a vivid red. They opened their bloody mouths and howled endlessly.

“What’s happening? Are these people not dead?” Little White Tiger looked at the reanimated bodies under his feet as a shiver ran down its spine.

The dead people stared on and they howled like haunted ghouls. Their mudstained hands clawed upwards maniacally.

“Save me...”

“Let me die...”

“Someone, save me.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Sorrowful cries filled the Cemetery of the True Gods.

The hairs on the Little White Tiger’s back all stood on their ends as the dead people clawed upwards desperately, grabbing hold of its legs.

Caught in the middle of the bodies, Ye Qingtang was dragged to the ground by gray hands as well. These creatures were no longer humans. Their red, glowing eyes stared blankly forward as they reached out relentlessly, trying to grab hold of anything alive.

They were desperately trying to pull Ye Qingtang and Little White Tiger down with them, as if wanting them to become a part of the Cemetery of the True Gods with them.

Ye Qingtang lifted her hands and dark flames shot out.

The ashy hands retracted hastily as her flames touched them.

Taking the opportunity to free herself, Ye Qingtang extricated herself from their clutches. But before she could even catch her breath, she saw Jiang Shaobai, who had fallen off Little White Tiger’s back, being dragged into the ground by the endless sea of arms.
