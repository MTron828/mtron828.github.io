1368 An Immortal! 1

In everyone’s eyes, Ye Qingtang actually flew into the sky with nothing under her feet. Her slender body was as light as a feather as she moved in the air relaxedly.

Although Ye Qingtang put on a dignified pose, she was quietly observing everyone’s reaction.

In just a moment, everyone’s jaw dropped when they saw Ye Qingtang flying in the sky.

“Imm… Immortal…” The Emperor’s eyes widened immediately.

Given the martial level in this world, leaping onto the roofs and walking on walls were the maximum. Moreover, only supreme masters like Long Qi could achieve that state, and even ordinary mighty figures like General Qiao could only walk faster than normal people at most.

Much less flying… 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Flying in midair…

That was something that only rumored immortals could achieve!

At this instant, everyone in the palace watched with mouths agape. It was as though they saw a ghost.

Initially, Ye Qingtang was not certain if anyone could fly in this world, but she felt that their martial skills were unbearable; thus, she predicted that they could not and wanted to give it a try.

Now, it seemed that…

The people here really did not know how to fly in the air…

An evil smile flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes immediately. She suddenly raised her hand, and a streak of light flowed out of her fingertip. Taking a sharp sword out from her space ring, she slashed outside the palace forcefully.

A loud rumble erupted. Under the extensive sword aura, the entire Imperial City was divided into two.

Everyone in the palace wobbled.

The Emperor, who was still thinking of killing Ye Qingtang earlier, even fell off his throne and collapsed at Ye Qingtang’s feet.

“Greetings, Immortal! I was blind and offended you. Please forgive me!”

The Emperor initially thought that Ye Qingtang was making careless remarks, but after witnessing Ye Qingtang’s “Immortal” skills, he only had immense admiration for her.

Ye Qingtang clearly did not have anything in her hands a while ago, but she made a sword appear out of nowhere. Furthermore, that slash actually had the power to split a mountain. How could an ordinary person do this!

This time, the Emperor believed Ye Qingtang completely.

Since she could fly in the air, make something appear out of nothing, and even had the strength to topple the mountains, what else could she be if not an immortal?!

The Emperor had always respected the legendary immortals; or else, he would not be bent on seeking an immortality pill. Now that he saw a living immortal before him, how could he not be agitated!

What bullsh*t Dongfang Qing! That man was not even worthy of carrying shoes in front of the immortal!

The Dongfang family, who were initially ablaze with anger, even turned pale from horror.

They could not doubt Ye Qingtang’s identity as an immortal because of everything that they saw. At the thought that they actually wanted to kill such an immortal, they broke out in a cold sweat.

For a moment, everyone was filled with profound respect, yet they also trembled in fear. Even General Qiao kneeled on the ground with reverence to experience the grace of an immortal.

Ye Qingtang was rather amused as she looked at the royal family on the ground.

They had not seen people flying in the sky, nor did they have space rings; thus, things like sword aura were even more unbelievable.

If Ye Qingtang showed those few tricks in the Central Mainland, no one would even bat an eyelid.

But the people in this world…

What could be said about them?

The people in this world… were really gullible…

“Rise.” Ye Qingtang reorganized her feelings and put on a dignified pose.
