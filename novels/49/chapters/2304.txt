Chapter 2305: Stepping Forward To Accept The Challenge (3)

“Boss, is what they are saying true?” Qin Feng looked at Ye Qing with a frown.

Knowing that the jig was up, Ye Qingtang nodded.

Qin Feng took a deep breath. Nangong Lie and the others also looked very grim, while Mu Ziying was clenching her fists tightly.

“Yo, discovering now that you have been betrayed. So pitiful…” Those busybody bystanders commented provocatively.

“I already said it, if Qin Feng and the others knew that Ye Qing used them in a bet, they would never have come.”

“And that teacher. He’s really immoral…”

Scornful remarks poured forth from the crowd. Those words were like icy snow brushing against the faces of Qin Feng and the others, making their expressions colder by the minute.

In a rare fit of silence, Lei Yan grunted before heading straight onto the fighting platform. But before he had taken more than a few steps, Nangong Lie had dragged him down.

“Let me go first.” Nangong Lie’s usual frivolity had completely disappeared. All that remained on his face was a chilling expression.

“Don’t fight with me this time. Let me go first.” Lei Yan gritted his teeth.

“I am the Senior Brother, I should lead the way.” The usually silent Jing Ze suddenly spoke up.

The crowd, who had been waiting for Lei Yan and his gang to stomp off in a rage, was utterly dumbstruck.

What was going on?

They had been trying to push each other to go up first earlier. Why had they suddenly changed their tune?

Not only that, now they were all fighting to go up the platform first?

What was happening?

The crowd was bewildered. Things were progressing in a completely unexpected way.

Just as Lei Yan and the rest were nearly coming to blows over who got to go up first, a petite figure flew up onto the battle platform.

“Student Mu Ziying, I have come to make a challenge.” Mu Ziying’s childish voice rang out over the ears of the crowd. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Lei Yan and the rest stopped scuffling to see the white-garbed Mu Ziying already standing on the platform.

Everyone was stunned.

Now that Mu Ziying was already on the platform, they could not substitute her with another. It would be considered a forfeit.

A mocking smile flashed across Di Nuo’s eyes when he saw Mu Ziying.

“Oh? Who do you want to challenge?”

Mu Ziying glanced past Di Nuo to look at Meng Yao. As the crowd stared on, she lifted her hand and pointed at Meng Yao.

“I want to challenge her.”

Everyone was thunderstruck when Mu Ziying singled out Meng Yao.

“Has Mu Ziying gone mad? Does she want to challenge Meng Yao? Meng Yao is a Paragon Ninth Heaven level now, just one step away from the Divine Lord stage. Is Mu Ziying trying to commit suicide?”

Meng Yao didn’t expect Mu Ziying to challenge her.

It should be pointed out that with her current powers, although she was still not in the top ten, she was comfortably ranked in the top 15.

What was Mu Ziying doing? She dared to challenge her?

Di Nuo was not interested in who Mu Ziying chose to challenge. The only thing he wanted was to end this farce quickly and have Ye Qing crawl out of the Netherworld Academy.

“Meng Yao, finish this as soon as possible. Don’t delay,” Di Nuo urged Meng Yao.

“Yes,” Meng Yao replied before flying onto the fighting platform.

On the platform, two figures, one big and one small, stood facing each other.

Meng Yao looked at Mu Ziying, a cold smile playing upon the corners of her lips.

“You’re pretty lucky today. Teacher instructed me to end this quickly, so you won’t need to suffer too long.” Meng Yao shook out her wrists.

“If you need to blame someone, blame it on Ye Qing. Even though he’s a useless piece of trash himself, he is sending you all to your own death.”

Despite the provocation, Mu Ziying remained expressionless. She simply stared at Meng Yao with impassive eyes.
