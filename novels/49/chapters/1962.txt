Chapter 1963: So Filthy (2)

Ye You’s body gave an involuntary shudder the moment her spirit root broke. She quickly swallowed several elixirs and used her spirit energy to heal her wounds. As her power dropped drastically at the loss of her spirit root, she suddenly felt like she had been plunged into icy waters.

Why had the Holy Lord of Shadows said ‘so filthy’?

“Holy... Holy Lord... I did as you instructed...” Ye You panted. She wanted to see if the Holy Lord of Shadows was pleased with her sincerity.

But as Ye You looked up, all she could see were those icy-cold eyes staring out of that mask. She couldn’t help shuddering from the iciness in those eyes.

A major sense of unease rose in Ye You’s heart.

Ye Qingtang showed no emotion at all as she gazed down at the pale-faced Ye You, who was now collapsed on the floor. She suddenly spoke.

“Lady Ghost.”

Lady Ghost, who had been standing guard outside the prison, immediately came to Ye Qingtang’s side. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Lift her up.” Ye Qingtang ordered.

Without a single word, Lady Ghost went forward and lifted Ye You.

Heaving a sigh, Ye You was relieved. At least she was seeing the fruition of her scheming. But just as a sliver of joy rose in Ye You’s eyes, a cold voice plunged her right back into her pit of despair.

“Lady Ghost.”

“Yes.”

“Dig out everything she knows. Use any method necessary.” Ye Qingtang’s chilly words sent Ye You straight down into the abyss.

Ye You was thunderstruck. She could hardly believe that the Holy Lord of Shadows, who had been talking to her earlier, could change so quickly and pass down such a harsh sentence on her.

How could this be...

“Holy... Holy Lord!” Ye You spluttered in disbelief as she reached out toward Ye Qingtang. But Lady Ghost pulled her back, not giving her any chance to get close to Ye Qingtang.

“Holy Lord, what does this mean? That’s not what we agree upon earlier...”

“Oh? What did we agree on?” Ye Qingtang stared coldly at the frantic Ye You. For the first time, signs of alarm were appearing on Ye You’s scheming face.

Ye You was stunned. She was unable to see through that mask to see Ye Qingtang’s expression, and a huge wave of panic engulfed her heart.

Without giving her another glance, Ye Qingtang turned and left.

Like a madwoman desperately trying to claw back her final hope at life, Ye You wailed and harangued Ye Qingtang’s betrayal and deceit. But Lady Ghost gave her a vicious slap across the face. Without any hesitation, Lady Ghost took two metal hooks and pierced them into Ye You’s shoulder blades.

Ye You’s screams echoed throughout the entire prison.

Like Jiang Qin, Ye You was hung up in mid-air and fresh blood trickled down from her wound. Her earlier wound on her abdomen had yet to completely recover and was split open again.

“Alright, tell me everything you know now. Be a good girl and tell me. I am not as benevolent as the Holy Lord.” Lady Ghost grinned at Ye You, who was in utter agony.

It was like looking at a vomit-inducing stinking worm. Absolutely disgusting.

This girl was a despicable piece of garbage. How could she even dare to think of making a deal with the Holy Lord?

Was she worthy?

Ye Qingtang left the prison, her ears echoing with the sounds of Ye You’s shrieks. When she lowered her eyes, those red lips beneath the mask slowly curled up.
