Chapter 1911: Enemy Attack (2)

Ming Wang’s eyes landed on the effeminate-looking youth.

“Another one of you has come seeking death? Please... I have no time to waste on you guys. Get your Holy Lord to come out now so that I can get this over with.” The effeminate-looking youth showed complete disregard for Ming Wang as he pursed his lips impatiently.

“You are not fit to meet her,” Ming Wang stated coldly.

The face of the effeminate-looking youth darkened. A glint surfaced in his dark pupils.

At that moment, the youth suddenly looked past Ming Wang and toward the entrance of the Temple of Shadows, where a slender figure was standing.

A twisted smile suddenly appeared on the face of the youth.

“The Holy Lord of Shadows?”

Ming Wang was stunned by the words uttered by the effeminate-looking youth. He turned and saw that Ye Qingtang had already reached the entrance of the hall.

Ming Wang frowned.

“It’s good that you have finally appeared. I won’t waste your time either. Just hand over the item and everything will be fine.” The youth smiled at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang. “...”

What item? Where did this lunatic come from? VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

There was a crazed light in the eyes of the effeminate-looking youth and he exuded danger from every pore.

A deep unease tore at Ye Qingtang’s senses.

“How dare you!” Ming Wang’s face had turned completely dark. He suddenly raised his hand and a gigantic black dragon charged toward the effeminate-looking youth.

“I already said that I am not interested in playing with minions like you.” The expression of the youth suddenly shifted and a silver glint flashed across his eyes. He raised his palm and a lavender ball of cold fire was ignited within.

The cold flames flew toward Ming Wang’s dragon. With a thunderous boom, the icy fire sliced straight through the black dragon, splitting it in half.

“It’s him!” Something clicked in Little White Tiger’s head when it saw the youth’s attack.

Ye Qingtang was taken aback.

Before she could say anything, the icy ball of fire had broken through Ming Wang’s defenses and smashed right into his body.

In the blink of an eye, Ming Wang was engulfed in lavender light. An expression of intense agony crossed his face. The lavender light seemed to have frozen into an indestructible layer of ice with Ming Wang encased inside.

“Weakling.” The effeminate-looking youth gazed disdainfully at Ming Wang. Drawing back his five fingers slightly, countless icicles suddenly protruded out of the ice surrounding Ming Wang. The icicles pierced right through Ming Wang’s body.

Ye Qingtang was stunned.

To her knowledge, Ming Wang’s powers were extremely formidable. He had already progressed beyond the Paragon level. For Ye Qingtang, who had just attained the Paragon level today, she was not a match even for Ming Wang.

But...

Even the powerful Ming Wang was totally defenseless against the youth’s attack.

“I have seen this fellow. No... more like I have felt his presence before... at the Jiang family residence. He was the one who injured Jiang Shaobai!” Little White Tiger’s fur was already standing straight on end. That unbelievably powerful aura was very familiar.

It had already encountered it earlier in the Jiang family residence.
