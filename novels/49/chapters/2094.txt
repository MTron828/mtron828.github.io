Chapter 2095: Reincarnation (2)

Elder Bai looked at Ye Qingtang suspiciously. He signaled for Elder Hua to check. Stretching her arm out, Elder Hua held onto Ye Qingtang’s wrist.

After a while. Elder Hua’s expression turned complicated.

“Her bone age is... not more than 20 years old...” Elder Hua said.

Surprise flashed past Elder Bai’s eyes.

“Are you sure?”

Elder Hua nodded.

“Elder Hua wouldn’t be wrong about it.” Another voice was heard.

“If that’s the case, she is a strange existence. I can’t think of any other reason why there’s someone with the same appearance and bone structure as our Holy Lord, other than the possibility of a clone.”

Ye Qingtang’s identity made them rather confused. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Appearances could change, but one’s bone structure and bone age couldn’t be faked. Even twins wouldn’t have the same bone structure.

“Hold on...” Elder Hua’s tone suddenly became strange as she continued grasping Ye Qingtang’s wrist. Her brows furrowed when she somehow noticed something odd about Ye Qingtang.

“You said that you’re not older than 20?” Elder Hua stared at Ye Qingtang as she asked.

“That’s right,” Ye Qingtang replied.

“Then can you tell me why you have more than 300 years of mental energy background?” Elder Hua looked at Ye Qingtang with narrowed eyes.

Ye Qingtang was shocked.

How powerful was this Elder Hua? She could sense her mental energy just by touch?

Furthermore...

She knew it in such detail!

“What 300 years of mental energy? I don’t get what you’re saying?” Ye Qingtang was bent on feigning.

How could she dare to mention her rebirth to anyone?

“I would never be wrong about this. You have so much more mental energy than others your age. This mental energy isn’t just willpower, it feels more like a carrier. This means that you have 300 more years of memories than your peers...” Elder Hua gave Ye Qingtang a discerning look.

“Could it be possession?” Elder Bai asked.

Elder Hua shook her head. “Elder Bai, you should know my capabilities. If she possessed someone, she could never hide it from me. Her soul belongs to this body.”

“Our Holy Lord passed on back then and all of us refused to believe that with her power, she would end up like that. There’s a possibility of reincarnation with the Holy Lord’s cultivation techniques...” A cold voice suddenly spoke up.

Ye Qingtang looked over, only to see a figure gradually appear on one of the chairs along the steps.

The person sat there gracefully, with his long legs crossed. He wore a fox mask that covered half of his face and his eyes were deep in thought.

“Guardian... You’re saying that... our Holy Lord has reincarnated?” Elder Hua looked at the man wearing the fox mask.

“It’s possible.” The Guardian got up and walked over to Ye Qingtang.

“With our Holy Lord’s powers, even if she reincarnated, she wouldn’t lose all her memories. However, none of us have gone through reincarnation. It’s possible that after going through rounds of reincarnation, there would be partial memory loss.” The Guardian riveted his gaze on Ye Qingtang right after he spoke.

“Exact appearance, unique bone structure, and more than 300 years of memories...” He bent over slightly to look right at Ye Qingtang.
