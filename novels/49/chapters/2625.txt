Chapter 2626 That Unparalleled Strike (3)

Just as Ye Qingtang had said, the Calamity of Wrath was powerful enough to make them feel it. Since the Feng family home was closer to the Calamity of Wrath, they could feel its might more clearly. 1

At that moment, she looked at the void with a grave expression. Even though the Heavenly Emperor had only just withstood the eighth bolt, the ninth bolt was already hanging in the sky.

More and more martial arts practitioners back away for fear that they would be hurt.

Ye Qingtang was curious as well as to whether the Heavenly Emperor would be able to withstand the ninth bolt in this lifetime. After the ninth bolt, there was still the tenth bolt. She couldn’t begin to imagine how powerful the tenth bolt would

be.

The Heavenly Emperor floated above the void with his white hair floating all around him, his hands by his side. With the blood-colored lightning around him, he looked like an earth-shattering demon who was about to declare war on the skies. It was a sight that made people gasp with awe.

But she had to say that she was filled with respect for the Heavenly Emperor who was floating above the void. He was facing the Calamity of Wrath so calmly. How many people in this world could be like him?

But before she could think of anything more, the ninth bolt of lightning from the Calamity of Wrath formed and a great sense of oppression formed all around it. The huge shadowy figure directed the lightning toward the Heavenly Emperor.

In the next second, the only thing they could hear was the deafening noise of the thunder.

In front of their very eyes, the ninth bolt of lightning carved through the sky and slammed into the Heavenly Emperor, dyeing him in blood red. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

After a few moments, the ninth bolt disappeared.

Everyone was stunned as they looked slowly at the Heavenly Emperor.

What they saw was a trace of blood on the corner of his mouth yet he remained still. The Heavenly Tribulation around him was being slowly absorbed by him.

“The Heavenly Emperor is absorbing the power of the ninth bolt from the Calamity of Wrath!” one of the practitioners exclaimed in surprise.

“Absorbing the ninth bolt…”

Ye Qingtang seemed to be pondering something

From what she could see, the Heavenly Emperor wasn’t absorbing the Calamity of Wrath but was dissolving its power slowly with some ability of his.

“The Heavenly Emperor is exceptional.”

Ye Qingtang muttered under her breath. Another person would have been destroyed by the ninth bolt from the Calamity of Wrath.

The Heavenly Emperor was extremely intelligent to have used his own power to dissolve it. Not only that, his physical defense was already on a frightening level.

With the Heavenly Emperor dissolving the last bolt, the shadowy figure behind the thunder clouds glared at him with blood-red eyes.

The last bolt quickly formed behind the thunder clouds.

The whole sky turned blood red quickly and they could no longer tell whether it was day or night. The tenth bolt let out a terrifying noise, as though it was a mountain cracking open, and hurled quickly towards the Heavenly Emperor.

At the same moment, a light appeared in the Heavenly Emperor’s eyes and he instantly turned into a golden dragon.

The golden dragon collided with the tenth bolt from the Calamity of Wrath.
