Chapter 276: Possession (3)

The dry, savage face of the Blood Moon Sect Elder was suddenly reflected in Zhou Qu’s fearful eyes.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder placed a hand on top of Zhou Qu’s and held it tightly. Opening its mouth wide, blood fog suddenly emitted out from the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s mouth and entered Zhou Qu’s eyes, nose, mouth, and ears!

As the blood fog gradually entered Zhou Qu’s body, the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s eye lost its insidious glint, and the dried body fell on the ground with a loud sound.

While the horror on Zhou Qu’s face suddenly disappeared, the two zombies beside him released their hold on him instantly.

“Zhou Qu” frowned slightly. Looking at his hands, he took a deep breath, and the blood fog that lingered on his face was absorbed into the body. When he looked up, his eyes no longer contained despair and was replaced with a solemn expression instead. A blood crescent symbol appeared between his brows.

Ye Qingtang watched this strange scene, and after noticing that the expression in “Zhou Qu’s” eyes changed, she knew that the Zhou Qu before her was already possessed by the Blood Moon Sect Elder.

“This person’s endowment is inferior, and his body is too lousy.” Despise was written all over the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s face. Although he changed into a living and muscular body, this person’s body was exasperatingly lousy when compared to the young boy from Wind Moon Sect whom he had his eyes on previously.

“Be contented,” Ye Qingtang said while folding her arms. If Zhou Qu was not here, she really would not be able to find an unlucky person for the Blood Moon Sect Elder to possess.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder touched his face and calmed down a little after feeling that this body was, at least, much more supple than that dried corpse.

“This person is called Zhou Qu, and he’s an outer sect disciple of Xuanling Sect. He had an older brother previously, but the brother is already dead. You only need to follow me using his identity.” Ye Qingtang ordered the Blood Moon Sect Elder.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder listened obediently. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The dried corpse that had lost a soul laid on the ground silently. The Blood Moon Sect Elder looked at his previous body emotionlessly. He bent down, removed some belongings from the corpse, and took out a Revolving Soul Orb that was about the size of a palm from his cloak.

That Revolving Soul Orb looked crystal clear, but there was a clump of fog in the orb while its top and bottom ends each had a dragon claw of which the entire orb was set between.

When the Blood Moon Sect Elder saw this Revolving Soul Orb, his heart wavered. He put on a casual act and brought it to Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang looked at the object in the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s hand questioningly.

“What is this?”

The Blood Moon Sect Elder replied. “This is the Revolving Soul Orb and is one of the secret treasures of the Blood Moon Sect. It can absorb the essence in the world and transfer it for the holder to absorb. It is a weapon to raise one’s cultivation. Since there’s a contract between us, I’ll just gift this to you.”

Ye Qingtang raised a brow slightly. Was he so kind?

“How do I use this thing?” Ye Qingtang took the Revolving Soul orb over and inspected it.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder replied. “You must be at the peak of Martial Qi Level 2 to use this item.”

Ye Qingtang’s interest was initially piqued as she felt that this Revolving Soul Orb was a treasure that was hard to come by. But when she heard the words “Martial Qi Level Two,” the interest in her heart vanished completely.

Peak of Martial Qi Level Two?

What was that concept!

In terms of sects, normal outer sect disciples were at most Connate Level Nine. Only by entering the inner sect to cultivate was one able to truly be exposed to the Martial Qi realm.
