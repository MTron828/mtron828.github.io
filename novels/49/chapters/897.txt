Chapter 898 Take Advantage of Others (4)

Feng Wuya used all his strength to step on Junior Brother Luo’s fingers, and he rotated his heel

The breaking sounds of bones were heard immediately. Junior Brother Luo’s fingers were totally crushed under Feng Wuya’s foot.

“Ahhh!!” A horrifying scream exploded out of his mouth as his bones were crushed.

The Supreme Academy students’ faces turned pale upon hearing the wretched scream.

“How dare you point your sword at me! Who do you think you are!” Feng Wuya scoffed and took a step back. His eyes were filled with a cruel smile as he stared at the bloody hand that was stamped by him.

“Pull the idiot up!”

The disciples of the Divine Virtual Academy immediately pulled Junior Brother Luo up from the ground.

“Do you still want to be a hero? Look at yourself. How come you stopped attacking me now?” A merciless smile appeared on Feng Wuya’s face as Junior Brother Luo was pulled up from the ground.

Before Junior Brother Luo could say anything, Feng Wuya stabbed Junior Brother Luo’s left shoulder with the dagger in his hand.

Screams rang in the air.

However, Feng Wuya’s face was filled with a distorted and crazy smile. He slowly twisted the dagger in his hand. The blade that was in the wound grounded all the flesh.

A large amount of blood flushed out of Junior Brother’s wound.

He twitched under the intense pain that was able to tear him apart.

Feng Wuya enjoyed the pain and suffering on Junior Brother Luo’s face. He pulled out his dagger and looked at the pale students of the Supreme Academy standing not far away. His face was full of defiance and arrogance.

“So pathetic. How dare you threaten me, bastard? None of your Senior and Junior Brothers will dare to make any sound even if I tortured you to death today. Do you believe that?” Feng Wuya stared at Junior Brother Luo aggressively.

At the next second, he stabbed the dagger into Junior Brother Luo’s other shoulder. He twisted the dagger to increase the pain.

“Ahhhhhhh!”

The wretched scream pierced through everyone’s ears. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The students of the Supreme Academy were all pale as they witnessed Junior Brother Luo being tortured by Feng Wuya mercilessly.

“What a bastard!” Gu Tianhe’s eyes were red as he shouted in rage. He could not control himself and was about to kill Feng Wuya.

However, how would Li Xiu allow him to be so reckless and impulsive? He stepped forward and stopped Gu Tianhe.

“Junior Brother Gu! He’s from the ancient Feng family clan! We can’t… we can’t afford to offend him…” Li Xiu frowned and said.

Gu Tianhe clenched his fists and gritted his teeth.

Feng Wuya laughed furiously upon hearing his words. He suddenly pulled out the dagger and stabbed and sliced Junior Brother Luo’s abdomen.

Junior Brother Luo’s abdomen was sliced open, and a large amount of blood flushed out instantly. His internal organs were also dangling outside his stomach as they flowed out together with the blood.

Feng Wuya grabbed Junior Brother Luo’s hair and forced him to turn his head to look at the students of the Supreme Academy.

“Watch this for yourself clearly. People from the Supreme Academy are just a group of ants under the Ancient Feng family clan. What can they do to me even if I kill you now?”

Junior Brother Luo was twitching under the pain, and his eyes were rolled back.

Feng Wuya admired the moment before death arrived. A smile appeared by his lips as he placed the dagger on Junior Brother Luo’s neck.
