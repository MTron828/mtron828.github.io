Chapter 2403: All in One Shot (4)

Recalling how Ye Qing had been asking his team to gather flowers for a long period, now they finally understood why.

“Sleeping Flowers are extremely rare and I’ve only seen them once before in an ancient book. I’ve never seen real ones before, and to think that… there would be so many in the Wailing Well and that he could recognize them.” Qiu Ke nodded slightly and looked at Ye Qing.

The Sleeping Flowers were rare and not many people knew about them. In a previous life, people had only slowly known about the flowers after the Wailing Well had been discovered.

And Ye Qing had already known about the flowers a long time ago.

The people who were suspicious of the strange teacher quickly fell silent. After all, Qiu Ke wasn’t from the Netherworld Academy and had no reason to protect Ye Qing.

What made them even more curious now was how this young teacher from the Netherworld Academy knew about these Sleeping Flowers?

…

In the Wailing Well, Lei Yan and the rest of the team had swept up all the demons. Song Yanhan all looked in shock at the demon crystals they brought back.

Never in a million years would he have expected that Ye Qing meant what he said.

Those small, unassuming flowers actually had such a use.

He had been doubting Ye Qing’s actions from the start but now he was the one who looked pathetic. He only knew how to be strong and had not observed his surroundings within the Wailing Well for things that they could use.

Song Yanhan opened his mouth a few times as he looked at Ye Qing, words of apology at the tip of his tongue. But he couldn’t seem to voice them out.

He finally realized that the one pulling the team down wasn’t Ye Qingtang, but himself.

With Ye Qing and Yun Chen’s skills in alchemy, there was no need for him at all. He was also the lowest in martial ability and would not have been able to join this team if not for Zhu Ning.

But he…

Had never once seen the truth clearly. He had always thought that he was smarter.

The team was enjoying their success at the side and had not noticed Song Yanhan’s reactions at all.

“Boss, this is so powerful. Can’t we just wait here for more demons to come and drink and we’ll be able to win easily?” Lei Yan said with a smile. He could already smell their victory.

They had brought down tens of demons in one shot. Who else other than their team could do something like this?

Ye Qingtang looked at the gleeful Lei Yan.

“That’s a good thought, but it’s not practical.”

Lei Yan’s smile froze on his lips.

“Why?”

“Even though the effects of the Sleeping Flower are extremely strong, the duration is extremely short once it enters the water. It has probably already faded.”

“What? So fast?” Lei Yan’s face fell.

Yun Chen’s mind was working fast. “If we can find more Sleeping Flowers, can we keep using this method?” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Ye Qingtang nodded.

The youths were immediately excited again. Even if the Sleeping Flowers near them were already gone, they could look for more elsewhere.

How could they possibly not come in first place with this method?

Seeing their excitement, Ye Qingtang didn’t burst their bubble. She hadn’t seen any other Sleeping Flowers elsewhere other than beside the lake.

They could only go deeper into the Wailing Well if they wanted to find more Sleeping Flowers.
