Chapter 1607: Fight The War (1)

“Injuries are inevitable in sparring. Isn’t this what you all said?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Toby needs to go to the battlefield to kill enemies, but you injured him. Do you think everyone is as shameless as you to hide in the fortress for safety?”

They did not expect Ye Qingtang to injure Toby at all; originally, Ye Qingtang would have been the injured one. However, the scene that played out was beyond their expectations.

Seeing their own brother being injured while the parasite was still quibbling, the Kingdom Knights felt a strong sense of dissatisfaction.

Just as they decided to continue pestering Ye Qingtang over this matter, the assembly horn suddenly rang, and a group of guards hurried over to notify everyone that the King was gathering all the Kingdom Knights in the hall in preparation for war.

Since the King’s orders could not be defied, everyone immediately suppressed their anger and hurried to the main hall.

Ye Qingtang carried the little white tiger and followed as well.

“What the f*ck. I thought that I’d seen many shameless people already, but it turns out that I’m still so ignorant. How are they shameless? They’re simply barefaced and brazen. Their own man couldn’t defeat you, and they’re even blaming it on you.” The little white tiger witnessed the entire scene and was utterly shocked by the behavior of the group of Kingdom Knights.

“They are displeased with me, so whatever I do is naturally wrong.” Ye Qingtang smiled faintly. She did not put this incident to heart, and she attacked today only to let them know that she was no weak figure.

As for whether they liked her or not?

Who cares?

Dozens of Kingdom Knights within the fortress scurried to the hall where the King assembled them at.

The King’s brows were tightly locked together as he looked gravely at the sand table before him. Then, he looked at the Kingdom Knights—the elites of their Supreme League Kingdom—in the hall.

“The allied forces assembled an army of 500,000 outside our fortress. This time, the Glorious Lion Knights are the vanguard. According to the information from our scouts, there are a few black witches concealed in the Glorious Lion Knights troop. Apart from this, they also prepared twenty siege engines, and it seems that they are going to launch a fierce attack on our fortress.”

The King spoke slowly.

Silence fell over the hall in a moment.

When Ye Qingtang heard the Glorious Lion Knights and black witches, she faintly guessed why the allied forces that were gathered outside the town suddenly withdrew their troops.

She reckoned that they were urgently deployed to the front lines.

“The allied forces are fully prepared this time. I need you all to buy sufficient time, and I will not deploy many troops. Your goal is only to buy time. Understood?”

The war from the previous day had just ended, and the fortress’s internal forces had yet to completely recover. They must buy enough time and wait for reinforcements to arrive.

“Is anyone of you confident to lead the troops to an enemy retreat?” The King scanned the knights at the scene.

A few Kingdom Knights were about to reply, but Joseph suddenly shot them a look before stepping forward. “Your Majesty, I have a suitable candidate.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Who?” The King said.

“Knight Tang,” Joseph said emotionlessly, but he discreetly glanced at Ye Qingtang, who was at the back of the crowd.
