Chapter 1295: Engagement (3)

“Yes.” Ling Yan took the golden seal and kept it carefully.

When the Second Princess and the Eldest Prince saw Ling Yan take the seal, their eyes almost fell out of their heads.

Ye Qingtang sat there, watching everyone’s reaction.

One might say that from the moment Ling Yan accepted the Crown Prince’s golden seal, he became the number one target on the Second Princess’s and the Eldest Prince’s blacklist.

The two of them were definitely involved in the Fourth Prince’s death. Now, Ling Yan had become the target, bringing with it another wave of events

Ye Qingtang herself had not expected to witness the moment Ling Yan became the Crown Prince.

“Congratulations, Third Royal Brother.” The Eldest Prince suddenly suppressed his emotions and raised his cup. “Ha… I got it wrong. From now on, I must refer to you as the Crown Prince. Crown Prince, all your siblings are happy that you will share our Royal Father’s burdens in the future.”

“Eldest Royal Brother is too polite.” Ling Yan smiled. He took the cup offered by a passing servant and toasted the Eldest Prince.

“The Crown Prince has always been intelligent. Our Royal Father is a wonderful judge of character. I believe that our Eternal Dynasty will prosper from now on. Here’s to you.” The Eldest Princess arose and toasted him with a smile.

Only the Second Princess looked icy. But the Advisor secretly glanced at her, and she took a deep breath and arose, carrying a natural smile on her face.

“Congratulations, Crown Prince.”

Ling Yan did not turn down any toasts, returning every compliment.

Mo Yunxian’s face was filled with joy. She arose with a cup and slowly went over to Ling Yan.

“Elder Brother Yan, in the future, I must call you Elder Brother Crown Prince. Allow Yunxian to salute you.” Mo Yunxian looked at Ling Yan with glowing eyes.

Ling Yan nodded slightly and drained his cup.

Lady Ghost, who was sitting nearby, saw it all. She secretly glanced at Ye Qingtang from the corner of her eye and saw that she was smiling faintly. Lady Ghost arose and walked towards Ling Yan.

“We did not expect such a joyous occasion on our visit. I am Lady Ghost. May I salute the Crown Prince.”

When Mo Yunxian looked at the enchantingly beautiful Lady Ghost, a look of displeasure flashed across her eyes.

“Thank you, Guardian.” Ling Yan responded with a smile.

Lady Ghost was not shocked when Ling Yan called her “Guardian”. After all, with Ling Yan’s reputation for intelligence, it was no surprise that he knew who she was.

When Ye Qingtang, who was sitting far away saw this, she also arose with her cup. Her status was that of an elder of the Temple of Shadows. If the Guardian, Lady Ghost, had already presented her congratulations, then she too needed to make a gesture.

However, Ye Qingtang only smiled and raised her cup to Ling Yan and did not speak.

She did not need to say anything in her capacity as Holy Lord of Shadows. Even a fake elder did not need to speak. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Furthermore…

For some reason, she did not feel like talking to Ling Yan right now, so she saved herself the trouble.

Ling Yan looked at Ye Qingtang raising her cup. Amusement flashed across his eyes, and he drained his cup.

Instead, it was Mo Yunxian who was standing nearby who looked surprised when she saw Ye Qingtang’s appearance.

Mo Yunxian was proud of her beauty, and few could compare with her. She was even confident that she could rival Lady Ghost.

But the moment Ye Qingtang appeared, Mo Yunxian received a jolt.

Could anyone on earth look so beautiful?

When she saw Ye Qingtang toast Ling Yan and the hint of a smile on Ling Yan’s lips, Mo Yunxian felt as if someone had stabbed her in her heart. She suddenly grew stern and suddenly spoke to Ye Qingtang.

“Who are you? You didn’t even say a word to the Crown Prince. That’s so rude.”
