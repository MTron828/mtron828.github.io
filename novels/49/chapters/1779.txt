Chapter 1780: First Move (3)

It was a gamble with the chances of winning less than one out of a hundred thousand.

Ye Qingtang felt that these fiendish demons had all gone mad. Although she had yet to see the three major tribes make a move, Ye Qingtang could clearly feel the immense power they exuded. Moreover, they also had the upperhand in terms of numbers.

The moment the trigger was pulled, it would be total armageddon.

“Great Sage, what is this Deity Ocean?” One of the little fiendish demons tugged at the corner of Ye Qingtang’s sleeve. The little fiendish demons seldom ventured out of the camp and didn’t know much of the wide world beyond.

Ye Qingtang couldn’t help furrowing her brows slightly as she looked at the group of little fiendish demons who had been tagging along by her side daily.

All the fiendish demons from every camp would be fighting to the death for the Deity Ocean. Even these little fiendish demons would be dragged into the frenzy.

Ye Qingtang had not been at the eastern camp for long and she seldom left the campsite due to her weak powers. She spent most of her time hanging around the entrance of the cave. Perhaps because of Ye Qingtang’s gentle character, the little fiendish demons were exceptionally close to her and they trailed after her all day long.

Meanwhile, although the other adult demons scorned Ye Qingtang for her weak abilities, they would always include her share when distributing the spoils of war.

It was impossible not to grow fond of them.

Ye Qingtang could already predict how dire the consequences of the fight for the Deity Ocean would be. If possible, she didn’t want to participate in this suicidal battle. She didn’t want the eastern demons to join in either.

But...

What could she do?

Ye Qingtang’s heart sank a little as she watched the raging ambition concealed within the eastern Great General’s heart.

“Great General, the little fiendish demons look rather ill. Why don’t we send them back first?” Ye Qingtang tried to speak up.

The eastern Great General didn’t even turn his head. “No one is allowed to leave from this moment on.”

It was a command that sentenced everyone to death. It was clear that the eastern Great General was prepared to go all out for the Deity Ocean. Even the little fiendish demons would be a source of power during the great battle. Every little bit counted in the fight for the Deity Ocean.

Ye Qingtang’s heart sank further. Watching those naive little fiendish demons and then at the now-familiar faces of Ba and Hu, Ye Qingtang really didn’t want to see them sent to their deaths.

But the Great General had the final say in everything. Ye Qingtang could speak till her saliva ran dry and nothing would change.

Time passed very slowly. The three major tribes remained unmoving, and the other camps had no choice but to wait at the side. All the fiendish demons were waiting for that moment—that one moment which had been immortalized in the legends. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Time drifted on. Day turned to night, before turning to day again.

The sea of demons in the mountain valley remained exactly where they were. An unprecedented sense of peace and quiet descended over the valley.

A strong gust of wind suddenly blew by, the whistling air shattering the calm of the night.

The murky eyes of the Earth Demon Tribe’s Great General had been closed but they were now wide open. Narrowing them, he gazed up into the empty sky, a sharp glint in his pupils.

“It’s here!”

Under the howling winds and shaking earth, a great fog swirled above the heads of the three elite tribes. A bizarre ancient chanting seemed to echo down from the heavens. The chanting was faint and could barely be heard above the raging winds.

In the next second, a powerful beam of light shone down from the sky onto an empty space in mid-air. As if something was being split open, a chasm appeared right at that highlighted spot!
