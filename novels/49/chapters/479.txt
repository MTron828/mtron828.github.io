Chapter 480: Head-To-Head Battle (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Although a green spirit root was only one grade lower than a blue spirit root, there was a world of differences in this one grade.

It was known by everyone that blue spirit roots could absorb the spirit energy in the world automatically. Even more so, a cultivator did not need to intentionally cultivate and only required time to reach the frightening scale of a Yin Yang True Lord!

On the other hand, green spirit roots had higher understanding abilities and martial gifts, and they had a slightly higher chance of understanding the Paragon Skill. It was only like that…

In reality, there was almost a twisted obsession with cultivators’ spirit roots on this mainland. No one knew that spirit roots were only an aid for martial cultivation, and one could still become an unrivaled powerful figure even without a spirit root.

Just like Blood Moon Sect’s Holy Lord who was born thousands of years ago.

It was said that there was no spirit root in the body of Blood Moon Sect’s Holy Lord, but despite so, he once killed the only powerful figure with an indigo spirit root on this mainland.

Although there were also rumors that the Blood Moon Holy Lord had a violet spirit root, there was already no way of proving the authenticity of the rumors.

“Ye Qingtang, since you’re here today, you shall be buried here, and this will make it easier for me to account to the sect. How about that?” Ning Luo smiled.

Ye Qingtang’s skills were not bad, but Ning Luo was confident that he could kill her.

“If you have the ability to,” Ye Qingtang said and curled her finger towards her at Ning Luo. “Come and try.”

Ning Luo’s smile froze on his face when he saw our Ye Qingtang completely belittle him.

As a Yunxiao Sect inner sect disciple at Martial Qi Level Three, he was, however, looked down upon by a Xuanling Sect inner sect disciple today?!

“Do you really want to die?!” Ning Luo paused between his words as the murderous expression in his eyes intensified.

“That’s why I told you to come and give it a try.” Ye Qingtang sneered.

As Ye Qingtang spoke, Ning Luo had vanished from where he was standing at instantly.

In almost the blink of an eye, Ning Luo was already beside Ye Qingtang and rammed a palm towards Ye Qingtang without saying a word.

The intense aura of Martial Qi Level Three escalated to the maximum in an instant.

There was a cloud of dust as wild gusts of wind were stirred up, and crushed rocks on the ground floated in midair.

Facing Ning Luo, a powerful opponent at Martial Qi Level Three, Ye Qingtang brushed the belittling thoughts away and fought seriously.

“Die!”

Ning Luo shouted sternly and hit Ye Qingtang’s crown with his palm that was filled with a destructive force.

Ye Qingtang’s expression was cold when she noticed it, and she lifted an arm to block it.

Boom!

A loud sound rang. The edges of their clothes danced in the air as both retreated a few steps.

Shock emerged in Ning Luo’s eyes immediately as he looked at Ye Qingtang strangely.

As someone at Martial Qi Level Three, he could easily crush an ordinary Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two, but Ye Qingtang was extremely strange. The skills that she displayed were not those of an ordinary Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two.

Swoosh!

In not a while, Ning Luo returned to his senses, and Ye Qingtang’s Demonic Blood Sword had already landed.

Ye Qingtang’s swordplay technique was unconventional and had unexpected winning moves. Moreover, the sword in her hand was extremely sturdy, and the demonic air around it was frightening. Ning Luo did not dare to fight head-on and could only dodge the blade for the moment as he retreated a few steps successively. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

However, Ye Qingtang refused to yield an inch and advanced on him tightly. She slashed the air with her sword, and the demonic air invaded the air within a radius of several miles. The surrounding trees were chopped by the invisible sword aura as sawdust drifted in the sky.

At that very moment, Zhu Changge, Qin Huan, and the other Xuanling Sect disciples were completely dumbfounded as they watched Ye Qingtang.
