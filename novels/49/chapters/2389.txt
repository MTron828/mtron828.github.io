Chapter 2390: Replacement (2)

On the other hand, Yun Chen’s high ranking created a major stir and attracted quite a bit of attention.

No one had even heard of Yun Chen before, but this time, his ranking was even higher than Song Yanhan’s.

Quite a number of people wondered about the identity of Yun Chen’s teacher, and whether he was Zhu Ning’s secret disciple.

But Yun Chen remained a mystery. Due to their earlier consecutive defeats, the Netherworld Academy folks kept to themselves and it became impossible for the public to garner more information.

“Yun Chen is so formidable. His win is a major boost to us.” Lei Yan and the others patted him on the back with glee. Yun Chen’s victory gave them a chance to breathe a little easier after several days of immense pressure.

“The team competition will start soon now that the alchemy competition has ended, right?” Hang Wenwei asked.

“We should have another couple of days. It will be our turn to perform then. I must let them see that we are not useless.” Lei Yan waved his fists. Goodness knew how much ridicule he had endured over the past few days. If not for Ye Qing holding him back, he would probably have gotten into a fight with some of those other students.

Qiu Nan looked at Ye Qing. “Boss, each team should have 10 students and one teacher. With Qiu Nan’s departure, we still need one more person.”

Over the past few days, they tacitly avoided any mention of Qiu Nan. But now…

They were indeed missing one person from their team.

The team competition rules were strict. If there were not enough people on the team, they would lose the chance to participate. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Ye Qingtang was well aware of that.

Yesterday, she had especially sought out Wen Qi and he only said that he would send someone over today.

Lei Yan and the others were still peeved at Qiu Nan leaving them without a single word. But it was undeniable that he was the most suitable candidate.

This year’s competition was exceptionally intense. Most of the Netherworld Academy students who participated in the individual martial arts segment returned with multiple injuries. And they had already formed their own teams anyway. It would be difficult to find a last-minute replacement.

Just as they were discussing this, Wen Qi led someone toward them.

“Ye Qing, I have brought your new teammate.” Wen Qi was smiling but the teenager standing behind him bore a more complicated expression.

Ye Qingtang, Jing Ze and the rest turned to look.

The brats were all stunned by the sight of the teenager standing behind Wen Qi.

Even Ye Qingtang was surprised when she saw who it was.

It was no random stranger whom Wen Qi had brought. It was their “old friend”, Song Yanhan.

Song Yanhan was standing quietly behind Wen Qi, looking very awkward. He could clearly see the astonished looks on the faces of Lei Yan and the rest. If not for Wen Qi’s presence, Song Yanhan might have just turned and run off.

Since losing to Yun Chen at the Netherworld Academy selection trials and after Zhu Ning lost to Ye Qing, Song Yanhan consistently avoided Ye Qing and the others. Even when Zhu Ning brought him over to Ye Qing’s place to research elixirs together, Song Yanhan would hide in a corner and make his presence as small as possible.

No one dreamed that one day, he would be forced to join Ye Qing’s team for the team competition…

Song Yanhan just felt like crying now.

If he had known things would turn out like this, he would never have provoked Qin Feng back then!

Why did he do that?!
