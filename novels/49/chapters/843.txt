Chapter 844 Flee

“Senior, in any case, I rescued you all just now. Bringing me along to the Dragon Vein should not be overboard.” Ling Yan told Master Du with a smile.

“It seems to be reasonable…” Master Du nodded eventually.

If this man did not appear just now, the consequences would be dire. Moreover, this person’s martial skills were only at the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three, and there was no need to worry about anything.

“Let’s go.” Ye Qingtang waved and walked towards the underground lair.

A while later, Ling Yan followed Ye Qingtang into the underground lair, where the Diamond Boulder laid right ahead.

This Diamond Boulder was extremely sturdy and could even be matched with Millennium Meteoric Iron. It was a pity that it could not be a refining material like the Millennium Meteoric Iron. Otherwise, this would be shocking wealth.

A moment later, a golden flame floated in Ye Qingtang’s palm.

As the golden flame clung onto the Diamond Boulder, the Diamond Boulder gradually turned into fragments.

Several hours later, Ye Qingtang finally destroyed the entire Diamond Boulder that blocked the way.

Ahead was a narrow and pitch-dark pathway which led to the Dragon Vein.

Very quickly, a golden flame that danced around Ye Qingtang lit the place.

Ye Qingtang and the others used the light from the golden flame and walked ahead in large strides.

An hour later, a terrifying roar rang from somewhere halfway through the pathway.

For a moment, Ye Qingtang and Master Du were on the alert as they sized up the surroundings.

Even the periphery of a Dragon Vein was also extremely dangerous, and both of them were aware of this. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Sss.”

“Sssssssss.”

Unusual sounds were heard very quickly.

Master Du used the light to peer ahead.

Before long, a scarecrow that was made from straws appeared in everyone’s line of sight.

“What is that thing?” Master Du had an odd expression. Why could that scarecrow stand straight and walk like a human?!

Before Ye Qingtang could say anything, several scarecrows appeared again.

“F*ck. Get lost. Don’t block the way!” The little white tiger shouted coldly at those scarecrows.

However, as the little white tiger spoke, the roars that they heard before sounded from these scarecrows’ mouths.

In the next second, an appalling demonic air appeared on those scarecrows’ bodies.

“This is bad!”

Sensing the immense and frightening demonic air, Master Du had an expression of shock.

Not mentioning Master Du, even Ye Qingtang’s expression changed as well. Each of those scarecrows was nearly as skilled as Falling Sky Valley’s Full Moon Peak Master, Xuanyuan Yi!

In a flash, several scarecrows charged towards Ye Qingtang and Master Du.

“Run!”

Master Du yelled and ran away.

Ye Qingtang did not hesitate either and fled when those scarecrows appeared.

Only Ling Yan was held behind by the scarecrows as his martial skills were weaker.

At this instant, Ye Qingtang did not have the mind to care about Ling Yan as they were not even friends, and he even teased her a few times since appearing.

“Ah…” Blocked by two of the scarecrows, Ling Yan shook his head and sighed. “What kind of friend is this to leave me behind and flee on your own.”

Swoosh!

As he spoke, two scarecrows cried and wanted to rip Ling Yan apart.

At the same time, a black gourd appeared in Ling Yan’s hand.

All of the demonic air on those scarecrows was actually sucked away by the black gourd.

In the next second, without the demonic air, the scarecrows split into pieces.
