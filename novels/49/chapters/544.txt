Chapter 545 Blood Moon Holy Lord (1)

At that instant, the Blood Moon Elder walked out from the carriage and looked at Ye Qingtang. “Why did it become like this!”

Although he knew that Ye Qingtang could never be their Blood Moon Sect Guardian, he thought that Ye Qingtang’s identity as a Blood Moon Guardian was definitely not fake. Otherwise, she would not have passed the Demonic Water’s test.

But why did things develop to this stage?!

Almost the whole troop was deployed from the two super sects, and this Blood Moon Sect Division would definitely not be able to defeat them. He was afraid that all of them would be exterminated here today.

Ye Qingtang did not loathe Blood Moon Sect. After interacting with them for a few days, she instead felt that the members had a straightforward personality. Although their character was strange, they were no evil villains.

If this entire Blood Moon Sect Division was destructed here today…

Ye Qingtang’s brows were tightly furrowed. A sense of helplessness arose within her as she watched the Blood Moon Sect members hold up with difficulty.

She could not blame Xuanling Sect’s Grand Elder for sabotaging her as the situation happened too suddenly, and the Grand Elder was completely unaware.

It was, however, that her efforts would ultimately be wasted…

Suddenly, the Blood Moon Division Head retreated backward. His complexion was pale as he panted hurriedly. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“This malicious girl…” The Blood Moon Division Head gritted his teeth when he saw Ye Qingtang beside him.

If Ye Qingtang had not pretended to be a Blood Moon Guardian, they would not appear in Xuanling Sect and fight with three super sects before recovering their primordial qi fully.

However…

Before the Blood Moon Division Head continued to say anything, he was completely stupefied. The pair of eyes that was initially filled with fury was instead replaced by a look of disbelief as he looked behind Ye Qingtang.

A tall figure had appeared behind Ye Qingtang from some time ago. That tall and straight figure was like the pillar of this world; his symbolic silver hair tousled in the wind.

On his flawless face, the blood-colored crescent at his glabella appeared devilishly charming.

“Holy… Holy… Holy… Holy holy holy…” The Blood Moon Division Head stared at that god-like male with his mouth agape. His burly body quivered incessantly as he gulped.

The silver-haired man ignored the Blood Moon Division Head as he slowly raised his right hand and patted Ye Qingtang’s shoulder gently.

Suddenly feeling a tap on her shoulder, Ye Qingtang turned around instinctively.

But when she saw the silver-haired man behind her, she was taken aback.

“Younger brother?” Puzzlement filled Ye Qingtang eyes as she looked at the silver-haired man before her.

Wasn’t this…

The cheapskate brother she picked up on the way that day? Why did he appear here?

“Younger… Younger… Younger… Younger Brother?!”

After hearing the words “younger brother” from Ye Qingtang, it was as though the Blood Moon Division Head turned into stone.

What did… this malicious girl who pretended to be a Blood Moon Guardian… call that lordship… Younger Brother? Younger Brother?!!

“Division Head?”

Seeing that the Blood Moon Division Head had not returned to his senses after a long time, the Blood Moon Sect members and Branch Masters looked towards where Ye Qingtang was standing in puzzlement.

In just a second, everyone was stunned, and some Branch Masters even forgot to counter-attack and were forced backward by the powerful figures from the two super sects.

After taking a clear look of the silver-haired male behind Ye Qingtang, the Blood Moon Elder who had been vexed by the current situation reacted the same way as the Blood Moon Sect members. His eyes dilated, and his body almost collapsed.

That indifferent male was none other than Blood Moon Sect’s supreme faith totem… the Blood Moon Holy Lord!

The Blood Moon Holy Lord had graced them with his presence.
