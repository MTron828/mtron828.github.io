The aura of death hung constantly over the mystic realm.

Ye Qingtang could see from afar, the shining “stars” in the sky in front of her. These lights were all gathered in one spot and were shining incessantly.

A sense of foreboding rose in her throat. She quickly hugged the little white tiger and swerved toward the iceberg below her feet. She found a cave and quickly hid inside.

But in the next instant, a huge shadow passed over her head. Ye Qingtang looked up quietly and saw an ice phoenix over 100 meters wide flying above her. The ice phoenix was covered in icy blue flames which fell like rain over them as it passed by.

But before she could even blink, the entire iceberg had been covered in ice-fire!

The ice-fire conveyed not a shred of warmth and only made their surroundings even colder.

Ye Qingtang’s teeth were already chattering before she even touched the flame. No matter how hard she tried to circulate her energy, there was no way to combat the cold at all.

Just the scales from the ice phoenix were this terrifying...

Ye Qingtang hid quietly in the cave, her body as cold as ice as Little White Tiger tried to warm her up as much as possible so she wouldn’t freeze to death.

After a long time, the sky started to darken and the ice-flames gradually faded from the iceberg.

It was only then that Ye Qingtang climbed out of the cave, her fingertips already purple from the cold. Wherever the ice-flames had touched her body was shockingly cold and chafed painfully against her clothes.

She had thought that she was safe for now but froze as she climbed to the top of the mountain.

The ice-flames hadn’t vanished at all. They had converged to become a huge ice-flame monster!

The ice-flame monster roared as it sensed Ye Qingtang and rushed straight towards her.

Ye Qingtang felt the strong breath of the monster rushing towards her. Without thinking, she quickly grabbed Little White Tiger and streaked towards the sky.

But a pair of flaming wings burst forth from the monster as it flew up as well at a terrifying speed.

In an instant, the ice-flame monster had caught up to Ye Qingtang.

She couldn’t escape!

Ominous thoughts formed in Ye Qingtang’s mind. As she turned back and saw the monster rushing towards her, Ye Qingtang gritted her teeth, lifting her fingers to conjure up two black flames, and rushed towards the beast!

As the black flames and the ice-flames collided, powerful waves rippled through the sky.

The ice-flame monster howled angrily. It knocked the black flames away and rushed towards Ye Qingtang with its mouth wide open.

Ye Qingtang could feel her black flames have an effect on the ice monster. Without any other thoughts in her mind, she released all the energy she had, making the black flames around her burn even stronger. She threw Little White Tiger over her shoulder as she blocked the monster’s incoming mouth with both of her hands.

The ice-flame monster’s teeth pierced straight through Ye Qingtang’s arms, the excruciating pain spreading through her entire body as it instantly tore through her skin and flesh, leaving a searing burn in its wake. Ye Qingtang’s teeth broke as she gritted her teeth hard, not daring to let go.

It was going to bite her arms off if she even let go a little.

And that would only mean death.
