Chapter 1759: Demon Cave (3)

Used to the looks of disdain she had been receiving from the older demons, she was slightly confused as she saw the looks of fear in the young demons’ faces.

It was just that...

Why were they so afraid of her?

Ye Qingtang was a little uneasy but quickly understood the situation as she followed the young demons’ gazes and took a good look at herself.

Human skins were extremely popular among the demons and only a few older demons had the right to wear them. How could these young demons who didn’t even leave the camp ever get a human skin?

Thus...

These demons had mistaken Ye Qingtang for the older demons who wore human skin.

Ye Qingtang’s heart settled after she figured this out.

In fact, not to mention the adult demons, defeating the top ten of the Martial Arts Championship would be like child’s play to the young demons.

“Forget it.” Ye Qingtang rejected the little fiendish demons’ ‘offering’, feeling slightly appalled. There was no way she could stomach that piece of bloody meat.

Even though Ye Qingtang rejected them politely, this only made them even more anxious. Their eyes filled with fear as they looked at Ye Qingtang.

“We... we did not mean to offend you, Great Sage. Please spare us! It’s all our fault... Great Sage, how could we let you eat the lowly flesh of a Mongolian monster...” The young demons were almost in tears.

They were mere ants in the eyes of the adult demons. Had they not been in the same clan and camp, they would have been completely devoured. Not even their bones would have been spared. That said, they would still be eaten if they ever offended an adult demon.

Mongolian monster...

Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched a little.

It was a monster of the Paragon level!

A single blow from it would easily kill Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang was struck with the realization that she was right at the bottom of the food chain here. Even the food that the little demons ate was much stronger than her.

“You over there. Bring the earth fire lizards from the cave over with them. The Great General wants to eat them today,” a demon said as he walked out of the cave and looked at the little demons, then at Ye Qingting

They had treated her like an adult demon as well. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Earth fire lizards...

Ye Qingtang almost spat out blood again as she heard this.

Earth fire lizards were extremely ferocious creatures which could destroy entire countries. One had appeared in the Central Mainland a hundred years ago. It had destroyed an entire country, attracting the attention of the surrounding dynasties. They had only killed the earth fire lizard after sacrificing almost a million soldiers.

And it was rumored that that earth fire lizard had only been a cub.

The little demons had nothing else to say. They had just been worried over how to make up for their mistake of offending the adult demons. Now that they had been given an order, they stood obediently in front of Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang had no idea where the earth fire lizards were. Looking at the little demons gazing at her fearfully, she could only lie and say, “Alright, follow me.”

The little demons quickly nodded profusely. Afraid to let the Great Sage lead the way for them, they all ran in front, leading her forward cautiously.

Though Ye Qingtang was feeling extremely helpless and miserable, she made sure to maintain her cold expression.
