The present situation was very disadvantageous for Jiang Lang and the rest as Jiang Lang was like a crazed beast.

Beidou Demon Lord silently swallowed her saliva when he saw the battlefield situation.

“Stop, all of you.” A low shout traveled into everyone’s ears suddenly, and a repressive force followed instantly.

Both parties in the battle trembled when they heard that voice, and their actions halted for a moment.

A shocked Elder Xu was standing at the entrance of the courtyard with a gray-haired elderly.

That elderly’s brows were tightly-furrowed as his gaze swept across the chaotic scene.

“Uncle…” Jiang Shun was delighted when he saw the elderly.

That elderly was Jiang Kai, the elder brother of Domain Monarch and the uncle of Jiang Shun.

“Are you all done messing around? How unbecoming is it to cause such a huge ruckus in the Jiang Family?” Jiang Kai shouted coldly, and a look of displease could be seen on his face.

The Domain Monarch’s siblings had high statuses in the Jiang Family, and their skills were significantly higher than Jiang Shun’s generation. The Jiang Family had an extensive influence in this entire mainland while the Domain Monarch’s siblings were mostly guarded outside. Yet, unexpectedly, Jiang Kai was back today.

Jiang Qin and the rest did not dare to revolt before Jiang Kai, and only Jiang Lang’s bloodshot eyes were filled with a murderous look.

“Jiang Lang, look at you now.” Jiang Kai frowned while looking at Jiang Lang. He was very dissatisfied with this undisciplined younger generation.

Jiang Lang was not this deranged back then, but after he married Mo Yi, the couple became increasingly unbridled. They even killed Elder Meng’s son and left the Jiang Family.

Jiang Lang looked at Jiang Kai coldly.

“Why? Do you still want me to make a move?” Jiang Kai snickered, and a repressive force disseminated from his body instantly.

Under the repression, Jiang Lang turned pale slightly, but his eyes were like that of an unrestrained beast.

“What’s going on with you all?” Elder Xu had a perplexed look. The Ancient You Clan had some activity as the Domain Monarch was about to come out from seclusion; thus, the Domain Monarch’s siblings began returning to the head family.

Elder Xu felt that he had only left for a mere day, but why did the Jiang Family become like this?

“Uncle, Jiang Lang is crazy. He wants to kill me and Eldest Brother.” Jiang Qin immediately lodged a complaint when she saw Jiang Kai.

The Jiang Family had its own rules—no matter how they acted to outsiders, internal killing was strictly forbidden.

“You all joined forces to harm my wife and daughter. So what if I kill you all?” Jiang Lang snickered.

“Jiang Lang.” Jiang Kai’s expression darkened. He was still present, but Jiang Lang still dared to be so insolent.

“You have been away for many years, and you attacked your siblings the moment you returned. Have you forgotten the Jiang Family’s rules?”

“Family rules? If they did abide by the family rules, why would they attack my wife and daughter so cruelly?” Jiang Lang said coldly

Jiang Kai’s gaze swept across Jiang Qin and the rest before looking at Mo Yi and Ye Qingtang.

“Uncle, we did not. Mo Yi was the one who attacked first. She injured Yiming. Eldest Brother and I were angry and came to reason with her, but she suddenly attacked us. Uncle, if you don’t believe it, you can go and look at Yiming. Mo Yi’s attack was extremely fierce, and Yiming is completely crippled now…” Jiang Qin said quickly.

Jiang Yiming was indeed injured, and Mo Yi could not push the blame.

Since Mo Yi was the one who attacked first and violated the rules, there was nothing wrong for them to approach her.
