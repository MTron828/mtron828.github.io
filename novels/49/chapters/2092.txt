Chapter 2093: Soul-Absorbing Stage (3)

Ye Qingtang was speechless.

What was going on in the Temple of Paragon?

How could someone walk out of a portrait?

“Elder Bai, you’re saying that the Soul-Absorbing Stage doesn’t work on her?” An ethereal beauty walked out of the portrait. Her skin was fair and she walked over, her skirt trailing behind her. She walked over to Ye Qingtang and her charming almond-shaped eyes riveted on Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang could recognize her voice, it was the female voice that she had heard previously. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Yes, for now,” Elder Bai replied.

The woman bent over slightly to look at Ye Qingtang with a sharp gaze. She was quite tall, her height almost comparable to that of a man.

“That shouldn’t be the case... The Soul-Absorbing Stage is able to destroy any clone that exists, including our Holy Lord’s clone. Elder Yue, do you remember that we used the Soul-Absorbing Stage to destroy one of our Holy Lord’s clones back then?”

Once she said that another deep male voice was heard.

“Of course. We accompanied our Holy Lord to send the clone up to the Soul-Absorbing Stage back then.”

“Elder Bai, did anything strange happen when you sent her onto the stage earlier?” Elder Hua turned around to ask Elder Bai.

Elder Bai shook his head.

“It was the same as when our Holy Lord did it back then.”

“How peculiar.” Elder Hua’s almond-shaped eyes narrowed. Her eyes riveted on the gold chains that trapped Ye Qingtang. She suddenly lifted her arm, tapping on the chains lightly with her fingertip and the gold chains just turned into light, diffusing into the air.

“Elder Hua?” Elder Bai was stunned.

“Since we can’t figure out the reason, why don’t we just let this clone explain herself. She’s already back in the Temple of Paragon, she couldn’t possibly escape in front of us.” Elder Hua smiled.

Elder Bai didn’t say a word, he merely looked at Ye Qingtang with a cold expression.

The moment the gold chains disappeared, Ye Qingtang was relieved. She felt as though she had gotten rid of an ill omen and it felt really good.

Looking at Elder Bai and Elder Hua, who were both staring at her, Ye Qingtang quickly came up with a plan.

“Hold on, you must be mistaken. I’m not the clone that you’re looking for,” Ye Qingtang said.

She had to face this eventually. Since she had taken over the Holy Lord of Shadows’ Temple of Shadows... she had to take on the identity of the Holy Lord of Shadows also.

But...

She didn’t want to just die here.

Ye Qingtang was aware that she couldn’t escape from the Temple of Paragon with her capabilities.

Especially when they were bent on destroying her.

“Hm? That’s all you have to say?” The corners of Elder Hua’s lips kicked up, she seemed to have already predicted what Ye Qingtang was going to say.

“I have no idea how you got away from the Soul-Absorbing Stage, but do you really think that we’ll believe you when just self-proclaimed that you’re not a clone?”

“I’m speaking the truth. I’m really not a clone,” Ye Qingtang replied.

She could never admit it. Once she did, she would die!

Seeing that the two elders weren’t convinced, Ye Qingtang instantly spoke up again. “I speak the truth and only the truth. I’m sure that everyone at the Temple of Paragon is capable enough to distinguish whether I’m a clone or not?”
