“Fiendcelestial Beast…”

You Tong was astonished to see that the Fiendcelestial Beast was equally matched with the “Black Flame God”, one of the most powerful demonic beasts of the Ancient You Clan. Never had he expected that this mainland actually had a Fiendcelestial Beast.

“That is… Black Flame God…”

Elder Bai Kui was shocked as he inspected the Ancient You Clan demon.

Black Flame God was an ancient demonic beast that was extremely scarce; many masters at taming beasts could not find a single one even after devoting their entire lives to the purpose.

This type of demon was inherently violent, and when it reached its peak, it could turn into a flaming beast that could set everything in this world on fire.

“Roar!”

With a furious shout from the little white tiger, its claws lunged forward and instantly made a few bloody scratches on Black Flame God’s face.

“Roar… Roar!!” Black Flame God roared loudly in pain.

Subsequently, it held its head up high and sent the white tiger flying. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Many Ancient You Clan figures and Ye Family disciples scattered away in all directions swiftly in fear that they would lose their lives unexpectedly in the fierce battle between the two creatures.

Before everyone could react, a small ball of light resembling a little sun was condensed in Black Flame God’s mouth.

“Retreat!”

You Tong ordered immediately upon noticing the situation.

Without his reminder, all the Ancient You Clan masses had already withdrawn themselves from the scene and retreated backward successively.

When enraged, the Black Flame God’s fire energy would escalate tremendously, and its attacking manner was extremely broad, so much that it did not distinguish between enemy and ally.

In just a moment, the battlefield was already broken up. Everyone rushed into a mountain valley not far away, and every inch of the place became a battlefield smoked with blood.

Soon after, an explosion reverberated from the nearby Heaven City. The white tiger was heavily injured while Black Flame God seemed to be even more severely wounded; Both demonic creatures continued to tremble violently.

The war between the mainland and the Ancient You Clan’s main South army was finally full-blown in the mountain valley.

Night turned into day, and day turned into night once again. No one knew how much time had passed. The ground in the mountain valley was blanketed by blood, and broken limbs were strewn everywhere.

“Hahaha…!”

A shrill laugh sounded from a certain corner of the mountain valley. A Falling Sky Valley Peak Master’s abdomen was pierced by a long sword.

“You are very tenacious… but all of you must die,” an Ancient You Clan elderly said.

Swoosh!

However, the Peak Master did not utter a word and grabbed the Ancient You Clan elderly who stabbed him.

“What are you doing?” The elderly asked indifferently.

“Hahaha… Let’s go together.” Grotto-heaven Peak Master roared with laughter. “This is… the self-destruction… of a… Yang Lord!”

“What?!” The elderly’s expression changed drastically, and shock filled his face.

Once a cultivator reached the Yang Lord realm, the body could condense a spirit such that it had a chance of being reincarnated to become human once again even if the cultivator died. However, if one self-destructed… even the spirit would vanish into thin air!

“Are… you insane?!” The Ancient You Clan elderly hollered furiously.

As he saw that the Grotto-heaven Peak Master refused to let go of him, the elderly’s eyes flickered, and he slammed the Grotto-heaven Peak Master’s glabella with full force.

“Ow…”

Blood spewed out of the Grotto-heaven Peak Master’s mouth, and he trembled nonstop, but his grip on the elderly never released.

“Everyone… quickly run… run…”
