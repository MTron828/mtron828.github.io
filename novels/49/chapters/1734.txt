Chapter 1735: Attack From Both Sides (3)

Cold sweat burst out on Little White Tiger as it jumped over to one side to hide.

The ax couldn’t reach them but it split the thick, ten-meter-thick ice under their feet clean into two.

A giant crack cut through the boundless ice beneath their feet, splitting apart the ground as if the axe was slicing into warmed butter. Piercingly-cold water burst through the cracks then instantly froze into pillars crossing the gaps in the ice.

With a loud roar, the troll stepped forward. The moment the ground moved, another loud crack sounded from the ice. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Even though the beast was extremely powerful, it moved slowly, its large frame making his movements dull and clumsy. But even if that was the case, Ye Qingtang didn’t dare relax for a single minute.

With the troll’s strength, Little White Tiger and her would become mincemeat if they even took a single blow from it.

“Damn you, little Heavenly Demon. You ate so much earlier, it’s time for you to do something now!” The little white tiger shook as he saw the strong waves rippling from the troll as it approached.

The little Heavenly Demon’s face was blank in Ye Qingtang’s arms.

Ye Qingtang’s head hurt as she looked at the little Heavenly Demon. She had absolutely no control over when it was going to lift a hand to help...

At the same time, Little White Tiger was still sweating buckets trying to hide from the troll when a bright light started shining from the cracks the troll had made in the ice.

“That’s bad... there’s something...” Little White Tiger’s gaze turned downwards to the cracks below him. He could vaguely make out something shining like a star floating underneath.

In the next second, the water which had frozen into ice broke open as a creature resembling a cross between a fish and a bird burst forth towards the sky.

It’s entire body was icy blue, like an ice sculpture.

The creature emitted an ear-piercing neigh that seemed to stab right through their eardrums, right into their souls.

The moment Ye Qingtang heard the sound, it felt as though a strange force had pierced straight through her mind. She trembled in pain.

“Damn it, is this ever going to end?” Little White Tiger stared at the flying monster as it plunged straight at them.

Lord. A troll and a monster, with them in between. Both of them seemed to want their lives and both seemed like they could devour the sky and earth whole. Their situation was now a thousand times more difficult. Either of them could end them easily!

Ye Qingtang frowned as she fought against the pain the flying monster had inflicted on her. She surrounded herself with black flames as her eyes remained fixated on the monsters approaching her on the left and right.

Even though the troll was slow, the monster was extremely fast. With Little White Tiger’s speed, there was no way they were getting out of here.

That meant they could only fight!

The little Heavenly Demon in Ye Qingtang’s arms remained expressionless as it stared dumbly at the troll and the monster approaching on both sides. But as it noticed the black flames on Ye Qingtang’s body, its eyes widened.

Ye Qingtang had already tensed up and was already prepared to fight a bloody battle to the end when she suddenly noticed the little Heavenly Demon reach out and grab the black flames from her body.

“...” Ye Qingtang was speechless.

What was this little creature doing?
