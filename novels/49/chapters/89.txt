Chapter 90: The Road To Becoming Powerful (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang looked at the little lightning dragon, which swallowed a bag of spirit stones, with a sad expression.

It was unknown what method the mighty figure, who raised the dragon in the previous life, used to raise his dragon to be so “shiny” and “smooth.” It should be known that spirit stones were exorbitant and were sold by pieces. Just the “appetite” of the little lightning dragon was enough for it to eat until one ended up bankrupt.

This was still a cub that just came out of its shell. If it were a little bigger… the entire Ye family’s reserves would not be enough to feed it, much less Ye Qingtang. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Ye Qingtang suddenly felt that she might need to find a method to make money in the future; otherwise, she might be the first person in history to be starved to death by a dragon.

Days passed. Ye Qingtang received Mu Su’s letter of recommendation, and she could head to Xuanling Sect to participate in the entrance assessment just with this letter.

Xuanling Sect was quite far from Lin Town. Ye Qingtang had been readily prepared early to set out on the journey in advance.

On the day when Ye Qingtang hit the road, the Second Elder and Ye Ling had done many preparations for Ye Qingtang from early on and sent her off.

Even the Si family sent both Si Ye and Si Bai to show up.

“Uncle Ye,” Si Ye and Si Bai greeted.

Ye Qingtang nodded with a smile. Ever since Ye Qingtang became friendly with the Si family, the relationship between the Ye and Si improved increasingly as well, and they interacted much more on usual days.

Immediately, both of them walked towards Ye Qingtang.

“Grandfather told me to hand these things to you. He said that you’re too stubborn and was unwilling to send you off because he’s angry,” Si Bai said laughingly as the servants beside him subsequently placed the items that Master Si prepared on the carriage.

“Please apologize to grandfather Si on my behalf. I know he had my best interests at heart.” Ye Qingtang laughed.

Si Bai chuckled and said quietly, “Grandfather may have said that, but actually, he didn’t come personally as he was afraid of the sadness of separation.” As he spoke, he even winked at Ye Qingtang as a hint.

Ye Qingtang could not help but let out a laugh.

“When I return, I’ll thank grandfather Si personally.”

“The journey to Xuanling Sect is far. Grandfather is afraid that the journey isn’t safe, so…” Si Bai pushed Si Ye, who was beside him, forward to stand in front of Ye Qingtang.

Si Ye looked at Ye Qingtang a little awkwardly.

Similarly, Ye Qingtang had a face of confusion.

“My eldest brother is pretty skilled, and grandfather made him to be your coachman.” Si Bai laughed.

“…” At this point, Ye Qingtang really did not know whether to laugh or cry.

The dignified Young Master Si was actually acting as a coachman for her?

How high was her status?!

Even Ye Ling and the Second Elder were surprised by Master Si’s action.

It can’t be that the he took a fancy on Tang Tang and was ready to sweet-talk Tang Tang into becoming her granddaughter-in-law, can it?

“There’s no need for this, I think? Big brother Si may have things to tend to as well. I can manage on my own,” Ye Qingtang declined politely. She knew that Master Si specially made this arrangement as he was unaware that the Great Elder had died and was probably afraid that the Great Elder arranged for someone to sneak an attack on her on the journey there.

“Don’t stand on ceremony anymore. Grandfather said that if eldest brother does not safely send you to Xuanling Sect, he can dream of returning to the Si residence,” Si Bai gloated happily. His body was weak and would be unable to withstand the bumpy journey. Thus, an assignment like fetching people would naturally fall on Si Ye.

Ye Qingtang looked helplessly at Si Ye, who had a weird expression.

“I am unrelated. Since it is grandfather’s orders, just agree and put his mind at ease.”

Ye Qingtang declined grandfather Si’s protection quite a number of times and should she reject it again this time… Si Ye felt that his grandfather might just explode.

Seeing so, there was no way Ye Qingtang could reject, and she could only reply, “I’ll have to trouble big brother Si then.”

Si Ye nodded slightly.

Ye Ling originally arranged for his henchman to send Ye Qingtang to Xuanling Sect but could only trouble Si Ye to make the trip instead due to Master Si’s stubbornness.

Ye Ling and Ye Qingtang said their goodbyes for a while, and when he saw that it was time, he let Ye Qingtang set out on the journey without saying much.

Ye Qingtang got onto the carriage, and Si Ye really sat on the position for the coachman, escorting Ye Qingtang out of town from outside the carriage.
