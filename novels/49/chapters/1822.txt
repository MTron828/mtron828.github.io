Chapter 1823: Fire Demon (1)

“What are they?” Little White Tiger looked at the two halves of the key.

Little White Tiger had seen Ye Qingtang retrieve the two halves of the key but it didn’t see the illusion. As a result, it didn’t know what these two pieces were used for. It thought Ye Qingtang had just kept them on a casual whim.

“This is the key that the True Gods used to imprison the Heavenly Demons. Since I can’t use my Dharma treasures here, I want to see if I can use this holy artefact instead.” Ye Qingtang looked at the broken key in her hand.

This mystic realm was very dangerous and the power of the Cursed True God was very adversarial toward human beings. The rain of fire was too powerful for them. Even if they could stay in the temple forever, how would they be able to destroy the body of the Cursed True God and escape from this realm if they did so?

Ye Qingtang didn’t want to be trapped in this godforsaken place forever.

Little White Tiger’s eyes lit up.

“Let’s try?”

Ye Qingtang nodded. With the broken key in hand, she tried walking out of the temple.

The ground was covered in raging flames. Hot, bubbling lava flowed down from the sky in an endless torrential explosion of heat.

Ye Qingtang took a deep breath and walked into the flames, placing her body under the pouring lava.

The moment the flames touched Ye Qingtang, a faint layer of light suddenly spread out from her body.

In the blink of an eye, the halo of light engulfed her entire body, forming a holy shield around her. The lava instantly dissipated the moment it made contact with the holy light shield.

The corners of Ye Qingtang’s lips curved in a slight smile.

It seemed this key was rather useful.

Thereafter, Ye Qingtang turned back into the temple. She looped each half of the key with a leather band, placing one around her own neck and the other around Little White Tiger’s. She then picked up Little Heavenly Demon.

Little White Tiger glanced at the key hanging around its neck with an incredulous expression.

“Why do I feel like... this thing is similar to a dog collar...”

“...” Ye Qingtang was speechless.

What kind of comparison was that?

“Do you want to be a dog?”

“...Of course not!” Little White Tiger was affronted.

It was a white tiger! Why the hell would it want to be a dog?!

“Then just rein in your wild imagination.” It could go ahead and imagine being a dog if it wanted to. Why did it have to include her in the comparison? Stupid tiger.

“...” Little White Tiger opened its mouth to retort, but in the end, it shut its jaws submissively.

With the holy artefact protecting them, Ye Qingtang and Little White Tiger stepped into the rain of fire. They breathed a huge sigh of relief when no harm came to them.

Only the heavens would know how long this fiery rain would last. With this key, they didn’t have to worry about being trapped here. Relying on the key’s protection, they could finally weave through the rain of fire.

Walking amongst the raging flames, Ye Qingtang saw many charred black bodies of all sorts of monsters.

The smell of roasted meat wafted over, and Little Heavenly Demon could not stop the drool coming out of his mouth, it was salivating uncontrollably. Noticing its pitiful face, Ye Qingtang reached out to carve off some roasted monster meat to feed it.

At least this saved Ye Qingtang the hassle of hunting and cooking beasts. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

It was really very convenient.

However, Ye Qingtang didn’t dare to linger too long in this area. Although the key was protecting them, who knew what other strange things would happen to her again.
