Chapter 1794: Stalemate (2)

“You’re asking to die!” The Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General was livid by Ye Qingtang’s words and flew even faster, appearing right behind Ye Qingtang.

When Ye Qingtang turned around to look and saw the Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General reaching for her, in a panic, she activated the power of the Deity Ocean within her. The moment the powers of the Deity Ocean were awoken, Ye Qingtang’s figure warped and vanished.

Safe for the moment, Ye Qingtang let out a sigh of relief and looked at the other space she was in. Her head was about to explode.

The Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General had his eyes on her, so it didn’t matter even if she could use the power of the Deity Ocean to cross space. She was going to return to her original location in a short while.

Ye Qingtang was in despair. She had a feeling that the Deity Ocean was sending her back repeatedly because its will had not been fulfilled. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“I wonder if you’re saying... I have to destroy the bones of the Cursed True God before I can leave this damned place...” Ye Qingtang’s head was about to burst.

She had thought that merging with the Deity Ocean accidentally would allow her to finally leave this place but...

She was back to square one.

She couldn’t count on the Deity Ocean. The only way to leave this damned place was to destroy the bones of the Cursed True God.

Ye Qingtang sighed heavily. As she felt the world spinning yet again, she rolled her eyes.

She had to go back again.

And as expected, after a wave of giddiness, Ye Qingtang was once again back on the mountain peak and in front of her was the dark face of the Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General.

The Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General smiled wickedly as he saw Ye Qingtang reappear and he swiped at her.

Ye Qingtang could only probe at the Deity Ocean’s power once again and escape back into the other space. She vanished once again in front of his eyes.

The Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General was speechless.

Damn it!

“You little piece of trash, how dare you hide from me!” the Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General roared.

There was a short period of time when Ye Qingtang crossed space when she would experience giddiness due to the distortion in time and space when the Deity Ocean twisted space. But Ye Qingtang could still hear the angry roar of the Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General.

How dare she hide from him?

Only a fool wouldn’t.

Unable to win against a fight with him and not able to escape from him, Ye Qingtang could only cross space again and again to escape him.

She could feel the energy of the Deity Ocean being consumed every time she crossed space, and she could feel that the energy was being used up faster and faster as well.

Even worse was that...

She realized that once the energy from the Deity Ocean faded, she would slow back down to the speed of a turtle.

How long would she Deity Ocean hold out for? She had no idea and dreaded to find out...

On the mountain peak, the face of the Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General was getting darker and darker as his expressionless face fixated on the flickering Ye Qingtang. Every time he reached out and was about to crush the little piece of trash, she would slip sneakily into the other space.

After countless times of her escaping, the Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General’s patience was running out, and the anger in his eyes intensified. He was about to go mad.

Before she knew it, they had been in this stalemate for two to three days.
