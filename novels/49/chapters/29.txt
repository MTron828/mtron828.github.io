Chapter 30: Buoys (3)

Although people were still currently unaware of a Buoy’s purpose, but in a few years, news of it being able to nourish a spirit root would be circulated. A Buoy was in fact, one of the world’s few external nutrient sources for cultivating a spirit root. Therefore, though a thousand gold was a high price to pay for a single piece now, after people learned of its purpose, a Buoy’s fetching price would increase exponentially. Even ten thousand gold per piece would be deemed insufficient then.

So, who’s to say Ye Qingtang had made a dead loss? She had made a killing instead!

“There’s one more matter requiring your kind assistance. If there’s any more of these Buoys in any of your fine establishments, I’ll be buying them all.” Ye Qingtang made the request to the manager in all smiles. The Pavilion of Treasures had branches all across the continent. If she gained their cooperation, she would not have to worry about depleting her supply of spirit root supplements.

The manager on the other hand was totally bewildered.

Miss Ye is not a lunatic, I suppose?

The manager did not accede to Ye Qingtang’s request straight away but agreed to look into it. He became prudent of her enthusiasm in Buoys. Was there another purpose when she wanted to buy them in such bulk?

Ye Qingtang was not in a hurry nonetheless. The dozen and more pieces of Buoys she had just acquired were enough to last her quite some time.

Aside from those deadweight Buoys, Ye Qingtang had chosen to purchase the scales of an Ifrit as well.

Ifrits were spirit beasts which roamed the tablelands of magma. They were vicious beasts, possessing scales which had a high degree of fire resistance. However, due to its sheer size, the weight of its scales impeded its intended use for forging equipment and thus, turned out to be a white elephant instead.

Ye Qingtang’s choice of purchases were so absurd that the manager considered his task, as her shopping assistant, was becoming quite a cross to bear. Was she a connoisseur of junk for real?

In order to store all her purchases, including those gigantic Ifrit’s scales, Ye Qingtang bought a dimension ring directly from the boutique as well.

And for Mu Su, who had accompanied Han Cangming in Ye Qingtang’s covert observation for nearly half a day, he became quite awkward as he witnessed her relishing in those junk she bought.

“Your Highness… this Miss Ye had quite a unique eye for things….” Mu Su faltered as he made the remark and kept an eye on Han Cangming’s demeanor.

“Those pieces of junk were bought on her own accord! That had nothing to do with me!” was the hidden pretext Mu Su wished to bring across to him.

Han Cangming did not react to Mu Su’s remark but just continued to watch her in a contemplative manner.

Ye Qingtang had taken full advantage of her rebirth and managed to turn a profit from all her prior knowledge. After making her rounds, ensuring there were no other essential items to purchase, she left the boutique feeling contented. Just as she reached the foyer, she stumbled upon Si Bai and his attendant, who were just about to leave as well.

It was a pleasant coincidence, since Ye Qingtang had intended to visit the Si household again, to keep up her end of the bargain by restoring Si Bai’s health. She left together with them, for convenience’s sake.

“….” Mu Su watched in silence, as Ye Qingtang left the premises with a seemingly well-acquainted and handsome young man. He turned around to face his liege, his Highness….

Who remained impassive with his usual poker face.

Mu Su made a facepalm discreetly. Your Highness, please develop your sense of urgency!

This made up his mind. He had to create an opportunity for his Highness and Ye Qingtang to meet up during her requested meeting!

You have to play your part when you want her to conceive your child!

“I see you’ve bought quite a number of Buoys and Ifrit’s scales.” Si Bai brought up the subject of Ye Qingtang’s peculiar purchases while they were on their way to the Si’s residence.

Si Bai knew what Buoys and Ifrit’s scales were, but he had not heard anything special about their purposes.

“Yup.” Ye Qingtang did not intend to keep a lid on her purchases anyway.
