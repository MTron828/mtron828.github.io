Chapter 501: Stirring Things Up (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“I’ll spare you three lowly people today. Go back and tell Yunxiao Sect that I am a Xuanling Sect disciple, and my name is Ye Qingtang!” Afterward, Ye Qingtang turned around and left.

Noticing it, the Blood Moon Sect Elder chased after hurriedly.

“Ye Qingtang, what deep-seated hatred do you have with Xuanling Sect…” The Blood Moon Sect Elder looked at Ye Qingtang meaningfully.

Ye Qingtang’s actions were completely to draw Yunxiao Sect’s hatred towards Xuanling Sect…

Ye Qingtang did not explain anything.

Everything she did today was not to harm Xuanling Sect but to save it.

Deep down, Ye Qingtang was aware that Yunxiao Sect would annihilate Xuanling Sect not long later, and it was no longer important whether she beat up Yunxiao Sect disciples as a Xuanling Sect disciple.

What she needed to do now was to make Yunxiao Sect hate her to the core.

If the plan to pretend to be a Blood Moon Sect Guardian failed and she was unable to use the Blood Moon Sect as a balance against Yunxiao Sect, she could make use of Yunxiao Sect’s profound hatred towards her to prevent Xuanling Sect from being wiped out.

At this juncture, if she made Yunxiao Sect hate her utterly yet unable to find her in Xuanling Sect, Yunxiao Sect definitely would not act rashly. According to her understanding of the Yunxiao Sect, they would definitely trap everyone in Xuanling Sect and force her to show up.

As such, Ye Qingtang would have time to strengthen herself and return to Xuanling Sect to rescue it.

Ye Qingtang was aware that she was taking a huge gamble.

With the hope of Xuanling Sect’s survival!

“Go!” Ye Qingtang waved.

A while later, Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Sect Elder arrived near the mountain. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

This mountain was owned solely by Yunxiao Sect, and outsiders were not allowed to enter.

There were many entrances to the mountain, and each entrance was guarded by two Yunxiao Sect disciples to prevent outsiders from entering.

“Whoever that is coming, stop right now!”

Two Yunxiao Sect outer sect disciples outside an entrance to the mountain shouted at Ye Qingtang.

“Are you all Yunxiao Sect disciples?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“No sh*t!”

In the next second, Ye Qingtang repressed the two Yunxiao Sect disciples at the speed of lightning without giving them a chance to continue speaking.

“I am Xuanling Sect’s Ye Qingtang!”

After leaving that sentence, Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Sect Elder entered the mountain.

In this half a day, Ye Qingtang severely injured over ten outer sect disciples and two inner sect disciples from Yunxiao Sect.

From the words of a Yunxiao Sect disciple, she even learned that there was actually a Yunxiao Sect elder in the mountain.

Under Ye Qingtang’s torture to extort a confession, the Yunxiao Sect disciple recounted that the Yunxiao Sect elder’s personal disciple was injured in a mission, and because there was sufficient spirit energy in this mountain, the Yunxiao Sect elder brought his disciple here to recuperate at the fastest speed.

After learning of the exact location, Ye Qingtang rushed there with the Blood Moon Sect Elder.

“Ye Qingtang, are you crazy!” The Blood Moon Sect Elder paled. “Forget that you beat those Yunxiao Sect disciples up, but you still want to provoke a Yunxiao Sect elder now. Do you know what cultivation realm those elders are at?!”

Every Yunxiao Sect elder was at least at the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three. Wanting to kill a powerful figure at that realm was technically no different from crushing an ant!

“You’re scared?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“I’m scared?” The Blood Moon Sect Elder scoffed. “Back then when my martial skills were at the peak, there was no difference between those so-called supposed sects and ants to me!”

“Since that’s the case, then cut the crap.” Ye Qingtang headed forward quickly without bothering with the Blood Moon Sect Elder.
