Chapter 1745: The Strange Mountain Valley (1)

Since she had no idea what the place in front would have in store for them, Ye Qingtang decided to bring Little Heavenly Demon and Little White Tiger for a hunt first.

After Little Heavenly Demon had killed a few weaker monsters, Ye Qingtang offered a portion of their flesh to it after she cooked the rest with her black flame and stored them in her space ring. It was better to be prepared in case they needed it later.

Their main concern was that Little Heavenly Demon was going to eat Little White Tiger if it got too desperately hungry. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

After they had prepared thoroughly, Ye Qingtang brought the two of them to the valley which was warming up. But the moment Ye Qingtang stepped into the valley, a thick demonic aura hit them and surrounded the entire valley.

The valley had looked so bright from the outside, but now that they were inside it was slightly dark and blurry. Not only that, there was also a nauseating stench of evil to go with the demonic aura.

At the entrance of the valley, Ye Qingtang felt as though she had entered another world. The temperature here wasn’t cold but their surroundings were extremely strange. There were many plants growing on the mountains on both sides but their leaves were dark purple and green...

Ye Qingtang kept her guard up. Even though it was a demonic aura as well, the aura from Little Heavenly Demon and this place felt vastly different.

It was clear that Little Heavenly Demon was being affected by the demonic aura as well. Previously it had been very lively, but was now extremely drowsy and it lay in Ye Qingtang’s arms, fast asleep. Ye Qingtang tried waking it up but Little Heavenly Demon had no reaction at all and remained in a stupor.

“This place is a little odd.” Little White Tiger scrunched its nose up. Its sense of smell had always been sensitive and the demonic aura and stench of evil in this valley was torturous to him.

Ye Qingtang sensed something off about the valley as well, but as she took a look around she realized that apart from the sole road in the valley, there were no other roads to be seen. The mountains walled them off from any other paths.

As for the sky above, it was covered in dark clouds as thunder rumbled ominously. They could see lightning flash past from time to time. Little stones rained from above as lightning struck the boulders.

It would be even more dangerous for them to ignore this route and cross the mountains from above.

“We can only try.” Ye Qingtang took a deep breath. She felt extremely pessimistic about this place but could not act on her suspicions if she wanted to leave this place as quickly as possible.

They were left with no choice.

Ye Qingtang was extra cautious as Little Heavenly Demon was still sleeping. Before they had even traveled far into the valley, Ye Qingtang noticed big puddles of dark purple fluid on the ground under them. The dark purple fluid was as thick as glue and it stained the entire ground a strange color as it let of a revolting smell.

“This... what is this?” Ye Qingtang walked over to the puddle and could vaguely make out some flesh and bones in it.

“It looks like the blood of some creature,” Little White Tiger said as it sniffed the puddle.
