Chapter 712: You Will Not Die If You Don’t Seek Death (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“That sword was bestowed to me personally by my Master and has a special meaning to me, yet you ruined it like that. It would be inappropriate if you don’t give me corresponding compensation, wouldn’t it?

Ye Qingtang looked at Chu Yi without emotion. She never thought that this Tiangang Sect disciple would actually be so shameless.

Before the sparring, they had already agreed that no one would be responsible regardless of whose sword was broken.

Yet this Chu Yi actually came looking for trouble?

Ye Qingtang was not a fool. When she heard Chu Yi mentioning compensation, she knew that he had taken a fancy on her Millennium Meteoric Iron.

“Oh? So how do you want me to compensate?” Ye Qingtang said flatly.

Chu Yi and the youth beside him exchanged a look, deeply satisfied with Ye Qingtang’s amenable attitude. “I’m not asking for much. As long as you give me all the Millennium Meteoric Iron in your hands, this matter can be considered to be over.” Chu Yi spoke relatively generously as though his demand had given Ye Qingtang a lot of face.

However, in Ye Qingtang’s ears, this was unbelievably ridiculous.

“What if I don’t compensate?”

Chu Yi’s eyes sharpened. “If you don’t compensate me, don’t blame us for being hard on you then.”

Then, Chu Yi shot a look at the youth, who immediately unsheathed his sword, putting on a clear threatening stance.

“I’ll give you two options. First, hand over the Millennium Meteoric Iron, and we will be compassionate enough to spare your life. Second, we will kill you and then take the Millennium Meteoric Iron. Live or die, you decide for yourself.”

Ye Qingtang looked at the two domineering people before her, and her lips curled into a seeming smile.

“I choose the third option.”

Ye Qingtang’s eyes turned cold immediately.

“I want the Millennium Meteoric Iron and your lives.”

“How cocky!” Chu Yi scoffed coldly. “Junior brother, there’s no need to go easy on her. Since she is so confident, there’s no need for us to say anymore bullsh*t to her!”

Chu Yi and that youth immediately wielded their swords and charged towards Ye Qingtang. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Ye Qingtang stood rooted to the ground as she swept a nonchalant look across the two figures dashing towards her.

“Come at me, reckless people!” The little white tiger immediately opened its mouth as it watched the two people charging towards them, wanting to spit all over their faces.

However, Ye Qingtang lifted her hand and stopped the little white tiger.

“There’s no need.”

In the blink of an eye, Chu Yi and his junior brother were already right in front of Ye Qingtang, and two swords stabbed right towards her chest.

A glint flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes, and she suddenly raised her hands!

Clang!

Two clear sounds rang in the air all of a sudden.

Ye Qingtang used two fingers from each hand to clasp the two extremely sharp blades effortlessly, freezing the two knives in mid-air.

“What…” Chu Yi was stunned as he looked at Ye Qingtang in disbelief.

How could it be?

Ye Qingtang’s eyes flickered, and her smile deepened.

“It’s my turn.”

The moment she spoke, an overbearing aura suddenly exploded from Ye Qingtang, surging directly towards Chu Yi and his junior brother like an enormous wave. At the same time, their swords crackled and broke into countless broken shards.
