“Holy Son Ming Gu, Holy Son Ming Wang is asking for you.” Xue Fu cleared his throat quietly before speaking out from outside the door.

But Ming Gu seemed oblivious to Xue Fu’s voice. He continued to concentrate on polishing the article in his hand.

Xue Fu spoke up another two times but failed to get a response from Ming Gu. He sighed in frustration and had no choice but to turn back.

“My humble greetings, Holy Son Ming Wang. Holy Son Ming Gu is...” Xue Fu stood respectfully before Ming Wang. Seeing Xue Fu arrive alone, Ming Wang already knew the outcome before Xue Fu finished his sentence.

Ming Wang remained impassive. He just continued to study the file in his hand as he commanded half-heartedly, “Bring him here.”

Xue Fu didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. Bring him here? He could only dream of doing that.

Ming Gu was so obsessed now that he didn’t even care about his own family anymore. He would probably go into a frenzied killing spree if they tried to force him to come.

“Holy Son Ming Wang, why don’t you go to visit Holy Son Ming Gu?” Xue Fu suggested.

They were twins but the relationship between Ming Wang and Ming Gu was extremely strained now.

It was all because Ming Wang disregarded Ming Gu’s wishes and locked him up, not allowing him to stop the Holy Lord from leaving. From then on, Ming Gu was no longer willing to see Ming Wang.

The rift between the two Holy Sons was a bane to those unfortunate undead in the Temple of Shadows. They were tense with fear whenever they had to face the unstable Ming Gu—fearful of accidentally triggering him and dying a horrible death.

Ming Wang looked up and fixed his black eyes impassively on Xue Fu.

Xue Fu gave a bitter smile. “Holy Lord Ming Gu misses the Holy Lord. Although you instructed us not to interfere with the Holy Lord’s matters, Holy Son Ming Gu cannot go on like this. I wonder if we can try and locate the Holy Lord’s whereabouts? Even just the knowledge of the Holy Lord’s location might calm him down.”

Ming Gu was worried that the Holy Lord of Shadows was repeating a previous departure. The first time this happened, the Holy Lord left without a word and was gone for 10,000 years.

“No.” Ming Wang was quick to object.

With an inward sigh, Xue Fu glanced at the impassive Ming Wang and he couldn’t help grumbling quietly on the inside.

You say that but it’s clear you don’t mean it. Since you’re so restrained, beware of choking to death one day from your own suppressed feelings.

Xue Fu had accidentally witnessed Ming Wang staring at the portrait of the Holy Lord for an entire night. Although he didn’t say anything, Ming Wang missed the Holy Lord just as much as that obsessed Ming Gu.

Just as Xue Fu was mulling over how to reconcile these two Holy Sons, one of the temple elders hurried over. He was so agitated that his bones clattered noisily.

“My great Holy Son Ming Wang. The Holy Lord. She is back!” The elder exclaimed in joy.

What?!

Xue Fu was stunned. Before he had a chance to speak, he felt a gust of wind blow past him. Turning around, Ming Wang had already gone.

“...”

Where had all that calm composure gone?

Ming Wang hurried to the grand hall of the Temple of Shadows. He saw that slender figure, the image of whom had long been imprinted in his soul.

An imperceptible hint of joy surfaced in those cool, impassive black eyes.

Ye Qingtang stood within the grand hall. She lifted her eyes and saw Ming Wang.

She was... back...

Ye Qingtang gave an inward sigh of helplessness. She never imagined that she would ever return to the Temple of Shadows of her own free will. But since she decided to come back, there was nothing she could complain about.

As she gazed at Ming Wang, her lips curved upwards into a familiar smile.

“Miss me?”
