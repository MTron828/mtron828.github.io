Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Xiong Feng said, “Valley Master, there’s a young man outside the hall who wishes to meet you.”

“Oh?” Perfected Xuanchen looked down slightly. “Who is that? Why does he want to meet me?”

Xiong Feng deliberated for a moment and replied. “That young man’s name is Ye Chen. He has looked up to you for a long time and begged me to meet you. I saw that he was sincere and honest, and thus I came to report.”

Xiong Feng did not dare to directly tell Perfected Xuanchen that Ye Qingtang was here to be apprenticed to him.

Perfected Xuanchen did not have any reaction, but Yan Shu from aside frowned when he heard Xiong Feng, and he looked at Xiong Feng with dissatisfaction.

Everyone in Falling Sky Valley knew that Warden Xiong was the greediest.

How could an ordinary young man meet the Valley Master of Falling Sky Valley just because he wanted to? Xiong Feng naturally knew about this logic as well.

Yet, he still came to report this. Looking at him, it seemed that he had accepted many good things from the person. Otherwise, he would not do such a thing.

Yan Shu was dissatisfied but did not dare to say anything as Xiong Feng was a warden, and it was hard for him, a disciple, to argue with a warden. Secondly…

Yan Shu looked at Perfected Xuanchen and felt a little stifled.

Ever since his master became Falling Sky Valley’s acting Valley master, there was quite a lot of noise in the valley. Apart from the Valley Master, there were Peak Masters, and his Master was originally a Peak Master as well.

After the old Valley Master was severely injured, his Master was given the acting Valley Master position.

When his Master became the Valley Master from a Peak Master, the other Peak Masters were dissatisfied. They showed outward devotion but opposed him in secret. To establish peace and harmony within Falling Sky Valley, his Master usually made his disciples give in to disciples from other peaks.

As Perfected Xuanchen’s disciple, Yan Shu listened to orders. He was very accommodative to others in the valley and did not stir up trouble.

Xiong Feng saw that Perfected Xuanchen did not reply after a long time and added on immediately. “I saw that the young man is pretty gifted and relatively sincere. He holds great admiration for you. That young man is waiting outside the hall right now. Are you willing to meet him, Valley Master?”

“He is already outside the hall?” Perfected Xuanchen said slowly.

“Yes.”

Perfected Xuanchen replied. “Forget it. Since he is here already, let him in then.”

Xiong Feng was delighted when he heard that, but he did not dare to show it on his face. He responded immediately. “Yes. I’ll bring him in now.”

Perfected Xuanchen nodded.

Xiong Feng immediately exited the hall.

As Yan Shu watched Xiong Feng leave hurriedly, his brows furrowed slightly. He looked at his Master hesitantly, wanting to say something.

Outside the hall, Xiong Feng approached Ye Qingtang with a smile. “Little brother, the Valley master has agreed to meet you. However, I did not tell him that you’re here to be apprenticed to him. You should think of how to tell him when you meet him later.”

“Thank you, Warden Xiong,” Ye Qingtang said.

Xiong Feng laughed. “You’re too polite. It’s also because I saw that you have pretty good natural talent and didn’t want it to go to waste.”

Ye Qingtang smiled without saying anything.

However, the little white tiger aside puckered its lips.

What pretty good natural talent? It should be pretty good bribes instead, isn’t it? ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Alright. Follow me into the hall now,” said Warden Xiong.

“Okay.” Ye Qingtang nodded slightly and let the little white tiger and silver wolf wait outside the hall while she followed Xiong Feng into the hall.
