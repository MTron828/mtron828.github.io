Chapter 2658: I’m Here To Kill You (3)

The more they could not enter the black tower, the more curious they became.

It was not just that they cared about how many legacy treasures were in the black tower. They were just curious about the link between them and the black tower.

After a while, Ye Qingtang slowly walked towards the tower again. However, she had just taken a few steps when the previous feeling assaulted her again. She could only stop and return the way she came.

“Sister Ah Yao, I still cannot get close at all.” Ye Qingtang sighed.

“Forget it, let’s leave this place first,” said the Paragon.

Anyway, the strange circumstances of the black tower were only targeted at the two of them. To others, there was nothing special about the tower. It was just an ordinary building that did not attract anyone’s attention.

As much time as they wasted time here, they would still not be able to approach the black tower. It was better for them to search for the Fourth Domain legacy first.

“0kay.”

After pondering for a moment, Ye Qingtang nodded and decided to travel with the Paragon.

Not long after Ye Qingtang and the Paragon left the black tower, a cold glint flashed across the Paragon’s eyes as she looked into the distant void. At that moment, even Ye Qingtang felt an inexplicable pressure coming from afar.

“Sister Ye Yue, be careful. We are being targeted,” the Paragon warned Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly. This aura was extraordinary and the practitioner’s level was probably on par with that of an Immortal Emperor...

“MJho are you? Since you’re here, why don’t you show yourself?” Ye Qingtang shouted into the distant void.

As Ye Qingtang finished her sentence, a man with an inexplicable smile appeared in front of Ye Qingtang and the Paragon.

“‘Han Cangming?! ” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Ye Qingtang’s expression changed when she saw the man in the air. It was as if she was facing a formidable enemy.

Ye Qingtang would never forget Han Cangming’s face. When she first came to this era, Han Cangming had his eyes on the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline in her body. If not for Ling ??????????? she might have already died in Han Cangming’s hands.

However, Ye Qingtang had been cultivating in seclusion in the Great Immortal Temple for the past two years and did not receive any news about Han Cangming.

“Han Cangming___ the supreme Immortal Emperor of the Divine Venerate Domain?” The Paragon asked Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang nodded and said, “Yes?_ Sister Ah Yao, he is here for me. Leave first... help me find the Great Immortal Temple camp and tell them about my current situation. They will come and save me.”

The Paragon frowned at Ye Qingtang’s words. She sized up Han Cangming.

“‘Immortal Emperor, out of respect for me, can you not make things difficult for my sister?” the Paragon asked.

Han Cangming smiled at the Paragon. “What if I say no?

The expression of the Paragon turned completely cold. “Then you can come and try. I just

entered the Divine Venerate Domain and don’t wish to have anything to do with the Immortal Emperors from the Third Domain. But if you want to attack my sister , I’m afraid I cannot let you do that.”

“Sister Ah Yao___”

Warmth surged in Ye Qingtang’s heart when she saw the Paragon’s reaction. Ye Qingtang did not expect that the Paragon would go against Demon God Han Cangming for her sake..
