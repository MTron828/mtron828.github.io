Chapter 2288: Consecutive Breakthroughs (1)

They were still teenagers after all and inexperienced. If Ye Qingtang had not led them through that encounter, they would probably still be the same as those other teenagers in the academy. Leading comfortable, pampered lives in the academy. Venturing outside to train now and then, but nowhere too dangerous.

There was a certain disparity between an academy and a sect.

Most of the teenagers in the academy were still in training. Their teachers might be strict but they would still ensure their safety. They would seldom bring them to dangerous training grounds.

But sects were different. After entering a sect, you were part of it and had to serve it wholeheartedly. The only thing of importance was that one had to fight for the glory of the sect. Even if you received a dangerous mission, you had to treat death and injury as if they were common-day occurrences.

Ye Qingtang had stayed in both an academy and a sect.

In her opinion, academies were too soft. As a result, Lei Yan and the rest had no idea just how dark and cruel the world could be.

Ye Qingtang allowed those brats a few days’ rest in the city and also took it as an opportunity to unleash her suppressed cultivation level.

In case something went wrong during the process, Ye Qingtang flew out of the city in the middle of the night. Finding a remote spot in the wilderness, she finally settled down and gradually released the suppressed energy inside her.

It was not a complicated process to unleash energy. But it had to be done slowly to allow enough time for the body to adjust.

After making all the proper preparations, Ye Qingtang finally unleashed the suppressed energy inside her.

The energy was like a wild beast who had been caged for a long time. Ye Qingtang had just made a small opening when the energy surged madly out of her body.

The force was even more ferocious than Ye Qingtang expected!

In the blink of an eye, with just that first round of energy unleashed, Ye Qingtang had already risen by one Heaven level!

A beam of light surged out of her body, shooting straight into the sky!

Ye Qingtang calmed her heart before releasing another bout of energy.

As she continued to release bouts of energy, Ye Qingtang’s cultivation stage increased by leaps and bounds!

A thunderous boom rang out as a beam of golden light descended, and the light completely engulfed Ye Qingtang.

This breakthrough was more earth-shattering than the other previous ones. The boom was like thunder, echoing across miles and miles!

Divine Lord level!

The sleeping Lei Yan and gang suddenly heard the booming sound. Having already honed a keen sense of vigilance inside the Evil Soul Forest, those teenagers all woke up.

“What’s that noise?” Lei Yan leaped up from his bed and pushed open the window.

A beam of golden light shot down at a mountain not far off. It seemed to turn the night into day!

“What the hell? It’s the middle of the night but someone is breaking through to the Divine Lord level?” Lei Yan rubbed his eyes. He was wondering which practitioner was having a breakthrough now.

If this was in the past, Lei Yan would have been insanely jealous at the sight of someone achieving the Divine Lord stage.

But now…

He was already at the Divine Lord stage himself. This was nothing special!

Lei Yan was just about to fall back into bed to sleep when a rumbling noise could be heard.

An even more intense beam of golden light had appeared in the vicinity of the first beam. Completely stunned, all notions of sleep left Lei Yan.

“Are you… kidding me? That person underwent another breakthrough? The Divine Lord Second Heaven level??!”RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com
