“I’ve long heard that Wind Sword Sect has many spirit pills, including the Elegant Moon Pill which you all most likely have. Forget it… Each of you just has to compensate two bottles of the Elegant Moon Pill, and this matter can be considered to be over,” Ye Qingtang said with a smile.

The Wind Sword Sect disciples’ faces darkened.

The Wind Sword Sect’s Elegant Moon Pill had similar effects as Xuanling Sect’s Xi Spirit Pill but was more effective.

Outer sect disciples like them would only be given three bottles every month.

Ye Qingtang shaved almost one month’s quantity away from them!

“Why? Unwilling?” Ye Qingtang looked at the Wind Sword Sect disciples’ hesitant faces and smiled faintly. She waved her Demonic Blood Sword, and an aura was shot out from the blade.

In just an instant, the sword aura swept across the forest nearby, and like a wave, all the trees within a hundred meters away were chopped!

A loud crashing sound pierced everyone’s ears.

Everyone stared at the flattened forest with their mouths hung ajar as cold sweat trickled down their foreheads.

How terrifying was this power!

“Senior Sister Ye is so powerful!” The Xuanling Sect disciples were in awe. So this was the ability of an inner sect disciple?

After seeing the damage that Ye Qingtang did with just a light move, Lu Xiuwen’s face darkened to an extreme instantly.

Ye Qingtang actually became this powerful!

How could this be!

Previously, Lu Xiuwen had never witnessed Ye Qingtang’s skills during the inner sect assessment and was very skeptical of Ye Qingtang’s entrance to the inner sect. However, personally seeing everything today, he suddenly realized that the distance between him and Ye Qingtang had unknowingly widened to a point that it was insurmountable.

Even the Blood Moon Sect Elder beside Ye Qingtang could not help but secretly call her a monster after seeing her skills.

It was just a month. How exactly did this girl improve so quickly?!

The skills of the current Ye Qingtang and when she was taking the inner sect assessment was also a world of differences.

In reality, Ye Qingtang’s skills improved by a large extent in this one month since entering the inner sect.

The upgrading of her spirit root and the rich spirit energy in the inner sect allowed her skills to improve rapidly.

Now, she had already surpassed Connate Level Nine and entered Martial Qi Level One—a completely unimaginable presence to the outer sect disciples.

“If you’re unwilling, any one of you can come forward to receive one move from me. If you can withstand it, this matter can be settled.” Ye Qingtang smiled at the Wind Sword Sect disciples who were all a miserable shade of white while uttering something that threw them into utter despair.

All color was drained from the Wind Sword Sect disciples’ faces.

Who the hell would be able to withstand one move from her?!

Was this not seeking death!

Then, no matter how unwilling they were, they could only submit.

The group of Wind Sword Sect disciples handed the Elegant Moon Pills over gloomily.

After collecting over thirty bottles of Elegant Moon Pill, Ye Qingtang was slightly more satisfied. “You all can scram now.”

The Wind Sword Sect disciples did not dare to hang around any longer and fled off hurriedly.

Watching them leave, Qiao Mo and the rest felt that their anger was avenged satisfyingly.

“Thank you, Senior Sister Ye. If not for you today, we would have been humiliated by them.” Tears filled the Xuanling Sect disciples’ eyes.

It was only when they saw an inner sect disciple from their sect during a crisis and were saved from misery did it occur to them how precious their clothes that symbolized Xuanling Sect disciple were.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m
