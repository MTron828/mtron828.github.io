Chapter 571 Hell of Avicinaraka (2)

Although ordinary sects could not be compared to the super sects of Formidable Heavens Dynasty and Nine Nights Dynasty, it would be difficult if they wished

to leave this place alive after entering this Hundred Level Peril hell.

This time, no one knew how many people could leave the Hell of Avicinaraka alive.

In Ye Qingtang’s case, she had already entered the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two and possessed the Ultimate Origin Skill. Her combat skill was similar to that of a disciple at the peak of the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three. Yet despite so, she did not dare to say that she could leave this place alive… Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I’ve heard some things about that Xuanling Patriarch.” The Blood Moon Elder continued on. “Two thousand years ago, the Xuanling Patriarch trained all over the world and rescued a powerful figure who was heavily injured. Afterward, he brought that powerful figure back to his residence to treat her. However, that powerful figure’s body was already extremely dilapidated, and she only had half a heart left… In the end, she died miserably. However, after that powerful figure died, her body turned into a crystal. After another thousand years, the Xuanling Patriarch founded Xuanling Sect and suppressed that crystal within the sect, and that crystal morphed into a small world, which is the mystic realm that we are in…”

Ye Qingtang did not refute him.

Once a cultivator was powerful enough and reached a certain level, a Spiritual Abode would form in his or her body.

Every Spiritual Abode was unique.

In their lifetimes, those powerful figures would store the treasures they obtained in the Spiritual Abode in their bodies. After those powerful figures died, the Spiritual Abodes, however, would not be destroyed.Some of them became mystic realms while others became a dangerous land which was listed as forbidden ground. On the other hand, some Spiritual Abodes turned into blessed Grotto-heavens with countless destinies…

Although the powerful figure that the Xuanling Patriarch rescued back then ultimately died, her Spiritual Abode was not destroyed and turned into a crystal, which was the current Xuanling Sect mystic realm.

In Ye Qingtang’s previous life, a Spiritual Abode was also formed in her body when she was at her peak.

Most of the powerful figures with Spiritual Abodes in their bodies would destroy the Spiritual Abodes if they died a natural death, unwilling to leave their own heritage to be inherited by the future generations.

Only those powerful figures who died tragically due to an unexpected calamity did not have time to destroy the Spiritual Abode in their bodies before their death. Thus, there were numerous accounts of the appearance of a powerful figure’s inheritance in this world.

At this instant, Ye Qingtang was walking to the central square in great strides.

The closer she got, the more intense the smell of blood became.

However, Ye Qingtang’s brows were tightly furrowed as she scanned the surroundings. Apart from the skull of the Lingyun Sect elder hung on the sculpture’s sword, no other corpses could be seen.

“Holy Lady… I can smell that many people died here not long ago… Even the smell of blood is fresh. It’s not more than a day,” the Blood Moon Elder said.

“Not more than a day…” Ye Qingtang’s expression was increasingly heavy.

This place was extremely strange. All of the corpses of those who died had disappeared. Even if they were slaughtered or swallowed by evil spirits, there should still be some flesh and traces left behind.

But observing the area, apart from the skull of a super sect’s elder, nothing else could be seen.

“What exactly happened…” Ye Qingtang’s heart was extremely uneasy.

It was a pity that it was already difficult to regret and leave after entering the mystic realm.

If there was a chance to leave this place now, Ye Qingtang would definitely not hesitate at all and leave instantly.

“Holy Lady, what should we do now?” The Blood Moon Elder was anxious as well.
