Chapter 188: Useless Wolf (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Warden Tu, this is my wolf. It has been in deep sleep for many days and has not woken up. I’ll have to trouble you to take a look at it.” Ye Qingtang pointed at the huge wolf on her bed and said to the over-hundred-year-old senior whom she brought to her room.

Warden Tu touched his beard and examined the wolf on the bed with narrowed eyes. “Are you certain it did not sustain any external injuries?”

Warden Tu was responsible for medical aspects in Xuanling Sect’s outer sect. If any outer sect disciple was sick, he was always asked to help. Occasionally, some disciples with combat pets would find him for help as well, and Warden Tu was already used to such things.

“I’ve checked many times on the way and did not see any injuries on its body,” Ye Qingtang said.

Warden Tu nodded thoughtfully and stepped forward to examine the silver wolf’s condition, but his expression became a little weird after this check.

“Little girl, are you really intending to raise this wolf?” Warden Tu looked at Ye Qingtang as though he wanted to say something more.

“Is there any problem?” Ye Qingtang was a little puzzled.

Warden Tu sighed. “There isn’t any problem, but… although this wolf of yours looks pretty good, it is at most an ordinary wolf breed and not a spirit animal. Even if you spend all your energy to raise it well, it would probably not be a good combat pet and at most a useless wolf.”

Although this wolf’s fur was very nice, Warden Tu felt that this was an ordinary wolf, and there was nothing special about it no matter how he saw it.

The certain wolf with tightly-shut eyes suddenly let out a dangerous aura upon hearing the words “useless wolf.”

However, Ye Qingtang and Warden Tu were in a conversation and did not notice it.

“Warden Tu, I just like it. No matter what it is, I have decided to raise it. Please help me to look at what to do,” Ye Qingtang was strangely firm. Useless or not, it was still her wolf, and there was no use even if others said anything. She would raise it!

Ye Qingtang did not notice that her firm words caused that silver wolf’s dangerous aura to vanish into thin air immediately as it laid even more securely on the bed.

Warden Tu sighed. Honestly speaking, he was in disapproval of Xuanling Sect disciples raising such an ordinary wolf as a combat pet. Combat pets had to be raised carefully for them to turn out well and strong, and most of them were raised from young. However, not only did Ye Qingtang pick up a grown wolf on the road, the wolf was such an ordinary breed. This was really…

“Whatever. I will help you to take a good look, but I have to inform you first it might not recover immediately given that it has been unconscious for several days. There’s even a chance of it being in this state forever…” Then, the warden stretched out his hand helplessly wanting to properly examine the wolf’s condition.

But just when Warden Tu was about to touch it, its tightly-shut eyes suddenly opened. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

A pair of dark green orbs directly met with Warden Tu’s casual eyes.

This look almost scared Warden Tu to death.

Why did this wolf suddenly wake up?!

Ye Qingtang saw that the silver wolf was suddenly awake, and a smile immediately broke out on her face. In her happiness, she instinctively wanted to stretch out her hands to touch the wolf’s fur, but she was suddenly met with those dark green orbs.

Wolves were extremely defensive animals and very aggressive. While Ye Qingtang hugged this wolf for many days, it had always been sleeping. Right now, she was still a stranger to it.
