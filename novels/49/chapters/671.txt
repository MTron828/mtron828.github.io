Ye Qingtang’s head ached a little as she looked at the little white tiger which went back to sleep, not understanding what happened to the Fiendcelestial Beast again.

“Mother~ Do you miss me~” The little dragon man looked up at Ye Qingtang. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“…” Wasn’t it nested in her arms all day? Did she still need to miss it?

Making contact with the little dragon man’s big, bright eyes, Ye Qingtang could only nod helplessly. She really did not understand why this little fellow was so glued to her.

“It’s late. Let’s rest early.” Ye Qingtang patted the little dragon man’s head. She woke up in the middle of her sleep and was still a little tired. Moreover, she still had to hit the road the next morning and thus needed to be fully rested.

The little dragon man nodded in satisfaction. As Ye Qingtang laid down, the little dragon man snuggled next to her obediently. Right before it closed its eyes, it discreetly swept a glance at the little white tiger which was sleeping not far away…

The next morning when Ye Qingtang and the rest woke up, the little black ball had already returned into Ye Qingtang’s body while the little lightning dragon, which was once again “sucked dry,” wilted.

It would never believe anything that little bully said again!

“Holy Lady, where are we going next?” the Blood Moon Elder asked Ye Qingtang.

“I’ll send you home,” Ye Qingtang said with a smile.

“Ah? Home? Are we returning to the Blood Moon Sect?”The Blood Moon Elder’s eyes lit up immediately.

However, Ye Qingtang’s next words utterly kicked the Blood Moon Elder out from his delusions.

“Accurately speaking, it’s sending you back to Ouyang Qian’s home.” Ye Qingtang scanned the Blood Moon Elder with a grin.

Ye Qingtang already had a plan in mind. There were orders to kill her everywhere in Formidable Heavens Dynasty now, and it would be inconvenient for her to return. On the other hand, this mystic realm was not far away from the Nine Nights Dynasty. If they went to the Nine Nights Dynasty, it would be more convenient.

There were only a few months left for Xuanling Sect’s defense, and she had to reach the true Yin Yang Perfected Lord state in this period of time in order to save the entire Xuanling Sect. To break through to the Yin Yang Perfected Lord in such a short span of time, she could only head to Falling Sky Valley.

Furthermore…

Ye Qingtang retrieved a tiny jade pendant from her space ring.

This space ring was given to her by her foster father, who made it clear that it was found on her when they picked her up, and it was probably related to her parentage.

The origin of this jade pendant was related to the royals of the Nine Nights Dynasty.

Regardless of becoming more powerful or tracing her parentage, Ye Qingtang had to head to the Nine Nights Dynasty and Falling Sky Valley.

“Holy Lady, do I really have to go to the Ouyang family?” Despair was seen on the Blood Moon Elder’s face. Let alone that he was already forced to become a female, his Holy Lady still wanted to send him to the Ouyang family to be someone’s daughter… In his entire life… he had never experienced such torture before!

When he thought that he might have to call the Ouyang Family Clan Master “father,” disgust filled him.

“Not only do you have to go there, but you also have to use Ouyang family clan’s influence to help me check something,” Ye Qingtang said.

“What is it?” The Blood Moon Elder asked.

Ye Qingtang held the jade pendant in front of the Blood Moon Elder. “Look at this jade pendant clearly. It’s said that this jade pendant is related to the royals of the Nine Nights Dynasty. When you’ve returned to the Ouyang family clan, help me find out about it.”

The Ouyang family clan was a super family clan in the Nine Nights Dynasty. Given their position and influence, they could definitely find out about secrets that ordinary people could not.
