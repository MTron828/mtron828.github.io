“What a coincidence!” Jiang Yisheng was stunned when he saw who Ye Qingtang’s opponent was.

Jiang Shaobai’s eyes narrowed.

On the side, Jiang Yiran looked shocked. He glanced at Mu Ruxue and Ye Qingtang, and could not help but look worried.

“Ye Qingtang, why don’t you... just admit defeat?” Jiang Yiran was silent for a moment before he finally spoke with some difficulty.

Jiang Yiran was not trying to mock Ye Qingtang when he asked her to admit defeat. He was sincerely concerned for her.

Jiang Yiran was already vexed that his jesting words had offended that lunatic, Mu Ruxue. He had already dragged Jiang Yanyun into the mess. Now he hoped that Ye Qingtang would not be hurt by his mischief.

In the earlier round, Mu Ruxue had tried to kill him. Now Ye Qingtang was fighting her instead. Given Mu Ruxue’s vindictive nature, she certainly would not miss the chance to kill Ye Qingtang in the arena.

“This is all my fault for having such a big mouth. Ye Qingtang, I’m not trying to put you down, but Mu Ruxue is really too powerful. Even I am no match for her. Now she sees you as a thorn in her flesh. If you enter the arena, she will use some vicious tactic on you.” Jiang Yiran was truly frantic.

Although he had continually said that he wanted to fight Ye Qingtang, after getting along with each other for so long, he rather liked this silent little girl. It was just that he could not help but make a few mean comments to tease her once in a while.

It was not just Jiang Yiran. Even the usually stubborn Jiang Yisheng was nodding in agreement.

“Qingtang, I think you should just forget it,” Jiang Yisheng said.

Ye Qingtang looked expressionlessly at the smug-looking Mu Ruxue.

Jiang Yiran was terrified that Ye Qingtang had been infected with Jiang Yisheng’s stubbornness. When he saw that she did not reply, he panicked further.

“Ye Qingtang, are you afraid?” Mu Ruxue walked through the crowd, straight towards them. Behind her were a few youths from the Mu family. Her face had a mocking smile.

Almost subconsciously, Jiang Yiran stood in front of Ye Qingtang, afraid that Mu Ruxue would hurt the latter. Now he was truly feeling guilty. He wished he could slap himself and stop himself from spouting so much nonsense.

“Loser. Get lost.” Mu Ruxue did not disguise her contempt when she saw Jiang Yiran. She only glanced at him, then looked straight at Ye Qingtang.

“I am your opponent today. Ye Qingtang, I did not expect us to be destined to fight each other.”

“So it’s destiny...” Ye Qingtang said calmly, her expression calm and unreadable.

“Mu Ruxue, what do you want?!” Jiang Yisheng stepped forward boldly and shouted at her.

“Is everyone in the Jiang family such a coward? I’m just here to greet my next opponent. Why are all of you in such a frenzy? Perhaps...”

A contemptuous look of scorn swept over Ye Qingtang as Mu Ruxue laughed softly. “You think she’s no match for me? Ah... No, you don’t just think so. It’s a fact. Ye Qingtang got here by luck after all. What kind of true abilities can she possess? You Jiangs are so pathetic... we’re not yet at the finals, but there are only three of you left. Are you really the descendants of the Domain Monarch’s family? Others really question whether it is the case.”

Her words seemed to drip with poison. Every word hit at the Jiang family youths’ sore spots akin to sprinkling salt on open wounds.
