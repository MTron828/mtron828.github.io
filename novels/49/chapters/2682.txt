Chapter 2683 Fourth Domain (3)

Furthermore, the most important thing was that in the Great Immortal Temple, be they righteous or evil cultivators, they were all very easy to get along with. They were like family. If she had encountered unreasonable and overbearing people who liked to use their own strength to bully their fellow disciples, Ye Qingtang would definitely not treat them so respectfully.

“Alright, Xie Jun, don’t bully your Junior Sister Ye Yue.” The Absolute Heaven Saint glanced at Xie Jun. “Your Junior Sister Ye Yue’s skin is very thin, not as thick as yours.”

Xie Jun chuckled and shook his head. “Master, you are being biased. How is Junior Sister Ye Yue’s skin thin? It’s just that my skin is extra thick.”

Ye Qingtang could not help chuckling as she watched the conversation between Xie Jun and the Absolute Heaven Saint.

It was like this in the Great Immortal Temple. The relationship between a master and a disciple was like that of a father and child. There was no need to worry about saying only the appropriate things. No one bothered about these things.

As a disciple, it was extremely easy for Ye Qingtang to stay in the Great Immortal Temple to cultivate. She did not have any worries.

In this era, sects had not risen to prominence yet. There was no disparity in the status between disciples and the upper echelons of a sect. There was also none of the extremely formal and impersonal environment of an academy.

“Junior Sister Ye Yue, why are you smiling when you see me being reprimanded by my master? Do you also think that I am shameless?” Xie Jun was taken aback to see Ye Qingtang laughing.

“No.” Ye Qingtang shook her head. “I just think that your martial art skills and talent are better than mine. But Uncle-Master treats you like his own son, so he is purposely needling you.”

Xie Jun shook his head and said with a smile, “Junior Sister Ye Yue is indeed humble. In terms of current strength, I am indeed stronger than you, but your martial arts talent and potential is indeed higher than mine. In just a few short years, without even taking advantage of the resources of the Great Immortal Temple and just relying on cultivation in seclusion, your level advanced from the sub-Emperor stage to the Illusory Emperor stage. This speed is far beyond what I can achieve.”

Xie Jun’s martial art talent was already very high. It took him a total of six years to advance from the sub-Emperor stage to the Illusory Emperor level.

However, Ye Qingtang was different. Everyone witnessed her growth in the Great Immortal Temple. In less than three years, she completed the ascension onto the Illusory Emperor stage. The time she took was only half of that of Xie Jun.

“Senior Brother Xie Jun, I was just lucky…” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“Junior Sister Ye Yue, it’s a good thing to be humble, but… there’s no need to be excessively humble. You can be humble with us, but not with outsiders. You should suppress them ruthlessly…” Xie Jun said.

“Alright now.” The Absolute Heaven Saint glanced frowned at Xie Jun. “Don’t teach your Junior Sister Ye Yue the wrong things.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Master, I am not teaching Junior Sister Ye Yue anything wrong. I’m just afraid that with Junior Sister Ye Yue’s personality, she will suffer when she encounters outsiders in the future.” Xie Jun smiled nonchalantly at the Absolute Heaven Saint’s reprimand.

“Stand aside and listen quietly,” said the Absolute Heaven Saint.

After the Xie Jun settled down, the Absolute Heaven Saint continued, “The void rift has loosened quite a bit. I’ll be able to send you guys to the legacy realm by tomorrow, at the latest. Xie Jun, remember that you have to obey Junior Sister Ye’s orders.”
