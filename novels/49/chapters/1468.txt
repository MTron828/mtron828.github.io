1469 The Familial Tradition of Protection 2

“I am bent on being nosy.” Jiang Xun snickered.

“Don’t blame me for being impolite then.” There was a movement of air in Jiang Kai’s palm as though he wanted to make a move personally.

Jiang Xun’s lips curled into a snicker

“I haven’t exchanged blows with Eldest Brother for a long time already. Today is a chance to move my bones.”

Seeing that Jiang Xun and Jiang Kai were about to fight, Elder Xu was very vexed.

Although he did not know what happened, he faintly felt that this was related to Ye You and Ye Qingtang.

If Jiang Xun and Jiang Kai fought…

Boom!

A loud sound almost pierced through everyone’s eardrums, and Jiang Xun and Jiang Kai halted because of that sound as well.

A golden light suddenly spread out from the mountain behind the Jiang Residence, and everyone was shaken by that golden light.

“Is the Domain Monarch out of seclusion?” An expression of delight suddenly appeared on Elder Xu’s face when he saw that golden light.

The golden light stretched across the horizon and gathered into a figure, which landed in the Jiang Residence.

With a blaring bang, that figure landed in the disorderly courtyard instantly.

The people in the courtyard kneeled down and greeted the golden figure.

“Greetings, Domain Monarch.”

In the encirclement of the golden light, the tall and handsome Domain Monarch looked at the people without any emotions as he glanced at the wrecked courtyard.

“Why are you all making a ruckus here?” Domain Monarch asked in a deep tone.

Even Jiang Xun and Jiang Kai were more restrained in front of the Domain Monarch now.

In the Jiang Family, no one could sway the dignity of the Domain Monarch.

Elder Xu heaved a sigh of relief when he saw the Domain Monarch and immediately notified him of what happened previously.

Ye Qingtang was slightly shaken when she saw the Domain Monarch’s figure.

Although she had heard of the Domain Monarch in her previous lifetime, she had not seen him before. Just by seeing him there now, she already felt a powerful repressive force. This was just released by him unintentionally and was greatly repressed. Had he not repressed it, the power of this force would be unfathomable.

The Domain Monarch frowned slightly when he heard Elder Xu, and he glanced at Jiang Lang.

Ye Qingtang could not help but break out in a cold sweat as she did not know what Domain Monarch’s attitude toward this incident was.

“Domain Monarch, Jiang Lang violated the family rules repeatedly. It is truly abominable,” Elder Meng said.

Jiang Xun scoffed. “Violated the family rules repeatedly? Why do you say so, Elder Meng? This beginning cause of this incident is Ye You. If Ye You did not steal Ye Qingtang’s spirit root, how would things become this state?”

Jiang Xun did not know the cause previously but learned from Elder Xu that Ye You stole Ye Qingtang’s spirit root.

“This happened when the two of them were in another clan. Furthermore, it was Ye You’s grandfather who did it, and it has nothing to do with Ye You. Yet, Mo Yi injured Yiming in the Jiang Family, violating the rules deliberately. She is doubly guilty.” Elder Meng would definitely not let go of this chance.

“If someone did not have a guilty conscience and incited Jiang Yiming to stir trouble, how would things become this way?” Jiang Xun snickered.

“Shut up,” said the Domain Monarch in a low tone.

Everyone kept quiet immediately.

No one dared to rebel before the Domain Monarch.

The Domain Monarch’s expression remained the same, but his eyes suddenly looked toward the entrance of the courtyard.

Ye You and Ye Xun, who had been hiding in a corner, entered the Domain Monarch’s sight and were stricken with panic when they noticed the Domain Monarch’s gaze.

Ye You hurriedly calmed down before walking toward the Domain Monarch obediently and kneeling down gently. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Grandfather…”

Ye You returned to the Jiang Family a long time ago and met the Domain Monarch once before he went into seclusion.
