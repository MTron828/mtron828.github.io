Chapter 56: Conspiracy (2)

Ye Ling stared, wide-eyed, at the seemingly demure Ye Xun.

Never in his wildest dreams did he expect that the daughter whom he had adopted and raised would turn out to be a heartless fiend.

“Sir, what Xun-er said is not without merit. As head of the household, the family’s safety is the primary concern. Being soft on such a crime is an act of complacency that will be detrimental to the household’s interest and reputation. In such cases, a head of the household should err on the side of caution…” An Elder from the Duan household voiced his advice as his gaze swept over the grim Ye Ling.

“I’m the family head and the Second Elder is a member of my household. I’m able to make a judgment without others interfering.” Ye Ling coldly replied.

“Uncle Ye, you shouldn’t have said that. We’re all part of the noble families in the same city. Thus, your judgment in this case will affect us as well.” Duan Tianrao warned.

“Shut up. You’re in no position to talk.” Ye Ling retorted.

Duan Tianrao furrowed his brow, obviously displeased over the curt remark.

The Great Elder came forward and said: “Sir, I’m afraid you’re still traumatized over yesterday’s incident, clouding your judgment. I reckon you should get an early rest. I’ll take things over from here. No worries, if we cooperate, I’m sure we can work things out.”

With that said, he exchanged glances with the Elders from the Duan household. They were assembled at the Great Elder’s behest and had intended to deal with the Second Elder since the beginning. Now that the signal was given, they attacked straight away!

The Second Elder bore a solemn and fearless countenance as he engaged those Elders head-on.

Though Ye Ling did not expect the Great Elder to start a fight so blatantly, he was prepared to fight alongside the Second Elder. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Father, you shouldn’t exert yourself when you’re not feeling well recently. With the Great Elder’s assistance, I’m sure this matter will be in good hands.” Ye Xun cut-in and stopped Ye Ling in his tracks before he could interfere.

“Get lost. You’re no daughter of mine.” Ye Ling bellowed and wanted to shove her out of his way.

Duan Tianrao stepped in at this moment and while protecting Ye Xun with one arm around her, he blocked Ye Ling with the other and said:” Uncle Ye, Xun-er’s doing this for your own good. Its dangerous to be involved in that scuffle. No one wants to see you getting hurt.”

“Get lost! This is none of your business!” Ye Ling warned.

Duan Tianrao remained adamant without budging an inch, “Uncle Ye, you’re far too soft for a head of the household. The Great Elder had thus volunteered to act on your behalf. Why’re you so uncompromising? For your own safety, you’ve left me no choice but to keep you in check.”

Ye Ling contorted his face in frustration and attacked Duan Tianrao instantly!

Duan Tianrao sneered at Ye Ling in his mind.

If Ye Ling was still in his prime, he might be a worthy opponent. However, his health and strength had deteriorated in these recent years and was no longer a challenge. What’s there to be wary of?

Duan Tianrao began engaging Ye Ling one on one.

Ye Xun had a worried look on her face as she watched their duel from a side, “Father, Duan-lang! Please stop fighting!” She voiced her anxiety while she tried to stop their duel, though discreetly, she had been interjecting between Ye Ling’s blows, putting him at a further disadvantage.

On the other hand, the fight between the Elders from the Duan household and the Second Elder had remained at a stalemate. Although the Second Elder was formidable, his victory was impeded by the higher number of opponents. When he noticed Duan Tianrao and Ye Xun joining hands against Ye Ling, he became distracted in the heat of the moment. The cunning Great Elder caught onto his momentary weakness, and with a single leap, he managed to get behind the Second Elder and land a fatal blow on his back.
