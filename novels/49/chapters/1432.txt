After sunset, Ye Qingtang ate some things and regained her energy. She went to look for Beidou Demon Lord but found that he was already snoring away on the ground.

Once she walked to the courtyard and wanted to return to her room, a figure suddenly appeared before her.

It was an aloof lady who exuded an overbearing demeanor. Her long eyes narrowed slightly and swept across Ye Qingtang sharply.

Ye You slowly walked out from behind that lady.

When Ye Qingtang saw Ye You, she immediately realized something.

“You, is she Ye Qingtang?” Jiang Qin cast a look of disdain at Ye Qingtang and subsequently turned to look at Ye You affectionately.

“Yes, Aunt Qin.” Ye You nodded obediently, though there was a trace of a sneer hidden in the depth of her eyes.

Jiang Qin had always been a tough and straightforward person, and she had an extremely high position in the Jiang Family. So what if Ye Qingtang was a child of the Jiang Family?

If she upset Jiang Qin, she naturally would not receive good treatment.

Jiang Qin nodded lightly and then looked at Ye Qingtang coldly.

“You. Come here.”

Ye Qingtang looked at the unfriendly Ye You and Jiang Qin and stepped forward slowly.

Jiang Qin looked at Ye Qingtang indifferently and said, “You are back in the Jiang Family now. I don’t care how ill-disciplined you are outside, but in the Jiang Family, you must follow the Jiang Family’s rules. You is older than you and is your sister, but you were disrespectful to her and contradicted her. I want you to kneel down and kowtow to apologize to You.”

Jiang Qin had a haughty manner and did not have any respect for Ye Qingtang.

Looking at the assertive Jiang Qin, a trace of a smile emerged in Ye You’s eyes as she looked at Ye Qingtang provocatively while standing behind Jiang Qin.

Ye Qingtang did not move an inch as though she did not hear Jiang Qin’s orders.

“I want you to kneel down. Don’t you hear me? What an ill-disciplined, wild girl.” Jiang Qin narrowed her eyes, and a powerful repressive force spread out from her.

Under the force, Ye Qingtang had difficulty breathing.

Jiang Qin’s skills were actually above Heavenly Venerate Fifth Heaven!

In no time, Ye Qingtang broke out in a cold sweat, but her legs remained standing stably without bending at all.

“You want me to kneel to her? On what basis?” Ye Qingtang snickered while forcefully resisting the force.

“I want you to kneel, so you must kneel.” Jiang Qin sneered as her repressive force strengthened suddenly.

Ye Qingtang turned pale immediately.

At this very instant, she clearly realized that even though her skills increased rapidly, it was still insufficient in the Central Mainland, where highly-skilled people were everywhere.

She must become more powerful as quickly as possible! RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Ye You looked at the pale Ye Qingtang proudly with viciousness filled in her eyes.

“Since you are unwilling to kneel, I will break your legs. Let me see if you are going to kneel or not.” Jiang Qin snickered coldly as a light shot out from her palm and straight at Ye Qingtang’s knees!

However, at this moment, a red beam suddenly appeared and blocked Jiang Qin’s attack.

The next second the red beam appeared, Elder Xu landed behind Ye Qingtang and supported her collapsing body.

“Jiang Qin, what are you doing!” Jiang Liu, who came over together, looked at Jiang Qin with a flabbergasted expression.
