Jiang Xun was wondering where the little white tiger, which Ye Qingtang always carried in her arms, had gone to.“With Ye Qingtang’s ability, she couldn’t possibly have gotten far. Spread out and search for her. I must have her head today,” Jiang Qin said with a cold laugh.

“But Aunt Qin, hasn’t the powerful cultivator from the Second Domain already gone to look for Ye Qingtang? Why don’t we quietly await developments?” Someone suggested.

But Jiang Qin glared coldly at him. “Didn’t you understand what I said? I want Ye Qingtang dead. The Land of Infinite Demons is so large. If the powerful cultivator from the Second Domain cannot find her, won’t she be able to escape?”

Everyone finally nodded in comprehension. They divided into groups and continued to search.

While everyone was searching for Ye Qingtang, Ye Qingtang had already flown several miles away.

“F*ck, those Jiang Family members were really up to no good.” The little white tiger in Ye Qingtang’s arms cursed softly.

Ye Qingtang and Jiang Xun had just left the main hall when the little white tiger sensed many auras pursuing them, and so it warned Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang knew from Jiang Lang and his wife that Jiang Xun could create illusions. After a hurried discussion with Jiang Xun, she allowed Jiang Xun to use spirit energy to create an illusion that looked like her, to follow Jiang Xun.

Then, even if the Jiang Family caught them, they would not dare to do anything to Jiang Xun. She herself could seize the opportunity to sneak away.

“This time, they brought me to the Land of Infinite Demons in order to get rid of me.” Ye Qingtang laughed softly. She was fully prepared for Jiang Qin and the others.

Perhaps she could continue to depend on Jiang Xun, but now, Jiang Xun was injured, and Jiang Shangyu had no intention of protecting Jiang Xun. Ye Qingtang was afraid that Jiang Shun and the others would kill Jiang Xun if they were forced to do so.

Thus, Ye Qingtang had chosen to do things this way—firstly as a delaying tactic, and secondly to avoid involving Jiang Xun.

The Land of Infinite Demons was incredibly vast, and it would be no easy matter for someone to catch her.

Although Ye Qingtang was prepared, she did not let her guard down. She flew swiftly with the little white tiger, hoping to get as far away from danger as possible.

But before she had gotten far, she sensed a strong oppressive force floating about her head. Ye Qingtang hurriedly looked up at the void and saw that the old man from the Second Domain, who had accompanied the green-robed girl, flying a short distance behind her.

“...”

What the hell!

Ye Qingtang had not expected the old man from the Second Domain to chase after her.

He must have greatly resented not being able to obtain the two Dharma treasures.

Ye Qingtang’s earlier plan was to distract the group from the Jiang Family. She did not expect that this even more powerful fellow would be so desperate to want her life.

Her expression darkened, and she quickly scanned the mountains and the forest.

Boom! A blinding beam of light suddenly fell from the sky and charged towards Ye Qingtang. Ye Qingtang flew aside, narrowly avoiding this deadly strike.

“I would like to see how the Purple Palace can protect you now that you have left the palace.” The old man looked disdainfully at Ye Qingtang from his vantage point.

How dare an insect from the Eight Heaven of Arcane Supremacy embarrass him!

Today, he would make her long for death.

Cold sweat popped up on Ye Qingtang’s forehead. From the side of her eyes, she secretly scanned her surroundings for something.
