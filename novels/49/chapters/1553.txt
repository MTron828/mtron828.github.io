1554 Taiyuan Valley 1

Although Ye Qingtang did not know who was fighting at the stream, she knew they must be the supremely talented members of the Jiang Family who were being trained by the Elder Cabinet. She could gauge their talent from the power displayed in the dragon aura.

Jiang Qi was used to all this. He just glanced at it and then continued leading Ye Qingtang towards her living quarters.

Only the Jiang Family lived in Taiyuan Valley. Besides the Inner Sect Elders of the Elder Cabinet, the rest were the top talents of the Jiang Family. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Youths like Jiang Qi and the others were brought to Taiyuan Valley when they were very young. They were separated from their parents and received the best training from the Jiang Family. They were carefully nurtured from the time of their birth and seldom left the valley.

Perhaps no one in Central Mainland knew about them, but when they left the valley and displayed their skills, they would amaze everyone.

Actually, all the great families in Central Mainland carefully nurtured the best talents of the next generation, and this was not unique to the Jiang Family. On the other hand, those with mediocre talents would remain in the family clan. Although they might win fame, they would have to stand aside once the highly talented members of their generation emerged.

Like Jiang Yiming of the Jiang Family...

“Elder Brother Qi, have you returned?”

Jiang Qi had just brought Ye Qingtang to the living quarters when a petite young girl, about eleven or twelve years of age, approached them while batting her eyes.

The young girl was very good-looking, and she had a pair of large, expressive eyes. A smile lurked in the corners of her mouth, and her eyes crinkled in amusement. She looked extremely likable.

Jiang Qi nodded his head slightly when he saw the girl. The girl’s eyes involuntarily fell on Ye Qingtang, and an inquisitive look surfaced in her eyes.

“Who is this?”

“Ye Qingtang, also a member of the Jiang Family,” Jiang Qi said blandly.

A trace of surprise flashed across the girl’s eyes. She was apparently well-versed with the rules of the Elder Cabinet and did not expect a sixteen-or seventeen-year-old Jiang Family member to enter the cabinet. However, she quickly regained her composure. She walked smilingly over to Jiang Qi and placed her hands on his arms in a familiar gesture.

“Elder Brother Qi, was the Land of Infinite Demons fun? Was there really a big demon? Did you see it?” The girl’s eyes were filled with curiosity.

Jiang Qi’s face did not show much expression. He only replied simply and showed no sign of elaborating.

“If you need me, you can look for me,” Jiang Qi said to Ye Qingtang and then left.

The young girl’s room was next to Ye Qingtang’s room. When she saw that Jiang Qi had left, she looked at Ye Qingtang with wide eyes and gave her a sweet smile.

“You’re older than me. Why don’t I call you Elder Sister Qing in the future?”

“...Elder Sister... Qing?” Ye Qingtang puzzled over this term and did not know whether to cry or to laugh. However, this young girl was so likable that she simply smiled and nodded her head without saying anything.

“Elder Sister Qing, I’m Jiang Shaobai. I live next door to you. Brother Qi is usually busy. If you have any questions, you can look for me,” Jiang Shaobai said smilingly. The two dimples in her cheeks looked especially sweet when she smiled.

“Alright.” Ye Qingtang nodded. Compared to Jiang Yiming and Ye You in the Jiang house, Ye Qingtang felt that the younger Jiangs in Taiyuan Valley were much friendlier.

Jiang Shaobai said a few more words to Ye Qingtang, then waved, and let Ye Qingtang go about her business.

After she saw Ye Qingtang enter her room, the smile on Jiang Shaobai’s little face immediately disappeared. She turned and instantly vanished on the spot.
