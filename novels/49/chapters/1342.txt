Chapter 1343 Ancient You Clan 3

The Ancient You Clan Elder frowned slightly and said, “The Ancient You Clan has always been extremely respectful toward the Temple of Shadows. Ling Yan is an evil man. Why would you dispute with the Ancient You Clan over a Ling Yan, Holy Lord of Shadows?”

Ye Qingtang looked at the Ancient You Clan through the veil in the Black Bone Carriage, though there was a trace of nervousness on her face.

She never thought that she would confront the Ancient You Clan so quickly, but fortunately, she was the Holy Lord of Shadows now.

While Ling Yan…

She must protect him. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Furthermore…

Given the Holy Lord of Shadows’s personality and skills, she would not fear the Ancient You Clan at all.

“Dispute? Is the Ancient You Clan even fit for me to dispute?” Ye Qingtang inhaled deeply and said in a cold tone.

The three Skeletal Dragons seemed to have sensed Ye Qingtang’s forceful attitude and suddenly roared thunderously. The eight giant demonic beasts from the Ancient You Clan let out a screeching howl simultaneously.

Deafening sounds filled the air in a moment!

The Ancient You Clan Elder’s face darkened.

“So, do you mean that you will protect Ling Yan regardless, Holy Lord?”

Ye Qingtang did not respond, but her attitude showed her clear stand.

The Ancient You Clan Elder had a dark expression. They were here today to deal with Ling Yan only; thus, only an Elder, that was him, came. Although there were a number of other Ancient You Clan members, their skills were not the best.

On the Temple of Shadows’s side, the two Holy Sons and even the Holy Lord of Shadows who had disappeared for a long time were present.

If they went against the Temple of Shadows now, they would be at a disadvantage.

It was definitely not the Ancient You Clan Elder’s wish to stir up so much trouble over one Ling Yan. Perhaps the Ancient You Clan was not afraid of confronting the Temple of Shadows, but it was not worth it.

Furthermore…

If they fought, they were definitely not the opponents of the Temple of Shadows’s Holy Sons and Holy Lord and would all die here.

After balancing his options, the Ancient You Clan Elder immediately said, “I can’t say anything else since you are so insistent.”

Afterward, the Ancient You Clan Elder walked straight back to the golden carriage. The moment the carriage door closed, the Ancient You Clan people set off and returned gradually.

Looking at the Ancient You Clan’s departure, Ye Qingtang sighed in relief in the Black Bone Carriage.

If they really fought, she might expose her identity…

Luckily, they left.

Ye Qingtang had to thank the fact that she was inside the Black Bone Carriage all along, which helped her to remain calm. Otherwise, if she confronted the Ancient You Clan Elder face to face, she might make mistakes under pressure.

Ye Qingtang was currently covered in a cold sweat. Confronting the Ancient You Clan forces in the Central Mainland for the first time was a torturous feeling.

The more she felt that way, the more she realized that she had to clutch onto the weapon that was the Temple of Shadows.

Otherwise, with just herself, going against the entire Ancient You Clan within a short span of time was simply a useless thought.

“Thank you for your help today, Holy Lord. I am extremely grateful,” Ling Yan said with a smile outside the Black Bone Carriage.

Ye Qingtang took a look at Ling Yan, who looked the same as usual, and faintly felt that he seemed to have planned everything that happened from the start.

From when Ling Yan poisoned the Ancient You Clan’s drinking water, the events seemed to have developed to Ling Yan’s advantage.

Even her identity as the Holy Lord of Shadows…

A thought suddenly struck Ye Qingtang.

Could it be that Ling Yan also planned for her to become the Holy Lord of Shadows from the start?
