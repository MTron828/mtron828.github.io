“You!” The Dragon-Tiger General glared at Ye Qingtang with wide eyes, wishing he could skin her alive.

“Why? Unwilling?” Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes as a cold glint flashed across her eyes suddenly.

The Dragon-Tiger General did not even have time to react or find out what happened, but he felt an extremely overbearing impact on his face!

In the next second, Ye Qingtang’s fist crashed on the Dragon-Tiger General’s face forcefully.

With just a punch, the Dragon-Tiger General was instantly flung out. His huge body flew for several meters before finally falling on the ground heavily. When he raised his head up, his nose was already completely broken, and blood gushed out of his wounds.

The excruciating pain caused the Dragon-Tiger General, who had been in hundreds of battles, to break out in cold sweat. However, before he could crawl up, a ghost-like figure appeared near him once again.

Ye Qingtang suddenly struck her foot out, kicking the Dragon-Tiger General into the air. He was knocked onto the roof of the black market and crashed down on the ground loudly. He felt as though a giant boulder rolled over his entire body.

The people in the surrounding area were shaken by the sight.

The Dragon-Tiger General relied on his position and authority and the fact that he was a trusted subordinate of the premier Qin Long, to act rashly and domineeringly and even allowed his son to commit murders and many other crimes in the monarch city.

Many were infuriated but did not dare to speak up. However, the tyrannical Dragon-Tiger General was beaten up like a dog in public. This really vented the anger of those who had once been bullied!

No matter how high the Dragon-Tiger General’s position was, his skills were nowhere close to this half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord young man.

He finally had it for him today.

The Dragon-Tiger General was in so much pain that he saw stars. He held himself up with difficulty. He wanted to stand up but suddenly saw the figure that was walking towards him.

“If you don’t kneel, I’ll beat you up until you kneel.” Ye Qingtang looked down coldly at the Dragon-Tiger General who had yet to crawl up as her lips curled into a nightmarish angle.

The Dragon-Tiger General felt that his head was going to explode when he saw Ye Qingtang’s sinister smile.

He had a feeling that this young man definitely meant what he said…

At the thought of his opponent’s horrifying aura, the Dragon-Tiger General’s heart trembled. Just as Ye Qingtang was about to walk to his side, the Dragon-Tiger General directly kneeled before Ye Qingtang!

“I… I’ll kneel… I’ll kneel…” The Dragon-Tiger General was drenched in cold sweat. No matter how thick his flesh wash, how could it withstand the beating of a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord?

If he was beaten up another two times, his life would probably end here.

At this instant, the Dragon-Tiger General could no longer care about his face. Protecting his life was more important!

There were no emotions in Ye Qingtang’s eyes as she looked at the Dragon-Tiger General, who knelt before her in public. She suddenly said, “Look up.”

The Dragon-Tiger General was shaken, but he could only follow Ye Qingtang’s words and look at Ye Qingtang’s face.

“I came here for a stroll today, but my mood was spoiled by you all. What should I do about this matter?” Ye Qingtang said in a cold tone.
