Chapter 994 The Long Family (6)

The Long Family Master’s eyes flashed when he heard Duan Tianrao’s words. For an ordinary outer sect disciple to be so open-handed, it meant that she must have had an amazing encounter!

Not only that, but the Long Family Master also knew from Duan Tianrao that the entire Duan Family, including his father, had been defeated by Ye Qingtang. They had not even been able to fight back.

An ordinary outer sect disciple could not possibly have done that. Even a powerful inner sect disciple of a super sect might not be able to do that!

At that moment, one of the senior members of the Long Family spoke. “It looks like Ye Qingtang really has some amazing treasures on her person. Your Duan Family was defeated by Ye Qingtang because of the mysterious Dharma treasure on her person.”

When he heard that, Duan Tianrao nodded rapidly and said, “That’s right.”

“Haha… how interesting. Our Long Family is truly lucky… If we bring those dozens of premium yellow-grade divine weapons and rare elixirs back to the Long Family, not to mention the Dharma treasure on that girl, our family will certainly be elevated to the next level.”

A trace of excitement surfaced in the eyes of several Long Family elders.

The Long Family Master wanted the divine weapons and Dharma treasures, and he certainly would not pass up on the treasures that Ye Qingtang was carrying.

After taking away all the treasures in the Ye Family, there was no more reason for the Ye Family to exist. If the Ye Family let it be known that his Long Family had obtained so many divine weapons and treasures, another family that could rival the Long Family might find out, and then a conflict would be inevitable.

“Lord Long… your presence is truly an honor for the Ye Family!”

At that moment, all the senior members of the Ye Family were smiling ingratiatingly and looking at the Long Family Master.

“I never imagined that the Ye Family would have so many treasures.” The Long Family Master swept a glance at them and spoke remotely.

When they heard that, all the senior members of the Ye Family looked thoughtful.

“How wonderful that Lord Long likes them… We were intending to present all these divine weapons and treasures to the Long Family. After all, considering our skill level, these divine weapons and Dharma treasures would be wasted on us…”

One of the senior members of the Ye Family said with a smile. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The Long Family Master did not show much expression when he heard that. He only said coldly, “I heard that the Eldest Young Lady of the Ye Family injured the Duan Family Master.”

“This…”

The senior members of the Ye Family exchanged glances.

“Lord Long, our Eldest Young Lady just returned to Lin Town and doesn’t know the rules… she isn’t very sensible and has been a little arrogant ever since she entered the sect to cultivate. However, she had no intention of offending the Long Family!”

“That’s right. We will certainly make Ye Qingtang kneel and kowtow to the Duan Family Master for injuring him. We hope Lord Long will be gracious. We will give all these divine weapons and Dharma treasures to the Long Family…”

A few senior members of the Ye Family spoke hurriedly.

The Duan Family was not important. What was important was the Long Family’s attitude.

An elder from the Long Family immediately laughed coldly and said, “She is merely an ordinary outer sect disciple. Considering the ability and cultivation level of an outer sect disciple, could she really severely injure the Duan Family Master… or do you mean she relied on some Dharma treasure to be able to do so.”

When they heard the Long Family Elder’s words, everyone from the Ye Family also thought that this must be true. In terms of martial arts ability, Ye Qingtang was merely an outer sect disciple, but the Duan Family Master was so powerful. He had already reached the Second Heaven of martial arts cultivation!
