Chapter 71: The Birthday Banquet (8)

“Sure, Miss Ye. Go ahead with whatever needs to be done.” With that said, Mu Su handed Ye Qingtang a note with his current address and added, “In that case, I’ll be on my way.”

“Thank you again, my Lord.”

Mu Su gave a slight nod before he turned around to leave the premises. His task at hand would be to inform His Highness about Ye Qingtang’s upcoming visit.

Mu Su’s departure was as sudden as his arrival, though none of the guests would dare to comment on that. Even after he had left the hall, everyone was still in a daze.

After confirming Mu Su’s departure, Ye Ling finally came to his senses, and together with the Second Elder, they pulled Ye Qingtang to a corner for questioning: “Tang Tang, what was that all about?”

Ye Qingtang watched their anxious faces and she responded with an assuring smile: “Father, Uncle, as you can see, I’ve grown a new spirit root! Though it can’t be compared to my previous one, but that’s still better than nothing. And now, his Lordship has agreed to refer me to Xuan Ling’s clan, isn’t this wonderful news?”

Ye Ling and the Second Elder were rendered speechless by her statement. The re-emergence of her spirit root and getting a chance to join an Exalted Clan were wonderful news indeed.

Although there were still many questions they wanted to ask her, both were aware that this was not the suitable time and place. Thus, they remained quiet.

On the other hand, the Great Elder who had witnessed the entire matter, lost all the joy from his birthday celebration. With a clouded face and a sharp glare, he stared daggers at Ye Qingtang behind her back.

“Grandpa….” Ye Xun approached the Great Elder’s side discreetly, with a complicated look on her face.

“Xun-er, follow me. There’re matters to be discussed.” The Great Elder spoke in a solemn tone and without paying further heed to the guests that were still in the hall, he retired to his study, accompanied by Ye Xun.

The guests saw the Great Elder’s unhappy face before he left, but that was within their expectations.

At first, everyone assumed Mu Su’s visit was a birthday surprise from Ye You, but that turned out to be a huge blunder. Recalling the Great Elder’s enthusiasm back then was quite the comic relief. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Anyone would have a sour face if he or she was in the Great Elder’s shoes now.

The Great Elder was at his worst as he led Ye Xun into his study. Once he closed the doors behind them, he gave an order to Ye Xun: “You’re to make haste to the Cloud-breakers as soon as possible.”

Ye Xun faltered for a moment.

The Great Elder explained: “Everyone in the city will come to know of Ye Qingtang’s acquaintance with Mu Su and it’ll be too risky to get rid of her here. If she even joins Xuan Ling’s clan, she’ll be the bane of Xiao-You’s existence.”

Ye Xun gave a nod as she had more or less caught on to the Great Elder’s intentions.

Ye Qingtang’s original spirit root was stolen by Ye You. If this rumor was to make its way around, Ye You’s reputation would be tarnished.

“Grandpa, you want me to inform Sis about this?”

“That’s right.” The Great Elder nodded and added: “I’ll order the men to escort you there quickly, once you’ve met her, you’re to inform her of the details. Given her status, she’s in a much better position to deal with that Ye Qingtang for now.”

“Noted, Grandpa. I’ll carry out your order without fail.” Ye Xun curtsied meekly, though she had other plans in her mind.

Duan Tianrao had already shown his displeasure with her, and if Ye Qingtang really managed to join an Exalted Clan, he would definitely hold a deeper grudge against her. Her plan to become the First Lady of the Duan household would be foiled then.

However, if Ye Qingtang was to meet with a sudden death during her training, that would surely erase all lingering desires he had towards her.

Since no one would care to flog a dead horse.
