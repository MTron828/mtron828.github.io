Chapter 832 The Start of The Great Era: Vying for Supremacy

The Central Mainland was extremely vast, and it was almost a thousand times larger than this mainland. It had a total of eight dynasties, and each dynasty ruled 20 countries out of a total of 160 countries.

The supposed extremely-powerful Central Dynasty was merely one out of the eight dynasties and was not even considered as the top dynasty among the eight dynasties.

The Central Mainland was the best mainland in this domain. Apart from its almost-endless territory and booming martial culture, it also had countless terrifying hidden clans, and all of the best were gathered there.

Every dynasty had an Honor Roll List which recorded the names of the dynasty’s powerful youngsters at present age.

For example, Yin Yang Boy was from the Eternal Dynasty and was one of the superhuman prodigies on the Honor Roll List. He was still young, but his martial skills had already entered the Arcane Supremacy realm. Apart from his title as the Yin Yang Boy, he also possessed the honorific of a Yin Yang Supremacy.

Swoosh!

In the next second, the Yin Yang Boy’s tiny-looking body transformed into a bolt of light and disappeared instantly.

“Hah… I really never expected that it’d be our Eternal Dynasty to take the first step into this place.” A young man mounted on a flying spirit animal chuckled and vanished without a trace.

“Beast Tamer, Tian Zui?”

The muscular man frowned slightly upon seeing that young man. That Tian Zui was a Beast Tamer who was true to his name. Although he appeared to be a young man, he was at least 100 years old…

“Damn it. So many talents came. It is really not definite whether I can pick up any bargains in this trip to the Dragon Vein.” The muscular man mumbled.

An increasing number of talents appeared that day and flew towards the Dragon Vein.

At a valley, the silver wolf gradually stopped under Ye Qingtang’s signal.

Ye Qingtang got off the silver wolf’s back quickly and was in thought as she looked at the streaks of light in the sky that disappeared with a flash.

Master Du witnessed the sight as well, and his expression was rather solemn.

“Could it be that…” Master Du spoke with a frown.

“Powerful figures from other mainlands entered this mainland,” Ye Qingtang said.

After a portion of the Dimension Wall was broken by Ning Luo, anyone who found the crack in the Dimension Wall could easily enter.

“Those people…”

Some of those faces were not exactly foreign to Ye Qingtang. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

In her previous life, Ye Qingtang lived in the Central Mainland for a period of time. Thus, she had seen and heard about some talents.

Earlier on, Ye Qingtang saw a figure which appeared thin and weak.

“Eternal Dynasty’s… Yin Yang Boy…” Ye Qingtang mumbled.

Although it was not a good thing that the Central Mainland’s talents entered this place, it was fortunate that that ancient clan was situated in a remote area of the Central Mainland, and they should not have received news in a short time. Otherwise, the consequences would be dire.

Currently, Ye Qingtang had placed all her hopes on the Dragon Vein.

The Dragon Vein absorbed eighty to ninety percent of the spirit energy on this mainland. If she could enter it, it would be easy for her to break through to Yin Yang Perfected Lord given her current martial endowments.

“Haha, there’s no need to worry.” A proud expression filled Master Du’s face swiftly. “Although those fellows have frightening skills, they don’t know where the entrance of the Dragon Vein is and only sensed the Dragon Vein’s aura. Just let them find it slowly!”

Ye Qingtang laughed. As Master Du had said, the Dragon Vein was hidden and extremely hard to find; otherwise, people would have found it centuries ago. Nonetheless, it had not been long since the three sects found the Dragon Vein.
