“Apart from those famous powerful figures, the number of people in the younger generation who possess a blue spirit root could be counted with just a hand. Ah… that seems to be Shen Qingyu.” A sharp-eyed disciple noticed a shy young boy with delicate features in the crowd of Wind Moon Sect people and pointed towards him.

A cold glint flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes after listening to the Yunxiao Sect rumors from aside. She looked in the direction that the person was pointing to.

Ye Qingtang was stunned from this look.

Wasn’t the young boy who was standing amongst the Wind Moon Sect disciples the little guy she met in Deer City that day?

Back then, Ye Qingtang could tell that he was very gifted but had too little experience and was very pure. Yet, unexpectedly, he actually had such a powerful background…

“Isn’t this… that little imp?” The Blood Moon Sect Elder beside Ye Qingtang took a look and identified Shen Qingyu in an instant.

Was this not the little boy whose body he wanted to take over?

He already knew that this boy’s endowments were extremely stunning that time, and his body was the most suitable for the Blood Moon Sect Elder to take over. However, Ye Qingtang foiled his plans in the end and forcefully stuffed him into Zhou Qu’s lousy body.

If he had seized Shen Qingyu’s body back then, his current skills would probably be better than Ye Qingtang.

At that thought, the Blood Moon Sect Elder could not help but throw Ye Qingtang a resentful look.

This darn girl was clearly born to jinx him!

If he had not met her in Deer City, he would probably be living the life somewhere a long time ago. Why would he still need to be cooped in a sect and suffer the restraint of a group of people from the righteous sects?

The more the Blood Moon Sect Elder thought about it, the more infuriated he was, and he could not stop himself from shooting a glare at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang raised a brow as she tapped on the Demonic Blood Sword casually.

A chill ran down the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s spine, and his face immediately froze.

Shameless!

If he could not defeat her, he would not let himself be bullied like this.

What could the Blood Moon Sect Elder do though? Even if he was already burning with hatred, he did not dare to show it on his face at all and could only smile at Ye Qingtang awkwardly.

Ye Qingtang looked away. Then, the other Xuanling Sect disciples were suddenly looking at a tall and good-looking disciple in the Qinglin Sect team.

In the group of Qinglin Sect people, the disciple’s position was clearly different from that of others, and even the Qinglin Sect elders smiled at him.

“Fu Lingtian’s condition this year seems to be even better than last year. This fellow clearly could be promoted as an elite disciple of Qinglin Sect but just had to participate in the Three Sect Competition with us.” The Xuanling Sect disciples were moodier the more they thought about it. It was not that their skills were bad, but Fu Lingtian was truly powerful. In the past few years, as long as he was present, the disciples from other sects did not need to think about being the champion of the Three Sect Competition.

The disciples who were officially participating in the competition felt their blood freeze just by looking at Fu Lingtian.

Ye Qingtang took a look as well. Fu Lingtian had a striking appearance, and it was no wonder Qinglin Sect valued him this much. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The Blood Moon Sect Elder followed Ye Qingtang’s gaze and looked over as well, but this caused his brows to furrow unconsciously.

“This fellow… is a little strange.”

“Why?” Ye Qingtang looked over. She initially thought that the Blood Moon Sect Elder wanted to take over Fu Lingtian’s body after seeing that he had good endowments, but when she looked at the odd expression on the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s face, she faintly sensed that something was off.
