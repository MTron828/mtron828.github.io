Chapter 1115 A Single Spark Can Start A Prairie Fire (5)

After hearing Ye Qingtang, Blood Moon Elder actually behaved contrary to his usual behavior and shook his head repeatedly. “Holy Lady, you are heading to the north of this mainland… That place is extremely dangerous, but I am very familiar with that place. There definitely won’t be any wrong to bring me along…”

Before Ye Qingtang could speak, Blood Moon Elder said again, “Holy Lady… moreover, you should at least let me possess a powerful figure’s body and go back to a male body… Actually, it doesn’t matter whether it is powerful or not. The most important thing is to return to a male body…”

Ye Qingtang shot Blood Moon Elder a look immediately. Given Blood Moon Elder’s position as the Eldest Young Lady in Ouyang Family, he would have returned to a male body a long time ago if he wanted to. Noticing Ye Qingtang’s reaction, the Blood Moon Elder was a little guilty, and he laughed awkwardly. “Actually… girl or boy… that is not important. The most important thing is to… become even more powerful… and possess a powerful figure’s body…”

Ye Qingtang stayed silent for a moment. After sizing up the Blood Moon Elder, her lips suddenly curled up into an ambiguous smile. “Sure. Follow me then.”

The Blood Moon Elder shuddered instinctively when he saw Ye Qingtang’s expression.

Back when he entered the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm with Ye Qingtang, she also behaved this way before, and afterward… he, a dignified man, became a little maiden…

“Let’s go!”

Without giving the Blood Moon Elder time to think, Ye Qingtang grabbed him and immediately ascended to the sky, disappearing without a trace.

“Too… fast… already!!”

The Blood Moon Elder was pulled into the air by Ye Qingtang. The moment he opened his mouth, a wild gust of wind gushed into his mouth, and his entire face was almost distorted.

The Blood Moon Elder was shaken. He had only been apart from Ye Qingtang for a while, and now that they met again, her martial skills had already reached this frightening stage… Half a day later, Ye Qingtang finally arrived at the northern region of the mainland with the Blood Moon Elder.

Ye Qingtang slowly landed on a small island and cast the Blood Moon Elder aside.

“Yin Yang Perfected Lord Eighth Heaven…” The Blood Moon Elder stared at Ye Qingtang in astonishment. Over a few months, Ye Qingtang actually entered the Yang Lord realm. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Holy Lady, your martial talent… is truly frightening…” The Blood Moon Elder stared at Ye Qingtang and exclaimed.

Looking at the Blood Moon Elder’s stunned expression, Ye Qingtang was, however, extremely calm.

Frightening?

If Blood Moon Elder saw Little Luo Xue and Little You Yun, he would then know what was truly “frightening”: “Miss Ye, you should have arrived at the northern region of the mainland already, haven’t you?”

Before waiting for Ye Qingtang to speak, Ling Yan’s voice sounded from the voice transmission stone. Blood Moon Elder was slightly dumbfounded to hear his voice.

Without explaining to Blood Moon Elder, she replied straightforwardly. “I’m here.”

“Miss Ye, there’s no need to act rashly. The You Ancient Clan is extremely strong in discipline and planning. Before invading a mainland, they must have their own troops and deployment. You can understand the situation clearly first and inform me afterward,” Ling Yan said with a chuckle.

“I think the same too.” Ye Qingtang was in full agreement with Ling Yan’s suggestion.

To know one’s own strengths and the enemy’s was the sure way to victory. If they did not even know the basic headcount and troops of the You Ancient Clan and stormed into You Ancient Clan’s temporary headquarters, it was simply seeking death.

For the entire day, Ye Qingtang brought Blood Moon Elder around to survey almost the entire northern region of the mainland.
