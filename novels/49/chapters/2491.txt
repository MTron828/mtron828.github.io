Actually, there was no need for the Yongle Tribe General to explain. It was obvious.

“Resurrect… memory is a mess. What are you talking about?” The Blood Moon Elder looked at Yongle Tribe General again and frowned deeply.

Did this man mean that he was dead and had been resurrected? What nonsense!

“Ancestor, there’s something I forgot to tell you. I need to tell you now.” The Yongle Tribe General seemed to have remembered something.

“Speak,” Ye Qingtang replied.

“Ancestor, it’s like this. I don’t know how powerful this person was when he was alive, but his soul is in this new vessel and the cultivation level of this vessel is very weak. Therefore, he might need to start his cultivation from scratch again.” The Yongle Tribe General explained to Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang was not surprised by this. She knew that it was naturally impossible to preserve the Blood Moon Elder’s cultivation foundation when he was alive. To put it bluntly, the Blood Moon Elder was at most only a highly-skilled practitioner in the First Mainland when he was alive. In this current situation, his past powers were not even worth mentioning. It would be very easy for her to help him recover his cultivation level.

Even for the Divine Lord stage, it was not difficult for Ye Qingtang.

Furthermore, as long as the Blood Moon Elder’s soul power could increase, he could even possess and control a powerful Emperor-level body.

Ye Qingtang had already had everything planned out for the Blood Moon Elder. The most important thing now was to enhance his soul power, and not his cultivation level.

The Blood Moon Elder had the divine power of possession and did not need to worry about his cultivation level. The main thing was his own soul power.

“Wait, I remember now…” At that moment, the Blood Moon Elder’s gaze landed on Ye Qingtang. This was not the Holy Lady’s brother. Didn’t the Holy Lady look like this when she was disguised as a man?

“Zang, it’s been hard on you today. I’ll bring him away now. You go back and rest first,” Ye Qingtang hurriedly instructed the Yongle Tribe General.

“Alright. Farewell, Ancestor.” The Yongle Tribe General respectfully bid Ye Qingtang farewell.

“Follow me.” Ye Qingtang turned around and looked at the Blood Moon Elder.

Although the Blood Moon Elder did not know what was happening, he still followed Ye Qingtang and left the hall.

...

Along the way, Ye Qingtang did not say anything. The Blood Moon Elder followed behind her. Although he was full of doubts, he did not ask.

After a few minutes, Ye Qingtang brought the Blood Moon Elder back to her room.

Initially, the big yellow dog was licking its fur in its kennel and was about to say something when it saw Ye Qingtang enter. An extremely ugly middle-aged man followed Ye Qingtang in.

The big yellow dog looked at Ye Qingtang and the ugly middle-aged man thoughtfully. After pondering for a few seconds, it shook its fur and stood up, wagging its tail. “Let me ask first. Do I need to go out for a while?”

The Blood Moon Elder was shocked when he heard the big yellow dog. Was he hallucinating?

How could a dog talk?

However, the Blood Moon Elder soon realized that he was not hallucinating. His Holy Lady had started a conversation with the big yellow dog in front of him…

Ye Qingtang stared at the big yellow dog in confusion. “Do you need to go out…? How would I know?”

The big yellow dog smiled. “Didn’t expect that you would have… such unique tastes.”

Ye Qingtang, “…”
