Chapter 992 The Long Family (4)

When they heard Long Rui’s words, everyone in the Ye Family was shocked.

Long Rui’s father, the Master of the Long Family, the invincible half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord!

“Doomed... doomed... we’re doomed...” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“We’ve actually... actually disturbed a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord...”

The senior members of the Ye Family looked rather stunned.

The Great Elder clenched his fists. He had not expected matters to reach this stage.

The Third Elder gritted his teeth. This Ye Qingtang had not only brought disaster on herself, but she had also brought disaster on them and the entire Ye Family!

A person could be arrogant and ignorant, but not that arrogant and ignorant!

The Long Family was so powerful. No matter what kind of destiny and treasures Ye Qingtang had obtained from the sect’s mystic realm, no matter how powerful she was, she could not possibly oppose the Long Family!

To Long Rui and the others, it was not important that Ye Qingtang had killed the two maidservants from the Long Family. However, the treasures in the Ye Family were shocking. Even her father would be shocked and shaken when he arrived and saw the premium yellow-grade weapons and the priceless elixirs, much less Long Rui.

If they could completely possess these items, the Long Family would be elevated.

Before entering the Ye Family, Long Rui had already ordered the guards of the Long Family to completely surround the Ye House.

Ever since the Ye Family had attacked the Duan Family, Long Rui had already decided to uproot the entire Ye Family and avenge the Duan Family.

“Third Elder, your Ye Family certainly has many treasures.”

Long Rui suddenly looked at the Third Elder of the Ye Family and blandly spoke.

When he heard that, the Third Elder immediately smiled ingratiatingly. “Miss Long Rui, you can choose any that you like. As long as it catches Miss Long Rui’s eye...”

“Of course, I like them. However, I am not just choosing one or two. The Long Family wants them all,” said Long Rui.

Many of the Ye Family’s disciples looked helpless when they heard Long Rui’s words. These treasures were too far beyond their grasp. If they forcefully retained them, they would certainly die. In the end, they still had to hand these treasures over to the Long Family...

“Haha, Miss Long Rui, if you like them, you can take them all. In any case, our Ye Family was preparing to present all these divine weapons and elixirs to the Long Family,” the Third Elder said hurriedly.

Although Ye Ling, the Great Elder, and the Second Elder were currently displeased with the Long Family, the Long Family was just too powerful. If they wanted to protect the Ye Family, this was their only choice. If they rebelled, the consequences would be disastrous.

If it was the Duan Family, the Ye Family might still fight to the death, and at worst, both sides would suffer losses. But the Long Family was different. In the face of such a huge entity, the Ye Family did not have any room to protest.

“I am very curious as to how the Ye Family suddenly acquired so many divine weapons and Dharma treasures. Or perhaps the Ye Family has a strong foundation that it did not display in the past.” Long Rui looked at the Third Elder and carried on talking.

“Miss Long Rui... all these were brought back by the Eldest Young Lady of our Ye Family, Ye Qingtang. As you know, Ye Qingtang is an outer sect disciple of a sect and had the immense good fortune to enter the mystic realm of the sect. She was rather lucky and obtained these destinies...” The Third Elder recounted the facts.

Long Rui looked thoughtful when she heard the Third Elder’s words.

Just as Duan Tianrao had guessed, this Eldest Young Lady of the Ye Family must certainly be carrying a great treasure on her person.
