Chapter 1128: A Fight Between Formidable Opponents (3)

“Holy Lady… leave me a body!” Blood Moon Elder saw that Ye Qingtang had killed all the You Ancient Clan senior executives and was about to weep.

Although those senior executives only had a martial cultivation base of Yin Yang Perfected Lord Sixth Heaven on this mainland, it was only so because they were poisoned and the thin spirit energy on this mainland restricted their ability. If they were back at the Central Mainland, they were at least at the second stage Divine Arcane Supremacy of the Arcane Supremacy realm…

“There’s limited time.” Ye Qingtang looked at the Blood Moon Elder.

If that demonic creature rushed back, they would probably die here, and there would be no time for the Blood Moon Elder to possess a body.

“Holy Lady… you must leave me with one the next time… Looks, height, and age are not important. The only two conditions are for it to be a male and a powerful figure. I will not be greedy for more…” The Blood Moon Elder said with a face full of smiles.

“F*ck. Why are you so troublesome? Just possess any body. So many requests.” The little white tiger shot the Blood Moon Elder an eye.

The Blood Moon Elder’s lips twitched slightly when he heard the little white tiger…

Had he… completely become a woman in the eyes of this Fiendcelestial Beast now?!!

“Die… all… must die!!”

Before waiting for the Blood Moon Elder to retort, a furious roar could be heard from outside Wind Cloud City.

Ye Qingtang and the rest looked outside the city immediately.

The human-looking demonic creature was back at Wind Cloud City!

“The Illusory Spell was broken…” Ye Qingtang frowned deeply.

Even a powerful human might not be able to escape from the high-level Illusory Spell that Ling Yan set using the power of karma, much less a demonic creature with a low spiritual sense…

Given Ye Qingtang’s calculations previously, it would take at least several hours for this demonic creature to see through Ling Yan’s Illusory Spell, but only how much time had passed?!

“Ling Yan, your Illusory Spell… was broken so quickly?” Ye Qingtang asked through the voice transmission stone. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

However, there was no response from the voice transmission stone at all.

“Ling Yan?” Ye Qingtang called once again but there was still no response.

“This damn Ling Yan actually dropped the ball at the critical moment! Unreliable!” The little white tiger said.

Without Ling Yan, how could they stop that demonic creature?!

Boom!! Boom!!

At this instant, the human-looking demonic creature descended from the sky. Unable to bear the massive weight, the ground cracked instantly. Gusts of wild wind were stirred up as though a disaster had arrived. Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder retreated backward unsteadily.

The demonic creature immediately scanned Wind Cloud City, and his eyes dilated when he saw that hundreds of You Ancient Clan people were killed.

“How… How dare… you all… General… will not let me off… General will be… punished by the commander… General will… kill me!!!” The demonic creature roared to the sky in rage.

Blood Moon Elder was alarmed.

The human-looking demonic creature before them was already so frighteningly powerful… It was still so fearful of the so-called General… as though the General could kill it with just a thought… And what shocked the Blood Moon Elder the most was that above the General, there was still a Commander. Exactly how… big and powerful was this You Ancient Clan?! How many powerful figures came!!
