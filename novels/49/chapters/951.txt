Chapter 952 Return to Lin Town (3)

“It’s not serious, so please don’t ask anymore.” Si Ye heaved a soft sigh. His voice was filled with resignation.

Since she saw that Si Ye was unwilling to say more, Ye Qingtang did not pursue the matter. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

After a moment, Si Ye had led Ye Qingtang to the study.

“Grandfather, Tang Tang is here,” said Si Ye.

“Come in.”

Master Si’s voice could be heard from the study. The voice seemed a little weak.

Si Ye immediately led Ye Qingtang into the study.

The old man sitting in the study was Master Si.

However, Master Si’s temples were now graying. Compared to two years ago, he had aged greatly. Furthermore, his face was lacking some of its normal colors. With Ye Qingtang’s ability, she could immediately tell that Master Si had suffered from a serious injury. Although he had recovered, it left behind some chronic ailments.

Considering Master Si’s age, an injury of this type was fatal.

“Tang Tang, when did you return?” When Master Si saw Ye Qingtang, he immediately stood and smiled as he spoke to her.

“I just returned to Lin Town today.” Ye Qingtang answered honestly.

“Tang Tang, I heard that you went to the Xuanling Sect to cultivate… why do you have time to return?” Master Si was somewhat surprised.

Lin Town was thousands of miles from the Xuanling Sect. A return journey would take a very long time. Considering Ye Qingtang’s situation, it was unrealistic for her to return to Lin Town under normal circumstances.

A remote little town like Lin Town was unclear about the matters relating to the various sects. They could not possibly know about the changes that had taken place in the Xuanling Sect. It was as if the sects and secular society were two completely separate worlds.

“Tang Tang, could it be that you did not become an inner sect disciple of the Xuanling Sect….” Si Ye asked as he looked at Ye Qingtang.

Half a year ago, Si Ye and the others had planned to travel to the sect and participate in the sect assessment. However, events in the town had delayed them.

Although a family in a small town did not quite understand the sects, they knew some of the basic rules.

In order to enter a sect to cultivate, one first became an outer sect disciple. The so-called outer sect discipleship was actually an assessment period. One could only become an inner sect disciple by passing the assessment within the assessment period. However, out of a hundred outer sect disciples, it was pretty good if even five became inner sect disciples.

Ye Qingtang’s sudden return to Lin Town naturally caused speculation.

Ye Qingtang smiled when she heard that. However, she did not wish to explain, as it would be too complicated. Instead, she simply kept quiet.

“Si Ye.” Master Si immediately shot a displeased look at Si Ye. Even if Ye Qingtang had not passed the sect’s assessment to become an inner sect disciple, Si Ye should not have asked so directly.

Si Ye also knew that he had committed a faux pas and looked at Ye Qingtang apologetically.

“It’s alright, Grandfather Si.” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“That’s right, Qingtang, have you gone home?” Master Si asked.

“After I arrived in Lin Town, I came to visit Grandfather Si first, so I haven’t gone home yet,” said Ye Qingtang.

Master Si nodded when he heard that. A contented expression surfaced on his face.

“Grandfather Si, where is Si Bai?” Ye Qingtang had not seen a trace of Si Bai since her return to the Si family and was rather curious.

“Third brother is not home,” laughed Si Ye.

“A year ago, after you left Lin Town, Grandfather ordered someone to nurse third brother according to the method you left, and he is much better now…”
