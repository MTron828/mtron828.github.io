Chapter 106: Illusion Array (4)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Yes.” Yun Shu wanted to tell Ye Qingtang about the illusion array. However… he did not have any chance to do so and had to leave for the next assessment.

The middle-aged man looked at Ye Qingtang with a complicated expression.

“Ye Qingtang, are you ready to enter now?”

Ye Qingtang took a step forward and nodded.

The illusion array was turned on.

Within the sect, the four sect elders were staring at the image from the Water Moon Mirror.

All of them did not pay much attention as Ye Qingtang walked inside the array.

“Yun Shu and Lu Xiuwen did quite well in the array. They could figure out the trick within such a short period of time.” Elder Lin was quite satisfied with both of their performances.

“Su Wan and Mo Yu were not too bad as well. I saw that they lasted inside for quite a long time. Though it’s not comparable with Yun Shu and Lu Xiuwen, they are still up to the standard.” The Elder of the Fist Faction also noticed some potential candidates.

“Illusion array is now ended then.” Elder Lin spoke softly and ignored Ye Qingtang, who just entered the array.

Elder Qin frowned.

Elder Lin sneered at Elder Qin’s reaction.

“Elder Qin, are you still thinking of that Ye Qingtang? She has only a red spirit root. The disciples previously could not last very long in the array. I’m afraid she will also…”

The moment when Elder Lin spoke, the four Elders were shocked by the scene from the Water Moon Mirror.

Ye Qingtang witnessed the illusions appearing in front of her, but she was unusually calm. She stared calmly at the level five demonic beast and did not step back at all. Suddenly, she pulled out her sword and pushed herself above the ground, dashing towards the beast.

The sharp point of the blade pierced through the heart of the demonic beast.

Without any extra moves, the demonic beast collapsed as its heart was pierced through. Its giant body turned into a ball of black fume and disappeared in front of her.

The four elders were astonished at the moment.

All demonic creatures inside the array were made from illusions. Though they possessed the appearances of level five demonic beasts, their actual strength was less than ten percent of the actual ones. They were almost like normal beasts.

However… all candidates were not aware of this, and no one revealed about that as well.

The fierce look of the level five demonic beast was enough to frighten the young men. Some of the previous candidates noticed the weakened beast. However, under the constant attack of the beast, its giant body, and cruel appearance, all these created huge pressure on the candidates. It was not easy to suppress the pressure.

But for Ye Qingtang…

She did not even blink before she killed the demonic beast made from illusion with one single move.

This… Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

This was really beyond the four elders’ imaginations.

After Ye Qingtang killed one beast, she noticed another two beasts made from the illusion.

Her mouth tilted.

The demonic beast would appear constantly inside the illusion array. Only breaking the array could end this totally. Even if one could kill a thousand of them, they would be trapped here forever.

This time, Ye Qingtang did not attack the two beasts, instead, she turned and rushed towards the opposite direction in the forest.

“That’s it… In the end, she still cannot control her fear.” Elder Lin was no longer shocked. He left a comment as he saw Ye Qingtang escaping from the beasts.

However, at the moment when Elder Lin left the comment, all Elders were totally stunned by Ye Qingtang’s next move!
