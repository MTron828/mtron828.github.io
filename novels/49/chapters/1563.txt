Chapter 1564 Potential 1

Elder Qian agreed. “The little monster was brought to the Taiyuan Valley when he was seven or eight years old. Foundation time was wasted. However, he showed incredible talent after just spending four to five years’ time here. No one in the entire Taiyuan Valley has better potential than him. If he had come back earlier, even Jiang Yanyun would not be able to fight him.”“If Ye Qingtang has the same amount of potential, it will be the best. With the mutant Heavenly Demon Bloodline inside her, she will improve significantly within a short period of time.” Jiang Yu had high expectations of Ye Qingtang. The mutant Heavenly Demon Bloodline in her brought enough hope to the Jiang Family.

If she had not been outside for ten years, she would already be very powerful under the family’s nurturing.

The three of them reached a compromise and called Ye Qingtang over.

Ye Qingtang saw the two inner sect elders here and could roughly figure out what was going on. But she did not express it out loud.

A special Dharma artifact was used to test one’s talent.

Jiang Yu and the rest led Ye Qingtang to the martial hall. Every newborn in the Jiang Family would be brought to the martial halls in Jiang Family to test their talent. The extremely talented ones would be brought away by the Elder Cabinet.

It was entirely empty in the martial hall. There was a huge round platform at the center. The pure and transparent pearl floating on top of the platform could test anyone’s potential.

Elder Qian looked at Ye Qingtang and said, “Go up there.”

Ye Qingtang stepped onto the round platform.

After Ye Qingtang stood straight, Elder Qian lifted his hand, and a string of spirit energy flew into the pearl.

After the spirit energy entered the pearl, a ball of fog suddenly arose from the pearl. The fog spread out slowly, and light rays flew downwards and surrounded Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang could feel that she was surrounded by something warm.

Under the platform, Jiang Yu and the two inner sect elders all stared at the light rays around Ye Qingtang, waiting for the test result.

Though Ye Qingtang had not been in the family for more than ten years, she had the mutant Heavenly Demon Bloodline that the Jiang Family valued the most at. As long as Ye Qingtang was talented enough, there would be another incredible genius soon.

Back then, the person with the mutant Heavenly Demon Bloodline was unbelievably powerful. The three of them were very clear about that.

Another person with the variant Heavenly Demon Bloodline now appeared in the Jiang Family. How could they not be excited?

The white light rays around Ye Qingtang sparkled were shining bright colors.

As the color changed, the two inner sect elders were more cautious now. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

After a short while, the light rays around Ye Qingtang showed a pale red color. The color was really light.

The expectation in Jiang Yu’s eyes changed into strong disappointment.

The red light represented one’s talent level. The deeper the red color, the more talented the person was.

The most powerful descendant in the Taiyuan Valley now, Jiang Yanyun, had blood-red light rays for the test.

The light rays were pure red to purple when testing the little monster...
