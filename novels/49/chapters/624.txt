Chapter 625: Whose Heart Is It

Ye Qingtang did not have any suspicions about the little white tiger’s words. Both of them had already signed an equality contract. Moreover, there was no reason for the little white tiger to lie.

“Furthermore, that extraordinary lady was a Miss of an ancient clan from the Central Dynasty in this domain…” The little white tiger added.

“Central Dynasty, ancient clan…” Ye Qingtang was in thought.

In this domain, the strongest mainland was the Central Mainland which had several large dynasties, with the Central Dynasty being one of them.

The Central Mainland could represent the peak of the martial cultivation in this domain, and those ancient clans were especially scary.

“Actually, that extraordinary lady is pitiful as well.” The little white tiger sighed. “She was different from everyone else since birth, and it resulted in an anomaly in Heaven and Earth. When she became an adult and was discovered to possess the bloodlines of Buddhas and Perfected Immortals, the entire Central Mainland was shaken.

Afterward, there was internal chaos within the ancient clan. The extraordinary lady’s father was the Clan Master of the ancient clan but was killed. Then, the entire Central Dynasty was searching for that extraordinary lady and wanted to eat her flesh to increase their own abilities. Helpless, that genius lady left the Central Mainland and searched for the origins of her bloodline, eventually finding the Fourth Domain…

It seemed that she returned to the First Domain after knowing some secrets regarding the Fourth Domain. She initially planned to conceal her identity but found this deserted area and created this mainland due to her kind nature. However, no one could have expected that she would eventually be killed by those ungrateful wretches. F*ck, it’s truly a grievance.”

“She truly is extraordinary.”

Ye Qingtang sighed. She could only lament that fate made fools of people. As a descendant, how was she to make any judgments?

The ungrateful wretches that the little white tiger said indeed should die. But those batches of people had died from old age a long time ago. While the people on this mainland currently were the descendants, they were innocent… ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Right and wrong—how could descendants like them comment on this…

As the little white tiger stared at Ye Qingtang, it grinned like a human and flashed a few tiny sharp teeth. “I see that you have some knacks as well. The thing that absorbed all of the demonic powers from my body just now should be the heart in your body, right?”

After hearing the little white tiger, Ye Qingtang was suddenly alarmed. Instinctively, she unsheathed the Demonic Blood Sword, and a deadly, cold glint flashed across her eyes.

“F*ck you… I’ve already signed the equality contract with you… What are you afraid of? Can I betray you!” The little white tiger was indeed frightened when it saw the glint in Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

Clank!

The Demonic Blood Sword was kept back into its sheath by Ye Qingtang who locked her eyes on the little white tiger. “How do you know about my heart?”

“You wish to know?” The little white tiger looked at Ye Qingtang meaningfully.

“Say it quickly.” Ye Qingtang frowned.

“It’s not that I don’t want to say… but currently, I’ve signed the equality contract with you already, and not saying is for your good. F*ck you, don’t fail to appreciate my kindness.” The little white tiger had a proud look on its face.

Immediately, Ye Qingtang held the Demonic Blood Sword against the little white tiger’s neck.

“Cough cough… Actually, it’s good to say it as well…”

The little white tiger moved its neck away and said, “I’ll tell you honestly… My father once sparred with ancient Buddhas and Perfected Immortals. Thus, I am extremely sensitive to the powers of ancient Buddhas and Perfected Immortals. That heart of yours has that aura. Although it’s thin, it cannot escape from my nose.”

After hearing that, Ye Qingtang rolled her eyes at the little white tiger. The heart in her body was the Heart of the Demon God. How could it be related to Perfected Immortals or even ancient Buddhas? Such a thing was definitely impossible.
