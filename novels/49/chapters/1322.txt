After Ling Yan left, all the ministers praised Ling Yan profusely and expressed their approval of him.

Ling Yan’s reputation in the court instantly grew.

The Eldest Prince’s, Second Princess’s, and the Eldest Princess’s expressions were utterly ugly.

The border officials and disaster victims they had brought aroused the ministers’ suspicions instead, and they were taken away for questioning.

After all, the receipts that Ling Yan had signed were present, causing their version of events to be viewed suspiciously.

When they saw this, the Eldest Prince’s and Second Princess’s hearts thumped wildly. Fortunately, they had neither made a personal appearance nor revealed their identity when contacting these people. Even if these people revealed who had instructed them, it could not be traced back to the Eldest Prince and Second Princess.

After the court dismissed, the Eldest Prince and the others returned to his residence. The three siblings had ugly expressions, completely unlike their expressions when they had left the residence earlier.

“We were defeated by Ling Yan today!” The Second Princess sat down, her face filled with frustration.

“I did not expect what we did today would help Ling Yan instead. He not only resolved all the accusations, but he even seized the opportunity to gain everyone’s approval. We have really made a huge loss today.” The Eldest Prince’s face was ashen. He had been confident of victory, but to their surprise, they had lost the entire round.

Ling Yan’s move had been so excellent that they were unable to guard against it.

“Ling Yan even accused the Mo Family as well. That was really unexpected. Doesn’t he know that the Mo Family is his greatest source of support?” The Eldest Princess’s brows were deeply furrowed. She was perplexed by Ling Yan’s accusation of the Mo Family.

One must know that the Mo Family had always supported Ling Yan. Although the Mo Family could not compare to the Sacred Ground of Reflection or the Temple of Shadows, it held the military power in the Eternal Dynasty.

It wielded great influence in the imperial court, and that was one of the reasons they had not been able to get at Ling Yan so far.

But today, Ling Yan had actually accused the Mo Family without batting an eye.

After today, the Mo Family would soon fall from power.

This could not be good news for Ling Yan.

“Our move was lacking…” The Eldest Prince sighed, then lifted his eyes, and glanced at Ye Qingtang.

“Elder Ye, we were not properly prepared today and wasted your scheme.”

They thought that Ye Qingtang’s plan was sure to work, but they had miscalculated Ling Yan’s movements and wasted the opportunity.

“It doesn’t matter.” Ye Qingtang spoke casually, but she could not help but inwardly roll her eyes.

Not properly prepared?

What she saw today gave her an inkling of how this would play out. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

With the Eldest Prince and the others’ little talent, the outcome would probably be the same even if they prepared for decades.

They were no match for Ling Yan.

When Lady Ghost, who was standing nearby, heard what had happened, amusement lurked around the corners of her mouth. Her gaze seemed to accidentally fall on Ye Qingtang.

“After today, Ling Yan’s foundation will be even more stable. It won’t be easy for us to touch him.” The Eldest Prince’s face was gloomy.

But the Eldest Princess said, “In that case… can we drag Ling Yan into the Mo Family’s trouble?”

The Eldest Prince had a thought and involuntarily glanced at Ye Qingtang, as he thought of asking her for help.

Why was he looking at her?

Ye Qingtang was speechless, but with Lady Ghost at her side, she had no choice but to say,

“No.”

“Why?” The Eldest Princess could not understand.

Ye Qingtang really wanted to tell the Eldest Princess it was because they were too stupid, but could only say, “Ling Yan personally and publicly accused the Mo Family.”
