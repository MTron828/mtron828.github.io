Chapter 976 Do You Really Want Me To Compete? (2)

Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

By right, Dan Yifan’s skin should have been rapidly covered with ice toxin after being hit. Why did the ice toxin suddenly melt?

Duan Tianyun was rather perplexed but did not consider the matter further. Perhaps Dan Yifan had some life-saving Dharma treasure on him that he had brought from his sect.

With that, Duan Tianyun stood on the dais and swept a look at the ashen youths from the Ye Family. “Your Ye Family abilities are merely average. How dare you nobodies challenge the dignity of our Duan Family!”

The youths from the Ye Family all gritted their teeth and glared at Duan Tianyun, who was standing on the dais. Dan Yifan had already fainted from his injuries.

If even Dan Yifan could not compete with Duan Tianyun, how could they?!

“What’s the matter? Is no one from your Ye Family willing to come up on the dais? What a useless bunch.” Duan Tianyun looked dismissively at the group from the Ye Family.

The surrounding audience marveled at the sight before them.

They had thought that with Dan Yifan, the Ye Family might regain some of its status.

Who would have thought that Duan Tianyun would strip them of all their dignity?

“In the future, the Ye Family will certainly decline…”

“In the future, Lin Town will belong to the Duan Family and the Long Family.”

Duan Tianyun towered over them and looked down on the group from the Ye Family. He suddenly caught a glimpse of a slender figure.

Duan Tianyun’s expression flickered for a moment, and a trace of malice surfaced in his eyes. He suddenly raised his hand and pointed at the figure amidst the group from the Ye Family.

“Ye Qingtang, you are the Eldest Young Lady from the Ye Family. Don’t you have the courage to get onto the dais and stand up for your Ye Family?” Duan Tianyun suddenly singled Ye Qingtang out from among the crowd.

It was only then that everyone realized that the Eldest Young Lady of the Ye Family, Ye Qingtang, was also present.

Everyone immediately looked in the direction of where Duan Tianyun pointed.

Sure enough, a slender figure was quietly standing behind the group from the Ye Family. With such a gorgeous face, it was surely the Eldest Young Lady of the Ye Family, Ye Qingtang!

Ye Qingtang had left Lin Town nearly two years ago. Although rumor had it that she had entered the Xuanling Sect, the entire Lin Town knew that she was a mere red spirit root.

With her ability, it was already surprising that she could enter the outer sect of the Xuanling Sect. Even if she had entered the sect, she would probably not have advanced by much.

Now, even Dan Yifan of the inner Leiting Sect had been defeated by Duan Tianyun. As an outer sect disciple, what could she do?

Ye Qingtang had not expected Duan Tianyun to pick on her. However, her face was as expressionless as ever, as if she did not realize that everyone was looking at her in an unfriendly manner.

“Are you speaking to me?” Ye Qingtang raised her eyes slightly and looked at the arrogant Duan Tianyun, who was standing on the dais.

“Of course. Aren’t you the only Eldest Young Lady in the Ye Family?” Duan Tianyun raised his brows slightly, smiled, and said, “Ye Qingtang… your Ye Family has declined. The entire younger generation consists of a bunch of useless fools. As the Eldest Young Lady of the Ye Family, shouldn’t you represent them?”

With that, Duan Tianyun glanced at his second younger brother, Duan Tianrao, who was standing below the dais.

“You were previously engaged to my second younger brother, Tianrao. Fortunately, your engagement was dissolved. Otherwise, with your abilities, how could you be worthy to enter our Duan Family? However, given our past ties, if you get up on the dais, I will be merciful and not allow you to lose too spectacularly. How about that?”
