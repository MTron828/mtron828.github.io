Chapter 2425: Symbols (3)

“These symbols… why do they look so familiar?” Standing by the edge of the hole, Jing Ze stared at the symbols. Where had he seen them before?

He seemed to recall seeing the same symbols somewhere else.

“I also find them rather familiar. But I just can’t remember at the moment.” Yun Chen had the same feeling.

“I have definitely seen these symbols before. But where?” Lei Yan scratched his head. Surprisingly, even Lei Yan felt like he had seen them before.

The same feeling arose in Qin Feng, Mu Ziying and Nangong Lie, but Lu Yuanxiang and his team were left confused. They did not recognize those symbols at all.

“Teacher Lu, have you seen them before?” Yun Chen asked Lu Yuanxiang.

Lu Yuanxiang replied in the negative. He was feeling very puzzled.

“I remember!” Mu Ziying’s eyes lit up as if she recalled something.

“Where?” Lei Yan asked.

Mu Ziying replied, “In the Evil Soul Forest, in that…”

Mu Ziying suddenly recalled that while they were in the Evil Soul Forest, they had seen these symbols inside Night Soul Beasts’ hibernation cave inside the fiendcelestial tomb. Realization immediately dawned upon Qin Feng and the others at Mu Ziying’s words.

Meanwhile, Lu Yuanxiang was startled by the mention of the Evil Soul Forest.

“The Evil Soul Forest? You guys went to the Evil Soul Forest?” Gong Jinyun also looked at Mu Ziying in shock.

Even their teammates Ran Mo and the rest were also shocked.

It should be pointed out that the Evil Soul Forest was notorious for being an extremely dangerous place with Night Soul Beasts and countless monsters within. They had only heard of that place but had never ventured there. But looking at the reactions of Mu Ziying and her group, it looked like they had gone there before.

Mu Ziying looked at the faces of the others. Luckily she hadn’t mentioned the fiendcelestial tomb. After all, they had not told anyone about Ye Qing bringing them to the Evil Soul Forest for training.

At this moment, Ye Qingtang flew out from the hole. Her face was very grave. She had also realized the same thing as Mu Ziying and the others.

A strong sense of foreboding arose in her heart when she realized the symbols in the hole were the same as the ones in the fiendcelestial tomb.

“Teacher Ye, how is it?” Lu Yuanxiang asked.

Ye Qingtang didn’t answer immediately.

Why were there such symbols inside the cave where the monster came from?

Was there some linkage between the fiendcelestial tomb and this Wailing Well?

For the moment, Ye Qingtang could not confirm anything. She had no idea if the appearance of these symbols was coincidental or did it mean something else.

“Teacher Lu, where is the place where you encountered your monster? Can you lead us there to take a look?” Ye Qingtang asked. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

To confirm that the symbols were not just a coincidence, she had to take a look at another place where a monster emerged.

Lu Yuanxiang was taken aback. He never expected Ye Qing to ask to take a look at where they encountered the monster. He was hesitant but having observed Ye Qing during this period of time, Lu Yuanxiang knew that Ye Qing was wise beyond his years.

“Alright, I will take you there. But I cannot guarantee that the monster is not nearby.”

Ye Qingtang nodded.

With Mu Ziying around, they would be able to avoid stumbling upon a monster unawares.

Lu Yuanxiang led the way as the group headed toward where the first monster appeared. Meanwhile, the Flying Star Academy team had no idea what was going on. All they could do was follow the group ahead instinctively.
