Chapter 871 Divine Supreme Dharma Treasure

Perfected Gu Yun laughed coldly. The Sealed Sky Formation of the Supreme Academy was terrifying, but it was not unbreakable to him.

“Hahaha, Perfected Gu Yun, I have never expected that you would end up like this one day!”

Suddenly, Gu Tianhe, Li Bingxue, and Feng Wudang walked out from the dark slowly.

“Students of the Supreme Academy…”

Perfected Gu Yun’s eyes were filled with coldness when he saw the three people.

“How dare you betray the elder prince!” Perfected Gu Yun shouted coldly.

The three of them were stunned upon hearing Perfected Gu Yun’s words. Their faces were full of confusion. Was Perfected Gu Yun mad? What nonsense was he talking about?!

“What a joke. You’re just a Ling Yan’s servant. You know you’re going to die here today, and that’s why you start to talk nonsense!” Feng Wudang laughed coldly.

“Don’t bother to talk to him!” Li Bingxue said.

“You will all be dead when I break out of the formation.” Perfected Gu Yun shouted in anger.

Without giving any chance for the three people to speak, Perfected Gu Yun started to punch the Sealed Sky Formation that trapped him.

Boom!

Boom!

Boom, boom!!

Deafening sounds were heard continuously. It seemed that even the sky and the earth were going to break under Perfected Gu Yun’s punches.

Cracks appeared on the Sealed Sky Formation very soon under his punches.

The three people had different expressions slightly upon seeing that.

Perfected Gu Yun was indeed at the Divine Arcane Supremacy level. The Sealed Sky Formation that was set up by their level of cultivation would be broken into pieces by Perfected Gu Yun’s punches easily if they were outside this mainland.

It was lucky that the spirit energy on this mainland was not enough, which limited Perfected Gu Yun’s true martial ability. If not, they would definitely be dead after provoking Perfected Gu Yun!

“Hahahaha! Perfected Gu Yun, I’m advising you to stop wasting your energy and not struggle to escape here. The regenerating power of the Sealed Sky Formation is very strong. It’s useless unless you can break it instantly!” Feng Wudang sneered and said as he stared at Perfected Gu Yun, who punched continuously.

The cracks that were created by Perfected Gu Yun’s punches were recovering with noticeable speed. It seemed that the Sealed Sky Formation had not gone through any serious attack.

Perfected Gu Yun knew about the Sealed Sky Formation and stopped his movement.

In the darkness of the forest at the same time…

Two young men were observing the situation in front of them, and they frowned heavily.

“People of the Supreme Academy…” one of the men said.

“Perfected Gu Yun is trapped inside the Sealed Sky Formation?” the other man said.

“Humph, we were never in good terms with the Supreme Academy. Should we kill them all? They should have acquired a lot of good stuff from the Dragon Vein!”

“We should wait till they use up their energy!”

The two people were students of the Divine Virtual Academy in the Central Mainland. Around ten of them entered the Dragon Vein this time.

The Divine Virtual Academy and the Supreme Academy were in conflicts over the past hundreds of years. Whenever the students of the two academies met, they would use their swords to fight each other. One misspoken word might lead to a fight that determined one’s survival.

“You little bastards! You will be dead today.” A glint of cold light flashed across Perfected Gu Yun’s eyes. He then took out a gold square seal from his space ring. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Heaven Tremor Seal?! Divine Arcane Supremacy Dharma treasure!”

Gu Tianhe and Li Bingxue were shocked when they saw the square seal in Perfected Gu Yun’s hands.
