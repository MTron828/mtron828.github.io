Chapter 1841: Truth (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Tu Fu arrived at the temple and the once-resplendent inner palace was completely destroyed. Long abandoned, it only contained the shattered remnants of its former glory.

Like a madman, he flew all everywhere, searching for the familiar figure in the temple, but to no avail.

“I never betrayed you once, I’ve been searching for you all along. After everything we’ve been through, I’m still late... I’m sorry, I didn’t keep my promise. I didn’t stay by your side and protect you in your times of need... I’m sorry...”

Tu Fu’s voice could be heard in the illusion.

He searched every single corner on the battlefield, but he never found the Cursed True God. When he finally went back to the temple to search for one last hope, he found out...

The one he loved was already dead. Gone. All that was left of her was a consciousness that was filled with hatred. In the secret chamber of the temple, the Cursed True God’s remaining consciousness went out of control and Tu Fu was heavily injured.

It was at that exact moment that he realized that the one he loved was already consumed by hatred.

He gave up the option to leave and used the last vestiges of his life to inscribe an incantation on the wall for the Heavenly Demons. The moment the array was completed, his body was torn into pieces.

If she was no longer here, why should he even continue living?

The one he needed was no longer here. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

She was gone...

Since he wasn’t able to fulfill his promises when they were both alive, he would stay by her side forever once he died.

Tu Fu’s powers...

A part of it became a protective power that seeped into the black armor, protecting the Cursed True God’s remains forever.

Another part of it became a newly born Little Heavenly Demon that would search for her illusion...

These illusionary images flashed past Ye Qingtang and the Cursed True God’s eyes. Slowly, these hidden secrets had become unraveled.

Ye Qingtang was stunned. She recalled that she had seen the mysterious incantation in the temple. Back then, she had no idea what it was, but now... she finally understood.

Tu Fu had never betrayed the Cursed True God.

He had been searching for her all along. Then when she was gone he was using his life to protect her. Even when she had already become the sinister Cursed True God...

After all, she was the only one he had ever loved.

.....

Even after the illusion faded away, Ye Qingtang couldn’t muster the energy to pull herself together.

Never could she have imagined that Tu Fu had such deep love for the Cursed True God. He never once betrayed her. Just like how the Cursed True God was willing to give up her True God status to be with him, he chose death to protect her forever.

This was his form of redeeming himself, for not being able to save her.

These misunderstandings changed the once blissful and benevolent True God to become the Cursed True God that was consumed with hatred.

Ye Qingtang subconsciously lifted her head. Was it possible for the Cursed True God’s remaining consciousness to see all of this?

The moment she looked up, she was stunned.

The remains suddenly disappeared, and all that was left behind was a beautiful figure standing there.

This beautiful woman slowly lifted her head, looking at the radiant light in the sky. The corners of her lips quirked up as tears trickled down the corners of her eyes...

“Why didn’t you tell me earlier... Why?” Her voice was choked in sorrow.

Over these hundred thousand years, she had been filled with hatred...

But she had no idea that during these years, he had been by her side, protecting her all along.

Seeing the shattered pieces of black armor on the ground before her, the Cursed True God’s eyes were filled with despair.
