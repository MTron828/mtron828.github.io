Chapter 2001: Good Show (2)

“What a joke, you’re telling me to go there personally?!” There was no doubt that Bai Zhi was livid.

Xue Fu said, “The Ancient You Clan might not believe that the Netherworld Ring really belongs to the Crimson League, so I need Lady Bai Zhi to go with me.”

“Hmph.” Bai Zhi scoffed coldly with an impatient look on her face.

Despite Bai Zhi’s reaction, Ye Qingtang wasn’t worried at all and merely said, “You don’t have to go if you don’t want the Netherworld Ring back.”

Bai Zhi narrowed her eyes at Ye Qingtang. The League Chief had requested for the Netherworld Ring specifically and they had to return with it. There was no room for failure.

“Lead the way,” she said coldly.

Xue Fu sighed in relief after hearing this and started heading towards the Ancient You Clan with Bai Zhi. Ming Wang looked at Bai Zhi who was leaving the main hall and turned back to look at Ye Qingtang.

“Holy Lord, you’re not going?”

She nodded simply. “Aren’t we just getting something back? We don’t need that many people for that.”

With that, she got up slowly and walked back into the temple. But her expression quickly changed as she went back into the palace. She headed straight for Ling Yan’s room, scooped him up and flew towards the Ancient You Clan as quickly as she could.

The chess pieces were all in place. How could she possibly miss this good show?

“Miss Ye? Ling Yan was still drowsy and he was lifted into the air by Ye Qingtang.

“I’m bringing you to the Ancient You Clan to see something good,” she said with a smile. She couldn’t wait to see Bai Zhi’s expression after obtaining the Netherworld Ring.

As he looked at her gleeful face, Ling Yan dissolved into laughter. She felt a sudden tightness around her waist and turned to see Ling Yan hugging her waist tightly.

She was speechless.

An innocent look stared back at her.

“I’m weak, so I’ll be gravely injured if I fall,’ he said honestly with no shame at all.

The corners of Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched slightly. He was weak but not to the extent that he would die if he fell from such a height.

“I’m also afraid of heights,” he said with an unchanging expression.

Ye Qingtang was speechless.

Could he be any more shameless?

But she couldn’t drop him, so she just quickened her speed and flew towards the Ancient You Clan. She didn’t ask for more people to follow them so that the Crimson League wouldn’t sense anything amiss. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The more natural they acted, the more they could pass it off as an accident.

Furthermore, she was extremely intelligent and had never accused the Ancient You Clan directly. She had maintained that it could be a misunderstanding all this while. After all, when the time came, there would be no need for it since the Crimson League would accuse them themselves and destroy them.

In the blink of an eye, Ye Qingtang and Ling Yan were at the valley the Ancient You Clan was based in, hidden in the forest behind.

Xue Fu and Bai Zhi had already arrived.

The two wardens who had stolen from them previously and You Qiong were already standing outside the valley and they stared in shock at Xue Fu and the alien race girl in front of them.

They had really come?

Bai Zhi landed slowly and her gaze silently swept over the Ancient You Clan people. She gestured for Xue Fu to settle everything.

It was already rare that she was showing up to deal with matters regarding the First Domain herself. There would be nothing more humiliating than to have her speak with these lowlifes.

Xue Fu seemed to understand her meaning and stepped forward. “This is Lady Bai Zhi from the Crimson League. Please return the Netherworld Ring that you stole from us previously. The resentment between the Ancient You Clan and the Temple of Shadows had nothing to do with the Crimson League.”
