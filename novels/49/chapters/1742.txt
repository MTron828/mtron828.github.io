Chapter 1743: A Stunningly Gorgeous Woman (1)

Ye Qingtang and Little White Tiger walked over in the direction of the water sounds. After travelling several meters, they discovered one long, gigantic crack on the icy surface. It looked completely natural and the flowing water glimmered, showing no signs of frost at all. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“How is it possible for there to be a river here?” Ye Qingtang gave a slight frown. Before she could ponder this puzzle further, a clear melody drifted into her ears.

Ye Qingtang turned toward the sound and saw a slender figure sitting on the opposite bank of the river. The woman was dressed in pale blue and had an exquisite figure. Seated with her back facing the water, her hair was jet black and the ends of it trailed in the water.

There were plenty of beautiful women in this world and Ye Qingtang had seen more than her fair share. But none were as exceptional as the back profile of this lady. Some women were pretty only because they were well-groomed. Some women were beautiful because they had great bone structure.

That lady’s back profile alone was utterly gorgeous. Just one glance left an indelible impression.

A gentle, harmonious tune drifted over from that lady. It sounded elegant and refined, but also cheerful and upbeat. Every single note was full of unbridled joy.

Just that voice alone was enough to make one forget about being in such a dangerous place. One could not help but smile at that melodious voice.

Ye Qingtang was astonished but didn’t step forward. Too many bizarre things had happened in this mystic realm. How could she forget Sang Feiyu, who became a tormented plaything for some ice vines. Neither did she forget the resentful Qin Mo...

Ye Qingtang just stood there quietly watching the lady’s back profile and listening to her wondrous singing.

The sounds of trickling water accompanied that song, echoing across the endless ice fields.

Suddenly, the song came to a pause, and the lady by the lake slowly turned her head.

Just her side profile was enough to leave Ye Qingtang completely dumbstruck.

Even a female like Ye Qingtang couldn’t help being astounded by that face.

It was just a side view but already gorgeous beyond belief. The corner of the woman’s eye tilted pleasantly as if she was smiling. That fair, jade-like hand brushed gently across the surface of the river. The slight upward curl of those lips looked like it harbored all the joy in the world.

Ye Qingtang’s heart quivered.

She was no monster.

She subconsciously moved toward that woman, hoping to ask about this place.

But before Ye Qingtang could get near to the river, the gorgeous lady suddenly disappeared without a trace...

It was like she had never existed.

“Did you see that just now?” Ye Qingtang turned to ask Little White Tiger.

Little White Tiger nodded.

Ye Qingtang was full of suspicion. How did that woman disappear right in front of her? Once again, Ye Qingtang surveyed her surroundings. Apart from an ice mountain range nearby, there were no other geographic features.

It was almost as if she had seen an illusion. It was like it never existed.

Could it be there were illusions in this mystic realm?

But that voice sounded very real. Nevertheless, Ye Qingtang decided not to pursue it. There were too many strange things in this mystic realm. She instinctively felt that there were some things which one should not be overly curious about.

Just as Ye Qingtang was about to carry Little Heavenly Demon and Little White Tiger across the river and continue their journey, that singing voice once again drifted over from the nearby ice mountain range!
