Lu Yuanxiang was even more powerful than Ye Qingtang and he specialized in physical cultivation. His physical body was far stronger than your usual person. If someone else had suffered his degree of injury, that person would have already died on the spot.

Ye Qingtang sewed up his wound before smearing another large amount of medicine. Only then did she finally manage to bring Lu Yuanxiang back from the brink of death.

Lu Yuanxiang was still looking very pallid but at least his life was now out of immediate danger.

“What did you guys encounter? How did you sustain such severe injuries?” Ye Qingtang finally got the chance to ask.

Lu Yuanxiang shook his head.

“I don’t know.”

What? Ye Qingtang was taken aback.

Lu Yuanxiang took a deep breath. His face grew increasingly bitter and pained as if he was recalling some horrifying memory.

“We were just chasing after a small-sized demon when we met that monster. Before we had a chance to take a good look, it burrowed out of the ground…”

At that moment, Lu Yuanxiang and his team never imagined that they were going to meet their worst crisis ever.

While they were hunting that demon, the ground beneath their feet suddenly split open and a massive claw burst out. Before they could react, they were sent flying into the air by a tremendous force.

The Wailing Well was already very dark and murky. When the monster broke through, it raised a huge cloud of dust and they could only vaguely see that it was something shockingly gigantic. Just a single paw alone was enough to cover a hundred-meter radius.

“We were not able to defend ourselves at all. That monster’s power was completely different from the other demons here. An Emperor level… it might even have been above the Emperor level… I have never seen anything like that. I was unable to protect my students. I am useless.” Lu Yuanxiang felt like his heart was being torn apart when he recalled that scene.

He had fought to the death to save his students when that monster’s claw “gently brushed” against his chest.

It was just a gentle brush but it tore a huge hole in the powerful body of this practitioner who specialized in physical cultivation.

Luckily that monster didn’t chase after them. Otherwise, they would have all been destroyed.

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly. Since Lu Yuanxiang didn’t get a clear look at that monster, she could not analyze what kind of monster it was. But regardless, the cultivation level of that monster had already far surpassed what the teams could endure.

Emperor level and above? An Emperor level monster alone was not something that any of them could handle.

Lu Yuanxiang took a deep breath and struggled to calm himself. “Ye Qing, thank you.” For the first time, Lu Yuanxiang felt that this strange youth was not as unreasonable as he believed.

“Your injuries are no longer life-threatening but you are in no condition to continue the competition.” Ye Qingtang looked at Lu Yuanxiang.

Lu Yuanxiang was well aware of the situation.

After knowing the team competition’s rules, any logical person would infer that the most powerful teams would soon start to eliminate the other teams. It would be a bloodbath.

Meanwhile, he and his students were injured and exhausted. They were no longer in any condition to continue the fight.

“I know. I will have them crush the teleportation talisman soon and leave this place. Ye Qing… if not for you, I would have probably died in this place. Thank you.” Lu Yuanxiang was sincere.

With that, he called the teenager with the space ring over.
