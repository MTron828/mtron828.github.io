Chapter 1742: Looking For Food (4)

Little Heavenly Demon finished up the piece of meat in two bites. After that, it ran over to the dead ice beast. Copying Ye Qingtang’s earlier actions, it peeled off the skin of the beast’s entire arm. It then looked expectantly at Ye Qingtang.

“Ahh ooh! Ahh ohh!” It patted the exposed flesh excitedly.

“Hoo! Hoo!”

It wanted Ye Qingtang to roast this entire arm.

Amused, Ye Qingtang picked Little Heavenly Demon up before ejecting a stream of black flame toward the ice beast’s body, roasting it through and through.

Before long, the strong smell of roasted meat permeated the air. The back of Ye Qingtang’s hand was dripping with drool from Little Heavenly Demon.

Before Ye Qingtang let go of it, Little Heavenly Demon threw itself onto the freshly-roasted ice beast and started feasting away with no shame.

Meanwhile, Little White Tiger strode over and was flabbergasted by the sight of Little Heavenly Demon completely immersed in the joy of eating.

“Its own parents would probably crush it to death if they saw this.” It was the first time that Little White Tiger had seen such an unworldly Heavenly Demon.

Ye Qingtang chuckled before carving out a piece of meat for herself.

Little White Tiger was not hungry but enticed by Little Heavenly Demon’s lusty enjoyment, it also tried a few bites.

Damn, it really tasted pretty good.

“I realized now that you have the makings of a great chef.” Little White Tiger made sure to “praise” Ye Qingtang.

The corners of Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched slightly.

That ice beast was over a dozen meters tall and if it was only Ye Qingtang, she would take over a year to finish the entire thing. But the pint-sized Little Heavenly Demon managed to gnaw the ice beast down to the bone. It didn’t waste even the tiniest scrap of flesh.

Once again, Little White Tiger was bewildered by its voracious appetite.

It truly was a bottomless pit! RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Little Heavenly Demon had its eyes opened to a whole new world of gastronomy. It suddenly discovered that those disgusting monsters which it used to consume could turn into delicious food by Ye Qingtang’s black flame and gazed at Ye Qingtang in newfound adoration.

Having known the taste of delicious food, Little Heavenly Demon’s desire for such delicacies intensified. So much so that... when night fell and Ye Qingtang lit a bonfire, Little Heavenly Demon tried to drag Little White Tiger by the tail over to the fire. It looked like it was planning to roast Little White Tiger to eat!

Little White Tiger was incensed.

Was this glutton really going to eat it?!

On the other hand, Ye Qingtang was thoroughly amused. The arrival of Little Heavenly Demon had brought her a sliver of joy even in this terrifying mystic realm.

But to guard against Little Heavenly Demon gobbling Little White Tiger up, Ye Qingtang would spend some time looking for food as they hurried along their journey. If they encountered extremely powerful monsters, they would take a detour to avoid it, or else make use of Little Heavenly Demon’s bewitching melody to escape. If they met some less powerful monsters, they would try their luck to kill it and roast its meat for food.

They ate so much that Little Heavenly Demon’s belly started to protrude.

Little Heavenly Demon’s greatest joy each day was to find traces of monsters in the snowy landscape.

Having just eaten its fill, Little Heavenly Demon sprawled lazily in Ye Qingtang’s arms, snoring softly. They had been journeying for a long time and they were now someplace where all was completely quiet. Nevertheless, Ye Qingtang suddenly heard the sound of trickling water nearby.

“How can there be the sound of trickling water?” Ye Qingtang couldn’t help feeling suspicious.

It must be pointed out that all liquids would have instantly froze in the Frozen Ice Fields. She had yet to see any signs of a water source since arriving here.
