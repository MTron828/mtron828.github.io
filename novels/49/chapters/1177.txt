Chapter 1178: Heaven City (6)

“Haha, good. Miss Ye is indeed as courageous as a man. I wish you a victory in your first battle!” Gu Yu nodded and said.

Immediately, Ye Qingtang leaped down from the city walls and landed on the ground.

Seeing that it was a young lady, the You Ancient Clan lady snickered. “Why? Does the South battlefield not have anyone already? You all actually sent a little lady here to accept the battle.”

Gu Yu shouted coldly from the top of the city walls. “I think you all are the joke. Miss Ye is a powerful figure sent by the headquarters. She is already a Yang Lord at a young age. Today will definitely be the day you die!”

Upon hearing that, the You Ancient Clan elderly snickered and signaled a finger at the man beside him. “Tianhe, kill this so-called young powerful figure sent by the headquarters.”

With the order, the green-robed man walked forward expressionlessly.

The You Ancient Clan army immediately retreated to make space for a large battlefield for Ye Qingtang and You Tianhe.

“Miss Ye, we believe that you will definitely be able to behead this You Tianhe given your skills.” Gu Yu’s voice traveled down very quickly.

Ye Qingtang sized up Gu Yu discreetly. It seemed that this overall commander of Heaven City really wanted her to die in the hands of You Tianhe.

“On the account that you’re a lady and that you’re so young, I’ll spare you three moves. After three moves, I will chop your head down.” You Tianhe stared at Ye Qingtang and said coldly.

“Spare me three moves…” Ye Qingtang sized up You Tianhe meaningfully. “That’s generous of you. I will not refuse it if that’s the case.”

The You Ancient Clan’s arrogance was what Ye Qingtang wished to see. This was a battlefield, and if her enemy wanted to spare her three moves, it was impossible for Ye Qingtang to reject it.

Suddenly, without any warning, Ye Qingtang turned into a white shadow at an extremely high speed that even the You Ancient Clan elderly afar could not help but be stunned. That lady’s speed and movement were truly exceptional! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Swoosh!

In the blink of an eye, Ye Qingtang was already in front of You Tianhe. A glint flashed across her eyes immediately, and she rammed a fist at You Tianhe.

You Tianhe’s eyes widened after sensing the force in Ye Qingtang’s punch, and he raised his hand to block it instinctively.

Boom Boom!!

A thunderous roar reverberated throughout the place.

Under everyone’s shocked watch, You Tianhe trembled intensely and staggered more than ten steps backward. It was only when he planted his feet on the ground did he finally diffuse the force from Ye Qingtang’s punch and stabilize himself.

“He fought… fought back?!”

The scene shocked all the archers and powerful figures at the top of the city walls.

Ye Qingtang’s cold gaze landed on You Tianhe, who was a few meters away from her, and she said indifferently, “The You Ancient Clan never goes back on their words. I believe everyone heard you promise that you would spare me three moves, but you fought back at the first move. That is disappointing.”

You Tianhe’s eyes turned golden. This lady was much more powerful than that young Mo Feng from that day. If he did not retaliate the force from that punch just now, the consequences would have been dire…

“Tianhe, kill her!” The You Ancient Clan elderly shouted furiously.

As the elderly spoke finish, an astonishing sword intent emerged around You Tianhe’s body.

The supposed sword intent was willpower cultivated by powerful figures of the Sword Dao. As long as this willpower was sufficiently powerful, it could annihilate anyone with just the slash of a sword!
