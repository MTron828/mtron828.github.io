Chapter 1870: Unexpected Discovery (1)

“Long Yi, promise me that when we find Aunt Jiu, you must protect her. We shouldn’t force her to come back, understood?” The girl’s expression became stern as she looked at Long Yi.

“Understood.”

After returning to the room, Ye Qingtang took one dosage of the Miracle Pills. It had a bitter taste and the bitterness spread all the way to her throat.

Almost immediately after, Ye Qingtang’s entire body was abnormally hot, as though she was soaking in a tub full of boiling water. It only took a while before she was completed covered in sweat.

Ye Qingtang could clearly feel her every pore being forced open from this surging energy.

There was no time to waste. Taking the spirit stones, she started to cultivate.

The effects of the Miracle Pills instantly showed. The energy in the spirit stones was instantly absorbed by Ye Qingtang’s body and rushed madly.

It was a significant improvement that left Ye Qingtang feeling surprised.

The thousand spirit stones weren’t wasted after all!

As Ye Qingtang didn’t want to waste any time at all, she quickly calmed herself and continued to cultivate.

It only took one night for Ye Qingtang to use up more than half of the few thousand spirit stones they had won earlier. By the time she was done cultivating, her entire body was soaking wet, as though she had just come out from a tub of water.

What surprised her even more was that as she perspired, she could see some dark grayish dirt coming out together.

“This Miracle Pills is capable of detoxification too?” Ye Qingtang was pleasantly surprised. She could feel the energy within her body increasing rapidly, with the speed being faster by almost three times. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Once the Heavenly Venerate realm reached the last few Heavens, it would experience changes in its attributes and likewise, the difficulty of cultivations would multiply and significantly increase.

With the aid of the Miracle Pills and the pure spirit energy from the spirit stones, Ye Qingtang realized that she had reached a higher level, almost attaining the Fifth Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate.

It was Ye Qingtang’s first time experiencing such a remarkable difference after coming out from the Illusory Void.

“No wonder these Miracle Pills are so popular within the Second Domain, it is truly a precious treasure.” A smile hinted at the edges of Ye Qingtang’s mouth and she wiped away the perspiration on her body. After changing into a clean set of clothing, she disguised her appearance into the ‘beautiful’ face she had yesterday, preparing to win big again.

Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo felt bad for receiving so much help from Ye Qingtang, but they knew for a fact that they had no gift in gambling at all. All they could do was offer their Dharma treasures to repay her.

Similar to the previous day, Ye Qingtang and Jiang Shaobai waited until the sky turned dark and they came up to the ground level of the Crystal Palace.

But there was someone earlier than them.

The girl and man from yesterday had already arrived before them. After the man said a few words to the girl, he headed outside by himself to work hard to afford their stay at the Crystal Palace.

When the girl saw them, she didn’t seem too happy. She merely made a soft ‘hmph’ sound before turning around and running towards Fu Qiu, who was biting on his opium pipe.

Ye Qingtang and Jiang Shaobai didn’t bother with that diva and they prepared to leave. Suddenly, they saw the girl taking a portrait out of the space ring and showing it to Fu Qiu.

“Have you seen this person before?” Her voice was hopeful as she asked.
