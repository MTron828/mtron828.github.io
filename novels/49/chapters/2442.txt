Chapter 2443: Big Yellow Dog (4)

The big yellow dog stared at Ye Qingtang. It looked like it was deep in thought.

It was only after a long time that the big yellow dog wagged its tail and spoke again. “I really don’t know anything about this “Wailing Well”. It has been too long. Perhaps there has been a name change.”

Before Ye Qingtang could respond, the big yellow dog changed the subject. “Oh yes, which immortal abode grotto-heaven are you from?”

Ye Qingtang was befuddled. She had no idea what this big yellow dog was talking about.

Immortal abode grotto-heaven? What was that? She had never heard of it before.

“Oh yes, how is your Boss?” The big yellow dog continued, oblivious to the puzzled expression on Ye Qingtang’s face.

“Immortal abode grotto-heaven… my Boss… are you suffering from rabies?” Ye Qingtang instinctively shifted away from the dog in case it was contagious.

“You don’t know about the immortal abode grotto-heaven?” Now the big yellow dog looked even more amazed than Ye Qingtang.

“Never heard of it.” Ye Qingtang shook her head.

“But surely you must know about Shi Tian?” the big yellow dog insisted.

“Shi Tian?” Ye Qingtang shook her head again. “Who is that…”

“How is this possible…”

It was clear that Ye Qingtang was not lying. The big yellow dog was in disbelief. “Don’t tell me I have been asleep for so long? Things have changed so drastically? You don’t even know about Shi Tian?”

Ye Qingtang was exasperated. In both her previous and current lives, she had never heard of the name Shi Tian. If he was really that famous, he would still be remembered even if he existed hundreds of thousands of years ago.

“What the hell are you talking about? You said you were asleep. What do you mean by that?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Let’s not talk about that first. Come, punch me,” the big yellow dog said anxiously

“What… What did you say?” Ye Qingtang was utterly confused. Did this dog really have rabies? It bit her just now, was it contagious?!

“Quickly, punch me. I promise not to retaliate,” the big yellow dog repeated.

Ye Qingtang, “…”

In her many years of living, no one had ever made such a request. A dog was begging her to punch it…

“Are you going to hit me or not? I will bite you if you don’t! I’m serious!” As if trying to prove its point, the big yellow dog bared its fangs and stared at Ye Qingtang’s arm, as if it was looking for the most tender spot to sink its teeth in. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

But Ye Qingtang fulfilled the big yellow dog’s wishes before it could bite her. She punched the dog square in the face.

But Ye Qingtang didn’t put in too much strength. After all, it was just a dog. With her current powers, what if she killed it?

“Arh-wooo…”

The big yellow dog howled so much after being punched by Ye Qingtang that it nearly fell off the tree. Luckily Ye Qingtang was fast enough to catch hold of it.

The big yellow dog whimpered in Ye Qingtang’s arms.

“You… You are so weak…” After a long time, the big yellow dog finally recovered itself and chided Ye Qingtang.

An exasperated laugh came out of Ye Qingtang’s lips at the big yellow dog’s words.

Weak? What was it that squealed like a pig just now after being punched by her?

It was nearly killed by that single punch. And now, it was chiding her for being weak. This dog was really shameless.

“Ha… sorry to disappoint you. Why don’t you let me punch you again? I promise to give it my all this time, as long as you don’t die. How about that?”

With that, Ye Qingtang tossed the dog out from her arms.
