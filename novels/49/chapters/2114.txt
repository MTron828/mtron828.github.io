Chapter 2115: Sea King (3)

But...

Ye Qingtang had underestimated how thick Elder Hua’s skin could be.

“Since you’re curious, I’ll explain it to you then,” Elder Hua said with a smile.

No, she wasn’t curious at all!

She wanted nothing more than to get out of there.

But Elder Hua wasn’t giving her a chance at all and quickly continued, “The Sea Clan will want to take back their magical object once they know that our Holy Lord is gone. It doesn’t matter if they take it back, but we can’t let outsiders find out that our Holy Lord is dead, so we’ll need to ask you for your help today...”

“I am sorry, but I won’t be able to help. Goodbye,” Ye Qingtang interjected before Elder Hua could finish speaking and turned to leave.

Don’t joke around!

She had long since seen through the Temple of Paragon’s intentions. Were they crazy? Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“You’re indistinguishable from our Holy Lord. We only need you to make an appearance as the Holy Lord and attend the celebration. As long as you help us with this, we’ll make sure to send you back to the First Domain safely,” Elder Hua stopped her and said in an affable manner.

“The Sea King is over there, as well as other top-tier powers. You want me, someone from the First Domain, to impersonate the Holy Lord? Do you think I’m an idiot? Or that those people in the main hall are stupid?”

“Of course, we’ve already considered this. As long as you put on our Holy Lord’s clothes which still have her aura and power, they will not realize,” Elder Hua said.

“Can I refuse?” Ye Qingtang asked.

With a troubled face, Elder Hua said, “I’m afraid not. I believed you when you said you weren’t the Holy Lord’s reincarnation, but many in the temple still harbor suspicions towards you, so...”

So they would reveal her true identity if she refused?

She had already been in the Temple of Paragon for so many days. They were only suspecting her now?

This was obviously a threat!

They had calculated all of this from the beginning!

“I’ve never interacted with your Holy Lord before, and don’t know how she is, so if anything happens...”

“We will take responsibility,” Elder Hua quickly said as she saw Ye Qingtang slowly coming around.

Ye Qingtang sighed. Could she even reject them?

“Where are the clothes?”

She could tell that the Temple of Paragon had already planned this a long time ago. Trying to get herself out of the situation was useless.

Joy filled Elder Hua’s face as she heard Ye Qingtang’s words. She quickly handed over the clothes that she had long prepared in advance.

Ye Qingtang looked at the luxurious clothes in front of her. Even though it was covered in dust, the aura left on it was still very strong. With a sigh, she walked into the room with the clothes and changed into them.

The Fox Demon’s shadow appeared in the temple as she left.

“Is everything going well?” he asked.

Elder Hua nodded. “Even though she is reborn, the Holy Lord is as intelligent and can understand the situation right now. Of course she made the right decision.”

“That’s great. You need to tell her about the other things as well,” he said.

“Of course. But... Guardian, if the Holy Lord ever regains her memory and finds out about this, she’s not going to be happy...” They were practically threatening the Holy Lord...

“What we’re doing today is to placate the Sea King and see if the Holy Lord will regain her memory. She will understand our effort. If the Holy Lord is able to rise to her peak again, I’ll gladly be smashed into smithereens after today,” the Fox Demon said. As soon as he finished speaking, he disappeared in a swirl of robes.
