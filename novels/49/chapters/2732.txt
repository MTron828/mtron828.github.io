Chapter 2733: The Second Tian (4)

“No, it’s not important anymore… No wonder you possess such terrifying strength at such a young age. The Dragon Clan is proud of you… if we can find your mother, our Dragon Emperor Clan will be complete,” Evil Deity said.

Indeed, Ye Qingtang had been searching for the whereabouts of her mother, Di Jiuyuan. But even after reuniting with her grandfather, she did not have any clues.

...

During her time in the Dragon Emperor Clan, Ye Qingtang kept searching for her mother’s whereabouts but did not find any new information. Even Ling Yan seemed to have vanished into thin air.

Ling Yan had not appeared since that distant era.

...

Years later.

The world trembled and the sky changed color. Large amounts of spiritual energy surged into the sky above the Dragon Emperor Clan from all directions. It was as if the end of the world was coming. The scene was unbelievable.

The Dragon Emperor Clan members emerged and looked toward the back of the mountain.

“That is Qingtang’s place of seclusion?!”

Elder Long stood beside Evil Deity with a shocked expression.

“She has broken through… What level of insanity is that…” Joy surfaced in Evil Deity’s eyes.

“Evil Deity, Miss Qingtang must have gotten at least a divine body,” Elder Long said.

Over the past few years, Ye Qingtang was already invincible in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain. The Dragon Emperor Clan grew to become the biggest clan in the Second Domain because of Ye Qingtang. It had just been a few years and Ye Qingtang actually broke through again.

“Just a divine body? Miss Qingtang’s power is no different from a god’s now. When has such a peerless genius ever appeared in the Dragon Emperor Clan!” Elder Long burst out in excitement.

“Jiuyuan, your daughter is not only a member of the Dragon Emperor Clan, but she is also the pride of the entire Mixed Heavens Holy Domain…” Evil Deity muttered.

...

At the back of the mountain, the big yellow dog glanced at Ye Qingtang. “That’s enough. Your skills are enough to shake the laws of the lower realm.”

At that moment, Ye Qingtang’s eyes and long hair had already turned from white to silver. She looked rather similar to the Silver Star Holy Lord.

“Ling Yan gave me a relic. It’s really effective,” Ye Qingtang muttered.

Over the past few years, she had used the relic that Ling Yan had given her to devour nearly half of the energy in the Heart of the Heavenly Dao. Her current strength was enough to shake the laws of the lower realm.

“It’s here.” The big yellow dog looked up into the sky.

“I might not be able to do it.” Ye Qingtang frowned deeply as she looked at the Heavenly Tribulation in the sky.

The first time she witnessed the Heavenly Tribulation was because of the Heavenly Emperor. She never expected her second time seeing the Heavenly Tribulation to be because she had to transcend it.

“Don’t worry, I’m here. No need to worry.” The big yellow dog shook its tail.

Ye Qingtang’s pupils constricted. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

It was here. The giant shadow that nearly killed the Heavenly Emperor back then, hiding behind the thunderclouds.

At that moment, a pair of huge blood-colored eyes peeped at Ye Qingtang through the thundercloud.

“Now that you have seen me, shouldn’t you be fleeing in fear!”

However, the yellow dog raised its head and roared at the giant shadow. When the blood-colored eyes landed on the big yellow dog, its huge body seemed to tremble.

“Tian…”

A terrified voice rang out from the giant shadow’s mouth before disappearing without a trace. Even the Heavenly Tribulation had vanished.

What in the world?

Ye Qingtang was shocked by the scene before her.

What did the giant shadow say just now?
