Ye Qingtang could not help but secretly sneer after hearing Xuanyuan Yi’s words.

Xuanyuan Yi was truly an old fox for pushing all blame away from himself thoroughly.

“Xuanyuan Yi, I don’t have the energy to chat with you.”

After saying that, Ye Qingtang turned around and wanted to leave.

“Ye Chen, where do you wish to go?” Seeing that Ye Qingtang wanted to leave, a glint flashed across Xuanyuan Yi’s eyes immediately, and he raised an arm to repress Ye Qingtang

Swoosh!

Almost in a flash, Ye Qingtang erupted her primordial qi. Two golden phoenix-like wings flapped, soared to the sky, and flew ahead.

“Grandfather, this little bastard cannot be a disciple of the hidden clan. Otherwise, how could he escape like that!” Xuanyuan Lie hurriedly told Xuanyuan Yi when he saw Ye Qingtang leaving the place.

Xuanyuan Yi scoffed after hearing that. He obviously knew that Ye Qingtang was most likely not a disciple of the hidden clan and did not need Xuanyuan Lie’s reminder. He had his reasons for not killing Ye Qingtang, but his foolish grandson did not even understand this simple reason.

“Humph. Can she escape though?”

A gleam flashed across Xuanyuan Yi’s eyes immediately. In the blink of an eye, he had already disappeared from the ground, turned into a bolt of white light, and flitted across the sky.

Ye Qingtang’s primordial qi was raised to the maximum currently. She did not head to Master Du’s but fled out of the city.

“Old thing…”

Not long later, Ye Qingtang’s body trembled slightly. Xuanyuan Yi’s Yin Yang Perfected Lord Third Heaven aura had locked onto her, but she did not think that he would chase up so quickly.

A moment later, Ye Qingtang was already out of the monarch city, and ahead was a natural canyon.

“Ye Chen, you have already committed a serious offense. Return to Falling Sky Valley with me immediately or bear the consequences yourself.” Xuanyuan Yi’s voice sounded behind Ye Qingtang

“Old thing, you really don’t have any self-respect. Why are you clinging to me?” Ye Qingtang sneered.

Xuanyuan Yi’s eyes flickered upon hearing that, and he shouted coldly. “Ye Chen, if you continue to be so stubborn, don’t blame me for breaking your limbs and ruining all your cultivation base before throwing you back to Falling Sky Valley.”

“Xuanyuan Yi, I am the disciple of the Valley Master, Perfected Xuanchen. Aren’t you afraid of my Master’s wrath?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Ye Chen, you don’t need to say anymore. I’ll naturally explain the situation to the Valley Master.” As Xuanyuan Yi spoke, he raised his arm and launched a blow at Ye Qingtang, who was a thousand meters away.

In the next second, a wild wind along with a frightening force swept towards Ye Qingtang.

As she felt the might of Xuanyuan Yi’s attack from a thousand meters away, the expression in Ye Qingtang’s eyes changed immediately.

If she was really hit by the blow, even those ordinary Yin Yang Perfected Lords would be severely injured, much less herself, a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord.

Given Xuanyuan Yi’s martial skills, he could kill Ye Qingtang in at most a few breaths.

However, Xuanyuan Yi had some concerns, and it was inconvenient for the current Ye Qingtang to die in his hands. As such, he only controlled his strength at a level which would injure Ye Qingtang severely. Otherwise, Ye Qingtang would not have been able to flee to this place.

As the might of the attack came upon Ye Qingtang, the ink-colored sword was unsheathed sharply, and she slashed out with all her primordial qi.
