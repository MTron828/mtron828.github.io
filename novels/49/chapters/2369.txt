Chapter 2370: Chess (3)

“Yes,” Ran Mo replied. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The person gave a sudden laugh. He picked up Ran Mo’s jade pendant and examined it casually.

“Tsk tsk. I knew it. Who else in the Netherworld Academy can get something like this? So you are Wu Fengling’s famed disciple. No wonder. After all, President Wu would only give something like this to his own disciple…”

Lei Yan and the others realized that this jade pendant was no ordinary item.

“Little Mo Mo, what is this jade pendant?” Lei Yan asked.

Ran Mo didn’t answer his question but only stared back at the arrogant guy. “We have the appropriate stakes now. Are we playing?”

“Of course. As long as you can bear to lose it, I welcome you.” The person smiled with a shrug.

Ran Mo dragged Lei Yan over to the table.

Lei Yan felt rather panicked.

“What is that jade pendant? Little Mo Mo, I don’t want to play anymore. It was just a spur of the moment. Let’s not play…” Lei Yan didn’t manage to finish his sentence. Ran Mo interrupted him with a serious look on his face.

“You need to play.”

Lei Yan was stunned.

What was going on?

“Ran Mo, forget it.” Qin Feng’s brows were furrowed slightly. He had no idea what that jade pendant was but it must definitely be very important. And Wu Fengling himself had given it to Ran Mo…

Observing the situation, the person tossed Ran Mo back his pendant with a smirk.

“Yes, I think we should just forget it. The Netherworld Academy probably only has one of these, so you’d better keep a hold on it properly. After all, you guys are different from the rest of us. This item must be extremely rare and precious to you. You guys… cannot afford to lose it.”

Seeing that the situation was not quite right, Qin Feng instinctively wanted to lead Ran Mo away. But Ran Mo spoke coldly to the person, his face more stern than ever before. “Cannot afford it? I insist on playing today.”

With that, Ran Mo sat down himself.

Lei Yan and the others exchanged looks. But they also understood Ran Mo.

This person was openly degrading the Netherworld Academy. Ran Mo was being stubborn only because he was trying to protect the dignity of the Netherworld Academy. As Wu Fengling’s disciple, the academy’s reputation was naturally more important to him than to anyone else.

The crowd observed Ran Mo’s insistence. They all started to relish the fact that they were about to enjoy a good show.

Ran Mo knew how to play Illusion Beast Chess. Wu Fengling himself had personally taught him.

“Let’s begin,” said Ran Mo.

A smile played at the corners of the person’s lips. He also took out a jade pendant and placed it on the table.

With that, the chess match officially began.

Lei Yan and the others watched on nervously. But Lei Yan’s eyes suddenly brightened after Ran Mo made his move.

“Little Mo Mo’s Illusion Beast Chess is pretty good!”

Lei Yan always believed that his Illusion Beast Chess chess skills were rather good. But after watching Ran Mo’s moves, he realized that Ran Mo’s chess skills were far beyond his.

His anxiety lessened.

Ran Mo’s moves were cautious while his opponent was playing wilfully. But a major change soon occurred on the chessboard.

After just a few rounds, Ran Mo’s chess pieces dwindled until he was only left with his Beast King. Standing all alone on the board, surrounded by his opponents’ pieces which were eyeing it hungrily.

Ran Mo took a deep breath and closed his eyes.

He had lost.

After winning, the person picked up Ran Mo’s jade pendant and casually played with it.

“Thanks.”

Ran Mo stood up without a word as Lei Yan and the others hurried forward.

The person chuckled. “You guys probably still don’t know what this thing is, right?”
