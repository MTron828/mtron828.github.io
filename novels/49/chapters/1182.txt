Chapter 1183: Attack (1)

With a light chuckle, Gu Yu nodded and said, “Miss Ye is right. I do have some solutions in mind.”

“Brother Gu Yu, what solutions do you have?”

The injured elderly asked hurriedly.

“Everyone, although Heaven City’s steep terrains make it easy to defend and hard to attack, it will definitely be invaded in no time if we remain trapped. Everything is only a matter of time,” Gu Yu said.

There was a flurry of discussions after Gu Yu spoke. Everyone was also aware of what Gu Yu said, but there were no good solutions.

“So, we have to attack Dragon Elephant City to solve the root problem… Dragon Elephant City is the main city of their team. If we can make an issue in Dragon Elephant City, the pressing emergency will automatically be resolved,” Gu Yu said with a smile.

“Make an issue in Dragon Elephant City?” Everyone was surprised to hear that. Dragon Elephant City was the headquarters of the troop of the Ancient You Clan army surrounding Heaven City. Wasn’t whoever daring to head to Dragon Elephant city courting death?!

“If we can set a fire in Dragon Elephant City… and burn the rations for this Ancient You Clan troop, they will definitely rush back to Dragon Elephant City… By then, rations can be transported from the headquarters into the city…” Gu Yu smiled. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Mhm, what Brother Gu Yu said is indeed an excellent idea. As long as we can make this troop that encircled Heaven City believe that their headquarters in Dragon Elephant City is attacked, they will rush back immediately!” One of the young powerful figures nodded repeatedly.

“Brother Gu Yu, although the idea is pretty good… the price we have to pay is too great. At least several Yang Lords will have to head to Dragon Elephant City to make it seem that Dragon Elephant City is attacked. However, those Yang Lords would probably lose their lives in Dragon Elephant City then…” The injured elderly commented with a frown.

“There’s no need,” Gu Yu shook his head and said. “We only need to send one Yang Lord and dozens of ordinary soldiers.”

“Do you have anyone in mind then, Brother Gu Yu?” A powerful figure looked at Gu Yu and asked.

This Yang Lord who headed to Dragon Elephant City was highly likely to die, and no one was willing to seek death.

The mission to head to Dragon Elephant City was no different from offering one’s life.

“Brother Gu Yu, do you have any candidates in mind?” The injured elderly asked.

“Yes, I already do.” Gu Yu nodded, and his gaze subsequently landed on Ye Qingtang.

Noticing the situation, someone asked, “Brother Gu Yu, are you planning to let Miss Ye head to Dragon Elephant City?”

“Yes.” Gu Yu nodded and said, “Everyone has witnessed Miss Ye’s skills today. If anyone else headed to Dragon Elephant City, they might not return, but if Miss Ye went instead, there should not be too great of a problem.”

The powerful figures in the hall appeared rather surprised to hear that.

No matter how powerful Ye Qingtang was, it was impossible for her to head to Dragon Elephant City alone and still return unscathed.

However, if Ye Qingtang did not go, they would be the ones who had to head to Dragon Elephant City…

“Everyone, this mission to attack Dragon Elephant City will be handed to Miss Ye. Does anyone have any objections… If anyone thinks that they are more suitable than Miss Ye for this mission, you may come forward as well.” Gu Yu swept a look across the scene and smiled.

However, no one spoke up at this moment as no one wished to go to Dragon Elephant City.
