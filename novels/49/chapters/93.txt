Chapter 94: Xuanling Sect (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Not anyone can enter a sect.” A cold and arrogant voice suddenly traveled into Ye Qingtang’s ears.

Ye Qingtang took a glance towards the direction of the voice, but what followed immediately was a dissipating of warmth in her eyes and a tug up the corners of her lips.

An elegantly-dressed young man overflowing with arrogance was standing a few steps away from Ye Qingtang. Beside him were a few servants waiting upon him carefully.

The person who spoke was Lu Xiuwen, the fifth prince of one of the countries in the Formidable Heavens Dynasty.

The Formidable Heavens Royals were in control of the current dynasty and held a superior position. The Formidable Heavens Dynasty built by them was a magnificent dynasty formed by many countries and commanded by the emperor of the Formidable Heavens Royals. The royal families of each country were all from the Formidable Heavens Royals, and Lu Xiuwen was a prince from one of the many countries in the Formidable Heavens Dynasty. He had a rather high ability and a proud character.

Lu Xiuwen was someone more than “familiar” to Ye Qingtang.

In her previous life when Ye Qingtang entered the sect, she did not have a spirit root, and her cultivation was slow. Then, Lu Xiuwen was rather popular amongst the disciples. Ye Qingtang suffered quite a lot of bullying from him and was even made to do things that only a handyman would do. Furthermore, he did not allow her to focus on cultivation like other normal disciples.

However, Ye Qingtang was not too bothered by all of that.

What really made Ye Qingtang remember Lu Xiuwen was his betrayal.

At that time, Ye Qingtang and Lu Xiuwen were out together to deal with matters but were attacked by a high-level spirit animal on the journey. They were unable to defeat it, and when they almost lost their lives, it was the Heart of the Demon God in Ye Qingtang that unleashed its powers, ultimately saving Lu Xiuwen and the other disciples.

Yet, it was that time when Ye Qingtang’s Heart of the Demon God was completely exposed.

Lu Xiuwen did not take into consideration that she saved his life and simply spread the news all over the world. Not only was Ye Qingtang forced out of Xuanling Sect, but her secret regarding the Heart of the Demon God could no longer be hidden, resulting in the tragedy of being wanted for her life by everyone.

“It’s not up to you to say who can enter and who cannot,” Ye Qingtang scoffed coldly as she looked straight at Lu Xiuwen’s rather good-looking face.

Lu Xiuwen frowned slightly. As a prince, there were rarely people who would rebut him like this. His face sunk immediately, and he swept a gaze at Ye Qingtang, revealing a look of belittlement when he saw that Ye Qingtang was alone.

“A sect is prestigious. Many people want to climb up to it, but they should still have some self-awareness.”

No company by family clan nor send-off from a powerful person. Such an abject person could also come to participate in a sect assessment?

The servants beside Lu Xiuwen obviously echoed Lu Xiuwen and went along with his words continuously.

“Fifth prince, you have a noble identity. Why fight with people like this? Just let those overconfident people be. Then, she’ll know that not just anyone can enter a sect.”

Ye Qingtang raised her brows, and her smile deepened as she looked at the lackeys beside Lu Xiuwen.

“Noble identity? Everyone is equal before the sect. Even if you’re related to the royal family, don’t you still have to wait for the assessment like ordinary people?” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Lu Xiuwen’s slightly better expression suddenly turned ugly again because of Ye Qingtang’s words.

Ye Qingtang did not say anything wrong. Even if he was a noble prince, he still had to participate in the assessment like everyone else, and whether he was able to enter was dependent on his level of talent.

The compliments from the servants earlier on now made Lu Xiuwen a little shameful.

The argument between Ye Qingtang and Lu Xiuwen attracted much attention.

Everyone looked over one after another only to be surprised at their realization: that young girl who was by herself actually got into a conflict with the fifth prince of the Formidable Heavens Royals.
