In the room, Ye Qingtang’s slightly furrowed brows never relaxed.

That day when Ye You and Fu Lingtian met, they vaguely mentioned that there was someone from Yunxiao Sect in Xuanling Sect, and Fu Lingtian mentioned this again today.

Ye Qingtang believed that this was definitely related to the extermination of Xuanling Sect in her previous life!

“Could it be that…” Ye Qingtang’s expression changed slightly.

Given Yunxiao Sect’s prestige, it would never allow a scandal to be brought to light…

If Xuanling Sect discovered that there was a Yunxiao Sect disciple hidden in the sect, Yunxiao Sect would definitely exterminate Xuanling Sect to prevent this matter from being revealed to the public!

In Ye Qingtang’s previous life, Xuanling Sect’s extermination happened about a few years later.

However, this time, because of Fu Lingtian, perhaps… it was accelerated…

If Fu Lingtian did not reveal his true cultivation level in the Three Sect Competition this year, he would not resent her so much to even intrude into her room and attempt to kill her.

After Fu Lingtian’s skills were exposed, Yunxiao Sect would definitely not let him off…

Suddenly, Ye Qingtang’s expression changed. Fu Lingtian deliberately saying that there was also a Yunxiao Sect disciple in Xuanling Sect… must be because he wanted to drag Xuanling Sect down!

Once Xuanling Sect found out who the hidden disciple was… Yunxiao Sect would definitely wipe out Xuanling Sect with wrath!

Yunxiao Sect was one of the influential sects at their peak in the Formidable Heavens Dynasty. To the three sects, it was a colossus—a heavenly mountain that was impossible to surmount.

In the room, Ye Qingtang’s brows frowned tightly. If everything developed according to her guesses, Xuanling Sect’s extermination was already accelerated unknowingly. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“I need to have my martial arts skills break through to Yin Yang True Lord. Otherwise… there’s no way it can be prevented…” Ye Qingtang shut her eyes and was deep in thought.

The so-called Yin Yang True Lord was the realm after Martial Qi Level Three.

Since ancient times, the martial way had been divided into ten realms.

Martial Qi Level One, Martial Qi Level Two, Martial Qi Level Three, Yin Yang True Lord, Arcane Supremacy, Heavenly Venerate, Paragon, Divine Lord, Divine Emperor, and Immortal Emperor!

On this extremely remote mainland, mighty figures at their peak were only at Yin Yang True Lord because of the backward martial culture and the insufficient spirit energy.

Any realm after Yin Yang True Lord had never appeared on this mainland since thousands of years ago.

This world was actually formed by a vast ocean and was coined as the mortal world.

In the primordial mortal world, there were no islands or land and only an ocean where the primordial human civilization lived at the bottom of the sea.

However, tens of thousands of years later, the primordial humans were tired of living in the sea and scattered sacred objects around the ocean, which formed into islands of different sizes.

After attaining the Paragon realm in her previous life, Ye Qingtang’s horizon was widened, and she knew a total of thousands of islands.

Every island was a mainland in the present day.

These islands were later divided into three big domains: Blue Sky Domain, Mixed Heavens Holy Domain, and Divine Venerate Domain.

Amongst the three, there were the least islands in Blue Sky Domain, and its martial culture could not be compared to that of Mixed Heavens Holy Domain and Divine Venerate Domain.

A hundred years later in her previous life, Ye Qingtang once headed to the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain and was shocked by its martial culture.

The skills of the most ordinary sect disciples in Mixed Heavens Holy Domain were far above that of a Yin Yang True Lord!

Even a high-level Arcane Supremacy was very common in Mixed Heavens Holy Domain.

To give an example, if any random ordinary sect disciple in Mixed Heavens Holy Domain came to this mainland, they could easily destroy a colossal Yunxiao Sect just by lifting a hand!
