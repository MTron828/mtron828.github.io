Chapter 1941: Ancient You Clan (2)

There were a few pavilions over there. The middle-aged man went forward and saw a lady standing at the entrance of one of the pavilions. She looked like she was pondering something.

Somewhat startled by the sight of the middle-aged man, she took a quick step forward. “Warden.”

The middle-aged man maintained his cold expression, completely devoid of the earlier respect he had shown the elders. He glanced impatiently at the lady.

“Jiang Qin, did you manage to recall if the Jiang family had any more hiding places in the mainland?”

The lady standing outside the pavilion was indeed Jiang Qin of the Jiang family. She had already lost the arrogance she exuded during her days in the Jiang family. She gazed respectfully and timidly at the middle-aged man.

“I have already written down all the estates owned by the Jiang family, and handed the list over to you.”

“We have gone to all those places but could not find any traces of the Domain Monarch.” The middle-aged man frowned impatiently.

Jiang Qin looked increasingly grim.

“Jiang Qin, if Tuoba Yao had not been wise enough to jump ship to our Ancient You Clan, you would have all already died when we destroyed the Jiang family. I will give you another two days. If you cannot provide any useful leads by then...” The middle-aged man didn’t complete his sentence. But the threat in his tone was evident.

Without waiting for Jiang Qin to respond, the middle-aged man turned and left, leaving Jiang Qin standing there alone, her face pallid with fear.

After the middle-aged man left, the door behind Jiang Qin slowly opened. Ye You and Ye Xun peeked out cautiously from behind the door.

“Aunt Qin...” Ye You looked at the grim-looking Jiang Qin.

Jiang Qin snapped out of her trance.

“Aunt Qin, did the Jiang family really own only those few estates? Have you given it careful thought? The Ancient You Clan is so powerful. Even the Jiang family was not spared. If they wanted our lives, I am afraid...” Ye You bit her lips as she stared at Jiang Qin with deep fear in her eyes.

Jiang Qin’s originally grim face turned an even paler shade of white.

“I know. I already told them everything. The moment we decided to jump ship to the Ancient You Clan, I already planned to serve them wholeheartedly. I even told them about the secret tunnels in the compound for their first attack on the Jiang family...” Jiang Qin furrowed her brows.

No one could ever imagine that there was a traitor in the Jiang family who led to their demise.

And this traitor was the Domain Monarch’s biological daughter and granddaughters. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Now that the Ancient You Clan was so powerful and getting exponentially stronger by the day—the two clans were already long at odds with each other. After Tuoba Yao got news of Jiang Qin’s punishment, he had pleaded with the Domain Monarch to let her out. But the Domain Monarch had refused.

As a result, Tuoba Yao had secretly contacted the Ancient You Clan. Knowing that the Domain Monarch was displeased with Jiang Qin, the couple had shrewdly decided to jump ship over to the Ancient You Clan.

And helping the Ancient You Clan to destroy the Jiang family—this was Jiang Qin’s great present to the Ancient You Clan. A show of her loyalty.

But Jiang Qin had been imprisoned then and could not transmit information. The Ye family was actually the one who had opened the doors of the Jiang family for the Ancient You Clan.

Now that the Jiang family had been destroyed, the Domain Monarch had fled with a group of family members after the major battle. Jiang Qin, Ye You and the rest had immediately sought protection under the Ancient You Clan.

“Aunt Qin, I know you have tried your best, but... you saw clearly what the Ancient You Clan wants.” Ye You pursed her lips.

Jiang Qin’s face became very grave. “Let me see if I can think of other solutions.”
