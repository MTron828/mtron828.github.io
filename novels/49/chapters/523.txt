On this mainland, a sect’s strength was not merely judged based on the skills of the high-ranking executives but more by the heritage passed down from a thousand years ago.

For example, that divine beast was one piece of Yunxiao Sect’s heritage, and even the Yunxiao Sect Sect Master might not be as powerful as this divine beast!

From a certain degree, Yin Yang True Lord already represented an almost unparalleled force!

“Yunxiao Sect… They truly want to exterminate the entire Xuanling Sect…” An internal affairs elder sighed as he looked at the demonic beast which was large enough to cover the entire sky.

Even the divine beast was activated, and Yunxiao Sect’s intention to annihilate Xuanling Sect was extremely clear.

Elder Mo and the rest fell into silence as well. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

In just a while, a scarlet figure appeared.

A scarlet Nine-Tailed Spirit Phoenix arrived slowly. Its eyes were filled with disdain as it glanced across the Xuanling Sect people in the golden formation.

An aloof and arrogant girl stood on the Nine-Tailed Spirit Phoenix.

“Yunxiao Sect’s Ye You…”

A Xuanling Sect warden frowned slightly.

Yunxiao Sect’s Ye You was the Sect Master’s most doted disciple. She possessed an extremely rare martial talent and possessed a blue spirit root. Currently, because her blue spirit root could automatically absorb the spirit energy in the air, her skills had improved extremely quickly.

If Ye Qingtang were present, she would have sensed that the current Ye You had advanced quite a fair bit from when she was on Drifting Cloud Island. Back then on Drifting Cloud Island, Ye You was still at the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three, but in such a short span of time, Ye You’s cultivation base had already entered the early-stage of the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three.

In at most fifteen minutes, more and more demonic beasts that ferried Yunxiao Sect elders and wardens arrived.

On the back of the divine beast stood a young male. He appeared to be a little younger than thirty and had defined features, yet his every movement exuded destructive martial aura.

“Yunxiao Sect’s internal affairs elder… the once number one genius of Yunxiao Sect, Li Chenfeng?!”

Elder Mo looked at that young male and frowned tightly.

Ten years ago, Li Chenfeng was Yunxiao Sect’s number one genius, and ten years on, he had already become Yunxiao Sect’s internal affairs elder. It was evident that Li Chenfeng was no ordinary person.

At that instant, many Yunxiao Sect disciples were standing in the air. There were at least a hundred of them, and every one of them was Yunxiao Sect’s elites whose martial skills were at least at the mid-stage of the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three!

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

Within Xuanling Sect, the sound of the war drums was even more powerful, and every thunderous drum seemed to hit everyone’s heart.

Every Xuanling Sect disciple retrieved weapons and Dharma treasures that they favored from the Treasure Pavilion. Some of the inner sect disciples whose skills were higher wielded black-grade spirit weapons and were burning with fighting spirit.

At this instant, Xuanling Sect faced a calamity, and the Treasure Pavilion was opened up at no charge. Even though the disciples’ skills were not as good as those of Yunxiao Sect disciples, the difference was made up with the divine weapons and Dharma treasures.

In contrast, although Yunxiao Sect disciples were skilled, Yunxiao Sect’s Treasure Pavilion would never be opened to the disciples for free.

“Yunxiao Sect’s envoy is here. Xuanling Sect’s Grand Elder better come out to pay respects quickly!” At that instant, a Yunxiao Sect warden stood in the air proudly as he ordered coldly while overlooking below.

Elder Mo sneered coldly. “Why is the distinguished Yunxiao Sect visiting us?”

“Your Xuanling Sect is so audacious to injure my sect’s disciples. Today, you all must give us, Yunxiao Sect, an explanation,” the Yunxiao Sect warden said.
