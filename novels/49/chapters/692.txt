“Son of a bitch!” The Dragon-Tiger General’s expression changed immediately. “Little bastard, if you dare to touch my son, I will definitely slaughter your entire clan!”

“Really?”

The corner of Ye Qingtang’s lips curled up, and she slowly placed Shangguan Rui on the ground.

Only then did the Dragon-Tiger General’s expression turn a little better.

“Son of a bitch. You’re afraid now?!” Once Shangguan Rui landed on the ground, he pointed at Ye Qingtang and sneered. “This outsider bastard…”

However, before Shangguan Rui finished his sentence, Ye Qingtang had already unsheathed the Demonic Blood Sword.

Swoosh!

The Demonic Blood Sword waved, and a blood-colored sword shadow flashed by.

The crowd was astounded and in disbelief as they watched the smile on Shangguan Rui’s face freeze completely.

A large skull was separated from the body and flew into the sky.

At his very last moment of consciousness, Shangguan Rui’s head was in the air as he was horrified to see his headless body that was spouting blood at the neck area.

Swoosh!

Ye Qingtang waved the Demonic Blood Sword once again.

With a “boom,” Shangguan Rui’s skull was slashed into pieces by the sword shadow.

Everyone at the scene was dead silent.

No one could think that an outsider actually had the guts to chop off Shangguan Rui’s head!

And it was even done right in front of Shangguan Rui’s father, the Dragon-Tiger General!

“My son…!!” At that instant, the Dragon-Tiger General felt his heart rip apart. Grief etched on his face.

“Dirtied my sword.” Ye Qingtang sneered and flicked her wrist, flicking all the blood off the Demonic Blood Sword.

Shangguan Rui’s headless body staggered for a few steps aimlessly and crashed on the ground

“Ah…”

The blue-haired girl beside Ye Qingtang turned pale instantly.

The slave master’s face was ghastly white. Did this fellow really not want his life anymore? Did he know what he did?!

“I want your clan to be annihilated completely!!” The Dragon-Tiger General hollered in fury.

In the next second, thousands of military cultivators cornered Ye Qingtang.

“F*ck you all. Bullying us when you all outnumber us?” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Upon noticing the situation, the little white tiger scoffed coldly and spout a white flame at the thousand cultivators cornering them.

In the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm, the energy stored in the little white tiger’s body was not yet depleted.

As the white flame was spouted out, dozens of cultivators closest to the little white tiger immediately turned into ashes after coming into contact with the white flame.

“WHAT?!”

The remaining military cultivators were alarmed as they looked at that white flame from the little white tiger, and they retreated backward instinctively.

“Be careful of that spirit animal!”

A general shouted with a deep frown. The white flame from that spirit animal’s mouth was extremely frightening and contained a force of destruction which normal cultivators could not bear at all. As long as one was stained with a trace, he would turn into ashes!

“Spirit animal…” The Dragon-Tiger General stared at the little white tiger that had been dyed into orange and clenched his teeth.

“F*ck you all. See whether I’ll burn you all to death or not.” The little white tiger declared with its chin high up, acting as though he was just second in rank to the Heavens.

Before everyone returned to their senses, a white flame burst out from the little white tiger’s mouth once again.

In an instant, another ten or so people were burnt into nothingness by the white flame.

Everyone trembled at the sight and could only retreat even further away in fear of coming into contact with the white flame.

“This son of a bitch…!!” The Dragon-Tiger General looked at Ye Qingtang with darkened eyes. Did he really think that he could escape his death by relying on the protection of a spirit animal!
