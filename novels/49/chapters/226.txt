There were a few toys in the room. Ye Qingtang took a glance at the toys and pinched the child’s decayed hand. There was something that sparkled across her eyes, and she then turned to leave the place.

When Ye Qingtang just walked out of the Spirit Condensation Mountain Village, she suddenly noticed Wu Zheng standing outside the gate. She had no idea when he came, but he was holding a torch. His handsome face was visible due to the flame.

“Young Sir?” Ye Qingtang raised her brows slightly and stared at Wu Zheng in surprise.

Wu Zheng stepped forward and handed over a napkin to her. His eyesight also landed on Ye Qingtang’s hand that was stained by blood.

“Lady Ye, the blood plague is spreading. You should wipe your hands.”

Ye Qingtang took over the napkin and cleaned her hands.

“Are you not afraid of the blood plague? Why did you still come near to the place?” Ye Qingtang smiled and asked.

Wu Zheng shook his head. He looked towards the Spirit Condensation Mountain Village under the moonlight. “I would be eaten by the wild beasts in the mountain if father did not save me. No matter how he is now, he is still my father. I was adopted and raised in the Spirit Condensation Mountain Village. How can I erase the gratitude?”

Ye Qingtang smiled. She felt curious when she saw his expressionless face.

She did suspect Wu Zheng, as he would benefit from the tragedy the most.

However… she could not see any greed or ambition in the young man’s eyes.

Either Wu Zheng was really innocent or he hid his intentions very well.

“You really value the gratitude, I see. Are you free tonight?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Do you have any orders?” Wu Zheng replied.

Ye Qingtang smiled. “Nothing important. Even though I suspected that there was Duanyuan Grass on the cliff at the back of the Spirit Condensation Mountain Village, I have not seen that with my own eyes, so I can’t confirm that. If you are free, follow me to take a look.”

“Sure.” Wu Zheng did not hesitate at all.

“I shall lead the way.” Wu Zheng walked to the front.

Wu Zheng did not put up any guard. Ye Qingtang smiled and followed up.

Under the moonlight, the two shadows walked towards the cliff at the back of the Spirit Condensation Mountain Village.

The sky was completely dark. The moonlight shone on the insignificant flowers at the side of the cliff. The green grass was swinging in the wind, and the wind howled under the cliff.

Ye Qingtang stood at the side of the cliff and scanned through the views at the bottom of the cliff. She was soon attracted by a huge stone. On top of the huge stone, there was a small broken stone tablet.

The stone tablet seemed to be there for quite a long time and was exposed to rain and wind. The words on the tablet were rubbed off.

Wu Zheng was only a few steps behind Ye Qingtang. She was standing at the edge of the cliff. A light push would make her fall into the cliff.

Wu Zheng squinted his eyes, and his face was seen under the moonlight and the flame. The innocent and pure face was now replaced by an expression of malice. He lifted his feet slowly and stepped on the soft grass, walking towards Ye Qingtang step by step.

His footstep was so light that it could be covered by the sound of the wind, but that little sound was still captured by Ye Qingtang.

There was a shade of light sparkling through her eyes. She pretended to not notice anything and continued looking at the bottom of the cliff.
