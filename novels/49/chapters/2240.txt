Everyone was shocked by the sudden voice. They instinctively turned toward the source.

Only to see...

A massive black figure had appeared somewhere at the mountain peak. The figure was pitch-black. The surrounding plants were not at all impacted as it passed.

A strange aura spread across the entire mountain.

Seeing the ominous figure, the hairs on Peng Ji stood on end the moment he felt that aura.

No one else at present knew that aura better than him.

This was the aura which he and his Spy Cloud team had encountered not long ago, and he was the only one left alive..

“Night Soul Beast! It’s that Night Soul Beast!” Peng Ji cried out in terror.

Everyone’s expressions immediately shifted.

“Night Soul Beast? Aren’t the Night Soul Beasts in hibernation? Why did one appear here?”

But after that black mass gradually descended the mountain and landed before everyone’s eyes, they all instinctively held their breaths.

Wasn’t this black mass, so colossal that it looked like it could swallow this entire mountain, the legendary, fearsome Night Soul Beast?!

At that moment, everyone’s faces were extremely grim.

This Night Soul Beast was bigger than all the ones that they had heard of in the legends!

Everyone went on high alert.

They had all heard stories of how vicious the Night Soul Beast was. They had only dared to invade the Evil Soul Forest this time because the Night Soul Beasts were supposed to be in hibernation.

But...

“Someone is riding on the back of the Night Soul Beast!” A person suddenly spied a figure on the back of the Night Soul Beast.

A figure dressed in a black robe could be clearly seen standing on the back of the Night Soul Beast.

“How is that possible?” Everyone was stunned.

The Night Soul Beast were guardians of the Evil Soul Forest. They were born from the remnants of the divine consciousness of the fiendcelestial, as well as the resentment from millions of perished souls. Its goal was to kill every single living creature who stepped into the Evil Soul Forest.

But now...

A human-looking fellow was standing on top of the Night Soul Beast’s back.

What was going on?

Everyone was bewildered.

More than remnants of fear arose in the hearts of the crowd, and that formless fear morphed into slivers of energy, entering the Night Soul Beast’s body.

What a marvelous taste!

The Night Soul Beast savored this familiar taste of fear. Nourished by it, its power continued to grow.

Ye Qingtang stood on the back of the Night Soul Beast, garbed in a black robe with her face covered by a mask. She knew very well that the Night Soul Beast beneath her feet was continuously absorbing the fear and unease radiating from the various factions.

The demon child was taken aback by the sight of the Night Soul Beast and Ye Qingtang.

Who didn’t know that the Night Soul Beast was a ferocious being that submitted to no one? But controlled by this black-robed person, it didn’t immediately charge forward to attack them.

That massive beast was now obediently beneath the feet of that black-robed person as if it was following her instructions.

In this world, there was someone who was able to tame and control a Night Soul Beast?

Furthermore...

Such a massive one!

As the Night Soul Beast was too powerful, the demon child was unable to sense just how high the black-robed person’s level was.

Nevertheless...

No one in this world could control a Night Soul Beast.

Just who was this black-robed person?

The demon child and the leaders of other factions exchanged discreet looks. It was clear that the sudden appearance of this black-robed person was now the key focus of everyone’s attention.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com
