Chapter 349: Carrot And Stick Approach (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The Blood Moon Sect’s main cultivation technique was not based on the spirit root, and thus, most of the elixirs they desired thousands of years ago were different from other cultivators. This Source of the Marrow Pill was one of the superior elixirs that they desired.

However, the formula for this pill had been lost for years, and the Blood Moon Sect had spent much effort but was still unable to find its trace even before it was exterminated.

To date, the words ‘Source of the Marrow Pill’ were no longer in one’s knowledge.

Ye Qingtang was only barely over ten years old, how would she know about the Source of the Marrow Pill? And how was she able to have a real Source of the Marrow Pill?

A smile emerged in Ye Qingtang’s eyes as she looked at the Blood Moon Sect Elder, who tried to maintain his composure.

In her previous life, Ye You led a group of people to try to take Ye Qingtang’s life for many years, and Ye Qingtang was forced into hiding. After an avalanche, a snowfield in the mountains collapsed, and she incidentally found a tomb that was covered with dust for thousands of years. In the tomb buried unimaginable medical books and formulas, and Ye Qingtang found the formula for the Source of the Marrow Pill from there.

The Source of the Marrow Pill was not the only formula she found; there were countless of formulas that were highly valued. However, she was found by a group of people after hiding there for a few days. She was unable to defeat them at that time and could only escape hurriedly after taking a brief look.

Thinking about it now, many medical books and ancient formulas on earth had disappeared, but there were many stored in that tomb. It seemed that the owner of that tomb must be extremely formidable.

In her previous life, Ye Qingtang only managed to read a small portion of the books, and her alchemy skills had already reached a considerably high level. If she could finish reading all of them…

Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes. The location of that tomb was still vivid in her memory, and she must make a trip there again this lifetime.

If she did not remember wrongly, the avalanche would happen a year later, and afterward, that tomb would be discovered, and the person who stole the treasures was powerful. She must quickly raise her skills within a year; otherwise, she would not have the ability to compete with that person at that time.

Ye Qingtang still remembered how powerful that person became after obtaining the treasures in the tomb. If those items fell in her hands, it would undoubtedly be an additional, huge bargaining chip for her.

At that thought, Ye Qingtang stopped recollecting and looked at the doubtful Blood Moon Sect Elder Elder. “I refined it myself. Is there any problem?”

The Blood Moon Sect Elder looked at Ye Qingtang in disbelief.

She refined it herself?

If she knew how to refine the Source of the Marrow Pill, wouldn’t he be able to fly up to the sky?

“You don’t believe me?” Ye Qingtang raised a brow.

“Do you think I believe you?” The Blood Moon Sect Elder asked. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ye Qingtang shrugged slightly. “Won’t you know whether to believe me or not after you try it? Or should I say that you, a Blood Moon Sect Elder, have never seen the real Source of the Marrow Pill?”

“…” The Blood Moon Sect Elder’s face darkened.

He had seen the Source of the Marrow Pill before, but it was only once. That pill was obtained by the Sect Master of the Blood Moon Sect after much effort, and there was only one such pill. As an elder, he could only see it.

Perhaps agitated by Ye Qingtang, the Blood Moon Sect Elder took over the bottle snappily and opened it.

As the bottle was opened, a dark red pill rolled into his palm, and a faint smell of blood traveled into his nose.

All it took was a moment for the Blood Moon Sect Elder to be alarmed.
