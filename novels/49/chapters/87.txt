Chapter 88: Heartwarming (1)

Whatever happened during the birthday banquet at the Ye household spread quickly through the City of Lin.

When morning came, Ye Qingtang visited the Si household, to give thanks to Old Master Si for inviting Mu Su.

“I’ve heard all that’s happened yesterday at your place. That Great Elder sure got what he deserved.” Old Master Si chortled and slapped his thigh while seated.

Ye Qingtang returned a smile.

“And did you manage to convince his lordship to refer you for the entry examination?” Old Master Si asked after regaining his composure.

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang answered frankly.

Old Master Si had a look of concern.

“Your determination to join the Exalted is commendable. I’m aware you’re desperate to overcome all those humiliations you were put through, but joining an Exalted clan is never easy. If you failed the examinations, you’ll lose your only chance in a lifetime. You’re just getting started and attempting it so soon will certainly be a struggle.” Old Master Si paused for a moment, before he emphasized: “Si Ye and Si Qiong are still currently training with their master and they too will attempt the examinations, but only in a few years’ time. Si Bai has the best spirit root amongst his brothers and I’ve intended for him to join the Exalted as well, but only after he has recuperated to a certain extent.”

“Now that the Great Elder has lost his foothold, with your father and Second Elder in charge, why don’t you wait for another year? You can join Si Bai in the meantime for training. I’ll discuss this with your father and we’ll invite the best masters available to train the both of you. Once you’re better prepared, you’ll have a better chance of passing the examinations next year.”

From his words, one could tell Old Master Si had spared no effort in his considerations for Ye Qingtang’s well-being.

Ye Qingtang was nearly moved to tears, however, she shook her head slowly in the end.

“I’m sorry Grandpa Si, I can’t afford to wait for that long. No worries, I would never take risks without being properly prepared.”

“You’re one stubborn kid.” Though Old Master Si grumbled, he remained deeply concerned.

“I’m aware Ye You is your main concern now and you’re adamant on getting your revenge, but there are always the hazards of rushing. Remember, slow and steady wins the race.”

“I know that, and I know you’ve my best interests at heart, but please take my word for it this time.” Ye Qingtang looked Old Master Si straight in the eye while she voiced her earnestness.

“You…” Old Master Si was determined to persuade her again.

But Si Bai, who was seated nearby, interrupted him. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Grandpa, you’re worrying too much. Did Tang Tang ever fail your expectations? Since she’s going to join Xuan Ling’s clan, I’m sure she’s well prepared.”

Old Master Si gave him a glare.

Si Bai could only look away and rub his nose, not knowing whether to laugh or cry at losing out on Old Master Si’s adoration, ever since Ye Qingtang had become a welcomed guest.

“You’re just a greenhorn, blindly accepting whatever she said.” Old Master Si chided Si Bai before he turned his attention back to Ye Qingtang. “Since you’ve decided, I won’t stop you. But promise me one thing.”

“I’m all ears.”

“Before your showdown with Ye You, never, ever let anyone find out that she mugged your spirit root.” Old Master Si advised gravely.

Ye Qingtang faltered for a moment, before she concurred in the next instant: “I understand.”

She had not revealed that to her father or uncle as well. Aside from not wanting them to worry too much about her, preventing them from retaliating unnecessarily was another concern, especially given her uncle’s temper.

“I’m glad you understand. Now that Ye You’s already a disciple of the Cloud-breaker’s sovereign, even if you’ve exposed her wrongdoings, the Cloud-breakers will be certain to cover them up in order to protect their clan’s name, and the most certain way is to eliminate you.” Old Master Si warned morosely, after careful consideration.
