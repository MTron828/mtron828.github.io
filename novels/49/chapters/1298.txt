Chapter 1299: Dangers Abound (1)

Shortly thereafter, the severely injured Mo Yunxian was “invited” to leave the main hall.

The Eternal Emperor took a deep breath and said, “Everyone, arise.”

It was only then that everyone dared to resume their seats.

“Our guests from the Temple of Shadows have not enjoyed themselves because I have not arranged things properly,” the Eternal Emperor said as he looked at Lady Ghost. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Lady Ghost smiled without saying anything.

The disturbance caused by Mo Yunxian had left everyone speechless. They lost interest in the banquet and left quickly.

For many of them, it would be a sleepless night.

At the residence of the Eldest Prince.

“I did not expect our Royal Father to make Ling Yan the Crown Prince.” The Eldest Princess was sitting on a chair looking subdued.

The Eldest Prince wrinkled his brow in deep thought.

Ling Yan becoming the Crown Prince had been a surprise. He had assumed that the arrival of the ambassadors from the Temple of Shadows would improve his chances, but in the end, Ling Yan had become the Crown Prince.

“Today has been hard on Elder Ye. I hope Elder Ye will not take it to heart. It is my fault for being unprepared.” The Eldest Prince did not mention the matter of Ling Yan being made Crown Prince but raised his head to look apologetically at Ye Qingtang, who was sitting in the hall.

At this, the Eldest Princess also snapped out of her trance.

It was a fact that Ling Yan had been made Crown Prince. However, the Crown Prince was just a Crown Prince. They still had a chance before he became the Emperor. In fact, the Temple of Shadows was now even more important to them.

“This Mo Yunxian is really spoiled. Does she really think her Mo Family is the most important in the capital? Our Royal Father clearly showed his partiality to Ling Yan today. Mo Yunxian is Ling Yan’s fiancée. If she were to be severely punished, Ling Yan would certainly be implicated. But our Royal Father did not show any clear intention of punishing her… sigh…” The Eldest Princess sighed while she observed the reaction of the group from the Temple of Shadows from the corner of her eye.

Ye Qingtang was not stupid. She could read between the lines of what the Eldest Prince and Princess were saying.

The Temple of Shadows was supporting the Eldest Prince. The Eldest Prince and Princess were probably delighted that Ling Yan’s “fiancée” had clashed with Ye Qingtang.

The more Ling Yan’s side offended the Temple of Shadows, the greater the Eldest Prince’s advantage.

“I thought that after our Fourth Royal Brother passed away, there would be much delay in deciding on the next Crown Prince. I did not expect our Royal Father to make a decision so quickly,” the Eldest Prince said with a frown.

Lady Ghost looked at the gloomy Eldest Prince and Princess and said, “The Crown Prince is only a Crown Prince, like the Fourth Prince was. The position of Crown Prince can be held by many. But only the last person to be Crown Prince will be the next Emperor of the Eternal Dynasty. Am I right?”

Lady Ghost’s words moved the Eldest Prince, and his brow smoothed out.

“Guardian Lady Ghost is right. It doesn’t matter who the Crown Prince is. What is most important is whether the person in the position of Crown Prince is fortunate enough to survive until he can ascend to the throne.”

“I’m glad that the Eldest Prince understands that. I’ve heard that the Third Prince Ling Yan’s martial ability is not very great. Even the late Fourth Prince was much more talented than him. However, even the Fourth Prince has passed away suddenly, so what chance does Ling Yan have?” Lady Ghost’s lips curved slightly as her eyes flickered.

“Why doesn’t the Eldest Prince use his time to consider how Ling Yan can be induced to leave the position of Crown Prince?”

“Thank you for your guidance.” The Eldest Prince cupped his hands. Although nothing concrete had been said, everyone present was smart enough to understand what had been implied.
