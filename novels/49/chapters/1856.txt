Chapter 1857: Trap (3)

When Ye Qingtang pulled the strand of hair, the dices started moving too.

At that moment...

They finally figured everything out.

“You used a strand of hair to change the score?” Baili Xi’s eyes widened in shock.

Ye Qingtang nodded.

“Yes, so... you can go ahead and just try it out with these spirit stones.”

“...” Their expressions turned complicated.

When did Ye Qingtang come up with this idea? How could they not have realized anything?

At that moment, they finally realized that the fat catfish suffered a miserable loss and it didn’t even know it had been duped!

Ye Qingtang had clearly been playing dumb. The fat catfish had fixated its attention on whether they used spirit energy. No one knew that Ye Qingtang turned the tide using... a strand of hair.

No wonder she agreed to the bet with the fat catfish.

She was already prepared!

“Miss Ye is indeed intelligent.” Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo were genuinely impressed with Ye Qingtang for coming up with such an ingenious idea in such a short period of time.

She certainly wasn’t the newcomer she appeared to be. She was very experienced.

Ye Qingtang smiled without saying anything. Technically, she hadn’t lied to the fat catfish earlier on.

It was true that she hadn’t gambled before ‘this lifetime’.

But that didn’t mean that she hadn’t done it in her previous lifetime. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

She had lived three hundred years in her previous life and was constantly forced to flee for her life, hiding in different places throughout the years.

She had witnessed much more than young masters like Mu Feiruo, who only focused on cultivation.

With Ye Qingtang’s trick, Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo finally took the spirit stones from Ye Qingtang. They thought to themselves that they would return the winnings to Ye Qingtang later.

As for Jiang Shaobai, he looked at Ye Qingtang with a wide smile on his face. He was the only one who wasn’t worried about her at all.

“Sister Qing is indeed formidable.”

Ye Qingtang raised her brows as she looked at Jiang Shaobai’s hand that was about to approach her. She instantly hit it away.

With Ye Qingtang’s pointers, Baili Xi and the rest finally had some confidence and they walked towards the gambling town together.

Groups of fat catfishes gathered in the gambling town. They all had similar appearances, the only difference was in the color and print of their bodies.

Some of the fat catfishes had larger physiques, with big and round stomachs but others were of a smaller physique.

Ye Qingtang had previously noticed that the fat catfish they encountered took everything out from its stomach so they must have an enormous storage space in their stomachs.

They acted separately, wanting to win big. Only Little White Tiger followed Ye Qingtang.

It was odd how the fat catfishes weren’t particularly interested in their arrival, only throwing over a couple of glances before they focused on the bets again.

Recalling the previous fat catfish’s words, there seemed to be quite a number of humans visiting this mystic realm so they probably weren’t surprised by the arrival of humans at all.

Ye Qingtang looked around the various groups of fat catfishes before she finally spotted the fattest fat catfish in the room.

The fat catfish stood beside a huge tree, with other fat catfishes surrounding it. They were all intensely invested in some strange bets.
