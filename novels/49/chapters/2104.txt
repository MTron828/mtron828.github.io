Chapter 2105: Knowing Beforehand (2)

There were many changes and developments in martial arts, but one thing remained constant.

The foundational skills.

No matter how much time had passed, the basic foundation was the most important and most deep-rooted skill to possess. No one could change the foundational skills. One’s foundation would have a large impact on future cultivation

It was precisely because of this that the Clan of Winged People was troubled for many years.

At that moment, everyone fell silent.

“To think that a young lady from the First Domain easily resolved a problem that troubled the Clan of Winged People for so many years. Do all of you really think that she’s just an ordinary young lady?” A voice came from one of the portraits hanging on the wall.

These words struck everyone.

“We all know how backward the First Domain is. Moreover, this young lady said that she’s from the First Mainland. That’s the most backward place in the entire First Domain. How long has she been in the Central Mainland? How could she know so much just by interacting with those alien races for such a short time?”

“Even if she grew up in the Central Mainland, she couldn’t possibly know all of that at this young age.”

Everyone started discussing once they heard those words. Their hearts palpated at Ye Qingtang’s capabilities.

“It’s impossible that she’s just an ordinary young lady. Even in the Second Domain, who would know as much as her?” Elder Hua’s brows lifted. “I think that the Fox Demon Elder is right. Other than our Holy Lord, who else knew this much about martial arts?”

Elder Hua retracted her gaze. She looked at Ye Qingtang in the crystal ball with admiration.

“Our Holy Lord is deserving of her title. Even when reincarnated as a human, she remains an elite.”

“If she’s really our reincarnated Holy Lord, why isn’t she admitting it? Since she remembers martial arts, why can’t she remember her identity?” Someone questioned.

“You think that our Holy Lord needs memories to know all of that? Even with everything wiped out, it isn’t difficult for our Holy Lord to start afresh and know all of that with her powers,” Elder Hua said.

Elder Hua’s words made the elders immerse in thoughts. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

No one would deny the Holy Lord’s powers and intelligence.

...

On the Floating Island. Ye Qingtang had no idea that her every move was being watched by everyone at the Temple of Paragon.

As she looked at the little winged child, he brightened her spirits.

If only the Heart of the Heavenly Dao in her body wasn’t threatening her survival, she would want to find a quiet place with good scenery and just lead a peaceful life. If she were to have a child, he or she must be this adorable...

Somehow, when she thought about children, Ling Yan’s face suddenly flashed past her mind.

Ye Qingtang was astonished at that moment.

“...”

What in the world? She didn’t want a son like Ling Yan!

“Thank you!” The little winged person seemed to not have noticed her abnormality and thanked her.

Ye Qingtang pulled herself together and shook her head to get that ridiculousness out of her mind. Getting up, she prepared to walk around when she suddenly noticed...

More little children appeared behind her.

The little alien race children looked at Ye Qingtang with expectation.

Ye Qingtang was speechless.

What were they planning to do?!

“Could you please help me too? I can’t transform...” They looked at Ye Qingtang pitifully with their furry ears sticking out.
