Chapter 2257: Escape (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Everyone was stunned by his words. In the next moment, they reassessed their surroundings. Although the scene remained the same, the earlier fiendcelestial energy had completely disappeared.

“This was all an illusion… there is no fiendcelestial’s will. There’s something wrong with that black-robed person.” The demon child narrowed his eyes.

As the most powerful, he was the first to realize something was wrong.

Even so, he had also been duped.

On the other side, Ye Qingtang led the teenagers through the darkness. Suddenly, a faint glow appeared before them.

.

“What’s that?” Lei Yan asked timidly.

Ye Qingtang didn’t reply but only stepped forward. In the murky darkness, a glowing river had appeared before them. Black figures danced upon the surface of the water. Ye Qingtang had to lean closer to see clearly.

Those black figures were monsters.

The monsters had bat-like wings, but their bodies were similar to those evil demon statues on the Matrix Path, just much smaller. Those flying evil demons held all sorts of weapons, their eyes radiating with a pale blue light.

Moments later, Lei Yan and the others caught up and saw those flying evil demons. Their faces instantly turned grim.

Suddenly, an alluring singing voice drifted over.

The song was melodious and filled with a woman’s charm. It sounded like it was coming from afar, but gradually approaching.

“Who is singing?!” Qin Feng frowned.

Ye Qingtang looked toward the surface of the water. Lit by the light, several blurry figures slowly appeared beneath the surface of the water.

Nervous, Lei Yan and the rest took a step backward, keeping their eyes fixed upon the water.

The sound of water accompanied the singing. The song seemed to possess a strange power. It felt like it could dispel all fears. As the singing continued, the formerly frightened teenagers suddenly took a step toward the water.

Amidst the darkness, light shone out of the water, as if a star had dropped into the water.

A beautiful figure had quietly swum to the side of the river. She had a gorgeous face with exquisite, flawless features. But faint scales grew on the sides of her cheeks.

The beautiful woman popped her head out of the water, her lustrous long hair cascading down onto her pristine shoulders. Those deep blue eyes sparkled as that melodious voice came out from between her slightly-parted red lips. It was like the sound of nature itself.

Qin Feng was bewitched.

There were plenty of beautiful women in the world, and Qin Feng had always felt that he would never be bewitched by a woman’s looks. But now, all he could see was this gorgeous lady.

Somehow, he was now bent over and the woman in the water reached out one slender, fair arm, gently caressing Qin Feng’s cheek. She seemed to be smiling, with her eyes as intoxicating as the finest wines.

“Qin Feng!” Ye Qingtang’s voice suddenly rang out beside his ear. Shocked, Qin Feng realized that he was now kneeling by the river, and the woman’s arms were looped around his neck.

Qin Feng was just one arm’s length away from falling into the water. Before Qin Feng realized what was happening, Ye Qingtang suddenly reached out to drag him away.

Just as she did so, she felt a powerful force and the beautiful woman’s face twisted.
