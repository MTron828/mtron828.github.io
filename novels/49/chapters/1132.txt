Chapter 1133: This Is Impossible (2)

Before Ye Qingtang could speak, Han Cangming’s body flashed by, and he grabbed the Blood Moon Holy Lord’s shoulder from the back before hurling him several hundred meters away.

“Are you very anxious?” Han Cangming looked at the Blood Moon Holy Lord and asked.

Blood Moon Holy Lord floated in the air and replied coldly. “We can continue slowly after I deal with her.”

Han Cangming did not utter a word and rammed his fist towards the Blood Moon Holy Lord.

Seeing that he could not get pass Han Cangming, the Blood Moon Holy Lord could only accept the battle.

Boom Boom!! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Boom! Boom!

Deafening explosions filled the air as though a calamity was impending. Two shadows—one red and one white—interlaced and created ripples in the air.

“Holy Lady… quickly leave!”

Blood Moon Elder immediately grabbed Ye Qingtang and dashed forward.

However, before they could run far, a virtual image of an elderly appeared before them.

The appearance of that elderly was exactly the same as the Blood Moon Elder’s original looks!

“You…”

The Blood Moon Elder was stunned when he saw the elderly who looked exactly the same as his original self.

“Have you forgotten your mission?”

The elderly asked coldly. It was as though his voice penetrated through the Netherworld and reached them.

“Who are you… Why do you look like me?!” Blood Moon Elder asked furiously.

“Who am I?” The virtual elderly snickered. “You’re merely a split self of me. Why? Did you even forget about this?”

Blood Moon Elder shuddered when he heard what the elderly said, and disbelief filled his eyes.

What was this person saying…

He actually said that he was only a split self…

Even Ye Qingtang was stunned.

“Your existence is to be loyal to Blood Moon Holy Lord. Now that you wish to betray the Blood Moon Holy Lord, I’m afraid there’s no need for your existence anymore…” The virtual elderly said without emotions.

Ye Qingtang sized up the virtual elderly in the air and frowned slightly.

This image of the elderly was formed using pure mental energy. His original self should be far away, and he used mental energy to enter this place…

However, to possess such frightening mental energy and be able to execute a remarkable skill that crossed space, this elderly’s true cultivation base was at least… above the Heavenly Venerate realm. It was even possible he was even a Holy Venerate…

“I am your split self… Who are you kidding!”

Blood Moon Elder stared at the virtual elderly in the air and shouted furiously.

He was no one but himself, a real and existing independent body. How could he be someone else’s split self?!

“Oh?”

After hearing what the Blood Moon Elder said, the virtual elderly snickered. “Since you’re so sure that you are not a split self, do you… have any memories from when you were young?”

“This…”

Blood Moon Elder was shocked, and he tried his best to recall his youth… but to no avail, as though he had no youth at all.

“Haha… no wonder. You have already died once, and your true memories should be forgotten already… Since that’s the case, let me help you to recall your identity.”

As the virtual elderly finished his sentence, endless mental energy immediately enshrouded the Blood Moon Elder.

Many scenes appeared in the Blood Moon Elder’s mind almost instantly.

The Blood Moon Elder was astonished. He finally recalled his identity.

Just as what that virtual elderly had said, the Blood Moon Elder was actually really just a split self of that elderly.
