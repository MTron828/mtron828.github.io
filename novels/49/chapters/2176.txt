Ye Qing walked over to the ice. Taking out a matchstick, he lit it before placing it on top of the ice.

The ice started melting under the high temperature of the fire. He stepped back and after a while, the ice completely melted into water.

Like that, he easily resolved it without using any spirit energy or any moves.

Lei Yan couldn’t hear the sounds outside and when he saw that Ye Qing had melted his life-saving ice, he screamed.

“Boss, what are you doing?! It’s only eight moves. There are two more moves!” Lei Yan ran away to stand as far as possible from Ye Qing. He thought that Ye Qing had counted wrongly.

“Qin Feng, this is not counted! Boss did this. Wait for me, I’ll freeze myself again before I take the remaining two moves!” Lei Yan puffed his cheeks up, preparing to freeze himself again.

Before Ye Qing could do anything, Lei Yan froze himself again.

She was speechless.

This brat clearly had no brain!

“You used only fire to melt the glacier?” Qin Feng questioned Ye Qing with knitted brows. That seemed impossible.

“If you’re not convinced, use a matchstick and try it out for yourself,” Ye Qing replied.

Qin Feng was skeptical but he walked over to Lei Yan and lit a matchstick.

The glacier started melting when it came into contact with the fire.

Lei Yan was shocked.

“Qin Feng, you’re shameless! How could you copy Boss!”

After being scolded by the aggrieved Lei Yan, Qin Feng was speechless.

“Boss, this fellow has found a way to counter me. Teach me two more moves!” Lei Yan hollered. Boss’ method was pretty useful.

“There’s no need for that.” Ye Qing sighed. She had to find some way to improve his intelligence, if not, he’ll probably die because of his stupidity.

Lei Yan was confused.

“You’re indeed more powerful than Lei Yan, but it’s precisely because of the power disparity that made you too reliant on your power.”

Ye Qingtang was honest with Qin Feng. It was impossible for her to train the foolish Lei Yan to become skillful enough to confront Qin Feng with ten moves in just ten days. However... that didn’t mean that she couldn’t train Lei Yan just enough to just take in ten moves from Qin Feng.

Qin Feng was overconfident. He only knew how to attack without carefully thinking about it when Lei Yan used such unorthodox methods.

Ye Qingtang had extensive experience in battling those who were stronger than her in her previous lifetime. No one knew better than her that tactfulness was critical in battling stronger opponents.

Psychological warfare was critical as well.

Qin Feng kept quiet for a moment. “Teacher Ye, I’ll go to class tomorrow.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

It didn’t feel good to lose, but Qin Feng realized some problems over this process. He didn’t resonate with Ye Qing’s little antics. However, he would still stick to his promise and attend Ye Qing’s lessons.

Anyway, he wouldn’t be able to stay in the Netherworld Academy any longer. It didn’t matter after all.

Qin Feng turned around to leave right after saying those words.

He left before Lei Yan could even process everything. He scratched his head and asked, “Boss, what happened? He just admitted defeat like that?”

“He’s scared that your brains will turn bad if you continue freezing yourself,” Ye Qing replied.

He was already this dumb, if he continued, wouldn’t he truly become a fool?

Lei Yan, “...”.

When did Qin Feng become this thoughtful?
