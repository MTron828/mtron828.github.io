Chapter 1734: Attack From Both Sides (2)

“Wuuu...” Little Heavenly Demon sat down firmly with its cheeks bulging so much that it had to hold them with its paws. A tuft of Little White Tiger’s fur was still lodged in one of its claws.

Little White Tiger, “...”

Damn, if not for the fact that it couldn’t defeat this Heavenly Demon, Little White Tiger would already have tossed that little punk onto the floor and stomped on it for tugging on its fur!

Ye Qingtang felt both amused and exasperated at little Heavenly Demon’s clingy behavior. She held it tightly before patting Little White Tiger, indicating that it should start moving.

Grumbling somewhat, Little White Tiger finally started to move after a bit of reluctance.

Their journey was relatively calm and peaceful. Ye Qingtang observed several mid-sized monsters eyeing them from the sides. They all paused before scurrying away. Those monsters must have detected little Heavenly Demon’s demon aura.

Somehow, the greedy little Heavenly Demon had become their protector. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

But its appetite was astounding. Mountains of food had already been stuffed into its belly, but it remained unsatiated. It kept staring piteously at Ye Qingtang, which induced her to subconsciously reach into her space ring. By now, her supply of food was nearing the bottom...

Just as Ye Qingtang was still quietly marvelling at little Heavenly Demon’s appetite, there was a tremor in the valley in front of them. Countless shards of ice scattered down from the mountain tops and some of them landed on little Heavenly Demon’s nose. Curious, it licked at them but then frowned at the chilly feeling.

“Roar!!”

An earth-shattering beastly howl suddenly echoed through the valley.

Ye Qingtang’s brows furrowed. She could clearly feel a powerful aura emanating from behind those ice mountains. It was a mighty force and the nearer they were, the more clearly she could feel it.

Ye Qingtang was about to get Little White Tiger to make a detour but just as they switched directions, a huge shadow stood up from behind that ice mountain.

It was a giant humanoid beast with an ugly face and rotting boils covering its entire body. Even from a distance, they could smell the evil stench it exuded.

“Troll...” Ye Qingtang’s eyes widened when she saw this monster which was even bigger than an ice mountain.

Some time in the past, Ye Qingtang had seen this type of monster once. It was during her earlier visit to the two star constellation. But she had just seen a picture of it then, and had never witnessed one in real life.

Even within the two star constellation, trolls were monsters which only existed in legends. They had been extinct for thousands of years.

However...

Why was there a troll here now?

Ye Qingtang was very puzzled, but it was not the time now to ponder such mysteries. The troll was one of the strongest and mightiest monsters. Even the hardest rock would crumble like soft tofu in its hands. In addition, trolls were naturally violent and combative...

At this point, the troll was standing at full height. It took one leisurely step and completely flattened the ice mountain right in front of Ye Qingtang’s very eyes.

Countless ice shards scattered in all directions and accumulated snow gushed out like ocean waves.

Little White Tiger quickly leaped into the air and dodged the impending avalanche. But in doing so, it caught the eye of the troll.

“Roar!!” The troll’s green eyes suddenly discovered Ye Qingtang and the others. Roaring with agitation, it raised a giant axe covered in spikes and charged straight at them!
