Chapter 1646: Island of Immortal Footsteps (1)

The days flew by, and very soon, the twenty youths chosen from Taiyuan Valley were about to depart for the Island of Immortal Footsteps to take part in the Martial Arts Championship.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Since morning, everyone was ready to set off, and the floating ship in the sky was ready to be boarded. Under the elders’ directions, the twenty youths boarded the ship successively and began their journey to the Island of Immortal Footsteps.

Various clans had set sail as well.

The Island of Immortal Footsteps floated above the dangerous waters and was inaccessible using any sea routes. Only by taking the floating boat would people be able to cross the seas and arrive at the place.

As the Martial Arts Championship drew near, the sky above the Island of Immortal Footsteps was docked with the floating ships of various clans.

The owner of the Island of Immortal Footsteps was a mystery, and barely anyone was aware of his identity to date.

When the Jiang Family’s floating ship arrived at the Island of Immortal Footsteps, the youths on the ship could not hold themselves back from looking at the island that was surrounded by many clouds. It was their first time to step into this battleground of the ancient clans.

Once the floating ship docked, everyone alighted successively.

Ye Qingtang gazed at the Island of Immortal Footsteps before her. In both lifetimes, this was the first time she came here.

Jiang Shaobai was beside Ye Qingtang, but she seemed to be uninterested in everything here. After stretching her body, she clung onto Ye Qingtang as she poked the little white tiger’s bottom every now and then.

“...”

F*ck you! Shameless!

Various clans had already arrived at the Island of Immortal Footsteps, and these top-tier clans of the Central Mainland led the most outstanding youths of their clans to assemble.

Elder Qian and the other Jiang Family elders were getting in touch with islanders when an enormous and elegant floating ship docked in the skies, and a group of youths in gorgeous outfits flew down from the floating ship.

“It’s the Qiu Clan.” Elder Kun mumbled to Elder Qian when he saw the outfit of those people.

Elder Qian nodded slightly, but before he could reply, the elders of the Qiu clan walked over.

“Elder Qian, it’s been a while.” The Qiu Clan elder smiled as his elegant robe glistened in the sunlight and blinded everyone.

Elder Qian gave a light nod politely.

Ye Qingtang’s attention landed on the people of the Qiu clan.

The Qiu Clan was one of the finest ancient clans in the Central Mainland. However, there seemed to be some enmity between the Qiu Clan and the Jiang Family. Back then, there were various top clans and numerous supreme figures in the Central Mainland, and every clan went all out to attain the title of the Domain Monarch.

Back then, the Qiu Clan was one of the strongest opponents of the Jiang Family in contesting for the Domain Monarch position. However, the Domain Monarch Founder was extremely skilled, and he defeated all the top cultivators of the Qiu Clan to secure the position as the Domain Monarch.

Over these few years, the Qiu Clan invested all their efforts in nurturing talented youths and had been showing signs of making a comeback.

As Ye Qingtang’s eyes scanned across the youths of the Qiu Clan, she noticed a beautiful girl who looked down shyly and followed behind an elder. Her behavior resembled that of a budding, frail flower that appeared pitiful in all angles—completely unlike someone who was here to participate in the Martial Arts Championship.

“Elder Qian, I heard that the Jiang Family gained a little extraordinary talent a few years ago. I have not congratulated you on that yet,” Elder Qiu said with a smile. Although it seemed like a compliment, there was no trace of sincerity in his eyes.

“You’re too kind.” Elder Qian replied in a collected manner.
