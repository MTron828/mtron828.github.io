Chapter 1098 Plunder (3)

The middle-aged man in the golden robe kneeled down and snapped the boy’s forehead with his finger.

The boy was pushed backward and fell to the ground.

The man in the golden robe scoffed and grabbed the girl.

“E-I…”

The boy got up suddenly and ran toward the man in golden robe. His eyes were red. He waved his little fist and punched towards the man’s leg

“Little bastard. No wonder you’re the reincarnation of the Luo Xue Demon Lord. Exactly like him.”

The man in the golden robe scoffed and kicked the boy away.

“I have to admit that the little bastard is indeed special. I don’t know how you magically grow on a tree after reincarnation… Your body is so strong without any cultivation at such a young age.” The man in the golden robe laughed coldly.

If he was a normal child, he would not be able to endure the man’s kick at all.

“Jin Gang, take the little bastard as well.” The man in the golden robe gave a command to a strong man behind him.

The strong man of the ancient clan nodded. He stepped forward and grabbed the boy’s hair to pull him up from the ground.

“What do you want! Let go of the two children!”

Perfected Xuanchen and a few Peak Masters walked forward and tried to stop the ancient clan people.

“A bunch of useless idiots!”

The golden-robed man shouted in rage. His strong martial aura suddenly flowed out. Perfected Xuanchen and the rest were forced backward by the aura.

“Humph, you’ll be dead now if there was no presence of the source of the Spiritual Abode here…” The man in the golden robe sneered.

Before Perfected Xuanchen and the rest could say anything, a red shadow suddenly flashed across the air.

Swoosh!

A scarlet gleam rushed into the sky as the sword slashed towards the man in the golden robe.

The man in the golden robe dodged backward when he sensed the threat.

However, the girl in his hand was grabbed away by the scarlet figure instantly.

The scarlet figure hugged the girl and smashed her other hand towards the strong man of the ancient clan at the same time.

The strong man was not able to dodge. He was hit by the hand directly, and the boy in his hand was taken away as well.

The figure then showed herself.

Ye Qingtang was dressed in red and hugged the girl and the boy. She looked towards the man in the golden robe and the rest coldly. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Hidden ancient clan… How majestic… How dare you to bully two children here?!”

“Yang… Lord…”

The few ancient clan figures were a little surprised after sensing Ye Qingtang’s Yang Lord power. They did not expect that there was a Yang Lord in the negligible sect.Furthermore, she must be very powerful to be able to take the two children from their hands.

“E-I…”

The boy was delighted as Ye Qingtang appeared. He grabbed her right hand tightly.

“Be good…”

Ye Qingtang bent down and put down the girl. She handed over the girl to the boy and smiled. “Take care of her.”

“E-I…”

The boy’s eyes sparkled and nodded.

Ye Qingtang stood up. Her red clothes were swaying in the wind. She took a step forward and scanned through the ancient clan figures coldly. “You want to take the two of them away?”
