“Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General, what’re you still doing here?” Ye Qingtang said as she suddenly appeared in front of the Great General after escaping into the twisted space.

After a few days of chaotic battling, the sealed space had come to a standstill. The demons who had been fighting for the Deity Ocean previously suddenly realized that it had already been taken by someone else and there was no trace of it left anywhere.

Many demons had already left the sealed space. The Earth Demon Race’s and Emperor Demon Race’s Great Generals had not given up yet and were still searching for it. Just as they were about to leave, they saw the Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General standing foolishly at the mountain peak, shouting at the air.

Seeing his old rivals approach, the Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General hid the anger from his face and asked, “What? Have you two found the Deity Ocean?”

The two of them had not found it and were going over to see if the Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General had the Deity Ocean, but it seemed like he was empty-handed as well. However, they didn’t leave at once, both of them still suspicious of the Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General. They only started leaving slowly once they realized that there were no traces of the Deity Ocean on him.

“If only. Who knows where the Deity Ocean is now. It seems like the sealed space is about to close, so we’re leaving soon,” the Earth Demon Race’s Great General replied.

The Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General stayed silent as his face remained sullen.

The two other Great Generals found this amusing.

Among the three of them, the one who felt the worst was definitely the Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General, who had the Deity Ocean right in his grasp and let it slip away.

The two other Great General wasted no more time talking and led their underlings off the mountain peak.

The Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General’s heart sank as he saw the other two Great General leave with their demons. He had already roused the other two Great General’s suspicions again. If he didn’t obtain the Deity Ocean soon, troubles were going to follow. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

His already worn-out patience was now mixed with urgency.

When Ye Qingtang appeared in front of the Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General again, he didn’t rush to attack her. The Great General’s inaction only made Ye Qingtang more cautious. She prepared to cross space once again.

“Little rascal.” The Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General suddenly spoke up, but in a gentler voice this time.

“This sealed space is about to close. We’re not going to be able to leave this place if we continue on like this. Since you just want to leave here with your life and I just want the Deity Ocean and don’t have time to mess with you, how about this? As long as you hand the Deity Ocean over to me, I’ll let you leave your life.” The Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General suddenly offered her another option.

Ye Qingtang gave him a surprised expression, as though she was thinking of his offer, but she was crying inside.

Where was she going to get a Deity Ocean for him?

Also...

Ye Qingtang was no fool. She didn’t believe that the Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General was going to let her go after she handed the Deity Ocean over.

But since the Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General wanted to negotiate, she would play along. The power of the Deity Ocean was draining fast and she was glad for any chance to rest.
