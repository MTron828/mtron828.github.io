Chapter 1476 Land of Infinite Demons 5

The moment they arrived at the hall, they saw Jiang Xun’s ugly expression, and an ominous feeling crept into their heart.

“Greetings, fifth great-uncle,” Jiang Lang said.

Jiang Shangyu took a look at Jiang Lang and nodded perfunctorily.

“Second brother, you really must thank fifth great-uncle today.” Jiang Qin chuckled lightly when she saw Jiang Lang. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Jiang Lang was disgusted by Jiang Qin’s behavior.

“Fifth great-uncle is personally leading the team into the Land of Infinite Demons this time. Furthermore, fifth great-uncle said that he will give your Tang Tang a chance to learn from experience and allow her to go to the Land of Infinite Demons together this time.”

“What?” As expected, Jiang Lang’s and Mo Yi’s expressions changed.

Let Ye Qingtang go to the Land of Infinite Demons?

If it was a usual day, Jiang Lang and his wife might think that this was a pretty good decision, but now…

As Jiang Lang looked at Jiang Kai who was standing beside Jiang Shangyu, his heart seemed to be weighed down by a huge stone.

Ye Qingtang, who stood behind Jiang Lang and Mo Yi, looked at the scene and immediately understood everything.

What a great Jiang Qin, what a great Jiang Shun…

Ye Qingtang did hear of Jiang Shangyu’s name before and was aware of his status in the Jiang Family. Now that they requested Jiang Shangyu to make a move through Jiang Kai, Ye Qingtang was extremely clear of their motive.

In the entire Jiang Family, the only people who treated her well was Jiang Lang and Mo Yi. In contrast, Jiang Qin and Jiang Shun hated her to the core, and they were in control of the Land of Infinite Demons expedition this time. It seemed that they were prepared to deal with her from a long time ago.

Ye Qingtang could understand the situation, and so could Jiang Lang.

His expression became increasingly ugly. Jiang Xun noticed that Jiang Lang seemed to be about to act up from aside and was alarmed.

This is bad.

The reason why Jiang Qin called Ye Qingtang over was probably to force Jiang Lang to go against Jiang Shangyu.

If Jiang Lang really offended Jiang Shangyu, even the Domain Monarch would probably reprimand him as well.

Jiang Xun’s face was filled with worry. She wanted to persuade Jiang Lang before he acted up, but a figure stood in front of Jiang Lang before her.

Ye Qingtang suddenly stepped forward and said to Jiang Shangyu, who was seated at the top position, “Thank you for your kindness, great great-uncle. I definitely will not let you down.”

Jiang Lang, who was about to burst out in fury, was taken aback by what Ye Qingtang said.

However, Jiang Qin frowned slightly. But thinking of the Land of Infinite Demons scheme, she did not say anything further.

Jiang Shangyu saw that Ye Qingtang was relatively obedient and nodded slightly. He stood up and left after leaving them with some instructions.

Seeing that Jiang Shangyu left, Jiang Qin and the rest took their leave as well but shot Ye Qingtang and her parents a scornful look before leaving.

“Tang Tang, you cannot go to the Land of Infinite Demons,” Jiang Lang said immediately.

“Father, it is inappropriate if I don’t go since great great-uncle has personally spoken.” Ye Qingtang agreed to it suddenly earlier on as she was worried that Jiang Lang would fall for Jiang Qin’s scheme and get into a conflict with Jiang Shangyu directly.

“But…” Jiang Lang’s brows were tightly furrowed as he was extremely worried for Ye Qingtang’s safety.

“Forget it. I’ll risk it this time. Lang, I will accompany Tang Tang to the Land of Infinite Demons this time. With me around, Jiang Shun and the rest probably will not be able to stir up much trouble.” Jiang Xun sighed. Jiang Kai would not go to the Land of Infinite Demons this time, and if Jiang Xun went, she could still look after Ye Qingtang.
