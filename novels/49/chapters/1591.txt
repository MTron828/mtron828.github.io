Chapter 1592 Allied Forces 2

Ye Qingtang’s brows furrowed slightly as she watched the murderous and bloody scene before her.

This town and the nearby surroundings were still peaceful before night fell. Who could have expected that this place would turn into a hell-like battlefield in just a few hours?

Ye Qingtang walked toward that fierce battlefield slowly. The ferocious soldiers’ eyes were bloodshot as they waved their weapons continuously and chopped the heads of their enemies. Dismembered limbs and corpses were strewn all over the ground as sounds of slaughtering filled the air.

“Ah!!” A sharp cry pierced the night sky. A guard who was soaked in blood had numerous wounds on his body, and his silver armor was completely stained red. A soldier from the allied forces chased after him fiercely as though he was hunting his prey.

That guard looked at most sixteen years old and was still a teenager. He instinctively wanted to avoid the arrival of death, but the fear on his face froze when he saw Ye Qingtang walking toward them from the town.

He could not retreat! Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

If he did, his family and friends would be massacred.

Valor rushed into his chest. His retreating footsteps stopped and changed direction. With a beastly roar and bloodshot eyes, he charged toward the incoming allied force soldier and raised his sword to protect his homeland!

“Run! This is a battlefield. Quickly...” The teen guard shouted with all his might, but the allied force soldier slashed his shoulder in the next second, and blood spewed all over the place.

The remainder of his sentence was replaced by a cry as the teen guard collapsed before Ye Qingtang and stained her pure white dress with his blood.

The bloodthirsty allied forces soldier suddenly saw a girl in strange clothes on the battlefield and noticed that the guard seemed to be protecting her earlier on.

Almost instantly, the allied forces soldier unsheathed his bloody sword, ignored the dying teen guard, and slashed at Ye Qingtang!

Ye Qingtang was slightly surprised, but she remained expressionless as she watched the incoming sword. Suddenly, she lifted her hand, and the heavy sword was trapped between her fingers easily...

The allied forces soldier was filled with astonishment. His sword seemed to be soldered into iron and would not budge an inch.

“Can I kill this?” Ye Qingtang turned to look at the God of Nature.

The God of Nature stopped her when she wanted to attack the people of the Supreme League Kingdom earlier on.

The God of Nature floating behind Ye Qingtang nodded and said, “Of course. They’re the allied forces, the enemy of the Supreme League Kingdom.”

The God of Nature was very knowledgeable about this world.

“Allied forces.” Ye Qingtang mumbled. In all honesty, everyone on this chaotic battlefield was heavily-armored, and she could not tell who was who.

However, the teen in the armor from earlier on seemed to want her to leave this place...

In that case... he should be a soldier of the Supreme League Kingdom.

Ye Qingtang immediately distinguished the two types of armors representing the different camps.

With permission from the God of Nature, Ye Qingtang simply broke the sword without hesitation and thrust it into the enemy soldier’s neck while he was still stunned.

Blood spouted into the sky in a flash.
