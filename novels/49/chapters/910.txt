Chapter 911 Demon-Like Intelligence (4)

“There is a common saying here: once one’s martial skills reach their peak, they can destroy all evil plots. However… everything is relative. Once demonic intelligence reaches a certain level, it can destroy all gods, surpass all Martial Qi, and destroy the heavens in one stroke.” The little azure dragon looked at Ling Yan and shook its head.

At that moment, on a certain mountain ridge.

Ye Qingtang studied her surroundings. The mightiest blow by a Heavenly Venerate had actually dissipated completely.

“Ling Yan’s Karma Diversion…” Ye Qingtang frowned deeply.

“The Heavenly Demon Bloodline?!”

A cold light glinted in the virtual image’s eyes when it sensed the aura emitted by Ye Qingtang. “You are a clansman of the Domain Monarch, Jiang Duantian!”

After hearing what the old man said, Ye Qingtang did not speak but appeared thoughtful.

Perhaps, Ling Yan had used Karma Diversion to move the aura of Ye You’s bloodline to her body. When blended with the aura from the Heavenly Demon Pearl, it had caused the Heavenly Venerate to mistake her for a member of the Jiang Clan…

Ling Yan, oh Ling Yan, how well you have calculated…

She had not thought that Ling Yan would have prepared all this in advance.

However, since Ling Yan had already arranged all this, she did not need to waste these plans.

Ye Qingtang contemplated inwardly.

When he saw that Ye Qingtang did not reply, the old man became even more certain. This girl, who has such a strong aura of the Heavenly Demon Bloodline, must certainly be a member of the Jiang family.

“Our Feng Clan and your Jiang family have always kept clear of each other. Today, you have broken the rules.” The virtual image spoke coldly.

Further, this girl had earlier withstood the force of his scoff. In terms of martial skills, she was at least at the level of a Heavenly Venerate. In the entirety of the Central Mainland, even within the entire First Domain, a Heavenly Venerate with Heavenly Demon bloodlines could only be found in the Jiang family!

Ye Qingtang clearly understood that this virtual image had taken her for a member of the Jiang family. Ye Qingtang naturally did not reveal her status.

In order to hide her true status, she did not even draw her sword. She stepped forward and appeared in front of Feng Wuya.

In a flash, Ye Qingtang gripped Feng Wuya’s neck and lifted him in mid-air.

“Grand… father… save… save… me…”

At that moment, veins bulged in Feng Wuya’s forehead. His eyes were bloodshot, and his feet danced in mid-air as he cried out with difficulty.

He was the grandson of the Grand Elder of the Feng Clan. Everyone had looked up to him since the day he was born. With his lofty position, he had never experienced this kind of terror!

“Release my grandson. Could it be that you want to start a war between the Feng family and the Jiang family?!” The virtual image spoke angrily when he saw Ye Qingtang lift up Feng Wuya.

Ye Qingtang swept a cold glance at the ashen Feng Wuya in her grip. She raised her eyes slightly, looked at the virtual image, and scoffed coldly. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“What a joke. Who does the Feng Clan think they are? Could it be that the Feng Clan does not know who the First Domain belongs to?!”

“How dare you!” The virtual image raged. “Does the Jiang family really think that the First Domain belongs to them?!”

“How dare you. After I, a Heavenly Venerate, arrived, your grandson dared to be discourteous to me. If it were anyone else, I would have already killed his entire family. Today, I am only killing your grandson. You should count yourself fortunate!”

With that, Ye Qingtang did not give the virtual image an opportunity to say anything else. A cold gleam of light suddenly flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes. Her hand exerted a force and instantly crushed Feng Wuya’s neck!

Feng Wuya’s neck immediately broke with a crack. His head drooped limply, and blood seeped from his eyes, ears, mouth, and nose. He was dead on the spot.
