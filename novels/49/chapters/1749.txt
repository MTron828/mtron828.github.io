Chapter 1750: Fiendish Demon (3)

If she was discovered, Ye Qingtang would suffer the same terrible fate as Qiu Ci.

Qiu Ci was much more powerful than Ye Qingtang. Although she was not that highly ranked in this year’s Martial Arts Championship, Ye Qingtang had seen Qiu Ci in battle. Among the top ten, Baili Xi was probably the only one who could defeat Qiu Ci.

But even the mighty Qiu Ci appeared as weak as an ant in front of those fiendish demons, and ended up a torture victim in their hands...

In fact, even a Paragon level practitioner would be useless against the strength and viciousness of these fiendish demons.

As she pondered this, Ye Qingtang felt that it was truly a miracle for her to have journeyed thus far into this mountain valley. This valley was completely different from the Frozen Ice Fields. It was like an entirely different world of its own. All those monsters that roamed the Frozen Ice Fields were nowhere to be seen here.

Over here...

It seemed like only the fiendish demons existed. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Ye Qingtang steadied herself. She slowly made her way to the waterfall and gazed down at the blood at her feet. She was feeling very terrible about Qiu Ci’s fate but was helpless against it.

All the creatures inside this mystic realm were powerful beyond belief. The so-called elite in their Central Mainland were as insignificant as a bunch of ants, just waiting to be squashed.

It had never been more difficult just to stay alive.

Just as Ye Qingtang was about to leave, she heard a noise from some undergrowth nearby. She instinctively turned to look.

She was completely thunderstruck by what she saw.

Behind that undergrowth was the corpse of a fiendish demon. The demon appeared to have died not long ago, as its blood had yet to curdle. Beside the corpse were tiny pieces of minced up meat.

It was human flesh...

There was a large quantity of it, spread across the ground.

Originally, Ye Qingtang had found it strange why she only saw Qiu Ci, but didn’t see any traces of Qiu Chen.

Now...

Ye Qingtang knew where Qiu Chen was.

Ye Qingtang frowned as she looked at the mound of minced meat.

Fiendish demons were addicted to torturing and killing humans. Qiu Chen had been their first target, while Qiu Ci was their second...

Ye Qingtang took a deep breath. Even though Qiu Chen had already been minced up, she knew his consciousness was still around. Every single bit of flesh was able to feel pain and transmit it to his soul.

After being skinned and his flesh sliced off, all that was left of Qiu Chen was a pile of white bones, discarded carelessly amongst some trees at the side. It would not be long before his flesh disintegrated into the soil, and his consciousness relegated to that remaining pile of bones. But most of those bones had already been trampled and crushed...

With a soft sigh, Ye Qingtang reached out and picked up all the pieces of bone that she could find. Even so, there were still nearly half of the pieces missing, including his skull.

By the end, her hands were stained with blood and she gazed down at them. Qiu Chen and Qiu Ci’s terrible fate was like a foreboding premonition to her own. She slowly turned toward the fiendish demon corpse lying by the side.

That fiendish demon must have been killed by the earlier two demons. But they were too engrossed in torturing their new playthings and didn’t get around to consuming the body yet...

An idea suddenly came to Ye Qingtang.
