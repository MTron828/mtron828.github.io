“Alright.” Yin Qingluo nodded slightly.

Yan Shu did not say anything and continued bringing Ye Qingtang around the valley.

Sheng Qianyu’s eyes were filled with gratitude as he watched Ye Qingtang’s fading back.

“Senior Sister Yin, this Senior Brother Ye…”

Yin Qingluo returned to her senses and looked at the thankful Sheng Qianyu. “Ye Chen was just apprenticed to Master and does not really understand the valley’s situation yet. For today’s incident… you’ve suffered.”

Sheng Qianyu shook his head. “I’m all to blame for not seeing people clearly and being too trustful of others. I know… Master is thinking in consideration of the general situation.”

Yin Qingluo sighed. Incidents like today’s happened in Falling Sky Valley occasionally, and they, Admirable Sky Peak disciples, have been swallowing the insult and suppressing their indignation. In terms of grievance, which of them was short of any?

Yet, even if they were aggrieved, they could only endure it.

“Master has his own difficulties. Currently, all the other Peak Masters’ have veiled criticisms over Master being the acting Valley Master. For the stability of Falling Sky Valley, we can only be like this.”

Sheng Qianyu nodded. Although he agreed in his heart, one should judge the matter as it stood. When he was picked on by those Blue Cloud Peak disciples, when was he not aggrieved? However, this could not be said out…

“Alright. I’ll bring you to check your injuries first.” Yin Qingluo did not say anything further and brought Sheng Qianyu to the physician.

Coincidentally, Yin Qingluo saw three familiar figures at the physician.

“Eldest Senior Brother, Senior Sister Ye, Senior Brother Qian.”

There were two males and a female in the room. Apart from the devil incarnate, Qian Ze, from before, there were two other people: the male was tall and had an extraordinary bearing while the lady beside had a graceful frame and an enchanting face.

“Little Qingqing, why are you here?” Ye Ningxi sat on a chair cross-legged as she supported her chin with a hand, and her rosy lips formed a bewitching smile.

Ye Ningxi was Perfected Xuanchen’s disciple and was born with enchanting beauty. Although her natural endowments were extremely high, she was temperamental. If she was not wearing the Falling Sky Valley uniform, it seemed that she was from an evil cult just by a look.

Yin Qingluo immediately recounted the events and let the physician check Sheng Qianyu’s injuries.

“The Blue Cloud Peak people are getting more and more outrageous. Only you few people have a good temper and can endure it.” Ye Ningxi spoke with a raised brow.

“If I have to say, just eliminate anyone who refuses to accept it. Can a dead person still come out to stir trouble?” Qian Ze yawned from aside and spoke casually.

Yin Qingluo had a little headache as she looked at these two people.

After Master gave the orders, most of the disciples obeyed him, including those who were perverse and unwilling to suffer those grievances. Ye Ningxi and Qian Ze were two of them. Although they were unwilling to follow his words, they did not defy it deliberately either, and they spent less time in the valley, fortunately. Out of sight, out of mind.

In addition, these two people had brilliant skills and an eccentric personality. No ordinary disciples from other peaks would seek death and offend them too much.

“Enough.” A cold voice rang. The tall youth who had remained silent frowned slightly.

Even eccentric people like Ye Ningxi and Qian Ze did not say anything more after that person spoke.

“Eldest Senior Brother.” Yin Qingluo looked up at that male with reverence.
