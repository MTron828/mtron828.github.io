Chapter 555 Replenish for Prosperity (4)

Since the Holy Lord had disappeared, the orders from the Holy Lady were a must to obey. As the Blood Moon Division Head, Jiang Chen had no authority to force the Holy Lady to leave with them. He had to go according to her plan. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Shuo Tianzang, you shall follow the Holy Lady in the future to ensure her safety.”

The Blood Moon Division Head Jiang Chen looked at Shuo Tianzang after a while.

“That’s not necessary.” Ye Qingtang shook her head.

Shuo Tianzang was indeed strong, but as the Blood Moon Sect Branch Master, he would be needed by the division.

Furthermore, she got too many things to settle. It would be inconvenient for him to follow her.

Shuo Tianzang appeared to be depressed when Ye Qingtang rejected the offer. It would a great honor for him to be able to follow the Blood Moon Holy Lady.

“I shall not insist since Holy Lady has already made her mind,” Jiang Chen said respectfully.

After a short while, The Blood Moon Division Head Jiang Chen waved his hand at Ye Qingtang and led everyone back.

The eight scarlet demonic beasts pulled the huge blood-colored carriage and disappeared gradually.

When the people of the Blood Moon Sect were leaving, there was another figure that was trying to sneak away.

“You! Where do you want to go.” Ye Qingtang smashed her palm down as the Blood Moon Elder was sneaking his way out.

Pow!

Ye Qingtang’s palm landed heavily on the Blood Moon Elder’s left shoulder.

The Blood Moon Elder shivered and turned over immediately. He forced out an awkward smile and said, “Holy… Holy Lady… Do you still have any orders to give…”

Ye Qingtang sized up the Blood Moon Elder in front of her. She appeared to be full of interest and said, “Weren’t you always thinking about when you could finally kill me with one move?”

How could she not know the plans that the Blood Moon Elder had all the time?

The Revolving Soul Orb that he gave her previously must be part of his plan to kill her. However, the Revolving Soul Orb fell into Elder Lin’s hand by chance, and he was the one that took the full blast of the explosion.

If not, she would be dead from the explosion of the Revolving Soul Orb.

The Blood Moon Elder’s body trembled, and he almost fell to the ground upon hearing her words.

The Blood Moon Elder pretended to comply the day when Ye Qingtang forced her to sign the contract, but he never stopped planning to kill her one day from that moment.

However, the Ye Qingtang back then was just a Xuanling Sect disciple.

Now, she was the Blood Moon Holy Lady. He would never dare to have the same thoughts in the past anymore.

“Ha… Haha… Ha… Holy Lady, I don’t understand what you mean… The respect I have for you is heavier than the stretch of mountains, deeper than the ocean, higher than the giants…”

Ye Qingtang waved her hand in disgust to stop him from nagging and spurting out saliva. The change in attitude was so fast, and so did his skill of saying nonsense improve. It seemed like he deserved more than the position as the Blood Moon Elder based on his abilities. He could even be a guardian.

“My infatuation towards Holy Lady can be proved by the Sun and the Moon, by the Heaven and the Earth…” Cold sweat started to appear on the Blood Moon Elder’s forehead.

“Infatuation?” Ye Qingtang frowned and showed an odd expression.

“No no no… my loyalty…” The Blood Moon Elder changed his wording immediately.

“Loyalty?” Ye Qingtang squinted her eyes.
