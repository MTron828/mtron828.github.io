Chapter 1981: Crimson League (5)

“After all, I was once part of the Crimson League. Now I’ve done my part in sending them a reminder so I have nothing else to do with it.” Ye Qingtang discreetly observed the little white balls that passed by them.

The little white balls headed in the direction of the Fox Demon’s cave after hearing Ye Qingtang’s words.

Meanwhile, the two tribe leaders hadn’t noticed a thing at all.

When Ye Qingtang saw the little white balls head for the cave, a small smile quirked in the corner of her mouth.

The snow spirit...

It was a resentful spirit that was unique to the demon clan. It was barely seen in the First Domain but widely known in the Second Domain.

Ye Qingtang had never seen the snow spirit in her previous lifetime, she only heard a little about it. All she knew was that such resentful spirits were manipulated by the shaman of the demon clan.

Ye Qingtang didn’t think too much about it, but when she saw the mark on the Fox Demon’s glabella, she realized that the Fox Demon was a shaman of the demon clan.

The Fox Demon had mentioned it previously, it was clear about everything that happened in the Central Mainland. It must have gotten the news by manipulating the snow spirits.

That meant the snow spirits were able to turn into different animals and hide around the mainland under the Priest’s manipulation.

When Ye Qingtang walked out of the cave earlier, she already noticed that the snow spirits were casually hanging around her surroundings. In fact, she had meant to let those snow spirits overhear her conversation with the two tribe leaders. The snow spirits must have already reported back to the Fox Demon.

Now that Ye Qingtang had already achieved her goals, she no longer needed to remain in the Frost Abyss. She took the tribe leaders with her and left, making sure that she was merely reminding them.

Unsurprisingly, right after Ye Qingtang left the Frost Abyss, the Frost Abyss got the news from the snow spirits.

The Fox Demon’s eyes narrowed. It didn’t believe Ye Qingtang earlier on but now, it went into deep thought.

After a moment of silence, the Fox Demon walked in front of a huge ice mirror. Lifting its hand, beams of light shot out from the ice mirror. Suddenly, a figure appeared behind the ice mirror.

The Fox Demon bowed respectfully when it saw the figure.

“Greetings, Priest.”

“What’s the matter?” A deep voice came from inside the ice mirror.

The Fox Demon briefly explained the purpose behind the Holy Lord of Shadows’ visit and everything about the Ancient You Clan.

The figure in the ice mirror paused for a moment before speaking.

“What is your understanding of the Ancient You Clan?” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Even though the Crimson League had a few ambassadors around the different mainlands in the First Domain, they didn’t really bother with the First Domain because of the backward martial culture.

“The sudden increase in powers of the Ancient You Clan is indeed abnormal. The Holy Lord of Shadows also mentioned the Spirit of Chaos fragment, the Ancient You Clan seems to be collecting it,” the Fox Demon reported.

The figure in the ice mirror took a moment before replying, “I’ll send someone over to the Central Mainland to investigate.”

“Noted.”

If the Holy Lord of Shadows was speaking the truth, they had to do something to get rid of the Ancient You Clan’s influence. However, if the Holy Lord of Shadows was trying to make use of the Crimson League to get rid of an enemy, the Temple of Shadows would become one of the Crimson League’s main targets.
