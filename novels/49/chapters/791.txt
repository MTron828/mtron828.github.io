Chapter 792 Old Acquaintance (2)

Long Jiang’s high cultivation was personally taught by that lady in order to leave someone who could be a powerful protector by the Grand Imperial Sire’s side. 1

Qu Xiangyang did not say anything to Long Jiang. He walked straight to the royal sedan and kowtowed to the little emperor.

“Your Majesty, the incident today started because of me. Please do not blame him,” Qu Xiangyang said while kneeling to the little Emperor.

The little Emperor cast a glance at Qu Xiangyang and said, “Who are you? Who allowed you to talk to me? Men, bring him away. Long Jiang, what are you waiting for? Hurry up and kill that lowly peasant for

me.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Qu Xiangyang was shaken. Before he could say anything, he was brought away by a few guards.

“Your Majesty, I…” Qu Xiangyang still wanted to speak.

The little Emperor frowned impatiently. “Shut him up. How noisy.”

Qin Long grinned at the little Emperor’s idiocy, and a pleased expression filled his eyes. He arched a brow when he saw that Qu Xiangyang was gagged.

Long Jiang was originally a little hesitant, but the little Emperor had given his orders. Then, he directly charged towards Ye Qingtang resolutely.

The skills of a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord were not what ordinary people could compare to.

Long Jiang’s speed and strength were extremely frightening

Ye Qingtang’s expression remained normal as she watched Long Jiang charging towards her. She had long known that the little Emperor did not know what was right or wrong due to Qin Long’s deceit and also knew that Long Jiang only listened to the Emperor’s orders. She immediately lifted her hand and attacked head front!

The battle between two half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lords was terrifying.

In just the blink of an eye, the surrounding buildings were crushed in the aftermath from the battle.

The little Emperor’s gaze did not remain on the battlefield as he looked straight behind, where his eyes sparkled the moment he saw a fierce silver wolf and a tender little white tiger.

“Men, catch that silver wolf and little cat.”

The silver wolf narrowed its eyes.

The little white tiger glared at that unbridled child.

“What the f*ck. How dare he say that I’m a cat?!”

The guards were about to close in on them but were suddenly killed by a golden flame. Long Jiang was slightly stupefied. He never thought that not only was this pretty young man not in the disadvantageous position in their battle, but he even had spare time to attack others.

“Long Jiang, why haven’t you killed him yet!” The little Emperor shouted unhappily when he saw that his sport was spoiled.

Long Jiang’s eyes flickered; he was not as relaxed as before.

He and this young man were both half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord, and their skills were nearly the same. However, the golden flames around this young man was a thorny problem, and he could not take the young man down.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes sharpened as she looked at Long Jiang’s serious expression. Adjusting her Paragon Skill, a golden flame crashed at Long Jiang all of a sudden.

Long Jiang’s eyes dilated upon seeing a strong flame surging towards him, and an inauspicious feeling took over.

There’s something wrong with this golden flame!

Long Jiang hurriedly shifted his inner qi.

The moment the golden flame crashed, a loud boom shattered everyone’s eardrums.

Long Jiang was forced back several meters by that force, and most of his clothes were burnt. There was even a searing pain that remained on his skin.

They were both half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lords.

Never had he thought that this young man’s skills would actually be above his!
