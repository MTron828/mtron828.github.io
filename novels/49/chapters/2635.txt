Chapter 2636 Shocking Change (2)

At that moment, Han Cangming’s expression finally started to turn serious. He could not help sizing up Ye Qingtang again.

Han Cangming used his heaven-defying supernatural powers to remove the Karma Bloodline spreading on his body. However, he realized that it was useless. This Karma Bloodline was like a sticky plaster cast. It had no intention of leaving at all. Instead, it became even tighter.

A cold glint flashed across Han Cangming’s eyes and his killing intent surged.

In the next second, a strong wind blew around them and their clothes fluttered.

“The Karma Bloodline is indeed miraculous. But will it still be effective if the owner dies?” Han Cangming stared at Ye Qingtang and asked indifferently.

Ye Qingtang, “…”

She would never be able to clear her name with Han Cangming. The Karma Bloodline was really not hers…

“Swoosh!”

Han Cangming moved and was instantly beside Ye Qingtang. His suppressive aura made Ye Qingtang unable to move at all. The feeling of being restrained by an invisible force appeared again.

All Ye Qingtang could do was stand rooted to the ground and watch Han Cangming deliver a fatal blow to her.

However, Han Cangming’s actions were rather strange. He was clearly attacking her but he kept missing

“Boom!”

A terrifying explosion spread throughout the entire place. Han Cangming’s palm strike landed a distance away and shattered a mountain peak. At this moment, Han Cangming suddenly stopped and hugged his head with both hands. An indescribably painful expression appeared on his face and a terrifying red glint surfaced in his indifferent eyes.

“Get out!”

Han Cangming nearly lost control as he roared.

The power of the Karma Bloodline was trying to possess him!

A dignified supreme Immortal Emperor was being possessed by someone else. If this news were to spread, it would probably make everyone laugh their heads off!

Instantly, countless chaotic memories surged into Han Cangming’s mind.

“I see… I see!”

With a crazed expression, Han Cangming looked at Ye Qingtang, who was at a loss.

“She… is mine!”

Han Cangming shouted angrily.

“You… have no way to protect her. You’re already dead! She… can only belong to me!” “You don’t belong to this… era. Get lost…!”

“From the past to the future… you are me… I am you…”

Looking at the crazy Han Cangming, Ye Qingtang was baffled. She had no idea what was happening to Han Cangming. “Ha… haha… I…am trying to possess myself?!”

“In that case, I’ll destroy her so that she won’t have to suffer in the human world…!”

As he spoke, endless terrifying divine energy erupted from Han Cangming’s body. Ye Qingtang was instantly restrained by some unknown force and she moved towards Han Cangming involuntarily. “Miss Ye… don’t be afraid.”

“Woman, you’re mine!”

Two completely different voices rang out from Han Cangming’s mouth simultaneously. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

At this moment, Han Cangming’s left eye turned blood-red, its gaze extremely gentle. Meanwhile, his other eye revealed a terrifying coldness.

Ye Qingtang stared at Han Cangming in surprise. There seemed to be two completely different independent personalities in Han Cangming’s body…

The blood-colored eye on Han Cangming’s left appeared very familiar to Ye Qingtang.

“Ling Yan?!”
