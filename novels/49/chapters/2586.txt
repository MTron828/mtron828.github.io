Ye Qingtang frowned slightly. In this current situation, she really did not know whether to laugh or cry.

Within moments, the power of the Divine Phoenix Bloodline had been completely devoured by the extremely domineering Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline. Not a single drop remained.

Actually, Ye Qingtang knew all along.

The mutated Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline could devour everything, It could even devour heaven and earth. The reason why the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline had not stirred in her body for so long and why it did not attack the Divine Phoenix Bloodline was entirely because the former’s

power was still weak and it did not dare to provoke the latter.

But for some reason, just a few days after arriving in this strange era, not only had Ye Qingtang broken through from the Fifth Heaven level Divine Lord to the mid-stage Ninth level extremely quickly, she was also very close to the sub-Emperor stage. Even her Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline had

become much more powerful than before.

In Ye Qingtang’s era, her Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline was still weak like an infant. However, the situation was different now. This infant had suddenly grown into a burly man and was no longer afraid. He finally made a move on the Divine Phoenix Bloodline.

Not only that, after completely devouring the Divine Phoenix Bloodline, Ye Qingtang could clearly feel that her Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline had grown by too much.

Ye Qingtang looked at the cup on the table and reached out her hand.

In the next second, the water glass shattered and the water in it tumed into natural energy that was absorbed into Ye Qingtang’s body.

The scene made Ye Qingtang speechless.

Fortunately, she could still control the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline. Otherwise, wouldn’t the bloodline devour her too?!

‘What an extremely domineering bloodline power!

Unfortunately, although her Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline was extremely domineering, it could not differentiate between friend and foe. When it completely swallowed the Divine Phoenix Bloodline, Ye Qingtang vaguely felt that she had let the Divine Phoenix down.

No matter what.

Before Ye Qingtang had time to feel guilty, a red flame instantly surged out of her palm.

“What?”

Ye Qingtang was startled.

This kind of flame was exclusive to the Divine Phoenix Bloodline, and her Divine Phoenix Bloodline had already been devoured by the Heavenly Demon Bloodline. Why was she still able to use the power of the Divine Phoenix Bloodline?

Everything that was happening had completely exceeded Ye Qingtang’s understanding.

“am I ina blessed paradise?” Ye Qingtang muttered in surprise.

However, Ye Qingtang quickly rejected that notion. This place was completely different from the wonderland that the big yellow dog mentioned. But if it was not a wonderland, how to explain everything that had happened? ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

In just two days, she had advanced from the Fifth Heaven level Divine Lord to a cultivation level that was close to that of a sub-Emperor. Even her Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline had undergone a significant leap. Furthermore, she could still use the power of the Divine Phoenix Bloodline, which

had been devoured by the Heavenly Demon Bloodline!

It was all too unbelievable.

Before Ye Qingtang could think further, the originally red flame in her palm turned pitch-black. It was like an eternal fire from the deepest depths of hell.

“This... Could this be...”

Ye Qingtang stared at the black flame in her palm thoughtfully.

This power was countless times stronger than the Divine Phoenix Bloodline.
