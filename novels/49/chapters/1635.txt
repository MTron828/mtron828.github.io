Chapter 1636: I Won’t Pay (2)

“It’s not too late to turn back. All you have to do is hand over your allowance, and you won’t suffer physically.” Jiang Yiran smiled as he looked at those who were trying to dissuade Ye Qingtang.

“That’s not necessary.” Ye Qingtang shook her head.

Jiang Yisheng and the others wished they could drag Ye Qingtang back. The little monster was absent, and Jiang Yisheng, the most powerful among them, had been defeated. How could a rookie like Ye Qingtang possibly be a match for Jiang Yiran?

“It’s up to you. I won’t bully you. You can decide how we should compete,” Jiang Yiran said graciously.

Ye Qingtang thought for a moment and said, “Just now you compared palm techniques. Now, let’s compare finger techniques.”

Jiang Yiran burst out laughing at Ye Qingtang’s words. If his companions had not left with Jiang Yanyun, the surrounding area would be ringing with laughter.

“You want to compare finger techniques with me? Are you sure?” The corners of Jiang Yiran’s eyes crinkled with amusement as if he had just heard a really funny joke.

Jiang Yisheng and his companions went berserk.

“Ye Qingtang, Jiang Yiran’s finger technique is one of the best in Taiyuan Valley. Are you crazy?”

“Don’t be a fool. Just hand your allowance over and come away with us.”

No matter what, others thought that Ye Qingtang was part of their clique. If Jiang Yiran managed to humiliate them again, their reputation would be trampled in the mud.

“I’m sure.” Ye Qingtang nodded. Before Jiang Yu left, he had mostly taught her the finger technique, and that was what she had practiced the most in the two-star constellation world.

“Alright, since you insist, I won’t say anything else lest others say that I bullied you. I’ll let you go first. If I move by even an inch, then I’d have lost,” Jiang Yiran said patronizingly.

“Okay.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

Jiang Yisheng and the others were frantic, but they could not dissuade the stubborn Ye Qingtang.

Where did Shaobai find this crazy girl?

It’s bad enough that she insisted on walking this fatal road, but she won’t listen to our advice at all!

Jiang Yiran lazily stood there and tilted his chin, signaling Ye Qingtang to begin.

Ye Qingtang slowly stepped forward. She reviewed the scene where Jiang Yu had first demonstrated the finger technique to her. After a moment, she looked up and slowly raised her hand. Her pale, delicate finger slowly pointed outwards and moved unhurriedly towards Jiang Yiran’s glabella.

Jiang Yiran looked nonchalant as if he was not bothered by Ye Qingtang’s move at all. He was inwardly pondering how much allowance he could extort from Jiang Yisheng and the others.

Just as Jiang Yiran was building castles in the clouds, he suddenly sensed a piercing pain in his glabella.

He immediately snapped to attention and saw that Ye Qingtang’s fingertip was slowly approaching his glabella. Although she moved slowly, it shocked Jiang Yiran.

What is going on?

There was nothing special about Ye Qingtang’s fingertip, but as she slowly pushed it towards him, the finger seemed to create a sense of pressure that caused the air to condense. The formless sense of pressure was as sharp as a knife.

Jiang Yiran realized that the pain in his glabella was becoming increasingly apparent. It was as if something was piercing his skull. In an instant, his face turned completely pale, and a drop of cold sweat seeped from his forehead.

It will kill me...

This shocking thought suddenly entered Jiang Yiran’s mind. When the Jiang Family finger technique was fully exercised, the power of a single finger could kill someone without even touching them.

The instant Ye Qingtang’s fingertip was about to touch Jiang Yiran’s glabella, his face drained of blood, and he instinctively stepped back.
