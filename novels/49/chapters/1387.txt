1388 Difficult to Refuse Such Kindness 2

Anyway, the Dragon Court Sect was never fond of the Yuan Kingdom, and it was better now that the Yuan Kingdom exposed the Dragon Court Sect. Others may even think that the Yuan Kingdom was discerning and that it steered away from the Dragon Court Sect because it knew about the Dragon Court Sect’s scheme all along.

The Yuan Emperor, who once yearned to be part of the Dragon Court Sect, was extremely fortunate.

What bullsh*t Dragon Court Sect! It could not even match up to their Immortal Su’s finger.

Ye Qingtang tugged her lips as she looked at the Yuan Emperor, who lied blatantly.

In terms of changing attitude instantly, this person was truly outstanding.

The Emperors in the palace who were still worried about how to recover their reputation were delighted when they heard the Yuan Emperor.

Right! Why did they not think of that?

The Dragon Court Sect was fake, but this Immortal Su was a true immortal!

Almost immediately, those Emperors exchanged a look and dashed toward Ye Qingtang, who was riding on the huge white tiger, before kneeling down in uniformity.

“Immortal Su! We were deceived by the Dragon Court Sect and almost fell for their trap. Fortunately, you stepped in and exposed their true faces. We are extremely grateful to you.” Emperor Qi’s mouth seemed to be layered with honey as he praised Ye Qingtang vigorously.

“It’s fine,” Ye Qingtang said plainly with an aloof demeanor.

“Have you all returned to your senses? Didn’t you say that Immortal Su was a quack just now?” The Yuan Kingdom’s Emperor grabbed the opportunity and showed Emperor Qi down actively.

Emperor Qi did not dare to refute and smiled. “Yes, yes, yes. I was blind to not recognize your immortal demeanor. The Dragon Court Sect is all to be blamed for being so cunning and fooling the world… We have realized our errors but…”

Emperor Qi intentionally put on a troubled expression and said, “The mainland’s citizens already have a deep faith in the Dragon Court Sect. If we destroyed their faith now, the world would break out into chaos.”

Then, Emperor Qi kowtowed to Ye Qingtang and cried loudly. “Immortal Su, please be benevolent and spread the immortal’s blessings to the world in place of the Dragon Court Sect.”

“Please be benevolent, Immortal Su!” The Emperors echoed loudly.

The Yuan Kingdom’s Emperor was delighted as he watched everyone requesting Immortal Su.

If Immortal Su replaced the Dragon Court Sect and became the only immortal on this mainland, the Yuan Kingdom would definitely become the country closest to immortality!

However, Ye Qingtang merely looked at everyone in a detached manner and said coldly, “You all want me to succeed these people who offended the majesty of an immortal?” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Everyone was alarmed by what Ye Qingtang said and broke out in a cold sweat immediately.

They said the wrong thing!

The Dragon Court Sect was a gathering of quacks. How could a dignified immortal clear up the mess of a group of quacks…

“No, no, no! It was a slip of the tongue. I did not mean that. How can you take over the filthy place of the Dragon Court Sect? What I mean is…” Emperor Qi hurriedly changed his stance and spoke.

“Is… is that your immortal skills are powerful. It is our honor to have you on the mainland, and we must naturally worship you. Please do not abandon the world and give us an opportunity…”

Emperor Qi spoke quickly, and the other Emperors repeated his words.

It was simply humiliating for her to succeed the Dragon Court Sect. However, if the immortal was willing to rebuild a sect, it was naturally the best.

By then, they could find an excuse and say that the Dragon Court Sect’s immortal had passed away and that there was no immortal presiding over the Dragon Court Sect. Instead, the immortal world sent another more powerful immortal to lead them.

This explanation was perfect!

It would not embarrass the Emperors and powerful figures and would also satisfy the immortal.
