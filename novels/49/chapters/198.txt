Chapter 199: Sect Mission (1)

Qin Huan ran so quickly as though someone was after his life.

Ye Qingtang could not help but find that scene funny. She thought that Qin Huan was worried that she would settle scores with him and did not notice that the murderous expression in the silver wolf’s eyes faded after Qin Huan’s departure.

“Heh heh, little baby. I got many good things today.” Ye Qingtang went up to the silver wolf and grinned at it as when she saw that the room was empty.

The silver wolf quietly looked at Ye Qingtang’s “salivating” expression with a very… complicated expression.

“I have not given you a massage today. Now is just nice.” Ye Qingtang did not care whether her silver wolf could understand or not as she rolled up her sleeves and aimed at its furry body with her fingers.

Once the silver wolf heard the word “massage,” its body froze, and before it could react, a pair of dishonest hands stroke its body familiarly.

As though she felt the wolf’s frozen body, Ye Qingtang comforted it gently. “Don’t worry, baby. I will be very gentle.”

“…” The silver wolf looked at the besotted Ye Qingtang speechlessly and laid down with a resigned expression, letting her trample it as she wished.

Ye Qingtang was caressing the wolf delightedly but did not know that Su Wan, who went out previously, went to look for Yun Shu. She exaggeratedly told that Ye Qingtang and Qin Huan “entered and left the room together” and that Ye Qingtang was too busy getting close with other senior brothers and probably had no time to meet Yun Shu.

Yun Shu did not say anything though. Because Ye Qingtang had the silver wolf, she hurriedly returned to massage the wolf after cultivation every day and did not have many interactions with Yun Shu.

Days passed.

In the blink of an eye, it had been a month since the new disciples entered the sect.

In this one month, all the new disciples familiarized themselves with everything in Xuanling Sect’s outer sect and were on the right track in their cultivation.

And once this first month was over, the new disciples were to welcome a new challenge.

Sect-appointed missions.

This was a mission that every sect disciple had to complete, and the contents of the mission were appointed by the outer sect warden.

This day, all the new disciples were summoned. The teaching warden stood in front of them with many files in his hand.

“Today, the sect will appoint a mission to every one of you. Regardless of a solo or a team mission with other disciples, all of you must place the sect’s glory as the main priority when you are out handling matters. If you do anything which damages the sect’s reputation, you will be punished according to the sect rules,” said the teaching warden coldly.

Everyone nodded.

Then, the warden handed down the missions.

While these disciples were to begin on sect missions, they did not have enough experience after all. Apart from Ye Qingtang, who completed a rewarded mission half a month ago, most had not come into contact with such missions. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Thus, most of the missions were still relatively easy.

Yun Shu only exchanged a few words with Ye Qingtang in the past few weeks and finally met her then.

“How are you recently, Junior Sister Ye?” Yun Shu asked with a smile.

Ye Qingtang had a handsome wolf to accompany her these few days, and her days were spent comfortably at ease. The fatigue from a whole day of cultivation would instantly vanish every time she stroked the wolf in the name of massaging it.

“Everything is good. I wonder what Senior Brother Yun thinks of this appointed mission?” Ye Qingtang asked smilingly. Although she was not overly close to Yun Shu these days, she was always paying attention to any news regarding Yun Shu. She did not forget her plan to investigate the truth behind Yun Shu’s fall in the past life.
