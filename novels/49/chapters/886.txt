Chapter 887 How To Thank

Seeing that Ye You fled away, Ye Qingtang wanted to chase after her, but Ling Yan grabbed Ye Qingtang’s hand firmly and did not give her the chance to go after Ye You.

“Ling Yan!”

Ye Qingtang’s brows were tightly furrowed immediately. “Have you held enough!”

“If you don’t mind, I can hold on a little longer.” Ling Yan chuckled.

“You!” Ye Qingtang was speechless for a moment. This Ling Yan’s brain… has issues, doesn’t it?What the hell is he saying?!

Seeing that Ye Qingtang was about to flare up, Ling Yan released his grip sensibly. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

In the next second, Ye Qingtang rushed out of the cave, but Ye You had already vanished without a trace.

In no time, Ye Qingtang returned to the cave again and looked at Ling Yan. “She and I… have a blood feud.”

Ling Yan smiled in response. “Miss Ye, I am not clear about that. How about you tell me about it?”

“Do you wish to hear?” Ye Qingtang fixed her eyes on Ling Yan.

Ling Yan replied. “I am extremely interested in everything about you. If you don’t mind, you can tell me about all major and trivial matters.”

Why is this person…

However, Ye Qingtang recounted her grudge with Ye You to Ling Yan thoroughly.

After hearing about the relationship and enmity between the two, Ling Yan laughed and told Ye Qingtang. “Miss Ye… In this case, you need to be responsible for me. Both of you share the same surname Ye, and I was almost killed by her.”

For a moment, Ye Qingtang did not have any words to reply. When did Ling Yan’s skin become so thick?

“Since she almost killed you, you can find her and ask her to be responsible. It so happens that you let her go too,” Ye Qingtang said.

However, Ling Yan shook his head. “How can she be compared to you, Miss Ye?”

Not waiting for Ye Qingtang to reply, Ling Yan laughed and said, “Forget it. Even if you have a huge grudge against her, it is not a wise action to attack her now.”

“Oh?” Ye Qingtang examined Ling Yan. “Why?”

“This person is the granddaughter of the Jiang clan’s Grand Elder, Jiang Duantian. Jiang Duantian is the current Domain Monarch and has many means. From my observation, if a murderous intent arose within you just now and you attacked her, you would definitely be counter-damaged by the Dharma treasure. Not only would she not die, but you would also be in an extremely dangerous situation instead.” Ling Yan explained.

“Are you saying that Ye You has a life-protecting Dharma treasure on her…?” Ye Qingtang clarified.

“That’s exactly what I’m saying.” Ling Yan nodded and added on. “The Dharma treasure on Ye You could even withstand a fatal blow from a Divine Arcane Supremacy, and the counter-damage ability of the Dharma treasure could easily crush an ordinary Arcane Supremacy. If I did not stop you, I’m afraid

you…”

Ye Qingtang frowned deeply after hearing Ling Yan.

This was her miscalculation.

She clearly knew that Ye You was already found by the Jiang clan. Now that she was sent to the dangerous Dragon Vein, how would there not be any life-protecting means…

However, Ye Qingtang saw that Ling Yan schemed against Ye You previously. It seemed that with Ling Yan here, she actually lowered her guard a little.

“Thank you…”

A long while later, Ye Qingtang looked at Ling Yan and thanked him.

“There is still another way of thanking me. I have never liked verbal thank you’s.” Ling Yan looked at Ye Qingtang with a meaningful smile.

Ye Qingtang’s expression changed immediately. What cunning plot was Ling Yan thinking of exactly?

Seeing that Ye Qingtang had a grim expression, Ling Yan spoke again. “Forget it. If it’s Miss Ye, a verbal thank you is acceptable as

well.”
