Chapter 1828: Unexpected Surprise (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Thinking about how the weak and soft Jiang Shaobai who was with her all the time was an actual man, Ye Qingtang wanted to kill him.

Taking in a deep breath, Ye Qingtang forcefully suppressed the murderous intent in her heart. Jiang Shaobai this little brat. How long had he deceived her?

As for Mu Feiruo...

Ye Qingtang had always thought that Mu Feiruo was extremely tall, almost as tall as Baili Xi and the others, but had always thought that she was just a taller girl.

Unexpectedly...

He was also a cross-dresser.

Was the world full of cross dressers?!

At the thought of Jiang Yisheng worshiping Mu Feiruo like he was a goddess and constantly proclaiming his love for her, Ye Qingtang wanted to laugh. If Jiang Yisheng knew that his goddess was a man, could he still love her?

Jiang Shaobai and the other two seemed to be in a stupor and didn’t wake up even after Ye Qingtang called them a few times.

Ye Qingtang was very curious about how the three of them had turned into the mutant Fire Demons.

However, she breathed a sigh of relief when she saw that they were still alive. Other than the fact that they were in a stupor, they didn’t seem to have any other injuries on them. Their breathing was even and their lives didn’t seem to be in any danger.

It was a miracle that she had been able to find her partners in this strange mystic realm.

As for their gender...

She had no energy to think about that now.

Ye Qingtang took out some clothes from her space ring and threw them on the three people on the ground. She couldn’t very well leave them here and could only get Little White Tiger to grow bigger and carry them along as they continued on their journey forward.

Ye Qingtang also picked up Little Heavenly Demon, which had been thrown out by Little White Tiger along the way. Having been discarded so pitifully, Little Heavenly Demon’s face was full of grievance as it nestled in Ye Qingtang’s arms and whimpered.

What did it do to deserve being thrown out like discarded rubbish? Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Ye Qingtang looked at Little Heavenly Demon comfortingly before turning to look at the three unconscious men.

Gosh, she was exhausted.

Even though she wasn’t on particularly good terms with Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo, they had come into this mystic realm together and given her personality, Ye Qingtang couldn’t just leave them there to die.

This mystic realm was filled with unknown dangers. Ye Qingtang had seen Sang Feiyu die along with the others and Qingtang reduced to a monster’s plaything, and there was still Qiu Ci whom she had no idea was dead or alive.

Although Ye Qingtang didn’t know Qiu Ci’s whereabouts, she couldn’t just leave Baili Xi and the other two now that she had seen them.

The three of them were already the strongest among the ten, which was the only reason they had survived this long. If not for that, they would already have died or become the playthings of the monsters here. The more she thought about it, the more her brain started to hurt. A sigh came out of her lips.

To think that out of the original ten who had entered the mystic dimension, only four of them were left.

“These Fire Demons are different from the ones I remember. Three people were at its base. I was thinking that they wouldn’t have been so easy to deal with if they had been real Fire Demons.” Little White Tiger shook itself and stabilised the three people on its back.

The Fire Demons were servants of the Heavenly Demons and were not as strong as them, but even then they were at least at the Emperor level. There was no way Ye Qingtang could have devoured them so easily.

Little White Tiger had a feeling that these Fire Demons were just empty shells. If it had been a real Fire Demon controlled by the Heavenly Demons, there was no way they would have been a match for it, even if it had been a mutant type.

“You sound pretty regretful.” Ye Qingtang raised her eyebrows slightly.

“No, no, you must have heard wrongly,” Little White Tiger said as it quickly shook its head.
