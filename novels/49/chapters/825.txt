Chapter 826 Cross-Dress (2)

Ye Qingtang looked at Xuanyuan Yi coldly and replied. “A battle can happen anytime during training. Do I still have to unclothe myself completely? Moreover, what has it got to do with you whether I wash my body with clothes on or not?”

Xuanyuan Yi did not say anything else after hearing Ye Qingtang.

Many female disciples in Falling Sky Valley trained outside, and they would never remove all their clothes to wash their bodies even if they were covered in dust.

“Young one, you’re too arrogant.” Xuanyuan Yi stared at Ye Qingtang and said.

“Young one? Who are you?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“I am Falling Sky Valley’s Full Moon Peak Master.” Xuanyuan Yi shouted coldly.

“You’re one of the Peak Masters in Falling Sky Valley?!” Upon hearing that, Ye Qingtang’s face was filled with “astonishment”.

As he saw Ye Qingtang’s reaction, Xuanyuan Yi’s expression turned slightly better.

“So it’s senior Xuanyuan… Sorry for not recognizing you,” Ye Qingtang said with cupped fists.

“Let me ask you. Did you see a handsome young man wearing the Falling Sky Valley disciple’s uniform?” Xuanyuan Yi asked Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang was in deep thought after hearing the question. A while later, she suddenly said, “I saw a man burying himself in soil, and he was covered in soil all over, so I don’t know whether he is handsome or what he is wearing.” Ye Qingtang replied.

“Oh?!”

A glint flashed across Xuanyuan Yi’s eyes after hearing what Ye Qingtang said.

A man hiding in the soil-apart from Ye Chen, there was no way it could be anyone else.

“Where is that man now?!” Xuanyuan Yi shouted coldly.

Ye Qingtang immediately pointed a direction for Xuanyuan Yi and replied. “Senior Xuanyuan, I met him a few hours ago, and I am unable to judge whether that man is still hidden in the soil.”

After Ye Qingtang finished her sentence, Xuanyuan Yi immediately turned into a bolt of light and disappeared from sight.

After confirming that Xuanyuan Yi had left completely, the corners of Ye Qingtang’s lips curled up slightly, and a devilish smile hung on her alluring face.

“Xuanyuan Yi, you’re still too young.”

Then, Ye Qingtang turned around and walked out of the canyon.

The direction that Ye Qingtang pointed at just now was a lair, belonging to a large group of demonic beasts, which she saw when she was flying in the sky during the day. Although it was impossible for them to injure Xuanyuan Yi, they would not give Xuanyuan Yi a pleasant time.

In just a moment, roars of demonic beasts, along with Xuanyuan Yi’s enraged yells, echoed in the silent canyon.

On the journey, Ye Qingtang turned around and looked at the deeper areas of the canyon. “Xuanyuan Yi, you will not be able to find Ye Chen. You can just play with those large demonic beasts.”

Afterward, Ye Qingtang left the canyon completely without turning back. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

After returning to the central monarch city of Nine Nights Dynasty, it was already dawn of the second day.

The places which the little white tiger wrecked in Bliss Forging Workshop were already repaired. Today, the main entrance to Bliss Forging Workshop was shut tightly.

Noticing the situation, many visitors could only leave disappointedly.

Very quickly, Ye Qingtang went forward and knocked on the door.

The door was opened in a while, and Du Sheng poked his head out of the door.

“You are?”

Du Sheng asked with a frown when he saw a foreign lady outside the door.

“I’m looking for Master Du,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Is Master Du someone you can meet just because you wish to?” Unhappy, Du Sheng slammed the door shut heavily once again.
