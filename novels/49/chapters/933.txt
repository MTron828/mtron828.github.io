Chapter 934 The Heart of the Heavenly Dao 1

In both lifetimes, Ye Qingtang never thought that she would have any connection to a Fiendcelestial Beast.

However, after her rebirth, she first became linked to the little white tiger and then obtained the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix to become the only descendant of the Divine Phoenix.

It seemed that she had an unknown fate with Fiendcelestial Beasts in this life.

In the Divine Phoenix’s warm envelopment, about half a month had slipped by unconsciously.

During this period of time, the blood in Ye Qingtang’s body seemed to be cleansed over and over again. Currently, her blood had turned into scorching flames of which the divine might was unstoppable.

“The original Divine Phoenix bloodline…” At this moment, Ye Qingtang’s eyes were burning.

Bloodlines were divided into ranks as well. For the Phoenix bloodline, there had been too many renewals of bloodline since the primordial era, but the purest form was the original bloodline.

Ye Qingtang’s bloodline was personally imparted by the Divine Phoenix and was the purest form. In the case of the girl in green from before, although she also had the Phoenix bloodline, it was not as pure as Ye Qingtang’s original Phoenix bloodline. The difference and hierarchy between both bloodlines was like that of a monarch and a subject.

“Qingtang, how is your current cultivation base after absorbing a large amount of the power of the bloodline?” The Divine Phoenix asked some time later.

Ye Qingtang hurriedly replied. “Lord Divine Phoenix, I have already advanced from Yin Yang Third Heaven to Fifth Heaven.”

“Fifth Heaven…” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Hearing that Ye Qingtang only entered the Fifth Heaven, the Divine Phoenix was taken aback.

According to logic, even if the person was an extremely ordinary person without any martial skills, their martial cultivation would at least enter the Arcane Supremacy realm after obtaining its inheritance.

Ye Qingtang was already at the Yin Yang Perfected Lord Third Heaven realm before this, yet she only advanced two small realms after inheriting large amounts of the power of its bloodline?

“Lord Divine Phoenix… Did something happen?” Ye Qingtang’s heart skipped a beat when she heard the odd tone in the Divine Phoenix’s voice.

“Mhm. Don’t panic first. I’ll take a look after you have completely combined and absorbed the bloodline inheritance,” said the Divine Phoenix.

Since the Divine Phoenix said that, Ye Qingtang did not say anything and could only continue to wait.

The burning sensation which enveloped Ye Qingtang was like the rays of a mini-sun that dimmed over time. Another half a month later, all of the flames were completely absorbed by Ye Qingtang.

“What is your cultivation realm now?”

The Divine Phoenix opened its eyes and looked at Ye Qingtang, who had finished absorbing all of the powers of its bloodline.

“Lord Divine Phoenix, I am currently in the Yang Lord realm… and at the peak of the Seventh Heaven.” Ye Qingtang answered.

“Peak of Yin Yang Perfected Lord Seventh Heaven… You haven’t reached the Eighth Heaven… What exactly is going on…” The Divine Phoenix’s tone was extremely strange.

The Divine Phoenix was immensely confident in its bloodline inheritance. According to logic, after absorbing its bloodline inheritance completely, Ye Qingtang should at least be able to advance to the Divine Arcane Supremacy realm and even be at the Heavenly Venerate realm.

Even those ordinary humans without any martial cultivation should be able to enter the Divine Arcane Supremacy realm after obtaining its inheritance. Yet Ye Qingtang, who possessed a high martial gift and the blessing of the Ultimate Origin Skill, Rise of the Phoenix, only advanced four small realms. How could this be possible?!

“That’s not right. What exactly went wrong?” The Divine Phoenix mumbled as it pondered deeply.

A while later, the Divine Phoenix finally looked at Ye Qingtang and said, “I need to look at your body again.”
