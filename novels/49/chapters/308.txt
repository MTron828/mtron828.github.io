She, who usually rubbed the silver wolf’s far and teased the little lightning dragon, was completely focused on cultivation. The little lightning dragon which was heavily injured from the Spirit Condensation Mountain Village incident was shoved to the silver wolf to take care of it.

The silver wolf looked coldly at the little lightning dragon, which was forcefully shoved to his paw.

However, the little lightning dragon was trembling in fear, and before the silver wolf even took a glimpse at it, it immediately fainted by the silver wolf’s paw.

That morning, Ye Qingtang washed up and prepared to head to the Martial Arts Hall to cultivate. When she reached the entrance of the Martial Arts Hall, she suddenly saw a pale Yun Shu.

“Senior Brother Yun? Your injuries have not fully recovered. Why are you out already?” Ye Qingtang was a little surprised.

Yun Shu smiled faintly. “Thank you for worrying about me. My injuries are not serious anymore. It is all thanks to you for helping me to obtain the Shangyue Fire Tripod back. I used it to cultivate for many days, and my spirit root recovered. I am out for a stretch today.”

The injuries Yun Shu sustained previously almost caused him to drop the idea of cultivation. If not for Ye Qingtang’s plot for Lu Xiuwen to automatically return the Shangyue Fire Tripod, it would really be difficult for him to find a way out.

“Really? That’s good then.” Ye Qingtang smiled earnestly. Yun Shu’s fall in her previous life had always been a sore point for her. If she could witness him overcoming the disaster and pulling himself together in this lifetime, she would be relieved.

As they were talking, Su Wan and a few other disciples walked past. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The moment Su Wan saw Ye Qingtang and Yun Shu, her face turned a little pale, and she looked away instinctively.

“Junior Sister Su, do you know that there were many shocking incidents in the outer sect recently?” Liu Yue, who was walking beside Su Wan, did not notice Ye Qingtang and Yun Shu and spoke her mind.

“What incidents?” Su Wan asked.

“A few days ago, Elder Huang from the outer sect’s Sword Faction accepted an amazing genius from the Tian Fu family clan called Yuan Wei. I heard that Yuan Wei has a green spirit root, and his natural endowments were brilliant. The Tian Fu family clan devoted much effort to raise him into an extremely skilled person.” Liu Yue replied.

A disciple who was walking with them was suddenly energetic. “Yuan Wei from the Tian Fu family clan? I’ve heard of him before. Although he did not enter a sect previously, he had a mighty figure as his master. He is highly skilled and is very famous in the Dong Qin area where the Tian Fu family clan was at. People said he is a rare genius in Dong Qin.”

“Obviously. If he did not have the skills, why would Elder Huang make an exception to accept him into the outer sect? I even heard that Elder Huang thought very highly of him. Not only did Elder Huang accept Yuan Wei as a disciple, but Elder Huang also made an exception to allow Yuan Wei to participate in the inner sect assessment this year.” Liu Yue chipped in.

“He just entered the sect but can participate in the inner sect assessment? He must be really powerful. If the rumors are true and Yuan Wei is able to enter the top ten in the ranking charts in the inner sect assessment this year, his future is really limitless.”

Liu Yue nodded. Just as she was to say something to Su Wan, she suddenly saw Su Wan’s stiff expression. Liu Yue instinctively looked around and suddenly saw Ye Qingtang and Yun Shu.

Immediately, Liu Yue scoffed. “However, that is not considered a shocking incident. In the outer sect of Xuanling Sect, there is still another shocking incident which is bigger and more interesting.”

“Oh? What is it? Tell me about it?”

Liu Yue looked at Ye Qingtang and let out a cold laugh. “What else can it be? It is just that a certain person over-estimated her abilities. After picking up a treasure and presenting it to an elder, she gained a generous number of Xuanming points for nothing.”
