Chapter 1194: Occupied (2)

“Holy Lady, with my capabilities, I can kill more enemies on the battlefield, reducing our enemy numbers!” said the Blood Moon Elder.

“In that case, consider these two children as your battlefield.” Ye Qingtang’s words seemed to have a deeper meaning.

Before the Blood Moon Elder could continue, Ye Qingtang said seriously, “Tell me if you can do this!”

“I, Hong Heqing, can do this!” In the end, the Blood Moon Elder gritted his teeth and nodded. His voice was like the crash of thunder.

He did not know what the Holy Lady was thinking, but if Ye Qingtang spoke so sternly and seriously, then he trusted her arrangements.

“Very well… Little You Yun is the future of this mainland… right now… I hand the future over to you.” Ye Qingtang laughed softly.

The Blood Moon Elder’s heart quavered, and he immediately said, “I will not disappoint the Holy Lady!”

“Thank you.” Ye Qingtang took a step back and bowed to the Blood Moon Elder.

“Holy Lady…” The Blood Moon Elder looked at Ye Qingtang. He could not describe his feelings, but it was as if she was handing over a legacy.

“I need to deal with the approaching main force of Ancient You Clan stationed in the south. I am unable to protect them. You are the most powerful among us all. I will only be at ease… if these two children are in your care.” Ye Qingtang smiled slightly at the Blood Moon Elder.

With that, Ye Qingtang turned and left.

“Mo… ther…”

As he looked at Ye Qingtang’s disappearing figure, little Luo Xue’s eyes became misty. He subconsciously reached out for Ye Qingtang but finally withdrew his hand.

Although little Luo Xue was still young, he had a vague idea of what was going on. At that moment, he needed to hear from his own mother…

“Be good. Both of you are to come with grandfather… Grandfather will certainly take good care of you, alright?” The Blood Moon Elder bent down and put little Luo Xue and Little You Yun on his palm.

“Mm!” Little You Yun nodded.

“Mo… ther…” Little Luo Xue blinked his wet eyes and looked at the Blood Moon Elder.

“Your mother… has more important things to attend to. When you’ve… grown up, you must follow your mother’s example!” The Blood Moon Elder looked at the two small children.

…

Before long, scouts announced that the Ancient You Clan’s main force in the south was no more than a hundred miles from Heaven City.

Ye Qingtang was silent for a long time after receiving this news. Then, her eyes swept across everyone present.

“Twelve Peak Masters of Falling Sky Valley, receive your orders!” Ye Qingtang said. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“We hear and obey!” The twelve Peak Masters said seriously.

“Ye Family disciples, receive your orders!” said Ye Qingtang.

“We hear and obey!” Hundreds of Ye Family disciples replied in unison.

“Ye Family branch masters, receive your orders!” said Ye Qingtang.

“We hear and obey!” The many Ye Family Yang Lords advanced.

“Elders of the Ye Family, receive your orders!” said Ye Qingtang.

“We hear and obey!” Daoist Zijin, Elder Bai Kui, and the other Yang Lords looked determined.

“Si Family Yang Lords, receive your orders!” said Ye Qingtang.

“We hear and obey!” The many Yang Lords from the Si Family cupped their fists.

Ye Qingtang said slowly, “The main force of the Ancient You Clan is no more than a hundred miles away. In this battle, all of us could die.”

Everyone present already knew that.

“If anyone wants to back out now, they can immediately leave Heaven City without being pursued!” Ye Qingtang said.

After a moment, no one responded.

“Very well, thank you everyone.” Ye Qingtang slowly bowed to everyone present.
