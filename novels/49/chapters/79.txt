Chapter 80: Cleansing (1)

Ye Qingtang gave the incessant Duan Tianrao a cold look, twisting a slight sneer across her lips.

“Mr. Duan, all good things come to an end, and this is it for us. Farewell.” With that said, Ye Qingtang did not give him any chance to respond and had the attendants carry him away in a jiffy.

Duan Tianrao was in a state of shock as he gaped in disbelief at Ye Qingtang’s apathetic response. However, before he could even make a comeback, he was carried out of the Ye residence already.

After that, the people who remained in the courtyard were: Ye Qingtang, the little dragonoid, Ye Ling, the four assassins and the Great Elder, whom was restrained by the Second Elder.

“The people have already left. Guess it’s high time we make an exit as well?” The leader of the assassins suggested.

Ye Ling furrowed his brow at the leader’s statement.

Ye Qingtang gave a laugh instead: “Good job. I’ll make sure the full payment reaches Qin Luo’s Pavilion tomorrow. Have a good rest.”

The leader replied in kind: “Thank you Miss Ye. We look forward to your patronage again. Good night.”

With that said, the assassins vanished beyond the walls of the courtyard.

Every word of their conversation was heard clearly by the rest of the people present, including the Great Elder, who had awoken in the midst.

“Ye Qingtang! How dare you set this up against me!” The Great Elder glared daggers at her, like a vicious beast ready to maul her to pieces.

Ye Ling and the Second Elder were astonished. They initially believed the assassins were hired by the Great Elder, but to think… this was all a set-up by Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang regarded the Great Elder with amusement.

“A set-up? My, you do have a way with words. But isn’t this letter written personally by you? All I did was changing two words.” Ye Qingtang flapped the letter in front of the Great Elder’s face.

“You!” The Great Elder, furious beyond words, gnashed his teeth at her.

Ye Qingtang sneered in return: “Your evil deeds are your undoing. Soon, everyone in the city will come to know of your treachery. Do you still think you can walk away scott-free?” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Great Elder. You’ve committed a heinous crime and in accordance to the decree of the noble Houses, we hereby sentence you to death.” Ye Qingtang smirked while she recited the judgment.

The Great Elder continued to glare at Ye Qingtang, whilst sneering: “Sentenced to death by the mere likes of you imbeciles? I dare you! My granddaughter and the Cloud-breakers will see to my vengeance!”

Ye Ling and the Second Elder had a look of concern on their faces when the Great Elder threatened them with that statement.

Indeed, even after exposing the Great Elder’s crime in public, thereby granting his execution but… he still had Ye You’s backing.

If the judgment was made known to her, things might turn ugly in time to come.

Especially since Ye You became the disciple of the Cloud-breaker’s sovereign, if she was to involve them in this matter, the outcome would be uncertain.

However, Ye Qingtang remained unperturbed and grinned like a Cheshire cat instead, “Oh about that, I hate to break this to you. After you’re executed, what we’ll announce to the public will go something like this: Although you’ve committed a heinous crime, in lieu of your past contributions, the benevolent us have decided to just revoke your position as Great Elder and incarcerate you for a period of time. We’ll ensure no one will know you’re already executed, including your granddaughter. She’s far away at the Cloud-breakers. How many years do you think it’ll take for her to complete her training and return here personally to find out you’re dead?”

ED: Ooh, could this finally be it?!
