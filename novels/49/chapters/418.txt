Ye You looked away in satisfaction and immediately left with Elder Qu on the Nine-Tailed Spirit Phoenix.

After they left, Fu Lingtian finally stood up and headed in the direction he came from.

However, Fu Lingtian did not know that Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Sect Elder had already heard his conversation with Ye You. Once everyone was gone, the two of them finally walked out of the forest.

As Ye Qingtang watched Fu Lingtian’s back view, her eyes were more serious than ever.

They originally thought that Fu Lingtian was related to the Blood Moon Sect and thus wanted to test him, yet unexpectedly, the truth was way scarier than what they imagined.

“Little Qu is actually still alive.” The Blood Moon Sect Elder’s expression turned increasingly grave at that instant.

“Was Elder Qu back there from your Blood Moon Sect?” Ye Qingtang looked at the Blood Moon Sect Elder, and her heart was unable to calm down after a long time. There was too much information in the conversation between Ye You and Fu Lingtian: not only was the Blood Moon Sect involved, but there was also the secret of seizing a spirit root. What surprised Ye Qingtang the most was…

From what Ye You and Fu Lingtian said, Fu Lingtian seemed to be a Yunxiao Sect disciple.

However, this Yunxiao Sect disciple actually concealed himself in Qinglin Sect secretly in order to seize Qinglin Sect disciples’ spirit roots and nourish himself.

“Little Qu is also an elder from the Blood Moon Sect. When Blood Moon Sect was annihilated back then, he was clearly the one who led troops to battle against Yunxiao Sect. I originally thought he died for the sect, but…” The Blood Moon Sect Elder clenched his teeth quietly and continued. “This bastard actually betrayed Blood Moon Sect and turned to Yunxiao Sect!”

The Blood Moon Sect Elder was not a fool. Elder Qu’s face and body were exactly the same as before. Thus, it was clear that this was Elder Qu’s original body.

Although the Blood Moon Sect’s cultivation technique could allow their soul to live on forever, it was impossible for the body that was killed to be restored. To live again, the only way was to seize a body as the Blood Moon Sect Elder had.

That year, it was Elder Qu who led the battle against Yunxiao Sect, yet he appeared beside a Yunxiao Sect disciple well and alive, and from the way Ye You addressed him, it was easy to tell that Elder Qu had already turned to Yunxiao Sect.

“No wonder I felt that Fu Lingtian had my sect’s aura of the evil spirit. So it’s because he learned the Spirit Seizure Technique!” The Blood Moon Sect Elder scoffed coldly.

“Spirit Seizure Technique?” Ye Qingtang frowned slightly.

“This Spirit Seizure Technique is an esoteric cultivation technique of my sect. This technique is about digging other’s spirit root and using the cultivation technique to convert it into one’s energy from which one can nourish his own spirit root.” The Blood Moon Sect Elder narrowed his eyes and continued on.

“You’re also aware that there’s no such thing as stealing a spirit root for one’s personal use, but the Spirit Seizure Technique can work. Using this kind of cultivation technique to obtain others’ spirit roots and nourish oneself could strengthen one’s spirit root and even allow the spirit root’s grade to directly improve.”

The more the Blood Moon Sect Elder thought about it, the more livid he was. While Blood Moon Sect was condemned as an evil sect, he had never heard of any member of the sect betraying the sect and defecting to the enemy when the Blood Moon Sect was annihilated. Yet… a thousand years later, he actually discovered such a traitor!

Ye Qingtang was shocked. She only knew that everyone in the world deemed the act of seizing spirit root from others as contemptuous, and no one had ever done such a thing. However, thinking about it now, apart from Ye You, she had never heard of anyone seizing the spirit root from others in her previous life.
