Chapter 795 Spank Your Bottom (2)

Alarmed, Qin Long said hurriedly, “Guard Long! You must not listen to this person’s nonsense. He seized His Majesty now, and it’s already a capital offense. Even if you kill me, he will not release His Majesty!” 1

Long Jiang’s brows were slightly furrowed.

Sensing the arrival of a crisis, Qin Long did not give Long Jiang any time to think and glared at Ye Qingtang immediately. “What an audacious traitor! How dare you threaten His Majesty’s safety! Men, capture him.”

Qin Long’s yell stunned everyone.

The guards had a blank expression.

“Do you all not care about your Emperor’s life and death anymore?” Ye Qingtang suddenly asked Qin Long.

Qin Long snickered, although he still put on a righteous expression on his face.

“It’s simply impossible for someone like you to release His Majesty. Although His Majesty is young, he is still the ruler of the Nine Nights Dynasty and would never submit to you. Men, it is a must to kill this traitorous peasant today.”

Qin Long knew that if there was an option, Long Jiang would definitely use him to exchange for the little Emperor’s life.

But if he did not do anything, he would be waiting for death!

“Qin Long, you’re insolent!” Long Jiang hooted at Qin Long with a glare.

However, Qin Long did not bother with Long Jiang and immediately took out the military seal which he carried on him.

“The military seal is in my hand, and no one can defy my orders! Guards, receive my command: use all your might to kill this traitor!”

“You!” Long Jiang was boiling with fury and wanted to step forward. However, the counter-damage effect caused him to spit out blood and his footsteps to be unstable.

The Nine Nights Dynasty had long been under Qin Long’s control, and the little Emperor was merely an Emperor in name who did not hold any power. With the military seal in Qin Long’s hands currently, the garrison troops received the command immediately and gathered towards Ye Qingtang.

The little Emperor looked at the soldiers who surrounded him with widened eyes that were filled with disbelief.

“Qin Long, are you crazy? I’m still in this lowly… this person’s hand. How dare you ignore my safety?” The little Emperor was not so foolish this time.

A murderous intent flashed across Qin Long’s eyes while his face was ice cold. “Your Majesty, the entire Nine Nights Dynasty will definitely be grateful to you for your grace in contributing your body for the nation.”

The little Emperor’s eyes almost popped out from glaring

Having expected all of this, Ye Qingtang watched on emotionlessly.

She suddenly lifted her hands and directly threw the furious little Emperor to the Blood Moon Elder beside her before sprinting to the front of Qin Long.

Qin Long did not even have any time to react and only saw a shadow flashing by him.

In the next second.

A light suddenly flashed by his eyes.

Blood spouted out like a fountain.

Qin Long widened his eyes as he held onto his slit throat in disbelief. Large gushes of blood flowed out through his fingers. He retreated in a flurry and crashed onto the royal sedan behind him before falling on the floor.

Never would Qin Long have thought that after controlling Nine Nights Dynasty for years, he would actually die in this young man’s hands.

In just a moment, all color was drain from Qin Long’s face, and the last ray of luster in his ambition-filled eyes extinguished silently.

Qin Long was dead.

Long Jiang had complicated feelings as he looked at the dead Qin Long. He immediately looked up at Ye Qingtang and said, “Qin Long is dead already. You can release His Majesty now.”

Ye Qingtang cast Long Jiang a look and replied. “I said that I’d release your Emperor if you kill him.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“You!” Long Jiang was shaken.
