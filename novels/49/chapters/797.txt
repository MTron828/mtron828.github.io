Chapter 798 Grand Imperial Sire (3)

“Finally… Finally found you…” The Grand Imperial Sire’s eyes were filled with agitation as he looked at Ye Qingtang.

“After your mother gave birth to you, she asked me to send you to a safe place. I didn’t know what she is worried about and could only listen to her orders. After you were sent away, your mother left.”

“But… But I never thought that…” The Grand Imperial Sire shut his eyes tightly as agony filled his face.

“I ordered people to send you away but never thought that those people never returned or reported back. Afterward, I assigned people to investigate, but we completely lost news of you… They only found the corpses of the people who sent you away…

“I thought that you met a mishap… but unexpectedly… you’re still alive… still alive… This is great… This is great… Otherwise, if you died, I have no face to face your mother.” The Grand Imperial Sire clutched onto the blanket tightly as he looked at Ye Qingtang with a mix of surprise and delight.

“Is… she really my mother?” Although she had guessed it, this outcome caused her to have mixed feelings.

“There’s no wrong in this. You resemble her a lot, and this jade pendant was found on you. Judging from your age, you should be her daughter.” The Grand Imperial Sire nodded with certainty.

That lady was a rare beauty in this world. If there was no blood relation, how could anyone look like her?

Ye Qingtang sorted out her thoughts for a while.

Qu Xiangyang recovered from the surprise and immediately kowtowed to Ye Qingtang.

“I was unaware that you’re our Young Lord. Please pardon me for my offense.”

Long Jiang knelt on the floor as well and kowtowed to Ye Qingtang. “I am guilty as I have offended you, Young Lord. Please punish me.”

Ye Qingtang looked at the two people in astonishment.

On the other hand, the Grand Imperial Sire’s face was full of smiles.

“They’re originally guards whom your mother nurtured. Ever since your mother left, Qu Xiangyang was unwilling to remain in the palace while Long Jiang was instructed by your mother to protect my safety. Although he is loyal, he is a little dull. If he offended you, I am all to blame.”

Kneeling on the floor, Long Jiang was filled with regret.

Had he known earlier that Ye Qingtang was her daughter… he would not dare to hurt her at all even if he died.

“Rise. I don’t blame you all,” Ye Qingtang said.

Qu Xiangyang and Long Jiang rose slowly. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Ye Qingtang continued asking. “Grand Imperial Sire, so do you know where my mother went?”

The Grand Imperial Sire sighed and said, “She has never said much about herself. I can only feel that she seems to be hiding from someone. She once said that she is not from this mainland and that she came here for the child in her womb.”

“Since you were delivered, she left after settling you down. It seems that she returned to her original homeland, but as for where exactly that place is, I do not know.” The Grand Imperial Sire shook his head helplessly.

Ye Qingtang’s heart weighed down slightly.

That lady was really her mother.

Others may not know about that lady’s homeland, but she knew.

It was the Central Mainland!

“Alright.” Ye Qingtang’s doubts were finally resolved. As expected, she still had to go to the Central Mainland to find out about her mother’s identity and origin.

In her previous life, her foster father died early and did not tell her about her identity. As a result, even though Ye Qingtang went to the Central Mainland before in her previous life, she did not know that her birth mother was just there.
