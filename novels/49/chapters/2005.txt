Chapter 2006: Working Together (1)

“All good?” Ye Qingtang looked at Ling Yan, speaking at a low volume that only the both of them could hear.

A short nod from Ling Yan signaled for Ye Qingtang to leave first.

It wasn’t likely for this incident to just end so easily.

Ye Qingtang was afraid that they would be exposed and she quickly flew away with Ling Yan.

“This valley is only one of the Ancient You Clan’s locations. I’m sure the Crimson League did this to assert dominance,” Ling Yan said.

“Well, there’s no way the Ancient You Clan can find the Netherworld Ring and hand it over. They will not be able to make peace.” Ye Qingtang was elated.

After all, she had achieved her aims of dragging the Crimson League down.

Some time after Ye Qingtang returned to the Temple of Shadows, she used another voice transmission stone to contract You Qiong.

“Holy Lord.” You Qiong’s voice came from the voice transmission stone.

“How is it?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“You’re indeed formidable, Holy Lord. The Crimson League is at odds with the Ancient You Clan now.” You Qiong sounded respectful. He was convinced that his life was in Ye Qingtang’s hands and didn’t dare try anything.

“Oh? Why is that?” Ye Qingtang asked.

You Qiong explained everything that happened in the valley after Ye Qingtang left.

It was just as Ye Qingtang and Ling Yan had expected. Bai Zhi had massacred the entire Ancient You Clan’s valley.

The Ancient You Clan had intended to train youths in the valley but they eventually moved most of the equipment and youths somewhere else because of the Jiang family’s incident.

Fewer than 20 powerful youths guarding the place. They weren’t of the highest grade and naturally was no match for Bai Zhi.

It only took less than 12 hours for the Ancient You Clan’s valley to be wiped out.

Bai Zhi left a letter behind in the Ancient You Clan’s valley after killing everyone. She ordered the Ancient You Clan to return the Netherworld Ring, if not, they would be undermining the Crimson League’s authority and the Crimson League would declare war on the Ancient You Clan.

Ye Qingtang was delighted when she learned of the news, but she remained calm on the outside. “Mm.”

On the other hand, You Qiong figured out that Ye Qingtang had planned everything when he noticed that she was exceptionally calm. The Holy Lord of Shadows was terrifying.

The Crimson League and Ancient You Clan would never have imagined that their conflict was all planned by the Temple of Shadows. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Got it. You did a good job. You can have your freedom once you complete everything,” Ye Qingtang said.

You Qiong didn’t dare say a word.

Ye Qingtang was in a good mood after hanging up.

The Ancient You Clan had fallen straight into her trap. They thought that they had snatched up something good but it was some trouble for them instead. Now, the Crimson League was convinced that the Ancient You Clan has something up their sleeves and they are determined to assert dominance.

It could be resolved if the Ancient You Clan can find the Netherworld Ring and hand it over to the Crimson League, but they couldn’t possibly do that. There was no authentic Netherworld Ring. The Netherworld Ring that the Ancient You Clan had snatched over was a fake. After all, Ye Qingtang had intentionally let them snatch it.

The Ancient You Clan would never be able to clear their name now.

...

Three days later.

The three alien races of the Crimson League appeared outside the Temple of Shadows.

They weren’t as arrogant as before. When they stood outside the Temple of Shadows, their behavior was surprisingly polite.
