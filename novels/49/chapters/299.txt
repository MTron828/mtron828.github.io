Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The disciples really widened their horizons today. The treasures that outer sect disciples like them saw in the Xuanming Pavilion were only the tip of the iceberg, and being able to see the legendary Blazing Flame Sword today really astonished them.

Ye Qingtang looked at the Blazing Flame Sword in her hand with twinkling eyes. Although she felt that this sword was really good, the sword had a fire nature and was rather unsuitable for her.

The warden sharply sensed the regret that passed Ye Qingtang’s eyes and raised a brow. He thought that Ye Qingtang was perhaps still unsatisfied. Thinking of the fifty thousand Xuanming points in her hands, he made up his mind and walked to the cabinet beside. He stretched his hand to take down a dusty, long brocade box from the top of the cabinet.

“Although that Blazing Flame Sword is good, it does not hold a candle to this item. A truly good item is laying inside this box.” As he spoke, he lightly knocked on the brocade box that had been tightly shut for a long time while looking at Ye Qingtang meaningfully.

With that said, many disciples were attracted over. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

To them, the Blazing Flame Sword was already extremely precious, yet the warden actually said that the item in the box was a hundred times more precious than the Blazing Flame Sword?

What exactly was it?

How could it be this powerful?

The disciples widened their eyes at that moment, fearful that they would miss out on the chance to see an unparalleled divine weapon should they be the slightest distracted.

Ye Qingtang was at a loss of whether to cry or laugh when she saw the warden’s behavior and speculated that he was aware of her “net worth” for him to show her three treasures so generously.

The warden slowly opened the box in front of everyone. He only lifted the lid a little, but a cold air quietly seeped out through that small gap.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes dilated slightly in shock. She faintly sensed an unusual aura being slowly emitted out from the brocade box.

As the brocade box was opened, the surrounding disciples widened their eyes as well, wanting to see what kind of rare treasure was being kept in it.

When the brocade box was fully opened, everyone was taken aback by its content.

In the simple and gorgeous brocade box laid an unattractive long, black sword. Its scabbard was made using an uncertain material which caused its dull appearance. Compared to the previous Dragon Spring Sword and the Blazing Flame Sword, the sword in the box seemed rather old.

“What is this sword? There seems to be nothing special about it.” A disciple could not help but mumble.

The warden looked up and scoffed at that mumbling disciple. “Nothing special?”

The disciple looked down, not daring to utter another sentence.

The warden looked back down at the black sword and slowly took it out from the brocade box.

Ye Qingtang noticed that when the warden held the sword, the cold air lingering around the black sword gradually crept up to the warden’s hand.

The warden looked at the black sword and then at Ye Qingtang. “Have you heard of Chi Xue, the Invincible Slayer?”

Ye Qingtang was stunned.

Chi Xue, the Invincible Slayer?

The warden smiled. “Hundred years ago, Chi Xue was born, and he was named the Slayer, as there was bloodshed everywhere he went. Many mighty figures were slaughtered by him, and their skulls were hung on his carriage. Death was in the air for a century. The sword he used is called the Demonic Blood Sword and is one of the rare demonic weapons on earth.”
