“So what if it is?” Ye Qingtang scoffed.

The Yunxiao Sect elder never hid his thoughts; he did take a fancy on the Black Heaven Water in Ye Qingtang’s hand.

“Fellow, hand the Black Heaven Water to me!” The Yunxiao Sect Elder’s expression was cold as ice as he stretched a hand out to Ye Qingtang.

“Hand it to you?” Ye Qingtang found it funny. “This Black Heaven Water is mine. Why must I hand it to you?”

At this instant, more and more super sects’ disciples and wardens noticed the Black Heaven Water in Ye Qingtang’s hands.

“Divide the Black Heaven Water with everyone!”

“That’s right. We risked our lives to enter this mysterious palace and almost died in here. How can we let you enjoy this big destiny alone!”

“Black Heaven Water... All of us should have a share. It should be divided amongst all of us!”

Many disciples and wardens shouted angrily. This Black Heaven Water was extremely rare, and now that they had seen it, how would they let it go?

“Ha...” Ye Qingtang’s lips curled, and a cold sneer appeared on her face. As her eyes swept across everyone at the scene, she said, “If not for me, all of you would have died in your mental demons. Yet, you all still want me to share this Black Heaven Water out equally now?”

“What a joke! We relied on our own abilities and walked out of our mental demons. It has nothing to do with you. You must want to have this Black Heaven Water for yourself alone!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“That’s right. Aren’t you too selfish? If you don’t divide the Black Heaven Water out today, don’t blame us for being heartless!”

Ye Qingtang could not help but recall her past life as she looked at the *ssh*le faces in the palace.

In her past life, she had seen too many of these scenes because of the Heart of the Demon God. Today, others forced her to hand the Black Heaven Water over, but in her past life, it was to force her to hand the Heart of the Demon God over...

“Ha... Sure.”

Ye Qingtang scoffed coldly and directly threw that golden bottle to the Yunxiao Sect Elder.

“Currently, the Black Heaven Water is no longer with me. If you all want it, ask for it from the Yunxiao Sect Elder.” Ye Qingtang sneered.

Ye Qingtang had already expected this situation. Thus, she had already stored the Black Heaven Water in her space ring earlier on. As for the golden bottle, she had already changed it into consumable clear water a long time ago.

However, the Black Heaven Water had been stored in the golden bottle for a long time, and even if it was replaced with clear water, the smell of the Black Heaven Water was still extremely strong. Thus, no one would know that Ye Qingtang had already switched it.

After everyone saw Ye Qingtang hand the Black Heaven Water over to the Yunxiao Sect Elder, everyone’s eyes shifted away from Ye Qingtang and landed on the Yunxiao Sect Elder.

At that moment, the Yunxiao Sect Elder treated it as a treasure and kept it immediately.

“Yunxiao Sect Elder, what is the meaning of this!”

“Do you want to hog the Black Heaven Water for yourself?!”

Seeing that the Yunxiao Sect Elder did not intend to hand the Black Heaven Water over, everyone apart from the Yunxiao Sect disciples was infuriated.

While the Yunxiao Sect disciples were angry as well, they did not dare to speak their minds out. After all, he was an elder from their sect, and they could not say anything.

“Hmph!” The Yunxiao Sect Elder sneered. “A hundred years ago, my Yunxiao Sect once had a portion of Black Heaven Water but lost it later on. In my opinion, the Black Heaven Water in this Hell of Avicinaraka was the one that Yunxiao Sect lost back then. Is there anything wrong for me to retrieve my sect’s item?”

“What did you say?!”

“Yunxiao Sect Elder, do you treat us as fools?! When did your sect have the Black Heaven Water? Even if it had the Black Heaven Water, it has been lost for hundreds of years. What has it got to do with the Black Heaven Water in this mystic realm!”

People from other super sects in the second palace sneered coldly.
