Chapter 2292: Returning To The Academy (2)

The teenagers sped back to the Netherworld Academy with their emboldened ambitions.

After arriving at the academy, they didn’t notice anything strange. They just hung onto Ye Qing, chattering the entire way.

In their excitement, they didn’t notice that their appearance had captured the attention of several Netherworld Academy people. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Boss, we’ll head back to rest first. We’ll come and find you tomorrow morning!” It had been a long journey and they needed to rest. After bidding farewell to Ye Qing, they returned to their own lodgings.

Similarly, Ye Qingtang went back to her room and washed up, changing out of her dusty clothes.

At this moment, there was a loud knock on her door.

“Ye Qing! Come out!”

Di Nuo’s voice rang out.

Ye Qingtang had never got along with Di Nuo and thought he was here to make trouble. Putting on her coat, she opened the door.

However…

Di Nuo was not the only one outside.

Several wardens were gathered behind Di Nuo and they were all dressed in the same uniform. They were from the discipline hall.

“Teacher Di Nuo, what is the meaning of this?” Ye Qingtang asked when she saw the stern expression on Di Nuo’s face.

“Ye Qing, you fled after committing a crime and even lured Lei Yan and the other students to go out and create trouble. Confess your wrongdoings!” Di Nuo glared at Ye Qing with a cold eye.

It hadn’t been too long since Ye Qingtang’s return to the Netherworld Academy and someone already informed Di Nuo of her return. He had rushed over with several wardens from the discipline hall, ready to arrest Ye Qingtang.

“Flee after committing a crime? What crime have I committed? Why would I need to flee?” Ye Qingtang asked calmly.

“Have you forgotten about Zhang Qiqiu?” Di Nuo asked.

Ye Qingtang looked at Di Nuo and said in a cold voice, “Teacher Di Nuo, Zhang Qiqiu’s bloodline should have already recovered. Do you not find it rather ridiculous to still be trying to blame me for that?”

Di Nuo was stunned.

“How did you know?”

Zhang Qiqiu’s bloodline had indeed recovered over a month ago. But Ye Qingtang had left the Netherworld Academy much earlier. How did she know?

“I was the one who gave him the elixir so of course I know,” Ye Qingtang answered.

Di Nuo narrowed his eyes.

“So what if his bloodline had recovered? The academy had yet to revoke your punishment when you brought those students out without telling anyone. How do you explain that?”

“Netherworld Academy teachers are allowed to bring students out for external training.”

Di Nuo only laughed at her words.

“That’s right. Netherworld Academy teachers can do so. But… you cannot. The Vice-President allowed you to enter the academy but you are not an official teacher here. You don’t have that right. You flouted the school rules again and again and the Netherworld Academy would never retain such an immoral influence like you. You are to leave the Netherworld Academy immediately. You are never to step inside this place ever again!”

It came as no surprise that Di Nuo didn’t like Ye Qing. To him, having such a teacher in the Netherworld Academy was just a blemish on their reputation.

“The Vice-President has already given me full authority to handle your matter. Ye Qing, you have no right to stand on Netherworld Academy grounds. Scram and get out immediately. Do not tarnish our clean grounds with your atrocities.”

Ye Qingtang gazed impassively at the malicious expression on Di Nuo’s face.

“You don’t have the final say over whether I have the right.”

Di Nuo’s face darkened.

“Ye Qing, don’t make me use force!”
