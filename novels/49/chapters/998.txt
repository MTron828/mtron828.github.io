Chapter 999 Three Steps (2)

“You wish to injure me with this lousy piece of metal?” As Ye Qingtang spoke, she exerted power in her palm, and a crisp “clang” sounded. Under everyone’s watch, Clan Master Long’s superior yellow-grade weapon crushed.

This crush directly turned the sword into fine powder...

“This... is impossible...” Clan Master Long was aghast.

“It’s my turn.” Ye Qingtang looked at Clan Master Long and said with a light chuckle.

After hearing what Ye Qingtang said, Clan Master Long was alarmed. Almost instinctively, he retreated backward quickly and pulled a distance from Ye Qingtang.

“If you can withstand my three steps, I’ll pardon your Long Family,” Ye Qingtang said without emotions.

“Three steps?!”

Everyone at the scene was taken aback and completely could not comprehend what Ye Qingtang was saying.

“This is the first step.” With that, Ye Qingtang moved her leg and took a small step forward.

This one step had such oppressive air like that of the very first aura since the creation of the universe, and it seemed to reverse Heaven and Earth.

Everyone watched in disbelief and did not know what happened other than the fact that Clan Master Long shuddered and that his complexion was ghastly pale.

“Not bad. This is the second step.”

Immediately, an unknown smile formed on Ye Qingtang’s face as she took another step forward.

As she took the second step, blood actually seeped out of Clan Master Long’s mouth.

“Very good. This is the third step.”

Afterward, Ye Qingtang moved her legs once again and made the third step.

“Ow!”

As Ye Qingtang took her third step, a mouthful of blood spewed out of Clan Master Long’s mouth.

“Father!”

Long Rui was startled. Her father was a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord... How could this be...

At this very instant, disbelief was etched on everyone’s faces. A Yin Yang Perfected Lord actually used three steps to cause a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord to vomit blood!

“It seems that the so-called unparalleled mighty Clan Master Long is unable to withstand my three steps.” Ye Qingtang shook her head in disappointment.

Clank!

Very quickly, there was a sound of an unsheathed sword.

The Regicide Sky Blade appeared in Ye Qingtang’s hand.

“Your Long Family likes Dharma treasures a lot. What do you all think about this sword then?” Ye Qingtang held the Regicide Sky Blade in front of Clan Master Long.

“This... black-grade... black-grade weapon?!”

After seeing Ye Qingtang’s Regicide Sky Blade, everyone at the scene was beyond shocked, much less Clan Master Long.

A black-grade weapon was not what a yellow-grade weapon could be compared to; even millions of top yellow-grade weapons were inferior to the lowest level black-grade weapon!

No one thought that Ye Qingtang even possessed such a weapon!

“Clan Master Long... and everyone here.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Ye Qingtang’s eyes swept the crowd, and she snickered softly. “A sword should be used this way.”

As Ye Qingtang finished her sentence, the Regicide Sky Blade in her hand waved down.

Swoosh!

A scarlet gleam rushed into the sky.

Before everyone’s shocked eyes, that sword gleam completely shattered the headquarters of the Duan Family and Long Family into ruins.

SSSSS...

Everyone gasped at the sight.

“Outrageous... The level of the treasure on this lady is actually this frightening!”

At this instant, several Long Family elders were seething. In their eyes, the reason why Ye Qingtang could harm Clan Master Long, a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord, was only because of the treasure on her!
