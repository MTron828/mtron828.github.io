Chapter 950 Return to Lin Town (1)

After parting from Ling Yan, Ye Qingtang rushed to Xuanling Sect. As for what Ling Yan did afterward, she did not have an inkling about it. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

In Formidable Heavens Dynasty, Ye Qingtang looked at the little white tiger in her arms and subsequently scanned her surroundings. Her brows furrowed deeply as she spoke slowly. “Where’s… my wolf?!”

“Wolf?”

After hearing Ye Qingtang, the little white tiger was dumbfounded as well, and it instinctively inspected the surroundings. “Right, where’s your wolf?”

Previously when they were bidding farewell to Ling Yan, the silver wolf was still following Ye Qingtang obediently. Why did it disappear in the blink of an eye?!

“I am asking you. Where’s my wolf?” Ye Qingtang looked at the little white tiger.

“Why are you asking me? How would I know where your wolf is? Do I help you to look after your wolf?” The little white tiger was baffled. It was a Fiendcelestial Beast, not a wolf-guarding beast!

Ye Qingtang did not argue with the little white tiger and instead chose to trace back their footsteps. After searching the borders of the Formidable Heavens Dynasty for several days, the silver wolf was still nowhere to be found.

“As clearly seen, your wolf ran away,” the little white tiger looked at Ye Qingtang and said.

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly as she pondered.

Such a case was not rare; it was not the first time either…

They had not found any traces of the silver wolf over the past few days, and it might have run off somewhere as it did before.

After a fruitless search, Ye Qingtang could only give up as she thought that the silver wolf would return soon like the other time.

Anyway…

It was considered a common affair for Xiao Guai to runaway.

Presently, Ye Qingtang had entered the Formidable Heavens Dynasty.

However, her current mood was different from when she left initially.

She was forced and had no choice but to leave previously, but now that she had returned to the Formidable Heavens Dynasty again, no one could do anything to her.

“Where are we going now?”

The little white tiger poked its head out and asked curiously.

After hearing the little white tiger’s question, Ye Qingtang was in deep thought.

Ye Qingtang originally intended to head to Xuanling Sect first but eventually decided to return to Lin Town first.

It had already been more than a year since she left the Ye family of Lin Town and headed to Xuanling Sect to cultivate.

With a rough calculation, it had been almost two years since Ye Qingtang saw her father, Ye Ling, and she missed him dearly.

There was a distance of several thousands of miles from the borders of Formidable Heavens Dynasty to Xuanling Sect and from Xuanling Sect to Lin Town.

If an ordinary cultivator wished to rush to Lin Town from their current location, he would require at least a month even if he traveled day and night.

Nonetheless, with Ye Qingtang’s current cultivation base, she returned to Lin Town in only half a day.

There were not many changes in this small town.

However, the town seemed to be more bustling and prosperous than two years ago, and businesses could be seen everywhere.

“Ever since the Long family came to Lin Town, the Ye family and Si family have been on the decline.”

Ye Qingtang heard a few people conversing when she entered the town.

In her previous life, she was chased after for her life by the Great Elder after her father died. Without any other means, she fled from Lin Town and never returned since then. As such, she never heard of any news regarding Lin Town.

As for what Lin Town experienced afterward, Ye Qingtang was not clear.

It was thus strange for her when she heard people mentioning = the Long family.

What was the background of this Long family?
