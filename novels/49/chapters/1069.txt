Chapter 1070 Casual Stroll

Perfected Xuanchen was doubtful but did not dare to speak as he wished when just inches away from an unparalleled Yang Lord.

“Since that’s the case, please enter Falling Sky Valley, Yang Lord.”

Perfected Xuanchen immediately took a small step back and gestured to Ye Qingtang politely.

Ye Qingtang did not say a word and entered Falling Sky Valley.

After knowing that a Yang Lord appeared in Falling Sky Valley, both Peak Masters of Water Cut Peak and Blue Cloud Peak showed up.

However, Ye Qingtang only talked to Perfected Xuanchen and did not really bother with the other Peak Masters.

At this instant, Perfected Xuanchen was walking in the lead while everyone else was beside Ye Qingtang and did not dare to say anything.

No one was clear of this young Yang Lord’s intentions for coming to Falling Sky Valley, and Perfected Xuanchen could only be extremely cautious.

However, the Peerless School warden and the other three Peak Masters were rather impatient, especially the Peerless School warden. Outside, he represented Peerless School, but the person who accompanied the foreign Yang Lord was not them. What was this?

The Peerless School warden sized up Ye Qingtang. She was extremely foreign and was not a Yang Lord from Peerless School, Phantom Valley, or Beiming Manor.

“Everyone, we are not yet done settling our matters today.”

Very quickly, the Peerless School warden swept a look across Perfected Xuanchen and the rest.

Perfected Xuanchen frowned deeply. He looked at the Yang Lord before him and said apologetically, “Yang Lord… We still have some matters to discuss. If you have time, how about staying in Falling Sky Valley for two days…”

Upon hearing that, Ye Qingtang sneered on the inside but maintained an indifferent expression. “Don’t bother with me. You all can just discuss your matters.”

Perfected Xuanchen nodded. After giving Yan Shu instructions, Perfected Xuanchen returned to the main hall with the Peerless School envoy.

Currently, Yan Shu was accompanying Ye Qingtang cautiously. This was also Yan Shu’s first time seeing and standing so close to a Yang Lord. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“You are Yan Shu.” Ye Qingtang’s eyes landed on Yan Shu as she commented softly.

“Yang Lord, I am indeed Yan Shu.” Yan Shu did not dare to look Ye Qingtang in the eye; thus, he lowered his head and replied respectfully.

“I am talking to you. Why are you not looking at me?” When Ye Qingtang saw the usually-serious Yan Shu’s current behavior, she could not help but laugh in her heart.

Upon hearing that, Yan Shu was startled and hurriedly looked up at Ye Qingtang.

Their eyes met. When Yan Shu looked at the almost-perfect face that was inches away from him, his heart skipped a beat. Not only was this Yang Lord young, but her appearance was also truly extraordinary like that of an otherworldly fairy.

“Bring me around the valley,” Ye Qingtang looked at Yan Shu and said.

“Noted…”

Yan Shu hurried walked at the front and brought Ye Qingtang around the valley.Sometime later, the two of them arrived at a training field and saw a few disciples exchanging blows.

Just as Ye Qingtang stopped in her tracks, she suddenly heard a loud rumble. A flashing shadow of a male shot towards her like an

arrow.

With sharp eyes and agile hands, Ye Qingtang immediately caught that figure.

Looking at the enraged male before her, Ye Qingtang recognized that this person was none other than her Master’s disciple, Ji Yixuan.

“Thank you, Junior Sister!”

Ji Yixuan was boiling with anger when he took a look at Ye Qingtang and actually did not recognize Ye Qingtang at once.

Although Ji Yixuan had seen Ye Qingtang’s female appearance before, a lot of time had passed since then.
