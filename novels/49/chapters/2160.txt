Chapter 2161: Awakened Bloodline (2)

After Ye Qingtang and her students left, Di Nuo ordered the rest of the people to continue their cultivation. It was only then that the gathered crowd finally dispersed.

“I already felt it was impossible that Jing Ze managed to beat Zhang Qiqiu so easily. So Jing Ze himself actually suffered internal injuries.” Some of the teenagers were still discussing the earlier fight.

“What do you mean?”

“You still don’t understand? Who doesn’t know about Jing Ze’s weak powers? But he managed to beat Zhang Qiqiu. I found it very strange until we saw that Jing Ze suddenly fainted. His body was covered in red light. Isn’t that red light the same as Zhang Qiqiu’s bloodline aura?”

The teenagers continued to discuss.

They thought that Jing Ze’s powers had increased but then realized that he had suffered serious internal injuries himself. This cleared up quite a bit of their initial shock.

As the crowd continued to discuss, Lei Yan and Nangong Lie stood by the side, quietly listening.

The two of them had a completely different line of thinking from the crowd.

Seeing that no one was watching, Lei Yan slipped out from the practice arena. But he ended up bumping into Nangong Lie the moment he left the martial arts faculty.

“Are you going to find Teacher Ye?” Nangong Lie grinned at the dark-faced Lei Yan.

The corners of Lei Yan’s lips twitched slightly. But Nangong Lie continued grinning. “Brother, relax. I was thinking the same thing as you. Let’s go together.”

Everyone else believed that Jing Ze’s victory was a fluke. He had suffered serious injuries himself and it was just sheer luck that he managed to land one punch on Zhang Qiqiu. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

But Lei Yan and Nangong Lie were well aware that if Jing Ze’s abilities had not increased at all, even if Zhang Qiqiu just stood there and let Jing Ze hit him, there was no way Jing Ze could have sent him flying.

Jing Ze’s powers had definitely improved.

Lei Yan and Nangong Lie’s powers were considered sub-par within the Netherworld Academy. They had previously disregarded Ye Qing, believing that the academy had hired him just to make fools out of them.

But...

After today’s incident, they no longer had the same opinion. If even Jing Ze could improve over such a short period of time, wouldn’t they have the same opportunity?

The two of them knew that the academy was already prepared to kick them out. Teacher Ye’s appearance might be an opportunity for them.

Separately, both of them arrived at the same conclusion. Having reached an implicit understanding of each other, the two guys headed toward Ye Qingtang’s classroom together.

Meanwhile, Ye Qingtang and her two students had already arrived back at the classroom.

Jing Ze’s temperature was still rising and sweat poured out of his body. His clothes were already completely soaked.

Mu Ziying stood by the side, her face pale as she clutched her own puppet tightly. Although she had remained silent the whole time, she was looking at Jing Ze with eyes filled with guilt.

“Teacher Ye, it’s all my fault... if not for me, Senior Brother Jing Ze would never...” Mu Ziying’s voice became softer and softer, her guilt nearly engulfing her little soul.

“Teacher Ye... did Senior Brother Jing Ze suffer some internal injuries?”

Ye Qingtang did not immediately reply to Mu Ziying. She was carefully analyzing Jing Ze’s condition.

Initially she had thought that Jing Ze had suffered some internal injuries. and was surprised. This was because she did not detect any signs of Zhang Qiqiu having caused serious damage to Jing Ze.

But Ye Qingtang was stunned after analyzing Jing Ze’s body.

Jing Ze was not injured at all.

On the contrary...

His bloodline was awakening!!

Ye Qingtang had Jing Ze practice bloodline activation techniques over this period. In today’s fight, Zhang Qiqiu had attacked with the power of his bloodline and somehow it had accelerated the awakening of Jing Ze’s bloodline.
