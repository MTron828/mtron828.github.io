Chapter 1282: Do Me A Favor? (2)

“Another smelly grub.” Ming Gu looked at Duan Xirui and narrowed his eyes impatiently.

Duan Xirui did not know who these Undead were, but he could not ignore the matter because of his dealings with the Long Family.

“Senior Duan, you must save me.” Long Yang pleaded as if he had met his savior.

Duan Xirui frowned slightly. The truth was that he was not familiar with Long Yang. However, he knew that Long Yang was a member of the Long Family, so he could not ignore the situation.

“If they have offended you in any way, I, Duan Xirui will apologize on their behalf. Please don’t kill them.” Duan Xirui cupped his fists and said.

Ming Gu just looked impatient. “Despicable smelly worm. Who are you to ask Ah Yao for a favor? Who do you think you are?”

Duan Xirui was famous in Central Mainland and had never been so insulted. His expression turned rather ugly, and he was about to say something.

The Undead who had been rescued shouted. “Human, how dare you be rude to our Holy Lord!”

Holy Lord?!

Duan Xirui was taken aback when he heard this.

The only one in the Undead Clan who could be addressed as Holy Lord was the Holy Lord of Shadows, who had vanished thousands of years ago.

Besides her, no one dared to take on this title.

Duan Xirui subconsciously glanced at the young girl, who had a faint smile. Shock appeared in his eyes.

Rumors had it that the Holy Lord of Shadows had disappeared for thousands of years…

“Despicable smelly grub, who gave you permission to look at Ah Yao with your filthy eyes!” When Ming Gu saw that Duan Xirui dared to stare at Ye Qingtang, a murderous aura filled his eyes. He suddenly raised his hand, and a black wind blasted at Duan Xirui.

Duan Xirui was fairly confident of his powers, but he was unable to avoid the blast of wind.

There was a loud bang! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Ming Gu’s blow sent Duan Xirui flying. He crashed heavily into a nearby boulder, and blood suddenly spurted from his mouth.

Duan Xirui, who had been thrown to the ground, was in agony. His level of cultivation gave him full confidence in his abilities. However, he had not expected this youthful-looking Undead to severely injure him with just one blow.

He could not possibly defend himself against this kind of ability.

Duan Xirui suddenly thought of how the Undead had addressed the young girl.

Holy Lord…

Could this young girl be the Holy Lord of Shadows?!

Just the thought of it caused Duan Xirui to break out in a cold sweat.

How bold was he to ask for a favor from the Holy Lord of Shadows?

Who was he to the Holy Lord of Shadows!

“I have offended you. Please, Holy Lord of Shadows, forgive me.” When he saw how terrible Ming Gu’s powers were, Duan Xirui guessed the identity of the young girl who was standing next to Ming Gu. At that point, he did not dare to put on any airs. He even ignored the agonizing pain in his body and kneeled down frantically. His tall frame could not help but shiver.

At that moment, Duan Xirui wished he could chop that stupid Long Yang into a thousand pieces.

What has Long Yang eaten to make him so ridiculously audacious?

He even dared to provoke the Holy Lord of the Temple of Shadows!

Ye Qingtang had quite a good impression of Duan Xirui from her previous life and did not intend to make things difficult for him. She just said blandly, “Do you wish to defend them?”
