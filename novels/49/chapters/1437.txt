Ye You was the daughter of Jiang Qin’s twin sister; thus, Jiang Qin treated her as her own daughter.

If Ye Qingtang wanted to find a backing, her notorious “parents” had to return to the Jiang Family and attach importance to their “daughter”, which was her.

Otherwise, she would still lose out to Ye You.

Elder Xu and Jiang Liu gave Ye Qingtang a few instructions and took their leave. Ye Qingtang returned to her room to rest as well. She was more pressed to cultivate after realizing her gap with Jiang Qin and began to cultivate immediately without resting. Only by consolidating her current cultivation realm quickly would she be able to safely enter the world of constellations in the Illusory Void once again.

Ye Qingtang was still cultivating the next morning when she heard a deafening knocking sound on her door along with Beidou Demon Lord’s voice.

“Little sister, are you awake?”

Ye Qingtang stopped her cultivation when she heard Beidou Demon Lord’s voice. When she opened the door, she saw a beaming Beidou Demon Lord carrying a pile of fruit.

“The Jiang Family sent me quite a lot of food just now. I saw that these fruits are not bad. Let’s eat them together.” After sharing his frozen banana with her, Beidou Demon Lord was very willing to share any good items with his new sworn sister.

Looking at Beidou Demon Lord’s huge frame, Ye Qingtang’s whole night of fatigue seemed to disappear completely in a moment.

A human and an ape sat outside the courtyard and began digging in.

The Jiang Family had an extremely high status in the Central Mainland, and all of the fruits that they gave Beidou Demon Lord were rare, quality items. While Beidou Demon Lord had a tall and sturdy frame, he was a complete foodie.

Otherwise, he would not travel all the way to the frozen areas just for a few bunches of frozen bananas.

Beidou Demon Lord was delighted by this pile of precious fruits. It should be known that he had only heard a few things about the items here and never truly tasted them before.

“I have never seen this dragon peach before. If my clan members knew I could eat the dragon peach, they would all be shocked.” Beidou Demon Lord had a face of excitement as he held a peach that was about the size of his palm.

Of course, he would not forget to share such a good item with Ye Qingtang. He selected an extremely nice-looking dragon peach and placed it in front of Ye Qingtang.

The corner of Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched slightly as she looked at the dragon peach that was even larger than her body.

This peach could last her for a year…

The little white tiger laid beside Ye Qingtang lazily. As it watched Beidou Demon Lord eat heartily, it nonchalantly played with its beard while its paw quietly tossed a peach into its mouth.

Just as the three of them were eating joyfully, a rather piercing voice suddenly traveled into their ears.

“Who is that damn person? How dare she wreck chaos in the Jiang Family?”

The person who spoke was a tall and good-looking youth who was followed by a few other similar-aged people, including Ye Xun!

“So you are Ye Qingtang?” After shooting a look of disgust at Beidou Demon Lord, the youth in the lead looked at Ye Qingtang condescendingly and sized her up without any respect.

“You are the uneducated and wild girl who bullied my younger sister You?”

Ye Qingtang cast a look at that youth without responding to him.

“I am talking to you. Are you deaf? I want you to apologize to You right now,” that youth said coldly.
