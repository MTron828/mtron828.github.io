1324 Had A Lot of Fun 2

He had already accused the Mo Family, but they still wanted to involve Ling Yan in the Mo Family scandal?

How awkward would that be?

“If we say that it’s infighting…” The Eldest Princess was desperate.

“Do you think that Ling Yan will be unable to think of that?” Ye Qingtang said patiently.

The Eldest Princess lost all ideas while the Eldest Prince and Second Princess were filled with frustration.

“It’s late. Elder Ye, you must be worn out already. Do head back to rest first. We will monitor the situation,” said the Eldest Prince.

Ye Qingtang, who was more than eager to stay away from these fools, immediately rose and left.

Lady Ghost followed silently.

“Holy Lord, it must be difficult for you to trouble yourself over the Eldest Prince’s matter,” Lady Ghost said softly.

“They’re seriously a group of fools.” Ye Qingtang responded plainly in the demeanor of a Holy Lord as a hint of annoyance emerged in her eyes.

Although Lady Ghost was not at the scene, she more or less knew what happened from the Eldest Prince’s recount and was rather impressed with Ling Yan’s intelligence.

“You’ve worked hard, Holy Lord. Do rest early.”

Ye Qingtang returned to her room without uttering a word.

Once Ye Qingtang left, a tiny figure appeared at the corner of the long corridor near them.

Lady Ghost immediately kneeled on a knee upon noticing that figure.

“Greetings, Holy Son Ming Wang.”

Ming Wang slowly walked out from the shadows though his eyes were fixated in the direction where Ye Qingtang left. His pitch dark orbs narrowed slightly, and no one could guess his current thoughts. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Unbeknown to Ming Gu and Ye Qingtang, Ming Wang headed here this morning.

“Holy Lord did not have any strange behavior on this trip.” Lady Ghost reported honestly. She had been observing Ye Qingtang’s actions silently on this trip and did not find anything suspicious. Even when Ye Qingtang was helping the Eldest Prince and the rest to come up with a plan, her intelligence did not raise any doubts to Lady Ghost.

Ming Wang narrowed his eyes, but his stern expression remained.

Lady Ghost’s words did not eliminate his suspicions.

Of course, Lady Ghost was also aware that if someone was set on impersonating the Holy Lord of Shadows, she would not easily give the game away.

Meanwhile, the moment Ye Qingtang returned to her room, she washed off the disguise on her face, changed her clothes, and laid on the bed.

Previously, she and Ling Yan were fighting on the same line, and Ling Yan always helped her to emerge safely out of danger. Ye Qingtang already knew that Ling Yan was wise back then, but she only realized how insane his level of intelligence was now that they were on opposing sides.

“He could actually predict today’s events a few years ago. This fellow can’t be a god, can he…” Ye Qingtang furrowed her brows, but it was evident that Ling Yan made preparations for the disaster relief a few years ago.

She had a recurring thought that Ling Yan had planned today’s incident a long time ago such that even accusing the Mo Family seemed to be part of his plan from the start.

“I keep feeling as though I’m being led by the nose.” Ye Qingtang sighed. Right now, she was extremely admirable of those who were enemies with Ling Yan—how courageous must they be to oppose such an intelligent rival…

At that instant, a sound suddenly came from Ye Qingtang’s voice transmission stone.

“Miss Ye.”

Ye Qingtang took the voice transmission stone out.

“I thought you threw the voice transmission stone away.” Ye Qingtang mumbled. She wanted to contact Ling Yan these few days and notify him of the Eldest Prince’s plans, but there was completely no response from the voice transmission stone.

Ling Yan chuckled. “How would I bear to throw the voice transmission stone if I know that you will use it to contact me? Don’t worry, Miss Ye, I’ve been keeping the voice transmission stone carefully.”
