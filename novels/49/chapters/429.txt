Wasn’t this girl a reserve disciple from Xuanling Sect?

Normally, reserve disciples were only to fill the numbers and rarely took part in the actual competition.

“You wish to have a match?” The Qinglin Sect elder was slightly taken aback. He had never heard of a reserve disciple requesting to enter the ring although they did have the right to participate as well.

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

Then, that Qinglin Sect elder looked at the few Xuanling Sect elders.

While reserve disciples did have the right to take part, the permission of the sect’s elders was still required.

“What is Ye Qingtang doing?”

“As a substitute disciple, she still wants to go up and fight with Fu Lingtian?!”

“Is she talking big to impress people?”

Some Xuanling Sect disciples who came along in this trip sneered.

“Step back, Ye Qingtang.” There were no emotions on Elder Mo’s face while his voice was cold and detached. When Ye Qingtang requested to participate the first time, he had already rejected her request with his silence, yet unexpectedly, she actually mentioned it again.

The Three Sect Competition had already ended, and there was no need to continue on.

“As a reserve disciple, I wish to enter the ring and learn from Senior Brother Fu.” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“There’s no need to.” Elder Mo replied indifferently.

Xuanling Sect placed last once again this year, and their morale was already at rock bottom. Why would they still allow Ye Qingtang to play around?

“Master, since we cannot win the competition, if I can learn something from sparring with Senior Brother Fu, it will be useful as well.” Seeing that Elder Mo was disapproving of her request, Ye Qingtang changed her argument immediately.

With that said, realization suddenly dawned on the disciples from all three sects.

Fu Lingtian’s attainments in martial skills were extremely high, and they would definitely be able to learn a thing or two by sparring with him.

“Haha. I’ve never thought that this reserve disciple from Xuanling Sect would not be willing to let go of any chance to improve.”

A few Wind Moon Sect elders commented as they laughed.

“Elder Mo, since Ye Qingtang has the mind to learn, just let her go then. If she really learns something, this trip would not be wasted.” Elder Qin persuaded after seeing Ye Qingtang’s stubbornness.

After hearing it, Elder Mo was silent for a moment and finally relented. “Since that is so, go ahead then. Take note of the way and angle that Fu Lingtian attacks with. It would be great if you can improve from this.”

“Thank you, Master!”

After gaining Elder Mo’s approval, Ye Qingtang immediately entered the competition court.

“Senior Brother Fu, Junior Sister Ye Qingtang is honored to learn from you.” Ye Qingtang smiled at Fu Lingtian and cupped fists her fists together.

Fu Lingtian took a glimpse at Ye Qingtang. He obviously heard what Ye Qingtang said previously. “Junior Sister Ye, since you wish to learn something from me, I will grant you five moves.”

All the disciples from the three sects were surprised to hear this.

Fu Lingtian was actually granting Ye Qingtang five moves?

What was the concept of five moves? When formidable people sparred, their lives and deaths could be determined in seconds, and even half a move was enough for a decisive outcome, much less five moves.

“Senior Brother Fu is so generous…”

“Five moves… If he granted Feng Yiran five moves, the first place for this competition would definitely be Wind Moon Sect’s…”

“Haha, that is definite. However, the opponent is only a substitute disciple from Xuanling Sect. Granting five moves is not anything, and it displays the generosity of Senior Brother Fu instead.”

“That Xuanling Sect disciple’s luck is indeed good. She has a chance of five moves and can learn even more from Senior Brother Fu Lingtian…”

However, a smile passed by Ye Qingtang’s eyes as she looked at Fu Lingtian. She shook her head and said, “Senior Brother Fu, you are the defending champion of the Three Sect Competition while I’m only a disciple at the bottom of the Xuanling Sect team. Granting me five moves is too petty already.”
