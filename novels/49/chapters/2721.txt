Chapter 2722: Five Great Relics (3)

Ye Qingtang still remembered that Tian promised to grant her a wish, including becoming a Perfected Immortal. However, Ye Qingtang did not take it seriously and casually asked Tian to send her out of the cursed hell. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Fortunately, Ye Qingtang didn’t ask to become a Perfected Immortal. Even if she really became a Perfected Immortal then, she would still remain trapped in the cursed hell. In the end, she would have died in that land of despair.

Back then she had forgone a chance to become an immortal, and now, another opportunity had come.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang looked at the Destruction-level divine weapon in her hand which she bought with 100,000 points. She felt mixed emotions. She had really exceeded her own expectations.

“What do you think? Have you thought it through… If I were you, I would definitely choose the Perfected Immortal Relic and the Imperishable Relic. I would first swallow the Perfected Immortal Relic and become an immortal. After that, I would swallow the Imperishable Relic and become indestructible…” the skeleton said.

“You make it sound so powerful. Why didn’t the Heaven Ascension Sect Master use these relics back then?” One of the disciples asked.

The skeleton glanced at the disciple. “If the Heaven Ascension Sect Master didn’t die, do you think these five relics would come into existence?”

The Great Immortal Temple disciple, “…”

Actually, Ye Qingtang was very tempted by the skeleton’s suggestion. However, no matter how tempted he was, she did not have enough cursed points.

Currently, Ye Qingtang only had enough cursed points to buy the two cheapest relics.

After careful consideration, Ye Qingtang decided to purchase the Paragon Relic. Firstly, she was not too interested in the Yin Yang Relic and secondly, the Great Immortal Temple treated her very well. Therefore, the Paragon Relic would be a favor to the Great Immortal Temple.

With her remaining cursed points, she could use them to purchase the Space-Time Relic. This way, she could return to her own era…

“The Space-Time Relic and the Paragon Relic,” Ye Qingtang said after a long time.

The disciples of the Great Immortal Temple all looked at Ye Qingtang.

No one expected Ye Qingtang to really choose the Paragon Relic. If it were them, they might not choose the Paragon Relic under such enticement.

“Junior Sister Ye Yue, what do you want a Space-Time Relic for?” Lan Shan was somewhat curious.

“I have a use for it,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Don’t tell me you plan to use the Space-Time Relic to go to the past or the future… That is too ridiculous. And you can only use it once. Junior Sister Ye Yue, don’t be too impulsive…”

Ye Qingtang, “…”

Indeed she wanted to use the Space-Time Relic to return to her era. This era was not her rightful period.

After deducting her cursed points, the skeleton handed the Paragon Relic and Space-Time Relic to Ye Qingtang.

“The ultimate legacies of the Heaven Ascension Sect Master have been inherited, and I have achieved success.”

The skeleton sighed and dissipated.

The skeleton wasn’t the only one. The entire high-tier ancient city disappeared without a trace.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang and the rest were standing in a valley where the high-tier ancient city used to be.

However, the ancient city had disappeared.

“After the core legacies were bought, everything about the Heaven Ascension Sect Master disappeared…” Lan Shan pondered.

“In that case, there are seven other legacy places in this realm. I wonder who would be so lucky.”

“The Heaven Ascension legacy has been inherited… the Silver Star legacy has been inherited.”

An ethereal voice suddenly echoed in the depths of everyone’s minds.

“Let’s go.”

Before Ye Qingtang could return to her senses, Ling Yan suddenly appeared from the void and grabbed her.
