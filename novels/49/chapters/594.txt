“Where is the Yuehua Sect Master now?” Ye Qingtang felt that something was odd. The two people that died outside the palace were the Yuehua Sect Elder and disciple. Why would the Yuehua Sect Master murder them?

“They are in the second palace!” The young man pointed forward and explained.

The second palace was separated by a door.

The Yuehua Sect Master entered the mysterious palace first as he thought that there were destinies inside. After checking through the place and realizing that there was no treasure inside, he then led his sect disciples into the second palace.

However, just when they entered, the Yuehua Sect Master suddenly chopped off the Great Elder’s head and the top half of the body of one of the female disciples.

The rest were shocked after seeing this. They totally did not understand why the Yuehua Sect Master would suddenly be murderous. They had to close the door to the second palace to prevent him from killing others outside.

“Open… open the door!”

“Let us out, bastard… Open the door now!”

“Arh!!!”

Screams came out of the second palace. People outside could even hear the banging sound on the silver door as those inside were trying to return to the first palace. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Ye Qingtang was slightly astonished.

Apparently, besides the Yuehua Sect Master who was trapped inside the second palace, there were others who did not escape on time.

“Humph!”

One of the Yunxiao Sect elders scorned. “We will get into trouble as well if we open the door. How ridiculous it is!”

Everyone chose to remain silent though the screams and the banging sounds that were coming out constantly. No one dared to help them.

Their abilities could not be compared with the Yuehua Sect Master’s. If they opened the door, they would suffer as well.

Ye Qingtang thought for a while and then walked forward directly. It seemed that she wanted to open the door.

Everyone was stunned after seeing this. The Yunxiao Sect elder took a leap and landed in front of Ye Qingtang. He shouted angrily. “What do you want!”

Ye Qingtang took a glimpse at the Yunxiao Sect elder and said coldly, “Of course, I’m trying to save people.

“Save people? If you want to die, I will not stop you. However, I will not let you open the door. The Yuehua Sect Master is crazy now. If he comes out, we will all die as a result of your action.” The Yunxiao Sect elder sneered.

“Guys, there was a demonic monster guarding the palace outside. No one can leave this place alive. Though the door here is made of cold iron, based on the Yuehua Sect Master’s ability, you think the door can trap him?” Ye Qingtang did not bother to reply the Yunxiao Sect elder. She looked at the rest in the palace and explained.

“Once the Yuehua Sect Master kills everyone inside the second palace, he will definitely break through the door… If I open the door now and save one person, we will have another ally. If we fail to save one person, we lose one ally… There are ten of us here, so why are we still afraid of the Yuehua Sect Master alone? However, if he kills everyone inside, we will be the ones who lose.” Ye Qingtang continued to explain as she saw the silence in the palace.

Ye Qingtang’s words made everyone think deeply.

They had seen too many friends die in front of their eyes since they entered the Hell of Avicinaraka. They were only a step away from death in every danger they encountered. Even now, no one dared to promise that they could leave this place alone.
