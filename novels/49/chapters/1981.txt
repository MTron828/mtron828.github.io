Chapter 1982: Double-edged Sword (1)

Ye Qingtang went to look for Ling Yan right after returning from the Frost Abyss. The two tribe leaders noticed her actions and exchanged complicated glances.

Even though...

Holy Lord had finally been enlightened, but... Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Surely it’s not the time now, right?

Holy Lord, it isn’t time for you to indulge in such temptation when the Ancient You Clan is eying everything.

The two tribe leaders were feeling complicated inside, but none of them dared to say anything about it.

Other than that doltish teenager, Ling Yan was the only normal person who entered the Holy Lord’s room. It was normal for them to be curious.

“Ling Yan, I went to look for Crimson League’s ambassador in the Central Mainland just as you said. Do you really think it’ll work?” Ye Qingtang had acted according to Ling Yan’s plans and revealed the news to the Crimson League.

Ye Qingtang understood the rationale behind his plans, but she was afraid that the Crimson League would not be easily fooled and it would not be easy to sow discord between them.

“Miss Ye, to know whether it’ll work, you’ll just have to wait and see.” Ling Yan smiled.

“Don’t just leave me hanging here! What exactly are you planning to do?” Ye Qingtang could somehow sense that Ling Yan was going to do something, but she wasn’t certain yet.

“It’s not important whether the Crimson League believes you or not. We just need to sow doubt in them and they will send someone to investigate it. Moreover, I believe that the Crimson League is aware that the Ancient You Clan’s powers have been increasing. They are not bothered by it because they think that it has nothing to do with them and will not threaten their interests since the Ancient You Clan is based in the First Domain.

“It won’t be easy if you want the Crimson League to be completely convinced that the Ancient You Clan is eying them.” Ye Qingtang was aware that Ling Yan’s plan was a good one, but it wouldn’t be easy to make use of the Crimson League.

“Miss Ye, don’t worry. The guests from the Crimson League will come to the Temple of Shadows in just a few days. That will be the beginning of our plan.” Ling Yan smiled.

If anything, Ye Qingtang was left completely confused by Ling Yan’s ambiguous answer. Smart people would plan a few steps, but Ling Yan would plan even more steps ahead.

Ye Qingtang could somehow guess what he was going to do next, but she couldn’t catch anything further ahead.

“How do you know that the Crimson League is going to send someone to the Temple of Shadows?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“The Crimson League would definitely investigate it since you personally told them about it. If you spoke the truth, they would surely do something about it. Conversely, if it’s untrue, the Crimson League would deal with the Temple of Shadows,” Ling Yan explained.

Ye Qingtang, “...”

“You’re saying that... if there’s no way to convince the Crimson League that the Ancient You Clan is planning something against them, the Crimson League is going to ruin the Temple of Shadows instead?” Ye Qingtang’s eyes narrowed as she asked Ling Yan.

Ling Yan nodded.

Strong alliances would never allow such accusations. They had to protect their image and reputation. They would never allow anyone to cross the lines.

The corners of Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched. She really wanted to slap Ling Yan when she saw him grinning. They were supposed to kill with a borrowed knife, but this knife had become a double-edged sword instead.

If they were exposed, the Temple of Shadows would suffer even more dire consequences than the Ancient You Clan for sure.
