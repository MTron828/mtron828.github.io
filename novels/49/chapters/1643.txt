Chapter 1644: Forced To Concede (3)

People were often like that. When they did not do well, they could not bear to see things go smoothly for someone else.

Especially if it was someone that they felt was inferior to them; that made it even more difficult for them to accept.

Ye Qingtang ignored their sarcastic remarks. She paid no more attention to them than she would to a fly buzzing in her ear.

But the youths were even more enraged when Ye Qingtang ignored them. Their expressions were malicious as they blocked her way.

“Ye Qingtang, you’re pretty hardworking. Did you just leave the practice arena? Ah.... with your standards, even if you managed to crawl into the Martial Arts Championship, you will be defeated in the first round. You better put in some last-minute work. But... isn’t it too late to pretend to be diligent now?”

“Get lost.” Ye Qingtang glared coldly at the youths who were blocking her way.

“Oh, hot-tempered, are we? Do you really think you’re better than us just because you managed to enter the Martial Arts Championship by dumb luck? If you want my opinion, the smart thing to do is to trot over to the elders and remove yourself from the quota. Otherwise, no matter how lucky you are, anyone will smash you to smithereens once you’re in the Martial Arts Championship arena. When that happens, you better not cry in the arena and embarrass the Jiang Family.” A few youths spoke maliciously. They were unable to take this lying down, and their deepest desire now was to fling the most vicious words they could find at this young girl.

Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes. However, before she could make any move, a petite figure slowly approached in the moonlight.

“If you dare to make trouble for my Elder Sister Qing, I will leave you crying here right now.” A slightly amused voice reached their ears.

Ye Qingtang turned towards the voice. At some point, Jiang Shaobai had appeared on the road ahead. Her lips were smiling, and her shining eyes were crinkled in amusement. She looked straight at the youths who were blocking the way.

The moment the aggressive youths saw Jiang Shaobai, their expressions changed. They could not help but look somewhat panicked.

Jiang Shaobai walked over to Ye Qingtang slowly and smilingly took her small hand. Then, she looked up at the pitch-black sky and slowly said, “It’s a dark and windy night...”

Then, she moved his gaze downward a little and looked at the youths. “Isn’t there a saying that a dark and windy night is a good night for killing someone? I think it refers to a night like this, right?” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The youths instantly felt a chill spreading through their body. All of them gulped involuntarily.

Damn it, how could they have forgotten this fellow?

They had often seen Jiang Shaobai and Ye Qingtang together. Jiang Shaobai had been absent for a few months, and they had completely forgotten about this killing monster.

“Ah... Shaobai, we have something to do. We’d better go.” A few of the youths saw that matters were not going well and decided to get away as soon as possible.

Jiang Shaobai raised a single hand and blocked their way.

“You bothered my Elder Sister Qing for so long. Where do you think you’re going without an apology?”

The youths turned pale. They glanced at Jiang Shaobai and Ye Qingtang. After some deliberation, they forced themselves to say to Ye Qingtang;

“Sorry, we’ve drunk too much today and spoke amiss. Ye Qingtang, please don’t take it to heart.”

“Alcohol is bad for you. You should be more careful. It would be a pity if you drank yourself to death,” Jiang Shaobai said with a smile.
