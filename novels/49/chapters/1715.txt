Chapter 1716: The Undead (2)

A giant white skeleton suddenly shook off the snow and stood up. It was nearly three meters tall.

Ye Qingtang instinctively wanted to flee away. But before she could take more than a few steps, the giant skeleton reached out and grabbed her.

“Where did this little girl come from?” The giant skeleton brought Ye Qingtang in for a closer look. Its pitch-black eyes were like two endless abysses staring right into Ye Qingtang.

Reaching out, Ye Qingtang tried her best to force apart the fingers of the skeleton. But no matter how much strength she exerted, they remained stiff and unyielding. She attacked it with black flames but the giant skeleton seemed completely unaffected. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Roar!” The giant skeleton suddenly gave an earth-shattering howl.

A tremendously powerful force was suddenly barrelling straight at Ye Qingtang.

Paragon level!!

Ye Qingtang was shaken to the core by that powerful force. Panic filled her eyes as she gazed at this giant skeleton who could release a Paragon-level force as and when it pleased.

“Old man, enough already. We have to get along with each other in future. Why are you scaring her now?” One of the skeletons shook his head sagely as he watched the captive Ye Qingtang.

“It’s been a long time since I have touched such soft flesh. Ahh, so nostalgic.” The giant skeleton seemed to like Ye Qingtang very much. He couldn’t resist tightening his grip fondly.

But to Ye Qingtang, that slight movement felt like she was being crushed to death!

The two skeletons sighed when they saw the giant skeletons doting manner.

“Come on, we have to head back now. You heard the roar of the Ice King just now. We can’t be sure it won’t come this way. You’ll be swallowed whole if we encounter it.”

The giant skeleton shivered at their warning. It immediately hurried after those two skeletons, with Ye Qingtang still clutched firmly in its bony hand.

Carried by the giant skeleton the entire way, Ye Qingtang was jolted in all directions and exposed to the harsh winds. She felt like she was about to fall apart.

They soon arrived at the deep end of a canyon where a large group of skeletons gathered.

The giant skeleton carried Ye Qingtang like a new toy. It had no intention of letting her go. Those other skeletons didn’t express any surprise on seeing Ye Qingtang in his hand.

“Old man, put her down. She will be crushed to death within a day if you continue to hold her like that,” One of the skeletons admonished him.

“She won’t die here. Even if I crush her to a pulp, she will continue to live,” the giant skeleton grumbled a bit but in the end, he placed Ye Qingtang down on the ground.

Regaining her freedom, Ye Qingtang cautiously surveyed the skeletons around her.

“You are all... humans?” Ye Qingtang hesitated a moment before asking. She could clearly feel that these skeletons possessed the vibe of living humans.

“Ha... this little girl is quite smart. We were once human, that’s right. But in our current state, we are more like the undead now.” One of the skeletons chuckled out loud. His jaw clattered so much that it looked like it was going to fall off anytime. It was somewhat disturbing...

“You don’t need to be so mystified. You will soon become like us. Treasure your skin and flesh as long as you can.”

“What?” Ye Qingtang was startled.
