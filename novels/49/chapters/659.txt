Chapter 660: Who Are You (2)

Venerable Wu’s lips curled up slightly. A faint smile emerged on his face as he looked at Ye Qingtang. “Actually, I forcefully advanced to Yin Yang Perfected Lord from the peak of the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three, which caused mental demons. I don’t have much time left. However, I am very gratified to witness your growth in my last moments. Qingtang, you are Xuanling Sect’s pride…”

He shook his head and continued. “I really miss the times we refined weapons in Xuanling Sect…”

As Venerable Wu finished his sentence, he turned into a ball of bloody fog and instantly surged into the Ice Frost Divine Sword in Ye Qingtang’s hands.

“Grand Elder…”

Ye Qingtang’s brows were slightly furrowed. Venerable Wu forcefully advanced his cultivation state, which damaged his veins. He already had serious internal injuries, and after being wounded by the Ice Frost Divine Sword through their battle, nothing could be done to save him.

Boom!

Without giving time for Ye Qingtang to think further, the palace suddenly shook.

“F*ck. The Ice Frost Divine Sword deviated from its initial location. The third level is about to collapse!” the little white tiger said hurriedly.

After hearing that, Ye Qingtang immediately grabbed the little white tiger and fled away from the palace.

Seeing Ye Qingtang from afar, the Blood Moon Elder rushed forward hurriedly.

“Holy Lady, what happened?” The Blood Moon Elder scanned Ye Qingtang and asked.

“Leave this place first.”

Ye Qingtang could not be bothered to say any useless crap to the Blood Moon Elder. Since she had already obtained the Ice Frost Divine Sword, the Dimension Wall would not be broken, and the pressing matter was to leave the third level first.

Very quickly, the Blood Moon Elder followed Ye Qingtang and returned to the first level.

It was a boundless zone of ice.

Currently, the number of surviving cultivators in the first level was already less than one-third of the original number.

“Ye Qingtang, you’re indeed a huge wild card.”

When they reached the first level, they saw a Buddha statue moving with a young male on its shoulder.

The good-looking male was dressed in white, and his eyes landed right on Ye Qingtang.

“Ning Luo?”

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly as she looked at the male standing on the Buddha statue.

What exactly was Ning Luo’s identity for him to be able to control the fierce creatures in the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm…

The demonized Buddha statue in front of them was extremely powerful, and one could not tell its exact level of skills. Its aura was even more terrifying than that of the previous Buddha statue in the blood-colored city.

“Ye Qingtang, perhaps I was too kind then…” Ning Luo shook his head. “This matter has nothing to do with you originally, but you had to intervene in it.”

“Ning Luo, who are you? What do you want?” Ye Qingtang asked with a calm expression.

“What do I want?” Ning Luo scoffed. “Naturally, it is to kill all of the sinners on this mainland.”

“Who exactly are you?” Ye Qingtang was rather confused. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Who I am is not important.” Ning Luo shook his head, seeming to be unwilling to resolve Ye Qingtang’s confusion.

According to what Venerable Wu said, Ning Luo was not a descendant of a follower, yet why…

“Return the sword to me.” Ning Luo did not answer Ye Qingtang’s question and instead looked at the Ice Frost Divine Sword in her hands.

“Ha.” Ye Qingtang sneered coldly. “This sword is mine. Why should I give it to you?”

“This sword is yours?” Ning Luo’s face was emotionless as he stared at Ye Qingtang. “Why haven’t I heard about that?”

Before Ye Qingtang could say anything else, the Ice Frost Divine Sword flew out of her hands instantly.

When Ye Qingtang returned to her senses, the Ice Frost Divine Sword was already in Ning Luo’s hands.
