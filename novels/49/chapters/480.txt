Chapter 481: The Paragon Skill (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ning Luo was at Martial Qi Level Three, yet Ye Qingtang could be evenly matched with him…

No, it was not a tied match either. The situation before them was clearly Ye Qingtang suppressing Ning Luo.

“Twisted…” Qin Huan’s eyes were widened.

Regardless of whether it was Ye Qingtang or Ning Luo, both of them displayed a frightening combat ability which had exceedingly surpassed that of the inner sect disciples, even to the point that Qin Huan could not see the tracks of Ye Qingtang’s and Ning Luo’s attacks clearly…

Boom!

A loud explosion caused the Xuanling Sect disciples to return to their senses.

At that instant, Ning Luo had already drawn out his sword, which clashed with Ye Qingtang’s Demonic Blood Sword.

The sword aura swept across the surroundings instantly.

The expressions of the Xuanling Sect disciples changed, and they immediately retreated backward.

The amount of power from the battle between Ye Qingtang and Ning Luo was not a joke, and they could be chopped into pieces if they were just a little careless.

If they innocently embroiled in this disaster, there was no one they could find to reason when they died without a trace.

“Haha… Ye Qingtang, you’re really not an ordinary person. You’re only at the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two but could force me to draw my sword out. You’re truly not simple…”

Ning Luo laughed as he looked at Ye Qingtang.

However, Ning Luo had not finished his sentence yet when Ye Qingtang’s left fist was fiercely thrown on Ning Luo’s face.

Boom!

Then, Ning Luo’s face was a little twisted, and he was flung several meters away from Ye Qingtang’s punch.

“You…” After steadying himself, Ning Luo wiped the blood from the corners of his lips as haze clouded his eyes.

“You? So full of b*llsh*t.” Ye Qingtang sneered coldly.

“Haha…” Ning Luo guffawed suddenly. “Forget it… I originally wanted to play with you, but since you don’t know how to appreciate my kindness, there is no need for me to be merciful already.”

“Really? Show me your best then.” Ye Qingtang uttered.

Since Ye Qingtang had already confirmed that Ning Luo was a Yunxiao Sect disciple, she made up her mind to kill him right there and not allow him to flee back to Yunxiao. Otherwise… even she would not be able to stop history from repeating itself.

“You’re so confident, Ye Qingtang. Could it be that you thought I’ve already done my best?” Ning Luo asked.

“A bunch of nonsense!” Ye Qingtang shouted coldly. Then, she leaped up and slashed the Demonic Blood Sword down at Ning Luo, wanting to split Ning Luo into two.

At that instant, Ning Luo was motionless in face of Ye Qingtang’s mighty aura as he snickered. “You’re a mere red spirit root, and there’s no way you can understand the Paragon Skill… Just this fact itself has already sentenced you to death.”

As he spoke, his aura changed drastically.

In the dense forest, the surrounding temperature dropped, and there seemed to even be snowflakes descending slowly.

“The Paragon Skill?!”

Zhu Changge, Qin Huan, and the other Xuanling Sect disciples who were hidden far away could not help but quiver in the extremely cold temperature. A hint of terror emerged in their eyes at that moment.

Although it was said that there was a chance of understanding the Paragon Skill from yellow spirit roots onward, many cultivators were nowhere close to understanding it even after an entire lifetime. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Not mentioning cultivators with yellow spirit roots, even those with green spirit roots might not be able to understand the Paragon Skill throughout their lives.

For example, while Xuanling Sect had disciples with green spirit roots, Feng Moli was the only one who understood the Paragon Skill!

As the group panicked, frost formed all over the ground.
