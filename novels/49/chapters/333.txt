Ye Qingtang smiled. Turning around, she saw a dressing table in her bedroom and said, “Fei Ying, move this dressing table into Ni Shang’s room.”

Ye Qingtang’s words stunned both Fei Ying and Ni Shang.

“Miss, how… how can you do this?” Ni Shang could not help but panic.

Ye Qingtang chuckled. “Why not? I won’t use it anyway. Furthermore, I intend to add a couch here. If this dressing table is here, the couch would not fit.”

“You want to add a couch in the bedroom?” Ni Shang was confused and fell into a trance when she saw Ye Qingtang’s extreme beauty. Indeed… with such looks, why would she still need any makeup?

Ye Qingtang nodded. “I still have a silver wolf which will be sent here soon. It usually sleeps in the same room as me. Moving the couch in would be convenient for it to rest.”

When they entered the inner sect, all spirit pets were required to be transported by specialized people. Ye Qingtang wanted to bring the silver wolf over herself but could only head here alone first due to the sect’s rules.

Recalling how she was too busy with the assessment and neglected the silver wolf in this period of time, Ye Qingtang was worried that it would blame her.

“Silver wolf…” Ni Shang’s face turned blank. She knew that quite a number of disciples would raise spirit pets, and there was an area to keep the spirit pets in the inner sect disciples’ courtyard. However… it was her first time hearing of… bringing the spirit pet into the room to sleep together with it like Ye Qingtang.

Ni Shang was extremely surprised, and on the other hand, perhaps it was because Fei Ying was a boy, his eyes could not stop twinkling when he heard the words ‘silver wolf.’

As they talked, a few handymen from the sect pushed a metal cage into the yard.

“Miss, your spirit pet is transported,” a handyman notified.

Ye Qingtang broke out in smiles at that and walked out with Ni Shang and Fei Ying following right after.

A huge wolf with a reflective silver shine all over its body was standing in a wide metal cage.

If Mu Su were there then and saw his master being transported to Ye Qingtang in a cage, he might just break down immediately.

Fei Ying’s eyes almost popped out after seeing that silver wolf. “I’ve never seen such a huge silver wolf.” Before he became a sword boy, he helped out in the Spirit Pet Hall for a period of time. There were different types of spirit pets in the Spirit Pet Hall, and the number of wolf breeds was not small. However… none of them could be compared to the silver wolf before him.

Ye Qingtang opened the metal cage, and the silver wolf walked out calmly without any orders from Ye Qingtang throughout.

This scene fell into the eyes of the handymen who transported the silver wolf over, and they found it rather magical. When they were transporting the silver wolf, they thought it was merely an ordinary wolf and even brought instruments to prevent the silver wolf from struggling since its owner was not by its side. Yet, who knew…

The silver wolf was exceptionally calm and did not require to be scolded by anyone. Throughout the transportation journey, it was quiet and did not struggle at all.

“Miss, please take a look. If you’ve confirmed that there’s nothing wrong, we will take our leave first?” The handyman looked at the silver wolf which had an extraordinary bearing. They had transported many spirit pets on usual days, but such a fierce wolf was a first.

Lowering her body, Ye Qingtang ruffled the silver wolf’s shiny fur with a smile and replied. “Everything is fine. Thank you for the trouble.”
