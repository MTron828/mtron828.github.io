A fierce burst of flames exploded around Ye Qingtang. The black flames roared as she forced herself to withstand Jiang Qin’s blow. However, blood seeped from the corner of her mouth.

Mo Y was fighting fiercely with Jiang Qin, but she kept an eye on Ye Qingtang. When she saw that Jiang Qin had injured Ye Qingtang, Mo Yi’s pale face instantly turned crimson.

“Jiang Qin, how dare you injure my daughter!”

The next instant, Mo Yi soared upwards and struck. A huge white glow, like lightning, shot towards Jiang Qin.

Jiang Qin was shocked and hurriedly withdrew. She raised her eyes to look at Mo Yi with a cold smile on her lips.

“Mo Yi, I not only want to injure her, but I want to break your daughter’s neck in front of you!”

“I’ll kill you!” Mo Yi’s eyes were half-hooded. Her dark pupils seemed to slowly dilate until they covered the whites of her eyes.

Before Mo Yi could get away, Jiang Shun pressed towards her, not giving Mo Yi an opportunity to rescue Ye Qingtang.

“Mo Yi, open your eyes and look at me carefully, so you can see how I twist off your daughter’s head,” Jiang Qin said with a cold smirk. Then, she attacked Ye Qingtang with a flying leap.

Mo Yi was frantic, but Jiang Shun hampered her and did not give her a chance to leave. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Scram!” Mo Yi gave a low shout.

Jiang Shun laughed coldly.

“Mo Yi, this is your retribution. You injured my son. Today, your daughter is going to be killed before your eyes. This is retribution. Hahaha.”

By then, Mo Yi’s eyes had turned completely black. A black vein stretched from her temple to her cheek. Her skin seemed to grow even paler. She looked like a demon who had crawled out of hell. Her powers suddenly grew exponentially.

The smug expression was suddenly wiped off Jiang Shun’s face. His eyes filled with shock when he saw that Mo Yi’s powers had suddenly surged.

What is happening?

“All of you shall die!” Mo Yi suddenly spoke. Her voice was imbued with a faint, plaintive wail. Her speed instantly doubled. Shocked, Jiang Shun hurriedly moved to defend himself.

Meanwhile, Ye Qingtang saw that Jiang Qin was moving step by step closer to her. But she remained completely calm.

“Ye Qingtang. Of all things, you should never have offended my You’er. Who do you think you are to pit yourself against You’er? Today… will be the day you die.” Jiang Qin had no regard for Ye Qingtang, and she laughed coldly as she drew nearer.

Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes slightly and secretly stimulated the energy in her body.

Jiang Qin suddenly struck. A red light shot out from behind her. Her movements transformed into a blur of light, as if she was a flame streaking across the area.

The instant Jiang Qin attacked, the black flames around Ye Qingtang surged. The towering black flames instantly transformed into a black phoenix, which charged straight at Jiang Qin.

Jiang Qin was slightly taken aback. She had not expected Ye Qingtang to have such a move. She had a bad feeling about these black flames.

The demon fox servants had assumed that Ye Qingtang was no match for Jiang Qin and had not expected her to be able to withstand Jiang Qin’s attack.

Mo Yi had also noticed this. Her lips curved slightly, and the black vein on her face gradually vanished.

Just as Mo Yi relaxed a little, a black figure suddenly charged out from behind her.

Elder Meng suddenly appeared. The moment Mo Yi relaxed, he aimed a blow at Mo Yi’s back.
