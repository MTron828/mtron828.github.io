Chapter 46: The Great Elder (2)

“But I’m indeed rather tired. I’ll retire to my room then.” The Great Elder stated with an indifferent look and left without waiting for Ye Ling’s response.

Only after the Great Elder left the hall did Ye Ling gradually loosen up.

“Tang Tang, now that the Great Elder has returned, you might want to go out less often. Your second uncle is due to return from his training in a few days; we’ll go and receive him then.” Ye Ling had his worries, as his health deteriorated over these years, on top of the Second Elder’s sequestered training, the Great Elder was getting brazenly assertive in his ways.

Ye Ling was not a fool, he had by now noticed the Great Elder’s ruthless ambition.

But Ye Ling was unable to contend with him at present and could only play by his rules till the Second Elder’s return, when they could finally confront the Great Elder.

Now, Ye Ling was mostly concerned with Ye Qingtang’s safety. He was afraid the Great Elder would lay hands on his daughter who was the heir to the head of the household, and thus gave his forewarning.

Ye Qingtang heaved a sigh to herself as she looked at her worried father.

She was aware her father’s caution was a consequence of ensuring her safety. Even after the Great Elder subverted all his authority as head of the household, her father never retaliated, all for the sake of her safety.

However….

Little did her father knew, she had already come to harm.

In her past, Ye Qingtang was coerced by the Great Elder into keeping mum. Her reason to remain silent this time however, was to prevent causing further distress for her father.

“Duly noted, father.” Ye Qingtang nodded meekly.

Ye Ling was then relieved.

“Your performance during the rites today was marvelous. As your father, even I’m amazed how strong you’ve become. But still, rest early and be ready in these few days. Once your second uncle returns, everything’ll work out for the best.”

“Yes, father”

Though Ye Qingtang agreed to Ye Ling’s notion, she could not unwind like him.

That was because the Great Elder was fully aware of Ye Ling’s plan to confront him upon the Second Elder’s return.

Thus, in the past, the Great Elder actually had him assassinated a day before the Second Elder’s return and in turn, framed the Second Elder for his murder, killing two birds with one stone and eliminating them both.

This time, Ye Qingtang would avert the Great Elder’s treacherous scheme at all costs.

With that in mind, she narrowed her eyes and returned to her room swiftly.

The medicine she had prepared for Ye Ling was already mixed into his tea daily. Those medicine would slowly neutralize the poison in his body. Without Ye Ling himself noticing, his condition had improved considerably over these few days.

But….

She was still a long way off from being able to adeptly deal with the Great Elder and required more preparations….

Ye Xun had been in a foul mood ever since she returned from the Duan household.

Previously, she was the one who informed Duan Tianrao in secret, of Ye Qingtang’s shattered spirit root and her supposedly hideous appearance. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

But today, Ye Qingtang had put her in a tight spot. Even without Duan Tianrao voicing his misgivings, Ye Xun clearly felt his change in attitude towards herself.

“Ye Qingtang, why must you always get in my way?” Ye Xun heaved a deep breath discreetly, as she tried hard to turn her mood around before stepping into the Ye residence.

Upon returning, she heard news of the Great Elder’s arrival, and her anguish receded an instant.

She had long since joined the ranks of the Great Elder and was obviously well aware of his ambitions. Now with his return, neither Ye Ling nor Ye Qingtang could hope to live in peace!
