Chapter 1587 White Magician 1

The halo of light surrounding Ye Qingtang seemed to interlace with the moonlight. How pure, holy, and sacred it was!“This is... white magic...” The Bishop of York said, and his mouth was hung ajar in disbelief.

It was rumored that the source of magic originally existed in this mainland, and those who possessed the source of magic were divided into two camps: one was black magic, which was used by followers of the devil, while the other was white magic, which represented a believer of the gods.

However, after a massive disaster, those who had black magic and white magic died successively, and all traces of magic was wiped out from this mainland. All that people knew was just rumors regarding magic.

Recently, people would always relate disasters to the black witches who once mastered black magic, while the ambassadors of the white magic never appeared ever again.

Yet, at this very instant, the Bishop of York’s heart palpitated fiercely.

As a member of the Vatican, he had read various documents in the Vatican that recorded information on white magic. The most obvious description of white magic was none other than its color.

Clean, pure-white, and flawless like that of moonlight.

The Bishop of York suddenly felt great pressure, and his soul even shuddered from this feeling. Wasn’t the white light surrounding the girl coming from none other than the one and only white magic?

“Bishop of York, quickly execute your holy powers and eliminate this black witch!” The crowd in the surroundings was unaware of the Bishop of York’s shock as they were anxiously seeking protection.

Towering above everyone, Ye Qingtang frowned slightly as she looked at the incredulously foolish people with faint impatience.

She did not intend to carelessly kill anyone in this constellation world, but it would be a different story if they came down on her.

At this moment, the Vatican knights in the surroundings saw Ye Qingtang, who suddenly dashed out of the fire ring, and they viewed her as a powerful enemy. Then, they immediately gripped onto their spears and threw it toward the girl in the sky!

Numerous spears turned into bolts of light and flew across the sky.

Ye Qingtang looked at the incoming spears emotionlessly. Lifting her sleeve slightly, she released a little spirit energy and crushed those sturdy spears into dust in a flash!

Screams erupted among the crowd as they witnessed such a sight.

However, the light in the Bishop of York’s eyes intensified.

This has to be it!

I’m sure of it!

Apart from the legendary source of magic, what else could achieve such tremendous power?

The Vatican knights forcefully suppressed their fear when they noticed that the black witch’s magic became increasingly stronger. They took the bow and arrow on their backs, drew the bowstring, and prepared to attack the “black witch” in the sky.

To protect their land, they shall not fear black magic.

Ye Qingtang’s brows slightly. She vaguely sensed that these people mistook her for some scary thing, but she did not do anything that was out of line and did not have any intention to harm them despite their harassment. Why did they still not understand?

“Er... You cannot hurt them...” The God of Nature who had remained mum for a long time suddenly spoke when Ye Qingtang gradually lost her patience.

“Why?” Ye Qingtang asked calmly.

“Because this is related to the mission that I’m giving you.” The God of Nature smiled.
