Chapter 808 A Kind Act (3)

“Stay with her.” Han Cangming looked coldly at the silver wolf that was transformed using the killing intent around him.

Han Cangming could absorb the killing intent in the world, and his blood was full of killing intent. If he wanted to, he could separate some of the killing intent, which could then possess a certain level of consciousness once it condensed and took a form.

Just like this silver wolf before them.

“What the f*ck. You’re going to leave already, but you still made this plaything to hog space.” The little white tiger looked at the silver wolf which was transformed from killing intent.

Han Cangming cast the little white tiger a look.

The little white tiger snorted. “Hurry up and leave if you’re leaving. Since you wish to help her find her mother’s whereabouts, leave swiftly.”

They were beside Ye Qingtang the whole time today and naturally could tell that Ye Qingtang had the intention of searching for her mother.

With Han Cangming wanting to leave now, what else could it be other than for this matter?

Han Cangming ignored the little white tiger’s clamor and simply walked to Ye Qingtang’s side. Looking at the ring on her finger, he drew out some spiritual energy from his glabella and injected it into the ring.

Ye Qingtang might not know where her mother went.

But Han Cangming knew.

Her mother had left this mainland over ten years ago.

If she wanted to find her, the only option was to head to the Central Mainland.

There was a complicated expression in Han Cangming’s eyes as he looked at the girl who was sleeping soundly.

He had witnessed the girl grow stronger step by step, and she was never a weak person who needed to be protected under someone’s wing.

Then, Han Cangming headed out of the living quarters, and his figure vanished in a flash.

“What the f*ck. He finally left.” The little white tiger wiggled its ears as it watched Han Cangming leave before looking at the silver wolf that recovered slightly. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The silver wolf’s gaze was slightly fiercer than before, but it took a look at the ring on Ye Qingtang’s hand apprehensively. Afterward, the silver wolf automatically looked at the little white tiger at aside, and the ferocious expression emerged in its eyes once again.

A trace of coldness passed by the little white tiger’s eyes, and an extremely overbearing aura poured out of its body.

The silver wolf was shocked to see the aura around the little white tiger, and it crouched on the ground in fear.

“What the f*ck. How dare you bare your fangs at me.” The little white tiger snickered coldly with narrowed eyes.

The silver wolf sprawled on the ground, trembling. It was filled with grievances, yet it did not dare to move an inch.

The next morning, Ye Qingtang woke up from her slumber.

She seemed to be exceptionally deep in sleep last night.

She changed her clothes and put on her disguise once again before bringing the little white tiger and silver wolf out of the living quarters. It might be a misperception, but she felt that the silver wolf seemed a little strange today, and she did not know what was strange.

Its aura was clearly the same.

Feeling that she was perhaps overthinking, Ye Qingtang left the hall and was greeted by Long Jiang and the Blood Moon Elder, who had been waiting outside the hall for a long time.

“The Grand Imperial Sire wanted me to hand this token to you.” Long Jiang walked forward and handed a token to Ye Qingtang.

There was a lifelike dragon carved on the token.

“The Grand Imperial Sire bestowed this token to Her Lordship back then, and she returned it to him before she left. This token can command anyone of the Nine Nights Dynasty.” Long Jiang explained slowly.

Ye Qingtang picked up the token and stored it in her space ring. “I still have some matters to settle and will take a leave first.”

Then, she told the Blood Moon Elder. “Miss Ouyang can return first as well.”

The Blood Moon Elder did not have any objections.

Looking at the clear and boundless sky, Ye Qingtang immediately set off to the Bliss Forging Workshop.
