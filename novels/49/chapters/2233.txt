Chapter 2234: A Gathering (3)

Although Ye Qingtang had escaped, the Temple of Paragon remained suspicious of her identity. Ye Qingtang never dreamed that her appearance would change the history of the Evil Soul Forest.

Looking at the massive factions gathering here, Ye Qingtang finally understood why they were suddenly investing so many resources into the Evil Soul Forest.

Although Ye Qingtang had lingered in the Evil Soul Forest for a long, she had yet to find the Evil Fruit. As such she was eighty percent certain that the Evil Fruit was inside the fiendcelestial’s tomb.

If these people all entered the fiendcelestial’s tomb...

Ye Qingtang could more or less bid farewell to the Evil Fruit.

But...

A treasure that required so many people to raid the tomb. Ye Qingtang believed that... the difficulty level must be exceptional.

The only piece of luck was that she had yet to see any signs of people from the Temple of Paragon. Otherwise, she would have to immediately flee.

Just as Ye Qingtang was pondering over how to sneak around amongst the various factions, a tiny figure suddenly appeared in Ye Qingtang line of vision.

Amongst the factions, Mu Ziying’s hands were bound. Trapped in the crowd, her face was filled with bruises and extremely pallid. Her puppet was in a wretched state and tied to her waist.

“What happened? Why is Muying here?” Ye Qingtang was astonished.

She clearly remembered, especially making sure that they didn’t venture too far from the cave, before heading out herself.

Why had Mu Ziying been captured?

Ye Qingtang saw the faction who had caught Mu Ziying.

“Those are... men from Rising Dragon Island?”

The Rising Dragon Island was an independent island in the Second Domain. It was not very big but very isolated from the rest of the world. The Rising Dragon Island was extremely mysterious to the outsiders. Rumor had it that they were an organization of assassins.

As long as you could pay, they could kill anyone you wanted to be killed.

But the price was set by the Rising Dragon Island.

Money, treasures, elixirs... sometimes even your own life... one had to satisfy the Rising Dragon Island men’s demands if you wished to obtain their help.

Ye Qingtang felt that things were not good at all now that Mu Ziying had fallen into their hands. If Mu Ziying was here, where were Nangong Lie and the rest? Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

What had happened?

“Rising Dragon Island, don’t tell me you are also on this Evil Soul Forest mission?” Shi Shangfei led his men forward. He surveyed the Rising Dragon Island men and noticed Mu Ziying. Surprise flashed across his eyes.

He had seen this girl before.

The Rising Dragon Island and Spy Cloud were both in the “trading” profession, just in different directions. Nevertheless, they had some past dealings and some form of relationship.

A black-clad man who was the Rising Dragon Island’s leader glanced at Mu Ziying before saying, “None of Spy Cloud’s business.”

Shi Shangfei kept silent.

But a member of a beast race who was over three meters in height narrowed his eyes. He sized up Mu Ziying.

“This girl looks somewhat familiar. Isn’t she the one whom the Puppet Emperor is giving a reward to whoever finds her?”

Everyone reacted on hearing the words “Puppet Emperor”.

The Puppet Emperor was a legendary practitioner in the Second Domain. His powers were not that remarkable but the most fearsome thing about him was his puppet skills...
