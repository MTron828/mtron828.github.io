The battle of the demons was yet to be over. The shouts below were deafening, and the air was gradually stained with the intense stench of blood.

“Teacher Ye Qing, what should we do now?”

A moment later, the Flying Star Academy teacher looked at Ye Qing and asked. Arriving at this unfamiliar space, everyone now looked to Ye Qing as their leader. Although they had never come to this strange realm with demons before, it did not mean that Ye Qing had not.

After all, Ye Qing knew the Space Technique. Perhaps he had been to this realm before.

“We wait.”

“Wait?”

Everyone was taken aback by her words.

Given the current situation, shouldn’t they find a hidden place to wait for a few days and then leave this realm after Ye Qing’s energy replenished? Wait… what did that mean?

“Boss, are we going to wait right here?” Mu Ziying looked at Ye Qing.

Ye Qingtang nodded slightly. “Just wait here.”

“Teacher Ye Qing, there is a major battle between demons below. Isn’t it too dangerous for us to stay here?” Lu Yuanxiang frowned slightly. He could not understand Ye Qing’s suggestion.

It wasn’t that Lu Yuanxiang was afraid of death. It was just that he wanted to protect the lives of these students. Seeing that there was hope for them to live, how could he be willing to wait here for death?

“There’s no hurry. Just listen to me,” Ye Qingtang said softly.

Upon hearing what Ye Qing said, Lu Yuanxiang and the Flying Star Academy teacher naturally could not say anything else. They could only follow Ye Qing’s instructions and stay where they were.

Qin Feng, Mu Ziying and the rest did not doubt Ye Qing at all. Even if Ye Qing asked them to go down and fight those demons, they would not hesitate to do so.

“Sigh, look, those demons are so strong… if I was that strong, I’d be able to do whatever I wanted once I got out of here.” Lei Yan laid down on the mountain top, popping his head out to watch the battle below with a serious expression.

“What a joke! They are so strong solely because they are demons. What makes you think you can compare to a demon? But actually, I really do have a method.” Nangong Lie scoffed from the side.

“What method?” Lei Yan asked.

“That’s simple. If you go down now, those demons will definitely skin you and put you on themselves. This way, won’t you have the strength of demons?” Nangong Lie laughed loudly. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Lei Yan let out a cold harrumph. “How can you… say such things?”

“Stop chattering!”

Lu Yuanxiang glanced at Lei Yan and Nangong Lie with displeasure.

If the demons below discovered them, the consequences would be unimaginable.

Nangong Lie and Lei Yan tactfully shut their mouths when they saw the displeasure on Lu Yuanxiang’s face.

After about an hour, the fight between the two sides drifted further and further away, leaving only the corpses of the demons.

After another hour, after confirming that all the demons had left, Ye Qingtang stood up and walked down the slope.

“Teacher Ye Qing… What are you doing?”

Lu Yuanxiang was shocked when he saw Ye Qing walking out.

“It’s alright. Everyone, come down.” Ye Qingtang did not even look back..
