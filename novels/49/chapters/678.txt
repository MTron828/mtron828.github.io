Wasn’t it just being a woman?

He would just go all out!

Ye Qingtang looked at the blissful Blood Moon Elder and did not know whether to laugh or cry. She increasingly felt that her cheap brother must have been blind to let the Blood Moon Elder attain the position as an Elder back then.

Just as Ye Qingtang secretly chuckled, she suddenly felt a sharp gaze on her.

She looked up discreetly but realized that Qin Chen was scanning her with a sharp and intense gaze.

“Young Sir Ye, thank you for your help this time. I am Qin Chen, the son of the Nine Nights Dynasty’s premier. If there’s anything you need help with in the future, just let me know.” When Qin Chen sensed Ye Qingtang’s gaze, the sharpness in his eyes faded away quietly, and it was replaced with a dashing smile like that of a distinguished young sir.

Ye Qingtang was wearing plain clothes which were made from relatively ordinary material and did not have any accessories on her. Compared to Qin Chen who was donned in an elegant outfit, she naturally did not have a noble air to her.

“You’re too polite, Young Sir Qin. I still have something on. I’m just sending Miss Ouyang back first today. Now that she has safely reached, I’ll take my leave,” Ye Qingtang said plainly.

Hearing that Ye Qingtang was leaving, the Blood Moon Elder, who was initially gleeful over the treasures he just obtained, immediately looked up. “What? You’re leaving now?”

Although Ye Qingtang did tell him of the plan for the coming time, the Blood Moon Elder did not think that she would leave so quickly.

Perhaps because he was a little anxious, there were traces of nervousness in his tone.

However, that nervousness had a different meaning in Qin Chen’s ears.

Qin Chen narrowed his eyes secretly, sizing up the young man. Although that young man was wearing simple and plain clothes, his exquisite features were too striking, and even Qin Chen had rarely seen such a good-looking male.

Qin Chen knew of his father’s plan from a long time ago and had been deliberately creating opportunities to get closer to Ouyang Qian.

He did not expect Ye Chen to appear out of nowhere. It should be known that not only was Ye Chen Ouyang Qian’s life savior, he was also extremely handsome, and the two of them had been spending time together alone for some time before she returned.

If Ouyang Qian’s heart was really moved by Ye Chen…

Qin Chen frowned secretly. No one was allowed to disrupt his plans.

“Yes, Miss Ouyang. I still have things to do,” Ye Qingtang said without emotions.

Anyway, she saw that the Blood Moon Elder was completely into his new identity, and she did not need to worry at all.

The Blood Moon Elder could not say anything further. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ouyang Jian was generous and ordered people to prepared many gifts of thanks for Ye Qingtang, which she accepted all without declining.

Her behavior put Ouyang Jian’s mind slightly more at ease.

Qin Chen did not say anything and merely observed Ye Qingtang’s every action, seeming to be thinking about something.

“I’ll take my leave then.” Ye Qingtang bade farewell to the Blood Moon Elder and brought the little white tiger out of the Ouyang family clan.

As long as the Blood Moon Elder could maintain his identity in the Ouyang family clan, she believed that she could find out the origins of her jade pendant with the Ouyang family clan’s influence in no time.
