Chapter 930 Inheritance Of The Bloodline (1)

Once they took the Dharma treasures here, in the future, they could not oppose the successor of the Divine Phoenix and also needed to give a certain amount of help.

No wonder the Divine Phoenix was so generous.

In order to obtain these treasures, everyone had no choice but to agree.

The successor of the Divine Phoenix would certainly be either Ye Qingtang or the girl in green. As there was no enmity between them and Ye Qingtang or the girl in green, of course, they would not oppose them in the future. They also had no problem helping them as much as possible. This was nothing compared to the Dharma treasures.

“Lord Divine Phoenix, in the future, if the successor of the Divine Phoenix needs any help, I will do my best,” said the old man in black, who had obtained the Herb of Heavenly Life, as he went forward.

“So will I.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“No problem at all. In the future, all of us can be considered as kin to the Divine Phoenix. It is natural that we should help each other!”

The ten plus cultivators spoke readily.

“Mere words are not enough. You must sign the Heavenly Dao Blood Pact,” said the Divine Phoenix.

The ten over cultivators had no choice but to sign the Heavenly Dao Blood Pact with the Divine Phoenix. In the future, they must not oppose the successor of the Divine Phoenix and needed to provide as much help as they could. If they failed to do so, they would suffer the effects of the Heavenly Dao Blood Pact!

“Very well. Now that you have obtained part of my inheritance, you are considered my disciples. I hope we will be destined to meet again.” The Divine Phoenix was relieved. With that, the bodies of the ten plus people slowly vanished as they were sent out by the Divine Phoenix.

At that moment, only Ye Qingtang and the girl in green were left in the palace.

“The inheritance of the Divine Phoenix will emerge among the two of you,” said the Divine Phoenix.

When they heard that, Ye Qingtang nodded, but the girl in green expressed her thanks.

“I will test your martial talent, spirit root, and bloodlines.”

As the Divine Phoenix spoke, it moved over to the girl in green.

A scarlet glow shrouded in the girl in green.

“Top martial talents… blue spirit root among the red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue and purple of the mortal world…”

Shrouded by the scarlet glow, the girl in green’s talent and spirit root were completely exposed.

“Blue spirit root…”

Ye Qingtang was thoughtful. This was no ordinary girl.

One must know that a blue spirit root had not appeared for many years in this mainland.

At that time, Ye Qingtang’s spirit root was already considered extremely rare in this mainland.

And it was only a green spirit root.

But the girl in front of her was actually a blue spirit root.

However, before Ye Qingtang had time to think further, an image of the Divine Phoenix emerged from the girl in green’s body.

“Phoenix bloodline?!”

When it saw the girl’s phoenix bloodline, the Divine Phoenix’s eyes showed a trace of surprise that quickly transformed into joy.

If the successor of the Divine Phoenix had the phoenix bloodline, that would be even better!

“Phoenix bloodline?!” Ye Qingtang was stunned. She had not thought that this girl in green would possess the phoenix bloodline…

“Ling Yan, your calculations had better be correct…” At that moment, Ye Qingtang felt a little worried.

This girl in green had not behaved unusually and had not attracted anyone’s attention. Who would have thought… she would be so extraordinary?

“Very good.” After a long time, the Divine Phoenix nodded at the girl in green. It was extremely satisfied with the girl in green’s condition. The inheritance of the Divine Phoenix seemed to be tailor-made for her.

“Lord Divine Phoenix, since that is the case, is it still necessary to continue?” The girl in green was not at all surprised by the outcome. Her delicate-looking face was filled with self-confidence. She glanced at Ye Qingtang out of the corner of her eye.
