Chapter 938 Devouring Bloodline (1)

However, shortly after Ye Qingtang left the palace, the girl in green slowly emerged from behind a huge tree.

It was the same girl one who had passed to the last stage of the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix with Ye Qingtang.

The girl had been confident that she would win when the Divine Phoenix had passed over her at the last moment.

Instead, it was Ye Qingtang who obtained the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix.

At that moment, the girl in green was looking at Ye Qingtang with ice-cold eyes. She had clearly been waiting for a long time. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The girl in green slowly walked towards Ye Qingtang.

“You have finally come out. I have been waiting here for a long time.” The girl in green glared at Ye Qingtang and spoke coldly. Her eyes were filled with intense coldness.

“Oh?” Ye Qingtang stared at the girl in green and said calmly, “I have no dealings with you and don’t know you. Why are you waiting here for me?”

“Nothing much. I just wanted to congratulate you,” said the girl in green.

“Congratulate me?” The corners of the Ye Qingtang’s mouth curved slightly, and she laughed coldly. “Thanks.”Read more at L isnovel

“However,” said the girl in green, as she suddenly narrowed her eyes. Her tone also changed. “Good things should be shared. The inheritance of the Divine Phoenix is the power of the original Phoenix Bloodline and is very pure. Can you share some of it with me? Otherwise, with your spirit root and ability, possessing such a pure and powerful bloodline will only endanger your life and bring calamity.”

The girl in green gave Ye Qingtang a disdainful look.

A mere yellow spirit root…

“What you mean is… that you intend to seize the power of my bloodline.” Ye Qingtang laughed coldly as she looked at the girl in green.

But Ye Qingtang was curious. The power of a bloodline was integrated with one’s body. Unlike a spirit root, which had a physical body, and hence could be dug out from the body, it was impossible to seize the power of a bloodline.

However, the girl in green seemed to be planning to seize her Phoenix Bloodline. How was she going to do that?

“Ah…” The girl in green laughed coldly. Her proud glance passed over Ye Qingtang, and her expression clearly showed her disdain. “I am not seizing; I am merely taking back. Only someone powerful can control and possess a powerful bloodline. It is not something that belongs to a weakling like you.”

As she spoke, the girl’s frightening aura instantly diffused and spread out in a 10-meter-wide circle that enclosed Ye Qingtang.

“Divine Arcane Supremacy…”

Ye Qingtang’s eyes narrowed when she sensed the girl in green’s martial aura.

The girl in green was worthy of having peak martial talents and a blue spirit root. To have achieved this grade at her age, it was no exaggeration to say that she was a genius.

If not for an accidental abortion of her plan, in the future, the girl in green would become a powerful cultivator of at least the Holy Venerate level, or perhaps even an Emperor-level supreme chief, which was above the level of Holy Venerate.

It was just that although the girl in green had reached the stage of Divine Arcane Supremacy, in this mainland where spirit energy was scarce, the girl in green’s martial abilities and cultivation were repressed to the level of Yin Yang Perfected Lord Eighth Heaven.

Ye Qingtang had just obtained the bloodline passed to her by the Divine Phoenix and also possessed the Mirror of Illusions. Her own martial abilities had reached the stage of Yin Yang Perfected Lord Seventh Heaven, so she had no reason to fear the girl in green.

“You think you can beat me?” The eyes of the girl in green were cold and remote. “Do you think that you have nothing to fear because you have obtained the inheritance of the original phoenix?”
