Chapter 25: Bent Grass (1)

However, Ye Qingtang was not in the slightest bit distressed by this predicament. On the contrary, she put on a smile instead and said to the assistant: “Call your manager.”

The assistant was a little surprised by her sudden request, “Miss Ye, if there’s anything you need, you may just ask me to….”

“Call your manager, if you want Bent Grasses.” Ye Qingtang interrupted and gave him a rather cold-eyed gaze.

When met with her icy gaze, the assistant suddenly felt his blood chill. But, when she mentioned “Bent Grass”, he started to tremble, due to another reason though.

Duan Tianrui did not know what Ye Qingtang had up her sleeve and only assumed she was making a fool of herself. He urged the assistant instead: “Feel free to get your manager, I will… ”

Before he could finish his sentence, the assistant had already scurried off.

Within moments, the assistant returned in a hurry, accompanied by a man in his fifties.

“Miss Ye, I’m the manager of this boutique. Pleased to meet you.” The middle-aged man greeted Ye Qingtang before cutting to the chase, “I’ve heard from my assistant regarding the Bent Grass you’ve mentioned, may I know… any information you had about it?”

Although the manager remained composed while talking, his eyes echoed his eagerness.

The Bent Grass was a precious herb sought after by the owner of the Pavilion of Treasures. Its requisition was put up across all the branches in the continent, promising a hefty reward of ten thousand gold for every Bent Grass found. However, until now, not the slightest clue of its location was known.

“I know where you can find them.” Ye Qingtang stated plainly.

Duan Tianrui sneered from a side once having heard what she claimed.

A girl who was not even sixteen and had never stepped a foot outside the city; where would she learn the whereabouts of that rare herb?

The manager’s eyes gleamed in anticipation, “Miss Ye, we can assure you’ll be appropriately rewarded once you’ve provided us with that information.”

Ye Qingtang spoke without hesitation: “It’s in the Withered Woods just outside the city.”

Duan Tianrui nearly burst out laughing at her “revelation”.

The Withered Woods was situated along the City of Lin. Although it housed several types of herbs, but all of them were known to be common ones. Only a fool would hope to find Bent Grasses growing there.

No one would believe such an outrageous claim.

The manager did not expect Ye Qingtang to mention the Withered Woods. His burning anticipation, like fire being doused with ice water, vanished in an instant and his face became rigid with disappointment.

“Miss Ye, you must be joking, that’s impossible.”

“What if its true?” Ye Qingtang followed up by saying: “Get someone to prepare paper and ink, I’ll draw its exact location for you.”

The manager considered her info to be hogwash, but judging from her air of confidence, although he furrowed his brow and hesitated for a moment, he passed the order to prepare the stationery she requested.

Ye Qingtang drew a simple map on the fly, with the supposed location of the Bent Grass pinpointed on it.

The manager handed the map over to one of his trusted assistants.

The crowd of bystanders, who witnessed the assistant leaving with the map had their faces piqued with curiosity. No one knew how Ye Qingtang found the confidence to come up with that map. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The manager had heard from his assistant, about Duan Tianrui and her dispute over the ownership of the Flora moonstone. Now that he had sent his assistant to check on the authenticity of her claims, though the result seemed mire like everyone expected, but the manager still decided to place his bet on that one in a millionth chances of hitting the jackpot. “Mr Duan, please wait for a moment till we work this out.” The manager requested from Duan Tianrui.

Duan Tianrui smirked and said: “No hurries. I too hope your good establishment is able to find that herb.” With that said, he gave Ye Qingtang a dirty look.
