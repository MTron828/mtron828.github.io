Chapter 1170: A Collective Battle (3)

The Sect Master of Peerless School wished to gather even more strength now to delay more time. Although just one Yang Lord, Ye Qingtang, did not matter much to the overall situation of the South battlefield, it was better than nothing to have the combat power of an additional Yang Lord.

As long as they could buy enough time, perhaps the North or East battlefield would have news of victory soon.

By then, Pagoda Sword Master or Ultimate Elder would definitely be able to deploy troops to aid the South battlefield.

Ye Qingtang knew what the Peerless School Sect Master was thinking of, and although it was a good idea, reality was extremely cruel.

Currently, with the You Ancient Clan increasing the number of powerful figures in the South battlefield, Ultimate Elder and Pagoda Sword Master could only barely resist the You Ancient Clan in their own battlefields, and this merely slowed down You Ancient Clan’s momentum in the complete invasion.

As time passed, the poison in the You Ancient Clan members would weaken, and their skills would conversely increase, causing the annihilation of this mainland to be just a matter of time.

While Little You Yun could control the spirit energy on this mainland and produce even more Yang Lords, this was merely delaying the death of this mainland.

It was almost unrealistic to completely defeat the You Ancient Clan as its might was perhaps way beyond imagination.

It was a pity that Divine King Luo Xue and those obscure ancient clan figures who could fight against Divine King Luo Xue had already died.

Otherwise, any one of them with the power of a Yin Yang Perfected Lord Tenth Heaven could turn the situation around! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Regardless of such, no one would sit around and wait for death. Even though they knew it was impossible to succeed, they could not wait for death to arrive.

“What do you want us to do?” Elder Bai Kui looked at the Peerless School Sect Master and asked.

“Head to the battlefield and stop You Ancient Clan’s continued invasion!” Peerless School Sect Master said.

The thousands of people in the hall successively looked at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang was now the absolute core of Falling Sky Valley. If she agreed, they would follow her orders as part of their incumbent duty, but if she refused, they would not listen to the Peerless School Sect Master to head to the battlefield.

“We understand. It is our foremost duty to play a part now that the mainland is in trouble. Once we are done settling with the valley’s matters, we will head to the battlefield immediately to protect our homeland.” Ye Qingtang looked at the Peerless School Sect Master and promised.

“Alright. I will not impose on you any further.” The Peerless School Sect Master cupped his fists in gratitude and left.

After the Peerless School Sect Master left, Perfected Xuanchen looked at Ye Qingtang and asked, “Qingtang, will we be able to guard the South battlefield?”

Perfected Xuanchen had never witnessed the You Ancient Clan’s prowess before; thus, he was unclear. However, if they could be so powerful that both Pagoda Sword Master and Ultimate Elder could not do much against them, they must be extremely powerful.

“Very difficult,” Ye Qingtang said honestly.

The situation of the South battlefield was not optimistic, and it could even be said to be the most dangerous battlefield out of the three battlefields.

It was already very hard for the ancient clan Master, Peerless School, and Beiming Manor to resist until now.

Although Ye Qingtang did not wish to boost other people’s morale and reduce one’s own courage, the fact was such, and there was nothing they could do.

However, although they were unable to defeat the You Ancient Clan, the participation of the Falling Sky Valley would definitely slow down the You Ancient Clan’s invasion, and there may be a turn in the situation in this period of time.
