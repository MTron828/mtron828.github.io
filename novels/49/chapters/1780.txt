Chapter 1781: Blood Battle (1)

The chasm grew wider bit by bit right before the eyes of the fiendish demons. It was pitch black inside the chasm, from which a bone-chilling wind blew out.

The eyes of the Great Generals from the big three tribes instantly lit up.

The sealed space was finally opening. Their highly-coveted Deity Ocean was right inside!

At this point, the three elite tribes were not the only ones who were excited. The ambitions of all the other camps were also ignited.

“The sealed space is opening now. The Deity Ocean is right inside!” Someone suddenly shouted out. The originally quiet demon crowd suddenly charged toward the opening of the sealed space.

But before they could get anywhere near it, the fiendish demons of the three major tribes had already made their move.

“It looks like we are not the only ones who are interested in the Deity Ocean.” The Great General of the Earth Demon Tribe narrowed his eyes with a smirk.

“Those weaklings?” The Great General of the Heavenly Demon Tribe snorted coldly, his eyes filled with disdain.

“Now that the sealed space has opened and the Deity Ocean is just within, the number of competitors and variables will increase exponentially. I wonder what do the two of you think of that?” The Great General of the Emperor Demon Tribe asked.

They ignored the other camps earlier as they meant nothing to them. But now that the Deity Ocean had appeared, the three Great Generals noticed that the other camps were all gearing up to fight for the treasure.

“They will have to prove themselves worthy of fighting for the Deity Ocean. Why don’t the three of us leave behind a certain number of troops to prevent those weaklings from disrupting our quest?” The Great General of the Earth Demon Tribe suggested.

The other two Great Generals nodded in agreement. In just a short period of time, each of the three major tribes split into two groups. One team was to stay behind while the other team would enter the sealed space. The former would be in charge of preventing the other demon camps from entering the sealed space.

The three major powers were collaborating only for the sake of obtaining the Deity Ocean for themselves.

Crowds of fiendish demons charged toward the open space. The fiendish demons left behind to guard the sealed space formed an impenetrable barrier. Meanwhile, the Great Generals’ three steeds had also been left outside.

“Roar!” The Flaming Ape howled. Raising one arm, it smacked a bunch of fiendish demons in front of it, crushing them to a pulp.

The thick smell of blood permeated the air. The rest of the demons were all momentarily taken aback by the bloody massacre.

Meanwhile, the Great Generals of the three top tribes had already entered the sealed space with part of their troops.

“We will kill whoever dares to take another step forward!” One of the fiendish demons from the Earth Demon Tribe warned in a low voice.

The authority that the three elite tribes had over the rest of the demons still lingered on. For a moment, a sliver of doubt appeared in the faces of those zealous fiendish demons.

“The three big tribes have already ruled this valley for so many years. Every demon camp should be allowed an opportunity to obtain the Deity Ocean. With the Deity Ocean in hand, we won’t need to fear you guys anymore!” Someone cried out. His words penetrated deep into the hearts of every fiendish demon.

Although the three elite tribes were powerful, the desperate desire for the Deity Ocean was also a persuasive force.

They were no match for the three major tribes now but they would become the King of fiendish demons if they obtained the Deity Ocean. By then, the three top tribes would be like tiny ants under their feet!Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m
