The number two on the Excellence Roll initially had the thought of challenging Ji Xianyuan, but after witnessing the sight, he completely waved the white flag and dropped the idea of snatching the number one position.

Only God knows that Ji Xianyuan was this powerful!

In the observation tower, Elder Lin saw Lin Feng’s defeat, but there was not much expression on his face. As the elders saw that there was no one else who went up to the ring, they knew that the inner sect assessment for this year would conclude soon.

“The top three on the Excellence Roll is already finalized. We should give them the qualifications to enter the inner sect.” Elder Lin stood up slowly and was about to grant the top three the inner sect entrance qualification with the other three elders.

The disciples in the square thought about how exciting the matches were today and wished they had such powerful skills as well.

Elder Huang, who was beside the ring, heaved a sigh of relief secretly. When he saw that the few elders walking out from the observation tower, Elder Huang immediately welcomed them with other outer sect elders.

“Greetings, elders,” Elder Huang said.

“Elder Huang, Yuan Wei did pretty well this year. The person you selected is amazing.” Elder Lin praised.

Elder Huang was delighted and felt that his face was glowing.

“Since the assessment this year has ended, the top three can be granted admission into the inner sect already,” Elder Lin said.

“Noted.” Elder Huang nodded and immediately turned to walk up the ring. Under everyone’s gaze, he announced, “The inner sect assessment today is already over…”

Before Elder Huang finished his sentence, a clear female voice suddenly sounded from the crowd.

“Elder Huang, I have not taken my assessment.”

With that, Elder Huang felt a tug on his heart, and everyone looked in the direction of the voice.

What appeared before their eyes was…

The small-framed Ye Qingtang was walking towards the ring.

This sight caused Elder Huang’s heart to rise up this throat!

Discussions exploded in the square!

“Ye Qingtang? She really dared to come?”

“It can’t be… I didn’t see her entering the ring these few days. I still thought those rumors were false.”

“Don’t joke anymore. With just that level of skills, she may just be beaten into a pulp by all these senior brothers. Don’t be blinded by her face.”

There was a flurry of discussions in the square. Everyone felt that Ye Qingtang must be crazy. Otherwise, why would she still dare to seek death after witnessing so many rounds of the competition?

As they were discussing, Ye Qingtang had already walked up to the ring and handed the assessment qualification waist tablet that she exchanged from Elder Qin into Elder Huang’s hands.

Elder Huang frowned in exasperation that his words fell on deaf ears and wished he could just pull Ye Qingtang down from the stage.

Does she know how dangerous this ring is!

“This is my assessment qualification. Please verify it, Elder Huang.”

Elder Huang’s lips twitched as he looked at the waist tablet in his hands and tried to maintain his composure.

“This is the waist tablet for the inner sect assessment. Are you aware that if you use this qualification, you’ll have to directly challenge the top three people on the Excellence Roll?” Elder Huang hinted at Ye Qingtang for the last time. Her waist tablet could allow her to skip the competitions in the previous day but also restricted the opponents that she had to challenge to the disciples who were placed in the top three positions.

“I am aware.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

Elder Huang was really mad that he did not know what to do. “Ye Qingtang, since that is what you want, I will permit you to start your assessment. However… remember not to force yourself.” In the end, Elder Huang still could not help but advise her again.
