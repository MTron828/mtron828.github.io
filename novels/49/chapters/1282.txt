Chapter 1283: Do Me A Favor? (3)

Duan Xirui naturally knew who Ye Qingtang was referring to. He almost subconsciously shook his head like a rattle and quickly clarified. “No, no, no… I don’t even know them. I don’t know them at all. I… I was only passing by… passing by… and spouted nonsense… just nonsense…” Duan Xirui stuttered. He was terrified that Long Yang would say that they had some connection.

Long Yang and the others thought that someone had come to save them. Now, they looked on as Duan Xirui, whom they thought of as incredibly powerful, almost wet himself from the terror of the Holy Lord of Shadows. Despair filled their hearts.

“Senior Duan! Senior Duan, you…”

“Shut up! What Senior Duan? I don’t even know you. Don’t pretend to have some connection with me.” Duan Xirui was immediately enraged and even aggrieved.

You brought about your own death. Don’t drag me into this!

Long Yang blanched as Duan Xirui scolded him.

Ye Qingtang saw that Duan Xirui knew what was good for him and said, “Get lost.”

“Yes, yes, yes. I will go now.” Duan Xirui did not hesitate and fled swiftly. He only wished he could grow another two legs so that he could flee a little faster.

Everyone in the Long Family lost heart when they saw their only savior abandon them.

Ming Gu did not stand on ceremony at all. He lifted his hand and instantly snapped their necks.

Blood spurted everywhere, and its thick scent spread through the air.

The Undead slaves who were saved all worshiped Ye Qingtang.

“Holy Lord, we will never forget your kindness!”

“Holy Lord, thank you for saving us!”

At that moment, the Undead slaves were all greatly moved.

The Holy Lord of Shadows had vanished for thousands of years. They thought that… the Holy Lord despised and rejected them.

But it turned out that…

Their Holy Lord had not abandoned them!

Their Holy Lord had finally returned!!

“Lady Ghost, make arrangements for them.” Ye Qingtang’s heart was conflicted when she saw the emotional Undead, who were kneeling on the ground.

No race should be oppressed. The power of the strong should not be used to crush the dignity of others.

Lady Ghost smilingly agreed. Under Ye Qingtang’s direction, Lady Ghost ordered the guards from the Temple of Shadows, who were still resting at the same spot, to deal with the matter. They not only released the group of slaves that they had met, but they also rescued all the Undead slaves from the mine shafts owned by the Long Family in that mining area.

Ye Qingtang could not help but lament inwardly when she saw the shabbily dressed and pitiful-looking Undead.

Although she was forced to take on the role of the Holy Lord of Shadows, at least… she had done something that she wanted to…

When arrangements had been made for the slaves, Ye Qingtang continued on her journey towards the Eternal Dynasty.

But a flame of hope had been lit in the hearts of the Undead slaves who had been rescued. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Their Holy Lord had finally returned!!

The Eternal Dynasty was one of the large dynasties in Central Mainland. It occupied a large area, and the entire dynasty was thriving. It was densely populated, and scenes of prosperity could be seen everywhere.

But now, everything was quiet in the capital city of the Eternal Dynasty.

The pedestrians all looked solemn. The lamps, which were usually brightly lit, were mostly covered with a white cloth.

The palace in the Eternal Dynasty was sunk into mourning.

A few princes and princesses congregated in the palace. The tragic keening of a girl could be heard in the huge hall. Her cries reverberated through the palace.
