Chapter 1478 Elder Cabinet 2

In reality, Ye You and Jiang Yiming were considered outstanding in ordinary family clans, but in the Jiang Family, they had no qualifications to enter the Elder Cabinet.

Ye Qingtang was thinking about this and did not notice that Jiang Lang and Mo Yi were looking at her with a complicated expression.

Their daughter could enter the Elder Cabinet originally as well.

Regardless of her other endowments, she could enter it solely based on the variant Heavenly Demon Bloodline in her body.

However, their daughter was lost the moment she was born. Although she was found now, the people in the Elder Cabinet began training from young to ensure a stable foundation. Yet, Ye Qingtang was left outside for over ten years and—what’s more—in the martially-lacking First Mainland…

Jiang Lang and his wife pondered about it but did not speak.

Meanwhile, Elder Xu passed through many corridors and arrived at the Elder Cabinet at the back of the Jiang Residence.

A cabinet elder was walking past the door right at that time, and he halted when he saw Elder Xu.

Elder Xu walked forward and bowed.

While both of them were Jiang Family elders, a cabinet elder’s position was incomparable.

“What is it?” The cabinet elder looked at Elder Xu and asked plainly.

Elder Xu said, “The people heading to the Land of Infinite Demons this time are confirmed. May I know which juniors from the Elder Cabinet will be heading there?”

Although Jiang Shangyu decided on the rough candidates, the junior candidates from the Elder Cabinet were not personally chosen by him and instead by the Elder Cabinet.

The Elder Cabinet nurtured remarkable talents of the Jiang Family and was the greatest backing of the Jiang Family. All the finest cultivation conditions were also selected by the Elder Cabinet first.

The cabinet elder pondered for a moment and said in a low voice, “Let Jiang Qi go then.”

Elder Xu was slightly taken aback when he heard the cabinet elder. Then, he seemed to recall something and spoke again. “There’s another matter. Jiang Lang’s daughter has returned to the Jiang Family. Jiang Liu and I have already tested her bloodline and found that the Heavenly Demon Bloodline in her body has mutated. I wonder if…” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

A variant Heavenly Demon Bloodline was extremely rare, and the Elder Cabinet was rather regretful over the disappearance of Jiang Lang’s daughter. If that child could be nurtured from young, perhaps she would be the greatest chip of the Jiang Family.

“Where did she grow up?” The cabinet elder asked.

“It seems to be the First Mainland.”

The cabinet elder frowned instinctively, and a trace of regret flashed across his eyes.

“The First Mainland’s martial culture is too mediocre. It’s truly a pity…”

If one did not build a solid foundation from young, it would be extremely difficult to break through to higher realms in the future.

“She will be heading to the Land of Infinite Demons this time as well,” Elder Xu said.

The cabinet elder nodded lightly. “Although she did waste over ten years, the variant Heavenly Demon Bloodline in her body is still there. Going to the Land of Infinite Demons to train is good too.”

While the cabinet elder felt that it was regretful for that child with potential, he did not ignore the variant Heavenly Demon Bloodline. If there were opportunities, perhaps it could still be reversed.

“Does everyone know that she has a variant Heavenly Demon Bloodline?” The cabinet elder asked.

Elder Xu shook his head. “Only Jiang Liu, the Domain Monarch, and I know about it. We were not told to let others know about this matter.”

“That’s the best. There’s no need to spread this news around before she is powerful enough. The Jiang Family is known as the Domain Monarch’s clan in the First Domain, but many ancient clans secretly refuse to accept it. Since they could have sent people to steal the child away last time, we must be more guarded now,” said the cabinet elder thoughtfully.
