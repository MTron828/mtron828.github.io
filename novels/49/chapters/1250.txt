Chapter 1251: Misspoken Words (1)

The fight disturbed the peace of the celebration. Members of the Yunying Sect left nothing but a mess behind.

Luo Feng took a glimpse at Luo Qufeng and said softly, “Great Grandfather, those people of the Yunying Sect…”

“It’s alright.” Luo Qufeng shook his head.

The moment Luo Qufeng finished his words, a deep burst of laughter was heard.

Two figures appeared in the midair and landed in the courtyard of the Luo Family.

“Brother Luo, sorry that I’m slightly late today. Hope you can understand.” A tall and strong elder with a beard folded his hands together and smiled at Luo Qufeng.

The other skinny and shorter elder folded his hands and greeted Luo Qufeng as well.

The guests were shocked as they saw the sudden appearance of the two elders.

They both were one of the twelve saints of the Central Mainland. The tall one was called Hong Zhong. He was extremely strong and could destroy a mountain or sea with one fist. The shorter one was called Suo Mu. He was very powerful despite being small.

Both of them fought during the fight at the second domain a few thousand years ago. Their help was significant, and they were friends with Luo Qufeng.

The name of the twelve saints was very influential. Everyone was a renowned chief. They could make the Central Mainland tremble with a slight stomp.

Luo Qufeng looked at Suo Mu and Hong Zhong and smiled. “It’s alright, as long as you’re here.”

Hong Zhong laughed and scanned through the mess.

“Brother Luo, today is your birthday. What’s wrong with the celebration…”

Before Hong Zhong finished his words, his sight landed on Ye Qingtang, who was sitting in the mess.

Both Hong Zhong and Suo Mu were part of the fight a few thousand years ago and had seen the Holy Lord of Shadows.

“Holy Lord of Shadows?” Hong Zhong was astonished as he saw Ye Qingtang.

“I did not imagine that Brother Luo was able to invite Holy Lord Senior over as well.”

Hong Zhong folded his hands together and greeted Ye Qingtang. “Senior, I could still remember how you fought a few thousand years ago. It’s my pleasure to be able to meet you here today.”

Suo Mu also went forward and greeted her. “Senior, we were here to celebrate brother Luo’s birthday and did not expect to meet you here.”

Ye Qingtang stared at Hong Zhong and Suo Mu. She was surprised internally.

The position that the twelve saints held in the Central Mainland was supreme. Their power and ability were terrifying for all. Ye Qingtang had only heard of their names in her previous life and met a few. She respected them greatly.

Hong Zhong and Suo Mu, the twelve saints that she respected, greeted her in front of everyone and addressed her as Senior.

Ye Qingtang had mixed feelings but did not reveal any of them on her face. She just smiled and nodded slightly.

Suo Mu and Hong Zhong did not feel anything that was inappropriate.

“The memories of meeting Senior in the past are still fresh in my mind. I need to thank Brother Luo for inviting Senior here and providing us with another opportunity to meet you.” They added.

Ye Qingtang could not say anything and could only remain calm.

Hong Zhong looked towards Luo Qufeng and said, “Brother Luo, if you told us earlier that the Holy Lord of Shadows is going to be here, Suo Mu and I would definitely be punctual.”
