Chapter 2356: Stealing Their Teacher (3)

Lei Yan’s method was indeed rather shameless. The others were secretly scornful but outwardly…

“Little Mo Mo, I think this method might work. You should go ahead and try it.” Hang Wenwei looked very righteous.

“Oh yes, crying alone is not enough. You need to howl, howl until your Master’s heart softens.”

Those brats behaved like armchair experts, throwing the deplorable task onto Ran Mo’s lap. Like this, the pitiful Ran Mo was forced into his mission.

The number one student in the Netherworld Academy threw himself at his Master’s feet and cried the entire night.

Wu Fengling nearly went deaf from the noise. He finally agreed to go speak to Zhu Ning. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The personal intervention of Wu Fengling seemed to work. Zhu Ning stopped his antics and Ye Qing could finally teach her brats in peace.

Having been delayed for several days, Ran Mo and his group gradually started to absorb Ye Qing’s teachings. Meanwhile, Lei Yan and his gang recalled something very crucial.

“I say, Boss… didn’t you make that bet with Di Nuo earlier? If you win, isn’t Di Nuo supposed to crawl out of the Netherworld Academy?” Lei Yan always got angry all over again when he recalled how overbearing Di Nuo was.

Now, their Boss had proved herself in every way. It was time for Di Nuo to carry out the terms of the bet!

“That’s right. Boss, make Di Nuo carry out the terms of the bet.” Nangong Lie piped up.

If not for Di Nuo, so many unpleasant things would not have happened.

Di Nuo thought that he would definitely win and had been so eager to publicly announce the bet between him and Ye Qing. But since that day after Ye Qing thrashed him and he had to be carried away, there had been no news of Di Nuo.

“I think that Di Nuo is still bed-ridden.” Lei Yan rubbed his chin.

“Are you all very bored?” Ye Qing shot them a mild look.

Lei Yan and the others shuddered under Ye Qing’s gaze as he lifted his chin and said, “Yesterday’s technique. Practice it another 10 times.”

“…”

The faces of Lei Yan and the others darkened as they stared at Ye Qing pitifully.

They were just speaking up for Boss, why was he so heartless?

As much as they grumbled, they had no choice but to carry out all extra 10 rounds of practice.

As for the bet between her and Di Nuo, Ye Qingtang had not taken it to heart at all. For someone as proud as Di Nuo, being publicly defeated by Ye Qingtang was enough to shatter all his dignity.

Ye Qingtang had no time to bother about him anymore as she could now go for the Inter-Academy Competition. So she had already decided to spend as much time as she could with her brats until the end of the competition, after which she would leave this mainland and head off to the Dragon Emperor Clan to find her mother.

Instead of wasting her time on inconsequential people, she would rather concentrate on teaching her brats.

Ye Qingtang did not take the matter with Di Nuo to heart at all. But it was true that Di Nuo remained out of sight during this period.

Meanwhile, Ye Qing’s reputation in the Netherworld Academy was flourishing. Nearly all the students knew of this formidable teacher who knew both martial arts and alchemy.

However, Ye Qing was only teaching Lei Yan, Ran Mo and the selected few. This was also Wu Fengling’s intention. After all, the Inter-Academy Competition depended on those top students.
