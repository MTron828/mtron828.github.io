Chapter 2711: Wealthy (2)

After deducting the corresponding cursed points, all the Heaven-level divine weapons in the shop now belonged to Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang immediately went forward and chose a Black Fire Blade.

“You guys can split the rest.”

Ye Qingtang looked at the Great Immortal Temple disciples.

The Heaven-level divine weapons here were really cheap. Ye Qingtang had 300,000 cursed points and not much was deducted even after buying everything.

“Junior Sister Ye Yue, you’re too generous… how can we accept this…”

“I have 300,000 cursed points,” Ye Qingtang said expressionlessly.

Everyone, “…”

In the end, these things were nothing to Ye Qingtang.

Furthermore, their goal in entering this place was to obtain the Paragon Relic. It was very likely that they would encounter disciples from other supreme factions. But if they had divine weapons, what was there to fear?

The group shot Ye Qingtang a look before rushing towards the Heaven-level divine weapons in the shop.

“I wield double knives… I want two!”

“I can conjure up four arms, I want six!”

“Don’t move. My biggest wish is to open a weapons shop!”

Ye Qingtang, “…”

After a while, everyone received their share of the Heaven-level divine weapons until they were satisfied.

“In the ancient city, apart from weapons, there are also divine armors, Dharma treasures, secret tools, array formations, and so on. If you have enough cursed points, don’t miss this good opportunity to purchase them,” the shopkeeper advised.

Hearing that, Lan Shan’s gaze landed on Ye Qingtang and he smiled. “Forget it… Junior Sister, you didn’t come by your cursed points easily… we’re already satisfied.”

Ye Qingtang was deep in thought. Her 300,000 cursed points were really no different from the wind around her.

“Let’s go. I’ll buy them all,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Really?” Zhou Yun asked in surprise.

“Since we entered this place to fight for the Paragon Relic, we will inevitably encounter disciples from other supreme factions. The more Dharma treasures we have, the more helpless they will be against us. Otherwise, if others obtain enough cursed points and kill us instead, it will be a tremendous regret for us,” Ye Qingtang explained.

Realization dawned upon everyone.

“Yes, yes, yes. Junior Sister Ye Yue is indeed the wisest and has thought of everything. If not, when the time comes, all of us will be wiped out because of the fight for the Paragon relic. That would be such a waste!” Lan Shan said. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Soon, Ye Qingtang brought everyone around the ancient city and bought all the treasures that they could.

Ye Qingtang then looked at her cursed points.

290,000 left…

It was not just that the items were cheap, but according to the skeleton shopkeeper, this was a low-tier ancient city. Moreover, a Heaven-level divine weapon was considered very ordinary in the Fourth Domain, so the price was low.

If they went to a top-tier ancient city, the items sold would probably all be considered supreme divine items. The prices would definitely not be low then.

Currently, every single person from the Great Immortal Temple was wearing divine armor with astonishing defense. They were able to withstand at least one attack from an Immortal Emperor. Apart from that, each of them had at least one Heaven-level divine weapon and an extremely powerful Dharma treasure.

For example, Lan Shan had bought a seven-story Soul-destroying Pagoda that could imprison an ultimate expert and refine it into spiritual energy.

Meanwhile, Ye Qingtang had chosen a Soul-Bewitching Bell. When struck, its power was astonishing.

Just as everyone was feeling very satisfied, Xie Jun returned.

“Xie Jun, how is it?” Lan Shan asked when he saw Xie Jun.
