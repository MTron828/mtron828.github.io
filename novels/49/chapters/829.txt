Chapter 830 Mysterious Youth

Similar to the little white tiger’s race, the True Dragon and Divine Phoenix were top Fiendcelestial Beasts and the supreme among the Fiendcelestial Beasts.

Even if the battle between the True Dragon and Divine Phoenix lasted for millions of years, there might not be a conclusion. Furthermore, the True Dragon’s bodily strength was the most powerful out of all Fiendcelestial Beasts, and no one could compare to it-probably not even a deity.

How would a True Dragon die so easily like this?

“There are at least seven to eight mainlands of different sizes in the periphery of this mainland. However, the martial culture of this mainland is the most backward and still too weak compared to the surrounding mainlands. Brother Ye Chen, do you know why?” Master Du asked with a smile.

“It seems that it’s because the spirit energy is insufficient.” Ye Qingtang replied.

In her previous life, after she left the mainland, she headed to other mainlands but discovered that the spirit energy in any other mainland was at least a few times more than in this mainland.

For this mainland, Yin Yang Perfected Lord was the maximum, and the number of Yin Yang Perfected Lords could be counted with one hand.

However, even Arcane Supremacies appeared on other mainlands.

Only after breaking through the bottleneck at Yin Yang Perfected Lord Tenth Heaven would one have a slim chance of attempting to advance to an Arcane Supremacy.

However, Yin Yang Perfected Lord Tenth Heaven was extremely rare. Not mentioning this domain, there were only a few even in the Second Domain and Third Domain.

It was said that a cultivator could attempt to advance to the Arcane Supremacy realm after reaching the Yin Yang Perfected Lord Eighth Heaven. Yin Yang Perfected Lord Ninth Heaven was already very rare, and Yin Yang Perfected Lord Tenth Heaven seemed to have already become a lost realm.

In Ye Qingtang’s previous life, she had never reached the threshold of a Yin Yang Perfected Lord Ninth Heaven, much less a Yin Yang Perfected Lord Tenth Heaven, as she merely chose to advance to the Arcane Supremacy realm when she reached the Yin Yang Perfected Lord Eighth Heaven.

Nevertheless, there was never an Arcane Supremacy on this mainland before.

Master Du spoke a long time later. “The spirit energy on this mainland is so thin is because of this Dragon Vein. Rumors have it that the True Dragon’s skeletal remains absorbed about eighty to ninety percent of the spirit energy into this Dragon Vein. The reason why the Peerless School, Phantom Valley, and Beiming Manor can be above the rest and become the most powerful is that they dominated the Dragon Vein.”

“I see.” Ye Qingtang was in thought after hearing Master Du’s explanation, and her interest in the Dragon Vein was finally piqued.

The legend of the True Dragon and Divine Phoenix, the absorption of spirit energy by the True Dragon’s skeletal remains, and even… the treasures in the Dragon Vein…

This trip was equivalent to declaring to the world that the authority of the three top forces on this mainland-Peerless School, Beiming Manor, and Phantom Valley-would eventually be demolished by a person.

In this world, anything could be broken.

If one lived fervently, even the oldest shackles and conventional rules would no longer bind them at all.

Ye Qingtang never thought about her life or death in this trip to the Dragon Vein; she only had one goal.

Step over those three best forces and plunder everything to become a Yin Yang Perfected Lord without impediment.

However, thousands of miles away at this instant.

A male youth was seated beside a mountain spring and playing a game of chess with a white-haired elderly.

This youth was extremely handsome, and it was as though he walked out of a painting, yet there was a trace of an inexplicable devilish charm from his appearance.

“Teacher, I won.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Then, the elderly chuckled, and his hands left the chessboard.
