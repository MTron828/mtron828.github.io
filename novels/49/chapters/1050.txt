Chapter 1051 Beiming Manor (2)

Ye Qingtang looked at the Yunxiao Sect Sect Master rather impatiently. Without saying much, Yang Lord aura surged out, and the Yunxiao Sect Sect Master’s body exploded into innumerable pieces of flesh before everyone’s eyes.

The Yunxiao Sect Sect Master’s skills were not as powerful as that of the Yunxiao Sect Grand Elder; thus, he was unable to withstand Ye Qingtang’s aura suppression.

Witnessing the tragic death of the YunXiao Sect Sect Master, the YunXiao Sect masses paled and gasped.

Without giving them time to return to their senses, Ye Qingtang moved her wrist and twisted the Yunxiao Sect Grand Elder’s neck.

In no time, Yunxiao Sect Sect Master and Grand Elder were both killed by Ye Qingtang.

“Run!”

The Yunxiao Sect Great Elder shouted at the top of his lungs when he noticed that the situation was bad and immediately fled towards the interior of Yunxiao Sect.

Yunxiao Sect’s foundation was extremely powerful, and as long as they could flee back into Yunxiao Sect, it was difficult to annihilate Yunxiao Sect even if Ye Qingtang was a Yang Lord.

If Yunxiao Sect Sect Master and Grand Elder knew that Ye Qingtang was a Yang Lord, they would definitely not step out of Yunxiao Sect…

“Where are you all running to?”

Ye Qingtang shouted coldly, and her Yang Lord aura swept across the entire place, killing the Yunxiao Sect Great Elder instantly.

As the Yunxiao Sect Great Elder was also killed by Ye Qingtang, Yunxiao Sect became completely disunited, and the remaining elders and wardens remained rooted to the ground, shivering, without daring to move an inch.

As long as Ye Qingtang was willing, all of them would be killed by her before they could even make it back into Yunxiao Sect.

If YunXiao Sect Grand Elder and Sect Master countered this battle within the sect, they definitely would not have died so quickly given Yunxiao Sect’s foundation.

Seeing that Yunxiao Sect Grand Elder died from the impact of Ye Qingtang’s Yang Lord aura, Elder Bai Kui finally felt that he had finally avenged his wife.

It was just a pity that he was not the one who personally killed the Yunxiao Sect Grand Elder…

“From now on, Yunxiao Sect no longer exists and will be annexed by the Ye Family. Anyone who resists will be killed. If sect disciples wish to leave, don’t stop them!” Daoist Zijin announced loudly a moment later.

Whether it was a war between sects or family clans, the defeated party must pay a terrible price, and even a foundation that had been passed down for thousands of years would belong to the victor. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Currently, YunXiao Sect Grand Elder, Sect Master, and Great Elder were all dead, and Yunxiao Sect had no leader. It was impossible for them to battle with the Ye Family, which had a Yang Lord. From then on, YunXiao Sect would belong to the Ye Family.

“Yes!” The several Branch Masters and talented disciples immediately responded.

At this instant, the Grand Elders of Yuehua Sect and Lingyun Sect had not left and were hiding above the clouds to observe the situation.

However, when they saw the YunXiao Sect Grand Elder and Sect Master being slain by that Yang Lord in an instant, their backs were drenched with cold sweat.

It was fortunate that they made the right judgment, or else their outcome would be no different from Yunxiao Sect…

“The envoy from Beiming Manor is still within Yunxiao Sect… Yunxiao Sect is an affiliate of Beiming Manor. I’m afraid… the Beiming Manor will not leave this matter alone…” The Yuehua Sect Grand Elder looked at the Lingyun Sect Grand Elder beside him.

“The Ye Family only has one Yang Lord. How can it contend against Beiming Manor, which is one of the three mighty forces of this mainland? There will be a good show to watch now!”

The Lingyun Grand Elder nodded.
