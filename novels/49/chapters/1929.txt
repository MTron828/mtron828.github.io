Chapter 1930: The Return (3)

Ye Qingtang led the group of ancient clan people after Ming Di, with the eight tribe leaders and the rest following after them as well.

The effeminate-looking youth was desecrating everything in his path outside the Temple of Shadows. The horde of Undead Clan soldiers barely lifted a hand before they were all annihilated like sacks of rotting meat. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Xue Fu approached first. Knowing full well the strength of the youth, he didn’t rush forward and instead looked solemnly at the arrogant boy in front of him.

“Ask your Holy Lord to come out. I didn’t get to fight her properly the last time and I want to test her strength properly today.” The effeminate-looking youth raised his brows and demanded of Xue Fu.

Xue Fu’s face darkened and he laughed coldly. “Who do you think you are? Weren’t you the one who was too afraid to fight our Holy Lord that day and ran away with your tail in between your legs? Are you here to seek your own death today?”

The blatant insult seemed to hit a nerve, and the effeminate-looking youth narrowed his eyes as his gaze brushed past the cold young man behind him. Seeing that he was expressionless with his hands crossed around his chest, he declared, “I had something else I had to deal with that day. Who said I ran? Is your Holy Lord too scared to face me today?”

Just as Xue Fu was about to retort sarcastically, a huge black shadow rushed out from within the Temple of Shadows.

Xue Fu couldn’t help but feel delighted to see that figure.

“Where did this little brat come from? How dare he speak such big words in front of my Temple of Shadows?” With a flourish of wings, Ming Di landed in front of Xue Fu, his red eyes scanning the ground filled with soldiers from the Undead Clan.

“And who are you? I have no interest in wasting my time on you. Get the Holy Lord to come out right now.” The effeminate-looking youth looked impatiently at the dragon in front of him.

The only person he was concerned about in the entire Temple of Shadows was the Temple of Shadows, but he had nothing to fear since his senior brother was here today.

Ming Di’s eyes flashed. Seeing how the boy in front of it didn’t recognize it at all, it was suddenly reminded that it had been sealed for over ten thousand years.

At this moment, Ye Qingtang had also arrived with the others in tow.

“This little brat dared to return?” Little White Tiger muttered as it saw the youth once again killing everything in his path.

Ye Qingtang didn’t rush to speak and instead looked at the youth and the stranger behind him.

The man was a cold and handsome young man. Compared to the effeminate-looking youth, he seemed much calmer. But their clothes were similar and Ye Qingtang guessed that he had probably been called to assist.

No wonder the little rascal had dared to come back so quickly.

He had found someone to help him.

“Holy Lord of Shadows, I was caught up in something else the other day but let’s have a proper battle today. Hand over what I want if you lose,” the effeminate-looking youth demanded again.

The reactions of eight tribe leaders as they saw the arrogant youth were vastly different from the reactions of the ancient clan leaders.

“What did this little brat come from? How dare he impersonate the Holy Lord? He’s probably sick of living.” A cold laugh ripped out from the Demon Tribe Leader’s lips.

“And who are you? I was talking to the Holy Lord of Shadows. You have no right to speak here,” the effeminate-looking youth said.

The Demon Tribe Leader had never been treated with such ridicule before. As one of the eight tribe leaders, everyone treated him with the utmost respect.

It was time to teach the brat a lesson.

With one great leap, the Demon Tribe Leader rushed towards the effeminate-looking youth.
