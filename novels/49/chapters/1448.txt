Chapter 1449 Protecting One“s Child 3

The expression of everyone present flickered. Jiang Yiming and the others bowed their heads silently. They looked embarrassed and anxious.

Jiang Liu had not expected the truth to be like that.

Jiang Yiming and the others had really deliberately provoked Ye Qingtang and tried to make trouble for her.

But he had fully believed Jiang Yiming and repeatedly asked Ye Qingtang to apologize to him.

Even though he was biased, Jiang Liu could not help but feel embarrassed.

“Ah… Is this how the Jiang Family does things? My daughter has just returned to the Jiang Family, and you bully her like that.” Mo Yi laughed in rage. A cold light shone in her eyes.

They could tell from the scenes conjured by the Memory Pearl that if Ye Qingtang had not been alert and resourceful, she would have been killed by their combined attack.

“Mo Yi, after all, Ye Qingtang was not injured. Jiang Yiming and the others may have overstepped the boundaries a little, but it is true that Ye Qingtang suddenly attacked and injured someone. According to our family rules, she should still be punished.” Elder Meng did not change tack even after he saw everything.

“In the scenes just now, Ye Qingtang really attacked someone suddenly and injured him, just as Jiang Yiming and the others said. Is there anything wrong with that?”

Ye Qingtang was impressed by how he could take things out of context.

This Elder Meng really hated her.

“Elder Meng, what have I done wrong? Jiang Yiming volunteered to fight me one-on-one. What’s the matter? Am I not allowed to fight?” Ye Qingtang laughed coldly.

“Although it was a one-on-one fight, you attacked before the match started. You were not abiding by the rules.” Elder Meng doggedly held on to this point and refused to let go.

Ye Qingtang suddenly laughed loudly.

“Elder Meng, are you deaf? Just now, the Memory Pearl clearly recorded that Jiang Yiming volunteered to let me go first, so of course, I struck the first blow. I only did so with his agreement. Who knew that he could still spout so much nonsense?”

Ye Qingtang’s argument was watertight. Elder Meng’s expression immediately darkened.

The truth was that Jiang Yiming had agreed to let her go first before she attacked. Based on this reasoning, Ye Qingtang’s sudden strike was not a covert attack but the start of the match.

Jiang Yiming had no grounds for complaint after he was kicked.

Elder Meng had repeatedly insisted on her guilt, but Ye Qingtang had easily refuted him. Now, his expression turned ugly.

Jiang Yiming was angry and annoyed. He had not expected Ye Qingtang to be so cunning.

Mo Yi suddenly laughed at the scene before her.

“You are truly worthy to be my daughter. You’re not so easily bullied.” Mo Yi looked at Ye Qingtang dotingly.

Even if Ye Qingtang was in the wrong, Mo Yi would not allow her to be harmed, much less if she was in the right.

With that, she looked up, and her gaze swept across everyone present. Her look was wintry and merciless.

“We have clearly established what happened today. In the future, if anyone dares to use this matter to make things difficult for Tang Tang, I will reduce them to ashes.”Jiang Yiming and the others were so frightened by Mo Yi’s gaze that they started to quiver all over.

Her words were clearly a warning to them.

“Tang Tang was clearly the victim here. They bullied her. Based on the Jiang Family rules, they should be punished.” Mo Yi’s half-hooded eyes looked straight at Elder Meng, who kept trying to pronounce Ye Qingtang’s guilt.

They had bullied her daughter. How could they be let off so easily?

“She’s not injured at all. What did we do wrong?” Jiang Yiming immediately protested when he heard that he was to be punished.

Mo Yi laughed coldly. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Elder Meng said solemnly, “She brought it on herself because of her bad character. Ye Qingtang must have conducted herself improperly, as they would not have provoked her for no reason. Ultimately, she is the one who caused all this trouble after she entered the Jiang Family, so she is still at fault.”
