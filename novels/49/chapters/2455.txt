Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

At that moment, Ye Qingtang still had a lingering fear from her earlier experience and if given a choice, she never wanted to return to that place again. If she was unlucky and fell into a group of demons, wouldn’t she be skinned alive?

“Teacher Ye Qing?”

Lu Yuanxiang could not help calling out when he saw that Ye Qing kept hesitating to speak.

Finally collecting herself, Ye Qingtang said, “I believe everyone saw that I do have a way to leave this place.”

The expressions of Lu Yuanxiang and the Flying Star Academy teacher changed drastically as indescribable excitement filled their eyes.

“Teacher Ye Qing, are you serious?!” Lu Yuanxiang asked anxiously.

Ye Qingtang nodded slightly. “Of course. I can bring everyone out of here.”

“Good, good. Then… Teacher Ye Qing, there’s no time to lose. Let’s hurry out!” The Flying Star Academy teacher was overjoyed.

Lu Yuanxiang and the Flying Star Academy teacher were not the only ones. Qin Feng, Mu Ziying, and the other students were also excited.

Initially, they thought they would die in this godforsaken place. Never did they expect their Boss to suddenly appear and bring them out of this desperate situation.

However, Ye Qing’s next sentence was like a splash of cold water on everyone.

“But let me clarify something. I have a way to leave the palace but it’s not safe. Perhaps… the way to leave might be even more terrifying than being stuck here,” Ye Qingtang said with a frown.

Ye Qingtang was referring to the entire Wailing Well region when she said “here”.

“Teacher Ye Qing… What exactly do you mean? I don’t understand.” Lu Yuanxiang was confused.

“Since that’s the case, I won’t hide it anymore.” Ye Qingtang decided to lie. She could not tell everyone the truth. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Have you all heard of the Space Technique?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Of course, but I’ve only heard of it. Legend has it that the supreme being from the Temple of Paragon knows the Space Technique.” The Flying Star Academy teacher nodded.

Lu Yuanxiang seemed to have understood the meaning of Ye Qing’s words and looked at her in disbelief. “Teacher Ye Qing… are you… are you saying that you know the Space Technique?”

Ye Qingtang smiled at this. “I’m not considered proficient. I’ve done some research and know a little about it.”

Lu Yuanxiang was not the only one. Everyone at present was stunned by Ye Qing’s admission.

Space Technique…

It was a god-level concept!

They had never witnessed any divine techniques like the Space Technique before.

Nangong Lie saw that the faces of Mu Ziying, Qin Feng and the others had remained unchanged. He asked in surprise, “Aren’t you guys shocked?”

Qin Feng and Mu Ziying shook their heads in unison.

Nangong Lie smiled. Indeed, ever since their Boss appeared in their lives, had there been any incident that had not shocked them? Even if he really did know the legendary Space Technique, it felt like… it was no big deal.

“But, Teacher Ye Qing, is there any danger to the Space Technique?” Lu Yuanxiang asked with a frown.

“I said earlier that I’m not proficient in the Space Technique. I just know a little about it. The space realm is always changing and I can’t control it completely. Perhaps the Space Technique will bring us to a completely new and unfamiliar world…” Ye Qing continued.

The big yellow dog glanced at Ye Qingtang. It didn’t know that this human’s deception skills were so high-level. If it did not know the real truth, it would have been deceived by her too..
