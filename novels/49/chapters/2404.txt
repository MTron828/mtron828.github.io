Chapter 2405: Tragic (2)

The eyes of the teenagers instantly turned red at his question.

“Teacher, Xu Yue… Xu Yue… he’s gone…” The teenager choked out the words. He would never forget the sight of his teammate being torn apart by that monster.

Xu Yue’s living body had been torn apart just like that…

The teacher took a deep breath. Visibly struggling, he took off his space ring and handed it to the teenager beside him.

“Share the elixirs inside with everyone.”

Apart from a tripod, over a dozen demon crystals and the teleportation talisman, there was only one bottle of elixir inside the space ring.

Xu Yue was the only medicine faculty student in their team. He had hurriedly refined this bottle of elixir during a rare period of rest.

And now, there were only five pills left inside that bottle…

Everyone in the team had sustained grave injuries, and the elixirs were only basic healing pills. They were completely inadequate to treat their critical conditions.

“Teacher, hurry up and take the medicine…” One of the teenagers wiped his tears before holding up all five elixirs to the teacher’s lips.

Their teacher would not have suffered such fatal injuries if he hadn’t tried to save them.

“There are only… so few…” The teacher looked at the pitiful number of elixirs. His face grew increasingly grim as he shook his head.

“My injuries are too grave. This medicine is useless to me. Go and give them to those who have suffered the most serious injuries. Then… crush the teleportation talisman…” The teacher closed his eyes after uttering those final words.

He would never have chosen to activate the teleportation talisman if not for their dire straits. Once activated, this meant they would be disqualified from the competition.

Their life-and-death struggle, the sacrifice of one of their students. It had all been for nothing.

The teenagers surrounded their teacher, all weeping uncontrollably. They had fought with every ounce of their strength and will, only to end up with such an outcome.

Just as they were engulfed by their sorrow, a figure flashed across their heads.

Within seconds, those teenagers instinctively gripped their weapons and looked at the figure who had just appeared.

“Who’s there!” The teacher gave a low shout. He forced himself to stand up so that he could protect his students.

But seeing the uniform on the newcomer, he heaved a sigh of relief.

It was the Netherworld Academy uniform!

“Ye Qing?” The teacher immediately recognized the youth standing before him.

It was that young punk Ye Qing, right?

The teenagers who had all gone on high alert instantly relaxed on seeing that it was Ye Qing. Seeing that their teacher had exposed himself, Lei Yan and the others also jumped off their perches.

Ye Qingtang looked at the wretched state of the other team and couldn’t help frowning slightly. The teacher was called Lu Yuanxiang and she knew of him even from before the competition. His cultivation level was comparable to hers and he was a highly-respected teacher. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The demons here were challenging but not so formidable as to be able to inflict such grave injuries on a Divine Lord Fifth Heaven level practitioner. Moreover, amongst the Netherworld Academy teams, Lu Yuanxiang’s team was only second to hers. His team had students who were ranked just below hers.

What the hell had happened that resulted in Lu Yuanxiang and his team being so seriously injured?

Ye Qingtang was full of questions. Even so, she knew that this was not the right time to ponder them.
