Chapter 291: Torn Skin and Flesh (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

There were many discussions among the disciples, and the warden’s expression turned solemn as well.

If Lu Xiuwen really harmed Yun Shu, his offense would be serious, but using this sword as evidence was not sufficient.

Ye Qingtang took in everyone’s expression quietly, and her lips curled into a smile. She walked forward and said, “I think what Senior Brother Lu said should be real.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Ye Qingtang’s words surprised everyone

What was going on?

Ye Qingtang actually spoke up for Lu Xiuwen?

Lu Xiuwen was a little surprised as well, completely not understanding what Ye Qingtang was planning to do.

Ye Qingtang smiled. “I believe that given Senior Brother Lu’s character, he would not do such a despicable thing. If he really did it, wouldn’t it bring shame to the entire Formidable Heavens Royals? Someone who could do such a lowly thing that’s worse than pigs or dogs is definitely a scoundrel.”

Although Ye Qingtang’s words were helping Lu Xiuwen, they sounded piercing to him.

Despicable?

Bring shame to the Formidable Heavens Royals?

Worse than pigs or dogs?

If not for the fact that it was unsuitable to argue right now, Lu Xiuwen really wanted to rip Ye Qingtang’s mouth apart. That scumbag was simply using this opportunity to criticize him.

Yet, even if he knew that, Lu Xiuwen could only suffer in silence!

“Senior Brother Lu previously said that he did not lose this sword, and given Senior Brother Yun’s character, I believe that he will not malign a fellow disciple. Thus… it is very possible that someone wanted to sow discord. After stealing Senior Brother Lu’s sword, the person pretended to be Senior Brother Lu, deliberately tricked Senior Brother Yun, and took the chance to attack him. Ultimately, Senior Brother Lu should be innocent.” Ye Qingtang behaved contrary to her usual attitude towards Lu Xiuwen as she helped Lu Xiuwen to prove his innocence, which was beyond everyone’s expectations.

Lu Xiuwen, whose face was pale, was also worried that he would be accountable for the matter regarding the sword and could only go along with Ye Qingtang. “What Junior Sister Ye said is definitely the case. There must be some bastard who deliberately sowed discord between Junior Brother Yun and me by pretending to be me and injuring Junior Brother Yun. This sword must have been stolen by that bastard.”

The warden frowned and nodded after thinking that it made sense.

Who knew…

However, Ye Qingtang suddenly added on. “Although Senior Brother Lu is not really related to this incident, it was his sword that hurt Senior Brother Yun. He did not keep an eye on his items well and let others have a chance to steal it. If others did not pretend to be Senior Brother Lu, Senior Brother Yun would not have fallen for it so easily. So… although Senior Brother Lu is not the murderer, he is still responsible for the crime.”

Lu Xiuwen was shocked, and he glared at Ye Qingtang instantly.

Everything she said previously was for this moment!

Although he knew that he fell for Ye Qingtang’s scheme, things had already reached this point, and Lu Xiuwen could only clench his teeth. “Indeed. It is all because of me that Junior Brother Yun suffered such a disaster. I am willing to be punished.”

The warden said, “Lu Xiuwen did not safe keep his items well and caused his weapon to fall in other’s hands. Although you did not personally injure Yun Shu, he was attacked using your weapon. You’re exempted from the death penalty but not from punishment. You are to be flogged fifty strokes. This small punishment will stop you from making even bigger mistakes in the future. As fellow disciples in the same sect, you all should support each other and not let outsiders have a chance to exploit any of your flaws.”

Once the warden finished his sentence, Lu Xiuwen’s face turned miserably pale immediately.

Fifty strokes of flogging, that could tear one’s skin and flesh!

However, up to that point, he could only clench his teeth and swallow this ill consequence!
