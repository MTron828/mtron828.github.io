Was this possible? Could Han Cangming and the Heavenly Emperor’s ascend to heaven have something to do with the big yellow dog’s upper realm?

A scene appeared in Ye Qingtang’s mind.

One day, the Heavenly Emperor had received a stone of opportunity and was able to ascend to heaven, which was the upper realm the big yellow dog was talking about. But this important stone that the Heavenly Emperor required to ascend to heaven was stolen by Han Cangming. From then on, their mutual love for each other turned into murderous intent and the two friends became arch enemies…

Ye Qingtang rested her chin on her hand as many thoughts filled her head. The more she thought about it, the more she felt it was possible.

After all, the ones who didn’t know about the upper realm were martial arts practitioners like them. Perhaps the Paragon level Immortal Emperors already knew about the existence of the upper realm and even knew how to enter it.

Of course, these were merely her conjectures. As for whether they were true, there was no way to know. The only way to find out was to ask Han Cangming and the Heavenly Emperor.

“After that, the Heavenly Emperor’s opportunistic item was taken by Han Cangming, and later on, he vanished for a long time and was an emperor the next time he appeared again,” the Feng Family Patriarch said.

“Wow…” Ye Qingtang looked at Han Cangming who was smiling coldly in the sky.

This Demon God had stolen his good friend’s important item and caused them to become arch enemies because of it…. in her eyes, Demon God Han Cangming didn’t seem like someone strong enough to do that.

Even Ye Qingtang who was stronger wouldn’t have been able to do something like this to someone unless they were an enemy. If it was a friend, she would never be able to betray them like this.

“Of course, this is just what I’ve heard from others, so… Lady Ye, you can’t spread this around,” the Feng Family patriarch reminded her softly.

Hearing this, Ye Qingtang nodded profusely.

She was not dumb after all. If this was to get out, it would definitely affect Han Cangmings reputation. If he were to ever find out that she was the one who spread the information, he would definitely kill her.

High above in the sky, the Heavenly Emperor looked at Han Cangming and said coldly, “Since that’s the case, let’s fight.”

As soon as the words were out of his mouth, he started moving forwards slowly. The sky changed color with every step that he took. Countless bolts of purple lightning flashed across the sky like dragons as thunderous booms shook the sky.

At this moment, the sky darkened as the lighting and thunder continued across it and the earth below shook. Just a tiny movement from the Heavenly Emperor was enough to evoke such a great momentum that shook the earth.

“This…”

The scene in front of Ye Qingtang made her pupils constrict.

What power!

This was the first time she was witnessing people of the Immortal Emperor fighting. In her previous life and this, she had never been lucky enough to witness such a great exchange of power before! Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

She was stunned beyond words.

Take the Fengyun family for example. They had tens of thousands of Emperor level practitioners. Yet the Heavenly Emperor would only require one breath to destroy them all.

“Is this… The power close to god…” Ye Qingtang murmured as she looked at the changing colors of the sky.

That cheap brother of hers… was so powerful….
