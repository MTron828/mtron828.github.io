The buddha in the temple chuckled. “You are born with sin.”

Ye Qingtang frowned and did not bother to say anything, She slashed the temple with her Demonic Blood Sword.

Boom!

A loud sound exploded, and a cloud of dust was spinning in the wind.

The temple was crushed into pieces under her sword.

“That was risky…”

Ye Qingtang’s face was pale, and she could still feel the fear in her heart.

Just now, she was deluded by the voice from the temple. She was filled with regret and sadness that led to the development of mental demons. She thought that she was full of sin and wanted to end her own life.

However…

Ye Qingtang toucher her glabella area.

The blood moon had disappeared, and the power inside it was used up.

“There is brother’s power in the blood moon mark…” Ye Qingtang was in thought.

The shadow that appeared from her glabella was the remaining consciousness of the Blood Moon Holy Lord. If it had not appeared, she would have died.

“Such a pity…” Ye Qingtang shook her head as the remaining power in the blood moon was used up. If she encountered any danger in the future, the blood moon would not be able to help her anymore.

Soon, Ye Qingtang cleared her thoughts and sized up the debris of the temple.

The power inside the temple was able to delude people nearby. They would definitely be influenced by the stone buddha. Without a strong mental ability, they would definitely die here miserably.

However, Ye Qingtang did not have any mental demons as she did not do anything harmful in her entire life. She was firm on that deep in her heart, and that was the reason why she dared to challenge that her life and her birth was not full of sin.

The query she had in her heart stimulated the remaining consciousness that was sealed in the blood moon. She then abandoned her confusion and got rid of the mental demons. The temple was destroyed under her sword.

The Blood Moon Elder woke up after a while. He stared at Ye Qingtang in confusion as he did not know what happened.

“How come I feel that… I was hit by someone…” The Blood Moon Elder murmured, and his eyes were filled with uncertainty.

Ye Qingtang did not explain but walked to the debris of the temple. She picked up a crystal from the broken buddha.

“Illusion stone…”

Ye Qingtang sized up the crystal in her hand. Her face was very serious.

The illusion stone was the pupil of a demonic beast that had enchantment skills. It would never grow in a stone buddha.

Ye Qingtang noticed earlier that the buddha’s left eye was weird.

The buddha’s left eye was placed with the illusion stone by someone. Once a person’s eyes met with the stone, the person would be deluded. The illusion stone was the culprit behind the actions of those who committed suicide earlier.

“Is it possible that…” Ye Qingtang was puzzled.?All these are man-made?

The Hundred Level Peril Hell of Avicinaraka was made by humans… How could that be possible? Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Furthermore, mystic realms opened by chance and had a hundred different levels of danger. No one could predict the opening of the Hell of Avicinaraka. Even gods might not be able to do that…

Ye Qingtang was slightly irritated and waved towards the Blood Moon Elder nearby.

The Blood Moon Elder ran towards her immediately.

Ye Qingtang did not hide anything. She showed the illusion stone to the Blood Moon Elder and told him her opinion.
