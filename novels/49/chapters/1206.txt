1207 Blood Battle 9

However, when the moment arrived, he did not know the reason why he could not control himself and saved her eventually.

The illusion world that Ye Qingtang was in collapsed as You Tong was heavily injured.

Ye Qingtang opened her eyes slowly, and a familiar but cold face appeared in front of her.

“Blood Moon… Bro… Brother?” Ye Qingtang frowned slightly as she stared at the Blood Moon Holy Lord.

Though she was stuck in the illusion world, she could sense what was going on in the outside world. If the Blood Moon Holy Lord did not save her just now, she would be dead under You Tong’s sword.

“You… Since you want to kill me, why… did you save me?” Ye Qingtang looked at the Blood Moon Holy Lord and asked.

However, the Blood Moon Holy Lord just stood there without any response. Some traces of complexity appeared in his emotionless eyes.

Just as she had said, why did he save her… Even if that would cost him his body…

“I will kill you.. but, you can only die in my hands.” After a while, the Blood Moon Holy Lord looked at Ye Qingtang and said.

“Are you satisfied with the answer?” He asked.

“Why do you want to kill me?” Ye Qingtang could never understand that.

Before the Blood Moon Holy Lord could say anything, You Tong shouted. “Kill them!”

As You Tong finished his words, the remaining figures of the Ancient You Clan dashed towards the Blood Moon Holy Lord.

The Blood Moon Holy Lord raised his right arm and waved his right hand downward.

Moon Extermination!

A blood moon at the Blood Moon Holy Lord’s glabella rotated slowly.

The next second, under Ye Qingtang’s surprised gaze, the few hundred figures of the Ancient You Clan were torn into pieces and disappeared like dust.

Puff…

After killing hundreds with one hand, the Blood Moon Holy Lord’s face was pale, and a mouthful of blood spurted from his mouth. He stumbled and was about to fall.

Ye Qingtang immediately went forward and held the Blood Moon Holy Lord. “Brother… How’s your injury?”

The Blood Moon Holy Lord felt the warmth from Ye Qingtang. He frowned slightly and asked, “Are you caring for me?”

“Of course! Though I don’t know why you want to kill me… But, you’re my brother. We pledged under the sky before,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Is it…” The Blood Moon Holy Lord took a complex glimpse at Ye Qingtang. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Holy fiend extermination eye!”

You Tong suddenly shouted. His eyes rotated madly. A Godfiend shadow appeared from the eyes.

“I don’t care who you are. Today, you will die here! This is a forbidden skill that runs with my life. You shall have a taste of that!” You Tong looked at the Blood Moon Holy Lord in rage.

“Back off.”

The Blood Moon Holy Lord pushed gently, but Ye Qingtang moved back around ten meters from the little push.

As Ye Qingtang moved back, a fog made of blood surrounded the Blood Moon Holy Lord and You Tong immediately.

Around fifteen minutes later, the fog faded.

You Tong had become a pool of blood. The Blood Moon Holy Lord fell onto the ground with his clothes torn.

He stared at the stars quietly with his indifferent eyes.

Ye Qingtang’s expression changed, and she ran over to the Blood Moon Holy Lord, trying to help him up.

However, Ye Qingtang’s hands went through his body, as if there was nothing there…

“This…”

Ye Qingtang looked at the Blood Moon Holy Lord in shock.
