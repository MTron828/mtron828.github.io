Chapter 2504: Underground Demon God (14)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The elder’s expression changed at once. He knew that this lord had just been awoken and the actions were likely subconscious. But why was he so unlucky?

“Lord… My lord… us lowly elders were tasked with reviving you. Please have mercy!” Realizing that there was no escape, the elder started shouting at the top of his lungs in despair.

But it was only one arm piercing through the ground, so how could it possibly hear anything?

Without giving the old man any more chances to speak, the giant hand slowly clenched. In an instant, the old man was crushed into a pool of blood that oozed out of its fingers.

The situation made the elders above the void frown. A few elders quickly retreated, afraid of being caught by the grasping hands.

Swoosh!

At the same time, a huge hand grabbed at Ye Qingtang and the others like a lively python.

“Oh my god!”

Seeing this, the Blood Moon Elder was stunned. What was this demon? It was too terrifying!

The elder from before was just slightly stronger than the Holy Lady by about one level, but the demon palm had crushed in so effortlessly in an instant. If that elder couldn’t even resist and was as weak as a little kid in front of the demon, there was no way the Holy Lady and he would be able to survive.

“Holy Lady, please run. I will hold this beast back!” the Blood Moon Elder said hurriedly as he turned to look at Ye Qingtang.

A deep frown was on her face. Even though the demon palm was moving extremely quickly, there was still some distance between them. She knew what would happen if they were to be wrapped in the demon’s palm. Like the elder before them, there was no way they would survive.

It was attacking its own people, let alone her, the Blood Moon Elder and a dog…

She took a deep breath and a dark look filled her eyes.

She didn’t want to die in this godforsaken place.

Seeing the demon palm approaching quicker and quicker, Ye Qingtang’s face darkened. After pondering for a moment, she concluded that there was no way to deal with the demon palm. She could only make contact with the Deity Ocean within her again and enter the Deity Ocean space. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

She was feeling extremely helpless. She had never imagined that she would have to enter the Deity Ocean space again just after leaving it.

But she had no choice if she wanted to live. After all, the demon palm was too terrifying and this was her only option.

“Holy Lady, please run!” the Blood Moon Elder shouted as he saw her standing still without moving.

Did she not see how terrifying the demon palm was?

Ye Qingtang looked at Blood Moon Elder and took a deep breath. Grabbing the big yellow dog with both hands, she placed her left hand on the Blood Moon Elder’s shoulder.

“You’re always carrying me like this. It’s so embarrassing for me,” the big yellow dog said unhappily.

Ye Qingtang had no intention of arguing with it at such a time. It would be great if they could get out of this place alive. Who cares whether it was embarrassing!

She quickly contacted the Deity Ocean within herself and prepared to enter the space.

“Holy… do you plan on having all of us die here?” The Blood Moon Elder couldn’t understand what she was doing.

“Die together? No thank you, put me down first. We can talk things out.. It’s fine if you die but I’m just a dog! Please don’t bring me along with you, there’s still hope for me!” the big yellow dog quickly said.
