Chapter 1088 Is It A Pity? (3)

Divine King Luo Xue called out to You Yun, but that lady who had been imprinted in his heart for ten thousand years did not respond; she was so near yet so far.

“Hahaha. Divine King Luo Xue! I already thought that you were harboring evil designs back then… In the end, you really betrayed us. You deserve it!”

Just when Divine King Luo Xue fixed his gaze on You Yun, several elderlies walked out of the gold carriage and floated in the air.

Divine King Luo Xue looked in the direction of the voice and saw those ancient clan powerful figures. His face turned extremely cold in an instant, and overpowering martial willpower rushed into the horizon.

“Ha. If you swallowed that dumb woman’s heart from the start, you could have been free from the curse, went to the outside world, and still be that Divine King Luo Xue. Yet, look at you now. What are you?!”

A white-haired elderly stared at Divine King Luo Xue and scoffed.

This elderly similarly possessed the power to contend against the heavenly might.

“Yin Yang Tenth Heaven…”

Ye Qingtang sensed an enormous power around that elderly that was actually the same as that of Divine King Luo Xue: Yin Yang Tenth Heaven!

Yin Yang Tenth Heaven, which had disappeared from this world for a long time, actually appeared in two people today! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Could it be that… in the era ten thousand years ago, these martial realms are not as simple as Yin Yang Perfected Lord realm…” Ye Qingtang frowned slightly as a perplexed expression emerged in her eyes.

No matter the ancient clan powerful figures or Divine King Luo Xue, although they had the power of a Yin Yang Tenth Heaven, their martial aura was no weaker than hers when she was a Holy Venerate back then!

It was also to say that the martial skills of these people were definitely not as simple as Yin Yang Perfected Lord realm…

In reality, just as Ye Qingtang had guessed, Divine King Luo Xue was unparalleled ten thousand years ago and might defeat even an Emperor-level cultivator ten thousand years later. He was known as a magnificent man who was just a small step away from a True God.

Ten thousand years ago, those powerful family clans were almost at the Emperor level.

Ten thousand years ago, an Emperor-level figure was nothing much as that was a generation where the Divine King was highly respected. There were traces of divinity everywhere, and the brilliance scattered by True Gods could be easily spotted.Powerful figures only had one goal: to become a True God.

This lasted until the extraordinary lady arrived, made this entire mainland, and led the masses towards an even brighter martial route and the realm of a True God.

However, as the extraordinary lady’s divine powers were drained, everything calmed down. The masses could not see any hope of becoming a God and thus vented all their anger on the extraordinary lady and shared her flesh to be consumed.

After the extraordinary lady died, her indignation turned into a curse. She cursed the ancient clan of this mainland to never attain liberation and to be unable to leave this mainland forever, and she dispersed all the spirit energy away from this mainland.

Without the support of spirit energy, the ancient clan members, who were once neck and neck with Emperor-level figures, were as good as having lost all their cultivation base and could only be stuck at the Yin Yang Perfected Lord realm forever. This was also the same for Divine King Luo Xue.

However, those hidden ancient clan members did not know how to break the extraordinary lady’s curse though they were still the most powerful people of this mainland when they remained. They did not allow any member of the ancient clan to leave, especially Divine King Luo Xue.

If Divine King Luo Xue left this mainland and restored the power of a Divine King, everlasting perdition would greet them.

“Divine King Luo Xue, you are heavily injured by the Heavenly Tribulation today, and you will die here!”
