The other disciple of the Admirable Sky Peak in the audience sighed in relief after seeing Yin Qingluo stepped out.

Yin Qingluo glanced at Sheng Qianyu and signaled him to stay quiet. She then looked towards the disciples of the Blue Cloud Peak and said, “I did not say that. I’m just saying the truth here.”

“Junior Sister Yin, you speak so confidently now that you have become the Village Master’s disciple. You were not at the Sea Moon Bay. How would you know that Sheng Qianyu is right? I think that you’re just trying to defend your own Admirable Sky Peak’s disciple.”

Yin Qingluo frowned slightly. Though she was mentally prepared, these Blue Cloud Peak disciples were not kind at all.

“The White Sage belongs to the person who holds it now.” The Blue Cloud Peak disciple sneered.

“Junior Sister Yin, if you think it’s not right, please, invite the warden over.”

Yin Qingluo’s face darkened. The level of the incident would increase if she had to invite the warden over. Furthermore, it disobeyed her Master’s warning.

“Since you can’t make your mind as well, we’ll leave now.” The Blue Cloud Peak disciples were about to turn and leave.

Sheng Qianyu was anxious at the moment. The White Sage was very important to him. If these people left, they might eat the White Sage. Even if he found the warden tomorrow, there would be no proof!

“Stop!” Sheng Qianyu rushed over impatiently.

Yin Qingluo did not expect that Sheng Qianyu would be so impulsive, and she did not have time to react. Sheng Qianyu rushed towards the Blue Cloud Peak disciples.

Sheng Qianyu grabbed the first Blue Cloud Peak disciple and intended to take the White Sage.

“How dare you snatch it?!” A cold smile flashed across the Blue Cloud Peak disciple’s eyes as he saw Sheng Qianyu going to snatch the White Sage by force. He lifted his leg and kicked towards Sheng Qianyu’s stomach.

Sheng Qianyu had just apprenticed at the Falling Sky Valley for a year. His cultivation was incomparable to that of the Blue Cloud Peak disciples. He was kicked, and he collapsed onto the ground.

“Junior Brother Sheng!” Yin Qingluo was shocked.

The Blue Cloud Peak disciples kicked Sheng Qianyu again.

“What do you want!” Yin Qingluo shouted coldly and wanted to take some action.

“Junior Sister Yin, you also saw that he came to me first. What? You can do anything you want just because your Perfected Xuanchen becomes the Valley Master?” One of the Blue Cloud Peak disciples scoffed.

Yin Qingluo stopped and stared at those disciples. She could literally rip their skin off now.

Sheng Qianyu just pulled them, and they dared to beat him like that!

“Give… give me back the White Sage…” Sheng Qianyu covered his stomach and stood up.

“Sheng Qianyu, don’t seek your own death here.” The disciples warned fiercely.

Sheng Qianyu did not seem to hear their words and dashed towards them again.

“How dare you!” The Blue Cloud Peak disciple immediately smashed his fist towards Sheng Qianyu’s head.

Yin Qingluo was shocked. She wanted to stop that, but it was too late.

The Blue Cloud Peak disciple’s fist smashed down. Sheng Qianyu’s heart trembled. However, before the fist landed on his head, it was grabbed tightly by a small, white hand.

Before the Blue Cloud Peak disciple could react, he was kicked out instantly!
