Chapter 92: Xuanling Sect (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Walk on the Path to Heaven; Enter the sect.

If she wanted to cultivate up to a Paragon, she could only rely on the sacred sect.

It was a journey of half a month. Within the carriage, Ye Qingtang saw an increasingly familiar surrounding before her, and a strange feeling arose within her. She lifted her eyes slightly and looked at the tall mountain not far away. That mountain was steep, and its summit was covered in cloud mist. However, Ye Qingtang was very clear that there… was the location of Xuanling Sect.

Above the vague mist, Xuanling Sect stood against the clouds in the sky.

“Xuanling Sect…” As Ye Qingtang looked at the cloud mist at the mountain’s summit, scenes from her previous life flooded her mind.

[Ye Qingtang, you have the Heart of the Demon God in your body. Xuanling Sect cannot keep you anymore.]

In her previous life, Ye Qingtang did not have a spirit root and only found a way to model a fake spirit root after searching for a long time. She used that method and finally entered Xuanling Sect. However… the her then would never have dreamt that the very entrance became a turning point in her life.

Not a good turn, but an abyssal drop.

Her Heart of the Demon God was exposed in a mission, and she was forced out of the sect. Moreover, a Sect Elder with evil intentions, along with other disciples in the sect, told the entire world that she possessed the Heart of the Demon God.

Since then, she turned from avoiding Ye You to becoming everyone’s target of murder.

And from the moment she left Xuanling Sect, Ye Qingtang was like a person hated by everyone, and she got shouted at and beaten up by many. The news of the Heart of the Demon God could no longer be hidden.

After innumerable twists and turns, Ye Qingtang chose Xuanling Sect once again in this life.

This time, it was not only to obtain the Black Heaven Water but more to… seek revenge… Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

In this life, she would not let anyone who harmed her in her previous life off.

“We’re reaching Xuanling Sect very soon. Qingtang, are you ready to participate in the sect assessment?” Si Ye’s voice rang from outside the carriage.

Ye Qingtang chuckled with bright eyes, “I’ve been preparing for this moment for too long.”

…

Below Xuanling Sect and above the clouds was obviously a place with little trace of civilization, yet today, this place was exceptionally “bustling”.

It was difficult for a carriage to ascend the mountain; thus, Si Ye and Ye Qingtang got off the carriage at the foot of the mountain and walked up to the summit.

There were already many people at the summit. In the large groups of people, everyone was donned in luxurious attires and possessed a dignified bearing. Rather, it was Ye Qingtang and Si Ye, who were both relatively young, who dressed casually and in the least numbers. Yet, everyone noticed them once they reached the summit.

“These are all people participating in Xuanling Sect’s entrance assessment?” Si Ye asked Ye Qingtang as they stood aside. He unconsciously looked at the others. Amongst the crowd, it was not difficult to tell that the ones who were really there to participate in the assessment were the young talents while most of the rest were there to send them off.

Ye Qingtang nodded slightly.

“I didn’t think that there would actually be so many people.” Ye Qintang estimated that there were at least more than a hundred people who were there to participate in Xuanling Sect’s entrance assessment.

“It is unknown how many can remain,” Ye Qingtang said coolly.

Every year, all sects would welcome a large batch of people who wished to enter the sect. However, amongst these hundreds of people, it was already rare for one-tenth of them to enter the sect.

Unless one possessed a rare supreme-grade spirit root like Ye You did, to obtain the opportunity to enter a sect, one was required to first have a high enough natural endowment and second, a recommendation by a mighty figure. Moreover, these two conditions were merely qualifications for them to participate in a sect’s entrance assessment.

No one knew whether one could enter.
