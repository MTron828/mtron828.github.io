Chapter 2654 Not Gentle At All (3)

There was a huge altar outside the temple. This was where Ye Qingtang and the Paragon carried out the ceremony to become sworn sisters.

After the ceremony was completed, the Paragon waved her right arm and the temple disappeared without a trace. The two of them returned to the vicinity of the black tower.

“Sister Ye Yue, let’s go take a look at the tower, but we have to be extremely careful. You have to listen to my orders.” The Paragon was firm.

Ye Qingtang nodded and walked towards the black tower with the Paragon. She stood in front as they arrived below the tower.

In a slight trance, she felt like this black tower had transformed into a huge beast that had been lying dormant for a long time, waiting quietly. Ye Qingtang’s emotions suddenly changed. An inexplicable tragic scene surfaced in her mind.

It was unknown where that scene was occurring, but gods and Buddhas filled the sky and were being slaughtered one after another. Countless essence energy was being absorbed by the slaughterers…

“Sister Ye Yue!”

Just as Ye Qingtang was immersed in the image in her mind, she heard a voice calling her.

In the next second, Ye Qingtang lost control of her body and was brought into the air.

Before long, Ye Qingtang returned to her senses. The Paragon was holding onto her left shoulder as she was lifted into the air. She was now a distance away from the tower.

“Sister Ah Yao… This…”

Ye Qingtang looked at the Paragon with a strange expression. The Paragon did not say anything. After seeing that Ye Qingtang had woken up, she slowly descended to the ground.

“Sister Ye Yue, do you know what happened just now?” The Paragon asked Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang shook her head. By the time she regained her senses, she was already lifted into the air by the Paragon.

At this moment, the face of the Paragon was rather grim. She mumbled, “Strange… the image that appeared in my mind just now…” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Sister Ah Yao, what did you see when you approached the black tower?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“I didn’t really see anything. I was a little dazed like you were earlier on, and then there were some memories that didn’t belong to me, running through my mind,” the Paragon said.

Ye Qingtang’s expression grew even more bewildered. Memories that did not belong to her also appeared in the depths of Ye Qingtang’s mind just now.

“Did you see… images of gods and Buddhas being slaughtered?” Ye Qingtang’s eyes flickered as she asked the Paragon.

“Sister Ye Yue, you saw it too?” The Paragon asked.

“Indeed.” Ye Qingtang nodded. “I saw the same memory as Sister Ah Yao, but this memory does not belong to you or me.”

Ye Qingtang had two conjectures now.

The first was that anyone who approached the black tower would experience this strange phenomenon. Their mental state would be disturbed and they would see memories that did not belong to them.

But many supreme experts and factions had already entered the depths many days ago. Could it be that those cultivators did not experience those memories when they approached the black tower… If they did, they would definitely treat the tower as a part of the Fourth Domain legacy and guard it. It was impossible that they would just ignore it.

Weren’t those supreme experts and factions here for the Fourth Domain legacy? How could they ignore this black tower?

This did not make any sense.
