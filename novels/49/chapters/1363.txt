The Emperor said coldly, “General Qiao, you have a good daughter here. How dare you to kill Taoist Master Dongfang! Your family is really not afraid of anything!”

People who were good at refining elixirs were called Taoist Masters in this world. Dongfang Qing was the best Master in refinement in the Yuan Kingdom.

“Your Majesty, Qiao’er is still young. She was crazy for a period of time due to some events. That’s why she made such a huge mistake.” General Qiao was very determined to protect her daughter and pleaded for mercy.

However, the Emperor would not let go of Ye Qingtang so easily.

“General Qiao, I should not take it on your whole family since you have contributed greatly to the kingdom. However, Su Qiao will be dead here. You’re always loyal to me, so she will be just given a glass of poison.”

After the Emperor finished his words, a servant at the side held the glass of poison that was prepared long ago and walked forward.

General Qiao was shocked when he saw the poison. How could he not know about it after being the General for so many years? He was too familiar with its bitter smell.

That was a special poisonous wine in the royal family. It was so poisonous that anyone who consumed a drop of it would have his organs to rot and die. There was absolutely no cure to it.

Obviously, the Emperor did not want to keep Ye Qingtang alive. He did not show any mercy even when General Qiao kneeled and pleaded.

“Your Majesty… I’m willing to use my everything in exchange for Su Qiao’s life. Please, your majesty…”

“Shut up!” The Emperor shouted. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“You should be grateful for your contributions over the years. If not, your entire family will die along with Master Dongfang today! Master Dongfang had been looking for ways to refine immortal elixir for me all the time… Su Qiao did not only kill him, but she also killed my opportunity of being immortal!” The Emperor gritted his teeth and said.

He really wanted to kill the entire General’s family, but he had to acknowledge the contributions from General Qiao, and the prime minister’s family also pleaded for him.

General Qiao’s body was filled with cold sweat. He knew that the Emperor must be very angry, but… he did not expect that he would be so furious.

Su Mo’er was confused as she stared at her nervous father. Why, all of a sudden, would her father protect Su Qiao when he did not care about him all the time?

However…

Su Mo’er received an order from the General’s wife that Su Qiao must be dead here. This would be revenge for Dongfang Qing.

Su Mo’er took a step forward, held the glass, and walked towards Ye Qingtang.

“Elder sister, the mistake you made is unforgivable. You must take this in order to save the entire Su family.”

Ye Qingtang was not familiar with Su Mo’er, but she knew that this was Su Qiao’s sister who took her fiance away. She did not bother to reply to her; instead, she took a glimpse at the poisonous wine.

She could smell its bitterness before even tasting it.

Though she did not know what it was called, based on her medical knowledge, the poisonous wine… might be equivalent to those inferior narcotic drugs.

What kind of poison was this? It contained color and smell?

“Qiao’er, you can’t…” General Qiao was very nervous. He was about to stop Ye Qingtang, but she took over the glass of poisonous wine and drank everything.

People’s reaction in the palace was all different when they saw Ye Qingtang drink the incurable poisonous wine.

Everyone from the Dongfang family was content as they had taken their revenge. Su Mo’er smiled coldly.
