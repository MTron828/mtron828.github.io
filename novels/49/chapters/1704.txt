Chapter 1705: Top Beauty Rankings (4)

How could Mu Ruxue have the cheek to claim that she was more beautiful than Ye Qingtang?

Was she blind?

“Ye Qingtang, don’t forget that you will need to disfigure yourself if you lose.” Mu Ruxue gazed at her high number of votes with a venomous gleam in her eye.

Ye Qingtang stared at Mu Ruxue confidently and only said calmly, “You are the one who has forgotten.”

“What?” Mu Ruxue was taken aback.

Jiang Yisheng immediately piped up. “Mu Ruxue, have you gone stupid with fear? Qingtang already said she wasn’t going to take up the bet. In the end, Baili Xuanyun agreed that if she challenged him and won, the bet would be off. Baili Xuanyun’s dead body is turning cold by now. The bet is no longer valid.”

Mu Ruxue’s face froze. She suddenly remembered this matter. But there was no way she was willing to give up such a good opportunity to seek vengeance on Ye Qingtang.

“This bet is between Ye Qingtang and I. What does Baili Xuanyun have to do with it? I never said that the bet is off. Bystanders’ words are not counted.”

“...” Jiang Yisheng felt that Mu Ruxue was increasingly pushing the limits to the word “shameless”.

“Don’t tell me the members of the Jiang family are all liars who break their promises? Are you all cowardly jokes?” Mu Ruxue smirked.

A slight frown marred Ye Qingtang’s face. She was no longer interested in wasting words with Mu Ruxue.

“Who said my Sister Qing is a liar?” Jiang Shaobai suddenly boomed out. He strolled into the restaurant and clung onto Ye Qingtang’s arm as he stared at the imperious-looking Mu Ruxue.

“This bet is so exciting, of course we must continue it. Let’s see who wins.”

“Shaobai?” Jiang Yisheng stared at Jiang Shaobai in a daze. Did this fool know what was going on?

Mu Ruxue smiled when she heard Jiang Shaobai’s words. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“You said it yourself. Don’t regret it.”

“Of course we won’t regret it. But I worry that you will be the one who ends up regretting it.” Jiang Shaobai grinned.

Mu Ruxue snorted softly. “I have always kept my word. If I lose today, I will disfigure myself in front of everyone.”

“Oh? A light scar will also be considered a disfigurement. Who can be sure you will do it properly?” Jiang Shaobai asked.

“Ah, alright. The winner will disfigure the loser then.” Mu Ruxue immediately added. She was now suspecting Jiang Shaobai of holding some grudge against Ye Qingtang. Why was he saying things that worsened things for her?

Mu Ruxue was just itching to personally destroy Ye Qingtang’s little face.

“You’ll keep your word?” Jiang Shaobai asked.

“With everyone here as my witness, I guarantee my word,” Mu Ruxue answered confidently.

Jiang Shaobai smiled and gazed up at Ye Qingtang. “Sister Qing, I have yet to congratulate you for entering the top ten. Just as well I have a small gift for you today.”

With that, Jiang Shaobai suddenly walked over to the restaurant servant. He opened his space ring and emptied a bunch of paper slips right on the table.

“I came to the restaurant last night as I was feeling rather hungry, and guess what I saw? There was a person sneaking around outside. I caught him and discovered something very, very interesting.” Jiang Shaobai grinned as he spoke.

The restaurant servant was shocked when he saw those paper slips in front of him.

They were the missing voting slips!
