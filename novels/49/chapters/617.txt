“F*ck you!”

At that instant, a furious holler reverberated throughout.

Before Ye Qingtang realized what happened, the white tiger sprinted to them.

“F*ck you. How dare you lie to me!” The white tiger’s fierce eyes glared at Ye Qingtang as it roared in fury.

Seeing that the Fiendcelestial Beast suddenly came over, the Blood Moon Elder was shocked while Ye Qingtang frowned.

Although Ye Qingtang knew that the Fiendcelestial Beast would chase after them, she never thought that this white tiger would be so speedy.

Before long, a surprised expression flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes. This white tiger seemed dumb, but it was not so in reality. Before it left, it actually placed a Fiendcelestial Beast’s aura on her body. Thus, no matter where she escaped to, she would still eventually be found by the Fiendcelestial Beast.

“White Tiger Brother, why did you say that?” Ye Qingtang laughed as she looked at the white tiger without panicking.

“Hmph!” The white tiger scoffed coldly. “Earlier on, we clearly agreed that you would remain at that spot and wait for me. Why did you run away?!”

“Run away?” Ye Qingtang laughed faintly and shook her head. “White Tiger Brother, you’ve misunderstood me already. This place is the Hundred Level Peril Hell of Avicinaraka. How can I keep staying at the same spot to wait for you? Moreover, you’ve already left the Fiendcelestial Beast’s aura on my body. No matter where I flee to, you could still find me. Since that’s the case, why must I flee then?”

After hearing Ye Qingtang, the white tiger was shocked. “You even know about the Fiendcelestial Beast’s aura?”

This human male’s words are not false. Before I left, I did leave the Fiendcelestial Beast’s aura on his body. Otherwise, how could I find him now?

Three hundred years later in her previous life, Ye Qingtang became a Holy Venerate. Thus, her insight and experience could not be compared to those of cultivators on this mainland. Even if it was the aura left by Fiendcelestial Beast on her body, she could distinguish it instantly.

Yet still, Ye Qingtang only realized when the white tiger found them.

“Hmph!” The white tiger scoffed coldly. “I don’t care whether what you said is real or fake. We’ll have a battle according to our agreement earlier. If you can defeat me, I’ll spare your life!”

Ye Qingtang was deep in thought at that moment. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Although her skills were not considered weak on this mainland, she could not do anything when she encountered this Fiendcelestial Beast.

Given this Fiendcelestial Beast’s skills, even a powerful figure at the level of a super sect’s Sect Master would not be able to defeat it.

Swoosh!

At that instant, without giving Ye Qingtang a chance to speak, the white tiger’s body flashed and jumped at Ye Qingtang immediately.

“Careful, Holy Lady!”

The Blood Moon Elder shouted anxiously immediately.

However, before the white tiger landed on the ground, the Heart of the Demon God in Ye Qingtang’s heart beat powerfully.

In almost the blink of an eye, the frightening demonic aura on the white tiger’s body was sucked away in full amount by the Heart of the Demon God in Ye Qingtang’s body.

In the next second, the white tiger in the sky shrunk rapidly. In just the blink of an eye, it shrunk to more than ten times its previous size.

Thud!

The white tiger crashed onto the ground. Currently, it was only about two palms large and resembled a small tiger cub that was a few months old.

The sight caused Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder to be stupefied. Looking at the palm-sized tiger, they were in disbelief.

Ye Qingtang could fully feel that the Heart of the Demon God that absorbed the Fiendcelestial Beast’s demonic powers seemed to have stronger powers.

“F*ck you!”

The white tiger looked at its shrunk body in astonishment and scolded loudly.

“My Heart of the Demon God can actually absorb the Fiendcelestial Beast’s demonic aura…” Ye Qingtang was in thought.
