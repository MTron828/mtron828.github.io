Chapter 1296: Unreasonable (1)

Everyone in the main hall was shocked by Mo Yunxian’s sudden attack.

When the three ambassadors from the Temple of Shadows entered the hall just now, Mo Yunxian had not yet arrived, so she did not know who they were.

Ye Qingtang glanced at the hostile-looking Mo Yunxian. She maintained her composure and simply smiled silently.

However, she quietly glanced at Ling Yan from the corner of her eye.

When the Second Princess saw what was happening, she could not help but look eager to watch the show.

Mo Yunxian’s father commanded the forces of the Eternal Dynasty and was an important person. Mo Yunxian herself was fairly talented, and together with her extreme beauty, she had grown rather arrogant.

Mo Yunxian had admired Ling Yan since they were young and was very possessive of him.

Besides the princesses who were related to Ling Yan, if Mo Yunxian saw any pretty girl draw closer to Ling Yan, she would find some way to get rid of the girl.

Under ordinary circumstances, it would not matter.

But today…

The Second Princess’s gaze fell on Ye Qingtang, who was standing in front of Mo Yunxian.

The Second Princess had also been startled by the sight of Ye Qingtang. As a girl, she could not help but sigh over Ye Qingtang’s beauty.

Now…

Mo Yunxian was probably madly jealous to see such a beautiful woman standing in front of Ling Yan.

Mo Yunxian was beautiful, but not as beautiful as Ye Qingtang.

Given Mo Yunxian’s nature, she would never allow any girl more beautiful than her to live.

However…

Today, Mo Yunxian had provoked the wrong person.

Although the Temple of Shadows was on the decline, its fundamental strength remained. Further, the Temple of Shadows supported the Eldest Prince. Now, not only had Ling Yan become the Crown Prince, this Mo Yunxian had publicly reprimanded an Elder from the Temple of Shadows.

This would be interesting.

The Second Princess was not alone. The Eldest Prince and Princess also looked ready to watch a good show.

If Ling Yan’s fiancée offended an Elder from the Temple of Shadows just after he was made Crown Prince, matters would certainly take an interesting turn.

The Eldest Prince decided to stir the pot a bit more. He rose up and spoke.

“Mo Yunxian, these are my guests. Don’t be rude.”

Mo Yunxian frowned slightly at the Eldest Prince. She knew about the fight to be Crown Prince, but she had always admired Ling Yan, so she was naturally wary of the other princes and princesses. In addition, upon her return, her father had told her that the Eldest Prince had recently allied himself with the Eldest Princess and locked Ling Yan into a dungeon. As a result, she was even more displeased with the Eldest Prince.

Mo Yunxian laughed coldly and spoke.

“Even the guests of the Eldest Prince should have some manners. His Majesty has personally made Elder Brother Yan the Crown Prince, and he is the future Emperor. Eldest Prince, is it appropriate for your guests to show such contempt of our dynasty?”

The Eldest Prince secretly smiled. He knew Mo Yunxian’s personality and hoped that she would make as big a fuss as possible. If she really made an enemy of the Temple of Shadows, it would destabilize Ling Yan’s position as Crown Prince.

“Mo Yunxian, don’t be unreasonable. I don’t think my guest was rude at all.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Mo Yunxian raised her head to look at Ye Qingtang’s utterly beautiful face. A cold, jealous look shone in her eyes.

“She’s only a guest. Setting aside the matter of whether she is fit to toast the Crown Prince of our Dynasty, she did not say a word when toasting him. Isn’t that rude?”
