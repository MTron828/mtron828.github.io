Chapter 2404: Tragic (1)

Ye Qingtang calculated the number of demons here and estimated the number of demons the strongest teams would have killed. With their hoard of demon crystals, they should be able to secure first place. But…

This might not be the case in another few days’ time.

Ye Qingtang was well aware that the true test was not in the number of demons killed, but in the mutual fighting among the teams.

No matter how many demons you killed beforehand and obtained how many demon crystals, the strongest teams would definitely pursue and eliminate the other teams in the final two days so that they could rob them of their crystals.

In this way, not only could you eliminate the competition, you could obtain more crystals.

When Ye Qingtang first heard of the rules, she already knew that the in-fighting in the final two days would be the key.

So it didn’t matter if your team only had a few demon crystals. As long as you could eliminate the other teams, the remaining one would be the victor.

This was also why Ye Qingtang didn’t immediately have her team hunt for demons. The Sleeping Flower was just an unexpected bonus. Since they were able to get a large number of demon crystals without much effort, she would never pass on such a good deal.

All was fair in the team competition. The most powerful would prevail and the teams would do anything just to win.

So Ye Qingtang didn’t stop Lei Yan and the rest from looking for the Sleeping Flower. After all, it was a rare plant and they might be able to make use of it in the final two days.

But Lei Yan and the others didn’t manage to find another Sleeping Flower even after searching for a long time. They were very disappointed.

“Boss, are there any special places with certain conditions in which Sleeping Flowers need to flourish? We can’t keep searching for it blindly. Who knows how long we will take to find more?” Lei Yan sighed. They had searched for an entire day but couldn’t find even a single petal.

A smile was on her face. Just as she was about to say something when the faint smell of blood wafted over.

“Get up into the trees.” Ye Qingtang ordered.

In the blink of an eye, everyone hid in the dense tree branches. After a short while, a wretched-looking team appeared where they had stood.

That team was really looking very pathetic. They were wearing Netherworld Academy uniforms and the teacher was stained all over with blood. A massive wound covered his shoulder and abdomen. He clutched his abdomen tightly to keep the wound closed, to prevent his intestines from spilling out.

That teacher was pretty powerful. Otherwise, a normal practitioner would have already been killed by such a grievous injury. Even so, he was extremely pallid and there was not a pot of color on his face. His eyes were also starting to daze over.

“Is that thing… still chasing us?” The teacher gritted his teeth and forced out that question.

“No.” The teenagers supporting him answered uneasily. Those teenagers also had deep wounds. The gruesome sight of the bone beneath and the splayed flesh was startling.

The teacher gave a heavy sigh before finally letting himself collapse down by a tree. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

All of the teenagers on the team were gravely injured. Who knew what kind of hell they had experienced?

“How is Xu Yue?” The teacher’s eyes were already becoming unfocused. He leaned against the tree as he asked in a weak voice.
