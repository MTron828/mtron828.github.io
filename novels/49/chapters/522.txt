Mu Su was rather worried. The Blood Moon Holy Lord was once the supreme being on this land and was like a God in everyone’s eyes. Could it be that Lady Ye had some relations with him?

“Your Highness, it is best for us to not interfere in the battle between the sects of this mainland this time. Your Highness’s powers must not be disclosed at all especially. Otherwise… if the Heavenly Emperor senses it… I’m afraid…” Mu Su had a look of worry.

Without the Heart of the Demon God, His Highness was no longer the Heavenly Emperor’s opponent and even had to rely on the faint power of faith to sustain his broken body.

Moreover, there was a surge of the Aura of the Evil in His Highness’s body. If the Heavenly Emperor located His Highness now, the situation would be far from encouraging…

Han Cangming frowned slightly without saying anything.

Looking at His Highness’s expression, Mu Su had some guesses in his heart and said immediately, “Your Highness, how about I undertake the task of protecting Lady Ye’s safety?”

Han Cangming’s deep green eyes shut slowly, and he gave a slight nod.

“The battle between Xuanling Sect and Yunxiao Sect…” Mu Su probed.

“There’s no need to be involved in it,” Han Cangming said without emotions.

“Noted,” Mu Su received the orders and said again. “Your Highness, the preparations for the item that you wanted previously are already about completed. The Crimson Blood Pool should be constructed in a few months.”

As long as the Crimson Blood Pool was constructed, His Highness’s body would be stable, and he could step out of Drifting Cloud Island.

Han Cangming nodded lightly.

Then, Mu Su finally retreated.

…

At this instant, the sound of war drums reverberated in Xuanling Sect.

The Xuanling war flag was flown in the sky. Over ten inner sect disciples with determined expressions in their eyes hit the war drums.

The Grand Elder, Sect Master, and other high-ranked executives stood above the Hall.

“Report!”

Suddenly, a Xuanling Sect ran over and knelt on a knee. “Yunxiao Sect is less than fifty miles away from Xuanling Sect and could reach in one hour!”

“Fifty miles…”

A few internal affairs elders looked at the Grand Elder.

“Activate the Sect Protection Formation!” The Grand Elder narrowed his eyes slightly as he ordered.

As he finished his sentence, Elder Mo and the other internal affairs elders started the Sect Protection Array Formation with combined forces.

Xuanling Sect had a long heritage, and although it could not be compared to Yunxiao Sect, it was not to be belittled as well.

Very quickly, golden rays enveloped the entire Xuanling Sect.

“What about the Heavenly Elimination Formation!”

An internal affairs elder questioned. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“The Heavenly Elimination Formation is laid!”

Hundreds of wardens replied uniformly.

“What about the Earth Killing Formation!”

“The Earth Killing Formation is laid!”

At that point, Xuanling Sect had already made full preparations. No matter how powerful one was on this mainland, they had to pay a certain price if they wished to casually destroy a sect!

There was at least a thousand years of history for all sects. How could the heritage that the ancestors left behind be destroyed so easily!

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

The war drums rang continuously, causing one to rise with force and spirit.

“Hoot!”

Suddenly, a long cry of a demonic beast echoed at the scene.

The Xuanling Sect disciples looked up in astonishment.

A gigantic demonic beast of a bird species flapped its wings. Its body was like a mountain range that extended for miles while its voice was extremely horrifying and could crush rocks.

A black glint emerged in that demonic beast’s eyes. As its wings flapped, wild winds were stirred up in the surroundings, resembling a natural disaster.

“Yunxiao Sect… Sect protector divine beast!

The people from Xuanling Sect were stunned.

The aura of that divine beast seemed to have reached Yin Yang True Lord already, meaning it was one of the most formidable demonic beasts on this mainland!
