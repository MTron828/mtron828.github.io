Chapter 119: With All of One’s Fist (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Simply based on boxing skills, Lu Xiuwen is slightly better than Yun Shu,” said the Fist Faction Elder as he observed carefully.

“Yun Shu’s swordsmanship is better than Lu Xiuwen’s,” Elder Lin said.

“However, both of them have pretty strong foundations and also green spirit roots. I believe that once they enter the sect, they will be to our liking with a little more training.” Elder Lin said assertively, implying that he had already approved of Lu Xiuwen and Yun Shu passing the entrance assessment.

The other elders did not have much to say about this, as they were optimistic about those two people as well.

“Only Ye Qingtang is left.” Through the Water Moon Mirror, the Herbal Faction Elder saw Ye Qingtang walking towards the Invasive Stone step by step.

“I wonder how she will do this time,” Elder Qin said as he looked at Ye Qingtang with a complicated expression.

In the previous two segments, Ye Qingtang steadily won against everyone. If her spirit root were just a little better, she would be able to pass the entrance assessment even if her results in the third segment were not good. However…

Elder Lin glanced at Elder Qin with sarcasm filled in his eyes.

Even he was surprised that Ye Qingtang could pass the previous two segments successfully and obtain stunning results. However… Ye Qingtang was at most fifteen, and her spirit root was extremely inferior. Even if she trained hard, she would not be proficient in everything.

As long as Ye Qingtang does not pass the third segment, Xuanling Sect would definitely not let her enter the sect.

No matter how regretful Elder Qin would be, it was still pointless.

At this point, not only the four faction elders’ attention was focused on Ye Qingtang; even the surrounding candidates looked at the tiny figure one after another.

Once Ye Qingtang finished this segment of the assessment, the sect assessment would end, and they would know very quickly whether they were qualified to enter Xuanling Sect.

Ye Qingtang was slightly pale, but it was not because of the Invasive Stone. It was only because she used too much energy in the absolute-kill sword array a while ago; thus, she looked frail at that point in time.

Looking at the dark, black Invasive Stone before her, there was not a slight hint of emotion in Ye Qingtang’s eyes. She stood there quietly and did not hit it immediately. Instead, she took a deep breath and closed her eyes slowly

In her mind, memories from her previous life flashed across scene by scene.

Suddenly! Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Ye Qingtang opened her eyes, and a sharp light shone in her clear, black orbs. The energy around her whole body flowed and gathered in her left fist.

This slight change shocked the candidates around her. They could faintly sense that a strong aura was being emitted from Ye Qingtang’s body.

This aura was simply not what a person with a red spirit root could possess.

Just when everyone was astonished over Ye Qingtang’s action, Ye Qingtang planted her feet firmly on the ground, and the fist which contained all the strength was suddenly hit against the ever-ductile Invasive Stone!

Like a passing breeze…

There was not a slight sound in the huge venue. Everyone’s eyes were focused on Ye Qingtang’s fist which landed on the Invasive Stone.

Below that fair fist, the Invasive Stone was not at all damaged, and there was not even the faintest dent.

“Ha.”

Someone in the crowd suddenly let out a mocking laugh.

Suddenly, small sounds rang.

The middle-aged man who was in charge of the assessment was taken aback as well. Perhaps it was because Ye Qingtang’s performance was too remarkable in the previous two assessments that he unconsciously thought that Ye Qingtang would definitely perform well in the third segment.

This thought had never disappeared even when he saw Ye Qingtang directing her energy.

Yet, unexpectedly…
