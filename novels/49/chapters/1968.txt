Chapter 1969: Spy (1)

Ye Qingtang’s eye brightened as she heard this and she quickly rushed over.

The others from the Jiang family had already met up with Jiang Xun and the rest when she headed over. But even though they had said that some of them had managed to escape, there were at most only eight or nine people in total, including Jiang Xun and the rest.

Mo Yi was with them as well.

“You mean... Aunt Qin... Jiang Qin and Ye You really betrayed the Jiang family?” A pale-faced Jiang Yiming looked at Jiang Xun in confusion. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Jiang Yiming had been great friends with Ye You back when he was in the Jiang family and was Ye You’s second-biggest backer in the family. He had used to cause Ye Qingtang a lot of trouble because of her.

Never would he have dreamed that the two people closest to him would end up being the downfall of the Jiang family.

His entire being seemed to collapse.

His parents had died in the hands of the young man from the Ancient You Clan.

Jiang Liu patted Jiang Yiming’s shoulders and sighed sorrowfully.

“I knew from the start that that Ye You was nothing good.” The Northstar Demon Lord had both his hands on his waist as his face filled with anger.

To him, anyone who wasn’t on his sister’s side was bad.

Ye Qingtang couldn’t help but smile as she saw Northstar Demon Lord in high spirits. She could tell that he was much stronger than he was before.

Apart from this familiar face, Ye Qingtang spotted You Qiong as well...

What was You Qiong doing here?

Ye Qingtang thought that this was strange but an idea surfaced in her heart as she looked at You Qiong.

The people from the Jiang family stepped forward as they saw the “Holy Lord of Shadows” approaching them in her gold mask.

“Greetings, Holy Lord.”

They knew that Ye Qingtang had saved the Domain Monarch, Jiang Lang and Jiang Xun and were grateful for that.

Ye Qingtang nodded slightly as her gaze brushed past Mo Yi.

Mo Yi’s expression was terrible. Her previous wound had not healed entirely yet and the tragedy on the Jiang family had taken a toll on her as well.

Seeing her current state, Ye Qingtang’s heart sank.

The Jiang family didn’t dare make any mistakes in front of the Holy Lord. Even though they were grateful, they were still overly cautious in front of her. Only Northstar Demon Lord gazed bright-eyed at the rumored powerful Holy Lord, which made Ye Qingtang smile.

She let the Jiang family take refuge in the Temple for now but was curious about why Northstar Demon Lord had followed them. It was then that she heard the answer from Northstar Demon Lord himself.

The Ancient You Clan’s influence had already spread to the demons’ territory and many of them had decided to side with the Ancient You Clan. Northstar Demon Lord was arrogant and refused to be associated with those demons so he had escaped.

“Since you’re already here, just stay.” Ye Qingtang didn’t want any harm to come to her brother.

Northstar Demon Lord’s mouth split into a smile as he thanked her, thinking in his heart that the rumored Holy Lord of Shadows wasn’t as scary as he thought after all. She was kind.

As Ye Qingtang’s gaze swept over them, she realized that the small You Qiong was hiding behind them, as though he was keeping something from her.

Ye Qingtang smiled in her heart and singled him out.

You Qiong’s heart almost jumped out of his chest as he was singled out and he wanted nothing more than to die in that instant.

“Greetings, Holy Lord,” You Qiong said cautiously. All he had in his mind was the thought that no matter what, he could not let himself be thrown out.
