Chapter 2214: Training (2)

They were all Paragon Sixth Heaven Level and above, and were able to easily travel at high speeds. Even so, they had already journeyed for several days and nights and had yet to arrive at Ye Qing’s so-called training grounds.

Ye Qing also refused to tell them where they were going. The teenagers’ curiosity grew increasingly intense. Until the 10th day, the teenagers were finally led by Ye Qing to the outside of a grey forest. The sight made the teenagers all turn pale.

Looking at that gloomy forest, Lei Yan could feel all his hairs standing straight up. The plants in this forest were exceptionally queer, he couldn’t see any bit of green. It was all grey as if it had lost all color.

They were standing on the outside of the forest but could already feel the subtle death energy and bitter cold intertwined with the dense fog enveloping the place. It was like they were going to step into some deadly ghost realm, somewhere that did not belong to the mortal world.

“Has B-Boss... gone mad? This... this... is the Evil Soul Forest!” Lei Yan stammered. At this point, his face looked even worse than if he had been crying.

The expressions of the other teenagers were just as terrible. Only Jing Ze and Mu Ziying looked befuddled. They had never heard of the Evil Soul Forest.

“The Evil Soul Forest. What is this place?” Jing Ze looked at the frightened Lei Yan doubtfully.

The corners of Lei Yan’s lips twitched as he looked at Jing Ze as if he was a monster.

“You... don’t know about the Evil Soul Forest?”

Jing Ze nodded quietly.

Lei Yan hesitated, not knowing how to explain to Jing Ze and Mu Ziying.

At this moment, Ye Qing’s voice rang out.

“The Evil Soul Forest used to be a normal forest, but tens of thousands of years ago, a battle between deities and demons occurred here. Legend had it that a fiendcelestial died in this forest. His life energy dissipated but the remnants of his divine consciousness remained. The fiendcelestial’s divine consciousness guided all the souls in the Second Domain to gather here. All the living creatures in this forest were devoured by those souls, transforming this place into a forbidden area. Any living creature who steps foot into this forest will be cursed by the fiendcelestial’s divine consciousness, and then ripped to pieces by the countless souls here...” Ye Qing’s voice was soft and flat as if narrating an ancient tale to innocent little children.

Lei Yan was already covered in goosebumps.

By the side, Nangong Lie also looked very grim. He rubbed the goosebumps on his arms.

“Boss, don’t tell me you want us to train in the Evil Soul Forest?”

Ye Qingtang turned to look at Nangong Lie, whose face was filled with disbelief. Under his despondent gaze, she nodded.

“Congratulations, you’ve guessed correctly.”

Nangong Lie felt like crying. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Could he beg for another chance to answer!

“Boss, just tell us if you are unhappy about anything or if we displeased you in any way. Why don’t you just lash us a couple of times instead...”

Why so much hatred? Why so vengeful?

Why send them into the Evil Soul Forest?

This was a major forbidden area in the domain!

“Boss, please have mercy. We cannot enter such a place.” Lei Yan just wanted to run as far from this Evil Soul Forest as possible.

Qin Feng and Yun Chen also looked conflicted. Meanwhile, Jing Ze and Mu Ziying had never heard of the Evil Soul Forest before, and so didn’t have much of a reaction.
