Chapter 856 Pretending To Be A Student

As they chatted, Ye Qingtang was woken up by strange noises outside the cave. She walked out of the cave with a frown and saw an enlarged little white tiger and Ling Yan, who was full of smiles.

“What are… the two of you doing?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Just now…”

The little white tiger wanted to speak but was interrupted by Ling Yan. “Nothing much. It’s just that I haven’t seen a Fiendcelestial Beast’s graceful bearing before. Thus, I asked little tiger senior to widen my knowledge.”

“Who are you calling a little tiger?” After hearing Ling Yan’s address, the little white tiger immediately stood up with an unhappy expression.

“What do you like then, senior?” Ling Yan asked with a smile.

“Call me ‘big tiger’!” the little white tiger said proudly.

“Alright, big tiger senior.” Ling Yan nodded.

“Are you two done?” Ye Qingtang asked coldly.

Afterward, she returned back to the cave, leaving the little white tiger and Ling Yan staring at each other.

“Ling Yan, why didn’t you let me tell the truth just now? That little bastard wanted to kill you,” the little white tiger said.

“What is the point if I said it? Only you know about it. How would others believe why it wants to kill me, especially her?” Ling Yan dismissed it with a laugh.

Upon hearing that, the little white tiger pondered about it and thought that what Ling Yan said made sense.

“Furthermore, Miss Ye and I are not that close yet. Even if I’m really killed by it, it will only be scolded at most.” Ling Yan added.

“Ah… That little bastard even wished to seize my body previously.” The little white tiger muttered.

“Big tiger senior, you should understand why it wishes to seize your body, shouldn’t you?” Ling Yan asked meaningfully.

“F*ck. Of course I know.” The little white tiger nodded repeatedly. “It wants my life.”

“In the future, big tiger senior must be more careful.” Ling Yan reminded.

“Of course. I’m always paying attention to that little bastard.” The little white tiger was angry once the little black ball was mentioned.

“Great. Our conversation will end here today. Only you and I need to know about this matter.” Ling Yan stood up and gazed at the hill ahead.

Not long later, Ling Yan’s lips curled up slightly, and he said, “The time is about right.”

“What time is about right?” The little white tiger asked curiously.

“Nothing much. It’s just that I arranged some chips for Miss Ye to survive in the Dragon Vein.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Subsequently, Ling Yan turned around and headed back into the cave.

Not long later, Ling Yan sat beside Ye Qingtang. Before Ling Yan spoke, Ye Qingtang suddenly opened her eyes.

“What are you doing?” Ye Qingtang stood up instantly.

“I have something to discuss with you.” Ling Yan smiled.

“Speak.” Ye Qingtang replied.

“In my Eternal Dynasty, there is an academy called the Supreme Academy. This time, some students of the Supreme Academy came to this mainland as well and entered the Dragon Vein. I wish to let Miss Ye pretend to be a senior sister from the Supreme Academy.” Ling Yan explained.

Ye Qingtang was stunned and asked unknowingly, “Why?”

Ye Qingtang heard something about the Supreme Academy as well. It was one of the most renowned academies in Eternal Dynasty, and according to Ye Qingtang’s memory, the President of the Supreme Academy had already relied on the Crown Prince of Eternal Dynasty, who was also Ling Yan’s eldest brother.

That Crown Prince wanted to finish Ling Yan off for good, and so did the Supreme Academy naturally. However, why did Ling Yan want her to pretend to be a student from the Supreme Academy…
