Chapter 423: The Competition (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Xuanling Sect had lost too many times such that even Wind Moon Sect had surpassed them and steadily placed second. If Xuanling Sect still did not have any achievements this year, they would most probably end up as a laughing stock to the other two sects.

“Rest assured. This year will definitely not be like the past few years. I have confidence in Zhu Changge.” Elder Lin smiled.

Although Zhu Changge’s eyes never left the ring, he heard everything that the elders said and took a deep breath as confidence stretched on his face.

After rounds of battles, the elders of the sects had a clear understanding of the situation.

A Wind Moon Sect elder took the lead to nod at a disciple beside him, who went up to the ring subsequently.

“Feng Yiran of Wind Moon Sect?” Elder Mo’s eyes narrowed slightly when he saw the Wind Moon Sect disciple who walked up to the ring.

“Feng Yiran is the most skilled in this group of Wind Moon Sect disciples. He seems to have reached the second stage of the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two. With Wind Moon Sect sending Feng Yiran up now, they probably want to end this competition as quickly as possible,” Elder Lin said with a laugh.

As he spoke, Feng Yiran had already defeated a disciple on the ring and was waiting for disciples from the other two sects to challenge him in the stance of a victor.

Zhu Changge looked at Elder Lin, wanting to enter the ring.

However, Elder Lin shook his head.

“There’s no hurry. Since Wind Moon Sect already sent Feng Yiran, Qinglin Sect would naturally not waste any time either. We’ll let them fight first. It is not late to go up after seeing their skills.”

Zhu Changge followed the orders and sat down silently.

As expected, not long after Elder Lin spoke, the Qinglin Sect elders had already given orders to Fu Lingtian, who immediately leaped up into the ring.

“Fu Lingtian from Qinglin Sect. Do enlighten me.” Once Fu Lingtian was in the ring, everyone was enthusiastic immediately.

Feng Yiran was not surprised by Fu Lingtian’s appearance and cupped his hands in front of his chest. “Feng Yiran from Wind Moon Sect.”

Feng Yiran and Fu Lingtian were at a similar skill level, and this match was truly a wrestle between a tiger and a dragon.

The expressions of all the elders became serious at that instant. The real competition only began now.

The atmosphere in the ring turned heavy. Fu Lingtian had placed first for three consecutive years, and even if it was Feng Yiran, he had to be careful.

Then, Feng Yiran directed his energy and took the lead to attack Fu Lingtian.

Both disciples were at the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level One, and one could imagine how powerful they were. In just the blink of an eye, there were thunderous sounds of explosions on the ring. With electricity in the air, both parties charged forward with full force and were locked in combat.

The intensity in the ring right now was incomparable to before. The disciples of the Wind Moon Sect and Qinglin Sect widened their eyes as they watched the battle between the aces of both teams. Ardor and zeal coursed through their blood.

Zhu Changge fixed his eyes on the two people on the ring. He was very clear that after this match, the person remaining on the ring would be the opponent he would be facing. With the heavy responsibility of protecting the sect’s glory, Zhu Changge did not dare to be the slightest bit careless. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Fu Lingtian is indeed steady. Feng Yiran’s attacks are sharp, and it seems that the Wind Moon Sect elders taught him meticulously.” Elder Mo’s expression was tense as he observed the sparring on the ring.

Feng Yiran’s attacks were extremely fast, and his movements were swift, while Fu Lingtian was as stable as Mount Taishan[a symbol of great weight or import]—no matter which tricky spot Feng Yiran attacked from, Fu Lingtian could resolve all of them.

Neither of them had the upper hand. As the swords glimmered, a sharp expression flashed across Fu Lingtian’s eyes, and he suddenly attacked with a sword which directly passed Feng Yiran’s incoming sword and stabbed towards his glabella.
