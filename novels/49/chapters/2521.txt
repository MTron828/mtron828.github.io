Ye Qingtang quietly sized up the golden-robed man and the golden book elder. They were both extraordinary and if they came to blows, perhaps she might be able to escape during the chaos.

Thereafter, Ye Qingtang secretly glanced at the lady in green. Her martial skills were no longer the same as before. The speed at which her skills increased was too fast. Back at the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix, Ye Qingtang learned that this lady in green was the reincarnation of a True God and had a boundless destiny.

“We are Sky Vault Sect’s disciples. This is a Sky Vault Branch Master,” one of the ladies said to the golden book elder.

“Sky Vault Sect…”

At the side, Ye Qingtang looked at everyone and frowned slightly. The Sky Vault Sect was famous and was highly ranked in the entire Second Domain.

In her previous life, Ye Qingtang had heard of the Sky Vault Sect. The Paragon of the Sky Vault Sect was an extraordinary person in the Second Domain who had the ability to cover the sky.

Ye Qingtang did not expect that this lady in green would actually join the Sky Vault Sect.

However, the fact that this lady in green was a reincarnation of a True God was enough for the Sky Vault Sect to groom her. Ye Qingtang guessed that this lady in green did not reveal her identity. Otherwise, the Sky Vault Sect’s Supreme Martial Artist would definitely take her in as a disciple. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Although Ye Qingtang was surprised, she had heard of the Sky Vault Sect’s reputation. On the other hand, the golden book elder and his group did not seem to be impressed.

“Sky Vault Sect… Even if you’re from the Temple of Paragon, I’m afraid you are still unworthy.” The golden book elder sneered.

“Oh, it seems that you are quite arrogant.” The golden-robed man looked at the golden book elder. The corners of his lips curled up into a cold smile. “In that case, I would like to ask where you are from.”

“None of your business. You are not worthy enough to know either,” said the golden book elder.

“I see. In that case, you must pay the price for your arrogance.”

As he spoke, the golden-robed man raised his right arm and tapped lightly with his finger.

In the blink of an eye, countless sword lights surged out from all directions. The sword lights were like rainbows, their auras unparalleled. They slashed towards the golden book elder and his group.

“Sky Penetrating Sword Intent…” The golden book elder observed as he sneered.” Looks like I’ve really underestimated you. You can actually execute the Sky Penetrating Sword Intent so easily.”

The golden book elder remained unmoving. Even as he spoke, he did not move at all. When the countless sword lights struck, Ye Qingtang saw that the elder quickly opened the golden book in his hand and muttered something.

In the next second, an enormous golden avatar descended like a True God and stood guard beside the old man. Even the extremely terrifying Sword Intent was unable to break through the golden avatar’s defenses.

There was a constant rumbling sound, accompanied by a large amount of dust.

Following that, the golden avatar’s eyes widened in fury. It raised its arm and formed a gigantic demon palm that smacked towards the golden-robed middle-aged man.

Bam!

In the blink of an eye, the two supreme auras collided with each other, causing everyone to be thoroughly shocked.

“I… this… he…” The Blood Moon Elder was flabbergasted. After being stunned for a long time, he looked at Ye Qingtang.” Holy… Holy Lady, this, this is… Emperor-level…”

There was no need for the Blood Moon Elder to state the obvious. Ye Qingtang could feel the power of these people herself.

This was especially true for the golden book elder and the golden-robed man.. Their strength was beyond description.
