At the same time, the Demonic Blood Sword in Ye Qingtang’s hand landed.

Clank!

The sound of clashing metal reverberated throughout.

Ning Luo used his right arm to block it.

“Is that… the Paragon Skill!” A certain Xuanling Sect disciple exclaimed in alarm.

A layer of frost covered Ning Luo as cold air enshrouded him. He used his right arm that was covered in frost to block in front of him, bearing the force of Ye Qingtang’s sword!

“Ye Qingtang, this is the Paragon Skill… the Frost.” Ning Luo’s lips curled up. As he spoke, several icicles were formed in the sky and shot down at Ye Qingtang from all angles, wanting to pierce through Ye Qingtang.

“Paragon Skill, the Frost?” Ye Qingtang scoffed. “It’s merely like that only.”

Then, Ye Qingtang swept her Demonic Blood Sword across, breaking all the icicles.

“Now it’s interesting.” Ning Luo kept his sword and guided the frost to form an ice pike in his hand.

Whiz!

The ice pike was charged towards Ye Qingtang immediately.

Ye Qingtang was not frightened at all as she slashed it with her Demonic Blood Sword.

Boom!

As the Demonic Blood Sword clashed with the ice pike, Ye Qingtang felt an unbearable icy air which wanted to corrode her.

The moment the Demonic Blood Sword came into contact with the pike, ice covered the Demonic Blood Sword so rapidly, wanting to seal Ye Qingtang altogether.

Slightly shocked, Ye Qingtang immediately abandoned the Demonic Blood Sword.

As the Demonic Blood Sword fell on the ground, the intensity of the freezing never slowed down as the ground within ten meters from the spot was covered by ice at a speed visible to the naked eye.

“Ha… your reaction isn’t slow.” A playful smile was hung on Ning Luo’s face.

If Ye Qingtang had not abandoned the Demonic Blood Sword, she would definitely be sealed by the ice.

Despair arose in the hearts of the Xuanling Sect disciples when they saw how scary Ning Luo’s Paragon Skill was.

Earlier, they actually innocently thought that they could capture Ning Luo and bring him back to Xuanling Sect.

If they knew this from the start, they would never offend Ning Luo so brazenly no matter how courageous they were.

“What moves do you still have? Show them all,” Ye Qingtang said without emotion as she looked at Ning Luo.

“With things as such, you still want to speak so mightily. Ye Qingtang, you’re truly stubborn.” Ning Luo laughed.

An imprint was formed in his hands as he spoke.

Instantly, snow floated in the sky, and an icy air rose from the ground.

In just a moment, the coldness extended a hundred meters out, and before Ye Qingtang knew what happened, her legs were already frozen.

“This is bad…” Ye Qingtang frowned slightly. She originally wanted to crush the ice with her feet and escape from it, but she realized that the ice was as hard as steel. Feeling the disturbance of this biting chill, the primordial qi in her body was completely sealed and could not be used.

“Junior Sister Ye!”

Zhu Changge shouted when he noticed what happened and flew forward, using his sword to slash the ice on Ye Qingtang’s body.

Bang!

However, not only was this slash unable to damage the ice the slightest bit, Zhu Changge’s hand was numbed instead, and he was flung several meters away from the impact.

“Junior Sister Ye, don’t be afraid. I’ll save you!”

Qin Huan leaped forward as well and condensed all his might in his hands, hitting the ice that rapidly froze on Ye Qingtang’s body. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Ow…”

Similar to Zhu Changge, Qin Huan let out a miserable cry and was flung over ten meters away by the force of the frozen ice.
