Chapter 2365: Regulations (2)

But not every academy was good enough to participate in the Inter-Academy Competition. They had to undergo a round of qualifying competitions first and only the top few winners would earn the right to come to Universe City and participate in the real Inter-Academy Competition.

In the past, the Netherworld Academy did not need to undergo the qualifying competition, but now, the Netherworld Academy was not like it used to be. According to the regulations, if they could not produce good results in this year’s competition, they would lose that privilege.

As the elder spoke, Wen Qi had already led Ye Qing and the others into the main hall. But their arrival did not attract the attention of the other academies. It was like no one could be bothered about them at all.

This was an academy that was about to lose its privilege to automatically qualify for the Inter-Academy Competitions and so the other academies completely dismissed them. They were more focused on this year’s competition regulations and their true rivals.

Wen Qi was used to their dismissive attitudes. He led Ye Qing and the others to a corner and sat down. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Ye Qing, do you know why so many academies fight so hard to qualify for the Inter-Academy Competition?” Wen Qi suddenly asked Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang shook her head.

She had never enrolled in an academy in the Second Domain during her previous life so it was only natural she had no idea.

“It’s because of the God Relic,” Wen Qi said in a low voice.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes glinted.

“God Relic?”

Wen Qi nodded. “Where the Universe City is standing now, it used to be the biggest and most magnificent temple. It was constructed on this spot because a god left behind a relic here. It is similar to a mystic realm, yet also completely different. The God Relic cannot usually be found. It will only open during a special period and only a limited number of people will be allowed inside…”

The Universe City was where the God Relic was hidden. Nearly everyone in the Second Domain had tried to fight over the God Relic, but thereafter, they realized that it was only effective for youths who had yet to reach the age of 20.

Many powerful practitioners were extremely frustrated over this. But the major family clans, academies and sects were inspired.

There were five separate entrances to the God Relic. And every entrance only allowed a certain number of entrants.

To reduce the endless conflicts, the various factions had come to an agreement. Factions would be assigned to a particular entrance and they could then fight over that allocated entrance.

The entrance situated at the Universe City had been allocated to the various academies, and they fought over the right to the entrance via a very simple method. The Inter-Academy Competition, where the most talented teenagers would gain the chance to enter.

This was why the various academies invested so much effort just to qualify for the Inter-Academy Competition.

“Only a hundred people are allowed to enter the entrance located at the Universe City. In the past, our academy once managed to send over a dozen students into the God Relic. But Ye Qing, do you know how many students of ours managed to win the privilege in the last competition?” Wen Qi asked.

Ye Qingtang shook her head.

A bitter look surfaced on Wen Qi’s face. He lifted a single finger.

“One, only one.”

Ye Qingtang couldn’t resist an inward sigh after hearing this.

“Unless the Netherworld Academy manages to have at least three students win that privilege, our academy will be struck off the priority list. We will need to undergo a qualifying competition with the other normal academies first and win them before being able to participate in the Inter-Academy Competition…” Wen Qi’s voice was very grave. The Netherworld Academy’s situation was not optimistic at all.
