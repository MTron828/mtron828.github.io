1365 Gap 1

“Your Majesty, Su Qiao is dead now. Please forgive my family.” Su Mo’er was very sure that Ye Qingtang must be dead. She kneeled down towards the Emperor and pleaded for mercy for the General using her identity as the Prime Minister’s daughter-in-law.

The Emperor frowned, but before he could say anything…

“Is there more?” After drinking the glass of poisonous wine, Ye Qingtang shook the empty glass and stared at everyone in the palace calmly.

“…”

Everyone looked towards Ye Qingtang unbelievably.

“What… what did you say?” Su Mo’er could not believe what she just heard.

“Say, do you have more wine? I’m quite thirsty.” Ye Qingtang did not drink any water after stepping into this world. She really felt thirsty, especially after a long period of cultivation.

The wine…

It was bitter but still could quench her thirst.

As for the poison…

Ye Qingtang could release the poison just by taking a breath with her Second Heaven of Arcane Supremacy ability.

“You…” It was as if Su Mo’er had just seen a ghost.

That is the most poisonous wine here. Did Su Qiao become a real idiot?

How could she ask for another glass?

Besides Su Mo’er, both the Dongfang family and General Qiao were shocked.

“Your Majesty, I don’t feel anything with that one glass of poisonous wine. How about a few more glasses? Maybe I’ll die faster with the additional toxicity.” Ye Qingtang noticed the reaction from everyone else and said slowly.

The Emperor’s lips twitched slightly as he had never seen anyone being so willing to die. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Sure, since you want to die faster, I’ll give you what you want!”

The Emperor asked someone to pass the whole bottle of poisonous wine to Ye Qingtang.

People from the Dongfang family pulled themselves out of surprise. Ye Qingtang would die from rotten organs soon after she took the poisonous wine. They could just watch her suffer slowly until death.

The servant who was holding the bottle wanted to help Ye Qingtang pour another glass, but she took over the entire bottle and finished everything inside in front of everyone.

It was the first time they saw someone that could drink poisonous wine so generously.

Ye Qingtang’s thirst was quenched, and the little trace of toxicity disappeared as she breathed out slowly.

The poisonous wine might not even be able to kill a Connate Level One cultivator…

Anyone who knew how to cultivate using spirit energy had some defense against poison. Unless the toxicity of the toxin was above the person’s level, the poison would not have any effect.

However, no one there knew about that.

They were all waiting for Ye Qingtang to die when her organs were punctured by the poison.

However, after a long while…

Ye Qingtang was still standing there. Her face was radiant, and she looked like she was full of energy.

“…”

Did someone swap the poisonous wine?

“Qiao’er… You… do you feel anything wrong?” General Qiao, who was depressed, suddenly saw that the poisonous wine did not seem to have any effect on his daughter.

“What do I need to feel?” Ye Qingtang said.

General Qiao’s lips twitched. He suddenly remembered the bright light appeared on top of Ye Qingtang’s room earlier on and was stunned. He wanted to say something, but the Emperor cut in.

“Long Qi!”
