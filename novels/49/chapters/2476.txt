Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang looked at the Yongle Tribe General and nodded without saying anything else. Meanwhile, the big yellow dog was sitting on her lap, wagging its tail nonstop.

“Hey, little kid, why aren’t you inviting us back with you? That’s right, prepare more food for me, and make sure that the food is prepared with care. My stomach is very delicate,” the big yellow dog told the Yongle Tribe General.

The Yongle Tribe General froze as he heard the big yellow dog speak.

“Ancestor Qing, this is…” the Yongle Tribe General stared at Ye Qingtang, not understanding the situation.

Hearing that, Ye Qingtang’s mouth twitched and she said, “My celestial pet.”

“Celestial pet…” the Yongle Tribe General looked at the big yellow dog. It didn’t look like one at all.

“Is there a problem?” the big yellow dog asked.

“No, I was just curious, please forgive me. I will make sure to prepare the food properly,” the Great General quickly said.

“Good,” the big yellow dog said as it nodded.

“Since that’s the case, please wait for a moment as I prepare the accommodations before inviting you back.” the Great General said as he looked at the Flying Star Academy teacher.

“Go.” With that, the Flying Star Academy teacher waved his hands.

The Yongle Tribe General quickly retreated

Everyone heaved a sigh of relief after the Yongle Tribe General left.

“Boss, I don’t think the Yongle Tribe General completely believed what we said,” Qin Feng told Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang frowned and did not rebuke him.

He was right. The Yongle Tribe General still had his doubts towards them but he didn’t dare act rashly right now. He was going to continue observing them after inviting them back.

“What should we do then? Won’t we be walking towards our death if we follow him back?” Nangong Lie’s face was filled with surprise.

“That’s right. Look at how calm the Yongle Tribe General was. He was nothing compared to the two demons before him. I’m afraid that if we follow him back to the Yongle Tribe, we’ll be exposed if we’re not careful and that’ll be the end of us,” Lei Yan said with a sigh.

Having said that, it was still clear to them that even though their situation was not great, it beat staying outside. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The tracking marks were still on them, which meant that the Xihai Tribe demons would never let them go. Rather than waiting for their death here, it would be better to follow the Yongle Tribe General back to the Yongle Tribe.

Furthermore, it wouldn’t be long before Ye Qing could take them out of this damned place.

Taking advantage of the Yongle Tribe General’s absence, they discussed their situation for a while before deciding to return to the Yongle Tribe with the Great General.

...

After a long while, the Yongle Tribe General returned and invited them back to the tribe. The higher-ups of the Yongle Tribe pulled over a carriage to bring them back to the tribe.

The Yongle Tribe was located near the Xihai Tribe and the entire mountain belonged to the Yongle Tribe. The Yongle Tribe had almost no conflicts at all in this space. Apart from the conflict with the Xihai Tribe, it had almost no contact with the other tribes at all.

The Flying Star Academy teacher, Ye Qingtang and the rest of them were arranged to stay in the west wing of the Yongle Tribe. During the weekdays, apart from the Great General, no one was to set foot in the area.

…

At this moment, in a great hall of the Yongle Tribe.

“Great Ancestor, please let me know what to do this time.. If there’s anything I can help with, you only need to ask,” the Yongle Tribe General told the Flying Star Academy teacher.
