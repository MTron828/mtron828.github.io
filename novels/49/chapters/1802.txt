Chapter 1803: Fleeing The Valley (2)

The abandoned camp further enraged the big three. They immediately issued the command to pursue all the fiendish demons who had fled.

Ye Qingtang couldn’t help heaving a secret sigh of relief on hearing that. It looked like the eastern Great General was rather competent and able to avoid a total annihilation.

However, Ye Qingtang had no idea how long the eastern fiendish demons could evade the big three.

Meanwhile, the Deity Ocean inside her didn’t exhibit the kind of absolute power touted by the fiendish demons. This made Ye Qingtang feel very helpless. If she could become more powerful, she might be able to help rebuild the eastern camp.

After an interminably long and tiring journey, Ye Qingtang finally arrived at the end of the mountain valley. The moment she left the valley, Ye Qingtang just felt like everything that had happened in the valley was just one big nightmare.

The further she got from the valley, the warmer the temperature was. After several days of hasty traveling, that warmth had turned into an unbearably scorching heat.

After going past another mountain range, a blazing red earth filled Ye Qingtang’s line of sight.

“Is this... the Scorched Hot Lands?” Ye Qingtang was stunned by the sight of that deep red earth. Hot lava flowed within the numerous cracks on the ground.

If the cold of the Frozen Ice Fields was enough to turn a person’s blood to ice, then the heat of the Scorched Hot Lands was enough to evaporate all the moisture in a person’s body.

Ye Qingtang stood motionless on the mountain peak. The strong winds that blew at her were so hot that they felt like flames licking her skin. Within seconds, Ye Qingtang was already drenched in sweat. She looked like she had just been dunked in a pool of water.

In the next moment, Ye Qingtang unceremoniously dumped Little White Tiger on the ground.

“Damn! What are you doing!” Little White Tiger had been enjoying the luxury of being carried. Suddenly tossed onto the floor by Ye Qingtang, it tumbled a couple of times and looked very annoyed.

“It’s hot.” Ye Qingtang shot Little White Tiger a derisive look.

“...” Little White Tiger was dazed. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

In the Frozen Ice Fields, Little White Tiger’s body heat had been like a hot water bottle, warm and cosy in her arms. But in the Scorched Hot Lands, holding Little White Tiger was like hugging a bag of hot charcoal in the height of a summer day.

“You have changed.” Little White Tiger looked very aggrieved.

“...” Ye Qingtang was speechless.

“For so many days you loved hugging me and would hold me as and when you can. But now you are spurning me for being too hot! Women are indeed capricious.” Little White Tiger’s voice was full of rebuke.

“Wait a moment, where did you learn to say such things?” Ye Qingtang felt a headache coming on.

When did this fellow become such a diva?

“You think I am too hot, but why aren’t you dumping this little punk on the ground too?” Little White Tiger pointed one paw at Little Heavenly Demon, who was still in Ye Qingtang’s arms.

The corners of Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched. Little Heavenly Demon was still sleeping. How would it be able to follow them if she tossed it on the floor?

Instead, Ye Qingtang chose to just ignore Little White Tiger’s hissy fit. She stared seriously at the Scorched Hot Lands. There was still a lingering fear after meeting all those monsters in the Frozen Ice Fields.

Just as Ye Qingtang was pondering how to safely travel through the dangerous Scorched Hot Lands, Little Heavenly Demon suddenly gave a lazy stretch and opened its groggy eyes.

“Gurgle...” As Little Heavenly Demon woke up, a familiar noise escaped from its belly.
