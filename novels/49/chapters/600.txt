Before this extraordinary gain, had they ever thought of Ye Qingtang as their companion?

The moment those people spoke, a few shadows from faraway darted towards them.

The leader of the group was donned in a dragon robe. Standing afar, he had an overbearing aura that was so mighty it was as though it could crush everything in the world.

“The Emperor of Central Dynasty…”

As the onlooker, Ye Qingtang’s brows were furrowed as she watched that man who was standing in the air. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Central Dynasty and Sacred Martial Academy were her archenemies. One day, she would still head to the Central Dynasty, and at that time… she would definitely erase their names from this world!

“Hand the Heart of the Demon God over.”

The Emperor of the Central Dynasty looked at the lady unsympathetically as though he was looking at a tiny ant.

Currently, the lady was already at a dead end.

“Hahaha, Ye Qingtang… I told you to be on your guard against Yu Qingqiu and the Sacred Martial Academy, but you didn’t listen. Do you regret it now!”

However, in this desperate situation, a cold laugh suddenly reverberated throughout the place!

Everyone looked at the sky immediately.

A giant ape descended from the sky and landed near the lady gradually. His huge frame guarded in front of the lady.

“Beidou Demon Lord of the demon clan?”

“Beidou Demon Lord, the number one talent of the ape clan’s descendants?”

Many onlookers discussed after seeing that giant ape.

“Brother…”

When Ye Qingtang saw the giant ape who protected the lady behind him, she shivered as the past memories floated to her mind.

In her previous life, Ye Qingtang finally became a Holy Venerate after three hundred years. In these three hundred years, she had a total of six sworn brothers, and this giant ape from the demon clan of the Central Dynasty was one of them. Addressed as Beidou Demon Lord by others, he was one of the ten top talents on this mainland and held a place on the Talent Roll.

“Beidou Demon Lord, could it be that you wish to take a share of the loot as well?” Yu Qingqiu looked at Beidou Demon Lord.

Beidou Demon Lord scoffed. “Ye Qingtang is my sworn younger sister. No matter how heartless I am, I will not attack my own sister.”

Seeming to hear the meaning behind Beidou Demon Lord’s words, a royal from the Central Dynasty said, “Beidou Demon Lord, this has nothing to do with you. It’s better not to get into trouble. Your demon clan and we, Central Dynasty royals, are already on bad terms. Do you still wish to deepen the conflict?”

“Haha.” Beidou Demon Lord laughed loudly out of a sudden. “I, Beidou Demon Lord, may be an ape from the demon clan, but I don’t represent the demon clan on this mainland. Today’s incident is solely my intention and has nothing to do with the demon clan.”

As the Beidou Demon Lord finished his sentence, his body enlarged instantly and extended several hundred meters. It was though he was a giant demon that covered the sky.

“Qingtang, leave!”

Immediately, the giant ape grabbed Ye Qingtang and sprinted forward.

Behind them was the pitch-black Dead Sea with a turbulent storm in the air above it.

The giant ape brought the lady and crossed into the Dead Sea.

Everyone present was appalled by the sight.

As Yu Qingqiu watched Beidou Demon Lord enter the black Dead Sea, she hollered furiously. “Beidou Demon Lord, are you crazy? That is the sea of death. No matter how powerful you are, you will still be torn into pieces by the turbulent storm once you enter the Dead Sea!”

“Hahaha…” Beidou Demon Lord laughed loudly. “Don’t you all want my sister’s Heart of the Demon God? Why? Are you all scared of this Dead Sea now?!”
