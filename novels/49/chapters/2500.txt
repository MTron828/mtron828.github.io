Seeing that everyone had already left, Ye Qingtang sighed with relief. They had just made it. They would be in great danger if they hadn’t.

But she suddenly saw something out of the corners of her eyes. The Blood Moon Elder was staring at her in surprise.

“What are you still doing here?” She looked at him and frowned. Why was he still here?

“Holy Lady… where should I be if not here?” He was confused and wasn’t sure what just happened, including where he currently was.

“Why didn’t you leave with them?” she asked.

“Holy Lady, not only do I not know them, I want to stay with you. Why would I follow them?” the Blood Moon Elder said as-a-matter-of-factly.

The corners of Ye Qingtang’s mouth twitched. She wanted to refute him but had no idea what to say.

“Hm, I got squeezed out just now. Or I would already have left,” the big yellow dog said unhappily.

Hearing its words, Ye Qingtang smiled and said, “Big yellow dog… you can’t leave. What am I supposed to do if you leave?”

“Me?” the Big yellow dog said as it looked at Ye Qingtang. “I hope you’re not thinking that I can help you deal with these human elders.”

“I believe in you. You will be able to do it,” she said.

The big yellow dog said, “You might believe in me but I don’t believe in myself. I think we should run away. They already sealed the exit and want to kill us… No, if I continue to follow you, will they not spare me as well?”

“I think that’s possible!” the Blood Moon Elder said as he nodded.

“Big yellow dog, what did you say the elders were doing?” Ye Qingtang asked.

The big yellow dog wagged his tail and looked upwards at the sky again.

“There seems to be a huge altar with the elders surrounding it and they look like they are doing a ceremony. One of them is looking at us. He says that a dog is looking at them…” the big yellow dog said.

Ye Qingtang was speechless. There was no need for it to say that last part.

“He’s also saying that his Lord is returning to that world soon and that the person in the Temple of Paragon should already be dead so it’s the best time to destroy it…” the big yellow dog continued.

But the information it was telling her this time was extremely important. Apart from the mention of the mysterious person they wanted to revive, they also mentioned the Temple of Paragon… Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Ye Qingtang pondered this and gradually realized the plot they had for the Wailing Well.

They were the ones behind it all in Universe City. The Wailing Well required fresh blood, so they had used the martial arts competition to transport people from various colleges into the Wailing Well. It seemed like they were also merely nourishment.

“Holy Lady, why do I feel that… this is a huge matter?” the Blood Moon Elder said as he looked at her.

Even though he wasn’t sure what exactly was happening, he could tell from their actions that this was a huge matter.

Ye Qingtang didn’t explain anything and merely looked up at the sky, lost in thought.

The elder that the big yellow dog was talking about had not appeared to care about finishing them off, which likely meant that they had more pressing concerns.

“Go.”

Ye Qingtang didn’t even turn back.

She had to seize this opportunity to save herself.
