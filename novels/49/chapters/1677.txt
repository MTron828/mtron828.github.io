Chapter 1678: Amazing (1)

Mu Ruxue’s eyes almost fell out of her head when she saw the distorted, swollen face in the reflection. Intermittent roars burst from her throat.

She had always treasured her looks and had never dreamt that she would one day appear in public looking so disgusting and ugly...

H-How dare she! Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Mu Ruxue struggled to free herself from Ye Qingtang. She seemed to go berserk and she covered her face tightly and peered at the contemptuous eyes looking at her from outside the arena. Then she screamed and fled the arena, half running, half crawling in her desperation.

How could this be...

Ye Qingtang should be the one in this state.

In the arena, Ye Qingtang had shattered Mu Ruxue’s arrogance inch by inch, and her dignity was in shreds.

Baili Xuanyun, who was seated on the platform, looked grim as he watched this scene unfold.

None of Ye Qingtang’s previous opponents were particularly powerful, and he had not heard from the Jiang family that she had any great ability. So they had secretly assumed that Ye Qingtang was weak and easily bullied. Who knew...

That a surprise like this would occur.

Mu Ruxue fled, which meant that she conceded the match. The winner of the match was clearly Ye Qingtang.

“Qingtang, you were amazing!” Jiang Yisheng’s eyes glowed as he watched Ye Qingtang leave the arena. He suddenly recalled how he had confidently given Ye Qingtang pointers on cultivation, and his cheeks flamed in embarrassment.

Embarrassing, so embarrassing. With Ye Qingtang’s abilities, why would she need his pointers?

All the Jiang family elders were gratified by this unexpected outcome. Elder Qian was surprised and delighted. He had not expected Ye Qingtang to improve so quickly. However... the joy of Elder Qian and the others was mingled with regret.

Ye Qingtang’s abilities had exceeded their expectations. Her abilities were considered above average in the Martial Arts Championship, but... she was still world’s apart from the other youths and the top ten from the last Martial Arts Championship.

All the top ten from the past championship were at the Fourth Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate realm.

Since Ye Qingtang had beaten Mu Ruxue, who was at the mid-stage of the Third Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate realm, she must be at least, at the peak of the last stage of the Third Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate realm. This was already a remarkable achievement, but she was still some distance away from being able to challenge the top ten.

“What a pity. If we had known earlier, we could have spent a little more effort on her, and she might have a chance of making it to the top ten.” Elder Kun could not help but sigh.

They had felt that the gap between Ye Qingtang and the others was too great, so they had not spent much effort on her. Now they could not help but regret their decision.

“Even if she’s at the peak of the Third Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate realm, it is extremely difficult to enter the Fourth Heaven. Although it is just a step away, how many talented youths have been stuck at that stage for decades, unable to advance?” Elder Qian sighed softly. He was both gratified and remorseful.

The closer a cultivator got to the Fifth Heaven, the harder it was to advance. They had seen many talented youths who were stuck at the peak of the Third Heaven for decades.

The elders who had initially overlooked Ye Qingtang could not help but feel regret.

Ye Qingtang had only just entered the Taiyuan Valley, but had managed to advance to this realm already. If she had not been lost in the first place, but trained in Taiyuan Valley since young, with her level of comprehension and her demonic Heavenly Demon Bloodline... the Jiang family would have raised another outstandingly talented disciple.
