Chapter 1919: Ming Di (1)

Ling Yan couldn’t help but laugh lightly when he heard the urgency in Ye Qingtang’s voice but proceeded to tell her everything he knew about Ming Di.

In terms of ranking, the Holy Son of the Temple of Shadows was second only to the Holy Lord of Shadows. But in terms of strength, the one closest to the Holy Lord of Shadows was Ming Di, which had terrorized the entire Central Mainland in the past.

Ming Di was a demonic dragon with an explosive temper and was extremely powerful. In fact, the Holy Lord of Shadows had been riding on Ming Di when she had first arrived in the Central Mainland.

These two extremely powerful beings had come together to push the Temple of Shadows to newfound heights.

Ming Di’s power was extremely terrifying and many strong men from the ancient clans had been unhappy about how arrogant it was at the start. But they had all been swallowed whole by Ming Di after confronting it.

If the Holy Lord of Shadows was the embodiment of power, then Ming Di was the embodiment of terror.

But after some time, Ming Di had vanished from the Central Mainland mysteriously.

“Why did the Holy Lord of Shadows want to seal Ming Di away if it was so strong?” Ye Qingtang found it extremely strange. She had no idea what the Holy Lord of Shadows was thinking.

“It was probably because they had different beliefs.”

“Different beliefs?”

“That’s right. The Holy Lord of Shadows wanted to take control over the entire Central Mainland but Ming Di’s personality was much more violent and it wanted to destroy everything. Rather than overtake the entire Central Mainland, Ming Di felt that it was more suitable to simply wipe everything out.

“Furthermore, Ming Di caused a lot of trouble on Central Road at that time, which caused the Temple of Shadows to have many enemies. As a result, all the major forces almost formed an alliance to oppose the Temple of Shadows, which was completely different from what the Holy Lord of Shadows had envisioned.”

“You know quite a lot about all of this.” Ye Qingtang felt like there was nothing Ling Yan didn’t know.

“Because it’s the information you need.”

Ye Qingtang had no words.

“Is Ming Di really that strong? So strong it could exchange blows with the Holy Lord of Shadows?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Even if it wasn’t the case, the difference in their strength was probably not great, or the Holy Lord of Shadows would have been able to suppress it fully, not just seal it away,” Ling Yan said.

Ye Qingtang was deliberating over Ling Yan’s words and was about to ask him about the Spirit of Chaos when she heard a sound from his side.

“Miss Ye, I have something I need to deal with. I speak with you later.” Without waiting for Ye Qingtang to respond, Ling Yan cut the connection.

Having been interrupted so abruptly, Ye Qingtang looked at the voice transmission stone in her hand with a complicated expression. Her thoughts wandered to Ming Di again. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Perhaps she could speak with Ming Gu.

Since she rarely called him, he rushed over excitedly when she did. Compared to the cautious Ming Wang, Ming Gu trusted her completely, so she took the chance to discreetly ask him about Ming Di.

Just as Ling Yan had said, the Holy Lord of Shadows had sealed Ming Di because its actions were too tyrannical. At the time, it had already made enemies of too many people in the Central Mainland. Ming Di did not believe in taking over the Central Mainland and only believed in wiping out all life instead.

It relished in the flames of destruction.

After many conflicts with the Holy Lord of Shadows and angering her multiple times, the Holy Lord of Shadows sealed Ming Di completely in the abyss prison of the Temple of Shadows.
