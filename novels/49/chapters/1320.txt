1321 Justice Before Family 2

When the Eldest Prince saw that the disaster relief trap had failed, he used the statuses of Meng Yi and the others to accuse General Mo. After all, everyone knew about Ling Yan and Mo Yunxian’s engagement.

When the Second Princess heard this, she also recovered her wits and said with a smile, “Did the Crown Prince not expose Meng Yi and the others because of his concerns about the Central Dynasty, or because they are General Mo’s trusted subordinates? No one can say for sure. After all, General Mo is one of the Crown Prince’s staunchest supporters. The Crown Prince only spoke up after the disaster relief matter was exposed. I wonder if he did so to protect himself.”

Ye Qingtang sighed softly as she heard the siblings work together seamlessly. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

These two were not utterly stupid They knew how to capitalize on the relationship between Ling Yan and the Mo Family.

But she was rather curious as to what Ling Yan would say this time.

“What my Second Royal Sister says makes sense. For some time now, General Mo has grown arrogant with his achievements. Even his daughter, Mo Yunxian, dared to make a scene in the Board of Punishments. She has no regard for heaven or the throne. I suppose General Mo also has his ambitions? Since the Crown Prince discovered this earlier, why didn’t he speak up?” The Eldest Princess also chipped in.

When Mo Yunxian saw her father being maligned, she said, “Don’t you malign my father and Elder Brother Yan! My father has always been loyal and has never disobeyed His Majesty. What Meng Yi and the others did has nothing to do with my father!”

“Elder Brother Yan, speak… Hasn’t my father always acted appropriately towards His Majesty?” Mo Yunxian asked Ling Yan urgently.

Ling Yan did not look at Mo Yunxian but looked directly at the Eternal Emperor and said, “Royal Father, I am guilty.”

The Eternal Emperor frowned slightly. He did not know why Ling Yan said he was guilty.

Ling Yan continued. “I discovered General Mo’s disloyalty long ago, but I did not speak because I had yet to gather sufficient evidence. Fortunately, I gathered sufficient evidence a few days ago, and I will now show it to my Royal Father.”

As he spoke, Ling Yan took a few memorials from his space ring and presented them to the Eternal Emperor.

These memorials clearly recorded all the crimes that General Mo had committed.

“I am engaged to the Mo Family, but I have never forgotten my own position,” Ling Yan said.

The entire court exploded into whispers.

For the past few years, General Mo’s behavior had become increasingly out of hand as his achievements on the battlefield grew. Many of the officials in the court were unhappy with this, but they did not dare to speak out because of the engagement between the Mo Family and Ling Yan and because of General Mo’s influence.

Everyone knew about the engagement between the Mo Family and Ling Yan. One might say that the Mo Family was Ling Yan’s greatest source of support.

No one expected Ling Yan to have the courage to put justice before family!

And accuse the Mo Family himself!

Mo Yunxian eyes widened as she stared at Ling Yan in disbelief.

She would never have dreamed that Ling Yan would accuse her family!

“Elder Brother Yan… you… what are you doing…” Mo Yunxian panicked.

Mo You and the others, who were nearby, also looked incredulous. They were Ling Yan’s trusted subordinates but had not known that Ling Yan was investigating the Mo Family.

When Ye Qingtang saw Ling Yan’s act of putting justice before family, she almost wanted to applaud him.

Ye Qingtang now understood why Ling Yan was not concerned about the trap that the Eldest Prince and Second Princess had set for him.
