Chapter 1632: Fight (1)

It looked as though some black blood from the bronze statue had splattered onto her while it was being gnawed on.

Ye Qingtang had not noticed it before, but now she felt a burning sensation on her shoulder where the black blood had spattered on her. She tore the clothing around her shoulder off. A palm-sized imprint appeared on her lily-white shoulder, looking as if it had been inscribed there. But it only briefly appeared before vanishing.

Ye Qingtang touched the area carefully, but there was no sensation. Her body did not feel any different.

“What was that?” Ye Qingtang frowned.

“The world in the nine-star constellation this time was quite interesting.” The radiant body seemed to have no intention of answering Ye Qingtang’s question. It had seen enough, so it flew away. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The radiant body wanted to know if Ye Qingtang intended to enter the next constellation world, but Ye Qingtang immediately refused. She bade farewell to the radiant body and then left the Illusory Void. She had a strange feeling about the inscription that had briefly appeared on her body.

She had spent a considerable amount of time in the two-star constellation this time, but when she emerged, she was startled to find that a month had gone past in the outside world...

She had spent much more time than in the one-star constellation world.

If she had not entered the nine-star constellation to cultivate for seven days, this month would have been utterly wasted.

Time in the constellation worlds flowed differently compared to the external world, but no one could be sure what the difference between the time in the two worlds was.

Fortunately, Ye Qingtang had only just entered Taiyuan Valley, and her abilities were mediocre, so she did not attract any attention. Her month-long disappearance went almost unnoticed.

Ye Qingtang returned to her room to change her clothes and got ready to go out and look for something to eat, but as she passed the central square, she heard a disturbance. She looked up and saw that several of the youths who usually hung out with Jiang Shaobai had formed part of a crowd.

“Ye Qingtang?” A youth who was hurrying in that direction was taken aback when he saw Ye Qingtang.

A month ago, Jiang Shaobai often went around with Ye Qingtang, so they recognized her. However, after not seeing her for a month, they were surprised to suddenly meet her now.

Ye Qingtang glanced at the youth and recognized him as Jiang Shaobai’s friend.

“You’re here just in time. Today is going to be fun. Let’s go, it’ll broaden your horizons.” The youth brooked no refusal and simply dragged Ye Qingtang into the crowd.

Two slender figures were fighting intensely in the center of the crowd.

One of them was a youth who frequently hung out with Jiang Shaobai. Ye Qingtang had met him a few times. His name was Jiang Yisheng.

Jiang Yisheng was fighting with ease. His handsome face was smiling. As his opponent fought, he saw an opening and seized the opportunity to land a punch, forcing the other youth’s head to the ground.

When they saw that Jiang Yisheng had won, the youths who usually trailed after Jiang Shaobai immediately cheered.

Jiang Yisheng saw that the youth he had forced to the ground looked resentful. He smiled and said, “Your abilities are so poor, you can’t even put up a good fight. Is there anyone among you who can fight? Call Jiang Yanyun. I’ll spar with him.”

Jiang Yisheng’s abilities were extraordinary. Among his companions, his abilities were second only to that little monster.

The youth whom Jiang Yanyun had forced to the ground was part of Jiang Yanyun’s clique.
