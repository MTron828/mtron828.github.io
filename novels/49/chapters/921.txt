Chapter 922 Faced With Beauty (3)

Ye Qingtang instinctively turned around. She was taken aback by what she saw.

A handsome man with an icy expression and absolutely emotionless eyes was standing quietly within her line of sight.

At a glance, Ye Qingtang recognized this man with a frosty cold demeanor.

“Since you have nothing with which to repay me, you should marry me.” Han Cangming slowly extended his hand to Ye Qingtang. He spoke coldly as his icy cold gaze fell on Ye Qingtang.

“Lord of the Antiquity Palace… Han Cangming?!”

Ye Qingtang’s whole body shuddered when she saw this ferocious and cold man.

How did she run into this fellow!

Ye Qingtang’s scalp prickled when she heard Han Cangming’s familiar “marry me”.

Ye Qingtang almost instinctively turned to flee. She was terrified that Han Cangming would see the Heart of the Demon God within her.

Just as Ye Qingtang turned to leave swiftly, a voice suddenly rang out from behind her.

“Miss Ye.”

Ye Qingtang paused, her foot just touching the threshold.

The voice behind her was completely different from the previous icy one. Instead, it seemed to contain infinite tenderness.

In a daze, Ye Qingtang turned slightly and looked behind her.

This glance stunned Ye Qingtang.

Han Cangming, who had been standing behind her, had vanished.

Instead, a man who was so handsome he looked like he had walked out of painting was standing there instead.

He stood there quietly, and his extraordinarily clever eyes looked at her smilingly.

“Ling Yan?”

Ye Qingtang stopped when she saw Ling Yan. Her expression showed a faint trace of bewilderment.

“Yes… it’s me.” Ling Yan nodded.

“What about Han Cangming?” Ye Qingtang asked in surprise. She clearly remembered seeing the Lord of the Antiquities Palace.

“Don’t know.” Ling Yan shook his head laughingly. He immediately extended his hand to Ye Qingtang and said, “Come.”

Ye Qingtang was rather puzzled, but she walked towards Ling Yan without thinking much about it.

After all, she and Ling Yan were friends.

“Where is this place? Why am I here? You… and why are you here…” Ye Qingtang’s expression grew increasingly puzzled. She momentarily could not recall what had happened.

Her mind seemed rather fuzzy. It was as if she was wanted to think of something, but she could not recall anything.

“Here?” Ling Yan looked around him. “Of course, this is a place for newly-weds.”

“Newly-weds?” Ye Qingtang was stunned. She studied her surroundings again and suddenly realized that the arrangements in the room had changed drastically.

The originally dim room was now brightly lit with red candles. The interior was hung with bright red silks, turning the entire room into a sea of bright red.

“You’re married? Who did you marry? Congratulations…” Ye Qingtang suddenly snapped out of her trance. She felt that something was amiss, but when she tried to pursue the thought, a voice in her mind seemed to tell her that this was the way things should be.

Ye Qingtang immediately opened her space ring. Since it was Ling Yan’s wedding day, of course, she had to congratulate him. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

She had originally thought of finding something in the space ring as a wedding present, but now, she realized that there was nothing in her space ring.

“I’m sorry, I came here in a hurry and didn’t bring a wedding present.” Ye Qingtang lifted her eyes with an apologetic look.

“You did bring one.” The corners of Ling Yan’s mouth turned up slightly. His half-smiling eyes slowly passed over Ye Qingtang’s entire body.
