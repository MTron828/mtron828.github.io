Chapter 1304: A Conspiracy (3)

“Elder Ye is right, but… our Third Royal Brother has always been intelligent and competent. He seldom does anything that displeases our Royal Father; otherwise… we would not be in this state,” the Eldest Prince said with a soft sigh.

“No matter how competent he is, he is unable to ensure that everyone around him is incorrupt…” Ye Qingtang said blandly.

Ye Qingtang’s words gave everyone a jolt. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Does Elder Ye mean… we should approach from the angle of the people that surround him?” The Second Princess asked tentatively.

Ye Qingtang rested her cheek on her face. She cocked her head slightly and looked at them.

“Everyone has their selfish desires. If you really want the Emperor to be displeased with Ling Yan, then find some problems that he or his subordinates face, enlarge them, and present them to the Emperor. If you do this a few times, it might not be effective. But after many times…”

Ye Qingtang did not complete her sentence. Everyone present was intelligent.

They all knew what Ye Qingtang was implying.

“If… we really can’t find anything?” The Second Princess asked again.

“If you are determined to condemn someone, a charge can always be found,” Ye Qingtang said with a soft laugh.

At that, the Second Princess and the Eldest Prince exchanged looks.

Considering their power, it would be easy for them to trump up a charge.

“Thank you Elder Ye for your guidance! We will go and make preparations.” The Eldest Prince cupped his fists in thanks.

The Second Princess also understood. She said farewell and hurried off to make her preparations.

Ye Qingtang’s emotions were in turmoil as she watched the three siblings hurry off to execute plans to harm Ling Yan…

When everyone left, Lady Ghost rose and said to Ye Qingtang, “The Holy Lord is truly wiser than everyone else. Just a suggestion of two, and they understood the crux of the matter.”

The Eldest Prince and the others had always been struggling to get rid of Ling Yan but had forgotten that the Eternal Emperor was crucial to Ling Yan’s status.

She did not wish to point it out either.

Ye Qingtang felt very depressed, but she needed to maintain her aloofness.

“Let’s see if they manage to pull it off…”

Lady Ghost laughed softly. “It is not important whether they can pull it off. As long as the Holy Lord is here, the Eldest Prince will certainly become the Crown Prince.”

Ye Qingtang did not say anything. She only glanced calmly at Lady Ghost, then rose, and went back to her room.

“Truly, women are the evilest…” The little white tiger muttered at Ye Qingtang’s back as it followed her back to her room.

Those princes and princesses had been in a mess, but Ye Qingtang had enlightened them.

She truly had not pulled her punches in dealing with Ling Yan.

“…” Ye Qingtang turned and glared at it.

What was she supposed to do?

There had clearly been an element of testing when Lady Ghost had thrown her the question.

With the Holy Lord of Shadows’s intelligence, surely she could not suggest some scheme that could easily be seen through?

If Ye Qingtang had made a perfunctory suggestion of what to do, then Lady Ghost would immediately become strongly suspicious of her identity. Then, she would certainly die, regardless of whether Ling Yan survived.

“Tell me, how do you think Ling Yan will react if he knew that you were doing your utmost to help others kill him?” The little white tiger waved its tail as it gloated.

Ye Qingtang simply kicked its furry butt and took out the voice transmission stone.
