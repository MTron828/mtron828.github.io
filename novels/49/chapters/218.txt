Zhou Xuan was stunned a little when Ye Qingtang suddenly spoke.

“Junior Sister Ye, there are three hundred skulls here. We need further investigation to understand the situation. You should not be so certain with your judgment. Our investigation is closely related to the three hundred lives here. We should examine every single skull. You cannot just conclude with a few sentences. Take this seriously.” Zhou Xuan sneered.

The other two disciples also showed unpleasant expressions. They would not believe that Ye Qingtang could investigate the three hundred skulls within such a short period of time and reach a conclusion.

Ye Qingtang smiled when the rest challenged her. Her white fingers swiped through the pus on the decayed flash. She forced open the mouth of the skull and pulled out the rotten tongue.

“Senior Brother Zhou, look carefully. Is there anything abnormal with the tongue?”

Zhou Xuan frowned as he felt disgusted by the rotten tongue. However, he did not show anything on his face and pretended to be calm. “Just a rotten tongue.”

Ye Qingtang chuckled and pulled out the dagger from her waist. She used the dagger to scale down a layer of mucus from the tongue and put it in front of Zhou Xuan. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Zhou Xuan almost vomited when he suddenly saw the disgusting mucus in front of his eyes.

“Senior Brother Zhou, the tongue is severely rotten indeed. But the residue of the Duanyuan Grass is well preserved.”

“Duanyuan Grass?” Zhou Xuan’s face changed. He controlled his impulse to vomit and took a closer look at the mucus.

It was true that there was some dark green plant residue among the mucus. The residue was very tiny, and it was easily neglected if one did not examine carefully.

“Duanyuan Grass is a type of poisonous grass grown at the edge of the cliff. It is not fatal, but it will cause people to faint within a short period of time. The person will lose all senses and will not wake up no matter how noisy the surroundings are.”

“Furthermore, it does not contain any smell. If it is crushed and put into tea, people will only treat it as tea leaves. No one will be able to detect that.”

Ye Qingtang smiled and explained.

“The night when the people of the Spirit Condensation Mountain Village were murdered was the village master Wu Chengze’s birthday celebration. They were busy for the whole night and were definitely exhausted in the morning. It’s absolutely normal for them to drink some tea to quench their thirst. However, the tea that was mixed with Duanyuan Grass was enough to make everyone in the village faint. I’m afraid they didn’t even know how they died when they were murdered.”

Ye Qingtang spoke slowly. However, Zhou Xuan and the rest were pale when they heard what she said.

They had noticed earlier that all the victims did not fight back before they were murdered. They suspected that someone poisoned them and tested the corpses with a silver needle. But the silver needle did not turn black.

They thought that their direction was wrong as even the most basic drug could turn the silver needle black.

They had never thought that the murderer would use Duanyuan Grass, which did not need any extraction processes.

Duanyuan Grass could make people faint, but it was not poisonous. Thus, no matter how they tried, they would have never found out the conclusion by using the silver needle. Furthermore, Duanyuan Grass was crushed to powder. If it entered the stomach and was mixed with the flesh, no one could find out anything!
