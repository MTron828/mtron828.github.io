Chapter 2401: All in One Shot (2)

Lei Yan and the rest of them looked on in shock at Ye Qing’s actions.

“Boss, you…”

She watched as the pink essence flowed into the water and instantly disappeared. “This flower is called the Sleeping Flower.”

“Sleeping Flower?” One of them asked in surprise.

“The flowers can numb the nervous system and make a person fall into a deep sleep.”

Lei Yan and the others instantly understood as Ye Qing said that.

“Boss, you’re using this to put all the demons to sleep?”

She nodded.

They were all getting excited.

But Song Yanhan spoke coldly. “Teacher Ye, are you kidding me? This lake is huge, and these demons aren’t normal humans. How can this little essence…”

But before he could finish his sentence, deep snores came from the lake. In an instant, the demons drinking water at the lake collapsed without warning.

And the other demons drinking at the lake quickly followed suit.

The demons collapsed so quickly that no one even had time to react.

“But… but…” Song Yanhan looked at the demons in confusion. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“How… how is that possible?”

His eyes widened in disbelief, as though he had just witnessed an illusion.

Collapsed?

They had all collapsed?

What kind of joke was this!

These were all demons possessing Divine Lord level power?

And yet they had been put to sleep by that little essence?

Even Lei Yan and the rest were stunned.

This was way too fast!

“B… boss… th… this is all from the essence of those flowers?” Lei Yan stuttered in surprise.

They had thought that the effects of the essence would be diminished in such a large lake and would only take out a few demons at most.

But…

“Sleeping Flowers are extremely rare, and you don’t really see them outside. Just one-third of a petal is enough to put an entire city to sleep,” Ye Qingtang said lightly.

She hadn’t recognized the flowers at first and had only noticed them after seeing the demons avoid the flower.

After all…

Sleeping Flowers were extremely rare and just one of them could fetch the same price as a Grand Master-level pill.

These flowers were the things of legends.

Who knew that they would be growing in droves here.

It wasn’t a coincidence that all the demons were avoiding it. They knew the effects of the flowers and were avoiding them on purpose.

“Yes… yes… we’ve finally struck the jackpot…”Nangong Lie clutched his chest as he looked at the demons at the lake. He was so excited that he couldn’t breathe properly.

“What are you standing there for? Go.” Ye Qing looked at them expectantly.

With that, they leaped into action and rushed towards their ‘present’.

Outside the Wailing Well…

Wen Qi looked on as Lei Yan and the others cut off the demons’ heads like turnips. His expression was subtle. Beside him were teachers from the other academies.

The shock in their expressions was mirrored across them all.
