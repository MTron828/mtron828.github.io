Chapter 780 Putting On A Complete Show (3)

For a moment…

The entire hall was dead silent, and everyone looked at Ye Qingtang with a serious expression.

Ye Qingtang was emotionless, but she took in everyone’s reaction.

The Full Moon Peak Peak Master frowned deeply. He never thought that this Ye Chen seemed to be related to the legendary hidden clans.

Even Perfected Xuanchen was slightly taken aback. He originally planned to reduce Ye Qingtang’s punishment in secret and never thought that… this fellow’s identity did not seem to be so simple.

“Full Moon Peak Peak Master, how do you think this matter should be settled?” Perfected Xuanchen returned to his senses and asked the Full Moon Peak Peak Master, who was ready to bite off Ye Qingtang’s nose just a while ago.

The Full Moon Peak Peak Master’s face stiffened.

Ye Qingtang was from a dubious background and possessed shocking skills. Her family clan had an abundance of resources, and she even dared to go against the Peerless School.

The Full Moon Peak Peak Master was rather convinced. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

If Ye Qingtang was really a member of a hidden clan, how could he lay a finger on her so easily?

“We will discuss this matter next time…” the Full Moon Peak Peak Master said with consideration as he still needed to investigate Ye Qingtang’s background before he could punish her.

Xuanyuan Lie was in a daze. He originally thought that Ye Qingtang would die without a doubt this time, yet why did his grandfather suddenly change his stance?

What exactly was the sea of clouds at Mount Qin?

Perfected Xuanchen nodded slightly and looked up at Ye Qingtang. “Ye Chen, you can return first.”

Ye Qingtang lifted her hands and greeted Perfected Xuanchen before leaving the hall with Yin Qingluo.

Just after they left the hall, Yin Qingluo sighed heavily.

“Junior Brother Ye, today was really too thrilling. When you attacked the Peerless School envoys just now, I was really shocked.”

Ye Qingtang smiled faintly without saying anything.

If she did not retaliate just now, given the Peerless School disciples’ arrogance, both she and Yin Qingluo would probably have been killed by them.

It was just that…

This measure could only deal with the emergency at the moment.

Regardless of the Peerless School or Falling Sky Valley, both did not take any further action as they were apprehensive about the hidden clans. But as long as they investigated this matter, they could find out the loopholes in it.

Ye Qingtang only avoided trouble temporarily. When the Full Moon Peak Peak Master finds out that she was not from the hidden clans, that would be the true disaster.

She could tell that Perfected Xuanchen had the intention of protecting her just now.

If she could not deal with the Full Moon Peak Peak Master and the rest then, Perfected Xuanchen would be unable to protect her safety either.

Furthermore…

She did not intend to flee.

If she fled, her Master and her fellow disciples would go through the same tragedy in her previous life.

Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes. At this very moment, she desperately needed to raise her skills as soon as possible. She could resolve everything only by stepping into the Yin Yang Perfected Lord state.

She still had a bottle of Black Heaven Water in her hands that she had not used.

However, it was insufficient to only rely on the Black Heaven Water.

“Senior Sister Yin, I still have something on. You can return first.” Ye Qingtang told Yin Qingluo.

It was time for her to explore the Dragon Vein with Master Du.

If she could attain advancements in the Dragon Vein, it would be the best.

Yin Qingluo did not probe and left after bidding goodbye to Ye Qingtang.

After returning to her room, Ye Qingtang brought the little white tiger and the silver wolf with her before leaving Falling Sky Valley and heading to the central area of the monarch city.

At this time in Ouyang family clan, the Blood Moon Elder had passed off as Ouyang Qian for half a month, and it could be said that he was in his element there. Apart from the occasional grievance of being a lady, with the identity of Ouyang family clan’s favorite child, he had anything he wanted and lived blissfully.
