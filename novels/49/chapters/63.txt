Chapter 64: The Birthday Banquet (1)

Ye Ling was doubtful at first, but because Ye Qingtang had claimed that her spirit root was accidentally shattered, he did not pry much into the matter.

“Maybe I’m just over-thinking.”

Though having said that, the Second Elder still lamented the loss of Ye Qingtang’s spirit root.

Not only was her spirit root verdurous, she was pretty talented in martial prowess as well. If her spirit root was still intact, she would have had a bright future ahead of her.

Ye Qingtang approached them while they were discussing the matter. Though it was supposed to be a joyous day for the Ye household, none other than the Great Elder’s associates felt like celebrating.

Since the Great Elder was the star of the day, the three of them could get to sit back and relax.

“Father, Uncle. I’ve just smuggled these from the kitchen. Wanna grab a bite?” Ye Qingtang grinned merrily while she offered some snacks to Ye Ling and the Second Elder.

She was touched by their concerns when she overheard their conversation.

However, till now, she had not revealed the truth to the both of them. She had to prevent them from starting a direct skirmish with the Great Elder out of blind fury that might jeopardize her plans. Certain problems could be better resolved if tackled on her own.

“Sure.” Ye Ling and the Second Elder smiled in return.

Ye Qingtang indulged herself in the snacks as well, while she watched with a grin, the Great Elder basking in the guests’ compliments.

Tonight, the Great Elder received the guests with a ruddy complexion, that even smothered his usual menacing countenance.

“Great Elder, you’re indeed fortunate to have such a talented granddaughter. It’s a blessing that others could never hope to attain in their lifetime. Now that she had even joined the Cloud-breakers, you can only imagine the number of people that are green with envy.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Though the Great Elder’s features remained impassive, he was actually rather pleased with the compliments.

“Xiao-You’s still young, and a mere rookie in the Cloud-breakers. She’s just lucky to earn the Sovereign’s affection. I can only hope for the best in her endeavors.”

“You’re far too modest. The Cloud-breakers is prestigious even amongst the Exalted clans and not just anyone can make it in. She’s definitely the cream of the crop.”

“That’s right. To be recruited by the Sovereign personally, not anyone can get this chance of a lifetime!”

News of Ye You being recruited by the Cloud-breakers was long circulated amongst the common rabble in the city. Everyone knew just how powerful the Cloud-breakers were and they could only regard Ye You’s fortune with envy. However, many understood the fact that not anyone could come to possess a verdurous spirit root like hers.

The Great Elder finally broke into a faint smile, after hearing all those compliments.

“Grandpa, Duan-lang’s here to present his well-wishes on behalf of the Duan household.” Ye Xun, who was the sole organizer for the whole birthday banquet, led the well-attired Duan Tianrao into the main hall.

“A happy birthday to you, Great Elder. May you be blessed with the best and your days as happy as today. Here’s some gifts from my family, specially prepared for you.” Duan Tianrao gave his regards with a beaming smile on his face, while his attendants presented the gifts, before stacking them onto the table beside the Great Elder.

“Many thanks for the gifts. Please give my regards to your father as well.” The Great Elder nodded his head in appreciation, before turning his attention towards Ye Xun.

“Xun-er, I’ve heard you’re reaching the cultivation level of an innate stage six. Is that true?”

Ye Xun put on a faint smile and said: “Yes Grandpa. Most probably in a month’s time.”

“Not bad.” The Great Elder nodded, seemingly pleased with her progress.

“Though Xun-er’s not as talented as Sis, but as the saying goes, practice makes perfect. I can only hope that, with rigorous training, I may be able to achieve a standard that doesn’t let Grandpa down.” Ye Xun clearly understood that her own spirit root could neither be on par with Ye Qingtang’s previously, nor Ye You’s current one. But, she had her own plans.
