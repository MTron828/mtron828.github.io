Chapter 2070: Strange (2)

Ye Qingtang looked at the man in front of her in bewilderment.

He wanted to challenge her?!

Ye Qingtang was speechless. She didn’t even know who he was. This was their first time interacting.

And their first proper introduction...

Was it going to be a challenge?

Ye Qingtang simply couldn’t comprehend what was going on in his head.

“Since you’re Mi’s friend, you’re a guest at the Temple of Shadows. I don’t have any reason to fight with you.” Ye Qingtang replied coldly.

What kind of joke was this?

Judging from how Mi treated him the previous time, she could already tell that he was a force to be reckoned with. Even Ye Qingtang couldn’t tell what level he was at with her current powers, he must be much more powerful than her.

Though Ye Qingtang had remarkable improvements recently, she wasn’t daring enough to fight with a strong power from the Second Domain.

The man was slightly dissatisfied when faced with her rejection, and it showed in how he knitted his brows.

Ye Qingtang didn’t want to continue entertaining him. Wasn’t this too strange? Who on earth would approach someone for a challenge as an introduction?

Wasting no time, she moved to leave but just as she stepped forward, she felt a gust of chilly air from behind.

It was overbearing, even more so than Mi. Ye Qingtang was alarmed. Whoosh! She instantly dodged.

Right when Ye Qingtang flew up, a beam of light flashed past the spot she originally stood at and pierced through the wall in the Temple of Shadows.

Boom! A huge crack appeared in the wall.

Ye Qingtang was speechless.

The walls in the Temple of Shadows were built with special materials. It would take at least three days of continuous bombing by tens of Holy Venerates to cause a crack in the wall...

This man... did that with a single move?

Being shocked was an understatement.

“Holy Lord, please don’t be humble. This is a rare opportunity, why won’t you just take up the challenge.” The man was devoid of emotion and the moment he said that he struck another move towards Ye Qingtang.

This speed was inhuman. He was so quick that Ye Qingtang couldn’t see anything.

Ye Qingtang couldn’t even keep track of his shadow. She suddenly felt a twinge in her shoulder and flew away from the impact, spitting a mouthful of blood.

He was so powerful! Even more powerful than anyone she had ever met!

Ye Qingtang could only suffer and broke out into a cold sweat.

It seemed like he wasn’t going to make any further move. He merely looked at Ye Qingtang with his brows furrowed and with a complicated expression.

Ye Qingtang was stunned.

She had improved, but she was nowhere as good as the real Holy Lord of Shadows.

This man could tell.

Ye Qingtang couldn’t help but feel uneasy when she recalled that the man was friends with Mi.

Before Ye Qingtang could do anything, the man left without a word. After stepping out of the temple, he simply vanished. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Like that Ye Qingtang was left behind, feeling confused.

This man...

What did he want?

He wanted to challenge her but just left after striking one move?

Were strong beings from the Second Domain all strange like that?

Although she had no idea what his motive was, she could not allow herself to let her guard down. Cleaning up after the impromptu confrontation, she went to look for Mi.
