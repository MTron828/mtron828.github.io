Chapter 1136: Protect (2)

“Don’t be shocked… I share the same memory as my split self. I feel the same… as how he feels to you…” The virtual elderly sighed.

Ye Qingtang was a Holy Venerate in her previous life, and she naturally knew that the split self’s senses, emotions, and even memory could be shared with the original self. Plainly speaking, the Blood Moon Elder and this elderly were actually the same person.

“Holy Lady… fighting alongside you over this period of time is a rare experience…” The virtual elderly continued saying. “Especially when I tried being a lady… However… no matter what, you must die… Being alive in itself… is a cruel thing for you…”

“What are you trying to say?” Ye Qingtang looked at that elderly questioningly as she felt that he seemed to know something.

“You’re merely taking that old route once again. It was with Heavenly Emperor in the last life… perhaps it is the Demon God this lifetime… However, you won’t have any good outcome regardless… Instead of suffering endless torment and then dying, why not… die earlier…” The virtual elderly said.

Demon God?!

Ye Qingtang was startled when she heard the elderly mention the Demon God.

She had no relations with the Demon God originally, but because of the heart in her body that was known by everyone as the Heart of the Demon God, everyone was after her life throughout her entire previous life.

Now, this elderly mentioned the Demon God and seemed to imply that she had some connections with the Demon God.

Ye Qingtang found it bizarre.

However…

Ye Qingtang took a deep breath and scoffed.

“What a joke. What is meant by a cycle and taking the old route? I don’t know what you’re saying, but there is one thing that I am very clear of…”

Ye Qingtang looked up slightly. Her eyes were determined and bright.

“My life is in my own hands. No one shall think of controlling my fate!”

The elderly in the air shook his head.

Actually, the elderly was unaware of what exactly happened to Ye Qingtang and merely trusted the Heavenly Emperor unconditionally.

Since the Heavenly Emperor wanted her life, he must have his own reasons.

In the eyes of the elderly, the Heavenly Emperor’s words were the only truth in this world.

Regardless of the reason behind the Heavenly Emperor’s actions, the elderly would support him unconditionally. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Alright. Since you insist on protecting this split self, so be it then.” The elderly sized up Ye Qingtang and disappeared slowly until he was completely gone.

His mental energy was almost depleted, and this virtual image could no longer be sustained; thus, he could only leave for now.

When he noticed that the elderly disappeared, the tensed-up Blood Moon Elder finally sighed in relief although it was evident that he still had not recovered from the shock. He turned to look at Ye Qingtang in gratitude and spoke.

“Thank you… Thank you Holy Lady…”

Seeing that the elderly had left, Ye Qingtang removed her hand from the Blood Moon Elder’s shoulder. The serious expression in her eyes faded away and was replaced by a meaningful look as she sized up the Blood Moon Elder.

“I never thought that… you’re actually a split self.”

The Blood Moon Elder froze when he heard Ye Qingtang and replied immediately.

“Although… Although I am a split self… I’ve long forgotten that I am a split self already. I think that I should be the original self.”

“Unless you can personally kill him as you said just now… Otherwise, you will always be a split self.” Ye Qingtang discouraged the Blood Moon Elder bluntly.
