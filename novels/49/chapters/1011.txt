Chapter 1012 Prosperity (2)

The Third Elder settled down the two elders in the main hall of the Ye residence.

“Third Elder… Where… Where did you find these powerful figures?” The Great Elder looked at the Third Elder in astonishment.

Yin Yang Perfected Lord Third Heaven and peak of Second Heaven were already considered a sect stabilizer even in super sects. It was simply hard to catch the eye of such people normally. How did Third Elder find these two people and even bring them back to the Ye Family…

Third Elder cackled proudly. “With Eldest Young Lady’s will energy, do I still need to find them?”

“What do you mean?” The Great Elder did not understand.

“At the borders of the Formidable Heavens Dynasty, I actively emitted Eldest Young Lady’s will energy. Those martial cultivators who had not reached the Yin Yang Perfected Lord realm were scared out of their pants and did not even dare to come near to where I was. However, several Yin Yang Perfected Lords felt the will energy of Eldest Young Lady and came over in curiosity… I took a fancy on these two powerful figures immediately and explained the situation to them…” The Third Elder laughed.

The Great Elder’s lips twitched slightly after hearing the Third Elder’s explanation. This Third Elder’s ambitions are really great. He actually actively released Eldest Young Lady’s will energy in order to attract the Yin Yang Perfected Lord figures over.

“There were six or seven Yin Yang Perfected Lords who came in total. After knowing that a Yang Lord was recruiting people into her clan… all of them requested to join…” The Third Elder continued with his explanation. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Then… Why are there only two people here? What about the remaining ones?” The Great Elder was very agitated and asked hurriedly.

“Remaining ones?” The Third Elder frowned slightly. “They were all chased away by those two elderlies… They are the most powerful, and other Yin Yang Perfected Lords did not dare to say anything…”

The Great Elder was speechless.

Just as the Great Elder and the Third Elder were chatting, Ye Ling rushed over with the Second Elder and Ye Qingtang.

After understanding the details of the situation, Ye Ling questioned. “What is the background of those two elders?”

“One of them is Formidable Heavens Dynasty’s Grand Imperial Sire, Bai Kui, while the other is an itinerant cultivator known as Daoist Zijin.” Third Elder replied honestly.

“Daoist Zijin… Formidable Heavens Dynasty’s Grand Imperial Sire, Bai Kui?!”

Apart from Ye Qingtang, everyone else gasped after knowing the identity of those two people.

Both Daoist Zijin and Bai Kui were immensely reputable, especially Bai Kui, the Grand Imperial Sire of Formidable Heavens Dynasty, who had once been a warden of the Beiming Manor. However, something seemed to have happened, and he was expelled from Beiming Manor.

As for Daoist Zijin, he had quite a reputation as he single-handedly challenged a super sect decades ago.

“Let’s go in and take a look,” said Ye Qingtang.

Then, Ye Qingtang had already walked straight into the main hall.

Daoist Zijin and Bai Kui each took one side of the hall. Their brows furrowed slightly when they saw a young girl entering the hall.

Ye Ling, the Third Elder and the rest knew their place and did not follow Ye Qingtang into the hall. After all, it was better to have fewer people present in a meeting among the few Yin Yang Perfected Lords.

Ye Qingtang settled down at the central seat of the hall and looked at Bai Kui and Daoist Zijin. “I’m already aware of your identities. Do you really wish to join my Ye Family?”

After hearing that, Daoist Zijin said indifferently, “Let your clan’s Yang Lord come and talk to us.”
