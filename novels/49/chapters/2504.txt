“What are you muttering about? Are you done?” Every time she tried to make contact with the Deity Ocean, there would be this dog and person interrupting her, which was making her impatient.

Seeing that she was getting irritated, the big yellow dog and the Blood Moon Elder looked at each other. Even though they wanted to say more, they decided to shut their mouths in the end.

Seeing that the big yellow dog and the blood moon elder were finally not running their mouths anymore, Ye Qingtang shut her eyes and concentrated hard on making contact with the Deity Ocean.

“It’s coming, it’s coming…” in the time span of a few breaths, the Blood Moon Elder noticed that the demon palm was only a few hundred meters away from them. They would be trapped in just one more breath.

As soon as the words were out of the blood moon elder’s mouth, Ye Qingtang opened her eyes and a clear cold light shone from them.

“How?” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

She was shocked. She had clearly made contact with the Deity Ocean but why was she still in the Wailing Well and not within the Deity Ocean space? How was this possible?

There was no time for her to think. The demon palm was already in front of her. There would be no time to make contact with the Deity Ocean again.

But just as she thought that their lives were over, the demon palm paused right in front of their very eyes, as though it had lost its target. It started swinging back and forth, as though searching for something.

“Hm?” Confusion filled the Blood Moon Elder’s face. What was happening to the demon palm? Was it showing mercy and letting them go? But how was that possible?

“Could it be…”

Ye Qingtang pondered.

She knew that the Deity Ocean within her body had two kinds of power.

The first was that whenever she made contact with it, she could enter the Deity Ocean space. The second ability had almost already been forgotten by her, but it still existed.

The Divine Concealment Spell…

It allowed them to completely conceal their aura as well as their bodies. But this power had only revealed itself once before and had never worked about after that.

The sudden appearance of this spell surprised her.

She had already expected to enter the Deity Ocean space as long as she contacted it and had completely forgotten that it had the power to conceal as well.

“Holy Lady, why has the demon palm stopped?” the Blood Moon Elder looked at her in confusion.

“This is the Divine Concealment Spell,” the big yellow dog said.

“Divine Concealment Spell? What does that mean?” the Blood Moon Elder said as he regained his senses.

“It means that we are concealed and no one can see us,” the big yellow dog explained.

“Concealed?” The Blood Moon Elder found this hard to believe and looked down at himself. “That’s not true… I can still see myself. I can see you and the Holy Lady as well…”

The big yellow dog threw a glance at him and said, “I don’t feel like speaking to you, please shut up.”

Ye Qingtang ignored both of them and was in deep thought. She knew that she could bring people into the Deity Ocean space but didn’t think that she would be able to use the Divine Concealment Spell on the people around her as well.

She seemed to be thinking of something as she looked at the Blood Moon Elder. Her eyes swiveled to her hand on him and quickly darted away again.

In the next second, the Holy Lady and big yellow dog standing in front of the Blood Moon Elder vanished, leaving only himself.
