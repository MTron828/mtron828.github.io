Chapter 1608: Fight The War (2)

The King was dumbfounded for a moment, but he recalled the new Kingdom Knight he conferred some time ago.

The reason he granted Ye Qingtang the Kingdom Knight title was not because he acknowledged Ye Qingtang’s skills but to boost the army morale. Yet, Joseph suddenly suggested letting Ye Qingtang fight the war and lead the army, and this caused the Emperor to frown slightly.

Joseph and the others had been dissatisfied with Ye Qingtang for a long time. Adding the fact that she just injured their fellow brother Toby, right now, they could not wait to send Ye Qingtang onto a battlefield with thousands of enemy forces and let her fend for herself.

If the King required them to win against the allied forces, they would not joke about such a matter, but if it was only to buy time, there was nothing wrong with sending Ye Qingtang.

Wasn’t the so-called buying time just using lives to exchange for time?

If the outcome was death, of course, the most suitable choice was to sacrifice the most useless parasite.

The King hesitated as well. He currently needed some way to endure the first wave of attack, and they would only fight it out with the allied forces after the reinforcements arrived and joined in the war a while later.

“Your Majesty, we just sparred with Ye Qingtang on the field earlier on, and Tang is very skilled. I believe she came to the fortress and became a Kingdom Knight to attain glory for the kingdom. Your Majesty, why don’t you give Tang a chance and let her display her ambition?” In order to screw Ye Qingtang badly, Joseph recommended her strongly without scruples of going against his heart to praise her skills.

The other Kingdom Knights shared the same thoughts and agreed that Ye Qingtang was the most suitable candidate for this war without Joseph having to tell them anything.

The little white tiger made a gagging action when it heard this group of people echoing off each other.

“They’re really going all out to screw you this time.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Ye Qingtang did not utter a word.

After remaining silent for a while, the King suddenly said, “Tang, are you confident you can fight this war?”

Everyone at the scene was very clear that buying time was basically throwing one’s life away. In order to retain their strength, it was impossible to deploy too many forces as the King naturally also wished to retain his elite forces.

The moment the King spoke, everyone’s eyes landed on Ye Qingtang, and Joseph and the others looked at her in a satirical manner.

Ye Qingtang walked forward slowly under everyone’s watch.

“Your Majesty, I am willing to fight the war.”

Smiles filled Joseph’s eyes instantly.

“Very well.” The King nodded in satisfaction and immediately deployed 10,000 soldiers to fight along Ye Qingtang. Ye Qingtang received the order and made the necessary preparations at once.

Meanwhile, Joseph and the rest left the hall in smiles as they looked at Ye Qingtang like she was a dead person.

“She’s so bold to accept it. Is she really treating fighting a war as playing house?”

“She has not even been on a battlefield before. What does she know? Over the past few days, she hid behind us and enjoyed herself for a long time. It’s time for her to know the cruelty of war.”

“10,000 against 500,000. I think her entire corpse won’t even be found.”

“Who cares how she dies? Just a while longer, and the reinforcements will arrive. By then, we will lead the troops and fight our way out.”

The Kingdom Knight chatted and roared with laughter. In their eyes, Ye Qingtang was just an ignorant fool, and leaving the city to fight the war now was just welcoming death.
