Chapter 2689: Mysterious Land (1)

A moment later, they descended from the sky and finally arrived on land. Xie Jun sized up the dilapidated ancient city in front of him with a puzzled expression.

“Why is there an ancient city here?” Lan Shan asked.

“It’s a little strange,” Wan Rong said softly. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Actually, it’s nothing much.” One of the other Great Immortal Temple disciples commented. “If this is really the Fourth Domain, it should be no different from the other three domains. This ancient city must have been a city in the Fourth Domain but after the Fourth Domain was destroyed, it became a dead city. This is reasonable, right?”

Everyone looked at each other. That made sense.

“Be careful. There might be disciples from the other supreme factions nearby,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Hehe, who knows, they might have all fallen into a volcano and burned to ashes after they entered the void rift.” Lan Shan smiled.

Ye Qingtang, “…”

It had to be said that Senior Brother Lan Shan was a truly vicious character… To think that he could so happily curse someone who had never wronged him to fall into a volcano.

“It’s better to be careful. I keep feeling that this place is a little strange,” said Xie Jun from the side.

“Junior Sister Ye Yue, you decide. Are we entering this ancient city or not…? Otherwise, I have an idea. We will directly find the disciples of the supreme factions and force them to search for the Paragon relic. After they find it, we will snatch it from them. If they dare to resist, we will kill them all. What do you think?” A purple-haired youth suggested with a smile.

Ye Qingtang, “…”

From the looks of it, the Absolute Heaven Saint had good foresight. If he were to let these disciples act alone, even if they obtained the Paragon Relic, the major factions of the Divine Venerate Domain would band together to cause trouble for the Great Immortal Temple.

In this era, there was no such thing as good or evil. The meaning of the words “justice” and “reason” was decided by the supreme factions.

Regardless of whether you were evil or good, whether you cultivated demonic techniques or not, strength was everything. As long as you were not an obstacle to the majority of the supreme factions, no one would punish you.

“Forget it.” Ye Qingtang looked at the purple-haired young man. “Senior Brother Zhou Yun, if we follow your plan, I’m afraid that even before we see the Paragon Relic, the disciples of those supreme factions will join forces and eliminate us all.”

“Junior Sister Ye Yue is right.” Wan Rong nodded. “The Dragon Emperor Clan has several peak Heaven Emperor level practitioners. The Heavenly Saint Cult has a practitioner who is just half a step away from the Immortal Emperor level. The Heavenly Demon Clan has a sub-Immortal Emperor… and Mo Wen, the number one junior of the Sky Cult… has already reached the Immortal Emperor stage.”

At the mention of Mo Wen, the expressions of everyone from the Great Immortal Temple changed slightly. Mo Wen… was known as a demon-level genius of the Divine Venerate Domain. Among every cultivator in the entire Divine Venerate Domain under the age of 300, Mo Wen would definitely be ranked within the top five.

After becoming an Immortal Emperor, one could comprehend the powers of heaven and earth, the powers of nature and even the realm of gods…

Among the younger generation of the Divine Venerate Domain, there were very few who could eventually reach the Immortal Emperor Stage. Mo Wen was one of them.

“Indeed. Uncle-Master Absolute Heaven Saint said that Mo Wen would also enter the void rift and asked us to be especially careful. It’s best not to have any contact with him.” Lan Shan nodded.
