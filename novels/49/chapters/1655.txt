Chapter 1656: Drawing Lots (3)

Although they were worried, they knew perfectly well that with Ye Qingtang’s talent and skills, it would be next to impossible for her to win a round in the Martial Arts Championship.

Jiang Yisheng and the others encouraged Ye Qingtang, then began preparing for their own matches.

Because there were more people participating in the competition this time, they had to compete in batches. Ye Qingtang was in the first round of the last batch. She could still observe other matches in the arena before her own match.

Jiang Yiran was in the first batch that entered the arena. Because Jiang Shaobai had misled him, Jiang Yiran entered the arena with a heavy heart. But when he saw that his opponent was not Jiang Shaobai, his tense expression immediately relaxed.

Within moments, Jiang Yiran realized that Jiang Shaobai had tricked him and a mottled fury appeared on his face. He immediately vented his anger on his opponent. Their skills were somewhat disparate, and with Jiang Yiran giving it his all, the youth was soon circling the arena blindly and he lost shortly thereafter.

The other youths from the Jiang Family entered the arena one after another. Ye Qingtang had intended to look for Jiang Shaobai to watch her match, but the crowd was surging around her and she did not manage to find Jiang Shaobai. Instead, she watched Jiang Yanyun enter the arena.

As the Jiang Family’s most talented and powerful youth, Jiang Yanyun’s skills were not to be underestimated. The youth opposing him seemed unable to make a single move before Jiang Yanyun’s series of actions sent him flying from the arena.

Elder Qian and the others smiled contentedly at Jiang Yanyun’s performance.

But before Elder Qian and the others could finish basking, another thunderous roar sounded from the arena.

They looked at the arena and saw that a bolt of lightning had sent a youth flying. Qiu Chen stood in the huge arena, surrounded by blue lightning. He was sneering as he observed the crowd with arrogance written all over his face.

“That fellow from the Qiu Family is quite formidable...” Elder Qian and the others frowned deeply.

“Qiu Chen and Qiu Heyang have always been exceptionally talented. In addition, the Qiu Family has spent a lot of effort in training them. I wonder how many trump cards they still have in their hand.” Elder Kun also looked worried.

The Qiu Family and the Jiang Family had never gotten along well. This time, the Qiu Family was clearly out to suppress the Jiang Family.

The Qiu Family had come in second in the last Martial Arts Championship. If that person had not passed the twenty-five year mark, he would have been sitting among the top ten.

“Shaobai...” Elder Kun asked meaningfully.

Elder Qian nodded and they did not say anymore.

At that moment, the Elder from the Qiu Family walked over slowly, to the congratulations of the other ancient clans. He looked at the Jiang Family elders.

“Elder Qian, what do you think of our Qiu Chen’s Thundercloud Fists?” Elder Qian walked over. Although he was smiling, his expression was provocative.

Elder Qian frowned slightly, but maintained his composure. “The Qiu Family’s Thundercloud Fists have always been formidable. Elder Qiu must have spent a lot of time and effort training him.”

“I didn’t spend much effort. Qiu Chen only practiced the Thundercloud Fists for half a year. It was just for him to train his arm strength, but his powers of comprehension were so great that he managed to reach the Fifth Heaven without much effort,” Elder Qiu said with a laugh.

He had reached the Fifth Heaven after training for half a year? What a boast!

In his heart, Elder Qian smiled frostily but kept his expression neutral. If Elder Qiu was not exaggerating, then Qiu Chen must be extraordinarily talented.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m
