Chapter 2497: Underground Demon God (7)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The big yellow dog’s words of contempt seemed to have instantly thrown the Blood Moon Elder into a bottomless abyss. He could not believe that not only was his strength inferior to a dog but he was also looked down upon by a dog…

What was the point of his life? He was begging to be sworn brothers with a dog and had only been rejected.

No one would believe him even if he told them.

“I won’t force you if you don’t want to go to the Second Domain,” Ye Qingtang said without giving the Blood Moon Elder a chance to continue talking nonsense with the big yellow dog.

The Blood Moon Elder was slightly stunned and did not understand what Ye Qingtang meant.

“The Second Domain is different from the First Domain. There are many unknowns and it is even more dangerous. You have already died for me once and I do not wish that to happen a second time,” Ye Qingtang said after pondering for a moment.

Ye Qingtang was speaking the truth. Especially given the current state of the Blood Moon Elder, he could not even protect himself in the Second Domain.

In fact, it was not just the Blood Moon Elder. She was the same as well. Even she could not guarantee her own safety in the Second Domain.

“Holy Lady…”

The Blood Moon Elder gritted his teeth.

Ye Qingtang looked at the Blood Moon Elder thoughtfully. “Actually, you are right. In the First Domain, you can do whatever you want but in the Second Domain, you will meet with all kinds of unknown dangers. You have been by my side for so long and I know how loyal you are to me. Let’s do this. I can help you improve your skills and then send you back to the First Domain.”

The reason why Ye Qingtang chose this body for the Blood Moon Elder was mainly that the potential of this body was not bad and it was tainted with a lot of demon aura. The absorption speed of a body with an extremely strong demon aura would be many times faster than an ordinary person. Ye Qingtang could refine some elixirs that could increase his cultivation level rapidly. The Yongle Tribe General must have spent a long time with it, which was why this vessel was tainted with his demon aura.

This was one of the main reasons why Ye Qingtang chose this body for the Blood Moon Elder.

“Holy Lady… I’m not going back. I’ll follow you wherever you go. I’ll be worried about you all alone in the Second Domain. Although my skills may not be good, at least I can understand some of the situation in the Second Domain through my main body.” After a long while, the Blood Moon Elder looked at Ye Qingtang and finally made up his mind.

Just as Ye Qingtang said, he had been by Ye Qingtang’s side for a long time. If they separated this time and he returned to the First Domain, it would be meaningless even if he could call the wind and summon the rain.

He might as well follow the Holy Lady to the Second Domain. Although it was filled with unknown dangers, there were also unimaginable opportunities. Perhaps one day, he might be able to stand on equal footing with the main body, or even surpass it.

“Is this your decision?” Ye Qingtang looked at the Blood Moon Elder. “I don’t want to force you.”

“Holy Lady, this is my final decision. Actually, I am already sick of the First Domain.” The Blood Moon Elder smiled.

“Alright, prepare yourself then. We’ll leave at dawn,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Holy Lady… I don’t think I have anything to prepare.” The Blood Moon Elder looked around.

He had only been resurrected four hours ago, what could he prepare?

“Eh, what First Domain and Second Domain are you talking about? It’s so complicated, I don’t understand it at all.” The big yellow dog yawned.

Ye Qingtang looked at the big yellow dog meaningfully. It did not even know about the domains…Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com
