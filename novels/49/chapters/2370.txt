Chapter 2371: Let Me Play (1)

The other student paused before continuing. “This is called Spirit Jade. It is the license to enter the God Relic. The various academies compete in every Inter-Academy Competition just for the right to enter the God Relic. If I remember correctly, the Netherworld Academy only won one placement in the previous Inter-Academy Competition. What a pity that this placement is now in my hands.”

The opening of the God Relic was fixed at a certain time and only a predetermined number of people could enter. But a person could only remain inside the God Relic for one day before being required to leave. Meanwhile, the God Relic would remain open for several days. The more jade pendants they had, the more chances they would get to re-enter the God Relic and train.

Universe City’s Illusion Beast Chess was a betting arena for students who had the jade pendant. The stakes were the number of times one could enter the God Relic.

Lei Yan and the others were completely stunned. They knew this jade pendant was no ordinary item but didn’t expect it to be that precious.

They all turned to look at Ran Mo.

Ran Mo didn’t look defeated or distressed at all. His face was utterly calm.

“Let’s go.” Ran Mo suddenly smiled. The hearts of Lei Yan and the others twisted the moment they saw those little eye teeth of his.

“This… this is all my fault. Little Mo Mo, you…” Lei Yan just wanted to slap himself. If not for his curiosity, they wouldn’t have incurred so much trouble.

Ran Mo didn’t blame Lei Yan at all. The various academies all looked down on the Netherworld Academy. He had done what he did to protect the reputation of the Netherworld Academy.

While they may have fallen in the rankings, they must still uphold their dignity.

Ran Mo was prepared to leave. Lei Yan gritted his teeth and looked at the smug winner.

“Apart from the jade pendant, do you accept any other stakes? You can have anything you want, I will play against you!”

Ran Mo was taken aback.

Qin Feng and the others also spoke up.

“Elixirs, artifacts. Anything we have in our possession, you can ask for it.”

Amusement glinted in the eyes of the person as he observed the gang.

“No problem. I can give you guys a chance. As long as you can offer up enough items…”

…

It was already dark when Ye Qingtang and Wen Qi returned to the North Hall. Wen Qi and the others returned to their rooms while Ye Qingtang decided to check on her brats. Scanning the place, she could not see any one of them apart from Mu Ziying.

Ye Qingtang felt a slight headache coming along. She allowed them to go out and relax a bit. But weren’t t pushing it?

Exasperated, she went looking for Lei Yan and the others with Mu Ziying in tow.

“Hey, did you hear? Something exciting is going on in the back,” a teenager told his companion in an excited voice as he walked past Ye Qingtang.

“Are you talking about those fools from the Netherworld Academy? I saw it. Those fools have no idea what they are in for. To think that they even dare to play chess against Xing Rong… who doesn’t know that Xing Rong is renowned for his Illusion Beast Chess skills? He has never been defeated before. But they dared to challenge him…”

“What else can they do? They already lost their spirit jade. They are just trying to win back the Netherworld Academy’s only spirit jade. I think they must have already lost nearly every elixir and artifact on them…”

Ye Qingtang had not taken the teenagers’ words to heart at first, but she suddenly paused after hearing the words “Netherworld Academy” and “spirit jade”.
