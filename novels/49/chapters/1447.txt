Chapter 1448 Protecting One“s Child 2

“Suddenly attacked? Ah… Jiang Yiming, you’re so glib. You ordered men to capture my sworn brother and me, and when I argued with you, you decided to challenge me to a one-on-one fight. Why won’t you own up now?” asked Ye Qingtang.

“Who challenged you to a one-on-one fight?” Jiang Yiming flatly denied it. Anyway, besides the Beidou Demon Lord, everyone else present was on his side, and no one would bear witness on Ye Qingtang’s behalf.

“Do you have proof? Don’t talk nonsense.”

“That’s right, Brother Yiming never challenged you to a one-on-one fight. This is clearly just an excuse.” The youths seized upon this point and shouted vigorously.

“Who says I have no proof!” The Beidou Demon Lord, who had been silent all this while, suddenly spoke.

“You have proof? If you have proof, then show it to us!” Jiang Yiming said nonchalantly.

The Beidou Demon Lord was enraged by this group of people. He had watched them repeatedly bully Ye Qingtang, and his blood was boiling. He took a crystal-clear pearl from the thick fur growing on his chest.

Elder Meng and the others were taken aback when he took out this pearl.

“Memory Pearl?” Jiang Liu looked in astonishment at the pearl that the Beidou Demon Lord was holding. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The Memory Pearl could record recent events but only for a limited time. Also, if it was not activated, its records would be erased as time passed. Earlier scenes that had been recorded would be quickly replaced with new scenes.

But the Memory Pearl would be destroyed once it was activated.

The Memory Pearl could only be used once.

A trace of amusement flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes when she saw the Memory Pearl in the Beidou Demon Lord’s hand.

In her previous life, she had already learned that her sworn brother carried this Memory Pearl on his person. The Beidou Demon Lord had obtained this Memory Pearl by chance when he was young and always carried it with him. However, this object was not very useful, so the Beidou Demon Lord had not used it in his previous life.

Ye Qingtang had dared to oppose Jiang Yiming and the others because she knew that the Beidou Demon Lord had this treasure on his person.

“Memory Pearl? What’s that?” The Memory Pearl was rather useless, so it was natural that Jiang Yiming and the others had never seen it.

The Beidou Demon Lord laughed coldly and said, “Didn’t you want proof? Let me show you the proof!”

The moment he finished speaking, the Beidou Demon Lord abruptly crushed the Memory Pearl.

The moment the Memory Pearl was crushed, the scenes it had recorded immediately unfurled before their eyes.

The first scene was of the Beidou Demon Lord and Ye Qingtang, sitting on the ground and enjoying a good meal. But before long, Jiang Yiming and the others rushed over aggressively. The Memory Pearl not only recorded these scenes, but it even clearly recorded the voices.

Everyone present could now clearly hear the taunts and challenges issued by Jiang Yiming and the others.

Even the challenge he issued to Ye Qingtang for a one-on-one fight could be clearly heard.

Jiang Yiming’s face instantly turned pale.

He had not imagined that this lowly demon would possess such a strange Dharma treasure.

The true scenes and the clear voices tore Jiang Yiming’s lies apart.

“All of you can now see clearly that it was these people who bullied my younger sister. He is also the one who agreed to a one-on-one fight with my little sister. My little sister has not uttered a single lie.” The Beidou Demon Lord did not regret the loss of the Memory Pearl in the least. He was even willing to give up his life as long as he could prove Ye Qingtang’s innocence.
