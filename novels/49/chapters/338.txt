“My rules are simple: give me thirty percent of your Soul Condensation Pills every month. Then, I will look after you if you have any troubles.”

Song Junqiu just brought a group of people to show off; now, Feng Moli was even more extreme. He came to ask for a protection fee!

Song Junqiu, whose face was unpleasant, sneered as he heard Feng Moli’s words. His malicious sight landed on Ye Qingtang.

He forgot about that.

Feng Moli had a bad reputation in the inner sect. Asking for protection fee was a part of it. If new disciples dared to reject, Feng Moli would torture them to death.

Song Junqiu was waiting for the show to begin. He did not dare to do anything to Ye Qingtang in the sect, but Feng Moli… He had numerous ways to torture her.

Now, he just needed to sit at the side and watch the show.

Normal people could not even imagine the constant threat and extortion.

A faint smile appeared in Ye Qingtang’s eyes as she stared at the arrogant Feng Moli.

Ye Qingtang spoke when Song Junqiu was still waiting for her reaction.

“But… my Soul Condensation Pills were all given to Senior Brother Song.”

Song Junqiu, who was waiting for the show, was shocked upon hearing her words.

What did she just say?!

Feng Moli frowned instantly.

Ye Qingtang continued worriedly. “I have heard of such inner sect rules. I gave all my Soul Condensation Pills when Senior Brother Song asked for it just now. He said he would look after me as well.”

“…” Song Junqiu opened his eyes wide.

“What nonsense are you talking about!”

Ye Qingtang gave a perfectly guileless look to Song Junqiu. “Senior Brother Song, I’m telling the truth. Did you not take all the Soul Condensation Pills?”

“Senior Brother Feng, if you do not believe me, you can search my room. I promise there is no single bottle of the Soul Condensation Pills in the room. I have given them all to Senior Brother Song.” Ye Qingtang even opened her space ring in front of everyone to show that there were no Soul Condensation Pills inside.

Song Junqiu felt as if his brain had exploded.

The ten bottles of Soul Condensation Pills were smashed by him just now. Even the residues were cleaned by the sword boy.

Feng Moli scanned through Ye Qingtang’s room. He saw that the box that was supposed to contain the Soul Condensation Pills was now empty. His face darkened, and he gazed at Song Junqiu instantly.

“Song Junqiu, what do you want?”

Every disciple knew that Feng Moli asked for a protection fee in the inner sect.

Yet, Song Junqiu dared to take over his business?!

“Junior Brother Feng. This is a mistake. I have never taken Ye Qingtang’s Soul Condensation Pills!” Song Junqiu’s whole body froze as he was stared at by Feng Moli. He was very clear how horrifying the tyrant in front of him was. He would never dare to take over his business!

Song Junqiu wanted to beat Ye Qingtang to death now. It was obvious that she was finding trouble for him.
