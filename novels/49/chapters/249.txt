After settling down the silver wolf, Ye Qingtang went to submit her mission.

At this time, most of the disciples in the same batch as Ye Qingtang had not returned. When the warden saw Ye Qingtang, he could not help but find it a little strange.

“Warden, I’m here to submit the mission,” Ye Qingtang said to the Warden.

The Warden swept a look across Ye Qingtang with a hint of confusion in his eyes.

“Why are you the one submitting the mission? Where’s Zhou Xuan?” The warden said impatiently.

Ye Qingtang looked at the annoyed face of the Warden and lowered her eyes. “Senior Brother Zhou is already dead.”

“What?!” The warden’s expression changed.

Ye Qingtang saw the drastic change in the warden’s expression and laughed internally.

When she left Spirit Condensation Mountain Village, Zhou Xuan was indeed still alive, but now… he would probably be dead already.

“What exactly happened!” The warden had an ugly expression on his face. If there were no accidents in sect missions, disciples only needed to submit their mission to the warden, but if there were casualties, the warden had to report it to the outer sect elders.

At that very instant, the warden’s mood was terrible.

It should be known that he transferred Ye Qingtang, a new disciple, into Zhou Xuan’s team as an exception after accepting many benefits from Zhou Xuan the other time.

However… reassigning sect missions in secret was not allowed in the sect. New disciples like Ye Qingtang, especially, would definitely not be appointed to take on overly dangerous missions for old disciples.

Previously, the warden was aware that Zhou Xuan intended to use this chance to teach Ye Qingtang a lesson and thus did not think too much about it, though everything would be different once the outer sect elders hear of this.

Looking at the warden’s slightly pale face, Ye Qingtang obviously knew what he was worried about, but she did not show it and only told him everything that happened in Spirit Condensation Mountain Village in full detail, while excluding Han Cangming’s appearance and the fact that Zhou Xuan was not yet dead at that time on purpose.

The more the warden listened, the more shocked he was. Things were utterly beyond his expectation.

He originally thought that nothing would happen in an investigation in Spirit Condensation Mountain Village. Hence, he dared to abuse his power and make an exception for Zhou Xuan. Yet unexpectedly…

“Noted. I will inform the outer sect elders about this.” The warden was extremely frustrated as the matter concerned the deaths of three disciples and was related to the resurrection of the Blood Moon Sect. There was no way he could hide this even if he wanted to.

Ye Qingtang nodded obediently and took her leave.

While the warden could only muster his courage and inform the elder of the outer sect Sword Faction.

Before Ye Qingtang could even enter her room, a senior brother summoned for her and said that the outer sect elder asked for her to head over.

Ye Qingtang immediately went with that senior brother.

In just a while, Ye Qingtang was brought to all elders of the outer sect. In the hall were the four elders from the outer sect’s Sword Faction, Fist Faction, Array Faction, and Herbal Faction had arrived, while the warden who relayed the message was present as well. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Along with Ye Qingtang’s appearance, the four outer sect elder’s eyes were immediately gathered on that tiny figure.

Elder Huang from the outer sect’s Sword Faction looked up at Ye Qingtang, who entered the hall. A tight frown was seen on his face as he cast a sharp look at Ye Qingtang. He had seen Ye Qingtang when he was leading the new disciples into the sect previously, but… he did not pay much attention to her because her spirit root was too inferior…
