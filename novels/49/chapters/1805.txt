Ye Qingtang shook her head as she heard the melody. It made her lower her guard so she was unable to feel wary towards the mystic realm’s dangers.

But this false sense of calm would be deadly in this place.

Biting her tongue, Ye Qingtang used the pain to dissipate the strange feelings that were pervading her mind. She had thought that the lady’s voice was enchanting but now her heart filled with panic as she realized how bewitching it was.

“Let’s go.” Without wasting another second, Ye Qingtang decided to circle around the woman and get through the Scorched Hot Lands another way.

But before she had taken too many steps, the lady’s warm, beautiful voice suddenly changed into one that was cold and filled with sorrow.

This sudden change made Ye Qingtang’s heart leap to her mouth.

She hadn’t forgotten the freezing wind that the change in melody had brought last time.

“I have a bad feeling about this.” Ye Qingtang frowned and looked towards the sky. The scorching sky was gradually being covered in dark red clouds.

Almost instinctively, Ye Qingtang grabbed Little Heavenly Demon and Little White Tiger and flew forwards quickly. She had a feeling that the woman’s voice would just become even more insane... and dangerous.

As Ye Qingtang flew as fast as she could, the lady’s voice turned resentful and sinister.

By now, the dark red clouds had already gradually covered the sky. Rays of red light shone through the clouds. In the next second, thunder boomed through the land and red flames started falling through the clouds!

“It’s raining fire!” Ye Qingtang looked at the flames falling ceaselessly from the sky in shock as she quickly adjusted the energy around her to protect herself.

As the flames rained down on them, Ye Qingtang suddenly realized that they were drops of lava!

Even though she was protecting herself, she could still feel burning pain as the lava fell on her.

“We can’t keep running. We have to find a place to hide from the flames or we’re going to be burned to death!” Little White Tiger was in a panic. It grew bigger, grabbed Ye Qingtang and Little Heavenly Demon in his mouth and ran forwards as quickly as he could.

As the molten magma fell to the ground like rain, it created dents in the ground and spread out, covering the earth with flames. In the blink of an eye, the entire ground was covered in a sea of flames, the bodies of the True Gods burning ferociously.

Little White Tiger cursed in his heart as the lava burned painfully. It was lucky that it had a thick hide and strong flesh or it would’ve been burned to a skeleton in an instant!

Ye Qingtang was terrified as well and she quickly looked for a cave they could hide in temporarily. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

There!

As her eyes scanned the surroundings, Ye Qingtang suddenly spotted a dilapidated building nearby and asked Little White Tiger to fly towards it.

Under the raining flames, the woman’s voice had become twisted and fierce as the flames became thick and dense. The entire earth had been transformed into a sea of fire and it felt as though they were in an oven. The temperature alone was enough to cook a human in its rabid s.
