Chapter 628: Evil Spirits Realm

“An even better land of inheritance…” Ye Qingtang was in thought as she looked at the little white tiger.

The little white tiger had lived in the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm for very long and should be familiar with this place. Thus, knowing an even better land of inheritance was reasonable.

At that instant, the little white tiger locked its eyes on the palace in the air and said, “Inside that palace is a blessed land of inheritance. Although it’s considered pretty good, I know an even better land of inheritance. I can bring you there.”

“What inheritance is it?” Ye Qingtang questioned.

“I’m not sure about that yet.” The little white tiger shook his head. “I can smell which land of inheritance is better with my nose, but I have never entered any before.”

Seeing that Ye Qingtang was silent, the little white tiger said impatiently, “Do you want to go or not?”

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang eventually nodded and agreed.

Although the Hell of Avicinaraka was extremely dangerous, the inheritances and destinies here were very large as well. With such a chance, how would she give up easily?

“How long have you been in the Hell of Avicinaraka?” Ye Qingtang looked at the little white tiger in curiosity.

“How long?” The little white tiger pondered for a moment, seeming to be thinking about it seriously, but ultimately shook his head. “I don’t remember clearly already… It has been too long, and exactly because of that, I’m very clear of everything in the Hell of Avicinaraka.”

“Oh… So how dangerous is the land of inheritance that you mentioned just now?” Ye Qingtang asked again.

The little white tiger shot a look at Ye Qingtang. “Woman, since it’s a land of inheritance, danger naturally exists. As for how dangerous it is, how would I know? I’ve never been in it before.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“You… know that I’m a female?” Ye Qingtang was stunned

“F*ck you.” The little white tiger felt that it was humiliated. “That lady kept calling you Holy Lady just now. If you aren’t disguised, then what could it be? Do you really think that I’m stupid?”

The lady that the little white tiger talked about naturally referred to the Blood Moon Elder.

Ye Qingtang was actually speechless after hearing that.

“Oh right, I see that there is a trace of demonic aura on you all. You all can’t be related to that Blood Moon Sect, can you…” The little white tiger said meaningfully.

“How do you know about the Blood Moon Sect…” Ye Qingtang was stunned. In the little white tiger’s mouth, the Blood Moon Aura on their bodies seemed to have become demonic aura…

“Hmph… I am a Fiendcelestial Beast. I know everything in the heavens above and the earth underneath. I also know everything from five thousand years ago and the happenings from now on. Is there anything else I don’t know?” The little white tiger had a proud expression.

“So do you know that you will be injured in the future by talking like this?” Ye Qingtang smiled faintly.

“…”

“Hmph. Let’s not talk about that… It seems that you’re really the Holy Lady of that Blood Moon Holy Lord… But I’ll advise you to stay away from the Blood Moon Sect, especially that Blood Moon Holy Lord. You better stay away from him as far as possible.” The little white tiger pursed its lips.

“Blood Moon Holy Lord?” Ye Qingtang looked at the little white tiger. “What is the reason for that?”

The Blood Moon Holy Lord was her sworn younger brother. Why could she not be close to him?

“Forget it if you don’t listen.” The little white tiger seemed to be unwilling to be entangled on this topic and said, “Right ahead is the Evil Spirits Realm. After passing through, you can reach the land of inheritance that I said. Hurry on.”

Ye Qingtang carried the little white tiger in her arms and called for the Blood Moon Elder before heading towards the Evil Spirits Realm which the little white tiger spoke of.
