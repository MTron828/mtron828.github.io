Chapter 1845: Cross-Dresser (3)

Jiang Shaobai’s gender wasn’t a secret within the ancient clans at all. Everyone knew that he was a male, but he had a unique personality and liked dressing as a female so no one bothered about him.

As for Mu Feiruo...

He grew up with a female identity in the Mu family and everyone else saw him as a female. Moreover, he was first place in the previous beauty rankings.

He was a goddess who could only be appreciated from far away in Jiang Yisheng’s eyes.

“Stop talking nonsense. Mi–Young Master Mu is low-key.” Ye Qingtang tried her best to cover for Mu Feiruo.

Mu Feiruo, “...”

He didn’t want to say anything else.

Please just let him fall unconscious and die.

The biggest tragedy in life was suffering such a huge blow after coming back from the dead.

He wasn’t prepared for it at all, why did he have to experience such brutality? Even if he wasn’t a tender flower... they should give him basic respect at least...

“Whatever Sister Qing says.” Jiang Shaobai was extremely pleased that Ye Qingtang was distracted. With his eyes crinkling into a smile, he put on a coat and appeared beside Ye Qingtang. He stretched his hand out, wanting to cling onto Ye Qingtang’s arm as he always used to. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

However, this time, Ye Qingtang slapped his hand away.

“Sister Qing, you’ve changed. You no longer love me...” Jiang Shaobai covered his face with his hands, almost tearing as he looked at Ye Qingtang aggrievedly.

“How can you be sexist!”

“Apologies, I favor girls over boys,” Ye Qingtang replied honestly.

Jiang Shaobai was furious.

Without an avenue to vent his frustrations, Jiang Shaobai’s eyes landed on Mu Feiruo, who was trying his best to cover his body up. His eyes then riveted on Baili Xi, who lay on the ground without moving at all. He then kicked Baili Xi’s leg.

“Stop pretending. You woke up long ago, why are you still lying there.”

Having been kicked a few times, Baili Xi was forced to sit up. With a stiff expression on his usually cold face, he was at a loss. He hadn’t expected himself to hear such exciting news right when he woke up.

Baili Xi wasn’t interested in the affairs of others, so he didn’t know Jiang Shaobai’s gender and only saw him as a young, capable lady from the Jiang family. But as for Mu Feiruo....

Looking at his past competitor, Baili Xi felt really... complicated inside.

Mu Feiruo felt even more complicated inside.

“Coughs. Where are we now?” Baili Xi pretended that nothing had just happened. He only remembered himself dropping into a huge hole and nothing else after that.

Everyone present had powers and they could feel that the surroundings and aura now was completely different from that of the mystic realm previously.

Ye Qingtang didn’t intend to hide anything. She told them about her meeting them, destroying the remains of the Cursed True God, as well as traveling through time.

But she hid the purpose of the Deity Ocean from them, only explaining that because the Cursed True God’s remains had been destroyed, they ended up in this safe place.

After Jiang Shaobai and the others heard Ye Qingtang’s words, they couldn’t help but feel scared inside.

They hadn’t expected themselves to be consumed by the forces of the mystic realm and become mutant Fire Demons. Though Ye Qingtang hadn’t gone into the nitty-gritty details, they could already tell that it was extremely dangerous from her description.

Ten of them stepped into the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm together and yet only the four of them came out alive.

The arrogant Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo knew that if not for Ye Qingtang, they probably would have died in the mystic realm.
