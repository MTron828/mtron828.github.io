Chapter 2656 I’m Here To Kill You (1)

Ye Qingtang looked at the calm and collected Temple of Paragon’s Paragon standing beside her. Several men from the Heavenly Demon Tribe Branch had just died miserably at her hands.

Indeed, as an Immortal Emperor, how could she be gentle?

“Sister Ye Yue, I have an idea,” the Paragon said to Ye Qingtang after killing the black-robed men.

Ye Qingtang was stunned by the Paragon’s words. She did not understand what she meant.

“Sister Ah Yao, what is it?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“It’s about the black tower.” The Paragon ignored the last black-robed man in the sky. Instead, she turned toward the black tower.

“When the two of us get close to the tower, our mental states will be disturbed. I want to know if the black tower is only targeting you and me.” The Paragon explained to Ye Qingtang.

A glint flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes. The Paragon’s idea was not bad.

If the black tower was only targeting her and the Paragon, then it should not be difficult for others to get close or even enter the building. However, if others were also affected by the tower in the same way as the two of them, then it proved that the black tower was not specifically targeting the two of them.

“So Sister Ah Yao means to use him to test the black tower?” Ye Qingtang pointed at the black-robed man in the sky.

“Yes, Sister Ye Yue understands me the best.” The Paragon nodded.

The remaining black-robed man’s expression changed when he overheard Ye Qingtang’s conversation with the Paragon. He immediately turned around and fled into the distance.

In the blink of an eye, the black-robed man had already fled and disappeared without a

trace. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Sister Ah Yao, he ran away,” Ye Qingtang said.

The Paragon smiled. In the next second, the black-robed man, who had already disappeared without a trace, was swept up by a violent wind and brought back to this place without any ability to resist. “Crash!”

The black-robed man fell heavily to the ground.

“You… you two!”

The black-robed man was sweating profusely as he stared at Ye Qingtang and the Paragon. His body trembled slightly.

“If you kill me… the Heavenly Demon Tribe will definitely not let you off. Are you going to become enemies with the entire Heavenly Demon Tribe?!” The man’s voice trembled slightly.

He never expected to see two Ye Yue here, and that the other Ye Yue’s cultivation level was so unfathomable.

“I don’t think the Heavenly Demon Tribe will go after an Immortal Emperor because of a mere branch member,” Ye Qingtang said calmly as she stared at the black-robed man.

The black-robed man felt like his last hope had been snatched away by Ye Qingtang’s words.

Indeed, as one of the supreme powers in the Divine Venerate Domain, the Heavenly Demon Tribe had countless branches. It was not likely for them to chase after an Immortal Emperor just because of a mere branch member.

“Furthermore, we just want you to help us with something. If you listen to us obediently, your life will be spared.” Ye Qingtang smiled at the black-robed man.

The black-robed man’s eyes flickered. They just wanted his help? They wouldn’t kill him?

“Well… what do you need my help with?” The black-robed man asked carefully.

“You just have to do as we say. Don’t ask so many questions, ” said Ye Qingtang.
