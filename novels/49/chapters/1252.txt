Chapter 1253: Misspoken Words (3)

“Brother Luo, today is your birthday. There’s no need to fuss over small matters with these people and spoil your mood.” Hong Zhong did not expect Luo Qufeng to strike suddenly as it was very unlike his usual behavior.

Nonetheless, Luo Qufeng merely lifted his chin up and looked at Dong Yue Manor Chief, who fell to the ground.

“My… my powers…” Dong Yue Manor Chief was scarily pale as though he was picked up from underwater. He suddenly looked up at Luo Qufeng with hatred.

“Luo Qufeng, you old jerk! You absorbed all of my powers!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

At that moment, Dong Yue Manor Chief felt that his energy had been completely sucked away. All his martial realm that he cultivated for thousands of years was actually absorbed away by Luo Qufeng in that one moment!

Dong Yue Manor Chief’s words stunned everyone.

Luo Qufeng absorbed all of his powers?

What did that mean?

Other people from Dong Yue Manor hurried forward and held their Manor Chief up nervously.

They, as well, did not think that Luo Qufeng would attack suddenly.

Everything happened too abruptly.

As Luo Qufeng looked at the pale Dong Yue Manor Chief, the wide smile on his face was laced with menace.

“Dong Yue Manor Chief, I tolerated you for too long. It’s you, yourself, who didn’t know what’s good for you. However… you should thank me instead. From now on, your powers will be mine to use, and this will be an honor for you.”

Everyone was dumbfounded by Luo Qufeng’s words.

Luo Qufeng really absorbed all of Dong Yue Manor Chief’s powers away?

“Senior Luo, Dong Yue Manor Chief was indeed wrong, but there should be a line to everything. Isn’t what you did too overboard?”

“Right. If Dong Yue Manor Chief was disrespectful, the Luo Family can simply chase them out. Why must you do this?”

Many of the guests had some ties with the Luo Family and Dong Yue Manor, and the sudden incident truly caught them off guard.

They just felt that Luo Qufeng’s attack out of anger was too out of place

However, Luo Qufeng did not have any intention to stop as he looked across everyone with a smile.

“I’m afraid you are all mistaken.”

Luo Qufeng explained. “I am very thankful that you all can come today, but from today on, all of you will become a part of me. Your powers will also soon be for me to use, and you all will accompany me to ascend to the peak of this world through another form,” Luo Qufeng said smilingly as insanity filled his eyes.

“Luo Qufeng, what do you mean by that?” Everyone was alarmed when they heard something off in Luo Qufeng’s tone.

Luo Qufeng chuckled. In the next second, a gleam enshrouded over the Luo Residence, and all the exits were sealed by spells.

Everyone’s expression changed.

“Today is the most important day of your lives. Offering your powers to me will be your honor.” Luo Qufeng looked up slightly as his eyes passed through everyone at the scene.

It was only at this instant that the guests realized that the birthday banquet today was simply a trap by the Luo Family.

Luo Qufeng was actually so berserk to this state: he used the pretense of his birthday banquet to deceive countless powerful figures into coming only to absorb everyone’s powers for his own use on this night!

“Luo Qufeng, you are a shameless, old bastard. Why did I not see through your sinister plans earlier!”
