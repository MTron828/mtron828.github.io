The Blood Moon Elder and Ye Qingtang exchanged glances, and the Blood Moon Elder stared at the big yellow dog. “Brother Canine… in my heart, you were never just a dog. You are a powerful practitioner. It is most suitable for you to step up.”

“Get lost.” The yellow dog wagged its tail and glared at Blood Moon Elder.

Although its skin was thick and it could not be beaten to death, it would still feel pain. Who or what in the world would seek out pain for no reason? The big yellow dog was no exception.

Before the Blood Moon Elder could say anything, the figure in the distance turned into a ray of light. An all-encompassing aura surrounded him and he appeared beside Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder.

Ye Qingtang’s heart leaped up into her throat. The man had discovered their presence and knew their precise position.

It was also at this moment that Ye Qingtang finally saw the man’s face clearly.

Long, jet-black hair flowed loosely behind his back. His face was so handsome that it seemed like it did not belong to the mortal world. His eyes did not bear any human emotions, and a single glance was enough to make one feel like you were falling into an ice cave.

It had to be said that this man’s looks and figure were truly impeccable.

At this moment, the man looked around and remained rooted to the ground.

Cold sweat seeped out of the Blood Moon Elder’s forehead and he held his breath, not daring to breathe.

Ye Qingtang was deep in thought. It seemed that her previous guess was correct. Although this man could roughly grasp their location, he could not capture them. As long as the Divine Concealment Spell remained, the man could not do anything to them.

Unless he could kill them through space.

Seeing that the man did not move at all for a long time, the Blood Moon Elder finally felt relieved. “Holy Lady, this guy can’t see us. Haha, there’s nothing to be afraid of!” The Blood Moon Elder looked at Ye Qingtang and smiled.

However, just as the Blood Moon Elder finished his sentence, a frighteningly cold glint flashed across the man’s eyes. Subsequently, a fist shrouded in a black sheen shot towards Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder.

Just the draft from that punch was enough to suffocate Ye Qingtang and Blood Moon Elder. Their skin felt as though they had been struck by lightning.

Almost instinctively, Ye Qingtang grabbed the Blood Moon Elder and rolled on the ground.

A loud “boom” resounded throughout the entire venue. Following that, the sound of glass shattering could be heard.

Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder saw that the space where they were previously standing was shattered like a mirror by the man’s punch, forming a fist-sized black hole.

“I…”

Ye Qingtang’s forehead was dripping with sweat. This monster… could really kill them through space!

Ye Qingtang glared at the Blood Moon Elder.

Was this guy an idiot?

Although they had the Divine Concealment Spell and others could not see them with their naked eyes, it did not mean that the spell could block their voices.

The man was only a few meters away from them just now and the Blood Moon Elder was just chattering away. Was he trying to let the man know their exact location?!

When the Blood Moon Elder was in the First Domain back then, he was a terrifying existence. Although he was not that intelligent, he was still considered quite shrewd.

What was going on with him now? Why was he starting to reveal his stupidity at such a critical moment?
