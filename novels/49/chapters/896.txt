Chapter 897 Take Advantage of Others (3)

Feng Wuya pulled out a dagger by his waist. He grabbed Feng Wudang’s hair and swung his dagger beside Feng Wudang’s ear.

“Should I cut off your left ear or right ear?” Feng Wuya laughed. He did not even bother with the disciples of the Supreme Academy at the side. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Fine, I will chop off both of your ears as a lesson to learn for you. You should be thankful that I’m only going to cut your ears and not take your life.” Feng Wuya sneered and said.

Feng Wudang narrowed his eyes and clenched his fists that were by his body.

A disciple of the Divine Virtual Academy laughed and said, “Senior Brother Feng, you are still so kind. People like him should be killed without mercy. He should bow and thank you for your mercy to spare his life today.”

“You’re taking advantage of our tolerance!” One of the Supreme Academy disciples could not tolerate it anymore. He pulled out his sword and pointed at Feng Wuya.

“Feng Wuya! Let go of Senior Brother Feng!”

Feng Wuya raised his brows slightly. His eyes were full of sarcasm as he saw the Supreme Academy disciple pulling his sword out.

Li Xiu and the rest were shocked when they saw the situation.

“Junior Brother Luo, don’t be impulsive!”

Feng Wuya sneered. “It seems like the disciples of the Supreme Academy do not understand the rules. How dare you point a sword at me!”

He then scoffed and commanded. “Get that bastard over here now.”

The Divine Virtual Academy disciples immediately rushed forward and surrounded Junior Brother Luo.

Gu Tianhe and the rest panicked and wanted to stop them.

However…

“What? It seems like even the ancient Feng Clan are not seen as anything in the eyes of the Supreme Academy people now?” Feng Wuya scoffed.

“Don’t!” Li Xiu immediately blocked Gu Tianhe and the rest.

They could not offend Feng Wuya based on his identity.

Normal disciples like them could not afford to provoke the ancient Feng clan.

If they displeased Feng Wuya, the entire Supreme Academy would have to suffer the consequence with them.

Feng Wuya sneered and looked at everything happening in front of him. He then raised his leg and kicked Feng Wudang. He walked towards Junior Brother Luo, who was surrounded by people of the Divine Virtual Academy, and left Feng Wudang alone.

“How dare you point a sword at me?” Feng Wuya raised his chin arrogantly as he stared at Junior Brother Luo, whose face was pale.

Junior Brother Luo’s expression froze.

“Feng Wuya, you should not be so reckless even if you are from the ancient Feng clan!”

“Oh?” Feng Wuya lifted his brows slightly and scoffed. Suddenly, he kicked Junior Brother Luo’s stomach in the next instant.

Junior Brother Luo took a few steps back as a result of the kick. He was about to raise his sword and kill the bastard instinctively.

However, before he could get close, the other disciples of the Divine Virtual Academy dashed towards him and snatched his sword away. He was then pressed onto the ground!

“Reckless? Yes, I’m reckless. But what can you do to me?” A trace of malice appeared in Feng Wuya’s eyes as Junior Brother Luo was restrained on the ground. He took a step forward slowly and stepped on Junior Brother Luo’s fingers with one leg.
