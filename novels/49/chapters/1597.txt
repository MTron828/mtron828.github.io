Chapter 1598 Kingdom Fortress

No one expected the allied forces to retreat. However, within a short time, the allied forces had retreated by several meters and even sped up. Shortly thereafter, the large troop swiftly vanished from the sight of Ye Qingtang and the others.“...” Ye Qingtang was speechless.

The large group of guardsmen who had charged forward could not help but cheer when they saw the allied forces retreat.

General Mark heaved a huge sigh of relief. He swung himself off the horse and hurriedly walked towards Ye Qingtang.

“Tang, you were too impulsive just now!” Although he spoke sternly, his tone was filled with concern and anxiety. General Mark took a deep breath, and his expression grew warmer.

“Tang, you are really the bravest girl I have ever met.”

General Mark had taken in the guardsmen’s reaction to the situation at a glance. The enemy’s strength had frightened them into retreating. Otherwise, General Mark would not have charged into the battlefield by himself.

But General Mark had not expected that Ye Qingtang, the petite young girl who had just joined them, would also dare to face the enemy head-on.

If Ye Qingtang had not joined the battle, the guardsmen would have huddled up and refused to advance.

At that thought, General Mark looked at Ye Qingtang’s glittering eyes. He took a deep breath and seemed to come to some sort of decision. “Tang, your skills and courage are commendable. I do not know why the allied forces suddenly retreated. I am unable to leave this place, but I will ask someone to bring my letter of recommendation with you to Kingdom Fortress. I will recommend you to His Majesty, the King!”

Ye Qingtang was startled. She did not expect General Mark to recommend her to the Supreme League Kingdom’s King straight away. However, this would allow her to complete her mission more quickly anyway.

At that thought, Ye Qingtang said, “Thank you, General Mark.”

“Haha, no need to thank me. You are an outstanding young lady. Right now, the kingdom needs people like you, ” General Mark said with a loud laugh. He rallied his troops and sent someone to keep a close eye on the allied troop’s movements. Then, he arranged for a vice-general to accompany Ye Qingtang to Kingdom Fortress while carrying the letter that he had personally written.

Ye Qingtang had intended to have a word with the Bishop of York; after all, the Bishop of York also seemed to want to recommend her. However, she learned from the other believers that the Bishop of York had gone to another city and would not be back for a few days.

Ye Qingtang left a message with the believers and headed for the Kingdom Fortress with General Mark’s vice-general.

A few days later, Bishop of York, who was happily prepared to hitch himself to Ye Qingtang’s rising star, returned only to discover that she had left...

Ye Qingtang and the vice-general hurried on their horses towards Kingdom Fortress. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

After the Supreme League Kingdom declared war, Kingdom Fortress became the biggest fortress at the front line. It was personally defended by the Supreme League Kingdom’s current king and contained the best troops in the kingdom.

This was the safest but most dangerous place.

When the vice-general arrived at Kingdom Fortress, he immediately hurried Ye Qingtang to the palace to meet His Majesty, the King.

Ye Qingtang’s black hair and dark eyes attracted a lot of attention along the way. However, their reaction was not as exaggerated as that of people in the first city. This was so especially in Kingdom Fortress, where the soldiers merely took a look at Ye Qingtang before going about their own preparations.
