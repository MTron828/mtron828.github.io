1429 Sisterhood 1

“Alright. This child suffered quite a shock today. Arrange a place for her to stay first. We will inform the Domain Monarch about this once he is out of seclusion,” Elder Xu said considerately.

Jiang Liu nodded and immediately ordered people to arrange rooms for Ye Qingtang and Beidou Demon Lord.

The other members of the Jiang Family were shocked by the abrupt surprise, but they naturally welcomed her since she carried the Jiang Family bloodline.

Only Ye You and Ye Xun had extremely dark expressions.

They would have not thought that Ye Qingtang was a member of the Jiang Family.

“Sister You, why did Ye Qingtang become part of the Jiang Family? Is there anything odd in this? Perhaps she is an impostor?” Ye Xun had a struggling expression as her abhorrence for Ye Qingtang was deep in the bones.

Ever since she followed Ye You to the Jiang Family, Ye Xun had gained benefits, and her identity was different from others.

All the more did she have no respect for Ye Qingtang.

However…

This sudden change affected Ye Xun greatly.

Ye You inhaled deeply and tried to maintain her facial expression so as to not let anyone notice her oddity.

“How can one easily impose as a member of the Jiang Family? Do you think that the Domain Monarch’s Jiang clan is so easy to deceive?” Ye You said with a hushed voice.

The Jiang Family’s unique Heavenly Demon Bloodline was not replicable. Otherwise, many others would use the opportunity to cling onto the powerful force of the Jiang Family.

Some people once used all sorts of methods to replicate the Heavenly Demon Bloodline. However, the resonance between the bloodlines could not be imitated, and those impostors were caught by the sharp eyes of the Jiang Family. None of those exposed impostors survived.

Now that even Jiang Liu was certain that Ye Qingtang was a member of the Jiang Family, that Heavenly Demon Bloodline must be real.

“But how can I bear to see Ye Qingtang crawling into the Jiang Family just like this?” Ye Xun complained while repressing her emotions Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Do you think I like it too?” Ye You glared at Ye Xun coldly.

She would never understand why Ye Qingtang had such good luck.

Ye Xun opened her mouth but did not dare to anger the current Ye You.

At that instant, Jiang Liu and Elder Xu brought Ye Qingtang to Ye You and Ye Xun.

Ye Xun immediately lowered her head. In front of others, she was someone related to the Jiang Family, but in front of the Jiang Family, she was merely an outsider…

She had already incurred the dissatisfaction of Elder Xu after insulting Ye Qingtang earlier on.

“You, there may have been some misunderstandings between you and Tang Tang. However, both of you are part of the Jiang Family now. It is quite a coincidence. I heard that both of you were sisters in the same family clan in the First Mainland, is that right?” Jiang Liu asked with a smile.

As Ye You looked at Ye Qingtang, who was behind Jiang Liu, she clenched her fists that were hidden in her sleeves but put on a flawless act of obedience.

“Yes. Tang Tang and I were indeed from the same family clan. I did not think that we would be so fated either. We did have some misunderstandings before, but since we are sisters of the same clan, of course I am delighted,” Ye You said with a smile as she clenched her fists to restrain herself from ripping Ye Qingtang apart.

Ye Qingtang laughed scornfully on the inside at the sight of Ye You’s feigned gentleness.

Delighted?

Ye You’s acting skills improved.

She probably would have wanted to lunge at her and rip me apart, wouldn’t she?
