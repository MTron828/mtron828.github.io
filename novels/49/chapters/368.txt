Chapter 369: Mighty Senior Sister (4)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

There was a smile in Ye Qingtang’s eyes as she looked at the group of disciples.

Temporarily leaving aside the fact that the disciples competed amongst each other within the sect, all of them were shouldering the same sect glory once they were out of the sect.

“We are from the same sect. There’s no need to thank me,” Ye Qingtang said with a smile. Afterward, she handed the Wind Sword Sect disciples’ “compensation” of over thirty Elegant Moon Pills to the leading disciple.

“These are Wind Sword Sect’s compensation to you all. Divide it amongst yourselves.”

The disciples shook their heads in a fluster.

“No no no… We cannot accept these, Senior Sister Ye. If not for you, we would have either died or been heavily insulted and injured. We cannot accept these items.”

Ye Qingtang looked at them funnily.

“Why can’t you accept it? They compensated you all, not me. Furthermore, I only said a few sentences. You are all injured and are delayed by a few days. If not compensated well, you all would fall behind others.”

The disciples were at a loss of whether to laugh or cry.

Senior sister, those few sentences that you said then were the key!

Calculating the price of these Elegant Moon Pills and then the number of sentences that Ye Qingtang said, a single word from her was really almost worth a thousand teals of gold!

The group could not win over Ye Qingtang and could only accept it reluctantly, though their hearts were deeply filled with gratitude.

Lu Xiuwen and Su Wan had been lingering outside and did not near Ye Qingtang. It was as though the two of them were isolated by the group.

Ye Qingtang naturally did not pay them any attention and took a leave first after leaving some instructions for the group.

The mission this time was rather simple and unrelated to the Blood Moon Sect. Everything was smooth.

Ye Qingtang had just left, but the disciples had still not returned to their senses from Ye Qingtang’s valiant and heroic bearing.

As outer sect disciples, they rarely had chances to interact with inner sect disciples. To them, the words ‘inner sect’ was unreachable and extremely mysterious.

“Senior Sister Ye is such a nice person.” Qiao Mo scratched his head, and his eyes were filled with gratitude.

“Did you all see clearly just now? That one move from Senior Sister Ye was so domineering!” A disciple was still absorbed in that one move that Ye Qingtang unleashed previously. Just looking at the many trees that were chopped, one could tell how frightening that sword aura was.

“Did Senior Sister Ye use the sword aura just now? Weren’t only Martial Qi Level Ones able to use it? Why do I remember that… Senior Sister Ye had only entered the inner sect for one month…” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The famous story of Ye Qingtang’s entrance into the inner sect had long circulated in the outer sect, and the few of them were not unfamiliar with it. However, after seeing her in person today, they realized…

Senior Sister Ye was way more domineering than the rumors had told her to be.

“Senior Sister Ye was able to advance from Connate Level Nine to Martial Qi Level One in a month’s time. She is indeed powerful and truly the disciple who entered the inner sect in the shortest time. If I have just ten percent of her skills, I would be content already.”

Everyone was full of exclamation over Ye Qingtang’s skills and did not notice that Lu Xiuwen’s face was extremely somber.

He had felt that he improved greatly in this one month, yet unexpectedly…

Ye Qingtang’s skills improved at a tremendous pace.

With just that little improvement of his, it was an utter joke in comparison to Ye Qingtang.

Su Wan looked at Lu Xiuwen’s somber side profile and did not dare to say anything further.

However, from the incident today, Su Wan realized…

Ye Qingtang had long been at another level.
