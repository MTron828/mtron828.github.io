Chapter 2374: Toying With Someone (1)

Ye Qingtang felt her head ache a little as she looked at her foolish brats. She shifted her gaze and looked at Xing Rong.

“And what are you offering?”

Xing Rong snapped out of his trance and put on a calm act. “Your students played five rounds with me, and these are all the items they have lost to me. I will bet with the items they lost to me during the last round.”

Ye Qingtang nodded.

“Can we start now?”

Xing Rong nodded. He was very eager to win the Nine Melody Spirit Elixir.

Without further ado, the game of chess started. The teenagers from the various academies had heard about the Nine Melody Spirit Elixir and the surrounding crowd of spectators grew.

Everyone was waiting eagerly for a good show.

Xing Rong wanted that Nine Melody Spirit Elixir but he was in no hurry to immediately defeat Ye Qingtang. This teacher was able to offer a precious item like the Nine Melody Spirit Elixir. He might have other valuable treasures.

Xing Rong purposely slowed down the intensity of his attacks, trying to pretend that his skills were nearly on par with him, before delivering the final fatal blow. This was to make him believe that he had lost by just one move and instigate him to play again.

Everything was going according to Xing Rong’s plan. He predicted Ye Qing’s every move and gave the impression of just managing to avoid being defeated while secretly controlling the entire match.

Many spectators already saw through Xing Rong’s intentions and couldn’t help but give an inward sigh. This teacher was falling into his trap.

The chess match progressed and the number of pieces on the board dwindled. Apart from their Beast Kings, both parties only had a couple of pieces left.

Xing Rong saw that the moment had come and was prepared to make his killer move.

But just as Xing Rong was confidently preparing his attack to end this game, Ye Qingtang’s next move was to take his Beast King…

Xing Rong was in a daze as he watched his Beast King get swept off the board. The barely-concealed amusement in his eyes was completely dispelled in an instant.

What the hell happened…

How did he lose?

He had already calculated all of Ye Qingtang’s moves. How did he make a mistake?

Every single one of Ye Qingtang’s moves was accurately logged in Xing Rong’s brain. There was nothing exceptional there. How did the ending differ so greatly from what he predicted?

The spectators were all stunned. They had watched so many of Xing Rong’s matches, and this was the first time he had lost.

And from what they had observed…

Ye Qingtang had clearly fallen into Xing Rong’s trap.

“I won.” Ye Qingtang’s tone was mild.

Xing Rong’s face darkened. He must have miscalculated somewhere.

Ye Qingtang had beaten him by one move.

He must have been too careless.

“These are the items which I have lost. Teacher, please take them.” Xing Rong composed himself and put on a nonchalant face.

Ye Qingtang lifted her chin slightly, signaling for Lei Yan to gather up the items.

Xing Rong narrowed his eyes. The Nine Melody Spirit Elixir was still there before his eyes, he would never let go of this chance. Moreover, he had just been careless earlier. He would not give the foolish teacher another chance. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Teacher, I still have quite a number of the items which your disciples lost. Do you plan to win them all back?” Xing Rong smiled.

“Of course,” Ye Qingtang said indifferently.

A hint of a smile flashed across Xing Rong’s eyes.

“Let us continue then.”

Ye Qingtang nodded.

The chess match started again…

The surrounding teenagers were engrossed. Xing Rong was a high-level Illusion Beast Chess player, but this Netherworld Academy teacher was no pushover. It was a close battle and the spectators watched with excitement coursing through their veins.
