1375 Floating Island 2

because ye qingtang was on the last boat to reach the floating island, many dragon court sect disciples had already arrived at the island.

ye qingtang looked around. many of the disciples were important people. even the royal parents of the former prince, who had just entered the dragon court sect, seemed to have arrived at the floating island before them.

it was common to see the monarchs of the various kingdoms on the floating island.

here, the monarchs of the various kingdoms and the elites from anywhere all presented smiling and respectful attitudes towards the dragon court sect’s ambassador on the floating island. rather, it was the men from the dragon court sect who treated these obviously important disciples rather distantly and without any smiles.

ye qingtang was alone, and no one bothered her. she was about to seize the opportunity to look around the floating island and gain some understanding of the dragon court sect, when…

“immortal! immortal!”

ye qingtang had not yet lifted her foot when she heard a familiar voice shouting.

she turned to see the yuan emperor, who should have been in his palace in the yuan kingdom. he emerged from the crowd of disciples, his round belly preceding him, and squeezed himself through the crowd towards ye qingtang.

“…” what was he doing here?

ye qingtang was startled but did not show it.

the short jog caused the yuan emperor to sweat profusely. he walked towards ye qingtang cheerfully, followed by long qi and the others.

“i almost snubbed you because i did not consider the matter properly. how could i allow an immortal to come here by herself? after thinking it over, i felt it was inappropriate, so i brought my men and hurried here through the night.” the yuan emperor looked at ye qingtang jovially.

one must know that the dragon court sect had never approached the yuan kingdom. even though the yuan kingdom, like all the other kingdoms, had presented their offerings every month, they had never obtained any favor from the dragon court sect.

now, the dragon court sect had invited the immortal from their yuan kingdom. it was a rare opportunity, and the yuan emperor was naturally reluctant to miss the chance to interact with the dragon court sect. thus, he had hurried over.

“why have all of you come?” ye qingtang gazed at the sweating yuan emperor and then glanced at long qi and the others who were behind him. then, she realized…

that the yuan empress was here too.

“we missed the last boat, so we sailed here ourselves,” the yuan emperor said with a laugh.

they had received their invitation late, so although they had hurried, they had missed the last boat. fortunately, the yuan kingdom was rich, and the location of the floating island was no secret. since they had missed the boat, they sailed in their own boat.

“…” ye qingtang silently glanced at the yuan emperor. although he was soaking in sweat, the yuan emperor was dressed luxuriously. perhaps he wished to give the dragon court sect a good impression, so he seemed to have worn all his jewels.

ye qingtang saw that the yuan empress was wearing eighteen luminous pearls, each the size of a quail’s egg, on the back of her head. she wondered if the empress’s neck would be crushed anytime soon.

the yuan emperor still wanted to say something to ye qingtang, but his shout had attracted the attention of everyone in the vicinity. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

a middle-aged man dressed in a yellow robe ambled over. one could tell from his crown that he must be an emperor in one of this world’s kingdoms.

“yuan emperor, is this your yuan kingdom’s immortal?” the emperor from another kingdom strolled over with his men. but when he looked at ye qingtang, his expression was unpleasant.
