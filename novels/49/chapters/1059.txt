Chapter 1060 Traitor (3)

Although it had been exterminated a thousand years ago, the reputation of the Blood Moon Sect was still as formidable a thousand years later. As the saying went, a starving camel was still bigger than a horse. Even the three biggest powers of today definitely did not dare to offend the Blood Moon Sect!

Unless all the sects and powerful families in this mainland allied again against a common enemy and completely eradicated the Blood Moon Sect before it had a chance to revive fully.

However, this was impossible. If the Blood Moon Sect revived now, it would still be incredibly powerful. No one was willing to antagonize the Blood Moon Sect. Further, the Blood Moon Sect might not be powerful enough to gain dominance. If it did not impinge on anyone’s interest, who would dare to stick their necks out first and take on the Blood Moon Sect?!

Elder Bai Kui and the Daoist Zijin did not want the Ye Family to be the one to stick its neck out. The Ye Family had just risen to power. If they offended the Blood Moon Sect and was exterminated before they had achieved anything, that would be… a pity… 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Now, Daoist Zijin and Elder Bai Kui made up their minds that no matter what, they would not allow the Eldest Young Lady to kill this Elder Qu. They really had the best intentions for the Ye Family and Eldest Young Lady.

Even if Ye Qingtang was a Yang Lord, no matter how powerful she was, she could not possibly oppose the Blood Moon Sect…

“Eldest Young Lady… please reconsider!”

“Eldest Young Lady, our Ye Family cannot afford to offend the Blood Moon Sect!”

“Eldest Young Lady, right now, there is no need for our Ye Family to offend the Blood Moon Sect!”

A few Ye Family Branch Masters also took the side of Elder Bai Kui and Daoist Zijin and spoke up to persuade her.

The members of the Ye Family did not know Elder Qu’s status and were ignorant of the fact that Elder Qu was a traitor to the Blood Moon Sect. They simply thought that Elder Qu was a member of the Blood Moon Sect.

At that moment, Elder Qu’s lips curved in a slight smile. He had thought of a way to extricate himself.

“Ah… so I have been discovered… I am one of the twenty-four elders of the Blood Moon Sect. If you harm me at all, it will be equivalent to opposing my Blood Moon Sect.” Elder Qu swept a gaze across everyone and smiled coldly.

All the Ye Family members turned pale at Elder Qu’s words. It did not matter whether he was speaking the truth. Even if he was lying, it was inconsequential. But if he was telling the truth and he really was one of the Blood Moon Sect’s twenty-four elders, their Ye Family could not possibly bear the consequences. If the Eldest Young Lady killed a Blood Moon Sect Elder, the Ye Family would probably fall into an abyss from which there was no return. Even Ye Qingtang would probably suffer terrible consequences…“Elder Qu, if you are really one of the Blood Moon Sect’s twenty-four elders, then I could bear witness for you.” Ye Qingtang stared at Elder Qu and smiled coldly. “However, you actually betrayed the Blood Moon Sect and entered the Yunxiao Sect. I suppose you haven’t forgotten about that.”

When they heard Ye Qingtang’s words, Elder Bai Kui, Daoist Zijin, and even all the Ye Family Branch Masters were shocked.

This Blood Moon Sect Elder… was a traitor of the Blood Moon Sect??

“Hmph!” Elder Qu snorted coldly. “Nonsense!”

Although Elder Qu spoke with conviction, he was feeling rather guilty. How did this Yang Lord know about these events?

“Elder Qu, do you recognize me?” Ye Qingtang stared at Elder Qu.

“No.” Elder Qu had already studied Ye Qingtang and found her unfamiliar.

“Since you don’t recognize me… do you recognize this.” Ye Qingtang pointed to her brow, her lips curving upwards.
