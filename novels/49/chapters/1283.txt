Chapter 1284: The Eternal Dynasty (1)

A servant softly walked towards a slender and handsome man and whispered in his ear.

The man’s face was covered by a mask of sorrow, but a trace of joy secretly flashed across his eyes. He did not react and ordered the servant to leave. He sighed softly and walked over to an exquisite-looking girl, who was secretly wiping away her tears.

“Eldest Royal Sister.” The man called softly as he handed her a handkerchief. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The girl took the handkerchief and wiped away the tears at the corners of her eyes. “Eldest Royal Brother… Fourth Royal Brother was just too pitiful. He was only thirteen years old… why…”

These two were the eldest prince of the Eternal Dynasty, Ling Feng, and the eldest princess, Ling Qiong.

Just yesterday, the crown prince of the Eternal Dynasty, the Fourth Prince, had suddenly taken ill and died. Today was the day of the funeral.

The Fourth Prince was the Emperor of the Eternal Dynasty’s youngest son. The Emperor had doted on the Fourth Prince, who was the son of his old age. He even ignored the ministers who felt that the Fourth Prince was too young to be made crown prince. He had insisted, and a month ago, the Fourth Prince was made the crown prince of the Eternal Dynasty.

But no one had expected the Fourth Prince to die suddenly.

The Emperor was deeply grieved. The Fourth Prince’s mother had cried until she was hoarse and exhausted. The other princes and princesses had arrived in the imperial city to participate in the funeral of their young brother.

“Fourth Royal Brother was pitiful. He was so young, why… Eldest Royal Sister, don’t grieve too much, or you might make yourself ill and cause our Royal Father more worry.” Ling Feng comforted her softly.

The Eldest Princess, Ling Qiong, wiped her tears and nodded gently.

There were no traces of tears in Ling Feng’s eyes. He glanced around and said softly in Ling Qiong’s ear, “The guests have arrived.”

A strange look flashed across Ling Qiong’s eyes. Then, she began crying bitterly, as if she had not heard him. She cried so hard that she turned pale.

“Eldest Royal Sister! Eldest Royal Sister!” When Ling Feng saw that Ling Qiong had cried herself into a faint, he scooped her up in shock and hurriedly sought medical attention.

The ministers could not help but sigh when they saw the Eldest Princess cry so bitterly over the death of her brother.

Only one person smiled coldly.

That was a frosty-looking girl, who was extraordinarily beautiful and was enshrouded in an elegant air. She watched as the Eldest Prince and Princess left. There was no amusement in her eyes, only coldness.

“Third Royal Brother, Eldest Royal Sister loved our Fourth Royal Brother so much. Her tears just now were truly heart-wrenching.” The frosty-looking girl suddenly turned to look at a handsome man next to her.

Ling Yan raised his eyes slightly and smiled at the frosty-looking girl, the Second Princess of the Eternal Dynasty, Ling Yue.

“Our Eldest Royal Sister has always doted on her younger brothers and sisters. She must be heartbroken by what happened to the Fourth Prince.”

Ling Yue laughed softly. The chill in her smile deepened as she looked at Ling Yan’s calm countenance.

“Third Royal Brother has always been intelligent. Of course you know the truth behind Fourth Royal Brother’s death. Our Eldest Royal Brother and Sister have always been on good terms. Didn’t they invite Third Royal Brother for a short stay a few days ago? Has Third Royal Brother forgotten that?”

Ling Yan laughed softly, but he did not reply. He glanced at the disappearing figures of the Eldest Prince and Princess from the corner of his eye. Amusement continued to linger in his eyes.

Miss Ye, we are about to meet soon.
