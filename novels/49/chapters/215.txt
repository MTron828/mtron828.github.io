Chapter 214: Skull Tower (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Though the skulls were sprinkled with powder that delayed the decaying process, the degree of decaying of the flesh was still very obvious. Furthermore, the skulls were exposed in the open yard, and the crows that were attracted by the decaying smell pecked the skulls. Among the flesh, pus that came from the decaying matter had covered the entire skulls, making them look extremely disgusting.

However, Ye Qingtang seemed to not notice the disgusting scene. She walked to the skull tower directly and took down the top skull.

The moment the skull was removed, the whole skull tower seemed to experience severe vibrations. The three hundred skulls rolled down and fell beside Ye Qingtang’s feet. Ye Qingtang was surrounded by the hundreds of rotten skulls within a second.

Wu Zheng who remained silent throughout shivered slightly. The horrifying scene was hard to look steadily at.

However…

When Wu Zheng looked up, he was shocked by the young lady who seemed to be standing in a scene of carnage. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The young lady stood among the flesh with the sunlight shining on her. There was no trace of fear on her delicate face. Her eyes were lowered to stare at the rotten skull in her hands. When the sunlight reached her long eyelashes, she appeared so mysterious.

She seemed to be smiling with her lips tilted slightly.

It seemed like…

She was holding a piece of jewelry instead of a disgusting skull.

Ye Qingtang flipped the skull in her hand to have a view of all sides. She just allowed the pus to drop through her fingers freely. She scanned through the skull that belonged to the Village Master Wu Chengze.

Wu Zheng had never met such a young lady before. She could still remain that calm in front of the bloody scenes.

Ye Qingtang stared at the skull for quite a while. She suddenly looked up and asked Wu Zheng who was stunned at the side. “This belongs to Wu Chengze?”

Wu Zheng pulled himself out of astonishment and nodded slightly.

Ye Qingtang did not ask further. She just took a look at the skull again and left it at the side. She then picked up another skull…

“Are you the adopted son of the Village Master?” Ye Qingtang checked through the skull on her hand and asked questions that seemed to be irrelevant.

“Yes.” Wu Zheng answered respectfully. He had to be polite and respectful in front of a sect disciple even if he was the Master’s own son.

“When did you come to the Spirit Condensation Mountain Village?” Ye Qingtang seemed to be asking Wu Zheng, but her sight never left the skulls.

Wu Zheng looked down and said, “When I was still an infant, father brought me back to the village.”

“Where were you when the tragedy happened?” Ye Qingtang looked towards Wu Zheng.

Based on her memory from her previous life, the whole force collapsed after the tragedy. But she had never heard of people mentioning about the adopted son Wu Zheng.

“Father asked me to send the Young Lady of the Dongyue family back. She came for a birthday celebration.” Wu Zheng replied.
