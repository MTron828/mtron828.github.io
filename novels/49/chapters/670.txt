“Don’t worry. I will not use your body again for now. Moreover… I found an even better one.” The little black ball narrowed its eyes in satisfaction as it stared at the snow-white body of the little white tiger.

When they were in the Hell of Avicinaraka previously, the little black ball’s powers were suppressed within the Heart of the Demon God. Even if Ye Qingtang was endangered, it could not appear and break free from that suppression.

Fortunately, they went through the daunting experience without mishaps.

The little lightning dragon’s body was still not powerful enough. Rather, the Fiendcelestial Beast before it…

At that thought, the little black ball shuffled to the little white tiger’s side immediately.

However, just as the little black ball was about to reach the little white tiger, the little white tiger which was originally in deep sleep suddenly opened its eyes! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Almost the same instant when the little white tiger opened its eyes, a powerful demonic air suddenly surged out from its body, and its body enlarged extremely quickly!

“Get lost! Don’t disturb me!” All of a sudden, a large and muscular Fiendcelestial Beast stared at the little black ball that was about the size of a palm. At this very instant, its eyes became especially sharp. Even when it was in the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm, it had never displayed such a sharp bearing before.

The little black ball was dumbfounded instantly. Looking at the Fiendcelestial Beast whose bearing suddenly changed drastically, it was inevitable that it was astounded.

However, before the little black ball took another step, the aura that swelled out from the Fiendcelestial Beast had already awakened Ye Qingtang.

Sitting up absentmindedly, she narrowed her eyes and looked in the direction of the aura.

At the same time when Ye Qingtang rose, the little black ball shuffled into the little lightning dragon’s body at lightning speed.

“…” The little lightning dragon was dumbfounded.

What about the said “will not use your body?!”

In the next second, a ball of light enveloped the little lightning dragon’s body, which suddenly enlarged. When the light faded, the little dragon man with a pair of dragon horns appeared before Ye Qingtang.

“Mother~ Mother~” The little black ball, which took over the little lightning dragon’s body once again, buried its head in Ye Qingtang’s arms as it wriggled around comfortably.

“…” Ye Qingtang looked at the little lightning dragon which suddenly turned into its human form in a daze. A hint of shock flashed across her eyes.

This little fellow had not turned into its human form for a long time, and she almost forgot that it had that ability already.

However, before Ye Qingtang could think why this little fellow suddenly transformed, she looked up instinctively only to see the gigantic Fiendcelestial Beast that covered the entire cave entrance.

The little white tiger which was initially so tiny had now turned into the Fiendcelestial Beast with an imposing aura. Furthermore…

At that very instant, the expression in the Fiendcelestial Beast’s eyes was especially sharp, and its eyes were staring right at the little dragon man in her arms.

“You are…” Ye Qingtang faintly sensed something wrong with the Fiendcelestial Beast. Even when they were in the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm, she had never seen such a serious expression in its eyes before.

The Fiendcelestial Beast narrowed its eyes and subsequently put away all of its aura. Its huge body turned into that tiny little white tiger before Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

“F*ck. I can’t even have a peaceful sleep.” The little white tiger puffed, though its eyes casually swept across the little black ball that was nested in Ye Qingtang’s arms. A cold glint flashed across its eyes. Then, it did not say anything else, strutted away, and went to sleep once again.
