Chapter 422: The Competition (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Yunxiao Sect was Ye You’s biggest prop, and if Yunxiao Sect fell, Ye You would naturally lose a backing. Ye Qingtang knew it was definitely not a simple thing to topple such a powerful Yunxiao Sect, but as long as there was a chance, she would not mind giving them some trouble!

This matter was huge, and she could not act rashly. After seeing Ye You today, Ye Qingtang was aware of the distance between her and Ye You, and the sense of urgency to enter the mystic realm and obtain the Black Heaven Water intensified.

Ye You could advance to Martial Qi Level Three in such a short span of time, and this was definitely related to her blue spirit root.

If Ye Qingtang wanted to chase up to Ye You’s level, the only way was to increase the grade of her spirit root. She must obtain the Black Heaven Water!

…

The next morning, the Three Sect Competition officially began.

Elders and disciples of all sects arrived at the main venue of the competition early in the morning.

The competition this time was split into three categories: martial skills, array formation, and medicine refinement. The level of martial skills was the most important while array formation and medicine refinement were supplementary.

The three categories of the competition were held in three different areas. As a disciple participating in the array formation, the Blood Moon Sect Elder was dragged to the array formation ring by Elder Qin.

Ye Qingtang stood beside the ring for the martial skills competition by herself as her eyes silently landed on Fu Lingtian, who was surrounded by people opposite of her.

There was no emotion on Fu Lingtian’s face, but there was an undetectable arrogance in his eyes. He looked at the competition in the ring coldly in disdain.

The people that the sects sent up initially were mostly the weaker disciples in the team, and the sects were testing the skills of the opposing disciples. The disciples going up last were seated below the ring, including Xuanling Sect’s Zhu Changge. At this instant, he was seated beside Elder Lin, who whispered to Zhu Changge privately as they watched the match, perhaps reminding him on the matters to look out for.

In the Three Sect Competition this year, Xuanling Sect thought most highly of Zhu Changge. Previously, Ye Qingtang suspected whether Zhu Changge was a disciple sent by Yunxiao Sect, but after the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s observation, there was no air of the evil spirit on Zhu Changge’s body.

As the competition continued, the disciples who were sent up later were more powerful.

However, throughout the competition, Xuanling Sect was evidently repressed by Wind Moon Sect and Qinglin Sect, and Xuanling Sect disciples were no match for their opponents in the competition.

The Xuanling Sect elders’ faces darkened.

“It is obvious that the skills of Qinglin Sect and Wind Moon Sect’s disciples are more steady than last year.” Elder Mo frowned. From the current situation, Xuanling Sect was at a disadvantage.

“They’re only slightly more inferior, but the difference is not big. I told Zhu Changge the cultivation techniques of Wind Moon Sect and Qinglin Sect just now so that he can be more careful when he goes up later,” Elder Lin said.

“How does Zhu Changge feel? Does he have the confidence to fight with Fu Lingtian?” Elder Mo asked.

“There shouldn’t be a big problem. Fu Lingtian is at the second stage of the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level One, and so is Zhu Changge. If they were to compare their levels, there shouldn’t be any difference between both of them. As long as Zhu Changge is stable during the match, I believe he has a chance to win.” Elder Lin was rather assured. For this Three Sect Competition, he focused all his energy on training Zhu Changge for nearly half a year.

“That is the best. If we lose again this year, I’m afraid…” Elder Mo did not continue on, but all the elders present knew what followed.
