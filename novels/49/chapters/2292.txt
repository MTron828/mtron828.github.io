Chapter 2293: Returning To The Academy (3)

Just as Di Nuo was planning to have the discipline hall wardens throw this piece of trash out of the Netherworld Academy, Teacher Luo Sheng hurried over.

“Di Nuo, hold on,” Luo Sheng called out.

“Luo Sheng? What are you doing here? The Vice-President gave me full authority to handle Ye Qing’s case. I am about to throw him out of the Netherworld Academy.” Di Nuo frowned.

Luo Sheng glanced at Ye Qing before continuing. “The Vice-President knows that Ye Qing is back and he wants to see him.”

Di Nuo’s face darkened. He could not understand. Ye Qing was merely a Paragon level Sixth Heaven level piece of trash. He was only good at talking. Why was the Vice-President so benevolent toward him?

“Don’t tell me the Vice-President wants to let him off?”

Luo Sheng replied, “The Vice-President just said for you to bring him over. If there is anything else, you can ask him to explain in person.”

Di Nuo’s face looked increasingly grim. He shot Ye Qing a cold look before giving a contemptuous snort. “Never mind. I want to see how the Vice-President will handle Ye Qing’s wrongdoings.”

Luo Sheng’s own face darkened at Di Nuo’s words. But he was an even-tempered fellow and didn’t say anything.

“Ye Qing, come with me to see the Vice-President.” Luo Sheng looked at Ye Qing.

In response, Ye Qing nodded.

Luo Sheng led Ye Qing away and Di Nuo followed.

Inside the Vice-President’s room, Wen Qi was sitting behind the study table. At the sight of Luo Sheng leading Ye Qing and Di Nuo over, his face remained rather impassive.

“Vice-President.” Ye Qingtang nodded at Wen Qi.

Disregarding everything else, Ye Qingtang had a pretty good impression of Wen Qi. He was not as narrow-minded as Di Nuo and knew how to be flexible. He was also willing to research the evolution of martial arts. Ye Qingtang had always respected practitioners like that. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Wen Qi looked at Ye Qing, and a sliver of regret rose in his eyes.

“Ye Qing, why did you take the students out of the academy?” Wen Qi asked.

“I brought them out to train.” Ye Qing replied honestly.

Di Nuo gave a cold smile on hearing Ye Qing’s words.

“Bring them out to train? You?”

Before Ye Qingtang could say anything, Di Nuo turned toward Wen Qi. “Vice-President, let’s put aside the fact that Ye Qing is not an official teacher of the Netherworld Academy. Even if he was, with his powers, he is not qualified to bring students out for training. With his mediocre cultivation level, there is no way he can protect the students should they meet with danger outside. He would even become a burden.”

Yes, the teachers of the Netherworld Academy could bring students out for training, but they had to possess a certain level of skill.

Academies were different from sects. When training outside, they would do their best to ensure the safety of their students. They would not expose them to any life-threatening dangers.

Any teacher who wished to bring students out for training had to be of a certain level. And apart from the medicine faculty, all the Netherworld Academy teachers were powerful enough. And so everyone paid little attention to this point.

But Ye Qing’s powers… were completely inadequate.

“He is overly arrogant and does not know his place. In bringing his students out for training, he is treating their lives like a game. Vice-President, going by skill level or character, this person is not fit to be a teacher at the Netherworld Academy. I hope Vice-President will think carefully for the sake of our academy.” Di Nuo’s every word was dripping with venom towards Ye Qing.
