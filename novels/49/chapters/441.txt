Chapter 442: Breakthrough (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

After returning to her room, Ye Qingtang held her breath in deep concentration and placed the “Mind and Heart Pill” into her mouth.

The “Mind and Heart Pill” dissolved the moment it entered her mouth, and a searing breath entered her meridians immediately.

Ye Qingtang closed her eyes and felt the flow of the inner qi in her body. The inner qi was like an ocean while her body was a dry desert which absorbed everything in a second.

The effect of the Mind and Heart Pill was shocking and was the best for cultivators at Martial Qi Level One.

Usually, normal cultivators would require at least more than one month to fully absorb the effects of the Mind and Heart Pill.

However, Ye Qingtang had the Heart of the Demon God. Using it as a carrier, her initial calculations were that it would only require a few hours for the full effects of the Mind and Heart Pill to be absorbed.

“One night… One night and I will be able to make a breakthrough to Martial Qi Level Two…” Ye Qingtang considered internally.

She was already not far away from Martial Qi Level Two, and with this Mind and Heart Pill now, the speed of her breakthrough would increase as if given help from heaven.

Time passed. It seemed like the blink of an eye yet also an entire century.

Suddenly, there was a thunder in the sky above where Ye Qingtang’s residence and spirit energy escalated rapidly as though it was forming a nation of spirit energy. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

All of the Xuanling Sect and Wind Moon Sect people were alarmed.

“Someone is about to break through to Martial Qi Level Two?!”

A Wind Moon Sect elder walked out from his room and looked in the direction of Xuanling Sect’s residence in astonishment.

It was impossible to be an elder as every sect elder was above Martial Qi Level Two…

“Someone is Xuanling Sect is actually breaking through to Martial Qi Level Two. Who is that?” another Wind Moon Sect elder asked, astounded.

“Judging by that direction… that disciple…. of Elder Mo?!”

...…

On Xuanling Sect’s side, Elder Qin was the first to be alarmed while Elder Mo was a step later. Both of them exited their rooms and scanned the sky.

“There’s actually a disciple from our sect who is about to break through to Martial Qi Level Two?!” Elder Qin asked, extremely surprised.

“This intensity of spirit energy…” Elder Mo was astounded. For normal cultivators, there would also be a condensation of spirit energy when breaking through to Martial Qi Level Two from Martial Qi Level one.

However, the intensity of the condensation of spirit energy was more than double of normal cultivator’s!

Even when Elder Mo made a breakthrough back then, the intensity of the spirit energy was far less than it was currently!

“Which disciple is it?” Elder Mo had a look of confusion.

“Ye… Ye Qingtang!” Elder Qin pointed to not far away.

“Qingtang?!” Elder Mo looked at where Ye Qingtang was staying in, and there was spirit energy lingering around it as though there was a nation of spirit energy. The rich spirit energy rushed into Ye Qingtang’s room like surging waves.

“She… she is charging towards Martial Qi Level Two!” Elder Mo’s eyes dilated abruptly.

“That’s right. And looking at the intensity of the spirit energy, your precious disciple is about to succeed,” Elder Qin said.

“Protect Qingtang!” Expressions of shock were written all over Elder Mo’s face as he subsequently flew above Ye Qingtang’s room.

A cultivator must not be disrupted when charging towards a realm. Once it was stopped, the consequences would be dire.

“Okay!” Elder Qin nodded and flew into the void, standing beside Elder Mo.

An hour later, all the spirit energy in the void was completely absorbed by Ye Qingtang.

“Martial Qi Level Two…”

In the room, Ye Qingtang sat cross-legged at her bedside as the corners of her lips tugged up slightly. “Martial Qi Level Two… Second Heaven…”

Even Ye Qingtang herself did not expect that all the spirit energy in the void would be absorbed by the Heart of the Demon God, which acted as a carrier, without missing a tiny bit. And exactly because of the Heart of the Demon God, not only did she succeed in charging towards Martial Qi Level Two in a few hours, she even advanced by two small realms and directly rose to the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two!
