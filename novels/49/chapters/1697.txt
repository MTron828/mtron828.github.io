Chapter 1698: I Am Beating You (2)

“What...” The smile on Baili Xuanyun’s face froze.

Somehow... Ye Qingtang didn’t die under the lightning strikes. Although she was wounded by the lightning, her gaze remained sharp as a knife. The sword in her hand morphed into a cold light, and as Baili Xuanyun stood there still in a daze, she stabbed the beam of light straight into his shoulder.

It was apparent Baili Xuanyun never expected Ye Qingtang to survive the Thunderbolt Rage. He was totally caught off-guard by her sudden attack.

The beam of light pierced straight through Baili Xuanyun’s shoulder.

Before Baili Xuanyun could recompose himself, the sword in Ye Qingtang’s hand dissolved into countless pins of light, which pierced all over Baili Xuanyun’s body.

WhatーHow could this be?

Baili Xuanyun’s heart turned cold. He suddenly realized that Ye Qingtang’s speed and power was far higher than before. This was not the kind of ability achievable by a fighter who had just ascended the Fourth Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate realm!

The stricken Baili Xuanyun hurriedly tried to counterattack. But in a matter of seconds, he was so gravely injured that his movements were stunted, while Ye Qingtang moved increasingly faster.

How was this even possible?!

Just as Baili Xuanyun was at a loss at how to handle her, Ye Qingtang suddenly leaped into the air. In between the flashes of lightning and rolls of thunder, her slender frame dove straight down and she landed one vicious kick right on Baili Xuanyun’s head.

Bam! Baili Xuanyun felt like his head was being split into half by a tremendous force. Fresh blood gushed from his mouth. His tall, strapping body staggered backwards.

Everyone’s eyes widened in shock at this unbelievable turn of events. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

What kind of joke was this?

A fighter who had just ascended the Fourth Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate realm gravely injuring an opponent who was already at the advanced stage?

Elder Baili’s arrogant face instantly darkened when he saw Baili Xuanyun spurting blood from his lips.

And yet, before Elder Baili could regain his composure, Ye Qingtang increased her speed yet again!

Baili Xuanyun had yet to stabilize himself when Ye Qingtang appeared behind him. She launched a heavy kick at his back, nearly breaking the bones in Baili Xuanyun’s body.

At this point, Baili Xuanyun’s mind was filled with an intense buzzing sound. He could not figure out how Ye Qingtang managed to dodge his Thunderbolt Rage attack, and how she could suddenly increase her speed by so much!

Baili Xuanyun could not understand it at all. Moreover, he had no time to think.

Tossing her sword aside, Ye Qingtang attacked Baili Xuanyun with her bare fists. This simple knuckle-on-flesh attack made Baili Xuanyun look utterly weak and ridiculous.

If Ye Qingtang had used some secret technique, he could still find some excuse for his defeat. But she was just using basic kicks and punches, and still managing to beat Baili Xuanyun to a pulp.

Advanced stage of the Fourth Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate realm? So what? He was now defenceless against the fists of a new Fourth Heaven level fighter. This was totally unbelievable.

High up in her seating area, Mu Ruxue had turned pale when she saw this familiar attack method. Her clenched fists started to tremble uncontrollably.

That day, Ye Qingtang had used this exact same basic attack to beat her up!

History had a startling way of repeating itself.
