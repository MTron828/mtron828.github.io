Chapter 1755: Encampment (2)

“What are you still standing there in shock for? You want to run into those bastards from the West? Get lost,” the fiendish demon snapped impatiently.

Ye Qingtang stood up straight as she started understanding what was going on around her.

She had thought that it was normal how the fiendish demons in this valley were constantly fighting but now felt that maybe that wasn’t the case.

Based on what this fiendish demon had said, the demons seemed to belong to different camps. The ones who had attacked her previously seemed to be from the western camp, while the one standing right in front of her seemed to be from the eastern camp.

The fiendish demons all looked extremely different here and the sheer number of them were shocking as well. There was no way they were able to differentiate members of the different camps based on looks alone.

The only possibility was that they were doing it by smell, to differentiate their peers.

The blood that Ye Qingtang had smeared on herself previously was probably from a fiendish demon belonging to the eastern camp.

Ye Qingtang breathed a sigh of relief as her disguise hadn’t been seen through. But she had underestimated the situation here. The fiendish demons here had split themselves up into camps. Even if they were all demons, they wouldn’t hesitate to kill a demon from the other camp.

Ye Qingtang was currently in the western territory. The fiendish demons from the different camps were fighting constantly to gain more territory.

To think that she had made such an unexpected mistake and wandered into enemy territory. Now she was alone as well and had caught the eye of this demon.

If the fiendish demon in front of her hadn’t thought that she was from their camp and ripped the other demon apart, Ye Qingtang would have died such a wronged death.

Looking at the haughty demon in front of her, Ye Qingtang didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

The fiendish demon was so powerful that they must look like trash in front of it. No wonder he stared at them in disgust. He was so close to calling them weaklings.

“Who let you come to the western territory? What a hindrance. Follow me back to the eastern cave at once.” The fiendish demon in front of Ye Qingtang hadn’t realized that she wasn’t one of them. He thought that like him, they were little demons wearing a human skin.

Little demons were usually demons which had just been birthed. They were usually protected by the camps and weren’t allowed to leave, so he had no idea why these rascals had come all the way here.

Ye Qingtang’s heart fell as she heard his words. She thought that she had finally managed to escape and felt a sense of foreboding hearing that she was about to go back to the demon camp.

However...

She didn’t dare to reveal herself here as she might die a horrible death.

“Alright...” Ye Qingtang could only reply obediently, fearful that her cover would be blown.

The fiendish demon had no patience at all and scooped Ye Qingtang up by her collar. He frowned as he realized that she was holding onto two other creatures. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“What trash have you been eating? No wonder you’re so weak. Stop eating these useless things in the future. Follow me into a few more fights and devour some demon blood so that you can become stronger. These things won’t even be enough to fill you up.”

The fiendish demon had assumed that the Little White Tiger and the Little Heavenly Demon were food that Ye Qingtang had caught.
