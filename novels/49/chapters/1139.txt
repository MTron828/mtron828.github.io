Chapter 1140: Shell (2)

“Ha...” An icy smile appeared on Blood Moon Holy Lord’s face. “Withdrawing your soul and leaving your body behind... Han Cangming... this lives up to your name as the Demon God...”

However, just as Blood Moon Holy Lord spoke, the sealed Han Cangming suddenly flashed a wicked smile. The pair of distant eyes were now coated by a devilish charm, and even his cold face was more devilish now!

It was as if Han Cangming’s demeanor changed completely in an instant.

Han Cangming’s eyes slowly landed on Blood Moon Holy Lord as he laughed lightly. “Heavenly Brother, it’s not too nice to bully my shell like this, isn’t it?”

“You’re here...” Blood Moon Holy Lord sized up Han Cangming once again when he heard that familiar tone.

“After knowing what happened to you back then, I’ve already predicted that I would be next. Thus, I withdrew my soul to be reincarnated. This body is only left behind to trick the Heavenly Dao. There’s no need to be surprised,” Han Cangming said with a laugh.

“Since that’s the case, why did you instruct your shell to hinder me?” The Blood Moon Holy Lord asked coldly.

“Heavenly Brother... You should know that the Heart of the Heavenly Dao has not been nurtured successfully and will be reincarnated endlessly. What can you do even if you kill Ye Qingtang today? After Ye Qingtang dies, she will be reincarnated once again, and she would still become a new holder until the Heart of the Heavenly Dao is nurtured successfully. Otherwise, there is no end.” Han Cangming answered.

“If that’s the case, I’ll kill her every time she is reincarnated,” said the Blood Moon Holy Lord. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“But Ye Qingtang is innocent,” Han Cangming said with a smile.

“Innocent?” Blood Moon Holy Lord’s eyes turned cold. “The Heart of the Heavenly Dao is in her body, and she is a holder. If I kill her, the owner of the Heart of the Heavenly Dao will have wasted his efforts and can only let her be reincarnated again to become a new holder. This is my revenge on the Heavenly Dao... Furthermore, she will live a desolate life even if she lives. Why not die and not have to suffer?”

“Hahaha...” Han Cangming laughed suddenly, but his eyes turned extremely cold at that instant.

“Heavenly Brother, I think that you’re too full of yourself... You hate the owner of the Heart of the Heavenly Dao, but why must you put all the blame on Miss Ye?”

“You said that her being alive is suffering itself, but I feel that she is living very well. You think that this is being good do her, but have you ever asked about her opinion? Furthermore, you and Miss Ye don’t seem to be related.”

The Blood Moon Holy Lord was silent.

The woman he loved the most had already died a long time ago, and even if Ye Qingtang was the reincarnation of his most beloved woman, their souls were completely different...

They were two independent individuals...

The reincarnation of a dead person was totally different from the person before death—this was the law of the world.

As an Emperor-level figure, the Heavenly Emperor naturally understood this logic.

“Heavenly Brother... You treated that lady as your wife, but has she ever loved you? The only thing she cared about was martial power. She was even unwilling to give up on the Heart of the Heavenly Dao and believed that the Heart of the Heavenly Dao would bring her immense power. So be it if that kind of person dies. She is not worthy of such treatment from you,” Han Cangming said.

The Blood Moon Holy Lord was silent.

As Han Cangming had said, although they were married by name, they were unlike husband and wife... It was such that even the woman he loved dearly had never loved him.

“So what!”

Two blood-colored light beams suddenly shot out of the Blood Moon Holy Lord’s eyes.
