Ye Qingtang did not say anything as she stretched her hand with the Xuanming points bracelet to the warden.

The warden looked at that bracelet doubtingly and attempted to draw the number of Xuanming points required away. In the end… fifteen thousand Xuanming points were instantly drawn away.

The warden could not help but be taken aback.

She really has so many points?!

“Is it done?” Ye Qingtang asked as she placed her hand down after seeing fifteen thousand Xuanming points being drawn away.

The warden fell into a trance and only returned to his senses sometime later. “Yes.”

A few inner sect disciples heard the warden’s words, and their eyes almost popped out.

This junior sister from the outer sect really had fifteen thousand Xuanming points?!

The warden handed Ye Qingtang a waist tablet and finally allowed her in.

Until Ye Qingtang entered the Spirit Consonance River, the warden still could not understand where this outer sect disciple got so many Xuanming points, while the inner sect disciples still had incredulous expressions on their faces.

“When did the outer sect produce such a crazy disciple who would actually use five times the price to use the Spirit Consonance River?”

“So what if she used it? Her foundation is not stable, and it will not be easy to gain great advancements,” the inner sect disciples mumbled as they left.

Passing through the Spirit Consonance River entrance and stepping on the layers of clouds, one could hear the sound of flowing water in the vast expanse of white mist.

A glistening stream appeared before Ye Qingtang’s eyes. The entire Spirit Consonance River was one thousand meters long, winding between the clouds. Its aquamarine river was sparkling with tiny ripples, and threads of mist drifted above the river. At the bottom of the Spirit Consonance River were shiny gemstones embedded on the riverbed. As the river flowed, strong spirit energy was produced.

Before Ye Qingtang entered the Spirit Consonance River, she already felt the surging spirit energy.

Ye Qingtang took a step into the clear river, and a warm sensation immediately passed through her clothes and spread all over her body. Her body was clearly in the Spirit Consonance River, but her clothes were not wet at all. Her skin could clearly feel the river water brushing past her, but when she raised her hand, the sleeve that was previously soaked in the water was completely dry.

At that time of the day, the Spirit Consonance River was empty, and only Ye Qingtang was in it. She looked at the end of the river flow and caught sight of a cascading spring at the semicircle river bank. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Ye Qingtang eyes brightened instantly, and she headed towards the spring without hesitation.

The Spirit Consonance River was not deep and only reached Ye Qingtang’s waist. Thus, there was no resistance when walking in the water.

There was an abundance of spirit energy throughout the entire Spirit Consonance River, but the richest spot was the spring at the end of the river!

Ye Qingtang had only gone to the Spirit Consonance River once in her previous life but heard some rumors about the Spirit Consonance River: The spring was the richest in spirit energy and had double the amount of spirit energy in other parts of the river.

However…

Not anyone had the luck to go there.

On usual days, the inner sect elites would head there early and hog the best spots.

Ye Qingtang felt that she was pretty lucky today. There was not a soul here, and she would naturally not stand on ceremony.
