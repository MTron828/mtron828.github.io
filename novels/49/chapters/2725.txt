Chapter 2726: Returning To Her Era (4)

Ye Qingtang’s gaze landed on the big yellow dog and she could not help frowning. The big yellow dog found her a little familiar?

Could it be that in that distant era, history had changed because of her?

“Where have you seen me before?” Ye Qingtang asked the big yellow dog.

“Where?” The big yellow dog stared at Ye Qingtang and pondered for a moment before shaking its head. “I forgot.”

Ye Qingtang, “...”

Rolling her eyes, she looked at the yellow dog and the Blood Moon Elder and chuckled. “By the way, have you heard of Ye Yue?”

The yellow dog replied, “I’ve never heard of her.”

“Ye Yue?” The Blood Moon Elder lowered his head and pondered for a long time with a puzzled expression.

“Holy Lady, this name... I seem to have heard it somewhere before. It sounds very familiar but I can’t seem to...” The Blood Moon Elder muttered.

“It’s alright. I was just asking casually.” Ye Qingtang smiled.

After a short while, the Blood Moon Elder looked up in shock. He said hurriedly, “Holy Lady, are you talking about... Ye Yue... Saint Ye Yue?!”

Ye Qingtang was stunned.

In that distant era when she became a disciple of the Great Immortal Temple and the personal disciple of the Nine Heavens Saint, she had indeed been called Saint Ye Yue.

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang nodded. “Yes.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Holy Lady, no way. Why would you suddenly ask about Saint Ye Yue? Holy Lady, do you know that this name is taboo in the Divine Venerate Domain...” The Blood Moon Elder said mysteriously.

“Oh? Tell me more.” Ye Qingtang was filled with curiosity.

“Holy Lady, I’m not too sure either. I just heard rumors. However, if you are interested, I can tell you.” The Blood Moon Elder stared at Ye Qingtang. “Saint Ye Yue existed 10,000 years ago and was one of the most legendary figures in the Divine Venerate Domain.”

“Legendary figure?” Ye Qingtang was surprised.

“Legendary figure? How legendary? More legendary than me?” The big yellow dog wagged its tail.

Ye Qingtang glanced at the big yellow dog. She felt a strong urge to slap it. She still remembered that she was nearly killed by a fireball caused by the big yellow dog when she first met it in that distant era.

“Saint Ye Yue was the most beloved disciple of the Nine Heavens Saint of the Great Immortal Temple 10,000 years ago. It is said that Saint Ye Yue became an Immortal Emperor at a young age in that era and was the junior with the strongest potential in the Great Immortal Temple. She was almost invincible among her peers!” The Blood Moon Elder was full of admiration. “Not only that but Saint Ye Yue was also known as an elixir pioneer. She developed many elixir-refinement skills, the palm flame and all sorts of elixirs by herself. She was considered an unparalleled genius!”

Ye Qingtang looked a little embarrassed. She felt somewhat embarrassed to take on the title “elixir pioneer”...

“Later on, the demons under the Great Immortal Temple were about to break out of the seal. Saint Ye Yue found the Paragon Relic by herself and suppressed those demons. If not for Saint Ye Yue, the Great Immortal Temple would have ceased to exist by now,” the Blood Moon Elder said.

“Are you saying that the Great Immortal Temple still exists now?” An inexplicable glint surfaced in Ye Qingtang’s eyes.
