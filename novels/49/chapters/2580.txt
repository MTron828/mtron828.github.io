Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang fell into deep thought.

After Ye Qingtang knew what era she was in, she was indeed a little excited, and still in disbelief. All legends, miracles and the unexpected were basically born in this era.

Just the sound of it would make one’s blood surge with excitement. But after some careful thought, she was just an ordinary Divine Lord. No matter how exciting this era was, it had nothing to do with her.

Of course, Ye Qingtang did not want to get involved herself. In such an era, she would be very satisfied if she could personally witness the birth of those legends and miracles, some of which had not even been recorded in history.

But then came another question.

How would she return?

‘The Ancient God Karma Tunnel was indeed profound and endless, but this mysterious and infinite Tunnel didn’t tell her how she could retumn to her own era, nor did it tell her the time limit.

Based on what the big yellow dog had said before, unless you ended up in the doomed hell, one could return if they were in a blessed paradise or unknown land. But now, she had no idea how to do that.

However, she had just arrived at this brand new era, so there was no point in thinking too much. As for when she could return to her own era, she could only take things one step at a time.

“Sister Qingtang, this is for you.’ The young Feng Jiuyou wiped his hands and took out an herb. He then handed it to Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang recognized this herb. It was called “Dream Searching Grass’ and was a very rare herb.

“Sister Qingtang, you saved me. I don’t know how to repay you.” The young Feng Jiuyou smiled at Ye Qingtang. “I spent a lot of effort to secretly get this herb.”

“No need. It was a piece of cake for me to save you just now. Furthermore, this herb of yours is useless to me. Keep it for yourself.” Ye Qingtang looked at Feng Jiuyou and smiled. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Feng Jiuyou was deep in thought after hearing Ye Qingtang’s words. After a while, he said, “Sister Qingtang, you previously said that you are not a native and are unfamiliar with this place. So, where are you planning to go”

“where.”

Ye Qingtang scanned her surroundings.

She did not know where she should go. She had only thought about re-entering the Ancient God Karma Tunnel, but now the tunnel had transported her to this past era. Ye Qingtang did not know what her next step would be.

Although she was no stranger to this world, the people she was familiar with had not been bom yet. Especially since she was in the Third Domain and had never visited the Divine Venerate Domain before, she was very unfamiliar with everything there.

“Lwonder if there is any way to obtain the power of the Heart of the Heavenly Dao in this era,” Ye Qingtang thought to herself.

Seeing Ye Qingtang remain silent, the young Feng Jiuyou tugged at the corner of her clothes and smiled, “Sister Qingtang, do you want to come home with me? Sister Qingtang, please come to my house as a guest.”

After pondering for a moment, Ye Qingtang finally nodded and agreed. There should not be any problem visiting Feng Jiuyou’s house.

The most important thing now was to find a place to settle down and figure out the situation of this era. Otherwise, she would be like a headless fly wandering around the Divine Venerate Domain. If she was not careful, she might even lose her life..
