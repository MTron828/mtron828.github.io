Chapter 1634: Fight (3)

Jiang Yisheng was the first to move. His palm struck Jiang Yiran’s shoulder with an explosive force. The aftershock rippled through the air, sending the crowd’s hair flying.

But Jiang Yiran did not budge. He simply absorbed the blow, then narrowed his eyes smugly, and said with a smile, “No need to stand on ceremony. I can still take it.”

Jiang Yisheng’s expression changed.

He had used his full force to deliver this blow! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

But Jiang Yiran just shrugged and said, “My turn.”

With that, Jiang Yiran stepped forward and casually hit Jiang Yisheng’s shoulder.

The moment Jiang Yiran moved, Ye Qingtang, who was standing in the crowd, could not help but frown.

The moment the blow landed, Jiang Yisheng’s body shuddered. He tried to summon the strength to withstand the blow, but as he struggled, he felt blood rushing into his throat. He stumbled and moved back a step.

Jiang Yiran laughed. When he looked at Jiang Yisheng, who had retreated a step, the amusement in his eyes deepened.

“You should be grateful. If Elder Brother Yun had dealt that blow, you would be lying on the ground right now.”

Jiang Yisheng could sense his Qi churning in his chest, and he was ashen. He thought that his abilities were among the best in the valley, but now...

“What are you doing.” A cold voice suddenly rang in everyone’s ears.

Jiang Yiran, who had been smiling arrogantly, immediately wiped the cynical expression off his face when he heard the voice.

He turned towards the voice, only to see a chilly-looking youth with an imposing air. He stood with his hands behind his back as he watched the farce.

The youth did not say anything more, but he exerted great pressure on the surroundings with his aura.

“Elder Brother Yun!” Jiang Yiran, who had acted so arrogantly, froze when he saw this youth.

This youth was Jiang Yanyun, currently the most powerful youth in Taiyuan Valley.

The group of youths, who had encouraged Jiang Yisheng to challenge Jiang Yanyun, were now stricken dumb when they saw Jiang Yanyun.

Jiang Yanyun glanced expressionlessly at the crowd. His frosty gaze passed over them without seeming to stop on anyone before finally resting on Jiang Yiran.

As Jiang Yanyun looked at him, Jiang Yiran broke into a cold sweat.

“Waste of time,” Jiang Yanyun said blandly and then turned to leave.

Jiang Yiran secretly gulped before heaving a sigh of relief.

But at that moment, Jiang Yisheng suddenly spoke up. “Jiang Yanyun, I will challenge you before the Martial Arts Championship!”

Jiang Yanyun’s footsteps paused, but his hands that were clasped behind his back remained motionless.

Jiang Yiran, who was standing nearby, goggled. He knew that Jiang Yisheng was a stubborn fellow and rather stupid, but... he was getting too used to seeking out these fatal encounters.

Jiang Yanyun slowly turned around, and his cold gaze swept across Jiang Yisheng.

It was just one look, but Jiang Yisheng felt as if he had fallen into an icy dungeon. A bone-piercing chill filled him. At some point, Jiang Yanyun had begun emitting an oppressive aura, so Jiang Yisheng sweated profusely just to force himself to meet Jiang Yisheng’s look.

After a moment, Jiang Yisheng looked away in embarrassment. He did not dare to look at Jiang Yanyun again.

Jiang Yanyun also looked away and continued on his way without a word.

At that moment, Jiang Yisheng looked rather abashed, and the expressions of the other youths were even uglier.
