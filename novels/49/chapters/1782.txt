Chapter 1783: Blood Battle (3)

The battle went on for so long they had already lost track of the time as the battlefield became littered with an endless number of forgotten corpses. The fiendish demons trampled on the bodies of their comrades as they rushed forward killing everything in their path.

After sacrificing countless fiendish demons, the defenses of the three tribes were finally breached! The demons from the different factions and camps instantly went on a slaughtering spree.

Ye Qingtang was going to use this chaos to escape, but before she could do so, a blood-soaked Ba grabbed her and rushed towards the opened sealed space along with most of the demons.

“What’re you standing there for? Get in!” Ba reproached her.

Ye Qingtang was speechless. Couldn’t he just spare her? She had no intention of taking part in the demons’ battles and had absolutely no interest in the Deity Ocean...

But the demon’s power was not something Ye Qingtang could go against and without giving her a chance to protest, Ba dragged her straight towards the sealed space. The rough and tumble felt as though she was about to be thrown off!

It was like another world inside the sealed space. It was pitch black inside and the whistling cold wind blew at them relentlessly, carrying with it the thick stench of blood.

There had obviously already been a battle inside this sealed space.

The three tribes that had entered the sealed space were going to start battling inside again.

Demons from the other factions flooded in, frantically searching for the location of the Deity Ocean. As Ye Qingtang followed Ba, she spotted Hu among the crowd of demons.

Hu’s human skin had already been torn in the battle and his hands had sustained deep wounds as well. He looked slightly pathetic.

“The Great General has already said that we have to obtain the Deity Ocean this time, or all the demons in our camp are going to die.”

To rebel against the elite three tribes was to openly declare battle to the death with them. The three tribes were going to seek their revenge if they didn’t obtain the Deity Ocean.

How could they possibly be a match for the three elite tribes?

Ye Qingtang could only think about using this opportunity to escape from the sealed space but at that moment, the entrance was filled with countless demons flooding in. There was no way she could leave.

“That’s the Deity Ocean!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Just as Ye Qingtang was thinking about a way to get out of her predicament, a shout came from in front of him.

Almost immediately, Ba and Hu dragged Ye Qingtang straight towards the noise.

In the void above the mountain peak in front of then, a light shone through the originally dark sky. The shining blue lights were slowly forming into a line!

In that instant, the scattered lights suddenly gathered together and formed a bright moon which hung over all the demons’ heads!

The Deity Ocean had been formed!

Ye Qingtang’s heart trembled as she looked at the bright blue orb from afar. The Deity Ocean seemed to emanate an aura so strong it affected all the demons.

The demons from the three elite tribes on the mountain peak had already occupied the vital positions. Their expressions twisted as they looked at the other demons flooding the base of the mountain.

The three elite tribes had never imagined that these useless troops would be able to breach their defenses. Now that the Deity Ocean was right in front of them, how could they possibly let these other demons even touch it?
