Chapter 802 Emperor Dowager (3)

“Bullsh*t! I don’t even know about the rotting bone powder!” The Emperor Dowager scoffed.

“How dare you to frame my mother, rabble! Mother only loves and cares for father. She brings food here every day. How dare you frame her!” The little Emperor shouted in

anger.

Ye Qingtang did not bother with her quibble. She asked the Blood Moon Elder to bring a plant over.

Ye Qingtang then poured the porridge slowly onto the plant.

However, nothing happened to that charming flower.

A trace of sarcasm flashed across the Emperor Dowager’s eyes.

“What else do you have to say?” She sneered.

“Wait.” Ye Qingtang put down the empty bowl and then took a glass of sake.

A panic look flashed across the Emperor Dowager’s eyes suddenly.

“I heard that the Grand Emperor likes to drink alcohol, especially the Qingyu sake from the Northern part’s tribute, and that he takes a glass every day after his meal… Do you still have this habit in recent years?” Ye Qingtang looked towards the Grand Emperor and asked.

The Grand Emperor nodded.

The Qingyu sake was not what he loved but what she loved.

Now, the beauty was long gone…

He could only recall some moments when he took the Qingyu sake.

“It’s always been like that.” He responded.

Ye Qingtang lifted her hand and poured the Qingyu sake onto the plant.

The moment when sake landed on the petals, the bright flower suddenly lost its color and wilted in front of everyone.

“This…” A trace of astonishment flashed across the Grand Emperor’s eyes, Though the Emperor Dowager was not his true love, he did not mistreat her after marrying her for more than a decade. He did not expect that…

She would be the one who poisoned him!

The Emperor Dowager closed her eyes slowly and sighed when she saw that the flower wilted.

“The rotting bone powder is a strong poison, but it hides in the body. It can only be triggered when you take the guiding drug along. Thus… even if someone suspects something, as long as one did not mix these two, one would never find out about the poison inside.” Ye Qingtang held the empty glass and looked at the Emperor Dowager, whose face was pure.

“Emperor Dowager… why do you want to poison me.” Pain filled the Grand Emperor’s eyes. Though he did not love her, he treated her like his little sister all the time.

The Emperor Dowager opened her eyes and scoffed.

“Poison you? Are you the victim or I am the one!”

“Mother…” The little Emperor was shocked. He could never imagine that his most respected father would be poisoned by his own mother.

The Emperor Dowager did not hide anything since the truth was revealed.

“When you were enthroned and married with me back then, I thought that you would treat me with your true love. However… after you met that woman, you lost your soul, and your eyes could not contain anyone else. My most beautiful years were wasted in your hands… I am the victim! You confined me in this cold palace for my entire life.”

The Grand Emperor stared at the Emperor Dowager with grievances.

“I asked about your opinion previously. If you were not willing to be my wife, I would send you out of the palace till you found a suitable one… It was you… who was not willing to leave…”

“Leave? Why? I am the mother of the country! The Empress of the Nine Nights Dynasty! Why would I leave the palace!” The Emperor Dowager scoffed.

“You…” The Grand Emperor stared at the Emperor Dowager in front of her. He remembered that when she just entered the palace, he treated her as his little sister as she was still young. However…

The little sister had such ambitions all the time.
