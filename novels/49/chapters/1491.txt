Chapter 1492 Overreaching 1

The Cyclops Demon King was the only one among all the Demon Kings that could understand some human speech. His speech was stiff, but his tone was very hostile.

This big demon belonged to their Demon Clan. It had nothing to do with humans and other clans even after it was dead!

Everyone present frowned when they heard the Cyclops Demon King’s words.

The moment the Cyclops Demon King finished speaking, a clear voice suddenly rang out from the Ancient You Clan’s golden sedan.

“What a joke. Does the Land of Infinite Demons belong to the Demon Clan? On what basis do you order us to leave?”

The voice sounded fairly young. They did not know who was inside the sedan, but at that moment, it spoke for all the human clans present.

They had come to the Land of Infinite Demons for the sake of the big demon, yet now the Demon King wanted them to leave?

He could dream on!

“If you refuse to leave... don’t blame us for not holding back anymore...” The leather armor on the Cyclops Demon King’s back suddenly rose, and a strong demonic aura started to spread around him.

“You cannot possibly expect us to leave. If you want to fight, we’ll fight you to the end.” Jiang Shangyu, who had yet to speak, suddenly leaped upwards into the void. He looked down on the group of Demon Kings from his vantage point and spoke coldly.

In recent times, there had been much friction between the Ancient You Clan and the Jiang Family. But at that moment, no matter what dissension there was between these human powers, they would certainly present a united front before these alien races and the Demon Kings.

The Ancient You Clan and the Domain Monarch’s Jiang Family had already made their stance clear. The other powers also had similar intentions.

As for the Temple of Shadows, the tribe leaders looked on coolly without saying anything. However, these alien races probably had the same intentions.

It would be no easy task for the Demon King to force them to leave.

The big demon’s flesh and grave goods were so enticing. Why would anyone leave?

The Cyclops Demon King let out a low roar of rage. The other Demon Kings’ expressions also grew sinister. The horde of small demons gave a deafening bellow that shook the heavens, and the entire mountain range seemed to quiver at the sound.

The Ancient You Clan, the Jiang Family, and the other human forces did not pale in comparison. In a moment, spirit energy filled the air, and rays of light shone among the humans. The two forces collided in midair; it seemed as though an interracial bloodbath would begin at any moment.

Ye Qingtang remained calm as she looked at this volatile situation.

“Tang Tang, don’t be scared.” Jiang Xun was worried that Ye Qingtang would be shocked by the radiating power, and spoke to console her.

Ye Qingtang nodded obediently, but her voice did not waver.

“Grand Aunt, I’m not afraid.”

Ye Qingtang had lived three hundred years in her previous life. How could a battle like this frighten her?

Although the Demon Kings and the human forces seemed all set for a showdown, a closer look revealed that neither side would act rashly.

These intimidation techniques merely kept both sides in check and on their toes.

It was actually an impasse. Neither the humans, the aliens, nor the Demon Kings would be the first to start the battle. It would be best if the opponent could be intimidated into retreating.

But then, the unexpected happened. Ye Qingtang was watching the powerful forces spoiling for a fight and shouting furiously at each other, but in the void above, those from the Second Domain were looking impatient.

“Bunch of beasts. What is there to talk about? We certainly want that big demon.” A tall man from the Second Domain suddenly laughed frostily. He rushed downwards, attempting to leap over the Demon Kings and head towards the body of the big demon.
