Chapter 1736: A Bewitching Melody (1)

Before Ye Qingtang had time to think about this, the monster from the ice gave a piercing roar. It shattered through Ye Qingtang’s mind and was so painful she broke out into cold sweat.

At the same time, the mammoth troll raised its giant ax and lumbered towards Ye Qingtang and Little White Tiger.

Meanwhile, the little Heavenly Demon was still staring in fascination at the black flames but they weakened as Ye Qingtang was distracted.

The little Heavenly Demon stared in shock as the flame it had painstakingly captured in its hands vanished. At this moment, the shadow of the ax fell on them.

Those demonic eyes of it suddenly turned angry as the little Heavenly Demon raised its head and let out a roar through a mouth lined with sharp, pointed teeth.

The roar seemed to have a great effect on the troll and it stepped back a few steps, his ax frozen in midair.

As for the fish-like monster, it seemed to have been affected by an unknown force as well. It suddenly stopped in the middle of its attack even as its icy blue eyes continued swirling about, as though looking for something.

Ye Qingtang could only stare in stunned silence as she saw the situation suddenly reverse in front of her eyes. Her life had just been hanging by a thread.

By her side, Little White Tiger exhaled a sigh of relief.

“Damn, this little brat finally made a move.”

“This... what’s happening?” Ye Qingtang’s eyes were filled with uncertainty as her gaze swept over the two monsters.

“This is the Heavenly Demon’s bewitching melody. Who knew this little brat was going to be useful in a pinch?” Little White Tiger said.

The bewitching melody was one of the Heavenly Demon’s powers and had an extremely strong enchantment. Even supreme-divine-level monsters would become confused after hearing the bewitching melody and stop all they were doing. But this would only last a short while in supreme-divine-level monsters.

But even though these monsters were extremely strong, they were nothing compared to supreme-divine-level monsters.

Otherwise with the little Heavenly Demon’s young age, it would only be able to bewitch the supreme-divine-level monster for the time of one breath. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

In the time it took for Little White Tiger to explain this, the fish-like monster suddenly regained its wits and let out a huge roar, as though angry that it had been toyed with.

“This monster is stronger than the troll which is why it recovered faster.” All of Little White Tiger’s hairs stood on their ends as it looked at the fish-like monster looming towards them in rage.

Right at this moment, the little Heavenly Demon opened its mouth again and roared at the monsters again. The monster tearing towards them froze for a moment, before it collapsed onto the ground.

Seeing this, Little White Tiger rushed away with Ye Qingtang and the little Heavenly Demon.

The monster was not weak at all and would be regaining its consciousness soon. They were going to die if they continued staying here.

Seizing the opportunity, Little White Tiger ran even faster as Ye Qingtang hugged the little Heavenly Demon tightly so it would not fall.

At long last they finally escaped after Little White Tiger spent all his strength escaping from the previous predicament. On his back, Ye Qingtang breathed a heavy sigh of relief.
