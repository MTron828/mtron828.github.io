Chapter 1888: Di Jiuyuan (1)

Inside the Crystal Palace, Long Xiao was giving Ye Qingtang a crash course. Outside the Crystal Palace, it was an entirely different scene.

Under the continuous rampage by the people of the Ten Thousand Poison Valley, half the outer walls of the Crystal Palace were already damaged.

Liu Rusu was standing outside the Crystal Palace, coldly surveying the half-crumbled walls. A slight frown was on her face.

“How much longer do you need?”

“Senior Sister... this crystal is very hard, we will need a bit more time to destroy it.” One of the black-clad men spoke up nervously. He broke out in cold sweat under Liu Rusu’s icy stare.

Liu Rusu narrowed her eyes and lifted her chin imperiously. She glared coldly at the black-clad man. “A bunch of useless trash. You can’t even manage such a small task? You are all a disgrace to the Ten Thousand Poison Valley.”

As she spoke, Liu Rusu raised her hand and drew it mildly across the black-clad man’s neck. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

In an instant, the man’s face turned pallid as a purple mark suddenly appeared on his neck. He quickly tried to beg for mercy but found that he was unable to speak. That purple mark was already rapidly spreading outward to the rest of his body.

Before he could even try to utter a cry of despair, the man collapsed stiffly on the ground.

His skin had turned a mottled purple, before turning black. His bruised flesh then started to rot. In the blink of an eye, that person became a maggot-infested corpse, before turning into a pile of blackened bones.

The strong smell of rot permeated the air.

A chill ran down the spines of the other Ten Thousand Poison Valley men as they witnessed the sight.

All the while, Liu Rusu’s face remained impassive. She behaved as if she had just squashed an ant, and not one of her own men.

“I will give you another half an hour. You will all end up like him if the Crystal Palace is not destroyed by then,” Liu Rusu stated coldly.

The other black-clad men broke out in cold sweat as their hearts leaped to their throats. They knew very well that Liu Rusu meant what she said.

As Liu Jiangran observed the malevolent-looking Liu Rusu, he chuckled and shook his head lightly. “Don’t be angry, Senior Sister. Our men already have the Crystal Palace surrounded. It is just a matter of time before we capture Long Xiao and the rest.”

“People who are useless to me don’t deserve to continue living. Junior Brother, you have been in the Ten Thousand Poison Valley for so long, don’t tell me you don’t understand this simple concept?”

Liu Jiangran remained nonchalant in the face of Liu Rusu’s malevolence. He merely glanced at the crumbling Crystal Palace. “Our main goal is to find Di Jiuyuan. Long Xiao and the rest are just a means to our end. But Di Jiuyuan has been missing for so many years. Although we know she was last seen entering the mystic realm, no one can be sure if she is still inside, right?”

Liu Rusu smirked. “If she is, we will definitely be able to find her.”

Liu Jiangran replied, “Of course. I have never met Di Jiuyuan, but I’ve heard that she is very formidable. Many years ago, she already possessed extraordinary talent despite her young age. Most of the elders of the Dragon Emperor Clan were not even her match. Now that she has remained in the mystic realm for so many years, her powers must have grown exponentially. To find Di Jiuyuan, Senior Sister only needs to hold the lives of Long Xiao and the others in our hands.”
