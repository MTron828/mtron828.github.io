Ye Qingtang’s male disguise could be considered very handsome. His eyes appeared to be slightly evil. No other man in the team could be compared to Ye Qingtang. Furthermore, Ouyang Qian was so into her that the rest of them all felt jealous.

“It’s an illusion stone,” Ye Qingtang said and smiled.

Ouyang Qian rolled her eyes and stepped closer towards Ye Qingtang. She smiled charmingly. “Young Sir, are you willing to sell the illusion stone to me…”

Ouyang Qian was cultivating a type of fiend skill. Her cultivation would improve hugely with the help of the illusion stone.

Ye Qingtang stared at Ouyang Qian and said, “What do you want to offer in exchange?”

“Anything you ask… Young Sir…” Ouyang Qian’s face was full of shyness.

“How about… your body.” Ye Qingtang’s lips curled up slightly, forming into a devilish smile. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The men in the team were all shocked after hearing her words.

Ouyang Qian also did not expect Young Sir to be so straightforward.

“Hehe… You’re really amusing. Young Sir… How about we discuss again later.” Ouyang Qian’s eyes were filled with coldness.

“Okay.” Ye Qingtang nodded her head in agreement.

“Who do you think you are?! How dare you to be so rude to Lady Ou? Are you tired of living?!”

One of the Yuehua Sect disciples went forward and shouted at Ye Qingtang angrily with his finger pointing at her.

Before Ye Qingtang could say anything, the Blood Moon Elder pointed back at the disciple and rebuked. “Who are you?! How does it bother you when Holy… Young Sir talked to others? Bastard!”

“What did you say?!” The Yuehua Sect disciple’s face immediately clouded.

An extremely ugly servant dared to talk to him like that?!

Feng Cong frowned. He stepped forward and stopped the two people from quarreling. “Can’t you see the situation we are in now? It’s not the time for you to settle your business. Leave it till we can escape from this place alive!”

“This is the Hundred Level Peril mystic realm. If we do not work together, we may all die here. The most urgent thing now is to find people from all the sects and reunite with them. I hope you can set aside your personal matters first,”. another lady from the Falling Sky Valley said.

“Humph!” The Yuehua Sect disciple humphed. He stared at Ye Qingtang in a threatening way and then backed off.

Ye Qingtang did not bother to quarrel with the Yuehua Sect disciple. She followed Feng Cong and the rest to move forward.

From what Feng Cong and the rest described, they also encountered many demon creatures here, and near ten of them died.

The next two days were peaceful as they did not encounter any demon creature. However, they witnessed some broken corpses of sect disciples.

It had been three days since they entered the Hell of Avicinaraka. They needed to spend another thirteen days to leave this place alive. However, it was easier said than done…

A voice was heard at midnight at Ye Qingtang’s temporary place.

“Young Sir Ye.”

Ouyang Qian suddenly appeared with a smile.

She was in a white maxi-dress. Her hair was swinging at her waist area. Half of her breasts could be seen through the dress. Any man would not be able to resist such temptations.

Ye Qingtang was calm after noticing her appearance. “Lady Qian, why do you come over to my place at midnight instead of getting some rest?”
