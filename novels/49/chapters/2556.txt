Absorbing the power of the Heavenly Dao… Ye Qingtang had the same idea previously, but she did not have any feasible solution.

If she could not absorb the power of the Heavenly Dao in the heart, given time, the Heart of the Heavenly Dao would threaten her life. That was the only reason Ye Qingtang might be willing to make a deal with that lady in green.

“Didn’t you say that you didn’t have any way to help me?” Ye Qingtang frowned at the big yellow dog.

If there was really a way, Ye Qingtang was willing to try no matter how dangerous it was.

“After observing you over the past few days, there’s something I have to tell you. Even if you really can absorb the power of the Heavenly Dao, as long as your heart remains in your body, your bad luck won’t disappear. This is like a terrifying curse, unless…” The big yellow dog hesitated.

“Unless what?” Ye Qingtang asked curiously.

“Unless you can disturb the natural laws of the lower realm and follow me to the upper realm. If we go to the upper realm, there will be many solutions to your problem. A mere unlucky heart would be nothing to worry about.” The big yellow dog wagged its tail.

Ye Qingtang, “…”

After going one big round, the big yellow dog just wanted her to grant its wish?

“So do you have a solution or not? If not, cut the crap,” Ye Qingtang said impatiently.

If she really had the ability to disrupt the natural laws, why would she need to waste her breath on this dog? It was not that she did not want to send the big yellow dog home, but she did not have the ability.

“I didn’t have any previously.” The big yellow dog smiled faintly.

“Oh…” Ye Qingtang’s expression changed as if she understood the meaning of the big yellow dog’s words.

“I do have one now, but… it’s very difficult.” The big yellow dog continued. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

In the next second, Ye Qingtang hugged the big yellow dog and smoothed its fur. She smiled and said, “What’s the solution? Tell me about it… if you really help me absorb the power of the Heavenly Dao and I can disrupt the natural laws, won’t I be able to send you home? You haven’t been home for so many years. You must miss home.”

“Ancient God… Karma Tunnel,” the big yellow dog said after a long while.

“Ancient God Karma Tunnel?” Ye Qingtang was baffled. She had never heard of it.

“That’s right. The ancient gods entered into a contract with a descendant of the karma bloodline in the early days. This contract has persisted until today. There must be someone with the karma bloodline in your lower realm. Furthermore, the person with the karma bloodline probably entered the Ancient God Realm to reach that agreement with the ancient gods… that’s how the Ancient God Karma Tunnel was opened.” The big yellow dog nodded.

After the yellow dog finished speaking, Ling Yan’s image suddenly appeared in Ye Qingtang’s mind.

In the so-called lower realm mentioned by the big yellow dog, Ling Yan was the only one who possessed the power of the karma bloodline.

However, Ye Qingtang’s voice transmission stone to communicate with Ling Yan had shattered. She wondered how Ling Yan was doing now.

“This Ancient God Karma Tunnel is an extremely vicious tunnel with all sorts of eternal legacies. You have no way of knowing where it leads to. Enter the tunnel… you could have everything you ever wanted, but you could also lose everything you have. Your soul might even be suppressed under the netherworld and never be able to reincarnate.” The big yellow dog seemed to be in deep thought.

“Have you entered the Ancient God Karma Tunnel before?” Ye Qingtang was curious.
