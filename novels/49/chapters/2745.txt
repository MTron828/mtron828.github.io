Chapter 2746: The Owner Of The Heart Of The Heavenly Dao (1)

“It indeed belongs to my mother.” Ye Qingtang looked at the big yellow dog.

The big yellow dog wagged its tail. “This jade pendant can block your aura.”

Ye Qingtang sized up the jade pendant in her hand.

She was slightly surprised. Just as the yellow dog said, there was indeed strange energy in this jade pendant.

The jade pendant could completely block all auras below the Divine Lord level. In fact, the strange power within the jade pendant was enough to interfere with an entire domain.

In other words, as long as her cultivation level did not go beyond the Divine Lord level and she remained in the Blue Sky Domain, it was enough to shield her, whether she was wearing it or not.

“So the God of Nature could not find me because of this jade pendant...” Ye Qingtang pondered.

From the looks of it, the God of Nature should know everything. He might even know that she was the reincarnation of the Temple of Paragon’s Paragon. Since he could not find her, he bided his time in the Temple of Shadows.

Nevertheless, Ye Qingtang could not figure out what the God of Nature’s motive was. He already had ulterior motives towards her from the moment she was born. He even killed her parents only after she was born...

The God of Nature’s initial goal was to snatch her away and personally train her to become a supreme expert. What benefit would that bring to the God of Nature?!

“Could it be...”

Surprise surfaced in Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

The true owner of the Heart of the Heavenly Dao was the God of Nature?!

“Let’s go!”

Ye Qingtang immediately left the secret lair with the big yellow dog and returned to the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain.

However, when Ye Qingtang entered the star door again, she realized that the constellations had disappeared and so had the God of Nature.

“Little girl, although I don’t know what happened, I have a nagging feeling that it’s not that simple.” After leaving the star door, the big yellow dog seemed to be in deep thought.

“By the way,” the big yellow dog said, “Isn’t there another person who has the Karma bloodline in the lower realm? Find him and see if there are any clues.”

The big yellow dog was referring to Ling Yan.

But Ye Qingtang would have already found Ling Yan if she could.

Ever since returning to this era, Ling Yan seemed to have vanished into thin air. He never appeared again and there was no news of him. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“I can’t find him.” Ye Qingtang shook her head.

“How troublesome. It’s a pity that I’ve been asleep for too long and don’t know what happened. Also... the upper realm was destroyed, and all the power of the Heavenly Dao was snatched away. The current Tian has no emotions and is only responsible for the rules of the world. He won’t interfere either...” the yellow dog mumbled.

“I... want to be Tian.”

Ye Qingtang’s gaze landed on the big yellow dog as she spoke those astonishing words.

“Didn’t you say that the current Tian’s term is coming to an end... Would I have a chance to be the next Tian...” Ye Qingtang said.

“You?” The big yellow dog glanced at Ye Qingtang. “Although you have a lot of Heavenly Dao energy in your body, it is not enough to become Tian. Even if you drain all the Heavenly Dao energy in your heart, it will not be enough. You don’t stand a chance.”

Ye Qingtang, “...”

She wanted those people who had passed away to return... but she could not become Tian...

“Of course, you will become qualified to become the next Tian if you manage to gather enough Heavenly Dao energy...” the yellow dog added.
