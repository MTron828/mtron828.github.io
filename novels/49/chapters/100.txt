Chapter 101: Sect Assessment (3)

Lu Xiuwen’s target was not just to enter the Xuanling Sect but also to be the top person. As such, he would catch the Elders’ attention. He would not allow anyone to mess up his plan.

Within the sect, the four Elders also focused on Ye Qingtang. She performed too well on the Path to Heaven, and she definitely caught their attention.

Especially, Elder Qin of the Array Faction stared closely without blinking once.

Ye Qingtang walked towards the spirit stone under everyone’s gaze. She slowly raised her hand and tried to adjust her spirit root. Continuous strands of aura slowly diffused into the Spirit Stone through her palm.

The ivory stone then started changing color.

Instantly, the stone was covered by red color. Just that there was a glimpse of orange in that red color.

When the color stabilized…

The whole place was silent.

“This is…” The middle-aged man who had great hope was also stunned. Based on Ye Qingtang’s behaviors on the Path to Heaven just now, he was expecting at least a yellow or green spirit root, maybe even better.

He could not imagine that Ye Qingtang would possess the most inferior red spirit root!

Anyone could have a red spirit root. It could be found everywhere.

Even though her spirit root also showed a slight orange color, but it was not up to the level of an orange spirit root. It was still regarded as a red spirit root.

Everyone was astonished at that moment.

No one expected that Ye Qingtang possessed such a low-quality spirit root. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Lu Xiuwen, who was holding his breath, felt relieved. The concern in his eyes was immediately replaced with sarcasm when he saw the red color.

He thought that Ye Qingtang possessed superior spirit root and that was why she dared to challenge him previously. However, he did not think … that it was just a red spirit root.

Yun Shu was also stunned slightly, as he did not expect the outcome.

The four Elders in the sect showed different expressions when they saw the red color. The Elders of the Herbal Faction and Fist Faction did not bother so much, but Elder Lin of the Sword Faction showed despise on his face. He tilted his head and looked towards Elder Qin who was taken aback.

“Elder Qin, I think this time you got the wrong person.”

Elder Qin felt a bit embarrassed as he did not expect such an outcome. Among the four factions, his Array Faction had the lowest requirements towards spirit root. However… a red spirit root was still way below the requirement.

“Mu Su had never recommended anyone to the Xuanling Sect. I thought that she would be a genius since he broke his rules. Who knew… Such a joke.” Elder Lin sneered.

Red spirit roots were never seen in the sect. Even the outer sect disciples started with orange spirit roots. No one with a red spirit root had ever entered the sect.

Elder Qin was made speechless by Elder Lin’s words. He frowned and remained silent.

Elder Lin chuckled and looked back into the mirror.

“This year only Yun Shu and Lu Xiuwen are not bad. The rest do not deserve our attention.”

The two Elders of the Fist Faction and Herbal Faction both agreed. Only people with green spirit roots would have hope to enter the inner sect.

Even though both inner and outer sects were under the Xuanling Sect, the differences between the two sects were unimaginable.

Disciples who could not enter the inner sect would not even have a chance to meet the Elders.

Everyone looked down on Ye Qingtang’s red spirit root, and her outstanding behavior from the Path to Heaven also faded.
