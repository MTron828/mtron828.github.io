Chapter 2320: President (2)

Ran Mo averted his gaze sheepishly.

“I didn’t. I have been practicing very diligently.” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Why don’t I believe you?” Wu Fengling raised his brows.

Ran Mo didn’t dare to respond.

Meanwhile, Wu Fengling turned to look at Qin Feng with an admiring glint in his eyes.

“You are Qin Feng?”

“Yes.”

“Not bad. The younger generation is indeed formidable. Your cultivation level is below that of Ran Mo so why did you choose to challenge him? With your powers, even if you didn’t challenge him, you would still be able to secure a spot in the Inter-Academy Competition,” Wu Fengling asked as he released the restraint he had cast on the two.

Qin Feng recovered his freedom to move and looked steadily at Wu Fengling.

“I want to become number one,” Qin Feng replied.

Wu Fengling was taken aback. “You have great ambition. You want to fight for the number one spot?”

“Yes,” Qin Feng replied without hesitation.

“Why? To prove your power?” Wu Fengling looked at Qin Feng. He admired Qin Feng’s skills but was somewhat displeased with his grandiose ideas.

A martial arts practitioner immersed in the practice of his art had to be humble and willing to learn. It was not a good thing to focus too much on accolades and status.

Qin Feng remained silent. He hesitated before speaking again.

“No.”

“Oh? Then why?” Wu Fengling asked.

Qin Feng straightened his back, looking straight at Wu Fengling with unwavering eyes.

“I want everyone to know that my teacher is the world’s best teacher.”

Wu Fengling was taken aback by Qin Feng’s words.

Ye Qingtang was also stunned.

This brat…

Wu Fengling suddenly laughed.

“The world’s best teacher?”

“Yes,” Qin Feng replied.

“Better than me? If I am willing to take you in as my disciple, will you accept?” Wu Fengling asked with a smile.

Everyone was astonished by Wu Fengling’s question. After all, Wu Fengling was famous for being very picky in his selection of disciples.

Over the past several hundreds of years, the number of disciples under him could be counted on one hand. And every single one of them was now elite practitioners on the mainland.

Only someone with extraordinary talent like Ran Mo would catch the eye of Wu Fengling. Even with Qin Feng’s high innate talent when he first joined the academy, Wu Fengling did not take him on as a disciple.

Everyone knew that it was a great honor to become a direct disciple under Wu Fengling. Not to mention that Wu Fengling was also very powerful and his connections across the mainland were Irrefutably impressive.

In fact, even the Temple of Paragon had disciples who had been under Wu Fengling. And the Temple of Paragon was widely recognized as a top power. They were a terrifying force that could destroy any of the other powers!

In everyone’s opinion, as good as Ye Qing’s teaching abilities were, he would still pale in comparison to Wu Fengling. Only a fool would reject Wu Fengling’s offer.

This was an opportunity that countless others could only dream of.

Just as everyone believed that Qin Feng had just had a major stroke of luck, he shook his head resolutely.

“My teacher is better than anyone else. Even you.”

The crowd gasped.

Was this Qin Feng a fool?

If he could cozy up to Wu Fengling, it would no longer be a problem for him to revive the Qin family.

To think that he was rejecting him, just like that?

“Are you rejecting me?” Wu Fengling looked surprised.

Still, Qin Feng maintained his decision.

“Are you not worried that I will kick you out of the Netherworld Academy?” Wu Fengling asked.

Qin Feng replied, “A teacher is like a father. In this lifetime, I will only acknowledge Ye Qing as my teacher.”

Wu Fengling suddenly laughed.

“A commendable young man.”

He then turned to look at Ye Qingtang.

“You must be Ye Qing?”
