Chapter 431: Grant A Move (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Five moves is still petty? Isn’t this Xuanling Sect disciple too…”

“If five moves still aren’t enough, then should he grant her ten moves?”

The Qinglin Sect disciples sneered.

“Fine by me. Since Junior Sister Ye puts it this way, I’ll grant you ten moves,” Fu Lingtian said with a smile.

“Grant ten moves?!”

“Senior Brother Fu… this is a little unsuitable…”

“What if… he has a slip-up…” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The Qinglin Sect disciples could not help but worry as, after all, ten moves were too much.

“Senior Brother Fu, ten moves is still too little.” Ye Qingtang shook her head once again.

Then, Fu Lingtian frowned slightly and said, “So what is your opinion, Junior Sister Ye?”

“How do twenty moves sound?” Ye Qingtang flashed a faint smile.

“Twenty moves…” Fu Lingtian was stunned.

After Ye Qingtang spoke, there was an uproar below the ring.

“What a joke. How shameless is this Xuanling Sect disciple?!”

“Grant twenty moves? How about giving you all the first place instead?”

“One cannot be too greedy. Senior Brother Fu already granted ten moves, but she was not content!”

Even the Xuanling Sect disciples were embarrassed beyond words because of what Ye Qingtang said. Facing the unfriendly stares of the other two sects’ disciples, they wished they could find a hole in the ground to hide in.

Who would have thought that Ye Qingtang was this shameless and could even say such a thing as to granting twenty moves?

“Haha. Elder Mo, this is a little overboard.” A Qinglin Sect elder looked at Elder Mo in dissatisfaction.

Awkwardness spread on Elder Qin’s face. If he knew Ye Qingtang would be like this, he would not have agreed to let her enter the ring just now.

On the other hand, Elder Mo frowned tightly and did not say anything.

“Haha! Ye Qingtang is only joking with Fu Lingtian. There’s no need to take it seriously.” Elder Qin laughed.

“Joking?”

Everyone stared at each other. Judging from the expression of Xuanling Sect’s Ye Qingtang, she did not seem to be joking.

“Since it is a joke, then I will grant Junior Sister Ye ten moves as I said earlier.” Fu Lingtian’s expression turned a little better.

“It was not a joke,” Ye Qingtang said simply.

At that moment, all the disciples stared at Ye Qingtang once again, and the disciples from Qinglin Sect and Wind Moon Sect glared in disdain and disgust.

“We are already in last place. Haha… Ye Qingtang still did not think that was enough. Now… Xuanling Sect’s reputation is all thrown away because of her!”

“Why was Ye Qingtang allowed to come to the venue of the Three Sect Competition… Ah…”

The Xuanling Sect disciples felt terribly ashamed. Elder Qin had already provided an opportunity for her to extricate her from an awkward position by saying that she was joking, but who could expect Ye Qingtang was this shameless!

“Junior Sister Ye, you’re rather greedy. You want me to grant you twenty moves. How about I remain at a spot for you to attack me, and I don’t strike back?” Fu Lingtian scoffed.

“So you mean that it’s not possible?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“What do you think?” Fu Lingtian looked at Ye Qingtang.

At that, Ye Qingtang shook her head and let out a sigh. “As the defending champion, you are, however, unwilling to grant me twenty moves.”

“Since Junior Sister Ye says it so simply, how about you grant me twenty moves?” Fu Lingtian snickered coldly.

“Grant you twenty moves?” Ye Qingtang pondered and subsequently nodded. “Since you said it, I will grant you twenty moves.”

“What did you say?!” Fu Lingtian was startled and even thought he heard wrong.

“As you wish.”

Under everyone’s gaze, Ye Qingtang placed her hands behind her and looked at Fu Lingtian with an indifferent expression. “I’ll grant you twenty moves.”

The Qinglin Sect and Wind Moon Sect elders had extremely bizarre expressions as they exchanged looks.
