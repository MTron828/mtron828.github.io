Chapter 836 Despair

The last remaining Peerless School disciple looked at the elderly in a Daoist robe and was extremely aghast.

One of the two Peerless School disciples he slaughtered just now had already reached a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord and was extremely likely to enter Peerless School’s inner sect. Thus, there was no doubt about his martial skills...

However, that Peerless School who possessed the skills of a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord was not able to counterattack nor even see clearly how and when the elderly attacked. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Yet, when he returned to his senses, two skulls had already left their bodies and were shot to the sky!

Even if one was an early-stage Yin Yang Perfected Lord, he would definitely be unable to achieve that!

When the last Peerless School disciple personally witnessed his two senior brothers being slain by the elderly in a Daoist robe, his feet turned cold, and it was as though his entire body was enveloped by an invisible fear.

“Senior... Spare my life, Senior!”

As he saw the elderly in a Daoist robe walk towards him, all color was drained from that disciple’s face. His body was already drenched in cold sweat and weakened. He knelt before the elderly in a Daoist robe immediately and pleaded bitterly with a trembling voice.

The last Peerless School disciple was not foolish. This person killed his two senior brothers instantly, and one of them was even a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord.

Evidently, the skills of the elderly in a Daoist robe were already extremely scary, and he definitely not someone he could fight against.

Even if he tried to escape, there was probably no way out.

Currently, if that Peerless School disciple wanted to live, he had no choice other than begging that elderly in a Daoist robe to spare his life.

That elderly in a Daoist robe walked to the Peerless School disciple swiftly, and there was slight sympathy in his eyes when he saw the Peerless School disciple kowtowing non-stop while begging for forgiveness.

“Senior, forgive me please!” Facing a death threat, that Peerless School disciple wept bitter tears with extreme fear imminent in his voice.

“Senior, I failed to recognize your honor and glory and offended you. I know my mistake, I really do! I beg you, senior. I am only fifteen years old this year. I was insensible and stupid. I beg you, senior. Please let me off...”

“Ah.”

The elderly in a Daoist robe shook his head as he watched the Peerless School disciple begging piteously and let out a helpless sigh. “Why are people like this? Only after causing huge trouble would one know that they were wrong and would they admit their mistake.”

“Senior... Senior, I was wrong. I’m still young and insensible... Please spare my life, senior...” The last Peerless School disciple’s body trembled continuously as fear consumed him.

“Look up.”

The elderly in a Daoist robe spoke.

After hearing that, the youth raised his head up slowly. His reddened eyes were filled with fear as he looked at the elderly uneasily. Currently, all his imposing manner was already gone from his face, leaving behind only fear and despair.

“You asked me to forgive you. If my skills were worse than you all earlier on, wouldn’t I have been killed by you all?” The elderly in a Daoist robe told the Peerless School disciple.

“Senior, I really know that I’m wrong... I know I’m wrong... I am only fifteen. I’m insensible...”
