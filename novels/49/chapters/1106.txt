Chapter 1107 Forbidden Formation (3)

“So what. How many Yin Yang Perfected Lords does this mainland have when compared to the Ancient You Clan? They are on a completely different level. They will crush you just based on numbers.” Yin Yang Child was still unconvinced.

Ye Qingtang did not refute this point. Although Yin Yang Child was annoying, what he said was true. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The Ancient You Clan’s roots and culture went back at least ten thousand years. How could this mainland compare to them…

When he saw that Ye Qingtang did not speak further, Yin Yang Child was rather unused to no one arguing with him. In the end, he frowned and said, “I’m just saying that… perhaps there really is a solution. You don’t need to be despondent.”

“Yin Yang Child, you really have an irritating mouth.” The man in black armor glared at Yin Yang Child and smiled coldly.

Without his father’s powerful reputation, Yin Yang Child would probably have been beaten to death already for his irritating mouth.

“He’s right though,” Ye Qingtang said as she glanced at Yin Yang Child.

Ye Qingtang never deceived herself and others. This mainland was not sufficiently united, and it was unrealistic to expect it to unite against the Ancient You Clan’s invasion.

Now, it was impossible for Ye Qingtang to single-handedly withstand the invasion of the Ancient You Clan. However, if people on this mainland could unite together, there might still be a sliver of hope.

“Why haven’t you left this mainland?”

Ye Qingtang suddenly asked Absolute Monarch of Heaven and the others.

She thought that the powerful cultivators from Central Mainland would leave after obtaining the treasure from the Divine Phoenix’s inheritance. However, they unexpectedly remained in this mainland.

She did not understand why they were still here.

“Hmph, do you think we don’t want to leave?” The moment Yin Yang Child recalled the matter, the corners of his mouth twitched, and he snorted coldly.

“We don’t know which wretch performed the Forbidden Formation on this mainland. There is temporarily no way out.”

This mainland was under the Forbidden Formation?

A trace of shock surfaced in Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

For some reason, she suddenly thought of Ling Yan, whom she had not seen for some time.

“In that case, why don’t you stay and protect this mainland?” After a moment, Ye Qingtang laughed softly and asked.

“Impossible.” Yin Yang Child immediately shook his head. “This is beyond our abilities. We have no wish to provoke the Ancient You Clan.”

Ye Qingtang looked at Yin Yang Child and immediately nodded. She seriously and helplessly said, “In that case, I shall not force you… However, the Ancient You Clan is about to kill every living thing on this mainland. Since you can’t leave now, when the time comes, the Ancient You Clan will exterminate you together with this mainland. Don’t blame anyone then.”

The previously fearless and disdainful Yin Yang Child’s face immediately darkened at Ye Qingtang’s words.

How could he have overlooked this!!

“Haha…” The black-robed old man, who had obtained longevity from the Divine Phoenix, laughed. “What Miss Ye says makes sense. Ten thousand years ago, this mainland was created from the Spiritual Abode of Ancient You Clan’s most prominent and powerful figure. After the Dimension Wall cracked, the Ancient You Clan naturally came to this mainland to destroy everything and take back the Spiritual Abode. Now that we are situated in this mainland, we will probably be destroyed together with it.”

Based on the Ancient You Clan’s modus operandi, they would destroy everything once they arrived in this mainland. The Ancient You Clan would naturally ignore people like them. Now that they were unable to leave this mainland, they would probably be destroyed along with it if they did not fight back.
