Chapter 1048 Skill (5)

The two of them rushed forward and forced the branch masters to step back with their strong martial aura.

The Grand Elder of Yuehua Sect sneered. “Young people, do you know what respect is?”

“If you apologize to the Yunxiao Sect and leave now, maybe we can spare your lives,” the Grand Elder of Lingyun Sect said. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Grand Elders, you have nothing to do with what’s going on here. Or do you want to be involved as well?”

Ye Qingtang stepped out to face the two Grand Elders.

The two Grand Elders were shocked by the young lady’s words.

“This young lady seems familiar… Have I seen her somewhere else…” The Grand Elder of Yuehua Sect looked at Ye Qingtang in surprise.

“Is she… the disciple of Xuanling Sect? The one who was so lucky to get the infant Fiendcelestial Beast at the Hundred Level Peril Hell of Avicinaraka…”

The Grand Elder of Lingyun Sect sized up Ye Qingtang, and his eyes were filled with joy.

They had seen drawings of Ye Qingtang before. The young lady in front of them must be the Xuanling Sect disciple Ye Qingtang. And she had an infant Fiendcelestial Beast!

“Hahaha… I did not expect to be so lucky today to be at the Yunxiao Sect!” The Grand Elder of Lingyun Sect laughed. He must get the infant Fiendcelestial Beast today!

“Young one, hand over the infant Fiendcelestial Beast, and I’ll spare your life!” The Grand Elder of Yuehua Sect stared at Ye Qingtang and tried to threaten her.

“Are you even qualified to get the Fiendcelestial Beast?” Ye Qingtang scanned through the two Grand Elders coldly.

The two Grand Elders were enraged upon hearing her words. They did not expect that the young one would be so rude and arrogant that she was not even afraid of her own death.

However, at the next second, their pupils constricted. The aura of a Yang Lord rushed into the sky. It seemed that an ancient Godfiend arrived and surrounded everything in darkness, forcing everyone to kneel down in fear.

The two Grand Elders felt that their bodies were about to be ripped apart by the terrifying aura of a Yang Lord.

They did not even question that they would be killed without any traces left as long as the person in front of them wished to…

“Yang… Yang Lord… How… How is this even possible…”

The Grand Elder of Lingyun Sect’s face was pale as he stared at Ye Qingtang, who appeared to be a giant Godfiend. His body was soaked with cold sweat.

Yang Lord… Only when one reached the Seventh Heaven of Yin Yang Perfected Lord could a person then be called a Yang Lord. However, the person in front of them was at the peak of Seventh Heaven of Yin Yang Perfected Lord. She was just a little step away from entering the Eighth Heaven…

Only at this moment did the Grand Elder of Yuehua Sect understand that the person was not a disciple of Xuanling Sect. He found it weird how a disciple could survive in the Hundred Level Peril Hell of Avicinaraka and get a Fiendcelestial Beast. It was even more unbelievable that she was able to leave the Hell of Avicinaraka with the Fiendcelestial Beast. Everything could be explained if the person was a Yang Lord…
