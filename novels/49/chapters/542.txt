Chapter 543 Exposed Identity (1)

“Your Blood Moon Guardian is Ye Qingtang, a simple Xuanling Sect disciple. More than that, she is from the same clan as me and is only fifteen this year. Your Blood Moon Sect was already annihilated a thousand years ago. From the rumors, weren’t all your Guardians personally appointed by your Holy Lord? Why is it that… now… Could it be that anyone could also be a Guardian of your Blood Moon Sect?” Ye You chuckled and subsequently looked towards Ye Qingtang.

“Qingtang, what exactly is going on? Why did you become a Blood Moon Guardian?”

At that moment, the Grand Elder led the other elders and flew to the sky as they looked at Ye Qingtang in astonishment.

“Is she really a disciple from your sect?” Jiang Chen hollered. “Of course.” The Grand Elder nodded.

..” Ye Qingtang stared blankly at the Grand Elder. Is the brain of this Grand Elder made of tofu?

She risked her life and successfully pretended to be a Blood Moon Guardian with much difficulty, but in the end, it was all foiled by this Grand Elder…

Initially, even if Ye You doubted her, Ye Qingtang still had a way to lie her way through and allow the Blood Moon Sect members to believe her. But now, even Xuanling Sect’s Grand Elder claimed that she was a Xuanling Sect disciple…

“You!”

Jiang Chen turned around and glared at Ye Qingtang furiously. “I already thought it was extremely strange previously. The three Guardians of my Blood Moon Sect never appeared before anyone. Why would it come to our division for no reason!”

“Ha… So it is a fake one… Blood Moon Sect truly made a big joke out of itself.” Ye You lifted her chin as she sneered. “This girl is extremely crafty and has a vicious nature. As a Xuanling Sect disciple, she pretended to be a Guardian of your sect as she wished to borrow your forces to attack my Yunxiao Sect and save Xuanling Sect from its miserable situation.”

After hearing Ye You, the Grand Elder’s expression turned weird. He originally wanted to continue saying something but suddenly changed his stance. “Oh… I saw wrongly… You are not my sect disciple Ye Qingtang. You just resemble her a little.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Mhm… She indeed is not my disciple Ye Qingtang. She does look rather similar, but upon closer inspection, one can tell that they clearly are two different people.” Elder Mo echoed.

“I already said that she is not Ye Qingtang… You all still didn’t believe me. It is time you all finally believe me now.” Elder Mo added.

Ye You glimpsed at the Yunxiao Sect masses. “By changing your stance now, could it be that you all think Blood Moon Sect would still believe you all?”

Subsequently, Ye You looked at the Blood Moon Division Head and smiled. “Blood Moon Sect has a legendary

reputation. Don’t be cheated by this devious girl. It would really become a big joke when both your sect and my Yunxiao Sect suffer an internecine outcome then.”

Ye You could tell from a long time ago that the Blood Moon Sect attacked Yunxiao Sect today and protected Xuanling Sect because of the orders of the “fake Guardian,” Ye Qingtang.

Now, Ye Qingtang’s identity was already exposed. Then… Clank!

Shuo Tianzang immediately sheathed his sword with a calm expression and no longer fought with Li Chenfeng.

“I thought there was something off about you from the start…” Blood Demon looked at Ye Qingtang.

“Scoundrel!” Jiang Chen hollered in fury. How dare this girl pretend to be a Blood Moon Guardian and incite them to come here and start a war with Yunxiao Sect!

“Fellow Blood Moon Sect members, this person is Ye Qingtang, a Xuanling Sect disciple. She killed and injured dozens of my Yunxiao Sect disciples, and she is currently wanted by our sect.” Li Chenfeng withdrew himself from the battle and retrieved an arrest warrant with Ye Qingtang’s face on it from a Yunxiao Sect disciple. Waving it around, he showed it to the Blood Moon Sect members.
