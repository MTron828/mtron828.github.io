“Such a terrifying strength of the body… Normal people would definitely be crushed into pieces under such force…” Ye Qingtang stared at the man with silver hair in the hole.

Ye Qingtang was very sure that the guy had passed away.

Though she was still curious, she did not want to be involved in the trouble and decided to leave.

However, when she was about to turn away, her sight landed on the red space ring on the man’s finger.

Ye Qingtang jumped into the hole immediately and walked towards the man.

“Since you have passed away, the things inside the space ring will be useless for you… How about I keep them for you… I will definitely bury your body nicely in return,” Ye Qingtang smiled and said. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Hmm, you did not object. Then can I assume that you agreed? Thank you so much.” Ye Qingtang murmured to herself. She then squatted down and was about to take away his space ring.

However…

Pow!

The man who had no breath or movement at all suddenly held Ye Qingtang’s hand.

Ye Qingtang used all her strength trying to escape.

However, to her surprise, the man’s palm was like a huge mountain that restrained her. No matter how she struggled, she could not pull her hand away.

“You are not dead? Then it’s a misunderstanding… I thought that you had passed away so… If I offended you in any way, please understand…” Ye Qingtang explained immediately.

Ye Qingtang then looked at the man again.

The man’s eyes were closed, but there was a breath coming out of his body.

“He is… still in a coma?”

Ye Qingtang sighed as she thought that the man was awake and angry with her action.

Ye Qingtang then realized that she worried too much. The handsome man with silver hair did not seem to revive.

Ye Qingtang sized up the man as he was still in a coma.

“The person did not die under such force that could crush a hole on the ground. He did not even have any injuries on his body…” Ye Qingtang was astonished. The man’s strength was too strong to imagine!

Ye Qingtang did not intend to take his space ring anymore since the man did not die.

Ye Qingtang liked to take things from her enemies as she won them over. However, she would never target anything from a stranger even if they were extremely rare and precious. She would never take anything that did not belong to her!

Just now, Ye Qingtang thought that the guy had passed away and guessed that there were treasures inside her space ring. She did not want the treasures to be wasted, and that was why she had the intention to take them over.

“Ah…”

Ye Qingtang could only sigh as she could not escape from the man’s grip, though he was still in a coma.

Ye Qingtang dragged the man out of the hole.

Suddenly, the hand that was holding Ye Qingtang released her.

Ye Qingtang took a few steps back after her hand was freed.

“We are just strangers… So, I shall leave now.” Ye Qingtang turned and decided to walk away.
