Chapter 1757: Demon Cave (1)

The demons mostly looked extremely grotesque. To them, their looks didn’t matter since they respected the strong, but for some reason, one of their hobbies entailed wearing human skin.

It was said that the demons derived joy from skinning humans whole and then wearing their skins.

The bodies of the demons resembled humans in the first place, it was just that they were slightly larger. Once they put on the human skins, all they needed was slight disguise and they would be able to walk among humans undetected. If they swallowed a person’s brain, they would inherit all their memories as well.

In olden times when the demons ran rampant, they would often devour humans, put on their skins and mingle among other humans. They would wait for opportunities to attack other people, taking joy in the fear on their faces as they realized that the person was already dead.

With the strength of the demons, they could slaughter cities just by lifting one finger. But they delighted in inciting fear and anxiety of the lowly humans.

In the eastern cave, Ye Qingtang saw many demons in human skins. They were male and female, young and old, and some even looked familiar to her.

She had seen the faces of these legendary men in her previous life when she had entered the Second Domain.

These powerful men had later disappeared and people had assumed that they had simply gone into hiding. But now that she thought of it, they must have wandered into this cursed mystic realm like all those from the Second Domain before them, and ended up becoming the playthings of these fiendish demons.

In the end, death was not the worst that a person could face. What was worse was not being able to die even when they wanted to.

Ye Qingtang felt her heart sink as she thought of Qiu Ci who had been dragged off earlier. Her eyes swept around but she didn’t see anyone in Qiu Chen or Qiu Ci’s skin. Perhaps the demons that had taken them were from another camp.

But Ye Qingtang had no energy to worry about anyone else right now. She was stuck right in the middle of the demons’ camp, where their numbers far exceeded what she had seen in the valley.

If her identity was revealed here...

Her skin would be peeled off in an instant. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Ye Qingtang’s heart sped up as she thought of this. Even though her expression remained neutral she kept a constant eye on the demons around her, for fear that her identity would be revealed.

But the fiendish demons around her had no interest in her at all and were only focused on the demon who had brought her back. A few of them merely swiped at her and some of them were interested in her “human skin”.

The skins of the two-legged lambs were very popular among the demons. Especially in this valley where humans rarely appeared.

“Hey, so how is it? Let me try on the skin?” The demon beside her was extremely persistent and lifted its hand to push Ye Qingtang. She almost spat out blood with that slap.

Only god knew how strong these demons were.

Ye Qingtang swallowed the blood in her throat. She was lucky that they thought she was in a human skin as blood and the demons just thought that her skin was soaked in blood and didn’t take much notice of it.
