Chapter 2300: Selection Trials (3)

Meng Yao saw that those Leiting family youths were keeping silent but she had no intention of letting things go. She pretended to blow on her fingernails nonchalantly.

Taking the hint, one of the teenagers beside her asked, “Senior Sister, how do you know that Lei Yan won’t be able to stay on any longer?”

It was obvious Meng Yao had been waiting for that question, and she purposely raised her voice. “Don’t you know? Three days ago, Lei Yan’s teacher claimed right in front of the Vice-President that all his students would be selected for the Inter-Academy Competition. Otherwise, he would allow himself to be kicked out of the academy, along with all of his students.”

Meng Yao’s voice was loud and the Netherworld Academy students were all Paragon level and above. They heard every single word.

The surrounding students were all stunned by Meng Yao’s words.

“All his students would be selected? Damn, what kind of teacher would make such an arrogant claim?” One of the students asked in a bewildered tone.

“Lei Yan’s teacher… I heard that he’s a young teacher who just joined the academy. And he only has six students under him.”

“Six? And he dares to make such a bold claim. But… since he dares to do so, his students must be very talented? And he himself must also be very powerful?”

Six students were not considered a lot but claiming that every single one of them would be selected for the Inter-Academy Competition, this level of boldness was astonishing.

Many people in the academy did not know about Ye Qing’s situation. Hearing his bold claim for the first time, a good number of students started discussing it fervently.

Meng Yao couldn’t help sniggering at those words.

“Very talented? Let me see… which students are under him…”

Meng Yao swiveled her eyes and raised one hand, counting off her fingers.

“Lei Yan? Oh right… the useless young master of the Leiting family. Apart from acting cocky, his powers have not improved at all since he enrolled in the academy.”

The crowd was stunned at the mention of Lei Yan’s name.

Very talented? ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

There was no way those words applied to Lei Yan.

“Jing Ze? A poor kid from a common family. He is more or less one of the dregs of our academy…”

The crowd: “…”

“Mu Ziying… mmm? That weird little freak?”

“Or do you mean Nangong Lie, that lazy and frivolous good-for-nothing? Or Yun Chen, who gave up halfway and had to be transferred to the medicine faculty…”

Meng Yao listed out the names and the curious teenagers looked increasingly shocked with each name. In the end, complete disbelief was written all over their faces.

This ragtag bunch? Very talented? What a joke!

This group was the disgrace of the Netherworld Academy!

“Oh, I nearly forgot. There is a truly talented teenager under that teacher. But he is a fallen genius… I think his name is Qin Feng?” After listing out all the names, Meng Yao closed her hand into a fist. She held a grudge against Ye Qing and her own Teacher Di Nuo also hated him. It was only natural that Meng Yao would never give up any chance to humiliate Ye Qing in public.

As expected, everyone was dumbstruck by Meng Yao’s words.

These bunch of losers wanted to enter the Inter-Academy Competition?

What kind of joke was this?

Even if they were given an Emperor level teacher, one couldn’t possibly cook up a grand meal without any ingredients!
