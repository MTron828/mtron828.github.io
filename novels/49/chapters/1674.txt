Chapter 1675: A Tooth For A Tooth (1)

The blood was fresh. Judging from the color, it was likely she had stained her sleeve not too long ago. It was still bright red and wet.

Mu Ruxue noticed what Ye Qingtang was looking at, and raised her hand to examine her sleeve. A trace of a smile suddenly appeared on her lips.

“Ah, I’m so careless. I’ve dirtied my clothes.” Mu Ruxue raised her head and looked at Ye Qingtang. “Jiang Yiran has already laid down his life to beg me to have mercy on you in the arena. Clearly he knows you are no match for me. I thought you would not dare to enter the arena since you asked him to plead with me. I didn’t expect you... to be so pathetically stupid. Surely you don’t think... I’ll let you off just because Jiang Yiran came to apologize to me?”

Mu Ruxue’s words took Ye Qingtang by surprise. Jiang Yiran had apologized to Mu Ruxue?

What was going on?

“What do you mean?” Ye Qingtang asked calmly.

Mu Ruxue chuckled and looked at Ye Qingtang mockingly. “What’s the matter? You’re shameless enough to get Jiang Yiran to plead with me, but not shameless enough to admit it? But... what a pity all you Jiangs are equally stupid. He thought I would let you off if he knelt and allowed me to hack at him as I pleased? Ah... I haven’t settled the score with him for embarrassing me that day. I almost killed him just now, and I’ll consider that payment for his debts. But as for you... I certainly won’t let you off.”

“What have you done to Jiang Yiran?” Ye Qingtang’s eyes were narrowed and her voice had become extremely soft.

“What’s the matter?” Mu Ruxue suddenly laughed loudly. She peeked at the corner of the central square. “Can’t you see for yourself?”

Ye Qingtang followed Mu Ruxue’s gaze and saw a grim-looking Jiang Yanyun carrying a blood-covered figure, rushing away from the crowd.

It was only a glance, but Ye Qingtang’s heart felt as though it had turned into ice.

“That idiot...” Ye Qingtang drew a deep breath. She had not expected Jiang Yiran to do such a thing.

How could he do that just to ensure that Mu Ruxue did not try to kill her?

Damn him... why was he so stupid... so stupid that... her heart ached.

“Don’t worry. I didn’t kill him. I’ve always been compassionate.” Mu Ruxue raised her hand slightly, as if she had shown the utmost grace in not killing Jiang Yiran.

“But I won’t be so nice to you.” Mu Ruxue’s eyes grew cold.

Ye Qingtang eyes were lowered. But now she raised them and looked at Mu Ruxue again. Her previously-calm expression had turned frosty.

“Mu Ruxue, I’ll say the same to you.”

Jiang Yiran, I will avenge you!

The unexpected response stunned Mu Ruxue. She sensed that Ye Qingtang’s manner had undergone an obvious transformation.

“You overestimate yourself. I would like to see how terribly you die in my hands.” Mu Ruxue suddenly drew her sword and tilted her chin towards Ye Qingtang.

Jiang Yisheng, who was outside the arena, was frantic. He crouched by the side of the arena, wishing that he could go over and drag Ye Qingtang down. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Is Qingtang mad? How can she possibly compete with Mu Ruxue? That lunatic is so vicious, she will certainly make things difficult for Qingtang. Shaobai, why won’t you try to dissuade her?”

Jiang Shaobai was standing next to the arena. He looked at the chilly looking young girl standing under the glaring hot sun and did not even bat an eyelid.

“My Elder Sister Qing won’t lose.”

He spoke very slowly. His voice was very soft and his words were almost blown away by the wind.

“She won’t lose? Even Jiang Yiran was no match for Mu Ruxue...” Jiang Yisheng said.

“Didn’t Jiang Yiran also lose to Elder Sister Qing?” Shaobai remarked casually.
