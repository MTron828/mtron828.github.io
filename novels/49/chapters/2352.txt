Chapter 2353: Competition Ended

“Your match with Di Nuo is over? But…” Wu Fengling was astonished. He looked at the completely unharmed Ye Qing.

Could Di Nuo have had a change of heart?

He had gone easy on him?

Ran Mo blinked in confusion. Meanwhile, Hang Wenwei, Gong Jinyun, and Qiu Nan dragged him off to the side.

“What happened? The match between Teacher Ye and Teacher Di Nuo is over?” Ran Mo was befuddled and he stared at the other three in confusion.

Ran Mo suddenly realized that the trio was beaming, as if they had just discovered a great treasure.

“Little Mo Mo, you didn’t see it just now. A real pity. The match between Teacher Ye and Teacher Di Nuo was mind-blowing.” Hang Wenwei draped his arm around Ran Mo’s shoulder, smiling like a cheeky rogue.

Little Mo Mo…?

Ran Mo was speechless but he remained on track.

“Has the match between Teacher Ye and Teacher Di Nuo really ended? Where is Teacher Di Nuo then?”

Hang Wenwei indicated the exit with his chin.

“He was carried out.”

Ran Mo, “…”

Di Nuo was carried out?

Did he hear correctly?

Hang Wenwei watched Ran Mo’s eyes grow wide. He grinned. “Guess what the true cultivation level of our Teacher Ye is?”

Ran Mo asked, “Teacher Ye has been concealing his true powers?”

Hang Wenwei nodded.

Ran Mo looked at the completely unharmed Ye Qing and then at Hang Wenwei and the other two, who were all grinning widely. He then linked it with the fact that Di Nuo was carried away. He made a bold guess. “Could he be at the Divine Lord Third Heaven stage?”

Di Nuo was a Divine Lord Second Heaven stage practitioner. If Teacher Ye could defeat Di Nuo, his level must definitely be higher.

Hang Wenwei shook his head.

“Little Mo Mo, you are still too young. Our Teacher Ye is a true-blue Divine Lord Fifth Heaven level!”

Ran Mo: “!!!”

Hang Wenwei was speaking softly but Wu Fengling was able to hear him. When Wu Fengling heard the words “Divine Lord Fifth Heaven level”, he was shocked and immediately turned to look at Ye Qing in amazement.

“Ye Qing, you are a Divine Lord Fifth Heaven stage practitioner?” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Ye Qing nodded.

Wu Fengling took a deep breath as he looked at Ye Qing with a complicated light in his eyes.

Wu Fengling had already been overjoyed that Ye Qing had won Zhu Ning in elixir-refinement. He didn’t expect there would be another major surprise waiting for him!

A Divine Lord Fifth Heaven level and with alchemy skills above that of a Master-level alchemist… This was really a precious treasure that Wen Qi had brought him!

The situation had far exceeded Wu Fengling’s expectations. It was like every time he saw Ye Qing, he would bring him some great surprise. Thinking of how the Netherworld Academy had been like the past few years, Wu Fengling gazed at Ye Qing in excitement.

Perhaps he had been sent by the heavens to help the Netherworld Academy.

“Ye Qing, you are full of endless surprises.” Wu Fengling gave a happy chuckle.

Ye Qing’s situation was now different from what he initially understood. He would have to make some adjustments to his plans now. Given Ye Qing’s prowess in martial arts and alchemy was out of this world. His reputation would spread like wildfire across the Netherworld Academy.

Zhu Ning had been very insistent about sealing off his tripod, but after being persuaded by both Ye Qing and Wu Fengling, he decided to keep to the agreement between him and Wu Fengling first. The day that Wu Fengling left, he would keep his promise to Ye Qing.

Today, all six of Ye Qing’s students qualified for the Inter-Academy Competition.

Lei Yan said, “Who said that he would eat the whole platform? Hurry up, don’t waste time.”

The guy who made that claim had already shrunk into a corner, desperately wishing that he could disappear.
