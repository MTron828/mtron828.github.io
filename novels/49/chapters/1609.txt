Chapter 1610: Don’t Move If You’re Scared (1)

Of course, the allied forces saw the ten thousand soldiers emerging from the Kingdom Fortress.

The allied forces roared with laughter when they saw their pathetic military strength.

“Ten thousand men? Is the Supreme League Kingdom joking? They’re so few of them that there’s probably not enough for us to sink our teeth into.”

“Ha, guess what I saw? Look at that pathetic little girl. Don’t tell me she’s the general the Supreme League Kingdom sent? The Supreme League Kingdom must really be short of people if they’re sending a little fellow like that out to die.”

A few sharp-eyed knights of the Glorious Lion saw Ye Qingtang astride her tall horse. They burst out laughing when they saw Ye Qingtang’s appearance.

“How old is she? Is she even fourteen years old? She’s probably shorter than the spear I’m holding. How can someone like that lead troops to war?”

“The Supreme League Kingdom isn’t taking us seriously. Brothers, let’s give them a fright.”

The next moment, the five-hundred-thousand-strong troop let out a deafening roar. It was as if the entire earth shook. As they roared, they raised their weapons, which glittered blindingly in the sunshine, and clustered densely together in a line. It was a hair-raising sight.

The ten thousand soldiers from the Supreme League Kingdom were terrified by this sight. They knew they had been sent to die, but they were unable to suppress their terror of death.

Ye Qingtang glanced at the troops behind her, who were quivering with fear. Her face was completely devoid of expression.

“Tang, this is your first time participating in a battle. Don’t embarrass our Supreme League Kingdom.” Joseph yelled maliciously from the fortress wall. He could not wait to see Ye Qingtang wet herself with terror.

Many of the Kingdom Knights laughed at Joseph’s remarks.

But the ten thousand soldiers despaired when they heard that this was Ye Qingtang’s first time participating in a battle.

“They actually sent someone who has never fought in a battle before...”

“We really were sent here to die.”

“And we have to die with her.”

The soldiers, who initially still had some fighting spirit, completely lost their morale when they learned that their leader had not even participated in a battle before.

This proved that they had been sent here to die.

Ye Qingtang ignored the jeers. She turned her head slightly and looked at her despondent soldiers.

“Are you scared?”

The soldiers that were prepared to die had no respect for Ye Qingtang. Anyway, they were doomed. Who cared if she was a Kingdom Knight or not?

“Who wouldn’t be scared? It’s ten thousand against fifty thousand. How can we win? We’ve been sent here to die.”

“Sir Knight, you’re so powerful. Why don’t you advance?”

They all sneered.

Ye Qingtang’s lips slowly curved in a smile. “If you’re scared, just stay here and don’t move.”

The soldiers were bewildered by Ye Qingtang’s words. They wondered if this Knight Tang was crazy.

She will allow us to stay here without moving?

Stay here and wait to be captured and killed?

But before the soldiers could react, Ye Qingtang suddenly spurred her horse forward and charged towards the allied forces by herself.

The soldiers were all astonished.

“Is this Knight Tang an idiot? What is she thinking? Is she in a hurry to die?”

At that moment, all the Supreme League Kingdom soldiers were shocked. When the allied forces saw Ye Qingtang charging at them single-handedly, they were startled, and then burst into uproarious laughter.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
