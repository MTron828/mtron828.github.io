Chapter 756 Finding Troubles on the Door (2)

When the Blue Cloud Peak disciple finished his words, all the Admirable Sky Peak disciples who were present were stunned.

They only knew about the first half of the content he said.

However…

Ye Qingtang beat Li Jingwen?

When did that happen?!

The Admirable Sky Peak disciples were all shocked, but they did not dare to say anything. They could only pay attention to their conversations.

“Ye Chen beat and injured Li Jingwen?” Perfected Xuanchen was slightly shocked. He was aware of Li Jingwen’s ability since he was the chief disciple of Blue Cloud Peak. However, Ye Qingtang had only entered the valley for a few days. How could she injure Li Jingwen?

The Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master sneered. “How could it be fake? Valley Master, your disciple is very cruel. Li Jingwen is still in a coma and has multiple injuries. If you do not believe me, you can check it out yourself.”

Perfected Xuanchen frowned and looked towards Yan Shu. “Yan Shu, is that true?”

Yan Shu’s name was called, and he had to reply. “Yes, but…”

“Valley Master, you disciple confirmed that as well. What else do you have to say?” The Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master did not even give Yan Shu anytime to explain.

Perfected Xuanchen’s face clouded and said towards Yan Shu, “Ask Ye Chen to come here now.”

He then looked at the Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master and said, “Ye Chen is my disciple. If he really injured his Senior Brother, I’ll punish him heavily.”

“I know that you are always fair, Valley Master. I hope you will settle this incident impartially as well,” The Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master said.

“Of course.” Perfected Xuanchen’s face was expressionless.

Everyone then waited for Ye Qingtang’s arrival.

The Admirable Sky Peak disciples all had a complex state of mind.

They thought that Ye Qingtang was a timid person that only knew how to cause trouble. However… she had the nerve to go to the Blue Cloud Peak and beat Li Jingwen.

Though they all knew Perfected Xuanchen’s concern, they all were enraged by Li Jingwen’s behaviors today.

Now, after knowing that Ye Qingtang beat Li Jingwen heavily, everyone felt relieved, especially those who were injured by Li Jingwen.

Soon, Yan Shu led Ye Qingtang over.

Ye Qingtang walked over calmly under everyone’s gaze. When she raised her eyes, she saw the Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master, whose face was clouded, and Perfected Xuanchen, whose face was slightly darkened.

Yan Shu told her that the Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master was here to find trouble with her on their way here. She was clear of the situation now.

“Master.” Ye Qingtang kept her thoughts and bowed to Perfected Xuanchen. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Perfected Xuanchen stared at Ye Qingtang, who had become his disciple for only a while now, and nodded.

“Ye Chen, have you been to the Blue Cloud Peak today?” He asked.

Though Ye Qingtang became his disciple for a while only, he was still his own disciple. He would not stand at the side. If he really made a mistake, he would punish him heavily. However, if the Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master fabricated the truth, he would not allow that to happen.

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang replied without any hesitation.

“Did you fight against Li Jingwen and injure him?” Perfected Xuanchen felt that based on Ye Qingtang’s age, his ability should not be above Li Jingwen’s.

“That’s true.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

Perfected Xuanchen’s sight was more serious now.

The Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master heard that Ye Qingtang confessed and scoffed immediately. “Valley Master, things are clear now. Please settle it fairly and punish Ye Chen to relieve our anger.”
