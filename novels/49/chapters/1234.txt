Chapter 1235: Doubts (3)

The leader of the Goblin Tribe was a slender man. He was extremely handsome but a little effeminate. He secretly studied Ye Qingtang and said softly, “The Holy Lord vanished a long time ago. No one knows why she vanished and where she has been all this time. I heard that those who first met the Holy Lord this time only coincidentally found her along the way. I think its rather peculiar.”

“Could it be that… this Holy Lord is an impostor?” The leader of the Demon Tribe asked.

“We don’t know yet. But Ming Wang must also be suspicious of her identity, which is why he is carrying out this ceremony. We can just wait and see.” The leader of the Goblin Tribe laughed softly. A sharp look suddenly flashed across his eyes.

“If she is fake, she will certainly die,” the leader of the Demon Tribe said with a cold laugh.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang had just stepped into the Dim Hall. She vaguely sensed that something was amiss, and the ominous foreboding in her heart grew stronger.

She tried her best to maintain her composure. Her gaze swept across all the Undead present.

Among the numerous Undead, Ye Qingtang saw a few figures with powerful breaths. They looked extremely peculiar.

Their appearance and breaths clearly showed that they were different from Xue Fu and the Skeleton Tribe she had met earlier.

In her previous life, Ye Qingtang had heard many things about the Undead. Naturally, she also knew that the Clan of the Undead was divided into many tribes. When she saw the breaths and auras of these Undead, she thought that they were probably the various legendary tribe leaders within the Clan of the Undead.

Besides these tribe leaders, Ye Qingtang also saw two little fellows who looked exactly alike. They were standing right in front of her.

Although they were identical, the two children gave off different airs.

Ye Qingtang was stunned.

“Ah Yao…” The moment Ming Gu saw Ye Qingtang, he charmingly reached out to ask for a hug.

But before he could take a step, the expressionless Ming Wang, who was standing next to him, held him back.

Ming Wang raised his eyes slightly. His calm black eyes looked straight at Ye Qingtang. His sharp gaze was clearly searching.

Ye Qingtang kept her face still and met his gaze directly.

Although she was inwardly shocked, how Ming Wang acted towards Ming Gu clearly showed that the former constrained the latter. In the entire Temple of Shadows, there must be only a few who were imposing enough to dare to act like that towards the Holy Son, Ming Gu.

Furthermore…

These children were identical…

Twins were rare in the Clan of the Undead. Even when they appeared, they were certainly mutant Undead.

Rumor had it that the Holy Son of the Temple of Shadows was a rare mutant Undead.

However, when twins were born in the Clan of the Undead, ultimately, only one could survive. Hence, everyone naturally assumed that the other child must have died long ago.

But now…

Ye Qingtang realized that the rumors that had reached the outside world were probably wrong.

The child who looked just like Ming Gu must be Ming Gu’s brother…

However… Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Although they were brothers, the children were like chalk and cheese.

“We greet the Holy Lord.” The tribe leaders now went forward and gave shallow bows to Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang nodded slightly, but she was inwardly on full alert.

Ming Wang, who was standing nearby, spoke coldly.

“Holy Lord, please ascend the tower.”

Ascend the tower?

Ye Qingtang was dumbfounded. She looked around with the corner of her eyes, but she was surrounded by flat ground. Where was the tower?

Ye Qingtang did not make any move. All the Undead present were staring at her.
