Chapter 1776: The Battle Between The Top Three (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“What is that?” Several little fiendish demons beside Ye Qingtang shivered in fear at the sound of the horn.

The two Great Generals also immediately stopped fighting the moment they heard the blaring noise. They appeared apprehensive and looked like they were listening out for something. Hovering in mid-air, they didn’t seem to have any intention of continuing their fight.

“It’s... the call of the Heavenly Demon Tribe...” The eastern Great General’s expression shifted. As powerful as he was, he couldn’t help shuddering at the sound of that horn.

“The Emperor Demon Tribe and the Earth Demon Tribe... they also sounded their signals today...” The western Great General’s face was likewise very grim.

There were over a dozen fiendish demon camps in this valley. The eastern and western camps had their long-running grudge. The other factions also had their own conflicts. As a result, the battles between the various camps never ceased.

But the three top fiendish demon tribes rarely appeared in this part of the mountain valley. They were the Heavenly Demon Tribe, the Emperor Demon Tribe and the Earth Demon Tribe.

It was not that these three major tribes were peace-loving and benevolent. It was because within this valley, any fiendish demon faction who went against any one of the top three had already been instantly decimated.

None of the remaining demon camps would dare to provoke the big three tribes. It was a death wish to go against any one of them.

The two Great Generals exchanged a look and understood what each was thinking. They immediately descended to the ground, back at their own factions.

“We will postpone the settlement of this grudge between you and I. The appearance of all three major tribes at the same time is something out of the ordinary. I am afraid it means... the Deity Ocean will be emerging soon...” The western Great General spoke in a cold voice.

The eastern Great General also didn’t intend to continue fighting.

No grudge was more important than the Deity Ocean.

The two demon camps, which had been fighting so ferociously just a second earlier, immediately dispersed. Led by their respective Great Generals, they headed towards the source of the blaring horns.

Ye Qingtang followed the crowd of fiendish demons, but her heart was full of uncertainty.

“We will get to see something exciting later. The congregation of the three top tribes! When else would we get an opportunity like this?” Ba murmured to himself as he hurried along.

“What do you mean?” Ye Qingtang glanced at Ba.

“What else can I mean? We are nothing to the three big tribes. Have you ever seen any demons from those three in this part of the valley before? The rest of us may be fighting tooth and nail for territory here but the three top tribes don’t care for this place at all. They simply can’t be bothered about us. Why else do you think we can still conduct our battles here? The truly premium territories in the valley have already been fully occupied by the big three.” The corners of Ba’s lips curled up in a sneer. Nevertheless, his words were still full of awe and respect for the three elite demon tribes.

In the eyes of the top three tribes, the rest of the demon factions were just tiny, insignificant squabbling kids. Completely not worth their time or attention.

“The three big demon tribes seldom appear in this part of the valley. Now that all three signals have been sounded, they are summoning all the demons under their camps. Something big must be happening.” Ba narrowed his eyes. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Apart from the Deity Ocean, I really cannot imagine what else can trigger all three tribes at the same time,” Hu spoke up in a low voice from the side.
