Then, Zhou Fu immediately sent his people back to the Zhou family clan to bring the high-ranking powerful figures and a beast tamer master who was staying in the Zhou family clan temporarily.

“Son of a bitch…” Shangguan Rui glared at Ye Qingtang in fury. “You’ll die without a doubt. Everyone in your clan will be completely annihilated because of your ignorance!”

“Kneel down.” Ye Qingtang ordered coldly as she looked at Shangguan Rui.

“What… What did you say?!” Shangguan Rui could not believe what he heard.

“I want you… to kneel down.” Ye Qingtang repeated.

Not mentioning Shangguan Rui, everyone in the surroundings gasped upon hearing what Ye Qingtang said!

This beautiful young man actually wants Shangguan Rui to kneel to her?

Does she even know who Shangguan Rui’s father is?

Is she tired of living?!

“You’re courting death!” Shangguan Rui shouted angrily.

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly and kicked a leg out.

Cluck!

The sound of crushed bones rang.

Ye Qingtang’s kick completely crushed the bones in Shangguan Rui’s knees.

The moment his bones crushed, Shangguan Rui kneeled beside Ye Qingtang’s legs weakly. The pain caused him to break out in a cold sweat profusely, and his face whitened.

“Were you threatening me just now?” The mischievous expression on her face deepened as she watched Shangguan Rui.

Shangguan Rui wanted to kill her earlier on, and from then, Ye Qingtang never planned to let him off alive.

At this instant, Ye Qingtang looked straight ahead of her from the corner of her eyes.

A middle-aged man riding on a horse was rushing towards them at top speed with thousands of military cultivators behind him.

“Look. It’s the Dragon-Tiger General!”

Shouts erupted in the crowd.

Everyone looked ahead immediately.

Indeed, the person on the warhorse was Shangguan Rui’s father, Dragon-Tiger General Shangguan Ze!

“Father… Father!”

Upon noticing his father, Shangguan Rui ignored the pain in his legs and crawled forward with his hands on the ground.

“Rui!”

The Dragon-Tiger General was shocked to see Shangguan Rui crawling towards him and immediately leaped down his horse. Fury and resentment riled in him when he saw how miserable his precious son was with his broken legs.

However, before the Dragon-Tiger General could get any closer, Shangguan Rui was lifted back by Ye Qingtang by the neck.

“How dare you!” The Dragon-Tiger General glared at her furiously. “Let my son go, and I’ll leave your corpse in one piece!”

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

“Kill!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

As the Dragon-Tiger General spoke, the thousands of military cultivators behind him shouted repeatedly.

“Leave my corpse in one piece?” Ye Qingtang’s lips curled into a sinister smile. “General, are you not clear of the situation?”

Shangguan Rui was in her hands right now, and his life and death were all up to Ye Qingtang. Yet, this Dragon-Tiger General still dared to say things like leaving her corpse in one piece at this timing. What a joke.

“Is this fellow crazy?!”

“How dare he say such a thing to the Dragon-Tiger General. Is he relying on just that above-average spirit animal of his to fight against the Dragon-Tiger General?!”

There was a flurry of discussion in the crowd.

“Father, quickly… Kill this little bastard… Must slaughter his entire clan and completely annihilate his clan!” Shangguan Rui shouted loudly.

“Rui, don’t be anxious!” The Dragon-Tiger General frowned deeply and looked at Ye Qingtang. “What do you wish to do?”
