Chapter 2441: Big Yellow Dog (2)

“What the hell are you?” Ye Qingtang was curious.

“I am a canine,” the dog spoke fluently.

Ye Qingtang was speechless. Wasn’t that the same thing as a dog?!

“Dog sounds so insulting. You are so rude, not showing me any respect. I am a canine, not a dog,” the dog continued.

Ye Qingtang did not reply. She could clearly feel that this dog was not a demon. Not only that, she could not detect any power inside this dog. This meant that it was indeed a normal dog. The only difference between the common dog and this one here is that it could talk. Other than that, it posed no threat to her.

Before the dog could say anything else, Ye Qingtang scooped it up from the spring.

It was a big yellow dog and rather good-looking according to human standards. It might not be pretty enough to be a dog model, but it was not bad.

The big yellow dog immediately shook its fur after being scooped up, spraying countless water droplets onto Ye Qingtang’s face. Before Ye Qingtang could speak, the big yellow dog fixed its eyes on her.

“You are a human.”

Ye Qingtang replied, “You are a dog.”

“And I am your father,” the big yellow dog retorted.

Ye Qingtang, “???”

When she came to her senses, she glared at it. She was going to kill it!

The big yellow dog hastily took two steps back when it felt Ye Qingtang’s aggressive aura. “What are you planning to do? Don’t tell me you want to torture a dog?”

“I am feeling a little hungry now.” Ye Qingtang stared at the dog and gave it a slight smile.

“Hungry… there’s nothing to eat here.” The big yellow dog replied instinctively.

Ye Qingtang continued to stare quietly at the big yellow dog with that smile on her face.

As if it suddenly realized something, the big yellow dog hurriedly said, “Stand there and don’t move. I will go find something for you to eat. I will be back soon!”

With that, the big yellow dog turned to flee with its tail between its legs.

But there was no way Ye Qingtang would let that big yellow dog escape so easily. With lightning-fast reflexes, she grabbed its hindleg. “Let’s see how you can run now.”

“You… preposterous! Let go of my leg!” The big yellow dog cried out in panic. “Is there still a god? You look so sweet and lovely but harbor such evil thoughts. You want to eat me!”

“I won’t eat you if you answer my questions honestly.”

“How dare you… Do you know who I am?” The big yellow dog shouted.

“Oh, I am indeed rather interested to know. Please tell me who you are.” Ye Qingtang was curious.

Ye Qingtang had lived two lives but had never seen such a strange thing. A common dog was able to speak. The world was wide and nothing was impossible. Moreover, this talking dog had appeared inside the Wailing Well. Things were probably not as simple as they appeared to be.

“Let me tell you, it doesn’t matter who I am!” The big yellow dog shouted.

Without giving Ye Qingtang a chance to reply, it continued. “I have people above me!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“People above you?” Ye Qingtang was taken aback. She instinctively glanced above the big yellow dog.

“I mean I have people behind me!” The big yellow dog corrected.

“Behind?” Ye Qingtang looked behind the big yellow dog.

The big yellow dog, “…”

“Do you really understand English? I mean that I have powerful people backing me. You cannot afford to offend me.”
