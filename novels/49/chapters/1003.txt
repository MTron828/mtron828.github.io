Chapter 1004 Yang Lord (1)

The senior members and the disciples of the Ye Family, the Duan Family, and even the Long Family all stared at Ye Qingtang in shock. They were all taken aback by the power and froze.

However, no one knew what did the disaster-like aura represented besides the previous Qinglin Sect’s Grand Elder.

The senior members of the Ye Family all trembled in fear under the aura. It seemed that they were going to suffocate to death.

“What… what was that…” The senior members of the Ye Family looked at each other and murmured. Their eyes were filled with astonishment.

“You…”

The previous Qinglin Sect’s Grand Elder’s face was full of terror.

As the previous Qinglin Sect’s Grand Elder and a true Yin Yang Perfected Lord, he obviously knew what this power represented.

“Yin… Yin Yang Perfected Lord… Seventh Heaven… A Yang Lord… This is impossible… You… You’re a Yang Lord…”

The Elder stared at Ye Qingtang in fear. The young lady in front of him was a real Yang Lord!

“Ying Yang Seventh Heaven… Yang Lord?!”

The Long Family Master froze as he heard the Elder’s words. When he looked towards Ye Qingtang again, his sight was filled with surprise and disbelief.

“Yang… Lord…”

The Clan Master Duan and the members of the Duan Family could not believe what they just heard.

Though they had never seen a Seventh Heaven Yin Yang Perfected Lord or felt the aura, they understood what a Yang Lord was.

The Yin Yang Perfected Lord was separated into two different levels. The first level was called a Yin Lord, and the second level was called a Yang Lord.

The Yin Lord and the Yang Lord were of a world difference, but the difference in their power was huge!

The First to Sixth Heavens of the Yin Yang Perfected Lord were Yin Lords. Only when one’s martial ability entered the seventh Heaven could he then step into the second level and become a Yang Lord.

The number of Yang Lords on this mainland was very limited. Any Yang Lord could make the land tremble when they slightly used their power.

Besides the Elder who was at Yin Yang Perfected Lord level as well, no one else who was present was able to understand the meaning of the aura. If the Elder did not speak up, the members of the three families would still think that the aura belonged to the Fiendcelestial Beast.

Now, they finally understood why Ye Qingtang did not bother to talk to the senior members of the Ye Family when they could not stop chattering.

The difference in the levels was so huge that none of them could even enter her eyes. Even the Grand Elder, who was a Yin Yang Perfected Lord, also did not qualify to speak to her…

Duan Tianrao’s face was extremely unpleasant. The fiancée that he looked down at and wanted to annul the engagement with had become an unbeatable powerful person in these two years… The Seventh Heaven of the Yin Yang Perfected Lord…

“Senior, please spare my life!”

Cold sweat appeared on the Grand Elder’s forehead. He kneeled down immediately in terror.

A Yang Lord to him was an unconquerable true god. The young lady in front of him could kill him with just a thought without leaving any trace of his flesh and bones.

Ye Qingtang looked at the previous Qinglin Sect’s Grand Elder coldly. All these people were nothing in her eyes. She did not even have any interest to talk to them.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔
