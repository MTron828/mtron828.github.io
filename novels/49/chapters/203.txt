Chapter 204: Using Official Regulations As Pretext To Seek Revenge (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang saw how Qin Huan ran away so quickly and was at a loss of whether to cry or laugh.

If Zhou Xuan was so easy to persuade, Gu Yanqiu would have gone to settle the matter right when he heard the news.

Ye Qingtang could not stop Qin Huan and could only let him go.

Ye Qingtang more or less knew what Zhou Xuan was thinking of.

There were often deaths when disciples were out on missions. Even if they accidentally lost their lives in a battle, the sect would not investigate too deeply into what happened.

Ye Qingtang returned to the room with that thought. It was rare that Lin Long was also in the room today. Ye Qingtang nodded at Lin Long she saw her and then looked at the silver wolf which was sitting below the window. When the wolf met Ye Qingtang’s eyes, something seemed to flash across its green orbs, and it immediately turned away before Ye Qingtang sensed it.

“Little…” Ye Qingtang always felt that her little baby was too shy. Every time she massaged it, it always fell out with her.

She was about to caress the wolf, but Lin Long, who had always been silent, suddenly called Ye Qingtang.

“Junior Sister Ye.” A rather aloof female voice sounded from behind Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang stopped in her tracks and looked at Lin Long, who suddenly said something.

“Senior Sister Lin? Is there anything?” Ye Qingtang usually did not spend a long time in the dorm, and even if she returned, she was mostly with the silver wolf. Lin Long had an aloof personality, and the two of them did not really interact with each other. The only time they talked was the day when Ye Qingtang just moved into the dorm.

Lin Long had an indifferent look on her face. She stood up from her table and placed a file in Ye Qingtang’s hands.

Ye Qingtang looked at Lin Long a little confusedly. When she took a look at the file, she actually realized that it was the file for a sect mission.

Why did she suddenly pass her this sect mission file?

“Return it back to me before tomorrow.” Lin Long returned to her seat and took up a book to read after leaving Ye Qingtang with such an unclear sentence.

Ye Qingtang was really at a loss and did not know what was Lin Long trying to do, but she still flipped through the file in her hand. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

And this surprised her immediately.

At the last part of the file, there was a line written clearly:

[Participants: Zhou Xuan, Lin Long… Ye Qingtang]

Apart from these three names, there were two other foreign disciples’ names.

Ye Qingtang suddenly looked up. Although she was looking at Lin Long’s cold side-profile, her heart was warm.

Lin Long was also in Zhou Xuan’s sect mission and probably already noticed that something was off; thus, she chose to hand this file to Ye Qingtang.

While Ye Qingtang was not afraid of any difficulties that Zhou Xuan would make, it was inevitable that she would fall for Zhou Xuan’s schemes if she did not familiarize herself with the mission contents before going on the mission. Lin Long’s move indeed resolved Ye Qingtang’s urgent worries.

Ye Qingtang’s grip on the file tightened as she spoke to Lin Long gently. “Thank you, Senior Sister Lin.”

Lin Long looked at Ye Qingtang without emotion and responded with an almost unnoticeable nod. Then, she returned her focus on the book in her hand.

Ye Qingtang immediately walked to her table with a file in her hand without forgetting to pinch the wolf’s ears, which caused the wolf to shoot an annoyed glare at her. Ye Qingtang chuckled after having her way and then focused on the mission file.

The mission which the sect appointed to Zhou Xuan and the rest was to investigate the tragic case of the extermination of a family!
