Gu Yanqiu’s words really stunned Ye Qingtang. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Gu Yanqiu knew that his words were a little sudden as well. Usually, if they wanted to take on any mission, they would definitely not consider any new disciples. Since they just entered the sect, those new disciples were still not that skilled and, more than that, did not have any experience in completing missions. If such a person was added in a group, the person would only become a burden.

However, this time, Gu Yanqiu broke such a tradition.

Although Zhou Qu’s skills were not considered the best in the outer sect, it was still above average.

Just now when they reached the Rewards Pavilion, Ye Qingtang already exchanged blows with Zhou Qu, and they only saw Ye Qingtang’s last move.

But, it was exactly that one move that gave rise to the idea of adding Ye Qingtang into the group.

To be able to knockout Zhou Qu in a move, this new disciple was definitely not simple.

Ye Qingtang returned to her senses and could more or less guess the reason for it. According to the memory from her past life, Gu Yanqiu was quite skilled and adept at leading teams. Since it was a mission that he accepted, it should be pretty good.

Ye Qingtang herself came to the Rewards Pavilion to search for a suitable mission but could not find anything she liked after browsing for such a long time. Gu Yanqiu’s suggestion could be said to fit exactly with her wishes.

“I wonder what kind of mission Senior Brother Gu is talking about.”

A hint of approval quickly flashed across Gu Yanqiu’s eyes when he saw that Ye Qingtang was neither too humble nor too arrogant and merely a tad bit nervous.

“A few days ago, Junior Brother Qin and I just took on a hunting mission. The location is at the Giant Rock Canyon, and the target is a level 6 demonic beast. There is a rather large reward for this mission, with a total of over six hundred Xuanming points. I wonder if Junior Sister Ye is interested.”

Six hundred Xuanming points was a pretty good reward.

However, Ye Qingtang did not agree directly and asked, “How many people are you intending to recruit into the team for this mission?”

Regardless of how many Xuanming points there were, it was still important to see how many people the points were going to be split with.

Gu Yanqiu was rather shocked over Ye Qingtang’s question, but he answered honestly, “I intend to form a team of about ten people.”

A team of ten?

Ye Qingtang raised her brows slightly.

If the mission was completed, splitting six hundred Xuanming points amongst ten people meant that one person would get about sixty points each, and this was much more effective than those solo missions she saw.

Ye Qingtang roughly calculated the distance between Xuanling Sect and the Giant Rock Canyon and estimated that they should be able to return in half a month’s time if the team was capable enough.

Earning sixty Xuanming points in half a month was still relatively worth it.

After thinking for a moment, Ye Qingtang chuckled, “Count me in for this mission.”

Gu Yanqiu nodded.

“Senior Brother Gu, is there any other thing?” Ye Qingtang asked with a smile.

Gu Yanqiu shook his head.

“Then, just find me before we depart. I’ll head back first,” Ye Qingtang said smilingly.

This time, Gu Yanqiu did not ask her to stay again.

After watching Ye Qingtang leave, Qin Huan, who had already submitted the mission, saw Gu Yanqiu standing at the entrance of the Rewards Pavilion and went up to him playfully.

“That little junior sister left?” Qin Huan chuckled.

Gu Yanqiu gave a slight nod and said, “I have already invited her to participate in the Giant Rock Canyon mission.”

The smile on Qin Huan’s face froze slightly, and surprise filled his eyes.

Gu Yanqiu had always been cautious in forming his team and had the highest completion rate for the rewarded missions. Previously, Qin Huan indeed admired Ye Qingtang, but… he really did not expect that Gu Yanqiu, who had always been cautious, would suddenly pull a little junior sister he just met into the team.
