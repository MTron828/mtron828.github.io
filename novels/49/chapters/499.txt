“Ye Qingtang, did you come to Yunxiao Sect’s territory to court death?”

In the Imperial City, the Blood Moon Sect Elder had a strange expression as he was unable to understand Ye Qingtang’s thoughts.

“I have a sense of propriety,” Ye Qingtang said.

This Imperial City was only a distance away from Yunxiao Sect. According to the memories of her previous life, there was a mountain outside this city which belonged to Yunxiao Sect, where many of its outer sect disciples cultivated at.

As they talked, two young males walked into the tavern with great strides.

“Be careful. Don’t get caught. It’s Yunxiao Sect disciples…” The Blood Moon Elder warned softly.

Although Ye Qingtang and he were in disguise, they still had to be cautious. If they were discovered to be Xuanling Sect disciples, the consequences would be dire.

At that instant, Ye Qingtang suddenly stood up and walked to the table where the two males were sitting at.

“Are the two of you Yunxiao Sect disciples?” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Very quickly, Ye Qingtang was beside the table, and she asked with a smile.

“You can’t even recognize us, Yunxiao Sect disciples?” one of them said coldly.

“It’s correct then.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

“What do you mean?” the Yunxiao Sect disciple asked instinctively.

Swoosh!

Then, the smile on Ye Qingtang’s face disappeared, and she attacked the two Yunxiao Sect disciples without giving them any chance to react.

Boom!

Boom!

Along with the loud sounds, the two Yunxiao Sect disciples were sent flying from Ye Qingtang’s punch.

Everyone in the tavern stared in disbelief with their jaws hanging wide open at that instant.

There was actually someone in the Imperial City who dared to attack Yunxiao Sect disciples?!

After landing on the ground, the two Yunxiao Sect disciples spat blood.

Both of them were Yunxiao Sect’s outer sect disciples, and their martial skills were merely around the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two—similar to Fu Lingtian. How were they Ye Qingtang’s opponents?

“You… You dare to… provoke… Yunxiao Sect!!!” One of them looked at Ye Qingtang, appalled.

“Ha…” Ye Qingtang’s lips tugged up slightly. “What is Yunxiao Sect even! I will spare you two lowly people today. Remember, I am a Xuanling Sect disciple, and my name is Ye Qingtang!”

Afterward, Ye Qingtang waved and left with the Blood Moon Sect Elder, ignoring everyone’s gazes.

“Ye Qingtang, you are crazy!”

The Blood Moon Sect Elder shouted outside the tavern.

They initially still had time to hide from those Yunxiao Sect disciples, but Ye Qingtang actually dashed up to beat those two Yunxiao Sect disciples into a pulp with everyone watching her!

Ye Qingtang did not bother with the Blood Moon Sect Elder as her bright eyes looked far away.

Three Yunxiao Sect outer sect disciples were walking side by side, who seemed to be returning from the mountain.

“Ye Qingtang, you can’t be…” The Blood Moon Sect Elder was shocked when he saw the unusual glint in Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

Yet, when he just spoke, Ye Qingtang flashed across and arrived near the three Yunxiao Sect disciples.

“Are the three of you Yunxiao Sect disciples?” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“Are you blind? Do you still have to ask this kind of thing?” one of them said indifferently.

“That’s right then.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

Before the three people could react, Ye Qingtang attacked instantly.

These three people were Yunxiao Sect’s outer sect disciples whose skills were far from Ye Qingtang’s. Moreover, they did not have any precaution at all, allowing Ye Qingtang to succeed easily. In a jiffy, three bodies were flung far away like kites with broken strings.

“Who… Who are you… How dare you injure… Yunxiao Sect disciples!”
