Chapter 2418: Death Wish (2)

Lu Yuanxiang’s kind intentions sounded like a ridiculous joke to the ears of those from the Flying Star Academy. Not only did it fail to stop them, but it also made them feel that these two Netherworld Academy teams must have been so heavily injured from the earlier battle that they were just trying to trick them into not fighting.

Lu Yuanxiang wanted to tell everyone the truth and avoid an unnecessary bloodbath, but the Flying Star Academy teacher’s expression suddenly changed. In the blink of an eye, the Flying Star Academy folks charged toward Lu Yuanxiang and his team.

Their first targets were Lu Yuanxiang’s team, who were all grievously injured and unable to defend themselves.

“Be careful.” Ye Qingtang dragged Lu Yuanxiang behind her, before reaching out an open palm to meet the Flying Star Academy teacher’s fist!

A massive shockwave was emitted when his fist made contact.

“Protect the others.” Ye Qingtang instructed Lei Yan and the rest before flying toward the Flying Star Academy teacher in attack.

Ye Qingtang had already seen through the Flying Star Academy’s strategy. They planned to attack the vulnerable Lu Yuanxiang’s team first so that they could hold them as hostages to force Ye Qingtang’s team to hand over their demon crystals. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

As highly respected as an academy might be, they would still end up resorting to all sorts of nefarious means to win. Having already predicted this, Ye Qingtang was not at all surprised.

The moment the command was given, Lei Yan and his group immediately drew their weapons and met their opponents. Yun Chen and Song Yanhan stood in front of Lu Yuanxiang’s team to protect them, carefully observing their surroundings.

Song Yanhan’s hands were a little pale. As a medicine faculty student, he had never been in a real battle like this. He subconsciously glanced at Yun Chen and saw that there were no traces of fear on the other boy’s face. Instead, he looked combat-ready, arms wide open to protect Lu Yuanxiang’s team.

“Yun Chen, are you… not scared?” Song Yanhan swallowed hard.

Yun Chen was slightly taken aback before smiling.

“What is there to be scared of?”

Song Yanhan didn’t know how to reply. He had been under Zhu Ning all this while and enjoyed a high status in the school. As a result, he was used to a pampered existence and possessed an arrogant but more naive view of life.

He thought that this competition would purely be about the number of demons killed. But now, the danger was far beyond what he had imagined.

Another team was actually attacking them. The Flying Star Academy people were not at all surprised or angry even though they thought the Netherworld Academy folks had killed the Maple Night Academy team.

It was as though…

This was supposed to happen in this competition.

Apart from a medicine faculty student, the other 10 members of the Flying Star Academy threw themselves into the battle. Meanwhile, there were only nine people on Ye Qingtang’s side.

Very soon, the extra person snuck his way to Yun Chen’s proximity.

“Two medicine faculty students and a group of injured folks. I suggest that you obediently surrender, otherwise, you will be the ones to suffer.” The Flying Star Academy teenager surveyed his easy targets as he raised his sword in a threatening manner.

The Flying Star Academy teacher had planned this. The others would distract the nine fighters while he took the opportunity to hold the rest hostage.

All the medicine faculty students had a special emblem on their uniforms. As a result, they knew that Yun Chen and Song Yanhan were from the medicine faculty.
