Chapter 522: The Oncoming Storm (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Guardian’s meaning is… for us to attack them one by one. We will first attack the force that Yunxiao Sect sent out then… head to Yunxiao Sect to settle the scores…” the male with a sword, Shuo Tianzang, said.

“That’s right,” Ye Qingtang said without any emotions on her face. “Although Xuanling Sect cannot be compared to Yunxiao Sect, it has some heritages as well. Xuanling Sect would definitely not sit around and wait for death when Yunxiao Sect wants to annihilate them. At that time, there will definitely be a life and death struggle… When we assist Xuanling Sect at that time, not only will we gain Xuanling Sect’s gratitude, we can also borrow their strength to defeat Yunxiao Sect’s army together.”

The Blood Moon Elder was shaken. What was in Ye Qingtang’s head exactly? How could she even think of such a scheme?!

“Amazing!” The Blood Moon Division Head exclaimed in admiration. “Guardian’s scheme is indeed amazing. As such, with Xuanling Sect as cannon fodder, we can minimize our casualties to the lowest!”

At that moment, the Branch Masters in the hall were burning with battle desire.

Back then, the Holy Lord decreed that they rest and recuperate. After being trapped here for so many years, they finally welcomed a Blood Moon Guardian and could exercise their skills. This time, Yunxiao Sect would finally receive the rage of their Blood Moon Division!

“Pass the order down. We will set off today… and head to Xuanling Sect!” Ye Qingtang said strictly.

“Yes!”

Everyone replied in uniformity.

The Blood Moon Sect was indeed extremely efficient. In just an hour, hundreds of Blood Moon Sect members were gathered.

As the Blood Moon Elder witnessed everything, he was rather astonished. Ye Qingtang’s bold scheme actually succeeded for real.

Currently, Ye Qingtang was seated in a huge, red carriage.

Eight large demonic beasts had a huge metal chain on their necks as they pulled the carriage while moving forward. The Blood Moon Division Head and Branch Masters walked briskly by each side of the red carriage.

“Xuanling Sect… wait for me!” Ye Qingtang clenched her fists tightly with icy eyes.

…

At the same time, on Drifting Cloud Island.

A black demonic air surged in the sky, and rocks floated in the sky due to the resulting wild wind. It was like a scene in Hell, with almost no living being in the area due to the brutal force of the evil spirit.

Sometime later, the demonic air slowly dispersed, and a male appeared in the center.

Almost instantly, an ancient might suddenly exploded from the male’s body as though it was the reappearance of a true god from the primordial era that frightened the world and all beings.

A dark green pair of eyes gazed at the sky as though they could see through eons.

Long black hair cascaded down to his waist and swayed in the wind with an imposing aura.

Indifference was filled on Han Cangming’s face. As he waved, the remaining demonic aura vanished in an instant. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The spirit energy in this land… was ultimately not enough to repair his crumbling body…

Han Cangming was in deep thought. The veins on his neck reddened to a piercing sight.

“Your Highness.” Sometime later, Mu Su walked forward respectfully.

“Speak,” Han Cangming said without emotions.

“Recently, Lady Ye headed to the Blood Moon Sect…” Mu Su spoke. His Highness’s condition was very unstable these days, and even if he wished to leave Drifting Cloud Island, it was extremely difficult. His body would probably shatter should he be just a little careless.

After Ye Qingtang appeared on Drifting Cloud Island the other time, His Highness ordered him to send someone to observe Ye Qingtang’s condition.

Blood Moon Sect?

Han Cangming was indifferent.

“It is the sect that person founded a thousand years ago.”

“That’s right,” Mu Su nodded and said. “I learned that Yunxiao Sect has sent powerful figures in the sect to exterminate Xuanling Sect. I don’t know if it has any relations with Lady Ye heading to Blood Moon Sect.”
