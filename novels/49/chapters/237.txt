Chapter 236: Zombies (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang and Lin Long just left the pavilion but suddenly saw that the Spirit Condensation Mountain Village people had turned extremely crazy and were chasing after them.

“What’s going on? Do they not care about Wu Chengze’s life already?” Lin Long widened her eyes as she looked at the group of people that charged towards them powerfully in the night.

Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes and glanced across their bodies. A stern expression flashed across her eyes.

“The essence of the people from Spirit Condensation Mountain Village had all been sucked by the evil spirit. Now, they are merely zombies that only know how to attack.” When Ye Qingtang started speaking, she immediately sent Wu Chengze flying out with a kick.

Wu Chengze was useless already!

Terror filled Lin Long. While she had heard of evil spirits, she had absolutely zero understanding about such evil monsters that exist in legends.

“Go!” Ye Qingtang did not dare to waste any time as she grabbed Lin Long’s wrist and fled rapidly.

“Spirit Condensation Mountain Village does not pledge loyalty to evil spirits, but why…” Lin Long’s face had already lost all color.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes rapidly searched for an exit in the dark as she replied. “Since it is an evil spirit, how would it understand anything about pity? The Spirit Condensation Mountain Village people are all a group of idiots. How was completely resurrecting the evil spirit such an easy thing? By pledging loyalty to an evil spirit… they will only die sooner or later.”

Forming an alliance with evil spirits was the most foolish thing to do in this world.

Lin Long was astonished but knew that they could not afford any delays at that instant and, thus, quickly looked for an escape route with Ye Qingtang.

Behind them, hundreds of zombies chased after them with loud growls, turning the silent forest into hell. Their shrilling roars were like a nightmare that quietly descended, causing the beasts in the forest to take flight in fear.

Ye Qingtang pulled Lin Long to flee at top speed. Although the combat power of zombies was not strong, the evil spirit behind them would chase up once they were entangled with the zombies, and there would be no chance of escaping by then.

“Over there!” Ye Qingtang saw a stable not far away and sprinted over with Lin Long. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

There were two horses in the stable. As though sensing danger, the horses became uneasy and neighed in fear.

Just when Ye Qingtang and Lin Long was about to get on the horse, the zombies had already pounced on them. Ye Qingtang immediately waved a hand, beheading the zombies while cutting off the string that tied the horses into the stable at the same time!

“Go!”

With a shout, Ye Qingtang and Lin Long dashed out on their horses!

The horses neighed and lifted their hoofs, crushing the heads of a few zombies. Blood sputtered out in the dim night. Ye Qingtang and Lin Long did not dare to stop and immediately rode out at top speed.

However… just as they were about to leave the stable, Zhou Xuan, who escaped one step earlier, suddenly flew towards them and stabbed through Lin Long’s shoulder with his sword. When Lin Long fell off the horse from the pain, Zhou Xuan immediately got on Lin Long’s horse and fled.

“Zhou Xuan!” Death filled Ye Qingtang’s eyes. When she saw Lin Long falling off from the horse, Ye Qingtang did not hesitate at all and instantly jumped down from the horse which was galloping madly, catching Lin Long, and tumbling on the ground with Lin Long in her arms. Looking at Zhou Xuan’s gradually-disappearing back view, she flashed a murderous expression in her eyes. She lifted her arm in a flash, and an arrow from her hidden blade shot right at Zhou Xuan’s back.

Zhou Xuan’s shoulder was suddenly shot, and he fell off the horse!

In the dark night, the horses ran away after sensing danger, and the last chance to escape was lost just like that!

How Ye Qingtang wished she could twist Zhou Xuan’s neck until it broke!
