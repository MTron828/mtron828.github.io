Chapter 1520 Age Reversal Curse 2

What is going on?

Ye Qingtang was utterly shocked by the sight before her.

Her eyes swept across the small children with old facial features, and a shocking thought emerged in her mind suddenly.

It had already been more than ten thousand years since Jiang Yu left the Jiang Family. Furthermore, Jiang Yu and his wife were very in love, and after his wife passed, he suffered an extremely huge blow and left the Jiang Family not long later.

The members of the Jiang Family believed that Jiang Yu had ascended to the Second Domain, but now...

Ye Qingtang could not help but doubt this rumor.

Just as Ye Qingtang was overwhelmed with surprise, a well-built kid walked toward Jiang Yu with his hands behind his back and looked at him with a slight frown.

“Jiang Yu, no matter whether you agree or not, your destruction of the temple angered the gods and caused the gods to lay a barrier and curse to this forbidden area. We have been trapped within this barrier for thousands of years and are cursed with the Age Reversal Curse. If this goes on, I’m afraid that in a few years’ time, we will also turn from children into nothing just like the Eternal Emperor and the others...”

Age Reversal Curse?

A trace of astonishment hit Ye Qingtang when she heard that term.

The Age Reversal Curse was a curse of the gods. The gods placed this curse on those who offended the gods, and anyone who was cursed would degenerate in the opposite direction as compared to normal people, regardless of how old or powerful they were.

Even a white-haired elderly would change into a young baby in less than a hundred years under the Age Reversal Curse. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

This curse that was almost similar to returning to one’s youth seemed extremely tempting.

However, with sufficient martial realm, a cultivator’s life could be extended indefinitely, and living over millions of years was not an issue.

Yet, the Age Reversal Curse would put an end to a cultivator’s life.

A person’s age would decrease continuously, and they would grow from old age to midlife to youth and subsequently to childhood... Once they turned into an infant, they were not far from death.

Furthermore, a cultivator’s skill would decline alongside his degeneration.

Ye Qingtang looked in shock at the old children and finally understood why she was so astounded.

According to their conversation, Ye Qingtang vaguely guessed some clues.

Jiang Yu was the Jiang Family’s Domain Monarch Founder, and after the death of his wife, he heard that a temple in the Land of Infinite Demons could bring his wife back to life.

Thus, he kneeled and prayed in that temple for thousands of years in hopes of gaining sympathy from the gods.

Nonetheless, thousands of years of sincere prayer failed to exchange for the gods’ compassion. Enraged, Jiang Yu destroyed the temple, which inadvertently angered the gods. The gods then laid a curse to this forbidden land and turned this place into a true forbidden land.

Emperor Yan and the rest probably entered this forbidden land during that period of time, were cursed with the Age Reversal Curse by the gods, and were sealed behind the waterfall by the barrier.

The once supreme and dominant powerful figures were now, however, trapped within this barrier while bearing the Age Reversal Curse, where they slowly degenerated from tall and mighty figures into little children who only reached Ye Qingtang’s thighs...

Ye Qingtang glanced at the pile of tattered clothes within the barrier. It seemed that over the years, many powerful figures had already degenerated into infancy and then into nothing...
