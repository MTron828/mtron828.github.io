Chapter 1708: Tasting the Consequences (3)

On their way home, they ran into Jiang Yiran, who was on his way to help them. Other than Jiang Yanyun who was still recovering from his wounds, everyone else had come, and they learnt from them that they had already found the votes and Ye Qingtang was the top beauty in the championship.

The news made Jiang Yiran shout with joy, and they returned to their residence.

Now that Ye Qingtang had helped the Jiang family regain their image, the youths of the Jiang family treated her much better.

Once evening fell, the youths who had not managed to get into the top ten would have to leave the Island of Immortal Footsteps with their elders and return to their own clans.

Ye Qingtang and Jiang Shaobai would remain on the island and enter the mystic realm tomorrow. They would see the rest of the Jiang family off today.

Jiang Yisheng was crying miserable, snot and tears everywhere as he touched Jiang Shaobai all over. It was all Jiang Shaobai could do to not kick him to death.

As they were arguing, they caught sight of the Mu family. A slim figure with a straw hat and a veil covering a face caught their attention.

“That’s odd, where is Mu Ruxue?” Jiang Yisheng craned his neck to look but still couldn’t catch a glimpse of her.

Jiang Shaobai rushed towards the figure in the veil and lifted his chin as his fingers twitched slightly. A gust of wind blew towards her, lifting the hat up.

As the hat dropped towards the ground, it revealed the nauseating view of a face which was rotting.

The various clans were all present and someone let out a shriek, attracting the attention of everyone else. Their gazes swept over and they were all shocked as they saw the rotting face.

“My god, what in the devil is that? How is it possible that someone so ugly exists?”

“Oh my God, I’m about to throw up. I don’t remember seeing someone this ugly in the Mu family.”

A few youths frowned in utter disgust.

The woman shrieked and as she quickly tried to hide her face. She rolled up pathetically among the Mu family members, not daring to lift her face an inch.

“Is that... Mu Ruxue?” Jiang Yisheng saw that there was a jade pendant on the neck of the ugly woman. Wasn’t that the pendant that Mu Ruxue had on her everyday?

“I already said, there was no way she wasn’t going to fulfill her end of the bet.” Jiang Shaobai smiled and lifted his eyes to look at Ye Qingtang. “Elder Sister Qingtang, I helped you seek revenge. How are you going to repay me?”

Ye Qingtang stared in shock at Jiang Shaobai’s beautiful, smiling face. She suddenly remembered him grabbing Mu Ruxue’s hand.

Could it be...

Jiang Shaobai had poisoned her then?

“It’s not easy to find beauty. Elder Sister Qing, I had to spend quite a lot of effort to find it,” Jiang Shaobai said as he smiled.

This “beauty” he was referring to was a type of insidious poison. It would not harm a person’s life, but would make their features rot irreversibly. There was currently no antidote either...

Ye Qingtang looked at Jiang Shaobai, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. Even though she was speechless, her heart still warmed.

“Shaobai, you really are amazing,” Jiang Yisheng admired Jiang Shaobai’s method. Mu Ruxue valued her looks greatly and wouldn’t dare to leave the house ever again now that she was in such a state.

This punishment was harsh enough for someone who had try to commit murder!
