Chapter 1623: Mission Countdown (4)

At this instant, both camps on the battlefield were dumbfounded by the scene before them.

What is going on?

The Glorious Kingdom Protector... died... just like that?

How can this be?!

Even if the allied forces took into account that Ye Qingtang was not as weak as she appeared... she should not be strong to the extent... that she could kill a Kingdom Protector with a strike and a kick, right?

The Supreme League King’s initial worries completely vanished upon witnessing the scene, and he looked at Ye Qingtang with deep admiration.

In the allied forces, the Monza King witnessed Ye Qingtang’s formidable powers and felt his lips twitch.

No wonder the Supreme League King was unwilling to exchange Ye Qingtang regardless of the conditions...

“We can’t go on like this. The Supreme League Kingdom initiated the war and violated the mainland convention. If we still insist on upholding the mainland convention and forbid the Kingdom Protectors from joining the war, who will stop the Supreme League Kingdom’s ambitions?!” The Monza King suddenly spoke and persuaded the other kings in the allied forces.

Only Kingdom Protectors could contend with a Kingdom Protector. Although they brought over sixty million soldiers, they would still suffer great losses even if they managed to conquer the Supreme League Kingdom fortress should they not eliminate Ye Qingtang first.

The various Kings who initially took into account the mainland convention were completely wavering after witnessing how Ye Qingtang killed the Glorious Kingdom Protector in a second.

Then, all of them made the decision to dispatch all the Kingdom Protectors in the troops.

In no time, dozens of Kingdom protectors appeared on the battlefield uniformly.

“How shameless are the allied forces? They actually sent so many Kingdom Protectors? What do they want? Bullying us by outnumbering us?!” The Supreme League Kingdom Knights were infuriated.

No matter how powerful Ye Qingtang was, she was no opponent for the unified attack of this many Kingdom Protectors!

Emotions of anxiety and worry instantly rose again in everyone.

“Your Majesty, I am willing to fight the war with Lord Protector!” Joseph, who was previously annoyed with Ye Qingtang, had already become the biggest worshipper of Ye Qingtang now.

“Your Majesty, let us fight the war!”

The King’s brows were locked tightly, and he had a serious look on his face.

Seeing that the King did not reply, Joseph and the rest ran down by themselves and opened the fortress gates, wanting to fight the enemy with their powerful Lord Protector.

However...

Just as the door opened, Ye Qingtang heard a sound and stirred up a strong blast of wind with her palm, closing the fortress gates tightly.

“Stay in there obediently,” Ye Qingtang said.

She was going to complete her mission very soon. Why were they still rushing out to give her more trouble?

Ye Qingtang did not speak much, but Joseph and the rest were unaware of her feelings. They were under the misunderstanding that she did not allow them to join the battle because she sensed danger, and this assumption made them moved and anxious instantly.

The numerous Kingdom Protectors were from different kingdoms and were extremely powerful. At this instant, they encircled Ye Qingtang and were ready to get rid of this girl who violated the mainland convention.

Ye Qingtang glanced at all the Kingdom Protectors individually.

“All of you... can come on together.”

She did not wish to waste time.
