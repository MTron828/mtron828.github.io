Chapter 1153: Pagoda Sword Master (2)

At this instant, the You Ancient Clan people attacked immediately and formed several prints with their palms.

Subsequently, an almost-substantive screen appeared in the air and trapped everyone in it.

The sword aura that shot out from Pagoda Sword Master’s eyes immediately slashed the screen, and a deafening noise erupted.

“Humph!”

Ultimate Elder scoffed loudly, and he leaned forward, twisting the surrounding space. The sword shadow that Pagoda Sword Master slashed out entered the twisted space, and the next time the sword shadow appeared, it was already thrust into the screen by the twisted space.

“Puff!”

Several You Ancient Clan disciples had their necks slit by the Pagoda Sword Master’s sword shadow and died at the scene.

Almost instantly, the three Generals of You Ancient Clan leaped toward Ultimate Elder and Pagoda Sword Master, causing an overpowering aura to fill the air.

In just the blink of an eye, both sides were locked in a battle.

Seeing that the battle was increasing in violence, the Blood Moon Elder quietly walked to Ye Qingtang’s side and whispered softly. “Holy Lady… Let’s run first!”

They originally thought that they would definitely die, but unexpectedly, Ultimate Elder and even Pagoda Sword Master, who had disappeared from this mainland for a long time, rushed over.

Now that Ultimate Elder and Pagoda Sword Master were engaged in a tight battle, it was a good chance for them to flee!

However, it was as though Ye Qingtang did not hear Blood Moon Elder’s suggestion, and her attention was completely focused on the battlefield.

It was not that Ye Qingtang did not wish to take this chance to escape but…

She discovered that as the battle intensified, the spirit energy on this mainland expanded immediately, and this mainland was about to burst from the spirit energy that they discharged.

Regardless of Ultimate Elder, Pagoda Sword Master, or those powerful figures from You Ancient Clan…

Their skills had already exceeded the limit of this mainland, and this excess may not be completely leveled even if their skills were suppressed.

In this intense battle, the powerful figures executed their skills brazenly.

The dangerous amount of force that exceeded the spirit energy of this mainland was a constant assault to this mainland’s tolerance of spirit energy…

Uneasiness crept into Ye Qingtang’s heart. The martial culture of this mainland had always been low, and there were few powerful figures such as Ultimate Elder, Pagoda Sword Master, and Blood Moon Holy Lord; thus, their appearance would not have much influence on this mainland.

However if…

The number of such powerful figures suddenly inflated in the same area, and these powerful figures unleashed their powers at the same time…

How could this mainland be able to withstand this bout-like assault?

By then…

This mainland would explode due to the inability to withstand so much force!

Ye Qingtang frowned inadvertently at that thought. If it was really as she guessed…

Everyone on this mainland would die regardless of the You Ancient Clan’s attack!

At this instant, more and more You Ancient Clan figures rushed over from all sides!

The Ultimate Elder and the Pagoda Sword Master were facing three You Ancient Clan generals. Although they were not at a disadvantage yet, the arrival of more You Ancient Clan figures eventually saw the strain of even Pagoda Sword Master, the man known as the most powerful figure of this mainland.
