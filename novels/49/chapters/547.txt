Chapter 548 Blood Moon Holy Lord (4)

Now that the Yunxiao Sect divine beast struck, it saved lots of effort for them.

The Elders and remaining disciples of Yunxiao Sect wore a proud expression when they saw their divine beast attacking.

Their Yunxiao Sect’s divine beast was extremely powerful! RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Even if another person at the level of a Blood Moon Sect Elder came, it would be no big deal.

That divine beast cried fiercely and attacked the silver-haired man with its golden beak.

Fear arose in the hearts of the Xuanling Sect masses at the sight.

Xuanling Sect’s golden formation was broken by the Yunxiao Sect divine beast’s beak. Who in this world could block an attack of the beak?!

However…

The corners of the blood-colored long robe swayed, and the man’s silver hair tousled in the air.

An appalling scene played out in this world.

There was no change in emotions in the silver-haired man’s eyes while his face was still as cold as a glacier.

Standing in midair silently, he slowly pointed out a finger towards that invincible beak.

Boom!

A frightening explosion erupted.

In the next second, the sound of the explosion reverberated hundreds of miles around the area.

Before everyone’s eyes of disbelief, the silver-haired man used a finger and gently nipped the Yunxiao Sect divine beast’s beak.

Swoosh!

The enormous body of the divine beast was flung several miles away instantly.

Then, the Yunxiao Sect divine beast was rammed into an old mountain that was hundreds of meters tall.

What followed right on the heels was a scene that rendered many speechless.

The old mountain was crushed into pieces immediately, and countless of huge rocks fell like a rainstorm. The entire mountain turned into dust!

The silver-haired man’s expression was calm, and it was as though he had not done anything.

At that instant, the scene was dead silent. It was as though everyone forgot to breathe, and only the faint throbbing of hearts could be heard.

The smile on the Yunxiao Sect Elders’ faces froze completely before turning into expressions of indescribable horror and shock.

Only Li Chenfeng shut his eyes as a look of suppression filled his face.

Both Yuehua Sect and Lingyun Sect were overwhelmed with horror as they looked at that silver-haired man as if what happened was an illusion.

Below in Xuanling Sect, the sect disciples were dumbfounded. Their lips twitched and mouths opened, but not a single word came out.

Xuanling Sect Master, Elder Mo, Elder Qin, and others were stunned and did not return to their senses for a long time.

Ye You’s expression changed immediately.

The Yunxiao Sect divine beast… was actually… by that silver-haired man…

“You…”

Shock was written all over Ye Qingtang’s face as she looked at the imposing figure that stood upright and tall before her.

“Holy Lord!”

The Blood Moon Elder was the first to return to his senses as he rushed over rapidly and knelt before the silver-haired man.

“We pay our respects… to the Holy Lord!”

The Blood Moon Division Head, Shuo Tianzang, Blood Demon, and other Branch Masters greeted in unison with eyes filled with ardent worship, as they knelt beside the silver-haired man

“Blood Moon… He is… is…”

The high-ranking executives of Yuehua Sect and Lingyun Sect were dumbfounded.

Blood Moon Sect’s supreme… Blood Moon Holy Lord…

A thousand years ago when Blood Moon Sect was attacked by the combined forces of hundreds of sects, the Blood Moon Holy Lord appeared at the last moment and swept the sects away by himself like a real god, making the powerful figures in the sects aware of the differences between a human and a god.
