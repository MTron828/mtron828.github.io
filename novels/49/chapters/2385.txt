Chapter 2386: Endure (2)

Wen Qi could permit Ye Qing’s plan, but he would not be able to change the opinions of others. He was worried that Ye Qing would have to endure intense criticism following the decision.

Some of the veteran Netherworld Academy teachers had been unconvinced of a teacher as young as Ye Qing. With Di Nuo’s departure, even more teachers believed that Ye Qing was too impulsive.

Wen Qi was worried that after the individual martial arts competition, Ye Qing would have to endure unprecedented pressure.

“I don’t mind,” Ye Qingtang replied.

Wen Qi looked at Ye Qing with relief. After speaking a few more words with him, he allowed the youth to leave.

…

The next morning, students from the various academies set off for the competition arena. Today, they would draw lots to see who their opponents would be. The exciting sparring competitions would officially begin today.

Lei Yan and the others woke early and dressed themselves up neat and proper. They then stood in a row outside Ye Qing’s room, waiting for their Boss to lead them to the arena.

But after waiting for some time, Ye Qing still hadn’t opened her door.

“Did Boss oversleep?” Lei Yan murmured.

Today was a big day. Why did their Boss choose to oversleep today?

“Don’t tell me we really angered Boss that badly yesterday?” Nangong Lie asked sheepishly.

The teenagers exchanged looks. They saw that nearly all of the students in North Hall had already left. But they couldn’t decide whether they should knock on her door.

In the end, Qin Feng looked at Mu Ziying.

“Little Senior Sister, we have to trouble you again.” Qin Feng spoke earnestly.

Mu Ziying, “…”

The brats knew very well that Ye Qing would never lose his temper at Mu Ziying. Their Little Senior Sister was their lucky charm. They had never seen Boss being fierce to her.

Once again being forced by the others, Mu Ziying went forward to knock on the door in resignation.

“Boss… are you awake?” Mu Ziying called out.

Not long after Mu Ziying called out, the door was finally opened. Ye Qing had a coat hastily draped across his shoulders, his long, black hair casually pulled back in a loose ponytail. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

He did not look like someone who was prepared to head out at all.

“Boss, wake up. We won’t be able to make it if we don’t go now.” Nangong Lie urged.

“Go where?” Ye Qingtang was still groggy.

“The drawing of lots for the sparring matches.”

Ye Qingtang yawned. “You guys don’t need to draw lots. Go back.”

“What?!”

The teenagers were all stunned.

No need to draw lots?

What was Boss saying?

“But… Teacher Ye, what do you mean? Do you mean we don’t need to be there personally for the drawing of the lots?” The usually shy Qiu Nan asked in a timid manner.

Ye Qingtang looked at their confused faces. “I mean that you guys don’t need to participate in the individual martial arts competition.”

Ye Qing’s words were like a bolt of lightning striking their heads.

“Boss! We know we were in the wrong! We are immature and ignorant. We are foolish and stupid. Please have mercy and give us a chance! We have already reflected on ourselves the entire night. Please don’t be so angry anymore!” Lei Yan was the first to snap out of his trance. He threw himself at Ye Qing’s feet with a cry, clutching onto Ye Qing’s thigh as he wailed pitifully.

Their Boss was so enraged by their behavior yesterday?

Boss wanted to give up and didn’t even want to let them participate in the Inter-Academy Competition anymore?!
