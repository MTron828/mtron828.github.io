Chapter 1579 Two Star Constellation 1

The youths that hung around Jiang Shaobai were around the second or third heaven of the Heavenly Venerate realm, not to speak of the others.“It would be wonderful if I was at the Temple of Shadows... Then I might have been able to enter the Illusory Void to train.” Ye Qingtang could not help thinking of the Illusory Void in the Temple of Shadows. Although the God of Nature was not very reliable, the Illusory Void was a wonderful thing. Too bad that it was not realistic for her to return to the Temple of Shadows.

Just as Ye Qingtang was thinking about it again, she suddenly felt a strange warmth coming from her wrist.

Ye Qingtang looked down, puzzled. The Nine Souls Ring on her wrist that had belonged to the Holy Lord of Shadows was now glowing with a blinding light.

For a moment, Ye Qingtang could not figure out why it was glowing, and she was enveloped by the glow.

Ye Qingtang was blinded by the bright light, but the Illusory Void’s voice rang in her ears. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Fortunate explorer, welcome back to the Illusory Void.”

Isn’t that the God of Nature’s voice?!

Ye Qingtang was startled. The blinding light faded. What appeared before her eyes was not her room in Taiyuan Valley, but the nebula filled Illusory Void that she had bid farewell to some time ago...

The God of Nature’s radiant body floated before her eyes...

“...” A look of surprise flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes, and she glanced at the Nine Souls Ring on her wrist.

The Nine Souls Ring originally belonged to the Holy Lord of Shadows, and the Illusory Void had been sealed in the Temple by the Holy Lord of Shadows herself. Perhaps the Holy Lord of Shadows had left her imprint on her private possessions, turning it into a key to the Illusory Void...

That way, the Holy Lord of Shadows could enter the Illusory Void whenever she liked, even if she was not in the Temple of Shadows.

“Fortunate explorer, which constellation would you like to enter this time?” The languid radiant body floated and shifted around before Ye Qingtang’s eyes. Its tone was solemn and calm, but Ye Qingtang could discern a thread of anticipation in its voice.

As the radiant body’s voice rang out, the surrounding constellations drifted forth as if they would swallow her at any moment.

Ye Qingtang glanced at the various constellations.

She had chosen the one-star constellation previously because it was lowest-ranked and would allow her to advance the most.

Ye Qingtang knew that the higher the constellation level, the greater the effect it would have on her cultivation. But having experienced the one-star constellation, Ye Qingtang realized that although it could increase her cultivation state within a short time, she would need a period of refinement before she could fully grasp it.

Also, since she could enter the Illusory Void anytime, she could take her time.

So Ye Qingtang lifted her hand and pointed at the two-star constellation.

“...” said the radiant body.

Ye Qingtang could vaguely hear the radiant body muttering. But when she glanced at it, the radiant body appeared normal.

“You really won’t consider the others? The four-star constellation is pretty good.” The radiant body seemed to want to promote the other constellations.

Ye Qingtang had personally experienced the high-level constellations that the radiant body had termed the “best” and “most suitable.” She had almost died there, so she chose to pass over any of the radiant body’s recommendations.

“No need. I’ll go there first,” said Ye Qingtang.

The radiant body seemed rather wistful. It slowly summoned the two-star constellation. Then, Ye Qingtang picked up the little white tiger, who had been sprawled on her, and flew straight into the two-star constellation.
