Chapter 2086: Temple of Paragon (2)

Ming Wang had never imagined that they would cross paths with the Temple of Paragon one day.

Even though the Crimson League was a huge power in the Second Domain, the power of the Temple of Paragon was beyond them and they were an entity that normal people couldn’t even dream of touching.

The Crimson League probably wouldn’t even be able to reach their front gate even if they all attacked together.

For the first time in his life, Ming Wang was experiencing a huge gap in his abilities.

Ming Gu was stunned.

“But Ah Yao...”

“The Temple of Paragon has never come into contact with Mo Yao before. The mainland that the Temple of Paragon is at is different from the mainland that we are at as well, so maybe taking Mo Yao away is nothing bad after all,” Mi said.

But he had no idea why they had taken her.

He was just glad that he knew someone from the Temple of Paragon.

That person had for some reason appeared in the First Domain and Mi had met him coincidentally when they were fighting the Ancient You Clan. But he had vanished suddenly after that, which made Mi extremely puzzled.

However...

Given that he was from the Temple of Paragon, it meant he wasn’t someone Mi could question easily. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Ming Gu wanted to speak but Ming Wang pushed him forward. In front of them, the air was filled with ashes and the smell of burnt flesh. As Ming Gu looked at everything around him, he felt as though someone was squeezing his throat.

The people from the Temple of Paragon had reduced the Heavenly Wolf Sect and Ancient You Clan troops to ash with just a lift of their hand. What terrifying power...

Seeing that Ming Gu was still in shock, Ming Wang sighed deeply and looked at Mi.

“The Central Mainland accepted us back previously, but now that everything in the Central Mainland has settled down, are we still allowed to return to the Second Domain?”

Mi looked at Ming Wang. Even though Ye Qingtang had been taken away right in front of him, Ming Di was still here, which meant that they still qualified to return to the Crimson League.

He nodded slightly.

Ming Wang’s eyes filled with determination. As long as they returned to the Second Domain, they might be able to see Ye Qingtang.

...

On the mountain, a slim figure stood between the bamboo plants. He was looking at the scorched earth as well as the Crimson League and Temple of Shadows members discussing at the foot of the mountain.

The azure dragon stood to the side looking at Ling Yan, who was the one standing among the bamboo plants.

Ling Yan hadn’t left like Ye Qingtang thought he did. He had brought the azure dragon to this mountain and personally witnessed the entire battle.

Which meant he had seen with his own two eyes Ye Qingtang being taken away by the Six-Winged Fire Phoenix.

After seeing all of this, he turned and walked back towards the Temple of Shadows. At this moment, the Crimson League troops and the Temple of Shadows forces were still on the battlefield and the Temple of Shadows was empty. He walked through the quiet main hall towards the underground path and walked to the Hall of Gloom.

Lighting the fire on the wall, once again the almost illusionary pagoda appeared in front of him.

The azure dragon looked at him strangely. But before he could speak, Ling Yan climbed onto the pagoda, opened the altar where the Spirit of Chaos was placed and put the fragments and the container inside.

“So you’ve had your eye on the Spirit of Chaos this entire time, Ling Yan.” The azure dragon looked at Ling Yan with a complicated expression as he climbed up the pagoda.
