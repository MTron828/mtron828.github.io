Chapter 2385: Endure (1)

“Yun Chen is at the Divine Lord stage?” Wen Qi felt that he must have misheard.

Before the Netherworld Academy selection trials, Ye Qingtang had six students under her and Yun Chen was the only one from the medicine faculty. Under her guidance, the other five had broken through to the Divine Lord stage within a short period of time. They had become the hottest topic in the Netherworld Academy.

Meanwhile, Yun Chen’s significant improvement in elixir-refinement had also garnered much attention. As for the level of his martial art, no one paid much notice to that.

As Wen Qi looked at her doubtfully, Ye Qingtang gave a steady nod of her head. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Wen Qi, “…”

“With Yun Chen’s martial arts level, it should not be a problem for him to come with us into the Wailing Well…”

Before Ye Qingtang could finish her sentence, Wen Qi waved. “Let me think for a minute.”

Ye Qingtang, “…”

Think about what?

Wen Qi carefully considered Ye Qing’s words. After confirming he had not misunderstood, he looked at her with a conflicted expression. “Do you mean that Yun Chen is already at the Divine Lord level now?”

Ye Qingtang nodded.

“When did he break through to that stage?” Wen Qi asked again.

Ye Qingtang replied, “Probably around the same time as Lei Yan and the others.”

Wen Qi gasped.

Yun Chen was part of the martial arts faculty when he first joined the Netherworld Academy. He only switched to the medicine faculty due to his physical issues. But…

Was Ye Qing telling him now that Yun Chen was already at the Divine Lord stage? And that he had broken through at around the same time as Lei Yan and the rest?

Wen Qi’s expression grew increasingly complicated.

“That’s to say all six of the students under you have already ascended to the Divine Lord level?”

Ye Qingtang nodded.

Wen Qi felt rather flustered.

All six had been handed over to Ye Qing at the same time, and every single one of them had a different problem. But somehow Ye Qing was able to bring all these six teenagers onto the Divine Lord level?

Impossible.

Wen Qi had been in teaching for several decades but this was the first time he had encountered such a formidable teacher. Even Wu Fengling did not produce this level of success.

What kind of wonderful freak of nature was this Ye Qing?

“Alright, arrange things according to your plans.” Wen Qi could no longer object. He was even thinking that he might have been too conservative in only giving Ye Qing six students then. If he had given him more, wouldn’t they have more Divine Lord level students now?

“Alright,” Ye Qingtang replied.

Wen Qi sighed. He looked at Ye Qing with gratitude. “Ye Qing, you are even more exemplary than I imagined. But I must remind you of one point.”

“Vice-President, please go ahead.”

Wen Qi continued. “I am permitting you to carry out your plan, but you must be mentally prepared. Ran Mo and Qin Feng are the two most talented martial students in our academy. They are under you now and according to your arrangements, they cannot participate in the individual martial arts competition. Apart from them, our other martial arts students have no chance at all of squeezing into the top 10. We will suffer a terrible defeat during that competition…”

Wen Qi had his own worries.

After suffering that massive defeat, the entire Netherworld Academy would be full of dismay. And Ye Qing, who was the one who didn’t allow Ran Mo and Qin Feng to participate, would definitely bear the brunt of that outrage.
