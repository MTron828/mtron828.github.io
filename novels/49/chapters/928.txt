Chapter 929 Trade-Offs (5)

“Lord Divine Phoenix, I don’t want the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix. I want this!” After a moment, the man in black armor spoke to the Divine Phoenix.

What of the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix? Just the Mirror of Illusions was enough!

“Alright.” The Divine Phoenix nodded. “But I need to warn you that the Mirror of Illusions was refined by the ancestor of the Divine Phoenix. Only those of the Divine Phoenix’s bloodline can use it. To someone without the bloodline of the Divine Phoenix, it will just be a piece of useless metal.”

“You need to have the bloodline of the Divine Phoenix to use it?!”

The man in black armor was stunned. Then, he frowned and said, “Lord Divine Phoenix… I don’t have the bloodline of the Divine Phoenix. But as everyone saw with their own eyes, I used the Mirror of Illusions just now.”

“That’s because this is the place of my death. The surroundings are imbued with the power of my bloodline, and that’s why you could use it.” The Divine Phoenix explained.

When he heard the Divine Phoenix’s words, the eyes of the man in black armor were immediately veiled with immense disappointment.

In that case, even if the Mirror of Illusions fell into his hands, it would be completely useless. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“The bloodline of the phoenix can use it…”

Amongst the group, a delicate-looking girl looked thoughtful. A hot luster shone in her eyes. But the luster quickly vanished, and she returned to normal.

“Although some of the Dharma treasures here cannot compare to the Mirror of Illusions, they are not very different in terms of grade.” The Divine Phoenix spoke again.

When he heard that, the man in black armor cheered up and went to select another Dharma treasure.

The others had personally witnessed the power of the Mirror of Illusions, and their thoughts had also changed.

The inheritance of the Divine Phoenix might be good.

But ultimately, only one person could obtain it. None of them could be sure that they would be the lucky one.

If they stood firm and did not obtain the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix, they might also not be destined to have these Dharma treasures.

After weighing the pros and cons, almost everyone chose to select a Dharma treasure that they were certain to get.

After all, the value of these Dharma treasures was already sufficient for them. They did not have to fight to the end for the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix.

As the saying goes…

A bird in hand was better than two in the bush.

As everyone was choosing their Dharma treasure, there were two figures that did not move.

“Are the two of you intending to forgo these Dharma treasures?”

The Divine Phoenix looked at Ye Qingtang and a girl in green, who had not chosen a Dharma treasure.

At that moment, only the two of them had not moved.

“Lord Divine Phoenix, I wish to try for the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix,” the girl in green said.

“Me too.” Ye Qingtang replied.

Ling Yan had told her that the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix would surely be hers. For some reason, to date, Ye Qingtang had great faith in Ling Yan’s judgment and did not doubt it in the least.

Otherwise, Ye Qingtang would certainly have taken the Mirror of Illusions and left.

Since Ling Yan had personally said it, Ye Qingtang would believe him this time.

The Divine Phoenix nodded after obtaining Ye Qingtang and the girl in green’s responses.

The Divine Phoenix looked at Absolute Monarch of Heaven and the other ten over people and said, “These Dharma treasures are part of the inheritance. Since you have obtained these Dharma treasures, it is equivalent to obtaining part of the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix. However, there is a condition.”

“What condition is it?” Absolute Monarch of Heaven asked.

“In the future, you cannot be at odds with the Divine Phoenix’s successor. As far as possible, you must help and assist the Divine Phoenix,” the Divine Phoenix said.

“I see. I agree.” Absolute Monarch of Heaven thought for a while and agreed readily.

The Divine Phoenix was probably doing this to pave the way for the only person who obtained the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix.
