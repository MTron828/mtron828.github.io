Outside the main entrance of Xuanling Sect, Gu Yanqiu and the rest had already arrived.

Ye Qingtang arrived just on time. The moment she exited the door, she saw Qin Huan rushing up towards her.

“How is it, little junior sister? You’ve received the things, haven’t you?” Qin Huan asked with a smile so bright that was comparable to a sunny day.

Ye Qingtang replied very calmly, “I received it. Many thanks, senior brother.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“…”

Could it be that I became uglier recently?

Just when Qin Huan was pondering about why his ever-successful smile failed on Ye Qingtang every single time, Ye Qingtang placed the fire-resistant soft armor that she prepared long ago in his hands.

“This is?” Qin Huan looked at the soft armor and thought that the item was pretty interesting as that there was a surge of warmth in his hands.

“A gift in return,” Ye Qingtang replied.

“…”

Little junior sister, how much do you despise me that you’re unwilling to owe me even a small favor!

While Qin Huan accepted the gift, the complaints and sadness within him intensified.

Gu Yanqiu walked over at this time and said, “Junior Sister Ye, there are two more people left. We will wait for a while more.”

Ye Qingtang nodded.

Qin Huan was extroverted and had always been lively while Gu Yanqiu was silent and disliked speaking too much. If he said anything, they were definitely useful words.

In the whole team, Ye Qingtang was a little more familiar to only these two people, but she did not try to get closer to the rest of the team as well.

Rather, it was Meng Sheng who wore an ugly expression once Ye Qingtang appeared.

Clearly, he was still not too satisfied with Ye Qingtang as his last-minute teammate.

“Senior Brother Meng, don’t take it to heart already. Just take it as giving Senior Brother Gu face. That little junior sister is pretty good-looking. Didn’t you see Qin Huan protecting her so persistently? For all we may know, this is someone Qin Huan likes, and Senior Brother Gu only invited her to join us because he was showing Qin Huan face,” another disciple in the team laughed.

“Qin Huan doesn’t even know to restrain himself. Sooner or later, he will get into trouble,” Meng Sheng said coldly.

Qin Huan’s nature was to flirt with pretty junior sisters when he had nothing to do, and they no longer minded it. However, it was good that Qin Huan knew when to stop and kept business and personal issues separate; thus, they did not bother too much about it.

But this time, Meng Sheng was a little unhappy.

However, on Gu Yanqiu’s account, he did not say any more ugly words.

A while later, the other two disciples hurried over.

All ten members arrived. Previously, Gu Yanqiu had already reported to the outer sect elder about their journey. At that instant, they were all outside the sect and above the clouds, standing in the sky while being surrounded by mist.

“Let’s go,” Gu Yanqiu said.

In the next second, the Path to Heaven that they had to go through during the entrance assessment appeared before them. Light shone from the cloud and straight onto the ground.

Everyone stepped on the Path to Heaven and walked down from Xuanling Sect with a lotus blooming at every step they took.

The Giant Rock Canyon was quite some distance away from Xuanling Sect. Sects would allocate horses and carriages for disciples to use when they were out on a mission.

Gu Yanqiu had already reported about the mission; hence, when they descended from the Path to Heaven, they saw ten horses at the peak of the mountain, and everyone sat on a horse each. After entering the sect, they were required to wear the sect uniform when leaving for missions. Amongst the ten people, there was only one girl, Ye Qingtang. The other nine people were elegant and talented young man with full energy and extraordinary disposition. Taking a look at the ten people on horses, it was like a brilliant scenery.

And so, they began their journey for the rewarded mission.
