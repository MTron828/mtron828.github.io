Chapter 903 It’s You Whom I Am Hitting (5)

Feng Wuya laughed coldly.

“No matter whether you agree or not, it’s not for you to decide!”

Then, Feng Wuya told the group of Divine Virtual Academy disciples. “You all, capture this slut for me immediately. Break her limbs if she resists. Just leave her with a last breath.”

After hearing Feng Wuya’s words, the Divine Virtual Academy people nodded and walked towards Ye Qingtang with great strides.

Upon noticing the situation, there were no emotions on Ye Qingtang’s face, much less any signs of fear.

Although Ye Qingtang had not yet absorbed the inheritance of the Heavenly Demon, the divine power of the Heavenly Demon Pearl could still be used temporarily. If the power of the Heavenly Demon could be transferred out, she would not be able to defeat them, but she could flee this place alone without being caught by anyone.

However, at this instant, two disciples from the Divine Virtual Academy suddenly rushed out and stopped the leader.

“Senior Brother, you cannot… cannot attack…” the two disciples said frantically.

“Why? Why can’t I attack?” The leader of the Divine Virtual Academy disciples frowned.

“Senior Brother… this lady… is a Supreme Academy student from a few batches ago and was an insanely-talented student…” That Divine Virtual Academy disciple explained hurriedly.

“So what if she was an insanely-talented disciple from a few batches ago?” The leader scoffed coldly and did not put it to heart.

So many of them were here. Would they still be afraid of an insanely-talented disciple from the Supreme Academy?

“Senior Brother, do you know Perfected Gu Yun?” that disciple said.

“Of course I do. Ling Yan’s teacher, a powerful figure at the Divine Arcane Supremacy level.” The leader nodded.

Immediately, those two Divine Virtual Academy disciples exchanged a look and said rather bitterly, “This lady… killed Perfected Gu Yun… with just one strike…”

“What did you say?!”

The moment he finished his sentence, everyone from Divine Virtual Academy and Supreme Academy was filled with shock.

They were naturally aware of Perfected Gu Yun’s skills.

But what was unbelievable to them was that… this lady actually killed Perfected Gu Yun, a Divine Arcane Supremacy, with one strike?!

Since the spirit energy on this mainland was insufficient, Perfected Gu Yun’s martial realm was severely suppressed as a Divine Arcane Supremacy. Despite so, he was not someone they could contend against.

To be able to kill Perfected Gu Yun with one strike, didn’t that mean in the Central Mainland, this lady was even more powerful than Perfected Gu Yun?!

To them, Perfected Gu Yun was was already a highly Divine Arcane Supremacy, yet this lady could kill him with a strike. What kind of existence was this lady?!

A Divine Arcane Supremacy at her peak or… a realm above the Arcane Supremacy, a Heavenly Venerate?!

Regardless of whether she was a Heavenly Venerate or a Divine Arcane Supremacy at her peak, she was considered an extremely powerful figure in the Central Mainland, especially if she was a Heavenly Venerate.

A saying once circulated in the Central Mainland.

Anyone beneath a Venerate… was nothing but an ant!

In the Central Mainland, a Virtual Arcane Supremacy was not anything as there was still a Divine Arcane Supremacy above it.

But above the Divine Arcane Supremacy, there was still the Heavenly Venerate!

It was already extremely difficult for cultivators to enter the Heavenly Venerate realm. To many, a Heavenly Venerate represented an unparalleled figure and was a legend.

At this instant, the Supreme Academy side watched on agape as well. Three batches before—what kind of concept was that?!

“Senior Brother Li Xiu, this is Ye Qingtang, Senior Sister Ye. She is three batches before us!” Feng Wudang struggled up and looked at Li Xiu and the rest.
