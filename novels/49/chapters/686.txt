Chapter 687: Yuan Returning Stone (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

In the Nine Nights Dynasty, the number of forces which possessed spirit animals was not a small number either.

It was said that the Falling Sky Valley in the Nine Nights Dynasty had a big black dog that could speak, and it was also one of the few spirit animals that existed.

Another example was the Ouyang family clan, the number one family clan in the Nine Nights Dynasty, which possessed a Golden Crow that could speak.

“Brother, is this little yellow dragon a spirit animal… Where did you get it from? Are you interested to make a deal?” A rather skilled cultivator asked Ye Qingtang.

“I’m not selling,” Ye Qingtang said.

After hearing that, that cultivator saw that Ye Qingtang was foreign-looking and did not seem to be someone from a big force from the Nine Nights Dynasty. “Little brother, I’m Zhou Fu, a member of the Zhou family clan in the Nine Nights Dynasty. Are you sure you’re unwilling to make this deal with me?”

Ye Qingtang heard something about the Zhou family clan in her previous life as well.

It was a second-tier force in the Nine Nights Dynasty and was about the same as Xuanling Sect and Wind Moon Sect in the Formidable Heavens Dynasty.

“F*ck you. What do you treat me as? Am I someone you can buy just because you want to?!” The little white tiger glared at Zhou Fu and shouted angrily.

A trace of fury appeared on Zhou Fu’s face when he heard the spirit animal scolding him. “I’m talking to your owner. Was it ever your turn to speak?”

…

Ye Qingtang looked at Zhou Fu coldly. “What my spirit animal said is what I want to say.”

“What did you say?!” Zhou Fu’s eyes flickered.

Ye Qingtang looked away from Zhou Fu, ignoring his desires, and spoke to her little white tiger. “You’re interested in the Yuan Returning Stone?”

“Yes. The Yuan Returning Stone contains the Heaven and Earth energy. It is useless to human cultivators, but it’s extremely useful to me!” The little white tiger nodded repeatedly as its big, round eyes were filled with longing.

“Since you have a request, I’ll help you to obtain it.” Ye Qingtang smiled faintly. Her eyes were icy as she swept a look at the arrogant Shangguan Rui discreetly.

Then, Ye Qingtang walked towards the slave master in great strides.

At that instant, Shangguan Rui looked at the blue-haired girl with interest. “Truly a supreme-grade… How nice-smelling…”

Shangguan Rui lifted the girl’s blue hair to near his nose and reveled in its smell.

“Quick… Give me the knife… Faster…” Shangguan Rui could not contain his excitement and said to that indifferent guard.

Very quickly, the guard took a long knife out and handed it to Shangguan Rui.

“I’m begging you… Let me go…” As though she felt death approaching her, fear was etched on the blue-haired girl’s face when she saw Shangguan Rui walking towards her with a long knife in hand

The brutality and terror of Shangguan Rui skinning someone alive earlier on were still vivid in her mind.

“Haha…” Shangguan Rui laughed. “Don’t fail to appreciate my favor. Being able to be hung in my Beauty Pavilion… is an honor of your many lifetimes…”

After saying that, the long knife in his hands moved, about to stab into the blue-haired girl’s body.

“I want this woman.”

At that moment, Ye Qingtang’s indifferent voice echoed around the place.

Everyone was stunned to hear that and looked around the crowd instinctively.

A beautiful young man in white slowly walked out with a feather fan in his hand.

“Another person courting death?!”

“Tsk tsk. There are really quite a few people courting death today.”

When they saw that a beautiful young man wanted to snatch the blue-haired girl with Shangguan Rui, everyone laughed coldly as they waited for a good show.

Zhou Fu scoffed. It seemed that he did not need to take any action anymore. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Then, Shangguan Rui placed the long knife down and inspected Ye Qingtang with interest.
