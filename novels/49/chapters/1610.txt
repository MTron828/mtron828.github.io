Chapter 1611: Don’t Move If You’re Scared (2)

“What the hell is the Supreme League Kingdom doing? Sending this little devil out to die?”

“Could they be surrendering?”

The allied forces roared with laughter. They found the scene before them hilarious.

The knights of the Glorious Lions swept a patronizing look at Ye Qingtang. They crossed their arms and said to the troop next to them, “Don’t waste time. Kill her.”

No matter what the Supreme League Kingdom had up its sleeve, they had no time to waste on this girl. Their goal was to capture the Supreme League Kingdom’s fortress.

With that, a hundred allied soldiers rode out, yelling as they charged at Ye Qingtang.

They carried long spears and spurred their horses as they galloped forward swiftly.

Ye Qingtang’s face remained expressionless when she saw the approaching cavalry. She dismounted to meet the allied forces that were galloping towards her.

The ten thousand Supreme League Kingdom soldiers who were standing outside the fortress watched as the hundred riders charged at Ye Qingtang. The spear points glittered with cold light. At the next moment, they would pierce Ye Qingtang’s frail body. Everyone subconsciously shut their eyes.

“Do you want to die?” The allied forces were right in front of Ye Qingtang. The dozens of cavalry lifted their spears in unison and threw them forcefully at Ye Qingtang!

Clank clank clank clank...

The spear points made contact with Ye Qingtang without harming her. It was as if all the spears had hit tough meteoric iron, and a clear ringing sound could be heard.

Ye Qingtang stood there without moving an inch. It was as if the sharp spears pinned to her body were dozens of feathers.

“What... what’s going on?” The allied forces’ troops were stunned. They looked at the spears in their hands and thrust them forward with all their might, but they could not penetrate Ye Qingtang’s skin at all.

It was as if they had hit a rock.

At that moment, even the Supreme League Kingdom soldiers, who could not bear to watch what would have been a gruesome death, were completely shocked, not to mention the allied forces. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

They saw dozens of spears thrust at Ye Qingtang, yet why... did Ye Qingtang seem completely unharmed?

On the city wall, Joseph and the other Kingdom Knight were also shaken by this sight.

“Is Tang wearing armor?”

“Nonsense! What kind of armor can withstand the spears of the Glorious Lion knights?”

The spears of the Glorious Lion Knights were all specially forged. It was no exaggeration to say that they could cut through metal like paper. They could even easily cut through a thick steel plate.

Could this Ye Qingtang’s body be harder than a steel plate?

While everyone was in a state of shock, Ye Qingtang calmly glanced at the dozens of spearheads pressing against her.

The next moment, she suddenly lifted her hand and swept at the spears.

A metallic explosion instantly rang out. The specially forged spears all broke and clattered to the ground as she waved her sleeve!

Before the allied forces could recover their wits, Ye Qingtang had already strode forward. Her slender hands batted at an allied soldier in the front as if shooing a fly away.

“Ah Ah!!”

The moment Ye Qingtang’s hands swept past, a wail rang out.

Ye Qingtang had sent the allied soldier and his horse flying!

The other allied soldiers had no time to react before Ye Qingtang slowly walked over to them. As her slender arm rose and fell, all the surrounding allied soldiers and their horses were sent flying!
