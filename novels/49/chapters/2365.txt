Chapter 2366: Regulations (3)

Realization dawned upon Ye Qingtang. No wonder she found the atmosphere somewhat strange. The others in this hall all looked down upon the Netherworld Academy.

From his position beside her, Wen Qi gradually explained the true circumstances of the Inter-Academy Competition. In all honesty, he felt rather conflicted as he looked at Ye Qing.

It was clear that he already admired Ye Qing when he first heard of the youth’s unique understanding of martial arts. Ye Qing had only brought him even more major surprises.

It was such a pity…

Wen Qi couldn’t help giving an inward sigh.

Ye Qing was still too young and had only spent a short time at the Netherworld Academy. If he could remain at the Netherworld Academy for a decade, with his understanding of martial arts and alchemy skills, he might be able to inject fresh blood into the academy.

Such a pity…

Wen Qi knew that Wu Fengling let Ye Qing come to the Inter-Academy Competition because he already had thoughts of giving up on this year’s competition. Wen Qi himself harbored the same thoughts.

Although Ran Mo and Qin Feng were pretty good, it was still not good enough to rise above the competition in Universe City.

So he had allowed Ye Qing to participate this time just to let him have a better understanding of the Inter-Academy Competition, and to groom him for the future, in hopes that he could produce more talented students for the next competition.

Even if they had to start all over again, at least they would have a chance.

But Wen Qi would never reveal this point to anyone. He could not batter the confidence of the teachers and students right before the competition.

Very soon, the elders in charge of the Inter-Academy Competition arrived and explained to everyone the changes in the rules.

Actually, there weren’t many changes. The one-on-one competitions for martial arts and alchemy remained unchanged. They would still choose the top 10. The only change was to the team competition…

“For this team competition, we will have 10 participants in a group, to be led by a teacher…”

“President Wu’s information was indeed accurate. There are substantial changes to the team competition. 10 to a team and only the top team will be chosen… tsk, so sad.” Luo Sheng frowned slightly.

The team competition was the main event of the Inter-Academy Competition. If victorious, they could win 10 spots all at once. There was no better way.

However, the competition was also more intense. The various academies would definitely send out all their top elites. But in the end, only one team would win.

The Cold Cloud Academy elder who was talking to Zhan Yunzhou earlier spoke up. “Where is the location of this year’s competition?”

In the previous Inter-Academy competition, there was also a team competition, but the top three teams had been chosen. In contrast, for this year, only the top team would earn a spot. Moreover, they allowed a teacher to lead the team. This was a major change.

To allow a teacher to directly participate in a competition, it would definitely be no simple trial.

The elder replied, “The location will be the Wailing Well.”

Everyone’s faces changed at his words!

“The Wailing Well? Isn’t that place surrounded by an evil aura, such that no one is able to enter?” Someone asked in a puzzled tone. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The elder nodded.

“Several months ago, the Wailing Well’s evil aura was dispelled.”

The crowd exchanged looks, grave expressions mirrored across all their faces.

“Vice-President, the Wailing Well you are referring to is the one situated in the Evil Marsh in the outskirts of Universe City?” One of the teachers asked in a low voice.

Wen Qi nodded.
