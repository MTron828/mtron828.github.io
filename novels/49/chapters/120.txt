Chapter 121: Assessment Results (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“What is going on?” The Herbal Faction Elder was a little dumbfounded.

This white corundum was extremely hard, how could it crack just like this?

The other elders also had a look of confusion.

Only the Fist Faction Elder seemed to have thought of something, as he suddenly stood up and said, “Invisible Force! Ye Qingtang actually knows the Invisible Force technique?”

The Invisible Force was one of the more profound fist techniques amongst all the fist arts and was similar to the “Hitting the Cattle From Across the Mountain” technique. However, it was very difficult to see anything strange when one punched. This type of fist technique would not bring any damage to the object being punched, but the fist’s force will be transferred backward from the first object that was hit. If there were no objects or living beings backing the first object from behind, then the punch would directly crush the core of the first object.

Previously, the Fist Faction elder thought that Ye Qingtang really did not know any fist arts and did not use enough force, which was why there was no trace of damage on the Invasive Stone.

Seeing things now, however, he had thought wrong.

On usual assessments, there was a certain distance between the Invasive Stone and the White Corundum, but this time, he specially ordered his disciples to stick the Invasive Stone against the White Corundum without leaving any gap before the third segment started in order prevent an accident similar to that in the sword array from happening.

Which also meant,

If it was on a normal day, Ye Qingtang’s punch would definitely crush the entire Invasive Stone from the inside. Unexpectedly, the slight adjustment made by the Fist Faction Elder made the white corundum pillar bear all the force from Ye Qingtang’s punch.

At that moment…

The Fist Faction Elder’s expression changed rapidly.

Under the constant questioning of other elders, he said the reason.

After the elders’ heard the explanation, the smile on Elder Lin’s face fell apart while a smile slowly formed on Elder Qin’s face.

“I really did not expect Ye Qingtang to have such abilities,” Elder Qin praised Ye Qingtang openly with no intention of concealing it.

The Fist Faction Elder laughed bitterly as well. “This Invisible Force technique does not use the spirit root’s power, and it can amplify one’s force to the extreme. It is indeed very suitable for her to use, however… it is difficult to train, and there would be barely any success with less than ten years of training… Ye Qingtang is only fifteen. Could it be that she started training the Invisible Force technique ever since she was five years old?”

Guesses filled the few elders’ minds as they saw Ye Qingtang’s stunning performance.

“It could be. Previously when the grade of Ye Qingtang’s spirit root was revealed, I thought it was strange. Mu Su knows the sect’s rules, and if he really recommended a red spirit root person here, it might not be a good thing for him. After all, we will only give once chance for assessment. If the person Mu Su recommended doesn’t pass the assessment, it will not look good on him as well.” Elder Qin thought for a while and continued.

“It must be that Ye Qingtang knows her spirit root is not good enough and, thus, painstakingly trained other things. Mu Su realized this and made an exception to recommend her to our sect.”

All the elders found Elder Qin’s words logical.

However…

They would need to make a change to the issue that they discussed a while ago.

“Ye Qingtang ranked first in all three segments of the assessment. Even if she has a red spirit root, we should still give a chance to such a skilled youth like her.”

The Fist Faction Elder was also in approval of Ye Qingtang’s mastery of the Invisible Force technique and, naturally, did not object.

Similarly, the Herbal Faction Elder was amiable and did not object.

The only elder who had not expressed his view was Elder Lin, who had always been on opposing ends with Elder Qin.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com
