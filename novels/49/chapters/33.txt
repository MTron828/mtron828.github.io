Chapter 34: Fire Venom (4)

Dr. Xu was just about to come forward, when Si Ye’s large stature cut in directly in front of the bed. With a tight grip, he locked Ye Qingtang’s hand that tried to remove the bandages.

“You know the wound on his chest is deep. What’re you trying to pull off by removing those bandages now?” Si Ye asked in a coldly contemptuous voice.

Ye Qingtang looked straight into the eyes of Si Ye, that glared at her like a beast staking its prey, and with a smile that played on her lips, she plainly stated: “If you want your brother to continue with his suffering, feel free to take your time.”

Si Ye scowled at her, in a fury that engulfed him with fierce momentum.

“Lord Si Ye, Miss Ye’s well-versed in the medical field. If she’s willing to handle this personally, I’m sure she must be pretty assured of its success. Why not let her give it a go?” Dr. Xu tried to convince him as well.

“If she must try, Dr. Xu, you should be the performing physician. She’s still much too young for this.” Si Ye continued to glare at Ye Qingtang. Needless to say, regardless of her age, as long as she was from the Ye household, Si Ye would not give in.

Si Bai was growing a headache as he watched from the sidelines. His grandfather and eldest brother were like two peas in a pod, stubborn as a mule.

Si Bai was just about to coax Si Ye into stepping aside, when Ye Qingtang suddenly flipped her slender hand within Si Ye’s clutch, shifting into a firm grip over his hand instead. Before Si Ye could even react, she raised a foot next and kicked him directly in his side!

Si Ye could never expect a girl like her to start a fight without warning, moreover her moves were at lightning speed!

A loud ‘crack’ resounded within the room.

Ye Qingtang had dislocated Si Ye’s arm with that single kick….

“I’m trying to save a life now, stop wasting my time.” Ye Qingtang tossed Si Ye out of the room and as she began removing the bandages, she told Si Bai: “Keep an eye on your big brother while I’m busy here!”

Si Bai could neither laugh nor cry at the situation, but he rushed forward nonetheless, and held Si Ye back, who had erupted into a frenzy.

“Bro, just let her try, I’ll make the assurance.”

“You idiot!” To prevent hurting Si Bai should he retaliate, Si Ye could only glare at Ye Qingtang, while he endured the excruciating pain from his dislocated arm.

He could not understand what’s wrong with his family, placing their trust on someone from the Ye household!

Ye Qingtang removed the bandages swiftly without faltering. Beneath those bandages, a repulsive wound was exposed, accentuated by the burned skin overlapping it. Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes and drew a dagger from her waist. With a swing of her arm, the dagger flashed across the wound, drawing a bloody seam!

Everyone else within the room had the shock of their lives when they witnessed her act.

Si Bai had never expected Ye Qingtang to reveal such a hand. He loosened his restraint on Si Ye instinctively.

Si Ye, after witnessing his brother being slashed in the chest, stormed forward like a vicious beast, set loose to tear Ye Qingtang apart.

But….

Once Dr. Xu saw Ye Qingtang raising a porcelain bottle next and emptying its contents, which were like crimson sawdust, into the open wound, he rushed forward as well and blocked Si Ye in his way.

“Lord Si Ye! Wait! Miss Ye’s applying the Ifrit’s scales directly into the wound. This will no doubt, suppress the venom in the body!” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Ifrit’s scales?” When Si Ye heard Dr. Xu’s words, he was clearly stunned for a moment.

“It’s my ignorance. To think there’s really a way to grind those scales into powder. Miss Ye’s truly amazing.” Dr. Xu was totally flabbergasted. Despite her young age, Ye Qingtang who was capable of medical feats had time and again, impressed the experienced and prestigious physician.
