Chapter 1667: A Bet (2)

“Who has the time to scold you? I’m scolding the lunatic. Does Miss Mu think she is the lunatic?” Jiang Yiran raised his brow fearlessly.

Mu Ruxue quivered with rage at his insolence.

Jiang Yiran felt even better when he saw Mu Ruxue’s livid expression. He spoke again, “Everyone can vote as they please in the beauty rankings. I think our family’s Qingtang is gorgeous. What business is it of yours if I vote for her? Do you have a problem if I think she’s the prettiest?”

Do you think you’re very beautiful?

Let’s see if you’re prettier than the little girl.

Ye Qingtang, who had been targeted out of the blue, “...”

She had made a mistake. She should have kicked Jiang Yiran down the stairs long ago. Then he would not be here, making enemies for her like a crazy person.

Ye Qingtang looked at Mu Ruxue’s livid face and the startled glances of the diners. She wondered if Jiang Yiran was trying to kill two birds with one stone. Like this, he would pay Mu Ruxue back and also annoy her at the same time...

“Who is she to compete with me?” Mu Ruxue laughed coldly.

“Ye Qingtang, “...”

Yes, yes, yes, you are the most beautiful person in the world. You’re so amazingly beautiful, alright?

“Ah, you’re so funny. In what way is our Tang Tang unfit to compete with you? Your looks are far inferior to that of our Tang Tang. Do you want to top the beauty ranking? Do you want to be the most beautiful girl in the Martial Arts Championship? Dream on. Wait and see. On the last day, the most beautiful girl will be our Tang Tang.” Mu Ruxue had almost blinded Jiang Yiran. He certainly would not forgive her for that.

Even if he could not beat Mu Ruxue, he would annoy her to death!

Mu Ruxue had clearly become Jiang Yiran’s number one enemy. Ye Qingtang broke out in goosebumps as he repeatedly called her ‘Tang Tang’.

Jiang Shaobai was sitting nearby and his expression also darkened. If circumstances had permitted, Ye Qingtang would have struck Jiang Yiran down with a sword. This devil was making trouble.

“Ah...” Mu Ruxue was so angry that she laughed instead. “I have never been afraid to compete with someone based on looks.”

Mu Ruxue looked at Ye Qingtang and she proudly raised her chin in provocation. “Ye Qingtang? We’ll wait and see who tops the beauty ranking on the last day.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Then let’s see. I’m just afraid you won’t be able to compete.” Jiang Yiran replied with vim. “What happens if you lose?”

“If I lose, I will publicly disfigure myself and be ugly for the rest of my life,” Mu Ruxue snapped out in spite.

If anything, Jiang Yiran was even more delighted with her declaration. “Alright!”

“Then if she loses, she must do the same.” Mu Ruxue pointed at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang was about to refuse this ridiculous bet, but Jiang Yiran answered first. “No problem.”

“Oh? Who is so brave as to make this kind of bet with Ruxue?” An amused voice suddenly rang out.

Everyone turned towards the sound. At some point, Baili Xuanyun had appeared in the restaurant, and Mu Feiruo was standing next to him.

Everyone was stunned.

Mu Ruxue grew even more furious when she saw Baili Xuanyun and Mu Feiruo. She pointed to Ye Qingtang, who had been silent all this time and spat out, “Her.”

“...” Ye Qingtang felt that if she kept quiet any longer, Jiang Yiran would get her into even worse trouble. So she said, “I’m not interested in this bet, and I also have no interest in the beauty rankings.”

You’re the most beautiful person in the world alright? She had no interest in comparing herself with others.
