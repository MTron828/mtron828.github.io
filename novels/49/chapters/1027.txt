Chapter 1028 Undermining The Foundation (3)

Before the two YunXiao Sect elders could speak, the youths’ martial force shot skywards and seemed to disperse the clouds in the sky.

These forces belonging to half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lords spilled forth together like a flood and gathered together like a rushing river. The shocking martial force caused everyone to shudder.

The two Yunxiao Sect elders were shocked when they sensed the force of several other half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lords. They had not expected the Ye Family to have as many as four or five half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lords!

Just as Elder Yin and Elder Gu were in shock…

“What’s the matter? You think highly of those half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lords but are disdainful of us. Since when has the Yunxiao Sect become so greedy?!” The remaining hundred-plus Ye Family disciples immediately spoke up.

“Brothers and sisters, let us show these two lofty Yunxiao Sect elders if we are worthy to enter their Yunxiao Sect to cultivate.” One of the slightly older Ye Family disciples glanced at everyone and spoke.

“My thoughts exactly.”

“Haha… I resent being looked down on by the Yunxiao Sect.”

“It is merely the Yunxiao Sect, but it has become so greedy that it dares to come to our Ye House and make trouble…’

“Let’s show them whether we Ye Family disciples are worthy of being noticed by the YunXiao Sect!”

As they spoke, over a hundred martial forces were simultaneously produced by the hundred Ye Family disciples. Like a formless gust of air, it swept the area within a radius of ten miles.

Among the hundred over martial forces, the weakest of them had already entered the realm of Martial Qi Level Three while the strongest was one step away from transforming into a Yin Yang Perfected Lord.

This force seemed to fill the heavens, the earth, the seas, and the mountains. Even every corner of the world seemed to be permeated with it.

It was like the raging of ocean waves or like the tremors of a mountain quaking; like the heavens being rent or like the earth collapsing.

The integration of a hundred-plus martial forces was terrifying, especially the explosion that followed its coalition, which extended for a radius of ten miles. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

At the same time, everyone from the Si Family and the three branches of the Ye Family also sensed it.

The Master of the Si Family did not know what had happened in the Ye House. However, he unhesitatingly led the powerful cultivators in his family straight to the Ye House.

The three branches of the Ye Family and the three powerful Yin Yang Perfected Lords led the senior members and talented youths of the branches and also hurried to the Ye Family headquarters in unison.

At that moment in the Ye Family’s headquarters, the two Yunxiao Sect elders who, in the midst of these waves of forces, were like lone boats adrift on a raging sea.

“What’s going on?!”

Ye Ling and Second Elder rapidly sensed this frightening force and appeared at the same time, bewildered.

They thought that the talented disciples had been sparring and making mischief and that they had caused trouble. However, when they arrived, things did not seem to be what they had imagined

“Greetings, Master and Elders.”

When they saw that Ye Ling and a few elders had appeared, the Ye Family disciples in the courtyard withdrew their martial force and spoke respectfully.

“Who are they?” The Great Elder asked when he looked at the two Yunxiao Sect elders and saw that they were strangers.

“Great Elder, these two are YunXiao Sect elders.” Ye Leng laughed.

“What… Yunxiao Sect?!”
