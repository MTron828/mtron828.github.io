Chapter 945 We Meet Again (3)

“But the conclusion would be the same. The Heavenly Demon Pearl has the aura of the original Heavenly Demon. The moment the girl acted against Ye Qingtang, her Devouring Bloodline would be seized by the power of the Heavenly Demon Pearl. The conclusion would be the same, regardless of the outcome.” Little azure dragon finished slowly.

“Ling Yan, what a great scheme… but what if there was someone else with the Phoenix Bloodline among the cultivators who came to the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix, and he was chosen by the Divine Phoenix? Then, the successor would be neither Ye Qingtang nor the girl in green. Wouldn’t your scheme fall through?” The little white tiger was not convinced.

“That is impossible because Ling Yan already checked, and no one else possessed the Phoenix Bloodline. Even if they did, it would be an inferior Phoenix Bloodline, and the Divine Phoenix would not choose him. Even a superior Phoenix Bloodline would be inferior to Ye Qingtang and the girl,” explained the little azure dragon.

“F*ck you, you’re vicious. You win.” The little white tiger grunted coldly.

Ever since he had entered the Dragon Vein, everything this Ling Yan had done was seemingly unrelated. But in reality, when he strung them together, they formed an interlocking chain that one could not guard against.

Ever since Ye Qingtang had blocked the knife, it had been one grand, shocking scheme.

Further, the chain reaction caused by the knife included killing Perfected Gu Yun, obtaining the Heavenly Demon Pearl, making everyone believe Ye Qingtang was a cultivator from the Jiang family, and finally the power of the Heavenly Demon Pearl seizing the Devouring Bloodline and so on…

This kind of person was just too horrifying… with all kinds of evil plots and benign schemes. Even if one knew it was a trap, one had no choice but to grit one’s teeth and jump in.

“What the f*ck… that’s not right, Ling Yan!” The little white tiger suddenly looked at Ling Yan.

“If you didn’t give the Heavenly Demon Pearl to Ye Qingtang but personally came to the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix and provoked the girl into fighting you, you could have used the power of the Heavenly Demon Pearl and seized the girl’s Devouring Bloodline yourself… if you had the Devouring Bloodline, coupled with your schemes, you would definitely be comparable with the true god within a few years. But you gave the Heavenly Demon Pearl to Ye Qingtang instead… Why was that?”

Even Ye Qingtang herself could not understand, much less the little white tiger.

Ling Yan could predict everything down to the last detail. Based on his intelligence, it would be only too easy to gain power.

Why would he give her all these opportunities?

When he heard that, Ling Yan smiled and said, “I felt that Miss Ye needed the Devouring Bloodline more than I did. Miss Ye’s calamity is probably greater than mine. Also, although I may have lost the opportunity to become comparable with the true god, Miss Ye can protect me in the future, isn’t it?”

As he spoke, Ling Yan’s smiling gaze seemed to fall on Ye Qingtang.

“…” Ye Qingtang was speechless.

“Pfft!” Little white tiger scoffed. “I’ll never believe that you need anyone to protect you.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“You’re being stupid.” The little azure dragon glared at the little white tiger. “He is worried about Ye Qingtang’s safety. After possessing the Devouring Bloodline, Ye Qingtang can become more powerful. He would rather forgo his chance to become comparable to the true god. Do you understand?”

“Oh… I understand.” The little white tiger studied Ye Qingtang meaningfully.

However, without giving Ye Qingtang a chance to speak, Ling Yan laughed and said, “Miss Ye, you had better leave this mainland as soon as possible.”

“Why?” Ye Qingtang was perplexed.

“Because…” Ling Yan smiled. “I am going to destroy this mainland with the power of the True Dragon.”

“What did you say…”

Ye Qingtang frowned deeply after hearing Ling Yan’s words.

Was this Ling Yan actually going to use the power of the True Dragon to destroy this mainland?!
