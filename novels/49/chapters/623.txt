Chapter 624: A Secret Hidden From The World (2)

“Let me tell you a story,” the little white tiger said mysteriously. “A very very long time ago, the Fourth Domain appeared out of nowhere and became the strongest domain in this world. Countless of extremely powerful figures headed for it in adoration, but most of them could not find out how to get there. Only a few people entered the Fourth Domain by coincidence… And those ancient powerful figures who entered the Fourth Domain never came out after that… There was once a rumor that the Fourth Domain was the domain of death where strangers were prohibited from being anywhere near it. There was also another rumor that the Fourth Domain possessed the most advanced martial culture… When the Perfected Immortals and Ancient Buddhas disappeared in a night, no matter how many powerful figures chased after the traces of the predecessors and tried to find out the location of the Fourth Domain…”

“So… what has the Fourth Domain got to do with this mainland?” Ye Qingtang was confused, unclear of what the little white tiger wanted to say.

“Young man, haste makes waste. Listen to me slowly.” The little white tiger continued talking. “From ancient times till now, there was only… one extraordinary lady who truly entered and left the Fourth Domain alive. It is said that she possessed the bloodlines of ancient Buddhas and Perfected Immortals. Thus… she could find the Fourth Domain and leave it safely… After that extraordinary lady left the Fourth Domain, she sealed everything she saw in the Fourth Domain in her Spiritual Abode. Eventually, after that genius lady died, her Spiritual Abode turned into this Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm…”

After hearing the little white tiger’s words, Ye Qingtang was in deep thought.

That lady who possessed the bloodlines of ancient Buddhas and Perfected Immortals should be the powerful figure whom the Xuanling Patriarch saved back then… Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“But do you know that actually, this mainland that we are in right now is also formed by that lady…” The little white tiger would not stop saying anything shocking.

“What did you say?!” Shock flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes. She was in disbelief.

The mainland that she grew up in was actually formed by a powerful figure’s Spiritual Abode. How could this be?

The little white tiger looked at Ye Qingtang with an expression that read “I knew you would be like this” and said, “When that extraordinary lady came here, this mainland was only a deserted area. It did not have any martial culture, and order was absent. Everything seemed to be stuck in the primitive era. After seeing it, the extraordinary lady took pity and thus used her Spiritual Abode to turn into this entire mainland and led those human clans to slowly learn about the martial dao…”

“What happened afterward?” Ye Qingtang asked again.

“Afterward?” The little white tiger scoffed coldly. “That extraordinary lady used her powers to create this mainland and taught the humans on this mainland to use the martial dao. Initially, those humans were deeply grateful, but as the powers of that extraordinary lady thinned, the humans were gradually dissatisfied with the genius lady. They complained about her and even got furious… Ultimately, they actually joined forces to severely injure that genius lady and sucked all the last traces of powers in her body dry. Afterward, the extraordinary lady who was on the edge of death was saved by the Xuanling Patriarch but died a few days later.”

“What you mean is that that extraordinary lady had two Spiritual Abodes in her body?” Ye Qingtang asked in curiosity.

“That’s right. It’s said that the extraordinary lady is the descendant of an ancient Buddha and Perfected Immortal. She possessed the bloodlines of both Immortals and Buddhas and was extremely powerful. She possessed two Spiritual Abodes. One of them created this mainland while the other turned into this mystic realm.” The little white tiger nodded.

“That extraordinary lady is truly foolish.” Ye Qingtang could not help but sigh.
