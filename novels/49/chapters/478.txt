“Oh… is it?” Ye Qingtang had no fear when facing Ning Luo.

Ye Qingtang was about to strike a move, but a figure suddenly stood before her.

Qin Huan did not know who the Ye You Ning Luo mentioned was but immediately blocked in front of Ye Qingtang when he saw that Ning Luo was about to harm Ye Qingtang. “Junior Sister Ye, escape now. I’ll help to stall this betrayer!”

Ye Qingtang thought to herself,?… What the heck!

“Can you… move away first?” Ye Qingtang asked with a frown.

“Junior Sister Ye, ignore us and leave. Ning Luo is too strong, and we can’t hold him any longer even with combined forces!” Qin Huan said hurriedly as he saw that Ning Luo wanted to kill Ye Qingtang.

“Move away!”

Ye Qingtang lifted her foot and kicked Qin Huan to a side.

Her words fell on deaf ears, and she was forced to be violent.

“Junior Sister Ye, what are you…” Qin Huan was appalled. Why did she kick him for nothing?

However, before Qin Huan finished his sentence, he noticed that Ye Qingtang had already disappeared with only a slight trace of her shadow at the original spot.

Clank!

Ye Qingtang drew the Demonic Blood Sword out of its scabbard and slashed down fiercely.

Swoosh!

Immediately, the Demonic Blood Sword was like an enormous beast that wanted to devour Ning Luo.

Ning Luo’s smile froze, and a disbelieving shock twinkled in his eyes as he felt Ye Qingtang’s aura from that one move.

He still remembered that Ye Qingtang had just entered Xuanling Sect, and it had only been a while since she passed the inner sect assessment.

The top inner sect disciples in Xuanling Sect were only at the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two, but Ye Qingtang was already at the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two?!

Ning Luo swept the shocked expression in his eyes away rapidly. No matter what miracle this girl encountered, she was, after all, at Martial Qi Level Two, and it would only take a moment for him to kill her.

However…

Ning Luo realized he was wrong very quickly.

He almost could not block the sword aura that Ye Qingtang casually slashed towards him.

After being forced a few steps back by the Demonic Blood Sword’s sword aura, Ning Luo finally used all his strength to expel the aura.

“You…” Ning Luo narrowed his eyes at Ye Qingtang immediately, unable to comprehend what happened.

This girl was only an ordinary inner sect disciple in Xuanling Sect. How could she possess such strong skills…

Currently, even those inner sect elders of Xuanling Sect might not be Ye Qingtang’s opponent.

Qin Huan, Zhu Changge, and the other disciples were completely dumbfounded when they saw that Ye Qingtang pushed Ning Luo back a few steps with just one move.

The inner sect disciple who brought Ye Qingtang to the scene, especially, was utterly astonished. He finally understood what Ye Qingtang meant when she said she was their savior earlier on…

“Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two… Am I dreaming?” Qin Huan thought it was unrealistic as time passed.

Ye Qingtang and he were both outer sect disciples of Xuanling Sect initially. Although Ye Qingtang displayed outstanding martial gifts and placed first in the outer sect, allowing her to enter the inner sect… it was still impossible for her to break through to the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three in such a short time…

“Ha…” Ning Luo looked at Ye Qingtang at that moment and scoffed. “I was still wondering why Senior Sister Ye You wanted me to kill an ant-like Xuanling Sect disciple… So you are not an ordinary person as well. However, it is not in vain that you could make Senior Sister Ye You to be concerned about you, given your status.”

Ye You was the Holy Lady of Yunxiao Sect and a possessor of a blue spirit root.

Although the number of cultivators with green spirit roots on this mainland was not a small number, blue spirit roots were unusually rare, and there was hardly one out of a million people.
