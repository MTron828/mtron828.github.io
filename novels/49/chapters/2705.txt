Chapter 2706: Battle For The Heavenly Dao (1)

Ye Qingtang stared at the black shadow in the sky. As she did, a strange feeling surged in her heart.

“How strange…” Ye Qingtang pondered. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Every time she tried to size up the black shadow, she would feel somewhat dazed. It was clearly just a memory. Why would she have such a strange feeling?

“Let’s stop this pointless conversation.” The black shadow chuckled.

As the black shadow spoke, he waved his right hand and endless black flames engulfed the entire capital.

“What terrifying flames…”

Lan Shan and the others were shocked and filled with disbelief.

The divine might of these flames could probably turn top-notch Immortal Emperors into ash. Even their divine souls would not be able to escape.

In the blink of an eye, the entire capital turned to dust in the flames. The flames were burning too quickly for anyone to react.

Furthermore, the Heaven-Devouring Beast spewed a violent wind from its mouth, accelerating the spread of the flames.

This time, the people in the capital did not even have the chance to cry out before they were reduced to dust.

The Silver Star Holy Lord transformed into a white holy light and charged into the sky.

“Clang!”

The sound of a sword being unsheathed rang out.

Everyone saw the silver star flickering between the Silver Star Holy Lord’s brows.

Swoosh!

As the sword slashed down, the Heaven-Devouring Beast’s body turned into countless fragments in front of everyone’s eyes. Blood rained down like a storm.

The Silver Star Holy Lord sheathed his sword and returned.

“This…!”

This scene stunned the Great Immortal Temple disciples. How powerful and terrifying this Silver Star Holy Lord was!

Ye Qingtang finally tore her gaze from the black shadow. The longer she stared at the black shadow, the more dazed Ye Qingtang became.

“Junior Sister Ye Yue, what… what’s wrong with you?”

Lan Shan asked Ye Qingtang in surprise.

Ye Qingtang shook her head and replied, “Nothing. I was just feeling a little uncomfortable.”

The disciples looked at Ye Qingtang’s glabella.

“Junior Sister Ye Yue, your glabella… is glowing,” Wan Rong said.

Ye Qingtang was taken aback.

“Senior Sister Ye’s glabella is glowing red…”

“Wait, this is… the mark of Heaven’s Will?” Zhang Chi stared at Ye Qingtang’s glabella in surprise.

“Heaven’s Will?” Lan Shan looked at Zhang Chi in confusion.

“Correct, the records of the Supreme Heavenly Kingdom stated that a symbol appearing between the brows that is shaped like the heavens and glowing red, it is the mark of Heaven’s Will… this is the symbol of having been chosen by the heavens.” Zhang Chi nodded.

“Chosen by the heavens for what?”

“I don’t know. It has never appeared before, nor have I ever heard of it actually happening. There is very little information about it in the records. No one knows if it is true or false.” Zhang Chi shook his head.

Ye Qingtang was shocked not because of what Zhang Chi said but because of what Ling Yan said in the past.

The Son of Destiny would be born, bringing death to all…

Ye Qingtang touched her glabella in disbelief.

She had never expected that she would be the Son of Destiny.

But… why was this happening?!

When Ye Qingtang stared at the black shadow just now, she had felt a vague discomfort between her brows but did not pay attention to it at first.
