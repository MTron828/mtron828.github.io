Chapter 2261: Treasure Trove (2)

The nose of the Night Soul Beast following behind Ye Qingtang twitched. It seemed to have detected something. But after sneaking a look at Ye Qingtang and making sure that she didn’t have any special reaction, it quietly narrowed its eyes.

After walking for a long time in the endless tunnel, a golden glow appeared somewhere toward the front. The glow was exceptionally eye-catching in the pitch-black tomb.

No matter what, it was human instinct to head towards the light. Lei Yan and the rest instinctively quickened their steps.

But everyone was stunned when they reached it!

A sea of dazzling gold greeted them.

Countless jewels piled as high as mountains. Gold and silver precious artifacts were strewn across the ground like gravel, filling up every single crook and cranny.

It was so expansive that one couldn’t see the other side. All one could see were the dazzling treasures… Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“What… what is this place?” Nangong Lie instinctively clutched his heart. He was from a major family clan and had never lacked riches. But at this very moment, he finally knew what was called a hidden treasure trove!

Mountains of gold spanning several hundred meters in height. Formed by pieces of gold piled together, with countless jewels interspersed between, sparkling and lustrous.

“Could this be… the fiendcelestial’s hidden treasures?” Even the usually-steady Jing Ze couldn’t resist gasping at the sight of these spectacular golden mountains and silver seas.

“My goodness. Is that a Dragon Saliva Jewel?” Lei Yan widened his eyes in disbelief. He saw a Dragon Saliva Jewel as big as his head nestled casually in a pile of jewels.

“Did I see correctly? If I tell my grandfather that there is a Dragon Saliva Jewel as big as my head, he will think I have gone mad.” Lei Yan held his forehead, trying to calm himself down.

Ye Qingtang was expressionless. She just continued walking, entering the sea of treasures. With every step taken, clear tinkling sounds rang out from the jewels beneath her feet. These treasures had been tossed everywhere, piled together like garbage…

It was a very tempting sight.

Ye Qingtang had once seen the Divine Phoenix’s treasure stash, and she knew just how big it was. And this treasure trove here was not at all inferior to the Divine Phoenix’s stash. In fact, it might be even bigger…

The amount of treasure here was enough to adorn every single person in any one of the mainlands in the Second Domain from head to toe…

And there would still probably be some left over.

The teenagers had never seen so much riches. They were all in a daze.

“Damn, no wonder the major factions were all so desperate to enter the fiendcelestial’s tomb. So this is the treasure they were seeking. This is really something worth going mad for…” Nangong Lie felt increasingly astounded.

The sight of all those treasures, as uncountable as the stars in the sky, truly left him dumbstruck. Even the most useless cultivator could beat those so-called powerful practitioners if he could get his hands on one of these precious artifacts.

“I say, shall we pick a few? See who dares to pick on us after we return to the academy.” Lei Yan smiled deviantly.

The ears of the other teenagers pricked up at his words. They started to look at the treasures with an appraising eye as if really trying to find something which they needed.
