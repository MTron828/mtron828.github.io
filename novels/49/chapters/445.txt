“Hahahaha!” However, Fu Lingtian crackled in disdain. “I am a Yunxiao Sect disciple. Do you all dare to lay a finger on me?!”

Yunxiao Sect?!

Elder Lin was startled. “Aren’t you a Qinglin Sect disciple? How did you become a Yunxiao Sect disciple?!”

Yunxiao Sect was at its peak and was the rich and powerful sect. Their history could even be traced to thousands of years ago. They had a deep-seated background and was not what the three sects could compare to!

“Ha…” Fu Lingtian scoffed. “There are too many things you all don’t know. In the eyes of Yunxiao Sect, you all are merely a slaughterhouse.”

“If you don’t say it clearly, you will be torn into pieces tonight.” Elder Mo ordered coldly.

“Haha. How pitiful…” Fu Lingtian shook his head and continued. “Xuanling Sect, Qinglin Sect, Wind Moon Sect… these are all slaughterhouses to feed the spirit roots of Yunxiao Sect disciples. However, what can you do even if you all know about this?”

“You’re saying that Yunxiao Sect knows a technique to swallow spirit roots?” Elder Lin seemed to be deep in thought. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Don’t b*llsh*t any longer. I advise you all to release me immediately. Otherwise, angering my Yunxiao Sect… your Xuanling Sect would definitely be exterminated!” Fu Lingtian said mightily.

“Exterminated…”

Then, a glint flashed in Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

Some past events that were almost forgotten floated in her mind immediately.

In her previous life, she had once cultivated in Xuanling Sect. A long time after leaving the sect, she happened to hear that Xuanling Sect was exterminated in a night…

The Grand Elder… Elder Mo… Elder Qin. All the higher-ups of Xuanling Sect were killed, and Xuanling Sect vanished from then on.

In her previous lifetime, Ye Qingtang did not have any feelings towards Xuanling Sect, and even when she heard rumors of Xuanling Sect’s extermination, she did not feel anything. Even more so, that period of time was almost forgotten…

However…

It was no longer the same after her rebirth.

Unknowingly, Xuanling Sect had found a way into her heart.

There were too many things that she could not break off from the sect.

Master Elder Mo, Elder Qin… those fellow disciples whom she was close to…

Thinking about it carefully now, the only force in the area which could wipe out Xuanling Sect without a sound was the powerful Yunxiao Sect!

“Hahaha… There are Yunxiao Sect disciples hiding in your Xuanling Sect as well.”

Ye Qingtang returned to her senses and heard Fu Lingtian.

“Who is it?!” Elder Mo roared sternly.

“Who is it?” Fu Lingtian scoffed. “So what if you all know? Could it be that you all dare to touch a Yunxiao Sect disciple?”

Fu Lingtian was aware that Yunxiao Sect would definitely not forgive him after he displayed his true skills. Now, he no longer had any fears, and, all the more, there was nothing he was afraid to say.

“If you don’t say it, I’ll take your life!” Elder Mo assumed a posture in preparation to attack.

“Wait!” Suddenly, Elder Lin walked forward and stopped Elder Mo.

“Elder Mo, we must investigate this matter clearly. If he really is a Yunxiao Sect disciple, we must not touch him at all!” Elder Lin said.

This time, Elder Qin agreed with Elder Lin. Fu Lingtian only said that he was a Yunxiao Sect disciple, but there was no concrete evidence. Moreover, this matter implicated too many things, and any decisions could only be made after investigating clearly.

“Alright. This matter cannot be delayed. I’ll bring him back to the sect first and report this matter to the Grand Elder and Sect Master!” Elder Mo said.

“Okay.” Ye Qingtang nodded her head in agreement.

Subsequently, Elder Mo grabbed Fu Lingtian and flew into the sky, disappearing without a trace.
