The person was someone they didn’t even know… Otherwise, they would not say such words.

Furthermore, the Blood Moon Holy Lord was merely a clone. He had already vanished into thin air when she was in the First Domain. It could be seen that the Blood Moon Holy Lord did not seem to have any great malice towards her.

However, if that was the case, who was the person with the red mark between his brows that the little azure dragon mentioned earlier? She had never provoked such a person before, so why should she beware of him?

For a moment there, Ye Qingtang was also confused. However, for some reason, she found herself unwittingly concerned and sensitive about this matter. She instinctively looked towards the glabella of Nangong Lie, Lei Yan and the others.

After examining everyone, Ye Qingtang looked at the space between the yellow dog’s eyebrows.

“What are you looking at?” The big yellow dog wagged its tail and asked Ye Qingtang. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Ye Qingtang rolled her eyes.

“Boss, that was a voice transmission stone just now, right?” Mu Ziying looked at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang nodded slightly. It was indeed a voice transmission stone. It was no big secret.

“Eh… the voice that came from the voice transmission stone just now… why did it call you little girl? Little girl?!” Nangong Lie stared at Ye Qingtang in shock and disbelief.

Ye Qingtang, “…”

“Oh my god, Boss, who was that? So disgusting and even called you a little girl. Is he a pervert?” Nangong Lie said.

“Yes, a very good friend. I’m used to it.” Ye Qingtang chuckled.

“Boss, you’re right. I have a childhood friend who keeps calling me Little Yan. If I could defeat him, I would definitely kill him. But Boss, your friend is even more extreme. Comparatively speaking, that childhood friend of mine… is rather polite.” Lei Yan seemed to be deep in thought.

“I don’t think this is the time to discuss that.”

By the side, Lu Yuanxiang was already drenched in cold sweat as he watched the battle between the demons below.

This was the first time Lu Yuanxiang had seen a demon with his own eyes in his entire life. Furthermore, the strength of these demons was too terrifying. Even though they were so far away from him, the aura exuded by the demons made him tremble in fear.

All of them, including Ye Qingtang, would definitely die if they met a powerful demon head-on.

These demons were different from the above-Emperor level monsters in the Wailing Well. Those monsters did not have any intelligence and were just mindless killing machines.

If you encountered an above-Emperor level monster in the Wailing Well, you might still have a chance to live. But if you met the demons in this realm… you would definitely die!

“What’re you afraid of? They haven’t noticed us.” Qin Feng spoke.

The current situation might really be a little better than their situation in the Wailing Well.

“Teacher Ye Qing, what do we do now? Can you continue to use your Space Technique?” The Flying Star Academy teacher did not want to stay in this damned place for a moment longer.

Everyone looked at Ye Qingtang expectantly.

“No.” Ye Qingtang shook her head. “Every time I use the Space Technique, I expend a lot of energy. My energy is almost depleted and I need time to replenish my reserves again. It will take at least a few days.”

“That’s fine too.” Lu Yuanxiang nodded. They should be able to survive the next few days if they were careful.

The most frightening thing would be if Ye Qingtang could not take them away. As long as they could leave, there was hope for survival..
