Chapter 837 Despair (2)

“Please give me a chance to turn over a new leaf… I’m begging you!!” The youth’s body trembled, and he implored continuously, wishing to find a means of survival from this despair.

“Ah… Are you only fifteen years old?” The elderly in a Daoist robe sighed softly, and a trace of refusal emerged in his eyes when he saw the Peerless School disciple’s young-looking face.

“Yes, senior. I really dare not lie to you! I… I am really only fifteen years old.” The youth replied honestly. As he saw that the elderly in a Daoist robe had eased up a little, hope arose in him immediately.

“Do you really know that you’re wrong?” The elderly in a Daoist robe hesitated for a moment and asked.

“I know that I’m in the wrong! I really know that I’m in the wrong and definitely will not dare to do it again. I swear to god!” The youth clutched onto this last thread of survival and immediately pointed to the sky with three fingers in an act of swearing.

“Will you really change your ways in the future and not bully the old and weak?” The elderly in a Daoist robe asked the youth again.

“Yes, I’ll definitely not!” The youth nodded with a firm expression, afraid that any hesitation would offend this elderly in a Daoist robe.

“If you realized this earlier, wouldn’t there be no trouble at all?” The elderly in a Daoist robe sighed softly as he looked at the youth, seeming to be expecting better from him.

“You lectured me correctly. From now on, I will definitely remember your words and not dare to do it again!” the youth said hurriedly If he knew that the skills of this elderly in a Daoist robe were so high, he definitely would not dare to offend him no matter how bold he was!

“Alright. Let me ask you: were those two senior brothers of yours in the wrong?” The elderly in a Daoist robe asked suddenly.

“They were in the wrong!” The youth nodded immediately.

“Do they deserve to die?” The elderly in a Daoist robe asked again.

“They deserve to die!” The youth replied without hesitation.

“Do you deserve to die then?” The elderly in a Daoist robe asked.

“Deserve to die!” The youth replied instinctively.

However…

The moment this Peerless School disciple finished his sentence, the elderly in a Daoist robe used his palm as a knife and slit the disciple’s neck immediately. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

In an instant, the youth was slaughtered, and his skull flew into the sky. Large gushes of blood spouted out like a fountain, and an intense smell of blood filled the air.

The detached skull still had a look of disbelief on its face.

Most likely, at the moment that Peerless School disciple died, he was still unable to understand why his last thread of survival was actually snipped off without a sound.

With a thud, the youth’s skull landed on the ground and cracked into pieces.

“Very good. You indeed know that you’re wrong. I am extremely gratified.” The elderly in a Daoist robe had a relieved expression as he looked at the youth’s headless body collapsing onto the ground.

Even Ye Qingtang shuddered upon witnessing the sight in the dark.

The skills of that elderly in a Daoist robe were granted, yet he gave that Peerless School disciple so much hope earlier on, as though he would let him off.

In the end, however, that elderly in a Daoist robe crushed that youth’s hope instantly!

That youth probably would not have thought that the hope he was given would actually be destroyed at that moment.

The change in his mind was from one end to the other, and it was even scarier than killing that youth…

From aside, Master Du watched the bloody scene with a deep frown without saying anything
