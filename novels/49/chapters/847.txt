Chapter 848 Glazed Cup

Ye Qingtang did not have any special relations with Yin Yang Child and had only met him a few times when she was in the Central Dynasty. Then, she felt that it was extremely unbelievable that he could enter Eternal Dynasty’s Honor Roll List for the younger generation at such a young age.

Ye Qingtang frowned deeply when she saw Yin Yang Child’s skull being cut off by the elderly’s scepter instantly. While Yin Yang Child’s martial skills were suppressed because he entered this mainland, that black-robed elderly faced the same treatment as well…

However, before Ye Qingtang could think deeply, she realized that Yin Yang Child’s headless body did not collapse and instead took two steps forward.

In the next second, Yin Yang Child regrew a skull at a visible speed!

“Yin Yang Child…” The black-robed elderly was astonished. “You… actually possess the body of indestructibility!”

Emotionless, the youth stared at the elderly before him coldly. “What I hate most in my life is people calling me a child. You… make me very angry.”

“Humph!” The black-robed elderly scoffed, and the valiant aura of an Arcane Supremacy emerged around him.

Although it was said that the spirit energy on this mainland was too thin, while both the martial realms of Yin Yang Child and the black-robed elderly were suppressed to the Yin Yang Perfected Lord realm, the overbearing manner of an Arcane Supremacy was, however, not weakened.

“I’m also an Arcane Supremacy. Are you thinking of using your overbearing manner to intimidate me?” Yin Yang Child asked coldly.

“Little thing. You’ve only entered the Arcane Supremacy for a while. How dare you be so insolent to me!” The black-robed elderly shouted angrily.

This shout was so powerful that even Ye Qingtang, who hid in the corner, could not help but frown deeply and turn pale.

Those people were already a Supremacy, and although the insufficient spirit energy caused their skills to be suppressed to the Yin Yang Perfected Lord realm, the current Ye Qingtang was like an ant when compared to them.

Swoosh! UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Then, a gleam flashed across.

In a flash, the black-robed elderly’s right arm was chopped off by the sword in Yin Yang Child’s hand.

“How’s that?” Yin Yang Child said indifferently without looking back.

Despite losing an arm, the black-robed elderly did not even frown, making it seem as though it was nothing important.

“Good… Yin Yang Child, I will not hound you. The enmity between us has deepened again because of this one arm.” As the black-robed elderly spoke, his entire body faded and vanished from the place.

After the black-robed elderly left, Yin Yang Child’s complexion seemed a little pale.

Although it was a body of indestructibility, he required a large supply of spirit energy to achieve it. However, the spirit energy on this mainland was overly thin, and it was a little difficult even for Yin Yang Child to bear with it.

Body of indestructibility. Ye Qingtang was in thought.

It was rumored that Yin Yang Child had a top blue spirit root that allowed him to understand the Paragon Skill, the body of indestructibility. As long as his heart was not destroyed and the spirit root was not reduced, he would not die.

“Glazed Cup…”

As Ye Qingtang was lost in her thoughts, she saw a Glazed Cup floating in the air.

There was an extremely rich spirit energy in the Glazed Cup, and if Ye Qingtang could obtain it, she could easily break through to the Yin Yang Perfected Lord realm!

Immediately, Ye Qingtang ignored Yin Yang Child and walked towards the Glazed Cup.
