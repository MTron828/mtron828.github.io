Chapter 504 On Oneself (1)

“Old thing.” Ye Qingtang had no fear at all as she made eye contact with the Yunxiao Sect Elder. “I am Xuanling Sect’s Ye Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Qingtang. From now on, I will kill any of your Yunxiao Sect disciples that I see, regardless of the number.”

At that instant, the Blood Moon Elder hid behind Ye

Qingtang, and his face was rather pale.

Who exactly gave her the courage to provoke a Yunxiao Sect

Elder like this?!

He was afraid that both he and the Ye Qingtang would die in the hands of this Yunxiao Sect Elder today…

“Xuanling Sect?” The Yunxiao Sect Elder’s face darkened.

They already found out from Ning Luo that Xuanling Sect knew of Yunxiao Sect’s secret, and Yunxiao Sect would use arandom excuse to completely annihilate Xuanling Sect soon.

However, what surprised the Yunxiao Sect Elder was that there was actually a disciple at the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level

Two in Xuanling Sect.

The Yunxiao Sect Elder originally suspected that this girl was a disciple from the other super sects in Formidable Heavens

Dynasty, but it seemed that his guess was wrong.

“You are Ye Qingtang, the person who Ye You wants dead,” said the Yunxiao Sect elder coldly as he recalled Ye You mentioning to kill Ye Qingtang when they talked about

Xuanling Sect.

“Ha…” A sinister laugh emerged in Ye Qingtang’s eyes. “Go back and tell Ye You that one day, I will find her and retrieve whatever that belonged to me from the start. Let her cherish this period of peace that is hard to come by.”

“Young one, you must die today!” The Yunxiao Sect Elder

shouted sternly.

In an instant, the martial aura flooded the area, and it was as though the entire mountain was shaking from the imposing aura.

The Yunxiao Sect Elder slapped the air.

This slap pierced the air, and its size turned into about dozens of meters large. His palm was like the giant tip of a mountain, screeching with a horrifying sound, wanting to kill both Ye

Qingtang and the Blood Moon Sect Elder together!

Swoosh!

Fearless, Ye Qingtang took out another talisman from her space

ring.

As the giant palm landed, the talisman held in between Ye

Qingtang’s fingers burned into ashes instantly.

Boom!

Chantings sounded in the air as though it was the singing of the ancient gods, causing one’s heart to quiver.

In the next second, a Kingdom of God appeared and suppressed the Yunxiao Sect Elder rapidly.

“Kingdom of God Array Formation?!”

The Yunxiao Sect Elder’s expression changed when he noticed

the situation.

There was a Kingdom of God Array Formation sealed in thetalisman that Ye Qingtang used this time, which was even more powerful than the one Yue Tiancheng used to trap Ji

Yixuan.

Facing the repression of the Kingdom of God, the Yunxiao

Sect Elder could only halt his intent to murder and retreat

backward.

However…

The Kingdom of God covered over ten kilometers around, and

the power of gods was hard to block, refusing to let the

Yunxiao Sect Elder off.

“Haha…” Ye Qingtang looked at the Yunxiao Sect elder and uttered. “Remember, old scoundrel. I am Xuanling Sect’s Ye

Qingtang and am also the person destined to annihilate your Yunxiao Sect. If you have the ability to, kill me in the cradle before that happens. Otherwise, when I’ve grown, I will definitely annihilate your entire Yunxiao Sect!”

Afterward, Ye Qingtang gave the Blood Moon Elder a look, and both of them retreated, disappearing without a trace.

A long time after Ye Qingtang left, an alarming rumble sounded in the mountain valley.

The Kingdom of God Array Formation was broken by the

Yunxiao Sect Elder and vanished into thin air completely.

At that instant, the Yunxiao Sect Elder’s face was extremely dark as he looked at the direction that Ye Qingtang left in as though he wanted to devour someone.

“Xuanling Sect… Ye Qingtang!”
