Chapter 2068: Complete Victory (3)

“You Qiong, don’t leave your room for the time being. There will be trouble if the Crimson League sees you,” Ye Qingtang told him.

The injuries on his face had already more or less healed and he would be recognized by Mi and the others in an instant if he went out.

You Qiong nodded.

With Ning Luo protecting them, she could rest assured for Little You Yun and Little Luo as well. She headed back to her room and called Ling Yan in.

The little white tiger, who had been left abandoned in the room, quickly jumped up as it saw Ye Qingtang. But when it crawled back to where it was after seeing Ling Yan behind her.

D*mn him!

He was here again!

“Miss Ye, you look like you have something to tell me?” Ling Yan asked her with a smile.

“That’s right. The Crimson League wasn’t able to find the Spirit of Chaos fragments with the Ancient You Clan this time. Do you know anything about that?” she asked.

Ling Yan nodded as he looked at her with eyes full of laughter.

“Miss Ye must have found what the Crimson League didn’t manage to find.”

Ye Qingtang was speechless.

It wasn’t fun at all talking to such a smart person.

“Miss Ye, you don’t want to hand over the Spirit of Chaos fragments so quickly since you’re afraid that the Crimson League will leave once they have obtained all the fragments and recast the Spirit of Chaos. There would be a terrible battle if the Ancient You Clan were to regain their strength.” Ling Yan pointed out all the calculations that she had made.

In response, she shrugged and said, “You’re right. Since the Ancient You Clan hasn’t completely been eradicated, I will make use of the Crimson League.”

At this stage she had yet to decide whether she wanted to hand over the fragments but seeing the way things were going, she was only going to hand the fragments over after the Ancient You Clan was completely wiped out.

When that time came, she would hand over the fragments to the Crimson League and they would leave, which meant she could finally heave a sigh of relief.

After discussing with Ye Qingtang about a few other things, Ling Yan left. But he didn’t return straight to his room, he went to Ning Luo’s room first. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

As You Qiong stayed next door, only Ning Luo and the two children were in the room. Ning Luo wasn’t surprised at all to see Ling Yan but prepared himself.

“Why did you need to come and see me? Haven’t I already kept my promise to you?” Ling Yan smiled as his eyes moved to Little You Yun, who was on the bed.

Ning Luo’s gaze remained guarded.

“I’ve already told you all that you want to know, but...” he froze as he saw Ling Yan’s gaze turn complicated.

“Ling Yan, what exactly do you want? I’ve noticed ever since we were in the First Mainland that you’ve always been helping her, but your actions now are making me suspicious. Why do you need me for this? Just what is it you are planning?”

Ling Yan smiled slightly as he lowered his eyes.

“When have my intentions ever changed? Since I’ve already fulfilled your wish for you, you don’t need to worry about the rest.”

A bark of cold laughter erupted from Ning Luo.

“If not for my master, I would never have worked with someone like you.”

Ling Yan shrugged slightly, not bothered at all by his remarks. They exchanged a few other words in a low voice before Ling Yan turned to leave.

Ning Luo suddenly spoke up as they reached the door.

“Ling Yan.”

“Yes?”

Ning Luo fell back into silence.

Regardless, Ling Yan seemed to know what he wanted to say but chose not to reply. He pushed open the door and left.
