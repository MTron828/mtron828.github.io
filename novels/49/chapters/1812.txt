Chapter 1813: God and Demon (3)

The Heavenly Demon looked rather annoyed at the petals swirling around the woman. He swept them aside and then suddenly lifted her off her feet.

Ye Qingtang, “...”

She felt that the relationship between these two was increasingly ambiguous.

Ye Qingtang hadn’t taken a single step but the scenery around her shifted as the Heavenly Demon and the woman progressed through the fields. The distance between them and Ye Qingtang was maintained such that she could see their every action and hear the woman’s laughter, but...

She had yet to see the face of that Heavenly Demon.

The Heavenly Demon and the woman seemed intent on leaving the vicinity of the temple. They passed through the forest and came to a quiet riverside. The woman jumped down from the arms of the Heavenly Demon and lifted the hem of her skirt slightly. Taking off her shoes and socks, she dipped her fair feet gently in the water.

As the water rippled, that familiar tune once again sounded out her lips.

That voice was full of bliss and contentment. Like the first time, Ye Qingtang felt the strong urge to smile when she heard that melody.

Meanwhile, the Heavenly Demon stood quietly behind her. Still, Ye Qingtang could not see his face.

But somehow, she could tell that at this moment, the Heavenly Demon would have no eyes for anyone else but that figure playing with the water.

It was as if...

Nothing in this wide world could compare to the slight curl of that woman’s lips.

Ye Qingtang was increasingly suspicious of the relationship between these two. But before she could study them further, the scene before her gradually faded.

In the blink of an eye, Ye Qingtang had once again returned to the temple.

The woman was quietly standing in the temple.

The Shining God was seated on the altar. His lips were moving and his brows slightly furrowed. He looked like he was reprimanding the woman.

Even though the woman’s face was half-covered by the veil, one could still see her defiance from the faint crease of her brows and the slight narrowing of her eyes.

“Shining God, I know what I am doing.” The woman suddenly spoke up. Her bright eyes held an irrepressible light.

The Shining God’s frown deepened. But the woman no longer wished to argue with him. She turned and flew out of the temple.

The moment the woman flew out, Ye Qingtang felt like she was being pulled along. The scenery around her changed and soon after, the woman had once again arrived at the river from the previous illusion. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

A tall, strapping figure stood there quietly, as if pondering something. He looked like he had been waiting for a long time. Wasting no time, the woman threw her slender body onto the Heavenly Demon’s back and hugged him tightly.

Stiffening slightly, the Heavenly Demon was about to turn when the woman murmured, “Don’t move.”

The Heavenly Demon stayed still. He seemed to have detected the sadness in her voice.

“The Shining God wants me to go back. He is forbidding me to step into this place.” The woman’s voice was muffled as she buried her face in the Heavenly Demon’s broad back.

The Heavenly Demon was stunned.

“I will fight to stay here. Even if I have to give up my True God status, I will remain here, together with you,” the woman stated with determination.

Ye Qingtang was completely dumbstruck.

Previously, she could have still tried to convince herself that their ambiguous relationship was just a figment of her overactive imagination, but now...

The proof was staring at her straight in the face!

This female True God had actually fallen in love with a Heavenly Demon?!!
