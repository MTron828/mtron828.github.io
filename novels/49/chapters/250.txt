Chapter 249: Inquiry (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

As Elder Huang examined Ye Qingtang, the other three outer sect elders were secretly observing the young girl before them as well.

After a moment, Elder Huang then took the lead and asked, “What exactly happened in Spirit Condensation Mountain Village?”

Ye Qingtang immediately let out the whole story.

After her account, the four elders’ expressions were not too good.

Spirit Condensation Mountain Village was affiliated to Xuanling Sect. If the village master, Wu Chengze, really switched to worship the Blood Moon Sect as Ye Qingtang said, it would be a humiliation to Xuanling Sect that could not be erased.

If words were to spread about the affiliation with an orthodox sect that was infatuated with resurrecting an evil spirit, would it not attract ridicule?

Elder Huang narrowed his eyes. He recalled Ye Qingtang’s words but did not find any suspicious areas. Moreover, Ye Qingtang was merely a new disciple and would not be bold enough to make up such an outrageous lie.

But there was one point…

“Ye Qingtang, you are a new disciple, but why would you go on a sect mission together with Zhou Xuan and the rest?” asked Elder Huang without expressions. Ye Qingtang’s appearance in this team itself was extremely illogical.

Once he said that, the warden standing from aside immediately started breaking out in a cold sweat.

Ye Qingtang glanced over the warden’s pale expression, and a hint of laughter flashed past her eyes. “I am unaware as well. I listened to the warden’s arrangement for everything. The warden told me to join Senior Brother Zhou’s team, so that’s what I did.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ye Qingtang’s casual reply was but a huge rock on the warden’s mind.

The faces of all elders darkened, and Elder Huang even gave the warden a cold look.

“Should a new disciple be participating in the mission for Zhou Xuan and the rest?”

The warden’s face turned pale, and he hurriedly knelt down as cold sweat trickled down his body.

“Since you can’t even handle this properly, Xuanling Sect does not need such a useless person like you anymore. Leave the sect immediately,” Elder Huang said emotionlessly, driving that warden out of Xuanling Sect..

The warden’s face turned green immediately. He had been through so many things and contributed so much to climb up to this outer sect warden position. Never had he thought that his career would be ended right now because of his greed of a moment!

The warden wanted to plead for mercy but was immediately ordered to be sent away by Elder Huang.

No one was allowed to break the sect rules.

There was no emotion on Ye Qingtang’s face as she watched the warden being forcefully carried away. From the start, she already knew that Zhou Xuan bribed the warden, which was why the warden changed her team. It was obvious that the warden knew about Zhou Xuan’s intentions but still handed her into Zhou Xuan’s hands for his own gains.

Towards such a person, Ye Qingtang was not sympathetic at all.

“We will send people to get to the bottom of this matter. Before the investigation is completed, both Lin Long and you should not take on any missions temporarily. If there is a need, we will summon you two for inquiry,” said Elder Huang.

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

Elder Huang did not say anything further and let Ye Qingtang return first.

Once Ye Qingtang left, the other three elders who had remained silent throughout finally said something.

“This Ye Qingtang is rather mature and not like ordinary new disciples. I heard from the Rewards Pavilion warden previously that she beheaded a villain on the Assassination Roll by herself and thought that it was misinformation. Now, it seems that she is pretty good,” praised the elder of the outer sect’s Array Faction as he watched Ye Qingtang’s fading back view.
