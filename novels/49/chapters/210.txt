With that said, Mu Su’s legs suddenly turned jelly.

What did he say?

He actually said that His Highness was a wife of a bandit chief?

And it was even heard by His Highness…

There was no way he would get by the days!

“Your Highness, listen… listen to my explanation… I uh…” Mu Su really was about to cry as he looked at Han Cangming. Had he known that His Highness would appear at that time, he would definitely not dare to ramble on randomly even if everyone lent him their courage!

Your Highness, why did you not appear earlier nor later but right at that time…

Did you really not appear to torture me on purpose?

Mu Su was still thinking about how to make His Highness pardon him from death, but he noticed that…

Han Cangming’s eyes did not even stay on him at all; they looked right over him and at the little figure which was riding away in the opposite direction.

Is His Highness looking at Lady Ye?

Mu Su’s heart shook. He faintly sensed that the eyes that His Highness were looking at Ye Qingtang with were a little different from their initial coldness.

Could it be that… towards Lady Ye, His Highness really “developed feelings after spending time together” in this half a month?

“Uh… Your Highness, are you feeling better?” Mu Su asked cautiously. Han Cangming turned into animal form previously because of the surge of the Aura of the Evil. Now that he could return back into a human form, it seemed that… there should not be any big problems anymore.

“It is alright.” Han Cangming replied.

Mu Su heaved a sigh of relief but did not dare to speak carelessly again, as he was afraid that Han Cangming would behead him once he remembered what he said about being the “wife of the bandit chief.”

…

On the other side, Ye Qingtang was on their way to Spirit Condensation Mountain Village with Lin Long and the rest.

After a long day of traveling, the group stopped their journey as night fell. They lit a fire in a forest by the road and rested.

“Senior Brother Zhou, the Village Master of Spirit Condensation Mountain Village is skilled, and there are a large number of highly-skilled people in the village protecting the village. How could it disappear just like that?” A disciple could not help but question after pondering about the case.

Zhou Xuan replied. “This is hard to say. With over three hundred people dying in a night, it was impossible for the surrounding people to not know of such a big commotion. Furthermore, that entire area is under the influence of Spirit Condensation Mountain Village. If there was anything, the people outside the mountain village would definitely not sit still and do nothing. However, the report to the sect did not mention this. I think… perhaps the other party might have poisoned them in secret.”

Over three hundred people were killed in a night in Spirit Condensation Mountain Village, and it could be said that the amount of blood within the village could form a river. Yet, no one outside the sect realized it, and this was a little strange.

People nearby Spirit Condensation Mountain Village had investigated the matter before as well, but there was still no clue. Hence, they had no choice but to request Xuanling Sect for help.

“Could it be a vendetta?”

“Can’t be sure.”

Zhou Xuan and the two other disciples chatted by the fire. Lin Long had a quiet personality, and, thus, she only sat at a side while reading the file without saying anything at all.

And because of what Zhou Xuan deliberately said previously, the other two disciples disliked Ye Qingtang. On the journey, they were unwilling to speak to Ye Qingtang and treated her as though she did not exist.

During the conversation, Zhou Xuan purposely looked up casually at Ye Qingtang, who made her own fire, and his lips formed into a sneer.

Ye Qingtang, cherish your limited days left. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Once we reach Spirit Condensation Mountain Village, I will bury you together with those three hundred dead souls in the village!
