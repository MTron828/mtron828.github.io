Chapter 2524: Dog Is Angry (7)

“Interesting…” The big yellow dog scrutinized Ye Qingtang’s chest.

“What do you mean?” Ye Qingtang frowned slightly.

“The seal in your body is almost gone, right?” The big yellow dog asked.

Ye Qingtang’s expression changed immediately. Of course Ye Qingtang knew which seal the big yellow dog was referring to.

“Haha, little girl, this is a very common sealing technique. What’s in there that you need to seal? Take it out and let me have a look.” The big yellow dog wagged its tail.

Ye Qingtang, “…” If she took it out, would she be able to live? It was her heart that was sealed.

“Eh, why are there two additional auras on your body?” The yellow dog was suddenly startled. “They are not planning to let you go.”

Ye Qingtang just smiled. “Not me…”

“Then who?” The yellow dog was confused.

“It’s us,” Ye Qingtang replied naturally.

The big yellow dog glanced at Ye Qingtang. “I have no grudge with them. Those people are your enemies. It has nothing to do with me.”

“You’re right. It’s a pity that you forgot one thing.” Ye Qingtang’s lips curled up slightly. “They don’t think so. Now that we are on the same side, we have to face the enemy together.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Eh, I’m tired of fighting and killing. I want to go home…” The big yellow dog looked up at the sky.

“Brother Canine, don’t worry. When we are safe and find a place to stay, I will definitely get you several luxurious kennels,” the Blood Moon Elder said from the side.

Ye Qingtang looked at the big yellow dog thoughtfully. “Why are you looking at the sky when you want to go home? Is your house still in the sky?”

“My house is indeed in the sky. How can I go back…?” The big yellow dog lowered its head as if it was really thinking about how to fly.

Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched. Damn, this dog was acting up again.

“Holy Lady, where should we go now?” The Blood Moon Elder looked at Ye Qingtang in confusion. Ever since he was resurrected, he had been on the run with the Holy Lady.

Ye Qingtang did not say anything. She also had her doubts.

Previously, Ye Qingtang wanted to head to the Dragon Emperor Clan to investigate. However, now that she was being chased by those two factions, she might be in too much trouble now.

If she were to head to the Dragon Emperor Clan before resolving this, she would not be protected by the clan as she could not reveal her identity. On the contrary… If she were to head to the Temple of Paragon, the outcome would be very different.

However, Ye Qingtang felt a headache when she thought of the Temple of Paragon. Although she helped them to deal with the Sea King, if they realized that she was not the reincarnation of the Paragon, would they tear her to pieces?

“Let’s go to the Temple of Paragon,” Ye Qingtang said after a long while.

At this current stage, it was more important for Ye Qingtang to resolve her imminent troubles first. And the only one who could help her deal with it quickly was the Temple of Paragon.

Regardless, the Temple of Paragon owed her a favor. After all, if not for her, the Sea King would not be so easily fooled.

“Holy Lady, what did you say?” The Blood Moon Elder was stunned. What did his Holy Lady say just now? Did he hear wrongly or did the Holy Lady speak wrongly…

The Temple of Paragon?!
