Chapter 1774: Great General (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Of course the Great General is most powerful.” Another little fiendish demon spoke up in a voice full of respect.

“It is truly a terrifying experience to feel the Great General’s power. He can smash me with just one finger.”

Fear still lingered in the hearts of the bunch of little fiendish demons. It was a rare occasion for them to meet the Great General. As they had just been born, this was actually the first time they were meeting him.

“Look at how weak you all are. You’d better grow up soon. Otherwise, you will just faint dead away when you meet demons from the Heavenly Demon Tribe, the Emperor Demon Tribe and the Earth Demon Tribe,” Ba commented disdainfully when he noticed the frightened faces of the little fiendish demons.

“Are you talking about the three major demon tribes?” One of the little fiendish demons asked.

Ba nodded. “You little punks are in camp all day long, you don’t know just how dangerous things are outside. The enemy factions we are battling now are nothing compared to those three major tribes. I think you will be scared to death just by looking at them...”

Ye Qingtang’s attention was instantly attracted at the mention of those three major tribes.

There were countless fiendish demon factions in this mountain valley. Amongst them, there were three of the most powerful camps. They sat right at the top, suppressing the rest of the demons like three huge mountains.

These three big factions represented absolute power. They were the mightiest tribes amongst the entire fiendish demon population.

They were the Heavenly Demon Tribe, the Earth Demon Tribe and the Emperor Demon Tribe...

Ye Qingtang had heard other fiendish demons mention these three tribes, but had never seen a single demon from either of those tribes before.

It was rumored that the appearance of the fiendish demons from these tribes was different from the rest. Their abilities were powerful beyond belief.

As fierce as the battles were amongst the different demon factions now, just one puff from either one of the major tribes would be enough to shake the entire valley.

Demons from the other camps would never dare to provoke the big three tribes. If they happened to chance upon any one of them, they would try their best to avoid and hide.

The eastern camp, where Ye Qingtang was currently situated, was totally insignificant when compared to those three. Having witnessed the ability of the eastern camp’s Great General, Ye Qingtang found it difficult to imagine just how powerful those three top tribes were.

The Great General’s powers were already beyond her comprehension. How much more terrifying would those three elite tribes be?

Ye Qingtang’s scalp tingled just at the thought of it. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Nevertheless...

The war between the fiendish demons was meaningless to her. If not for her lack of opportunity, she would have already escaped far away.

...

After several days of investigation, they finally uncovered the origins of that Soul-Devouring Beast.

As expected, the appearance of that Soul-Devouring Beast was no coincidence. The beast was the war pet of the western Great General, and had been specially sent over to the eastern camp to cause maximum destruction.

The eastern fiendish demons were jumping with rage when they found out it was a ploy by their arch nemesis. A huge battle ignited between the two camps, rising to a feverish pitch in just half a month.

Apart from the little fiendish demons, all other demons, even those weaklings like Ye Qingtang, had been summoned to the frontline of the battle.
