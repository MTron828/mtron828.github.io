Chapter 506 On Oneself (3)

Is she really only fifteen?

Her thinking was so meticulous and extremely complex. Even those old people who have lived for a hundred years might not match up to her.

If she were a friend, she could provide an inexplicable sense of security, but if she is an enemy…

At that thought, the Blood Moon Elder was in deep thought. Should he quickly decide to continue to wait for a chance to kill her with one strike or to…

“Go. It’s not safe to stay here for long!” Ye Qingtang waved, bringing the Blood Moon Elder away immediately.

After Ye Qingtang’s departure, Yunxiao Sect was extremely infuriated.

A person who claimed to be Ye Qingtang, a Xuanling Sect disciple, injured more than ten outer sect disciples and two inner sect disciples while Yue Tiancheng, the disciple of the Sect Master who had been missing for many days, was killed by her. In the mountain, she assassinated an elder’s disciple, Li Jiwu, before the elder using the Array Formation in a talisman that she obtained from Yue Tiancheng and even used the Kingdom of God Array Formation to repress the elder!

“Ye Qingtang…”

Within Yunxiao Sect, the corners of Ning Luo’s lips curled after he heard the news. His deep eyes gazed at the sky as he mumbled. “It really is getting more and more interesting. Grandfather’s plan is being carried out slowly. This piece of land is changing ultimately… However, the appearance of Ye Qingtang is really unexpected. I hope… you can live on. Ye Qingtang, we… will still meet.”

In wrath, Yunxiao Sect sent a total of fifteen disciples—ten outer sect elite disciples, four inner sect disciples, and one inner sect elite disciple—on that day to go after Ye Qingtang and behead her to vent their anger. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Considering that Ye Qingtang might still have array formations in talismans, the Yunxiao Sect Sect Master bestowed the inner sect elite disciple a talisman.

The Great Perishing Curse was sealed in the talisman, and it would be difficult for Ye Qingtang to resist it even if she still had talismans.

At the same time, the various large cities near Yunxiao Sect were completely sealed, stopping the entry and exit of everyone. Furthermore, they put up portraits of Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder and made a public announcement that if any cultivators not in a sect captured or killed them, they could head to Yunxiao Sect to receive a generous reward.

The same night, Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder had already predicted that this would happen and thus did not remain there and headed straight to a Blood Moon Sect Division.

In the most remote area of a mountain the next morning.

Ye Qingtang suddenly opened her eyes as she looked behind her coldly.

“Someone is here!” the Blood Moon Elder said, alarmed. “Fifteen auras. Ten of them are at… Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two, and another four people are at the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three. The last person is at the peak of the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three…” Ye Qingtang mumbled after feeling the auras.

With such states of cultivation, these fifteen people were definitely Yunxiao Sect disciples.

Ye Qingtang had already guessed that Yunxiao Sect definitely would not let things go after sealing the cities but did not think that they would arrive so quickly.

Evidently, her previous actions truly enraged Yunxiao Sect. And this was the effect that Ye Qingtang wanted.

However…

Given Ye Qingtang’s current skills, she could fight against the Yunxiao Sect inner sect elite disciple, but the remaining four inner sect disciples were also at the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three. If they attacked together as a group, there was completely no chance of winning for her.

She could not count on the Blood Moon Elder presently. Not mentioning the Yunxiao Sect inner sect disciples, he might not even defeat those Martial Qi Level Two outer sect disciples. “Leavel”

Ye Qingtang disappeared instantly.
