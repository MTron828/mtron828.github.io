Chapter 817 Master (3)

Then, the Peerless School was already a supreme force, and Perfected Xuanchen was a Peak Master of Falling Sky Valley. Although he wanted to destroy the Peerless School indiscriminately, he was worried for the lives of the peak’s disciples and eventually chose to endure it tearfully.

Otherwise, once Perfected Xuanchen attacked the Peerless School disciples, not to mention Perfected Xuanchen’s peak, the entire Falling Sky Valley would encounter a calamity.

Master… I will definitely… take your revenge for you. Ye Qingtang thought as she looked at Perfected Xuanchen beside her.

Not long later, Ye Qingtang realized that Perfected Xuanchen was leaning against the chair and had fallen asleep.

Ye Qingtang placed the wooden case that Master Du handed to her aside. She took out a set of clothes from her space ring and gently placed it on Perfected Xuanchen.

“Master, I’ll take my leave.”

In terms of worries, she was worried about the Ye family and fellow disciples in Xuanling Sect.

And so were the fellow disciples in Falling Sky Valley and Perfected Xuanchen…

Ye Qingtang retreated from the main hall and bowed to Perfected Xuanchen before turning around and leaving the hall.

“Ye Chen?!”

Xuanyuan Lie had just returned to Falling Sky Valley and was surprised to see Ye Qingtang leaving the valley with big strides.

A Full Moon Peak disciple beside Xuanyuan Lie saw Ye Qingtang and said hurriedly, “Senior Brother Xuanyuan, in my opinion, it’s impossible for that fellow to be from the sea of clouds at Mount Qin. Otherwise, how would he enter our Falling Sky Valley… Look at him. He is so anxious to leave. It must be because he knew that he caused big trouble and wants to leave!”

Upon hearing that, Xuanyuan Lie seemed to be in thought and frowned slightly, but a glint twinkled in his eyes.

That day, he never understood why the Peerless School disciple and his grandfather would react that way when Ye Qingtang mentioned “sea of clouds at Mount Qin”.

When he returned to Full Moon Peak that night, his grandfather told him about the rumors regarding the hidden clans and the sea of clouds at Mount Qin.

“Senior Brother Xuanyuan, think about it. If that fellow is really a hidden clan from the sea of clouds at Mount Qin, how is it possible for him to come to the Falling Sky Valley to cultivate? The hidden clan at the sea of clouds at Mount Qin is so powerful…”

The Full Moon Peak disciple beside Xuanyuan Lie grumbled again.

Xuanyuan Lie nodded immediately. He naturally understood what this Full Moon Peak disciple said.

Even his grandfather, the Peak Master of Full Moon Peak, was extremely suspicious of Ye Qingtang’s identity as a member of the hidden clan.

So be it if Ye Qingtang was really from the hidden clan in the sea of clouds at Mount Qin.

But if not…

There was no way they would let go of the fact that Ye Qingtang offended the Peerless School.

Moreover, his grandfather had already ordered him to pay attention to Ye Qingtang’s movements all the time to prevent her from escaping from Falling Sky Valley as they investigated her identity!

“Zhou Tai, go to Full Moon Peak immediately and invite the Peak Master to come out. I’ll follow Ye Chen.” Xuanyuan Lie’s eyes twinkled as he watched Ye Qingtang leave.

“Rest assured, Senior Brother Xuanyuan.” Zhou Tai spun around immediately and rushed towards Full Moon Peak.

Then, Xuanyuan Lie used his primordial qi and flew into the air, chasing after Ye Qingtang. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

At this moment, Ye Qingtang had already left Falling Sky Valley. She stopped in her tracks after coming down from the mountain as she gazed into the sky casually.

With Ye Qingtang’s knowledge and perception, she had already sensed that someone was following her secretly, but… who exactly was that?
