“Young Sir Ye, what exactly do you mean by that?” Qin Chen returned to his senses and asked with slit eyes.

“I want this person,” Ye Qingtang said calmly. Although she was not one hundred percent sure that that mysterious lady was her mother, it should not be wrong according to the clues she had currently.

Qu Xiangyang was very likely someone who could verify this and know the whereabouts of that lady.

“Young Sir Ye, the Qin family respects you for your skills, but Qu Xiangyang was personally ordered to be beheaded by the Emperor. If you want to save him, aren’t you becoming enemy with the entire Nine Nights Dynasty?” Qin Chen said coldly.

“Is it the Emperor who wants to behead me or your father Qin Long? The handwriting on the imperial decree that ordered me to the monarch city is clearly your father’s! It’s your Qin family who deceived the Emperor and passed a false imperial decree to eradicate a dissident!” Qu Xiangyang originally admitted his fate, but with a thread of survival now, he would not let it go.

Qin Chen’s eyes sharpened. If he really allowed Ye Qingtang to rescue Qu Xiangyang, what face would the Qin family have in Nine Nights Dynasty in the future?

Then, Qin Chen secretly sent a guard to relay the news to the premier’s residence while he led the troops to encircle Ye Qingtang and Qu Xiangyang.

“Young Sir Ye, as long as you don’t interfere with this matter today, I will not fuss about it.” Qin Chen warned for the last time.

Yet, Ye Qingtang’s face remained emotionless.

A trace of malice flashed across Qin Chen’s eyes, and he shouted immediately. “Men, capture these two people!”

In just a moment, the surrounding guards rushed in like a swarm of bees.

Qin Chen brought hundreds of guards in this trip, and a group of black-clothed people lunged at Ye Qingtang and Qu Xiangyang. Ye Qingtang glanced at the guards who charged at her and drew out her sword. The moment it was unsheathed, a cold gleam swept across the crowd all of a sudden!

There was no one who could block the cold gleam wherever it passed, and those guards who charged forward were flung away by Ye Qingtang’s sword aura.

In just the blink of an eye, several square meters around Ye Qingtang were already empty.

Astonishment passed Qu Xiangyang’s eyes as he looked at the beautiful young man before him. Standing behind Ye Qingtang, he was a little adrift as he gazed at his slim yet formidable figure.

It was as if the shadow from his memory overlapped with this young man’s back view.

He still remembered that ten years ago when the imperial power was handed down, the former Emperor’s position was shaky. Under pressure from the officials, that shadow glided here and beheaded the traitorous armies, calming the unrest and stabilizing the entire country…

Qu Xiangyang recovered from his surprise absentmindedly.

Hundreds of guards could not withstand a blow from this young man. Cries erupted at every area that the sword aura slashed at, and countless people collapsed on the ground.

A hint of nervousness was evident in Qin Chen’s eyes as he witnessed the sight.

He was very clear that the guards he brought were not the match of a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord. Seeing that there was not even a possibility of delaying the time, Qin Chen immediately turned around and wanted to shuttle through the crowd.

Ye Qingtang sharply noticed Qin Chen’s attempt to flee and chased after immediately.

All Qin Chen felt was a strong oppressive force from his back. Simply unable to react in time, he suddenly felt a tug on his back, and he was instantly pulled back on the back of his collar by Ye Qingtang.
