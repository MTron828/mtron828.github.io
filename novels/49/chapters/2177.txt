Chapter 2178: Gathered (2)

The next morning. Jing Ze arrived at the classroom early and was surprised when he spotted a figure. Before Jing Ze could say anything, Ye Qing walked into the classroom.

When Ye Qingtang saw the figure, she was stunned. Nangong Lie and Lei Yan, who followed behind her, had the same reaction.

“Yun Chen?” Nangong Lie was stupefied.

Wasn’t that Yun Chen who suddenly appeared in the classroom?

What was going on?

Nangong Lie and Lei Yan exchanged glances and they were both perplexed.

Wasn’t it Qin Feng who lost yesterday?

Why...

Why did Yun Chen come instead?

“Yun Chen, why did you come?” Nangong Lie was acquaintances with Yun Chen, so he spoke up.

Yun Chen smiled at Nangong Lie before he took a chair and sat down, looking at Ye Qingtang casually.

Nangong Lie, “...”.

“Hey, what happened? Why does it seem like he’s coming back? I clearly remember that... it should be Qin Feng who’s supposed to turn up today.” Lei Yan was confused.

Yun Chen was now part of the medical faculty, he should be spending time on elixirs, why did he come?

“Who knows?” Nangong Lie was also confused. He tried to convince Yun Chen to come previously and Yun Chen only gave him a smile without planning to come.

But now, what happened?

“Could it be that... Yun Chen had posed as Qin Feng to challenge me yesterday? Is that why he’s here today instead of Qin Feng?” Lei Yan guessed.

Nangong Lie subconsciously walked away.

Stupidity was contagious.

Lei Yan didn’t appear to notice and was still immersed in his wild guesses.

“Yun Chen is part of the medical faculty. It’s not entirely impossible for him to create an elixir that would help him disguise as someone else. Could it be that Qin Feng didn’t want to challenge me so he got Yun Chen to pose as himself? Yun Chen is such a poor thing, he couldn’t say no to Qin Feng and had to...” Lei Yan was even more convinced now. He was completely unaware that Nangong Lie and Jing Ze were judging him, as if they were looking at a fool.

“I’m not that lame.” A cold, unfeeling voice came from Lei Yan’s back.

Lei Yan was stunned, taking two steps back when he realized Qin Feng suddenly appeared behind him.

Lei Yan, “...”.

As Qin Feng looked at Lei Yan, he couldn’t help but feel that challenging a fool like Lei Yan was forever a part of his dark past.

“Teacher Ye.” Qin Feng didn’t want to talk to Lei Yan anymore. Once he saw Ye Qing, he found a seat near Ye Qing and sat down.

“Is this a... package deal?” Nangong Lie touched his chin. He felt that Yun Chen’s appearance today has got something to do with Qin Feng and Lei Yan’s fight yesterday.

Was Yun Chen also there yesterday?

Though Yun Chen wasn’t the most powerful out of the bunch, he was extremely intelligent. There must be a reason behind his sudden appearance today.

Soon after, Mu Ziying also arrived. She hadn’t noticed that there were two more people in the classroom and just found a seat that was nearest to Ye Qing and sat down, behaving well.

Ye Qingtang looked at the six who were finally gathered together and her eyes crinkled into a smile.

Great, they were finally gathered.
