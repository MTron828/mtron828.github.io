Ouyang Qian chuckled. “Young Sir… I’m just here to have a chat with you.”

“Oh? What do you want to chat then?” Ye Qingtang pretended to be ignorant and asked.

“Of course, it’s about the illusion stone…”

Ouyang Qian sat in front of Ye Qingtang slowly. Her lips were tilted slightly. She hugged Ye Qingtang with her hands and murmured beside her ear. “Young Sir… I remember that you said that you want my body to exchange for that… illusion stone…”

“That’s right.” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“Then… what are you waiting for…” Ouyang Qian placed her hands at Ye Qingtang’s back. Her voice was seducing, and it seemed that she was willing to do anything.

“Lady Qian… Are you sure about that?” Ye Qingtang asked meaningfully.

“Of course.” Ouyang Qian smiled, but her eyes were cold. She had intended to kill Ye Qingtang.

Before Ye Qingtang could say anything, Ouyang Qian held her body tightly and said, “However, I believe there’s one sentence that Young Sir should hear before… It goes… It’s an honor to die under a peony flower…”

Coldness swiped through Ouyang Qian’s eyes. A ball of black mist appeared in her hand suddenly, and it seemed to be able to crush Ye Qingtang’s organs.

“What… what do you want?!” Ye Qingtang was shocked.

“Young Sir, you can only blame yourself for your death. If you gave me the illusion stone willingly, you can at least keep your life. How dare you to dream to have sex with me… It’s a pity that your handsome appearance will be gone as well.” Ouyang Qian scorned.

Swoosh!

The moment when Ouyang Qian finished her words, a flare lit up on Ye Qingtang’s body. There was a talisman on her back! Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Arh!”

As the talisman was burning, Ouyang Qian was hit by the intense force from the talisman and vomited blood.

“Talisman array formation… you!” Ouyang Qian’s face was pale, and she stared at Ye Qingtang unbelievably.

The shock on Ye Qingtang’s face was gone, and it was replaced by a cold smile. “I know that you want to ask why was I prepared? That’s because I know you well.”

“You… know me?!” Ouyang Qian could not believe what she just heard.

“Dying under a peony flower… I admit that the sentence is true, but you are no peony flower.” Ye Qingtang smiled.

Based on what Ye Qingtang knew about Ouyang Qian, she would definitely make a move within these few days. That was the reason why Ye Qingtang took out a protection talisman from her space ring and kept it close with her.

“You… what do you want!” Ouyang Qian gritted her teeth.

She did not expect that Ye Qingtang would be prepared earlier with a talisman array formation. And she fell into the trap…

“I want your body.” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“Oh… that is what you want…” Ouyang Qian curled her lips.

“Come in!”

Ye Qingtang did not reply Ouyang Qian but shouted towards outside.

The Blood Moon Elder walked in immediately. He was puzzled and asked, “Holy Lady, what is the great gift that you said…”

“Holy Lady?!”

Ouyang Qian was stunned when she heard the Blood Moon Elder’s words. She stared at Ye Qingtang unbelievably. “You are a woman?!”

However, Ye Qingtang did not bother to explain. She made an evil smile as she looked at the Blood Moon Elder.

“She is the gift.”
