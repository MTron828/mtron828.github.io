“Huh? Are you crazy?” The Blood Moon Sect Elder did not imagine it. He admitted that Ye Qingtang’s skills were indeed not bad and that the speed of her advancement was shocking. However, Fu Lingtian’s skills were an entire realm above hers. What was she going to fight Fu Lingtian with?

Ye Qingtang looked up. The corners of her lips were lifted as she looked at the Blood Moon Sect Elder smilingly. “Didn’t you hear what Fu Lingtian and Ye You said just now?”

“What did they say?” The Blood Moon Sect Elder was at a loss as he assumed that Ye You whom Ye Qingtang mentioned was that female disciple of Yunxiao Sect.

“Fu Lingtian’s skills are at the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two, but does he dare to reveal it?” Ye Qingtang spoke with a seeming smile.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder was slightly dumbfounded. Then, he recalled that Ye You sternly instructed Fu Lingtian to not show his true skills before she left.

“A Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two disciple came to participate in the Three Sect Competition. If this was exposed, how would Wind Moon Sect and Xuanling Sect think? And what kind of reaction would Qinglin Sect have?”

Coldness flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes. When Yunxiao Sect secretly sent Fu Lingtian to Qinglin Sect, they definitely employed the help of other powerful figures. If Qinglin Sect sensed that there was something off about Fu Lingtian, they would definitely investigate it, and by then, perhaps they would find out that Fu Lingtian was actually a Yunxiao Sect disciple.

When it was made known that a mighty super sect actually sent their disciples to an ordinary sect in secret, everyone would suspect what Yunxiao Sect’s motives were.

By then, Yunxiao Sect’s reputation would be completely tarnished.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder thought from another perspective, and indeed as what Ye Qingtang said, Fu Lingtian did not dare to reveal his true abilities.

“So you really want to participate tomorrow?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Ye Qingtang nodded lightly. She needed to become an elite disciple in a short time and had to make a name for herself in this Three Sect Competition.

“There’s no hurry though. Tomorrow is the Three Sect Competition. I want to see how that Fu Lingtian acts in the competition.” Ye Qingtang smiled.

Looking at the coldness that glistened in Ye Qingtang’s eyes, the Blood Moon Sect Elder had a feeling that Ye Qingtang’s stance was completely different when the matter involved Yunxiao Sect. He recalled the shocked expression on her face when Ye You from Yunxiao Sect appeared, and suspicion rose in his heart.

Ye Qingtang… Ye You…

Could it be that there is some enmity between this darn girl and Ye You?

Nevertheless, the Blood Moon Sect Elder did not have the audacity to probe Ye Qingtang directly and could only suppress this guess temporarily.

Ye Qingtang took a deep breath, and a thought appeared in her head suddenly.

“You said that people who cultivated your Blood Moon Sect’s cultivation technique would have the air of the evil spirit?”

“Yeah.” The Blood Moon Sect Elder nodded.

A light flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes suddenly. She still did not know how to find the Yunxiao Sect disciple who was hidden in Xuanling Sect, but she had a good idea now.

“Very well. When this Three Sect Competition ends and we return to Xuanling Sect, you must look carefully. If you discover any Xuanling Sect disciple who has the air of the evil spirit, inform me immediately.”

Yunxiao Sect dared to let their sect disciples cultivate the Blood Moon Sect’s Spirit Seizure Technique so brazenly because they were certain that the Blood Moon Sect was already annihilated, and others that had never learned Blood Moon Sect’s cultivation technique thus would naturally be unable to see the air of the evil spirit.

But Ye Qingtang had a Blood Moon Sect Elder by her side!
