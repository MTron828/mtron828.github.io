Chapter 1609: Fight The War (3)

All of them were looking forward to the disappearance of this parasite. However, they did not know that what they did was far from throwing Ye Qingtang into a pit of fire; rather, they were providing her some timely help!

During this period of time, Ye Qingtang had been troubling over the absence of a chance to go to war, but these knights joined forces to solve her troubles!

Ultimately, Ye Qingtang really wanted to thank their “kindness”.

Ye Qingtang headed to prepare immediately after receiving the orders while the 10,000 soldiers who were called to fight the war, as though they heard the death knell, had haggard expressions and seemed to be filled with despair.

Any soldier who had fought in a war before knew what kind of hopeless situation they were going to face should they fight with such a disparity in numbers.

Furthermore, when they saw that their leading Kingdom Knight was actually a petite teenage girl, their despair intensified, and they almost broke down.

The powerful Joseph and other knights were not even fighting this war, yet a little Kingdom Knight, who god knows popped out from where, was sent instead. If this was not sending them to die, what was?

The war had not even begun, but the 10,000 soldiers of the Supreme League Kingdom already had a hunch of their deaths and were vaguely aware that they would become sacrifices in the kingdom’s war.

“How old is that whatever Knight Tang? Does she know what a war is?”

“Oh god. We are really going to die this time.”

The soldiers grieved incessantly.

Yet, Ye Qingtang, who got onto a horse, was completely unaware, and her eyes shone as though she was looking forward to it greatly.

Her behavior caused the soldiers to sigh even more deeply.

Indeed, she knew nothing. Otherwise, how could she be this relaxed in the face of such a hopeless situation?

1000 meters away from the kingdom’s fortress, the allied forces’ army of 500,000 was waiting to take action with their accumulated strength. Before the fortress’s gate was opened, the cheers of the allied forces outside rang loudly like roaring thunder, sending chills down the spines of the 10,000 soldiers who could not even hold their weapons without trembling.

Joseph and the rest had already stood at the city wall of the fortress a long time ago, and they were alarmed by the sight of the 500,000 soldiers.

“That is the war flag of the Glorious Lion Knights.” Joseph frowned instinctively when he saw a war flag of a fierce lion in the enemy troops.

“There’s going to be a good show. With the Glorious Lion Knights in the war, Tang probably will not even last an hour with those 10,000 soldiers,” said another Kingdom Knight.

“His Majesty has already made back-up plans. If there isn’t enough time, another troop will replace them,” Joseph said.

Evidently, no one treated the troop of 10,000 soldiers seriously, and they all the more did not treat Ye Qingtang seriously either. They felt that Ye Qingtang was a complete good-for-nothing who would not even be capable of buying time.

The horn rang suddenly, and the gate of the kingdom’s fortress opened.

Equipped with armor, Ye Qingtang took the lead and charged out of the fortress on a horse.

Meanwhile, the 10,000 soldiers behind her felt their legs wobble as fear engulfed them instantly after seeing the allied forces’ 500,000 men troop.

This was it.

They were really dead this time.

Such few of them were not even enough to be an appetizer for the allied forces! Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

A fifty-times difference in military strength?

Apart from god, who else could win such a war!

After the ten thousand people exited the fortress, the gate was shut instantly, completely crushing their last hope of escaping.
