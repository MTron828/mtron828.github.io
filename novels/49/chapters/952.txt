Chapter 953 Return to Lin Town (4)

Si Bai was extremely intelligent but was born with a weak body. Fortunately, Ye Qingtang’s help had managed to turn the course of his illness around. However, Si Bai had suffered too many losses in the past decades. Hence, Master Si had arranged for Si Bai to travel a thousand miles away to somewhere where he could convalescence quietly, in hopes of speeding up his recovery.

Si Bai had been convalescing there for more than a year.

Ye Qingtang nodded when she heard Si Ye’s words.

As they were speaking, Master Si coughed repeatedly, and blood seeped from the corner of his mouth.

When he saw that, Si Ye’s expression changed.

Half a year ago, Master Si had been injured by a powerful cultivator from the Long Family. Although his injuries had healed, he was old, and it was unavoidable that some chronic ailments remained.

“Grandfather Si’s injury…” Ye Qingtang looked at Master Si and asked.

“Hmph, it’s all the doing of that Long Family and that Duan Family.” Master Si grunted coldly. When he mentioned the two families, he gritted his teeth in hatred.

“Long Family and Duan Family…” That was also Ye Qingtang’s guess, but she was somewhat surprised to hear it from Master Si.

“Ai…” Master Si sighed softly. “Tang Tang, you have left Lin Town for almost two years. There are many things that you don’t know about. A year ago, the Long Family moved into Lin Town. They were extremely domineering, and they exploited the Ye Family and the Si Family in many ways. We resisted a few times, and I was injured as a result.”

“The Long Family is just too powerful. Rumor has it that the head of the family is a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord… We are helpless in the face of such a powerful cultivator.” Si Ye’s face was filled with resignation.

Si Ye had intended to ask the City Lord of Fallen Stars City for help, but although they had sent many messages, they had not received a reply.

There was no news of Mu Su. It was as if he had disappeared into thin air.

Fortunately, the Long Family had not annexed the Si Family or the Ye Family. It was as if the Si and Ye families were beneath them. After all, in the eyes of the Long Family, these two families were as insignificant as ants.

“Grandfather Si, let me examine your injuries,” Ye Qingtang said to Master Si.

Master Si sighed when he heard that. “My injuries have healed, but they gave rise to chronic ailments that I am unable to recover from.”

Without saying anything else, Ye Qingtang stepped forward and used her primordial qi to examine his body.

Master Si’s injuries had indeed healed; it was just that the chronic ailments were deeply rooted. If they were not completely eradicated, he would not live for many more years.

“Grandfather, it’s nothing. Just rest for a few more days, and I’m sure you’ll be better.” Si Ye frowned as he spoke.

But Master Si shook his head at Si Ye’s words. “Si Ye, Grandfather is old but not senile. I am well aware of my own body. I’ll be lucky if I’m not dead within half a year. Now, Grandfather’s greatest wish is for our Si Family to be safe.”

Si Ye gritted his teeth and clenched his fists, but he did not say a word.

Of course, he knew about his grandfather’s condition.

Everyone knew that the Si Family’s Third Young Master, Si Bai, was physically weak. However, they did not know that Master Si’s health was now so poor. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

His grandfather’s chronic ailments had previously been suppressed by elixirs. But now, the elixirs available on the market had long lost their effectiveness, and his chronic ailments would flare up every half a month.

“Grandfather Si, I have an elixir.”

Ye Qingtang smiled and took out a fiery red healing elixir from her space ring.
