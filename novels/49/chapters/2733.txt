Chapter 2734: The Second Tian (5)

Tian…

“You… are Tian?!” Ye Qingtang widened her eyes at the big yellow dog in disbelief.

The big yellow dog shook its tail and stared at Ye Qingtang. “What do you know about Tian?”

“Are you… Tian or not?” Ye Qingtang asked in surprise.

Back then, when she entered the land of despair, she had met Tian. In fact, she had also seen Tian in the memory after entering the Fourth Domain’s legacy realm.

However, Tian was not a dog then. But the giant shadow just now…

“Forget it.”

The yellow dog stared at Ye Qingtang. “I am Misfortune.”

“Misfortune?” Ye Qingtang was confused.

“Take it that I used to be Tian,” the big yellow dog said, wagging its tail.

“Used to be… Tian!” Ye Qingtang was even more shocked. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Shi Tian is the current Tian while I am the previous one.” The big yellow dog looked at Ye Qingtang.

The big yellow dog explained everything to Ye Qingtang.

About the upper and lower realms.

When the world first appeared, the upper and lower realms were already distinctly separated.

The so-called upper realm where True Gods resided, was full of spirit energy. Meanwhile, the lower realm was where the Heavenly Demons resided, filled with filth.

The Heavenly Demons were unwilling to stay in the lower realm, so they fought with the True Gods. Even after countless battles across generations, they had failed to determine the victor.

Thereafter, the True Gods created the human race and taught them their cultivation methods. The primordial era was the golden age of the human race. There were countless supreme experts.

There were even some human experts whose strength had surpassed that of the True Gods. They hoped to go to the upper realm and flourish in my more powerful spirit energy.

Only, the True Gods didn’t agree, to the extent where they even issued a harsh punishment. This was the first time humans experienced such a terrible disaster.

After that, the Heavenly Demons reached an agreement with the human race to join forces and kill their way into the upper realm. The True Gods were no match for them and had no choice but to give half of the upper realm to the humans and the Heavenly Demons.

From then on, the human experts in the upper realm called themselves Perfected Immortals.

Millions of years later, a war between Perfected Immortals, True Gods and Heavenly Demons erupted. The Heavenly Demons crushed the True Gods with absolute dominance. In this battle, the Heavenly Demons also suffered heavy losses, giving rise to a great opportunity for the Perfected Immortals.

The Perfected Immortals attacked en masse, completely wiping out the Heavenly Demons and taking over the upper realm. And the one who led the Perfected Immortals in this battle was Chaos, the first Tian.

At that time, the Perfected Immortals and Heavenly Demons were almost wiped out. After millions of years, there was no longer any hostility between the races in the upper realm. More and more living beings cultivated divine bodies and entered the upper realm.

However, this semblance of peace did not last long. A magical beast appeared out of nowhere and controlled all races except humans. It terrorized the upper realm and was invincible.

Meanwhile, the first Tian had long fallen, which was why the seemingly invincible magical beast became the second Tian, known as Misfortune.

To prevent the living beings from the lower realm from surging into the upper realm and sucking the spirit energy, Misfortune created the Heavenly Tribulation. It also created a guardian with unmatched power, not giving any lower realm experts a chance to enter the upper realm.

This way of doing things was met with widespread approval in the upper realm.

It was because the more Perfected Immortals there were, the faster the spirit energy would be used up. If this continued, the upper realm would lose its prestigious status.

Meanwhile, the lower realm had become a prison.

Over the next tens of thousands of years, an extremely powerful Perfected Immortal appeared. His name was Shi Tian and he possessed the formidable Karma bloodline. He also possessed the terrifying Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline, which he used to challenge Misfortune.

Like that, Misfortune was defeated and Shi Tian became the third Tian.
