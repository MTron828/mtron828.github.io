Chapter 459: Unexpected Surprise (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Before Ye Qingtang could think it through, the yellow spirit root that just transformed suddenly radiated an extremely hot breath.

The breath spread like fire, rushing into every meridian inside her body.

“Argh!!!”

Even Ye Qingtang also groaned in pain.

The cold sweat on her head was dripping like pearls from a broken string. Ye Qingtang’s face was full of astonishment.

Ye Qingtang immediately wanted to direct her primordial qi to counter the pain that was brought by the heat radiated from the Spirit Life Flower.

However, that did not help at all and instead caused the breath to be even hotter as if she was surrounded by fire.

Hot flames suddenly arose on from her arm to her entire body.

“This is…” Ye Qingtang was shocked.

The flame engulfed her completely within a second and condensed into a sun-like shape.

A bright glow filled the entire cave.

“Ughhh”!

Under the light of the little sun, Ye Qingtang’s expression showed that she was suffering in agony. It seemed that she might melt at any time.

However, at the same moment, the Heart of the Demon God started beating. A ray of black light surrounded Ye Qingtang and protected her inside.

The unbearable pain was then slightly relieved, and Ye Qingtang regained her consciousness.

…

The little sun faded after two days.

At the same time, when Ye Qingtang opened her eyes, a streak of light suddenly shot out of her eyes.

Boom!

The light crushed the wall of the stone into a brown powder. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“The Paragon Skill… Rise of the Phoenix!” Ye Qingtang was stunned. She could not believe what had just happened.

The level of one’s spirit root was classified as red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and purple.

The so-called Paragon Skill was not an external martial skill. It was the only skill that could be understood from the spirit root.

Only cultivators with yellow spirit roots and above could understand their own Paragon Skills.

It was extremely rare for one to understand the Paragon Skill. Feng Moli was the only one in the Xuanling Sect who understood the Paragon Skill, and that was the reason why he was valued so high in the sect. It was obvious how precious the Paragon Skill was.

Ye Qingtang lifted her arm slightly. A flower constructed by a golden flame emerged on her palm. The heat immediately spread out like fire.

“This is…” Ye Qingtang still remained in shock.

“That’s weird… This does not look like the normal Rise of the Phoenix.” Ye Qingtang frowned as she could not understand the Paragon Skill that came from nowhere.

The normal Rise of the Phoenix stored some kind of energy in the body, but Ye Qingtang’s Rise of the Phoenix merged the energy into her meridians. Even her primordial qi was also affected, and the color changed from pure white to gold.

The Paragon Skill could never reach this level.

Furthermore, the Rise of the Phoenix came very suddenly, and she was almost killed in the flame. If the Heart of the Demon God had not protected her just now, she might have been burned alive under the heat of the Rise of the Phoenix. She had never heard that the Paragon Skill was so dangerous that one might lose their life…

“Unless…” Ye Qingtang seemed to realize something after a while. Her pupil contracted, and her face was filled with disbelief.

“Is it possible that this is not the normal Rise of the Phoenix but the Ultimate Origin Skill?!” Ye Qingtang was totally taken aback by this thought.
