“Miss Ye, since you want to protect this mainland, then that means you will not be leaving with me.” A while later, Ling Yan looked at Ye Qingtang meaningfully. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Ye Qingtang was a little dumbfounded. Even if this mainland did not need her protection, there was no need for her to leave with Ling Yan, was there…

“Since that’s the case, how about I stay to be with you?” Ling Yan suddenly asked with a laugh when he saw that Ye Qingtang did not speak.

“…” Ye Qingtang glared at Ling Yan and shook her head. “There’s no need.”

Given Ling Yan’s Martial Qi Level Three Third Heaven skills, it was too dangerous for him to remain in this mainland. Furthermore, not only did she have to face the ancient clan which was about to head over, she still had to settle some matters in Xuanling Sect and Falling Sky Valley. She had no time to take care of Ling Yan.

Although… she did not think that… Ling Yan really needed her care given his intelligence.

But… accidents existed. No one could promise that an accident would not happen.

Moreover, this incident had nothing to do with Ling Yan from the start.

Seeing that Ye Qingtang was determined, Ling Yan said, “Since that’s the case, please take care. I hope to see you in the Central Mainland.”

Afterward, Ling Yan cast Ye Qingtang a meaningful look before leaving with the little azure dragon. Right before he turned around to leave, a faint trace of a smile danced in the corners of his eyes, unbeknown to Ye Qingtang

There would be a day they would meet again.

He looked forward to the arrival of that day.

Watching the back view of Ling Yan as he left, Ye Qingtang looked down slightly and rid the strange feeling in her heart. Then, she turned around and headed in the direction of the Formidable Heavens Dynasty.

She still had many things to settle.

Those were the duties that she had to complete.

“Are you really not destroying this mainland?” The little azure dragon looked at Ling Yan in surprise.

Is Ling Yan going to change his plans just because of one sentence from Ye Qingtang?!

Ling Yan chuckled. “Is a sentence from Miss Ye not enough?”

“Ling Yan, it is not important whether that ancient clan of the Central Mainland can keep the Spiritual Abode or not. However… you should know that once the Heavenly Emperor knows that your body and Miss Ye are on this mainland, the consequences would be dire!” The little azure dragon said anxiously.

“Are you this certain that I am Han Cangming?” Ling Yan looked at the little azure dragon with a faint smile.

“A straightforward person does not use insinuations. I am not anyone else. You can dream of hiding your true identity from me…” Confidence was written all over the little azure dragon’s face. “Frankly speaking, you are the Demon God, Han Cangming, and there is no influence on you even if I know it or not.”

Ling Yan smiled after hearing the little azure dragon. “The azure dragon clan is indeed extremely intelligent.”

The True Dragon clan was the leader of the four great Fiendcelestial Beasts. However, there was more than one breed of dragons. For example, the Black Dragon clan specialized in massacre, Azure Dragon in intellect and astronomy, the Five-Clawed Golden Dragon in unparalleled power.

Although the little azure dragon had not yet matured, its current spiritual wisdom was already extraordinary.

“Just as you said, there is no influence on me regardless of whether you know it or not.” Ling Yan echoed with a smile.

“It’s best that you admit it. Let’s return to the topic then. I think that the wise choice is to use the power of the True Dragon’s inheritance to destroy this mainland. Your body appeared in this mainland before, and if you don’t destroy all traces of it, you will not be able to ensure the safety of your body once the Heavenly Emperor hears this!” the little azure dragon said sternly.
