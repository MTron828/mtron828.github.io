Chapter 2254: Legacy Place (4)

As the crowd had no idea how to open those doors, naturally they were forced to get Ye Qingtang’s assent.

Even then Ye Qingtang refused to answer, and if anything, her resolute silence whetted everyone’s appetite. Their earlier suspicion toward Ye Qingtang had now completely dispelled.

Ye Qingtang was well aware of the principle of reverse psychology.

If she had immediately asked them to enter those doors, they would be afraid to even put half a foot inside. But if she refused to let them in, they would become even more convinced of her words.

It was human nature for a person to think they were very smart. If she could make appropriate use of this kind of thinking, she would be able to achieve her result.

“Never mind then,” Ye Qingtang said in a low voice, “But I must warn you that after you all enter the doors, the moment the successor is chosen, the rest of you must immediately come out. Under no circumstances are you to disturb the passing on of the will.”

Everyone grew curious at Ye Qingtang’s words.

“Disturb? Mighty one, what do you mean by that?” Someone asked.

Ye Qingtang put on a stern manner. “The moment the fiendcelestial begins the inheritance process, it will not stop. If anyone disturbs it, the inheritance will go into disarray. None of you will be able to bear the consequences if the chosen one is unable to take on all of the fiendcelestial’s will.”

It was a harsh warning by Ye Qingtang. But the crowd didn’t feel that way after hearing her words. If anything, the minds of Elder Feng and the rest immediately raced a million miles a minute.

Once the inheritance process started, it could not be stopped? And according to this black-robed person, the inheritance of the will would go into disarray if the process was disturbed?

Everyone at present were intelligent beings. Their minds raced with all sorts of thoughts and ideas.

Did this mean they could obtain the fiendcelestial’s will themselves if they killed the destined one?

Within just a few seconds, all the factions had this same idea. The formerly harmonious and peaceful atmosphere suddenly turned tense and quietly malicious.

It was apparent that the destined one was amongst them. As long as they could all enter, the inheritance process would begin. By then, as long as they kill off the other factions, they would be able to obtain the fiendcelestial’s legacy?

But they had to confirm the black-robed person’s words first.

The crowd didn’t reveal their ambitions. Only by entering the door would they be able to confirm if Ye Qingtang was speaking the truth.

Ye Qingtang quietly observed the crowd’s reaction before she continued. “Are you ready?”

“Yes, Mighty One.”

Ye Qingtang nodded and walked to the first door. Secretly, she had the Night Soul Beast activate the opening mechanism.

The massive door suddenly opened and an intense demon energy surged out.

It was an illusory space, and inside floated the fiendcelestial’s mind. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Elder Feng felt his heart shudder at the sight. He glanced at Ye Qingtang to make sure she had no objections to them stepping forward. Even so, he was still careful to let those around him enter first.

The other factions each dispatched one person to enter first. After those men entered and walked for some distance, they suddenly stopped.

“…This… is this the voice of the fiendcelestial? Legacy… destined one… ha…” One of the men suddenly smiled. He muttered to himself and those keywords were overheard by everyone!

The black-robed person was speaking the truth!

This was really the Legacy Place!

The fiendcelestial’s will…

In a flash, the various factions charged toward the door. No one wanted to miss this golden opportunity.
