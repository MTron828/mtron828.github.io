If these “sculptures” were handed over to some ordinary faction in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain, their combat strength would probably be instantly boosted to that of a first-tier faction.

It had to be said that the Dragon Emperor Clan was truly too overwhelming. The entire mountain range was the territory of the Dragon Emperor Clan. Within that was the Pill Chamber, the Divine Armory, the Martial Arts Area, and countless other facilities.

Even those top academies in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain who had very comprehensive campuses would probably still be way inferior to the Dragon Emperor Clan’s territory.

Before long, the middle-aged man brought Ye Qingtang to the guest room area at the elder’s instruction.

...

“Miss Ye, these guest rooms are spacious and clean. Your friend is resting in a room on the north side. You can choose one as you like,” the middle-aged man explained.

“These guest rooms are all empty… Are there no other guests in the Dragon Emperor Clan?” Ye Qingtang asked instinctively.

“Hehe, Miss Ye, the Dragon Emperor Clan doesn’t have many guests. In the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain, there aren’t many people who are qualified to be our guests. Some people might be qualified, but they do not dare to come here.” The middle-aged man chuckled.

Ye Qingtang had a general understanding of the Dragon Emperor Clan’s way of doing things. This middle-aged man was telling the truth. Who would dare to come to the Dragon Emperor Clan as a guest? It was a major evil faction in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain.

“Alright, Miss Ye, as I told you before, don’t leave the guest room area without permission. Someone will bring some food and water over for you.” After giving his instructions, the middle-aged man made to leave.

“Senior…” Ye Qingtang suddenly called out to the middle-aged man.

The middle-aged man turned to look at Ye Qingtang and said, “Miss Ye, what other questions do you have?”

“Hmm… nothing much, I’m just curious. I heard just now that… the children of Princess Jiu have been found by the Dragon Emperor Clan?” Ye Qingtang pondered for a moment before deciding to ask. It would be best if she could find out, but she would not mind if she could not.

“Miss Ye, why are you asking about this?”

The middle-aged man frowned slightly. No outsider was allowed to ask about the direct bloodline descendants, especially in the extremely strict Dragon Emperor Clan.

“To be honest, I’m a little curious about Princess Di Jiuyuan,” Ye Qingtang said with a smile.

The middle-aged man did not speak. He sized up Ye Qingtang for a long time before saying, “Miss Ye, there are some things that you can ask about but some that you cannot. If you don’t know which is which, it’s best not to ask at all. Do you understand what I mean?” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Ye Qingtang pondered over this. In the end, she nodded and smiled. “I will remember your advice, Senior. I will not speak of it anymore.”

“Alright, Miss Ye, rest early.” The middle-aged man did not stay any longer and turned to leave.

After the middle-aged man left, Ye Qingtang casually chose a room and entered.

The guest room of the Dragon Emperor Clan was extremely luxurious. There was an indescribable charm to it. In fact, the table was filled with extremely rare delicacies. If consumed by warriors, it could strengthen the muscles and bones.. There were even many rare medicinal pills placed on the table in bottles.
