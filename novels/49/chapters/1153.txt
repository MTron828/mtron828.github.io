Chapter 1154: Pagoda Sword Master (3)

“It may not be so.” The Ultimate Elder suddenly looked up and gazed afar.

Almost at the same time when Ultimate Elder looked over, a “wave” seemed to appear in the air.

In just the blink of an eye, numerous black shadows appeared from that “wave”.

Those black shadows transformed into bolts of light and descended from the sky unannounced.

The masses from the three mighty forces—Phantom Valley, Peerless School, and Beiming Manor—suddenly appeared in everyone’s sight!

“Greetings, Ultimate Elder!”

Three tall figures stood out from the three mighty forces.

The Masters of Phantom Valley, Peerless School, and Beiming Manor immediately walked forward and greeted Ultimate Elder with a bow and cupped fists upon seeing him.

“Mhm.”

Ultimate Elder waved a hand briefly in response.

Ultimate Elder was a legendary powerful figure on this mainland, and even the three mighty forces were extremely respectful toward him.

Ye Qingtang had a look of understanding when she saw the arrival of the three mighty forces.

Currently, the invasion of the Central Mainland powerful figures into this mainland was a pressing crisis, and the Peerless School, Phantom Valley, and Beiming Manor would not sit around and do nothing.

The three mighty forces must be aware of the current situation and the You Ancient Clan’s intentions.

If they did not stop the You Ancient Clan’s massacre, the three mighty forces would also ultimately vanish along with everyone on this mainland.

They were not fools. No egg was left intact when the nest was doomed.

Regardless of their dynamics previously, they could only join forces now.

“Senior Ultimate Elder… This is…”

Beiming Manor Chief looked at Pagoda Sword Master and asked curiously.

“Pagoda Sword Master,” replied Ultimate Elder.

Pagoda Sword Master?!

Their expressions changed when they heard this name.

The Pagoda Sword Master had left this mainland a long time ago, and barely anyone knew what he looked like. The power-holders of the three mighty forces had never seen the Pagoda Sword Master before either.

Although they had not met the Pagoda Sword Master before, he was extremely esteemed and renowned.

Legend has it that the Pagoda Sword Master was the number one figure of this mainland, and even the Blood Moon Holy Lord back then was defeated by him…

They heard that the Pagoda Sword Master had left this mainland a long time ago, yet unexpectedly today… the Pagoda Sword Master actually returned to this mainland when it was facing a crisis…

The addition of the three mighty forces resulted in ten plus Yang Lords on the Pagoda Sword Master’s side.

Yet despite this situation, Ye Qingtang was not seen to be relieved at all, and she looked at the frowning Ultimate Elder.

As expected, the Ultimate Elder had a somber expression as he looked at the You Ancient Clan masses.

Even with additional support, the Ultimate Elder was still distressed.

While the three mighty forces joined in, the You Ancient Clan was much more powerful than he expected, and it was probably tough to contend against them even if the full force of the three mighty forces participated. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

If… the hidden ancient clan of this mainland could join them, perhaps there was a tiny hope in this battle.

“Haha, aren’t you all being delusional for wanting to protect this mainland with just a few of you?” The golden-robed elderly of the You Ancient Clan snickered.
