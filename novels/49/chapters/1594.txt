Chapter 1595 Brutal Little Fellow 2

“Your performance on the battlefield was extremely stunning. May I know if you’re a citizen of the Supreme League Kingdom?” General Mark asked straight to the point.

He did not have any more time. While the allied forces retreated temporarily, this was only their first wave of attack, and General Mark was very clear that this night was destined to be a sleepless one—the allied forces definitely would not give up on the invasion so easily, and the bugle call for the second wave would sound very soon.

General Mark needed to confirm the background of this mysterious girl as soon as possible. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Ye Qingtang looked at General Mark’s anxious expression and replied. “Yes.”

Almost instantly, General Mark heaved a clear sigh of relief, and the smile on his face deepened.

“Friend, tonight’s war was all thanks to your help. I knew that the citizens of the Supreme League Kingdom were not craven and cowardly. The allied forces have launched a sneak attack on us today, and the number of guards that we have may not be able to stop their plan. My dear friend, are you willing to play a part in protecting our town by helping us resist the allied forces’ invasion?” General Mark looked at Ye Qingtang solemnly. After witnessing this girl’s ability for himself, he was increasingly certain that he required her help.

“If you’re willing to help us to overcome this crisis, I believe the people in the town would be extremely grateful for your bravery.” He added on.

“Sure.” Ye Qingtang agreed to General Mark’s request without any hesitation.

Smiles almost flooded out from General Mark’s eyes. “May I know what your name is?”

Ye Qingtang replied. “You can call me Tang.”

“Tang? What a nice name.” General Mark smiled.

Almost right after their conversation ended, a piercing bugle call rang from outside, and a guard rushed in hurriedly.

“General Mark, this is bad! The allied forces are launching an attack again, and the Glorious Lion Knights are leading the battle this time!”

“Glorious Lion Knights!” General Mark frowned instantly at the sound of this name.

What he was most worried about still happened eventually.

“Is there anything special about the Glorious Lion Knights?” Ye Qingtang sensed General Mark’s abnormality and asked curiously.

Seeing that Ye Qingtang was so young, General Mark struggled for a moment and did not dare to lie to her. “Tang, the Glorious Lion Knights is one of the five great elite forces of the allied forces and is the trump army of the Qin Dragon Kingdom. They once wiped out a troop of 10,000 soldiers with just 1,000 of them, and each one of them is extremely powerful and brave...”

General Mark’s expression turned ugly. “When I saw the Glorious Lion Knights flag just now, I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me. Logically speaking, a force like the Glorious Lion Knights should be at the other battlefields, but unexpectedly... They actually came here. I’m afraid the allied forces are determined to conquer this place.”

At this moment, General Mark’s good mood from inviting Ye Qingtang to participate in the battle vanished completely. He was very worried that this petite girl would withdraw after hearing what he said, but he realized that her clean face seemed to remain emotionless. It was as though she completely did not realize the power of the Glorious Lion Knights.
