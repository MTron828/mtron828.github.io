Chapter 1076 Am I Afraid?

“Peerless School?” When she heard that, Ye Qingtang’s eyelids drooped. The corners of her mouth curved in a small smile. “What about Peerless School? I don’t even care about the Formidable Heavens Dynasty’s Beiming Manor. There are two Beiming Manor Yang Lords out to kill me, but I have already killed one of them. I’m not even afraid of the Beiming Manor, so why should I be afraid of the Peerless School?”

“You… killed a Yang Lord from the Beiming Manor?!”

The Peerless School warden was taken aback by Ye Qingtang’s words.

In this mainland, the three biggest powers each had four Yang Lords. This kept things in balance so that they were on equal footing. But if one of the powers lost a Yang Lord, then the balance of power among the three would be lost… Either the Peerless School or the Phantom Valley could attack the power that had lost a Yang Lord. The outcome of a fight between four Yang Lords and three Yang Lords could be imagined.

“I still have some internal matters to settle in the Falling Sky Valley today. I don’t have time to bandy words with you. Scram!” The warmth in Ye Qingtang’s eyes had swiftly faded.

The warden of the Peerless School just needed to bring back the news that the Beiming Manor had lost a Yang Lord.

“Humph!”

The Peerless School warden scoffed coldly. He immediately rose and led the Peerless School disciples out of the great hall and into the Falling Sky Valley without a backward glance.

As the Peerless School warden left, Ye Qingtang’s gaze fell on the two Peak Masters of Cut Water Peak and Blue Cloud Peak.

At that moment, the two Peak Masters were struck dumb. They did not even dare to breathe loudly.

Who would have thought that Perfected Xuanchen’s disciple, Ye Chen, had now… appeared in the Falling Sky Valley as a Yang Lord? If they had known about this, they would never have dared to collude with Full Moon Peak.

“From now on, you are stripped of your positions as Masters of Blue Cloud Peak and Cut Water Peak. You are expelled from Falling Sky Valley.” Ye Qingtang looked at them and said calmly.

“You… why…”

The two of them were shocked.

“Why?” Ye Qingtang’s expression seemed imbued with a trace of bone-chilling frost. Her gaze swept over them inch by inch. “You colluded with the Full Moon Peak to do such underhanded things. Have you forgotten about them? You have better vanish forever from my sight before I change my mind. I won’t repeat myself.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

When they heard Ye Qingtang’s words, the Blue Cloud Peak and Cut Water Peak Masters were so frightened that they were soaked in cold sweat. They did not dare to speak anymore and immediately got up. They only wished they had been born with a few more legs. They swiftly fled and vanished without a trace.

It was all too easy for a Yang Lord to kill martial cultivators of their level. With just a thought, they could be smashed into smithereens and transformed into nothingness.

As she looked at the two of them flee, Ye Qingtang resumed her original appearance. She looked at the shocked Perfected Xuanchen, and the sharp look in her eyes completely faded and was replaced with gentle

amusement.“Master, are you pleased with this conclusion?”

“Are you… really Ye Chen?!”

Perfected Xuanchen felt as if he was in a dream. He could not imagine how Ye Chen, who was clearly a male, could now become a female, especially one with terrifying powers of the cultivation of a Yang Lord…

“Master, I was originally a girl, but when I first came to Falling Sky Valley, I had no choice but to present myself to others as Ye Chen,” explained Ye Qingtang.

“I see…”

When Perfected Xuanchen heard Ye Qingtang’s explanation, he realized that Ye Chen was Ye Qingtang’s false name.

“So… What is your real name?” Perfected Xuanchen asked Ye Qingtang.

“Ye Qingtang.” She answered honestly.
