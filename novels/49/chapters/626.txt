Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas StudiosWhen Ye Qingtang saw that the little white tiger could not help but reveal a sorrowful expression upon mentioning its parents, she sighed softly and rubbed its furry chin.

“F*ck you. I’m not a dog.” The little white tiger’s hair stood up immediately after being teased by the Ye Qingtang, and its face was full of protest.

“No cursing…” Ye Qingtang berated.

“F*ck you…” the little white tiger said.

“…”

Ye Qingtang realized that she really did not know how to deal with the tiger after she signed the equality contract with this Fiendcelestial Beast, and it was not right for her to hit it as she wished. Since it liked to curse, then let it be.

“Who did you learn this from?” Ye Qingtang was a little curious.

“My father!” the little white tiger said. “My father scolds other Fiendcelestial Beast like this. Those Fiendcelestial Beasts did not even dare to retort, unlike you who even dared to hit me. F*ck you.”

“So that’s why.” Ye Qingtang finally understood.

This little white tiger’s cursing was probably just a form of yearning for its father.

However, it was just displayed through an exceptionally special method.

“Oh right.” The little white tiger suddenly thought of something and told Ye Qingtang. “The opening of this Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm is the deliberate act of two people. One of them is very young while the other is completely wrapped in a wide black robe, and I can’t see his face clearly. Since you’re in this mystic realm, you must be more careful.”

“Black-robed person…” Ye Qingtang pondered.

That black-robed person had already appeared in the palace hall. He used an array formation which wiped out dozens of powerful figures from super sects. Only she and the Blood Moon Elder escaped using the talisman along with the Yuehua Sect Master, who also successfully escaped, while all of the remaining people died.

As for the young man that the little white tiger said, Ye Qingtang had no memory of him at all.

Until now, Ye Qingtang still did not understand why the mysterious black-robed person told her about the Space-Transfer Talisman at the critical moment. If the black-robed person did not say anything, she and the Blood Moon Elder would have also died in the palace.

Before Ye Qingtang said anything, there was a violent vibration in the sky ahead of them.

Extremely far away, a shadow of a large palace ascended into the sky. Below the palace, a lady slowly walked on the steps and walked to the palace.

“Ye You…”

A cold glint flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes when she saw the lady who was about to enter the palace in the sky.

“The land of inheritance in this Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm…” The little white tiger clicked his tongue. “That lady’s luck is not bad. She actually found an inheritance in this dangerous mystic realm. She is really lucky.”

“What inheritance is that?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“One of the best inheritances on this mainland. Why? You have a grudge against that lady?” The little white tiger looked at Ye Qingtang with a strange expression.

“She… once dug my spirit root away,” Ye Qingtang answered honestly.

“F*ck her!” After hearing that, the little white tiger swore loudly. “Spirit roots are the foundation of cultivators. That slut dug your spirit root? That means she was simply wanting your life. I can still understand if that slut did not pay attention to you, but she actually did not attach importance to me?! How dare it bully my person!”

“…”

“Hmph!” The little white tiger scoffed coldly. “That inheritance is not the best in the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm. I know where the best inheritance is. What’s the big deal if she can find that inheritance? I can bring you to find an even better one!”
