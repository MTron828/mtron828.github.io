Chapter 1231 How Did I Put This On? (2)

With that kind of power, all they had to do was twitch their fingers, and both of them would be crushed.

“Do you think that I don’t want to leave?” Ye Qingtang heaved a wordless sigh. When she was in the main hall just now, she had felt as if she was sitting on a carpet of pins. How she longed to escape from this place.

Just as Ye Qingtang was fretting, some noise suddenly came from her voice transmission stone. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Miss Ye.” Ling Yan’s laughing voice slowly came from the voice transmission stone.

“Ling Yan?” Ye Qingtang was slightly taken aback. Ling Yan had not contacted her for a long time.

“Miss Ye, are you getting used to the Central Mainland?” Ling Yan’s voice held a trace of amusement.

“You knew that I’m back?” asked Ye Qingtang.

“I have always been concerned about Miss Ye’s affairs.”

“…” Ye Qingtang remained silent. But then she thought of something and said, “Ling Yan, what do you know about the Temple of Shadows?”

“Temple of Shadows? Why is Miss Ye suddenly asking about the Temple of Shadows? Thousands of years ago, the Temple of Shadows represented the height of the Undead’s power. But in the last few thousand years, it has sunk into obscurity. Rumor has it that their Holy Lord suddenly vanished, so they began to withdraw their influence. Even so, the Temple of Shadows has long been a very dangerous place,” said Ling Yan. “What if I told you… that I am now in the Temple of Shadows?” said Ye Qingtang.

Silence fell on the other end of the voice transmission stone.

Ye Qingtang knew that Ling Yan was intelligent, so she told him how she had been mistakenly brought to the Temple of Shadows and posed as the Holy Lord. She hoped that Ling Yan would have some way to help her escape.

However…

Quiet laughter came from the voice transmission stone.

Ye Qingtang’s brows immediately wrinkled. “You’re still in the mood for laughter? If I’m discovered, who knows how I’ll die?”

Ling Yan burst into laughter again, but just as Ye Qingtang was so infuriated that she wanted to turn off the voice transmission stone, he said, “Miss Ye does not need to worry. Since the Undead of the Temple of Shadows think you’re their Holy Lord and since you look just like the Holy Lord, all you have to do is to temporarily maintain the status quo. There is no need to worry about anything else.”He said it so casually…

Ye Qingtang was speechless. “But if Miss Ye is truly worried, then she can just leave. Considering how much the Undead of the Temple of Shadows respects the Holy Lord, they will not make things difficult for Miss Ye. But… Miss Ye had better not reveal her identity,” said Ling Yan. “Of course I will not reveal my identity.” Ye Qingtang sighed again. As if she would dare to do that?!

“Since Miss Ye is now connected to the Temple of Shadows, she can make use of that. Although the Temple of Shadows is not as powerful as it once was, it is not to be underestimated. The Holy Son, Ming Gu, is a mutant Undead. He is extremely powerful and is absolutely loyal to the Holy Lord. If Miss Ye uses this opportunity well, perhaps it will help Miss Ye attain her own goals,” said Ling Yan.

Her own goals…

Ye Qingtang sank into deep thought.

So Ling Yan had guessed the reason behind her coming to Central Mainland.

The empty mainland surfaced in her mind, completely quiet and desolate. The Ancient You Clan was so powerful. Although she intended to snatch little You Yun from them, it would naturally be good if she could obtain more help. She did not yet know if the Temple of Shadows would be a blessing or a curse…

“The Holy Lord of the Temple of Shadows is not only powerful but also has many Dharma treasures. Miss Ye can borrow a few of them.” Ling Yan continued.
