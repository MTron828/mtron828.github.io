Chapter 1239: Authentic Or Fake (1)

Ling Yan chuckled. “It will be very difficult for Miss Ye to single-handedly take on the Ancient You Clan.”

“So this was all part of your plan?” The little azure dragon widened its eyes slightly. Ling Yan was truly brilliant to be able to manipulate people so precisely from a thousand miles away.

Ling Yan laughed but did not reply.

In the Temple of Shadows, Ye Qingtang had returned to her sleeping chambers. But the moment she recalled the events of the Hall of Gloom, she felt terrified again. If Ling Yan had not known the incantation of blessing, Ye Qingtang would have been exposed there and then.

When she thought about it, Ye Qingtang could not help but take out the voice transmission stone.

“Ling Yan.”

“Yes, I’m here.” Ling Yan’s rather indolent voice rang out from the voice transmission stone.

“Thank you,” said Ye Qingtang.

Ling Yan chuckled. “If Miss Ye really wants to thank me, why not marry me?”

Ye Qingtang was just beginning to feel a little touched, but Ling Yan’s words immediately dispelled her emotions.

Marry him? As if!

“Miss Ye has merely lulled the suspicions of Ming Wang and the tribe leaders. But in order to completely dispel their suspicions, Miss Ye needs to begin imitating some of the Holy Lord’s behavior in the Temple of Shadows…” Ling Yan changed the subject.

Ye Qingtang grew serious.

“I don’t know much about the Holy Lord of the Temple of Shadows.”

“Miss Ye only needs to listen to me. The Holy Lord of the Temple of Shadows is unpredictable. She usually shows a smiling face to everyone…” Ling Yan slowly introduced Ye Qingtang to some of the behaviors of the Holy Lord of the Temple of Shadows.

The Holy Lord of the Temple of Shadows used to be supremely powerful in this mainland. Although she had the appearance of a slender girl, no one dared to offend her in the least.

What was most terrifying about the Holy Lord was her capricious nature. Although she was always smiling, she killed without blinking an eye.

Even when she was attacked by powerful figures from the Second Domain, she had chatted and laughed while carrying out a bloody slaughter.

Many secretly called her the Smiling God of Death.

As Ye Qingtang carefully listened to Ling Yan’s synopsis, she got the general idea.

After speaking to Ling Yan for a while, the two broke off their connection.

In just one short day, Ye Qingtang had experienced a severe shock. In a powerful place like the Temple of Shadows, a single slip would lead to death. What was even more frightening was that Ming Wang and the tribe leaders had begun to suspect her. One misstep and she was dead.

If possible, Ye Qingtang wished to escape as quickly as possible. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

But given the present circumstances, she was unable to leave.

She had no choice but to slowly dispel their doubts to save herself.

In the Temple of Shadows, Ming Wang was standing in the empty main hall, looking at the black bone throne. His face was expressionless.

In the gloom, an image seemed to appear on the black bone throne.

Ming Wang’s expression flickered.

There was a sound of soft footsteps. Ming Wang suddenly raised his hand, and with a wave, the image on the black bone throne vanished completely.

“Holy Son.” A stooped old man walked over slowly. He was wearing a large black cape, but white bones on his back pierced the cape and could be seen from the outside.

“What did the human say?” Ming Wang turned to look at the old man.

The old man was the Master of the Hall of Justice in the Temple of Shadows. He specialized in various forms of torture. He had millions of ways to open the most tight-lipped mouths.
