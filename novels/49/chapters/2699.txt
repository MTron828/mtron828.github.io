Chapter 2700: Silver Star Holy Lord (1)

Everyone’s expressions changed at this sudden turn of events. The tremendous pressure was like that of a Perfected Immortal or Buddha.

It was suffocating.

“Immortal Buddha bloodline…”

Standing under the golden Buddha palm, the power of the Immortal Buddha bloodline that had been long hidden in her body flowed into Ye Qingtang’s blood in that instant.

With the activation of her Immortal Buddha bloodline, the oppressive aura disappeared. In fact, Ye Qingtang could even calmly watch the supreme Buddha palm pressing down.

“Be careful!”

At the side, Wan Rong’s expression was anxious. She grabbed Ye Qingtang and made to escape.

However, the speed of the Buddha Palm was too fast. No matter how fast Ye Qingtang and Wan Rong were, they were still too slow.

Boom!!

A loud boom spread throughout the entire venue and exploded like muffled thunder, pounding at everyone’s eardrums. Dust flew everywhere and an indescribably huge pit was created in the ground by the Buddha Palm. Golden lightning crisscrossed the surface of the pit. Its power was even more terrifying than that of a Heavenly Tribulation.

“This…”

Currently, Wan Rong and Ye Qingtang were standing in the deep pit. The Buddha’s palm has passed through them without any effect. The palm looked invincible but it just passed through their bodies without any substantial damage.

“Illusion…” Ye Qingtang muttered.

“Junior Sister Ye Yue, you mean that nothing in this illusory realm can harm us?” Wan Rong asked Ye Qingtang.

“Senior Sister Wan Rong, the Fourth Domain no longer exists. Everything here should be just a memory of the legacy owner. Even if he used a heaven-defying divine power to preserve and seal his memories in his Deity Ocean, it will not pose any threat to us,” Ye Qingtang explained.

“This power… is the first time in my life that I’ve felt it. Even though everything is fake… The power is overwhelming and feels extremely real.” One of the Great Immortal Temple disciples looked at Ye Qingtang with lingering fear.

Just now, when the huge Buddha Palm was pressing down, the disciples all thought that they were going to die. They did not expect to end up unharmed.

“Everything is just an illusion. No need to panic.” Zhang Chi chuckled.

Several piercing sounds rang out in the air.

In the next second, several Daoists and men dressed as monks slowly landed in the deep pit. Their feet did not touch the ground as they floated in mid-air. Their clothes fluttered in the wind as the supreme aura of an Immortal Buddha assaulted their faces.

“These people… all have the Immortal Buddha bloodline.” Ye Qingtang pondered as she stared at the people in front of her.

Now Ye Qingtang was even more certain now that this was the Fourth Domain.

The Immortal Buddha bloodline was unique to the Fourth Domain. It was also the noblest bloodline in the Fourth Domain. She was considered an anomaly.

“Strange.”

One of the Daoists stood with his hands behind his back. His ink-black long hair cascaded to his waist. There was a silver star between his brows. His face was extremely beautiful and his every move was extremely dignified. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Holy Lord, what now?”

A young monk was staring at the Holy Lord with the silver star between his brows.
