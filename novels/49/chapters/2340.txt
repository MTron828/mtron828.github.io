Chapter 2341: Try It Out Yourself (1)

Di Nuo went on and reprimanded, “He is your teacher so of course you would say that. But I have to ask, how did a Paragon Sixth Heaven level manage to produce five Divine Lord stage students in just a few months? And Yun Chen, you know very well what you used to be like. Ye Qing is still so young. What? Don’t tell me he also studied alchemy? He was the one who taught you the palm flame?”

Di Nuo’s words cleared the confusion of many students. They stared suspiciously at Ye Qing.

It was not that there were no good teachers in this world.

But…

They had also found it very unbelievable when they first heard that Ye Qing had produced five Divine Lord stage students. After all, he had not been with Qin Feng and the others for long. Before he came, apart from Qin Feng, they had never even heard of their names before.

But now, they had all ascended the Divine Lord stage.

That alone was fine.

Today was even more incredible.

Now even Yun Chen, his lone alchemy student, managed to refine an elixir who was even better than Song Yanhan’s!

If this was real, Ye Qing was probably not human, right?

Only a god would be able to perform such miracles!

Sometimes, miraculous things would cause amazement. But there was still a limit.

It was clear that Ye Qing’s six students had far surpassed the limits of what these people could accept. They were so powerful that it was truly hard for them to believe.

And the worst thing was, Ye Qing was not powerful himself and was still quite young. How on earth did he manage to produce these six students?

Let alone over such a short period.

If this was all real, weren’t the rest of the Netherworld Academy people just a bunch of useless idiots? They had been cultivating hard for over a dozen years, but couldn’t compare to just a few months under Ye Qing?

Yun Chen’s smile had faded, and a harsh glint surfaced in his eyes. Lei Yan and the rest also looked similarly grim.

Just because their Boss was still young and didn’t have a high cultivation level, did this mean they could just make such wild accusations and insult him?

The teenagers were incensed but Ye Qing suddenly spoke up. “So it seems like Teacher Di Nuo doesn’t believe I was the one who taught them.”

Di Nuo put on an arrogant “that’s right” expression.

“Teacher Zhu is of the same opinion?” Ye Qing looked at Zhu Ning.

Although Zhu Ning didn’t speak his face showed that he agreed with Ye Qing’s question.

“Boss, let’s go. This shitty Netherworld Academy, we don’t need this place!” Lei Yan gritted his teeth. They were all so arrogant that he had already lost all interest in being in this school. If not for the fact that he had been so scared of being kicked out and enduring a beating from his father, he would have fled long ago!

Now, these people were insulting their Boss right in front of them.

This was unbearable!

There was no need to stay in such a terrible place!

“Di Nuo, let me tell you, our Boss is several thousand times better than you. You will never be able to compare to him in this life, in your next life, or even in your next next life! You can’t produce good students yourself and yet you want to stop our Boss from teaching? Just you wait, I will settle this score with you one day!” Lei Yan was livid.

He already noticed that Di Nuo didn’t like Ye Qing and was always purposely stirring trouble for him. While he was no match for Di Nuo now but there would come a day in the future when he would take revenge for his Boss.

“Boss, let’s go. We don’t care about staying in this academy.” Yun Chen took a deep breath before speaking. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He had enough of these people degrading Ye Qing like this. No matter what they said, no one would believe them. These people had always looked down on their Boss.
