Chapter 893 The Heart of the Heavenly Dao

“What did you know from the elder?” The little azure dragon looked at the little white tiger and asked.

The little white tiger contemplated for a while and said, “In the primordial mortal world, there was a genius who was born in the First Domain. The genius became the ultimate powerful person that no one could compare with. By coincidence, the Heavenly Dao decided to find the new inheritor and pass on the Inheritance of the Heavenly Dao. I suppose that the genius successfully inherited that and became the new Heavenly Dao. However, the inheritance of the Heavenly Dao he got was not complete, and he came out with a strategy. He took out the Heart of the Heavenly Dao and tried to find a suitable body to nurture the heart… The Heavenly Emperor was the first body, and the Demon God Han Cangming was the second…”

The little azure dragon smiled and said, “However, based on Han Cangming’s intelligence, he predicted that he would be the next body to nurture the heart through the interaction with the Heavenly Emperor. Thus, he left his body and became Ling Yan.”

“That’s right. The body had become the vessel for the Heart of the Heavenly Dao long ago. The body does not have a soul or mind, and it instinctively treats the Heart of the Heavenly Dao as his own heart…” The little white tiger nodded and said.

“So, Ye Qingtang is the third body for the Heart of the Heavenly Dao?” The little azure dragon murmured.

“It’s should be the situation now. The guide is the consciousness of the Heart of the Heavenly Dao. It intends to unite the new body with the second body. The Demon God will then facilitate Ye Qingtang till she’s powerful enough to nurture the Heart of the Heavenly Dao.”

“When she’s powerful enough, the person behind will then kill her and take back the Heart of the Heavenly Dao…” The little azure dragon’s eyes sparkled.

“I’m afraid so. And this is the reason why I totally oppose the Guide and oppose Ye Qingtang to unite with that body. However, I cannot tell her directly.” The little white tiger nodded continuously and said.

“You’re afraid that it will make the situation worse,” the little azure dragon said.

“Yes, if the situation gets worse, the consequences will be unimaginable. It will be a death calamity that she cannot escape from. She has to discover that by herself. Furthermore, our assumptions may not be completely right,” the little white tiger said.

“Bullshit! That’s my assumption. You heard that from someone else.” The little azure dragon stared at the little white tiger and said. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“F*ck you, I don’t even need to use my brain. Someone will tell me everything,” the little white tiger said arrogantly.

“Then let me ask you, what’s the identity of the elder who told you everything?” the little azure dragon asked.

“Hmm, I’m not sure as well. I asked him before, but he said that it’s a secret that could not be revealed.” The little white tiger contemplated for a while and said.

“Then I’m curious why would he just tell you about all these things. What are his intentions?” The little azure dragon paused and then asked.

“No, it’s impossible. I have known him for a long time. If he really had any intention, why would he even bother to tell me about all of this? Furthermore, he’s very powerful. If he wanted to kill us, he doesn’t need to plan anything.” The little white tiger was very certain.

“That makes sense as well,” The little azure dragon said.

“Oh right, doesn’t Ling Yan want to take back the power from the body?” The little white tiger was slightly curious.

“He will never do that. He refuses to admit his identity. Furthermore, if he takes back his power, the death calamity will definitely notice that. That’s why he left his body in order to trick everyone. It’s the Demon God’s style to hide in the dark and plan everything.” The little azure dragon sighed and said.
