Chapter 909 Demon-Like Intelligence (2)

“Although that noble’s skills are not powerful, as a noble heir of the Feng clan, he definitely had the means to protect his life and launch a deadly strike. In that case, your Karma Diversion was put to use, where you made use of the deadly strike from the noble heir of the Feng clan to help you obtain the inheritance of the True Dragon. Am I right?” The little azure dragon looked at Ling Yan with burning eyes. The more it speculated, the more it was overcome with emotion.

How intelligent is this Ling Yan exactly?

He really possessed a demon-like intelligence!

“You are very smart too,” Ling Yan said with a smile. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Ling Yan, oh Ling Yan. From the moment you asked Miss Ye to deal with Perfected Gu Yun, you have already schemed everything. You are in control of the entire situation, have an incredible foresight, and are extremely shrewd… Tsk tsk, you have my admiration.” The little azure dragon remarked sincerely. Probably no one in this world could fully grasp Ling Yan’s plan.

“However, Ling Yan, no matter how intelligent you are, I can guess of whatever you think of as well.” The little azure dragon spoke once again before Ling Yan could speak.

“Mhm.” Ling Yan nodded and said. “But it’s a pity that you missed out some things.”

The little azure dragon was alarmed when it heard what Ling Yan said and immediately shook its head. “Missed out some things?! How can it be? How would I miss anything out!”

Ling Yan looked at the little azure dragon and chuckled. “In your opinion, what would the Jiang clan do when I helped Miss Ye to teach Ye You, the granddaughter of the Domain Master Jiang Duantian, a lesson?”

Although the little azure dragon did not know why Ling Yan suddenly mentioned this, it still replied. “I’m afraid you will be in great danger. Given your martial skills cultivation…”

“Since that’s the case, what will happen if the Feng clan and the Jiang family fought?” Ling Yan questioned again.

“The Jiang family and the Feng clan?” The little azure dragon was a little puzzled. “The two ancient clans are extremely powerful. Although there are some minor conflicts usually, how could such strong ancient forces start a war for no reason?”

“If someone from the Jiang family killed the grandson of the Feng ancient clan’s Grand Elder, what would happen?” Ling Yan smiled.

Almost instinctively, the little azure dragon replied hurriedly. “Do I still need to say? Of course they would get to the bottom of it… But is that possible? That noble heir will die in Ye Qingtang’s hands, wouldn’t he? What has this got to do with the Jiang family?”

“But who would know that Miss Ye obtained the Heavenly Demon Pearl?” Ling Yan’s lips tugged up slightly. As a smile bloomed on his face, his expression appeared a little more detached.

“You…” The little azure dragon stared at Ling Yan in shock. “Not only did you add the power of the Karma Diversion on the Heavenly Demon Pearl, but there’s also the interfering aura from the Karma…”

“That’s right.” Ling Yan nodded slightly and said.

“That Grand Elder of the Feng clan left a streak of his spiritual power on his grandson. Once something happens to his grandson, the spiritual power would resurrect. If he sees that a lady with the Heavenly Demon bloodline killed his grandson, how do you think… the Grand Elder of the Feng clan would think?”

The little azure dragon narrowed its eyes and looked at Ling Yan.

“If that’s the case, the Grand Elder of the Feng clan would definitely think that the murderer of his grandson is from the Jiang family… because in the entire Central Mainland, only the Jiang family possesses the Heavenly Demon bloodline. Since you interacted with that Ye You previously, you used the power of karma to absorb the aura of her bloodline and transferred it to the Heavenly Demon Pearly with the power of your Karma Diversion. So… no matter what, the Grand Elder of the Feng clan will definitely believe that it was a member of the Jiang family who killed his grandson!”
