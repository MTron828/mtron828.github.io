Chapter 254: Mission Begins (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Sect disciples disappearing was a serious issue. The Elders had informed them of the path those disciples took before they set off. They only needed to follow that path to find out any suspicious places.

“Deer City? Where is that? I have never heard of that before.” Qin Huan read through the mission file.

There were three outer sect disciples who went missing when they were assigned to Deer City for their mission.

“Deer City is a small town. It was a carnage site a thousand years ago. There were wars and conflicts happening there all the time. Deer City was rebuilt and destroyed in wars again and again. It only settled down a few hundred years ago…” Ye Qingtang explained casually.

Qin Huan stared at her in surprise. How did this little girl know about all that?

Zhou Qu turned to look at Ye Qingtang frequently along the way. His sight was gloomy. He did not have any chance to confront her as Dai Changming asked everyone to rush along the way.

The team rode the horses for a few days, and a stretch of mountains appeared in front of them. The mountain was steep and blocked their way. Dai Changming and the rest came down from the horses. They frowned and stared at the mountains a few hundred meters tall.

“We have to cross the stretch of mountains in order to reach Deer City.” Dai Changming contemplated for a while.

“The mountain here is too steep for the horses. Get ready to climb up.”

Everyone’s faces were overcast with sadness after Dai Changming’s command. Horses could not climb up the mountains here. Even if they climbed by themselves, they might need to travel on foot for the road afterward.

Everyone could only quietly begin preparations. They tied the horses at the side, rolled up their sleeves, and prepared to climb.

The mountain was so steep that it was almost vertical. It was full of danger to climb by themselves. If they missed a step, they might just fall into the ridges.

When everyone was just about to climb, they suddenly heard the horses’ hooves from far. Two men in yellow were approaching the mountain on horses.

“Are they the disciples of the Wind Moon Sect?” Qin Huan was stunned as he saw the two men.

They both wore yellow clothes. The design made it obvious that they belonged to the Wind Moon Sect.

Disciples from all sects went missing, and all sects sent disciples out for investigation.

Ye Qingtang scanned them and captured the dragon pattern on their chest. She immediately knew their identities. The dragon pattern belonged to the Wind Moon Sect, and only inner sect disciples would have the patterns of their respective sects.

These two men were the Wind Moon Sect’s inner sect disciples!

Dai Changming and the rest also noticed that.

The investigation was carried out not only by the inner and outer sects but also by the respective Elders. It was normal to meet inner sect disciples from other sects.

The two disciples of the Wind Moon Sect reached the front of the mountain. One of the young men took a glance at Ye Qingtang and the group, but he appeared to not notice them at all as he looked straight at the youth beside. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The youth was still a child that was at most twelve or thirteen years old. His face was still pure and innocent.

“Junior Brother, you seldom leave the sect. Going on the mission this time will let you go through some training. We will only need at most half a day to reach Deer City after crossing this stretch of mountains,” The young man said and smiled.
