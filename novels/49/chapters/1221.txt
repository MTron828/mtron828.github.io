1222 Central Mainland 2

The stiff, vague voice sounded very eerie.

The man with the goatee turned pale. He had not expected his theft to be discovered. Now that the Undead Clan had its eye on him, he would probably die.

He tried to flee without saying another word, but the Undead rushed towards him, and they began to fight in mid-air.

When she saw that they were engaged in a fight, Ye Qingtang prepared to seize the opportunity to leave the area.

However…

At that moment, the man with the goatee was sent flying by the skeletons. He crashed forcefully into the huge rock where Ye Qingtang was hiding. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Boom!

The huge rock shattered.

Ye Qingtang and the little white tiger, who were hiding behind it, were immediately exposed to the Undead Clan…

“…” Ye Qingtang was speechless.

This was embarrassing.

The Undead had not expected anyone else to be there, and they were also taken aback.

The man with the goatee turned to look at Ye Qingtang. He raised his right hand and stuffed a bundle into Ye Qingtang’s hand. He said in a panic, “I can’t escape. Quick, take the Nine Souls Ring and leave. I’ll delay these Undead Clan people.”

With that, the man with the goatee prepared to fight the Undead Clan to the death.

Anyone who saw this scene would assume that Ye Qingtang was an accomplice of the man and had come to support him.

“F*ck, this guy is trying to get us into trouble!” The little white tiger glared and scolded him.

The man with the goatee clearly had no other choice and was trying to frame them. From what the Undead had said earlier, they knew that this man had stolen the Nine Souls Ring.

But now…

This bastard had given the Nine Souls Ring to Ye Qingtang in the presence of these Undead Clan people?!

He was probably going to try to seize the opportunity to flee.

Even if Ye Qingtang threw the bundle back to the man with the goatee, the Undead would assume that she was in cahoots with him.

“Just come for me! We’re definitely not returning the Nine Souls Ring to you,” the man with the goatee said to the stunned Undead with dignity. He looked poised to protect his companions so that they could flee.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang wanted to kill him.

She had met shameless people before but not someone as shameless as him!

However, since matters had already reached this stage, she had certainly become involved.

Ye Qingtang had no choice but to prepare for a fight.

However…

The Undead did not seem to have any intention of attacking. The hollow eyeholes in their skulls stared straight at Ye Qingtang until she broke out in goosebumps. Their bones clattered at each other from time to time, as if they were discussing something.

The man with the goatee thought that after he threw the object to the girl who had suddenly appeared, the Undead would rush forward and try to snatch the Nine Souls Ring from her. Then, he could seize the opportunity to sneak away.

But it turned out that…

For some reason, these Undead were not moving.

After a while, the atmosphere grew strange.

“Maybe these skeletons are brainless and can’t understand what’s going on? Shall we go?” The little white tiger suggested softly.

Ye Qingtang naturally did not wish to linger. While the Undead were in a state of shock, she turned with the intention of leaving.

But the moment Ye Qingtang turned, the Undead suddenly moved.

With a flying leap, they landed neatly in front of Ye Qingtang.
