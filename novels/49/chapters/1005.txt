Chapter 1006 Yang Lord (3)

Some of the remaining senior members of the Ye Family all stood in silence. They finally understood how ridiculous their behavior was previously. They were trying to condemn an unconquerable Yang Lord…

Everyone was shaking in fear after recalling what they had done.

The senior members of the Ye Family also realized why Ye Qingtang was so indifferent towards the Duan Family and the Long Family.

In the eyes of a Seventh Heaven Yin Yang Perfected Lord, the Duan Family and the Long Family were nothing. They should feel honored that Ye Qingtang even spoke to them…

However, Ye Qingtang did give them a chance. If the two families were not so greedy, Ye Qingtang would not choose to kill them all. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The senior members of the Ye Family were new to the family. Most of them only saw Ye Qingtang for the first time. They only heard that the family master’s daughter was a normal sect disciple. However, no one could imagine that this disciple was a real Seventh Heaven Yang Lord…

It was fortunate that Ye Qingtang was the Young Lady of Ye Family. Offending a Yang Lord might result in the death of all their related family members. How could they be alive till now?

“Young lady… Please… Please spare my life…”

The Third Elder was pale and trembled in fear. He kneeled down beside Ye Qingtang.

He did not have the courage to fight against the Long Family and only thought of surrendering all weapons and elixirs from Ye Qingtang to them to prevent a disaster.

“Get up,” Ye Qingtang said coldly.

Ye Qingtang was not familiar with the Third Elder, but he could see the big picture and solve the problem wisely. Furthermore, he did not do anything that would harm t Family. He even defended her in front of the Long Family. It was totally different from the senior members of the Ye Family that only thought of their own safety. Ye Family would need people like the Third Elder.

Though he was not able to do much, at least his heart belonged to the Ye Family.

The Third Elder sighed in relief after realizing that Ye Qingtang did not blame him.

“Thank… thank you Young Lady for the weapons and the elixirs… We will definitely protect the Ye Family in the future!”

Many senior members sighed as well.

They then looked towards Ye Qingtang and smiled as they held the yellow-grade weapons and elixirs from Ye Qingtang.

“Thank you Young Lady!”

“Thank you Young Lady!”

Some disciples of the Ye Family also showed their gratitude.

However, Ye Qingtang did not respond to them. She looked at the Third Elder and said, “Take back all weapons and elixirs I gave out previously.”

“What?!”

The disciples and the senior members were all shocked. Why would she take back all their weapons and elixirs when the problem was settled?

“Do you want to know the reason? Because none of you deserve them, and none of you are qualified to have them.” Ye Qingtang scanned through everyone.

The new senior members of the Ye Family only focused on their own benefits. They had no loyalty towards the Ye Family. The loyalty they showed now was just because the Young Lady of the Ye Family was a Yang Lord.
