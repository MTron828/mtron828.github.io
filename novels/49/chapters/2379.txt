Chapter 2380: To Compete Or Not To Compete (2)

Meanwhile, Ye Qingtang had led her brats back to their accommodation. They should have been basking in the glow of victory but the brats all had rather strange expressions. They did not appear the least bit happy but looked rather grave and troubled.

Ye Qingtang sat on the chair and surveyed the gloomy faces. She felt a slight headache coming.

“Why are you not satisfied after winning two spirit jades?”

The brats didn’t dare to speak. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Gong Jinyun was the only one who spoke up after some hesitation. “Teacher Ye, the Heaven Dome Academy’s ridicule is too insulting. We don’t need those spirit jades.”

Ye Qingtang understood those kids now.

“In that case, we should throw those two spirit jades back at the Heaven Dome Academy.”

The brats snapped out of their gloom.

“Boss, you’re right. You should just fling those spirit jades right in their faces. The Heaven Dome Academy thinks they are so good that they can look down on the Netherworld Academy. They talked as if we had no choice but to beg for their indulgence.” Nangong Lie was feeling very aggrieved.

“Very logical. I will fling them as hard as possible.” Ye Qingtang nodded as if she agreed.

The teenagers all hurriedly nodded in unison.

This was the Boss they knew.

But Ye Qingtang’s face suddenly darkened.

“You guys have eaten so well over the years and managed to grow big and strong, but failed to develop any brains.”

The brats were stunned by Ye Qing’s abrupt reprimand.

“Bo… Boss…” Lei Yan was befuddled.

Why did Boss suddenly scold them?

“Fling the spirit jades back at them? Just for the sake of venting your anger? You are all too spoiled.” Ye Qingtang was so exasperated that she didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

Why were the various academies fighting so hard?

It was all for those limited spirit jades, right?

Ye Qingtang had never entered the God Relic but she could tell how wondrous that place must be just by how highly regarded it was by the various academies.

If Ye Qingtang was still in her early teens, she might have really just destroyed the spirit jade in an impulsive fit of rage, right in front of Yin Kongluo.

But she was not.

The two spirit jades could let the Netherworld Academy send two more students into the God Relic. It could help the Netherworld Academy groom two more talented students.

If the Netherworld Academy was as powerful as the Heaven Dome Academy and Sky Martial Academy, Ye Qingtang might have done it just to vent her anger.

But the Netherworld Academy was not.

These spirit jades did not only belong to Ye Qingtang. They also belonged to the Netherworld Academy. Wu Fengling allowed Ye Qingtang to join the Netherworld Academy, how could she bear to let him down and betray his trust?

Ye Qingtang had already shed that immature way of thinking. She no longer let impulsive emotions control her actions.

“Do you think that after throwing away the spirit jade, we will be able to regain our dignity? Without true power, no one will ever hold you in any regard. To regain the Netherworld Academy’s reputation, you need to fight for it on the competition grounds.” Ye Qingtang spoke in a chilly voice.

The brats felt like they had been knocked in the head by Ye Qing.

“Boss…” Jing Ze spoke up in a timid voice.

Ye Qing just continued to stare at them coldly, and Jing Ze immediately shut up.

“Get out. If you want people to look up to you, you need to show real power,” Ye Qingtang said.

Having been thoroughly lectured, the brats wanted to say something but kept silent from fear and awe of Ye Qing’s fierce manner.

Boss usually treated them with kindness and behaved like a brother to them. He seldom gave them a black face, and so they were helpless at his sudden sternness and had no choice but to obediently leave.
