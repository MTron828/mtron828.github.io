Chapter 1677: A Tooth For A Tooth (3)

The force of her move almost crushed Mu Ruxue’s organs. Blood spurted from her mouth.

That warm blood sprayed Ye Qingtang’s face, but it could not reduce the chill in her eyes.

Bam! Ye Qingtang lifted her hand and punched Mu Ruxue in the face. The punch broke through any form of pitiful defense she could muster and smashed straight into her nose, pulverising it with a resounding crack. Tears and mucus spurted out, leaving behind no resemblance of her previously-gorgeous features.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes showed no pity as she watched Mu Ruxue writhing in pain.

Originally, she had not intended to bother with Mu Ruxue, because Mu Ruxue was not her goal in this Martial Arts Championship.

Mu Ruxue should not have been so cruel to Jiang Yiran.

The scene that was unfolding astonished everyone at the Martial Arts Championship. No one had expected Mu Ruxue, who was at the mid-stage of the Third Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate realm, to be utterly crushed by the young and unknown girl from the Jiang family to the point where she was unable to retaliate at all.

The Elder from the Mu family, who had been watching in interest, widened his eyes in disbelief as he saw Mu Ruxue being crushed like an ant. Even the Elder from the Baili family, who was standing nearby, could not help but frown.

At the other end of the seating area, the elders from the Jiang family were utterly floored.

What was going on?

Somehow... Ye Qingtang had completely suppressed Mu Ruxue?

But they all knew that Mu Ruxue was a powerful figure at the mid-stage of the Heavenly Venerate Third Heaven. Unless Ye Qingtang’s abilities had surpassed those of Mu Ruxue, why was she unharmed by the Swirling Stars?

“Elder Qian, what... Just what is going on? Ye Qingtang’s abilities...” Elder Kun, who had never noticed Ye Qingtang before, was shocked, to say the least.

Elder Qian gaped, but did not know what to say.

How would he know what was going on with Ye Qingtang’s abilities? When they had tested Ye Qingtang’s talents, they had clearly nothing like this!

The Jiang family elders were shocked speechless. Jiang Yisheng, who had been filled with concern, was standing next to the arena, watching Ye Qingtang land punch after punch on Mu Ruxue’s face. The force of her blows had caused that exquisite face to become bruised and swollen, and it now looked distorted and hideous.

“Qing... Qingtang... She... she...” Jiang Yisheng was so shocked that he was stammering.

“Shut up. Keep watching.” Jiang Shaobai’s eyes were fixed on Ye Qingtang. His expression was warm, and his eyes were filled with amusement.

In the arena, Mu Ruxue had fainted under Ye Qingtang’s heavy punches. Ye Qingtang had used the simplest and crudest methods, but her force was shocking. She had beaten Mu Ruxue until she was unable to retaliate and her head was buzzing.

The fervent punches had Mu Ruxue injured to the point that she flopped onto the ground. Blood bubbled out her mouth, a crimson stream that leaked from uncountable wounds all over her body. Her eyes which were already swollen, vaguely saw Ye Qingtang in front of her. Her eyes were filled with shock and anguish.

How could this be...

How could this be...

How could Ye Qingtang compare with her?

Impossible!

The person whom she assumed she could defeat so casually, was now abusing her without restraint. The arrogant Mu Ruxue was crushed by shame and despair.

“Mu Ruxue, do you think you’re very beautiful?” Ye Qingtang slowly walked over to Mu Ruxue. She looked down at Mu Ruxue, who was lying there like a sack of dirty mud.

“You...”

Ye Qingtang suddenly reached out and dragged Mu Ruxue up. With a flick of her wrist, she unsheathed the sword that was girdled around her waist. As she held the sword blade in front of Mu Ruxue, the latter could clearly see her features gleaming across the blade.
