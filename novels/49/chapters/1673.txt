Chapter 1674: Bearing The Consequences (3)

“Elder Qian, this is all my fault. That Mu Ruxue...” Jiang Yiran hurriedly spoke up and wanted to tell Elder Qian about how he had gotten into trouble and involved Ye Qingtang. He wanted Elder Qian to persuade Ye Qingtang to admit defeat.

But before he could finish speaking, Ye Qingtang punched him in the stomach. He could not speak and gasped from the pain.

What was this little girl doing?!

“Hmm?” Elder Qian did not know what Jiang Yiran intended to say.

“Elder Qian, thank you for your concern. I will do my best.” Ye Qingtang’s expression was serene when she replied to Elder Qian.

Elder Qian nodded contentedly and left.

“Little girl, you’re so vicious...” Jiang Yiran held his throbbing stomach.

“I’m entering the arena. You don’t need to bother about anything else,” said Ye Qingtang.

Jiang Yiran opened his mouth, but no words came out.

...

While the next few matches were taking place, Jiang Yiran vanished into thin air. By the time Ye Qingtang noticed and vaguely sensed that something was amiss, her match with Mu Ruxue was about to begin.

“Qingtang! I’m afraid that Jiang Yiran...” Jiang Yisheng suddenly raced over to Ye Qingtang, panic written over his face. The front of his robes was covered with blood.

“Ye Qingtang. Mu Ruxue, enter the arena.”

At that moment, Ye Qingtang’s name was called to enter the arena.

Jiang Yisheng still wanted to say something, but someone came to lead Ye Qingtang to the stage. When Jiang Yisheng saw that, he broke out in cold sweat.

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly and her gaze swept past Jiang Yisheng. Jiang Yisheng must have something important to say to her regarding Jiang Yiran.

What had happened to Jiang Yiran?

Meanwhile, the Jiang family elders were watching from the raised platform as Ye Qingtang prepared to fight Mu Ruxue. As they knew how the match would end, they were not overly concerned. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

After all, Ye Qingtang and Mu Ruxue were miles apart. She had no hope of winning.

It was not just the Jiang family elders. Even the Mu family was not paying any attention to this match. They had never heard of this Ye Qingtang before, and had not seen any outstanding performance from her during this Martial Arts Championship. It was unsurprising that they felt this victory was assured, so it did not matter whether they watched this match or not.

“Ruxue has done very well this year. She must be in the middle of the Third Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate realm?” A Baili family elder smiled at a Mu family elder.

“She already broke through to the middle stage of the Third Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate realm before we came,” The Mu family elder said with a smile.

“Your Mu family has another young genius besides Mu Feiruo. Congratulations are in order.” The Baili family elder said. Mu Ruxue’s abilities were pretty good. It was unlikely that she would make it into the top ten, but she was already doing very well.

“Your Baili family already has two members who entered the finals of the previous championship. Baili Xi’s abilities are terrifying, and I heard that Baili Xuanyun’s abilities have also improved vastly this year.”

The elders from the two families did not pay attention to this match, which had a foregone conclusion. Instead, they started flattering each other.

As Ye Qingtang pondered the matter, she reached the arena. Mu Ruxue also appeared before her eyes.

At that moment, Mu Ruxue was all smiles. She looked at Ye Qingtang like she would a lamb led to the slaughter.

“Ye Qingtang, I didn’t think you would dare to enter the arena,” Mu Ruxue said smilingly as she looked at Ye Qingtang.

There was no response from Ye Qingtang. But from the corner of her eye, she glimpsed a spot of fresh blood on Mu Ruxue’s sleeve.
