Chapter 2411: Faulty Talisman (2)

With that, Ye Qingtang took off her coat and bit her finger. With blood from her finger, she wrote some words on her coat, then displayed her words at the balls.

‘Lu Yuanxiang’s teleportation talisman is not working. Entire team is seriously injured. Urgent medical attention needed.’

The balls transmitted those blood-red words to Wen Qi’s eyes.

Wen Qi thought Lu Yuanxiang’s team would be out of danger once they activated the teleportation talisman. When he saw the talisman crushed but Lu Yuanxiang’s team remained standing there, he was very shocked. Following that, he saw Ye Qing’s message and the dread rose in the pit of his stomach.

Wen Qi’s face grew extremely grim.

“What is going on? How did the teleportation talisman fail?” Wen Qi stood up, his face filled with shock.

The teleportation talisman was the only way to safely transport people out. The consequences of a talisman not working was unimaginable.

The other academy folks were similarly stunned. Lu Yuanxiang’s team was the first to activate the teleportation talisman. No one had discovered this anomaly yet.

“The teleportation talisman failed to work? How is that possible? Wen Qi, what exactly happened to your team?” The other academy leaders gathered around him. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Wen Qi told everyone what happened to Lu Yuanxiang’s team. Everyone’s faces instantly darkened.

“Faulty talismans and a monster above Emperor level inside the Wailing Well. If this goes on… it’s a catastrophe waiting to happen.” One of the Heaven Dome Academy teachers stated gravely.

They could not confirm now if Lu Yuanxiang’s teleportation talisman was the only faulty one, or if all the talismans did not work.

If it was the former, things were not as bad. If it was the latter…

They did not even want to imagine the consequences!

“Go and find the Universe City organizers! Have them explain what the hell is happening!” One of the Vice-Presidents commanded in a low voice.

The academies all sent their own men to find people from Universe City. But before they had even left the hall, they bumped into Luo Sheng, who had left earlier.

“There’s no need for you to go.” Luo Sheng was frowning deeply as he looked at the academy folks. His voice was very tense.

“What do you mean?”

Luo Sheng took a deep breath before turning toward the worried-looking Wen Qi.

“The Universe City people… have all disappeared.”

“What!”

Exclamations echoed throughout the hall.

“What do you mean by all disappeared?”

Luo Sheng replied, “I have searched every corner of Universe City. Those people in charge of the Inter-Academy Competition have all disappeared.”

The Inter-Academy Competition was a competition between the various academies that were fighting for the chance to enter the God Relic. The academies all had a personal interest in the competition, so to ensure a fair fight, the Universe City folks were put in charge of the Inter-Academy Competition. They were the first people to discover the God Relic and were very powerful and well-respected. There had not been any accidents in any of the previous years’ competitions.

But unexpectedly…

They had suddenly disappeared.

Luo Sheng’s news was like a bolt of lightning, striking everyone on the head. The other academies did not believe Luo Sheng’s words that easily. They still rushed out to confirm if he was speaking the truth.

The academy leaders remained in the hall, gazing at Ye Qing’s bloody message. Their faces were extremely grim.
