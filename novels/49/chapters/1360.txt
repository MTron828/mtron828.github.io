Chapter 1361 You Are Deliberately Provoking Me 3

“Su… Su Qiao… You… You dared to kill my father…” Dongfang Kai shook as he stared at Ye Qingtang.

Even if one beat him to death, he would never have believed that Ye Qingtang could kill his father so easily.

One should know that…

In Dongfang Kai’s heart, his father was one of the best in the entire kingdom in terms of skill. In the capital, no one could defeat his father besides General Qiao and a few of His Majesty’s guards.

“He was too weak,” Ye Qingtang said casually, but truthfully.

She had not intended to kill anyone.

However…

These people’s abilities were so poor that she could not bear looking at them. How was she to know that she could kill someone just by raising her hand?

Ye Qingtang had recently attained the Arcane Supremacy First Heaven. In the vast expanse of the Central Mainland, her abilities were simply the foundation of any other cultivator’s abilities.

But in this world where there was no such thing as cultivation, it was an entirely different story.

It was like…

A person in armor standing in an ants’ nest. He could cause widespread destruction by just moving his hands.

Although Ye Qingtang was speaking the truth, the words sounded incredibly shameful and mocking to Dongfang Kai!

Although Dongfang Kai’s heart was filled with hatred, he was not stupid. He did not dare to contest Ye Qingtang. He could only slink away.

Ye Qingtang did not intend to stop him. She was still familiarizing herself with everything in this world, including martial skills that were so weak they were almost negligible. Also… she wanted to complete the mission that the God of Nature had given her as soon as possible and obtain nebula points.

Although the people here were indescribably weak, the area was rich in spirit energy. Ye Qingtang only needed to complete her mission, and then she could cultivate here while also obtaining nebula points to exchange for a treasure in the Star Pavilion.

One must know that of the two items she had seen, her abilities would be greatly enhanced by either one. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The General’s wife was in shock. She embraced Dongfang Qing’s body and wept. Su Lin’er was terrified. She looked dazed when she saw the ground full of blood.

General Qiao’s expression was very complicated. When he looked at Ye Qingtang, he looked both surprised and delighted.

He had thought that his daughter was completely ruined, but who knew… she actually possessed such terrifying power. How could a martial arts enthusiast like him not be excited?

“Qiao’er, you go back. I will take care of everything here.” General Qiao stepped forward. His expression was strange, but he continued to maintain his protective attitude towards Ye Qingtang.

“His Majesty greatly values Dongfang Qing. Now that you have killed him, the Dongfang family won’t let you off so easily.”

Although General Qiao was delighted in the sudden growth of his daughter’s abilities, he was also worried about Dongfang Qing’s death.

In recent years, the Emperor had become more and more persistent in his quest to achieve immortality. Dongfang Qing specialized in refining elixirs, and the Emperor had appointed him to refine elixirs for immortality. Now, Dongfang Qing was dead just like that. This matter would not be resolved so easily.

Ye Qingtang had not intended to kill anyone. She had only wanted to seize the opportunity to complete her mission. But she did not panic. Instead, she used the time to return to her room to try cultivating in this world.

The abundant spirit energy greatly sped up her cultivation. Ye Qingtang had previously obtained Black Heaven Water from the Hell of Avicinaraka but had not found a suitable opportunity to use it. Now, she took it out.

Spirit roots were not of much use to someone in the Arcane Supremacy realm. Ye Qingtang gulped down the water and clearly felt the spirit root in her body grow warm. As the warmth spread, the speed at which she could absorb spirit energy also doubled.
