Chapter 667: Leaving the Mystic Realm (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye You flicked her wrist slightly and gently wiped the blood off the corners of her lips. As she looked at the Ice Frost Divine Sword ahead, her brows were furrowed deeply.

She had not entered this part of the mystic realm for long and thus did not know what happened.

After seeing that Ye You was injured by the Ice Frost Divine Sword, everyone from Yunxiao Sect was shocked, and several disciples rushed forward hurriedly.

“What happened here…” Ye You asked softly.

“Senior Sister Ye You, it’s Ning Luo!” One of the Yunxiao Sect disciples told Ye You about the sequence of events.

“Ning Luo…”

After learning the situation, Ye You was shocked. Ning Luo was not a human but a sword spirit of a divine sword?

“Ye You, just nice that you’re here. I almost forgot about you.”

Ning Luo’s voice appeared from the Ice Frost Divine Sword.

In the next second, Ning Luo condensed into a human form. His long black hair swayed in the wind. Wielding the Ice Frost Divine Sword in his hands, his aloof eyes landed on Ye You.

“This is bad…”

Everyone from Yunxiao Sect felt their blood run cold when they saw the shocking murderous aura around Ning Luo.

Many Yunxiao Sect disciples were already seniors in the inner sect, and they knew that there were some grudges between Ning Luo and Ye You. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Back when Ning Luo was in the sect, he had a rather close relationship with a junior sister. However, that junior sister had a conflict with Ye You and offended her. Thus, all her cultivation was destroyed, and she was kicked out of the sect.

On her departure from the sect, she encountered a group of rogues and had a tragic ending…

However, everyone in Yunxiao Sect was shocked right now. Ning Luo was a sword spirit which hid in Yunxiao Sect. Could it be that he really had some feelings with that junior sister in the sect…

When Ye Qingtang saw that Ning Luo returned again, seeming to have some grudges with Ye You, she naturally sat out and waited to reap the spoils later on.

At that moment, Ning Luo’s manner was increasingly shocking. A frightening layer of frost emerged on his body as he faced Ye You, seeming as though he was really infuriated.

“Ye You, we can settle our scores now.” Ning Luo had an aloof expression. His tone was utterly cold like a million-year-old glacier.

“Since you are a sword spirit, what grudges do we have?” Ye You rose slowly and looked at Ning Luo.

“Who told you that sword spirits do not have feelings?” As Ning Luo spoke, the Ice Frost Divine Sword in his hands slashed towards Ye You.

Almost instantly, the surrounding area was frozen by the aura slashed out by the Ice Frost Divine Sword.

Ye You was agile and had flown away the instant Ning Luo waved the sword.

It was, however, that the few disciples in front of Ye You turned into frost and vanished into dust.

Back when Ning Luo was hiding in Yunxiao Sect, he was not close to anyone other than that kind junior sister who was Ning Luo’s only friend in Yunxiao Sect.

However, this only friend was indirectly killed by Ye You.

After the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm started, Ning Luo originally thought that Ye You had already died in that land of inheritance. Yet, unexpectedly, she gained the inheritance and was not injured at all.

“Ning Luo, I’ll remember our grudge for now. Since you’re a sword spirit, you will eventually submit to me one day.” Ye You stood in the air proudly and stared down at Ning Luo.

After hearing that, Ning Luo’s lips curled up slightly. “I’m afraid that you don’t have a future.”

“That’s not necessarily so.” As Ye You spoke, she took out a black talisman which burned on its own in the next second.

“Spatial Teleport Talisman…” Ning Luo was in thought when he saw that talisman.
