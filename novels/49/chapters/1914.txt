Chapter 1915: Tricks (3)

There was only one thing that could make them all take action at the same time.

The mysterious youth.

Ye Qingtang had asked Ming Wang to investigate the origins of the youth but to no avail. Perhaps the other clans would have more information.

In the grand hall of the Temple of Shadows.

The Ancient Mu Clan Leader’s expression was mild as his gaze swept across the Baili family clan, the Dongyue family clan, and a few other ancient clans.

These people were all leaders of the various ancient clans in the Central Mainland. The presence of any one of these leaders was enough to make the earth and mountains quake.

Yet they had all appeared here together with complicated expressions. In the past, they would never have all appeared in the Temple of Shadows at the same time.

For the past ten thousand years, the disappearance of the Holy Lord of Shadows had caused the Temple of Shadows to grow weak. They had all but forgotten about the Undead Clan.

At the same time, they weren’t concerned when they heard about the return of the Holy Lord of Shadows since it had nothing to do with them.

However...

The peace had been shattered in half a month.

This effeminate boy who had appeared out of nowhere had massacred so many strong ancient clans in such a short amount of time, among which included the Domain Monarch Jiang.

The clans that had been attacked had suffered great losses, with many dead and too many injured. Some clans had been completely wiped out. Even the bigger ancient clans which were often at odds with each other had seen the situation for what it was.

Someone who destroyed entire clans was not a person they wanted to acknowledge, but it had gotten to a point where they had no other choice.

“Clan Elder Dongyue, have you checked on the situation of the Nanlin Clan?” the Mu Clan Elder asked quietly.

It was rumored that the Nanlin Clan had been completely wiped out, with all of its members dead.

The Dongyue Clan and Nanlin Clan were rather close to each other and interacted regularly, which meant that they probably knew more about the situation.

“The rumors are true. I visited the Nanlin Clan after everything happened. The truth is... far worse than the rumors.” Clan Elder Dongyue sighed.

The faces of the members from the other clans darkened. As the strength of the different clans were all head to head, the slaughter of the Nanlin Clan naturally alarmed the other clans.

Ye Qingtang walked in as the clan elders discussed quietly.

The entire grand hall fell silent as the clan leaders’ gazes all landed on the beautiful figure on the Black Bone Throne.

“Greetings, Holy Lord of Shadows,” the Baili Family Clan Elder said politely when he saw Ye Qingtang.

The other clan elders were polite as well. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Ye Qingtang looked at the scene before her, which consisted of some of the most influential clan elders. Her heart was pounding but her face remained calm.

“To what do I owe the pleasure of having all the Clan Elders in the Temple of Shadows today?”

“I’m not sure if the Holy Lord has heard but an extremely formidable person has appeared in the mainland and he has massacred many clans,” a clan elder said.

“I have heard about it,” Ye Qingtang said lightly.

So she had guessed correctly.

They were here because of that.

“We have heard that... this person tried to challenge the Holy Lord of Shadows but was chased away.”
