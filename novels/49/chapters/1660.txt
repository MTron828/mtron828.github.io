Chapter 1661: Beauty Roll (2)

“Wipe that disgusting look off your face before someone sees it and you embarrass the Jiang family.” Jiang Yiran and a few of the other Jiang family youths walked over. They looked disdainful when they saw Jiang Yisheng’s besotted expression.

“What’s it to you?! Why do you keep stalking me!” Jiang Yisheng was infuriated.

“Oh, whatever do you mean? It should be me that’s asking why you keep appearing before my eyes. You’re hurting them.” Jiang Yiran did not give an inch.

Jiang Yisheng glared at him. He could not be bothered to quibble with the latter. It was a rare chance to be near Mu Feiruo, so he would not waste any time on this scum.

“Is Mu Feiruo that beautiful?” Jiang Yiran glanced at Mu Feiruo. Although he thought she was not bad looking, she was not stunning.

“Of course! Mu Feiruo was the most beautiful girl in the last Martial Arts Championship,” Jiang Yisheng said frankly.

Jiang Yiran smiled before he cast a sly glance at Ye Qingtang, who was sitting nearby. “I think her younger sister, Mu Ruxue is much better looking. But... don’t you think that this little girl is even prettier than Mu Feiruo and Mu Ruxue?”

“Ye Qingtang, “...”

Please let me off!

If she had known that Jiang Yiran would hold a grudge for so long, she would not have fought him earlier.

He was such a pest.

Jiang Yisheng was about to protest, but when he saw that Ye Qingtang did not look provoked, he calmed down.

Objectively speaking, Ye Qingtang was definitely a rare beauty. No matter how hard Jiang Yisheng tried, he could not find a single flaw in Ye Qingtang’s features.

“Shaobai, what do you think?” Jiang Yiran said with a laugh. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Jiang Shaobai’s head was on the table and he lazily raised his eyes.

“Unusual.”

“Eh?” Jiang Yiran did not understand.

Jiang Shaobai said, “You’ve finally said something sensible.”

“...” Jiang Yiran felt his chest ache.

Why was this fellow’s tongue so wicked?

“Elder Sister Qing is the most beautiful.” Jiang Shaobai looked smilingly at Ye Qingtang, his sharp tongue practically dripping with honey.

“...” Please completely ignore Ye Qingtang. Thank you.

Jiang Yiran rubbed his chest and replied, “I heard that during every Martial Arts Championship, besides a ranking of abilities, there is also a beauty ranking. They identify the most beautiful girl in the Martial Arts Championship. Mu Feiruo came in first in the last championship. I think this time, the little girl has a chance.”

By now, Ye Qingtang really wanted to kick Jiang Yiran.

Jiang Yiran and the others were still making mocking comments when Mu Ruxue, who was sitting nearby, suddenly looked in their direction.

“What’s the matter?” Baili Xuanyun was sitting with Mu Ruxue and Mu Feiruo, and he could not help but ask when he saw the direction of Mu Ruxue’s glance.

Baili Xuanyun ranked as the tenth most powerful figure in the last Martial Arts Championship. It was because of this that he was friendly with Mu Feiruo. It was no surprise that Baili Xuanyun liked Mu Feiruo looks and the Mu Family’s power, so he intended to develop a closer relationship with her. But Mu Feiruo was cold by nature, and it had not been easy.

At that point, Mu Ruxue had turned up.

Mu Ruxue was Mu Feiruo’s younger sister and the apple of the Mu Family Master’s eye. Although she was not as talented as Mu Feiruo, she was slightly younger and much more lively. So Baili Xuanyun had decided to target Mu Ruxue instead.

Baili Xuanyun was proud of his own talents and his position in the Baili Family was fairly high. But he was always being repressed by Baili Xi. This made him discontented, so he intended to find another way out.
