Chapter 1951: Old Acquaintance (1)

Those youths immediately sprang forth the moment Ming Di uttered those words. In the blink of an eye, flashing beams of light and loud booms resonated through the air.

The eyes of the Domain Monarch widened as he watched Ming Di take on several Ancient You Clan youths at the same time.

He had heard rumors of how powerful the Temple of Shadows’ Ming Di was. But the dragon had vanished without a trace for so many years. He never expected that...

Even under the united attack by those youths, Ming Di still had the clear upper hand. With just a swish of his massive dragon’s tail, none of the youths could withstand the impact. Some managed to survive, but only barely with serious injuries. Others were instantly killed on impact, following in the footsteps of that earlier youth.

The Ancient You Clan warden had been full of confidence but was now frowning as he witnessed Ming Di’s slaughter. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Although these youths were not the most powerful of their batch, they still possessed enough power to destroy an entire ancient clan on their own. He had thought with them attacking in a group, it should be no problem for the youths to handle that demon dragon.

But...

The Temple of Shadows’ Ming Di was really that powerful. He instinctively glanced at Ye Qingtang, who had remained by the sidelines the entire time.

He narrowed his eyes.

“You guys, go to the Holy Spirit Hall now.” The warden commanded the sentries as he witnessed the humiliating defeat of those youths.

He refused to believe that this Ming Di was totally undefeatable.

The sight of Ming Di’s great killing spree was a boon to those ancient clan members. They cheered happily as Ming Di helped them dish out some form of revenge.

Ye Qingtang was the only one who remained impassive under her mask. She only continued to observe those youths carefully.

It appeared that Ming Di was winning easily, but Ye Qingtang also realized that not all of the youths were the same.

Most of the youths were on the same level as their dead predecessors. But a couple of them were able to stand up again after being swiped by Ming Di’s tail.

The abilities of those two youths were far above the rest.

But just seconds later, Ming Di managed to defeat the remaining youths, who collapsed dead to the ground.

Just as the ancient clan folks wanted to cheer and take this opportunity to save their own people, several figures dashed out from the canyon. Before the ancient clan people could see who they were, loud booms echoed through the air.

Three identical-looking youths had appeared in front of Ming Di.

“Mmm? More have come to seek their deaths?” Ming Di tilted his head and stared at those three youths.

The youths didn’t waste time talking to Ming Di. They just lunged forward.

Ming Di swung his tail again but those three youths managed to dodge it. They leaped away, completely unharmed.

“These three guys seem to be even stronger than those before them?” The eyes of the Nanlin Clan Leader widened in disbelief.

The earlier Ancient You Clan youths were already powerful beyond comprehension. No one imagined that the clan had even more powerful fighters.

The hearts of everyone thumped heavily with apprehension.

Previously, Ming Di had been able to deal crushing defeats to the Ancient You Clan. But these new youths were much faster and more powerful than those before them. Faced with three of them on his own, it was not certain if Ming Di could still defeat them.
