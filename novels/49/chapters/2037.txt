Chapter 2038: Return (2)

Ling Yan didn’t enter Ye Qingtang’s room and was instead forced back into his room.

The little azure dragon looked calmly at him being thrown back into his room.

“You’ll be beaten to death one day,” it said coldly.

Ling Yan looked at it without saying a word.

The little azure dragon continued, “Ye Qingtang is never going to want to see your face again if she finds out what you have planned.”

“I’ll change my face then,” he said with a smile.

The little azure dragon could feel a headache coming on.

“Ling Yan, I really can’t read you at all. I come from the azure dragon clan and can be considered rather intelligent, which is why I’ve been able to predict your plans up to three steps ahead. But beyond that, I really have no idea what you’re planning.”

Ling Yan took off his coat and leaned lazily on his chair. He rested his face on one hand and gazed at the perplexed little azure dragon.

“You’ll understand when it happens.”

...

Ye Qingtang went to find Mi and brought him to the Hall of Gloom to show him the vessel. All that was left was to take the rest of the fragments from the Ancient You Clan.

She gave him a suggestion.

“The Ancient You Clan has been sending the youths to gather the fragments. I managed to obtain a few from the space rings after defeating them previously. Since this is the case, why not just defeat all their forces so we can gather the fragments more quickly?” Ye Qingtang said, pretending to be serious. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

But she had her own motives for doing this.

She had to determine Little You Yun’s location and find You Qiong. Her conversation with him had been cut off the last time they talked and she felt extremely uneasy about it. But he had not told her his location so she had no way of rescuing him quickly even if she wanted to.

It would be faster to destroy the Ancient You Clan’s forces to look for him rather than look around aimlessly!

Since the Crimson League’s goal was to obtain all the fragments, they naturally had no issue with her suggestion.

The Crimson League and Temple of Shadows quickly joined forces to attack the Ancient You Clan.

The Ancient You Clan had been on the rise previously and had been arrogantly flaunting their might, which had led to the location of their forces being revealed.

Riding on Ming Di, Ye Qingtang swept away the Ancient You Clan’s forces along with the Crimson League. Like this, the situation on the Central Mainland was quickly reversed.

Those who had chosen to follow the Ancient You Clan because of their might were all suffering now.

They had been the loyal dogs of the Ancient You Clan and had wreaked much havoc for them. But now the Ancient You Clan couldn’t even protect themselves, let alone them...

But as they got rid of the Ancient You Clan’s forces, Ye Qingtang realized that they had been hiding their forces. Even after defeating many of their strongholds, they had yet to come across important people. They had not encountered many of the youths as well.

The Ancient Clans all cheered as they saw the Ancient You Clan’s forces fall one by one. They were extremely grateful to Ye Qingtang and the Temple of Shadows.

But Ye Qingtang couldn’t be happy at all. She still had no idea where You Qiong was and Ning Luo hadn’t been able to sense You Yun at the locations they had been as well.

Even though she was the one who had started this, it was beginning to feel like a losing battle.

But this was all interrupted by You Qiong’s new information.

“Holy Lord....”

A voice suddenly rang out of the voice transmission stone which had been silent for half a month.
