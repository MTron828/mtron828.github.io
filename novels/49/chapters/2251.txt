Chapter 2252: Legacy Place (2)

In a place like this, the less time spent here the better.

Eyes scanning the crowd, Ye Qingtang finally confirmed that Mu Ziying had been safely brought over by the Rising Dragon Island men. The sight relaxed her a little.

Just as Ye Qingtang was about to seize this opportunity to herd these people over to her desired location, she suddenly spied several familiar figures from the corner of her eye.

Lei Yan and the rest were just teenagers and their experience through the Matrix Path had exhausted them. If they hadn’t eaten the mute elixirs, they would have already all been dead meat.

Just the sight of those hallucinations was enough to make them scream their lungs out.

The ragtag bunch was right at the end of the group. They had witnessed every single gory mishap that had happened to those before them.

Luckily the tomb was rather dim. Otherwise, their legs would have gone all soft if they had been able to clearly see the bloody massacre of those people by the evil demons. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Ye Qingtang: “…”

When did those brats follow them in?

Ye Qingtang had planned to lure these people to her destination, before making an excuse to rescue Mu Ziying and then fleeing. She never expected Lei Yan and those brats to have followed them in.

It looked like they must have followed the group after Mu Ziying was captured…

Ye Qingtang suddenly felt very tired.

It was already very difficult to escape with one Mu Ziying. Now, those few brats have all come to join the party. Her temples throbbed painfully. She desperately wished to just fling those damn brats far away.

They were gutsy.

Those few brats dared to dream of snatching Mu Ziying back from the Rising Dragon Island men?

Ye Qingtang took a deep breath to suppress the violent impulse to beat them up. Thereafter, her mind raced as she thought of how she would have to make adjustments to her earlier plan.

At this thought, Ye Qingtang led the group forward. The fiendcelestial’s tomb was very big, far more expansive than any of them expected.

In her previous life, Ye Qingtang once heard someone, who had personally visited the tomb, say that the tomb actually took up the entire underground space beneath the whole Evil Soul Forest. It would take at least a month to walk one full round…

And dangers were lurking everywhere. Even if one knew of the traps within, there was still a very high possibility of death.

Ye Qingtang was not confident in continuing inward. But luckily, the place where she planned to lead the group was near the entrance.

The crowd muddled through the darkness for a long time, before feeling like they had entered a strange underground palace. The huge palace hall had 12 massive doors. A different beast was carved above each door.

The crowd had just stepped in when blue flames lit up on the walls of the underground palace.

The blue flames brightened up this strange-looking underground palace.

“Where is this place?” The crowd asked after seeing Ye Qingtang stop right in the center of the palace.

“The Legacy Place.” Ye Qingtang replied.

“Legacy Place?” The crowd was taken aback.

Was the black-robed person telling the truth? Did the fiendcelestial really need to find a person to inherit his will?

The various factions were all tempted by the desire to try. By this point, inheriting the fiendcelestial’s will had become even more important than any hidden treasure.

Ye Qingtang was in no hurry to speak and the various factions continued to daydream. Elder Feng and the rest examined the inside of this underground palace. When they approached those 12 doors, they could clearly feel intense demonic energies radiating from the gaps between the doors and walls.

Elder Feng’s face shifted slightly, and he asked the demon child in a low voice.

“What do you think?”
