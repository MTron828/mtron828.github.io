Chapter 260: Blood Moon Sect Elder (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The Blood Moon Sect Elder landed his eyes on the disciple freakishly. His red, bleeding eyes were like that of a demon, inducing fear in people.

“So you choose death…”

Ye Qingtang saw that there was something wrong with the situation and hurriedly pulled the senior brother back. With a slightly pale complexion, she said in a low voice, “Senior Brother, don’t act rashly.”

The disciple felt his blood turn cold after being looked at by the Blood Moon Sect elder. The righteousness in him was slowly swallowed away by the immense despair and fear. He clenched his teeth in secret but never spoke again.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder slowly moved his eyes away, and his almost-illusory voice sounded again.

“There is a fine line between your life and death. You will live should you submit, or die should you resist.”

His harrowing tone exuded an immense pressure, shrouding everyone’s mind.

Cold sweat trickled down their foreheads.

As everyone was struggling and hesitating, Ye Qingtang suddenly frowned. She glanced across the senior brothers around her but saw that everyone’s faces were a pale white and were extremely terrified. She looked at the Blood Moon Sect Elder who was standing high above the masses without alerting anyone, and a strange feeling emerged in her heart.

“Junior Sister Ye?” Qin Huan quickly asked in a soft voice upon sensing Ye Qingtang’s reaction.

Ye Qingtang frowned and said, “Senior Brother Qin, if the Blood Moon Sect was really that powerful, why would it give us a chance to make a choice?”

Ye Qingtang had a feeling that there was something wrong with the behavior of this Blood Moon Sect Elder.

In the eyes of the Blood Moon Sect Elder, their existence was simply like that of an ant.

Why would there be a room for choice?

Even when Ye Qingtang met the evil spirit at Spirit Condensation Mountain Village, she could not even catch a breath as the evil spirit was not even willing to say anything to them and just exterminated everyone.

However…

The Blood Moon Sect Elder before them repeatedly gave them a chance to make a choice.

Ye Qingtang really found this strange.

Qin Huan went blank a little after listening. “Are you saying that… this Blood Moon Sect Elder may not be as powerful as what we think?”

Ye Qingtang nodded slightly.

Although she had some guesses in her mind, she did not dare to take any actions rashly. If there was any mistake in her reasoning, death was their only fate, and there would be no chance to prove her guesses.

However, this whisper fell into the ears of another disciple from aside. Turning to look back at the Blood Moon Sect Elder, he realized that while it felt exceptionally powerful, it did not plan on attacking them. His heart skipped a beat.

If this Blood Moon Sect Elder was merely putting on a false show of strength…

That was a Blood Moon Sect Elder!

If he could kill it, it would be a great contribution to the sect.

Even entering the inner sect as an exception would not be an issue!

Then, the disciple made up his mind. Quietly taking a deep breath, he walked out from the group of disciples.

Ye Qingtang and the rest were taken aback as they did not expect the disciple to actually walk towards the Blood Moon Sect Elder. Seeing that, their expressions changed.

Instinctively, Qin Huan wanted to stop that disciple but was pulled back by Ye Qingtang, who quietly shook her head. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

However, the disciple walked straight to stand before the Blood Moon Sect Elder with a humble attitude and suddenly knelt down in front of everyone.

“I am willing to submit to the Blood Moon Sect!”

The Blood Moon Sect Elder narrowed his eyes.

Dai Changming and the rest turned pale.

However, just as everyone thought that the disciple chose to submit in fear of the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s authority, the disciple suddenly drew out a sword when the Blood Moon Sect Elder narrowed its eyes. As the sword glimmered, he immediately stabbed towards the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s chest using his fastest speed with an urgent yearning in his eyes!
