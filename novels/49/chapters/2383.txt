Chapter 2384: Making A Choice (3)

“Since we know we are going to lose, why don’t we conserve our energy?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Conserve energy? Teacher Ye has never participated in an Inter-Academy Competition before. Do you know that if the Netherworld Academy actively forfeits the preceding segments, the amount of criticism we would have to endure?”

“So you are saying that the Netherworld Academy is not being criticized now?” Ye Qingtang asked in a mild tone.

The teachers all stiffened.

From the moment the Netherworld Academy started to decline, the criticisms never ceased.

“I will consider this matter carefully. Everyone, please return first and think through it too. If anyone has any ideas, please let me know.” Wen Qi spoke up. After imparting some other instructions, he allowed them to leave.

“Ye Qing, wait a moment.” Wen Qi suddenly asked for Ye Qing to stay. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The other teachers all looked surprised.

Ye Qing had created quite a stir in the Netherworld Academy earlier and they all acknowledged his powers. But he was still too young. The other teachers did not believe that Ye Qing was good enough to assume this responsibility.

After everyone else departed, only Wen Qi and Ye Qing were left in the room.

“Vice-President, do you have more instructions for me?” Ye Qingtang asked.

Wen Qi kept silent for a moment as he gazed at Ye Qing. He then spoke slowly. “If you lead the team inside the Wailing Well for the team competition, what are your chances of winning?”

Ye Qingtang replied frankly, “30%.”

30% was not that great of a number. But this was the highest percentage that Ye Qingtang could offer. After all, no one had ever really entered the Wailing Well before.

But Wen Qi gave a sudden laugh.

“30%? That’s enough.”

With that, Wen Qi looked at Ye Qing. “In reality, President Wu and I have already predicted the outcome of this Inter-Academy Competition, and we do not have any high hopes for this year’s competition. We just want to make use of this one last chance to let our students gain more experience.”

Their chances of winning in the martial arts segment were as good as zero.

But Ye Qing was able to offer a 30% chance at winning the team competition.

Wen Qi could see that although Ye Qing was young, he was very level-headed and capable when it came to handling things. His calm, competent manner was unlike that of a youth only in his 20s.

“Since you already have a plan, we will go along with your arrangements. I will settle everything else.” Wen Qi gave his permission.

Ye Qingtang was taken aback.

Was Wen Qi agreeing just like that?

“You don’t need to bother about the plans of the other teachers, the Netherworld Academy can spare a team to fight for a chance. But we cannot have everyone else give up on the martial arts segment…” Wen Qi looked at Ye Qing with a grave expression.

“For some competitions, even though we know we will lose, we have no choice but to meet them.”

Ye Qingtang understood Wen Qi’s meaning.

“There’s something else.” Wen Qi suddenly piped up.

“Vice-President, please speak freely.”

Wen Qi continued. “Your elixir-refinement skills are good enough. This year’s team competition is full of unknown factors and to be safe, there is no need to have another medicine faculty student on the team.”

Wen Qi was referring to Yun Chen.

The team needed to have someone who knew alchemy, but since Ye Qingtang was already very good at elixir-refinement, there was no need to bring along a helpless medicine faculty student who might end up being a burden.

Ye Qingtang looked at Wen Qi. “Vice-President…”

Wen Qi thought that Ye Qing would be reluctant to leave out Yun Chen.

“Yun Chen is a good kid and he will be able to prove himself in the alchemy competition. So there is no need for you to risk his life in the team competition.”

In response, Ye Qingtang only said simply, “Yun Chen is at the Divine Lord stage.”

Wen Qi, “…”
