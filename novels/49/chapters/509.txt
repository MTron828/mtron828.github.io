Chapter 510 Blood Moon Sect Branch Master (1)

“Chop the heads of those two people first,” commanded the elite disciple.

Upon hearing the order, the Yunxiao Sect disciples dispersed instantly and charged towards Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder from all sides.

Hiss.

Suddenly, the sand on the ground flowed slowly. Almost in the blink of an eye, it formed a pair of shriveled hands like that of a devil’s and launched at the Yunxiao Sect disciples.

Caught off guard, many disciples were grabbed by the ankle. “What is this thing?!”

The Yunxiao Sect disciples were appalled. The more they struggled to break free, the more the powerful was the grip of the shriveled hand. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Clank!

Immediately, one of the inner sect disciples unsheathed his sword and used all his primordial qi to slash at the shriveled sand hand.

However, this strike ignited a spark instead. The shriveled hand of sand was as sturdy as steel and was not chopped off while that inner sect disciple stumbled backward from the impact.

Buzz!

A strange sound blared. Then, the shriveled hand of sand gripped on the Yunxiao Sect outer sect disciples tightly and dragged them into the sand immediately.

The expressions of the Yunxiao Sect disciples changed upon the sight of the scene.

Before long, the sand below their feet finally resumed to its usual tranquility as though nothing ever appeared.

“Set the Extreme Dust Formation!” The elite disciple shouted sternly.

Swiftly, all the Yunxiao Sect disciples took out a white cloud flag each.

A blinding light erupted from the cloud flags.

As the light faded, it formed a large, golden screen that enshrouded over everyone.

Not far away, the Blood Moon Elder scoffed in his heart as he watched the Yunxiao Sect disciples launch a big move. He subsequently turned to look at Ye Qingtang, who was walking ahead of him, and confusion and puzzlement filled his eyes. “Strange…”

This wilderness was a dead zone, and any outsiders who entered it would definitely be buried here.

Yet, why did the Blood Moon Forbidden Curse in the wilderness not attack Ye Qingtang?

On the other side, the Yunxiao Sect disciples who had set up the Extreme Dust Formation were not as lucky as Ye Qingtang.

“There is something unusual about this place. Chop Ye Qingtang’s head off in the shortest time possible and then return!” The elite disciple ordered.

But before the Yunxiao Sect disciples took any action, there was a tremor in the ground.

Below their feet, quicksand flowed across slowly, and a blood tide surged from within the quicksand.

“Tsk tsk…”

A sinister laugh sounded from the blood tide, causing one to shudder in fear.

“Who is that!” A Yunxiao Sect outer sect disciple looked at the blood tide in the air and shouted strictly.

“Tsk tsk… How reminiscing… Yunxiao Sect…” The blood tide in the air swiftly condensed and turned into a ghastly elderly whose entire body resembled blood.

There was an extremely intense smell of blood—as though it was a sea of blood—on the elderly, which evoked fear. Immediately, the leader of the Yunxiao Sect disciples sized him up with a frown.

“You are…” The elite disciple’s expression was increasingly complex as he scanned the elderly, and ultimately, his eyes suddenly dilated. “Blood Moon Sect… One of the one hundred and eighty Branch Masters, Blood Demon Branch Master!” Although the Blood Moon Sect had been annihilated for a thousand years, no one would forget the times when this land was ruled by the Blood Moon Sect.

At the Blood Moon Sect’s peak, there were one hundred and eight branches and one hundred and eight Blood Moon Branch Masters. On top of that, there were thirty-six Blood Moon Division Heads, twenty-four Blood Moon Elders, and three Blood Moon Guardians.

In that era, everyone was frighteningly powerful, and the entire land would tremor when they stomped on the ground.

Blood Demon was one of the one hundred and eight Branch Masters who cultivated demonic blood powers!
