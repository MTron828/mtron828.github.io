Chapter 971 The Match (3) Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

By the time the burning flames dispersed, Duan Luoning was rather pale. He squinted at Dan Yifan, who was facing him. His previously relaxed attitude had vanished long ago.

This Dan Yifan’s abilities far exceeded his expectations.

One should know that a few months ago, Duan Luoning had fought with the Eldest Young Master of the Si Family, Si Ye. He had defeated the latter without even drawing his sword.

He had thought that he would not be forced to use his weapon to deal with Dan Yifan. But who could have guessed…

“What’s the matter? Can’t take it?” Dan Yifan raised his brows and looked at the ashen Duan Luoning. His eyes were filled with arrogant amusement.

“You’re pretty good. You thought you could block me with your bare hands? You’re just too arrogant.” Dan Yifan commented.

Duan Luoning narrowed his eyes slightly. “I was merely letting you have this move.”

“Oh? You’re pretty full of yourself.” Dan Yifan laughed softly. “How dare you!” Duan Luoning was enraged by the disdain in Dan Yifan’s words. He immediately lifted his sword and slashed at Dan Yifan.

Dan Yifan responded deftly but unhurriedly.

Duan Luoning was disadvantaged within three to five moves. He was unable to even defend himself against Dan Yifan’s attack.

The scene playing out before them confounded the confident group from the Duan Family.

They had thought that Duan Luoning could easily defeat Dan Yifan. Who would have thought that… events would take this turn.

“You from the Duan Family, weren’t you very arrogant just now? How come you don’t dare to even fart now!” The group from the Ye Family saw that Dan Yifan had easily beaten Duan Luoning, such that the latter could not even defend himself. They felt thoroughly vindicated.

Did the Duan Family dare to continue being arrogant?

What were their skills compared to Dan Yifan?!

The watching citizens were awed by what they saw.

They thought that Duan Luoning’s abilities were already the best among the younger generation. Who would have thought that… they were nothing compared to Dan Yifan of the Ye Family.

No wonder…

Rumor had it that this Dan Yifan was considered a genius from young.

“Is that all you are capable of…” Dan Yifan looked at Duan Luoning, who was sweating profusely, and his lips curved in a mocking smile. With that, he suddenly leaped up. The inner qi in his body suddenly dispersed, and he seemed to be shrouded by burning flames.

The next instant, Dan Yifan suddenly brandished the Blazing Sun Sword in his hand. The burning flames that surrounded him seemed to gather.

Suddenly, the roar of a dragon rang out from Dan Yifan’s sword breath. The burning flames that had gathered on his blade solidified into the shape of a huge dragon. The burning dragon opened its huge mouth and charged at Duan Luoning.

The air was distorted by the baking heat of the burning hot flames.

Duan Luoning was only in time to see a red glow surround him, but he could not react in time.

Boom, boom!!

A huge explosion suddenly pierced everyone’s ears.

The burning dragon smashed into the dais. Sparks flew everywhere. Duan Luoning’s figure flew pathetically off the dais and smashed into the pillars of the martial arts arena. He fell to the ground with a crash.

At that moment, Duan Luoning’s body seemed to be burnt by flames. His clothes were all burnt black, and a large part of his face was burnt.
