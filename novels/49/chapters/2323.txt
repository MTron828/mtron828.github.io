Chapter 2324: New Students Report (2)

Ye Qingtang, “…”

Seeing Hang Wenwei’s antics, Ran Mo and Qiu Nan hastily snatched a cup each and fell on their knees before Ye Qing. Even Gong Jinyun did the same. They were now all kneeling in a neat row.

There was a saying that one could never bear to slap a smiling face. By putting up this reverent display, they believed Teacher Ye would never ask them to get lost.

Ye Qingtang felt a headache coming on. In reality, she could teach anyone. These students all had good potential and characters, and so she had no objections to them. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

But before Ye Qingtang could say anything, Lei Yan and the rest were up in arms.

“Master? You can’t just go around acknowledging anyone as your master. This is our Boss. When did he become your master? Get lost now!”

Money, land and women. These were the things people usually tried to snatch or steal. But never had they heard of someone trying to snatch other people’s teachers!

These guys were really shameless.

“Don’t be like that. Brother, we are one big family from now on.” Hang Wenwei grinned.

“Who’s a family with you! You lost to me! Get lost now!” Lei Yan refused to budge.

They would never share their Boss with anyone!

Despite the derogatory treatment, those new students did not show any signs of anger. Instead, they continued smiling. “Yes, we have all lost to you. That’s why we have come to seek your teachings with humble hearts.”

Lei Yan had always prided himself on his thick skin, but now he finally knew what it meant when they said that there would always be someone better than you. These guys had even thicker skins than him.

“I object!” Lei Yan hollered.

Hang Wenwei looked at the raging Lei Yan and added, “It doesn’t matter if you object, as long as Teacher Ye doesn’t.”

Lei Yan, “…”

Standing by the side, Qin Feng looked at Ran Mo with a strange expression. He could understand why the others had come, but Ran Mo was the personal disciple of Wu Fengling. Why was he here?

Ran Mo noticed Qin Feng’s look and smiled, revealing the whites of his teeth. “I have always been a nomad student.”

Wu Fengling was the President of the Netherworld Academy and was very busy. When Ran Mo first joined the academy, Wu Fengling had spent more time teaching him. But thereafter, he would just impart a set of techniques to Ran Mo and then meet up again about half a month later to see how Ran Mo had progressed and offered some more pointers.

Wu Fengling was often not around and Ran Mo had to seek guidance from other teachers instead. So it was apt to call him a “nomad student”.

Qin Feng, “…”

“Boss, aren’t we enough for you? Why do you have to take in others? Are we unable to satisfy you?” Lei Yan gazed tearfully at Ye Qing, hoping that he would change her mind.

Ye Qingtang, “…”

What did he mean by “unable to satisfy you”?

Someone, please shut his mouth!

Luo Sheng was rather amused by the scene.

“Ye Qing, I will hand these little scamps over to you then. You can decide whether you want to keep them.”

Without waiting for Ye Qing to reply, Luo Sheng quickly turned and left.

In this kind of situation, it was better to leave it to them to settle amongst themselves. He wanted no part in it.

Like that, Luo Sheng left but Ran Mo and the rest remained.

Lei Yan and the others looked very aggrieved.

This was supposed to be a happy dinner celebration. With the sudden appearance of so many “love rivals”, they had all lost their appetite!

There was no choice, the decision laid in Ye Qing’s hands. Even if Lei Yan and the rest were desperate to toss Ran Mo and the rest far away, they had to listen to their teacher’s wishes.

Likewise, Ran Mo and his group knew that their fate now rested on Ye Qing’s decision.
