Everyone looked up instinctively and saw that Ye Qingtang was at Disciplinary Hall!

Lu Xiuwen narrowed his eyes upon seeing Ye Qingtang.

Yun Shu looked in confusion at Ye Qingtang, who suddenly arrived.

“Are you here to say anything about Yun Shu’s matter?” The Warden asked.

The warden’s words reflected what many thought. While Ye Qingtang did not interact much with Yun Shu during this period of time, Ye Qingtang was still on good terms with him previously. Now that Yun Shu was in trouble, could it be that Ye Qingtang was here to help him?

Lu Xiuwen swept his eyes across Ye Qingtang, though he was not at all bothered.

Ye Qingtang never participated in the mission with them, so no matter what she said now, Yun Shu’s fate would hardly change.

However…

“Senior Brother Yun’s matter?” Ye Qingtang was slightly surprised. She scanned the Disciplinary Hall and could not help but laugh. “You are mistaken. I am not here to talk about Senior Brother Yun’s matter. After all, my mission was different from theirs. How would I know anything that happened in their mission?”

Quite a number of disciples were taken aback by her words.

She was not here to save Yun Shu?

The warden said, “So what are you here for?”

Ye Qingtang slowly walked up, and when she reached the warden, she suddenly handed a sword in her hand to the warden.

“Warden, I picked up a sword on my way back to the sect. There is a Xuanling Sect symbol carved on it, and I thought that some senior brother must have lost it, so I brought it back together with me. I’m handing it to you to check if there are any clues so that the item can be returned to its original owner.”

Lu Xiuwen’s eyes flickered when he saw that sword.

The warden looked at the sword before him and took it over. When he drew out the sword, there was an obvious, large patch of dried blood stained on the shiny sword. The warden furrowed his eyebrows. “Where did you pick up this sword at?”

“In the vicinity of Beiyue Mountains.” Ye Qingtang replied.

With that said, Su Wan and the rest had a shocked expression.

Was that not where Yun Shu was on a mission at?

Lu Xiuwen’s expression became a little ugly.

“Beiyue Mountains… Why do I remember that the location of Lu Xiuwen and the rest’s mission is around that area?” A random disciple voiced from aside.

Lu Xiuwen’s expression instantly turned even uglier.

Ye Qingtang scoffed in her heart. Catching onto what that disciple said, she looked at Lu Xiuwen and asked, “Oh? Could it be that this sword belongs to Senior Brother Lu then?”

Lu Xiuwen narrowed his eyes immediately and uttered coldly. “Junior Sister Ye, you should not speak carelessly. What evidence do you have to say that you picked up this sword at Beiyue Mountains and that this sword is mine?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The warden frowned as well. “Ye Qingtang, do you have any proof?”

Ye Qingtang looked up, and her eyes quietly fell on the Blood Moon Sect Elder, who was in the crowd. “Senior Brother Zhou should have seen this sword as well.” She immediately darted the Blood Moon Sect Elder a look, signaling him to say something.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder saw Ye Qingtang’s eyes and pursed his lips.

What had it got to do with him?

Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes slightly as her right hand casually held on the sword on her waist and drew it out a little.

“…” The Blood Moon Sect Elder felt a chill. He cursed in his heart and walked up rather unwillingly.
