Chapter 964 Boy Genius (3)

The red glow itself did not scatter after dispersing the sword breath. Instead, it headed straight for the youth from the Duan Family!

The youth from the Duan Family had not expected his sword breath to be broken. He could see a red glow suddenly approach, but before he could react, the red glow struck at him. He only had time to raise his sword and block the oncoming red glow.

However, the red glow smashed down with the force of a huge rock. It fell from above, smashing viciously into him!

The huge impact instantly sent the youth from the Duan Family flying. The sword in his hand broke on the spot. He fell heavily to the ground, and a bloody wound formed on his chest.

Everyone in the courtyard was stunned by this scene. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Dan Yifan’s casual stroke of the sword had heavily injured the youth from the Duan Family!

One must know that this youth from the Duan Family had previously beaten all the younger members of the Ye Family until they were unable to retaliate!

The members of the Ye Family who had been defeated by this youth from the Duan Family finally felt vindicated when they saw their opponent collapse pathetically on the ground.

At that moment, they finally understood how powerful Dan Yifan was!

Even Ye Ling and the elders from the Ye Family could not help but look gratified when they saw this scene.

They had heard Dan Yifan say that he had broken through to the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level One a year ago. But the youth from the Duan Family was also at the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level One.

Although they were at the same stage, they were worlds apart.

The person from the Duan Family had only broken through a month ago, and his foundations were still weak. He had not yet completely grasped the power of the Martial Qi Level One realm.

On the other hand, Dan Yifan was already at the peak of the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level One.

He would probably enter the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level One soon!

Everyone from the Ye Family rejoiced. However, the members of the Duan Family who had accompanied the youth were shocked.

They had not expected to find someone so formidable among the younger members of the Ye Family.

With that, the few members of the Duan Family, who looked so threatening just a moment ago, now looked rather odd. They hurried forward and helped the youth up from the ground.

The youth’s face was twisted with pain. The wound on his chest throbbed with agonizing pain. He lifted his eyes to look at the prideful Dan Yifan.

“Who are you!”

Since when had someone above the level of Martial Qi Level One appeared among the younger members of the Ye Family?

One must know that based on their understanding, the younger members of the Ye Family were at most around Connate Level Six. Where had this person popped up from?

Dan Yifan suavely sheathed his sword. He lifted his chin slightly and looked at the youth from the Duan Family. “Remember me. I am Dan Yifan, the grandson of the Ye Family’s Great Elder. As long as I am here, the Duan Family better not bother the Ye Family.”

“Very well, Dan Yifan. Just wait and see!” The youth panted as he glared at Dan Yifan. With that, he led the others from the Duan Family and slunk out of the Ye house.

After the Duan Family left, the Ye Family disciples, who had been repressing their comments, immediately surrounded Dan Yifan.

“Now that Young Master Dan is back, the Duan Family won’t dare to be so arrogant.”
