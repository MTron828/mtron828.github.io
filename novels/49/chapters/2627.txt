Chapter 2628 That Unparalleled Strike (5)

At that moment, Ye Qingtang was almost certain that the Heavenly Emperor was already invincible. It would probably only be a matter of time before he survived the 10th Heavenly Tribulation. In that case, it would only be a matter of time before the Heavenly Emperor would be able to ascend to the heavens?

However, Ye Qingtang was a little puzzled. Although she did not know what happened in this era, she was certain that the Heavenly Emperor still existed in her own era.

Could it be that her previous conjecture was not right? As the saying went, one could ascend to the heavens only after surviving the 10th Heavenly Tribulation. The most important part of ascending to the heavens was not like what she had imagined it to be…

If the Heavenly Emperor did not survive the 10th Heavenly Tribulation, it would have been impossible for the Heavenly Emperor to exist in Ye Qingtang’s era. On the other hand, if the Heavenly Emperor survived the 10th Heavenly Tribulation and ascended the heavens to the upper realm, the Heavenly Emperor would not be in Ye Qingtang’s era either…

For a moment there, Ye Qingtang was even more puzzled. She did not know what would happen. Ye Qingtang knew very little about the Heavenly Emperor. Moreover, there were very few records of supreme beings like the Heavenly Emperor and Han Cangming.

“Look, the 10th Heavenly Tribulation is about to disperse!”

Before Ye Qingtang could think further, an excited shout snapped her out of her reverie.

Along with their gazes, the divine might of the 10th Heavenly Tribulation had decreased to be nearly on par with the ninth. Moreover, the luster of the 10th Heavenly Tribulation was growing dimmer and was almost transparent. “Is that it?”

In the sky, the Heavenly Emperor was facing the attack of the 10th Heavenly Tribulation. However, this time, the Heavenly Emperor had no intention of dodging. His huge golden dragon body changed rapidly. Before long, the Heavenly Emperor returned to his original form.

The clothes on the upper half of the Heavenly Emperor’s body had already been torn to shreds, and he was covered with streaks of blood. His snow-white long hair was also soaked in blood. He looked like an unprecedented great demon god.

“Boom!”

A loud bang shook the surroundings.

Faced with the full force of the 10th Heavenly Tribulation, the Heavenly Emperor did not dodge at all. He took a step forward, his eyes erupting with a terrifying cold light. In front of everyone, his right palm grabbed the 10th Heavenly Tribulation! “It’s over…”

Ye Qingtang muttered. It seemed that the Heavenly Emperor had indeed survived all the attacks of the Heavenly Tribulation. Then… what would happen next?

From the corner of her eye, Ye Qingtang happened to see a huge shadow behind the thundercloud. And she also saw the huge shadow’s arm rising slightly.

“What is that shadow doing…”

An ominous premonition surged in Ye Qingtang’s heart when she saw that. In the next second, the shadowy right arm blasted towards the Heavenly Emperor. “Be careful!”

Without any time to think, Ye Qingtang shouted at the Heavenly Emperor.

The Heavenly Emperor’s gaze landed on Ye Qingtang. For a split second, he looked confused, but he recovered almost instantly. The Heavenly Emperor quickly retreated and shielded himself with his arm. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Boom!”

A thunderous explosion rang out. A look of shock appeared in the Heavenly Emperor’s eyes.
