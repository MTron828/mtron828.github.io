Chapter 1032 So What If It’s Yunxiao Sect (4)

The two Yunxiao Sect elders were dumbfounded as they looked at Bai Kui and Daoist Zijin in disbelief. Why did the two renowned powerful figures of this mainland suddenly appear in the Ye Family…

Even until then, Elder Gu and Elder Yin were still unaware of what exactly had happened in the Ye Family, and everything that happened was already beyond their comprehension.

“How do you intend to settle these two people?” Daoist Zijin looked at Bai Kui and asked.

Upon hearing that, Bai Kui waved a hand. “You should ask Eldest Young Lady”.

“The two Yin Yang Perfected Lords of Yunxiao Sect came to the Ye Residence to capture Eldest Young Lady and offended the Ye Family. I think there’s no need to ask Eldest Young Lady about these kinds of matters. Let’s just put them to death,” Daoist Zijin said.

As they heard that Daoist Zijin wanted to execute the two of them, Elder Gu’s and Elder Yin’s expression changed drastically.

Even until then, Elder Gu and Elder Yin still did not know what happened exactly and why the situation developed to this stage.

“What do you think, Clan Master?” Elder Zijin looked at Ye Ling and asked.

Ye Ling pondered for a moment and subsequently said, “These two Yunxiao Sect elders are audacious. Let’s execute them as Elder Zijin had suggested.”

If it was in the past, Ye Ling would not even have dared to think about this. However, the current Ye Family was worlds apart from before, and a mere YunXiao Sect was nothing to them.

Both Elder Yin and Elder Gu were completely dumbfounded.

They simply could not understand the drastic change in the Ye Family that seemed to happen in a night: not only did the Ye Family have plenty of insanely-talented young disciples, but Formidable Heavens Dynasty’s Grand Imperial Sire, Bai Kui, and Daoist Zijin even became elders as well…

With just the skills of Elder Bai Kui and Elder Yin, it was enough to contend against Yunxiao Sect. It was also to say that the current Ye Family was simply no weaker than YunXiao Sect. Apart from the foundation of the two parties, the quality of the Ye Family disciples surpassed that of Yunxiao Sect by leaps and bounds, and the cultivation skills of Yunxiao Sect Sect Master might lose out to Bai Kui and Daoist Zijin as well…

When Daoist Zijin waved his right arm, Elder Guy and Elder Yin turned into dust before everyone’s eyes.

As the Great Elder and Second Elder watched the two YunXiao Sect elders disappear, their expressions changed. Even though the current Ye Family was extremely powerful, the inherent mindset of the past still made them feel as though they were in a dream.

Looking at the Ye Family disciples, they were extremely calm as though everything was deserved and right.

After the two Yunxiao Sect elders died, Ye Qingtang finally appeared and came to the field. She did not even have the thought of showing herself to two mere Yunxiao Sect elders.

“Eldest Young Lady.” Elder Bai Kui greeted respectfully when he noticed Ye Qingtang.

“Greetings, Eldest Young Lady.”

The Branch Masters and Yin Yang Perfected Lord of the Si Family bowed hurriedly.

The young talents present all looked towards Ye Qingtang in admiration.

“This is… the Yang Lord?!”

The batch of disciples that Elder Bai Kui brought over looked at Ye Qingtang with eyes filled with surprise and disbelief. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The lady before them was not much older than them and simply seemed like the same age, yet she was already a Yang Lord of a Yin Yang Perfected Lord Seventh Heaven…
