Chapter 676: Ouyang Family Clan (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

However, even if they were confused, no one dared to question as everyone knew that the Ouyang family clan’s Young Miss was bad-tempered and obstinate. If they made her unhappy, they probably would not even know how they died.

The Blood Moon Elder and Ye Qingtang entered the Ouyang family clan together. Upon hearing the news, the housekeeper immediately brought people to welcome them.

“Please forgive us for not welcoming you earlier as we did not know you were returning today, Young Miss. Do pardon us!” The housekeeper welcomed her respectfully.

“Mhm.” The Blood Moon Elder nodded arrogantly.

“This is…” The housekeeper instinctively looked at the beautiful young man beside Ouyang Qian.

The Blood Moon Elder’s face darkened immediately. “Do I still need to tell you who I bring back?”

“I don’t dare, don’t dare… I’ve overstepped my line.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“You better not dare. Where’s my fa… father?” The Blood Moon Elder was a little awkward when he mentioned the word “father.”

“The Qin family’s Eldest Young Sir is here for a visit today. The Family Master is in the hall right now.”

“Qin family’s Eldest Young Sir?”

The Blood Moon Elder was not very clear about the Qin family’s Eldest Young Sir and looked towards Ye Qingtang instinctively.

However, a cold glint suddenly flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

She only told the Blood Moon Elder about the relations of the people in the Ouyang family clan and forgot that Qin Chen existed.

Qin Chen was the son of Qin Long, the current premier of the Nine Nights Dynasty.

Although the Nine Nights Dynasty was controlled by the Nine Nights Royals on the surface, the Emperor suddenly became seriously ill a few years ago and could not preside the political affairs. As such, he had to pass his position onto his young son who was only five years old back then. The premier, QIn Long, was appointed as a Supporting Minister to help the new Emperor in presiding over the political affairs.

However…

No matter how intelligent a five-year-old kid was, he definitely did not have the ability to control the court.

Although Qin Long was a premier, he secretly controlled most of the power in the Nine Nights Dynasty with the excuse that the Emperor was young, and he even cajoled the young Emperor to fully believe in him. Currently, the Nine Nights Dynasty was gradually descending into corruption and chaos, and this was mostly related to Qin Long’s control.

Qin Chen was Qin Long’s only son and was very doted on by Qin Long. Moreover, Qin Long had planned to form a marriage alliance with the number one family clan, Ouyang family clan, and he thus wanted Qin Chen to interact more with Ouyang Qian.

When Ye Qingtang knew Ouyang Qian back then, Ouyang Qian and Qin Chen were extremely close. From what she knew, when Ouyang Qian drugged her, it was Qin Chen who helped Ouyang Qian get the drug, and it was also him who told Ouyang Qian about Ye Qingtang’s Heart of the Demon God.

Ye Qingtang did not expect that he would actually bump into Qin Chen here. She secretly gave a look to the Blood Moon Elder for him to not act rashly, which he understood immediately. He told the housekeeper. “Alright. You can retreat first. I’ll just go to the hall myself later.”

The housekeeper did not dare to defy orders and obediently led the people away.

Looking at his current stance where “every word carried weight,” the Blood Moon Elder was increasingly comfortable, seeming to return to his arrogance when he was in his peak back in the years.

Now, it seemed that there were benefits in seizing Ouyang Qian’s body.

After all, the Ouyang family clan’s position was not ordinary, and Ouyang Qian was deeply doted on by the Ouyang Family Clan Master, Ouyang Jian. In the Nine Nights Dynasty, it could be said that she could have anything she wanted…

When the Ouyang family clan servants left, Ye Qingtang immediately notified the Blood Moon Elder of Qin Chen’s identity, though she naturally hid the fact that Qin Chen wanted to seduce Ouyang Qian.
