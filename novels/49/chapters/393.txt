Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang could finally take a break after the challenge of Life and Death Ring. However, the disappearance of the silver wolf made her speechless.

There was no sign of the silver wolf coming back even after a few days, and Ye Qingtang had a weird feeling.

It seemed like…

The silver wolf would not come back this time.

Ye Qingtang felt dismayed by the feeling. She could not help but sigh as she stared at the little lightning dragon in her hand. She still decided to try her luck to look for her silver wolf in the inner sect.

The incharge of the Sword Spirit Workshop was sitting outside and smoking an opium pipe. His eyes sparkled as he saw Ye Qingtang walking over. He immediately went over.

“Little girl”

Ye Qingtang, who did not see any trace of the silver wolf, was feeling a little upset. She turned her head instantly when she heard someone calling her and saw the incharge of the Sword Spirit Workshop walking towards her.

Ye Qingtang was shocked.

That day, she used the black gold meteorite iron by luck. Did the incharge realize his lost and decide to find trouble?

“Little girl, I haven’t seen you for days at the Sword Spirit Workshop.” There was a rare smile on the incharge’s old face.

Ye Qingtang stared the incharge peculiarly. His attitude was weird today.

This guy was always very arrogant. How come today he was so kind to her?

Did he not come to ask her to return the dagger?!

“Little girl, I’m so glad to meet you today. We’re forging a longsword now. Since you are so interested in forging, join me to take a look?” The incharge smiled and asked, but he did not reveal his inner thoughts.

The incharge always wanted to meet Ye Qingtang again after witnessing her forging ability previously. However, it was not appropriate for him, as an incharge of the Sword Spirit Workshop, to look for an inner sect disciple.

Today, he finally met her by chance. How could he just let her go?

Ye Qingtang was confused by the invitation. Before she could figure out anything, she was dragged into the Sword Spirit Workshop by the incharge.

The temperature in the workshop was high. A few blacksmiths were standing around a huge forging table and discussing something.

“The temperature that the cold iron needs is too high. If we add cold water, the difference in temperature may break the sword. I don’t support in doing so.”

“The thickness of the sword is too small. If we do not reduce the temperature on time, the shape will differ. Then all our previous effort will be wasted.”

“We can’t take the risk. Anyway, I don’t agree with the usual ways to cool down the sword.”

The blacksmiths were arguing constantly. They did not even realize that the incharge brought Ye Qingtang over.

Ye Qingtang scanned through the furnace beside the forging table. There was a half-forged sword toasting in the fire. The shape of the sword had been formed, and the edge of the sword was extremely thin. The shadow of the flame could be seen through the edge, though it was burning in the flame.

“What is this?” Ye Qingtang asked the incharge curiously.

The incharge explained. “This is the Broken Ice Sword that we forged using these few days. It uses thousand-year-old cold iron as the material. The body of the sword is very thin, and the edge is even thinner.”

Ye Qingtang felt a little surprised. She did not visit the Sword Spirit Workshop before in her previous life. She only heard that the blacksmiths inside had very high standards. However, the half-forged Broken Ice Sword showed the skills of the blacksmiths.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com
