Chapter 2319: President (1)

“Faculty Head Gu was speaking the truth. Several months ago, Qin Feng’s cultivation had declined to the Paragon Eight Heaven level,” the middle-aged man said.

“Oh?” The elder raised his brows slightly.

“But not long ago, Vice-President Wen Qi accepted a new teacher and assigned Qin Feng and a few other students to him. It was just a few months ago and I never expected… their powers to have increased by so much.”

On hearing that, the elder’s eyes glowed softly.

“Who is this new teacher?”

The middle-aged man pointed at Ye Qing who was standing below the platform.

The elder looked in that direction and saw a mediocre-looking, skinny youth. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“His name is Ye Qing. You were not in the academy over this recent period and don’t know that he autonomously brought some students out of the campus without telling anyone. He has caused quite a bit of commotion in the academy,” the middle-aged man reported objectively.

“Everyone always gets bogged down by the details. So what if it was an autonomous move and he didn’t tell anyone? As long as it can unleash the potential of those students, where’s the wrong in that?” The elder chuckled.

“Indeed.” The middle-aged man nodded.

At this moment, Luo Sheng was hurrying back with Wen Qi in tow. They were startled by the sight of the elder standing near the front.

“You have returned?” Luo Sheng looked at the elder in surprise.

The elder smiled. “The two of you have also come? That’s good, it is getting late. Everyone would probably go hungry if this match continues. Come with me.”

Wen Qi and Luo Sheng exchanged looks but they obediently followed without any fuss.

The elder said to Wen Qi after a few steps. “You rascal, you have rather good judgment.”

Wen Qi smiled. Realizing that it was Qin Feng and Ran Mo fighting on the platform now, his heart gave a sudden jolt. But seeing that the elder was still calm and Qin Feng was holding his own, his smile deepened.

…

This was the most challenging opponent Ran Mo had ever faced in his life. For the first time since he could remember, he was covered in wounds. Of course, he knew that Qin Feng would also have his fair share of injuries.

But the two of them were still fighting stubbornly, neither of them willing to concede defeat.

“Alright, the two of you. Stop.”

A deep, resonant voice rang out across the arena.

Ran Mo and Qin Feng appeared to freeze the moment the voice sounded. They were unable to move.

All the teachers were also startled by that voice and they immediately turned toward it.

The elder in white was strolling over with Wen Qi and two teachers in tow. In the next second, all those who saw the elder immediately hurried forward to welcome him.

“President, you are back?”

The elder was indeed the President of the Netherworld Academy, Wu Fengling.

A sliver of respect arose in Ye Qingtang’s eyes when she saw Wu Fengling.

Wu Fengling was the current President of the Netherworld Academy. But even in her former life, Ye Qingtang had heard many legends about Wu Fengling.

During a major catastrophe, Wu Fengling had protected tens of thousands of students all on his own. He eventually died in the battle but up until his very last breath, he refused to budge and continued to protect the teenagers behind him.

This was a President who deserved the highest level of respect, but Wu Fengling was not in the academy when Ye Qingtang had first arrived.

“Master!” Ran Mo’s face stiffened when he saw Wu Fengling. He felt sheepish when he realized how pathetic he must look.

Wu Fengling didn’t head over to the high stage. Instead, he walked onto the battle platform and looked at the two teenagers with a smile.

“You little scamp. Have you been skiving again and not cultivating properly while I was away?”
