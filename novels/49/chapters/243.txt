Chapter 242: Marry (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang was utterly dumbfounded as she stood rooted to the ground in a trance. Looking at the emotionless Han Cangming, she almost began to suspect whether that statement was really said by this man, who had abstinence written all over his face.

“Your Highness uh… what did you say?” Ye Qingtang seriously suspected that she was hallucinating because she was too nervous in the battle just now.

“You. Marry me.” Han Cangming repeated in a rare case of good temper.

“…” Ye Qingtang felt that she was going to faint.

The Palace Lord of Antiquity Palace wanted her to marry him?!

Your Highness… how hard are you on yourself…

Ye Qingtang instinctively turned around to look at Lin Long, who had long frozen at the spot.

At that instant, Lin Long felt that the entire world crashed internally. She looked at the horrified Ye Qingtang and then at the indifferent Han Cangming, and then silently lowered her head, choosing to ignore Ye Qingtang’s eyes which pleaded for help.

Junior Sister Ye, it’s not that I don’t want to help you.

It’s just that…

This person is a really big shot!

Lin Long never expected for things to develop in such a strange direction.

There was not one person who did not know about Han Cangming. In this world, no one could come close to him, and even the Sect Master of Xuanling Sect had to give Han Cangming a full bow should they meet. But it was this god-like person who came so unexpectedly… This was a blessing of several lifetimes for others.

However…

Just by looking at her junior sister’s anguished expression, Lin Long sensed with certainty the mental breakdown of Ye Qingtang.

Despite that, she still had no choice.

That was Han Cangming!!

The legendary noble and aloof Palace Lord who was a Paragon actually asked her junior sister to “marry” him!

Lin Long’s views were all crumbled.

After seeking help but to no avail, Ye Qingtang almost went insane internally. Before she managed to turn around, she suddenly saw a shadow looming over her surroundings, blocking the moonlight and enveloping her tiny frame in it.

Ye Qingtang turned around swiftly and met with Han Cangming’s beautiful eyes that were just a few inches away from her. Her body froze, and her heart was in her mouth instantly.

She instinctively wanted to take a step backward, but after meeting Han Cangming’s deep eyes, it was as though roots grew from her feet, planting her right into the ground without any ability to move.

The little dragon man from aside looked on the “intimate interaction” between its Would-be Father and Mother with eager eyes and wagged its tail crazily.

“Muacks muacks muacks muacks~ Muacks muacks muacks muacks~” It puckered its lips anxiously, and its eyes twinkled as it watched the two people who gradually got closer. It almost dashed forward to knock Ye Qingtang and Han Cangming’s head together for them to have a heated kiss.

Ye Qingtang saw the little dragon man’s expression and really wanted to slap this reckless little fellow to the ground.

Muacks your head!

So much for calling me your mother. Don’t you know there’s a lethal Heart of the Demon God in your mother’s body?

What is this Han Cangming’s identity? It was the orthodox Paragon!

If the Heart of the Demon God was discovered, you can just wait to bawl your eyes out at my funeral!

God knows how much Ye Qingtang wanted to escape right now and stay away from Han Cangming, this dangerous person, as far as possible. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Marry him?

Impossible, alright!

Han Cangming looked at Ye Qingtang’s dodging expression, and his brows gathered to a slight frown.

That small reaction from Han Cangming fell into Ye Qingtang’s eyes, and she broke out in a cold sweat from fear.

Ordinary people did not even have a chance to see Han Cangming, but she actually dared to ignore Han Cangming’s request to “marry” him!
