Chapter 1035 Return to the Sect (3)

After killing all the ignorant YunXiao Sect disciples, Ye Qingtang’s eyes slowly landed on the defense barrier around Xuanling Sect.

This barrier was implemented by her cheap little brother, the Blood Moon Holy Lord, whom she was extremely grateful for. Had he not appeared in the end back then, even Ye Qingtang would be uncertain of how the situation would have progressed.

What she could be certain of, though, was that Xuanling Sect definitely would not have persisted until today.

In Xuanling Sect, there were Ye Qingtang’s good friends such as Qin Huan and Yun Shu, her Master, Elder Mo, as well as Elder Qin, who treated her rather well…

However, it was a pity that the Grand Elder was no longer here today.

Ye Qingtang did not have any hatred toward the Grand Elder. From a certain aspect, the Grand Elder was even more authentic and human.

In Xuanling Sect.

Qin Huan, Yun Shu, and others were gathered in a corner.

It had been several months since they had been trapped in Xuanling Sect. The blood-colored screen above Xuanling Sect gradually dimmed and was staunchly different from its initial state.

Moreover, the masses trapped in Xuanling Sect were almost running out of supplies.

The Xuanling Sect disciples and senior executives had been taking their food and drinks from within Xuanling Sect, and all of the stockpiles were stored previously.

However, these supplies were almost depleted after nearly half a year, and there were barely any water sources remaining.

Currently, the disciples in Xuanling Sect did not even have water to clean themselves with, much less have food to fill their stomachs.

About a month ago, a few Xuanling Sect disciples took the risk and left the barrier formation, wanting to avoid the Yunxiao Sect disciples and search for water. However, they were discovered eventually and died in the hands of the Yunxiao Sect disciples.

As sect disciples, they could bear with not having water to wash up. However, not consuming food over a long time was not what they could withstand given their martial cultivation realm.

Compared to the Xuanling Sect disciples, the elders and senior executives were naturally much more powerful in terms of martial cultivation, and thus, their need for food was much smaller. Although the elders and senior executives had already taken out their own food and distributed to the disciples, it was still unable to solve this critical situation.

Many Xuanling Sect disciples were nearing the borders of insanity due to the lack of water and food.

Yet despite so, no one dared to leave the defense barrier ever since those Xuanling Sect disciples who left it were tragically killed by the Yunxiao Sect people. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Ah…”

Qin Huan looked at the pale Yun Shu beside him and sighed. “I wonder how Junior Sister Ye is doing.”

At the mention of Ye Qingtang, Yun Shu and Lin Long opened their eyes instantly. The few of them missed Ye Qingtang dearly, but they were trapped within Xuanling Sect for almost half a year and simply could not get any information from the outside world.

“Junior Sister Ye will definitely be fine,” Lin Long said.

Qin Huan shook his head. “That may not be so. I heard that Junior Sister Ye was listed onto the Assassination Roll by Yunxiao Sect. It’s said that the reward surpassed the total rewards for killing the first and third person on the list…”

“Qin Huan, can’t you wish some good for Junior Sister Ye?” Gu Yanqiu rolled his eyes at Qin Huan and said helplessly.

“Nonsense. Of course, I wish for Junior Sister Ye to be safe and sound, but what I said is the truth. Junior Sister Ye treated Yunxiao Sect that way previously and caused YunXiao Sect to lose face… In addition to such tempting rewards, I’m afraid Junior Sister Ye is having a hard time.”
