Ye Qingtang, “…”

Pulling the wailing Lei Yan off herself, she looked at him in disdain. At the same time, Qin Feng and others also looked at Ye Qing with eyes filled with dismay. They never expected Ye Qing to be so angry as to do something like this. What could they do now?

Ye Qingtang felt a headache coming on.

“You guys don’t need to participate in the individual martial arts competition. What you need to do now is to prepare yourselves for the team competition.”

“Team competition?” Lei Yan immediately stopped his wailing. He looked at Ye Qing in confusion.

“You guys don’t have much chance of winning the martial arts segment, so the Vice-President and I have arranged for our team to focus all our efforts on the team competition. Do you understand now?” Ye Qingtang was really scared of Lei Yan’s piercing cries. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The teenagers heaved a sigh of relief at Ye Qing’s words.

“Boss, so… none of us will be participating in the individual martial arts competition?” Jing Ze asked cautiously.

Ye Qingtang nodded.

Yun Chen asked, “What about me?”

“All competitors in the alchemy competition compete at the same time. You just head over when the time comes.” Ye Qingtang did not intend for Yun Chen to give up his alchemy competition.

After all… The alchemy competition would not damage his physical well-being.

Jing Ze and the others had no objection to Ye Qing’s arrangements. They would do whatever their Boss said.

All was fine as long as Boss wasn’t angry.

The reactions of Hang Wenwei and the others were more complicated. They had been under Ye Qing for a shorter period of time and were still unsure of his temper. Although they found his arrangements somewhat unusual, they were now all under her lead. Anyway, Wen Qi had assented to this so there was nothing left to object.

Moreover…

Ye Qing was right. After seeing the other students in the North Hall, they knew that their powers were not on par. Their chances of winning in a one-on-one sparring match were practically abysmal.

Apart from Ran Mo and Qin Feng, there was no way the others would even come near the top 10.

Meanwhile, the drawing of the lots for the Inter-Academy Competition kicked off with a bang. Some of the teenagers were thrilled with their lot, some were dismayed.

For the next few days, the Inter-Academy Competition progressed at a red-hot pace. Countless sparring matches were carried out one after the other.

Adrenaline and glory bloomed in every battle.

In the first few days, the Netherworld Academy’s inferior situation was not yet noticeable. The Netherworld Academy teachers and students didn’t bother themselves about it then. But as the competition progressed, the Netherworld Academy’s inferior position became increasingly clearer.

More and more Netherworld Academy students could be seen nursing injuries and recovering from their defeats in the North Hall.

In just a few days, the entire Netherworld Academy was nearly utterly defeated. Only a few managed to cling onto the latter stages of the sparring competition. Things were not looking good at all.

At first, the Netherworld Academy teachers didn’t discover any anomalies. But after observing the matches over the past few days, they realized…

None of Ye Qing’s students had participated in the sparring matches.

Even Ran Mo and Qin Feng never showed their faces a single time.

“Vice-President, we need an account of what is happening!” Several teachers sought out Wen Qi in anger. Even when Wen Qi explained that Ye Qing and his team were focusing on the team competition, it was to no avail.

“Without Ran Mo and Qin Feng, it would just be a couple of days more before all of the Netherworld Academy students would be eliminated from the martial arts competition. We will be the laughingstock of the entire Inter-Academy Competition!”
