Chapter 1041 Who is Afraid of Who (1)

If not for Ye Qingtang, Xuanling Sect would probably already have been annihilated by Yunxiao Sect half a year ago.

Ye Qingtang did not reply.

Her eyes were devoid of warmth as she looked at the countless tombs in the surroundings. She would personally take revenge for these disciples who died tragically.

Ye Qingtang left after staying in Xuanling Sect for a day, and she was at the Imperial City the next time she appeared.

Yunxiao Sect was located within the Imperial City of Formidable Heavens Dynasty. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Eldest Young Lady.”

Bai Kui and Daoist Zijin greeted Ye Qingtang with reverence outside the Imperial City.

All the senior members of the Ye Family were dispatched in this operation. The seven Yin Yang Perfected Lords, including Bai Kui and Daoist Zijin, as well as the disciples were all present.

Ye Qingtang had made up her mind to destroy Yunxiao Sect completely this time no matter what it took

“Alright.” Ye Qingtang swept her eyes across the army of people. Excluding herself, this force of the Ye Family was sufficient to overpower Yunxiao Sect substantially.

Currently, Yunxiao Sect had not warred against the Ye Family but already had heavy losses: five elders were killed by Ye Qingtang, and even Yunxiao Sect’s most important combat force, the Sect Protector Divine Beast, was also slain by Ye Qingtang.

“Eldest Young Lady, do you still need to make any preparations?” Daoist Zijin looked at Ye Qingtang and asked.

“No,” said Ye Qingtang.

A mere Yunxiao Sect did not have any qualifications to make her prepare anything. Although Yunxiao Sect’s foundation was strong, it posed no threat to a Yang Lord no matter how strong it was.

Moreover, Ye Qingtang would not give Yunxiao Sect any time or chance to activate their foundation.

At this instant, a group of guards at the Imperial City saw Ye Qingtang and the rest and originally wanted to stop them. However, after seeing Bai Kui, all of them were dumbfounded, and no longer had any intention to stop them.Visit website our Listnovel.com

Bai Kui was Formidable Heavens Dynasty’s Grand Imperial Sire and a Yin Yang Perfected Lord Third Heaven figure…

Once the guards returned to their senses and wanted to greet the Grand Imperial Sire, they realized that the troop of people had already entered the Imperial City and were nowhere to be seen.

About fifteen minutes later, Elder Bai Kui led Ye Qingtang to the periphery of the Imperial City.

Right ahead was Yunxiao Sect.

Although a super sect like Yunxiao Sect had nothing to do with the Formidable Heavens Dynasty, it was situated within the Imperial City, and thus, Elder Bai Kui knew something about it.

“Although Yunxiao Sect’s foundation is powerful, it is nothing to you, Eldest Young Lady. However, it’s said that one of their Sect Protector Divine Beast seemed to have advanced recently, and its combat power is rather high,” Elder Bai Kui said.

“I have already killed that Sect Protector Divine Beast,” said Ye Qingtang.

Elder Bai Kui nodded and was not surprised at all.

No matter how powerful that Yunxiao Sect Protector Divine Beast was, it was as weak as a piece of paper before a Yang Lord and could be easily killed without much effort.

A cold glint flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes as she looked at Yunxiao Sect ahead.

Swoosh!

Numerous Ye Family war flags flew in the air.

“Kill!”

Daoist Zijin shouted sternly.

Along with Daoist Zijin’s orders, countless powerful auras surged to the sky and instantly enveloped Yunxiao Sect in them.
