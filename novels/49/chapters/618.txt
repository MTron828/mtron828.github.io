Chapter 619: Little White Tiger (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Fellow, how dare you… snatch away all the demonic aura that I absorbed in the Hell of Avicinaraka… You’re a shameless and lowly chap!” The little white tiger glared at Ye Qingtang angrily, wishing it could tear her into pieces. If looks could kill, Ye Qingtang would probably have died millions of times.

Ye Qingtang was truly surprised by the turn of events. Currently, the demonic aura on the Fiendcelestial Beast had faded, and its body turned into its real infant-form. Hence, there was nothing for Ye Qingtang to be scared of.

As she looked at the little white tiger’s body, she suddenly realized something.

This Fiendcelestial Beast was indeed an infant as rumored. It was, however, that this Fiendcelestial Beast seemed to be able to absorb the demonic aura in the Hell of Avicinaraka, thus causing it to grow quickly. Just based on the demonic aura it absorbed, it skipped over its infancy stage.

However, after this demonic aura was sucked away by the Demon God, the Fiendcelestial Beast returned to its original size and became an infant once again…

Roar!?The little white tiger roared angrily. However, this roar was no longer as imposing as before and instead seemed like a childish cry.

“Ha…” As Ye Qingtang stared at the Fiendcelestial Beast before her, her lips curled up slightly and formed into a devilish smile. “What do you wish to do?”

“F*ck you!” The little white tiger shouted. “You lowly chap. How dare you steal my demonic aura away… I finally shook away the infancy period with much difficulty… F*ck you…”

The white tiger panted and clenched his teeth. This appearance was a drastic contrast from before, and it seemed more adorable instead.

“If you curse at me again, I’ll thrash your mouth,” Ye Qingtang said with a smile.

“Thrash my mouth?” The little white tiger scoffed. “F*ck you!”

Pow!

As the little white tiger just spoke, it was slapped by Ye Qingtang.

“F… F*ck you!” The little white tiger retreated a few steps and cursed again.

Ye Qingtang walked forward and swung her palm down.

Pow!

…

“F*ck you, f*ck you!” The little white tiger did not admit defeat and cursed repeatedly.

Pow!

Pow!

Ye Qingtang did not spoil it and gave another two slaps.

“F*ck you! I’m a Fiendcelestial Beast. Do you know what a Fiendcelestial Beast is?” The little white tiger was completely dumbfounded. It was the first time in his entire life it was slapped by a human!

“Offspring of a Celestial Beast and a Fiend Beast and possesses the Godfiend bloodline. This is a Fiendcelestial Beast,” Ye Qingtang said with a smile.

“You… You know it, yet you still dare to hit me!” The little white tiger shouted.

“You cursed at me, so I hit you,” Ye Qingtang said logically.

“F*ck you!” The white tiger scolded again.

Pow!

Ye Qingtang waved her hand.

“I’ll fight it out with you, lowly chap!!” With a roar, the little white tiger immediately jumped up and darted towards Ye Qingtang.

However, it crashed on Ye Qingtang’s calf.

Ye Qingtang was completely unhurt while the little white tiger fell on the ground and rolled a few rounds like a furball before finally coming to a stop. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“How? Do you still want to continue?” Ye Qingtang said with a smile.

“I…” The little white tiger pondered for a moment and said. “Forget it. I’m a man of my words… We previously agreed that I’d spare your life if you defeat me… Okay, you can get lost. Remember, don’t let me see you again in the future. I’ll show mercy today and spare your life!”

“Oh?” Ye Qingtang found it a little funny that she was threatened by a little baby tiger.

If it was before, Ye Qingtang would be afraid of it, but currently, the little white tiger which returned to its infant-form had no lethality before her.
