Chapter 2690: Mysterious Land (2)

However, at present, there were no traces of the Paragon relic at all. They had not seen anyone from the other factions and did not even know where this place was. It was useless to think too much.

“Junior Sister Ye Yue, should we enter the ancient city to investigate?” Wan Rong asked Ye Qingtang after a while.

Ye Qingtang pondered for a moment before nodding her assent. “Alright, let’s go in and take a look.”

Even the Absolute Heaven Saint did not know what the situation in the Fourth Domain was like. They would have to figure it out themselves.

“Junior Sister Ye Yue, you guys go to the ancient city to take a look. I’ll explore the outside and gather intelligence. I’ll also try to see if I can obtain any information about the Paragon relic,” said Xie Jun softly.

Actually, Ye Qingtang also had this intention. In this place, they were like headless flies with no information or clues at all. With Xie Jun’s skills, it was not a problem for him to scout around.

“Senior Brother Xie Jun, the priority is to scout for information. If you encounter disciples from the Dragon Emperor Clan and the Heavenly Saint Cult, remain in the shadows,” Ye Qingtang instructed Xie Jun.

Xie Jun smiled when he heard Ye Qingtang’s words. He knew what Ye Qingtang meant.

“Junior Sister Ye, I will definitely consider the bigger picture.” Xie Jun continued smiling.

“Junior Sister, why don’t you let me go… Xie Jun has too many enemies,” Lan Shan said hurriedly.

“No need. It is better for Senior Brother Lan Shan to be with us.” Ye Qingtang shook her head.

Xie Jun was quite unreliable, but so was Lan Shan. She might as well have Xie Jun scout around.

“Haha, Lan Shan, you might have even more enemies than me. It’s better for you to stay here.” With that, Xie Jun instantly flew into the sky and disappeared without giving Lan Shan a chance to speak.

Ye Qingtang and the rest walked towards the ancient city.. From their previous high vantage point, the ancient city appeared not far off. However, after landing on the ground, it took them 15 minutes to reach the outskirts of the ancient city.

The city walls were already crumbling, scarred by the sands of time.

The group entered the ancient city.

However, not long after they entered the ancient city, Ye Qingtang’s expression changed and disbelief flashed across the eyes of Lan Shan, Wan Rong and the others.

There were many shops in the ancient city. Inside the shops were a dazzling array of rare treasures.

“Is this for real?!”

Lan Shan rushed into a shop and his gaze landed on the many divine weapons on the wall.

“Clank”!

A sharp blade was unsheathed. Lan Shan waved his hand and drew a fiery red longsword from the scabbard.

“Scarlet Flame Divine Sword?!”

One of the disciples from the Great Immortal Temple cried out in amazement. The Scarlet Flame Divine Sword was a Heaven-level divine weapon. It had once appeared on the Divine Weapon Rankings!

“It’s really a Heaven-level divine weapon…” Ye Qingtang muttered with a strange expression.

“This… am I dreaming?” Lan Shan was still in disbelief.

Immediately, several disciples of the Great Immortal Temple stepped forward and hurriedly picked up the many divine weapons hanging on the wall.

Everyone exchanged looks. There were a total of seven divine weapons and the quality of every single one of them was at the Heaven-level! Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

All these seven divine weapons were also ranked on the Divine Weapon Rankings. Anyone could tell with a single glance.

“This… don’t tell me that before the Fourth Domain was destroyed, even such an ordinary shop was openly selling Heaven-level divine weapons?” Wan Rong was astonished.
