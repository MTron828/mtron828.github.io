Chapter 1163: Supplying Spirit Energy (3)

Whether it was a blessing or a curse would depend on whether the spirit energy supplied exceeded what the cultivator could tolerate.

For example, after Perfected Xuanchen broke through to the peak of the Seventh Heaven of Yin Yang Perfected Lord, his body was unable to tolerate any more spirit energy. That was his limit, but if he was forced to continually absorb spirit energy for further breakthroughs, he would explode and die. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Grandfather…”

When little You Yun saw how pale Perfected Xuanchen was, she thought that she had done something wrong. She pursed her lips, and her eyes were misty with self-reproach.

“Little You Yun is a good girl… Grandfather is fine. Grandfather is so grateful to little You Yun…” Perfected Xuanchen’s eyes were emotional. He had never imagined that he could become a Yang Lord in this lifetime.

When she saw little You Yun’s self-reproachful look, Ye Qingtang could not help but chuckle. She hugged little You Yun and spoke to her gently.

“Little You Yun has done very well. Grandfather is fine.”

Little You Yun looked at Ye Qingtang with some bewilderment and then looked at Perfected Xuanchen before slowly nodding.

“I really must thank little You Yun… I have actually… managed to become… a Yang Lord!” Perfected Xuanchen was all smiles. If he had not experienced it himself, he would never have believed that he could have gone from the Third Heaven of Yin Yang Perfected Lord to the peak of the Seventh Heaven of Yin Yang Perfected Lord, to become a Yang Lord within half a minute.

It felt like a dream or a fantasy. It was surreal.

However, Perfected Xuanchen swiftly suppressed his emotions and turned to look at Ye Qingtang. “Qingtang… since little You Yun can control spirit energy and send it into my body… that means that she can do the same… to create Yang Lords!”

“That’s right. From a certain perspective, that is certainly true.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

“In that case, in our Falling Sky Valley, including the Ye and Si Families… if we all become Yang Lords… no, if everyone in this mainland becomes a Yang Lord… then we will have nothing to fear from the Ancient You Clan of Central Mainland!” Perfected Xuanchen became more and more agitated when he thought of this possibility.

When she saw Perfected Xuanchen’s agitated look, Ye Qingtang shook her head and said, “Theoretically that’s true, but it is impossible in reality.”

“It is impossible in reality?” When he heard Ye Qingtang’s words, Perfected Xuanchen was taken aback. “Why?”

“Master, you could break through to the realm of Yang Lord because your martial talents and mental state were sufficient,” Ye Qingtang said seriously.

“Even so, you reached the limit at the peak of the Yin Yang Seventh Heaven. If you had forced yourself to break through to the Eighth Heaven, it will be very dangerous, and you might explode.

“It is the same for everyone else. For an ordinary disciple, their limit would be a Yin Lord like you. If they were forced to break through to the level of Yang Lord, they might be in danger.

“They cannot become Yang Lords unless they all have a superior martial talent and mental states. Also, ordinary people who have never cultivated before and Connate level cultivators cannot tolerate too much spirit energy.”

Although this method was good, it was limited by the cultivators themselves.

Perfected Xuanchen understood after hearing Ye Qingtang’s explanation.

An ordinary person who had never cultivated before could not tolerate spirit energy filling their bodies, while those at the Connate level were not at a sufficiently high level of cultivation. They had not even reached the threshold of martial arts cultivation and could not tolerate too much spirit energy. For them, becoming Yang Lords was a mere fantasy.

When he realized that, Perfected Xuanchen could not help but feel disappointed.
