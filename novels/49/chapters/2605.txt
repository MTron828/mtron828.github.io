“Sister Ye Yue, leave quickly...” Feng Wuyin came to Ye Qingtang’s side and pulled her sleeve with his small hand, staring at her.

Ye Qingtang looked at Feng Wuyin and asked, “Wuyin, they want to capture you to be a blood sacrifice. Aren’t you afraid?” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Of course I’m afraid...” Feng Wuyin did look a little scared, but he said resolutely,” But I can’t implicate everyone... and I definitely can’t implicate Sister Ye Yue. I’ll go and explain things to them. Everything will be fine! ”

Ye Qingtang opened her mouth as if she wanted to say something but remained silent in the end.

“A cultivator from the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain... ha, how many cultivators from the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain have come to the Divine Venerate Domain only to end up with their tails between their legs? Yet, you have the guts to ask us to listen to you. Why? Don’t tell me you have a noble

bloodline?” One of the powerful fighters from the Feng Yun family sneered at Ye Qingtang.

In this person’s opinion, the vast majority of the martial arts practitioners in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain were just a joke.

“Kill her. No need to waste words.” The white-robed elder from the Feng Yun family commanded in a frosty tone.

However, before the Feng Yun family fighters could make a move, Feng Wuyin hurriedly said, “Wait, wait a moment. Don’t hurt Sister Ye Yue or the rest of the Feng family. I’l leave with you, okay?”

Feng Wuyin grabbed Ye Qingtang’s sleeve tightly and wiped the sweat off his forchead.

“There are many people in your Feng family, but not a single one of them is sensible.” The white-robed elder from the Feng Yun family snorted. “Alright, I can let bygones be bygones. However, this person from the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain is so arrogant after coming to the Divine Venerate Domain.

she must be severely punished. We can spare her life but we will break her hands.”

“Don’t break Sister Ye Yue’s hands!” Feng Wuyin’s face was filled with anxiety.

Ye Qingtang smiled at Feng Wuyin and said, “Wuyin, you gave me a jade pearl previously. I’ve decided to give you a gift in return.”

“Ye Yue, you’re an outsider. This has nothing to do with you. If you don’t want to die, shut up immediately. You’re just a cultivator from the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain. Why don’t you take a look at your own status? Who are you to interfere in our matters?!” Feng Cang pointed at Ye Qingtang and shouted.

The Feng family patriarch glanced at Ye Qingtang. Although Feng Cang had his own selfish motives, what he said was not wrong. Ye Qingtang came from the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain. Even their Feng family could not fight off the Feng Yun family. Wasn’t Ye Qingtang just courting death

“Miss Ye... leave quickly... you are a guest of the Feng family. We don’t want anything to happen to you. Our Feng family will do our best to settle this matter!” The Feng family patriarch said to Ye Qingtang.

“Dream on.” The white-robed elder snorted. “You can leave, but we must break her arms first.”

The powerful Feng Yun family fighter, whose sword had been intercepted by Ye Qingtang’s two fingers, shouted angrily. He tried to withdraw his sword, but after expending nearly all his strength, the sword remained between Ye Qingtang’s fingers and did not move at all.

Ye Qingtang stared at the Feng Yun family fighter impassively. She had not wanted to attack.

“Crash!”

There was a loud crash. No one saw what happened exactly. All they saw was that Feng Yun family fighter being sent flying through the air like a piece of paper..
