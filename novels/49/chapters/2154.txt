Chapter 2155: He Must Have Taken Drugs (2)

Lei Yan quietly shook his head. This teacher was indeed a useless piece of trash. He couldn’t even protect his own students. Luckily he didn’t stay behind back then.

Nangong Lie, who had followed Ye Qing over, also had a strange expression on his face. But he remained silent.

Ye Qing patted Jing Ze’s shoulder. “Go on, have a good sparring session with this student.”

Jing Ze was stunned. For a moment there, he was unable to comprehend Teacher Ye Qing’s words.

Zhang Qiqiu chuckled.

“Jing Ze, your teacher has already spoken. Don’t tell me you dare to go against your teacher’s orders?”

Jing Ze looked somewhat nervous. He had never been a match for Zhang Qiqiu. Now, Teacher Ye wanted him to spar with Zhang Qiqiu. What was going on?

“Go ahead.” Ye Qing glanced at Jing Ze.

Jing Ze did not understand what Teacher Ye’s intentions were but he trusted him, so he stepped forward. The crowd couldn’t resist sniggering when Jing Ze stepped out.

It was no secret that Jing Ze was the weakest student in the Netherworld Academy. But he dared to spar with Zhang Qiqiu? Wasn’t he just asking for it?

Stepping forward smugly, Zhang Qiqiu sized up Jing Ze with a challenging look. He then spoke to Ye Qingtang, “Since Teacher Ye asked me to do this, I will naturally obey. But accidents often happen during sparring. Don’t blame me if he gets hurt.”

In response, Ye Qingtang only said mildly, “No problem. Even accidental deaths are considered common in sparring.”

Everyone was dumbstruck by this Teacher Ye’s words.

Was Teacher Ye permitting Zhang Qiqiu to kill Jing Ze?

Whose teacher was he?

Jing Ze pursed his lips, a conflicted expression on his face. He had no idea why Teacher Ye was doing this. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

He was no match for Zhang Qiqiu.

“Jing Ze’s doomed. This teacher is a madman. It’s Jing Ze’s bad luck to meet such a crazy person.” Lei Yan shook his head, secretly relieved that he didn’t stay under Ye Qing.

“I won’t hold back then.” Zhang Qiqiu chortled as he stared straight at Jing Ze.

Jing Ze took a deep breath but his face was full of fear. The fight had yet to begin and he already looked like he had lost.

“Jing Ze.” Ye Qingtang suddenly called out.

Jing Ze turned.

“Remember everything I taught you,” Ye Qingtang said.

Jing Ze nodded hesitantly.

“Today, I will give you another piece of advice.” Ye Qingtang looked at Jing Ze.

“An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.”

Jing Ze was taken aback. Before Jing Ze could recompose himself, Zhang Qiqiu had thrown a punch at him.

It was a powerful punch and Jing Ze ducked clumsily. Zhang Qiqiu’s attack went through empty air. When the punch landed on the ground, the entire arena vibrated with shattered rock and dust flying everywhere.

The punch of a Paragon level practitioner was enough to bring down mountains and part the seas. If this punch had landed directly on Jing Ze, all the bones in his body would instantly crumble to dust.

“Zhang Qiqiu is really gunning for Jing Ze’s life!” The crowd gasped.

Many people felt that Teacher Ye was going too far. Even if he didn’t want to stand up for his own student, he didn’t need to hustle him to his death.

Jing Ze’s face took on a bizarre expression when he saw Zhang Qiqiu’s all-out attack.

Onlookers felt that he had dodged rather clumsily. But Jing Ze knew that his former self would never have been able to even duck. His former self would never have been able to track Zhang Qiqiu’s movements. But now... he could see all his moves clearly.

A strange feeling rose in Jing Ze’s heart.
