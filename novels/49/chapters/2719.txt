Chapter 2720: Five Great Relics (1)

The previous shopkeepers all behaved like they had no autonomous thoughts. The skeleton in this hall appeared different.

After rubbing its hands together, the skeleton walked to their side. “Come, come, don’t be shy. Take a look around.”

“Eh, this shopkeeper seems to be different from the others.” One of the Great Immortal Temple disciples stared at the skeleton in surprise.

The skeleton chuckled. “Kid, you have good observation skills. We are completely different.”

“How are you different?” Lan Shan asked curiously.

“Haha, good question. I am the remnant soul of the Fourth Domain’s Perfected Immortal, the Heaven Ascension Sect Master. The things outside are just transformations of divine powers. They’re not worth mentioning,” the skeleton explained.

“The remnant soul of the Heaven Ascension Sect Master?!”

Everyone looked at each other in shock.

Although they had not seen the Heaven Ascension Sect Master, they had heard about him in the memory. He was one of the top experts in the Fourth Domain.

“So this Fourth Domain legacy is the Heaven Ascension Sect Master’s legacy?” Ye Qingtang asked with a frown.

The skeleton shook its head. “Of course not. If you want to know the truth, you will need to give me cursed points.”

“You require cursed points for that?!” Lan Shan was stunned.

“Of course.” The skeleton nodded. “You need to know the truth, and I need cursed points. There is no free lunch in this world.”

“How much?” Lan Shan asked.

“5,000,” the skeleton stated.

“5,000?!”

The Great Immortal Temple disciples couldn’t believe it. 5,000 was enough to exchange for two Destruction-level divine weapons!

“Okay.”

However, Ye Qingtang agreed.

After deducting 5,000 cursed points from Ye Qingtang, the skeleton said, “This is the legacy of many powerful figures in the Fourth Domain. In this world, there are eight high-tier ancient cities. Each high-tier ancient city contains the ultimate legacy of a powerful figure in the Fourth Domain. You are very lucky. This is the legacy of the Heaven Ascension Sect Master.”

“I see…”

Everyone fell into deep thought after hearing the skeleton’s words.

“Back then, when the Fourth Domain was destroyed, one of the powerful beings was severely injured but he managed to flee the Fourth Domain and left with the legacies of several other powerful beings. Unfortunately, that powerful being died soon after due to his injuries.” The skeleton shook its head.

Ye Qingtang nodded slightly. This was in line with their previous conjecture. However, she did not expect that this legacy was the collective legacies of several powerful figures in the Fourth Domain.

“May I ask… What happened back then?” Ye Qingtang asked the skeleton.

The skeleton stared at Ye Qingtang, sizing her up with a meaningful look for a long time. In the end, it said, “It’s just fate. There’s no need to say so much about it. Let’s get to the main point… Do you want to use your cursed points to exchange for treasures?”

“The Paragon relic, right?” Ye Qingtang chuckled.

“Yes, you are right. But it’s not just the Paragon relics. There are a total of five great relics here,” the skeleton said.

“Five great relics?”

“The first is the Paragon Relic.” The skeleton gave a gentle wave and a white crystal appeared in the hall. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“This is the Paragon Relic. It can suppress the power of all demons in the world.”

Everyone’s eyes flashed when they saw the Paragon relic appear in the air.
