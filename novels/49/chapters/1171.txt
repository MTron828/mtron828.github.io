Chapter 1172: A Collective Battle (5)

Peerless School, Phantom Valley, and Beiming Manor were the three strongest forces of this mainland, but compared to the obscure ancient clan, they were like stones to a mountain. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The martial culture of the obscure ancient clan was very close to that of Central Mainland. If the spirit energy on this mainland was not so thin, this obscure ancient clan probably would not be short of powerful figures in the Arcane Supremacy and even Heavenly Venerate realm.

However, with the restriction of the low-level mainland, one could not be compared to a powerful figure from a high-level mainland even if he was extremely talented. Such was fate.

If the obscure ancient clan was also a force from the Central Mainland, perhaps they could fight against the You Ancient Clan.

“There are still seven cities that have not been attacked on our South battlefield. If even these last seven cities are lost, the Nine Nights Dynasty will fall to them, and it’s equivalent to us losing the entire South region.”

One obscure ancient clan elderly looked at the ancient clan Master and said.

Upon hearing that, the ancient clan Master wore a serious expression. The last seven cities were potent to the entire South region, and the consequences were dire should they be lost to the Ancient You Clan…

They were currently in a life and death crisis. Ye Qingtang listened from the side without interrupting them.

“How is the deployment in the seven cities?” The ancient clan master asked a moment later.

“Among the seven cities, Nine Fantasy City and Heaven City do not have sufficient people, and Heaven City’s situation is particularly serious… There are ten young talents of the Ancient You Clan, with three of them guarding outside the city. Several figures who charged forward either sustained heavy injuries or were killed. Mo Feng was killed by one of those Ancient You Clan talents.”

The ancient clan Master fell silent.

Ye Qingtang had heard of the South battlefield situation from the Peerless School Sect Master.

Mo Feng was the youngest talent of the obscure ancient clan. He was less than fourteen years old but had already become a Yang Lord. However, he died in the war outside Heaven City three days ago, and this was a great blow to both the obscure ancient clan and the South battlefield.

“Lord, Heaven City requires the deployment of powerful figures the most. Can Peerless School Sect Master or Phantom Valley Sect Master be deployed?” The ancient clan elderly asked.

Upon hearing that, the Peerless School Sect Master took a step forward and said, “The three mighty forces are currently guarding Sky Eagle City, and it is already a heavy toll on us. I’m afraid we are unable to leave and head to Heaven City for assistance.”

All the powerful figures who were guarding each city could hardly look after themselves currently and did not have any energy to assist any other cities…

After a few breaths later, that ancient clan elderly looked at Ye Qingtang and observed her. “This lady is rather skilled at Yang Lord Eighth Heaven. She can head to Heaven City.”

Ye Qingtang did not express her opinions. Everyone else in the hall was much clearer of the South battlefield’s situation than her, and if there was a need, she would be bound to her duty.

“This is Miss Ye Qingtang. She is one of the Yang Lords of our mainland and is extremely skilled.” Peerless School Sect Master explained.

Upon hearing that, the Beiming Manor Chief looked at Ye Qingtang coldly.

This lady annihilated Beiming Manor’s subsidiary force, Yunxiao Sect, and even killed one Yang Lord from their Beiming Manor…

“Miss Ye, are you willing to head to Heaven City to support them?” The ancient clan master looked at Ye Qingtang and asked.

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang nodded in agreement.
