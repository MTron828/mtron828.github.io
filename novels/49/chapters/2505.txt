Chapter 2506: Divine Concealment Reappears (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Before the Blood Moon Elder even had time to react, the demon palm which had lost its target seemed to find a new one and it shot towards the Blood Moon Elder.

The Blood Moon Elder’s mind went blank as he saw this and he forgot to hide.

He suddenly felt someone pat his shoulders lightly. The Holy Lady and big yellow dog quickly reappeared in front of him.

Not only that, the demon palm which was targeting him again stopped as well.

“Holy Lady, what’s happening?” The Blood Moon Elder was deathly pale. He had almost been frightened to death!

Ye Qingtang looked at Blood Moon Elder, deep in thought. She had just been testing something out. She was wondering why she could bring the Blood Moon Elder and the big yellow dog into the Divine Concealment Spell.

But now she understood.

The Blood Moon Elder and big yellow dog could hide their presence as well because she was touching them while under the spell.

It was exactly the same as how she could bring people into the Deity Ocean space as long as she was touching them.

But she still had no idea how to decide whether to enter the Deity Ocean space or use the Divine Concealment Spell when she was making contact with the Deity Ocean.

She didn’t know if there were other powers in the Deity Ocean other than the Deity Ocean space and Divine Concealment Spell.

...

At that moment, the distance between the demon palm and Ye Qingtang’s crew was extremely close but it was unable to lock onto them, which made the Blood Moon Elder breathe a sigh of relief.

“Your Deity Ocean is pretty good,” the big yellow dog who was laying in Ye Qingtang’s arms suddenly said.

Hearing it say that, she looked at it.

She had no idea where the big yellow dog came from but it had impressed her. It was able to immediately understand the Divine Concealment Spell as well as its origin.

“Deity Ocean? What Deity Ocean? Holy Lady, you possess the Deity Ocean?” the Blood Moon Elder looked at Ye Qingtang in shock.

The Deity Ocean was not something that anyone could create. It was common knowledge that only those with great power could create it and create another space along with it.

Even though his Holy Lady was extremely powerful, to be able to create a Deity Ocean and even one that was inside of her… this was too surprising.

Ye Qingtang was already used to the big yellow dog knowing everything. As for the Blood Moon Elder, since he was no outsider, she quickly explained the situation around the Deity Ocean.

“So this means… the demon space that we were in previously, that was in the Holy Lady’s body?” The Blood Moon Elder’s expression suddenly changed and he said, “Holy Lady, but if that’s the case, the thousands of demons in the space should worship you as a god. You can rule over all the demons and powerful beings in the Deity Ocean!” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Hearing his words, the edges of Ye Qingtang’s mouth twitched. Of course she knew that. The problem was that she still didn’t know how to control the Deity Ocean. If she could control it fully, wouldn’t she already be able to rule over all the creatures in it and be invincible?

Of course, she wanted this as well but the reality was more difficult.. Furthermore, they should put aside any questions about the Deity Ocean now and focus on their next move.
