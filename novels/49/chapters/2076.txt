Chapter 2077: Powerful Enemies (2)

What exactly in the First Domain could have caught their attention to this extent?

Ye Qingtang couldn’t think of anything else other than Little You Yun and the Spirit of Chaos.

The Ancient You Clan had suffered huge losses this time. Knowing them, they wouldn’t take this lying down. It seemed like they were going to use the same tactic as Ye Qingtang and use the Spirit of Chaos to goad the Heavenly Wolf Sect into action.

Just as she was talking to Mi, a Temple of Shadows guard ran up to report to her in a panic.

“Holy Lord of Shadows, about a hundred meters away, there is a huge troop of soldiers and horses rushing towards us! We also saw several Ancient You Clan Elders within the troops.”

Ye Qingtang and Mi exchanged glances the moment they heard the news.

“Could you be right?”

“I hope that I’m wrong.”

The faces of the eight tribe leaders darkened. They were all from the Second Domain, so of course, they knew of the Heavenly Wolf Sect. The Crimson League was formed by the top powers of the Second Domain but the Heavenly Wolf Sect consisted of all the villains.

The Heavenly Wolf Sect was made up of countless murderers and people with no regard for the rules.

And they were all extremely powerful.

The strongest, fiercest, and most powerful of them all was the leader. It was not an exaggeration to say that their reputation in the Second Domain was terrifying.

This was a group that was difficult to deal with.

“That shouldn’t be possible... right? What does the Ancient You Clan have to offer the Heavenly Wolf Sect....” the Demon Tribe Leader said.

“You’re right. There’s no way the Heavenly Wolf Sect would bother with a power from the First Domain,” the Goblin Tribe Leader said.

Ming Wang looked at the debating eight tribe leaders and said, “There’s no way the Heavenly Wolf Sect would have any interest in the Ancient You Clan but they would definitely be interested in the Spirit of Chaos.”

And they were going up against the Crimson League, which they were already in conflict with. Knowing their character, they would probably take action.

It was not a hopeful situation.

“Could you see who the Ancient You Clan was with?” she asked the soldier.

The soldier replied, “They seemed to be wearing black armor and their helmet is in the shape of a wolf head...” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

This was enough for all of them to surmise.

“It’s the Heavenly Wolf Sect.” Mi’s voice was heavy.

“Bai Zhi, gather our men immediately,” he ordered.

Since the Ancient You Clan was the one who had invited the Heavenly Wolf Sect over, it meant that they already knew the size of their army.

The Crimson League had not brought many people over to the Crimson League this time and would suffer huge losses if the Heavenly Wolf Sect had come prepared.

Bai Zhi didn’t dare waste any more time and went to prepare for the battle immediately.

“If the Heavenly Wolf Sect were to attack us today, they won’t rest until we’re all dead. I didn’t bring enough men this time. If we confront them, it will cause huge losses on our side.” Even Mi, who was usually very proud of himself, couldn’t express any words of confidence.

Since they were old rivals, he knew their way of fighting well.

“Mo Yao, I’ll leave you to take care of the manpower in the Temple of Shadows,” Mi said before leaving.

With the collapse of the Ancient You Clan’s underground world, their power had disappeared and the remaining members had all scattered. As such, the Ancient Clans could finally be at peace. With the huge victory, they had all returned to their original homes, ready to make a comeback.
