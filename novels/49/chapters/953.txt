Chapter 954 Return to Lin Town (5)

Ye Qingtang had obtained this elixir from the Dragon Vein. Besides improving one’s physique and constitution, it could rapidly increase the cultivation level of those below the grade of half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord.

To Ye Qingtang, this type of elixir was so insignificant as to be almost worthless. However, to a family in a small town, it was a priceless treasure.

“Tang Tang, don’t waste it.” Master Si immediately shook his head.

As he had said earlier, he was well aware of his state of health. In his current state, any elixir would be wasted on him.

“Grandfather Si, I have plenty of this type of elixir,” said Ye Qingtang.

“Tang Tang, actually Grandfather’s chronic ailments are very serious. Elixirs no longer have any effect. Now, we can only nurse him,” said Si Ye.

“This elixir can probably cure Grandfather Si’s injuries.” Ye Qingtang did not keep her elixir and handed it over to Master Si.

“Alright, since it’s a token of Tang Tang’s good intentions, Grandfather will accept it.” Master Si took the scarlet elixir from Ye Qingtang’s hand.

“Grandfather Si, eat the medicine.” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“Tang Tang, it is not yet time for Grandfather to take his medicine.” Si Ye looked at Ye Qingtang.

“It doesn’t matter. This elixir can be taken at any time and will instantly cure you,” replied Ye Qingtang

When he heard Ye Qingtang’s words, Master Si did not allow Si Ye to say anything else. He immediately popped the elixir into his mouth.

The moment the scarlet elixir entered Master Si’s mouth, it immediately transformed into a current of air. The next instant, an indescribable burning current of air rushed into Master Si’s limbs, bones, and meridians.

As the burning current rushed in, all the chronic ailments in Master Si’s body were completely washed away. His body and energy were unimaginably improved. His body let out a sound like the popping of cooked beans.

After a long time, Master Si’s color returned to normal. It was no longer as weak and pale as before.

Si Ye was shocked when he saw the surprise on his grandfather’s face. He was rooted to the spot and could not help but call out in alarm.

“This…”

At Si Ye’s soft call, Master Si returned to his senses. He stared at Ye Qingtang in disbelief.

“Tang Tang… this elixir of yours…”

Master Si had never encountered such a miraculous elixir in his life. In just a moment, it had completely swept away all his extremely serious chronic ailments. Even his cultivation level, which had reached a bottleneck many years ago, seemed to show faint signs of a breakthrough!

What kind of miraculous elixir was this?!

“Why? Does Grandfather Si like the taste and want to try it again?” Ye Qingtang was in a good mood when she saw that Master Si had recovered his old self.

“Tang Tang, don’t tease… this elixir is so valuable. Even if you don’t keep it for yourself, how can you casually give it to me?!” Master Si stared at Ye Qingtang, his brow deeply furrowed.

Although Master Si did not know the name of this elixir, its effect was so miraculous that it probably was one of the sect’s original immortal elixirs and a great treasure. It was priceless. Even if the Si Family beggared themselves, they probably could not obtain the elixir in exchange!

Once the chronic ailments in Master Si’s body were cleared, his cultivation became even purer. Besides joy, he also felt an indescribable sense of pity.

He was already so old, yet such a miraculous elixir was wasted on him. Also, Master Si became even more suspicious of where Ye Qingtang had obtained such a precious immortal elixir from.
