Chapter 876 In the Name of the Demon God

Ye Qingtang held Perfected Gu Yun’s space ring in her hand. She frowned and immersed herself in her thoughts.

The value of the space ring was unmeasurable. However, if she could not open it now, it was considered useless.

If she wanted to open Perfected Gu Yun’s space ring, she must enter the second stage of the Arcane Supremacy, which was the Divine Arcane Supremacy, and use the same mental power to destroy Perfected Gu Yun’s mental power. Otherwise, it was impossible. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Maybe Ling Yan can figure out a way…” Ye Qingtang murmured.

…

At the peak of a snowy mountain at the same

time…

Ling Yan was in deep thought as he saw a plant that wilted in a short period of time in front of him.

“Han Cangming…”

A luster flashed across Ling Yan’s eyes after a long while.

What a familiar but unfamiliar name…

“Hahaha, Ling Yan, it’s been a long time!”

An elder’s voice suddenly came from a far place.

Ling Yan looked forward instantly.

An elder slowly walked closer with a silver wolf.

If Ye Qingtang was present, she would be surprised by the identity of the elder. He was Master Du, who was missing for a long period of time!

“You’re here.” Ling Yan smiled and looked at Master Du.

“Haha, I have been here for quite a while,” Master Du said and walked towards Ling Yan.

However, astonishment appeared in the silver wolf’s malicious eyes when its eyes landed on Ling Yan. It sniffed Ling Yan continuously with its nose.

“Ling Yan, do you recognize this silver wolf?” Master Du smiled and asked.

Ling Yan smiled and shook his head, but he did not reply.

“The silver wolf was transformed by the Demon God, Han Cangming,” Master Du said meaningfully.

“Well… Everyone knows the power of the Demon God hundreds of years ago. He was one of the top three strongest people together with the Fiend Honor and Human Emperor. However, everyone thought that the Fiend Honor was a fiend, that the Human Emperor was a human, and that the Demon God was a demon… Ling Yan, do you think the Demon God was transformed from a real demon?” Master Du added.

“Blossom takes a hundred years, and wilt takes another hundred years… He could be a human before the hundred years of blossom and could have become a demon after the hundred years of wilt… None of these matter in this world.” Ling Yan smiled and replied.

“Hahaha Ling Yan, you still like to say such mysterious stuff that other people do not understand. You should know that the Demon God was called by this name just because he had the intelligence of a demon. No one could compare with him. Even the strongest among the three, Heavenly Emperor, was tricked by the Demon God… However, why does the Demon God not have the intelligence anymore today after hundreds of years… Why does he loses his feelings and emotions and only exists as a person with insane martial ability?” Master Du shook his head and said.

“Is it? Then that’s strange.” Ling Yan smiled.

“The Demon God back then was less powerful than the Heavenly Emperor, but he was never at a disadvantage when facing the Heavenly Emperor. During the war at the Eternal Peach Garden, the Demon God was surrounded by thirty thousand people. It was supposed to be a deadly situation, but a few of his casual sentences made the three thousand people, including the Heavenly Emperor, not dare to attack. The Demon God left the place with a sinister smile under everyone’s gaze… By coincidence, I was there as well…” As Master Du was speaking, his eyes constantly sized up Ling Yan.

However, it seemed that Ling Yan was listening to someone else. He showed no emotion or reaction.

“Ling Yan… Don’t you think that it’s strange? The Demon God back then could see through people’s hearts, and he could turn around a deadly situation with a few sentences. Hang Cangming was incredibly striking. How come the Demon God now only keeps the martial ability back then… All his emotions and intelligence is missing, and he is only left with an emotionless body?” Master Du said.
