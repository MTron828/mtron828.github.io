Chapter 485: The Paragon Skill (5)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

There seemed to be indifference in the Divine Phoenix’s eyes as it noticed the situation. It howled, and golden flames soared instantly, melting the ice spike that was charging towards itself. Subsequently, the enormous Divine Phoenix rammed against the abdomen of the Ice God of War fiercely.

Boom!

The attack of the Divine Phoenix caused the Ice God of War to collapse and explode into numerous broken ice shards.

“Impossible!”

As the Ice God of War was shattered, blood seeped out of Ning Luo’s mouth.

His Paragon Skill was understood as a green spirit root and, moreover, belonged to the medium level amongst the Paragon Skills. How could it be defeated by Ye Qingtang’s so-called Paragon Skill…

Ning Luo used his blood as a lead and controlled the Ice God of War with his mind. Thus, after the Ice God of War was shattered, there was serious damage inflicted to Ning Luo’s mind, and he was severely injured.

From afar, Zhu Changge and the other Xuanling Sect disciples were completely stupefied and almost forgot to breathe.

What is that Divine Phoenix…

Ye Qingtang only has a red spirit root. How did she understand the Paragon Skill? And how did she defeat Ning Luo, who was at Martial Qi Level Three and possessed the Paragon Skill, with the skills of a Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two?

“Am I dreaming?” Qin Huan looked at Zhu Changge in confusion.

“May… maybe…” Zhu Changge replied.

“Senior Brother Zhu… How about you give me a slap?” Qin Huan asked with a frown.

Pow!

A resounding slap landed on Qin Huan’s face.

“Does it hurt?” Zhu Changge asked.

“Mhm.” Qin Huan touched his face and pondered for a moment. “It seems… to hurt a little…”

“…” The other Xuanling Sect disciples stared at him blankly.

Whiz!

Without giving them time to think, a loud sound rang.

Ning Luo flew into midair instantly, wanting to flee this place.

The Paragon Skill he used earlier had almost exhausted the primordial qi in his body, and his mind was injured. If he did not escape, he was afraid that he would have to die there today.

“Wish to escape?!” Ye Qingtang laughed coldly. How could he have it as he wished!

In an instant, the golden Divine Phoenix transformed into a monstrous blaze which chased after Ning Luo.

The Divine Phoenix was extremely fast and blocked Ning Luo in just the blink of an eye.

“Damn you, Ye Qingtang!” Ning Luo gritted his teeth and immediately retrieved a signal flare from his space ring.

“Boom”! Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The signal flare exploded in the sky, forming into a certain special symbol.

“Yunxiao Sect’s distress signal?” Ye Qingtang frowned deeply. Ning Luo actually called Yunxiao Sect for help…

“No, I must kill him before the Yunxiao Sect people arrive!” Ye Qingtang pondered.

The coldness in Ye Qingtang’s eyes penetrated through one’s bones as she looked at Ning Luo, who was floating in the sky above her.

As Yunxiao Sect’s hidden spy in Xuanling Sect, Ning Luo had already silenced Fu Lingtian, and the consequences would be dire if he returned to Yunxiao Sect alive.

Once Ning Luo was allowed to return, even Ye Qingtang did not dare to guarantee that she could stop the wheels of history from rolling on the tracks of her current life once again.

At that instant, the Yunxiao Sect signal flare was already sent, and there was no way of stopping it.

“Die!”

Immediately, the golden Divine Phoenix turned into a blaze once again, wanting to devour Ning Luo completely.

As long as Ning Luo died, there was hope for Xuanling Sect’s survival!

As Ning Luo saw the golden blaze nearing him, he did not dare to be careless, and endless cold air erupted from his body to block the attack of the golden blaze.

Boom!

The golden blaze exploded around Ning Luo, and flares shot up the sky.

Ning Luo spat a mouthful of blood instantly and fell on the ground from midair like a kite with a snapped string.
