Chapter 1066 Mirror of Illusions (2)

The two Beiming Manor elderlies did not recognize the Mirror of Illusions in Ye Qingtang’s hand and were not affected by anything; thus, they focused fully on the Secret Sound Sky Spirit Technique.

However, Ye Qingtang used the Mirror of Illusions at this instant.

In the next second, all the unusual sounds actually turned into logs of wood.

The logs fell from the sky and crashed onto the ground noisily.

The scene that played out before their eyes left the two Beiming Manor elderlies completely dumbfounded and in disbelief.

The Secret Sound Sky Spirit Technique actually turned into logs of wood when shone on by Ye Qingtang’s ancient mirror. How could this be?!

“What is that Dharma treasure of yours?!” One of the Beiming Manor elderlies stared at Ye Qingtang and asked in disbelief.

They had never heard of a Dharma treasure which could turn attacks into logs of wood.

However, Ye Qingtang scoffed and did not utter a word. She immediately stored the Mirror of Illusions and turned into a flash of shadow as she leaped forward. Using her palm as a knife, she slashed down at one Beiming Manor elderly.

Noticing the situation, the Beiming Manor elderly grunted in fury, immediately stepped forward, and entered a scuffle with Ye Qingtang

However, this person’s martial skills were only at the late-stage of Yin Yang Perfected Lord Seventh Heaven and was not Ye Qingtang’s opponent. Dozens of moves later, he was already in a disadvantageous position.

Another Beiming Manor elderly joined in instantly. This person’s martial realm was similar to that of Ye Qingtang’s Yin Yang Perfected Lord Seventh Heaven peak.

However, even if the two Yin Yang Perfected Lord Seventh Heaven late-stage and peak cultivators joined forces, they were still on the losing ground and were simply not Ye Qingtang’s opponent.

“How can this be?!”

The two Beiming Manor elderlies were increasingly astonished as they fought. Although Ye Qingtang was at the peak of Yin Yang Perfected Lord Seventh Heaven, her combat powers did not lose to an Eighth Heaven cultivator and were even neck and neck with their Beiming Manor Chief!

In no time, these two Beiming Manor elderlies were severely injured. Should they continue the battle, it would not be of any threat to Ye Qingtang while they would be in a dangerous situation instead.

“Retreat first!”

The two Beiming Manor elderlies exchanged a look, and one of them said with a frown.

After fighting with Ye Qingtang for some time, both of them were fully aware that it was impossible for the two of them to be of any threat to Ye Qingtang in the current situation. They could only leave first and leave subsequent matters to be resolved by the Manor Chief.

If the Manor Chief took action personally and came with their few Yang Lords, this lady could be killed easily…“Humph, little girl… your skills are indeed impressive… However, you have offended Beiming Manor now, and there’s no way out. We will not pursue you anymore today. The situation will change. The next time we meet, I will take your life!”

Afterward, the two Beiming Manor elderlies turned into a flash of shadow and flew towards the sky.

“You come and go as you wish. Do you think it is that simple?”

If Beiming Manor sent all its Yang Lords and the Beiming Manor Chief, even Ye Qingtang would be unable to cope with that. It was best to kill these two Yang Lords here right now!

Swoosh!

Ye Qingtang waved the Regicide Sky Blade, and a scarlet sword gleam with an extremely intense power of the Divine Phoenix bloodline slashed the sky.

One of the wounded Yang Lords was caught off guard and fully bore Ye Qingtang’s blow.
