Chapter 2447: I’ll Bring You To Search For It (2)

Not only that, but this above-Emperor level monster was much stronger than those other ones. It was considered an elite among the above-Emperor level monsters.

“No way, how did it turn into ashes?!”

With that, the big yellow dog sniffed and wagged its tail as it conveyed the message.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang’s mood was indescribable. Would this dog hold a grudge? She had punched it just now. If it did, perhaps she should prepare to escape?

But on second thought, the big yellow dog had insisted that she punch it in the face. The dog had asked for it. Surely it wouldn’t bear a grudge, right?

Just as Ye Qingtang was deep in thought, the big yellow dog wagged its tail and dragged a burnt object to her side.

“Luckily it wasn’t completely burnt to ashes. Have you eaten dinner?” The big yellow dog sat on the ground and looked at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang instinctively shook her head.

“Not eaten… Let’s eat together then.” The big yellow dog dragged the charred object to Ye Qingtang. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“What is this?” Ye Qingtang asked in disdain.

“Oh, I think it’s an arm or a thigh. Otherwise, it’s the stomach or something. If it’s already burned like this, who would still recognize it? I don’t usually eat things like this,” the big yellow dog said seriously.

Ye Qingtang was a little speechless. This fellow… Was it planning to eat the meat of an above-Emperor level monster? It must be kidding.

“Eat quickly. Don’t stand on ceremony, you must be starving,” said the yellow dog.

“No, no, no. You eat. I’m full.” Ye Qingtang was embarrassed. Who wanted to eat such revolting food?

“Then I guess I’ll help myself.” As the yellow dog spoke, it bit the charred… object.

“Pfft, what the heck is this? It’s filled with resentment. It’s too disgusting!” The big yellow dog had a look of disdain.

Ye Qingtang was speechless.

“Do you have food?” The big yellow dog’s gaze landed on Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang immediately took out some food and threw it on the ground.

“Do you really treat me as a dog?” The big yellow dog’s tone was dissatisfied.

“This is beef. Forget it if you don’t want it,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Of course I want it. Who said I’m not eating? But you threw it on the ground for me to eat. Isn’t that an insult to me?” The big yellow dog grunted.

Ye Qingtang replied, “Then what do you want?”

“Take the beef and bring it to my mouth. How about that?” the big yellow dog asked.

Ye Qingtang was stunned. She thought for a moment. Was it asking her to feed it?

“You’re not my dog,” Ye Qingtang said.

“What are you saying.” The big yellow dog wagged its tail. “I’m not someone else’s dog either.”

But she was now at the mercy of this big yellow dog. Its strength was unfathomable, so she had no choice but to be humble.

“The taste is alright, but there’s too much salt. I’m a dog, so I can’t eat too much salt. Help me rinse it first next time,” the yellow dog said.

Ye Qingtang was a little speechless. It had so many requests.

“Oh, right. Don’t you have a master?” Ye Qingtang asked with a smile after the big yellow dog was full.

“What do you mean by that? Can you give me some respect? I’m not a guard dog. I’m…” the big yellow dog muttered.

“What are you?” Ye Qingtang was curious.

“I’m a pitiful dog,” the big yellow dog said.

Ye Qingtang was speechless. What kind of demon was this?

“Then, don’t you have a companion?” Ye Qingtang changed her words.

“I have no companions. I’ve only been awake for three to four days.”

Ye Qingtang was deep in thought. Could it be that this big yellow dog was not lying? It was indeed true that it had been sleeping in the Wailing Well and had only woken up recently.
