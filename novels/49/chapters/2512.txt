Chapter 2513: Return (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

By the time Ye Qingtang returned to her senses, she had already left the Wailing Well and returned to a city.

This was Universe City. It was still a distance away from the entrance of the Wailing Well which Ye Qingtang had entered previously. Perhaps it was because that man broke through the void and shifted the position of the space.

“Holy Lady… where are we?” The Blood Moon Elder looked around and asked Ye Qingtang.

Given that he had just been revived, he didn’t know much about the outside world, especially the Second Domain. There were too many continents, and every single one of them was different.

Ye Qingtang gave a rough explanation to the Blood Moon Elder so that he would know what to do.

“I didn’t expect that I would see the light of day again!” The big yellow dog was excited, wagging its tail rapidly as it sized up the surroundings.

However, as soon as the big yellow dog finished speaking, it quickly fell silent.

This place… Something about it felt not quite right.

“Wait, isn’t this…” The yellow dog had a strange expression as it sniffed the air.

“What’s wrong, Brother Canine? Is there anything wrong?” The Blood Moon Elder looked at the big yellow dog in confusion.

“Why is it like this?” The big yellow dog ignored the Blood Moon Elder and fell into deep thought. It muttered to itself, “No wonder my powers dissipated… lower realm…”

“Boss!”

A shout came from afar.

Ye Qingtang turned around and saw Qin Feng, Mu Ziying and the rest, as well as the various Vice-Presidents of the academies, walking towards them.

“Boss, this is great.” Mu Ziying fell into Ye Qingtang’s arms with an anxious expression.

“I’m fine.” Ye Qingtang smiled and patted Mu Ziying’s shoulder.

“Boss,” Lei Yan said with a grin. “You told us to come out first while you stayed in the Wailing Well. We waited for you for a long time, but you never came out. You scared us to death!”

It must be said that Qin Feng, Nangong Lie and the rest were rather excited to see Ye Qing.

Initially, they thought that something bad happened to Ye Qing in the Wailing Well and were extremely worried. He had stayed inside for such a long time. How could they not be anxious?

“Teacher Ye, it’s good that you came back alive. When are you free, let’s have a drink together.” Lu Yuanxiang walked up with a smile and patted Ye Qingtang’s left shoulder.

Ye Qingtang, “…” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“It’s all thanks to Teacher Ye. Otherwise, none of us would be able to leave the Wailing Well alive. Thank you, Teacher Ye!” The Flying Star Academy teacher cupped his fists at Ye Qingtang.

“Teacher Ye, you sent them away and stayed in the Wailing Well alone. Did something happen? Can you explain the situation?”

A white-haired elder walked forward with a walking stick and said to Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang looked at the elder and felt that he looked familiar. However, she was slightly stunned when she thought about it.

“The ambassador of the Second Domain Academy Alliance…”

Ye Qingtang contemplated inwardly.

The Academy Alliance held an important position in the Second Domain. In her previous life, Ye Qingtang was fortunate enough to participate in a conference by the Academy Alliance. That was where she met this old man.

The Academy Alliance included all the academies in the entire Second Domain and was not biased toward any continent. It was a very powerful establishment.

Ye Qingtang did not expect that the incident at the Wailing Well would alarm the people of the Academy Alliance.
