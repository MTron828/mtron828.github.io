“Junior Sister Ye, leave now. Just ignore me already.” Lin Long held onto her shoulder which was trickling with blood as sweat dripped from her face in pain. She held the excruciating pain back and touched Ye Qingtang’s shoulder.

Ye Qingtang and she were not close, but Ye Qingtang actually chose to stay and protect her in such a hopeless situation.

Shock filled Lin Long’s heart. She never knew that there would actually be such a “foolish” person on earth.

Even that piece of trash Zhou Xuan knew how to save his life, yet Ye Qingtang chose to stay when she clearly had a chance to escape.

So stupid…

So foolish…

But these made her tremble uncontrollably.

Ye Qingtang saw the determination in Lin Long’s eyes, but Ye Qingtang felt another kind of resolution. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

In her previous life, she swallowed humiliation in order to survive and hid from place to place. So many times, she had personally witnessed those who cared for her being killed right before her eyes. In her previous life… she escaped too many times, but in this life… she would definitely not leave any friend behind.

Ye Qingtang suddenly smiled. In such a dire situation, under the moonlight, she smiled.

“Senior Sister Lin, from the day I entered the sect, I remembered this one sect rule.” Ye Qingtang helped Lin Long up slowly and grasped her sword tightly as she looked at the onslaught of zombies.

“We must not leave any disciple behind… Must not!”

An intense murderous expression filled Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

If she abandoned the people she treasured, what right did she have to seek revenge on Ye You!

Lin Long looked at Ye Qingtang’s side-profile in shock as her heart that had been frozen for years suddenly felt a warmth like never before. A lump formed in her throat, and her eyes reddened instantly.

“Well said. If we can get through this calamity, we will…”

Before Lin Long could finish her sentence, the zombies had already reached them.

Even though they were facing a hopeless situation, the two strong-willed girls did not give up on any slightest chance to escape.

Their swords gleamed in the moonlight. In that dark night, the swords in Ye Qingtang and Lin Long hands danced to the sound of death, composing a life anthem that belonged to only the two of them!

The little black ball snuggling in Ye Qingtang’s heart, feeling a strong sense of crisis, suddenly broke free of its constraint and rushed into the little lightning dragon’s body.

Lend me!

Lend me your body!

I want to protect my mother and not allow anyone to harm her!

A piercing dragon roar suddenly sounded. A beam of light shone out from Ye Qingtang’s chest and shot towards those zombies.

Lin Long was a little shocked to see that light while a smile broke out on Ye Qingtang’s face at that instant.

“Little fella, you’re finally willing to move.”

The little dragon man appeared in the night all of a sudden. However, at that moment, there was not a slight trace of a smile on its soft and supple face. Death filled its icy cold eyes. It had a tiny frame, but it blocked in front of Ye Qingtang like an insurmountable mountain!

“Anyone who harms my mother shall die!” A cold declaration with frightening power escaped from its tiny mouth!

It would do whatever it could to kill anyone who dared to touch its mother and slaughter out a path for its mother!

A strong force spread throughout the little dragon’s force. It suddenly leaped up, and the scales on its tail glistened in the moonlight. Turning into a deadly bolt of light, it plunged into the group of zombies!
