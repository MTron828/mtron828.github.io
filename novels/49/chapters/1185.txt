Chapter 1186: Look At The Big Picture (1)

“Haha! Eldest Young Lady, this Ancient You Clan troop left many Dharma treasures in Dragon Elephant City, and this Heaven Soul Gourd is only one of them. Many Black-grade spirit weapons can only be used by people in the Yin Yang Perfected Lord realm. These spirit weapons are numerous, and a portion of them should be ones stolen by the Ancient You Clan from this mainland…” Elder Bai Kui looked at Ye Qingtang and said.

Upon hearing that, Ye Qingtang nodded slightly and said, “Distribute all the Black-grade weapons and Dharma treasures and dispatch some scouts to gain intel on that Ancient You Clan troop.”

“Yes!”

Elder Bai Kui turned around and left.

“Qingtang!”

Just as Elder Bai Kui left, Valley Master Xuanchen and Daoist Zijin rushed over to the hall hurriedly.

“Eldest Young Lady, that team indeed attacked Heaven City by force!” Daoist Zijin looked at Ye Qingtang and informed her quickly.

“Oh…”

Ye Qingtang was in thought after hearing Daoist Zijin. Her guess was indeed right.

“What is the outcome of the battle?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“It is still unclear as of now…” Perfected Xuanchen paused for a while before continuing, “However, Heaven City is easy to defend and hard to attack. Although there are not many powerful figures in the city, it has many natural advantages… If that Ancient You Clan attacks Heaven City by force, it can conquer it, but… they will have to pay a large price too.”

After knowing that the Ancient You Clan troop began to attack Heaven City by force, Ye Qingtang, however, ordered everyone to rest in Dragon Elephant City.

In Heaven City.

A faint light shot into the sky. Screams and roars filled the air.

Many powerful figures arrived at the top of the city walls. With Gu Yu’s orders, thousands of archers released arrows at the numerous Ancient You Clan masses at the bottom at the same time. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Why is… Ancient You Clan attacking Heaven City by force?!” A flustered young powerful figure asked.

“It’s that Ye Qingtang…” An old elderly gritted his teeth and said, “That lady used some means and actually conquered Dragon Elephant City… and even refused to return the city. The Ancient You Clan lost their headquarters and thus displaced their anger on us… Otherwise, they would never attack Heaven City by force!”

“Humph!” Gu Yu sneered coldly. “Send an envoy to Dragon Elephant City immediately and tell Ye Qingtang to return the city!”

“I’ll go,” said a certain young powerful figure.

…

In Dragon Elephant City, a Ye Family disciple entered the main hall briskly and cupped his fists at Ye Qingtang. “Eldest Young Lady, a Heaven City envoy requests for an audience!”

Ye Qingtang was indifferent and spoke a moment later. “Bring him in.”

Soon, the Ye Family disciple led a young powerful figure from Heaven City into the main hall.

Ye Qingtang had some memory of this young powerful figure.

“Miss Ye, you stirred up huge trouble this time!” The young powerful figure wore an exasperated expression as he walked into the main hall.

With the flick of her sleeves, Ye Qingtang turned to look at the young powerful figure and asked coldly, “Oh? What do you mean by that?”

The young powerful figure snorted. “General only wanted you to create a false image of Dragon Elephant City being attacked so that the rations from the headquarters can enter Heaven City successfully. However, you took down Dragon Elephant City and angered the Ancient You Clan people who are attacking Heaven City by force now. How can you bear such a consequence, Miss Ye!”
