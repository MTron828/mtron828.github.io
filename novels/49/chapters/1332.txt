“Holy Lord, I meant that Ling Yan is an intelligent person, many times more intelligent than the Eldest Prince. Why shouldn’t the Temple of Shadows support Ling Yan instead of the Eldest Prince? The Temple of Shadows needs intelligent people more,” Ming Wang said thoughtfully.

“Wrong.” Ye Qingtang shook her head. “The Temple of Shadows does not need intelligent people. When you have absolute power, any plot can be easily broken.”

When he heard that, Ming Wang remained silent for a moment before he said, “The Holy Lord is right. I was overly concerned.”

“You may leave.” Ye Qingtang waved her hand somewhat impatiently.

When he heard Ye Qingtang’s words, Ming Wang turned to leave.

When she was sure that Ming Wang had left, Ye Qingtang broke out in a cold sweat. Her entire body was already soaked in sweat.

Today was just too dangerous. This Ming Wang is not to be underestimated…

If she had not forced herself to remain calm so that Ming Wang could not see through her, she might have lost the secret duel with Ming Wang just now. The consequences were unimaginable.

Ming Wang’s every word was a test of whether the Holy Lord of the Temple of Shadows was authentic or not.

Like his suggestion that they support Ling Yan. If she had agreed, she would probably have paid with her life there and then.

With the Holy Lord of Shadows’s power, she could exterminate the Eternal Dynasty with a flick of her fingers. She had no need to fear Ling Yan’s demonic intelligence…

Even the Zhui Gong incident was something that Ye Qingtang had heard of in her previous life, which was why she could speak about it.

“F*ck, that Holy Son Ming Wang is really formidable.” The little white tiger swiftly poked his head out and leaped onto the bed.

“The Holy Son, Ming Wang, has begun to suspect your identity. Fortunately, you managed to present a calm front; otherwise… you would have already lost your head,” the little white tiger said seriously as it looked at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang did not refute any of the little white tiger’s words.

Ever since she became the Holy Lord of Shadows, the Holy Son Ming Wang had been suspicious of her identity from the moment they met. With Holy Son Ming Wang’s personality, if he discovered the truth, she would immediately die a terrible death…

It was really difficult to pose as the Holy Lord of Shadows…

Just as Ye Qingtang was sighing secretly, she heard another knock on the door.

“Ah Yao…”

Ye Qingtang got up and opened the room door. The Holy Son, Ming Gu, was standing at the doorway. He looked at Ye Qingtang in shock and said, “Ah Yao, I just saw my elder brother leave your room…”

“It was nothing, I was just discussing something with Ming Wang.” Ye Qingtang explained.

Ming Gu was filled with suspicion. He thought that Ming Wang was not coming this time, so why… had he suddenly arrived.

Ming Gu wanted to enter the room and chat with Ye Qingtang, but Ye Qingtang dismissed him, saying that she needed to rest.

Meanwhile, the scheme to force Ling Yan to rebel went forward without any pause.

Right now, Ling Yan’s influence was growing, and General Wu Hu’s power was growing in tandem with his.

Ling Yan’s influence and reputation within the Eternal Dynasty reached unprecedented heights, especially as the Eldest Prince and Second Princess continued to present their weak flank to Ling Yan. Many of the ministers had already secretly signaled their favor of Ling Yan.

At that moment, in the palace of the Eternal Dynasty, in the main hall.

“Royal Father!”

The Eldest Prince kneeled on one knee and gazed at the Eternal Emperor. “The Crown Prince is intriguing to kill the Emperor and seize the throne!”
