Chapter 771 Full Moon Peak (2)

“In Falling Sky Valley, although Liu Mo’s skills are second to you, the gap between you two is extremely wide.” Full Moon Peak Peak Master spoke slowly, but his confidence in his grandson was evident in his tone.

“I’ve never nurtured you as an ordinary disciple.” Full Moon Peak Peak Master told Xuanyuan Lie.

“I understand,” replied Xuanyuan Lie.

His usual cultivation was separated from other disciples, and his cultivation method was personally chosen by his grandfather.

Even those disciples under his grandfather were completely unaware of his cultivation method.

The Full Moon Peak Peak Master nodded slightly and continued.

“Are you bothered by that Ye Chen?”

Xuanyuan Lie said, “I don’t think much of that Ye Chen. It’s just that he is perfected Xuanchen’s disciple. When the old Valley Master wanted to pass the acting Valley master position to Perfected Xuanchen, all the peaks in Falling Sky Valley were very dissatisfied.

“In terms of skills and qualifications, which of them are you not better than Perfected Xuanchen? You’re clearly more suitable to be Falling Sky Valley’s Valley Master than him.

“All of Perfected Xuanchen’s disciples are mediocre, and I haven’t even paid attention to Gu Yihan. Ye Chen is of dubious background and could defeat Liu Mo despite his young age. When Perfected Xuanchen accepted him back then, people already found it strange, and it’s said that Ye Chen is only a yellow spirit root.

“But currently, the skills that Ye Chen displayed does not seem to be from those of an ordinary yellow spirit root. I think that there may be some special relationship between Ye Chen and Perfected Xuanchen. Moreover, just a few days after Ye Chen entered the valley, he sparred with Blue Cloud Peak’s Li Jingwen and Water Cut Peak’s Liu Mo and even defeated them.

“I think that it’s very possible that he did this because Perfected Xuanchen hinted to him in secret and wanted to make use of this to beat us three peaks,” Xuanyuan Lie said coldly.

Blue Cloud Peak and Water Cut Peak depended on Full Moon Peak and were at odds with Perfected Xuanchen.

Previously, the only disciple that Admirable Sky Peak could show off was Gu Yihan.

Moreover, Gu Yihan could contend against Liu Mo at most, but it was insufficient for him to achieve victory.

Ye Qingtang just entered the valley.

But she picked up troubles with the other two peaks successively, which was clearly directed against them.

“Oh?” Full Moon Peak Peak Master raised a brow. “What plans do you have then?”

Xuanyuan Lie scoffed coldly. “Perfected Xuanchen snatched your Valley Master position back then. Since Ye Chen is his disciple, there’s no need for me to be polite with him.”

Did Ye Qingtang wishfully think that she could dominate over the other disciples in Falling Sky Valley?

It was simply delusional.

The Full Moon Peak Peak Master nodded. He did not pay much attention to Ye Qingtang.

However, since his own grandson found the other party as an eyesore, it was not bad to deal with him now.

“Forget it. Just make whatever arrangements you’re thinking of. There’s no need to tell me. You just need to remember that you’re different from all the Falling Sky Valley’s disciples. Your future is to be the Valley master of Falling Sky Valley.” The Full Moon Peak Peak Master hinted.

He did not raise his grandson so painstakingly to let him become an ordinary disciple.

He would take back Perfected Xuanchen’s Valley Master position sooner or later, and he would definitely pass this position down to Xuanyuan Lie in the future. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Xuanyuan Lie’s eyes flickered, and he said immediately, “I understand. Don’t worry, grandfather.”
