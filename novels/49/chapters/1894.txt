Ye Qingtang told Little White Tiger all about her time in the Crystal Palace and witnessing the fat catfish being demonized. In reality, she could not be sure if it was an actual demonization.

“That’s strange. Those spirit stones don’t look like they could be produced by living bodies.” Little White Tiger was puzzled.

Even though it found those spirit stones and fat catfish very strange, there was no way they could resolve their doubts now since they had already left the mystic realm.

“How do you feel now?” Little White Tiger looked at Ye Qingtang.

Little White Tiger felt that Ye Qingtang’s recent breakthrough might not be a good thing.

“Bloated...” Ye Qingtang rubbed her chest. Having slept for so long, she had not consumed anything, not even a drop of water. Even so, she felt extremely bloated, as if a big ball of power was still stuck somewhere in her body, not fully absorbed yet.

“Of course you are bloated. You absorbed so many spirit stones. I estimate that it will take some time before you completely digest all of that energy. The remaining power will probably just continue to linger in your body,” Little White Tiger said.

One bad thing about Ye Qingtang’s sudden breakthrough was the risk of her exploding to death. It was a miracle that she had managed to hold on until now.

Ye Qingtang believed that it was mainly thanks to the Deity Ocean, which slowed down her absorption of the power to a tolerable pace that allowed for her body to take it in. On top of that, her Devouring Bloodline probably also aided her assimilation of all that energy.

Although she was unable to completely absorb everything all at once, she could slowly convert all that energy over time.

This was considered good news to Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang got out of bed and washed up, changing out of her dirty clothes. Since Jiang Shaobai had also brought over some food for her, she finally felt somewhat refreshed.

As they had lingered on this island for quite some time now, Baili Xi and the rest had left long before.

Ye Qingtang didn’t plan to stay much longer on this island. Together with Jiang Shaobai and Little White Tiger, they left the Island of Immortal Footsteps and headed back to Taiyuan Valley.

They travelled quickly, not stopping until they arrived at the borders of Taiyuan Valley.

“Sister Qing, what do you think Jiang Yisheng’s reaction would be... if I told him that his beloved goddess is actually a man?” A sly grin was on Jiang Shaobai’s face.

Ye Qingtang remained silent.

This young fellow had been rather quiet during the entire way home. So it was because he had been nursing such a thought.

The two of them entered Taiyuan Valley with grins on their faces. But the front square of Taiyuan Valley was completely empty. There was no one around at all.

“It’s already late morning, why is there no one out here training? Don’t tell me... the elders are in a good mood and gave everyone a day off?” Jiang Shaobai scanned the surroundings, feeling very puzzled.

On a typical day, the square would be filled with large groups of youngsters training from the moment the sun rose. The elders would also make frequent appearances to make sure no one skived.

But it was all empty today. It was a rare sight.

“Sister Qing, you must be tired. Why don’t you go back to rest first? I need to report to Elder Qian about some matters.” Jiang Shaobai gave Ye Qingtang a wave before scurrying off.

Ye Qingtang was indeed feeling rather tired and made to return to her place to rest. She would then mull over what to do next. But as she walked past the square, Ye Qingtang felt that something just didn’t feel right.

It was too quiet in the entire Taiyuan Valley. Apart from the chirping of birds and scuttling of bugs across the ground, there were no other sounds at all. Ye Qingtang walked on for quite some time but didn’t encounter a single person.

It was strange.
