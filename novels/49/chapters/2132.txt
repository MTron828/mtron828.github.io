“Okay, I’ll arrange for it now.” Di Nuo’s eyes shifted around before he left.

Soon after, Di Nuo found the youth who was busy outside. When the youth heard that Ye Qing had permission from the Vice President to enter the Netherworld Academy, he was stunned.

“Teacher Di Nuo, how is he even fit to become a teacher at the Netherworld Academy? Are you joking?” The youth wasn’t supportive and his expression was filled with discontent.

This Ye Qing’s arrival was bound to diminish the prestige of the Netherworld Academy.

“The Vice President has already decided. As for how long she can stay at the Netherworld Academy, we don’t know yet. Bring Qin Feng, Lei Yan and the others over. He will be in charge of them.” Di Nuo pointed out a few names. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The youth’s expression suddenly changed when those students were pointed out.

“Teacher Di Nuo, you’re handing Qin Feng and the rest to Ye Qing?”

Di Nuo nodded.

“Aren’t Qin Feng and the others going to be expelled from the academy next year?”

“It’s precisely because of that, so we will hand them over to Ye Qing. Did you really think that I’ll let the students receive such lousy guidance from him?” Di Nuo said.

The youth instantly understood what Di Nuo meant and he went to look for them.

...

On the other hand, Ye Qingtang had her own study room after being brought into the Netherworld Academy.

She wasn’t in a rush at all, so long as she entered the Netherworld Academy, she would surely stand a chance to lay her hands on the Wind-Calming Pearl. She didn’t care about anything other than that.

“Teacher Luo, I heard that the Netherworld Academy makes its way to the Eastward Mainland every year?” Ye Qingtang asked Luo Sheng curiously.

The Eastward Mainland wasn’t too far away from the mainland she was at. However, if she wanted to leave the mainland, she would need to use the Wind-Calming Pearl.

“Yes. The Eastward Mainland is one of the mainlands with the most flourishing martial arts culture in the Second Domain...” Luo Sheng didn’t think too much about Ye Qing’s question and just answered.

The Netherworld Academy would select an elite group of students every year and the teachers would bring them to the Eastward Mainland to attend a competition with the other academies. These students had to be the cream of the crop while the teachers guiding them along would accompany them there.

Ye Qingtang had an idea once she heard those words.

The Wind-Calming Pearl was one of the treasures of the Netherworld Academy. Though the Netherworld Academy had more Wind-Calming Pearls than other academies, it was still considered a limited supply. It would normally be under the President’s possession and only when there are competitions then the President would distribute them among the teachers accompanying the students.

This was the only opportunity for Ye Qingtang to use the Wind-Calming Pearl to leave the mainland.

However, she had to make sure that she could actually groom someone who would attend the competition.

That was the least of her worries. Those who could enter the Netherworld Academy would have enough capabilities and talent.

Other than that, if Ye Qingtang were to use the martial arts knowledge from 300 years ago on the students, there would be a multiplier effect.

Right when Ye Qingtang was thinking about it, a youth came to look for her. Ye Qingtang had met him before. It was the youth who tried to chase her away when they were outside of the academy earlier.

The youth entered the room and bowed at Luo Sheng. “The Vice President has given an order. Teacher Ye can try to guide these students along first.”
