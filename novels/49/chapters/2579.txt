Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang looked at the young man before her, Feng Jiuyou. Although she wanted to say something, in the end, she remained silent.

The Heavenly Demon Tribe swept through the Third Domain several generations ago. Even a three-year-old child knew about this, but this young Divine Lord in front of her knew nothing about them. He had never even heard of the Heavenly Demon Tribe.

Coupled with everything that had happened before, including the fact that Han Cangming was about to become the Third Emperor...

Ye Qingtang gradually understood.

This world was indeed the world she was familiar with. However, the only difference was that the era had changed. It was no longer the era she was familiar with.

To be precise, the Ancient God Karma Tunnel had sent her back in time to several generations ago.

In this era, the former Sage Emperor of Swords, Feng Jiuyou, was just a twelve-year-old naive youth who did not know anything about the world. Han Cangming had yet to become the Demon God and the Heavenly Emperor was at his peak.

The whole situation was completely unfamiliar to Ye Qingtang.

This was an era where everything was in full bloom. The peak forces were all vying for supremacy. Opportunities and despair coexisted side by side. Some of the peerless expert practitioners who would go on to be renowned had not even appeared yet. The Heavenly Demon Tribe who would bring about

endless despair had also yet to make their appearance.

This was really... a confusing era. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

A complicated glint flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes. She never expected that she would come to this era one day.

“Do you really not know about the Heavenly Demon Tribe?” Ye Qingtang stared at Feng Jiuyou. She was still a little puzzled. The idea of traveling back in time was truly bewildering.

However, the young Feng Jiuyou just tilted his head and looked at Ye Qingtang. He shook his head in confusion, ‘Sister Qingtang, I don’t know anything about the Heavenly Demon Tribe... I’ve heard of demons, demon beasts... giants and many other races, but I’ve never heard of any Heavenly Demon Tribe.”

Looking at Feng Jiuyou’s pure and naive expression, Ye Qingtang was increasingly certain that the Ancient God Karma Tunnel had indeed sent her to an earlier era.

Perhaps it was hundreds of years ago, or thousands of years ago... or even tens of thousands of years ago... the exact time could not be determined at this moment.

‘Jiuyou, can you tell me more about Han Cangming?” Ye Qingtang looked at the young Feng Jiuyou.

Feng Jiuyou replied, “Han Cangming... I’ve only heard of him. It’s just that his name has been on the rise recently, he was completely unknown in the past. Anyway, I know that he offended the Heavenly Emperor and is now being pursued by him.”

“Understood.” Ye Qingtang nodded. Her expression shifted slightly as she continued to look at Feng Jiuyou. This naive young man in front of her would become an existence that she would highly respect in the future.

Back then, Ye Qingtang read about some of Feng Jiuyou’s achievements and records in the history books and was full of admiration for him. To Ye Qingtang, Feng Jiuyou was simply a legend.

Ye Qingtang never expected to have Feng Jiuyou stand in front of her one day and call her big sister...

“In the future, you will definitely become a super-powerful figure respected by everyone.” Ye Qingtang stared at Feng Jiuyou and smiled.

Feng Jiuyou’s eyes flickered. “Sister Qingtang, I will definitely become an expert.. Although I don’t have a powerful bloodline or genius martial arts talent, what I do have is determination and perseverance!”
