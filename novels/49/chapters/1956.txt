Chapter 1957: Pledging Allegiance (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Up until now, the Ancient Clans all hadn’t understood what kind of an opponent they were facing.

But outside the Ancient You Clan valley today, they had witnessed so many powerful youths that made them feel like nothing in comparison. It was as if they were as insignificant as mere ants. They had turned up one after another and there was no way they would be able to deal with that kind of power and numbers.

As long as they retained the fragments, they would be a target of the Ancient You Clan.

It had become a ticking time bomb.

No matter how good it was, they had no choice but to use their lives to trade for it.

It was not a surprise that the Ancient Clans all had the same thoughts. They understood that the difference between them and the Ancient You Clan was too great and they were powerless to prevent them from taking the fragments of the Spirit of Chaos. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Their only option was to hand it over.

But...

Many of the Ancient Clans here had a grudge against the Ancient You Clan. Their pride didn’t allow them to just hand over the fragments like that.

Not only they, who knew whether the Ancient You Clan would even spare them after they handed the fragments over obediently!

After all...

They were mere bugs in the eyes of the Ancient You Clan right now. The only thing that could oppose the Ancient You Clan now was the Temple of Shadows

The Temple of Shadows had accepted their reliance from the start and had never asked for anything in return. The Ancient Clans saw this as kindness.

Even though they rarely acted based on emotions, they knew that relying on the Temple of Shadows was far more dependable than relying on the Ancient You Clan. Furthermore, they understood how cruel and violent the Ancient You Clan could be.

Ye Qingtang was surprised as she hadn’t expected the clan leaders to hand over the fragments so willingly.

“The Ancient You Clan’s goal is to obtain the Spirit of Chaos fragments in your hands. They can guarantee your safety if you hand over the fragments to them,” Ye Qingtang said.

The clan leader suddenly spoke up. “Holy Lord, do you think that I’m handing the fragment over to save the lives of my clan?”

“Why else would you?” Ye Qingtang asked.

The clan leader smiled bitterly and replied, “Holy Lord, you’re right. My clan has already been forced into such a position and there’s no way we can keep holding onto this fragment or we will die by the Ancient You Clan’s hands. Like the Holy Lord said, handing over the fragment to the Ancient You Clan is an option, but...

“I would much rather hand the fragment over to the Holy Lord rather than the Ancient You Clan.”

“Why?” Ye Qingtang repeated.

“The Ancient You Clan had always been ruthless and only respected the strong. Now that they are this strong, my clan will only be humiliated and trampled all over by them...” the clan elder said bitterly.

The clan elder’s words embarrassed many of the other Ancient Clans.

It was true. They might be able to preserve their lives if they surrendered to the Ancient You Clan. But with the Ancient You Clan’s current and history...

Who knew how low the other Ancient Clans would have to sink...

They would be humiliated worse than slaves or animals.

After all, these Ancient Clans had been around for tens of thousands of years. Even though they knew their current situation, they still could not give up the last of their dignity.

They would rather die than be treated like bugs to be toyed around with under the mercy of the Ancient You Clan.
