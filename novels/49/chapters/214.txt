Chapter 213: Skull Tower (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Junior Sister Ye.” Zhou Xuan suddenly called Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang lifted her eyes slightly. Zhou Xuan’s face was pale as he was disgusted by the skulls. Ye Qingtang’s mouth tilted.

“Junior Sister Ye, this is your first time attending a sect mission. I will not risk your life for some dangerous tasks, but you need some training. The skulls here may contain some clues of the tragedy at the Spirit Condensation Mountain Village. Thus... you must check through every single skull here carefully to look for clues,” Zhou Xuan said in a noble way. It seemed that he really picked the best task for Ye Qingtang wholeheartedly.

The two disciples sneered as Zhou Xuan finished his words.

Frankly speaking, if they took a few more looks at the rotten skulls, they would be vomiting. They would never touch the skull for investigation. Furthermore... the skulls had decayed to the extent that there were little or no clues left at all. They definitely did not want to waste energy on this kind of task.

However...

They were delighted if Ye Qingtang could take the task.

Lin Long frowned upon hearing Zhou Xuan’s words.

Ye Qingtang clearly noticed what a hypocrite Zhou Xuan was. Surprisingly, she did not reject Zhou Xuan’s proposal. She shrugged her shoulder and agreed. “Okay.”

No one expected that Ye Qingtang would agree with that so easily.

Even an adult male might not be able to face the rotten skull tower without fear, how could a young lady be capable of such a feat? However, Ye Qingtang agreed without hesitation.

Zhou Xuan was expecting Ye Qingtang to reject his proposal. His mouth twitched. But when he remembered that Ye Qingtang would spend her time with the rotten skulls, he felt more relieved.

“Thank you for the trouble, Junior Sister Ye.” Zhou Xuan faked a smile and looked towards the Apothecary.

“There are only the skulls of the three hundred people from the Spirit Condensation Mountain Village here. Where are their bodies?”

“The corpses are scattered around the village. I will show you the way.” The Apothecary answered.

Zhou Xuan lifted his eyebrow slightly and took a glance at Ye Qingtang.

“Okay then,” he said.

“Junior Village Master, I’m afraid you have to accompany this lady here to identify these skulls,” The Apothecary said towards Wu Zheng.

The handsome young man who remained silent nodded without any expressions.

The Apothecary then led Zhou Xuan and the rest to other places in the village. Lin Long wanted to stay, but Ye Qingtang shook her head. Lin Long paused for a moment and followed up with Zhou Xuan.

Ye Qingtang chuckled as Zhou Xuan and the rest left.

How could she not know Zhou Xuan’s intentions?

However...

Zhou Xuan wanted to scare her with these rotten skulls, but he would be disappointed soon. What kind of bloody scene had she not witnessed before in the tortures of her previous life?

She even spent days under rotten corpses to hide from the killings.

How could she be scared of a few hundred skulls?

Such a joke.

Ye Qingtang withdrew her sight. She did not bother about Zhou Xuan’s little trick. She only cared about the tragedy at the Spirit Condensation Mountain Village.

In her previous life, the tragedy remained unsolved after two hundred years, and this was Ye Qingtang’s first sect mission. It would not be good news for a new disciple to fail their first mission.
