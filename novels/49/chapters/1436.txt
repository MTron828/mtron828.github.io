1437 Slander 3

“I already said that I insisted on looking for you today. It has nothing to do with You,” Jiang Qin said impatiently.

Like hell she believed that.

Ye Qingtang knew Ye You’s schemes.

“Tang Tang, I know that you are resentful. I always wanted to return this spirit root to you…” Ye You leaned in Jiang Qin’s arms with tearful eyes, which compelled tender affection.

Yet, Ye Qingtang was not moved at all. “Since you are so guilty, it’s hard for me to decline. You can return the spirit root to me today then.”

Ye You was dumbfounded by what Ye Qingtang said.

She really did not expect Ye Qingtang to be so straightforward and crude.

“Ye Qingtang, you’re really evil! You actually want You to destroy her spirit root!” Jiang Qin shouted furiously.

Ye Qingtang smiled in response. “What do you mean by that? Am I not doing this for her good? Ye You said she has been extremely remorseful over the spirit root incident and always wanted to find an opportunity to return the spirit root to me. I saw that she is so guilty, so I might as well go along with her wishes. She won’t need to be guilty once she returns the spirit root, won’t she?”

Since Ye You wanted to play innocent so much, let her act all she wants then.

Ye You’s expression changed subtly. She originally thought that Ye Qingtang would let this matter go because of the Jiang Family’s opinions, yet unexpectedly… Ye Qingtang really wanted her to return the spirit root?

Ye You appeared guilty and sincerely wanted to return the spirit root, but in her heart, there was not the slightest intention to return it.

She had long treated this spirit root as her own.

Ye Qingtang looked at the mum Ye You and said, “Why? You actually don’t wish to return it? Since you don’t, just say it then.”

“It’s not…” Ye You shook her head tearfully.

“Ye Qingtang, that’s enough!” Jiang Qin suddenly interrupted Ye Qingtang cornering.

“You is a child of the Jiang Family and not someone who you can do whatever you want to.”

“Surely she is a child of the Jiang Family?” Ye Qingtang scoffed.

Ye You truly wanted to kill her, and Jiang Qin, who was so protective of Ye You, probably wanted to kill her as well under Ye You’s bewitchment. Even if Ye Qingtang spoke nicely this time, Jiang Qin would not change her attitude toward her and would oppress her even more instead. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Since they were already in a confrontation, Ye Qingtang might as well just have a complete fallout.

“Humph.” Jiang Qin’s eyes swept across Ye Qingtang without bothering to haggle with her. If Elder Xu and Jiang Liu were not present, Jiang Qin would have taken Ye Qingtang’s life immediately.

Jiang Qin was unwilling for Ye You to be harmed any further and immediately led her away.

Ye You’s tear-stained face made her look extremely aggrieved.

Ye Qingtang was about to vomit when she saw that expression.

After Jiang Qin and Ye You left, Jiang Liu had a rather complicated expression.

“Tang Tang, you indeed suffered grievance over this matter. However, since both of you are back in the Jiang Family, let bygones be bygones then. Don’t destroy the sisterhood between you two.” Jiang Liu persuaded.

Regardless of Ye Qingtang or Ye You, both were part of the Jiang Family. Ye You indeed should receive some punishment for stealing the spirit root, but it seemed impossible with Jiang Qin’s protection.

“As long as she does not cause trouble for me, I will not look for her.” Ye Qingtang replied.

Although she had entered the Jiang Family, she was very clear that Ye You had Jiang Qin behind her. While Elder Xu and Jiang Liu seemed to be standing on her side, they were mostly acting in the interest of the harmony of the Jiang Family and definitely would not deal with Ye You for her.

Ye Qingtang still lacked someone’s backing in the Jiang Family.
