Chapter 2090: Clone (3)

This news was...

Simply too much for her to take in now. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Ye Qingtang would be glad to be taken into the Temple of Paragon, if only she wasn’t in such a state. Many powerful people would fight to enter this shrine.

The Six-Winged Fire Phoenix landed outside the palace. Shortly after, a figure came from above, landing in front of the palace.

It was a good-looking, winged being. The white palace made his wings appear even more pure and flawless.

Ye Qingtang had seen quite a number of winged people in the Central Mainland and the Second Domain even in her past lifetime and current lifetime. She knew that once the winged people had achieved a certain level of capability, they would start growing silver-colored feathers in the insides of their wings.

The feathers wouldn’t be noticeable in normal periods, however, when they spread their wings, especially under the sunlight, the insides of their wings would sparkle just like stars in the sky.

Even the most powerful winged person Ye Qingtang had met in her precious lifetime only had three silver feathers.

This winged person in front of her...

Ye Qingtang was about to be blinded by the dazzling feathers in the insides of his wings...

He had a full set of silver feathers!

Everyone from the Temple of Paragon was extraordinary.

“Greetings, Elder Bai. The other Elders and Guardians have been waiting in the main hall for quite some time,” the winged person said politely.

The elder nodded and with a light tap of a finger, a mysterious power compelled her to fly over. The winged person stood aside, lowering his eyes and not daring to look.

The huge palace doors swung open, and Ye Qingtang’s eyes were almost blinded by the dazzling scene before her.

The next moment, she appeared in an enormous palace. She couldn’t recall exactly how she entered the palace. Scanning the room covertly, she tried to look behind at the palace doors behind her.

However, all she could see was rays of bedazzling light.

Was this...

A parallel universe?

Ye Qingtang was taken aback.

After experiencing the Deity Ocean’s twisted space, Ye Qingtang could sense a transfer between time and space, and she had sensed the same feeling earlier on.

The Temple of Paragon’s palace appeared to be built on the peak of a mountain. However, this door... seemed to connect to the parallel universe.

Ye Qingtang was astonished. How much power did they require to be able to transform a parallel universe into a powerful palace and control time and space?

It was no wonder no one knew a thing about the Temple of Paragon. Even if they risked their lives and climbed onto the peak of the mountain to barge into the Temple of Paragon, they would be completely ruined by the parallel universe’s twisted power after opening the door...

Ye Qingtang could already sense the terrifying difference between the Second Domain’s most powerful forces and the First Domain’s powers shortly after stepping into the Temple of Paragon’s main hall.

The disparity between the two was colossal, to the extent that they were simply incomparable.

No wonder even the powerful Holy Lord of Shadows had to escape...

In the main hall, facing the direction of the door, there were 12 steps on the stairs towards a throne, with descending widths. There were six other chairs with inscriptions three steps beneath the throne, with three on each side.

The seven seats were empty. There wasn’t a single person in the huge palace, except for Ye Qingtang and the two people who had brought her there.

The winged person clearly said that a few Elders and Guardians had been waiting for some time. Why was there no one to be seen?

Ye Qingtang was puzzled.
