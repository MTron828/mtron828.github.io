Chapter 2354: Stealing Their Teacher (1)

Wu Fengling spoke with Ye Qing for a while longer before having the crowd disperse. There was still some time before the Inter-Academy Competition, so Wu Fengling hoped that Ye Qing could help Hang Wenwei and the rest improve for the competition.

After today, every time Hang Wenwei and his group gazed at Ye Qing, it was with eyes filled with adoration and worship. They were eager to see how Ye Qing would teach them.

But it was clear that someone else was even more eager than Hang Wenwei and his group.

The next morning, Lei Yan, Hang Wenwei and the others arrived at the agreed location very early to wait for Ye Qing to arrive.

Just as Ye Qing stepped into the room, and before Hang Wenwei and the others could exhibit their boot-licking skills, a figure dashed over.

“Teacher Ye.” Zhu Ning stood outside the door, looking humbly at Ye Qing.

“Teacher Zhu?” Ye Qingtang was surprised by Zhu Ning’s appearance.

“I obtained a recipe some time ago and studied it for a long time, but still cannot figure it out. There are a few ingredients listed which I feel have to be reconsidered, so I hope to invite Teacher Ye to analyze it with me.” Zhu Ning looked at Ye Qing without the slightest hint of arrogance. He was truly sincere about asking for Ye Qing’s guidance.

Ye Qingtang was dumbstruck.

Hang Wenwei and the others were likewise stupefied. They never expected Zhu Ning to appear like this.

Their faces started to twitch. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Was Teacher Zhu kidding them?

Teacher Ye didn’t belong to the medicine faculty. How dare he so boldly try to steal their teacher away like this? Was it really appropriate?

After personally witnessing Ye Qing’s elixir-refinement skills, Zhu Ning was utterly convinced of his abilities. Also, he heard another teacher say last night that Yun Chen’s elixir-refinement standard had greatly improved since several months ago. And it was all thanks to Ye Qing.

That teacher was the same one who had previously tried to convince Ye Qing to join the medicine faculty as a warden, but he had rejected him.

The teacher didn’t take the rejection to heart. In addition, he had been away from the academy the past few months and so didn’t get the chance to tell anyone of this matter. That was why things had escalated in this manner.

In the end, that teacher returned and found out that Ye Qing’s elixir-refinement level was even more formidable, he was stunned.

This further solidified Zhu Ning’s respect for Ye Qing.

As a result, he had come here first thing in the morning with his elixir recipe, to seek out Ye Qing.

“Teacher Zhu, I have some things to do…” Ye Qingtang was in a dilemma. If it was some other person, she could have just kicked him out. But Zhu Ning, as stubborn as he was, his adoration for alchemy was sincere. And his tone had been so humble.

There was a saying that one could not bear to slap a smiling face. Ye Qingtang felt rather embarrassed rejecting him.

Zhu Ning said, “Teacher Ye, don’t worry. I just need half a day of your time. More over… the pursuit of martial arts is endless and there’s not much time left for the Inter-Academy Competition. On the other hand, Teacher Ye’s alchemy skills are rare and valuable. I wonder if Teacher Ye is interested in joining the medicine faculty…”

In a matter of seconds, Zhu Ning made his offer.

Lei Yan and the others had been listening patiently but they suddenly realized what Zhu Ning was asking.

What the hell!

Zhu Ning wanted to steal their Boss over to the medicine faculty?!

What was going on in this world? First, it was Hang Wenwei and those punks, and now even Zhu Ning wanted a share?
