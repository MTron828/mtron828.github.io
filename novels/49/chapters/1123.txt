Chapter 1124 Demonic Creature 2

After witnessing this terrifying scene, even the little white tiger, a Fiendcelestial Beast, was shocked.

“This… is too scary…”

It was as though tens of thousands of citizens in Sky Stars City instantly became food for that demonic creature.

The entire city turned into a living hell as an intense smell of blood enshrouded the city.

The minced flesh mixed with blood continuously fell from the demonic creature’s mouth to its legs. A half-eaten corpse of a child fell into a pile of blood with a thud.

Only despair and fear from before he died could be seen on the child’s originally innocent and pure face.

As Ye Qingtang looked at the living hell before her eyes, her hands were clenched tightly into a fist, and there seemed to be a layer of fog in her eyes.

She looked up slightly and looked at that human-looking demonic creature, which was walking upright.

Even though there was a distance between her and that demonic creature, she could still clearly sense the dangerous aura around that demonic creature. Even with her Yang Lord skills… it was impossible for her to have any chance of victory…

Even if Ye Qingtang wished to save the people in Sky Stars City, she did not have the power to do so.

If she abruptly rushed into the city to save them, not only would she be unable to rescue anyone, she and the little white tiger would also lose their lives in the city.

Ye Qingtang shut her eyes and took a deep breath, forcefully suppressing her anger, but the despair and wails echoed around her ears.

“Holy Lady… what exactly is that thing… This aura is too stifling… I even have problems breathing now…” The Blood Moon Elder who fled out together felt that his breathing was a little hurried at this instant.

Ye Qingtang opened her eyes slowly and forced herself to calm down. She automatically recalled that those You Ancient Clan senior executives mentioned Elder Yin Fo earlier on.

“Could it be that… this demonic creature is the Elder Yin Fo that the You Ancient Clan people said…” Ye Qingtang frowned slightly.

The moment Ye Qingtang spoke, Blood Moon Elder’s expression changed instantly. He raised his hand and pointed to one black, giant eye in Sky Stars City.

“Holy Lady… this is bad! Look!” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

That giant eye moved slowly and landed straight on Ye Qingtang.

“Tsk… Tsk tsk…”At the same time, the human-looking demonic creature laughed sinisterly. “Found… you…”

Swoosh!

Energy rushed into the legs of the human-looking demonic creature, and its towering body jumped out of the city instantly with a terrifying smile on its face.

“F*ck you. Quickly run!”

The little white tiger looked at the human-looking demonic creature, which bolted towards them. It bared its fangs instantly, and its fur stood up. The extremely dangerous aura immediately caused the little white tiger to be in self-defense mode.

Without the little white tiger’s reminder, Ye Qingtang immediately fled away once she saw the demonic creature inching closer to them

“Miss Ye, head to the next city immediately.” Ling Yan’s voice rang from the voice transmission stone again at the critical moment.

“What…” Ye Qingtang frowned deeply. Currently, all the cities in the north were already conquered by the You Ancient Clan. She was now being chased after by a demonic creature… If she went there, wouldn’t she be attacked from the front and the back?
