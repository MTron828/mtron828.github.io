Chapter 1563 An Obvious Extortion 2

‘You’re not scared, but I’m scared!’Jiang Yu almost explained to Ye Qingtang that he cared about his prestige. However, after seeing how Ye Qingtang wanted to level up in order to bring honor to the family, the words choked in his throat.

To be honest...

It was undeniable that Ye Qingtang saved him. If not, he might still be trapped and waiting for death to come with the rest of the children in that forbidden place.

However, if Ye Qingtang used this incident to gain honor points, he had to personally vouch for her. It was his decision to bring Ye Qingtang into the Elder Cabinet. He needed to be fair when rewarding Ye Qingtang with honor points. He had to tell the rest of the elders to prove that he was not siding with Ye Qingtang.

However...

This meant that Jiang Yu had to tell others that he was trapped in the forbidden place...

He would never tell others about that.

Jiang Yu coughed and said, “Though you have nothing to be bothered with, I need to be considerate for you. Since you are determined to level up, I will definitely support your decision. Okay...”

Jiang Yu thought for a while and continued. “Don’t mention saving me. Just say that you found a treasure in the forbidden place of the Land of Infinite Demons. You handed that treasure over to me, which is equal to handing it over to the Jiang Family. You can get honor points from that as well.”

Jiang Yu felt that it would be shameless if he did not give Ye Qingtang the honor points. However, his prestige would be ruined if he did so publicly to reward her for saving him. He then made up a perfect excuse.

Ye Qingtang knew about Jiang Yu’s concern. She would not even mention this matter if she did not wish to improve significantly in half a year’s time. She totally agreed with Jiang Yu’s excuse.

“I really appreciate your concern for me, Domain Monarch Founder. I will work harder to cultivate after I get the honor points. I will not disappoint you.” Ye Qingtang understood when the right time to compromise was.

Jiang Yu sighed in relief. He waved his hand to signal Ye Qingtang to wait outside and called over the few elders of the inner sect. He needed to confirm the honor points for Ye Qingtang and also to check Ye Qingtang’s potential.

Ye Qingtang left the room, but You Qiong showed a cunning expression. Jiang Yu felt that he could slap him anytime now.

“Your descendant is really clever.” You Qiong smiled and said.

Jiang Yu frowned slightly but did not bother to reply to him.

Soon, the two inner sect elders arrived. One of them was Elder Qian, who came back with Ye Qingtang the other day. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Jiang Yu told them about how Ye Qingtang found a treasure in the Land of Infinite Demons and how she handed it over to him. The two elders believed everything he said, and both agreed to give Ye Qingtang honor points as a reward.

Jiang Yu understood that it was a big deal that Ye Qingtang saved him. She deserved a huge amount of honor points. Even though he made up an excuse, he did not want Ye Qingtang to lose out. He described how rare and significant the “treasure” was and decided to award Ye Qingtang with ten thousand honor points.

“I heard about Ye Qingtang from Elder Qian. She has the variant Heavenly Demon Bloodline. However, she missed the right time of cultivation as she was wandering outside with another family. Since she’s back now, we can observe her potential. If she’s very talented, there’s still a chance to catch up even though she wasted more than ten years.” Elder Kun nodded in agreement after hearing that Jiang Yu wanted to check Ye Qingtang’s potential.
