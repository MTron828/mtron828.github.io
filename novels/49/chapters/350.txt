If he really consumed the Bonded Soul Pill, he could return to his peak!

Instantly, the Blood Moon Sect Elder no longer looked at Ye Qingtang with despise like before, and his eyes were instead twinkling with expectation.

Just as the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s eyes were burning in excitement, Ye Qingtang poured cold water on him.

“I can refine the Bonded Soul Pill, but it requires the essence of the world, which is extremely difficult to obtain. I don’t have it now.”

The Blood Moon Sect Elder’s full heart of expectation vanished instantly, and all energy was lost.

Yet, on another thought, as long as Ye Qingtang knew the formula for the Bonded Soul Pill, he still had a chance of returning to his peak as long as he found a way to gather the materials.

“No hurry, no hurry… We can slowly search and gather for the materials in the future,” said the Blood Moon Sect Elder pleasingly.

Ye Qingtang watched the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s rare act of pleasing her, and a trace of laughter flashed across her eyes silently.

“That’s fine as well. If I don’t have anything on in the future, I can make some Source of the Marrow Pill for you to nourish yourself. The Bonded Soul Pill can wait awhile.”

The Blood Moon Sect Elder nodded repeatedly, though he scoffed internally.

He would go along with this girl right now, but once he obtained the Bonded Soul Pill in the future, he would definitely destroy this girl. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Ye Qingtang looked at the Blood Moon Sect Elder silently, and the smile in her heart deepened.

Although the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s skills decreased greatly, his experience and inside information of all aspects were way beyond those of ordinary people. Even though he was unable to be of help in her martial skills and cultivation, he would be a great help to her in other areas.

If the Blood Moon Sect Elder was not used properly, he would be a fatal sword, but if made use of well… he was a sharp blade that countered enemies.

She was obviously aware of the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s hatred towards her, but… since she dared to make use of him, she had a certain level of confidence.

“You must be careful in the inner sect from now on. Don’t stir up any trouble.” Ye Qingtang warned. She handed the Blood Moon Sect Elder the Source of the Marrow Pill because she was afraid he would start messing around in the inner sect.

The inner sect was not comparable to the outer sect. If any inner sect disciples disappeared, the sect elders might personally investigate the case.

“Rest assured, I will take note of it.” The Blood Moon Sect Elder was very easy to talk to this time. Anyway, with the Source of the Marrow Pill, it was no longer that important to absorb the disciples’ essence.

Furthermore, he was still anticipating the Bonded Soul Pill that Ye Qingtang would refine in the future, and obviously, he had to give her face now.

After warning the Blood Moon Sect Elder repeatedly, Ye Qingtang finally left his courtyard, and he actually walked her out himself in a rare good mood.

It was just that these two people had their own thoughts, and it was still unknown who would gain the upper hand in the future.

Ye Qingtang returned from the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s and had one less worry. However, she did not return to her residence immediately and walked in the opposite direction instead.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder’s side was considered to be settled, but Ye Qingtang’s most important issue was her own skills.

In another half a month, she could participate in sect missions, and the Xuanming points in her hands were already depleted. She would still have to take on missions at that time, and only then would she able to cultivate in the Spirit Consonance River more frequently to raise her skills in the shortest time possible.

At that thought, Ye Qingtang’s eyes fell on the Demonic Blood Sword on her waist.

An invincible sword capable of destroying anything was definitely a winning weapon in missions!
