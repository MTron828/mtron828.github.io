Some youngsters scoffed as they looked at the lady who was cornered.

“Why… Why must you all do this to me…” The lady’s face was full of despair and panic.

They were her senior brothers and sisters who stuck together through life and death in the past. Why would they corner her to this point just for a Heart of the Demon God?

“Ye Qingtang, hand the Heart of the Demon God over.”

A few elderlies rushed over very quickly.

“President…”

The lady was in disbelief as she looked at the Sacred Martial Academy’s President who was once friendly and compassionate. The current President was like a whole other person, no longer the President she knew.

Swoosh!

At that instant, numerous powerful figures from the royal family of the Central Dynasty stood in the air and towered over the lady.

One of them stared at the lady indifferently and scoffed. “Ye Qingtang, hand the Heart of the Demon God to me.”

“Yu Qingqiu…”

She was in utter disbelief as she looked at that female royal who looked down at her without any emotions. “Qingqiu… why… Have you forgotten? I was the one who supported you in stabilizing your position as the Princess! If I hand the heart to you… I will die!”

After hearing that, the female royal sneered scornfully. “You’re a useless thing who does not have a spirit root. With the Heart of the Demon God in you, it’s only a reckless waste of natural resources. I’m very thankful to you for helping me to ascend to the position as the Princess. Since that’s the case, you can help me to the end… Hand the Heart of the Demon God to me!”

Ye Qingtang suddenly narrowed her eyes as she watched the scene before her. A feeling of depression that had been repressed for a long time seeped out of her chest.

In her previous life, after arriving at the Central Mainland, she cultivated in the Sacred Martial Academy. That was where she got acquainted with a genius disciple in the academy, Yu Qingqiu.

Yu Qingqiu’s identity was actually the illegitimate daughter of the Emperor of the Central Royal Family.

Back then, Ye Qingtang supported Yu Qingqiu fully and ultimately helped her to ascend to the position as the Eldest Princess of the Central Dynasty.

Ye Qingtang treated Yu Qingqiu as her close friend, yet she never expected that she wanted to snatch her Heart of the Demon God today!

Clank!

A cold glint flickered in Ye Qingtang’s eyes. She drew her Demonic Blood Sword out immediately and slashed at Yu Qingqiu.

Swoosh!

The blood-colored sword slight disappeared after a second as though it slashed in the air. Yu Qingqiu’s body was not injured at all, and even more so, this attack did not attract the attention of anyone at all.

It was as if they did not sense anything. The savage and arrogant laughter on their face remained.

Ye Qingtang was slightly shaken when her sword slashed in the air. The murderous intent in her eyes subsequently faded as she chuckled.

“This place is indeed… my reverse mental demons… All of this is merely my obsession…” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The scene before her was a memory in the deepest corner of her mind that she could not bear to recall. The current her was only an onlooker and nothing more…

“Yu Qingqiu… I can understand… if people want to snatch my Heart of the Demon God. But, why do Sacred Martial Academy… and you want to kill me as well? Does benefit override everything in this world…” The lady was filled with despair, with grief and resentment clearly seen on her face.

“Ye Qingtang, cut the crap. Hand the Heart of the Demon God over. We will not take your life!”

“Hmph! What has your life or death got to do with us? We only want the Heart of the Demon God. As for your life or death, it will be left to the Heavens to decide!”

Everyone from Sacred Martial Academy had a cold attitude. To them, the Heart of the Demon God was what they truly wanted. As for Ye Qingtang, she was merely a sacrifice in their struggle for the Heart of the Demon God.
