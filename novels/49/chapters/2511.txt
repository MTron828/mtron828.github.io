Chapter 2512: Return (1)

Ye Qingtang finally heaved a sigh of relief when she saw the man enter the void and leave.

It had to be said that that man was indeed terrifyingly powerful. A single punch could shatter the void. It was not a good thing at all to be targeted by someone like that.

Of course, Ye Qingtang knew that the man was not interested in her but more interested in the Divine Concealment Spell she used. But no matter what, this was not something for Ye Qingtang to shout for joy over.

“Holy Lady, has that monster gone far enough?” The Blood Moon Elder only dared to speak after a long time.

“Wait a while longer,” Ye Qingtang said softly.

To be safe, it was best not to reveal themselves at this moment. If they came back with a surprise attack, it would be disastrous.

Ye Qingtang did not stay there either. After bringing the Blood Moon Elder and the big yellow dog far away, she only released the spell after most of her Deity Ocean was depleted.

“We are safe now,” Ye Qingtang murmured.

By now, the Wailing Well had fallen into a dead silence. There were no more above-Emperor level monsters or other life forms. Only Ye Qingtang, the Blood Moon Elder and a dog were left in the huge Wailing Well.

“Holy Lady, what should we do now? We can’t stay here forever, right?” The Blood Moon Elder looked to Ye Qingtang for complete guidance and support.

Ye Qingtang fell into deep thought.

The previous exit had already been closed, but with the departure of those elders, logically speaking, the seal on the exit should have been completely removed. If the seal was not removed, they could only leave through the void hole made by that man earlier.

However, Ye Qingtang did not want to do that. Firstly, they did not know where that void hole led to and it would be very easy to bump into that man.

Ye Qingtang did not have much Deity Ocean power left. It would be difficult for her to escape again.

After another hour or so, Ye Qingtang brought the Blood Moon Elder and the yellow dog towards the Ice Ocean. That was the only exit.

“Holy Lady, the seal on the exit seems to have been lifted!”

The Blood Moon Elder pointed ahead and was overjoyed.

“Hahaha! I never expected that I would see the light of day again… This is great! I’m going out to take revenge. I’ll let those bastards know that they can’t bully a dog just like that!” The yellow dog bared its teeth eagerly.

Ye Qingtang looked at the big yellow dog strangely. This dog actually had enemies. However, no one knew how long the big yellow dog had been asleep. Perhaps its enemies had already died of old age…? T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

If so, who was it going to seek revenge on?

“Holy Lady, let’s leave this ominous land quickly!” The Blood Moon Elder urged impatiently when he saw that Ye Qingtang was not moving.

“Let’s go.” Ye Qingtang nodded slightly. She did not want to stay in the Wailing Well any longer either.

Actually, it was not that she did not gain anything from this trip to the Wailing Well. At the very least, if she had not come here, the Blood Moon Elder would not have revived so easily.

Of course, apart from that, Ye Qingtang also picked up something bad. She was now being targeted by a powerful monster for no reason. This was truly bad karma.

Taking in a deep breath, Ye Qingtang calmed herself down before walking towards the exit. Closely behind her, the yellow dog and the Blood Moon Elder followed Ye Qingtang in hurried steps..
