“Well then, let’s begin the lesson now.” Ye Qingtang grinned at Jing Ze, who was standing alone in front of her.

Jing Ze gave a small start before nodding his head. He obediently sat down and looked at Ye Qingtang with a compliant expression.

Looking at this good boy and recalling that notorious evil man from 300 years into the future, Ye Qingtang couldn’t help feeling somewhat incredulous...

“Are you at the Paragon Sixth Heaven level?” Ye Qingtang asked Jing Ze.

Jing Ze nodded timidly.

“What is your bloodline?” Ye Qingtang asked.

In the Second Domain, spirit roots were already completely ineffective. The true crux was bloodline. The higher quality one’s bloodline was, the higher one’s chance was of becoming very powerful. In academies like the Netherworld Academy, nearly everyone came from a powerful bloodline.

“I... I don’t have a bloodline.” Jing Ze lowered his head and mumbled.

Ye Qingtang was taken aback.

“You don’t have a bloodline?”

“Yes.” Jing Ze’s voice became even softer.

“It doesn’t matter. Countless strong practitioners in this world still managed to achieve high status even without a bloodline.” Ye Qingtang tried to console him. She really couldn’t bear to say anything that would upset this obedient teenager.

Jing Ze raised his head in amazement. He looked at the youth who was even shorter than himself.

“Teacher Ye, you... you are truly a good person.”

Ye Qingtang: “...”

What did she do to suddenly become a good person?

“I just managed to scrape past the entry requirements when I first enrolled in the Netherworld Academy. I was already a Paragon Sixth Heaven level then but failed to make any progress even after so many years here. All the teachers think that I am useless. Firstly, it’s because I have no bloodline. Secondly, it looks like my cultivation level is already stagnant. Before today... a teacher told me that if I don’t improve my cultivation level soon, I will be kicked out of the Netherworld Academy...” Jing Ze clasped his hands together as he lowered his head and spoke in a small voice.

After all, he was not a disciple from any notable family and didn’t have the support of some great clan. He was just from a normal family and had worked hard for every single one of his own achievements. But... after coming to the Netherworld Academy, the stagnation of his skills had him dropping into a deep abyss. He was ridiculed by everyone and his already introverted character turned even more timid.

Ye Qingtang couldn’t help sighing at Jing Ze’s words. She recalled how her former self lost her spirit root and ended up in a similar situation.

It was common for the cultivation levels of some to stop after reaching a certain stage. Some practitioners would forever remain at a certain level without any progress.

“Don’t worry. I will not let you get kicked out of the academy.” Ye Qingtang looked at Jing Ze.

Jing Ze lifted his head and gazed at Ye Qingtang with sparkling eyes. It was like he had seen his final chance at life.

All the teachers had already given up on him. He himself had been resigned to his fate...

“What martial arts did you practice before? Tell me about them all.” Ye Qingtang spoke seriously.

Logically, Jing Ze was still young and his cultivation level should not be fixed so soon. Ye Qingtang believed that there must be a problem somewhere.

So Jing Ze obediently told Ye Qingtang about all the martial arts that he had practiced before.

As Ye Qingtang listened, she couldn’t detect anything wrong. She then had Jing Ze circulate his energy as she tried to analyze his internal energy.

Ye Qingtang discovered something strange during her analysis. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

She could clearly feel that Jing Ze possessed a huge amount of spirit energy inside him. But it seemed like the spirit energy was being restrained by something.

It was as if...
