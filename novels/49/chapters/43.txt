Chapter 44: Gossip and Rumors (3)

Ye Qingtang had already saved two lives from the Si household. If Mu Su declined the meeting invitation, Old Master Si would have a hard time making it up to her. Thus, it was fortunate everything went smoothly.

“Master Si, many thanks for your kind assistance.” Ye Qingtang was truly grateful for his help. Without the Si household’s referral, it would be impossible for her to get in touch with dignitaries such as Mu Su.

As long as she could meet him, her plans could finally come to fruition!

“There’s no need for thanks.” Old Master Si smiled as he added, “Qingtang, you’re no stranger to us, just call me grandpa like the rest of them young’uns if you wish.”

Ye Qingtang’s eyes lit up and without standing on ceremony, she said, “Roger, Grandpa Si.”

Old Master Si gave a chortle before he continued:

“Qingtang, this old grandpa will nag a bit. Since you’ll be meeting his Lordship, make sure you’re sincere in your intentions. His Lordship’s a large-hearted personage but condemns contrivances, you’d do well to remember that.”

“Roger.” Ye Qingtang knew Old Master Si was giving his advice out of good will.

Old Master Si held Ye Qingtang in high regard even though she was part of the Ye household that he despised. But one could not deny, the longer he had gotten to know her, the more his fondness towards this sweet and smart girl grew. She had nothing of the sort of brashness and ignorance that ought to be evident in a girl her age.

Old Master Si intended for her to stay for a meal, but Ye Qingtang declined politely.

Since she had heard an answer from Mu Su, it was time for her next move. She estimated the arrival of that ‘thing’, which was bound to be born. If she was late, she might miss that again, like during her past.

“Grandpa Si, I’m sorry I can’t stay for long. There’s still some matters I’ve to attend to.”

“No worries. I won’t keep you then.”

After bidding her valediction to Old Master Si, Ye Qingtang left the Si’s residence.

She hummed a tune while on her way to the Withered Woods.

Her visit to the Withered Woods now was not for a stroll, but to acquire a certain treasure she missed out in her past!

While treading along the fallen leaves, Ye Qingtang maneuvered effortlessly through the woods. Behind the Withered Woods was a mountain range which drew the horizon between the earth and sky.

There was a thunderstorm a few days ago, which caused a landslide in the encompassing valley, damaging quite a portion of the woods. The aftermath was a mess, with the surrounding fallen leaves cluttered with gravel and debris.

Ye Qingtang lifted the hem of her skirt as she strode towards the valley, stopping in front of a cavern which was partially caved-in.

In her past, Ye Ling and the Second Elder were assassinated upon the Great Elder’s return. Ye Qingtang faced the same crisis, that forced her to escape into the Withered Woods.

She fell upon this stone cavern while escaping amidst the darkness of the night, hiding within it for days, enduring her suffering and hunger. It was not until she was certain of the assassins’ departure, did she finally come out of the cave.

And it was also during that moment, when she caught a glimpse of that certain ‘thing’, but she was too weak and distracted with keeping herself alive to pay any attention to that, without knowing she had missed out on a treasure which could turn her life around.

No way would she miss that again this time! T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

A smirk came across her lips as she rummaged through piles of rubble, with her fair and delicate hands.

Moments later, a dirt and grime covered “egg”, the size of her palm, was unearthed before her very eyes.
