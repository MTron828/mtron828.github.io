Chapter 1858: Hoodwinked (1)

The fat catfishes’ physiques were dependent on the amount of things they kept in their stomach. This naturally led to Ye Qingtang picking the fattest catfish since she was determined to gather enough spirit stones to seek protection at the Crystal Palace.

Ye Qingtang instantly took Little White Tiger and the two spirit stones with her, squeezing through the crowd of rotund bodies to reach the fattest catfish.

The group of fat catfishes wasn’t bothered by them, they were too absorbed in the bet. The fattest catfish seemed to have won this round. It grabbed a bunch of spirit stones, shoving them into its stomach.

“Let’s have a bet?” Ye Qingtang smiled at the fat catfish.

The fat catfish froze for a moment, sizing Ye Qingtang up with its beady eyes.

“Sure.”

Fat catfishes had never and would never reject gambling invitations.

“Lass, what are the stakes?” The fat catfish narrowed its eyes, looking at Ye Qingtang as though she was a fat sheep ready to be butchered.

“Enough spirit stones to enter the Crystal Palace.” Ye Qingtang had no idea how many spirit stones it would take to enter the Crystal Palace so she just said that.

Once Ye Qingtang said that, the fat catfish was taken aback.

“Fine, but what are your stakes?”

Ye Qingtang took out the two precious spirit stones.

“...” The fat catfish was at a loss for words.

“Are you kidding?” The fat catfish stared at her with widened eyes, feeling ridiculed.

“The Crystal Palace costs at least 500 spirit stones a day. You’re thinking of only using two spirit stones to make a bet with me? Are you taking me for a fool?”

Ye Qingtang was dumbfounded.

500 spirit stones?

The other fat catfishes turned their attention to them once they overheard the conversation, looking at Ye Qingtang as though she was an ignorant fool.

“Two spirit stones, who would even make a bet with such low stakes...”

“No one would make a bet with stakes below 20 spirit stones.”

“It’s not even enough for me to have a meal.”

The group of fat catfishes was grumbling at the scant spirit stone.

The corners of Ye Qingtang’s mouth twitched as she looked at the two ‘precious’ spirit stones in her palm, realizing that...

She had been cheated by that crafty fat catfish!

It was f*cking precious?!

According to these fat catfishes, it would take at least ten spirit stones to get a meal here. The five spirit stones that the crafty fat catfish lost to her wasn’t even enough for a meal!

She was wary of everything, but let her guard down around that fat catfish!

Though Ye Qingtang was devastated inside, she still remained calm and collected on the outside. An idea suddenly popped up in her mind.

“You’re mistaken, I’m not using these two spirit stones,” Ye Qingtang said.

The fat catfish looked at her with confusion. “What are you using then?”

Ye Qingtang pulled her sleeve up, revealing her slim wrist.

Her eyes were fixed on the fat catfish’s face.

The fat catfish’s eyes instantly lit up when it saw Ye Qingtang’s wrist.

“You’re using this bangle?”

There was excitement in its voice.

Ye Qingtang could confirm that the fat catfishes could see the Nine Souls Ring on her wrist.

“Yes, that’s right.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

“Deal.” The fat catfish instantly agreed with a completely different attitude from before.

“I’ll bet 500 spirit stones!” This time, the fat catfish was nearly desperate as it announced.
