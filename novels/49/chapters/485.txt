“Ning Luo, you must be buried here today. I’m afraid it’s delusional of you to wish to return back to Yunxiao Sect alive.” Ye Qingtang’s eyes were ice-cold as though they were completely devoid of emotion.

The Demonic Blood Sword drew a blood fog in the air.

Then, Ye Qingtang charged towards Ning Luo with the Demonic Blood Sword in hand.

“Junior Sister Ye, don’t be rash!”

Suddenly, Qin Huan and the rest rushed up to stop Ye Qingtang.

“What are you all doing?” Ye Qingtang frowned.

“Junior Sister Ye, the Sect Master’s order is to bring this betrayer back to the sect for interrogation. If you kill him, it seems a little inappropriate.” Qin Huan explained after thinking for a moment.

“Bringing a corpse back is the same as well,” Ye Qingtang said.

“How is that the same? A corpse can’t talk…” Qin Huan was speaking halfway but met Ye Qingtang’s cold glare.

“If I don’t kill him, how about I kill you instead?” Ye Qingtang said.

Then, Qin Huan could not help but shudder as he sensibly retreated to a side with Zhu Changge and the rest.

“Junior Sister Ye, you’re right. Eliminate the evil for the sect! Kill the betrayer, Ning Luo!” Qin Huan pointed at Ning Luo and shouted seriously. “Kill him!”

“Yes… kill him…” Zhu Changge nodded as well.

“Kill… kill him…” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The other inner sect disciples were very sensible as well.

Ye Qingtang immediately flicked her wrist, and the Demonic Blood Sword was slashed toward Ning Luo at the speed of lightning.

As long as Ning Luo died, Xuanling Sect could be saved.

However…

At this critical instant, a silver arrow flew towards Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang’s brows were tightly furrowed. The track of her Demonic Blood Sword diverted a little and was blocked in front of her body.

Boom!

That silver arrow shot on the Demonic Blood Sword, sparking a flare.

“Humph!”

A loud scoff erupted at the scene.

In the next second, Elder Lin and his grandson, Lin Feng, walked toward them slowly.

“Elder Lin?!”

Qin Huan and the rest were taken aback by Elder Lin’s appearance.

“Master!” Zhu Changge hurriedly bowed.

Elder Lin waved a hand for Zhu Changge to rise before turning to give Lin Feng a look.

Nodding, Lin Feng walked toward Ning Luo in great strides and helped him up with a concerned expression. “Senior Brother Ning Luo, are you alright?”

Ning Luo’s lips curled up as he looked at Lin Feng. “It’s fine.”

“Elder Lin, what is the meaning of this? Why did you attack Junior Sister Ye?” Qin Huan looked at Elder Lin in confusion.

Not mentioning Qin Huan, other inner sect disciples and even Zhu Changge could not understand Elder Lin’s intention.

“Ye Qingtang, how bold of you! How dare you want to kill my disciple!” Elder Lin bellowed at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang scoffed coldly at Elder Lin’s words. “How do I explain this? Ning Luo is a spy in the sect. If I don’t kill him, do I not do anything and let him kill me?”

“Fallacious argument!” Elder Lin waved his sleeve and interrupted Ye Qingtang. “The sect will judge whether Ning Luo is the sect spy, and it’s not yet your turn to execute the sect rights. You have committed a serious offense, yet you still don’t know that you’re in the wrong?!”

Without giving Ye Qingtang a chance to speak, Elder Lin looked at the Xuanling Sect disciples and ordered. “This girl is audacious. Capture her!”

“This…”

The other Xuanling Sect disciples looked at each other.
