Chapter 1010 Reform (4)

Although there were some misunderstandings between the Si Family and the Ye Family in the past, the relationship between both family clans had been very amiable ever since Ye Qingtang treated Si Bai successfully.

“Old Si, if there’s anything you want to say, why don’t you just shoot it out?” Ye Ling asked with a smile.

Clan Master Si nodded and said, “Alright… I’ll say it straight then… I wish to combine the Si Family into the Ye Family. It’s pretty much sharing the spotlight of my Tang Tang.”

Because of the Long Family, the Si Family had been on a gradual decline. However, if it could join the Ye Family, the situation would be completely different. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“This…”

After hearing what Clan Master Si said, the few elders and Ye Ling were a little surprised. This Old Si actually intended to combine the Si Family into the Ye Family?

Of course, it was not easy for them to make a decision for such matters. After all, Clan Master Si proposed this for the sake of Ye Qingtang

“Tang Tang, what do you think?”

Second Elder looked at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang pondered for a moment and subsequently shook her head. “No.”

Clan Master Si and Si Ye were taken aback by her reply.

The two of them initially thought that given their relations with Ye Qingtang, there should not be any problem even if they were to enter the Ye Family.

Ye Qingtang was currently an unrivaled Yang Lord, and if the Si Family was combined into the Ye Family, it would still be the best outcome even if the Si Family would cease to exist from then on.

An awkward smile emerged on Clan Master Si’s face. He never thought that Ye Qingtang would reject so firmly.

“Grandfather Si, you want to combine the Si Family into the Ye Family merely because of my influence as a Yang Lord. Although I am a member of the Ye Family, I am also considered half a Si. Since that’s the case, doesn’t it mean that the Si Family also has a Yang Lord and Grandfather Si has a Yang Lord granddaughter? Why is there a need to inconvenience yourself by combining the Si Family into the Ye Family?” Ye Qingtang looked at the rather dejected Clan Master Si and smiled.

Clan Master Si was surprised to hear Ye Qingtang’s response.

As a Yang Lord, Ye Qingtang actually said she was his granddaughter… half a Si…

Back when Ye Qingtang was younger, Grandfather Si treated her very well, and she had never forgotten about it. The fact that she could even enter Xuanling Sect was also because of Grandfather Si. Apart from this, there were countless other things Grandfather Si did for her, which showed that he treated her like his own granddaughter wholeheartedly.

How could Ye Qingtang treat the Si Family badly now?

Immediately, Ye Qingtang stood up and raise her right arm slightly, injecting her Divine Sense into Si Ye’s glabella.

“This is…” Si Ye trembled at the appearance of an inexplicably huge amount of energy.

“Big Brother Si Ye, this is my Divine Sense which contains my will. With this energy, you should be able to recruit many powerful figures for the Si Family.” Ye Qingtang replied with a smile.

“I see…” Si Ye understood the meaning in Ye Qingtang’s words instantly.

If the Si Family said that they had a Yang Lord in their clan, no one in this world would believe them. However, if they could display Ye Qingtang’s will, things would be completely different. There would definitely not be any hoax if a Yang Lord’s mental energy appeared personally. It was said that many hidden clans in the past also used this method to recruit powerful figures.

“Hahaha, isn’t this great then? Your Si Family also has centuries of history. If it is really combined into the Ye Family, Old Si would be the most unable to bear it.” The Second Elder looked at Clan Master Si and laughed.

It was, however, that Ye Qingtang’s actions were rather unexpected.
