“What do I need to do?” Ye Qingtang asked. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Wu Fengling replied, “In the past competitions, the lead teacher just needed to keep watch on the competition arena surroundings, just in case. But there seem to be some changes this year. You will only know of the details when you arrive.”

Ye Qingtang nodded. She did not find anything strange about this. Anyway, she would definitely be guiding her own brats. She would feel uneasy if someone else performed the task.

Besides, Wu Fengling must have taken all things into consideration before deciding to give such an important task to Ye Qing.

Ye Qing had a pretty high cultivation level and was highly skilled in alchemy. It was no surprise that he was the most suitable candidate.

Since Wu Fengling assigned Ye Qing to guide Lei Yan and the others as they already knew each other well. It was the best choice.

After Wu Fengling gave his instructions, he let Ye Qing go back first.

As Ye Qingtang returned, she thought of the Evil Soul Forest. With her current cultivation stage, it would take at most a day to travel to and fro the Evil Soul Forest. But Ye Qingtang also heard that there has been an increasing number of factions entering the forest. Many factions from the Second Domain were making their move.

She heard that during this period of time, a few of the factions had obtained quite a number of treasures from the fiendcelestial’s tomb.

The news was rather strange.

Ye Qingtang was well aware of how dangerous the fiendcelestial’s tomb was. Just that giant snake guarding the treasure trove was enough to kill off all the factions.

Even if someone was lucky enough to carry off one or two treasures from the tomb, it was a very low probability. But according to the news, the number of instances of treasures being brought out had far surpassed the reasonably expected amount.

Ye Qingtang felt that something was not quite right. But as she had yet to go and investigate, she was not sure what was going on.

Several days passed in the blink of an eye. The Netherworld Academy team that was to participate in the Inter-Academy Competition set off.

Wu Fengling remained in the Netherworld Academy to hold down the fort and the team was led by Vice-President Wen Qi.

Having trained so hard for so long, the teenagers finally embarked on their journey…

…

The Heaven Mainland was located in the ocean of the Second Domain. It was a wide expanse of land and the most vibrant martial arts place in the Second Domain.

On a regular basis, the elite academies from the various mainlands would lead their top students to this mainland to compete in the Inter-Academy Competition, which was held in Universe City on Heaven Mainland.

It was rumored that many years ago, the mainland’s biggest temple used to be located where Universe City was now. The temple worshipped a powerful god, but after the god disappeared, the temple was destroyed in the battle and completely flattened. Many years later, people started to build a new city on that piece of land.

This city was usually sealed off and no one was allowed to enter or leave. It was only opened during the Inter-Academy Competition. Like this, the originally empty city would become exceptionally lively during this period.

After arriving at Universe City, Lei Yan observed his surroundings with curiosity as his eyes surveyed the bustling shops lining the streets.

“I thought apart from those who are here for the competition, there would be no one else… I didn’t expect it to be so vibrant and filled with so many shops.”

Nangong Lie had clearly done his research. “Of course. The students sent here by the various academies are all the cream of the crop amongst the elite. Most of them are from wealthy family clans who had invested much effort to groom them, all with vast resources at their fingertips.. As long as there are rich people around, you don’t need to worry about there being nothing to buy.”
