Chapter 1306: Giving Advice (2)

Ye Qingtang inwardly rolled her eyes when she saw the dossiers piled up in front of her.

She was forced to do her best to kill Ling Yan.

However…

Lady Ghost and Ming Gu were standing behind her. Even if Ye Qingtang wanted to wash her hands of this matter, it would be impossible.

Helpless, Ye Qingtang had no choice but to read through the dossiers and gain a vague understanding of the powers around Ling Yan.

From the information in these dossiers, she gathered that Ling Yan was truly intelligent. Not only was he above reproach, but even his trusted followers were exacting and meticulous in their work.

“Disaster relief…” Ye Qingtang saw a record in the dossiers that two years ago, one of the borders in the Eternal Dynasty had been stricken by a natural disaster. Ling Yan was ordered to bring money and resources to the area to conduct disaster relief.

With that, Ye Qingtang immediately looked up and glanced at the Eldest Prince and the others. “Immediately send men there tonight.”

“What for?” Second Princess asked with a slight frown.

The place that Ye Qingtang was pointing to was a city on the borders of the Eternal Dynasty, miles away from the capital.

“Two years ago, there was a natural disaster there. Our Royal Father ordered Third Royal Brother to go there to relieve the people in the stricken areas, but… he’s always conscientious and doesn’t make any mistakes. Elder Ye, what is your intention?” The Eldest Prince vaguely guessed at Ye Qingtang’s intention but felt that something was amiss.

“Who knows whether he was conscientious or not?” Ye Qingtang raised her brows slightly.

The Eldest Prince was slightly taken aback. “Does Elder Ye mean that we should send men to find some people to incriminate Ling Yan?”

Ye Qingtang nodded slightly. Then, she raised her hand and pointed out a few places on the map of the Eternal Dynasty.

These places were all far-flung, but all of them had some connection to Ling Yan.

“Send men to all these places too. As long as you can get some people to change their testimony, nothing is impossible,” Ye Qingtang said as she looked at them.

With the Eldest Prince and the Second Princess’s influence, it would be an easy matter to buy off some citizens. It would be even easier to get some officials in these cities to alter their testimony.

All these were Ling Yan’s past achievements. If properly used, they could also be the source of his defeat.

When Ye Qingtang finished speaking, she did not hesitate and pointed out a few names in the dossiers.

“Get some men to look for these people.”

The Eldest Prince looked and saw that the people Ye Qingtang had pointed out were all trusted and long-time followers of Ling Yan. Also, they were all upright and respectable people.

“Elder Ye, what is your intention?”

Was Elder Ye planning to bring these unyielding persons over to their side? Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“We have interacted with these people before and tried to get them to betray Ling Yan, but they were unwilling, and their characters…”

Ye Qingtang was not interested in the Eldest Prince’s meandering discourse. She simply waved her hand and interrupted him.

“I told you to look for them, not to solicit them. I want them to hit the men you send.”

“What?” The Eldest Prince felt completely out of his depth.

Ye Qingtang looked at the puzzled expressions of the Eldest Prince, and the others and felt that… Ling Yan was right to disdain their intelligence.

The Eldest Prince was not stupid but rather intelligent. It was just that… his intelligence paled before Ling Yan.

But Lady Ghost understood Ye Qingtang’s meaning. She said with a smile, “Eldest Prince, you misunderstand Elder Ye’s intentions. As you say, the men chosen by Elder Ye are all men of integrity. But men like that are especially easy to trap.”
