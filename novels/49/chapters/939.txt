Chapter 940 Devouring Bloodline (3)

A piercing sound filled the space. This area seemed to lie prostrate and tremble under the sword. The scarlet sword gleam filled the air, destroying everything in its path and cutting a wide swath.

However, just as Ye Qingtang drew the Regicide Sky Blade, the girl vanished completely. It was as if she had melted into the air, and she was nowhere to be found.

Boom, boom, boom!!

The next moment, a thunderous crash rang out. The scarlet sword gleam had smashed a mountain peak a thousand meters away, pulverizing it. The gravel fell to the ground like rain.

“You’re pretty powerful.”

The girl suddenly tore through space, and she walked out from an unknown space.

“Space-transfer?!”

Ye Qingtang was stunned when she saw the girl tear space and walk out from it.

This girl’s skills were truly frightening…

Even an Emperor-level cultivator could not compare with this girl’s understanding and ability to manipulate space!

If not for the fact that they were currently in this mainland were spirit energy was scarce, who knew how terrifying her real ability would be?

However, before Ye Qingtang could recover her senses, the girl’s right palm lightly touched Ye Qingtang’s left shoulder.

She said coldly, “Actually, the Divine Phoenix got some things wrong. The Divine Phoenix ascertained that my spirit root was blue. However, I have no spirit root. The blue spirit root was merely an illusion that I created. I could have even created a purple spirit root.”

The instant the girl in green finished speaking, a purple spirit root exploded within her body. The terrifying power of her spirit root seemed to rend both heaven and earth. All things prostrated themselves and trembled.

This girl… can actually create an illusion of a spirit root?!

Ye Qingtang was shocked. In her previous life, Ye Qingtang had been robbed of her spirit root, so her body had no spirit root.

She had sought ways to create an illusion of a spirit root, but all these methods could at most create an illusion of the lowest level red spirit root.

But this girl in green could even create an illusion of a purple spirit root!

In addition, based on what Ye Qingtang knew about the ability to create an illusion of a spirit root, one could only create an illusion of its form. There was no way to create an illusion of the true power of a spirit root.

But this girl was different!

With such shocking skills, a hundred, a thousand, or even ten thousand Ye You’s was no match for her.

“That’s not right. In this world, only a reincarnated true god can create an illusion of a spirit root…” Ye Qingtang suddenly realized that something was amiss, and she frowned as she spoke.

“Oh… you do have some knowledge. Have you found me out?” The girl in green’s lips curved upwards slightly, and she suddenly smiled mysteriously.

“You are a reincarnation of a true god…” Ye Qingtang stared at the girl in green.

The so-called reincarnation of a true god occurred when a true god died and was reborn as a human. Only when its god-like powers were awakened could it be called a reincarnation of a true god.

And only a reincarnation of a true god could easily create the illusion of any spirit root!

The girl in green did not respond to Ye Qingtang. She only said coldly, “I am pleased to accept the bloodline of the original Divine Phoenix.”

As the girl spoke, Ye Qingtang felt the bloodline within her body boiling. It was as if even her soul was being sucked out of her body. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Not bad. The bloodline of the original Divine Phoenix is truly powerful. I am satisfied,” the girl in green said coldly.

“Ling Yan, what do you mean by allowing this person to devour the power of my bloodline…” Ye Qingtang frowned deeply. Ling Yan’s words reverberated in her mind.
