Chapter 280: My Junior Sister Is Amazing (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang and the emotionless “Zhou Qu” walked into the square together.

Not just Qin Huan but other Xuanling Sect disciples were all dumbfounded.

What was this situation?

How did the two of them actually return?

The two people that were originally thought to be definitely dead walked into everyone’s line of sight.

Qin Huan returned to his senses and spoke hurriedly. “Junior Sister Ye, leave now! That bastard elder might return again!”

Qin Huan’s face was full of worry.

However, Ye Qingtang could not help but laugh at his words. She secretly peered at the “bastard elder” beside her from the corner of her eyes and saw that the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s expression was completely dark.

If not for Ye Qingtang’s warning to not touch these people, he would have already dug Qin Huan’s heart out and bit it into pieces.

Who is a bastard!

Your entire family is filled with bastards!

Ye Qingtang held her laughter back and walked to the metal cage with a serious expression. Hacking the cage door with her sword, she said, “The Blood Moon Sect Elder left already. Don’t worry, senior brothers. I think he will not be back for a while.”

Everyone was stunned.

“Left… Left already?” Qin Huan repeated, dumbfounded.

“Mhm. I don’t know why either, but he suddenly left.” Ye Qingtang was lazy to come up with a reason. Anyway, the Blood Moon Sect was extremely mysterious to everyone, and it never left any trace in their movements. Thus, she could get away with a random excuse.

The frightened Xuanling Sect disciples fell into a trance as they looked at the opened cage.

Why did it leave just like that?

After releasing all her senior brothers, Ye Qingtang headed to another cage. The other cages in the square were long empty, and the ground was piled with corpses. Only in that cage sat a young boy whose eyes were swollen from crying.

He sat there absentmindedly and seemed to have no more tears left to cry. His hollow eyes looked at the dead body of his senior brother which laid in his hands, and he did not sense any movement in his surrounding.

When Ye Qingtang saw that young teen from Wind Moon Sect, she could not help but lament internally. She walked forward and slashed the cage.

“Your senior brother protected you with his life not because he wants to see you being defeated like this,” Ye Qingtang said and stood beside the youth.

The young teen suddenly lifted his head up, and his teary eyes looked at Ye Qingtang in confusion. He knew that the Blood Moon Sect Elder targeted him just now, but it was because of this girl’s sudden appearance which attracted the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s appearance, thus allowing him to escape a calamity.

“Senior… Senior brother…” The boy just said something, but tears fell uncontrollably. Tears stained his small face, and this really made one feel sorry. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Ye Qingtang handed the sword in her hand to the young teen. “Live on well. You can only avenge your senior brother by making yourself even more powerful.”

The Blood Moon Sect Elder who was standing aside felt the corners of his lips twitch.

The boy looked at the sword that he lost and then looked down at his senior brother’s corpse. He sniffed, wiped away his tears, and stretched a hand out to grab the sword. “I will. I must avenge senior brother! I will personally chop off that old demon’s head!”

The old demon: “…”

In just a short while, the Blood Moon Sect Elder became both a bastard and an old demon, and this was probably way more than the number of curses he heard in thousands of years.

Everyone escaped from the cage and regained freedom, but no one was able to relax in this bloody scene.
