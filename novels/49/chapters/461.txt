“Oh… Worldly Self-Illusion. Your martial talents are indeed shocking, and you have proved yourself to be the favorite disciple of Falling Sky Valley’s Perfected Xuanchen… Your Worldly Self-Illusion is actually at such a refined level…” Yue Tiancheng shook his head and continued. “If not for Master’s Kingdom of God Talisman, perhaps I would really have been defeated by you today.”

Then, Yue Tiancheng sneered as he took out another talisman from his space ring.

Once the talisman was completely burnt, it was as though there were singings of various gods in the surroundings, and an illusory Kingdom of God fell from the sky.

Shock filled Ji Yixuan’s eyes upon noticing the situation.

The Kingdom of God was the highest-level array formation which could even suppress someone at Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three! Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Yunxiao Sect was actually so generous to give their disciples such a life-saving item!

Seeing that the Kingdom of God was falling down, Ji Yixuan immediately retreated far away.

“Hah… it’s no use.” Yue Tiancheng’s lips curled into a cold scoff.

Just as Yue Tiancheng finished his sentence, the Kingdom of God landed and quelled Ji Yixuan’s duplicate while trapping his original self within it.

Subsequently, the Kingdom of God shrank and turned into an enclosed golden screen.

“A mere Kingdom of God and you wish to trap Ji Yixuan?!”

Ji Yixuan drew out his divine weapon with a loud clang.

At that moment, Ji Yixuan gripped on the divine weapon tightly with firmness in his eyes.

“Sword intent…”

Yue Tiancheng’s brows were tightly furrowed.

When cultivated to the extreme, a swordsman could develop the sword intent, which was incredibly frightening willpower that could even split mountains and cut rivers!

“Shatter!”

Ji Yixuan shouted sternly as he waved his divine weapon.

Boom!

A sword glint rummaged across the screen as though it wanted to annihilate this world!

However…

This frightening strike only caused a tiny crack on the exterior of the screen while the divine weapon in Ji Yixuan’s hands broke.

“Hahaha…” Yue Tiancheng guffawed at the situation. “Amazing… Indeed amazing… Truly a genius of Falling Sky Valley! It is a pity, though, that this Kingdom of God is given by my Master and is extremely firm. Even if you understand the sword intent, you can’t break it.”

Ji Yixuan did not move after hearing it as he looked at Yue Tiancheng without emotions. “It’s a pity. This Kingdom of God can trap people for only that long, and afterward, the force of the array formation would fade away. I will kill you once I’m out.”

“Out?” Yue Tiancheng shook his head. “I forgot to tell you that there’s a breath of destruction injected in it by my Senior Sister Ye You using the force of her blue spirit root. You will become a skeleton in at most four hours.”

Only at that instant was there a slight abnormality in Ji Yixuan’s expression.

In the seven spirit roots, there would be changes in the attributes of a spirit from the blue spirit root on.

Blue spirit roots could actively absorb the spirit energy in the world and turn the absorbed spirit energy into the breath of destruction.

Yunxiao Sect produced a rare genius, Ye You, and he naturally heard of it as a Falling Sky Valley disciple.

Although he was unaware of how powerful that Ye You was, even if she did not really cultivate in the future, just solely using the blue spirit root in her body to actively absorb the spirit energy in the world was enough for her to become a Yin Yang True Lord.

If this Kingdom of God really contained Ye You’s breath of destruction as what Yue Tiancheng said, if he could not find a way to escape from the array formation in a short time, he would definitely die in it…

“Ha…” Yue Tiancheng looked at Ji Yixuan who was sealed in the array formation screen and commented spiritedly. “Ji Yixuan, one of the younger generation talents in Falling Sky Valley and a disciple of Perfected Xuanchen, it’s impressive that you understand the sword intent and Worldly Self-Illusion… Yet, ultimately, you still have to die in my hands. It truly is a twist of fate.”
