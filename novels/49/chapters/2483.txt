Upon hearing that, red-gold flames appeared in Ye Qingtang’s eyes and a pair of wings formed on her back. In the blink of an eye, the Yongle Tribe General witnessed Ye Qingtang transforming into an ancient fire phoenix! Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Is… Is your true form? An ancient demonic phoenix?!” The Yongle Tribe General was terrified.

Very quickly, Ye Qingtang returned to her original appearance and shook her head. “This is just a simple divine ability, there’s no need to be alarmed. In fact, any demon can learn it and their combat power will increase greatly.”

A smile was on her face.

Actually, it was impossible for a special ability like that to be activated unless you had that particular bloodline.

Ye Qingtang was merely giving an example. Even if she really wanted to teach these demons, she would never teach them a bloodline divine ability.

“I understand now…” The Yongle Tribe General mused. “It’s just like how Ancestor Qing defeated the West Sea Tribe General with a single move.”

“That’s right. That’s exactly right,” said Ye Qingtang.

“So, Ancestor Qing, are you saying that any one of us demons can learn your divine ability and subdue the West Sea Tribe General with a single move?” A strange light flashed across the Yongle Tribe General’s eyes.

Ye Qingtang, “…”

Was there something wrong with the Yongle Tribe General’s ability to understand things?

You could always learn something but whether you could subdue the West Sea Tribe General… it depended on your own innate ability.

How could it be that any random demon could subdue a West Sea Tribe General after learning just one move?

Was there any such skill? If so, she was willing to spend 100 years of her life learning it!

“Er… I’ll leave it at that for now,” Ye Qingtang said in exasperation.

It was a simple matter but it would take a few days and nights just to explain it to the Yongle Tribe General. In that case, it was better not to dwell on this issue.

“Alright! I understand. Thank you, Demon Emperor. Thank you, Ancestor Qing!” The Yongle Tribe General said excitedly. No matter what it took, he had to learn that technique!

...

“Ancestor Feng… may I ask what your divine ability is?”

After a long time, the Yongle Tribe General looked at Qin Feng. He was extremely curious about Qin Feng’s sword.

Demons never used weapons as the best weapon for demons was their own limbs.

Although there were humans and swords in this realm, the humans here only used their swords as weapons to kill their enemies. They did not use any martial art techniques or divine skills. They were very ordinary. In the eyes of the demons, they were just silly little creatures.

“Me?” Qin Feng pointed at himself. Why was this Yongle Tribe General suddenly singling him out?

“Yes, the human whose skin I am wearing used a similar weapon to yours, but it was just an ordinary and silly instrument. I can’t help but be curious. May I humbly request you to demonstrate its use?” Although he felt that this was a little disrespectful, the Yongle Tribe General could not suppress his curiosity.

“I can do that, but I’m afraid it’ll be too formidable and destroy the Yongle Tribe.” Qin Feng didn’t hesitate to speak out.

His power was not great enough. If the Yongle Tribe General saw through him, their entire ploy would fail.

“Ancestor, you can limit your power. I just want to see how this weapon is used,” said the Yongle Tribe General.

“Alright, how about this.. I won’t use any power, I’ll only demonstrate the technique.”
