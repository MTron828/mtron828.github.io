Chapter 2157: My Student (1)

Meng Yao was stunned. Although Zhang Qiqiu wasn’t considered the best, how could he possibly lose to the useless Jing Ze?

Jing Ze had yet to recover his breathing and everyone’s gazes were still on them. Everything felt like a dream, it felt extremely surreal.

He had won?

He had defeated Zhang Qiqiu?

“What’s going on?” A low voice suddenly came from behind.

The originally noisy crowd suddenly quietened down, and the crowd’s gaze riveted over. All they saw was Di Nuo walking over with a few other students. Looking at the chaotic scene, Di Nuo’s face darkened.

“Teacher Di!” Meng Yao’s eyes lit up the moment she saw Di Nuo. She instantly went in front, putting on an aggrieved expression.

“What happened?” Di Nuo scanned the crowd with furrowed brows. When he spotted Ye Qing amongst the crowd, his expression changed.

“Teacher Ye, what are you doing here?” Though Di Nuo used the term ‘Teacher’ to address her, his entire demeanor showcased his arrogance.

“Teacher Di, quickly come and check on Zhang Qiqiu!” Meng Yao suddenly said.

Di Nuo frowned. Only then did he notice the wretched figure that has collapsed against the wall. He ordered a few students to go over and help the unconscious Zhang Qiqiu up.

Zhang Qiqiu had already lost consciousness at that point in time. He was barely breathing, blood staining his entire body and he looked pathetic.

“Who did this to him?” Di Nuo asked with a cold voice.

The practice arena was the only place in the Netherworld Academy, where students could exchange moves and practice on each other. They knew how far they could go with each other.

Di Nuo’s expression was unpleasant when he saw the unconscious Zhang Qiqiu.

“It’s Jing Ze! Jing Ze wanted to practice with Zhang Qiqiu but we really didn’t expect him to be this ruthless.” Meng Yao had a good relationship with Di Nuo and so without any hesitation, she jumped out and pushed all of the blame onto Jing Ze.

Jing Ze had yet to get a grip over himself and when he heard Meng Yao’s words, he instantly froze. He wanted to explain himself, but Di Nuo had already shot an icy gaze over.

“Kneel down,” Di Nuo ordered.

Jing Ze was taken aback.

“No–”

The speculating youths didn’t dare say a word. They were all witnesses to Meng Yao and Zhang Qiqiu’s provocation but now, Jing Ze was the one to be blamed.

However...

No one dared to get themselves involved in the mess. So they chose to keep quiet.

Jing Ze’s face became pale and his legs started shaking. Out of respect for his teacher, he bent his knees and prepared to kneel.

Before his knees touched the ground, someone grabbed him by the shoulder and made him stand up straight. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Ye Qing, what do you think you are doing?” Di Nuo glared at Ye Qingtang.

“What did Jing Ze do wrong? Why are you making him kneel down?”

“He was ruthless towards his peers, how could you say that he did nothing wrong?” Di Nuo scoffed.

Ye Qing had no expression.

“I came to the Netherworld Academy not too long ago, but I’ve also heard about the practice arena. It’s a place for our students to exchange moves and practice. How is Jing Ze wrong when he was merely practicing with Zhang Qiqiu?”
