Sang Feiyu was clearly in extreme agony but her lips continued to hum that disturbingly relaxed tune...

Splattered across those icy vines were streaks of frozen blood.

Beautiful and gruesome.

“Crack crack...” Sang Feiyu’s jaws strained as they were forced apart, emitting the sounds of bones breaking. Bloodied tears trickled down from her eyes, halted by the extreme chill before they could even fall from her chin.

Ye Qingtang quietly clenched her fists. Although she didn’t have much interaction with Sang Feiyu, she could not bear this morbid scene before her.

“You are unable to save her,” Little White Tiger reminded in a low growl, as it observed her tightly pursed lips.

“I know.” Ye Qingtang lowered her voice. Sang Feiyu was more powerful than her and even she could not escape those icy vines...

“Let’s hurry, we have to keep going. Who knows how many monsters are in this place,” Little White Tiger said.

Ye Qingtang glanced at Sang Feiyu again. She suppressed the impulse she felt welling up inside her, and flew up into the air with Little White Tiger in her arms.

Only by destroying the Cursed True God would those souls trapped in this mystic realm be freed...

Ye Qingtang never expected the first companion she would find to be in such a state. Her already heavy heart grew even more grim.

“It looks like she entered this place when she was trying to escape from the Ice King.”

Ye Qingtang nodded. Previously she still had the intention of sharing the information she had gathered with the others. But she was not so optimistic anymore.

Sang Feiyu was no weakling. In fact, she was even more powerful than herself. But she ended up in such a wretched state, tormented by some monster. She really wondered... how long the others could survive.

Ye Qingtang had just flown a few meters away when that icy vine tree detected her presence. It suddenly shot out countless icy vines toward Ye Qingtang!

“Run!” An anguished cry resonated through the air.

Ye Qingtang’s heart gave a heavy jolt.

It was Sang Feiyu’s voice. Her final rally...

Ye Qingtang didn’t dare to stop. She fled with Little White Tiger in her arms.

Those icy vines seemed to have latched onto Ye Qingtang’s presence. Relentless, they continued flying toward her, trying their best to drag her back to make her their newest plaything.

Pah! Ye Qingtang got a vicious smack in the back by one of the ice vines. A searing pain radiated throughout her entire body. She swayed from the agony and nearly fell from the sky.

Little White Tiger immediately spewed a stream of white flames toward that vine. Ye Qingtang gritted her teeth in pain as she flew desperately away with the little white tiger tight in her arms.

She could not stop!

The ice forest beneath her feet seemed to come alive. Scores of icy vines flew straight up at her like hands from the depths of hell trying to drag her down into the abyss.

She faced the constant danger of imminent death.

“Save me, don’t leave me behind...” Sang Feiyu’s voice suddenly sounded out from somewhere behind Ye Qingtang. She instinctively turned back and saw a frozen, purplish tongue stuck upon one of the ice vines. It vibrated as that spine-chilling voice drifted over to Ye Qingtang’s ears.

It was Sang Feiyu’s tongue...

Boom! A huge explosion sounded out from somewhere in front of Ye Qingtang, followed by a series of tremors which spread through the frozen forest.

Before Ye Qingtang could see what was happening, an immense black figure suddenly barrelled out from within the forest!
