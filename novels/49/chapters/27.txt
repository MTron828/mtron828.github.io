Chapter 28: Buoys (1)

Sporting his chance to bring up a certain request while Mu Su was in a good mood, the manager added quickly: “Your Lordship, there is another matter requiring your attention.”

“What is it?” Mu Su asked.

“A few days ago, we received a letter addressed to your Lordship, delivered by the Si household.” With that said, the manager presented an envelope, which he had kept with him since its receipt.

“The Si household?” Mu Su was intrigued, for the head of the Si household was one of the few who knew his undisclosed identity as owner of the Pavilion of Treasures.

Mu Su unsealed the envelope and as he ran though the letter, his changing countenance reflected the bizarreness of its contents.

“Ye Qingtang from the Ye household wishes to meet up with me?” Mu Su was baffled, his eyes veered towards the antechamber instinctively.

A man seated within the antechamber furrowed his brows.

The manager noticed the change in Mu Su’s line of sight but could not get enough nerve up to take a peek in its direction. He lowered his head further instead.

Last night, there was another person who arrived with Mu Su. Even a dignitary like Mu Su held him in high esteem.

The manager suddenly remembered Mu Su’s allegiance to the Temple of Ancient Splendor… ‘Don’t tell me that person’s the legendary God-Emperor….’ The manager stopped contemplating at this point, his best bet at the moment was to mind his own business.

Mu Su hesitated for a moment before asking, “Who is this Ye Qingtang?”

That night when his Highness visited that girl at the Ye household, he did not manage to get the girl’s name. This Ye Qingtang might be that girl.

The manager answered hastily: “Ye Qingtang is the young lady of the Ye household, and also the heir to the head of the household.”

“Aside from her, are there other young ladies currently staying in their residence?” Mu Su enquired further.

“There’s three young ladies in the Ye household. Ye Qingtang is the daughter of the current head of the household. There’s Ye You, the granddaughter of their Great Elder and also, Ye Xun, the head of the household’s adopted daughter. Ye You had left to join the Cloud Breaker’s clan some time ago while Ye Xun lives in the manor away from their main residence majority of the time. Therefore, Ye Qingtang is the only young lady staying in their residence currently, I reckon.” The manager deduced in detail.

“So, its really her?” Mu Su widened his eyes slightly in surprise.

The manager continued: “Actually, she’s also the one who had provided us with information on the Bent grasses’ location. Miss Ye is currently shopping at our boutique below.”

“…..” Mu Su nearly burst out laughing.

He suffered an internal injury during his younger days and required these Bent grasses as medication. After searching for so many years, who could have thought he would receive salvation from the same girl whom his Highness had sought after.

“Since she’s not only our client, but also our benefactor. We should, of course, reward her. In the future, if she ever shops at our boutiques again, make sure she gets a 20% discount on any item.” Mu Su made a generous offer, while taking a peek at the antechamber from the corner of his eyes.

“Noted, my Lord.” Though the manager nodded, he was actually at a loss for words. What Mu Su had offered, was a discount not only applied to the local boutique in the City of Lin, but across all branches in the continent.

One could only imagine the amount saved when purchasing all those treasures with that discount!

The manager left the room, speechless after all matters were concurred.

After the manager left, the man emerged from the antechamber.

Once Mu Su met him in person, he got up from his desk instantly and got down on one knee.

“Your Highness!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

That glacial yet dashing face remained inscrutable and those deep-set eyes skimmed over the exposed letter on the desk.

“Accept her meeting.” A deep voice resounded.

“By your order, I’ll send the answer straight away.” Mu Su obeyed without any hesitation.

You’re the boss and the boss has the final say!

Anyone would expect that response from his Highness, the only question was, why did Ye Qingtang wish to meet up?
