Chapter 2104: Knowing Beforehand (1)

It was difficult for the winged people to gather their energy with the dantian. Even those who were inherently talented found it hard to gather their energy using the dantian before they were ten years old.

However...

The little winged child found it extremely easy to gather his energy after Ye Qingtang guided him along.

Ye Qingtang was slightly taken aback. The little winged person’s words reminded her.

It was something she had overlooked all along.

Having lived more than 300 years, she could remember the developments over the past 300 years. 300 years was enough for major developments and changes to happen.

Many martial arts foundations were revised over the 300 years to become more stable and refined.

It was the same logic as when the winged people practiced gathering their energy. It was only brought up by a genius winged person after a hundred years.

Ye Qingtang hadn’t been able to stop and calm down this lifetime so she forgot about this point. While she knew many forms of martial arts, it was of martial arts from the 300th year onwards...

“...” Ye Qingtang didn’t know what to do at that moment.

It was certainly remarkable for just anyone to know that much martial arts from 300 years later. However...

Ye Qingtang’s powers from her past life were limited. Most of the changes in martial arts she knew about were merely changes in basic skills.

“Coughs. Now you know.” Ye Qingtang tried her best to not appear guilty. She was worried that her words earlier would attract the attention of the Temple of Paragon.

But thinking about it from another perspective, these were merely basic martial arts. Even if the people from the Temple of Paragon learned about it, they wouldn’t think much of it.

They were so powerful, why would they even care about such basic skills?

But Ye Qingtang didn’t know that everything that happened on the Floating Island was being reported to Elder Hua and the others.

In fact, she had completely underestimated the consequences of saying those words...

In the main hall.

A crystal ball that showed Ye Qingtang floated in the middle of the main hall.

Elder Hua and Elder Bai stood in the main hall.

“A method for winged people to gather their energy?” Elder Bai looked at everything that Ye Qingtang said and did through the crystal ball with knitted brows.

“Elder Yu, you’re from the Clan of Winged People. Do you have anything to say about what she just said?”

Once Elder Bai said that, a glimmer of light appeared on the wall.

A handsome winged man walked out from the portrait. He walked over to the crystal ball, looking at the little winged person who was ecstatic after gathering his energy.

“This is my first time hearing of such a method to gather energy.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Does it work?” Elder Bai asked.

Elder Yu didn’t reply. He carefully watched the little winged person gather his energy.

“Elder Yu?”

Elder Yu retracted his gaze and finally replied, “I believe all of you can already tell whether it works or not.”

The entire main hall went quiet.

Elder Bai asked a redundant question. They all saw with their own eyes that the little winged person successfully gathered his energy with Ye Qingtang’s guidance.

Though it was a basic skill for the clan of winged people, many winged people were stuck there with no way of developing further...

They would waste a huge amount of time just trying to practice that step alone.
