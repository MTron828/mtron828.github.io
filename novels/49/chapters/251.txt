Chapter 250: The Path To The Inner Sect (1)

“Pretty good?” Elder Huang laughed faintly. “Regardless of her nature, one is to speak with their skills in the sect. It is already not easy for Ye Qingtang to pass the sect assessment with such a spirit root. No matter how mature she is, her natural endowments are ultimately not sufficient. She can only be an outer sect disciple at most in this life and will not have any fate with the inner sect.”

Amongst the four factions, only the Sword Faction had the greatest requirement regarding the spirit roots. No matter how outstanding Ye Qingtang’s performance was, it was still useless to the Sword Faction. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The Array Faction elder frowned slightly, dissatisfied with Elder Huang’s words. When the new disciples entered the sect, the elder from the outer sect’s Array Faction had already heard of such a girl from the Elder Qin of the inner sect’s Array Faction. From Elder Qin’s tone, one could tell that he valued Ye Qingtang. However, because Ye Qingtang just entered the sect, Elder Qin suggested to observe her for a period of time before making the final decision.

“There should be more investigations regarding Spirit Condensation Mountain Village. If it is really related to the Blood Moon Sect, it would be serious,” the Fist Faction said, returning to official matters.

With that, the other three elders felt a weight on their minds.

Thousands of years ago, the Blood Moon Sect reigned supreme. Only after great effort from all sects in the world and deaths of many elites was the Blood Moon Sect exterminated.

If the Blood Moon Sect was resurrected, chaos would definitely ensue!

“This matter is serious, and we will need to send people to investigate. We will have to heed the Sect Master’s arrangements regarding the specific plans.”

…

When Ye Qingtang returned from where she met the elders and to her room, Lin Long happened to be in the room as well.

Although Lin Long’s face was slightly pale, she was in a better condition than before.

“Senior Sister Lin, how do you feel now?” Ye Qingtang looked at Lin Long and asked.

Lin Long replied. “The elixirs you gave me before are pretty effective. The physician said that I only need to recuperate for a while to recover.”

The Blood Plague would destroy one’s spirit root. The elixir that Ye Qingtang gave Lin Long to consume could protect the spirit root from being eroded. If her spirit root were broken, it would be difficult for Lin Long to progress any further in the future.

“That’s good.” Ye Qingtang smiled from the bottom of her heart.

Lin Long looked at Ye Qingtang and said, “It is all thanks to you. I still need to recuperate for a while for now, and while there isn’t anything…” Lin Long frowned slightly as disappointment filled her eyes. “The inner sect assessment is one month from now. Given my current condition, I might not be able to participate in it.”

While Lin Long’s tone was calm, but a hint of regret could still be heard from her words.

The difference between the inner sect and outer sect was huge in a sect. To become truly powerful, the only way was to enter the inner sect. However, there was only one assessment for outer sect disciples to convert to inner sect disciples every year. Given Lin Long’s current condition, it was probable that there was no way she could take part in it.

Ye Qingtang heard Lin Long’s words, and the expression in her eyes changed.

Lin Long did not notice Ye Qingtang’s emotions and continued. “But you don’t need to worry. It is still early for you. New disciples cannot participate in the inner sect assessment in their first year in the sect. You can use this one year plus to focus on cultivation in preparation for the coming year.”

Nevertheless, Ye Qingtang was unable to be as relaxed.

Ye Qingtang’s real goal of entering Xuanling Sect was to enter the inner sect, and only through entering the inner sect would she be able to narrow the distance between her and Ye You.

Ye You was currently the final disciple of Yunxiao Sect’s Sect Master, but she was still merely an outer sect disciple of Xuanling Sect. The gap between the two of them was like a chasm.

She must enter the inner sect in the shortest time possible!
