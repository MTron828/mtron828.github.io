Chapter 654: It’s Actually You (4)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Swoosh!

As the black-robed person slapped a hand out, a terrifying martial aura was instantly released like a rapid torrent, and it could not be countered.

After sensing the martial aura of the black-robed person, Ye Qingtang was slightly stunned.

This black-robed person was extremely powerful and had already entered the Yin Yang Perfected Lord state!

Fortunately, the elderly’s skills were only at the Yin Lord state of the Yin Yang Perfected Lord state and was at the First Heaven of Yin Lord.

If Ye Qingtang had not absorbed the demonic aura from the black ball and hastily fought with the black-robed person, she would probably have been easily killed within ten moves. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

However, the current Ye Qingtang had also become a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord. With the mental state and experience of a Holy Venerate in her previous life, she had no fear even if she faced an ordinary Yin Lord.

As the black-robed person landed an extremely powerful slap, Ye Qingtang did not retreat and charged forward instead. She raised her palm and slapped it out at the black-robed person as well.

Boom! Boom!

In the next second, a thunderous explosion rang in the palace. An invisible hurricane gushed in the surroundings with a horrifying sound.

“F*ck you!!”

The little white tiger in Ye Qingtang’s arms initially peeked its head out to take a look. However, the force of the impact of the slap caused the little white tiger to be flung out from Ye Qingtang’s arms.

In the next second, both Ye Qingtang and the black-robed person retreated several steps.

“You…”

The black-robed person steadied himself and looked at Ye Qingtang in extreme shock.

This girl had actually raised her martial skills to half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord in such a short amount of time. How exactly did she do it?!

No matter what encounters a cultivator had, they still needed to correspond and be compatible with their mental state.

If an ordinary Martial Qi Level One cultivator obtained a powerful destiny and leaped into the Yin Yang Perfected Lord state, the overly-fast advancement in cultivation state would result in frightening mental demons due to the incompatibility between one’s mental state and martial skills. As a result, it would be easy to have Qi Deviation, and it could ruin the cultivator’s foundation, causing all of their cultivation to be abolished. They might even drop dead on the spot if serious!

The logic was very simple: suddenly obtaining the skills of a Yin Yang Perfected Lord without the mental state of a Yin Yang Perfected Lord would cause an unforeseen accident.

However, Ye Qingtang was a Holy Venerate in her previous life, and her mental state was that of a Holy Venerate. No matter how fast her skills advanced, it did not matter even if she returned to her peak state as a Holy Venerate in a night.

However, the black-robed person knew none of that.

“Ye Qingtang… you’re really a talented genius… If you can leave this mainland and properly cultivate, you will definitely become a true powerful figure one day. However, you chose to protect the source of this mainland’s sin.” The black-robed person sighed as he looked at Ye Qingtang.

“Protect the source of sin?” Ye Qingtang laughed coldly. “I am not as noble as you said. I’m only protecting my family, martial siblings, and masters.”

What had the lives and deaths of others got to do with her? Even if this black-robed person killed all living things in the world, it had not a slight thing to do with Ye Qingtang.

However, if it implicated her family and friends, Ye Qingtang would stop it no matter the price. Even if she would fall into the lowest level of hell for eternity, she would turn into an evil spirit, crawl out from hell, and pull those people under the ground!

“Ye Qingtang, you’re still so stubborn… I wanted to spare your life, but you wanted to court death. Don’t blame me then.” A cold glint flashed across the black-robed person’s eyes.
