Chapter 864 Crown Prince

Perfected Gu Yun’s face was clouded. He finally understood the reason why Ling Yan had to come to this piece mainland.

Previously, Perfected Gu Yun did not even bother about whether Ling Yan was looking for the fated person.

However, if the lady with the Supreme Token was not Ling Yan’s fated person, how could he ward off the sword for her based on his personality?! F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Perfected Gu Yun waved his right arm to cast a mystic technique immediately.

A vague and virtual shadow appeared in the mid-air on top of Perfected Gu Yun within a short while.

There was a man around forty years old appearing in the virtual shadow. He wore a nine-claw wyrm robe that made him look extremely noble.

“Crown Prince.” Perfected Gu Yun greeted towards the middle-aged man.

The man waved his hand and said, “How?”

“Ling Yan has found his fated person, Your Highness…” Perfected Gu Yun said.

A cold glint flashed across the man’s eyes after hearing Perfected Gu Yun’s words.

Ling Yan had a karma bloodline. The consequences would be unimaginable if he found his fated person. The only power that he dreaded of in the entire Eternal Dynasty was Ling Yan. His father also thought highly of Ling Yan. If Ling Yan met his fated person, he might not be the prince heir anymore…

“Is it true?” The man’s face darkened.

“It’s true, Your Highness. Ling Yan entered the Dragon Vein alone these days and did not allow me to follow. Then, I chose to enter the place first and wait for his appearance to observe him secretly. I just witnessed that he was willing to sacrifice himself and ward off the sword for a lady.” Perfected Gu Yun explained.

“Who is that lady? Is she from your mainland?” the Crown Prince of the Eternal Dynasty asked.

“

Perfected Gu Yun shook his head and said, “I thought that she was from this mainland at first… However, the lady held the Supreme Token and saved a few students of the Supreme Academy. Though I did not hear what they were talking about, they seemed to be very close.”

“You’re saying that the Supreme Academy did not side towards me wholeheartedly…” Cold glints flashed in the Crown Prince’s eyes continuously.

“I’m not sure about that…” Perfected Gu Yun shook his head.

“Humph! I was still wondering why the Supreme Academy would choose to side with me so easily and agree to help me to take down Ling Yan… If they sided with Ling Yan first, they definitely followed Ling Yan’s instructions and were on the undercover job by pretending to side with me…” The Crown Prince smashed the table in front of him into pieces.

“It’s not totally impossible, Crown Prince…” Perfected Gu Yun said. “The President of the Supreme Academy eliminated the Execution Sect according to Ling Yan’s command. However, the Execution Sect was still fighting back resistantly to now and is yet to be destroyed… The Execution Sect has definitely surrendered to Ling Yan’s sect forces. If the President of the Supreme Academy also listened to Ling Yan, the attack on the Execution Sect by the Supreme Academy was not real. They would not go harsh on them… I’m afraid that this is the reason why the Execution Sect is still not destroyed even though their strength is weaker than the Supreme Academy.”

“You don’t need to worry about that. Remember, kill Ling Yan’s fated person no matter what happens. Kill Ling Yan as well if you have the chance,” the Crown Prince said coldly.

“Rest assured, Crown Prince.” Perfected Gu Yun nodded his head and said. The virtual shadow disappeared when he waved his right arm again.
