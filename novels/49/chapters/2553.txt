Chapter 2554: Dragon Emperor Clan (14)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Damn you. Why are you bringing me along? I want to rest…” The big yellow dog protested in Ye Qingtang’s arms.

Ye Qingtang glanced at the big yellow dog. Did it really think that she wanted to bring it along with her wherever she went? If they were not in the Dragon Emperor Clan, she would not be bothered with it. She was just worried that it would run around and cause trouble.

Standing in front of the Blood Moon Elder’s room, Ye Qingtang kicked the door open.

The Blood Moon Elder was sitting at the guest table, eating the elixirs and delicacies on the table.

“Holy Lady… you… are here… Let’s eat together…” The Blood Moon Elder mumbled through his full mouth as he wiped the grease on his lips. He waved at her.

“Aren’t you afraid that the food is poisoned?” Ye Qingtang sat at the side casually.

Looking at the Blood Moon Elder eating happily, Ye Qingtang could not help but comment. She had been worrying herself to death, while the Blood Moon Elder was just happily stuffing himself in the guest room of the Dragon Emperor Clan.

The Blood Moon Elder was stunned by Ye Qingtang’s words. He was shocked and in disbelief. “Holy Lady… how is that possible? That can’t be! This is the Dragon Emperor Clan! I don’t believe they would do such a thing. Moreover, it’s so easy for them to kill us. There’s no need to bring us back and poison us… it would be a waste of such good food and elixirs. There’s no reason for that!”

Ye Qingtang could not help looking at the Blood Moon Elder with renewed light. His intelligence level had increased by quite a lot during this period of time. He had already learned to infer things.

“Holy Lady, don’t worry. The Dragon Emperor Clan is a great evil sect. Poisoning is a despicable and shameless thing that only the low-class evil sects would carry out. The Dragon Emperor Clan will definitely disdain such actions. Holy Lady, don’t worry and eat it. If you die from the food, you can just blame me then.” The Blood Moon Elder smiled when he saw that Ye Qingtang was unmoved.

“Then what class of evil are you?” Ye Qingtang stared at the Blood Moon Elder with a chuckle.

“Holy Lady, I… I guess I belong to the lower classes…” The Blood Moon Elder looked a little embarrassed. It was true that he had often poisoned others.

“Previously, the people from the Dragon Emperor Clan said that you could not endure the demonic energy here. How do you feel now?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Holy Lady, the Dragon Emperor Clan gave me an elixir and I’m much better now. It’s nothing major,” the Blood Moon Elder replied honestly.

“Also, Holy Lady, the Dragon Emperor Clan is really too magnanimous. This food and this bottle of elixirs are simply too luxurious… just by taking these elixirs, I can feel that my strength will soon surge!” The Blood Moon Elder was rather excited.

Ye Qingtang did not refute the Blood Moon Elder’s words regarding this. It was indeed as he said. These elixirs were indeed very rare and were extremely useful to cultivators.

“By the way, Holy Lady, I wanted to ask you earlier but didn’t get the chance… Holy Lady, what’s your relationship with that elder from the Dragon Emperor Clan? Why would he treat you so well? He summoned a carriage for you and even brought us to this place as guests. Holy Lady, are you that elder’s illegitimate daughter?” The Blood Moon Elder looked at Ye Qingtang curiously.

The corners of Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched.. The Blood Moon Elder’s imagination was indeed rich.
