Han Cangming?!

Ye Qingtang was completely stunned this time.

Ye Qingtang was all too familiar with this name.

The Demon God, Han Cangming, that powerful and mysterious man.

“Are you talking about the Demon God?” Ye Qingtang asked hurriedly.

The young man was confused. “Demon God? What Demon God… I heard that the powerful figure called Han Cangming is about to be conferred the title of Third Emperor. But it has not been announced yet. Sister Qingtang, the Heavenly Emperor seems to have a grudge against Han Cangming and has

been chasing after him. Han Cangming has not appeared much during this period of time.”

“Heavenly Emperor… I…”

Ye Qingtang stood rooted to the ground in deep thought.

Indeed, the Heavenly Emperor was in the Third Domain. The Blood Moon Holy Lord was a clone of the Heavenly Emperor, so Ye Qingtang had quite a few memories of the Heavenly Emperor.

“By the way, Sister Qingtang, is there something called the Dragon Emperor Clan in your Mixed Heavens Holy Domain? They have been very famous recently. Their reputation has even spread to the Divine Venerate Domain,” the young man added.

“Oh, how did they become famous?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“The Dragon Emperor Clan was originally a branch of a major demon faction in the Divine Venerate Domain. After falling out with the headquarters, they left the Divine Venerate Domain and went to the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain. Recently, there were rumors that the Dragon Emperor Clan wanted to

control the entire Second Domain. Even a few Immortal Emperors were alarmed.” The youth smiled at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang,”..”

Had the reputation of the Dragon Emperor Clan spread to the Third Domain?

“Sister Qingtang, there are many powerful experts in this world. I’m just a Divine Lord, like an ant… sigh, but I swear that I will become a powerful practitioner too. When I grow up, I want my name to shake the world!” The young man’s gaze was firm.

Ye Qingtang smiled.

This youth was behaving rather childishly. He was about 12 or 13 years old, and his heart filled with surging hot blood and naivety. He did not have the maturity which most children who grew up in clans had. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“What’s your name?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Sister Qingtang, my name is Feng Jiuyou!” the young man said.

“Feng Jiuyou?” Ye Qingtang stared at the youth in shock.

The one who destroyed the Sky Moon Tower with one slash of his sword. Don’t ask when Feng Jiuyou will return?!

The Third Domain, Sage Emperor of Swords… Feng Jiuyou?!

Before Ye Qingtang was born, Feng Jiuyou was already famous throughout the world. He was the Sword Emperor and the focal point of the entire world. He once destroyed the famous Sky Moon Tower in the Third Domain with a single slash of his sword. After that, he disappeared without a trace and

never appeared again!

‘That was why there was a saying in the future: “The one who destroyed the Sky Moon Tower with one slash of his sword. Don’t ask when Feng Jiuyou will return’.

But… which era was Feng Jiuyou from?

That was a legendary figure from the same era as the Heavenly Emperor and Han Cangming. Furthermore, how long had Feng Jiuyou disappeared for?

‘When Feng Jiuyou dominated the world, her own ancestors had probably not even been born yet

Although the Heavenly Emperor, Han Cangming and the others were still alive, the lifespans of those experts were over tens of thousands of years.

“Feng Jiuyou, let me ask you… Has the Heavenly Demon Tribe invaded the Third Domain?” Ye Qingtang asked as she stared at the youth.

Ye Qingtang read from history books that a few generations ago, there was a powerful race known as the Heavenly Demon Tribe. They broke through their seal and invaded the Divine Venerate Domain. In this world, there was no one who did not know about the Heavenly Demon Tribe.

They were a terrifying race that had once plunged the entire world into despair.

The young man tilted his head and asked curiously, “Sister Qingtang, what is this Heavenly Demon Tribe?”
