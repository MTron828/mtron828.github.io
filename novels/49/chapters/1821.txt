Chapter 1822: Cursed True God (3)

Ye Qingtang and Little White Tiger discussed for a long time, but failed to ascertain what happened at that final moment tens of thousands of years ago.

While they were still debating, Little Heavenly Demon waddled over to Tu Fu’s body. With eyes wide with curiosity, it gazed up at the Heavenly Demon who had died all those years ago.

“Uh... is it okay to let this little kid stare at the dead body of one of its own kind?” Ye Qingtang couldn’t help feeling worried at Little Heavenly Demon’s curious expression. Would the sight of the corpse of this Heavenly Demon leave a scar on its young, impressionable mind? Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Please... it is a Heavenly Demon. Do you think it’s some innocent little puppy? Heavenly Demons are capable of killing each other, the mere sight of a corpse is nothing to it. Instead of worrying about that, you should worry about whether it might take a bite out of that corpse.” Little White Tiger snorted.

The image of Little Heavenly Demon gnawing on the body of that True God was still fresh in their minds.

Ye Qingtang was speechless...

But before Ye Qingtang could say another word, Little Heavenly Demon suddenly reached out one little paw and tapped Tu Fu’s leg.

That Heavenly Demon corpse, which had been maintained perfectly in that state for tens of thousands of years, instantly disintegrated with that one tap.

The tall, strapping figure collapsed into a heap of black dust which scattered across the ground.

“Cough cough cough... damn you little punk. Were you really going to eat it?!” Little White Tiger was coughing so intensely that tears had sprung to its eyes. If not for the fact that it was no match for Little Heavenly Demon, it would have already given it a sound thrashing!

Ye Qingtang was astounded by the disintegrated body.

“Why did it suddenly disintegrate...”

That demon hand holding the key had been fine when she retrieved the key from its grasp. It even felt rather firm and bouncy, as if it had just been chopped off. But Tu Fu’s corpse instantly disintegrated with just one light touch?

“Who knows? It might have something to do with the totem behind him. It is too dusty here, are you done? Let’s go if you are.” Little White Tiger was still coughing badly.

Ye Qingtang gave one last look at the totem on the wall, memorizing it. She then turned and left the underground palace, with the sniffling Little White Tiger and the dazed Little Heavenly Demon in her arms.

Upon returning to the surface, the rain of fire was still going strong. Towering flames spread across the entire earth, but the singing voice of that woman was nowhere to be heard.

“When is this rain of fire going to stop? Will it go on forever? We will waste away in this place if it doesn’t stop...” Little White Tiger gazed despondently at the blazing sky.

Ye Qingtang took stock of the food in her space ring. As little Heavenly Demon was now awake, her supplies had been depleting very quickly. While Ye Qingtang could go without food for up to two weeks without any problem, Little Heavenly Demon on the other hand...

She didn’t forget the way Little Heavenly Demon would eye Little White Tiger when it was hungry.

When all their food supplies were depleted, Little Heavenly Demon might just kick Little White Tiger out to roast in the rain of fire, so that it could eat it.

“It’s a pity that my Dharma treasures are ineffective here. Otherwise, I can use something to ward off the fiery rain.” Ye Qingtang sighed softly.

Wait...

Having suddenly thought of something, she took out those two halves of the key from her space ring.
