Ye Qingtang did not plan to analyze what the God of Nature meant. It was hard for him to be generous to give one thousand nebula points. Ye Qingtang was about to select some treasures from the Stars Pavilion but found out that…

The Stars Pavilion could not even be opened!

“I forgot to tell you that the nebula points you obtained can only be used to exchange for items in the Stars Pavilion the next time you enter the world of constellations,” the God of Nature said leisurely.

She fell into his trap once again!

Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched a little. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

And she was wondering why the God of Nature was so generous! So this was waiting for her!

“How? Do you want to enter other worlds of constellations?” The radiant ball said awkwardly as the constellations behind it shone brightly.

Ye Qingtang resisted her strong urge to rip that radiant ball apart. “There’s no need.”

She had been in that mainland for several months and did not know if the time inside and outside was similar. It was time she came out.

As for the Stars Pavilion…

She can just come in the future. Although the God of Nature was a little cunning, the worlds of constellations in the Illusory Void were excellent places to cultivate.

The radiant ball was displeased, but he did not say anything. However, that radiant ball diminished in size until it disappeared completely as though… he was a little angry.

Ye Qingtang did not care whether he was angry or not. The moment the main entrance to the Illusory Void behind her appeared, she carried the little white tiger and walked out of the door.

The tightly-shut door was opened slowly, and Ye Qingtang finally left that Illusory Void. The instant the door opened, she saw two identical figures standing still outside the door.

“Ah Yao~” Seeing that Ye Qingtang walked out of the Illusory Void, Ming Gu immediately leaped into her arms and rubbed his face in her arms excitedly.

“Ah Yao, you left for such a long time. I thought that you’d leave and not come back again.” Ming Gu mumbled.

She left for a long time?

Ye Qingtang raised her brow. She could not really have stayed in the Illusory Void for a few months, could she?

“Fool,” Ming Wang said coldly from aside. Subsequently, he walked to Ye Qingtang and kneeled on a knee abruptly.

“Holy Lord, the past five days have been tough.”

Ye Qingtang looked at Ming Wang. Although he still had an indifferent expression, Ye Qingtang clearly felt that his attitude toward her changed for some reason.

However…

It had been a few months in the Illusory Void, but it had only been five days on the Central Mainland?

At the thought that she was still a Yin Yang Perfected Lord Tenth Heaven five days ago but an Arcane Supremacy Eighth Heaven now, Ye Qingtang was extremely elated.

She advanced a whole realm in just five days.

Who could compare to such a cultivation speed?

Instantly, Ye Qingtang made up her mind to make good use of this Illusory Void in the future if she was free. Perhaps she could reach the Holy Venerate realm inside in about a year.

It must be known that Ye Qingtang only reached the Holy Venerate after living for three hundred years. If she could achieve that stage in a year, it would be such a sweet feeling…

Of course, Ye Qingtang was aware that the faster the cultivation, the more dangerous the constellation.

“Holy Lord, you must be tired. Do return to rest.” Ming Wang spoke the same way as before and with a hint of toughness in his tone. However, the difference in his attitude was evident.

In the past, this tough tone was used to test her, but now, it was to mask his worry and care.
