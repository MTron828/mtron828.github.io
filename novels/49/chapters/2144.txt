Chapter 2145: You Can’t Leave (1)

The teachers more or less knew that Meng Yao and the others were bullying Mu Ziying, but they only turned a blind eye, indirectly condoning it. After all, a person like Mu Ziying wasn’t suitable to stay at the Netherworld Academy. It was rumored that she would be expelled from the academy, which was why Meng Yao and the others dared to treat her that way.

However, Meng Yao had never expected that this young person in front of her would claim to be Mu Ziying’s teacher.

Meng Yao wasn’t silly. Though she had no idea why Ye Qingtang did that, she immediately said, “Teacher, this is a misunderstanding. We didn’t do anything to Mu Ziying.”

Meng Yao then looked at the dazed Mu Ziying and continued, “Sister Ziying, am I right? We were merely having some fun with you earlier.”

“Exactly. We have a good relationship with Mu Ziying, it’s just a misunderstanding.” The other girls started speaking up. They might have sounded nice but they glared at Mu Ziying with a threatening gaze.

Once Mu Ziying saw their unkind gazes, she lowered her head quietly. Mu Ziying’s silence was taken as consent and they were pleased with the outcome.

This teacher would be able to catch them in the act once, but certainly not every single time. If Mu Ziying were to say anything against them, they would make sure to “take good care” of her.

Ye Qingtang saw Mu Ziying’s reaction. Without any expression on her face, Ye Qingtang lifted her arm, and the black flames dissipated.

Meng Yao heaved a sigh of relief after she regained freedom, she wanted to leave right away with the others. As she walked past Mu Ziying, she shot a threatening gaze at Mu Ziying, and in a soft voice, she said, “You’re lucky this time but next time, no one will save you. You’d better watch out...”

In response, Mu Ziying only stood there on the spot, lowering her head and not saying a word.

Meng Yao and the others were about to leave when Ye Qingtang suddenly spoke.

“Did I say that you could leave?”

Meng Yao was stunned. She instantly turned around to look at Ye Qingtang. One of her friends started pulling on the dazed Mu Ziying’s arm while acting friendly. “Teacher, we already explained ourselves. This is a misunderstanding, Sister Ziying and I...”

“What does that have to do with me?” Ye Qingtang said with a nonchalant tone.

Meng Yao’s face stiffened. What just happened? Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Would this young teacher start making things difficult for her just because of Mu Ziying?

“What... else do you have for us?” Meng Yao asked.

“What is the 321st clause of the academy rules?” Ye Qingtang asked.

Meng Yao froze. Only then she recalled being rude to Ye Qingtang and her expression darkened.

Who the hell even knew that she was a teacher!

When did the Netherworld Academy even have a Paragon Sixth Heaven Level teacher?

“F-Fifteen strokes of flogging for being rude towards a teacher...” Meng Yao stammered.

Ye Qingtang nodded. “Great, so it seems you understand the rules.”

Once Ye Qingtang said that, a whip magically appeared in her hand. Flexing her wrist, a crisp sound resulted from the cane. It was as loud as thunder and the girls were terrified.

“T-Teacher, what are you doing?” All the color on Meng Yao’s face drained to a blotchy white as she looked at the whip and had an ominous feeling of dread.
