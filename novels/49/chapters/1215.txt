1216 Rise Of The Phoenix 2

When the white-robed old man reappeared again, he was at the scene.

“What’s that?”

The white-robed old man stared at Ye Qingtang, his brow deeply furrowed. He could not see Ye Qingtang’s features clearly. In the void, all that was visible to the naked eye was flames.

The white-robed old man was not even sure where the flames had come from or what they symbolized.

Swoosh!

The white-robed old man gathered his Heavenly Venerate power to form a golden long sword. With a slight sweep of his right arm, the long sword slashed at the golden flames with the speed of lightning.

But as the white-robed old man looked on in astonishment, when the golden sword slashed at the flames, it was like water sinking into dirt. It did not even create a ripple.

“What on earth is that…” The white-robed old man looked perplexed and bewildered.

Boom!

After a moment, an explosion rang out and spread through a radius of a hundred miles. The golden flames that looked like a small sun finally dissipated. An aloof-looking girl floated in the void. She was filled with a divine glow, making it seem as if a real god had appeared.

The girl floating in the void was Ye Qingtang, who was supposed to be dead!

The white-robed old man’s eyes filled with disbelief when he saw Ye Qingtang standing unharmed before him.

He had clearly thrust the long sword formed from his Heavenly Venerate power through Ye Qingtang. He had even destroyed all her internal organs. She was almost certainly doomed…

Even Ye Qingtang was completely taken aback, not to mention the white-robed old man.

When Ye Qingtang saw her unharmed body, her expression was filled with shock.

She clearly remembered that she had died. But somehow, the remaining Divine Phoenix Bloodline in her body caused her to undergo the Rise of the Phoenix and be reborn from the ashes…

Besides that, her shattered organs were completely restored after her rebirth. Even the iron door in her Dantian leading to the Tenth Heaven of Yin Yang Perfected Lord, which had never appeared before, had been shattered by the flames. This allowed Ye Qingtang to comprehend many mysteries and enter the Tenth Heaven of Yin Yang Perfected Lord…

“Ahah… ant from an inferior mainland, I have underestimated you.” At that moment, the white-robed old man looked at Ye Qingtang, who was in the void. His lips curved upwards slightly, arching in a bone-chilling smile. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Although this was somewhat surprising, it was of no consequence.

Swoosh!

The white-robed old man’s eyes instantly sharpened. A few golden long swords formed and slashed at Ye Qingtang together.

But Ye Qingtang now had no fear of the golden long swords formed from the accumulation of the white-robed old man’s Heavenly Venerate power.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang raised her right arm slightly. From her position in the void, she gently reached out with her finger.

To the white-robed old man’s disbelief, the long sword he formed from his Heavenly Venerate power instantly exploded before his eyes.

At that moment, an invisible screen enclosed Ye Qingtang and the white-robed old man.

The space within the screen was filled with an immense and terrifying aura of the Great Dao.

“Realm of the Great Dao …impossible…” The golden-robed old man was in a state of disbelief.

Only powerful cultivators who had entered the realm of Heavenly Venerate could hope to comprehend even a little of the Realm of the Great Dao.

In this world, there were very few who could comprehend the Realm of the Great Dao. Even in the Ancient You Clan, only one person had understood the rules of the Great Dao and had hence created the Realm of the Great Dao.

This girl standing before him was a mere Yin Yang Perfected Lord. How could she comprehend the Realm of the Great Dao?!
