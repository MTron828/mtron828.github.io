Chapter 1758: Demon Cave (2)

“Forget it. Look at how small the skin is. Only such a small demon can wear it. It’ll rip if you try to wear it.” The demon who had brought Ye Qingtang back was evidently a master at wearing human skin.

Still, the persistent demon remained unsatisfied and he reached out to pinch Ye Qingtang’s supple skin again. It was extremely strong and almost took away a part of Ye Qingtang’s flesh. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Stop saying these useless things. The west side has been very restless lately. I’ve fought with them quite a few times recently with no clear winner in the end, so you’d better be careful. I don’t think they’re going to give up so easily.” The demon who had brought Ye Qingtang back turned serious as the other demons’ expressions darkened slightly and they stopped talking nonsense. They began talking about the matter regarding the camps.

As Ye Qingtang stood there tensely, the demons pushed her aside so that she could look for demons her own age in the cave. She was so weak that they didn’t bother with speaking to her.

Ye Qingtang was chased away like livestock but she didn’t feel offended at all. Instead, she breathed a sigh of relief.

A group of demons had been summoned so suddenly but none of them had realized her true identity. Her disguise must have fooled their sense of smell for now. She got bolder as she realized this and her wary gaze relaxed.

This was the camp of the eastern demons. There was a huge cave in the deep of the valley which was so dark no one could make anything out. Many demons gathered outside the cave with their hands full of fresh blood and flesh. It didn’t look like it belonged to humans or demons and looked like flesh from the monster.

Ye Qingtang walked over to the cave and found a group of smaller and weaker-looking demons at the entrance.

These demons were about as tall as a 10 to 15 year-old child. Their bodies were thinner as well and their features were not yet as grotesque.

This place was filled with demons and their skins were either brown or gray, but the little fiendish demons had lighter skin and didn’t look as terrifying. If Ye Qingtang’s guess was right, these better-looking demons were the little fiendish demons the other demon had been talking about.

At this moment, the little fiendish demons were gathered together and chowing down on the flesh they were holding. They looked extremely timid as well, their gazes cautious as they looked at the adult demons around them.

Demons ate their own kind too. Since they respected the strong and the little fiendish demons had yet to increase their strength, they were nothing but trash in front of these adult demons. If they were to be stupid enough to anger an adult demon, they might just be devoured.

The demons looked at Ye Qingtang with awe as she walked over, unlike the adult demons who disregarded her.

“Great... Great Sage...” A small demon looked nervously at the approaching Ye Qingtang, its heart filled with fear.

‘Great Sage’ was what the demons called powerful demons. It was akin to the human’s version of ‘Master’.

When Ye Qingtang heard the little fiendish demon call her Great Sage, she stiffened...

“Great Sage... would you like to eat?” A few small demons looked at Ye Qingtang whom they thought was in human skin. They were extremely afraid, and took from the pile of meat the freshest piece which they presented to Ye Qingtang.
