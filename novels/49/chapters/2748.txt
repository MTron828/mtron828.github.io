Chapter 2749: The Owner Of The Heart Of The Heavenly Dao (4)

Ye Qingtang finally realized what had happened to her.

No wonder she met Han Cangming and Ah Yao met the Heavenly Emperor. It was all planned…

The only difference was that Han Cangming had seen through fate. He had separated his body from his soul and reincarnated his soul into Ling Yan. He was unwilling to become this woman’s chess piece, but the Heavenly Emperor did not realize this.

“Unfortunately, in my first life, I was the Ah Yao you mentioned. Her potential was insufficient and she could only become an Immortal Emperor. She did not have enough resources to nourish the heart. That’s why I had you. You are very good and did not disappoint me. You are very powerful.” Ah Yao stared at Ye Qingtang.

“Aren’t you a divine soul? Why do you have a body?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Body…” Ah Yao explained softly,” In your previous life… which was after Ah Yao died, I took her body. My soul entered her body and I am using it. ”

“There’s one more question. Are you… the God of Nature?!” Ye Qingtang’s eyes flickered coldly.

“The God of Nature… I’m not. He is my brother,” said Ah Yao. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Before Ye Qingtang could say anything, Ah Yao said, “That’s not right… you extracted half of the power in my heart?”

Ye Qingtang did not deny it. “That’s right.”

“Yes, you are more outstanding than I expected…” Ah Yao smiled.” Now, you can return to my arms. We will return to being one. I want to kill my brother and snatch his Heavenly Dao energy. This way, I can become the next Tian.”

“Sorry.” Ye Qingtang stared at the woman. “I refuse.”

The woman was slightly surprised. “Why? You and I are one, including Ah Yao… Why do you refuse to return?”

“Perhaps we were one in the past… but not anymore.” Ye Qingtang stared at Ah Yao. “I am me. I have my own thoughts. I have family and friends… and all of that has nothing to do with you. If possible, we can become friends and I can return your heart. But we can never be the same person again.”

Ye Qingtang knew that this woman was not lying. In fact, she had an inexplicable resonance with this woman.

“But if you don’t return, I won’t be able to surpass what I once was, much less defeat my brother and become the next Tian.” The woman’s gaze gradually turned cold.

“I’m sorry.” Ye Qingtang shook her head. “This has nothing to do with me… however, the God of Nature killed my parents. He is also my enemy. If you need me, I will help you deal with him. I’ve said before that we can be friends, but we can never be the same person.”

“I understand now… It’s like an avatar who has left the main body for too long and developed its own consciousness… but you are only a portion of my soul. I am the main body and my words are the heavenly decree. You have no right to refuse.”

Ah Yao stood up slowly and approached Ye Qingtang. “Your friends, your family and everything around you is nothing in my eyes. If I let them live, they will live. If I let them die, they will die, including you… yet, you dare to refuse me and even want to become an equal existence to me. You… deserve to die. I will suck away your power and exorcise your independent consciousness.”
