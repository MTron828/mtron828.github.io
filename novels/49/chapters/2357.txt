Chapter 2358: Get Lost (2)

But she had been greatly weakened by her match with Mu Ziying.

Although she could walk now, it would still be some time before she would fully recover. In her current state, there was no way she could compete in the Inter-Academy Competition.

So of course she hated them.

Di Nuo was her teacher. If he was well, he might be able to help her recuperate faster. But he had been injured by Ye Qing and couldn’t even help himself. Meng Yao’s last hope was extinguished just like that.

At this point, Meng Yao was just aching to tear Ye Qing apart.

Meng Yao’s voice attracted several people. The training arena was crowded in the first place, and several bystanders gathered around them. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Most of them had heard of the bet between Di Nuo and Ye Qing, But no one knew the reason behind that bet.

Thereafter, there was Di Nuo’s match against Ye Qing during the medicine faculty’s selection trials. This made those students even more confused over the reason behind everything.

Now, Meng Yao had spoken out and pushed all the blame onto Ye Qing, making it sound like Ye Qing had schemed against Di Nuo and purposely injured him badly, just because she was at odds with him.

Meng Yao’s words stunned Lei Yan and his group.

They had met shameless people, but they had never met someone that shameless!

Their Boss was the instigator?

If Di Nuo had not been so overbearing, would their Boss be so free as to challenge him? It was clearly Di Nuo who had forced Ye Qing to a match to prove himself. Now Meng Yao dared to turn around and accuse the victim?

“Your words are truly hilarious. Our Boss is big-hearted and benevolent. He doesn’t even intend to pursue the matter. Have you and your Master not had enough yet? Who was the one who tried to force our Boss out of the Netherworld Academy? Who was the one who claimed that our Boss had someone outside of the academy teach us? It’s all your teacher’s doing!”

“What? Now that you have lost, you refuse to concede? If your teacher has the guts, he should crawl out of the Netherworld Academy in accordance with the bet!” Lei Yan was so angry that he felt like laughing. He had never met someone so thick-skinned!

Meng Yao replied, “Scoundrel. You are just a student, how dare you be so rude to a teacher? What bet? It’s all just talk, there’s no proof.”

“You were so rude to our Boss too. What do you say to that?” Lei Yan retorted.

“Shut up.” A low voice rang out.

The crowd turned toward the voice and saw a pale-faced Di Nuo. Accompanied by several teenagers, he was walking into the training arena.

Meng Yao was taken aback by the sight of Di Nuo. “Master, why have you come out?”

Di Nuo looked extremely unwell and his aura was very weak.

He was a teacher from the martial arts faculty and was a familiar sight to all the students in the training arena. Seeing how the usually robust and imperious Di Nuo now looked so frail, many of the teenagers, who didn’t know the truth, unwittingly started to believe in Meng Yao’s words.

To be fair, it was rather common for the teachers to have occasional sparring matches. But no one had ever witnessed a teacher dealing such a heavy blow to another.

Those teenagers did not know Ye Qing well, only hearing rumors about him. Now, they started to feel that it was better to stay away from this vicious teacher.

“Meng Yao, the world has only ever respected winners. There’s nothing we can do about that. You have yet to fully recover, no need to go around talking about this,” Di Nuo said impassively.

Meng Yao twisted her lips.
