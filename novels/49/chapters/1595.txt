Chapter 1596 Brutal Little Fellow 3

The bugle call from outside became increasingly louder. General Mark did not dare to hesitate any longer and immediately put on his armor before leading the soldiers to the battlefield with Ye Qingtang following behind them.

On the battlefield, the troops of the allied forces were densely packed, and with one glance, one could tell that there were multiple times more troops than before!

General Mark’s heart turned cold with just a look, and his expression darkened even further when he saw the 5,000 soldiers in golden armor in the center of the allied forces’ troops.

Golden armor. That’s the Glorious Lion Knights battle armor!

The Glorious Lion Knights actually deployed 5,000 people!

It must be known that 5, 000 Glorious Lion Knights could rival 50, 000 regular soldiers, and apart from these 5,000 soldiers, the allied forces still had over 100,000 soldiers from other troops!

The guards at General Mark’s side amounted to only 20, 000 people, and he lost half of them from the first battle. Yet, there were ten times more enemies standing right before their eyes now!

The death bell seemed to be looming over the guards’ heads and was ready to ring for their deaths anytime.

“Archers, prepare!” General Mark suppressed his fear and shouted loudly.

With his command, thousands of archers pulled their bows, and arrows flew toward the allied forces’ camp as General Mark raised his hand.

No matter what, they must give it their all!

“Why are they not defending?” A guard who just shot an arrow was rather surprised when he saw that the allied forces did not take any defensive actions despite thousands of arrows being shot at them. It was as though they completely did not see the arrows.

General Mark frowned slightly as well as he was not clear about the allied forces’ situation.

But just as confusion clouded the guards, five black beams suddenly shot out from the Glorious Lion Knights’ camp. When the arrows reached the front of the allied forces, the five beams formed a gigantic black screen under the moonlight!

All the arrows turned into dust instantly upon contact with the black screen!

“That is... black magic?! There are actually black witches hidden among the Glorious Lion Knights?!” General Mark’s eyes sharpened. Only then did he realize that there were five people donned in black robes among the Glorious Lion Knights. Those people had very small frames and were concealed in the troops. If one did not look carefully, they simply could not spot those people in the night.

The words “black magic” loomed above everyone’s head like a nightmare.

No one expected that the allied forces actually accepted the servants of the devil!

If the guards were almost on the brink of a breakdown by the enemy’s numbers, the appearance of the five black witches was the last straw that broke the camel’s back.

Everyone seemed to have seen their own corpses on the ground.

It’s over. They’re completely hopeless. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Hundreds of thousands of soldiers, Glorious Lion Knights, black witches... How terrifying their opponents were in this battle.

Even General Mark’s complexion turned white.

“Don’t be afraid! We are soldiers of the Supreme League Kingdom! We will protect our homeland with our lives!” General Mark shouted in a low tone in hopes of dispersing the fear among the army.

However, the seeds of uneasiness had already spread silently.

“Those are black witches. They possess black magic... How... How can we possibly be their opponent...”
