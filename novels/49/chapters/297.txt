In the metal cage was a giant lion, which was moving about in the cage irritably. Under the light, its golden fur was exceptionally dazzling. Its four strong paws revealed sharp claws which could easily tear everything apart.

“Ji Xianyuan, this is the Scorching Sun Lion cub that you ordered,” the warden said to Ji Xianyuan.

All the disciples were dumbfounded. The Scorching Sun Lion was famous for its ferocity and had extremely high combat ability. The Scorching Sun Lion in the metal cage was near two meters tall and three meters long, giving off a majestic appearance. However, this was still a cub. A grown Scorching Sun Lion had a body as large as a small hill, and its bite was powerful enough to break a thick slab of steal.

Ordinary disciples could barely take a glimpse of the Scorching Sun Lion, much less catch one as a spirit pet.

Yet, unexpectedly…

Ji Xianyuan actually exchanged one in the Xuanming Pavilion.

“This Scorching Sun Lion cub is seriously so majestic. If I get one, my future missions would be way easier to handle.”

“You want to get one? Do you know how many Xuanming points are needed to exchange for that Scorching Sun Lion cub? The price starts from ten thousand! Just drop the idea already.”

“Starts from ten thousand!” The disciples were startled by this shocking number.

For outer sect disciples like them, the number of Xuanming points they obtained from missions were already insufficient for their usual usage. How could they save up thousands of Xuanming points!

“Senior Brother Ji actually has so many Xuanming points? I’ve been in the sect for three years, and all my Xuanming points added up isn’t even this much.”

“That is Senior Brother Ji, the first in the outer sect, who is even on par with some inner sect disciples. He can kill the first hundred villains on the Assassination Roll by himself. How can you compare to him?”

The disciples were extremely envious and drooled at the majestic Scorching Sun Lion cub.

There were no emotions on Ji Xianyuan’s face as he received the Scorching Sun Lion cub after taking a look at it.

After obtaining the spirit pet, Ji Xianyuan had no intention of staying any longer and gave Dai Changming a look. Dai Changming immediately said to Ye Qingtang, “Junior Sister Ye, we will head back first.”

Ye Qingtang nodded as she glanced at the Scorching Sun Lion cub. A few years later, this Scorching Sun Lion cub was raised by Ji Xianyuan to be extremely fierce, and it even had a ranking in the inner sect. However, such a spirit pet which exhausted one’s Xuanming points was not what ordinary disciples could exchange for. As the top of the ranking chart, Ji Xianyuan’s abilities were naturally not to be underestimated.

Ji Xianyuan and Dai Changming led the Scorching Sun Lion cub out of Xuanming Pavilion, and the onlooking disciples finally dispersed. Though they were very envious, they were well aware that they had no fate with this baby worth over ten thousand Xuanming points.

Ye Qingtang walked to the weapon area alone.

There were many weapons displayed at the weapon area. From swords and bludgeons to bows and spears, everything was here.

Ye Qingtang scanned through the weapons. When the warden saw Ye Qingtang and noticed her face, his eyes twinkled. This morning, there was news from the inner sect that a new disciple from the outer sect obtained a generous amount of Xuanming points, and a portrait of that disciple was sent over as well.

Was it not just this lady before his eyes?DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎
