Chapter 50: assassination (4)

Ye Qingtang spoke with a genuine smile, “Of course, I’m well aware of your organization’s creed and I respect you all for that. That’s why your kind assistance will mean a lot to us. Once the Great Elder’s gone and my father regains his authority in our household, you all can rest assured we’ll return the favor that no amount of gold is enough to buy.”

The men were momentarily stunned by her words.

Like other noble families, there were bound to be underlying factors behind the Ye Household’s success. Tens of thousands of gold might indeed be a paltry sum when compared to the family’s assets.

Their deal with the Great Elder could be considered a one-off gain. But, if they were to accept Ye Qingtang’s offer, not only could they get their hands on a lot more gold, the Ye household would owe them a lifetime favor that they could profit for good!

Her offer had quickly struck a favorable cord with the men’s pragmatic common sense. Now, their eyes showed not a shade of menace but geniality instead.

“We catch your drift, Miss Ye and we accept your offer! No worries, we’re firmly resolved to fulfill your request.” The men’s murderous intent was like a fleeting shadow; from this moment, they behaved more like attendants than assassins.

“I knew I could count on you guys. We’ll never forget this favor.” Ye Qingtang thanked1 the men with a smile.

“Off we go then, and off with the Great Elder’s head!” With that said, the men bid their valedictions and set off for their new target: the malicious and sinister Great Elder!

When those men left, Ye Ling finally broke the silence whilst he stood quietly beside her all this time.

“Tang Tang, how did you…. ” Ye Ling was totally confounded by his own daughter. He was certain they were at death’s door just a while ago, but now, Ye Qingtang had not only averted that, she had even managed to turn the tables on the Great Elder.

“No worries, father. I’ll make sure no one lays a finger on you.” Seeing that her father was safe and sound, Ye Qingtang could finally let go of her past regret.

“I knew the Great Elder’s was a treacherous scum when he sought to undermine my position. But to think he would actually stoop so low to hire assassins….” Ye Ling knitted his brow from having faced this unprecedented predicament.

“Father, the Great Elder knows neither mercy nor honor when it comes to fulfilling his ambitions. He feared you might join hands with second uncle upon his return to foil his plans. That’s why he tried to remove you before that.” Ye Qingtang stated matter-of-factly.

Ye Ling heaved a heavy sigh as he shook his head, “Those assassins from the Qin Luo’s Pavilion, and the Great Elder himself is a force to be reckoned with. There’s also his loyal guards. I’m afraid we…..”

Before Ye Ling could finish his words, he was interrupted by a sudden clamor from the front courtyard and a smell of blood that wafted through the air.

Ye Ling and Ye Qingtang exchanged glances, before they made haste to the front courtyard. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

That clamor came from the nearby courtyard at where the Great Elder resided and within that, corpses were littered about. Those belonged to the guards on duty within that premises and they were long dead.

“To be able to take out that many guards around the Great Elder in such a short time. I must say those assassins from Qin Luo’s Pavilion are well worth their salt.” The situation had gotten increasingly alarming for Ye Ling. If Ye Qingtang had not intervened in the nick of time, he would be one of those corpses lying in a pool of blood.

Ye Qingtang did not comment on the situation, but when she was about to step into the courtyard with Ye Ling, she caught a glimpse of the Great Elder escaping beyond the walls with his tail between his legs. His purser who intended to give chase stopped in his tracks quietly when he noticed Ye Qingtang’s presence.
