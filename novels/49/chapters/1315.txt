1316 Impeachment 3

The Eternal Emperor’s expression was now very unpleasant. He immediately commanded men to take the city officials away and interrogate them under torture.

In a short while, the city officials who could not withstand the torture confessed that they had taken bribes from Ling Yan, which was why they had helped Ling Yan maintain his false front.

The Eternal Emperor was enraged the moment this emerged.

“Ling Yan! Is this your doing?” The Eternal Emperor shouted coldly. He looked at Ling Yan in anger and frustration.

But Ling Yan faced the enraged Emperor with complete composure.

“Royal Father! The Crown Prince was still young when he went to perform disaster relief. Perhaps he has made mistakes, but Royal Father, please take into account his youth and ignorance at that time and forgive him this once.” The Eldest Prince suddenly advanced and kneeled before the Eternal Emperor to plead loudly on Ling Yan’s behalf.

Ye Qingtang secretly smirked when she saw the Eldest Prince’s act of brotherly affection.

This Eldest Prince was pretty smart.

On the surface, he was pleading on behalf of Ling Yan, but in reality, he was affirming that Ling Yan was guilty of appropriating the disaster relief funds and deceiving the Emperor.

This was a great show. One act followed another, each aimed at Ling Yan’s life.

Ye Qingtang was engrossed in the show when she suddenly noticed that Ling Yan, who was standing in front of her, seemed to accidentally glance at her.

Perhaps it was her guilty conscience, but she felt that Ling Yan had discovered that she was present. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Surely that was not…

Ye Qingtang subconsciously felt the rough skin of her disguise and fingered her wispy beard to reassure herself.

But before the Eternal Emperor could speak again, the guards who had left the palace to arrest the others returned. They brought with them Mo You, Wu Liang, and the others who had left the Board of Punishments.

They had even brought Mo Yunxian, who had yet to recover from her injuries.

“Let me go.” Mo Yunxian was a little hurt by their grip and frowned unhappily.

Mo You and the others were brought into the great hall. They sensed that something was amiss when the Eternal Emperor’s personal bodyguards had arrived at their doorstep to arrest them. Now, they became exceedingly alarmed by the strange atmosphere in the court.

Mo You wanted to urge Mo Yunxian to speak carefully, but he was being guarded and had no chance to speak.

Everyone kneeled in the hall.

Mo Yunxian’s expression was very ugly. Many of her injuries had worsened after she left the Board of Punishments, and she had remained in her residence for many days to recuperate. As a result, she had not been able to see Ling Yan.

Now, she looked pleased to suddenly see Ling Yan in the hall. She did not know what was going on, but she subconsciously turned to Ling Yan and spoke.

“Elder Brother Yan…”

Ling Yan’s gaze did not move at all. It was as if he had not heard or seen Mo Yunxian.

Ye Qingtang could not help but secretly shake her head at this spoiled Miss Mo.

Mo Yunxian must have been spoiled rotten by General Mo. Now that she was in court, she showed no respect for the Emperor, calling Ling Yan’s name instead…

Perhaps Ming Gu’s blow had made her stupid?

When Ye Qingtang saw that everyone was gathered in the hall, she involuntarily glanced at Ling Yan.

He was the one who had permitted her to advise the Eldest Prince. Now, he would have to rely on himself to extricate himself from this difficulty.

Perhaps Ye Qingtang’s gaze lingered for too long. Ling Yan calmly turned his head, and his gaze passed over Mo You and the others, who were kneeling in the great hall. But when his gaze passed over Ye Qingtang, it seemed to linger for a moment. His expression seemed to hold a discreet smile.

“…” Ye Qingtang was speechless.
