“Boss, you wouldn’t not come back, right…” Yun Chen asked.

“Boss, I’ll go with you wherever you go.” Mu Ziying did not want Ye Qing to leave.

Qin Feng stood aside and looked at Ye Qing without saying anything.

“Stay in the academy obediently. I’ll come back after I’m done,” Ye Qingtang said to her students.

“Boss is leaving because he has something to do. Moreover, Boss already said that he’ll return once he’s done.” Qin Feng finally spoke.

Ye Qingtang smiled and looked at Qin Feng. “When I am not around, you will be their leader. Qin Feng, protect your junior brothers and sisters well.”

Qin Feng quietly clenched his fists as he spoke with a firm gaze. “Boss, I will.”

Before long, Ye Qingtang bid farewell to everyone. She only looked away when she saw everyone had left.

...

“Holy Lady, what’s going on… why didn’t you follow them to the academy?” The Blood Moon Elder looked at Ye Qingtang in confusion.

After all, it was an academy in the Second Domain, much higher in status than those in the First Domain. It was a rare opportunity for the Vice-President to let him be a teacher there. Wouldn’t that be a good situation…

Ye Qingtang glanced at the Blood Moon Elder. “Do you wish to die?”

The Blood Moon Elder was stunned. “Holy Lady, will I die if I become a teacher?”

Before Ye Qingtang could speak, the big yellow dog glanced at the Blood Moon Elder and said, “It’s not that you will die if you become a teacher. You will die if you stay in the academy.”

“Brother Canine, can you explain further?” The Blood Moon Elder asked.

“In that place before this… your so-called Wailing Well, didn’t you hear those old men say that this little girl seems to be from some academy? If they investigate along that thread, there’s no way we can escape.” The big yellow dog explained while wagging its tail.

Ye Qingtang glanced at the big yellow dog. It had to be said that this dog’s intelligence was indeed much higher than the Blood Moon Elder’s. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Holy Lady, is that true?” The Blood Moon Elder asked Ye Qingtang for confirmation.

“What do you think?” Ye Qingtang sighed.

“Then, will the academy be at risk…” The Blood Moon Elder frowned slightly.

Ye Qingtang was stunned.

Was this the Blood Moon Elder she knew? He was actually concerned about an academy which he had no links to… Did his character change after being resurrected?

“If the academy is destroyed, where can I go to be a teacher in the future? Sigh.” The Blood Moon Elder continued.

Ye Qingtang, “…” That’s right, she had misunderstood just now.

“This matter has already alarmed the Academy Alliance. The mysterious resurrected person is still very weak and will definitely not risk alerting the Academy Alliance. Therefore, the academy will not be in any danger,” Ye Qingtang explained to the Blood Moon Elder.

If Ye Qingtang guessed correctly, that person was interested in her Divine Concealment Spell and not the academy. The academy would be safer if she was not there.

“Little girl, where are you going now… why don’t we travel together? I’m not very familiar with this place..” The big yellow dog wagged its tail at Ye Qingtang.
