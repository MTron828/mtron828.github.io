Chapter 2206: Heaven Fire Elixir (2)

Nangong Lie also frowned. Qin Xuan was clearly belittling them.

“Don’t worry, I only came here to chat with Brother Feng,” Qin Xuan said in a condescending manner. He had absolutely zero regard for Lei Yan and the rest.

Nangong Lie glanced at Qin Xuan and chose to ignore him. Instead, he turned toward Qin Feng.

“Qin Feng, if you are done for the day, Boss wanted us to deliver this elixir to you.”

Nangong Lie was no fool. The gulf between their powers and Qin Xuan’s was very wide. If they came to blows, they would be the ones to lose. So he just chose to ignore him.

Qin Feng looked dubiously at Nangong Lie. Ye Qing had not bothered about him over the past few days, and he had been left alone in the garden.

Why did he suddenly send someone to deliver elixirs to him?

“Qin Feng, your teacher is pretty good to you, especially preparing elixirs for you. But... don’t you want to tell him that elixirs are completely ineffective on you? Ask him to save it and not waste those elixirs.” Qin Xuan smiled.

Ignore him, ignore him.

Nangong Lie quietly chanted in his heart, pretending not to hear the ridicule in Qin Xuan’s words. He grinned as he handed the bottle of elixir to Qin Feng.

Qin Xuan saw that Nangong Lie and the rest were purposely ignoring his existence. Luckily, he felt that he had enough of mocking Qing Feng for today, and so left with the other two teenagers in tow.

Qin Feng looked at the elixir. “What kind of elixir is this?” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Nangong Lie shook his head. “Boss didn’t say. He just asked us to hand them to you. Don’t worry. Any elixir given by Boss will definitely be suitable for you.”

Qin Feng: “...”

Why did Nangong Lie sound so optimistic?

Qin Feng didn’t care either way. He opened the bottle to look at the elixir inside.

But the moment he opened the bottle, a wonderful fragrance permeated the air. The fragrance was very calming as if it could soothe all of one’s energy and feelings.

Qin Feng was astonished at that fragrance.

This scent...

He found it rather familiar.

Qin Xuan, who had been prepared to leave, suddenly halted when he detected that fragrance.

“Qin Xuan, what’s the matter?” One of the teenagers beside him asked.

Qin Xuan frowned slightly, subtly sensing that fragrance.

“Heaven Fire Elixir?”

Qin Xuan had experienced this scent before.

It was when Qin Xuan and the rest were still children. The previous Clan Master of the Qin family was tormented by mental demons during his cultivation and nearly suffered from Qi Deviation. One of the elders at that time took out a pill called the Heaven Fire Elixir and had the Clan Master consume it. Only then were his mental demons subdued.

The Heaven Fire Elixir was very rare. The one in the Qin family’s possession, it was only because Qin Zhuo had chanced upon it. Since Qin Zhuo had gone missing, that Heaven Fire Elixir had become one of the most valuable heirlooms of the Qin family.

Qin Xuan had only seen it once. Thereafter, although he heard many legends regarding this Heaven Fire Elixir, he had never seen it again. Even within the Netherworld Academy’s Treasure Pavilion, he did not see such an elixir.

The Qin family’s bloodline was prone to mental demons. This was why elixirs that could resolve mental demons, like the Heaven Fire Elixir, were exceptionally important to the Qin family.

Qin Xuan had tried his best to get another one of those elixirs, but his efforts had been in vain. Smelling that familiar fragrance again, Qin Xuan couldn’t help being stunned.
