Chapter 2098: The Disintegrating Seal (2)

“She is so similar to the Holy Lord that even I cannot tell the difference between them. Her age and the extra three hundred years’ worth of memories are extremely strange. You all saw for yourself just now as well, that she could leave this place of her own accord. How could she have done that if she was completely unrelated to the Holy Lord?”

The fox-faced man’s words made the Elders start pondering.

“This temple was built by the Holy Lord, who used the power of space to open the space door and create this dimension. You should all be clear that no one can enter this place without the Holy Lord’s permission. The only reason we can come and go as we please is because we wear the rings containing the Holy Lord’s word...” Elder Hua seemed to agree with the fox-faced man. She lifted her right hand to look at the bronze ring on her finger.

Elder Bai and the fox-faced man both had this ring. The Elders who had yet to show themselves all had rings as well. They could only move in and out of the space that the Holy Lord had created when they were wearing the rings.

Outsiders sound only step foot in the place if they brought them in personally.

“I already thought that it was weird when the girl walked out. The Holy Lord said before that other than people who have already mastered the power of space, no one else would be able to enter the space that she created.”

“In all these years, have you ever seen someone with the power of space other than the Holy Lord? If she really does have some connection to the Holy Lord, don’t you think that this is all too coincidental?”

The Elder all started discussing among themselves whether Ye Qingtang really was the Holy Lord’s reincarnation.

Indeed it was not possible for them to confirm this in such a short frame of time. As such, they all agreed with the fox-faced man’s plan to get Ye Qingtang to stay in the Temple of Paragon in the meantime so they could observe her.

As the Temple of Paragon was discussing Ye Qingtang identity, she arrived at her room and found somewhere to sit down.

She instinctively turned to the little white tiger to tell it about her day but realized that her side was empty when she looked over.

“I forgot... the little tiger was locked in the Temple of Shadows by me.” Ye Qingtang twisted her lips. She wasn’t used to being alone since she was used to having the little white tiger by her side to listen to her.

“I wonder if Little You Yun has woken up...” She sighed softly. Fortunately, the Ancient You Clan had been exterminated and the Central Mainland wasn’t in danger anymore.

The Ancient You Clan had been extremely secretive with Little You Yun, which meant that the other tribes didn’t know of her existence and she was safe.

As soon as she spoke, she suddenly felt a chill on her chest. It felt as though something was rubbing against her chest through her clothes.

She froze and opened up her jacket to take a look.

A little creature as thick as her thumb was nestled nicely, fast asleep at her chest. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Little lightning dragon?” Her eyes widened as she looked at the little lightning dragon which she hadn’t seen in a while. Her lips curved up into a smile.

The little lightning dragon was back?

When all the living creatures of the First Mainland had been devoured by Little You Yun, the little lightning dragon had not been so lucky.

But now, the little lightning dragon had appeared again...

Ye Qingtang suddenly had the thought that since the Ancient You Clan had been destroyed, Elder Yuan who had been controlling Little You Yun and Little Luo Xue was probably as dead as a doornail.
