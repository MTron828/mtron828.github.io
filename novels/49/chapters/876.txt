Chapter 877 A Striking Plan

“So, what do you want to say?” Ling Yan finally spoke after a long time.

Master Du shook his head and said, “Nothing. I just feel that… The Demon God’s soul was gone long ago. Based on your intelligence, can you figure out where his soul and mind are now?”

“Everything is based on your assumptions now, right?” Ling Yan smiled and said.

“Right. Those are all my assumptions, and I think I can continue to presume. Ling Yan, do you think that the Demon God knew about his death tribulation from the Heavenly Emperor and pulled his heart and soul out of the body using his demonic intelligence? He then became another person and left his martial talents and ability in that body… The death tribulation would only look for that body. No one could ever imagine that the Demon God’s soul and heart would be reborn in a normal human, who would carry the Demon God’s memory. He hid in the dark to fight against the heavens and his destiny…” Master Du said.

“Hehe… You have a wild imagination. So, based on what you have said, the Demon God not only schemed his destiny but also himself.” Ling Yan chuckled and said. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“That’s right. The Demon God did not absorb his own power and left the body as the Heavenly Dao might discover his plan. If my assumptions were correct, I have to say that I really admire him… The Demon God abandoned his martial talent and ability and became a useless person who could not cultivate after he was reborn… Just like you.” Master Du said.

“So, you’re saying that I’m useless.” Ling Yan replied, but he did not seem to be offended.

“Haha, Ling Yan, I’m just telling the truth. Based on your martial ability, any cultivator from the Central Mainland can kill you easily,” Master Du said.

Before Ling Yan continued to talk, Master Du suddenly stared at Ling Yan seriously and said, “Ling Yan, even if you’re given the power that can turn over the entire world, you will not accept it. Besides lacking martial talent, you’re afraid that destiny may sense your presence… You’re the true Demon God, and Han Cangming was just a body. He does not have much thinking, no emotions, and he can only execute actions based on right or wrong… Even the name Han Cangming belongs to you, right?”

Master Du did not give Ling Yan any chance to reply as he continued. “The Demon God knew something from the Heavenly Emperor, and he started to plan and scheme everything using his one and only demonic intelligence. He even treated himself as the chess piece just to trick his destiny. He pulled out his soul and heart and was reborn with entire memory, Eventually, he became the third prince of the Eternal Dynasty. The name Han Cangming was the past tense. He was reborn as Ling Yan now… However, his body continued to live in this world with the identity as the Demon God. No one knows that the Demon God now does not have feelings, emotions, and thoughts. He can only live with instincts. The real Demon God manages to trick everyone with his intelligence and plans everything in the darkness… Everything is under his control.”

After a long time, Ling Yan smiled and said, “Interesting. It seems like it’s true that the dragon’s intelligence is above everyone else. I almost believed your story as well.”
