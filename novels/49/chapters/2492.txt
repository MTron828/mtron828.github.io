Ye Qingtang finally understood what the big yellow dog meant when it said whether it needed to leave.

Was it really just a dog? What a cheeky imp! T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Since it was a dog, it should be a good dog. What kind of dirty things were in its mind…

“Holy Lady, is this a dog?” The Blood Moon Elder could no longer suppress his curiosity and asked Ye Qingtang.

“What do you think?” Ye Qingtang asked the Blood Moon Elder.

Upon hearing that, Blood Moon Elder went forward and picked up the big yellow dog. He examined it carefully and muttered, “This… is really a dog. There’s nothing special about it and it’s not a demon or demonic beast.”

The more the Blood Moon Elder examined it, the stranger he found it. He had seen dogs before but he had never heard of dogs speaking.

“This guy looks disgusting.” The yellow dog was held in midair by the Blood Moon Elder. Without giving the Blood Moon Elder any time to react, it peed on his body.

“You dog!” The Blood Moon Elder tossed the big yellow dog aside.

“I really am a dog. Is that a problem?” The big yellow dog wagged its tail provocatively.

The Blood Moon Elder asked, “Holy Lady, what kind of demonic creature is this?”

Ye Qingtang glanced at the Blood Moon Elder. “Isn’t it just a dog?”

The Blood Moon Elder, “…” Was this really just a dog?! He had never seen such a strange dog.

But even if it was a dog, why did it have to pee on him?

“Among humans, your looks are considered quite unique,” the big yellow dog said to Blood Moon Elder.

The Blood Moon Elder glared at the big yellow dog fiercely. Since when did dogs start judging people by their appearance? Moreover, although he was not considered handsome, he was tall, powerful and full of charisma. What could a dog know?

“I’m ugly?”

The Blood Moon Elder instinctively looked at the ancient bronze mirror in Ye Qingtang’s room.

The Blood Moon Elder was stunned by the sight.

A middle-aged man appeared in the ancient bronze mirror. He had a wretched appearance and a mole on the left side of his face. There was a strand of hair on the mole and his eyelids were obviously drooping.

What the hell was this? How could the person in the mirror be even considered a human?

“This is me?!” The Blood Moon Elder’s pupils constricted as though he could not accept such a cruel reality.

He clearly remembered that he possessed the body of Elder Yin of the Ancient You Clan in the First Mainland. Although that body was not considered handsome, it was at least considered tall, mighty and domineering. What was he now?

“How is it? I chose it for you.” Ye Qingtang looked at the Blood Moon Elder and laughed softly. She was very satisfied with the body she chose.

“Ah? Holy Lady, what exactly happened? Why can’t I remember anything? Where are we now?” The Blood Moon Elder asked.

“You were killed by the Ancient You Clan in the First Mainland but I preserved your soul. Coincidentally, Zang has the ability to revive your soul so I helped you choose a vessel and you were reborn.” Ye Qingtang explained everything to the Blood Moon Elder.

The Blood Moon Elder was shocked. He actually… died a long time ago and was resurrected by the Holy Lady…

No wonder that handsome man kept on talking about death and resurrection.

The Blood Moon Elder originally thought that the Yongle Tribe General was speaking nonsense but now that he heard it from Ye Qingtang herself, how could it be false?
