“Ancestor, is what you said true? I have the chance to enter the Realm of Ascension too?” The Yongle Tribe General was in disbelief.

“Why? You don’t believe me?” Ye Qingtang glanced at the general. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“No… it’s not that I don’t believe you, but I don’t believe in myself…” The Yongle Tribe General smiled bitterly.

That was where all the Ancestors were located. How could he possibly step into the Realm of Ascension?

“No need to be anxious. When the time is ripe, I will naturally bring you there to take a look. However, the most important thing now is to help me revive this soul,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Yes!”

With Ye Qingtang’s promise, even though the Yongle Tribe General knew that it was unrealistic, he was still very excited.

Very quickly, the Yongle Tribe General took the gourd from Ye Qingtang’s hand. After examining the gourd carefully, he could not help sighing. It was another divine artifact. This small gourd could actually contain souls. It was really unbelievable.

After a few deep breaths, the Yongle Tribe General opened the gourd.

In an instant, a nearly ethereal purple fog seeped out. It was about to dissipate.

However, a cold mist shot out from the Yongle Tribe General’s eyes and froze the purple mist. He then slowly led the purple mist into the container.

Although the steps were simple, they took quite a bit of time. The Yongle Tribe General was already drenched in sweat before he was halfway through.

From this, it could be seen that it was not easy for the Yongle Tribe General to execute his divine skill. He had to focus all his attention and maintain a high level of concentration at all times. If he relaxed even a little, it was very likely that he would fail and his soul would dissipate.

About four hours later.

“Ancestor, it’s done. The soul you’ve stored has been imbued into the new vessel.” The Yongle Tribe General said, panting as sweat drenched all over his body.

“Not bad. I’ll remember your great contribution.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

However, this new vessel did not seem to have changed much…

“Zang. How many times have you used this divine ability?” Ye Qingtang asked curiously.

“Ancestor, to be honest, this is the fourth time,” the Yongle Tribe General replied.

“All of them succeeded?” Ye Qingtang was surprised. It was not an exaggeration to say that such a divine ability was heaven-defying. What kind of concept was it to revive the dead?!

“No, this is the first time I’ve succeeded. I’ve failed the previous three times. Perhaps my luck is bad.” The Yongle Tribe General pondered for a moment before replying.

Ye Qingtang, “…” Bad… bad luck?

The corners of Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched. It seemed that she was really very lucky. She almost caused the Blood Moon Elder to vanish into thin air. If the process had failed, the Blood Moon Elder’s soul would have dispersed and she would not have another chance to revive him in the future.

At this moment, Ye Qingtang finally realized that this Yongle Tribe General was actually… a complete fraud!

If he had said so earlier, she would definitely not have handed over the Blood Moon Elder’s soul so easily. It was a gamble… Furthermore, from the looks of it, the chances of winning were very low…

He had used his divine skill four times, and the first three times had all ended in failure. What kind of lousy success rate was that?

Just as Ye Qingtang was deep in thought, the middle-aged man who was lying on the ground suddenly widened his eyes in anger and shouted angrily, “The Holy Lady said… with me around, you can forget about going over… over my dead body!”

With that, the middle-aged man leaped up and stared straight at the Yongle Tribe General, who was the closest to him.

“Die!”

Before Ye Qingtang could react, the middle-aged man threw a punch.

Bam!

His punch landed squarely on the Yongle Tribe General’s face.

The Yongle Tribe General stood there unmoving, with only a slight frown on his face.
