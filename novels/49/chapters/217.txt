Chapter 216: Burden? (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

There was an “odd” harmony in the bloody yard.

The skulls that were stacked up previously were now arranged neatly in a few lines on the ground. All of them were facing the same direction without any flaws. It seemed that countless corpses were buried underground, leaving only the skulls above the ground. Those pairs of empty eyes stared straight at the direction where Zhou Xuan came from.

The disciple who almost vomited previously was shocked by the scene. His legs trembled and almost fell to the ground.

“What the hell!”

Ye Qingtang, who was wiping off the dirt on her hand, raised her head when she heard the scream. There seemed to be a faint smile on her delicate face, and her eyes were half-closed, looking towards Zhou Xuan and the rest.

“My fellow Senior Brothers and Senior Sisters, how’s the investigation?” Ye Qingtang asked in a lazy voice. Her tone seemed to be filled with slight sarcasm.

Zhou Xuan was stunned when he saw Ye Qingtang standing there and smiling to him. She did not seem to be affected at all.

What was Ye Qingtang planning to do?

Was she really a fifteen-year-old young lady?

How could a young lady remain so calm in front of all the rotten skulls? If it was other normal people, they might be scared to death.

Besides Zhou Xuan, the other two disciples who were unhappy with Ye Qingtang now stared at her in horror.

Zhou Xuan suppressed his astonishment. He did not answer Ye Qingtang directly. Instead, he scanned through the skulls and said, “Junior Sister Ye, What is this for? The people of the Spirit Condensation Mountain Village died mysteriously. Even though you are still playful at your age, you should not play with the skulls of the dead people.”

Zhou Xuan sounded like he was trying to educate Ye Qingtang. However, he was actually criticizing her for not respecting the dead.

Ye Qingtang sneered. She bent down and picked up one skull.

Zhou Xuan sneered secretly after witnessing Ye Qingtang’s move, but he did not show anything on his face.

“Junior Sister Ye, that’s not appropriate,” He said and frowned.

He then looked towards the Apothecary and tried to apologize.

“My Junior Sister is still young and does not know her manners well. Please understand.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Spirit Condensation Mountain Village was a side force of the Xuanling Sect. Under any circumstances, disrespecting the dead was out of the manner.

The Apothecary was stunned, but he did not dare to blame a sect disciple. He could only shake his head.

Zhou Xuan then looked towards Ye Qingtang and commanded. “Junior Sister Ye, do not do such unreasonable things. We are here for an investigation, not to mess around. Put back the skulls now.”

Zhou Xuan’s command made the other two disciples dislike Ye Qingtang even more. They were surprised by Ye Qingtang’s courage, but disrespecting the dead was really inappropriate.

“Junior Sister Ye, Spirit Condensation Mountain Village is under our sect. Do not ruin our fame!” One of the disciples was displeased.

Ye Qingtang raised her eyebrows slightly. She smiled when she noticed how the rest were convinced by Zhou Xuan. She ignored Zhou Xuan’s cankered face and looked straight to the skull on her hand.

“The degree of the decay of these three hundred skulls here is very severe. However, there is no obvious wound besides normal decay.”
