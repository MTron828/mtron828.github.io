Chapter 1546 A Great Support 2

“Jiang Qin is my daughter. I have not taught her well and should be punished as well. Please, Domain Monarch Founder, have compassion on my daughter and let her off this once. I will certainly discipline her firmly in the future. If there is to be any punishment, I will bear it on behalf of my daughter.” The Domain Monarch spoke sincerely, pleading for Jiang Yu to show mercy.“Father...” Jiang Qin looked at the Domain Monarch with tears shimmering in her eyes. Her eyes were filled with terror.

Jiang Yu looked at the Domain Monarch kneeling before him. He had thought well of this new Domain Monarch when he had chosen the latter. Along the way, Ye Qingtang had told him about some of the Jiang Family’s matters.

And he knew that the Domain Monarch had done quite well.

“This time, I will not drive her from the Jiang Family for your sake. But she cannot escape punishment.” Jiang Yu said sternly.

“Domain Monarch Founder, thank you for your grace!” The Domain Monarch only secretly heaved a sigh of relief when he heard the Domain Monarch Founder’s words. The truth was that he had also been extremely angry that Jiang Qin had insulted the Domain Monarch Founder.

“Hmph.” Jiang Yu grunted coldly. His sharp eyes landed on Jiang Qin.

Jiang Qin broke out in a cold sweep when his eyes swept over her. She reverently lowered her head and did not dare to look at him anymore.

“In that case, she may remain in the Jiang Family. She is to be disciplined with one hundred strokes of the rod, then put in the Cliff of Reflection to reflect on her misdeeds,” Jiang Yu said calmly as he meted out Jiang Qin’s sentence.

The Cliff of Reflection was where the Jiang Family punished people. It was an extremely cold place. Unless the person who entered it was strong enough to resist its effect, they would be unable to use spirit energy to obtain warmth and would have to endure the extreme cold every day.

Furthermore...

Although Jiang Yu had allowed Jiang Qin to remain in the Jiang Family, if she really was beaten a hundred times with the rod and all hundred strokes were heavy ones, Jiang Qin would certainly suffer after being thrown into the Cliff of Reflection to repent.

Even worse was that...

Jiang Yu had said Jiang Qin was to be imprisoned in the Cliff of Reflection, but he had not stated the term of her sentence.

If Jiang Yu did not release Jiang Qin, she might spend her entire life in that cold and miserable place...

Everyone understood this, but no one dared to question his judgment.

Jiang Qin also understood that she was about to face punishment, but... she had no choice.

If she resisted, she would be driven out of the Jiang Family.

And her name would be erased from the Jiang Family...

“Thank you, Domain Monarch Founder...” The Domain Monarch was satisfied with this outcome. Even he felt that Jiang Qin should be punished for insulting the Domain Monarch Founder.

Jiang Yu waved his hand in dismissal. He clearly could not be bothered to bandy more words with him.

The Domain Monarch founders personally ordered Jiang Qin’s punishment by the rod to be carried out immediately. Elder Meng, the current Elder in charge of the Hall of the Justice, came to the hall to mete out the punishment.

Jiang Qin’s status in the Jiang Family was quite high, and the Domain Monarch favored her. Thus, everyone in the Jiang Family usually deferred to her.

But now, the Domain Monarch Founder had personally decided on this punishment, and it was to be carried out in front of everyone. The men from the Hall of Justice were too afraid to go easy on her.

A moment later, the heavy metal rod glimmered as it rose and fell, hitting Jiang Qin with a smacking noise.

Under Jiang Yu’s close watch, the men from the Hall of Justice exerted their full strength, and every stroke bit into the flesh.

After twenty strokes, Jiang Qin’s skin had split open, and her flesh had turned to pulp. The ground was stained with her blood, and her face was pallid. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Ye You, who was standing by the side, turned white with terror when she saw the previously arrogant Jiang Qin being beaten into a pulp...
