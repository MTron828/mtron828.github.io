Chapter 1544 I Am The Evidence 3

Everyone stood up from surprise once the Domain Monarch’s golden seal was out.

“This is... the Domain Monarch Founder’s golden seal?” The cabinet elder widened his eyes in disbelief as he looked at the golden seal, and then at Jiang Yu astonishingly.

When Jiang Yu left the Jiang Family, Jiang Qin and the others of this generation were not born yet. Naturally, they had never seen this Domain Monarch Founder before, much less Jiang Yu’s golden seal. They noticed that the golden seal was similar to the Domain Monarch’s but did not think much about it.

“Who are you trying to scare by taking such a thing out? Ha...” Jiang Qin scoffed. She was about to make a few more sarcastic comments, but the Domain Monarch, who had been silent all this time, suddenly raised his hand and gave Jiang Qin a tight slap.

Jiang Qin was stupefied by the Domain Monarch’s slap as she held her swollen face and looked at the enraged Domain Monarch in shock.

Even Ye You was startled and turned pale.

On the other hand, Jiang Shangyu’s eyes were filled with astonishment upon seeing that golden seal. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Only two Jiang Family Domain Monarch golden seals were produced: one was in the possession of the current Domain Monarch and the other with the Domain Monarch Founder, Jiang Yu...

No one could make an imitation of this golden seal!

“Father...” Jiang Qin looked at the Domain Monarch in shock.

However, the Domain Monarch suddenly stood up and glared at Jiang Qin furiously. “Scoundrel.”

Then, with everyone’s eyes on him, he walked straight forward, got on one knee, and paid respects to that toddler in a respectful manner. “Greetings, Domain Monarch Founder!”

“What!”

Everyone was stunned by the Domain Monarch’s greeting.

Soon after, Jiang Shangyu and the cabinet elder also walked forward and kneeled on a knee to that little toddler.

“Greetings, Domain Monarch Founder!”

As the people with the highest authority in the Jiang Family kneeled before the little toddler, everyone else was left in endless shock.

“I did not teach my daughter well. Please punish me, Domain Monarch Founder.” the Domain Monarch apologized humbly with a tight frown.

“Back when I passed the Domain Monarch position to you, I hoped that you could lead the Jiang Family and stabilize its status. I did not expect that this would be how you lead the Jiang Family. How extremely disappointing.” Jiang Yu squinted his eyes slightly as he looked at the senior members of the Jiang Family, who were all kneeling on the ground.

Before Jiang Yu left the Jiang Family, the current Domain Monarch was still rather young. Jiang Yu favored his endowment and thus trained him for a long time and passed the Domain Monarch position to him.

“I am guilty of failing to meet your expectations, Domain Monarch Founder,” the Domain Monarch said.

“Humph.” Jiang Yu scoffed and subsequently walked up to the Domain Monarch’s seat.

Jiang Qin, Jiang Shun, and the rest were completely dumbfounded. Never would they have thought that this two-or three-year-old looking toddler was actually the rumored Domain Monarch Founder of the Jiang Family!

Didn’t the Domain Monarch Founder already leave the Second Domain?

Why did he return suddenly? And... Why did he become like this?

Everyone was filled with astonishment but did not dare to speak before the Domain Monarch Founder. They merely treated it as a minimizing effect of a special cultivation technique that he used.

At this moment, no matter how unwilling Jiang Qin and the rest were to believe Jiang Yu’s identity, the Domain Monarch and other elders had verified this unbelievable fact.

All color was drained from Jiang Qin’s face in a second.

Extreme uneasiness crept into her heart.

What did she say just now?

She actually dared to say that the Domain Monarch Founder was Ye Qingtang’s illegitimate child... and an illegitimate bastard...

Just thinking of what she said just now, Jiang Qin felt her legs weaken, and she almost fainted from the overwhelming fear. How she wished she could go back in time and slap her past self.
