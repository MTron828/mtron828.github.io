Chapter 2258: Escape (4)

The woman watched as her prey was being dragged away, and that beautiful face instantly morphed into a heinous and demonic expression.

“Roar!!”

She opened her jaws wide, revealing sharp teeth. Springing out of the water, it instantly exposed her lower body to Qin Feng.

It was a rotting fishtail…

Half the scales had already rotted away and fused with the flesh.

Qin Feng instantly paled. After Ye Qingtang tossed him to the side, she shot a black flame out from her hand, driving the mermaid monster back into the water.

He fell to the floor in a daze. At this moment, he finally noticed that Lei Yan and the rest had also somehow walked to the edge of the river. And in the water in front of each of them was an exceptionally beautiful woman.

Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes. The black flame in her hand morphed into a fiery dragon, shooting straight toward those monsters. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The high heat from the flames broke off the melodious singing voices of those beautiful women. Ear-piercing shrieks echoed through the air as their lovely faces morphed into heinous expressions. With a splash, they plopped back into the water.

Lei Yan and the rest were still in a daze as Ye Qingtang dragged them all back.

Ye Qingtang lit a wall of fire around the edge of the water using her black flame. Endless monstrous shrieks could be heard from behind that wall.

“What… what was that?” Jing Ze collapsed to the floor, still in a daze. He had no idea what just happened. He just remembered seeing a beautiful face and that alluring singing voice.

“Are those mermaids?” Yun Chen asked.

He had heard legends of half-human, half-fish creatures amongst the Sea Clan.

But…

These mermaids appeared to be different from the legends.

“Yes and no. They used to be mermaids but now, they are just monsters which have been transformed by the demon energy of the fiendcelestial,” Ye Qingtang replied coldly.

These mermaids had already died. But because of the fiendcelestial’s lingering energy, as well as the power of this tomb, they were transformed into undead monsters.

Their voices were full of allure and anyone who heard them would be instantly seduced, slowly being pulled into the river to be forever trapped in the watery depths.

They would then become part of the tomb.

“Boss, should we take a detour then? These things are too horrifying.” Lei Yan just felt like crying. What kind of godforsaken place was this?

“There’s no other route. We have to go through this river,” Ye Qingtang said.

“But… but…”

Ye Qingtang didn’t say anything more. Taking out a rope, she tied them all together in a line.

“Close off your five senses and follow me into the water, I will take you across the river.” To leave this tomb, they would have to exit from the opening on the other side. There was no way they could avoid this river.

“Boss, aren’t you worried about being bewitched by those monsters?”

“Who do you think I am?”

Lei Yan was stunned.

Ye Qingtang smiled. “I am your Boss. Of course I will try my best to bring you all out of here safe and sound.”

The teenagers were slightly taken aback by Ye Qing’s words.

Since stepping into this tomb, they had been filled with fear and apprehension at everything they had witnessed. But Ye Qing’s words had immediately wiped away the unease in their hearts.

It was as though…

As long as he was around, all problems could be resolved.

After tying everyone properly, Ye Qingtang gave Mu Ziying an elixir. Suddenly, she heard a series of faint voices, and her face immediately darkened.
