Chapter 1977: Crimson League (1)

“Right in the Frost Abyss.”

The Frost Abyss was an extremely cold place. There were barely any people living there and only alien clans could tolerate the sub-zero freezing temperatures there.

Before alien clans appeared in the Central Mainland, there was barely anyone living there.

“Holy Lord, the Temple of Shadows was removed from the Crimson League because you forsook the Temple of Shadows. Since you’ve already come back, perhaps we could contact the Crimson League...” The Demon Tribe leader tested the waters.

The eight tribe leaders certainly wished for the Temple of Shadows to return to the Crimson League, but it all depended on Ye Qingtang’s wishes.

Ye Qingtang paused for a moment to think. “Prepare yourselves over the next few days, we’ll be heading to the Frost Abyss.”

Once Ye Qingtang said that the eight tribe leaders’ eyes lit up. The Holy Lord was finally going to get in touch with the Crimson League!

Ye Qingtang didn’t let anyone else know about her trip to the Frost Abyss. She instructed Ming Wang and Ming Wang to guard the Temple of Shadows, making sure to take note of the Ancient You Clan’s every move.

She took the Demon Tribe leader and the Goblin Tribe leader with her as they headed for the Frost Abyss.

Originally Ye Qingtang had planned to take Ling Yan with her in case anything happened, but when she was reminded of the dangers at the Frost Abyss and Ling Yan’s capabilities...

It would be best for him to remain at the Temple of Shadows.

Moreover, if Ling Yan stayed behind at the Temple of Shadows and the Ancient You Clan were to come, Ling Yan could immediately contact Ye Qingtang via the voice transmission stone.

After making sure everything was taken care of, Ye Qingtang took the two tribe leaders with her and headed for the Frost Abyss.

The Frost Abyss was quite a distance away from the Temple of Shadows. Ye Qingtang didn’t have much time left and could only rush over with the fastest speed possible.

The entire Zenith Heaven was consumed by the Ancient You Clan’s horrifying aura. The only place that was not affected was the Frost Abyss since it had a freezing climate and no humans around. It was a boundless icy zone, with white snow covering the place and cold wind blowing around.

Looking across, it was an entire piece of white scenery. The snow and the skies were all white it was hard to distinguish one from the other. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Ye Qingtang couldn’t help but be reminded of the mystic realm she entered previously. The mystic realm was a freezing place, exactly like this. However, as compared to the coldness of the Frozen Ice Fields, the coldness here didn’t seem to have any effects on Ye Qingtang at all.

This time, Ye Qingtang brought Little White Tiger out with her.

After some time, a huge ice mountain appeared on the boundless icy zone. There was a thick layer of ice on top of the mountain and the icy layer reflected the sun rays and the snowy ground. One wouldn’t be able to easily spot the existence of the ice mountain.

“Holy Lord, the Frost Abyss is behind that ice mountain,” the Demon Tribe leader said.

Ye Qingtang nodded. Though she had once heard of the Frost Abyss, she had never been there before. If not, she wouldn’t have needed the Demon Tribe leader and Goblin Tribe leader to be here with her.

After passing the ice mountain, only then Ye Qingtang saw that behind the ice mountain, there was a huge crack on the snowy ground. The ground seemed to have cracked open and cold air wouldn’t stop coming out from the crack. When she looked over, it seemed to be a bottomless pit and was pitch dark.

This was the Frost Abyss.

An extremely cold place that was cut off from the rest of the world.

Without any further thought, Ye Qingtang flew down from the crack. The deeper she went, the lower the surrounding temperature.
