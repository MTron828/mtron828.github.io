1459 Shameless 1

“Elder Brother, Mo Yi is unrepentant even now. Why bother to bandy words with her? Just cut off her head and avenge Yiming.” Jiang Qin fanned the flames.

Jiang Shun nodded slightly. The aura that surrounded him instantly grew.

Jiang Qin and Tuoba Yao were also prepared to attack.

Mo Yi looked at them frostily, and a chilly smile appeared on her lips. She turned her head slightly to look at Ye Qingtang and then raised her hand to smooth Ye Qingtang’s hair, which lay against her cheek.

“Tang Tang, this place is too filthy. Wait for me in the room.”

But Ye Qingtang shook her head. She knew Mo Yi was very powerful, but Jiang Qin and the others were no weaklings. She could not abandon Mo Yi now that they were ganging up on her.

“Mother, why don’t I fight together with you?”

Although they were not actually related by blood, Mo Yi had been good to her.

Mo Yi was startled, but then she laughed softly. “Very well, we will kill our enemies together. I’ll slaughter these people who bullied my Tang Tang.”

With that, Mo Yi’s gaze suddenly turned towards Jiang Qin and the others.

“If I survive today, all of you will die in the future.”

Mo Yi’s words were filled with powerful murderous intent. The two demon fox servants were at attention. Even the Beidou Demon Lord was prepared to fight. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Jiang Qin and the others were all Heavenly Venerates. Based on their current fighting abilities, it would be difficult for Ye Qingtang and the Beidou Demon Lord to participate in today’s battle.

But at that moment, no one was prepared to retreat.

The next instant, Jiang Qin and the others suddenly charged at Mo Yi. Mo Yi leaped into the air and met them in battle. Her two servants also entered the fight.

Ye Qingtang was not far behind. She took a few bottles of elixirs from her space ring that could temporarily increase her abilities and drank them. Then, she drew her sword and charged with the little white tiger and the Beidou Demon Lord.

Ye You and Ye Xun, who had followed Jiang Qin and the others, now stood at the entrance of the yard and watched the melee from a distance.

Ye You’s eyes passed over everyone and then settled on Ye Qingtang. Her eyes were filled with malice.

“Elder Sister You’er, Ye Qingtang is doomed. Mo Yi is certainly no match for Aunt Qin and the others when they join forces against her,” Ye Xun said with a smile.

Ye You’s lips curved in a faint smile. She had come here just to see Ye Qingtang lose her head.

In a moment, a series of pitched battles were taking place throughout the yard.

The two demon fox servants were fairly powerful, but they still paled in comparison to Jiang Qin and the others. Ye Qingtang and the Beidou Demon Lord joined forces with the two servants to hamper Jiang Qin and Tuoba Yao.

But Jiang Shun directly attacked Mo Yi.

Jiang Shun was much more powerful than Jiang Qin. He managed to hold his own as he traded blows with Mo Yi. For a while, things were at a stalemate, and it was difficult to determine who would win.

Ye Qingtang and a demon fox servant fought Jiang Qin. Jiang Qin was no match for Mo Yi but could manage the demon fox servant and Ye Qingtang.

The demon fox servant and Ye Qingtang joined forces but were still no match for Jiang Qin. After a while, the demon fox servant was struck by Jiang Qin and spat out a large mouthful of blood.

“Young mistress, you better go.” Traces of blood stained the demon fox servant’s robes red. Her voice did not waver, but she protected Ye Qingtang so that she could leave the battlefield.

Jiang Qin was much more powerful than she imagined. The young mistress’s powers just could not compare to Jiang Qin.

It did not matter if she died. But nothing must happen to the young mistress.

“Trying to escape? It’s not that easy.” Jiang Qin would not allow Ye Qingtang to leave. She leaped up and brushed past the demon fox servant, her palm descending on Ye Qingtang.
