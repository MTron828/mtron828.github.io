Chapter 1937: The Mastermind Behind It All (1)

“You still dare to resist?” Ming Di was enraged. How dare this fellow kill off its prey right?

A light flashed across the eyes of the grim-faced youth as he watched his partner draw his last breath. As Ming Di raged on, the youth suddenly dug his own hands into his chest and tore it apart.

He moved so quickly that Ye Qingtang could not react in time.

“Did he go mad?” The ancient clan leaders were all bewildered.

But the moment that youth tore open his own chest, a nearly imperceptible wisp of smoke suddenly flew out from his heart. The wisp of smoke moved very quickly and disappeared within the blink of an eye.

“Trying to escape?” Ming Di narrowed its eyes. Opening his jaws wide, he inhaled deeply.

With one powerful intake of breath, Ming Di sucked the dissipating smoke right into its belly.

Ye Qingtang wanted to stop him but could only stare on as Ming Di’s throat bobbed up and down.

Oh no, he already swallowed it!

“Stupid little bug.” Ming Di snorted coldly. Lifting its claws, it tossed the two limp corpses across the ground. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Ye Qingtang felt a headache coming on.

That grim-faced youth was clearly trying to eliminate his partner and escape, to prevent themselves from being interrogated.

Ming Di didn’t let him escape, but...

The youth still managed to achieve his goal.

“Go and check if there are any clues on their bodies.” Ye Qingtang suppressed the exasperation she was feeling.

This Ming Di was very powerful, but its character...

Could only be described by one word: Impulsive!

With the Undead Clan in tow, Ming Wang went forward to investigate the bodies of the two youths. They discovered some random Dharma artifacts and a fragment of the Spirit of Chaos in their space rings.

Ye Qingtang’s heart quivered when she accepted the Spirit of Chaos fragment from Ming Wang.

The Spirit of Chaos fragment was palm-sized and no different from any ordinary-looking black metal. But holding it in her hand, Ye Qingtang felt no weight at all. It was as if this fragment didn’t exist.

The ancient clan members felt very envious when they saw that Ye Qingtang had discovered a fragment of the Spirit of Chaos. It must be pointed out that each of the ancient clans owned just one fragment of the Spirit of Chaos, and everyone would wish to possess more pieces.

But at present...

The ancient clan members wisely kept quiet. They silently acquiesced to the fact that this fragment belonged to the Temple of Shadows.

After personally witnessing Ming Di’s power, no one would dare to make an enemy of the Temple of Shadows unless they were insane!

It was Ye Qingtang’s first time seeing the Spirit of Chaos. She had spent a long time trying to find the fragment belonging to the Holy Lord of Shadows but failed to locate it. Despite being very curious, Ye Qingtang had to pretend to be nonchalant. She just gave it a few casual looks before placing it into her space ring.

“Holy Lord, we couldn’t find any accessories on the bodies but we did find a sort of symbol.” Xue Fu stepped forward to report.

“Oh, what symbol?” Ye Qingtang asked.

Xue Fu had his men drag over the bodies of the youths. Both youths had a palm-sized circular symbol tattooed in the middle of their backs.

The symbol did not look familiar. Ye Qingtang had never seen such a symbol before.

“Do any of you recognize this symbol?” Ye Qingtang looked toward the ancient clan members and the eight tribe leaders.

The eight tribe leaders stepped forward to take a look. But they were likewise puzzled and shook their heads before retreating to the side.

The ancient clan members also took a look, but none of them had seen such a symbol before either.
