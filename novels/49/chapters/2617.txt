Ye Qingtang felt increasingly puzzled as she listened to the conversation between the Heavenly Emperor and Han Cangming. Were these two people speaking Greek? Why did she not understand what they were saying at all?

“Jiuyou, is there a deep grudge between the Heavenly Emperor and the Demon… and Han Cangming?” Ye Qingtang asked in confusion as her gaze landed on the young Feng Jiuyou.

Although there were many legends regarding the Heavenly Emperor and the Demon God Han Cangming in Ye Qingtang’s era, she had never heard of any feud between the two of them.

“Ah… Sister Ye Yue, I don’t know either!” The young Feng Jiuyou was stunned by Ye Qingtang’s question and shook his head.

Currently, the young Feng Jiuyou was just a youth from a small family clan. How would he know about any grudges the Heavenly Emperor had with Han Cangming?

However, at this moment, the Feng family patriarch stepped forward and stood beside Ye Qingtang. He looked at her and said, “Miss Ye, are you interested in the Heavenly Emperor and Han Cangming?”

Ye Qingtang smiled and said, “Patriarch, this is something to do with an Immortal Emperor level practitioner. It is natural for anyone to be curious, is it not?”

The Feng Family patriarch did not feel that there was anything wrong with Ye Qingtang’s explanation. Indeed, anyone would pay attention to any news regarding powerful figures at the level of Han Cangming and the Heavenly Emperor. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Actually, Miss Ye, to be honest, I do know some information but I’m not sure if it’s accurate. If you want to hear it, I’m willing to tell you,” the Feng family patriarch said.

Ye Qingtang nodded. “Thank you, Patriarch.”

“Miss Ye, you’re being too courteous. Miss Ye is the great benefactor of the Feng family. It’s just some gossip. There’s no need to thank me...” the Feng family’s patriarch looked very solemn. Ye Qingtang was a little speechless. The people of this era were so polite and proper...

“I’m all ears,” Ye Qingtang said with a smile.

“Miss Ye, according to the information I have heard... The Heavenly Emperor and Han Cangming used to have a very good relationship... There was even a period of time when they were inseparable through life and death,” the Feng family patriarch said slowly.

Ye Qingtang was stunned. Inseparable... through life and death?!

She looked up into the sky. How was this a life-and-death relationship? It was more like a fight to the death.

“It is said that the Heavenly Emperor obtained a fortuitous item that can allow him to ascend to the heavens,” the Feng family patriarch continued.

“Patriarch, there’s something I don’t understand. What does ascending to the heavens mean?” Ye Qingtang asked.

In the conversation between Han Cangming and the Heavenly Emperor just now, they had mentioned ascending to the heavens several times. That jade stone in Han Cangming’s hand was suffused with a white luster. It seemed to be an item that could let one ascend to the heavens.

“Miss Ye... this...” When he heard Ye Qingtang’s question, the Feng Family Head’s expression was slightly awkward.” To be honest, I don’t understand what it means either... perhaps it means improving one’s martial arts power or something like that. ”

“Wait...”

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly.

Could the heavenly ascension mentioned by the Heavenly Emperor and Han Cangming be....
