Chapter 1490 Worsening Matters 2

Ye Qingtang squinted her eyes slightly as she glanced across the Ancient You Clan troop. She realized that the elder she met the other time in the First Mainland was not present. However, her heart suddenly leaped.

The Ancient You Clan elder she met in the First Mainland was in the Heavenly Venerate realm, but now...

Casting a glance, Ye Qingtang realized that the thirty-plus Ancient You Clan elders that appeared in the Land of Infinite Demons were several times more powerful than that person...

It’s Little You Yun...

Ye Qingtang’s heart sank. After the Ancient You Clan obtained Little You Yun, their skills increased tremendously; however, the speed of this increase was far beyond her initial predictions.

The arrival of the Ancient You Clan attracted the attention of other forces as well. The Cloud Valley Clan and Southern Peak Clan, which crossed paths with the Jiang Family earlier on, also appeared here, and they were taken aback when they saw the Ancient You Clan elders.

They were clearly flabbergasted by the dramatic increase of Ancient You Clan’s skills.

“I heard that the Ancient You Clan was up to some things recently. So it’s their increase in skills... It seems that they’ve already used the Spiritual Abode they obtained from the First Mainland.” Jiang Xun scoffed, though it was not the time to look at Ancient You Clan right now.

Just as Jiang Xun was pondering, a loud voice suddenly rang.

“Ancient You Clan, I didn’t expect you all to be here today as well!” A figure suddenly walked out from the dense forest of the Land of Infinite Demons.

Donned in a long black robe, it was a fifteen or sixteen-year-old teen with close to a hundred people following behind him. His gaze turned cold immediately when he saw the Ancient You Clan troop in the sky.

“That is...” Ye Qingtang looked at that teen uncertainly as she vaguely felt a sense of familiarity.

Jiang Xun said softly, “That is Bai Lixi, one of the top geniuses of the younger generation in the Central Mainland. He may only be sixteen years old, but he is already at the peak of the Heavenly Venerate. Given his endowment, he probably can advance to the Holy Venerate realm before twenty.”

A Holy Venerate before the age of twenty?

Surprise flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes. She stared at that youth again, and only then did she realize why he felt familiar.

In her previous life, Bai Lixi was one of the top ten Honor Roll geniuses in the Central Mainland alongside Beidou Demon Lord. Ye Qingtang met Bai Lixi once due to Beidou Demon Lord, but Bai Lixi was much older back then. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Anyone from the younger generation who could enter the Central Mainland’s Honor Roll List in her previous life was known to be extraordinarily talented.

Ye Qingtang needed three hundred years to enter the Holy Venerate realm, but Bai Lixi, at age sixteen, was only one step away from the Holy Venerate realm.

Bai Lixi seemed to have some enmity with the Ancient You Clan, but he did not act impulsively.

Such was actually the case with others as well. Many forces in the scene had some grudges against each other, but at this moment, all of the powerful figures seemed to have some sort of tacit understanding. Thus, no one made a move.

“Our objective is the same today, and it is not the time to be settling our private feuds right now. Seizing the Great Demon as quickly as possible is the key instead,” the Beast Master said suddenly after remaining silent all this while. As he spoke, his eyes specifically swept across the demon kings, Temple of Shadows, and forces of other alien races.
