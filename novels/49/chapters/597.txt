As if this laugh was infectious, in just a while, the numerous disciples who escaped from the second palace stood together and drew out their weapons with a crazed expression, similar to the Yuehua Sect Master previously.

Puff!

Puff!

Without saying anything, those people slaughtered many instantly.

Those who were killed were not on their guard and were thus slain in one strike.

In just a moment, blood spouted everywhere, and the intense smell of blood filled the air.

Everyone was alarmed to see the blinding patches of blood and hurriedly pulled a distance away from those ten or so people.

“What happened to them!” Someone questioned in shock.

“It’s the same as the Yuehua Sect Master just now!”

“Could it be that these people also went berserk?!”

Everyone looked at those ten over people, astonished.

“Everyone, hold your nose! Don’t breathe in the scent here!” Ye Qingtang reminded everyone immediately.

Although this scent was similar to Black Heaven Water’s, it was mixed with something different. Ye Qingtang thought that everyone’s berserk state was definitely related to the scent in this second palace, and it was highly possible that they lost their minds because of this scent!

Moreover, after observing their condition, it seemed that the stronger one’s skills were, the faster the scent would take effect. For example, that Yuehua Sect Master went crazy instantly while those people trapped with him were not as skilled as the Yuehua Sect Master and thus flared up later.

“Scumbag!” The Yunxiao Sect elder hollered angrily and looked at Ye Qingtang. “I already said not to open the giant steel door just now. If you had not let them out…”

Without waiting for him to finish his sentence, Ye Qingtang snickered coldly. “If I did not let them out and have an additional ten or so Martial Qi Level Three people, do you think we could’ve subdued the Yuehua Sect Master?”

“You…” The Yunxiao Sect elder glared angrily and wanted to speak but was stopped by Ye Qingtang. “If not for me, all of you would have been slain by the Yuehua Sect Master.”

As Ye Qingtang said that, those people charged towards the crowd with chortles. The scene fell into chaos once again.

Originally, these ten or so people were nothing to be fearful of, but an increasing number of super sect disciples went crazy after breathing in the strange smell and joined the camp of those people.

“This is bad…” Ye Qingtang frowned deeply. If this continued, everyone would probably die here.

“Leave!”

After ordering the Blood Moon Elder to leave, Ye Qingtang used her primordial qi which allowed her to boost her speed to the maximum as she ran forward.

The third palace was a thousand meters away.

Ye Qingtang’s the fastest. She opened the huge iron door in the blink of an eye and entered the third palace.

There was a giant stone statue of a lady in the third palace. The lady carved out of stone had stunning beauty and was almost lifelike in appearance. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

A small gold bottle stood quietly in her hands. That was also where the smell came from it.

“Black Heaven Water…”

Ye Qingtang’s expression changed slightly.

Her goal of entering the mystic realm from the very start was for the Black Heaven Water.

But after entering the Hundred Level Peril Hell of Avicinaraka, she no longer had any desire to search for the Black Heaven Water. Yet unexpectedly, the Black Heaven Water was actually in the hands of a stone statue in the third palace!

Ye Qingtang did not rashly retrieve the Black Heaven Water at the first moment but inspected the stone statue before her carefully instead.
