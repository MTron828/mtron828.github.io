Chapter 1570 Oh My 3

Clearly, You Qiong knew Xie Wushang as well.Jiang Yu was not the slightest bit interested in talking to You Qiong right now and immediately looked at Ye Qingtang.

“Bring me out of the valley immediately.”

“What?” Ye Qingtang was taken aback.

What is going on? 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Didn’t Jiang Yu say that he wanted to meet that Xie Wushang earlier on? Why does he want me to bring him out of the valley now?

Meet Xie Wushang?

Jiang Yu did not want to see her ever again in his life.

Jiang Yu was very dashing back in the days, and coupled with his martial talent, many girls fell for him. However, Jiang Yu was deeply in love with his wife and no longer looked at anyone else ever since he fell in love with her. Even if others liked him secretly, he never paid any attention to them.

Even after his wife passed, he was unable to put this love behind him—he instead entered the Land of Infinite Demons and kneeled for thousands of years to plead for his wife’s revival.

Many ladies were head over heels for him, but he had never looked at them. This Xie Wushang was also one of the people who adored Jiang Yu.

Jiang Yu could simply ignore the person if she was anyone else, but Xie Wushang was a powerful figure from the Second Domain. She was born with extremely great talent and had an arrogant nature. Ever since she met Jiang Yu, she could not forget about him. Regardless of whether Jiang Yu was married, she never gave up and pursued him all the way, tormenting Jiang Yu quite a fair bit.

Jiang Yu stayed in the Land of Infinite Demons for ten thousand years and originally thought that Xie Wushang had forgotten about him completely. Yet, unexpectedly...

He had just returned, and Xie Wushang actually got news of it and came over.

In the past, Jiang Yu could just spar with Xie Wushang when he met her to force her to retreat, but now...

“Don’t ask so much. Just bring me out of the valley secretly.” Jiang Yu looked at Ye Qingtang and spoke. He knew Xie Wushang—once they met, she would pester him endlessly.

Ye Qingtang did not know why Jiang Yu wanted to do this but could only follow his orders when she saw his expression.

“Follow me.” Jiang Yu looked at You Qiong and said.

You Qiong laid on the couch in an unperturbed manner and waved his hand lazily.

“For what? She’s here to find you. What has it got to do with me? I think you shouldn’t run either. You’ve run away for ten thousand years, and it is about enough. Xie Wushang is quite pretty, has a good figure, and is very talented. You should just yield to her...”

Jiang Yu almost kicked You Qiong to the ground. He could not be bothered to talk to You Qiong any further and immediately had Ye Qingtang sneak him out of the valley.

Ye Qingtang brought Jiang Yu and flew into the sky and out of the valley.

But before they could fly out of the valley, a red figure suddenly appeared before the two people.

Jiang Yu’s face darkened the moment he saw that blazing red figure.

“Jiang Yu, you’re thinking of running again!” Xie Wushang, who was floating in the air, squinted her eyes at Jiang Yu. While Jiang Yu was currently in the form of a child, she could clearly sense that it was none other than him given her martial realm.

A look of surprise flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes when she saw the gorgeous lady before her. Then, Ye Qingtang slowly landed on the ground with Jiang Yu.

Although she knew that Jiang Yu seemed to be avoiding this lady, they were spotted right now, and there was no other choice...

Elders and disciples rushed over hurriedly as well.

“Xie Wushang, I’ve already told you clearly that we are not fated. Don’t pester me anymore,” Jiang Yu said with a dark expression.

Xie Wushang’s eyes narrowed and suddenly swept across Ye Qingtang, who was beside Jiang Yu.
