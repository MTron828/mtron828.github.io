Chapter 1749: Fiendish Demon (2)

“Rip!”

“Qiu Chen’s” sharp claws ripped through the sack and pulled out the bloodied mess inside.

At this point, Ye Qingtang finally saw clearly what was inside that sack...

The sight nearly made her want to throw up.

It was a person who had been completely skinned. The person’s entire body was a mess of bright pink exposed flesh covered in fresh blood.

“Qiu Chen... brother... Qiu Chen... brother...”

That skinned person was being held in mid-air by “Qiu Chen’s” sharp claws. Fresh blood dripped down onto “Qiu Chen”, even as bloodied tears streamed down the person’s cheeks.

Those eyes. That familiar voice. Ye Qingtang was taken aback. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

It was... Qiu Ci...

Looking at the skinned Qiu Ci and then at the grinning “Qiu Ci”, Ye Qingtang could deduce what had happened to Qiu Ci and Qiu Chen.

Legend had it that fiendish demons loved to torture. They especially loved to torture humans, who were full of feelings and emotions. This was also why Ye Qingtang was so worried about being discovered.

Qiu Ci and Qiu Chen had probably accidentally stumbled into this mountain valley and were discovered by the fiendish demons. The two humans had been captured and skinned, and their skins were now being worn by the demons.

Ye Qingtang’s stomach churned.

“Stop acting dead. I want to continue playing.” The fiendish demon draped in Qiu Ci’s skin whined.

“They can’t die... they can never die...” The demon wearing Qiu Chen’s skin grinned an ear-splitting grin. He stared at the crying Qiu Ci, admiring her fearful and despairing expression as he slowly twisted his sharp claws deeper into her, grinding up her insides bit by bit.

To a fiendish demon, a human’s reaction to torture was the most wonderful thing in the world. So fearful, so easily breakable and powerless under their might...

Just as the two fiendish demons were enjoying themselves, several black figures suddenly darted out of the trees. They were a group of malevolent-looking fiendish demons. Noticing the two demons clad in human skin, they immediately howled.

Startled, the two fiendish demons emitted their own demonic cries.

It was clear that the new group of fiendish demons were not from the same camp as the first two. The bunch of them immediately engaged in a fierce battle.

The new group of fiendish demons were all extremely powerful and they outnumbered the first two. Within seconds, those two fiendish demons were slaughtered and the victors peeled off their human skins and kept them away. Thereafter, they immediately started feasting on the dead demons’ flesh.

After finishing their meal, they discovered the bloodied Qiu Ci by the waterfall. Skewering her with their sharp claws, they picked her up and left the place. In the end, all that was left by the waterfall was a pool of blood and the remains of those two fiendish demons.

Once she made sure that the fiendish demons had left, Ye Qingtang slowly stood up after making sure that the aura exuded by those demons had also faded away.

What she witnessed earlier turned her stomach inside out.

She didn’t know Qiu Ci well, but seeing a live human being played and tortured in this manner by the fiendish demons—the whole experience weighed so heavily on her that she found it hard to breathe.

It was obvious that the new group of fiendish demons would not be kind to Qiu Ci. It would be a new round of torture for her.
