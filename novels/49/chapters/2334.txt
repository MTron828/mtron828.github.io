Chapter 2335: Perfect Quality (1)

The elusive palm flame technique had been lost for many years. Ye Qing was just a youth in his 20s and a martial arts practitioner, and not even a high-level one at that. There was no way Zhu Ning would believe that such a person would know the palm flame technique.

“Teacher Zhu?” Di Nuo, who had been feeling very confident, suddenly noticed the strange look on Zhu Ning’s face.

Zhu Ning remained silent. Although he could see Yun Chen using a palm flame, he couldn’t be 100% sure it was that legendary technique. To confirm it, they would have to wait until Yun Chen completed his refinement.

After all…

An elixir refined using the palm flame method would possess unique characteristics.

At this point, Ye Qingtang was entirely focused on Yun Chen.

Yun Chen’s movements were very fast and he was using his palm flame to refine the elixir. All his movements and his entire process was being displayed in front of everyone.

Song Yanhan had already placed all his ingredients into the tripod and been refining for some time. He surveyed the arena and saw the anxious expressions on the faces of the other candidates. Their refinement techniques were also largely incorrect.

It was just as he had predicted. He was just undergoing today’s trial as a courtesy. With his abilities, no other student in the entire Netherworld Academy could compare with him.

Used to basking in the spotlight, Song Yanhan was expecting astonished and admiring gazes when he suddenly realized that none of the spectators were even looking at him.

In the next second, Song Yanhan’s brows were slightly furrowed. Used to being the center of attention, he found it very strange. He instinctively followed the eyes of the spectators.

Song Yanhan was dumbstruck by what he saw.

Yun Chen had a strong flame in his palm, which was gradually refining the prepped ingredients, slowly transforming them into an elixir pill.

This special refinement technique had attracted the attention of everyone. Even the candidates were also watching after having placed their own ingredients into their tripods. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“What is Yun Chen doing?”

“What is going on? What kind of technique is that?” The candidates all believed that Yun Chen was just showing off some fancy trick to divert attention from his lack of skill.

Song Yanhan was the only one whose expression underwent a major shift,

“Palm flame?”

As Zhu Ning’s disciple, of course he knew about the legendary elixir-refinement technique which his Master had always dreamed of.

But…

How did a useless piece of trash like Yun Chen know the palm flame technique?

There was no way Song Yanhan was willing to believe that Yun Chen really knew this technique.

Time passed by the minute and second. Yun Chen’s palm flame suddenly surged and grew stronger. The fire engulfed the ingredients and no one could see his progress.

“Damn… Boss, what is this special elixir-refinement technique? It looks very formidable…” Lei Yan widened his eyes. This was the first time he was seeing Yun Chen refine elixirs.

Previously in the Evil Soul Forest, Ye Qing only taught Yun Chen late at night when the rest of them were already snoring like pigs.

Ye Qingtang didn’t reply. She merely watched on as Yun Chen used his flame with a practiced hand, slowly refining his elixir pill.

Meanwhile, Gong Jinyun and his group were somewhat confused. They didn’t know much about alchemy and were at a loss about what was happening.

But…

Yun Chen’s elixir-refinement technique did look rather fancy. It would be some time before the Sky Spirit Jade Elixirs would be done.

Everyone was waiting in anticipation of the results.
