Chapter 2640 Saint Ye Yue (1)

“Cage prison…”

Ye Qingtang looked at the Heavenly Emperor in astonishment. The lower realm was actually a prison?

However, what did this cage represent? When did this cage first come about? Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Those who possess sufficient power will be able to ascend to the heavens and enter the upper realms and become a True God. However, the more True Gods enter the upper realm, the more unstable the world will become,” the Heavenly Emperor explained expressionlessly.

Ye Qingtang frowned in deep thought after hearing the Heavenly Emperor’s words. “So what you mean is that the upper realm does not want the living beings in the lower realm to be able to ascend to the heavens. This is why the Heavenly Tribulation exists.” “Perhaps.”

Actually, Ye Qingtang was only a little curious about what the Heavenly Emperor said. She did not really care that much if the lower realm was a cage prison.

This matter was too far-fetched an idea for Ye Qingtang.

After a long time, the Heavenly Emperor’s gaze landed on Ye Qingtang. “I will be leaving. However, I don’t like to owe others a favor. If there’s a chance in the future, I will repay you.”

With that, the Heavenly Emperor stood up slowly and disappeared before Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

Half a month later, somewhere on a mountain peak.

The Heavenly Emperor looked at the man in front of him and said coldly, “Hand it over.”

This man was none other than Han Cangming.

Han Cangming immediately took out a jade bead and threw it to the Heavenly Emperor without saying a word.

A hint of surprise appeared in the Heavenly Emperor’s eyes. He had chased after Han Cangming for half a year but he was unwilling to hand over the Heaven Ascension Pearl. He did not expect him to be so compliant this time. It was a little puzzling. “Do you find my actions unbelievable?” Han Cangming stared at the Heavenly Emperor and chuckled.

“I’m just curious. Why did you suddenly change your mind?” The Heavenly Emperor asked Han Cangming. Han Cangming did not answer the Heavenly Emperor’s question. He just smiled and said, “You want to ascend to the heavens, but you don’t know how long you can live a carefree life thereafter.”

“What do you mean?” The Heavenly Emperor asked expressionlessly.

“People dream of breaking out of the cage prison and ascending to the upper realm. Growing wings and becoming an immortal. Isn’t that laughable?” Han Cangming replied.

“There’s no need for you to worry about me.” The Heavenly Emperor stated calmly. “You seem different today.”

“Why do you say that?” Han Cangming smiled. “Just a feeling,” the Heavenly Emperor answered.

In the Heavenly Emperor’s mind, Han Cangming was extremely sinister and cunning. However, the Han Cangming in front of him gave him a different feeling.

Several years later.

Inside the Great Immortal Temple.

Several years had passed since Ye Qingtang came to this strange era but she still could not find a way to leave. “Sister Ye Yue!”

At the back of the mountain, Feng Wuyin and Feng Jiuyou ran over together.

Ye Qingtang returned to her senses and looked at the two boys. Feng Jiuyou and Feng Wuyin had grown a little, and their martial skills had already entered the sub-Emperor Realm.

Years had passed since she parted ways with the Heavenly Emperor. By fate, Ye Qingtang came to the Great Immortal Temple and became the disciple of the Nine Heavens Saint, the Chief Elder of the Great Immortal Temple.

After gaining a firm foothold in the Great Immortal Temple, Ye Qingtang brought Feng Wuyin and Feng Jiuyou here as well.
