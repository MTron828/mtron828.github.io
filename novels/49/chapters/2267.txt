Chapter 2268: Hidden Danger (1)

Soon after Ye Qingtang and the others returned to the Night Soul Beast’s cave, those teenagers, who were exhausted from their ordeal at the fiendcelestial’s tomb, all fell asleep before she could reprimand them.

Mu Ziying had also suffered quite a bit and was clearly very tired, but she forcibly kept her eyes open, not daring to fall asleep.

Seeing this, Ye Qingtang had no choice but to hold her on her knees and coax her to sleep. She let out a quiet sigh as she watched those sleeping brats.

At first, she only wanted to make use of the Netherworld Academy’s Wind-Calming Pearl to leave this mainland. But now, after spending time with these brats, she had somehow developed feelings for them. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Hearing them call her Boss and pestering her all day long, Ye Qingtang was exasperated by their antics.

But her heart also felt a bit warmer.

“I wonder… how Little White Tiger and the others in Central Mainland are…” Ye Qingtang gazed at the greyish forest outside the entrance of the cave.

Since coming to the Second Domain, she had lost contact with everyone in the First Domain.

The voice transmission stone which Ling Yan had given her was unable to connect across the two domains. She had tried to use the voice transmission stone to contact Ling Yan, but the stone remained unresponsive.

While in Central Mainland, she had been taken away by the Temple of Paragon people. The only good thing was that the situation with the Ancient You Clan had already been resolved. Everyone should be safe.

“I wonder if Little White Tiger misses me.” Ye Qingtang glanced at the Night Soul Beast, who was sleeping with its four limbs all sprawled out. She couldn’t help being reminded of that excitable little white tiger.

If she managed to leave this mainland, Ye Qingtang had considered whether to return to the First Domain or remain in the Second Domain, to search for the mystery behind the Heart of the Heavenly Dao.

After pondering for some time, Ye Qingtang decided on the second option.

The Heart of the Heavenly Dao in her body was a great danger. Even the powers of the Divine Phoenix or the Evil Fruit would only be able to temporarily suppress the Heart of the Heavenly Dao. They were not complete solutions.

The only way was to gain a full understanding of this hidden danger, and then try to remove it from her body. Only then could she have true peace. Otherwise, she would never be able to escape her ill fate.

After all, the Heart of the Heavenly Dao did not belong to her. But ever since she could remember, it had existed inside her body. She had tried to ask her foster father Ye Ling if there was anything strange about her when he first found her, but Ye Ling hadn’t noticed anything amiss.

This meant that the Heart of the Heavenly Dao was already inside her body when Ye Ling found her.

But when did the Heart of the Heavenly Dao become part of her?

Probably only her biological mother, Di Jiuyuan, could answer this question.

Ye Qingtang recalled her time in the mystic realm when she met those people from the Dragon Emperor Clan.

Now, they were her only source of information as to what happened to her mother. Only by going to the Dragon Emperor Clan would she be able to find out everything about her mother…

If she remembered correctly, the mainland where the Inter-Academy Competition would be held was the same as the one where the Dragon Emperor Clan was located. If she could help Qin Feng and the others enter the Inter-Academy Competition, she could go with them to that mainland, to uncover the secret behind the Heart of the Heavenly Dao.

At this thought, Ye Qingtang confirmed her next plan of action.
