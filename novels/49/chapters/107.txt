Chapter 108: Break the Array (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Elder Lin, I’m afraid that you are wrong this time.” Elder Qin sneered.

Elder Lin’s face was very unpleasant now. If he had not witnessed the scene with his own eyes, he would never believe that a 15-year-old young lady would be able to break the illusion array once she entered!

The center of the illusion array changed each time it was turned on. Only disciples of the Xuanling Sect would know about the center.

Ye Qingtang was just a candidate, and she was not even born into an array family. How could she break the array within such a short time?

Elder Lin remembered how he looked down at Ye Qingtang previously and felt slightly embarrassed.

“It’s pure luck. It won’t be so easy for the next few assessments.” Elder Lin took a deep breath and tried to hide his surprise towards Ye Qingtang.

Elder Qin took a glimpse at Elder Lin and decided not to reply to him anymore.

He was delighted, but he sighed at the same time.

He was the Elder of the Array Faction, and he definitely preferred disciples who were talented in array formation. He was satisfied with her from the beginning. Her shocking performance during the illusion array made him applaud in awe as well.

She was really a rare and talented person.

However…

Elder Qin sighed secretly.

He would really want to nurture Ye Qingtang if her spirit root was of a higher quality.

Such a pity…

No one would know what the four elders were thinking about.

Ye Qingtang also headed towards the second assessment location after breaking the array.

Ye Qingtang arrived at the place soon, as the two locations were not far from each other.

Yun Shu was waiting for the second assessment to begin when he saw Ye Qingtang coming over. He was a little surprised.

Lu Xiuwen, who was standing nearby, saw Ye Qingtang as well. But his eyes were full of sarcasm.

Ye Qingtang came over slightly after Yun Shu reached the second assessment location. She definitely only spent a little while in the array.

Lu Xiuwen was confident that Ye Qingtang was like the rest of the candidates who were horrified by the monsters in the array.

Lu Xiuwen only glanced at her once and decided not to pay attention to her anymore.

A red spirit root was too inferior for a candidate. She definitely did not stand a chance to enter the sect since she flunked the first assessment.

“Lady Ye.” Yun Shu greeted her politely.

Ye Qingtang took a glimpse at Senior Brother Yun. He wanted to say something but hesitated. She was amused by his reaction.

She was the last candidate for the previous assessment. Only she would know the result of the assessment. It seemed like Senior Brother Yun thought she escaped from the array in fear and that was why he showed such a complex expression.

Senior Brother Yun…

I will not be the useless Junior Sister again anymore.

“Has the second assessment started?” Ye Qingtang smiled and asked.

She did not explain much since if she could enter the sect by the end of the assessments, Yun Shu would know her performances in each assessment.

“It’s going to start soon. The second assessment is also testing on array formation, but it’s a sword array.” Yun Shu said.

Sword array?

Ye Qingtang’s lifted her eyebrows and glanced through the stone table that was around one hundred miles away. The stone table was engraved with the Eight Trigrams, and a sword was placed in the stone, at the center of the Eight Trigrams. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Senior Brother Yun, this is not an array formation…” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“Not an array formation?” Yun Shu was confused.
