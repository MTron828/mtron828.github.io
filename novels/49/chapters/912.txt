Chapter 913 Inheritance of the Divine Phoenix (1)

When they heard Ye Qingtang’s words, everyone from the Divine Virtual Academy nodded vigorously. They immediately fled after receiving amnesty.

They were all deeply afraid that Ye Qingtang would change her mind. They fled the place as fast as they could. Their only regret was that their parents had not given them a few more legs at birth.

“Senior Sister Ye…”

As they looked at the fleeing figures of the people from the Divine Virtual Academy, Li Xiu, Feng Wudang, and Gu Tianhe walked towards Ye Qingtang.

“Senior Sister Ye needs to be more careful. After all, Feng Wuya is the grandson of the Grand Elder of the ancient Feng Clan. Now that Senior Sister Ye has executed him, the ancient Feng Clan will not let take this lying down.”

When he heard what Gu Tianhe said, Li Xiu said, “Senior Sister Ye is a Heavenly Venerate. Since she dared to kill Feng Wuya, she is not afraid of the ancient Feng Clan. There is no need for you to worry unnecessarily.”

Gu Tianhe nodded when he heard that. Only then did he truly realize that this Senior Sister Ye was a Heavenly Venerate. There was nothing to worry about even if she took the life of an ordinary Virtual Arcane Supremacy.

Ye Qingtang said to Feng Wudang, Gu Tianhe, and the others, “I still have other matters to attend to. All of you have to be careful in the Dragon Vein.”

“Don’t worry, Senior Sister Ye,” said Li Xiu.

“Is Senior Sister Ye going to the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix ?” Gu Tianhe asked curiously as he looked at Ye Qingtang.

“That’s right.” Ye Qingtang nodded in agreement without denying it.

Gu Tianhe, Feng Wudang, and the others had previously followed the guidance of the Wintry Yang Aura and passed by the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix.

However, for some reason, the Wintry Yang Aura seemed to repel them. Very few powerful people could be led within by the Wintry Yang Aura.

When she heard this news from Gu Tianhe and the others, Ye Qingtang remained composed and showed no signs of surprise.

It was natural for high-level inheritances of this nature to be like that. It was not that the person chose the inheritance, but that the inheritance chose the person. Not just anyone could enter the eye of the inheritance.

It was naturally like the Heavenly Demon Pearl, which was an inheritance from the Heavenly Demon. Ye Qingtang had originally wanted to obtain the inheritance from the Heavenly Demon, but Ye You had obtained it first, and Ye Qingtang had taken it later. The meaning was completely different.

Under the reverent gaze of the group from the Supreme Academy, Ye Qingtang slowly moved farther and farther away until she vanished from their sight.

With the guidance of the Wintry Yang Aura, after half a day, Ye Qingtang traversed the mountain range and arrived at an idyllic valley.

Ye Qingtang saw over ten men and women, both young and old, gathered at a stream.

The aura of the Divine Arcane Supremacy appeared among them.

Every one of these ten plus people had a formidable presence. They could not be compared with an ordinary Arcane Supremacy.

“Yin Yang Child…”

Ye Qingtang gaze swept over the group of people. At a glance, she saw that Yin Yang Child and the others were also among them.

Ye Qingtang immediately shook her head secretly. Why had Yin Yang Child come to the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix instead of going to the inheritance of the True Dragon… F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Then, she saw another girl arrive. Everyone’s gaze moved over to study her and then moved aside after a while.

“Ah… this inheritance of the Divine Phoenix is so lively. But not just anyone can come here and be acknowledged by the Divine Phoenix.”

An elegant looking girl dressed in green with a sword girded about her waist glanced at Ye Qingtang, then turned up her nose, and sneered.
