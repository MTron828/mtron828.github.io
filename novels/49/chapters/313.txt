Chapter 314: Inner Sect Assessment (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“These ten people’s demeanors are indeed different from everyone else’s. They’re definitely top-notch elites.” The Blood Moon Sect Elder narrowed his eyes while looking at the ten people on the ranking chart. Just standing in the square, he could already feel the rich air around them which made his blood boil with temptation.

“Girl, are you competing with a few of them today?” The Blood Moon Sect Elder took a look at the ten people standing on stage and then looked at Ye Qingtang. Ye Qingtang made huge improvements over the past few days, and this caused him to be even gloomier.

If Ye Qingtang did not gift the Revolving Soul Orb, it would have exploded in these few days.

Unfortunately…

Man proposes, God disposes!

Ye Qingtang shook her head. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

There were countless rounds of competition in the inner sect assessment where outer sect disciples were individually selected.

“The ring today is to contend for the top hundred in the outer sect. I am not participating in it,” Ye Qingtang said coldly. The hundred people who won today still needed to continue sparring to select the top fifty. This continued and ultimately, the top ten people on the ranking chart would be born.

Until a new batch of top ten disciples remained, Ye Qingtang would not take part in it. She had the participation qualification where she could compete on the last day and did not need to go through back-to-back sparring. It was considered as one of the benefits of the thirty thousand Xuanming points spent.

“Not participating? Then what are you here for?” The Blood Moon Sect Elder had a bewildered look.

Ye Qingtang glimpsed at him. “Have you heard the saying ‘to know one’s own strength and the enemy’s is the sure way to victory’?”

“…”

Everyone who met the requirements in the outer sect could take part in the first day of the inner sect assessment. The wide square was boisterous, and disciples clenched their fists in preparation of a good fight.

Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Sect Elder found a corner to observe the match where disciples full of vigor and vitality gave their all.

After rounds of sparring, Ye Qingtang gradually had an insight into the disciples’ skills.

Of course, the top ten people on the ranking charts were skillful. However, Yuan Wei, whom Elder Huang recommended, displayed extraordinary skills on the first day of the competition. In the successive sparring, he never lost once and very quickly became a dark horse in this year’s assessment with his brilliant results.

From dawn to dusk, the competition for the first day lasted for an entire day, and the hundred people who ultimately succeeded were to take part in the competition on the second day.

Seeing that the competition for the day was over, Ye Qingtang dragged the Blood Moon Sect Elder and left.

The next morning, the assessment continued.

Compared to the previous day, although the number of assessment takers reduced by half, the battles were increasingly intense. Fifty people were eventually selected after half a day of battle.

And the third day…

With ten people being able to make it out of the fifty, the fights were even fiercer.

In this period of time, Ye Qingtang went to observe the matches every day.

Until the assessment on the third day was over and only ten outer sect elites remained ultimately.

And among these ten people, there was Yuan Wei, whom Elder Huang recommended!

On the fourth morning, which was also the final battle for the inner sect assessment, the new batch of top ten disciples on the ranking chart was already standing beside the ring. Today, the ten of them will contend for the top three positions which would allow them to enter the inner sect!

Elder Huang was jovial these few days. Yesterday, Yuan Wei was extraordinary in the competition. Not only did he enter the top ten, he even placed fourth on the ranking chart and this really inflated his self-esteem. When he saw Elder Lin from the inner sect yesterday, Elder Lin even offered rare praises.
