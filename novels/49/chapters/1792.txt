Chapter 1793: Stalemate (1)

The Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General glanced over at where Ye Qingtang was, his expression turning complicated. He narrowed his eyes and swept his gaze over her.

Cold sweat dripped soundlessly down Ye Qingtang’s back as she looked at the Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General.

It seemed that even though she had merged with the Deity Ocean, she could only cross space for a short amount of time right now. And she couldn’t stay too long after entering another space either.

How strange... Even though the Deity Ocean could twist space and allow her to escape, it still wanted to return her to this mystic realm..

Was it due to the curse the Cursed True God had left in this mystic realm?

Ye Qingtang was beginning to develop more and more theories about the Deity Ocean but she didn’t have time to think about them. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General finally opened his mouth and asked, “How is it that you can keep entering the twisted space?”

The Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General head was filled with questions. He had initially just wanted to kill this tiny little ant and get the Deity Ocean back but was beginning to realize that things were getting weirder and weirder.

Why could this piece of trash keep entering the twisted space?

“This... I don’t know as well...” Ye Qingtang steeled her nerves and replied. She didn’t dare tell him that she had merged with the Deity Ocean.

The Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General was obviously unsatisfied with her answer and his expression darkened. “Is it because of the Deity Ocean?”

Ye Qingtang’s heart jumped slightly but she continued to maintain her innocent expression.

Impatience flashed across Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General’s face.

“Ha, even if you refuse to admit it, the Deity Ocean is the only thing here that can cross space. It must be on you then.”

The Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General raised his head slightly. He had already realized that even though Ye Qingtang could borrow the power of the Deity Ocean to cross space, the time she spent in the other space was short. As long as he kept an eye on her, she wouldn’t be able to escape.

“If you hand the Deity Ocean over to me nicely, I’ll make sure to give you a dignified death. But if you refuse, I’ll make sure I rip you apart to dig it out of you.”

The Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General narrowed his eyes as his voice became more menacing.

“If I find out that you’ve merged with the Deity Ocean, I will devour you whole.”

Ye Qingtang shuddered, and without waiting for the Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General to react, she gathered up all her strength and ran for her life.

The Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General had already made it clear that she was going to die either way and it didn’t matter whether she handed it over or not. If he found out that she had merged with the Deity Ocean...

Ye Qingtang had no intention of ending up in a demon’s stomach.

“You’re trying to escape? Hmph...” Seeing Ye Qingtang’s rapidly escaping figure, the corners of his mouth curved into a cold smile as he leaped into the sky after her.

Ye Qingtang had used all her strength on increasing her speed but even though the distance between her and the Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General had been vast, he quickly caught up in the blink of an eye.

“You really are persistent!” Ye Qingtang cursed.

“Hand the Deity Ocean over!”

“Do you think I’m stupid? I’ll die even faster if I hand it over.” Ye Qingtang was extremely frustrated. If she had known that the formation of this Deity Ocean would bring her into this cursed mystic realm, she would’ve just stayed earnestly in the Jiang family valley and look for clues to her mother another way!
