Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Zhou Qu turned to look at Ye Qingtang and saw that she actually picked up a light, square handkerchief from the ground.

“I didn’t notice that this handkerchief fell on the ground just now,” Ye Qingtang said as she picked up the handkerchief and straightened herself smilingly.

In that moment…

Everyone was muddled.

The moment Zhou Qu threw out a punch, everyone knew that this sparring was over.

Ye Qingtang was too slow-witted to receive his move. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

However…

No one expected that at that critical moment, Ye Qingtang actually bent down and avoided the attack miraculously.

And what made people more speechless was…

She bent down only to pick the handkerchief on the ground!

Her luck was a little too good!

Everyone felt speechless instantly, and the tense strings in their hearts were suddenly loosened.

Zhou Qu’s imposing punch was dodged by Ye Qingtang so casually, and Zhou Qu’s face turned blue in a moment as well.

If Ye Qingtang did not have just a tiny red spirit root, Zhou Qu would have thought that she was purposely fooling around with him.

“Oh? Senior Brother Zhou already threw out a move? I didn’t notice.” Ye Qingtang held the handkerchief and looked at Zhou Qu a little shockingly as though she just realized that Zhou Qu had already attacked.

The corner of Zhou Qu’s lips twitched, and he wished he could kill this girl who had it easy but was still acting innocent.

“There are still two moves then?” Ye Qingtang asked with a smile.

“There are still two moves, indeed. Junior Sister Ye should be more focused this time,” Zhou Qu said while suppressing his grievance.

“Please go ahead, Senior Brother Zhou.” Ye Qingtang smiled as she kept the small handkerchief.

Zhou Qu did not rest for a moment and launched an attack at Ye Qingtang immediately.

There was a slight change in expression in Ye Qingtang’s eyes. At the moment when Zhou Qu attacked, Ye Qingtang used some mysterious footstep and spun on her heels, turning around. Just by raising her tiny wrist, she directly met with Zhou Qu’s fist which seemed like a careless graze but dispersed the force in Zhou Qu’s fist invisibly. Ye Qingtang turned her palm over and pushed Zhou Qu, forcing him to fall forward again in the direction of the force of his punch.

To others, this scene appeared as Ye Qingtang shifting her body in a panic. Moreover, the position where she raised her hand to block the move was incorrect as well.

But, it was just these two movements that made Zhou Qu punch the air once again. He stumbled forward a few steps due to the force from his punch and almost fell.

After barely regaining his balance, Zhou Qu was utterly confused.

What happened?

How did his punch suddenly become so weak and soft?

Zhou Qu originally suspected whether Ye Qingtang played any tricks, but their interaction just now was only for a moment, and Ye Qingtang only raised his fist with her wrist without using any force.

But what happened to him?

The next move that he had already prepared could not be carried out due to the sudden and violent stumble.

It so happened that Ye Qingtang weirdly dodged this second move.

Two successive failed moves caused Zhou Qu’s expression to turn ugly.

Other disciples did not react much and merely felt that Ye Qingtang was pretty lucky. Furthermore, Zhou Qu did not beat any other new disciples within two moves, though this point was overlooked by everyone.

They only felt that Zhou Qu was purposely going easy.

Only people as skilled as Yun Shu and Lu Xiuwen could tell that both of Zhou Qu’s moves were intended to end the competition immediately.

It was just that Ye Qingtang’s receiving act was too strange, and one really could not tell whether it was because her luck was good or that Zhou Qu went easy on her.
