Chapter 1019 Prosperity (4)

Ye Qingtang began pondering as she looked at these youths.

All of them were outstanding talents of the younger generation, but they were also not short of the typical flaws of true talents: conceit and arrogance.

Naturally, these young talents just entered the Ye Family and still did not have any sense of belonging to the Ye Family. Or perhaps, they treated a family clan as a sect without realizing that the nature of a family clan and a sect were intrinsically different, for there was no need to change the surname to Ye otherwise.

“Since you all have already joined the Ye Family, the Ye Family disciples are all one family. The past grudges shall be written off as of today.” Ye Qingtang slowly spoke after a moment.

The masses were taken aback by Ye Qingtang’s words. From the tone of this lady, she was actually condemning them.

“Who are you to come here and condemn

us?”

A young man on the field frowned deeply as he stared at Ye Qingtang and questioned.

“She is the Eldest Young Lady of the Ye Family.” Then, Ye Yifan, who was beside Ye Qingtang, replied.

“Eldest Young Lady of the Ye Family…”

Everyone present was taken aback.

Before they could process it, the expression of a young lady at the half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord realm changed. “You are… Ye Family’s Yang Lord…”

“What?!”

“The Yang Lord of the Ye Family?!”

Surprise filled everyone’s faces as they looked at Ye Qingtang. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The very reason they came to Lin Town, were willing to change their surname to Ye, and become a Ye Family disciple was that the Ye Family produced a Yang Lord.

However, no one had expected that the Yang Lord of the Ye Family was actually a lady. Moreover, she was very young and seemed to be around their age from her appearance.

“Eldest Young Lady, why are you here?”

Then, Bai Kui and Daoist Zijin arrived as well and were surprised to see Ye Qingtang present.

Seeing that the two Yin Yang Perfected Lords were so reverent to Ye Qingtang, the disciples on the field finally realized that that lady before them was none other than the Yang Lord of the Ye Family.

Bai Kui and Daoist Zijin were both at Yin Yang Perfected Lord Third Heaven yet were so respectful and reverent to this young lady. As long as one was not a fool, anyone could guess the true identity of this young lady.

At this instant, everyone’s eyes burned with awe and veneration as they looked at Ye Qingtang

“Greetings, Yang Lord!”

Dozens of people greeted in uniformity while those who were previously in a tussle were blanked out.

Never would they have expected that this young lady with a striking appearance was actually that unrivaled Yang Lord…

Almost at the same time, the few young men’s faces paled, and they immediately bowed to Ye Qingtang.

“We were unaware that it’s the Yang Lord… Please punish us!”

Cold sweat trickled down the forehead of one of the youths as fear filled him. He almost offended a Yang Lord just now…

“Rise.”

Ye Qingtang waved a hand with an indifferent expression.

The youths felt as though they were pardoned from a crime after hearing Ye Qingtang.

Initially, Elder Bai Kui and Elder Zijin heard that a fight broke out amongst the disciples and thus came over to check on the situation. Unexpectedly, they met Ye Qingtang here.

Since Ye Qingtang was here to handle the issue currently, they naturally would not utter a word and gave Ye Qingtang the full power to act.
