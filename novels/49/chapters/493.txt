The three of them jumped into the clouds and disappeared.

“Three children… You just left like that? Such a disappointment. It’s so rare for me to be involved in a fight. What a waste of my energy.” The Venerable Wu sighed.

Ye Qingtang looked at the Venerable Wu in astonishment.

The Venerable Wu’s cultivation level was so high that he could easily handle the combined attack from the two inner sect disciples of the Yunxiao Sect…

Before Ye Qingtang could ask anything, a few shadows appeared.

The inner sect elders including Elder Mo had arrived. Elder Qin and the Fist Faction elder arrived soon after them.

Among these people, there was a middle-aged man in a black robe. His Martial aura was too very intense.

“Xuanling Sect Master… Li Yunfeng.” Ye Qingtang murmured thoughtfully as she stared at the man.

Ye Qingtang saw the Xuanling Sect Master in her previous life as well. That was why she could recognize him instantly.

“Greetings, elders and sect master.” Ye Qingtang greeted them with hands folded.

Elder Mo nodded slightly.

The sect master and Elder Mo walked towards the Venerable Wu. They folded their hands and said respectfully, “Grand Elder.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The Venerable Wu waved his hand and replied calmly. “Ning Luo was saved by two of the Yunxiao Sect disciples. Return to the sect now and disperse all the disciples.”

The sect elders immediately disappeared without a single word after the Venerable Wu finished his words.

“Grand Elder…” Ye Qingtang stared at the Venerable Wu in front of her. Her eyes were filled with astonishment.

The kind elder that she knew for quite a while at the Sword Spirit Workshop was the Grand Elder of the Xuanling Sect…

“Qingtang, are you injured?” The Venerable Wu walked forward and sized her up.

“Grand Elder!” After knowing the Venerable Wu’s true identity, Ye Qingtang immediately greeted him with her hands folded.

“Haha, young girl, I’m not used to it when you are so serious. Just addressing me as the Venerable Wu will do.” The Venerable Wu smiled and waved his hand.

“Yes… Grand Elder…” Ye Qingtang nodded.

“Isn’t it Venerable Wu?” The Venerable Wu smiled.

“Venerable Wu…” Ye Qingtang had to change her words.

“Qingtang, Xuanling Sect has reached the point of death or survival. You should pack up soon and leave,” the Venerable Wu said after a period long silence.

Ye Qingtang knew what he meant when he finished his sentence.

The Grand Elder knew that the Yunxiao Sect would not let the Xuanling Sect go this time. In order to save the disciples, he intended to disperse all of them…

“We shall return to the sect first.”

A kind smile was still seen on the Venerable Wu’s face.

Soon, the two of them flew into the clouds and rushed back to the Xuanling Sect.

…

Ye Qingtang and the Grand Elder reached the Xuanling Sect after half a day.

A few thousand disciples were gathered at the inner sect square. Even the outer sect disciples were present.

“Junior Sister Ye, you’re finally back!”

Zhu Changge and Qin Huan surrounded Ye Qingtang when she appeared.

“Yes, there’s nothing to worry about,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Qingtang, it’s been a long time since we last met!”

Yun Shu and Lin Long also appeared.

“Usually, it’s rare to see the inner sect elders… Today, all of them finished their seclusion and even asked the outer sect disciples to gather at the inner sect square… I’m not sure what’s going on…” Yun Shu said.

Lin Long frowned as there was an ominous feeling arising in her heart.
