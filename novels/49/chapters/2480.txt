Chapter 2481: Kneel (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The Yongle Tribe General was watching everything with narrowed eyes. His expression suddenly changed when he felt that aura. From his limbs to his bones, everything was trembling.

This aura was unparalleled.

In the distance, the West Sea Tribe General was like a lone boat in the sea as he faced the fire phoenix. His body swayed as if he would be completely devoured if he was careless.

“This… how… how is this possible…”

Under this nearly invincible aura, all of the West Sea Tribe General’s fighting spirit vanished like a lonely old man waiting for death to descend.

This was beyond the understanding of all the demons present. They did not doubt that any living being would disintegrate into dust under this aura.

The demon beast carrying the West Sea Tribe General was terrified. It instinctively wanted to get away, but it seemed to be completely suppressed by the aura and couldn’t move.

“On your knees! This is your last chance!”

The big yellow dog looked at the West Sea Tribe General and roared.

“Thump!”

Ye Qingtang was amazed.

In front of all the other demons, the West Sea Tribe General knelt on the back of his demon beast and looked at Ye Qingtang fearfully. “Please spare me!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

After the West Sea Tribe General finished speaking, the big yellow dog hurriedly gave Ye Qingtang a look. “Ancestor Qing, as the saying goes, those who are ignorant are not guilty. Give him a chance.”

Ye Qingtang was still in a daze and did not know what had happened.

“Ancestor…”

The big yellow dog shouted anxiously when it saw that Ye Qingtang was still in a daze. Instinctively, Ye Qingtang waved her right arm and completely dispersed the power of the fire phoenix.

As the fire phoenix disappeared, the heaven and earth-like pressure completely dissipated.

Seeing this, the West Sea Tribe General slumped down on the beast’s back, his entire body drenched in a cold sweat.

Just now, he had almost disintegrated into thin air. That invincible aura was still lingering in the West Sea Tribe General’s heart. He never wanted to feel that aura again.

Ye Qingtang looked at the big yellow dog meaningfully.

What just happened?

Ye Qingtang’s martial art skills had increased exponentially for no reason. But apart from that, there was nothing else. This should not have scared the West Sea Tribe General into such a state. The Yongle Tribe General, who was beside her, who had looked at her with indifference, now gazed at her with deep fear and respect. There was also an indescribable excitement.

“Ancestor… Ancestor, I deserve to die. I failed to see the truth and offended you. Please forgive me. I won’t do it again!”

The West Sea Tribe General came to his senses and knelt again. He stared at Ye Qingtang in terror.

“Oh? Did you not just say that you must take revenge for me killing your demon son?” Ye Qingtang said.

“No, that stupid fool must have offended you, so his crimes cannot be forgiven. Even if the Ancestor doesn’t kill him, I would have executed him when I found out. I didn’t know that you were really the Ancestor and I offended you… please spare my life!” The West Sea Tribe General’s face was pale.

“Ancestor Qing, the West Sea Tribe and the Yongle Tribe have a deep grudge all these years. Why don’t…” The Yongle Tribe General said to Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang glanced at him. “The Demon Emperor will decide on everything. It is not your place to intervene.”

“I deserve to die!”

The Yongle Tribe General trembled and took a few steps back.. It was true that the Yongle Tribe General had doubted Ye Qingtang’s identity previously, but now, those doubts had dissipated in the presence of that oppressive power.
