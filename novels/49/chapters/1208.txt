1209 The Final Battle 1

After half a day, Ye Qingtang ordered everyone from the Ye Family to retreat to Falling Sky Valley.

The Ancient You Clan had retreated completely because of Ling Yan. They had no choice but to abandon their invasion of this mainland and return to their headquarters.

There was only one commander who remained on the southern battlefield to look for little You Yun. However, Ye Qingtang also knew that this commander was too powerful. If the group from the Ye Family were to remain, they would only sacrifice themselves needlessly.

Evening, at sunset.

In the glow of the golden rays.

Ye Qingtang was holding a gourd of wine and standing in front of a grave marker. Her eyes never left the grave marker in front of her.

The words “The resting place of Hong Heqing, a loyal friend” were clearly engraved on the marker.

They were just a few simple words, but Ye Qingtang found them particularly jarring.

“You’re always looking for me to have a drink…” Ye Qingtang looked at the grave.

“Old man, come out and have a drink with me.”

There was dead silence all around. The wailing of the wind was her only response.

There was no longer anyone to continually bother her.

The one who had continually called “Holy Lady, Holy Lady” was no longer present.

As she looked at the grave marker and the jarring words carved there, Ye Qingtang’s lips suddenly arched in a bitter smile.

She would never have a response.

She suddenly raised the gourd of wine in her hand and poured the sharp liquor down her throat.

Scenes from the past surfaced in her mind as the liquor entered her.

“Humph, I am the Blood Moon Sect Elder!”

“Now that I’m here, hadn’t you better kneel in submission?!”

“Holy Lady… this place is dangerous…”

“Holy Lady… how can you order me to possess a woman? I don’t want to be a woman…”

“I… Hong Heqing, promise… I will complete my mission!”

The frank laughter seemed to ring out again and deafen her.

But she could only vaguely hear it as it reverberated in her mind.

By the time Ye Qingtang left the Blood Moon Elder’s grave, a few days had passed.

The army of the Ancient You Clan had mostly left. The entire mainland was scarred and battered like a wasteland.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang had yet to return to Falling Sky Valley. She was searching everywhere for little Luo Xue and little You Yun.

Three days ago, in a ruined city on the southern battlefield, Absolute Monarch of Heaven, Yin Yang Child, and the others suddenly appeared by Ye Qingtang’s side.

Before the major battle erupted, Ye Qingtang had ordered Absolute Monarch of Heaven, Yin Yang Child, and the rest to investigate the mysterious commander of the Ancient You Clan.

Absolute Monarch of Heaven and the others had descended from the void into the ruined city and arrived at Ye Qingtang’s side. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Miss Ye,” the Absolute Monarch of Heaven said as he looked at Ye Qingtang.

“Brother Monarch of Heaven…” Ye Qingtang nodded slightly.

“Regarding the matter that Miss Ye entrusted to us, we have completed our investigations,” Absolute Monarch of Heaven said seriously. “We have looked into the commander’s identity, but I’m afraid its bad news for Miss Ye.”

“Brother Monarch of Heaven, go ahead and speak frankly,” Ye Qingtang said with a frown.

“Very well.” Absolute Monarch of Heaven nodded. “The commander is the Deputy Clan Master of the Ancient You Clan…”

Ye Qingtang’s face was filled with shock after hearing Absolute Monarch of Heaven’s words.

She had not imagined that the commander was the Deputy Clan Master of the Ancient You Clan… No wonder even powerful generals like You Tong were so awed by this commander.

“Miss Ye, the Deputy Clan Master of the Ancient You Clan currently has two children with him, a boy and a girl. They are heading for the mountains in Tianyun. He intends to manipulate the girl to absorb the lives of all living things in this mainland. We can no longer remain in this mainland,” a black-robed old man said.
