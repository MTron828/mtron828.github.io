1223 Central Mainland 3

Ye Qingtang subconsciously reached for her sword, but when it was still half-drawn, the Undead standing before her suddenly bent their knees and simultaneously kneeled before her.

“…” Ye Qingtang stared blankly.

“Do the Undead perform this ritual before killing someone?” The little white tiger was rather stunned.

Were they polite… or just perverted?

But just as Ye Qingtang and the little white tiger were feeling bewildered, the Undead suddenly raised their heads and opened their skeletal mouths. Distorted voices suddenly issued from their mouths.

“Holy Lord! You have finally returned!!”

Their voices even had a sobbing note.

“…” Ye Qingtang was speechless.

Holy Lord?

What the hell?!

“Holy Lord, you’ve been gone for so long! We thought you were tired of us…”

“Holy Lord, please don’t leave us again. Come back with us…”

The Undead who had seemed so terrifying previously now raised their voices and wailed. If not for the characteristics of their race, they would probably be weeping.

“Holy Lord, everyone misses you very much. We even carry your picture with us so that we can pay our respects to you every day…”

When an Undead saw that the “Holy Lord” before them still did not reply, it decided to show its sincerity by taking a worn-out scroll from its robes and opening it before Ye Qingtang.

A stunningly beautiful girl was drawn on the paper. And she looked just like Ye Qingtang.

Understanding finally dawned on Ye Qingtang.

When she came to Central Mainland in her previous life, she had heard a rumor about the Temple of Shadows.

Rumor had it that the Holy Lord of the Temple of Shadows was incomparably powerful. She had led the Undead Clan in this mainland to the height of their power.

But a few thousand years ago, this Holy Lord had mysteriously vanished. Since then, the powerful Temple of Shadows had declined, and the Undead in the entire mainland had lost their power.

No one knew why the Holy Lord of the Temple of Shadows had vanished. In the legends, many rumors surrounded this disappearance. Some said that the Holy Lord had gone missing while others said that she had gone into seclusion to cultivate… Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Now, it looked like the Holy Lord had gone missing. As she looked just like the Holy Lord, the Undead had taken her for their long lost Holy Lord.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang finally understood the situation. She also realized that she was in no position to deny the status of the Holy Lord.

The Undead she was facing were so powerful that she certainly could not resist them. If she denied that she was the Holy Lord, it would probably enrage these Undead.

At that point…

Ye Qingtang took a deep breath, put on an aloof look, and looked at the Undead.

“I have returned.”

The Undead were so moved by their “Holy Lord’s” reply that they trembled until their skeletons creaked.

The man with the goatee who had planned everything was completely taken aback.

He had planned to lure the Undead away so that he could escape but had not expected that…

This girl was the legendary long-lost Holy Lord of the Temple of Shadows?!!!

The man with the goatee instantly turned pale.

He had truly made a grave mistake.

The man with the goatee almost subconsciously turned to flee.
