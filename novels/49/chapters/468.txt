Chapter 469: Internal Strife? (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

After Yue Tiancheng died, Ye Qingtang waved an arm over him, and a golden flame burned him completely into nothing.

Then, Ye Qingtang turned around and sprinted to Ji Yixuan. Looking at the stunned Ji Yixuan, Ye Qingtang walked forward and asked, “Ji Yixuan, do you wish to escape from the array formation?”

Ji Yixuan frowned slightly at that. There were no emotions as he looked at the young girl who killed her fellow sect disciple. “So what if I wish to or not? Would you all, Yunxiao Sect disciples, would let me off?”

Ye Qingtang could not help but laugh and shake her head as she saw how Ji Yixuan was still so cold. “So you think that Yue Tiancheng and I had an internal strife and that I killed him.”

“Isn’t it?” Ji Yixuan’s brows were furrowed.

The supposed sect ties were nothing compared to how some disciples bred enmity between each other and secretly struck when they were out of the sect.

Ye Qingtang looked at Ji Yixuan who stood there helplessly, and an evil smile flashed across her eyes. Then, she nodded and said, “Yes, you guessed it right. I have an internal strife with Yue Tiancheng. Yue Tiancheng has the Regeneration Stone and even a Dharma treasure, Demon Subduing Pagoda… When I kill him, these items are naturally mine.”

“Ha…” Ji Yixuan stared at Ye Qingtang and scoffed. “Do you think that Yunxiao Sect would not realize it when you kill Yue Tiancheng? If they find out, Yunxiao Sect would naturally not let you off, and Falling Sky Valley would not let you off since you obtained the Demon Subduing Pagoda.”

“You don’t have to worry, Ji Yixuan. You are already someone who is about to die. Don’t waste any more saliva talking. Just take a look at this world for the last time.” Ye Qingtang shrugged slightly and left directly without being concerned about what Ji Yixuan said.

As Ji Yixuan watched Ye Qingtang leave, Ji Yixuan slowly shut his eyes as the breath of destruction intensified gradually.

However, right at that moment!

Swoosh!

The shadow of a Demonic Blood Sword emerged. The Demonic Blood Sword in Ye Qingtang’s hand shot past and knocked on the array formation hardly.

This array formation in a talisman was difficult to break from the inside, but if attacked from the outside, it was relatively simple to break it.

Swoosh!

As Ye Qingtang’s sword landed, there was a sound of broken glass in the sealed array formation.

Almost instinctively, Ji Yixuan fled from the broken array formation instantly.

A few breaths later, Ji Yixuan looked at Ye Qingtang in disbelief.

This Yunxiao Sect disciple actually cracked the array formation and allowed him to escape?

“Why did you do this?” Ji Yixuan had a confused expression.

Even if Yunxiao Sect disciples fought internally, this girl launched a sneak attack and killed Yue Tiancheng but should not have released him.

“You’re indeed the same as what Master described. How boring…” Ye Qingtang tilted her head as she scanned Ji Yixuan up and down

“Master? What do you mean?” Confusion filled Ji Yixuan. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“I was just joking with you just now. I am not a Yunxiao Sect disciple,” Ye Qingtang said honestly.

“Really?” Ji Yixuan frowned.

“Otherwise, why would I save you?” Ye Qingtang chuckled.

“This…” Ji Yixuan was at a loss of words at that moment.

Ji Yixuan initially thought that he would die without a doubt today, yet unexpectedly, a random girl of an unknown origin saved him, and even Yue Tiancheng, that small disciple of Yunxiao Sect Sect Master, was tricked and killed by her.

“Hurry back to your sect and submit your mission.” Ye Qingtang took the Regeneration Stone from Yue Tiancheng and tossed it to Ji Yixuan without hesitation.
