Chapter 942 Devouring Bloodline (5)

Ye Qingtang looked at the girl in green and said coldly, “Your Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline is truly terrifying. But I must thank you.”

Ye Qingtang served the girl in green with her own words.

With just the Divine Phoenix Bloodline, she had exchanged it for the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline.

As she spoke, the corners of Ye Qingtang’s lips curved upwards into a bone-chilling smile. She strode over to the girl in green.

Who knew how many powerful bloodlines the girl in green had devoured using her Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline?

Now, she herself possessed the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline. If she could devour all the girl’s bloodlines…

“Good… very good…” The girl in green stared at Ye Qingtang. Her expression wa gloomy. “Change is bound to happen. Today, you have seized my Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline. In the future, I will force you to repay me a million times over!”Read more chapters at L isnovel

When the girl in green finished speaking, her entire person suddenly integrated into space and she vanished on the spot as if she had evaporated.

Ye Qingtang only relaxed when she was certain that the girl in green had left completely.

This situation was completely unexpected. Ye Qingtang had been content with the original Phoenix Bloodline from the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix. Now, she had seized the girl in green’s Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline in some strange way and could devour the power of all the bloodlines in this world!

The Devouring Bloodline was a power that was absolutely taboo. It could make a cultivator invincible but could also force them into eternal damnation.

Ye Qingtang was certain that once others knew that she possessed the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline, she would be relentlessly pursued to the death.

Possessing the Devouring Bloodline was a sin. In this world, no one hoped that the power of their bloodline would be devoured by someone else. As a result, once someone who possessed the Devouring Bloodline was discovered, the results were easily predictable.

“What the f*ck… Devouring bloodline…” Little white tiger suddenly poked its head out of Ye Qingtang’s arms. With a shocked expression, it said, “You are incredibly lucky! It’s actually the Devouring Bloodline… this kind of bloodline can easily devour the power of us fiendcelestial beasts.”

“Oh?” Ye Qingtang was shocked.

The Devouring Bloodline seldom appeared in this world. In both her lives, Ye Qingtang had heard of the Devouring Bloodline but had never seen it.

“Only the most outstanding among the Heavenly Demon Clan can possess the Devouring Bloodline… Further, the Heavenly Demon Clan is an alien race. In primordial times, it almost extinguished all living beings. In the end, the true god created a barrier and drove them into an alien space. However, the Heavenly Demon Clan said that they would return someday…” the little white tiger said thoughtfully.

Ye Qingtang now possessed the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline. If the Heavenly Demon Clan should break through the seal one day, would they take Ye Qingtang for one of their own…

“This is the first time I have come into contact with the Devouring Bloodline… You said just now that the Devouring Bloodline can even devour the power of the fiendcelestial beasts?” Ye Qingtang asked as she looked at the little white tiger. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“That’s right.” The little white tiger nodded vigorously.

“There is no power that the Devouring Bloodline cannot devour! Even if you meet the true god, you can devour all his power and transform it into a part of yourself. That’s why the Devouring Bloodline is called the Taboo Bloodline of Power. If the bloodlines were ranked, the Devouring Bloodline would be superior to the power of thousands of other bloodlines. It is one of the powerful primordial bloodlines.”
