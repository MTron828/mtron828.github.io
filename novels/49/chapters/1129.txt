Chapter 1130: Kill Her (2)

A cold-looking man that was as elegant as a God suddenly appeared beside Ye Qingtang. He suddenly stuck a finger out and directly blocked the demonic creature’s powerful punch.

When Ye Qingtang took a clear look at that man’s face, she was instantly taken aback.

“Han Cangming…”

Why was he here?!

Swoosh!

Without seeing how Han Cangming moved, a sword gleam flashed by and pierced through the demonic creature’s body.

The moment the sword gleam flashed by, the demonic creature let out a miserable wail, and its body fell forward, causing a deep dent on the ground.

Afterward, Han Cangming turned around and looked at Ye Qingtang.

It was just eye contact, but Ye Qingtang’s body stiffened.

In the next second, however, Ye Qingtang felt a trace of familiarity in Han Cangming’s gaze.

Every time she saw Han Cangming previously, his eyes were extremely cold as though there was not the slightest warmth in it. However, for some reason today… there was actually a subtle difference.

Han Cangming was slightly confused as he looked at Ye Qingtang, whom he had not seen for a long time.

He was originally on his way to Central Mainland, but for some reason, his thoughts seemed to be invaded by something, and he returned to this mainland.

Even Han Cangming himself was unsure why he returned. It was just that he instinctively thought that this seemed to be what he should do…

“Oh… You finally appeared.”

Suddenly, a blood-colored swirl formed in the air.

In the next second, the Blood Moon Holy Lord appeared before Ye Qingtang and the rest.

“Younger brother?!”

Ye Qingtang was perplexed when she saw Blood Moon Holy Lord.

What was it with today?

First came Antiquity Palace’s Palace Lord, Han Cangming, and then even her cheapskate younger brother, the Blood Moon Holy Lord, appeared afterward…

If these two were here to save this mainland, Ye Qingtang would be glad to have two more incredible helpers.

But given the current situation, Ye Qingtang vaguely sensed that something was off.

“Holy Lord!”

The Blood Moon Elder immediately bowed at Blood Moon Holy Lord.

The Blood Moon Holy Lord’s eyes passed by Ye Qingtang quietly, and a trace of emotion seemed to flash by in the depth of his eyes. When he looked up again, he told the Blood Moon Elder coldly. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Kill that person.”

“Huh? Holy Lord, you want me to kill him?” Blood Moon Elder was startled and instinctively thought that Blood Moon Holy Lord was instructing him to attack Han Cangming, who appeared a while before.

The Blood Moon Elder had goosebumps when he took a look at Han Cangming.

Before the Blood Moon Elder spoke again, Blood Moon Holy Lord suddenly raised a hand, and his slender fingers pointed at Ye Qingtang.

“The person I want you to kill… is her.”

Blood Moon Holy Lord’s words stunned both Blood Moon Elder and Ye Qingtang.

What was going on?!

“Kill… Kill Holy Lady? Holy Lord, why do you want to kill Holy Lady?!” Blood Moon Elder was extremely shocked by Blood Moon Holy Lord’s instructions.

He could not believe it. Holy Lord actually wanted him to kill Holy Lady… Why?!

“Are you questioning me?” Blood Moon Holy Lord said without emotions.

“But…” Blood Moon Elder gritted his teeth. “Holy Lord… I cannot follow your orders! Furthermore, I am not Holy Lady’s opponent!”

Blood Moon Elder did not know what Holy Lord wanted him to kill Holy Lady, but if… he really had to make a choice between Blood Moon Holy Lord and Holy Lady…
