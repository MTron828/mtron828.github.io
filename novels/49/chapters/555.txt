Chapter 556 We Will Meet Again Some Day (1)

“No no no… It’s not infatuation nor loyalty… It’s…” The Blood Moon Elder was soaked in cold sweat, and his thoughts were rather jumbled. As he thought of his disrespect towards the Blood Moon Holy Lady, even if he had a million heads and they were all chopped off, it would not be enough to redeem himself. Fear intensified within him, and in addition to being glared at by Ye Qingtang, he trembled continuously, and his mind was blank. “It’s what the heart thinks. All our hearts become one, do what the heart wants, two hearts beat as one…”

..” Ye Qingtang stared at him, startled. Did this old fellow lose his mind?

“I think you are working your heart out while your heart is startled. You shaking with fear means that you have a guilty conscience.” Ye Qingtang was completely amused by the Blood Moon Elder.

“Holy Lady… Have mercy, Holy Lady!” The Blood Moon Elder’s face turned white in an instant.

“Did you want to say a heart of sincerity?” Ye Qingtang had a teasing expression. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Yes… Yes yes yes yes!” The Blood Moon Elder slapped his thigh and nodded continuously. “Holy Lady is right. It is a heart of sincerity. The heart of sincerity I have towards Holy Lady can be appraised by Heaven and Earth, the Sun and Moon…”

Before Blood Moon Elder finished speaking, Ye Qingtang waved a hand again and interrupted him as she stared at the Blood Moon Elder in curiosity. “How exactly did you reach the position of the Blood Moon Elder?”

“I… I don’t know either…” Puzzlement filled the Blood Moon Elder’s face. “Although I also felt that I could become a Blood Moon Guardian with my skills back then, the Blood Moon Holy Lord did not pay me any attention… so I could only be an Elder…”

Finally, Ye Qingtang gave the Blood Moon Elder who was close to losing his mind a big thumbs-up. “You’ve won.”

In Xuanling Sect, Elder Mo and Elder Qin looked at each other.

Wasn’t that Blood Moon Elder their Xuanling Sect disciple, Zhou Qu…

But thinking about it carefully, if Ye Qingtang could become a Blood Moon Holy Lady, there seemed to be nothing strange if Zhou Qu was the Blood Moon Elder.

Although Xuanling Sect feared the resurrection of Blood Moon Sect due to the rumors previously, thinking about it now, Ye Qingtang did not do anything to harm Xuanling Sect and even led the Blood Moon Sect members here today which prevented the tragedy of Xuanling Sect’s annihilation.

To the Xuanling Sect masses, the words “Blood Moon Sect” were no longer frightening as before. Rather, Yunxiao Sect whom they had always revered wanted to massacre them.

After this battle, the distinction between the righteous and the evil blurred in their hearts.

What exactly was righteous? And what was evil?

The Blood Moon Sect had countless terrifying rumors, but how many of them were started by the various super sects? The credibility of these rumors…

“Qingtang, why aren’t you fleeing yet! Once more people from Yunxiao Sect come, you will not be able to flee anymore!” The Grand Elder shouted to Ye Qingtang.

“Qingtang, don’t worry about us. Lingyun Sect and Yuehua Sect are reasonable sects. With the support of this array formation, Yunxiao Sect cannot do anything to Xuanling Sect!” Elder Mo looked at Ye Qingtang and said.

Although Lingyun Sect and Yuehua Sect were known to be super sects just like Yunxiao Sect, they were much more upright and honorable than Yunxiao Sect.

At least, Lingyun Sect and Yuehua Sect had no scandals of allowing the sect disciples to snatch others’ spirit roots.

With the appearance of Yuehua Sect and Lingyun Sect currently, Yunxiao Sect would probably be suppressed by them from then on once they learned of the reason behind Yunxiao Sect’s decision to annihilate Xuanling Sect. Even if Yunxiao Sect wanted to do anything, they had to relatively exercise more restraint.

“Junior Sister Ye, don’t worry about us!”

Qin Huan, Zhu Changge, and other sect disciples shouted as well.
