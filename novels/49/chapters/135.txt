It’s her?

Lin Long’s looked over the arena, and an unhappy expression emerged in her eyes when she saw Zhou Qu. She had heard some things about this arena as well but…

She did not expect that Ye Qingtang, who appeared very calm, would actually look for trouble like others. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Instinctively, she stood aside and watched on quietly.

After confirming that Ye Qingtang had four bottles of Xi Spirit Pills, Zhou Qu almost struck immediately without warming up.

The four additional bottles now would cover the quota given to them in two months.

“Sure. Since Junior Sister Ye is so sincere, I will accept it as your senior brother. After three moves, my four bottles of Xi Spirit Pills will be all yours if you can receive my moves,” Zhou Qu said as he purposely feigned generosity and placed four bottles of Xi Spirit Pills aside.

However, he was very clear that Ye Qingtang definitely did not have the ability to take away these four bottles and would have to give him four bottles instead.

He was not afraid of Ye Qingtang going back on her words: anyone in the arena in the sect must follow rules, and if anyone went back on their words, they would be punished once the news traveled to into the warden’s ears.

“Please take care of me, senior brother.” Ye Qingtang cupped one hand in another, and she lowered her eyes as a sly look flashed across in her eyes.

Zhou Qu nodded aloofly and focused on his breathing. This time, he did not intend to play the same trick and go easy on the first two moves.

Anyway, no one would go up the arena after Ye Qingtang, and he obviously wanted to finish her as quickly as possible.

Below the arena, an ominous feeling rose up within Yun Shu as he looked at Zhou Qu directing his energy.

The method Zhou Qu used to direct his energy was extremely similar to the one he used in the third method previously. Could it be that he wanted to finish Ye Qingtang in the first move?

Yun Shu could not help but frown.

“Brother Yun, I’m afraid you’ll be in deep waters because of Ye Qingtang.” Lu Xiuwen’s voice rang beside Yun Shu’s ears.

Yun Shu looked over and saw that Lu Xiuwen actually came to his side since some time ago.

“Ye Qingtang has another two bottles of Xi Spirit Pills in her hands. Those should be yours, right? I know that Brother Yun is kind by nature, but there are some things that shouldn’t be compromised so easily like this. You should have seen the outcome of all the other junior and senior brothers previously. How would Ye Qingtang be able to withstand three moves from Senior Brother Zhou?”

Yun Shu merely looked at him coldly without saying anything.

Lu Xiuwen was not too bothered; he merely wanted to watch the two of them embarrass themselves in front of him.

On the arena, Zhou Qu had already gathered his force in his fists. With a sudden loud roar and a quick jump, he dashed for Ye Qingtang directly!

Ye Qingtang remained rooted to the ground calmly as though she did not see Zhou Qu’s incoming powerful punch.

Everyone below the arena was already trembling in fear at the sight. Seeing how Ye Qingtang stood still without any intention to receive the move, they thought that Ye Qingtang was really seeking death and would be knocked out by Zhou Qu without even withstanding one move.

However…

Just when Zhou Qu’s punch was about to land on Ye Qingtang’s face, Ye Qingtang suddenly bent down.

The timing when she bent down was too ingenious. When Zhou Qu threw an extremely powerful punch, her small movement caused Zhou Qu to end up punching the air without warning!

Zhou Qu was indeed a little dumbfounded when he punched the air. He clearly saw Ye Qingtang remaining still as though she was too stunned to move. How was it that this girl suddenly bent down and avoided his punch the moment he attacked?
