Chapter 2057: Little You Yun (2)

Little You Yun seemed to have become the Spiritual Abode carrier and the Ancient You Clan was using her to absorb its power.

Why had they left all the important members of the Ancient You Clan here?

Because they had transformed this place to an endless supply of power feeding them!

Ye Qingtang looked at Little You Yun, who looked exactly like she was in her memories. But the situation in front of her made her heart ache. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Beside her, Ning Luo’s gaze was cold. He was staring right at his master whom he had been seeking for a long time but the sight just made his blood boil.

Humans would forever be this selfish...

In the next second, Ning Luo flew up and leaped towards Little You Yun.

Boom!

A loud boom rumbled through the air.

A huge wave of power suddenly rippled forth from little You Yun, throwing Ning Luo away from her. Ignoring the intense pain coursing through his body, he looked up at the master he had looked forward to seeing for so many years.

What was going on?

There was no reaction from Little You Yun at all. Her eyes remained shut and she showed no signs of waking up. Ning Luo was about to step forward again when she was stopped by Ye Qingtang.

“Look at the light around her,” she said.

“What do you mean?” he asked.

“Little You Yun seems to still be in deep sleep. The light on her chest is the power of the Spiritual Abode, but the lights around her are the work of the Ancient You Clan. They’re using the light to power their entire underground world and it has formed a barrier around her using the power of the Spiritual Abode as well.

“You have to find a way to destroy those lights around her if you want to save her.”

Ning Luo frowned and nodded.

Ye Qingtang looked carefully at the threads of light around her and realized that there were 107 of them. Excluding the pagoda they were currently in, this corresponded exactly to the number of pagodas in the underground world.

Lifting her sword, she tried destroying the threads but to no avail.

“It seems like we have to destroy the pagodas to destroy these lights...” Her brows furrowed slightly.

This was not good news at all. Even though the Ancient You Clan had already sent their best soldiers out to battle the Crimson League, there was still a small group of people guarding the underground world.

It would be easy for them to sneak Little You Yun out, but to destroy 107 pagodas under their noses...

That was impossible.

“Do we not have any other options?” Ning Luo’s face was falling.

“Give me a little more time to think.” She knew that they didn’t have much time, and her mind was racing, seeking a way as quickly as it could. But just as she was still pondering how to get rid of the barrier, a figure suddenly appeared behind her.

“Leave this place now,” a cold voice said.

They turned towards the voice, only to realize...

Little Luo Xue had somehow appeared behind them.

Ye Qingtang was shocked.

Why was he back?

She had personally seen him being brought away.

He gazed at them emotionlessly as the aura around him started stirring.

It would be an easy feat for him to kill them off!
