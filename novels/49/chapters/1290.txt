Chapter 1291: The Eternal Royal Family (2)

A look of cold amusement flashed across the Eldest Prince’s eyes. He had no friendly feelings for this younger sister who was always vying with him for the throne.

The Eldest Prince could not help but be somewhat worried when the Second Princess had sought the support of the Advisor. In recent years, the Eternal Emperor’s health had declined steadily, and the fight for the throne had become more intense.

Although the Eldest Prince knew that the Temple of Shadows had chosen him, he had yet to see the Temple of Shadows make a move. He could not help but worry, so he had invited the ambassadors from the Temple of Shadows to provide added security.

When he thought of that, the Eldest Prince’s gaze involuntarily fell on Ling Yan, who had yet to speak.

The truth was, he was more worried about this Third Royal Brother than the Second Princess.

Everyone was aware of Ling Yan’s brilliance. However, Ling Yan had not appeared to ally himself with any other power. As a result, the Eldest Prince had not taken him seriously before, although he had tried various schemes to get rid of him.

However, Ling Yan had escaped unscathed from these schemes. This had caused the Eldest Prince to be even warier of Ling Yan’s ability and intelligence.

However…

Now that the ambassadors from the Temple of Shadows had arrived, he felt even surer of seizing the throne.

Although Ling Yan was brilliant, it would be extremely difficult for him to oppose the Temple of Shadows and the Sacred Ground of Reflection.

On the surface, the banquet was a picture of harmony. But fierce currents lurked beneath the surface.

The Eternal Emperor looked at the three ambassadors from the Temple of Shadows. He had met Lady Ghost before, but the other two were unfamiliar. “Some matters have arisen within the dynasty recently. If we are remiss in anything, I hope the ambassadors from the Temple will forgive us.”

Lady Ghost smiled and said, “Before we arrived, the Eldest Prince already told us that the Fourth Prince recently passed away. The Emperor must be deeply grieved.”

The Eternal Emperor could not help but sigh softly at the mention of the Fourth Prince. “I am already old, and it is time to consider the matter of succession. Miao’er was unfortunate to die at such a young age. This had brought me much grief.”

The Eternal Emperor’s passing comment caused all the princes, princesses, and senior ministers present to prick up their ears.

“Although Miao’er is dead, the Eternal Dynasty needs a new crown prince to reassure the people. I do not have many children, and they are all seated here today.” As the Eternal Emperor spoke, his loving gaze swept across his sons and daughters who were seated at the banquet.

The Eternal Emperor seemed to be hinting at something.

At that moment, the Eldest Prince and Princess were the most agitated. Today’s banquet was to entertain the guests from the Temple of Shadows, but the Eternal Emperor had brought up the matter of succession. Was he hinting at something?

The Eldest Prince felt assured of victory, whether in terms of timing, location, or support.

An expectant look involuntarily surfaced in his eyes.

Rather, it was the Second Princess who looked rather pale. She had already arrived at the same conclusion as the Eldest Prince. At that moment, she could not conceal her inner unease. She kept glancing out of the hall. After a while, a look of joy suddenly surfaced in her eyes. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Your Majesty worries too much. Your Majesty is still hale. There is no need to make hasty decisions regarding the succession.” A casual voice suddenly rang out from outside the entrance of the main hall.

Everyone looked over and saw a white-robed old man with white hair slowly walk through the door of the main hall.

This old man had a suave and other-worldly air.

“Advisor, you’re late.” The Eternal Emperor looked up and said with a smile.
