After returning into the monarch city, Ye Qingtang brought the little white tiger straight to Falling Sky Valley.

She had the Millennium Meteoric Iron in her hands and was acquainted with Master Du now. It seemed that there should not be any problem to enter Falling Sky Valley.

But just as Ye Qingtang just left the street of the monarch city, a few figures suddenly followed behind her.

“Senior Brother Chu, does that fellow really have Millennium Meteoric Iron?” A youth in the Tiangang Sect uniform asked Chu Yi as he fixed his eyes on Ye Qingtang not far away.

Chu Yi laughed coldly and nodded while looking at Ye Qingtang.

In the Bliss Forging Workshop earlier on, he already knew that this pretty young man possessed the Millennium Meteoric Iron. The Millennium Meteoric Iron was extremely precious, and he would obviously not let it go easily. Furthermore…

Chu Yi narrowed his eyes slightly. This fellow caused him to embarrass himself in front of Master Du just now and ruined his meteoric iron sword. How would he let him off so easily?

“He should have quite an amount of Millennium Meteoric Iron. You will go there with me later and steal his Millennium Meteoric Iron,” Chu Yi said. After leaving the Bliss Forging Workshop, he immediately found a junior brother from the same master in the monarch city, and both of them came over together this time with the intention of robbing the fat sheep before them.

“But looking at the path he is taking, it seems that he is heading towards Falling Sky Valley. Could she be a Falling Sky Valley disciple?” that youth said hesitantly.

Falling Sky Valley and their Tiangang Sect were comparable in skills, though their relations had always been far from good. They were currently in Falling Sky Valley’s boundary. If that young man was a Falling Sky Valley disciple and others in the Falling Sky Valley discovered them, they would not gain any benefit with just two of them.

“You’re worrying too much. He is not a Falling Sky Valley disciple and is merely an ordinary itinerant. Why are you nagging so much? If we let him run away, we will never have a chance to obtain Millennium Meteoric Iron in our lives. You must know that if we can wield a weapon made from Millennium Meteoric Iron, it would be extremely grand and impressive,” Chu Yi said impatiently.

Upon hearing the words “Millennium Meteoric Iron,” the youth had a thought in his mind as well.

The two of them nodded immediately. They were both at the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three currently. Apart from the disciples of large forces, in the entire Nine Nights Dynasty, an ordinary itinerant could not be their opponent.

As Ye Qingtang headed towards Falling Sky Valley, she suddenly sensed two unusual auras behind her. She stopped and turned around.

In the next instant, Chu Yi and that youth immediately appeared in Ye Qingtang’s line of sight.

When Ye Qingtang saw Chu Yi, her brows raised automatically.

“F*ck. Could it be that this bastard saw through my identity and are after us?” The little white tiger asked quietly when it saw Chu Yi once again.

“…” Ye Qingtang looked at the delusional little white tiger speechlessly.

It was really thinking too much…

Chu Yi had never looked at it properly from the start to the end, alright?

“We meet again.” Chu Yi looked at Ye Qingtang, who stopped in her tracks, without bothering that his actions were discovered. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“What business do you two have?” Ye Qingtang asked with a poker face.

Chu Yi laughed. “Little brother, you ruined my sword in the Bliss Forging Workshop just now. You couldn’t have forgotten about this score, could you?”
