Chapter 1552 Jade Pendant 2

How can this be?

Ye Qingtang was inwardly shocked but continued to look calm.

“Mother, did your clansman draw this girl from life?” Ye Qingtang calmed herself down. Perhaps Mo Yi’s clansman had added the jade pendant later on.

But Mo Yi chuckled softly. “Impossible. Although my clansman was besotted with Jiu Yuan, he did not dare to approach her. However, he had the ability to memorize anything he saw. He secretly drew this picture, but I heard from other clansmen who saw Jiu Yuan that it was identical to Jiu Yuan in every detail. Even the pattern on her clothes and her accessories were exactly the same. He did not change anything.”

Mo Yi’s words were like a stone thrown into a lake, creating a series of ripples in Ye Qingtang’s heart.

If that was so, then the jade pendant must belong to Jiu Yuan, right?

Ye Qingtang had come to Central Mainland firstly to save little You Yun and release all the living things in the First Mainland, and secondly, to search for her birth mother.

In the past, she had suspected that her mother was in the Central Dynasty. And now, Jiu Yuan had appeared in the Central Dynasty...

Was this a coincidence or...

Ye Qingtang’s heart was filled with questions, and she continued to ask about Jiu Yuan.

“Jiu Yuan appeared suddenly, but her talents were stunning. She completely devastated the top talents of her generation in Central Mainland. She topped the rankings and entered the mystical abyss, but something happened to her there. I heard that after she was in a strange mood after she emerged from the mystical abyss, and she flew away and vanished...”

Mo Yi slowly recounted this. Her knowledge of Jiu Yuan was due to her clansman, who was besotted with Jiu Yuan.

The more Ye Qingtang heard, the more shocked she felt.

Jiu Yuan’s age was similar to that of her mother. The jade pendant was certainly the same, and it had also appeared in the Central Dynasty.

The clues mounted up, and Ye Qingtang increasingly felt that this Jiu Yuan might be her birth mother!

When Ye Qingtang had first arrived in the Central Dynasty, her plans had been disrupted by the Jiang Family. She did not expect to find a clue about her mother in the Jiang Family.

Mystical abyss...

Based on what Mo Yi and the others said, Jiu Yuan had entered the mystical abyss. Perhaps Ye Qingtang could find more clues about Jiu Yuan there.

“Tang Tang, you seem very interested in the Martial Arts Championship? Sigh...” Jiang Xun did not know that Ye Qingtang was interested in Jiu Yuan and thought that she was interested in the Martial Arts Championship.

Based on Ye Qingtang’s abilities, she would not qualify to enter the Martial Arts Championships. Although she was now entering the Elder Cabinet, she probably would not have any major breakthroughs for a few years.

By the time her learning was complete, she would be too old to meet the requirements for the Martial Arts Championship.

Ye Qingtang did not say anything, but she continued to ponder the matter.

In her previous life, she had not known her parentage and had passed her life in confusion.

In this life, she wanted to know who her parents were and whether they were still alive.

Ye Qingtang had not been very interested in this Martial Arts Championship, but now that clues about her mother were in the mystical abyss, she would have to try her best.

There was still half a year to go. She still had a chance.

Mo Yi and Jiang Lang could not bear to have their daughter, who had only returned recently, leave for the far-off Taiyuan Valley. But for Ye Qingtang’s sake, they packed her things.

After a few days in the Jiang House, Jiang Yu led Ye Qingtang and the Inner Sect Elder, and they headed for Taiyuan Valley.
