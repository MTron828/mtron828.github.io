Chapter 2473: Return of the Emperor (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

On top of the statues were a group of girls and boys who were staring at them blankly.

“Humans… No, where are you all from? How dare you disrespect the Yongle tribe!”

Han looked at the group sitting on the statues in anger. The human skins on these demons were rather beautiful, but there were two who were older and their skins were slightly ugly.

“How dare you!”

Ye Qingtang’s cold gaze swept across the two of them. “Children of Yongle, how dare you not show your respects to us.”

As soon as the words were out of her mouth, Han and Gu’s expressions changed completely. They looked at each other as they recalled what had just happened.

Children of Yongle… not showing their respects…

“You… you are….may I ask…” Gu looked at Ye Qingtang and asked with a scowl.

“How dare you!” Ye Qingtang said coldly.

“Hiss!”

As soon as she said that, Han and Gu shrunk away and gasped.

The miracle that they had just witnessed…

Gu and Han looked subconsciously at the elder on top of the statue of the Yongle demon emperor. The elder seemed to have an other-worldly air to him.

“Then… what about the miracle we just witnessed?” Han’s voice was shaking.

Hearing the word ‘miracle’, Ye Qingtang silently heaved a sigh of relief. She was afraid that the demons would not be wishing for the return of the demon emperor. If that was the case, they would be in big trouble.

But it seemed like she had worried too much.

The Yongle tribe’s faith was the strongest in this place.

“Since you already witnessed the miracle, worship us immediately!”

Lu Yuanxiang, who was at the side, spoke furiously. His voice was mixed with magic and it was easy to get caught up in it if someone was not careful.

Ye Qingtang glanced at him. He was smart to have started using his magic.

“Gu… is this real, or am I dreaming?” Han hadn’t regained his senses yet.

Gu was already kneeling on the ground in excitement.

Seeing this, Han’s mind cleared and he quickly knelt as well. There was no other explanation other than the fact that the Yongle Demon Emperor was back.

“Who is the general of the Yongle tribe now?” the Flying Star Academy teacher, who had been silent till now, said lightly.

“It… it’s Zang!” Han didn’t dare lie.

“Bring him here. I want to meet him alone.” The Flying Star Academy teacher shut his eyes after saying this.

“What are you waiting for?” Qin Feng said coldly.

“Yes… yes yes yes!”

Han nodded profusely and retreated with a bow, shutting the door to the ancestral hall. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The two demons didn’t say a single word after leaving the ancestral hall and quickly ran towards the headquarters of the Yongle tribe.

Ye Qingtang only sighed with relief after Han and Gu left.

“I thought I was going to die of fear!”

There was a sheen of cold sweat on the Flying Star Academy teacher’s forehead. How was this something that a human could do?

Lu Yuanxiang was shocked as well. He had lived for a long time but this was the first time he was encountering such a situation.

“Yun Chen, continue leaving the powder at the door,” Ye Qingtang instructed.

Wasting no time, Yun Chen quickly did as asked.

Fortunately for them, the demons in this space had never heard of such an elixir before which could make them hallucinate. Otherwise, they would not have been tricked so easily.

But Zang was the Yongle tribe general and would be more cautious.. They had to get him in one shot and leave no room for suspicion.
