Chapter 577 Danger (1)

After searching a few houses and not finding anything, Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder waited until dawn and left.

There was not much difference between the day and night in the small city. The blood-colored glint still enshrouded over the city irrespective of the time.

Throughout their journey, Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder were extremely cautious and were on their guard, deeply afraid that they would encounter that frightening Buddha statue again.

About an hour later, the two people finally stopped outside the city gates.

The human-consuming Buddha statue was right in the center of the city gates where they had to pass through. However, it had already turned into a statue.

“This…”

The Blood Moon Elder looked at Ye Qingtang rather uneasily.

Both of them had already witnessed the skills of that Buddha statue. Once it discovered them, it would be difficult for them to escape again.

Seeing that Ye Qingtang did not say anything, the Blood Moon Elder spoke. “Holy Lady… How about we take another route? Otherwise, if we alarm that evil creature, Pm afraid we will not have it easy.”

However, Ye Qingtang shook her head.

There was only this one exit to this blood-colored city. If they did not pass through here, she would still not be able to fly out of this city even if she used her Feather Formation Technique.

There were unknown laws of powers in this city which somehow restricted the ability for cultivators to be high up in the sky, and cultivators forced into the mystic realm could only travel by feet.

There was indeed a high risk in exiting the city. As the Blood Moon Elder said, if they alarmed the Buddha statue, the consequences would be dire.

However…

If they remained there, there were too many variables, and the dark night, especially, was extremely scary. Ye Qingtang did not dare to think whether even more frightening creatures would appear.

At present, the two of them only had one route, which was to take a risk and leave the city.

The risks were extremely high in the blood-colored city, and they could lose their lives in here anytime. Instead of that, why not risk their lives and take a chance?

“Go.”

Ye Qingtang looked at the Blood Moon Elder and walked forward in great strides right after.

Seeing that Ye Qingtang was so decisive, the Blood Moon Elder could only pull a long face and follow behind Ye Qingtang.

When both of them passed by the Buddha statue, they deliberately slowed their breathing and walked lightly, afraid that a slight rough action would awaken the Buddha statue.

They were still ten meters away from the border of the city.

“Sleep longer. You must not wake up at this time…” The Blood Moon Elder’s eyes never left the Buddha statue.

At this instant, they were only less than five meters away from the border of the city.

Ye Qingtang held her breath. Every step was like eons.

Three meters… Two meters… One meter…

Seeing the mountain valley outside the town, Ye Qingtang finally heaved a sigh in relief.

“Holy Lady, this Buddha… is looking at us!” Suddenly, the Blood Moon Elder shouted in surprise.

After hearing the Blood Moon Elder, Ye Qingtang instinctively looked behind her. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

However, this action caused her to directly meet the eyes of the Buddha statue.

The eyeballs of the Buddha statue slowly turned. A hint of banter emerged in that pair of angry eyes.

Immediately, the Buddha statue let out a burst of sinister laughter that struck terror in hearts.

In the next second, the Buddha statue raised the vajra in its hands and fiercely smashed it towards the two people.

“Run!”

Ye Qingtang’s expression changed. Without thinking, Ye Qingtang grabbed the Blood Moon Elder almost instinctively and sprinted out of the city.

Boom!

The vajra caused the ground where both of them were standing at previously to be smashed into pieces.

Even though they were only one meter away, they almost lost their lives.
