Chapter 2034: Chaos (2)

Ye Qingtang wanted to look for Mi but bumped into Ling Yan as she walked out of the door.

“Do you need something from me?” she asked.

Ling Yan brushed past her and said, “Will Miss Ye take me somewhere?”

“Now?” Ye Qingtang was slightly shocked.

“That’s right. Now.”

“Where?” Ye Qingtang knew that he wouldn’t ask her to bring him somewhere if there wasn’t something going on. There had to be some special reason for this.

“The Hall of Gloom,” he said.

Hall of Gloom?

Ye Qingtang was taken aback. That place didn’t hold any good memories for her.

“Why do you want to go there?”

“You’ll understand once you go,” Ling Yan said with a smile, clearly not at all in a rush to reveal the answer.

Ye Qingtang glared at him. She really wanted to smack him sometimes. But she wasted no time and brought him to the Hall of Gloom immediately.

The Hall of Gloom was shrouded in darkness, with only a single lamp lighting it.

“Why did you want to come here?” Ye Qingtang looked at Ling Yan. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Could Miss Ye please open the Pagoda of the Dead for me?”

“...” Ye Qingtang kept silent.

What exactly did Ling Yan have up his sleeves?

She had no idea what Ling Yan was thinking of doing but flew up to retrieve the lamp.

The Hall of Gloom suddenly started shaking as she took the lamp.

With a mighty quake, black fumes of death suddenly spurted out from the huge skeleton’s mouth that was carved on the ground. The endless fumes of death entwined to form a mirage of the Pagoda of the Dead. An altar suddenly appeared at the top of the pagoda.

“I see Miss Ye is already familiar with everything in the Temple of Shadows.” Ling Yan smiled as he saw how Ye Qingtang opened the Pagoda of the Dead so easily.

Her mouth twitched.

How could she not be familiar?

She had a deep impression of the first time Lady Ghost had opened the Pagoda of the Dead.

“What do you want to do? You’re not asking me to pay respects to the dead now, right?”

“Of course not. Miss Ye, please follow me into the pagoda.” Without revealing much, Ling Yan continued into the pagoda.

Annoyed, she grabbed Ling Yan’s wrist and flew up to the top of the Pagoda of the Dead.

“Miss Ye is so powerful,” Ling Yan said with a laugh.

She felt like killing him right now.

“If you’re not going to tell me what you plan on doing, I’m afraid I won’t be able to control myself anymore.”

She would end him with a slap.

“Miss Ye, you have some unique interests. It’s way too cold here but you can lose control all you want when we’re in your room,” Ling Yan said with a smile.

Ye Qingtang was speechless.

Would it be too late if she threw him down now?

Sensing her murderous intent, he quickly changed the topic and looked at the altar on top of the pagoda.

Many years had passed since people last visited the altar and it was covered in gray dust. Ling Yan raised his hands to brush it off. After he wiped the dust off, she realized that there was a circle on top of the altar with inscriptions of the Undead Clan around it.

Ye Qingtang had been in a hurry the first time she had been there and had not noticed the inscriptions.

“What’s this?” she asked in curiosity.
