Chapter 2243: Fiendcelestial’s Will (2)

The leaders of the factions exchanged dubious looks.

They did not completely believe in the identity of this black-robed person.

No one had ever heard of this black-robed person in the Evil Soul Forest, but she had suddenly appeared today. The major factions were no fools and naturally would not believe everything she said just like that.

But no one revealed any of their doubts.

“Elder Feng, do you think that person is serious?”

In response, Elder Feng from Falling Water Pavilion said, “For the moment, we cannot confirm if she is serious. But since she said that she is here waiting for the fated person, let us see how things develop first.”

For now, it was true that they were unable to open the door to the fiendcelestial’s tomb. If this black-robed person was serious, then she would know how to open it.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

As for the rest of her claims, there was no way they would just believe everything she said. The leaders of the various factions all had this line of thinking. But as for the matter concerning the inheritance of the fiendcelestial’s will, everyone had their own guesses and theories.

But they would lay low for now and see if this black-robed person had any tricks up her sleeve.

“I wonder how it is possible to determine who the fated person is?” The demon child’s voice rang out from the carriage. His tone was calm with hints of probing.

“This person will be personally chosen by the fiendcelestial’s will,” Ye Qingtang replied steadily.

“How will he be chosen?”

The crowd was very curious.

Ye Qingtang was in no hurry. She knew that these people were still dubious about her words, but...

As long as they wanted to enter the fiendcelestial’s tomb, she was confident in hoodwinking them.

“The fiendcelestial’s will mainly exists in the tomb. You just need to enter it. The suitable person will naturally be chosen. I am only the guide.” Ye Qingtang spoke in a mild tone.

Everyone couldn’t help being stunned by Ye Qingtang’s words...

“Since you are the guide, I wonder if you can guide us into the tomb?” The demon child asked.

The current obstacle was that they were unable to open that stone door.

This question was a test of this black-robed person’s identity.

“Of course.” Ye Qingtang didn’t hesitate. She urged the Night Soul Beast toward the stone door.

The crowd looked at Ye Qingtang with complicated expressions. With narrowed eyes, the demon child carefully analyzed Ye Qingtang’s every move. The faction leaders quietly all went on high alert.

This black-robed person’s appearance was too bizarre. They had never heard of her claims and so they did not dare to believe her declaration.

Ye Qingtang could clearly feel countless pairs of eyes fixed upon her back.

Leaping off the Night Soul Beast’s back, she stood in front of the stone door.

The fiendcelestial’s tomb entrance was very strange. In her previous life, people took 50 years after the discovery of the tomb to finally open the door, which had been sealed for eons.

In her previous life, this stone door had stumped the Second Domain factions for a full 50 years.

Ye Qingtang looked at the stone door before her, recalling her memories from her previous life. Quietly, she took a deep breath and shot a look at the Night Soul Beast.

The Night Soul Beast felt very frustrated but had no choice but to comply.

It was the only Night Soul Beast who was awake. On its own, it could not defeat the wild ambitions of the major factions. As such, it had no choice but to cooperate with Ye Qingtang.

Using its body to cover what it was doing, the Night Soul Beast secretly reached out one feeler.
