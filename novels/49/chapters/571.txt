Chapter 572 Hell of Avicinaraka (3)

The Blood Sect Elder had entered quite a number of mystic realms before but had never heard of Xuanling Sect’s Hundred Level Peril Hell of Avicinaraka. In addition, his skills were also insufficient, and he had no solutions to speak of.

Ye Qingtang was also unclear of what they should do now. The development of events had surpassed her predictions by a far lot and was headed towards an uncontrollable stage.

Currently, Ye Qingtang hoped for neither destinies nor the Black Heaven Water.

She only hoped… to be able to protect her own life!

“We’ll take one step at a time. Once a mystic realm starts, it will sustain for about half a month. As long as we can bear through half a month, we can leave,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Since that’s the case.” The Blood Moon Elder scanned the strange buildings in their surroundings and said, “Holy Lady, let’s just find a random house in this city and live in it. It’s only half a month. It will pass in the blink of an eye.”

Ye Qingtang pinched her glabella upon hearing him. Why did such an idiot appear by her side…

This was a Hundred Level Peril mystic realm. How could one be able to survive just by hiding!

If they really did what the Blood Moon Elder said, both of them would probably not live more than half a month.

After seeing Ye Qingtang’s unfathomable expression, the Blood Moon Elder was just about to defend himself, but strange noises sounded from the central square.

From what they saw, the strange sounds came from the solemn Buddha statue.

As Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder took a close look, that Buddha statue suddenly opened a pair of angry eyes.

Right on the heels of that, a creepy sight appeared.

The Buddha statue moved its vajra, and in the next second, the skull of that Lingyun Sect elder was in its hands. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

It glared at the skull furiously for a few seconds and subsequently tossed that skull into its mouth without any hesitation, slowly chewing it.

Luckily, the people who experienced this were Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder. One of them was a mighty Paragon in her past life while the other was an elder of the evil Blood Moon Sect. If it were others, they would have been so horrified to the point that their souls left their bodies or that they could even spit out their gallbladder.

The freakish chewing sound was mixed with the sound of crushed bones. Stale blood slowly seeped out of the Buddha statue’s mouth

In the next second, the pair of enraged eyes suddenly looked towards Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder.

Roar!!

A horrifying roar exploded from its mouth.

Ye Qingtang could even faintly see the minced flesh and hair between the gaps of the Buddha statue’s teeth…

Hiss!

Ye Qingtang gasped immediately.

“Run!”

Ye Qingtang fled without saying any other nonsense.

The Buddha statue exuded a strange air which was extremely frightening. If she fought, it was without a doubt that she would die.

“Holy Lady… What’s so scary about this? It’s just an evil creature. In my peak thousands of years ago, evil creatures like this did not dare to be so impudent before me!”

Pride filled the Blood Moon Elder’s face. He just spoke but realized that Ye Qingtang had already escaped without a trace.

Roar!!!

Instantly, the Buddha statue’s furious eyes landed on the Blood Moon Elder.

“Holy Lady… Wait for me, Holy Lady!!”

After being sized up by the Buddha statue, the Blood Moon Elder fled without uttering any more crap.

Although he did not lie, that was a thousand years ago after all. Currently, it was still more dependable to be more realistic….

However…

The sinister laughter of the Buddha statue reverberated throughout the entire small city like a demonic voice that was impossible to get rid of.

Every nook and cranny seemed to have that terrifying sinister laughter that caused one’s scalp to tingle.
