Chapter 810 Blade (2)

Upon hearing that, Master Du was slightly stunned and had a look of surprise.

He originally thought that he still needed to convince her.

Unexpectedly…

Ye Qingtang agreed just like this.

“Great. Brother Ye Chen is indeed a straightforward person.” After gaining Ye Qingtang’s agreement, Master Du chuckled as his eyes twinkled with excitement.

The trip to the Dragon Vein which he had been planning for over ten years could finally be realized today…

“However, we still have to make a good plan.” Master Du sighed before saying with a serious expression.

Ye Qingtang was not in a hurry over that.

In these two days, Ye Qingtang remained in the Bliss Forging Workshop and discussed the details of the plan with Master Du.

However, Ye Qingtang realized that the little white tiger disappeared from the Bliss Forging Workshop unknowingly. She searched for a long time but still could not find it, and only a silver wolf with ferocious eyes remained.

What is wrong with Xiao Guai recently?!

The same time at the northern mainland.

Screams and roars of demonic beasts echoed in an ethereal valley.

“What the f*ck. Get the hell away. I’ll pull out your skin if you make a noise again!” The little white tiger hollered angrily.

Along with the little white tiger’s roar, the valley fell into a dead silence.

“What the f*ck. You’re only coming now…”

The little white tiger mumbled and sprinted towards the valley ahead.

Thousands of meters away in a thatched house by a stream.

A gray-haired elderly was holding onto a fishing rod and fishing by the stream.

“What the f*ck… Grandson, grandfather is here!” The little white tiger shouted at the white-bearded elderly who was fishing by the stream.

“Hush… Keep quiet.” The white-bearded elderly looked at the little white tiger and shook his head, instructing the little white tiger to not make so much noise.

The moment he finished speaking, the white-bearded elderly flicked his wrist and lifted the fishing rod immediately, pulling a patterned fish out from the stream.

With a face full of smiles, the white-bearded elderly removed the fish from the fishing rod and handed it to the little white tiger. “It’s been a long time. Meeting gift.”

“What the f*ck… Meeting gift?” The little white tiger stared at the patterned fish which was still alive and flopping about at its feet. “Are… are you serious?”

“Why? You don’t like it?” The white-bearded elderly chuckled. “This fish is called Jue Li. It’s materialized by the condensation of the Heavenly Cycle and is a condensation of a certain energy body.”

The little white tiger was stunned after hearing the white-bearded elderly and immediately swallowed the patterned fish without uttering a word further.

“What the f*ck. Why are you so polite… We are so familiar already. Why did you give me such an expensive present…” After consuming the patterned fish, it evidently felt the energy in its body increase extensively, giving it the capital to save its life.

The white-bearded elderly did not respond and stood up to store his fishing rod away.

“What the f*ck… This is strange. Are you human or not?” The little white tiger sized up the white-bearded elderly curiously.

“Why did you say that?” The white-bearded elderly sat down once again and asked with a smile. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“I’ve never seen anyone who can live for as long as you…” The little white tiger muttered.

Not long after it was born, it was acquainted with this white-bearded elderly. It had lived for thousands of years, yet this white-bearded elderly was still not dead.

“It does not matter how long one lives… Rather, has what I once told you about come true?” The white-bearded elderly looked at the little white tiger meaningfully.

Immediately, the little white tiger’s expression turned slightly solemn as it replied. “Your words indeed came true… That lady…”

“To save your father, your mother… your clan, you can only rely on her. However, she cannot do without your help in death tribulations after death tribulations,” the white-bearded elderly said with a smile.
