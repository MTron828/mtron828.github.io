Chapter 1756: Encampment (2)

Ye Qingtang nodded silently. Little White Tiger recognized the situation as well and didn’t refute this. If he said anything different, they would definitely be massacred and devoured!

The fiendish demon was extremely fast. Even on foot, his speed was much faster than Ye Qingtang when she was flying.

Even after spending many days in this valley, Ye Qingtang was still quite clueless about it. Even though she had figured a few things out, it mostly still didn’t make sense to her and she could only find out more carefully from this fiendish demon.

The fiendish demon didn’t suspect much as well and only thought they were clueless little demons that had just been born. There was no other reason why they would have been dumb enough to wander into the enemy territory to seek their death. He started explaining everything to them. Ye Qingtang gradually began to understand more about the valley as the fiendish demon explained to her. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

In this valley, fiendish demons existed in the largest number. As for the other monsters, apart from a few fierce ones that even the demons didn’t dare provoke easily, the others were all either their slaves or their food.

The demons here didn’t all belong to one group, the powerful demons were split into different camps. Even though they were of the same race, they fought daily to gain territory. The eastern camp was just one of the many groups of demons. There were more than ten other teams in the valley, small and large, and they were all different.

They had absolutely no mercy for demons of the other camps. As long as the demons found them, they would do whatever they could to kill them then devour their bodies to strengthen themselves.

The demon said all of this with a little impatience. All she had to do was stay put and not run around on her own or no one would even know how she died.

Ye Qingtang could only take his scoldings silently as she began to worry.

Who knew if her disguise would hold up if she was brought to the demon camp.

After a whole day’s journey, they passed through a forest and were brought straight into the depths of the valley. But in a second, Ye Qingtang was surrounded by countless demons.

The demons all gathered together, filling the valley with a thick demonic aura. Ye Qingtang spotted a few other creatures but they were all chained-up slaves working fearfully for the demons.

The moment the demon carrying Ye Qingtang landed, he threw her aside.

Demons from the cave swarmed over to greet the demon that had just returned. Some of them noticed Ye Qingtang who had been thrown to the side and started sniffing them subconsciously.

Ye Qingtang felt her hairs stand up but maintained her neutral expression. Soon enough, the demons lost interest as they smelled a familiar smell on Ye Qingtang.

“What happened? Didn’t the General send you to the Western camp to check out the situation there? Why are you back so fast?”

The fiendish demon in the man’s skin grimaced as he looked at Ye Qingtang in disgust. “It’s done. I’ll report back to the General later. This little rascal ran into the western territory herself. She would’ve died and been devoured by the demons from the western camp if I hadn’t been there.”

Hearing this, the demons all turned to look at Ye Qingtang. They laughed as they saw the skin she was in.

“This little rascal has a pretty good skin. Where did you find this two-legged lamb? Take it off and let me try it someday,” one of the demons said with a laugh.

‘Two legged lambs’ were what the demons called the humans.

Ye Qingtang was speechless. How could she possibly lend them her skin!
