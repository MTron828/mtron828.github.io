Ye Qingtang’s mind was blown on seeing those fiendish demons.

They were definitely not from the eastern faction!

“Damn, so many...” Little White Tiger was dumbstruck by the sight of those demons.

Ye Qingtang would be no match against even a single little fiendish demon, but she was now faced with eight adults. She quickly picked up Little White Tiger and little Heavenly Demon and turned to run in the opposite direction. All thoughts about washing off the demon blood on her had fled out the window.

At a time like this, Ye Qingtang didn’t dare to hesitate for even a second. She never expected to encounter demons from other factions so close to the eastern fiendish demon camp.

If these fiendish demons had appeared just a little later, Ye Qingtang might have already washed away the demon scent and gained a better chance at escaping. But now... the demon blood smeared all over her made her one big, giant target. Those fiendish demons just had to track her by that demon scent.

The demons were way faster than Ye Qingtang and instantly caught up with her.

Was she going to die now?

Ye Qingtang’s heart had leaped right up to the back of her throat. Her scalp went numb as she surveyed the eight fiendish demons surrounding her.

But just as Ye Qingtang was scared stiff, numerous black figures scurried out from the nearby undergrowth. They gathered around Ye Qingtang.

“Great Sage!”

Ye Qingtang saw that it was the group of eastern little fiendish demons whom she had diverted away. Those little demons were very scared but they didn’t run away. They stood before Ye Qingtang and revealed their sharp claws, glaring vigilantly at the eight adult fiendish demons.

Those little fiendish demons had scouted the area according to Ye Qingtang’s instructions. They had initially felt it was a redundant action as no enemy demons would dare to come near their camp. Nevertheless, they still did it as Ye Qingtang had commanded it.

But unexpectedly, they had detected the scent of other demons during their scouting. Several of them had even been attacked. At this moment, they finally realized that the enemy had already invaded the area surrounding their camp.

There were over a dozen little fiendish demons but they were not fully-grown and no match at all for those eight adults.

As a result, the shadow of death that enveloped Ye Qingtang’s heart did not completely dissipate. The eight adult fiendish demons didn’t show any signs of fear when those little demons appeared. Instead, their faces took on a greedy expression.

Ye Qingtang and those little demons were like a bunch of tasty lambs all ready for slaughter.

The direness of the situation made Ye Qingtang break out in cold sweat. She instinctively looked down at Little Heavenly Demon. Being surrounded by eight adult fiendish demons, it was near-impossible for her escape. Her only hope was Little Heavenly Demon but it remained deep in slumber.

“Great Sage, hurry up and leave. Go tell the other Great Sages that we are under enemy attack.” One of the little fiendish demons suppressed its own fear as it muttered in a low voice.

Ye Qingtang was stunned. She could clearly see how scared these little fiendish demons were of the adults. Nevertheless, they didn’t flee but chose to soldier on.

However...

Ye Qingtang wouldn’t be able to flee even if she wanted to. Those eight adult fiendish demons would never let a single one of them escape.

“Leave? Not so easy...” One of the adult fiendish demons revealed its sharp fangs as it narrowed its eyes at Ye Qingtang and the little fiendish demons.
