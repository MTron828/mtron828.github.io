Chapter 2286: Where Did The Energy Go? (1)

“Boss, how long have we been cultivating?” The group looked at Ye Qing.

They were worried that she would say three to five years…

Ye Qingtang was amused. “Don’t worry, not that long. You have been cultivating here for just over a month.”

“What? Over a month?” The group was shocked.

Was this a joke?

This was even more unbelievable than if he had told them they had been cultivating for three to five years.

Just over a month and it was enough to make this group of Paragon Ninth Heaven level people surge right up to Divine Lord level?

Was he joking?

“Snap out of it. It’s about time to return to the academy,” Ye Qing reminded them.

Ye Qingtang was not entirely sure when the Netherworld Academy would select their candidates. It was safer to return earlier.

The teenagers had yet to fully recover from their shock and joy. Still in a daze, they followed Ye Qing out of the secret room and out of the exit.

The Night Soul Beast instinctively prepared to follow suit. But right before stepping out, Ye Qingtang suddenly stopped.

The Night Soul Beast stared vigilantly at this cunning human.

“I am leaving. Thank you for your help during this period of time.” Ye Qingtang gave a slight smile. As the Night Soul Beast looked on in puzzlement, she released it from their contract.

The Night Soul Beast was utterly shocked.

“There are so many traps in the tomb, plus there is that black snake and your fellow Night Soul Beasts standing guard inside. It should be very safe. We will meet again in the future if fate allows it.” Ye Qingtang waved at the Night Soul Beast and stepped out of the exit.

A strange expression crossed the face of the Night Soul Beast as it watched Ye Qingtang’s departing profile.

…

After Ye Qingtang and the group emerged, they headed straight toward the periphery of the Evil Soul Forest. Before leaving, Ye Qingtang noticed that the main door to the fiendcelestial’s tomb was now shut. Many factions were gathered outside trying to figure out how to open it.

Ye Qingtang did not know when the main door was shut but she had no time to bother about it.

It was good that they couldn’t enter. At least they could keep their own lives.

Soon after, Ye Qingtang led those newly-improved brats out of the Evil Soul Forest.

For the time being, she had no plans to continue messing around with the dangerous fiendcelestial’s tomb. The various factions were unable to open the main door and wasted a lot of time outside the tomb.

The sky gradually darkened but they still had not figured out how to open it. They had no choice but to set up camp inside the Evil Soul Forest, and continue thinking of ways the next day.

An old man floated over in the sky during the night. He was one of the two men who had visited the tomb earlier.

But the elder with the mask was not there.

The stoop-backed old man scanned the various factions who were in the forest. Hidden by the darkness of the night, he flew over to the mountain peak above the tomb.

“It has been over two months. The demon pearl should have absorbed quite a bit of energy…” The old man spoke in a low voice. Lifting his hand, a gust of black air shot toward the mountain. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

In the next second, the black ball which had been floating in the secret room flew out of the mountain peak and landed in the old man’s hands.

With a smile, the old man sent a probing energy into the demon pearl. But he was stunned by what he discovered.

“What happened? Why is the energy inside the demon pearl so weak?”

The old man frowned deeply. Countless people from the various factions had entered the fiendcelestial’s tomb over the past two months. At least several hundred thousands of them had died inside the tomb, including a fearsome Emperor level practitioner.

How could this be?
