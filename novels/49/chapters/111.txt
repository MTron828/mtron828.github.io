“This is bad!!” Within the sect, the four faction elders, who were watching the sword array assessment, suddenly stood up upon seeing the blinding red light. Expressions of shock were etched on their faces.

“What’s going on? Why is there a sudden change to the sword array?” Elder Qin’s expression was the ugliest. A sky full of red light fell on the ground like raindrops with a speed so fast that one was unable to catch. Under an attack of such a level, a young girl would definitely be unable to block them even if she was a born genius.

Similarly, Elder Lin had a look of shock. The sword array was the first segment of Xuanling Sect’s entrance assessment and had been in use for hundreds of years without any errors.

But then, such an abnormality happened before his eyes.

For normal assessments, the sword array had been weakened a lot, and even if candidates were injured, they were merely minor abrasions. The sword array would definitely not take their lives.

However, before their eyes…

The light sabers would only turn red when fighting against enemies. The sword array then was no longer the sword array that the candidates had experienced. This was the real absolute-kill sword array! As long as one was attacked, one would definitely lose their life!

For a moment, Elder Lin’s face darkened as well. Even if he did not like how Elder Qin thought so highly of Ye Qingtang, he did not want the sword array to have any abnormality at this instant.

The Sword Faction was responsible for preparing this sword array!

“Elder Lin! What exactly is going on?” Elder Win asked with furrowed brows.

Elder Lin’s expression was very ugly. Without explaining further to Elder Qin, he directly reached for the psychic tablet and ordered the middle-aged man beside the Eight Trigrams Stage.

“Turn the sword array off immediately!”

If they were any later, Ye Qingtang might lose her life on the Eight Trigrams Stage!

Upon receiving the news, the middle-aged man beside the Eight Trigrams Stage was very anxious. He tried to shut the sword array down again but was repelled away by the force once again.

“Elder Lin, this sword array… cannot be turned off!!” the middle-aged man said hurriedly.

Elder Lin’s face darkened further.

The sword array cannot be turned off?

How could it be?

Just when everyone was surprised over the sudden change in the sword array, Ye Qingtang, who was standing on the Eight Trigrams Stage, faced her first crisis since her rebirth.

Light sabers pierced down one after another at a speed as fast as lightning. Ye Qingtang sensed a strong overbearing force flowing out continuously from the sword in the stone. She could not care about any other thing and could only lift her sword in the shortest time possible.

With a quick flick of her wrist, she made a series of strokes and drew a circle with her sword. Spinning around quickly, it was as though that flash of sword became a silver shield, reflecting away all the light sabers that were flying down towards her.

Suddenly, a loud clang rang!

The descending light sabers clashed against those that were hit away, turning the sky above the Eight Trigrams Stage into a sea of red. The clashing sound was as loud as the sound of the explosion of a massive rock.

Ye Qingtang back-stepped quickly with clever footsteps which were rapid yet orderly, fast, and steady. Accompanying with the dancing sword in her hands, she actually blocked the shower of light sabers!

All of this fell into the eyes of the four faction elders.

Originally shocked over the sudden change in the sword array, they were completely stunned after witnessing Ye Qingtang’s actions.

“This girl… actually blocked them?!” Elder Qin’s eyes widened suddenly, completely in disbelief over what he saw. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The absolute-kill sword array could defeat millions of enemies. How could it be blocked by a candidate who has not even entered the sect?
