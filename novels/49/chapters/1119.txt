Chapter 1120 Kill 1

The black-robed elderlies were in the Arcane Supremacy realm in Central Mainland, but after coming to this mainland, their current martial skill realm was around Yin Yang Perfected Lord Sixth Heaven, and they were definitely no match for Ye Qingtang, a Yin Yang Perfected Lord Eighth Heaven.

In just a few rounds, two black-robed elderlies were already killed by Ye Qingtang.

These condescending ancient clan figures would not have thought that they would ultimately die in the hands of a small Yang Lord when they merely invaded a low-level mainland.

“Anyone who kills or injures a member of the You Ancient Clan… must face dire consequences. You will be banished to the underworld and be suppressed for eternity!”

One of the black-robed elderlies glared at Ye Qingtang furiously.

“Killing one is a crime while slaying a hundred is considered heroic. After I kill everyone from your You Ancient Clan, who else can banish me to the underworld?” Ye Qingtang’s eyes flickered as she spoke. It was as though the surrounding air froze.

The Shenchao Sect disciples and senior executives were extremely agitated and cheered continuously.

“Hahaha. Did they really think that our mainland does not have anyone powerful… These invaders are so arrogant in our land, but aren’t they still going to be killed by a Yang Lord in the end!”

“Long live, Yang Lord! Kill all these bastards!”

“Yang Lord, after these bastards came to the north, they exterminated every being and killed all the citizens in Sky Star City…”

Many Shenchao Sect senior executives shouted.

“How hateful…”

The remaining black-robed elderlies gritted their teeth. If they were in the outside world, this bullshit Yang Lord would be easily killed by the impact of their auras!

“If only our battleships carrying our water supply were not exploded by someone…”

A black-robed elderly’s expression was extremely grim.

They originally prepared sufficient food and water when they came from Central Mainland to this low-level mainland.

However, halfway throughout their journey, their battleships storing water suddenly exploded for some reason. Afterward, the You Ancient Clan gathered water from nearby, but unexpectedly, almost all the water sources were poisoned. As such, after entering this mainland, their martial realms were severely suppressed and returned very slowly.

The Blood Moon Elder who had been following Ye Qingtang heard her bold words and was encouraged. He immediately walked forward and scoffed at the You Ancient Clan people.

“You need to pay a corresponding price for doing evil on our mainland!”He could not lose his Blood Moon Sect demeanor before his Holy Lady.

Just as the Blood Moon Elder was about to speak, Ye Qingtang had already turned into a flash of shadow and charged towards the remaining black-robed men.

Currently, the black-robed men who were only at Yin Yang Perfected Lord Sixth Heaven realm could not block Ye Qingtang’s attack. In ten or so breaths, the powerful figures who were at the Arcane Supremacy realm in the outside world were all killed by Ye Qingtang.

As for the You Ancient Clan disciples, Ye Qingtang did not let them off either and slaughtered all of them in Shenchao Sect.

“Thank you Yang Lord… Shenchao Sect will never forget your great kindness!”

Shenchao Sect Grand Elder walked forward immediately and bowed to Ye Qingtang gratefully.

Before Shenchao Sect Grand Elder’s knee touched the ground, Ye Qingtang walked forward and helped the Shenchao Sect Grand Elder up.

“This is our home. Now that our home is facing a calamity, how can we sit idly and not do anything?”Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m
