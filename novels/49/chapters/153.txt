Chapter 154: Fire-Resistant Soft Amour (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Once Su Wan returned to the room, she smelled a faint sour smell. With a frown, her eyes followed the direction of the smell where she ended up looking at where Ye Qingtang was.

Although the living quarters for the three people were all in one room, they were separated by a screen and thus Su Wan could only see Ye Qingtang’s shadow and not what she was busy with. Su Wan’s face turned ugly as she covered her nose.

“What smell is this. It’s so stinky.”

Su Wan’s complaints traveled into Ye Qingtang’s ears, and Ye Qingtang merely smiled lightly.

While the tannic acid had a rather sour smell, there was a fruity scent in it, and it did not smell bad and was even fresh-smelling.

Knowing that Su Wan was unhappy with her over Yun Shu, Ye Qingtang did not take her comment to heart.

She looked down at the wooden bucket where the translucent tannic acid had already turned brownish-red due to the soaked Fire Beast’s scales. Ye Qingtang used two long chopsticks to poke at it and realized that the scales had already softened. Then, she picked them up immediately.

After soaking in tannic acid for such a long time, the scales of the Fire Beast which was initially thick became unusually soft. Its texture was not as rough as before and felt soft like a slightly-thick piece of cotton instead.

Ye Qingtang wiped away the tannic acid on the scales, took out a pair of scissors, and immediately cut them before they hardened again. Afterward, she took out a special iron needle, threaded a fish glue thread through it, and began sewing nimbly.

Half a day passed just like that.

Ye Qingtang used the softened scales of the Fire Beast and made three pieces of fire-resistant soft armor.

Out of those three pieces of armor, she kept one for herself.

Then, she wrapped the other two and kept them aside.

This fire-resistant soft armor was very light and had good flexibility. There would be no discomfort for anyone and was very suitable to be worn on the body.

Although it was thin, the characteristics of the Fire Beast’s scale was fixed within the fire-resistant soft armor. Even if these three pieces of armor were thrown into a furnace and left to burn for three successive days, only the fish glue thread would be burnt at most, and the soft armor would definitely not be affected at all.

Ye Qingtang wore one of the three pieces of armor, and with outerwear, one could not tell any unusualness or plumpness.

As the weather was turning cold, wearing the fire-resistant soft armor even warmed the body.

After putting it on, Ye Qingtang immediately took another armor and headed out to find Yun Shu.

“This is… for me?” Yun Shu looked strangely at the dark red “vest” that Ye Qingtang handed to him.

He could not tell what material was that vest made of, but it felt warm to touch and was very magical.

“This thing is not too bad. If Senior Brother Yun doesn’t mind, wear it on your body on normal days,” Ye Qingtang said with a smile. She would naturally not forget about Yun Shu when she had something good; she owed him her life in her previous life. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Yun Shu took the fire-resistant soft armor in his hand and pursed his lips with a complicated expression in his eyes. He looked up at Ye Qingtang with a subtle expression.

Seeing that she had an upright look and no flirtatious intent in her eyes, Yun Shu really did not know how to react at the moment.

After staying silent for quite a while, Yun Shu finally replied rather stiffly, “Since it is Junior Sister Ye’s kindness, then I will… accept it. Thank you.”

“There’s no need to be polite with me,” Ye Qingtang said generously.

No one knew that the interaction between the two of them fell into the eyes of someone who passed by them not far away.
