Chapter 1096 Plunder (1)

“I see…”

Ye Qingtang mumbled after a long while.

There was a trace of the aura of the Tenth Heaven of Yin Yang Perfected Lord left in the boy’s hand.

Based on the aura, Ye Qingtang discovered that there was a sealed vein deep in the dantian. It seemed like a huge iron door.

In order to enter the Ninth Heaven, or even the Tenth, one needed to open the iron door…

Ye Qingtang withdrew her hand after a long while. Her eyes were filled with complex emotions. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The aura of Tenth Heaven of Yin Yang Perfected Lord in the boy’s hand was exactly the same as the Luo Xue Demon King.

Ye Qingtang was very sure at this point that the boy was the Luo Xue Demon King that was dead. The girl should be the extraordinary lady You Yun.

“Mother…”

The boy was slightly grudging when Ye Qingtang pulled her hand back.

Ye Qingtang was stunned as the boy suddenly spoke. The baby just called her ‘mother?

“E-I…”

The boy suddenly laughed as Ye Qingtang spoke.

Before Ye Qingtang could say anything, both the boy and the girl seemed to be tired. They closed their eyes and fell asleep.

Ye Qingtang felt even more complicated.

She just confirmed that the Luo Xue Demon King was reborn as the little boy, and the powerful person that she admired in her previous life just called her mother?!

Ye Qingtang suddenly did not know how to react. But soon, her emotions faded, and she looked up into the sky. The giant blood-red eye was still there in mid-air.

Based on her calculations, the invaders from the second mainland were going to be here soon…

Ye Qingtang frowned with a heavy heart.

Another two days had passed.

The peace in the Falling Sky Valley only remained for a few days and was broken again today.

The hidden ancient clan appeared in the sky again. A few powerful people of the ancient clan sparkled as they saw the boy and the girl on the giant tree. All Peak Masters and disciples of Falling Sky Valley ran to the tree and protected the boy and the girl with their bodies.

One middle-aged man of the hidden ancient clan’s sight landed on the two children. A strange glint appeared in his eyes.

“The boy should be the reincarnation of Luo Xue Demon King. The girl… should be where the power of the Spiritual Abode comes from. We can achieve anything if we can get the

girl.”

There were three Yin Yang Perfected Lords who were at the Tenth Heaven in the hidden ancient clan. All of them were killed by the Luo Xue Demon King. Now, there were no more Tenth Heaven Yin Yang Perfected Lords in the ancient clan anymore.

As long as they could get the girl, besides the Tenth Heaven, they could even break the curse of the mainland.

If they could consume her body, they could even get immortal life…

Suddenly, the aura of Eighth Heaven Yin Yang Perfected Lord surrounded the entire Falling Sky Valley. Everyone’s expression changed upon feeling the terrifying aura.

“We’ll spare your life if you hand over the boy and the girl to us.” One of the middle-aged men looked down at everyone in the Falling Sky Valley and said.

“Don’t even think about it!”

One of the Peak Master shouted coldly.

They were very sure that the boy was the reincarnation of their old Valley Master.
