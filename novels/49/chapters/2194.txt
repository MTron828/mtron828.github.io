The next morning, Jing Ze and the others came to the classroom to await Ye Qing’s arrival.

But to their surprise, Ye Qing was nowhere to be seen even after they waited for an entire afternoon.

Yun Chen also did not show up.

“Don’t tell me that Boss is still at the alchemy lab? Why does he need to go there to refine elixirs?” Lei Yan was puzzled.

“Perhaps Boss knows that with his current cultivation level, it would be too difficult for him to progress any further, and so he wants to change his occupation?” Nangong Lie stroked his chin as he guessed.

Their Boss appeared to be a few years older than them but his powers were not that great. In Nangong Lie’s opinion, Ye Qing would probably never be able to attain the Paragon level.

This kind of power in the Second Domain was not outstanding at all.

When Ye Qing failed to appear after they waited for the whole afternoon, they all went about their own cultivation.

After all...

They had to show their Boss some support and try not to affect his confidence.

The few of them believed that Ye Qing would give up after a couple of days. As a result, they didn’t mind. Apart from Qin Feng’s “diligent” gardening, the others went about their own cultivation.

But four to five days passed and they still saw no sign of Ye Qing.

By then, the group of kids could no longer sit still.

They snuck into the medicine faculty and came to Yun Chen’s alchemy lab.

Just as they were hesitating over who should knock on the door, Yun Chen came out carrying a stack of boxes. He looked puzzled at the sight of the restless teenagers.

“Why are you guys here?”

They immediately surrounded Yun Chen.

“Yun Chen, what have you and Boss been doing the past few days... What are you carrying?” Nangong Lie started to ask when his attention was attracted by those boxes in Yun Chen’s arms.

“Some medicinal herbs,” Yun Chen replied.

“Don’t you have a space ring? Why are you carrying them like this?” Nangong Lie was puzzled.

Yun Chen chuckled. “These medicinal herbs are very precious. They would lose their medicinal potency if I put them in the space ring.

“Boss... asked for these?” Lei Yan asked cautiously.

Yun Chen nodded.

The group exchanged looks.

They thought Ye Qing would stop this nonsense after a few days. But their teacher was still asking for more ingredients.

Their teacher was going all out to refine elixirs!

Previously, the abilities of Lei Yan and the rest had significantly improved under Ye Qing’s guidance. Over the past few days, as they cultivated on their own, they had encountered some problems but didn’t dare to disturb Ye Qing. Unable to wait any longer, they had no choice but to come here.

“I say, Yun Chen. Go and persuade Boss. It’s too late for him to start learning about medicine cultivation now...” Nangong Lie urged.

Lei Yan also nodded. “That’s right. Why does Boss insist on doing this? If he is able to groom me to greater heights, he can rely on the backing of my Leiting family in the future. There’s no need for him to put in so much effort in this... rather than wasting his time, he should teach me a few more moves.”

A waste of time...

Dumbfounded, Yun Chen stared at Lei Yan and the rest, the corners of his lips twitching. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

A waste of time? They were the ones who were wasting their time!

Lei Yan and the rest were so wily. They didn’t dare to approach Ye Qing themselves, and so they were trying to make him go and persuade Ye Qing instead.

“Yun Chen, even if you don’t care about us, you need to think for your own good. With Boss using your alchemy lab now, when else will you get the time to cultivate elixirs?” Nangong Lie continued his urging.
