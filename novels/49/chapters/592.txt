Chapter 593: The Palace (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Before Ye Qingtang could figure out what was going on, a horrifying voice came out from the mysterious palace.

A large amount of blood spurted out of the palace’s ground at the same time when the scream was heard.

The blood-red color filled everyone’s eyes. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Whiz!

A blood-colored shadow flew out of the palace suddenly.

Before Ye Qingtang and the rest could realize what just happened, the shadow landed in front of them.

“Help… help… help me…” A weak and desperate voice was heard.

The blood-colored shadow that landed in front of them was half of the body of a woman!

The woman was pretty, but her black hair was dyed red in the blood.

The woman only had the top half of her body. Her face was as pale as a sheet of paper. She dragged her body towards Ye Qingtang and the rest in despair with her hands.

As the woman moved inch by inch, sharp blood scars were left on the ground from her broken body…

The woman lay flat on the ground after moving a few meters. She died out of breath, and the blood dyed the entire ground under her body red.

Feng Cong and the rest of the ten people were shocked. Their faces were pale as they stared at the woman with only half of her body.

They had witnessed such a horrifying scene before they even entered the palace. It was totally impossible that the palace offered destinies! It must be a hell.

“Young Miss… I think… we should leave this place now!”

One of the Ouyang clan men’s had an extremely unpleasant expression.

As cultivators, they were not afraid of death in a real fight, but they were scared of death from unknown causes…

Feng Cong and a few others also had the feeling to escape. They did not want to remain at this place and definitely did not want to enter the palace.

The Blood Moon Elder looked at Ye Qingtang immediately. He did not want to stay at this place anymore, but he needed to wait for Ye Qingtang’s command.

“Leave!”

Ye Qingtang did not hesitate and was about to turn and leave.

Even the Great Elder of Yuehua Sect died here. No one knew what was waiting for them inside the palace. Once they entered, they would most likely die.

However, when everyone was just about to retreat, a thunder-like roar arose in front of them and spread out to their surroundings.

A large amount of sand suddenly condensed from the endless desert and became a demonic monster in front of everyone.

The demonic monster was formed by sand and was a few hundred meters tall. It was like an evil demon in the desert. Its body covered the sky and the sun, and it was surrounded by a sinister aura. A huge storm was formed from its roar.

Its eyes seemed to be able to enchant humans. One stare would result in falling into hell with no return.

“WHAT THE HELL!” One of the sect disciples cursed after seeing the monster.

How could they move around with such a monster blocking their way!

“This is a demonic monster formed from resentment.”

The Blood Moon Elder frowned and was deep in thought as he looked towards the demonic monster.

The so-called resentment was present in all living creatures. When they were alive, they were buried with huge resentment, and after their death, that resentment might morph into evil spirits.

Now, Ye Qingtang had to walk towards the palace as there was no way to retreat.
