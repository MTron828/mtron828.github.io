Chapter 2196: Can I Reject (2)

“Also, the medicine faculty’s monthly assessment is coming up, right? If you don’t hurry and...” Nangong Lie didn’t complete his sentence. His meaning was clear.

Yun Chen had a peculiar expression on his face.

“It is my honor that Teacher Ye is willing to use my alchemy lab.”

Nangong Lie and Lei Yan were completely stunned by Yun Chen’s words.

Nangong Lie: Damn, this guy is even better at boot-licking than me?

Lei Yan: Damn, this Yun Chen is even better at boot-licking than Nangong Lie?

Observing the reactions of the group, Yun Chen was trying to find a way to explain the situation when the lab doors were suddenly thrown open.

Standing in the doorway, Ye Qing immediately noticed Yun Chen and his armful of boxes. “Yun Chen, hurry up and bring the herbs inside.”

She needed them urgently.

Yun Chen snapped out of his trance. There was no time to explain now. He just ran into the lab with his boxes of precious medicinal ingredients.

After watching Yun Chen enter the alchemy lab, Ye Qingtang finally noticed the kids standing outside the door.

“Why are you all here?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Little Senior Sister misses you so we came with her to visit you.” Nangong Lie immediately shoved Mu Ziying to the front.

Mu Ziying: “...”

Was it too late for her to kill them now?

Ye Qingtang didn’t think too much and just said, “It’s perfect timing that you guys are here. I’ve just completed refining your elixirs. Come in.”

With that, Ye Qing turned back into the alchemy lab.

Different expressions flashed across the faces of the group when they heard that Ye Qing had refined some “elixirs” for them.

Jing Ze and Mu Ziying looked very grateful. They believed that Boss was indeed super nice to them, still thinking about them even during this period. On the contrary, Nangong Lie and Lei Yan appeared very conflicted.

“Boss refined elixirs for us?!” Nangong Lie glanced at Lei Yan.

Lei Yan swallowed hard. “If we take them... we won’t die... right?” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Meanwhile, Jing Ze and Mu Ziying had already entered the lab.

Nangong Lie frowned at the unexpected turn of events. He clutched his stomach. “Aiya, my stomach suddenly hurts. I need to go to the toilet!”

He turned to flee.

But before he could take more than a couple of steps, Lei Yan wrapped one arm around his neck and dragged him into the alchemy lab.

“Brother, we already made a pact that we would go through thick and thin together. You cannot just leave me behind.” Lei Yan took a deep breath. Lei Yan might be a bit more stupid compared to Nangong Lie’s slyness, but he was also a bit more loyal.

He believed that...

Ye Qing’s elixirs were probably no different from poison.

But looking at how Ye Qing had helped them, Lei Yan was determined to support her at all costs!

It was just taking poison!

He had quite a number of elixirs in his space ring. At the very most, he could just go back and eat some to neutralize the effects.

“Stop! Brother, let’s talk things through!” Nangong Lie struggled but was still dragged into the lab by Lei Yan.

Flames swirled within the tripod inside the alchemy lab. The entire lab was filled with the intense smell of herbs. It was slightly bitter but not at all pungent.

The interior of the lab was not as chaotic as Lei Yan and the rest expected. It was much cleaner than when they first saw it.

All the medicinal herbs had been sorted out into different containers. On the table, there were also batches of prepped ingredients and several white porcelain bottles.
