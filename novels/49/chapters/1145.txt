Chapter 1146: You Are Thinking Too Much (1)

“Even this can’t kill you?”

The Blood Moon Elder looked in disbelief at the golden-robed man with a perplexed expression.

The Blood Moon Elder currently had full confidence in the powers of his new body. Although his recent punch was not earth-shattering, it should have no problem crushing a few powerful cultivators. Further, the golden-robed man was caught off guard and received the full force of the blow!

However…

Who would have thought that this golden-robed man could still survive after receiving the full force of this blow!

“Elder Yin Fo… you… dare to betray… the You Clan?!” The golden-robed man said sternly to Blood Moon Elder with eyes completely devoid of expression.

When he heard the golden-robed man’s words, Blood Moon Elder’s expression immediately changed. He waved his hand repeatedly. “Lord General… you are mistaken… what happened just now was a misunderstanding… my blow was meant to crush that girl into dust… who knew that Lord General would rush over so swiftly… and block my fist…”

When he heard Blood Moon Elder’s nonsense, a cold light glittered in the golden-robed man’s eyes. “Are you… taking me for a fool?”

“No, no, Lord General. Even if I had the nerve, I would not dare to offend you. I would certainly not dare to betray the Ancient You Clan… If you don’t believe me, I can demonstrate again…” With that, Blood Moon Elder threw another punch without giving the golden-robed man any chance to react.

The golden-robed man would never have imagined that this “Elder Yin Fo” would actually throw another punch at him and was caught completely off guard. He was sent flying by the oncoming fist!

The Blood Moon Elder’s punch was extremely fast and instantly sent the golden-robed man flying.

A few hundred meters away, a mountain peak collapsed under the impact of the golden-robed man’s body.

This time, even Ye Qingtang, who was standing nearby, was completely bewildered, not to speak of the golden-robed man, who had been ambushed twice in rapid succession…

“Hahahaha, I’ve always said that with your brains, why are you the general… Brat, veterans always have the advantage. You are just too inexperienced. Haha!” The Blood Moon Elder burst out laughing. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

When she saw the Blood Moon Elder’s smug look, Ye Qingtang really wanted to go up and slap him.

Considering the terrifying strength that Blood Moon Elder’s current body possessed, the golden-robed man was completely within his control. He could curb the golden-robed man’s movements, and together with Ye Qingtang’s destructive black flame, the two of them working in tandem could certainly kill the golden-robed man on the spot…

However, the Blood Moon Elder had missed two wonderful opportunities…

Such great opportunities to kill the golden-robed old man, but the Blood Moon Elder had only… given him two punches…

“Hahahahaha!” Having succeeded twice, the Blood Moon Elder laughed loudly and turned to Ye Qingtang, his face filled with pride. In a smug tone, he loudly said, “Holy Lady, I think we have overestimated the general of the Ancient You Clan!”

When she heard the Blood Moon Elder’s words, Ye Qingtang could not help but rub her forehead. She wanted to say something but was interrupted by Blood Moon Elder. “Holy Lady, we don’t need to flee. If we work together, we can kill this general… No, in fact, we don’t need to work together. I myself can kill him!”

When Ye Qingtang looked at the smug Blood Moon Elder, she could not summon up even half a smile.

The situation was not as simple as the Blood Moon Elder had assumed…
