Chapter 1142: Giving One’s All In Acting (1)

“Aren’t the two of you too dizzy with success?”

All of a sudden, the little white tiger poked its head out from Ye Qingtang’s arms and said, “Don’t forget that the ten cities are connected. With the fall of Wind Cloud City and Sky Stars City, the You Ancient Clan will definitely be alarmed!”

Ye Qingtang’s brows furrowed suddenly when she heard the little white tiger.

Ye Qingtang was surprised by the appearance of Blood Moon Holy Lord and Han Cangming, and she had forgotten about this issue…

Ye Qingtang took a look at the Blood Moon Elder and then turned around and walked out of the city.

However, before she could walk far, a cold voice suddenly filled the entire Wind Cloud City.

Ye Qingtang looked in the sky almost instinctively. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

A middle-aged man in a long golden robe was standing in the air silently, exuding a frightening martial aura.

As Ye Qingtang looked up, the golden-robed man also looked down at Ye Qingtang at the same time.

“It seems that it’s you who annihilated my two teams.” The golden-robed man looked at Ye Qingtang and said without emotions.

“This is bad…”

Ye Qingtang frowned deeply as an inauspicious feeling surged within her.

This person’s cultivation base was unfathomable. Even though this mainland could suppress a cultivator’s cultivation base, the energy inside one’s body was not suppressed.

For Ye Qingtang, her body was filled with primordial qi, but the gold-robed man in the air had already advanced from primordial qi to the force of a Heavenly Venerate.

To advance from primordial qi to the force of a Heavenly Venerate, one’s martial realm had to at least be in the Heavenly Venerate realm.

Even if Ye Qingtang had a similar martial realm as the gold-robed man, Ye Qingtang was using primordial qi while the gold-robed man was using the force of a Heavenly Venerate. These two energies were on entirely different levels… A world of differences…

Ye Qingtang naturally knew that she did not have the slightest chance of victory when opposing the golden-robed man, who possessed the force of a Heavenly Venerate…

At this instant, Blood Moon Elder’s fists were clenched tightly as a somber expression filled his eyes.

“Elder Yin Fo, I told you to guard Wind Cloud City and look after Sky Stars City back then… but is this your reply to me?” Suddenly, the golden-robed man looked at Blood Moon Elder and said coldly.

Blood Moon Elder was slightly taken aback by the gold-robed man’s words. It was then when he suddenly remembered that his current identity was Elder Yin Fo of the You Ancient Clan…

“General, have mercy!!”

The Blood Moon Elder’s eyes brightened. His huge body suddenly kneeled down with a fearful expression. “General… it’s this lady. She lured me away from the base…”

The Blood Moon Elder knew that there were a few Generals and one Commander who came from the You Ancient Clan this time.

Logically speaking, the Captain would not appear easily; thus, this golden-robed man before him should be a general!

“Are you sure you want to find an excuse?” The golden-robed man asked.

Blood Moon Elder secretly sighed in relief. It seemed that he had guessed correctly; this gold-robed man was indeed a general.

“General… I am to blame… Please give me a chance. I will chop this lady into pieces… I will kill her!!” The Blood Moon Elder shouted sternly.

“What are you still waiting for then?” The golden-robed man said expressionlessly.

“Thank you for giving me a chance to amend my mistakes!”

The Blood Moon Elder stood up slowly before turning around to shoot a furious glare at Ye Qingtang and secretly gave her a wink.

“This lowly ant… I will kill you!!” The Blood Moon Elder hollered in rage.
