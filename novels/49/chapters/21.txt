Chapter 22: Pavilion of Treasures (1)

“…..” The man was obviously stunned by the orb’s astonishing words.

To have a child with her…. he laid his eyes once more on the girl sleeping soundly on her bed.

The little black orb clarified gently, “Once the both of you have a child, I swear I’ll return the heart to you. I’ve a will now you know, you can’t retrieve the heart if you go against my will….”

The man knitted his brows. Just like the orb claimed, if it resisted, he could never get his heart back in one piece.

The man’s eyes gleamed with a chilling and murderous intent as he glared at the dark miasma swarming on his hand. He remained silent for some time, till he seemed to have given up on dealing with that at the moment and finally turned around to leave.

After the man left, the little black orb finally stopped trembling. It snuggled down into Ye Qingtang’s bosom again, all curled up like a furball.

“Mommy~ Mommy~”

It liked Ye Qingtang, the girl who “awakened” it. It was her and the demon emperor’s heart that gave birth to it. She must be its mother then!

The man left the Ye’s residence. Mu Su who remained on watch outside the gates noticed a shade of melancholy that hung over the man’s countenance.

“What’s wrong, your highness?” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The man’s brows remained knitted and after a moment of silence….

“How do I get a girl to have a child with me?”

“…..” Mu Su’s eyes nearly popped out of his head at his question.

What on earth had he just heard?!

Who could have thought that the noble, impassive and apathetic demon emperor would ask such an incredible question?!

“That depends….” Mu Su’s thoughts were in full flood. He cleared his throat and hesitated before he answered, “As long as there’s true love between them, I believe the girl will be willing to have the man’s children.”

“True love?” For the first time, a sign of uncertainty showed on the man’s countenance, that had remained glacial since time immemorial.

Ye Qingtang had a dream, a really strange dream.

In her dream, there was a bouncing little black ball, chasing her around, calling her ‘mommy’….

She did not understand why she would have such a weird dream, but after she had woken up, she quickly put that dream behind her.

After she had freshened up, she contemplated her plans. Yesterday, she had managed to get the ball rolling at the Si household but expecting them to go full throttle would be impractical. She was not in a hurry regardless; half a month’s time would be ample for her to complete her preparations.

Since her task at hand was not only acquiring the Si household or Mu Su’s support, as those were considered external factors, to attain her revenge on her past enemies, her own strength was the real decisive factor!

Although she had been blessed with a spirit root again, it was still a weak sapling. She had to nurture it by “feeding” it to its full potential!

Ye Qingtang left her residence and proceeded over to the Pavilion of Treasures, situated at the northeastern side of the city.

The Pavilion of Treasures was a brand that was renowned around the world. Not only in the City of Lin, its branches spread throughout all major cities in the continent. Within it, one is expected to find an abundance of exotic jewelries and wares. As long as you had the coins, any exotic treasure may be as good as yours.

A magnificent and luxurious seven-storied paGoda housed the Pavilion of Treasures. In her past, Ye Qingtang once visited the place when she was down in the dumps. She did not get to buy anything then, because of the exorbitant prices, but now….

A smile played on her lips as she strolled into its building.

Although it was still early in the morning, there were numerous patrons. The assistants in their greyish coats were shuttling amongst the crowd, with a dazzling treasure presented on each of their serving salvers.

Ye Qingtang strolled past the shelves which showcased gems and jewels, arriving in front of a small but quaint counter. Several pieces of gems roughly the size of fingernails were displayed on the counter, each with its own myriad of colors and brilliant lustres.
