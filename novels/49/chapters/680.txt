Chapter 681: Black Market (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“What is that?” The little white tiger suddenly stopped walking. It saw from afar several shabbily-dressed girls shivering in fear as they stood on a wooden stage.

Surrounding the stage were numerous wooden cages that were as tall as a person, and many dejected males and females were locked in it.

Ye Qingtang stopped in her tracks slowly and looked in the direction that the little white tiger was looking at.

When she saw the young girls whose limbs were chained, her brows furrowed automatically.

The biggest difference between the underground black market and other places was the trafficking of slaves.

Slave trafficking was forbidden in both Formidable Heavens Dynasty and Nine Nights Dynasty, though such prohibition was merely on the surface. In Nine Nights Dynasty’s underground black market, slave trafficking was still quietly carried out.

Years ago, slave trafficking was completely prohibited in the Nine Nights Dynasty. However, ever since the previous Emperor was down with illness and the young Emperor succeeded the position, this forbidden transaction started again.

Although the masses never mentioned it, everyone knew that the slave trafficking in the Nine Nights Dynasty was controlled by the premier Qin Long in reality.

Currently, Qin Long presided over political affairs, and the Emperor was young and ignorant. Thus, no one could stop the trafficking of slaves.

With Qin Long as their backer, the slave owners were emboldened, and the transaction of slaves was all the more carried out in the open.

There were a few muscular men who each held a barbed leather whip standing on both sides of the stage with fierce and evil expressions. Their bulky bodies were a starking contrast from those shabby young ladies.

Despair and horror were etched on the faces of those young ladies. They could only stick to each other while trembling, yet their fear was an admiration pleasure of the buyers who were below the wooden stage.

The slave masters waved the leather whip every now and then, making a loud sound. Frightened, those young ladies were shocked to an ash-white shade as they shrieked and whimpered softly. However, their despair and horror attracted the laughter of the onlookers.

“These are the new arrivals just sent a few days ago. I promise that you all will not be disappointed.” A big and fleshy male who stood on the wooden stage laughed as he looked down at the buyers below. As he spoke, he reached out and pulled a young girl over, completely ignoring her struggle and pleas. He ripped her tattered clothes apart, crushing her dignity, and exposed her before everyone.

“Tsk tsk. You humans actually have such a special hobby.” The little white tiger understood what was happening already. Those girls and the people in the cage were being sold as a commodity by those fellows who were also humans.

Ye Qingtang’s face darkened.

In her previous life, when she came to the black market, she was mostly led by her other martial brothers, and they intentionally avoided the areas with slave trafficking. This was the first time Ye Qingtang witnessed the scene of a slave trafficking.

As the onlookers laughed, the girl who was dragged out cried at the top of her lungs. However, her tears did not bring any compassion and instead excited the buyers.

Right at that instant, a male in luxurious clothes arrived in the crowd with a few followers. While that man was dressed gorgeously, his face was exceptionally hideous, and his twisted features seemed to have been burnt before.
