Chapter 2698: The Truth About The Destruction (1)

When Ye Qingtang looked around, she saw that she was in a huge capital city. The sky was already dark but the surroundings were brightly lit. People hurried along the streets but she could see many practitioners dressed like monks. There were also some Daoists who exuded an immortal aura.

“This is...” Wan Rong was surprised. Not only was the architecture incredibly different from the Divine Venerate Domain, even the Spiritual Energy in the air was astonishingly dense.

“The Fourth Domain...” A moment later, Lan Shan, who had been silent the entire time, spoke up.

Lan Shan sized up some of the passing Daoists and monks with his profound gaze. He muttered, “Actually, the monk ancestors of our Great Immortal Temple are experts from the Fourth Domain.”

No one refuted this. Most of the disciples who had joined the Great Immortal Temple earlier knew of this fact. Generally speaking, apart from the Fourth Domain, there were very few Daoists and monks in the other three domains.

It was rumored that in the Fourth Domain, there was an Immortal Buddha martial arts system. The top practitioners could become Immortal Buddhas. They could sense the supreme power of the Great Dao and even use it for themselves.

It was impossible for them to determine the true extent of the martial arts culture in the Fourth Domain. However, there was one thing that could be confirmed—the level of martial arts culture in the Fourth Domain was worlds apart compared to the present domains.

“Is this really the Fourth Domain?” Zhu Yun asked.

All along, the Fourth Domain had only existed in legends. No one had seen the booming martial arts culture of this era.

“It’s very possible. Just the density of the spirit energy here is way beyond that of the Divine Venerate Domain. In addition, the Immortal Buddha martial arts culture here is so prosperous.” Lan Shan agreed with a nod.

“So, this is just an illusion,” Wan Rong said.

“It must be an illusory realm. The Fourth Domain has already been destroyed. If this is really the Fourth Domain, it can only be an illusory realm.” Another disciple piped up.

Ye Qingtang did not speak. Instead she only looked around.

“That’s strange... why do you think the shopkeeper of the ancient city sent us to this illusory realm? Could it be that he wants us to see the flourishing scene of the Fourth Domain?”

“Not necessarily.”

Ye Qingtang suddenly spoke up.

Everyone’s gaze landed on Ye Qingtang.

“Perhaps it’s because of the truth...” Ye Qingtang said. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“The truth?” Lan Shan frowned slightly. “I think I understand...”

“Junior Sister Ye Yue, what truth?” Wan Rong asked curiously.

Among them, Ye Qingtang was the most dependable and intelligent.

“If I’m not wrong, it should be... the truth about the Fourth Domain’s... destruction,” Ye Qingtang muttered after pondering for a moment.

Everyone was surprised.

The truth about the destruction of the Fourth Domain?!

In fact, there were many theories regarding the destruction of the Fourth Domain. There were rumors that the Fourth Domain was destroyed by a natural disaster, or that it was due to a Heavenly Tribulation.

There were also legends that the Fourth Domain was destroyed because of internal strife. Then there were those who claimed that they were destroyed by invincible deities or true devils.

However, the exact details remained an unsolved mystery.

One of the younger disciples said softly, “Senior Sister Ye Yue is indeed meticulous in her thinking. I also made the same conjecture.”
