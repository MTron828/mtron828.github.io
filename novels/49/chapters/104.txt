At the next second, a giant beast walked out of the forest. It was a level five demonic beast with a height of five meters. Its body was full black in color, and its tusks were shimmering under the light. Its deathly red eyes stared at Lu Xiuwen—the only living creature in front of the beast.

Lu Xiuwen panicked when he saw the demonic beast.

A level five demonic beast was not something that the candidates could handle as they had not gone through any training.

“What’s wrong? How can a sect assessment be so difficult?” Lu Xiuwen frowned.

He did not even wish to beat the beast. He would celebrate in joy if he could escape from it.

When Lu Xiuwen was contemplating, the beast roared in rage. Its giant body flew towards him.

Lu Xiuwen held the wax ball tighter, but then he remembered what the middle-aged man told them.

“Nothing inside would threaten your life.”

A thought came through his mind, and he gave up the opportunity of crushing the wax ball. He immediately pulled out the sword by his waist and blocked the beast’s attack.

He could feel a heavy weight from the sword, but such strength was totally incomparable with that from a real level five demonic beast.

Lu Xiuwen’s eyes sparkled, and he dashed forward with his sword.

As time passed, Lu Xiuwen spent a much longer time in the array than all previous candidates.

The middle-aged man’s face softened. Though there were some candidates who lasted inside for quite a while, Lu Xiuwen was in a much better state compared to them.

A streak of blue fog emerged after a long time.

Lu Xiuwen appeared outside the array the next second. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

His face was not pale but still not very pleasant.

Though he found out the trick of the array, he could not find a way to break it. He could only crush the wax ball before he ran out of energy.

However…

Lu Xiuwen took a breath and looked towards Yun Shu.

He believed that the duration he spent inside the array was much longer than all previous candidates. Now, there were only Ye Qingtang and Yun Shu left.

Lu Xiuwen did not bother with Ye Qingtang, who only possessed a red spirit root. Only Yun Shu could compete with him at this assessment.

“Lu Xiuwen, you can now go to the next assessment location.” The middle-aged man spoke to him slowly. He was quite satisfied with Lu Xiuwen’s performance.

Lu Xiuwen spent quite a long time in the array, so all previous candidates had already moved on to the next assessment location.

Lu Xiuwen nodded slightly. His arrogant sight swept pass Yun Shu and landed on Ye Qingtang. He smiled and left.

“Next.” The middle-aged man said.

Yun Shu took a glance at Ye Qingtang. He nodded and walked into the array.

Outside the array, Ye Qingtang was the only person left. A faintly discernible smile emerged on her face. She clearly witnessed the sight from Lu Xiuwen before he left.

Lu Xiuwen was quite talented since he could last so long in the array.

However…

So what?

Ye Qingtang chuckled. She waited patiently for her turn to enter the array.

Yun Shu spent a long time inside. He could only crush the wax ball to leave the array.

When he stepped out of the array, he looked towards Ye Qingtang’s direction instinctively. He was about to remind her about something when the middle-aged man stopped his words.

“Yun Shu, you can now move on to the next assessment location.”
