Chapter 1796: Escape (1)

Seeing that Ye Qingtang was willing to negotiate, the Heavenly Demon Race’s face remained neutral but a glint appeared in his eyes.

As Ye Qingtang pretended to lower her head in thought, the Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General began his attack violently!

“I knew you were up to no good!” Ye Qingtang was already prepared and once again entered the twisted space with the help of the Deity Ocean.

But this time, the Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General was already completely out of patience. Just before Ye Qingtang entered the twisted space, he swiped mercilessly in the direction she disappeared from.

Ye Qingtang who was still recovering from the dizziness of switching space felt a violent shock reverberate around her. As she switched to the other space, she realized that under the constant attack of the Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General, the void energy in the connection point between the two spaces that she was using to enter the other space had taken a heavy blow.

The attack destabilized the void energy and she wasn’t able to enter the other space.

Ye Qingtang broke out in cold sweat.

The Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General must be at his wit’s end to have attempted to attack the void energy at the risk of losing his life. At this rate, she wouldn’t be able to keep hiding from him.

Ye Qingtang flickered back and forth between the sealed space and the twisted space. She was going to return to the mountain peak soon.

She was sure that she would die if she returned to the mountain peak.

The Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General already knew how to prevent her from entering the other space. She wasn’t going to be able to cross space in front of him again. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“What a cunning demon...” Ye Qingtang gritted her teeth as a great sense of urgency overcame her.

Just as Ye Qingtang was at the verge of being killed, she suddenly felt a surge of aura from the Deity Ocean fill her meridian points. Her urgency must have affected it. As the energy from the Deity Ocean entered her, she noticed her body flickering out of sight.

Could it be...

Could the Deity Ocean make her invisible?

Under great danger, Ye Qingtang nudged the Deity Ocean as hard as she could and let its aura wash all over her. As expected, she vanished from sight.

In the face of imminent death, Ye Qingtang was offered a lifeline.

But Ye Qingtang didn’t dare to act rashly.

Even though this method of concealment wasn’t a bad idea, the Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General would still be able to sense her presence with his acute senses.

Ye Qingtang could only force herself to calm down, and an idea popped into her mind...

In the next second, under the incessant attack of the Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General, the void energy was completely destabilized.

Ye Qingtang exited the connection point in a hurry.

As the Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General saw Ye Qingtang appear, he sneered. Just as he got ready to slowly torture this little rascal to death, Ye Qingtang used all the energy she had to blast the mountain peak above his head.

In an instant, the shattered rocks flew into the air and they were enveloped in a huge cloud of dust.

Taking advantage of the chaos, Ye Qingtang reached into the Deity Ocean inside her and entered a state of focus.

The Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General raised his hands and swept a gust of wind towards the cloud of dust, laughing coldly at Ye Qingtang’s futile struggle. But as the dust settled, he realized with a jolt that Ye Qingtang was nowhere to be seen.
