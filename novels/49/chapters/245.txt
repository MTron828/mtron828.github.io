Chapter 244: I Gave It A Dye (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“We can’t stay here for long. Let’s leave now.” Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes slightly and carried the depressed little dragon man in her arms. Looking at its eyes just now, she almost thought that this little fellow would chase after Han Cangming and leave with him!

It was clearly raised by her, but why was it so close to Han Cangming, whom it met for the first time?

Ye Qingtang could not understand the reason but could only treat it as the dragon species’ fondness for powerful people.

Lin Long nodded. After walking a few meters, they suddenly saw Zhou Xuan, who was shot by Ye Qingtang and fell to the ground.

Zhou Xuan was unlucky too: other than being shot in his shoulder, his head actually hit a rock when he fell from the horse, knocking him out immediately.

Ye Qingtang cast a look at Zhou Xuan and then walked away, pretending as though she had not seen anything.

“Junior Sister Ye?” Lin Long was rather confused when she saw Ye Qingtang walking away.

According to the sect rules, whatever Zhou Xuan did previously was enough for him to be kicked out of Xuanling Sect, but… why did Ye Qingtang not do anything?

Ye Qingtang stopped in her tracks and looked at Lin Long with smiling eyes.

“Senior Sister Lin, do you know why the orthodox is so fearful of the Blood Moon Sect’s evil spirits?”

Lin Long shook her head.

Ye Qingtang looked down at the unconscious Zhou Xuan, and a murderous look flashed across her eyes.

“Because the evil cultivation techniques of the Blood Moon Sect could allow the spirits to achieve immortality. Even if the Blood Moon Sect were exterminated and the sect members were killed initially, their souls would not disappear. Thus, the orthodox had to seal their souls. However, they still had a possibility of resurrection centuries later.”

Then, Ye Qingtang pointed at the evil spirit on the floor and said, “Although the evil spirit seems to be killed, it will never disappear. A while later, it will regain consciousness, and at that time… it will naturally need great amounts of spirit energy to nourish itself.”

Ye Qingtang only talked briefly, but the realization hit Lin Long instantly.

Looking at Zhou Xuan on the ground, Lin Long understood Ye Qingtang’s intention and left together with Ye Qingtang without saying anything more.

Ye Qingtang did not have any deep grudges with the evil spirit. In her previous lifetime, the so-called orthodox was the one who drove her to desperation. Thus, she had no interest in participating in the Blood Moon Sect affairs. Moreover, her current abilities were not enough to destroy the evil spirit. Luckily… she was able to sit out and reap the spoils later. What was important now was to bring Lin Long back to the sect as soon as possible and eliminate the Blood Plague in her body.

Ye Qingtang and Lin Long left.

Under the moonlight, the area around Spirit Condensation Mountain Village was desolate. Zombies that had lost all directions and orders stood at the same spot unsteadily.

However, someone appeared silently. Watching Ye Qingtang leave, there seemed to be a slight change in Wu Zheng’s expression. However, he quickly looked away and found the unconscious Wu Chengze in the mess and poured a bottle of elixir into his mouth.

When Wu Chengze was awake, he saw that all his relatives had turned into zombies. Yet, there was not a slight trace of pain in his eyes as he frantically searched for the evil spirit.

“Master!” Madness filled Wu Chengze’s face when he saw the evil spirit that collapsed on the ground.

Wu Zheng watched coldly from aside. His face remained emotionless as he looked at how Wu Chengze was completely unbothered about the lives of all his relatives.

Very quickly, Wu Chenze spotted the unconscious Zhou Xuan from not far away, and an evil glimmer appeared in his eyes.

“Go! Bring that sect disciple over here! Master needs nourishment from essence!”
