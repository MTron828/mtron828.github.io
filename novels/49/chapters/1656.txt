Chapter 1657: A Little Nervous (1)

Elder Qian and the others all knew that the Qiu family wanted to flaunt their strength, but the Martial Arts Championship had only just begun, so victory was still uncertain.

“Oh look, someone from your Jiang Family is entering the arena.” Elder Qiu did not care that Elder Qian and the others were ignoring him. His eyes were fixed on the arena.

A slender figure clothed in the Jiang Family attire was slowly stepping onto the arena.

Elder Qian and the others had intended to ignore Elder Qiu, but when they heard Elder Qiu suddenly say this, they subconsciously looked at the dais.

Their hearts fell.

At that moment, the person standing in the arena was Ye Qingtang, whom they couldn’t help but be worried about.

In the last few rounds, Elder Qian and the others had been too busy to bother about Ye Qingtang. Now Ye Qingtang was in the arena and the Qiu family elder happened to be standing next to them. The dismay on Elder Qian and the others’ faces was almost palpable.

Although they were already mentally prepared for Ye Qingtang to lose terribly, Elder Qiu was now keeping a close eye on them. They could not help but wince. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

If they lost very badly, Elder Qiu would taunt and mock the Jiang family with no mercy.

Elder Qian and the others were mentally prepared to refute Elder Qiu’s taunts, but the Jiang family youths had not performed well in the last few championships, while the Qiu family had done exceptionally well. So their retorts were rather half-hearted.

At that moment, Elder Kun wished he could hint to Ye Qingtang to find an excuse not to compete. If she suffered a terrible defeat, their Jiang family’s reputation would be in tatters.

“I already told you not to let her come. Now look, that jerk from the Qiu family is all prepared to mock us,” Elder Kun murmured with a slight frown.

Elder Qian was not looking too good either. Initially, Elder Kun and the others had suggested that Ye Qingtang excuse herself on grounds of poor health, and admit defeat because she was unable to enter the arena. But Elder Qian had refused.

Elder Qian felt that Ye Qingtang had worked very hard for half a year. Wouldn’t it be too cruel to deprive her of this opportunity?

However...

He had not expected Elder Qiu to be right next to him when Ye Qingtang entered the arena.

Elder Qiu seemed to sense that something was amiss with the Jiang family elders. He could not help but glance at Ye Qingtang, who was in the arena. He saw an extremely beautiful girl with a slender figure, but she was otherwise unassuming.

“That girl doesn’t look familiar. Is your family secretly hiding a trump card up its sleeve? Now that we’re all here at the Martial Arts Championship, there’s no need to conceal her anymore.” Elder Qiu said with a laugh. His words sounded particularly sarcastic on the ears of Elder Qian and the others.

How could she possibly be familiar?

She had arrived less than half a year ago...

Elder Qian and the others were only praying that Ye Qingtang would either be defeated in a single stroke, or hang on and swiftly concede defeat. That would be better than a lingering struggle in the arena, which would further embarrass the Jiang family.

Outside the arena, Jiang Yisheng, Jiang Shaobai and the others were looking at Ye Qingtang, who was in the arena. They had no other concerns, and were sincerely cheering Ye Qingtang on.

“Although this girl’s opponent is not very powerful, to her, he is a formidable opponent. I think she will be defeated within three moves,” Jiang Yiran swaggered over and did not care to filter his words.

“No one will think you’re mute if you don’t say anything.” Jiang Yisheng looked fierce as he retorted.
