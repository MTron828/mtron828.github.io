The jade pendant belonged only to their clan and would show the totem whenever it came into contact with their blood.

“My jade pendant is different from Aunt Jiu’s. Mine shows a dragon totem but Aunt Jiu’s one shows a flame totem when it touches her blood...”

Fu Qiu’s gaze shifted from the jade pendant but it did not reply to Long Xiao.

“I know that you have your concerns, but if you know where she is, please warn her. She’s in a very dangerous situation right now and needs to take care of herself.” Long Xiao turned to leave with Long Yi and the rest after saying this, as though he had no intention of hearing Fu Qiu’s reply.

Were they going to just leave like this? Long Yao felt a little apprehensive about leaving and murmured, “Elder brother, we’re leaving now? It hasn’t even said anything.”

A smile was on Long Xiao’s face as he replied, “Fu Qiu is set on protecting Aunt Jiu, which is why he has his own concerns. If Aunt Jiu is still here, Fu Qiu will definitely confirm what we said with her and once she finds out that we are here, she will naturally seek us out.”

Long Yao seemed to only understand part of this, but did not say anything else.

Meanwhile, Fu Qiu’s expression shifted when it saw Long Xiao and the others leave. After making sure that they had left, Fu Qiu walked straight to Ye Qingtang’s room and told her all about the Jade pendant Long Xiao had shown it.

Ye Qingtang was surprised after hearing Fu Qiu’s words. She had never noticed what happened to the pendant whenever it touched blood before.

Wanting to try it out, Ye Qingtang took her jade pendant out, bit the tip of her finger, and let her blood drip on it.

As the fresh blood dripped onto the jade pendant, it lit up and a flame totem appeared on it.

Ye Qingtang froze as she saw it. It looked so familiar.

“Fu Qiu, you said that that man had a dragon totem?” Ye Qingtang asked.

Fu Qiu nodded. He was afraid that Ye Qingtang would not know what it looked like and had drawn a picture for her.

When she saw the image of the dragon totem, Ye Qingtang’s expression changed. Looking at the dragon totem and the flame totem reminded here of an influential clan in the Second Domain...

“The Dragon Emperor Clan...” Ye Qingtang mumbled to herself.

The Dragon Emperor Clan was influential in the Second Domain. Ye Qingtang had only heard of its name before but had never thought that... her mother was related to the Dragon Emperor Clan.

Was her mother someone from that clan?

If it were to be true, it was a shocking revelation.

No wonder Long Yao had talked about the Ten Thousand Poison Valley so casually. As someone from the Dragon Emperor Clan, of course, she wasn’t scared of the Ten Thousand Poison Valley.

Ye Qingtang had no idea about the totem that appeared on the pendant while Long Xiao had known about it. He had even known about the totem that appeared on Ye Qingtang’s pendant. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

If everything was as she was thinking...

Her mother was likely someone from the Dragon Emperor Clan.

But...

With such power, what was it that made her mother need to escape the Second Domain?

Ye Qingtang’s head was filled with confusion. Long Xiao and the rest were probably the only ones who could explain this.

“That little rascal is related to you?” Little White Tiger was shocked.
