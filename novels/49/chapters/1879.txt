Chapter 1880: Ten Thousand Poison Valley (2)

Just as Qingtang was about to return to her room to think about the day’s events, she noticed that Baili Xi and the rest were all standing outside her room waiting for her.

“Qingtang.” They stepped forwards and greeted her. The animosity they had previously was gone after spending time with her and the way they addressed her had changed as well.

Seeing that they seemed to have something they wanted to say to her, she opened her room door to let them in.

Once they were inside, Baili Xi and the rest spoke up.

“The people who arrived today are no weaklings. Their heavy injuries don’t seem to be from the monsters and I’m afraid there are other powerful men in this mystic realm.” Baili Xi frowned as he said this. Since they were not in the same line of work, he didn’t know Long Yao that well.

But Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo could tell that the black-clad men with Long Yi were all powerful. They could only imagine how strong their opponent had been that they had suffered such heavy injuries.

“We’ve already been in this mystic realm for a few days. Shouldn’t we find the exit as soon as possible and get out of here?” Mu Feiruo said.

They had been faced with so many grave dangers after entering the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm. Now that it had gotten to this point, they no longer had any will to look for the treasures and were content with leaving with their lives intact.

There would definitely be a treasure in the mystic realm, but they had no mind to think about it in their current state.

Ye Qingtang naturally understood their concerns but was still fixated on the connection between Long Yao’s group and her mother. But she couldn’t tell this to Baili Xi and the rest.

“We’re going to search for the exit while it’s still dark. What do you think?” Mu Feiruo asked.

Ye Qingtang nodded.

Baili Xi and the rest could leave first if they found the exit but Ye Qingtang was in no hurry.

They were relieved to see that Ye Qingtang had not objected.

Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo had both entered the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm before. While their current situation was slightly different, they still understood the rules of the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm.

That night, Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo set out to find the exit.

Jiang Shaobai’s gaze subconsciously swept over Ye Qingtang, as though he was thinking about something. But when Ye Qingtang looked back at him, he merely had a cynical smile on his face.

Long Yao was still beside her brother. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Little Miss, Young Master Long Xiao has sustained severe injuries, he will need time to rest and recover,” said Long Yi.

Long Yao’s forehead was tightly furrowed.

“Did anyone from the Ten Thousand Poison Valley follow you when you ran?” Long Yao asked the other guards.

The guards shook their heads.

The young girl’s forehead remained furrowed as her eyes swept over the guards. A black mist seemed to be surrounding their wounds.

“The poison from the Ten Thousand Poison Valley...” Long Yao laughed coldly.

“The people from the Ten Thousand Poison Valley are really devious. Your wounds are all infected with the poison from them. No matter where you go, they will be able to follow the black mist to find us,” Long Yao said softly as she gritted her teeth.

Had they been outside of this mystic realm, she wouldn’t be afraid to face... But now that they were here, they were clearly outnumbered. If the people from the Ten Thousand Poison Valley were to follow them here, it would mean sure death.
