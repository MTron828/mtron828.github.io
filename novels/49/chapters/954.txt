Chapter 955 Return to Lin Town (6)

“Tang Tang, surely you haven’t taken Xuanling Sect’s authentic precious immortal elixir?!” Master Si looked at Ye Qingtang gravely.

Ye Qingtang could not help but laugh when she heard that. She did not show any sign of being offended. The fact that Master Si could say these things showed that he treated her like one of his family. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Grandfather Si, you don’t need to worry. I didn’t steal it from the Xuanling Sect,” said Ye Qingtang. She naturally knew what Master Si was worried about.

“Ai… since that is so, you should have kept this wonderful immortal elixir…” Master Si’s heart still ached at the waste.

“Grandfather Si, these things have not much value to me,” explained Ye Qingtang.

“No value?”

Master Si was taken aback when he heard Ye Qingtang’s words. It was as if he had misheard.

However, Master Si very quickly understood that this was just Ye Qingtang’s excuse.

“That’s right.” Ye Qingtang took a red bottle from her space ring. There were approximately fifty scarlet elixirs in it. “Grandfather Si, this is for you.”

Master Si looked suspicious. He took the red bottle that Ye Qingtang handed to him and opened it. When he saw the contents of the bottle, he was stunned and could not believe his eyes.

The red bottle… was filled with the scarlet elixir he had taken just now…

Just as Master Si was staring at it blankly, Ye Qingtang took a premium yellow-grade weapon from her space ring. “Elder Brother Si Ye, I think this sword suits you, so I’ll give it to you.”

“This…”

Si Ye took the sword and studied it. His pupils contracted violently in disbelief.

In the entire Lin Town or even in its ten neighboring cities, a premium yellow-grade weapon had never appeared before. Even Clan Master Long, a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord, only carried a sword that was a superior yellow-grade weapon!

But what Ye Qingtang had given him was a premium yellow-grade…

Si Ye was ashen. He almost subconsciously returned the premium yellow-grade weapon to Ye Qingtang.

“What’s the matter? Don’t you like it, Elder Brother Si Ye?” Ye Qingtang looked at Si Ye. “This sword is not great, but black-grade divine weapons are not easy to control… also, in a sense, this sword is not inferior to ordinary black-grade divine weapons.”

“No… no, no, no, Tang Tang, you can’t do this. It’s too valuable!” Si Ye shook his head repeatedly. Although he desperately wished to accept this premium yellow-grade weapon, logic told Si Ye that he could not do so. Si Ye’s emotions were momentarily thrown into turmoil.

He could not accept such a valuable gift from Ye Qingtang for no reason. In Si Ye’s eyes, a premium yellow-grade weapon was as valuable as a divine weapon.

It would be the same as someone giving Ye Qingtang a heaven-level divine weapon for no reason…

But Si Ye did not know that Ye Qingtang’s space ring contained innumerable weapons of this grade. What he considered to be a divine weapon was no different from a piece of scrap metal in Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

“It’s not valuable. Please accept it.” Ye Qingtang threw the premium yellow-grade weapon over to Si Ye.

Si Ye’s martial talent was quite good. The sword he currently carried was an ordinary weapon forged in a weapons shop. With Si Ye’s martial ability, a premium yellow-grade weapon would cause him to level up by more than one grade.

At that moment, Si Ye’s emotions were in turmoil. This premium yellow-grade weapon was just too valuable. If he accepted it…

However, Si Ye’s eyes remained glued to the premium yellow-grade weapon in his hand.
