Chapter 100: Sect Assessment (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The first step of the sect assessment was to assess the candidates’ spirit roots.

Red ones were inferior-grade, orange and yellow ones were medium-grade, and green ones were superior-grade. If one possessed a blueish-green spirit root, they would be able to skip the outer sect and become an inner sect disciple immediately.

As for blue and purple spirit roots, no one had seen one for over a thousand years. None of the sect were still hoping for that.

The way Xuanling Sect assessed spirit roots was rather special. It did not require candidates to show their spirit root. Instead, they would place their hands on a human-sized Spirit Stone and direct their strength using their spirit root. The Spirit Stone would change into the same color as their spirit root.

The order people were tested was based on the sequence in which people finished the Path to Heaven, starting from the last.

The first candidate stepped forward and placed his hand on the Spirit Stone. Soon, the ivory stone turned yellow in color.

“Yellow spirit root, next,” A middle-aged man who was in charge of the assessment said.

That candidate was quite delighted. His yellow spirit root was inferior to a green spirit root, but he was qualified to enter the sect at least.

Candidates who followed up all showed yellow or orange colors.

At last, Lu Xiuwen stepped forward. Everyone focused on him, and even the middle-aged man who was bored with orange and yellow colors also showed some interest.

Lu Xiuwen walked towards the giant Spirit Stone and placed his hand on the stone.

At that instant, a spark of green appeared and covered the entire Spirit Stone within a second.

“Green spirit root, not bad.” The middle-aged man looked at Lu Xiuwen in contentment.

Green spirit root was quite rare. Disciples with green spirit roots could all enter the inner sect after training in the outer sect. Lu Xiuwen was expected to be an inner sect disciple with his green spirit root.

Lu Xiuwen smiled gently. He lifted up his chin slightly and stepped back when everyone looked at him with admiration.

“I think Lu Xiuwen definitely can pass the assessment since he is from the Formidable Heavens Dynasty.”

“I agree. He stands out with that green spirit root. Even if the other assessments are not up to expectation, his spirit root will grant him into the sect.”

Candidates who had their spirit roots assessed could not help but envy him.

There were many sect assessments. One would fail if they made any mistake. However, a green spirit root would serve as insurance to cover for any possible mistakes in other assessments.

One would need to pass all assessments successfully if their spirit roots were not superior. For example, they would say goodbye to the sect if they made any mistake in any assessment with their orange or yellow spirit roots.

Yun Shu was the next person after Lu Xiuwen.

Yun Shu was not arrogant like Lu Xiuwen. He smiled gently and nodded towards the middle-aged man with respect. He then placed his hand on the Spirit Stone.

Another round of applause was heard when the green color appeared.

“Green spirit root.” The middle-aged man was in a very good mood now. It made the assessment this year more interesting when two green spirit roots appeared.

The better the quality of one’s spirit root, the faster the speed of cultivation. Their strength would be purer as well. The quality of spirit root served as the foundation for a person. One could achieve higher levels with a better spirit root.

Yun Shu stepped back humbly and looked towards Ye Qingtang instinctively.

Ye Qingtang’s spirit root was the only one left to assess among all candidates. Everyone was staring at Ye Qingtang now.

No one forgot how easily Ye Qingtang achieved the first place on the Path to Heaven, and she was ahead of everyone.

Lu Xiuwen also gazed at Ye Qingtang. His sight was less calm but more doubtful.

Ye Qingtang had gained an advantage through the Path to Heaven. If her spirit root was of good quality, she would be another popular candidate whom he had to fight with to enter the sect.
