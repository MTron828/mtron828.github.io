The wind from Song Junqiu’s palm attack passed Ye Qingtang and crashed on the edge of the ring.

With a loud boom, the sturdy ring was shattered by the wind of his attack, kicking up a storm of dust.

If his palm landed on Ye Qingtang, her internal organs and even bones would probably be crushed.

Song Junqiu fought with Ye Qingtang continuously. Vicious expressions appeared in the eyes of the three disciples who stood at three different locations. Then, with full concentration, they directed their energy, and a rush of spirit energy spread around them, forming into the shape of three huge dragons in midair!

Immediately, the three people attacked at the same instant, and the three huge dragons in the sky crashed straight into the center of the ring.

Song Junqiu took notice of the rapidly-descending illusory dragons from the corner of his eye. He sneered and immediately withdrew backward.

“Junior Sister Ye, take care…” Song Junqiu scoffed and was already a few steps away from Ye Qingtang the instant the three huge dragons were about to crash on her.

A rumble suddenly boomed in the air. Under the impact of the huge force, the entire ring was smashed into pieces. As spiderweb-like cracks spread all over the ring and clouds of dust were stirred up, dragon roars sounded one after another. The dust obstructed everyone’s vision.

“Illusion of the Dragon’s Breath? Are Song Junqiu and the rest crazy?!!” The onlooking disciples were astonished by the three illusory dragons.

This was one of the inner sect’s cultivation techniques and was extremely lethal. No one expected that they would actually use such a move on Ye Qingtang.

“Exactly how much does Song Junqiu want to kill Ye Qingtang?”

As dust flew around the place, a vicious glint twinkled in Song Junqiu’s eyes. The three disciples had already walked to his side, and the four partners-in-crime watched the dusty haze before them.

“Senior Brother Song, Ye Qingtang is really dead this time,” a disciple said with a laugh.

Song Junqiu replied. “Since this is what she chose, she can’t blame anyone. The winner is set. We can leave already.”

The three disciples nodded slightly. The combined attack of three disciples who were at stage two of the First Heaven definitely was not what Ye Qingtang, who was at stage one of the First Heaven, could block. They were certain that Ye Qingtang would die without a doubt and immediately prepared to leave the ring with Song Junqiu.

When they reached the edge of the ring, the three sharp-eyed disciples saw Ni Shang, who blanked out below the ring with tears in her eyes.

“Little beauty… I’m afraid your Miss is dead this time. What is the point of doing this? If only you obediently submitted to us, you would not cause her to have such an ending. She is already dead now, and no one will be able to protect you anymore. Wait for us alright,” those three disciples said insolently with despicable laughs.

One of them even bent forward and wanted to touch Ni Shang’s face.

Fei Ying hurriedly pulled Ni Shang behind him to protect her.

But just as that disciple stretched his hand out, a cold glint suddenly shot out from the storm of dust. With a flash, a shrill cry escaped from the mouth of that frivolous disciple!

The twinkling Demonic Blood Sword was stuck straight at the edge of the ring with traces of blood on it.

The hand that wanted to fool around with Ni Shang fell on the ring, and large gushes of blood jetted out from the disciple’s broken arm!

“My hand!!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“You want to touch my person? You don’t have the ability to so.” An icy cold voice suddenly sounded from the center of the ring.
