Chapter 1159: Splitting The Battlefield (2)

“Master, there is more than one ancient clan between the mountains and the clouds. The ancient clan controlling the southern war zone is not the same as the clan that came to Falling Sky Valley previously,” said Ye Qingtang.

The ancient clan that came to the Falling Sky Valley previously was the most powerful ancient clan in this mainland and had members who were Tenth Heaven Yang Lords. However, in the battle of the Falling Sky Valley, most of the powerful cultivators of that ancient clan had been killed by Divine King Luo Xue, so they were greatly weakened.

However, the ancient clan holding the southern zone was an ancient clan hidden between the mountains and clouds and was different from the other ancient clan.

Perfected Xuanchen relaxed after hearing Ye Qingtang’s explanation.

At that moment, the Ye Family members all sighed. The mainland’s battlefield was divided into three zones. They were cultivators in the southern battlefield but were too weak to fight the Ancient You Clan. Although they were cultivators of this mainland, they had no way of protecting their homeland once it was invaded. They were not even worthy of entering the battlefield…

Even Ye Qingtang was somewhat worried.

Even without dividing up the powerful cultivators of this mainland, the Pagoda Sword Master, the Ultimate Elder, and the Master of the Ancient Clan could hold their own against the three generals. The extremely powerful cultivators at the same level as the generals were about equal in numbers. But below the rank of general, their numbers differed vastly.

The vast difference in numbers meant that this mainland would die slowly.

The Ultimate Elder and Pagoda Sword Master, and even the Master of the ancient clan, knew this, but they had no other recourse.

If things carried on like that, before long… the three battlefields would slowly be lost!

“Eldest Young Lady… what should we do?” Daoist Zijin looked at Ye Qingtang and asked worriedly.

Besides the powerful cultivators from the hidden ancient clan and the Ancient You Clan, cultivators at the level of Daoist Zijin would normally be considered the most powerful cultivators in this mainland, second only to the three main forces.

But with the changes that occurred in this mainland—the Ancient You Clan’s invasion, the Pagoda Sword Master’s return, the Ultimate Elder’s appearance, the hidden ancient clan resurfacing… their status was reduced to nothing. They were not even worthy of being used as cannon fodder.

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly and did not hurry to answer. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Based on Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder’s power, they could be considered the most powerful cultivators in this mainland. However, they were unable to change the tide of battle. The Ancient You Clan was just too powerful and too numerous. Also, there was still the powerful commander in chief who had not yet made an appearance.

In the long run, how long could this mainland last? A few days? A few months? Or even half a year?

No matter how long it lasted, the conclusion was inevitable.

This heralded the end of this mainland’s hopes.

Ye Qingtang took a deep breath. Although she felt helpless to change the situation, at that moment, her gaze swept across everyone in the Falling Sky Valley, and she spoke decisively.

“I will protect all of you… until the last possible moment.”

In her previous life, she had no cares or worries. She had left this mainland early without knowing what kind of crisis it experienced in the end.

Today, the people she cared about the most were all in this mainland.

Her relatives, her master…

Even though there was no hope, she would guard them all to the very end.

When they heard that, everyone quavered.

Although Ye Qingtang had not spoken loudly, each one of her decisive words reached their ears.

It was just a simple sentence, but under the circumstances, this promise was worth its weight in gold…
