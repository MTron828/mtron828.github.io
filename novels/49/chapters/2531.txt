Chapter 2532: Karmic Divination (4)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

If the strong could be produced just by nurturing, then there would be no difference between the weak and the outstanding.

Everyone knew this, but it was also not an absolute law. There was a world of difference between the effectiveness of an ordinary academy and a top academy in nurturing the same student.

With the big yellow dog’s strength, even if it could not train her to be at its level, it can at least help her improve significantly.

“Little girl, don’t look at me like that. I know what you’re thinking, but don’t forget, I’m just a dog. I’m not a human. I don’t know much about the physical or spiritual attributes of your human race. We are of a completely different species. How can I teach you… We are incompatible.”

The big yellow dog also felt rather frustrated. It knew what it had to do to train a dog, but it really had no idea how to train a human.

“Also, you shouldn’t depend too much on me. I can’t even protect myself now. If my enemies find me one day, I might even implicate you.” The big yellow dog sighed.

“You previously said that energy cannot be gathered here. That is true,” Ye Qingtang said seriously as she stared at the big yellow dog.

The big yellow dog nodded. “Of course it’s true. Why would I lie to you? Do I look like an all-powerful dog who just prefers to keep a low profile?”

Ye Qingtang rubbed her chin and sized up the big yellow dog before shaking her head. It really did not look like it.

“That’s right. I can’t accumulate my powers because of the laws here… otherwise, I would have already reigned supreme in your lower realm. Would I have to beg for food so pitifully from you?” The big yellow dog sighed.

“Then… is there any way to help you?” Ye Qingtang asked the big yellow dog after a moment of silence.

If she could help the big yellow dog recover its strength, it would remember her good deed. By then, wouldn’t she be extremely formidable too?

“Yes!” The big yellow dog immediately stood up and wagged its tail. “Just destroy the natural laws of the lower realm!”

Ye Qingtang stared at the big yellow dog for a moment. Her lips twitched. “Go to sleep. It’s getting late.”

“If you can’t do that, you can also send me back to the upper realm!” Seeing that Ye Qingtang seemed to have lost the desire to continue talking to it, the big yellow dog changed its tone.

“Send you back to the upper realm?” Ye Qingtang was deep in thought. “How can I send you back?”

“When your powers are high enough to interfere with the natural laws of the lower realm, you can then ascend to the upper realm!” the big yellow dog said, wagging its tail.

Ye Qingtang, “…”

“Go to sleep. It’s late.” Ye Qingtang could not be bothered with the big yellow dog anymore and blew out the candle.

Destroy the natural laws of the world. Interfere with the natural laws of the world… was this big yellow dog talking nonsense? If she had such heaven-defying divine powers, would she still be hiding in this lousy relay station and talking nonsense to it? Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Little girl, don’t be disheartened… No matter what, you were the one who brought me out of that damned place. I owe you a favor. Don’t worry, I always avenge the crimes against me and repay favors owed. I can grant you a wish…” The big yellow dog’s voice drifted out in the darkness.

Ye Qingtang said, “I want…”

The big yellow dog said, “Go to sleep. It’s getting late..”
