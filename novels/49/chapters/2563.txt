Ye Qingtang nodded and said, “This is the best opportunity. Otherwise, the auspicious signs that you mentioned will probably attract the various factions in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain. It will not be easy to infiltrate then.”

Besides, once she became a disciple of the Dragon Emperor Clan, she would not be qualified to go with those big shots of the Dragon Emperor Clan.

“Yes, alright. I’ll think of a way to help you absorb the karma energy. See if you can obtain the recognition of the ancient gods, as only with their approval can you enter the Ancient Gods Karma Tunnel. If the ancient gods don’t acknowledge you, you won’t be able to enter even if you wanted to,” the big yellow dog said.

Without further ado, Ye Qingtang asked the big yellow dog to inform the Blood Moon Elder. She tidied up and strode out of the guest room area.

The middle-aged man had been waiting outside for a long time.

“Hehe, Miss Ye, are you not staying for a few more days?” The middle-aged man chuckled when he saw Ye Qingtang walk out of the room.

“Senior, I have some private matters to attend to. After I’m done, I’ll return to the Dragon Emperor Clan to be a disciple,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Miss Ye is truly not simple. Many talented youths wish to join the Dragon Emperor Clan as a disciple. Unfortunately, most of them died undergoing the clan’s stringent tests. It seems that Lord Long Yun is very fond of Miss Ye. Otherwise, Miss Ye would not have such an opportunity.” The middle-aged man smiled.

Indeed, the white-haired elder bore no ill intent towards her. Actually, there was no need for him to give her the disciple token before she left, but he had still given it to her.

“Holy Lady, I’m here!”

The Blood Moon Elder walked over with the big yellow dog and several bags.

Ye Qingtang’s expression changed when she saw the bags in the Blood Moon Elder’s hand. Did he empty all the rooms in the Dragon Emperor Clan’s guest area?

The Blood Moon Elder did not expect someone from the Dragon Emperor Clan to be here either. He looked rather embarrassed and said, “I saw the delicious food and elixirs… it’s a waste to leave them here. That’s why I took them. I’m not greedy, but I’m afraid of wasting them… Should I put them back?”

Before Ye Qingtang could say anything, the middle-aged man waved his hand and said with a smile, “Brother, you are guests invited by the Dragon Emperor Clan. Take whatever you want from those rooms. It’s not a big deal.”

“Thank you then…” Ye Qingtang looked at the middle-aged man.

She had really been embarrassed by the Blood Moon Elder.

“It’s getting late. Follow me. I am responsible for escorting you out of the Black Mountain safely,” the middle-aged man said.

Demons often appeared in the mountains of the Dragon Emperor Clan. They were extremely powerful. Even some of the more outstanding younger disciples of the Dragon Emperor Clan had died tragically at the hands of those demons.

Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder followed the middle-aged man and reached the foot of the Black Mountain safely in about an hour.

“Alright, Miss Ye. We’ll meet again if fate allows it. Be careful on the road,” the middle-aged man said with a smile.

“Thank you for taking care of me these last two days. Farewell.”

Ye Qingtang cupped her fists respectfully at the middle-aged man and quickly left the mountain range with the Blood Moon Elder.

...

“My Lord, Miss Ye has left.”

After Ye Qingtang disappeared, the middle-aged man knelt on one knee and bowed to empty air.
