Chapter 395: Give A Try (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The thousand-year cold iron was very rare and precious. This kind of iron originated from extremely cold places, and it carried low temperature by itself. It would require a very high temperature to melt. Thus, the control of the temperature must be very accurate. Any mistake would damage the coldness of the cold iron itself.

“The body of the Remnant Ice Sword is extremely thin. It’s a problem for us now to cool it down and forge its shape. If we place it into ice water for immediate cooling, the sudden change of temperature may break the sword. If we cool it down slowly, the shape of the sword body may be altered during the process.”

The incharge had a very bad headache thinking about the problem. The shape of the Remnant Ice Sword had been forged earlier on. However, they could not find a way to cool it down as the body was too thin. They had dragged on for a few days now. If they continued dragging on, the special property of the ice iron might be damaged.

The body of the sword was so thin that it was extremely difficult to forge. Even the same batch of blacksmiths also could not guarantee that they could forge another one.

“Little girl, what do you think? What’s the best way to cool down the Remnant Ice Sword?” The incharge asked Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang did not reply immediately.

The incharge’s question caught the blacksmiths’ attention. They turned their head to find out the person whom the incharge asked.

They thought that the person must be a senior blacksmith but…

They saw a fifteen-year-old girl standing in front of them.

Their faces changed immediately.

How much forging knowledge could a young girl know?

They only treated it as a random question and returned to their discussion.

Ye Qingtang stared at the Remnant Ice Sword for a while and said slowly, “Cold water may break it. Hot water may alter its shape. I think the frost condensate water may work.”

“Frost condensate water?” The incharge was stunned for a moment.

The frost condensate water could not be considered as water by its properties. It was more like a thick liquid with strong adherence. It was ductile with a low temperature and could bear with high heat.

It was usually used to fill in the boxing gloves temporarily under high temperatures as it would not evaporate.

However…

He had never heard of using it to cool down weapons.

The incharge hesitated.

Ye Qingtang’s words caught the blacksmiths’ attention again. They looked towards Ye Qingtang, and their eyes were full of disagreement.

“Little girl, don’t talk when you don’t understand. How can the frost condensate water be used to cool down weapons? Are you joking?” one of the blacksmiths said unpleasantly.

Though the frost condensate water would not evaporate, its conductivity was strong. Its own temperature would increase when it was in contact with hot objects. It could not maintain a low temperature for cooling down.

The blacksmiths only treated her as a young girl who did not know anything, and her suggestion was like a joke to them.

Ye Qingtang shrugged her shoulder and did not say anything. The Remnant Ice Sword was not hers. She was just answering the incharge’s question.

The Remnant Ice Sword must be cooled down today, and no one found an appropriate method until now. The incharge looked at Ye Qingtang and said, “Little girl, how confident are you if I ask you to take over the task?”
