Chapter 1078 The Conspiracy

“Old Valley Master, what are you doing?!”

Perfected Xuanchen was completely dumbfounded upon witnessing the situation. His face was full of disbelief.

The old Valley Master killed a few Peak Masters instantly.

“Master, don’t go.”

Ye Qingtang stretched her hand out and pulled Perfected Xuanchen back to prevent him from getting near the old Valley Master.

“Qingtang, did the old Valley Master enter the Qi Deviation during his treatment!” Perfected Xuanchen looked towards Ye Qingtang immediately.

Ye Qingtang squinted her eyes and scanned through the elder in front of her.

Ye Qingtang pulled back her sight and shook her head towards Perfected Xuanchen. She frowned and said, “Master, I don’t think that the old Valley Master… entered the Qi Deviation.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

When a cultivator entered the Qi Deviation, his own injuries would only get worse. However, based on the old Valley Master’s current situation, he was full of energy and vitality with no trace of injury at all.

Furthermore, if a cultivator entered the Qi Deviation, his martial ability would not increase exponentially. The aura that the old Valley Master revealed just now let Ye Qingtang feel threatened as well…

According to her knowledge, the old Valley Master’s martial ability was just a normal Yang Lord at his peak time.

“Not the Qi Deviation…” Perfected Xuanchen was shocked. If it was not because of the Qi Deviation, what made the old Valley Master like that now?!

The few Peak Masters’ corpses turned into a ball of black fog under the influence of the black pearl at his glabella and were absorbed by the pearl.

“This is weird… Why is the Dimension Wall broken…” The old Valley Master murmured to himself after absorbing the bodies of the few Peak Master.

The old Valley Master’s murmur entered Ye Qingtang’s ears.

At the same time, a black glint radiated out from the old Valley Master’s glabella and surrounded the enter Nine Nights Dynasty.

“It should be enough to use all living creatures in the Nine Nights Dynasty as the price…” The old Valley Master said softly.

Everyone in the Falling Sky Valley froze on the spot and could not believe what was happening.

The black light contained unimaginable power that could destroy everything.

“Come here.”

The old Valley Master looked at some senior members and disciples of the Falling Sky Valley and smiled. In the next second, everyone was killed with his invisible power.“Stop!” Perfected Xuanchen shouted.

The old Valley Master sized up Perfected Xuanchen.

“Old Valley Master, what… what are you doing?!” Perfected Xuanchen’s voice quivered.

The old Valley Master laughed softly and said, “Xuanchen, you’re my favorite person in the entire Falling Sky Valley… If not, I would not ask you to replace the position as the Valley Master back then. However, I’m back now, and you should die in honor.”

The old Valley Master lifted his arm and tried to grab Perfected Xuanchen after he finished his words.

Ye Qingtang immediately blocked Perfected Xuanchen, and her divine power of a Yang Lord exploded out from her body to suppress the old Valley Master’s terrifying power.

“Hehe… A Yang Lord at such a young age… You’re quite extraordinary, even at my age. However, you don’t need to rush. It’ll be your turn after I kill everyone else.” The old Valley Master looked at Ye Qingtang and smiled.

“Your age…” Ye Qingtang frowned slightly when she heard the old Valley Master’s words. He was not as simple as how he appeared…
