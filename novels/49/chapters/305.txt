Chapter 306: Rules (2)

Ye Qingtang furrowed her brows. It was clearly the critical moment for her spirit root to make a breakthrough, but she had to hear such curses. She immediately opened her eyes and looked at that person.

Other inner sect disciples cultivating in the Spirit Consonance River looked over immediately.

“What is your name? Why are you not following the rules!” A disciple reproached.

“Rules?” Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes and glanced over at the faces of the three uninvited people.

When she saw Song Junqiu’s face, she could not help but scoff internally. She thought who it could be, but it was Song Junqiu.

In her previous life when she entered the inner sect, she had heard of Song Junqiu’s name before. Song Junqiu was the son of an inner sect warden and thus had a certain position of influence in the inner sect. Although his natural endowment was not bad, he was domineering. She had heard that Song Junqiu would head to the Spirit Consonance River at a stipulated timing and hog the spring which was the richest with spirit energy, yet…

She did not expect to cross paths with him today.

The two disciples beside Song Junqiu sized up Ye Qingtang with a frown. When they noticed that her clothes did not have an inner sect embroidery, they were shocked.

“I was wondering what kind of person did not know the rules and didn’t expect that it’d actually be an outer sect trash,” a disciple said.

Song Junqiu glimpsed at Ye Qingtang as well, and his expression became even uglier after confirming that Ye Qingtang was only an outer sect disciple.

An outer sect disciple actually dared to snatch his cultivation spot?!

“Move away,” Song Junqiu said coldly with a grim expression.

Ye Qingtang scoffed coldly. “On what basis?”

Song Junqiu’s face turned even uglier. On usual days, all the outer sect disciples were reverent and respectful towards inner sect disciples like them, yet, unexpectedly, this person did not know what was good for her.

“This is my spot. It is not a place that an outer sect disciple like you can step in carelessly.” Song Junqiu lifted his chin, and a belittling expression passed his eyes.

Other onlooking disciples had surprised expressions as well. They did not notice that the girl was actually an outer sect disciple.

It should be known that there were hardly any outer sect disciples in the Spirit Consonance River, and they had already taken this place as an exclusive right for the inner sect. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Yet, unexpectedly…

An outer sect disciple was actually here, and she even unluckily took Song Junqiu’s territory.

Song Junqiu had some connections in the inner sect, and even inner sect disciples would try not to get into conflicts with him. However, this outer sect disciple seemed to not know Song Junqiu’s capabilities and dared to talk back to him!

Was she seeking death!

“Your spot?” Ye Qingtang laughed and glanced at the clear spring. Then, she looked up and tilted her head at Song Junqiu, who was throwing his weight around. “Is your name written or an image of you carved here? Why is it yours?”

“How dare you! You’re an outer sect disciple, yet how dare you speak to Senior Brother Song like this!” A disciple exclaimed.

Ye Qingtang looked at him coldly. There was not a slight trace of fear on her face.

Song Junqiu shot a cold glare at Ye Qingtang and scoffed. “What a sharp tongue. What is your name?”

“Ye Qingtang.”

“Ye Qingtang?” Song Junqiu said and looked at Ye Qingtang coldly. “You are an outer sect disciple. How can you be compared to inner sect disciples like us? It is already your blessing to be able to enter the Spirit Consonance River. If you continue to ask for more, you really don’t know what is good for you!”
