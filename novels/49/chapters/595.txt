Chapter 596: Save People (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“That’s right. The Ouyang clan of the Nine Nights Dynasty agrees to open the door and save people.” The Blood Moon Elder broke the silence.

The others of the Ouyang clan also showed their stand.

Though their Young Miss seemed to be obsessed with the pretty boy, the pretty boy’s words did make sense. The silver door that was made of black iron would not stop a sect master of a super sect. If they could save one person, there would be one more person fighting alongside them.

Soon, some sect disciples looked towards the outside of the palace.

A huge monster appeared in everyone’s vision a few kilometers away in the desert. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“We agree to open the door!” a few sect disciples said.

Even the Yunxiao Sect disciples seemed to change their mind.

“Who dares!” The Yunxiao Sect elder shouted in rage.

However, Ye Qingtang did not even look at the Yunxiao Sect elder. She opened the door instantly without leaving any chance for the elder to talk.

The intense smell of blood came out of the palace the moment the door was opened.

At that moment, people outside then saw the scene clearly…

There were bloodstains everywhere in the second palace, and there were broken limbs scattered on the ground. The scene was too horrible to look at.

Around ten men and women were lying beside the door. Their faces were filled with despair.

“Come out now!” Ye Qingtang shouted towards the people who were still in shock.

The ten of them then regained their consciousness and looked towards the direction of the voice.

When they saw that the silver door was opened, they immediately got up and flew outside.

“Thank you so much, brother!” One of the Yuehua Sect disciples looked at Ye Qingtang with gratitude. His cupped fists were trembling slightly.

“Tsk tsk…”

A sinister laugh was heard before Ye Qingtang could say anything.

An elder in a red robe was seen in the second palace. He was holding a sword, and his whole body was stained with blood. His eyes were filled with craziness, and a sinister laugh came out of his mouth.

Ye Qingtang saw the elder during the fight between Xuanling Sect and Yunxiao Sect. He was the Yuehua Sect Master.

“Close the door!”

Ye Qingtang closed the silver door immediately at the same time.

“What happened exactly? You followed the Yuehua Sect Master into the second palace together. How come he went crazy inside?” A sect warden asked immediately as the ten people escaped from the second palace.

“Sect Master… he appeared to be possessed by the demon the moment he entered the second palace… We also don’t know what happened.” A Yuehua Sect disciple recalled but his face was still full of horror.

Boom!

A loud sound was heard at the next second. The closed silver door was under attack by the Yuehua Sect Master

Based on the Yuehua Sect Master’s ability, the silver door would not be enough to trap him.

Boom! Boom!

The silver door exploded under a sword breath.

The elder, who looked like a demon from hell, walked towards the crowd. He held his sword, and the martial aura he emanated was very intense.

“Only death can set us free… I’m… helping you.” The Yuehua Sect Master’s face was filled with madness.

He walked towards the Blood Moon Elder as he finished his words.

The Blood Moon Elder’s face changed as he saw the Yuehua Sect Master walking towards him.

“Thank you so much… but we don’t even know each other. As a young lady, I do not deserve your help. How about helping the rest first!”
