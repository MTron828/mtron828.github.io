Chapter 466: Senior Brother and Junior Sister (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Seeing that Yue Tiancheng finally believed her fully, Ye Qingtang’s lips curled up as a cold sneer filled the back of her eyes.

She never expected this Yue Tiancheng to be so cautious and distrustful. Fortunately, she searched the body of that disciple whom Yi Tianchou killed and obtained this Yunxiao token.

“Haha… Junior sister, it is my nature to be distrustful. Please forgive me.” Yue Tiancheng laughed.

Currently, Yue Tiancheng had completely believed in Ye Qingtang’s identity as a Yunxiao Sect disciple.

“No worries. After all, I just entered Yunxiao Sect and am an outer sect disciple. It is understandable that you’re suspicious of me since you haven’t seen me before.” Ye Qingtang replied.

Noticing that Yue Tiancheng had let his guard down, Ye Qingtang suddenly looked at Ji Yixuan and pretended to be surprised. “Senior Brother Yue, who is that? Why is he trapped in the array formation?”

Yue Tiancheng scoffed at that. “The disciple of Perfected Xuanchen in Falling Sky Valley. As a citizen of Nine Nights Dynasty, he was so bold to come to the Formidable Heavens Dynasty. Our sect had arranged spies in Falling Sky Valley, and they notified me of Ji Yixuan’s route and motive of coming to the Formidable Heavens Dynasty.”

Upon hearing Yue Tiancheng’s words, Ji Yixuan, who was sealed in the array formation, frowned deeply.

Had he not heard it for himself, he would definitely not believe that there were spies of Yunxiao Sect in Falling Sky Valley!

“No wonder…” Ye Qingtang pondered silently. She was wondering why Yunxiao Sect would be so generous for a disciple to have this many remarkable talismans.

So it was that Yunxiao Sect Sect Master deliberately sent Yue Tiancheng to kill Ji Yixuan and thus handed him those array formations in a talisman. Otherwise, even if Yue Tiancheng was skilled, he was still lacking when facing a genius like Ji Yixuan.

Yunxiao Sect had prepared for all of this long ago. It was not out of luck that Ji Yixuan died in Yue Tiancheng’s hands in her previous life.

“Yunxiao Sect is so shameless to arrange spies in my Falling Sky Valley.” Ji Yixuan criticized angrily as he withstood the force of destruction.

“How dare you!” Before Yue Tiancheng said anything, Ye Qingtang suddenly sneered. “Who do you think you are to insult Yunxiao Sect?”

“Junior sister, there’s no need to waste your saliva on someone who is about to die,” Yue Tiancheng said nonchalantly. Ji Yixuan was destined to be a dead man. What could he do even if he learned of everything?

“Oh right, Senior Brother Yue, what is this person’s motive for coming to Formidable Heavens Dynasty?” Ye Qingtang wore an obedient expression as she looked at Yue Tiancheng curiously.

“Regeneration Stone.” Yue Tiancheng did not hide anything as a white crystal floated in his palm. “This item can renew the bones of a dying person. The days of Falling Sky Valley’s old Valley Master are numbered, and he needs the Regeneration Stone to keep his life. What a pity that their calculations failed. The Regeneration Stone that Ji Yixuan used a Herculean effort to obtain is now in my hands. When I return to the sect and turn it in, it would definitely be a great merit.”

“Senior Brother Yue is indeed amazing. I am full of admiration!” Ye Qingtang cupped her fists as she looked at him in adoration.

“Regeneration Stone…” Ji Yixuan realized that the Regeneration Stone which he hid in a certain corner previously was now in Yue Tiancheng’s hands!

“It seems that there really are spies in my Falling Sky Valley. Otherwise, how would you be able to tail me for days and even find the place where I hid the Regeneration Stone?” Indignation filled Ji Yixuan’s eyes.

He had no regrets even if he died there, but that Regeneration Stone was a life-saving item for the old Valley Master. His master and old Valley Master believed in him and entrusted this heavy responsibility to him, but… he ultimately disappointed both of them.
