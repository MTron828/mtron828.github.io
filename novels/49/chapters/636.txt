“Don’t bullsh*t anymore. Let’s enter the land of inheritance first.”

Ye Qingtang frowned. The leading team had found her, and there would be more powerful people from the super sects that would find their way here. They could not stay at this place for long. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Ye Qingtang led the Blood Moon Elder and entered the giant pagoda in front of them.

“This place is…”

The Blood Moon Elder opened his eyes after a while and scanned around. He was slightly shocked.

The scene inside the pagoda was out of their expectations. There was a small world inside.

This was an ice field with a piercingly cold wind. There were stretches of icy mountains and glaciers.

It was just a giant pagoda from the outside, but when they entered the pagoda, it was a boundless small world.

“This should be the first level.” The white tiger stretched out its head from Ye Qingtang’s arm. It swung its head and sized up the surroundings.

There were three levels in the giant pagoda, and there was weird energy turbulence on the third level.

“Holy Lady, there are definitely treasures on the third level. Let’s rush to the third level and take that treasure!” the Blood Moon Elder said and smiled.

“How do we go to the third level?” Ye Qingtang did not bother about the Blood Moon Elder and looked towards the white tiger instead.

The white tiger was stunned and then said, “How will I know? How many times do I need to tell you that I have never entered the land of inheritance here!”

“For real?” Ye Qingtang did not totally believe it.

“F*ck you, why would lie to you!” The white tiger humphed.

Ye Qingtang could only believe its words and scanned through the surroundings.

Soon, she discovered that there was a staircase a few kilometers away.

The staircase was formed by ice and floating in mid-air, pointing towards the sky.

“That should be the path to the second level…” Ye Qingtang was in thought.

Ye Qingtang did not rush to the staircase. This place was full of danger, and she did not want to move around without caution.

Within half a day when Ye Qingtang was observing the first level, there were at least a thousand people who entered the land of inheritance.

Ye Qingtang hid in a cave and observed the situation for the whole day.

The first level of the pagoda was really like a small world. Nothing changed even after a few thousand people entered the place.

As the white tiger had said, this place was really a land of inheritance. Many people had found rare treasures and even some long-lost skills on the first level.

Of course, the greater the destiny, the higher the risks.

Within a day, there were more than ten people who had died on the first level.

Ye Qingtang frowned deeply in the cave.

From her one-day observations, the bodies of people who died fighting for the places of inheritance turned into blood and flew into the third level.

Ye Qingtang was sure that there must be a huge conspiracy on the third level of the land of inheritance.

However, she could not figure out what the conspiracy was about now.

The next day morning, Ye Qingtang kicked the Blood Moon Elder, who was guarding outside the cave.

“How dare you…” The Blood Moon Elder opened his eyes suddenly and shouted in anger.

However, he was stunned when he saw Ye Qingtang standing behind him.

“Fck you, how dare you to sleep when you’re asked to guard the cave!” The white tiger peeked its head out and looked at the Blood Moon Elder.

“…”

The Blood Moon Elder muttered. “How is it any of your business…”
