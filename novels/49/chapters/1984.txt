Standing behind the mysterious person in the black clothes was a man and a woman. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The man’s complexion was as fair as porcelain and was glowing slightly. He was smiling gently calmly and looked just like a porcelain doll.

Similarly, the woman was mesmerizing as well. She was extremely slender, her waist as small as a clenched fist, and she was in a green, tight-waisted dress which accentuated her slim waist even more. Her face was ethereal. There were two peonies at the edge of her beautiful eyes, which seemed to bloom every time she looked up. They were enough to bewitch anyone looking at her.

They were definitely not human! They were from an alien race.

Xue Fu frowned slightly as he saw the lady from the alien race.

“Why is it her?”

“You know her? Lady Ghost had entered the Temple of Shadows later than Xue Fu, and even though it had still been associated with the Crimson League, they already had very little interaction.

Xue Fu’s expression was strange but he remained silent.

Black mist spread out from their feet as the mutant Wind Snake landed.

The feet of the three of them did not touch the ground as all as the black mist underneath them continued to spread. The Ancient Clan people standing around them suddenly felt a chill that penetrated deep into their bones.

The chill was akin to the coldness of death which seemed to come from within their hearts.

But in an instant, the youngest members of the Ancient Clan who were within the mist suddenly turned pale. Their lips purpled as they knelt to the ground in pain, as though someone was strangling them.

“How is Mo Yao taking care of the Temple of Shadows? How can there be humans here?” The woman looked at the collapsed young people in disgust, as though she was looking at a pile of repulsive ants.

Mo Yao was the Holy Lord of Shadows’s name.

In the entire Temple of Shadows, other than an angry Ming Di, no one dared to call the Holy Lord of Shadows by her name.

“What an eyesore.” The alien race woman lifted her eyes, as she lifted her slim, long fingers slowly, the nails at the end as sharp as blades. With a flick of her fingers, a wisp of glittery mist flew out.

Xue Fu felt an extreme source of foreboding as he saw that but it was too late for him to cry out.

The glittery mist spread all around them. Before the people of the Ancient Clans could even understand what was going on, the mist had dispersed into the air and adhered to their bodies.

In the next second, a vine burst forth from where the mist had stuck to the people and quickly tore one of the men apart.

The strong stench of blood quickly filled the air.

Those who had been touched by the mist all shrieked as though they had seen a ghost. They could all feel something lurking within them, waiting to implode.

“Guardian Xue Fu! Save us!”

Xue Fu’s expression was extremely dark as he heard the tinkling laugh of the alien race lady as she looked at the blood in front of her. He frowned as he suppressed the foreboding feeling in his heart and walked forward.

“Greetings, our three ambassadors.”
