Chapter 632: The True Holy Mother

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang was shocked to hear that. “The people on this mainland joined forces to kill that extraordinary lady, yet she still thought of protecting everyone before she died?”

“Kind heart…” the little white tiger said.

Ye Qingtang was a little speechless. This was no longer because of a kind heart. This was a true holy mother…

“What’s the use of the Dimension Wall…” Ye Qingtang mumbled.

“It’s actually very simple. The people on this mainland could leave easily, but outsiders would not be able to enter. This is the use of the Dimension Wall,” the little white tiger said.

“That’s not right…”

Ye Qingtang shook her head. “If that’s the case, how did the Blood Moon Holy Lord pass through the Dimension Wall and enter this mainland?”

Calculating the time, it had been probably two thousand years since the death of that extraordinary lady.

It was said that the Blood Moon Holy Lord was an outsider who entered this mainland. If it was like what the little white tiger said, it should have been impossible for the Blood Moon Holy Lord to enter this mainland.

The little white tiger sighed. “I’ve told you eight hundred times to stay away from that Blood Moon Holy Lord. Do you think the Blood Moon Holy Lord that you see… Anyways, the Dimension Wall does not have any effect on the Blood Moon Holy Lord.”

The little white tiger stopped talking after that instant. No matter how Ye Qingtang pressed it for an answer, it kept its mouth shut and did not utter a single word.

“Little moron! How dare you insult the Holy Lord?!” The Blood Moon Elder looked as if he wanted to kill the little white tiger.

“F*ck you. When have I ever insulted the Blood Moon Holy Lord? Get lost, damn woman.” The little white tiger spat at the Blood Moon Elder.

The Blood Moon Elder hollered. “Fuck you!”

The little white tiger screamed. “Fuck you!”

Ye Qingtang stopped the human and tiger from swearing at each other and was in deep thought alone.

The Dimension Wall could prevent outsiders from entering this mainland…

Ye Qingtang racked her brains hard but still could not think of what this had to do with her and the black-robed person divulging news of her.

However, it was fortunate that those powerful figures were a distance away from the Evil Spirits Realm and still required a period of time to rush here.

Currently, Ye Qingtang only had two options.

The first option was to stay away from the land of inheritance.

The second was to continue heading toward the land of inheritance.

Logically, the proper thing to do was to stay away from this place now that her location was revealed.

But thinking from another perspective, if that was really the case, she would be further away from the truth. Perhaps, she might not even know why she died in the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm.

Ultimately, Ye Qingtang decided to head to the land of inheritance. She believed that the black-robed person would appear again!

“Holy Lady, what’s there to be afraid of! Nowhere in this Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm is safe. Let’s enter the land of inheritance first to obtain the inheritance and increase our skills. When those people come, we’ll kill all of them. Won’t that feel nice!” The Blood Moon Elder egged her on.

As an elder of Blood Moon Sect, the number one evil sect in this mainland, he naturally did not like those from the so-called righteous path and wished he could kill all of them.

“Go!” Ye Qingtang did not say anything else and entered the Evil Spirits Realm immediately with the Blood Moon Elder.

What laid ahead of them was a patch of blood-red. There was lots of mist inside, and the visibility was only several meters.

“Careful. The Evil Spirits Realm is the scariest place in the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm,” the little white tiger suddenly said.

After hearing that, Ye Qingtang frowned slightly.

She clearly remembered that this was not what the little white tiger told her initially… 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Be careful, Holy Lady. There is definitely something odd about this place!” the Blood Moon Elder said.
