Chapter 1868: Guest From the Second Domain (2)

“Apologies, I’m not interested,” Ye Qingtang shook her head as she declined politely.

The girl hadn’t expected Ye Qingtang to reject her so quickly. Seeing that the sky was slowly turning brighter, she couldn’t help but feel worried.

“Hold on, it’s fine if you don’t want to take the money. What about Dharma artifacts or elixirs? I’ll give you anything you want in exchange for the spirit stones. Just name it.”

The girl was talking big!

Ye Qingtang was amused by the girl’s crude ways.

If they weren’t in the mystic realm, Ye Qingtang would definitely agree to exchange the spirit stones for the Dharma artifacts and elixirs. However, after learning that the spirit stones could be used in cultivation, such material possession no longer interested her anymore.

Nothing mattered more than making herself more powerful.

“I’m sorry, I’m not interested in the things you’re offering.”

“You!” The girl’s face stiffened, stomping her feet angrily as she shouted, “I don’t care, you must exchange them with me!”

“...” Ye Qingtang shook her head as she watched the girl throw a tantrum.

Not wanting to bother with the girl any longer, she took Jiang Shaobai and Little White Tiger with her into the Crystal Palace.

The tall man frowned as he looked at the skies. He stepped forward, putting away the money and taking out two bottles of elixirs from the space ring.

“Miss, Young Miss is young and insensible. Everything happened suddenly and we don’t have enough time to prepare the spirit stones needed. We know that it’s very dangerous here in the day and I was wondering if you could show mercy and exchange some spirit stones with us. These two bottles of Miracle Pills are a token of appreciation for you. I will make sure to return the entire sum of spirit stones after tonight.”

The man’s voice was deep but his words were extremely pleasant to the ears.

Ye Qingtang wasn’t intending to be nosey but when she heard the words ‘Miracle Pills’, she froze.

Miracle Pills?

Wasn’t that a supreme-grade elixir that only existed in the Second Domain?

When Ye Qingtang looked at the two of them carefully again, she noticed that the man had an oppressive aura, though it was quite subtle. She was stunned.

This man’s skills... he was at the Paragon level!

Hearing how the man addressed the girl, he obviously held the position of a bodyguard.

A Holy Venerate who could easily take out two bottles of Miracle Pills, how could he be a mere bodyguard?

Although Ye Qingtang was surprised by their identities, she tried her best to not show it. She had only heard of the Miracle Pills, which is a supreme-grade elixir in the Second Domain in her previous life.

Such an elixir would allow one to achieve remarkable progress in cultivation in a short amount of period. Moreover, the elixir would boost one’s performance, no matter the cultivation type. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The Miracle Pills was said to be a portable sacred item for cultivation. Even powerful clans in the Second Domain wouldn’t be able to easily land their hands on it.

Where exactly did these two people come from?

Though Ye Qingtang had planned to keep the spirit stones for her cultivation, if she could land her hands on the Miracle Pills and have it act as a complement to the spirit stones, it would increase the effects of her cultivation efforts.

It was tempting.

“You’ll return me the spirit stones tomorrow?” Ye Qingtang pretended to be calm as she asked.

The man nodded.

“Fine, how many do you need?”

Who cared about that girl’s nasty temper. This Holy Venerate was way more pleasant and his offers were far more attractive to Ye Qingtang.
