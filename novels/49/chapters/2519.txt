Chapter 2520: Dog Is Angry (3)

Ye Qingtang glanced at the Blood Moon Elder. The Blood Moon Elder felt helpless, but Ye Qingtang felt even more helpless than him. Currently, the Blood Moon Elder was probably even lousier than a cripple. When she had time in the future, she must improve the Blood Moon Elder’s skills first, otherwise, there was no way that he could defeat anyone. The way he was now, he could not even protect himself.

Seeing that the Blood Moon Elder still wanted to say something, Ye Qingtang hurriedly said, “Alright, I am the Holy Lady. Just listen to me.”

In the end, the Blood Moon Elder could only nod his head. Although he wanted to help, he could not do anything. Since his abilities did not allow him to help, he had no choice.

Very quickly, Ye Qingtang’s gaze landed on the golden book elder. She smiled and said, “Senior, I’ll go with you. However, I want to ask why your Lord wants to see me… Did I offend him in the Wailing Well? Or was there some misunderstanding?”

Ye Qingtang only wanted to get some information from the old man. What if she managed to get something out of him? Wouldn’t that be a gain?

Currently, Ye Qingtang knew nothing about the identities of these people. The enemy was hidden while she was standing exposed in the light. She did not even know the other party’s identity. This made Ye Qingtang uncomfortable.

“Heh, there’s no need to say any more nonsense. How dare you question my Lord? You just have to obediently do as he says. As for your life or death, I can’t decide it, and neither can you. It can only be decided by my Lord. Do you understand!?” The elder snapped caustically.

“Fine, fine. I understand. You guys are all very impressive.” Ye Qingtang gave the old man a thumbs up. Who was the one who spoiled this old man to the point that he was this arrogant? Did he really think he was the messenger of God?

Ye Qingtang sneered secretly. Just let them be arrogant for a while longer. If they were lucky, they could directly enter the Deity Ocean realm and throw them all into the pile of demons. Let them keep up this arrogance with those cruel demons. Let’s see if the demons in the Deity Ocean realm would buy their act.

“Sir, do we need to tie them up?”

A middle-aged man behind the golden book elder asked.

“There’s no need for that.” The elder spoke calmly, “He’s merely a mid-stage Divine Lord. Do we need to treat him so seriously? Are you afraid that he will escape from our hands?”

The middle-aged man nodded respectfully. “You’re right, sir. I shouldn’t have said anything.”

“Let’s go. Do I need to invite you?” The golden book elder looked at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang was expressionless as she said, “Alright. In that case, lead the way, Senior. I also want to know who this great lord revived from the Wailing Well is.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Just as Ye Qingtang was about to step forward, a bark of cold laughter came from behind.

…

“Little b*tch, I never expected to meet you here. So it’s true that mortal enemies are always destined to meet.”

Several figures appeared in a flash.

Ye Qingtang frowned. This lady…

Ye Qingtang was familiar with the lady who spoke. When the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix was passed down, this lady in green was present and Ye Qingtang’s Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline was also taken from her…

This was the original owner of the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline…

Ye Qingtang remembered that when she was still in the Jiang family and entered the Land of Infinite Demons, she had seen this lady in green with an elder..
