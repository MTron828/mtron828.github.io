“No wonder... people called this place a forbidden land where one will face absolute death...” Ye Qingtang organized the rough clues and finally understood the situation before her.

It was likely that ever since this group of powerful figures disappeared, this forbidden land was feared in the mainland as a place of absolute death, and no one dared to enter it. Even if a fearless person entered it by coincidence, he would probably be killed at the border by the black lines and demons, thus making it simply impossible to reach this place, much less learn about Jiang Yu’s situation.

After understanding everything, Ye Qingtang was extremely conflicted as she looked at the group of children before her.

The powerful figures of various territories in the past are a bunch of kids now?

Who can believe it if this news is spread around?

“Damn it. I have been locked in here for thousands of years. Why do I not see any juniors from my clan coming to rescue me?” A child furrowed his brows like an old man and grunted. “My hair has already turned white from the wait.”

Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched as she looked silently at the little kid with baby hair.

And he’s still waiting for people to rescue him...

Over the thousands of years, this place had long become forbidden to enter. If the Jiang Family people were not after her life, she would never run into this damn place no matter what.

“Ah choo...”

Just as Ye Qingtang was observing secretly, the leader of the three demonic bears that had been following her sneezed after being drenched in water.

The clear sound reverberated in the cave for a long time.

For a moment, all the children stopped whatever they were doing, and they uniformly looked at the corner that they ignored before.

Ye Qingtang was exposed before these “supreme powerful figures” just like that.

“...”

The group of powerful figures, who had not seen an outside person for a long time, suddenly saw three young demonic bears and a slim lady whose body was dripping with blood.

Ye Qingtang instinctively wanted to escape.

She had just turned around and was about to run away when Emperor Yan, who was the most aggressive one earlier on, kicked Xiong Yan away and bolted to the edge of the array formation. Stretching his stubby hand out, he shouted furiously.

“Stop right there!”

This holler seemed to be full of force, but it came out from the mouth of a four-year-old kid and sounded extremely childlike and soft.

Before Emperor Yan could put on an imposing manner, he was kicked to a side by another child.

The child who kicked Emperor Yan looked at Ye Qingtang with a serious expression immediately.

“Junior, please stay.”

“Don’t be long-winded. Little girl, release me if you don’t wish to die!” Emperor Yan, who was kicked, had a fierce look on his young face.

“...” Ye Qingtang glanced at the adorably fierce kid that was Emperor Yan.

Really...

Not scary at all.

Strangely gives one the urge to squish his cheeks.

“Junior, we have been trapped here for a long time. Can we trouble you to close this boundary so that we can get out?” Not everyone put on airs from before like Emperor Yan; some powerful figures understood the situation clearly and asked politely.

“Are you all locked here by the gods?” Ye Qingtang voiced her previous guess.

The children nodded.

“Jiang Yu destroyed the temple back then. The gods were furious and laid a curse on this area and trapped us within this boundary...”

The truth was not far off from Ye Qingtang’s guess—all of these people were locked within the boundary by the gods and were cursed with the Age Reversal Curse.
