Chapter 1062 Shameless (1)

Although the Ye Family members were surprised, Ye Qingtang did not explain to them, and the Branch Masters and elders did not dare to ask further.

After killing Elder Qu, Ye Qingtang bade farewell to the Ye Family members and informed Elder Bai Kui to bring Ye Ling and the other three elders of the Ye Family to Yunxiao Sect. Afterward, she left the Formidable Heavens Dynasty and flew towards the Nine Nights Dynasty.

It had been a long time since she left Falling Sky Valley, and it was now time she settled the matters there.

Currently, Falling Sky Valley had internal and external troubles. Not only did Perfected Xuanchen have to face the other Peak Masters, but he was even pressured by the Peerless School. Ye Qingtang’s return to the Nine Nights Dynasty was none other than to resolve Falling Sky Valley’s conflict.

In the sky, at the boundary of the Formidable Heavens Dynasty.

Ye Qingtang slowed down instantly as she looked behind her.

At this instant, two extremely powerful auras were flying towards her at lightning speed.

After sensing these two powerful auras, Ye Qingtang inspected her back.

In two breaths’ time, these two auras were increasingly near, and two elderlies arrived at the spot in a flash.

These two elderlies were similar in age. Looking at their outfits, they did not seem to be from sects. However, their auras resembled that of strong waves that swept across the surroundings; they were at least at the Yang Lord level.

“Little girl, you run really fast.”

One of the white-robed elderlies sized up Ye Qingtang for a moment, and shock emerged in his eyes as he commented with a laugh.

Ye Qingtang similarly sized up the two elderlies who suddenly arrived and blocked her way.

With the cultivation base of a Yang Lord and the fact that they appeared in the Formidable Heavens Dynasty, one did not need to think much to know that they were from Beiming Manor.

“May I know what you two stopped me for?” Ye Qingtang looked at the two elderlies and said.

After hearing Ye Qingtang, one of the elderlies said, “Little child, I heard that you annihilated Yunxiao Sect.”

“That’s right,” Ye Qingtang said bluntly without waiting for the elderly to continue.

Both elderlies were slightly stunned when they heard Ye Qingtang admitting it so straightforwardly. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Little girl, do you know that Yunxiao Sect is a super sect that is an affiliate of Beiming Manor? By annihilating Yunxiao Sect, it is equivalent to opposing Beiming Manor,” the Beiming Manor elderly looked at Ye Qingtang and said with a smile.

“You two can just state your reason for being here. There’s no need to beat around the bush,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Haha… Little girl, you’re rather young, but you have quite a temper.” Another elderly sneered.

“I have a deep-seated hatred with Yunxiao Sect. It is right that Yunxiao Sect is annihilated by me when its skills are lower than mine. Yet, you two are blocking my way and calling me arrogant,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Oh?” The Beiming Manor elderly snickered. “In that case, Yunxiao Sect is rightly annihilated by you since its skills are lower than yours. So, is it right that you’re killed by us if your skills are lower than us?”

“If you all have the ability, why not give it a try?” Ye Qingtang cast a look at the two people and said coldly.

“Haha, there’s no hurry.” Another elderly laughed. “Little girl, you’re so young, but you’re already a Yang Lord. Our Beiming Manor is one of the three mighty forces of this mainland. We pay great attention to powerful talents. Given your skills, you can completely join Beiming Manor, become an Elder, and have the same status as us. How’s that?”
