Chapter 558 We Will Meet Again Some Day (3)

They did not think there would actually be so many accidents in annihilating an ordinary sect. Not only did the Blood Moon Sect appear, but the other two super sects were also attracted over as well. Yet, the real reason that Yunxiao Sect wanted to annihilate Xuanling Sect for must absolutely not be told to these two super sects.

“I’m afraid you all are mistaken.”

Just as the Yunxiao Sect elders were at a loss of how to make up a plausible story, Ye You, who was beside Li Chenfeng, suddenly took a step forward and said slowly, “The reason that we came to Xuanling Sect today is because a Xuanling Sect disciple killed several Yunxiao Sect disciples and heavily injured dozens of disciples. Hence, we wanted Xuanling Sect to hand the person over. Who knew that not only did they disobey our orders, they even protected the murderer and revolted as a group without giving our Yunxiao Sect any respect. Such a disrespectful sect should, of course, be annihilated.”

A Yuehua Sect elder scoffed. “Xuanling Sect is actually so presumptuous!”

The super sects simply did not care about ordinary sects as the difference between them was like a chasm. For a Xuanling Sect disciple to kill a super sect’s disciple, it was undoubtedly a case of the low-ranked offending the high-ranked. A super sect’s dignity was offended, and Xuanling Sect’s protection was all the more absurd.

“Nonsense!”

Suddenly, Elder Qin shouted from below. “Fellow Yuehua Sect and Lingyun Sect people, actually, Yunxiao Sect came to annihilate Xuanling Sect because we discovered their ugly face that has been kept hidden from the world!”

“Shut up!”

Li Chenfeng glared at Elder Qin furiously.

“Shut up?” Before Elder Qin spoke, Qin Huan suddenly stood up and shouted, “The one who should shut up is you, this shameless old fellow!”

“What did you say?” A cold glint flashed across Li Chenfeng’s eyes.

“Why? Do you want to scare me? Come, Come and hit me.” Qin Huan’s left hand was on his waist and waved to Li Chenfeng with his right hand. “Come, come, come. Come in and kill me.”

Looking at Qin Huan’s provoking stance, Zhu Changge, Feng Moli, and the rest were speechless.

Xuanling Sect was enshrouded in the Blood Moon Holy Lord’s divine power, and no one dared to charge in.

Yunxiao Sect long wanted to annihilate Xuanling Sect, and hence, Xuanling Sect would not be polite to them at all.

However…

Qin Huan’s provocation was truly savage. It vented their anger as well!

“Come! Come over here!” Zhu Changge echoed after Qin Huan and shouted loudly. “You can come over here and kill us!”

Yunxiao Sect masses clenched their teeth, but they were helpless.

Speaking of Yunxiao Sect’s scandal, the Yuehua Sect Master’s interest was piqued. “Why don’t you say what scandal Yunxiao Sect has?”

“Yuehua Sect Master, Yunxiao Sect possesses the evil technique of snatching one’s spirit root. They placed their sect disciples in different sects and snatched the spirit roots of other sects’ disciples!” Elder Mo replied.

“WHAT?!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

After hearing the words, the expressions of the high-ranking executives in Yuehua Sect and Lingyun Sect changed immediately.

Snatching others’ spirit root was a martial Dao taboo! It was regarded as shameless by everyone in the world!

“After we discovered this scandal, Yunxiao Sect came to silence us.” Xuanling Sect Master replied.

“Rubbish!” A Yunxiao Sect elder scoffed. “You all must not believe these cunning people. How would our Yunxiao Sect commit such an evil act!”

Both Yuehua Sect and Lingyun Sect were in thought.

Previously, they had already found the excuse that Yunxiao Sect used to annihilate Xuanling Sect a little superficial. After listening to Xuanling Sect’s argument, it did not seem like a lie either… Otherwise, why would Yunxiao Sect bring such a large army and even deploy the divine beast just to get an explanation from a disciple?
