Chapter 2036: Chaos (4)

Ling Yan looked at her. Under the light, he could see himself reflected in her eyes.

“Miss Ye. You don’t have to know how much I know. All you need to know is that no matter what, I will always be on your side.”

Ye Qingtang looked surprised as she gazed at him in the dim light. In terms of his looks, he really was the most beautiful person she had ever seen in her life.

She never cared about a person’s look but Ling Yan looked especially beautiful today.

“Miss Ye, I’m not sure what I’m going to do if you keep looking at me like this,” he said with a light laugh.

She was jolted back to reality by his words.

“Do you want to die?” she asked as she twisted her lips.

Ling Yan covered his mouth and rocked with silent laughter.

Ye Qingtang quickly looked away to dispel those thoughts from her mind. Taking the Spirit of Chaos fragments from her space ring, she placed them into the vessel.

Every fragment she placed in the vessel would shine with light, then float up to merge with the other fragments. The scattered fragments gradually formed an incomplete hemisphere.

She realized after placing all the fragments in the vessel that a few pieces were lying inside it.

They were neither shining nor floating up and did not look any different from what they had been.

“Are these few fragments... spoiled?” she asked curiously.

Ling Yan looked at the fragments and took them out of the container before taking Ye Qingtang’s hand smoothly and placing the fragments in her palm.

“These fragments are fake.”

“Fake?” Ye Qingtang was taken aback.

Ling Yan smiled and said, “When the Spirit of Chaos was shattered, the fragments were indeed divided up among the Ancient Clans. But there were many clans in the Central Mainland and not everyone managed to get their hands on a fragment. Furthermore, it has been a long time since the fragments first appeared. In that time, many clans have disappeared and their fragments have either ended up in the clutches of the other clans or other forces...

“There are even some clans with two to three fragments and some of them have used these fragments in exchange for favors. In order not to stir up suspicion, they created fake fragments.”

“If those fragments were fake, why didn’t they just confess to the Ancient You Clan?” Ye Qingtang didn’t understand why they hadn’t just confessed that their fragments were fake and spared themselves the slaughter that was happening because of the fragments.

But she arrived at the answer as soon as the words were out of her mouth.

This was the same as how she had used a fake Netherworld Ring to provoke the Crimson League...

Even if they confessed that their fragments were fake and handed them over to the Ancient You Clan, the clan might not have believed them. They would rather kill off thousands of them than spare a single person.

“I see that Miss Ye understands as well,” Ling Yan said with a smile.

“There’s no way that they can differentiate between the real and fake fragments without the vessel. The Spirit of Chaos fragments don’t emit any energy after all.”
