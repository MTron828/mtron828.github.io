Ye Qingtang lightly hugged the tiny frame that never stopped trembling, and her brows furrowed.

“It’s all over. I am back already. No one can ever harm you again.”

Ni Shang clutched onto Ye Qingtang’s clothes tightly and choked in between sobs. No one could imagine what kind of suffering she went through in these few days.

Ye Qingtang’s heart ached as she pacified the young girl. Rage gradually flamed up within her as she felt a warm sensation on her blouse due to Ni Shang’s tears.

In the room, Ni Shang’s cries traveled out from the cracks of the door. Upon hearing Ni Shang’s heartbreaking cries, Fei Ying, who was sitting outside the door, felt as if a knife was pierced in his heart. He clenched his teeth and punched the hard rock ground. Even though his knuckles were bleeding badly, it never suppressed the excruciating pain in his heart.

Ni Shang cried for a long time. With her age, how difficult must it have been for her to go through those three days of torture?

She mumbled the torture she experienced in these few days in choppy sentences.

The more Ye Qingtang listened, the more the murderous feeling in her intensified.

In her previous life, Ni Shang did not meet Ye Qingtang and did not have the slightest ability to protect herself, thus ending up being tortured to death.

But this time, the only lucky thing was that Ni Shang was never really humiliated by those three bastards. Before this, the cultivation techniques that Ye Qingtang taught Ni Shang protected Ni Shang’s last thread of dignity. While she was unable to escape, she resisted desperately and never allowed the three disciples to have their way, though the number of beatings she suffered from the resistance was not little.

Ni Shang was exhausted from crying, and her originally frail body could not support itself. Between sobs, she eventually fell into a deep slumber in Ye Qingtang’s arms.

However, there no longer was neither pain nor despair on Ni Shang’s face this time.

She knew that Miss was back, and she was finally safe.

Ye Qingtang gently settled Ni Shang in bed and left the room.

There was a faint smell of blood outside. There were no emotions on her face when she saw Fei Ying, who collapsed outside the door, and his badly battered fists, which left a trail of blood on the ground

“Do you hate it?” Ye Qingtang asked with a low voice.

Fei Ying looked down and nodded firmly.

“Become stronger then. Strong enough to protect the people around you and never let them suffer again. Otherwise, even if you kill yourself from the hatred, it would only be a joke to those people,” Ye Qingtang said coldly.

Fei Ying suddenly looked up. In the dark night, his bright yet sharp eyes were like knives from which the innocence belonging to a young teen was completely absent.

“Miss, I wish to become stronger!”

Ye Qingtang chuckled and nodded.

“I will teach you after the Life and Death Ring. Before that, you must take good care of Ni Shang. Do you hear me?” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Yes!” Fei Ying gave a firm nod, but worry suddenly emerged in his heart. “Miss, that Life and Death Ring…”

“I know my limits.” Afterward, Ye Qingtang returned to her own room.

Ni Shang’s injuries weighed heavily on Ye Qingtang’s heart. She was clearly aware that her current skills were not considered the top amongst the inner sect disciples, but she must avenge Ni Shang without a doubt!

There were still ten days left…

She must make a breakthrough in these ten days. Otherwise, even if she went on the Life and Death Ring, she would be the one who died.

In her room, her eyes narrowed as she thought of the Life and Death Ring that was going to happen ten days later.

Ten days…
