Chapter 1995: Truth and Lies (2)

A holy artifact as powerful as the Netherworld Ring had to be passed on to the Clan Leader. Elder Mo had no intention of keeping it.

Just as the Ancient You Clan was celebrating their successful robbing of the Temple of Shadows, the deadline that the Crimson League had given the temple passed silently.

Lady Ghost and several other people were busy organizing the latest information within the Temple of Shadows when a loud sound came from the outside. Lady Ghost’s expression changed slightly but before she could step out of the main hall, a gust of wind blasted in.

“Mo Yao, get out here at once!” Bai Zhi rushed into the main hall on the black mist. Her beautiful face was contorted in anger.

“Lady Bai Zhi, what do you think you’re doing?” Lady Ghost recognized her but had no idea what she was doing here.

Without even looking at Lady Ghost, Bai Zhi raised her hand and a tendril of smoke flew towards Lady Ghost and wrapped around her neck, lifting her into the air.

“Mo Yao, you’d better get out here at once, or I will make sure to slaughter the entire Undead Clan in the Temple of Shadows and raze this entire place to the ground!” Bai Zhi exclaimed coldly as a strong force enveloped the Temple of Shadows. Her voice was transmitted to every corner of the Temple of Shadows.

The Ancient Clan who had suffered in her hands all trembled as they heard her angry voice and none of them dared leave their spot.

This devil wasn’t someone they could deal with.

Under the wrath of Bai Zhi, Ye Qingtang walked out of the temple tith Ming Wang and the eight tribe leaders. The faces of the eight tribe leaders all drooped as they saw Lady Ghost in the clutches of Bai Zhi.

“Bai Zhi, what is the meaning of this?”

Bai Zhi looked at Ye Qingtang, who was in the lead, her expression extremely frosty.

“What is the meaning of this? Mo Yao, this should be a question for you! Your seven days are out yet you still refuse to hand over the Netherworld Ring. Do you really think that the Crimson League wouldn’t dare to touch the Temple of Shadows?”

“Bai Zhi, don’t you dare come here spewing lies at us! Our Holy Lord has already sent the Guardian to personally deliver the Netherworld Ring to the Frost Abyss yesterday,” the Demon Tribe Leader retorted.

“What a joke. You think we’re just going to take your words as truth? Why haven’t I seen the Netherworld Ring then?” Bai Zhi sneered coldly before she looked straight at Ye Qingtang and continued, “The Crimson League demands the Netherworld Ring. Since you are not willing to hand it over nicely, don’t blame me for going all out.”

Seeing that Bai Zhi was about to make a move, Ye Qingtang who had been quiet all this time suddenly spoke.

“You didn’t receive the Netherworld Ring?”

“What rubbish are you spouting? Why else would I come here then?” Bai Zhi said with a cold smile.

Ye Qingtang pretended to have a confused look on her face.

“Bai Zhi, I don’t care what you think, but since I’ve already promised to deliver the Netherworld Ring to the Crimson League, I wouldn’t go back on my word. Do you really think that I would destroy my relationship with the Crimson League just for the Netherworld Ring?”

She paused for a moment before continuing.

“I did send several men off to deliver the Netherworld Ring to the Frost Abyss yesterday. Perhaps they mistook the time. You can go back to the Frost Abyss to see for yourself.”

“Do you think I’m an idiot?” Bai Zhi asked. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Whether you believe me is up to you. The Temple of Shadows is here after all, and it’s not going anywhere,” Ye Qingtang said.

You can ask around yourself. It’s my loss if you actually find the ring.

When Bai Zhi saw how calm and confident Ye Qingtang was, a sliver of doubt entered her mind.
