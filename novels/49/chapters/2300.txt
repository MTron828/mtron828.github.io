Chapter 2301: Selection Trials (4)

“Damn, I’m really curious now. What kind of god-like teacher has the confidence to send such students to the Inter-Academy Competition?”

“Don’t tell me an Emperor level practitioner came to our academy to be a teacher?”

The teenagers continued their discussion.

Someone who dared to make such a bold claim. Either he possessed out-of-this-world powers or he was just a mad man.

Meng Yao was only too happy to tell everyone the truth.

“Emperor level practitioner? If he was really an Emperor level practitioner, Lei Yan and his gang would be in luck. A pity that… this Teacher Ye is just a Paragon Sixth Heaven level.”

“What? Paragon Sixth Heaven level? Are you joking? How can such a person become a teacher at the Netherworld Academy?”

“Damn, I heard of something like this earlier. I thought it was just a baseless rumor. Didn’t expect it to be true.”

“A Paragon Sixth Heaven level teacher wants to send this bunch of losers to the Inter-Academy Competition? Are you kidding me? I think he must be crazy.”

“What does he think this Inter-Academy Competition is? And what does he take us for? With abilities like his… if he can send Lei Yan and his gang to the Inter-Academy Competition, I will swallow the sword in my hand!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“He dares to make such a bold claim? Who would believe him?”

The minds of the students were truly blown. Never had they seen such a crazy, shameless person before.

It was fine to make arrogant statements if you had some abilities. But this fellow was a loser with equally useless students under him. Who knew how he managed to wrangle his way into the school?

Seeing that she had achieved her aim, Meng Yao left with a smile. But before leaving, she didn’t forget to add something.

“Oh yes, that Teacher Ye brought his students out of the academy for over two months, claiming that it was for external training. As a result, he made a bet with Teacher Di Nuo that if he cannot send his students to the Inter-Academy Competition, he would crawl out of the Netherworld Academy with his tail between his legs. We will be able to enjoy a good spectacle soon.”

With that, Meng Yao left with her cronies in tow.

Everyone was in shock.

Quite a number of students pestered the Leiting family youths, asking if Meng Yao’s words were true.

The Leiting family youths were also bewildered. They had no idea that Ye Qing would be so crazy, making such a ridiculous bet. They didn’t care if Lei Yan wanted to fool around with that useless teacher, but they were now implicated as well.

“We don’t know anything. Go and ask Lei Yan yourselves.” The youths didn’t want to say too much. Just standing there made them feel antsy and they quickly fled.

On the high platform of the arena, Qin Xuan was standing beside Gu Wei. He looked calm with the hint of a smile upon his lips.

“Qin Xuan, have you made all the necessary preparations?” Gu Wei looked impassively at Qin Xuan.

Qin Xuan had finally broken through to the Divine Lord level a few days ago. His powers had surged and this made Gu Wei feel very assured.

With Qin Xuan’s powers, he was already one of the top talents in the Netherworld Academy. In the entire Netherworld Academy, less than ten teenagers had reached the Divine Lord level.

“Master, please don’t worry. I have prepared everything,” Qin Xuan replied respectfully.

Gu Wei nodded.

Few students had caught his eye over the past several years. There were only two whom he had been willing to take under his wing.

First was Qin Feng. Gu Wei had thought very highly of Qin Feng and was prepared to groom him into Netherworld Academy’s top student. But after investing so much effort, he ended up with nothing at all.
