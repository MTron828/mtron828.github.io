Chapter 1134: This Is Impossible (3)

A thousand years ago, he was manifested by the elderly to follow and serve the Blood Moon Holy Lord for eternity without betrayal…

They came to this mainland to search for a lady… and it was said that that lady was the reincarnation of the Heavenly Emperor’s wife…

Once the Heavenly Emperor’s wife reincarnated and appeared, they were to kill her; this was the only purpose of their existence…

However, time passed, and the reincarnation had yet to appear. A thousand years caused them to gradually forget their initial memories…

“Blood Moon Holy Lord…” Blood Moon Elder quivered slightly. “Holy Lord… is the mental manifestation of the Heavenly Emperor… I… I am a split self of the Heavenly Emperor’s warrior… The purpose of our existence… is… is to kill…”

Blood Moon Elder trembled even more intensely, and the last few words were trapped in his mouth. Just as he was about to say them, his eyes landed straight on Ye Qingtang.

“Why… is it you… Why… is the person to kill…”

“What are you saying?”

Ye Qingtang was filled with surprise as she looked at the Blood Moon Elder. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“It seems that you finally recalled your mission.” The virtual elderly looked at the Blood Moon Elder and said without emotions, “Since that’s the case, what are you still waiting for? This lady is heavily injured. Kill her now and your mission is considered completed.”

“The purpose… of my existence…”

The Blood Moon Elder trembled as he looked at Ye Qingtang.

The very purpose of his existence was to wait for the lady before him to be born and then kill her…

“I don’t have a choice… I don’t have a choice ever since I exist in this world…” The Blood Moon Elder’s eyes dimmed gradually as though there was no warmth, and he approached Ye Qingtang slowly.

When he was just several inches away from Ye Qingtang, the Blood Moon Elder suddenly turned around and slashed his sword at the elderly in the air.

However, the elderly was manifested by pure mental energy, and the Blood Moon Elder’s attack did not harm the elderly at all.

“On what basis do I not have any choice?!” The Blood Moon Elder’s eyes were suddenly bright as he shouted sternly. “I have my own thinking… experiences, emotions… and memory. I’m completely independent. Why do I need to be instructed by you? On what basis should I be an insignificant split self of you?! If I can kill you… I can replace you…!”

The virtual elderly was aloof when he heard the Blood Moon Elder and scoffed loudly. “You’re merely my split self… How dare you betray me and even think of replacing me… Forget it, since this is so, there’s no point for you to exist anymore. Disappear.”

The virtual elderly raised his arm gently.

As the elderly moved, the Blood Moon Elder uttered a piercing scream as though his spirit was experiencing unbearable torment.

From afar, Ye Qingtang frowned at the situation before her.

At her peak, she was once a Holy Venerate and naturally knew how to collect a split self back. All there was to do was to use one’s own mental energy to invade into the split self’s body.

Evidently, that elderly wanted to collect the Blood Moon Elder split self back at this moment.
