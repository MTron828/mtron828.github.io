1387 Difficult to Refuse Such Kindness 1

The believers who still could not make sense of the situation finally understood everything.

The Dragon Court Sect which they laid their belief in was the true quack while that Immortal Su was the true immortal!

The fury of being fooled spread riled up in their hearts instantly, but they did not dare to act rashly before Ye Qingtang.

“Please forgive me, Immortal. I dare not do it again,” the elderly stammered.

“The person who you should seek forgiveness from is not me but them.” Ye Qingtang’s objective was to expose the Dragon Court Sect’s fraud, and she did not have the time to punish him.

The elderly’s expression froze, and a chill ran down his spine when he glanced at the believers around him, who wanted to devour him alive.

However strong these believers worshiped the Dragon Court Sect, however intense their resentment toward him was.

The Emperors had the most hatred as they had viewed the Dragon Court Sect as the supreme faith and even lowered their own position before the Dragon Court Sect.

No Emperor was easy to interact with, and their past submission was merely toward immortals.

Yet they were facing a swindler right now… 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

After Ye Qingtang showed her intention to not interfere with the Dragon Court Sect matters, the Emperors who were long annoyed completely erupted in fury.

Apart from the Emperors, many renowned powerful figures on this mainland were fooled as well.

They were ultimately riled up at this moment and vented all their anger on everyone in the Dragon Court Sect.

“Don’t let them escape! Capture everyone in the Dragon Court Sect and those fake believers that were in collusion with them!” An Emperor bellowed, and the Dragon Court Sect ambassadors who attempted to use this opportunity to flee knew that there was trouble.

There were many believers, including many powerful figures.

The Dragon Court Sect had been deceiving everyone with a cover-up and did not have any real abilities. In no time, everyone from the Dragon Court Sect on the floating island was captured by the infuriated believers. After tying all of them up, they were thrown into an empty palace in a corner of the floating island.

Yet, even after doing so, the masses’ anger of being fooled did not dissipate.

The Dragon Court Sect’s prestige had been established in this mainland for a long time, and all Emperors and powerful figures fought to be the most faithful believer.

But now…

The entire Dragon Court Sect was a scam. If this news was spread out, how could these Emperors and powerful figures face the world?

Did they have to tell everyone in the world that they were a bunch of blind fools?

Such humiliation could not be erased even if they killed the entire Dragon Court Sect.

Yet, after venting their anger, everyone seemed to have lost their mainstay as shame, and resentment was written all over their faces.

Ye Qingtang watched the chaos on the white tiger’s back. After exposing the Dragon Court Sect’s pretense, she did not say anything further and watched everything silently as though all of that had nothing to do with her.

“Immortal Su, it is all thanks to you today. The Dragon Court Sect behaved tyrannically on our mainland for such a long time and deceived plenty of people. It is fortunate that you are here to expose their schemes.” The Yuan Emperor looked at Ye Qingtang with reverence and admiration.

“I have long suspected that there was something fishy with this Dragon Court Sect; thus, I did not get too close to them all this time. I am here because I knew that you would definitely be able to tell their trickery with your sharp eyes, Immortal Su.” The Yuan Emperor was relatively joyous, and his words were more than sweet.
