Su Wan was confident that she could conquer Yun Shu bit by bit, but…

She never thought that Ye Qingtang would come back so quickly. She originally thought that Ye Qingtang would take at least half a month before returning, but seeing her again now made her furious already.

However, Su Wan was very smart to not show this anger on her face and could only hide away all the hatred in her eyes as she followed Yun Shu’s gaze. She said gently, “I have not returned to the room today and didn’t know that Junior Sister Ye came back.”

Then, Su Wan looked at Senior Brother Yun’s handsome side profile and smiled faintly. “Senior Brother Yun kept worrying about Junior Sister Ye’s safety all this time. Now, it seems that Junior Sister Ye returned safely, and you don’t need to worry anymore.”

Yun Shu chuckled and shook his head. “She is young, so I was a little worried. Now that she returned safely, my heart is naturally at ease.”

Yun Shu’s voice had a hint of laughter, and every word was filled with concern for Ye Qingtang, piercing Su Wan’s heart like a silver needle.

She secretly clenched her fists that were hidden in her sleeves and tried to maintain the sweet and gentle expression on her face.

“Senior Brother Yun has a good nature and everyone knows it. However, Junior Sister Ye went on the mission together with other senior brothers. Junior Sister Ye was born pretty, and those senior brothers would naturally take more care of her. You worry too much already.”

Su Wan’s neither harsh nor light words had needles hidden in them. Not only did she pick up the fact that Ye Qingtang did not go on the mission with Yun Shu, she even emphasized her beautiful appearance and close interactions with “other senior brothers.”

After Yun Shu heard her, he only gave a brief smile and did not put it to heart.

“It’s good that she’s back. If you meet her when you return, do tell her to find me. The warden taught quite a lot of things over the past few days, and I have prepared a set for her.”

Jealousy and hatred flashed across Su Wan’s eyes.

Ye Qingtang was not in the outer sect for the past half month, but Yun Shu actually thought about Ye Qingtang for everything!

On what basis!

Even though she was clearly the one staying by Senior Brother Yun’s side during this period of time!

“I got it. I will tell Junior Sister Ye when I return,” Su Wan said as she forcefully suppressed the unwillingness in her heart.

Yun Shu nodded and did not say anything more.

On the other side, Ye Qingtang reached the Rewards Pavilion in no time and went up the stairs directly.

There were not many people in the Rewards Pavilion at that time. When Ye Qingtang was handing in the head, she coincidentally met Gu Yanqiu and Qin Huan, who were submitting the mission as well.

“Junior Sister Ye, you’re finally willing to leave that precious silver wolf of yours now?” Qin Huan could not help but joke with Ye Qingtang when he saw her.

Over the past few days, they witnessed how overprotective she was.

Ye Qingtang raised her eyebrows and simply did not bother arguing with the likes of him.

Gu Yanqiu, who was standing aside, let out a laugh. At the same time, the warden in charge of verifying the mission entered the reward for killing the level 6 Giant Lizard into Gu Yanqiu’s bracelet.

In Xuanling Sect, every disciple had a bracelet which recorded the number of Xuanming points they had.

Gu Yanqiu looked at the Xuanming points on her bracelet and smiled at Ye Qingtang, “It’s good that you’re here Junior Sister Ye, you can take your share of Xuanming points.”

Ye Qingtang directly raised her hand with the bracelet without saying anything.

Gu Yanqiu immediately transferred Ye Qingtang’s sixty plus Xuanming points onto her bracelet.

“This is still a small amount. The head in your hand is then the big one,” Gu Yanqiu chuckled as he looked at Ye Qingtang. If other new disciples obtained sixty plus Xuanming points in their first month, it was already considered a huge amount. But this sixty over points were really nothing compared to Wu Qi’s head in Ye Qingtang’s hand.
