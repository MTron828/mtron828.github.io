Chapter 1090 Obsession (2)

“This is bad…”

The hidden ancient clan members’ expression changed drastically.

Divine King Luo Xue turned into a demon and was burning his body’s vitality. His power in this period of time would be magnified greatly, and it was unimaginable!

“Run!” The elderly shouted alarmingly.

However, just as this elderly spoke, Demon Lord Luo Xue’s cold demon eye had already locked on to him, and the Regicide Sky Blade made a frightening roar.

Swoosh!

The Regicide Sky Blade in Demon Lord Luo Xue’s hand slashed down.

Before the stunned masses, the Regicide Sky Blade actually chopped the elderly into half.

The enormous black wings behind Demon Lord Luo Xue flapped. He pulled the long, white hair of the elderly and lifted his upper body as he hovered in midair.

Hiss…!

Regardless of the Falling Sky Valley masses or the ancient clan people, everyone was dumbstruck by this scene. How tremendous was this force!!

Roar!

Demon Lord Luo Xue, who had been completely demonized, let out a shrilling demonic roar, and the elderly’s upper body exploded into bloody fog immediately.

Boom, boom!!

Before waiting for Demon Lord Luo Xue to make another move, the Heavenly Tribulation above him seemed to be even more infuriated as a blood-colored streak of lightning emerged and struck towards Demon Lord Luo Xue.

Noticing the situation, Demon Lord Luo Xue howled in fury. He opened his mouth to spit an endless black flame that contained an unimaginable destructive force, making it seem as if he wanted to burn this entire world down.

As the blood-colored streak of lightning and black demonic flame crashed into each other, monstrous destructive energy exploded in the air.

Ye Qingtang looked up in the sky. The frightening force produced from the collision of the Heavenly Tribulation and Demon Lord Luo Xue shattered the Dimension Wall completely this time…

It was unpreventable and irrevocable.

In no time, the powerful figures from the outside world would officially invade in… Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Roar”!

At this instant, the remaining bolts of lightning struck Demon Lord Luo Xue’s body aggressively.

Demon Lord Luo Xue roared in agony as he used his tough body to block the attack of the Heavenly Tribulation.

“Old Valley Master… Why are you… doing this!”

Tears flowed from Perfected Xuanchen’s eyes like an unbroken stream as he looked at Demon Lord Luo Xue, who was no longer human.

Perfected Xuanchen was not foolish and had already understood what happened to the old Valley Master from the conversation before.

In order to save his daughter, Perfected Xuanchen once headed to the area between the clouds and mountains to search for the hidden ancient clan, which was documented in the historical records, and he wanted to find divine elixirs that could save his daughter’s life.

However, Perfected Xuanchen never found any traces of the ancient clan and originally thought that the ancient clan did not even exist. Yet, today, they actually appeared in Falling Sky Valley, and what Perfected Xuanchen never expected was that there seemed to be a deep-seated hatred between the hidden ancient clan and the old Valley Master.

“Old Valley Master…”

The disciples of the twelve peaks were brimming with tears as they looked at the completely-demonized old Valley Master in the air.

How many young men and women in this world were deeply in love but unable to fulfill their passion and could only end their story on a heartbroken note?

“Quickly flee! Divine King Luo Xue is burning his vitality. His thinking and body are completely demonized already. He is unable to live for long. We just need to wait for him to die!”

One hidden ancient clan member shouted hurriedly.

At this instant, several hidden ancient clan elderlies fled towards the gold carriages.
