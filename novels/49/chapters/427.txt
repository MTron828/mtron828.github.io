The belittling expression in the Qinglin Sect elder’s eyes was increasingly obvious as they looked at the Xuanling Sect elders. He was certain that Xuanling Sect did not have anyone to send up anymore. Now that Zhu Changge sustained serious injuries, they probably would not even have the chance to contend for the second position with Wind Moon Sect.

“Why? Is there no one else from Xuanling Sect or Wind Moon Sect? Then this year… the champion of the Three Sect Competition would belong to our Qinglin Sect,” the Qinglin Sect elder said smugly with sarcasm behind his words.

The elders of both Wind Moon Sect and Xuanling Sect had rather ugly expressions.

A young boy with delicate features standing beside a Wind Moon Sect elder frowned tightly. He instinctively tugged on the Wind Moon Sect elder’s sleeves and said, “Master, I am willing to go up for a match!”

That young boy who requested a challenge was Shen Qingyu, who was known as a child prodigy.

The Wind Moon Sect elder looked at Shen Qingyu’s determined expression. He hesitated for a long while but still shook his head ultimately.

“You are still young and don’t have enough experience. This Fu Lingtian’s attacks are very fierce and violent. Before any training, you must not battle with him.”

Shen Qingyu’s talent was definitely above that of Fu Lingtian’s, but he was too young, and he had only cultivated for a short time, which was still not enough to have a match with the merciless Fu Lingtian. Moreover, the Wind Moon Sect elder just witnessed Zhu Changge from Xuanling Sect being severely injured, and it was apparent how ruthless Fu Lingtian was. If Shen Qingyu really went up, he would probably suffer a vicious blow.

“Elder Qian’s disciple is indeed amazing. Wind Moon Sect admits defeat,” the Wind Moon Sect elder took a deep breath and declared. Even if they lost the first place position, Feng Yiran still had the opportunity to fight for the second position, and there was no need to send Shen Qingyu up to risk right now.

After that announcement from his Master, there was no chance for Shen Qingyu to enter the ring even if he wanted to, and he could only clench his fists in reluctance.

Conceit filled the Qinglin Sect elder’s eyes after Wind Moon Sect made their stance known. Subsequently, the Qinglin Sect elder looked at Xuanling Sect, who was still struggling in difficulty.

Xuanling Sect had been defeated for many years, and if they lost again this year, they most likely would not have any face to participate in the Three Sect Competition in the following years. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Elder Mo, is there anyone else from Xuanling Sect that is going up?” asked the Qinglin Sect elder arrogantly. He was sure that Xuanling Sect did not have any more disciples who could have a match with Fu Lingtian.

Elder Mo’s expression darkened. No matter how good his temper was, he was inflamed from the Qinglin Sect elder’s cynical remarks.

The Xuanling Sect disciples were extremely displeased, but none of them dared to accept the challenge when Qinglin Sect asked.

They could not even win against Zhu Changge, much less Fu Lingtian.

As Elder Mo was about to finally admit defeat after remaining silent for a long while, a figure suddenly walked out from the crowd. She stood in front of Elder Mo and bowed.

“I am willing to enter the ring for a match with Fu Lingtian.”

The moment the voice sounded, everyone’s eyes looked in the direction of the voice.

Elder Mo looked in astonishment at the person in front of him who volunteered.

“Ye Qingtang?” Never would Elder Mo expect that the person who stood out at this instant would actually be Ye Qingtang?!

Surprise flashed across Elder Lin’s eyes when he saw Ye Qingtang. When Ye Qingtang’s name appeared in the list of names for the reserve disciples initially, he was skeptical but did not say anything.

Yet, Ye Qingtang wanted to enter the ring right now?

This was truly beyond Elder Lin’s expectations.
