After receiving the Regeneration Stone, Ye Qingtang spoke again without waiting for Ji Yixuan to speak. “And your Demon Subduing Pagoda.”

Then, Ye Qingtang tossed the Demon Subduing Pagoda that she found on Yue Tiancheng’s body to Ji Yixuan.

Looking at the Regeneration Stone and Demon Subduing Pagoda that he regained, Ji Yixuan was a little dumbfounded in a moment.

Not only did he survive from an ultimate-death situation, but even the Demon Subduing Pagoda and Regeneration Stone were back in his hands?!

“Who exactly are you?” Ji Yixuan looked up suddenly and at the alluring teen girl before him in surprise. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Regardless of whether it was the Regeneration Stone or Demon Subduing Pagoda, both were mystic treasures. Even if this girl was not a Yunxiao Sect disciple, these two items were an extremely huge temptation to anyone, but this girl actually returned them to him just like that?

“Who I am is not important. What is important is that you are not dead and did not lose the Regeneration Stone and the Demon Subduing Pagoda.”

Afterward, Ye Qingtang turned around and left.

“I am Ji Yixuan of Falling Sky Valley. May I ask for your name, please? I will definitely return your great kindness today!” Ji Yixuan said hurriedly as he watched Ye Qingtang leave.

“Ye Qingtang.”

“Ye Qingtang…” Ji Yixuan mumbled as though he had never heard of this name before.

“Thank you, Lady Ye,” Ji Yixuan said to the distance without knowing whether Ye Qingtang could hear.

On the other hand, Ye Qingtang had already walked far away at that moment.

Yunxiao Sect lost two disciples, and one of them was even the Sect Master’s disciple. Not long later, Yunxiao Sect would probably organize a search.

Because of the influence of her Ultimate Origin Skill, the force of the primordial qi in her body had turned gold and was exceptionally striking.

To prevent complications, Ye Qingtang chose to return to the sect by feet instead of continuing to use the Feather Formation Technique.

With Ye Qingtang’s speed, she would take about at least a few days to walk back to Xuanling Sect.

Throughout the journey, Ye Qingtang passed by a city and used her remaining gold to purchase a horse as a mean of transportation.

Two days later, Ye Qingtang passed by a mausoleum on her journey back.

An elderly was guarding outside the mausoleum.

His hair was gray, and he seemed to be old from his appearance.

However, once the horse crossed paths with the elderly who was blocking their way, its body stiffened and did not move no matter how Ye Qingtang whipped it as though it became a statue.

“That’s strange…” Ye Qingtang looked at the horse below her and frowned.

“Little girl. This road is not open. You should take another route.” The elderly, with seemingly cloudy eyes, radiated an unknowing glow as he smiled at Ye Qingtang.

“Take another route?” Ye Qingtang was surprised.

This mausoleum was a shortcut to Xuanling Sect, and she would take at least one more day if she changed her route.

“Mhm. I have sealed this area. It is wiser for you to continue your journey with another route,” said the elderly with a laugh.

“You have sealed it?” Ye Qingtang looked at the elderly. “What big talk. This area has been deserted for hundreds of years, and there’s no owner. Is it sealed just because you said it?”

There was a feasible shortcut right there, but she was asked to take another route. How would Ye Qingtang agree to this?

Nonetheless, the elderly was not bothered by her words and remained smiling. “I sealed this area in order to save the lives of you ignorant people. Just listen to what this old man says. Take another route and leave quickly.”

Before Ye Qingtang said anything else, a terrifying imposing aura spread out from the inside of the mausoleum.

In almost the blink of an eye, this frightening aura enshrouded the surroundings.
