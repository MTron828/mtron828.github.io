Chapter 1680: Amazing (3)

After hearing everything, Jiang Yiran’s concern was transformed into shock. He looked at Ye Qingtang in bewilderment.

It was as if he was seeing Ye Qingtang for the first time.

“Why didn’t you say earlier that you could beat her...” When Jiang Yiran finally recovered his wits, his first impulse was to burst into tears.

If he had known that Mu Ruxue was no match for Ye Qingtang, why would he allow Mu Ruxue to beat him up?

“Would you have believed me even if I told you?” Ye Qingtang looked at Jiang Yiran.

Jiang Yiran opened his mouth.

Before he closed it again...

No, he absolutely would not have believed her.

“...” For a moment, Jiang Yiran was utterly despondent. Not only would he not have believed her, even Jiang Yisheng and the others would not have believed her.

They had always thought that Ye Qingtang’s abilities were average at best. Even if Ye Qingtang had argued her case eloquently, they would not have believed that she really had that kind of ability.

“I didn’t expect you to...” Ye Qingtang looked at Jiang Yiran. What he had done had taken Ye Qingtang by surprise. Although this fellow had a sharp tongue, he really took responsibility for his own actions.

“Are you saying I’m stupid?” At that moment, Jiang Yiran felt like crying.

“...” Ye Qingtang was speechless.

“Alright, you’d better rest. Qingtang has already avenged you. I think Mu Ruxue is even worse off than you,” Jiang Yisheng said.

When Jiang Yiran heard that, he immediately cheered up.

“I can’t stand that lunatic. Good riddance since you’ve beaten her to death.”

Ye Qingtang stopped worrying when she saw that Jiang Yiran still had the energy to joke.

“But Qingtang, for the next round, you have to challenge those monsters who were in the top ten of the last Martial Arts Championship. You have to be careful. Even though you’ve beaten Mu Ruxue, that Baili Xuanyun and Mu Feiruo are all close to her so you must avoid challenging them. They’ll definitely be difficult to deal with.” Jiang Yiran started worrying again. He really wished he had curbed his sharp tongue.

“My goddess won’t be so petty...” Jiang Yisheng muttered.

“That’s her younger sister.” Jiang Yiran glared at Jiang Yisheng.

“It’s not just Mu Feiruo. Baili Xi, who is in first place, is also from the Baili Family. If Baili Xuanyun has a word with him, then...” The more Jiang Yiran thought about it, the more worried he grew.

Baili Xi was famous for his near demonic powers. Even now he was undefeated.

“Stop worrying. The contestants can choose who they want to challenge from the previous top ten. Not all the previous top ten are present this year, so they probably haven’t figured out how to adapt the rules yet,” Jiang Yisheng reasoned.

Jiang Yiran thought about it and agreed, so he did not say anything more. He simply collapsed on his bed, moaning in pain, until Jiang Yisheng felt like punching him. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Meanwhile, Baili Xuanyun hurried to Mu Ruxue’s rooms before the day’s matches were over.

When Ye Qingtang was fighting Mu Ruxue, she had used the simplest, crudest moves. Not only had she beaten Mu Ruxue until she was unrecognizable, the latter had also sustained many internal injuries. The physician from the Mu Family was treating Mu Ruxue when Baili Xuanyun arrived, but Mu Ruxue hid behind a veil, unwilling to let anyone see her ugliness.

“Younger Sister Ruxue, how are you?” Baili Xuanyun asked, his voice filled with concern.

“I want to kill her! I’ll kill her!” Mu Ruxue’s hoarse cries emerged from behind the veil.

Baili Xuanyun frowned slightly. He had not expected Ye Qingtang to be even more powerful than Mu Ruxue.
