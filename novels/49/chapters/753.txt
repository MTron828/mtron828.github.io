Li Jingwen opened his eyes wide in disbelief. He channeled all his Flying Dragon Inner Qi into his fist. and it was held easily by Ye Qingtang.

No matter how much strength he put in, his fist could not get closer anymore.

“Li Jingwen, that’s all you have?” Ye Qingtang lifted her brows slightly. She smiled as she stared at Li Jingwen, whose face was pale.

Ye Qingtang’s hand that was grabbing Li Jingwen’s fist suddenly rotated, and she snatched his wrist to pull him towards herself.

Li Jingwen was pulled over. His strength was totally incomparable to Ye Qingtang’s.

The moment half of Li Jingwen’s body was pulled over, Ye Qingtang raised the other hand and smashed onto his face.

Li Jingwen flew out under the force of the punch. The originally handsome face was totally ruined under Ye Qingtang’s punch. His skin was torn and bones broken. A few teeth that were stained with blood and a pool of blood spurted out from his mouth.

Li Jingwen collapsed on the ground. His eyes were rolled up, and blood filled his mouth. He appeared to be extremely confounded with a few missing teeth.

“You’re really… too weak.” Ye Qingtang’s head tilted as she looked at Li Jingwen, who collapsed on the ground and was unable to get up. Her sight then landed on the other Blue Cloud Peak disciples who were shocked.

The previously arrogant Blue Cloud Peak disciples were scared by Ye Qingtang’s one glance and stepped back. Their faces were all pale.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang was like a monster in their eyes. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The strongest disciple in Blue Cloud Peak was beaten by Ye Qingtang. How would they dare to be arrogant anymore?

“Who else needs my apology?” Ye Qingtang raised a brow.

No one of the Blue Cloud Peak dared to make any sound as they were scared that they would face the same consequences as Li Jingwen.

Furthermore, their abilities were lower than Li Jingwen. They were much weaker than him!

“Listen up! If anyone who’s still not satisfied, come and find me. If I know anyone that still bullies my Senior and Junior Brothers of the Admirable Sky Peak, no matter what’s the excuse, I’ll beat you to death,” Ye Qingtang said coldly.

The Blue Cloud Peak disciples were all frightened. No one dared to say anything.

Ye Qingtang’s intention was reached, and she was not willing to stay at the Blue Cloud Peak anymore. She turned and said towards Yan Shu who was still in shock, “Senior Brother Yan, things are settled here. Let’s head back.”

She turned and left after finishing her words.

Yan Shu was shocked for a while before he regained his consciousness. He turned to look at Li Jingwen instinctively and felt numb.

Yan Shu’s mind was complicated as he stared at Ye Qingtang’s back view.

Junior Brother Ye…

Was more terrifying than he imagined.

Yan Shu was slightly worried in his heart.

Junior Brother Ye was powerful, but how would this incident come to a close now that he beat Li Jingwen?

Yan Shu shook his head and dispersed all his thoughts. He then followed up.

After Ye Qingtang and Yan Shu left, the Blue Cloud Peak disciples then realized the situation and sent the unconscious Li Jingwen to the doctor.
