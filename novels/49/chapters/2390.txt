Chapter 2391: Replacement (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Vice-President, you…” Ye Qingtang knew that Wen Qi was going to send someone over. But… she never expected that someone to be Song Yanhan.

Zhu Ning had taught Song Yanhan his alchemy skills. If not for Yun Chen, he would definitely be the Netherworld Academy’s only hope. With someone of his caliber, Wu Fengling should have already assigned him to a team.

“One of Song Yanhan’s teammates is injured and has yet to recover. I am afraid he won’t be able to participate in the team competition…” Wen Qi sighed in frustration.

The teenager who performed the best amongst the Netherworld Academy students for the martial arts segment was in Song Yanhan’s team. He had given his best but ended up being severely injured, so there was no possibility that he could not continue competing.

With one person down, Song Yanhan’s team would not be able to qualify for the team competition. Under Zhu Ning’s suggestion, Wen Qi decided to send Song Yanhan over to Ye Qing’s team.

Of course, they could always replace that severely-injured teenager with Qiu Nan, but Qiu Nan had already been transferred to his teacher’s team. There were also other teams with members too injured to continue.

After shuffling around the fragmented teams, Song Yanhan emerged alone.

Wen Qi had his reasons for this arrangement.

The other teams already had their own alchemists, most of whom had rather low martial art levels. Ye Qing’s Yun Chen was… the only exception.

“Is he willing?” Ye Qingtang looked at Song Yanhan.

In reality, she did not really care who was sent over to their team. Her nine brats were enough. As long as the replacement would not be a burden, she had no objections.

Wen Qi knew of Ye Qing’s concerns, as well as the conflict between Song Yanhan, Lei Yan and the others, so he glanced at Song Yanhan.

Sighing in resignation, Song Yanhan stepped forward. “Teacher Ye, I was foolish and ignorant in the past. Please forgive me, I will give my best for this team competition.”

Song Yanhan felt very aggrieved. He used to hold such a high status in the Netherworld Academy in the past, but now he had ended up with this team, and he even had to beg to join them. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

But this person he was begging, he couldn’t deny the latter’s skills.

Not only were Ye Qing’s elixir-refinement skills higher than his Master Zhu Ning’s, but even his student’s abilities were also better than his own.

What else could Song Yanhan say…

“Alright.” Ye Qingtang saw that Song Yanhan was sincere about joining, and so she didn’t try to make things difficult for him.

After everything was confirmed, Wen Qi led Ye Qing to one side for a private conversation. Meanwhile, Song Yanhan was left standing before that bunch of brats.

Song Yanhan, “…”

Lei Yan rubbed his chin and circled around Song Yanhan. The expression on Lei Yan’s face gave Song Yanhan goosebumps.

“Brother.” Lei Yan smacked Song Yanhan’s shoulder.

Song Yanhan was startled.

Damn, he wouldn’t be able to hold his own against this guy in a fight. Was this fellow going to take this opportunity to take revenge now?

“We are a family from now on, so don’t worry. We will take care of you during the team competition. But… you need to control your teacher in the future. Please stop him from dragging our Boss away all the time,” Lei Yan spoke meaningfully.

Song Yanhan, “…”

How could this bunch of kids still be so relaxed?

Didn’t they know the trouble the Netherworld Academy was in?

Song Yanhan was different from Lei Yan and the others. He knew the dire straits the Netherworld Academy would be in if they failed to get three spirit jades in this competition.

Currently, they only had in their possession the two spirit jades won by Yun Chen and him. The only competition that remained was the team competition…
