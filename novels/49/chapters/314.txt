Chapter 315: Inner Sect Assessment (4)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Looking at Yuan Wei who was standing beside the ring, Elder Huang could not hide his smile.

“Congratulations, Elder Huang. You really have a good eye. This Yuan Wei defeated the disciple ranked fourth on the ranking chart yesterday. He really cannot be belittled. In my opinion, there is a high chance for him to challenge the top three places with his abilities,” praised another elder from the outer sect.

“It’s nothing. It is Yuan Wei himself who has the talent. I just nominated him conveniently.” Elder Huang replied humbly though he was deeply pleased.

Apart from Yuan Wei’s outstanding performance, the other person who was responsible for Elder Huang’s good mood was Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang never entered the ring in the past few days, and he had not seen her today as well, which finally put his mind at east. He reckoned that after days of competition, Ye Qingtang should have seen the disciples’ skills, especially in yesterday’s competition where the sparring was even more aggressive with the appearance of the top ten disciples on the ranking chart. It seemed…

Ye Qingtang should have understood the situation clearly and probably would not insist on entering the ring today.

It was a pity though. Those thirty thousand Xuanming points were not used for anything and just had to be wasted like that.

At that thought, Elder Huang could not help but sigh.

Other than the dark horse, Yuan Wei, there was no change in the ranking chart for the top ten disciples. Ji Xianyuan was still ranked first, and Lin Feng was also ranked third. Rather, Dai Changming who originally ranked tenth was pushed back to the eleventh rank because of Yuan Wei’s addition. Luckily, he cultivated diligently during this period of time and defeated the disciple ranked right before him and climbed back to the tenth place once again.

After days of battle, the disciples had more or less some knowledge about the skills of the top ten people on the ranking chart and as such, recognized the gap between themselves and the top ten disciples.

In the observation tower, the four inner sect elders who observed three days of competition were gathered together as they waited for the final day of competition.

“I don’t blame Elder Huang for breaking the rules. This Yuan Wei is really promising with great potential. Elder Huang really has a good eye.” Elder Lin praised rarely.

“What do you think, Elder Lin? Yuan Wei isn’t the top three, but he is extremely talented. If you favor him, you can accept him as a disciple and make an exception to accept him into the inner sect,” said the Fist Faction Elder.

Elder Lin did not say anything but seemed to be deep in thought.

As the elders talked, the competition on the last day officially began. The top three disciples who would ultimately enter the inner sect would be decided today.

The warden in charge of the competition stood in the center of the ring to declare the start of the competition. Many outer sect disciples were gathered in the square to watch the blood-filled battles amongst the top disciples.

Yuan Wei stood below the ring and glanced across the sight before him.

Suddenly, Yuan Wei took a step into the arena.

His appearance resulted in a flurry of gasps.

It should be known that Yuan Wei was currently placed fourth in the ranking chart. Now that he entered the ring once again, there was only one possibility…

He wanted to challenge the holder of the top three positions!

“Disciple, Yuan Wei, wishes to challenge the third place, Senior Brother Lin Feng.” Yuan Wei’s face had an arrogance of the youth.

Loud cheers erupted immediately.

Standing below the ring, Lin Feng’s lips curled into a smile, which added a tinge of haughtiness on his originally good-looking face.
