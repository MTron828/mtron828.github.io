1498 Big Demon 4

Jiang Shangyu was stunned by these words.

“What did you say? The Holy Lord of Shadows is back?” Jiang Shangyu’s eyes were filled with surprise. The Holy Lord of Shadows had vanished for many years. Many forces in Central Mainland assumed that the Holy Lord of Shadows had died quietly...

“It’s absolutely true. An elder from my clan saw the Holy Lord of Shadows in the Eternal Dynasty. Now, the forces from the Temple of Shadows are here, together with all eight tribe leaders. The Holy Lord of Shadows might be in the Black Bone Carriage,” the elder from the Ancient You Clan said.

They had tried to make trouble for Ling Yan in the Eternal Dynasty, but the Holy Lord of Shadows had unexpectedly intervened, preventing them from attaining their goal. From this incident, they had learned that the Holy Lord of Shadows had returned.

Jiang Shangyu’s expression grew grave. Jiang Shangyu had not received news of the Holy Lord of Shadows’ return, but at this moment, the Ancient You Clan certainly would not be speaking carelessly.

Jiang Shangyu’s gaze turned once more to the Black Bone Carriage in the void.

Could the Holy Lord of Shadows really be sitting in the Black Bone Carriage?

Although the Holy Lord of Shadows had vanished for a long time, she was still the most important person in Central Mainland. Legends had it that she had fought with one of the big demons in Central Mainland, and although they had reached an impasse, her presence today meant they might have a greater chance of winning.

Jiang Shangyu and the elder from the Ancient You Clan quietly discussed whether to negotiate an alliance with the Temple of Shadows. While they were talking, Ye Qingtang, who was standing in the corner, heard every word.

The Holy Lord of Shadows?

Now, Ye Qingtang did not know whether to laugh or to cry.

If circumstances had not forbidden it, she would tell the Ancient You Clan and Jiang Shangyu to forget about it.

The “Holy Lord of Shadows” that the Ancient You Clan had encountered was right here!

Where would they go to find another?

Although those were her thoughts, Ye Qingtang took a handkerchief and swiftly covered her face.

Besides other considerations, many of her “acquaintances” were currently present. Whether it was the Temple of Shadows or the green-robed girl, her face would be “fresh in their memories”

Perhaps they had not noticed her when they were fleeing just now, but if they saw her face now, things would get interesting.

The green-robed girl and the eight tribe leaders would kill her without the big demon needing to act.

Ye Qingtang had not forgotten that the eight tribe leaders were still strongly suspicious of her identity as the Holy Lord of Shadows.

A moment later, Jiang Shangyu and the elder from the Ancient You Clan seemed to come to a decision. As the big demon’s sonic waves dissipated, the two seized the opportunity to fly upwards and headed straight for the group from the Temple of Shadows.

Ye Qingtang did not know what Jiang Shangyu and the Temple of Shadows said, but they seemed to come to some sort of agreement.

Everyone was forming alliances, but the big demon was getting closer. In a moment, the area that the big demon’s feet passed over was a gory mess. The strong scent of blood filled the air, accompanied by the big demon’s roars. It looked like hell on earth.

The various forces that had been fighting each other earlier now cooperated to fight for a chance to survive.

The troops from every side used their killing moves. Even the demon kings exerted themselves fully.

To the big demon, their combined efforts were pathetic.

More and more people fell, and the big demon’s tongue drew countless small demons into its mouth.
