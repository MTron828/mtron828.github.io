Chapter 805 Consequence of Your Own Sin (3)

Puff!

A deep sound suddenly rang.

A sharp sword pierced through the Emperor Dowager’s chest.

Ye Qingtang stared at the Emperor Dowager who was killed by her sword and pulled out her sword.

The force on the little Emperor’s neck disappeared. He coughed violently and opened his eyes wide. The Emperor Dowager fell backward instantly, and the blood flew onto his body.

“Mother…” The little Emperor crawled towards the Emperor Dowager immediately. Large drops of tears fell onto the Emperor Dowager’s body.

He stretched out his hand and covered the wound on the Emperor Dowager’s chest. Warm blood spilled over his hand.

“Don’t die… mother… please… please don’t die…”

The Emperor Dowager’s face was nearly expressionless. Blood stained her cheeks. She trembled and lifted her hand to reach for the little Emperor’s neck…

However, she did not have the strength to seize his neck anymore.

The Emperor Dowager finished her last breath. Her twisted craziness and greed disappeared along with her life.

Perhaps, she once loved the Grand Emperor and the little Emperor.

However, her love could not beat her ambition and her hatred.

Eventually…

All of them ruined her entire life.

Greed could only kill one’s conscience.

“Mother!!” The little Emperor shouted and cried as he lied on the Emperor Dowager’s body.

He could not understand. He always listened to his mother’s orders and Qin Long’s command to be a fatuous emperor…

But why eventually… Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

He still lost his mother.

The Grand Emperor stared at the Emperor Dowager’s corpse and closed his eyes slowly.

Whether it was hatred or guilt, nothing would matter anymore.

Blood spread out in the room slowly.

Ye Qingtang put back her Demonic Blood Sword and stared at everything happening in front of her eyes.

Suddenly, she seemed to realize something. She bent down and took the Emperor Dowager’s space ring and opened it.

A batch of letters was taken out.

The words “Formidable Heavens Royals” were written on the letter.

“What… what is this?” The Grand Emperor looked through the letter in shock. The content really surprised him.

The letter was filled with the secret information of the Nine Nights Dynasty that the Emperor Dowager wanted to reveal to the Formidable Heavens Royals.

The arrangement of the armies at the borders and the secret paths in the palace were all written clearly inside.

Ye Qingtang understood what was going on after taking a glimpse at the letter.

She found the Emperor Dowager’s words peculiar just now.

Why could she be so sure that the entire Nine Nights Dynasty would die along with her?

Ye Qingtang remembered the war between the Formidable Heavens Dynasty and the Nine Nights Dynasty in her previous life.

Though the Nine Nights Dynasty lost miserably, the Formidable Heavens Dynasty’s victory was too easy.

Thus…

She was suspecting whether the Emperor Dowager did something.

“I did not expect that… she would be so vicious. She wanted to destroy the entire Nine Nights Dynasty…” The Grand Emperor sighed.

If the information was leaked, the Nine Nights Dynasty would definitely lose when the war began.

It was lucky that the key information about the Nine Nights Dynasty was not leaked to the Formidable Heavens Dynasty. The information seemed to be the final leverage in the Emperor Dowager’s hands.

If Ye Qingtang did not discover the Emperor Dowager’s ambition today, according to the progress in her previous life, the secrets would be passed to the Formidable Heavens Dynasty in a few years’ time.

The Formidable Heavens Dynasty would then attack the Nine Nights Dynasty after knowing all the secrets!
