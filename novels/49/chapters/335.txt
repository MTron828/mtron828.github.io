“I didn’t expect to meet you so soon after the day at the Lingxi River. I’m rather… surprised,” Song Junqiu said, and his eyes scanned through the room.

Song Junqiu just received the news of the few outer sect disciples who entered the inner sect. and Ye Qingtang was one of them. He thought that he would not see her in the inner sect for the next few years, but surprisingly, she entered the inner sect in a few months. This reminded him of the incident at the Lingxi River.

The rest of the inner sect disciples who came along with Song Junqiu were expressionless, but their eyes showed little sarcasm.

“Senior Brother Song,” Ye Qingtang said softly.

“Junior Sister Ye, you just entered the inner sect, and I think you are not very familiar with the rules in the inner sect. I think I have the responsibility to remind you of something, since we have met before,” Song Junqiu said as his sight landed on the box that contained the Soul Condensation Pills.

Fei Ying and Ni Shang could sense the intentions of Song Junqiu. Both of them were still young, and Song Junqiu was an inner sect disciple. They stood closely beside Ye Qingtang, and their eyes were full of anxiety.

Song Junqiu sat down beside the table casually and looked towards Fei Ying and Ni Shang.

“Junior Sister Ye, where are the manners of the two servants beside you? They don’t even know how to serve tea to the guests here?”

Ni Shang trembled and apologized immediately. “I’ll prepare the tea for Young Sir now.”

Ni Shang then was about to get the tea.

Song Junqiu suddenly exchanged glances with the rest of the disciples. The disciples blocked Ni Shang’s way then.

Ni Shang’s face turned pale, as she had never experienced such a situation due to her young age.

Fei Ying went forward and pulled Ni Shang to his back as he saw Ni Shang’s unpleasant face. He stared at the disciples watchfully.

Song Junqiu’s sight was cold.

The identities of the sword boy and the servant were higher than those of the outer sect disciples, but they were still inferior compared to the inner sect disciples.

“How dare you to stare at inner sect disciples as a sword boy and a servant?” Song Junqiu shouted.

Fei Ying and Ni Shang were stunned.

Ye Qingtang squinted her eyes and pulled the two shocked children to her back.

“They are still young, and they just entered the inner sect not long ago. Please forgive them if they do not behave well now, Senior Brother Song.” Ye Qingtang explained. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Song Junqiu chuckled. “Junior Sister Ye, I will not blame you if they do not know the manners, since you just entered the inner sect as well. However, someone needs to teach them. You are very kind, but you should not spoil them with your kindness. They are servants, and they should be punished when they do not respect us. Junior Sister Ye, I’m doing this for your own good.”

Song Junqiu threw another glance to the disciples, and they immediately pulled Fei Ying and Ni Shang over.

Ye Qingtang’s face changed. The sect did not allow any fights between the disciples, so Song Junqiu would not do anything to her in the sect. Thus, he found an excuse to punish Fei Ying and Ni Shang to warn her.

Song Junqiu still resented her for the incident at the Lingxi River.
