1400 The Eight Tribe Leaders 2

“Nothing special. It was just that some details were different from what we remember. Furthermore, the Holy Lord’s return is too sudden, and I keep feeling that there’s something off.” The Goblin Tribe Leader was a sharp person, and he had been suspicious since his first meeting with Ye Qingtang.

“However, what Ming Wang said is logical as well. That Illusory Void…” Another tribe leader said thoughtfully. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The Nether Fire Tribe Leader waved a hand, however.

“It is not impossible to enter the Illusory Void. The Holy Lord used her Immortal and Buddha Bloodline to seal that Illusory Void previously, and the reason why we are unable to enter it may very likely be because we do not have that bloodline. If that impostor possesses the Immortal and Buddha Bloodline, perhaps she can enter.”

The other tribe leaders agreed with what the Nether Fire Tribe Leader said.

After all, they were very doubtful of this Holy Lord who returned. Moreover, the explanation of the Immortal and Buddha Bloodline made sense, and no one could be certain of anything.

“Why did Ming Wang not think of this reason?” A tribe leader asked.

The Nether Fire Tribe Leader chuckled. “Those who are closely involved often cannot see the situation clearly. Ming Wang values the Holy Lord much more than everyone else. Although he is cautious, it may be unavoidable that he will be swayed by emotions.”

“What should we do then?”

Ming Wang could not be relied on now as he seemed to believe Ye Qingtang fully.

While they were not fully certain that the current Holy Lord was an impostor.

If there was a fifty percent chance that she was the real Holy Lord of Shadows, the consequences would be dire if they offended her directly.

They were all aware of how powerful the Holy Lord of Shadows who dominated the entire mainland back then was.

The Nether Fire Tribe Leader did not speak any further. Since they had come to the Temple of Shadows, it was logical for them to greet the Holy Lord. In addition, they had an important matter to report to the Holy Lord.

However…

Before that, they still needed to make a further judgment.

Once all the tribe leaders left the underground palace, the Nether Fire Tribe Leader slowed his footsteps intentionally, and a Nether Fire Tribe guard who had been waiting outside walked over on his tribe leader’s signal.

“When you meet the Holy Lord later…” The Nether Fire Tribe Leader whispered to the guard, and the guard nodded.

This subtle action did not escape the eyes of the other tribe leaders, but they understood the situation the moment they saw the guard beside the Nether Fire Tribe Leader.

In the main palace of the Temple of Shadows, Ye Qingtang was seated in the black bone throne as she looked at the eight tribe leaders of the Undead Clan before her.

There were millions of species in the Undead Clan, and the number of species which followed the Holy Lord of Shadows was aplenty. However, apart from the Skeleton Tribe, there were eight tribes that were the most powerful; thus, the rulers of these tribes in the Central Mainland were collectively known as the ‘Eight Tribe Leaders’.

Ye Qingtang met the Goblin Tribe Leader and Demon Tribe Leader when she first came to the Temple of Shadows, and this was the first time that all eight tribe leaders were present.

She had heard about the ‘Eight Tribe Leaders’ in her previous life, and she could not help but discreetly scan them one by one now that she saw them.

The power and influence of the eight tribe leaders were just second to the Holy Lord of Shadows in the Undead Clan, and even Ming Wang and Ming Gu could not be compared to them. Each tribe leader led a large army of tribe members, and their ferociousness demanded respect.

When Ye Qingtang’s eyes passed over a body covered in black flames, her heart skipped a beat.

The Nether Fire Tribe…
