1363 Mission Completed 2

Ye Qingtang was quite delighted that she could use the nebula points to exchange for treasures.

However, the God of Nature gave her an unexpected number.

One point…

Ye Qingtang was slightly stunned when she saw the number of points, but she thought that it only required a few points to exchange for rewards in the Star Pavilion. That might be the reason why the reward was so little.

However, when she saw the price of one hundred thousand under the Soul Formation Elixir…

Ye Qingtang really wanted to kill the God of Nature if she could fight him.

The God of Nature even shamelessly announced the second mission.

The second mission was to acquire respect from everyone in this country.

Ye Qingtang wanted to kill herself when she heard the mission.

How come the missions came one after another?

Ye Qingtang used her power to suppress everyone in order to take over the control in the General’s residence. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

However, to let everyone in the country pay respect to her…

The God of Nature must be fooling her around.

“Qiao’er, don’t worry. I will be here with you the whole time.” General Qiao thought that Ye Qingtang was scared as he did not get any response from her.

Ye Qingtang cleared her mind and thought about General Qiao’s words. Before he started another round of persuasion, Ye Qingtang nodded.

Since she had to stay in this world for a while, she wanted to figure out how powerful the people here were…

The powerful figures beside the Emperor should be better than General Qiao at least.

Ye Qingtang wanted to give it a try.

Furthermore…

The second mission given by the God of Nature was also related to the country.

If the world here did not contain enough spirit energy for Ye Qingtang to cultivate, she would definitely say farewell to him based on the pathetic number of points.

General Qiao did not know what Ye Qingtang was thinking about. He led Ye Qingtang to apologize to the Emperor. Ye Qingtang left the little white tiger inside the room and did not bother with the God of Nature, who followed her behind.

No one could see him anyway.

The country where Ye Qingtang was located at in this world was called the Yuan Kingdom. It was supposedly the most powerful kingdom.

There was a legend in the Yuan Kingdom saying that the first emperor of the kingdom had witnessed an immortal beside an abyss. He then built the kingdom and believed strongly that he must receive luck from the immortal in order for him to rule the country.

Everyone in the country worshiped immortals based on that legend. Every emperor also longed for immortal elixirs in order to live beyond a hundred years old and become immortal.

There was another legend saying that one of the Emperors ate a half-completed elixir and lived one hundred and eleven years. He was the most long-lived man in the world.

The current Emperor felt an urgent need to get the immortal elixir based on his ancestor’s experience.

When General Qiao brought Ye Qingtang to the royal palace, Ye Qingtang saw the obese Emperor, who was in luxurious clothes, sitting in a tiny throne in rage.

A few higher-ups, as well as Su Mo’er and her husband, were waiting in the palace for quite a while.

They were very hostile when they saw Ye Qingtang walking into the palace.

“Your Majesty, I have brought my disloyal daughter Su Qiao here.” General Qiao took a step forward and paid respects to the Emperor.

Ye Qingtang stood straight in the palace and did not intend to pay respect to the obese Emperor at all.

The Emperor’s face was filled with a murderous expression, and he did not care about General Qiao’s bow at all.
