Using Ning Luo’s perception, they quickly searched the entire residence.

But Ning Luo didn’t sense anything familiar.

Ye Qingtang grabbed hold of a servant and demanded to know if there was a secret room. The servant had already been shaking when he saw her. Seeing that she had already made her way into the residence, how would he dare keep information from her? He quickly spilled all the information.

There was a prison hidden in a part of the residence and the servant had no idea who was being held there. Only the top members of the Ancient You Clan could enter the prison.

Releasing the servant, Ye Qingtang quickly headed over with Ning Luo.

It was pitch-black darkness in the prison and the stench of rotten flesh filled their nose the moment they entered. She froze as she walked further in and saw what was inside.

A few lamps lit up the dark space.

On the uneven walls were dried streaks of blood. In the corner of the prison lay a pile of rotting demon pelts. The stench was so nauseating it was unbearable.

The prison was empty save for the rotting pelts.

Ye Qingtang’s face was apprehensive as she gazed at the demon pelts. The pelts weren’t big and she could tell that they were from the demon cubs.

It was the same as the information You Qiong had given her. But seeing it with her own eyes was vastly different and she was hit with a sudden rush of feelings.

“She’s not here.” Ning Luo looked coldly at the cruel sight before him, his eyes impassive.

Ye Qingtang came to her senses and nodded slightly.

Just as Ning Luo was about to leave, sparks shot out of Ye Qingtang’s hands and she set the demon pelts on fire, along with the reminders of the atrocities and cruelty committed in the place.

The flames lit up her golden mask and flickered in her eyes, masking her real emotions.

Without saying a word, she turned to leave after the flames rose. She suddenly thought of the primordial humans who had betrayed the True God.

How far could humans go for their power and desires?

...

Back on the battlefield, it was clear that the Crimson League had an overwhelming advantage. Elder Cong looked at the fallen youths as his heart sank.

“Elder Cong, I don’t think we can hold out any longer...” A soldier rushed to Elder Cong pathetically with blood covering his face.

The youths of the Ancient You Clan could fight against the alien races, but the numbers that the Crimson League had simply far overwhelmed them.

“Retreat!” Seeing that they had no choice of winning, without any hesitation, Elder Cong quickly finished off the Ancient Clan elder he was fighting against and began escaping amongst the chaos of the battle.

With the departure of their youths, it was only a matter of time before the Ancient You Clan was defeated. The remaining forces were no match for the Crimson League at all and they were taken care of swiftly.

After the battle had calmed down, the Ancient Clans glanced at the countless corpses from the Ancient You Clan under their feet. Their eyes were unusually calm.
