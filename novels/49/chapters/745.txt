Weren’t they very arrogant and flaunting their prowess when they were behind Li Jingwen just now?

Yet they were acting pitiful now?!

“Eldest Senior Brother, for this matter…” Yin Qingluo wanted to say something to Gu Yihan when she saw how shameless Li Jingwen and the other Blue Cloud Peak disciples were.

However, Gu Yihan raised his hand and stopped Yin Qingluo from finishing her sentence.

“Junior Brother Li, Ye Chen is not in the valley today. When he returns, I will interrogate him myself. If you don’t have anything else today, you can head back first, Junior Brother Li,” Gu Yihan said coldly. As he finished speaking, his hand that hung beside him seemed to touch the sword handle at his waist casually.

Li Jingwen sharply noticed Gu Yihan’s action, and his eyes flickered.

If Gu Yihan really attacked, he was probably not Gu Yihan’s opponent.

Li Jingwen pondered for a moment and finally said, “Since that is what you want, I’ll give you face today. However, my junior brothers sustained rather heavy injuries. Ye Chen attacked first and has to give our Blue Cloud Peak an explanation no matter what. In addition, he has to compensate for the loss of my junior brothers.”

“I’ll relay the message,” Gu Yihan said in a deep tone.

Li Jingwen smiled as he reached his objective. Subsequently, he turned around and led those Blue Cloud Peak disciples away, not forgetting to leave a sentence before leaving.

“Senior Brother Gu, your Admirable Sky Peak disciples are merely like that… Haha.”

Yin Qingluo clenched her teeth tightly as she watched Li Jingwen and the rest leave.

“Eldest Senior Brother, why did you let them go just like that? They injured so many Admirable Sky Peak disciples. Do we let them off just like that?!” Yin Qingluo could no longer hold herself back.

Gu Yihan looked at the exasperated Yin Qingluo, who burst into a fury, but he did not say anything. Then, he looked at those injured Admirable Sky Peak disciples, and a constrained expression was increasingly evident in his eyes.

“Do you think this only involves the Blue Cloud Peak?” Gu Yihan asked.

Yin Qingluo was slightly stunned.

Yan Shu sighed helplessly and patted Yin Qingluo’s shoulder. “Junior Sister Yin, Eldest Senior Brother has his own reasons for doing this.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

He paused for a moment and continued,

“Blue Cloud Peak and Water Cut Peak have always been on friendly terms with Full Moon Peak, which is the most powerful peak in Falling Sky Valley. When Master became the acting Valley Master back then, it attracted the dissatisfaction of the Peak Masters of these three peaks. Full Moon Peak’s Peak Master has been trying to find a chance to launch an attack on Master, but as of now, it was to no avail.”

“Master did not want us to stir troubles because he did not want to ruin the harmony in Falling Sky Valley. If this matter is blown up, Water Cut Peak and Full Moon Peak would also participate in this, much less Blue Cloud Peak. By then, Falling Sky Valley would be chaotic. Eldest Senior Brother also had no choice but to do this…” Yan Shu’s tone was rather helpless. Taking the big picture into consideration, they, Admirable Sky Peak disciples, could only give in to others again and again.

Yin Qingluo pursed her lips. Although she understood the reason for this, this injustice stifled her.

“Do we have to keep conniving them just like that!” Yin Qingluo threw her sword on the ground furiously and left. Although she knew that this was a stop-gap measure, how could she swallow this grievance down!

Yan Shu felt extremely helpless as he watched Yin Qingluo leave. However, he adjusted his emotions very quickly and told Gu Yihan. “Eldest Senior Brother, you can do whatever you need to do first. I can settle the things here.”
