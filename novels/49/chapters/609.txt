There were plenty of birds and flowers in the valley. It was hard to believe that this place was the Hell of Avicinaraka. However, Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder were more cautious at the heaven-like place in the Hell of Avicinaraka.

The safer a place looked like in the Hell of Avicinaraka, the more dangerous it would be.

Thought both of their cultivation levels had reached the Martial Qi Level Three, that meant nothing in the Hell of Avicinaraka. They might lose their lives at any moment if they were not cautious.

The sounds of roars and fighting were getting closer as well.

After around fifteen minutes, Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder arrived at the center of the valley. There was a cave full of spirit energy about a few hundred meters away.

“The blessed Grotto-heaven?” Ye Qingtang was slightly stunned as she saw the cave. Joy flashed across her eyes.

The blessed Grotto-heaven was a place with a huge destiny. It was rare for it to appear in a mystic realm.

“Holy Lady, be careful of any tricks!” The Blood Moon Elder warned Ye Qingtang as she walked towards the blessed Grotto-heaven.

Ye Qingtang nodded and was fully prepared. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The mystic realm in the Hell of Avicinaraka was full of dangers, especially when the starting of the Hell of Avicinaraka seemed to be a conspiracy.

Ye Qingtang observed the blessed Grotto-heaven outside cautiously for a long time. She was slightly relieved when she confirmed that there was no danger at this place.

“We shall go inside and take a look,” Ye Qingtang said softly and walked inside.

The Blood Moon Elder followed Ye Qingtang closely and put up his guard.

Ye Qingtang frowned as she just entered the cave.

There were many bones of huge demonic beasts left in the blessed Grotto-heaven.

The fragmented bones were scattered around everywhere, and they created a gloomy feel in people.

“Is this a living place of a certain king-level demonic beast?” The Blood Moon Elder’s face was full of astonishment.

King-level demonic beasts usually stayed alone. Their abilities were way above those of normal demonic beasts. They had weird tracks and seldom appeared in front of humans. Even if one was lucky enough to meet one, only those who were extremely powerful were able to defeat the demonic beast. Most people died in their hands.

There were numerous demonic beasts with strong fighting abilities in the Hell of Avicinaraka. It was possible that there was a king-level demonic beast.

“It’s possible.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

Ye Qingtang sized up the blessed Grotto-heaven. It was a rare place with a large amount of spirit energy, so much that other places could not even be compared with it. Even the Drifting Cloud Island, which was the location for the three sect competition, was incomparable to the blessed Grotto-heaven here.

If she could utilize the spirit energy in the blessed Grotto-heaven for cultivation, the results would be better than if she did it any other places.

However, destinies always carried danger along.

Ye Qingtang hesitated for a while and made her decision swiftly.

“I need to absorb the spirit energy in this cave using the shortest possible time. You will guard the place for me. Stop me if anything happens,” Ye Qingtang said towards the Blood Moon Elder immediately.

She did not know when she would encounter such a destiny again. She was not willing to give up any chance to make herself stronger!

The Blood Moon Elder obviously understood how precious the blessed Grotto-heaven was. He nodded instantly and said, “Rest assured, Holy Lady.”

The Blood Moon Elder walked out of the cave and initiated protection skills to guard her.
