Chapter 568 Mystic Realm (2)

Currently, there were a few sect disciples guarding the entrance of the mystic realm.

Two of them had already entered the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three while the remaining disciples were inner sect disciples from Wind Moon Sect and Qinglin Sect.

“Holy Lady, we should enter already,” the Blood Moon Elder said.

After hearing him, Ye Qingtang smiled faintly. “There’s no hurry.”

The powerful figures of both Formidable Heavens Dynasty and Nine Nights Dynasty had just entered the mystic realm, and if Ye Qingtang entered right now, she would only meet them coincidentally, and it would be difficult to get away then.

This wait lasted two days.

The disciples from Yunxiao Sect, Qinglin Sect, and Wind Moon Sect were considerably loyal as they guarded at their posts at all times without slacking off.

Early dawn, Ye Qingtang shot the Blood Moon Elder a look and slowly walked out from the hidden corner with the Blood Moon Elder. They appeared before everyone and walked towards the entrance of the mystic realm.

At that moment, the sect disciples guarding at the area saw an extraordinarily handsome young sir with an extremely hideous-looking woman in a floral dress who had a big red flower on her head.

“Stop there!”

A young disciple from Wind Moon Sect immediately stepped forward and shouted. “Who’s there!”

A faint smile hung on Ye Qingtang’s lips as she said replied softly. “An itinerant cultivator.”

Afterward, she pointed to the Blood Moon Elder behind and said, “While this beautiful lady is my servant.”

“Be… Beautiful?!”

After hearing Ye Qingtang’s words, the disciples, including both Yunxiao Sect disciples, almost vomited.

This male had such an outstanding appearance, yet no one dared to compliment his aesthetic judgment.

Could his eyes be blind… The servant behind him

is frighteningly scary, yet he called her beautiful…

Looking at the reaction of those sect disciples, the Blood Moon Elder wanted to say something but was ultimately unable to utter a single word.

“This place is already sealed. Foreign people are not allowed to enter. Leave this place or you’ll be killed!” a Yunxiao Sect disciple said coldly with an imposing stance.

“Does this road belong to your family? Can a sect be so arrogant?” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“Then try taking a step forward.” The Yunxiao Sect disciple remained silent as he sized up Ye Qingtang and scoffed.

Then, Ye Qingtang exchanged a look with the Blood Moon Elder. Subsequently, with smiles on her face, her legs moved, and she indeed took a step forward. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

At that moment, the faces of all the sects’ disciples darkened.

This person’s action is clearly challenging a sect’s authority!

“You have a death wish!” A Yunxiao Sect disciple hollered furiously. He raised his right arm in the air and smashed a hand towards Ye Qingtang.

Immediately, the aura of a First Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three filled the air as a strong wind stirred up from the force of his smash.

Sensing the frightening aura of the Yunxiao Sect inner sect disciple, the expressions of the Wind Moon Sect and Qinglin Sect disciples changed, and horror filled their faces.

Martial Qi Level Three was already listed as a powerful figure in the martial dao, and they could easily crush anyone with just one finger.

The two sects’ disciples could not help but shake their heads. The moment that itinerant cultivator who did not belong to any sects or clans took that step forward and challenged the sect’s authority, he was already a dead man.

“You have a death wish.”

Seeing that the Yunxiao Sect disciple stroke, a cold glint flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

At the same time, a blood-colored sword shadow streaked across the sky with a “clank.”
