Chapter 1512 Big Fellow 3

Ye Qingtang sighed in relief after the big demon flew into the clouds.

“Ye Qingtang, you’re here.” Ye Qingtang suddenly heard someone shout her name.

Jiang Qin and the rest were looking for Ye Qingtang for a while. They came over when they heard the noise and were shocked by the big demon, but...

Their eyes brightened when they saw Ye Qingtang, who was covered with blood.

It was such a coincidence!

Ye Qingtang did not expect that she would encounter any danger when she just managed to escape from the previous one. Her eyes darkened when she saw Jiang Qin and the few disciples of the Jiang Family behind her. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Ye Qingtang, you have lived long enough. Today will be the day of your death.” Jiang Qin sneered.

“Don’t bother looking for Jiang Xun anymore. He’s dragged by my elder brother now. Prepare for your death now!”

“You’re so kind to Ye You.” Ye Qingtang chuckled. She had nothing to do with Jiang Qin, but everything was due to Ye You.

“You’re not even comparable to You Er. If you behaved yourself, I could still spare your life. But you didn’t know your place here and kept disturbing You Er’s life. I will not allow that to happen anymore.” Jiang Qin narrowed her eyes and took a glimpse at the Jiang Family disciples behind her.

“Only when you’re dead will You Er be relieved.

The moment Jiang Qin finished her words, the few disciples dashed towards Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang understood that she could not fight against them. She carried the little white tiger and flew away immediately.

“It’s not going to be easy for you to escape today. Go after her! I want her dead today!” Jiang Qin said coldly.

A few shadows dashed into midair.

Ye Qingtang’s face was still covered by sticky blood, but now, she could not be bothered by that anymore.

She was now certain that Jiang Qin wanted her dead.

If it was a one-to-one fight, Ye Qingtang might still have a chance to beat the disciples. However... her opponents outnumbered her, and they obviously did not want her to be alive today.

Ye Qingtang could only look ahead and try to speed up as much as she could.

Suddenly, a familiar voice came out from Ye Qingtang’s pocket.

“Head towards the southeast.”

Ling Yan’s voice came from the voice transmission stone in her pocket. Ye Qingtang was stunned for a second. She took a glance at the people chasing behind her and changed her direction immediately without question. She flew towards the direction Ling Yan specified.

After a short while, Ye Qingtang saw an area among the forests in the Land of Infinite Demons that was surrounded by heavy fog. Under the fog that even extended to the sky, there seemed to be no end. She could sense a strange aura from inside.

“That’s the... forbidden area of the Land of Infinite Demons?” Ye Qingtang looked towards the foggy area. She could feel the demonic air coming out from the fog even though she was not close to the place.

“You’re right. As long as you enter that place, your dilemma can be solved.” Ling Yan’s voice was calm. It was as if he knew the entire situation and could see Ye Qingtang right in front of him.

“...” Ye Qingtang was silent.

She had never been to the Land of Infinite Demons in her previous life, not mentioning the forbidden area.

However...

Ye Qingtang took a deep breath secretly as the disciples got closer. She hugged the little white tiger and dashed into the fog-covered area!
