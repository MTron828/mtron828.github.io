1430 Sisterhood 2

“I know that you are sensible. Both of you will be in the Jiang Family from now on and should prioritize the honor of the Jiang Family. As for whatever that happened before, just treat it as though it never happened before.” Jiang Liu was very satisfied with Ye You’s reply. They were both the children of the Jiang Family, and burying the hatchet was the best.

Subsequently, Jiang Liu looked at Ye Qingtang and said, “Tang Tang, don’t take whatever that happened in the past to heart as well.”

Ye Qingtang scoffed in her heart but put on an obedient front that was even more accurate than Ye You’s.

“There are no grudges between sisters. They were just trivial bickering and fights.”

Ye You gritted her teeth.

“Alright, alright. Both of you are sensible children.” Jiang Liu was filled with joy.

Very quickly, Ye Qingtang’s residence was arranged, and Jiang Liu sent Ye Qingtang and Beidou Demon Lord to rest first. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“You, Tang Tang and you were from the same clan previously. Have you heard about how Tang Tang was adopted?” Jiang Liu looked at Ye You and asked.

Ye Qingtang’s identity was verified, but it was still uncertain who her parents were. If they could find out where her bloodline was from, they could also find out whether her parents were still alive.

Ye You simply did not wish to talk about Ye Qingtang, but she had no choice but to reply gently now. “Uh… I’m not very clear as well. I only heard that Tang Tang was adopted by the Ye Family’s Family Master, but I don’t know the details…”

Jiang Liu nodded lightly without asking much. It was easy for them to investigate as long as they knew that Ye Qingtang was found in the First Mainland.

Jiang Liu and Elder Xu were occupied with finding out about Ye Qingtang’s parents. On the other hand, Ye You, who held her fury in for a long time, finally slammed the slab top in the courtyard after leaving everyone’s line of sight.

“Ye Qingtang, you’re seriously everywhere!”

“Sister You, Ye Qingtang has entered the Jiang Family now. She definitely did not forget about what happened in the past. That b*tch will seek revenge and think of ways to oppose you for sure. If she is allowed in the Jiang Family just like that… she will stir up many troubles.” Ye Xun looked at Ye You slyly.

“So what if she’s in the Jiang Family?” Ye You narrowed her eyes slightly. She would definitely get rid of Ye Qingtang.

Subsequently, she turned to look at Ye Xun. “Is Aunt Qin going to be back soon?”

Ye Xun was slightly dumbfounded.

The Aunt Qi whom Ye You referred to was Jiang Qin, the daughter of the Domain Monarch and the twin of Ye You’s mother. The twins shared a strong relationship, and Jiang Qin was extremely brokenhearted over the death of Ye You’s mother.

The search for Ye You in the First Mainland was personally planned by Jiang Qin, and after Ye You returned to the Jiang Family, Jiang Qin cared for Ye You like she was her own flesh and did not allow anyone to mistreat Ye You.

“Aunt Qin should be back today.” Ye Xun roughly guessed Ye You’s plans.

A sneer formed on Ye You’s face as she left.

In the evening, Jiang Qin and her husband returned.

Jiang Qin was already very old, but she took great care of her appearance and looked twenty-six years old at most. Aloof and arrogant, she was extremely gifted and doted on by the Domain Monarch while her husband was a renowned powerful figure in the Central Mainland.

“Is the Ancient You Clan courting death? They almost spoiled my plans this time.” Jiang Qin frowned immediately when she returned to the Jiang Residence.
