Chapter 2655 Not Gentle At All (4)

Therefore, no matter what, Ye Qingtang was not inclined to believe in her first conjecture. But her second conjecture was somewhat terrifying

Could it be that this black tower was only targeting the Paragon and her?

If she was really the reincarnation of the Paragon, then in a sense, she and the Paragon were the same person. In this way, it was reasonable that the tower only targeted the two of them. It seemed to be targeting the two of them, but it was actually targeting only one person.

However, if Ye Qingtang’s second guess was correct… it brought about a new question. Why was the black tower targeting her and the Paragon?

“Sister Ye Yue, this tower is not as simple as it appears.” The Paragon frowned. “I feel that it is only targeting… you and I.”

The Paragon was naturally an extremely intelligent person to be able to become an Immortal Emperor. Her conjecture was nearly identical to Ye Qingtang’s.

The only difference was that Ye Qingtang speculated that she was the reincarnation of the Paragon, while the Paragon speculated that she and Ye Qingtang were twin sisters.

The corners of Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched. She really wanted to tell this gentle Sister Ah Yao that they could not possibly be twin sisters… it was more likely that the Paragon was her ancestor.

Before Ye Qingtang could speak, a terrifying aura suddenly burst out from the surroundings. In just a short moment, Ye Qingtang and the Paragon were completely engulfed.

“Who is it?”

A cold glint flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes as she surveyed her surroundings.

In the next second, a few men in black robes floated out of the void.

“The Heavenly Demon Tribe…”

Ye Qingtang was slightly taken aback when she saw the black-robed men in the air.

However, Ye Qingtang returned to her senses in an instant.

Over the past two years, she had lived with Feng Wuyin and Feng Jiuyou in the Great Immortal Temple and never once appeared on the outside. The Heavenly Demon Tribe would not be able to find them even if they wanted to. But now, she had encountered them.

“Ha… Ye Yue, how dare you ruin our Heavenly Demon Tribe’s business,” one of the black-robed men shouted coldly.

Ye Qingtang sized them up. These people were indeed from the Heavenly Demon Tribe.

As one of the supreme peak forces of the Divine Venerate Domain, the Heavenly Demon Tribe would never miss the opening of the Fourth Domain legacy. Many of their branch powers also came along.

Before Ye Qingtang could speak, the black-robed men were stunned.

“Two Ye Yues?!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The leader of the black-robed men frowned and looked at Ye Qingtang before sizing up the Paragon beside her.

Apart from their clothes and auras, they were completely identical.

“Twins?”

One of the black-robed men asked in confusion.

Ye Qingtang was at a loss for words. Not twins… she swore they were not twins. “Sister Ye Yue, is this your enemy?”

The Paragon asked Ye Qingtang in a soft voice.

“I guess so.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

The Paragon suddenly said, “That’s great. I just thought of a way to confirm the effects of the black tower.”

Ye Qingtang was confused. She did not understand what the Paragon meant. However, in the next second, an extremely cold glint surfaced in the eyes of the Paragon.

The heads of several black-robed men instantly separated from their bodies and fell to the ground, leaving their leader utterly dumbstruck.

Ye Qingtang was also stunned. She was wrong. Sister Ah Yao was not gentle at all…
