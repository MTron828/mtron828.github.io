Chapter 2322: President (4)

“President, you are too kind. I am only doing what I should be doing. Those kids have always had pretty good potential, they deserve their current achievements.”

Like that, the 16-year-old Ye Qingtang called the 17-year-old Qin Feng and the others “kids” without any hesitation.

“I heard Wen Qi say that you have a very unique view toward martial arts. I also observed Qin Feng’s moves earlier. You seem to have made quite a number of adjustments to the techniques?” Wu Fengling asked.

Ye Qingtang nodded.

Wu Fengling continued. “It will be the Inter-Academy Competition in just a few months. For the past few competitions, our Netherworld Academy did not do too well. As the President, I feel very guilty over this. But now, you have given me hope.”

Ye Qingtang’s sharp instincts detected the underlying meaning behind Wu Fengling’s words. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Wu Fengling went on. “There are still a few months left until then. I wonder if you are interested in teaching a few students?”

It was then that Wu Fengling finally revealed his intentions.

Ye Qingtang looked at Wu Fengling with a strange expression.

“I am not that skilled and there isn’t much time left. I am afraid…”

Wu Fengling waved. “Do not worry about that. As long as you do what you can, that is more than enough. Moreover, you hadn’t taught Qin Feng and the others for very long and the results are already very good. The Netherworld Academy needs a teacher like you. I wonder if you are willing to do this for the Netherworld Academy.”

Ye Qingtang was somewhat hesitant. Her goal was just to make use of the Wind-Calming Pearl to leave this mainland. Qin Feng and the others managed to improve so rapidly partly because they had cultivated in the secret room in the fiendcelestial’s tomb. Otherwise, they would not have progressed at such terrifying speeds.

However, Ye Qingtang found it difficult to refuse Wu Fengling.

This was a President who was willing to sacrifice his own life for his students. He deserved everyone’s respect.

Thinking of how Wu Fengling would have to face his fate in the future, Ye Qingtang couldn’t help lamenting over it. If…

If she could produce more exceptional teenagers, would they be able to overcome that future catastrophe?

Ye Qingtang remained silent for a moment. Many powerful factions had indeed been coming in and out of the fiendcelestial’s tomb over the recent period. It was impossible for her to bring another batch of students into the tomb to cultivate. But her martial arts knowledge from her previous life could help some of the students become stronger.

Although they would not be able to break through to the next stage, they could still improve by quite a bit. They could be like Qin Feng, able to challenge an opponent who had a higher cultivation level than him.

This was the outcome of the future changes in the practice of martial arts.

“I can try, but I cannot guarantee the results. And I have one condition. I cannot teach too many people at one time, so you cannot give me too many students. Moreover, while I am teaching, no other teacher is allowed to interfere with my methods and the students also have to adhere to my arrangements. Otherwise, I will have no choice but to decline your offer.” Ye Qingtang spoke very frankly.

She was willing to contribute to the academy but she had her limits.

Wu Fengling appeared very satisfied with her words.

“I agree to all of your terms. Later on, I will send those students over. Don’t worry, I will limit the number to about six or seven, or maybe even less. Qin Feng and the others will remain your core students. If you find that any one of the students is not suitable, you can refuse to accept them.”

As Wu Fengling was giving Ye Qingtang a very high degree of autonomy, Ye Qingtang was able to accept it with peace of mind.
