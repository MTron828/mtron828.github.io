Chapter 1721: Frozen Ice Fields (1)

Ye Qingtang spent a long time walking upon the Frozen Ice Fields, in accordance to the skull’s instructions. Icy winds continuously assaulted her body to the point that her already-fair face was so cold that it had completely drained of color. If not for the warmth of Little White Tiger in her arms, she would probably have frozen to death.

That skull had said that there were three areas to this mystic realm. Although he didn’t point out the exact direction of the Cemetery of the True Gods, Ye Qingtang surmised that since she had to pass through the Frozen Ice Fields and the Scorched Hot Lands before arriving at the cemetery. It was likely that the cemetery would be situated in the innermost depths of the mystic realm. All she had to do was to walk in the opposite direction of where she came from.

On the way, Ye Qingtang saw plenty of frozen corpses. She tried to find traces of Jiang Shaobai and the rest, but the Frozen Ice Fields were so vast that it was near-impossible to find anyone.

“Is anyone there?”

A familiar voice suddenly sounded out.

“That’s Sang Feiyu’s voice.” Having been alone for so long, Ye Qingtang couldn’t help being excited at hearing a familiar voice. She quickened her steps and hurried over to the source.

Sang Feiyu’s voice had come over from a patch of frozen trees.

As she carried Little White Tiger, Ye Qingtang carefully navigated her way around those trees which were covered in sharp, spiky icicles. She lightened her steps.

Sang Feiyu’s voice sounded increasingly clear as she approached the source. She seemed to be calling out for something, and also softly humming an old tune to herself now and then.

“That woman still has the mood to hum to herself under such circumstances? Looks like she isn’t in any danger.” Little White Tiger was impressed by Sang Feiyu’s lighthearted attitude.

However...

When Ye Qingtang arrived at the source of the voice, she saw a wide smile on Sang Feiyu’s delicate little face. Those frozen, white lips were split apart in a jagged manner and instead of a pink tongue between those lips, a bloodied, icy vine was sticking out.

“Is there anyone who can come and accompany me...”

Sang Feiyu’s voice sounded out once again. But this time, Ye Qingtang was not at all inclined to step forward. In her arms, Little White Tiger widened its eyes at the sight and it nearly threw up its insides.

The Sang Feiyu before them was no longer human.

Her petite frame had been split into four sections by an icy vine. Her limbs had been torn apart and then connected back together by icy vines which penetrated the open wounds on her body like barbed wire. Her head had also been wound back to the body. The icy vine protruding out of her lips had entered her head via an opening in her neck. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“It’s so cold here... who can come accompany me...” The vine in Sang Feiyu’s mouth kept wriggling about. The frozen blood on it looked exceptionally demonic.

“She is... still alive... she is still conscious...” Little White Tiger widened its eyes as it noticed the despondency and bitter pain in Sang Feiyu’s eyes. Her features were twisted in pain and it was clear that she did not intend for the words to be coming out from her mouth.

She had become this icy vine’s plaything...

But she was still completely conscious.

The disturbing sight made Ye Qingtang nauseous as she stared at Sang Feiyu, who had been a happy, chatty girl not too long ago. She watched as the icy vine manipulated the girl’s broken limbs like a puppet, and how every movement caused gut-wrenching pain to Sang Feiyu.
