Chapter 332: Sword Boy and Attendant Girl (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The next morning, Ye Qingtang and the other three people walked up the stairs to the inner sect under the envious eyes of many outer sect disciples.

The outer and inner sect were linked by an illusory door, and beyond this door, the outer sect would not be able to see the inner sect at all.

Entering the illusory door once again, Ye Qingtang had a mood entirely different from in her previous lifetime.

It was just a door apart, but the pavilions in the inner sect were lingering with spirit energy, and the amount of energy in the entire area simply could not be compared to the outer sect.

In the inner sect, all the disciples each lived in independent small courtyards, and the new disciples were led to the northern wing.

The warden brought Ye Qingtang to her yard and continued bringing Ji Xianyuan and the rest to their respective residence.

Ye Qingtang looked at the elegant yard before her and lifted a hand, wanting to open the door.

But before Ye Qingtang’s hand touched the door, it was already hurriedly opened by someone from the inside.

A shy head popped out from behind the door. It was a young boy who looked only about eleven or twelve years old. His big and bright eyes fell on Ye Qingtang, and once he saw an inner sect waist tablet on Ye Qingtang’s waist, his eyes suddenly brightened. Hurriedly opening the door wide open, he showed a bright smile on his tiny, fair face as he walked out quickly.

“Lady Ye, Ni Shang and I have been waiting for you. The courtyard is already cleaned up. We hope that you’re satisfied with it.”

Ye Qingtang looked at the child before her, and a thought stroke her.

The special treatment for inner sect disciples was not only in their place of residence and cultivation environment. Their day-to-day meals and clothing were served by people appointed by the sect.

After entering the inner sect, every inner sect disciple would be accompanied by a young sword boy and attendant girl as arranged by the sect. These two people would take care of everything for the inner sect disciples.

The growing child before Ye Qingtang should be the sword boy whom Xuanling Sect allocated to wait on her while Ni Shang as mentioned… should be the attendant girl.

“Lady Ye, hurry in.” The sword boy welcomed Ye Qingtang into the courtyard respectfully.

The courtyard was not too big, but when compared to the outer sect’s residence, it was many times better. Although the sword boy and attendant girl lived here as well, they stayed in the side-room. It could be said that the entire courtyard was for Ye Qingtang to use only.

“What is your name?” Ye Qingtang asked the sword boy.

“My name is Fei Ying,” replied the sword boy.

“Fei Ying?” Ye Qingtang was slightly taken aback, and a surprised look flashed across her eyes as she looked at the young boy before him.

The sword boys and attendant girls in the inner sect were not ordinary servants. According to the rules of the sect, only those recommended by powerful people had the qualifications to participate in the sect’s entrance assessment. However, natural endowment and talent were not only present in descendants of influential family clans, and some gifted children occasionally appeared in ordinary families.

It was just that these children did not have a good enough background to become a sect disciple. However, sects had given these gifted kids from a normal background some opportunities.

Those who were young and had pretty good natural endowments could be recruited into the sect through another mean to become sword boys and attendant girls and wait on inner sect disciples.

Honestly speaking, the position of these sword boys and attendant girls in the inner sect might just be slightly higher than those of outer sect disciples.
