Chapter 2269: Hidden Danger (2)

Eyes scanning the dark, dim Evil Soul Forest, Ye Qingtang felt somewhat tired. She leaned against the cold wall and shut her eyes.

During this period of time, the various factions would continuously surge toward the fiendcelestial’s tomb because of the Temple of Paragon’s reward notice.

Ye Qingtang did not plan to get entangled with those factions under such circumstances. So she decided to lay low for a few days and observe the situation first, before entering the fiendcelestial’s tomb again.

Just as Ye Qingtang was entering dreamland…

A streak of light secretly flew in from outside the Evil Soul Forest. The light passed through the entire Evil Soul Forest, flying straight toward the fiendcelestial’s tomb.

As the door to the fiendcelestial’s tomb was opened, the various factions had surged inside the moment they discovered the entrance.

Two figures hidden in the darkness floated in mid-air as they peered down at those factions rushing into the fiendcelestial’s tomb.

“My lord, it is as you predicted. The various factions have all entered the fiendcelestial’s tomb. A stooped-over old man cupped his fists respectfully at the black-clad elder.

The elder floated in mid-air with his hands crossed behind his back. Dressed in black and wearing a black mask, all that was revealed were his two eyes, which shimmered subtly. He stared coldly at the living beings surging into the fiendcelestial’s tomb. There was no warmth at all in those eyes at all.

“But I didn’t expect them to find a way into the tomb so quickly,” the elder said.

The old man also looked puzzled.

“I also didn’t expect this. My lord, when you disclosed information about the fiendcelestial’s eye to the Temple of Paragon, and then had the temple announce the news, I also made the arrangements to have our men merge in with the various factions so that they could guide them toward the method to open the door. But… our men arrived only to see that the door was already opened.”

The elder was also puzzled.

According to their plans, the fiendcelestial’s tomb should only be opened at a certain point. But now, the fiendcelestial’s tomb was opened earlier than they expected.

“Don’t tell me the Temple of Paragon also sent their own men here?” The old man guessed.

The elder shook his head slightly.

“Even the Temple of Paragon doesn’t know how to open the entrance to the tomb.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Yes, my lord.”

The elder narrowed his eyes as his gaze landed on the fiendcelestial’s tomb in the middle of the mountain. Up in mid-air, he could see the entire mountain. Under the faint moonlight, wisps of aura seemed to drift up endlessly from that deathly-still mountain.

“My lord, regardless of when this door was opened, the results would be the same. None of the various factions who entered the tomb would make it out alive,” the old man said in a low voice.

“Everyone in the Second Domain wishes to find the treasure in the tomb. But none of them knows that this tomb is a place where one will never return from.”

The elder said, “If the Temple of Paragon did not suddenly express an interest in that thing, I wouldn’t have gotten the chance to bring forward this plan.”

“Yes, but we just don’t know why the Temple of Paragon is suddenly interested in the fiendcelestial’s eye. I tried to probe but couldn’t find any information.”

“Don’t go sticking your nose into the Temple of Paragon’s affairs. Now is not the time to get into conflict with them.”

“Yes, my lord.”

The elder didn’t speak again. He looked at the rising aura drifting up from the mountain. Narrowing his eyes, a black pearl suddenly shot out from his hand and flew toward the mountain, disappearing inside.
