A moment later, the Yongle Tribe General returned to the hall with Ye Qingtang and the vessel.

“Ancestor, the vessel is ready. Where is the soul? Can you take it out?” The Yongle Tribe General asked Ye Qingtang.

“Alright.” Ye Qingtang took out a purple-gold gourd from her space ring.

The Yongle Tribe General was dumbfounded. If he was not mistaken, Ye Qingtang took out a huge gourd from her ring??

She was able to retrieve an item from a small ring?

The Yongle Tribe General had never seen or heard of such a thing.

“Ancestor, did you take out this gourd from your ring just now?” The Yongle Tribe General could not hold back his curiosity.

Ye Qingtang did not deny it and nodded immediately. “I took it out from my space ring. Why? Is there a problem?”

Ye Qingtang was slightly puzzled. Could it be that souls could not be placed in space rings?

The Yongle Tribe General became even more curious. “Ancestor… you mentioned a space ring just now? What is a space ring?”

Ye Qingtang, “…”

Ye Qingtang was struck speechless but she soon recovered. Everything in this realm was very primitive and there was no such thing as forging divine weapons or treasures. These demons had never seen any space rings before. To the demons, these things were akin to divine powers and martial art techniques.

This time, Ye Qingtang explained patiently, “There’s no need to be so amazed. This is a divine weapon that can store everything.”

“It’s something so wondrous?!” The Yongle Tribe General stared in disbelief at the space ring Ye Qingtang was wearing. He asked, “Ancestor, can I please ask you to demonstrate? Can my vessel also be placed inside?”

They stored their treasures in cellars or treasure vaults. They had never thought of storing them in rings.

Ye Qingtang was rather exasperated. But she was already used to his curiosity. Since the Yongle Tribe General had already made Qin Feng and the rest demonstrate their skills, it was not a big deal to show him the use of her space ring.

“Alright, let’s try.” Ye Qingtang tossed the vessel into her space ring.

The Yongle Tribe General was instantly shocked. He did not get a clear look earlier when Ye Qingtang took out the gourd. It was different now. He saw Ye Qingtang toss the vessel into her space ring. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Very quickly, Ye Qingtang took out the vessel again.

The Yongle Tribe General exclaimed, “It’s said that the Demon Emperor entered the Realm of Ascension, far away from this realm. It seems like it’s true. Ancestor… these heaven-defying treasures must have been brought from the Realm of Ascension.”

Ye Qingtang smiled. “You can think of it this way. The martial art techniques that we used previously also came from the Realm of Ascension.”

“It’s really too mysterious… what kind of exciting world is that… if I can enter it in my lifetime and see its mysteries, I can die without regrets.” The Yongle Tribe General sighed.

“Don’t worry. As long as you want to, there will be a chance,” Ye Qingtang said to the Yongle Tribe General.

‘Young man, follow me to the Realm of Ascension and be my bodyguard… if you are willing, I will bring you there immediately.’

Of course, Ye Qingtang could only think such words in her heart.. It was not appropriate to say them out loud.
