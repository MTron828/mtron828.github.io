The Grotto-heaven Peak Master’s eyes landed on the surrounding Ye Family disciples, who were fighting hard as he shouted loudly.

As he spoke, an indescribable breath of destruction emerged around the Grotto-heaven Peak Master’s body. It condensed all the energy sources of the Yang Lord and self-detonated, destroying this energy…

“Grotto-heaven Peak Master!!”

Many Ye Family disciples were teary as they looked at the Grotto-heaven Peak Master not far away.

However, the self-destruction force of a Yang Lord was massive and had a wide range. If they did not flee, they would also be roped in.

Ultimately, many Ye Family disciples stopped the fight and fled away at the fastest speed they had ever used in their lives. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Hahaha… Hahahaha!!”

Seeing that all the Ye Family disciples had left, the Grotto-heaven Peak Master was finally relieved

“General… Valley Master… Old Valley Master… We are not… a disgrace… to Falling Sky Valley… or this mainland, right!” The Grotto-heaven Peak Master clung onto the alarmed Ancient You Clan Yang Lord elderly tightly and turned into a blinding light.

Boom, boom, boom!!!

A deafening sound reverberated throughout the place. A corner of the valley crumbled instantly and was destroyed by the self-destructive force of a Yang Lord.

The ground shattered, and the forest collapsed. It was like a natural disaster.

After this loud crash, the Ancient You Clan masses nearby, who did not even know what happened, fell victim to the self-destructive force of a Yang Lord and were buried six feet under forever.

This valley was a distance away from Heaven City, and cultivators could fly in the air.

At this moment, Ye Qingtang witnessed the scene from the sky and clenched her fists tightly. She bowed deeply at Grotto-heaven Peak Master in the air without uttering a word. Subsequently, an icy glint flashed across her eyes as she charged toward the Ancient You Clan masses.

Swoosh!

A sword gleam slashed across and penetrated through the bodies of several Ancient You Clan powerful figures.

Ye Qingtang landed on the ground swiftly.

“Eldest Young Lady…”

Suddenly, a weak voice came from nearby. Ye Qingtang looked behind instinctively, and her eyes dilated slightly.

“Ye Leng…” What entered Ye Qingtang’s eyes was a shocking sight, and she rushed to the teen’s side.

Ye Leng was no stranger to Ye Qingtang. He was the son of a Formidable Heavens Dynasty prince. Elder Bai Kui doted on him dearly and brought him from Formidable Heavens Dynasty to the Ye Family and changed his last name to ‘Ye’.

However, the once vigorous and energetic teen was sliced apart at his waist, and his remaining upper body only had an arm left.

“Eldest… Eldest Young Lady…” Ye Leng’s eyes were full of despair, and it reflected Ye Qingtang’s figure. He trembled slightly.

“I… am not scared…”

Ye Qingtang walked forward slowly, kneeled down, and placed Ye Leng’s head on herself.

“Eldest… Eldest Young Lady… Am I… about to die…” Ye Leng’s face was ghastly pale.

It was as though Ye Qingtang’s throat was choked with charcoal, which caused a piercing burn.

“Eldest… Eldest Young Lady… I… I am in pain…” Ye Leng wanted to move his body but did not have the strength to.

Ye Qingtang’s clothes were already stained red by the blood on Ye Leng’s body. She looked at Ye Leng’s remaining upper body, and the initially-youthful face was gradually covered by a pale sheet of ash…

Ye Qingtang took a deep breath and suppressed all the sorrow that filled her heart. She said softly.

“I am sorry…”

A three-word whisper seemed to deplete all her energy.
