Chapter 1908: Paragon Level (2)

This thing was not that heavy.

Letting out a light chuckle, Ye Qingtang lifted the gold-gilded black box with apparent ease. Little White Tiger scurried out and shook out its messy fur. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Just as Ye Qingtang was about to tease Little White Tiger, the box suddenly vibrated in her hands.

In the next second...

A large pile of Dharma artifacts streamed out of the gold-gilded black box.

Within seconds, the pile of artifacts had grown into the size of a small hill.

Ye Qingtang, “...”

What was going on?!

Little White Tiger was also dumbstruck. It had clearly seen that the box only contained one finger bone. Where did all these Dharma artifacts come from?

“Could this gold-gilded black box be a space storage item?” The corners of Little White Tiger’s lips twitched as it gazed at the growing pile of artifacts. The quantity was enough to fill a hundred gold-gilded black boxes.

“But I have never seen them before.” Ye Qingtang furrowed her brows slightly.

Little White Tiger circled Ye Qingtang, sniffing the quickly-dissipating aura of death around her.

“It must have something to do with that finger bone. Didn’t the undead mention before that only the Holy Lord herself could use her items? I think your aura must have been affected by the finger bone. After absorbing it, your aura has been tainted by that of the Holy Lord. As a result, you managed to open the gold-gilded black box properly this time.”

Little White Tiger tried to comprehend the strange situation that was happening before its eyes. It gasped when it noticed Ye Qingtang’s current level.

“Damn, what did you eat to advance so quickly?!”

Ye Qingtang looked at Little White Tiger in exasperation. She had no idea herself.

“This is really strange. These things didn’t happen when you first came to the Temple of Shadows. Something must have happened in the mystic realm, which enabled you to open this gold-gilded black box.” The more Little White Tiger thought about it, the stranger things appeared.

The first seal of the gold-gilded black box was the key to opening it. If they hadn’t managed to break it, they would never have gotten the Holy Lord of Shadows’ finger bone.

“I would like to know too.” Ye Qingtang also didn’t understand what had triggered all this. Nevertheless, she felt rather dazzled by all the Dharma artifacts piled on the ground. She picked up a few to take a closer look.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes nearly popped out of their sockets as she studied the items.

The artifacts of this Holy Lord were really something. Even if she were to gather all the artifacts owned by all the clans in First Mainland, they would be no match for these at all.

Ye Qingtang’s heart nearly stopped just by the sight of them. Every single one of these Dharma artifacts was at least Paragon level. But such divine artifacts had a limitation.

Only those who were high-level practitioners themselves could use them. They would be useless to anyone of a lower level.

Ye Qingtang already spotted several artifacts that would only be activated by Emperor-level practitioners.

Having just attained the Paragon level, Ye Qingtang thought that she already possessed tremendous power. But standing before all these Dharma artifacts, she suddenly felt like her powers were completely insignificant.

Ye Qingtang’s impression of the Holy Lord of Shadows instantly shot up.

There were too many artifacts for Ye Qingtang to try them one at a time. She would be doomed if one of the undead came in and saw her trying them out. With that thought in mind, Ye Qingtang had no reason to hold back.

Who cared if she could or couldn’t use it now? She would just stuff everything into her space ring first.

A great harvest?

That’s exactly what this was!

She had already gotten several artifacts from Baili Xi and Mu Feiru, as well as all those she had previously accumulated. Now she also had the artifacts that belonged to the Holy Lord...
