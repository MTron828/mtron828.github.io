This was the first time Ye Qingtang was experiencing the Ancient God Karma Tunnel. Everything she knew she had heard from the big yellow dog. She did not know anything much.

The concentration of spirit energy in this place was not as high as her own Deity Ocean space, but it was still much thicker than in the Second Domain.

“Help!”

Just as Ye Qingtang was deep in thought, she heard a cry for help. Almost instinctively, Ye Qingtang sized up the stream in front of her.

Ahead popped out of the water, and two arms were flailing around.

Seeing that, Ye Qingtang flew forward and hauled the figure up from the water.

After bringing him ashore, Ye Qingtang realized that the person who was drowning was a teenager of about 12 to 13 years of age. He was fair and clean. Though at this moment, the youth’s face was pale as he panted heavily as if he had gotten a great shock.

“are you alright?” Ye Qingtang asked the youth.

“No… I was scared to death…!” The young man touched the water droplets on his face.

Ye Qingtang stared at the youth with a strange expression. This youth was not an ordinary person. Although he was young, his martial skills were at least at the Divine Lord stage!

Ye Qingtang looked at the stream and frowned. “Is there a demon underwater?”

“Demon?” The youth was taken aback before shaking his head. “No…”

“No?” Ye Qingtang looked at the youth in confusion. “If not, why were you drowning?”

“Lwas thirsty and wanted to fill my bottle with water, but I accidentally fell in. I don’t know how to swim!” the young man said.

Ye Qingtang, “…”

Ye Qingtang could not accept the youth’s explanation.

As a dignified Divine Lord, even if he really lost his footing and fell into the water, what was there to fear? Even an ordinary martial artist would not shout for help.

“Are you unable to fly or don’t know how to hold your breath?” Ye Qingtang asked.

Even if he didn’t know how to swim, with his abilities at the Divine Lord stage, it would be very easy for him to hold his breath in the water for a day or two.

“know.” The young man was taken aback. He replied instinctively.

“Then why did you shout for help just now?” Ye Qingtang shook her head.

“Well… I was nervous!” Only then did the young man realize that he did not need to be afraid of water.

“Elder Sister, no matter what, thank you very much for this.” The young man cupped his fists respectfully at Ye Qingtang.

“No problem,” Ye Qingtang said calmly.

“Elder Sister, what’s your name? I’ll remember your name and repay you in the future,” the young man said with a smile.

“Ye Qingtang,” Ye Qingtang replied honestly.

‘Without giving the youth a chance to speak, Ye Qingtang asked, “By the way, this is my first time here and I’m not familiar with this place. May I ask where this is?”

“Here?” The young man looked around. “We are in the mid-part of Mt. Zhong. This is a place for medicinal herbs. There are many precious herbs on the mountain, but people at our level don’t dare to go too high up the mountain. There are more demon beasts on the mountain.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“People at our level…” Ye Qingtang stared at the youth. Even a Divine Lord stage practitioner did not dare to go up the mountain to pick herbs?

“I just snuck up the mountain and wanted to see if there were any herbs nearby. However, I saw an Emperor level practitioner. He was killed by an Immortal Emperor, so I ran away.” The youth sighed.

Ye Qingtang, “…”

Emperor… Immortal Emperor?

“There are Immortal Emperors here?” Ye Qingtang asked softly.

The youth nodded vehemently. “Yes… she’s a beautiful lady, but she’s very cruel. She also looks like you…”

At that point, the young man stared at Ye Qingtang and his expression changed drastically.. “You… you are the Immortal Emperor who killed the Emperor-level practitioner!”
