Chapter 1245: Birthday Celebration (1) 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Just as everyone’s gaze converged on Ye Qingtang, a loud laugh suddenly rang out.

A tall, handsome old man slowly walked over. This old man’s hair was graying, and he had a long white beard. Although traces of his age could be seen in the wrinkles around his eyes, his eyes were brighter and more piercing than those of a man in his prime.

“Holy Lord of Shadows, it has been a long time.” The old man smiled as he walked towards Ye Qingtang. This old man was the Grand Elder of the Luo Family, Luo Qufeng.

Luo Qufeng had participated in the battle with the powerful cultivators from the Second Domain and so knew the Holy Lord of Shadows, who had led troops to join the battle.

Ye Qingtang maintained her composure when she saw Luo Qufeng, who had sent people to hunt her down in her previous life, walk over. The smile on her lips deepened, and she said coolly,

“Luo Qufeng, it’s been a long time.”

Luo Qufeng said with a smile, “I have not seen the Holy Lord since that battle thousands of years ago. What a joy it is to see you once more today.”

Ye Qingtang smiled blandly but did not reply.

When the Temple of Shadows was at its peak, powers like the Luo Family were illustrious in Central Mainland, but still, they could not compare with the Temple of Shadows.

“Men, invite the Holy Lord of Shadows to take a seat.” With that, Luo Qufeng gestured for Ye Qingtang to enter.

The banquet had not yet started, and besides the huge giants, no one else was seated.

Ye Qingtang sat down naturally while maintaining her composure. She continued to smile faintly while her gaze remained detached as if she was above everything.

The Undead who followed Ye Qingtang also sat around her.

Luo Qufeng made some small talk with Ye Qingtang. She either expertly responded with a few words or smiled wordlessly. The Undead from the Temple of Shadows noted it all.

The birthday banquet had been about to begin, but many were shocked by the arrival of the Holy Lord of Shadows. Now that Ye Qingtang and the Undead were seated, Luo Qufeng also smilingly invited the other guests to take their seats.

“Burp, isn’t it rather warm?” After Mi Qiu sat down with Lan Yu and the others, it felt that its surroundings were rather warm. It turned its head to look around and saw a scarlet figure sitting nearby.

It was a man from the Blaze Clan.

The Blaze Clan was one of the Fire Tribes. They had no flesh, blood, or bones. Their entire bodies were composed of flint and lava. Their bodies were always aflame, and they were highly resistant to any kind of fire-related attacks.

The special characteristics of the Blaze Clan meant that whenever they appeared, the temperature of the surroundings rose. Their blazing fire was only extinguished at the moment of their death.

“Can you sit farther away from me?” A cold voice suddenly said in the Blaze Clan member’s ear.

A youth from the Ice Clan was sitting next to the man from the Blaze Clan. He was as transparent as crystal and looked like an ice sculpture. His exquisite face that was formed from frost was now dripping with clear droplets of water, making him look like he had just been hauled out from the water.

The man from the Blaze Clan looked at the youth from the Ice Clan, puzzled. “Why?”

The youth from the Ice Clan impatiently curled his lip that looked as if it had been carved from ice. “You’re too hot.”

“But… it’s cooler near you…” The man from the Blaze Clan said innocently as he quietly moved his chair.

“…” The face of the youth from the Ice Clan darkened immediately.
