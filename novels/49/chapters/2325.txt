Chapter 2326: Medicine Faculty (1)

“Jinyun? Why are you here?” One of the female students from the medicine faculty was surprised at the sight of Gong Jinyun amongst the group.

These were the selection trials of the medicine faculty. Students from the other faculties would usually not come to watch.

After all…

Those other students would not be able to understand what was going on during the medicine faculty trials anyway.

“I came over to take a look.” Gong Jinyun scratched his head bashfully as he answered the teenage girl.

Curiosity rose in the hearts of the rest as they observed the interaction between Gong Jinyun and the girl.

“Who is she? Gong Jinyun’s girlfriend?” Nangong Lie asked Hang Wenwei.

Hang Wenwei replied, “She is Yu Siqi. She is Gong Jinyun’s alchemist partner.”

Most of the martial arts students in the academy would form partnerships with the medicine faculty alchemists so that they could ensure a steady supply of elixirs.

The more powerful martial arts practitioners would be able to choose the more talented alchemists as their partners. Hang Wenwei and his group were in the top 10 and so their alchemist partners would definitely also be amongst the top.

When Lei Yan and the others first came to the medicine faculty, they had also wanted to find some medicine faculty students to be their partners. But they were utterly scorned. No one was willing to even glance at them. But now…

A voice suddenly called out.

Everyone turned to see a tall, slender youth with imperious features strolling over. Several medicine faculty students were tagging along behind him.

“Is that Song Yanhan?” Lei Yan’s eyes brightened at the sight of the newcomer.

“Who is Song Yanhan?” Jing Ze asked.

Lei Yan replied in a low voice, “You don’t even know Song Yanhan? I say, Senior Brother… do you know nothing about the other faculties aside from your own?”

Jing Ze nodded honestly.

Lei Yan held his forehead in exasperation. “Song Yanhan is the top alchemist in the medicine faculty. I heard that his elixir-refining skills are even better than most of the teachers in the faculty. I am sure that you know our academy once produced a Grand Master alchemist? There are rumors that Song Yanhan might become the second legendary figure to come out of our medicine faculty.”

Lei Yan had been extremely ignorant when he first entered the academy. After hearing about alchemist partners and Song Yanhan’s reputation, he had rushed over to the medicine faculty, asking to be his partner.

In the end…

He had been kicked out of the faculty grounds before he could even come face to face with Song Yanhan.

Thereafter, Lei Yan realized that an alchemist of Song Yanhan’s level was widely admired, not just within the academy but even on the outside. He had countless practitioners who hoped to obtain elixirs from him.

There have been many elite students who wished to be partners with Song Yanhan but they were all rejected. The only one who caught Song Yanhan’s eye was Wu Fengling’s personal disciple Ran Mo.

But with Wu Fengling as his master, there was no need for Wu Fengling to partner with an alchemist. As a result, Song Yanhan had no partner.

Song Yanhan’s sudden appearance now had many people confused.

In response, Qin Feng glanced at Song Yanhan, the questioning in his eyes apparent.

Song Yanhan’s expression was cold and his attitude arrogant. He only looked at Qin Feng and ignored the others.

“It will be the Inter-Academy Competition in a few months. I don’t have any martial arts partner,” Song Yanhan said.
