Chapter 2019: Strong Backup (1)

The Temple of Shadows!

The traitorous demon tribes all widened their eyes in disbelief as the Eternal Dynasty soldiers looked even more shocked.

“Why would the Temple of Shadows appear here?”

The eight tribe leaders...

The demons and soldiers who had been wreaking havoc freely suddenly felt intense fear.

“Kill them.” An order rippled through the air.

They lifted their head and saw a huge demon dragon flying above them. On top of its head was a girl wearing a golden mask and this sent intense shivers down their spine.

A golden mask...

That was the symbol of the Holy Lord of Shadows.

The eight tribe leaders all transformed into demons on her orders as howling winds began blowing at them.

The thousands of soldiers and soldiers had no chance against the eight tribe leaders.

Under the attack of the eight tribe leaders, the troops fell instantly. They had no room to retaliate at all.

Many of the demons wanted to escape but they had no way of leaving the battlefield at all. With a light wave of her hands, Ye Qingtang summoned arcs of light which rained down and erased everything...

Nothing survived the rain of light. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The tiger demon’s eyes widened and his mouth dropped opened in disbelief

“This... this...”

The Northland Demon Tribe had always been weak and unsuited for battle due to their inexperience, which was why they had been defeated so easily.

To them, the Eternal Dynasty Troops and the traitorous demons were not opponents that they could go up against.

But right now...

The enemies who had destroyed their home and slaughtered their own were now being vaporised.

Tens of thousands were dead in the blink of an eye.

How terrifying their power was!

“Don’t worry and hand this over to us. This is a healing elixir. Use it to heal yourself first, gather those kids up and follow us back to the Temple of Shadows.” The Northstar Demon Lord patted the shell-shocked tiger demon’s shoulder reassuringly.

The tiger demon quickly regained his senses and gratefulness filled his face.

“The Temple of Shadows... is really willing to take us in?”

The Northstar Demon Lord nodded.

The tiger demon was trembling with excitement. The Temple of Shadows was the top power in the Central Mainland and was not something the Demons could scoff at.

And now they were willing to take them in..

“Are there any more dogs of the Ancient You Clan?” The Demon Tribe Leader walked over to the tiger demon with his battle axe, still unsatisfied with his kills.

They still have troops scattered in the north.

The Demon Tribe Leader smiled widely as he heard this.

“Let’s have a battle to see who can kill more, shall we?” the Demon Tribe Leader’s eyes swept across the other tribe leaders.

They had no objections.

In the next second, the eight tribe leaders all vanished from where they were standing and made the north their hunting ground.

The tiger demon stared at all of this in shock but was in awe of the power of the Temple of Shadows.

Ye Qingtang felt relieved as she saw the Northstar Demon Lord comforting the demon cubs .She made her way to the north on Ming Di, looking for their enemies.

The eight tribe leaders were all killing joyfully and she didn’t want them to leave anyone alive as well.

But she still had questions for these people and had to make sure to capture a few of them alive.
