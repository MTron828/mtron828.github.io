Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

That feeler quietly wrapped around Ye Qingtang’s finger. Together, they drew a string of bizarre runes on the stone door.

The runes left no mark on the door at all.

The crowd wanted to peep at the method to open the door, but their attempts were blocked by the mammoth body of the Night Soul Beast.

Lei Yan and the rest were hidden in a dark corner and had observed the entire proceedings.

“That black-robed person… don’t tell me she’s the protector of the Evil Soul Forest? Inheritance of the fiendcelestial’s will… is there such a thing?” Yun Chen frowned slightly.

“That fellow is able to control the Night Soul Beast Unbelievable. But… aren’t we supposed to find a way to rescue Little Senior Sister now?” Nangong Lie prompted.

“It’s not the right time to make our move now.. Let’s wait and see first,” Yun Chen replied.

The teenagers nodded.

Yun Chen looked at Qin Feng. “Qin Feng, do you think that black-robed person is really able to open the stone door?”

Qin Feng kept quiet for a moment, before nodding slightly.

“If she cannot do it, it would have been suicide for her to appear.”

“Never expected there to be so much action inside the Evil Soul Forest. I wonder where Boss is. If he can’t find us, he’ll probably be very anxious.” Jing Ze gave a small smile.

Their failure to protect Mu Ziying was a thorn in their hearts. How could they bear to face Ye Qing? They had to find a chance to rescue Mu Ziying first.

Just as the teenagers were discussing in a low voice, a dark red light suddenly lit up behind the Night Soul Beast!DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The red light shot into the sky, a profound aura suddenly spreading across the entire mountain.

The expressions of the various factions changed.

The massive Night Soul Beast slowly turned around, with the black-robed Ye Qingtang once again standing on its back. In the next instance, the stone door once again appeared in the crowd’s line of sight.

And everyone was quietly stunned by that sight.

The sealed stone door had been opened!

The crowd had been full of suspicion about the black-robed person, but now they were utterly dumbstruck.

She actually…

To think she managed to open the door to the fiendcelestial’s tomb!

All sorts of emotions and thoughts surged through the various factions. Faced with this situation, their doubts about this black-robed person had lessened considerably.

They all knew how big of an obstacle that stone door was.

Even the demon child was unable to do anything about that stone door. And since the Temple of Paragon didn’t prompt them about how to open the door when it released its news, everyone had been completely despondent. Quite a number of people even wanted to just destroy the entire mountain.

But in the blink of an eye, that black-robed person easily opened that stone door!

Although they could not be sure if everything the black-robed person said was true, everyone was certain about one point.

This black-robed person was closely interlinked with the Evil Soul Forest and the fiendcelestial. She might really be the protector of this Evil Soul Forest.

Otherwise…

How did she manage to control the Night Soul Beast?

And not only that, she opened the stone door so easily?!

Everyone was looking at Ye Qingtang with more caution now.

Ye Qingtang observed the reactions of everyone, but she appeared impassive.

In reality, after the Second Domain factions spent all that time on the fiendcelestial’s tomb in her previous life, after it was opened, details of this tomb had spread across the world and became common knowledge.
