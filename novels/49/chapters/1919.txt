Chapter 1920: Ming Di (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

From her calculations, Ming Di had already been sealed for over ten thousand years. Even Ming Gu had started to forget about it.

Ye Qingtang’s mind set to work immediately after hearing the full story.

That youth had already set his sights on the Temple of Shadows and it was a fact that all the other ancient clans were no match for him. If he were to attach again, Ye Qingtang would be completely helpless.

She couldn’t help but direct her thoughts towards the sealed Ming Di.

She had no idea if she could even use Ming Di but had no choice but to go with it.

The abyss prison was in the deepest part of the Temple of Shadows. Ye Qingtang sent Ming Gu and the others away with a few excuses so she could be free to head towards the abyss prison.

To get there, she had to follow a pitch-black path that seemed to have no end. The further she descended, the faster the temperature dropped.

The Holy Lord of Shadows had sealed Ming Di personally, which meant that no one could open the abyss prison other than her. Even though Ye Qingtang had absorbed her power from the finger bone, she wasn’t sure whether she could open the abyss prison.

After walking for a long time, Ye Qingtang finally reached the deepest part of the Temple of Shadows. In front of her stood a stone door so huge it was terrifying.

With just a glance, she could tell that it was almost a hundred meters tall, with strange carvings inscribed on it.

“You really intend to release Ming Di?” Little White Tiger glanced at Ye Qingtang with unease. This was dangerous. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

According to Ming Gu, Ming Di was indeed very strong. While she didn’t know how powerful it was exactly, it would probably be one of the strongest beings in the Central Mainland.

Ye Qingtang was a mere imposter. Even though she had the aura of the Holy Lord of Shadows around her after absorbing the power from the finger bone, the reality was that she was nothing compared to the Holy Lord.

“Ming Di was sealed here by the Holy Lord of Shadows and probably hates her for it. If its anger blows up on you when you’re in there, you won’t even have a body left for me to bury.”

“I’m not that stupid. Ming Gu told me that Ming Di is sealed behind this stone. His powers are completely suppressed unless he can escape from the seal,” Ye Qingtang said as she took out a dragon-shaped sculpture from her space ring.

The sculpture was the size of her hand and she had found it in the gold-gilded black box along with the other Dharma treasures.

Ye Qingtang had tried searching among the Dharma treasures after hearing Ming Gu’s story. Luckily, the Holy Lord of Shadows hadn’t removed the seal on Ming Di before she left and Ye Qingtang was able to find it.

“As long as the seal isn’t removed, Ming Di is not leaving these doors.”

Little White Tiger sighed in relief when it saw that Ye Qingtang had done ample preparation before proceeding with this madness.

“How do you plan to convince Ming Di? Even the Holy Lord of Shadows couldn’t get it to listen to her ideals, so it’s not going to be easy for you.”

“How would I know if I don’t try?” Taking a deep breath, Ye Qingtang approached the stone doors cautiously. She raised her hands and tried infusing the energy that she had gotten from the finger bone into the stone door.

A dull sound emanated from the stone door and dust swirled as the doors opened slowly.

It was dark behind the stone doors. Ye Qingtang glanced at Little White Tiger, mustered up her courage and walked in.

“You really are too brave,” Little White Tiger muttered as it guarded the outside for Ye Qingtang.

For now, all it could do was wait.
