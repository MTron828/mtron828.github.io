After a while, Ye Qingtang walked forward while Feng Wuyin followed on her right. The two black-robed men behind didn’t make any moves. All they did was continue to monitor Feng Wuyin from afar.

If Ye Qingtang had guessed right, those two black-robed men should be from the Heavenly Demon Tribe. Or at the very least, they must be somehow linked to the Heavenly Demon Tribe.

After about an hour, Ye Qingtang and Feng Wuyin returned to the Feng family estate.

“Sister Ye Yue, why did you guys take so long?”

Seeing that Ye Qingtang and Feng Wuyin had returned, Feng Jiuyou immediately ran over.

“Ah, as it’s my first time going to the market so I asked Wuyin to take me around, so we’re a little late,” Ye Qingtang said softly to the young Feng Jiuyou.

“Indeed. There aren’t such large markets in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain, right? You probably won’t be able to see any such markets when you retum to the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain.” Feng Cang suddenly appeared. He threw Ye Qingtang a glance before smiling coldly.

“Haha, Brother Feng Cang, don’t be so sarcastic. After all, she has never seen the martial arts culture of the Divine Venerate Domain. It’s only reasonable that she is curious about everything and wants to have a closer look, right?” One of the other youths laughed.

“Heh heh, what’s the saying? Humans strive for greater heights, while water flows to lower regions. It’s indeed very normal for a cultivator from the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain to want to see the scenery of our Divine Venerate Domain,” another youth piped up.

Feng Cang sneered at Ye Qingtang. “That may be so, but there’s another saying: Know your place. With her skills, she is probably already nothing in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain, but still dares to come to the Divine Venerate Domain. With that weak, frail body of hers, she will be annihilated if she’s not

careful.”

“Brother Feng Cang, how can you say that about Sister Ye Yue? She is amazing!” Feng Wuyin clenched his fists.

“That’s right. Sister Ye Yue even saved me before. Brother Feng Cang, you can’t say that. Also, don’t look down on the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain’s martial arts practitioners. We were just born in different places. There’s no choice in that. Besides, I’ve never been to the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain or the Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Blue Sky Domain either, I want to take a look too. I want to go to places I’ve never been to take a look. What’s wrong with that?” Feng Jiuyou was annoyed.

Hearing that, Feng Cang glanced at Feng Wuyin and Feng Jiuyou and said coldly, “How old are you guys? What do you know?”

Seeing that Feng Wuyin and Feng Jiuyou still wanted to say something, Ye Qingtang shook her head and told them not to continue. After all, she was just an outsider in the Feng family. She did not want Feng Wuyin and Feng Jiuyou to quarrel with others because of her.

Moreover, she was just a passerby in this distant era. Ye Qingtang would not care what the people in this era said about her. After all, people like Feng Cang would probably be gone by the time she returned to her era.

Ye Qingtang let Feng Wuyin and Feng Jiuyou cultivate outside while she returned to the guest room, She then took out the small wooden box from her space ring.

‘The moment the wooden box appeared, the Heavenly Demon Pearl in Ye Qingtang’s body started to spin rapidly again, as if it had some unknown link with the small wooden box in her hand.

However, after studying it for a long time, Ye Qingtang did not know what was so special about this small wooden box, nor did she know what it had to do with the Heavenly Demon Pear! in her body.

If one had to say something about this wooden box, it could only be said that it was indeed very hard.
