Chapter 1914: Tricks (2)

The way Ye Qingtang had scared the enemy away without even raising a finger made the Undead Clan of the Temple of Shadows feel as though they were being led by the Holy Lord of Shadows ten thousand years ago again.

Under the gaze of the Undead Clan, Ye Qingtang strolled back into the grand hall.

While the effeminate youth was an extremely strong opponent in the eyes of the Undead of the Temple of Shadow, what did they have to fear now that they had the Holy Lord of Shadows with them?

Ye Qingtang only patted her chest in relief after leaving the watchful eyes of the Undead Clan.

Where was this youth from?

How could he be so strong?

Ye Qingtang felt that there were probably only a handful of people from the entire mainland who could fight with this youth.

Meanwhile, Little White Tiger’s mouth twisted as it saw Ye Qingtang’s guilty expression.

“You’ve got guts. If he had found out that you had used the Mirror of Illusions to trick him, you would have been utterly destroyed in seconds with not even a body left to bury.”

“Of course. I don’t even know what he wanted, and he even defeated Ming Wang. If I hadn’t tried such a dangerous move, would the Temple of Shadows and have met with the same fate as the Nanlin Clan?” Ye Qingtang knew completely well just how dangerous the mysterious youth was.

But she...

She had no choice!

The youth was ruthless, having wiped out several clans in succession. There was no way he would have spared them if he realized that they didn’t have what he needed.

Thank goodness she had managed to trick him.

“I don’t think he is going to just give up. If what he wants is in the Temple of Shadows, he’ll be back sooner or later. What are you going to do when you can’t use the Mirror of Illusions again?” Little White Tiger said with a grimace.

Ye Qingtang’s head was pounding. Even though they had managed to pull through this time, the youth wasn’t going to be easy to deal with. They had no idea when he would be back and they couldn’t use the Mirror of Illusions again within a certain time period. She had to come up with another way to deal with him.

Back in her room, Ye Qingtang poured out all the Dharma treasures from her gold-gilded black box. Perhaps there would be something she could use to overcome this crisis.

But what she found only made her even more miserable.

The items from the Holy Lord of Shadows were all of the highest level and any one of them were weapons that would frighten heaven and hell.

But...

She couldn’t use them.

After searching for two days and two nights and almost going through all of the Holy Lord of Shadows’s Dharma treasures, she finally found one that someone of the Paragon level could use.

It was a black ring with a black skull on it. Ye Qingtang had no idea what the ring was made of but it was the only thing that responded to her current power level when she tried it on.

Ye Qingtang put the ring on hastily and put the other Dharma treasures into her space ring.

Before Ye Qingtang could even take a break to figure out what the ring could do, Xue Fu came to report that the Ancient Mu Clan and other ancient clans had arrived at the Temple of Shadows, wanting to see the Holy Lord of Shadows.

Ye Qingtang was speechless.

What in the world was happening now?

These ancient clans usually didn’t interact with the Temple of Shadows much but now they were all here at the same time as though they had coordinated the visit. They were all in the main hall, waiting to see the Holy Lord of Shadows.

There was definitely more to this.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com
