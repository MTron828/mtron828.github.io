Chapter 777 Giving You Face (3)

The two Peerless School disciples never thought that there would actually be such a reckless disciple in Falling Sky Valley. As they realized that they took the enemy lightly, a murderous expression filled their faces.

Then, the two of them lifted their swords and charged forward. A bright and intense light enveloped the two of them as they forcefully slashed their swords down at where Ye Qingtang was standing.

Two swords that were each several meters long directly slew Ye Qingtang’s thin frame.

However, just as the sword auras were about to land, a transparent air hood enshrouded Ye Qingtang, and the sword auras crashed directly on it!

With a loud boom, clouds of dust swirled in the surroundings while Ye Qingtang was unscathed.

In the next second, a cold gleam flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

“Break!”

The air hood around her exploded suddenly, and a powerful burst of air charged towards the two Peerless School disciples.

Under the sweeping wave of air, the two Peerless School disciples were directly propelled away!

Everyone at the square was dumbfounded.

It goes without saying how mighty the Peerless School was; even the skills of a random ordinary disciple was above those of Falling Sky Valley’s number one talent, Xuanyuan Lie.

However…

All by herself, Ye Qingtang actually beat those two Peerless School disciples up to the point where they could no longer retaliate.

For a moment…

Everyone was muddled.

“You two are merely ordinary disciples of the Peerless School. How dare you be so arrogant in front of me? If your Peerless School’s elder was here, perhaps I’d give him some face.” Ye Qingtang looked at those dust-covered Peerless School disciples coldly as though she was enfolded by a layer of austerity.

The two Peerless School disciples steadied themselves in a fluster. In the short moment when they exchanged blows earlier on, they sensed that the other party’s skills were above theirs.

What Ye Qingtang said, however, caused the two of them to halt their actions.

It was simply impossible for Falling Sky Valley to nurture such a powerful disciple.

Moreover, this person clearly knew their identities but still dared to attack them…

At that instant, a trace of hesitation emerged on the faces of the two Peerless School people.

They originally thought that the youth before them was merely a Falling Sky Valley disciple, yet now… this person still dared to attack them. Unless this person was an idiot, how would he dare to offend the Peerless School?

If he was really an idiot, why would his skills be so powerful?

“Could this fellow be from the hidden clan?” the Peerless School disciple said hesitantly.

In the entire mainland, the Peerless School was already the top force, and its disciples were the most outstanding. However, between the various forces, there were many ancient family clans hidden from the world.

Most of those hidden clans had vanished from the world’s eyes and only occasionally appeared as rumored.

The strong heritage of the hidden clan was simply unfathomable.

Even the current number one family clan in Nine Nights Dynasty, Ouyang family clan, was inadequate to be associated with the rumored hidden clan.

“Who exactly are you?” The Peerless School disciple asked coldly.

Ye Qingtang said coldly, “In the sea of clouds at Mount Qin, perhaps you all will know my identity.”

When Ye Qingtang said that, the two Peerless School disciples’ expression stiffened.

As rumored, the last place the hidden clan returned to and lived in seclusion was in the sea of clouds at Mount Qin.

This fellow… UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Could he really be a disciple of those hidden clans?!
