Chapter 576 Immortals and Buddhas (3)

Ye Qingtang quietly swore to herself that one day when she was powerful enough to see the truth of this world, she would find out the reason behind the disappearance of the Fourth Domain and the fall of those Immortals and Buddhas…

The night was silent. The blood moon hanging in the dark sky was increasingly blinding.

The sinister laughter of the Buddha statue had completely faded away and was nowhere near them.

It was at that moment when Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder finally sighed in relief.

“Holy Lady, look!!”

Suddenly, the Blood Moon Elder pointed at the deep well not far away.

Ye Qingtang looked in the direction that the Blood Moon Elder was pointing at, and surprise emerged in her eyes.

There was faint energy turbulence of an array formation from the pitch-dark well.

Ye Qingtang walked towards the well.

After a while, Ye Qingtang stood beside the well with a slight frown.

The well had already dried, but there was a simple black box at the bottom of it.

“This well is protected by an array formation. Could it be that its to protect this small box?” Ye Qingtang was in thought.

Once a Spiritual Abode was formed in the bodies of supreme figures, it was similar to an independent inter-spatial world, and a space ring was no longer needed. All the treasures obtained during their lifetime would be stored in the Spiritual Abode. Once the extremely powerful figures died and their Spiritual Abode turned into a mystic realm, their treasures would be stranded in the mystic realm and become a certain destiny.

“This small black box should be one of the treasures stored in the Spiritual Abode of that supreme figure!” Delight emerged in Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

Ye Qingtang initially wanted to enter the well and retrieve the small box, but before she could get close to it, the power of the array formation caused her to retreat backward.

“Can this array formation be broken?” Ye Qingtang looked at the Blood Moon Elder.

Then, the Blood Moon Elder walked forward and inspected the well for a moment before nodding finally. “Holy Lady, this array formation has already lost most of its powers. It is not difficult to break, but it would require some time.”

“I’ll leave it to you then.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

Without saying anything else, the Blood Moon Elder immediately started to break the array formation.

After an hour later, the array formation protecting the deep well was finally broken by the Blood Moon Elder.

As the array formation disappeared, Ye Qingtang swiftly retrieved the small box from the deep well.

After opening the small box, she realized that it was an old talisman.

“What is this…” Ye Qingtang inspected it closely yet could not recognize it.

The Blood Moon Elder inched forward as well. After looking at it, he shook his head and said, “This item does not seem like something produced from this era. The image on the talisman is extremely mysterious. It could be an Array Formation In A Talisman, or it could be something else.”

Ye Qingtang was rather speechless. When did she require the Blood Moon Elder’s reminder…

But regardless of what this was, what was sealed in the talisman was definitely a consumable product that could only be used once.

Ye Qingtang would absolutely not brashly use it just to test what item it was.

Qingtang brought the Blood Moon Elder away.

There were countless other similar houses in the blood-colored city. After gaining an item, Ye Qingtang naturally would not leave easily and searched the other houses for some time.

However, Ye Qingtang no longer saw any treasures protected by array formations this time.

Such was a mystic realm. Everything was dependent on destinies, and not every house would have treasures sealed in the Spiritual Abode.
