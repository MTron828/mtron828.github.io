Ye Qingtang shook her head with a smile. “No, I must go this time. If you don’t agree, I will look for Senior Brother Gu.”

Then, Ye Qingtang wanted to leave.

Qin Huan hurriedly stopped her and said, “Take it that I’m afraid of you. Senior Brother Gu’s side is even more dangerous. What… what should I say about you…”

Qin Huan had a troubled expression on his face. He was aware of this junior sister’s stubbornness, but no matter how, he really could not understand why Ye Qingtang wanted to join such a dangerous mission.

Although the sect elders already said that they would be handsomely rewarded as long as they found any clues before the missions were allocated… this was at the cost of one’s life.

Why was this little girl so insistent on taking this risk?

“Agree or disagree?” Ye Qingtang raised a brow slightly and did not intend to explain too much to Qin Huan.

Xuanling Sect took this matter exceptionally seriously, and Ye Qingtang noticed this. The inner sect entrance assessment would take place one month later, and Ye Qingtang might not even have the chance to participate in the assessment as a new disciple.

Thus…

She must grasp every opportunity. If she could find any clues in this mission, perhaps she would have a chance to take part in the assessment as an exception.

It was hence why Ye Qingtang specially rushed over.

Qin Huan had no other choice but to brace himself and agree.

“But let me set this clear first: you must follow me tightly throughout this mission.” Qin Huan could not help but warn her again.

Ye Qingtang obviously nodded perfunctorily. Once they were on the mission, whatever she wanted to do was not what Qin Huan could control.

“Then do you want to make preparations first?” Qin Huan asked.

Ye Qingtang chuckled. “I’ve prepared it a long time ago. The things are stored in my space ring.”

“…” The corner of Qin Huan’s lips twitched a little. He deeply felt that he seemed to have fallen into Ye Qingtang’s trap!

Qin Huan did not have time to argue with Ye Qingtang about it and only hurried to the gathering point outside the sect along with her.

There were already seven to eight people standing at the gathering point when they reached.

Qin Huan brought Ye Qingtang over and said to the leading disciple, “Senior Brother Dai, this is Ye Qingtang, Junior Sister Ye. She volunteered to participate in our mission this time.”

Dai Changming was tall and had a pretty face. His straight brows were slightly furrowed as he looked straight at Ye Qingtang, who was standing behind Qin Huan. “Ye Qingtang? I’ve never heard of her. Is she ranked in the first thousand in the outer sect?”

Qin Huan’s expression was a little awkward. He was about to say something, but someone was one step ahead of him.

“Ye Qingtang? Qin Huan, are you joking! She is a new disciple who just entered the sect for a month or so. What qualification does she have to participate in this mission?” That voice was sharp with a hint of animosity.

Qin Huan looked in the direction of the voice, and this took him aback slightly.

Zhou Qu, with a face of dismay, appeared from behind Dai Changming. His devious eyes glared at Ye Qingtang resentfully.

Frustration filled Qin Huan when he saw Zhou Qu before him. Zhou Qu happened to be ranked in the top one thousand in the outer sect and was assigned on this mission as well. However…

It did not cross Qin Huan’s mind that Zhou Qu would actually be in the same team as him. Then, he could not help but look at Ye Qingtang behind him worriedly.

Not long ago, Zhou Xuan placed Ye Qingtang in his team because of his private grudge, but he himself died in the end.

Zhou Qu was Zhou Xuan’s younger brother, and he already had a feud with Ye Qingtang. Now that they were actually going to be on the same team…𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m
