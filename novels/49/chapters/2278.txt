Chapter 2279: Secret Room (3)

Originally Ye Qingtang had been eager to leave, but now, she had no intention of leaving so soon. She had never heard anyone talk about this array formation in her previous life. It was undeniable that it was very effective.

There was no way Ye Qingtang would miss out on such an amazing cultivation ground.

Focusing her mind once more, Ye Qingtang started to absorb the aura coming out from the array formation.

As she cultivated, Ye Qingtang didn’t notice a nondescript black ball hidden at the ceiling of the secret room. As the black snake killed, the black ball absorbed the souls of countless powerful practitioners.

But once Ye Qingtang entered the secret room and sat down on the array formation to cultivate, the energy stored inside the black ball was transformed by the array formation and then absorbed into Ye Qingtang’s body…

The feeling of absorbing this kind of energy was very miraculous. Albeit strange, somehow it could slowly be transformed.

It was like something had already pre-cultivated this energy before. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

As Ye Qingtang cultivated, the energy stored inside the hidden black ball was also being drawn out by the array formation.

The feeling of having one’s powers rapidly increased was intoxicating. Ye Qingtang seemed to forget her surroundings and her fatigue, fully concentrated on cultivating.

It was like she was submerged in darkness, with countless streams of light flashing by and then shooting straight into her body…

After a long time, Ye Qingtang felt like the power she had been storing had reached its maximum level.

Finally she opened her eyes, which glimmered with delight.

There was a limit to Ye Qingtang’s way of cultivating while suppressing her cultivation stage. If she stored too much power, she would not be able to continue cultivating. She had to release this restriction.

But she had a good amount of energy stored. Ye Qingtang could already feel her body was filled with energy just waiting to be released. She was not sure after unleashing that energy, how high her powers would increase.

A conservative estimate would be an increase of at least three to four Heaven levels.

She was now at the Paragon Sixth Heaven level. If she removed the restriction, it should be no problem for her to reach the Ninth Heaven level.

If the effects were good, she might even reach the Divine Lord stage.

In the Second Domain, Ye Qingtang’s powers were considered mediocre. And this energy came from the Second Domain itself, so it was naturally extremely effective.

Ye Qingtang tried again. She confirmed that the amount of energy she had stored was already at maximum levels. After unleashing it, she would definitely ascend to a higher cultivation stage, but she did not dare to do that here. After all, she always placed caution above everything else.

Standing up, Ye Qingtang peered out of the hole.

During this period, although she had been cultivating, she did not let down her guard at all. But she didn’t spot any signs of the black snake returning.

After observing for a while longer, and confirming that the black snake was nowhere near, she prepared to leave the secret room.

But before that, Ye Qingtang studied the array formation.

This array formation was so useful. She planned to go back and analyze it further.

Another idea popped into her head. She already got what she wanted from the fiendcelestial’s tomb. Now that the Evil Fruit had been absorbed, the black snake would no longer target her. She didn’t desire any other item in the treasure trove either.

After she released the restriction on her stored energy, perhaps she could find another opportunity to return and continue cultivating.

Once she had decided, Ye Qingtang finally led the Night Soul Beast out of the secret room.
