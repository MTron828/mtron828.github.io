Chapter 104: Illusion Array (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Just when everyone thought that they would have to wait for at least half a day, a formidable roar came out of the illusion array all of a sudden.

The roar seemed to make the cloud layers below them to tremble.

“Ahhhhhhh!!” A horrifying scream was heard along the roar of the beast. The piercing scream seemed to be able to tear people apart.

The two sounds hit everyone like a flash of lightning.

Previously relaxed people were now all covered with goosebumps.

“What was that?”

“What is in the illusion array?”

The roaring sound of the beast greeted their ears constantly. It totally destroyed the calmness among everyone.

Such a deep roar had to be made from an extraordinary demonic beast. Was there a powerful demonic beast holding down the illusion array?

Suddenly, everyone’s good moods disappeared.

A stream of blue fog slowly drifted out of the illusion array the next second. A path emerged from the Eight Trigrams flags instantly, and a man fled out in panic from the array.

The young man who just entered the array a few moments ago was now pale and sweating heavily. The calmness he had before entering the array was long gone, and only a few scratch marks were left on his face now.

No one knew what he had just encountered in the array. However, his reaction just now really shocked everyone who was present.

Though this young man possessed an orange spirit root, he should not be so weak. He only stayed in the array for a few moments before coming out.

“Next.” The middle-aged man took a quick glance at the young man and commanded.

The second candidate shivered. He was totally taken aback by the previous candidate’s reaction. However, he had no choice but to step into the array. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Everyone was having some deep thoughts after the second candidate entered the array. They looked towards the first candidate subconsciously. The young man was still panicking and upset.

Everyone knew what the situation was now, and no one asked him what he encountered in the array.

The rules of the sect assessment did not allow candidates to reveal such information. Furthermore, as a result of the competition happening between the candidates, the candidate would not give them any answer even if they asked.

This time, the candidate who entered the array did not escape immediately. However, the roaring sound of the beast rose one after another.

Soon, a streak of blue fog was seen, and this represented the end of the second candidate’s assessment.

Even though he lasted slightly longer than the first candidate, the duration was still alarmingly short.

Based on this speed, they would need only less than half a day to assess the hundreds of candidates here.

The next few candidates who entered the array all did not last very long. All of them came out with pale faces as if they had seen something terrifying.

The candidates who were still waiting were close to breaking down.

They thought that as long as they lasted long enough in the array, they could pass the assessment. Who knew that… things were much more complicated than what they imagined.

More than half of the candidates had finished the assessment in less than half a day. Lu Xiuwen would be the next one now.

He took a deep breath and stood in front of the array. He squinted his eyes as the array slowly opened up a path. Eventually, he walked in.

Among the clouds and fog, Lu Xiuwen did not have a clear view in front of him. He took a few steps forward, and the fog suddenly dispersed. He saw himself standing in a forest, and a pair of red eyes were staring at him through the gaps of the branches.
