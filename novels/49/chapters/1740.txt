Chapter 1741: Looking For Food (3)

“Bewitch it!” Ye Qingtang ordered. Little Heavenly Demon was momentarily startled, before opening its mouth and emitting its bewitching melody.

The moment that bewitching melody played out, the gigantic ice beast seemed to have been stopped by some hidden force. It stood there unmoving, its huge eyes filled with enchantment.

Taking advantage of this moment, Ye Qingtang raised her sword and focused all her energy onto her shimmering blade. The sword energy shot out in an arc right toward the soft belly region of that ice beast.

Fresh blood gushed out as a huge wound appeared across that ice beast’s belly.

The intense pain caused the ice beast to snap out of its trance. It’s head snapped towards Ye Qingtang with bloodshot eyes and howled viciously before charging toward her.

Little Heavenly Demon instinctively emitted its bewitching melody again when it saw the ice beast attacking Ye Qingtang.

The raging ice beast once again fell into a trance. Ye Qingtang immediately hacked away at the ice beast’s belly, finally splitting it open.

Having sustained such grave injuries, the ice beast could no longer rally and collapsed in a pool of blood. Up till its very last breath, it was probably still confused as to how it died at the hands of a weak little human.

Heaving a sigh of relief, Ye Qingtang felt her shoulders sag the moment the ice beast collapsed. But before she could move a single step, Little Heavenly Demon had already pounced happily toward the ice beast’s dead body. It grabbed onto the beast’s large paws and started chewing on it.

“Pffft...” Little Heavenly Demon immediately spat out the first mouthful, then wiped its own mouth in disgust.

Pteu! This tasted so gross...

Ye Qingtang couldn’t help chuckling as she watched the disdainful Little Heavenly Demon who looked like it had eaten something poisonous.

“Silly little thing. How hungry are you to just bite into it like that?”

The ice beast had very thick skin and tough flesh. Little Heavenly Demon’s tiny milk teeth probably just managed to scrape off a layer of dead skin. That must have tasted terrible.

Little Heavenly Demon looked extremely upset, as if it had been deceived.

This thing was totally inedible.

Amused, Ye Qingtang set Little Heavenly Demon aside. Making use of her sword, she carved off the ice beast’s thick skin and then sliced off a piece of the soft flesh underneath. She then ignited a black flame on her palm and started roasting the flesh.

Little Heavenly Demon’s expression was full of disdain. But as the smell of roasting meat slowly reached its little nose, its eyes suddenly brightened.

After seeing that the meat was nearly done, Ye Qingtang tried a bite. It was very delicious with none of the pungent taste of blood. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“...” This was even more delicious than she expected. Could it be that her black flame added flavor to the food?

Ye Qingtang didn’t dwell too much on it. She held out a piping hot piece of meat to Little Heavenly Demon’s mouth.

After being deceived before, Little Heavenly Demon was still hesitant. That earlier disgusting taste still lingered in its mouth. But the delicious smell of roasted meat tempted it, making it inch closer.

It had already been several days and Little Heavenly Demon was already starving after gobbling up all of the rations. In the end, it just shut its eyes and bravely took a bite.

Little Heavenly Demon immediately opened its eyes wide which sparkled like starlight. Holding its tiny paws to its cheeks filled with meat, it looked like it was about to float up to heaven in bliss.

Before meeting Ye Qingtang, Little Heavenly Demon had not much to eat at all. It was already very satisfied by the dried rations she had provided earlier. But this... this freshly-roasted meat was warm and fragrant. It instantly opened its eyes to a whole new world...

Delicious!!
