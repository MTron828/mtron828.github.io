Chapter 519: Paying Respects To The Guardian (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“We pay respects to the Guardian!”

Following right after the Blood Moon Division Head, the Blood Moon Branch Masters successively kowtowed to Ye Qingtang.

“…” Ye Qingtang was astonished.

She originally thought that her identity would definitely be exposed and she might perhaps die right there, but… the supposed Demonic Water seemed to have lost its effects with the passage of time. Otherwise, the crescent moon on her glabella and Blood Moon Aura should not remain.

Never would Ye Qingtang believe that the cheap younger brother she picked up on the road was… the Blood Moon Holy Lord, the supreme faith of the Blood Moon Sect.

“All of you may rise,” Ye Qingtang said and secretly heaved a sigh of relief, though there was no change in her expression as she pretended to be profound.

“Guardian, I have sinned. I did not know your true appearance… and even used the Demonic Water and offended you… Please convict me, Guardian!” The Blood Moon Division Head hung his head low, not daring to look up.

Offending the Blood Moon Guardian was a big sin. He was merely a Division Head and definitely should not have offended his superior like that.

“We have sinned!”

Immediately, all the Blood Moon Branch Masters said at the same time, and they could not stop quivering.

Looking at the reactions of all the Blood Moon Sect members, Ye Qingtang let out a breath slowly, though she still wore an indifferent expression on her face. She swept an aloof look across everyone and finally said slowly, “On account that everyone was thinking for Blood Moon Sect, this should not be viewed as an offense, and all of you are pardoned. Do not repeat it again.”

“Thank you, Guardian!” The Blood Moon Division Head rose slightly and let out a huge sigh. Similarly, the several Blood Moon Branch Masters stood up as well.

The Blood Moon Elder looked up at Soul Severing Troll who still hold him in the air. “Aren’t you going to let your hands off me!”

Upon hearing that, Soul Severing Troll cautiously bent down and placed the Blood Moon Elder on the ground gently.

“I’m very sorry… Previously…” Soul Severing Troll frowned, attempting to explain himself.

“There’s no need for more words. Since the Guardian has pardoned you all, there’s nothing much to say,” said the Blood Moon Elder coldly.

Soul Severing Troll nodded without uttering a word further.

“Guardian, may I ask who this is…” The Blood Moon Division Head looked at the Blood Moon Elder.

“One of the thirty-six Blood Moon Elders, Hong Heqing.” The Blood Moon Elder raised a brow.

“Hong Heqing, it’s you?!” The Blood Moon Division Head was taken aback. As the Blood Moon Division Head, he naturally recognized Hong Heqing and even had some enmity with him from a long time ago.

If not for the fact that Ye Qingtang’s identity as the Blood Moon Guardian was solidified, the Blood Moon Division Head would not believe the Blood Moon Elder even if he reported his name.

However, in everyone’s eyes then, there was no doubt that Ye Qingtang was a Blood Moon Guardian while this person was following beside Ye Qingtang, and everyone would not doubt his words.

“Haha…” The Blood Moon Elder glared at the Blood Moon Division Head and scoffed.

The Blood Moon Division Head was rather awkward. They had some grudges, but now that the Blood Moon Elder was following beside the Blood Moon Guardian, he probably would not badmouth him before the Guardian right…

“Alright.” Ye Qingtang waved a hand. “Our Blood Moon Sect just gained a tiny streak of revival and will not tolerate any internal strifes between you all. Any previous grudges will be written off here. If anyone refuses to accept this, you’re free to reason with me.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“I’ll follow as you say, Guardian.” The Blood Moon Division Head bowed with cupped fists.

“I dare not to disobey your orders, Guardian.” The Blood Moon Elder bowed in respect as well.

“Guardian, I am the Division Head of this Division, Jiang Chen,” the Blood Moon Division Head said softly as he walked forward.
