Chapter 257: Deer City (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Where are the people here?” Zhou Qu scanned through the city. There was nothing on the street besides dust that was blown by the wind.

The whole city was deadly silent.

Ye Qingtang frowned and glanced at the empty street. Just now, she did not notice anything as she was trying to avoid the sand. However, now, she could feel that the whole city was surrounded by a layer of an abnormal breath.

“Try to knock the doors,” Dai Changming said to others.

Some disciples tried to knock the locked doors along the street. However, there was no one answering the doors.

The whole street was peculiar.

“Is it possible that they all stayed in the cellar to hide from the recent sandstorms?” One of the disciples suspected.

Dai Changming did not reply and quietly led the team forward to look for people.

However, they smelled blood after taking a few steps forward.

Everyone’s faces darkened.

Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes and saw a sword on the street a few meters apart. There was a pool of fresh blood beside the sword.

Ye Qingtang immediately went forward and held the sword. She was shocked when she took a glimpse at it.

“This belonged to the youth of the Wind Moon Sect,” Ye Qingtang said.

Her words caught Dai Changming’s attention. All of them saw the pool of blood on the ground. Apparently, it was left here not long ago.

“What happened? Why is the sword here? The blood stain…” Qin Huan felt that something was ominous.

Ye Qingtang was alarmed. The ability of the two inner sect disciples of the Wind Moon Sect was unbelievable. However, one of their swords and a pool of blood were left here.

Sect disciples would never leave their weapons unless they had no choice.

What exactly happened?

“What’s wrong here?” Dai Changming’s face was unpleasant.

Suddenly, Ye Qingtang’s eyes sparkled. She raised her head and looked around. She could sense a streak of an evil breath surrounding Deer City gradually. It was like a nightmare falling under the dusk.

“Something is not right. Senior Brother Dai, we need to leave this place immediately.” Ye Qingtang suddenly spoke.

Dai Changming stunned.

“Leave now? Both the wind and the sand are so strong. Where can we go?” Zhou Qu stared at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang did not even bother about Zhou Qu. She raised the sword in her hand and said, “The two people from the Wind Moon Sect might be involved in some accident.”

Dai Changming frowned heavily. He looked towards the storm outside the city and glanced at the sword in Ye Qingtang’s hand.

“Leave the city now!” He commanded.

No one knew what the two disciples of the Wind Moon Sect had encountered. However, no matter what they encountered, if even they could not defend themselves, the outer disciples would not even have a chance.

All disciples ran towards the horses at the entrance of the city without hesitation. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

However, the horses suddenly screamed and ran outside the city at the same time. It seemed that they were shocked and insane.
