Chapter 2182: Medicine Faculty (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Even now as students, every single one of them would be considered pretty good alchemists outside of the academy. The students from the other faculties would naturally be able to obtain more elixirs to help in their cultivation if they could become friends with these teenagers.

Lei Yan and the rest had been negligent in this aspect as they were already prepared to be kicked out of the school. The notion of making friends with the medicine faculty students did not even cross their minds. But the appearance of Ye Qingtang had given them hope. At Yun Chen’s reminder, the entire group had rushed over to the medicine faculty to see if they could find a few students to secure a good future supply of elixirs.

It was a reasonable plan, but a pity...

Things did not always go according to plan.

After searching for some time, none of the medicine faculty students were willing to partner with them. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Those medicine faculty students were no fools. They had limited elixirs on hand and would naturally wish to supply students who had a brighter future ahead of them.

As for Lei Yan and his gang... they did not meet their criteria.

There had long been rumors circulating the Netherworld Academy about how these people would be kicked out soon. The academy had already designated them as hopeless and it was only natural that the medicine faculty students would not want to waste their elixirs on this group.

“Aren’t you guys with Yun Chen? Just get Yun Chen to refine some elixirs if you need them?” One of the medicine faculty teenagers spoke up impatiently. He looked at Lei Yan and his gang like they were just a swarm of pesky flies.

A bunch of jokers like them wanted to ally with the medicine faculty students?

Only a fool would give them elixirs.

Lei Yan and the rest were taken aback by the teenager’s words. They glanced at Yun Chen.

Yun Chen maintained his smile.

“Yes, you guys have Yun Chen right? Why are you looking for others? Moreover... apart from him, do you think anyone here would give you elixirs?” Another teenager added rudely.

Nangong Lie had been speaking in a cordial manner but his face now darkened at the words of those two teenagers.

He had known Yun Chen from before. They had entered the Netherworld Academy at the same time and used to belong to the martial arts faculty together. But because of Yun Chen’s weak physical condition, he had been transferred to the medicine faculty.

However, Yun Chen’s situation at the medicine faculty was not without its difficulties. His Drifting Cloud Bloodline drastically reduced the success rate of his medicine cultivation and as a result, he was completely unable to supply others.

These two were both from the medicine faculty. How could they not know about Yun Chen’s situation? They had purposely singled out Yun Chen just to make him look bad.

“Don’t give us any if you don’t want to. Do you think we are that desperate for it?” Nangong Lie put up a brave front.

“Even if you are desperate for it, no one will give it to you. I advise you not to waste any more time here.” The medicine faculty teenagers smirked before turning to leave.

Lei Yan wanted to say something else but Nangong Lie stopped him.

“Don’t waste your breath. Can’t you tell they look down on us?”

The medicine faculty teenagers would only give out elixirs to those whom they deemed worthy. And this bunch had been deemed unworthy by those teenagers.

Lei Yan had come to the medicine faculty full of hope and expectations. But now, having failed to ally and even endured the ridicule of others, his face looked very grim.

Just as they turned to leave, they bumped into a slender figure.
