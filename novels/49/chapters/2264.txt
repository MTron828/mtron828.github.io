But after Ye Qingtang spied that black fruit, she was unable to tear her eyes away from it.

The Evil Fruit!

Ye Qingtang never expected that the fruit which she most desired would be growing on this demon tree in the fiendcelestial’s tomb.

To take it?

Or not to take it?

Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes.

The seal on the Heart of the Heavenly Dao was about to fade away. Without the Evil Fruit to subdue it, the Heart of the Heavenly Dao would be completely exposed.

At her current level, if the Heart of the Heavenly Dao was exposed, it would attract the attention of many powerful Second Domain practitioners. By then… she would need to return to how she lived in her former life, forever hiding in fear.

By this stage, the Night Soul Beast had already given up. But it suddenly noticed the way Ye Qingtang was looking at something growing on that demon tree. Hope rose in its heart.

But that glint of hope in its eyes immediately brought Ye Qingtang to her senses.

Yes, she had to get that Evil Fruit.

But now was not the time.

Looking at the Night Soul Beast’s reaction, Ye Qingtang knew that the things growing on that demon tree were probably the same as the other treasures here. Taking them would invite all sorts of terrifying dangers.

Mu Ziying and the rest were with her now. If she made any missteps, she would drag them all down with her.

Luckily, she now knew where the Evil Fruit was. She just had to lead Mu Ziying and the rest out of here first. Then she could find another chance to come back here to take it.

Turning away, Ye Qingtang allowed the desire in her eyes to disappear.

The Night Soul Beast’s eager face immediately fell once more.

Were humans so self-disciplined now?

Treasures were strewn across the ground and growing on trees, but no one wanted them?

This was not like humans at all!

“Let’s go.” Ye Qingtang composed herself and instructed Mu Ziying and the rest.

If she remembered correctly, the exit of the fiendcelestial’s tomb should be behind this skeleton.

Lei Yan and the others kept looking back as they moved forward. If not for Ye Qing’s stern warning, they probably would not be able to resist such a massive temptation.

They were no fools. They had experienced how dangerous this place was. If not for Ye Qing, they probably would not have made it so far but died much earlier on. Ye Qing must have her reasons for not letting them touch anything.

As they passed by the demon tree and skeleton, they found a dim tunnel hidden right behind. Ye Qingtang led the group into the tunnel, not touching anything at all.

Right after Ye Qingtang and the group entered the tunnel, the faint tinkling noise rang out again, but this time, it was going further away from them. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Ye Qingtang knew that now she had reached this point, those pursuing factions should no longer be a threat.

A treasure-filled place like this was enough to drive all those factions mad. How would they still remember her?

After walking quietly for over a dozen meters, the tunnel suddenly widened by a hundred times.

A dim cave appeared before them.

Multiple black monsters were crowded together in the cave, sleeping…

Lei Yan was nearly in tears from fright at the sight of them.

“Night…” Lei Yan was about to cry out but Ye Qingtang immediately covered his mouth, shushing him. Right in the center of the cave before them, were at least a hundred slumbering Night Soul Beasts all crowded together…

It was the Night Soul Beast’s period of hibernation.

The hearts of the teenagers nearly leaped out of their throats.
