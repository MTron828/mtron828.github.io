The Blood Moon Sect Elder replied. “How can swordsmanship be explained so simply? With the sword and sword intent in the heart, the said sword intent means…”

Although there was a great loss in the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s skills, he had cultivated for a long time. Even if he randomly said something, it was extremely profound to those outer sect disciples.

With just his talking skills, he won the compliments of many disciples in the outer sect. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

As the Blood Moon Sect Elder was about to make a high-sounding speech, he suddenly saw a familiar figure walking in his direction at top speed, which cut him from talking immediately.

“Senior Brother Zhou? Why are you not talking anymore?” Those disciples were still staring at the Blood Moon Sect Elder and waiting for him to continue talking but saw his face stiffen. They finally realized and looked in the direction that the Blood Moon Sect Elder was looking at.

This look gave those disciples a shock.

“Isn’t… isn’t that Senior Sister Ye?”

Although Ye Qingtang entered the sect for only a short time, she was an inner sect disciple now, and outer sect disciples like them naturally addressed her as ‘senior sister.’

Ye Qingtang’s entrance into the inner sect caused a stir in the outer sect, and many were still discussing the matter until that day.

However, no one had expected that Ye Qingtang, who just entered the inner sect for a few days, would actually return to the outer sect.

It should be known that disciples who entered the inner sect were different from outer sect disciples like them. Who would still return here?

“Why is Senior Sister Ye back?”

Everyone was filled with curiosity, and they did not sense that the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s face had already darkened unknowingly.

“Junior Brother Zhou, I’ve something to say. Come with me for a while,” Ye Qingtang said coldly the moment she reached the Blood Moon Sect Elder.

The disciples looked at the Blood Moon Sect Elder, who had a frozen expression.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder’s lips twitched, and he replied rather stiffly. “Alright.”

Then, Ye Qingtang brought the Blood Moon Sect Elder to a place without anyone.

The disciples stared blankly at the back view of those two people. They did hear of the tension between Ye Qingtang and Zhou Qu, as well as the rumors that Ye Qingtang had something to do with his brother’s death.

Now that Ye Qingtang suddenly came to look for Zhou Qu, was she here to pick a quarrel with him?

Just the thought of it caused them to feel numb. Right now, Ye Qingtang was an official inner sect disciple. How was Zhou Qu her opponent?

As everyone guessed, Ye Qingtang had already led the Blood Moon Sect Elder to an empty place.

“What are you looking for me for?” The Blood Moon Sect Elder looked at Ye Qingtang in annoyance. Without Ye Qingtang in the outer sect over the past few days, he was able to live very comfortably. Yet, who knew that this girl would actually return here again today!

Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes at the frustrated Blood Moon Sect Elder.

“What am I looking for you for? I’ve only been in the inner sect for a few days, and some outer sect disciples disappeared unknowingly. Shouldn’t you give me an explanation for this?”

There was a slight change in the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s eyes after hearing Ye Qingtang’s words, although he initially had a frustrated expression. His eyes shifted to a side as he mumbled. “Why are you asking me for an explanation for the disappearance of those disciples? It has nothing to do with me.”

“Nothing to do with you?” Ye Qingtang scoffed. “Do you think I believe that?”
