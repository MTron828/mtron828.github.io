Chapter 2186: Alchemy (1)

Teacher Feng’s expression was awful. He simply couldn’t understand why this newcomer, Teacher Ye tried so hard to get hold of an alchemy lab for Yun Chen without even knowing much about him.

But now, he could tell that the new teacher was completely oblivious and had no self-awareness.

“You’re not part of the medicine faculty, pardon me for not being able to lend you the alchemy lab.

Refining elixirs?

He probably couldn’t even differentiate the herbs.

“Teacher Feng, can I let Teacher Feng use my alchemy lab?” Yun Chen asked.

Yun Chen also didn’t know why Ye Qing suddenly had the idea of refining elixirs but since he was his teacher, he couldn’t just stand by and allow him to be embarrassed in front of everyone. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Teacher Feng’s brows knitted.

“The alchemy lab was allocated to you so it’s your decision to make. However, I have to remind you that the medicine faculty allocates a limited amount of herbs to every student. You’ll have to find ways to replenish it if they run out.

“The elixirs refined by you in the past month did not even satisfy the lowest standards set by the medicine faculty. You’ll have to consider carefully whether you can refine enough elixirs this month before you listen to just anyone and waste the herbs.”

Teacher Feng made himself clear. He wasn’t going to stop Yun Chen from lending others the alchemy lab, but they wouldn’t give out any more herbs other than the ones allocated to Yun Chen.

If Ye Qing wanted to have the herbs, he would have to take them from Yun Chen’s quota or purchase them on his own.

For a teacher not belonging to the medicine faculty to want to refine elixirs, it sounded like a joke to Teacher Feng.

How different would it be from a male wanting to give birth to children?

Teacher Feng wasn’t the only one who felt that way. The students from the medicine faculty also snickered when they heard it.

Not only was Yun Chen useless, his teacher even turned out to be crazy.

It was beyond amusing.

“Okay,” Yun Chen agreed without feeling angry at all.

However, Ye Qingtang noticed Teacher Feng’s sarcasm and disdain for Yun Chen.

“Am I right to say that the elixirs refined by me have nothing to do with the medicine faculty?” Ye Qingtang suddenly asked.

Teacher Feng looked at Ye Qing as though he was looking at an idiot.

“Of course. If you prepare your own herbs, the results certainly have nothing to do with the medicine faculty. With that being said, if you damage anything in the alchemy lab, you’ll have to compensate,” Teacher Feng said.

“Alright.” Ye Qingtang nodded and turned around to speak to Yun Chen. “Take me to your alchemy lab.”

Yun Chen was stunned and paused for a moment before he nodded and left with everyone to head towards the alchemy lab.

Teacher Feng and the youths from the medicine faculty watched them leave, their gazes filled with disdain.

“Nonsense,” Teacher Feng lamented. He wasn’t approving of this Teacher Ye who just disregarded rules. The medicine faculty was different from other faculties and they had a relatively fixed set of teachers. Why did he come and cause trouble even when he didn’t belong to the medicine faculty?

To think that the youth even wanted to refine elixirs...

Lei Yan and the others ran behind Ye Qing and Yun Chen.

Lei Yan couldn’t help but ask, “Boss, are you really going to refine elixirs?”

“What else would I do?” Ye Qingtang replied.

Lei Yan, “...”.

I can’t tell at all. Boss, please stop joking around.
