Chapter 1718: The Cursed Mystic Realm (1)

“The First Domain was used by the True Gods to imprison Heavenly Demons, so that they could never escape. But the Heavenly Demons and humans formed an alliance. Humans, who once worshiped the True Gods, chose to betray them and released all those demons who were trapped inside the First Domain...

“The humans’ betrayal destroyed the First Domain’s imprisonment of the Heavenly Demons. The demons regained their freedom and many True Gods died as they battled against the Heavenly Demons.

“Those dead True Gods bore a deep hatred against the humans for their betrayal. Their godly souls disintegrated to form this mystic realm. This realm was woven out of the curse that the True Gods cast upon the traitorous humans.

“No human who stepped into this realm could leave it alive. They would be trapped forever inside beyond death’s reach. Until their flesh rotted off and their blood ran dry and they turned into bare white bones. Even so, they would remain alive, forever trapped in this realm, unable to die even if they wanted to. They would forever suffer the torment of extreme cold and intense heat.

“The True Gods who died, part of them turned into the Freezing Ice Fields we are standing upon. The other part formed the Scorching Hot Lands.These two areas exist in two extremities. Over here, you will never be able to escape the soul-crushing cold, while in the Scorching Hot Lands, you will have to suffer an unbearably blazing heat.” Yuan Di narrated the history of the mystic realm to Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang was shaken by Yuan Di’s explanation.

Due to the betrayal of the humans, the Heavenly Demons reappeared on earth while the True Gods, who had done so much for the humans, ended up making the biggest sacrifice. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

No one would be able to forgive such a betrayal.

This was originally the humans’ sin...

“The curse starts from the moment a human steps into the mystic realm. The curse is already on you now.” Yuan Di glanced at Ye Qingtang, as if expecting her to give up all hope.

“But you are rather lucky. I heard that the Ice King was stirred up just now. It is already the greatest fortune to be able to escape from him. As a skeleton, you can at least have some freedom. If you were swallowed by the Ice King, you will become part of it. Conscious with your own mind but forever trapped within it. That kind of torment is enough to cause a mental breakdown.” Yuan Di patted Ye Qingtang on the shoulder with its rickety bones.

Anyway, no one would be able to escape from this place.

“Is there really no way to leave this place?” Ye Qingtang asked.

Yuan Di hesitated a moment but didn’t say anything. He just stood up and left.

The rest of the skeletons could not even be bothered to join the conversation. They had been here for so long that they were already used to the endless despair and torment.

Ye Qingtang didn’t understand how the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm had suddenly turned into the cursed mystic realm of the True Gods.

“If you really wish to know how to leave this place, you have to enter that cave and make your inquiry inside.” Qin Zhuo, who had remained silent for a long time, suddenly spoke up. He pointed at a small cave at the side of the canyon.

“Thank you!” Ye Qingtang looked at Qingtang gratefully. But Qin Zhuo just continued to sit there, using the snow to polish his Sword of Destruction.

Wasting no time, Ye Qingtang immediately headed toward the cave.

The entrance to that cave was very small and narrow. Even for someone as petite as Ye Qingtang, she had to bend over to enter.

After walking a few meters, Ye Qingtang saw a wretched-looking skull placed upon an ice platform.
