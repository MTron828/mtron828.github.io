Chapter 1267: Walking on Thin Ice (2)

Once Ye Qingtang returned to the Temple of Shadows, she headed back to her own living quarters.

The number of frights that she suffered from the two days of being in the Temple of Shadows was more than what she experienced in the past few years.

It felt like walking on thin ice, like her life was hanging on a bare thread.

After Ye Qingtang returned to her living quarters, the Hall Master who went to the Luo Residence with Ye Qingtang went to meet Ming Wang.

Ming Wang was discussing some matters with a few tribe leaders and immediately called the Hall Master in for a report after hearing that the Hall Master was back.

“Is the Holy Lord back?” Ming Wang asked in a low voice without looking up.

“Yes,” replied the Hall Master.

Ming Wang looked up slightly and took a look at the Hall Master expressionlessly. “The Luo Residence must have been rather lively today.”

The Demon Tribe Leader from aside heard a hidden meaning in Ming Wang’s words and asked immediately, “Ming Wang, do you know something about the Luo Family’s birthday banquet? Otherwise, given your personality, why would you let the Holy Lord go there?”

Just based on the Luo Family’s skills itself, the Luo Family did not deserve their Holy Lord to head there personally.

Ming Wang’s eyes had an aloof expression. “Luo Qufeng obtained a fragmented scroll of a cultivation technique previously and has been secretly cultivating it over the past years. This cultivation technique can absorb other people’s cultivation base and use it themselves. He has been cultivating it for thousands of years, and it should be about done. The birthday celebration this year was publicized so widely, and it should be because they conspired something. How would the Luo Residence not be lively then?”

The tribe leaders immediately understood Ming Wang’s intentions after what Ming Wang said.

“You knew it long ago? So… you sent the Holy Lord there intentionally to use this opportunity to test her identity?”

Ming Wang’s expression was the same as before. “I knew it long ago? What do I know? I am not a member of the Luo Family and have no interest in what they want to do.”

Although that was what Ming Wang said, the tribe leaders present were not fools and naturally understood what Ming Wang meant.

“Were there any interesting incidents during the birthday celebration?” Ming Wang turned to look at the Hall Master and asked.

The Hall Master immediately narrated the events to Ming Wang in full detail.

There was a subtle change in Ming Wang’s expression.

“You said that… Luo Qufeng’s cultivation base was absorbed by the Holy Lord’s Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline?”

“Yes.” The Hall Master nodded and said subsequently. “But according to my observation, it was not the Holy Lord who actively absorbed it, and it seemed more like the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline automatically absorbed Luo Qufeng’s powers.

“She did not absorb it actively…” Tilting his head slightly, Ming Wang supported his head with one hand while gently tapping a chair with the other.

“I got it. You can leave first.”

“Noted.” The Hall Master received his order and retreated immediately.

The moment the Hall Master left, the other tribe leaders spoke.

“Ming Wang, although the Holy Lord has not really displayed her skills before us, we cannot be certain that she really possesses the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline. However, it is indeed fishy that the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline passively absorbed the cultivation base of others. Given the Holy Lord’s skills, why is there a need for this? Furthermore, it was not instructed by her either…” The tribe leaders grew increasingly suspicious.

“Although that human did not tamper with the Nine Souls Ring, it does not say much either as she could have tempered with it herself if she intended to.” The Goblin Tribal Leader commented subsequently. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The more they observed the Holy Lord, the more suspicious they became. However, her actions were extremely similar to that of the Holy Lord’s, and they could not distinguish the difference at a moment.

“If anyone has any thoughts, you may just say it,” Ming Wang said immediately.

“We don’t have many thoughts, but our objective is the same. No one can impersonate the Holy Lord, and anyone who dares to do so will be a sinner for eternity,” the Demon Tribe Leader said coldly.

Ming Wang narrowed his eyes slightly. His pitch-black eyes were filled with an eerie iciness.

“Of course, if anyone impersonates the Holy Lord, I will let them know what the cruelest torture in this world tastes like…”

“This promise of yours is sufficient.” The few tribe leaders exchanged a look and made a decision in their hearts immediately.
