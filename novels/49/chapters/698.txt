Chapter 699: Bliss Forging Workshop (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang arrived at a less crowded place in the black market after walking through the bustling streets. This area was full of forging workshops that sold weapons.

Among the forging workshops, there was a simple-looking stall that stood out. There was an old plaque hanging on top of the forging workshop. The word “bliss” was engraved on it.

Though it was the least eye-catching workshop on the street, there was a crowd of people outside the door. These people were dressed in expensive clothes and did not seem to be normal citizens. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Du Sheng, please. Just sell me one sword.” In the small stall, a man who was well-dressed was chatting with a young man around sixteen or seventeen.

The young man was handsome but dressed in normal clothes. However, the man who was asking for a sword was still begging him constantly.

“Sorry, but Master said that he is not in a good mood today, and he does not want to sell any sword,” the young man Du Sheng said and sighed.

“Please! I have prepared all the things that the Master will like. Just help me to convince him and ask him to sell one sword to me. Any sword will do.”

“Yes yes. Just give me any random sword at any price. Please, just sell one to us.”

“A half-completed product will do as well!”

A group of well-dressed men were begging Du Sheng.

The stall was completely different from other forging workshops. Du Sheng could only shake his head under so many requests.

“Please go back, everyone. We will not sell any sword today.”

The workers from other forging workshops all wished to pull those clients to their stalls when the Bliss Forging Workshop chased away their businesses.

Ye Qingtang was used to the scene.

Though the Bliss Forging Workshop was small, it had the most business. It was harder than anything to purchase a sword from the Bliss Forging Workshop. It all depended on the shop owner’s mood to sell a sword no matter what the buyer’s identity was or how much he was willing to pay.

Ye Qingtang had come to the place many times with her Senior Brother in her previous life under the name of their Master. However, no matter how much effort they spent, the shop owner still did not agree to forge a weapon for her Master. Eventually, her Master had to come to this place personally and convinced the owner after a few days with a great price paid.

The owner of the Bliss Forging Workshop was different from others. As the rumors said, he was a famous blacksmith on the past. All weapons that he forged were divine weapons. However, the person had a weird temper and chose to hide in the black market of the Nine Nights Dynasty. He rarely met with people.

In her previous life, the method of forging weapons with Spirit Crystals was created by him after a few years.

The group of people did not manage to purchase any swords even though they spent much effort in trying to convince the workers. They could only stare at the few weapons left hanging in the stall.

Ye Qingtang walked into the small forging workshop. Her gaze did not change when she saw the poor decorations of the stall. Her sight passed the weapons and landed on Du Sheng, who was cleaning a sword.

“Hi, I would like to see Master Du,” Ye Qingtang said straight away.

Du Sheng lifted his head and was slightly stunned when he saw the pretty young man in front of him.

The other customers in the stall all turned around to see the origin of the voice.
