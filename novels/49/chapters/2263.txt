Chapter 2264: Leaving (1)

“Is that… the fiendcelestial’s skeleton?” Lei Yan swallowed hard.

That skeleton was colossal. If one were to guess, it was at least a hundred meters in height.

The mere sight of it chilled them to the bone.

Only the chest area was exposed. The bottom half was buried beneath the treasure piles while the head was swallowed by the darkness of the endlessly high ceiling.

“Lucky we listened to Boss and didn’t take anything. If this is really the skeleton of the fiendcelestial, even though it’s already dead, we will probably die horrible deaths if we plunder its treasures right in front of its skeleton.”

As Ye Qingtang looked at its curved ribs, she saw it was like a huge cover encasing countless treasures. If one were to look closely, they could see faint green lights sparkling amongst the bones.

Ye Qingtang led the group toward that colossal skeleton. Lei Yan and the others hesitated.

“Boss, should we circle around? We shouldn’t disturb the fiendcelestial…” Lei Yan asked timidly.

This godforsaken place. Even the statues required peace and quiet. Who knew if this skeleton was the fiendcelestial. The fiendcelestial would definitely be even more domineering than those evil demon statues.

“We cannot circle around it.”

The teenagers exchanged glances. While they had no idea why Ye Qing was so stubborn, they didn’t dare to disobey. So they only followed obediently behind him.

Boss had more world experience than them. Just follow Boss…

You couldn’t go wrong with that.

There was no way Ye Qingtang would circle around. The sight of that skeleton reminded her of the key to leaving the fiendcelestial’s tomb.

However…

She had to confirm if the rumors were true.

“There’s a tree there!” Yun Chen suddenly saw a large, green tree growing right within the massive ribcage.

It was a towering tree with expansive branches spreading all across the inside of the ribcage as if it was an internal organ system.

The sight of that vibrant green tree amongst the pile of sparkling treasures looked exceptionally eye-catching. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Looks like fruits are growing upon that tree.” Qin Feng’s brows furrowed slightly.

Everyone turned toward the tree. Hidden amongst the thick leaves were indeed multiple glowing spots.

As they approached the tree, several people gasped.

What kind of fruit was that?

They were clearly high-level treasures! If those treasures on the ground were enough to make one shriek in delight, then those upon that tree were enough to make one completely stupefied on the spot.

Every single fruit on that tree was a divine-level artifact. Any one of them was enough to shock the entire Second Domain. With so many divine-level artifacts hidden amongst the tree leaves radiating with a vibrant green glow, it only served to accentuate the allure of those treasures.

Even with Ye Qing’s warning, the sight of those artifacts had the group swallowing hard to suppress their temptation.

Second Domain?

If they could get their hands on those treasures, they could even take over the Third Domain!

Just as everyone was feeling very moved, Ye Qingtang’s attention was attracted by a black fruit on that tree.

The fruit was about the size of a fist and pitch-black. Hidden amongst the leaves and all the other dazzling divine artifacts, it was very easy to overlook that dim, black fruit.
