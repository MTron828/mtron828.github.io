Chapter 1248: Every Debt Has Its Debtor (1)

Ye Qingtang’s heart turned cold when she saw the Grand Elder of the Yunying Sect’s bone-chilling determination to kill her.

The Grand Elder was so powerful he could probably reduce her to minced meat with just one finger.

However…

Ye Qingtang forced down the chill in her heart. She glanced at the Grand Elder of the Yunying Sect from the corner of her eye and laughed softly. “The Yun Family? I’m so sorry… I can’t remember such a clan at all.”

How could the Holy Lord of Shadows, who was once supreme in this mainland, possibly remember every one of the millions of clans she had slaughtered?

Sorry, Grand Elder of the Yunying Sect. She did not wish to say this either…

But…

Dozens of eyes from the Temple of Shadows were staring at her.

The Grand Elder of the Yunying Sect glared at Ye Qingtang. She had taken thousands of lives in his Yun Clan, and now she had no recollection of it at all!

“Whether or you remember them or not, I will definitely avenge my clansmen today!” The Grand Elder of the Yunying Sect bellowed with rage. The Yunying Sect members behind him immediately advanced a step and were about to draw their swords.

The commotion immediately drew the attention of all the guests who were present.

At that moment, everyone’s gaze converged on them.

They looked at the deep hatred of the usually suave Grand Elder of the Yunying Sect, then looked at the “Holy Lord of Shadows”, who was smiling sweetly and unconcernedly. Everyone’s emotions were in turmoil.

The Yunying Sect’s power was certainly uncommon, and the Grand Elder’s abilities were sufficient to make him one of the top powerful cultivators.

However…

The object of his vengeance was the Holy Lord of Shadows, who used to be the most powerful cultivator in the entire mainland.

“Is the Grand Elder of the Yunying Sect crazy? Is he really going to indiscriminately fight the Holy Lord of Shadows?”

“His entire clan was slaughtered before his eyes. Anyone else would have collapsed, but all these years, the Grand Elder of the Yunying Sect forced himself to survive to avenge his clansmen. I hear that he spent thousands of years training diligently. This time, he might be planning to fight the Holy Lord of Shadows to death.”

Ye Qingtang almost collapsed inwardly when she saw the Yunying Sect Grand Elder’s murderous intent.

She could clearly sense that the Grand Elder of the Yunying Sect was determined to avenge his clansmen. He would even sacrifice his life to do so.

However…

She was not even the Holy Lord of Shadows. How could she possibly be a match for the Grand Elder of the Yunying Sect?

Ye Qingtang lifted her eyes slightly. Her expression did not change at all when faced with the murderous intentions of the Grand Elder of the Yunying Sect. She raised her head a little, and the smile lurking in the corner of her mouth deepened slightly.

“Who are you to seek vengeance on me?”

How hateful she was!

Ye Qingtang grieved inwardly, but she maintained her lofty expression as if the Grand Elder of the Yunying Sect was of no consequence to her. She flicked her eyes away and said, “Today is Luo Qufeng’s birthday banquet. I am not interested in spoiling someone’s joyous occasion.”

Ye Qingtang paused and swept a cold look at the Grand Elder of the Yunying Sect.

“You are not a worthy opponent.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Not a worthy opponent! Today, I will make you pay for the lives of my entire clan!” The Grand Elder of the Yunying Sect was prepared for indiscriminate destruction, and he struck out with a thunderous blow.

A huge, crimson dragon instantly blasted out from the Grand Elder of the Yunying Sect’s palm and roared towards Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang already sensed the crimson dragon roaring towards her with an apocalyptic force. Death seemed imminent.
