Chapter 801 Emperor Dowager (2)

“It’s her again… You have been thinking of her for more than a decade. Isn’t it enough? Did she even appear in the past decade? If not for me… who else would look after you all the time?” The Emperor Dowager sneered and took a deep breath to suppress her anger. She put down the food in her hand onto the table.

“Today, you beat your own child for her daughter. Are you going to give the entire Nine Nights Dynasty to her daughter after a few years then?!”

“Shut up…” the Grand Emperor frowned.

Ye Qingtang did not say anything at the side. However, she sensed something from the conversations.

According to the rumors, the Grand Emperor had married the Empress when he was enthroned. Ye Qingtang’s mother came to the Nine Nights Dynasty and assisted the Grand Emperor to secure his position.

It seemed that the Grand Emperor did not only feel gracious and admiring towards her mother…

The Grand Emperor did not adore any other woman in his life due to that special feeling. That was why he only had one Empress that he married earlier.

The Emperor Dowager must have sensed all these and was reconciled to accept the truth.

Ye Qingtang’s sight landed on the food that the Emperor Dowager brought.

“I was saying nonsense? All these years when you lay on the bed, you did not care for your son at all but sent people to look for her daughter. You think that I don’t know about that? As his father, your care towards him is even less than the premier Qin Long. Do you even feel sorry for us!” The Emperor Dowager released her anger at once.

“How dare you to mention Qin Long? If not because of him, how would the Nine Nights Dynasty end up like this now!” The Grand Emperor raged. His body that had just slightly recovered previously was shivering in anger.

The Emperor Dowager stared at the Grand Emperor. Her eyes were cold. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Suddenly…

“Emperor Dowager, it seems that you like Qin Long?” Ye Qingtang said slowly.

The Emperor Dowager frowned slightly and took a glimpse at Ye Qingtang. “How dare you to speak here, rabble.”

Ye Qingtang glanced at the Emperor Dowager and said, “It’s not your call to make whether I’m able to speak here. Aren’t you the one who is stepping over the line when the Grand Emperor is here?”

The Emperor Dowager’s eyes sparkled. The Grand Emperor’s health was deteriorating every day. He did not even have the strength to get off the bed. She was in control of the whole palace, and she treated the Grand Emperor as a useless person.

Ye Qingtang waited for the Emperor Dowager’s reaction and said, “It seems like you are in good relations with Qin Long. If not, why would you poison the Grand Emperor’s food for him?”

Everyone in the bedroom was shocked after Ye Qingtang finished her words.

“How dare you to frame me! Men, drag this rabble down!” The Emperor Dowager stared at Ye Qingtang.

A few guards who followed her here dashed into the bedroom after the Emperor Dowager commanded.

“Do you think I’m a dead person here? How dare you touch her!” The Grand Emperor struggled to sit up.

The guards were stunned and did not dare to step forward.

“You were saying that… it’s the Emperor Dowager who poisoned me in my food?” The Grand Emperor looked towards Ye Qingtang in disbelief.

“Grand Emperor, don’t listen to this rabble’s nonsense. Why would I poison you?” The Emperor Dowager said coldly.

Ye Qingtang took a bowl of porridge from the table and took a sniff.

“The rotting bone powder does not have any smell or color. Even a silver needle cannot detect its presence. I don’t know how many good people have died under the Qin family because of this powder. I’m very curious. Did the Emperor Dowager get the rotting bone powder from Qin Long?”
