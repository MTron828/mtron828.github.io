“Oh… Who is the disciple that you mentioned?” The Xuanling Sect Master smiled.

“Too many to be counted,” the Yunxiao Sect warden said.

“That’s rare. We caught a spy not long ago named Fu Lingtian. He has been killed by us. There was one more person called Ning Luo and was saved by two of the Yunxiao Sect disciples. Were you talking about them?” the Xuanling Sect Master said.

“Humph! Don’t talk so much. Your sect has committed too many sins. You better open the protection array and hand over one disciple.” The Yunxiao Sect warden shouted coldly. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Oh? Which disciple do you want?” The Xuanling Sect Master still smiled and asked.

“Ye Qingtang!”

“What a joke! Why would I hand over my sect’s disciple to you?!” the Xuanling Sect Master said coldly.

“Ye Qingtang of your sect has committed many crimes. She killed my sect master’s disciple Yue Tiancheng and elder’s disciple Li Jiwu. She even hurt ten of my sect disciples,” the Yunxiao Sect warden said.

Everyone of the Xuanling Sect was stunned after his words. Qin Huan’s and Zhu Changge’s faces were full of surprise.

“What joke is this?”

“They want to frame Junior Sister Ye?!”

“Humph, what a joke! Yue Tiancheng and Li Jiwu both possessed the Martial Qi Level Three ability. How could Junior Sister Ye be able to kill them?!”

Xuanling Sect’s disciples shouted in rage.

Qin Huan and Zhu Changge stared at each other in confusion.

They had witnessed Ye Qingtang’s terrifying fighting ability. They could believe that Ye Qingtang managed to kill Yue Tiancheng and Li Jiwu.

However, no one could confirm whether what the Yunxiao Sect warden said was the truth.

Everyone knew clearly that whether or not Ye Qingtang killed any Yunxiao Sect’s disciples, it was just an excuse. The Yunxiao Sect would not let go of the Xuanling Sect. It was destined that the Yunxiao Sect wanted to kill everyone in the Xuanling Sect the day they discovered Yunxiao Sect’s secrets.

Ye Qingtang was just an excuse.

Even if the Xuanling Sect handed over Ye Qingtang, the Yunxiao Sect would not stop killing the rest as well.

“Xuanling Sect, we’ll give you fifteen minutes to hand over Ye Qingtang. Time starts now!” one of the Yunxiao Sect’s elders said coldly.

“It’s not necessary. If Ye Qingtang really killed your sect’s disciples, I will say that’s an excellent kill!” The Xuanling Sect Master’s eyes were cold, and he waved his hand.

Everyone was silent after he finished his sentences.

“Excellent kill!”

Soon, the Xuanling Sect disciples broke the silence and shouted together.

“Excellent kill!”

“Excellent kill!”

“Excellent kill!”

Thousands of voices were like deafening thunder that exploded in the sky

It was the truth that the Yunxiao Sect wanted to kill everyone in the Xuanling Sect. The fight was inevitable, and that made the Yunxiao Sect the enemy. Was it not excellent that Ye Qingtang killed the enemy sect’s disciples?

“You… deserve to be dead.”

Li Chenfeng, who sat on top of the Yunxiao Sect’s divine beast, said his first few words.

“You… deserve to be dead.”

“You… deserve to be dead.”

“You… deserve to be dead.”

The few hundreds of Yunxiao Sect’s inner sect disciples shouted together.

“Today will be the fall of Xuanling Sect,” an elder of the Yunxiao Sect said, and a cold glint shone in his eyes.

The sect master said that they must catch Ye Qingtang today no matter what happened. If not because of that, they would not have wasted so much time to talk to the Xuanling Sect.
