Chapter 2409: Accident (3)

Outside the Wailing Well, Wen Qi watched the wretched state of Lu Yuanxiang’s team with helplessness and sorrow.

Lu Yuanxiang was one of the most outstanding and promising teachers in the Netherworld Academy. Both Wen Qi and Wu Fengling held him in high regard. Wen Qi never expected Lu Yuanxiang to fail to endure to the end of the competition.

“What the hell was that monster? Did you guys get a clear look?” Wen Qi turned toward the others in the crowd.

The spectators from the various academies all looked very grim and solemn.

“There shouldn’t be any creatures which are above the Emperor level in this team competition.”

“Shouldn’t? Didn’t you all see what happened just now?” Wen Qi’s voice was frosty.

The team competition would be challenging but it would not be so far beyond the limits of the competitors.

If push came to shove, they might be able to accept the presence of an Emperor level monster. But above the Emperor level… even the academy leaders at present would not be able to defend themselves against something like that, not to mention those in the competition.

After all, this competition was not about sending these elite students to their death. There would be a limit on the difficulty level.

“We don’t know much about the Wailing Well. We need to ask people from Universe City.” The Vice-President of the Heaven Dome Academy also looked grim. The teams from his school had all performed very well over the past few days but if they encountered a monster like that…

He didn’t even dare to think about the outcome.

It should be pointed out that all the students in this team competition were the top talents of their academies. They were extremely precious to their schools. The family clans behind these elite students alone were a formidable presence.

If there were multiple deaths and serious injuries, it would create a major uproar.

“I will go and ask.” Luo Sheng spoke up.

Wen Qi nodded.

The other academies were also fearful. They secretly rejoiced that it was not their own teams who encountered that monster. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“It is still not too late now. Lu Yuanxiang is a smart man and he can tell when things have become too serious. They will be safe as long as they leave the Wailing Well,” one of the teachers comforted him.

But the rest of them were still worried. Who knew where that monster was hiding now? What could they do if the other teams encountered it?

Stationed on the outside, they were helpless. While they could see everything that happened to the teams in the Wailing Well, but they could not communicate with them.

They could not even inform the other teams of this new development.

Wen Qi looked very upset, but he knew that there was no other way. He instructed his men to prepare medical treatment for Lu Yuanxiang’s team before continuing to watch the screen in the big hall.

He heaved a sigh of relief when he saw Lu Yuanxiang instruct his student to crush the teleportation talisman.

But before he fully exhaled, something unexpected happened!

…

The moment the teleportation talisman was crushed, Lu Yuanxiang’s team waited to be transported out of the Wailing Well.

Finally, they would be leaving this terrifying place.

They were reluctant but were already resigned to their fate.

However…

Even after the talisman was completely crushed, the team remained on the same spot in the Wailing Well.

“What’s going on?” Lu Yuanxiang was shocked.

The teenager who crushed the talisman was also stunned. He looked at the crushed talisman in his hand, his eyes filled with confusion.

“I… I don’t know. I have already crushed it. Why… why are we still here?”
