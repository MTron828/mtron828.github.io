As soon as she alighted from the carriage, Ye Qingtang was shocked by the extremely thick demonic aura permeating the place. If her skill level was any lower, she would probably be engulfed by the energy and end up losing her mind and perhaps even losing her life.

“Can Miss Ye withstand the demonic energy here?”

Seeing that Ye Qingtang was not acting strangely, the white-haired elder stared at her meaningfully.

Ye Qingtang nodded slightly and said, “Senior, although the demonic aura here is thick, it does not affect me.”

“Hmm, looks like Miss Ye is better than I imagined,” the white-haired elder said thoughtfully.

Ye Qingtang did not know what the white-haired elder meant and did not take it to heart.

After a while, the other members of the Dragon Emperor Clan who had traveled with them walked over. The middle-aged man in the lead looked at Ye Qingtang and said, “Miss Ye, your friend is unable to endure the aura here. I gave him a medicinal pill and he will be fine after it takes effect. I have already sent him to the guest room to rest. Miss Ye, do not worry.”

Ye Qingtang looked at the middle-aged man and nodded. “Thank you, Senior.”

“By the way, is this Miss Ye’s first time in the Dragon Emperor Clan?” The middle-aged man asked with a smile. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Of course it’s my first time. In the past, I have only heard of the great name of the Dragon Emperor Clan. I never expected to be lucky enough to visit the Dragon Emperor Clan in my lifetime. It seems like a dream.” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“Yes, I need to remind Miss Ye of a few points. As a guest in the Dragon Emperor Clan, you must remember not to wander around on your own or get into conflict with anyone here. Otherwise, your life might be in danger,” the middle-aged man told Ye Qingtang in a serious tone.

In fact, there was no need for the middle-aged man to remind her. She would not wander around on her own. As for fighting with someone from the Dragon Emperor Clan, that was even more improbable. It would be no different from committing suicide.

Ye Qingtang knew that the Dragon Emperor Clan cultivated in the Way of the Evil Deity and was considered a true evil clan. Fighting with a powerful person who cultivated in demonic ways would be equivalent to seeking death. Even the younger generations of the Dragon Emperor Clan were not people that she could compare with.

The middle-aged man continued to explain things to her, and Ye Qingtang was able to gather a basic understanding of the Dragon Emperor Clan.

The hierarchy of the Dragon Emperor Clan was extremely strict, mainly determined by one’s bloodline. The bloodline with the most respected status as the direct bloodline, followed by the different branches who shared a common ancestor.

In the Dragon Emperor Clan, there were very few with a direct bloodline, and none of them were to be trifled with.

Ye Qingtang had no intention of causing trouble at all. She felt that the middle-aged man might be over-anxious. In the current situation, she was just an insignificant outsider and could not even be considered a guest. In addition, her skills were also very ordinary. Even if she died in the Dragon Emperor Clan, no one would pay her any attention.

“Senior, don’t worry. I understand the rules… I have to ask you, when can I leave?” Ye Qingtang looked at the middle-aged man and asked softly.

On the surface, Ye Qingtang might be a guest of the Dragon Emperor Clan who had been invited by the white-haired elder. However, she knew very well what her actual situation was.. It would not be an exaggeration to call her a prisoner.
