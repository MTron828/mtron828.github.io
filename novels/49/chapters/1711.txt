Chapter 1712: Alive or Dead (1)

But Ye Qingtang didn’t dare drag this on any further, and started circulating the spirit energy within her body immediately.

Almost at once, her body started warming up, brushing off the severe chill. Even though she was still cold, it was at least bearable for a while.

Jiang Shaobai and Ye Qingtang weren’t the only ones who had thought of this idea, and the others slowly caught on and wasted no time circulating their spirit energy.

Once they had warmed up slightly, they could finally take a good look at their surroundings.

Under the cover of ice and snow, the entire place was covered with a blanket of white. Everywhere they looked, the stark white seemed to penetrate as far as the eye could seeーthe trees, plants, mountains and ground were all carved from ice. They seemed to gleam coldly, not tainted by any other tone of colour.

At the same time the wind roared at them, the bone-chilling cold seemingly trying to rob them of the warmth they needed so desperately to stay alive.

“What’s that?” Sang Feiyu broke out of his trance as he noticed something in the glacier beneath their feet. There was a dense gray spot which they rushed towards.

As they approached it, goosebumps crawled over their limbs and a shiver ran down their spines.

Corpses. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Under the glacier was a mountain of corpses.

In this cold environment, the corpses had all maintained the state they were in before they died. They had not rotted at all and looked as though they were still alive.

Under their feet, the countless corpses were strewn in all directions. Among the intact corpses were broken arms and legs as well, mangled and twisted in an everlasting grave.

“What’s... happening here?” Sang Feiyu’s face was red. How could there be so many corpses in the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm? And how did they end up being frozen within the glacier?

“Domain Monarch Founder...” Wu Xiao suddenly exclaimed as he knelt down on the ground. There was a severed head in the glacier.

The head lay alone in the glacier and seemed to have some resemblance to Wu Xiao.

“Wu Xiao, you recognize that hea-that man?” Zhan Rao asked.

Wu Xiao nodded. That’s the Domain Monarch Founder of the Wu family vanished mysteriously three thousand years ago... but... why is he here?”

Everyone was stunned as well.

They were suddenly reminded of a supreme master from the Wu family who had appeared three thousand years ago. He had been one of the most powerful beings in the mainland. Everyone had thought that the Wu family was going to rise greatly before he vanished suddenly.

“Wu Xiao, are you sure you’re not mistaken? You’re sure it’s Wu Chou from your family?” Zhan Rao felt all of his hair stand on end. Elder Wu Chou from the Wu family had never participated in the Martial Arts Championship, so why was his corpse in the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm?

Wu Xiao shook his head. “I’m not mistaken. I’ve seen his photo and there’s no way I’m wrong.”

Wu Xiao’s words sent chills down everyone’s spine. This mystic realm was getting stranger and stranger.

It wasn’t just Wu Chou. They soon noticed many other legendary people who had once taken the mainland by storm, yet had vanished when they were at their peak. Many people had said that they had gone to the second realm, but they were all frozen within the glacier now.

There were so many powerful men here, people stronger than the ten of them. But they had all met their demise here mysteriously, even when none of them had ever heard of them entering the mystic realm before.

Wu Xiao was still in mourning when the eyes of the Elder beneath his feet suddenly moved.
