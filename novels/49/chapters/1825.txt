Chapter 1826: Unexpected Surprise (1)

Ye Qingtang had never been able to control the Devouring Bloodline. Who would have expected it to merge with her black flames.

It couldn’t be....Was this because of the Deity Ocean?

But Ye Qingtang had no time to spend thinking about this. She looked at her black flames devouring the Fire Demons, feeling herself getting stronger as the demons were slowly consumed.

Even though her strength was not growing fast, it was already considered a big leap for a Heavenly Venerate.

This devouring effect not only allowed her to escape from danger but also turn the Fire Demons’ fire into something that she could absorb, increasing her own strength with comparative ease.

Ye Qingtang’s celebrated in her heart but did not dare let down her guard yet. As her black flames devoured the Fire Demons’ fire, she saw the three mutant Fire Demon gradually shrink.

“The Fire Demons rely on the fire as their life force. You’re depriving them of their power as you absorb their fire and are bleeding them dry!” Now that the situation was looking more hopeful, Little White Tiger perked up and roared loudly.

Ye Qingtang’s heart lifted as an idea popped into her head. Even though she couldn’t hope to defeat the three mutant Fire Demons, it would still be good for her to let her black flames slowly sap away their energy.

But in the blink of an eye, the five meter Fire Demons had shrunk down to only three meters in height. The flames they were spitting out of their mouth stopped suddenly as well.

“Have they used up all their power?” Ye Qingtang’s heart was overjoyed.

But before she could even express her joy, she noticed the three mutant Fire Demons absorbing the flames that were scorching the earth and falling from the sky. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The Fire Demon absorbed the flames rapidly and grew to twice their height right in front of their eyes.

Like that, they grew back to five meters in a split second.

Ye Qingtang, “...”

What the hell was that?

The tiny sliver of hope she had just discovered was smashed into smithereens.

Originally she had intended to finish off the three mutant Fire Demons with her black flames but had never thought that they would absorb the flames around themselves and grow back to their original size.

The hope in her turned to despair as she looked at the flames covering the earth and the fire raining down on them.

How long was it going to take to devour all of this?

As long as the rain of fire continued, the three mutant Fire Demons would be able to replenish their energy infinitely. Although her black flames had gained the ability to devour her enemies, she was going to die if she didn’t pay heed to the situation.

Even though she wanted to curse this land a thousand times, the only thing she could do now was look out for herself. It was already considered lucky that she got stronger as the black flames devoured everything, or she would have already been dead.

However, just as Ye Qingtang was about to lose all hope, the red clouds in the sky dispersed and the rain of fire slowly subsided.

“The Cursed True God’s song has already stopped for some time now, so the fire rain should be diminishing. We should use this opportunity to destroy them!” Little White Tiger roared as it jumped out of Ye Qingtang’s arms. With its mane still bald and patchy in some areas, it sprayed white flames at the three mutant Fire Demons.
