Chapter 1524 Ten Thousand Years 3

“Wait!” Fu Xu’s complexion changed. Seeing that Ye Qingtang wanted to leave, he instantly replied. “If you don’t believe us, I’ll give you one item right now. You can take a look first before deciding.”

Only then did Ye Qingtang stop in her tracks.

The little white tiger was very speechless.

Ye Qingtang truly perfected the skill of profiting from someone’s misfortune now...

Ye Qingtang giggled on the inside but kept a despising look on the outside.

Helpless, Fu Xu retrieved a copper ball from his space ring and tossed it out of the boundary.

Living things would not be able to pass through this boundary, but non-living things could.

Ye Qingtang picked up that copper ball and placed it before her eyes.

“You’re tricking me with this lousy copper ball?” Ye Qingtang had a disdainful expression.

Fu Xu almost fainted from anger.

“This is the Xuanming Ball and can absorb the essence in the surroundings. If you carry this item with you, it will also absorb the essence of the world when you cultivate, and the speed of cultivation can be multiplied if you cultivate with it in your palm.

Xuanming Ball?

Ye Qingtang really did hear of such a Dharma treasure in her previous life. This was a Dharma treasure that only existed in the Second Domain, and it was a superior cultivation item that was extremely rare. However, Ye Qingtang had only heard of it in her previous life and had not seen it before.

Fu Xu was indeed a big shot in the Second Domain—any random Dharma treasure he tossed out was a rare superior item. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Ye Qingtang laughed on the inside but kept an unmoved expression.

“I am being hunted down for my life right now. Making it out alive is already an issue for me. Even if you give me this cultivation item, I can’t use it right now.”

Overwhelming hate.

Fu Xu was furious to death.

Emperor Yan could also tell that it was not time for him to put on airs. He immediately waved his hand and took out a cloak from his space ring before tossing it to Ye Qingtang.

“Don’t you just need a way to avoid being killed by others? This is an invisibility cloak. As long as you wear it, no one can sense your breath unless their cultivation realm is two entire realms higher than yours. This is enough to protect your life already, right?”

Ye Qingtang could not help but chuckle internally as she picked up that cloak.

The treasures that these big shots took out were truly getting rarer and rarer.

“How do I know if what you said is real or not? There’s no one else here. How do I know if others can sense my presence when I wear this thing?” Disbelief filled Ye Qingtang’s face.

Emperor Yan gritted his teeth in anger.

“Darn girl. If I wasn’t trapped in here, I wouldn’t have time to talk so much bullshit with you. You...”

“You think I’m willing to be nosy with your matters? Since you all are not interested, I’ll take my leave first in case I get into unnecessary trouble.” Then, Ye Qingtang wanted to leave again.

But how could Emperor Yan and the rest be willing to let her leave?

Then, the other powerful figures who did not speak much took out plenty of treasures from their space rings and successively tossed it to Ye Qingtang outside the boundary without hesitation.

Items were dead already, but humans were alive. All these treasures were useless if they died here.

The concealed smile in Ye Qingtang’s eyes deepened at the sight of the pile of treasures before her.

Seeing that it was about enough, Ye Qingtang frowned and said rather reluctantly, “Forget it. Seeing that you all are pitiful, I’ll help out this one time.” As she spoke in a tone as if she suffered a huge loss, she swept all the Dharma treasures on the floor into her space ring with a look of contempt.

Yet, any one of those treasures could drive the people in this mainland insane.
