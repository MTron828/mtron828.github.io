Chapter 2488: Long Time No See, Blood Moon Elder (6)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Soon, Ye Qingtang followed the Yongle Tribe General to a cellar within the Yongle Tribe territory. This cellar was specially used by the Yongle Tribe General to keep his human skins and maintain a rather dry temperature.

Many human skins were hanging on the walls of the cellar. There were both men and women, mostly youths. They looked like they were just asleep. If she didn’t know any better, Ye Qingtang would definitely not believe that these men and women, who looked completely unharmed, were just human skins.

Ye Qingtang sighed in her heart. She was no great savior. She could not even protect herself, let alone change the demon tribes and save anyone.

Very quickly, Ye Qingtang went forward and examined these vessels up close. She even touched them.

A moment later, Ye Qingtang’s expression relaxed somewhat.

These vessels did not belong to real humans.

At the very least, they were much weaker than the humans in the outside world. They were more like the manifestation of some sort of power.

Ye Qingtang always had a suspicion lingering in her mind.

This realm didn’t truly exist. It was only a place within the Deity Ocean. Everything within the Deity Ocean originated from the evolution of the Deity Ocean’s power. If so, were the humans within the Deity Ocean truly human…?

Were the demons in the Deity Ocean truly demons?

Or could it be that all of this was merely the imagination of the past master of the Deity Ocean?

Now, this Deity Ocean had already become an object in her body and was nurtured by Ye Qingtang’s dantian. If she could completely control the Deity Ocean one day, what changes would there be?

“Ancestor?”

Seeing that Ye Qingtang was deep in thought, the Yongle Tribe General could not help but call her in a soft voice. Ye Qingtang immediately snapped out of her trance and started sizing up the vessels.

“This won’t do… too handsome. It doesn’t match.”

“Not that either. Still too handsome…”

Ye Qingtang realized that the vessels collected by the Yongle Tribe General were extremely beautiful people.

According to Ye Qingtang’s thinking, based on the Blood Moon Elder’s personality and style of doing things, he definitely would not like this type of body. An older and uglier body would suit his preferences better.

After perusing the bodies for a long time, Ye Qingtang still did not find a suitable vessel.

Finally, Ye Qingtang’s gaze landed on a vessel at the corner. It was a middle-aged man with a mole on the left side of his face. His face looked a little fierce and his aura was not weak.

After pondering for a moment, Ye Qingtang pointed at the middle-aged man and said, “This one then.”

“This?”

The Yongle Tribe General was stunned and in disbelief.

This vessel was his least favorite. He had been preparing to throw it out of the cellar recently. Who would have thought that the Ancestor would choose this one…

“Ancestor, are you sure?” The Yongle Tribe General asked. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“I’m certain. This one.” Ye Qingtang nodded slightly. She believed that the Blood Moon Elder would be satisfied with this.

“Ancestor, you have very unique tastes. This is also my favorite vessel. Look, his face is rugged and seems to have a strong aura and force. His skin is rough and seems to be full of strength. It is a rare top-grade item. The mole on his face is also very unique.” The Yongle Tribe General said to Ye Qingtang after a moment of silence.

Ye Qingtang smiled. “That’s right, I think so too. This will do.”

“Alright…”

The Yongle Tribe General took a few steps forward and swiftly removed the vessel.
