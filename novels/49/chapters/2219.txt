Chapter 2220: Night Soul Beast (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

After confirming that everyone’s ears were covered, the corners of Ye Qingtang’s lips suddenly lifted in a slight smile. She gazed at the shrinking Night Soul Beast.

“Night Soul Beast, born from grievances, surviving by swallowing souls, the source of your power is fear. But now... you don’t seem to have any fear to swallow.”

Ye Qingtang’s voice was unhurried and calm.

The Night Soul Beast’s originally massive body had now shrunk into human height. And it was continuing to shrink.

The Night Soul Beast was shocked.

It had never met a human like this.

She was not afraid of it at all?!

Impossible.

And Ye Qingtang’s words shocked the Night Soul Beast even more.

This human knew their secret?

No matter how many people entered the Evil Soul Forest, fear crept into their hearts the moment they saw them. And the more people there were, the more fear would accumulate, and the more powerful the Night Soul Beast would become. That was why it had become the notorious terror of the Evil Soul Forest, a demon that could never be defeated.

But now...

Now, the unfearing Ye Qingtang was the only one left in front of the Night Soul Beast. The others had shut off their senses according to Ye Qingtang’s instructions.

Fear was the power source of the Night Soul Beast. Ye Qingtang had cut off its power source and the Night Soul Beast shrank more and more. In the blink of an eye, it had melted down into a cat-size shape. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“So this is the Night Soul Beast’s true form.” Ye Qingtang looked at the small Night Soul Beast curiously.

The Night Soul Beast looked more or less like a black cat. But a pair of grey horns sprouted out from beside its ears and it looked rather strange.

The Night Soul Beast had never seen such a daring human.

Recalling all the humans it had encountered before, all of them had been scared out of their wits the moment they saw it. Even the most powerful could not conceal the fear in their hearts, which only made the beast stronger.

But...

Where did this fellow come from?

He was not afraid of it at all?

Sensing that Ye Qingtang was different from the other humans it had seen, the Night Soul Beast suddenly turned and headed toward the deeper recesses of the forest. Without fear to nourish it, the more calm the other party was, the weaker it would grow.

But there was no way Ye Qingtang would let it go so easily.

She had picked the Evil Soul Forest as a training ground as this place had something very important in her eyes.

In a flash, Ye Qingtang captured the fleeing Night Soul Beast.

Ye Qingtang had no fear in her heart at all. She calmly examined the Night Soul Beast in her hands.

The Night Soul Beast was unable to make use of fear to maintain its form. The originally fearsome Night Soul Beast was now held up in Ye Qingtang’s hands like a strange cat.

The Night Soul Beast: “...”

Ye Qingtang suddenly smiled at the beast.

The Night Soul Beast felt like the sky and earth were spinning so hard that it felt like vomiting. It trembled all over.

It fed on fear and hated happiness to the core.

No fear or panic, only smiles and joy. This was a grievous blow to the Night Soul Beast.

Seeing the Night Soul Beast’s reaction, Ye Qingtang confirmed that the rumors she had heard were true.

Hundreds of years later, several people who desired things from the Evil Soul Forest invaded the forest and ended up with massive fatalities. One of the men was so struck by fear that he turned into an imbecile.. And that imbecile ended up emerging from the Evil Soul Forest carrying a cat-like creature.
