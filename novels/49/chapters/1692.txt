Chapter 1693: The Fight

No one was shocked by Ye Qingtang’s words.

Baili Xuanyun was the last of the top ten from the previous year. Ye Qingtang had no choice but to challenge one of the top ten, so it was natural that she would choose the lowest-ranking of them all.

When he heard Ye Qingtang’s words, Baili Xuanyun only smirked.

“Little lass, don’t be too hasty. Baili Xuanyun is already an advanced Fourth Heaven level. Even Brother Yun is not his match.” Jiang Yiran hurried up to try and stop her.

Jiang Yanyun struggled to sit up and said seriously, “Ye Qingtang, you are not a match for Baili Xuanyun. Don’t force yourself.”

“Since I have come to the Martial Arts Championship, I have to finish it. Otherwise, wouldn’t it be such a waste?” Ye Qingtang looked at the two with a serious expression.

Just as Jiang Yiran was going to say something more, the organizer had already reached the end of his patience. “Ye Qingtang, if you are sure, please proceed to the arena.”

With that said, Ye Qingtang stepped onto the arena. Jiang Yiran and the rest were so anxious that they had a desperate urge to drag her down.

Why was this little girl so stubborn?!

After watching Ye Qingtang ascend the arena, Baili Xuanyun turned to give Mu Ruxue a reassuring look. He then leaped onto the arena and stared at Ye Qingtang with his chin lifted in arrogance.

Up in their seating area, the Jiang family members were solemnly watching the two fighters in the arena.

“Elder Qian, although Ye Qingtang is somewhat more powerful than we previously thought, she is still far from suited to go against Baili Xuanyun. You saw earlier that even Jiang Yanyun was not Baili Xuanyun’s match...” One of the elders spoke up worriedly.

Although they didn’t wish to see Ye Qingtang withdraw without fighting, now that she had really stepped onto the arena, they couldn’t help being concerned about the huge disparity in skill level. They also didn’t want to see her lose terribly.

Elder Qian frowned slightly but kept silent.

Elder Kun and him had jointly shielded Ye Qingtang earlier when she broke through to the Fourth Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate realm. Elder Qian had been very shocked at that time. It must be pointed out that when she first arrived at Taiyuan Valley, Ye Qingtang’s powers were totally insignificant.

But in just half a year, she had managed to break through to the Fourth Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate realm...

This kind of prodigious talent was inconceivable!

Elder Qian had no idea if she would produce another miracle. He was well aware of the huge disparity between someone who just ascended the Fourth Heaven and someone who was already in the advanced stages. Nevertheless, it might be a good thing for Ye Qingtang to have this opportunity to practice her skills. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

By now, the Jiang family was all tense, while the Baili Clan was extraordinarily relaxed. The Baili Clan could hardly be bothered to watch the match between Ye Qingtang and Baili Xuanyun.

It was such a one-sided competition. There was no need for them to pay much attention.

Up on the arena.

“You do have some guts. I thought you were too afraid to show up today.” Baili Xuanyun smiled. He was glad that Ye Qingtang had turned up, it saved him the time and effort to look for her.

Ye Qingtang stared at Baili Xuanyun without any expression.

“Ye Qingtang, I am not at all interested in fighting you, but... you shouldn’t have provoked Ruxue. What happens today—you can only blame yourself for being too foolhardy.” Baili Xuanyun gave a cold smirk.

“Are you done?” Ye Qingtang finally spoke up.

Baili Xuanyun was momentarily taken aback. He never expected Ye Qingtang to behave so calmly at this point.

“Please make your move if you wish to avenge Mu Ruxue.” Ye Qingtang was not at all interested in hearing Baili Xuanyun’s little monologue.
