Every powerful cultivator comprehended the Realm of the Great Dao differently. Some attained a realm that allowed them to alter rules like Ye Qingtang while others might be able to transform demons. Some extremely talented cultivators even comprehended the realm in such a way that allowed them to temporarily transform into a true god. Within that realm, they had no fear of even Emperor-level figures…

“Hmph, let’s see how powerful your Realm of the Great Dao is…” A cold light flickered in the white-robed old man’s eyes. He raised his right arm slightly, and an earth-grade divine weapon slowly appeared in his hand.

Ye Qingtang was expressionless as she looked at the divine weapon in the white-robed old man’s hand.

Earth-grade could be considered to be a true divine weapon. Even though she was currently a Yin Yang Perfected Lord Tenth Heaven, she would be hard-pressed to withstand the might of an earth-level divine weapon.

However…

Ye Qingtang suddenly said blandly, “There are no weapons in my realm.”

As Ye Qingtang spoke, the earth-level divine weapon in the white-robed old man’s hand instantly vanished…

“My divine weapon…”

The white-robed old man stared at his empty hand in shock.

“You… have a death wish!”

The white-robed old man was enraged, and the power of a Heavenly Venerate surged through his body. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The instant the white-robed old man’s Heavenly Venerate power surged, Ye Qingtang spoke again.

“In my realm, the power of a Heavenly Venerate is not permitted to exist.”

The moment she spoke, the power of the Heavenly Venerate throughout the white-robed old man’s body completely vanished.

The old man sank into silence.

Ye Qingtang’s Realm of the Great Dao was just too mysterious and difficult to deal with…

Now that little You Yun had completed her mission, all he had to do was leave with her. There was no need for him to remain and fight Ye Qingtang to the death.

At that thought, the white-robed old man’s body instantly vanished on the spot. He swiftly fled the area within the screen.

The moment he left the screen, the white-robed old man’s earth-level divine weapon and Heavenly Venerate power all rapidly returned.

Only the area within the screen was part of Ye Qingtang’s realm. The moment he left the area, the realm lost its effect.

The white-robed man grabbed little You Yun and little Luo Xue. He tore a fistful of talismans and vanished on the spot.

“Teleport Talisman…”

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly as she muttered to herself.

This type of Teleport Talisman was the work of a Master of Space Transfer and allowed one to bridge space.

At that moment, the white-robed old man had probably left this mainland.

Ye Qingtang descended next to the little white tiger, who was trapped by Heavenly Venerate power. She waved her right arm slightly and dispersed the Heavenly Venerate power so that the little white tiger was free again.

The little white tiger instantly fell into Ye Qingtang’s embrace. It was surprised and delighted to see Ye Qingtang alive again.

“F*ck, I thought you were doomed. Who knew you were so lucky.”

Ye Qingtang did not respond to the little white tiger’s surprised exclamations. Her gaze was distant.

Could nothing be done to change this?

Before the little white tiger could speak again, Ye Qingtang leaped up and took flight.

Falling Sky Valley, which was previously a boisterous valley, was now dead silent. Fresh footprints could vaguely be seen in the pristine public square. The muddled footprints seemed to speak of how this place was bustling just a moment before.

But now…

All that remained was empty space.

Ye Qingtang stood in Falling Sky Valley and looked at the emptiness before her. Not a sound could be heard in the huge valley.

In the past, all birdsong would have vanished by night, leaving only the sound of the wind and the rustling of grass.
