Chapter 2291: Returning To The Academy (1)

At the mention of the fiendcelestial’s tomb, several people believed it was possible.

After all…

Apart from the treasures left behind by the fiendcelestial, where else on earth could there be such a wondrous artifact? Something which could allow someone to break through so many times over such a short period of time?!

The crowd was having a heated discussion, all on the topic of last night’s phenomenon. All the while, Lei Yan and the rest were listening attentively.

Ye Qingtang rapped those brats on the head, indicating that it was time for them to leave.

Even after leaving the city, those teenagers were still deeply curious about last night’s incident.

“Boss, say….do you think that person really came out from the fiendcelestial’s tomb? And he really got a treasure?” Lei Yan had personally experienced the tomb and had his cultivation level rapidly advance in that secret room. He naturally believed it was entirely possible.

Ye Qingtang glanced at him. She could not even be bothered to reply to him.

“If I had known the treasures inside were so formidable, I might have just gritted my teeth and taken one…”

Before Lei Yan could complete his sentence, Ye Qingtang smacked the back of his head.

“Squash that thought if you don’t wish to die.”

Take something from the fiendcelestial’s tomb?

If Ye Qingtang had not been lucky and accidentally stumbled into that secret room, she would have perished inside even if she had a hundred lives to spare.

That black snake that could kill an Emperor level practitioner in seconds was not something which any normal person could handle.

Ye Qingtang also felt rather curious. In her previous life, she had not heard about the black snake inside the tomb. How did those people manage to empty the tomb back then?

Where did the black snake go?

Regardless of the questions circling in her mind, no one would be able to solve this puzzle now.

“I was just making a casual remark. How can I possibly be that brave…” Lei Yan spoke sheepishly. He had an overactive tongue and often spoke without thinking. If he was to really go and do it, he wouldn’t have the guts.

Nangong Lie and the rest stifled the urge to laugh at the sight of Lei Yan being smacked.

Just as Lei Yan was about to say something, Qin Feng quietly shot him a look.

Confused, Lei Yan was about to retort again but Qin Feng’s eyes were full of threat, immediately shutting him up.

The others were more restrained. Apart from that brainless Lei Yan, none of them would dare mention the tomb in front of Ye Qing.

Because…

They had already noticed that although the cultivation in the secret had greatly increased all their powers.

Someone’s cultivation level had remained the same.

And that someone was Ye Qing…

It was a good thing for one’s powers to increase. But the rest of them were very considerate and didn’t make necessary remarks in front of Ye Qing.

Everyone wished to improve their cultivation level, but for some reason, Ye Qing did not experience any progress. Anyone in that situation would feel upset.

They were worried that Ye Qing was upset over this matter, and so kept their mouths shut.

“Boss, are we returning now?” Yun Chen tactfully changed the topic.

Ye Qingtang nodded.

“The selection for the Inter-Academy Competition should be starting soon. Let’s hurry back to the academy before that.”

Strange expressions crossed the faces of the teenagers at Ye Qing’s words.

They had never dreamed of being candidates for the Inter-Academy Competition. After all, their initial powers were among the weakest in the school. There was no way they would dare to dream about the Inter-Academy Competition.

But now…

Things were different!

Hot blood raced in their veins as a measure of confidence bloomed in the hearts of those teenagers.

“Boss, don’t worry. We will definitely not let you down this time! Just wait and see!” Nangong Lie patted his own chest with gusto.
