Chapter 759 So It’s My Fault? (3)

“Don’t stand here. Go back to your cultivation and don’t be lazy.” Yan Shu saved Ye Qingtang from the predicament.

The disciples could only return to their positions for cultivation, but they were still bothered by the incident.

Ye Qingtang greeted Yan Shu and left.

Yan Shu’s sight was complex as he stared at Ye Qingtang’s fading back.

Gu Yihan and the rest all returned to the Admirable Sky Peak at night. They heard about the incident that happened today once they were back.

“The Blue Cloud Peak is way too extreme. How dare they find trouble here?” Qian Ze’s face clouded once he heard about that.

“At least the incident is contained. Though Junior Brother Ye was slightly impetuous, he managed to end it off.” Yan Shu sighed softly. He felt that the new disciple that Master took in was different from other disciples. His temper was totally different from others.

Even Qian Ze and Ye Ningxi who were not disciplined also did not cause any trouble under Perfected Xuanchen’s warning, but Ye Qingtang…

He caused such a big incident when he just entered the valley.

It was lucky that the level of the incident did not increase. If not, there would be much trouble waiting for them.

“Impetuous? I don’t think so. Though Junior Brother Ye is young, he settled things neatly.” Ye Ningxi took a glance at Yan Shu and said.

“Yan Shu, you are too cautious. Master asked us to behave, but not to the extent that we all become cowards. How could we let Li Jingwen go when he beat our disciples? I would definitely fight him with my life if I were present.”

“Fight with your life? You should think about this when you are stronger than him.” Qian Ze smiled and said. Once he finished his words, Ye Ningxi took a cold glimpse at him.

Yin Qingluo did not say anything all the time, but she took a heavy breath and said, “Junior Brother Ye’s ability is stronger than we think. And I don’t think that his behavior was wrong. Since Master became the Valley Master, disciples of other peaks constantly provoked us. We tried to tolerate and back off. However, what’s the result? They’re just getting more presumptuous.”

Yin Qingluo’s words let everyone immerse in thoughts.

They were still fine as they were Perfected Xuanchen’s disciples. However, the normal disciples of the Admirable Sky Peak suffered from injustice.

Even though they had to care for the big picture, no one would feel good with such injustice.

“Everything now is for the harmony of Falling Sky Valley. Master… must have his thoughts,” Yan Shu said.

Gu Yihan frowned slightly and did not say anything. Ji Yixuan, on the other hand, was interested in his new Junior Brother.

“Yan Shu, you were present when Junior Brother Ye fought with Li Jingwen. And since we won, who do you think is stronger? Our Senior Brother or him?” Qian Ze asked as he tried to stir up some trouble.

Yan Shu was stunned.

“Junior Brother Ye.” Gu Yihan glanced at Qian Ze.

Qian Ze shrugged his shoulders and said, “I just asked.”

They discussed for a while but came to no conclusion.

However, as a new disciple who just entered the valley, it was really beyond their expectations that Ye Qingtang could cause such troubles.

But it was just the beginning. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Ye Qingtang returned to the Falling Sky Valley to prevent the tragedy in her previous life from happening again.
