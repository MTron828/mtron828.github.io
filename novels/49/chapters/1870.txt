Chapter 1871: Unexpected Discovery (2)

With a slight twist of its head, Fu Qiu glanced over, but when it saw the portrait, it was stunned.

Ye Qingtang and Jiang Shaobai also had a look when they walked past.

Ye Qingtang froze on the spot when she saw the portrait.

It was a portrait of an ethereal beauty. The beauty had distinct facial features, with a gentle smile on her face. It only took one look for one to unknowingly be mesmerized by her smile.

What surprised her most was that the beauty in the portrait wore a jade pendant around her neck.

Subconsciously running her fingers over her chest, the jade pendant in the portrait was the exact one she wore!

“Sister Qing, why does the lady in the portrait... look so similar to you?” Jiang Shaobai was also shocked when he saw the portrait. The lady resembled Ye Qingtang, with the biggest difference lying in the aura they exuded.

But their facial features were almost identical.

When the girl heard Jiang Shaobai’s words, she turned around to look at Ye Qingtang’s current face. When she saw the unsightly birthmark on the latter’s face, her own darkened.

“What nonsense are you spouting! How does Aunt Jiu even resemble this ugly freak! Go and see the doctor if you have bad eyesight!” The girl lashed out at Jiang Shaobai.

She could never tolerate any slandering of Aunt Jiu.

Jiang Shaobai merely shrugged.

“They really do look alike.”

The girl was about to explode, but Fu Qiu was in a corner, still in a daze.

Ye Qingtang felt even more complicated.

The jade pendant was left behind by her biological mother. Ye Qingtang had actually seen the same jade pendant in the portrait from Jiang Lang. Now, the same jade pendant appeared in the portrait today.

Jiang Lang and the others would always call Ye Qingtang’s mother Jiu Yuan, while this girl called her Aunt Jiu...

Could it be that...

Aunt Jiu was her mother?

The speculation was startling and Ye Qingtang mulled over the information in her head. The reason for taking part in the Martial Arts Championship was to look for clues regarding her mother in the mystic realm, she had never expected such a turn of events.

She had long given up after learning that everything would change every single time she entered the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm.

But now...

Somehow, she had the opportunity to learn more clues about her mother.

Her eyes then riveted on the frozen Fu Qiu, who was filled with shock.

She recalled Fu Qiu calling her ‘Jiu’er’ when it first saw her.

Jiu Yuan, Aunt Jiu, Jiu’er...

Could it be that after the reset of the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm, she had entered the mystic realm that her mother had visited before?

She felt complicated. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Somehow, Ye Qingtang could no longer hear the girl and Jiang Shaobai’s voices anymore. Everything pointed in one direction, and Ye Qingtang needed one more crucial clue to confirm her speculation.

Averting her eyes from Fu Qiu, Ye Qingtang collected herself before dragging Jiang Shaobai out the door.

That night, Ye Qingtang put her thoughts together as she won more spirit stones from the fat catfishes. Even Jiang Shaobai could tell that she wasn’t focused, but he didn’t delve deeper.

Only when the sky gradually turned brighter did they head back to the Crystal Palace. As promised, Long Yi returned the thousand spirit stones to Ye Qingtang.
