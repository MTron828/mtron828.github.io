Chapter 1849: Bet (1)

“Are you up for it? If not, I’m going to leave. Don’t waste my time.” The fat catfish shook its whiskers impatiently.

Ye Qingtang’s face stiffened for a moment, then she asked, “How do you want to bet?”

The fat catfish suddenly opened its mouth and its stomach churned.

“Puff...” It spit out two dice cups from the insides of its stomach.

“I shall not make things difficult for you since you’re new. Let’s just bet with dice,” the fat catfish said as it patted its stomach. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

As Ye Qingtang looked at the dice cup, she saw that it completely coated with the fat catfish’s saliva. Turning around, she looked at Jiang Shaobai and the others with a complicated expression on her face.

“Anyone... know how to do it?” Ye Qingtang asked.

Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo instantly shook their heads.

They had invested all their time and energy into cultivation. Moreover, they were gifted and one of the best among their peers, the elders would never have taught them how to gamble.

Although they had seen other people in the clan doing it, they had never participated.

Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo were definitely prodigies in terms of cultivation, but in terms of goofing around, they definitely had no skills in this kind of ‘play’ at all.

Seeing the two shake their heads, Ye Qingtang’s eyes riveted on Jiang Shaobai. He was definitely the most wild and playful out of the few.

In response, Jiang Shaobai only blinked innocently at her. “Sister... Qing, I’m still young...”

No matter how playful he was, at his age, he would never have the chance to gamble under the supervision of the Jiang family’s elders.

Dammit!

None of them knew how to gamble.

Bunch of useless things!

Ye Qingtang sighed, looking at the fat catfish with difficulty written all over her face.

Baili Xi and the others also had complicated expressions. They had never anticipated such a ridiculous demand to appear in this mystic realm.

Everyone was now stuck in the mystic realm and was completely clueless about the rules. With their previous experience in the cursed mystic realm, it would be best if they could learn about the rules as soon as possible.

“Coughs. How about I give it a go?” Ye Qingtang sounded unconfident.

The fat catfish had seen everything and its eyes lit up.

“Have you come to a decision yet? Are you up for it?”

Ye Qingtang exchanged glances with the others and looked at the fat catfish, showing some hesitation before she finally nodded.

“I’ll... try...”

The fat catfish touched its whiskers as it said, “Great, you can give it a go. However, since we’re making a bet here, what’s your stake?”

The fat catfish was delighted to have run into some newcomers. Everyone knew that newcomers were just like fat sheep ready to be butchered. Thank the heavens for its good luck today. One look and it could tell that they had no experience at all.

“Stake? What would be considered a stake? Money?” When Mu Feiruo heard her, he instantly took some taels out of the space ring.

The fat catfish didn’t bother to even look at the taels, dismissing him with a wave of its fins.

“Who cares about money? Forget it, since you don’t know the rules here, I’ll be nice and remind you. Taels aren’t worth anything here. If you want to make a bet, you can use Dharma artifacts or weapons, things of that sort...”

The fat catfish’s beady eyes landed on Ye Qingtang’s wrist as it spoke.
