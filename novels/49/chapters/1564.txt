Chapter 1565 Potential 2

Jiang Yu was not expecting Ye Qingtang’s potential to be as high as the two of them. However, he sighed in disappointment when he saw the light-red rays.Ye Qingtang’s potential was considered outstanding in other normal families. It was not too bad in the Jiang Family. However, when it came to the inner sect with countless geniuses, her talent was too mediocre, or even could be considered as very bad.

If Ye Qingtang did not have the mutant Heavenly Demon Bloodline, based on her talent, she could not even enter the Elder Cabinet.

Though Jiang Yu was mentally prepared for it, he still could not help but sigh.

Such a pity...

Besides Jiang Yu, the other two inner sect elders also showed disappointment after seeing Ye Qingtang’s test results.

If she had better potential, she might still be able to catch up even after wasting more than ten years outside. However, based on her potential now...

She was not considered as hopeless, but she was definitely incomparable with the rest of the disciples in the Taiyuan Valley.

Furthermore, Ye Qingtang had not been with the Jiang family for more than ten years. She missed the best period of time for cultivation. The elders really felt that it was hopeless.

It was incredibly rare for the family to have a person with the mutant Heavenly Demon Bloodline. However, they did not expect it would turn out like such.

Ye Qingtang did not know what the red light represented. She could guess the results from the looks of disappointment on Jiang Yu’s and the elders’ faces.

She turned back and looked at the light-red color surrounding her, but she was surprisingly calm.

Her spirit root was taken away by Ye You, and the Heart of the Heavenly Dao in her was being suppressed by the Divine Phoenix. Ye Qingtang herself also could not tell what her potential was.

How could her real potential be evaluated when she was chained up?

“Come and look for me later.” Jiang Yu glanced at Ye Qingtang and showed a complex expression. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Elder Qian and the other elder left with Jiang Yu.

All of them were disappointed as one mutant Heavenly Demon Bloodline was wasted. They really felt pity for her.

However, her bloodline was there. Though she could not rely on her potential to reach a supreme level, she might have some achievements if she worked hard enough.

It would be difficult for her to reach the highest stage...

Ye Qingtang stared at the back view of the three people as they walked out. She was in deep thoughts as she stood on top of the round platform. The spirit energy from the pearl still remained, and so did the light rays around her. Therefore, she could not step down.

After a short while, the light rays faded gradually. As Ye Qingtang lowered her head to contemplate, she did not notice the light rays changing suddenly as they converged back into the pearl.

The light-red color in the light suddenly seemed to be soaked by a deep-red color. It was as red as fire. However, it only appeared for a second before the light returned back into the pearl.

The change was not even noticed by Ye Qingtang herself, not mentioning Jiang Yu and the rest who left early.

Ye Qingtang walked down the platform after the light rays disappeared.

No matter what the test result was, nothing could affect her determination.

She was under the death sentence in her previous life, but she cultivated until the Holy Venerate stage from pure determination. She was not that weak anymore in this life, and her cultivation speed was much faster than last time.

She still believed in herself no matter what others said to discourage her.

She believed that her life was in her own hands and never determined by fate!

She would never give up any opportunity.

Ye Qingtang had a plan in her heart as she stared at the ten thousand honor points in her hand.

She would definitely join the Martial Arts Championship held half a year from now.

Ye Qingtang walked out of the martial hall and looked for Jiang Yu per his instructions.
