Chapter 1483 The Mantis Stalks the Cicada, Unaware of the Oriole Behind 1

The forest in this area had almost been trampled flat, and the ground was in ruins. Along the way, Ye Qingtang and the others discovered the half-decomposed corpse of a small demon.

Although it was a small demon, demons grew up to five or six meters high. Half of its body was terribly mangled as if it had been flattened by something.

“It’s the small demon that accompanies that big demon from the Frosty Snow Mountains.” Jiang Shangyu paused to look at the half-decomposed corpse of the small demon. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Most of the dominant big demons were accompanied by small demons. When the big demon in the Frosty Snow Mountain headed for the Land of Infinite Demons, hundreds of small demons accompanied it. They had formed formidable troops, which carried the big demon in a demon sedan.

From the looks of it, the small demon’s body had been crushed by the big demon’s foot as they advanced.

“The big demon’s body should be somewhere nearby,” Jiang Shangyu said as he looked up.

Everyone was on high alert. The big demon had died recently, and its flesh had not yet begun to decay. This was a rare treasure. It would be great if they could find it quickly.

Jiang Shangyu’s steps quickened.

But after the group from the Jiang Family walked for a while, they suddenly heard the sounds of an intense fight coming from the thick mist ahead.

All they could see was a large swamp with nearly a hundred figures involved in an intense fight.

They were in the thick of the fight, but about a hundred meters behind them, a huge black figure, as large as a mountain, could vaguely be seen lying motionlessly on the ground.

The swamp had drowned many of the small demons’ corpses. The small demons looked similar to those that Ye Qingtang and the others had encountered along the way.

But now, these small demons were all dead and were slowly being engulfed by the swamp.

When big demons entered the Land of Infinite Demons, they usually brought along a horde of small demons. After they sent their treasure into the Land of Infinite Demons, they would kill all the small demons almost as if to provide themselves with grave goods.

“Are those from the Cloud Valley Clan and the Southern Peak Clan?” Jiang Xun squinted at the two sides that were embroiled in battle. He could identify them from their clothing.

The Cloud Valley Clan and the Southern Peak Clan were both reclusive ancient clans of Central Mainland. However, both of them were very powerful and were two of the few ancient clans that were able to enter the Land of Infinite Demons.

These two ancient clans were on par in terms of power but usually minded their own business. However, they had somehow started fighting in the Land of Infinite Demons.

The Jiang Family members were no fools. When they saw the corpses of the small demons and the huge black figure lying on the ground, they knew what was going on.

The black figure was certainly the big demon from the Frosty Snow Mountains. The two ancient clans must have simultaneously discovered the body of the large demon and ended up fighting over its body and its grave goods.

The Domain Monarch’s Jiang Clan were probably not the only ones who had heard the news of the big demon of Frosty Snow Mountain.

“Fifth Great-uncle, what should we do?” Jiang Shun looked at Jiang Shangyu.

“We’ll wait and see,” Jiang Shangyu said calmly, his lips curving in a chilly smile.

The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware that the oriole is behind him. The big demon had just died, and its entire body was essentially treasure. Anyone who obtained it could greatly boost their family’s strength. No one would willingly let it go.

The Cloud Valley Clan and the Southern Peak Clan were both very powerful. If they barged in, it would turn into a three-way fight.

But if they waited for the two clans to defeat each other, the Jiangs might reap the benefits.

With that, the Jiang Family group hid their aura with the help of the demon aura in the area and waited for the two ancient clans to wear out each other.
