Chapter 1968: Guests From All Places (3)

The people there all started panicking as they saw their only hope, the Holy Lord of Shadows, walking away.

Xue Fu spoke up. “The Holy Lord of Shadows has decreed that since the Central Mainland is currently in a dire state, she will offer a helping hand and allow all of you to stay in the Temple of Shadows for now.”

Visible relief filled them.

They could finally set down a huge stone within their hearts.

But before even waiting for joy to fill their faces Xue Fu spoke again. “Where is the Sacred Martial Academy?”

Everyone froze as they heard this.

Moments later, the President of the Sacred Martial Academy walked forward uneasily with a few people by his side.

“Greetings, Guardian. I am the President of the Sacred Martial Academy. What orders do you have for me?”

Xue Fu glanced at the terrified President and ignored him. He then lifted his chin at an Undead Clan guard by his side.

Before the President of the Sacred Martial Academy could understand what was going on, the Undead Clan guards had grabbed all of them and threw them out of the temple.

“Guardian! “Guardian! What’s happening?”

The President was in a panic.

Didn’t the Holy Lord just say that she was offering them shelter?

“The people of the Sacred Martial Academy are not to take one step into the Temple of Shadows or they will be killed without hesitation,” Xue Fu said expressionlessly.

If not for the generosity of the Holy Lord, Xue Fu and the other wouldn’t even have shown any compassion to the human race. They had nothing to say now that Ye Qingtang had ordered them to throw out the Sacred Martial Academy.

Everyone from the Sacred Martial Academy started panicking. They had no idea why everyone else had been offered the protection of the Temple of Shadows and they were the only ones being thrown out.

They hadn’t done anything yet, so how exactly had offended the Holy Lord of Shadows?

No matter how hard they should, they couldn’t understand this at all. But they were unwilling to give up their last hope even after they had been thrown out. They knelt in front of the Temple of Shadows and begged bitterly to be let in.

The Sacred Martial Academy had been pursued and hunted by the enemy and had barely escaped with their lives, pinning their hopes on the protection of the Temple of Shadows.

If the Temple of Shadows rejected them, they would be killed and mutilated so badly there would be no bodies left to bury the moment they left.

But no matter how much they begged, there was no response.

Xue Fu paid no heed and ordered the Undead Clan guard impatiently to throw the Sacred Martial Academy out of the Temple of Shadows.

The moment they were thrown out, their enemies who had been waiting outside the Temple of Shadows all rushed in for the kill. In the blink of an eye, the people from the Sacred Martial Academy had all been massacred, with not a single one left.

Xue Fu merely nodded lightly after being informed of this. The other people in the temple all shivered as they heard the news.

As the Sacred Martial Academy lay outside covered in blood, everyone was reminded of how their enemies were all lying in wait right outside the Temple of Shadows, ready to attack them at a moment’s notice.

They didn’t dare enter solely because of the might of the Temple of Shadows. Which meant that only death awaited them if they stepped out of the Temple of Shadows. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

In an instant, everyone was determined to stay in the Temple of Shadows. They would rather kill themselves than leave!

Ye Qingtang had no time to care about the deaths of the Sacred Martial Academy since Ming Wang had brought more news. .The other people from the Jiang family had arrived, along with the Northstar Demon Lord who had been protecting them.
