Chapter 1480 All-Pervading Demonic Air 1

Furthermore, the cultivation conditions in the Elder Cabinet were the best in the Jiang Family. Anyone produced from the Elder Cabinet was a top expert of the Jiang Family and was simply incomparable with other youths in the Jiang Family like Jiang Yiming.

Ambition emerged in Ye You’s eyes.

If she could enter the Elder Cabinet to cultivate…

“Aunt Qin, are all of the people who can enter the Elder Cabinet very powerful? Those like me probably will not have a chance in this lifetime right…” Ye You muttered as though she was aggrieved.

Seeing Ye You’s expression, Jiang Qin immediately persuaded, “You, there’s no need for self-pity. Those who can enter the Elder Cabinet to cultivate were personally selected by the cabinet elders since young and have always been training there. You are pretty talented. If you were born in the Jiang Family, you would definitely be selected to enter the Elder Cabinet. It’s just a pity… But you don’t need to worry. Since you’re back, I will naturally fight for the best cultivation opportunities for you.”

Jiang Qin always felt that Ye You had good endowments since she could cultivate to such a state even when she was in the lacking First Mainland before. If she was in the Jiang Family from the start, perhaps she could have entered the Elder Cabinet and reached a much higher cultivation realm than Jiang Yiming now.

“Aunt Qin, I just think that you are too nice to me. I want to become powerful sooner, so I can protect you in the future too,” Ye You said gently, though a hint of coldness flashed across her eyes discreetly when she spotted Ye Qingtang from the corner of her eyes.

The apology from that day was like a thorn buried in Ye You’s heart.

She would not easily forget that humiliation.

Jiang Qin was gratified at Ye You’s ‘obedience’. Sensing Ye You’s line of sight, Jiang Qin could not help but sneer when she saw Ye Qingtang aside.

“You, don’t worry. I definitely will not let Ye Qingtang make it out of the Land of Infinite Demons alive.” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Ye You nodded obediently and looked down to sweep away the expression in her eyes.

“Aunt Qin, Ye Qingtang will not be able to enter the Elder Cabinet as well, right?” Ye You asked suddenly.

Ye You’s endowments were considered pretty great, but her initial spirit root was inferior; thus, she stole Ye Qingtang’s spirit root. If not for the support of that spirit root, it was simply impossible for her cultivation realm to increase so rapidly.

Jiang Qin scoffed. “Her? She’s just a useless person who does not have a spirit root. Although a spirit root is not required in the Central Mainland, every youth selected by the Elder Cabinet is the finest talent. Since she is already missing a spirit root, how can she be selected by the Elder Cabinet?”

Ye You beamed and did not say anything else.

Very soon, the Jiang Family troops were about to set off. With Jiang Shangyu leading the troop at the front, the mighty troops left the Jiang Residence rapidly.

Beidou Demon Lord was not part of the Jiang Family and could not tag along. Fortunately, most of his injuries were already healed. It was unknown when Ye Qingtang would return from this trip, and it was inappropriate for him to stay in the Jiang Residence for long. He bade farewell to Ye Qingtang before she departed and then left the Jiang Residence in search of a good location to cultivate with that Bone of the Dragon Breath.

This farewell was a turning point for the Beidou Demon Lord—with the Bone of the Dragon Breath, he had a greater opportunity than last time. The next time they meet, he would become the majestic and renowned talent of the demon clan as last time and would obtain his deserving title of the Beidou Demon Lord.

As the carriage moved, Ye Qingtang watched Beidou Demon Lord leave gradually with a slight smile.
