Chapter 2010: Relentless (2)

Bai Zhi was extremely displeased by You Qiong’s attitude.

“Hm? The Ancient You Clan is finally scared of us?” she said.

“Scared?” He laughed and continued, “I think there’s been a misunderstanding. What do we have to fear? I’m only here today to pass on a message. You don’t want to have the Ancient You Clan as your enemy.”

“What?” Bai Zhi’s face darkened as she heard this.

Ignoring this, You Qiong continued, “With our current power, the Crimson League is nothing to us. The only reason we didn’t fight with you the other time was to save you some face. I’m here today to tell you that if you lift a hand to interfere with the matters of the Central Mainland, we will retaliate with an attack on the Second Domain and you will be our first target!”

His words were like a crack of thunder, shaking the entire Temple of Shadows.

Who would’ve expected that even though they had come bearing presents looking like they were ready to beg for mercy, that they would say such shocking things?

Did they want to attack the Crimson League?

How ludicrous!

“Outrageous!” Ye Qingtang exclaimed in a low voice.

Yet she silently gave his declaration a thumbs up in her mind.

Well done!

“Outrageous? So what if we say things like this?” He continued to speak in an arrogant tone as he raised his hands nonchalantly and placed them on the beautiful boxes behind him.

“The Netherworld Ring belongs to us now. But my Clan Leader is a man of generosity and has brought all these gifts to trade for it. We hope that the Crimson League can understand the situation and leave the Central Mainland with these gifts. The Central Mainland will be the Ancient You Clan’s power from now on, so please do not interfere with us.”

To think that he dared to speak with much arrogance.

You Qiong’s acting was great and he instantly turned the gifts that Elder Mo and sent as an offering into something demeaning.

The guards behind him were all of low ranking and merely followed along with him. Elder Mo had sent You Qiong as he was unwilling to step into the Temple of Shadows inside and had also planned for him and the guards to be slaughtered by the Crimson League as a sacrifice. He was willing to do anything to ease the anger in his heart.

Not knowing the true situation, the soldiers all thought that this was the Clan Leaders will and started feeling arrogant as well.

Bai Zhi and the other ambassador’s face all darkened in an instant. The ambassador who had not spoken at all till now like a porcelain doll closed his eyes.

Seeing that she had stoked the flames enough, Ye Qingtang suddenly raised her hand. A beam of light shot out and slammed You Qiong into the wall.

His eyes widened in surprise but before he could say anything, a spurt of blood burst from his mouth and he died on the spot.

The moment Ye Qingtang had made her move, Bai Zhi had made hers as well, and vines erupted from the ground, crushing the Ancient You Clan soldiers to smithereens.

“That d*mned Ancient You Clan! How dare they show such arrogance! I don’t think we can placate the anger of the Crimson League without killing them off!” Bai Zhi’s eyes were red and she was seething in anger.

The ambassador in black robes raised his hands and turned the ‘gifts’ into ashes.

“Mo Yao, gather information on the power of the Ancient You Clan as soon as possible. They will be finished once our troops get here!” A cold voice emanated from within the black robes.

Ye Qingtang nodded slightly. The black-robed ambassador left, with Bai Zhi behind him.

The Ancient You Clan hadn’t treated the Crimson League seriously at all and had humiliated them right in front of them. How dare a mere organization from the First Domain offend the Crimson League!
