Subsequently, Han Cangming did not say anything as he shut his eyes and calmed his mind.

There was worry in Mu Su’s eyes when he saw Han Cangming’s reaction, but he could only retreat to a side silently without disturbing Han Cangming in his meditation.

His Highness’s condition seems to be even worse.

Anxiety filled Mu Su.

After losing the suppression of the Heart of the Demon God, the surging Aura of the Evil in the world invaded Han Cangming’s body continuously. Even though he possessed such godly powers, without the suppression of the Heart of the Demon God, the overbearing powers were not what any human body could contain.

His Highness stayed beside Lady Ye as a silver wolf previously and could more or less use the Heart of the Demon God to suppress the Aura of the Evil in his body. However, Lady Ye often went out on missions, and although His Highness could follow nearby from a distance away, it was still unable to suppress the overactive Aura of the Evil.

If this went on, he was afraid that His Highness’s body would no longer be able to accommodate this powerful force.

If His Highness even used a little energy to turn into a silver wolf now, his body would probably shatter… It was impossible to even go to Lady Ye already.

Now, his condition could only be stabilized by making use of the spirit energy on Drifting Cloud Island, though it was still unknown how long this method could sustain for.

“I still have to think of a way to let His Highness stay beside Lady Ye more often.” Mu Su was rather frustrated. Staying beside Ye Qingtang as a silver wolf was simply not a long-term plan. However, he always felt that Lady Ye seemed to be very afraid of His Highness.

At the Spirit Condensation Mountain Village the other time, His Highness already requested Lady Ye to “marry” him, but her reaction was really…

Mu Su sighed secretly. He was extremely worried about His Highness’s condition.

When they were unaware of the location of the Heart of the Demon God, His Highness spent most of the time on Drifting Cloud Island to suppress the Aura of the Evil and would only be out once in a while. Yet, now that the Heart of the Demon God was found, they could not retrieve it immediately…

Just thinking about it, Mu Su felt that it was as though he had a mouthful of blood that would never disappear completely.

“I don’t know if His Highness’s condition would improve with Lady Ye on Drifting Cloud Island as well. If it does improve, maybe he can even use this chance to develop his relationship with Lady Ye.” At that thought, Mu Su looked at Han Cangming who was seated on the jade stage. When he saw the blaring streaks of blood on Han Cangming’s neck, he was even more anxious.

Mu Su was filled with worry on this side, and on the other, the Xuanling Sect people were already led to the main venue of the Three Sect Competition.

Disciples from the other two sects were already gathered at the wide court.

“Elder Du, I heard that you accepted an official disciple with extremely high talent. Do you intend on sending him out this year?” an elder from Qinglin Sect asked a Wind Moon Sect elder with a smile.

The Wind Moon Sect elder replied. “Qingyu is still young. I brought him this year only to accumulate experience. I don’t intend to send him out.”

“That’s a pity then. I was pretty shocked when I heard that Shen Qingyu entered your Wind Moon Sect. That child has been very gifted since young. I still intended to accept him as a disciple previously, but Elder Du beat me to it. Coming to think of it, he will ultimately display his skills in the Three Sect Competition. I will be really expectant at that time,” the Qinglin Sect elder said cheerfully.

“You’re too polite, Elder Qian. You already have such an excellent and unrivaled disciple, Fu Lingtian. There’s no need to be bothered by anything else,” said the Wind Moon Sect elder.
