Chapter 1513 The Forbidden Place of Infinite Demons 1

People of the Jiang Family were stunned when they saw Ye Qingtang enter the fog-covered area. They did not follow her and stopped right outside.

“Is this the... forbidden land?” One of the men glanced at the heavy fog in front of him. The fog seemed to separate the inner area from the outer perimeter, forming a forbidden zone.

The forbidden land of the Land of Infinite Demons was the place that all forces tried to avoid when they came to the Land of Infinite Demons.

No one knew what was in the forbidden land, but everyone was clear that no one had made it out alive from it before.

Many powerful figures had come over after hearing about the forbidden land; even the big demons and demon kings wanted to enter this place to discover its secrets.

However, those figures were not seen again after they entered the forbidden land.

There was a slight chance of survival in the Land of Infinite Demons.

There was absolutely no chance of survival in the forbidden land.

The disciples of the Jiang Family felt now. They did not expect that Ye Qingtang would dare to enter the forbidden land.

“What should we do now?” They exchanged glances with each other.

“It’s been a few thousand years since someone entered the forbidden land.” A young man frowned and said.

They heard about how dangerous it was in the forbidden area, but those legends were from a few thousand or even ten thousand years ago.

According to the legends, the forbidden land was extremely dangerous, but it contained even more treasures. If they could kill Ye Qingtang inside and bring back treasures, they would definitely be rewarded.

A few of the disciples had visited the Land of Infinite Demons a few times before and were confident with their abilities.

If they could figure out the secret of the forbidden place, they might even have the chance to enter the Elder Cabinet of the Jiang Family.

After some hesitation, an ambitious young man entered the fog.

Sometimes, ambition and greed would bury one’s fear.

The rest of the disciples had the same thought. They would not be able to explain themselves if they did not kill Ye Qingtang.

All of them entered the fog immediately.

Jiang Qin arrived at the place a little later and witnessed those disciples entering the fog. She froze on the spot and wanted to stop them. But it was too late.

Only vague outlines could be seen in the heavy, humid fog.

Ye Qingtang felt strange after she dashed into the fog with the little white tiger. The humidity in the fog was in contact with the big demon’s blood on her body, causing the blood that was almost dry to became thick and sticky again.

She could also feel the coldness along with the humidity, and her teeth began trembling under the cold.

Although she had to escape, Ye Qingtang slowed down under the thick fog as she could not see anything.

“Ling Yan...” Ye Qingtang took out the voice transmission stone instinctively and wanted to get some clues from Ling Yan.

However, Ye Qingtang realized that the spirit energy in the voice transmission stone dispersed when she held the stone in her hand. It was just a cold and normal stone now. What she said just now was not transmitted, and there was no response from Ling Yan.
