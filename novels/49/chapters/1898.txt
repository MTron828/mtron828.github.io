Chapter 1899: Massacre (5)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

White Tiger sprinted forward with Ye Qingtang and Jiang Shaobai on its back. Blood continued to pour forth from Jiang Shaobai’s wound while Ye Qingtang’s heart pounded heavily.

It was only after White Tiger confirmed that no one was pursuing them that Ye Qingtang finally told it to find a safe spot at the foot of the mountain to take a rest.

Jiang Shaobai was gravely injured. He was unconscious and his entire body felt feverish to the touch. It was like a ball of fire that had been ignited in his body.

Without leaving any for herself, Ye Qingtang administered all of her sacred healing elixirs to Jiang Shaobai. It was only then that his breathing finally became more steady.

Ye Qingtang started to clean up his wound. She drew back in shock and nearly stopped breathing when she saw the deep gash and the shattered skull bone beneath.

Jiang Shaobai’s powers were a mystery to her. Ye Qingtang had never sparred with Jiang Shaobai before but following her recent breakthrough, she could feel that Jiang Shaobai’s powers were far beyond that of Jiang Yanyun’s. In fact... he must have already attained the Sixth Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate realm.

Also, he was powerful enough to stand shoulder to shoulder with Baili Xi from the first Martial Arts Championship.

But...

She had just left Jiang Shaobai’s side for a few minutes. How had someone already managed to cause such grievous injuries to him?

It was strange. Ye Qingtang hadn’t even heard the slightest hint of a skirmish. From that, it was clear that the fight was a one-sided battle, with Jiang Shaobai on the losing end... Someone formidable enough to completely overpower Jiang Shaobai—that person must be at least two levels higher than him...

Ye Qingtang found the situation increasingly bizarre. Taiyuan Valley had been destroyed, the Jiang family residence was also desecrated. As much as Ye Qingtang wanted to get to the bottom of this, she was unable to return to the Jiang family residence to investigate the matter.

That person was still at the Jiang family residence.

Who the hell was that person? Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Unfortunately, only Jiang Shaobai would know.

Ye Qingtang didn’t dare to move Jiang Shaobai due to his serious injuries. She had no choice but to lay low with him for the moment so that he could recuperate.

Now they could no longer return to the Jiang family residence, even though Ye Qingtang desperately wished to know whether Jiang Lang and his wife Jiang Xun were safe.

As for the identity of that person, they had no choice but to wait until Jiang Shaobai regained consciousness.

Ye Qingtang decided to let Little White Tiger stand guard in case the person secretly caught up with them—meanwhile, she would concentrate on taking care of Jiang Shaobai.

Jiang Shaobai slept for seven consecutive days.

On the eighth day, Jiang Shaobai uttered a low groan. Ye Qingtang immediately turned toward him.

“Shaobai?”

Jiang Shaobai slowly opened his eyes. His pale face was dazed as he stared at Ye Qingtang with his head slightly tilted.

“Shaobai, how are you feeling?”

Jiang Shaobai didn’t reply but just continued staring at Ye Qingtang. There was no expression on his face and his calmness disturbed Ye Qingtang.

“Shaobai?” Ye Qingtang repeated.

Suddenly Jiang Shaobai blinked, then he opened his mouth.

“Shaobai.”

“...” Ye Qingtang was stunned. A shocking thought popped into her mind as she glanced hesitantly at the youth.

“Jiang Shaobai?”

“Jiang Shaobai,” he repeated dully.

Ye Qingtang was completely thunderstruck.

She stared into Jiang Shaobai’s empty eyes. That intelligent and impish face was now as simple and befuddled as a child’s.

“Hehe, Shaobai.” Jiang Shaobai suddenly giggled as he looked at Ye Qingtang’s stiff expression. He repeated his name and lifted his injured hand to touch Ye Qingtang’s face.
