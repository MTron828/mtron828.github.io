Chapter 1650: See You In the Arena (2)

A figure suddenly appeared before Jiang Yisheng and the Qiu Family youths. The next moment, the two youths holding down Jiang Yisheng were sent flying with a kick.

Jiang Yisheng was shocked. Only then did he realize that it was Jiang Shaobai who had appeared!

“Shaobai!”

Jiang Shaobai was smiling brilliantly as usual, but there was no amusement in her eyes. She narrowed her eyes and swept a glance over the Qiu Family members that were present. Her eyes were frosty.

“Another one looking to die. Get her!” The Qiu Family youths did not care who she was. They would rely on their superior numbers to teach them a lesson.

One of the youths tried to take the opportunity to ambush Jiang Shaobai from behind, but before he could get close, Ye Qingtang suddenly appeared and threw him over her shoulder. He was sent flying!

“Qingtang...” Jiang Yisheng could not help but feel emotional when Jiang Shaobai and Ye Qingtang suddenly appeared.

“Elder Brother Yi, we’re here to help you! We’ll kill them!” The two youths who were with Ye Qingtang and Jiang Shaobai rolled up their sleeves and rushed in.

They were all hot-blooded youths. They could not restrain their anger when they saw their family members being beaten up.

The appearance of Ye Qingtang and her companions rescued Jiang Yisheng and the others from their dangerous situation. The two sides were ready to give tit for tat, and a bloody battle was imminent.

“What are you doing?” A low shout suddenly entered their ears.

When the group of Qiu Family youths heard the voice, they froze and turned towards the sound.

A displeased looking Qiu Chen was slowly walking towards them together with a refined and gentle-looking youth.

“Qiu Chen, we tried to make allowances, but they would have none of it. We...”

Qiu Chen frowned and slapped the talkative youth.

The youth’s face turned bright red from the blow, but he just covered his face and did not dare to make a sound. He lowered his head guiltily.

“Elder asked you to quickly rectify the situation, not waste your time with every Tom, Dick, and Harry. If you’re not serious about joining the Martial Arts Championship, you better get lost. Don’t stay here and embarrass the Qiu Family.” Qiu Chen berated them coldly. The group of Qiu Family youths all shook in their shoes. No one dared to show any signs of their temper.

The gentle-looking youth next to Qiu Chen smiled. His gaze swept across the Qiu Family members, Ye Qingtang, and the others. When he saw the injuries that Jiang Yisheng and the others had sustained, he immediately understood what had happened. He stepped forward and spoke with a smile.

“I’m sorry. They just got to the island and are rather worked up. They could not control their strength and injured our friends from the Jiang Family.” As he spoke, he glanced at the Qiu Family youths and said, “Your priorities are all wrong. If you injure them before the Martial Arts Championship, the Jiang Family will have fewer participants. How will they safeguard their Domain Monarch’s reputation then?”

The gentle-looking youth seemed to be rebuking his companions, but he implied that the Jiang Family was no match for them. His attitude was condescending and dismissive.

“Qiu Heyang, what are you saying! If your Qiu Family had not relied on superior numbers, you might be the one lying on the ground now!” Jiang Yisheng was instantly furious.

The youth named Qiu Heyang simply smiled and did not reply.

When Qiu Chen heard Jiang Yisheng’s words, he smiled arrogantly. “There’s safety in numbers. But I’ll give you a chance. If you can beat me, I’ll admit that our Qiu Family relied on superior numbers to bully you.”
