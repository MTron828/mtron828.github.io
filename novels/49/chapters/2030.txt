Chapter 2031: Big Victory (2)

“We... won? Elder, we just won against the Ancient You Clan!” A stunned Ancient Clan youth quickly came to his senses and shouted excitedly. He was shaking so hard he could barely support himself.

The entire Central Mainland had been in a state of panic ever since the rise of the Ancient You Clan.

How many Ancient Clans had perished cruelly under the Ancient You Clan’s hands and how many of them had escaped from their home to seek refuge at the Temple of Shadows?

And now...

The Ancient You Clan which they had seen as invincible had suffered their first defeat.

After a moment of dead silence, the Ancient Clans and Demon Clan realized their victory and roared in joy.

They could finally vent their suppressed anger.

They won!

“I guess this is the limit of the Ancient You Clan as a power of the First Domain. It’s nothing special at all. It’s a wonder someone like them even managed to overtake the whole Central Mainland.

“The Ancient You Clan is from the First Domain but their fighting power has far surpassed it and is now at the level of the Heng State,” Mi said. Even though they were victorious, he had to admit that their power had far surpassed the level of the first domain.

They might even be able to become a formidable power in the Second Domain.

However...

They would be nothing compared to the Crimson League.

“You’re giving them too much credit, Mi.” Bai Zhi didn’t feel the same way. She had never paid any heed to the powers of the First Domain.

To her, they were no more than ants.

“The Ancient You Clan has risen for less than a year. They had trained the youths to surpass the power of the first domain in merely one year. It was truly shocking.

If they were to let the Ancient You Clan be, they might have been able to elevate the entire clan’s power to surpass the first domain. Their power would rise by over a hundredfold if that happened.

Bai Zhi let out a noncommittal sound.

Ye Qingtang had returned and she was not surprised by their victory at all. She knew that the Ancient You Clan was doomed the moment she saw the Crimson League’s forces.

She had overheard what Mi had said as well.

The Ancient You Clan had not actually planned to advance rashly. They had only limited their power to the First Domain and only wanted to grow slowly before taking the next step. They had not planned on provoking the Second Domain at all.

However...

But they were extremely unlucky. They never expected that Ye Qingtang would stir up trouble between them and the Crimson League when they had yet to amass their power.

They would never in a million years have imagined that they would meet with such a disaster.

“I’ll leave the rest to you.” Mi looked at her and left with the Crimson League.

She immediately understood what he meant. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

She immediately asked for Ming Wang to send people over to clean up the battlefield. Elder Cong had fled, and one-third of the Ancient You Clan’s forces had been taken care of. All their riches and resources were theirs now.
