Chapter 763 Inter-Disciples Learning (1)

Xuanyuan Lie was a ranked disciple in Falling Sky Valley. He was Full Moon Peak’s top disciple and the grandson of Full Moon Peak’s Peak Master.

Xuanyuan Lie was extremely gifted and was personally taught by Full Moon Peak’s Peak Master since young. Although he was so young, his skills were already amazing.

Given Xuanyuan Lie’s skills, even someone at an Elder level in Falling Sky Valley might not be his opponent.

While Blue Cloud Peak leaned towards Full Moon Peak, Li Jingwen did not have a slight chance of interacting with Xuanyuan Lie and only met him a few times without any chance to speak.

It could be said that Xuanyuan Lie was the representative of the most powerful disciple in Falling Sky Valley.

And the icon who countless disciples wanted to emulate after.

Liu Mo shook his head. “There’s no need. Since Senior Brother Xuanyuan asked me out for a drink at night, it does not interfere with me going to beat Ye Chen up now.”

“That’s good then.” Li Jingwen smiled.

“Help me reply to Senior Brother Xuanyuan that I’ll definitely be punctual for our appointment,” Liu Mo said.

That disciple nodded and hurriedly carried out the orders.

“You’re indeed on close terms with Senior Brother Xuanyuan. I’ve never seen Senior Brother Xuanyuan interact with other disciples in the valley, but he extended an invitation to you today.” Li Jingwen grinned.

Liu Mo had an indifferent expression on his face, but a trace of a smile emerged in his eyes.

Given Xuanyuan Lie’s skills, he was no longer on the same level as ordinary disciples and would naturally not bother with the disciples in the valley.

“Senior Brother Xuanyuan is prideful. but he has the capital to be so, unlike someone who thinks that he can do whatever he wants in Falling Sky Valley just because he became the Valley Master’s disciples.” Li Jingwen pointed out.

Liu Mo nodded slightly.

The two of them did not say anything and headed straight to Admirable Sky Peak.

On Admirable Sky Peak, Ye Qingtang made a rare trip to the disciples’ cultivation field but was stopped by a lady before she walked far.

“I’ve heard that my new little junior brother is very pretty and charming. After meeting him today, the rumors are indeed true.” Ye Ningxi’s lips curled up as she sized up Ye Qingtang without concealing.

Yin Qingluo, who came with Ye Ningxi, could not help but have a headache when she saw Ye Ningxi’s behavior. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Junior Brother Ye, this is Ye Ningxi, Senior Sister Ye. She is not in the valley usually, which is why you only got to meet her today.” Yin Qingluo explained hurriedly, fearful that the young Ye Qingtang would be frightened by Ye Ningxi.

Yin Qingluo originally did not like Ye Qingtang’s method of becoming apprenticed to their Master, but after Ye Qingtang beat Li Jingwen up, her opinion of this new junior brother changed evidently.

As Ye Qingtang looked at Ye Ningxi, who had an enchanting smile on her face, a trace of reminiscence emerged in her eyes.

This Senior Sister Ye Ningxi was someone she was very familiar with in her previous life. She might look flippant, but once she attacked, it was deadly vicious.

“Greetings, Senior Sister Ye,” Ye Qingtang said calmly.

Ye Ningxi chuckled as she naturally placed her fair hands on Ye Qingtang’s shoulder.

“Your face is really endearing. With a look, it’s actually even more beautiful than a lady’s face.”

“…” Ye Qingtang was speechless.

“Senior Sister Ye…” Yin Qingluo’s headache worsened, and she immediately stepped forward to pull Ye Ningxi’s dishonest hand away.

“Little Qingqing, you did wrong. When I asked you how Junior Brother Ye looked like the other time, you hid it from me. Could it be that you took a fancy on him and that you’re scared that I would snatch him away?” Ye Ningxi raised her brow.

Yin Qingluo was just a step away from covering Ye Ningxi’s mouth with her hand.
