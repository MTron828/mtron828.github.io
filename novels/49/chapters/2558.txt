Ye Qingtang had been very interested in the Ancient God Karma Tunnel. But the big yellow dog had just poured a bucket of ice water all over her enthusiasm. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“If you want to absorb the Heavenly Dao energy in your heart, you have no choice but to try. Otherwise, I definitely don’t recommend you to enter the Ancient God Karma Tunnel,” the big yellow dog said as it stared at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang fell into deep thought.

It was true that she did not know much about the Heart of Heavenly Dao in her body. She did not know how much power there was and how far she could grow if she could really absorb it.

“Do you think there’s a need to take this risk?” Ye Qingtang asked the big yellow dog.

No matter how unreliable the big yellow dog was, it was still from the upper realm. Even though she had lived two lives, she might not be as knowledgeable as the big yellow dog.

“I think it’s worth it.” The big yellow dog pondered for a moment before saying. “Besides, even I can’t see through the thickness of the Heavenly Dao energy in your heart. It should be very considerable. If you can really absorb this energy and control it perfectly, I estimate your growth will be impossible to calculate. Furthermore, even if you don’t manage to absorb the power but managed to visit a wonderland in the Ancient God Karma Tunnel… your life would have been worth living.”

“Alright, I understand. There’s no need to say anything else.” Seeing that the big yellow dog still wanted to say something, Ye Qingtang hurriedly stopped it. She was worried that it would continue saying things that would make her lose her confidence.

“When will the Ancient God Karma Tunnel open?” Ye Qingtang asked a moment later.

“I only sensed it recently. Actually, it opened some time ago, but no one is close to it yet. However, if you want to enter the Ancient God Karma Tunnel, it’s best to wait a few more days. Currently, the karma energy around the tunnel is still very strong. If you head over now, you might be tainted by ominous karma,” the big yellow dog explained.

Ye Qingtang nodded slightly. She did not intend to set off immediately. She could not leave the Dragon Emperor Clan as and when she liked anyway.

...

At that instant, in the central hall of the Dragon Emperor Clan…

The white-haired elder entered the hall. In the middle of the hall sat an elder in a black robe. The black-robed elder emitted a cold and strange aura, making people unwilling to approach him.

“Long Yun.”

The black-robed elder opened his eyes the moment the white-haired elder entered the hall. Those eyes seemed to be able to pierce through time and space, captivating one’s soul.

“I am here.”

Long Yun bowed respectfully.

“The Evil Deity told you to investigate the Immortal Emperor. How is your investigation?” the black-robed old elder asked.

“Apart from our Dragon Emperor Clan, the Temple of Paragon and the Devil Cloud Sect also turned up. However, we failed to find that Immortal Emperor. However, judging from the movements of the Temple of Paragon and the Devil Cloud Sect, I’m afraid that the existence of an Immortal Emperor is not fake. Perhaps that Immortal Emperor is on guard and is hiding somewhere,” Long Yun explained.

The black-robed elder said, “Two days ago, several people from the Ten Thousand Poison Valley returned. They said they saw Di Jiuyuan.”

Long Yun was surprised.

“However, I have already done my research. It was my granddaughter, Long Yao, who was playing a prank. That little clever sprite used some tricks to fool those people from the Ten Thousand Poison Valley,” said the black-robed elder.

Long Yao was a direct descendant of the Dragon Emperor Clan and held a respected status.. She had left the Dragon Emperor Clan on her own accord and gone to a mysterious place to look for her Aunt Jiu.
