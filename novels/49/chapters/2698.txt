Chapter 2699: The Truth About The Destruction (2)

“Zhang Chi, what do you know? You’re just making assumptions. You’re behaving like Senior Brother Lan Shan now.” Another disciple from the Great Immortal Temple scolded him with a smirk.

Wan Rong immediately glanced at that disciple and said, “You probably don’t know Junior Brother Zhang Chi’s background.”

“Junior Brother Zhang’s background? What’s his background?”

Wan Rong chuckled. “Zhang Chi is the Imperial Advisor of the Supreme Heavenly Kingdom. He’s famous for his intelligence.”

“Supreme Heavenly Kingdom’s Imperial Advisor…”

Some of the disciples who didn’t know Zhang Chi’s background were surprised.

The Supreme Heavenly Kingdom was the most powerful empire in the Divine Venerate Domain. It was as powerful as a peak supreme faction in the Divine Venerate Domain. Zhang Chi had once been the Imperial Advisor of the Supreme Heavenly Kingdom. From this, it could be seen that Zhang Chi was no ordinary person.

“Senior Sister Wan Rong, that’s all in the past. There’s no need to talk about it now,” Zhang Chi said with a smile.

“Junior Brother Zhang Chi, please explain your earlier statement.” Ye Qingtang looked at Zhang Chi.

Zhang Chi nodded. “Senior Sister Ye Yue is right. The reason that the shopkeeper sent us here might be related to the destruction of the Fourth Domain. Actually, I’d like to hear your opinion.”

Ye Qingtang answered without hesitation, “As everyone knows, almost everything regarding the Fourth Domain has been completely wiped out. However… the opening of the Fourth Domain’s legacy is a huge turning point. And the owner of this legacy has billions of soul bones. I guess that he was very likely the only surviving Immortal Buddha after the Fourth Domain was destroyed.”

“That’s right… Senior Sister Ye Yue, please continue,” Zhang Chi hurriedly said.

“Perhaps after this Immortal Buddha died, he was unwilling to let all the evidence be erased. Therefore, he constructed everything about the Fourth Domain in his own Deity Ocean, including the information about the destruction of the Fourth Domain. He will tell future generations what happened in the Fourth Domain and how it was completely wiped out from this world.” Ye Qingtang shared her thoughts.

“Ha… Senior Sister Ye Yue, no wonder Uncle-Master Absolute Heaven Saint asked you to be the commander of this operation. From the looks of it now, his judgment is extremely accurate. Senior Sister Ye Yue’s analysis is reasonable. You were able to infer so much from so little. It’s admirable,” Zhang Chi said to Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang smiled. Perhaps she was influenced by Ling Yan. She was only speculating according to Ling Yan’s analysis methods. It was a pity that Ling Yan was not here. Otherwise, he would definitely be able to see the truth. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Junior Sister Ye Yue is right. It’s just that there are some missing details. I don’t think there are any survivors. When the Fourth Domain was destroyed, the owner of the legacy might have been severely injured. He used his last bit of strength to escape the Fourth Domain before falling into the Divine Venerate Domain. Otherwise, the owner of the legacy could have told the world what happened in the Fourth Domain. He was about to die and had no choice but to store everything in his Deity Ocean,” said Lan Shan.

“Senior Brother Lan Shan is right.” Ye Qingtang glanced at Lan Shan.

“So we just have to wait and see.” Zhang Chi smiled.

However, as Zhang Chi spoke, several terrifying auras instantly locked onto everyone present.

In the next second, a few golden figures descended from the sky. Without any warning, a huge destructive Buddha palm pressed towards Ye Qingtang.
