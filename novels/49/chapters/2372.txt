Chapter 2373: Let Me Play (3)

It was clear that Xing Rong had never imagined himself losing. No matter what the other party betted on, he would win.

“Boss…” Nangong Lie was feeling very anxious. He was deeply worried that Ye Qing would take out some precious treasure and lose it to Xing Rong. They would just be widening their losses then.

In response, Ye Qingtang silently took out an elixir bottle from her space ring and placed it on the table.

Xing Rong smirked at the bottle.

“Teacher, your students have already given me plenty of elixirs. I don’t think that this…”

“Nine Melody Spirit Elixir,” Ye Qingtang stated.

Everyone at present was stunned.

“What… what did you say?” The smile on Xing Rong’s face was fading.

“There is one Nine Melody Spirit Elixir inside. Premium quality. If you don’t believe me, you can get anyone you want to verify it.” Ye Qingtang’s face was calm.

Nine Melody Spirit Elixir?

Premium quality? Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The crowd gasped!

The Nine Melody Spirit Elixir was a Grand Master level elixir. They had never even seen this type of elixir before. The various factions would fight tooth and nail over a single pill.

But now…

This person said this bottle contained a Nine Melody Spirit Elixir?!

Was he joking?

A genuine Grand Master-level elixir could be thrown around like common dirt?

“Teacher, are you joking?” Xing Rong suddenly felt that this Netherworld Academy teacher might be an insane person.

“I said that you can get anyone you want to verify it,” Ye Qingtang repeated.

Seeing Ye Qingtang so confident, Xing Rong couldn’t help recalling that the Netherworld Academy had once produced that Grand Master alchemist. So it was not that far-fetched for the Netherworld Academy to have Grand Master-level elixirs.

But just in case, Xing Rong immediately summoned a few medicine faculty students from his academy over.

After their examination, they verified that the bottle did contain a Nine Melody Spirit Elixir.

And a premium quality one at that!

Xing Rong’s blood surged. He had been happy enough just toying with those Netherworld Academy fools and winning some inconsequential items. He never expected to snag such a wonderful prize!

The Nine Melody Spirit Elixir was a truly priceless treasure!

“Alright! I will accept this bet!” Worried that Ye Qingtang might have second thoughts, Xing Rong immediately accepted.

The Netherworld Academy students were foolish, and their teacher was even more so. A Grand Master-level elixir of this grade, they could have just used it to directly exchange for a spirit jade.

Xing Rong was secretly smug. He instinctively glanced up to enjoy the desperate expressions on Lei Yan and his gang.

But Xing Rong was shocked by what he saw.

Their anxious faces relaxed after seeing Ye Qing take out that Nine Melody Spirit Elixir.

“…”

Were those guys right in the head?

Didn’t they know how valuable this Grand Master-level elixir was?

How could they possibly not know?

But…

“I was nearly scared to death. I was so worried about what Boss was going to bet on. Luckily, it’s just some elixir…” Lei Yan heaved a sigh of relief as he patted his chest.

Yun Chen also relaxed.

“Luckily, just an elixir.”

Xing Rong, “…”

What a bunch of idiots!

Just an elixir?

This was a Grand Master-level elixir!

Those guys had mush for brains!

Xing Rong felt that all Netherworld Academy people were truly not right in the head. He didn’t know that if Ye Qing had taken out any other item, the hearts of Lei Yan and the others would ache dearly for him. But elixirs…

If there was one thing in the world which their Boss had in abundance, it was elixirs.

Grand Master-level elixirs?

They ate them like candy.

Were they very rare?
