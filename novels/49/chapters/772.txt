Chapter 773 Peerless School (2)

“Senior brother? Who are those two people? Why are… Warden Xiong and the other wardens following beside them, and why do they look like they are pleasing them?” A disciple who just entered the valley not long ago looked in confusion at the two young men who were being escorted by a group of people.

“Lower your voice.” His senior brother hurriedly warned him and said softly. “Those two people are from the Peerless School.”

“Peerless School? The rumored Peerless School where all the top powerful figures are gathered in?” That disciple’s face was filled with astonishment.

“Since you know it, you must be more careful. Not mentioning wardens, even our Falling Sky Valley elders have to show utmost deference to the Peerless School disciples.”

The disciple shuddered with fear. He originally thought that he had entered a super force after he entered Falling Sky Valley, but unexpectedly…

Falling Sky Valley had to be this cautious before the Peerless School.

As the two of them were discussing softly, a Peerless School disciple suddenly frowned. His sharp gaze passed through the crowd and swept towards the two disciples who were mumbling softly. “Who is commenting on my Peerless School?” A Peerless School disciple shouted coldly.

The Falling Sky Valley wardens broke out in cold sweat immediately.

The people around those two Falling Sky Valley disciples dispersed like birds instantly, leaving those two horrified disciples at the same spot.

“This is how Falling Sky Valley teaches its disciples?” The older-looking Peerless School disciple looked coldly at the wardens beside him.

Xiong Feng and the rest were dripping with cold sweat. They looked at the two dumbstruck Falling Sky Valley disciples and berated immediately. “How insolent! Who gave you the nerves to comment on the Peerless School? Get lost and go receive your punishments!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The two disciples trembled and retreated silently.

However…

“Wait.” A Peerless School disciple suddenly spoke.

The wardens’ face stiffened, unclear of the other party’s intention.

Those two disciples were pale from the shock, and they remained rooted to the ground, not daring to move.

The Peerless School disciple looked at those two disciples. “Anyone who dares to casually comment about my Peerless School will naturally have to be punished.”

“Yes, yes, yes. This is a must. We will let them go to the Disciplinary Hall to be punished.” Xiong Feng agreed with them.

“Don’t trouble.” The Peerless School disciple nodded, and a faint murderous air emerged in his eyes.

In the next second, he suddenly raised his hand, and a golden ray of light immediately shot out from his palm.

In just an instant, that golden light was shot towards one of the two Falling Sky Valley disciples and pierced through the person’s glabella once the golden light touched him.

A streak of blood spurted out from that disciple’s glabella!

Without a wail, that disciple collapsed on the ground with a thud, and the horror on his face was still frozen even when he died.

“Ah!!” Seeing his own senior brother dying in front of him, that disciple who just entered the valley fell to the ground in shock.

Until this moment, he still had not realized what wrong had they done exactly and why his life was taken.

A faint smell of blood spread in the air at that moment.

The Falling Sky Valley disciples watched that instant death in disbelief.

They heard the discussion of those two disciples as well. However, those two disciples only said a few things secretly, and there was no criticism about the Peerless School at all.

But this… was enough for them to lose their lives?!
