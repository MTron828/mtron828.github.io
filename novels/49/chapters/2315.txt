Chapter 2316: Masochist (5)

“Bang!” Still holding Qin Xuan by the head, Qin Feng smashed Qin Xuan’s forehead onto the ground in front of Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang, “…”

To think that this brat was so violent?

But…

She liked it.

He was indeed her student.

Qin Feng remained expressionless. He just continued to grip Qin Xuan’s head tightly as he forced him to kowtow repeatedly to Ye Qing.

The dull thud echoed across the arena.

Qin Xuan’s forehead was already smeared in fresh blood but Qin Feng had no intention of stopping. All the students who were watching this scene subconsciously swallowed hard.

My goodness!

What kind of demons had Ye Qing produced?

Each was more fearsome than the previous one.

How many had there been now?

Five Divine Lord stage practitioners?!

And one of them was a First Heaven peak level.

On top of that, all five of them had been useless garbage who had nearly been kicked out of the Netherworld Academy. But under Ye Qing’s wing, in just a few months they were all now standing at the pinnacle of the academy.

No one knew, but at this moment, everyone was looking at Ye Qing with renewed eyes full of awe and respect.

No matter how low Ye Qing’s cultivation level was, his teaching ability alone was enough to gain the admiration of all the students. All those who had once mocked Qin Feng and the rest for being under a useless teacher, a random notion suddenly surfaced in their minds.

If they had been the ones under Ye Qing…

Wouldn’t they also have had the chance to ascend to the Divine Lord stage?

“What kind of background does this Teacher Ye have? How did he manage to produce such miraculous results?” Gong Jinyun scratched his forehead.

“Why weren’t we as lucky… to have been assigned a teacher like this…” Hang Wenwei lamented. Before he could complete his sentence, he noticed his own teacher glaring at him.

Hang Wenwei immediately shut up and smiled humbly at his teacher. But that notion continued to sprout in his mind.

He also wanted to become a true Divine Lord stage practitioner…

Damn.

The students were not the only ones. Even the teachers who had come to watch the matches all held conflicted expressions. After all, they had come to scoff at this teacher whom they believed was not worthy of joining the Netherworld Academy.

But…

Now, they did not dare to utter a single word.

What was there to say?

This teacher had only been here a few months and was able to produce five Divine Lord stage students.

Who would dare to scoff at someone like that?

Wouldn’t they just be asking for it?

At this thought, the teachers instinctively glanced up at Di Nuo and Gu Wei, who were standing on the high stage.

How much effort had Gu Wei wasted on Qin Feng? In the end, he had chosen to toss Qin Feng aside after his decline, and turned around to mentor Qin Xuan instead…

And now, Qin Xuan had been beaten to a pulp by Qin Feng right in front of everyone.

Dismay probably would not even touch on the emotions Gu Wei must be feeling right now.

As for Di Nuo…

The crowd recalled the bet between Di Nuo and Ye Qing. They gave an inward sigh, secretly relieved that although they had also looked down on Ye Qing, they did not interact much with the teacher and did not bear any major grudge against him.

But for Di Nuo, he was the one who had announced the bet. Now only the medicine faculty’s Yun Chen remained.

Di Nuo’s face was now as black as the underside of a burnt pot. Gu Wei’s expression was even more conflicted. He looked on as Qin Feng smashed Qin Xuan’s head into a bloody mess before he finally spoke up in a deep voice, “Qin Feng, stop.”

Hearing Gu Wei’s voice, Qin Feng paused.
