Chapter 2707: Battle For The Heavenly Dao (2)

However, Ye Qingtang could not figure out how the red symbol between her brows was related to that black shadow. Everything here was just a memory…

Before Ye Qingtang could think further, angry roars erupted in the air.

When she looked up, she was shocked.

At that moment, an azure dragon with a body big enough to blot out the sun was hovering in the sky. Meanwhile, the Silver Star Holy Lord was standing on the back of that dragon.

A huge white tiger was also standing in mid-air beside the azure dragon. The High Monk stood on the back of the white tiger.

“Fiendcelestial Beasts.”

The black shadow smiled coldly.

“Fiendcelestial Beasts… of this level have not appeared in many eras. What level has the Silver Star Holy Lord and High Monk reached? One can control an azure dragon while the other can control a white tiger…” Zhang Chi was shocked.

Ye Qingtang looked at the white tiger and her heart skipped a beat. The aura of the white tiger was overwhelming but still very similar to the aura of her little white tiger.

If not for the fact that the white tiger’s body was too huge and its appearance too ferocious and terrifying, Ye Qingtang might have mistaken it for the little white tiger.

“Could this be the little white tiger’s… father?” Ye Qingtang muttered.

The little white tiger seldom talked about its father and only mentioned it a few times. Therefore, Ye Qingtang was not very clear about the White Tiger Clan. She only knew that the current White Tiger Clan was in dire straits.

The sky darkened during this battle. Mountains and rivers shattered as heaven and earth reversed. The only sounds that could be heard were the intense clash of divine power and the roars of the white tiger and azure dragon.

The entire space was shattered. All that could be seen was endless darkness without any light.

As for the other powerful beings led by the Silver Star Holy Lord and High Monk, they had already fallen right at the very beginning of the battle. The current battle had already exceeded the limits of human comprehension.

In the blink of an eye, heaven and earth shattered and everything was incinerated.

“Boom!”

A loud bang exploded in the air. Ye Qingtang saw that the High Monk was exhausted from the battle. He clasped his hands together and a huge lotus flower pattern appeared around him.

“Silver Star Holy Lord, please ensure that your soul remains intact. Wait for your reincarnation.”

The white tiger was covered in injuries. It let out a painful wail.

“Go on.”

The High Monk raised his right arm and sent the white tiger away. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Unfortunately, the Heaven-Devouring Beast Clan will never let this matter rest… this battle has implicated the white tiger and azure dragon… we have sinned…”

The High Monk let out a sigh. His body gradually shattered, leaving behind a snow-white lotus seed that disappeared into the void.

The fall of the High Monk…

The Silver Star Holy Lord was also severely injured. However, he did not show any signs of retreating.

Looking at the black shadow again, it seemed that it had not used its full strength at all. Against the great Silver Star Holy Lord and High Monk, it executed every move with ease. It even forced the High Monk to preserve his soul and reincarnate before his body dissipated.

“Too powerful… they’re not on the same level at all. It’s impossible to win… just what kind of existence is that black shadow? It’s so terrifying!” Lan Shan gasped. All of this had surpassed Lan Shan’s understanding of the world. Even a god could not have reached such a level!
