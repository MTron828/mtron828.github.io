Chapter 1704: Top Beauty Rankings (3)

“That’s easy. We have quite a number of people here at present. Why don’t we just take a vote now?” Someone suddenly piped up and several others immediately voiced out their support.

“Damn, this sounds like a scam!!” Jiang Yisheng was enraged. It was clearly one of the Mu family youths who had suggested a fresh vote.

“I pointed out just now how weird it was that Mu Ruxue is so confident. So that’s why. It’s because she already prepared this little scheme. I think she must have known she had lost, and so she secretly got someone to steal the votes. She dressed up so splendidly today just waiting for this moment.” Jiang Yiran smacked his own forehead. He was speechless by the lengths Mu Ruxue would go to just to get the top beauty accolade.

Jiang Yiran scanned the crowd and discovered that most of the people at present belonged to the Mu and the Baili families. The rest were all disciples who were on friendly terms with the two families as well. He immediately realized that things were not looking good for them.

This had clearly been orchestrated by Mu Ruxue.

Previously, the rankings had been publicly updated every day and the final results were more or less confirmed. Those who were placed at the bottom would naturally have no interest in coming to watch the final announcement. The other members of their own clans were also not interested in attending.

“No wonder there are so many people here today. I suspect Mu Ruxue must have made them come.” Jiang Yiran gritted his teeth. Apart from the 20 or so customers who were here for lunch, the rest of the crowd were all Mu Ruxue’s people!

Mu Ruxue would definitely get first place if they put it to a vote now.

“Girl, just wait. I’ll go get our friends here now!” Jiang Yiran was very angry and regretted the fact that he hadn’t thought of calling the others over in the first place.

“Never mind. I don’t care about this top beauty ranking anyway,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Do you really not care or are you just finding an excuse because you are not as beautiful as me?” Mu Ruxue asked sarcastically when she overheard Ye Qingtang’s words.

“Mu Ruxue, you are so despicable. You clearly cheated!” Jiang Yisheng scolded her.

“I cheated? What a joke. What proof do you have that I cheated? Even if we carry out a fresh vote, it will be done right here and now. If Ye Qingtang is truly confident of her own looks, she won’t be afraid of having a fresh vote, right?” Mu Ruxue folded her arms smugly across her chest.

Ugh! Jiang Yisheng ground his teeth so hard he felt he could taste blood. But Jiang Yiran just dashed out the door, all prepared to summon the other members of the Jiang family.

Mu Ruxue chuckled at Jiang Yiran’s disappearing profile. “It won’t mean anything even if you get all the people from the Jiang family over. The audience’s eyes are bright and clear. They can easily tell beauty from ugliness.”

With that, Mu Ruxue turned and walked off.

Just based on Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo’s high standing, plenty of youths from the other clans were willing to vote for Mu Ruxue just to maintain good relations. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

As for Ye Qingtang, there were at most 20 people from the Jiang family. It was far from enough to beat the number of people on Mu Ruxue’s side.

The new voting soon started. As commanded by Mu Ruxue, those people wrote her name on their votes.

Only those customers who were there purely for lunch—they felt that Ye Qingtang was truly more beautiful and so wrote her name. But those few customers were just a drop in the bucket.

The restaurant servant counted the votes and Mu Ruxue was the clear winner.

“It seems like a certain person’s appearance is just ordinary and common.” Mu Ruxue smirked.

The provocation had Jiang Yisheng jumping in rage. He was itching to toss in a hundred votes himself!

In his life he had seen plenty of shameless people, but none of them were as shameless as Mu Ruxue.
