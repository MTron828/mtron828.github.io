Chapter 2670 I Don’t Like It (3)

“Miss Ye… You don’t like me doing this?” Ling Yan stared at Ye Qingtang thoughtfully.

“I don’t like it… Ling Yan, I don’t agree with you doing this. Let’s not talk about the other me, Sister Ah Yao treats me like her own sister. Even though we just met, she was willing to sacrifice her life to help me. She even thought that I was her biological sister. You want me to scheme with you against Sister Ah Yao and have her die 10,000 years earlier. Sorry, I just can’t do that!” Ye Qingtang’s tone was extremely determined.

What was the thing in her heart all these

years?

The only thing that kept her going was that her life was in her own hands. She never believed in some bullshit predestination. She only knew… that her life was in her own hands… and not the heavens!

It did not matter if it was a fate that had been predestined since birth or if she was just a pawn that was born to fulfill some destiny… all of these were not decided by the heavens!

She was the one who decided!

She should get to decide her own life.

“Miss Ye, do you think I’m heartless?” Ling Yan asked softly.

Without giving Ye Qingtang a chance to speak, Ling Yan smiled. “What has the lives of others got to do with me? As long as Miss Ye is fine, the lives of others are naturally worth it. To me, everything in this world and even the world itself can be treated as a pawn, but not Miss Ye.”

Ye Qingtang, “…” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Forget it. Since Miss Ye doesn’t like my way of doing things, I won’t do it.” Ling Yan suddenly changed his tune.

“Really?” Ye Qingtang looked at Ling Yan in surprise.

“I always keep my word.” Ling Yan smiled.

“But this is your only chance. If you let this go, there will only be one final method in the future.” Ling Yan looked up into the sky.

“Get the big yellow dog to help?” Ye Qingtang looked at the huge yellow dog that was still chewing on the sun in the distance. Even after chewing for so long, the sun did not look any smaller…

“I mean to fight with the heavens… is an endless joy.” Ling Yan’s lips curled up slightly.

Ling Yan’s words reminded Ye Qingtang of the Heavenly Emperor. The image of him standing in the sky all those years ago, surrounded by lightning. He had the power to say that it was an endless joy to fight with the heavens…

All along, Ling Yan and the Heavenly Emperor seemed to be two extremes.

The Heavenly Emperor did not fear anything. So what if it was heaven and earth? He would just smile at the heavens with his blade. Even if it was the gods of heaven and earth, he would look down on them.

However, Ling Yan was at a completely different extreme. He treated the world as a chessboard and everything as his chess pieces. He could scheme against everything while hiding in the dark, causing the world to pale and everything to tremble.

Ling Yan never cared for anyone. As long as he could achieve his goal, he could abandon all his pawns. Human lives were just a joke to him.

Ye Qingtang did not expect Ling Yan to give up on his scheme just because of her words.

“Miss Ye, do you like the current me?” Ling Yan smiled at Ye Qingtang.

In all honesty, Ye Qingtang did not know how to respond to Ling Yan’s question. She felt a little flustered.

After some time, Ye Qingtang met Ling Yan’s eyes. She opened her mouth as if she wanted to say something. However, before Ye Qingtang could say anything, an extremely hot light exploded.

“Be careful.”

Ling Yan suddenly pulled Ye Qingtang into his arms before retreating backward.
