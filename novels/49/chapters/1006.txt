Chapter 1007 Reform (1)

Ye Qingtang could recruit all those really powerful people to the Ye Family with her own ability. Why would she need these selfish people here?

The same went for the disciples here. Most of them lived in Lin Town. They changed their surnames to Ye after entering the Ye Family, but they did not belong to direct descendants of the Ye Family.

When Ye Family encountered such troubles, none of them dared to speak out for the family. Instead, they put all the blame onto Ye Qingtang, the family’s Young Lady.

“Hand over all the weapons and elixirs Young Lady gave out previously. You know what will be the consequences if you hide any of them!”

The Third Elder walked into the crowd and commanded coldly.

Soon, around a dozen of yellow-grade weapons and elixirs were taken back by the Third Elder.

“Disperse all disciples of the Ye Family here. None of you will be allowed to call yourself as a disciple of the Ye Family,” Ye Qingtang said indifferently.

“What…”

“On what basis!”

“What did we do?!”

All the disciples of the Ye Family started questioning and complaining when they heard that Ye Qingtang wanted to chase them away.

“Because none of you deserve to have my surname. None of you deserve to be a disciple of the Ye Family.” Ye Qingtang scanned through the crowd and said.

The Third Elder could completely understand Ye Qingtang’s intention. If he were Ye Qingtang, he might kill these unrelated disciples directly. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Leave now!” The Third Elder shouted in rage and opened his eyes wide.

The disciples all showed different expressions. They just experienced both joy and desperation in such a short period of time.

They just received all the supreme weapons and elixirs, but then they were taken back. The Ye Family now had a Yang Lord that they could show off in front of others. However, they were chased out of the Ye Family all of a sudden…

The disciples could do nothing but leave.

After the disciples left, Ye Qingtang looked towards the remaining senior members of the Ye Family and said, “Same for you. If anyone dares to use the surname Ye in the future, I will hunt you down no matter where you go.”

“Wh… What?!”

The senior members of the Ye Family were all shocked and could not believe what they just heard. They… they were chased out of the Ye Family by her as well?!

The Ye Family would definitely become a super family with Ye Qingtang. However, they were chased out of the Ye Family before they could even enjoy their good days?!

However, no one dared to say anything to the unconquerable Seventh Heaven Yang Lord.

“Young Lady… It’s hard for the Ye Family to function without the senior members.” The Third Elder looked at Ye Qingtang and said.

Ye Qingtang touched the Third Elder’s forehead gently, and her Divine Sense entered his glabella, “Bring my Divine Sense to recruit those suitable powerful people to the Ye Family.”

“Sure!” The Third Elder was very excited as he nodded constantly. Even a Yin Yang Perfected Lord would fight to join the Ye Family with a Seventh Heaven Yang Lord’s Divine Sense!

“Young Lady, I will set off soon after some preparation!” The Third Elder turned and left after finishing his words.

Now, only a few people still remained in the giant Ye Family.

Ye Ling finally understood the situation and realized that his daughter Ye Qingtang was now a Yang Lord!

“Tang Tang… Am I dreaming?!” Ye Ling could not believe how Ye Qingtang managed to become a Yang Lord within two years.

“Father, no one will dare to bully us from today onward.” Ye Qingtang smiled gently to Ye Ling.
