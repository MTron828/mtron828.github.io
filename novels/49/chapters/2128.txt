Chapter 2129: Netherworld Academy (5)

After all, only by passing this admission test would they be able to officially become students of the Netherworld Academy.

Ye Qingtang and Di Nuo arrived at another entrance at the academy. It was empty, unlike the previous teeming crowds.

“You need to come here if you wish to apply to be a teacher,” Di Nuo said in a solemn voice.

“Do you know why there is no one around?”

Ye Qingtang shook her head.

“Because the Netherworld Academy will only accept those who are powerful enough to be teachers. Those who are not powerful enough have no right and no confidence of stepping onto our grounds.” Di Nuo’s tone was mild, with a sliver of arrogance.

Of course, Ye Qingtang heard the underlying sarcasm in Di Nuo’s words, mocking her lack of self-awareness. But she did not care about that. All was fine as long as she could enter the Netherworld Academy to get the Wind-Calming Pearl.

An elder sat in front of a table inside the room. Another middle-aged man was standing at the side discussing something with him.

“Vice-President, this cultivation method can strengthen one’s foundations but it is no longer suitable for people above the age of 15 to practice,” said the middle-aged man.

“This cultivation method was created by a Great Nascent cultivator and has been passed down for many years. But it has always been practiced by children below the age of 10, to establish their foundations. Although there are benefits to this cultivation method, it is no longer suitable for our students at this age...”

As they continued their discussion, they suddenly heard footsteps. The middle-aged man lifted his head and saw Di Nuo with Ye Qingtang following behind. Astonishment flashed across his eyes.

“Di Nuo, this is...?”

“Teacher Luo, this person wants to apply to be a teacher at our Netherworld Academy,” Di Nuo replied. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Teacher Luo was taken aback. He stared at Ye Qingtang with obvious shock. With his abilities, he could naturally sense Ye Qingtang’s cultivation level. At this level, there was no way she could even become a student, much less a teacher.

“Is this a joke? We are discussing cultivation methods and have no time to humor people like that. Please have him leave immediately,” Teacher Luo spoke up impatiently.

The elder in front of the table didn’t even lift his head. He continued to study the remnants of a book on the table.

Di Nuo turned to look at Ye Qingtang, indicating that she could get lost now.

Since Ye Qingtang managed to make her way in, there was no way she would give up on her goal to enter the Netherworld Academy. Scanning her eyes across the table, she saw that there were many cultivation books on the table. Before Di Nuo managed to chase her away, she hastily spoke up.

“You are studying the Dorot Cultivation Method?”

The middle-aged man was taken aback by Ye Qingtang’s words and he frowned.

“That’s right.”

“The Dorot Cultivation Method was created by a Great Nascent cultivator. But he only left behind an incomplete book and so this cultivation method is only suitable for those aged 10 and below. No one is able to continue practicing this beyond that age.”

The middle-aged man and Di Nuo stared at Ye Qingtang. They felt that she was just speaking nonsense.

Who the hell didn’t know that the Dorot Cultivation Method was only meant for children?

“Actually, it is possible for those above the age of 10 to practice this. But they would have to make adjustments. For practitioners below the age of 10, they can use this method to train the physical body. But in reality, the Dorot Cultivation Method is meant for internal cultivation. You just need to find out how to adjust it for internal cultivation. Once you do, you will no longer be restricted by age,” Ye Qingtang explained.
