Chapter 1972: Male Pet (1)

The Holy Lord of Shadows’s room was forbidden ground in the Temple of Shadows. Only the two Holy Sons were allowed to enter and even Xue Fu and the rest of them were not allowed to step in.

This had been on the Holy Lord’s strict orders.

But they had seen with their own eyes the Holy Lord pulling a human man into her room.

And she had been so rough with him!

Xue Fu’s lips twitched. “Do not speak of this.”

The Undead Clan members all shut their mouths and lowered their gazes.

Although Xue Fu looked calm on the surface, inside he was crawling with excitement. After making arrangements for the patrol to leave, he quickly ran over to Ming Wang to report on his findings.

Ming Wang’s frozen face which had not changed for thousands of years showed surprise as he heard the news. Even the eight tribe leaders who had been discussing matters with him couldn’t help but widen their eyes.

The Holy Lord’s room...

Even they had never been inside before.

“Where is this human from?” the Goblin Tribe leader asked, bursting with curiosity.

“I think he’s the Emperor of the Eternal Dynasty, Ling Yan,” Xue Fu said.

“So... it’s him...” the Goblin Tribe leader said ambiguously.

“Hm? You know him?” the Demon Tribe asked in surprise. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The Goblin Tribe leader laughed darkly and said, “How could I not know him? We at the Temple of Shadows had already chosen a successor from the Eternal Dynasty but that person was later abandoned by the Holy Lord of Shadows, who chose to support this Ling Yan instead. This led to so much conflict with the people at the Sacred Ground of Reflection.”

“I’ve heard that even though Ling Yan isn’t strong, he is extremely intelligent and handsome...”

“Hmph, you call that handsome? I’m the one you should be calling handsome! You have no taste.” The Demon Tribe leader scoffed and licked his face as he patted his strong biceps.

“How are those weak arms any good to look at?”

“You may think that he’s ugly but the Holy Lord thinks that he’s handsome. You know that the Holy Lord’s taste is different from ours,” The Goblin Tribe leader said coldly.

Left speechless, everyone fell silent.

When the Holy Lord of Shadows had first appeared in her human form, the Undead Clan had thought that she was enduring the humiliation to gain a foothold in the Central Mainland.

It must have been so hard to keep that ugly appearance the entire day!

“What do you mean by that? Are you saying... the Holy Lord and this little rascal Ling Yan...” The Goblin Tribe Leader seemed to be implying something.

“The Holy Lord is still a female after all, and she hasn’t had an Emperor by her side all these years...” The Goblin Tribe Leader left the rest unsaid.

The other tribe leaders seemed to understand what he was implying. They looked at each other and smiled wretchedly.

Ming Wang’s face darkened but he remained silent.

“Even if she wanted an Emperor, he shouldn’t be someone like this... I remember when Holy Lord was in the Crimson League... he would’ve been a nobody to her...” the Demon Tribe Leader seemed to want to say something else but held himself back.

The Goblin Tribe Leader said, “No one can force the Holy Lord to do anything she doesn’t like. Who knows, our Holy Lord may have strange tastes. She may not only like aliens. Furthermore, I never said that he would become the Emperor. Don’t the humans have a word for this?”

“A male pet!”

...

Meanwhile, the “male pet” in question, Ling Yan, was dragged into Ye Qingtang’s room. Before he even had a chance to regain his footing, he was thrown to the side.
