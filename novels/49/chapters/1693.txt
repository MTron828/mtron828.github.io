Chapter 1694: The Fourth Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate Realm (1)

There was no doubt that Baili Xuanyun was powerful. But Ye Qingtang’s nonchalant dismissal of his speech made him appear long-winded and naggy.

“This Ye Qingtang is quite interesting. I’ve never actually paid much attention to her. She is probably not that powerful, but she is not at all afraid of Baili Xuanyun. Either she is a fool or she has gone crazy...” Zhan Rao guffawed with his arms across his chest.

Sang Feiyu glanced at him. She felt that he was just stating the obvious.

“The disparity between the two of them is just too great. Even Jiang Yanyun has already been defeated, and Ye Qingtang had no choice but to choose Baili Xuanyun. Otherwise, why do you think she decided to challenge Baili Xuanyun?”

“It looks like the current generation of the Jiang family is pretty sub-standard.” Zhan Rao shrugged.

It was obvious that the crowd were not that interested in the fight between Ye Qingtang and Baili Xuanyun. In their opinion, the results of the competition were already fixed. What was the point in watching it?

Baili Xuanyun clearly felt the same. He smirked as he gazed at the foolish Ye Qingtang.

“Since you are so eager to die, I will help you.” Standing with his hands clasped behind his back, Baili Xuanyun lifted his chin but didn’t make any move to draw his sword. He stared at Ye Qingtang with unmasked scorn.

“Let’s not have others say that I am bullying you. I will not use any weapon in today’s battle. I will also let you make the first move.”

The arrogance in his tone was haughty and filled with contempt. Yet the way Baili Xuanyun made his offer was as if he was truly being gracious and benevolent.

As they stood before the various clans, everyone felt that his offer showed his low opinion of Ye Qingtang. He could not have been more scornful and mocking.

The crowd started discussing the fight, their conversations full of ridicule and sarcasm. It was clear that they thought that this battle was a joke.

Meanwhile, Ye Qingtang was oblivious to her surroundings. As Baili Xuanyun raised his brows in a challenging manner, Ye Qingtang suddenly shut her eyes.

“Eh? What happened?” The crowd, who was expecting the match to end quickly, suddenly realized that Ye Qingtang had actually closed her eyes right when the fight started. She seemed to have no intention of attacking Baili Xuanyun.

“What is Ye Qingtang trying to do? Is it because she knows she is no match for Baili Xuanyun, and has resigned herself to her fate?”

“Damn, she is truly shameless. Didn’t you hear what Baili Xuanyun said earlier? He was going to let Ye Qingtang make the first move? If Ye Qingtang doesn’t strike first, Baili Xuanyun can’t strike either. That Ye Qingtang is really shameless.”

“Are members of the Jiang family such sore losers?”

The crowd couldn’t help murmuring as they watched Ye Qingtang, who was standing motionless in the arena with her eyes closed.

Elder Qian and the rest couldn’t help frowning.

Although they knew that Ye Qingtang was no match for Baili Xuanyun, she represented the Jiang family the moment she stepped into the arena. If she was going to stoop to such cheap tricks, this would only add to the embarrassment of the Jiang family!

From his position opposite her, Baili Xuanyun was in no hurry. He was very pleased at how the crowd was mocking Ye Qingtang and he didn’t mind playing along with Ye Qingtang for the moment. Anyway, she was just embarrassing herself and the Jiang family so what did it matter?

But just as everyone thought Ye Qingtang was just trying to stall for time, she suddenly opened her eyes again.

A harsh light flashed past Ye Qingtang’s eyes as a hazy black spirit energy suddenly enveloped her entire body!Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎
