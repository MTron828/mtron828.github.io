Chapter 1577 Cultivation 5

The Jiang Family had countless extraordinary talents, but those who could stand at the tip of the pyramid could be counted.Jiang Shaobai and Jiang Yanyun were one of those few people. Furthermore, Jiang Yanyun was currently the most formidable junior in Taiyuan Valley; some elders even may not win against him in a spar.

Ever since Jiang Shaobai and Jiang Yanyun met, they were on unfriendly terms, and the youths on both sides had been fighting both openly and covertly for a long time. The Martial Arts Championship spot was one of the targets of their competition.

Although the number of spots available for the Martial Arts Championship was still unknown, tension had already begun filling the air.

...

On the other side, Ye Qingtang headed to the Jiang Family’s sacred ground. It was the deepest corner of Taiyuan Valley where a mountain range split the boundless valley into five canyons.

A Jiang Family warden guarding outside the canyon was recording something with his head lowered and only looked up when he felt someone getting close. His eyes subsequently landed on the alluring girl who carried a little white tiger in her arms.

“Hello. I wish to enter the sacred grounds to cultivate. May I know what rules there are?” Ye Qingtang asked.

The warden glanced at Ye Qingtang and found her to be extremely foreign. Then, he recalled the rumor of the Domain Monarch Founder’s return. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

He seemed to have heard that the Domain Monarch Founder brought a Jiang Family junior back to train with great care. However, that junior was found to lack endowment after the test, so the Domain Monarch Founder lost his patience and left without caring about her anymore.

When the Domain Monarch Founder left Taiyuan Valley, only a few elders and juniors were present, and everyone had a tacit agreement to keep mum about the reason behind his departure. Rather, those who were unaware falsely assumed that the Domain Monarch Founder was dissatisfied over a lacking junior who he chose and thus left to not waste any time.

The warden did not speak and merely raised his hand and tapped the golden tablet at the entrance, signaling Ye Qingtang to look at it herself.

The Taiyuan Valley sacred ground was split into five canyons, namely the Gong, Shang, Jiao, Zheng, and Yu canyons.

The cultivation effects became more obvious and prominent in that sequential order.

A day of cultivation in the Gong Canyon was equivalent to ten days outside.

A day of cultivation in the Shang Canyon was equivalent to twenty days outside.

Following this pattern, a day of cultivation in the Yu Canyon was equivalent to fifty days outside...

However, the closer to the end of the sequence, the larger the number of honor points required for that canyon.

A day of cultivation in just the Gong Canyon required two thousand honor points while the Yu canyon required ten thousand honor points...

Ye Qingtang had a total of ten thousand honor points, and if she used them in the Yu Canyon, she would have to leave after a day.

Apart from increasing the cultivation speed, the spirit energy in the different canyons had different refinement effects on the body; the closer to the end of the sequence, the better the effects of the canyon.

Ye Qingtang weighed her options and ultimately decided on the Gong Canyon.

Her current realm was not high, and there was a limit to the amount of spirit energy she could absorb. If she went to the Yu Canyon, the one-day duration would probably be wasted.

“I want to enter the Gong Canyon for five days.” Ye Qingtang handed in the honor points to exchange for a chance to cultivate in the Gong Canyon for five days and was immediately led into the Gong Canyon by the warden.

Right after Ye Qingtang entered, two youths who were approaching the sacred grounds noticed the back view of Ye Qingtang entering Gong Canyon.

“Isn’t that the girl that has always been beside Jiang Shaobai recently?” A youth squinted his eyes and said.

“Jiang Shaobai has such great innate talent, but god knows what she is thinking to actually waste time on that girl. I think she can forget about reaching Brother Yanyun’s realm in this lifetime.” Another youth sneered.
