Chapter 1277: Slaves (3)

“Young Master, these Undead appeared from nowhere and dared to strike us.” A foreman hurriedly explained.

An impatient look crossed the youth’s face when he heard that. He raised his eyes, but what he saw caused a malicious look to instantly flash across his eyes.

“What beautiful Undead.”

The youth glanced at Ye Qingtang and Lady Ghost with an expression of surprise.

This youth’s name was Long Yang, and he was a cousin of the Long Family Master.

The Long Family was a famous family in this mainland. It controlled many mines and had many connections among the dynasties. The Long Family had also enslaved many Undead.

Long Yang had seen many Undead before, but this was the first time seeing such beautiful ones.

The Undead enslaved by the Long Family received a jolt when they saw that Long Yang had arrived. A few of the Undead who were near Ye Qingtang whispered. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Clansman, thank you for your help today. But the Long Family is not to be trifled with. You’d better leave.”

The Long Family was extremely powerful and had captured many Undead. Those who tried to escape were all executed by the Long Family. They were grateful to these three clansmen for their help, so they were unwilling to see more of their clansmen suffer at the hands of the Long Family.

Ye Qingtang looked at the worried Undead, and a trace of amusement surfaced in her eyes.

Many Undead had settled in Central Mainland. Most of them had led comfortable lives and, like the other inhabitants of the mainland, did not look for trouble.

But the special characteristics of their race had caused their suffering.

Ye Qingtang did not leave. She only raised her eyes to look at the malicious-looking Long Yang.

“You are certainly very bold. Do you know who controls this area? How dare you be so presumptuous.” Long Yang smiled at Ye Qingtang and Lady Ghost with a greedy look in his eyes.

“Men, capture these three Undead. Put the small one to work. As for the two female Undead… send them to my room. I have not had a taste of such beautiful Undead.” Long Yang smiled sinisterly.

At Long Yang’s command, the foremen and their henchmen charged at Ye Qingtang and the others.

The enslaved Undead were shocked when they saw that their clansmen were about to be mistreated. They almost subconsciously blocked the men’s way.

An elderly Undead hurriedly said to Ye Qingtang, “Clansmen, please leave quickly. The Long Family is not to be trifled with. If you are caught, there will be no hope of escape.”

They could not escape, but they also could not look on and see their clansmen, who had helped them, get into trouble.

A large group of Undead slaves tried to intercept the men from the Long Family. However, they were unarmed and only succeeded in bringing on a whipping.

Tragic screams rang out.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes immediately turned icy.

These humans in Central Mainland all looked down on the Undead Clan. They thought that the Undead Clan was cruel and cold-blooded, but they did not see that the ties between the Undead and their clansmen were no less than that of the other races.

“Ming Gu,” Ye Qingtang said softly while remaining expressionless.

The moment Ye Qingtang spoke, Ming Gu, who was already feeling fed up, immediately transformed into a black shadow.
