Chapter 907 It’s You Whom I Am Hitting (8)

“Oh right, Ling Yan wanted me to tell you… There is his Blood of Karma on the Heavenly Demon Pearl. If you meet with danger, you can use the Heavenly Demon Pearl.” The little white tiger suddenly crawled out of Ye Qingtang’s arms.

“Blood of Karma…”

Ye Qingtang was shocked. Every drop of the Blood of Karma was extremely important to Ling Yan…

There were two types of blood in Ling Yan’s body: the first was the ordinary blood while the second was the Blood of Karma.

The virtual image shot a deadly glare at Ye Qingtang. This girl could actually withstand his

aura…

“Grandfather, quickly kill her!” Feng Wuya shouted in panic.

Everyone here had already thrown up blood but not this woman!

“Tear the talisman. It is sealed with one strike from me,” the virtual image said.

Upon hearing the virtual image’s words, Feng Wuya nodded repeatedly.

“One strike from a Heavenly Venerate?!”

Everyone was astonished.

That golden talisman was definitely some kind of treasure that could seal a powerful strike of a Heavenly Venerate. If that was really the case, the sealed strike was not in any way weakened because it was already sealed a long time ago and would not be affected by the spirit energy on this mainland. That would be a true strike of a Heavenly Venerate!

Even if Ye Qingtang was also a Heavenly Venerate, her martial realm was repressed currently, and it was impossible for her to withstand a strike from a Heavenly Venerate!

“Haha, even if you are a Heavenly Venerate, you will die without a doubt after sustaining one strike from my grandfather!”

Feng Wuya laughed coldly, as though he had already forgotten about the pain in his broken left arm, and he immediately tore up the golden talisman.

Just as the golden talisman was torn apart, the weather changed drastically, and the ground tremored. It was as though Heaven and Earth were reversed in that instant.

Everyone’s bodies were about to be ripped into pieces. There was agony and terror in the deepest corners of their hearts

Swoosh!

In a flash, a bolt of light shot towards Ye Qingtang.

No one could see the color or trace of this bolt of light. It was as if eternity penetrated the breath of destruction into this mainland.

Nevertheless, Ye Qingtang’s expression remained the same in the face of a strike from a Heavenly Venerate. She immediately transferred out all of the power of the Heavenly Demon Pearl.

“Roar!”

At that moment, a black virtual image seemed to descend from the sky with the power of karma surrounding the virtual image.

Swiftly, the black virtual image and the bolt of light clashed.

However, what was unbelievable was that the strike from the Heavenly Venerate and that black virtual image disappeared at the same time, and no one knew where they went.

“Karma Diversion?!” The elderly’s eyes flickered continuously as he stared at Ye Qingtang

This lady actually knew about the power of karma and used Karma Diversion to divert the power of his strike away!

At the same time, in a certain corner of the Dragon Vein. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Ling Yan stood beside the grave of the Azure Dragon and was surrounded by dozens of people.

“Ling Yan, you will die without a doubt today!”

“I want to see who can save you!”

The powerful figures from the Central Mainland sneered.

This Ling Yan is such a useless person, but he actually dared to come to this place alone and contend for the inheritance of the True Dragon with us?!

Facing the encirclement of dozens of powerful figures, an unknown smile, however, hung on Ling Yan’s lips. “There’s no hurry to take my life. But before that, I wish to play a game with you all.”

“Game?”

A certain powerful figure was dumbfounded. Presently, Ling Yan was already doomed to die, but he still had the mood to play a game with them… Was he feigning calmness or did he still have a hidden trump card?!
