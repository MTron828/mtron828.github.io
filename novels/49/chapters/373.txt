Song Junqiu slowed down his path and turned to look at Ye Qingtang. “Do you regret your choice now, Junior Sister Ye?”

Ye Qingtang sneered. “Where is Ni Shang?”

Song Junqiu lifted his eyebrows and took a glance at Ye Qingtang. “Ni Shang?”

He then appeared to suddenly remember something and smiled. “Are you talking about your servant girl? Don’t be so nervous. We saw the potential of that girl, and that’s why we brought her away to teach her. If you are concerned, I’ll ask someone to send her back later.”

The other three disciples’ faces changed.

They had yet tasted the girl. How could she be returned to Ye Qingtang so soon?

They were about to speak when Song Junqiu glanced at them, and they had to remain silent.

“Thank you, Senior Brother Song,” Ye Qingtang said.

“You’re welcome.” Song Junqiu replied.

From the start, Song Junqiu was involved because of the grudge between them. Now that Ye Qingtang would face her destiny soon once she stepped onto the Life and Death Ring, Ni Shang was useless to him. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Furthermore, even though some disciples would punish their attendant girls and sword boys in the inner sect, this could not be discussed openly. If the wardens or the Elders found out about that, those disciples would be punished.

They kidnapped Ni Shang previously as Ye Qingtang was not back yet, and Fei Ying would not be able to see the wardens and the Elders as a sword boy. That was why they dared to kidnap her. However, Ye Qingtang was back now. If they still held Ni Shang, she might report the case to the wardens and the Elders. They would face the consequence then.

“Do you have any other things, Junior Sister Ye?” Song Junqiu smiled and asked.

“Nope.”

Song Junqiu smiled and left with the other three disciples.

Fei Ying gritted his teeth as the four people walked away arrogantly.

“Young Lady, you do not need to fight against them on the Life and Death Ring. If we report to the wardens and the Elders that they kidnapped Ni Shang, they will be punished.” Fei Ying felt gracious towards Ye Qingtang for rescuing them, but he was also worried for Ye Qingtang’s safety.

However, Ye Qingtang shook her head insistently.

Ni Shang was just an attendant girl. If they reported the case, Song Junqiu and the rest would only receive light punishments. Furthermore, Song Junqiu had some connections with one of the wardens in the inner sect.

This was not the revenge that Ye Qingtang wanted.

“I will take revenge with my own hands,” Ye Qingtang said and squinted her eyes. How could she let the people who dared to touch her people go?

Fei Ying was in a complex mood as he stared at Ye Qingtang’s face.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder had witnessed the whole situation and figured out the whole story. Based on his understanding of Ye Qingtang, she would use her life to protect her people.

“Their abilities are above yours. Are you sure you are going to fight against them together on the Life and Death Ring?” the Blood Moon Sect Elder said.

Ye Qingtang now was still weaker than the weakest person in the four of them. How could she win?

“You don’t need to worry about this.” Ye Qingtang replied.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder was stunned.

“I would have never cared for you if you did not bribe me with the Bonded Soul Pill. I wish you die as soon as possible.’

Ye Qingtang headed back after signing the Life and Death Agreement.

Not long after Ye Qingtang and Fei Ying returned to their home, Ni Shang was sent back by Song Junqiu’s people.
