Chapter 27: Bent Grass (3)

Three chests filled with glittering gold made their way into the envious eyes of the onlookers.

Ye Qingtang glanced at the gold before she picked some up, piece by piece, a gold nugget the size of her palm, and plonked each down onto the counter displaying the Flora moonstone.

There was a clunk as each gold piece landed on the counter, but Ye Qingtang remained indifferent to that. With squinted eyes, she focused her sight on the grim-looking Duan Tianrui, observing his darkening countenance as every clunk resounded.

“Here’s thirty thousand gold, I’m buying the Flora moonstone.” As the final gold piece totaling thirty thousand landed on the counter, Ye Qingtang made her statement with a subtle smirk on her face, which nearly burst a blood vessel on Duan Tianrui.

Never in his wildest dreams did he anticipate that Ye Qingtang had such a trick up her sleeves.

Even without her coffers, she not only managed to acquire the moonstone, she also made a killing right off the bat!

Regardless of his prudent temper, Duan Tianrui could not help but be infuriated by Ye Qingtang’s provocation.

“I’m sorry, Mr. Duan. We work on a first-come, first-served basis. This Flora moonstone…” The manager, who owed Ye Qingtang a favor over the discovery of the Bent grass, obviously stood by her. He approached Duan Tianrui personally and requested him to return the moonstone, that he had been toying around in his hands.

Duan Tianrui grinded his teeth discreetly and handed over the moonstone, which he initially expected to be in his pocket.

The manager presented the moonstone to Ye Qingtang in front of everyone and announced, “Miss Ye, this Flora moonstone is now yours.”

Ye Qingtang raised an eyebrow and received the moonstone before throwing a glance at Duan Tianrui.

That single glance was enough to drive Duan Tianrui up the wall.

To think he would be the one to end up playing the clown!

“Well, congratulations on your new purchase, Miss Ye. I’ve matters to attend to and shall make a move.” Duan Tianrui bit his lip before conveying his bureaucratic message and went off, accompanied by his attendants, with their tails between their legs.

Everyone was at a loss for words as no one expected this when the curtain falls.

Si Bai, who had been observing from a corner the whole time snickered to himself when he witnessed Ye Qingtang playing Duan Tianrui like a fiddle. He resumed his appraisal on his jade selection without a second thought.

“Miss Ye, if there’s anything else you need, feel free to ask. I’ll excuse myself for the time being.” The manager smiled and offered Ye Qingtang his utmost hospitality.

Ye Qingtang gave a subtle nod, acquiring the Flora moonstone was a pleasant surprise, but there were more important items for her to find.

The manager left the boutique’s lobby and headed straight towards the top floor.

The doors to the loft suite at the top floor were shut tight. The manager straightened his attire before knocking politely on the door.

“May I have your Lordship’s permission to enter?”

“Granted.”

The manager then opened the doors quietly and entered the room. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The charismatic Mu Su was seated by the desk. The manager once having closed the doors behind himself, knelt down in front of Mu Su, while he presented the brocade box containing the Bent grass.

“Your Lordship, we have managed to acquire the Bent grass.”

Mu Su raised his eyebrows and received the box. After checking its contents, there was a contented smile on his face.

Who could have known that the mysterious owner of the Pavilion of Treasures, was none other than the famous Marquis of the City of Luoxing.

“Though this had taken quite a while, but you did well.” Mu Su put down the box before commending the manager for his work.

The manager remained on his knees and responded respectfully, “I thank your Lordship, for your graciousness.”

Mu Su had just arrived in the City of Lin the night before. The manager was shocked by his sudden advent because deep down, he feared his presence. It was a blessing for him to acquire the Bent grass just in time, otherwise, he would not have dared to show himself in front of him.
