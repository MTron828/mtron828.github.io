Chapter 935 The Heart of the Heavenly Dao 2

Ye Qingtang was extremely cooperative and nodded her head in agreement with the Divine Phoenix’s request.

Very quickly, a scarlet glow enveloped Ye Qingtang once again.

“Superior martial gift that is close to top-notch quality… Possession of the Ultimate Origin Skill, Rise of the Phoenix… There is nothing wrong with this. But what exactly is the problem?” The Divine Phoenix could not find an answer no matter how hard it pondered; it was as though the majority of the powers of its inheritance disappeared somewhere.

Very quickly, the scarlet glow intensified, and the Divine Phoenix scanned every area of Ye Qingtang’s body.

“Your bloodline…” A long time later, the Divine Phoenix mumbled with a little surprise.

Apart from its bloodline, the power of a primitive bloodline was actually hidden in Ye Qingtang’s body.

This bloodline had yet to be truly activated, but it was terrifyingly powerful.

“Is this actually the Immortal and Buddha bloodline…”

The Divine Phoenix seemed to be in deep thought before it looked at Ye Qingtang. “Have you ever been to the Fourth Domain?”

“The Fourth Domain?” Ye Qingtang shook her head in reply. “Lord Divine Phoenix, I have never been to the Fourth Domain.”

“Do you know that your body has the Immortal and Buddha bloodline?” The Divine Phoenix asked.

“Immortal and Buddha bloodline?” Ye Qingtang was slightly startled. Why would there be the Immortal and Buddha bloodline in her body?!

“The Immortal and Buddha bloodline is passed down by generations. Unless the person was a descendant of an Immortal and Buddha, it is impossible for anyone to obtain the Immortal and Buddha bloodline through any means. Since you have never been to the Fourth Domain, it should be that either your father or mother possesses the bloodline. After giving birth to you, the bloodline was inherited, and you naturally have this type of bloodline as well.” The Divine Phoenix explained.

“My parents…” Ye Qingtang’s brows were slightly furrowed. She had already investigated in Nine Nights Dynasty, and all the evidence pointed to the fact that her mother once appeared on this mainland. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Moreover, it was extremely likely that her mother was in the Central Mainland or was just a citizen of the Central Mainland.

Yet, presently, the Divine Phoenix personally told her that either her father or mother possessed the Immortal and Buddha bloodline…

“The power of this bloodline is extremely powerful, but it is still inactive. However, the Immortal and Buddha bloodline is about opportunity. Perhaps, it wouldn’t be able to activate in this lifetime. You don’t need to think too much about it.” The Divine Phoenix added.

“I understand,” said Ye Qingtang.

“However…” The Divine Phoenix paused and continued. “Even if you have the Immortal and Buddha bloodline, what has it got to do with the disappearance of most of the bloodline power that I inherited to you…”

Without giving Ye Qingtang a chance to speak, the Divine Phoenix continued to study Ye Qingtang’s body constitution.

About ten breaths later, the Divine Phoenix finally looked at Ye Qingtang’s heart.

“How… can this be…”

After it inspected Ye Qingtang’s heart for a long time, the Divine Phoenix’s expression changed suddenly.

“Lord Divine Phoenix, may I know what happened?” Ye Qingtang asked hurriedly.

“Does your heart belong to you?” The Divine Phoenix asked sternly.

Seeing that the Divine Phoenix was so solemn, Ye Qingtang hesitated for a moment but finally told the truth. “Lord Divine Phoenix, this heart is indeed not mine…”

“Where is it from!” The Divine Phoenix asked again.

“The Heart of the Demon God… is from the Demon God…” Helpless, Ye Qingtang could only confess everything.

“Impossible! How is that the Heart of the Demon God in your body!” The Divine Phoenix exclaimed particularly solemnly. “This is clearly the Heart of the Heavenly Dao! What has it got to do with the so-called Demon God?”

“Heart of the Heavenly Dao?!”

In both lives, it was the first time Ye Qingtang heard about this supposed Heart of the Heavenly Dao.

What was the Heart of the Heavenly Dao? It was clearly the Heart of the Demon God in her body, but why did it become the Heart of the Heavenly Dao—something she had never heard before—when said by the Divine Phoenix?
