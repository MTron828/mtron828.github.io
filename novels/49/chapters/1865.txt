Chapter 1866: Fu Qiu (3)

Fu Qiu was still pondering over it when it suddenly felt some violent shaking from the ground.

It turned around, walking towards the front. Through the walls of the Crystal Palace, it could witness everything that was happening outside clearly.

A black figure with a dominating presence was outside and there were endless groaning sounds. Fu Qiu just bit on its opium pipe and watched quietly, just like it did countless times in the past.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang was underground resting on the bed. She was still pondering over everything that had happened in the mystic realm when suddenly, the violent shaking was felt even underground, almost throwing her off the bed.

Little White Tiger also woke up. “What the heck, what’s wrong with this mystic realm?!”

Ye Qingtang had no idea either, but it seemed like Fu Qiu didn’t want them to know about what would happen during the day here. Why was it such a secret?

With the violent shaking, Ye Qingtang couldn’t fall asleep at all. She sat up, taking out the remaining spirit stones she had.

She heard from the fat catfishes that these spirit stones could be used for cultivation and so she couldn’t help but want to try it out.

So she sat cross-legged, placing the spirit stone in her palm and started cultivating.

Soon, she realized that during her cultivation, the spirit energy in the spirit stones was slowly absorbed into her body. What was even more fascinating was...

The energy in the spirit stones was very pure!

It only took a while before Ye Qingtang felt a significant increase in the power within her body.

She instantly felt energized.

Initially, she had thought that it was a wasted trip to this mystic realm, but she hadn’t expected to have discovered that the spirit stones could be used in cultivation.

Calming her mind, Ye Qingtang ended up using all the spirit stones in her cultivation.

The spirit energy within the spirit stones was slowly absorbed by Ye Qingtang’s body and at the same time, it lost its glowing luster. Now, the used spirit stones were dim and just like frosted glass.

Time passed and by the time Ye Qingtang absorbed all the spirit energy from the spirit stones, the violent shaking had stopped.

After a bit, someone knocked on her room door.

Fu Qiu stood outside.

When Ye Qingtang saw Fu Qiu, she had a look of surprise on her face but it quickly disappeared.

“It’s dark now.” Fu Qiu said with a cold expression on its face.

“You’ll only need to pay 2000 spirit stones tonight. If you can’t pay, get out now.”

Just as it said this, Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo walked out of their rooms and overheard Fu Qiu’s words. They were shocked.

They knew for a fact that they had to pay enough spirit stones in exchange for their stay at the Crystal Palace. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

But...

When did this fat catfish become this understanding?

Just yesterday, it had demanded 5000 spirit stones, but now it was only 2000 spirit stones?

Did it suddenly become benevolent?

Impossible.

Everyone was confused by its act.

Nevertheless...

Anyone who doesn’t take advantage of these terms would definitely be a fool.

Ye Qingtang’s demand for spirit stones had naturally increased after learning that the spirit stones could be used in cultivation.

“Okay.” Ye Qingtang replied with a polite smile and gathered everyone to head to the gambling town for more spirit stones.

It was pitch-dark outside the Crystal Palace. Now that the sun had set, the fat catfishes all came out of the underground holes, gathering around the stump with their large stomachs.

“Where do you think these fat catfishes get their spirit stones from? Do you think they dig underground for the spirit stones? I noticed that they don’t seem to lack spirit stones even after using so many every day.” Jiang Shaobai scanned around, noticing that the fat catfishes seemed to be bigger today compared to yesterday.
