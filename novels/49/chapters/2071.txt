Chapter 2072: Counter (1)

All of the Elder had grim expressions as well.

“Any news of the Grand Elder?” the Clan Master asked coldly.

As the Clan Elders looked at each other, their expressions, if possible, became even more solemn.

“Clan Master, the Grand Elder was no longer there when we went to the old palace...” one of them said.

“Not here? What do you mean?” The Clan Master’s expression was cold.

“Clan Master, we entered the secret passage after the Crimson League left but found signs that there were already people there. The Buddha statues guarding the place had all been destroyed as well and it seemed that the Grand Elder had already been killed....”

“Ridiculous!” The Clan Master instantly smashed the head of the Elder who spoke up.

Fresh blood splattered all over his head.

The whole hall fell silent.

“Where is the girl?” he asked coldly.

No one dared to reply to him in his anger, afraid that they would be the next victim.

But their silence gave him his answer.

“Great... great... great!” He burst out in laughter and shouted out three words.

“I guess both the Temple of Shadows and the Crimson League really do want to destroy us!” The Clan Master’s face was completely frosty now. The Clan Elders had ruined their plans of collecting all the Spirit of Chaos fragments but now, even Little You Yun had been taken away...

This had destroyed all their plans.

“Clan Master, should we recuperate first, then wait for the Crimson League to leave...” another person suggested.

As it stood, they were no match for the Crimson League now since their power was way beyond their league. And with the loss of Little You Yun, they were in deep trouble. They had no choice but to wait for the Crimson League to leave.

“Recuperate?” The Clan Master let out another bark of cold laugher and continued, “The Ancient You Clan has been planning this for years. How did they ruin our plans?”

“Clan Master, you mean...”

The Clan Master took a deep breath and closed his eyes gently.

“Where do you think I have been all this time?”

No one knew what he meant.

“I went to the Second Domain.”

Everyone froze at these words.

The Clan Master had gone to the Second Domain?

“The Temple of Shadows borrowed power from the Second Domain to ruin our plans, so why can’t I do the same?” The Clan Master looked at all of them.

“We are not the only ones who want the Spirit of Chaos. Many forces in the Second Domain want it as well. The Crimson League is from the Second Domain but there are many forces like them as well. We can’t possibly let the Temple of Shadows go so easily now that they’ve ruined our plans for the Spirit of Chaos, no?” the Clan Master said as his lips curved up into a cold smile.

There was no way he was going to let them have what he couldn’t obtain. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I’ve discussed with the forces of the Second Domain. As long as they help us clear our enemies in the Central Mainland, I will give them the Spirit of Chaos fragments after we win.”

Although he had still been hesitating about making this decision, the loss of Little You Yun was the last straw.

He wanted the Temple of Shadows and the Crimson League to pay in blood for what they had done!

The Ancient You Clan members who had been worrying all looked happier as they heard this.

“Clan Master, if we can borrow the might of the Second Domain, the Crimson League is nothing that we would fear. They only sent over a few people. As long as we can get more help, we don’t have to fear the Crimson League or the Temple of Shadows.”
