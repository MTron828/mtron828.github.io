Chapter 488: Elder Lin (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ning Luo’s actions were equivalent to admitting that he was the Yunxiao Sect disciple hidden in Xuanling Sect.

However, Ning Luo was Elder Lin’s favorite disciple as well. As long as he could save Ning Luo today, perhaps Ning Luo would request the Yunxiao Sect to let Elder Lin and Lin Feng off on account of their master and disciple relations…

“Elder Lin, do you think that you will able to live after saving Ning Luo today?” Obviously, Ye Qingtang saw through all of Elder Lin’s calculations.

“Humph! You don’t need to worry about this.” Elder Lin scoffed. “Ye Qingtang, you truly shocked me. You understood the Paragon Skill as a red spirit root and advanced to the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two in such a short span of time… It is a pity that you have depleted almost all your primordial qi after the battle with Ning Luo earlier on. I don’t need any effort to kill you now.”

Elder Lin had been hiding for a long time and witnessed the entire battle between Ye Qingtang and Ning Luo. Thus, he was certain that Ye Qingtang’s primordial qi was already exhausted, and she was not his opponent.

Qin Huan, Zhu Changge, and the rest were utterly taken aback.

Previously, they were unaware of the identity of Ning Luo and Fu Lingtian until they found out from Elder Lin that they were actually from Yunxiao Sect…

Ye Qingtang frowned deeply at that moment.

As what Elder Lin said, she had used too much primordial qi because of the Ultimate Origin Skill just now.

Talking so much crap with Elder Lin was merely her using it as an opportunity to recover her primordial qi.

“Ye Qingtang, how would I give you a chance to turn your fate around?!” Then, Elder Lin hollered in fury and rammed a palm towards Ye Qingtang.

Noticing the situation, the Xuanling Sect disciples were shocked. They originally wanted to stop it, but Elder Lin was too fast, and they could not react in time.

“Careful, Junior Sister Ye!” Zhu Changge shouted.

Without Zhu Changge’s reminder, Ye Qingtang had already dodged to a few meters away.

Clank!

A long knife appeared in Elder Lin’s hand.

Elder Lin chased after Ye Qingtang swiftly as he brandished the knife.

The knife aura swept across the surrounding imposingly.

Since Ye Qingtang did not have sufficient primordial qi in her body, she did not dare to counter-attack with full force and could only fight as she retreated.

Unconsciously, the Demonic Blood Sword had already blocked over ten moves from Elder Lin, and Ye Qingtang was in the disadvantage afterward.

“Ye Qingtang, you must die today!” Elder Lin sneered. “I heard Ning Luo say that the Holy Lady of Yunxiao Sect, Ye You, seems to have some enmity with you… You should feel honored that I’m using your head to exchange for the lives of Lin Feng and mine!”

“Old ignorant fellow!” A glint shone in Ye Qingtang’s eyes, and the Demonic Blood Sword was slashed down instantly.

Clang!

As the knife and sword clashed, sparks were ignited, and a formless blast of air cracked the ground as though it was a physical object. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

After a hundred moves, Ye Qingtang’s primordial qi was almost completely depleted while Elder Lin’s courage mounted as the battle progressed.

If Ye Qingtang had enough primordial qi, killing Elder Lin was extremely easy. Yet, helplessly…

“Haha. Ye Qingtang, even if you are a genius, you still have to die in my hands today.” Elder Lin grasped the best time and used the knife aura to shake Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang remained silent as she recovered her primordial qi rapidly.

“Death is already near at hand, but you still wish to recover your primordial qi and fight with me again?!” Elder Lin walked towards Ye Qingtang in big strides as the long knife in his hand clattered.

“No!”

Noticing the situation, Zhu Changge wanted to rush forward.

“Senior Brother Zhu, it’s best to not act rashly.” Lin Feng blocked in front of Zhu Changge.

“Scram!” Zhu Changge pushed Lin Feng to the ground in an instant.

“I’ll kill you!” Qin Huan dashed forward and kicked Lin Feng’s face.
