Chapter 889 For You

Ye Qingtang looked at Ling Yan. Although this man did not have any martial skills and it looked like he could be easily crushed by any powerful martial figures, the truth was not so. He was an extremely dangerous presence.

It was still alright if he was a friend, but once he was an enemy and he schemed against you, you would probably be hit by a destructive strike.

“Ling Yan, why would you tell me all of your plans?” Looking at Ling Yan in confusion, Ye Qingtang asked curiously.

Ling Yan was stunned to hear her question and smiled faintly. “Didn’t you ask me just now?”

“So… I asked you, and you told me just like that?” Ye Qingtang had a strange expression.

Ling Yan shook his head with a chuckle. “If others asked me, I wouldn’t say a word, but it is different if it’s Miss Ye.”

“Me?” Ye Qingtang looked at Ling Yan and asked. “How am I different?”

“You are different in my heart.” The corner of his lips tugged up as he looked at Ye Qingtang with eyes filled with temptation and danger.

She totally could not understand what crazy things Ling Yan was sputtering…

In Ye Qingtang’s previous life, she spent almost her entire life being chased by others. She was extremely vigilant of the outside world every second, and the only thing she had in mind was martial cultivation. It was no exaggeration to call her a martial fanatic. This was so as only by becoming more powerful could she barely survive the schemes from the outside world. She seemed to have seen such a look from Ling Yan on other men, but his was a little different. Even Ye Qingtang was unaware of why she did not loathe nor shun from him extremely.

Nonetheless, even up to this day, Ye Qingtang still could not comprehend what this exactly meant.

If others looked at her like that, there would be a danger signal going off inside her. However, Ling Yan did not give her such feelings.

“For you.”

As he spoke, Ling Yan flipped his hand over and extended his right palm towards Ye Qingtang, and he handed the Heavenly Demon Pearl which Ye You spat out earlier to Ye Qingtang

Noticing the situation, Ye Qingtang was filled with surprise and was even in disbelief.

The Heavenly Demon Pearl was one of the three great inheritances in the Dragon Vein, and many cultivators even lost their lives for it. One could imagine how precious this was.

However…

Even so, at this very instant, Ling Yan wanted to give her the inheritance of the Heavenly Demon he schemed out from Ye You?!

Almost instinctively, Ye Qingtang immediately shook her head. The inheritance of the Heavenly Demon was too valuable, and she must not accept it.

Ling Yan chuckled lightly when he saw Ye Qingtang’s reaction. “Miss Ye, this Heavenly Demon Pearl originally belongs to Ye You. I only used a small scheme and took it from her. Moreover, Ye You once stole your spirit root. Thus, the inheritance of the Heavenly Demon is equivalent to Ye You’s interest to you.”

“It is yours since you stole it. How could I accept it?” Ye Qingtang asked with a frown.

“Oh?” After hearing what Ye Qingtang said, Ling Yan’s lips tugged up slightly. “So according to your logic, Ye You stole your spirit root, so it should belong to Ye You now.”

Ye Qingtang had no words to refute this one sentence from Ling Yan.

For some reason though, Ye Qingtang had never lost almost any arguments in both her lives, but after meeting Ling Yan, she would always unknowingly be beaten to it every time she spoke to him.
