“Why did you just let the people from the Wind Sword Sect go?” The Blood Moon Sect Elder followed Ye Qingtang as she walked out of the Floating Light Canyon. He suddenly had other thoughts in his mind.

Ye Qingtang stopped and took a glance at the Blood Moon Sect Elder.

“Source of the Marrow Pill.”

The Blood Moon Sect Elder was stunned as he heard the words.

“I just asked only haha…” He avoided Ye Qingtang’s eyesight, but how he wished to strangle the girl in front of him.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder felt depressed. Ye Qingtang joined the mission for the sect and the Xuanming points. But what could he get?

Nothing in the sect was attractive to him, especially the honor of the sect.

He could only bear with it when Ye Qingtang suppressed him.

Ye Qingtang rubbed her brows as she looked at the Blood Moon Sect Elder.

The old guy would not even behave for a second. If she did not watch him tightly, he would definitely target others.

The mission was smooth this time. Ye Qingtang did not wish to waste any time as she still needed to cultivate in the inner sect. She then rushed back to Xuanling Sect.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder returned to his yard gloomily when they returned to the sect. Ye Qingtang was amused by his expression and decided to refine some Source of the Marrow Pills for him in the next few days.

Ye Qingtang returned to her yard, but she realized that something was not right when she pushed open the gate of the yard.

Since she provided Fei Ying and Ni Shang with basic cultivation technique previously, they would cultivate and practice all the time in the yard. However, the yard now was empty and messy. There was the smell of blood in the air.

An uneasy feeling rose in her heart. She then rushed into the yard and saw pools of blood on the stone path at the center of the yard.

The blood was dry now, but it still stroke her eyes.

“Young… Young Lady…” A weak voice came from the house at the side. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Ye Qingtang looked towards the house, and she was totally stunned.

Fei Ying, who was injured heavily, laid at the door, and his face was full of wounds.

“You are finally back… Young Lady…”

Ye Qingtang felt uneasier as she looked at his injured body. She then noticed that Ni Shang was not around. She dashed towards Fei Ying and asked, “Where is Ni Shang?”

Fei Ying shivered as he heard the question. Tears flowed out of his swollen eyes. He kneeled in front of Ye Qingtang and knocked his head on the ground constantly.

“Young Lady, please… save Ni Shang…”

“What happened!” Ye Qingtang held Fei Ying’s collar and dragged him up.

Fei Ying was choked with sobs. “Ni Shang… Ni Shang was brought away by them. I was so useless… I couldn’t protect her. Young Lady, please, you are the only one who can save her now.”

Fei Ying told everything to Ye Qingtang slowly.

After Ye Qingtang left for her mission, Fei Ying and Ni Shang used all the time to cultivate and guard the yard. They wanted to help Ye Qingtang to look after the silver wolf, but it disappeared one day. Both of them were nervous and worried about the silver wolf. However, danger approached them secretly.
