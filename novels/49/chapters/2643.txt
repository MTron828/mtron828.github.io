Chapter 2644 Temple Holy Lord (1)

For the next two days, Ye Qingtang did not rest at all but rushed from the Great Immortal Temple to the Fourth Domain transit station.

The so-called Fourth Domain transit station had existed for tens of thousands of years. In the earliest days, there was a teleportation portal in the transit station that could teleport people directly to the Fourth Domain.

However, ever since the Fourth Domain disappeared and became a dead domain, this transit station had been completely abandoned. It no longer had the bustle and vibrancy from tens of thousands of years ago.

Now that the Fourth Domain legacy had been activated and was hidden in the transit station, the place seemed to have regained some of its former glory. To put it bluntly, the Fourth Domain transit station had been abandoned a long time ago and had become a huge, deep forest canyon.

It was said that there were many powerful demonic creatures in this deep forest canyon. However, following the opening of the Fourth Domain legacy, nearly all the top experts of the Divine Venerate Domain were alerted. A large number of experts had swamped the deep forest canyon, killing all those demonic creatures.

Ye Qingtang descended from the sky and arrived at the periphery of the forest.

As far as the eye could see, the periphery of the deep forest was basically packed with people. As the news of the opening of the Fourth Domain legacy spread, even some of the weaker family clans had come here just to witness a historical event. Many experts were not qualified to enter and just planned to pick up any scraps.

It was not just the Divine Venerate Domain. Be it the Blue Sky Domain or the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain, such a situation was very common whenever extraordinary legacies were opened. Ye Qingtang did not mind.

The outer perimeter of the forest was filled with independent experts or ordinary family clans. Peak experts who were truly qualified would not remain in the outer perimeter. They had already entered the forest. Ye Qingtang did not dawdle but flew towards the deep forest. Before Ye Qingtang could enter the depths, she was stopped by a Worldly Emperor level expert leading over a dozen Ninth Heaven Level Divine Lord practitioners. “Excuse me, why are you standing in my way?” Ye Qingtang asked coldly as she swept her gaze across the Worldly Emperor level expert and his men.

“Ha….”

The Worldly Emperor level practitioner sized up Ye Qingtang and sneered in disdain.

“Little girl, do you know that this is the Fourth Domain legacy place? Where are you from and what kind of force are you? How dare you barge in without any notice?!” The man stared at Ye Qingtang and laughed coldly.

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly.

After the opening of the Fourth Domain legacy, many supreme forces from the Divine Venerate Domain had already stationed themselves in advance.

Those powerful factions had already completely sealed off the perimeter in order to prevent random people from sneaking in. They did not give ordinary family clans and independent cultivators the slightest chance. Anyone who dared to try and trespass would be killed.

“Great Immortal Temple. Scram,” Ye Qingtang said impatiently.

As soon as Ye Qingtang finished speaking, the Worldly Emperor-level cultivator and some of the other Emperor-level practitioners standing nearby roared with laughter.
