Chapter 2445: Big Yellow Dog (6)

Ye Qingtang was shocked to see the above-Emperor level monster standing in her way.

She had no idea how to fight it at all. The difference in their abilities was as huge as a giant, and its power was in an entirely different dimension compared to hers.

“You useless trash… you can’t even escape from this low-level prey at the bottom of the food chain… You’re an embarrassment to Shi Tian,” the big yellow dog in her arms scolded.

“You deal with it then!”

Sick of its yammering, she threw it to the ground.

Since it couldn’t stop talking about the bottom of the food chain, it could deal with them!

“Woof woof woof!”

The big yellow dog barked at Ye Qingtang.

She was speechless.

She had never met someone so shameless before. It had been yapping away so much and now that it was for real, it was pretending to be a dog?

“Could you be any more shameless?” she asked the big yellow dog wagging its tail at her.

“Woof woof…” the big yellow dog continued barking.

“Didn’t you say that it was from the bottom of the food chain? Why are you pretending to be a dog now?”

“What are you saying? I’m not pretending to be a dog… I am a dog,” the big yellow dog said with a dog-like grin, revealing one huge white tooth.

But just as it was speaking, the above-Emperor level monster turned its gaze on it. Seeing this, the big yellow dog quickly turned to look at the above-Emperor level monster before telling Ye Qingtang, “You useless thing, how can you be so scared of such a useless monster? Watch and learn!”

Ye Qingtang was slightly moved by its words. Was it really… not afraid of the above-Emperor level monster? Did it actually have something up its sleeves?

Now that she thought about it, the big yellow dog was indeed strange. Just the fact that it could speak was strange. In her two lives, she had yet to meet a speaking dog that was not related to demons.

If this big yellow dog could really deal with the above-Emperor level monster…

“I’m talking about you. Come, focus your attention on me. Focus all your attention on me,” the big yellow dog wagged its tail and looked at the above-Emperor level monsters.

Whether it was a coincidence or if they really understood the big yellow dog’s words, the above-Emperor level monsters all turned their eyes on the big yellow dog.

“Let me say a few words…” the big yellow dog said. “We’re all animals here, so let’s not pretend to be anything more. I’ll save you some face. You all can head towards the north and we’ll head towards the east. Lower your heads and don’t look up. Who do you think you’re crossing?”

She was speechless.

She must have gone mad.

She had actually harbored hopes… towards this big yellow dog!

“Roar”!

In the next second, the above-Emperor level monsters all roared.

The big yellow dog stayed still, as though it was in deep thought. After a long time, it looked at the above-Emperor level monster in front of it and said, “Your mouth stinks…”

The big yellow dog quickly turned around and wagged its tail at her. “Have you learned anything?” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

She was speechless.

What had she learned? To tell the above-Emperor level monsters that their mouths stank?

“This bottom-level feeder is no match for me. You should deal with it and make sure not to let Shi Tian down,” the big yellow dog said.

Ye Qingtang honestly had no words.

Hadn’t she emphasized many times before already that she had no idea who Shi Tian was?
