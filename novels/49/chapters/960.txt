Chapter 961 Boy Genius (1)

The Great Elder naturally felt that he could not allow the Ye Family to be embarrassed like that, so he had sent word to his grandson in the far off Leiting Sect to hurry back to Lin Town to hold the fort.

“That’s great. Great Elder, since your grandson is an inner sect disciple of the Leiting Sect, if he can return, the Duan Family won’t dare to be so arrogant,” Third Elder said with a smile.

All the younger members of the Ye Family who were present in the main hall looked pleased when they heard that the Great Elder’s grandson was returning.

Most of them were brought here by the two elders and naturally knew about the Great Elder’s grandson.

The Leiting Sect was one of the sects in the Formidable Heavens Dynasty. It was comparable with the Xuanling Sect in terms of power, but it was situated near the northern border and was in a different area from the Xuanling Sect, Qinglin Sect, and the Wind Moon Sect.

The Great Elder’s grandson was called Dan Yifan. He was naturally talented and had a superior green spirit root. He was only seventeen or eighteen years old but had already become an inner sect disciple in the Leiting Sect.

The younger members of the Ye Family, who had been oppressed by the Duan Family, now pinned their hopes on Dan Yifan returning to stand up for them.

Ye Ling was a little relieved when he heard the news but did not notice that Ye Qingtang, who was standing behind him, had a rather odd expression on her face.

At that moment, a Ye Family servant entered with news.

“Master, Elders, Young Master Dan has returned.”

When everyone in the main hall heard the news, their faces lit with joy.

“Speak of the devil.” Third Elder looked pleased as he turned to look at the Great Elder.

The Great Elder’s face also showed a hint of a smile.

When the younger members in the audience heard the news, they immediately rushed out to welcome him.

One must know that before Dan Yifan had entered the sect, he had long been idolized by this group as a boy genius.

In a moment, a handsome young man dressed in green and surrounded by a crowd walked in slowly. His face showed a hint of a smile. When he stepped into the main hall, he bowed to the Great Elder.

“Grandfather, I have come.”

“Good, good, good…” The Great Elder looked at his grandson who had arrived in time, his eyes filled with contentment.

The Great Elder then introduced the others to his grandson. “This is your Grandfather Feng, whom you have met before. This is the Second Elder of the Ye Family.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Dan Yifan nodded blandly when he saw Second Elder.

“This is the Master of the Ye Family.”

Dan Yifan nodded slightly in acknowledgment.

“And this is the Master’s daughter and the Eldest Young Lady of the Ye Family,” continued the Great Elder.

Dan Yifan only glanced at Ye Qingtang.

For the past few years, he had been cultivating in the Leiting Sect without leaving it at all. From letters that his grandfather had sent to him, he had learned about his grandfather joining the Ye Family, including some of the circumstances surrounding the Ye Family.

“I heard that Eldest Young Lady has already entered the Xuanling Sect.” Dan Yifan spoke smilingly. He already had a general idea of the Ye Family’s situation from the Great Elder’s letters. Of course, he also knew that the Ye Family’s Eldest Young Lady had entered the Xuanling Sect a year ago and had become an outer sect disciple.

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang spoke blandly. She had no special feelings towards this Dan Yifan, whom everyone idolized.

“The Leiting Sect where I am situated is tens of thousands of miles away from the Xuanling Sect. However, they are all sects. If you encounter anything you don’t understand in your martial studies in the future, I may be able to help you a little.” Dan Yifan spoke frankly, but his words were filled with arrogance.
