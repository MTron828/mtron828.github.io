Chapter 1165: The Light of Hope (2)

“That’s right!” Perfected Xuanchen nodded with a serious expression. “Qingtang found a Dharma treasure that can control spirit energy…”

Afterward, Perfected Xuanchen peered at Ye Qingtang discreetly. This was the explanation that he and Ye Qingtang discussed earlier on.

After hearing what Perfected Xuanchen said, Elder Bai Kui and the rest looked at Ye Qingtang in astonishment.

“Control this mainland’s… spirit energy?!”

Ye Qingtang nodded and agreed according to the priorly agreed explanation with Perfected Xuanchen.

“Yes.”

“Holy Lady… control this mainland’s spirit energy… In this case, we can create a God!” The Blood Moon Elder’s towering body approached them with great strides, causing thunderous rumbles.

“Look… how much spirit energy can this huge and unrivaled body of mine digest?! In this case, I can become an Emperor-level figure… No, I can become a God!” Blood Moon Elder looked at Ye Qingtang in exhilaration. “Holy Lady… don’t waste any more time. Give me all the spirit energy to digest. By then, I can crush the You Ancient Clan into pieces with a single punch!”

“Give it all to you…”

“That is too much from you!”

“Where are you from and who are you to talk so arrogantly! What do you mean by giving all to you?! Can’t we become powerful figures and protect our homeland?”

“Eldest Young Lady, who is this monster?!”

Before Ye Qingtang could explain, the Blood Moon Elder’s lips twitched. “I’m a monster? What a joke. My unrivaled body can absorb tons of spirit energy, and it is nothing difficult to be an Emperor-level figure by then. What do you all want to absorb spirit energy with your ant-like bodies for? It’s simply a waste. Also, I am not a monster. I am an Elder of the Blood Moon Sect, and I possessed this body from an Ancient You Clan Elder.

“Pfft. An Elder of Blood Moon Sect… Big deal…”

“Yeah, I don’t see your Blood Moon Sect coming to protect our homeland.”

“You’re big-sized, so you’re great? There are so many Emperor-level figures, but there’s barely anyone with a body like yours.”

Ye Qingtang was having a splitting headache from the quarrel, and she frowned immediately.

“Quiet.”

“Do you all hear it? Told you all to shut up!” The Blood Moon Elder snickered. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“I want you to keep quiet.” Ye Qingtang shot a look at Blood Moon Elder.

The voice of Blood Moon Elder’s current body was like thunder that hurt everyone’s eardrums, and no one could withstand it.

“You’re already at the peak of Yang Lord Eighth Heaven, and this is the limit that this mainland can withstand. No matter how much spirit energy you absorb, you will only be a Yang Lord on this mainland. It is impossible to become an Emperor-level figure, much less a God. Everyone has a different limit for the absorption of spirit energy, and absorbing spirit energy by force will only result in death.” Ye Qingtang looked at the Blood Moon Elder and poured cold water on the Blood Moon Elder, waking him up from his beautiful dream of becoming an Emperor-level figure.

“What… This…” Blood Moon Elder was surprised by Ye Qingtang’s explanation.

Daoist Zijin, Elder Bai Kui, and the rest wanted to laugh when they saw the Blood Moon Elder’s expression.

This person was truly greedy to want to become an Emperor-level figure and even a God…

The spirit energy on this mainland was limited. Becoming an Emperor-level figure required the absorption of spirit energy, coordination of a corresponding mental state, and even some mysterious enlightenment. On top of that, all of those would only give a tiny chance of becoming an Emperor-level figure.

The Blood Moon Elder sighed immediately. After everything, he could not absorb spirit energy and was agitated for nothing…
