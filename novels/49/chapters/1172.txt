Hearing that Ye Qingtang was willing to head to Heaven City, the Beiming Manor Chief snickered secretly. The powerful figure presiding over Heaven City had strong relations with him. Once Ye Qingtang reached Heaven City, she would have to listen to his commands, and by then… they just needed to let this lady die in the hands of the Ancient You Clan people…

“Alright.” The ancient clan Master stood up and looked at Peerless School Sect Master. “You will be responsible for bringing Miss Ye to Heaven City.”

“Noted!” Peerless School Sect Master agreed and immediately led Ye Qingtang out without any delay.

After leaving the main hall, the Peerless School Sect Master looked at Ye Qingtang and asked meaningfully, “Miss Ye, there is some conflict between you and Beiming Manor, right?”

Ye Qingtang did not deny it. Back then, Beiming Manor’s Yang Lords chased after her to take her life, but one of them was killed by her instead. It was indeed considered that there were some conflicts between her and Beiming Manor then.

“Miss Ye, the commander guarding Heaven City has a deep relationship with Beiming Manor Chief. You should be careful,” Peerless School Sect Master said.

Peerless School was very clear of Beiming Manor Chief’s way of seeking revenge regardless of the consequences. However, in this special period of time, Peerless School Sect Master did not wish to see the people of this mainland killing each other. Thus, he reminded Ye Qingtang.

“Thank you for your reminder. I understand.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

Half a day later, Ye Qingtang arrived outside a huge city with the Peerless School Sect Master showing the way.

Ahead of them was Heaven City. The surrounding city walls towered into the clouds, and the terrain was extremely steep, making the city appear to be easy to guard and difficult to attack.

Even though the current combat power of the powerful figures in Heaven City wasinsufficient, it was tough for the Ancient You Clan to forcefully conquer Heaven City as well.

Very quickly, Ye Qingtang and the Peerless School Sect Master were let into the city after revealing their identity.

“Haha, Peerless School Sect Master, it’s been long.”

In no time, a middle-aged man walked over with great strides to welcome them.

“Long time no see, Brother Gu Yu.” Peerless School Sect Master looked at the middle-aged man and smiled. “This is Miss Ye, Ye Qingtang, one of the Yang Lords of our mainland. She is here to aid Heaven City.”

A cold glint flashed across Gu Yu’s eyes discreetly, though the smile remained on his face. “Miss Ye, I know you. The Eldest Young Lady of Ye Family and the Young Valley Master of Falling Sky Valley. A legendary figure of the mainland. Knowing a man by reputation is truly not as good as meeting him face to face.”

“You have overpraised me.” Ye Qingtang replied politely.

“Miss Ye, this is Brother Gu Yu, the overall commander of Heaven City. He is from the ancient clan and is also a Yang Lord,” Peerless School Sect Master said.

“Nice to meet you.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

“It is the best that Miss Ye can come to Heaven City to assist us. The three talents of the Ancient You Clan are guarding outside the city, and the youngest Yang Lord of the ancient clan, Mo Feng, lost his life in the battle three days ago. This is a huge blow to Heaven City. If not for the steep terrain of Heaven City which makes it hard to attack, it would probably have fallen already.” Gu Yu sighed and shook his head.

“Please follow me.”

Then, Gu Yu led Peerless School Sect Master and Ye Qingtang toward the towering city walls.

After arriving at the top of the city walls, the high position allowed one to take in the entire situation in the vicinity with the naked eye.

Furthermore, there was an ancient array formation deep in the ground of Heaven City. Any powerful figure who was in close proximity to Heaven City would be unable to fly in the air. This was also one of the greatest resources of Heaven City they could rely on.
