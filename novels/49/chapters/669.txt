Chapter 670 Leaving the Mystic Realm (4)

The Blood Moon Elder’s lips twitched. They wished to leave the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm as fast as possible, yet this Fiendcelestial Beast still wanted to stay in it?

“You still want to go back in?” the Blood Moon Elder asked.

The little white tiger said, “Duh. Everyone outside wants to drink my blood and eat my flesh. The Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm is still the safest. You all can leave. I won’t walk you out already. Just come back frequently to visit me.”

It wanted to retreat backward, but when its four tiny paws took a few steps, it was already picked up by Ye Qingtang by its

neck.

“F*ck you! Why are you grabbing me! Quickly put me down!”

“Are you a fool?” Ye Qingtang looked at the little white tiger which bared its fangs and brandished its claws in hopes of escaping

“F*ck you. You are the fool!”

“The Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm is already closed. How are you going to go back?” Ye Qingtang raised the hand that was holding onto the little white tiger and let it see its surroundings.

After glancing a full round, there were only green trees in the surroundings and not a slight trace of the mystic realm’s entrance.

The little white tiger that was still struggling initially was completely dumbfounded after taking a sweeping glance…

Its Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realmmmmmmmmmm!!!

“It’s all your fault! You caused me to lose even my last shelter. If I leave, won’t I have to endure many hardships and drift from place to place?” Despair filled the little white tiger’s face. Thinking about its miserable life when it was chased after for its life, it wished it could rush back into the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm!

“Since you really don’t wish to leave, I’ll let you have your

wish.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After saying that, Ye Qingtang immediately placed the little white tiger back on the ground.

“You can stay here to wait for the next time the mystic realm opens.”

The little white tiger which regained its freedom was instantly a little dumbfounded.

Wait for the mystic realm to open the next time?

God knows how many years this mystic realm required to open. If it continued to waste time here waiting, god knows how many humans and demonic beasts it would encounter!

Almost when its paws landed on the ground, the little white tiger turned around, leaped, and directly hugged Ye Qingtang’s calf!

“Wait! I changed my mind!”

“Change your mind?” Ye Qingtang raised a brow slightly.

The little white tiger looked up and nodded seriously. “Since I’ve already signed an equality contract, I must be responsible for you. Thus, I’ll leave with you. I must protect your safety.”

“…” Ye Qingtang rubbed her temples. She suddenly had an impulse to stuff it back into the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm.

Ye Qingtang had just left the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm and could not be bothered with this crazy Fiendcelestial Beast, so she allowed it to nag.

After observing for a moment, Ye Qingtang brought the Blood Moon Elder and the little white tiger away from this forest. Before night fell, they found a cave to rest in.

When they were in the Hell of Avicinaraka, they had to be cautious every moment. Now that they were finally free from that dangerous land, Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder could finally sleep peacefully.

The moonlight enshrouded the place gradually. Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder fell asleep soundly.

The little white tiger was sprawled outside the cave, seeming to be in a deep sleep as well.

In this dark night, a ball of black fog quietly floated out from Ye Qingtang’s chest.

Very quickly, that fog condensed into a little black ball about the size of a palm. The little black ball suddenly opened its eyes and looked straight at the little white tiger which was sleeping outside the cave.

The appearance of the little black ball caused the little lightning dragon in Ye Qingtang’s arms to wriggle instinctively. It peaked its head out silently and looked at the little black ball.
