The black-robed person charged towards Ye Qingtang once again, wanting to take her life.

Ye Qingtang advanced as well and entered a brawl with the black-robed person.

Both of them exchanged blows. If it were other ordinary cultivators, they would have long died.

“F*ck you!” Suddenly, the little white tiger leaped up and bit the black-robed person’s calf.

Even if the current little white tiger could not use the stored demonic force in its body and had almost no combat power, it was, after all, a Fiendcelestial Beast. Its fangs were parallel to a divine weapon and could easily pierce through metal.

“F*ck you. I’m biting you to death!” As the little white tiger spoke, it bit down again.

Its sharp teeth pierced into the black-robed person’s calf, and blood oozed out instantly.

The black-robed person scoffed coldly and used the impact of his martial aura to throw the little white tiger several meters away.

However, the little white tiger had thick skin as a Fiendcelestial Beast and ran back quickly. “F*ck you. I have thick skin and can endure beatings. Even if it’s a Yang Lord, I can also let him hammer me a few times, much less a Yin Lord like you.”

Afterward, the little white tiger opened its mouth and charged toward the black-robed person. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

This time, however, it was already kicked away by the black-robed person before it could touch him.

“Are you alright?”

Ye Qingtang’s brows were slightly furrowed as she looked at the little white tiger that was flung away. That black-robed person was, after all, a Yin Yang Perfected Lord, and his skills were undoubted. Even if the little white tiger was a Fiendcelestial Beast, it probably did not feel good to be beaten a few times.

“F*ck you…” The little white tiger crawled up from the ground staggeringly and stared at Ye Qingtang. “What do you mean… Are you looking down on me? You should ask whether his leg that kicked me is alright!”

“…” Ye Qingtang stared blankly at the little white tiger.

“I’ll kill you!” Suddenly enraged, the black-robed person walked toward the little white tiger.

“Wait…” The little white tiger’s hair stood up all over. “Big brother of the human clan, I was wrong. I still have something on. You all can fight first!”

After leaving that sentence, the little white tiger turned around and vanished without a trace.

It had been chased for years in the outside world, and its fleeing abilities were already at the peak of perfection.

“Ye Qingtang, if you awaken to your senses now, I still can consider sparing your life!” The black-robed person looked at Ye Qingtang once again after watching the little white tiger escape.

“It’s not that I’m not awakening to my senses. It’s that you’re too obstinate to be awakened,” Ye Qingtang said with a calm expression.

“Haha. Ye Qingtang, no matter what you do, the ending of this mainland has already been fixed. No one will be spared. Everyone will die.” The black-robed person laughed coldly.

“Given your skills, it is simply delusional if you wish to destroy this mainland… Or does this have to do with the Dimension Wall…” Ye Qingtang spoke slowly while looking at the black-robed person.

Given the black-robed person’s skills at the First Heaven of Yin Yang Perfected Lord, how could he destroy this mainland?

The only thing that Ye Qingtang could think of was the Dimension Wall that the little white tiger mentioned previously.

After hearing Ye Qingtang mention the Dimension Wall, there was an evident change in that black-robed person’s voice. “That Fiendcelestial Beast… actually told you about the Dimension Wall as well…”

Originally, Ye Qingtang guessed that perhaps this black-robed person wished to use the blood of the thousands of cultivators in the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm as a sacrifice to that Ice Frost Divine Sword.

But even if the Ice Frost Divine Sword resurrected, it was impossible to destroy a mainland if there was no corresponding level of skills.

As such, Ye Qingtang started to suspect the Dimension Wall.

If the Dimension Wall was damaged or disappeared, powerful figures from the outside world could easily come into here.
