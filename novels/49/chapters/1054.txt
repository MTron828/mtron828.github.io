Chapter 1055 Three Orders To Kill

When they heard Ye Qingtang’s words, the looks of fear on the faces of Ye Family members instantly vanished, never to be seen again. Only excitement and agitation remained.

Just as Ye Qingtang said, if the Ye Family was massacred, then Ye Qingtang would fight the Beiming Manor to the death. How terrifying would it be to have a powerful Yang Lord lying in ambush? Also, could the few powerful Yang Lords of Beiming Manor really guard tens of thousands of people every day without leaving their side?

By then, the Beiming Manor would be unable to find Ye Qingtang, who would be lying in wait. But Ye Qingtang would be clearly aware of the Beiming Manor’s position!

Even if the Yang Lords found Ye Qingtang, they might not be able to kill her with one stroke, causing Ye Qingtang’s vengeance to be even crueler and terrifying… Then, the tens of thousands of people in Beiming Manor would live in fear, and those who had not yet become Yang Lords would live in the shadow of death…

The Ye Family had a few hundred people, but the Beiming Manor had tens of thousands of people. However, the Beiming Manor Master and Yang Lords were not idiots. They did not dare touch a single hair on a Ye Family disciple’s head without first killing Ye Qingtang!

“You…”

At that moment, the Beiming Manor envoy gritted his teeth. If Ye Qingtang kept her word, tens of thousands of people from the Beiming Manor would die because they killed a hundred people from the Ye Family!

“Right now, there are over a hundred Ye Family disciples. I guarantee I will not act. Let me see if you dare to touch a single person.” Ye Qingtang fixed her gaze on the Beiming Manor envoy and spoke with a cold laugh.

“You dare to touch me.”

At that moment, Elder Bai Kui’s grandson, Ye Leng, who had changed his surname to Ye, stepped forward and pointed to the Beiming Manor envoy.

Would their Ye Family be afraid of the Beiming Manor?!

It was worthwhile to exchange one person’s life for a few thousand lives!

“Ye Family… you will pay an unimaginably terrible price… for your arrogance!” Veins stood up on the Beiming Manor envoy’s forehead. He did not dare to touch so much as a hair on a Ye Family disciple’s head. If this Yang Lord really went crazy, the consequences would be unimaginable.

The top three sects were very familiar with the Yang Lords in this mainland. But what kind of personality did Ye Qingtang have, and would she actually do as she said? Who could be certain?

When she saw that the Beiming Manor envoy was about to leave, Ye Qingtang stepped forward and blocked his way. The powerful force of a Yang Lord immediately shot skywards.

“What are you doing!” The Beiming Manor envoy was shocked when he saw what was happening

“You’ve offended me… shouldn’t you leave something behind.” Ye Qingtang stared at the Beiming Manor envoy and said coldly.

“When two major forces are in a battle… We are equivalent to envoys of war. How dare you ignore the rules and kill a war envoy?!” The Beiming Manor envoy said in shock.

“Of course I won’t.” Ye Qingtang’s lips curved upwards slightly. Then, she used the force of a Yang Lord to press down on the Beiming Manor envoy.

“Puff…”

The Beiming Manor envoy’s face was ashen. Blood shot out of his mouth as he repeatedly retreated.

“You… you dare… harm my martial arts foundation…” The Beiming Manor envoy stared at Ye Qingtang in shock. This Yang Lord was completely disregarding the rules… Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I’m giving you a small punishment today. If you dare to be disrespectful to my Ye Family in the future, your life will not be spared.” Ye Qingtang shouted coldly.

“In the future, anyone who harms my Ye Family disciples will be killed!

“In the future, anyone who impedes my Ye Family affairs will be killed!

“In the future, anyone who harms my Ye Family elders will be killed!”

Ye Qingtang voice was bone-chilling. From that day onward, these three killing orders would reverberate through this mainland.
