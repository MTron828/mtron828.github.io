Chapter 1161: Supplying Spirit Energy (1)

Little You Yun stared unblinkingly at the candy with her large black eyes. Her little tongue greedily licked her small lips. She waved her small hands, walked over to take the candy from Perfected Xuanchen’s hands, and smiled brilliantly.

Ye Qingtang was rendered speechless by her master’s ease in coaxing children.

When he saw that Ye Qingtang’s expression looked rather strange, Perfected Xuanchen laughed in embarrassment. “I once had a daughter… so… I have some experience in coaxing children…”

“…”

Her master was certainly “multi-talented”.

Little You Yun held the candy that Perfected Xuanchen had handed her and licked it with satisfaction. Her little face beamed with a sweet smile.

When he saw that little You Yun did not seem to be angry anymore, Perfected Xuanchen gently coaxed her. “Little You Yun, can you manipulate the spirit energy once more for grandfather?”

Little You Yun tilted her head to look at Perfected Xuanchen. Her large black eyes blinked; then, she glanced at the candy in her hand that was mostly gone. She stuffed the remaining piece in her mouth so that her little cheeks bulged. She clapped her small hands and with her cheeks still bulging, nodded at Perfected Xuanchen.

Perfected Xuanchen could not help but laugh softly at little You Yun. He involuntarily rubbed her small head and said gently, “Little You Yun is such a good girl. Grandfather will bring her to eat something nice later.”

When little You Yun heard that, her eyes immediately brightened, and she nodded vigorously.

Ye Qingtang could not help but giggle at the scene. If she had not seen it with her own eyes, she would not have imagined that the usually dignified Perfected Xuanchen was so good at coaxing children. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

It looked like Perfected Xuanchen was getting along well with little You Yun.

However…

Little You Yun was just too easy to coax. A stick of candy and she was content…

Perfected Xuanchen and Ye Qingtang swiftly brought little You Yun out of the house.

“Go ahead…” Perfected Xuanchen gently patted little You Yun’s small head.

Little You Yun batted her eyelids and stepped forward.

The next second, little You Yun’s eyes slowly turned green, and an indescribable aura surged forth from her body.

In a split second, the spirit energy in the void sank. An immense amount of spirit energy visibly accumulated in the void above. The density of the spirit energy far exceeded the limit of this mainland.

“This… is a miracle…” Perfected Xuanchen looked at the spirit energy in the void above. Although he had seen it once, he could not help but exclaim again.

When Ye Qingtang saw this amazing scene, a trace of wonder involuntarily surfaced in her eyes.

This mainland was created from the extraordinary lady’s Spiritual Abode. In a sense, in this mainland, the extraordinary lady was equivalent to a creator god. It was entirely possible that she possessed a supreme power that allowed her to control the spirit energy.

Further, little You Yun had some intricate connection with the extraordinary lady. Although her ability to control this mainland’s spirit energy was beyond Ye Qingtang’s expectations, it was also within reason.

When she saw this scene, an idea suddenly surfaced in Ye Qingtang’s mind.

“If… little You Yun could send spirit energy into a cultivator’s body…”

Little You Yun heard Ye Qingtang murmur.

Little You Yun tilted her head and glanced at Ye Qingtang. Her eyes flickered.

Then, she looked at Perfected Xuanchen as if she had suddenly thought of something. Her eyes flashed.
