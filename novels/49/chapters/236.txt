Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Wu Chengze was still absorbed in the evil spirit’s resurrection, but the infatuated expression on his face turned into a terrified one when he was suddenly in Ye Qingtang’s hands.

“Stop!” Ye Qingtang shouted coldly.

Only then did everyone in the battle notice that Ye Qingtang actually held Wu Chengze in her hands without their knowledge.

In just a moment, everyone in Spirit Condensation Mountain Village stopped their attack.

Ye Qingtang watched everyone vigilantly as the sword that she held against Wu Chengze’s neck remained glued on his skin.

“Let’s leave, Senior Sister Lin,” Ye Qingtang said while looking straight ahead.

Lin Long took a deep breath and rushed to Ye Qingtang’s side. On the other hand, Zhou Xuan took this opportunity to dash over and even fled out of the door without waiting for Ye Qingtang at all!

Lin Long glared at Zhou Xuan’s back view, and disgust emerged in her eyes.

“Ignore him,” Ye Qingtang muttered after sensing Lin Long’s disgust.

She had no energy to bother with that idiot, Zhou Xuan, now.

“Don’t let them leave! Leave me alone. I have given my everything to my Master. If I can die for Master, it will be my greatest honor!” Suddenly, completely unafraid of Ye Qingtang’s threats, Wu Chengze, who was under Ye Qingtang’s control, gave a shocking declaration loudly.

Everyone from Spirit Condensation Mountain Village was taken aback, and before they could react, Ye Qingtang suddenly raised her hand and stabbed it right in Wu Chengze’s temple fiercely. Fresh blood gushed out. Wu Chengze lost all consciousness in a moment and passed out.

Ye Qingtang lifted the unconscious Wu Chengze away and scoffed while looking up at the masses.

“Village Master Wu is really devout. However, if you all want him to die in front of you, you can continue,” Ye Qingtang said calmly. No one knew… she was also taking a gamble.

An evil spirit which just resurrected was not too agile in his movements, and if they escaped now, they still had a chance of survival.

Wu Chengze’s infatuation with the Blood Moon Sect shocked Ye Qingtang. However, she had no choice but to take a gamble. She could only gamble with Wu Chengze’s life and see whether the people in Spirit Condensation Mountain Village were as crazy as him.

And this time…

Ye Qingtang won the gamble.

After seeing Ye Qingtang knock Wu Chengze out, everyone from Spirit Condensation Mountain Village had an angry and fearful expression, but no one dared to step forward. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Ye Qingtang’s lips curled into a smile. Nodding at Lin Long, both of them dragged the unconscious Wu Chengze as they walked out.

The people from Spirit Condensation Mountain Village did not dare to follow too closely and could only watch Ye Qingtang and Lin Long leave the hall step by step.

However…

Watching its offerings leaving gradually, the evil spirit in the hall suddenly let out a shrill cry. The sound was extremely piercing, and as it growled, huge blood fog spat out from its mouth which filled the entire hall. Along with the air, the blood fog was sucked into everyone’s lungs!

In just a flash, the people who took a breath of the blood fog felt that all blood was drained instantly. Everyone’s complexion turned strangely pale while their clear eyes were covered by a layer of haze.

All the people from Spirit Condensation Mountain Village felt a tremor throughout their body, and in the next second, they chased out with a howl like zombies that had lost all rationality!
