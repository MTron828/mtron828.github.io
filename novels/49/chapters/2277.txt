It was only after Ye Qingtang completely absorbed the Evil Fruit’s energy that she opened her eyes.

Opening her hands, she found that the Evil Fruit had disappeared, as if it had never existed.

Suddenly, the black snake stopped banging against the wall. It appeared somewhat dazed. Swaying its head a little, it suddenly turned and slithered back to the treasure trove.

“What happened? Why did it leave? Don’t tell me there are others who have barged into the treasure trove?” Ye Qingtang stared at the departing black snake in surprise. She felt somewhat confused. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

By the side, the Night Soul Beast glanced at Ye Qingtang before lifting one paw and gestured at the empty space between her hands.

Ye Qingtang instantly understood the Night Soul Beast’s hint.

“You are saying that the Evil Fruit is gone so the black snake has lost its target?” Ye Qingtang asked.

The Night Soul Beast nodded,

It finally understood that this human was too sly. Now that the black snake had run off, it was near-impossible for it to try and cause her death now.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes lit up.

But she didn’t dare to fully believe the Night Soul Beast. Although the black snake had left, who knew if it was just a pretense to try and lure her out.

Ye Qingtang placed caution above all. She did not intend to leave immediately. She had to observe for a further period of time first, to make sure that the black snake had really departed.

As she waited and examined her Heart of the Heavenly Dao situation. The seal was fully repaired and it should be able to hold for at least half a year.

“It is indeed a treasure left behind by the fiendcelestial. Very effective.”

Ye Qingtang stretched and inadvertently realized that she seemed to have gained a strange power.

“Don’t tell me that by absorbing that Evil Fruit, not only can it form a seal, it can also increase my power?” Ye Qingtang was surprised.

But she soon realized that the new power inside her body gave off a different feeling than the Evil Fruit. They were two completely different energies.

What was going on?

Glancing down, Ye Qingtang’s gaze landed on the array formation on the floor. Was she imagining things, or did the array formation seem to exude a faint glow now?

Ye Qingtang had an idea. She circulated the spirit energy inside her body and tried to cultivate it. Since the energy didn’t come from the Evil Fruit, that meant it could only have come from this secret room.

Even the black snake couldn’t enter this secret room. So it could be seen just how much power it possessed. If she was correct, this array formation was the key.

Ye Qingtang started cultivating. She didn’t close her eyes this time and saw everything that happened with the array formation.

Wisps of foggy mist rose continuously from the array formation and were absorbed into Ye Qingtang’s body.

That new power in her body became increasingly thick. In addition, as she cultivated, that strange energy was gradually being transformed and completely absorbed into her body.

Even more astonishing was that the energy was very pure. She had never experienced something like that before. In just a few seconds, she could already feel an intense feeling from the energy she had absorbed.

She had been suppressing her cultivation stage and storing her excess powers. If she didn’t do that, that bit of energy she had absorbed would be enough for her break through a Heaven level.

What kind of formidable array formation was that?

So remarkable?

“Don’t tell me this is also something left behind by the fiendcelestial?” Ye Qingtang’s eyes lit up. She had really come across a real treasure this time!
