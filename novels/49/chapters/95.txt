Chapter 96: Path to Heaven (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The Path to Heaven was laid only for people in a sect. If one could not even walk on the path stably, it would not be possible for them to enter a sect.

It was the simplest step, but also the beginning of a sect assessment.

No one dared to go forward, as they were deeply afraid that they would miss such a rare chance due to a small mistake.

However…

Where could they step on in this beam of light?

Everyone did not dare to step forward and instead fell into a dead silence at that moment.

However…

A thin figure stepped out from the silent crowd and walked to under the holy light.

Ye Qingtang stood at the starting point of the Path to Heaven with an unusually calm heart as she looked at the light that connected to the skyline.

Xuanling Sect, she was back again.

In the next instant, Ye Qingtang raised her feet gently with a calm expression. When her toes stepped into the light, a gold halo formed into a golden lotus under her feet, supporting the feet when it landed.

“A lotus with every step?!” Shock filled everyone’s eyes as they looked at the translucent golden lotus, that was about the size of a palm, under Ye Qingtang’s feet.

However, Ye Qingtang did not pay attention to those people and only quietly walked up the Path to Heaven that she could not be more familiar with.

Everyone was taken aback on the side as they looked at Ye Qingtang walk into the holy light as if she was walking on flat ground. Wherever she raised her leg, a lotus flower would bloom. The lotuses, which were higher level by level, were like steps laid out one by one, appearing when Ye Qingtang’s foot was going to land and disappearing without a trace when she stepped off.

Looking from afar, it was as if Ye Qingtang was floating in midair as she stepped on the golden lotuses with holy light showering on her.

Such a miraculous scene stunned many candidates, and even those who accompanied the candidates there with no good impressions of Ye Qingtang were surprised by Ye Qingtang’s collectedness.

She was so calm and collected as though she was walking this path for the umpteenth time.

In the blink of an eye, Ye Qingtang was already ten meters away from the ground. Everyone returned to their senses from the surprise and immediately got moving. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Those who were previously afraid to step forward rushed up instantly, imitated Ye Qingtang, and walked up in the holy light.

When the first lotus formed under their feet, many hearts fluttered, and they instinctively raised another leg to continue walking up.

However…

Thump!

The person who was the most anxious stepped on air as the lotus under his feet disappeared, falling right on the floor.

“What happened?” A look of confusion was seen on the person who fell. He clearly saw the lotus forming under his feet. Why, then, was did it disappear when he stepped down?

All the subsequent people who went forward could not proceed a step further and fell down after at most two or three steps. They did not manage to walk up the Path to Heaven and fell to become a muddy mess instead. Everyone felt gloomy instantly.

Why could Ye Qingtang walk up the Path to Heaven so easily, but they’re so battered up?

Yun Shu did not rush to go forward. Only after observing for a moment, he took a few deep breaths, calmed his heart, and stepped onto the Path to Heaven.

A lotus bloomed under his foot. Although it was slightly unstable, it became stable very quickly. Yun Shu finally became the second person who walked up the Path to Heaven, though his speed was much slower than Ye Qingtang’s. Every step he took was with extreme caution.

Lu Xiuwen’s face turned ugly. He tried to step on the Path to Heaven earlier on and almost fell as well. Dissatisfaction flashed in his eyes as he saw that Ye Qingtang had already walked into the cloud mist.
