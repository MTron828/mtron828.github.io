Chapter 1825: Fire Demon (3)

No matter how quickly she tried to escape, the Fire Demons faster. Even at five meters tall, they quickly caught up with Ye Qingtang and Little White Tiger.

“Quick, throw this little rascal over.” Seeing the three mutant Fire Demons right on their tails, Little White Tiger rushed towards Ye Qingtang and swiped Little Heavenly Demon from her arms with his mouth.

Swinging its head hard, it threw Little Heavenly Demon towards the three mutant Fire Demons!

Ye Qingtang was completely dumbstruck.

She knew that Little White Tiger and Little Heavenly Demon didn’t always see eye to eye, but to throw it over to distract their pursuers...

The three Fire Demons dodged Little Heavenly Demon as though it wasn’t there at all and continued chasing after Ye Qingtang and the Little White Tiger.

Little White Tiger was left speechless.

What had just happened?

“Are you an idiot? Why would the Fire Demons attack Little Heavenly Demon of their own accord?” Ye Qingtang was completely stupefied at what the Little White Tiger had just done.

“I just wanted to make that little rascal useful. How would I know that it’s so stupid it didn’t even know to attack those three?” Little White Tiger groused.

“That little guy’s greatest use right now is its roar. But it obviously has no effect on the three mutant Fire Demons, so what did you throw it over for?” With that, Ye Qingtang smacked Little White Tiger on the head.

It was lucky that the three mutant Fire Demons had not attacked Little Heavenly Demon or Ye Qingtang would’ve killed him!

How could he betray his own team like this?

But she had no time to argue with Little White Tiger right now. Looking at the Fire Demons rapidly approaching them, she could only flee as fast as she could.

Seeing the fleeing figures, the three mutant Fire Demons howled. Three huge pillars of flames shot out from their mouths straight towards Ye Qingtang and Little White Tiger.

Looking at the approaching flames, Ye Qingtang knew that she had no way of avoiding it. Having no choice, she grabbed Little White Tiger, tucking him safely in her chest, and released her energy.

A huge wall of black flames appeared behind her and met with the three huge pillars of flames.

BANG!

A huge explosion reverberated through the air as the flames of the Fire Demons and Ye Qingtang’s black flames collided with sparks flying all over.

Even though Ye Qingtang had the broken piece of the key to protect her body, she could still feel her temperature rising rapidly. The mutant Fire Demons’ flames were gradually suppressing her black flames. It was clear they were determined to burn her and Little White Tiger to death.

As the threat of death got closer to them, Ye Qingtang gritted her teeth and reached for the power of the Deity Ocean within her. In the blink of an eye, Little White Tiger and her entered the twisted space.

But the moment Ye Qingtang activated the Deity Ocean, the power sleeping within her all this while suddenly awoke.

In the next second, Ye Qingtang felt sudden heat enveloping her whole body. The heat was quickly swallowed by her black flames, and her black flames quickly dissolved into a scattering of gold flakes.

The moment the black flame transformed, the power of the black flame increased greatly and changed when it met the Fire Demons’ flames. The black flame which had been suppressed all this time seemed to be absorbing the Fire Demons’ flames and becoming more powerful. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Who knew that the black flames could devour the Fire Demons’ flames?

Ye Qingtang couldn’t believe her eyes. It was at the moment that she realized where the warmth within her was coming from.

“What’s that?”

It was changing to the power of the Devouring Bloodline!
