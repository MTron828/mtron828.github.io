1322 Justice Before Family 3

Even ten Eldest Princes were no match for Ling Yan.

Ling Yan was probably all prepared and had clearly expected everything that happened today.

It must be admitted that Ye Qingtang wanted to laugh when she saw Mo Yunxian’s crushed look…

No one had expected Ling Yan to accuse General Mo.

Even Mo You and the others were implicated because they were close to Mo Yunxian. Wu Liang and the others were Ling Yan’s trusted subordinates, but because of their connection with Mo You and the Mo Family, they were close to the Mo Family, and now, they were unable to extricate themselves.

Also, Mo Yunxian had led them away after they had committed the crimes. From start to finish, Ling Yan had not involved himself in the matter.

This deepened the impression that they had transferred their loyalties to the Mo Family and that the trouble they had caused had nothing to do with Ling Yan. Instead, it cast the spotlight on Mo Yunxian’s presumptuousness and the Mo Family’s arrogance in its achievements.

“Imprison Mo Yunxian and the others.” The Eternal Emperor took a deep breath and resolutely issued the command. He also sent men with troops to arrest General Mo, who had just returned to the capital.

“Elder Brother Yan… Elder Brother Yan…” Mo Yunxian frantically sought Ling Yan’s help before she was dragged away, her beautiful little face filled with terror. But Ling Yan had not even glanced at her throughout this incident.

Mo Yunxian had not imagined that Ling Yan would treat her so viciously.

When Mo Yunxian and the others had been taken away and imprisoned, Ling Yan said, “Royal Father, I am guilty. Although I did not participate in the Mo Family’s matters, Mo Yunxian and I are engaged…”

Before Ling Yan could finish speaking, the Eternal Emperor waved his arm.

“This engagement is my fault. I made the engagement for you years ago but did not expect the Mo Family to harbor such wicked ambitions. I have picked the right person. You have taken on everything by yourself and have given priority to national matters without showing any bias. You have done very well in this matter. Your engagement with Mo Yunxian is dissolved. In the future, the two of you have no connection whatsoever. You need not worry about this.” The Eternal Emperor looked pleased. Ling Yan had managed this matter flawlessly. He was even more pleased that Ling Yan had chosen justice over family for the sake of the nation.

“This is the kind of boldness and courage a Crown Prince of our Eternal Dynasty should display.”

The Eternal Emperor was full of praise, unaware that the Eldest Prince’s and Second Princess’s expressions had darkened.

Their careful plans had been completely overturned by Ling Yan.

Unexpectedly…

Not only had they failed to trap Ling Yan, but their actions caused Ling Yan to appear even more virtuous in the eyes of the Eternal Emperor and the ministers.

Ling Yan’s status as the Crown Prince had been shaky, but after this incident, the entire court and the Eternal Emperor would recognize Ling Yan’s status as the Crown Prince.

The three of them finally had a taste of what it meant to try to gain an advantage and end up worse off.

“You must be tired. Go back and rest,” the Eternal Emperor said with a smile. Today, the more he looked at Ling Yan, the more delighted he grew.

Ling Yan smiled and rose.

“Then I will take my leave.”

As he spoke, Ling Yan turned to leave. When he walked past Ye Qingtang, his footsteps seemed to pause.

Ye Qingtang pretended not to notice. She hid behind her whiskers and pretended to be entirely absorbed elsewhere.

Ling Yan’s lips curved in a faint smile. A moment later, he strode away.

Ling Yan had won a complete victory in today’s battle.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m
