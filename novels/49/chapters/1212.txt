1213 I Will Take On This Tribulation For You 1

Ye Qingtang landed on a yellow cliff in the mountain range. She stumbled and gently placed little Luo Xue and little You Yun on the ground.

The moment she set the children down, she suddenly vomited a large mouthful of blood. The blood that sprayed out immediately stained the ground at her feet red.

The little white tiger frantically jumped out of Ye Qingtang’s robes. It studied Ye Qingtang carefully, its eyes filled with worry.

“You…” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Before little white tiger could speak, Ye Qingtang used the last of her strength to say,

“Take… take them away from this mainland.”

“F*ck, don’t talk like that. We’ll go together!” The little white tiger immediately enlarged itself and prepared to bring Ye Qingtang with it.

However, Ye Qingtang shakily retreated. She looked at the little white tiger, and a bitter smile surfaced on her face. She shook her head. “No need… it’s too late… My meridians and internal organs… are all shattered…”

The power of a Heavenly Venerate had shattered all her internal organs, and she had lost all her martial cultivation.

Ye Qingtang had lasted until now by the sheer strength of her will.

Ye Qingtang was aware of her own state. She had no strength to return to the void. She slowly sat on the ground and painfully raised her hand to wipe the traces of blood away from her lips. Ling Yan’s image came to her mind unbidden.

That jinx. He was right…

Or perhaps she had reached the end of this life.

“F*ck! I said I’m bringing you, so that’s it!” White tiger bellowed with rage. It tried to pick Ye Qingtang up with its mouth but was unsure of where to grip her.

Ye Qingtang’s state was such that any movement would only hasten her death…

“Take them… and go…” Ye Qingtang looked at the little white tiger and smiled. “Little white one… thank you… for taking care of me all this while.”

“You…”

At that moment, the awe-inspiring tiger was at a loss for words.

“Go quickly… or… it will be too late…” Ye Qingtang tried to smile but discovered that she lacked the energy to do so.

“Alright… I know… I’ll take them and go…” The little white tiger curled its tail and tossed little Luo Xue and little You Yun onto its back. It glanced back at Ye Qingtang and then turned to leave.

Ye Qingtang finally relaxed when she saw the little white tiger vanish into the distance.

Ye Qingtang slowly sat down on a rock and enjoyed her last moments. Her mind was in a whirl. It was as if her life flashed past her in that instant.

Her mind slowly started to blur, and her vision vanished.

…

In Central Mainland, in the Eternal Dynasty.

On a snowy mountain top, a green-robed man stood with his hands clasped behind his back. His remote eyes seemed to encompass everything in the universe.

“Ling Yan… you must not do it!” The little azure dragon looked at the green-robed man and said frantically. It had thought that everything would go smoothly after Ling Yan came out of prison, but it had not foreseen that…

However, Ling Yan did not respond. A karmic natal chart instantly surfaced.

Ye Qingtang’s natal chart was at its end.

When Ye Qingtang had first obtained the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix, her natal chart had changed. The Heart of the Heavenly Dao had been sealed by the Divine Phoenix, which meant that Ye Qingtang was fated to face a death tribulation.

Ling Yan swiftly exchanged his complicated natal chart with Ye Qingtang’s natal chart…

“Ling Yan… are you really doing this for her… is it worth it?!” The little azure dragon looked at Ling Yan in shock.
