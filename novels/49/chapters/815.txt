Chapter 816 Master (2)

“I know,” Perfected Xuanchen said.

“You know?” A look of surprise could be seen on Ye Qingtang’s face.

“Chen, everyone says that there’s a sea of clouds at Mount Qin on this mainland. When I was young, I’ve been on that road once to pay a visit to the historical site and search for the whereabouts of the sea of clouds at Mount Qin. However, the sea of clouds was the end, and there was no Mount Qin to be seen.” Perfected Xuanchen looked at Ye Qingtang and smiled.

Ye Qingtang did not know whether the sea of clouds at Mount Qin existed in this mainland, but she never thought that Perfected Xuanchen had actually walked to the end of the sea of clouds…

Perfected Xuanchen never married anyone, and others knew that he was devoted to martial cultivation.

However, no one knew that he once liked someone as well; that person was his little junior sister, and both of them were in love with each other.

His little junior sister carried his child, and he originally intended to marry her. Yet, unexpectedly…

Life was unpredictable. On the day of his little junior sister’s day of labor, she died of difficult labor and only left a daughter behind…

From then on, Perfected Xuanchen never had any interest in any girls and was fully focused on martial cultivation as well as raising his daughter.

Ten years ago, Perfected Xuanchen’s only daughter was severely injured, and even the most skilled physicians on this mainland were unable to treat her.

As the last ray of hope, Perfected Xuanchen wanted to search for the sea of clouds at Mount Qin to look for the powerful ancient clans which concealed themselves from the world. Even if it meant risking his life, he still wished to plead for a mythical medicine from the ancient clan to save his daughter.

However…

After Perfected Xuanchen found the sea of clouds, he realized that it was already the end and that there was no Mount Qin on this world at all. Everything was merely a beautiful legend.

“So why… did you not expose me back then?” Ye Qingtang had a strange expression.

“Expose you?” Perfected Xuanchen seemed to be even more surprised than Ye Qingtang. “You are my disciple. Why would I want to expose you?”

Looking at Perfected Xuanchen’s strictness, Ye Qingtang suddenly laughed from the bottom of her heart.

“Master, please.”

In the next second, Ye Qingtang had finished grinding ink for Perfected Xuanchen and said with a smile.

Shaking his head rather helplessly, Perfected Xuanchen dipped the brush in the ink and continued reviewing the files.

Master went to the sea of clouds at Mount Qin to search for the hidden ancient clans… probably for his only daughter…

Ye Qingtang pondered in her heart as she watched Perfected Xuanchen concentrate on reviewing the files.

Although Ye Qingtang never heard Perfected Xuanchen mentioning this matter in her previous life, she heard about it from Gu Yihan.

Perfected Xuanchen’s only daughter was born by his love and was named as Xuan Yue.

Ten years ago, Xuan Yue was claimed to be the number one beauty in Nine Nights Dynasty. She was only sixteen then, but her appearance was already stunning. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Yet, it was her good looks that a Peerless School disciple took a fancy on, and he tried courting her many times.

However, that Peerless School disciple had a notorious reputation, liked toying with females the most, and was even a regular of brothels. Thus, naturally, Xuan Yue would not agree.

Ultimately, that Peerless School disciple suppressed Xuan Yue with his martial skills before toying with and humiliating her.

Once Perfected Xuanchen found Xuan Yue, she was already heavily injured, both physically and mentally, and was also pregnant…

Although Perfected Xuanchen used his internal energy and many healing medicines to extend Xuan Yue’s life, she eventually died when Perfected Xuanchen was heading to the sea of clouds at Mount Qin along with that unborn baby.
