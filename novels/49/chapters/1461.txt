“So what? We have so many people. Will we be unable to break through this barrier? Once the barrier is broken, we can kill Mo Yi and Ye Qingtang,” Jiang Qin said.

Elder Meng shook his head.

“This is a barrier passed down by the Ancient Dynasty. The price is too high if we break it. However, this barrier consumes too much energy. That Mo Yi was injured by me just now. Given her current condition, she will not be able to sustain this barrier for long. We just need to wait.”

Jiang Qin hesitated for a moment and finally stopped.

After Mo Yi brought the people into the room, she immediately spat out a mouthful of blood, and her fragile frame was unstable.

Ye Qingtang hurriedly helped to steady Mo Yi.

“Mother!”

Mo Yi squinted her eyes and wiped the blood at the corner of her lips. “I was careless for a moment.”

Subsequently, Mo Yi looked at Ye Qingtang worryingly and brushed the sinister look in her eyes away. “Tang Tang, I will send you all out from the back door later. You don’t need to return. You just need to head to the mountain thirty miles away to look for your father. He should be there.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Mo Yi’s voice was extremely gentle, but what she said stunned Ye Qingtang.

“I’m not leaving.” Ye Qingtang faintly felt that Mo Yi seemed to be addressing her post-death matters.

“Don’t be foolish. Those people outside racked their brains to take my life. I don’t mind playing with them, but I will be worried if you’re beside me,” Mo Yi said with a smile.

Ye Qingtang did not believe a single word she said.

If Mo Yi really could deal with Jiang Shun and the rest, she would not have retreated into the room.

“Mother, don’t lie to me. I am already an adult,” Ye Qingtang said.

Mo Yi was slightly surprised, but she sighed softly.

It was then that Ye Qingtang noticed a streak of black blood on Mo Yi’s pale face. Her eyes became pitch-black, and the white of the eye was completely absent.

“Madam…” The heavily-wounded demon fox servants saw Mo Yi’s behavior and took out that medicine gourd strenuously.

Mo Yi shook her head, however.

That medicine could only be used for daily nourishment. She had already suffered a huge deficit and still needed to sustain the barrier. How could she consume it?

The demon fox servants lowered their head and clenched their fists tightly as they hated themselves for being incapable.

“Mother, what exactly is wrong with your body?” Ye Qingtang’s eyes were filled with worry.

“Tang Tang, do you know why the grand Ancient Dynasty declined back then?” Mo Yi suddenly asked.

Ye Qingtang shook her head. Including her, the entire Central Mainland had very little understanding of the Ancient Dynasty.

“The royals of the Ancient Dynasty were supreme powerful figures, and they are not in the least inferior even if they were in the current age. This is all reliant on the Netherworld Bloodline of my clan,” Mo Yi said.

“Netherworld Bloodline?” Ye Qingtang was surprised.

The Netherworld Bloodline was an extremely rare and immensely powerful bloodline.

It was rumored that the Netherworld Bloodline came from the God of the Netherworld. He was a god that drifted between life and death and found joy in death.

Anyone who possessed the Netherworld Bloodline could use the God of the Netherworld’s powers and become exceptionally powerful, but one would have to pay the price with their lives every time they used his powers.

The more frequent the usage, the shorter one’s lifespan.

At this moment, Ye Qingtang finally realized the reason behind the Ancient Dynasty’s fall.

Perhaps they were powerful, but their power was at the cost of their lifespan.

Moreover, it was rumored that it was extremely tough for those with the Netherworld Bloodline to reproduce; thus, this also resulted in the difficulty for the Ancient Dynasty to prolong.
