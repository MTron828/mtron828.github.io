Chapter 1720: The Cursed Mystic Realm (3)

“At that time, he and over a hundred powerful practitioners forced their way through the Freezing Ice Fields and Scorching Hot Lands to finally reach the Cemetery of the True Gods. But in the end, only this lone skull of his returned. Little girl, I warn you, just stay here. If it is really that easy to leave, why would we be all trapped here like this for tens of thousands of years?” Yuan Di spoke up.

“Since there is hope, why shouldn’t I fight for it? No matter how terrible the consequences, it will just be slightly worse off than staying here forever.” Ye Qingtang could tell that this mystic realm was a very frightening place, but the thought of waiting here for eternity until her flesh rotted away to bare bones—this was something she absolutely could not withstand.

Everyone in the First Mainland was still waiting for her. How could she remain trapped here in this manner?

The rest of the skeletons didn’t comment on Ye Qingtang’s statement. None of them expressed any approval.

“Thank you for your help.” Ye Qingtang offered her thanks to the skull respectfully. Even though he was not willing to lead her there, he already told her how to leave this place.

“It looks like you won’t change your mind.” The skull chuckled. “Never mind, if you wish to go, just put me back in my cave. I have already seen all I want to see today.”

So Ye Qingtang followed the skull’s instructions and placed him back in the cave. Then she picked up Little White Tiger and was about to leave when she found Qin Zhuo standing right before her.

“Senior Qin,” Ye Qingtang greeted Qin Zhuo respectfully.

Qin Zhuo’s pitch-black eye sockets bore into Ye Qingtang. He suddenly raised his hand and held out his Sword of Destruction to her.

“Senior Qin, what are you doing?” Ye Qingtang was taken aback.

“This sword has been by my side for tens of thousands of years. I will never leave this place, so I am handing it over to you now. If you are able to leave here someday, please bring it to the Qin family in the Second Domain, and hand it over to my descendants,” Qin Zhuo said.

Qin Zhuo’s meaning was clear. After all, he was already a skeleton and even if he could leave this place, he would immediately die. The only reason he was alive in this skeletal state was because of the curse.

Ye Qingtang finally understood why Qin Zhuo helped her earlier.

“I will definitely fulfil your request if I am able to leave this place.” Ye Qingtang accepted the Sword of Destruction and carefully placed this highly-coveted weapon into her space ring.

Qin Zhuo nodded and turned to leave.

Ye Qingtang immediately called out, “Senior Qin.”

Qin Zhuo paused.

“If the curse is broken, what will happen to you all...”

“Don’t worry about it,” Qin Zhuo replied mildly.

His words made her relax somewhat. She carried Little White Tiger and left the canyon. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

After knowing the dangers of this mystic realm, Ye Qingtang was even more anxious to leave this place. If she stayed here for too long, she would probably end up becoming a bare skeleton like Qin Zhuo and the others.

Ye Qingtang realized that the raging winds had already simmered down when she left the canyon. What she most urgently had to do now was to find Jiang Shaobai and the rest, and tell them everything she had just learned.

No matter what kind of relationship they had outside, faced with such a terrifying mystic realm, they had no choice but to rely on each other.
