Chapter 2013: The Demon Clan Disaster (1)

Ye Qingtang had no intention of holding on to this hot potato. Besides... The Spirit of Chaos was worthless if even one piece was missing.

As far as she was aware, no one knew where the shard that the Holy Lord of Shadows had taken with her was.

Seemingly satisfied with her answer, Mi faded back into the shadows with a nod. He left so silently that Ye Qingtang wouldn’t even have noticed that he was there if he hadn’t spoken up.

The Ghost Clan was rare even in the Second Domain and Ye Qingtang didn’t know much about them. All she knew was... not many people dared anger them in the Second Domain.

Just as she had gotten rid of Mi, the Northstar Demon Lord suddenly rushed in from the entrance.

“Holy Lord! I have a request for you.” The huge figure suddenly knelt in front of her as he looked at her seriously.

“What is it?” she asked.

“Please save my Northland Demon Tribe!” the Northstar Demon Lord said earnestly.

“Northland Demon Tribe?” she asked as her brows raised slightly.

There were many demon tribes in the Central Mainland and the Northland Demon Tribe was one of them. It was where the Northstar Demon Lord originated.

Many demon tribes had chosen to follow the Ancient You Clan when they had been expanding their power but the Northland Demon Tribe had not.

“Holy Lord, the demon tribes following the Ancient You Clan have already invaded my Northland Demon Tribe where they burnt, robbed, killed and committed all sorts of evil. In a short period of time, they have already killed and hurt many of the demons there. I beg the Holy Lord to intervene and save my Demon Tribe!” He said urgently.

“What is happening?” Ye Qingtang was shocked as the Ancient You Clan’s main targets were the various Ancient Clans. The demon tribes and dynasties rarely participated in fights and most of the invasions were done by the other powers who had joined the Ancient You Clan.

But this didn’t seem to be the case based on what the demon lord was saying.

He explained everything to Ye Qingtang.

The Northland Demon Tribe was rather far away and the demons there rarely left the place. It was a place where demons were safe and where it was hard to fight.

Back when demons had started to follow the Ancient You Clan and began invading other demon territories, they hadn’t put much pressure on the Northland Demon Tribe.

But in recent times, the Ancient You Clan had started attacking them. They had attacked in huge numbers, and the Northland Demon Tribe which was used to peace had no time to respond to this sudden attack.

“Those traitors! Forget it if they want to follow the Ancient You Clan, but how could they harm their own? They’ve taken many of our young demons and I’m not sure if they’re still alive...” The Northstar Demon Lord’s face was crestfallen.

In fact, he had already brought many of his comrades to seek the protection of the Temple of Shadows in the early days when the tribes were starting to join the Ancient You Clan. But the remaining demons had been unwilling to leave and had no choice but to submit to the Ancient You Clan.

They had thought that they would be safe if they submitted to the Ancient You Clan and had not expected the demons following them to invade and take away the demons which had yet to grow up. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“What do they do with the demon cubs?” Ye Qingtang couldn’t push away the feeling that something was off.

“I’m not sure.” the Northstar Demon Lord said.
