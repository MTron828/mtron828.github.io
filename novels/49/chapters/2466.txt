Everyone looked at each other in shock and did not know what to say.

Why were they so unlucky to have bumped into a demon? And this demon too…

Seeing that this demon’s strength was very low and didn’t know any martial art techniques and divine abilities, they had thought that they had struck gold.

Who would have thought that they had actually stumbled upon the worst of misfortunes? This ordinary demon had a tracking mark on its body. According to Ye Qingtang, it was very likely that it was the son of a demon tribe general!

At this moment, their bodies had been imprinted with tracking marks. It would not be long before the demon’s tribe would send their men to hunt them down.

“Teacher Ye Qing, can you bring us out of this space before the demon tribe hunts us down?” Lu Yuanxiang looked at Ye Qing.

Everyone turned to look at Ye Qing. He was everyone’s only hope now.

However, Ye Qingtang shook her head and frowned deeply. “I’m afraid that’s not possible. It will take a few days before we can leave this realm. Now that we are marked with a tracking mark, how long do you think it will take for the demon tribe to find us and kill us?”

Ye Qing’s words were like a gush of cold water splashing down on everyone’s faces.

Indeed, they had witnessed the strength of those demons with their very eyes. Not a single of those demons was something they could fend against, let alone the entire tribe.

“Boss, what should we do?” Nangong Lie looked at Ye Qing and said hurriedly, “Boss, I’m not afraid of death but I can’t accept being skinned alive!”

Ye Qingtang glanced at Nangong Lie and did not say anything. Instead, she thought of a countermeasure. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

A direct confrontation with the demon tribe was equivalent to a moth flying into a flame. They would just be courting death. Moreover, they had been marked with the tracking mark. As long as they were still in this realm, the demon tribe would find them no matter where they fled to.

Unless…

The demon tribe could not be bothered with them. Then they would not pursue them.

But, was that even possible?!

“Under what circumstances would the demons not pursue us?” Mu Ziying looked at Qin Feng, who was also deep in thought.

Qin Feng raised his head when he heard this and said, “If I was a demon, I wouldn’t pursue someone stronger than me.”

Lei Yan couldn’t help but roll his eyes at Qin Feng. “You’re simply spouting nonsense. If we’re stronger than the demons, would we still be afraid of being pursued by them?!”

“Then… how does the demon tribe know our strength? The tracking mark can only track our location, but it cannot determine our strength.” The Flying Star Academy teacher suddenly spoke up.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes lit up when she heard their discussion.

Right now, the only way to survive was to successfully escape the demons’ pursuit. However, Ye Qingtang had not thought of how to make the demons fearful and give up the thought of pursuing them.

After all, it was impossible for the demons to retreat without a fight. Even if they did not know the strength of the opponent, they had to at least see the target before deciding.

If so, they only had one problem left. How to make the demons believe that they were not people to be provoked so that they would give up voluntarily..
