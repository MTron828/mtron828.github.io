Chapter 1344 Illusory Void 1

Ye Qingtang realized something suddenly.

However, it was inconvenient for Ye Qingtang to ask him anything currently.

As the Ancient You Clan people left, the flood that destroyed the Eternal Dynasty also subsided.

After experiencing this flood, the Eternal Dynasty suffered a lot of damage, and much effort was required to rebuild it.

Ling Yan had to settle these matters while Ye Qingtang had to return to the Temple of Shadows.

On the journey back to the Temple of Shadows, Ye Qingtang’s mindset changed a lot as she was aware that she had to secure her identity as the Holy Lord of Shadows in order to borrow the Temple of Shadows’s strength to confront the Ancient You Clan.

Ming Wang observed Ye Qingtang throughout the way back. He was even more uncertain of Ye Qingtang’s identity after this incident.

“Holy Son.” Lady Ghost met Ming Wang individually after returning to the Temple of Shadows.

“Prepare the Illusory Void,” Ming Wang looked down and said slowly.

Lady Ghost was slightly taken aback.

“Illusory Void?”

Ming Wang nodded lightly. Lady Ghost wanted to say something but eventually took her leave without saying anything. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Meanwhile, Ye Qingtang’s mind was bombarded with thoughts. Since she wanted to remain in the Temple of Shadows, she had to consider the steps to take from now on.

Although she could pose as the Holy Lord of Shadows now by imitating her way of speaking and behavior, her skills were ultimately too weak and simply incomparable to those of the Holy Lord of Shadows.

While she could somewhat deal with the situation right now, she would be exposed immediately if she had to use her skills in the future.

Furthermore…

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly.

Even if she was going to borrow the strength of the Temple of Shadows, she may still need to personally attack the Ancient You Clan, which was utterly impossible given her current skills.

It had been some time since she came to the Central Mainland, and she was already exhausted from dealing with the suspicions of the Temple of Shadows. Where was there spare time for cultivation?

Going on like this was not an option.

Just as Ye Qingtang was thinking of ways to raise her cultivation realm, she was suddenly called over by Ming Wang.

He did not say anything much and instead led Ye Qingtang to the Temple of Shadows’s underground palace with Lady Ghost and Ming Gu.

As they passed through the long tunnels, darkness gradually swamped the surroundings as the entire area was lit by only tiny flames.

Ye Qingtang did not know where Ming Wang wanted to bring her to and could only wear a calm expression with the little white tiger in her arms.

She could sense that ever since they returned from the Eternal Dynasty, there was a slight change in Ming Wang’s attitude toward her, and she presumed this to be due to his reduced suspicions of her.

However, it was not that easy for him to believe her completely.

After walking for quite some time and passing endless flights of stairs, they finally reached the end.

Ye Qingtang saw a huge arch in the enormous underground palace.

The arch was tens of meters tall, and its top was unnoticeable in the dimness.

Both sides of the arch were intricately carved with many tiny and strange nebula illustrations while the center of the arch was embedded with a statue of a huge skull.

That skull’s eyes were pitch black, yet they seemed like the abyss of the Netherworld that scrutinized anyone who came near.

Before Ye Qingtang even went near it, she faintly felt a stifling sense of oppression through the crack of the door.

“Ever since you left, this Illusory Void has not been opened,” Ming Wang said slowly as he looked at the nebular arch before him. Nonetheless, his emotionless eyes landed on Ye Qingtang after he finished speaking, seeming to be searching for something.
