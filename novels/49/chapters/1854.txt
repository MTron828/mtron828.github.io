Chapter 1855: Trap (1)

“Really? I won?” Ye Qingtang acted surprised, as if she didn’t know the rules at all.

The fat catfish’s face turned a pitch black, like the underside of a burnt pot.

How could this be?! Originally the fat catfish thought that it had run into a bunch of vulnerable fat sheep, yet he hadn’t anticipated them to have such good luck.

The fat catfish felt really sh*tty inside.

In contrast, Baili Xi and the others were elated. They hadn’t expected Ye Qingtang to have such good luck. She even managed to strike it big.

Ye Qingtang felt somewhat bad as she said, “I’m sorry, I’m unfamiliar with this. It’s my first time playing. Does that mean I’ve won?”

Once Ye Qingtang said that, the fat catfish almost spat out blood.

It was her first time?

So was it because she had very good luck or that he had very bad luck?

The fat catfish felt like dying, but it could only hold in its emotions and nod.

“Yes, you’ve... won.”

Ye Qingtang smiled at him. “Then our stakes...”

The fat catfish’s chest hurt, but it could only bear with the pain and hand the five spirit stones over to Ye Qingtang. Right before it placed the spirit stones down on her palm, it lifted its head and asked,

“Is this really your first time?”

Ye Qingtang nodded. “I swear, this is my first time playing it ‘this lifetime’.”

The fat catfish felt a twinge in its chest. It unwillingly placed the spirit stones down and prepared to leave with a broken heart.

“Hold on, other than the spirit stones, aren’t you also supposed to tell us about the dangers here?” Ye Qingtang hadn’t forgotten about the other conditions of the bet.

The fat catfish paused, turning back to look at Ye Qingtang.

“It’s very dangerous here during the day. If you want to stay alive, find a place and hide in the daytime.”

“It’s very dangerous?” Ye Qingtang was startled.

The fat catfish continued speaking, “Yes. Those who head outside in the daytime would die for no known reason. That’s why we only come out at night...”

The fat catfishes only went outside at night. It wasn’t a personal preference, but rather a habit they had to get accustomed to. It was because scary monsters would appear in the daytime and several fat catfish had died for no known reason. None of them could survive.

“What kind of monster is it?” Ye Qingtang asked.

The fat catfish shook its head. “I don’t know. All I know is that it’s really scary. No one would come back alive when they head out in the daytime. We can’t even find their bodies.

“Remember I told you that the spirit stones are very useful? I wasn’t lying. There aren’t many places to hide and even if you climb a tree and stay up there, you can’t avoid the monsters’ attack.

“We usually build our own holes underground, as for y’all...

“The only way out would be to gather enough spirit stones and go to the Crystal Palace for their protection.”

“Crystal Palace?” Ye Qingtang and the others were confused.

The fat catfish lifted its stubby hand, pointing towards the brightly lit gambling town.

At the very end of it was a colorful palace.

“That’s Fu Qiu’s territory...” Up till this point, the fat catfish couldn’t help but raise the corners of its mouth in disdain.

In order to hide from the dangers in the daytime, the fat catfishes would build underground holes in the daytime and only come out at night.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔
