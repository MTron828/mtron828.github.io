Chapter 215: Skull Tower (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The night before the tragedy was Wu Chengze’s fifty years old birthday celebration. Many guests came, and the celebration lasted until midnight.

The Dongyue family that Wu Zheng mentioned was another prestigious family nearby. There was a rumor that the two families had agreed on the marriage alliance.

Ye Qingtang nodded and did not speak anymore. It seemed that all the questions before were just some random thoughts. After that, besides asking Wu Zheng about the origin of the skulls, there was no further conversation.

Before the sunset, Zhou Xuan and the rest who walked through the entire village were all very pale.

The Spirit Condensation Mountain Village was not small, but the three hundred corpses were everywhere in the village. Everywhere that they could see was covered by blood. The decaying smell made them feel like they were walking in hell.

“Senior Brother Zhou, the situation of the Spirit Condensation Mountain Village… seems to be more complicated than what we thought,” a disciple who vomited many times said.

Zhou Xuan nodded in acknowledgment. Everything they saw today was bloody, but there were no useful clues at all.

“Everyone’s head in the Spirit Condensation Mountain Village was chopped off, and the wound was very neat. There were no traces of fighting beside the corpses. It’s not revenge.”

“If it were revenge, how could they just succumb so easily?”

Zhou Xuan contemplated for a while and looked towards the Lin Long, who was walking at the back. “Junior Sister Lin, did you discover anything?”

Lin Long shook her head.

Zhou Xuan frowned and felt a bit annoyed. How could they accomplish the mission without any clues?

“There are no clues here. What about the skulls?” One of the disciples said.

Zhou Xuan was stunned for a while and then remembered that Ye Qingtang was still in that mountain of skulls. He sneered and said, “We shall see Junior Sister Ye’s investigation results.”

“What can she find out? I don’t think she will be able to find any clues at all. I suppose that she was terrified by the skulls and did not even dare to touch the skulls. Senior Brother Zhou, Ye Qingtang is just a burden. She can’t do anything besides finding more troubles for us.” One of the disciples twitched his mouth and did not expect any results from Ye Qingtang.

“It’s her first time attending a sect mission. We should tolerate her even if she creates some trouble. We are all her Senior Brothers and Senior Sisters, so we must look after her,” Zhou Xuan said with a strong sense of righteousness.

“Senior Brother Zhou, you are too kind to her. She did not feel grateful to your kindness at all,” another disciple said coldly.

Zhou Xuan did not say much. He just waved his hand. “Don’t mention it anymore. We shall go check out the situation at the yard.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

In the eyes of the two disciples, Zhou Xuan was taking care of Ye Qingtang in all perspectives. Even if Ye Qingtang died, they would not find Zhou Xuan suspicious at all.

And this…

This was what Zhou Xuan wanted.

The two disciples were obviously misled by Zhou Xuan’s fake kindness and looked down on Ye Qingtang, who only possessed a red spirit root. The group of people walked into the yard and waited to see Ye Qingtang’s pale and panicking face.

However…

They were shocked by the view in front of them when they reached the yard.
