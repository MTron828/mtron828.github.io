Chapter 2087: Temple of Paragon (3)

The little azure dragon finally understood why Ling Yan was doing all of this.

It wasn’t a coincidence that Ling Yan had appeared in the First Mainland. Even the meeting with Ye Qingtang was planned, he had dragged her into his plan ever since the first time they had met.

“You asked her to impersonate the Holy Lord of Shadows because you already predicted that the Ancient You Clan would use the Spiritual Abode to try and take over the Central Mainland. And in that case, the Temple of Shadows would become everyone else’s last hope. You were using her to collect the Spirit of Chaos fragments?” The little azure dragon put together all the events that had occured to date.

Regardless of whether it was impersonating the Holy Lord of Shadows or seeking help from the Crimson League, weren’t these all suggestions that Ling Yan had given her?

The little azure dragon suddenly thought of something.

“No wonder... You didn’t find it strange at all when she was taken away by the Six-Winged Fire Phoenix. Ling Yan, did you already know that this was going to happen? What exactly are you planning?”

Ling Yan looked at the little azure dragon coming to a realization and his lips curved into a slight smile.

“The Azure Dragon Clan is known for their intelligence. In that case, why don’t you try figuring out what I’m up to?”

The little azure dragon’s mouth twitched. It was only up against him that their clan would take such a blow in their intelligence!

“Even if you did all of this for the Spirit of Chaos fragments, there’s only half of them here. The others...” The little azure dragon was about to remind Ling Yan of this when Ling Yan’s calm expression made him realize something.

He must know where the remaining fragments were hidden!

“Ling Yan, were you helping Ye Qingtang all this time solely for your own goals? Or were you really trying to help her?” the little azure dragon asked. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Ling Yan smiled.

“Take a guess.”

Ling Yan’s smile was mysterious but the little azure dragon’s mind was working wildly. It was easy to say that he was just making use of her, but...

Hadn’t he transferred her death tribulation onto himself?

The death tribulation was already on his karmic natal chart. Despite all his intelligence, it wouldn’t stop it from entering his body.

“I really... don’t understand you.” It was the first time the little azure dragon completely couldn’t understand Ling Yan’s thoughts.

He had planned for so long just to obtain the Spirit of Chaos.

What use did the Spirit of Chaos have to him?

“Since you don’t understand, keep on watching. Someday you’ll get it,” Ling Yan said lightly as he walked out of the Hall of Gloom.

As he passed by the main hall, the little white tiger suddenly flashed past him as it flew into the main hall.

Ye Qingtang had been afraid that the little white tiger would get involved, so she had locked it in her room. It had only managed to escape after knocking down the room door.

Ling Yan looked at the little white tiger’s back and his smile got wider. Without anyone knowing, Ling Yan brought the little azure dragon into the Temple of Shadows.

...

At that very same time, Ye Qingtang was being brought out of the Central Mainland by the Six-Winged Fire Phoenix. She could feel a headache coming on as she looked at her own situation.

“They really look alike,” The indifferent middle-aged man’s eyes landed on Ye Qingtang’s face. His eyes were completely void of emotion and it felt like she was looking at a dead person. Even then, he was closing inspecting her features.
