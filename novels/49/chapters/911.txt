Chapter 912 Demon-Like Intelligence (5)

Feng Wuya’s face was written with shock and terror, up to the moment of his death.

He had never dreamt that he would die here.

As Feng Wuya’s life ebbed away, the trace of aura lingering in his body also dissipated, and the virtual image vanished.

At that moment, in the territory of an ancient clan in Central Mainland, a certain old man’s half-shut eyes suddenly opened. A terrifying aura instantly and completely shrouded the territory of the ancient clan. The weather changed as if even the land was shuddering under the rage of the old man.

“Jiang… Family!”

The old man’s eyes were filled with murderous intent. His voice was like thunder that tore the dark clouds asunder.

Amidst the Dragon Vein forests, when all the disciples of the Supreme Academy and the Divine Virtual Academy saw the tragic way Feng Wuya died, they were all terrified. Their expressions were filled with disbelief.

That was the grandson of the Grand Elder of the ancient Feng Clan!

He had died… just… like that?!

“Finished… finished… finished…” The leader of the youths from the Divine Virtual Academy was as pale as a corpse. His body was drenched in cold sweat. It was as if his entire body had been drained of energy.

Feng Wuya had followed them into the Dragon Vein. Now, Feng Wuya had died tragically on this land. How were they supposed to give an account to the ancient Feng Clan when they returned?!

Everyone from the Divine Virtual Academy was both shocked and terrified. No one dared to make a false move.

Although the ancient Feng Clan was terrifying, the Heavenly Venerate in front of them was equally frightening.

Further, even if the ancient Feng Clan wanted to call them to account, it would only be after they returned to Central Mainland.

But this Heavenly Venerate was right before their eyes!

If she so wished, she could immediately take their lives!

“What a pity…” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Ye Qingtang stared at Feng Wuya, who had died.

On Feng Wuya’s hand was an exquisite space ring.

As the grandson of the Grand Elder of the ancient Feng Clan, Feng Wuya’s space ring would certainly contain unimaginable treasures.

What a pity that as her current status as Heavenly Venerate, she could not snatch away Feng Wuya’s space ring in front of everyone!

If she really did that, it would arouse suspicion.

With that thought, Ye Qingtang’s gaze swept towards the group from the Divine Virtual Academy.

Thump!

Before Ye Qingtang could react, the young man, who was the leader of the Divine Virtual Academy, suddenly knelt on the ground. His face filled with panic as he said, “Senior… Senior Heavenly Venerate, this Feng Wuya was guilty of the most heinous crimes. He forced us all… We had no choice!”

“That’s right, that’s right. We have long been unhappy with that beast, Feng Wuya!”

“Senior Heavenly Venerate, that bastard Feng Wuya used his status as the grandson of the Grand Elder of the ancient Feng Clan to lord it over us. Not to talk about the young and pretty female disciples of the Supreme Academy, even in our Divine Virtual Academy, he forcefully robbed many of our junior and senior sisters of their innocence…”

“Senior Heavenly Venerate, Feng Wuya’s death is not worth mourning over. Senior, you have gotten rid of an evil person. This killing is good, truly good!”

At that moment, everyone from the Divine Virtual Academy was absolutely terrified.

This person had killed Feng Wuya without batting an eye. If she wanted to kill them, would it not be like crushing an ant?

At that moment, they could only plead for her to allow them to live.

Naturally, each of them mustered all their energy to show contempt of Feng Wuya, desperate to sever all connections with him.

“Get lost!”

Ye Qingtang flicked her sleeves. She had no interest in talking nonsense with them.
