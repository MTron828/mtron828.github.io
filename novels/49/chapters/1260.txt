Chapter 1261: What Was Going On? (2) DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

In just a moment, a red gleam enveloped the two powerful figures, and they were ghastly pale after their cultivation bases were completely absorbed by Luo Qufeng.

“This is bad! Luo Qufeng must feel that he cannot defeat the Holy Lord of Shadows and wants to absorb other people’s power to strengthen himself!”

Everyone’s expression changed.

Luo Qufeng was like a hurricane that whirled into the crowd. In no time, he had absorbed the powers of dozens of powerful figures, and his originally-pale face slowly returned to its original complexion.

“Luo Qufeng! You are going too far!”

“Don’t let him absorb our powers! Quickly spread out!”

“Leave quickly! Don’t give him the chance to absorb even more power!”

After finding out Luo Qufeng’s intentions, everyone hurriedly shouted and dispersed, not daring to continue the fight with the Luo Family.

Almost instinctively, everyone bolted towards Ye Qingtang’s location.

In their hearts, they would be safe as long as they hid behind the Holy Lord of Shadows.

After all, the Holy Lord of Shadows was that formidable.

Even those from the Giant Clan were hidden behind Ye Qingtang right now.

When Ye Qingtang witnessed that the people who were initially fighting the Luo Family members with their lives suddenly ran behind her, she almost kicked them to death.

All of them are more skilled than her, but they freaking ran to her for protection?!

While they dispersed quickly, there were still quite a few who were caught by Luo Qufeng and had their cultivation base sucked away.

Luo Qufeng had absorbed the cultivation base of hundreds of powerful figures; thus, his injuries were mostly recovered, and his skills improved further.

“Holy Lord, Luo Qufeng absorbed the powers of others and increased his powers. Please make a move to stop him or else his skills will just continue to increase.” Seeing that Ye Qingtang did not have any intentions to take action, everyone quickly pleaded her to help.

“Holy Lord, Luo Qufeng offended you time and again. You cannot let him off just like that.” A group of powerful figures requested successively.

The guests did not have any connections with the Temple of Shadows and thus were aware that it was a little disrespectful to ask the Holy Lord of Shadows to save them. However, they did not have any choice left…

Obviously, Ye Qingtang knew what these people were thinking. If she had that ability, she would have struck even without them saying.

But the issue was…

She did not have that ability…

Even those powerful figures who were behind her were much more powerful than her.

“Insolent. What is your identity? You don’t have the qualifications to order our Holy Lord!” The Temple of Shadows Hall Master shouted coldly in dissatisfaction.

Everyone was slightly shaken and said hurriedly, “We do not mean to order the Holy Lord. We are just requesting the Holy Lord to make a move.”

“Right, right, right. The Holy Lord is very esteemed, and inferior people like us dare not be disrespectful to the Holy Lord.”

The people were afraid that Ye Qingtang would be displeased and leave immediately. Thus, they hurriedly explained themselves.

“Holy Lord knows what to do and doesn’t need you all to tell her what to do,” the Hall Master said coldly.

Instantly, everyone kept their mouth shut in fear that their last savior would leave out of annoyance.

At this instant, Luo Qufeng, who continuously sucked the cultivation base of others, was hit with a rush of pleasure after feeling the powers that he absorbed. His eyes were red, and his desire to gain even stronger powers grew.

Luo Qufeng’s eyes landed on Ye Qingtang once again, and his bloodshot eyes resembled that of a vicious wolf.
