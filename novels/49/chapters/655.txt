However, Ye Qingtang could not understand something: even if the Dimension Wall disappeared, why would cultivators from the outside world come to this back to this mainland to incite trouble for no reason?

“What I know is that before that extraordinary lady died, she used her last trace of energy and turned it into a Dimension Wall… That so-called Dimension Wall was to prevent powerful figures from the outside world to intrude and plunder… Hence, I guessed that you attracted everyone into the mystic realm to use their blood to resurrect this Ice Frost Divine Sword and use its power to destroy the Dimension Wall. Am I right?” Ye Qingtang probed.

The black-robed person remained silent for a moment after listening to Ye Qingtang. He finally smiled in reply. “Ye Qingtang, you’re really very smart. You formed a rather complete clue just from a few messy pieces of information…. You’re right. Attracting those cultivators into the mystic realm was merely to use their blood to resurrect the Ice Frost Divine Sword. Once it is resurrected, it can easily destroy the Dimension Wall. By then, powerful figures would come and completely destroy this mainland.”

“Innocent.” Ye Qingtang laughed coldly. “This mainland’s martial culture is backward, and more so, one’s skills would be restricted to the Yin Yang Perfected Lord state when they come here no matter how powerful they are because of the thin spirit energy. Since that’s the case, why would powerful figures take such a risk to come and destroy this mainland?”

If Ye Qingtang was a powerful figure from the outside world, she would definitely not head to a mainland with thin spirit energy and a backward martial culture.

“Ye Qingtang… it’s you who are too innocent.” the black-robed person said. “That lady’s body possessed a special bloodline, and her Spiritual Abode is extremely precious. The lady’s identity was the daughter of an ancient clan’s clan master in the Central Mainland. The special bloodline of that lady bred greed in the hearts of those clan members, resulting in a rebellion. They killed the lady’s parents and wanted to obtain that lady’s divine weapon… Afterward, although the lady fled away from the Central Mainland, those ancient clan rebels still searched for her in the surroundings and have not given up even now. If the Dimension Wall is broken and those rebels feel the aura of the lady’s Spiritual Abode, do you think those ancient clan rebels would let off this mainland which was transformed by the lady’s Spiritual Abode?”

Ye Qingtang was stunned after hearing the black-robed person speak.

If it was really as the black-robed person had said, the rebels from the extraordinary lady’s clan in the Central Mainland would definitely come to destroy this mainland and claim the extraordinary lady’s Spiritual Abode…

“You… truly calculated this well.” Ye Qingtang’s eyes were cold.

“Thus, the fate of this mainland has already been decided.” The black-robbed person replied.

“That may not be so.” Ye Qingtang shook her head. “If the Ice Frost Divine Sword is unable to resurrect or if… the Ice Frost Divine Sword is not in your hands, you will not be able to destroy the Dimension Wall.”

The black-robed person was taken aback for an instant after hearing Ye Qingtang and instinctively turned around to look at the Ice Frost Divine Sword behind him.

However, the Ice Frost Divine Sword had already disappeared from its original location. All he saw was that the Fiendcelestial Beast had held the Ice Frost Divine Sword in its mouth from some time ago.

“How dare you!”

After noticing the situation, the black-robed person was enraged and chased after the little white tiger immediately.

Swoosh!

At the same time, a blood-colored sword aura slashed out and forced the black-robed person, who was cornering the little white tiger, to retreat.

In the next second, the little white tiger strutted to Ye Qingtang’s side with the Ice Frost Divine Sword in its mouth and threw it near her feet.
