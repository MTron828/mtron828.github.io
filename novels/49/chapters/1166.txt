Chapter 1167: The Light of Hope (4)

In this world, the number of cultivators corresponded to the number of powerful figures with attainments. However, how many people could advance to Yin Yang Perfected Lord Ninth Heaven and even Tenth Heaven?

These were known as the legendary realms as almost no one could enter it.

If Ye Qingtang could advance to Yin Yang Perfected Lord Tenth Heaven with the injection of spirit energy, the You Ancient Clan would not be a threat at all. However…

At this instant, the spirit energy in the air condensed once again and enveloped Daoist Zijin in no time.

Under everyone’s nervous watch, Daoist Zijin paled and shouted to stop after ten breaths.

“Peak of Yang Lord Seventh Heaven…”

Daoist Zijin’s eyes were filled with disbelief and excitement when he inspected his realm.

Everyone there had never thought that they could hope to become a Yang Lord in their lives…

“Thank you, Eldest Young Lady… Thank you so much!”

Daoist Zijin walked to Ye Qingtang and bowed.

Ye Qingtang, however, was very clear that she was not the one who allowed Daoist Zijin to advance but Little You Yun. However, in consideration of Little You Yun’s safety, she could not be seen; thus, Ye Qingtang could only represent Little You Yun to accept their thanks.

With Daoist Zijin’s success in the lead, the others were filled with anticipation and were eager to try. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Without wasting time, Ye Qingtang continued to let Little You Yun control spirit energy in the dark and inject spirit energy into others.

Under the continuous injection of spirit energy, eight out of the twelve Peak Masters had advanced to the Yang Lord realm.

As for the remaining four people, their bodies could no longer bear any further injection of spirit energy and only managed to break through to the peak of Yin Yang Perfected Lord Sixth Heaven.

Despite so, those four Peak Masters were satisfied as well. If they could survive in this war, they should be able to reach the Yang Lord realm if they cultivated for the rest of their lives.

Time ticked by, and more and more people’s skills were raised.

In the evening, Perfected Xuanchen walked out from the small pavilion and whispered in Ye Qingtang’s ears. “Little You Yun is tired and cannot continue to control the spirit energy.”

Ye Qingtang nodded slightly. Little You Yun was already doing sufficiently well, and there was no need to hurry to finish in one day now that they had completely grasped this method.

Ye Qingtang turned to look at the remaining people who had not received the injection of spirit energy and said, “I am tired from controlling the Dharma treasure. I’ll continue after a day of rest.”

“You’ve worked hard, Eldest Young Lady!”

A few Si Family Yin Yang Perfected Lord figures immediately thanked Ye Qingtang with cupped fists.

After everyone left, the Blood Moon Elder looked at Ye Qingtang with an odd expression. “Holy Lady… when did you obtain a Dharma treasure that can control spirit energy? Why do I not know?”

The Blood Moon Elder had been following Ye Qingtang but was unaware that Ye Qingtang owned such a Dharma treasure. He had already found it strange when he heard Ye Qingtang saying this, but he was not a fool. Since Ye Qingtang said this publicly, he naturally could not ask her in front of everyone.

Seeing that everyone had left, Ye Qingtang was candid and explained the situation to the Blood Moon Elder.

A light broke in upon the Blood Moon Elder.

Yet, exactly because of this, the Blood Moon Elder was somehow rather moved by Ye Qingtang’s decision to tell him about everything.
