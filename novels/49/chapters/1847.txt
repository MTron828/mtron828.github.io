They rushed towards the area with lights.

It was late at night and a town appeared before them. There weren’t any walls and a series of lights were hung upon the enormous trees, lighting up the entire place.

They could hear the sound of crowds before they even entered the area. The town was bustling with activity, with many gathering around the tree.

They didn’t dare get closer. All they did was to find a huge tree, hiding behind it as they observed the scene.

They were stunned when they saw the figures.

“What is that? Catfish?!” Jiang Shaobai’s eyes widened in shock as he saw their round bodies.

There wasn’t a single human-like figure in the town.

All they saw were round bodies with big mouths, seemingly catfish, with two whiskers. These beings had big stomachs, walking around with their short legs.

“Is that... a catfish demon? I have never seen this species before.” Jiang Shaobai was filled with confusion. The Central Mainland had many unique races, but he hadn’t seen such a species before.

Ye Qingtang’s gaze riveted on Little White Tiger.

Little White Tiger instantly shook its head.

Although it had a broad range of knowledge,...there were countless unique races all over the world. It couldn’t possibly recognize each and every one.

Well, at least Little White Tiger was certain that this being couldn’t be found in the Central Mainland, not to say the First Domain. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

They were really curious about what species it was.

Suddenly, a huge bump appeared on the ground and the next moment, a weird creature resembling a catfish suddenly popped out of it. When it stood up, it shook the soil on its body away.

They were all shocked. They didn’t feel any unfamiliar aura at all.

Their bodies tensed in preparation for action, but the fat catfish didn’t even bother with them. It just walked towards the crowded town.

It didn’t seem to have any intentions of attacking them at all.

They looked at it and took a step forward.

“Please hold on!” Mu Feiruo called out the fat catfish.

The fat catfish stopped. It didn’t even have a neck and could only wobble over. The moment it turned around, it looked at Mu Feiruo with black, beady eyes.

“May I know... where is this?” Ye Qingtang asked.

The fat catfish sized them up, realizing that they weren’t the same kind of being. It remained calm, not showing any aggressive intentions at all.

“You’re new here?”

“...” They nodded.

“You want to know the rules here?” The fat catfish rubbed its palms together and touched its rotund chin.

“Sorry to trouble you,” Ye Qingtang said politely. This fat catfish was far more polite compared to the creatures in the cursed mystic realm.

Except for the fact that it was kind of ugly.

The fat catfish opened up its mouth, showing a mouthful of sharp teeth as it said, “Let’s have a bet. If you win, I’ll tell you everything.

“...”

What?!

They were caught at a loss. A bet?

What was going on? This catfish even knew how to bet?
