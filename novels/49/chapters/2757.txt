Chapter 2758: Epilogue (1)

…

Upper Realm, Heavenly Palace.

“Ye Qingtang, when are you going to give me the position?”

The big yellow dog wagged its tail as it stared at Ye Qingtang.

“Just wait.” Ye Qingtang glanced at the yellow dog.

“Are you done? Even if she gives it to you, you won’t be able to hold onto it. Your pitiful Heavenly Dao energy is not even enough to fill the gaps between my teeth.” The white tiger said to the yellow dog.

“My Heavenly Dao energy was snatched away by Shi Tian. But never mind, I can slowly cultivate… there’s no rush. However, Ye Qingtang, you have to promise me… you will give me the position of Tian the moment you don’t want it. Apart from me, no one else has the right to inherit the position of Tian,” the big yellow dog insisted.

Ye Qingtang could not help sighing. “Continue waiting. It’s only been a thousand years. Even if you cultivate, it will probably take a billion years for you to accumulate enough Heavenly Dao energy.”

“Mother!”

Before long, a young boy about seven or eight years old rushed into the palace and reached out his hands, burrowing into Ye Qingtang’s arms.

“Tian.”

...

Di Jiuyuan and the others entered the Heavenly Palace.

Ye Qingtang pinched the boy’s face dotingly and placed him aside. She looked at Di Jiuyuan. “Mother.”

“Tian, the reconstruction of the upper realm has basically been completed. Things will be easier for us in the near future,” Di Jiuyuan said with a smile.

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang nodded slightly and looked at Ling Yan. “I haven’t left the palace for a thousand years. I plan to take a look in the lower realm.”

“Do you need me to accompany you?” Ling Yan smiled.

“No need. Take good care of our son and daughter at home. Don’t let them create trouble in the upper realm again.” Ye Qingtang sighed.

“Mother, look!”

As soon as Ye Qingtang finished speaking, a red glow appeared in the boy’s palm.

“This is…”

Ling Yan was slightly surprised. “Heavenly Dao Karma Bloodline.”

“Mother, Father… Sister wiped out two Immortal Buddha Divine Sects in the upper realm today. Am I stronger than Sister now?!” The boy’s face was filled with excitement.

“Wiped out two Immortal Buddha Sects…”

Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched.

One of the Immortal Buddha Divine Sects was established by the Nine Heavens Saint a thousand years ago in the upper realm. It was a source of pride to many disciples of the major factions to be able to enter this sect to cultivate. As for the other divine sect, it was established by the Devil Cloud Sect Paragon…

“You two brats, if not for your mother being Tian, those divine sect disciples would have already beaten you to death.” Ye Ling strode into the Heavenly Palace carrying a sweet-looking young girl.

“Dad…” Ye Qingtang looked at Ye Ling.

“Your precious daughter is causing trouble in the divine sects. The Devil Cloud Sect Paragon just made a complaint so I went over to bring her back. Before she learns her lesson, these two troublemakers are not allowed out of the palace.” Ye Ling’s face darkened. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Sigh. Brother Ye Ling, they are just children,” one of the Dragon Emperor Clan’s Perfected Immortals said with a smile.

Ye Ling sighed. “I really can’t handle these two troublemakers. How much trouble have they caused in the upper realm these two months…”

Ye Qingtang glanced at Ling Yan. “See? You have spoiled the children.”

Ling Yan was slightly taken aback and looked confused. “Why would you say that? From the beginning to the end, I only doted on you. Spoiling them is just a side effect.”

Ye Qingtang, “…”

“Mother, it has nothing to do with me. It’s all Sister’s fault!” The boy’s face was slightly red.

“Mother, Father… it’s all Brother’s fault. Brother brought me there. He watched from the side and told me to show off my power…” The young girl looked aggrieved.
