Chapter 2717: Becoming An Immortal Immediately (2)

In a sense, the Fourth Domain could be considered a mini upper realm. In ancient times, the peak experts of the lower realms would not trigger the Heavenly Tribulation when they cultivated to a certain level. Instead, they would qualify to ascend to the Fourth Domain.

In other words, every living being in the Fourth Domain could be considered an immortal being. The Silver Star Holy Lord, High Monk, Heaven Ascension Sect Master and Dark North Divine Buddha were the cream of the crop among them. They were the overlords of the Fourth Domain.

Ye Qingtang did not believe in Immortal Buddhas back then. But now that she witnessed so much, she had no choice but to believe it.

In Ye Qingtang’s era, Immortal Buddhas were just myths and legends. The real existences were True Gods and Heavenly Demons.

True Gods and Heavenly Demons were two completely different races. True Gods created humans, while Heavenly Demons created demons. As for the so-called Perfected Immortals, they were people who ascended to become immortals and supreme beings after cultivating to a certain level.

However, it was impossible to tell who was stronger. A True God or a Perfected Immortal.

“I wonder what the Immortal Buddha bloodline in my body has to do with the Fourth Domain…” Ye Qingtang pondered.

The divine bloodline in Ye Qingtang’s body must be somewhat related to the legends in this world.

It was similar to when Ye Qingtang had broken through to the Yin Yang Perfected Lord Tenth Heaven level and sensed the True God bloodline.

After that, she received the Immortal Buddha bloodline, the Divine Phoenix bloodline and the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline.

The True God bloodline was linked to the True God race, while the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline was related to the Heavenly Demon race. So that meant the Immortal Buddha bloodline should be linked to the Fourth Domain…

“Junior Sister Ye Yue…”

Just as Ye Qingtang was deep in thought, Xie Jun called her name with a smile.

Composing herself, Ye Qingtang looked at Xie Jun. “Senior Brother Xie Jun, what’s the matter?”

“Junior Sister Ye Yue, can you lend me some cursed points? I have a special liking for that Purgatory Demon King.” Xie Jun asked with a smile.

Ye Qingtang looked at the shopkeeper and asked, “What’s the price for the Purgatory Demon King?”

“5,000 cursed points,” the shopkeeper answered.

“Alright.” Ye Qingtang nodded. “I’ll buy it for him.”

After deducting the corresponding points, the skeleton waved and the Purgatory Demon King in front of him turned into a black light and was sealed onto Xie Jun’s arm.

“No spirit pets purchased in the ancient city are allowed to be used here. After buying a spirit animal, you will enter an automatic contract which cannot be changed,” the skeleton said. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Lan Shan hurriedly asked, “Why can’t we use them?”

“The spirit animals from high-tier ancient cities are too powerful. They cannot be used here,” the skeleton explained.

“Apart from spirit animals, are there any other restrictions? For example, Destruction-level divine weapons…” Zhang Chi asked.

“Only spirit animals are restricted,” the skeleton said.

“Then I’ll save my cursed points for something else…” Lan Shan said after some thought.

“Indeed. Although these spirit animals are good, they cannot be used here. So I don’t think they are worth it.”

After leaving the spirit animal shop, Ye Qingtang and the rest headed to the weapons shop in this high-tier ancient city.

The weapons shop in a high-tier ancient city sold only Destruction-level divine weapons.
