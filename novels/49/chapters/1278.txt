Chapter 1279: Shock (2)

Ming Gu had no intention of paying any attention to him. A smelly grub like that was not worth talking to.

Long Yang’s legs started to shake when he saw Ming Gu walk towards him. “How dare you! This is the Long Family’s territory. I don’t care who you are, but if you dare to offend the Long Family, we will ensure that you die a terrible death in the future.”

“Long Family?” Ming Gu cocked his head with a meditative look on his face. He had not left the Temple of Shadows for thousands of years. He had not even heard of the Long Family.

Lady Ghost, who was standing behind Ye Qingtang, smiled and said, “Holy Son Ming Gu, the Long Family is one of the great families in Central Mainland.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Great family? What’s that? Is it something like the Ancient You Clan?” Ming Gu asked somewhat impatiently.

Long Yang’s expression stiffened at Ming Gu’s words.

The Ancient You Clan…

That was the supreme great family in Central Mainland!

Lady Ghost laughed and shook her head.

“Then is it like the Jiang Family?” Ming Gu asked again.

Long Yang was ashen.

Jiang Family?

Wasn’t that the Domain Master…

This small Undead mentioned the top great families in Central Mainland the moment he spoke. Although the Long Family was powerful, they were not in the same class as these two great families.

Just a branch from these two great families could easily crush the Long Family.

Who was this small Undead?

The more Long Yang heard, the more frightened he felt.

Lady Ghost knew that Ming Gu’s knowledge of great families was limited to the Ancient You Clan and the Jiang Family, so she said, “Holy Son Ming Gu, the Long Family… um… how shall I put it? If the Ancient You Clan and the Jiang Family are like this tree.”

Lady Ghost pointed to a towering tree nearby and then pointed to an ant climbing among the debris.

“Then that would be the Long Family.”

“So they really are smelly grubs,” Ming Gu said with a frown.

When Long Yang heard the conversation between Lady Ghost and Ming Gu, he felt a chill creeping towards his scalp.

He had not expected the powerful Long Family to be no more than a smelly grub to these Undead?!

“Young… Young Master… they… they are… Undead from the Temple of Shadows…” A middle-aged man who was behind Long Yang blanched when he heard the conversation between Lady Ghost and Ming Gu.

“What did you say?” Long Yang looked shocked.

The middle-aged man gulped and said, “Just now… just now that female Undead called the small Undead… Ming… Holy Son Ming Gu… He is the Holy Son from the Temple of Shadows…”

Although the Temple of Shadows declined for many years, rumors of it continued to circulate in this mainland. This middle-aged man had heard legends about the Temple of Shadows, and among them had been the name of the Holy Son, Ming Gu.

“Did… did you hear wrongly? Temple of Shadows? Holy Son?!!” Long Yang frantically looked at the middle-aged man. At that moment, he was as pale as a piece of paper.

The Temple of Shadows was so powerful…

It was the supreme Temple that had previously dominated the entire mainland!

Although it had declined for thousands of years, their Long Family was not comparable to them in terms of heritage.

“I… I can’t be certain…” The middle-aged man also panicked. If they had really encountered the Holy Son from the Temple of Shadows, they were all doomed.

“But I certainly heard them address him in that way. Also… in legends, Ming Gu’s physique is like that of a child. I think… there is no mistake.”
