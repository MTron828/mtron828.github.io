Lu Yuanxiang’s eyes darted around. Ye Qingtang was right. This demon really identified them based on their scent and treated them as demons…

However, which tribe should they belong to??

Lu Yuanxiang and the others didn’t know that the demons were divided into tribes.

In a moment of desperation, Lu Yuanxiang blurted out, “I’m from the Netherworld Tribe…”

“Yes, yes. They are from the Netherworld Tribe, but we are different. We are from the Flying Star Tribe. What about you? Which tribe are you from?” asked the Flying Star Academy teacher in a hurry.

“I’m from the West Sea Tribe…” The demon suddenly paused and looked at Lu Yuanxiang and the Flying Star Academy teacher in confusion.

Netherworld Tribe?

Flying Star Tribe?

What kind of tribes were these? He had never heard of them before. Besides, were there really such tribes?

“Netherworld Tribe and Flying Star Tribe? I’ve never heard of you. Who exactly are you?” asked the demon.

“Oh, it’s normal that you don’t know. The Flying Star Tribe and Netherworld Tribe have always stood apart from the affairs of others, and we’ve only been established for a short time.” The Flying Star Academy teacher smiled.

Before the Flying Star Academy teacher could say anything, the demon suddenly looked at Mu Ziying, Qin Feng, and the others. “Why are there humans?”

Qin Feng, Mu Ziying, and the others hadn’t had the chance to apply the demon blood all over their bodies, so they still had the scent of a human.

“Why are there humans here!” The demon’s eyes flashed with desire as he sized up Mu Ziying and the others, as if he was looking at some rare treasure.

“Ah, what… humans?!” The Flying Star Academy teacher was stunned. Then, he turned to look at Mu Ziying and Qin Feng.

“Haha, you are mistaken. There are no humans. As the saying goes, what you think about in the day is reflected in your dreams at night. You must have such a strong desire for humans that you are hallucinating.” As he spoke, the Flying Star Academy teacher secretly touched a handful of demon blood and smeared it on Mu Ziying and Qin Feng’s faces.

From the looks of it, this demon did not seem to be very smart… perhaps he could fool it.

“What are you doing?” The demon stared at the teacher.

“Nothing. Their faces are dirty. Let me wipe them. You don’t know, but they are my children. I love them very much.” The Flying Star Academy teacher smiled.

“They are your children? You said that you are from the Flying Star Tribe, and they are from the Netherworld Tribe. How can they be your children?” the demon said coldly.

“Sigh…” The Flying Star Academy teacher sighed and shook his head.” You don’t know this… although I’m from the Flying Star Tribe, my partner is a demon from the Netherworld Tribe. We are separated… my children went with their mother. I finally got to see them again after much difficulty.”

Ye Qingtang, “…”

Lu Yuanxiang, “…”

Qin Feng, “??”

Mu Ziying, “???”

“Oh, I see. Alright, I won’t disturb you then.” The demon seemed to be deep in thought. It nodded and turned to leave.

Hearing that, the Flying Star Academy teacher smiled. See, he knew that this demon was not smart. It was just a simple fool. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Just when the Flying Star Academy teacher thought that he had succeeded, Ye Qingtang moved swiftly.

Leaping forward, Ye Qingtang blocked the demon’s path.

“Want to leave? Not that easy..” Ye Qingtang’s eyes flickered coldly.
