Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

When Ye Qingtang returned to her room, Lin Long and Su Wan were both present. Lin Long was reading at her table alone as usual while Su Wan, for the first time, initiated to talk to Ye Qingtang when she saw her.

“Ye Qingtang, a senior brother came to find you just now and wants me to tell you to gather outside the sect tomorrow morning. He even prepared a few bottles of elixirs which I placed on your table.” This was the first time Su Wan spoke to Ye Qingtang. Despite acting casual, there was still a hint of awkwardness in her tone.

Ye Qingtang looked at the few bottles of elixirs on her table and immediately knew which senior brother Su Wan was referring to.

“Thanks,” Ye Qingtang said quietly.

Su Wan frowned, and she pursed her lips. It was already a huge grievance for her to interact with Ye Qingtang, but… once she thought of what Liu Yue said before she left, Su Wan still took a deep breath and asked again.

“Are you going to do a mission already?”

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang was keeping the elixirs and did not pay too much attention to Su Wan’s expression.

“But aren’t the new disciples temporarily not appointed any missions?” Su Wan asked in an attempt to fish for more information.

“It is a rewarded mission,” Ye Qingtang replied.

Su Wan was taken aback.

She only heard the outer sect elder mention the rewarded missions when she entered the outer sect. Although some new disciples checked out the Rewards Pavilion these few days, none of them rushed to accept a mission. After all, they were still new disciples and did not have enough control for these missions.

Previously, Su Wan already thought it was strange and thought that Ye Qingtang was appointed on a mission and had to go on a mission together with Qin Huan. Yet…

The mission that Ye Qingtang was going for was actually a rewarded mission!

How could this be?

Su Wan looked at Ye Qingtang’s back view and narrowed her eyes.

Ye Qingtang was only a new disciple and had a red spirit root. Which senior brother or senior sister would bring such a burden on a rewarded mission?

Su Wan really could not understand, but when she saw the sunlight from her window casting on Ye Qingtang’s beautiful side-profile, it was as though she knew something.

No matter how she looked down on Ye Qingtang, Su Wan could not deny that Ye Qingtang’s beauty was indeed outstanding.

“How many days are you going for?” Su Wan asked instinctively but forgot about the urgency in her tone.

Ye Qingtang did not pay much attention previously; thus, she replied one after another, but she suddenly sensed that Su Wan seemed to be very concerned about her mission. She could not help but stop what she was doing and turn to look at Su Wan behind her.

The pair of questioning eyes fell on Su Wan’s soft face, causing Su Wan to panic. Only then did Su Wan realize that she was overly pushy as she was not supposed to probe on just now. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Su Wan, you seem to be very concerned about me going on a mission?” Ye Qingtang raised her eyebrows slightly. It must be known that in all these days that they entered the sect, this young lady Su could not even be bothered to say anything to her. Why did she suddenly change today?

Su Wan paled and looked down, hiding away the panic in her eyes. She put on a calm front and said, “I’m just asking casually.”

Ye Qingtang smiled and did not say anything more, as she really did not feel like playing company with those girly thoughts that Su Wan was having.

As long as Su Wan did not provoke her, she could not be bothered with what Su Wan was thinking of.

Su Wan sat aside silently as hope arose within her.

Ye Qingtang was really going out on a mission. Then, in the coming period of time, Ye Qingtang would never appear beside Senior Brother Yun. She must really seize this opportunity and let Senior Brother Yun know who was actually the best!
