Within half a day, Ye Qingtang leveled up by another heaven. Now, she was at the Second Heaven of the Arcane Supremacy.

Though the speed of cultivation here was no way near that in the nine-star constellation, at least it was safe here.

After all…

Ye Qingtang might not even have time to run away in the world of the nine-star constellation. She did not even imagine trying to cultivate there peacefully.

As Ye Qingtang leveled up, a red light dispersed from her body, filled the whole house, and dashed into the sky.

As General Qiao was worried about how he should handle Dongfang Qing’s death, he suddenly noticed that all the servants had gathered outside Ye Qingtang’s room and kowtowed towards the house in fear and respect.

General Qiao was confused, but when he saw the red light surrounding the room, he was totally shocked.

Red light from the sky?

He only heard about such a phenomenon from legends.

According to the legends, that would only occur when an immortal came to the earth!

An immortal came to the earth…

General Qiao suddenly recalled how his daughter suddenly gained great power and abilities, and he felt dazed.

Was it possible…

That an immortal assisted his daughter?

The red light was getting brighter, and the citizens who were around the General’s residence also noticed it. They were all amazed and thought that an immortal appeared. Within a short period of time, many citizens brought tributes and kneeled outside the General’s residence.

Ye Qingtang did not know anything that happened outside as she restored her aura from leveling up.

In Ye Qingtang’s original world, everyone was used to phenomenons that occurred from spirit energy when someone leveled up. People might just pay attention to that, but no one would treat it as the appearance of an immortal.

If Ye Qingtang knew how people in this world came out with such a ridiculous belief from her leveling up, she might just vomit blood.

The red light disappeared after a while. People outside kowtowed for a while more and dispersed in respect.

The appearance of an immortal was spread among the city.

General Qiao was curious and excited at the same time. However, before he could ask Ye Qingtang about that, some trouble came.

The Emperor was enraged by Dongfang Qing’s death, as General Qiao had expected.

The Dongfang Family just reported how Ye Qingtang killed Dongfang Qing to the Emperor. Even the General’s wife’s eldest daughter Su Mo’er, who forcefully took Su Qiao’s fiance, also joined her father-in-law to report the case to the court.

The Emperor waited for an immortal elixir from Dongfang Qing all the time so that he could be immortal. However, the only person who could refine the elixirs for him was now dead…

The Emperor asked his people to bring the culprit Ye Qingtang to the palace immediately out of rage.

General Qiao was shocked when he knew about that, but he really wanted to protect Ye Qingtang.

“Qiao’er, I’ll bring you to apologize to the Emperor. Trust me, you will be safe even if I have to abandon my position.” After witnessing Ye Qingtang’s power and the red light phenomenon, General Qiao was determined that he must protect his extraordinary daughter.

Ye Qingtang’s expression was odd after hearing General Qiao’s swear.

After Ye Qingtang leveled up, the God of Nature told her that she had completed her mission.
