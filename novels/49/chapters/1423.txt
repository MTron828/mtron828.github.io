1424 Misunderstanding 2

Even trampling over the Second Domain and dominating the Third Domain were probably imminent.

Elder Xu never would have thought that the little girl whom he almost killed actually possessed the rare Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline.

Looking at the worried Elder Xu, Ye Qingtang sighed secretly and used her brain immediately.

The Jiang Family cared most about their bloodlines and descendants. Otherwise, they would not have gone the distance to the First Mainland to bring Ye You back. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Now…

She was also mistaken as an abandoned descendant of the Jiang Family.

A thought struck Ye Qingtang immediately, but she kept a cautious expression. “Isn’t Ye You the clearest about who I am?”

“Ye You?” Elder Xu frowned slightly. He knew that Ye You disliked Ye Qingtang strongly, which was why he went after her life, but he did not ask her about the reason. After all, to him, anyone other than the members of the Jiang Family could be killed freely.

“In the First Mainland, Ye You and I were from the same family clan. Although I was adopted by my father, I also grew up in the Ye Family with Ye You. I did not think that Ye You hated me so much that she would still be thinking of killing me now that we are in the Central Mainland.” Ye Qingtang put on a dejected look and snickered.

“Since you’re from Ye You’s side, just kill me if you want. Why are you still asking me so much? I’m an orphan anyway. If not for my foster father, I would not have lived till now.”

Ye Qingtang said with a decisive expression, but what she said was sufficiently misleading.

First, she pointed out the grudge between her and Ye You, and second, she stated that her parentage was a mystery as she was adopted by the Ye Family.

Thus, she did not know who her parents were.

Yet, Elder Xu was regretful to hear what she said.

“Child, you’re not an orphan. You’re a child of the Jiang Family, and the Heavenly Demon Bloodline in you is the best evidence.” Elder Xu was filled with sympathy and regret as he looked at the battered Ye Qingtang.

If not for that young ape’s protection earlier on, he would have almost killed this Jiang Family descendant and extinguished their hope of regaining a talent that possessed the variant of the Heavenly Demon Bloodline…

“I’m a child of the Jiang Family?” Ye Qingtang had a look of disbelief.

“Of course. Apart from the Jiang Family, who else would possess the Heavenly Demon Bloodline?” Elder Xu said compassionately.

Why wouldn’t there be?

Didn’t she seize one?

Ye Qingtang giggled on the inside but put on a conflicted expression.

“Don’t lie to me. I know that you are with Ye You.”

Elder Xu sighed softly. “Why would I lie to you? Given my skills, killing you is child’s play. Don’t worry. I have verified your identity now and definitely will not do anything to harm you. Quickly consume these elixirs, and I will bring you back to the Jiang Family. Once you are back in the Jiang Family, no one in the Central Mainland can harm you anymore.”

“What you… said is all real? You… really will not kill me?” Even though Ye Qingtang was having trouble stifling her laughter, she continued to put on an insecure expression, which resembled that of a little bunny.

Ye Qingtang, who had exceptional looks to begin with, was now injured and pale. On top of that, this expression made her appear even more pitiful, and Elder Xu felt extremely sorry.

Why did he attack so harshly just now?

Look how scared this child is now.

Elder Xu tried his best to put on a kind look and said gently, “It’s all true.”

It was only then that Ye Qingtang consumed those elixirs doubtfully. The Jiang Family was indeed the Domain Monarch. All of these elixirs were supreme-grade, and any one of them could probably be sold at an exorbitant price.
