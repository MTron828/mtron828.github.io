Chapter 1176: Heaven City (4)

“I have an idea… but…” a young man said.

“What idea is it? Do tell us.”

“We do not have a rations team and are trapped by the You Ancient Clan. The stored supplies in the city are already insufficient, and if this goes on, the citizens and even we will eventually run out of supplies… Instead of that, why not we take care of ourselves first? If the stored food and water in the city are not distributed to others, it is enough for our use… By then, since the You Ancient Clan likes to besiege the city, just let them be then. We will not die from hunger or thirst anyway,” the young man said.

Everyone was taken aback by what that young man said.

“I think it’s feasible.” Gu Yu nodded his head; he had this thought a long time ago.

“No!” That injured Yang Lord elderly resisted with a frown. “What is this! Those archers and the cultivators we recruited to counter the You Ancient Clan are all from Heaven City. Their families and loved ones are all in the city. Are we abandoning millions of lives just to exchange for peace of mind on our food supplies?”

“This is in consideration of the overall situation. If we cannot ensure sufficient food supply, the South battlefield will fall once again.” Gu Yu defended.

“Miss Ye, what do you think?” Gu Yu looked at Ye Qingtang. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Ye Qingtang spoke after remaining silent for a while. “I think that the root problem is not the food supplies but the difference in combat capabilities. Even if we leave the remaining resources in Heaven City for ourselves, it is also futile.”

To solve the root problem, they had to strike Dragon Elephant City.

Currently, the South battlefield was too passive, and should this go on for long, they would not be far from being completely conquered by the You Ancient Clan.

“Everyone, how about this? We will only send one person out today. If you all can win, we will retreat. What do you think?” The You Ancient Clan elderly said with a laugh.

After thinking for a long time, Gu Yu said to that You Ancient Clan elderly, “Do you mean what you say?”

That You Ancient Clan elderly laughed indifferently. “Of course. We, the You Ancient Clan, will not go back on our words.”

“Good! Since you all are so confident, let’s give it a try today!” Gu Yu snickered.

The You Ancient Clan elderly shot a look at a green-robed man beside him.

The green-robed man immediately took a step forward at the drumming of the You Ancient Clan war drums.

“You Tianhe from You Ancient Clan. Who is coming forward to enlighten me?” You Tianhe looked across the masses at the top of the city walls plainly.

The Heavenly City figures looked at each other. You Tianhe was one of the ten young talents of You Ancient Clan, and even the youngest Yang Lord of the ancient clan, Mo Feng, only had a draw with him.

“Humph! Arrogant!” The injured elderly sneered. “Let me meet you!”

Then, the injured elderly was about to leave the city to accept the battle.

“Wait.” Suddenly, Gu Yu walked forward and stopped the injured elderly. “Miss Ye was sent by the headquarters… I wish to let Miss Ye accept this battle and let her familiarize herself with the You Ancient Clan as soon as possible… If Miss Ye is defeated, it’s not too late for you to step in.”

“This…”

The injured elderly looked at Ye Qingtang and said with a frown, “Miss Ye is still too young. Although her martial realm is powerful, she does not have enough foundations. Furthermore, Miss Ye does not know anything about You Tianhe, but we have fought many times. Even if I cannot defeat him, I can still flee back…”

Currently, every Yang Lord in Heaven City was extremely precious, and nothing must go wrong.
