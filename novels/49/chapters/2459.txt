Chapter 2460: Meeting In Another Era (2)

“Ah?” The little azure dragon was completely dumbfounded. The Son of Destiny was their enemy?

“Ling Yan, are you sure?” The little azure dragon’s expression gradually turned solemn.

“I am certain,” Ling Yan confirmed.

“Then, do you know how strong the Son of Destiny is now? If he’s a major foe, we’ll kill him in advance!” A cold glint flashed across the little azure dragon’s eyes.

It had done this kind of thing countless times with Ling Yan. Although it was a little shameless, there was no harm in being shameless again.

Ling Yan smiled. “Naive.”

“What do you mean?” The little azure dragon was somewhat offended.

“Do you know what it means to be a Son of Destiny? He is the chosen one. Even if he’s weak now, an immortal might not be able to kill him. Perhaps even I won’t be able to,” Ling Yan muttered.

“What should we do then?” The little azure dragon was completely bewildered. This was the first time it had heard Ling Yan say that he was powerless.

In this world, Ling Yan seemed omnipotent. He was a master player who used the world as his chessboard and everything in it as his chess pieces. Everyone linked to him was a chess piece in his hands.

However, just now, this same man said that he couldn’t do it…

“This is the calamity of the common people… It has finally begun. The appearance of the Son of Destiny is just the beginning.” Ling Yan shook his head and sighed softly.

“Is there no other way?” The little azure dragon did not doubt Ling Yan’s words at all.

“There is.” Ling Yan nodded slightly.

“What?” The little azure dragon asked hurriedly.

As long as there was a way, everything would be fine. The most terrifying thing was when there were no solutions at all.

“The person who will resolve this calamity… is Miss Ye,” Ling Yan said after a moment of thought.

The little azure dragon was speechless. After going one big circle, it had come back to this again.

“Do you mean that little girl, Ye Qingtang, can settle the one chosen by the heavens?” The little azure dragon asked anxiously.

“Logically speaking, that is the case,” Ling Yan said.

“Alright, let’s go. Let’s find that little girl, Ye Qingtang. If there’s really no other way, I’ll bring her to our tribe. The great Azure Dragon God will impart her some skills and then we’ll kill that Son of Destiny together,” the little azure dragon said.

Ling Yan shook his head. “I’ve calculated earlier that Miss Ye will ultimately die in the hands of the Son of Destiny. No matter what, she won’t be able to overcome this hurdle, unless…”

“Unless what?” The little azure dragon’s eyes turned cold.

“The secrets of the heavens must not be leaked. All you need to know is that I have transacted with that ancient god for the Wheel of Destiny. This might be our only chance,” Ling Yan said.

“How confident are you?”

“Less than 1%.” Ling Yan did not try to hide anything.

The little azure dragon said, “Less than 1%. We might as well wait for death.”

“Just this 1% is enough for me to risk everything.” Ling Yan was deep in thought. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Immediately after, Ling Yan used the Wheel of Destiny given to him by the ancient god to condense all the Spirit of Chaos into a stream of light. In the next second, Ling Yan threw the Wheel of Destiny into the flowing light.

“This is… the Chaos Domain!” Staring at the stream of light in the void, the little azure dragon gasped.

The little azure dragon never expected that the Spirit of Chaos which Ling Yan had painstakingly gathered was actually for the sake of opening the Chaos Realm!

When the world first opened, it was filled with chaos. There was nothing else, only darkness.

If they stepped into the Chaotic Realm, they would reach the peak of chaos. Perhaps, something might happen there, something which even the heavens could not stop..
