Chapter 2479: Chasing Them (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The Flying Star Academy teacher suddenly understood the Yongle Tribe General’s intentions as well. He wanted them to deal with the Xihai Tribe personally.

He was a Great General after all. Even now, he was still being cautious and could not trust them completely.

The Flying Star Academy teacher frowned as a strange look took over his face. They had risked their lives to come to the Yongle Tribe to avoid the Xihai Tribe which was hunting them. And now the Yongle Tribe General wanted to push them out to deal with the Xihai Tribe. What a joke.

Ye Qingtang glanced at the Flying Star Academy teacher. The Yongle Tribe General still had his doubt about them, and not coming forward would only make him more suspicious. But there was no way they would be able to deal with the Xihai Tribe if they were to go out.

She suddenly had a great headache. She didn’t expect to be caught in such a tough position.

At this moment, they could neither stay nor leave.

“Since that’s the case, I will go out and take a look,” she said to the Flying Star Academy teacher after a long while.

In such a situation, the Flying Star Academy teacher couldn’t go himself and had to send someone else in his stead.

Lu Yuanxiang and the others had no other suggestions, so Ye Qingtang had no choice but to take the initiative to attack.

“Many thanks to Ancestor Qing.’ Hearing her words, the Yongle Tribe General quickly cupped his fist at her.

Even though the Flying Star Academy teacher didn’t say anything else, he was extremely worried. What was the use of her going out? Wasn’t she just going to her death?

Even though that was what he was thinking, he didn’t dare say these things out loud. He only narrowed his eyes and maintained a look of calm, as though the Xihai Tribe did not concern him at all.

“Ancestor Qing, I will lead the way.”

The Yongle Tribe General quickly turned his gaze to Ye Qingtang and gestured for her to go.

She could only nod and follow the Yongle Tribe General.

At the top of the mountain, she broke out in a cold sweat as she looked down. The Xihai Tribe had completely surrounded the Yongle Tribe. Even a fly would have trouble getting out.

A huge demon was riding on a mount above in the sky, its cold gaze seeming to pierce through a thousand creatures. Just a single gaze was enough to make someone freeze.

“It’s you!”

The Xihai Tribe General riding on the mount in the sky called out in a booming voice that shook the skies when he saw Ye Qingtang. His voice made her ears ache.

She stared at the Xihai Tribe General without saying a word, her mind thinking of countermeasures.

She could still use the Mirror of Illusions one more time but it was not going to be easy to scare the Xihai Tribe General.

“Xihai Tribe General, how presumptuous of you to not be respecting your ancestor,” the Yongle Tribe General said coldly as he looked at the Xihai Tribe General.

“Ancestor?”

Hearing the Yongle Tribe General’s words, the Xihai Tribe General sneered and said, “Zang, you really are regressing more the longer you live. Stop fantasizing about the return of the Demon Emperor. You’re still dreaming and still haven’t woken up.”

“I won’t argue with you any further. Since you’ve offended the ancestors, it’s the end of the Xihai Tribe,” the Yongle Tribe General said.

The Xihai Tribe General laughed wildly and said, “Alright, I want to see how good your so-called ancestor is, that she can destroy my Xihai Tribe.. Since she killed my son, not only is she to blame, but the entire Yongle Tribe is at fault as well!”
