Chapter 2039: Return (3)

You Qiong sounded extremely tired and weak but Ye Qingtang was relieved to hear his voice.

“What happened to you?” she asked.

A bitter laugh came from the voice transmission stone. “I’m not going to die so easily.”

“What happened that day?” she asked.

You Qiong explained everything that happened that day to her.

On that day, the Clan Master was extremely unhappy with Elder Mo. Even though he had not said it out loud, his attitude made it obvious.

It was no surprise that Elder Mo had been in an even worse mood. The problem with the Crimson League had started from him. Even though they all thought that the Crimson League was merely using that as an excuse, Elder Mo was the one who had given them the opportunity to do so after all.

There was no way he could argue back at them, so he could only vent his anger on You Qiong. Since You Qiong was the one who had informed him of the situation, Elder Mo had beaten him up severely before leaving.

While Elder Mo wasn’t going to kill him, he wasn’t going to let him go as well. He planned to let You Qiong take the fall for all his problems.

Fortunately, he didn’t have to worry for his life until he came back.

“Where are you now? Don’t worry, I will be sure to save you.” Ye Qingtang breathed a sigh of relief after learning that his life wasn’t in danger.

You Qiong was stunned for a moment before saying, “I was brought with them to a certain place. It seems to be at the Winter Canyon in the west region and they seem to be converging with the other forces here. They will be here for another two days...”

The Winter Canyon?

Ye Qingtang frowned slowly.

The Winter Canyon was in a rather remote place and legend stated that great demons were once stationed there. Humans rarely approached the place.

The Ancient You Clan’s power was mostly concentrated in the east. If You Qiong had not informed her of this, she would never have thought that they still had power in the west.

“Alright. Please hang in there. I will be sure to save you,” she said.

There was some commotion on You Qiong’s side and their connection was suddenly cut off.

Since she had just received this critical information, Ye Qingtang prepared to leave soon after. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

...

In the Winter Canyon, the Ancient You Clan troops had set up camp under flickering flames.

You Qiong was locked up in a huge metal cage and looked extremely frail. His entire body was covered in wounds and he seemed to be on his last legs.

Putting away the voice transmission stone carefully, he lay on the cold ground without moving. His gaze trailed silently towards the cage by his side.

The cage was stuffed full of bloody bodies.

They were all demon cubs. Their pelts had all been stripped off and their raw skin was exposed to the cold, cruel air. Just a light touch brought them great pain.

But the cubs whose voices were long hoarse from shouting were already numb to all of this. They were covered in a layer of powder which helped stop their bleeding and allowed them to breathe.

You Qiong had been kept with them these few days and all he smelled was blood mixed in with medicine. He had personally witnessed these cubs being skinned alive before they were thrown into the cells.

Those poor, naive cubs could only stare at their pelts in fear...
