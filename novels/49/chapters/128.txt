Chapter 129: Outer Sect Disciple (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

In her previous life, it was hard for Ye Qingtang to train in the sect. Even if she feigned a spirit root, she still did not have a spirit root in reality. Hence, it was especially difficult for her when she was cultivating in the sect. For a cultivation technique that others would be able to learn in a day or two, she would require over ten times the duration only to be able to barely compete with others.

Precisely because her cultivation was slow, she seemed exceptionally clumsy amongst all the disciples and suffered quite a lot.

But this time…

Everything was different.

The Black Heaven Water that Ye Qingtang required was within the sect’s mystic realm. Ye Qingtang knew of it quite late back then, and that item had already been obtained by an inner sect disciple. This time, she came at just the right time, and she would have to enter the inner sect as soon as possible if she wanted to obtain the Black Heaven Water.

And only by entering the inner sect would she obtain the sect’s highest-level martial techniques.

The outer sect was just a step of hers. She must think of a way to pass the inner sect assessment within a year; otherwise, she would have no fate with the Black Heaven Water! It would be even more difficult for her to recover from the loss of her spirit root and grow her new spirit root!

At the thought of this, Ye Qingtang was very motivated and had a clearer image of what she had to do next.

After a short rest, the newly-entered disciples had to gather outside to listen to allocations.

While Ye Qingtang just started preparing to leave, Su Wan had already left ahead of her.

Obviously, although Su Wan was not welcomed by Lin Long, she did not intend to interact with Ye Qingtang. To this, Ye Qingtang was not bothered at all. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

At the public square in the outer sect, all the newly-entered disciples were gathered.

Ye Qingtang arrived a little later. Upon seeing Ye Qingtang, Yun Shu, who had already changed into Xuanling Sect’s uniform and was standing at the public square, could not help but show a gentle smile.

“Junior Sister Ye, you’re the only one left. Hurry up.”

Ye Qingtang chuckled and stood beside Yun Shu immediately.

The middle-aged man who was in charge of the assessment had left, and the person standing before Ye Qingtang and the rest was an outer sect elder.

Sects are divided into the inner sect and outer sect, with the disciples in the former being in a respectable place that outer sect disciples could not be compared to. Thus, the elders in charge of the outer sect were Xuanling Sect’s second-class elders.

One would not have any fate to meet the real elders from the four factions if they did not enter the inner sect.

The elder standing in front of them was donned in gray, and his both hands were behind his back. He looked over fifty years old and had a strict expression. Looking over the crowd, he frowned slightly when he saw Ye Qingtang, but did not say anything much. He simply said to the group of new disciples,

“After entering Xuanling Sect today, you all are no longer the same as those people outside. You must remember that you are a disciple of Xuanling Sect, and regardless of what you do, the sect’s honor must be placed as a priority. From today onwards, you will enter the outer sect’s Sword Faction to cultivate your swordsmanship. You are to listen to all the arrangements by the sect. If there’s anyone who dares to go against the sect’s rules, the person will be expelled from the sect and never be allowed in ever again.”

Ye Qingtang did not know whether it was real or not, but she kept feeling that the outer sect elder seemed to be looking at her when he mentioned the “sect’s honor.”

She touched the tip of her nose. It seemed that all the elders already knew that she passed the assessment with a red spirit root.

Indeed, in sects where orange spirit roots were already very rare, her only red spirit root was already unusually “eye-catching.”
