1419 The Guilty Party Files The Suit 3

Seeing that Ye You was in danger, Elder Xu immediately withdrew himself and caught both girls in each hand to dodge the lightning strikes.

No one expected this abrupt change of events. Ye Qingtang, who originally prepared to fight to death, was surprised as well.

In the next second, a few figures suddenly descended from the sky and landed right before Elder Xu and the rest.

They were a few middle-aged men with overbearing demeanors. The leader of the group had white hair and stood with his hands behind his back. His sharp gaze completely ignored Ye Qingtang and Beidou Demon Lord and shot right at Elder Xu.

“Ancient You Clan, what is the meaning of this?” Elder Xu frowned slightly as he looked at the people who suddenly appeared to kill them.

These people were members of the Ancient You Clan, and that elderly in the lead was an Elder of Ancient You Clan.

Both the Domain Monarch’s Jiang Family and Ancient You Clan were top forces of the Central Mainland and had never interfered with each other. However, the Ancient You Clan suddenly attacked them today, which displeased Elder Xu immensely.

“What is the meaning of this? The Ancient You Clan should be the one asking the Jiang Family that,” the Ancient You Clan Elder said coldly.

“Ask us?” Elder Xu was perplexed. “The Jiang Family has always minded our own business and coexisted peacefully with the Ancient You Clan for thousands of years. There has been no exception.”

“Stop acting innocent.” A middle-aged man from the Ancient You Clan berated loudly. “Do you all think that we don’t know what your Jiang Family did in the First Mainland? So much for proclaiming to be noble and virtuous when you all are so vicious in the dark. How shameless.”

When the Ancient You Clan headed to the First Mainland to collect the Spiritual Abode, the Jiang Family had already implied that they would not interfere. Yet, the Ancient You Clan never expected to encounter the hindrance from a high-ranking member of the Jiang Family in the First Mainland, and the Ancient You Clan did not forget this score.

“What are you all saying? Why do I not understand?” Elder Xu’s brows were furrowed slightly. They went to the First Mainland for a short while and returned. When had they ever been in conflict with the Ancient You Clan?

“Stop acting innocent in front of us. No matter what you say today, the Ancient You Clan will not believe it. Since the Jiang Family broke the rules, don’t blame the Ancient You Clan for being merciless!” The Ancient You Clan Elder said coldly. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Elder Xu had a grim expression. No matter how he thought about it, he could not understand when they opposed the Ancient You Clan.

“Elder Xu, I think that this Ancient You Clan is clearly finding an excuse to eliminate our Jiang Family.” Ye Xun whispered with a frown.

Elder Xu’s expression changed subtly.

The skills of the Ancient You Clan and Jiang Family were almost on par before, but if they were to really fight, the Jiang Family would definitely win by a margin.

But after the Ancient You Clan brought the Spiritual Abode back from the First Mainland, their skills increased massively, and their forces expanded rapidly over this period of time as well.

“Aren’t you all afraid to declare war with the Jiang Family?” Elder Xu said coldly.

“Declare war? If there really was a declaration of war, it will be the Jiang Family who declares it!” The Ancient You Clan people snickered. The instant they finished their sentence, the Ancient You Clan Elder immediately led his men and sprinted towards Elder Xu.

Elder Xu’s expression froze, and he attacked immediately. However, he had to take into account Ye You’s safety as well and thus was on high alert constantly.
