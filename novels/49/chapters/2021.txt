Chapter 2022: Phenomenal War (1)

“Ning Luo can sense where the person you’re looking for is. With his help, you will be more successful in your search.” Ling Yan looked at Ye Qingtang with a gentle smile.

“You think that he will help me?” Ye Qingtang wasn’t convinced that Ning Luo would be that nice.

“In helping you, he will be helping himself.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Ye Qingtang instantly understood.

Little You Yun was the reincarnation of the extraordinary lady. She had no idea how little You Yun was doing, but judging from little Luo Xue’s situation, they were probably experiencing the same conditions.

...

“I will help you find her, but that is all that I will do. I have no interest in anything else that’s happening in the Central Mainland.” Ning Luo made himself clear.

Ever since he had opened up the Dimension Wall, Ning Luo had left the First Domain and never turned back. He hadn’t expected his master to reincarnate after many years had passed...

The only reason he had stayed behind in the Central Mainland was because he could feel his master.

As for Ling Yan...

Ling Yan’s expression turned a little strange and Ning Luo could see it with his peripheral vision, but he didn’t say anything about it.

Ye Qingtang looked at Ning Luo’s complicated expression.

“Miss Ye,” Ling Yan said.

“Yes?”

“I have a suggestion.” Ling Yan smiled.

“Tell me what’s on your mind.”

“Just as I said earlier, you’re planning to look for her right when the Crimson League and Ancient You Clan start fighting. However, this is not a good plan,” Ling Yan said.

“What suggestion do you have?” Ye Qingtang looked at Ling Yan.

“Since the Temple of Shadows has returned to the Crimson League, you must join the war. You have a better understanding of the Central Mainland than any others. Why don’t you lead the Crimson League in fighting the Ancient You Clan?” Noticing that Ye Qingtang wasn’t very much against his idea, he continued.

“Ning Luo can sense where she is. If you lead the Crimson League over, I’m sure he can sense it...”

Ling Yan’s words completely enlightened Ye Qingtang.

“Instead of waiting, why don’t you make the move. You can destroy some of Ancient You Clan’s important areas and perhaps sense little You Yun.” Ye Qingtang’s mind was whirring. This was a better idea and the Crimson League wouldn’t suspect a thing.

Ling Yan nodded.

With Ling Yan’s idea and Ning Luo joining them, she had greater hopes of finding little You Yun.

With that, Ye Qingtang went to look for Mi. Mi was the general for the Crimson League this time and had full control over the army.

Ye Qingtang had originally not planned to join them but with this new idea, she claimed that she had a better understanding of the Ancient You Clan’s powers and sought to join them as the commander.

Mi didn’t think much about it and agreed.

Ye Qingtang’s first target was one of the Ancient You Clan’s three most important spots.

The Temple of Shadows was led by Commander Ye Qingtang. Ming Di, Ming Wang, Ming Gu and the eight tribe leaders were also involved. Apart from them, the clans and powers under the Temple of Shadows’ protection also joined the skirmish.

A phenomenal war was about to take place.

An entire army gathered at the plain. It was made up of the Undead Clan, humans as well as demons.

At that moment, the wind howled from the north and everyone’s eyes riveted on the demon dragon in the sky – Ming Di. And above Ming Di was a lithe figure wearing a gold mask that reflected the lights.
