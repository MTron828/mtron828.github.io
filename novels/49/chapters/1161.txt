Chapter 1162: Supplying Spirit Energy (2)

In the next second…

The extremely dense spirit energy in the void above immediately rushed into Falling Sky Valley!

Ye Qingtang and Perfected Xuanchen were shocked to see the dense spirit energy suddenly rush towards them.

But before they understood what was going on.

The dense spirit energy that was pouring down swiftly shrouded Perfected Xuanchen!

The spirit energy that enclosed Perfected Xuanchen suddenly rushed into his body at great speed.

Ye Qingtang, who was watching from the side, saw huge amounts of spirit energy rushing into Perfected Xuanchen’s body. Her eyes widened involuntarily.

As huge amounts of spirit energy rushed in, Perfected Xuanchen’s martial ability increased with unimaginable speed in the span of a few short breaths. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Perfected Xuanchen looked shocked, and his face was filled with disbelief. “I’ve… broken through… how is that possible?!”

He had been at the Third Heaven of Yin Yang Perfected Lord for many years. Many years ago, his martial ability had reached a bottleneck. However, within the span of a few short breaths, he had broken through to the Fifth Heaven of Yin Yang Perfected Lord!

Before Perfected Xuanchen could finish speaking, he looked shocked again.

“Yin Yang Perfected Lord… Sixth Heaven… what is this!”

In an instant, his ability had increased by another level!

Perfected Xuanchen was unable to believe what was happening. It was as if he was in a dream. However, his breakthrough in cultivation level was real.

As Perfected Xuanchen’s cultivation level broke through to the Yang Lord realm of Yin Yang Perfected Lord Seventh Heaven, Ye Qingtang keen senses perceived that Perfected Xuanchen’s face was starting to turn pale, and his entire body began to shudder violently.

“Little You Yun… stop for a while.” Ye Qingtang flew over to little You Yun and spoke hurriedly.

Little You Yun looked at Ye Qingtang in bewilderment but obediently nodded her head and dispersed the spirit energy that surrounded Perfected Xuanchen.

Just as little You Yun dispersed the spirit energy, Perfected Xuanchen stumbled backward for a few meters before he could finally stand firmly. He was completely ashen and covered with large drops of sweat.

“Master, are you alright?” Ye Qingtang looked at Perfected Xuanchen worriedly.

“No big deal, just…” Perfected Xuanchen panted heavily and shook his head. “I’ve reached the limit… of my ability to absorb spirit energy…”

Ye Qingtang only relaxed after hearing Perfected Xuanchen’s words.

It looked like little You Yun could indeed control the spirit energy in this mainland.

Also, little You Yun was entirely capable of sending spirit energy into a cultivator’s body, causing their martial ability to improve greatly in a short span of time.

Because of You Yun’s curse, in this mainland, the highest realm that cultivators could reach was Yin Yang Perfected Lord.

However, breaking through to the Ninth and Tenth Heaven of Yang Lord had nothing to do with spirit energy. Instead, one had to open an “iron door” in one’s dantian. Hence, little You Yun’s use of spirit energy was limited to helping a cultivator break through to the peak of the Eighth Heaven of Yin Yang Perfected Lord.

Also, a cultivator’s tolerance was limited. Not all cultivators could tolerate the impact of the spirit energy that would bring them to the peak of the Eighth Heaven of Yin Yang Perfected Lord within a short span of time.

A cultivator’s body was like a vessel while spirit energy was like water in the vessel. If the rate at which the spirit energy was being supplied could be carefully controlled, then a cultivator could swiftly increase his capabilities within a short span of time.

However, once the supply of spirit energy exceeded the limit of what cultivator’s body could tolerate, the consequences would be dire.
