Chapter 2024: Phenomenal War (3)

After all, the power of the Temple of Shadows was not something they could go against.

“If you fear for your lives, you can all leave now.” A cold laugh suddenly came from within the Ancient Clan’s camp.

Ye Qingtang froze as she heard that and turned to look at the voice. Everyone turned to look as well and was greeted by the sight of a beautiful girl with a cold smile staring at them. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Mo Yi was the one who had spoken up.

She looked at those from the Ancient Clans frostily and sneered, “Ancient Clan? You call yourself an Ancient Clan? You’re just a bunch of death-fearing cowards... Dogs that have lost their homes... Did you forget that you were all scared off by the Ancient You Clan and could only come to hide at the Temple of Shadows? Pathetic. You all don’t have an ounce of courage within you. How dare you call yourselves Ancient Clans?”

“Nicely said.” Jiang Lang looked at his wife with eyes full of love.

“Who here understands how powerful the Ancient You Clan is more than my Jiang family? You can renounce your title as an Ancient Clan and run along to the Ancient You Clan to beg for mercy if you’re so scared. Maybe they’ll show you some mercy.” Jiang Lang looked at the people around him in contempt.

They all turned pale at Jiang Lang and his wife’s words.

But their words made Ye Qingtang laugh lightly.

They were her ‘parents’ alright and represented the spirit of the Ancient Clans.

“Scared? Who isn’t scared? The Jiang family was wiped out by a single person from the Ancient You Clan. The difference in power is too great!” The Baili family Clan Master said with a frown.

“That’s right. Why do we have to tag along and die if the Temple of Shadows is confident in themselves? We’re not a match for the Ancient You Clan.”

Many of them were unwilling to join the fight. They had been brought there by force and constantly wanted to leave the army. With that, the Ancient Clans started discussing among themselves.

Jiang Lang and Mo Yi looked at all of this with cold smiles on their faces. They had long since seen through the facade of the Ancient Clans.

“But we’re still alive.”

A clear, cold voice suddenly rang out.

The Baili Family Elder looked towards the voice and was surprised that it came from someone from his own family clan, Baili Xi...

Beside him was a petite girl. She was pale but her eyes were filled with admiration for Baili Xi.

“I want to live a good life. If we can only live our lives in shame from now on, I would rather die in battle.” Baili Xi looked with resolve at his family clan Elder as he walked with the petite girl towards Ye Qingtang.

“I want to fight for my dignity and formally request to join the Holy Lord’s army.”

Ye Qingtang looked at Baili Xi who had been through thick and thin with her, and a smile flashed across her face.

“So do I.” Another voice rang out and a girl with a cold expression stepped out from the crowd. She walked over to Baili Xi.

“Mu Feiruo?” The Mu Family Clan Master’s face darkened as he saw her speak up. Hadn’t they already discussed in secret to leave the Holy Lord of Shadows’s army?

However...

Who knew that their own family clan members would ruin everything at this crucial moment!

Ye Qingtang felt joy fill her heart as she saw the two familiar faces.

“Feiruo, get back here at once!” the Mu Family Master instructed coldly.

In response, she turned to look coldly at her father.

“Father, you’re planning to trample on the Mu fam1ily’s good reputation that we have upheld for tens of thousands of years?”
