Ye Qingtang’s head hurt a little…

She taught Zhou Qu a lesson just now because there was no one in the Rewards Pavilion at that time and because three moves would only take a short time; thus, it would not be seen by others as she wished. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

In the end…

Someone still ended up seeing it.

Ye Qingtang was not afraid of anything but of someone using this matter to stir up trouble.

After all, it was strictly forbidden for disciples to fight amongst themselves in the sect.

Zhou Qu was still being stepped under her foot, and with a face full of blood, he looked extremely miserable.

If someone saw this and wanted to stir trouble, it would really be a bother.

It was not that Ye Qingtang could not cook up some lies, but it would take some persuasion and be a waste of time.

As Ye Qingtang was conflicted about what to do, the two disciples outside the main door similarly experienced complicated emotions.

As Gu Yanqiu looked at the devilish-looking girl, shock filled him. He initially wanted to submit a mission with his junior brother, but who knew that he would stumble into such an exciting show just when he reached the entrance of the Rewards Pavilion.

Gu Yanqiu recognized the person on the floor as well—the rather “famous” disciple in the outer sect, Zhou Qu.

Gu Yanqiu knew what kind of person Zhou Qu was, but… he did not expect that there would be a day Zhou Qu would be pressed on the floor and be badly beaten up.

What made Gu Yanqiu more shocked was that unfamiliar girl.

“Senior brother, this girl is quite skilled,” Qin Huan, who was standing beside Gu Yanqiu, said as he blinked and looked at Ye Qingtang with approval.

He had been annoyed with Zhou Qu for a long time and would have given him a beating long ago if not for the sect’s rules.

Unexpectedly, someone helped him to vent his anger.

Gu Yanqiu frowned slightly. He noticed that there was a change in emotion in the girl’s eyes and guessed what she might be concerned of. Coughing lightly, he said, “Junior Brother Qin, go submit the mission first.”

Then, he handed the items to Qin Huan.

Qin Huan did not say anything further and took the items over. When he walked past Ye Qingtang, he even cast Ye Qingtang a flirty look as though it was nothing.

“Ye Qingtang…”

This senior brother, your principles are gone.

As she saw Qin Huan climbing the stairs up, the worry in her heart finally faded slowly. It seemed that these two senior brothers were not big-mouthed.

Then, Ye Qingtang was ready to take a leave first and then later decide what to do.

Seeing that Ye Qingtang was about to leave, Gu Yanqiu immediately said, “Junior sister, please hold on.”

Ye Qingtang stopped in her tracks slightly and looked at the good-looking young man confusedly.

“How do I address you, junior sister? I am Gu Yanqiu,” Gu Yanqiu said politely.

Gu Yanqiu?

Ye Qingtang’s eyes widened in surprise. She heard of this name in her previous life as well.

However, when she entered Xuanling Sect’s outer sect in her previous life, Gu Yanqiu had already become an inner sect disciple. She had never met him and only heard some things about him.

Gu Yanqiu was talented, tactful, and thoughtful, and, thus, favored by the Xuanling Sect elders.

After going through a few clues about Gu Yanqiu from her previous life, Ye Qingtang replied, “My name is Ye Qingtang, and I am one of the disciples in the newest batch.”

Gu Yanqiu was surprised. He already found Ye Qingtang unfamiliar previously and never expected that she was actually a new disciple.

He looked at Zhou Qu, who was still lying on the floor, and shock filled Gu Yanqui’s eyes unavoidably.

A newly-entered disciple could actually beat Zhou Qu up into this state?

“Senior Brother Gu, is there anything else?” Ye Qingtang did not intend to stay for long.

Looking away, he cast a look at Ye Qingtang as though he was thinking about something. A moment later, he then said slowly,

“I wonder if Junior Sister Ye is interested in taking up a mission.”
