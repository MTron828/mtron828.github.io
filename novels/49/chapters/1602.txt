Chapter 1603: Kingdom Knights (3)

“Tang, you really know how to enjoy yourself huh? Do you feel safe hiding here?” The blond knight Toby looked mockingly at Ye Qingtang, who was in her room.

“Get out,” Ye Qingtang said expressionlessly. She could ignore their ignorant jabs, but she did not like others invading her personal space.

“Ah... the little lamb has a temper?” Toby laughed coldly. He completely ignored Ye Qingtang’s order.

“Tang, since you are now a Kingdom Knight, shouldn’t you participate in the Kingdom Knights’ training?” Another Kingdom Knight was up to no good.

Ye Qingtang stood up. “Where?”

“What?” Toby and the others evidently did not understand Ye Qingtang’s words.

“Where is the training?” asked Ye Qingtang.

Although Ye Qingtang had been cultivating for the past few days, she had asked the vice-general to petition the King to allow her to join in the battle as soon as possible. However, the King seemed to be ignoring her petition. Ye Qingtang did not know what else to do, so she intended to have a good talk with the King about participating in the battle after she finished cultivating.

But this group of arrogant Kingdom Knights had come knocking again.

The God of Nature had said that she must not casually hurt the citizens of the Supreme League Kingdom, but if she was “sparring” during a training session, it should not be an issue.

For the past few days, they had often sought her out to make trouble. Besides mocking and disparaging her, they had crossed the line by barging into her room today.

Ye Qingtang was good-tempered, but she would not permit them to act like that.

Toby and the others immediately understood Ye Qingtang’s meaning. They exchanged glances and saw scheming looks in each other’s eyes.

Because they were all Kingdom Knights, they could not find any excuse to teach this parasite a lesson. Now, she had stupidly given them an opening. They must allow her to fully experience the power of a Kingdom Knight. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

With that, Toby and the others immediately led Ye Qingtang to the court where the Kingdom Knights usually trained.

Many Kingdom Knights were already training in the court. The sounds of slaughtering and the clash of weapons could be heard continually.

When Ye Qingtang entered the court, the Kingdom Knights who were in the middle of their training simultaneously fixed their gaze on her. Their hands stopped moving.

“Why is she here?” Someone asked with a frown.

Ye Qingtang had been in the fortress for many days, but she could not fight without the King’s orders. This had made them even more disgruntled...

They had never seen Ye Qingtang’s shadow cross the court. She had not trained at all.

“Who knows? Perhaps Toby and the others brought her here.”

“That fellow Toby has brains! I have a bone to pick with this Tang fellow. Does she really think that she’s here in the fortress to enjoy herself like some Lord’s daughter? She doesn’t even come for training. How can someone like her be fit to be a Kingdom Knight?”

“What’s she doing here? Embarrassing herself? Do you think she can even pick up a weapon with her little arms and legs?” A Kingdom Knight coldly glanced at the weapons on display. As Kingdom Knights, they were much stronger than ordinary soldiers. All their weapons were forged by special craftsmen, and just those alone were several times heavier than what ordinary people would use.
