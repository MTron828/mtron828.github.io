Chapter 2350: Intoxicated (1)

Laymen watched for entertainment, while the experts watched for the skill. With Zhu Ning’s skill level, it was natural for him to better understand what he was seeing.

And because of that, Zhu Ning’s heart gave a heavy jolt when he saw Ye Qing place his prepped ingredients into the flame in his palm. Those ingredients had been prepped as well as his, perhaps with even more precision.

Zhu Ning’s face instantly paled.

He had not believed that Ye Qing knew how to refine elixirs too. But now that he was seeing the process with his own eyes, he finally realized how laughable his earlier thinking had been.

Just by the youth’s movements, Zhu Ning could confirm that Ye Qing knew very well how to refine the Green Asteroid Elixir. In fact, he might be even more familiar with it than him.

The Green Asteroid Elixir was a Master-level elixir. Without a certain level of skill, one would not be able to refine it even if one knew the recipe.

But…

Zhu Ning watched as Ye Qing placed the final ingredient into his palm. He suddenly closed his eyes and took a deep breath. In the next second, Zhu Ning extinguished the fire on his own tripod.

The crowd was stunned when they saw Zhu Ning extinguish the fire in his tripod.

“What’s the matter with Teacher Zhu? Why is he stopping?”

“What is going on?”

Everyone was dumbfounded. Things had been going on very well. Why did Zhu Ning suddenly stop?

“Teacher Zhu? What’s the matter?” The other medicine faculty teachers were also confused. They thought something must have happened to Zhu Ning, and they all went up to him.

Zhu Ning waved them off but didn’t say anything and only continued to watch Ye Qing, who was focused on refining his elixir. The arrogance in his eyes had faded away as he concentrated on watching him.

How long had it been since he was like this, completely engrossed in watching the process of someone else refine elixirs? He could no longer remember.

At this moment, he appeared absorbed, not at all like the Master-level alchemist he was. He was more like a medicine faculty student, watching Ye Qing’s movements intently as if he was very worried about missing any single detail.

Even when those teachers tried to continue their queries, Zhu Ning interrupted them to stop them from bothering him.

The medicine faculty students were dazed. They did not understand why Zhu Ning was behaving in this manner. Previously, they did not pay much attention to what Ye Qing was doing. But now that Zhu Ning was watching so closely, they instinctively turned to look.

And with that one look…

They were completely shocked.

The situation on the platform had become very strange. Zhu Ning had extinguished his tripod fire and was watching Ye Qing intently. And the eyes of those medicine faculty teachers were now glowing as they also watched Ye Qing.

All the other students were befuddled.

What was going on?

Wasn’t there a competition going on?

Why had all the teachers gone into a trance?

“Damn, they are secretly spying on our Boss’ technique!” Lei Yan muttered.

He could not understand what Boss was doing. But observing the faces of those old men, it was clear they were secretly studying his Boss’ techniques! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Lei Yan wanted to object but Yun Chen put his hand over his mouth.

“Don’t say a word.” Yun Chen’s eyes never left Ye Qing. Now, he did not wish to hear any noise either. All he wanted was to memorize every single one of Ye Qing’s movements.

Lei Yan, “…”

If Yun Chen didn’t let go, he would soon suffocate to death!

A strange atmosphere descended over the medicine faculty arena.

By the time Ran Mo hurried over with Wu Fengling, they were greeted by this strange sight.
