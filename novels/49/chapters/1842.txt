Chapter 1843: Cross-Dresser (1)

Ye Qingtang felt the world spin and by the time she opened her eyes, everything was different.

The Cemetery of the True Gods had disappeared and a quiet forest replaced it. The oppressive aura surrounding Ye Qingtang also vanished and the powers in her body slowly recovered to its normal levels...

“Have we finally gotten out of the mystic realm?” Ye Qingtang scanned her surroundings. She wasn’t certain whether she had indeed left the mystic realm or not. What if she was still in another part of it?

She stopped herself from acting rashly and stood on the spot with Little White Tiger and the three unconscious bodies. She wouldn’t be surprised if they were going to be sent back again.

But even after a while of waiting, Ye Qingtang still didn’t feel any signs of being pulled away at all and was perplexed. Was she really out of the mystic realm? Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Suddenly, she heard a moan coming from Little White Tiger’s back.

Jiang Shaobai finally woke up. His face was slightly pale and he seemed really pitiful. The moment he opened his eyes, a sharp look flashed across his eyes but when he lifted his head to look at Ye Qingtang, the look instantly vanished.

“Sister Qing?!” Jiang Shaobai was both surprised and elated to see Ye Qingtang, a wide smile appearing on his face.

Seeing that Jiang Shaobai had woken up, Ye Qingtang heaved a huge sigh of relief. When Jiang Shaobai and the others were unconscious previously, Ye Qingtang couldn’t help but worry that they would never wake up.

Now it seemed...

As long as they left the mystic realm, they would recover consciousness.

“Sister Qing, why are you here? Where are we?” Jiang Shaobai was feeling dizzy and his last memory was of the monster’s attack after everyone lost touch with each other. He continued trying to find his escape after that and fell into a huge hole...

He had no idea what happened after that.

Ye Qingtang glanced at him. Even though his face was slightly pale, judging from his steady breathing, she could tell that he had already recovered. She scoffed at him, her lips curled up into a sneer.

Jiang Shaobai froze when he noticed Ye Qingtang’s cold attitude. He frowned, showing a painful expression. “Sister Qing, my entire body hurts. Am I going to die...”

This fellow is still putting up an act?!

Ye Qingtang crossed her arms as she replied, “I’ve taken a goodlook at your body, you’re completely fine.”

“Hm?” Jiang Shaobai hadn’t figured out what she had meant.

Little White Tiger wasn’t in the mood to carry this burden who’s already awake. It shook its body so that all three of them would get down.

With that, Jiang Shaobai fell on his bum and the clothes wrapped around his body started unraveling and he was instantly naked...

When the cold wind blew, Jiang Shaobai instantly became sober. He looked at his naked self before his eyes riveted on Ye Qingtang.

“...” What the f*ck, where were his clothes?!

Jiang Shaobai’s smile stiffened.

Back when Ye Qingtang saw him bathing, he could still argue that it was because he wasn’t fully grown up and developed yet. But now... Ye Qingtang had seen him fully naked.

Even if he wasn’t fully grown... Anyone would be able to differentiate what a female... should have and should not have.
