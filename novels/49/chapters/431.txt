Chapter 432: Grant A Move (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“The girl from Xuanling Sect…” The Wind Moon Sect Elder smiled in dismay and shook his head.

“People from the Xuanling Sect, are you trying to make a joke by sending your reserve to fight against Fu Lingtian?” The Qinglin Sect Elder laughed as he stared at Elder Mo.

Elder Lin and Elder Mo remained silent. Elder Mo’s face was getting increasingly unpleasant.

Elder Qin sighed as he saw Elder Mo’s face.

Ye Qingtang was Elder Mo’s in-name disciple. Ye Qingtang could enter the Three Sect Competition because of Elder Mo’s approval.

However, now she was making a mess in the competition and was mocked by the other two sects. It was an embarrassment for Xuanling Sect, especially for Elder Mo.

“Hahaha, I have to say that Xuanling Sect’s disciples are brave.”

One of the Qinglin Sect’s disciple laughed as he looked at people of Xuanling Sect.

The Xuanling Sect disciples held their fists tightly and wanted to leave immediately.

“Ye Qingtang… she really is a disgrace to our Xuanling Sect!” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“She also dares to ask Fu Lingtian to grant her twenty moves? Is she trying to gain popularity with that?!”

“It’s the first time that I ever feel so humiliated…”

At the same time, Fu Lingtian said, “Okay, I’ll grant you with twenty moves since you are from the Xuanling Sect. But… I think twenty moves are too much. Will three be enough?”

“We shall see.” Ye Qingtang smiled.

Coldness swiped through Fu Lingtian’s eyes. He was like a ghost and suddenly approached Ye Qingtang.

“Swoosh!”

Fu Lingtian smashed his palm. The strong Martial breath rushed out of his palm and surrounded the place.

All the three sects’ disciples were astonished by the power of his smash.

It was not a rumor that Fu Lingtian had no enemies in the same level!

The force was like waves that increased gradually. The force of the smash arrived before the actual palm.

Ye Qingtang’s clothes and hair were swinging, but she did not have any movement under Fu Lingtian’s attack.

However…

Ye Qingtang suddenly moved.

Ye Qingtang dodged to the left slightly.

“Boom!”

An exploding sound spread out.

“Senior Brother Fu, this is the first move.” Ye Qingtang stared coldly at Fu Lingtian, who was frowning.

“How is that possible…”

“She dodged the attack?”

“Is that a coincidence?”

All the disciples could not believe that Ye Qingtang dodged Fu Lingtian’s first attack.

“She dodged at the most appropriate time to the most appropriate angle. Such Martial experience… It should be a coincidence,” Elder Qin said.

How much Martial experience could Ye Qingtang have at her age?

“You are very lucky.” Fu Lingtian did not stop his attack. He held his fist and smashed towards the left side of Ye Qingtang.

“Swoosh!”

Ye Qingtang’s feet shifted slightly all of a sudden. Her toes pushed on the ground gently, and she floated backward using the slight force.

“Boom!”

Fu Lingtian’s fist missed again after the exploding sound.

“Second move,” Ye Qingtang said indifferently.

“You are committing suicide.” Fu Lingtian was enraged. His leg swept out like a dragon.

Ye Qingtang placed her hands at the back, and her body floated again. The shadows overlapped each other. One could not even differentiate the real figure from the shadows.
