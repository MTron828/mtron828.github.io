Chapter 2470: Playing A Trick (4)

“Boss, the location of the statue is about ten miles away but demons are guarding it. Not only that, but many Yongle Tribe demons bearing large flags are also heading in that direction.” Mu Ziying told Ye Qingtang.

Lu Yuanxiang frowned deeply. “I didn’t expect them to all go together… we have to get there before the Yongle Tribe does!”

If they did not reach the place before the rest of the Yongle Tribe demons, they would have to wait until tomorrow. With their situation, waiting for one more day meant one more danger. The tracking marks on their bodies were too great a risk.

“Ye Qing, there are demons guarding the ancestral temple. What should we do?” The Flying Star Academy teacher looked at Ye Qing.

Lu Yuanxiang hesitated for a moment before saying, “Why don’t we kill those demons?”

“Definitely not. Firstly, we don’t know the abilities of those demons in charge of guarding the ancestral temple. Secondly, if we kill those demons, the Yongle Tribe will definitely be suspicious of us. Although they are not as smart as humans, it does not mean that they are fools.” Ye Qingtang shook her head.

Lei Yan chuckled. “Isn’t that simple? Just lure those demons away.”

“Hmm, that’s a good idea. Who will be responsible for luring the demons away?” Jing Ze was deep in thought.

Everyone’s eyes fell on Lei Yan.

Lei Yan’s expression instantly went grim when he saw this. “What are you looking at me for? I don’t know how to. No! Absolutely not!”

Ye Qingtang closed her eyes and pondered. Based on what Mu Ziying said just now, there were no blind spots in the ancestral temple. If they wanted to enter, they would have to pass the guards.

It was also impossible for someone to lure them away. It would only alert the enemy and worsen their situation.

“Yun Chen, give Ziying some of that medicinal powder,” Ye Qingtang suddenly said to Yun Chen.

Mu Ziying’s eyes glinted. “Boss, I know what you intend to do!”

…

Soon, Ye Qingtang and the rest followed Mu Ziying to the ancestral temple where the Yongle Tribe worshiped.

Three demons were guarding the front.

Apart from the Yongle Tribe, no demon could enter this ancestral temple. Once a demon intruded, the Yongle Tribe would instantly mobilize all its members.

“What are you planning, Teacher Ye Qing?” The Flying Star Academy teacher was curious.

Ye Qing did not reply and Mu Ziying took out her flying puppet.

Mu Ziying controlled the puppet to fly into the sky and threw out the powder that Yun Chen had given her. The demons did not notice a thing.

After a few breaths, the expressions of the three demons changed drastically, and their eyes became unfocused.

“Brilliant, truly brilliant!” The Flying Star Academy teacher gave Ye Qing a thumbs up. Why did he not think of this? It was so simple… Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Go now!”

Ye Qingtang waved her hand and hurriedly led everyone into the temple.

When they passed by the demons guarding the place, the three demons did not even look at Ye Qingtang and the rest. It was as though they were empty air. The guards had fallen completely into the illusion.

“Skin me alive? Fool!” Lei Yan sneered as he looked at the demon beside him.

“Ah, wait for me!” Lei Yan broke out in cold sweat when he saw that Ye Qing and the others had already entered the temple, while the demons were gradually emerging from their dream-like state. Lei Yan hurriedly slipped in.

…

“What’s going on?!”

One of the demons who had just snapped out of his trance was astonished. “I… saw a miracle? I think I just saw Demon Emperor Yongle and his demon followers return!”

“Really? I think I saw it too!”

“Me too…”

But why did the miraculous scene suddenly disappear?

What exactly happened?
