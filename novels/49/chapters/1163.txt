Chapter 1164: The Light of Hope (1)

As she watched the joy fade from Perfected Xuanchen’s face, Ye Qingtang said, “But no matter what, little You Yun can still create a batch of powerful cultivators for us…”

The mainland was currently divided into three main battlefields. They already lacked powerful cultivators, but now, the situation was worsened by the division. The Ancient You Clan was different. They had plenty of powerful cultivators, so they were not greatly affected by the division of the battlefield.

If little You Yun could create more powerful cultivators, they might have a chance… ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“In that case, let us quickly ask the twelve peak masters and Daoist Zijin to receive spirit energy from little You Yun!” Perfected Xuanchen said. But another thought came to his mind, and he felt something was amiss. So, he changed the topic and spoke carefully.

“Actually we shouldn’t act precipitately. We first have to ascertain their loyalty to this mainland. Otherwise, they might betray this mainland after becoming Yang Lords and join the Ancient You Clan. Then, we would have strengthened the enemy instead…”

As the Ancient You Clan aggressively swept through the land, there would certainly be some traitors among the major forces.

Considering the current circumstances, Perfected Xuanchen had to be cautious and prepared for the worst.

Ye Qingtang had also considered Perfected Xuanchen’s worries. But how were they to prove something like loyalty at a time like that?

One must not doubt one’s subordinates. If one doubted them, then they should not be entrusted with anything. Ye Qingtang understood this principle.

“Master, there presently is no good method of proving the depth of their loyalty to this mainland. But I think that since everyone grew up in this mainland and their relatives and friends are all here… if we should lose the battle, everyone will die. I believe everyone understands this principle. There is hope only in victory. No one will willingly go over to the enemy who has come to destroy our home,” said Ye Qingtang.

Of course, it would be best if every person’s loyalty could be individually tested. But at the moment, they lacked the time to do so.

Furthermore…

Ye Qingtang also believed they knew that if they went over to the Ancient You Clan, they would be mere lackeys in the eyes of the Clan.

Who would willingly be a lackey?

“Sigh… I hope so.” Perfected Xuanchen heaved a sigh.

After some discussion between Perfected Xuanchen and Yin Yang Perfected Lord, they summoned the twelve peak masters. Ye Qingtang also gathered Daoist Zijin, Elder Bai Kui, and all the Yin Yang Perfected Lords in the Ye and Si Families.

When everyone had congregated, they noticed that Perfected Xuanchen’s ability had already increased to the realm of Yang Lord!

The last time they saw Perfected Xuanchen, he had been a mere Yin Yang Perfected Lord. Third Heaven. How had he managed to become a Yang Lord… in the span of a few hours?

Everyone was perplexed and shocked. If they had not seen it with their own eyes, they would not have believed it.

When Perfected Xuanchen saw that everyone was present, he did not delay further and explained to everyone how his ability had increased so rapidly.

But he deliberately hid the fact that little You Yun could control the spirit energy in this mainland.

This matter was just too unbelievable. Also, Perfected Xuanchen and Ye Qingtang were worried that some might have evil designs on little You Yun if they found out about her special ability.

However, even after hiding little You Yun’s role in this matter, the issue was still shocking.

“Valley Master Xuanchen, are you saying… you have a method to make us Yang Lords?!” Daoist Zijin was shocked.
