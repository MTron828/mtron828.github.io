If she suddenly appeared at that time, she would not be able to find out anything and might even be jointly attacked by them.

Immediately, Ye Qingtang changed into an ordinary white top and stored the Yunxiao Sect disciple uniform in her space ring.

Then, Ye Qingtang walked towards the temple in great strides.

The people stood in a row in front of the temple. They seemed to be paying respects to the temple.

“Senior Brother, I was separated from the sect after I entered the mystic realm. I had been trapped in a small city all along and only escaped not long ago. May I ask what exactly happened after everyone entered the mystic realm…”

Ye Qingtang walked to the side of a Falling Sky Valley disciple with a harmless smile on her face.

Ye Qingtang was a Falling Sky Valley disciple in her past life as well and had a natural soft spot for the Falling Sky Valley.

However…

Ye Qingtang waited for a long time but did not get any response.

Even more than that, those Falling Sky Valley disciples did not even spare Ye Qingtang a look.

It was not just the Falling Sky Valley disciples, but even the numerous people at the front did not seem to want to respond to Ye Qingtang.

“Humph!”

The Blood Moon Elder scoffed coldly. “My Holy… My Young Sir is talking to you all. Why are you all not responding to him!”

Ye Qingtang had a slight headache when she saw the Blood Moon Elder’s response and pinched her glabella.

This Blood Moon Elder did not have much skill presently, yet he was still arrogant. Every word he said could ignite a battle. Could it be that he still wanted to kill her…

But what Ye Qingtang could not understand was that those Nine Nights Dynasty people simply turned a deaf ear to the Blood Moon Elder and did not respond.

“Fellow people, I’m also from the Nine Nights Dynasty camp…” Ye Qingtang explained.

“That’s right. My Young Sir and I are from the Nine Nights Dynasty. Once we enter this mystic realm, everyone belongs to the same camp. If you have any news, it is only right to share it.” The Blood Moon Elder echoed and nodded hurriedly.

…

There was still no response.

Before waiting for Ye Qingtang to speak again, the young male who was the first in line suddenly drew a long sword out of its sheath.

Noticing the situation, Ye Qingtang frowned immediately, not knowing why that person had unsheathed his sword.

Swoosh!

In the next second, Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder exchanged a look with each other with mouths hung ajar.

That young male actually brandished his sword without saying anything and chopped his own head off!

The headless body took a few steps forward. Fresh blood splattered all over the ground and was instantly absorbed into the ground like water entering sand.

“This!” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The Blood Moon Elder was stupefied.?Could it be that the disciple lost his mind and killed himself?!

Without giving Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder any time to react, the second person walked forward, unsheathed his sword similarly without saying anything, and beheaded himself.

Rumble…

The head fell to the ground and rolled forward like a rubber ball, leaving a trail of blood on the ground.

And the trail of blood was completely absorbed by the ground almost instantly.

“I… I have sinned… I have sinned…”

The third person mumbled in between miserable wails. He had a malevolent expression as he laughed crazily. Ultimately, his hands clutched onto his skull and forcefully pulled it apart from his body with brute force.

Blood spouted out from the neck and into the sky. Once the fresh blood touched the ground, it was once again absorbed.

With his head in his hands, the third person staggered forward a few steps before eventually collapsing and dying.

Even the Blood Moon Elder could not help but gasp at the sight.

His Blood Moon Sect was claimed to be the first demonic sect by everyone, and as a Blood Moon Elder, he had seen many violent scenes in his lifetime and had committed innumerable murders, never knowing what mercy meant.

However…

After seeing this scene today, his scalp still tingled, and he found it hard to disbelief.
