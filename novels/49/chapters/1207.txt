1208 Blood Battle 10

“Brother… Are you the Heavenly Emperor… Is this body a duplicate…” Ye Qingtang looked at the Blood Moon Holy Lord and said. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Previously, she knew from the Blood Moon Elder that the Blood Moon Holy Lord was a duplicate of the Heavenly Emperor. However, Ye Qingtang did not know who the Heavenly Emperor was.

The Blood Moon Holy Lord turned his head and looked at Ye Qingtang as he heard her voice.

“Do you want to know the truth?” The Blood Moon Holy Lord asked softly.

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang said.

“Okay, then stay alive. We’ll meet again soon… And I’ll tell you everything before I kill you.” The Blood Moon Holy Lord raised his right arm, trying to touch Ye Qingtang’s face.

However, at the last moment, the Blood Moon Holy Lord’s body became lusters and disappeared.

“Spirit incarnation…” Ye Qingtang showed a complicated expression as the Blood Moon Holy Lord disappeared.

Spirit incarnations were very different from duplicates. The Blood Moon Elder was a duplicate that was not under the control of the main body. However, the spirit incarnation was totally controlled by the main body. When the incarnation died, the spirit power would return to the main body…

“Heavenly Emperor…” Ye Qingtang mumbled.

He had definitely reached the Emperor-level… Why would an emperor’s spirit incarnation pledge with her and want to kill her… but eventually, save her…

“Qingtang…”

Perfected Xuanchen slightly recovered after a while. He stumbled towards Ye Qingtang.

The few remaining disciples of the Ye Family also followed.

“Eldest Young Lady… we…”

Daoist Zijin could not say anything as he looked at the hell in front of him.

There were less than a hundred people left in the Ye Family.

Ye Ling and a few other Elders did not join the battle as their abilities were not up to the standard.

Ye Qingtang clenched her fists and did not say anything as she stared at everyone of the Ye Family.

…

There were many tombs that appeared in the valley on the second day.

Perfected Xuanchen and Daoist Zijin followed Ye Qingtang and bowed towards the tombs.

No one would know how many heroes were buried under the tombs here.

They used their blood to protect this mainland.

They did not give up even in the last moments of their lives.

“I, Ye Qingtang, swear here!”

“As long as I am still alive, the Ancient You Clan will pay their price one day… WITH THEIR BLOOD!”

Ye Qingtang took out a dagger and made a deep cut on her arm under everyone’s gaze.

“Eldest Young Lady!”

Daoist Zijin was shocked.

“As long as the Ancient You Clan is still alive… The scar will remain!” Ye Qingtang said coldly.

Ye Qingtang kneeled down as she finished her words. She kowtowed constantly towards the tombs until her forehead was injured and blood stained the ground.

“They’ll pay back with their blood!”

“They’ll pay back with their blood!”

Everyone of the Ye Family shouted together.

Those who were buried under the tombs were all their siblings that they lived with in the past. All of them…

The little white tiger stared at Ye Qingtang and sighed but did not say anything.

Daoist Zijin walked to Elder Bai Kui’s tomb. Tears ran down the old man’s face even though he was more than a hundred years old.

“Old friend… This time, I’ll never see you again after you leave me…”
