Chapter 890 Devote Your Life To Me

“Ye You stole Miss Ye’s spirit root, but that spirit root does not belong to Ye You. I stole Ye You’s Heavenly Demon Pearl, and it should not belong to me either. No matter what, it is the equivalent of this Heavenly Demon Pearl being Ye You’s interest to Miss Ye.” A faint smile hung on Ling Yan’s lips.

Before Ye Qingtang could say anything, Ling Yan grabbed her hand lightly and placed the Heavenly Demon Pearl in her palm before giving her any time to react. “This Heavenly Demon Pearl should belong to you. There’s no need to decline.”

“You…” Ye Qingtang looked at Ling Yan, astonished.

Although Ling Yan put it that way, it was clear that whatever reasoning he gave was fallacious. Ye Qingtang was not foolish and could tell that Ling Yan merely wanted to give her the Heavenly Demon Pearl.

“Ling Yan, the Heavenly Demon Pearl is really too valuable… There’s nothing between us…” Ye Qingtang frowned deeply.

“Since that’s the case, do you want to have something with me?” Ling Yan’s eyes were extremely bright and filled with charm as he looked at Ye Qingtang.

“What thing?” Ye Qingtang asked instinctively.

However, Ling Yan inched closer the moment she spoke, and their eyes locked onto each other. There was less than an inch between them, and they could even feel each other’s heartbeat and breathing.

Ye Qingtang swore that she had never been so close to a man in either of her lives before.

Just like that, the two of them looked at each other for a long time. Suddenly, Ling Yan stood up straight and pulled a distance away from Ye Qingtang. “Let’s put it this way then: my martial skills are so terrible, and I can lose my life anytime… How about you stay by my side from now on?”

“You want me to be your personal bodyguard?’ Ye Qingtang asked.

Ling Yan shook his head immediately. “Apart from a personal bodyguard, there’s another possibility between a male and a female.”

Without giving Ye Qingtang a chance to speak, Ling Yan suddenly stood up and said, “Miss Ye, you do not need to be so conflicted. The Heavenly Demon Pearl is useless to me and is compatible with you instead. If you don’t want it, you can settle it yourself. I just do not wish for this inheritance to land in the hands of one of the people of the Jiang bloodline. If you view me as a friend, you can accept it without worrying. Otherwise, you can settle it yourself. Destroying or throwing it away is all fine.”

“How generous of you…”

Ye Qingtang could not help but take a few looks at Ling Yan.

Back then, she had the Heart of the Demon God and was being chased for her life for hundreds of years. Everyone coveted the Heart of the Demon God in her body and plotted all sorts of schemes. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Others wanted to take her life in order to seize a precious treasure, but Ling Yan willingly gave the inheritance of the Heavenly Demon, a valuable treasure, to herself so easily…

“Thank you…” A long while later, Ye Qingtang said. “I am unable to return your huge favor…”

“Unable to return my huge favor…” Ling Yan walked to Ye Qingtang’s side and slowly bent forward. The corner of his lips curled up slightly and formed a devilish charm. “Since you are unable to return the favor, you can devote your life to me then.”

A few breaths later, Ye Qingtang finally returned to her senses and said. “Devote my life to you?”

Ling Yan chuckled. “How does devoting your life to me sound?”

“You’re saying…” Ye Qingtang pondered deeply and said. “For me to be your guard and protect your safety for my entire life?”

With a smile on his face, Ling Yan responded. “If that is how you comprehend the meaning of ‘devoting your life to me’, so be it then.”

For Ye Qingtang, who was a complete blockhead at male-female relationships, how could she understand the meaning of ‘devoting your life to me’?
