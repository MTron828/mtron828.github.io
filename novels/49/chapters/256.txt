The youth’s sight landed on the mountains that were at least a few hundred meters in height. His face suddenly tensed, and he asked nervously, “Senior Brother, are we going to climb the mountain?” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

His voice was filled with childishness and bewilderment.

The young man chuckled. “Climb the mountain? That’s not necessary at all. We will have to travel on foot if we climb over the mountain now.”

The youth bit his lips and did not know what to do.

The two of them were chatting as if they had never seen Ye Qingtang and the group of people there. However, none of the people from the Xuanling Sect dared to have any reaction.

The opposite side was Wind Moon Sect’s inner sect disciples, and they were just the outer sect disciples. The difference between inner and outer sects was immense. They did not feel that it was inappropriate to be neglected.

The difference was meant to be like that.

The young man noticed the bewilderment on the youth’s face, and he was more amused. “Junior Brother, do you still remember the Linyue Sword moves that Master taught you half a month ago?”

The youth nodded timidly.

The young man then lifted his hand and pointed to the stretch of mountains.

“Today you will use the moves to split the mountain.”

Zhou Qu and the rest were stunned when they heard what the young man just said.

Split the mountain?

Everyone looked at the innocent youth. They could not make the connection between splitting the mountain and the youth in front of them.

However…

The youth hesitated for a moment, but he came down from the horse when he saw the young man’s seriousness. The little hand pulled out the sword by his waist slowly.

The little guy that seemed to be weak and vulnerable suddenly waved his sword the next second. A violent wind gathered around him as he waved the sword.

All of a sudden!

A sword breath was concentrated on the sword, and he immediately swung his sword towards the mountain.

The intangible sword breath rushed downwards. A streak of cool light emerged, and the sword breath that was formed by the wind smashed onto the mountain.

Within a second, a huge crack appeared on the steep mountain. Millions of cracked stones flew into the stretch of ridges. A direct path was split out.

The scene really shocked Zhou Qu and the rest.

They looked at the vulnerable youth again. If they did not witness that with their own eyes, they would never believe the move was done by such a young man.

“Is this okay, Senior Brother?” The youth did not notice the gazes on him. He just turned to ask his Senior Brother.

The young man squinted his eyes and said, “Not too bad, but you are still not very familiar with the moves. I will teach you again when we return to the sect.”

The youth nodded and climbed up the horse. The two of them then casually went towards the path that was just created.

Qin Huan sighed heavily as the two people left.

“I know that the difference between the inner and outer sect is huge, but this is the first time that I actually experienced how terrifying the difference is… ”

Qin Huan was astonished. He always thought that his ability was not too bad, but it was incomparable to the youth from the inner sect of the Wind Moon Sect.

“How old is that child? At most twelve or thirteen years old? How can he be so strong…” One of the Xuanling Sect disciples shivered. They only understood how horrible it was for them to never be able to close the gap.

The power that was able to split the mountain with one sword was extremely ferocious!
