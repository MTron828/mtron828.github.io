Chapter 1359 You Are Deliberately Provoking Me 1

General Qiao froze for a moment, but before he could reply, his wife threw herself at Dongfang Qing as if she suffered some terrible grievance.

“Elder Brother, if I had listened to you and gotten rid of that crazy girl earlier, this would not have happened. See.. she actually dared to treat me like this… There is no place for Lin’er and me in the General’s residence.” The General’s wife pushed the fiery red finger imprints on her face in front of Dongfang Qing, as if afraid he could not see them.

Dongfang Qing’s expression grew grim as he looked coldly at General Qiao.

“If Brother Su cannot bear to take a lunatic like this in hand, then I better take over.”

General Qiao’s expression stiffened. Although Dongfang Qing did not have an official position in court, his skills in refining elixirs were greatly valued by the Emperor. Even General Qiao had to be civil to him.

However…

General Qiao looked at Ye Qingtang again, and his expression became conflicted.

However, before General Qiao could speak, Dongfang Qing rushed at Ye Qingtang with the group from the Dongfang Family that had come with him.

In his eyes, Su Qiao was only a helpless girl and a lunatic. They could capture her easily. And since Su Qiao would certainly struggle in the process, if they pretended to accidentally kill her while capturing her, it would be too late for General Qiao to protect her even if he wished to do so.

“Wait a minute!” General Qiao suddenly spoke. He seemed about to stop them, but his wife collapsed in his arms, pretending to be frail. She clung to him such that he was unable to free himself.

Ye Qingtang looked expressionlessly at the group from the Dongfang Family who had surrounded her. Her gaze suddenly passed over the God of Nature, who was following behind her.

At that moment, the God of Nature looked delighted. However, Ye Qingtang realized that others could not see the God of Nature.

“As long as everyone in the General’s residence submits to me, my mission is complete?” Ye Qingtang suddenly spoke to the God of Nature.

“That’s right.” The God of Nature was prepared to watch a good show.

Ye Qingtang’s lips suddenly curved in amusement as she looked at the group from the Dongfang Family with their evil intentions.

Be it General Qiao or Dongfang Kai, their abilities were so poor that Ye Qingtang was not even interested in exerting herself. But when she saw so many people rush at her, she thought she might as well test whether the people in these worlds were really so incredibly weak.

The group from the Dongfang Family had not heard the conversation between Ye Qingtang and the God of Nature. They simply followed Dongfang Qing’s instructions and rushed forward to capture her.

But when they had advanced and just rolled up their sleeves to catch and kill this lunatic, a cold light suddenly flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

A blast of air suddenly rose from Ye Qingtang’s feet, and her figure vanished instantly. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Before Dongfang Qing could see Ye Qingtang, he suddenly felt a huge force attacking him from behind.

He was instantly sent flying!

No one present knew what was going on. They only saw a flash of light that looked like lightning, rushing around them. The light passed in an instant, leaving chaos in its wake.

The men from the Dongfang Family did not know what was going on. They were sent flying in all directions by this invisible force.
