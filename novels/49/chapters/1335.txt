Chapter 1336 Checkmate 2

“What the f*ck. What is going on…” The little white tiger seemed shocked.

Ye Qingtang remained silent. Looking at the scene before her, everything was clear.

It had been the Eternal Emperor’s one man show from the beginning. He treated everyone as a chess piece, including Ling Yan, Eldest Prince, and the rest…

“Oh… Son, it seems like you already know about it.” The Eternal Emperor snickered.

“Father, your Emperor title is the most important to you. You appointed me as the Crown Prince only to balance the situation… To prevent a single party from becoming too powerful, the best way for you is for all your children to die… This way, no one will be able to threaten your position as the Emperor. Isn’t that it?” Ling Yan chuckled lightly.

“Is that what you think?” The Eternal Emperor asked.

“No Emperor would want to step down from his position… Unfortunately, your children have all grown up while you have aged, and you need to pass down the position to your children… To extend your time as the Emperor, you intentionally appointed the Fourth Prince as the Crown Prince… Afterward, you personally killed him to lower the guard of the Eldest Prince and the rest. Then, you appointed me as the Crown Prince to create a situation where my royal brother and sisters would fight it out with me. A pretty good plot,” Ling Yan said with a smile.

Many people guessed that either the Eldest Prince or Second Princess was responsible for the Fourth Prince’s death. Yet, no one would have thought that the true murderer of the Fourth Prince was the Eternal Emperor…

“Anything else?” The Eternal Emperor asked interestedly.

“Of course.” Ling Yan nodded slightly and spoke. “Royal brother and sister plotted to frame me as a rebel. Thus, they intentionally showed weakness to me and allowed my forces to strengthen… Over the past few days, I hid millions of troops within the Imperial City, and it’s impossible for you to not know. Earlier on, you allowed me to leave the palace merely to use me to kill my royal siblings. Once that is so, you have a reason to execute me, the current Crown Prince… while you can keep your Emperor title forever without any worries.”

“Hahahaha!” The Eternal Emperor erupted in laughter after hearing Ling Yan out and looked at him in slight admiration. “Not bad. Truly not bad… You’re indeed my son. You live up to the reputation of having a demon-like intelligence.”

Hearing that the Eternal Emperor admitted to the charges, the Black Armor troops which General Wu Hu brought were all stunned and even in disbelief.

In order to not step down from his position, the Eternal Emperor actually passed the Crown Prince position to the youngest Fourth Prince and subsequently killed him in order to start a strife.

Afterward, he then passed the Crown Prince position to the weakest Ling Yan and allowed him to strengthen his power without interfering… Ultimately, he used Ling Yan to kill the Eldest Prince, Eldest Princess, and Second Princess…

This way, the Eternal Emperor had a reason to execute Ling Yan!

Then, all of the Eternal Emperor’s children would be dead… and he could keep his Emperor title forever!

How malicious and scheming…

“Ling Yan, surrender yourself, and I will allow you to die in one piece.” The Eternal Emperor snickered coldly as he looked at the calm Ling Yan.

“Allow me to die in one piece…” Ling Yan smiled at the Eternal Emperor. “So… why do you believe that you will definitely defeat me?” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Although the Eternal Emperor had a frightening martial cultivation base, Ling Yan’s current forces were even more terrifying, and the Eternal Emperor could not go against Ling Yan by himself.

“With him, what do you think?” The Eternal Emperor looked in the distance.
