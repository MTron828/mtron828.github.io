it was unlike this world, where being a hundred years old was already considered longevity.

the reason that ye qingtang used the pill to deceive the emperor was so that the emperor would go according to her plans.

using the emperor’s powers to set up a sect in the yuan kingdom and preach to the citizens could easily complete the god of nature’s second mission.

seeing that ye qingtang did not reply, the emperor could not help but feel nervous.

“rest assured, immortal. we will not interfere with anything that you do in the yuan kingdom. whether you are willing to preach or not is up to you, immortal.”

the emperor spoke with caution in fear that he would piss the immortal away.

seeing that she had put on airs sufficiently, ye qingtang said with reluctance, “since it is to preach and guide the humans in the world, it is not impossible.”

the emperor’s heart finally relaxed after hearing what ye qingtang said.

“your kindness is admirable. rest assured, immortal. everything will be arranged suitably,” the emperor said.

ye qingtang nodded slightly.

currently, the dongfang family were so fearful that they did not even dare to let out a fart. seized with terror, they kneeled on the ground in trepidation and reverence.

since ye qingtang agreed to preach in the yuan kingdom, given her identity as an “immortal”, she naturally would not continue to stay in a general’s residence.

the emperor specially arranged a new residence for ye qingtang, which was much larger than the general’s residence.

although she moved out of the general’s residence, general qiao also benefited from this incident.

there was a saying that “when a man attains the tao, even his pets ascend to heaven”. not only was general qiao not implicated by dongfang qing’s death, but his official rank even increased successively. in contrast, the premiere’s family was startled after knowing that the previously dimwitted su qiao was the reincarnation of an immortal.

su qiao’s initial fiance, especially, could not sleep the entire night and was filled with surprise and regret after learning about it.

if su mo’er was not the general’s daughter as well, the premiere’s family would already have kicked her out of the house a long time ago. however, despite so, they treated her with a bad attitude plenty of times.

after all…

everyone was aware that su mo’er and su qiao were not on good terms.

even the general’s wife, who was waiting for good news in the dongfang residence, was completely dumbfounded to hear that su qiao was the reincarnation of an immortal.

the dongfang family naturally did not dare to let the general’s wife stay for long and chased her out in no time.

on her way back, the general’s wife received a certificate of divorcement.

general qiao divorced her!

ye qingtang remained in the elegant manor newly provided by the emperor.

ye qingtang made use of this time to cultivate as she still had some time for cultivation before the emperor finished the preparations.

although this world’s martial realm was pitifully low, the spirit energy was extremely nourishing.

ye qingtang merely cultivated in seclusion for a few days, but her skills improved by leaps and bounds. every time she advanced by a heaven, a layer of red gleam enveloped her manor.

the citizens in the imperial city were boiling with excitement.

as the yuan kingdom’s emperor admired immortals, the entire kingdom followed in his footsteps and respected immortals greatly over time.

the citizens watched the red gleam.

in a few days, all sorts of offerings were placed outside ye qingtang’s manor, and citizens worshiped her at her door regardless of day or night.
