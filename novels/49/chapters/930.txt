Chapter 931 Inheritance Of The Bloodline 2

“Of course, we must continue. It’s the rule,” replied the Divine Phoenix.

A scarlet gleam immediately shrouded Ye Qingtang.

“Superior martial talent, yellow spirit root among the red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue and purple of the mortal world.” The Divine Phoenix muttered in disappointment.

The truth was that no matter what kind of spirit root Ye Qingtang had, it was not important to the Divine Phoenix. Even if the girl in green had a red spirit root, she still had the phoenix bloodline.

Ye Qingtang saw that if matters continued in this vein, she would not be destined to obtain the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix. With a flash of light, a golden image of a phoenix emerged behind Ye Qingtang, and the call of the phoenix rang out from her mouth.

The next moment, golden flames erupted from Ye Qingtang’s body.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang’s entire body was covered in flames. Added to the image of the phoenix behind her, her entire person looked like a Divine Phoenix undergoing the Rise of the Phoenix.

This scene caused the Divine Phoenix’s expression to change. “Ultimate Origin Skill… Rise of the Phoenix…”

When the girl in green saw the golden image of a phoenix behind Ye Qingtang, she wrinkled her elegant brows slightly.

The Ultimate Origin Skill was derived from Paragon Skills. Although it was not part of the phoenix bloodline, to be able to understand the Paragon Skill related to the phoenix meant that the person had a close connection with the phoenix. Her Paragon Skill was already so formidable; what’s more, it was her Ultimate Origin Skill.

Legend had it that before the world was created, a true god existed in the universe. After the world appeared, the true god fell, and every true god was subject to rebirth, and they were reborn as humans.

According to legends, once any cultivator understood the Paragon Skill, it was as if his body remembered the genetic composition of the true god and longed to return to its shrine.

Those who understood Ultimate Origin Skill were even more powerful.

In other words, this girl who had understood the Ultimate Origin Skill, Rise of the Phoenix, was even more suited to the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix then the girl in green with the phoenix bloodline.

“Yes, not bad.” The Divine Phoenix withdrew the scarlet glow and said to Ye Qingtang.

“If I may ask the Lord Divine Phoenix, which of us is more suitable to be your successor?” The girl in green asked. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Although you are very suitable, unfortunately, she is even more suitable,” said the Divine Phoenix.

“What?!”

When she heard the Divine Phoenix’s reply, the smile was wiped off the girl in green’s face.

The girl in green had not expected the Divine Phoenix to respond like that.

The truth was that the girl in green was from a mutated demonic bloodline which could absorb the power of all the bloodlines in the world.

Half a year ago, she had killed a girl who had the phoenix bloodline, then used her own mutated demonic bloodline to swallow her opponent’s phoenix bloodline, and transformed it into a part of herself.

This time, she had relied on her possessing the phoenix bloodline and was certain that she could obtain the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix.

That was why she had not wavered at all when faced with the Dharma treasures earlier.

Yet, who would have thought… this would be the outcome!

“Is that so…” The girl in green’s icy cold look fell on Ye Qingtang. “Then I must congratulate you.”

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly when she sensed the cold gleam that shimmered in the eyes of the girl in green.

This girl, who peak martial talents, a blue spirit root, and phoenix bloodline, gave one a sense of inscrutable power. She could also tell that after the Divine Phoenix chose her as its successor, the girl in green would be very hostile towards her.

“Go back.”

Without giving Ye Qingtang an opportunity to speak, the Divine Phoenix issued a command, and the girl in green’s body turned transparent before being she was sent out.
