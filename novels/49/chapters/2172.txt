Chapter 2173: Training (5)

Qin Feng remained silent and only fled the scene with a grim face. Qin Xuan was delighted at the sight of Qin Feng’s pathetic escape.

Meanwhile, Lei Yan was being dragged away by Nangong Lie before he could understand what was happening.

“What are you doing? You want to lash me again?” Lei Yan whined.

Nangong Lie couldn’t resist rolling his eyes.

“I have met stupid people but I have never met someone as stupid as you. Be sure to pray harder for your match in five days.”

“What?” Lei Yan still didn’t understand.

Nangong Lie pointed at Qin Xuan, who had already walked a distance away. “Don’t you know who he is?”

“No idea. Who?”

“Qin Xuan,” Nangong Lie replied.

Lei Yan was taken aback. “Qin Xuan? The prodigy from the internal cultivation faculty?”

Nangong Lie nodded. “He is from the same family as Qin Feng. But they are not on good terms... Brother, I had believed that you might be able to endure ten moves, but now, I think you have no hope. Didn’t you sense the tension between Qin Feng and Qin Xuan earlier? And you foolishly went to tell Qin Xuan all about the bet between you and Qin Feng... You are just asking for it, giving Qin Feng more reason to beat you up.”

It didn’t take much for Nangong Lie to know that Qin Xuan’s earlier words were meant to provoke Qin Feng. It was already a rare feat that Qin Feng wasn’t angered to death.

At this moment, Lei Yan finally realized what a deplorable mistake he made...

His face instantly fell.

“I... I didn’t do it on purpose...”

His mind had been all fuzzy. How was he to know what he had been saying?

Nangong Lie rolled his eyes again.

“Say... do you think Qin Feng will have mercy on me if I apologize to him now?” Lei Yan asked.

The corners of Nangong Lie’s lips twitched.

“What do you think?”

Lei Yan felt like crying.

“How about I bring a bunch of guys to beat up Qin Xuan?”

The moment he said it, Lei Yan immediately realized how foolish that was. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

What a joke. He couldn’t even beat Qin Feng. How to beat up the even more powerful Qin Xuan?

His gang would probably flee like scared rabbits the moment they heard Qin Xuan’s name...

Lei Yan was doomed.

Within moments, news of the fight between Qin Feng and Lei Yan and everyone in the entire Netherworld Academy knew of it.

Quite a number of them found it very amusing.

No matter how much Qin Feng’s powers declined, there was no way Lei Yan could manage him.

And 10 moves.

Qin Feng could probably settle Lei Yan with just one.

But everyone had nothing better to do and wanted to see a good show. Especially those who were at odds with Lei Yan. They really wanted to see just how badly Lei Yan would be beaten up, without the protection of the other Leiting family teenagers.

“Qin Feng is fighting Lei Yan?” The eyebrows of an elder rose in surprise when he heard of the news.

Standing by the side with a humble expression, Qin Xuan nodded.

“I also heard the news of that. When I last saw Brother Feng, I tried to dissuade him from associating with people like Lei Yan, but...”

“Humph.” The elder snorted coldly.

“If he wishes to let himself go, no one can help him. Qin Xuan, both you and Qin Feng are from the same Qin family. I don’t wish to see you follow in his footsteps.”

Lei Yan didn’t have a good reputation in the Netherworld Academy. Apart from his own people from the Leiting family, all the other students kept away from him.

But Qin Feng was now mixing with a guy like him. It was lamentable.

Qin Xuan immediately answered, “Master, don’t worry. I will never let myself go like that.”
