The giant trees around them were starting to collapse and the rumbling of the ground around them was getting worse.

“Holy Lady, what’s happening?” The Blood Moon Elder was extremely surprised. The shaking was too great.

But more than that, the Blood Moon Elder could feel a terrible and great power slowly recovering and with it brought a heavy sense of oppression, as though… a real demon god was rising.

The Blood Moon Elder was soaked in a cold sweat. Under the oppressive power, he was breathless and extremely pale.

It wasn’t just him. Ye Qingtang was feeling the discomfort rise from within her as cold sweat started to bead her forehead.

Whether it was in this life or her previous one, this was the first time she had felt such a terrifying aura. Under this aura, she was unable to muster even an ounce of resistance and even wanted to kneel and worship it.

“Is this… an illusion?” The Blood Moon Elder looked terrified. He couldn’t fathom how such an unbelievably great power could exist. Who was the owner of this aura?

Even Ye Qingtang was starting to suspect that this wasn’t just an illusion. This aura was way too terrifying. The above-Emperor level monsters were mere ants compared to this giant.

“We’re done for, we’re done for, we’re done for… we are thoroughly done for this time. I really didn’t expect to die so quickly after being brought back to life. How frustrating!” The Blood Moon Elder slapped his leg in annoyance. He was feeling a little aggrieved about his revival.

He seemed to think of something as he said that and his gaze quickly landed on the big yellow dog. “Brother Canine, do you have any way of dealing with the owner of this aura?”

The big yellow dog wagged his tail after hearing that and said, “If this was the past, I would’ve killed it in just one bite.”

The Blood Moon Elder stared at the big yellow dog in awe and gave it a thumbs up. “Brother Canine, you’re amazing… I can’t even describe my admiration for you… What about now?”

“Now?” The big yellow dog pondered for a moment before finally speaking, “Now… can’t you see that I’m just a dog? I don’t think you’re expecting a dog to do anything?”

Hearing that, the Blood Moon Elder stared at the big yellow dog blankly. What did it mean? It used to be able to kill it with just one bite but now it was just a dog? Hadn’t it always been a dog?

Boom!

Without waiting for the Blood Moon Elder to say another word, the ground shook as the hills and rivers split apart. The sound was so loud that it made one’s ears throb in pain.

“Run!”

Ye Qingtang had no time to think any further. She grabbed the big yellow dog and the Blood Moon Elder and quickly sprinted out of there.

Boom!

Standing on the barren land, they noticed a huge hole within the Wailing Well.

In front of their naked eyes, a huge arm burst forth from the ground and pierced the sky. It was surrounded by green tendons and was grabbing at the sky blindly.

It happened to grab an elder near the altar.

The elder was nothing in the palm of its hand.. No matter how hard he struggled, he wasn’t able to break free and was trapped in it like a rabbit in a cage.
