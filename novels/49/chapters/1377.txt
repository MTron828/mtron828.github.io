the yuan emperor was big and fleshy. although he had muttered to himself, his voice was so loud that many of the other disciples heard him.

the qi emperor, who had previously looked down on the yuan emperor, heard it and laughed coldly. “yuan emperor, don’t forget yourself. the immortal wine given by the immortal cannot be drunk whenever you like.”

the yuan emperor’s face darkened with resentment, but he was afraid of breaking the rules, so he did not dare to say anything.

but many people thought it was funny.

not long after the qi emperor finished speaking, a huge jade door at the front of the hall slowly opened.

the believers, who had been talking among themselves, immediately fell silent when they saw the jade door open. everyone’s eyes turned to look at the slowly opening door with respect and reverence.

clang… clang…

the clear notes of a brass gong rang out from the doorway. layers of mist billowed through the door and into the main hall. a few figures could be vaguely seen at the doorway.

everyone in the main hall was surrounded by mist. as they looked at the billowing immortal aura, they were filled with a sense of awe, and their expressions were reverent.

a moment later, a few handsome men dressed in white suddenly flew through the jade door, suspended in midair. there was nothing beneath their feet, yet they moved through the air as if walking on level ground.

they looked to be at most twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old and were handsome. however, their tilted chins and chilly looks gave them a remote and unapproachable air. in the mist, their white robes made them seem even more aloof.

these were the ambassadors of the dragon court sect.

ye qingtang raised her brows slightly. she looked at the flying ambassadors of the dragon court sect and then glanced at the yuan emperor.

the yuan emperor was completely taken aback by the flying ambassadors.

he had never attended pilgrimage day and had not seen the dragon court sect’s ambassadors before. he had only heard that the immortal had bestowed flying abilities on the dragon court sect’s ambassadors.

so when ye qingtang had taken flight previously, he had been shocked and believed that she was an immortal.

besides the dragon court sect’s ambassadors who had received the immortal’s blessing, who else could fly?

the mist swirled around, obscuring the entire hall.

the believers felt blessed as they bathed in the “immortal aura”. they blissfully enjoyed the sensation of being encircled by immortal aura.

“immortal, thank you for your favor in nourishing us with your immortal aura,” a monarch said gratefully.

the ambassadors looked remote and nodded slightly. although they were suspended in midair, they all stood steadily.

the yuan emperor had heard that on pilgrimage day, if the immortal wished to, he could pass among the believers through the immortal aura. now that he personally saw the immortal aura surround him, he was filled with delight and surprise. he breathed deeply, hoping to suck in more immortal aura.

before they entered the hall, everyone on the shores of the floating island had been under the hot sun for some time. these pampered monarchs and members of the royal family were already showing faint signs of heatstroke, with each face redder than the next. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

but after breathing in the immortal aura, their dizziness cleared immediately, and their complexion returned to normal. they were also re-energized.

ye qingtang glanced at the immortal aura floating past her. her face was expressionless.

“today is the pilgrimage day. the immortal gives you wine.” the ambassadors seemed used to all this and took no notice of the delighted crowd that was absorbing the immortal aura.

only when the ambassadors spoke did the believers in the hall reach out to pour the wine.
