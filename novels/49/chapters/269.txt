The Elder’s face suddenly changed at the next second. He pulled back immediately to avoid Ye Qingtang’s sword piercing through his body.

Ye Qingtang’s attack did hurt the Elder of the Blood Moon Sect, but it did not meet her expectations. She frowned as she landed. However, she felt the pain from her shoulder and turned to look at it instinctively. The clothes on her shoulder were dyed red by blood, but she suddenly felt delighted.

It seemed like…

It was not as terrible as what she imagined.

Ye Qingtang covered the wound on her shoulder. Though it was injured severely by the Elder’s hand, this was totally incomparable to the pain of the disciple who was smashed into pieces previously.

A shocking thought emerged in her brain. She raised her head and stared at the Elder of the Blood Moon Sect. Her eyes were fierce. Without any hesitation, she raised her sword and dashed forward again. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The Elder of the Blood Moon Sect struck back immediately.

The moment when Ye Qingtang approached the Elder, she lowered her body and lifted up her left arm. She pierced her sword directly at the Elder’s abdomen area while her arm resisted the Elder’s smash.

The Elder of the Blood Moon Sect smashed his hand down, but he felt a stabbing pain by his waist. He was stunned and backed off.

Ye Qingtang hunched her body and looked at the arm that was smashed by the Elder. She rolled up her sleeves and stared at the blue-black area on her arm. It was very obvious on her white skin.

However…

Ye Qingtang sneered as she saw the blue-black area on her arm. She raised her head and looked towards the Elder of the Blood Moon Sect, who was astonished.

It was not her illusion.

She was correct.

Ye Qingtang had previously suspected that the Elder of the Blood Moon Sect was bluffing. He should not need to use the enchanting voice to delude the disciples with his full power. However, Ye Qingtang gave up on this thought when she witnessed the disciple being smashed into pieces.

However…

The first attack smashed her sword, but the strength of the next two was weakening.

Ye Qingtang straightened her body and smiled.

It seemed like the Elder of the Blood Moon Sect just came back to life not long ago. His strength had not recovered yet. Everything just now was done by the enchanting voice to delude people.

The few attacks had used up all the strength that he recovered.

The Elder of the Blood Moon Sect froze as he looked at Ye Qingtang’s smiling face. “Little girl, you are quite talented and brave. Today, I’ll let you go.”

The Elder of the Blood Moon Sect then wanted to leave.

However…

Ye Qingtang had figured out that he was just bluffing. How could she just let him go away now?

She jumped in front of the Elder and stabbed her sword towards his face.

The Elder opened his eyes wide. He did not expect to meet such a weird disciple. His enchanting voice did not work on her at all! This person was insane. She dared to challenge him even when she knew that he was the Elder of the Blood Moon Sect!
