The expressions of the two Xuanling Sect elders were rather ugly as they did not expect the matter to be related to the Blood Moon Sect. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“The Blood Moon Sect had been exterminated for thousands of years. I really never thought that there would be traces of resurrection.” Elder Lin’s brows were tightly furrowed. He looked at the group, and his eyes eventually fell on Ye Qingtang.

“Did you see the Blood Moon Sect Elder leave with your own eyes?”

Ye Qingtang looked up, and a cold expression darted across her eyes when she made eye contact with the domineering Elder Lin.

Elder Lin…

They really had a fate!

In her previous life, it was Elder Lin from the inner sect’s Sword Faction who secretly went after her life after discovering her Heart of the Demon God, and Senior Brother Yun died in Elder Lin’s hands in order to protect her!

Ye Qingtang knew that there would ultimately be a day where she would meet with Elder Lin again after entering Xuanling Sect, but meeting him now, the desire to murder him in her intensified.

If not for Elder Lin back then, there would have been no way the world would know that the Heart of the Demon God was in Ye Qingtang’s body, Ye Qingtang would not have ended up in the distressing situation of being hunted down by everyone, and Yun Shu would not have died!

It could be said that Elder Lin was the culprit who caused Ye Qingtang to be hunted down for her life by everyone in her previous life!

Her eyes blazed with hatred when she came face to face with her enemy, but Ye Qingtang was aware that she was not Elder Lin’s opponent right now. She could only hide away the coldness in her eyes, look down, and reply. “Yes, I witnessed the Blood Moon Sect Elder leaving. Senior Brother Zhou saw it as well.”

Then, Ye Qingtang looked at the Blood Moon Sect Elder who became Zhou Qu.

“Yes, I saw it as well,” said the Blood Moon Sect Elder calmly.

Elder Lin exchanged a look with Elder Qin.

The incident today was the only clue they found, and it resolved the mystery about the disappearance of the disciples. However, it had to do with the Blood Moon Sect… and it was by no means a trivial matter.

“It is good that everyone is safe. You all had a big shock. Once you all return to the sect, report everything you saw today in detail so it will be easier to organize the information.” Elder Qin comforted the frightened disciples. Being able to escape safely after encountering someone of a Blood Moon Sect Elder status was simply an unimaginable feat.

Xuanling Sect did not suffer many losses this time. Apart from the death of one person, other disciples were not injured. Rather, there were heavy casualties for other sects, and Wind Moon Sect even lost a highly-talented inner sect disciple.

At that thought, Elder Qin could not help but look at Ye Qingtang from aside. According to what Dai Changming said previously, a major reason that accounted for their small loss was that Ye Qingtang diverted the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s attention. Otherwise, not just Xuanling Sect disciples but even that last surviving teen from Wind Moon Sect would be buried here!

As early as during the sect assessment, Elder Qin had already thought rather highly of this new disciple, and now, he was even more satisfied.

Elder Lin noticed the look of approval in Elder Qin’s eyes as well, but there was no trace of a smile on his face. After glancing past Ye Qingtang, he frowned slightly. He could faintly feel a strange aura from Ye Qingtang’s body.

Ye Qingtang sensed Elder Lin’s gaze, and her heart skipped a beat. She looked down calmly, though her attention landed on the space ring on her finger.

The Revolving Soul Orb that the Blood Moon Sect Elder gave her just now was currently stored in the space ring. This space ring was of low quality and was simply unable to conceal the aura of the Revolving Soul Orb. Looking at Elder Lin’s reaction, she realized that he must have sensed something.
