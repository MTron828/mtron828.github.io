Chapter 2381: To Compete Or Not To Compete (3)

Ye Qingtang suddenly spoke up again. “You guys spent the whole afternoon with that kid from the Heaven Dome Academy?”

Momentarily taken aback, they paused for a moment before nodding in unison.

“Did he go anywhere during that period?”

The teenagers shook their heads.

“Xing Rong played chess with us the entire time. He didn’t leave for even a minute.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Realization dawned upon Ye Qingtang.

“I see.”

The brats had no idea why Ye Qing suddenly asked such a question but under the current circumstances, they didn’t dare to ask any questions. So they obediently returned to their accommodations to reflect on their behavior.

Ye Qingtang’s stern expression faded as she watched their departing profiles.

“A bunch of trouble-making brats…”

She had to leave after the Inter-Academy Competition so she didn’t have much time left to teach them. It was time for them to grow up. Not only did they have to improve their powers, but they also had to develop their minds and characters. Otherwise, it would be difficult for them to achieve great things.

Ye Qingtang sighed again before recalling something which Xing Rong casually mentioned. Bringing along those two spirit jades, she went looking for Wen Qi.

“Vice-President, were the details about the Inter-Academy Competition rule changes known even before today?” Ye Qingtang asked directly.

Wen Qi couldn’t help being taken aback by her question. He shook his head.

“No, the information is highly classified. We only knew that there would be some changes but had no idea about the details at all. Why did you ask about that?”

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly as Wen Qi’s words affirmed her suspicions.

Anxious from his defeat, Xing Rong inadvertently disclosed something. It seemed that Xing Rong had known that a teacher would lead this year’s team competitions.

But at that time, Ye Qingtang and the others had just returned from the briefing where the details were first announced. Xing Rong had been with Lei Yan and the rest the entire time and did not have any interaction with the Heaven Dome Academy teachers. So how did he know of this information?

Unless…

The only possibility was that he already knew of the details of the changes from before.

Although Ye Qingtang had initially suspected it, Wen Qi’s words only confirmed her conjecture.

So Ye Qingtang immediately told Wen Qi about Xing Rong and handed the two spirit jades to him.

“You are saying that the Heaven Dome Academy student already knew of the details of the rule change?” Wen Qi had no time to rejoice at the two new spirit jades. His face was grave.

Ye Qingtang nodded.

Wen Qi’s face darkened even further. If that was true, then there was something off about the entire situation.

Wu Fengling’s connections were not inferior to any of the other academies. Even so, he only managed to learn that there would be changes to rules and not the details.

But now, even a student from the Heaven Dome Academy knew of the details beforehand…

“Ye Qing, I will have someone investigate this matter. If the Heaven Dome Academy is the only one who had the early information, or that… our Netherworld Academy is the only one who didn’t know the details beforehand,” Wen Qi started.

If it was the former, things might not be that bad. If it was the latter…

Wen Qi could not ascertain the truth behind this matter for now. But it was not the most pressing issue at large.

“Ye Qing, let me handle this matter. On a related topic, I planned to wait till tomorrow to discuss something with you all, but it looks like the sooner the better. Go and gather the other teachers. We need to quickly decide on how to deal with this year’s Inter-Academy Competition.”
