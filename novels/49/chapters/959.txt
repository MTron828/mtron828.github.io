Chapter 960 Ye Family (4)

Second Elder had specially invited Dan Haoqing and Feng Qingyun to take command of the Ye Family, but they were only at the same level as Duan Tianyun-Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level One. However, they might be more experienced than Duan Tianyun.

However…

One must know that Duan Tianyun was not the only person in the Duan Family to have leveled up.

“The Long Family has a long history, and its Grand Elder is a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord. With a background like that, even if they gave the Duan Family a little help, it would be priceless to the Duan Family,” the Grand Elder said with a frown.

“Will the Duan Family really make trouble for us? Although they are usually arrogant, they are as obedient as young children in the presence of the Long Family.” Third Elder laughed coldly. He seemed rather disdainful of the way the Duan Family had acted.

All the great family clans had existed for centuries. Whether big or small, they maintained their dignity.

But not long after they met the Long Family, the Duan Family had shamelessly and repeatedly tried to curry the Long Family’s favor. Now, they had reaped the benefits and were throwing their weight around Lin Town. They no longer had any regard for the Ye Family or the Si Family.

With the help of the Long Family, the Duan Family had become increasingly arrogant.

“For the Long Family to have helped the Duan Family to suddenly create so many powerful cultivators above the level of Martial Qi Level One, the Duan Family must have expended a lot of effort to curry their favor,” said Second Elder with a sigh. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

As they were discussing the matter, Ye Ling entered the main hall with Ye Qingtang in tow.

The two new elders glanced at Ye Ling when he walked into the main hall, and their eyes fell on Ye Qingtang, who was walking behind Ye Ling.

They had been in the Ye Family for some time and had naturally been to Ye Ling’s study many times. Of course, they remembered the painting hanging in Ye Ling’s study.

Wasn’t the girl in the painting the same as the person behind Ye Ling?

The two of them had learned from the household guards that the Eldest Young Lady of the Ye Family, Ye Qingtang, had returned. They glanced at her and saw a beautiful young girl. Although she was astonishingly beautiful, her slightly immature features and frail body were no different from that of an ordinary girl.

“Master, is this the Eldest Young Lady?” Third Elder asked as he looked at Ye Qingtang, who was standing behind Ye Ling.

Ye Ling smiled and nodded. He said to Ye Qingtang, “Tang Tang, this is Third Elder, Feng Qingyun. This is the Great Elder, Dan Haoqing.”

“Greetings, Great Elder and Third Elder.” Ye Qingtang spoke politely.

The two elders nodded slightly. They did not pay much attention to the return of this Eldest Young Lady.

They had previously heard much about the Eldest Young Lady of the Ye Family. They knew that Ye Qingtang had entered the Xuanling Sect and became an outer sect disciple. However, this was nothing special and did not mean much to them.

An outer sect disciple of the Xuanling Sect would not be able to solve their current problems.

But at the mention of the sects, the Third Elder seemed to recall something. He turned and looked at the Great Elder. “Great Elder, do you know when your grandson will reach Lin Town?”

“Barring unforeseen circumstances, he will be here in two days,” replied the Great Elder.

The Duan Family had received much help from the Long Family in recent times, and the progress of the younger generation had been startling. Besides Duan Tianyun, who had progressed rapidly to the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level One, a few younger members of the Duan Family had also progressed very quickly.

A month ago, a younger member of the Duan Family had arrogantly gone to the Ye house to make trouble. This young member of the Duan Family’s natural talent was average, but with the help of the Long Family, he had rapidly progressed to the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level One.

That day, he had come to the Ye house and challenged all the younger members of the Ye Family. Even the disciples that the two elders had brought along had been defeated at his hands. He had then recklessly mocked the Ye Family for its lack of talent.
