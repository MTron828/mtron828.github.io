Chapter 834?Meticulous Thinking

Master Du was in deep thought after hearing that.

What Ye Qingtang said made sense.

It should be that the Peerless School found this place by coincidence but was unable to destroy the Diamond Rock and unwilling to give up. Hence, they sent a few outer sect disciples to guard this place every day to prevent outsiders from going near it.

“Brother Ye Chen’s thinking is meticulous. It seems that way to me as well. Let’s settle those three Peerless School disciples first and then enter the Dragon Vein,” Master Du said.

“There’s no hurry.”

Ye Qingtang shook her head. All of this was merely her conjecture. However, if there was a lapse in her conjecture such that the Peerless School had already demolished the Diamond Boulder and were inside the Dragon Vein right now, dealing with those three Peerless School disciples would definitely alarm the other powerful figures in the Dragon Vein, and the consequences would be disastrous. By then, neither of them needed to think of leaving the place alive.

Shock filled Master Du’s face after hearing Ye Qingtang, and he could not help but look at Ye Qingtang for a while more. “Brother Ye Chen, you are young, but your thinking is truly admirable.”

Then, Master Du decided to follow Ye Qingtang’s advice and remain calm.

“Those three Peerless School disciples guard this place every day, and will definitely make a mistake. We should be able to know whether the Diamond Boulder was destroyed from their mouths,” Ye Qingtang said with certainty.

Ye Qingtang and Master Du immediately kept their auras and walked forward.

They only stopped when they were less than 100 meters away from the three Peerless School disciples.

Ye Qingtang condensed the primordial qi in her body to the limits and maximized her hearing ability, seeming to wish to find out some information from the three people.

Until late night.

“Damn it. When will these days end? Why did the warden order us to guard this place every day?”

One of the Peerless School disciples complained angrily with indignation written all over his face.

Another Peerless School disciple scoffed after hearing that. “What is the point in complaining here? This is the warden’s decision. We are merely outer sect disciples of the Peerless School, and naturally, we are considered as cheap labor.”

“Be careful of what you say. If the warden knows what you all said, you would die ten times if you have ten lives!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Humph. There’s nobody here anyway. Moreover, so be it if the Diamond Boulder that blocked this Dragon Vein’s entrance is really destroyed. However, it has been so long, and the Diamond Boulder still remains there. It’s a dead end, and there’s simply no way to enter, but he still made us guard this place and kill anyone who comes near. Goddamn it, he seriously has nothing better to do.”

In the dark, Ye Qingtang’s lips tugged up slightly after hearing their conversation.

Master Du could not help but hold up his thumb at Ye Qingtang immediately. “Brother Ye Chen, you really predicted the events like a god. You even accurately guessed this…”

However, Ye Qingtang chuckled lightly. “They would definitely be resentful for guarding this place daily. Under these circumstances, complaining to each other is the best way of dealing with it.”

“I really could not tell. You’re so young but can actually think of things that ordinary people are unable to. Amazing.” Master Du laughed softly.

A while later, Master Du’s eyes flickered as he looked at those three Peerless School disciples in front, and he wanted to head forward.

However, at this critical juncture, Ye Qingtang grabbed the corner of Master Du’s clothes and pulled him back once again.

“Brother Ye Chen, what are you doing?” Master Du looked at Ye Qingtang with a confused expression.
