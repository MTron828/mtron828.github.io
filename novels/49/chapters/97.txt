Chapter 98: Path to Heaven (4)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

After some time, Ye Qingtang finally reached the end of the Path to Heaven.

At the top of the clouds shone a radiant light. A magnificent palace stood on the clouds. It had open pavilions and terraces and was shaded by surrounding trees. Facing against the sun, it was as though the holy light was shining from behind the sect.

If one did not witness it personally, they would be unable to imagine that the sect was actually positioned on top of the cloud layers.

No wonder ordinary people never knew where the sects were at.

One could know how scary the powerful people within the sect were to be able to build a sect on the clouds and bear thousands of disciples in it.

At the end of the Path to Heaven was Xuanling Sect’s main entrance where its gates, that were several meters high, were carved with huge dragons. Outside the gate, a middle-aged man in a light-blue long gown stood in front of the door with a few Xuanling Sect disciple behind him.

Ye Qingtang finished ascending the Path to Heaven and stepped on the clouds which seemed soft but were in fact extremely steady. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The middle-aged man looked up and took a look at Ye Qingtang’s face as surprise filled him.

The Path to Heaven was difficult to walk on, especially for people who stepped on it for the first time. There was nothing below their feet, and looking around, one would see that they were several hundred meters high in the sky. Just the scenery was enough to send those with an immature mind into a flurry. However, he observed from outside the sect door just now that this young girl was in the lead. Her steps were steady, and she had a casual demeanor. There was neither a trace of fluster nor nervousness.

Just this first impression satisfied the middle-aged man.

The disciple behind him walked forward, and before saying anything, Ye Qingtang consciously handed Mu Su’s letter over.

The middle-aged man took another look at Ye Qingtang and gave her a slight nod after receiving the letter, signaling for Ye Qingtang to stand aside.

Ye Qingtang was fast. A large group of people behind were still struggling in difficulty. A long time later, Yun Shu was the second person who finally reached the end. While he had a calm and steady nature, he still walked this path very cautiously without daring to increase his speed.

Along with Yun Shu’s arrival, Lu Xiuwen and other candidates ascended the Path to Heaven successively.

While more than a hundred of candidates came, Ye Qingtang estimated that only about a hundred people managed to ascend the Path to Heaven.

There were at least dozens of people filtered out by the Path to Heaven.

These dozens of people no longer had the chance to enter a sect. After looking at the color of the sky, the middle-aged man standing outside the sect gate waved his hand gently, and the holy light sprinkled on the clouds vanished instantly. Subsequently, the Path to Heaven which led the way to the sect disappeared without a trace.

The struggling people who were still halfway through were sent back to the ground by golden lotuses. Cries, screams, and begging filled the air immediately.

The path to the sect was now an extravagant wish.

Ye Qingtang did not have much reaction to it, as she had seen such scenes too many times.

“Many thanks.”

A voice rang beside Ye Qingtang suddenly. She looked over in confusion only to see Yun Shu, whose cheeks were slightly dotted with sweat, standing beside her since god knows when.

“Why are you thanking me?” Ye Qingtang raised her brows as she looked at her old friend from her previous life.

Yun Shu chuckled, “If Miss Ye didn’t take the first step just now, I would not have been able to understand the secret behind the Path to Heaven.” Moreover, Yun Shu purposely fixed his eyes on Ye Qingtang along the way in order to keep his mind at peace. Without looking at the scenery below his feet, his heart was naturally calmer.

For the people behind, it was indeed easier if someone took the lead. However, no one had ever said anything about it before the assessment. After all, they were all rivals on the land of the sect.

Ye Qingtang looked at Yun Shu with a seeming smile. When will this Senior Brother Yun finally be able to get rid of his habit of being a mighty nice person?
