Chapter 2480 - Kneel (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The big yellow dog, who had been squatting beside Ye Qingtang, tilted its head and wagged its tail. It yawned and looked at the General of the West Sea Tribe expressionlessly. “I say… you keep chattering non-stop. Are you done? On account of your ignorance, just kowtow to me and I’ll pretend that this never happened. I’ll spare your wretched lives then.”

Ye Qingtang glanced at the big yellow dog. It really knew how to talk. The odds were against her today. Ye Qingtang had racked her brains to think of a way to let the General of the West Sea Tribe and General Yongle fight first, but this dog…

After hearing what the big yellow dog said, a cold glint flashed across the eyes of the West Sea Tribe General. A dog wanted him to kneel down and apologize? So that it would spare his life?

“Haven’t I made myself clear, kid?” The yellow dog continued. “Kneel and show your gratitude. You’re a demon of this world and more or less related to Demon Emperor Yongle. So I don’t wish to kill you all.”

“It seems you have a death wish!”

Immediately, the West Sea Tribe General let out a furious roar. The mountains nearby shook from his roar.

“Alright, I guess you don’t know what’s good for you. You rather do this the hard way. In that case, I won’t spare you any more.”

The big yellow dog immediately looked at Ye Qingtang and wagged its tail. “Ancestor Qing, just use any divine ability you have to let these little fellows know what is called an insurmountable chasm.”

Ye Qingtang looked at the big yellow dog meaningfully. What exactly did this dog want to do…

Even if she used a killer move, the West Sea Tribe General probably wouldn’t even shed a single strand of hair. Wasn’t this dog deliberately throwing her into a fire pit?

“Don’t worry. Just use it. Why do you have so many opinions?” The big yellow dog muttered softly.

Ye Qingtang fell into deep thought.

In the Wailing Well, she had seen it with her own eyes. The big yellow dog had killed an above-Emperor level monster in one move… Although those above-Emperor level monsters were not on the same level as these demon generals, the big yellow dog might really have a way.

It was useless to say anything now. Ye Qingtang could only give it her all.

With that, Ye Qingtang waved her right arm lightly and a phoenix cry sounded in the air. In the next second, a flaming phoenix with crimson wings flapped its wings and let out a loud cry as it rapidly charged toward the General of the West Sea Tribe.

“What is that?!”

All the demons present stared at the fire phoenix in astonishment.

The demons here had never left this realm and did not know any martial art techniques or divine skills. The fire phoenix that Ye Qingtang used was a bloodline divine power and these demons had never seen such a thing before.

“You dare to utter such arrogant words with just a little trick like that?”

The West Sea Tribe General was surprised for a moment, but he quickly composed himself. Even though he didn’t know what it was, it didn’t pose any threat to him.

Ye Qingtang frowned deeply. She knew that it would definitely not work. After all, he was a general of the demon race and it was impossible for him to be easily intimidated by such a mystical ability.

“Kneel!”

Suddenly, the big yellow dog beside Ye Qingtang shouted angrily.

As the yellow dog spoke, Ye Qingtang executed her bloodline ability and the crimson gold fire phoenix’s body expanded to a few hundred feet in an instant.. Its eyes were like the eyes of the sky and there seemed to be terrifying flames from the asura abyss hidden within.
