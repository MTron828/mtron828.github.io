Chapter 1270: Unable to Enjoy (2)

Ye Qingtang had a breakdown on the inside but dared not show it. She even had the thought of dying as she looked at the plump, succulent Black Flame Worm.

How exactly should this be eaten?

Should she put it into her mouth directly? DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Looking at that fleshy Black Flame Worm that was still wriggling about, Ye Qingtang felt that she was still not mentally strong enough to reach that stage.

She could not eat it!

Ming Gu did not sense Ye Qingtang’s internal breakdown and obediently took out a dagger. Afterward, he sliced a piece of the Black Flame Worm’s gray flesh and handed it to Ye Qingtang.

Taking a look at the worm flesh that was still dripping with pus and then at the Black Flame Worm, which was trembling from the pain, Ye Qingtang’s heart was in crumbles.

What the heck! It’s really eaten raw?!

“Let’s eat it together.” Holding back the urge to puke, Ye Qingtang took the worm flesh, mustered her courage, and took a bite.

Fluid exploded in her mouth instantly with a bite. The disgusting taste of the carrion-like flesh rushed throughout her body.

God knows how much energy Ye Qingtang exerted to stop herself from puking.

In contrast, Ming Gu dug in blissfully after seeing that Ye Qingtang took a bite.

Humans and the Undead Clan had a world of differences in their taste for food.

As Ye Qingtang ate miserably, she realized that the heartless little white tiger was actually back-facing her and trembling continuously.

Don’t think that she doesn’t know it is suppressing its laughter!

With the thought of “all for one, one for all”, Ye Qingtang pulled the little white tiger over and stuffed a half-eaten piece of flesh into its mouth before it could react.

In just a moment, the little white tiger that had been gloating over her misfortune immediately rolled its eyes.

Does it still dare to be cocky?

Seeing that Ye Qingtang shared such a precious Black Flame Worm with that darn white tiger, Ming Gu’s eyes turned murderous.

The little white tiger was almost disgusted to death, yet it noticed that Ming Gu was glaring at it as though it wanted to devour it…

Fuck you!

It’s not like I ate it willingly!

“Ah Yao, is it tasty?” Ming Gu looked at Ye Qingtang obediently while secretly swearing to find a chance to kill this little white tiger that was fighting for her favor with him.

“How can something that you searched so hard for not be tasty?” Ye Qingtang smiled affectionately even though she was crying on the inside.

“Since it’s tasty, you should eat more.” As though he was greatly encouraged, Ming Gu could not even be bothered with eating and hurriedly began slicing pieces of worm flesh for Ye Qingtang.

That fleshy Black Flame Worm was cut into many pieces and was killed in the blink of an eye.

As Ye Qingtang pitied the Black Flame Worm, she pitied herself too.

When will this be over…

Just by looking at Ye Qingtang eat, Ming Gu was extremely content and specially slowed down his eating pace so as to leave more for Ye Qingtang.

“Ah Yao, how much longer are you going to stay like this?” Ming Gu asked suddenly

Ye Qingtang was slightly taken aback.

However, Ming Gu looked up, propped his chin on his hands, and watched Ye Qingtang eat the worm flesh.

“Ah Yao, previously, you said that it is easier for us to move around with a human appearance but… Ah Yao, humans are really too hideous. Ah Yao, you’re clearly so beautiful. Why must you force yourself to have this hideous look?” Ming Gu puckered his lips as regret filled his face.

Hi… deous?

Ye Qingtang stared blankly. “…”
