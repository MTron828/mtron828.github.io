Chapter 2389: Replacement (1)

Time passed day by day.

The Inter-Academy Competition progressed continuously and the top students from the various academies reigned over the matches, dominating intense battle after intense battle. Meanwhile, Lei Yan and his group didn’t set a single foot out of the North Hall. They spent every available second improving their cultivation.

This year’s Inter-Academy Competition was more intense than in previous years. It was said that during the finals of the martial arts competition, the sparring match to determine the number one student was so fierce that it nearly destroyed the entire Universe City.

In the end, the teenager who emerged victorious was someone completely unexpected.

It was not Xiao Yihan from the Sky Martial Academy nor was it Yin Kongluo from the Heaven Dome Academy. It was an unknown teenage girl from some second-tier academy.

It was said that this teenage girl was already at the Divine Lord Fourth level mid-stage. Meeting Yin Kongluo in the finals, she completely dominated Yin Kongluo…

This outcome was completely unexpected.

The individual martial arts competition finally came to an end after two weeks. Only two or three students from the Netherworld Academy managed to squeeze into the top 50. None of them were even close to the top 10.

One of the Netherworld Academy students fought to his last breath and managed to just enter the top 20. In the end, he had to be carried back to the North Hall.

“Pfft, useless garbage.” The teenagers returned, covered in injuries from their defeats. They glared at Lei Yan and the others, who did not participate in a single match, their eyes filled with disdain.

“Don’t come to the Inter-Academy Competition if you have no guts to fight. Taking up the slots for nothing. What a joke.”

“And they are Divine Lord stage… what a bunch of spineless deserters!”

Those harsh insults barraged the ears of Lei Yan and his group endlessly.

Actually, right after Qiu Nan left, Qin Feng and his team already felt that something was not quite right. They did not question the reason behind Qiu Nan’s departure. Now and then when they bumped into Qiu Nan, he would just circle around them and act as if he didn’t know them at all.

At first, Lei Yan was rather pissed off at the snubbing. After all, Ye Qing had treated Qiu Nan no different from the rest of them while he was under him. Their teacher had taught him quite a number of cultivation techniques, but he had just turned and left. And he was now behaving as if they were in the wrong.

Luckily Qin Feng had held Lei Yan back, otherwise, there might have been a scuffle. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Even so, it was clear that their team had become like alley rats in the eyes of the other Netherworld Academy folks. They all glared at them with eyes filled with rage.

Gong Jinyun and Hang Wenwei’s teachers had also sought them out to persuade them to return, just like what Qiu Nan’s teacher had done. But they rejected their teachers’ offers.

They decided to stay until the Inter-Academy Competition ended. Seeing this, Lei Yan was so touched that he wanted to become sworn brothers with those two.

Very soon, Yun Chen’s alchemy competition started. Compared to other competitions, the alchemy competition was much simpler and more straightforward.

In just one day, the entirety of the competition was completed with the results announced as well.

After the consecutive defeats suffered by the Netherworld Academy earlier, they finally had students who successfully entered the top 10.

Yun Chen and Song Yanhan were both in the top 10 of the alchemy competition. Song Yanhan was ranked eighth while Yun Chen managed to garner fifth place.

Everyone knew that Song Yanhan was Zhu Ning’s personal disciple, while Zhu Ning was the teacher who produced that Grand Master alchemist. As a result, no one was surprised at Song Yanhan’s results.
