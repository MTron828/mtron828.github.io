Chapter 322: The Top of the Outer Sect (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Everyone at the square looked at Ye Qingtang in a complex way.

No one could imagine that such an insignificant disciple would make the top on the Honor Roll List, Ji Xianyuan, get so serious.

Elder Huang’s concern had become a strange feeling. He could not describe how he felt now as he stared at Ye Qingtang. He even had some expectations now.

Other disciples might not notice during the fight, but Elder Huang had seen everything clearly. Ji Xianyuan did not hold back at all. Every single move was ferocious. However, Ye Qingtang could fend off all of them and even took the chance to attack. It was hard to tell who was stronger now.

No one expected that she could fight with the top disciple of the outer sect until now.

Only until now did Elder Huang then understand why Ye Qingtang had the courage to challenge Ji Xianyuan.

“I was wrong this time.” Elder Huang sighed. Based on Ye Qingtang’s moves just now, he was astonished by her ability. Even if she lost in the end, it would still be an honor.

She would be another strong candidate in the inner sect assessment this year.

Ji Xianyuan took a light breath and stared at Ye Qingtang. “It’s an honor to have a battle with you, Junior Sister Ye.”

The moment when he finished his sentence, he pulled out his sword. A streak of cold light appeared beside him as he dashed forward.

Ye Qingtang smiled. She did not back off, and instead, she raised her sword and was ready to fight.

The light of the sword sparkled on the arena instantly. Only two shadows could be seen. They moved so fast that many disciples were dazzled.

Everyone’s sight was captured by the two people on the arena.

Ye Qingtang is insane to be able to fight against the top person of the outer sect. She… She is a monster!

How long has she entered the sect for!

Ji Xianyuan is at the peak of Connate Level Nine!

Ji Xianyuan’s state was entirely different from before. His sight was very sharp. As he split his sword down, the sword breath filled the whole arena. It seemed to create a violent gust of wind.

Ye Qingtang’s body changed into a virtual and blurry figure. She took a lap, and her hair was flying under the wind. Her sword was dyed gold by the sunlight, and she pierced the sword directly at Ji Xianyuan.

The sound of the swords colliding, and the shadows of the swords sparkling were everywhere in the arena.

Lin Feng stared at this intense battle unbelievably. His eyes were full of surprise.

He clearly knew how strong was Ji Xianyuan after experiencing a battle with him. That was the reason why Lin Feng could not believe that there was anyone in the outer sect that was able to fight against Lin Feng!

Ye Qingtang… What was her background?!

Lin Feng did not even hear of this name before the inner sect assessment. However, Ye Qingtang was engaged in an intense battle with Ji Xianyuan when Lin Feng himself could not even compete with him.

Even Dai Changming, who was in the same mission with Ye Qingtang before, was shocked by the battle.

He was so nervous when Ye Qingtang stepped onto the arena.

However…

The nervousness was long gone, and his whole body was filled with astonishment.
