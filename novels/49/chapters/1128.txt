Chapter 1129: Kill Her (1)

Looking at the demonic creature which chased up to them, Ye Qingtang calmed herself down and asked,

“I’m curious as to how you broke the Realistic Illusion so quickly…”

The demonic creature was inches away from them now, and it was unrealistic for them to escape from Wind Cloud City. Since there was no way out, they could only fight with their lives.

“Someone… wants your life… Who did you offend… Are you… not aware…” The demonic creature glared at Ye Qingtang and said coldly.

“Someone wants my life…”

Ye Qingtang was stunned by what the demonic creature had said. What did it mean?

“Die!!”

The demonic creature roared. A wild wind was raked up, and a frightening demonic aura enshrouded the entire city.

Swoosh!

Ye Qingtang would not wait for her death. She activated the power of her Divine Phoenix Bloodline to the maximum and slashed her sword at the demonic creature.

However, that scarlet sword gleam with incredible destructive force only left a negligible scratch on that demonic creature’s huge body.

“Perfect defense?!”

Ye Qingtang was taken aback when she saw that the demonic creature was completely unharmed.

This human-looking demonic creature’s skin was like hard metal that simply could not be penetrated or destroyed.

The demonic creature’s perfect defense was unrelated to its cultivation realm and seemed to be a natural gift…

Before Ye Qingtang could think further, the demonic creature threw a punch out at the speed of lightning.

Almost instinctively, Ye Qingtang used her sword to block the blow.

Boom!

It was like a thunderous explosion. Ye Qingtang was flung hundreds of meters away by the blow, shattering several buildings in Wind Cloud City.

“Roar!”

The little white tiger roared furiously and charged towards the demonic creature.

However, before it could get close, it was also hurled away by the demonic creature’s punch.

“F*ck… So damn painful!” The little white tiger complained incessantly after landing on the ground, but it seemed to recall something and immediately stood up.

“Eh… It isn’t that painful… My defense became stronger…”

“Holy Lady!”

The Blood Moon Elder flew to Ye Qingtang’s side hurriedly and helped her up.

Whatever weird species that this demonic creature was, its strength and defense was close to perfect and was unrestricted by the martial realm. Even though it was in this mainland, its strength and defense were on par with an Arcane Supremacy and simply could not be fought against!

Ye Qingtang’s face was pale, and blood seeped out from the corners of her lips. She frowned and grunted at the Blood Moon Elder. “Quick… flee…”

This demonic creature was too powerful, and even she was not its opponent. If Blood Moon Elder did not flee now, he would definitely die.

“Holy Lady! What are you saying! How can I abandon you and flee for my life at this time!” Blood Moon Elder shook his head repeatedly.

Blood Moon Elder had interacted with Ye Qingtang daily for more than one year, and they had been through so many things together. Their relationship was already beyond the restrictions of life and death. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The Blood Moon Elder clenched his teeth. Even at this critical moment where their lives and deaths were concerned, Ye Qingtang only wanted him to escape quickly…

“All… must die!”

The demonic creature roared in fury, and a huge fist was thrown powerfully toward Ye Qingtang.

However, before the demonic creature could act, a shadow flashed across the air.

Boom, boom!!

All of a sudden, a blaring sound exploded in the air.
