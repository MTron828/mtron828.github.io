Chapter 541 War (1)

At that moment, Soul Severing Troll walked forward and gently lifted and placed Ye Qingtang on his shoulder.

Ye Qingtang stood on the shoulder of the giant-like troll proudly and gave her order immediately. “This place must be bloodstained!”

A cold and cheerless voice traveled into everyone’s ears. In the next second…

“Kall!”

“Kall!”

“Kall!”

Hundreds of Blood Moon Sect members shouted continuously. “Kall!”

Ye Qingtang waved a hand immediately.

Swoosh!

In almost a second, hundreds of Blood Moon Sect members turned into blood-colored shadows and flew towards Xuanling Sect. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

While the Yunxiao Sect disciples were powerful, they paled in comparison to the Blood Moon Sect members. Moreover, more than half of the Yunxiao Sect disciples sent were already killed by Xuanling Sect’s heritage, and only around thirty people remained, making it impossible to put up a struggle against hundreds of Blood Moon Sect members.

At that instant, the Yunxiao Sect disciples in Xuanling Sect were no longer as arrogant and proud as before. With the Blood Moon Sect members coming after their lives crazily, the Yunxiao Sect disciples fled in disarray.

The Xuanling Sect disciples were dumbfounded at the sight and did not know what to say.

They were initially a little worried that the Blood Moon Sect people would conveniently kill them along with the Yunxiao Sect forces…

After all, while that Shuo Tianzang said he wanted to protect Xuanling Sect, according to Blood Moon Sect’s past temperamental style, it was impossible to make any judgments. However, this worry vanished into thin air very quickly. The Blood Moon Sect members did not attack Xuanling Sect. Their objective was very clear, and they only targeted Yunxiao Sect such that they did not even spare Xuanling Sect an eye.

The Xuanling Sect masses were even more bafHled then. They initially thought that a disaster would befall on them, yet unexpectedly, the Blood Moon Sect appeared in the middle of nowhere.

Li Chenfeng’s brows were tightly furrowed. The Blood Moon Guardian actually gave an order to annihilate them…

“Little b*tch, receive your death!”

Blood Demon cackled before turning into blood water and headed towards Ye You directly.

Noticing the situation, Ye You’s eyes were cold, and a horrifying breath of destruction emerged around her.

Blood Demon possessed demonic blood powers, and he could disjoin himself and turn into blood water. However, Ye You never paid any attention to him. With her blue spirit root and Paragon Skill, she could kill the Blood Demon if she was given time.

“Blood Moon Guardian, is it impossible to end things nicely today?” Li Chenfeng looked at Ye Qingtang.

However, Ye Qingtang remained silent and looked back at Li Chenfeng with cold eyes, clearly having no intention to reply to him.

“Good… Since your Blood Moon Sect is so conceited, all of you will die here today.” Li Chenfeng narrowed his eyes. He originally did not wish to fight against Blood Moon Sect, yet unexpectedly, the Blood Moon Sect wanted to annihilate them. If that was the case, a war it shall be then!

Right after, Li Chenfeng gently patted the sect protector divine beast.

“Roar!”

In the next second, the divine beast roared in fury and charged towards Ye Qingtang.

“Roar!”

At the same time, the eight demonic beasts roared angrily and charged out from both Ye Qingtang’s sides. Several huge shadows flashed across and entered a brawl with that divine beast!

Swoosh!

A sword light shone and slashed towards Li Chenfeng.

Li Chenfeng did not dare to be careless and used a remarkable technique to take refuge in the void, only reappearing after dodging that frightening blow.

“Shuo Tianzang…”

Li Chenfeng mumbled coldly as he looked at the youth who stood in midair with a sword wielded in his hand.

Shuo Tianzang was highly-ranked amongst the one hundred and eight Branch Masters. His Sword Dao attainments were extremely high, and he was not easy to deal with.
