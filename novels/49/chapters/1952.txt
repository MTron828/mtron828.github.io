Chapter 1953: Old Acquaintance (3)

Even the eyes of the Ancient You Clan’s warden widened in shock at the sight of that carriage.

The elder had chosen to let him out?

“This is the intention of the elder?” The warden looked at the sentry in front of the carriage.

The guard nodded quietly.

For a moment, the warden looked rather conflicted.

Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes at the sight of that horse carriage. Those three youths had already given Ming Di a good challenge. Who knew what kind of horrific power the Ancient You Clan was unleashing now?

Upon closer inspection, Ye Qingtang also noticed that the design of the carriage was rather strange. Although it looked like a horse carriage, it also looked like a mobile prison. The chains binding the carriage were carved with all sorts of strange-looking scriptures.

It was almost as if they were trying to suppress something.

The Ancient You Clan warden hesitated a moment longer before finally nodding his head. The carriage came to a stop at the entrance of the canyon, directly facing Ming Di.

Ming Di narrowed its eyes at the carriage. It could already feel that the aura radiating from that carriage was completely different from those earlier youths.

This aura was oppressiveーsuffocatingly powerful.

With a loud crash, the chains binding the horse carriage broke. The thick chains started to fall onto the floor, and a dense smog seeped out of the cracks in the carriage.

The smog permeated the air, drawing up layers of dirt from the ground. It surged toward the crowd with tremendous impact.

“What the hell is in that horse carriage?” As the smog engulfed them, one of the ancient clan leaders felt like his blood had nearly hardened from the oppressive aura.

“What’s there to be afraid of? We have Ming Di and the Holy Lord of Shadows on our side. We can handle any monster the Ancient You Clan sets upon us.” Quite a number of them had the utmost faith in the Holy Lord’s powers—even though it was blind faith.

Ye Qingtang was speechless after hearing those words. Indeed if she was the true Holy Lord of Shadows, there wasn’t anything to be afraid of.

But she wasn’t...

A Paragon level practitioner might be considered great in Central Mainland. But with Little You Yun’s Spiritual Abode, Ye Qingtang had no way of guessing just how powerful the Ancient You Clan had become.

This encounter would be a direct way to test just how powerful the Ancient You Clan had grown.

Clink. The final chain binding the carriage soon fell to the ground.

Everyone was holding their breath in apprehension. They stared unwaveringly at the carriage for any signs of movement.

The horse carriage remained completely still. The person inside didn’t emit a single sound.

Ming Di narrowed his eyes dangerously. Faced with this powerful practitioner, his dragon scales had taken on a subtle blood-red sheen. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Boom!”

Before anyone could see what had happened, a slim figure suddenly burst out of the carriage and charged ferociously toward Ming Di.

In the blink of an eye, Ming Di and that black figure were already engaged in a great scuffle. Loud booms echoed through the air as both sides moved at lightning speed. No one at present could even see what was happening.

Surrounding cliffs started to crack and shattered rocks flew everywhere. As the sides of the canyon kept absorbing wave after wave of impactful blows, countless pieces of shattered rocks tumbled all over.

The earth beneath everyone’s feet seemed about to rupture anytime to the point that long, jagged cracks had already appeared.
