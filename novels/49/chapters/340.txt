Chapter 341: The Paragon Skill (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Song Junqiu immediately took out ten bottles of his own Soul Condensation Pills and placed them on the table. It seemed as if Feng Moli’s hand would land on his head if he were to delay it for any longer.

Song Junqiu never imagined that he would provoke Feng Moli when he only wanted to give Ye Qingtang a lesson. He lost his reputation and had to compensate ten bottles of Soul Condensation Pills.

He had to hold all his complaints.

Feng Moli lifted his eyebrows as he saw the ten bottles of Soul Condensation Pills on the table. He then looked towards Ye Qingtang. “Now you know who’s stronger?”

Ye Qingtang was amused by Feng Moli’s arrogant face. Her face remained serious, and she said, “I shall thank you first for looking after me in future, Senior Brother Feng!”

Without the Paragon Skill, Feng Moli’s ability might not be the strongest in the inner sect, but still, no one could compare with his talent. People like Song Junqiu were not even qualified to fight with Feng Moli.

Feng Moli felt satisfied and provoked Song Junqiu. “This person’s Soul Condensation Pills will be mine in future. If I see you again, you should know the consequences.”

Song Junqiu did not dare to explain to Feng Moli anymore. He could only nod his head heavily and said, “Of course, Junior Brother Feng. I have something on, and I shall leave first.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He then escaped the place confoundedly with the other disciples.

Feng Moli dispersed the flame around his body after Song Junqiu left. The temperature in the surroundings returned to normal conditions.

“I had to waste my energy and time to talk to him. The extra Soul Condensation Pills will serve as compensation for your terrible observation. What a joke to compare the useless Song Junqiu with me!”

Feng Moli took all the ten bottles of Soul Condensation Pills that Song Junqiu left and placed them into his space ring.

Fei Ying was confused. He thought that Feng Moli was kind as he challenged Song Junqiu. However…

He was more relentless.

He took all the ten bottles of the Soul Condensation Pills?!

Ye Qingtang did not show any detestation against Feng Moli. She smiled and said, “Of course, they should be the compensation for my ignorance.”

Feng Moli glanced at Ye Qingtang.

“At least you understand the situation.”

Though he got what he wanted from other new disciples just now, those people’s reactions were not as obedient as those from Junior Sister Ye here.

“Remember, three bottles of Soul Condensation Pills every month.” Feng Moli withdrew his sight and left the sentence before he wandered out of the yard.

After Feng Moli disappeared from the yard, Fei Ying finally opened his mouth and spoke.

“Young Lady, both of them are bullying us! I thought that Feng Moli is a good guy. Who knew that he was worse? He took all the ten bottles of Soul Condensation Pills!” Fei Ying’s eyes were red as Feng Moli was even more aggressive than Song Junqiu.

Ye Qingtang smiled at Fei Ying’s angry face. She could make the connection between the little guy who could not even hide his thoughts with the killer who murdered disciples of the same sect.

“Just let him take them. Anyway, the Soul Condensation Pills were not mine. How come you are angry when I’m completely fine?” Ye Qingtang made fun of Fei Ying and said.
