Chapter 2012: Relentless (4)

You Qiong spoke carefully as he looked at Elder Mo’s expression. Those words were what Ye Qingtang had asked him to reveal to Elder Mo. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

By now, Elder Mo’s expression was extremely bleak. He had heard that the Crimson League had relations with the Temple of Shadows but thought that those had broken off when the Holy Lord of Shadows went missing.

Which was why they had never included the Crimson League in their calculations.

However...

Did this mean that the Temple of Shadows was returning to the Crimson League? This was extremely possible considering all that had happened so far.

Why would the Crimson League send people over from the Second Domain if not for the fact that the Temple of Shadows had gone to them for help after feeling threatened?

“The Holy Lord of Shadows is intelligent indeed. No wonder she had dared to retaliate against us that time. So she had already contacted the Crimson League...” Elder Mo laughed coldly.

“They’re just using the authenticity of the Netherworld Ring as an excuse to start a fight with us.”

He took a deep breath and looked at the pathetic You Qiong.

“You can go and take a rest first. I will inform the Clan Leader.”

They could sort out any misunderstandings if those were present but there was nothing to speak about if the Crimson League had been on the side of the Temple of Shadows from the start.

A cold smile flashed across You Qiong’s face as he looked at Elder Mo rush off.

...

In the Temple of Shadows, Ye Qingtang who had already planned everything out was about to check up on the Ancient Clans. But before she could step out of the door, a voice sounded behind her.

“Mo Yao, wait.”

Her footsteps halted. The voice was ethereal and she knew who it was even before turning around.

She turned around and found the black-robed ambassador behind her.

“Mi? What is it?” she asked as she looked at him. He was from the Ghost Clan and was called Mi.

The Ghost Clan was vastly different from the dead souls of ordinary people. They were born without a body and were just formless consciousness. With the continuous cultivation of the Ghost Clan, they were able to control the energy of the dead and create a vague body.

They were beings that had never been alive.

If the Undead Clan was the clan closest to death, then the Ghost Clan could be said to be born from death itself.

“Mo Yao, is there anything you haven’t told us?” Mi’s entire body was hidden under the black cloak with only a stream of black smoke coming out from it.

“What are you talking about?” she asked.

“The Spirit of Chaos,” Mi said.

Ye Qingtang was taken aback.

He continued, “Since the Temple of Shadows has rejoined the Crimson League, we have decided to interfere in the matters of the Central Mainland. But since the Netherworld Ring has already been lost, the League Chief has requested that you collect all the fragments of the Spirit of Chaos.”

She hadn’t expected the Crimson League to want the Spirit of Chaos so quickly.

While she wasn’t sure what exactly it was, she knew that it had to be powerful since the Ancient You Clan was going through so much trouble to obtain it. And now even the Crimson League was coveting it...

“I understand the League Chief’s intentions. Once everything has been settled on the Central Mainland, I will hand over all the fragments that I have collected,” she said with a smile.
