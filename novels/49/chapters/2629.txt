Chapter 2630 Han Cangming’s Ambush

An Immortal Emperor’s body would be filled with treasures, so if he died, his corpse would be a treasure trove. To Emperor-level practitioners, it was extremely attractive. Even if it was risky, as long as there was the hope of obtaining this treasure trove, they would do their best to fight for it.

Clearly, the Emperor level experts who had been hiding in the dark believed that the Heavenly Emperor would not be able to endure the 10th Heavenly Tribulation. Perhaps he had already died. This would be the best opportunity for them to raid the Heavenly Emperor.

Ye Qingtang’s body streaked across the sky and she turned into a white shadow. In the blink of an eye, she had already disappeared.

About 15 minutes later, in an open canyon deep in the forest. Thick smoke was rising into the sky, accompanied by strange sizzling sounds.

There was a huge depression below, about a hundred feet in diameter. The Heavenly Emperor was lying in it.

Ye Qingtang was the first to arrive. She frowned when she saw the Heavenly Emperor in the deep pit in the valley.

After a while, Ye Qingtang landed on the ground. She was not bothered by the approaching auras.

Upon landing, Ye Qingtang walked to the side of the deep pit and her gaze landed on the motionless Heavenly Emperor, whose body was still emitting white smoke. It had to be said that this scene felt very familiar.

Ye Qingtang still remembered that when she first met the Blood Moon Holy Lord on the First Mainland of the Blue Sky Domain, it was very similar to what she was seeing now. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

It seemed that history liked to repeat itself.

Ye Qingtang did not rashly approach the Heavenly Emperor but observed from the side. She did not know how badly injured the Heavenly Emperor was. If she approached him just like that, she might be attacked. She did not want to take such a huge and meaningless risk.

Before long, several figures flickered in the air as the Emperor-level experts arrived. The Emperor level practitioners were stunned to see a woman standing near the Heavenly Emperor.

They did not expect someone to be even faster than them and arrive before them.

“Who are you? Are you here to raid the Immortal Emperor?” One of the practitioners asked as his gaze landed on Ye Qingtang.

These Emperor-level practitioners did not know Ye Qingtang and did not know her background, so they were rather cautious.

Ye Qingtang looked up at the Emperor-level figures and said, “The Heavenly Emperor has not died yet. There’s no need to talk about raiding. Leave immediately.”

The Emperor-level practitioners were stunned. This woman of unknown origin was young, but her tone was bold. To think that she was commanding the Emperor-level figures to leave immediately.

“Why? Do you want to keep the corpse of the Immortal Emperor for yourself?!” One of the Emperor-level experts glared at Ye Qingtang and shouted coldly.

“Was I not clear enough?” Ye Qingtang frowned slightly. “Didn’t I say just now that the Heavenly Emperor is not dead?”

“Hmph, whether he is dead or alive is not for you to say. Even if he is still alive, he is heavily injured and will die sooner or later. You’re still young, why don’t you leave now and avoid an unnecessary calamity?” The leading Emperor-level figure said coldly.

If they could obtain the treasures of this Immortal Emperor, there was a high chance that one of them could become a new Immortal Emperor.
