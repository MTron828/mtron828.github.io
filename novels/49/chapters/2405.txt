Chapter 2406: Tragic (3)

Without wasting another second, Ye Qingtang immediately went over to Lu Yuanxiang and crouched down beside him. Taking out some elixirs from her space ring, she gave them to Lu Yuanxiang.

Lu Yuanxiang looked at the elixirs that Ye Qing was offering him. There was a conflicted expression on his face.

Like many other Netherworld Academy teachers, he had never acknowledged Ye Qing as one of them. He had no clear lineage and was too young. In addition, he had forced Di Nuo to leave…

Lu Yuanxiang had not been as outwardly hostile as the other teachers, but he also never stood on Ye Qing’s side.

Who would have thought…

He had to accept his help today.

“Thank you…” Helpless, Lu Yuanxiang thanked him before consuming the elixirs.

Shortly after, Ye Qing retrieved a large stash of elixirs and tossed them at Yun Chen and the others.

“Give these out to the others.”

Yun Chen and the rest immediately doled out the elixirs to the teenagers in Lu Yuanxiang’s team. The exhausted teenagers heaved a sigh of relief after consuming the elixirs.

“This is for nourishing the blood, this is for readjusting your energy flow, this is… just take them all for now.” Lei Yan grabbed a bunch of pills and shoved them into the mouth of the teenager in front of him.

The teenager was stunned.

It should be pointed out that no one was allowed to bring any elixirs into this competition. After entering the Wailing Well, elixirs had become the most precious life-preserving tools. For their team, they only consumed their elixirs under the most desperate circumstances.

Even so, their supply of elixirs had nearly run out.

But…

Lei Yan and the others were sharing their elixirs as if they were on freeflow. Shoving handfuls of them into their mouths. All sorts of elixirs, just to be safe and help them recover.

“Did you… did you guys secretly sneak in elixirs?” One of the teenagers asked in a low voice.

Lei Yan was taken aback.

“Who would dare to? We would have been automatically disqualified. We refined all of these inside the Wailing Well. Don’t worry, it’s completely in line with the rules.”

The youth was even more shocked, and the other teenagers looked equally stunned.

So many elixirs?

Just the act of foraging for enough herbs to refine so many elixirs would take up a large amount of time. Not to mention the process of refining them.

What had they been doing inside the Wailing Well?

Had they just been refining elixirs and doing nothing else…

Yun Chen and Song Yanhan were both from the medicine faculty and knew the basics of medical treatment. They started to treat the wounds of those teenagers. Meanwhile, Ye Qingtang tended to Lu Yuanxiang, who had suffered the most serious injuries.

Even Lu Yuanxiang didn’t expect Ye Qing to have so many elixirs. If not for Lei Yan’s answer, he would have also suspected that he had snuck them in from outside.

“Teacher Ye.” Lu Yuanxiang’s voice was raspy. He looked at Ye Qing, who was busy treating his injuries.

“Don’t speak. Your injuries are very grave and you will die if I don’t tend to them now,” Ye Qing said.

Lu Yuanxiang moved his lips again but he remained silent. Instead, the eyes of the teenagers from his team reddened after hearing Ye Qing’s words. Disregarding their own wounds, they ran over.

“Teacher Ye, please save our teacher! We beg you!”

“Please, you must save him!”

Ye Qingtang didn’t speak. Lu Yuanxiang’s injuries were even more serious than she imagined. Not only was his skin and flesh ripped open, but there were also deep purple spots scattered across his wounds.

He had been poisoned. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Ye Qingtang had seen quite a number of demons inside the Wailing Well but had never encountered one that was venomous.

As she pondered over this, she carved off the rotten flesh, applied more medicine, before slowly sewing up the gaping wound.
