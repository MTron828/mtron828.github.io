Chapter 538 Displaying One’s Remarkable Prowess (1)

Clank!

As a crisp unsheathing sound rang in the air, that disrespectful Yunxiao Sect warden was split into two by the blood-colored sword light in the next second.

Clank!

At the same time, the sword was kept back into its sheath. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“On the basis of my sword.”

Shuo Tianzang was emotionless.

“Hiss!”

As the Yunxiao Sect elites saw crimson blood spurting out of the warden who was sliced by the sword aura, they gasped in horror.

No one saw Shuo Tianzang’s attack. That man in a white top seemed to have stood in midair without moving throughout the entire time. The sword was unsheathed and sheathed in just a breath’s time, and it was so quick that one could not distinguish his movements with their naked eye…

In just a moment, the Yunxiao Sect warden was killed there and then.

“Shuo Tianzang ”

A Yunxiao Sect elder was rather nervous.

Rumor had it that amongst the one hundred and eight Branch Masters, Shuo Tianzang was nicknamed the Blood Moon Fiend Sword. His swordplay techniques were superb and had been extraordinary since a thousand years ago. He was known as Blood Moon Sect’s top swordplay master. Although he was a Branch Master, his skills were, however, unfathomable…

“That Nine-Tailed Spirit Phoenix is pretty good.”

Suddenly, an ethereal voice sounded from the blood-colored carriage that the eight demonic beasts were pulling.

Blood Demon immediately cupped his fists and bowed respectfully. “I understand.”

Afterward, Blood Demon snickered devilishly and flew towards Ye You.

Ye You was slightly taken aback to see a red shadow flying towards her. A cold glint flickered in her eyes as she said coldly, “You have a death wish.”

Ye You, who was standing on the Nine-Tailed Spirit Phoenix, smashed a hand towards Blood Demon.

A playful expression appeared on Blood Demon’s face immediately. There was something special about this Yunxiao Sect girl. She was so young but had already entered the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three.

Blood Demon rapidly disjointed his body and turned into blood water.

“Blood Demon Mystical Technique…”

Ye You kept her hand back. A blue light filled with a horrifying force of destruction floated into appearance around her.

“Tsk tsk…” Blood Demon laughed evilly. Even if she had a blue spirit root, he had no fear.

Before Ye You attacked, the Nine-Tailed Spirit Phoenix beneath her was already covered in Blood Demon’s blood-colored force.

The Nine-Tailed Spirit Phoenix cried in fury and moved around, wanting to escape the bind.

However, the blood-colored force was like a sturdy cage that could not be escaped from.

Blood Demon pulled the Nine-Tailed Spirit Phoenix and flew forward.

Ye You frowned. She could not do anything to Blood Demon right now. If she was led into the group of people by him, the consequences would be dire, so she could only give up on her Nine-Tailed Spirit Phoenix temporarily.

At the thought of how she had never suffered such a humiliation ever since she entered Yunxiao Sect, she glared at the blood-colored carriage coldly.

Pulling the Nine-Tailed Spirit Phoenix, Blood Demon walked to the blood carriage in great strides before kneeling on a knee. “I’ve brought the Nine-Tailed Spirit Phoenix!”

“Good.”

The ethereal voice sounded from the carriage once again.

As that voice sounded, an ash-pale girl with a crystal clear body and delicate features slowly walked out from the blood carriage with an aloof expression. She reached out for the Nine-Tailed Spirit Phoenix. Her seemingly weak hand was gently placed on the back of the Nine-Tailed Spirit Phoenix.

“Hoot!”

The Nine-Tailed Spirit Phoenix shouted angrily, as though it did not allow anyone apart from Ye You to touch it.

However…

As the girl’s hand touched the Nine-Tailed Spirit Phoenix, it turned blood-red before everyone’s eyes and no longer struggled in just a few breaths’ time.

“Blood Demon.” The girl spoke softly.

Then, Blood Demon let out an evil laugh and kept the blood-colored force that twined around the Nine-Tailed Spirit Phoenix’s body.
