Chapter 2015: The Demon Clan Disaster (3)

The youths who had been changed by little You Yun’s Spiritual Abode.

She had thought that the cause was little You Yun’s Spiritual Abode all this while but now that she thought about it... even though everyone in the Ancient You Clan had gotten much more powerful, the ones who had become monstrously strong were mainly the youths...

She clearly remembered how their irises would change as they became their most powerful...

What did this have to do with all those missing cubs?

“Are the people from the Ancient You Clan taking part in the attacks on the demon tribes?” she asked.

“As far as I know, they were not participating and didn’t care about the demon tribes at all. They just let the tribes under them attack and invade the tribes. But recently there has been a greater sense of urgency in their attacks and they have gotten the demon tribes following them and even the Eternal Dynasty to join the invasion,” You Qiong said.

Even the Eternal Dynasty was participating?

Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes. She had already gotten the Sacred Martial Academy to repay their debt to her. All that was left was the Eternal Dynasty...

“I understand. Continue observing the Ancient You Clan and report to me if anything happens.”

“Yes.”

She ended their connection and a smile pulled at the corners of her lips.

This would be easy since the Ancient You Clan had sent people to help with the invasion.

After she gathered the eight tribe leaders and Ming Di, as well as the Northstar Demon Lord on the way, the entourage headed towards Northland to kill them.

...

The Northland was covered in snow. But the once vast white landscape was now dotted with stark red blood. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Countless bodies were half-buried in the white snow. The land was dyed red in the demons’ blood. Human soldiers came in troops on horses with the demon tribes on their side, disrupting the peace of the Northland.

“I can see a group of demons from the Northland Demon Tribe heading that way.” A lizard-like demon pointed at a snow-capped mountain as he narrowed his slit eyes and his forked tongue darted from his lips.

Behind the demon was a huge troop of human soldiers. They rode on huge horses with huge carts among them full of cold metal cages.

The cages were stuffed full of scared, trembling demon cubs.

They were all extremely small and were in the form they were born with as they didn’t know how to shape-shift yet. They had just witnessed their parents being killed cruelly in front of them before being dragged from their corpses and thrown into these cold cages.

The naive cubs could only wail in fear as they cuddled together, trying to get warm.

“Shut your traps. Keep wailing and I’ll kill all of you.” An Eternal Dynasty soldier slammed his heavy sword upon the cages harshly as he glared at them with fierce eyes.

The terrified cubs huddled even closer together as they stared at the evil demons in front of them with tears in their eyes.

“Ignore them. Go after the escaping ones at once,” the lizard-like demon spat out.

The Eternal Dynasty soldier’s lips twitched as he reached into the cage nonchalantly and grabbed one of the demon’s feet. He pulled it through the bars of the cage as the demon cut wailed in pain.

“They’re too noisy.”
