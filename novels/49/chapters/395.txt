Chapter 396: Give A Try (4)

The blacksmiths were stunned when they heard what the incharge just said.

Was the incharge mad?

He wanted a young girl to take over the task of forging the Remnant Ice Sword?

Ye Qingtang was also shocked by his request.

“Little girl, I know that you are talented in forging. To be honest, the Remnant Ice Sword is required by Elder Mo of the internal inner sect. If you can help us with it, as the incharge of the Sword Spirit Workshop, I can promise you that the price of anything you want to forge in the future will reduce by ten times.”

Ye Qingtang was not interested at first, but her eyes sparkled once she heard the words “reduce by ten times.”

The price of forging in the Sword Spirit Workshop was extremely high.

If the price could be reduced by ten times…

Ye Qingtang was suddenly interested. She had not visited the Sword Spirit Workshop again as she did not have enough Xuanming points, and the price was too high to be affordable for her.

Reduced by ten times… Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

In the future, she would only need to spend a few hundred Xuanming points when she came for forging?

The difference between a few hundred and a few thousand was insane.

“I’m not entirely confident, but if you need, I’ll try.” Ye Qingtang did not dare to promise, but she used the frost condensate water for cooling down before in her previous life.

“How dare you to try when you are not even confident?” The blacksmiths were very dissatisfied.

The incharge stared at them before they could finish their words and said to Ye Qingtang, “We don’t have other methods now. Just try. At least it’s better to wait for the sword to be damaged.”

“Incharge, you can’t let her try…”

“Okay means it’s okay. Do you have other ways?” the incharge said coldly.

The blacksmiths shut their mouths.

They would not have discussed for so long if they had other ways.

“Are you sure?” Ye Qingtang asked again.

The incharge immediately asked people to bring over a few bucket of frost condensate water to show his attitude.

“Okay, then I’ll give a try.” Ye Qingtang rolled up her sleeves and walked to the forging table. The blacksmiths stared at her fiercely.

Ye Qingtang did not bother with them as she only thought of her ten times discount.

“Please bring me some ice over,” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Why do you need ice for?” The incharge was curious.

Ye Qingtang smiled and said, “You’ll see later.”

The incharge commanded people to bring ice over.

Both the frost condensate water and the ice were ready. Ye Qingtang placed the red Remnant Ice Sword into the frost condensate water. The thick frost condensate water immediately surrounded the sword, but it did not evaporate. However, the sword was still hot, and there was no sign of cooling down.

“Like I said, how can the frost condensate water cool down the sword?” The blacksmiths sneered.

The incharge also frowned and became skeptical.

Ye Qingtang did not care about their discussion. She put a large amount of ice on the frost condensate water as the sword was surrounded completely by the frost condensate water.

The frost condensate water was extremely hot now due to conduction, and so the ice placed melted immediately and turned into water vapor.
