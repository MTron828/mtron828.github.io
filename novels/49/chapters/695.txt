Swoosh!

Without giving Clan Master Zhou a chance to explain himself, Ye Qingtang shot her palm out and killed him with the impact.

“Ah…”

Retreating backward, the numerous high-ranking executives were filled with fear and horror as they looked at Ye Qingtang.

“F*ck you all. Retribution is here, isn’t it!” The little white tiger strutted back into Ye Qingtang’s arms.

“And you!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

In the next second, Ye Qingtang headed for that Beast Tamer Master.

She had never offended the Zhou family clan and this Beast Tamer Master, yet they wanted to steal her Fiendcelestial Beast. Since that was the case, how could Ye Qingtang let them off!

Noticing the situation, the Beast Tamer Master frowned deeply. He had no means of defense against a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord.

Helpless, the Beast Tamer Master tore a talisman, and his entire body was forced underground, vanishing completely.

“You run fast.” When Ye Qingtang saw that the Beast Tamer Master escaped, she did not plan to chase after him.

Very quickly, Ye Qingtang’s eyes landed on Zhou Fu.

Without needing to think, it must be this Zhou Fu who notified the Zhou family clan for them to come over to snatch the little white tiger when he failed to buy it.

“Senior… I was blind!”

Zhou Fu kneeled before Ye Qingtang with a thud.

Swoosh!

Ye Qingtang slashed her sword without a word, cutting Zhou Fu who was desperately pleading for mercy into pieces.

Ye Qingtang was never a compassionate person, especially after her rebirth. If anyone harbored evil designs against her, Ye Qingtang would pay them back with double the cruelty.

The remaining high-ranking executives of the Zhou family clan were filled with horror. A half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord was not someone they could fight against!

Almost instantly, more than ten of them scattered in all directions and fled out of the black market at their fastest speed ever.

Ye Qingtang glanced at them and did not stop them.

Swoosh!

Ye Qingtang appeared in front of the stunned Dragon-Tiger General in a flash.

“You said that you want to annihilate my clan earlier on?” Ye Qingtang laughed coldly as she looked at the Dragon-Tiger General who was just inches away from her.

The thousands of military cultivators saw the beautiful young man in front of their general, but no one dared to walk up.

The onlookers in the surrounding looked at Ye Qingtang in shock.

Who would have thought that a dignified half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord would also take a stroll in this kind of black market…

Furthermore, this half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord was a little too young, and no one would have drawn a connection between him and a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord.

“No wonder… No wonder he did not even care about Shangguan Rui!”

“That Shangguan Rui’s luck is extremely bad. He actually met a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord and even wanted to attack him. Wasn’t he seeking death!”

“This senior followed the black market’s rules and determined the winner using wealth… But Shangguan Rui landed himself in this plight this time…”

Everyone discussed actively as they watched Ye Qingtang.

At this instant, the Dragon-Tiger General gritted his teeth in silence, unsure of what to see.

How would he have thought that this young man would actually be a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord…

“You wanted to annihilate my clan?” Ye Qingtang asked the Dragon-Tiger General coldly again.

“This… is a misunderstanding…” Helpless, the Dragon-Tiger General could only reply that way.

“Kneel down.” Ye Qingtang ordered coldly.

“What did you say?” The Dragon-Tiger General clenched his fists tightly. This person killed his son right before him and still wanted him to kneel down now?!

“I want you to… kneel down!” There was a hint of fury in Ye Qingtang’s tone.
