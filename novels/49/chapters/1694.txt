Chapter 1695: The Fourth Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate Realm (2)

In the blink of an eye, Ye Qingtang suddenly drew out her sword and her spirit energy gathered around her weapon, moving along with it as she slashed about. A streak of sword energy suddenly shot toward the confident Baili Xuanyun.

Everyone was shocked at Ye Qingtang’s attack. No one expected Ye Qingtang to strike suddenly, and without any attempt to conceal her move. She had launched such a direct streak of sword energy...

Baili Xuanyun gave a scornful smirk as he gazed at the incoming sword energy.

With his Fourth Heaven-level powers, all attacks below this level would be totally useless against him.

Baili Xuanyun raised one hand disdainfully to block the attack.

But the moment the sword energy touched Baili Xuanyun’s arm, he felt an intense pain radiating from the point of contact. F*ck! What was happening?

Instinctively, Baili Xuanyun focused his own spirit energy on his arm to shield against the sword energy.

Even so, fresh blood was already dripping down from Baili Xuanyun’s sleeve.

“How can that be?” Baili Xuanyun gazed at the wound on his own arm. Astonishment flashed across his eyes and he gazed up at Ye Qingtang with a tight frown.

Impossible. Baili Xuanyun had witnessed the fight between Ye Qingtang and Mu Ruxue. Ye Qingtang was at most just at the Third Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate realm. She showed no signs of ascending to the level of the Fourth Heaven.

However...

Ye Qingtang’s attack was far beyond that of someone at the Third Heaven level. Just what was going on?

Still in a daze, Baili Xuanyun suddenly recalled the golden beam which had suddenly appeared earlier...

“You have broken through to the Fourth Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate realm?!” Baili Xuanyun furrowed his brows as he glared at Ye Qingtang. He completely didn’t expect Ye Qingtang to have ascended to the Fourth Heaven level within just a few short days. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Zhan Rao couldn’t help being taken aback when he heard Baili Xuanyun’s statement.

“Ye Qingtang is at the Fourth Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate Realm level now? Impossible. I would have noticed her.”

It wasn’t just Zhan Rao. Nearly everyone thought that Ye Qingtang was below the Fourth Heaven level. No one expected Ye Qingtang to break through to the Fourth Heaven in just a few days’ time.

Baili Xuanyun narrowed his eyes at Ye Qingtang. He had underestimated his opponent but... it didn’t matter.

“Not bad, I didn’t expect you to get a breakthrough at such a time. But unfortunately, you are still not my match.”

A powerful wave of spirit energy suddenly radiated from Baili Xuanyun the moment he finished his words.

The power of a Fourth Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate realm enveloped the entire arena.

Although they were both on the Fourth Heaven level, the fighter who was at the advanced stage could easily crush an opponent who had just ascended!

Ye Qingtang became more vigilant as she observed the energy radiating from Baili Xuanyun. As she had just broken through to the Fourth Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate realm, she was well aware of the differences between the early and advanced stages.

“You have made your attack. Ye Qingtang, it’s my turn now!” Baili Xuanyun exuded an intense murderous aura as his spirit energy morphed into an enormous golden dragon!

“Sh*t, things look bad. Little girl, be careful!” Jiang Yiran’s heart gave a violent jolt when he saw Baili Xuanyun’s attack. After all, Jiang Yanyun had been defeated by Baili Xuanyun’s golden dragon attack!
