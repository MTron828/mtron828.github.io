Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Elder Qin walked up to the ring immediately and announced the list of names who entered the inner sect this time. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Apart from the top three people on the Excellence Roll, Lin Feng obtained the qualifications to enter the inner sect as a disciple of Elder Lin.

The four people walked up to the ring. Ji Xianyuan’s wound was already bandaged by the physician. Although his face was still a little pale, his extraordinary charisma never decreased.

And what attracted people’s attention the most was naturally Ye Qingtang.

At that instant, all the outer sect disciples looked at Ye Qingtang in extreme shock. The match today challenged all of their knowledge.

To enter the outer sect from the inner sect, most disciples would have to take years, and some might not even have this opportunity even in ten years. Yet, unexpectedly… Ye Qingtang actually topped the Excellence Roll after entering the sect for only a few months!

This was the fastest speed in Xuanling Sect’s history!

“From today on, you all are Xuanling Sect’s inner sect disciples and must place the sect’s glory as a priority.” Elder Qin looked at the four valiant disciples before him and handed a waist tablet to each of them.

That was proof that symbolized that they were in the inner sect. The four people accepted the waist tablet. From now on, they were no longer outer sect disciples but members of the inner sect.

It was only one step away but a world of differences.

All the disciples below the ring looked on in envy.

With this inner sect waist tablet, Ye Qingtang and the other three people were different from them.

Ye Qingtang looked at the familiar waist tablet and a smile flashed across her eyes. In the previous lifetime, Ye Qingtang spent countless years in order to obtain the qualification to enter the inner sect.

“Ye Qingtang,” Elder Qin suddenly said.

Ye Qingtang walked up immediately.

“Here.”

There was a smile in Elder Qin’s eyes when he looked at Ye Qingtang. Ever since Ye Qingtang participated in the sect assessment, she had brought him many surprises. Now that she entered the inner sect with such brilliant results, it was really great.

“You placed first in the assessment this year. According to the sect rules, the number one can receive a reward from the Xuanming Pavilion.” Then, Elder Qin handed a scroll to Ye Qingtang in front of everyone.

“Later, you can bring this scroll to the Xuanming Pavilion and exchange for your reward.”

Ye Qingtang received the scroll with a calm expression, though her heart was filled with flutters.

Challenging Ji Xianyuan was exactly to obtain this reward!

The disciples watched Ye Qingtang keep the scroll with overflowing envy in their eyes.

This scroll could allow Ye Qingtang to choose any item below fifty thousand Xuanming points in the Xuanming Pavilion, regardless of whether it was a cultivation technique scroll, weapon, spirit pet or elixir.

To the outer sect, fifty thousand Xuanming points was simply an unimaginable number. Many people might not be able to earn so many Xuanming points in their entire lifetime, and it was even more impossible to touch those precious treasures.

Everyone could not do anything other than feeling envious of her.

Ye Qingtang’s skills were displayed before their eyes, and even if they were envious, they could only watch on.

After all…

Ye Qingtang entered the inner sect as the number one on the Excellence Roll. With their little skills, there was no way they could be regarded in the same category!

Seeing that everything was settled, Elder Qin decided to return to the inner sect first. However, at that instant, an extremely swift figure flew past at a speed where no one could see it clearly.
