Chapter 1807: Scorched Hot Lands (3)

Without any hesitation, Little White Tiger raced frantically towards the dilapidated building. While it was extremely run down, it would at least give them temporary relief from the flames.

Having been rained down with the molten magma, Little White Tiger was already burning from the fire. As it entered the building and escaped the relentless flames, it roared and put Ye Qingtang and Little Heavenly Demon down as it rolled on the ground to extinguish the flames.

“F*ck, that burned! Hot hot hot!” Little White Tiger roared as it shrank in size. It’s black and white fur was now burnt in patches!

It looked like a balding wild cat.

Even though Ye Qingtang had been terrified of the raining flames just now, she couldn’t help but laugh as she looked at Little White Tiger’s pathetic state. In return, Little White Tiger glared ferociously at her.

“Damn you, how dare you laugh at me. If not for me, the one burning would be- ow ow ow! You damned rascal, what are you biting!” Just as Little White Tiger opened its mouth to complain, Little Heavenly Demon smelled the familiar char and came over to feast on its tail!

Its sharp teeth brought Little White Tiger to tears and it quickly ran away.

Still the Little Heavenly Demon refused to let go of Little White Tiger’s tail and went flying with it.

Ye Qingtang was speechless as she looked at the two of them giving her a headache. She pulled Little Heavenly Demon off Little White Tiger’s tail.

Little White Tiger, which had already been in a pathetic state after being burnt was now clutching its tail miserably as it glared at Little Heavenly Demon, its face full of innocence.

Damn it, these two were both ungrateful scum!

It had sacrificed its magnificent fur for them. One of them was laughing like there was no tomorrow at him and the other only wanted a taste of its flesh!

A pair of cold-hearted b*stards!

“Alright, alright. You did well,” Ye Qingtang comforted it.

Hmpf! Little White Tiger snorted arrogantly and turned its head away.

Did this damned woman think he was so easy to placate?

Ye Qingtang looked at the arrogant Little White Tiger and didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. But she had no time to waste on this.

She looked out at the raining flames outside turning the earth into a sea of fire. They had managed to avoid further damage from the flames for now but their surroundings were rising in temperature.

If not for the Deity Ocean which was lowering her temperature slightly, she would have died from the extreme temperature.

“Looking at this place, I think it used to be a palace,” Little White Tiger finally dropped its arrogant act and lifted its head to survey their surroundings.

It seemed like they were in an abandoned palace. They could tell from the run-down walls that the place had been damaged for a long time now. There was already a thick layer of dust inside.

Ye Qingtang looked around at the ruins. Even though this place was dilapidated, it had retained traces of its former grandeur. Beautiful and intricate images were carved on a giant pillar holding up half of the collapsed palace.

Ye Qingtang froze as she saw the picture.

“I’ve seen this kind of totem before.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“You’ve seen it before? Where?” Little White Tiger asked.

“You should have seen it before as well,” Ye Qingtang replied.

“Huh?” Little White Tiger’s expression was filled with confusion.

“In the temple of the Cursed Land, remember?” Ye Qingtang stepped forward and rubbed the dust off the pillar, revealing the picture underneath.
