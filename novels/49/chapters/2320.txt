Wu Fengling smiled. “It is the Netherworld Academy’s honor to have a teacher like you. You have produced a good child.”

Ye Qingtang lowered her eyes, a smile flashing across her pupils. She was well aware of how good her own brats were.

Upon hearing Wu Fengling praise Ye Qing, Wen Qi felt very happy as he said, “That’s not all. I heard that Mu Ziying has also risen to the Divine Lord stage. Ye Qing has produced two Divine Lord level students.”

“Oh? Really?” Wu Fengling’s eyes brightened.

Wen Qi had heard of this from Luo Sheng. Before the smiles on the faces of those two men had finished forming, the teacher in charge of the matches cleared his throat.

“Ahem, not just those two. Lei Yan, Nangong Lie and Jing Ze have all ascended to the Divine Lord stage also.”

Both Wu Fengling and Wen Qi looked astounded.

Five Divine Lord stage practitioners?!

As well-traveled as Wu Fengling was, he had never met anyone who could produce so many Divine Lord stage students over such a short period of time.

Wen Qi’s eyes widened in disbelief.

Five?!

Did he hear correctly?

“Hang Wenwei, Gong Jinyun and a few others were defeated. Two of them even had to be carried off…” the teacher-in-charge continued.

Hang Wenwei and the others who had been named sheepishly hid in the crowd.

Damn, they have really been humiliated today!

In the next moment, the faces of the President and Vice-President shifted. They looked at Ye Qing with complicated expressions.

“We will count this match as a draw. It will never end if we let it continue. And if either of them suffers grievous injuries, it will affect our chances at the Inter-Academy Competition. That would then be a major loss,” Wu Fengling announced.

Given that the President had spoken and declared the match a draw, for the first time in the history of the Netherworld Academy, there were two students ranked number one.

Ran Mo didn’t mind. Qin Feng looked at Ye Qing and saw that he didn’t have any reaction, and so he agreed.

Observing Qin Feng’s actions, Wu Fengling couldn’t help feeling amused.

This kid would continue fighting if his teacher disagreed?

The thought amused Wu Fengling greatly.

“Your teacher is very good. Don’t waste his teaching efforts,” Wu Fengling said.

Qin Feng, Lei Yan and the others nodded. As long as one praised their Boss, they would agree to anything!

Ye Qingtang didn’t know whether to laugh or cry at those little brats. But her heart felt warm.

It was getting late and the selection trials were over for the day. Di Nuo had already snuck off when no one was paying attention. Surrounded by her students, Ye Qingtang and her group prepared to leave, but Wu Fengling called her back.

“Ye Qing.”

“Yes, President?” Ye Qingtang looked at Wu Fengling and Wen Qi.

“If you are not busy, please come with me. I have something to discuss with you,” Wu Fengling said.

Ye Qingtang nodded and had her students go back to rest first. She would join them for a celebration after she finished her discussion with Wu Fengling.

Ye Qingtang followed Wu Fengling and his group back to the President’s room. After entering the room, Wu Fengling invited them to sit down.

“Ye Qing, amongst your students, Yun Chen is the only one who has yet to be selected for the Inter-Academy Competition. But I heard from the medicine faculty that under your guidance, Yun Chen’s elixir-refining skills have improved tremendously. I think there shouldn’t be an issue tomorrow. You have done very well and groomed several exceptional students for the Netherworld Academy. As the President, I must thank you,” Wu Fengling said with sincerity.
