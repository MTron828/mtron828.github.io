Chapter 1052 Beiming Manor (3)

Yunxiao Sect’s annihilation was a given, but no one had expected it to be annihilated so quickly. A dignified super sect with centuries of foundation, however, became part of the Ye Family in such a short period of time.

At this instant, the Ye Family disciples and several Branch Masters were covered with murderous auras. This was their first battle since becoming part of the Ye Family.

This war was truly too shocking. Yunxiao Sect was wipe out so swiftly that they did not even make any moves…

It was also because of such that the Ye Family members finally witnessed the unparalleled powers of a Yang Lord. Even if Yunxiao Sect was a super sect and had powerful foundations, it still ended up in such an ending

“Anyone who wishes to resist the Ye Family, come out!”

At this instant, a Ye Family disciple swept across the remaining elders and wardens in Yunxiao Sect and shouted coldly.

However, no one dared to say anything.

“Humph! So what about your Ye Family! You all will still face death after offending Beiming Manor!” A Yunxiao Sect disciple who appeared from nowhere said coldly.

“You have a death wish!”

Upon hearing that, a glint flashed across the eyes of that Ye Family youth at the half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord realm. With a “clank”, that YunXiao Sect disciple’s head was already chopped off by the Ye Family disciple before the Yunxiao Sect disciple knew what happened.

Clank!

He unsheathed and sheathed his sword in one breath, and that was all it took to kill someone.

“Any resistors… kill!”

The Ye Family youth shouted loudly, and he was brimming with killing intent. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Little young one, how arrogant of you!”

All of a sudden, a bone-curdling cold filled the air, and the temperature of the surroundings dropped to the freezing point in an instant.

A middle-aged man in a gold Chinese robe walked out of Yunxiao Sect slowly with a young male and female beside him.

That man’s martial skills were frightening and had already reached the peak of Yin Yang Perfected Lord Fourth Heaven.

“Beiming Manor envoy…”

In the sky, the Yuehua Sect Grand Elder’s and Lingyun Sect Grand Elder’s eyes twinkled when they saw the appearance of that middle-aged man.

It seemed that Yunxiao Sect’s annihilation enraged Beiming Manor utterly…

Beneath, the Ye Family talented disciple shivered at that cold shout, and his body retreated backward.

The Ye Family talented youth was merely a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord and naturally could not contest against the Beiming Manor envoy, who was at the peak of Yin Yang Perfected Lord Fourth Heaven.

“You’re pretty arrogant yourself too!”

Ye Qingtang hollered immediately and easily dissipated the powerful martial aura of that Beiming Manor envoy.

It was only until then did the Ye Family youth’s complexion improve, and he looked at Ye Qingtang with gratitude.

“A Yang Lord is here. Hurry bow and pay your respects to the Yang Lord!”

A Ye Family Branch Master looked at the Beiming Manor envoy without fear and sneered

The Beiming Manor envoy frowned slightly upon hearing that. She’s actually a Yang Lord…

“How dare you!” The Beiming Manor envoy yelled in fury. “I am Beiming Manor’s Great Warden. How dare you make me bow and pay my respects?!”

The Beiming Manor Great Warden was the head of all wardens. Although his position was lower than that of Elders and the Chief, he was also considered to have a high position and authority, and he represented Beiming Manor with full authority when he was out. How dare this force make him bow and pay respects?!
