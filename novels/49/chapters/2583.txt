“Jiuyou, what’s wrong with you today?” Mother Feng frowned as he looked at Feng Jiuyou. He was already at this age, why was he getting up to mischief every day?

Furthermore, this was not the only time. It seemed that Feng Jiuyou would encounter a few crises every month, which made Mother Feng extremely worried.

“Miss Ye Yue, is it? Thank you.” Mother Feng smiled at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang shook her head and said softly, “It was nothing.”

In fact, Ye Qingtang did not expect that a Divine Lord practitioner like Feng Jiuyou would be afraid of water.

“By the way, I heard from Jiuyou that Miss Ye Yue is not a local. Are you from the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain?” After a while, Father Feng stepped forward and asked Ye Qingtang.

“That’s right. I am indeed from the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain.” Ye Qingtang nodded. “This is my first time in the Divine Venerate Domain and I happened to meet Feng Jiuyou who fell into the water, and I saved him.”

“Falling into the water…”

Mother Feng sized up Feng Jiuyou with an unhappy expression. “Jiuyou, you went to Mt. Zhong again?”

Feng Jiuyou chuckled uneasily. His parents never allowed him to go to such places. He always had to sneak over there.

“Miss Ye Yue, this must seem like a joke to you. This is not the first time Jiuyou has fallen into the water. Although he is a Divine Lord, he gets nervous the moment he falls into the water,” Father Feng said to Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang did not say much about this. It was just that she did not expect the future famous Feng Jiuyou to know about the Fear Water.

After a while, Mother Feng said to Ye Qingtang, “Miss Ye Yue is really something. You came to the Divine Venerate Domain from the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain all alone. Do you have any relatives or friends here?” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“No, I just wanted to experience the Divine Venerate Domain,” Ye Qingtang said with a smile.

“Dad, Mom, Sister Ye Yue is unfamiliar with this place and doesn’t have any friends here. Why don’t we let Sister Ye Yue stay here for a few days so that she can get to know this place better?” Feng Jiuyou suggested.

Father Feng stared at Ye Qingtang thoughtfully. After a long while, he looked at Mother Feng who nodded and said to Ye Qingtang, “Miss Ye Yue, although our Feng Family is just a small family clan, we have many guest rooms. If you don’t mind, you can stay here for a few days. How about that?”

“Thank you and I am sorry to trouble you.” Ye Qingtang responded.

It would be best for Ye Qingtang if she could stay in the Feng family for a few days.

Ye Qingtang glanced towards Father and Mother Feng and considered them. Their skills were not considered strong either. They were only at the Second Heaven level Divine Lord.

Not everyone in the Divine Venerate Domain was an expert. Most practitioners had average martial arts skills and did not have outstanding bloodline powers. Most peaked at the Fourth Heaven level Divine Lord.

Only an extremely small percentage of practitioners managed to enter the Immortal Emperor stage.

Actually, small factions did produce many descendants and disciples whose martial arts strength was extremely strong, They displayed extremely powerful bloodline powers and martial arts talent from a young age. However, it was rather common for such folks to die prematurely in the Divine Venerate

Domain. Many regions were under the control of massive factions. Those large factions would never allow those talented martial arts practitioners from the small factions to survive. Once discovered, they would use all sorts of methods to destroy them.

“Twonder what Miss Ye Yue’s cultivation level is? I can’t deduce it at all,” Father Feng examined Ye Qingtang..
