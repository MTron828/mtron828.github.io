Chapter 1149: Ultimate Elder (1)

“Space Technique…”

The golden-robed man frowned deeply as he looked at the old man standing casually nearby.

The Space Technique was one of the most powerful and mysterious forces. Legend had it that when cultivated to the highest level, the Space Technique allowed one to manipulate space at will. Within the span of a single breath, one could traverse a distance of ten thousand miles…

“The Ultimate Elder…”

Blood Moon Elder shuddered when he saw the new arrival. This white-haired old man dressed in white robes was certainly the Ultimate Elder…

“That old pervert… his power is comparable to that of the Holy Lord… he may even be more powerful than the Holy Lord in some aspects…” Blood Moon Elder looked at the Ultimate Elder in shock. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Although the Blood Moon Holy Lord was the spiritual incarnation of the Heavenly Emperor, the power of the Blood Moon Holy Lord could be said to be unrivaled in this mainland…

But this Ultimate Elder had been fighting the Blood Moon Holy Lord for years, from which one could deduce how powerful he was.

“Hey… little girl, haven’t I seen you somewhere before?”

The Ultimate Elder’s gaze suddenly fell on Ye Qingtang.

“You haven’t just seen me before… Once, you used a force seal and frightened my thousand-league horse until it stiffened up and couldn’t move.” The corners of Ye Qingtang’s mouth twitched.

The Ultimate Elder was one of the three legendary powerful cultivators in this mainland. Besides him, there was the Pagoda Sword Master, who had left this mainland long ago, and the Blood Moon Holy Lord.

But this Ultimate Elder could be said to be “devoted” to the Blood Moon Holy Lord. For many years, he had hunted him without giving up.

“Oh… is that so…” When he heard that, Ultimate Elder propped his chin on his hands and thought for a while. Then he suddenly slapped his thigh…”That’s right, I remember now… I was hunting the Blood Moon Holy Lord at that time…”

“…”

The moment he mentioned the Blood Moon Holy Lord, Ye Qingtang felt her head ache.

So it was that younger brother she had picked up along the way that had turned into an Invincible Slayer…

This Ultimate Elder was certainly very “clear” about things related to the Blood Moon Holy Lord.

When the golden-robed man saw the Ultimate Elder chatting with Ye Qingtang as if no one else existed, he felt neglected. His expression darkened, and he glared at the Ultimate Elder and said, “Lord, are you overlooking something.”

When the Ultimate Elder heard that, he turned and studied the golden-robed man.

“You… are the invader of Central Mainland?”

Although Ultimate Elder came and went as he pleased, he had noticed that Central Mainland had been invaded.

“You can interpret it that way if you like,” said the golden-robed man.

“Did you ask my permission before entering this mainland?” asked the Ultimate Elder.

“We of the Ancient You Clan do not have the habit of consulting dead people.” The golden-robed man laughed coldly.

Before the Ultimate Elder could continue speaking, the power of a Heavenly Venerate rushed forth. It swiftly sealed the area and pressed down towards the Ultimate Elder.

When he saw that, a cold light shone in Ultimate Elder’s eyes. He raised his right hand and pointed at the void in front of him.

The next second, they could see that the surrounding space rapidly twist, as if heaven and earth were exchanging places. The golden-robed man’s Heavenly Venerate powers were largely absorbed by the twisted space.

“Ah… Ah… I didn’t expect this mainland to have a powerful cultivator who understands the Space Technique… not bad.” The golden-robed man looked at the Ultimate Elder, and his lips curved upwards. “This is interesting. Otherwise, this excursion to exterminate this mainland would be too boring.”
