As Qin Huan landed, he stepped on the area that was sealed by the ice and fell hideously as he lost his balance.

“Ha… The ignorants are fearless.” Ning Luo glanced down at the Xuanling Sect disciples arrogantly. “Just based on you ants, you all thought that you could smash my Paragon Skill. What a joke.”

“Ning Luo, you ungrateful betrayer. Release Junior Sister Ye now. Otherwise, you will definitely die once the sect elders arrive!” Qin Huan hollered angrily as he pointed at Ning Luo.

“Xuanling Sect elders?”

Disdain flashed across Ning Luo’s eyes.

He had never respected those so-called elders in Xuanling Sect. Even if they rushed here in time, what could they do to him?

“Senior Brother Ning Luo, it is never too late to repent. Release Junior Sister Ye now… Things are still reversible!” Zhu Changge persuaded Ning Luo as he saw that Ye Qingtang was about to be completely sealed in the ice.

However, Ning Luo waved his right arm, and an icy air charged at them, causing them to collapse on the ground.

“You little ants, even killing you all would be dirtying my hands.” Ning Luo returned his focus to Ye Qingtang.

At that moment, the ice had already extended to Ye Qingtang’s abdomen and had no signs of stopping.

“Ye Qingtang, I am also one who cherishes talents. It is indeed admirable that you can reach this stage, live up to this day, and even force me to use my Paragon Skill as a red spirit root… It is a pity though that I cannot defy Senior Sister Ye You’s orders, and I can only take your life to account to the sect. But apart from this, if you still have any wishes, perhaps I will help you to accomplish them if I am able to,” Ning Luo said as he looked at Ye Qingtang who was unable to move.

Currently, the ice had already extended to Ye Qingtang’s flawless neck, and it reached the crown of her head before she could say anything.

At that very instant, Ye Qingtang turned into an ice statue with no exposed area for her to breathe.

“Junior Sister Ye!”

The Xuanling Sect disciples were horrified at the sight.

Although Ye Qingtang was already very powerful… Ning Luo was at Martial Qi Level Three and understood the Paragon Skill of the Frost as a green spirit root. No matter how powerful Ye Qingtang was, how could she be Ning Luo’s opponent!

“Ning Luo, you bastard! How dare you kill Junior Sister Ye! I must avenge Junior Sister Ye!” Qin Huan shouted furiously and was ready to battle it out with Ning Luo.

However, after taking only a few steps, Qin Huan slipped and fell on the ground once again.

Zhu Changge and the other Xuanling Sect disciples darted forward and helped Qin Huan up hurriedly.

“Don’t stop me! I must kill this bastard!” Qin Huan screamed.

“Calm down!” Zhu Changge grabbed Qin Huan’s arm tightly.

It was simply delusional for them to defeat Ning Luo with their skills. If they acted rashly now, wouldn’t it be losing a few more lives?!

If that was the case, what was the meaning of Ye Qingtang’s death!

“Hold on!”

Ignoring Qin Huan who was struggling desperately, a Xuanling Sect disciple was shocked as he pointed at Ye Qingtang who had turned into a statue.

Zhu Changge and the rest looked in that direction instinctively.

At that instant, the ice on Ye Qingtang’s body seemed to be melting. An inexplicable flame aura blended with the force of the cold ice…

Boom!

Before they returned to their senses, the sturdy ice on Ye Qingtang’s body exploded instantly.

“You must be kidding?!”

Qin Huan’s jaw dropped as he stared at Ye Qingtang.
