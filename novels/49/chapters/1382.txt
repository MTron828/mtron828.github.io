Chapter 1383 Exposing the Fraud 1

The Emperor of the Yuan Kingdom felt his legs shaking when he saw the sharp sword slashing towards his head. He immediately covered his head and shrieked.

However…

He did not feel the pain that he was expecting. He then opened his eyes secretly and saw…

Ye Qingtang, who was sitting on the seat, raised her hand and used two fingers to stop the sword that was slashing towards the Emperor of the Yuan Kingdom.

Ye Qingtang looked up. Her lips curved into a smile when she saw the group of envoys rushing towards her. She looked down again at the next second and remained still. However, she surged out her aura, and her white sleeve was floating under the influence of the aura.

Boom, boom!!

After the aura was released, invisible waves of air filled the entire place.

Within a blink of time, the group of envoys were thrown out, and the weapons in their hands fell to the ground as they groaned in pain.

“What happened?” All the believers were in shock when they saw the envoys rolling around on the ground.

“I… I don’t know…”

Everyone felt confused as no one saw any movement, and the envoys were thrown out.

Only the Emperor of the Yuan Kingdom looked towards Ye Qingtang in delight.

The Immortal… finally decided to take action!

“Dragon Court Sect is just like that.” Ye Qingtang stood up slowly and glanced at the envoys on the ground. A cold smile appeared on her face.

“How dare you offend the Dragon Court Sect?!” The believers did not know how the situation happened, but their expression changed when they heard that a quack was disrespecting the Dragon Court Sect.

“Immortal, do not need to be angry with such a quack. We’ll handle her,” Emperor Qi and the rest said in order to please the Dragon Court Sect. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

They brought many powerful people. The moment they gave their orders, near a hundred people walked forward.

“Do you know that you’ll never make it alive out of here today, quack? Who are you! How dare you offend the Dragon Court Sect! We need to let you know the consequences of offending the Dragon Court Sect and the dignity of the Immortal!” Emperor Qi said.

Ye Qingtang lost some of the interest when she stared at those “powerful” people.

“Just shut up and come.” Ye Qingtang did not bother to waste time on them. She lifted her chin slightly to provoke them.

Emperor Qi and the rest had never seen someone who was so arrogant. They immediately asked all of those powerful people to restrain Ye Qingtang and the others from the Yuan Kingdom.

The people Emperor Qi and the rest brought were the most powerful figures in their respective kingdoms. It would take only a second to settle the issue.

The powerful people held their swords and dashed forward. All of them wanted to please the Dragon Court Sect, and they did not bother to show any mercy.

However, before they could even touch Ye Qingtang’s clothes, a flame appeared by Ye Qingtang’s fingertip. As she flickered her finger, the flame rushed towards those powerful people.

In just the blink of an eye, the flame was like a wildfire and spread on those people’s bodies.

They did not even have time to try to extinguish the fire and were burned into ashes instantly.

Hundreds of powerful people turned into ashes in front of everyone in a second…
