Chapter 1730: Little Heavenly Demon (1)

She instinctively turned back to look.

A pitch-black little thing was a few meters behind her. It was standing upon the snowy grounds and exuding a demonic aura that was intensely suffocating. That aura radiated in all directions continuously, completely suppressing the pack of giant ice wolves.

Little White Tiger turned to take a look and that one glance scared it so much that its eyeballs bulged out in an almost comical manner.

A little thing surrounded by black demonic aura such that no one could see what it looked like. The only feature that could be seen through that aura was a pair of devilish eyes.

“Damn... is that a... Heavenly Demon?”

Little white tiger widened its eyes in disbelief.

“Heavenly Demon?” Ye Qingtang was stunned.

“Apart from from a Heavenly Demon, who else could exude such a powerful and pure demonic aura? But... why is there still a Heavenly Demon over here? Moreover... it seems to be helping us?” Little White Tiger narrowed its eyes suspiciously.

Ye Qingtang would never have thought that it was a Heavenly Demon who was watching them from outside the cave! But the legends claimed that they only existed in...

“Uh... to be exact, it is a little Heavenly Demon. Look at its size, it seems to be a newborn.” Little White Tiger sized up the little Heavenly Demon as he speculated.

“Little Heavenly Demon... why is it helping us?” Ye Qingtang stared at those devilish eyes.

“How would I know? Perhaps it feels that we are its prey and will not allow other monsters to touch us? Or perhaps... it likes us better?” Little White Tiger also didn’t understand.

Would a Heavenly Demon take a fancy toward a human and a beast? Ye Qingtang felt it was more likely that the Heavenly Demon was just reserving them for later.

Regardless...

She was completely despondent at the thought.

Being targeted by a Heavenly Demon was 10 times worse than being targeted by an Ice King.

On the other hand, it was still a baby Heavenly Demon...

But a Heavenly Demon was as powerful as a True God. Could they have any hopes of defending themselves against it?

“No matter what, at least it has no intention of killing us... For now. Let’s hurry up and leave. The Heavenly Demon has no likes, dislikes, happiness or sadness. No one can guess their temperament.” Gazing at the pack of giant ice wolves, Little White Tiger didn’t dare to stay a minute longer. It flew off carrying Ye Qingtang.

Who knew why that Little Heavenly Demon had its eye on them?

The Little Heavenly Demon stared after Ye Qingtang and Little White Tiger as they left. Its eyes seemed to narrow uneasily and in the blink of an eye, it continued to follow them at a frightening pace.

“Damn, why is it following us again?!” Little White Tiger could clearly feel the demon aura behind it and broke out in cold sweat.

This Little Heavenly Demon truly had its eye on them!

Ye Qingtang was also at a loss. She turned to see the fast approaching demonic aura, only to discover that although it was following them, it had no intention of catching up. As fast as it was, it maintained a few meters gap behind them.

Perhaps because of the Little Heavenly Demon and its thick demon aura, the powerful monsters nearby had all backed off? Ye Qingtang’s journey ended up being very smooth-sailing.

After flying for a long time, the sky was gradually darkening and Little White Tiger had to find a glacier to stop and rest.
