Chapter 2255: Escape (1)

Ye Qingtang looked on with cold eyes as the crowd surged into the door. She secretly glanced to the side.

As expected, lured by the prospect of obtaining the legacy, the Rising Dragon Island men left the unconscious Mu Ziying alone outside the door.

None of the major factions would let go of this great chance to obtain the fiendcelestial’s will. They would not leave any one of their men outside the door as this would only decrease their chances of winning.

Moreover…

Mu Ziying was already unconscious. Whatever reward the Rising Dragon Island would gain from her kidnapping would not be as valuable as the fiendcelestial’s will. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Lei Yan and the others also didn’t enter the door. They had come to rescue Mu Ziying and now that everyone had entered the door, they immediately knew this was their chance. But they saw that the black-robed Ye Qingtang was standing outside the door with the Night Soul Beast.

They hesitated but believed that she would not bother with them. So they reached out to grab Mu Ziying. All the while Qin Feng kept his eye on Ye Qingtang as they did so, deeply afraid that this mysterious black-robed person would move against them.

Ye Qingtang heaved a secret sigh of relief on seeing those brats carrying Mu Ziying away. But now, she was focusing her attention on what was happening behind that door.

After the various factions rushed in, they behaved like demons, madly searching for something in that illusory space.

The door suddenly closed up.

With a loud bang, everyone was now trapped inside.

In the next second, Ye Qingtang turned and said to the vigilant Qin Feng and gang, “Leave.”

Qin Feng and the rest were taken aback. After confirming that she was talking to them, they were filled with suspicion.

They stared vigilantly at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang was speechless, but now was not the time to get into a discussion. She could already hear the sounds of fighting from behind that door.

Inheriting the fiendcelestial’s will. It was all just bullshit dreamed up by Ye Qingtang to deceive those people.

In her previous life, Ye Qingtang had heard many stories about the fiendcelestial’s tomb and knew that several illusory doors existed not far from the entrance.

These doors could conjure what you most desired. Since Ye Qingtang appeared, she had been quietly selling the idea of the fiendcelestial’s will to those factions.

By the time they entered the tomb, passed the Matrix Path and arrived at the illusory doors, the desire that Ye Qingtang had implanted in everyone’s subconscious was now enough to become an illusion.

As long as they stepped beyond this door, their most desired thing would appear. And at this moment, the one thing which all those people most desired was the fiendcelestial’s will, which Ye Qingtang had been quietly guiding their subconscious toward.

This was also why Ye Qingtang dared to hoodwink these major factions.

But the illusion would not last for long. After the various factions started fighting, their mindsets would start to change and the illusions would also evolve. With their sharp eyes, it wouldn’t take long for them to realize that something was off.

Ye Qingtang had to quickly get Mu Ziying away before they realized this.

Lei Yan and the rest were clearly distrustful of the black-robed person. They instinctively shielded Mu Ziying and took up a protective stance.

“Mighty one, we have no intention of obtaining the fiendcelestial’s will. We came into the tomb by accident. Mighty one, please…” Yun Chen spoke politely.

After all, they did not wish to engage this black-robed person who could control a Night Soul Beast.
