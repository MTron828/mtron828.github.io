Chapter 1033 Return to the Sect (1)

Naturally, no one dared to voice their doubts.

“From today onward, the Ye Family will wage war against YunXiao Sect. I want YunXiao Sect to cease to exist.” Ye Qingtang declared.

Ye Ling and the Second Elder were startled. Ye Qingtang actually planned to annihilate Yunxiao Sect… Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

However, given the combat powers of a Yang Lord, it was an easy feat to annihilate Yunxiao Sect.

Although a sect like Yunxiao Sect had extremely powerful foundations, given Ye Qingtang’s Yang Lord combat power, it was not impossible to completely destroy Yunxiao Sect.

Currently, the Ye Family was already strong enough, and Xuanling Sect came to mind.

To completely wipe out Xuanling Sect, which had a strong foundation, time was required. The pressing matter at the moment was to head to Xuanling Sect and rescue it from Yunxiao Sect.

Furthermore, it was time to settle the scores with Yunxiao Sect.

After the trip to the Dragon Vein, Ye Qingtang’s martial realm entered the Yang Lord of the Yin Yang Perfected Lord, and she could easily rescue Xuanling Sect without using the power of her bloodline.

However, it was not simple to annihilate Yunxiao Sect.

Although Yunxiao Sect did not have any Yang Lords, a sect’s foundation was extremely powerful

For example, in the battle between Xuanling Sect and Yunxiao Sect, Yunxiao Sect’s skills surpassed that of Xuanling Sect massively, but Xuanling Sect could still inflict huge damage by relying on its heritage and foundation.

Even an ordinary sect like Xuanling Sect had such frightening foundation, much less YunXiao Sect, a super sect.

“Eldest Young Lady, with those YunXiao Sect senior members, there is nothing to be afraid of. It’s just that we are unclear of Yunxiao Sect’s foundation and heritage.” Daoist Zijin looked at Ye Qingtang and said.

Ye Qingtang was fully aware of this point without Daoist Zijin’s reminder as well.

Given the Yin Yang Perfected Lord Third Heaven cultivation base of Daoist Zijin and Bai Kui, they could defeat Yunxiao Sect’s Grand Elder and Sect Master. However, once Yunxiao Sect used their foundation and went all out, the outcome would be uncertain.

To completely destroy Yunxiao Sect, it was probably insufficient with just Bai Kui, Daoist Zijin, and the new Yin Yang Perfected Lords who joined the Ye Family.

“Eldest Young Lady, I’m afraid you will also need to be present to annihilate Yunxiao Sect,” Elder Bai Kui looked at Ye Qingtang and said.

Ye Qingtang nodded slightly.

After discussing the details with Elder Bai Kui and the rest, Ye Qingtang departed from Lin Town and flew towards Xuanling Sect.

Currently, the little white tiger’s seemed to be growing; thus, it was still in a deep sleep. As such, Ye Qingtang left it at the Ye Family and did not bring it along with her.

Given Ye Qingtang’s current speed, she had already arrived at the periphery of Xuanling Sect in less than half a day.

The sect, which was originally floating in the sky, however, landed on the ground, and the entire sect was enveloped by a faint golden screen.

This screen was initially set up by the Blood Moon Holy Lord and could sustain for only half a year.

Presently, this screen was no longer as strong as initially, and its light was increasingly dimming.

Several Yunxiao Sect disciples guarded the surroundings of Xuanling Sect. Once this screen broke, they would notify the senior members of the sect immediately and wipe out Xuanling Sect without sparing anyone.

“Quickly look! That lady…”
