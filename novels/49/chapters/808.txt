Chapter 809 Blade (1)

Although Ye Qingtang’s cultivation base was already at half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord, it was far from sufficient.

Not mentioning the skills of the Peerless School, there was still a threat from the Central Mainland.

Currently, the Dimension Wall was already broken, and this mainland would probably face a calamity sometime soon.

The only thing Ye Qingtang could do now was to raise her martial skills rapidly.

On this mainland, there were no other destinies for her to advance to the Yin Yang Perfected Lord state rapidly apart from the Dragon Vein.

After a while, Ye Qingtang arrived at the Bliss Forging Workshop.

As in the past, there were still many visitors, including the Nine Nights Dynasty royals, at the Bliss Forging Workshop

Ye Qingtang passed through the crowd with the silver wolf and the little white tiger and entered the Bliss Forging Workshop rapidly.

“Young Sir Ye, you’re here!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Du Sheng was stunned to see Ye Qingtang and hurriedly received her.

Ye Qingtang nodded and said, “I’m here to look for Master Du.”

Hearing that, Du Sheng immediately chased away everyone who came to visit the Bliss Forging Workshop and closed the door.

“Master has ordered that as long as Young Sir Ye comes, everyone is to be chased away, and he will only attend to Young Sir Ye.” Du Sheng smiled.

Then, Ye Qingtang was led into the inner hall by Du Sheng.

Master Du was forging a weapon in the hall at this moment.

“Master, Young Sir Ye is here!” Du Sheng announced.

Master Du hurriedly looked in Ye Qingtang’s direction and was brimming with smiles upon seeing that it was indeed Ye Qingtang. He stood up immediately and said, “Young Sir Ye, you really made me wait for a long time.”

He had been too impatient to wait for the Dragon Vein. However, it was impossible for him to enter the Dragon Vein without Ye Qingtang.

“Master Du, is the weapon that I asked you to forge complete?” Ye Qingtang asked with a smile.

“Mhm. It’s already forged. Wait for me for a moment,” Master Du said and left.

After a while, Master Du returned with a long, black sword that seemed as though it was dyed with ink.

“Black-grade…”

Ye Qingtang was in thought as she stared at the long sword.

In this world, all Dharma treasures and weapons were divided into four grades, namely Heaven, Earth, Black, and Yellow.

A yellow-grade weapon could not be compared to a black-grade weapon in any aspect.

“This sword is forged according to the prototype of the ancient sword, Regicide Sky Blade. Although it’s an imitation, it is extremely powerful and is a leader amongst the black-grade weapons,” Master Du said rather proudly.

“Regicide Sky Blade…”

Ye Qingtang mumbled.

The Regicide Sky Blade was said to be a heaven-grade weapon from the ancient era, and there were no traces of it presently.

“Thank you for your effort, Master Du.” Ye Qingtang smiled as she looked at the black-grade weapon in satisfaction.

After all, it was made from the Millennium Meteoric Iron. With Master Du’s craft on top, it would definitely be good.

After keeping the long sword, Ye Qingtang retrieved a few kilograms of meteoric iron and said, “Master Du, this is your remuneration.”

However, Master Du waved his hand and said, “Brother Ye Chen, you’re treating me as a stranger like this. With our relation, there’s no need for any remuneration.”

Ye Qingtang was rather speechless. It seemed that Master Du was determined to make her go to the Dragon Vein with him.

“Brother Ye Chen, how are you considering the matter regarding the Dragon Vein?” Master Du asked with a grin.

“You will decide on the time.” Ye Qingtang replied.
