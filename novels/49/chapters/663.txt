“Why? Are you very surprised that I can control this sword like this?” Ning Luo chuckled gently as he waved the Ice Frost Divine Sword.

“Given your heart, you don’t deserve this Heaven-grade divine weapon,” Ye Qingtang said straightforwardly.

“Don’t deserve?” Ning Luo turned around to look at Ye Qingtang. His aura actually combined perfectly with the Ice Frost Divine Sword in his hand. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Did you say that I don’t deserve this sword?” Ning Luo smiled.

It was clearly a person’s voice, but when others heard it, it seemed that the Ice Frost Divine Sword and Ning Luo spoke at the same time!

“You…”

After sensing the strange aura on Ning Luo’s body, Ye Qingtang’s expression changed immediately. She was in disbelief.

“Oh… you seem to finally sense something. It’s really not simple.” Ning Luo’s lips tugged up slightly.

“You are not a human…” Ye Qingtang frowned slightly.

“Must one be a human if he wears human skin?” Ning Luo shook his head.

“What exactly are you?” Ye Qingtang stared straight at Ning Luo.

No wonder there was no fluctuation of aura on him and she could not tell his skill level. He was not even human…

“Haha.” Ning Luo chuckled, yet it gave one a piercing coldness. “Since you said that I don’t deserve this sword… why can’t you see that I am the sword itself.”

“You said you are the Ice Frost Divine Sword?!” Ye Qingtang’s eyes were filled with shock. “You’re the Ice Frost Divine Sword’s… sword spirit!”

“Isn’t this clear yet?” As Ning Luo spoke, his aura had already combined with the Ice Frost Divine Sword to extreme perfection. Currently, Ye Qingtang could no longer tell whether the person was the sword or the sword was the person.

“Haha. Ye Qingtang, I’m the sword of that lady you talked about… My name is Ice Frost. I’m the Ice Frost Divine Sword.” Ning Luo looked at Ye Qingtang, and his lips formed into an icy smile. “Before my spiritual wisdom was activated, I had already followed her. I shared life and death with her… I shared glory with her, and she gave me the best sheath. I’ve been through adversity with her. When it is cold, she knows that I’m not afraid of the cold but still placed me before the fire. When I’m thirsty, she killed enemies while I drank their blood…”

When he said that, a cold wind roared, and frost fell faintly. “When my spiritual wisdom was first activated, I was extremely elated, but she fell into a bloody pool before me. I never thought that the people that she cared deeply for would combine forces to steal everything she had, including her life… Ye Qingtang, don’t you think it is perfectly justified for me to wipe out this mainland?”

At this instant, Ye Qingtang was speechless from the shock. She had guessed all kinds of identities that Ning Luo could have, but she never thought that he was the Ice Frost Divine Sword! Moreover, he was a sword spirit of a Heaven-grade divine sword!

In this world, ordinary weapons and Dharma treasures had spirituality, but it was not enough for their spiritual wisdom to be activated. However, as the grade of the weapons or Dharma treasures increased, its spirituality would become stronger as well.

For example, the Ice Frost Divine Sword was a Heaven-grade divine weapon and had followed the extraordinary lady for a long time. Its spiritual wisdom was finally activated, and it became a sword spirit…

In this world, there was an extremely limited number of top-notch Dharma treasures of which spiritual wisdom could be activated. Not mentioning the First Mainland, even if it was in the Third Domain of which martial culture was at its peak, a Dharma treasure with activated spiritual wisdom could cause the powerful figures that were at an Emperor level to contend for it.

For example, Ye You was a Great Empress in her previous life but did not have any fate to obtain a Heaven-grade divine weapon with an activated spiritual wisdom
