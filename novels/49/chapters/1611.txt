Chapter 1612: Don’t Move If You’re Scared (3)

For a moment, the screams of the horses and the wails of the allied soldiers filled the area. They could see allied soldiers being tossed into the air while the warhorses they rode were also flung screaming into the air...

Ye Qingtang seemed to move slowly, but by the time the allied forces wanted to act, it was too late. They found themselves behind flung skywards even before they could prepare themselves to fight. Their faces behind their helmets were filled with surprise and terror.

“What kind of strength is that?” Joseph, who was on the city wall, widened his eyes in disbelief. He had been fighting in the army for so many years, but this was his first time seeing such a simple and barbaric method of fighting.

A single slap could send a fully armored Glorious Lion Knight and his steed flying skywards?!

Even the other Kingdom Knights had widened their eyes in disbelief, not to mention Joseph. It was as if they were seeing a ghost.

One must know that Ye Qingtang was only a petite and frail young girl. If anyone of them were put in the same situation, they were certainly not capable of doing the same.

The hundreds of allied cavalry were like bales of hay being flung into the sky. When they fell to the ground, they could not move.

Behind them, the allied soldiers had grim expressions. The commander looked livid, and it was as if he had eaten something ghastly.

“Who on earth is she? Why does she have this strange power?”

“Don’t... I don’t know. She looks unfamiliar. I’ve never seen her before...” The allied forces were completely bewildered. They had never met Ye Qingtang before and thought that she had single-handedly charged forward to meet her death. But now it looked like...

She was a monster!

The allied forces’ commander looked grim. He coldly shouted. “Don’t waste time on her. The reinforcements from the Supreme League Kingdom will soon be here. We must attack the fortress before their reinforcements arrive. Archers, shoot! I want to see whether she can survive an attack by my seventy thousand archers!”

A young girl from the Supreme League Kingdom had beaten a hundred of their Glorious Lion knights. He could not stand it!

At his order, the ten thousand archers among the allied forces drew their bows. The next moment, a dense shower of arrows shot straight at the slender figure in the center of the battlefield. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ye Qingtang looked at the allied soldiers who had collapsed around her in a moaning heap. With a completely calm face, she suddenly raised her head and looked at the horizon. The arrows were flying towards her as thick as rain, but her lips arched slightly in an imperceptible smile.

Ye Qingtang slowly took a step forward. Although it looked like a casual step, the moment her heel touched the ground, a whirlwind abruptly arose!

This was the first time she was using the Jiang Family’s movement techniques. Although it could not compare to the immense power generated when Jiang Yu took a step, to the people in this world, it was savage.

The moment the whirlwind swept skywards, the ten thousand arrows were swept straight into the whirlwind. The arrows were torn into pieces by the violent wind, and not one could break through the spinning whirlwind.

“How... is this possible?!” The commander of the allied forces widened his eyes. Seven thousand arrows had been fragmented in a blink of an eye?

What kind of joke was this!

“Where’s the black witch? Use your witchcraft to kill her!” The commander of the allied forces looked utterly grim. There were fifty thousand soldiers ready just to conquer the Kingdom Fortress. He certainly would not permit this little devil to affect the army’s morale.
