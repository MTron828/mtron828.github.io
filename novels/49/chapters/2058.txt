Chapter 2059: Little You Yun (4)

Ye Qingtang remained still. She had no idea how to free Little You Yun short of destroying all the pagodas. So she could only wait for little Luo Xue to make a move.

It seemed like he knew how to deal with it.

He did not react at all even as he was thrown a few steps back. He moved forward again as a strong force appeared all around him.

With strong force, Little Luo Xue broke right through the barrier and grabbed her wrist. In the next second, the force around Little Luo Xue destroyed the light surrounding her!

Ye Qingtang was speechless.

Ning Luo had no words as well.

Even though Divine King Luo Xue had been reborn, this amount of power was absurd.

“Let’s go.” Little Luo Xue wrapped Little You Yun gently in his arms as though he was holding the world’s most precious pearl.

Ye Qingtang quickly regained her senses. She took out a coat from her space ring and lay it over Little You Yun.

Little Luo Xue was puzzled.

“To prevent people from noticing her,” She made up something with a straight face.

Little Luo Xue didn’t suspect her at all since he was completely loyal to the Ancient You Clan.

Ye Qingtang suddenly felt grateful that she had brought You Qiong along. Without him, she would never have been able to pose as Elder Mo and trick this little kid here.

Now that they had saved Little You Yun, Ning Luo and her wasted no time at all and left the pagoda immediately.

As Ye Qingtang was posing as Elder Mo and Little Luo Xue was a well-known weapon of the Ancient You Clan, no one batted an eye as they walked down the streets.

She discreetly asked Ning Luo to get You Qiong. He rushed over just to turn pale as he looked at the Little Luo Xue beside her.

“He...”

The Ancient You Clan had started raising youths after he returned and the strongest of them all was standing right in front of him.

However...

Why was he standing beside her?

“Warden Qiong, now that we have started the battle, we need to move her to a safe place as soon as possible.” Ye Qingtang gave him a look.

You Qiong was extremely smart and understood her intentions at once.

“Yes. We will follow Elder Mo’s words.”

The higher-ranked Elders had all gone into battle to deal with the Crimson League, leaving the underground world free. Since Elder Mo’s ranking was the highest there now, they could walk around freely.

They were going to seize this opportunity to sneak Little You Yun and Little Luo Xue out.

However...

“We’re leaving by the secret passage,” Little Luo Xue said as he looked at the main door.

Secret passage?

Ye Qingtang and You Qiong looked at each other in surprise. They had no idea where it was. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Nevertheless...

“You should walk ahead. I will observe you from the back in case anyone is following us,” she said without missing a beat.

Without thinking too much, Little Luo Xue turned around and started walking towards the secret passage.

They followed behind him.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang was glad that he was so young and that he had been so thoroughly brainwashed by the Ancient You Clan. Another normal adult wouldn’t have believed her.

The secret passage was well-hidden, and if not for Little Luo Xue leading the way, they would never have found it.
