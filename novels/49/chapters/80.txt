Chapter 81: Cleansing (2)

Ye Qingtang had went through all the trouble of putting on tonight’s show; that included tying up all loose ends as well.

Moreover, in the past, after Ye You went to the Cloud-breakers, for a few years, she had never returned to the Ye household. Thus, it was very unlikely for her to find out about the Great Elder’s death in a short period of time.

And these few years would provide ample time for Ye Qingtang to strengthen her prowess.

“What?!” This time, the Great Elder was flabbergasted as he stared at Ye Qingtang. Never in his wildest dreams would he expect to meet his defeat at the hands of a runt like her.

“Great Elder, your crimes had put your head in a noose. Repent in the afterlife. I bid thee farewell.” Ye Qingtang couldn’t be bothered to chastise him any longer. She drew her sword from her waist and slit the Great Elder’s throat in the next instant.

The Great Elder still had that look of disbelief even at death’s door. His plans and ambition went down the drain like the blood from the slit in his throat. It was not till he drew his last breath, did the Second Elder finally chuck his lifeless body to the ground.

Even after witnessing the death of her nemesis by her own hands, Ye Qingtang felt nothing.

In this life, she had sworn to protect her loved ones and would never let any of the past tragedies happen again.

Although the Great Elder was executed, his death needed to remain a secret. Ye Ling and the Second Elder had prepared to dispose his body discreetly, not a trace should remain.

“Father, Uncle, could I leave the cover-up to your discretion? There’s still the appointment with his Lordship.” Ye Qingtang inquired.

Ye Ling gave a nod and as he observed his daughter’s demeanor, he felt elated and lonely at the same time.

He had this sentiment, that his daughter was suddenly all grown-up over this short period of time.

“You’ve matured, more than capable of handling yourself. I’m glad and I wish you all the best. Do remember to put your best foot forward when you meet his Lordship.” Ye Ling reminded her.

“Yes. Father” Ye Qingtang nodded in response.

Ye Ling gave her his brightest smile, but his attention was inevitably drawn to the little fellow glued to Ye Qingtang.

“About that….”

Ye Qingtang rubbed her temples as she related the whole incident of how she picked up the egg of a lightning drake.

Ye Ling and the Second Elder had never come across any draconic species, let alone a lightning drake, thus a drake turning into a dragonoid was a totally unknown attribute to them.

While listening in on their conversation, the little fellow, who was as energetic as a terrier at first, had its complexion turned pallid as time passed.

The host could not sustain its conscious any longer. If it should still remain in its body, that would surely bring about the host’s death.

“Mommy…Can I…. rest for a while?” The little fellow tugged at Ye Qingtang’s sleeves, while it looked longingly at her.

Ye Qingtang gave it a slight nod, though she could not comprehend its actual intention.

The little fellow buried its face in her bosom, cuddling up closer to her than before. Its glistening eyes reflected its yearning for a mother’s love.

“Mommy…. Do you like me?” With its innocent voice, came a question that bared its insecurity. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

However, Ye Ling and the Second Elder were relieved by its reliance shown towards Ye Qingtang instead. Judging by its display of monstrosity earlier, with it staying by her side, she would be well protected in times of danger.

Ye Qingtang could neither laugh nor cry at her current situation. She never knew why this little fellow was so infatuated with her, but nonetheless she nodded to its question.

“Yeah.”

Immediately, the little fellow was thrilled.

Just that simple answer had brought all butterflies and rainbows to its world.

“Me too! Mommy! I like you the best~”

It looked forward to the day it could become mommy’s real child!

Just after it voiced that innocent remark, the little fellow suddenly turned into a glowing beacon. And when the glow dissipated, the chubby little fellow was nowhere to be seen. In its place however, was the hatchling of a drake covered in dark blue scales, resting peacefully within Ye Qingtang’s bosom.
