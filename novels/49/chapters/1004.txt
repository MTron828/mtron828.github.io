Chapter 1005 Yang Lord (2)

“Grand… Grand Master…”

Even the Grand Master, who was a Yin Yang Perfected Lord, also kneeled down in front of her. Seeing this, Long Rui had an extremely pale face.

Only at this moment did the Long Family understand what they had done. They offended a Yang Lord…

“There will be no more Long Family and Duan Family from now on.” Ye Qingtang scanned through everyone and said slowly after killing the Elder.

“Please spare us… We did not know!!”

The Long Family was in a mess after hearing their death sentence from Ye Qingtang.

However, an aura exploded suddenly. Ten people of the Long Family, including the Long Family Master, were killed instantly.

“Run!”

The Duan Family Master turned back and was about to flee in fear after witnessing the hell-like scene.

“Where do you want to go now that you’re already here?”

Ye Qingtang spoke plainly.

As Ye Qingtang finished her sentence, everyone from the Duan Family suddenly froze as if they lost control of their bodies.

Ye Qingtang wandered around them. She raised her right arm slightly, and the Duan Family Master’s body suddenly exploded.

Members of the Duan Family were all killed under Ye Qingtang’s martial aura within a few breaths.

The senior members of the Ye Family and a few Elders all froze in shock. Even Ye Ling also could not process what was going on.

“Qingtang… Tang Tang… Please… Please don’t kill me!” Duan Tianrao begged in fear as Ye Qingtang walked towards him slowly.

Boom!

Ye Qingtang did not even say a single word. Duan Tianrao’s body was crushed into a pool of flesh with an explosion.

However, Ye Qingtang did not kill some disciples of the Duan Family who kneeled and begged in front of her. She had nothing to do with the juniors, and they were just here to witness the drama. Ye Qingtang would not kill them since they did not have the intention to harm her.

Ye Qingtang did not plan to kill the Long Family’s, Duan Family’s, and Qinglin Sect’s Grand Elder straight away.

However, Ye Qingtang understood that these people not only wanted to take away the resources she gave to the Ye Family but also wanted to wipe out the entire Ye Family. They even had the intention to kill her. Ye Qingtang did not show any mercy and killed them all.

Ye Qingtang took a glimpse at the disciples of the Duan Family and let them leave the place. She did the same thing to some of the disciples of the Long Family.

After a short while, Ye Qingtang looked towards the senior members of the Ye Family and said, “Just now, I heard that you wanted to punish me with the family rules.”

The senior members’ faces all turned pale after Ye Qingtang finished her words.

They treated Ye Qingtang as a normal member of the Ye Family previously…

Under everyone’s gaze, Ye Qingtang swung a palm out and smashed the senior member whose arm was chopped off by her previously.

“Ah…”

The remaining senior members were all soaked with cold sweat.

“You only thought of how to protect yourselves when the Ye Family was facing our enemies. None of you cared about the honor of the family, and none of you deserve to live anymore.” Ye Qingtang looked towards the senior members of the Ye Family and said indifferently.

Based on her father Ye Ling’s personality, he was not able to control these senior members previously as well.

Ye Ling’s martial ability was mediocre and had a weak personality. It was hard for him to take up the position as the family master. Now, Ye Qingtang had to step out for deterrence.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m
