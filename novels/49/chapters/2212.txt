Even though Ye Qing’s elixir was showing some results, Di Nuo still did not believe that the elixir could fully heal Zhang Qiqiu’s bloodline.

The Vice-President smiled. “Ye Qing is not a bad person by nature, and Zhang Qiqiu’s bloodline has improved. Why would he need to flee?”

With that, the Vice-President ordered someone to have Ye Qing come to meet them. But after a short while, he received some news.

Not long after leaving the Vice-President’s quarters, Ye Qing had left the Netherworld Academy.

The Vice-President could no longer maintain the smile on his face.

Di Nuo had an “I told you so” look.

“Vice-President, you were too kind-hearted. We don’t know Ye Qing’s background. He was only in the academy for a short while before stirring up so much trouble. How can you trust someone like him?”

The Vice-President frowned slightly. He didn’t expect Ye Qing to leave.

And he had just started to place his trust in the youth.

Not only had Ye Qing left the Netherworld Academy, but she had also brought Lei Yan and the rest along with her. This situation had gone beyond the Vice-President’s expectations.

Ye Qing’s departure could be explained by a guilty escape from his offense. But bringing along that bunch of teenagers? What did that mean?

“Vice-President, Ye Qing is not an upright person. Those students were seduced and controlled by him. Who knows what kind of dire incident would come out of that? I advise Vice-President to immediately send out men to capture Ye Qing back to the academy.”

Independently leaving the academy with his students in tow, and at a time like this. One truly couldn’t help thinking there might be something nefarious behind his actions.

Although the Netherworld Academy already wanted to kick those students out, before that officially happened, they were still a part of the academy. If they created any trouble outside, wouldn’t it be a smear on the Netherworld Academy’s reputation?

The Vice-President realized the gravity of the situation, and he couldn’t help giving a soft sigh.

“I will let you handle this matter.”

Di Nuo immediately nodded.

“Yes.”

With that, Di Nuo left. Within half an hour, the Netherworld Academy issued a warrant for Ye Qing.

...

Meanwhile, Ye Qingtang and her group had already started their training journey and had no idea what was happening. How could Ye Qingtang have been aware that leading a training excursion for those few brats would end up being twisted into a scenario where she had seduced those students...

And she was now on the wanted list.

In reality, there was no problem for teachers leading their students out of the campus for training, but they had to report it first. Ye Qingtang had never been a teacher and had no idea about such regulations.

Moreover...

Since Ye Qingtang was not an official teacher and didn’t have the right to lead students out on a training excursion...

Ye Qingtang did not know any of this. At this moment, she was leading those teenagers past the mountains toward her destination.

“Where is Boss bringing us? This route seems different from the usual ones.” Lei Yan surveyed the surroundings, which were growing increasingly barren. He looked very curious.

Amongst them, only Qin Feng had gone outside for a training excursion led by a teacher. Lei Yan couldn’t help looking at Qin Feng

After that fight with Qin Xuan, the relationship between the teenagers had become much more harmonious. Especially for Qin Feng.

At least... Lei Yan was not as fearful of Qin Feng as before.

Qin Feng replied to Lei Yan with just a slight shake of his head.

How in the world would he know where Ye Qing was taking them? This teacher’s way of thinking was quite different from most teachers.
