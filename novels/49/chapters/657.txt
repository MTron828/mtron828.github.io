Ye Qingtang was in utter disbelief as she stared at the black-robed person before her.

She had thought of everyone, but she never thought that it would actually be him…

“Qingtang, it’s been a long time,” the elderly said gently with a smile.

“I did not expect it to actually be you… Grand Elder.” Ye Qingtang’s heart was rather complicated as she looked at that familiar face.

This black-robed person was none other than Xuanling Sect’s Grand Elder…

“Qingtang, you still found out eventually.” Venerable Wu smiled after remaining silent for a moment.

“I should have realized a long time ago.” Ye Qingtang looked at the Grand Elder and continued. “Back when I pretended to be Blood Moon Sect’s Guardian, you exposed my identity with one sentence… Initially, I thought that you accidentally let it slip, but thinking about it now, I’m afraid you did it deliberately.”

“Grand Elder, the annihilation of Xuanling Sect should also be part of your plan right…” Ye Qingtang added.

The Grand Elder did not deny it. “Qingtang, you’re a really big wild card… Actually, according to the original plan, the Hell of Avicinarak would only start a few years later. However, you exposed Fu Lingtian’s identity and caused him to drag Ning Luo in… Thus, the annihilation of the sect had to be brought forward.”

“Grand Elder, you’re truly evil… You sacrificed so many innocent lives from Xuanling Sect just for this so-called plan!” Ye Qingtang said angrily. “Only by making Yunxiao Sect aware that Xuanling Sect knows of their scheme in seizing others’ spirit roots would they want to silence Xuanling Sect… And only when Xuanling Sect is annihilated would the inheritance mystic realm that belongs solely to Xuanling Sect become an owner-less mystic realm. This will allow everyone to let down their guard and enter the Hundred Level Peril Hell of Avincinaraka defenseless. Grand Elder, you calculated and schemed this really well!”

The Grand Elder laughed coldly. “You still barely saved Xuanling Sect.”

“That’s right.” Ye Qingtang said and nodded. “I pretended to be a Blood Moon Guardian and brought the Blood Moon Sect members to the sect. I originally hoped that it could resolve the sect’s crisis, but you exposed my identity at the most inappropriate timing. Everything you did is for the events to happen according to your plan.”

“Qingtang, you’re indeed very intelligent.” Venerable Wu nodded and seemed to be rather gratified. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Never had I expected that the person who caused Xuanling Sect to be annihilated to be you, Xuanling Sect’s Grand Elder… I wish to ask, when you saw those Xuanling Sect disciples who willingly gave up their lives in order to protect the sect, did your ruthless heart ache?!”

After hearing Ye Qingtang’s words, the Grand Elder was slightly taken aback. His calm eyes, however, had some fluctuations.

The scene from that day still lingered in the mind …

It was as though he could still hear the screams of those hot-blooded boys.

“Grand Elder, you used Xuanling Sect’s blood for your ruthless plan. Does your heart really not hurt?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Qingtang, don’t say any more rubbish.” The Grand Elder waved a hand and interrupted her. “I have been in Xuanling Sect since I was seven. I’ve been Xuanling Sect’s Sect Master and subsequently the Grand Elder. No one would have deeper feelings for Xuanling Sect than me. However, this mainland will be destroyed sooner or later. Why not, then, make Xuanling Sect’s destruction be more meaningful.”
