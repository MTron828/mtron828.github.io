Ye Qingtang looked at the jade pearl in Feng Wuyin’s small palm. For some reason, she felt very conflicted as she looked at Feng Wuyin’s innocent little face and asked, “Wuyin, why are you so good to me?”

Feng Wuyin smiled shyly after hearing Ye Qingtang’s words. “Sister Ye Yue, you saved Brother Jiuyou… also, Sister Ye Yue is so good-looking… Sister Ye Yue, when I become stronger in the future, I’ll look for you in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain.”

Ye Qingtang was taken aback by Feng Wuyin’s words. “When you grow up… you want to look for me in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain? Why?”

Feng Wuyin rubbed his hands and looked at Ye Qingtang. His face flushed slightly. “Sister Ye Yue is so good-looking. When I grow up, I want to go to the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain and take Sister Ye Yue’s finger in marriage.”

Ye Qingtang, “…”

Reaching out, Ye Qingtang accepted the jade pearl that Feng Wuyin was offering her. “Alright, I will accept it.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The young Feng Jiuyou quickly walked up and stared at Feng Wuyin. He said with disdain, “What a fool! It should be to take her hand in marriage! Not her finger!”

Feng Wuyin tilted his head and pondered for a moment. He then nodded and said to Ye Qingtang again, “Yes, yes, yes… I’ll grow up and become an expert. Then I’ll go to the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain and take Sister Ye Yue’s finger… no… hand in marriage!”

Ye Qingtang could not help laughing when she saw Feng Wuyin’s expression.

Perhaps, at this young age, Feng Wuyin didn’t even know what marriage was. He probably didn’t understand the meaning of marriage. He was just being pure and open about what he liked.

This… was probably what real innocence looked like.

In her two lifetimes, Ye Qingtang had experienced countless schemes and plots. She did not know how long it had been since she met a young boy like Feng Wuyin.

“Fine, whatever. Look at how beautiful Sister Ye Yue is. I wanted to marry her myself when I grow up. Forget it, I’ll let you have her. Hurry up and cultivate to become stronger. If you’re always so weak, who would want to marry you?” Feng Jiuyou said seriously.

Feng Wuyin immediately nodded. “Sister Ye Yue, wait for me to become stronger first. I can’t protect you right now, I’m too weak and can only defeat Brother Jiuyou. I can’t defeat anyone else.”

Ye Qingtang, “…”

“Pfft!” Feng Jiuyou was unconvinced. “So what? I can become stronger too. You won’t be able to defeat me in the future!”

Before Feng Jiuyou could say anything, Feng Wuyin’s expression changed. “Oh no! My parents told me to go to the market to buy things, but I forgot!”

With that, Feng Wuyin pulled Ye Qingtang’s sleeve. “Sister Ye Yue… Can you come with me?”

“Alright.” Ye Qingtang agreed without hesitation. She had never been to the market before.

“Tl go too… Sigh, this won’t do. My parents won’t let me go out today. They said that I can’t go anywhere until my sword skills ascend another level…” Feng Jiuyou pursed his lips.

“Brother Jiuyou, stay at home then. We’ll be back soon. Wait for our return. I’ll bring you something nice to eat,” Feng Wuyin said.

With that, Ye Qingtang left the Feng family residence with Feng Wuyin.

The market here was different from ordinary markets. There were all sorts of items being sold here. Furthermore, there were all sorts of people here as well.

When they arrived at the market, Feng Wuyin widened his eyes and looked around. Before long, he returned to Ye Qingtang’s side with two candied fruits.

“Sister Ye Yue, this is for you.”
