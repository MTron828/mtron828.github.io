Chapter 2297: A Gamble (4)

Di Nuo’s expression shifted again. He did not expect Ye Qing to put up such a desperate fight.

But thinking of the bet again, Di Nuo relaxed.

There was no need for him to haggle with such a useless person. Right from the start, Ye Qing was destined to lose this bet.

“Alright, I agree.” Di Nuo put on a show of nodding graciously. He added the terms to the contract and both parties gave their thumbprints. They also left their mental imprint on each contract, before keeping their own copies.

“Vice-President and Teacher Luo Sheng are both witnesses to this bet. I will have peace of mind then. Farewell.” Di Nuo shot Ye Qing a chilly look before hurrying away.

Yes, he would give him three more days to struggle. After that, when the Inter-Academy Competition selection began, he would have him crawl like a dog out of the Netherworld Academy in front of everyone!

After Di Nuo left, Ye Qingtang also prepared to leave. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Wen Qi glanced at Ye Qing as if he wanted to say something. But in the end, he remained silent.

“Ye Qing, let’s walk out together.” Luo Sheng spoke up after noticing Wen Qi’s expression.

Ye Qingtang nodded.

After the two of them left the Vice-President’s lodgings, Luo Sheng couldn’t resist a sigh.

“Ye Qing, you acted too rashly this time.”

Ye Qingtang looked at Luo Sheng’s exasperated expression. She remained silent.

Luo Sheng continued. “The Vice-President already had plans regarding today’s matter. You did flout the academy rules but we thought that as long as you admitted that you were in the wrong, even if you can no longer become a proper teacher here, you would not have to leave…”

Ye Qingtang was somewhat surprised by Luo Sheng’s words.

Luo Sheng patted Ye Qingtang on the shoulder. Similar to the Vice-President, he had high regard for Ye Qing’s deep understanding of martial arts. While he might not be suitable to become a teacher, he was still a talent.

“After you admitted your mistake, the Vice-President planned to remove your status as a teacher. But even so, you could have continued to stay on in the academy as a warden. The Vice-President had everything all planned out nicely. He would keep you by his side to research martial arts. But you… sigh.”

Luo Sheng couldn’t resist sighing again.

It could be said that Wen Qi truly admired Ye Qing’s abilities. Otherwise, he would not have come up with such a comprehensive plan for him.

But no one expected things to turn out this way.

Wen Qi still had the President to answer to, so he could not go against academy regulations and pretend nothing happened. But he had already come up with a lifeline for Ye Qing.

But in the end, Ye Qing made such a bet with Di Nuo. Even if Wen Qi wanted to keep him, it was impossible.

“Teacher Luo Sheng, please help me thank the Vice-President. I appreciate his kind intentions,” Ye Qingtang said.

Ye Qingtang respected Wen Qi a lot. But his plans for her were not what she desired.

“You punk. You are still young but already so stubborn… sigh. Never mind, the die is cast. You still have three days, you… should make the necessary preparations.” Luo Sheng shook his head with another sigh.

He was not asking Ye Qing to prepare for the Inter-Academy Competition. After all, the terms of Ye Qing’s bet were just too ridiculous.

He had six students under him and all of them had to be selected for the Inter-Academy Competition. This was just one big joke.

What he had to prepare for now was how to handle the humiliation he would be forced to endure in three days. Also… how to explain to Lei Yan and the others that they would be kicked out of the Netherworld Academy.
