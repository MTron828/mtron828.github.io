Chapter 1996: Truth and Lies (3)

Even though the Holy Lord of Shadows and her had been at odds for the longest time, she couldn’t deny that the Holy Lord of Shadows had always kept her word.

“Hmph, I’ll give you one last chance to defend yourself.” Bai Zhi scoffed and took out a voice transmission stone. She drew a border with her hand so Ye Qingtang and the rest couldn’t hear her and seemed to be using it to contact the other two of the alien race.

The Demon Tribe Leader twisted his mouth in contempt as he looked at Bai Zhi talking to her comrades.

“I think the Crimson League is probably trying to push the blame onto us. I saw with my own two eyes the Holy Lord placing the Netherworld Ring into the box and instructing Xue Fu to go with it. How could it not have arrived in the Frost Abyss yet?”

The other tribe leaders were all thinking the same thing.

Although Ye Qingtang didn’t say anything, she was secretly overjoyed. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Seeing that Bai Zhi had come here personally, the Ancient You Clan must have succeeded. If nothing else went wrong, Xue Fu and the rest should be coming back to the Temple of Shadows soon...

The show was just about to begin.

She had thrown in many Dharma treasures to ensure that the Ancient You Clan would believe that it was the real Netherworld Ring. She hoped that they wouldn’t let her down.

Bai Zhi brought down the border after a while and threw them an impassive glance. L

Thinking that she had already received the Netherworld Ring, the Demon Tribe Leader was about to speak. But in the next second, Bai Zhi had flung Lady Ghost towards Ye Qingtang.

She quickly raised her hand and saved her.

The eight tribe leaders all watched on tensely.

“Bai Zhi, what are you doing!”

“What?” Bai Zhi laughed in anger as she lifted her chin slightly and looked at Ye Qingtang.

“Mo Yao, I really misjudged you. I didn’t think that you would learn how to lie so smoothly after going to the First Domain...” Bai Zhi’s eyes changed as she continued,

“No one has sent the Netherworld Ring to the Frost Abyss and my comrades haven’t received any ring! What else do you have to say!”

Seeing that Bai Zhi was about to cause mass destruction, Ye Qingtang broke out in cold sweat. If she were to let loose here, she was afraid that Ming Di was probably the only one who could deal with her.

Xue Fu, please don’t let me down. Hurry back!

Right at this critical moment, a pathetic figure suddenly appeared in the main hall.

Ye Qingtang’s heart leaped with joy as she saw the people approaching.

My savior! You came just in time!

A downtrodden Xue Fu rushed into the main hall and saw the angry Bai Zhi ready to attack.

He froze in shock.

“Guardian Xue Fu! You came back right in time. Tell this crazy woman... Lady Bai Zhi that you’ve already sent it to the Frost Abyss,” the Demon Tribe Leader said.

The Goblin Tribe spoke up as well.

“Lady Bai Zhi, please calm down. I instructed Guardian Xue Fu to deliver the Netherworld Ring himself. He’s back now and can tell you so himself.”

A suspicious glint appeared in Bai Zhi’s eyes as she observed the group of people, but she decided to wait and see. What other excuses could they cook up? They couldn’t run anyway.

“You’ve delivered the Netherworld Ring?” Bai Zhi turned to ask Xue Fu.

Xue Fu’s face was white. He looked at Bai Zhi and then back at Ye Qingtang and without saying a word, ran towards her.

“Holy Lord, I deserve to die! The Netherworld Ring and the other Dharma treasures were stolen by the Ancient You Clan on the way to the Frost Abyss!”
