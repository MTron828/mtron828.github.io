Chapter 916 The Divine Phoenix’s Trial (1)

“Absolute Monarch of Heaven…”

After they recognized the man, the person’s face changed slightly.

Absolute Monarch of Heaven was one of the extraordinary talents of the younger generation in Central Mainland. He possessed outstanding talents and was ranked near the top of the Honor Roll List.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes followed everyone’s line of sight and slowly landed on the Absolute Monarch of Heaven. When she saw the face of the man, Ye Qingtang was stunned.

The purple-haired man before her was so familiar…

In Ye Qingtang’s previous life, she became sworn siblings with six brothers, one of whom was the Absolute Monarch of Heaven before her!

Ye Qingtang never thought that she would meet the Absolute Monarch of Heaven at this place.

As she looked at him sitting cross-legged by the stream and his long, purple hair dancing in the wind bewitchingly, reminiscence filled her.

Memories of the time spent with the six sworn brothers flooded her mind.

Those were the few memories from her past life that were worth looking back on.

Although many scenes filled her mind, Ye Qingtang quickly looked away at this instant.

In this life, she did not have any relations with the Absolute Monarch of Heaven yet, and he was not her sworn brother. It was thus better to not look at him for too long or else it would arouse the suspicion of the Absolute Monarch of Heaven.

“Haha, I was wondering who it was. So it is the Absolute Monarch of Heaven… However, Absolute Monarch of Heaven, how do you know so much?” The man in black armor looked at Absolute Monarch of Heaven and asked with a smile.

However, Absolute Monarch of Heaven no longer gave any response. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The man in black armor did not gain any reply, and he did not say anything more either.

“When is the trial starting…”

At this instant, many powerful figures exchanged a look. The Divine Phoenix spoke just now, but it was only one sentence, and it did not make any sound again after that.

Currently, no one could give any answers, and the only thing they could do was to wait. As for when they had to wait until, no one was clear. After all, the Divine Phoenix did not give any more hints.

Ye Qingtang was not anxious. Seeing that the trial for the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix had not opened, she was not as restless as the others. Instead, she found a quiet place to sit and consolidate her martial cultivation.

No one could conjecture the Divine Phoenix’s meaning. Since that was the case, all she needed to do was to wait patiently and not waste energy

Presently, Ye Qingtang’s martial cultivation had already entered the Yin Yang Perfected Lord Third Heaven and was steadily advancing towards Yin Yang Perfected Lord Fourth Heaven. In no time, she could make a breakthrough to the Fourth Heaven.

Time ticked away. The bright sky turned dark and back bright again. This cycle continued for about half a month.

As time passed, every minute became unknowing torture to the people within the screen.

For the entire half a month, the Divine Phoenix never appeared.

The patience of the people awaiting the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix eroded away bit by bit.

No one knew exactly when the trial for the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix would begin. Remaining within the screen, it was as though they were waiting for a destiny so far in the indefinite future. They did not have any clue about it and did not know its deadline.

In this half a month, some cultivators ran out of patience and left the land of inheritance halfway. However, when they returned and tried to step into the screen again, they were isolated outside and could no longer enter the screen at all.

Everyone understood the current situation. Once anyone of them left the land of inheritance, it would be impossible for them to enter it again. Yet, even if they remained in the land of inheritance, the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix did not appear.
