Chapter 997 Ability (3)

After seeing Clan Master Long’s reaction, the senior members of the Ye Family had a change of expression, and one of them hurriedly spoke.

However, Clan Master Long was unmoved. Duan Tianrao took a step forward, and his eyes swept across Ye Qingtang and the members of the Ye Family as though he was looking at ants. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“The Ye family offended Lord Long. I’m afraid whatever you say now is useless…” Duan Tianrao said.

The Third Elder was appalled, and he looked at Duan Tianrao. “Tianrao, no matter what, you used to be Ye Qingtang’s fiancé. Quickly persuade Lord Long…”

Currently, the Third Elder was panic-stricken and clearly could not think through what could be said and what could not.

Indeed, Long Rui’s expression darkened instantly after hearing what the Third Elder said.

Duan Tianrao shook his head. “The engagement between Ye Qingtang and I had already been broken two years ago. Our engagement back then was none other than an error made by my father at the spur of the moment. My father believed that in Lin Town, only Ye Qingtang was suited to be the future Mistress of the Duan Family. There were no feelings between Ye Qingtang and me. Moreover, given Ye Qingtang’s martial skills and talent, how is it possible for her to be the Mistress of the Duan Family… You mentioned this incident simply to insult me on purpose!”

“This…”

The Third Elder was dumbstruck. What he said was due to the urgency of the situation, and he completely did not think that Long Rui was still present and that such words would only achieve the opposite effect.

“If there’s anything, blame it on the fact that your Ye family produced an ignorant and arrogant Eldest Young Lady with plain martial skills. She thought she was unbeatable after gaining a great treasure. How ridiculous!” Duan Tianrao cast Ye Qingtang a cold look.

After Duan Tianrao said that, Clan Master Duan and other members of the Duan family marched into the Ye residence’s courtyard.

After learning that the Clan Master of the Long Family went to the Ye residence, Duan Yangjing, who was previously humiliated, carelessly treated his injuries and hurriedly led a group of people from the Duan Family over. He wanted to see exactly what kind of Dharma treasure Ye Qingtang had and all the more wanted to see the outcome of Ye Qingtang and the Ye Family!

“How lively it is today.” Ye Qingtang looked at the Long and Duan Family and laughed softly.

“Humph, Ye Qingtang, You will definitely die today!” Duan Yangjing looked at Ye Qingtang coldly, wanting to shred Ye Qingtang into millions of pieces.

Nonetheless, Ye Qingtang could not even be bothered to reply to the Duan Family.

“Ye Qingtang, hurry! Kneel down and admit your mistake! Do you really want to harm us and the Ye Family!!”

“Ye Qingtang, you bastard! Hurry up and apologize by taking your own life!!”

Several senior members of the Ye Family seemed to still be a little hopeful as they hollered at Ye Qingtang in fury, as though the Long Family would let them off as long as Ye Qingtang died.

At this instant, they could not care about Ye Qingtang’s life.

“Even if she apologized by taking her life, it is useless,” Clan Master Long said calmly. His martial aura did not reduce a bit and instead became even stronger.

Under this overwhelming aura, the members of the Ye Family were aghast, and their faces were as pale as those of corpses. It was as though their bodies were pressed down by a giant mountain in the skies, and they were unable to move.

“Full of bullsh*t.” Ye Qingtang looked at Clan Master Long and said coldly.

“Insolent bastard, you have a death wish!” Clan Master Long shouted coldly and subsequently walked towards Ye Qingtang.

Swoosh!

A superior yellow-grade sword with a magical luster was unsheathed by Clan Master Long
