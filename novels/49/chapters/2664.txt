Chapter 2665 Devouring The Sun (2)

At this moment, somewhere in the valley.

The Paragon frowned deeply and said to Ye Qingtang, “Sister Ye Yue, look. There’s a dog on the sun.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Ye Qingtang was stunned. What did the Paragon just say… did she hear wrongly?

A dog on the sun?

Almost instinctively, Ye Qingtang looked towards the horizon… and she was completely stunned by what she saw.

A dog devouring the sun?!

No, no, no…

It wasn’t the act of devouring the sun which shocked Ye Qingtang, but the dog itself!

“That dog?” Ye Qingtang stared at the sky in a daze.

Wasn’t that the big yellow dog?!

Ye Qingtang did hear that th to try and devour the sun when it first came to the lower realm. But Ye Qingtang always thought it was just a joke…

Now, Ye Qingtang was seeing it with her own

eyes!

Not only that, it was triggering a destructive natural disaster as it was gnawing at the sun!

Ye Qingtang never expected that she would witness the very moment when the big yellow dog first arrived in the lower realm.

However, Ye Qingtang could not understand why the big yellow dog was in the Divine Venerate Domain when it first arrived in the lower realm. Didn’t she find it sleeping in the Wailing Well in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain?!

“That demonic dog… just who is it? It possesses such mystical abilities…” The Paragon stared at the big yellow dog with a frown.

Ye Qingtang, “…”

“Sister Ah Yao, that’s just a dog,” Ye Qingtang said after a while.

The Paragon shook her head. “Sister Ye Yue,

how can that be an ordinary dog? We don’t know how far away it is from us now, but it can trigger a natural disaster powerful enough to reach us. Just the sight of it makes me shudder.”

Ye Qingtang, “…”

Even though the big yellow dog seemed to be harmless and would follow Ye Qingtang every day in the future era, the truth was that the big yellow dog was indeed from the upper realm. Ye Qingtang did not know how powerful it was.

In her era, Ye Qingtang did not have the chance to personally witness the yellow dog’s peak and glory.

Now, Ye Qingtang finally had some idea of the yellow dog’s skills.

Before Ye Qingtang could ponder further, endless fireballs rained down again. She wished she could shout at the yellow dog to stop going against the sun. She had beef jerky with her.

“Sister Ye Yue, let’s go!”

The Paragon grabbed Ye Qingtang. It was not safe to stay here.

Apart from Han Cangming, who was nowhere to be found, there was also the endless rain of fireballs. It was too dangerous.

Swoosh!

Just as the Paragon was dodging fireballs with Ye Qingtang, Han Cangming suddenly flew out from the thick smoke and struck the Paragon’s left shoulder.

The Paragon was forced back dozens of steps by Han Cangming.

In the next second, Han Cangming grabbed Ye Qingtang and hid in a cloud, disappearing without a trace.

“Sister Ye Yue!”

The Paragon cried out when she saw that. She instinctively wanted to give chase, but a few more fireballs fell from the sky. The Paragon had no choice but to dodge the fireballs.

After dodging the fireballs, there was no longer any sign of Han Cangming and Ye Qingtang. There was no one around.
