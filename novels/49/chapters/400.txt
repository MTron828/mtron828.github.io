Chapter 401: In-Name Disciple (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang never expected Elder Mo to say that and was stunned there and then.

Elder Mo wished to accept her as an in-name disciple?!

Ye Qingtang was dumbfounded.

Everyone chuckled when they saw that Ye Qingtang was stunned. They thought that Ye Qingtang was surprised by this delightful event that fell from the sky and was too elated.

Little did they know that…

Ye Qingtang felt very complicated.

She was aware that Elder Mo’s state of cultivation in Xuanling Sect was very high, and his guidance was important to ordinary disciples.

However…

Ye Qingtang was a soul who had lived for three hundred years. Although she did not have a spirit root in her previous life, she had cultivated for hundreds of years, and thus her martial arts attainments were simply not below that of others. Even for Elder Mo, whose skills were pretty good currently, there was nothing he knew that she did not, and even… what she knew was probably more than Elder Mo.

What she needed was merely time and the upgrading of her spirit root.

As for becoming apprenticed to a master…

To Ye Qingtang, it was really not essential.

However, looking at everyone’s expression that read “what a good thing, accept it quickly,” her heart was even more complicated.

Elder Mo had already asked in public, and if she rejected straight up, it was not giving him face. Furthermore, she felt that Elder Mo had a pretty good character. Ye Qingtang pondered: if she really became Elder Mo’s in-name disciple, when the mystic realm opened and her skills were higher, the possibility of Elder Mo nominating her would be greater.

Then, Ye Qingtang did not think anything else any further. Anyway, she was not expecting Elder Mo to guide her on anything and only treated it as a preparation for entering the mystic realm in the future, plus going along with everyone’s “expectations.” Bowing to Elder Mo, Ye Qingtang said, “It is my blessing to be able to gain Elder Mo’s blessing. I am willing to be your disciple.”

Elder Mo nodded slightly. Ye Qingtang’s reply was what he expected. For a disciple who just entered the inner sect, being able to gain an elder’s recognition was naturally an extremely joyous matter.

“You must cultivate diligently in the future. Do not waste your youth.”

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang replied obediently. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“I still have something on. I’ll leave first,” Elder Mo told Ye Qingtang. When he saw the elderly who was grinning from ear to ear from the corner of his eye, he could only sigh helplessly.

This person was really attentive to Ye Qingtang.

“Disciple sees Master off,” Ye Qingtang said.

Elder Mo exited the Sword Spirit Workshop immediately.

Ye Qingtang wanted to leave as well but was suddenly blocked by the beaming elderly.

“Senior?”

“Little girl, how does it feel to be Elder Mo’s in-name disciple?” The elderly smiled.

Ye Qingtang was rather speechless but remained happy on her face.

The elderly touched his mustached and chuckled. “Little girl, I brought Elder Mo here for you. Shouldn’t you thank me?”

Ye Qingtang was slightly taken aback. She still had not figured out who this elderly was. The incharge and Elder Mo both were respectful to him, and this could not help but pique her curiosity on who this person was.

Could it be the Grand Elder?

This thought suddenly arose but was brushed away by Ye Qingtang.

The Grand Elder was extremely mysterious, and even if he was related to the Sword Spirit Workshop, it was not to the extent for him to be here so frequently.

“Thank you, senior.” Ye Qingtang replied respectfully without over-thinking.

The senior nodded in satisfaction, though his eyes twinkled. “Little girl, it is not enough to just mouth your thanks. Shouldn’t you give some real thing?” Afterward, he even winked at Ye Qingtang.
