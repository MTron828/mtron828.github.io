Chapter 2318: Their Best Hope (2)

“Good luck, show them what we are made of.” Gong Jinyun also stepped forward to offer some encouragement.

The number eight teenager added. “You are our best hope now.”

Ran Mo blinked, feeling very confused.

But he had a simple way of thinking. He actually felt rather happy at the fact that he had been challenged. After all, since joining the academy, he had not had a chance to spar with anyone. It was incredibly frustrating.

When Ran Mo saw Qin Feng standing on the platform, he couldn’t help being taken aback. They had both joined the academy as superstars and had met each other a few times before.

“Qin Feng? It’s been a long time.” Ran Mo grinned, revealing two sharp teeth.

Qin Feng nodded politely in return.

A major battle was about to commence. These two teenagers were already famous when they first joined the academy. To think that they were about to face off now.

“Qin Feng is so awesome. He wants to challenge Ran Mo? Boss, do you think Qin Feng will win?” Lei Yan was feeling very excited. This would be a true battle.

Ye Qingtang didn’t speak. In all honesty, she did not know much about Ran Mo.

Soon after, the sound of drums started and the battle between those two officially started.

The earlier battles by Lei Yan and the rest had just been one-sided affairs. This match between Qin Feng and Ran Mo would be extraordinarily exciting and intense.

Qin Feng had drawn his Sword of Destruction. When the two of them attacked, the entire area was nearly shattered by the aura exuded by the two on stage.

A First Heaven peak level had challenged a Second Heaven early stage. It was a bloody fight. No one denied that Qin Feng was powerful, but they felt he was too impetuous to challenge Ran Mo.

However, it was not the instant defeat the crowd had expected. Instead, they exchanged blows without any clear victor or loser. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

In terms of cultivation level, Ran Mo had the advantage. But Qin Feng’s moves were violent and brutal. They were completely different from what the other students had learned.

There were no unnecessary, fancy actions. They were all straightforward and lethal attacks.

In the beginning, Ran Mo had not been serious, but after he experienced the ferocity of Qin Feng’s moves, he instinctively began to give his all.

It was a spectacular battle. All the students and teachers were dumbstruck.

This was such an exciting match!

Without realizing it, all the teachers became engrossed in the fight and started to seriously analyze the differences between those two.

“Ran Mo’s spirit energy is thicker and the difference in cultivation level is clear.”

“But I feel that Qin Feng’s moves are more sharp and agile. Look at his punches and kicks, it’s so precise. It’s like he had undergone countless real-life battles…”

The two of them had their own good points. The teachers couldn’t help getting increasingly excited as they watched.

It was apparent that Ran Mo’s cultivation level was higher than Qin Feng’s, but Qin Feng’s moves had been honed by real blood and sweat in the Evil Soul Forest. They were completely different from those empty training actions which lacked substance in a real-life and death situation.

The two teenagers fought for a long time. Covered in wounds, they had exchanged over a hundred moves but there was still no clear winner.

All the teachers were waiting to see who would win. Ran Mo, who had a higher cultivation level, or Qin Feng, with his unorthodox moves.

At this point, a figure had quietly arrived at the arena. It was a man dressed in white with a long white beard. Standing apart from the crowd, he watched the two teenagers on the platform.

“That teenager is Qin Feng?” The elder asked.

A middle-aged man standing beside him nodded.

“That’s right. It’s Qin Feng.”

“Gu Wei mentioned this student to me before and said he had exceptional potential but suffered a decline. How is it that he is able to hold his own against Ran Mo?” An admiring glint flashed across the elder’s eyes.
