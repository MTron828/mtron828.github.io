“Brother Canine, say something. A brother for a day, a brother for a lifetime. Brother Canine, do you need a successor? To nurture a powerful figure or something… Did you know that humans are the most cunning race? Not many humans can be trusted. Do you need to groom a powerful human to serve you? Brother Canine, I’m the most suitable candidate. How about you groom me?!” The Blood Moon Elder hugged the big yellow dog tightly, looking like he was afraid that the big yellow dog would run away.

“Groom you?” The big yellow dog’s gaze slowly landed on the Blood Moon Elder. After sizing him up for a moment, he said, “I might as well train that little girl.”

The corners of Ye Qingtang’s lips curled up as she walked quickly to the yellow dog. “Master!”

The big yellow dog, “…”

These humans…

With Ye Qingtang’s experience from two lifetimes, how could she not know that the ability displayed by the big yellow dog just now had already completely surpassed the Emperor stage and reached an unprecedented level!

Immortal Emperor level was at the top of the pyramid of the three domains. In fact, in her two lifetimes, this was the first time Ye Qingtang felt the power of an Immortal Emperor!

Ye Qingtang originally thought that the yellow dog would at most be at the Emperor level. However, Ye Qingtang did not expect that this dog was actually an Immortal Emperor, above the Emperor level.

How many Immortal Emperors were there in the three domains?

“I’m hungry. I want to eat beef jerky.” The big yellow dog shook its head and tail.

“Yes, yes, yes!” Ye Qingtang immediately took out some dry food from her space ring and fed it to the big yellow dog. “Come, I’ll feed you.”

After the big yellow dog finished eating all the dry food, it said, “Actually, I am very weak now. There are restrictions here… so it’s useless for you to suck up to me. The strength that I have accumulated over so many years is all gone now.”

“Brother Canine, what do you mean?” The Blood Moon Elder was baffled. He did not understand what the yellow dog meant when it said there were restrictions here. Even Ye Qingtang was baffled and did not understand the meaning of the yellow dog’s words.

Also, what did it mean by accumulated strength? As a dignified Immortal Emperor, did it still need to accumulate strength? Didn’t it have limitless power?

“Sigh, this place won’t do. The laws are too restrictive, and the accumulation of powers is very slow. I can’t fight with others next time. If the people above sense my existence, it will bring destruction to this world,” the big yellow dog continued. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The Blood Moon Elder slapped his thigh and said, “Brother Canine, that’s right. That’s why you can’t do everything yourself. That’s why you need the Holy Lady and me. Look… Groom the Holy Lady and let her do everything in the future. Let the Holy Lady fight whenever necessary. All will be fine then!”

Although the Blood Moon Elder did not know what the big yellow dog was talking about, he believed in what he was saying.

“Her?”

The big yellow dog glanced at Ye Qingtang. Its gaze landed on Ye Qingtang’s chest. After a moment of silence, it said, “Little girl, I’m afraid you have an extremely complicated background.”

“What do you mean by that?” Ye Qingtang frowned slightly. This was the second time that the big yellow dog tactfully mentioned her Heart of Heavenly Dao.

The Heart of Heavenly Dao had been sealed by the Divine Phoenix previously.. Judging from the time that had passed, the seal probably wouldn’t last long.
