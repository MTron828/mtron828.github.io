Chapter 2537: Killing An Immortal Emperor (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The instruction given to him by the Evil Deity Patriarch was that if a peak Immortal Emperor existed, everything would be fine. However, if it was a newly-ascended Immortal Emperor, he should be eliminated once he was seriously injured from undergoing the tribulation.

According to the natural laws of this place, it was very likely that he would fail in his attempt to break through to the Immortal Emperor level. He would definitely be extremely weak now, and this was the best opportunity to kill an Immortal Emperor.

“Everyone, come out. I believe we all have the same motive for coming here,” the white-haired old man said.

As the white-haired old man finished speaking, batch after batch of elite practitioners from the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain walked out from the shadows.

“So it’s Elder Long of the Dragon Emperor Clan. Nice to meet you.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

At that moment, a white-robed youth holding a golden feathered fan walked out from the shadows with a gentle smile. He clasped his fists and smiled at the white-haired old man.

“Sky Vault Sect’s First Prince.” The white-haired elder glanced indifferently at the youth holding the golden feathered fan.

“I didn’t expect Elder Long to remember a junior like me. I’m truly flattered.” The white-robed youth nodded slightly.

“Heh, it’s lively today.” On the other side, a woman in a red dress walked out from the darkness. She had a flushed face and an alluring appearance.

“Devil Cloud Sect?!”

Many practitioners were surprised to see the woman.

It was rumored that the Devil Cloud Sect came from the Third Domain and had migrated to the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain overnight. The Devil Cloud Sect Paragon was an elite practitioner who had once been sworn enemies with the Temple of Paragon. After that, for some unknown reason, the Devil Cloud Sect Paragon died in the Wailing Well. Recently, there was news that the Devil Cloud Sect Paragon had already been resurrected. As for whether it was true or false, no one knew.

After Devil Cloud Sect Paragon died, the red dress woman became the one in charge.

“The Devil Cloud Sect has already fallen eons ago. Why have they risen from the ashes now?”

A Six-Winged Fire Phoenix flapped its wings up in the sky. Elder Bai stood on its back and stared at the red dress woman. Apart from Elder Bai, there was also a man wearing a silver fox mask standing with his hands behind his back.

“Heh, what’s going on today? It’s really lively. Even the protectors and elders of the Temple of Paragon have been mobilized.” The red dress woman smiled gently.

“The Temple of Paragon.”

The white-haired elder of the Dragon Emperor Clan glanced at the Temple of Paragon indifferently. It was common knowledge that the relationship between the Dragon Emperor Clan and the Temple of Paragon had never been harmonious in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain.

The Temple of Paragon had a Paragon overseeing it, while the Dragon Emperor Clan had an Evil Deity overseeing it.

“I say, Temple of Paragon. The Dragon Emperor Clan is even more vicious than our Devil Cloud Sect, right? That’s a truly great evil sect in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain. Could it be that your Temple of Paragon isn’t interested in eradicating this evil sect? To clash with the Dragon Emperor Clan?” The red dress woman chuckled. Her appearance was extremely alluring, and her words were filled with a bewitching divine power.

The First Prince of the Sky Vault Sect smiled and waved his golden fan. He then glanced at the elder of the Dragon Emperor Clan.

Just as the woman in red had said, the Dragon Emperor Clan had once been an evil sect despised by the entire Mixed Heavens Holy Domain. The clan was besieged by many powerful factions, but the factions ended up suffering heavy losses after several attack attempts. In the end, they could only leave the matter at that.

A moment later, the white-haired elder of the Dragon Emperor Clan glanced at the red dress lady and asked, “When did the Demon Cloud Sect learn to sow discord?”

The white-haired elder from the Dragon Emperor Clan did not have a good impression of the Demon Cloud Sect.
