Chapter 982 Death Wish (3)

Ye Qingtang, who had been standing by the side all this while, could not help but be rendered speechless when she saw her father’s and the various elders’ mournful looks.

She could tell.

They thought that the Ye Family had lost the match.

However…

They had not even asked about it. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Father…” Ye Qingtang felt that she needed to have a good talk with her father about this matter.

But Ye Ling suddenly interrupted Ye Qingtang and said, “Tang Tang, you can see the current situation in the Ye Family. You should start your journey back to the Xuanling Sect today. You are not to concern yourself with whatever happens next. As your father, I only hope you can live peacefully within the sect.”

Even Dan Yifan was unable to turn the Ye Family’s current situation around. If Ye Qingtang continued to stay here, who knew how many other matters would arise for her to worry over?

“…” Could she just finish her sentence?

“Actually, in this match, our Ye Family…” Ye Qingtang continued.

“Eldest Young Lady, the Master has spoken sensibly. You should return to the Xuanling Sect first. After Yifan recovers from his injuries, I will also ask him to return to the Leiting Sect.” The Great Elder sighed softly and helplessly.

Since matters had reached this stage, they had no choice but to accept their fate.

“…” Was it so hard for her to finish a sentence?

Ye Qingtang could not help but feel a little frustrated. She was about to blurt out the outcome to Ye Ling and the others when someone suddenly kicked open the front door of the Ye House.

A few Ye Family guards nervously ran in, their faces pale, and said, “Master, Elders, something terrible has happened. The Master of the Duan Family is at the door!”

“What!” Ye Ling and the others were all stunned.

“The Duan Family is truly impatient. They’ve come knocking without delay.” The Second Elder laughed coldly.

“I would like to see what other tricks the Duan Family has up its sleeve!” The Great Elder’s expression was somber. Dan Yifan’s injuries had filled him with hatred for the Duan Family.

With that, the Great Elder led the way by standing up and walking towards the front yard.

Ye Ling and the others followed.

Ye Qingtang, who had been continually interrupted, could only speechlessly watch the departing figures of the crowd.

Was it so difficult to let her finish her sentence!!

The commotion in the front yard had alarmed many members of the Ye Family. The younger members who had just gone to rest now hurried back.

The Master of the Duan Family, Duan Yangjing, was standing somberly in the front yard on Ye Family territory. Behind him stood various elders from the Duan Family, Duan Tianrao, and Duan Tianrui.

“Ye Ling, come out!” Duan Yangjing stepped forward and roared fiercely.

When Ye Ling and the others reached the front yard and saw Duan Yangjing and the others who had come with ill intention, their expressions grew grave.

“Duan Yangjing, don’t go too far. You are now in Ye Family territory. You people from the Duan Family better behave yourselves!” Ye Ling coldly berated them.

“Behave? You Ye Family people dare to talk to me of behaving! If you don’t give us a good explanation today, I might even lead men and exterminate the Ye Family!” Duan Yangjing glared ferociously at Ye Ling. His eyes were so bloodshot they almost seemed to be dripping blood.

When Ye Ling and the others saw Duan Yangjing’s murderous expression, they maintained their dignity but could not help but grumble inwardly.

What was the matter with this Duan Yangjing?

Why did he bring so many people to come knocking?

Even if the Duan Family won this match, they should not behave like that.
