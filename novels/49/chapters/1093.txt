Chapter 1094 Reincarnation of the Spiritual Abode (2)

Ye Qingtang was unsure whether this baby girl and baby boy were You Yun and Demon Lord Luo Xue. It was just that these two babies looked too similar to both of them.

Logically speaking, You Yun had died too long ago, and although her heart was stored, it should not be able to allow her to be reborn as a human…

However, You Yun’s Spiritual Abode was already different from that from ordinary people, and it was unknown if there were any unexpected occurrences.

No one could be sure of what was happening exactly.

Even Ye Qingtang could not be certain of the reason behind this abnormal situation before their eyes.

Just as Ye Qingtang was observing the two babies, the Falling Sky Valley masses seem to also be looking at the two babies carefully.

After seeing the face of that baby boy, one of the dejected Peak Masters suddenly broke out into a smile as though he found a straw to clutch at. He wiped his tears away and pointed at the baby boy.

“Look! This little boy looks so similar to old Valley Master! He must be the reincarnation of the old Valley Master. There’s no wrong in this… Quickly look…”

“That’s right! That must be the case!” Another Falling Sky Valley Peak Master immediately suppressed his agony and nodded repeatedly. “I’ve already heard enough to understand just now. Our Falling Sky Valley’s old Valley Master is Divine King Luo Xue from ten thousand years ago. For someone who is known as half a God, it is nothing for him to be reincarnated after death!”

Demon Lord Luo Xue built Falling Sky Valley all by himself and was kind and magnanimous to everyone in Falling Sky Valley.

Regardless of the internal strife within Falling Sky Valley, the old Valley Master was always the icon of respect for every Peak Master.

As the Peak Masters stepped forward successively and looked at the baby boy, anticipatory comments could be heard.

It was as though they had already firmly believed that the baby boy was none other than Demon Lord Luo Xue, who died a while ago.

At this instant, the birth of the two babies in Falling Sky Valley swept the despair away

No matter the Peak Masters or disciples, everyone’s attention was attracted by the babies, which hung on the enormous tree, and they seemed to be influenced by the pure, genuine smiles of the babies.

“What should we do… The two kids can’t possibly be hung on the tree…”

Perfected Xuanchen frowned slightly, and he instinctively looked at Ye Qingtang.

After going through this saga, the entire Falling Sky Valley had viewed the Yang Lord Ye Qingtang as the backbone of Falling Sky Valley, and everyone instinctively sought for her opinion.

Nonetheless, Ye Qingtang had never encountered such a situation before and could not make the most accurate judgment in a short time.

“We’ll wait and see,” After a long while, Ye Qingtang said cautiously. “Since they are born on this tree and are so young right now, we cannot be sure if they will be injured if they are forcefully detached from this tree.”

Although Ye Qingtang was unaware of this enigma, she somehow felt that the two babies should be absorbing the nutrients of the giant

Perhaps because they felt that the baby boy was the reincarnation of Demon Lord Luo Xue, the Falling Sky Valley masses looked slightly more relieved.

Only Ye Qingtang was still frowning deeply and showed no signs of relaxation.

Just as everyone heaved a sigh of relief…

A wild gust of wind kicked up out of a sudden!

The endless wild wind seemed to want to tear everything in the world into pieces, and a piercing sound rang in the surroundings.

At the same time, a pair of blood-colored eyes seemed to replace the moon as it looked down at Falling Sky Valley.

A boundless and enormous force enshrouded everything that existed.
