Chapter 974 Do You Really Want Me To Compete? (1)

“The peak of the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level One?” Duan Tianyun stood unharmed on the dais and looked disdainfully at Dan Yifan. His lips curled in a contemptuous smile.

“Is that all?” Duan Tianyun smirked.

There was an uproar below the dais.

No one would have imagined that Dan Yifan, who had seemed to be so powerful just now, would be injured by Duan Tianyun in just one move.

The youths from the Ye Family had been filled with confidence. But now, when they saw blood seeping from the corners of Dan Yifan’s mouth, their expectant expressions seemed to freeze.

How could this be… Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Dan Yifan stood up clumsily. It was as if his entire body had been soaked in icy water that was so cold it chilled his bones. Every inch of his skin was permeated with a piercing chill.

“You are merely at the peak of the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level One. How dare you be so presumptuous towards our Duan Family? You are such a fool.” Duan Tianyun looked at Dan Yifan coldly. The aura that surrounded him seemed to be poised to swallow the whole world.

“You have reached… Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level One…” Dan Yifan looked at Duan Tianyun, who was standing before him. The aura surrounding Duan Tianyun was completely different from that of Duan Luoning. At that moment, it was evident that his power was far superior to his.

“That’s right.” Duan Tianyun laughed softly and raised his chin proudly.

Dan Yifan turned pale.

He was only in his teens, and among his age group, he was considered to be a rare genius. Otherwise, he could not possibly have broken through to the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level One at his age.

However…

However, no matter how powerful the peak of the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level One was, it could not compare to the Second Heaven.

He would never have imagined that the Duan Family had Duan Tianyun, who was at the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level One!

One must know that in the entire Ye Family, only his Grandfather and Third Elder had reached this stage.

But Duan Tianyun was so young!

“Dan Yifan is it? You seemed really confident just now. Why are you so forlorn now?” Duan Tianyun laughed softly and looked at Dan Yifan disdainfully.

Dan Yifan’s expression was truly ugly.

The crowd below the dais was still in an uproar.

Although they had heard that Duan Tianyun had broken through to the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level One, no one had actually seen him display his prowess, and they thought that the Duan Family had spread the rumors to confuse others.

Yet, who would have thought…

it was actually true.

At that moment, everyone looked at Dan Yifan with a rather pitying expression.

No matter how extraordinarily gifted Dan Yifan was, he was no match for Duan Tianyun.

“Have you brats from the Ye Family clearly seen the gap between you and our Duan Family?” When Duan Tianrui saw that his oldest brother had beaten the Ye Family’s representative, he mocked them smugly.

The youths from the Ye Family clenched their fists tightly. They fervently wished they could tear Duan Tianrui’s mouth into pieces.

“Since your skills are inferior, you better obediently crawl away. Everything will be fine as long as you obey the rules and pay your tribute. Why humiliate yourself before everyone from Lin Town like you did today?” Duan Tianrui mocked them boldly.

These grating words were like knives that carved every word onto the hearts of Ye Family’s youths.

Dan Yifan took a deep breath and diligently tried to push his inner qi around his body.

“I haven’t lost yet,” he said coldly as he looked at Duan Tianyun.

“Oh? You won’t give up? Do you really have a death wish? In that case, I’ll fulfill your wish.” Duan Tianyun’s face was a mask of cruelty.

Below the dais, Ye Qingtang calmly shook her head as she watched the floundering Dan Yifan.
