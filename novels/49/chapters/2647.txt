In this world, the weak would remain prey to the strong and had to fight for opportunities. Even if the weak were lucky enough to encounter a fortuitous opportunity, they would still be hunted down by the strong.

Just like in Ye Qingtang’s previous life, she had the so-called Heart of the Demon God in her body but was hunted for her entire life. It was extremely vexing. After entering the depths, Ye Qingtang started being very cautious. There were many powerful demonic creatures here. However, along the way, Ye Qingtang did not even see anything at all.

It was likely that those powerful demonic beings had already been wiped out by those powerful factions. Otherwise, the demonic beings were already in hiding.

Currently, the most powerful experts in the world had already gathered in this region. No matter how powerful the demonic creatures were, they would not choose to clash head-on with those beings. It was more likely that they would go into hiding.

After Ye Qingtang entered the depths, she kept looking for the main camp of the Great Immortal Temple. However, there were no traces of them at the moment. In fact, it was completely deserted all around her.

Ye Qingtang guessed that the Fourth Domain legacy had not been activated yet. The factions should be waiting near the legacy. However, Ye Qingtang did not know where the legacy was. Actually, Ye Qingtang did not intend to fight for the Fourth Domain legacy. She just wanted to use this opportunity to see if she could find a way to leave this era, or absorb the power of the Heart of the Heavenly Dao. All the elite cultivators would definitely be coveting the core legacy. With Ye Qingtang’s skills, fighting for the core legacy would be the equivalent of suicide.

After searching for about two days in the depths, Ye Qingtang finally passed through the deep forest and arrived at the canyon on the third morning.

It was an endless canyon filled with green mountains and rivers as if it was a paradise on earth.

In the middle of the valley was a pitch-black tower that reached the clouds. It looked very dilapidated.

When she neared that tower, a strange expression surfaced in Ye Qingtang’s eyes. Her body trembled uncontrollably, rejecting that tower… “What’s going on…” Ye Qingtang’s expression grew increasingly strange. She was also very curious about this pitch-black tower. As if drawn by some force, she instinctively walked towards the tower.

However, when Ye Qingtang approached the pitch-black tower, she felt dizzy and nauseous.

There seemed to be countless treasures hidden in the pitch-black tower. Ye Qingtang yearned for them as if she was possessed.

However, before Ye Qingtang could enter the tower, someone gave her left shoulder a heavy pat.

Ye Qingtang returned to her senses.

Looking at the tower again, it was no longer the same as before. It was engulfed in a terrifying demonic aura. If she had really entered the tower, the consequences would be unimaginable.

“Stop moving forward. You’ll die.”

A gentle voice entered Ye Qingtang’s ears. Ye Qingtang was stunned and turned around instinctively.

It was the woman dressed in white. She was gazing meaningfully at the pitch-black tower in front of her.
