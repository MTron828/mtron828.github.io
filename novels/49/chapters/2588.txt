Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

Not only did the Heart of Heavenly Dao not bring Ye Qingtang any benefits, but it also kept absorbing her cultivation level and snatching her good fortune from her. It seemed to be the case that the Heart of the Heavenly Dao brought her indescribable bad luck.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang’s eyes flickered. Some thoughts formed in her mind.

Ye Qingtang now knew that the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline in her body was very powerful and domineering. In that case, could the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline absorb all the power from her Heart of the Heavenly Dao?

At the thought of this, Ye Qingtang’s expression changed slightly, and an indescribable glint surfaced in her eyes. If the mutant Heavenly Demon Bloodline in her body could really absorb the power of the Heart of the Heavenly Dao in her, it would be a huge blessing for her.

However, Ye Qingtang was in a dilemma. Although her idea was not bad, how could she let her Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline know the existence of the Heart of the Heavenly Dao and discover its power. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Even though the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline had an extremely domineering devouring ability, it was useless if it could not discover the dao energy of the Heart of the Heavenly Dao.

The situation was different from before. The Divine Phoenix Bloodline did not have a shell wrapped around it, nor did it conceal the aura of its own bloodline. Therefore, the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline had long coveted the Divine Phoenix Bloodline, while the Heart of Heavenly Dao was a little

special. Firstly, the heart was a shell, and the dao power was hidden deep inside. There was no reason for the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline to pay special attention to its owner’s heart.

If she wanted the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline to meet the Heart of the Heavenly Dao, the bloodline would need some guidance.

“The Heart of the Heavenly Dao cannot be controlled…” Ye Qingtang was deep in thought.

So it was now down to whether she could control the power of the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline. If she could not direct the power of the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline, then she would have to give up this idea. It would be useless.

Ye Qingtang tried to communicate with the power of the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline.

Initially, the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline seemed to be rather unwilling to follow Ye Qingtang’s instructions. However, in the end, the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline compromised and was guided by Ye Qingtang to slowly search for the heart.

After about an hour, Ye Qingtang was already sweating profusely. Under Ye Qingtang’s guidance, the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline finally met the Heart of the Heavenly Dao.

It had to be said that even though Ye Qingtang was close to the sub-Emperor stage, it was still very difficult for her to control the power of the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline. Fortunately, the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline was relatively cooperative. If it refused to cooperate with her, Ye

Qingtang would be helpless.

The Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline had just swallowed her Divine Emperor Bloodline. Ye Qingtang had no choice but to humble herself to it.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang continued to carefully guide the power of the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline. If she was careless and the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline swallowed her entire heart, she would end up dying for nothing.

Under Ye Qingtang’s careful guidance, the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline gently surrounded the Heart of Heavenly Dao in Ye Qingtang’s body.

After waiting quietly for a long time, Ye Qingtang realized that her Heart of the Heavenly Dao did not have any reaction at all. It seemed to remain in a deep sleep.
