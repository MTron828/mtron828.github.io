Chapter 1031 So What If It’s Yunxiao Sect (3)

Who exactly gave them this courage?!

What laughing stock!

At this instant, the Yin Yang Perfected Lord Branch Masters of the other three branches rushed over to the headquarters along with their respective senior members and talented disciples. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

In no time, the Ye Family field was filled with people, and all of them were powerful figures.

“Haha, YunXiao Sect is truly a good example for the super sects. If the Nine Nights Dynasty and Formidable Heavens Dynasty were as bold as the Yunxiao Sect, it would really be worthwhile.” A Branch Master scorned as he stared at Elder Yin and Elder Gu.

The two Yunxiao Sect elders had the skills of a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord and came to the current Ye Residence just by themselves, wanting to catch the Ye Family’s Eldest Young Lady who was a Yang Lord…

Was the entire YunXiao Sect a group of idiots?!

“This…”

At this moment, Elder Yin and Elder Gu were struck with astonishment. Regardless of the Ye Family or Si Family, numerous Yin Yang Perfected Lords actually appeared in both families!

The two Yunxiao Sect elders even knew the names of some of the Yin Yang Perfected Lords!

These people were not even supposed to appear in Lin Town, yet for some reason, they were all gathered in this remote town.

“How can this be… Yin Yang Perfected Lord… You all… This…” Feeling the powerful skills of several Yin Yang Perfected Lords, Elder Gu trembled slightly. Their Yunxiao Sect merely had two Yin Yang Perfected Lords: one of them was the Grand Elder, who did not participate in the affairs of the external world, while the other was the Sect Master…

Yet right before their eyes…

There were actually numerous Yin Yang Perfected Lords in the Ye Family!!

In terms of the number of Yin Yang Perfected Lords, the Ye Family actually had much more than YunXiao Sect!!

“Do Yunxiao Sect and Eldest Young Lady have enmity?”

Suddenly, Elder Bai Kui and Elder Zijin walked over slowly with ten youths behind them.

Elder Bai Kui and Elder Zijin were administering an assessment for the new young talents previously. About two hundred people participated, but only these ten people truly passed the assessment. Moreover, Elder Bai Kui realized that the Massacre Bloodline energy was activated in the body of one of the youths, and it was extremely impressive.

Once the assessment ended, Elder Bai Kui and Elder Zijin wanted to bring these newly-recruited disciples to Ye Qingtang and introduce that youth with the Massacre Bloodline to Ye Qingtang. Yet, they just returned to the Ye Residence and was faced with this situation.

“YunXiao Sect…?”

The ten youths behind Elder Bai Kui and Elder Zijin had strange expressions. That YunXiao Sect actually came to cause trouble to the Ye Family… Were they tired of living?

Half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lords came to the Ye Family to stir trouble and wanted to capture a Yang Lord; they were truly exposing themselves to ridicule when such a matter was made known to others.

“Bai… Bai Kui… Formidable Heavens Dynasty… Grand Imperial Sire!”

Elder Gu was extremely startled after seeing Bai Kui.

“Daoist Zijin…”

Elder Yin’s expression changed greatly when his eyes landed on Daoist Zijin.

Regardless of Bai Kui or Daoist Zijin, both were renowned powerful figures of this mainland. Especially Bai Kui, not only was he the Grand Imperial Sire of Formidable Heavens Dynasty, his martial skills were almost the best, for he possessed a cultivation base of Yin Yang Perfected Lord Third Heaven!
