Chapter 2659 I’m Here To Kill You (4)

Ye Qingtang was no stranger to the skills of Demon God Han Cangming. She had personally experienced how terrifying he was. However, she had no idea how powerful the Paragon was compared to the Demon God Han Cangming.

Suddenly, there was a clear clanging sound.

In the next second, violent winds blew in all directions, and the faint sound of thunder rang out in the sky.

Ye Qingtang saw the Paragon unsheathe her sharp sword, which emitted a cold light.

Heaven-level divine weapon… Just unsheathing it was enough to stir the power of nature.

Ye Qingtang knew how terrifying a Heaven-grade divine weapon was.

“Han Cangming, where is my friend?!”

Ye Qingtang suddenly took a few steps forward and shouted at the man in the air.

“Your friend?” Han Cangming looked at Ye Qingtang. “How would I know?”

“Han Cangming, don’t pretend to be ignorant… he is the person with the Karma Bloodline.” Ye Qingtang frowned. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

For the past two years, Ye Qingtang had been worried about Ling Yan’s safety.

With Ling Yan’s almost useless martial skills, it was impossible for him to possess Han Cangming. Whether Ling Yan was dead or alive, Ye Qingtang had to know.

“Oh… I remember now…” Han Cangming’s lips curled up as he stared at Ye Qingtang.” Why? You seem to care about him a lot. Can I ask what’s your relationship with him?”

“What has my relationship with him got to do with you?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“In that case, I can only say that he’s already dead,” Han Cangming said with a smile.

Ye Qingtang’s pupils constricted and her body trembled slightly. Endless anger surged from her eyes and she instinctively wanted to continue moving forward.

However, before Ye Qingtang could do anything, she was stopped by the Paragon.

“Sister Ah Yao…” Ye Qingtang looked at the Paragon.

“Sister Ye Yue, don’t be rash.” The Paragon shook her head.

In the Paragon’s opinion, with Ye Qingtang’s skills, she would just be courting death if she went head-on with Han Cangming.

The Paragon looked at Han Cangming. “Looks like there’s no room for discussion regarding this matter.”

“Heh, Immortal Emperor, you must have misunderstood something. “Han Cangming smiled when he saw the Paragon take out her Heaven-level divine weapon.

The Paragon said expressionlessly, “Oh, why do you say that? If there’s any misunderstanding, you can clarify it.”

“I didn’t appear today to target your so-called sister. I didn’t say that I came here to kill her,” Han Cangming said.

“If so, then there’s no animosity between us,” said the Paragon.

Han Cangming shook his head. “That’s not entirely true. Although I’m not here to kill her, I am here… to kill you.”

Both the Paragon and Ye Qingtang were stunned.

Han Cangming was not here to snatch her Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline, but to kill the Paragon? Why? “You are here to kill me?” The Paragon quickly regained her composure.

“Yes.” Han Cangming nodded.

The Paragon smiled. “There’s no grudge between us. Today is the first time we’ve met, yet you want to kill me. I must admit I am very curious as to why.”
