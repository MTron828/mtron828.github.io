Just when the Giant Lizard’s attention was attracted away, Gu Yanqiu exchanged a look with Meng Sheng and immediately jumped onto the Giant Lizard’s back, piercing the sword in his hands directly into its neck!

But just as Gu Yanqiu’s sword landed, a cold light suddenly passed by his shoulder!

Gu Yanqiu avoided it instinctively, and that cold light punctured right at the wound on the Giant Lizard’s neck!

Once the cold light sunk in, Gu Yanqiu then realized that it was an arrow.

The wound was on the Giant Lizard’s neck, the most fragile position. Since it was protected by a thick armor, Gu Yanqiu and the rest finally found an opportunity with much difficulty to rip this wound open and were just waiting for this final fatal blow.

However…

That arrow was a step faster than Gu Yanqiu, and it sunk into the Giant Lizard’s flesh.

With a sudden grunt from the Giant Lizard, large amounts of blood seeped out from the corner of its mouth. Qin Huan, who was diverting the Giant Lizard’s attention, was distracted by that cold light as well, and his footsteps slowed down a little.

But just before the Giant Lizard fell down, it spat out a mouthful of poison violently which coincidentally splattered on the distracted Qin Huan!

The Giant Lizard fell on the ground with a loud howl, but what followed was Qin Huan’s painful cry.

The Giant Lizard’s poison was extremely corrosive, and that last mouthful of poison happened to be spat on Qin Huan’s chest. In just a moment, the clothes before Qin Huan’s chest were completely corroded away.

Everyone was taken aback for a moment, and Gu Yanqiu returned to his senses immediately, dashing to Qin Huan’s side.

Meng Sheng was stunned as he looked at the breathless Giant Lizard on the ground.

“A level 6 Giant Lizard is just like that only.” A rather sarcastic laugh sounded.

The moment that voice sounded, Meng Sheng and other Xuanling Sect disciples looked towards the voice at once.

What appeared before them were ten young men in green who were walking towards them haughtily.

And in the leader’s hands was an exquisite, silver bow. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The arrow which killed the level 6 Giant Lizard was shot from the silver bow in that man’s hands.

Meng Sheng’s face darkened instantly.

All of them recognized these people’s uniforms. It was Qinglin Sect’s uniform. Qinglin Sect and Xuanling Sect were both sects and specialized in swordplay. Despite years of competition, they still could not conclude a winner, and it could be said that they had been on bad terms for a long time.

If the disciples from these two sects met outside on usual days, they would most likely end up in a fight.

Meng Sheng and the rest did not expect that they would encounter people from Qinglin Sect here, and what was worse was the fact that the current situation was very unfavorable to them.

They had already depleted all their energy from the struggle with the level 6 Giant Lizard just now, and it would be dangerous if they were to fight with Qinglin Sect’s people now.

“Sixth Junior Brother, remove the Giant Lizard’s poison gall,” said the leader, Du Qiang, with a smile as the swept a belittling glance across the Xuanling Sect disciples.

The moment Du Qiang’s words were said, Xuanling Sect’s disciples darkened their faces immediately.

The purpose of hunting the Giant Lizard was to obtain the poison gall in its body. If the poisonous gallbladder was snatched away by the Qinglin Sect people, their mission this time would really be wasted.

“This Giant Lizard is our prey, who gave you the permission to touch it!” Meng Sheng reproached coldly with a long face.

Du Qiang raised his brows and looked at the tired expressions of the Xuanling Sect disciples disdainfully.

“Your prey? This Giant Lizard was clearly killed with my one arrow just now. How did it become your prey?
