Chapter 1904: The Holy Lord’s Dharma Artifact (1)

“Got it.” Ming Wang accepted the command and was prepared to leave when he suddenly halted and glanced at the slumbering Jiang Shaobai. But in the end, he left without saying another word.

Ye Qingtang heaved a sigh of relief as Ming Wang left. It looked like Ming Wang did not suspect anything yet.

Upon returning to the Temple of Shadows, Ye Qingtang felt a sense of familiar comfort. Ye Qingtang had been in a tense state of mind since entering the mystic realm. She had not had a chance to relax at all.

After a quick wash up and change of clothes, she gazed at the sleeping Jiang Shaobai, her heart heavy with emotion.

“I think that you should keep a close eye on Jiang Shaobai from now on,” Little White Tiger piped up.

Ye Qingtang, “...”

“That Ming Gu is already targeting Jiang Shaobai. Even with Ming Wang around, who knows what Ming Gu will do with that crazy jealousy of his. He might secretly kill off Jiang Shaobai one of these days.” Little White Tiger couldn’t help shuddering when it recalled the malevolent way Ming Gu had been glowering at Jiang Shaobai.

Ming Gu was already gritting his teeth in anger when he first saw Ye Qingtang carrying Little White Tiger. Now that Ye Qingtang had returned with this Jiang Shaobai, Ming Gu must be bursting with rage.

“I know.” Ye Qingtang sighed. Ming Gu’s possessiveness of the Holy Lord of Shadows was incomparable to any other. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Just as Ye Qingtang was speaking with Little White Tiger, there was a sudden knock on the door.

Opening the door, a woeful Ming Gu was standing outside. Hands crossed behind his back, he gazed uneasily at Ye Qingtang.

“Ah Yao, don’t be angry... I...I just missed you too much. That’s why I behaved in that manner earlier. I... I won’t do anything to that dirty rascal. Don’t be angry at me.” Ming Gu gazed pathetically at Ye Qingtang. Although he didn’t like anyone else occupying Ah Yao’s attention, he was even more afraid of Ah Yao hating him.

As Ye Qingtang looked at Ming Gu’s pitiful little face, any anger she might have felt would have already dissipated. But anyway, she hadn’t been angry in the first place.

“Ah Yao, I was the one who cleaned your room when you were not around. I didn’t let anyone in. I have also been keeping this item on your behalf.” Ming Gu took out a gold-gilded black box.

That gold-gilded black box looked very familiar. It was given to her when she first entered the Temple of Shadows. They said it belonged to the Holy Lord of Shadows.

But Ye Qingtang had been unable to open it no matter how hard she tried. As a result, she gradually forgot about it.

Ye Qingtang accepted the gold-gilded black box and stroked Ming Gu’s little head.

Almost glowing from her actions, Ming Gu looked very bashful and proud, as if he had just been praised.

“Ah Yao, you should rest early. I will have the servants bring some flowers to your room tomorrow. Also... you came back so suddenly so I didn’t have time to prepare anything at all. I will prepare some Black Flame Worms for you tomorrow.”

The image of those nightmarish Black Flame Worms and those blood-drenched flowers came up in her mind. For a moment, she suddenly couldn’t summon up even the slightest hint of a smile.

“There’s no rush.” Ye Qingtang maintained a calm facade.

After giving her a bashful grin, Ming Gu grunted and ran off.

Ye Qingtang closed the door and thought of how this room would be filled with those blood-drenched flowers tomorrow... she suddenly found it difficult to breathe.

My goodness!

Ye Qingtang sighed and sat down on a chair. She mulled over the Jiang family massacre but didn’t manage to glean any new insights.

Suddenly... A clear, cracking sound seemed to resound across the room.

Little White Tiger widened its eyes.

“What did you do?”
