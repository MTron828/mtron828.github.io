Chapter 1879: Ten Thousand Poison Valley (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Young Miss, the most important thing now is that the people of the Ten Thousand Poison Valley are after us. I heard that they even sent Liu Rusu and Liu Jiangran this time. I’m afraid they’re not giving up.” Long Yi’s expression was dark.

Not many people knew about their secret plans this time, and they had only brought along a few people for fear that their plans would be leaked. Even though they had brought only their elite guards, it was obvious that the Ten Thousand Poison Valley had already known about their plans from a long time ago and wanted to launch a surprise attack upon their arrival.

“Who was the one who leaked the information? I’m going to skin them alive when I find out,” Long Yao said through gritted teeth.

“Who exactly leaked the information? We won’t be able to find out here, so we can only investigate thoroughly when we’re back.” Long Yi’s expression was dark. Now that the Ten Thousand Poison Valley knew about their plans, getting out of this place safely would become even harder.

Long Yao knew this as well. Panic filled her heart as she thought of her brother’s critical injuries and she went with Long Yi to investigate.

Ye Qingtang’s expression was complicated as they left.

Fu Qiu noticed it and threw her a silent look.

On the pretext that they had something to ask, Ye Qingtang and Jiang Shaobai secretly went to find Fu Qiu.

“Do you recognize those people?” Fu Qiu suddenly asked them.

Ye Qingtang shook her head.

Fu Qiu said, “When they first arrived, they showed a photo of Jiu’er to me. They seem to be looking for her as well.”

Ye Qingtang nodded. She was there when Long Yao had taken the photo out.

“That young girl told me that Jiu’er is her aunt, who vanished after entering this mystic realm.” Fu Qiu hadn’t told Long Yao everything that it knew about Jiu’er.

Jiu’er was extremely important to Fu Qiu. As it knew she was hiding from someone, it would not disclose information about her before confirming the person’s identity.

Fu Qiu trusted only Ye Qingtang, who was Jiu’er’s daughter.

“I don’t know what your mother was running from, but I know that I would still be as ignorant as the others from my clan if not for her. I want to find her as well...” Fu Qiu sighed. Jiu’er’s sudden disappearance meant that he had not had the time to even thank her properly.

“Do you have any clues about my mother with you?” Ye Qingtang asked. It seemed like there were two clues regarding her mother’s last sighting.

The first was the powerful man who had appeared that year, and the second was the reason her mother had to hide.

It was already impossible to find the man, but if Long Yao and the rest were from the same clan, they would probably know something.

“I know what you’re thinking about. I’ll help you talk to them later,” Fu Qiu said.

“Thank you.” Ye Qingtang gave it a salute.

Fu Qiu waved her hand away and said, “There’s no need for thanks. I owe your mother too much and it’s something that I should be doing. If you manage to find her one day, please help me thank her...

Deep down, Fu Qiu had a feeling that it would not be able to leave this place. Every time it was suggested, the idea would be shot down.

Ye Qingtang nodded her head in agreement

Fu Qiu didn’t say much else and just told Ye Qingtang to go back. It told her that their stay would be free from now on, so they didn’t need to give it any more spirit stones.
