Chapter 1753: Camouflage (3)

Ye Qingtang was startled by the sight of that fiendish demon.

Had she been discovered?

When she saw the crazed eyes upon her, Ye Qingtang’s heart had leaped to the back of her throat. These fiendish demons were mostly Emperor level while she was only a Fourth Heaven level. She was no match for them at all...

At this point, the fiendish demon’s eyes swivelled as its saliva dripped down from its tongue, emitting wafts of an evil stench. It suddenly jumped down from the wall and stood before Ye Qingtang, stretching and contorting its hunched back and long limbs. A mighty aura radiated from its body.

It adopted the pose of a predator eyeing its prey.

A drop of cold sweat sprouted on Ye Qingtang’s temple. She had successfully camouflaged herself against all the other fiendish demons she encountered along the way. How did this particular demon manage to discover her?

Ye Qingtang immediately leaped into action. She did not dare to hesitate at all. Carrying Little White Tiger and Little Heavenly Demon, she fled.

She was no match for a fiendish demon. If she was caught, she would be doomed.

That fiendish demon was momentarily startled by Ye Qingtang’s sudden movement. But it quickly recovered itself and emitted a rageful howl.

It was an earth-shattering howl and following that, a powerful energy was launched straight at Ye Qingtang.

It all happened in less than a second.

Ye Qingtang felt like she had been struck by an entire mountain the moment that energy hit her. Before she had time to react, she was flying through the air from the force.

She could feel a gush of blood surging up her throat as she landed. Gritting her teeth, she swallowed hard to hold back the blood.

That fiendish demon was stunned when it saw Ye Qingtang collapsing just from its howl. It then gave a mocking smile as it slowly stepped toward her. Its grotesque face was full of malevolence.

“Eastern... trash... how dare you... come here...” The fiendish demon’s voice sounded very weird and creepy. It squatted down and gazed at Ye Qingtang. The demon’s saliva dripped down onto her face.

The demon was momentarily taken aback.

“Human... you actually have the smell of a human on you... ha... you probably sliced off this human skin not long ago...”

The hairs at the back of Ye Qingtang’s neck stood on end. Her body had gone frozen stiff, she was unable to move an inch.

The fiendish demon’s words were a shock to her.

What did it mean?

Hadn’t this demon recognized her identity as a human? DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“What a beautiful piece of skin. I will eat you... and then keep this skin for myself...” The fiendish demon licked its lips as a greedy glint flashed across its eyes. It reached out long claws toward Ye Qingtang’s head, all ready to peel her skin off.

An overwhelming sense of despondency fell over Ye Qingtang. She was finally meeting her death here. Before the strength of this fiendish demon, she was too weak.

But just as Ye Qingtang resigned herself to her fate, the fiendish demon’s face stiffened before contorting into a livid expression. It turned and howled.

Before Ye Qingtang could understand what was happening, she saw the fiendish demon give a sudden tremble before standing immobile on the spot.

In the next second, a pair of sharp claws pierced through that demon and tore it in half!
