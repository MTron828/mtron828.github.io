Chapter 1830: Cemetery of the True Gods (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Tons of skeletons stacked above each other. They looked to be the scattered remains from different beings and were decomposed into a graveyard of muted ash gray. The wind blew through the gaps of those remains.

Before Ye Qingtang even got closer, she could sense an intense aura of death coming from the insides of the skeleton wall.

She couldn’t exactly explain it. The wind wasn’t piercingly cold, it felt just right to permeate through her clothes and skin, spreading all over her body.

“Is this... the Cemetery of the True Gods?” Ye Qingtang lifted her head to look at the almost 20-meter-tall wall of skeletons. It was spectacular, blocking the path in front of her.

“Did you see it in your illusion too?” Little White Tiger looked at the wall of skeletons in front and noticed that the dark aura was completely different from the aura exuded by the Undead Clan.

Though it was deadly silent, they could somehow hear countless dead souls wailing.

It was more than just sounds they could hear with their ears, the sounds could somehow permeate through to their soul.

Ye Qingtang shook her head.

She only saw the Cemetery of the True Gods descending here in the illusion. Right after that, the Cursed True God left this place and she had no idea about how the Cemetery of the True Gods had turned out after that.

“Is the Cursed True God’s remains... behind this wall of skeletons?” Little White Tiger ventured.

Ye Qingtang wasn’t certain either and walked over to the wall of skeletons. Suddenly, a gust of wind permeated through the wall and blew her hair around. It hit her on the cheeks just like hailstones.

It felt somewhat creepy.

But she wouldn’t step back even if she could sense the deadly aura.

According to her memories in the illusion, the Cursed True God had descended somewhere close to this wall of skeletons. The only way to leave this place would be to destroy the bones of the Cursed True God.

At that exact moment, Ye Qingtang leaped and flew behind the wall of skeletons. Little White Tiger also followed her. The moment Ye Qingtang looked down to see what was behind the wall, her eyes widened in shock.

All she could see were endless dead bodies all scattered across the ground. Their faces were an ash gray, these humans seemed to be consumed by the ground. Their bodies were buried in the ground from the neck down, and only their heads were exposed. Their necks seemed to have been broken.

Behind the wall of skeletons was countless humans buried under the ground...

“This is like purgatory...” Even Little White Tiger couldn’t help but shiver when it saw the entire ground buried with humans.

Ye Qingtang secretly took a deep breath to steady her pounding heart before she slowly lifted her eyes.

Standing right in the center was a 100-meter-tall feminine figure.

“The Cursed True God!” The moment Ye Qingtang saw the figure, it overlapped with the Cursed True God she saw in the illusion.

In the illusion, the Cursed True God had been a more normal height. But this Cursed True God in front of her seemed to be an expanded version. She stood tall and upright above the remains of the humans.

With closed eyes and crossed arms, her skin wasn’t of any discernible color at all. Her body was also ash gray, just like a stone figure.

In the illusion, Ye Qingtang saw with her own eyes that the Cursed True God had collapsed in a puddle of blood. That scene was completely different from this scene in front of her eyes now.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates
