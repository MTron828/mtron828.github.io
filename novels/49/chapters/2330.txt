Chapter 2331: Trust (3)

“I teach him about elixir refinement, of course.” Ye Qingtang stated in a mild tone.

Zhu Ning gave a cold laugh. He felt that Ye Qing was just a fool spouting nonsense.

“Someone like you teaching elixir refinement? Perhaps if there was no other teacher left in the faculty. The medicine faculty is not somewhere you can come and go as you please. Leave here immediately.”

Song Yanhan felt very smug as he watched Zhu Ning admonish Ye Qing.

“Yun Chen is a student from the medicine faculty and today is the faculty selection trials. Why can’t he be here?” Ye Qingtang questioned Zhu Ning with a steady stare.

Zhu Ning looked like he had just heard a great joke.

“Him? He wants to participate in the selection trials?”

“Why? What’s wrong with that?” Ye Qingtang asked.

Zhu Ning suddenly laughed. “Good. I want to see what kind of alchemist a teacher from another faculty can produce. I will state this now. Yun Chen will never be able to qualify for the Inter-Academy Competition.”

“What if he does?” Ye Qingtang insisted.

Zhu Ning replied in a cold voice, “If someone like him can qualify, I will seal off my tripod forever and never refine elixirs ever again! But if he fails to qualify, neither of you are allowed to ever step foot inside the medicine faculty! In addition, you must kneel and apologize to the entire medicine faculty for your arrogance and ignorance!”

“Deal!” Ye Qingtang agreed without any hesitation.

“Boss!” Yun Chen was shocked.

In return, Ye Qing only shot him a “keep quiet and stay calm” look.

Zhu Ning snorted.

“I look forward to it then.” With that, Zhu Ning turned to leave. Song Yanhan followed him. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

All the medicine faculty students stared at Ye Qing as if he was insane. Had yesterday’s success gone to Teacher Ye’s head?

Did he really think that just because he produced a few Divine Lord-level students, he was now invincible?

This was the medicine faculty. Even if you were an Emperor level practitioner, it was an entirely different matter to stand in front of a tripod.

Teacher Ye was just asking for it.

Watching Zhu Ning and the others depart, Yun Chen turned toward Ye Qing. “Boss, you didn’t have to do that, I…”

Ye Qing interrupted, “It’s not an issue, I already made that bet with Di Nuo. It’s just another bet. No harm going all in now. Anyway…”

With that, Ye Qingtang patted Yun Chen on the shoulder.

“Yun Chen, you are my student. I believe in you.”

She had taught Lei Yan and the others about martial arts. As for elixir refinement, she had only taught Yun Chen.

In the Evil Soul Forest, Yun Chen would cultivate with Lei Yan and the others during the day. When night fell, he would practice elixir refinement on his own.

And Ye Qingtang had seen it all.

Over the past few months, Yun Chen had worked a hundred times harder than any normal person. In both her previous and current life, she would only have Yun Chen as an alchemy disciple.

With two lives worth of knowledge, she was certain that she would be able to produce an alchemy genius!

Yun Chen was taken aback by Ye Qing’s words. He then lowered his eyes. “Boss, I understand.”

The bet had been made, so there was no going back now. The only thing he could do now was to give his best and protect his teacher’s honor!

“Yun Chen, don’t worry. We are all behind you. The elixirs you produce are so much better than Song Yanhan’s. Don’t worry, just go ahead and do what you do best.” Lei Yan and the others stepped forward and patted Yun Chen on the shoulder, showing their support.

“We don’t need any other alchemist. You are more than enough for us.”

Hang Wenwei and his group never expected things to progress in this way. If it had been them, they would probably not have been able to reject Song Yanhan’s offer.
