“Is this the Ancient God Realm…?”

The little azure dragon followed beside Ling Yan with a slightly surprised expression.

According to the legends, the most mysterious realm was the Ancient God Realm. There were no living creatures in the Ancient God Realm. Only the most ancient consciousnesses existed.

Legend had it that the Ancient God Realm had existed since the world was created, but no one had ever been able to reach it.

And in this world, only Ling Yan could do it.

“Karma bloodline?” The little azure dragon stared at Ling Yan as it fell into deep thought.

The only reason why Ling Yan could come to the Ancient God Realm was because of his karma bloodline. Since ancient times, the karma bloodline was one of a kind, and the Ancient God Realm was only open to those who had it.

“Step back.”

Ling Yan looked at the little azure dragon as he instructed. Although it did not know what Ling Yan wanted to do, the little azure dragon took a few steps back.

“Ancient God, listen to my summon!”

A red light flashed between Ling Yan’s brows.

As Ling Yan uttered those words, an illusory aura slowly approached.

“This is…”

Sensing the illusory aura, the little azure dragon’s body trembled.

The Azure Dragon Clan had a special ability, in that they were immune to auras. Even if they encountered a true immortal, they would not feel suppressed.

Yet this illusory aura was like an insurmountable mountain. It carried an ancient aura, transporting one to an era that was billions of years ago.

A blurry figure appeared in front of them. This figure seemed to have a reach of tens of millions of feet as if it spanned from the beginning of the world to the end of it.

“Holder of the karma bloodline.”

The illusory figure swept across. A thunderous roar resounded in the air.

Ling Yan only said, “I need the Wheel of Destiny.”

“Holder of the karma bloodline, I can try my best to help you but you must pay the price,” the voice returned.

“Agreed.” Ling Yan did not hesitate at all.

“Once the oath is sworn, it cannot be destroyed. Are you willing to pay such a price?” The ancient voice seemed a little surprised.

“Yes.”

“Alright, then it is agreed.”

With that, the figure gradually disappeared. Soon, a Wheel of Destiny appeared somewhere above.

The Wheel of Destiny was not a physical object, but an ethereal aura.

“Ling Yan… are you crazy?” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

After the ancient figure disappeared, the little azure dragon hurriedly ran over and looked at Ling Yan in disbelief.

Did Ling Yan know what he had done? Why was he so crazy?!

“There’s not much time left…” Ling Yan muttered.

“Is it because you blocked the karma for Ye Qingtang… so, you don’t have much time left?” The little azure dragon probed.

“That’s one of the reasons. There’s another reason,” Ling Yan said.

“Another reason?” The little azure dragon was confused.

At that moment, the little azure dragon was a little frustrated. If its ancestors were here, they would definitely understand the meaning behind Ling Yan’s words with their supreme intelligence.

“The Son of Destiny is about to appear…”

At that moment, a karmic natal chart appeared in Ling Yan’s hand. He spoke slowly as he stared at its contents.

“Son of Destiny? What do you mean?” The little azure dragon asked with a frown.

“The so-called Son of Destiny is someone who controls all karmic luck. As long as the Son of Destiny wants to, he can obtain everything he needs. He’s someone chosen by the heavens.” Ling Yan looked at the little azure dragon.

“Ling Yan, are you talking about Ye Qingtang?” The little azure dragon was pondering.

But Ling Yan shook his head. “The Son of Destiny will be our greatest enemy..”
