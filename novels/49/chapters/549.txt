Chapter 550 Blood Moon Holy Lady (2)

‘What token?” Ye Qingtang asked instinctively. ..” Blood Moon Holy Lord stared at her.

Suddenly, Ye Qingtang recalled that her sworn brother once passed her a blood token before he left.

“Is it this?”

Ye Qingtang took out the blood token from her space ring.

After seeing the token in Ye Qingtang’s hand, the expressions of Jiang Chen, Blood Demon, Shuo Tianzang, and the rest changed immediately.

That token… was not any Blood Moon Guardian… It was…

“We pay our respects to the Holy Lady!” Shuo Tianzang said first.

“I offended Holy Lady by accident. Please have mercy on me…”

The Blood Moon Division Head’s face paled, and his body weakened.

In the Blood Moon Sect, the Blood Moon Holy Lady held a supreme position, and even the Blood Moon Sect Master was required to bow in respect when he saw the Holy Lady!

However, Jiang Chen, Shuo Tianzang, and the rest could not understand why a dignified Blood Moon Holy Lady would downgrade her identity and pretend to be a Blood Moon Guardian. What exactly did she do that for?

“Blood Moon Holy Lady?” Ye Qingtang looked at the blood taken in her hand and pointed to herself instinctively. “Me?”

“Mhmm,” the Blood Moon Holy Lord said indifferently.

“Me??” Ye Qingtang thought she heard wrongly and asked again.

..” Blood Moon Holy Lord stared at her with a blank expression.

Ye Qingtang was rather confused, and she was in deep thought.

That day, she saved a man who fell from the sky and then… jokingly became sworn siblings with him and obtained a token. Immediately afterward, she became the Holy Lady of Blood Moon Sect from a sect disciple?

She really did not know if she should say that her luck was too amazing or that the Blood Moon Holy Lord was too casual and did anything he pleased.

It was the dignified Holy Lady of a sect, but he just gave it to her so casually?!

At that very moment, Ye Qingtang suddenly understood why the Blood Moon Elder could reach his initial position… Was this Blood Moon Holy Lord so casual in appointing people?

“Holy Lady… As the Blood Moon Holy Lady, why did you pretend to be a Blood Moon Guardian… This… This…” Jiang Chen felt that he simply could not understand the Blood Moon Holy Lady before him.

She was clearly already handpicked by the Holy Lord to be the Holy Lady, yet why did she still want to assume the identity of a Blood Moon Guardian?

Even though the Yunxiao Sect disciples pointed out Ye Qingtang’s identity earlier on, the Blood Moon Holy Lord was present at the scene currently, and Jiang Chen naturally believed his Holy Lord unconditionally.

What Xuanling Sect disciple or not. This was the Holy Lady of Blood Moon Sect!

Below in Xuanling Sect.

Elder Mo’s mouth hung ajar. His disciple, Ye Qingtang… was Blood Moon Sect’s… supreme Holy Lady… RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Xuanling Sect’s Sect Master, Elder Mo, and everyone else were stupefied as well. For a moment, they stopped thinking normally, their brains were completely blank.

Their Xuanling Sect had a Blood Moon Sect Holy Lady…

“The Blood Moon Holy Lady is my junior sister?” Qin Huan looked at Feng Moli beside him with wide eyes.

“Feng Moli… Am I dreaming? How about you give me a slap on my…” Qin Huan said.

Pow!

As Qin Huan finished his sentence, Feng Moli slapped Qin Huan immediately.

“Feng Moli… You… You… You were for real?!” Qin Huan touched his burning cheeks. Reality had proven that he was not dreaming, but wasn’t Feng Moli’s slap a little too ruthless!

Blood Moon Sect’s Holy Lady was really his junior sister. He was the Blood Moon Holy Lady’s senior brother!

“My junior sister is the Blood Moon Holy Lady! I am the Blood Moon Holy Lady’s senior brother!” Qin Huan exclaimed. Similarly, Zhu Changge was very agitated and in disbelief.
