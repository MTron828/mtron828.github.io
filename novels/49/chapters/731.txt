Yan Shu’s face was not very pleasant as well.

Suddenly, a pretty and skinny figure walked towards Yan Shu.

“Senior Brother Yan.”

Yan Shu looked towards the direction where the sound came from. “Junior Sister Yin.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The girl, Yin Qingluo, was also Perfected Xuanchen’s disciple.

“People of the Blue Cloud Peak are really too extreme.” Yin Qingluo frowned and said. She had witnessed the incident for a while. If not for her Master warning them that they could not find any trouble, she would definitely beat those disciples of the Blue Cloud Peak.

Yan Shu did not say anything, but his face clouded.

Yin Qingluo then noticed that there was a handsome young man standing beside Yan Shu. She was shocked by the young man’s appearance, but she frowned after a while.

“Senior Brother Yan, is this our Master’s new disciple?”

Yan Shu knew that Yin Qingluo was asking about Ye Qingtang. He nodded and said, “Yes. He is Ye Chen.”

“Senior Sister Yin.” Ye Qingtang folded her hands and said.

Ye Qingtang knew Yin Qingluo in her previous life. She was not kind at all despite her skinny features.

Yin Qingluo stared at Ye Qingtang. Her sight was not warm at all. She nodded perfunctorily and said towards Yan Shu, “The rumor is true then.”

“What rumor?” Yan Shu was confused.

“Before I came here, I just heard from other disciples that Master made an exception and took in a new disciple with a yellow spirit root. I thought that it was nonsense, however… Now, it seems that it’s true.” She was trying to be implicit. However, she knew that the new disciple got in through the back door.

Yan Shu pursed his lips but did not say anything.

Yin Qingluo did not continue, but her eyes that were staring at Ye Qingtang were filled with unpleasantness.

Perfected Xuanchen’s disciples all possessed, at minimum, green spirit roots. Now, there was a new disciple with a yellow spirit root, and he was not apprenticed by his ability. No one could treat him as their true Senior or Junior Brother.

Ye Qingtang noticed Yin Qingluo’s unpleasant sight, but she did not say anything.

She figured that the news of her being accepted by exception was spread out by Xiong Feng, who could not keep any secret. She might not be able to enter the eyes of the Admirable Sky Peaks, not mentioning the other peaks.

However…

She did not care about that.

She still had a long time here.

When Yin Qingluo was chatting with Yan Shu, Sheng Qianyu’s face was getting paler as he was challenged by the Blue Cloud Peak disciples.

Yin Qingluo was a straightforward person. She could not tolerate it anymore when she saw her Junior Brother of the same peak being bullied by others.

Yan Shu noticed Yin Qingluo’s move and said softly, “Don’t create any trouble.”

Yan Shu was angry in his heart, but he could not do anything based on his Master’s warning.

“I know what I’m doing.” Yin Qingluo nodded and walked out.

“Senior Brothers of the Blue Cloud Peak, Junior Brother Sheng is always an innocent person. He will never frame anyone for anything.”

The disciples of the Blue Cloud Peak looked towards Yin Qingluo as she walked out.

“Your words are funny, Junior Sister Yin. If Sheng Qianyu was saying the truth, you’re saying that we’re wrong? And we really took his thing by force?” The disciples of the Blue Cloud Peak sneered.

“Senior Sister Yin.” Sheng Qianyu stared at Yin Qingluo nervously as she was the only one who was willing to speak for him.
