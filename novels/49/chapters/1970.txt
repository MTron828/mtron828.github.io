Chapter 1971: Spy (3)

You Qiong’s mind churned as thoughts raced through it before he could even register them properly.

It was true that he would have nothing to worry about when he went back if she got rid of his curse, but...

“Of course, I’ve left a little present from the Undead Clan in you in case you feel an urge to betray us. The moment you feel like betraying us, I will make sure that you die a death so horrible there won’t be a body left to bury. It doesn’t matter even if I am thousands of miles away.” Ye Qingtang seemed to have figured out what he was thinking and she narrowed her eyes at him.

You Qiong trembled in fear when he heard this.

He wouldn’t have believed it if it were anyone else saying this, but he didn’t dare doubt the words coming out of the powerful Holy Lord of Shadows.

“Please have mercy, Holy Lord. How would I dare have the courage to betray you.” You Qiong pleaded with her on the surface but he was internally praying to his ancestors.

He knew that it wasn’t going to be this easy.

Ye Qingtang smiled.

“Don’t worry, I won’t joke around with your life. All you have to do is return to the Ancient You Clan. I will tell you what to do when we need you.”

You Qiong seemed to agree on the surface but it was actually a tough decision for him internally. If only he had known this earlier. Then he wouldn’t have followed the Jiang family here.

He was in a terrible position now. What right did he have to struggle now that his puny life was in the hands of the Holy Lord?

“Yes, I will obey all of the Holy Lord’s instructions.”

What other choice did he have?

Seeing that he had been thoroughly intimidated by her, Ye Qingtang activated the Deity Ocean within her and purged the curse from him.

In the blink of an eye, You Qiong transformed into a 60-year-old man with a face filled with wrinkles.

Even though he had regained his appearance, it was impossible for his powers to recover as quickly. In his current state, he was only half as powerful as he was in the past.

Once she had settled You Qiong, Ye Qingtang arranged for his return to the Ancient You Clan. But she herself had no idea how useful this move would be.

There was a huge gap between their current strength and the might of the Ancient You Clan. Even if You Qiong was able to get information about the Ancient You Clan, dealing with them would still be extremely difficult.

Ye Qingtang had been thinking nonstop about how to defeat the Ancient You Clan once she had dealt with You Qiong.

The Ancient You Clan had yet to make their move against the Temple of Shadows. But at the rate they were devouring the powerful people of the Central Mainland, the Temple of Shadows was going to be their final target soon.

It would be hard to avoid a massacre.

It was only a matter of time.

Ye Qingtang had too few cards on her side. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

With these thoughts flying around messily in her mind, Ye Qingtang walked back to her room with her head down. Because she had been afraid that the Jiang family would recognize the little white tiger, she had not had it by her side the past few days.

As she was about to push open the door to her room, a figure suddenly appeared behind her.

“Hold Lord, you seem to be agonizing over the Ancient You Clan.”

Ye Qingtang lifted her head as she heard this and saw Ling Yan smiling faintly at her.

She froze.

Just as she was about to speak, she saw Xue Fu walking by with a few Undead Clan guards on patrol. She kept her mouth shut and dragged Ling Yan into her room.

Xue Fu, who was on patrol, was left speechless.

What had he just witnessed?

“Guardian... that human...” an Undead Clan guard was stunned.
