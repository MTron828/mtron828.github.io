Chapter 2439: Devious Ploy (2)

As the thoughts continued to circle within her mind, Ye Qingtang felt a headache coming along.

At the end of the day, everything that had happened, whether it was part of some nefarious scheme or something else had nothing to do with her. All these were not carried out against her.

Ye Qingtang didn’t wish to get involved in a messy situation and had no intention of probing the matter.

In her previous life, Ye Qingtang had no grand illusions about the way of things. She had her own set of principles and stood aloof from matters that did not concern her.

But after being reborn, her principles from her previous life had once and again been broken.

Inside the Wailing Well, Ye Qingtang could have escaped in one piece but she chose to stay without any hesitation.

How could she abandon Qin Feng, Nangong Lie and the rest of them?

Ye Qingtang never treated the Netherworld Academy as her home, but even so, the President and Vice-President had treated her with true sincerity.

She admitted to herself that she could not just leave now and cut off all ties with the Netherworld Academy.

The harsh wind was bone-chillingly cold in the deep night. Atop a tall tree, Ye Qingtang slowly opened her eyes and gave a soft sigh.

The Wailing Well was just too strange. There was the ever-present threat of those above-Emperor level monsters. One could not let down one’s guard for even a second. Otherwise, death might have been served at any time.

In her previous life, she had lived a wretched existence.

Being reborn was the greatest gift from the heavens.

In this life, she had also experienced way too much and had also encountered all sorts of situations before. Was the Wailing Well more strange than the Dragon Vein mystic realm? More weird than the Immortal and Buddha mystic realm? More dangerous than all the life-and-death situations she had experienced in the First Mainland?

Ye Qingtang had high ambitions. She wanted to fully explore the wider martial arts world and find her birth parents. She also wanted to get to the bottom of the mystery behind her Heart of the Heavenly Dao. How could she die in this stupid Wailing Well? Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

This was just a stumbling block in her real path.

A stumbling block that was obstructing her raging ambitions.

Ye Qingtang swore that she would crush every single stumbling block that tried to prevent her from moving forward.

…

“The tremors have stopped.”

After some time, Ye Qingtang surveyed her surroundings as she muttered to herself.

Over the past few days, Ye Qingtang closely observed any changes on the ground surface. Every day, toward the latter part of the night, the tremors will lessen, and sometimes even come to a complete stop.

Although she had no idea what this meant, she did not care. All she wanted was to find Qin Feng, Nangong Lie and the rest. As for the changes underground and those above-Emperor level monsters, they were none of her business.

At this point, Ye Qingtang was standing atop the tall tree, surveying her surroundings. Every time the tremors completely stopped, those monsters would also halt their activity. The latter part of the night in the Wailing Well was comparatively safer.

There was a water spring several thousand meters away up ahead.

Without any hesitation, Ye Qingtang flew toward that spring.

It was dead silent in the deep night. There were no bird cries or cicadas singing. It was like they were completely cut off from nature. All that was left was the whistle of a passing cold wind.

As she had spotted the spring from afar, it didn’t appear too big. But when she arrived at the spot, Ye Qingtang realized that the water spring was ridiculously expansive. Even more astonishing was the fact that there were no traces of blood at all inside that spring.
