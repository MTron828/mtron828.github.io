After hearing Ye Qingtang’s words, everyone, even the Feng family members, all held strange expressions on their faces. Father Feng and Mother Feng looked at Ye Qingtang in confusion.

The Feng family patriarch frowned deeply and said to Ye Qingtang, “Miss Ye, if you can stall him for a while, the Feng family will work together… to take out the Forbidden Formation.

However, before the Feng Family patriarch could finish speaking, Ye Qingtang shook her head and said, “Patriarch, I said earlier that this is a private matter between myself and the Feng Yun family. It has nothing to do with the Feng family. Moreover, there’s no need for the Feng family to interfere. I

alone am enough.”

“You alone… are enough?!”

The Feng family stared at Ye Qingtang in disbelief. Did she know how powerful an Emperor-level practitioner was?!

It was truly a divine power that could turn the world upside down. Only those who had reached the Emperor level would be able to reach their fullest potential!

“Hahaha.”

In the air, the Feng Yun family patriarch smiled and stroked his long, snow-white beard. As he looked at Ye Qingtang playfully, he said, “You are really quite confident. In that case, don’t blame me for bullying the weak.”

As he spoke, the Feng Yun family patriarch raised his hand slightly. In that instant, a powerful and invincible Emperor-level force morphed into a tall mountain and pressed towards Ye Qingtang.

If it were anyone else, they would have been instantly shattered by the aura of this Emperor level force.

But—

Ye Qingtang remained rooted to the ground without any response. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Oh?” Seeing that his aura could not hurt Ye Qingtang, the elder in the sky finally became interested. A smile was on his face as he said, “It seems that I have underestimated you. No wonder you dared to attack an elder of the Feng Yun family and even killed him. You are still so young, It is indeed true that

the younger generation will surpass us in time.”

“If you repent now, I will spare your life.”

Ye Qingtang stood rooted to the ground with her hands behind her back. She looked up at the old man in the air.

‘The Feng Yun family patriarch was slightly taken aback by Ye Qingtang’s words. Repent? Everyone burst into laughter. In fact, the Feng Yun family fighters were clutching their stomachs in mirth.

This woman’s martial art strength was indeed extraordinary. The fact that she was able to kill an elder of the Feng Yun Family was enough to prove that. Even so, she was currently facing a true Emperor level. Yet, she dared to say such words.

Had she gone mad or was she too arrogant? Did she not know how terrifying Emperor level practitioners were?!

“A junior should be humble when speaking to an Emperor level.” In the sky, a murderous intent finally surfaced in the eyes of the Feng Yun family patriarch.

In the next second, the elder waved his arm and the ground under Ye Qingtang’s feet immediately trembled violently as if a natural disaster had arrived.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang was still unmoved. Everyone saw Ye Qingtang’s right leg tap the ground lightly and a muffled sound rang out. The shaking ground started to stabilize and finally stabilized.

“Divine powers?”

Seeing this, the Feng family patriarch’s pupils constricted.

This woman was actually able to fight against an Emperor level practitioner?!

Even a Ninth Heaven Level Divine Lord might not be able to accomplish this so easily

“Ki!”

The elder gave a cold shout.

The word “kill” turned into a blood-colored fog that swept across the earth and spread towards Ye Qingtang..
