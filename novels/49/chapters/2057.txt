Chapter 2058: Little You Yun (3)

Ye Qingtang’s mind raced at this critical moment. She quickly wiped the look of surprise off her face, composed herself, and said, “Leave? Have you forgotten who I am?”

Her tone was solemn and held traces of anger.

Ning Luo who was at the side had no idea why she had suddenly changed her tone and could only remain still. Little Luo Xue’s eyes wavered as he looked at the ‘Elder’ in front of him.

At that moment, she was still wearing Elder Mo’s face.

Little Luo Xue had been with the other Ancient You Clan forces before. When Ye Qingtang had gone to the Ancient You Clan valley to save the Jiang family, he had attacked them.

She guessed that he would’ve been raised by the Ancient You Clan forces. With his power, there was no way he had not seen Elder Mo before. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

He looked at her for a long time as he gradually recognized her. He withdrew his aura but continued staring at her in hostility.

“You shouldn’t be here.”

“Bullsh*t,” she said with a scoff as her face darkened.

“With the Crimson League and the Temple of Shadows at our door, this place is no longer safe. This girl holds the survival of our clan in her hands and cannot continue staying in this dangerous place.”

Little Luo Xue’s eyebrows furrowed slightly as he recalled what Elder Yuan had told him.

Elder Yuan had asked him to protect Little You Yun. He had instructed him to leave this place and seek the Ancient You Clan’s Grand Elder if they lost.

However...

Why were they moving Little You Yun when the battle had just started?

Did Elder Yuan have other arrangements?

Little Luo Xue was still young, and with his consciousness controlled by the Ancient You Clan, he couldn’t escape the shackles of the Ancient You Clan and his thinking was extremely narrow.

Furthermore, he had seen Elder Mo before.

“Elder Yuan ordered me to stay here and only leave with her if we lost,” he declared.

Even though he had said this, Ye Qingtang could sense doubt in his voice which made her sigh with relief inwardly. Fortunately for them, while Little Luo Xue was extremely powerful, he was still young and naive.

“Elder Yuan asked you to come here not to wait for her but to move her to someplace safe. Now that the Crimson League has discovered our location and we still don’t know who disclosed it, we cannot be sure that they won’t find her. So for the sake of her safety, we must move her elsewhere immediately. It won’t be too late to bring her back if we win but nothing is worse than losing her if we are defeated.” Ye Qingtang said all this with a straight face and solemn voice.

She perfectly mimicked Elder Mo when he was angry. His words were completely taken in by the naive little Luo Xue.

It seemed like...

Nothing was conflicting between Elder Yuan and Elder Mo’s words.

“There is no room for mistakes regarding her safety,” she emphasized.

Little Luo Xue’s eyes trembled as he heard the word ‘safety’. He gazed at the unconscious Little You Yun. Her safety was his top priority.

Ye Qingtang was still waiting for his response when Little Luo Xue suddenly flew to little You Yun’s side and pulled her to him. But the light around Little You Yun released its power again, pushing him away.

She was speechless.

Just three steps?

What a huge difference in treatment between them!
