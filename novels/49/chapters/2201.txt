Chapter 2202: Accusations (2)

Ye Qingtang deliberated for a moment before realizing that Jing Ze’s bloodline had probably awakened at that moment and harmed Zhang Qiqiu’s in return.

This was going to be a little troublesome.

Zhang Qiqiu was from the Shi family. Their family wouldn’t let Jing Ze go easily if they found out that he had damaged Zhang Qiqiu’s bloodline. Given that Jing Ze was from an ordinary family, there was no way he would be able to withstand the family clan’s attack.

“Do you have anything else to say?” Di Nuo scoffed coldly.

He had planned to find a way to kick Ye Qing out of the Netherworld Academy but now that Zhang Qiqiu’s bloodline was damaged, he was going to take this chance to kick her out immediately.

“Even though Jing Ze was powerless initially, he wasn’t a bad person. But he became cruel and vicious after studying under you. You don’t have any morals and shouldn’t be allowed in our academy.”

Ye Qingtang knew exactly what Di Nuo’s intentions were. She didn’t plan on staying in the Netherworld Academy for long anyway and was only here to use the Wind-Calming Pearl. She couldn’t leave now.

In addition...

She didn’t want to leave Jing Ze with so much trouble ahead.

“Since Jing Ze is my student and he damaged Zhang Qiqiu’s bloodline, I will take responsibility for it.”

“You dare take responsibility for it? There’s no way to heal a damaged bloodline, so how are you going to fix it?” Di Nuo snapped with a cold laugh.

She didn’t speak up immediately and looked at Teacher Luo who was standing at the side.

“I will take responsibility, but before that, I want to know what Teacher Luo meant about me making a mess in the medicine faculty.”

Di Nuo scoffed coldly.

Teacher Luo frowned slightly and looked at Ye Qingtang with a displeased expression.

“Teacher Ye, you wanted to borrow our alchemy lab a few days ago but when you were rejected, you went to Yun Chen’s alchemy lab instead. Isn’t that right?”

“That’s right,” Ye Qingtang said truthfully.

Teacher Luo nodded slightly. Seeing her admission, Teacher Luo turned to the Vice-President and said,

“Vice-President, we don’t care if the students want to let others use the alchemy lab, but there’s something we can’t overlook.”

With that, Teacher Luo’s eyes moved to Ye Qingtang and his gaze turned sharp. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Yun Chen is a student of the medicine faculty but it’s well known how difficult it is for him to improve due to his bloodline. But he suddenly brought over a cypress elixir yesterday and said that he had made it himself. It was tested by the teachers in the medicine faculty and we can confirm that it was something that couldn’t have been refined by him.”

“Teacher Ye, the medicine faculty has certain rules. To protect Yun Chen, you even gave him someone else’s cypress elixir to pass off as his own. We cannot let this pass!”

Ye Qingtang was angry yet pleased to hear his words.

“How do you know that it wasn’t refined by him?”

“Yun Chen has been in the medicine faculty for many years now and we are clear on the quality of the elixirs that he can refine. Just last month, he couldn’t even refine the bare minimum quality of elixirs. May I ask you how he could possibly improve so greatly in just a month?” Teacher Luo asked coldly.
