Ye Qingtang frowned slightly. She could not keep this Revolving Soul Orb anymore, and if the sect elders found out about it, it would be even harder for her to explain.

Then, Ye Qingtang suddenly looked up and walked forward.

“I have something to report.”

Elder Lin frowned while Elder Qin asked with a smile, “Is there anything?”

Under everyone’s gaze, Ye Qingtang immediately took out the Revolving Soul Orb from her space ring.

“The Blood Moon Sect Elder dropped this item when he left. I thought that this may be related to the Blood Moon Sect.”

The moment the Revolving Soul Orb was taken out, all the elders from different sects were attracted to it instantly.

“This is… the Revolving Soul Orb?!” A Wind Moon Sect elder was taken aback as shock filled his eyes.

The Revolving Soul Orb was an extremely-superior enchanted cultivation armament. It rarely appeared in sects, and only Wind Moon Sect had similar enchanted armament, of which was used to guard the sect. When the Blood Moon Sect was still in existence, its members were so powerful that ordinary sect disciples could not even be compared to them, causing everyone to bristle with anger. This power was mainly because the Blood Moon Sect possessed plenty of formidable enchanted armaments which others could not even imagine!

And the Revolving Soul Orb was one of the enchanted armaments!

Not just the Wind Moon Sect elder, but all the elders from different sects were shocked when they saw the Revolving Soul Orb.

Elder Lin and Elder Qin widened their eyes.

“This item was dropped by the Blood Moon Sect Elder?” Elder Lin asked with a serious expression.

Ye Qingtang replied. “Yes.”

Elder Qin ran a hand through his beard and raised a brow. “Legend has it that the Revolving Soul Orb is an enchanted armament at the state of Martial Qi Level Two and was also a mystical artifact that could allow someone at the peak of Martial Qi Level Two to breakthrough to Martial Qi Level Three. This item is extremely rare, and only the Blood Moon Sect could refine it. It should be right.”

Then, an infatuated expression emerged in the eyes of both Elder Qin and Elder Lin.

Both of them were at the late-stage of Martial Qi Level Two and were only a tiny gap away from the peak. If they could obtain this item, there was an opportunity for them to enter the Martial Qi Level Three state! Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Although Martial Qi Level Three and Martial Qi Level Two were only a grade apart, there was a world of differences between these two.

The emotions of both elders fell into Ye Qingtang’s eyes. Her lips curled up into a smile as a thought suddenly came to her. “I will present this item to the elders and hope that more clues regarding the Blood Moon Sect can be found using this item.” Then, Ye Qingtang walked to stand in front of the elders with the Revolving Soul Orb in her hands.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder was instantly dumbfounded.

At that instant, there was greed in both Elder Lin and Elder Qin’s eyes. They were not short of treasures given their high statues of an inner sect elder, but the Revolving Soul Orb was such a precious item that was ultimately beyond their reach.

Elder Lin took a deep breath quietly and lifted his chin while glancing at Elder Qin from the corner of his eyes.

He was the Elder of Xuanling Sect’s Sword Faction and had the highest position among the inner sect elders. Moreover, Ye Qingtang was a disciple in the outer sect Sword Faction, and it was logical that the Revolving Soul Orb should definitely end up in his possession.

Elder Qin realized this point as well, and his eyes revealed his slight disappointment. Had he known things would play out this way, he would have asked the outer sect elder to get in touch with Ye Qingtang since he thought very highly of her from the start anyway.

But now… it was too late.

Meanwhile, the elders from other sects had a gloomy expression, and their faces turned pale in anger as they looked at the Revolving Soul Orb in Ye Qingtang’s hand.

Their disciples and Xuanling Sect’s disciples both encountered the Blood Moon Sect Elder, but why was it that their disciples did not have such good luck? Not only did they not pick up such a precious treasure, they even lost their lives instead. It was seriously infuriating!
