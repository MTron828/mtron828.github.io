Chapter 692: So What If I Slap You (4)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“I don’t wish to do anything.” Ye Qingtang scoffed coldly. “Your son snatched my slave in public and wanted to kill me. How should we settle this score?”

As Shangguan Rui’s father, the Dragon-Tiger General was naturally aware of his son’s style.

But so what? Apart from those core disciples of super sects and the premier who could not be offended, who else could not be killed or beaten casually?!

“Fellow, release my son first!” the Dragon-Tiger General said coldly.

“Release him?” Ye Qingtang laughed. “It’s not impossible. However, you need to give me one hundred thousand Spirit Stones as compensation.”

To Ye Qingtang, it had nothing to do with her how surly or brutal Shangguan Rui was. In the past three hundred years in her life, she had met too many of such people and incidents… She already could not be bothered with such people, but the pretext was that the person must not offend her.

Ye Qingtang auctioned according to the black market rules, yet Shangguan Rui actually wanted to kill her.

Now that the Dragon-Tiger General ordered Ye Qingtang to release Shangguan Rui, it was not impossible. As long as she was given appropriate compensation, she might make some considerations.

“What did you say?!” The Dragon-Tiger General Shangguan Ze glared angrily.

Even if it was one hundred thousand inferior-grade Spirit Stones, it was not an amount that he could fork out!

“Why? Find it too many?” Ye Qingtang scoffed coldly. “Your bastard son ignored the rules of the black market. He could not win by wealth and wanted to kill me for no reason. It is reasonable for me to ask one hundred thousand Spirit Stones from you.”

Everyone at the scene exchanged a look.

This outsider was too bold. It was already a death crime for him to beat Shangguan Rui up like that, and now he still dared to threaten the Dragon-Tiger General! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Even if his spirit animal was extremely powerful, it would not be able to defeat thousands of Dragon-Tiger warriors.

“Fellow. Do you know exactly what you’re doing and saying?” The Dragon-Tiger General’s eyes were cold.

There was actually someone in this monarch city who dared to hit his son and threaten him…

“Father, you must kill this son of a bitch and dismember him. Find out his family clan and kill all of them!” Shangguan Rui’s eyes were filled with insanity.

Pow!

Ye Qingtang swung a palm out and slapped Shangguan Rui heavily.

Blood seeped out from the corners of his lips as he glared at Ye Qingtang menacingly. “This son of a bitch… You will have an extremely tragic death! All your loved ones, friends… Everyone will die because of your ignorance!”

A cold gleam flickered in Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

Initially, if that Dragon-Tiger General was willing to compensate, Ye Qingtang could still consider sparing this person’s life.

But currently, it seemed that there was no such need anymore.

“Release my son Shangguan Rui immediately. Otherwise, you’re not the only one who will suffer!” When the Dragon-Tiger General saw Ye Qingtang hitting his son, he clenched his fists tightly, wishing he could tear Ye Qingtang into pieces.

“Ha…” Ye Qingtang’s lips curled up slightly into a sinister smile. “Since that’s the case, there’s nothing to discuss between us already.”

After that, Ye Qingtang clutched Shangguan Rui’s neck.

In the next second, all everyone saw was that Shangguan Rui was held in the air by Ye Qingtang.

Shangguan Rui could not breathe properly in Ye Qingtang’s grip. His limbs swung wildly, and his eyes slowly became bloodshot. However, no matter what, he was unable to escape from Ye Qingtang’s grip.
