“Warden Xiong will be here shortly. Please wait for a while.” The disciple smiled and said.

“Warden Xiong? Is his name Xiong Feng?” Ye Qingtang suddenly asked.

“Yes.”

Ye Qingtang had spent quite a long time at the Falling Sky Valley in her previous life. Xiong Feng, warden Xiong, was someone she knew…

Ye Qingtang smiled secretly. Things would be much easier if the man was Xiong Feng.

Within a short while, a tall middle-aged man with a full beard came over. The patrolling disciples stepped forward when they saw him. They introduced Ye Qingtang and then continued with their patrolling duties.

Xiong Feng stared at the pretty young man in front of him. His eyes were filled with patience, and he said, “Why do you come to the Falling Sky Valley?”

“I am Ye Chen, and I want to enter the Falling Sky Valley as a disciple,” Ye Qingtang said directly.

When she just finished her words, Xiong Feng’s face was extremely impatient. He sized up the young man in front of him and waved his hand. “There’s still half a month’s time to the assessment time for new disciples who wish to enter the Falling Sky Valley. Why do you come so early? Go back and wait. Come here after half a month.”

Xiong Feng then intended to leave as he felt irritated. He was still thinking about why the disciples asked him to come out, but he did not expect that it was for this young man who wished to enter the Falling Sky Valley.

A smile flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes as she saw Xiong Feng about to leave. She immediately took out a bottle of elixirs from her space ring and stepped forward.

“Please wait, Warden Xiong.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Did I not tell you to come back in half a month? What do you still want…” Xiong Feng turned his head impatiently, but he suddenly saw Ye Qingtang handing over a bottle of elixirs to him.

Xiong Feng’s eyes flickered. He stopped and stared at Ye Qingtang with hesitation.

“This is…”

Ye Qingtang smiled and passed the elixirs to Xiong Feng. “Warden Xiong, this is the Luyuan Pill. It’s very expressive to strengthen your body and your strength. Please accept it.”

“Luyuan Pill?” Xiong Feng’s eyes brightened. He focused on the physique in cultivation and required elixirs. He had heard of the Luyuan Pill before. It was very rare, and normal elixir workshops were not able to refine it. There was supply from a few super sects only. It could be considered a rare and priceless item.

Xiong Feng did not believe Ye Qingtang’s words instantly. He opened the bottle and sniffed. As the fragrance entered his nose, his eyes were brighter.

It’s really the Luyuan Pill?

Xiong Feng held the elixirs in his hand. As he raised his eyes and looked towards Ye Qingtang again, the impatience disappeared and was replaced by a smile.

“Ye Chen, right? How can I accept such things?” Though that was what he said, Xiong Feng had kept the Luyuan Pill in his pockets as he spoke.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes were filled with a smile as she saw Xiong Feng’s move.

The easiest person who could be bribed in the Falling Sky Valley would be warden Xiong. Though he was tall and strong, he was keen on gaining petty advantages.

“Ye Chen, I can feel your determination to enter the Falling Sky Valley. Since the mountains here are hard to climb and there’s only half a month left till the assessment, I shall arrange a place for you to stay outside the valley. You’ll stay there for half a month and join the rest of the candidates after half a month.” Xiong Feng’s tone was much gentler.
