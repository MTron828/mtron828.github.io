Chapter 970 The Match (2)

“How boastful. I wonder who the people we beat until they howled like stray dogs were. Now, they dare to crawl out of the Ye House and raise a clamor,” the youths from the Duan Family said coldly.

The youths from both families were hot-blooded. Sparks were already flying before the match could begin. They rolled up their sleeves and almost sparred on the spot.

At that moment, the Lin Town citizens who had crowded around to watch were filled with anticipation.

One must know that after the Duan Family had sought refuge with the Long Family, the ability of the Duan Family’s disciples had far outstripped that of the Si and Ye Families. In their previous fights, the Duan Family had been completely victorious.

Now, the Ye Family had publicly accepted the Duan Family’s challenge. However, the ability of this Dan Yifan from the Ye Family was still unknown.

In terms of ability, Duan Luoning was one of the best in Lin Town. Except for the Long Family, almost none of the younger members of the other major families could compare with him.

Even the Eldest Young Master of the Si Family, Si Ye, had been defeated by Duan Luoning.

Everyone knew that because of the Long Family, the Duan Family had begun to oppress the other two major families. They had even borrowed the Long Family’s name and demanded tribute from many of the other major families. If the Ye Family was defeated in today’s battle, the matter of tribute could no longer be avoided.

The two major families were previously on par, but one was now superior to the other. To pay tribute to the other was not just about money but also about the family’s dignity.

“If the Ye Family loses today’s match, you must pay a monthly tribute to the Duan Family from now on. Do you dare to take on this bet?” Duan Luoning said coldly as he looked at Dan Yifan.

“Why wouldn’t I dare? Similarly, if the Duan Family loses…” Dan Yifan narrowed his eyes slightly.

“Naturally, it will be the same.” Duan Luoning replied crisply.

With that, Dan Yifan’s lips curved in a trace of a confident smile.

A cold light immediately flashed across the eyes of the two opponents.

In that instant, they acted almost simultaneously.

A flash of cold light suddenly exploded from Duan Luoning’s hand!

“Glacial Frost Palm?!”

Below the dais, the crowd watched as blasts of cold air spurted from Duan Luoning’s palm. The temperature of the surrounding area seemed to drop under the force of his palm.Visit website our Listnovel.com

Icy blue cold air seemed to gather in Duan Luoning’s palm. It seemed to imperceptibly transform into a glacial ice dragon that suddenly charged at Dan Yifan.

The form of the glacial ice dragon was reflected in Dan Yifan’s eyes. A chill suddenly surfaced in his eyes.

The next instant, he suddenly drew the Blazing Sun Sword at his waist. Roaring hot flames immediately rushed out from his blade!

With a stroke of his sword, an endless stream of blazing flames rushed out with a howl, seemingly setting the air on fire. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The two savage and cruel forces suddenly collided in mid-air. The glacial ice churned under the blazing flames, and steam began to spread.

It was as if the surrounding audience was being roasted or burnt by the hot steam.

The hot flames swallowed the glacial ice dragon and bombarded Duan Luoning with a resounding explosion.

The group from the Ye Family below the dais widened their eyes in excitement as they saw the hot flames rushing away.

“Young Master Dan, kill that Duan Family bastard!”

“Kill him! Let’s see if he dares to be so arrogant!”

Amidst the mingled shouts, Duan Luoning was startled to see the oncoming hot flames. The next instant, he drew the sharp sword at his side. The cold air in his palm gathered on the sword blade and blocked the roaring hot flames!
