Chapter 2645 Temple Holy Lord (2)

Everyone in the Divine Venerate Domain knew about the Great Immortal Temple.

There was no need to elaborate on the temple’s reputation. The Great Immortal Temple was one of the top supreme factions in the present world and there were not many factions who could compare to them.

However, the people from the Great Immortal Temple had already been stationed there since news of the Fourth Domain legacy spread. They had already entered the depths a few days ago. Now, this woman had appeared out of nowhere and was claiming she was from the Great Immortal Temple. It was truly laughable.

However, in order not to cause too much trouble, the Worldly Emperor level practitioner stared at Ye Qingtang and smiled. “Alright, since you say that you are from the Great Immortal Temple, show me the Great Immortal Temple token. If you can take it out, we will let you in, but…”

At that point, a cold glint surfaced in the eyes of that Worldly Emperor level practitioner. He stared at Ye Qingtang and continued, “But if you can’t take it out, it means you actually dared to pretend to be from the Great Immortal Temple. Not only will you be unable to enter, but you will also probably die here.”

The impatience in Ye Qingtang’s eyes intensified.

The Worldly Emperor level practitioner was asking for her to show the Great Immortal Temple token, which would prove she was really from the temple.

No one in the outside world knew about Ye Qingtang’s status as a disciple of the Nine Heavens Saint. There was also no way Ye Qingtang would take out the token just for anybody.

“What? You don’t have it?!”

Seeing that Ye Qingtang remained unmoving, a Ninth Heaven Level Divine Lord middle-aged man standing beside the Worldly Emperor level cultivator glared at Ye Qingtang coldly and snorted. “Scram.” Ye Qingtang lost all her patience.

“You are courting death!”

Everyone, including the Worldly Emperor level expert, was enraged by Ye Qingtang’s words. This woman was really audacious. Not only did she pretend to be someone from the Great Immortal Temple, she even wanted to barge into their midst.

However, before Ye Qingtang could say anything else, the heads of the Worldly Emperor level practitioner and his men were instantly torn apart, spraying blood everywhere.

Ye Qingtang frowned. She could have done it, but she definitely did not attack. She did not kill the Worldly Emperor level practitioner and his men.

“Ah!”

Before Ye Qingtang could think further, miserable cries sounded from afar.

Almost instinctively, Ye Qingtang looked into the distance. Just that one glance made Ye Qingtang’s expression change. An extremely beautiful woman dressed in white appeared like a holy halo. Her entire body emitted a terrifying aura. Her eyes seemed to contain no human emotions. Anyone who dared to stand in her way would be instantly killed.

However, to Ye Qingtang’s surprise, that woman… looked exactly like her. They were completely identical!

Ye Qingtang was bewildered. Why did this woman look like her?!

However, although they looked the same on the outside, Ye Qingtang’s martial art skills could not be compared to this woman. If Ye Qingtang guessed correctly, this woman had probably already reached the Immortal Emperor level.

An Immortal Emperor could topple everything with a single thought. She was an existence that stood at the peak of the martial arts world.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎
