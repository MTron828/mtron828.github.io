Chapter 2277: Secret Room (1)

That feeling…

It was like it could not see Ye Qingtang at all, but could only feel her aura behind that wall.

What was going on?

Ye Qingtang was puzzled. Even in her previous life, Ye Qingtang did not hear anything about this secret room. Not only that…

In her previous life, apart from the Night Soul Beasts, there had been no information regarding the black snake either. If Ye Qingtang hadn’t personally experienced it, she had no idea that a black snake existed inside the treasure trove.

What the hell went wrong? Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Could it be that several hundred years later, the black snake had already disappeared by the time the various factions entered the fiendcelestial’s tomb?

And what about this secret room?

Ye Qingtang felt increasingly puzzled.

This black snake’s powers were terrifying. It could easily kill even an Emperor level practitioner and so many Night Soul Beasts only managed to delay it for a short while.

But this secret room was able to completely block the black snake…

After confirming that the black snake could not see her and could not enter the secret room, Ye Qingtang finally turned her attention to this room.

There was nothing inside.

But an ancient and mysterious-looking array formation was drawn on the floor.

Looking at the patterns drawn on eight sides of the array formation, Ye Qingtang found them strangely familiar.

Weren’t they the patterns she had seen in the Night Soul Beasts’ cave earlier?

But the patterns in the cave had been singular while in this secret room, they were merged into an array formation.

“What kind of array formation is this?” Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes. This pattern was strangely familiar. She felt like she had also seen this somewhere else apart from the cave.

But for the moment, Ye Qingtang could not recall the exact location.

Separated by a single wall, the black snake was still trying to get into the secret room. But this secret room seemed to possess a special power, completely sealing the snake off on the outside.

With the black snake keeping guard outside the hole, there was no way Ye Qingtang would go through it. So she just sat down cross-legged and took out the Evil Fruit from her space ring.

The Evil Fruit was pitch-black and laid quietly in Ye Qingtang’s hand.

Ye Qingtang shook her head.

She had risked her life for this Evil Fruit.

Now that she had it, Ye Qingtang didn’t intend to waste it. Since she couldn’t leave for now, she might as well use this Evil Fruit first.

Holding the Evil Fruit between her palms and crossing all 10 fingers, Ye Qingtang shut her eyes and slowly guided the Evil Fruit’s energy toward her heart.

Time passed by the second which slowly stretched into minutes.

The Evil Fruit’s energy was gradually being absorbed by Ye Qingtang. That energy transformed into a shapeless aura, slowly seeping into the Heart of the Heavenly Dao.

The seal, which had been loose for some time, started to mend with the infusion of that aura. It was like a net being gradually weaved. Bit by bit, the Heart of the Heavenly Dao’s aura was once again sealed off.

Completely focused on sealing her Heart of the Heavenly Dao, Ye Qingtang didn’t notice that wisps of foggy air had suddenly appeared. As Ye Qingtang guided the Evil Fruit’s energy, that fog moved away from the array formation and started being absorbed into her body!

Standing by the side, the Night Soul Beast was filled with shock at the sight.

But Ye Qingtang was concentrating on taking care of her Heart of the Heavenly Dao now and did not notice anything at all.
