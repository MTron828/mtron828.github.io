Chapter 382: My Person (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Fei Ying’s eyes suddenly widened as he stared at Ni Shang in disbelief.

“You…”

Ni Shang laughed bitterly and broke free from Fei Ying’s grip. “Take good care of Miss for me. It is me who doesn’t have this blessing. I’ve troubled Miss.” Then, Ni Shang immediately headed out of the courtyard without turning back.

“Ni Shang!” Fei Ying was alarmed.

Ni Shang did not stop in her tracks at all. She walked to the entrance of the courtyard and pushed open the gate. Looking at the misty dark night, she knew that there was no return when she took this step.

However…

She did not regret.

Fei Ying panicked and instinctively wanted to rush up and stop her.

However, the tightly-shut door behind him suddenly opened, and a figure shuffled out behind him.

Just as Ni Shang was about to step out of the courtyard, a wet hand pulled her back into the courtyard hard, and a slender leg directly kicked the door shut!

With a clear bang, the gate was closed once again.

Ni Shang, who was dizzy by the sudden motion, was pressed on the gate with an arm.

“Where are you going?” A rather raspy voice sounded in Ni Shang’s ears.

Ni Shang looked up in surprise and saw…

Ye Qingtang, who was wearing only a thin garment, trapped her at the gate with an arm.

The faint moonlight cast on Ye Qingtang in the hazy night. Her damp hair hung loosely at the side of her face as drops of water fell from her hair ends. At that moment, her clear eyes were slightly narrowed as though her eyes were a galaxy—deep yet dreamy.

The pair wondrous of eyes were fixed on the astonished Ni Shang.

“Mi… Miss…” Ni Shang’s lips quivered as she looked at the stunning face near hers.

“Listen well.” Ye Qingtang lowered her head a little. Her breaths brushed across the tip of Ni Shang’s nose. Suddenly, she lifted Ni Shang’s chin with her wet fingers and stared right into Ni Shang’s eyes.

“You are my person. I will definitely not allow you to do anything that will harm yourself. Do you hear it?”

Ni Shang looked at Ye Qingtang, dazed.

Ye Qingtang silently pulled apart from Ni Shang and turned to face Fei Ying, who had blanked out behind her.

“Watch Ni Shang properly. If she sneaks out tonight, I will strip you naked and put you on display outside the courtyard.”

Fei Ying suddenly returned to his senses. Looking at Ye Qingtang who was bathing in the moonlight and hearing her warning, he swallowed his saliva.

Miss, you’re as gentle as a spring wind to Ni Shang but so heartless like a storm to me…

You cannot favor girls and not boys!

Although these thoughts ran in his head, Fei Ying still ran over and pulled Ni Shang aside.

Ni Shang returned to her senses and was about to say something, but Ye Qingtang covered Ni Shang’s tiny mouth.

“If you’re really worried, you and Fei Ying can just go to the ring tomorrow to watch.”

Ni Shang blinked. Confusion filled her eyes as she stared at Ye Qingtang, who exuded a devilish air. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Miss… seems to be a little different from usual.

Ye Qingtang gave Fei Ying a look, and he immediately dragged Ni Shang away, watching over her as per Ye Qingtang’s orders.

Under the moonlight, Ye Qingtang looked up slightly, and she lazily stretched her body when the moonlight fell on her face.

“This cultivation method is really deadly.”

However…

Its effects were satisfying.

Becoming more powerful was not to bully the weak but to protect the people around you.

Ye Qingtang looked down at her palm, and the corners of her lips tugged into an evil smile.

Song Junqiu, the few of you can just clean your necks and wait for death tomorrow!
