To the Hall of Justice, it was not important whether Ji Yixuan had really stolen the Full Moon Sutra. What was important was that Ji Yixuan was related to the Valley Master and that they were part of the Full Moon Peak.

Clank!

Ji Yixuan suddenly drew the sword at his waist.

“Are you really going to resist?!”

When they saw that, the wardens of the Hall of Justice and Xuanyuan Lie laughed coldly.

If Ji Yixuan resisted, they could kill him on the spot. Then, the Valley Master, Perfected Xuanchen would not be able to retain his position for much longer.

“Yan Shu!”

Ji Yixuan looked at Yan Shu. “Tell my Master that I, Ji Yixuan, have been honest and above-board all my life. I have never done anything deceitful… Today, I, Ji Yixuan, have been maligned by the Full Moon Peak. This incident is merely a ruse by the Full Moon Peak in its bid for power… Ask my Master to be careful… I will leave first!”

As he said that, Ji Yixuan brandished his sword upward. His face was filled with determination. He would use his death to prove his innocence. He would not allow Perfected Xuanchen and the others to be besmirched in any way by him!

“What?!”

When he saw what was happening, Yan Shu’s expression changed. Ji Yixuan’s long sword was already at his neck. He was too fast, and although Yan Shu tried to stop him, it was too late.

However, at that moment, Ye Qingtang flicked her wrist. No one saw what Ye Qingtang did, but the longsword in Ji Yixuan’s hand was instantly struck to the ground.

“Junior sister…”

Ji Yixuan looked at Ye Qingtang in shock. He did not know why Ye Qingtang had stopped him.

Ye Qingtang looked at Ji Yixuan, who had resolved to die. She could not help but sigh inwardly. This Senior Brother Ji was too straightforward.

Ye Qingtang laughed softly.

“If you didn’t do it, why use your death to prove it? It’s not worth it.”

Yan Shu was also shocked. He had not thought that this Yang Lord would act in time to rescue Ji Yixuan…

“How dare you!”

At that moment, a warden of the Hall of Justice glared at Ye Qingtang in rage. “Who are you to impede the Hall of Justice?!”

When he saw what was happening, Yan Shu wanted to speak out and stop them. But he thought for a moment and remained silent in the end.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang was looking at the Warden. Her eyes were expressionless. “Are you talking to me?”

“Bring both Ji Yixuan and this girl back to the Hall of Justice. Now, I suspect that the two of them were in cahoots to steal the Full Moon Peak’s Full Moon Sutra!” The warden of the Hall of Justice shouted coldly.

When she heard that, Ye Qingtang smiled and nodded slightly. “I never thought that in this day and age, there is still someone who dares to speak to a Lord like that.”

Ye Qingtang’s words surprised everyone.

Who did this girl think she was to call herself… a Lord?!

Only a Yin Yang Perfected Lord could be called a Lord…

The next moment, the force of a Yang Lord shot skyward.

In an instant, it shrouded the entire Falling Sky Valley. It was as if a Lord Demon from Hell had descended. A blood-colored light flashed through the entire void. Under the supreme force of a Yang Lord, everyone present started to shudder violently as their pupils constricted.

At that moment, the Full Moon Peak’s Xuanyuan Yi, the various senior disciples, and the wardens of the Hall of Justice were completely stunned. They stared at Ye Qingtang in disbelief.

“Yang… Yang… Yang… Yang Lord…?!”

One of the wardens of the Hall of Justice felt that the earth had split and that the sky had fallen. It was like the end of the world.

He had actually tried to capture a… Yang Lord…

No one had taken any notice of Ye Qingtang. They had just assumed that this girl was an ordinary disciple of the Falling Sky Valley. However, at that moment, they all realized that this beautiful girl was… an invincible Yang Lord!
