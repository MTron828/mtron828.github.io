Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang felt that this big yellow dog must have seen through to her Heart of the Heavenly Dao. Perhaps it knew something that she did not. Ye Qingtang was very curious about this and wondered if the big yellow dog could tell her something about the Heart of the Heavenly Dao.

The big yellow dog sized up Ye Qingtang’s chest for a long time before retracting its gaze.

“Little girl, you’re quite extraordinary. There are many things I am not sure of, but there’s one thing I can be certain of. You’ll bring about a fatal calamity upon yourself. This is a calamity you will have to endure,” the big yellow dog said.

“I will bring about a fatal calamity upon myself?” Ye Qingtang was even more confused after hearing the yellow dog’s words. What did the yellow dog mean?

“Besides, you’re an unlucky person. Truly unlucky. I don’t mean that you will cause the death of the people around you, but you will bring bad luck to them,” the big yellow dog continued.

“That’s good…” The Blood Moon Elder said instinctively.

Ye Qingtang glanced at the Blood Moon Elder who looked rather embarrassed. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Then, do you know its origin?” Ye Qingtang pointed at the position of her heart.

“I’m not sure about that… but the Karma bloodline race should know,” the big yellow dog said after a moment of silence.

“Karma Bloodline… race?” Ye Qingtang was a little surprised.

Ling Yan was the only one who had the Karma bloodline in this world. Yet, the big yellow dog claimed that there was an entire race. How was that possible?

“However, you must not let those monsters from the Karma Bloodline Clan see you. Otherwise, they will definitely kill you to put an end to future troubles. Hmm… probably.”

“Brother Canine, you’re being too vague. Can you be more direct? What terminal illness does my Holy Lady have? Can you treat her? Is she suffering from bad luck?” The Blood Moon Elder asked anxiously.

Ye Qingtang looked at the Blood Moon Elder in exasperation. Could he not describe her situation in such dire terms?

“How would I know? I’ll use a karmic technique to divine her,” said the yellow dog.

“You know the karmic technique?” Ye Qingtang was surprised.

“I have a grudge with the Karma Bloodline Clan. In the past, a few of them fell into my hands. I forced them to teach me a little of the karmic techniques. After teaching me, I killed them,” said the big yellow dog.

Ye Qingtang, “…”

In that instant, Ye Qingtang started to worry about Ling Yan. Would this big yellow dog want to kill Ling Yan too…

The big yellow dog stood at the side and used its paws to dig at the dust on the ground. It mumbled some unintelligible mystic words, looking very much like a charlatan.

After a long time, the big yellow dog looked at Ye Qingtang again with an indescribably strange expression.

“What’s the matter? What came about from the divination?” Ye Qingtang was baffled to see the yellow dog looking at her so strangely.

“Strange, it’s too strange. That’s impossible… how could something like that happen? Could I have miscalculated?” the big yellow dog asked.

Although its karmic technique was not that good, it could still come up with an approximate divination. However, when was used on Ye Qingtang, her fate was illusory and very strange.

No. The big yellow dog refused to believe it. It used its karmic technique again, but the result was the same.

“I calculated a few times… you might not believe me if I tell you.” The big yellow dog looked at Ye Qingtang.. “You… will want to kill yourself.”
