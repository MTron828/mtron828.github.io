“Don’t Su Wan and Yun Shu have a thing for each other? Why did she say such a thing here?”

“Since Su Wan said so, I think that Yun Shu’s words most likely cannot be trusted. After all, Junior Sister Su has always adored Yun Shu, and if such a thing really happened, would Junior Sister Su deny it?”

Su Wan’s words made many felt that Yun Shu was slandering Lu Xiuwen intentionally.

Everyone knew of Su Wan and Yun Shu’s relationship. If there truly were such a thing, Su Wan would definitely stand on Yun Shu’s side.

However, a hint of satisfaction flashed across Lu Xiuwen’s eyes.

Yun Shu widened his eyes in disbelief and looked at Su Wan, who was avoiding his eyes. Whatever he said earlier was not a lie. When Lu Xiuwen called him, he clearly exchanged a look with Su Wan, and she did see him leaving together with Lu Xiuwen. Why was it that… at this very moment, Su Wan denied everything?!

Yun Shu simply could not believe that Su Wan, who had always followed him throughout these days, would backstab him at this critical moment.

Su Wan did not return Yun Shu’s gaze and only looked down to avoid everything. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

She did witness Lu Xiuwen and Yun Shu leaving together, but… so what? Yun Shu was already crippled now…

While Lu Xiuwen…

Su Wan looked up at Lu Xiuwen’s back view, and her mind replayed the scene where Lu Xiuwen expressed his affection for her on their way back to the sect. Lu Xiuwen was a royal from the Formidable Heavens Royals, and his identity was as prestigious as Yun Shu’s. Now, Yun Shu had become disabled while Lu Xiuwen… had a bright future ahead of him.

Yun Shu stood rooted to the ground, dumbfounded. His last ray of hope was shattered the moment Su Wan spoke.

A hint of laughter darted across Lu Xiuwen’s eyes. Then, he looked at the pale Yun Shu and said, “Junior Brother Yun, I know that you suffered a lot this time, and I am very upset as well, but I don’t know why must you malign me like this.”

Then, Lu Xiuwen showed a pained expression.

“Lu Xiuwen… when did I malign you? How can you…” Yun Shu trembled in fury when he saw Lu Xiuwen’s attitude, and blood flowed out from the cut that was not yet healed.

Su Wan’s words simply pushed Yun Shu into a bottomless abyss.

No matter how he explained now, no one would believe him.

Lu Xiuwen looked at the warden and added on. “Warden, all the disciples who participated in this mission can testify that I never left the group by myself.”

Then, those disciples who were standing aside nodded along.

Yun Shu looked at the farce before his eyes and let out a bitter laugh. A drop of blood escaped his mouth as he shut his eyes in pain.

The warden frowned slightly. Yun Shu had violated the sect rules by maligning Lu Xiuwen. “Yun Shu, what do you still have to say now?”

Yun Shu shook his head slowly. Everyone was testifying for Lu Xiuwen, and no one would believe him at all no matter how he explained.

Human or devil, he finally saw clearly.

The warden announced coldly. “For maligning a fellow disciple in the sect, you are to be flogged thirty strokes. On the account that your injuries are severe, you are to head to the Disciplinary Hall by yourself to receive the punishment once you recover.”

“Yes…” Yun Shu said with a bitter laugh.

The smile in Lu Xiuwen’s eyes deepened.

“Warden, I have something to report.” Suddenly, a beautiful female voice traveled into everyone’s ears.
