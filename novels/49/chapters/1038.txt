Chapter 1039 It’s You (2)

“Ye Qingtang… it’s indeed you.”

A Yunxiao Sect elder looked at Ye Qingtang and scoffed.

Ye Qingtang did not react to him and merely unsheathed a sword from her waist.

“Hahaha…”

Seeing that Ye Qingtang drew a sword out, the few Yunxiao Sect elders on the back of the Sect Protector Divine Beast immediately burst out in laughter.

Could it be that this Ye Qingtang still wanted to put up a last fight with them?

Swoosh!

Nonetheless, before the Yunxiao Sect elders finished laughing, the smiles were completely frozen on their faces as disbelief and horror filled their eyes.

As Ye Qingtang waved her sword, the frightening aura of a Yang Lord surged into the sky, and the sword aura completely enveloped the Yunxiao Sect Protector Divine Beast.

Sensing this unbelievable aura, even the Yunxiao Sect Protector Divine Beast trembled.

Boom Boom!!

A loud roar erupted in the next second. Before the shocked Xuanling Sect masses, the enormous body of the Sect Protector Divine Beast instantly erupted into mists of blood, and the several Yunxiao Sect elders died along with it at the scene.

After slaughtering the Yunxiao Sect Protector Divine Beast and Yunxiao Sect elders with one slash, Ye Qingtang immediately turned around and landed in Xuanling Sect.

“This…”

At this instant, Xuanling Sect was enshrouded in the supreme energy of a Yang Lord, and those disciples with weak pulses and even those who fainted from hunger were immediately energized.

“Junior… Junior Sister Ye?”

Qin Huan and the rest were stunned when they saw Ye Qingtang descending from the sky. Was this lady who was brimming with a Yang Lord energy really Ye Qingtang?!

It had been less than half a year since they were separated from Ye Qingtang, and she had already become one of the few powerful Yang Lords of this mainland in this period of time?

“Qingtang?”

Similarly, Elder Mo found this hard to swallow. No matter what, Elder Mo could not believe that Ye Qingtang had actually grown this much in less than half a year.

“Master, it’s been long. I’m late.”

Ye Qingtang looked at Elder Mo and bowed with cupped fists.

Back then in Xuanling Sect, she took Elder Mo as her master, and he treated her pretty well. Naturally, Ye Qingtang would not forget him.

A whole ten minutes later, Elder Mo finally returned to his senses and nodded rather absentmindedly.

“Are you really Ye Qingtang?” Elder Qin was clearly shaken as he looked at the lady before him. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

A Yang Lord was someone whose martial cultivation base was at least at Yin Yang Perfected Lord Seventh Heaven-an absolutely unrivaled figure on this mainland.

Not mentioning a Yang Lord, it would also be unbelievable for Elder Qin even if Ye Qingtang showed up as Yin Lord.

“It’s me.” Ye Qingtang nodded in agreement.

“Sh*t…”

Qin Huan walked to Ye Qingtang’s side and inspected Ye Qingtang closely. “How can this be… Junior Sister Ye, you… you’re actually… Could it be that I’m hallucinating because I’m too hungry?”

Ye Qingtang was speechless. However, it was not strange for Qin Huan to say such things given his personality.

“Senior Brother Qin, it really is me,” affirmed Ye Qingtang.

“But… Yang Lord… This is…”

Qin Huan and the rest found it hard to believe at the moment.

However, Ye Qingtang did not wish to discuss this matter too much as it was not something that could be explained clearly in a few sentences after all.

Seeing that Ye Qingtang was unwilling to talk about it, everyone understood what to do and no longer mentioned it.

Ye Qingtang immediately retrieved plenty of food and water from her space ring and told Qin Huan and the rest to distribute them.
