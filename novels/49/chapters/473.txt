She returned after taking a few steps.

The man was extremely weak now, and any cultivator could kill him easily.

Ye Qingtang contemplated for a while and thought that it was not very appropriate to just leave.

“Okay. Anyway, it was my fault to have the intention of taking away your space ring. As compensation… I will guard you until you wake up.” Ye Qingtang sat down beside the man.

Ye Qingtang then took out some healing medicine from her space ring that she brought from the sect. She then poured them into the man’s mouth.

Ye Qingtang took some clean water and fed him as she saw that the man’s mouth was dry.

Ye Qingtang took care of the man for about two days. There was finally some color on his face. The blood moon at the glabella was more obvious…

Ye Qingtang was too exhausted and decided to take a nap. However, the nap lasted for a couple of hours.

On the morning of the third day, Ye Qingtang opened her eyes slowly. However, her eyes met with a pair of eyes that were so indifferent and cold.

The man with silver hair woke up when she was sleeping. He stared at Ye Qingtang.

“You saved me,” the man said with a cold voice before Ye Qingtang could speak.

“Yes. I saw that you fell from the sky. I was curious and noticed that you were not dead, so…” Ye Qingtang hid the part that she was interested in his space ring naturally.

The man sized up her for a while until she felt nervous from the stare.

“Thank you.”

“You’re welcome… But, you woke up really fast.” Ye Qingtang got up and was still surprised.

His injury was so severe that none of his organs were functioning. However, he only took three days to revive…

“Yes.”

The man answered coldly.

“How did you fall from the sky?” Ye Qingtang asked the question that had bothered her for a few days.

There was a strange luster sparkling from the blood moon as he heard the question.

“If you’re not willing to say, then it’s okay.” Ye Qingtang knew that the question was slightly offensive.

“It’s okay. I was fleeing from murder,” the man said in a monotone.

Ye Qingtang was very sensitive towards the words “flee from murder.” She had fled from murder for three hundred years in her previous life…

Even when she reached the paragon level, there were still countless of people trying to kill her every day. She lived every day in fear, and the feeling… was definitely not pleasant.

“Who… was trying to kill you?” Ye Qingtang probed.

Did the man also offend the super sects in the Formidable Heavens Dynasty?

She observed the man and could not figure out his martial ability. Based on his horrifying body strength, it was difficult for normal sects to kill him. So, maybe it was the super sects.

“Who?” Ye Qingtang was shocked and thought that she heard the name wrong.

“The Ultimate Elder.” The man was expressionless and repeated himself.

“The Ultimate Elder?” Ye Qingtang laughed when she was sure that she heard the name correctly. “The Ultimate Elder had not appeared for many years. No one even knows whether he is dead or alive. How could he chase after you? You think that you are the Blood Moon Sect Lord?”

“Yes,” The man said indifferently.

“Who are you?” Ye Qingtang thought that she heard the wrong thing again.
