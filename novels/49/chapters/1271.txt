Chapter 1272: Let Me Go Free (1)

“Brother, are you looking for me?” Ming Gu walked into Ming Wang’s room and asked.

Ming Wang’s room was dim and ghastly.

“Mhm.” Ming Wang was examining some scrolls at a desk and did not even bat an eye when he responded.

While they were twins, Ming Gu had an inexplicable fear toward Ming Wang.

“You brought the Black Flame Worm over?” Ming Wang asked coldly without looking up.

“Yeah, I brought it over…” Ming Gu looked at Ming Wang and said, “Brother, it’s rare for Ah Yao to be back. She loves the Black Flame Worm the most. If you wish to eat it, I will bring it to you next time…”

“Shut up.” Ming Wang suddenly looked up with a frown as he shot the innocent Ming Gu a cold look.

“It’s been so many years already. Why do you still have so much crap to say? Did I ask you so many things?”

Ming Wang’s voice was so cold that the air could freeze.

Ming Gu trembled and pursed his lips, aggrieved.

It had been so many years, but no matter what he did, his brother was always dissatisfied.

Ming Wang frowned at Ming Gu with a hint of impatience.

“Make preparations for a trip to the Eternal Dynasty two days later,” Ming Wang said coldly.

“I’m not going!” Ming Gu said instinctively.

Ming Wang’s face turned cold immediately.

However, Ming Gu repressed his fear and said, “Ah Yao just returned. I want to stay with her. I am not going to the Eternal Dynasty.”

“Fool…” Ming Wang narrowed his eyes, but he widened it again soon after.

“There are some issues with our cooperation with the Eternal Dynasty. I am occupied with something and can’t leave for the moment. You are not the only one going as the Holy Lord is going too. What else do you have to say?”

Ming Gu’s eyes lit up immediately upon hearing that.

“Ah Yao is going too?”

“I do not wish to repeat the same thing twice,” Ming Wang said coldly.

Ming Gu could not even be bothered with Ming Wang’s cold attitude then. At the thought that he could interact with Ye Qingtang for a long period of time, he agreed immediately. “I’ll go, I’ll go…”

“Get lost then,” Ming Wang said impatiently when he saw Ming Gu’s reaction.

Unconcerned, Ming Gu left in smiles.

He could go on a trip with Ah Yao already~ DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Although Ming Gu left the room, Ming Wang’s furrowed brows never relaxed.

“Lady Ghost.”

A slender figure slowly emerged from the darkness.

“I’m present. Do you have any orders, Holy Son?”

“Bring a few Hall Masters along with Ming Gu two days later. You should be clear of what to do,” Ming Wang looked at Lady Ghost and said.

“I understand.” Lady Ghost smiled and nodded. “The Holy Lord’s identity is still uncertain as of now, and it is inconvenient for us to do anything although we suspect her. The Third Prince of the Eternal Dynasty, Ling Yan, has a demon-like intelligence, and he should be able to tell whether the Holy Lord is real or not.”

Ming Wang nodded in satisfaction.

Lady Ghost said subsequently, “It’s just that… there’s something I don’t understand.”

“Speak,” Ming Wang said.

Lady Ghost said, “Holy Son Ming Gu firmly believes the Holy Lord’s identity and is extremely protective of the Holy Lord right now. Why do you want to bring Holy Son Ming Gu along on this trip?”

Even an idiot could tell that Ming Gu supported Ye Qingtang fully and even had no suspicions of Ye Qingtang’s identity.

Ming Wang sneered. “It’s exactly because Ming Gu firmly believes her that I want Ming Gu to follow them.”

“I am slow-witted.”

Ming Wang said, “You all can clearly see Ming Gu’s attitude, and so can she. If she is an impersonator, she will definitely be on her guard. However, if Ming Gu, who trusts her fully, is beside her, there is a possibility that she will lower her guard.”
