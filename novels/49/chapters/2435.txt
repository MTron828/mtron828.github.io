Chapter 2436: Suspicions (3)

The group had not considered that angle earlier but after the Heaven Dome Academy Vice-President’s comments, they couldn’t help having the same suspicions.

It was undeniable.

The screen had clearly shown the Netherworld Academy Teacher Ye’s death. Faced with an above-Emperor level monster, it was impossible to survive. It would be the same fate for anyone.

Now that Ye Qing had reappeared, how could they explain it?

The minds of the group were hyper-sensitive now. They already suspected the Wailing Well to be a trap and now Ye Qing had been “resurrected”.

“Zhou Tong, what are you trying to imply? Are you suspecting Ye Qing of being one of the masterminds behind the Wailing Well trap?” Wen Qi stood up. The joy of seeing Ye Qing alive again had been dispelled by the Heaven Dome Academy Vice-President’s suspicion. All that was left now was white-hot fury.

Without waiting for the Heaven Dome Academy Vice-President to reply, Wen Qi continued. “I get it now. You are suspecting that our Netherworld Academy is the mastermind behind the Wailing Well affair. This also means that you think the Netherworld Academy is in cahoots with the Universe City people?”

Wen Qi was enraged. “If the Netherworld Academy is the mastermind, will we send our own students in?! Didn’t you see how Luo Sheng died? Or are you blind?!”

Zhou Tong gave a cold laugh. “Wen Qi, why are you so angry? When did I accuse the Netherworld Academy of being the mastermind? I have only mentioned Ye Qing. But I must say that the Netherworld Academy’s losses are the smallest amongst the rest of us, right?”

Everyone fell into deep thought at this. Zhou Tong’s words were not without reason. If they were to make some calculations, the Netherworld Academy had only lost one student and Luo Sheng’s team. Even the Netherworld Academy’s greatest loss, Ye Qing, had now reappeared alive and well…

Wen Qi’s anger deflated.

To be honest, Wen Qi didn’t blame Zhou Tong. If it were him, he would have had the same suspicions.

“I believe in Ye Qing. I can guarantee that he has nothing to do with this affair. Moreover, who here can say that they saw Ye Qing actually die!” Wen Qi stated in a chilly voice.

“Okay, then tell us how did Ye Qing make it out alive? Don’t tell me he is also an above-Emperor level practitioner? He was able to escape from that monster’s fatal attack? His speed was so fast that even we failed to spot it?!” Zhou Tong insisted.

“Space Technique…”

One of the leaders suddenly spoke up. Silence fell across the hall.

Space Technique was a peerless divine technique. Rumor had it that in the entire Second Domain, only that legendary figure had that ability. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Hahahaha!” Zhou Tong guffawed. “The peerless divine Space Technique?! Are you kidding me? Why don’t you just say that Ye Qing is actually that legendary person from the Temple of Paragon?”

Even Wen Qi wouldn’t believe that. Space Technique… there was no way Ye Qing could control space. Wen Qi didn’t even believe that he would know much of the Space Technique. Like Zhou Tong, Wen Qi knew that it was impossible.

“I was just raising a point. If one uses the Space Technique, escape from that monster is possible. I am not claiming that Ye Qing knows the Space Technique.” The academy leader shook his head. He also had no idea why such a ridiculous idea suddenly popped into his head.

Space Technique…
