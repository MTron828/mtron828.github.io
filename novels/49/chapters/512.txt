Chapter 513 Blood Moon Guardian (2)

“WHAT?!”

“Blood Moon Guardian?!” “How can it be!”

In that instant, the Blood Moon members no longer dared to move forward and retreated backward instinctively.

There were a total of three guardians in Blood Moon Sect, and they existed in the sect since a thousand years ago. Their position was only right below the Blood Moon Sect Master and Blood Moon Holy Lord!

Moreover, those three Guardians were personally appointed by the Blood Moon Holy Lord and had never appeared before others ever since the formation of Blood Moon Sect. No one knew of their names nor saw their real faces before…

“You… You said… she is a Blood Moon… Guardian?” For some reason, Blood Demon was unknowingly anxious.

Was this young, beautiful girl really one of the three guardians of Blood Moon Sect?!

“Why? Do you have doubts about my identity?” Ye Qingtang’s expression was as cold as a thousand-year-old glacier.

“This… The Blood Moon Guardians never appeared before anyone… Why…” Blood Demon was bewildered.

“Impudent!” The Blood Moon Elder hollered furiously. “Blood Demon, as a Blood Moon Branch Master, how dare you doubt the Blood Moon Guardian!”

As he spoke, a red gleam erupted from the crescent moon on Ye Qingtang’s glabella.

“The Blood Moon Crescent on her glabella definitely cannot be mentioned on equal terms with that of an Elder’s.” Soul Severing Troll mumbled.

“This Blood Moon Aura… and the crescent on her glabella are indeed possessed only by a Blood Moon Guardian. I can even… feel… the Holy Lord’s remaining aura…”

The blood moon symbol on a Blood Moon Guardian’s glabella was personally bestowed by the Blood Moon Holy Lord and was completely different from that of ordinary elders and members.

After consideration, Blood Demon stared at Ye Qingtang with his mouth agape, and his body trembled slightly.

“Kneel down!”

Ye Qingtang glared furiously, and her manner was utterly different from before. She entered the Paragon level in her previous life, and even if she still had not attained that level now, she could confidently and easily pull off the stance of a powerful figure.

Almost instinctively, Blood Demon and Soul Severing Troll kneeled before Ye Qingtang at once.

“Greetings, Blood Moon Guardian!”

“Greetings, Blood Moon Guardian!”

At the same time, the numerous Blood Moon Sect members kneeled around Ye Qingtang uniformly as though they were trained to.

“I was ignorant and did not recognize you and ended up offending you unintentionally. Please forgive me!” Blood Demon looked down as his body trembled.

What kind of figure was the Blood Moon Guardian! Although a Blood Moon Guardian was not ranked higher than a Blood Moon Sect Master, both were appointed by the Holy Lord.

If Branch Masters like them offended a Guardian… it was a punishable sin!

The Blood Moon Elder looked at the group of Blood Moon members who knelt before Ye Qingtang and then turned to look at Ye Qingtang, who put on an aloof and domineering stance. His lips twitched secretly.

Ye Qingtang did not bother about the Blood Moon Elder’s reaction and merely swept a look across Blood Demon and Soul Severing Troll. “You may rise.”

“Yes!”

Both people responded at the same time and rose slowly. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“I’ve only just resurrected. Let me ask you all, how is the Blood Moon Sect presently?” With hands behind her back, Ye Qingtang had an aloof stance.

“In response to Blood Moon Guardian…”

Soul Severing Troll was about to reply but was pushed aside by Blood Demon.

“Let me say… Guardian, I am clearer than him!” Blood Demon had smiles all over his face.

“You’ll say.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

“Guardian, although Blood Moon Sect had been annihilated for a thousand years, the Holy Lord has bestowed the Blood Moon Aura to all high-ranking members. A thousand years later, those Elders, Division Heads, and even the Sect Master will gradually come back to life…”
