Chapter 240: Dare to touch her? (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

An extremely cold voice suddenly knocked onto her heart.

This voice… is so familiar.

Ye Qingtang was slightly astonished.

This voice obviously belonged to the person whom Mu Su brought her to meet that day.

Watching the evil spirit retreating away cowardly, Ye Qingtang felt a complicated and indescribable feeling.

“That evil spirit wanted to suck my mother’s blood and essence just now. Would-be… uh… You must not let it off!” Upon seeing the familiar back view, the little dragon man was suddenly energetic as it jumped out to lodge a complaint without caring about the crack on its face.

A murderous air surrounded the tall man instantly, and the evil spirit suddenly felt an overpowering force directed towards him.

He clearly did not move at all, but an overpowering force was instantaneously emitted from the man.

All of a sudden, an invisible airstream rammed against the evil spirit’s chest!

In that instant, a hole was penetrated in the evil spirit’s chest, and before it could even let out a cry, it fell on the ground.

Such a powerful evil spirit was, however, killed by that man without effort… 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

After witnessing everything, Ye Qingtang was alarmed as she was even more certain of her guess on the man’s identity.

In the whole world, who else could possess such unbelievably-godly powers other than that person from the Antiquity Palace?

The evil spirit was already dead, but Ye Qingtang could not feel any better. How she wished she could stuff the little dragon man in her arms and cover its mouth which brought trouble.

Oh, my little brat!

This was not someone you can order around freely but someone who your mother, I, needed to avoid!

Ye Qingtang saw the lifeless evil spirit on the floor, and her heart quivered. She instinctively touched her chest, deeply afraid that the man would beat her to a pulp once he turned around and realized she had the Heart of the Demon God hidden in her body…

However…

The more she feared, the more her fears became true. When Ye Qingtang was filled with worries, the man suddenly turned around and looked at her.

Under the moonlight, his exquisitely handsome appearance fell into Ye Qingtang’s eyes. On his cold face laid a set of eyes so deep that one could drown in it.

Ye Qingtang was stunned. Previously, she only heard the person’s voice and never thought that… such an unrivaled, handsome face was hidden behind that layer of curtains.

In both lives, Ye Qingtang self-professed that she had seen many pretty boys, but none of them could be compared to this person before her.

How could there be a man so good-looking?

Ye Qingtang was actually a little dumbfounded at the moment.

Han Cangming looked at the young girl who blanked out as his deep eyes reflected her beautiful face.

At that very instant, the little dragon man could not be bothered with its injuries. Just from watching its mother and would-be father making eye contact, it wagged its tail agitatedly.

Would-be father!

You’re too amazing!

No one can beat you at saving a damsel in distress!

Quick!

Give mother an affectionate hug!

Kiss her!

Kiss her now!

Carry her home!

Make a baby with her!

The little dragon man was so excited that its tail wagged continuously and excited tiny stars dotted his widened eyes.

Perhaps it was because the little dragon man’s reaction was too extreme, Ye Qingtang returned to her senses and immediately took a step back after recalling the person’s identity and considering the Heart of the Demon God in her body.
