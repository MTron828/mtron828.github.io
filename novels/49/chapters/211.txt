On the journey, Zhou Xuan made things difficult for Ye Qingtang both covertly and overtly but never really attacked her. He merely used words to lead the two disciples who were dissatisfied with Ye Qingtang’s spirit root to give Ye Qingtang some attitude, although she completely ignored their sarcastic and discriminating gazes.

Very obviously, Zhou Xuan did not plan to attack Ye Qingtang on the road.

Although they left Xuanling Sect, killing off a fellow disciple would require a safe and sound opportunity. Zhou Xuan was not willing to let others have something on him. Thus... his target had been locked on the Spirit Condensation Mountain Village from the very start.

There was the main field for him to deal with Ye Qingtang.

After an arduous journey, the five people finally reached Spirit Condensation Mountain Village.

Plants were flattened on a tall mountain, and there were houses situated from the foot of the mountain all the way to the peak. This entire mountain was under Spirit Condensation Mountain Village’s possession, and everyone who resided there was a part of forces affiliated to Spirit Condensation Mountain Village. With one look, one could see that there were hundreds of families living there. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Ye Qingtang and the rest had just reached the foot of the mountain, but their Xuanling Sect uniform attracted the attention of the people nearby the mountain village. In no time, an old man and a handsome young man approached them quickly.

“Sorry for not coming ahead to welcome you as we were unaware of your arrival. Do pardon us!” That elderly lifted his clothes and knelt before the five teenagers on horses without caring about seniority.

The young man beside the elderly immediately followed the elderly and knelt with his head hung low as well.

Similarly, the surrounding citizens knelt down earnestly in awe and respect on both sides of the Xuanling Sect disciples.

The reverence of a sect was simply not what a normal person could offend. In the eyes of ordinary citizens, those who entered a sect were mighty figures standing on top of the clouds—holy and could not be infringed.

Zhou Xuan and the rest had been in the sect for a long time and were already used to such a grand greeting. This was how noble a sect disciple was in the eyes of normal people.

Moreover, Spirit Condensation Mountain Village was originally reliant on Xuanling Sect, and, thus, the people were even more reverent towards them.

“Rise. We are ordered here to investigate the tragedy in Spirit Condensation Mountain Village. Which of you is the current person in charge?” Zhou Xuan, who was sitting on a horse, glanced across the group of people before him.

That old man slowly rose and stepped forward. “I was originally the Apothecary of Spirit Condensation Mountain Village and am considered the person in charge of this place right now. This is...” He raised his hand and pointed to the silent young man beside him.

“This is the adopted stepson of the Village Master, Wu Zheng. We have been waiting for you all for a long time. Please do us, Spirit Condensation Mountain Village, justice.”

“Of course.” Zhou Xuan replied proudly.

“You all must be worn out from the journey. We have already prepared food and drinks. You all can dismount and rest for a while while understanding the situation here,” The Apothecary said respectfully.

Zhou Xuan nodded slightly. After exchanging a look with the other disciples, he immediately dismounted and headed to their destination with the company of the Apothecary and Wu Zheng.

Ye Qingtang walked beside Lin Long at the tail of the team and looked at the surrounding citizen’s faces casually.

Perhaps it was because a bloody massacre happened, fear and uneasiness were prevalent in the citizens’ eyes, though they faked a calm front. Only after they saw Ye Qingtang and the others did that look of uneasiness fade away slowly, though their ash-pale faces were enough to prove the trepidation they felt over the past few days.
