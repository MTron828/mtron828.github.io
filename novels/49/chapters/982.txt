Chapter 983 Death Wish (4)

Duan Yangjing looked as if he wanted to eat them alive.

“Duan Yangjing, what do you mean?” Ye Ling spoke carefully. In the past, their Ye Family would certainly not be afraid of an attack from the Duan Family.

But in the past year, it was not just the younger members of the Duan Family who had rapidly improved in terms of ability with the help of the Long Family. Even the elders and Duan Yangjing had also improved rapidly.

Approximately a year ago, Duan Yangjing’s ability had been comparable to that of Second Elder. But now, he had broken through to the peak of the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level One and was a mere step away from Martial Qi Level Two.

Even the elders of the Duan Family had all achieved the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level One.

The Ye Family currently could not counteract this kind of fighting strength.

“What do I mean? Ye Ling, hand your daughter over!” Duan Yangjing said coldly.

“What?” Ye Ling was startled. His daughter?

“Are you still acting dumb? If you don’t hand Ye Qingtang over to me today, our Duan Family will slaughter your entire Ye Family!” threatened Duan Yangjing.

“Duan Yangjing, my daughter just returned to Lin Town yesterday. She doesn’t know anything. Why make things difficult for her? If you have any grievances, you can come after me.” Ye Ling would not budge an inch in matters concerning Ye Qingtang.

He did not understand what the matter was with Duan Yangjing to make the latter aggressively demand him to hand over his daughter.

“Don’t know anything? Ye Ling, don’t treat me like a fool! Today, your daughter, Ye Qingtang, severely injured my son Tianyun in the martial arts arena. If you don’t hand Ye Qingtang over today, you won’t be allowed to leave the Ye House at all!!” Duan Yangjing roared.

The three elders of the Ye Family and Ye Ling were all stunned by Duan Yangjing’s words.

“Wh… What?” Ye Ling thought he must have heard wrong. Otherwise, it must Duan Yangjing who had gone crazy.

Tang Tang had severely injured Duan Tianyun?

What kind of joke was this?

“Duan Tianyun, you’re the villain here. Don’t you dare make the first complaint! It was Duan Tianyun from the Duan Family who severely wounded my grandson, Dan Yifan. My grandson is now still lying unconscious on the sickbed, but you’re here to shift the blame instead!” The Great Elder went forward and berated them.

What kind of ability did Ye Qingtang have?

She was merely a red spirit root and had just entered the Xuanling Sect a year ago. How could she possibly have the ability to severely injure Duan Tianyun, who had attained the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level One?!

The Duan Family was clearly maligning her!

Duan Yangjing casually pointed to Duan Tianrao and Duan Tianrui, who were standing nearby.

“Tell the Ye Family what you saw at the martial arts arena.”

Duan Tianrui immediately said, “I saw Ye Qingtang injure my older brother with my own eyes. My older brother had beaten Dan Yifan, but Ye Qingtang suddenly and unexpectedly challenged my older brother. She fought viciously and severely injured my older brother.”

“It’s not just me. Even those members of your Ye Family who were present would have witnessed it too.” Duan Tianrui pointed at the youths from the Ye Family, who were standing in the front yard.

“What happened?” Ye Ling frowned slightly and looked at the youths. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

These youths had been frightened out of their wits by the conclusion of the match and had forgotten to report to the Master. Now that they were publicly questioned, they recounted how Ye Qingtang had beaten Duan Tianyun.

The expressions of Ye Ling and the three elders grew increasingly bemused as the youths spoke.

They thought they had lost the match.

Had the Ye Family actually won?
