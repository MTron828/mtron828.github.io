Chapter 547: Blood Moon Holy Lord (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The two super sects, Yuehua Sect and Lingyun Sect, were present currently, and this group of Blood Moon Sect forces would definitely be wiped out. Thus, there was no longer any fear of facing Blood Moon Sect.

Looking at that silver-haired man, if he was not a Blood Moon Division Head, he should be a Blood Moon Elder.

But even if he was a Blood Moon Elder, his death was definite!

However, the silver-haired man did not react after a long while.

“Roar!”

The Yunxiao Sect divine beast roared in fury as it glared at the silver-haired man with its lantern-like eyes.

“Don’t…” Li Chenfeng muttered.

Li Chenfeng was alarmed.

Others might not know the identity of this silver-haired man, but Li Chenfeng did.

A thousand years had passed, and those who saw the Blood Moon Holy Lord in the battle had already passed on.

However, Li Chenfeng saw a portrait of the Blood Moon Sect’s Holy Lord by chance once, and the person on that portrait was exactly this silver-haired man before their eyes!

As he looked at the bright red blood moon on that man’s glabella, Li Chenfeng was even more sure of the other party’s identity.

However…

A thousand years ago, hundreds of sects combined forces in an attempt to annihilate the Blood Moon Sect

At the last moment, the Blood Moon Holy Lord appeared and slaughtered dozens of extremely powerful demonic beasts, with one of them being the mother of Yunxiao Sect’s sect protector divine beast.

The Blood Moon Holy Lord had killed the divine beast’s mother a thousand years ago, and rage flooded the beast’s eyes as it saw the Blood Moon Holy Lord today.

The divine beast was long drowned in hatred currently and could not be controlled by Li Chenfeng. No matter how Li Chenfeng dissuaded it, there was no use.

“Roar!”

The divine beast let out an enraged roar once again, and its gigantic body charged towards the Blood Moon Holy Lord.

In an instant, it was as though dark clouds covered the sky as a wild gust of wind stirred. Yunxiao Sect’s divine beast was extremely skilled and could be said to be unrivaled. The moment it struck, its demonic air swept throughout the place.

Everyone only saw that, for some unknown reason, the Yunxiao Sect divine beast was out of control and charged towards that silver-haired man.

Upon noticing the situation, the Blood Moon Division Head and others had a rude awakening and dashed forward quickly, wanting to stop the Yunxiao Sect divine beast.

Yet, the divine beast that was out of control was frighteningly powerful. With the sweep of a tail, the Blood Moon Sect forces were forced to retreat.

The Xuanling Sect masses below were astonished. The sudden change caught everyone unexpected, and no one had the time to examine the reason behind the Yunxiao Sect divine beast’s behavior after seeing the silver-haired man.

Right now, the Xuanling Sect masses were only worried about Ye Qingtang. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Ye Qingtang was standing right in front of the silver-haired man. With the Yunxiao Sect divine beast attacking the silver-haired man, they were afraid that Ye Qingtang would experience an undeserved catastrophe as well.

“Be careful!”

A pair of wings grew behind Ye Qingtang’s back, and she immediately grabbed the Blood Moon Holy Lord’s arm, wanting to bring him away from here.

However, the Blood Moon Holy Lord remained rooted to the same spot, seeming to not have any plan to escape.

Swoosh!

In the next second, the Blood Moon Holy Lord took a step out and pulled Ye Qingtang behind him.

“You…”

Ye Qingtang was astonished. That was Yunxiao Sect’s sect protector divine beast!

A cold sneer could be seen on the faces of the Fengyue Sect and Lingyun Sect masses. They had not seen this silver-haired man before, but from his appearance, they reckoned that he should be a Blood Moon Sect Elder. If he was at his peak, perhaps he still could have a match with the Yunxiao Sect divine beast. However, most of the Blood Moon Sect masses had just resurrected not long ago, and their skills naturally could not be compared to when they were at their peak. Thus, he was definitely not the Yunxiao Sect divine beast’s opponent.
