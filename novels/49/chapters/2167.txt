Chapter 2168: Ten Moves (3)

Lei Yan was both delighted and sad upon hearing that Ye Qing would be giving him some special training. And yet, Ye Qing’s premise for giving this special training was that Lei Yan had to endure a beating at the end!

This was all too overwhelming.

Even if Teacher Ye was a god descended from heaven, he could not possibly make Lei Yan strong enough within ten days to fight against the Eight Heaven level Qin Feng...

Lei Yan felt that Ye Qing was really reaching for the stars this time. But since he got the opportunity to undergo special training, at most... he would just have to endure another beating by Qin Feng in ten days.

It could be said that Lei Yan was carrying a do-or-die attitude.

Of course, he couldn’t help linking this to the first time he met Ye Qing, if he had done anything overly offensive such that the teacher was using this opportunity to take revenge.

Meanwhile, Yun Chen remained silent at the side. Ye Qingtang was not anxious about that. She knew that Yun Chen’s line of thinking was similar to Qin Feng’s and She was also in no hurry to prove herself today. She would let Yun Chen come and observe the fight in ten days. He could decide whether to stay on then.

Yun Chen could not figure out this new teacher. He didn’t say anything much but left after politely bidding her farewell.

Ye Qingtang called Nangong Lie and Lei Yan over and asked them about their past cultivation methods. She then offered them specific advice on how to improve.

The two of them weren’t too invested at first. But the more Ye Qing explained, the more engrossed they became.

It was especially the case for Lei Yan. Ye Qing completely debunked all his past cultivation methods, and then offered him a brand new way to cultivate. His eyes nearly popped out in amazement as he listened.

These were all novel changes to martial art techniques which they had never heard before!

“Lei Yan, you started learning martial arts too late, so some techniques are no longer suitable for you. You need to forget every foundational technique you learned while you were with your family clan. Start afresh.” Ye Qingtang was completely flabbergasted by the Leiting family’s methods after understanding Lei Yan’s situation.

The Leiting family was not wrong in arranging for Lei Yan to learn those foundational techniques. But it was just that Lei Yan was already too old for it.

Lei Yan had been in his teens when he first officially started martial arts. Yet, he was practicing techniques made for children aged four to five. It should be pointed out that the physical body of a teen was way more developed than that of a five year old child.

Practicing those foundational techniques had been just a waste of time.

Outsiders believed that Lei Yan was lacking in innate talent. But Ye Qingtang was of another view.

Lei Yan’s innate talents were pretty good but he lacked a suitable mentor. He ended up going in one big circle, such that he was only at the Paragon Sixth Heaven level now. With his innate talent, he should be capable of more. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Ye Qingtang told Lei Yan about the techniques that were more suited for his cultivation situation. These were techniques that had been improved over a period of 300 years into the future.

“Ah, yes...” Lei Yan was listening attentively. He kept nodding,desperately wishing that he had a notebook to record every single word that Ye Qing was saying.

Who said that their teacher was a useless fool? He would kill them all! Even he could tell that Ye Qing’s understanding of martial arts was to be treasured!

It was like he had struck a windfall!

Jing Ze stirred. His body felt like it was suffused with a strange yet familiar aura. His last memories were of the practice arena, but when he looked around him, he realized that he was back in the classroom.

And two additional figures, who weren’t supposed to be here, were also inside the classroom.

“Lei Yan? Nangong Lie?” Jing Ze was stunned. What was going on?

He had been unconscious for just a short period of time. Why were these two fiends here now?
