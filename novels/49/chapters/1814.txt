Chapter 1815: Betrayal (2)

Even as the lightning penetrated his shoulder, the Heavenly Demon didn’t move a step but just gritted its teeth and looked up at the woman who had flown up to mid-air.

“Shining God! I already agreed to leave with you. How can you break your promise like that!” The woman’s face turned grim as holy light radiated out of her body.

The Shining God replied, but Ye Qingtang didn’t know what he was saying. Even so, Ye Qingtang could see the woman calming down at his words.

The Shining God didn’t linger on but just left with the woman. Ye Qingtang was also pulled along with the woman back to the temple.

“Shining God, I promise you that I won’t go meet him again. You said that the bolt of lightning was a warning to him. Then let me also give you a warning. If you dare to attack him, you will become my enemy.” The woman stood in the temple and stared at the Shining God with cold eyes.

The Heavenly Demons’ abilities were greatly curbed inside the mystic realm. And this temple was the energy source that powered that restriction. This was also the reason why the True Gods were able to imprison the Heavenly Demons in here.

The woman was willing to comply because she knew that the Shining God could easily kill the Heavenly Demon if he wished to do so. Try as she might, there was nothing she could do to stop him.

The Shining God said something.

The woman frowned. “I already told you that he is different from the other Heavenly Demons! I believe in him. It is pure love between the two of us. There is no way he is just making use of me!

“In this whole world, anyone may be capable of betrayal. However, he is the only exception. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“I trust him. If he really commits any crime in future, I will bear all consequences!”

The Shining God clearly had no wish to continue arguing with the woman, and he waved her away in the end. The woman took a deep breath and returned to the inner region of the temple.

As the woman left, the illusion once again changed.

A large group of primordial humans were standing inside the temple. Meanwhile, on the altar, the usually stern-faced Shining God looked pallid.

There was a gold wine goblet by his seat.

The holy light that he usually exuded was clearly weaker now.

The leaders of the primordial humans eyed the pale-looking Shining God with cold eyes. They no longer gazed at him with respect and awe. Instead, their eyes were filled with ambition and desire.

The powers of those primordial humans were far greater than any human that Ye Qingtang had ever met. Their powers were nearly on par to that of the True God.

Just a little more, and they could possess enough power to rise above the True Gods.

“The True Gods have lorded over us for tens of thousands of years. You created us but put so many restrictions upon us. We will no longer be puppets under your control...” The leader of the primordial humans suddenly spoke up. This time, Ye Qingtang could actually hear his voice.

But she only heard that one sentence. She couldn’t hear the rest of what he was saying.

At this point, Ye Qingtang realized that she was witnessing the very moment that the primordial humans allied with the Heavenly Demons to betray the True Gods!

There must be some harmful substance inside that wine goblet!

Incapacitated, the Shining God’s face was very grim. He suddenly raised one hand and a holy light engulfed the whole temple. A group of holy temple guards suddenly appeared and charged toward those traitorous humans.

Like that, a bloody battle was triggered in that temple, a battle of the legends.

At this moment, Ye Qingtang found out just how powerful those primordial humans were!
