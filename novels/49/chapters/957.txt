Chapter 958 Ye Family (2)

“That’s good.” Ye Ling nodded his head in relief.

Ye Qingtang could smell the faint smell of medicine. She followed the smell and looked towards the study table in front of Ye Ling.

A bowl of brown medicine was sitting on the study table.

“Has Father been ill recently? Why are you drinking medicine?”

Before she left the Ye house, Ye Qingtang had neutralized the slow-acting poison which the Ye Family’s Great Elder had used to poison Ye Ling. She had also given him a few prescriptions to improve his health before she left.

Ye Ling only needed to follow the prescriptions for half a year to recover all the ground he had lost.

Why was he still eating medicine now?

A strange look flashed across Ye Ling’s face, but he laughed and said, “It’s nothing serious.” He raised his hand and pushed the bowl of medicine away from Ye Qingtang.

Before Ye Qingtang could continue, Ye Ling changed the subject and said, “Although it’s good to miss home, you have only just entered the Xuanling Sect. Don’t be too casual. The sect has many rules. You had better not spend too long outside it.”

“I’ve just come back, and now, Father wants to drive me away?” Ye Qingtang was sharp enough to read between the lines of her father’s words. It was clear that her father did not want her to stay with them for too long.

“This is your home, who could drive you away? I am merely afraid that the sect will blame you. After, it was not easy to enter the Xuanling Sect. You are now a disciple of the Xuanling Sect and must naturally make good use of this opportunity,” Ye Ling said as he sighed softly.

Just as Ye Ling finished speaking, a knocking was heard from the study door.

“Master, Second Elder, the Great Elder is inviting you over for a discussion.” A voice could be heard from beyond the door.

“The Great Elder?” Ye Qingtang was slightly taken aback when she heard this.

If she remembered correctly, the Great Elder had died long ago.

Second Elder said, “Tang Tang, many changes have taken place in the Ye Family since you left. The Great Elder of the Ye Family is no longer Ye You’s grandfather but someone your father and I invited.”

With that, Second Elder rose and said, “I’ll go first. You and your father have not seen each other for a long time. There is no need to rush over.”

“You go and take a look first. I’ll follow in a while,” Ye Ling said.

With that, Second Elder left the study.

“Father, the Great Elder was invited by you and Second Uncle?” Ye Qingtang looked at Ye Ling. When she had first reached the Ye house, she had realized that many unfamiliar faces had appeared in the Ye house.

Ye Ling nodded slightly and said, “That’s right, we invited him.”

Ye Ling immediately said, “In the past, Ye You’s grandfather was very ambitious and tried to control the Ye family. After you got rid of him, your Second Uncle and I also took the opportunity to cleanse the Ye Family of his followers…”

The Ye Family had been in a precarious state. The death of Ye You’s grandfather had rid the Ye Family of latent danger. However, it had also been a major setback, and many of its elite members were driven from the Ye Family, causing a great loss of the Ye Family’s power.

After a long discussion between Ye Ling and Second Elder on how to restore the Ye Family, Second Elder had invited two powerful people to settle in the Ye Family and take up the position of Elder within the Ye Family.

The current new Great Elder was one of the powerful men who had been invited. The other received the honorific of Third Elder. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Besides entering the Ye Family, these two new elders also brought their offspring and disciples into the Ye Family. Their entry had slowly caused the Ye Family’s decline.
