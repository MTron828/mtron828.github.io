Many ancient clans remained in hiding throughout the Central Mainland. There was no great hurry for them to go into battle with the Temple of Shadows at this point.

“Tell the Sacred Ground of Reflection not to let the Temple of Shadows rest easy. After we finish off the remaining powers in Central Mainland, we will go and deal with the Temple of Shadows,” the elder instructed.

The warden hesitated a moment before nodding in compliance.

“Understood. I will immediately contact the Sacred Ground of Reflection. They now belong to the Ancient You Clan and will naturally do their best for us. Otherwise, we have no reason to keep them around.”

The Sacred Ground of Reflection managed to avoid destruction as they did not have any Spirit of Chaos fragments. But they were also very astute and knew it was in their best interests to submit to the Ancient You Clan. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

With a curt nod, the elder turned and left without another word.

...

Meanwhile, Ye Qingtang and her group left the Ancient You Clan’s territory and soon arrived back at the Temple of Shadows.

Most of the ancient clan folks could not understand why Ye Qingtang chose to suddenly retreat.

“Are you all fools? Didn’t you see the Ancient You Clan leading a huge group of people over? If the Holy Lord had not wisely chosen to retreat, do you think you all would have escaped with your lives?” Ming Di snorted.

The crowd was shocked. Having stood some distance away, they could not see what was happening within the canyon. Even the thought alone made them break out in cold sweat.

The Ancient You Clan was probably leading a group of youths who were all as diabolically powerful as the earlier ones.

There was no need for Ming Di and the Holy Lord of Shadows to fear them, but the rest of ancient clan folks would likely all perish there.

By then, Ming Di would be held up by that little monster, while the youths could split up with one group to distract Ye Qingtang and the other group to destroy the rest of them.

At this point, the crowd couldn’t help feeling that Ye Qingtang was indeed wise and had helped save all their lives.

Little did they know that...

Ye Qingtang was also trying to save her own life...

Ming Di was the only one of them able to fight back. With the dragon being kept busy by Little Luo Xue, the rest of them would definitely have died by the time the main Ancient You Clan group arrived.

“Ming Di, since you were able to see it, how many people did the Ancient You Clan have on their side?” One of the ancient clan leaders asked.

“Too many to count. Several hundred at least.”

Several hundreds... of those monsters?!

The ancient clan folks gasped.

“This is only one of the Ancient You Clan’s strongholds. Who knows how many more people they have in other places,” the Demon Tribe Leader pointed out.

His words were the final straw that broke the camel’s back. Everyone instantly felt hopelessly deflated.

One youth was enough to destroy multiple ancient clans. Let alone hundreds and thousands of them...

Destroying the entire mainland would be a breeze.

At that moment, everyone fell into the depths of despondency. They could not comprehend just how powerful their opponent was.

No wonder...

It was no wonder the Ancient You Clan behaved so arrogantly.

“Holy Lord, we have no choice but to rely on the Temple of Shadows now. Please protect us!” One of the ancient clan leaders immediately fell to his knees before Ye Qingtang. Right in front of everyone, he took out his Spirit of Chaos fragment and offered it to Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang, “...”

“I know I am no match for the Ancient You Clan. Even if I were to hang on to this Spirit of Chaos fragment, it would just be a matter of time before the Ancient You Clan took it from me. Holy Lord, please protect us. I am willing to offer this fragment to you if you will protect my clan,” the leader stated in a hoarse voice.
