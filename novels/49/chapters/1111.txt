Chapter 1112 A Single Spark Can Start A Prairie Fire (2)

On the other hand, the martial realms of the powerful figures in the Central Mainland were much higher than those of the people here from the start.

You Ancient Clan was widely known even in the Central Mainland. They had a massive force and countless Yin Yang Perfected Lords. Those sects had never seen such a battle array before, and the sects at the northern mainland had completely fallen to You Ancient Clan without having You Ancient Clan to do anything.

In the next half a month, the northern region of the mainland had completely fallen, and hundreds of sects and family clans became the cannon fodder for the You Ancient Clan.

Black and White Holy Son chuckled in the main hall of Falling Sky Valley. “This is indeed a common practice of the You Ancient Clan. They could annihilate this mainland and cause an internal war without losing a single one of their soldiers…”

Perfected Xuanchen nodded. Following powerful figures was an inherent mindset of humans, and whether they would kill each other was not something they could consider anymore.

Ye Qingtang originally thought that after You Ancient Clan came to this mainland, they would come straight for Falling Sky Valley and capture Little You Yun away. However, it now seemed that she had underestimated the You Ancient Clan.

“Haha… Why are you worried, Miss Ye? You just need to kill up north.” A chuckle suddenly echoed around.

Everyone was confused by the voice and looked around their surroundings. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Who spoke?” Yin Yang Child asked with a frown.

However, no one responded.

When that familiar voice entered her ears, a strange look emerged in Ye Qingtang’s eyes silently.

Others might not be able to tell, but the voice of this person…

“This voice… Why do I feel that it’s so familiar…” Yin Yang Child suddenly looked at Ye Qingtang, and his expression changed in no time. “Ling… Ling Yan?!”

Upon mentioning Ling Yan, Yin Yang Child looked around his surroundings almost instinctively but failed to see any trace of Ling Yan.

Ye Qingtang also looked around but did not catch any sight of him. Then, she recalled that the source of the sound seemed to be near her, and she remembered that she had a voice transmission stone on her.

Ye Qingtang immediately took out her voice transmission stone.

Previously, when Ye Qingtang and Ling Yan were in the Dragon Vein, they relied on the voice transmission stone to communicate. She never expected Ling Yan’s voice to ring from the voice transmission stone again.

Upon seeing the voice transmission stone, Absolute Monarch of Heaven, Black and White Holy Son, and the rest suddenly realized the situation.

No wonder they could not find the owner of that voice after looking everywhere. “Who is Ling Yan?” A Central Mainland powerful figure asked curiously. The Central Mainland was extremely vast. It had millions of small nations, hundreds of big nations, and even several big dynasties.

It was normal for the talented powerful figures to not know of each other or to even not have heard the names of other powerful figures.

“Humph. Don’t you know Ling Yan? A prince of Eternal Dynasty and a good-for-nothing with no martial skills.” Yin Yang Child snorted coldly. Perhaps because he was tricked by Ling Yan before, Yin Yin Yang Child was full of hatred when he talked about Ling Yan.

“Yin Yang Child, you have a grudge against that Ling Yan?” The man in black armor sharply sensed Yin Yang Child’s strange tone and laughed immediately.

“Of course!” Yin Yang Child did not deny.

“You said Ling Yan is a good-for-nothing. If he is a good-for-nothing and you have a grudge against him, why don’t you kill him? Given your skills, it should be an easy feat to kill a good-for-nothing, isn’t it?” The man in black armor said.

Yin Yang Child’s expression changed immediately, and he glared at the man in black armor fiercely.
