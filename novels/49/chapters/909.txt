Chapter 910 Demon-Like Intelligence (3)

Ling Yan’s hair swayed gently as he looked down with a faint smile without saying anything

“However, Ling Yan, that Grand Elder should have seen Ye Qingtang’s face… Will your plan really work?” The little azure dragon was rather confused again.

“To kill Perfected Gu Yun with one strike and still be alive after a Venerate appeared, what do you think such a person’s martial realm should be?” Ling Yan asked.

“At least a Heavenly Venerate.” The little azure dragon replied.

“What about Miss Ye?” Ling Yan asked.

“Ye Qingtang? Just an ordinary Yin Yang Perfected Lord…” The little azure dragon answered honestly.

The moment the little azure dragon spoke, a flash of light ran in his head instantly!

It looked at Ling Yan with newfound realization and exclaimed.

“I understand now! The Divine Virtual Academy students would insist that it’s not that they did not protect the Feng clan noble but that the incomer was a Heavenly Venerate. Since that’s the case, how could an ordinary Yin Yang Perfected Lord kill a Feng clan noble, who had the protection of many powerful Divine Virtual Academy disciples? Thus, even if Ye Qingtang’s luck was extremely bad and she is found by the Grand Elder of the Feng clan, he would not believe that his grandson was killed by her. Instead, he would feel that someone intentionally disguised into her appearance and wanted to push the blame to Ye Qingtang…”

Ye Qingtang’s true skills happened to be able to confuse the Grand Elder’s judgments! Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Everyone would insist that a Heavenly Venerate killed Feng Wuya. Thus, in the eyes of the Grand Elder, Ye Qingtang, a Yin Yang Perfected Lord, would definitely not be the murderer!

Even if the Grand Elder of the Feng clan saw Ye Qingtang’s face previously, he definitely would not believe that she was the one who did it.

After all…

The martial realms did not match at all!

How could a young girl at the Yin Yang Perfected Lord realm kill Feng Wuya, who was protected by the Divine Virtual Academy disciples?

Furthermore…

The Feng clan had always been suspicious and would naturally over-complicate Feng Wuya’s murder.

Fraudulence, disguising of identity… The Feng clan would probably have such speculations…

The little azure dragon looked at Ling Yan in shock. This person was truly meticulous in his actions, and there was no flaw to be spoken of. Every step in his scheme was a dead end with no way out for others…

“Ling Yan, if I guessed correctly, you want the Feng clan to attack the Jiang family not for yourself… There’s completely no need for you to provoke the Jiang family. You must have done so for Ye Qingtang.” The little azure dragon looked at Ling Yan meaningfully.

The Jiang family and Ling Yan did not have many relations, and Ling Yan did not need to deal with the Jiang family at all.

Rather…

Ye You and Ye Qingtang were mortal enemies, but Ye You became the granddaughter of the Domain Master, Jiang Duantian. As such, if Ye Qingtang headed to the Central Mainland, she would be in critical danger anytime…

The little azure dragon could ascertain that the true reason Ling Yan schemed against the Jiang family and drew such a huge enemy to the Feng clan was to protect Ye Qingtang…

“Miss Ye, you say…” An unnamed coldness emerged in Ling Yan’s eyes. “I will let anyone who has evil designs on Miss Ye have a taste of extreme misery like that of in hell.”

“Tsk tsk… Are you still the Ling Yan I know?” After hearing what Ling Yan said, the little azure dragon looked at him with an ambiguous expression.

“If that’s the case, you can get to know me again.” The icy expression in his eyes faded away, and he resumed his usual faint smile on his face.
