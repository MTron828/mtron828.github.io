“What do you wish to look at?” The warden asked with a rare smile.

Ye Qingtang was slightly surprised but replied quickly. “I wish to find a weapon that I like.”

The warden scanned through the weapons displayed of which each had labels indicating the price of over a hundred Xuanming points. “Is there anything you like from here?”

Ye Qingtang shook her head.

A smile emerged in the warden’s eyes as he opened the cabinet at the back. The moment the cabinet was opened, the glistening weapons caught the eyes of many disciples, and everyone stretched their necks over, wanting to find out what exactly was happening.

It should be known that there was nothing special about the items on display in the Xuanming Pavilion. The real treasures were carefully kept away by the warden, and one would not even have a chance to see it if their Xuanming points were insufficient.

The warden took out a sword from the cabinet and placed it in front of Ye Qingtang.

“What do you think of this sword?” The warden asked with a smile. He knew that Ye Qingtang obtained fifty thousand Xuanming points as a reward and thus took out treasures to recommend generously.

Ye Qingtang saw a huge dragon carved on the golden scabbard of the sword. Her eyes twinkled. The sword had not been removed from its scabbard, but it already took her breath away. Clearly, it was of a totally different level from the weapons displayed outside.

The warden saw the awestruck expression in Ye Qingtang’s eyes and immediately drew the sword out.

The moment the sword was removed from its scabbard, a dragon roar was heard, and a light suddenly blinded everyone’s eyes.

“This sword is called the Dragon Spring Sword. It is made using first-class cold iron.” The warden drew a few strokes using the sword, and although he waved the sword casually, the flashes and shadows of the sword blurred everyone’s vision.

“Not bad,” Ye Qingtang said to the point.

The warden flashed a smile and then kept the sword back into its scabbard.

“This is nothing. There are even better ones.” Then, the warden turned around and took out another sword from the cabinet. The sword was just placed before Ye Qingtang, but she already felt a warm air surging towards her. There was an image of a flame engraved on the scabbard, and it was as though the sword was wrapped in a ball of flame.

Ye Qingtang eyes brightened.

The warden said, “Usually, disciples are not allowed to touch these swords. But… I’ll make an exception today. You can try it out.” Afterward, he pushed the sword towards Ye Qingtang.

The surrounding disciples gathered around her instinctively. The consecutive treasure swords being taken out had already attracted everyone’s attention, and their eyes were glued on when they saw the scarlet sword. How could they be bothered about anything else anymore?

Ye Qingtang held the sword. The moment the sword was in her hands, she felt a warm sensation in her palms. A confused expression flashed across her eyes as she drew the sword out of its scabbard.

In an instant, it was as if a ball of flames surged out from the scabbard. The scarlet sword in Ye Qingtang’s hand had a faint red glimmer around the entire sword!

“Blazing Flame Sword! Is that the Blazing Flame Sword?! Am I seeing things?!” A disciple could not help but gasp when he saw the red glimmer on the sword.

“You can’t be talking about the Blazing Flame Sword that the Fire Monarch used back then, right?”

“Apart from that sword, what else can it be? Back then, the Fire Monarch used this Blazing Flame Sword to exterminate all the traitors. I did not expect that… this Blazing Flame Sword was actually in our sect.”
