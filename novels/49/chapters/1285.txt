Chapter 1286: The Eternal Dynasty (3)

Ming Gu could not be bothered to make small talk with these two. His gaze remained fixed on Ye Qingtang.

When they saw that Ming Gu was ignoring them, the two of them naturally did not say anything else.

“And this is…” The Eldest Prince’s keen senses noted the direction of Ming Gu’s gaze and noticed a beautiful young girl with a faint smile, who was sitting nearby.

Lady Ghost’s expression flickered, and she said, “This is Elder Ye from the Temple of Shadows.”

“So you’re an elder. Greetings, Elder!” The Eldest Prince and Princess did not suspect anything and simply bowed.

Before Ye Qingtang entered the Eternal Dynasty, she had instructed Lady Ghost not to tell anyone that she was the Holy Lord. Lady Ghost had naturally followed her orders.

“We have received the Eldest Prince’s news. What is the situation now?” Lady Ghost said with a smile.

Now that Ye Qingtang was incognito, Ming Gu supposedly had the highest status. However, Ming Gu was unwilling to pay attention to anyone else, so Lady Ghost had no choice but to speak on his behalf.

In reality, Ye Qingtang had deliberately concealed her identity, both to hint to Lady Ghost that she wished to secretly observe the situation and also because… she did not know about the cooperation between the Eternal Dynasty and the Temple of Shadows. She preferred this method to stumbling around and making mistakes.

The Eldest Prince and Princess grew more serious at the mention of business. They told Lady Ghost about the recent events in the Eternal Dynasty.

They wished to seize the throne but needed the support of the Temple of Shadows. So naturally, they had nothing to hide.

“What you are saying is that the Fourth Prince died yesterday and that the position of the crown prince is now vacant?” said Lady Ghost.

The Eldest Prince nodded.

“That’s right. But… the Fourth Prince was very young, so he was no threat even after he became the crown prince. Rather, it is the Second Princess, Ling Yue, and the Third Prince, Ling Yan, who are harder to deal with.”

Ye Qingtang’s heart fluttered at the mention of Ling Yan’s name, but she continued to maintain her composure. She secretly pricked up her ears.

“For many years, the Second Princess, Ling Yue, has been growing closer to the Grand Advisor of the Eternal Dynasty. In recent years, the Grand Advisor has supported Ling Yue’s influence in many areas,” said the Eldest Prince.

“Grand Advisor…” Lady Ghost raised her brows slightly. “Is that the one from the Sacred Ground of Reflection?”

“That’s right,” said the Eldest Prince.

The Sacred Ground of Reflection was one of the major mysterious forces in Central Mainland. It had a rich heritage and was very involved in the various major dynasties. The advisors of all the major dynasties were sent from the Sacred Ground of Reflection. On the surface, they assisted the Emperors in governing the dynasties, but in reality… everyone knew better.

The advisors from the Sacred Ground of Reflection held important positions in every dynasty they were sent to. Even royalty like the Eldest Prince treated them with great deference whenever they met. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The Second Princess’s intentions were perfectly obvious when she had sought support from the advisor.

And it was precisely because the Second Princess had obtained the support of the Sacred Ground of Reflection that the Eldest Prince had hurriedly contacted the Temple of Shadows. He was afraid that the Second Princess would get ahead of them.

Lady Ghost laughed softly but did not question further. She said, “And what about the Third Prince?”

The moment she heard Ling Yan’s name, Ye Qingtang listened even more intently.

The Eldest Prince frowned. “The Third Prince, Ling Yan, is not supported by any base of power. But he is more intelligent than others. He is known to have near demonic brilliance. He is very difficult to deal with, although he is acting alone.”
