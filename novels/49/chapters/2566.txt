Before the Blood Moon Elder could take another step, he was pulled back by Ye Qingtang. She looked at the Blood Moon Elder.

“No need to go over.”

From what the big yellow dog said, Ye Qingtang already knew that there was still a lot of thick karma energy around the Ancient God Karma Tunnel now. If she were to be tainted by a trace of it, she would die or lose at least a layer of skin.

Ye Qingtang’s gaze landed on the big yellow dog.

“Why are you looking at me? Little girl, you are rather ruthless. You stopped this ugly monster from going forward but want me to probe the path ahead. What deep grudge do you have against me?” The big yellow dog wagged its tail at Ye Qingtang.

The corners of Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched. Didn’t this dog promise to help her settle the karma energy around the Ancient God Karma Tunnel?!

“Sigh, forget it. I’ll go then… well, you are leaving for the tunnel… I saw that you still have a lot of food on you. Take them out and leave them behind for us.” The big yellow dog stared at Ye Qingtang.

“Brother Canine, why are you eating that? Have you forgotten… I brought along many of the rare delicacies and elixirs from the Dragon Emperor Clan…” The Blood Moon Elder smiled.

The big yellow dog stared at the Blood Moon Elder and said, “I take back what I said before. You’re not stupid at all.”

“Cut the crap.” Ye Qingtang could not stand this pair of clowns. Had their mothers dropped them on their heads at birth?

The big yellow dog did not say anything else and ran forward quickly. But when the big yellow dog ran to the middle, countless red lights shot towards it like arrows.

However, those extremely powerful karma energies did not affect the dog at all. Not a single strand of fur fell from the big yellow dog’s body.

“Eh…”

When it reached the center, surprise flashed across the eyes of the big yellow dog.

“What’s wrong?” Ye Qingtang frowned slightly. She was afraid that something would happen to the big yellow dog and hurriedly asked. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“I’m fine. I just think that this karma energy is quite powerful,” said the yellow dog.

Soon, the big yellow dog returned and stared at Ye Qingtang. “Alright, the next wave of karma energy will take at least an hour to accumulate. You have to make the best use of this time to see if you are qualified to enter the Ancient God Karma Tunnel. If you are, you can enter. If not, you have to come back quickly.”

Ye Qingtang nodded. After confirming that there was no residual karma energy, she quickly walked towards the red beam.

However, Ye Qingtang had just taken a few steps when the Blood Moon Elder called out to her.

“Holy Lady, when are you coming back… How long do we have to wait?” The Blood Moon Elder asked.
