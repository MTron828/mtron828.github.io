Ye Qingtang had never seen any being as shameless as this dog. Not only had it not repaid her for saving it from the Wailing Well, she now had to grant it a wish.

“Alright, no problem at all. You want to return to the upper realm, right? I will help you. Just you wait, when I have the ability to break the natural laws of this world, I will definitely help you return to the upper realm.” Ye Qingtang laughed coldly.

The big yellow dog immediately wagged its tail with anticipation. “Sure, how long will that take?”

“I’m not sure about that. If we’re lucky, it will only be about a few tens of thousands of years,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Little girl, are you kidding?” The big yellow dog was surprised.

Ye Qingtang smiled. “Who asked you to joke with me first?”

The big yellow dog said, “Pfft, you want to live for tens of thousands of years? You’ll be dead by then. Do you think you’re me, living until the end of time?”

Ye Qingtang was not interested in how long the big yellow dog could live. She was also not interested in whether the big yellow dog could return to the upper realm. The most pressing matter now was how to leave the Dragon Emperor Clan.

For some reason, Ye Qingtang felt that the Dragon Emperor Clan was not as simple as it seemed. Besides, she did not feel safe staying here as an outsider.

The Dragon Emperor Clan had a very strict hierarchical system. The direct bloodline, the different branches and so on were too complicated for Ye Qingtang to understand. And she could not even ask about the direct bloodline.

Ye Qingtang did not grow up in the Dragon Emperor Clan and did not know their rules. If she accidentally violated them, she might end up dying without even knowing why.

Furthermore, there was something that Ye Qingtang was very concerned about. The mountain guard said that Di Jiuyuan’s children had already returned to the Dragon Emperor Clan. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Ye Qingtang was certain that she was Di Jiuyuan’s daughter. However, she was not sure if her mother had other children besides her. In Ye Qingtang’s opinion, there were only two scenarios.

First, she was not her mother’s only daughter. Before or after her, her mother had a son and another daughter. She had siblings that she had never met.

Second, those so-called Di Jiuyuan’s children were fakes.

However, Ye Qingtang could not understand it. The Dragon Emperor Clan was such a major force in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain. Even she, a person from the Blue Sky Domain, knew about them. How could others not know? Who would dare to pretend to be a direct bloodline descendant of the Dragon Emperor Clan?

Furthermore, even if someone was bold enough to pretend, could they fool the Dragon Emperor Clan so easily?

Although Ye Qingtang did not think that she really had siblings whom she had never met, she was not inclined to believe the second scenario.

Actually, according to the information she had, it was extremely likely that she was Di Jiuyuan’s only daughter. But if that was not the case, Ye Qingtang really wished to meet her siblings.

After a long time, Ye Qingtang stopped thinking about it. Anyway, she was still in the Dragon Emperor Clan now. Perhaps she may get a chance to meet the higher-ups.

“Let’s go.”

Ye Qingtang carried the big yellow dog and walked out of her guest room towards the Blood Moon Elder’s room.
