Chapter 2679: Paragon Relic (3)

“Once the Paragon Relic loses its effectiveness, the consequences will be unimaginable.” The Absolute Heaven Saint sighed. “Without the Paragon Relic, the power of the Great Immortal Temple saints alone will not be able to completely suppress the demons. We might be able to hold on for a few years after the Paragon Relic loses its effectiveness, but... if we are unable to reactivate the Paragon Relic soon, the demons will definitely break out of their seal By then, no one can be certain what will happen or what the outcome will be.

Ye Qingtang frowned deeply as she pondered.

There were not many historical records about the Great Immortal Temple. However, Ye Qingtang knew that after this, the Heavenly Demons would break the seal and reappear in the world.

The Heavenly Demons were one of the fiendish demon groups suppressed under the Great Immortal Temple. If their seal was broken, it meant that... the Great Immortal Temple would fall.

Ye Qingtang did not recall much information about the Great Immortal Temple. However, Ye Qingtangwas certain that the Great Immortal Temple did not exist during her era.

Actually, that wasn’t exactly true. It was just that the Great Immortal Temple had long become history by the time her era came.

Ye Qingtang had a strong sense of belonging to the Great Immortal Temple. Be it her Master, the Nine Heavens Saint, the other Uncle-Masters, or even her senior brothers and sisters, they were all like family. It did not have the dominance of a sect, nor did it have the impersonal vibe of an academy.

Even though no one was perfect in the Great Immortal Temple and her senior brothers and sisters might occasionally quarrel or fight, they would reconcile after a few days at most. Ye Qingtang had witnessed much of this over the past few years in the Great Immortal Temple.

Therefore, even though Ye Qingtang did not have a sense of belonging in this era, she still treated the Great Immortal Temple as her home.

In this family, there was no need to worry about saying the wrong thing. As long as you were acknowledged by the Great Immortal Temple as a disciple, you were a part of the family. Everyone was family.

Ye Qingtang did not want history to repeat itself, nor did she want the Great Immortal Temple to disappear from history and become just a past record.

“Uncle-Master, what should we do then... is there no other way?” Ye Qingtang asked the Absolute Heaven Saint anxiously.

“There’s still a chance,” said Absolute Heaven Saint. He looked into the distance. “There might be a second Paragon Relic in the Fourth Domain.” Ye Qingtang’s eyes flickered.

Indeed, the Fourth Domain was left behind by some fallen Immortal Buddha and would definitely harbor an endless number of legacies. And after that

Immortal Buddha died, his body was probably transformed into a Paragon Relic...

If they could obtain that Paragon Relic, they could replace the original relic of the Great Immortal Temple!

“Uncle-Master, in that case, we can contact all the supreme factions present and get them to help us find that relic,” Ye Qingtang said.

This was a major matter that would affect this era. If Ye Qingtang was the leader of a supreme faction, she would definitely be willing to help. After all, if the Great Immortal Temple fell, this world would suffer.

“Ye Yue, you are too naive.” The Absolute Heaven Saint shook his head..
