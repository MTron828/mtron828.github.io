Chapter 1113 A Single Spark Can Start A Prairie Fire (3)

The male in black armor was rather baffled and did not understand why Yin Yang Child glared at him. Was there anything wrong with what he said? Ye Qingtang had many questions in her heart at this moment. If Yin Yang Child and the rest were not present, she really wanted to ask if it was Ling Yan’s doing that the Central Mainland people were trapped in this mainland by the Forbidden Formation. After all, Ye Qingtang instinctively thought of Ling Yan when she heard of this incident.

Yet currently…

It was inconvenient for Ye Qingtang to voice her questions.

If Ling Yan admitted it publicly, all the powerful figures from the Central Mainland, not just Yin Yang Child, would probably itch to skin Ling Yan alive.

Ye Qingtang immediately thought of what Ling Yan said and asked, “Ling Yan, you want me to… kill up north by myself?” The north was currently dominated by You Ancient Clan, but Ling Yan actually wanted her to head there alone?!

Could it be that she accidentally offended this fellow and that he was here to take revenge on her? “Of course, if you wish to bring a few more people, there’s no issue either.” A faint laugh could be heard in Ling Yan’s tone from the voice transmission stone.

“Bullshit!” Yin Yang Child shouted furiously upon hearing Ling Yan. “We are not going!”

Not only Yin Yang Child, everyone present was unwilling to head there. The northern mainland had completely fallen already. Wasn’t it seeking death if they headed to the temporary headquarters of the You Ancient Clan?!

Ye Qingtang could understand their reactions. Thinking from another perspective, she herself would not wish to head over as well.

“Ling Yan, what enmity do you have with this woman to tell her to head to the You Ancient Clan and court death?” Yin Yang Child snickered coldly.

Clearly, Ling Yan did not have any intention to respond to anyone other than Ye Qingtang and did not reply to Yin Yang Child’s cynical remarks.

“Alright, I understand. When do you think I should set off?” Ye Qingtang asked the voice transmission stone a long while later. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Everyone present was stupefied by what Ye Qingtang said.

After interacting with each other for a few days, the Central Mainland people faintly realized that this young girl with alluring looks had completely overturned the old saying of “an outwardly attractive but worthless person” as she was extremely intelligent in reality.

But was she really going after that person called Ling Yan anyhow bluffed her?

Anyone with eyes could tell that heading north now was no different from courting death.

This did not seem like something that Ye Qingtang would agree to…

Or was it to say that… this Ling Yan and this girl had an affair? Otherwise, why would she have so much trust in him?

Ye Qingtang did not know what the others were thinking. Although she felt that what Ling Yan said was unexpected, his judgments had never been wrong to date.Since Ling Yan said that, he must have some insights.

In this crisis, she was willing to take a gamble. Moreover… she did not feel that Ling Yan would harm her.

Just as everyone was still in shock, Ling Yan’s voice rang from the voice transmission stone once again.

“Right now.”

“Alright,” Ye Qingtang said in agreement.

As Ye Qingtang agreed cleanly, a soft chuckle sounded from the voice transmission stone, and Ling Yan’s voice sounded right after.

“Rest assured, Miss Ye. I will stay by your side. You just need to listen to me throughout the journey.”

There was no sound from the voice transmission stone afterward.
