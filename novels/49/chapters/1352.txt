Chapter 1353 Su Qiao 1

“…” Ye Qingtang fell into the God of Nature’s trap again.

Can an ancient god fool people around? VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Don’t they have their morals?

It was totally impossible to guard against their traps!!!

“Just accept it. Since it’s your first time here, I can show you something from the Star Pavilion.” The God of Nature waved his little hands, and a cluster of stars appeared in front of his eyes.

There were numerous spots in the stretch of stars. He touched one of the spots, and then it moved forward. A white jade fan was surrounded by the halo from the star.

“This is the illusory moon feather fan, a heaven-grade divine weapon.” The God of Nature touched the feather fan. He waved his hand again to send the fan away and then touched another star. The star enclosed a top-grade elixir.

“Soul Formation elixir. It can be used to cultivate immortal and Buddha bloodlines.”

Ye Qingtang stared at the two treasures in shock.

Heaven-grade divine weapon?

Soul Formation elixir?

She had never seen these things before.

“There are more. A long as you complete the mission, you can use your nebula points to exchange them. I’m always very generous to explorers.” The God of Nature smiled and said.

Ye Qingtang looked at the Star Pavilion that was dispersed by the God of Nature with perplexed feelings.

The God of Nature was an ancient god, and he definitely possessed many treasures. Nothing from those normal mystic realms could compare with these.

Though it still felt like a trap…

Those things really piqued Ye Qingtang’s great interest.

Furthermore…

She had entered the world, and there was no way that she could leave before completing the mission. The spirit energy here was not bad. Cultivating here for one day could be equal to three days in the Central Mainland.

“Alright… What’s the mission?” Ye Qingtang said with mixed feelings. She did not trust the God of Nature completely.

The God of Nature smiled, and a light flashed out from his finger into Ye Qingtang’s temple.

As the light diffused in, strange memories started to appear in Ye Qingtang’s brain.

Those memories belonged to the owner of this room.

The owner was called Su Qiao. Her father was a general, and her mother passed away after giving birth to her. Her father married another woman and had other children.

Su Qiao was not born by the current General’s wife, and she was always neglected here. She was intimidated and had no talent, so even her father did not adore her.

The only hope that Su Qiao had was the arranged marriage to the prime minister’s son. They planned to get married when Su Qiao turned sixteen. However, on the wedding day, Su Qiao’s fiance annulled the engagement and chose her sister Su Mo’er as his wife in front of everyone.

Su Qiao was too upset and went crazy. She was then locked inside the room and got crazier.

Besides Su Qiao’s identity, Ye Qingtang acquired some other information about the world here.

Though the spirit energy here was very intense, people here had no spirit root and did not know how to cultivate spirit energy. What they called martial art was just some basic skills to Ye Qingtang…

This is really… a huge waste!

She could not believe that they left such intense spirit energy untouched here.
