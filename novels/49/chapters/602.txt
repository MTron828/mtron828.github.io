Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“You… You have a simple… and kind… heart… It’s a good thing… but also a bad one… In this world, one may know a person’s face… but not his heart. From now on… you must not tell… anyone about… the Heart of the Demon God in your body…” The ape’s body quivered, and color slowly drained from his eyes as though he was at the point of death.

“I hate… I hate… that I have not… saved my father… nor have I… become the number one… in the demon clan… I am not resigned to this… I hate this so much…” The ape muttered.

A repressed sound escaped from Beidou Demon Lord’s blood-stained lips, and his furry hands clutched on Ye Qingtang tightly. Suddenly, all force was lost from his hands, which hung down weakly right after…

“Bro… Brother!” The lady screamed in grief. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

For three whole days, the lady sat beside the ape without consuming anything. With no more tears left to cry, her empty eyes were filled with repression as she looked at the ape beside her.

If not for her, how would Beidou Demon Lord have died…

If not for her…

Ye Qingtang stood there for a long time. As she watched herself from her previous life sit in front of Beidou Demon Lord, it was as if a huge boulder weighed down on her heart.

Even if she knew the scene before her was only an illusion from her previous life, but… she once again saw the scene of her brother dying because of her…

After a long time, the lady buried Beidou Demon Lord there and walked into the forest.

Once the lady left, Ye Qingtang walked forward and knelt before Beidou Demon Lord’s new grave. She swore to herself with a firm expression in her eyes. “Brother… In this lifetime, I will definitely protect your safety!”

Beidou Demon Lord was her first sworn brother in her previous lifetime and died on this unnamed island in order to protect her.

His dream was not even accomplished…

“I, Ye Qingtang, swear to destroy Sacred Martial Academy and Central Dynasty and to help Brother to rescue his father. In this life, I must not let Brother have a tragic death!”

Ye Qingtang obtained a bottle of wine from her space ring.

She drank half of the bottle and subsequently poured the other half in front of the grave.

This was the Beidou Demon Lord from her previous life, but… she was reborn, and time reversed. In this life, Beidou Demon Lord was still alive.

As Ye Qingtang looked at herself from her past life cultivate painstakingly every day, she did not know what to feel.

After Beidou Demon Lord had sent her to this island in her previous life, Ye Qingtang lived on this island for half a year and discovered some secrets of the origins of the demon clan and the Central Dynasty royals from the relics on the island.

One day when the turbulent storms of the Dead Sea disappeared, Ye Qingtang finally left this place.

After leaving the sea of death, Ye Qingtang headed to other mainlands and never returned here.

“These are my mental demons… You wish to make use of my mental demons and trap me in it forever, don’t you…” Ye Qingtang’s eyes were firm. Despite all the twists and turns, her mind was still as resolute. She scoffed. “That’s looking down on me too much already.”

“Holy Lady…”

Suddenly, a vague voice sounded from nowhere.

As this voice emerged, the sky shattered into pieces immediately like glass.

Once Ye Qingtang opened her eyes, she realized that she had returned to the third palace.

At that instant, Ye Qingtang was holding the Demonic Blood Sword and pointed it straight at the Blood Moon Elder.

“Holy Lady, wake up… I’m going to retaliate!” The Blood Moon Elder shouted at Ye Qingtang frantically.

Previously, the Blood Moon Elder followed Ye Qingtang into the third palace, but he suddenly saw Ye Qingtang holding onto the Demonic Blood Sword and slashing towards him instantly, behaving no different from those who had lost their minds.
