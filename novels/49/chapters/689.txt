Chapter 690: So What If I Slap You (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Was this beautiful young man crazy!!

He actually… slapped… Shangguan Rui?!

“Still complete annihilation?” A faint smile slowly appeared on Ye Qingtang’s handsome face as she watched the dumbfounded Shangguan Rui.

“You…” Shangguan Rui was slightly stunned, but the stinging pain on his cheeks reminded him of everything that happened a while ago. When he returned to his senses, he glared at Ye Qingtang furiously. “Son of a bitch! How dare you hit me!! I want you to die without a place to be buried! I want to chop off your head and dig out your eyes!”

“Oh?” Ye Qingtang looked at the enraged Shangguan Rui with interest.

Without waiting for Shangguan Rui to continue cursing at her, Ye Qingtang suddenly raised her hand again!

Pow!

Before everyone’s eyes, Ye Qingtang slapped Shangguan Rui’s cheeks heavily once again.

Within seconds, a few handprints emerged on Shangguan Rui’s face.

Never had Shangguan Rui dreamed that he would suffer two consecutive slaps. He glared at Ye Qingtang with bloodshot eyes before shouting sternly to the indifferent guard behind him. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Kill… Kill him. Kill this son of a bitch!”

“Noted.” The indifferent guard nodded.

In the next second, a Martial Qi Level Three First Heaven aura emerged around the guard and completely enshrouded Ye Qingtang.

Everyone was taken aback after sensing the indifferent guard’s aura.

“Martial Qi Level Three, First Heaven!”

“This person’s skills are actually so scary! He has already surpassed the elite disciples of super sects!”

“Hmph. This person is Shangguan Rui’s martial teacher and is also his personal bodyguard. He is one of the Dragon-Tiger General’s trusted subordinates!”

“That foreigner fellow will definitely die without a doubt!”

Everyone was extremely shocked after sensing the indifferent guard’s Martial Qi Level Three First Heaven aura.

“Die!”

With a shout, a powerful martial aura immediately erupted out from that guard like a jet, and his palm rammed towards Ye Qingtang.

However, when his palm was less than three inches away from Ye Qingtang, the little white tiger in Ye Qingtang’s arm suddenly spouted out a trail of white flame.

“WHAT?!”

Sensing the force of destruction in this flame, the indifferent guard was alarmed. It was already too late for him to dodge.

“Arh!!!”

The indifferent guard let out a miserable cry as he burned into ashes after being hit by the white flame.

“F*ck you. You must be seeking death. How dare you think of attacking me!” the little white tiger said furiously.

“…” Ye Qintang looked blankly at the little white tiger.

“He wanted to attack me just now…” Ye Qingtang reminded the little white tiger.

“Oh… F*ck. He didn’t say it earlier… Whatever though. I said that I would be responsible for you. I will protect you.” The little white tiger grinned at Ye Qingtang.

After absorbing large amounts of evil aura in the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm, the little white tiger’s infant body currently had the combat power of a human at the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three, and it could easily kill a mere Martial Qi Level Three First Heaven cultivator.

“Such a powerful spirit animal!”

“It killed a Martial Qi Level Three First Heaven in an instant!”

“I was thinking why that fellow was so fearless. So it’s because he has such a powerful spirit animal as his backing!”

“Hmph. The ignorant are fearless. He dares to act like this just by relying on one spirit animal… The Dragon-Tiger General should have already received news of this. We’ll just watch how he dies later!”

In the crowd, Zhou Fu’s eyes twinkled as he stared at the little white tiger in Ye Qingtang’s arms. If he could obtain that spirit animal…
