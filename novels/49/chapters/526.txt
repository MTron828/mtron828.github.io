Chapter 527 What is a Sect (3)

Though the price was huge, the Yunxiao Sect elder managed to destroy the two array formations.

“Xuanling Sect… I really looked down on their power and background!”

The elder who lost an arm gritted his teeth.

The Xuanling Sect had killed near ten of their elite inner sect disciples, three sect wardens, and one of his arms before they even engaged in the fight!

From what the Yunxiao Sect knew in the past, Xuanling Sect’s quality was the worst compared to that of the Wind Moon Sect and the Qinglin Sect. That was the reason why they thought that Xuanling Sect’s power and background was the worst as well.

However…

The Yunxiao Sect elders and the wardens realized that they were wrong only at this moment.

Xuanling Sect’s power and background were not ordinary.

Rare array formations like the Golden Formation, Heaven Elimination Formation, and the Earth Killing Formation could not be used by weak sects.

Xuanling Sect’s power was definitely not the weakest in the three sects. It might be the strongest! 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

After the two formations were destroyed by the Yunxiao Sect elder with the price of an arm, Yunxiao Sect disciples and wardens rushed inside without any concern.

“Kill everyone who intrudes the Xuanling Sect!”

Feng Moli’s body turned into a ball of red flame and dashed towards the Yunxiao Sect disciples.

Whiz!

Whiz!

Whiz!

Those stronger inner sect disciples of Xuanling Sect rushed along with Feng Moli towards the Yunxiao Sect disciples immediately. The voices seemed to be able to break through the sky and exploded beside one’s ears.

Feng Moli’s ability was among the top ten in the Xuanling Sect. He was also one of the ten core disciples of the sect. He had entered the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two and possessed a fire-elemental Paragon Skill. After the Treasure Pavilion was opened, he took out a dream fire-elemental weapon. His Paragon Skill was strengthened by a few times with the weapon as the source.

One of the Yunxiao Sect disciples moved swiftly and blocked Feng Moli’s way. His cold eyesight landed on Feng Moli, and it was full of disdain

Swoosh!

He pulled out his sword and slashed down towards Feng Moli.

In almost a split second, Feng Moli’s body turned into flames and spread out.

“The Paragon Skill?!”

Some Yunxiao Sect disciples also paid attention over.

The Paragon Skill was rare in the Yunxiao Sect as well. Only two people possessed the Paragon Skill.

One of them was the Holy Lady Ye You, and the other one was Ning Luo.

When Ning Luo was on the undercover mission at the Xuanling Sect, he purposely hid his Paragon Skill. However, the Yunxiao Sect knew about that.

Once cultivators understood the Paragon Skill, it could compensate for the differences in cultivation levels. They could kill someone of higher levels easily. Now that Feng Moli possessed the Xuanling Sect’s fire-elemental weapon, his power was too great to be defended.

“Scorching Sun!”

Soon, flames concentrated in the air and reformed Feng Moli’s body. He said the words softly and extended his index finger. Huge scorching flames were concentrated. The flames were like the burning sun in the sky.

The flame dashed into the sky at the next second. It swiped through the sky swiftly, and the air seemed to evaporate under the high temperature.

The Yunxiao Sect disciple frowned and tried to defend the flame with his sword.

Boom!

The sun-like flames exploded, and that disciple took a few steps back under the force.

A few Yunxiao Sect disciples rushed over when they witnessed there was someone of the Xuanling Sect who possessed the Paragon Skill.

“It’s none of your business when Junior Brother Feng is in a one-on-one fight!”

A furious roar spread through the place, and a man used his physical power to hit one of the Yunxiao Sect disciples who intended to interfere away.
