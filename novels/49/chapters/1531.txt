1532 Who Says I“m Not A Baby 1

Jiang Yu, who had already drunk the holy water, glanced at Emperor Yan as if looking at a fool. “The holy water only removes the curse on our bodies. If you want to be fully restored, you still have to leave this accursed place. As for your body and powers being restored... Haha... you’ll have to wait a long while.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The hopeful Emperor Yan looked utterly crushed when he heard Jiang Yu’s words. He collapsed and sat on the ground.

Everyone had heard the legend of the Age Reversal Curse, but few had ever angered a deity enough to suffer this curse. After the curse was lifted, they could continue to grow gradually over time, but as for whether they could recover the powers that had been worn away by the Age Reversal Curse...

No one could say for sure.

Emperor Yan wilted like a frost-stricken vegetable.

They had been trapped for ten thousand years, lost their powerful abilities, and had been reduced to helpless children. To these powerful figures, this was a devastating blow.

Now, their only hope was that the curse had been lifted. After a few years, they should be able to recover their physical bodies without any problem. But as for their abilities...

If they could not recover their abilities, they would need to start cultivating again, and who knew how long that would take?

The powerful figures were inwardly despondent. Then, they discovered something even more depressing.

Jiang Yu had fleeced them. They thought that this forbidden ground was dangerous and that it would be better to give their treasure to him and preserve their lives. But now...

This temple was perfectly safe. So they felt... cheated.

Everyone turned resentful eyes to Ye Qingtang and Jiang Yu, who were now loaded.

Jiang Yu thought nothing of it. He had finally gotten his own back.

But Ye Qingtang began to think. No one was sure if they could recover their abilities after the Age Reversal Curse was lifted. Although everyone here was just a child, they originally were the most powerful figures in the Second Domain.

If they recovered their abilities one day, many would recall today’s events with resentment.

Ye Qingtang did not wish to leave bad memories among so many powerful figures.

So Ye Qingtang calmed herself, looked at the dissatisfied crowd of children, and spoke.

“Today, you have been released from the curse and are free to leave this place. But you must be careful when you leave. The border of the forbidden place is shrouded by thick fog, which will attack anyone exiting the place. There are also strange things in the fog which will flay you...”

The group of powerful figures, who had been feeling discontent, could not help but tremble inwardly at Ye Qingtang’s words.

They were now a group of small children with little fighting skills. If the thick fog and the things in the fog were as Ye Qingtang described, how would they get out?

This place had been cursed by the deity. They could not level up here.

“Let’s just go ahead and check out the situation.” Jiang Yu was not as worried as them. After all, he still had Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang nodded. With that, she led everyone and walked to the border of the forbidden land under the protection of the three Demonic Bears.

The bodies of the Jiang Family disciples were still lying there. Everyone saw their tragic downfall as they lay there, disemboweled. But no one reacted.

Everyone present was used to this way of dying.

But Jiang Yu noticed that these men who had died recently were wearing the Jiang Family robes. From their injuries and half-eaten intestines, he concluded that they must have been attacked by the Demonic Bears.
