Chapter 560 A Story (1)

Within the barrier, Qin Huan, Zhu Changge, Yun Shu, and other disciples—even Feng Moli—followed Qin Huan and insulted Yunxiao Sect loudly, which invigorated them.

On the contrary, the expressions of the Yunxiao Sect disciples were extremely ugly, and they died to tear the Xuanling Sect disciples into pieces. Yet, they were helpless.

On that day, the Yunxiao Sect’s Sect Master was enraged after learning of what happened.

Not only was Xuanling Sect not annihilated, they instead let Yuehua Sect and Lingyun Sect learn about the matter, and even the divine beast was heavily injured! Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Li Chenfeng was in a bad mood after being reprimanded by the Sect Master. If Ye Qingtang had not pretended to be a Blood Moon Guardian and lead the Blood Moon Sect masses there…

Yunxiao Sect directly placed Ye Qingtang in the Assassination Roll, and the reward even surpassed that of the first person on the Assassination Roll!

Whoever captured Ye Qingtang alive could select any Dharma treasure in Yunxiao Sect!

Many Yunxiao Sect elite disciples viewed Ye Qingtang as prey and were eager to give it a try. This was a chance where they could achieve instant success.

In the dark night, outside a pavilion in Yunxiao Sect.

The candlelight in the room shone brightly and emitted a faint aroma.

Ning Luo was dressed in white with a chessboard before him.

As Ning Luo held a chess piece, an unknown smile hung on his lips.

A mysterious person who was wrapped in a black robe all over sat on the other side of the chessboard.

“This piece is still alive.” Ning Luo chuckled softly.

The black-robed man did not respond, seeming to be fully focused on playing chess.

“This group of Yunxiao Sect mobs… was of great help.” The corners of Ning Luo’s lips curled up slightly.

“The plan… is brought forward because of Ye Qingtang. This does not matter though. Everything is under control.” A deep voice sounded from the black robe.

“Only when this game of chess is full of variables would it be exciting, and only as such would we, chess players, be even more serious,” Ning Luo said.

As he said that, a smile that sent shudders could be seen on Ning Luo’s face as he glimpsed at the door.

“Senior Brother Zhuo, after hiding outside my door and listening for such a long time, why don’t you come on in?” Ning Luo’s emotionless voice sounded.

Immediately, Senior Brother Zhuo’s expression changed drastically.

This Senior Brother Zhuo was the Yunxiao Sect inner sect disciple who first rescued Ning Luo away.

He initially came today to find Ning Luo to talk about assassinating Ye Qingtang. After all, Ning Luo hid in Xuanling Sect for a long time and should have some understanding towards Ye Qingtang’s abilities. Yet unexpectedly, there was actually an outsider in Ning Luo’s room, and the two of them seemed to be secretly plotting something!

Seeing that Ning Luo discovered him, Senior Brother Zhuo’s expression changed, and he left immediately. He must notify this matter to Holy Lady Ye You and the Sect Master!

“Ah…” Ning Luo sighed. “You came without greeting and left without bidding goodbye. What did you treat my place as?”

Afterward, as Ning Luo focused on the chessboard, his right palm stretched forward slightly.

In an instant, a strange light erupted from Ning Luo’s palm.

Outside the door, Senior Brother Zhuo was overwhelmed with horror. He could not control his body and floated into Ning Luo’s room.

In just two breaths, Senior Brother Zhuo was grabbed by his throat by Ning Luo.

However, Ning Luo never batted him an eye and smiled at the black-robed man. “It’s your turn.”

The black-robed man treated Senior Brother Zhuo as non-existent and focused on the chess game.

“Junior… Junior Brother Ning Luo… What… What exactly are you…” Senior Brother Zhuo was shocked.

From his memory, Ning Luo’s skills could only be considered ordinary amongst the Yunxiao Sect inner sect disciples. Yet unexpectedly…

“Senior Brother Zhuo,” Ning Luo said softly and interrupted him. “Since you came to my residence, as part of playing the host, let me tell you a story.”
