Chapter 1185: Attack (3)

“There’s a surprise attack. Quickly inform the General!”

A You Ancient Clan powerful figure saw dozens of Yang Lords in the air, and his expression changed drastically. The South battlefield was already in their control, so where did these dozens of Yang Lords appear from?!

“Die!”

With a furious yell, Blood Moon Elder stepped forward and crushed that You Ancient Clan powerful figure with his foot.

“Elder… Elder Yin Fo has mutinied!”

Plenty of powerful figures were shocked when they noticed the Blood Moon Elder’s enormous body invading Dragon Elephant City and killing the You Ancient Clan people.

A huge war erupted in Dragon Elephant City at this instant, with dozens of Yang Lords and hundreds of young disciples within Yin Yang Perfected Lord Fourth Heaven to Sixth Heaven launching attacks under Ye Qingtang’s lead.

There were few people defending Elephant Dragon City to begin with. In just an hour, the Ancient You Clan figures defending Dragon Elephant City were all killed; thus, Dragon Elephant City was conquered by Ye Qingtang.

Sometime later, the You Ancient Clan army finally received the news and rushed back to Dragon Elephant City at top speed.

However, the overall General’s expression changed once he returned to Dragon Elephant City. The city had already fallen and was conquered by that lady who defeated You Tianhe! 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“You have a death wish!”

The elderly, who was the overall General of this troop, bellowed loudly. “Attack Dragon Elephant City. Spare no one!”

Nonetheless, just as he spoke, the Blood Moon Elder appeared and stared at the elderly from a commanding position, thanks to his enormous body, which made him look like a giant. “Come and try to attack.”

“Elder Yin Fo…”

The You Ancient Clan was shocked to see the Blood Moon Elder. Elder Yin Fo actually… mutinied?!

In a flash, dozens of Yang Lords floated above Dragon Elephant City with hundreds of Yin Yang Perfected Lord soldiers at both sides. It was an appalling force.

“The South battlefield… actually has so many more Yang Lords?!” The elderly’s expression changed.

Currently, Dragon Elephant City was conquered by many powerful figures, and it was unrealistic if they wished to attack by force especially when the Blood Moon Elder’s combat abilities were overly frightening…

“Haha… Good, you all can conquer Dragon Elephant City and not come out. Wait for us to invade Heaven City!” The elderly had a gloomy expression as he roared in fury.

“Whatever,” Ye Qingtang said coldly.

Since Dragon Elephant City was already conquered, Ye Qingtang would naturally not give it out, and using Heaven City to threaten her was even more of a joke.

For an instant, both parties were in a stalemate, with one party encircling the city from the outside while the other remained in the city.

“Let’s go!”

Sometime later, the You Ancient Clan elderly shouted coldly and led the You Ancient Clan away from Dragon Elephant City.

The people in the city cheered boisterously upon noticing the situation.

After ascertaining that this You Ancient Clan troop left completely, Ye Qingtang headed to the hall of the main city.

The You Ancient Clan left plenty of resources behind in Dragon Elephant City: apart from large quantities of food and water, there were still many treasures stored.

Elder Bai Kui exclaimed in a secret chamber of the main hall, and he subsequently walked toward Ye Qingtang with a jet-black gourd in his hands.

“Eldest Young Lady, look at this!” Elder Bai Kui walked forward and handed the jet-black gourd to Ye Qingtang.

“Heaven Soul Gourd…” Ye Qingtang took the black gourd over and was surprised after inspecting it for a while.

Heaven Soul Gourd was one of the ultimate Dharma treasures of this mainland. It could gather the power of souls and had been lost for a long time. No one expected that it was actually obtained by the You Ancient Clan and was placed in Dragon Elephant City.
