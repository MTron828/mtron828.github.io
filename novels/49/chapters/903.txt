Chapter 904 It’s You Whom I Am Hitting (6)

“That’s right. Senior Sister Ye has some grudges with Perfected Gu Yun. She killed him with one strike and saved our lives!” Gu Tianhe nodded in agreement.

“Older by how many batches? Three batches?!” Li Xiu was astonished. “Junior Brother Feng… Junior Brother Gu, do you all know… how many years there are in a batch?”

The two of them were taken aback by the question and shook their heads. “I’m not too clear.”

The two of them had only entered the Supreme Academy to cultivate for around ten years. To Supreme Academy, these ten plus years were already considered short.

“Do you all know… how old Supreme Academy’s chief disciple, Senior Brother Long Qingyu, is this year?” Li Xiu asked with a complicated expression.

“He should be around two hundred years old…” Gu Tianhe said instinctively.

“You said she is from three batches above… In that case, she is at least six hundred years old?!” Li Xiu asked, alarmed.

Six hundred years old?!

Everyone was astonished to hear that. This young, beautiful lady is actually six hundred years old?!

Everyone knew that once one’s martial cultivation reached the Arcane Supremacy realm, the speed of their aging would slow down tremendously. Upon reaching the Heavenly Venerate realm, one could completely remain young and maintain their youthful appearance if there was a need…

“What a joke!” The leader of the Divine Virtual Academy disciples shouted coldly. “You all said that she killed Perfected Gu Yun?! Do you all think that I’m a kid who is so easily fooled?! If that’s the case, what evidence do you all have?”

Although the two Divine Virtual Academy disciples said the same thing, the young leader did not believe them so easily. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Evidence?” Feng Wudang looked at Gu Tianhe, and his eyes flickered. “Show them the evidence.”

Gu Tianhe nodded and subsequently retrieved a skull from his space ring.

The eyes on that skull were still wide open in fury and did not rest in peace. If he was not Perfected Gu Yun, who else could it be?!

“Sssss…”

After seeing Perfected Gu Yun’s head, everyone from both Supreme Academy and Divine Virtual Academy gasped.

The head in Gu Tianhe’s hand was none other than Perfected Gu Yun’s head!

“This… This this this…”

The leader of the Divine Virtual Academy disciples was shaken when he looked at Perfected Gu Yun’s skull.

“Senior Brother… Three batches ago… Supreme Academy seemed… to have really produced a Heavenly Venerate!” a Divine Virtual Academy disciple said cautiously at that moment.

After hearing the conversation between the Divine Virtual Academy and Supreme Academy, Ye Qingtang, as the center of the discussion, was confused.

Previously, she had already planned to use the Heavenly Demon Pearl’s divine power to escape. Who would have thought that those two Divine Virtual Academy disciples would actually jump out to say that she killed Perfected Gu Yun…

“Ling Yan… Could it be that this… is also in your scheme?” For some reason, Ye Qingtang immediately thought of Ling Yan.

If she guessed correctly, those two Divine Virtual Academy disciples who hid in the dark happened to be there and witnessed her killing Perfected Gu Yun because of Ling Yan’s scheme…

Since she already had a pretty good idea of the situation, she knew how she should settle this matter already.

“You are the imp of the Feng clan?!”
