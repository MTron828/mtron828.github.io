Qin Feng was very relieved.

In next to no time, Qin Feng stood up and walked out of the door. His right hand held the hilt of his sword lightly while his eyes were half-closed.

“Destroy!”

Qin Feng let out a soft shout, and his eyes suddenly opened wide. With a clang, the sword at his waist was unsheathed.

Qin Feng soared into the sky and swung his sword.

“Swoosh!”

The place seemed to have become a kingdom of swords as shadows crisscrossed in all directions. Sword qi seemed to descend from the sky numbering in the tens of millions. Sword intent burst forth. Qin Feng seemed to have an endless sword intent. Noone dared to look directly at him.

“This…”

The Yongle Tribe General was speechless.

In the past, he thought that this piece of metal was a useless object. Never did the Yongle Tribe General imagine that it could actually create such a miraculous effect in Qin Feng’s hands.

General Yongle thought that if Qin Feng did not limit his strength, the number of sword light alone would be enough to instantly decimate all the demons in the Yongle Tribe. Not a single one would be able to escape.

“Eh, there’s also me. Do you want to see my divine powers?!”

Nangong Lie suddenly ran out. “Look at my hand!”

The Yongle Tribe General instinctively looked towards Nangong Lie’s palm.

In the next second, a ball of flames appeared in Nangong Lie’s palm.

“This is… the power of nature. Ancestor, you can control the power of nature?” The Yongle Tribe General asked in surprise.

“So can I. Look…”

This time, it was Lei Yan who spoke. However, before Lei Yan could finish speaking, Ye Qingtang glared at him.

Had Lei Yan and Nangong Lie forgotten their current situation? Why were they still showing off in front of the Yongle Tribe General?

...

“Ancestor, do you have any divine abilities?” A moment later, General Yongle’s gaze landed on the big yellow dog beside Ye Qingtang.

In the Yongle Tribe General’s opinion, it must be extraordinary to be able to follow Ancestor Qing.

The big yellow dog wagged its tail and looked up at the Yongle Tribe General. “Give me your hand.”

“Okay.”

The Yongle Tribe General was confused but he still reached out his hand. Before the Yongle Tribe General could react, the big yellow dog bit his hand.

The Yongle Tribe General, “…”

“I’m a dog. This is my divine power,” said the big yellow dog as it let go.

The Yongle Tribe General smiled awkwardly.

“Alright, that’s all for today. We will leave in a few days, but when Ancestor Qing is free, I will ask him to come back and teach you the divine arts,” said the Flying Star Academy teacher.

“Yes, sir.” The Yongle Tribe General cupped his fists.

...

Soon, Ye Qingtang returned to the room.

Ye Qingtang touched the big yellow dog’s tail and pulled it over.

“What are you doing? Don’t pull my tail, otherwise I will suffer from indigestion.” The big yellow dog looked at Ye Qingtang unhappily.

“Heavens, what did you do just now?” Ye Qingtang smiled as she stroked the big yellow dog’s fur.

“What did I do?” The yellow dog was confused.

“Stop pretending. That West Sea Tribe General…” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“Oh, you’re talking about that? No need to thank me, it’s just a small matter.” The big yellow dog wagged its tail.

Ye Qingtang, “…”

There was no need to think too much. The reason why she had been able to subdue the West Sea Tribe General was definitely because of the big yellow dog. Other than that, Ye Qingtang could not find any other reason.

She really had picked up a treasure…T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m
