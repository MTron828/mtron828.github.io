Chapter 24: Pavilion of Treasures (3)

The assistant ignored Ye Qingtang though she had stood in front of the counter for quite a while. However, he came over in an instant once he saw Duan Tianrui waving a hand.

“Mr Duan, how may I be of service?”

Duan Tianrui pointed to the Flora moonstone displayed in the counter: “Take this out.”

The assistant promptly took the moonstone out from its display, “This Flora moonstone just arrived yesterday. I’m afraid you can’t find another one resembling its luster in this world.”

Duan Tianrui was pleased with its quality upon a closer inspection. Not forgetting his opponent, he raised his eyes and looked at Ye Qingtang.

“How much does this cost?”

The assistant replied: “Thirty thousand gold.”

The price he quoted was “loud” enough to draw the attention of the other patrons within the boutique.

For a moonstone the size of a pea to be worth a whopping thirty thousand gold!

Heavens knew the price was not an amount the common folk could earn in a lifetime.

Even the aristocrats might have difficulty forking out such an exorbitant amount.

“Thirty thousand…. Miss Ye, are you still keen on this?” Duan Tianrui observed Ye Qingtang. He had long since known from Duan Tianrao, that the Great Elder had subverted all authority from Ye Ling, the head of the Ye household. Thus as his daughter, Ye Qingtang could be considered a “lady of the household” in name only. She could never afford to pay such a large sum of money now that her family’s finances were controlled by the Great Elder as well.

Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes, flashing a chilling glare.

Some surrounding patrons cast their eyes over this rivalry between the two households, but when they realized Ye Qingtang was the one representing the Ye household, they shook their heads discreetly.

Although the matter with Duan Tianrao renouncing her engagement had yet to befall, its rumors were already spread around the City of Lin. This public dispute with Duan Tianrui only got to prove its validity.

Summing up all those rumors flying around made everyone realize, this lady of the Ye household was no longer as cherished as she used to be.

How will she compete with Duan Tianrui?

An attendant accompanying his master was at a corner surveying a selection of jades when he traced his sight towards the commotion. He was shocked by what he witnessed before informing his master hastily:

“Young master, its Miss Ye!”

Si Bai put down a piece of white jade, before turning his head towards the direction the attendant was pointing at. From the crowd, he was able to distinguish that petite yet familiar figure. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Ye Qingtang?”

“Young master, it seems Miss Ye had gotten into an argument with members of the Duan household. Shall we go and have a look?” The attendant asked precariously.

Si Bai did not rush to give an answer but just observed from a distance, at the girl who stood solo as her eyes gleamed with amusement. He chuckled and shook his head, “That’s not necessary. She has a way with that.”

Ye Qingtang’s smile was all too familiar, just like the time when she was contending with his grandfather at the Si household, she exuded a confident and triumphant demeanor.

But Si Bai did not turn his gaze away, as he was curious about how she was going to resolve this predicament.

On the other hand, Duan Tianrui was maliciously enjoying every bit of her predicament while toying with the moonstone on his hand.

He had long been dissatisfied with the engagement between Ye Qingtang and Duan Tianrao. His older brother, a ladies’ man, having to cope with a wife as hideous as her? Thank goodness their engagement was called off. Without that relationship, he need not play nice with her anymore.
