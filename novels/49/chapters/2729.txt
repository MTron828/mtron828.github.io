Chapter 2730: The Second Tian (1)

“That is my reason for not killing you,” Ye Qingtang said.

The woman in green looked pensive. “So, who are you… the reincarnation of the Silver Star Holy Lord? Or the black shadow who killed my former self?”

“Neither,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Then how did you witness that scene and know my identity in my previous life?” The lady in green’s hostility towards Ye Qingtang had mostly dissipated.

“Because… the reincarnation of the Silver Star Holy Lord… is someone I… like,” Ye Qingtang muttered.

“So, what you saw… is because of the Silver Star Holy Lord?” The woman in green seemed to be in deep thought.

Without giving Ye Qingtang a chance to speak, the woman in green said softly, “So that’s how it is… It seems that my actions in this lifetime have disgraced my reputation in my previous lifetime… Do you know who the black shadow that killed me and the Silver Star Holy Lord is?”

Ye Qingtang shook her head. How would she know?

“Can you let me see the reincarnation of the Silver Star Holy Lord? I have some things I want to understand more,” the lady in green said softly after a long time.

“I don’t know where he is now. However, if necessary, he will find you,” Ye Qingtang said.

“I understand.” The woman in green nodded and turned to leave. “Thank you.”

...

After the woman in green left, the Blood Moon Elder hurried forward. “Holy Lady, what… what happened?!”

“Nothing.” Ye Qingtang shook her head. This matter was too complicated.

“Little girl, the Ancient God Karma Tunnel… You entered a blessed land and were reborn.” The big yellow dog wagged its tail.

“I guess so.” Ye Qingtang chuckled.

Although the distant era was not a blessed land, it was even better for her to have visited that past era.

“Let’s go to the Dragon Emperor Clan.”

Ye Qingtang waved and disappeared with the Blood Moon Elder and the big yellow dog.

When they reappeared, they were already inside the Dragon Emperor Clan.

“Holy Lady… how did you do that?!” They had already arrived at the Dragon Emperor Clan?!

Ye Qingtang smiled but did not explain.

“The daughter of Di Jiuyuan is here. Evil Deity, please show yourself,” Ye Qingtang said softly.

Although her voice was soft, it echoed in every corner of the Dragon Emperor City.

Before long, two figures landed.

“Who is pretending to be the daughter of my mother, Di Jiuyuan!” One of the young men shouted coldly.

“You’re Di Jiuyuan’s son?”

Ye Qingtang’s gaze landed on the man.

“Of course.”

The man sneered.

“What about you?” Ye Qingtang looked at the woman.

“Di Jiuyuan is my mother. Who are you? You dare to pretend to be my mother’s daughter?!” the woman said coldly.

Before Ye Qingtang had a chance to reply, dozens of powerful figures from the Dragon Emperor Clan arrived.

The leader was an extremely dignified old man.

“Miss Ye, what are you doing?” Elder Long looked at Ye Qingtang with a deep frown.

Ye Qingtang had left not long ago, explaining that she had to go and settle a personal matter. Why did she return so soon… and to think that she was now claiming to be Di Jiuyuan’s daughter… Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

What was going on?!

Ye Qingtang’s eyes never left the couple.
