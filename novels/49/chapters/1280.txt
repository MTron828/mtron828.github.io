Chapter 1281: Do Me A Favor? (1)

What should they do?

How would he know?!

At that moment, Long Yang wished he could give himself two tight slaps.

If he had known who they were, he would not have dared to provoke them under any circumstances!

Now…

Long Yang felt like his world was about to collapse.

“Holy Lord of Shadows, have mercy! I failed to recognize you and offended you. Please, Lord, have mercy and allow me to live.” At that moment, Long Yang had lost all of his former smugness.

He frantically kneeled on the ground and crawled over to Ye Qingtang. He banged his head loudly on the ground as he kowtowed, hoping to save his own life.

The others from the Long Family also kneeled and kowtowed vigorously.

Just the Holy Son alone could kill them as easily as he could squash an ant. Now, the Holy Lord of Shadows was here in person!

Long Yang was petrified. Even if the Long Family Master were to arrive, he would also be sweating with terror.

This was the Temple of Shadows!

Ye Qingtang looked at the quivering bunch from the Long Family, who were kneeling on the ground. Her eyes showed no trace of pity.

Although she was neither the real Holy Lord nor an Undead, she had heard much about the Long Family’s doings in her previous life.

The Long Family not only enslaved the Undead, but they had also gone around capturing the Undead who had escaped to the mountains. The Long Family would not let a single one off, no matter whether they were young or old, or what kind of character they had.

They either kept them for their own use or sold them to other powers.

They did not treat the Undead Clan with equality. To them, these innocent Undead were no more than stray dogs to be used.

Even the evil fighting arenas were parts of the Long Family’s business.

They forced the Undead to fight each other for entertainment.

Right now, Ye Qingtang did not mind performing the duties of the Holy Lord of Shadows. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Don’t leave a single one,” Ye Qingtang said calmly. Her voice rang out like a death knell.

To her, race was not important. Evil people had no right to remain on this land.

Ming Gu did not have any suspicions of Ye Qingtang’s instructions. He immediately acted.

“Holy Lord, have mercy!”

The Long Family saw that death was imminent and immediately began pleading in terror.

“Stop!” A low shout suddenly rang out.

A tall figure flew over from the void and landed in front of Long Yang and the others from the Long Family.

“Senior Duan!” A look of joy flashed across Long Yang’s face when he saw the man who had hurried over.

A tall, stern-looking man with a sword on his back stood in front of Long Yang and the others. He frowned solemnly at the scene that met his eyes.

“Senior Duan, save me!” Long Yang frantically crawled over and held on to the man’s leg like a drowning man clutching at straws.

A strange look flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes when she saw the man who had suddenly appeared.

This man was named Duan Xirui, and he was a powerful cultivator from the Eternal Dynasty. He was so talented and powerful that he was in the same league as the twelve saints. He was famous, and rumors said that he was upright and righteous. Who would have expected… this fellow to know the Long Family?

“Seniors, has there been some misunderstanding? Can you let them go for my sake?” Duan Xirui had arrived in the area that day and happened to hear the sound of fighting. He came to take a look because he had some connections with the Long Family Master.
