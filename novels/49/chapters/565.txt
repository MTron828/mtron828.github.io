Chapter 566 The Difficultly-Maintained Peace (2)

As such, the forces from both dynasties finally cleared the place together.

Apart from the sect forces, those family clans and itinerant cultivators were all chased away.

Meanwhile, ordinary sects like Wind Moon Sect and Qinglin Sect that were weaker than super sects still reserved the right to enter the mystic realm.

After all, this mystic realm no longer had an owner, and it had escaped the suppression of the sect’s heritage. As for how dangerous it was, no one could be sure, so leaving a few small sects here would help them to have a grasp.

Wind Moon Sect and Qinglin Sect were aware of those super sects’ thoughts but did not care about it.

Once they entered the mystic realm, everyone would try for all they are worth. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. Perhaps, the fiendcelestial beast would be obtained by them!

If they could obtain the fiendcelestial beast, small sects like Wind Moon Sect and Qinglin Sect could override super sects based on the combat ability of the fiendcelestial beast!

Although Yunxiao Sect’s sect protecting divine beast was extremely powerful and unparalleled, it paled in comparison with a fiendcelestial beast.

From afar, Ye Qingtang laughed coldly in her heart as she watched the sects conceive sinister motives.

Those sects forces were truly indulged in the wildest fantasy.

Not mentioning whether a fiendcelestial beast actually existed in the mystic realm, but if a fiendcelestial beast truly existed, did these people really think they could tame it easily given its combat ability?

They were simply making a fool out of themselves!

At Ye Qingtang’s peak in her past life, she was at the level of a Paragon and could easily destroy a dynasty with thousands of years of inheritance with the flick of a finger.

In her eyes, a Yin Yang True Lord was like an ant, and even powerful figures above the Yin Yang True Lord were required to give her a full bow and address her as ‘Paragon Senior’ when they saw Ye Qingtang.

Even so, Ye Qingtang still had to take a detour when she saw a fiendcelestial beast at her peak as there was no way she could enter a direct confrontation with it head-on. Yet, those super sects actually wishfully thought that they could tame a fiendcelestial beast? It was simply a fantasy where the ignorant had no fears.

“You!”

At that instant, a Yunxiao Sect inner sect disciple approached them speedily and sized up Ye Qingtang. “Which sect are you from!”

Although Ye Qingtang was listed in the Assassination Roll and her reward greatly surpassed the that of the number one person, the alluring teenage girl had transformed into a beautiful, young gentleman with a devilish charm after the disguise. As a result, the Yunxiao Sect disciple could not recognize her.

“I’m not in a sect or a clan. Just an itinerant,” Ye Qingtang said gently with a smile.

“Leave! Otherwise, you’ll be killed!”

After hearing that Ye Qingtang was an itinerant cultivator, the Yunxiao Sect disciple shouted sternly.

The place was already controlled by the forces of the two dynasties, and itinerant cultivators were not allowed to enter.

Before the Blood Moon Elder could reprimand, Ye Qingtang stopped him and smiled to the Yunxiao Sect disciple. “I’ll leave now.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Afterward, she turned around and left with the Blood Moon Elder.

“Holy Lady, why did you do that?” The Blood Moon Elder could not understand.

They could perfectly barge in forcefully. Should they leave so sullenly just because the forces of both dynasties controlled the area?

Ye Qingtang’s lips curled into a sinister smile. “This place is no longer suppressed by Xuanling Sect’s heritage and is already uncontrollable. It’s impossible for us to know how dangerous it is… Why not let those super sects explore and find a path for us then? By doing this, the risks would be greatly reduced.”

After hearing Ye Qingtang, the Blood Moon Elder’s eyes flickered as he applauded and praised.

“Ingenious. It’s really ingenious… Holy Lady, that’s truly a wise move!”
