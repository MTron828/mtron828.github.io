Chapter 1586 Black Witch 4

Black witches specialized in voodoo and black magic. They could curse someone near them without being detected. No one dared to speak out and say that they had any kind of contact with the black witch.The glamorous lady who had brought Ye Qingtang her food now clasped her hands before her chest in terror and unease. Her stark white face looked at the Bishop of York as she kneeled in panic.

“Beloved Bishop of York, the black witch tried to fool me into giving her food. I did not know who she was. Can I be saved? Has she put some evil black magic spell on me?” The woman was almost crying in fear.

“My poor child.” The Bishop of York looked at the woman’s heaving bosom, and his expression wavered. He put on a compassionate look. “Don’t worry, I have already burnt the black witch to death. You must return to the Vatican with me later. I will use Holy Water to exorcise the black magic curse, and you will be safe.”

“Thank you, Bishop of York!” The woman spoke with intense gratitude.

“Bishop of York, the black witch tried to kill me. Bishop, please save me!” When the burly man who had fought Ye Qingtang heard that he could be brought back to the Vatican and cleansed with holy water, he immediately rushed forward.

“...” The Bishop of York frowned slightly. With that, even more people kneeled and admitted that they had been harmed by the black witch.

The Bishop of York’s expression grew grimmer and grimmer.

The truth was that although there were many stories about black witches and various areas would frequently have stories of finding a black witch and putting her to death, most people only knew that black witches had a different hair and eye color. As that kind of pure black pigmentation was seldom seen in this mainland, its possessors were viewed as a foreign race, and it became proof of contact with the devil.

Unless a black witch really displayed her dark arts, there was no way to ascertain their identity. This over-generalization was merely to keep the people calm and to prevent any witch from escaping their grasp.

Now, everyone was pleading to receive cleansing with holy water.

Within the bar that was now engulfed in roaring flames, Ye Qingtang expressionlessly watched the blazing flames.

She did not know what a so-called black witch was in this world.

But she had no intention of being burnt to death by a bunch of stupid citizens.

Since the God of Nature had yet to issue her a mission, Ye Qingtang did not intend to waste time here.

With that, Ye Qingtang raised her hand slightly. A white halo suddenly flew from her hand and rushed at the surrounding flames. The next second, she picked up the little white tiger and lightly pushed off from the ground. She leaped up and rushed out of the flames encircling the bar!

The Bishop of York, who was still communicating God’s purpose to the people, suddenly heard an ear-splitting explosion.

He looked up in surprise and saw a huge halo rush out from the bar and float in mid-air.

A slender figure in the center of the white halo suddenly appeared in everyone’s line of sight.

The Bishop of York was completely stunned by what he saw.

The surrounding citizens were terrified when they saw that the black witch, who was supposedly burnt to death, had now rushed into the void and was suspended in mid-air without anything under her feet. Undulating screams immediately rang out. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Bishop of York, please save us. This black witch is too powerful!”

The Bishop of York was completely shocked. He stared stupidly at the young girl surrounded by the halo of light.
