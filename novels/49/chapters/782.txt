Chapter 783 Birth Mystery (3)

“Do you have any other things, Holy Lady?” The Blood Moon Elder asked.

“No. I still have to make a trip to the Bliss Forging Workshop.” Ye Qingtang replied.

“I’ll send you there then.” The Blood Moon Elder beamed.

Ye Qingtang did not say anything and directly left the Ouyang family clan with the Blood Moon Elder.

The Ouyang family clan’s housekeeper felt very complicated when he saw the “blooming spring” expression on his Young Miss’ face as she left the residence with the beautiful young man

Their Young Miss rejected many handsome and talented young men in the monarch city but was so solicitous to this fellow.

It can’t be that she really took a fancy on him and wants to marry him, can it?

Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder walked towards the Bliss Forging Workshop, but before long, they saw a grand troop in black moving past them.

The group of fully-armed soldiers was transporting a middle-aged man who was locked in a cage and parading ostentatiously about the town. The leader of the troop was the premier’s son, Qin Chen.

On a tall horse, Qin Chen swept his eyes across the crowd and suddenly caught sight of “Ouyang Qian”.

In this half a month, Qin Chen went to the Ouyang family clan several times to visit “Ouyang Qian” but was denied entrance.

The presents he brought over were accepted by “Ouyang Qian”, but he did not even manage to see her.

Then, Qin Chen ordered the troops to stop, and he hurried to “Ouyang Qian” directly.

“Qian.”

Hearing this call out of a sudden, the Blood Moon Elder, who was walking with Ye Qingtang, had goosebumps all over. He looked up and saw Qin Chen blocking his way with a face full of smiles. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“What?” The Blood Moon Elder looked at Qin Chen with a foul expression.

“Qian, what happened to you these days? Why are you always unwilling to meet me? If I wasn’t transporting the City Lord of Fuling City today, I would not meet you by coincidence.” Qin Chen was completely unbothered by the Blood Moon Elder’s dissatisfaction and stayed on shamelessly. The Blood Moon Elder was about to chase him away, but he suddenly heard the words “City Lord of Fuling City”. His eyes flickered, and he immediately looked at the middle-aged man in the jail wagon.

“City Lord of Fuling City? This person you’re transporting is Qu Xiangyang?”

“Yes,” Qin Chen said with a smile.

Then, the Blood Moon Elder turned around hurriedly and whispered to Ye Qingtang.

“Holy Lady, this Qu Xiangyan is that mysterious lady’s guard. He followed that lady for quite some time. Perhaps, he knows where that lady went.”

Ye Qingtang looked up at the resolute-looking Qu Xiangyang, who was detained in the jail wagon.

Qin Chen only noticed the Blood Moon Elder just now and did not see anyone else. Now that he saw the Blood Moon Elder whispering to the young man beside him all of a sudden, a trace of malice passed his eyes.

But when he saw the face of that young man, he was slightly stupefied.

A few days ago, the Dragon-Tiger General whined to his father that his son was killed. He mentioned that the murderer was a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord and sent that person’s portrait over afterward.

The person on that portrait was the beautiful young man who sent the Blood Moon Elder back to the Ouyang family clan that day!

His father ordered him to search for this person and find out whether there was a chance to rope him in, but Qin Chen did not see this person after several days of searching

Yet, unexpectedly…

He actually met the person here today.
