At that moment, Ye Qingtang finally realized that the man called Tian in that land of despair was not crazy nor was he bragging.

But of course, Ye Qingtang did not take that man’s words seriously at that time.

The man said that he could fulfill her wish and send her away. Ye Qingtang did not believe him. If he really had that ability, why did he not leave? Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Even at this moment, Ye Qingtang could not understand. She had indeed been sent away from that cursed place. Facts spoke louder than words. But why did that man… stay there?

This place… did not seem like the blessed paradise described by the big yellow dog.

Ye Qingtang heard the yellow dog mention that there were all kinds of legacy bloodlines in the blessed land. As long as one passed the test, one could obtain the legacy. And the place she was currently in seemed to be a complete world!

“What exactly happened… What went wrong?” Ye Qingtang pondered..
