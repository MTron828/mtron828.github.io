“Huh?” The Blood Moon Elder was slightly dazed. After returning to his senses, he hurriedly waved his hands and said, “Holy Lady… I don’t like women!”

“You don’t like women?” Ye Qingtang was stunned, and she could not help but size up the Blood Moon Elder with a subtle expression.

“No no no…” The Blood Moon Elder felt his scalp tingle from Ye Qingtang’s stare and frantically shook his head. “That’s not what I mean. I just don’t lust after women…”

Ye Qingtang looked at the Blood Moon Elder speechlessly and pinched her glabella.

Was he mistaken about something?

As the Blood Moon Elder looked at the enchantingly beautiful Ouyang Qian, he was filled with grief and indignation. Before entering the mystic realm, the Holy Lady told him that she would bestow him a big present…

Initially, the Blood Moon Elder was filled with expectation for this so-called “big present” and assumed that it would be an elixir that she refined. However, never would he expect that the supposed big present was actually a woman!!

What would he need a woman for?!

What he needed were elixirs!

Elixirs!

“He… is a man?!” After she heard the conversation between Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder, Ouyang Qian’s expression changed drastically. She stared at the Blood Moon Elder in disbelief with horror in her eyes before looking at Ye Qingtang. “You… You actually want to let such a hideous looking man engage in that elicit act… with me?!”

“Pfft!” The Blood Moon Elder shot a look at Ouyang Qian. “Shameless.”

To think that he was once so honorable as an Elder of the Blood Moon Sect a thousand years ago. How would he want such a woman like Ouyang Qian!

Before waiting for Ye Qingtang to say anything, the Blood Moon Elder immediately inched nearer to hear and smiled. “Holy Lady, how about you exchange this woman with elixirs… I personally like elixirs more… Look…”

However, Ye Qingtang shook her head, looked at the Blood Moon Elder, and spoke in a grave tone with sincerity. “The effect of this woman is much better than elixirs.”

Seeing that his Holy Lady simply did not give him any room for negotiation, the Blood Moon Elder had a sullen expression as he said, “Holy Lady, you may not know, but my waist cannot make it…”

“…” Ye Qingtang stared blankly at the Bloom Moon Elder. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Ye Qingtang was actually speechless for a moment. This Blood Moon Elder was overthinking too much.

Furthermore…

How much did he despise Ouyang Qian exactly?!

“You should change a body already,” Ye Qingtang said helplessly while looking at the Blood Moon Elder.

“Wh… What?!”

The Blood Moon Elder was dumbstruck and in utter disbelief.

Ye Qingtang’s intention was actually for him to possess this woman’s body!

Almost right when he realized that, the Blood Moon Elder turned around and wanted to leave without hesitation.

Yet, how would he have the chance to leave…

Ye Qingtang raised a brow and grabbed the Blood Moon Elder’s left shoulder directly, pulling him

“Why? You don’t like it?” Ye Qingtang looked at the Blood Moon Elder with a raised brow.

At that moment, shock filled the Blood Moon Elder’s face while misery flooded his eyes. “Holy Lady, I’m a man!”

A thousand years ago, he overran the world and could go anywhere he pleased. Many supreme-grade women adored him. Yet, he was to be a woman now?!!

If others knew about this, wouldn’t they laugh their heads off!

He simply could not do it!

“You’ve been a man for a thousand years. What’s so bad about being a woman occasionally?” Ye Qingtang spoke meaningfully with a sincere expression.

At that very instant, Ouyang Qian’s face was already ash-white.
