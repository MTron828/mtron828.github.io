1212 The Final Battle 4

The golden sword was extremely fast. So fast that it was invisible to the naked eye.

Puff!

In the void, Ye Qingtang turned pale. A mouthful of hot blood spurted from her mouth.

The sword that was formed by the accumulation of Heavenly Venerate power swiftly pierced Ye Qingtang’s right shoulder.

“Oh… my aim is off.” The white-robed old man laughed softly when he saw what had happened. The next instant, he smiled slightly. “You won’t be so lucky this time…”

As he spoke, the golden sword appeared again, and this time, it was aimed directly at Ye Qingtang’s vitals.

Swoosh!

A piercing sound could be heard throughout the entire area, causing a strong wind to blow.

When she saw that, Ye Qingtang turned pale and immediately took out the Mirror of Illusions.

Buzz!

The Mirror of Illusions turned rapidly. The moment the golden sword was illuminated by the Mirror of Illusions, it was transformed into a few pieces of wood and fell from the void.

“Mirror of Illusions…”

When he saw that, the white-robed old man was shocked. This girl actually had a treasure like the Mirror of Illusions?!

“Ah, based on your abilities, you can only use a treasure like that once… What are you going to do this time?”

The old man laughed coldly. He quickly raised his right hand, and another golden sword formed from the accumulation of Heavenly Venerate power appeared. It swiftly struck at Ye Qingtang’s vitals.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang was standing in the same spot, frowning deeply.

The golden long sword was very fast—so fast that she could barely see it clearly…

Just as the white-robed old man said, as Ye Qingtang cultivation level was that of a Yin Yang Perfected Lord, she could only use a treasure like the Mirror of Illusions once. She needed to wait a certain period of time before she could use it again.

A perilous aura enclosed Ye Qingtang within the span of two breaths. The golden sword was mere inches away from her.

Ye Qingtang almost reflexively shifted left.

Swoosh!

With a piercing sound, the golden sword swung past and pierced a mountain peak in the distance.

“Ahah, you’re pretty lucky… your natural reflexes saved you… Looks like you’ve often danced with death. For a girl, that’s quite unusual.” The white-robed old man laughed softly.

Ye Qingtang frowned deeply, then turned, and fled.

A thousand miles away was a valley formed by two gorges. If she could just get there, she could vanish from the white-robed old man’s line of sight.

When she thought of that, Ye Qingtang used all her might and increased her speed to its limit.

Eight hundred miles…

Five hundred miles…

Two hundred miles…

The gorge in front was just meters away.

But at that moment.

Whiz!

A frightening sound pierced the air.

Puff!

A golden sword swiftly pierced Ye Qingtang’s body from behind.

Ye Qingtang instantly turned pale. Copious amounts of blood seeped from her mouth, and she fell from the void.

But her hands still gripped little You Yun and little Luo Xue tightly. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

At that moment, the little white tiger poked its head out of Ye Qingtang’s robes. It smelled the strong scent of blood that lingered. Its snow-white fur was already covered with Ye Qingtang’s blood.

The little white tiger was shocked to see Ye Qingtang’s tightly closed eyes.

But before the little white tiger could move, Ye Qingtang opened her eyes again. Her brow was deeply furrowed. She forced down the blood that was rushing up her throat and swiftly passed through the gorge to enter an immense mountain range.

“Humph. You’re about to die, and you’re still struggling.” The white-robed old man grunted coldly. He stepped through the void in the direction that Ye Qingtang had fled towards.
