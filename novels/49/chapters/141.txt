Chapter 142: Rewards Pavilion (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Zhou Qu had been in a terribly foul mood these few days. After losing four bottles of Xi Spirit Pills to Ye Qingtang in front of everyone, he was ridiculed by quite a few senior and junior brothers.

In the many years that he set up the arena, it was still Zhou Qu’s first time losing big time to a new disciple.

Losing four bottles of Xi Spirit Pills at once plus the bottle he gave Lu Xiuwen, he barely profited from the new disciples this year. How were the additional two to three bottles enough for him to make it through this year?

Zhou Qu knew that his natural endowment was not outstanding enough; thus, he squeezed his brain juice to use dishonest means and obtain Xi Spirit Pills in order to support himself in ranking in the first thousand in the outer sect.

However, he did not expect to meet such a cursed Ye Qingtang this year who messed up all his plans.

Helpless, Zhou Qu could only head to the Rewards Pavilion in search of suitable missions for him to exchange for a few bottles of Xi Spirit Pills in order to obtain enough spirit pills to support his cultivation.

However…

Never in a million years would Zhou Qu expect that the moment he stepped into the Rewards Pavilion, he would actually see Ye Qingtang!

All the grievance from these few days flooded his mind immediately, and a dangerous look flashed across his eyes.

“What a coincidence, Junior Sister Ye. I didn’t expect to run into you here.”

Ye Qingtang heard this and turned around immediately. Looking up, she saw that a devious-looking Zhou Qu had already stood behind her.

“Senior Brother Zhou,” Ye Qingtang addressed generously.

Zhou Qu clenched his teeth secretly and was even more annoyed when he looked at an unafraid Ye Qingtang. If it were not for Ye Qingtang, how would he have lost so many Xi Spirit Pills? How would he, then, be here to search for missions!

A plan suddenly formed in his mind, and he laughed while looking at Ye Qingtang,

“Good thing you’re here, Junior Sister Ye. I was going to look for you just now.”

“You’re looking for me?” Ye Qingtang raised her brows and continued. “Is there anything you need me for?”

Zhou Qu laughed. “Of course, there is a reason why I wanted to look for you. You performed pretty well on the arena a few days ago, and I am very grateful. However, Junior Sister Ye seemed to forget something; thus, I am here to remind you.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Oh? What did I forget?” Ye Qingtang looked at Zhou Qu calmly.

A sharp, cold light shone across Zhou Qu’s eyes though he wore a solemn expression.

“I started the arena that day to be able to learn from fellow disciples and allowed new disciples like you all to participate since you all were interested. However… I personally guided you so painstakingly. Did you forget that you should give me some remuneration?”

Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes.

She was aware that Zhou Qu was narrow-minded but did not think that…

She had seen a shameless person before but had never seen such a shameless person.

Zhou Qu was not resigned to the fact that she won the Xi Spirit Pills and actually thought of such an excuse to get some back!

“Remuneration? I don’t remember senior brother saying about any remuneration,” Ye Qingtang said calmly.

Suddenly, Zhou Qu’s face darkened, and the smile on his face slowly faded. He scoffed, “Junior Sister Ye, you just entered our sect and may still be unclear of the sect’s rules. When an old disciple gives guidance to a new disciple, remuneration is required. It is still so even if this were to travel into the ears of the wardens.”
