Chapter 868 Aren’t You Scared?

“My ring? What ring?” Ye Qingtang did not know what he was talking about, and her face was filled with confusion.

“Of course, I’m referring to the ring on your finger,” Ling Yan said.

Ye Qingtang sized up her fingers instinctively as she heard Ling Yan’s words.

There was only one ring on her finger, which was given by Han Cangming, the Palace Lord of the Antiquity Palace.

However, how would Ling Yan know the name of the ring… and the ring could even kill his teacher?

“You know about this ring?” Ye Qingtang was shocked.

“Of course,” Ling Yan said.

“Wait… You know about Han Cangming?” Ye Qingtang frowned and asked.

“Han Cangming…” Ling Yan was silent for a while at the other end of the Supreme Token.

“Han Cangming… I almost forgot about this name…”

There was no clear reply from Ling Yan.

“How did you know about this ring?” Ye Qingtang asked confusedly.

After a long while, Ling Yan’s voice came out from the voice transmission stone again. “Of course. The ring belonged to me.”

“What did you say?!” Ye Qingtang could not believe what she just heard.

However, before Ye Qingtang could say anything else, Ling Yan interrupted. “Miss Ye, I was just joking… But remember, the ring is powerful, and you can only use it once only.”

After Ling Yan finished his words, there was no more sound coming out of the Supreme Token no matter how Ye Qingtang tried to ask or call him.

She did not fall asleep for the entire night, and the next day arrived.

Gu Tianhe, Feng Wudang, and Li Bingxue came to find Ye Qingtang.

The area they were at was considered a dead vein. They needed to go deeper for more exposure.

“Junior Brothers and Junior Sister… I think we should go our separate ways from now onward.”

Before the three of them said anything, Ye Qingtang first spoke.

After hearing Ye Qingtang’s words, the three of them were stunned slightly. Why was that necessary when nothing had happened?

“Senior Sister Ye, are you leaving?” Li Bingxue held Ye Qingtang’s arm and asked.

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang nodded. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Senior Sister Ye, why is that so? Did we do anything wrong?” Feng Wudang asked confusedly.

“It’s not related to you. It’s just that… my enemy is going to kill me anytime. I don’t want to drag you into that.” Ye Qingtang sighed and said.

“Enemy… who is that?!” Gu Tianhe said coldly.

“Perfected Gu Yun…” Ye Qingtang said.

“

“Perfected Gu Yun? Isn’t he the teacher of the Eternal Dynasty Ling Yan? He’s just Ling Yan’s servant.” Feng Wudang scoffed and said.

“Don’t be afraid, Senior Sister Ye! The Supreme Academy is at the complete opposite end with Ling Yan. We are loyal to the elder prince only. If the Perfected Gu Yun wants to kill you, he’s committing suicide!” Li Bingxue said.

“That’s right. If we kill the Perfected Gu Yun, we will get an award when we return to the Supreme Academy!” Feng Wudang nodded and said.

Not many people knew that the Perfected Gu Yun actually sided with the elder prince. He was still Ling Yan’s person on the surface. Students of the Supreme Academy would definitely not know the complicated relations in between.

Ye Qingtang was speechless as the three of them were eager to fight the Perfected Gu Yun. Now, she understood the reason why Ling Yan was so sure that the three people would agree to fight against Perfected Gu Yun.

If they met Perfected Gu Yun, they would fight him with all their strength even if Ye Qingtang was not around. Once the Perfected Gu Yun died in their hands… they would definitely be rewarded after they returned to the Supreme Academy!

“Perfected Gu Yun was at the Divine Arcane Supremacy. Aren’t you scared?” Ye Qingtang said.
