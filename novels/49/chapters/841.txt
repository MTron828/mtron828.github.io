Chapter 842 Predestined

Ye Qingtang sized up Ling Yan’s karmic natal chart. Just like a chess game, the first half of his fate was already predestined, but the latter half of the natal chart was vague.

“What does it mean?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“The first half of my natal chart is what I have done in my life and cannot be changed, while the latter half is so vague because I have not sowed any cause. Thus, there’s no way of having an effect… Destiny is held in one’s hands. Even if the heavens want to predestine someone’s life, it will merely guide him to do some things… For example, if the heavens want you to die, it will definitely lead you to lay some foundations like suiciding out of sorrow and grief. These sorrowful events are the cause, and your suicide is the effect. One would never die for no reason. Destiny is about causality. If the heavens want you to go insane, it will definitely cause you to swell with emotions. In that case, swelling is the cause, and insanity is the effect.” Ling Yan smiled.

Ye Qingtang was not clear and did not really understand what karma was.

“In other words, the heavens are unable to predestine a person’s life and will only lead you to do some things to achieve the destiny that the heavens want to. It’s like your destiny is to be slaughtered by a powerful figure eventually, so the heavens would definitely lead you to do things that will anger the powerful figure. Thus, destiny is actually held in your own hands.”

“This is why the karmic natal chart for the rest of your life is so vague and empty?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“That’s right. I have not done anything in the latter half of my life; thus, the natal chart is so empty.” Ling Yan replied with a smile.

Although Ye Qingtang still could not understand, she roughly understood the general idea.

“But what made me curious is your natal chart.”

Then, Ling Yan waved his arm, and another illusory karmic natal chart appeared before Ye Qingtang once again.

“This natal chart…” Ye Qingtang inspected the illusory natal chart. The karmic destiny on it was already arranged in order like an old person who had finished living his life.

“It’s your natal chart,” Ling Yan said.

“Mine?!” A trace of surprise emerged in Ye Qingtang’s eyes immediately.

Going by what Ling Yan said, how could her karmic natal chart already be predestined?!

“Look at your natal chart. How miserable.” Ling Yan chuckled and subsequently faded that karmic natal chart away.

“It’s said that Ling Yan’s intelligence is like that of a demon. You can predict all sorts of details just from a few pieces of information of one’s karma. Admirable.” Ye Qingtang looked at Ling Yan and said.

Ling Yan’s expression remained the same. “So you’re admitting that you are reborn.”

“However, I still don’t know what you’re talking about,” Ye Qingtang said.

“In this world, fighting with Emperor-level figures and true gods… is no better than fighting with the heavens. The outcome of your natal chart is already predestined. If I can change your destiny… Doesn’t it prove that I am more powerful than it?” Ling Yan pointed to the sky as he spoke.

“This person…” Ye Qingtang looked at Ling Yan. He was simply a complete lunatic. His ambitions were so frightening, and he actually wants to fight with the heavens?!

“How about bringing me to the Dragon Vein?” Ling Yan asked. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Although this place is the entrance to the Dragon Vein, there is a Diamond Boulder below,” Ye Qingtang said.

“You can destroy it then.” Ling Yan smiled.

“Even an Arcane Supremacy cannot break it. How can I be able to?” Ye Qingtang shook her head, instinctively wanting to stay further away from this man.
