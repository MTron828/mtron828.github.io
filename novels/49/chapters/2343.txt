Chapter 2344: Swollen Face (1)

Ye Qing’s reputation in the Netherworld Academy would be ruined. Like this, his students would also be implicated in the rumors and be dragged through the mud.

The only way to deal with this was with genuine power. This was the only way to quash those rumors.

Yun Chen could more or less guess that was what Ye Qing was thinking. It was just that he was not sure whether Ye Qing was really that confident.

Qiu Nan looked rather conflicted. In the end, they had just got to know Ye Qing yesterday and were not that close to him. But they all respected his courage and willingness to stand up for himself.

Perhaps Lei Yan and the others didn’t realize this themselves, but they had completely changed.

It was not just their powers, but also their hearts.

Previously, they had already given up on themselves in despair. Thanks to Ye Qing’s existence in their lives, they had stepped onto the road to becoming stronger. Both their powers and their aspirations had undergone earth-shattering changes.

A phrase popped into Qiu Nan’s mind.

Troops took after their general.

Perhaps it was this kind of feeling. Ye Qing was not just their teacher, he was their spiritual leader. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Qiu Nan couldn’t help feeling somewhat envious. He had his own teacher but they didn’t have this type of deep bond. If he encountered trouble, would his teacher fight for him? And if his own teacher was in trouble, would he also be as brave as Lei Yan and the rest, willing to sacrifice everything to help him?

What kind of shared experience forged this kind of bond?

On the platform, Ye Qingtang looked as calm as always. Meanwhile, Di Nuo had a grin as deep as it was malevolent.

Meanwhile, Ye Qingtang looked at Di Nuo steadily. She knew he disliked her. This was the kind of scorn an arrogant practitioner had for a weaker one.

Perhaps she had already aroused Di Nuo’s dislike the moment she became a teacher in the Netherworld Academy.

But…

So what?

Having been reborn, there was no way Ye Qingtang would bother about the baseless opinions of others. She was doing this now just so Lei Yan and the others wouldn’t have their own names dragged through the mud.

There was no way she could leave them with a tarnished reputation of having had a morally corrupt teacher, right? And they had been so protective of this “morally corrupt” Boss.

Like this, Ye Qingtang would gladly enter into battle for the sake of her brats.

Di Nuo gazed at Ye Qing. Right from the start, he felt that Ye Qing was just asking for it.

A Paragon Sixth Heaven level practitioner dared to stand on the same platform as him?

“Ye Qing, I will give you one last chance. If you admit your wrongdoings now, I will spare you the physical pain.” Di Nuo smiled.

Ye Qingtang completely ignored his words.

Di Nuo’s face darkened.

“Well then, you will only have yourself to blame for what happens today. Anything can happen in a fight, don’t blame me if there are any accidents.”

The threat in Di Nuo’s voice was clear.

“Di Nuo! If you dare to hurt my Boss, I will kill you even if I have to go down into hell with you!” Lei Yan hollered.

They respected Ye Qing’s decision but this didn’t mean they would forgive those who hurt him.

As Di Nuo glanced at Lei Yan and the others, the amusement in his eyes deepened.

“Ye Qing, I do admire you for this. You managed to make these teenagers trust you so completely. What kind of potion did you give them? Why are they so loyal to you?”
