Chapter 1314 Impeachment 1

Such incidents were actually of no great importance, but no one expected Lord Hu to present it as a memorial to his Majesty during a court session! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Now there was no way to resolve the matter!

Ye Qingtang was standing on the sidelines, and her lips twitched involuntarily as she watched the scene unfold.

What kind of fiancée had the Eternal Emperor selected for Ling Yan? What she had done?

Based on the plan, locking Mo Yunxian and the others up in the Board of Punishments would show that Ling Yan was guilty of mismanaging his subordinates. He would, at most, be accused of indulging his subordinates and allowing them to behave willfully.

But Mo Yunxian had meddled and gotten them released.

Now, it was even better.

Now, Ling Yan would probably be accused of corruption, contempt of imperial authority, abuse of power, and colluding with his adherents.

As the Crown Prince’s fiancée, she was so proud that she dared to throw her weight around in the Board of Punishments and meddle with their affairs!

Ye Qingtang felt that Mo Yunxian had really brought misfortune to Ling Yan.

She did not love him. She clearly was against him.

For a moment, Ye Qingtang silently mourned for Ling Yan in her heart.

Sure enough, the Eternal Emperor’s expression immediately darkened.

In the end, the Crown Prince was only the Crown Prince. If he overstepped his boundaries, he would be seeking his own death.

No monarch would allow his own children to interfere with the workings of the government.

“Send men to immediately bring them before me!” The Eternal Emperor said coldly.

With that, a troop of guards left the palace to arrest Mo You and the others.

“What else do you have to report?” The Eternal Emperor looked at Lord Hu again.

Lord Hu continued. “I also want to impeach the Crown Prince on grounds of falsifying his achievements, deceiving the throne, and appropriating the disaster relief funds!”

Lord Hu threw another bomb.

As he spoke, Lord Hu presented another memorial.

When Ye Qingtang saw him hand over the memorial, she knew what it contained.

She did not need to read it to know that the memorial involved Ling Yan’s past disaster relief work at the border. However, the achievements of the past had now been rewritten as an appropriation of funds, indifference to the citizens affected by the natural disaster, and falsifying information to fabricate achievements in order to deceive the Emperor.

Why did she know all this so well?

Because she had dictated it to the Eldest Prince, word for word.

One might say that Ye Qingtang had written that memorial.

Ye Qingtang could not help but feel guilty. She secretly glanced at Ling Yan, only to see that he did not appear to have heard anything. He was still standing calmly in the court as if he was not the one being impeached.

Was he relaxed?

Or prepared?

One must know that Ye Qingtang had dealt two vicious blows. If Ling Yan had no way to counter them, he might lose his position as a prince, not to mention his position as Crown Prince.

Sure enough, Ye Qingtang colorful memorial hit the Eternal Emperor in a vital spot. His expression grew extremely grim.

Lord Hu was unsparing in his efforts. He recited the contents of the memorial in front of everyone.

The court was abuzz.

One must know that a few years ago, Ling Yan had won much praise from the ministers for his disaster relief work at the borders.

If all this was merely for show, then the praise would instantly be transformed, and amplified, into abhorrence.

“Lord Hu, is there any misunderstanding? The Crown Prince does not seem like an avaricious person.” The Eldest Prince made a show of disbelief.
