It was completely impossible.

The Deity Ocean seemed to possess a tremendous power. Ye Qingtang had just put it in and already felt like her space ring was going to explode! She was so shocked that she quickly took out the Deity Ocean. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Faced with this situation, Ye Qingtang was feeling very distressed..

“You are a rather clever little ant. You knew to immediately transfer the item away. Luckily I have already memorized the Deity Ocean’s scent.

Just as Ye Qingtang was feeling extremely desperate, a cold voice suddenly sounded from somewhere behind her.

Ye Qingtang turned and saw the grim face of the Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General. He was standing nearby, his malevolent eyes narrowed and staring straight at the Deity Ocean in her hands.

Sh*t! She had been discovered so quickly. And by the Great General of the Heavenly Demon Race!

In the blink of an eye, Ye Qingtang flew away with the Deity Ocean in hand.

If she had known that Hu had stolen the Deity Ocean, she would never have sneaked a peek!

Ye Qingtang used all her power to flee as fast as she could. But no matter how fast she flew, she was no match for the Great General of the Heavenly Demon Race.

In just a few breaths, the Great General of the Heavenly Demon Race landed right in front of Ye Qingtang, and Ye Qingtang was forced into an emergency stop

Beads of cold sweat dripped down from Ye Qingtang’s forehead.

The Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General appeared emotionless. He was staring at the Deity Ocean and could clearly feel that Ye Qingtang’s powers were far below his.

“Hand me the Deity Ocean. It’s not something that should be touched by trash like you,” The Great General of the Heavenly Demon Race stated coldly.

Ye Qingtang’s back was already drenched in cold sweat. Her heart was pounding heavily as she stared at the Great General.

Trash? She never wanted to touch this stupid Deity Ocean in the first place!

Although she was offended by the Great General’s disdainful words, Ye Qingtang still had some common sense. She did not want to throw her own life away just for this Deity Ocean. Anyway, she was no match at all for this Great General.

Ye Qingtang immediately handed the Deity Ocean over. She said respectfully, “I have heard many stories about your great powers and have admired you since a long time ago. You are naturally the only one who is worthy enough to own this Deity Ocean.”

“Humph.” The Great General of the Heavenly Demon Race snorted in contempt, oblivious toward Ye Qingtang’s praises. He only had eyes for the Deity Ocean. Everything else was insignificant.

“Good that you have some common sense. Give me the Deity Ocean and I will let you die in one piece,” the Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General stated arrogantly. It was as if letting her die in one piece was already very magnanimous of him.

Sh*t! I am already handing this thing to you. Why do you still have to kill me?!

As Ye Qingtang cursed the Great General on the inside, she shifted her gaze to the side, all prepared to throw the Deity Ocean far away in order to divert the Great General’s attention, so that she had a chance to escape.

She believed that compared to killing her, the Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General would be more interested in getting the Deity Ocean.

Meanwhile, Ye Qingtang was more interested in staying alive. She didn’t care about the Deity Ocean at all. She would leave it to the fiendish demons to fight over it.

Just as Ye Qingtang was raising her hand to toss it away, the Deity Ocean suddenly glowed very intensely. A dazzling beam of light shot right out of the Deity Ocean and created a large chasm in mid-air, from which a powerful magnetic force could be felt.
