Ye Qingtang wanted to return to her room and get a change of clothes but ended up being dragged away by Qin Huan and the rest…

“Congratulations for today, Junior Sister Ye! I’ll play the host tonight and treat you to a good meal!” Qin Huan hit his chest generously.

“Senior Brother Qin, this is not a place to treat one to a meal.” Ye Qingtang looked at the Xuanming Pavilion before her and cast Qin Huan a speechless look.

“Treat treat treat, I will definitely treat you. However, you obtained the number one position in the inner sect assessment this year. According to the rules, you can exchange for a treasure below fifty thousand Xuanming points in the Xuanming Pavilion,” Qin Huan grinned and said. “Junior Sister Ye, I usually spend all my Xuanming points on elixirs and have never really seen the treasures in Xuanming Pavilion. So… let me share some of your spotlight and accompany you to select an item. How about that?”

“…” The corners of Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched slightly.

She was wondering when Qin Huan had been so kind to be this anxious to give a treat, but it turned out that this was waiting for her.

Gu Yanqiu from aside could not help but let out a laugh. He was aware of Qin Huan’s plan, but he wanted to congratulate Ye Qingtang as well, so he came along.

Ye Qingtang was a little helpless. However, her reward would have to be claimed sooner or later. Since Qin Huan and the rest wanted to take a look, so shall it be.

Immediately, Ye Qingtang entered the Xuanming Pavilion ahead of everyone.

There were many disciples selecting items to exchange for in the Xuanming Pavilion.

“Isn’t that… Ye Qingtang?” A disciple suddenly saw Ye Qingtang, who walked into the Xuanming Pavilion, and his eyes popped.

“Ye Qingtang? Which Ye Qingtang are you talking about?” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Who else can it be! It is really your loss to not watch the inner sect assessment today. You don’t know that this Ye Qingtang won the number one position on the Excellence Roll just a while ago.”

“Is that real? But didn’t I hear that Ye Qingtang is a red spirit root previously? Didn’t she just enter the outer sect this year?”

“She is indeed a red spirit root, but so what? You didn’t see her skills when she was sparring with Senior Brother Ji on the ring today. It was simply amazing! I heard that she could participate in the assessment this time because she spent thirty thousand Xuanming points to exchange for the qualification.”

“Since she is the first, won’t she be able to choose any treasure within the price range in Xuanming Pavilion now?”

The attention of all the disciples was attracted by Ye Qingtang’s news, and everyone’s eyes fell on her uniformly.

Looking at the back view of that thin frame, it was difficult for them to connect her with the number one on the Excellence Roll.

“What… kind of reward do you think Ye Qingtang will choose?”

“This is not easy to say. There are so many treasures in Xuanming Pavilion, and it’s a difficult problem for anyone.”

“What so hard about it! Give me a random item, and I’ll still want it!”

“Dream on! Do you think you are Ye Qingtang!”

As the people discussed, Ye Qingtang and the rest had already arrived at the counter to exchange weapons.

The warden behind the counter was the same person who showed Ye Qingtang all types of weapons the other day. He found it strange after Ye Qingtang left without choosing anything that day and only realized afterward that Ye Qingtang’s Xuanming points had already been used to exchange for the inner sect assessment qualification.

Now that he saw Ye Qingtang in the Xuanming Pavilion again, that warden was no longer as excited as before. After all, the huge sum of Xuanming points in Ye Qingtang’s hands were already all spent, and there was nothing he could squeeze from her.
