Chapter 529 What is a Sect (5)

The leaders of the two sects did not move at all.

The Grand Elder and the Sect Master stared at the divine beast of Yunxiao Sect constantly. If they took a move first and did not manage to stop the divine beast, the consequences would be unimaginable.

The Xuanling Sect Master gritted his teeth. It was not that they did not want to attack… they could not!

The Sect Master’s eyes were red as he saw those who died during the fight. He bowed to them, and that was the only thing he could do now. He felt so helpless and blamed himself constantly.

The fight between the two sects could be compared to the ones among the dynasty. He could not do things based on his feelings He could only bear with them no matter how painful they were.

Feng Moli’s body flew and was knocked onto a rock at one of the corners in the sect.

Feng Moli slowly got up in the debris. Blood spilled out of his mouth.

He was the renowned tyrant in the inner sect, but now, he was using his life to fight and to guard the sect.

One Yunxiao Sect disciple who dressed in a white robe walked towards Feng Moli. His eyes were indifferent, and he held a yellow-grade weapon.

“The Paragon Skill… is strong. You could use it to block three hundred of my moves, and it even killed my Senior Brother,” the man said softly.

Feng Moli gnashed his teeth.

Swoosh!

The man chopped his sword down at Feng Moli.

A cyan sword glint appeared suddenly and hit the Yunxiao Sect disciple. He flew away under the force.

“Moli, are you alright!”

Zhu Changge went forward and helped Feng Moli to get up. “Thank you…” Feng Moli said.

“You should thank the black-grade spirit weapon in my hand.” Zhu Changge smiled.

Feng Moli sized the cyan sword up, and the sword released terrifying force.

There were ten black-grade spirit weapons in the Treasure Pavilion. The one in Zhu Changge’s hand was one of them.

“How dare you!”

The disciple who was hit by the sword aura opened his eyes wide in rage and shouted.

Swoosh! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Two Xuanling Sect inner sect disciples took a leap and landed.

There was one man and one woman. Both of them held black-grade divine weapons. The sword was pure black, and the knife was pure red.

The knife and the sword chopped down at the same time and released dazzling luster. The forces combined and produced a super strong attack.

Boom!

The Yunxiao Sect disciple exploded into pieces under the force before he realized what was going on.

“Sun Scorching Knife and the Moon Ice Sword… so powerful…”

Feng Moli was totally shocked.

The one holding the Sun Scorching Knife was the current top disciple of Xuanling Sect, Han Qingyun. The woman was one of the core disciples, Su Xin.

“The Sun Scorching Knife and the Moon Ice Sword are the strongest black-grade weapons in our sect. We could show the greatest power of the two weapons all because of our love,” Han Qingyun said softly.

Su Xin’s face was slightly red.

“Only people whose hearts are connected can show the greatest power of the Sun Scorching Knife and the Moon Ice Sword. Senior Brother, Senior Sister Su Xin’s and your abilities are able to use the weapons completely and pose threats to the elders of the Yunxiao Sect…” Zhu Changge said.

Han Qingyun was the top disciple of Xuanling Sect this year. His ability was comparable to that of Xuanling Sect elders. Su Xin’s ability was slightly lower but not by a big difference. When the two of them combined their powers with the Yin Yang weapons, the Yunxiao Sect disciples had no other ways besides death as they did not possess any treasures and only their own cultivation skills.
