1582 Two Star Constellation 4

Amidst the shouting and scolding, Ye Qingtang could vaguely discern that the country she was in was called the Supreme League Kingdom. It was the most ambitious country on the mainland, and it had the greatest military strength compared to others. The knights of this kingdom had made incursions in every neighboring country and conquered much land. Any hostility was crushed to dust between the steel hooves of the Supreme League Kingdom’s calvary.

As the Supreme League Kingdom expanded continually, another two countries, which were similarly ambitious, sheltered under the Supreme League Kingdom’s wings and began a battle to dominate the world.

But this battle against the rest of the world was at an impasse. A few powerful countries that had taken a neutral stance at first had become displeased by the Supreme League Kingdom’s invasions and ordered punitive expeditions against the Supreme League Kingdom.

Ye Qingtang quickly absorbed this information. Who knew what kind of mission that awful God of Nature would give her? She glanced around, wondering what the God of Nature was doing.

Ye Qingtang was rendered speechless by what she saw.

Only she could see that the God of Nature had mixed in with the crowd and was dancing a strange dance with the curvaceous lady and the burly men.

Does that mean that... he just wanted to seize the opportunity to enter the various worlds and have some fun?

Ye Qingtang was just feeling helpless when the curvaceous lady placed a plate of beef that was still oozing blood before her. She also gave her a blunt knife and a fork with broken tines.

Ye Qingtang felt perplexed when she looked at the two utensils.

Are there no chopsticks?

Ye Qingtang looked helpless. She was about to throw the beef that was oozing with blood into the little white tiger’s mouth when there was a sudden disturbance at the bar. A few well-built men, with their faces reddened with alcohol, had started brawling. The entire place was in chaos, and various utensils were sent flying. The shrill screams of a woman mingled with the shouts of the men.

Although Ye Qingtang was sitting in a corner, she saw a burly man flying straight at her. She subconsciously raised her hand and caught the burly man, then placed him on the ground.

The burly man seemed to be drunk. The moment he landed on the ground, he turned and tried to punch Ye Qingtang’s head.

A group of busybodies saw that he had suddenly swung at the petite young lady, and they roared in excitement.

“...” Ye Qingtang’s expression did not change when she saw that this ungrateful man had swung his fist at her. She single-handedly caught the burly man’s fist.

The soft, pale little hand seized the fist that was even larger than her head. As the burly man realized that his fist would not budge, a look of agony appeared on his large, hairy face.

“Get lost,” Ye Qingtang said coldly. Then, she lifted her hand slightly and flung him aside.

The burly man fell with a crash, splintering the table and chairs and causing the crowd to roar with laughter. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Charlie, your muscles are like cotton wool. What a joke. You can’t even manage a little fellow.”

The burly man who had been flung aside was irritated and angry. He roared with rage and flung a huge beer barrel at Ye Qingtang.

Will there be any end to this?

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly. She had nothing to say about the actions of this barbarian. She picked up the little white tiger, and with a leap, her petite figure vanished before everyone’s eyes. When she next appeared, she was standing behind the burly man. Her soft, pale little hand grasped the burly man’s neck. Then, she smashed his huge body onto the ground.
