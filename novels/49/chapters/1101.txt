Chapter 1102 Eye Of Extermination (1)

However, at that moment, Ye Qingtang’s body suddenly burst into crimson flames. Within the span of two breaths, Ye Qingtang had used the power of the Divine Phoenix’s bloodline to completely transform into a towering ball of fire.

The golden-robed man looked somewhat perplexed. He looked at the ball of roaring flames, unable to recover his wits.

At that moment, two other powerful cultivators from the ancient clan looked shocked. It was clear that the golden-robed middle-aged man had fallen into this girl’s trap.

Ye Qingtang had the Divine Phoenix’s bloodline and understood its Ultimate Origin Skill. These two forces had been perfectly integrated in Ye Qingtang’s body and could transform into a pure manifestation of power. This destructive flame was a type of pure manifestation of power and was imbued with a huge destructive force. Considering the golden-robed middle-aged man’s abilities, he was so near to Ye Qingtang that he would certainly die if he was surrounded and burned by the pure fire that Ye Qingtang had transformed into.

However, just as the expressions of these two powerful cultivators of the ancient clan changed…

After Ye Qingtang transformed into pure flames, the golden-robed middle-aged man did not have time to react before his entire body was consumed by the flames. His entire person was instantly burned into ashes. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Having pulled off her move smoothly, the towering pure flames concentrated at one point again and transformed into Ye Qingtang’s actual self.

The other two powerful cultivators of the ancient tribe tried to rescue him, but it was too late. They had not been prepared for Ye Qingtang to transform into flames, much less the golden-robed man. In addition, the flames had been just too powerful. The golden-robed man had been completely burned in an instant, and they had not been in time to act.

“Was that… the power of the Phoenix Bloodline?!”

A few powerful cultivators of the ancient clan glared at Ye Qingtang. Their expressions were extremely gloomy.

“Don’t underestimate your enemy.”

A cold light glittered in the eyes of the ancient clan’s powerful cultivators.

The power of this girl’s bloodline could probably be traced to ancient times. Furthermore, her body could be transformed into the pure power of fire. That would be difficult to deal with.

Before the powerful cultivators of the ancient tribe could make any move, the giant blood-red eye in the void suddenly started to move.

In an instant, the giant blood-red eye exploded in a storm of blood-red rays.

The next moment, everyone saw the blood-red rays condense into arrows, which continually rushed out from the eye. They shot towards this mainland in all directions.

Boom!

Boom! Boom!

Boom! Boom! Boom!

A blood-red arrow fell on a mountain near the Falling Sky Valley. Under everyone’s startled gaze, the entire mountain instantly transformed into dust and was completely crushed.

“Eye Of Extermination…?!”

At that moment, the powerful cultivators of the ancient tribe all looked shocked.

At that moment, everyone finally understood what the eye in the void was.

“Let’s go!”

The powerful cultivators of the ancient clan exchanged glances and instantly came to a decision.

Even a Yang Lord at the level of Yin Yang Perfected Lord could not withstand the huge power of the Eye of Extermination. If they even brushed against it, they would be reduced to dust.

But because of this mainland, the Eye of Extermination’s powers were weakened. However, the ancient hidden tribe was unwilling to go up against it casually. Even the power of a weakened Eye of Extermination was sufficient to severely injure them!

It was too dangerous to remain here. If they returned to the ancient clan, they might still be able to withstand the power of the Eye of Extermination.

With that, the powerful cultivators of the ancient clan flew into the void and vanished without a trace.
