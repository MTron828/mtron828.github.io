Chapter 2428: Death (2)

The monster was above Emperor level and with that close distance, the Flying Star Academy folks should not have been able to flee.

But… Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The monster didn’t kill them then.

Why?

Ye Qingtang just felt that something was not quite right, and she glanced at those behind.

Lei Yan and the others were carrying Lu Yuanxiang and his team. Even with the extra baggage, they were not slowed down as they held Divine Lord level abilities. But the distance between them and the monster was not wide enough. It would soon catch up with them.

Once that happened, the monster’s above-Emperor level power was not something they could hold themselves against.

“Split up!” Ye Qingtang suddenly ordered.

Lei Yan and his group were stunned.

Split up?

Ye Qingtang felt that this monster had already latched onto them as targets. Unable to defend themselves, they could only try their best to ensure as many survivors as possible.

The teenagers were completely frenzied now. Unable to think clearly for themselves, they instinctively followed Ye Qing’s orders.

This was like all past incidents.

Their Boss would never issue a wrong command.

The group immediately split up.

And the monster behind them chose its target.

Ye Qingtang saw the distance between the monster and her narrowing. A bitter smile tugged at the corners of her lips.

It looked like her conjecture was right. This monster was targeting a certain person in the group, and she was the “lucky chosen one”.

Ye Qingtang had no idea why this monster would choose to pursue her, but she heaved a sigh of relief.

At least her brats would be safe.

Ye Qingtang soon detected a powerful force coming at her from behind. A massive black shadow completely engulfed her and a gigantic monster appeared behind Ye Qingtang.

As the Flying Star Academy teacher said, that monster was beyond descriptive words. It was made up of countless black worms entangled together and wriggling endlessly. It looked like a mass of worms stuck together.

“I am so… lucky…” Ye Qingtang looked at the monster behind her. She could already feel the powerful aura exuded by it. It was far beyond her own level.

An above-Emperor level existence was able to crush her within seconds.

Since Ye Qingtang had been reborn, she had imagined all the different ways she might die. But she never imagined dying with this false identity and in such a strange place…

She had never seen such a monster before and didn’t know how to handle it.

As stipulated by the rules, she had left all her special artifacts outside the Wailing Well. She didn’t even have her Mirror of Illusions with her.

Now…

It seemed like certain death was near.

The massive monster expanded non-stop as if it wanted to swallow the entire area.

Suddenly, a blood-colored hole opened in the monster, and black fangs lined the blood-red hole.

It was the monster’s mouth!

A black shadow shot out of its jaws.

The black shadow was very powerful. All vegetation it made contact with instantly turned to ashes.

It was too fast!

Ye Qingtang was able to see the black shadow rushing toward her, but her body had no time to react!

She was doomed…
