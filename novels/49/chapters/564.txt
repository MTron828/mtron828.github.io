Chapter 565 The Difficultly-Maintained Peace (1)

“Holy Lady, how about I change a disguise…” The Blood Moon Elder looked at Ye Qingtang pleadingly.

However…

Ye Qingtang waved a hand casually and sized up the Blood Moon Elder’s appearance with a smile in her eyes. “A dignified Blood Moon Sect’s Elder has already surpassed ordinary humans. Why do you care about how other ordinary people view you? I think you are very pretty.”

“Pre… Pretty…”

The Blood Moon Elder’s lips twitched.

Holy Lady, you can’t be really blind, can you?

How weird is your aesthetic judgment for you to praise that without any change in your expression?!

The Blood Moon Elder tried to calm his emotions and finally spoke seriously. “Holy Lady, you seem to have some grudge with that lady just now.”

The Blood Moon Elder asked that because he realized that there was a cold glint in Ye Qingtang’s eyes when she looked at that above-average-looking lady earlier on.

“Indeed.” Ye Qingtang admitted.

“So do you want me…” The Blood Moon Elder motioned cutting his throat with his hand.

“Can you defeat her?” Ye Qingtang looked at the Blood Moon Elder. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The Blood Moon Elder’s expression froze immediately, and he no longer uttered a single word.

That lady was probably at Martial Qi Level Three. Given his current skills, he would only be pressed on the floor and pounded should he meet someone at Martial Qi Level Three.

“Let’s go.” Ye Qingtang waved a hand and brought the Blood Moon Elder into the mountain forest.

The mountain forest was enshrouded in an extremely strange energy fluctuation such that one could even see the ripples undulating in the air with their naked eyes.

After Xuanling Sect’s sect protecting array formation was broken, the mystic realm eventually landed in this mountain forest.

Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder had just entered the place, but furious scoldings and clashes of metal reverberated throughout.

“Holy Lady, someone is in a fight!” the Blood Moon Elder immediately said after hearing the sound.

“I’m not deaf.” Ye Qingtang swept the Blood Moon Elder a look and said rather indifferently.

The Blood Moon Elder could only keep his mouth shut and not say another word of crap.

Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder walked in the direction of the fighting sound and quickly realized that the source of the sound was from a large scale battle between forces from the Formidable Heavens Dynasty and the Nine Nights Dynasty.

Before entering the mystic realm, both forces had already suffered heavy casualties from the battle.

The two dynasties were originally eternal enemies, and there had been countless minor and major battles. This enmity had long sunk deep into the bones. As long as the forces from both dynasties met, they would definitely fight, and there would naturally be deaths.

Apart from the battle between the super sects of the Formidable Heavens Dynasty and Nine Nights Dynasty, internal conflicts rapidly erupted among various sects as well.

Half a day later, the large scale battle finally calmed down gradually until everyone got along in peace.

Everyone was aware that without the restraint of the sect’s heritage, the level of danger of the mystic realm would multiply by ten times and more from before. The casualties were already so serious before they entered. Once the mental demons really started, how were they to contend for the fiendcelestial beast within the mystic realm?

The super sects from the two dynasties were not fools. After a long battle, they finally stopped.

Eventually, the members of super sects from Formidable Heavens Dynasty and Nine Nights Dynasty laid a rule to temporarily get along together in peace before entering the mystic realm and to drive away everyone else other than members of a sect who were only allowed to enter the mystic realm.

Everyone found this mystic realm because of the news of a fiendcelestial beast.

The greater the number of people, the smaller the hope of obtaining it.
