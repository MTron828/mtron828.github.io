Chapter 2710: Wealthy (1)

300,000 cursed points. To say that Ye Qingtang was surprised was an understatement. She had not done anything different from Lan Shan and the rest while they were in that memory. Why was there such a huge difference in cursed points?

“Son of Destiny?”

Ye Qingtang frowned and thought to herself. Could it be that her cursed points were different from the others because she had become the Son of Destiny? Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Junior Sister Ye Yue, how many cursed points do you have?” Zhou Yun asked Ye Qingtang.

“Three…”

“Three? Why so little? The rest of us got at least 60.” Lan Shan interrupted before Ye Qingtang could finish speaking.

Ye Qingtang, “…”

“Three hundred thousand,” Ye Qingtang finished.

The whole group instantly fell silent and stared at Ye Qingtang in disbelief.

How many cursed points did she say she had?

300,000?!

“Junior Sister Ye Yue, are you kidding! 300,000?” One of the disciples stared at Ye Qingtang in disbelief.

“Yes, 300,000.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

“Shopkeeper, is there a mistake? Why did the rest of us get so little? My junior sister said she got 300,000!” One of them looked at the shopkeeper.

“Dear cultivators, anyone who manages to infer the truth from the memory will see a substantial increase in their cursed points. “Please reading on N?WN0V?L.0?G”If she got 300,000 cursed points, perhaps she managed to infer enough information.” The shopkeeper explained.

“Inferred enough information? Wasn’t it just an earth-shattering war that led to the destruction of the Fourth Domain? What other information can there be…”

Ye Qingtang’s eyes flickered. So that was the case.

After entering the memory, she indeed deduced some information.

The first point was about the Silver Star Holy Lord. Ye Qingtang speculated that Ling Yan should be the reincarnation of the Silver Star Holy Lord.

The second point was about the white tiger. Ye Qingtang speculated that it should be the little white tiger’s father…

The third point was regarding Tian. Ye Qingtang was certain that the existence known as Tian was the man who sent her away from the cursed hell.

Actually, there were still a few points that Ye Qingtang still did not understand. After the High Monk died, he turned into a lotus seed and wanted to reincarnate. As for who the High Monk’s reincarnation was, Ye Qingtang did not know and did not have any clues.

Also, who was the black shadow who killed the Silver Star Holy Lord and High Monk? And who was the other black shadow?

Ye Qingtang could not figure out these points no matter how hard she racked her brain. If she managed to figure out all that, her cursed points would be even more than 300,000.

“Are you stupid? Shut up!” Lan Shan frowned at the disciple who had complained to the shopkeeper. “What if it was a malfunction that caused Junior Sister Ye Yue’s curse points to skyrocket? Wouldn’t they take it all back if you ask?”

The disciple who had just spoken went pale. “Yes, yes, yes. Senior Brother Lan Shan is right. I have no complaints!”

“Shopkeeper, wrap up all the Heaven-level divine weapons in your shop. I want all of them,” Ye Qingtang said to the shopkeeper.

Everyone looked at Ye Qingtang and gave her a thumbs-up. They now knew what it meant to be wealthy!
