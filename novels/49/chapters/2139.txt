Jing Ze started to explain, “Lei Yan... he is the young master of the Leiting family. However... he was 11 or 12 years old before he finally returned to the Leiting family...”

To be honest, Jing Ze’s abilities were considered the worst amongst the group. But Lei Yan was not much better than him. If the two of them got into a real fight, no one could be sure who would win.

Jing Ze came from a normal family and didn’t have the support of a major clan. Lei Yan was different. But even under the careful grooming of the Leiting family, Lei Yan’s abilities were still mediocre. It was lamentable.

Regardless, Lei Yan appeared oblivious to his lack of abilities. There were quite a number of Leiting family disciples in the Netherworld Academy. Leveraging upon his status as the young master of the family, Lei Yan strutted around campus with his group of family disciples, showing off his authority. But in reality, no one held any sort of regard for him.

Ye Qingtang did not know much about the others and so listened to Jing Ze’s narration.

Yun Chen had pretty good innate talent but his physical body was weak. His body was unable to withstand overly powerful forces and so his cultivation progress was being dragged down.

As for Nangong Lie, he was a skirt-chaser and put all his focus on picking up pretty girls. Previously, he was nearly kicked out of the Netherworld Academy after he tried to pick up the granddaughter of one of the faculty heads.

“Teacher Ye, tell me. Has it ever happened that someone was born with extremely high innate talents, so high that he was touted as a prodigy, but thereafter went on to be mediocre? And his abilities even seemed to decrease?” Jing Ze suddenly raised this query after having thought of something.

“The world is big and wide, nothing is impossible. This situation can be rather common. Why? Have you met someone like that?”

Jing Ze hesitated before continuing. “Teacher Ye, you should have already noticed that every single one of us in this group suffers from some kind of constraint on our powers and innate talents. I don’t have a bloodline, Lei Yan missed out on the prime time to cultivate, Yun Chen has a weak body, while Nangong Lie is just unable to focus on cultivation. But Qin Feng... he is different...” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Oh?”

Jing Ze explained. “Qin Feng is very powerful. Long before he entered the Netherworld Academy, he was so powerful that people were afraid of him. He already reached the Paragon Eighth Heaven level by the time he was 10 years old. When he was first admitted into the Netherworld Academy, he was just about to break through to the Divine Lord level...”

Qin Feng was a true prodigy. He had garnered much attention when he first stepped foot into the Netherworld Academy.

Everyone knew that with Qin Feng’s innate talent, it wouldn’t be long before he broke through to the Divine Lord level. Even in an esteemed place like the Netherworld Academy, he was considered a top student.

But unexpectedly...

This famous prodigy fell off his pedestal not long after entering the Netherworld Academy. Over the past few years, Qin Feng’s powers showed no signs of progress. Instead, they started to decline at an astonishing speed.

He was already at the Paragon 10th Heaven level when he first entered the Netherworld Academy. But now, he had regressed to the Paragon Eighth Heaven level...

He had gone back to the standard he possessed when he was 10 years old.

Surprise flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes at Jing Ze’s narration.

This Qin Feng... his regression was too rapid.

Ye Qingtang could vaguely guess the reason why the Netherworld Academy wanted to kick Qin Feng out of the school.

After all, the Netherworld Academy was a top academy and expected its students to become more powerful.

But a prodigy like Qin Feng ended up regressing after entering the academy. This was a major blow to the Netherworld Academy and they would never allow this blemish to remain in their school.
