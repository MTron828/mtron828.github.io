Chapter 2696: Customer, Do You Want To Buy Something? (4)

Everyone was shocked when they heard the ethereal voice. That actually worked?!

In this ancient city, every shop must have a shopkeeper like that skeleton, right... If they killed all the shopkeepers, they should be able to get a lot of cursed points!

“That’s not right.” Zhou Yun looked at the skeleton that had been shattered by Lan Shan. He said expressionlessly, “If we kill all the shopkeepers, even if we can get a lot of cursed points, who will sell us the items? Without the shopkeepers, how can we make the transaction?”

As he spoke, Lan Shan had already grabbed a bunch of Heaven-level divine weapons and was about to rush out of the shop.

However, Lan Shan was sent flying back by an invisible force before he could leave the shop.

“This still doesn’t work...” Lan Shan sighed. He tossed the Heaven-level divine weapons onto the ground, a helpless look on his face.

“Lan Shan, you killed the shopkeeper. Even if we get cursed points, who are we going to trade them for these Heaven-level divine weapons?” Wan Rou frowned at Lan Shan.

Lan Shan was taken aback by Wan Rong’s words. It seemed... like that was indeed the case. Without the shopkeeper, it was impossible to trade. Those Heaven-level divine weapons would probably stay in this shop forever now.

“Kill a shopkeeper of the ancient city and be rewarded with 50 cursed points. Revive a shopkeeper of the ancient city for 100 cursed points.”

Before Lan Shan could say anything, the ethereal voice rang out again. As that ethereal voice faded, everyone saw the shattered bones being rapidly recovered to its original state.

Not only that, a colorful light appeared around Lan Shan, showing the information about his cursed points. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Negative 50 cursed points?”

Zhou Yun looked at Lan Shan with a strange expression.

“Why would he lose 50 points... didn’t he get 50 cursed points for killing the shopkeeper just now... this is too strange!” One of the Great Immortal Temple disciples said in surprise.

“He was indeed rewarded with 50 cursed points, but... that ethereal voice also said that 100 points would be deducted to revive the shopkeeper... could this be the case? This shopkeeper was killed by Senior Brother Lan Shan, so his points would be deducted to revive it...”

“That’s possible!”

“It must be as Junior Brother Zhang said. Otherwise, how could Senior Brother Lan Shan have lost 50 cursed points? What a big loss.”

At this moment, Lan Shan’s face was gloomy as he sneered. “Negative 50 points? What a joke. I won’t pay up. What can you do about it?!”

“That’s right, Senior Brother Lan Shan. No one can do anything to you.”

“What a joke. Do you think I was born timid? At most, I won’t buy any rare treasures. Forget about negative 50 cursed points. Go ahead and give me negative 1,000 or negative 10,000 points if you dare. No one can do anything to me!” Lan Shan pursed his lips nonchalantly.

However, the ethereal voice sounded once again. It was like a muffled thunderclap.

“All cultivators with negative points must replenish their points by the next day. Otherwise, they will be killed.”

Silence descended upon the room.
