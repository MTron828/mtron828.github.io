Chapter 2708: Battle For The Heavenly Dao (3)

“There is actually such a terrifying existence in this world… but why have we never heard of such a person? With such strength, he can completely rule this world.”

“Could it be that… he died of old age?”

“Impossible! With this cultivation level, he would have already attained immortality. How could he possibly die of old age!?”

At that moment, Ye Qingtang was not at all interested in the group’s discussion. Instead, her gaze landed on the Silver Star Holy Lord.

The Silver Star Holy Lord stood in the air, his profound gaze fixed on the black shadow. The sword in his hand hummed.

“Azure Dragon, leave.”

The Silver Star Holy Lord looked at the dragon below him.

“Why?” The azure dragon roared. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“You cannot die here… you must protect the Azure Dragon Clan… while I… will make a comeback!”

As soon as he finished speaking, everyone saw his body transform into a divine sword several tens of thousands of meters long.

Swoosh!

A piercing sound rang out as the longsword slashed towards the black shadow. However, the black figure did not dodge at all. With just a single finger, it blocked the divine sword.

The divine sword shattered.

The azure dragon made a hole in the fabric of space and entered it, disappearing without a trace.

...

“They’re all dead…” Zhang Chi said softly.

“What an eye-opener.” Zhou Yun nodded.

It was not an exaggeration to call this an epic battle.

Unfortunately, that black shadow’s strength was too terrifying. Even the Silver Star Holy Lord and High Monk, who were already invincible beings, were forced to their deaths.

Swoosh!

Another black shadow darted out. At this moment, two black figures were conversing in the sky.

“The Silver Star Holy Lord and High Monk are dead.”

“Heh, I’ve also killed the Heaven Ascension Sect Master and the Dark North Divine Buddha. I have destroyed their souls.”

“There’s enough Heavenly Dao power in the Fourth Domain. We’ll each take half according to our earlier agreement. Let’s see who can gain the acknowledgment of the Heavenly Dao and take the position of Tian.”

“It will be me, because… you will die!”

As the other black shadow spoke, his right palm rested gently on the black shadow that had killed Silver Star Holy Lord and High Monk.

“Heavenly Demon Devouring… you!”

“Haha, your Heavenly Dao power is also mine… in this way, no one will be able to compete with me for the position of Tian… From now on, I will rule over all generations!”

Under Ye Qingtang’s disbelieving gaze, one of the black shadows completely wiped out the other shadow with the Heavenly Demon Devouring power. The latter turned into a streak of red light and disappeared.

But its voice echoed from all directions. “Heh… I already knew that you would do this. Do you really think your Heavenly Demon Devouring power can do anything to me if I didn’t allow it?”

The shadow asked coldly, “What do you mean?”

“It’s a pity that my heart still has a flaw… but I do have to thank you for helping to kill me. Otherwise, with my strength, I wouldn’t be able to die even if I wanted to. After I fix my heart, I’ll come and find you once more.”

...

“Ha, by the time you fix your heart, I’ll have become Tian.” The black shadow laughed loudly.

However, as soon as he finished speaking, the temperature between the heavens and the earth suddenly reached an extreme.

A mighty figure slowly descended from the sky.

The newcomer had long hair that reached his waist. His movements were extraordinary as if he had walked out of a painting. He slowly walked over with a world-shaking aura.
