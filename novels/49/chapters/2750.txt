Chapter 2751: The Owner Of The Heart Of The Heavenly Dao (6)

Before Ye Qingtang could speak, an unbelievable karma energy erupted from Ah Yao’s body.

“Karma power… when…” Ah Yao sounded surprised.

Ye Qingtang was also in disbelief.

No matter how powerful Ling Yan was, it was impossible for him to get close to this woman, much less plant his karma energy in her. How did Ling Yan do it?!

“Do you remember in that era…” Ling Yan stared at Ye Qingtang and chuckled.” Although I promised you not to kill Ah Yao, I didn’t promise you not to plant karma energy in her. ”

“How did you know that she would use Sister Ah Yao’s body? And you even planted your karma energy in advance?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Ah Yao’s body is more compatible with her soul. There’s no need for her to use other people’s bodies,” Ling Yan explained.

Ye Qingtang asked, “So you’ve planned everything all along?”

“So far, it seems like that.” Ling Yan smiled.

“Damn it, who are you?!” Ah Yao glared at Ling Yan and shouted sternly.

“Han Cangming.” The smile on Ling Yan’s face faded.

“Han Cangming… impossible. My divine power has always been spying on Han Cangming. How can you be Han Cangming!”

Upon hearing that, Ling Yan shook his head. “Indeed. For this reason, I have made extensive plans to escape your prying eyes and control. You like to treat others as your chess pieces, so perhaps you should try being a chess piece yourself!”

“I must… kill you all!” Ah Yao roared.

However, the Heavenly Dao energy in her body quickly entered Ye Qingtang’s body.

“This, how…” Ah Yao was shocked when she saw the energy that she was rapidly losing.

“You are the same person. As for who is the main body, it might be you or Miss Ye… I used the karma power to make Miss Ye the main body. As for you, you are naturally just a part of Ye Qingtang’s body. Your Heavenly Dao energy is also Miss Ye’s.” Ling Yan’s lips curled up slightly.

Before Ye Qingtang could recover from her shock, Ah Yao screamed and turned into endless divine power that was absorbed by Ye Qingtang.

“Damn those with the Karma Bloodline… I’ve already said that the Karma Bloodline and the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline are the same. They shouldn’t exist.” The big yellow dog wagged its tail and looked at Ling Yan while gritting its teeth.

“Your grudge is with the Karma Bloodline Clan in the upper realm, it has nothing to do with him…” Ye Qingtang glanced at the yellow dog.

“You might say that, but I don’t like people with the Karma bloodline.” The yellow dog snorted coldly.

Ye Qingtang could not be bothered with the yellow dog.

Having absorbed the endless divine power in her body, it instantly rose to an incomprehensible limit. The Heavenly Dao power in the Heart of the Heavenly Dao now truly belonged to Ye Qingtang.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang could even casually sense the power of the Heavenly Dao hidden in the void. It seemed that the so-called power of the Heavenly Dao was no longer unattainable but was within reach. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Is this… the level of Tian…” Ye Qingtang’s body emitted a faint silver light and her every move was like the might of heaven.

“That’s nothing. You now have a vague understanding of what it will be like to be Tian. You haven’t even reached the ultimate threshold. The Heavenly Dao power you have now will at most give you the right to become a candidate for the position of Tian,” the big yellow dog retorted.

“I see…”

At this moment, Ye Qingtang finally understood how powerful Tian was.

It was an undefiable existence.
