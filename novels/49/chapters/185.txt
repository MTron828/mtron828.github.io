Chapter 186: Returning to the Sect (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Junior Sister Ye, are you still willing to come with us if there are any missions in the future?” At that instant, Gu Yanqiu could not help but invite Ye Qingtang.

Other outer sect disciples who came to submit their missions looked over in their direction because of Gu Yanqiu’s words.

Gu Yanqiu had a good reputation in the outer sect, and his team missions had the highest completion rate. Many disciples wanted to join his team, but Gu Yanqiu was stricter in picking teammates, and it was very difficult for him to look at ordinary disciples.

However…

Gu Yanqiu sent out a second mission invitation to a new disciple. What was going on?

Everyone was sure that she was a new disciple when they took a look at her. They were very surprised as to why Gu Yanqiu would favor her so much.

Ye Qingtang pondered for a moment and smiled. “I don’t intend to take on any more rewarded missions this month. I’ll tell Senior Brother Gu when I feel like taking on any missions.” After turning in Wu Qi’s head, her Xuanming points should last her for a period of time. Increasing her skills in the shortest time possible was then the key.

The surrounding disciples could not help but widen their eyes when they saw that Ye Qingtang actually rejected Gu Yanqiu’s invitation in public and suspected whether there was anything wrong with their ears.

In the outer sect, there were so many people who wanted to go on a team mission with Gu Yanqiu but did not have the opportunity to. But Gu Yanqiu already took the initiative to invite Ye Qingtang, and she actually rejected it straight up without thinking?!

Was this little junior sister an idiot!

Everyone began to look at Ye Qingtang incredulously.

Gu Yanqiu was, however, not shocked. He knew that Ye Qingtang was a girl with her own views. “Alright. Just find me or Qin Huan when you are free.”

It was already shocking for Gu Yanqiu to be rejected, but after being rejected, Gu Yanqiu was not at all repelled and even spoke so nicely to her…

Everyone was a little muddle-headed at that moment.

Since when was Gu Yanqiu so nice to talk to? Why had they not seen it before!

“You can hurry on with whatever you have. I have to distribute the Xuanming points to Meng Sheng and the rest. I’ll contact you next time.” Gu Yanqiu waved a hand to Ye Qingtang and led Qin Huan out of the Rewards Pavilion.

With Gu Yanqiu’s departure, everyone stared at Ye Qingtang even more boldly and openly.

Although they did know how much the reward for Gu Yanqiu’s mission was, rewarded missions that Gu Yanqiu would look at would not be too bad. But Gu Yanqiu said that the reward for this mission was small and that this little junior sister had an even bigger mission in her hands!

Everyone’s curiosity was piqued uncontrollably as they stretched their necks to look at the cloth bag in Ye Qingtang’s hand.

“I am here to submit a mission.” Ye Qingtang was long familiar with the set way of the Rewards Pavilion as she handed the cloth bag into the warden’s hand.

That warden looked at Ye Qingtang confusedly. Why did he not remember that this young lady came to take on a mission before?

But when the warden untied the bag that Ye Qingtang handed over, expressions of shock suddenly appeared on his face.

The warden looked up in surprise. In the Rewards Pavilion, the only mission that did not need to be taken on in advance was killing a villain on the Assassination Roll. He had managed the Rewards Pavilion for many years and clearly remembered all the faces of those villains on the Assassination Roll since a long time ago.

The thing in the opened bag was clearly the head of Wu Qi, a villain on the Assassination Roll!RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com
