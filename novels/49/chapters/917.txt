Chapter 918 The Divine Phoenix’s Trial (3)

However, as those cultivators were eating heartily, some others frowned and did not take any action.

Seated at the side of the long table, Ye Qingtang looked at the delicacies plainly without any intention to consume them.

“Why are you all not eating?”

Sensing the behavior of those people, the Divine Phoenix’s eyes landed on Ye Qingtang, and it asked in confusion.

Ye Qingtang slowly stood up and replied with cupped fists. “I just think it is a little strange; thus, I did not start eating.”

“Strange” The Divine Phoenix was taken aback. “So you’re saying that these delicacies are poisoned?”

Upon hearing that, the cultivators who were wolfing down the food stopped eating immediately and looked at the Divine Phoenix in shock. This Divine Phoenix could not have really poisoned the delicacies, could it…

“It’s not that I think you poisoned us.” Ye Qingtang shook her head and said slowly. “I just feel that it’s a little odd only.”

“Tell me what is odd,” the Divine Phoenix said calmly.

“How could there be food in this mystic realm? Let’s talk about this wine first. It requires specialized brewing, and there are no ingredients in the valley that could make it, let alone the technical process of making the wine.” Ye Qingtang explained slowly and continued.

“Even if the ingredients are available, I believe that you may not know how to make wine. Even if you do know, you may not have the tools… Next, these delicacies have a delightful appearance and smell. However, you do not have a physical body. How can you make these items? Moreover, the Divine Phoenix clan is adept at illusions… Hence, I feel that all of this is probably an illusion which you created, Lord Divine Phoenix.” Ye Qingtang looked up slightly at the Divine Phoenix with clear eyes.

“Illusion?”

After hearing Ye Qingtang’s explanation, the cultivators who were eating their hearts out found it rather unbelievable. If this was an illusion, it was a little too real. The taste of the wine and delicacies still lingered in their tongues.

Moreover, there were so many of them present, and the Divine Phoenix did not have any chance to execute an illusion on them.

Naturally, it was a different affair if the Divine Phoenix was incredibly powerful.

“You think that this is an illusion?” The Divine Phoenix looked at Ye Qingtang.

“It’s only my guess. I cannot be sure.” Ye Qingtang replied.

“What about you?” The Divine Phoenix looked at Yin Yang Child.

“Me? I’m afraid you would poison me.” Yin Yang Child replied straightly.

“You?” Very quickly, the Divine Phoenix looked at Black and White Holy Son.

“My body constitution is special. I don’t need to eat or drink.” Black and White Holy Son replied with a slight shrug.

“What about you then?” The Divine Phoenix looked at the Absolute Monarch of Heaven a while later.

“I’m not hungry,” replied the Absolute Monarch of Heaven.

The majority of the people at the scene thought that it was a little strange. Due to their habitual cautiousness, they did not begin eating

“What about you? Why did you eat?”

A moment later, the Divine Phoenix looked at the cultivators who consumed the food. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Why?” The cultivator who was pointed out by the Divine Phoenix was slightly dumbfounded. “Didn’t… Didn’t you ask us to eat…”

“You?” The Divine Phoenix looked at another person.

“I’m hungry!” That cultivator replied.

“Mhm… I understand now.” The Divine Phoenix nodded after gaining the answers.

As the Divine Phoenix finished its sentence, the small bamboo forest shattered like glass pieces.

Everyone’s expressions changed drastically when they returned to their senses.

Currently, they were still beside the stream of the mountain valley. Where were the delicacies from before?
