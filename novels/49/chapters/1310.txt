Chapter 1311: Everything Is Ready (1)

A crisp cracking noise pierced everyone’s eardrums.

The whip tore a bone-deep wound in the chest of the old man, who had collapsed on the ground. Their scalps crawled as they saw the flesh curl open.

But he continued to lie there motionlessly, without any reaction.

Mo Yunxian was completely stunned.

What was going on?

“Xian’er, stop that!” Mo You hurried over and grabbed the leather whip that Mo Yunxian was holding.

“Cousin, he…” Mo Yunxian was momentarily flustered.

“Miss Mo, Lord Mo, we will have to trouble you to come back with us to deal with today’s incident.” The officer in the lead could not bear to go on watching. How could this Miss Mo be so cruel as to whip a person’s body after he died?

“Why should I go with you?” Mo Yunxian’s expression immediately changed. She had not expected the old man to really be dead.

The lead officer was unwilling to continue arguing. He just ordered his men to bring Mo Yunxian and Mo You along. Mo Yunxian wanted to resist, but Mo You told her to act more prudently.

When he saw the group of soldiers take Mo Yunxian and Mo You away, the Eldest Prince, who was sitting in an elegant restaurant nearby, smiled.

“Elder Ye, based on your plan, Ling Yan still has a few other trusted subordinates besides Mo You and Mo Yunxian. We have also planned for them to commit crimes. Do you think our arrangements are alright?” The Eldest Prince raised his eyes slightly and looked at Ye Qingtang, who was standing nearby.

Everything that had happened today was arranged by him, in accordance with Ye Qingtang’s instructions.

Ye Qingtang maintained her slight, casual smile, as she saw the disappearing figures of Mo You and Mo Yunxian, who were being taken away.

“The bait was not bad.” Ye Qingtang’s gaze fell on the three people, lying dead on the ground. She sighed inwardly but did not allow her expression to change.

She knew very well why Mo Yunxian had reacted like that. After all, in her place, she also would not believe that someone would suddenly give up their life to frame her.

So Mo Yunxian’s thinking was correct. It was just that…

The Eldest Prince’s arrangements had evidently taken everything into account.

The Eldest Prince smiled and said, “Since we want to bring Ling Yan down, our plan must be flawless. My Third Royal Brother is so intelligent. If I found someone to feign dead, he would quickly find a plot hole. And if it’s just an argument or a fight, it will be hard to blow the matter up. The only way is to cause my Third Royal Brother’s loyal subordinates to publicly kill ordinary citizens to incur the wrath of the capital’s citizens. Only then will my Royal Father give weight to this matter.”

The Eldest Prince watched the three bodies being carried away as he spoke. His expression showed no sign of pity.

“These grandparents and their grandson were border refugees. They’ve been in the capital for half a year. If not for my kindness, they would have died long ago. Since I have need of them today, they naturally tried to do their best for me.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The Eldest Prince spoke casually.

Ye Qingtang’s face remained expressionless, but she laughed coldly in her heart.

She believed in the Eldest Prince’s viciousness, but not in his kindness.

The Eldest Prince must have some hold over this trio, and they were forced to give up their lives here.

Ye Qingtang had heard of the viciousness of the Eternal Dynasty’s Eldest Prince in her previous life. Now that she had met him, she realized he was even crueler than he was rumored to be.

“The tasks that Elder Ye handed to us are almost complete. We only need to wait for the men from the border to reach the capital before embarking on our plan,” the Eldest Prince said with a smile. “If we can bring Ling Yan down this time, it will really be thanks to Elder Ye’s advice.”
