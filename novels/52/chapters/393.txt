Shang spent the next couple of days just waiting in the camp. He obviously couldn’t train in his usual way in the encampment, but he could consume another beast heart at least. It might not be the heart of an Abomination, but Shang didn’t need to exclusively only use beast hearts.

By now, Shang’s power was at around 97% of a Mid Commander Stage beast, and he felt that he could still grow by quite a bit. In at most three more months, he should be ready to advance to the Late Commander Stage.

Finally, five days after Shang had arrived, something happened.

The normal barbarians didn’t feel like anything had changed, but Shang managed to pick up on the subtle cues.

Several of the Mage Towers were deactivated as the Mages left them. They didn’t seem to act suspiciously, but they quickly made their way to the northeast of the Zone.

The Mages that managed the camp were reduced from around six to only two as the other Mages entered the Mage Towers.

But there was one change that was even more important.

The Spirit Sense of the High Mage had vanished.

‘And that’s my cue to leave,’ Shang thought with a smirk.

The reason why Duke Whirlwind had chosen this specific frontline and this specific time was the Skythunder Kingdom’s plan for the war.

Over the past couple of months, the Skythunder Kingdom had gathered more and more forces on this frontline, forcing the Grandmountain Kingdom to also station more forces here.

But then, with the help of some Magic, the forces of the Skythunder Kingdom left without the Grandmountain Kingdom noticing.

The walls, towers, and defenses were still manned to the absolute brim on the Skythunder Kingdom’s side, but there was nothing behind them.

The defenses were essentially only a cardboard cutout.

Everyone else had traveled further north to attack a different frontline, which was at the northern end of this Zone.

Of course, something like this didn’t come without risks. If the Grandmountain Kingdom decided to attack this place right now, the defenses of the Skythunder Kingdom might be breached, which would be devastating.

However, the Skythunder Kingdom was certain that the Grandmountain Kingdom wouldn’t do that.

They were simply too intimidated.

They were doing their best just to keep the Skythunder Kingdom at bay, and they were even failing at that.

Actively attacking such an enemy?

That was suicide!

At least, that was how the Grandmountain Kingdom saw things.

With half of the True Mages and the High Mage gone, Shang could finally try escaping.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

‘Originally, I wanted to summon some Abominations, but I think the timing might make it a bit suspicious,’ Shang thought as he looked around the calm camp. ‘I should just go for it.’

Shang looked up and saw that around four Mage Towers were active.

‘Why don’t we help the Skythunder Kingdom a bit? After all, I only need to keep my ability to escape a secret. My power doesn’t necessarily need to remain a secret.’

‘It might actually be even better if Duke Whirlwind’s enemies believe me to be a powerful warrior. That might motivate them to strike me, which would open them up to a counterattack.’

Shang only smirked as he looked at the Mage Towers. ‘Might as well put on a show.’

Shang had already looked at the Mages. There were one Peak True Mage, two Late True Mages, five Mid True Mages, and 13 to 15 Early True Mages. Together with the High Mage, it would have been basically impossible for Shang to escape.

However, the High Mage, the Peak True Mage, one of the Late True Mages, and all five Mid True Mages had left for the north.

This meant that there were only one Late True Mage and 13 to 15 Early True Mages left in the encampment.

From the outside, just like the Skythunder Kingdom’s side, the defenses looked to be fully manned, but most of their power had secretly left them.

Shang glanced at a rather large building in the middle of the encampment.

This was where the leaders of the frontline lived and met. It was essentially the command center.

Shang quickly walked over.

“Halt!” the single True Mage that defended the entrance ordered. Normally, there were two, but this time, there was only one.

“I have a message for Major Sparker from Lord Hario!” Shang said respectfully with a salute.

Over the last couple of days, Shang had had plenty of time to find out the titles and names of all the important people.

The True Mage only furrowed his brows at Shang. “And why would he commission your services instead of using the Communication Crystal?” he asked.

“Sir, I don’t know!” Shang said. “I’m only following orders!”

The True Mage kept eying Shang suspiciously. “Did Lord Hario tell you something that you should tell the guard of the command center?”

“No, sir,” Shang said. “Only Major Sparker is allowed to hear the message.”

The True Mage kept eying Shang. “You do know that if you are lying, you will be executed right then and there, right?”

“I know, sir!” Shang said. “I’m just following orders!”

The True Mage kept looking at Shang suspiciously.

However, Shang’s power was truly pitiful. The True Mage could probably beat Shang up with only his body.

Even if that barbarian tried anything fishy, he wouldn’t pose any danger.

And if Shang was actually under the orders of Lord Hario, the True Mage might get severely punished.

“Go in,” the True Mage said with a cold voice as he opened the door.

“Thank you, sir!” Shang said as he quickly ran into the building.

Shang hurriedly ran up the stairs until he was in front of the biggest door.

Then, he knocked.

“Enter!” came the order from behind the door.

Shang quickly opened the door and looked at the Mage standing beside the table with a worried expression.

When Major Sparker saw Shang, he furrowed his brows.

Why was a lowly barbarian inside here?

“Major Sparker!” Shang shouted as he stepped forward with a crestfallen face. “I bring bad news!”

Major Sparker wasn’t a fan of Shang stepping closer, but he was more concerned with the news. “What’s the news?”

Shang continued stepping forward with nervousness. “A sword has been found!”

Major Sparker furrowed his brows in confusion.

BANG!

Major Sparker’s eyes opened widely in terror as he looked down.

An absolutely enormous sword had pierced his chest. It was so big that its edge went from his neck to his pelvis!

How had this sword been so fast?!

“Inside your chest,” Shang said with a smirk. “Well, torso.”

SHING!

Shang’s sword cut upward and bisected the Late True Mage like a sausage.

Without their Mana Shield active and while being in weapon’s distance of Shang, Mages were really not scary.

Shang quickly cut Major Sparker’s head off, dumped it inside his Space Ring, and put Major Sparker’s Space Ring into a small sack that hung on Shang’s waist. Sadly, Space Rings couldn’t be stored in other Space Rings. Sure, Shang could also put the Space Ring in his inner world, but he wanted this Space Ring to be found by Skythunder Kingdom’s border guards.

Shang slowly walked down the stairs and stopped in front of them.

Then, he took a deep breath.

“SKYTHUNDER KINGDOM SENDS THEIR REGARDS!”

BANG!

Sure enough, the front door burst open as the True Mage charged in.

CRACK!

Shang quickly arrived in front of him, tore his head off, pulled the corpse into a corner, and pocketed the Space Ring together with the head.

From the side of a wall, Shang glanced through the opened door.

It was forbidden for barbarians to approach the building unless specifically ordered.

Even though Shang had shouted, only the guard had heard him.

Shang saw that no one had noticed and smirked.

Then, he stepped out of the building…

And looked at the Mage Towers with a malicious smirk.
