Shang once again traveled to the southeast of the Empire, but this time it wasn't for defensive purposes.

Just before his arrival, Shang took out his Transmission Medal and announced his current strength, suggesting that he would target weaker Mid Mage Lords or Early Mage Lord Clouds to conceal his identity.

The Starlight Queen expressed her gratitude for Shang's decision to help once more, albeit after a couple of centuries. However, Shang brushed it off, stating that he would return in a century. He ended the communication and proceeded northward.

Although the Transmission Medal began to ring again, Shang ignored it and entered his Isolation Barrier to refine his techniques, particularly Sword Blood.

Having recently grasped Sword Blood, he needed to seamlessly incorporate it into his Battle Style. During his seclusion, Shang also summoned several Abomination Lords, aiming to prevent the rapid emergence of Abomination Lords after his advancement to the next Realm.

Normally, it took some time for more powerful Abominations to appear after Shang reached the next Realm. By keeping some of them within his Isolation Chamber at all times, he replicated the effect of the Lightning Manor's massive black pylons.

When Shang encountered his first Abomination Lord, he was taken aback.

It possessed raptor legs with black scales, a formidable tail, six muscular arms, and a broad back.

However, unlike the previous Abominations, it lacked tentacles on its body, with only a few emerging from its face. In the past, Abominations didn't resemble beasts and were rather monstrous.

Shang wondered how Abomination Kings would look if the trend continued, speculating that they might resemble aggressive and powerful black lizards, essentially beasts.

The progression seemed contrary to the expectation that Abominations would become more abstract as they grew stronger.

Curiosity aside, Shang refocused his attention on important matters. The Abomination Lords grew angry inside the Isolation Chamber, but Shang prevented them from attacking.

Although his Isolation Chamber, composed of Seventh Rank materials, theoretically had the strength to withstand Abominations in the Seventh Realm, Shang didn't want to take any chances.

·ƈθm There were different levels even within Seventh Rank materials, and if the Entropy Ore of his chamber was only at the Initial Seventh Rank, it could pose problems.

Fortunately, as the Child of Calamity, Shang could control all the Abominations, and they ceased their attack, standing motionless.

To avoid arousing suspicion, Shang had closed the door to the Isolation Chamber.

It would be strange if Amarius or the Lightning Emperor peered into the Isolation Barrier and saw a few Abomination Lords standing behind Shang.

Over the next century, Shang integrated Sword Blood into his fighting style and devised a plan for his advancement.

He planned to comprehend several non-essential Destinations for Warrior Kings, ensuring he had enough momentum to break into the Sword King Realm to secure his survival beyond his current lifespan.

He would then focus on comprehending the essential Destination for Warrior Emperors without consuming the momentum, reserving it for later use.

Once he achieved that, Shang would concentrate on comprehending the level six Concept of Entropy, possibly referring to Entropy itself.

Consuming this level six Concept's momentum would boost his mind and Affinities, elevating him to the same level as King Sanctified Death.

At this point, everything about Shang would be a level above his peers, allowing him to possess a sevenfold Spirit Sense.

Subsequently, Shang would employ the momentum from the non-essential Destinations and the essential Destination for Warrior Emperors to break through further.

He was confident that this path would lead him to a sevenfold Spirit Sense.

After approximately a century, Shang emerged from his Isolation Barrier. He consumed the Abomination Lords, noting that he could do so much faster than before, likely due to the Concept of Transformation.

This concept enabled him to consume a greater number of Abominations within a short period.Nnêw n0vel chapters are published on n0v/e/(lb)i(n.)co/m

Typically, it took around 500 years for Mage Lords to advance a level, assuming they focused solely on that aspect. Most Mage Lords advanced one level every 1,000 years due to other engagements, although it was possible to progress faster at the expense of power.

However, Shang was confident he could achieve a breakthrough within 500 years.

Nevertheless, Shang's requirement of 500 years differed significantly from other Mage Lords.

After all, Shang needed several times more Mana than regular mages. Therefore, if he continued absorbing Abomination Lords, he would reach the Peak Sword Lord Realm in approximately 2,000 years, leaving him with 18,000 years of longevity.

Once he formulated his plan, Shang left the Isolation Barrier and headed to the frontlines.

According to the Lightning Emperor's information, the contract should have been terminated by now, meaning that Mage Lords would be the ones engaged in the war.
