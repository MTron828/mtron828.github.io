Chapter 297 - Price

The Domain of Entropy had stopped the Domain of Darkness.

The enemy realized that something strange was happening, and he immediately pushed himself away from Shang.

A moment later, Shang stopped his Domain of Entropy.

Just like the opponent, Shang had lost a bit of his skin, but not nearly as much as him.

‘My Domain needs an energy source,’ Shang thought. ‘Usually, it would use the Mana inside my body, but since there is no Mana, it uses my own body. Luckily, I don’t feel like I lost my skin forever. This should be recoverable.’

Then, Shang looked at his opponent with narrowed eyes. ‘I might be able to counter his Domain now, but nothing else has changed. Without Mana, I can’t use my Domain to injure him!’

BANG!

Shang exploded with fire again, and he shot at his opponent with his sword.

The warrior released another pulse of darkness and retreated from Shang. At the same time, he began to rapidly spin his spear again.

Shang knew what that meant.

An instant later, three balls of darkness shot toward Shang.

‘He is low on Mana!’ Shang realized.

Shang threw his sword forward.

BANG!

The sword punched through one of the balls without any issues, but before it reached the opponent, it began to fly towards Shang again.

Right now, Shang was below his enemy, and gravity was on his side when it came to this throw.

The other two balls shot at Shang, and he punched both of them with his fists..

BANG! BANG!

A small explosion of light left Shang’s fists, neutralizing the balls. However, Shang’s hands lost a bit of their muscles.

BANG!

Shang exploded with ice and shot toward the warrior above him.

On his way, Shang took hold of Sword and readied it for a strike.

The warrior readied his spear again and pointed it at Shang.

Shang came closer to the enemy, but then something happened.

Shang noticed that a small ball had appeared beside him.

And in the next moment, Shang’s eyes widened in shock. He stopped his attack and curled into a ball.

He had recognized this ball!

It was a firebomb!

BOOOOOM!

The firebomb exploded beside Shang, flinging him at the second wall.

BANG!

Shang hit the wall with his back, breaking a couple of ribs. Thankfully, his spine was still in one piece due to the transplanted beast bones.

Unfortunately, Shang’s body began to rapidly spin again as he lost control.

During his spin, Shang felt another pulse of darkness, and he knew that his opponent would arrive very quickly.

Right now, Shang couldn’t care where he would end up, and he made his left hand explode with fire.

BANG!

Shang heard an explosion come from somewhere.

BANG!

And then, Shang felt an impact.

He had hit the other wall!

Luckily, since the walls were opposite of each other, the spin was reversed by the impact, and Shang could regain control over his body.

He quickly spotted his opponent again and readied his sword.

BANG!

Shang exploded forward again.

Instead of retreating, the warrior stabbed forward with his spear.

‘He should be out of Mana!’ Shang thought.

Shang knew that his opponent only had one arm, and he was planning on taking advantage of that.

Shang pointed his left hand towards the spear as his right hand held his sword.

He would let the spear pierce his hand and kill the enemy with his sword!

The two reached each other.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

BANG!

The spear pierced through Shang’s left hand, and Shang moved his hand to the side.

The tip of the spear went past Shang’s torso and missed.

But then, Shang’s eyes widened in horror.

Why was the spear only half as long as previously?!

At that moment, Shang saw that the spear had turned into two pieces!

The front piece was currently stuck in his left hand.

And the bottom?

Another pointy tip was revealed at the bottom part of the spear.

It was designed to be split into two!

The warrior currently used the other tip on the bottom half of the spear to strike Sword’s side.

CRACK!

Shang’s eyes widened.

A crack had appeared in Sword, and he could feel Sword’s pain.

This was a serious injury to it!

BANG!

Sword was thrown to the side, and Shang tried to keep hold of it.

However, the earlier price he had paid now came to haunt him.

In order to block the balls of darkness earlier, Shang had weakened his hands, which had weakened his grip.

Shang couldn’t keep hold of Sword, and it left his hand.

BANG!

Sword hit the wall, making it spin and slowing its fall.

This meant that Sword was now far out of Shang’s reach.

Shang had no weapon left!

His left hand was behind him since it had blocked the spear’s tip!

His right hand was flung to the side by trying to keep hold of Sword!

Shang’s torso and head were completely open!

And then, Shang felt and saw the pulse of darkness and the enemy’s spear rapidly growing in his vision.

Apparently, the enemy still had enough Mana to release one last pulse.

At that moment, time seemingly stopped for Shang again.

The enemy was too close and too fast.

He couldn’t escape with any of his blasts.

His legs and arms were not close enough to block.

He couldn’t evade.

And the spear was rapidly approaching the middle of his forehead.

After nearly three years, this peculiar feeling had returned.

The feeling of powerlessness.

Nothing Shang could do would save him.

He had lost.

Even though he had comprehended his Domain, he had still lost.

But at this moment, Shang’s mind suddenly calmed down.

It was almost like he had been lifted of a burden.

‘Fine,’ Shang thought. ‘To think that the first use of Entropy wouldn’t be against a Mage but against a warrior.’

‘What irony.’

At that instant, Shang’s body began to deteriorate rapidly.

His entire being was concentrated on his left eye.

And then, Shang’s left eye turned into dust and vanished.
