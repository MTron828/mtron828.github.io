Chapter 296 - Danger

BANG!

Shang’s back exploded with an incredible amount of fire, the countereffect of his Affinity cooling his back.

BANG!

Shang’s body was flung forward, and his shoulder hit the warrior in the chest, throwing both of them at the second wall.

BANG! CRRRRR!

Now, the warrior’s back was grinding against the wall.

At that moment, several Magic Circles appeared around him, and they began to warp and distort.

CRACK!

And then, they broke apart.

The warrior wouldn’t have died from that attack, but the armor needed to be intact to use the Magic Circles. The back of the armor had most of the Magic Circles, and they were essentially ground off by the hard wall.

As the two of them hit the wall, Shang quickly grabbed his opponent’s body and put the warrior’s arms below his.

Shang was treating this like an MMA fight on the ground.

The warrior quickly used a headbutt to get rid of Shang. He knew that his body was more powerful than Shang’s.

Shang’s head evaded the headbutt.

BANG!

And Shang butted the warrior in the side of the head!

Shang’s own head hurt a lot, but he knew that his opponent’s head hurt even more.

BANG!

Shang kneed the warrior in the chest while keeping his arms pinned. Due to the enemy’s armor, Shang’s knee broke, but the force pushed the enemy even more against the wall.

Just like Shang’s armor, the enemy’s armor was now also heating up and burning his back.

But then, something happened..

BOOOOM!

The enemy’s body exploded with Darkness Mana, and Shang was flung against the other wall.

Shang managed to somewhat keep his body in control after hitting the wall, and he looked at his opponent.

‘He used his Domain!’ Shang thought with narrowed eyes.

The enemy had unleashed his Darkness Mana into the surroundings, and it had consumed a lot of Shang’s life energy and Mana.

Healing became much more difficult for him now.

‘But every time he uses his Domain like this, he wastes a lot of his Mana. In comparison to me, he can’t use the Mana of his surroundings. At best, his Mana regenerates faster in this environment.’

As soon as Shang was flung away, the enemy’s body began to spin chaotically since he was no longer pinned against the rapidly moving wall.

Ding! Ding! Ding!

Shang just wanted to attack his enemy again, but he stopped with widened eyes.

The warrior had just hit the wall three times with different parts of his spear, which had completely negated the spin of his body!

He was in full control of his body again!

‘How is that possible?!’ Shang thought.

BANG!

Nevertheless, Shang exploded forward again.

BOOM!

Shang only hit the wall.

The warrior had used another pulse of darkness to slow his fall and pass over Shang.

And as soon as he was above Shang, he began to spin his spear at incredible speeds.

The spear became even darker as it was filled with more Darkness Mana.

And an instant later, five black balls shot out of the spear, which directly shot toward Shang.

‘This is the attack the Pest Queen used!’

Shang quickly threw himself off the wall again to evade the strikes…

But they were following him!

They passed Shang and curved towards him again!

At that moment, Shang gritted his teeth.

And the five bolts hit him!

However, just when they hit Shang, a burst of light came out of his body.

For the first time, there was a use for Shang’s Light Affinity!

It might not have the ability to injure someone, even if they had the Darkness Affinity, but it could deal with attacks made out of Darkness Mana!

Shang’s body lost a bit of its volume as Shang used the Light Mana since he had to sacrifice his life energy to use it, but he quickly recovered everything with his Mana.

But after that, Shang was completely out of Mana.

He wouldn’t be able to use his Warrior’s body to heal again in this fight.

BANG!

Ice Mana exploded out of Shang’s legs, and he directly shot at the warrior above him.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The warrior readied his spear, and a pulse of darkness left his back, his body now also accelerating towards Shang.

Shang extended his arm above him.

At this moment, time seemingly stood still.

The warrior was piercing towards Shang with his spear as Shang’s hand was extended above him.

And at that moment, a sword burning with black flames appeared in Shang’s extended hand!

Earlier, Shang had let go of Sword, and it had been gone all this time. During that time, Sword had moved closer to Shang, and it had finally arrived.

Even more, it had activated its Entropy Ability!

The enemy hadn’t noticed that Shang’s sword had returned to them, and he wasn’t prepared.

The sword burning with black flames struck down.

WHOOOM!

A black wave of black fire left Sword, shooting directly at the opponent. At the same time, Sword was burning away as it was using up its own mass.

The enemy released his Domain of Darkness again and used his spear to block.

BOOOOOM!

The black fire destroyed the Domain of Darkness, and even the spear vanished into thin air a moment later.

The black fire vanished, and Shang could see his opponent again.

His armor was completely destroyed, and all his skin was pink and red, which meant that the Entropy Ability had destroyed a huge layer of the opponent’s skin.

A couple of parts of the enemy’s body were even leaking blood, but it wasn’t too bad.

With his Domain of Darkness and his spear, the enemy had managed to survive the attack.

SHING!

And then, a new spear appeared in the opponent’s hands.

Someone as powerful and talented as this warrior had more than one weapon.

At that moment, the warrior saw Shang approach and put his spear in the way of his sword.

However, his eyes widened the next moment.

Why was Shang’s sword faster?!

Why was it smaller?!

Sword had sacrificed a huge part of its mass, but that didn’t mean that it became useless.

After all, Shang and Sword had planned for this event ever since they had received the Entropy Ore.

Back then, Shang had wanted Sword to remain bigger for exactly this reason.

Shang’s huge sword had become smaller and thinner.

It had nearly no handguard, and it was long and straight as a nail.

Yes, Sword had taken its original form again by burning away the excess mass!

The warrior had fought against Shang’s old sword all this time, and when it had suddenly changed shape, he had been taken by surprise.

Sword managed to bypass the spear, and it was about to strike the enemy’s torso.

But at that moment, the enemy’s experience kicked in, and he angled his body to the side.

Sword missed the enemy’s torso, but it got something else instead.

SHING!

The enemy’s left arm was cut off!

The enemy was thrown away, and Shang grabbed the arm.

An instant later, the arm turned into dust as Shang absorbed the remaining Mana and life energy.

The enemy hit the wall again with his feet, leaving behind a bloodied footprint.

And then, another pulse of darkness left him, and he shot at Shang again.

BANG!

Shang released an explosion of fire to evade the attack.

But then, the stump left behind on the opponent’s body pointed at Shang, and a bolt of darkness shot at Shang.

The attack had come so suddenly that Shang couldn’t react.

BOOOM!

Shang was hit in the chest and flung against the wall.

BANG!

Shang’s back hit the wall, and the front of his chest lost all Mana and life energy.

Shang’s freshly recovered life energy and Mana went to that spot and healed it, but Shang was left empty yet again.

A moment later, Shang blocked with his sword.

BANG!

The opponent had arrived again, but this time, he wasn’t striking at Shang.

Just like Shang, he had jumped towards him with his spear in a blocking position.

Shang’s back was grinding against the wall as the two weapons ground against each other.

And a moment later, the enemy activated his Domain of Darkness again!

At that moment, time seemingly froze for Shang, and he was thrown into an abyss of horror.

‘I have no life energy! I have no Mana! I can’t retreat!’

‘His Domain will kill me!’

In this moment of panic, Shang’s mind was as focused as never before.

It went through everything he knew, and it tried to come up with any kind of solution.

And at that moment, Shang finally comprehended something he had tried to understand for a long time.

The Domain of Darkness activated.

But just as it was about to consume Shang, it vanished.

It was almost like the Darkness Mana had stopped existing.

At the same time, the hair on the enemy’s head began to slowly turn into dust.

Shang had finally done it.

He had finally comprehended his own Domain!

‘This fight isn’t over!’
