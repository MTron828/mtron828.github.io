Chapter 295 - Falling

Shang and the mysterious assailant were thrown into the space behind the black wall, and they all began to fall.

Just mere moments ago, Shang had seen what was behind the wall, and he knew what was waiting for him…

And on what kind of strange battlefield he would have to fight for his life now?

After the first wall was an empty space, about ten meters wide. As soon as the Darkness Mana had flooded the space, Shang’s Darkness Vision had expanded by a lot.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

And this was all he could see.

There was a second wall after the first one, and that was it.

There was no floor, and the ceiling was over two kilometers higher than Shang’s current location.

So, as soon as the two of them burst through the first wall, they began to fall into endless darkness.

CRK!

Shang’s fingers nearly broke as the assailant violently pulled his spear back.

‘His body is stronger than mine!’ Shang realized. ‘This means he is, at least, at the Mid Commander Stage!’

By now, Shang had also gotten an opportunity to look at his opponent with his Darkness Vision, and he also realized how his opponent had managed to get the drop on him.

If Shang weren’t perfectly focusing on the assailant right now, he wouldn’t even notice him. He was almost as imperceptible as a ghost!

His body blended into the darkness, and Shang couldn’t even fully see his appearance.

Shang only knew that he was a warrior, about 190cm tall, and he had long black hair. He carried a long, thin, and black spear, which almost resembled a long needle..

SSHH!

The darkness around the assailant shifted, and his body moved to the first wall.

CRRRRRRRRRRR!

He tried to stop his fall by ramming his spear into the wall, but the wall was far too hard.

Shang quickly took out his sword and narrowed his eyes.

BANG!

Ice exploded out of Shang’s legs, and he shot at the assailant.

CLINK!

But Shang only hit the wall. The warrior had dodged to the side by kicking himself off the wall.

In the air, the man readied his spear and attacked Shang!

CRRK!

Shang parried the spear by angling his sword, making it miss.

Shang’s sword moved along the spear towards the warrior.

BANG!

Shang missed!

The warrior had put more power into his spear and hit the wall with it, throwing his own body back.

The warrior landed on the second wall while Shang slid down the first one.

BANG!

Both combatants jumped off their walls, directly at each other.

BANG!

Ice came out of Shang’s left hand, slowing his fall.

However, his enemy had only used a feint, and his spear already pointed at Shang, who was above him right now.

When Shang saw that, he changed his plan and stopped attacking.

Due to their different speeds, the distance between them would widen soon.

But mere moments later, Shang’s eyes widened, and he put his sword in front of him to block.

BOOM!

A wave of Darkness Mana hit Shang’s sword, and like a wave hitting a stone, it split apart, washing over him.

The outer parts of Shang’s body deteriorated slightly, but he quickly recovered.

‘That explains why I couldn’t find him in the darkness.’

Of course, the force of the ranged attack accelerated the warrior’s fall even more, creating more distance between him and Shang.

Shang looked down with narrowed eyes. ‘He even knows the ranged attack. Not many warriors know about it, which means he is quite talented and experienced. Together with his Darkness Affinity, he has probably gained some special training in his life.’

‘This is not an average warrior!’

BANG!

Shang’s back exploded with Ice, and he accelerated even more.

‘If I want to win, I have to end the fight during the fall. With my abilities, I have a huge advantage in the air!’

The two of them accelerated more and more, and the deeper they got, the stronger gravity became, which increased their speeds even more.

Darkness washed over the warrior, and he moved to the second wall again.

Shang readied his sword and slashed in the direction of his opponent.

A huge wave of Darkness left Shang’s sword and shot at the warrior with blinding speed.

There was so much Darkness Mana around them that Shang didn’t even need to load his sword with his own Darkness Mana. Sword just passively absorbed the Darkness Mana in this place.

BANG!

Suddenly, a pulse of darkness came out of the warrior’s body, and Shang’s attack was destroyed.

WHOM!

A second pulse left the warrior’s body, and he shot towards Shang, similar to the way Shang used his Ice and Fire Affinities to move around in the air.

The attack was so sudden and fast that Shang could barely react.

BANG!

The warrior didn’t stab towards Shang but attacked him with a sideways slash. It was almost like he was attacking Shang with a long stick.

Shang blocked the attack, but due to the difference in their physical strengths, Shang was shot at the wall.

BANG!

Shang’s back hit the wall, but the impact wasn’t powerful enough to injure him by much.

But that had never been the opponent’s goal.

As soon as Shang’s back hit the rapidly passing wall, the force of his fall made Shang rotate violently. It was like someone was jumping out of a race car and hitting the ground. Their body would also violently spin like a ragdoll.

In such a state, Shang could barely defend himself.

At the same time, the warrior lightly tapped the second wall with his feet and pushed himself at the rolling Shang.

Shang had no idea where he could retreat to. He was simply spinning way too fast!

So, Shang let go of Sword.

BANG! BANG!

Sword had quickly stabilized itself in the air and flew between Shang and the warrior, blocking the strike.

However, the power of the strike pushed the side of Sword into Shang, who was then pushed against the rapidly moving wall.

CRRRRRRRRRRRR!

The sound of the armor on Shang’s back grinding against the hard wall echoed throughout the entire area. His armor was damaged quite a bit, and Shang felt his back heat up.

But his body had stopped spinning!

Shang grabbed Sword again and violently pulled it to the side.

The tip of the spear that was still touching Sword was pushed upward.

Shang let go of Sword again and grabbed the pole of the spear with both of his hands as his back continued grinding against the wall.

Then, Shang pulled himself forward and kicked at the warrior’s chest.

BANG!

Shang’s eyes widened.

The warrior’s knee had pushed Shang’s kick to the side, leaving him open!

Then, from this position, the warrior kicked forward with the same leg.

BANG!

Shang’s armor cracked in several places, and the force even broke several of his ribs.

His back was pushed even harder against the wall, and the back of his armor began to glow in heat as it burned itself into Shang’s back.

An instant later, the warrior slashed down with his spear again. This time, Shang wouldn’t be able to block the attack!
