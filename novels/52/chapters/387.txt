Chapter 388 – Leniency Is Recklessness!

When it was shortly before noon, Shang got to work and connected with the Abominations.

This time, he would summon more than usual.

As the time to act came closer, Shang’s emotions became unruly.

He got a bit nervous and apprehensive about the actions he was about to commit, but he only gritted his teeth and suppressed these insecurities with rage and anger.

‘He must pay!’ he told himself as he contacted the Abominations.

‘I will make him pay!’

Shang connected with two Commander Stage Abominations and their inferiors.

It took a lot of his concentration, but he eventually managed to split one of the Commander Stage Abominations from the others.

One of the Commander Stage Abominations would appear right in front of him while all the others would appear at the same place.

Shang’s emotions continued to intensify, but he kept suppressing them with more and more anger.

‘Every enemy must die!’

Then, Shang’s angry gaze went to the middle of the Adamantite Behemoth Zone.

‘Come!’

SHING! SHING! SHING!

Over 800 Abominations appeared near the middle of the Zone as one of the Commander Stage Abominations appeared right beside Shang.

Shang immediately consumed the Abomination.

At this moment, the guards in the town looked with shocked horror at what they were seeing.

No!

This couldn’t be!

The alarm immediately rang throughout the town, and all the powerful Mages and warriors readied their weapons.

The assault began literally five seconds after the Abominations had appeared, which was an insanely fast reaction.

The first couple of attacks landed, killing several Abominations.

The forces were ready for the Abominations’ counterattack, but they were surprised when nothing happened.

The Abominations didn’t charge at the town.

What were they doing?

Why weren’t they attacking?

And then, all the Abominations began to charge.

However, they didn’t charge at the town.

No, they ran away from the town.

For a second, some confusion and relief appeared in the forces’ minds. After all, they only needed to hold out for about three minutes or so. That would be when the Empress Cobra would arrive to deal with the Abominations in this Zone.

As long as the Abominations didn’t attack the town, everything would be fine.

Shang’s right eye became bloodshot as he gritted his teeth so hard that blood came out.

‘My enemies must die!’

‘They must die!’

‘Leniency means putting myself at risk!’

‘Every problem must be dealt with!’

‘Leniency is recklessness!’

‘Leniency is carelessness!’

‘The crueler I am, the more people will be afraid of going against me in the future!’

‘For my future, I have to kill!’

The Mages didn’t stop their assault, but they also weren’t as scared as before.

The Abominations weren’t attacking them.

That was good.

But then, the atmosphere slowly began to change.

After some seconds, the more intelligent ones amongst the Mages realized where the Abominations were going toward.

No, this couldn’t be real!

This couldn’t happen!

This was a nightmare!

“KILL THEM!” the superiors shouted as they unleashed absolutely all their Mana at the Abominations.

The assault was devastating, but there were simply too many Abominations, and they didn’t even have nearly enough Mages or heavy weaponry to deal with them in a timely manner.

They simply didn’t have enough firepower!

Soon, a couple of Soldier Stage Abominations reached their target.

BOOOOOOM!

As soon as they reached their target, they exploded, but only a tiny bit of metal vanished.

When the Mages saw that, their fear only intensified.

They had to stop them!

Then, the General Stage Abominations reached their target and exploded.

BOOOOOOOOOOM!

Huge chunks of ore vanished one after the other.

And lastly, the Commander Stage Abomination reached its target.

BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!

Over a hundred meters of ore were turned into nothingness.

Splash!

A shower of blood appeared.

In the middle of the Zone, the gigantic horn of the Adamantite Behemoth had a sizable chunk removed from it, and blood was flowing out.

For a beast of such size and power, this only counted as a scratch wound.

But a scratch wound still hurt, even if it was not dangerous at all.

And then, the ground began to tremble.

Shang watched everything with a bloodshot eye.

‘Die!’

Back when Shang had arrived in this Zone, he had been shocked by the gigantic horn.

‘Die!’

And he had been surprised that Duke Mithril had decided to place his castle that close to the Adamantite Behemoth.

‘Die!’

Sure, it hadn’t moved for an eternity, but that wouldn’t always stay true, right?

‘Die!’

If it turned in its sleep, it would flatten the entire town together with Duke Mithril’s castle.

‘Die!’

If that happened, over a thousand people would die.

‘Die!’Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

CRAAAACK!

The metallic ground cracked in the surrounding kilometers, and the gigantic horn began to move.

‘Die!’

CRAAAAAAACK!

A humongous head came out of the ground, and all the Abominations around it began to explode due to the sheer amount of Metal Mana that assaulted them.

‘Die!’

And as the head appeared, it became obvious that Duke Mithril had built his castle on the end of the Adamantite Behemoth’s snout.

‘Die!’

The fate of the town was sealed.

The head moved.

The foundation cracked.

The buildings collapsed.

The castle broke apart.

The homes were turned into rubble.

“I WANT YOU ALL TO DIE!”

And the entire town toppled over like a toy building.

The metallic foundation beneath it was lifted as well.

The buildings had already collapsed, and there was nothing to hold the foundation up.

With a simple lift of its head, the Adamantite Behemoth flipped the hundreds of meters thick chunk of ore over.

BOOOOOOOOOM!

And it buried the town beneath it.

Shang’s heart was beating violently in his ears as he was consumed by rage.

In his rage-filled state, he couldn’t comprehend what he had just done, and he preferred it this way.

After seeing what he had done, Shang immediately charged towards the west, to the Northern Ice Wyvern Zone.

The Adamantite Behemoth looked at the Abominations around it with annoyance, gathered some Mana, and flooded them with it.

All the Abominations vanished.

At that moment, some lightning appeared around the fleeing Shang.

The Adamantite Behemoth glanced towards the west with annoyance and boredom.

That one was too far away, and it really didn’t want to get up.

A second later, more metal appeared around its horn, healing the injury.

And then, it simply lay down again.

More metal appeared above its head until it had completely disappeared.

It looked just as before, except for one difference.

There was one really big piece of ore lying a couple of hundred meters beside the ore.

No one would even think that a castle and a town had been there just a moment ago.

And the Adamantite Behemoth Zone fell into silence.
