The people looked at their new home.

 

It was strange.

 

From now on, they would live in a completely different place, and even more, they were living amongst a lot of warriors.

 

Additionally, these warriors used very different methods to achieve their power, and they probably also had their very own culture.

 

In a way, the warriors from Icy Bastion had lived more in the Mages' society. After all, Icy Bastion fully ran on the same rules as nearly every other town or city ran on, and all of those were run by Mages.

 

But here?

 

There probably wouldn't be a lot of Mages.

 

There wouldn't be a lot of Mage merchants.

 

There wouldn't be any strong beasts.

 

It was strange.

 

In a way, everyone felt like they had arrived in a place that was not as advanced as their previous home. Everything seemed a bit more primitive.

 

However, it also had a certain purity and homeliness to it. 

 

Yes, the surroundings were curated by the Lightning Manor, but the town itself was being run and expanded by warriors.

 

In here, the warriors were the ones in charge, not the Mages. At least, as long as one ignored that one was inside a Mage-controlled little world.

 

The Impose Stage warriors could already feel everyone in the small town with their Spirit Sense, and the Diamond Body Stage warriors felt their arrival as well.

 

Obviously, everyone had been informed about this day.

 

The strongest warriors of the town were looking at the arriving people with furrowed brows.

 

They weren't extremely happy about their arrival.

 

Sure, the Impose Stage had proven to be extremely powerful, but these people were also a threat to their culture.

 

Would they change everything in the town?

 

Even more, there weren't many people here that could resist these Impose Stage warriors.

 

Sure, there were far more Diamond Body Stage warriors than Impose Stage warriors present, but that didn't matter.

 

The strongest Diamond Body Stage warrior in the town was at the Mid Diamond Body Stage.

 

Everyone stronger than this individual had already left the town to join the real outside world. They had traveled to Star City to join the Warrior's Guild there under Elver.

 

When the warriors saw Lei and the silver-haired woman present, they knew that they were helpless in front of the new warriors.

 

The Impose Stage warriors would have more power and sway in this little world.

For a while, the new warriors just looked at the old ones in the town.

 

"What are your orders, Master?" the silver-haired woman asked Shang.

 

As the strongest warrior, Shang obviously would be the one in control.

 

"I don't have any orders," Shang said neutrally. "I will most likely not stay here."

 

This took most warriors by surprise.

 

He wouldn't stay here?

 

Why?!

 

The silver-haired woman looked over at Mistra, who sighed.

 

"Yes, he won't be part of all of this," Mistra explained. "He is going to work somewhere else, but if he has relevant knowledge for advancing the overall power of warriors, he will tell us, and we will forward this information to all of you."

 

The reactions to this news were mixed.

 

Eventually, the five Impose Stage warriors that had bowed to Shang earlier in Icy Bastion stepped in front of him again and bowed once more.

 

It was a last bow of respect.

 

They knew that they would most likely not see their Master again, or if they did, it would be far in the future.

 

Shang didn't particularly care. 

 

"Before you do anything," Mistra said, "I need to inform all of you about the rules."

 

The warriors nodded.

 

Then, Mistra turned to Shang. "Someone is waiting for you just 500 kilometers to the north. Please go to meet them."

 

Shang didn't say anything and took to the skies.

 

Then, he shot towards the north.

 

The Impose Stage warriors watched as Shang left.

 

Their Master had left them.

 

From now on, they had to depend on themselves.

 

Of course, things weren't as drastic or dramatic as the warriors made them out to be. After all, Shang's knowledge would still affect every warrior living here.

 

Mistra turned to everyone present and began to introduce them to how things worked around here while Shang simply continued flying towards the north.

 

Back in Area 23, he had started amongst warriors.

 

Then, he had been fighting against Mages with the warriors.

 

Then, after leaving Area 23, Shang was surrounded by nothing but Mages.

 

When he got Icy Bastion, Shang was surrounded by Mages while having his own town of warriors below him.

 

And now, Shang would be surrounded by nothing but Mages again.

 

Wherever Shang would end up surely wouldn't even have a single warrior.

 

Shang guessed that he would end up in a place with the strongest and most talented Mages in the entire world.

 

Sure, warriors could close the gap between them and Mages, but how many warriors could actually reach the heights of Battle-Strength that these elite few Mages could achieve?

 

The silver-haired woman was the closest, but at most, she might be able to jump one level against an Archmage.

 

Sure, that was impressive, but that was only barely on the level of maybe being accepted into the Lightning Manor in the Sixth Realm.

 

She wasn't on the level of the Mages that would be crafted into powerful Mage Lords, and the place where Shang would go was even an additional level above that.

 

Maybe in a couple of centuries, the warriors might produce one individual that could join the Mages that would one day become Mage Lords, but that would still be an entire level below Shang.

 

In terms of Battle-Strength, Shang was an enigma for warriors.

 

He was unnatural.

 

No warrior was supposed to become this powerful this quickly.

 

Eventually, Shang found someone near the edge of his Spirit Sense but acted like he didn't see them.

 

After advancing for another 50 kilometers, he actually looked at them with his Spirit Sense.

 

When Shang saw them, he was immediately convinced of something.

 

One fact immediately became clear to him.

 

Except for the Starlight Queen, who had been too powerful for Shang to evaluate, Shang had never seen a true genius in his entire life.

 

Until now.
