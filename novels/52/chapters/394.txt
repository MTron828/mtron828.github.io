BANG!

Nearly all the barbarians and Mages winced and looked in shock at the command center.

Its roof had just exploded off, and everyone could see flames come out from beneath the destroyed roof.

For two seconds, no one could react.

“HELP!” Shang shouted as he ran out in a panic.

There were burns all over his body, and he was bleeding in multiple places.

His face was full of terror.

“Lord Sparker has been assassinated!” he shouted.

The True Mages quickly looked at each other in shock.

Silence.

They were waiting for orders…

But there was no one left to order them!

The High Mage, the Peak Mage, and one of the Late True Mages had left.

And the last Late True Mage had just been killed!

“Tower Three, check the command center! We will protect you from the other towers!” one of the Mages shouted under these stressful circumstances.

This person was somewhat the unofficial leader amongst Early True Mages.

“Understood,” one of the Mages in Tower Three said.

The two Mages in Tower Three quickly left their Mage Towers and ran toward the command center.

Shang ran towards them, fear in his eyes.

When he saw that they had already activated their Mana Shields, he got annoyed.

Then, Shang seemed to stumble.

His left arm went towards the ground to catch him while his right arm went to his back.

An instant of silence.

Then, Shang looked upward with a narrowed right eye.

BANG!

Before Shang hit the ground, he exploded forward with a Fire Blast, cooling his body.

BOOOOOM!

Shang’s humongous sword hit the Early True Mage’s Mana Shield, breaking it in an instant.

No one could react in time.

As soon as the Mana Shield broke, Shang pointed his left index and middle fingers at the forehead of the Mage.

BANG!

A lance of fire left Shang’s two fingers and blew the True Mage’s head off.

After having trained his Affinity for so long, Shang had also upgraded his Fire Affinity.

Now, he could concentrate the fire in a small beam. It didn’t have nearly as much recoil as his Blasts, but the damage was much greater.

This attack was basically useless against a Mage with Mana Shield since its power was too small in exchange for the burden it put on Shang’s body, but a weak True Mage without a powerful body would die to that attack.

It didn’t have a lot of range, but it was still quite strong when someone was directly in front of it.

One could imagine the attack as the muzzle flash of a high-caliber gun without the bullet.

Shang called it Fire Lance.

BANG!

Shang released an Ice Blast and immediately arrived at the second Mage.

His sword destroyed the Mana Shield, and another Fire Lance also killed the second Mage.

In less than two seconds, Shang had killed two Early True Mages with their Mana Shields active.

“Kill him!” the unofficial leader shouted.

Shang had already put the corpses away into one of his Space Rings while pocketing their Space Rings when the unofficial leader shouted.

Due to Shang’s earlier alarm, the Mage Towers had already activated their Mana Shields and were ready to fire.

The barbarians looked with horror at the Mage Towers and Shang.

They had to flee!

Just by being close to Shang, they would die to the Mage Towers!

When the barbarians were about to run, the Mage Towers had already fired.

Several powerful fireballs were flying towards Shang with quite some speed.

BANG!

Shang charged to the side and avoided the explosions.

However, around twenty barbarians were turned to ash by them.

The True Mages truly didn’t care about the barbarians.

Shang immediately charged to the closest tower that wasn’t occupied…

And kicked.

BOOOOM!

A gigantic part of the Mage Tower’s wall exploded off, making the entire thing fall over.

One had to remember that Shang was essentially as strong as a Mid Commander Stage beast. One only needed to replace Shang with a twenty-meter-long rhinoceros to know what devastating damage Shang could cause to a five-meter-tall tower.

Even more, the Mage Tower’s defenses were their impressive Mana Shields, not their structural integrity. One Mage Tower could resist as much abuse as the Mana Shield of a Peak True Mage.

When the True Mages saw the tower collapse, their minds were filled with shock, realization, and fear.

They weren’t afraid of Shang’s power.

No, they were afraid for their unmanned Mage Towers!

Usually, in the case of an enemy attack, one of the leaders of the encampment would remotely activate the unmanned Mage Towers’ Mana Shields until True Mages arrived to man them. Activating the Mana Shields cost a lot of resources, which was why only Late True Mages and higher had the power to do that.

However, there were no Late True Mages or stronger present!

They couldn’t activate the Mana Shields!

As the tower crumbled, Shang immediately put it inside one of his new Space Rings, completely filling it to the brim. Usually, this wouldn’t be possible since there were Magic Circles imprinted on them to prevent that, but by toppling the tower, those Magic Circles got deactivated.

BANG!

After the toppled Mage Tower vanished, Shang immediately exploded to the next one.

Three fireballs shot at him, but Shang managed to avoid them. For now, the Mages were trying to kill him with the normal Spells, which made it easy for Shang to avoid getting hit, but that would soon change.

BOOOOM!

Shang destroyed another unmanned tower, filling another Space Ring with it.

“Change to Speed Spells!” the unofficial leader shouted.

When Shang heard that, he frowned. ‘Now, it becomes a bit dangerous.’

He glanced at one more unmanned tower. ‘But I can still destroy one last one. I can’t pocket it, but destroying it should be enough.’

Shang went from the side of the towers to the southeastern side of the encampment.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Now, one last Mage Tower was between Shang and the Skythunder Kingdom.

At that moment, Shang could feel several Spells with a lot of speed and large areas of destruction. They didn’t have as much power as the earlier ones, but they were faster and bigger, making it harder to avoid them.

Waves of wind, Fire Waves, and storms of icicles were shooting at Shang.

Shang looked at the tower.

“Ishah!”

BOOOOOM!

It was like a gigantic cannonball had shot through the last unmanned tower, and it exploded into pieces.

Shang arrived around 500 meters away from the tower, which had just started crumbling.

Behind the exploding tower, a mix of destructive Mana tore through the encampment.

Over 60 barbarians died in that attack.

Shang only glanced back with a grin.

And then, he began to run towards the Skythunder Kingdom.

The Mages quickly found him again and aimed their Spells at his new location.

BOOOOM!

BOOOOM!

Shang’s surroundings were torn apart by the gigantic forces of destruction, but with the additional distance, Shang managed to survive the explosions.

He didn’t manage to completely avoid all of them, and a couple of his bones broke, but they were quickly taken care of by his warrior’s body.

BOOOOOM!

More explosions occurred, but the further Shang got away from the Mage Towers, the easier it was to avoid their Spells. In this situation, Shang’s Pseudo-Spirit Sense did wonders for his ability to feel the Spells and avoid them.

The Mages’ fury increased as they realized that Shang would escape.

But there was nothing they could do!

And after around half a minute, Shang escaped the range of the Grandmountain Kingdom’s towers.

Shang only smirked, put one of his hands at his collar, and just broke it off.

CRK!

Shang squashed the metallic ring into a ball and let it fall to the ground behind him.

Then, he continued running towards the Skythunder Kingdom.

He wanted to walk there leisurely, but if the High Mage returned early, Shang might die.

He just wanted to be on the safe side.

After around two minutes, Shang entered the range of the Skythunder Kingdom’s Mage Towers, and he stopped.

They hadn’t yet shot at him, but they had definitely noticed the destruction in the distance behind him, and they had definitely seen him already.

SHING!

Duke Whirlwind’s emblem appeared in his hand, and he lifted it upwards for a couple of seconds.

SHING! BOOOOM!

After that, two destroyed Mage Towers and a couple of corpses appeared in front of Shang.

With a small jump, Shang landed on top of the destroyed Mage Towers and grabbed the head of Major Sparker.

He lifted the head high with a wide grin.

“Tell Duke Whirlwind that Shang is finally back!”
