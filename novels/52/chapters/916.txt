Shang could easily envision someone like King Sanctified Death resorting to extreme measures in order to comprehend two Concepts. In fact, Shang himself contemplated doing the same. His desire for supreme power made him open to understanding something as profound as the level six Concept of Death. However, he faced four significant challenges.

Firstly, Shang recognized the importance of having life around him.

While power remained his top priority, surrounding himself solely with death would be akin to being trapped within the Reality Tear once again.

It would render everything devoid of value, eventually leading to monotony.

Secondly, Shang lacked a Life Affinity, and it was unlikely that he would ever possess one. Although his affinity for Life may have reached a high level, it was insufficient.

Both Life and Death Affinities required compatible mindsets. Without a mindset attuned to the Death Affinity, prolonged exposure to Death Mana would quickly drive someone to self-destruction. The Life Affinity likely presented similar challenges, and Shang simply did not possess the suitable mindset.

This meant that once Shang annihilated the world, it would never return.

The third issue surprised Shang. He experienced a genuine sense of guilt when contemplating the destruction of an entire world. While Shang was willing to go to any lengths for power, he found himself uncomfortable with extinguishing all life within a world.

The notion of transforming Aterium into a realm of eternal silence and stillness did not sit well with him.

Lastly, Shang realized that he did not actually need the level six Concept of Death.

The Entropy Affinity appeared to be an even more potent and extreme form of death. Death signified the cessation of life, whereas Entropy encompassed the end of existence itself, including matter, movement, energy, space, and time.

It was conceivable that a theoretical level seven Concept of Death would simply be Entropy. Therefore, why fixate on the level six Concept of Death when Shang could focus on something superior instead?

Considering the circumstances, Shang posed a question to clarify his understanding. "So, you believe he intends to annihilate the entire world?" he asked.

The Lightning Emperor nodded. "As I mentioned, I'm not entirely certain, but it seems plausible."

"And the other Emperors are okay with that?" Shang inquired.

"Shang, for the Mage Emperors, the truth of the world and existence itself is unwavering. Life exists because the world desires its existence. If the world did not want it, life would not exist."

"So, even if that child threatens all of creation, they are certain he will not succeed. Perhaps this is merely a trial for the world's inhabitants."

Shang understood that the other Emperors held this belief, but he himself did not share it.

He recognized that the true will of the world lay with the deranged God. However, the entire Abomination phenomenon seemed to contradict that notion. Did the God truly control the Abominations or not?

The Lightning Emperor and Shang engaged in further conversation on various topics before the Lightning Emperor employed a potent spell to conceal Shang's intense aura.

At that moment, Shang's aura matched that of King Sanctified Death, and if others sensed his true aura, they would likely surmise that Shang was the person the Lightning Manor sought to foster.F√¥ll√¥w ùíèew stories at nùíê/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The Lightning Emperor also informed Shang that he only needed a few more years before the war would enter its next phase. In the meantime, Shang should focus on assisting the frontlines.

In recent years, the frontlines faced immense pressure as the Land and Sky Empire had managed to break the contract.

Fortunately, Kali had not yet violated her contract.

At present, the Land and Sky Empire and Judgment Palace had openly formed an alliance. The Land and Sky Empire had ceded a significant amount of land near the frontlines to the Judgment Palace, allowing them to unite with their Archmages and High Mages.

This intensified the pressure on the Lightning Manor.

Fortunately, the Judgment Palace was still engaged in combat with the Tower of Climate, which prevented them from fully concentrating their efforts on the Lightning Manor. Although the Tower of Climate did not exert excessive pressure on the Judgment Palace, the constant and unyielding pressure persisted.

Surprisingly, other events unfolded in the world, but they were unrelated to the Lightning Manor.

The Event Horizon Empire in the south waged war against the Sungod Mountain Empire in the southeast. Their motivations were rather simple-they were bored and desired conflict.

Linastra Boomwitch, driven by boredom, randomly attacked Isis Neweston's Empire.

Viewing this as a challenge, Isis Neweston retaliated in kind. There was minimal communication before or during the war.

Both parties agreed that a bit of warfare would help their mages grow stronger.

Currently, only two empires remained uninvolved in conflicts. The Darkcold Fortress in the northeast and the Deepsteel Pearl in the southwest.

The empresses of these empires possessed similar personalities but harbored animosity toward each other, which was why they resided at opposite ends of Aterium. Both were reticent and preferred minimal interaction with others, resulting in their isolation.

It was unlikely that they would join the war.

At present, the southeastern region of the Lightning Manor faced minimal pressure. The Judgment Palace had suffered substantial losses among their Ancestral Mages and needed to defend themselves against the Tower of Climate with a significant number of Ancestral Mages.

Consequently, the Judgment Palace largely disregarded the southeastern portion of the Lightning Manor and focused their attacks on the Archmage Zone west of the southeastern Ancestral Mage Zone.

The Land and Sky Empire had allocated a thin line of territories in the north, spanning nearly a million kilometers, to the Judgment Palace.

Naturally, such a slender line was vulnerable and could be easily severed by a single mage from the Lightning Manor, rendering the remaining territories defenseless.

However, the Land and Sky Empire still maintained control over these zones, transforming them into regions for Mage Lords. The Judgment Palace possessed an abundance of powerful Mage Lords, with over 2,000 permanently stationed in the ten territories along the line.

Additionally, an army of Archmages advanced through this line, heading straight for the Lightning Manor.

By now, the entire northern front of the Land and Sky Empire had become Mage Lord domains.

Mage Lords had become the pivotal force, and the message from the Land and Sky Empire to the Lightning Manor was clear: "If you wish to attack us, you must sacrifice numerous Mage Lords!"
