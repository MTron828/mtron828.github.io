The centipede charged at Shang with incredible speed, throwing the corrosive blood to the side.

Its scythes shone in the red light of the metallic cave.

For a moment, Shang was overwhelmed by the possible angles he could be attacked from.

Usually, beasts only had one to three different attacks they could launch, making their offense rather predictable.

But there was so much going on right now!

There were ten scythes, two gigantic mandibles, several spiky legs, and even more spikes that could be launched at Shang at any moment!

Right now, the centipede was facing Shang with its raised underside, pointing the spikes away from him, but he knew that if he managed to get past all the other weapons, the spikes would continue raining on him!

Shang glanced backward and saw that only around a hundred meters were left to the end of the cave.

For just a moment, Shang felt like he was about to die.

But then, his right eye narrowed.

This wasn’t the first time he was fighting something so powerful in relation to his own power!

Shang knew that he had to go all out and that he couldn’t die now!

However, he also knew that the offense was just too massive and impenetrable!Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

How was he supposed to get through so many scythes?!

‘I immediately have to get rid of some of its weapons! As long as it gets one chance to attack, I will die!’

This thing was an absolute killing machine. Even a single scythe was already something Shang had to use all his power to block, and it had ten!

‘I have to use all my power to weaken it immediately!’

Shang glanced at the blood pool beneath him.

Jumping into it would definitely injure him.

Shang gritted his teeth.

Then, he jumped into the pool.

As soon as Shang’s feet touched the pool, it started to vanish.

The air and blood around Shang started to turn into pure Mana.

Right now, Shang’s right eye shone in a black light.

Domain of Entropy!

Shang landed on the corroded metal beneath him and pulled his sword back.

CRRRR!

Then, Sword began to burn with black fire.

Shang’s stance lowered as the centipede was close to reaching him.

The Domain of Entropy intensified.

“Ishah!”

BANG!

Shang shot to the other end of the cave in an instant, leaving behind an empty trail devoid of blood.

CRACK! CRACK! CRACK!

A moment later, all the legs on the centipede’s left side broke off, followed by two scythes.

Shang had used his one use of Mana Step together with Sword’s Entropy and a colossal price for his Domain of Entropy.

The centipede fell to the side, creating waves with its blood as Shang jumped out of the pool, deactivating his Domain of Entropy.

Shang’s body hadn’t been injured in any place, even though he had just turned so much blood into Mana.

That was because Shang had sacrificed something else.

The black armor Shang had worn was turning into dust and scattering across the cave as more Mana.

Shang had sacrificed the armor Jerald had given him.

However, he hadn’t had any other choice.

Turning so much blood into Mana would have killed him, and he couldn’t sacrifice Sword.

“Sword!” Shang shouted immediately as he threw it at the centipede.

Sword had transformed into its Great Sword State, and it shot right at one of the scythes that had been cut off.

As soon as Sword touched it, the scythe turned into liquid metal, which wrapped around Sword.

At that point, Sword changed its angle and shot toward the second scythe, absorbing it as well.

With impressive speed, it suddenly turned around and shot toward Shang again, but it looked more like a throw than actual flight.

Sword was now at the True Path Stage, which meant that it could fly with quite some speed.

At the same time, the centipede was slowly righting itself.

Half its legs were gone, which meant that it had to use around three scythes to keep its body in balance.

Even more, that was only useful for the front of its body. The legs way at its back still only had one pair.

That was the problem with being so long and still using legs. If one lost their legs, their back would become nearly immobile.

Right now, the centipede was like a human without their legs. They needed to pull themselves forward with their arms.

Even more, it had to use the three remaining scythes from the very side it needed them the most.

Right now, only the five scythes on its right side could be used as weapons, but that was still terrifying enough.

However, the centipede’s power couldn’t be compared to its peak state anymore.

Earlier, Shang would have been helpless in front of it, but now, he had a chance!

Sword landed in Shang’s hands.

BOOOOM!

Sword hit the ground hard as Shang’s arms trembled with strain.

Sword had already become quite a bit heavier by being at the Early True Path Stage, but now, it had also absorbed two of those scythes.

From its Great Sword State, Sword had grown to a State even more ridiculous than the Colossal Sword State.

At this moment, Sword was over five meters long and nearly a meter wide.

It became nearly unwieldable to Shang.

“I will help you!” Sword told Shang.

Then, Sword became lighter, and Shang could actually lift it.

Sword had only managed to reach Shang with all this weight by using the momentum of Shang’s throw, and the weight hadn’t truly settled in until it landed.

Right now, Sword couldn’t fly anymore. All this additional weight and mass that wasn’t part of its usual body was weighing it down.

However, it could still use its power of flight to reduce its weight in Shang’s hands.

Shang slowly lifted up Sword, barely able to keep it in balance.

Shang gritted his teeth under the strain.

CRK! CRK! CRK!

Shang saw the centipede pull itself forward with its scythes as it readied all its other weapons.

Sword shone in the red cave with a metallic luster.

Shang lowered his stance and readied himself to strike.

Then, the centipede jumped forward.

And Shang struck forward.
