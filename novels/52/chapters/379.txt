Chapter 380 – Unfamiliar Face

Shang traveled through multiple Zones within the day. Most of them were unfamiliar to him, but the constant presence of the warriors and Mages gave him a feeling of security and familiarity.

He was in the Skythunder Kingdom.

He didn’t need to hide any longer.

Eventually, Shang reached a wasteland without any vegetation. It was filled with hills and pieces of dried rock.

After counting the Zones he had gone through, Shang was quite certain in which Zone he had arrived.

The Colossal Worm Zone, the Zone east of the Skythunder Zone.

Shang traversed it without any issues. This was Zone for Earth Affinity beasts, and the powerful ones were below the ground.

Any beast above ground was no threat to Shang in this Zone.

It was late in the evening when Shang reached the southwestern border of the Colossal Worm Zone.

In front of Shang was a desert with tons of lightning striking down.

Shang knew all too well where he was.

He had been here before.

Shang entered the Thunder Horse Zone and traveled towards the south.

After just a couple of minutes, Shang reached the border to the next Zone and began to run down the massive slope.

Luckily, the Thunder Horse hadn’t come to visit him.

It was the Adamantite Behemoth Zone, and Shang could see Duke Mithril’s castle from where he was currently.

‘I haven’t forgotten the bounty you put on my head,’ Shang thought.

‘It might take a couple of decades, but I will eventually pay you back for the bounty.’

Shang avoided the middle of the Zone and ran alongside its edges until he reached the southern border.

It was already quite dark, but as soon as Shang reached the border, it became pitch black.

The surroundings were filled with Darkness and Water Mana, and a normal human would have issues seeing their own hand in front of them.

The Empress Cobra Zone.

Formerly part of Duke Whirlwind’s territory.

As Shang arrived at the border, his right eye narrowed.

‘If I’m going to be attacked on my way to the Storm Eagle Zone, it will be here. This is the perfect Zone to create an ambush. Additionally, the high density of beasts during the night makes it easier to frame it as an accident.’

Shang only remained on this spot for a couple of seconds until he continued. His speed picked up quite a bit, mimicking the speed of an Initial Commander Stage warrior with the power of the Procedure.

It would take him quite a bit longer to get through the Zone like this, but the potential payoff was worth it.

For a couple of minutes, Shang continued traveling along the road. The wild beasts that came out of the poison swamps during the night very quickly fled when they saw him.

Suddenly, Shang’s right eye glanced to the right, but he quickly focused his eyes forward again as he tried to suppress a smirk.

Just now, he had felt a burst of Darkness Mana.

And the Darkness Mana felt very purposeful and orderly.

He was pretty sure that he had just triggered some form of Magic Circle.

However, Shang continued traveling down the road like he hadn’t noticed.

As Shang continued, the surroundings grew quieter and quieter.

Most of the beasts had vanished from this part of the Empress Cobra Zone, which hinted at a powerful threat that was present.

Shang only continued traveling.

And then, Shang smirked.

Right now, a powerful bolt of Darkness Mana mixed with something else shot towards him from the side of the road.

A normal warrior might not have noticed the silent and deadly bolt in such deep darkness, but Shang could feel and see it with no problem.

Shang had Darkness Vision and his Pseudo-Spirit Sense.

And for the first time, the images his two senses gave him differed.

Shang’s Darkness Vision showed three people…

But his Pseudo-Spirit Sense showed four.

Far behind the other three was one additional person sitting inside a silent stream of mixed Mana.

This stream of mixed Mana had obviously been created by a Magic Circle, and it isolated the person inside from all the Mana in the surroundings, making it impossible to sense them with any kind of Mana Sense.

Additionally, Shang’s Pseudo-Spirit Sense also showed him a couple of inactive Magic Circles. It was quite difficult for Shang to notice them since he had no idea how Magic Circles worked, but it was no problem for him to carefully feel the surrounding couple of meters.

‘Two Initial True Mages and one Mid True Mage. The person inside the Magic Circle doesn’t radiate any kind of threat. They probably don’t have a lot of power.’

‘I was afraid that you guys wouldn’t show up!’

BANG!

Shang suddenly accelerated and exploded forward with an Ice Blast.

Shang’s speed multiplied by several times, and he easily sidestepped the Poison Bolt.

The eyes of the Mages widened in shock when they saw their target suddenly reach incredible speeds.

In an instant, Shang reached the Mid True Mage, evading all the different Magic Circles on the ground while doing so.

BOOOM!

As Sword hit the Mana Shield of the Mage, a bolt of violent Darkness Mana exploded out of it.

CRACK!

With one attack, the Mana Shield broke!

One had to remember that Shang’s body was around 85% as powerful as the body of a Mid Commander Stage beast. Together with his insane speed and the Mana-destroying properties of his Darkness Mana, he could destroy the Mana Shield of a Mage of his level in one strike.

Additionally, this was obviously not a very powerful Mage. Shang even guessed that he was a weak one that hadn’t even undergone Mana Tranquility.

However, a Mid True Mage was definitely enough to deal with all the warriors that had undergone the Procedure. After all, they had only had ten years to grow.

SHING!

After destroying the Mana Shield, Sword beheaded the Mage.

The other Mages froze in shock and horror.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

This couldn’t be real!

BANG!

Shang exploded to one of them, destroyed their Mana Shield, and beheaded them in another instant.

“Ishah!”

Before the last Mage could react, Shang had already arrived in front of him.

BANG!

The third Mage was beheaded too.

BANG!

Shang immediately exploded towards the Magic Circle before the last person could react.

BANG!

Shang’s hand broke through the Magic Circle, took hold of the thing the person was holding in their hand, and pulled it out.

It was a Communication Crystal.

The person had just summoned the Communication Crystal after Shang had killed the third Mage.

However, Shang had been so fast that the person hadn’t even been able to activate it.

An instant later, Shang’s other hand went to their hand and ripped off a finger.

Shang heard a pained grunt come from inside the Magic Circle as he looked at the finger in his hand…

Or, more precisely, the Space Ring the finger wore.

Shang put the finger into his inner world and took hold of the person’s neck.

Then, he yanked them out.

It was a young man with long black hair. His body was quite powerful, being at around the Initial Commander Stage, but he hadn’t undergone the Procedure.

An unfamiliar face stared with horror at Shang.

However, Shang didn’t need to see the face of the person to know who they were.

The aura the person gave off felt somewhat familiar to Shang.

Together with all the other clues, it wasn’t very difficult for him to guess the identity of this person.

“What a pleasure to finally meet you face to face, Kiva Orvis,” Shang said with a malicious smirk.

Kiva Orvis felt a cold shiver run down his back.

“Or should I say…”

“One?”
