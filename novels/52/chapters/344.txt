Chapter 345 – Power Hierarchy

Shang took a deep breath as the cheering roared around him.

This was the most powerful beast he had ever fought, and it was also different from all the other ones.

It had a nearly infinite well of power, and its blood was filled with Ice Mana. Shang had never seen any beast like that before.

The wheel returned, but it didn’t begin spinning. Additionally, there was also no announcement.

Shang looked over at the jester.

The jester looked back with furrowed brows.

Then, the jester looked at Sword.

Shang knew what the God wanted to know.

SHING!

Shang summoned several pieces of ore from his Space Ring. He had been digging for ore for three months, and he had enough ore to spare.

Then, Shang put Sword into the ore, and Sword promptly started to absorb it.

When the jester saw that, a grin appeared on his face.

The God wanted to know if Shang wanted to cheat the system again by using a powerful attack but also not wanting to pay the price.

With his actions, Shang showed that he was willing to pay the price by using his own ore.

After a couple of seconds, Sword was finished.

“There is a problem,” Sword said.

Shang furrowed his brows and looked at it. “Yes?”

“I feel like my control over Entropy has lessened. I think the effects of the Entropy ore are not permanent.”Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Shang scratched his chin.

‘It actually makes sense. Sword had only absorbed the Entropy ore back when I returned from the battlefield. That was years ago, and it has used the attack several times by now.’

SHING!

Shang summoned the other half of the pedestal. Luckily, he hadn’t thrown it away.

Sword quickly absorbed the other half and regained its control.

“I think the stronger I become, the more of the Entropy ore I use with my attack,” Sword said. “I estimate that, with my current power, I can only unleash the attack three more times before I lose the ability.”

“I need more ore, and it has to be stronger,” Sword explained.

Shang scratched his chin. “It makes sense, actually. It would be surprising if one piece of General Stage ore could keep you going until the very end. What about the Entropy ore around these huge black buildings under the ground?”

“I’m still too weak,” Sword answered. “By my estimations, the outer wall is made of Entropy ore that’s, at least, at the Peak of the Fifth Realm. I need to reach the Fifth Realm myself to even attempt to absorb it properly.”

Shang frowned but nodded. “So, we need to search for a Commander Stage piece somewhere.”

“Yes,” Sword answered.

After Sword absorbed the ore, it regained its old size and shape.

Then, Shang looked at the jester. “What was that beast?”

“The Ice King,” the jester said with a grin. “Or, at least, one of its progenies.”

Shang lifted an eyebrow.

The jester only grinned back.

They didn’t say anything for several seconds.

“Well, I presume I can tell you a bit,” the jester said with a chuckle. “You amused me quite a bit, and your progress definitely hasn’t disappointed me.”

Shang didn’t answer.

“The Ice King is one of the most powerful beasts in the entire world,” the jester said. “It might not be in the top ten, but it’s definitely in the top 1000.”

Shang’s insides shook when he heard that.

When the humans talked about the entire world, they only meant the five Kingdoms.

However, when the God talked about the entire world, he was actually talking about the entire world.

This included all these powerful existences that Shang had never even heard of.

“I presume that Zone Beasts are weaker than this Ice King?” Shang asked.

“They can’t be compared,” the jester said with a smirk.

“The humans that call themselves King in these lands are only small children playing pretend,” the jester said. “The true Kings are in a Realm these people don’t even know of.”

Shang tried to guess how strong the Ice King actually was, which was when he remembered something.

“What about the Lightning Emperor?” Shang asked.

Shang still remembered that extremely powerful woman that had teleported him with a wave of her hand. She had said that the black buildings belonged to the Lightning Emperor.

The jester’s smirk widened. “Quite smart.”

For a couple of seconds, the God thought about if he wanted to answer the question or not.

“Emperors are more powerful than Kings, right?” the jester said with a knowing smile.

Shang’s right eye narrowed.

This told him a lot!

The real Ice King belonged to the top 1000 beasts in the world, but the Lightning Emperor was stronger than the Ice King.

The Lightning Emperor wasn’t even called Lightning King, but Lightning Emperor. This probably meant that he was an entire Realm stronger than the Ice King.

‘So, I have actually met someone that worked for one of the most powerful humans in the entire world.’

‘The Lightning Emperor, huh? I wonder what kind of person he is.’

‘Lightning Emperor. Mage Emperor.’

‘They are probably at the same Realm. Of course, the Mage Emperor was probably more powerful.’

Slowly, Shang was able to grasp the power hierarchy of this world.

And it was massive.

The Dean could kill Shang in one hit.

Duke Whirlwind could kill the Dean in one hit.

King Skythunder could kill Duke Whirlwind in one hit.

A Zone Beast could kill King Skythunder in one hit.

The Ice King could kill a Zone Beast in one hit.

The Lightning Emperor could kill the Ice King in one hit.

The Mage Emperor could kill the Lightning Emperor in one hit.

And then…

Shang looked at the jester.

When Shang had met the God for the first time, he hadn’t been able to grasp the God’s true power.

Only now did he truly realize how unimaginably powerful the God was.

Sure enough, the entire world was his playground.

This entire world was only a toy.

All existences in this grand world, no matter how powerful, only existed to amuse the God.

This thought woke a lot of complex emotions.
