BANG!

Shang exploded diagonally to his left, but he wouldn’t be fast enough to evade the two cuts since they were very wide.

CRACK!

That was, if the Mana Shield of the Mage Tower weren’t between him and the cuts now.

Yes, instead of attacking the Mana Shield, Shang had charged around it, using it as a shield.

The Mana Shield cracked apart, and the remaining force of the two cuts was no longer dangerous to Sword. Shang easily blocked the remainder.

When the High Mage saw that, her eyes widened in horror, and she gnashed her teeth.

She had just destroyed her own Mana Shields!

The next moment, the other Mages only saw Shang explode into the tower.

BOOOOM!

The tower blew apart.

BANG!

A moment later, blood and chunks of flesh shot out of one side like they had been shot out of a cannon.

BANG!

In the next instant, a head shot out of the collapsing tower.

Both Mages inside the tower had obviously died.

BANG!

Then, everyone saw Shang shoot at the fourth tower.

The High Mage grew infuriated.

Some mere warrior had managed to kill six Mages and destroy three Mage Towers under her watch!

She had never received such a disgrace!

She narrowed her eyes.

SHING!

And vanished.

She had had enough of fighting Shang from several hundred meters of distance! This distance gave him a chance to react to her Spells, and she couldn’t allow more of her Mages to die!

As Shang was close to reaching the fourth tower, the High Mage appeared just about twenty meters away from him on the ground.

From such a distance, Shang would barely be able to react to her Spells.

At the same time, she and her Focus had already readied another two Cutting Waves.

Then, from just twenty meters away from Shang, she unleashed both Spells.

When Shang saw her, a fire appeared inside his right eye.

The two Cutting Waves were unleashed.

And they hit Shang.

BANG! BANG!

But then, more Magic Runes appeared around Shang.

Shang was no longer wearing the cheap shit.

This was an extremely expensive set of armor that Jerald had specifically prepared for Shang.

It could block more than one Spell.

This was the advantage of being a member of a Kingdom.

Such an amazing set of armor would have been impossible for Shang to get his hands on anywhere else.

When the High Mage saw that, she furrowed her brows, but she also saw how the Magic Runes had acted.

They had just unleashed their last bit of power.

Shang’s armor wouldn’t be able to block another attack for, at least, several more minutes, which might as well be days in such a high-speed battle.

He would die to her next set of Spells.

BANG!

Suddenly, her eyes widened in shock.

Shang hadn’t attacked the tower.

No, he had charged at her!

It would have been impossible for Shang to reach the High Mage earlier, but it became possible if there were only 20 meters between them.

This might as well be within arm’s reach for Shang.

The High Mage had just unleashed all her prepared Spells, and she hadn’t expected Shang to reach her this quickly.

At the last moment, she aborted the chanting of her offensive Spell and switched to Mana Shield.

A High Mage could create their Mana Shield at terrifying speeds, and it activated just as Shang reached her.

Shang’s saber immediately hit her Mana Shield, an explosion of black lightning going across it.

The High Mage noticed with shock that this attack had exhausted 10% of her Mana!

BANG!

And a second explosion of black lightning appeared just a moment later.

Sword’s Saber State was far faster than its Great Sword or Colossal Sword States.

For a moment, the High Mage was shocked that Shang could hit her again.

Usually, if a beast or a warrior hit a Mage’s Mana Shield, they would be thrown into the distance by the force.

But then, she realized that Shang was attacking her from above.

This meant that her Mana Shield wasn’t being thrown away but nailed into the ground!

Nevertheless, she didn’t lose her entire composure.

She would be able to cast four or more Spells before Shang could get through her Mana Shield.

So, she quickly readied her next Spell.

When Shang saw her prepare her next Spell, a small glimmer appeared in his right eye.

He unleashed his next attack, but this time, there was no black lightning.

No, this time, there was black fire!

BOOOOOM!

The black fire hit the High Mage’s Mana Shield, and her eyes widened in shock.

She just lost 30% of her Mana in one strike!

In less than a second, this warrior had exhausted over 50% of her total Mana!

She quickly looked at Shang, and she saw a smirk.

Sword had returned to its original state, the Long Sword State.

And, right now, there was more black fire around it.

The High Mage realized that this was the attack that consumed so much of her Mana.

She would probably be able to finish and unleash her Spell before the next attack hit.

But what if this warrior had something else up his sleeve?

What if he had more surprises?

Even more, she felt a terrifying feeling of death coming from Shang.

Shang swung down.

SHING!

But the High Mage had vanished.

Shang easily stopped his strike as the black fire vanished, and his smirk widened.

Obviously, Shang couldn’t use Sword’s Entropy again. It would essentially kill Sword.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

This had been a bluff.

Shang knew that he couldn’t kill the High Mage.

If she actually went through with unleashing her Spell, there was a 90% chance of Shang dying immediately.

However, he was sure that he could bluff his way out of this predicament.

He knew that there were too many unknowns about his power in the eyes of others.

Fear of the unknown was a terrifying thing, and Shang knew that he could use it to his advantage.

An instant later, the High Mage appeared nearly an entire kilometer away from Shang.

Her Mana was already recovering at a rapid rate.

In fact, she regenerated about 5% of her Mana per second.

When Shang saw that the High Mage had appeared far away, he knew that this was his best chance.

Some of the Mage Towers readied more Spells, but due to the Shang basically being inside the encampment and their disorganized state, they were essentially no threat to Shang.

BANG!

Shang evaded a couple of Spells as he shot into the sky.

This time, he was not charging at a Mage Tower.

Shang quickly reached about a height of a hundred meters and looked at the encampment.

There were probably around 200 barbarians and maybe 15 more True Mages just scattered around.

They had all been watching with helpless shock as Shang had essentially torn through nearly half of their Mage Towers.

At this moment, time seemingly froze.

Shang was looking down as the people of the Grandmountain Kingdom looked up at him.

SHING! SHING! SHING! SHING!

An instant later, around 50 black balls appeared above Shang.

SHING!

Then, something strange appeared in Shang’s left hand.

It was a gigantic… shovel?

It was over three meters long and nearly two meters wide, making it look more like a spatula.

Shang pulled the gigantic shovel back.

And at that moment, the Mages realized what was about to happen.

The barbarians had no idea.

With terror, the Mages immediately used Mana Step to flee.

And then, Shang swung the gigantic shovel downward toward the black balls.

The Mages knew these balls.

These were Firebombs!

They were used to destroy large waves of beasts!

An instant later, the shovel hit the Firebombs with its backside, its round shape shooting the Firebombs in different directions.

The people in the encampment looked with horror at the shower of Firebombs.

The Mages in the towers looked with horror at the Firebombs.

And the High Mage looked with horror at the Firebombs.

And then, the Firebombs hit the encampment.

BOOOOOOM!

BOOOOOOM!

BOOOOOOM!

BOOOOOOM!
