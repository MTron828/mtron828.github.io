"Shut up! He doesn't deserve the title of Saint!" contestant 12 shouted.

 

The audience grew a bit confused when they heard about the Fallen Saint.

 

Although almost all of them were Mages, they had still heard of the Progenitor Saint and the one that invented the Diamond Body.

 

But they hadn't heard of a Fallen Saint before.

 

Who was that?

 

Many of the Mages were asking the warriors in the audience via voice transmission who the Fallen Saint was.

 

The warriors didn't like talking about the Fallen Saint, but the oppressive Spirit Sense of so many Archmages and Ancestral Mages was too much to handle.

 

So, they talked.

 

The Fallen Saint.

 

He had joined the legendary warrior academy as a young boy at the Peak Soldier Stage.

 

Originally, he had been very weak, and people believed him to be untalented and weak.

 

But then, he started to grow with incredible power, and he had also been the one that had undergone the first Bloodline Infusion.

 

Just that accomplishment alone would net him a title as a Champion, but this had only been the beginning.

 

His power grew only more and more ridiculous as more time passed.

 

He was the one that brought the Star Map to the warriors, the key to their success.

 

He was also the first warrior that received a noble title.

 

Even more, according to records, he had been the most powerful warrior that had ever lived.

 

In the Early True Path Stage, he managed to overwhelm Duke Torrent, who had been in the Late High Mage Realm. That had been a jump of two levels against a Mage.

 

And then, during the final battle of the Revolutionary War, he essentially won the entire war for everyone.

 

According to what the witnesses from back then had said, he had killed three Council Members with only the help of some Magic Circles while also supporting every other battle.

 

However, the last three parts were considered controversial.

 

Over 600 years had passed since the Revolutionary War, and only two people that had fought in the war personally were still alive.

 

And these two avoided talking about the Fallen Saint for obvious reasons.

 

As of now, the public's opinion was split.

 

One side believed that the Fallen Saint's powers had been exaggerated, while the other side believed the tales about his power.

 

In terms of accomplishments, the Fallen Saint had contributed about as much as the Progenitor Saint.

 

However, his last actions had thrown the world of warriors into an internal conflict.

 

According to Queen Eternalfrost and Prince Eternalfrost, the Fallen Saint had killed the legendary King Storm, the benefactor of warriorkind.

 

With the death of King Storm, Area 23 had been thrown into an age of instability.

 

The Magic Purity Kingdom took advantage of their weakness and launched a full-scale assault on the Storm Kingdom.

 

Over 80% of True Path Stage warriors and High Mages died, but before the Magic Purity Kingdom could annihilate the former Storm Kingdom, a new King suddenly rose.

 

No one had known the King before that moment, but his power was incredible.

 

But he had also been the last King.

 

Some months later, the people of Area 23 saw their world change.

 

The veil had been lifted.

 

An impossibly powerful Mage with silver hair had stepped forward and publicly announced the truth about the world…

 

Or Area 23, as they knew it.

 

Ever since then, Area 23 had transformed from a land of five Kingdoms into a land of three Camps. 

 

From a land of Kingdoms, everything had transformed into a land of cruel games.

 

Since Area 23 was on top of a gigantic plateau, only people in the Fourth Realm could escape, which meant that everyone was stuck there…

 

And the Lightning Manor encouraged fighting.

 

In the end, the people were doomed to either live in war-torn lands for their entire lives or reach the Fourth Realm and escape into the peaceful outside world.

 

Area 23 had forever changed, and that change had happened because of King Storm's death.

 

If the Fallen Saint hadn't killed King Storm, there would be nearly ten times as many True Path Stage and Diamond Body Stage warriors right now. 

 

However, the Fallen Saint had also contributed an insane amount to the warriors.

 

This was why people didn't like talking about him.

 

In honor of his accomplishments, they had bestowed him the title of Saint, but due to his sins, they also tried their best not to talk about him.

 

He was a symbol of a warrior's power, but he was also a symbol of a warrior's aggression.

 

The warriors knew that the Mages were the undisputed rulers of the world, and the warriors didn't want to associate with one of their kind that had killed someone from the Lightning Manor.

 

They didn't want to anger the Lightning Manor.

 

To some people, the Fallen Saint was an inspiration, but they would never dare to say that publicly.

 

What the Fallen Saint had done was disgusting and abhorrent.

 

He had killed King Storm, his best friend and the warrior's benefactor.

 

He had been a monster.

 

However, he had also been more powerful than everyone else.

 

But the times had changed.

 

All of this happened over 500 years ago, and the world had changed.

 

The old warriors were dead, and the new warriors had taken over.

 

The world was going forward, and at one point, the Fallen Saint would be forgotten. The warriors were doing their best so that this would be the case.

 

After the spectating warriors explained this to the asking Mages, everyone's attention went back to the fight.

 

"Don't speak of him!" contestant 12 shouted in fury. "He killed King Storm! Do not compare me to a monster like him! If it weren't for him, Teacher would still be alive!"

 

Contestant 1 snorted, but he didn't answer.

 

Instead, contestant 1 slowly advanced on contestant 12 with his two swords.

 

Over the next minute, contestant 12 attacked contestant 1 with all his power, but contestant 1 seemed to only be playing with contestant 12.

 

He easily blocked contestant 12's attacks while kicking his shield again and again.

 

Surprisingly, the onlookers' opinions were split into two camps.

 

One camp saw the sheer dominance of contestant 1, while the other camp was impressed by contestant 12 being able to fight contestant 1 for so long with such a difference in levels.

 

The people talked to each other via voice transmissions as they watched the fight.

 

"This is it? This is what the warriors in the Lightning Manor's Empire can do? This is just sad."

 

Contestant 1 and contestant 12 jumped away from each other, and they looked in the same direction.

 

Due to how Spirit Senses worked, the audience was only allowed to converse via voice transmissions. Otherwise, everyone would automatically hear every conversation of every other person in the audience, which would be annoying and distracting.

 

Yet, someone had dared to speak up without masking their voice at all, and to top it all off, he had slandered all the warriors present.

 

Because of that, everyone had heard him.

 

This was far beyond disrespectful!

 

Everyone looked over with furrowed brows.

 

There were five people, and all five of them were wearing enchanted cloaks that hid their auras and features.

 

All their cloaks were differently colored, and they were positioned on three different levels, showing an obvious difference in status.

 

There were two people at the lowest level. Their cloaks were red and silver.

 

Then, there were two people in the middle. Their cloaks were black and white.

 

Lastly, there was one person at the top, and their cloak was ocean blue.

 

The one in the silver cloak had spoken up just now.

 

The officials of the tournament wanted to apprehend the troublemakers, but they were stopped by a voice transmission coming from Lord Starsky.

"Don't do anything reckless," he told them with a serious tone. 

 

"The one in the blue cloak is a Mage Lord."
