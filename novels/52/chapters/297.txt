Chapter 298 - Death and Hope

The left side of Shang’s vision vanished, leaving nothing but darkness behind.

But at the same time, Shang could see his opponent vanish with his right eye.

In but an instant, his opponent stopped existing.

It was almost like he had never been there.

However, the walls didn’t even react.

Apparently, Entropy had no effect on them.

Shang’s desecrated and frail body was falling at unimaginable speeds, and he didn’t even have the strength to move.

BANG!

At that moment, a mountain of different objects appeared above Shang.

Entropy had destroyed not only the opponent but also his Space Ring.

When a Space Ring was destroyed, all the things would appear in the real world again.

Shang couldn’t possibly survive the fall like this. After all, he had no Mana, and he couldn’t even unleash any of his blasts. If he did, the resulting blood loss would kill him.

With a weak and panting expression, Shang scanned the objects falling above him.

He saw spears, armor, tons of gold, Mana Crystals, bombs, and…

Pills!

Thanks to the Warrior’s Academy, Shang knew about the commonly used pills..

‘A Recovery Pill!’ Shang thought with panic, hope, and desire.

Recovery Pills were mainly used by soldiers that had to fight several times in rapid succession. It couldn’t be used in a fight, but it helped in recovering Mana and healing injuries.

‘As long as I get the Recovery Pill, I have a chance!’

Shang used all his power to barely slowly move his right arm towards the pill.

Shang felt like he was lifting a mountain as he moved his arm.

The Recover Pill was so close!

Shang closed his hand.

But he missed.

With horror, Shang saw how the Recovery Pill got further and further away!

It wasn’t nearly as heavy as Shang, and it had already reached its terminal velocity!

Shang felt his world break down, and he quickly looked at the other belongings.

Several of the lighter things had already slowed down, and Shang even saw a bright crystal leave him.

‘Light Mana Stone!’ Shang thought in panic as he looked at the vanishing crystal.

A moment later, everything useful was out of reach.

‘No! I can’t die here! I can’t!’ Shang thought in terror.

However, no matter how much he willed it, he couldn’t get closer to the things he needed.

At that moment, Shang knew that he would die.

He had killed his opponent, but the fall would kill him.

Shang had no idea how fast he was falling right now, but the entire world had turned into a blur.

He didn’t even know how far he had fallen by now, but it had to be at least ten kilometers.

‘So, this is how it ends, huh?’ Shang thought. ‘I will die as a puddle of guts and blood, killed by a fall.’

‘For years, I felt most comfortable fighting in the air. My opponents couldn’t rival my agility and speed in the air.’

‘But now, I’m falling to my death.’

‘I guess that’s it for my path to power.’

Shang took a deep breath as he tried to come to terms with his death.

‘Do I regret how I lived?’

Silence.

‘I regret a couple of things, but overall, I think I did rather well.’

Shang thought back to his journey in this world.

He had gone through a lot in only six years.

But that didn’t matter anymore.

At that moment, Shang felt like he saw a distant light appear above him.

For a second, Shang believed that this was something that appeared when one died, but then he remembered that he had died a couple of times before, and he had never seen something like that.

And then, Shang’s remaining eye regained life and hope.

It was the Light Mana Stone!

It was coming towards him!

A second later, Shang saw the reason.

“Sword!” Shang shouted in his raspy and weak voice.

The cracked Sword was pushing the Light Mana Stone towards Shang!

Shang extended his right arm…

And the Light Mana Stone landed in it.

“Don’t die,” Sword said. “I don’t want to be alone.”

These words hit Shang in the heart, and he was as thankful as never before that he had Sword in his life.

When Shang touched the crystal, he absorbed all the Light Mana inside it.

Light Mana Stones were generally used to help warriors recover faster while training, but since Shang had a Light Affinity, he could also directly absorb them.

Sword hadn’t known about the Recovery Pill, but it felt the Light Mana in the crystal.

Three seconds later, the crystal lost all its Mana, and Shang recovered a slight bit of his Mana.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

SHING!

With this bit of Mana, Shang could access his Space Ring. Since his inner world couldn’t be properly used during battle, Shang kept all of his immediately useful items in his Space Ring. Sadly, one needed a bit of Mana to access it.

At that moment, Shang finally felt the end of the fall with his Darkness Vision.

An instant later, a talisman appeared in Shang’s hand, and he activated it.

Wind Mana appeared around Shang, and it slowed his fall.

This was the talisman that Shang would have used to get back to Warrior’s Paradise!

The Wind Mana violently moved against the rapidly passing air.

The heavier items passed Shang, and he soon saw the lighter items again.

The talisman had slowed Shang’s fall by a lot, but he was still falling at fatal speeds.

Eventually, Shang reached the Recovery Pill, and he quickly consumed it.

And then, Shang waited.

It took a couple of seconds, but eventually, Shang’s Mana began to slowly refill even more.

The ground came closer.

Shang didn’t move as he concentrated on absorbing the Mana.

Eventually, the Wind Mana vanished as the talisman got used up.

Shang opened his remaining eye, a fire burning inside it.

BANG!

Ice exploded out of his back, slowing his fall even more.

BANG!

Fire exploded out of it, and Shang’s position was changed.

BANG! BANG! BANG!

Shang exploded several times with fire and ice.

All the items had passed him at incredible speeds.

And eventually, the ground arrived.

BOOOOOOM!

Shang landed on some pieces of ore and armor with his legs, which quickly crumbled into pieces.

Shang’s torso also collapsed into a mess, and blood exploded out of his body.

And then, Shang used all his recovered Mana to heal his torso and head.

‘I survived!’

That was the last thought before Shang lost consciousness.
