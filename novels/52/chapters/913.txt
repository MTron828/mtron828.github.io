The clouds dispersed, and Shang emerged.

He appeared unchanged, but his Aura had become more radiant and heavier.

If anyone could sense his Aura, they would find all other Auras pale in comparison, as its intensity surpassed their perception of reality.

Shang slowly raised his hand and clenched it.

To his surprise, it was rather unremarkable. Having already reached this level of power using Void Break, it had become his new normal.

Not much had changed for Shang. He simply felt that the world had become clearer, and his body had grown stronger.

The true disparity in power between Realms didn't lie within the Realms themselves, but in the comprehension required to reach them.

After attaining the Seventh Realm, Shang's first action was to check his Spirit Sense.

"60,000 kilometers. Sixfold," Shang thought, somewhat astonished.

Upon further reflection, it made sense.

Obtaining an additional level in Spirit Sense demanded exponentially more comprehension and momentum. The first four levels were relatively straightforward, requiring the understanding of concepts to double its capacity.

However, progressing from the fivefold Spirit Sense became significantly more challenging.

At that point, one had to grasp concepts beyond their current level. It was akin to reaching greater heights rather than greater distances, attainable only through concepts surpassing their current abilities.

While it was theoretically possible to achieve such heights through sheer momentum, it was exceedingly difficult.

Reaching a fourfold Spirit Sense felt two-dimensional, while a fivefold Spirit Sense felt three-dimensional.

The journey from the first four levels to the fifth level was distinct and required a different approach.

The same held true for the gap between the fivefold and sixfold levels.

Acquiring an additional level in Spirit Sense necessitated consuming momentum that propelled one's starting position higher. It was akin to taking two leaps instead of one, as a single jump fell short.

And a sevenfold Spirit Sense was even more extraordinary.

1, 2, 4.

4, 2, 1.

This sequence of numbers seemed to align with how Spirit Sense operated.

The first category had four levels, each requiring an effort of one.NnÃªw n0vel chapters are published on n0v/e/(lb)i(n.)co/m

The second category had two levels, each requiring an effort of two.

The third category had one level, requiring an effort of four.

While Shang had elevated his being once more, it was insufficient to reach a sevenfold Spirit Sense. He needed to elevate every aspect of his existence by an entire level.

Void Break had raised his physical power by a whole level but had not increased his mind or Affinities.

The Transformation concept had elevated his mind and Affinities, but only by 50%.

Considering that having an Affinity meant having 100% alignment with something, Shang's Affinities had only increased by about 50%.

Furthermore, his mental power had doubled instead of quadrupled, which signified a one-level difference.

"To attain a sevenfold Spirit Sense, I likely need to elevate everything by an entire level," Shang pondered. "And it's possible that a sevenfold Spirit Sense is the maximum achievable level."

"I still possess a sixfold Spirit Sense, despite being far more powerful than when I reached the Void Break Realm," he contemplated. "What about King Sanctified Death?"

"He obtained a sixfold Spirit Sense upon becoming a Mage Lord, and nobody knows what happened when he became a Mage King!"

"If he managed to undergo a Transformation in the Ancestral Mage Realm, it's highly probable he underwent another in the Mage Lord Realm."

"Although he would still possess a sixfold Spirit Sense, it would differ significantly from his previous one."

"As a Mage King, he likely attained Affinities in all aspects and his mind grew even stronger."

"Thus, King Sanctified Death probably possesses the mental power of a Mage Emperor and Affinity for everything."

"Every Mage Emperor has already comprehended the level six Concept of their Affinity as Peak Mage Kings. It wouldn't be far-fetched to assume the same for King Sanctified Death."

If anyone were privy to Shang's thoughts, comprehending the extent of his analysis would prove challenging.

"King Sanctified Death might possess knowledge of every existing Concept."

Shang needed time to come to terms with this notion.

Lucius had a sixfold Spirit Sense.

King Sanctified Death had a sixfold Spirit Sense.

So, was Lucius as powerful as King Sanctified Death?

Only after grasping the vastness of the sixfold Spirit Sense did Shang realize the significant disparity between the two.

Lucius may be the Child of Calamity, but Shang was certain that King Sanctified Death would emerge victorious in a battle.

Mastery over every Affinity.

Mastery over the world.

Mastery over reality.

"King Sanctified Death might possess the power to defeat one of the living Mage Emperors."

Following his breakthrough, Shang finally comprehended the immense power of a sixfold Spirit Sense.

"I have underestimated King Sanctified Death!"

"If we were on the same level, he might defeat me in a battle without me resorting to Entropy."

Shang took a deep breath, refocusing on his immediate breakthrough.

"First, I should name this Realm."

"The level five Concept and Sword Blood both have their places in two Paths. One for Mage Kings and the other for Warrior Kings."

"My Path doesn't precisely align with either, and I am not yet a King."

"Sword Lord seems appropriate."

The Sword Lord Realm.

The name wasn't particularly unique, but it reflected the distinctive identity of Shang's Path.

With the name decided, Shang delved into his memories, ready for the next question and its answer, as always.
