The Lightning Emperor's words affirmed Shang's suspicions.

It turned out that King Sanctified Death had also undergone two Transformations, just like Shang had speculated. Furthermore, he had a significant advantage of over 25,000 years compared to Shang.

Curiosity got the better of Shang, and he inquired, "Do you think he has mastered all level six Concepts?"

The Lightning Emperor appeared shocked at the question and pondered, scratching his chin. Initially, it seemed impossible, but considering King Sanctified Death's exceptional talent, strong mindset, and extraordinary Affinities, it wasn't entirely out of the realm of possibility.

The Lightning Emperor responded, "Not yet. He's only about 40,000 years old. While he's undoubtedly the most formidable individual I've ever encountered, I don't believe even he can grasp all Concepts so quickly."

"Perhaps in another 20,000 years or so, I can envision him comprehending all the Concepts. But as of now, it's unlikely."

A sense of relief washed over the Lightning Emperor as he contemplated the situation. He realized that the encounter with Kali and Adam might have yielded even better results than expected.

"If that young one manages to grasp all the level six Concepts soon, he might take drastic action and challenge one of us, most likely me. This would make him a Mage Emperor in about 20,000 years from now."

"However, with the whole tournament and Adam's demise, he has no reason to take such a risk. He will simply bide his time until the tournament and become a Mage Emperor without any danger."

The Lightning Emperor pondered the power of King Sanctified Death and felt uncertain about it.

Suddenly, Shang expressed his desire to know something. He looked at the Lightning Emperor and asked, "What is King Sanctified Death's goal? What does he aim to achieve?"

Shang understood that King Sanctified Death was similar to him in some ways but wasn't sure if they shared the same objectives.

"It's difficult to ascertain," the Lightning Emperor replied. "That young one never reveals the truth and keeps everything about himself shrouded in secrecy. I can't even grasp his true personality."

"However, his contradictory existence poses a threat to the entire world."

"In case you weren't aware, he is the sole offspring of the Emperor of Life and the Empress of Death. Logically speaking, he shouldn't even exist. Life and death are diametrically opposed, as opposite as can be. How could someone embody both?"

"To do so, they would need to possess extreme empathy and apathy simultaneously. They would desire to kill and create, to love and hate."

"And yet, he exists, and furthermore, his existence nullifies the suppressive nature that life and death exert on each other."

Shang wasn't entirely clear about the Lightning Emperor's statement and sought clarification, asking, "What do you mean by that?"

With a sigh, the Lightning Emperor responded, "I'm uncertain about his goal, but I can speculate. It aligns with what Adam and Kali desired."

"When I mentioned that he could learn all level six Concepts, I made a general statement. What I meant was that he would learn all level six Concepts that can be learned," the Lightning Emperor clarified.

"Concepts that can be learned?" Shang repeated. "Does that mean there are level six Concepts that cannot be comprehended?"

The Lightning Emperor nodded. "The level five Concept of Death is known as the Concept of Exodus. It pertains to genocide. One can only comprehend it by causing the death of a vast number of people and immersing oneself in Death Mana."

"When Death Mana becomes sufficiently dense, it undergoes a qualitative transformation, becoming even more extreme and powerful. Kali mentioned feeling as if she was being pulled into the afterlife by ghosts."NnÃªw n0vel chapters are published on n0v/e/(lb)i(n.)co/m

Shang recalled a similar sensation when the Judgment Palace attempted to kill him by creating a Pit of Death.

"In contrast, the level five Concept of Life is known as the Concept of Birth, signifying the creation of an entirely new species."

Shang's intuition kicked in, and he had a reasonable guess regarding the nature of the level six Concepts.

"The Concepts related to the Death Affinity follow a straightforward trajectory. They progress from life to death until the level four Concept, after which they broaden in scope. The level four Concept represents a single death, while the level five Concept represents countless millions of deaths," the Lightning Emperor explained.

"No one has ever managed to grasp the level six Concept of Death, not even Kali. The reasons are apparent."

Shang nodded in understanding. "If someone did, we wouldn't be alive right now."

The Lightning Emperor also nodded. "We Emperors are fairly certain that the level six Concept of Death represents the end of life for an entire world. Every human, beast, plant, and everything else would perish, leaving behind a world saturated with Death Mana, devoid of Life Mana."

"Without the presence of Life Mana, the Death Mana would continue to expand until it encompasses everything. We believe that this is the moment when someone can comprehend the level six Concept of Death."

"Similarly, the level six Concept of Life would involve the transformation of a lifeless world into a thriving one. Since our world isn't dead, we cannot comprehend this Concept."

"Furthermore, if Kali were to attempt to comprehend the level six Concept of Death, she would need to kill Adam, rendering him unable to comprehend the level six Concept of Life since he would be deceased."

"And given that the level six Concept of Life necessitates the absence of death, it is likely that Adam would need to kill Kali, representing death itself."

"Of course, none of us desire for Kali to bring about the destruction of the entire world, and I don't believe she wants that either. Although she may appear emotionless, she is still alive, and apart from the birth of that child, she has shown no signs of creative power. She understands that a dead world would mean her own demise."

At this point, the Lightning Emperor furrowed his brow, indicating a concern.

"But the child is different. He embodies both life and death, representing them both."

"He can annihilate all life in the world, comprehend the level six Concept of Death, and subsequently create an entirely new world by grasping the level six Concept of Life."

"Like I said, I'm uncertain about his goal or his personality, but I can envision that this is what he desires."
