Chapter 408 – Deliberation

King Skythunder only continued smirking. “You’ve been quite lucky to catch a glimpse of her in real life. I still didn’t have the pleasure,” he said.

The Council, the Archduke, Duke Whirlwind, and George were all shocked.

The first two were shocked since King Skythunder had basically confirmed that Shang wasn’t lying, while the second two were shocked that King Skythunder actually knew this powerful Mage.

“She’s the Starlight Queen,” King Skythunder said.

The Council furrowed their brows. They hadn’t heard of such a queen before.

But when Shang heard the word queen, he realized the deeper meaning.

The meaning of King and Queen in the outside world was different from here.

Here, being a King meant having a Kingdom.

But on the outside, it represented a Realm.

For a short moment, Shang wrung with himself.

Should he ask or not?

In the end, he decided to ask.

“Queen, as in like the Ice King?” he asked.

The Council grew more confused. They also didn’t know of an Ice King.

A look of interest and surprise entered King Skythunder’s eyes. “Can you describe this Ice King to me?” he asked.

Shang nodded and described the appearance of the Ice King, the powerful lion he had fought.

“Interesting,” King Skythunder said after listening to Shang. “You seem to have come in contact with quite some high-ranking existences. Yes, Queen, as in similar to the Ice King.”

Shang knew what that meant.

This meant that the Starlight Queen was one of the most powerful Mages in the entire world!

“Continue,” King Skythunder said. “I’m interested in your story now.”

Shang didn’t dare to ask how King Skythunder knew of the Starlight Queen and the Ice King.

Over the next couple of minutes, Shang told them about what he had experienced in the Grandmountain Kingdom. Naturally, he didn’t go into detail on the unimportant parts.

It was a shortened version of what Shang had told the Inquisitor.

But there was one addition.

One day, Shang was visited by an extremely powerful and mysterious man who took an interest in him due to his Battle-Strength as a mere physi.

King Skythunder asked for a description of the man, and Shang described the God. Shang never spoke of the truth regarding the God’s existence and only called him a mysterious but powerful man.

“He doesn’t sound familiar,” King Skythunder said.

Shang nodded.

He had already expected that.

There was probably not a single person alive aside from Shang, George, and Duke Whirlwind who knew of the God. Oh, and that one Mage in the Magic Purity Kingdom.

Shang told King Skythunder how that man had put him through a trial. He had to fight several beasts to prove his power.

At one point, after Shang had defeated a blue lioness, the powerful man told Shang that this species was the mate of the Ice King. Sadly, he couldn’t get one of the Ice King’s children to fight Shang.

“And after I defeated the lioness, he handed me the Star Map,” Shang said. “He said he is interested in seeing the warriors become more powerful. He called the current state of affairs boring.”

“I’ve been using this technique for a couple of years now, and it has helped me immensely in my progress. I don’t think it is fake,” Shang said.

Right now, the Council was frustrated and confused. They had never heard of these kinds of existences.

“Interesting,” King Skythunder said as he looked at the book in his hands. “It seems like someone that shouldn’t have gotten involved got involved.”

King Skythunder remained quiet for a couple of seconds while contemplating something.

“I can tell you all that this technique is genuine,” he said.

When the Council heard that, it was like their world had broken down.

It was actually real?!

But how?!

At that moment, King Skythunder’s smirk returned. “After all, this isn’t the only Star Map.”

At that moment, Shang, George, and Duke Whirlwind also looked at King Skythunder in shock.

“It isn’t?” Duke Whirlwind asked.

King Skythunder nodded. “Yes, but I can’t elaborate on it right now.”

The book in King Skythunder’s hand vanished as he looked at the people in his hall.

“The meeting ends now,” he said. “I can’t make a decision on this matter at this very moment. Let’s just say it needs further deliberation.”

None of the people present were happy about hearing this.

The Council wanted to ban that technique and kill everyone that knew about it, while the three visitors wanted to know if they could survive or not. After all, if the technique was regarded as forbidden or something similar, Shang and George might very well lose their lives.

However, none of them dared to object.

“Until I say otherwise, Shang, George, and Jerald are not to be attacked,” King Skythunder said as he looked at the Council.

The Council politely bowed to the King.

Then, King Skythunder looked at the three visitors. “You may leave. I will let Jerald know about my decision.”

“Thank you, King Skythunder,” the three of them said with a respectful bow.

The group dispersed, leaving King Skythunder alone inside his halls.

For several minutes, King Skythunder only continued sitting on his throne.

Eventually, he left his castle and walked over to a nearby hill.

He sat down and looked at his Kingdom for a while.

Then, he took out a Communication Crystal that looked very different from the normal ones.

It was purple, and there was a lightning bolt in the middle of it.

“You might want to come here for a second,” he said. “I’ve found something very interesting.”

King Skythunder put the crystal away again and looked at the Skythunder Zone.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

A couple of minutes later, someone landed a couple of meters away from him.

“Is there anything you need?” the Supervisor asked with a bored tone. He wasn’t a big fan of going somewhere just because one of his employees wanted him to come.

However, King Skythunder never contacted him, which meant that this had to be something important.

King Skythunder didn’t look at him and only summoned a book.

Then, he threw it over.

“Look what I’ve found floating around in my Kingdom,” he said.

The Supervisor looked at the book with furrowed brows and read it.

After just a short moment, his eyebrows rose in surprise.

“Someone adapted the Star Map for physis?”
