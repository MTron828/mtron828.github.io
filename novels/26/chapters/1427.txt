Chapter 1430 1430. Bored

Noah had his reasons to come out of the cave. He had never liked to remain in a safe place for too long since it was easier to improve when facing adversities. Also, his last project required him to explore the Immortal Lands.

The red crystals obtained in the Evolution Pit could improve his companions since they carried features similar to his black hole. They weren’t an organ that could benefit every function of his existence, but they could perform the same purification.

Noah didn’t dare to test them on his companions right away. Night, Snore, and the Demonic Sword were a core aspect of his superior battle prowess. He was already stronger than an average hybrid, but the three creatures brought his might far beyond what a single existence at his level could wield.

They were one of the main reasons why he could seize benefits where others ran away. Risking their structure with materials that he didn’t fully understand was idiotic.

Noah had decided to create a new blood companion to test the red crystals, but he had yet to find a specimen that met his standards. The octopus-like magical beasts of the Void Zone were creatures with a darkness aptitude, but their base strength didn’t make them a suitable choice.

The best approach to solve his issue was to explore the Immortal Lands, especially the magical beasts’ domain. The current political situation was also in Noah’s favor since most of the stronger creatures were either fighting on the border with the human part or settling in the conquered lands.

Noah would usually leave right away, but he knew that the two hybrids would follow him. Hence, he decided to wait on the surface for them to exit their improvised habitations and join him as he resumed the exploration of those lands.

As for King Elbas, Noah didn’t know what to do with him. He had initially thought that the Royal would leave in that period, but his habitation was still there. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Don and Jordan quickly noticed that Noah had left his cave, and they sent him mental messages where they explained their status. After a brief conversation, they agreed to set off in a week, enough time for them to complete that training session.

Noah rested on the azure ground during those days. He didn’t cultivate and enjoyed that short break from his constant training. His mind naturally wandered among the various projects that had kept him busy inside the cave, but he didn’t linger on them too much.

His period of seclusion had been quite effective. His personal arts had improved again, and he had reached a decent level of expertise with the Shadow Domain. Only the "embodiment of power" still caused issues, but Noah had taken a few steps forward at least.

The issue with the "embodiment of power" was that the four energies didn’t provide superior power output in their mixed form. Beating the dark matter in that field was a challenging task that they didn’t manage to complete.

Alchemy wasn’t even Noah’s strong point. He knew energies, but he was clueless about the many processes and possibilities of that field.

Truth be told, Noah wasn’t sure whether an alchemy master could do better than him in his task. Mixing four energies to create something more powerful than all of them was hard. It required far more than experience in a field that had similarities with that process.

Don and Jordan eventually came out of their habitations and joined Noah in his rest. Still, the group soon stood up to leave when everyone felt to have dispersed the stress accumulated during that long training.

However, as the trio was about to leave, the door of King Elbas’ habitation slammed open, and the Royal came out wearing a satisfied smile that expressed how fulfilled he felt.

Noah didn’t know how to behave with King Elbas. He didn’t know what the Royal wanted to do, but he wouldn’t offer him to come along them. They might have worked together in the Void Zone, but that short mission didn’t change the fact that Noah didn’t trust him.

Noah limited himself to perform a polite nod before setting off and turning in the direction of the Outer Lands on the side of the magical beasts’ domain.

’Other cities of the Legion should be there,’ Noah thought as he picked a direction that would lead him deeper into the magical beasts’ domain.

Don and Jordan quickly followed him in the air, but they all turned when they sensed that a fourth presence had appeared behind them.

King Elbas flew behind the trio without even looking at them. His attention was on the lands below, and his curiosity flared whenever something claimed his interest.

Noah and the others exchanged a glance before resuming their flight, but King Elbas continued to follow them. The Royal didn’t even talk with them. He simply moved along, slowing down and accelerating whenever they changed their pace.

"Why are you following us?" Noah eventually asked after he stopped and turned toward the Royal.

"I have been in peace for too long," King Elbas replied before falling silent.

"This doesn’t explain anything," Noah continued.

"My potential will dwindle if I keep isolating myself to study materials or build inscribed items," King Elbas said. "You cause troubles wherever you go. I might as well join you and benefit from your talent."

Noah didn’t even know what to answer. King Elbas wanted to use him as a portable source of problems so that his cultivation level wouldn’t stagnate.

"Don’t tell me that you are bored," Noah tried to mock him, but King Elbas promptly revealed his arrogant smile.

"The exact opposite," King Elbas replied as his eyes darted through the environment. "This place is so full of valuable and interesting materials that I can barely control me. I want to create something whenever I see a tree, and I want to improve my inscription methods every time I kill a beast. I have spent centuries building stuff already."

King Elbas’ explanation was in line with his individuality. His arrogance and curiosity fused to create an insatiable drive that pushed him to perform countless inscriptions.

Noah shared that curse, but only when it came to his power. He could understand the Royal, but the hybrids weren’t as nice as him.

Don revealed a cold expression, and Jordan limited herself to smile. She didn’t need to express her feelings to make King Elbas understand her position.

"You can’t defeat me," King Elbas replied when he saw the hybrids’ reaction. "You might force me to go away, but you will pay a price that you aren’t ready to face."

King Elbas didn’t step down. The trio had a chance to send him away, but they would have to fight him in the process.

That was something that Noah wanted to avoid. King Elbas was like him. His cultivation level didn’t reflect his battle prowess. The Royal’s higher energy was also annoying to deal with, and his expertise made him one of the most resourceful cultivators in the seventh rank.

"Fine, you can follow along," Noah eventually said after a long exchange of stares. "Still, you have to be useful. You will join every battle and use your expertise to improve our travel."
