Chapter 1805 - 1805. Bomb

It took the experts decades, but they eventually prepared everything required for the mission. Noah had completed the experiments with his bomb, and King Elbas had found a way to stabilize the dimensional tunnels long enough to carry the entire group.

Noah’s bomb didn’t require much external energy. He mostly used his dark matter, so he absorbed fuel from the mansion only when his dantian approached an empty state.

The same didn’t apply to King Elbas. The expert’s task was arduous and required him to transform a frail dimensional tunnel into a passage that could lead a large platoon made of peak rank 8 existences through the void.

Noah only needed the weaker world to grow until it could withstand the experts’ pressure. King Elbas’ task required a superior enhancement since the dimensional tunnel had to continue to work once the group stepped inside it.

Shafu’s stashes of energy inevitably shrunk as time went by inside the mansion. Everyone inside the structure required power to cultivate or prepare for the imminent mission, so the dragon had to disperse the energy seized in the last years to favor the seclusion.

Both Noah and King Elbas eventually felt confident in what they had achieved in those years, so the group left the mansion and resumed their journey. The experts felt strange when they heard the large structure talking, but they ignored the matter once King Elbas stored the item inside his space-ring.

The group had grown so used to the void that they barely paid attention to their surroundings anymore. Noah and Sword Saint usually handled the empty creatures during the travel since the formations rarely could keep up with their speed, but King Elbas had come up with a better solution after the time spent inside the mansion.

King Elbas would never admit it, but he had taken inspiration from Shafu to create a troop carrier that could contain multiple experts and feature defenses at the same time.

Of course, King Elbas’ item didn’t have the shape of a magical beast. It was a massive fiery spearhead that featured countless inscriptions on its surface.

Those accepted by King Elbas could stand on the spearhead without suffering from the flames. The magical beasts weren’t an exception. The entirety of the group could stand on that golden metal and rest while the item crossed the void for them.

It would have been perfect if the environment had energy to absorb, but the experts’ condition was already quite ideal. The only issue came from the magical beasts since they would try to eat part of the fiery spear, but Noah only needed to roar to make them stop.

The long travel ended once the flaming spearhead reached a seemingly random spot in the void. King Elbas stored his item and deployed a few tools before taking out his dimensional claws and tearing the fabric of space.

The items had found a sturdy lower plane that contained many peak rank six existences. They had even confirmed that the dimensional tunnel was still in place, so the group could start their plan right away.

Noah disappeared as he entered the Shadow Domain and expanded it until he reached the insides of the weaker world. Those Mortal Lands had the shape of a large planet that featured many powerful living beings, but they were nothing more than ants in his eyes when he inspected them from behind the dark edges of his technique.

Noah expanded the Shadow Domain until he reached the center of the planet. The special bomb left the separate space at that point, and he placed it at the exact center of the area before retreating back outside the crack in the void.

"Is everyone ready?" Noah asked once he came out of the Shadow Domain to face his companions.

Firm nods unfolded in his vision and left Noah no choice but to start the plan right away. He snapped his fingers, and the bomb came out of the Shadow Domain to detonate at the planet’s center.

The bomb still had weak rank 8 items in its external layers, but their purpose was to contain the initial burst of power of his ambition. Noah had made sure that those materials would work against his law. He had found himself unable to keep his creations stable due to the taboos of his existence, but he had solved the issue by placing more restrictions around his dark matter.

The bomb reappeared inside the world’s burning core, and the magma fell apart when it touched the rank 8 metals around the item. That threatening liquid couldn’t even stay in the same area after the divine materials appeared. Most of the planet’s core vanished in less than an instant. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The event caused earthquakes and opened massive cracks. It seemed that the entire planet was about to cave in, but Noah’s bomb activated before the ground could react to the disappearance of its insides.

The sphere of dark matter that replicated Noah’s ambition exploded outward and clashed with the rank 8 metals around it. The sheer might discharged by the higher energy destroyed the materials while losing power in the process.

The ground suddenly stopped falling apart. The planet had lost its insides, but the ambition forced the surface to remain in one place and evolve. The terrain soon gained metallic features before growing in power and crossing the limits of the heroic ranks.

Noah had made sure not to affect the living beings on the planet with his ambition. All the creatures inside the world’s core had died during the appearance of the bomb, but that was a necessary sacrifice that he couldn’t avoid.

Black clouds started to gather around the planet. Heaven and Earth had launched a Worldwide Heaven Tribulation to make sure to eradicate every form of rebellion, and the group outside the separate space couldn’t intervene.

The world was still too weak for them. It required a few more seconds under the effects of Noah’s ambition to reach a decent state.

The Worldwide Tribulation raged while the experts waited outside of the crack and inspected the scene. Heaven and Earth wanted to get rid of all life on that world, but they found themselves unable to pierce the black patches that had filled the planet.

Every living being on the planet chose to hide under those reinforced spots. Noah’s group had unleashed a catastrophe on them, but they did their best to survive.

The white layer flickered once the world started to approach the seventh rank in terms of overall materials. The restraints meant to isolate those Mortal Lands appeared powerless in front of their newfound power, and they started to shatter in front of the apocalypse.

The separate space began to collapse once the world crossed the seventh rank. Noah and the others could only exchange a nod before stepping inside the area and hope that everything worked.
