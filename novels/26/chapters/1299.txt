Chapter 1301 1301. Black hole

Noah’s dantian shrunk after the energy released by Heaven filled its insides. His darkness boiled and released nutrients that his organ absorbed to elevate its level.

The darkness also changed. It had the form of a series of sword-shaped crystals that emitted a dark light before, but it turned into a pitch-black gas after the breakthrough.

The gas appeared made of a sharp substance that didn’t radiate any light. The power that it contained was immense, and a sense of completeness filled Noah once that energy began to interact with the other centers of power.

Meanwhile, part of the energy released by Heaven flew high in the sky and opened a large crack. White light filled the insides of that fissure, and a captivating aura came out of it as it spread through the world.

The path for the Immortal Lands was open. Noah only had to cross the crack to reach the higher plane and leave his world.

His mind memorized the peculiar aura seeping out of the crack and made him able to see past the world’s structure. Noah could see the void everywhere, but something similar to a dimensional tunnel grew behind the white crack.

That was a striking difference in the other side of the world’s fabric. That tunnel wasn’t something that everyone could see. It was as if the plane had given Noah access to that structure now that he had defeated the Heaven Tribulation.

’That’s how they do it,’ Noah thought as he memorized the position of that tunnel. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Divine cultivators rarely used the first fissure to reach the higher plane. They opened paths for the Immortal Lands on their own after they had handled all the matters in the lower plane.

Noah had always wondered about the theory behind that process, but the answer turned out to be simpler than he expected. Divine cultivators could recognize the entrances to the Immortal Lands placed by Heaven and Earth.

’Did I forget something?’ Noah thought as he focused on his new power.

He had finally become a complete god. Noah had overcome all the Tribulations and reached the real peak of the world.

The aura that he released fixed the many cracks created by his battle against Heaven. Dark patches appeared in the sky and ground to improve the world’s stability and bring its fabric into a superior realm.

Everything slowly calmed down, but Noah soon understood what he had forgotten. It was enough for him to see his darkness moving on its own toward his black hole to recall that his breakthrough would bring.

His rank 7 darkness flowed out of his dantian and entered the black hole. The dark matter inside the fourth center of power became unstable after the arrival of the new material.

Noah sensed something breaking inside him. The spherical form taken by the black hole opened, and flares of dark matter came out of the organ as his higher energy began to evolve.

The black hole began to expand, and Noah promptly shot in the sky. The world could barely endure the power released when he only had two centers of power in the divine ranks. Noah didn’t know what would happen with four.

Flares of dark matter shot out of his chest and pierced everything in their path. They even dug deep fissures in the few remaining patches of the seabed.

Noah knew that he couldn’t suppress that energy. The dark matter was evolving, and he had to complete the process if he wanted to bring it back to a decent shape.

However, Noah lacked darkness now, so he didn’t know if he would have to wait for a while before he could condense the black hole. He could only hope that the process wouldn’t be troublesome.

More dark matter came out of Noah’s chest. That dense black energy began to rotate once enough of it accumulated around his figure.

A massive vortex formed in the sky, but flares still shot out of his figure and thickened the structure. The whirlpool slowly transformed into a giant star that kept enlarging as the black hole emptied its reserves of energy.

The entirety of Noah’s dark matter came out of his body and took the shape of a black star that threatened to become as big as the Mortal Lands. Noah didn’t know how to stop that process. He had some experience in the field, but that breakthrough was completely different since it featured divine darkness.

The sky turned dark as the massive star continued to grow. It stopped enlarging only when it had reached a size similar to half of the world.

The star remained quiet at that point. It stopped enlarging, but flares still came out of its unstable figure. That mass of energy couldn’t stay in the open.

Noah observed the behavior of his higher energy. Dark matter continued to fill the dark star, but that structure didn’t shrink yet. He could only wait for something to happen.

His darkness was no more, but the dark matter devoured anything that it swept in its destructive might, and the dark star enlarged as a consequence.

Noah waited. He knew that he couldn’t force the transformation unless he had more dark matter, but he was also aware that the dark star would find the path to become stable. It was a part of Noah’s existence, so it could react to specific lines.

Shockwaves spread through the entire patch of sky occupied by the dark star. The dark matter felt angry about its new form, but it continued to rotate as it waited to return inside Noah’s body.

Materials, laws, water, and air converged toward the black star that absorbed them to gain some fuel. Noah’s higher energy then destroyed them and made them part of the main technique.

Noah had to remain inside the dark star for a while before he saw some changes. The black star began to shrink after it managed to convert enough materials into part of its structure.

The massive, uneven star slowly shrunk back into Noah’s chest and took the spot of his fourth center of power. It remained a spherical lump of energy, but It had a rotating vortex that divided it in half now.

Noah’s fourth center of power had become an unstable star cut in half by a black hole. It would reach true stability only after replacing all the materials picked along the road with real darkness.

Flares still came out of his chest from time to time, but Noah learnt to sense them. He soon understood how to interrupt them with his mental energy, but he didn’t give them too much attention since he would fix the issue quickly.

The main problem in that transformation was the lack of darkness inside Noah’s dantian. He had just advanced to the seventh rank, so his organ was empty after the small amount of energy from before triggered the transformation of the black hole.

Cultivating wasn’t an option since his training depended on his Demonic Sword. Noah couldn’t train his dantian as long as his living weapon remained in the heroic ranks. He needed the blade to advance before it could reassemble the energy that it absorbed into divine darkness.
