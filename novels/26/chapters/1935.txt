Chapter 1937 1937. Abilities

King Elbas remained silent in front of that tempting offer. The aspects of a law usually had limits since they covered only powers directly connected to each existence. For example, Noah’s understanding of destruction was deep, but it couldn’t compare to the death dragon since the creature was born to carry all the laws connected to that true meaning.

"That might hurt us all," King Elbas immediately stated. "It can work for you due to your unique existence, but each improvement will slow down your journey. Also, you have to make sure to keep everything connected to your ambition and don’t stray away from your path."

"I know the risks," Noah commented, "But what can we do? Heaven and Earth have armies amassed throughout eras, and we can’t hope in another Sword Saint. I’ve seen them ignoring a solid stage cultivator as if he were nothing more than a pawn meant to die. How much power do you think they hold?"

"We are the best experts who have ever walked on these lands," King Elbas proudly announced. "Each one of us will be as strong as ten of them once we reach the peak." Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

"What if they have hundreds of disposable assets?" Noah asked. "What if they get too scared and kick us of the sky before we can become a real danger?"

"What are you even suggesting?" King Elbas replied. "We have always known how difficult it was. That’s why we are pushing our limits past every reasonable level."

"I’m just saying that it might not be enough," Noah sighed. "The next time Heaven and Earth throw a solid stage cultivator at us, we are dead. We need to be more."

"We risk becoming Heaven and Earth with your plan," King Elbas complained.

"That’s the point," Noah explained while standing up. "You don’t have to accept anything unless you find it suitable for your existence. Moreover, we wouldn’t take Heaven and Earth’s path. They need many laws to become a world, but we must remain loyal to our true meanings. Deepening our aspects is the only way to increase our potential."

Noah believed in those words. He had decided to push his ethereal blackness to be more than his centers of power would have initially built for that same reason. Heaven and Earth were too strong, and even the best among the best couldn’t face them.

The same weakness that Noah believed to have afflicted his companions. They were strong, incredibly so, but they remained existences. His group counted seven experts now that Robert had died. They would probably become the best warriors the world had ever seen, but they remained seven against an uncountable army.

Noah had considered every option, and victory was achievable. In the best option, his group would manage to make Heaven and Earth lose a lot of power, continue to defeat their punishments, and bring all their enemies together in a grand final battle. The other view saw the rulers finding a way to ignore their fairness and throwing something too strong for them.

Noah didn’t want to rely on others, but he acknowledged when he had to compromise. He couldn’t win on his own, but the dragons and the monster outside the sky were unreliable. If possible, he preferred to rely only on his companions, but that meant that they had to become stronger than the other potential allies.

However, existences had limits that everyone built throughout their cultivation journey. Even someone like Noah had found himself feeling short of power when he found himself in front of the ninth rank. The others had to be worse than him, and he couldn’t ignore that issue.

King Elbas could only heave a sigh when Noah’s explanation ended. His leader wasn’t wrong, but everything felt too unreasonable. Even his path had turned into a mad search for something that he had only gazed at once.

"We don’t have much to do anyway," King Elbas eventually announced. "Finding opponents is what we do. Maybe we’ll find something that we can’t refuse and join your crazy plan. How confident are you that it won’t affect our journey?"

"I have no idea," Noah shrugged his shoulders, and his gesture left King Elbas speechless. "I only tried with Robert’s existence, but he doesn’t count since he is a child of my dark matter. I wanted to test everything after learning about the hydra, but alas."

"Get out and don’t come back unless you have clear data!" King Elbas shouted.

"It will work," Noah promised while walking outside the training hall and waving his hand.

King Elbas shook his head once Noah finally left alone. He felt pissed after going through that long discussion when Noah was only going over his ideas. Yet, his thought eventually went on his impossible project, and he found himself staring at the golden jelly.

King Elbas had relied on the understanding contained inside the life sphere to move forward in his experiment. He would have probably reached similar results if he spent enough time studying those laws, but the first process was simply faster. The difference in terms of millennia of training would be immense.

An idea that King Elbas instinctively tried to suppress spread through his mind at some point. His existence might not be enough to concoct the final energy. That power could be something that simple existences shouldn’t reach.

Noah wore a cold expression while he moved toward the training hall. He didn’t speak about his idea to King Elbas randomly. The expert had often helped him understand if his ambition was leading him astray. Noah needed a second opinion, and he had obtained it. He only needed to prove King Elbas right now.

Noah reached his training area in no time. His hall was dark, reinforced with every type of shield that King Elbas could imagine. It could also expand at will since the expert had tuned it with Noah’s understanding of space. It was basically a separate dimension that didn’t need to leave the actual world.

His mind had already decided where to start. Noah currently had three foreign techniques in his mind belonging to Supreme Thief, Isaac, and Shandal. They appeared suitable for some aspects of his law and his general true meaning. In theory, he could already improve his existence.

’Slow and steady,’ Noah thought while sitting at the center of his training hall. ’Just like I hate it.’

Noah had time to test a few projects while his companions recovered, and he didn’t hesitate to approach that pressing idea. His focus converged on Shandal’s ability, and its functioning unfolded in his mind. His understanding of time had long since become good enough to study the differences in the laws that his existence and Shandal had approached during their journeys.

The actual effects of Shandal’s ability involved the halting of time in a small area, while Noah’s understanding focused on bending it. They belonged to the same field of laws, but they were pretty different. Still, Shandal’s ability was raw, basic, and Noah had even needed to complete it back then.

Supreme Thief’s ability activated and used its effects on Shandal’s understanding. Noah could study that power in ways he had never done before, but everything felt too weak. He barely noticed when his mind threw those ideas in his aspect of time.

Noah didn’t feel different either after the absorption. He had gained a vague idea, but he would have to expand his understanding to bring its power to the ninth rank

His focus went on his remaining two skills at that point. Supreme Thief’s ability involved his greed, hunger, and pride, while Isaac’s technique would affect his pride and his ambition as a whole. Noah needed to pick one of them to see what to fuse with his existence first, but even his mind couldn’t find a perfect answer.
