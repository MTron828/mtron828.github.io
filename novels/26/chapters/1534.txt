Chapter 1535 1535. Frui

Noah flew through the region as lumps of dark matter flowed out of his draconic armor. The black hole quickly fixed his transformation, but his expression remained grim.

Two rank 8 Eternal Snakes were looking at him. The only existence in Noah’s group that could fight those creatures was the rank 8 Foolery, but it was busy with the other two leaders. Noah couldn’t have one versus one battles in that situation.

The other two packs were slithering at full speed toward the battlefield. It wouldn’t take them much to join their companions and surround Noah’s group.

Noah was at a loss of what to do. Even escaping seemed impossible in that situation. His ambition would eventually run out if the Eternal Snakes didn’t stop targeting him.

’I must kill them,’ Noah concluded in his mind.

Noah had a different tactic in mind, but that approach was a gamble. He didn’t know how the Eternal Snakes would react. It was better to pursue his simple strategy for now since it had yet to fail.

’Two at the same time,’ Noah thought while inspecting the battlefield. ’I don’t know if I can handle them.’

Snore could theoretically help, but Noah didn’t want to risk losing the advantage created with his sudden assault. The same went for Duanlong. The two Blood Companions were taking care of the ice, which was the most crucial task in that battle. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The two Eternal Snakes leapt toward Noah, but he teleported away before they could reach him. He reappeared among the rest of his troops, right in the middle of the battlefield.

’It’s your turn,’ Noah thought while looking at his right palm. ’Try not to kill me.’

Noah’s ambition flowed inside the Demonic Form, and a wide array of roots pierced his palm to expand in the sky. The corrosive aura that they radiated dimmed the white light and forced most of his underlings to run away.

The two Eternal Snakes didn’t care about that threatening aura. Noah had already inflicted unforgivable losses to their pack. They would continue to attack him even if their bodies ended up burning in the process.

Noah turned toward the two leaping leaders. The Snakes were far weaker than usual without the ice, especially when it came to their movement. He could easily teleport on top of one of the creatures and place his palm on its head.

A sense of weakness filled his centers of power as the roots spread and entangled themselves on the Snake’s head. They covered its neck and used their corrosive aura to pierce its thick scales.

The Snake hissed in pain when the roots spread through the insides of its body. The other leader wanted to come in its aid, but a large cut suddenly opened on its left eye and interrupted its charge.

Noah didn’t hesitate to point his blades at the dark-green scales. His blades slowly pierced the creature. Once their tip reached the beast’s muscles, they released a wave of energy that opened a large cavity inside its head.

The Demonic Form quickly expanded in that cavity and continued its destruction, and Noah felt temporarily relieved after the plant consumed those tissues. The more it absorbed, the less it ate from his body.

’Another one!’ Noah shouted inside his mind before pointing his blades again.

The swords pierced the dark-green scales and prepared to launch an attack fueled by Noah’s ambition, but the other leader managed to slam on his figure.

Noah revealed a surprised expression after focusing on the second Eternal Snake. Night had severed both its eyes during that short exchange. It had managed to sense him only through its instincts.

The roots had broken in the impact, but they remained materials with high corrosive properties. They continued to destroy the Snake from the inside until they depleted their power.

’Can’t you give me more?’ Noah asked through the mental connection.

The plant ignored Noah, but he promptly lowered his barriers. The black hole allowed the Demonic Form to eat more of Noah’s power and gave it the chance to grow while his ambition fueled its existence.

The array of roots inside Noah’s chest thickened, and the flower slowly closed to give birth to a fruit. Noah quickly seized it through the dark world, and his figure disappeared again.

Noah reappeared above the Snake that had suffered from his attacks. It didn’t have the chance to heal without the ice, so it still featured a large cut on its head.

A wave of pain invaded Noah’s mind, but he ignored it. He dived toward the injury and stabbed his hand inside it. When he released his grasp, the fruit entered the Snake’s body and dispersed its corrosiveness through its head.

Noah teleported high in the sky when he sensed the arrival of the second leader. The pain didn’t stop after he got rid of the fruit. His eyes fell on the source of that sensation, where he saw that both his hand and his white blade had suffered heavy damage.

’I didn’t even hold it with my real hand!’ Noah cursed in his mind.

The influence of the fruit had partially destroyed the white sword’s handle, and his right hand had lost a few fingers. His two additional right arms had regrown, but the fruit had managed to destroy them before. It didn’t even spare the copies of the blade.

Noah thought about that issue only for an instant. His injuries proved that the fruit corrosive’s power was off the chart. His eyes instinctively went on one of his targets, and he saw that the creature was slamming its head on the ground in a desperate attempt to get rid of its pain.

The other Eternal Snake couldn’t do much. It was blind, and Night had never stopped attacking it. Its body was too huge for the Pterodactyl to inflict severe injuries, but the companion still covered it with wounds.

Noah withdrew his ambition from the plant and restored the limitations around it. He felt a bit surprised about the actual destructiveness of the fruit, but he welcomed that discovery happily.

The Eternal Snake convulsed on the ground. Its huge body crushed the terrain during its struggles. Yet, the creature couldn’t do anything against a weapon that was already inside its mind.

Its situation would be different if it had its ice, but Noah’s Blood Companions were taking care of that. Duanlong’s innate ability was so powerful that even the Eternal Snakes fighting against Noah couldn’t accumulate that material around them.

The Snake never stopped struggling, but Noah and the roots had inflicted too much damage on its insides. The fruit only had vital organs left to destroy once it entered its head. The creature remained alive for an entire minute before exhaling its last breath.

’Did it really die?’ Noah wondered before a sense of weakness invaded his mind and made him lose his foothold.

Noah quickly straightened his position and flew toward the massive corpse. The body of the leader entered his separate space, but Noah’s expression remained grim.

The Demonic Form had absorbed too much of his power. His ambition was also fueling his other assets. It wouldn’t take much before the drawbacks arrived.

Still, Noah couldn’t do anything about that. He didn’t even think about that topic. He had managed to kill one of his opponents, so he had to take care of the other leader to gain his chance to escape.
