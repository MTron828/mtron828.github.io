Chapter 1787 - 1787. Sharpness

Every expert involved with the mission outside the sky began to work on their tasks. Most of them only needed to increase their cultivation level as much as possible and polish their abilities. Still, others had to prepare actual tools and techniques vital for the journey.

King Elbas became the busiest existence in the entire organization, and only Noah came close to him. The former had to prepare countless items while cooperating with specific experts to create perfect counters for various dangers outside the sky. Instead, Noah had to summon the different leaders of every magical beast pack and force them to work together.

The upper tier magical beasts didn’t like to abandon their packs. Most of them relied on their underlings to express their real power and preserve their lives, but they had to follow Noah’s orders since the mission didn’t exist without him.

Noah disregarded the creatures that were useless without their pack. He preferred to leave them on the landmass as potential allies against eventual rebels instead of bringing a noisy horde in the mission.

Gathering the magical beasts was only the first of his vital tasks. Noah had to join King Elbas afterward and help him with the special defenses that relied on his sharpness. Sword Saint also took part in that procedure, and the trio soon came up with great countermeasures to the empty existences.

The years passed, and everyone slowly approached their best condition. The various tools required with the mission also reached a complete state. No one thought that the time would really come, but the truth was that they would leave soon at that pace.

The time eventually arrived, and the various experts gathered on the other side of the black landmass to review the plan one last time.

King Elbas and Noah had explored the path through a different hole before the gathering. They had followed Caesar’s advice and had gone to the other side of the higher plane to find suitable targets.

Their exploration turned out to be quite fruitful. Caesar had spoken the truth. The areas revealed after piercing the void on the other side of the higher plane were different. They still had layers of whiteness meant to isolate lower worlds, but they also featured special zones with a far more powerful light.

It was clear that those powerful white layers didn’t only contain Mortal Lands since Heaven and Earth wouldn’t waste so much energy to isolate lower worlds. There had to be something valuable there, something that could go past the weaker light, which was exactly what Noah wanted.

The two had even tested the entirety of King Elbas’ items and had prepared the area for the mission. They didn’t leave anything on the other side of the sky due to the presence of the empty creatures, but its insides were a safe space that could hold some of the tools and inscriptions while everyone finished preparing.

The final layout of the group featured Noah’s friends, a few cultivators from the old human organizations, and many upper tier magical beasts. It was a strange team that released massive waves of power in the environment and that even Noah could barely control.

Alexander, Sword Saint, Wilfred, Divine Demon, Robert, and Steven were solid stage experts that Noah didn’t need to keep in check since they followed their orders out of respect for his authority. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

However, Elsie and the three cultivators in the solid stage who had decided to join the mission still had some doubts, and their loyalty toward Noah mostly depended on the black landmass.

That feature was inevitable since the four experts had yet to spend a lot of time under Noah’s rule. Still, they understood the severity of the situation, and they agreed with him when it came to the plans that could fix it.

The magical beasts in the team were harder to control. The Foolery tried to act as a bridge between the loyal side and those creatures, but the pig didn’t belong to their kind anymore after Noah’s enhancements. Its level had also remained in the liquid stage, which made most of the pack leaders look down on it.

Noah had to release his pride constantly to make sure that those magical beasts didn’t fall prey to their anger or instincts. They were hungry beasts that had begun to regret leaving their valuable lairs to return to that emptiness. Knowing that their targets were in the void only worsened their annoyance.

Yet, the strange group remained united, and no major complaints echoed among them. The mission could finally start, and tension inevitably acc.u.mulated among the team after they left their safe spot on the landmass and flew toward the hole that King Elbas had marked previously.

Noah had to lead the group to inspire them and make them disperse their worries. His role in the frontlines would force him to face more dangers, but Alexander, Sword Saint, and Robert didn’t let him alone.

The four led the group through a tunnel in the sky and entered the immense void. Everyone gathered there at that point, but the experts had to wait among the blackness since King Elbas had to prepare a few tools for the other side of the sky.

King Elbas used his golden rocks to create a membrane above the sky that stopped its abilities. Golden patches slowly covered the edges of the hall before many different items appeared on them.

Noah recognized the quasi-rank 9 flags and the inscriptions fueled by black cans that contained a dense liquid created with King Elbas. However, they were only a tiny part of the storm of items that the expert was throwing on the golden patches.

King Elbas activated sensors, screens, flares, defenses, trackers, and beams meant to signal the hole’s location. Most of those items were in the upper tier of the eighth rank, and only the quasi-rank 9 flags went beyond that level.

The wait among the blackness forced the experts to spread part of their influence through the environment. That worked as bait for the many creatures hidden among the void, but they expected as much.

Noah and the others saw the void bending toward them while creating sharp spikes that threatened to pierce their bodies. Yet, King Elbas’ defenses activated at that point, and a series of black and silver slashes suddenly materialized inside those attacks.

King Elbas could replicate certain attacks, but he preferred to pursue a different approach. He stored the attacks of his companions and connected them to a series of sensors that could notice even the slightest movements inside the void.

Moreover, King Elbas had added a unique feature to some of his sensors. The empty creatures were peculiar, but they had weaknesses, and he could exploit them.

His sensors launched sharp waves of energy through the void and studied their reactions. The empty creatures couldn’t slip past those powers, so they inevitably revealed their position and allowed the entire group to focus on them.

A slash appeared in the void whenever the empty creatures revealed themselves. The inscriptions even dealt with the morphing of that blackness and allowed Noah and the others to proceed.

The group inspected how well everything worked, and they felt gladly surprised that King Elbas didn’t mess up anything. The inscriptions worked perfectly, and the defenses were on point even.

Noah and Sword Saint decided to fill the environment with their sharpness while they waited for King Elbas to create a path across the void. The expert calmly waved his strange clawed weapon and used it to make an opening that led to the separate dimensions.

Whiteness immediately flew out of the crack, but Noah didn’t care about it. He peeked inside the gap and made sure that nothing happened before crossing the fissure with his whole body and ending up in a foreign environment.

The blinding light of a layer with power near the ninth rank forced the experts to close their eyes, but Noah quickly restored their vision.

His aura darkened the environment and allowed the experts to see a broken planet that sent its boulders toward the whiteness.
