Chapter 1136 1136. Mayhem

King Elbas was in a tough position. His opponents launched a relentless offensive, and the rank 7 titan was an item that he couldn’t stop completely.

He could only rely on his stash of quasi-rank 7 items to limit the titan’s influence on the battlefield.

The golden disks eventually broke while King Elbas deflected and blocked the Matriarchs’ offensive. He took out a quasi-rank 7 phoenix-like puppet at that point, and the creature set off to deal with the titan.

Golden fire surrounded the phoenix as it exchanged blows with the titan. Its efforts allowed King Elbas to gain a few minutes, but the puppet soon crumbled under the might of an actual divine item.

King Elbas threw another quasi-rank 7 phoenix at the titan, and he had another for when the second one fell apart. Once his stash of powerful puppets ended, he began to rely on disposable weapons that pushed Chasing Demon’s giant away.

The three attacking leaders almost couldn’t believe their eyes. King Elbas’ stash of powerful items appeared endless, and a chill ran down their spines when they recalled all the small battles that had happened in the past.

King Elbas must have had that stash for a while by then. Many of those quasi-rank 7 items went back to when he was still a liquid stage powerhouse.

The Royals’ leader was an unparalleled existence. His expertise didn’t have limits, and he had begun to break the barrier among stages since he was only one of the world’s leading forces.

His performance was spectacular. The leaders of the major organizations were deploying everything they had, but he came out unscathed from every clash.

Still, Chasing Demon and the others knew that even his immense potential had limits. King Elbas was a monster, but his stash of powerful items had to end at some point.

Their exchanges continued until a sudden change in the battlefield forced King Elbas to focus elsewhere.

The Royal’s mind covered the entire battlefield, but the titan’s continuous assaults forced him to neglect most of what happened outside of his fight.

The rank 7 titan slammed its fists on a quasi-rank 7 shield that had appeared in the trajectory of its attacks. The item broke, but the giant had to recover its limbs to prepare for its next offensive.

The clash between the two created a shockwave that spread outside of the array of stars. Still, its intensity wasn’t enough to kill the powerhouses fighting outside of it.

King Elbas could finally focus on the entirety of the battlefield again in that moment of break.

The weaker experts were still launching attacks at him, but his fiery swords destroyed them together with God’s Left Hand’s blows. He didn’t even have to mind an offensive on that level.

Then, his focus moved on his underlings, and he felt slightly satisfied with their battle prowess. The Royals’ dense fiery wall surpassed the limits of their stage. It would be foolish not to recognize such an achievement. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

However, his anger surged when he saw that one of the seven stars had disappeared. That large mass of raw laws had been there just a moment ago, but now there was only Noah in its spot.

’Six left,’ Noah thought as a cold smile appeared on his face.

He had to admit that the Royals were strong when they worked together and deployed their inscribed items. Only his lunge could breach their last defensive measure, but he couldn’t waste one of his two attacks for them.

Noah couldn’t use his strongest attacks when he wasn’t sure that the leaders could deal with King Elbas. In case everything else failed, he could still aim to surprise him.

Still, the Royals weren’t an easy target, so he had switched to a less difficult prey. The stars didn’t defend themselves in the end. They were there, begging for someone to absorb them.

Noah didn’t have a particular reason to target the stars. They refilled his dantian and improved his overall condition, but taking them away from King Elbas didn’t help him in the task.

King Elbas only needed to find another way to advance or scour the void for more raw laws. Losing the stars didn’t ruin his potential.

Noah only wanted to make him mad. He didn’t know if those small failures could affect the Royal’s power, but every cultivator would eventually commit mistakes if the pressure became too heavy to handle.

King Elbas had nine experts targeting him with a continuous offensive, and three of them had items that forced him to defend. An angry mental state might make him lose.

Chasing Demon didn’t waste the opportunity created by Noah and poured large quantities of "Breath" inside the titan that spread its aura in the environment.

The Demon paled after that action, but small rocks came out of the titan and gave birth to an army of humanoid puppets that radiated a quasi-rank 7 aura.

The rank 7 titan’s main feature was "life". It suited Chasing Demon’s individuality, allowing him to use less "Breath" when activating its abilities.

The puppets moved slowly and deployed themselves in a battle formation as they pointed their heavy limbs at King Elbas. The titan grabbed a dozen of them and threw the group at the Royal in the distance.

King Elbas wanted to make Noah pay for stealing his resources, but Chasing Demon wasn’t giving him any time to breathe. He had to deal with that expert, but the offensive of the others blocked his every move.

He had to change the trend of that battle. He might end up losing otherwise.

The humanoid puppets reached King Elbas at high speed. Their fists pointed at his face, body, and legs, and some of them aimed for the area around him.

King Elbas had to use his golden shield to block Great Elder Diana’s offensive and his sword to deal with God’s Left hand and the other experts.

His hands were full, but his inventory had everything he needed to block the puppets.

A series of inscribed daggers came out of his space-ring and destroyed the puppets while crumbling shortly after. King Elbas cursed when he evaluated the cost of those lost weapons, but he felt glad that he had managed to defend once again.

His consciousness remained unfolded, but he focused directly on Noah since he knew what type of troublemaker he was. Yet, he found out that another star had disappeared during the last exchange.

Noah didn’t even bother to look at the Royals after he had fed on the first white star. He had directly cast his Demonic Form again, launched a few copies to spread his smoke, and left for more raw laws.

The Royals couldn’t catch up with him, and King Elbas was too busy to mind him. Instead, Noah had the best resource of a lower-plane at hand, and he wouldn’t wait until someone seized it.

Noah improved and refilled his reserves. It only took him a few instants to take all those raw laws and redirect them to the dark star. Only his organ could handle such intense and fast training.

King Elbas couldn’t stand that situation anymore and decided to take the battle toward the next step. He had never been a vicious fighter, but he would be merciless on that day.

Blood fell from the Royal’s fingers, and an unstable flame began to form. Then, the fire expanded until it became a large sphere that shone everywhere in the region.

Power accumulated in that spell, and an explosion soon arrived. The flames shot everywhere, and a fiery sea accompanied it in its destructive might.
