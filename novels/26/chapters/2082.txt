Chapter 2084 Heartwarming

Familiar faces filled Noah's vision, and a smile inevitably appeared on his face. He saw Flying Demon, Dreaming Demon, Faith, Kirk, Jordan, and many other experts he had left behind countless years ago. He felt as if time was flowing backward to bring him back to a different period when the Immortal Lands were something more than a mere mass of sky.

Still, the heartwarming scene lacked what Noah was looking for. He could sense Daniel and Second Prince somewhere on the landmass, but June was absent, and the same went for some magical beasts or experts that he had learnt to know.

"Did the Foolery die?" Noah asked when he failed to sense his old companion. Members of its species still occupied the black landmass, but he couldn't find their leader.

"Is that pig your first thought during our first meeting in ages?" Flying Demon laughed while shooting forward and slamming his palms on Noah's shoulders.

"I missed you too, old friend," Noah announced, uncaring that Flying Demon seemed unable to hold back his affection.

"The Foolery is fine," Dreaming Demon explained while reaching her lover and pulling him away from Noah. "It left after we hid the landmass among the storms. It seemed that living here had bored it, and part of its species followed along."

"You have all grown bold enough to hide this place in the storms," Noah chuckled. "I'm glad."

"Second Prince proved himself useful," Faith exclaimed while approaching Noah and hugging him tightly. "He claims to have surpassed his father every time he invents something new." Findd new ùíîtories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

"He doesn't know what his father is up to," Noah whispered while caressing Faith's shoulder after she broke the embrace.

"Are you the reason behind this mess?" Jordan asked while pointing at the weak sky. "We saw your battle when that black thing invaded the higher plane. I wouldn't be surprised if you were behind all of this."

"Heaven and Earth did everything on their own," Noah exclaimed. "I merely caused the battle."

The reunion left everyone ecstatic, and Noah couldn't hide his satisfaction in front of his friends' cultivation level. They were at the peak of the eighth rank, except for Kirk, who was about to approach the solid stage.

'I've been away for a long time,' Noah thought at the sight of those improvements.

The landmass still radiated his potential, but most of those experts didn't share his talent of growth speed. The sole fact that they had reached their current level stated how long Noah had been away.

"Will you stay?" Kirk asked. "Heaven and Earth aren't holding back with their Tribulations. I'm afraid we need your help."

"You don't know your master if you think he'll remain here," Faith sighed. "I've never seen Noah standing still in his entire life. He can join apocalyptic battles, so I wouldn't be surprised if he were to invade the sky."

"I've been there twice already," Noah revealed. "There's no point going a third time until I find something worth stealing."

The revelation left all the experts in the area speechless. Even Maribel couldn't help but glance at Noah after that statement. The sky was Heaven and Earth's most protected environment, but he was claiming to have visited it twice.

"What exactly did you do during these years?" Flying Demon asked.

"I'll tell you more later on," Noah promised. "Prepare a celebration while I pay Daniel a visit. Make sure to welcome Maribel properly."

No one dared to complain about that decision, and Noah soon found himself with Flying Demon and Jordan escorting him toward a tall castle that stood at the very center of the black landmass. The rest of his friends took care of welcoming Maribel and preparing a party worthy of Noah's return.

The landmass appeared healthier than ever. Multiple environments with clear borders filled its immense surface. Each region had vast settlements, different magical plants, and specific species of magical beasts.

The scene felt quite incredible after considering everything that the landmass had to survive. The sole idea that an area so rich in cultivators, magical beasts, magical plants, and hybrids could exist in the current state of the higher plane was astonishing.

The heartwarming and fantastic state of the black landmass didn't make Noah forget the reason behind his presence there. His eyes wandered among the regions under him as a simple question left his mouth. "Is she dead?"

The mood immediately worsened. Flying Demon and Jordan diverted their gazes when they thought about June. Still, Noah required an answer, so Flying Demon eventually spoke. "The Tribulations have started to fall as soon as the sky filled the entire higher plane. One of them has been so harsh that June decided to drag it away. She didn't come back."

"Daniel can give you more details," Jordan continued. "I'm sure you'll have a lot to discuss."

Noah nodded. Those unclear answers remained annoying, but he didn't blame his friends for them. He only wished to understand June's state to decide how to react.

Flying Demon and Jordan led Noah to the base of the structure, and its immense doors opened as soon as they touched the ground. The two remained outside while Noah strode forward without hesitation.

The many luxurious areas that appeared in his view didn't interest him. Noah blinked, and the scene in his vision transformed. His understanding of space and time easily allowed him to perform a teleport and enter the room occupied by a familiar presence.

An empty bright room unfolded in Noah's vision. White light filled every corner of the area, and the complete absence of furniture made it appear as a pure glowing cube.

Noah's arrival immediately darkened the area and revealed its perfect surfaces. He couldn't see any crack or hole in those old materials. Moreover, the complete lack of odors made him feel as if he had landed in the void.

"Do you have any idea of how long it will take to remove your presence from here?" Daniel asked as he interrupted his training and stood up from the center of the room.

"You should greet your leader," Noah joked.

"You didn't bother with that stuff," Daniel reminded. "Besides, I'm the leader now. You have far more important things to do."

"You did a good job here," Noah admitted while his consciousness fell on Daniel's centers of power. "It seems that your new position has also benefited you."

Daniel was at the peak of the eighth rank, but he appeared close to the breakthrough. Noah even guessed that his friend would be able to reach the ninth rank in the next years.

"I've always been better than you at this," Daniel announced. "My approach doesn't leave anyone behind. I'm selfless."

"How did Faith take that?" Noah joked, and Daniel ended up laughing.

"I admit that it's hard," Daniel stated while walking toward Noah. "We are an odd match, but our existences are starting to create problems."

"Having partners in the cultivation journey is hard," Noah sighed. "Our path almost forces us to be alone."

"That's where the beauty lies, isn't it?" Daniel replied before performing a polite bow. "I've missed you, old friend."

"Me too," Noah smiled. "Being here brings back many memories."

"The same happened when I saw you fighting against those giant hands," Daniel admitted. "I could see the lonely kid who waved his swords at worms during that incredible spectacle."

"Not far enough," Noah whispered.

"Sit with me," Daniel requested while showing a complicated smile‚Ä¶ "I'll tell you what I know about June."
