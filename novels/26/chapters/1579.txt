"Is he serious?" Alexander eventually asked once the awkward silence became unbearable. "Does he always order around existences stronger than him?"

Jordan and Wilfred wanted to deny that statement, but they limited themselves to sigh. Noah could be overbearing at times, but he had brought indisputable benefits to the Legion.

"Let’s talk for a while," Wilfred sighed. "I will tell you who Defying Demon is. You can choose whether to listen to him afterward."

Noah ignored the events happening in the sky. He didn’t care too much about them. Alexander was an incredible existence, but he had to focus on his power and targets.

’I must improve the workshop before searching for the secret organization,’ Noah thought while sitting cross-legged inside his cave. ’I need more trump cards. I can’t rely on the cursed sword as often as before.’

Gloria Sailbrird had shown that she could restrain Noah’s flames. Her actions had proved that the human domain was aware of the healing properties of that innate ability.

Noah couldn’t let his enemies understand the entirety of his arsenal. He always had to be one step ahead to surprise them and seize otherwise impossible victories.

June flew inside the cave a few weeks after his return. The duo talked about the trade with the Balrow family and the events that followed that meeting. Noah didn’t hide anything, and he didn’t hold back to express how lucky he had been with the rank 9 dragon.

"The windy regions sound like a fun place," June said once Noah’s stories ended. "I can’t wait to be strong enough to face those creatures."

"There is a lot that I don’t understand," Noah sighed. "I want to interrogate the secret organization right away, but I’m afraid that my current power isn’t good enough for another exploration of the human domain."

"You never stop placing these impossible standards on your growth," June complained while taking his hands. "Look at yourself. You have reached Divine Demon, you are on the right path for the ninth rank, and the whole human domain fears your potential. Give yourself some time to stabilize your power and improve properly."

"You know that I can’t stop," Noah sighed. "You are also unable to restrain your battle intent. Moreover, I can’t stay put after witnessing that Tribulation. The sole thought that Heaven and Earth can attack at any time is annoying, to say the least."

June understood Noah better than everyone else. She could see the determination in his eyes. Noah would leave those lands as soon as he completed his project, and nothing could make him change his mind.

"Laws can be troublesome," Alexander’s voice suddenly resounded through the cave. "Our species even worsen our condition. Believe me when I say that I understand your unrest."

Alexander slowly materialized inside the cave. The dark matter around the structure couldn’t do anything to stop that ability. Noah was powerless against that expert.

"Can we have a word, leader to leader?" Alexander asked, and June let go of Noah’s hands before walking toward a corner of the cave.

"Wilfred and Jordan told me a bit about you," Alexander continued once he landed in front of Noah. "I bet you don’t care about the Legion, but I can’t deny how much you have helped it. Your victories against the Crystal City are also commendable. You are definitely an ally, even if you tried to order me around."

"You gave me the chance to inspect your aura," Noah said while fixing his eyes on Alexander. "I heard the cries that fill your existence. You need to hunt, so I gave you targets."

"I won’t fight a war for you," Alexander exclaimed.

"Fight it for the Legion then," Noah replied. "You can keep all of them safe for a few years, but your instabilities will return at some point. You have to make sure that the human domain doesn’t dare to attack these lands even after your departure."

Alexander remained silent. Noah’s words made sense, but his pride prevented him from accepting those words so easily. Alexander couldn’t let a weaker hybrid give him orders.

"I can’t accept your orders," Alexander eventually announced, "But we can seal a pact. I can give you the diversion that you need, but I want something in return."

"What can you possibly want from me?" Noah asked.

"It’s pretty simple," Alexander laughed. "The drawbacks of my species will eventually kill me. I managed to survive in the windy regions for so long because I have countless survival instincts fused in my mind, but I will definitely die someday. I want you to promise me that you will take care of the Legion at that point."

Noah’s eyes widened. It was rare for experts at that level to care so much about their organizations. Those powerful existences usually severed their ties with the political world to focus on reaching the ninth rank at that point. Yet, Alexander seemed different.

"I would have done it anyway," Noah answered. "They are allies, and I already consider them part of my pack."

"That’s good to hear," Alexander sighed before standing up. "The human organizations will focus their full firepower on me once they learn about my return. Don’t waste this chance."

Alexander appeared strange. His words resembled a farewell, and Noah almost took pity in that cursed existence.

Alexander was one of the strongest hybrids that Noah had ever met, but his existence was a mess. The expert had amassed so many abilities that his law had begun to vanish under their pressure.

"You know," Noah said while the expert started to become ethereal. "I might be able to find a solution to your drawbacks one day. Try to stay alive until then. I want to add your battle prowess to my organization."

"I thought you wanted to dissect me," Alexander laughed.

"I only hate to waste materials," Noah replied. "You probably are the best rank 8 resource in the world. It’s better to keep you away from the large organizations."

"That might be true," Alexander laughed again before wearing a serious expression. "I will attack as soon as you leave these lands. I will take your friend with me."

Noah nodded, and Alexander vanished. His departure left only June and Noah in the cave, but none of them spoke.

’An existence cursed by the same features that make him amazing,’ Noah thought while trying to imagine Alexander’s life. ’We are similar under some aspects. I wonder if that’s why I want to help him."

Noah had already solved issues connected to the hybrid status. Alexander’s situation was a bit outside of his expertise, but Noah wanted to help him anyway.

"How long will it take you to be ready to go out?" June asked and disrupted the silence.

"Will you come with me?" Noah asked after sensing the meaning behind her question.

"Of course," June replied. "The secret organization has hurt us. I want to vent the feelings accumulated in those years."

"Give me a few decades," Noah said after calculating how much he needed to improve the workshop. "We’ll leave as soon as my technique is complete. We should be quite safe with it."

"Another crazy technique?" June asked while inspecting the waves of dark matter flowing out of his chest.

"You have no idea," Noah explained. "I should become unbeatable after I finish devising this new weapon."
