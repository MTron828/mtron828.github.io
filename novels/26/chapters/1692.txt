Chapter 1694 - 1694. Help

Noah’s dark matter copied the features of his flames and continued to burn the lightning bolts until it reached the source of the Tribulation.

The dark clouds that had gathered in a random spot among the sky burnt under the power carried by Noah’s attack. Their energy then flowed back to his body and healed the injuries caused by the cursed sword.

Noah pressed on until the black clouds completely vanished. His body had almost returned to its peak by then, and only his bloodl.u.s.t still carried traces of his previous battle.

"How does it feel to be an enemy of Heaven and Earth?" Noah asked without turning to look at his new underling.

A sudden dangerous sensation appeared in his mind, but his hand flashed before Robert could complete the attack. Noah found himself holding the expert’s wrist. His companions had even surrounded him on different spots.

A purple substance had come out of Robert’s fingers. The expert had tried to attack Noah right after the transformation, but he wore a mocking smile on his face. It seemed that he had no real intention to hurt Noah.

"Testing my power so quickly?" Noah asked while his grip tightened.

His companions imitated him. Snore enveloped the area with its massive body and placed one of its huge fangs on Robert’s head, Duanlong laid its large mouth on his waist, and Night sat on his shoulder.

The parasite’s roots had also begun to stretch toward Robert. They seemed ready to shoot forward and pierce the expert’s eyes. Only the Demonic Sword had remained still since it believed that Noah had the situation under control.

"I’m sorry, leader," Robert explained. "I couldn’t help myself. I haven’t experienced such freedom in millennia."

Robert tried to retract his hand, and Noah let him go. The expert then began to kneel, but Noah promptly kicked him on the c.h.e.s.t and forced him to stand up.

"Nobody kneels in my organization," Noah snorted.

"I deserve that," Robert laughed while spitting a mouthful of blood.

A tinge of fear had appeared in his mind. Noah had held himself back during the kick. Robert would have died otherwise.

Robert had just come back to life, and his existence had completely changed. He lacked proper control over his new energy, so it couldn’t stop Noah’s attack.

"Can you even fight?" Noah mocked Robert when he saw the scene.

"Of course," Robert announced while wiping his mouth. "I only need to get used to my new form."

"Use Rebecca as a training dummy," Noah ordered. "I’ll take care of Castor."

"Are you sure?" Robert asked in a surprised tone. "You have already fought for a long time. Let me handle the strongest opponent."

"I want his energy," Noah explained without bothering to turn, and Robert remained speechless.

A faint smile appeared on Robert’s face. He had forgotten about the struggle for power, but Noah was forcing him to recall how the cultivation journey worked. Existences had to seize every chance to obtain energy, and Noah embodied that feeling.

Wilfred and Divine Demon’s situation was far from ideal, but they were monsters. Castor could completely overpower them, but he always failed to inflict severe injuries.

Divine Demon had transformed a large chunk of the world into an azure mass that seemed able to resist Castor’s strange techniques. His challenge during the battle involved that aspect of the expert’s abilities and made him take a defensive role.

Wilfred used Divine Demon’s energy as a barrier while he launched a relentless offensive. His arms never stopped moving, and a storm of punches exploded in the air between Castor and him.

His attacks rarely managed to hit the expert. Castor’s strange techniques spread destruction in the very fabric of Wilfred’s offensive and stopped only when they reached the azure barrier. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Both sides appeared equally matched, but a second inspection would reveal that Divine Demon’s energy was slowly losing ground. Moreover, blocking Castor’s offensive made him deplete a lot of power. He would reach his limit soon, even with the world helping him.

Wilfred’s endurance was better off, but he found himself unable to reach Castor. His punches couldn’t pierce through the expert’s defenses. His battle prowess had yet to touch the solid stage cultivator.

Noah suddenly materialized above Castor. His Demonic Sword and the cursed sword fell downward to create a piercing singularity aimed at the expert’s head.

Castor didn’t let that event catch him by surprise. His aura quickly expanded and tried to engulf Noah in a destructive wave of power that wanted to push him backward.

The attack initially succeeded in pushing Noah’s back, but the parasite promptly helped in the matter. Black roots and dark matter spread above the swords and covered their singularity with a corrosive aura.

Castor couldn’t do anything at that point. Noah was using the cursed sword and the entirety of his arsenal. His weaker law crumbled against Noah’s attack and forced him to deploy an evasive maneuver.

The singularity was too fast and big. Castor saw a large chunk of his c.h.e.s.t disappearing during his escape, but he didn’t let that scene stop him.

Noah quickly disappeared to chase Castor. Dark matter covered his figure and suppressed the injuries caused by the cursed sword as his eyes followed the expert.

Noah didn’t want to give Castor the chance to recover. His offensive had to be relentless.

Castor stopped in a distant spot among the sky. He couldn’t try to reach the allied army due to the battle among the rank 9 existences, but he still needed some time to recover.

Noah’s corrosive energy was expanding through his flesh and altering his existence. Even the parasite’s aura carried his ambition and made his attack deadly for laws belonging to Heaven and Earth.

Castor summoned Heaven and Earth’s light, but a black shadow appeared above him before the sky could shine over his figure.

The expert promptly performed one of his techniques. His hand slowly rose toward Noah and sent energy that seeped inside the matter and forced it to fall apart.

The strange energy crushed a few roots and opened a crack in the fiendish armor, but Noah didn’t let that offensive stop him. His blades pointed forward, and power began to acc.u.mulate on their structure.

Danger filled Castor’s instincts and forced him to deploy another evasive maneuver. Yet, he suddenly lost control of part of his power. A dense mass of dark matter even gathered around his figure and stopped any attempt to leave the area.

Snore and Duanlong forced Castor to waste an additional second to free himself of their restraint. Noah didn’t need anything else. A singularity shot out of his blades and landed on the expert’s head.

Castor’s innate defenses tried to resist the attack. Everything inside him tried to preserve his mind and sacrifice disposable organs to keep the expert alive. However, a series of shockwaves exploded on his c.h.e.s.t, and azure energy began to seep inside his injuries.

Divine Demon and Wilfred didn’t let Noah handle the battle by himself. They had followed him and had attacked as soon as they found an opening in Castor’s defenses.

Divine Demon’s azure energy could counter Castor’s law, so it weakened his defenses when it seeped inside his body. Wilfred’s offensive carried the physical power of one of the strongest hybrids, so Castor’s c.h.e.s.t exploded into a gory spectacle.

Noah’s singularity finished piercing the expert after his companions’ abilities destabilized his insides. Castor died right under the white sky, but Snore promptly expanded to block his connection with the light.

The dark world expanded and enveloped Snore. The snake could release Castor and leave everything else to Noah and Night. The duo would take care of killing the expert for real.
