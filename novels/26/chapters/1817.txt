Chapter 1818 - 1818. Centipede

The experts immediately understood that they were in front of a rank 9 threat. The nature of their opponent was unclear since the storms blocked most of their vision and mental waves, but they prepared for the fight nonetheless. They wouldn’t run away at the first sign of danger.

King Elbas raised his arm, and a golden orb came out of his palm. A blinding radiance shot out of the item and seeped inside the storms in the area. The chaotic laws began to slow down under that influence, which enlarged the visible zone.

Alexander placed a hand on his forehead, and a purple eye opened in that spot when he removed his palm. The light that came out of the new organ shone on the calmer storms and tried to reach the hidden areas behind them, but it couldn’t go too far.

Fear filled Steven’s mind, but a resolute expression soon appeared on his face, and an invisible aura spread out of his body. The energy generated by his determination created an oval shield that surrounded the eight experts and tried to push the chaotic laws back.

Robert waved his hands multiple times, and tiny purple orbs shot out of his fingers whenever he completed his movements. Those spheres entered the storms and expanded to create massive toxic areas among the blind zones.

Wilfred’s abilities didn’t suit that unclear situation, so he moved to the center of the group and prepared to attack at the first sign of danger. His muscles bulged as veins popped on his large arms, neck, and forehead. He appeared ready to explode, but he contained his power since the area remained silent.

Divine Demon snorted. He didn’t have anyone to challenge, and the unknown opponent made his annoyance intensify. The energy inside the storms separated and fused with his figure before a series of azure flares shot forward and illuminated large covered areas.

Sword Saint remained calmer than the others. A silver blade materialized in his grasp, and slashes flew out of it in random directions while he remained still. He was only studying the environment, but each of those attacks carried almost peak rank 8 power.

Noah made the unstable substance flow inside his black veins, and the Demonic Sword materialized in his palm. A layer of dark matter covered his skin, and black roots entangled themselves around his body while he took a step back to get away from his companions. The parasite’s corrosive aura could weaken their abilities, and Noah wanted to avoid that.

The noise generated by the howling winds made of chaotic laws filled the area and covered the other sounds. Even the echoes of the experts’ abilities became nothing more than muffled commotions among that mess.

The environment of the stormy lands was perfect for ambushes as long as the attackers could pinpoint the eventual targets’ location. The group’s opponent seemed to fit in that category after witnessing how precise the spike aimed at Steven had been.

’What is it waiting for?" Noah wondered, but a massive shape suddenly became visible among the storms behind him.

Noah didn’t have the time to turn. The immense figure pierced the wave of storms and fell toward the group. Everyone could see a black exoskeleton moving at an unfathomable speed toward them and threatening to flatten all of them with a single attack.

The exoskeleton embodied pure doom. It was so fast that the experts struggled to study its features. The structure seemed to belong to a massive insect-like magical beast, and countless spikes filled its sides, but everything was vague due to its speed and size.

Wilfred released the energy acc.u.mulated in his muscles. His arms appeared as heavy as mountains as they bent and made each other’s knuckles clash.

A detonation happened right under the exoskeleton falling on the group. Part of the gales ended up shattering when the shockwaves released by Wilfred’s attack spread through the area. His technique even managed to slow down the enemy offensive, but that effect lasted for less than an instant.

An instant was enough to perform many actions when it came to rank 8 experts. The group only featured existences who could express peak rank 8 prowess, so Wilfred’s attack created a chance to dodge.

Everyone except Noah retreated, but the experts noticed that he had remained in his position too late. He had already lost his chance to escape the incoming attack by then, and they were too far away to interrupt their escape. They couldn’t reach him in time, so they continued to fly away.

’This thing lives at the edges of the stormy regions,’ Noah thought as the Demonic Sword disappeared and a dark aura surrounded his figure. ’I can’t explore this place yet if I can’t handle such a weak creature.’

Multiple faces appeared on Noah’s skin, but his body didn’t go through any sudden change. His ambition didn’t come out either. He retained his normal cultivation level as his arms rose and prepared themselves to face the attack.

The massive exoskeleton fell on Noah’s body and sent an immense force inside him. Noah wanted to hold his position, but he inevitably fell after struggling for a few seconds. He flew across the storms as cracking noises spread from his insides, but his back eventually landed on a sandy area and made him stop.

Storms continued to rage around him, but they were thinner in that spot. Noah could stare at distant areas with his b.a.r.e eyes, and the creature’s true nature became evident in his mind when he inspected that scene.

The red sand had countless black spikes stabbed on its surface, but Noah only paid attention to the immense creature in the distance. The opponent was a massive centipede that could cover the entire region with its body.

Noah stood up and checked his condition. His arms, shoulders, and back hurt. Multiple bones had broken across his torso, and entire patches of skin had disappeared after the impact. His defensive techniques had also vanished, but the outcome of the clash was undisputable. He had endured the attack of a rank 9 magical beast without relying on his ambition.

A wave of bloodl.u.s.t came out of his figure as Noah drew the cursed sword out of his c.h.e.s.t. Dark matter that replicated the structure of his flames covered the weapon and expanded in the area.

Intense waves of energy flowed inside his body as the dark matter burnt the sand and part of the storms. That fuel didn’t manage to heal his bones, but the black hole used it to stabilize his condition and make him able to express his full power.

’Enough playing around,’ Noah thought as his ambition surged.

No additional technique appeared on his body. Noah didn’t need anything else when he used his ambition. Even the assets currently deployed in his offensive were nothing more than a necessary tool.

After all, the cursed sword needed to kill stronger enemies to advance, and Noah required the centipede’s energy to fix his injuries and gain more power.

One of the spikes on the centipede’s side stretched and transformed into a perfect copy of its body. Noah could see the creature staring at him. Its black eyes expressed only hunger, and its pincers released noises that the storms couldn’t stop when they opened and closed.
