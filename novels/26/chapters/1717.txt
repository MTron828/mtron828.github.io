Chapter 1718 - 1718. Struggle

The invisible mass of energy opened as the two experts slashed its surface open. Noah quickly rotated it toward the rank 9 crackling figure, and Sword Saint didn’t hesitate to enlarge the crack to direct its power toward their target.

The invisible sphere suddenly shrunk. The energy contained in its insides couldn’t remain in place when Noah and Sword Saint compromised its structure.

The attack discharged its full power toward the crackling figure. The wave of energy gained the laws of the experts involved in the unorthodox technique. It grew hungrier and sharper as it flew through the white environment.

The whiteness couldn’t even exist in the same place as that sharp energy. The blow featured Noah’s chaotic laws and destroyed the light before it could even try to weaken the attack.

Meanwhile, the massive wave of energy clashed with the crackling figure and forced it to endure the blow. No amount of power could stop that attack. It featured the apex of two existences that walked the path of the sword.

Noah and the others saw that a small crack had appeared on the giant. That sight quickly brought life back to the rest of the army. They had a chance to win as long as they survived.

"Again!" Sword Saint shouted. "Go all-out!"

’Stop empowering the companions!’ Noah ordered in his mind, and his ambition followed. ’Remove the mind too. Focus everything on this blow!’

Noah’s power changed while his aura spread in the environment again and began to amass energy. The rotating star quickly gathered in front of the duo, and its color changed as its density increased.

The energy went from multicolored to dark. It then turned invisible until it became a mass of torn space that radiated a black light. The environment seemed to shatter when the occasional flares of the structure touched the area. The rotating sphere only had to exist to destroy the world around it.

Noah didn’t stop. It was clear that the previous attack didn’t manage to reach the intended power. The duo wouldn’t be able to destroy the rank 9 crackling figure if they limited themselves to inflict slight cracks.

Space twisted and shattered. A spiderweb of cracks connected to the void opened around the rotating sphere. It seemed that the world wanted to kick out Noah’s technique, but he used his understanding of the plane’s fabric to suppress the fissures.

Currents of energy inevitably flowed toward the various small cracks. They tried to push Sword Saint and Noah toward their black insides, but the experts didn’t even bother to look at them.

Their entire attention was on the rotating sphere. The duo even ignored the rank 9 giant in the process. That mighty attack couldn’t accept any distraction.

Battle cries resounded from the army. The wave of desperation that had filled the experts before had vanished, replaced by an intense d.e.s.i.r.e to live.

The cultivators could see that their leaders were monsters capable of affecting rank 9 beings. They were the underlings of existences that defied common reasons, so they couldn’t put up a shameful act.

The crackling figures and light drew near even if Robert was trying to handle every side of the battlefield. The expert was filling large chunks of the whiteness with toxic rain, but his efforts weren’t enough to stop the enemy offensive. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Most of the cultivators had instinctively activated secret arts to boost their power temporarily. Moreover, their auras had begun to feature a feeling that he knew far too well. The experts had started to radiate Noah’s ambition!

Robert exploded into a crazy laugh before waving his hands and launching even more attacks. He didn’t care that the process was hurting his centers of power. Pieces of his body even shattered due to the massive output of energy discharged by his figure.

The rank 9 crackling figure raised its arm again. It wanted to launch another series of shockwaves toward the two experts causing a mess in the area right in front of it. However, a dark-blue comet suddenly clashed with its hand.

Divine Demon had caught up with Sword Saint and Noah while the two prepared the attack. The expert instinctively pursued the approach that could grant him more chances to survive, so he used all the acc.u.mulated power to stop the incoming attack.

Divine Demon didn’t have the power to block a rank 9 creature. It didn’t matter that his law was generating abilities meant to counter Heaven and Earth. He remained a liquid stage cultivator trying to stop a being at the peak of the cultivation journey.

Yet, Wilfred and King Elbas appeared next to Divine Demon as the arm started to descend. Their lives were on the line, and blocking the imminent attack could make the difference between life and death.

King Elbas threw two orbs toward the experts, and a golden light quickly covered their figures. Wilfred gave voice to a sharp cry before slamming toward the arm and using his entire physical might to help Divine Demon.

King Elbas didn’t stop there. An army of golden items spread behind his figure. He deployed all the weapons meant to counter Heaven and Earth contained in his space-rings. Some of them were mere rank 7 tools, but he couldn’t hold anything back.

Sword Saint and Noah were oblivious to those events. Twisted space filled his vision as their auras fused. Their movements began to synchronize, and they instinctively understood that Noah wouldn’t be able to rotate that immense mass of energy.

Their arms moved at the same time. Both experts placed their swords on their forehead and closed their eyes. They didn’t have to fill the entire area with their sharpness. They only had to open a crack on the other side of the rotating sphere.

Their existence seemed to go silent as both experts sent everything toward their consciousness. Noah’s mental sphere almost shattered due to the strenuous task, but the black hole immediately took care of reinforcing the mental walls.

A wave of sharpness suddenly exploded in the area. The attack only occupied a small spot, but everyone could sense the immense energy that it carried.

The sphere of twisted space stopped rotating as a crack spread on its surface. The energy in its insides didn’t immediately flow out. Instead, the immense density of the technique almost managed to keep it in its position.

Yet, the sphere’s structure inevitably began to fall apart. Cracks spread around the main fissure and enlarged its area. The density of the technique continued to keep the energy in that spot, but everything grew unstable as the seconds passed.

The first small lump of energy that managed to escape from the sphere started a chain reaction that lasted for less than an instant. The world itself began to tremble as the technique released the entirety of its power and made the area grow dark.

Noah couldn’t think nor see. His senses had gone dark. Even his instincts didn’t give voice to any cry.

Then, a massive pressure fell on his figure and pushed him forward. Noah’s mind began to work again as the fear of ending up in the void filled his thoughts. Yet, his body felt too weak to oppose the process.

Author’s notes: I reviewed the previous chapter and made some small changes to improve the flow. The next chapter will arrive in an hour or two. Anyway, my arm is better, but I don’t know about Chaos’ Heir just yet.
