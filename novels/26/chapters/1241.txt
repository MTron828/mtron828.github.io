Chapter 1244 1244. Damage

The dark winds ripped off the armor made of dark matter, but they lost their power after completing that feat. A large opening appeared on the black tornado, but the sparks that ran through it soon filled that spot.

Noah only had the Demonic Form at that point. The sparks generated lightning bolts that destroyed his fiendish armor and landed on his skin. However, the damage that they inflicted wasn’t even worthy of consideration for someone like Noah.

His skin cracked, and many cuts appeared on his body. Yet, his resilience went beyond both magical beasts and hybrids. Those injuries didn’t even manage to slow him down.

Noah crossed that barrage of spells and entered inside the maimed tornado. Calm filled the area, but two figures soon appeared in his vision.

God’s Left Hand and Great Elder Diana were both injured. The last array of attacks had crushed their defenses and threatened to kill them on the spot.

The complete activation of their inscribed scrolls had saved them from certain death. The tornado and the countless sparks that filled its surface were the best spells that those items could generate.

God’s Left Hand had already suffered some light injuries during the previous exchanges, but the last clash left her maimed. Her left arm had disappeared, and part of her torso had become a bloody mess.

The injuries even spread to her legs. Her entire left side was about to fall apart, and only her mental energy kept it together.

Great Elder Diana was a bit better off, but she had also suffered her share of damage. Her right hand had lost a few fingers, and patches of broken skin filled her legs.

A few cuts had appeared on her torso and face too. Yet, those were still light injuries for an expert on that level.

The Matriarchs had to endure attacks that were on the same level as those launched by them. The difference in the injuries came from the innate defenses of their bodies.

The toughness of Noah’s skin could match the power of a couple of defensive spells, while the Matriarchs’ bodies were far below the magical beasts’ level. The duo couldn’t surpass him when it came to resilience, even if they were two against one.

Noah sprinted toward the Matriarchs, but they both snapped their fingers when they saw him. Their individualities also surged while they prepared new attacks. The dark world’s suppression couldn’t reach the empty area at the center of the tornado.

The tornado and the sparks caved in. They began to fill the area with pieces of attacks that flew for a while before converging toward Noah.

Meanwhile, Great Elder Diana and God’s Left Hand unleashed techniques that carried their intense individualities.

God’s Left Hand was a calamity. Her winds existed to destroy and fly unbound through both land and sky.

Countless gales came out of her figure and began to twist around her as if they were giant snake-like creatures. They even rotated to create a series of attacks that converged toward Noah.

Great Elder Diana had perfect control over her wild element. Sparks accumulated around her and gave birth to countless minute arrows, with each of them carrying the power of her lightning bolts.

Those spells joined the collapse of the previous ones in their flight toward Noah. He sensed threats from every direction, but he had every intention to continue moving forward.

Dark matter came out of his chest as he deployed the dark world again. The spells that carried the Matriarchs’ individualities lost power as the higher energy banished those laws from Noah’s domain.

Noah could charge through them without worrying about his safety once the dark world suppressed those spells. He waved his hand to launch slashes that tore through the violent gales, and his body destroyed the arrows when they crashed on him.

The arrows only managed to leave small dots on his skin. Those weren’t even worthy of being injuries for his standards, but he could understand how dangerous it would have been to face those attacks without the dark world.

Both God’s Left Hand and Great Elder Diana could injure him if he ignored their attacks. The Matriarchs were worthy of his respect even if they relied on their numerical advantage to deal with his techniques.

Noah quickly made his way through the spells and arrived in front of the Matriarchs. His sword cut through the fabric of the sky as it slashed toward them.

Both Matriarchs activated a talisman to deal with that attack. Black winds raged out of God’s Left Hand’s palm, and a giant bird-like creature made of lightning bolts came out of Great Elder Diana’s figure.

Part of those spells fell into the crack created by Noah’s slash, but the rest of them swept Noah and pushed him away. However, he managed to wave his hand and Demonic Sword again before returning inside the area with crumbling sparks and winds.

Noah’s hand released five casual slashes that landed on God’s Left Hand. She didn’t have any protection in that situation, so the attack chopped her remaining arm and created five long marks on her torso.

Those injuries were even quite deep. God’s Left Hand’s life might have been at risk if it wasn’t for the array of spells flinging Noah away.

The Demonic Sword released a thick black line that bent the air around it. Great Elder Diana was also defenseless, and the attack severed her lower body, transforming her into nothing more than a floating torso.

Noah suffered injuries too. The winds ravaged his body and rotated as they tried to pierce his skin.

The Matriarchs had given up on inflicting new injuries and focused on enlarging those suffered during the previous exchanges. Noah’s chest was their favorite target since it was full of small holes due to Great Elder Diana’s arrows.

The black winds crashed on Noah, and the bird-like creature engulfed him before trapping him inside its body. Lightning bolts ran through its figure and landed on him while trying to stop his momentum and escape from that situation.

The spells had slowly managed to create large wounds on his body, but dark matter promptly came out of them to protect him and prevent further damage. It had also started to heal those injuries.

The winds and lightning bolts appeared indestructible even when he relied on his physical strength, but he soon placed the Demonic Sword on his forehead and focused on his individuality.

His sharpness surged. Countless cuts appeared on the bird’s body and made it crumble into a rain of raging sparks. The same went for the gales that still tried to hit him. They became nothing more than shattered air after his slashes finished destroying them.

Noah’s sharpness didn’t affect only the spells around him. His consciousness reached even the Matriarchs who saw a series of cuts appearing on their maimed bodies out of nowhere.

God’s Left Hand coughed blood as her defensive spells tried to stop that technique. She couldn’t stop Noah’s cuts at all, and they continued to ravage her body no matter how injured she was.

Great Elder Diana had already lost a lot, and those cuts didn’t help her. However, her individuality could deal with the attack more easily. She would directly burn the injuries’ edges as soon as they appeared.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com
