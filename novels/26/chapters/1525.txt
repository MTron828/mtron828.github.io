Chapter 1526 1526. Hear

The dragon could destroy the draconic armor and damage Noah’s body with simple attacks. Instead, Noah had to be careful of his every move to inflict even the slightest injury.

Now that the pulling force had intensified, the whole area around the dragon’s head affected Noah’s techniques. Even his draconic form began to melt whenever he approached those spots.

’I wish I had the time to cut it into pieces,’ Noah cursed in his mind before teleporting on the dragon’s side.

His blades shot forward, and a deep cut opened through the dragon’s scales. The creature turned toward him, and he failed to activate the teleport again.

The dragon slammed its leg on Noah’s draconic chest. The immense physical strength carried by the blow flung him away and forced him to activate his flames again.

’I can’t keep fighting like this,’ Noah thought once he straightened his position.

The dragon often moved, so Noah always had the chance to burn something. The creature was suffering more injuries than him, but that was only a temporary advantage.

Noah had to use his ambition to fight the dragon. His law had to flow inside his techniques every time he attacked or sprinted, and it also had to remain active to keep his centers of power at the peak of the seventh rank.

Noah couldn’t keep that empowerment for too long. He depleted massive amounts of darkness every time he pushed his techniques past the limits of the seventh rank.

’I will run out of darkness before this creature starts to feel tired,’ Noah concluded in his mind.

The rank 8 Foolery had always come in his aid during battles that featured annoying opponents. Noah often had to let the pig finish his fights because his ambition ran out at some point.

However, the Foolery was busy fighting the other rank 8 dragon. Noah had to handle that battle on his own, but his situation appeared quite grim.

’Snore, Night. It’s time to test that technique,’ Noah said through his mental connection.

’Can you handle it?’ Night asked.

’We’ll find out soon enough,’ Noah replied before closing his eyes to focus on his law.

Snore and Night appeared by his side and let his aura flow through them. Their fabric condensed under that power, and their level increased due to the marvelous effects of his law.

Noah had learnt how to make his ambition focus on his techniques, but he could apply that ability to all his assets. His battle prowess could reach the eighth rank, and he could do the same when it came to his companions.

The draconic form dispersed, and part of its energy returned inside his dantian. Noah required darkness to make use of that insane amount of ambition, so he had to reduce the number of techniques deployed at the same time to endure those expenses.

’The drawbacks will be harsh,’ Noah thought. ’We must kill it.’

Snore hissed at the sky as its fabric condensed. Night also roared before disappearing inside the structure of the world.

The dragon was charging toward Noah with its giant mouth spread open. The sky darkened as whiteness flowed inside its mouth. It wouldn’t take much before its pulling force reached Noah.

Snore unfolded its wings and launched its sharp feathers. Some of them exploded before reaching the dragon since the pulling force made them unstable. Yet, most of them managed to explode on its body.

Most of those feathers exploded inside the dragon’s mouth. The violent energy released during the detonation tried to destroy that organ, but it ended up condensing and flowing through the creature’s throat.

The feathers that managed to explode on the dragon’s skin shattered its scales and destroyed large patches of its skin. The might released in their detonation even forced the creature to interrupt its charge.

One of its legs suddenly separated from its body. Night briefly reappeared high in the sky before disappearing again when it dived toward the dragon.

Noah shot forward, and Snore followed him. The duo flew around the dragon to avoid its pulling force and shot toward the unprotected parts of its body.

The dragon tried to turn its head toward Noah, but another leg separated from its body. The creature looked at a seemingly empty spot in the sky at that point, and Night quickly materialized due to the effects of the pulling force.

The Pterodactyl flew outside the range of that ability and merged with the world again. Snore used that moment of distraction to stab its teeth on the dragon’s torso and cover its body with violent dark matter. Noah also reached his opponent and slashed at its back.

Snore’s teeth dug deeper into the dragon’s scales as its violent energy destroyed its skin and seeped inside its injuries. The creature eventually turned toward the Blood Companion, and trails of dark matter flowed out of the snake’s body to converge in its opponent’s mouth.

Night severed another leg at that point, and Noah promptly launched a slash toward one of the bleeding injuries. Snore then bit on those wounds and ripped a large chunk of the dragon’s skin apart.

The dragon didn’t know where to look. Attacks would land on its body whenever it turned. Its pulling force wasn’t helping in that situation. Noah and the others could coordinate perfectly and exploit the blind spots in its defense.

The pulling force was stronger in front of the creature’s mouth and weaker behind its back. That allowed Noah and the others to focus on any other part of its body and cover it in injuries.

Yet, that still wasn’t enough to kill the dragon. Noah needed to inflict deadly injuries to defeat that creature. He couldn’t continue destroying its skin in the hope that it would succumb to its wounds.

’The head is off limits,’ Noah said through the mental connection. ’Let’s aim for its heart!’

Noah, Night, and Snore alternated their offensive to force the dragon into a deadlock. The snake endured most of the pulling force and kept the creature still while Noah and the Pterodactyl focused on creating a bloody path toward its heart.

’Can you reach it?’ Noah asked through the mental connection after creating a large hole through the dragon’s rib cage. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

’I can’t,’ Night replied. ’There are too many tissues along the way.’

’Snore!’ Noah shouted, and the snake promptly stabbed its teeth on that injury.

Snore’s teeth naturally released violent dark matter. The Blood Companion could also spit clouds made of that destructive energy.

Once Snore bit on the injury, a wave of violent dark matter spread inside the dragon and ravaged its organs. The creature roared in pain and decided to close its mouth on a piece of the snake’s body. Its pulling force even intensified after that gesture.

Snore immediately shrunk. The dark matter inside its fabric flowed out of its body and entered the dragon’s mouth. Noah didn’t have enough energy to compensate for that process.

Noah teleported above the dragon. His blades pointed at its back and stabbed deep into its body after a reckless dive. The Demonic Sword even spread dark matter to transform into its draconic form and enlarge the injury to create a passage for Night.

The Pterodactyl remained hidden until Noah managed to create a tunnel through the dragon’s chest. Night then shot inside the creature and severed every vital organ that it found.

Once Night reached its heart, it cut away every vessel linked to that organ before piercing it. The dragon could only let go of Snore when it felt that its life was about to abandon its body.

Noah couldn’t let the dragon turn for fear that its influence could affect Night. He jumped in front of the creature and performed a violent descending slash while dark matter covered his blades.

The attack didn’t manage to pierce the creature’s scales, but it was powerful enough to make its head slam on the ground. During that window, Night finished destroying the heart.
