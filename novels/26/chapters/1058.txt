Chapter 1061 1061. Jelly

Noah felt a sticky membrane enveloping his figure even before the light of the teleportation matrix faded. A female voice reached his ears while his eyes became used to the new scenery. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

"We knew someone would have used this method to invade us!" The cultivator exclaimed. "State your name and your organiz-."

The cultivator stopped speaking when the light dispersed, and Noah’s figure became visible. Everyone in the world knew his face, so she couldn’t help but feel fear when she recognized him.

Noah found himself covered in a green substance that hindered his movements and kept him locked on the ground. The material resembled an elastic and opaque jelly capable of blocking even his mental waves.

The Elbas family didn’t forget about the raids in the Utra nation. Its many inscription masters didn’t understand the nature of the separate dimension, but they developed measures that could block any ability of that kind.

The woman analyzed the jelly around Noah with a worried expression. The material could stop quasi-rank 6 attacks, but it couldn’t hold a powerhouse for long.

According to his centers of power, Noah wouldn’t be considered a complete powerhouse, but the battle prowess shown in the other world had demonstrated that he was more than worthy of that title.

The woman began to retreat, knowing that Noah would break free anytime soon. However, she had underestimated how deep inside the sixth rank Noah’s power was, and her initial hesitation turned out to be a fatal mistake.

Noah had spent so long immersed in the ancient aura that some of his mind’s features had changed already. His mental waves had become sharper, and his existence had returned to express the main characteristic that had accompanied his individuality since the beginning.

He was a blade. His individuality had begun to express other features as he explored his destruction and creation, but his sharpness had always been the first will fueled by his ambition.

Noah could easily break out of the jelly’s constraints, but he would lose half an instant to do so, and the woman wearing a golden robe would escape due to that delay.

Yet, his middle finger was free to move since the edges of his hand kept that spot without jelly. Noah only needed to flicker it for a black line to come out of his palm and pierce the green substance.

If his existence was a blade, then every cell of his body could become a sword. Noah had always used weapons to enhance his power output, but the Cut had shown him that he could apply his sharpness to his entire being.

The woman of the Elbas family was only a cultivator at the peak of the fourth rank. The jelly weakened Noah’s casual slash, but his enemy’s body shattered when the black line touched her back.

Noah stabbed his fingers in the opening and widened his arms. The jelly tried to stop him, but the sheer power contained in his limbs forced stretched it until it snapped.

His consciousness expanded as he tore apart the green substance lingering on his body. His mission was to attract as much attention as possible and see if his target was inside the Royal Academy.

The Royals wouldn’t forget about June with him there. They would initially try to take care of both intruders, but Noah had already decided to go all-out.

His mental waves could cover almost all the Academy, but they couldn’t seep through many buildings. There were defensive inscriptions everywhere, and many structures had multiple layers of them.

The layout of the Royal Academy became clear in Noah’s mind. To his surprise, the Elbas family had arranged that place in the same way as the old Academy.

The Royal Academy resembled a small city that had a shining river dividing it into two parts. One side had various habitations, while the other had large research buildings.

Of course, the value of those structures was on a superior league compared to the old Academy. That wasn’t a place where human cultivators could walk, and even beings in the fourth rank would find it hard to endure the pressure accumulated in the area.

Noah could sense the presence of training zones in the peripheral areas of the Academy, but his interest was in the assets that populated the buildings and streets. His focus eventually went on one of them. His mental waves had successfully located Cecil Elbas.

’You were here in the end,’ Noah thought as a smile appeared on his face, and black smoke came out of his skin. He couldn’t help but feel happy at the idea that he was about to unleash his destruction in that place.

That feeling didn’t come only from his enmity with the Elbas family. He was simply happy that he was about to express his individuality.

Countless shining lines lit up around him as soon as he took a step outside of the jelly. Many defenses activated, and runes even appeared on the sky since his corrosive smoke was tainting the air.

Noah felt the power of the sixth rank in some of the lines around him, but his mind sensed no danger. It was as if it knew that he could cross them easily.

The spiked armor formed, and Snore appeared next to him. The Demonic Sword came out of his robe and flew inside his clawed hand, ready to fight alongside him.

Noah didn’t worry about his living weapon’s integrity anymore. The Cut had shown him movements that could alleviate the pressure on the Demonic Sword even if he used most of his physical strength.

The ground morphed, and fifty armored knights came out of it. A silver metallic layer covered their bodies, and each of them radiated the power of the peak of the fifth rank.

Purple lines appeared in the sky, and a heavy pressure began to focus on Noah’s mind. A series of mirrors came out of the buildings nearby, and "Breath" of various elements gathered on their surface.

Three massive humanoid puppets surged from the river in the distance and began to walk in Noah’s direction. They exuded power in the sixth rank, and their bodies appeared to lack a core, which meant that there was only water in their structure.

More and more defenses activated in the distance. It was as if the entirety of the Royal Academy had transformed into an army of inscribed items that had to take him down as their only goal.

Noah didn’t expect any less from the most advanced organization in the inscription field. Actually, he found those defenses too weak, which told him that there were more of them in deeper parts of the Academy.

A series of cultivators wearing golden armors rose from some buildings in the distance. All of them wielded heavy cannons that had shining lines covering the entirety of its surface.

Everything pointed toward Noah, but he didn’t show any fear.

’I guess I can begin,’ Noah thought as the fiendish smirk on his helmet enlarged. A human-shaped crack appeared in his position, and a starry sky covered the entire area.
