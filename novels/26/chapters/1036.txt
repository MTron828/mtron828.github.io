Chapter 1037 1037. Drug

"You’ll die if you go against them," Noah conveyed through his consciousness, but June didn’t turn. She continued to walk forward with her head hidden under her giant hat.

Most of June’s superior battle prowess came from her higher energy. She was like Snore, capable of surpassing the level of her centers of power because her fuel was far superior to the "Breath". The only problem was that June’s individuality pushed that advantage further, making her Perfect Circuit unable to withstand her power anymore.

Noah couldn’t understand much from a simple glance, but he noticed how June’s body seemed on the verge of exploding. Her centers of power didn’t have the time to push the higher energy outside of her that more black sparks formed inside them.

"Why did you try to hide this from me?" Noah asked as he raised his voice. The cloud of black sparks dispersed due to the sound’s intensity, and the water retreated, creating an empty area right in the middle of the sea’s depths.

June stopped at that point, but she didn’t turn. Her perfect circuit began to leak higher energy again, but Noah’s consciousness expanded and dispersed the second cloud while it kept the water around them still.

The more June avoided answering his questions, the more Noah understood how severe her condition was.

"I can’t help you if you don’t tell me what the problem is," Noah said, but a power surge suddenly spread from June’s body and gave birth to another crackling could. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Noah saw how June turned to face him even if her hat kept her face hidden. She remained silent for a while before deciding to speak for the first time. "You can’t help me."

Noah remained silent as he waited for June to continue. She only hesitated a few more seconds before explaining. "If you fix this for me, I’ll feel defeated forever."

Small help wouldn’t affect her, and Noah lending a hand to create her higher energy wasn’t a vital matter. Yet, June’s life depended on her ability to fix her condition at that time, and she couldn’t let anyone but her taking credit for that.

If Noah saved her life, she would lose her desire to fight him. Her individuality only needed a crack to fall apart, and Noah understood that after her words.

"Do you think that dying is the solution?" Noah asked. He wasn’t ready to give up on June. There were ways in which he could help her without endangering the integrity of her individuality.

"This is the only way," June answered, spreading her arms to indicate the crackling cloud. "I need to force breakthroughs to contain this power."

Noah couldn’t help but sigh when he heard that. June had chosen to act as a true battle maniac, but her odds of succeeding were horrible. Cultivators couldn’t just force breakthroughs in the heroic ranks. The Royal pool wouldn’t be so miraculous otherwise.

"Is there nothing else you can do?" Noah asked as he began to walk toward her. The black sparks tried to destroy his robe, but his dark matter fended them off.

"I-. You can’t." June said while she tried to suppress her voice. Noah saw her holding back from speaking and shot forward, shattering the remaining cloud and pushing the waters backward again.

June didn’t move even when his hand went on her hat to lift it. Noah saw messy hair falling everywhere on his lover’s face as he removed that heavy inscribed item.

June’s furrowed brows and closed eyes revealed the pain that she had been enduring in her condition. She dropped her act and her mouth and joined the rest of her face in expressing her suffering.

Noah had never seen her in that condition. She seemed on the verge of collapsing, and all her efforts were on making sure that her Perfect Circuit held strong.

"Let it go," Noah said as he caressed her face. June shook her head, but her expression eased up when his hand touched her cheek.

The couple remained in that position for a while, immersed in the sensation that they had been unable to feel for centuries. Noah didn’t feel his arousal, but his mind calmed down when he touched her, and his dark heart spun faster.

His creation spiked when he came in contact with the woman at the foundation of his idea of life. Noah had expressed so much destruction lately that he had almost forgotten how intense that harmonious calm was.

June’s hands rose to hold his, and her expression relaxed as a wave of higher energy came out of her Perfect Circuit. The black sparks were violent and threatened to hurt her body with their momentum, but they slowed down when Noah focused his mind on them.

Noah’s consciousness forced the higher energy to condense and leave June’s body in an orderly way. That was all the power that she had accumulated during her recent battles, so he had to disperse it to stabilize her condition.

Minutes slowly passed until, eventually, June’s Perfect Circuit became devoid of any energy.

June’s heaved a sigh and staggered when she felt empty, but Noah’s hand was firm, and she could cling to it to keep her balance. Her eyes opened for the first time and reflected the reptilian pupils fixed on her orange irises.

Except for the scales, Noah’s appearance didn’t change much after the chrysalis. Still, June could notice the small details that the breakthrough had modified.

His icy-blue irises had slightly enlarged and irradiated the white of his eyes with that bright color. He had become taller, and his skin resembled hot metal that didn’t have any crease on its surface.

Waves of heats filled his body whenever the dark star in his chest completed a rotation. His muscles were more pronounced, but only slightly. They didn’t ruin the harmony that he expressed.

Instead, June didn’t change much. Her look appeared a bit more mature, but she was still the young battle maniac met after the entrance test of the Academy in Noah’s eyes.

She had lost weight, and her face revealed how tired she was, but those were only the effects of her condition.

The couple stared at each other for a while before they went for each other’s lips and exchanged a slow kiss. They eventually separated to embrace each other and lose themselves in the feeling that their hug triggered.

"What are your other options?" Noah asked once he felt that she had completely relaxed and didn’t risk activating her Perfect Circuit again.

"Dying in a massive battle against creatures in the sixth rank is a great option," June said, and Noah felt her mouth breaking into a smirk on his chest. "Are you sure you don’t want to consider it?"

"I’m sorry," Noah said, "My stomach has booked those hybrids. You need to find another way."

June laughed, but her expression turned serious, and she left her chest to stare at Noah’s eyes again. When she sensed the feelings that they contained, she couldn’t help but reveal everything to him. "The Royal Academy has developed this new drug..."
