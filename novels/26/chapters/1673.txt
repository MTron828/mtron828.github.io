Chapter 1676 - 1676. Gathering

The pack of sharks couldn’t do much after they lost their leader. Noah killed all of them and let his dark matter absorb their bodies. His power had allowed the Devils to end the battle in no time.

Still, the Devils and the environment as a whole had changed during the battle. The laws didn’t belong to Heaven and Earth anymore, but a similar transformation had happened to the other creatures.

The surviving Devils had grown dark. The mutations that they triggered didn’t reflect the chaotic other world’s will anymore. They tried to push the matter to evolve, which made them closer to Noah’s ambition.

Of course, Noah was still unaware of his surroundings. The state of his consciousness didn’t improve, but the other Devils had developed a connection to his existence.

Noah’s actions didn’t even follow his instincts. They were the mere result of the other world’s will that filled his mind, but his existence had begun to affect its power.

The ambition that had come out of his figure earlier belonged to his existence. Yet, it had begun to transform due to the chaotic laws around his body.

Something was changing inside him, but that procedure had just begun. It would take time to understand if it could lead to proper results or if Noah would become a real Devil.

The Devils seemed attracted to his existence. They had developed a strange connection with him after the recent transformation. They wanted to fuse with his figure, but something prevented them from pursuing that approach.

The other world’s will eventually took over their behavior and swept away their confusion. The group of Devils and Noah resumed their aimless journey through the Immortal Lands. The presence of Heaven and Earth’s laws was a call that they couldn’t oppose.

Noah’s journey across the Immortal Lands continued. His army of Devils transformed everything they met and made sure that Heaven and Earth’s influence stopped reaching those areas.

The Devils would normally transform the environment randomly, but Noah’s group triggered less harmful mutations. Terrain and water stopped rising in the sky, and the air didn’t try to become ground anymore.

Tribulations eventually arrived again, and the same went for the packs of sharks. The Devils attracted both problems due to their nature, and their behavior prevented them cover their tracks.

Every battle against the sharks forced Noah to express more of his power. He didn’t only rely on his clawed fingers during the last fights. He also deployed simple spells that mainly consisted of all-devouring dark clouds.

His ambition continued to grow during that process. The many battles forced Noah to express the result of the mutations that were affecting his existence. The greatest changes involved his law. He had become more influential, and his pride had also intensified.

The transformations that hit the environment became more specific. The terrain didn’t become simple metal anymore. It mutated into a tough alloy that seemed able to absorb "Breath".

The same went for the water and air. Part of them transformed into dense liquids and gasses that enhanced their innate features. Noah’s ambition wasn’t only forcing their nature to evolve. It made sure that their best properties reached a higher level.

The Devils also went through similar changes. They slowly lost their red shades and became completely dark creatures. The random changes generated by their mutations vanished too. They were slowly transforming into entities capable of replicating the effects of Noah’s law.

Noah would have appreciated that evolution, but he still had no control over his consciousness. Yet, his instincts had begun to affect his behavior, even if only slightly.

Another change that involved the Devils was their connection with Noah. They slowly stopped obeying the will’s orders and began to follow Noah in an instinctive manner.

The Devils began to behave as if they were part of Noah’s pack. The other world’s will didn’t contain those instincts. The creatures had taken them from Noah’s influence and had learnt how they should act to be proper underlings.

The most surprising aspect of that transformation was that normal Devils immediately became attracted by Noah. The army increased in size whenever they met more of those creatures, and only the packs of sharks managed to lower their number.

That also changed at some point. Devils usually had to take damage before deciding to focus on eventual opponents, but Noah’s influence had made their aggression skyrocket.

That feature mainly affected Noah. He didn’t wait for the sharks to attack him anymore when his army met those packs. Instead, he directly charged toward their strongest specimen and deployed his faint techniques to overwhelm it.

Every battle made Noah reveal his improvements. Every year spent with the chaotic laws around his figure forced his existence to transform, but clarity still struggled to return to his mind.

A large army had gathered in a distant area of the Immortal Lands. Most of those troops had settled around a floating lake, but they had enough defenses at hand to fend off every external threat.

Noah’s companions were there, but those belonging to the Legion and his organizations occupied the peripheral areas of the settlement. They didn’t seem to go along with the other forces gathered during those years, but that feature didn’t bother them.

Althea eventually came out of the floating lake and reached King Elbas’ group. Her arrival alerted the experts, but they maintained relaxed expressions.

"Defying Demon has yet to return," Althea announced. "I’ve worked with the natives to understand his current location, but it seems that even Heaven and Earth can’t divine it."

"That’s not surprising," King Elbas sighed.

"Not surprising at all," Wilfred added.

"Heaven and Earth can’t track down my heir!" Divine Demon shouted before exploding into a loud laugh.

"This is a serious matter," Althea complained. "The final battle is approaching. Heaven and Earth will do something to send all the Devils and mutated magical beasts in our direction. Our troops aren’t enough to handle the battle."

"Are you challenging me?" Divine Demon asked, but Wilfred promptly placed a hand on his shoulder to stop that trend.

"We did what the three leaders asked," King Elbas snorted. "We even found another solid stage cultivator during our exploration. What more do you want? I’m ready to leave this place if you confirm that we are doomed." Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

"No one is leaving this side of the Immortal Lands," Althea threatened, and her aura began to leak out of her figure.

The other forces around the floating lake suddenly began to pay attention to that conversation. They were all Heaven and Earth’s followers, so they would punish anyone who tried to leave before the final battle.

"You do realize that antagonizing us now will only hurt you?" King Elbas sighed. "Remember that we decided to return. It’s only normal for us to have prepared a way out."

"We can search for him if you want," Fergie shrugged his shoulders.

"Living here is indeed boring," The Foolery said. "They force me to leave to poop."

"They are brutes," Divine Demon commented while patting the Foolery on the back.

"I would also like to gain access to Heaven and Earth’s connection," Luke announced. "I don’t like that your team is the only group who have seen the natives’ methods."

"That I can’t," Althea revealed while hiding a tinge of hesitation. "The leaders have already inspected all of us. My team is the only group that Heaven and Earth can accept. You all are too far away from their system."

"Why did you come here then?" King Elbas said in an annoyed tone. "Don’t blame us if that reckless idiot does something crazy."

"I only wanted to make sure that he didn’t contact you," Althea revealed before leaving the area and returning inside the floating lake.

King Elbas and the others could only exchange stern gazes after her departure. Their situation wasn’t ideal, and Noah was late. They would have to act without him if the war happened before his return.
