Chapter 1133 1133. Waves of attacks

"I advise you to step back!" First Prince conveyed as he and his sister deployed their inscribed items. A golden halo surrounded them as armors, shields, and longswords appeared next to them.

"It’s too late for that," Second Prince said as he interrupted his meditation to stand up. His stern eyes analyzed Noah and the others before a broad smile appeared on his face.

The experts next to Noah deployed their methods to defend against the Demonic Form, but their instincts told them that they wouldn’t be enough to block it.

Still, they didn’t have time to focus on Noah’s spell. Their surprise had to wait. Now there was only their desperate march.

The group had decided to attack King Elbas. None of them wanted to give up on their potential, so they had to face the Royal if they wanted to continue on their path.

Some of them had considered the possibility of escaping. However, King Elbas was at his peak, and no one could stop him on the surface. Dealing with the problem now was their only chance to ensure a future for their cultivation journey.

The experts spread around the seven stars when Noah activated his iconic spell. They summoned their weapons and unleashed their aura without any care for their reserves of "Breath" once they took their position.

Great Elder Diana took out her black lenses and created crackling spheres behind them as she prepared her offensive.

Chasing Demon wielded his stick covered in magical beasts’ carvings, and his "Breath" flowed inside it as he became ready for battle.

Flying Demon and Dreaming Demon were together. They didn’t rely on any inscribed item, but hundreds of white flowers grew around them, and dense mental waves invaded their fabric.

Dreaming Demon’s individuality wasn’t suitable for the environment of the void, but she could empower her lover’s spells. They had to work together to express their prowess to their fullest.

Elder Regina summoned an army of puppets. Various magical beasts made of sturdy rocks surrounded her and pointed their fangs at the seven stars.

Elder Julia disappeared, but countless wind slashes formed in the area. Weapons of various types also appeared and filled every empty spot around the Royals. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Winds started to blow inside the void. Hurricanes formed as God’s Left Hand unleashed her individuality. She was a calamity sent by a god, and the area was about to experience her power.

Elder Paul and True Speed were together too. The Council’s expert uncovered his right arm to reveal a red mass that covered his limb’s upper part.

His living weapon had improved again, and he didn’t hesitate to activate its power by creating a series of fiery lions in front of him.

Yellow sparks ran on True Speed’s legs and tore apart the lower part of his robe. His furry legs became visible to everyone, but no one cared about them in that situation.

Noah stepped forward. The black smoke coming out of his figure surrounded him in a corrosive cloud that hid the features of his armor. The three Royals lost track of his presence, but they didn’t dare to move their eyes away from the cloud.

Their arrogance didn’t make them blind. The Royals could see that Noah’s Demon Form was far more dangerous than before, but they didn’t let their surprise distract them.

The area was about to fall into complete chaos, and they could only rely on their inscribed items to defend unless their Father interrupted his meditation.

No one attacked. Everyone waited for something to trigger the now inevitable battle.

The eyes of the experts slowly focused on the corrosive cloud that hid Noah. The black smoke expanded, and it would soon touch the area covered by the dense radiations. It seemed that both attackers and defenders had silently decided to wait for that moment to start the battle.

Tension built among the Royals. They began to take step backs together with the expansion of the cloud. The pressure that they felt became even more intense when they sensed how relaxed their opponents were.

The Royals didn’t believe it first, but the attackers had given up on life to make that assault. God’s Left Hand and other’s determination wasn’t as intense, but they knew that they could die quickly too.

When the corrosive smoke touched the aura dense with radiations, mayhem engulfed the entire battlefield.

The spheres behind Great Elder Diana’s lenses released lighting bolts that the black glass enhanced. They shot toward King Elbas and exploded into a crackling gray cloud.

Chasing Demon activated his stick, and an army of magical beasts made of a rocky substance formed before charging at the seven stars.

Flying Demon detonated his flowers, and Dreaming Demon empowered their properties. A layer of ice covered the entire battlefield, and a storm of ice-shards ravaged the area while spreading the Demon’s individuality further.

Elder Regina’s puppets shot toward King Elbas, and many of them detonated when they came in contact with the dense radiations of the raw laws.

The many wind-weapons around the array of stars flew forward and severed everything they could. A few of them managed to get past the radiations, but they reached the grey cloud nonetheless.

God’s Left Hand unleashed her storms. Her hurricanes crashed on the star in front of her and released violent gales that ravaged the area.

True Speed and Elder Paul launched their abilities too. The Elder made his lions charge at the Royal, and True Speed kicked the air to throw yellow lightning bolts that landed directly near King Elbas’ position.

A series of black sabers came out of the corrosive cloud. They exploded once they touched the Royals’ inscribed defenses, and they spread the dark smoke further.

The attackers had launched their offensive. Some of their attacks had targeted King Elbas, but many had focused on covering the entire battlefield.

Noah had aimed for the Royals since they stood on his path. He had used part of the revisited Shadow Copy spell to launch sabers carrying the corrosive smoke. Still, they were only casual attacks meant to test his opponents’ reactions.

The attacks made a mess out of the area. The void couldn’t fall apart, but part of the light inside the stars separated from the spheres and spread in the environment.

The powerhouses didn’t destroy the raw laws, but their spells had affected the structure of the stars and disturbed King Elbas’ meditation.

The Royals soon became visible again. A golden light pierced the corrosive smoke that had surrounded them and revealed their shining figures.

The golden shields around them had been enough to block Noah’s casual attack, but there was no happiness in their expression. First Prince, First Princess, and Second Prince didn’t even bother to check their condition before turning toward their Father.

A gray cloud had covered King Elbas’ figure, and many attacks had pierced it while he remained hidden inside it. His consciousness didn’t show any reaction at those attacks, so everyone knew that the offensive didn’t hurt him.

The gray smoke soon dispersed and revealed King Elbas surrounded by a thick array of golden runes. He had activated an inscribed item to fend off that offensive, but annoyance soon spread through his mental waves.

King Elbas broke his cross-legged position and stood up. His gaze swept the experts of the other forces and expressed his reluctance to take part in that struggle.

"Why do you even fight this?" King Elbas conveyed through his consciousness. He found that desperate effort completely pointless.

The attackers didn’t answer. Their reply was another series of attacks covering the entire area and filling the void with their destructive might.
