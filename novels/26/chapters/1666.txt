Chapter 1667 - 1667. Taunt

The large patch of black sky and the sight of the Pterodactyl reassured Noah. Night had done it. The creature had defeated Heaven and Earth’s cultivator, and it had brought a tinge of darkness into the world.

Harold didn’t know how to express himself. The night was filling his vision. He had never seen a world so dark, but the scene was too captivating to divert his eyes.

Instead, Noah watched that scene with a tinge of melancholy. His eyes saw the blackness, but that only depicted a small victory. He aimed to destroy the very essence of the whiteness, so he couldn’t feel satisfied with the small achievement.

Still, Noah patted Night’s strange body. The creature’s cultivation level fell, but it remained inside the middle tier. The Pterodactyl had advanced due to Noah’s potential, but its power couldn’t stay at the peak of the middle tier. It fell at the bottom of the level until it stabilized.

Night didn’t mind that. It knew that its power came from Noah’s ambition, so it accepted the decrease in cultivation level. It even remained with its head raised toward the sky while it watched the area remaining dark.

’The Demonic Sword will advance with me,’ Noah thought while summarizing the state of his companions. ’Snore still needs a bit, but Duanlong should be close. I need more energy. This world must grant me enough to improve my companions.’

Two of his companions had reached the middle tier. The parasite was an exception since it depended on Noah’s power, but Night and the others followed a normal cultivation journey.

Night had taken Noah’s potential to reach the middle tier and settle at that level. The process was necessary to defeat the light, and Noah didn’t regret using his law for that empowerment.

It didn’t matter how Noah used his law. He was already stronger than any gaseous stage hybrid and cultivator. His ambition could provide potential whenever he wanted.

"This is only the second lake," Noah exclaimed at some point. "We have far more to explore."

"Do you plan to destroy every settlement that follows Heaven and Earth?" Harold asked, but his voice carried doubts.

Harold didn’t know where he belonged. He wanted to join Heaven and Earth due to the immortality related to that action, but he had also seen Noah’s power.

The dark sky was a scene that very few experts recalled. It was almost impossible to fill the Immortal Lands with that blackness, but Noah had succeeded in the task.

Moreover, Noah didn’t use any trick. The blackness in the sky came from the pure absence of whiteness. Night had ensured that Heaven and Earth couldn’t reach that environment anytime soon, and Harold could only respect that feature.

"You are free," Noah eventually sighed while withdrawing the sword-shaped energy from Harold’s body. "I don’t care about your intentions. Just go if you want to remain within Heaven and Earth’s system."

Harold didn’t know how to answer that. He had almost made up his mind about being a slave, but Noah had suddenly freed him.

"Why?" Harold asked. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

He couldn’t utter any other word. Harold was speechless. Noah had done far more than any other leader. He had given total freedom to his underling, even if he knew that his action could lead to crises.

"It’s pointless to have puppets," Noah explained without moving his eyes from the sky. "You are yourself. Do what you want and join my organization when you feel like it. I don’t even mind if you turn me to the others. You can put the whole world against me as long as you force my existence to evolve."

Harold had no idea how to express himself. Conflicting feelings filled his mind. Part of him wanted to see where Noah’s path led, but other instincts only d.e.s.i.r.ed to obey Heaven and Earth.

The conflict in his mind ended up in a draw. Harold couldn’t decide which faction to support, so he followed his instincts. It only took an instant before he found himself filling cups of wine on the crumbled surface.

"I shall drink one to you, Noah Balvan," Harold exclaimed while raising his cup. "I want to oppose you, but you have given me experiences that my family couldn’t offer. I wish our situation were different."

Noah glanced toward Harold before taking one of the cups. The wine couldn’t do anything to his mental sphere, but Noah still hoped that the exchange could lead to something interesting.

Still, Noah felt disappointed to discover that nothing came in his direction. Heaven and Earth’s energy dispersed in the air and returned as part of the world. They didn’t care that Noah had won against Otto.

"How was it?" Noah asked while turning toward the Pterodactyl.

"I feel complete," Night replied. "I can destroy everything as long as it’s light. My hatred runs too deeply to know when to stop."

Noah didn’t know how to feel at that exclamation. His thoughts went in far different fields. He wanted to know how possible it was to transform his existence while being a rank 8 living hybrid.

The answer was obviously unclear. Noah knew far too well how dangerous it was to affect his existence. His very law and path depended on that, but he still wanted to change it.

"Let’s move," Noah eventually ordered, and the duo left.

Harold decided to explore cracks, but he didn’t find anything. The other side couldn’t offer much in its destroyed state, and Noah knew that far too well to waste time.

Noah watched as Harold made up his mind and followed him. Noah didn’t know what to say to his new underling, especially when it came to inspiring him. Still, he decided to be himself and let his existence flow into Harold.

"Let’s make a mess," Noah exclaimed while shooting forward.

He had nothing else to offer. Noah was chaos that Heaven and Earth had to fix, and he intended to remain like that. His existence also spread, and the world couldn’t do anything about that. Night had already created a black area where living beings could experience life without light.

"The sky here is clear," Noah announced, "But there are far more places in the world with whiteness. Let’s cover the sky with darkness until something big comes in our way. Actually, let’s do that in a few years."

"Are you serious?" Harold asked. "Why would you even test Heaven and Earth?"

"Challenges lead to improvements," Noah explained. "Also, I have something in mind already. I expect the world to give me a punishment once I complete my new project."

"How can you be so sure of that?" Harold asked.

"Heaven and Earth must be fair, even in their unfairness," Noah continued. "They can give you unsurmountable challenges, but they must give you enough time to prepare for that punishment. You see them as powerful existences, but they are nothing more than broken rulers in my mind."

Harold understood Noah’s speech. It was crazy, and it had countless flaws that only experts in Heaven and Earth’s system could accept. Yet, he made sense, and it also managed to inspire Harold.

Noah had seen an immortal liquid stage cultivator, but he had found a way out of that situation. The world had even suffered from his offensive. It was as if the higher plane had confirmed that Noah was right about his ideas, and Harold could only choose to follow him for the time being.
