Chapter 1124 1124. Hands

Noah didn’t hesitate for even an instant. As soon as the raw laws entered his mind’s range, his legs kicked the air to make him sprint toward that light.

His experience as a lone cultivator allowed him to act before the Royals, but they reacted rather quickly too at that sudden event.

Noah reached the lump of raw laws in less than a second, and he stretched his hand toward that white sphere of light to seize it. He didn’t know how to absorb that resource, but he trusted his body to handle that part.

However, a fireball landed on his arm right before he could close his fingers around the sphere. The explosion that followed pushed the raw laws away and made Noah lose his chance to seize them. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The Royals appeared in that spot immediately after the explosion, but Noah had already shot forward to go after the raw laws.

He didn’t care about the two powerhouses. Killing them in a mission where King Elbas was the leader wasn’t ideal. Also, the raw laws were more important than that.

The lump of light appeared distant again after the explosion pushed it away, but Noah instantly reached it. As long as it remained inside the range of his consciousness, the strange sense of distance in the void wouldn’t deceive him.

Another fireball exploded above Noah right before he could seize the white light. The raw laws shot downward at that point, and Noah followed after them.

"Let’s talk about this," First Princess conveyed as the two Royals chased after Noah. The latter didn’t stop, so she threw another attack to push the light away.

Noah felt annoyed seeing his target escaping from his grasp at the last second again. He suddenly stopped chasing after it to deal with the problem, and the two Royals immediately halted their flight at that sight.

They didn’t dare to come too close to him, and a chill ran down their spines when they saw him turning to fix his vertical pupils on them.

"Talk?" Noah said as he stared at the duo. He didn’t want to fight if possible, but there were silent rules that had to be respected.

"I’m stronger than both of you," Noah transmitted in a cold voice, "So I’ll take the raw laws."

The Royals had never lived without a backing. They didn’t know how things worked among lone cultivators. King Elbas wasn’t there to protect them, but Noah was still mindful of offending such a powerful existence. Moreover, he needed their tracking inscriptions to find other companions.

"You have come in this mission thanks to our Father!" First Prince shouted through his mind. "It’s only normal for the Elbas family to take the biggest share of the gains."

"Not the Elbas family," Noah replied. "King Elbas and he isn’t here. I only see two weaklings trying to use his name to seize something that they can’t obtain with their own hands."

Noah’s sharp words hurt the Royals’ pride, and First Prince almost launched an attack at him as rage filled his mind. However, First Princess grabbed his wrist to stop him.

"He wants us to use "Breath"," First Princess explained when her brother looked at her with a confused expression.

Noah revealed a cold smile when he sensed that. He didn’t care that First Prince didn’t fall for his taunt. He had already stated his superiority, so he could only send an ultimatum now.

"I’m going to seize the raw laws again," Noah conveyed as he turned. "Stop me, and I’ll take care of you two first."

The Royals watched him walking toward the white light. Noah could have reached it with a single leap, but he wanted the duo to decide how that situation would unfold.

First Princess revealed an ugly expression. She felt mocked by Noah’s actions, and her brother felt in the same way. Yet, he didn’t have her self-control.

First Prince saw Noah’s slow walk as a major insult. He felt as if the Demon Prince wanted him to drown in helplessness.

Blood fell from his eyes and facial pores as anger filled his whole being. His sister wanted to stop him, but it was too late to interrupt his spell.

The blood took fire and gave birth to an eight-armed titan. Golden runes shone on First Prince’s skin, and their halo teleported him on top of Noah before he launched his attack.

Noah had followed his actions with his consciousness, so the sudden appearance of the titan didn’t surprise him. Still, that course of events made him sigh.

Fighting the Royals and offending King Elbas were actions that he was willing to do if the situation required it. Yet, the fact that he couldn’t recover the darkness lost in the battle made him less inclined to fight.

Of course, First Prince had gone too far already. Now he could only blame himself for any unwanted consequence.

Noah blew toward the lump of white light to make it leave that area before charging at the eight-armed titan.

It would be easier to catch up with the raw laws if he pushed them. A battle among powerhouses would fling them far away, and they could even become too fast for him to reach them.

The giant had punched downward, but massive slashes appeared on its dense flames when Noah charged toward the descending limbs. Four arms fell apart by the time he reached the titan’s chest, where First Prince was.

Noah raised his finger and pointed it toward the Royal. His arm performed a quick thrust that opened a massive hole at the center of the titan’s body.

Golden light filled the area. First Prince felt speechless when he saw that three of his life-saving inscribed items had activated at the same time to fend off Noah’s attack.

’Always full of defenses,’ Noah cursed in his mind as the golden light shone on his face.

A massive shield, an array of runes, and a reinforced armor stood between him and the Royal. All of them radiated an aura at the peak of the lower tier.

Those items would usually make First Prince untouchable among powerhouses in the gaseous stage, but Noah only saw a challenge in those defenses.

His cultivation level didn’t show it, but he was the strongest among the newly advanced powerhouses. No one even came close to his power after the extensive training inside the Divine Cut’s aura.

First Prince quickly suppressed his astonishment and poured more blood inside the titan to refill the missing flames. Meanwhile, its remaining limbs threw fireballs at Noah in the hope of slowing him down.

Noah’s aura surged as he glanced at the fireballs, and his sharpness spread in the environment. His arms didn’t move, but the attacks divided themselves in half under the effect of his influence.

Then, Noah retracted his arm and stretched his fingers to make them take the form of a blade. First Prince felt an intense danger from that action, but his sister luckily interrupted Noah’s preparations.

A massive snake had formed around First Princess when she realized how strong Noah was. She knew the dangers of getting exhausted in that environment, but she couldn’t leave her brother alone.

The snake spewed a dense torrent of flames that reached her opponent right before he could launch his lunge. Noah had to leap upward to dodge the attack, but that gave the giant enough time to reform.

Eight fiery arms swung in Noah’s direction and threw fireballs. The blackness of the void had turned into a red environment in a matter of seconds, but Noah didn’t feel danger when seeing those flames.

"Let me out!" Night shouted inside Noah’s mind. "Let me kill their light!"

Noah ignored the Pterodactyl and arched his fingers to swing his arms multiple times. Massive black slashes came out of his hands and crashed on the fiery limbs, destroying them and forcing the Royal to retreat.

Night was perfect for that environment, and it didn’t even consume darkness in its current form. Its power came from the dark matter.

Nevertheless, Noah didn’t want to reveal its power just yet, and he still preferred to keep the Royals alive. His hands were enough to handle the situation.
