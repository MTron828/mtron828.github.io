Chapter 1610 - 1610. Help

The pyramid explained how it intended to make Noah and the others approach Great Builder’s resurrection. The procedure was extremely appealing for those experts. It would make them experience the creation of rank 9 items first-hand.

Inscription masters would pay any price to gain access to that knowledge. They would gain experience in the creation of items that stood at the peak of the cultivation journey. No one would even dare to refuse that offer.

Noah and the others felt the same. King Elbas was so excited about the whole procedure that he risked starting it before warning his allies.

The preparations for the resurrection began immediately. Noah and the other inscription masters involved during the procedure brought the army at the center of the third layer and made it wait for further dispositions.

The pyramid then proceeded to give more directions. It made Noah summon specific experts who were essential to the procedure due to their unique existence.

Noah summoned Divine Demon, Wilfred, Alexander, Luke, Theodora, and even a few magical beasts. The leader of the Foolery and some other creature in the eighth rank had to gather in the secret chamber before the procedure could start.

"We are ready," Noah announced once all the experts gathered among those invisible barriers.

The pyramid replied to his words by unleashing a series of earthquakes that spread through the whole structure. The dark-yellow bricks shook as walls, floors, and ceilings moved to create an inscription hall worthy of witnessing Great Builder’s resurrection.

The room containing Great Builder’s corpse descended toward the center of the pyramid. The structure had created a large empty area there, but waves of resources soon fell inside it.

A series of walls became transparent and allowed the rest of the army to watch the scene. The pyramid had even created stages from which the experts could inspect the whole procedure.

Noah and the others remained speechless. Countless materials in the eighth rank fell from tunnels that filled that immense dark-yellow hall. Those resources created proper waterfalls made of items that organizations would kill to obtain.

The clanging noises generated by the multicolored waterfalls stopped at some point. Then, a dense aura spread through the immense hall and attracted the experts’ attention.

Three oval cores that radiated a blinding white light came out of the tunnels and fell among the piles of resources. Their aura was almost able to suffocate the inscription masters and the experts on the stages. Even Alexander struggled to remain calm in front of those materials.

’Three fake cores in the ninth rank,’ Noah thought while studying those items.

His senses didn’t allow him to go past that suffocating aura, but he had no doubt. The pyramid contained three rank 9 fake cores, and it wanted to use them to resurrect its master.

An even denser aura then filled the dark-yellow hall. Noah and the others could sense the pyramid’s will trying to seep into their minds and desiring to take control of their bodies.

The experts were aware of that procedure. The pyramid had warned them. Noah and the others were too weak to handle the resurrection, and their knowledge was also unsuitable for the task. The structure had to take control of their bodies to empower their abilities.

Noah let the aura seep into his mind. A deep knowledge crossed his mental walls and fused with his mental sea, giving him an understanding of the procedure that he couldn’t obtain otherwise.

The other experts soon imitated Noah, and they immediately felt glad to be in that situation. The pyramid was giving them the understanding of a rank 9 existence. It was making them take a trip inside Great Builder’s mind.

Noah didn’t know how to express what he felt. He had been through a similar experience with Shandal’s thoughts, but the feelings generated by that experience made him partially change his view of the world.

Great Builder’s experience was immense. Very few experts had reached a similar level of knowledge, and even fewer had done that while stepping into the ninth rank.

The world in Noah’s eyes had changed. He didn’t see materials or resources anymore. There were only laws in his vision, and Noah could instinctively understand which item they created through their structure.

His eyes also told him how to transform those laws into actual living beings. Great Builder seemed fond of improving everything in the world. He could see lifeforms in every material that entered his vision.

Noah felt strange. A peculiar power had slowly begun to run through his veins. He was stronger than ever, but that power didn’t belong to him, so he didn’t let it trigger his instincts.

The power forced his body to move against his will. Noah and the other inscription masters raised their hands and chanted hymns toward the incredible expert they wanted to resurrect.

The pyramid even made them express their laws during the process. Noah’s ambition, King Elbas’ curiosity, Alexander’s hunger, Divine Demon’s desire to win, and many other peculiar laws flowed through the inscription hall and fused with the heavy aura.

The aura slightly changed after absorbing those influences. It empowered those different laws and created ethereal copies of the experts who had taken the role of inscription masters.

Noah’s vision went dark for an instant before everything became clear again. Yet, he didn’t find himself in his body. His whole figure had turned ethereal during that short moment.

The same had happened to the other inscription masters. Their consciousness moved on the ethereal figures generated by the aura. They had become products of the pyramid after that process.

The pyramid had explained that too. Noah and the others needed to oversee the procedure, but they couldn’t do it in their real bodies. Neither of them carried enough power to handle the resurrection of the ninth rank existence.

"Let’s do this," Noah eventually announced once every ethereal figure began to move.

The massive wave of knowledge that had flown inside their minds had taught them how to proceed. The ethereal figures even removed their physical limits. Noah and the others could go all-out and perform inscriptions meant to build rank 9 resources.

Great Builder’s corpse was the core material behind the resurrection. However, it was far from enough. The expert’s centers of power had suffered too much during the eras spent without using them.

The pyramid wanted to rebuild the centers of power. Great Builder had to be the last creation of the workshop, and he even had to go beyond the usual standards of those products.

Great Builder had to resurrect as a rank 9 existence that carried all his previous abilities and power. The pyramid even wanted the expert to come out better than before, but Noah didn’t bother to overthink that. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The experts immediately started the procedure. They waved their hands, and countless materials began to melt.

The piles of resources transformed into multicolored pools that rose inside the hall to create dark pillars. Those structures then sent the power inside Great Builder’s body and began to awaken his stagnant centers of power.

The three rank 9 fake cores eventually rose, but they remained in front of the inscription masters as if waiting for them to pick them.

Noah would love to seize one of those items, but his very survival depended on the success of the mission. It didn’t take him much to understand what to do, and the dark world soon came out of his real body to fill the entire hall.
