’They are scared.’

Noah thought when he saw that Amos was willing to use an oath in the fifth rank just to include Daniel in their team.

Flying Demon shot a glance toward his lover, but Dreaming Demon just shook her head.

The Hive couldn’t trust such an inscribed item so quickly, and it wasn’t ready to reveal the existence of the separate dimension to the world.

The tunnel was the perfect tool to ambush enemies without leaving any trace, and the elders were sure that they could use it to take advantage of certain situations.

Yet, they also needed the information of the Udye family to know the exact layout of the Utra nation.

"We’ll need to inspect it."

Dreaming Demon said after a short moment of silence.

Both Amos and the group from the Hive were hesitant, but the latter didn’t strictly need to complete that task.

On the other hand, the Cause would be powerless against the assets of the Elbas family without the help of the fourth force in the Mortal Lands.

One side had to take a leap of faith, but the Hive didn’t need to be that side.

In the end, Amos handed the token to Dreaming Demon, and she gave it to her lover, who returned to the garden.

One of the nobles accompanied him, but Flying Demon simply disappeared inside the separate dimension, carrying the token with him.

The other cultivators waited in silence for his return, but Noah and the elder knew that it would take at least half an hour for their companion to contact Thirty-seven and make him analyze the token.

There were ways to break oaths, and the automaton had to make sure that there wasn’t a method prepared beforehand.

Noah continued to study the map during that silence, and he completely ignored the curious glances that Daniel, Ian, and Octavia shot toward him.

The fact that Noah had reached the liquid stage in those few years was just one of the many surprises that his figure hid.

His body had reached the fifth rank, and there seemed to be an incredible amount of energy contained in it.

Also, his mental sphere was far more potent than before, and even Amos was surprised to notice that it was nearing the peak of the fourth rank.

All of that while Noah wasn’t even sixty.

Daniel didn’t even try to probe Noah with his mental energy since the latter was surrounded by a sharp aura that threatened to destroy everything that came near him.

That alone made him realize that Noah had increased the distance between them even further.

’Asking about the Balvan mansion is easy, but how do I learn more about the Ballor family without making them suspect anything?’

Noah thought as he pondered about that issue.

Almost everyone in the world knew about his hatred toward his family, but only the elders were aware of his relationship with June.

Noah wanted to keep it that way for now since they had both agreed on that part, but he still wanted to find a way to see her.

However, the branch of the Ballor family was on the new continent, so he couldn’t be sure that the Udye family knew its exact position now.

’I wonder if I can use Daniel for that.’

Noah continued to think in silence until the doors of Amos’ training area opened again, and Flying Demon returned to the meeting.

His simple nod was enough to confirm that the token was fine and that they could take Daniel with them. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Of course, the Demons didn’t hold back in their conditions.

Daniel would be able to talk about the results obtained, but the oath would force him to keep everything else a secret.

The conditions covered the discussions that he heard during their missions too, meaning that Noah and the elders could even speak freely in his presence.

Amos didn’t care about those strict conditions, and Daniel seemed quite eager to join the group.

After all, the Udye family only needed to know that the Hive wasn’t planning something behind their backs.

They would never dare to scheme against an organization that had a rank 6 existence in its lead.

Amos revealed the coordinates of the Carner family when Daniel sealed the oath, and the four of them immediately returned to the separate dimension after that.

"How did you obtain something like that?"

Daniel asked when the insides of the tunnel appeared in his view.

Noah and the Demons didn’t answer him and simply turned their gazes toward the ethereal man that was taking form on the brown ground.

Thirty-seven already knew what he had to do.

He flew toward the noble and began to analyze him thoroughly.

Daniel was initially surprised by that sudden event, but the cold gazes of the three heroic cultivators next to him forced him to stay still.

"He’s clear, and the oath will cover everything."

Thirty-seven returned inside the fabric of the dimension after he said that, and Daniel could finally relax at those words.

"I don’t understand why did they send you. This is not exactly a training mission."

Flying Demon complained as soon as the automaton disappeared, but Noah quickly solved his doubt.

"He has a light aptitude. He is the banner of the Cause."

Daniel wanted to retort, but Dreaming Demon had even sharper comments about that matter.

"I see. Your family hopes that you can start to resemble our Prince. Good luck with that."

The two Demons were unaware of the details behind the Udye family.

They only knew that it was the most powerful noble family outside of the control of the Royals.

Yet, now they understood that there had to be some sort of relationship between Noah and Daniel.

"I won’t become like him. I just need experience."

Daniel answered, and Flying Demon could only shake his head at that reply.

Daniel was older than Noah, but he had lived a comfortable life.

His family had trained him well and provided him with everything he needed, but he was aware that he was lacking in many aspects.

"Do what you want. However, you must make yourself useful since you joined our group. You’ll help the human assets in clearing the Carner mansion while I take care of the fake heroic cultivator."

Noah ordered as he moved toward the north of the dimension.

The Hive had the coordinates of the Carner family, but it still had to make the dimension reach the area under it, and Daniel couldn’t see them doing that.

The oath prevented him from speaking about what he learnt there, but he could still use that knowledge to plan strategies in the future.

So, he couldn’t learn how it worked.

"Wait! I can help you. Why should I fight against human cultivators?"

Daniel complained, but a pair of cold gazes landed on his figure when he questioned Noah’s orders.

The Demons instinctively felt angry when they saw Daniel’s lack of respect, but Noah’s next words made them reveal a smirk and relax the pressure that they were radiating.

"Because I say so."
