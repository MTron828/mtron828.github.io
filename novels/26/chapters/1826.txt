Chapter 1827 - 1827. Noise

Everyone in the pit became able to move again after the many rank 9 dragons died, but no one dared to say anything. Even the stronger creatures near the bottom of the hole remained still and kept their gazes on the three leaders.

The long-necked dragon didn’t appear happy about the event. Transparent tears that made the silver shade of her scales shine fell from its round eyes ran through its huge body. The ground opened when they touched the surface, and energy flowed into those spots to give birth to large white eggs.

Instead, the slim black dragon gave voice to a rough laugh that spread through the entirety of the region and made the dust created by the dead creatures flow toward its figure. Its scales began to release a dark halo as debris entered its nostril. The leader seemed able to feed on those valueless materials.

Noah and the others remained completely in awe of the power shown by the green dragon, but a wave of regret soon filled his mind. The leader had killed hundreds of rank 9 creatures in a single blow, but it didn’t leave behind any corpses. He would have been able to reach the ninth rank in a single eating session if he could have gained access to those magical beasts.

Wilfred and Alexander soon reached the same conclusions. The three hybrids couldn’t help to exchange a helpless glance before shaking their heads and accept that they couldn’t influence that situation.

The green dragon didn’t seem happy about his actions. The rust on the edges of its scales spread and tried to dim their shades, but resolve soon filled the creature’s large eyes and made it launch a wave of transparent flames toward the sky.

The sudden attack carried the entirety of the dragon’s power, but the latter made sure to contain its aura until the flames reached the storms high in the sky.

An explosion inevitably resounded once the flames touched the storms. The gales of chaotic laws began to vanish as the massive attack shattered their fabric and turned them into nothing more than primary energy.

The flames raged forward until they pierced the entirety of the storms and flew toward the white layer that marked the end of the sky. A high-pitched noise resounded after the impact and echoed through the passage created by the attack to spread inside the windless area.

The noise was sickening. Noah, his group, and the rest of the dragons did their best to cover their ears or seal their senses when the high-pitched sound reached them. However, they quickly realized that the event wasn’t something that their centers of power could stop. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The high-pitched sound entered their figures and tried to destabilize their fabric. Noah felt his skin, muscles, bones, and organs shaking as they tried to disperse that foreign influence. Still, they failed to succeed.

Injuries opened on their bodies. Only the middle tier dragons deeper into the hole managed to suppress part of that tremors, but even they saw large cracks spreading through their scales. Meanwhile, the weaker creatures had it worse. They had to witness entire pieces of their bodies falling toward the ground and exploding into bloody pulps.

Noah and his group had it far worse. Their bodies couldn’t even begin to oppose those tremors. They didn’t even feel what was causing that event. Their minds were unable to sense the energy that was making their very fabric shake.

Pieces of their bodies fell apart. Bones broke, and muscles shattered. Robert even experienced the complete detachment of some internal organs.

The group was about to die. Everything happened so quickly that they didn’t even manage to cast abilities before ending up in a condition that didn’t allow them to muster their energy.

Noah’s black hole usually acted on its own, but the organ seemed unable to deploy the dark matter contained in its insides due to the instabilities that ran through its structure. The situation was hopeless. He was about to die because an upper tier creature in the ninth rank had decided to attack the sky.

Yet, the tremors suddenly vanished. Noah, his group, and the other dragons didn’t do anything to make that event stop, but their fabric stopped shaking anyway.

Their figures stopped moving again at that point. Noah couldn’t even roll his eyes or inspect his surroundings. The bloody pulps that had acc.u.mulated under him quickly condensed until they took the shape of the flesh that had separated from him. Then, those body parts fused back with his structure.

The others on the pit were going through the same events. Their bodies reverted to the state before the arrival of the high-pitched noise. Time flowed backward and healed them in mere instants.

Noah couldn’t help but breathe roughly when he became able to move again. He felt tired and older. His appearance didn’t change, but his black hole sensed that his flesh had gone through many years of life in mere seconds.

’We are damned puppets among gods!’ Noah cursed in his mind as his helplessness turned into anger.

Noah wasn’t even a rank 9 existence, but he was in the middle of creatures that could shatter and rebuild him with a mere thought. That realm was too far away, but he only confirmed that escaping had never been an option after witnessing the leader’s power.

’I hope they don’t expect us to do anything relevant,’ Noah snorted in his mind. ’They can literally bend time! Why would they even need our help?’

"That’s what Heaven and Earth are," The green dragon’s ancient voice suddenly resounded inside the hole. "They are a force meant to kill everything in the world, but we are the same in their eyes. Fighting until a winner appears is our only option."

The dragons didn’t try to argue anymore. They wanted to save the trapped leader anyway, and the sudden show of power only made them agree with the matter even further. Still, they didn’t expect a wave of black flames to fly from behind them and fill the sky after the speech ended.

King Elbas and the others glared at Noah. Pure bewilderment filled their faces as they stared at their leader spitting a wave of flames that created a huge sea in the sky. It was clear that he wanted to claim everyone’s attention, but they didn’t understand the reason behind that gesture.

The other dragons were the same. It was fine for other rank 9 creatures in the pack to voice complaints or take a direct approach to the meeting, but Noah was only a rank 8 existence. In their minds, he should feel lucky enough to be in the same area as rank 9 magical beasts.

Noah had a completely different view of the matter. The leaders didn’t hesitate to kill underlings, so they wouldn’t mind sending him toward certain death either. Hence, he would do everything in his power to benefit his journey as much as possible, even if he risked dying in the process.

The three leaders couldn’t help but shoot surprised glances toward Noah. His companions immediately jumped backward when they sensed the three intense auras focusing on their position, and Noah slowly stopped spitting flames before glancing at the three creatures at the bottom of the pit.

"What is it, cub?" The long-necked dragon asked.

"Can I get a real explanation here?" Noah asked in a plain voice as if he were speaking to one of his companions. "I got that some of you are special, but I’d rather understand why before deciding to help."
