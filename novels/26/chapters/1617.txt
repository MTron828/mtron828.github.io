Chapter 1619 - 1619. Save

Radiant Eyes struggled as her body reverted to a normal human form. Even her eyes shrunk at some point and became small red dots immersed in Great Builder’s whiteness.

Shouts, curses, and, eventually, pleas filled the sky. Radiant Eyes expressed her desire to live and tried to seal deals with Great Builder, but her opponent never let her go.

Great Builder’s grasp tightened as his aura succeeded in corroding her skin. His fingers then went past her muscles until they reached her bones.

It was hard to kill rank 9 existences, especially those with a hybrid body. Yet, Great Builder seemed able to suppress Radiant Eyes’ entire existence in his final form. He had transformed into her worst enemy, and he didn’t show any mercy.

Her bones eventually gave in, and Radiant Eyes’ body separated from her head. Great Builder didn’t bother to stop it from falling. He only raised his free hand and continued his corrosion on his opponent’s face.

Radiant Eyes was still alive even if most of her body had fallen on the ground. She was nothing more than a talking head, but Great Builder soon took care of that issue.

Great Builder’s hands dug through her face until they turned it into nothing more than dust. A sigh then escaped his mouth as his whiteness dimmed, and his peculiar aura vanished.

His new transformation had allowed him to suppress a hybrid and kill it with his bare hands. However, that was only a temporary form obtained after gathering information on his opponent.

Great Builder had managed to turn his existence into Radiant Eyes’ worst enemy, and he had used his new advantages to kill her in a few moves.

The workshops and puppets stopped working after Radiant Eyes died. The few remaining bees also collapsed on the ground and died on the destroyed surface. Their bodies even started to lose all the empowerment obtained through their leader’s aura.

Something strange happened to the world. A large chunk of the sky shattered as Radiant Eyes’ influence vanished. That tainted matter couldn’t keep existing after their core died.

"Some of them can’t live past death," Great Builder sighed while turning toward Noah and the others. "It’s incredible that she had reached this level without leaving a permanent trace of her life. I guess that inscribed item was her whole world." Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The magical plants that had protected the army retreated into the ground. Noah and the others were finally free to leave the area, but most of them didn’t dare to move.

Only the magical beasts leapt over the cracks left by the magical plants and shot toward Radiant Eyes’ corpse. They couldn’t contain their instincts in front of such a priceless meal.

"Where are you even going?" Noah said through a chilling roar.

His pride flew inside his mental waves and reached the running magical beasts. Those creatures suddenly stopped when they sensed how angry Noah was about that development. They could immediately realize that Noah wouldn’t hesitate to kill them if they took another step.

"Come back here," Noah roared, and most of the magical beasts flew back.

A few creatures remained in the distance. Their instincts were a mess, and a violent battle between their hunger and Noah’s pride happened in their mind.

Noah quickly teleported among those magical beasts. The creatures lowered their head, but some of them continued to glance toward the rank 9 corpse.

"Evolve past your hunger," Noah said through a growl. "You can’t eat that body anyway."

His ambition flowed inside those hesitant creatures and brought some clarity to their mind. All of them managed to calm down, but none of them raised their head even at that point.

"What did I tell you about bowing?" Noah snorted, and a second wave of chilling aura spread from his figure.

Noah was ready to take care of those magical beasts. He valued stability a lot, but those creatures had already demonstrated their loyalty. One of them had even offered itself to refill his centers of power during the events inside the pyramid.

Noah wanted to try a peaceful approach before resorting to his usual slashing. He preferred to save those magical beasts if possible. After all, they were his underlings.

The magical beasts slowly raised their head. Noah could finally notice their expressions, and he saw nothing more than shame on their faces.

"Go back to the army," Noah ordered. "I have the faint feeling that someone wants to talk."

Noah glanced toward the descending Great Builder. The expert was slowly losing all the empowerment obtained during the battle. His body reverted to a normal human figure, but the white light continued to flow out of his skin anyway.

"Your feeling is on point," Great Builder announced while landing on the ground next to him.

"Do all rank 9 existences become invincible during a long battle?" Noah probed the expert’s law.

"No one is invincible," Great Builder explained. "Even Heaven and Earth can fall."

The hungry magical beasts eventually turned to run back toward the army. Instead, the various leaders in Noah’s group left their underlings and flew toward him.

Wilfred, Theodora, King Elbas, Jordan, Ian, Alexander, Fergie, and all the other rank 8 existences in the army flew toward Noah. They wouldn’t miss that chance to talk with a rank 9 cultivator out of fear.

"I’m surprised you managed to clear the pyramid," Great Builder announced once everyone gathered around him. "Part of me only wanted to protect my items."

Jokes appeared in the expert’s mind, but no one dared to speak. Great Builder seemed friendly, but Noah and the others didn’t know how much they could trust him.

"Heaven and Earth won’t let this slide," Great Builder continued. "One of you has already attracted their wrath without reaching the ninth rank. I expect all of you to get the permanent curse in the next months."

"Why months?" Noah suddenly asked. "Why won’t Heaven and Earth activate the curse immediately?"

"Do you think they have been unfair toward you?" Great Builder asked while revealing a smile.

"I only want to understand them better," Noah calmly replied. "You aren’t the only one who wants to destroy them."

"This explains why they gave you this punishment so soon," Great Builder laughed. "It will only get worse. The sparks are only the beginning of the curse."

"I have also faced humanoid beings made of lightning bolts," Noah added.

Great Builder arched his eyebrow. He had to admit that Noah appeared unique even among experts who had managed to clear his pyramid.

"You are the existence with four centers of power!" Great Builder eventually shouted. "The addition of the organ is flawless. You managed to surprise me."

Noah didn’t know what to answer. He had vaguely suspected that Great Builder knew about his existence since he had resurrected him. Still, Noah didn’t expect the cultivator to talk about that so openly.

"Perks of being a hybrid," Noah limited himself to reply.

"Indeed, but you lose something once you reach the peak of the food chain," Great Builder sighed. "I could have transformed myself long ago, but my existence focuses on the various aspects of life. Gaining access to your physical strength would only make me lose interest in that."

"Are you afraid that you could lose your path?" Noah asked.

"We grow stronger by fixing our weaknesses," Great Builder explained. "Reaching a stable state near perfection is the doom of every researcher. I need my human flaws to remain an amazing cultivator."

Noah fell silent, but he didn’t move his gaze away from Great Builder. He had asked a different question before, but the expert had yet to answer it.

"Oh, right," Great Builder said. "Well, they have many worlds to sustain. The lower planes don’t require much energy, but the Immortal Lands and the Cities in the sky put a lot of pressure on Heaven and Earth. They need to save power for a few months before applying another curse."
