Chapter 1307 1307. Ascension

Noah’s centers of power had reached the seventh rank. His dark matter had also evolved, and he had already created a temporary training method for his mind. He only needed to fill the spherical rune with primary energy to complete it.

He had already improved his spells and created a separate space where he could store divine items. The lower plane’s frailty prevented him from testing and developing new techniques, but Noah wouldn’t hesitate to approach that project after his ascension.

His companions had also reached the divine ranks. Snore, the Demonic Sword, and Night were proper rank 7 creatures now. It was unclear whether a lower plane had ever contained so many divine beings.

Noah had also completed the inheritance ground and put an end to his relationship with Second Prince. His friends in the other Mortal Lands would get the chance to colonize the main world again once the Royal restored the dimensional portal.

Noah couldn’t do anything else in the lower plane since he had completed every preparation. It was time to ascend.

Wild emotions surged in Noah’s mind as he approached the sky. His mental waves made sure that his condition was at its peak as he stared at the faint tunnel on the other side of the world’s fabric.

Familiar emotions filled Noah’s mind and made him recall memories from his past as a lone cultivator. He was about to enter the last known stage of the cultivation journey. The final phase of his adventures was in front of him.

Noah’s consciousness unfolded, and his mental waves seeped in the world’s fabric. His thoughts carried a simple intention. He expressed his willingness to leave the lower plane.

A crack soon opened in the sky, and white light filled Noah’s vision as he stared at the world inside the fissure. A captivating aura seeped out of that passage, but his mind fended off its properties and allowed Noah to remain calm.

Noah didn’t turn to glance one last time at the world that had been his home for more than three thousand years. He knew what he would leave behind, and he felt no hesitation on the matter.

His existence couldn’t be in that place anymore. It was too small and frail for a god. Noah wouldn’t feel any attachment toward a world that rejected him due to his power.

The whiteness of the Immortal Lands shone in his eyes. Noah could hear Night’s annoyed complaints inside his mind, but the creature tried its best to suppress its anger.

Even the Pterodactyl understood what Noah’s ascension meant. He would instantly go from the peak of the food chain to its bottom once he reached the Immortal Lands. The time for games was over. Its instincts had to remain sharp and ready to face any threat.

’One step closer to the stars,’ Noah thought before crossing the fissure.

The scenery in his vision became chaotic, but Noah soon regained his focus. He found himself in a sturdier version of King Elbas’ dimensional tunnel, and the blackness of the void surrounded the structure.

That tunnel didn’t apply any protection against the void. It was a thick array of white lines that radiated a heavy aura. Noah soon noticed that he couldn’t move his body due to that pressure.

Noah’s individuality became unstable inside the void. It tried to come out of his figure and disperse in that strange environment. However, his mental waves soon enveloped his body and forced his existence to regain some stability.

He was a god now. The unique properties of the void couldn’t affect his existence anymore. Noah could fly through that blackness freely if he desired.

The white tunnel forced Noah to fly forward, and it even made him accelerate as time passed. Noah couldn’t expand his consciousness past the structure, so he could only focus on the endless array of lines that filled his vision.

There was something mystical about those lines. Noah could inspect them with his mind, but he didn’t sense any peculiar aura coming out of them.

The tunnel contained common laws. It was a natural creation that didn’t carry any external influence. It was no different from a river or a mountain when it came to the simplicity of its structure.

The white light was the only peculiar aspect of that structure. It came from the lines, but its aura transformed after it touched the void.

It was a strange transformation that happened after the light left the lines. Noah couldn’t understand that process. It happened on a level that went deeper than laws. It was similar to them but also completely different.

That simple event made Noah aware that he was approaching a higher world. He went from understanding every process around him to being unable to study the first strange phenomenon that he saw.

Noah flew for entire weeks. He couldn’t calculate the passage of time in that strange environment, but he could see that the white light became more intense as the days passed.

The strangeness of the environment kept Noah entertained for a while. Everything was new for him, so he couldn’t grow bored of that light. Also, his companions often spoke and discussed, so he wasn’t completely alone.

The tunnel abruptly ended at some point. Noah suddenly regained control of his body only to see an immense white plain filling his vision. Then, he felt an intense gravitational pull dragging him toward that landmass.

Noah couldn’t do anything to oppose that force. Even his divine power wasn’t enough to fend off that gravitational pull off. He could only accelerate toward the whiteness and do his best to control his speed.

His eyes slowly adapted to that light, but he still couldn’t see anything outside of the whiteness. Yet, he could understand that the landmass wasn’t a simple immense continent. It was a giant planet.

’The Immortal Lands!’ Noah exclaimed in his mind as he tried to understand as much as possible of that world.

He couldn’t see the entirety of the planet from his position, and the white halo prevented him from gazing at the environment behind that massive world. However, he could notice a few black spots on that mass of whiteness.

Noah couldn’t be sure of that, but those spots resembled holes carved in that whiteness. One of them was right under him, and Noah was flying toward it.

’They must be entrances connected to other Mortal Lands,’ Noah guessed as the gravitational pull forced him to accelerate toward the hole under him.

A heavy pressure landed on his mind when he crossed the hole. Noah couldn’t even keep his eyes open, and he had to condense his consciousness to protect his mental sphere from that external force.

The pressure became less intense as he continued to fall, and even his speed diminished. When he managed to open his eyes, Noah noticed an azure land filled with plants that he had never seen before.

Noah crouched and landed on the ground. The sturdy terrain of the Immortal Lands remained stable during the crash. Not even a crack opened on its uneven surface.

That sight felt refreshing for Noah. He had finally reached a world that could withstand his power, and he couldn’t wait to explore it.

However, before he could unfold his consciousness to study the area, a dangerous sensation appeared in his mind and forced him to turn.

’I’ve grown tired of snakes,’ Noah thought when he saw a giant creature lifting its reptilian head to the sky and fixing its eyes on him.
