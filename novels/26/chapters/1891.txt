Chapter 1892 1892. Orders

"I believe it will be different for all of you," Alexander explained as his eyes moved among Divine Demon, Noah, and King Elbas, "Especially you three."

His words didn’t carry any mockery or insults. Wilfred, Robert, Steven, and Sword Saint knew that their laws were relatively simple compared to those three experts.

Divine Demon could accomplish miracles with the help of the world, King Elbas was an even vaster version of Alexander, and Noah was Noah. Their potential was boundless, and that would inevitably affect their breakthrough to the ninth rank.

"What we concluded with Lord Lewis has been quite correct," Alexander continued while lifting his palm to show a small tongue of scarlet flames.

Different energies flowed toward the flame and altered its power. Alexander made sure to show the effects that mental energy, "Breath", and primary energy had on the ability so that the experts could notice when he called upon a different power. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The mental energy only made the flame flicker, the primary energy expanded it, and the "Breath" made it far bigger than before. Those were natural reactions that the experts could immediately recognize. After all, that fire was a simple innate ability seized by a magical beast. They knew exactly how they worked.

A different type of energy started flowing through Alexander’s hand after the hybrid finished the initial demonstration. That power felt ethereal but haughty. It carried an intense feeling even if it were hard to study.

The flame didn’t only expand when that energy flowed inside its structure. It went through a qualitative change that transformed its scarlet color into a pale-red blinding radiance.

The fire wasn’t a simple fire anymore. It became so intense that the expert had to take a step back to endure the heatwaves that it radiated. The inspection slowly revealed something else about its features. The flames had retained their nature, but they had reached a realm that didn’t exist in the world. Even specific abilities from cultivators who used flames couldn’t achieve that sheer level of power.

"My law is superiority," Alexander explained. "I can apply to all the abilities that I have seized throughout my life, and the same goes to my physical strength and mental prowess. In short, I express my innate role in the food chain."

Noah and the others couldn’t help but find everything highly suitable to Alexander and his journey. He had gone from being a hybrid cursed by his own power to the best possible specimen once those flaws vanished.

Alexander had stepped on the last part of his journey. All the experiences amassed in his life had converged to create the current state of his law, but he could still improve it. He had seized his throne among the hybrids, but those creatures weren’t the only living beings in the world.

"The storms hide many monsters," Alexander eventually sighed. "I-."

"Go," Noah interrupted the hybrid before he could finish his phrase. "We are past the need to group up to survive impossible threats. The purpose of the storms is to complete our path, so go and complete it."

"Noah," Alexander gasped before clearing his throat, "You might still need me. I can delay my departure for a few millennia."

"Nonsense," Noah snorted. "Cancer isn’t an organization that suppresses its underlings. We strive to take down the sky. We can’t put any limit to our growth."

The other experts remained silent during that interaction. Some didn’t understand the topic, others didn’t care enough to say anything, and a few managed to sense the deep meaning carried by those words.

Alexander had found his superiority when he reached the ninth rank. Yet, he needed to build on top of it, which meant proving his law in front of other worthy opponents.

The stormy regions were full of strange, unique, and powerful beings that met those requirements, but Alexander hesitated to leave for multiple reasons. He didn’t want to leave his companions alone right after making Heaven and Earth angry while they were still in the eighth rank. Also, he felt that he didn’t spend much time with those grand experts, so he regretted departing so soon.

A normal organization in that situation would force its members to stick together. Seven peak rank 8 experts and one rank 9 hybrid didn’t make a powerful force inside the stormy regions. Noah and the others had seen packs featuring upper tier specimens and armies with solid stage cultivators in the span of a few centuries during their travels through the winds. Their joint power didn’t appear worthy of recognition in that environment.

The weakness of an organization was often the reason behind the decision to make its members stick together, but Noah had the opposite mindset. The power of his force had never come from the high number of underlings. Its foundation was on the few exceptional beings who could ignore common labels and go beyond what the world considered mandatory limits.

Moreover, Noah couldn’t stand the idea of an organization suppressing its underlings. He had spent a meaningful part of his life fighting and overcoming similar forces. He had proven how flawed they were even before stepping on the divine ranks.

In his mind, Alexander had to follow his path and return once he fulfilled it. That was the meaning behind the cultivation journey, and the experts had to face it on their own. There was no way around it. Otherwise, June would be with them now.

"Do you have some last orders, Defying Demon?" Alexander sighed before wearing a proud smile.

Alexander had been one of the few experts standing today with Noah who had accepted his leadership without voicing any complaint. His situation had been special since his mental condition had made him prioritize finding a successor, but he had never stopped to respect Noah, even after the ghosts in his mind vanished.

Noah liked Alexander’s character. The hybrid had developed a humility that most divine existences lacked after spending millennia submerged in the drawbacks of his power. It had taken him the breakthrough to the ninth rank to retrieve the pride in his ability, but he still didn’t show any arrogance toward Noah.

"Don’t die," Noah chuckled, "Don’t switch sides, and don’t be late for the final battle if we end up remaining apart until then."

"That sounds easy to follow," Alexander laughed.

"Oh right," Noah exclaimed as he recalled something. "Make sure to reach the peak. I have the faint sensation that the last battle will be bloody. We need as many powerful experts as possible."

"I would have done that even without your orders," Alexander laughed again.

"I know," Noah shrugged his shoulders, "But maybe my ambition will help if I say something. Well, I suspect I’ll learn more about my law after reaching the ninth rank."

"I’m pretty sure something will notify me about your breakthrough," Alexander laughed to cover his obvious compliment.

"I don’t even want to think about my requirements," Noah cursed. "I’ll probably have to do something crazy again just to meet the requirements of my body."

"The sky is always there," Alexander hinted at the vast amount of energy contained inside the white layer.

"It is indeed," Noah sighed while raising his head to stare at the sky clouded by the orange halo of the city. "How is it? How does the ninth rank feel?"

Alexander also raised his eyes toward the sky while thinking about that question. An answer came up in his mind, and he smiled when he realized how fitting it was for his leader.

"Cramped," Alexander explained, and Noah’s gaze couldn’t help but intensify.
