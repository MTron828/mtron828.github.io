Chapter 1727 - 1727. Marks

"I can see the Elbas’ blood now," June commented after Kirk’s line.

Noah and King Elbas ignored her to study those marks. They could sense that the various traces of life belonged to different creatures, but Kirk’s existence seemed to be the core of their life.

"It’s a special feature of his higher energy," King Elbas explained while placing his hand on one of the marks. "Interesting. His earth can replicate life and trap it into his existence. It’s similar to Alexander’s ability, except for the drawbacks. He pays them before obtaining a new power."

Kirk couldn’t help but feel surprised at the accuracy of King Elbas’ explanation. The expert had inspected him for mere seconds, but he had already understood many core parts of his law.

"Higher energy that learns from lifeforms," Noah said. "A power that imitates features of the world and turns them into your abilities. Can you ignore the limits of your element?"

"Partially," Kirk revealed. "The earth element is still stronger since my existence naturally tends toward that power. Also, my centers of power can’t endure too many marks, so I have to choose which abilities to keep carefully."

"I bet you use the Elemental Forging method to imprint them into your body," Noah said while sniffing the various marks. "I can smell your greed for power. Do you want to turn yourself into the perfect being?"

"The higher plane is the perfect hunting ground," Kirk announced. "I can find the best abilities here and fuse them with my existence while my capacity increases."

Kirk seemed unable to hide the secrets behind his existence under Noah’s probing. He respected his Master too much to attempt to lie to him. The inheritance had changed his life, so Noah would get all the answers he wanted. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

"I’m glad that you didn’t rely too much on my techniques," Noah announced. "Developing a law that completely reflects your existence is crucial for the cultivation journey."

Kirk nodded. He felt as if he was in a dream. His Master was praising his efforts. The meeting couldn’t have gone better.

"You can throw him in a pack of dragons now," Noah said while clenching his grip on Kirk’s arm.

"What?!" Kirk’s expression froze for the third time, and worry filled his mind when he saw Divine Demon getting close.

"Why would you want to do that?" King Elbas asked while wearing a blank expression.

"I want to see what he is really like," Noah snorted. "Words are useless."

Noah gave voice to a roar, and Jordan quickly flew toward him. The two of them exchanged a few words before she rose in the sky and started summoning a few hybrids and magical beasts.

"Make way!" Noah roared to force the various experts busy celebrating away. "I’m going to punch the ground even if you are still here."

Cries began to fill the regions but laughs eventually spread when the massive group saw Noah dragging Kirk toward an empty spot.

Noah punched the ground, making sure that the shockwaves of his attack didn’t spread through the region. A large area immediately crumbled, and his higher energy covered the hole to define the borders of that battlefield.

"Good luck!" Noah said in his human voice before throwing Kirk into the hole.

Kirk wanted to complain and use his abilities, but Noah’s pressure prevented his attempts to leave the hole. The expert had to go through that event before regaining his freedom.

Divine Demon laughed as he sat next to Noah. June shook her head before imitating the expert and taking out a few jugs of wine. Alexander and the other existences who had known Noah for a long time quickly arrived on the edges of the hole and joined the trio.

Cups and more jugs came out of the storage spaces. The experts began to drink while Jordan made sure to create a trial for the cultivator. Meanwhile, Kirk stared at the tall edges of the hole in confusion. He didn’t expect that development at all.

Jordan eventually returned, and a small group of hybrids, cultivators, and magical beasts followed her. They were all experts in the liquid stage of the seventh rank, and they didn’t hesitate to descend into the hole to prepare for the imminent battle.

"Dragons have more style," Divine Demon commented while emptying his cup.

"These areas are completely devoid of magical beasts," June sighed. "Did you even listen to our summary?"

"I have never listened in my life!" Divine Demon shouted.

"That’s literally impossib-," June tried to complain, but Noah placed a hand on her shoulder and shook his head.

"Battle!" The Foolery shouted from the edges of the hole, and Kirk didn’t know what to think when he saw that a tall winged pig was part of the audience.

"Master?" Kirk said in a pleading voice, but Noah didn’t budge.

"I want to see how strong you are," Noah explained. "Also, lone cultivators aren’t so polite. You can drop your act now. Don’t worry. You are among maniacs."

Kirk remained speechless when he noticed that more existences had started to amass on the edges of the hole. Some even took their place in the air since the ground became full. Everyone couldn’t wait for the battle to begin.

"Are you all crazy?!" Kirk eventually shouted as his respectful face vanished. "I’m alone against ten experts at my same level!"

"Shut up and fight!"

"Stop complaining!"

"You are lucky they aren’t dragons!"

A series of shouts resounded from the stages, with the latter belonging to Divine Demon. Noah limited himself to laugh and drink his wine while he brought June closer to his c.h.e.s.t.

"Go get them, my heir!" Noah shouted while June found a comfortable position on his c.h.e.s.t.

"Does it feel good?" Divine Demon asked.

"It’s not bad," Noah laughed. "I hope he can match my expectations."

"You are the best talent in the entire world," June snorted. "How can he even match you?"

King Elbas cleared his throat, but he didn’t add anything when he noticed the Foolery looking at him. The pig was waiting for his line, and he wouldn’t satisfy him.

"Did he go silent due to the pig?" Jordan asked as astonishment seeped into her voice.

"We found the perfect counter," Wilfred laughed.

"What has even happened to you on the other side?" Flying Demon asked as a tinge of regret appeared on his face.

"We definitely missed a good spectacle," Faith sighed when she saw how tight the relationship among the various experts had become.

"Enough!" Noah roared. "Fight!"

"You damned leaders!" Kirk complained as a few marks appeared on his back. "No one will laugh once I absorb the world and force you all to eat my shi-."

Kirk wanted to finish his line, but a hybrid with the shape of a three-headed wolf suddenly appeared at his side and tried to bite him.

Kirk snorted. He raised his face toward the sky, and a new mark appeared on his throat. A shrill cry eventually came out of his mouth, and the soundwaves generated by his voice forced all his opponents to interrupt their offensive.

The three-headed wolf had to pull back its maws to endure the soundwaves, but Kirk didn’t let it go. His leg shot toward the creature’s c.h.e.s.t and flung it into the wall.

The attack made the creature faint. A single physical blow delivered by a cultivator had defeated a hybrid at the same level.
