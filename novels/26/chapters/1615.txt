Chapter 1616 - 1616. Promising

Every move of the two rank 9 existences transformed the world in ways that the weaker existences couldn’t understand.

Great Builder gave birth to life. His influence transformed everything it touched into living beings that served him.

On the other hand, Radiant Eyes tainted the matter of the world and transformed it into something that reflected her deepest desire. Even the creatures born from Great Builder’s law couldn’t fend off her influence.

Their battle resembled a contest between domains. The two experts launched their auras and waited to see which one would take control of the world. Still, they never stopped spreading their influence, so the matter went through endless transformations.

Radiant Eyes didn’t want to continue fighting like that. Great Builder had the advantage with that battle style since he used his law and pyramid. Instead, Radiant Eyes was only relying on her giant.

The giant suddenly stopped moving before its figure started to transform. The creature crouched, and its limbs fused with its torso to create a tall mountain that spread Radiant Eyes’ aura.

The aura intensified until the sky turned red. Even Great Builder’s radiance didn’t manage to fight that light. Radiant Eyes was about to become serious, but her opponent didn’t show any fear.

The red halo slowly condensed toward the peak of the mountain. Its radiance continued to intensify, and it soon solidified into a monstrous shape.

Radiant Eyes appeared on top of the mountain. Her monstrous figure didn’t change much. Her insect legs, wings, and antennae had grown, but she looked like Noah recalled.

However, her aura was far more intense than before. Noah still recalled their first meeting, and he felt sure that his instincts didn’t sense the same amount of danger back then.

’The transformation is working,’ Noah sighed in his mind.

Noah didn’t lie to Radiant Eyes during their previous meeting. He couldn’t trick a rank 9 existence, so he had to advise her properly.

Radiant Eyes had then spent many years inside the human domain, and she had also perfected her transformation. She was already a self-made hybrid, but she would become even stronger if the procedure ended.

’I wonder how strong she would become at that point,’ Noah thought, but he quickly suppressed his curiosity.

His expertise in the magical beasts’ field made him desire to study Radiant Eyes after her transformation, but his current level didn’t give him much freedom. The expert had to die now, or he wouldn’t live to see another day.

"Why are you even interested in saving these weaklings?" Radiant Eyes asked while turning her monstrous face toward Great Builder. "They have served their purpose already. No point in keeping them alive."

"You fail to see the real enemy," Great Builder laughed while waving his hand to morph the dark-yellow bricks into different weapons. "Experts stronger than you have died at the hands of Heaven and Earth. I’m only preserving existences who have a chance to reach this stage."

"You lost the battle against the world," Radiant Eyes snorted. "I survived it. Your methods aren’t reliable."

"I bet you hid in that inscribed item because you were too scared of Heaven and Earth," Great Builder laughed.

"I hid to acc.u.mulate power," Radiant Eyes replied while spreading her arms and the legs that didn’t touch the scarlet ground. "Every living being uses the same approach. You can’t blame me for doing what was necessary."

"You might not be a coward," Great Builder explained, "But you did nothing to defeat Heaven and Earth. You only want to improve and hope to avoid those enemies for the rest of your life."

"I guess words are useless at this point," Radiant Eyes sighed.

"They have always been useless," Great Builder laughed. "Come on. Show me the core of your world."

"With pleasure," Radiant Eyes said while wearing a hideous smile.

Her aura spread through the mountain, and a swarm of bees gathered around her. Her influence continued to fly through the army, and those creatures slowly transformed.

The weaker bees directly died, and their bodies fused with the stronger specimens. Additional abdomens, legs, pincers, and eyes grew on those creatures as their power increased.

Their skin also transformed. The bees’ fur thickened as scarlet layers covered their exoskeleton and improved their overall structure.

"My law might be common," Radiant Eyes explained, "But I deploy it in ways that other existences can’t replicate. Come, join my world. I can grant you perfection."

Great Builder arched his eyebrow before waving both his hands. The various dark-yellow bricks spread through the nearby regions and fused with the matter.

The bricks fused with the ground, air, and living beings that were still in the area. They became cores for different workshops that began to absorb the energy in the world to give birth to peculiar creatures.

A series of armored humanoid figures grew from the workshops and carried different features, depending on the materials used during their creation. Some of them were white, while others were azure. Of course, their abilities also changed.

Bigger creatures came out of the workshops after that army. A series of dragons similar to Duanlong appeared in the world and opened their mouth to affect the bees.

Magical plants also grew from the ground and began to radiate a scent that seemed to distract the bees. Great Builder had given birth to creatures meant only to defeat Radiant Eyes.

"It will be a battle of worlds then," Radiant Eyes announced. "You can give life, but I can force evolutions. It’s time to see who is on the right path."

Radiant Eyes raised her hand, and the bees shot forward. Her aura continued to cover them and trigger evolutions, so the swarm had a completely different appearance when it reached Great Builder.

Great Builder glanced at the bees for a second before telling his creations to fight the enemy army. Yet, he didn’t let his guard down since a dangerous sensation had suddenly appeared in his mind.

A series of wh.i.p.s made of pure white light came out of his figure and cracked at a shadow that had tried to move behind him. The attack made him understand the actual identity of that threat, but he didn’t feel surprised at that sight.

The wh.i.p.s entangled themselves around Radiant Eyes’ monstrous body. Her figure was still above her mountain, but she had decided to trick Great Builder and rely on her hybrid body to surprise him.

The sudden attack didn’t turn out as she expected. Great Builder had predicted that Radiant Eyes would rely on her physical strength. After all, every hybrid did that.

The wh.i.p.s burnt Radiant Eyes’ skin and kept her stuck in her position. Yet, she had many legs and immense physical strength. She was even in the ninth rank. There was virtually nothing stronger in the entire world.

Radiant Eyes gave voice to a buzzing noise that forced Great Builder to retreat. The many puppets that had come to finish her also shattered in front of that deafening cry.

The rest of the army fought against the swarm of bees. They had to remain there since Great Builder had to understand how to handle that situation.

Great Builder found a dangerous solution, but he preferred to avoid it since he had been away for so long. Still, he couldn’t think of anything else.

Radiant Eyes’ army was slightly weaker, but she had her physical strength. She had turned the tables with the last assault. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

"You are really forcing me to do this," Great Builder sighed before taking out an oval item.

The aura of a rank 9 item spread through the sky and made Radiant Eyes hesitate, but her expression completely froze when she saw Great Builder absorbing the fake core.

Great Builder’s aura suddenly skyrocketed after the absorption, and his size grew until he became a nine hundred meters tall giant.
