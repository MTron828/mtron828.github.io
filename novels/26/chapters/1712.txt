Chapter 1715 - 1715. Wall

’That’s the firepower that we needed!’ Noah shouted in his mind.

Sword Saint was a monster. His power had evolved after reaching the solid stage. He wasn’t only launching slashes anymore. He had become sharpness itself.

The cultivators on the edges of the army stopped dying after Sword Saint joined the fray. The light and the cracking figures didn’t manage to near the group with three monsters handling the offensive.

Noah’s slashes were Heaven and Earth’s worst enemy. They inherently carried laws that opposed the rulers, and they featured intense destructive capabilities.

The violent thoughts amassed in his mind even boosted the destruction carried by his offensive. His singularities instinctively knew where to discharge their power to obtain the best effects. The light and the crackling figures could only crumble against his relentless attacks.

Robert seemed to have gone crazy. He never stopped laughing as giant purple masses condensed above his figure and flew toward the light. His law also carried innate effectiveness against Heaven and Earth’s laws, so his destructive potential was immense.

Sword Saint didn’t have any boost against Heaven and Earth’s law. Noah’s ambition didn’t even manage to affect his attacks. It seemed that the expert purposely refused anything that could affect the purity of his existence.

However, his attacks didn’t fall behind his companion’s offensive. Instead, they almost surpassed it in terms of destructive power. Sword Saint’s slashes were precise but massive. They could sever everything on their path, even when it came to Heaven and Earth’s light.

Noah used the areas cleared by his companions to heal his body. He deployed the Shadow Domain to teleport unstable masses of fiery dark matter in those zones and seize as much energy as possible.

The other experts in the army limited themselves to handle all the light and crackling figures that managed to escape from the trio’s offensive. They also protected the backlines and made sure that the whiteness never caught up with the group.

Divine Demon was alone in the lead. He had transformed into a dark-blue comet that Heaven and Earth couldn’t stop. His new higher energy had become something similar to the chaotic laws. It was born to destroy the light.

Noah felt surprised when he noticed that he could slightly relax. The battle didn’t seem too impossible anymore. Sword Saint’s arrival had eased the pressure on the army and given them a chance to overcome that trap.

’Will they give up so easily?’ Noah wondered while alternating singularities and fiery dark matter. ’They must have depleted a lot of energy to send us here. There has to be something else here.’

Noah could understand that Heaven and Earth didn’t expect Sword Saint’s arrival, but the army had a chance to overcome the trap even without him. The feat would have been far harsher but not impossible.

Noah expected Heaven and Earth to place an impossible challenge in front of him after so much preparation. Extremely hard wasn’t enough for him and the experts tainted by his influence.

The answer to his doubts dawned in his mind in an instant. His trust toward Heaven and Earth’s power gave him the chance to predict what was about to unfold.

"Group around Divine Demon!" Noah roared. "Heaven and Earth will try to take him out soon!" Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Everyone shot confused glances toward Noah. They couldn’t understand from where he had gotten that impression, but they didn’t dare to ignore his orders anyway.

Noah was the first to accelerate to catch up with Divine Demon. Robert and Sword Saint quickly followed, but the three of them never stopped launching attacks on their way.

Wilfred and the others were right behind them. They didn’t want to approach Divine Demon in his current state, but they couldn’t allow Heaven and Earth to kill him either. The expert was their only chance of getting out of there.

The rest of the army followed while the Foolery remained in the backlines. The creature had continued to release excrements throughout the entire battle. Its blue bushes were quite hard to destroy, so the pig had quickly understood that being the last in the army could bring many benefits.

The experts had to dodge the unstable dark-blue trail left by Divine Demon, but they quickly reached him anyway. The cultivator didn’t interact with them at all. He barely noticed their presence, but his friends expected a similar reaction.

Noah felt glad that Divine Demon’s energy didn’t automatically attack them, but his mood didn’t improve. Instead, anxiety started to build in his mind as he waited for Heaven and Earth to make their move.

Heaven and Earth didn’t make Noah wait too long. Divine Demon continued to clear light until he reached a tall crackling wall. A thick array of lightning bolts made that structure almost impenetrable, but its overall power was in the upper tier.

’There are thousands of lightning bolts in there,’ Noah thought while inspecting the wall. ’We will need at least a few series of attacks to pierce them.’

Noah’s group had temporarily stopped in front of the crackling wall, but Divine Demon had long since lost his mind. The expert continued to shoot forward, and the energy around him eventually clashed with the lightning bolts.

The impact with the wall generated an explosion that flung Divine Demon back and spread countless sparks in the environment. The whiteness seemed to take life when that energy seeped into its fabric, and many giant crackling figures soon came out of its halo.

The new crackling figures were bigger, and their power touched the peak of the upper tier. They were also faster, and their hands quickly rose toward the army to release a wave of lightning bolts that converged toward the experts.

Everyone released their best attacks, but they soon discovered that their power wasn’t enough to stop the entirety of that offensive. Noah, Robert, and Sword Saint could take care of most of the offensive on their own, but the rest of the army appeared useless in that situation.

The weaker experts weren’t to blame for that. Most of them were mere gaseous stage cultivators who couldn’t do anything against upper tier threats. They were at the bottom of the army in terms of power because all the other rank 7 beings had died, but it wasn’t their role to handle such powerful leftovers.

Those weaker cultivators ended up paying the price for the lack of power of their leaders. The lightning bolts fell on the army, and they ended up being the ones unable to defend themselves from that threat.

Noah saw the lightning bolts sweeping away half of his army. The stronger cultivators had survived, but that sight reminded him how out of place those experts were.

Heaven and Earth’s light devoured the laws that dispersed in the environment. Noah studied that event again, but a sense of disgust filled his mind. There was something off with that behavior, but he couldn’t understand what his instincts were sensing.

"Let’s pierce it," Noah shouted while turning toward Sword Saint. "Can we open a path with a clean slash?"

"One? Impossible," Sword Saint replied. "We would both need to be at the peak of the eighth rank for that."

"That won’t be necessary," King Elbas suddenly joined the conversation. "They are Heaven and Earth’s lightning bolts. I’ve studied them for countless years."

King Elbas drew a small flask from his space-ring. The crackling noises released by the wall intensified when the aura of the liquid contained inside the item reached the lightning bolts. Heaven and Earth seemed scared about the substance inside the item.

"This will weaken the lightning bolts and destroy a few of them," King Elbas explained while throwing the flask toward Noah. "There’s enough for one use. Don’t waste it."
