Chapter 1868 - 1868. Deal

Noah didn’t feel offended by old Heaven and Earth’s words. The similarities that they mentioned referred to his creation and destruction that the rulers shared.

The statement concerning the ghosts actually interested him. Noah didn’t know if his d.e.s.i.r.e to prove Heaven and Earth wrong was preventing him from thinking straight, but he couldn’t help himself nonetheless.

The group turned toward Robert. For some reason, the orange figure had marked him as the ghosts’ counter, and they tried to guess why. Luckily for them, the old rulers explained themselves before they wasted too long.

"His hatred toward us will improve his effectiveness against the ghosts," The orange figure explained.

"What about my hatred?" Steven snorted to express clear annoyance.

"Your feeling is a childish d.e.s.i.r.e for revenge," The figure replied. "It can’t compare to an existence reborn to hurt us."

"How much do you even know?" Noah asked as he arched his eyebrows.

Robert’s rebirth had happened on the other side of the Immortal Lands after a cocoon of mutated laws had surrounded his figure. Noah believed that the current Heaven and Earth had learnt about his abilities only after he expressed his power, but that didn’t involve the old rulers at all. Noah couldn’t even understand when they had the chance to study Robert’s life.

"The "Breath" can speak," The orange figure explained, "Even if it changes form. We can sense your feelings and existence resonating deep inside our core whenever you speak, move, or breathe."

King Elbas almost regretted mentioning his ideas about old Heaven and Earth’s situation after learning that. The orange figure had stated that its power was only a shadow of its actual existence, but that was enough to surprise a group of experts who could defy common logic. He couldn’t even imagine how strong it could be at its peak.

"Can they really win like this?" Noah asked as doubts formed in his mind. "Isn’t there a limit to this cycle of counters?"

"It depends on how many of them remain alive," The orange figure answered. "Also, yes, Heaven and Earth aren’t trying to solve the issue with this method. They are just stalling to have enough time to defeat the dragons."

The images in front of the orange figure never stopped moving and depicting what it said. They didn’t represent the ghosts, but they added visuals to the explanation.

"Do the stormy regions have other existence worth keeping in mind?" Noah continued to ask.

It felt strange to be at that point in his cultivation journey. The mysteries of the world unfolded themselves in his vision with each answer he received or step he took. Noah almost couldn’t believe that his idea of Heaven and Earth’s system was almost complete. The only completely blank spot was the sky. Everything else was understandable, even if his power had yet to reach the ninth rank.

"Every rank 9 existence who opposes Heaven and Earth will eventually face a counter," The orange figure assured. "The stronger they are, the more unique the counters will be."

’Heaven and Earth have yet to make specific counters for us then,’ Noah confirmed when he thought about his companions.

The rulers had already built inscribed items that could counter his abilities. The same probably went for his companions and the other experts, but none of them had stepped on the ninth rank yet. Heaven and Earth were still holding back their power in their punishments.

Noah didn’t hide his curiosity toward his counter, but his thoughts soon returned on his current situation. His group could have access to many interesting structures and knowledge inside the city, but taking everything for granted was the same as accepting the army. He wanted to pay the price to give more value to his gains. Also, he d.e.s.i.r.ed to hurt Heaven and Earth’s plans as much as possible.

"We can’t say much about the sky," The orange figure continued its explanation. "It was only a barrier before. We had ideas about cities and homes, but we don’t know how far that project has gone. We suspect pretty far."

Noah and the others almost expected that answer. It felt only normal for the last destination in the plane to be so unreachable, even for Heaven and Earth’s previous core.

"Let’s make a deal," Noah eventually exclaimed. "We will take care of the ghosts in exchange for some structures in the city."

"We are already offering the city to you," The orange figure contradicted, and the experts couldn’t help but shake their heads to express their helplessness.

"You really had to repeat that," Noah sighed before showing a cold smile. "I have something else in my mind, luckily. You are too valuable to remain here. Start working on getting out."

"We are just a sha-," The orange figure started to repeat, but Noah promptly interrupted it.

"Shadow of your former something," Noah snorted. "I know. I don’t care. You created this mess. You don’t get to watch everything unfolding from the stages. I want you to become a core part of the last battle."

"But that’s impossible!" The orange figure complained.

"Make it possible," Noah replied. "Welcome to Heaven and Earth’s Cancer. I hope you have fun."

Noah stood up at that point. He had a plan, a complicated one even. It would require millennia of work and far more power than he wielded, but it seemed his best bet at stalling Heaven and Earth’s victory.

"Come on," Noah laughed. "We have ghosts to catch."

"Do we take souvenirs first?" King Elbas asked as he stood up.

"Of course!" Noah grinned. "I want this spectacular drink in huge quantity, a rank 9 Kesier rune, and multiple weaker Kesier runes for my experiments."

"What?" The orange figure asked in confusion, but the other experts soon stood up and imitated him.

"I’ll take everything you have to the origin of inscriptions," King Elbas announced. "Don’t forget the drinks either."

"I’ll have as many exotic materials you can gather," Robert continued.

"Food," Alexander whispered. "Good food."

"I’ll go for food too," Wilfred exclaimed. "I’ll see if the city can give something better once we return."

"I want the wine version of this drink," Divine Demon said.

"Give me your understanding of the sky," Steven snorted. "I’ll show you how my hatred can keep up with the horned one."

"Don’t take it on me now," Robert laughed.

"Can I cut the ghosts?" Sword Saint asked once the experts were done.

"You can," The orange figure slowly answered.

"Are they strong?" Sword Saint continued.

"Strong isn’t the exact word we’d use to describe them," The old Heaven and Earth explained. "They have unique powers meant to affect wills and us."

"We can actually kill all of them then!" Noah laughed again.

"I was sure you were sending us against another unbeatable opponent," King Elbas sighed. "What a surprise."

"Some of us has to reach the ninth rank sooner or later," Noah commented. "Do you plan on facing the breakthrough with no experience against beings in the ninth rank?"

"We have fought rank 9 creatures since we entered the stormy regions," King Elbas rebuked.

"I remember you taking care of rank 8 cultivators," Noah joked.

"Because you ordered so," King Elbas corrected. "It won’t happen again."

The orange figure inspected the bickering in confusion. The other experts soon joined Noah and King Elbas, but the old rulers continued to fail to understand the reason behind their actions. However, the inspection slowly gave birth to a feeling that it had experienced before. It almost felt the need to laugh when watching the experts.
