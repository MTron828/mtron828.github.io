The construction of Noah’s underground facility didn’t take much, the workers were cultivators in the second and third rank after all, digging and soundproofing the structure was easy for beings of such power.

The structure had four separate areas, one for the slaves, one for the magical beasts, a reinforced one for the experiments, and one where Noah could rest or cultivate.

Noah entered the structure followed by the slaves that he had recently purchased and ordered to everyone else to leave, there had to be no witnesses to his experiments.

"I’ve gathered the "Breath" that you asked for, Prince. The cultivators in the liquid stage of the third rank here are only of the fire, water, and wind element but there should be a larger variety once the link between your mansion and the archipelago is completed."

Kate spoke as she handed a space-ring to Noah, she bowed before leaving him alone in the just built facility.

Noah inspected the contents of the ring, he could see that its insides were filled shining crystals similar to the Obsidian Credits but that had three different colors.

’I have all the ingredients now, I can finally start.’

Noah thought as he wore the ring and led the slaves toward the deepest part of the underground structure.

The cries of the magical beasts chained in another area filled the structure but Noah completely ignored them, his mind reviewed the idea behind his body-nourishing method one last time before he started to work on its creation.

The humans of that world had a mortal enemy, or, to say it better, a constant threat, namely the magical beasts.

Those creatures were powerful beings that seemed able to form packs in no time and that were always driven by their endless hunger, cultivators had to constantly clear the areas around their cities and domains to prevent the commoners and the weaker cultivators from being attacked.

What was worse was that magical beasts had a clear path toward power, they didn’t have any requirement for element or source to increase their level, they could just absorb "Breath" from anything containing it and make it theirs.

The reason for that was unknown.

Cultivators had studied magical beasts since they first came in contact with them, they tried to learn how they could grow stronger without any limitation for their element, they researched how they could just eat anything that contained "Breath" to raise their level.

Yet, no one could ever recreate that quality.

Many techniques, methods, and drugs were inspired by the training method of the magical beasts but they were only imitations that couldn’t match the original, no one till this day had ever been successful in that feat.

Noah wasn’t an exception.

He could be considered an expert when it came to magical beasts, his interest in those creatures had been born when the dragon attacked his mansion when he was just a child and it had never faded.

However, even with the teaching of the academy and after absorbing the Bloodline inheritance, he was clueless about the peculiar training process of those creatures.

He knew what magical beasts felt, the Bloodline inheritance made him experience the lives of the Excavating worms and even left him part of their instincts but he was still unable to find the answer to the question that had afflicted cultivators through all their history.

Yet, he didn’t need to understand how magical beasts worked to create his nourishing method.

"Whoever survives will be set free and provided with cultivation resources, just do your best."

Noah lied as he spoke to the slaves chained on the area that was reserved for them, he wanted to be sure that they would do anything in their power to keep themselves alive but he had yet to decide on the fate of the survivors.

His experiments would be affected if the slaves decided to give up on life due to the pain that they were going to suffer, Noah gave them hope to make sure that they would try their best to endure the procedure before starting.

A sheet appeared in his hands, it described the aptitude of the slaves as well as the level of their centers of power and training, everything had been listed in an orderly way by the slave trader.

’I should start with someone of the fire aptitude, I have more "Breath" and magical beasts of that element after all.’

Noah decided and randomly picked a slave of the fire element from the ones that he had purchased.

He was a man wearing ragged clothes and with a body filled with scars, it was clear that he had suffered a lot before becoming a slave and being sold to Noah.

Noah led him to the central room of the underground structure where he tied him to the wall. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Then, he picked one of the red crystals from the ring that Kate gave him, the liquid "Breath" contained inside it was of the fire element and came from one of the rank 3 cultivators of his group.

Noah neared the crystal to his head, his half-transparent figure inside his sea of consciousness reached for the walls of the sphere and stretched its ethereal hands to the outside world to create a connection where the liquid "Breath" could pass.

Little by little, the "Breath" of the fire element entered Noah’s mental sphere through his half-transparent figure and was attacked by his mental sphere.

Noah was a rank 4 mage, removing the will of Heaven and Earth from that "Breath" was an easy task, he was simply too strong for it.

In a matter of minutes, Noah successfully stored "Breath" of a different element inside his mental sphere!

In that way, he could potentially forge items for cultivators of another element but his intentions were different at that moment.

Refining it was even easier, Noah casually filled the "Breath" with a will that carried his ambition, the red "Breath" became a formless lake that seemed ready to explode after that.

’This definitely isn’t the right meaning with which fill the "Breath" but I’ll fix this issue later on.’

Noah thought as he stood up and went to pick a magical beast of the fire element from the area nearby.

The creature was a Fire wolf in the third rank, the cage containing it was an inscribed item that the elder had specifically requested from the archipelago, the lines on its surface were created after Divine Demon’s copying technique.

Noah’s powerful consciousness focused on the mind of the beast, the wolf felt as if an earthquake was happening inside its mind before its eyes lost any trace of life, it took only a thought for Noah to kill the beast!

Noah carried the corpse of the beast back where the slave was chained and laid it right next to the man.

"Endure now."

He spoke one last time before he put one hand on both the man and the corpse.

Then, he controlled the red "Breath" inside his mind to fill the corpse, the corpse of the beast seemed to liquefy as it entered the man’s body.
