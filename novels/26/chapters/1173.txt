Chapter 1175 1175. Fires

King Elbas had studied the Night-blade Pterodactyls, but he couldn’t predict Night’s power.

The creature was a former divine magical beast that had kept many of its instincts after it escaped its prison. Moreover, its new body enhanced its innate abilities, and the Royal Metal inside it made Night even more threatening.

Noah’s ambition affected Night’s prowess too. The Pterodactyl felt its entire being brimming with power as Noah’s law covered it.

Even if the effect of Noah’s law lasted only an instant, Night felt as if it had become one step closer to its previous level.

One instant was all the Pterodactyl needed. It transformed as soon as it came out of the trail of dark matter created by Noah’s slash, and it dived right through King Elbas’ defenses.

The Royal immediately sensed the threat, and a second wave of flames came out of his figure. Yet, when he studied his body, King Elbas noticed that a small cut had appeared on his cheek.

"This one is tough," Night conveyed through its mental connection with Noah.

Its shadow had come out of King Elbas’ body as soon as it sensed the new flames coming, and it had returned inside the dark world by cutting through the fiery sea around his figure.

Part of its body had suffered some damage, but the dark world quickly poured dark matter inside it. Night wouldn’t return to its peak immediately, but its recovery wouldn’t take long.

Night sensed Noah’s intentions and returned by his side. The surprise attack had failed, so the leaders could only rely on their previous strategy now.

"Let’s retreat!" Noah conveyed through the inscribed notebooks that the leaders had prepared before the battle.

God’s Left Hand and Great Elder Diana didn’t like how Noah’s words resembled an order, and they were still pissed that he didn’t warn them about the surprise attack beforehand.

However, they didn’t say anything and flew toward the surface where a large formation opened a path for the secret dimension.

King Elbas barely had any time to react. Not even ten seconds had passed between Night’s attack and the leaders’ retreat. They retreated in the separate dimension without giving their opponent any opportunity.

The entire southeastern coast lit up as countless doors connected to the separate dimension activated. Multiple platoons made of cultivators and hybrids appeared on the surface and launched attacks toward King Elbas before the inscriptions teleported them away.

King Elbas waved his hand, and his flames burned every attack flying at him. Thousands of spells had converged toward him, but even their joint power wasn’t enough to make him flinch.

It couldn’t be helped. The platoons only had rank 4 and 5 assets. Even if they could launch an offensive capable of making entire regions crumble, they couldn’t do anything against King Elbas.

"You have united a world against me," King Elbas said as he watched the formations shining again. "You have my most sincere gratitude."

The platoons came out of the teleportation matrices and launched another wave of spells before disappearing from the surface.

They couldn’t touch King Elbas even with their second offensive, but their task was a success every time the Royal made use of his golden flames.

Noah, God’s Left Hand, and Great Elder Diana knew that beating King Elbas in a frontal clash was impossible. Yet, the Royal had to burn himself to create his golden flames, so they could hope of tiring him out.

"You made the world the last stepping stone before my ascension," King Elbas announced as he spread his arms. "I can’t ask for a better last enemy in the Mortal Lands."

Everyone inside the separate dimension could hear his words. The organizations had deployed many sensors through the sky and ground before the battle to keep track of King Elbas’ condition.

His words made God’s Left Hand and Great Elder Diana’s expressions turn ugly, but they didn’t lose their battle intent. On the other hand, Noah continued to show his cold smile as he watched the images of the fight happening in the outside world.

Noah didn’t care about King Elbas’ arrogance. He didn’t mind if the Royal ascended before him as long as he left the world.

Still, Noah wasn’t willing to suffer a massive defeat in the hope that the event could push King Elbas into the divine ranks. He would use every trap that he had prepared.

King Elbas continued to unleash golden flames to stop the rhythmical offensive of the weaker assets. The platoons would appear from different formations, launch their spells, and disappear right after. There wasn’t a proper strategy to stop that type of offensive.

Yet, they couldn’t do anything against King Elbas. They were nothing more than flies for King Elbas’ defense.

"Keep attacking," Noah conveyed through the inscribed notebook connected with the army. "Keep the sky golden."

The Matriarchs couldn’t hold back their voice anymore when they saw him ordering the troops around without even consulting them. God’s Left Hand didn’t have any friendly relationship with the Hive, so she was the first to give voice to complaints.

"Who put you in charge?" God’s Left Hand said. "You aren’t the leader of this army. Stop behaving like that."

"Have I ever given an order that you didn’t agree with?" Noah asked without moving his eyes away from the screens that depicted King Elbas.

"You attacked without consulting us," Great Elder Diana stepped in that discussion to express her opinion.

"That wasn’t an order," Noah replied. "Also, I’ve left a mark on his face. That should slow down his improvements for a while."

Every powerhouse in the world knew that King Elbas’ individuality grew together with his achievements. The fact that a liquid stage expert had wounded him was a blow to his arrogance.

Of course, Noah’s actions would be useless if the world didn’t manage to defend against the attack. Nothing would be able to stop King Elbas anymore at that point.

King Elbas began to descend while arrays of spells continued to converge in his position. That offensive didn’t slow him down, and the Royal had all the time to prepare his counterattack.

Flames condensed in his palms to take the shape of long spears. King Elbas let them fall toward the ground as he descended, and long trails of golden flames followed them.

"Full retreat!" Noah shouted through the inscribed notebook, and all the platoons returned inside the separate dimension to avoid the incoming attack.

In their place, an army of magical beasts appeared on the surface and took care of their task.

The organizations didn’t dare to slow down their offensive for even an instant. King Elbas had to be under constant pressure, and he couldn’t take breaks to fix the injuries caused by his higher energy.

The main goal of the defenders was to exhaust him. Giving him some time to recover would only make that threat unbeatable.

"You did it again!" God’s Left Hand complained.

"I’m faster," Noah replied without showing any slyness in his expression. "And I’m the leader of the strongest organization in these Mortal Lands. Most defenses come from the Hive, so I don’t see anyone more suitable to be the shot caller in this room."

The trio was in an isolated part of the separate dimension. Almost everyone had access to screens that played the images in the sky, but only the leaders had so many inscribed items around them.

Various objects meant to evaluate the current power of a cultivator and analyze their existence surrounded the leaders. That was a proper control room.

"Warn us if you are about to do something reckless again," Great Elder Diana said to put an end to that discussion.

She didn’t mind that Noah had decided to call the shots, but she didn’t like when he deviated from their main strategy. She could have helped during the surprise attack if she knew that Noah wanted to execute that strategy.

The spears landed on two different regions while the army of beasts created through the Copying Technique continued its assault. Massive fires unfolded on those territories as King Elbas’ attacks touched the ground.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m
