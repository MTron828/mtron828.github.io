Chapter 1797 - 1797. Complaints

Leaving the energy released by the jellyfish in the void would only allow it to disperse. Noah couldn’t contain all of it even when his ambition empowered the dark world, so he had to absorb it inside the black hole to ensure that he didn’t leave anything behind.

An immense pressure started to build inside Noah. He had been the first expert to reach the corpse, so he had managed to absorb the biggest share of energy. Yet, that power could fuel a rank 9 creature, and even his incredible centers of power fell a bit short.

The black hole struggled to contain that massive wave of energy. It couldn’t purify it in its current state, and its edges inevitably grew unstable. Those instabilities then spread toward the rest of Noah’s body and made his flesh shake.

Still, Noah didn’t stop. He knew how resilient his body was, and he couldn’t let that energy disperse either.

His ambition stopped fueling the dark world. The energy contained by the technique created flares that shot toward the void once their restrains weakened, but an intense pulling force stopped their flight before they could disperse in the infinite darkness.

Noah moved Isaac’s ability and his ambition on his black hole. The entirety of his reason-defying empowerment went on the fourth center of power and forced it to reach a superior state.

The waves of dark matter in its insides started to solidify while they left the organ’s edges and expanded outside Noah’s figure. The black hole went through the transformation that only a better fuel could cause, and it generated a dark singularity that grew and created a gravitational pull.

Noah’s friends had to retreat when they saw that raging dark matter trying to engulf them into its dense waves. Part of the energy they had seized even escaped their control and flew toward the massive black hole.

The problems didn’t end there. The gravitational pull grew smarter as the black hole started to require more fuel to evolve. A second pulling force fused with the first and began to affect the energy stored in the centers of power of the experts in the surroundings.

King Elbas and those who had managed to get past the storm of lightning bolts found themselves forced to leave the area. Their centers of power appeared unable to restrain their energy. Even their bodies started to wither under that influence.

Luckily for the group, those who had managed to fly past the storm of lightning bolts could also escape Noah’s threatening influence before he could inflict serious injuries. Everyone managed to leave the range of the massive black hole, but the relentless growth of the singularity forced them to retreat even more after a few minutes.

"Wait!" Elsie shouted while approaching the retreating group. "Will you let him take everything?"

"Why is she even talking with us?" The Foolery asked when all the experts turned toward her.

The experts didn’t know what to say. Their eyes went on the massive black hole before showing blank expressions toward Elsie. There was a singularity capable of absorbing the energy inside their centers of power between them and their gains. They didn’t know how the cultivator could even question their behavior.

"Shouldn’t we split everything together?" Keith asked.

"He missed the part when the slimy corpse started releasing lightning bolts," The Foolery commented.

The four cultivators from the human organizations turned their angry eyes toward the pig at that point. They knew that the situation had evolved during the hunt, but they didn’t expect to remain empty-handed. They didn’t think that being reckless in that group could provide more rewards.

The upper tier Eternal Snake lowered its head toward the four cultivators when it sensed their anger toward the Foolery. Its forked tongue trembled in the void before a low hiss came out of its mouth.

"You can’t hurt this one," The Eternal Snake hissed while human words came out of its mouth. "We need it for food."

Elsie and her three companions showed helpless expressions when they looked at the snake. They had tried to complain about their leader’s behavior, but they had only received insults and threats in return.

Those with a human appearance didn’t even bother to reply. They seemed properly confused about her complaints.

Only a few experts and magical beasts had managed to seize a consistent amount of energy. Noah had ended up taking everything else.

"You can’t complain once the situation escapes our control," Robert eventually explained. "We threw ourselves into the array of lightning bolts without showing the slightest hesitation. How can you even expect to get a share?"

"Organizations should consider all its underlings," Elsie tried to argue.

"That’s why they are dead," King Elbas scoffed. "We don’t need useless experts who gain benefits from the work of others. You should start fighting for what you want. Heaven and Earth will kill you otherwise."

"You have chosen to go against Heaven and Earth only recently," Wilfred added. "We have fought them for millennia already. We are all monsters here because we are the only ones who survived."

Being powerful cultivators wasn’t enough there. King Elbas and the others had accomplished enough feats to make their names immortal, but they were still there, fighting for resources.

The experts also challenged each other to do better, which explained their extraordinary power even further. They couldn’t let themselves fall behind. They wouldn’t be able to follow Noah in his crazy plans otherwise.

"Does it always end like this?" Elsie eventually asked while pointing at the expanding black hole.

"Todays has been easy actually," Wilfred announced before exploding into a loud laugh.

"The creature didn’t have any chance," King Elbas commented. "Even the idiots from the Crystal City would have survived this battle."

Another wave of astonishment reached the four cultivators. The battle against a rank 9 creature with unknown abilities and peculiar features was nothing for those experts. The group even seemed to agree with that statement.

"How long does it usually take?" Alexander asked while turning toward King Elbas.

"He is empowering the source of his darkness to endure the intense wave of energy," King Elbas explained. "It won’t stop until he manages to stabilize his centers of power and start a proper absorption."

"Can we move him?" Steven asked.

"You are free to try," King Elbas laughed.

"We can’t stay here," Elsie joined that topic while forsaking her previous arrogance. "You formation can keep the void at bay, but we have just fought and depleted a lot of energy. The hole isn’t anywhere near even. We should start to consider going back."

"it’s too early for that," King Elbas announced as his voice grew cold. "We still don’t have enough energy for the world. Our stashes of energy are dwindling, but we expected much. A few more decades inside the void should be enough to meet every requirement."
