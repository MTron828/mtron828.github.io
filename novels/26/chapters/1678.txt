Chapter 1679 - 1679. Curiosity

Noah transformed into a tall black Devil. His influence intensified and invaded other domains, and it even pierced the four solid stage cultivators’ auras.

King Elbas continued to deploy defenses and inscribed items to prepare for the imminent clash, but a shadow suddenly ran past him.

Noah had yet to stop absorbing the energy in the environment, but an immense force landed on his body and flung him on the ground.

A trail of chaotic laws left his body and created a black line that connected his previous spot with the hole dug during the crash. Yet, that energy dispersed after Wilfred punched the air multiple times.

"I didn’t need help," King Elbas snorted.

"I’m not helping you," Wilfred replied without moving his eyes from the hole in the ground. "Do you know what happened to him?"

"This is only one of his crazy experiments," King Elbas explained while nearing the hybrid. "I suspect that the chaotic laws around him work as a chrysalis. He is clearly transforming, but I don’t know if he’ll have enough time."

"What do we do then?" Divine Demon asked while joining the group.

"Suppressing him is impossible," King Elbas continued. "We have to beat him up once he regains control of his senses."

"I like the plan," Wilfred laughed while cracking his fingers.

"I’ll also help," Divine Demon added.

"It’s better if you remain behind," King Elbas said while stopping Divine Demon. "Your law doesn’t suit this battle. You’ll end up fighting Noah to the death."

Divine Demon wanted to complain, but King Elbas’ speech made sense. A snort came out of his mouth before he rejoined the other members of his team and helped them in their battles.

The ground around the hole turned black as Noah’s ambition seeped through his fabric. The terrain of the entire region quickly transformed into a tough alloy that seemed able to reject attacks containing "Breath".

A crazy laugh soon came out of the hole and spread through the sky. Noah’s figure stepped outside the hole and eyed the two experts in the sky. His smirk had broadened, and a pair of cavities had appeared where his eyes should be.

King Elbas pointed his spear toward Noah and released a piercing beam made of golden light. The attack reached its target in an instant, but a black sea spread on the ground before it could touch Noah.

A violent version of the dark world expanded and covered the ground. It spread until the region’s borders and began to rise toward the sky as Noah flew toward his opponents.

Wilfred raised his arms and joined his hands before throwing a massive blow toward the black sea. A hole appeared in its structure and pierced it from side to side, but the attack didn’t stop the technique.

Still, Wilfred and King Elbas could see what had happened to the black ground through the hole. The black metal that had appeared before had completely disappeared. It seemed that the dark world had devoured it.

A tinge of fear reached the experts’ minds. The dark world was too dangerous. They couldn’t let it engulf them.

"Do you have anything against that thing?" Wilfred asked.

"Why do I always end up wasting my stash of inscribed items for you?" King Elbas sighed before opening his free hand and pointing his palm toward the incoming black sea.

Countless inscribed items fell toward the dark world and entered its liquid structure. King Elbas was using his entire stash to defeat that technique, but he still preserved his best creations.

Thousands of inscribed items entered the dark world and detonated before King Elbas lost connection with them. The violent dark matter seemed able to endure that offensive, but golden flares eventually pierced its structure.

Cracks eventually appeared on the technique. Golden light shone from them and filled the environment before generating a massive explosion that forced the other experts to deploy defensive measures.

Lumps of violent dark matter flew in every direction and destroyed everything they touched. Some sharks died when that substance hit them, and the same went for a few weak cultivators.

Noah reappeared in the middle of the sky. His armor of chaotic laws had partly disappeared, but his face continued to point at his opponents. Yet, Wilfred suddenly appeared above him and released a storm of punches that flung him back on the ground.

Wilfred didn’t stop there. He followed Noah into the hole created on the ground and continued to release attacks.

Massive cracks spread through the region. The entire area was about to fall apart due to Wilfred’s relentless offensive.

The hybrid couldn’t stop throwing punches. His hesitation would give a chance to the chaotic laws to acc.u.mulate on his figure, and he couldn’t let them touch him. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Moreover, he was suppressing Noah, which was the whole point of the battle. He only had to continue until Noah regained control over his consciousness.

However, a wall suddenly brought his attacks to an end. Wilfred’s eyes widened when he saw that fiendish claws had grasped his wrists and were managing to keep his arms still.

Wilfred tried to break free, but Noah’s physical strength stopped his attempts. The hybrid could finally confirm that Noah was stronger than him.

The chaotic laws around Noah had disappeared, but his laugh soon spread through the sky again and attracted other Devils. Those creatures shot toward him and fused with his figure while he continued to keep Wilfred locked in his grasp.

Wilfred kicked Noah, but his attack didn’t do anything. Noah was a wall that he couldn’t break.

King Elbas arrived in his aid. He landed next to the two experts and pointed his spear at Noah. The tip of his weapon touched Noah’s head before a dense beam shot out of it.

Wilfred couldn’t break free even after that attack. The golden light dispersed and revealed Noah’s real face. A deep cut had appeared on his cheek, but that injury didn’t remove his crazy smile.

Noah’s face didn’t change, but his expression was far from normal. A dark-red light came out of his eyes, and pure ecstasy filled his features. He appeared truly happy to be in that situation.

Darkness acc.u.mulated in Noah’s mouth before a wave of black flames filled the environment. Dark matter also expanded and engulfed the two experts.

King Elbas and Wilfred found themselves inside Noah’s techniques. The currents of darkness ran through their figures and damaged their techniques. They applied mutations and weakened their existence at the same time.

The dark matter also devoured the chunks of energy that the techniques lost due to the mutations. King Elbas and Wilfred were opposing the transformations at that time, so Noah’s ambition was hurting them.

King Elbas quickly closed his eyes, and his curiosity spread through the waves of darkness around him. His aura filled the entirety of Noah’s technique and studied it in its entirety.

The expert had found a countermeasure to Noah’s ambition long ago. Noah’s existence was evolving, but King Elbas could still differentiate his law from the mutations.

King Elbas’ curiosity focused on his former ambition before snapping his fingers. The waves of darkness suddenly lost power and gained red shades. The expert had removed Noah’s ambition from the technique, which left only the power of the Devils around them.

The attack also weakened Noah and allowed Wilfred to break free from his grasp. The hybrid shouted before slamming his fists on the ground and generating a massive shockwave that shattered the technique around him.

The two experts finally broke free of the dark currents, but a tinge of surprise appeared in their eyes when they turned toward Noah. The latter had crouched on the ground, and his body had begun to show traces of instability.
