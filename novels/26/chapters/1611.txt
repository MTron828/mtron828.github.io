Chapter 1613 - 1613. Talent

"How can you make people angry so easily?" Alexander asked without bothering to use his mental waves.

"He got his individuality all wrong," Jordan sighed. "His ambition is incredible, but he could have been far stronger in that field."

"He might have gotten that from his Master," King Elbas added.

"I won’t deny it," Divine Demon said before the leaders landed on the ground in front of the army.

The bees had changed during the past years. They had become bigger, and an additional pair of legs had grown from their torso. They also had long pinchers now, and their bodies seemed sturdier than before.

Some of the bees had even gained an additional abdomen. Those improved specimens resembled an elite force capable of commanding entire platoons. They even had a unique aura flowing out of their bodies.

A platoon made of hundreds of bees shot forward as soon as the enemy leaders landed on the ground. That group contained many rank 8 specimens, but Noah’s army didn’t falter.

A series of golden lines lit up when the bees were about to approach the army. The light gathered in the sky and gave birth to a group of golems and puppets. They immediately flew toward the swarm and began to slaughter its specimens.

Countless bees died during the first clash, but no one cheered in front of that small victory. That platoon was only a tiny part of the enemy army, and the leaders didn’t even know how many specimens were still inside the giant.

The puppets detonated when the bees were about to destroy them. Flares made of golden flames shot through the sky and killed every magical beast in their range. The first platoon died in a little less than a minute.

"I’m playing your game," Radiant Eyes’ voice resounded from the giant, "But I make the rules."

The giant raised its hand before an intense buzzing noise came out of its scarlet fabric. All the magical beasts and hybrids in the area managed to understand the meaning carried by that cry. Radiant Eyes had given the order for a relentless assault.

The entire army of bees shot forward. Noah and the others saw hundreds of specimens in the eighth rank flying toward them to launch a selfless assault. None of those creatures cared about their life.

Noah and the others didn’t need to exchange any word. They had already prepared a battle tactic. They limited themselves to roar toward the incoming army and prepare for the imminent clash.

Even more golden lights lit up around the army and gave birth to an army of fiery puppets. Those defenses leapt among the bees and began to kill as many specimens as they could.

The bees directly ignored those puppets. They didn’t care about those defenses. Their targets were on the ground, and they would stop at nothing to take them down. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The rank 7 cultivators, hybrids, and magical beasts performed battle formations until they transformed into five nine-headed hydras in the eighth rank. They were only in the lower tier, but they could join the fight properly in that form.

Noah, Wilfred, Alexander, Jordan, Ian, and Divine Demon stepped forward and waited for their opponents to arrive. They all picked a target among the incoming swarm and prepared to face them.

A middle tier bee dived toward Noah. The creature could sense that its opponent was at its same level, but Radiant Eyes’ orders made it unable to understand the actual difference in power.

Noah didn’t even bother to draw his sword. He raised his hand and waited for the stinger to land on his open palm.

A clanging noise echoed through the sky when the stinger hit his palm. Noah didn’t feel any pain, and he didn’t even take a step back. The attack couldn’t make him move nor bleed.

The bee didn’t care about that show of power and continued to press forward, but Noah promptly ripped off its stinger before stabbing his hand in the injury.

The creature tried to give voice to its pain, but Noah instantly waved his hand. A singularity shot out of his fingers after that gesture, and the bee ended up divided in half.

More middle tier magical beasts tried to dive toward him, but they met the same fate. Noah tore their bodies apart with his bare hands. He didn’t need anything else against creatures at that level.

Radiant Eyes had turned the bees into selfless creatures, but she didn’t make them stupid. They didn’t have the best intelligence compared to other magical beasts, but they could understand that middle tier specimens couldn’t handle Noah.

One of the specimens with an additional abdomen soon left its position and dived toward Noah. His instincts warned him about that new threat. They could sense that an upper tier creature was approaching his position at high speed.

The black hole quickly started to push the unstable substance inside the black vessels. Noah felt a surge of power flowing through his entire body, and he smiled when he sensed that his tissues could now endure that technique.

The breakthrough had reinforced the black vessels since Noah often relied on the unstable substance. His existence had moved toward those fields, so his body knew where it had to improve.

The massive bee crashed on Noah in an instant. A grey cloud soon filled that part of the battlefield and hid the result of the clash.

The other experts didn’t have time to worry about Noah. They had been clear when they prepared the plan. That battle had to leave only the strongest among them alive, so they couldn’t neglect their fights to help others. Of course, that implied Great Builder’s actual resurrection.

’I’m getting there,’ Noah thought as a red radiance shone from behind his eyes.

The bee’s legs had stabbed his body in multiple spots, but they had never managed to pierce past Noah’s muscles. On the other hand, Noah had stopped the stinger with his bare hands again, and he couldn’t help but feel elated at that sight.

The creature tried to break free, but Noah’s grip wouldn’t budge. The bee struggled and launched attacks, but a series of black figures appeared in its path.

Noah slammed the bee a few times on the ground before approaching its head. The creature was still trying to attack him, but he pressed his foot on its left eye and kept it in its position while he drew the Demonic Sword.

The blade flashed with a black light multiple times, and a head eventually rolled on the ground. Noah had only recently stepped into the middle tier, but he was already able to take down upper tier magical beasts.

Noah stored the corpse before jumping among the storm of bees that was engulfing his army. A series of roots spread from his figure, and countless creatures died due to their corrosive aura.

That stunt granted him special attention. Noah saw countless bees turning in his direction and interrupting the attack on his troops. A wave of winged creatures soon tried to engulf Noah, but only the middle tier specimens could survive around him at that point.

The Demonic Form had obtained a new source of food after his breakthrough in the middle tier. Noah had provided the parasite with superior primary, and the results were spectacular.
