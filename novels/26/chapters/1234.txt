Chapter 1235 1235. Range

The saber-shaped runes and the giant fiendish copies became less accurate after Noah entered his dimension. Controlling his spells from inside that dark environment was hard, and the Eternal Snake didn’t overlook that detail.

The beast was against multiple enemies, and cuts continued to appear inside his most profound injury, but it didn’t lose its cool for too long. Noah’s offensive had surprised it, but there was no fear in its eyes.

The creature knew how resilient it was. It didn’t like to suffer, but it wouldn’t hesitate to injure its body to escape from a difficult situation.

It was aware that its healing abilities were off the scale. Weaker beasts would usually ignore how strong their innate skills were, but that didn’t apply to the Eternal Snakes.

The beast couldn’t create ice in that situation. The five copies and the sea of blades took care of its silver liquid as soon as it escaped its mouth. Yet, there was something that they couldn’t suppress.

The Snake began to fall when the corrosive smoke destroyed even the ice that acted as its foothold. Noah’s spells chased the creature until it crashed on the ground. Their offensive never stopped, but the beast began to counterattack now that it could exploit its body’s flexibility again.

One of the giant fiendish copies exploded when the tail cracked on its figure. Violent gales made of corrosive smoke shot everywhere in the environment, and the energy contained by the fuming armor caused an explosion in the area.

The Snake roared in pain when that wave of energy hit its injuries. Its condition worsened, and the blades exploited that situation to inflict even more damage.

The beast didn’t even try to dodge those attacks. Its head remained still as it let Noah’s abilities ravage its skin and muscles until it became nothing more than a maimed mass of flesh. Only its skulls continued to give it a reptilian shape.

The Snake’s tail continued to crack while that offensive continued. Every attack destroyed part of Noah’s abilities, and it didn’t mind trading pieces of its skin to take care of them.

The awareness of its nigh-immortality allowed the beast to fight recklessly without suffering too much. After all, it could always regenerate through its innate ability.

A black line appeared next to the Snake’s neck and widened to create a portal. Noah came out of it while his Demonic Sword was already aiming to slash at the creature.

The Snake felt an immense danger at that point. Noah had charged the Demonic Sword with the Black Hole spell and the dark matter, and his ambition had also brought his cultivation level to an insane power. That attack could sever its neck.

The blade felt heavy as it descended toward the dark-green scales. The pressure accumulated around its sharp shape ripped the sky’s structure and twisted the light that reached that area.

The Snake didn’t have a defensive method at hand. Its scales would usually suffice against other beasts. Yet, it knew that it could die if it let that attack land on its neck.

Without defensive methods at hand, the Snake could only resort to the opposite approach. It would attack Noah before his technique landed.

Noah saw how the tail twisted and made a sharp turn to fly toward him. Determination appeared in his eyes as Snore formed in the trajectory of that attack. He wouldn’t dodge. He couldn’t lose that opportunity.

It wasn’t a case that Noah had chosen to use the Warp spell in that situation. He knew that the copies and blades couldn’t win on their own. Only the Demonic Sword could inflict deadly injuries.

Noah had waited until the Snake exposed itself before attacking. He had sacrificed most of his spells to create that opportunity. He had reappeared only when the tail destroyed the third giant fiendish copy.

However, the Snake’s flexibility had surpassed his expectation. The creature had managed to change the direction of its tail in an instant.

Noah’s mind had made the math as soon as he noticed that attack. He wouldn’t manage to cut the entire head before the tail landed on his defenses. Yet, the Snake wasn’t the only existence that liked to fight recklessly.

The Demonic Sword landed on the dark-green scales and cut them as if they were air. The blade continued to dig through the Snake’s body without meeting any hindrance until it crossed half of its width.

The living weapon hadn’t become bigger after absorbing that massive amount of energy. However, its range went far beyond its actual shape.

Only half of the Demonic Sword was inside the beast, but the damage that it caused reached even the opposite side of the creature’s neck.

Yet, when Noah was halfway through his slash, the Snake’s tail arrived. Its momentum made it pierce the dark matter that made Snore’s body, but the Blood Companion released its feathers at that point.

Snore had finished preparing its strongest attack before Noah launched his spells, but he had chosen to preserve it for critical situations. The danger that he felt coming from the tail was enough to decide to use that tool.

The feathers fell on the dark-scales and slowly ripped apart the Snake’s tissues. The tail continued to pierce dark matter as it flew through that barrage of attacks, and pieces of skin fell on the ground as it reached for Noah.

The tail became nothing more than a messy and bloody mass of tissues connected to bones, but that wasn’t enough to stop its attack.

The tail eventually pierced Snore and landed on Noah while he was still finishing his attack. The Blood Companion had managed to delay the Snake’s offensive for less than an instant, and Noah couldn’t complete his slash in that time.

Noah felt an immense force landing on the left side of his torso. His two layers of armor tried to stop that attack, but the tail pierced them even if it was badly injured.

That flung Noah away and made him crash on the ground where he dug a long underground tunnel. The terrain shattered while he tried to use the soil to stop himself from going even further away.

An explosion resounded in the area when Noah shot out of the ground to resume his battle. However, he couldn’t help but curse when he saw the condition of his opponent.

Noah had lost less than five seconds inside the ground, but the Snake had been able to destroy all the giant fiendish copies in that period.

When Noah reached the creature again, countless ice-shards were already converging on the injuries that filled its head. Some of them were already healing the beast too!

Noah didn’t waste time. His eyes went on the massive cut on its neck where most ice-shards were gathering. There was only a chunk of the Snake’s tissues keeping its head and body together. He still had the chance to stop the healing process.

His armors had reformed during his flight back to the battlefield, and his Demonic Sword had never left his hands. However, the Snake didn’t hesitate to send its still maimed tail toward its opponent again.

Determination appeared once again in Noah’s eyes. His left side hurt, but he couldn’t stop now.

The tail landed at the center of his torso after Snore appeared on its trajectory to absorb its power. Another unstoppable force engulfed Noah, but he promptly stabbed the Demonic Sword in one of the few spots on the tail that still had flesh.

He didn’t pour any energy inside the weapon, so he could use the sturdiness of the Snake’s tissues to his advantage. The blow didn’t manage to fling him away at that time. He had managed to remain in the Snake’s range by using the Demonic Sword as a handhold.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m
