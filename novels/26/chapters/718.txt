King Elbas’ words surprised most cultivators on the scene and captivated the few of them that were aware of the existence of multiple Mortal Lands. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The powerhouses didn’t reveal any emotion, but a few rank 5 cultivators couldn’t stop their expression from changing. The rest of them were mainly confused.

Even human cultivators knew that a higher plane existed due to the fall of the piece of Immortal Lands. Yet, the existence of other lower planes opened many possibilities and could broaden one’s mindset.

King Elbas didn’t wait for everyone to understand his words and continued to speak. "The piece of Immortal Lands has brought incredible benefits, as well as threatening beings. Still, what would happen if we fought existences on our level?"

The fabric of the three pillars began to merge as the inscriptions on their surface kept on shining. The air around the massive door bent and cracked under the might of the energy released by their blinding halo.

The inscriptions spread on the terrain around the structure too, and formed an intricate pattern among the three glowing columns. The lines created formations on the ground that surrounded large and complex runes.

The terrain began to fall apart as the formations started to absorb the "Breath" contained inside it, but the five silver-haired cultivators promptly threw a large number of Credits. The cores of the inscriptions stopped using the ground as their fuel when the crystals touched their surface, and the shining lines spread even further at that point.

The formation spread until it reached the abandoned Mossgrove city, and it merely avoided it as it continued to cover the entirety of the region.

The silver-haired cultivator continued to throw Credits in the middle of the shining lines to keep them active, but the inscriptions stabilized after they reached a certain width.

Whatever that structure was, it was now ready to function.

King Elbas took something from his space-ring at that point and lifted it in the air so that everyone could see the item in his grasp. The cultivators on the scene were immediately able to recognize the rank 6 black flower that had caused a considerable commotion just a few years in the ago.

"Space isn’t an element that living beings can wield." King Elbas spoke to the crowd. "But it’s something that humans can affect through the right tools!"

A series of runes appeared on the black petals when his dense "Breath" flowed inside the flower.

King Elbas waited for the modified magical plant to be ready before throwing it in the middle of the door.

The flower released its power when it came in contact with the shining lines inside the door, and a strange sound echoed in the air around it as the petals became dust.

A loud tremor followed the sound, and a vertical crack appeared at the center of the now fused pillars. The crack spread until it connected the upper part of the door with the ground.

The cultivators in the area could only see the darkness inside the crack, but a strange energy soon seeped out of that blackness.

Gasps of surprise and amazed shouts resounded in the area when the cultivators from the three forces understood that the energy was, in fact, "Breath"!

"The Elbas bloodline will give access to a different Mortal Land to this world!" King Elbas shouted as his pride spread in the environment. "May my name be indelible."

The intensity of King Elbas’ aura increased as the amazement of the other cultivators on the scene reached him. That phenomenon wasn’t limited to him since even the silver-haired Royals saw the power of their individualities increase.

Except for the powerhouses, there weren’t many existences there that could understand what was happening.

Only the other members of the Elbas family, some high-ranked soldiers in the Empire’s side, and Noah could link that event to the peculiar individuality of the ruler of the Utra nation.

’He is the fuel of his abilities, and he has just achieved something incredible.’ Noah thought as he used his powerful mind to keep his eyes on the crowned rank 6 existence.

He knew that such a mighty existence wasn’t opening a path to other Mortal Lands to benefit his world. King Elbas’ arrogance made him strive for the higher planes, but he needed to improve his bloodline to advance.

The improvements that he looked for weren’t similar to Noah’s and the Enduring demon sect’s techniques but were proper feats that had to leave their mark in history.

The descendants closest to him were also affected by that feat since they were worthy of carrying the name Elbas.

The rank 6 cultivators around him felt the urge to stop the process that was clearly benefitting their rival, but the door that led to an entire world was too appealing.

How many riches were hidden inside that Mortal Land? How many valuable resources could be found there? And, most importantly, would there be powerful enemies there?

"Our joint elements have given birth to a magical plant able to wield space. I’ve reverse-engineered that process and reproduced it in the form of a portal." King Elbas said as he moved his gaze between the rank 6 existences.

"The portal needs the five of us to work, and I can’t affect its functioning alone." King Elbas continued before concluding his explanation with a question. "Do we have an agreement?"

The golden letters only revealed the Royal’s plan, but it didn’t mention anything about its details. Also, it didn’t cover the eventual agreements that had to be sealed once the portal was open.

The powerhouses of the other nations only knew that King Elbas was inviting them to the opening of a new world.

"The Empire will join your family in your quest." God’s Right Hand said as soon as the leader of the Utra nation had finished speaking.

Noah couldn’t help but shoot a glance at the two rank 6 existences of the Empire before suppressing his thoughts. He knew some of the deeds of the god behind their organization, but his level didn’t allow him to understand his intentions fully.

Divine beings had mindsets that mortals couldn’t hope to understand, and Noah didn’t want to investigate such strong existences with his current level. Yet, he knew the political situation of the new and old continent too well to fail to predict the reactions of the other powerhouses.

"The Council will explore the new world with you." Great Elder Diana said a shortly after.

Chasing Demon hesitated for a few seconds at that point.

The situation of the Hive was different compared to the other big nations. It would benefit more from a long period of peace rather than from another war. Yet, it couldn’t let the enemy organizations gain a new source of income, and Chasing Demon would be forced to provide his energy anyway.

"The Hive will join." He said in the end, and the powerhouses gathered at the center of the area to define the terms of their agreement.
