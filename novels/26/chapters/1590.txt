Chapter 1592 1592. Control

Noah could vaguely understand what was happening. His mind was working perfectly, so he could sense how that buzzing noise was affecting his power.

His instincts warned him about a threat that he couldn’t fight. Noah felt powerless against that influence. His entire existence was under the control of the vague orders conveyed through that sound.

Noah’s group dug large tunnels through the separate dimension’s ground. They reached the second layer and continued to dive deeper into the insides of that structure.

A third layer eventually appeared in their vision. That structure was almost identical to the previous, but it featured far more chrysalises on its walls.

Noah let his instincts study his surroundings. He couldn’t cover the underground hall with his consciousness, but his senses were still active, and they could inspect the environment.

’They don’t have middle tier magical beasts in this hall,’ Noah thought while his body moved on its own.

Noah didn’t have much time to study his surroundings. His eyes went on the ground as soon as he reached the third layer, so he had only caught a glimpse of the chrysalises. Still, he couldn’t see any middle tier creature during that short inspection.

The buzzing noise forced the group to dig deeper. It led the experts into the fourth layer that featured even more chrysalises.

Noah repeated his short inspection while his eyes moved through the area and landed on the ground. He didn’t see middle tier magical beasts there either, but he began to wonder whether he had ended in the wrong hall.

The answer to his doubts arrived after the group reached the fifth layer. Noah could finally see middle tier bees inside chrysalises at that point, and that sight only made him sigh.

’Why is this even happening when we stopped so early?’ Noah wondered while the noise forced the group to dig deeper.

Risks always accompanied explorations through the Immortal Lands. That was part of the cultivation journey. Yet, many danger zones often allowed careful experts to cross them.

Noah had always been careful unless his situation required him to do otherwise. He had used the same approach inside the mountain, but it seemed that his luck had run out.

’I guess it had to happen at some point,’ Noah sighed inside his mind. ’Being careful can’t keep you safe forever. You will eventually find a danger that you can’t overcome in a plane that features rank 9 existences.’

Noah felt at peace. He had long since accepted that experts could be unlucky at times. It was impossible to avoid that randomness in a world filled with experts stronger than him.

The group reached and went past the sixth layer. More underground halls continued to appear as they kept digging through the separate dimension. Noah could even lay his eyes on chrysalises that contained upper tier bees at some point.

The buzzing noise intensified as the group dived toward the depths of the separate dimension. That sound eventually lost any obstruction when they reached the twentieth layer, but their eyes couldn’t see anything since they felt forced to stare at the ground.

The noise eventually allowed them to raise their heads. The group could finally inspect their surroundings, and that scene made their minds freeze.

Countless silk-like threads covered the floor, walls, and ceiling of that underground hall. Noah couldn’t see any tunnel in front of him, but he was still unable to turn, so he couldn’t check the area behind him.

The threads converged toward a ten meters tall chrysalis that was the source of the buzzing noise. Noah and the others bowed as soon as they saw that cocoon, and their heads continued to look at the ground for a whole hour before the sound forced them to straighten their position.

"You will soon become part of my pack," An eerie female voice suddenly resounded from the cocoon. "Rejoice! I turn you into my children and lead you into a glorious conquest."

The buzzing didn’t stop while those human words spread through the underground hall. That sound forced Noah to step forward and bow again to accept the expert’s blessing.

"I acknowledge your power," The voice resounded again. "You will be the first to transform into one of my children."

A dense liquid came out of the scarlet floor and enveloped Noah. He felt that material invade his tissues and try to alter his fabric to improve its overall power.

However, the black hole suddenly started rotating again and took over that part of the process. The organ forced all the energy transmitted by the dense liquid to pass through its dark matter before sending it back to Noah’s body.

Noah’s power slowly increased. He felt that every cell of his body improved under that intense nourishment. The dense liquid contained enough nutrients to trigger a transformation, so he could seize a lot of power from it. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The expert inside the cocoon continued to summon more dense liquid, but the black hole never allowed that energy to transform Noah. That resource even accepted the organ’s authority and let it take complete control over the procedure.

"What is happening?" The female voice suddenly resounded again. "Why don’t you transform?"

Noah wanted to reply, but he couldn’t move. He could only bathe in the marvelous feeling generated by the fast growth of his centers of power. The process didn’t only involve his body. Even his dantian, mind, and black hole improved under those nutrients.

"What are you?" The voice asked before a dense wave of mental energy seeped inside Noah’s body.

The expert inside the cocoon inspected every inch of Noah’s body. Her mental energy even studied the black hole, but she didn’t seem satisfied with her discoveries.

"Speak!" The voice eventually exclaimed. "Tell me why my energy can’t force you to transform."

Noah suddenly regained control of his body. He crouched while his consciousness instinctively expanded and gave him a clear view of the entire underground hall.

The area didn’t have tunnels, but it was quite big. It featured only one cocoon, but the power inside that form seemed able to overcome all the other bees in the higher layers.

’She must be in the ninth rank,’ Noah concluded after that brief inspection. ’What can I even tell her now?’

"My body already is the epitome of perfection," Noah explained while straightening his position. "Your liquid can force me to improve, but it can’t change my species."

"Are you telling me that I can’t improve you?!" The voice asked in an angry tone.

"Quite the opposite," Noah continued. "Your liquid has no harmful properties. It has realized that my species is already perfect, so it only focuses on providing nutrients."

The expert inside the cocoon went silent, but Noah could sense from her influence that she was accepting that explanation. Her aura could affect any existence under the ninth rank, so Noah’s words had to be the truth.

"Well," The voice continued, "I will move on the others then."

"If I may," Noah exclaimed before the noise took away his control over his body again.

"Speak freely," The expert replied.

Noah cleared his throat before trying to find a way out of that situation. "I presume that you are Radiant Eyes. I would like to know your intentions before choosing my next words."
