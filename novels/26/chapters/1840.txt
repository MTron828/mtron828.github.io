Chapter 1841 - 1841. Memories

King Elbas’ suggestion didn’t work as intended. Noah’s group featured stubborn and crazy experts, and they couldn’t hold back from giving voice to their suggestions while the study of the head continued.

"You can turn him into a magical beast and let Alexander eat him," Wilfred suggested.​​

"I’m not sharing my prey," Noah snorted, "And the transformation isn’t so easy. I don’t know if I can get past his innate abilities."

"Can’t we mutate him and see what he has to say once he doesn’t belong to Heaven and Earth’s system anymore?" Robert asked.

"Again, he is a rank 9 cultivator," Noah sighed. "I would already be inside his mind if I had any confidence in the matter."

"We should cut him," Sword Saint added.

"How would that help?" King Elbas complained, and a helpless sigh escaped his mouth when he saw Sword Saint shrugging his shoulders.

Lord Lewis’ situation was desperate, but the scenes that unfolded in his eyes were beyond reason. Those rank 8 experts were in the middle of a battle capable of turning the entire world upside down, but they chose to remain inside the dark world to study him.

Moreover, most of their interactions made no sense. All of them appeared serious until words came out of their mouths. It was as if they were waiting to see who came up with the most idiotic plan.

However, one of the cultivators didn’t speak at all. Lord Lewis’ eyes soon fell on the silent Divine Demon who supported his chin with one hand.

Divine Demon appeared in a daze when he studied the floating head. His piercing gaze seemed to go past the flesh containing understanding that only those at the peak of the cultivation journey could achieve. Lord Lewis couldn’t help but remain astonished in front of that level of concentration. He even felt respect surging inside his existence.

Then, Divine Demon performed a sharp movement with his arm to point at the floating head. Pure resolve shone out of his figure as he opened his mouth to announce what appeared to be the most meaningful words in his entire life. "I challenge you to reveal all our secrets!"

The other experts fell silent. Their eyes went on Divine Demon before moving to Lord Lewis. Some of them even showed a tinge of hope.

"I refuse?" Lord Lewis replied in a confused tone.

"This one is smart," Divine Demon sighed while lowering his arm and shaking his head. "Heaven and Earth have already given them a counter to my final technique."

"You didn’t use any technique," Lord Lewis couldn’t help but answer in front of the embodiment of idiocy.

"Please, don’t feed the idiot," King Elbas said in a helpless tone. "He might really develop a technique if you keep contradicting him."

"Focus on being a good floating head," Noah snorted. "It’s in Heaven and Earth’s interest to keep me as your main opponent."

"What are you even saying?" Lord Lewis scoffed. "You might have become the embodiment of Heaven and Earth’s flaws, but you are by no means their main concern. The dragons and the monster are far more dangerous than you."

"It worked," Divine Demon commented before exploding into a loud laugh and taking out a jug of wine from his space-ring.

"Maybe let him finish to speak next time," Robert sighed, but Divine Demon didn’t seem to hear those words.

Lord Lewis suddenly realized that he had revealed an important detail. He struggled to believe that those words had come out of his mouth, and his gaze suddenly went on the expert laughing and drinking. Pure fear appeared in his eyes when he saw how clueless Divine Demon was about his unreasonable power.

"A monster then," Noah’s voice suddenly reached Lord Lewis’ ears and forced him to divert his gaze from Divine Demon. "How does that fit with the history of the plane? I thought the dragons already expressed the four fundamental aspects of the world."

Lord Lewis felt so scared about what he could say that he directly bit his tongue off. However, the workshop rebuilt it in an instant and forced him to stare at the three cold smiles fixed on him.

Noah, King Elbas, and Alexander were doing their best to think of a way to crack Lord Lewis’ mind open. They went over their entire arsenal and realized that their methods wouldn’t be effective in that situation.

The few methods that could work were far too dangerous. Noah, King Elbas, and Alexander had abilities and items that could make them pierce the expert’s memories, but Lord Lewis belonged to Heaven and Earth’s system. The rulers might have placed countless defenses in his mind.

"We must work together," Noah eventually admitted. "I can use the dark world to replicate his memories and avoid the dangers actually contained in his mind."

"I can create a bridge between his mind and your technique," King Elbas revealed. "Can you open a stable crack?"

"Opening it is easy," Noah explained, "But we can’t go too deep into his mind. He would just transform what gets too close to his influence."

Noah and King Elbas turned toward Alexander at that point. They were out of options even after deciding to collaborate. They lacked something capable of controlling the memories from the outside.

"I have thirty-one different mental abilities that involve memories," Alexander revealed. "I’m picking a few of them so that Elbas can adapt the item beforehand." Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

"You shouldn’t stay inside the dark world once the technique starts," Noah announced. "It’s better to have fewer interferences."

"What should we do?" Robert asked.

"Make sure to warn us if an upper tier creature is about to fall on us," Noah replied.

"We’ll just throw Divine Demon at it," Robert laughed, but his expression turned serious when he shot upward to leave the dark world.

Steven and the others followed him, leaving only Noah, Alexander, and King Elbas inside the technique.

Noah provided dark matter that King Elbas used to build formations inside the dark world while Alexander reviewed his abilities. The hybrid eventually showed his techniques to his companions, and the three of them picked some together.

King Elbas began to build the mental bridge at that point, and Noah made sure to reinforce the formations and prepare the dark world for the transformation.

The cultivator quickly completed his task and stood up to point at a specific spot on Lord Lewis’ head. The workshop activated and opened a hole there, and King Elbas didn’t hesitate to stab a half-ethereal golden straw inside.

Golden shades immediately spread through the dark world. The straw resonated with Noah’s technique and affected the images that it showed. The darkness dispersed to make room for King Elbas’ iconic color, but those shades were only a temporary event.

Alexander placed one palm on the floating head before touching his forehead with the other. The connection was complete now, and the experts didn’t hesitate to activate the technique.

"Tell me about the monster," Noah ordered, and a humming noise suddenly spread through the dark world.

"Heaven and Earth’s defenses," Alexander explained before anyone could raise questions. "I can go deeper, but they will devour his mind once they understand that they have nothing else to destroy."

"We have to be quick then," King Elbas chuckled, and Alexander frowned as the blood that had turned azure began to shine.

Lord Lewis rolled his eyes as multiple humming noises echoed through the dark world until the golden light disappeared and blackness filled the area.

Noah initially felt that the dark world had lost connection with the inscribed straw, but he suddenly saw something moving among that blackness.

The familiar scene of the void bending to give birth to empty figures appeared in the trio’s vision, but the creature’s size in Lord Lewis’ memories was insane. The white sky was right under it, and the entity appeared as big as a quarter of it.
