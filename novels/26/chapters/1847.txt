Chapter 1848 - 1848. Dead zones

The event didn’t involve only Noah and his group. All the rank 9 dragons and the leaders went through the same process. Their bodies turned ethereal as gales made of chaotic laws filled the battlefield.

Noah couldn’t sense the power that caused his ethereal form. He wasn’t even sure that his initial idea reflected the true nature of his state. After all, his centers of power weren’t reacting to the event. He didn’t feel anything unusual.​​

Other ideas started to appear in his mind after he saw how the many enemies reacted to the event. The cultivators and the swarm fighting against the rank 9 dragons had to prioritize their escape at the sight of the raging gales. Still, the solid stage woman wanted to kill her opponents even if she had to sacrifice herself to complete the task.

However, confusion had appeared on her face as soon as her opponents became immune to the storms. Noah could even inspect her through the small openings that spread among the raging gales. The woman found herself unable to see the dragons. The dense separate area that their powerful existences created had also vanished after the event.

’We didn’t turn immaterial,’ Noah concluded in his mind at that point. ’We are inside a separate dimension.’

Noah summoned the entirety of his understanding of space as he waved his hands to find a handhold on the layer of that dimension. Yet, he failed to reach anything. He couldn’t even understand how he had entered that separate area.

Noah tried to summon his power after the first test turned out to be a failure. His darkness, mental energy, and dark matter could come out of his figure and create techniques as if he were in the normal world, but they appeared weaker than usual. That separate dimension seemed to suppress his power, and he didn’t hesitate to bend his fingers to create claws ready to force his way out of the area.

"What are you even doing?" The green dragon suddenly asked while appearing above Noah with the other leaders.

"I wanted to study this technique," Noah honestly replied as King Elbas and the others gathered behind him.

"Do you even realize where you are?" The time dragon sighed before roaring toward the creatures who were still high in the sky.

All the dragons gathered at that point. Noah’s group, the four leaders, and the various underlings grouped right above the surface and waited for someone to give orders.

"This is one of space dragon’s techniques," The time dragon explained while closing its eyes and expanding its aura until it covered the entire group. "It creates a perfect copy of the world and takes every ally inside it. You are in a temporary space."

Noah couldn’t help but glance at the shadowy figure in astonishment. In his opinion, his understanding of space was good, but his methods were mere tricks compared to the abilities that the space dragon could deploy. The creature had turned an entire army immune to external influences. The sheer power showed by that technique was simply impossible to evaluate.

"The fundamental aspects of the world can fuse to create complicated techniques," The green dragon continued as its ancient aura intensified. "Your position loses meaning once you can bend time and space to your will."

The scenery immediately transformed after the green dragon completed its line. Noah didn’t feel any pressure, and his vision never went dark. Still, a shining environment that featured a vast plain covered by small scarlet bushes suddenly replaced the storms.

Noah couldn’t even understand when that transformation happened. He didn’t feel anything, but everything around him had changed. The area only featured weak winds even. The plain seemed the most peaceful environment in the entirety of the stormy regions.

The winds didn’t pierce his figure anymore. They stopped when they touched his skin and tried to shatter back into the environment. Yet, the destruction naturally released by his body made their chaotic laws remain attached to him, who quickly absorbed them to transform them into fuel for his black hole.

Noah confirmed that he had returned to the material world. His body could interact with the environment, and the magical plants on the surface instinctively slowed down their growth in front of so many powerful existences.

"Where are we?" Noah couldn’t refrain from asking.

The absence of violent storms made the region quite peculiar. The bushes didn’t have anything to do with the lack of intense winds. They simply existed on the dark land and radiated their iconic scarlet light.

"There aren’t many of these regions among the storms," The time dragon explained. "Cultivators, magical beasts, and hybrids have given them different names throughout the eras, but dead zones remains the most fitting. These places won’t evolve without external help in the end."

"They are random creations," King Elbas exclaimed while diving toward the ground and stabbing his fingers on the dark terrain. "The chaotic laws have created something that they can’t affect anymore. This land is the unavoidable mistake that every system needs."

"How can a system need mistakes?" Steven promptly asked before his worried eyes fell on the four upper tier dragons.

Steven still didn’t feel comfortable talking with his companions while those powerful creatures hovered around him. Existences at those levels could easily take the lack of interest in their presence as an insult, and they always exacted a price in those cases.

His behavior was normal. His companions also shared his worries and hesitation. King Elbas and Noah were simple exceptions who could pursue their interests even if the situation appeared completely out of their control.

"Nothing in this world is perfect," King Elbas revealed while his curiosity spread through the region to understand the nature of the surface. "Every system has flaws. It’s only a matter of exploiting them at that point."

"Do you want to exploit this region?" Noah asked.

"Of course!" King Elbas announced. "Imagine if I could replicate this peculiar ground everywhere. We would have a proper countermeasure against the storms."

A growl suddenly spread through the area and shattered the mental waves that King Elbas was using to study the terrain. The death dragon had given voice to a cry that left everyone confused. Noah couldn’t understand why the creature would stop that procedure, and a frown inevitably appeared on his face.

"Why?" Noah asked. "We can replicate the peculiar composition of the ground and apply it into multiple spots. Traveling across the storms wouldn’t be a problem if we learn about the dead zones!"

"The dead zones are treasures that everyone values," The time dragon explained. "Their uniqueness is a vital part of their power. Leave them be."

"Why is that so important?" Noah asked. "It’s just matter in my eyes."

"Live long enough inside the storms, and you will understand," The green dragon sighed. "My pack controls four of them for now. They are the perfect place where to create armies meant to fight Heaven and Earth."
