Chapter 1511 1511. Plan

Noah didn’t go all-out even after he landed on the ground, and the two rank 8 leaders did the same. The three of them were unaware whether the moles’ pack would show up again, and they didn’t want to be in a position where those creatures could surprise them.

The two leaders attacked Noah. The monkey’s chest inflated to launch a dense soundwave. The wolf shot toward him, but it didn’t use its incredible speed due to the innate ability of the other creature.

Noah had landed on the ground only to attract the leaders’ attention, but he had no intention of fighting fairly. Magical beasts would almost always focus on any being with a human shape, and Noah didn’t want to end up in the middle of two rank 8 creatures.

His body transformed into a black blade that shot backward. Night fused with the environment before the soundwave could reach it, and an explosion happened on that spot.

The shockwaves released after the detonation of the monkey’s attack forced Noah out of his movement technique and made him spat blood. The wolf didn’t hesitate to reach him at that point, and Noah could soon see the creature’s tall figure jumping on him from his side.

Noah could barely face one rank 8 magical beast, let alone two. However, he had his improved companions by his side, but he didn’t want to unleash their power while he was near the tree.

Snore quickly materialized to intercept the wolf’s attack. The snake’s massive figure created a natural barrier that stopped the creature’s leap and forced it to focus on its new opponent.

The wolf easily pieced Snore’s body, but a wave of violent dark matter engulfed it before it could launch another attack. The Blood Companion was pure destruction now. Even its insides featured the same substance that made its dark beam.

The violent dark matter didn’t manage to injure the leader, but pieces of its fur vanished when that wave of energy engulfed it. The wolf’s anger surged before it leapt again and pierced Snore’s body. Yet, it didn’t find Noah when it reached the other side.

A soundwave threatened to crash on Snore, but the snake transformed into a cloud that vanished once the attack exploded. A crack appeared on Blood Companion’s ethereal figure, but the wolf ended up enduring most of the blow.

Snore was still a Blood Companion, so its body would disperse once Noah went too far away. The attack of the rank 8 monkey would normally inflict severe injuries to its ethereal figure, but the snake didn’t stay in the area long enough to endure the entirety of the blow.

The wolf gave voice to an angry howl before turning toward the monkey. The creature seemed about to jump toward its previous opponent, but a cross-shaped slash suddenly crashed on its body and forced it to turn again.

Noah had stopped only to launch the slash. He had immediately resumed his retreat when the wolf turned again. The creature couldn’t contain its anger and chased him at full speed, but Snore appeared on its path when it was about to reach him.

The monkey launched another soundwave while the wolf was busy fighting Snore, but the snake disappeared before the attack reached the area at that time.

The soundwave ended up crashing directly on the wolf’s body. Blood flowed out of the creature’s mouth. It seemed that the attack had damaged its internal organs.

Noah slashed toward the wolf before it could turn toward the monkey. The creature was livid at that point. It had no idea who to attack, but it eventually charged toward Noah.

’Almost there,’ Noah thought once he reached the edges of the region.

The tall tree was far away from that spot. Fergie would have a decent chance to let the fruit grow and seize it once it was fully ripe now. Noah only had to keep the two leaders busy for as long as possible. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The wolf reached Noah in an instant, but Snore didn’t appear. He turned toward the creature, slashing with both his blades while a wave of dark matter surrounded his figure.

The blades and the wolf clashed, releasing a shockwave that shattered the ground. Noah’s arms released screeching noises, and the swords threatened to break, but the dark matter and the unstable substance kept them intact.

Still, the impact flung Noah away and made him dig a long hole through the azure ground. His body felt sore once the empowerment given by the Demonic Sword vanished. The skin on his elbows, wrists, and shoulders had also shattered.

’That was dumb,’ Noah thought before wearing a broad smile.

Facing a rank 8 creature with his bare body had been a stupid idea, but Noah was willing to lose his arms to understand how far he was from the eighth rank.

Noah couldn’t remain deep in his thoughts since the wolf immediately leapt toward him. The creature wouldn’t let him go now that it had managed to put him on the ground.

An invisible force flung the wolf upward and created a long mark on its chest. The Pterodactyl became visible for less than an instant before fusing with the world again and resuming its offensive.

Night attacked the creature again while it was mid-air, and Snore quickly formed to wrap its immense body around the wolf. The snake restrained its limbs and bit on its neck as violent dark matter flowed out of its mouth.

Noah straightened his position and pulled his blades back. His knees bent as the Demonic Sword’s black hole released dark matter that covered both weapons.

His ambition also activated. His cultivation level increased and reached the limits of the seventh rank. Noah was ready to launch his strongest attack, but the monkey’s offensive forced him to retreat.

Snore quickly transformed into a cloud that dispersed before the dense soundwave exploded. The wolf endured the entirety of the blow again, but no slash crashed on its body at that time.

Noah flew around the wolf and neared the monkey. He came out of his movement technique to resume his previous position and gather his power.

The monkey’s chest inflated at that sight, but the wolf jumped on the creature before it could launch its attack. Noah could take his time to amass as much dark matter as possible before launching his double lunge.

Two beams shot out of Noah’s figure. One of them was pitch black, while the other was almost invisible. A wave of dark matter covered both and enhanced their destructive capabilities.

The two attacks fused mid-air. They transformed into an unstable piercing force before crashing on the monkey’s belly. The attack destroyed its fur, and Noah could even see a drop of blood flowing out of the landing spot.

’I did it!’ Noah shouted in his mind when he saw that minute drop of dark-red blood.

Noah had to use his ambition, the full power of his Demonic Sword, the unstable substance, an upper tier weapon, and dark matter, but he had finally managed to pierce the skin of a rank 8 creature.

The actual amount of damage inflicted in the clash didn’t matter. Noah could barely contain his excitement. He had finally approached a rank 8 battle prowess.
