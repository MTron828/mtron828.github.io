Chapter 1637 - 1637. Assault

Having distorted space inside a dimensional tunnel wouldn’t typically force the experts to worry about their surroundings. However, Divine Demon had already confirmed the species of the pack in charge of that environment, and Noah knew something about those magical beasts.

The Space Hounds were unusual creatures. Very few records kept track of their existence. Noah had learnt about them inside the libraries of the Sailbrird family. Still, he had guessed the rest of their features through his expertise.

The areas of distorted space completed the puzzle about his idea of those magical beasts. It became clear that the Space Hounds could walk freely through the edges of the dimensions, and that led to a scary conclusion.

Those magical beasts could already be around the group. Noah had no way of confirming the presence of that threat from inside the dimensional tunnel, but he could guess that some scout had already noticed their arrival.

The Space Hounds weren’t famous for their intelligence, but Noah’s worry came from the usual behavior of the magical beasts. The arrival of an external threat inside a lair would often force the entire pack to act, and that meant attracting dangerous specimens.

"Prepare for battle," Noah whispered, but all the experts in the area heard him.

His words were for his companions, but some of the experts from the human organizations listened to his advice. His friends did the same, while the most arrogant cultivators decided to ignore that warning.

It was hard to believe in such a warning when the group only found pieces of fur. The distorted space didn’t even classify as a clue to the Hounds’ presence since it could be a common sight inside dimensional tunnels.

The layers among the dimensions prevented Noah from learning more about that fauna, but his instincts told him that a threat was approaching him. His dangerous sensation also intensified as the group continued to dive through the dimensional tunnel.

The Demonic Sword and his companions came out of the separate space on their own after the dangerous sensation reached a critical intensity. Those creatures were almost sure that something was about to fall on Noah, so they prepared for a fierce battle.

Mocks resounded through the dimensional tunnel when the arrogant experts saw that scene. They couldn’t understand why Noah was so scared, but an explanation soon appeared in their vision.

The space around the group suddenly began to bend. The terrain and air in the area twisted until it gained dark features. It seemed that something had broken, but that was only the beginning of the event.

A series of tall figures slowly flew out of that distorted space. Dog-like creatures with silverish fur and a series of black signs on their back came out of those spots and leapt toward the experts without bothering to launch battle cries. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Noah’s senses immediately screamed. Most of those rank 8 magical beasts were in the lower and middle tier, but two were in the upper tier.

’This is a proper platoon!’ Noah shouted in his mind at that sight.

The pack wasn’t underestimating the invading team. Those magical beasts had sent enough troops to wipe them away, but those creatures appeared far below the average in terms of pure battle prowess.

The ability to travel through dimensions was an incredible tool that Heaven and Earth had definitely punished. Noah didn’t believe that such unique magical beasts could keep their innate skills without having serious drawbacks in other fields.

Heaven and Earth usually lowered the fertility of a species to punish it, but they took drastic measures when certain innate abilities went overboard. They had done the same with the Light-devouring Dragons, so Noah guessed that his opponents had to be inside specific standards to remain outside those rulers’ radar.

The tall Hounds shot forward, and their figures turned ethereal while flying across the dimensional tunnel. The experts quickly launched attacks, but their spells crossed those magical beasts and landed on the dark walls behind the distorted space.

The two upper tier specimens immediately went after the experts from the Monneay family. The three cultivators were in the group’s lead, so they became the target of those magical beasts.

The rest of the pack assaulted the group. Small teams of lower and middle tier Space Hounds charged at the other experts while showing their fangs to the world.

Noah studied the creatures flying toward him. He waited until those magical beasts turned material, and his blade immediately flashed at that sight.

The four magical beasts in the lower tier that had decided to attack Noah quickly regained a material form, but a storm of singularities landed on their figures. Their bodies almost disappeared after those attacks crossed them.

The rest of the group handled that threat quite well. The Space Hounds were nothing more than hungry magical beasts after their bodies returned material, so a few spells could take them down.

That didn’t apply to the two upper tier specimens. They appeared able to turn specific spots of their body ethereal and dodge most of the attacks that flew in their direction.

The exchange for the experts of the Monneay family turned out poorly. Their opponents were quite threatening, and one of them managed to reach one of the cultivators.

The expert found the creature’s teeth stabbed on her arm before she even had a chance to retreat. The cultivator had tried all her techniques to keep the Space Hound away, but the magical beast didn’t let those abilities reach it.

The creature turned most of its body ethereal before materializing its teeth and ripping away the cultivator’s arm. Nothing could stop that attack. Even King Elbas would struggle in the task.

Noah’s focus returned to his friends after he witnessed the cultivator losing her arm. His Demonic Sword cut the air non-stop, and sharpness acc.u.mulated on his surroundings.

Noah could make singularities appear whenever one of the magical beasts in the area turned material, but one of the experts from the human forces seemed to do better than him.

The cultivator had created a gravitational pull around him. The force attracted the creatures even in their ethereal form, and it seemed able to damage them in that status.

The technique ended up backfiring on the expert since a horde of magical beasts gathered around him and tried to jump on his figure at the same time. Noah had to handle that issue, and his companions soon supported him.

A series of singularities that carried a dark aura opened around the expert and allowed him to ignore the imminent threats. The cultivator couldn’t sense much among that destruction, but he quickly turned toward Noah to nod.

The expert was expressing his gratitude, and Luke didn’t hesitate to describe him. The cultivator knew him as Isaac from the Putgan family. He wasn’t famous, but he wasn’t unknown either.

Harold, Althea, and other experts who had benefitted from Noah’s calculated destruction tried to exploit that event and seize a few intact corpses. The Space Hounds could lead to the next discoveries regarding teleports and separate dimensions, so all the group members wanted those creatures.

Still, when the experts were about to contend the few intact corpses, King Elbas appeared among them and stored those bodies before returning near Noah.
