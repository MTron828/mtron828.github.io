Chapter 1796 - 1796. Corpse

The energy left inside the jellyfish spread inside the dark world as its head shattered. The dark matter barely managed to contain those dense waves of power, and some of them inevitably reached the void to disperse.

Shafu ended up materializing itself among the void. Its massive size made it cover the entirety of the battlefield with its body, and its wings quickly flapped to send some of the dispersing energy back into the dark world.

King Elbas turned his attention toward the empty creatures that surrounded the group. Some of the magical beasts had already started to fight them, but their abilities had no effect.

The expert deployed the same inscriptions that he had set on the hole. Floating formations quickly appeared around him and locked on the empty creatures before releasing a series of slashes that carried Noah and Sword Sant’s power.

King Elbas added many layers of inscription to make sure that the formation had enough power to deal with that crisis. His priority was to give Noah and Sword Saint enough room to share the benefits of the hunt.

The empty existences slowly retreated as Noah, Sword Saint, and the golden formation released attacks that could damage and kill their opponents, and the scales of the battle ultimately ended up in their favor.

The creatures with no body and aura stopped launching attacks and retreated at high speed. They waited until they exited the group’s range before fusing back with the void.

Noah and the others spent a few seconds inspecting the now empty scene before turning toward the jellyfish. Its body was still inside the dark matter, and the same went for a large chunk of its energy.

"Don’t play around," King Elbas announced as soon as peace spread among the group. "I’ve seen you hiding part of the energy inside your technique. I’m sorry. You can’t have those nutrients all for yourself."

"It didn’t hurt to try," Noah said while shrugging his shoulders and making the dark world draw closer. "I’m surprised you noticed that. I made sure to hide it really well."

An obscured trail of dark matter became visible and allowed the experts to see that Noah had tried to keep a large amount of energy hidden inside his technique.

"I have been too obvious," Noah sighed while retracting his companions and moving the entirety of his ambition toward the dark world.

The technique immediately grew stronger and denser. It became a proper prison that pushed the energy and the jellyfish toward its center. It even used some fuel to restore the parts that were about to fall in the eighth rank.

"Is this how a leader should act?" Elsie asked as a tinge of annoyance appeared on her face. "Do you even steal from your underlings?"

Noah glanced at her and gave voice to a laugh before snapping his fingers. The experts immediately stopped seeing the insides of the dark world, and even the powerful aura radiated by the creature stopped flowing into the void.

Some flares of energy still managed to escape the technique, but the dispersion was far less after the enhancement provided by the ambition. Some human and animal faces even appeared on the outsides of the dark world, and the suppression only grew stronger.

It became clear that Noah could have hidden the energy if he really wanted. No one would have been able to sense it inside that version of the dark world.

"Why did you even try then?" Elsie asked as confusion filled her face.

"It’s fun to tease Xavier," Noah explained.

His friends couldn’t help but laugh at that scene, but the experts from the human organizations remained speechless. They had just fought a rank 9 creature, but those existences still found the time to play around.

"You’ll eventually get it once you spend enough time with us," The Foolery exclaimed while nearing the cultivator and patting her shoulder.

Elsie’s expression became blank when she saw the pig patting her shoulder. She had spent her life inside a human organization, so she didn’t know how to react to that unreasonable scene.

"The pig really has a talent," Divine Demon commented when he noticed that annoyance slowly built inside Elsie’s mind. "We should make a challenge! Let’s see who can make Xavier angrier!"

"How could I even refuse?" The pig shouted while lifting its head. "How can your miracles even defeat unbound talent?"

"That’s the spirit!" Divine Demon shouted as energy flowed out of his figure.

Noah and the others felt a chill running down their spine. The two most unreasonable existences in the entire higher plane were challenging themselves. King Elbas’ friends couldn’t help but glance at him and show their deep sorrow.

"It has been nice knowing you," Wilfred exclaimed.

"Be sure to leave your space-rings behind," Noah reminded him.

"Death comes to us all," Robert sighed. "Friends are deadlier than foes at times."

King Elbas didn’t take the matter lightly. He had wielded a new upper tier fiery spear as soon as he heard that the challenge concerned him. However, a sudden burst of lightning bolts pierced the dark world and created large holes in the technique.

"How can it be still alive?" Steven asked as the entire group performed evasive maneuvers to dodge the incoming attacks.

"It isn’t," Noah explained. "The damned tentacles are discharging their remaining energy!"

"Can you suppress it?" King Elbas asked while taking out a different set of items.

The answer to his question arrived right away. The entirety of the dark world crumbled as a barrage of lightning bolts pierced its insides. The energy contained by the technique began to vanish into the void without the suppression of the dark matter. The experts saw the result of their efforts dispersing right in front of their eyes.

"Change of plan!" Noah roared. "Get the energy before it leaves the area. You won’t have to split it afterward."

The order made all the experts prepare to shoot forward, but many of them ended up hesitating. The jellyfish was missing the upper part of its body, but its tentacles were still intact and released multiple barrages of lightning bolts everywhere in the environment.

Nearing the creature would give less time to dodge the lightning bolts. Each of those attacks even had bottom rank 9 power, so many experts decided to give up on the energy to preserve their lives.

Noah, King Elbas, Wilfred, Divine Demon, Robert, Steven, and many magical beasts shot ahead without showing any hesitation. They dodged the lightning bolts on their way and approached the trembling tentacles.

It was clear that the jellyfish was dead, but its tentacles were working on their own due to the law fused with its fabric. Those limbs were aware of the creature’s d.e.s.i.r.es and fear, so they used their last energies to make the humans pay.

Noah completely ignored the lightning bolts as he shot toward the dispersing energy. His dark world expanded again once he reached a suitable spot, and his ambition flowed inside the technique to make it able to deal with the fuel.

The jellyfish’s remaining power slowly vanished. The lightning bolts didn’t come out of the tentacles anymore. Even those limbs just started to hang from the maimed head.

Author’s notes: The side effects of the vaccine are here. I don’t know if a night of sleep will make them disappear, but I guess that resting won’t hurt. I’ll take a one-day break on "Demonic Sword" and write only one chapter for Chaos’ Heir tomorrow(two if I really feel like it/better). Chapters will go back to normal on the 5th. I’m honestly sorry for putting you through this, especially so close to my past fever. I’ll try to become immune to this stuff.
