Chapter 1847 - 1847. Ethereal

The dragon felt pissed. Noah was basically ordering it around, and he wasn’t even trying to be polite in the process. However, his idea made far more sense than it wished it to do.

The aspect of the world inherited by the death dragon made it unable to think of approaches that could save lives. Yet, it wasn’t alone on the battlefield, and its power still allowed it to share information with its companions.​​

The death dragon raised its head and gave voice to a deafening roar that forced every existence on Heaven and Earth’s side to cover their ears. The flying c.o.c.kroaches clearly couldn’t defend against the attack, so many of them died to protect the strongest members of their swarm.

The leader set off and returned toward the battlefield at that point. Noah could only stare as the massive beast left his vision, but his companions didn’t give him the chance to remain immersed in his thoughts.

"What were you even thinking?!" King Elbas shouted before adding curses that Noah had never heard in his entire life.

"I’m starting to think that you enjoy this," Steven commented while approaching Noah with the rest of the group.

"How can you still have doubts about that?" Wilfred sighed and spread his arms when his gaze crossed Noah’s eyes.

"It’s fine," Divine Demon laughed while lying on the air closing his eyes to wait for the battle to turn into a massive escape.

"Crazy leads to victory," Robert exclaimed before lowering his voice and continuing. "Though you could have been a bit more polite."

"Is this already over?" Sword Saint scoffed. "I didn’t get the chance to cut anyone."

"You cut half of the rank 8 cultivators on your own," Alexander contradicted him.

"Weaklings don’t count," Sword Saint snorted. "I want a real fight."

"We’ll have plenty of fights once we leave this area," Noah explained. "Heaven and Earth have confirmed that we have joined the dragons. They won’t treat us as normal dangers anymore."

"Do we just join a war that doesn’t belong to us then?" Steven asked.

"This war involves the entire world," Noah contradicted the expert. "It belongs to every living being inside it. Still, I agree with you. We can’t keep sticking around with the dragons. We must make use of Heaven and Earth’s fairness as long as it still shields us from major threats."

"That will put us back to the starting point," Wilfred commented. "I don’t mind hunting and slowly approaching the ninth rank, especially after what we learnt from the cultivator, but Heaven and Earth’s suppression will be stronger now."

"I have two plans," Noah announced. "One is reasonable. The other is crazy."

"Crazy first," King Elbas promptly said.

"You know about that," Noah scoffed. "I want to hunt other rank 9 existences and inspect their memories to learn more about the last realm."

"That’s not crazy," King Elbas shook his head. "That’s only almost crazy. Our battle prowess already makes us able to deal with rank 9 cultivators."

"We can always perform the hunt in the cities inside the sky if that doesn’t suit your tastes," Noah mocked.

"If only we knew how to get there," King Elbas sighed.

"What’s the reasonable plan?" Alexander asked before Noah and King Elbas found a passage that could lead them to the most dangerous place in the entirety of the world.

"We ask the dragons to lead us somewhere nice, obviously," Noah shrugged his shoulders. "The stormy regions are everchanging, but they have also been the home of rank 9 existences for countless years. They can’t be just winds and monsters."

The experts accepted the second plan far better than the first. The stormy regions had accommodated rank 9 existences for eras. Supreme Thief had even built his inheritance there.

There was a high chance that other experts had done the same. Noah’s group didn’t care too much about the inheritances since their power had become too personal to benefit from techniques born from different existences. However, they could still seize valuable resources from them.

Noah didn’t feel any appeal toward the resources since his dark world, workshop, and ambition could cover every part of his creation without requiring special materials. His dark matter could imitate everything anyway, so he didn’t need anything specific.

Still, Noah would feel too arrogant if he underestimated all the rank 9 existences capable of building special environments inside the stormy regions. Supreme Thief was a monster in the end, and he couldn’t be the only one. The experts could learn a lot from those old existences, especially since most of them opposed Heaven and Earth.

Everyone in Noah’s team knew how desperately they required help against Heaven and Earth. The rulers had access to countless methods, counters, and troops. They had managed to keep the monster outside the sky and the army of dragons at bay while continuing to strive toward perfection for countless years. The experts required as much knowledge as possible just to make their opponents encounter some difficulties.

Noah didn’t reveal the entirety of his plans to his group. Strange ideas appeared in his mind whenever he thought about the empty monster floating in the void. Those who opposed Heaven and Earth instinctively attracted it, but its state as an enemy of the rulers was undeniable.

Noah didn’t know if copying the empty creatures’ abilities was possible with his law. Those monsters literally had nothing to imitate. They represented the very opposite of existences.

"It’s happening," Divine Demon announced after the experts had fallen deep into their thoughts to review their current situation. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The group glanced at the sky at that point. The battle among the leaders was still raging, but something had changed. They had even become able to inspect part of the techniques deployed on that battlefield.

The death dragon was spitting miasmatic waves of attacks that resembled flames inside cracks that led somewhere into the storms. The solid stage woman didn’t understand the reason behind its actions, but the other leaders didn’t give her the chance to stop the process.

The swarm of flying c.o.c.kroaches surrounded the creatures and devoured their scales, but the radiance released by the silver dragon healed those injuries in an instant. Some attacks even felt erratic since the green dragon made attacks go forward and backward in time to catch its opponent by surprise.

The solid stage woman surprisingly kept up with the strange, powerful and relentless offensive, but the reason behind her superior power soon became clear to Noah and the others. Her strength seemed connected to her eyes since the opposing abilities shattered whenever she blinked. Yet, she also wielded different techniques that appeared to have nothing to do with her existence.

That scene felt familiar in Noah’s mind. He could see the solid stage woman deploying perfect counters to the dragons’ abilities, and the event felt quite reasonable even. After all, the rulers had fought those creatures for countless years already. They had all the time in the world to develop perfect items meant for those opponents.

The exchanges culminated in a sudden stabilization of the area. Noah saw the cracks closing before being unable to stare at the battle properly anymore. Yet, massive black spots materialized inside the storms around the lands and covered the entire hurricane as soon as the battlefield high in the sky became unclear.

The cultivators and c.o.c.kroaches couldn’t do anything to stop that process. The black masses inside the storms detonated and accelerated the raging winds that shot out of the explosions. The entire area fell into pure chaos in less than an instant, and Noah didn’t even have the time to speak before chaotic laws reached him and threatened to pierce his face.

However, that gale ended up piercing his figure without inflicting any damage. His body had become ethereal, and he quickly noticed that his companions were going through the same event.
