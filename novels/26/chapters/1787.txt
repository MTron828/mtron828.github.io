Chapter 1788 - 1788. Tactics

The scene created by the broken planet was spectacular. The structure was massive and floated behind the powerful white membrane that isolated it in a relatively small separate dimension.

Its giant boulders were as big as small regions, but they vanished as soon as they touched the light. The membrane even radiated a relatively intense pulling force, but the broken world fought against that power. The experts on the scene could sense its faint d.e.s.i.r.e to live.

Noah and King Elbas had devised a few plans after their inspections, but most of them relied on guesses generated after studying some of the main features of that environment.

They knew that the separate dimensions hidden inside the void had worlds and that some of them were suitable targets. They were also aware of the nature of the white layers that isolated those structures. However, they could plan the actual theft only after finding a suitable plane since they had to adapt to its condition.

A white layer with power that approached the ninth rank isolated the broken world from the other separate dimensions. Moreover, the light seemed able to teleport its matter instantly. Pulling it outside appeared quite troublesome. It was safer to send someone inside to steal the target.

"Come on," Noah said in a firm tone. "Let’s divide ourselves as we planned."

The fact that the experts had to adapt to the different situations of their targets didn’t mean that they had approached the mission unprepared. King Elbas had created plans for many hypothetical conditions, and the others had memorized them before leaving the black landmass.

Divine Demon, Sword Saint, Alexander, and Noah stepped forward and waited for their companions to make their move. King Elbas took out countless scanners and inscribed items as Robert, Steven, Elsie, and the three solid stage cultivators flew in front of the membrane and raised their hands to launch powerful abilities.

The membrane tried to resist their offensive, but its light slowly vanished as the many powerful abilities continued to ravage its fabric. Heaven and Earth didn’t create that white layer to defend their targets from external attacks, so piercing it ended up being easier than expected.

A hole opened in the membrane, and Robert’s team immediately deployed different abilities to keep its edges open. They did their best to avoid spreading more destruction, and Noah’s group didn’t hesitate to enter the separate dimension.

Noah had assigned specific roles before the mission, and he had even created teams with specific assignments that depended on the talents of their members.

Divine Demon, Sword Saint, Alexander, and Noah were the best among the group when facing unknown threats. Their sheer power and adaptability made them perfect for those moments since their chances to survive dangers were extremely high.

Meanwhile, King Elbas was the expert among the group who had the highest chance of finding out a method to bring the explorers out if something went wrong. He had to remain outside of the dangerous environments to remain able to complete his role.

The other experts had various useful talents, but they wouldn’t shine in that situation, so they limited themselves to open a path through the white layer.

Wilfred and the Foolery remained next to King Elbas. Their task was to protect the expert and his inscribed items due to their importance to the mission.

Instead, the army of magical beasts didn’t have any special role. They were the brute force of the group, and their task consisted of going all-out when the situation required it.

Some of their innate abilities might turn out to be useful, but the team didn’t want to rely on them too much due to the obvious issue in controlling those creatures. After all, they were hunting targets that could benefit the black landmass as a whole. They didn’t want to put upper tier beings in front of those massive sources of power.

A strange sensation hit the four experts that entered the separate dimension. Their centers of power grew heavy, and cracks spread around them whenever they tried to fight that suppression.

Noah soon understood that the issue wasn’t with his centers of power or any external force. The rules of the world were simply different in that environment. Divine existences shouldn’t be there, and the laws that ruled that place knew that.

The suppression didn’t hinder the team’s power. The experts only had to be careful of preserving the integrity of the separate dimension since they feared what could happen if the white layer completely crumbled.

That was the exact reason why Robert and the others didn’t completely break the membrane. Alerting Heaven and Earth was only a secondary concern. Their main worry concerned the chain reaction that the destruction of one of the separate dimensions could cause.

Heaven and Earth had hidden the worlds connected to their system in many separate dimensions inside the void. Some of them even occupied the same separate space and hinted at a lingering connection among all of them.

The destruction of the white layer would force the world contained inside the separate dimension out. It would end in the void or in separate spaces that held other similar structures, and its influence would inevitably affect the whole system.

The best outcome to that situation that the group could think of saw the world appearing in the void and orbiting around the white sky. Still, that was only one of the many possibilities, and it considered only the damage to the actual system. It didn’t say anything about Heaven and Earth’s reaction.

Being careful was mandatory in the mission, especially since the group wanted to avoid triggering a massive reaction from the rulers. Caesar had told them that Heaven and Earth would act once an actual deed happened, but the group d.e.s.i.r.ed to limit those events until they gathered enough energy for their home.

Noah felt strange as he neared the broken world. His instincts couldn’t fail to sense the presence of a connection between the planet’s aura and his existence.

’Is this the world that has generated the Devils?’ Noah wondered while inspecting the aura radiated by those materials.

His instincts rarely got the wrong impression, and they didn’t disappoint Noah even in that situation. The broken planet was the source of the Devils that had afflicted the other side of the Immortal Lands, but its current state was pitiful. Even its immense anger had dispersed after the long destruction.

The world seemed to notice Noah’s arrival, and unclear noises suddenly resounded from its surface. The broken planet wanted to talk, and its words sounded like pleas when they reached Noah’s mind. It wanted him to save its existence from Heaven and Earth’s light.

’It’s still alive,’ Noah concluded in his mind before accelerating toward the massive structure. ’It might benefit our home as a whole if the landmass gains some intelligence.’

Noah’s interest in the world intensified after he confirmed that it had retained traces of a will. His figure crossed the empty insides illuminated by the membrane and landed on the broken planet before spreading his consciousness.

The dense mental waves created cracks in the separate dimension and quickened the destruction of the world, but Noah managed to cover the entirety of the broken planet in a few seconds. He could feel its damages and d.e.s.i.r.es at that point, and his thoughts inevitably awakened Shafu from its rest. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

’Eat it up,’ Noah ordered while placing his hands on the barren surface, ’But don’t digest it.’

Shafu gave voice to a displeased cry inside his mind before activating one of its innate abilities. No pulling force came out of Noah’s figure, but the world under him suddenly disappeared anyway.
