Chapter 1139 1139. Methods

The new Warp spell wasn’t a proper teleport anymore, and it wasn’t as immediate as Noah’s movement technique. Yet, it allowed him to move undisturbed and unnoticed behind the enemy defenses.

Noah was inside the fourth fiendish figure. His corrosive smoke couldn’t expand inside the flames, but he had slashed with the Demonic Sword before the Royals could even start to restrict him.

The Royals didn’t have time to redirect their defenses. A large chunk of their flames disappeared before the golden shields around them fell into pieces.

Noah’s slash released a black line that crashed on their armors and created large cracks before the golden runes on their bodies stopped his attack once and for all. Even with the surprise effect, Noah didn’t manage to hurt the Royals.

Both First Prince and First Princess poured more blood in their flames to increase their density. Instead, Second Prince remained in a daze as the crystal at the center of his forehead shone.

A shadow came out of Noah’s slash. Second Prince suddenly awakened and retreated, but his brother and sister didn’t see that attack until it was too late.

First Prince saw a huge but strange figure for less than an instant before the golden runes on his body crumbled, and half of his torso separated from him.

That was a clean cut. First Prince didn’t even have time to react to the sudden assault, but he tried to ignite the blood coming out of his injury to cast a massive spell. Yet, no "Breath" gathered at his command. It took him a second to realize that his dantian was in the part that Night had cut away.

First Princess tried to recover the half torso, but the shadow reappeared, and she could finally make out its shape after the light of the flames shone on its figure.

The creature was similar to the Pterodactyls inside the Dark Gorge, but its lines appeared denser. Moreover, the pressure that it radiated didn’t belong to a simple beast in the sixth rank.

Her flames condensed around her body, but Second Prince intervened before the two could clash. A drop of blood flowed from his crystal, and a dense red light came out of it.

Night wanted to kill First Princess too, but it suddenly lost any control of its body. The beam had severed its head from the rest of the dark matter, turning it into nothing more than a floating triangle that leaked energy.

First Princess was livid. She amassed her dense flames to create a sphere ready to explode on the Pterodactyl’s head. Yet, danger filled the entirety of her mind as Noah appeared above her.

Noah didn’t have the fuming armor over him. The new flames had eventually defeated his spell, so he had to fly across First Princess’ snake without any protection.

Red spots formed on his skin as the flames burned him. Still, his eyes remained fixed on First Princess’ head.

Noah lifted the Demonic Sword that was still in the form of a small knife and pointed it at the Royal. He wielded it with two hands, and his arms slowly descended as they aimed for the laws that made her defenses.

Second Prince launched another red beam, but a large vortex and Snore appeared in its path. The Blood Companion used its statue form to weaken the attack, and the vortex absorbed the remaining energy of the blow.

Nothing came for Noah. His defenses had blocked the blow and had given him enough time to finish his attack.

First Princess could only stare in fear at the descending blade. The runes around her body exploded before a drop of blood fell from her forehead. Then, a black line divided her in half, and her consciousness went dark.

Noah didn’t show any happiness at that sight. He descended to retrieve First Princess’ dantian, and he moved toward First Prince’s center of power after he ate it.

"Don’t you dare!" First Prince sent threats with his consciousness, but Noah had already taken his dantian by that time. Night slowly floated back inside the space-ring as Noah ate that organ too.

First Prince felt fear. The flames still filled the environment, but Noah didn’t care. He let them burn his skin as he walked toward the Royal and grabbed his head.

"No-," First Prince tried to say something, but Noah applied some pressure and reduced the Royal’s head to a bloody pulp.

Two powerhouses had died in a few exchanges. They had survived Noah’s offensive multiple times only to die when they had given up on their favorable position.

They didn’t have any chance against Noah without an escape route or covers behind their backs.

The flames continued to burn Noah. The fire-resistant runes on his robe couldn’t do anything against that empowered fire. Yet, he didn’t leave them even after he finished the two powerhouses.

Second Prince saw Noah turning in his direction. Large red patches had appeared on his face, but the Royal didn’t dare to underestimate his opponent for even a second.

The two of them stared at each other for a few seconds before the Royal stepped back. His gesture was a clear statement that he had no intention to join that battle any further.

Noah kept on watching him while the flames around him dispersed. He then seized the space-rings from the two corpses and turned to fly toward the nearest amass of white light.

The truth was that he had depleted most of his darkness for that last offensive. His dantian was in a critical condition, but he had finally taken care of those keeping him away from King Elbas. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Now he could study the main battle and see if he could influence it.

King Elbas and Chasing Demon had continued to fight while Noah was busy dealing with the Royals.

Chasing Demon had returned on top of the titan that launched loud cries whenever King Elbas tried to cover the battlefield with flames.

The hole on the Demon’s waist continued to pour liquid "Breath" inside the divine item. Each second that he passed in that state worsened his condition, but the Royals’ leader had a hard time dealing with that new power.

The titan could finally show part of its true might now that Chasing Demon had given up on salvaging his centers of power. Hordes of smaller puppets came out of its body, and its movement appeared smoother.

King Elbas would generally rely on his sea of flames to destroy the army, but the titan shouted often, and its vibrations always made him waste many inscribed items.

The Royal had actually retreated since Chasing Demon had activated the secret art. The experts around him were even continuing with their offensive, so injuries eventually appeared on his body.

Great Elder Diana would always exploit the seconds right after the vibrations’ dispersion to launch precise lightning bolts at her opponent.

Instead, God’s Left Hand waved her fan continuously, and King Elbas always had to deal with her gales on top of escaping from the titan’s offensive.

Flying Demon and Dreaming Demon managed to slow him down from time to time. Their attacks weren’t as effective as their companions, but they created flaws in his defenses that the others exploited.

True Speed had joined his Matriarch after Elder Paul’s death, and he limited himself to launch his yellow lightning bolts.

That continuous offensive slowly exhausted King Elbas, who had already injured himself to land a blow on the titan. The situation appeared quite grim for him.
