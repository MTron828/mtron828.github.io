Chapter 1685 - 1685. Chance

The parasite’s corrosive aura fused with the singularity that shot out of the Demonic Sword. Rebecca couldn’t dodge the attack because Noah ensured that the Shadow Domain opened right on her face.

The straight singularity pierced Rebecca’s skin before reaching the defenses she had amassed in her insides. Noah’s attack couldn’t defeat those techniques on its own, but the corrosive aura allowed him to inflict more damage.

Rebecca’s face exploded, but she managed to preserve her mental sphere. Yet, the corrosive aura spread like a virus through her body and began to destroy her tissues.

The Shadow Domain crumbled after Noah pierced it with the singularity. The other three leaders immediately focused on him and released powerful abilities meant to kill him in one blow.

Night cut Castor’s left eye and severed a large chunk of his head. The expert was using his strange techniques to destabilize Noah’s figure, but the Pterodactyl interrupted the ability.

Snore appeared in front of Melissa and endured the entirety of her raging currents. The snake exploded into a sea of dense dark matter, but it healed in the next seconds.

Duanlong used its innate ability to change the trajectory of Robert’s attack, but the expert didn’t fall for the same trick. He had launched a needle-shaped purple mass that ignored the pulling force and hit Noah’s left shoulder.

Noah’s flames had never stopped burning the environment, but his body was too powerful to heal in those short minutes. He couldn’t find anything able to fix his charred flesh in the sky and ground, so a few injuries were still visible on his figure.

The needle-shaped mass pierced his skin and seeped inside his shoulder. The attack then released its toxic energy and tried to spread it inside Noah’s body.

The parasite’s corrosive aura damaged Noah’s flesh, but he didn’t care about that at the moment. Getting rid of Robert’s energy had the priority since he could always heal with his flame later.

A sense of weakness spread through Noah’s shoulder, even if his reaction had been quite immediate. Robert had succeeded in weakening his body, but Noah already had a counterattack ready.

Noah summoned the dark world and spat flames that fused with the dark matter and increased their power. The other cultivators deployed techniques to defeat the violent currents of dark matter, but Rebecca’s state didn’t allow her to fight properly.

Pieces of the dark world transformed into a stronger version of Noah’s innate ability and began to burn Rebecca. The expert still had many defenses inside her, but her skin couldn’t fight the overwhelming attack.

Rebecca burnt and gave her energy to Noah. His injuries healed in an instant, and his blade flashed right after. A curved singularity covered in corrosive aura crashed on the wounded expert and made a hole in her defenses.

Noah didn’t hesitate to point the blade toward the weak spot in her defenses, but the dark world suddenly sensed the arrival of a second cultivator. Robert had been the first to pierce through the dark matter and find a path toward Noah.

Robert raised his finger, and a purple whip followed. His weapon cut through the dark matter easily, and it threatened to reach Noah. However, the laws of space began to bend and delayed the arrival of the attack.

’It will hit me anyway,’ Noah thought without halting his attack.

His ability in bending space had improved after the period as a Devil, but Robert’s attacks could cut through Noah’s tricks. Even opening a portal to the void wouldn’t work due to his flexible purple substance.

Noah could avoid the whip, but that would cost him the chance to attack Rebecca. The expert’s condition was awful, and Noah didn’t want Heaven and Earth to undo his work.

The decision arrived immediately in his mind. Noah didn’t even bother to hesitate in that situation. He had the best body in the entire world. Enduring damage was what he had built himself to do.

The Demonic Sword covered by roots and dark matter landed on Rebecca’s c.h.e.s.t. That spot was the most damaged area on her body. Her defenses had finally revealed a flaw.

A piercing singularity came out of the Demonic Sword and created a large hole in her c.h.e.s.t. Moreover, the corrosive aura seeped into her tissues and began to expand through her body.

The Shadow Domain opened and filled Rebecca with Instabilities. Noah could see his spiked weapons and his flames materializing inside the hole and in the rest of her organs.

Then, the whip arrived. Robert cracked his weapon on Noah’s body. His skin remained in one piece, but large purple spots appeared on his side.

The black hole and the parasite attacked that toxic energy, but Robert had managed to deliver far more of his law at that time. The purple spots spread even after the suppression of Noah’s assets.

A sense of weakness filled Noah, but he didn’t forget to return inside the Shadow Domain and teleport away. Robert couldn’t find anything when he reached his position, and Rebecca’s explosion only increased his surprise.

Noah reappeared in a distant spot of the dark world. The damage inflicted to Rebecca’s insides through his flames sent energy to his body and helped fight the infection.

Robert’s substance had changed. It seemed to have a will now, and it even knew where to expand to hurt Noah.

’He can learn about his opponents during the infections!’ Noah exclaimed in his mind.

Robert had modified his purple substance. His attack seemed able to counter Noah’s innate defenses. Still, it couldn’t do anything against the dark matter and parasite, so pressure eventually fell on the poison.

Noah healed his injuries while inspecting the battlefield. Robert, Melissa, and Castor had freed themselves from the dark world and had returned under the white sky. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The white pillar didn’t need to heal them at that time, but it still sent energy to them. It seemed that the structure could even take care of the state of their centers of power.

Instead, Rebecca didn’t move. Her body had mostly disappeared after the explosions, and the dark world had never stopped sending Noah’s ambition toward her.

’Did I kill her?’ Noah wondered.

The dark world could provide information about Rebecca’s state in an instant. The expert had died, but Noah couldn’t feel certain about that after his experience with Otto.

’Sever her connection with Heaven and Earth while she isn’t under the sky,’ Noah ordered, and Night immediately disappeared inside her figure.

Meanwhile, the dark world began to create another army of six-armed dragons. Noah was ready to give his everything to keep the three cultivators outside of the dark world.

Noah finally had the chance to kill one of his opponents. That feat could open a path toward victory. His hopes to defeat four solid stage cultivators wouldn’t be too unreal anymore.

Still, Robert, Castor, and Melissa had learnt how Noah acted. They had even acknowledged his power. The fact that Rebecca didn’t come out of the dark world could only mean that Noah had defeated her, so she needed their help.

The three cultivators pointed their hands toward the black sea and released massive abilities. Wind, poison, and invisible destruction landed on Noah’s technique and made it crumble.

Noah had to teleport himself away to avoid that massive offensive. His army of dragons vanished in an instant, and Rebecca’s body completely crumbled.
