Noah focused on the rank 4 dragon in the lower tier, his consciousness enveloped its body and thoroughly analyzed it.

’It’s wounded, malnourished, and its mental state isn’t exactly optimal. Also, its rank is a bit off from what I need, it seems that I need to adjust it a bit before killing it.’

Noah thought as the Cursed dragon angrily roared toward him, it seemed really disappointed to have lost the chance to satisfy its s.e.x.u.a.l urges.

Yet, Noah’s focus was on the insides of his space-ring where the spirit automaton was preparing a series of potions and pills under Noah’s orders.

’First, let’s fix those scales.’

Noah’s eyes shone as the wings behind his back spread and a shockwave was released under his feet, the dragon pounced at him only to discover that he had completely disappeared.

Then, the dragon felt a burning sensation coming from its back, a dense substance was being spread on its body which seemed to affect the state of its scales.

The burning sensation came from the regenerative proprieties of its body which had been momentarily enhanced by the dense substance, the scales and the scars all over the body of the dragon began to heal at a fast pace, it took only a few minutes for it to be completely fixed.

’Now, malnourishment and rank.’

Noah thought as he floated in the air above the unaware dragon and analyzed its body.

He couldn’t use the Cursed dragon for the fusion just yet, he needed to bring it to an optimal state before it could become a material that reached his standards.

Noah dove toward the dragon, a pill was in his hands as he fixed his focus on the mouth of the creature.

The dragon was confused, it was used to live in the darkness but even its sight was affected there, it could only understand Noah’s position due to his smell and presence which weren’t that reliable.

That allowed Noah to suddenly appear in front of it and throw the pill directly inside its mouth, the pill immediately melted when it touched the saliva of the dragon, releasing many nourishing substances that were absorbed by its body.

The dragon felt a surge of strength starting from its mouth and filling its body, its atrophied muscles began to swell under the effects of Noah’s pill, the dragon was slowly returning to its peak form!

Noah knew that it would have been impossible to find a specimen that matched his standards even before he decided to explore the Granite Abyss, he considered himself lucky enough that the Cursed dragon species was still alive after all.

That’s why he had sorted the necessary resources for the task before reaching the canyon, the knowledge of the spirit automaton of his ring had been of incredible help when he selected the drugs that would have had the best effects on magical beasts.

Of course, Noah was using rank 4 drugs.

It took a while for the dragon to reach its peak state, Noah had returned in his position above it while the body of the beast absorbed the nutrients.

’After its state is fixed, its mind should resume working properly.’

Noah thought as he waited for the dragon’s next move.

The beast had its head lowered, Noah guessed that it was probably bathing in the feeling of returning to its peak after who knows how much time.

Then, it abruptly raised its head and released a gray ray made of flames that aimed for Noah!

Noah was a bit surprised by that sudden action but he soon became relieved.

Heilong’s wings swung right before Noah turned ethereal and was enveloped by the gray flames, he didn’t feel any pain at that time which allowed him to focus solely on the nature of the attack.

’It seems that its flames aren’t at the same level as the rank 5 creature, there isn’t enough light for both of them. Yet, it has recovered its mental state at least.’

Noah thought as the attack ended and he returned material, interrupting his falling motion.

The Cursed dragon had immediately attacked Noah as soon as its strength was restored, it seemed that its senses were now able to pinpoint his position.

Yet, when it understood that its attack didn’t have any effect, it began to retreat, it had realized that its enemy was too strong.

Noah dove again in its direction as he heaved a sigh of relief, the beast had recovered its survival instincts after its body had been restored.

’One leg should be enough.’

Noah evaluated as the huge leg of a rank 4 dragon at the peak of the middle tier appeared in his hands, he then threw it on the escaping dragon’s path before flying higher in the air.

The Cursed dragon stopped its tracks when that appealing food appeared in front of it, it quickly analyzed its surrounding before seizing the leg with its fangs and retreating in its cavity.

Then, Noah waited.

His consciousness never left the insides of the cavity, he saw how the Cursed dragon ate the body parts that came from his stash of dragon’s corpses and absorbed the "Breath" that it contained.

As that "Breath" was absorbed, the power of the dragon increased, reaching the peak of the lower tier.

It was at that point that Noah landed on the bottom of the gorge and entered the cavity where his prey was eating.

Part of the leg had yet to be eaten but the dragon couldn’t focus on it, its gaze went on the small intruder that was slowly walking toward it.

’Who knows for how long it has lived in this place... Well, its species is done for anyway.’

Noah thought as he analyzed the cavity. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

It wasn’t even fifteen meters wide, the Cursed dragon could barely fit inside it.

The dragon was about to roar at him but a sudden feeling of weakness enveloped its body as four black lines formed a rectangle around its figure.

The Cursed dragon felt as if it was about to faint due to the effects of Noah’s spell but it couldn’t even move before a series of sharp claws stabbed specific spots inside its body.

It had just recovered its strength and even reached the peak of the tier but it couldn’t do anything against the human that was walking toward it.

It died quickly, Noah had become too used to kill rank 4 beasts with the Ghostly claws spell during his experiments, not even a drop of blood was spilled on the ground as he stored its corpse inside his space-ring.
