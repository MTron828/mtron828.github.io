Chapter 1067 1067. Grin

Noah’s battle prowess had reached the sixth rank even if his dantian was in the previous rank’s solid stage. His body gave him immense strength, and it elevated all his abilities to an unthinkable level for the state of his centers of power.

His only weakness was that he had yet to go into seclusion to tune his attacks to the new power he acquired. Still, that wasn’t entirely his fault.

Noah had learnt about June’s condition right after coming out of the chrysalis. Then, he discovered that there were rebels in the other world when he found her.

He had to take care of the rebellion to save the dimensional tunnel, and the Council traded the Divine Cut for the Kesier Apes once he returned to the main world.

The enlightenment obtained with the Cut’s aura had kept him fully occupied for years, which stopped the projects he had started in the previous free months.

Noah didn’t even have the time to seize that Divine Inheritance since the time to start the assault on the Elbas family’s domain had arrived.

In total, Noah had piled less than a year of actual training and seclusion, which was unthinkable for an entity on his level. The only reason he could express his current prowess was that the Divine Cut had pushed his individuality toward his sharpness.

It was as if Noah had been through a polishing process that had taken out his strongest self. Still, there was a limit to how much power he could express due to the lack of training.

However, his mind worked at an incredible speed when he was under pressure, or the situation required it. Noah had developed the movement technique in a matter of months, and most of the slashes performed during the assault on the Royal Academy were attacks that he had never tested.

The same had happened at that moment. Noah had found himself stuck in a situation that required him to express more power, and his body had activated all his mental methods to create a technique that suited him.

Of course, even his fantastic body had its limits. Noah needed to own the necessary power and expertise already for something on that level to be born. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

First Prince’s arrogant smile froze when he saw his left arm floating away from him together with the golden light that Noah had severed. Fear filled his mind as he thought about what would have happened if the defensive ability didn’t have enough "Breath" to deflect that blow.

The truth was that the golden light had focused everything on restricting Noah, which meant that most of its "Breath" was between him and the Royal. That density of that energy had been enough to make Noah’s slash deviate from its original trajectory and cut First Prince’s arm instead of his head.

"This is not possible," First Prince said slowly. His words resembled a mumbling proper of a researcher witnessing something that defied the laws of the world.

The golden light came from a defensive item that had power at the peak of the gaseous stage of the sixth rank when it focused its energy on one spot. The "Breath" covered an entire side, so the defensive item didn’t reach its peak. Yet, it was still a shield that no newly advanced powerhouse could pierce!

A human-shaped crack replaced Noah’s figure right before Second Princess’ snake engulfed that area. Her fire dispersed the starry sky and corrosive smoke but left First Prince unaffected. His sister’s spell didn’t hurt him.

Noah reappeared behind Second Princess, but the sensors had warned her about his arrival. A golden light shone around her too and blocked his punch, locking him in the same situation as before.

Second Princess didn’t stop there. She had seen what Noah was capable of, so she didn’t limit her defenses to that inscribed item. Wounds opened on her wrists, and blood flowed inside the light to empower its radiance.

Noah executed his new cut again, and the laws in front of him separated. However, his slash found a denser layer of laws once it crashed on the golden light. A curse echoed in his mind when he saw that his new attack wasn’t able to pierce the shield.

His Divine Deduction technique activated again as his body pushed his mental capabilities to their limits to solve that issue. Yet, Noah didn’t find anything in those fractions of instants.

A conclusion became evident in his mind. His power wasn’t enough to pierce that defense.

Second Princess revealed a smile at that sight, but her expression froze when she saw the fiendish figure doing the same. A wave of coldness filled her body as Noah sprinted backward to fly in the direction of the massive crack that the sky was still struggling to close.

The pulling force became stronger as Noah dragged Second Princess and her defensive item toward the crack. His speed increased, and the Royal couldn’t help but shout when she saw how reckless her opponent was. "You are going to kill both of us!"

Noah didn’t answer. Black smoke continued to come out of his spiked armor, which blocked any available path toward them. First Prince wanted to help her sister, but he had a hard time catching up with them.

The fissure grew closer in Second Princess’ eyes. She had to do something to stop her opponent, but the golden light didn’t allow her to express her full power.

Nevertheless, lowering her defenses would expose her to Noah. She was in a pickle, and no approach left her unharmed.

Initially, she tried to test Noah’s recklessness. She didn’t believe that he would charge right into the void to kill her. Yet, the fiendish figure kept on looking at her with an evil grin, and his speed only increased as they neared the fissure.

When they were about to reach the crack, she understood that Noah’s threats weren’t void. Multiple cuts appeared on her body, and blood covered her skin before she recalled the golden light. Then, her figure exploded into a fiery nova.

Noah slashed as soon as he saw her defenses disappearing, but dense flames quickly pushed him away while dispersing his Demonic Form. A human-shaped crack replaced his figure right before he entered the fissure, and he reappeared above the sky to analyze the state of the battlefield.

First Prince had just opened a path through the corrosive smoke when the flames destroyed every trace of it. A concerned expression appeared on his face when he saw that fire, but he relaxed after a bloodied figure appeared near him.

Noah almost didn’t recognize Second Princess. What had appeared next to First Prince was a cultivator without any skin and missing the right part of her lower body.

The last clash had left her badly injured, but she stood next to her brother as if nothing had happened. Even if she was only a cultivator, the resilience of a powerhouse was incredible.
