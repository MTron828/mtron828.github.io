Chapter 1724 - 1724. Sides

The giant lightning bolt transformed into a mass of dense raging energy that took the shape of a large sphere. The attack lost its momentum and began to float among the sky. Flares shot out of it from time to time, and the air suffered from its destructive power.

A wave of darkness came out of Noah’s figure and enveloped the crackling mass of power. He absorbed that energy in an instant, and the area went silent as he waited for something to happen.

"What was that?" A familiar voice came out of the castle, and Noah couldn’t help but smile when he heard it.

"Maybe stop attacking me so I can tell you what happened on the other side of the Immortal Lands," Noah shouted.

A silent second went by before the window at the top of the castle opened. Noah didn’t hesitate to teleport there, and a large training area unfolded in his vision.

The size of the training area didn’t reflect the top of the castle. The room in Noah’s vision was far larger than the overall structure, and his expertise allowed him to understand that the inscriptions on the dark walls messed with the laws of space.

’Second Prince has definitely improved in these years,’ Noah thought before his gaze focused on a familiar figure on the other side of the training area.

June had her back on the wall as she sat cross-legged on the ground. Black sparks that released an orange glow surrounded her figure and revealed her cultivation level. She was at the peak of the gaseous stage, but the energy around her was condensing and improving.

"You have been away for a really long time," June snorted. "I guess a millennium or two are nothing for us at this point."

"I had to deal with Heaven and Earth in the end," Noah replied while wearing a smile. "They sent us near the sky. I think I’ve touched it for an instant."

The revelation left June speechless. Her curiosity took over her annoyance and forced her to question Noah about that matter.

Noah gladly told her everything. He went from the Space Hounds inside the dimensional tunnel to the battle among the whiteness. June still lacked some key features about that knowledge, but he made sure to fill all the blank spots.

"Did you really talk with Earth while in the sky?" June asked while lying on Noah’s l.a.p.

The duo had already moved past the previous scuffle. They knew how to handle the separations far too well to let the recent events affect their relationship.

"I had to learn as much as possible," Noah explained. "It’s impossible to get a meeting with the rulers unless I do something crazy. I had to seize that chance."

"You always do something crazy," June snorted.

"There is crazy and crazy crazy," Noah announced. "Talking while I’m dealing with light and crackling creatures is normal."

June couldn’t help but laugh at those words. Noah had survived another incredible struggle, and she felt truly happy for him. Her only regret was that she didn’t have the chance to fight next to him.

"You seem happy," June eventually whispered when she inspected Noah’s facial features. "Did you think about something to prolong the Devils’ power?"

"It’s rare for you to misunderstand what goes through my mind," Noah laughed while c.a.r.e.s.sing June’s hair. "I’m just glad that you are catching up. I was afraid you would have remained behind."

June’s eyes widened at those words, and their conversation ended. The two silently decided to make up for the years spent on different sides of the Immortal Lands.

The news about the return of Noah’s group spread quickly. Even June had been aware of his arrival before he actually reached the blue regions.

Mental messages containing different images that confirmed the return of the experts spread through the Legion’s domain and informed every relevant character inside the organization.

The Demons, Second Prince, Daniel, Faith, Jordan, Ian, and even Alexander decided to organize an event that would bring the entire Legion together.

No one cared about the differences between Noah’s organization and the actual Legion. The experts only wanted an excuse to celebrate, catch up, and plan their next move.

The news about the celebration arrived while June and Noah were still inside the castle. They didn’t even notice those mental messages, but their companions took care of that matter.

Regrouping was a significant aspect of their return. The celebration would allow every expert to gain knowledge of two sides of the Immortal Lands. Even the members of enemy organizations would join that conversation if they had the chance.

Noah and June came out of the castle after sharing some other information about their last years.

Noah learnt that June had managed to gain that sharp increase of power due to the countless battles engaged by the Legion. She had chosen to lead many platoons in different areas and destroy the other organizations’ hopes of recreating the human domain.

June didn’t stop there. She had also fought every pack of magical beasts in the area. She had tried to approach those creatures on her own most of the time. Still, the Legion’s army had always been behind her.

The many years spent fighting non-stop had forced her existence to improve. June had finally experienced a glimpse of an endless battlefield, and her law had benefited greatly from the event.

Her cultivation level had even gained a lot when Second Prince was busy placing the defenses around the new domain of the Legion. June had to keep magical beasts and cultivators away while the expert built the formations, which involved another wave of long battles.

"I told you that everything comes to life whenever you are around," June commented when Luke informed them that the Legion had planned a meeting. "I have been in this castle for centuries without seeing the slightest trace of an enemy. The Legion didn’t even try to make events to appease my boredom. Yet, everything starts to move as soon as you come back."

"It’s not like we’ll separate again," Noah commented. "Your cultivation level isn’t a hindrance anymore. You can follow me in every mission." Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

"I’ll rely on your ability to cause chaos wherever you go," June smirked.

The duo followed Luke outside the castle, where King Elbas and the others were waiting for them. The group had even managed to summon the evolved Foolery, and they didn’t forget to call the experts who had come from the other side of the Immortal Lands.

"The meeting is in a few months," King Elbas explained. "We should depart right away."

"Shouldn’t we leave someone to defend the borders?" Noah asked.

"No, please, let them come," June almost begged. "I’ve tried to leave openings in our defenses on purpose, but no one wants to move. I don’t know what those cowards are doing in the Outer Lands, but they have no intention to return."

Noah found the whole matter strange, and his gaze promptly fell on Luke. The latter nodded when he understood the hidden meaning in that gesture. The human organizations would never accept to live in the Outer Lands unless they had a few benefits, which usually meant Heaven and Earth.

"I have already sent baits toward different cells of the secret organization," Luke explained. "We’ll know more once someone decides to talk."

"Do you think they will?" Noah asked.

"Our organization counts more than thirty rank 8 cultivators," Luke explained. "Moreover, we have some of the best experts who have ever stepped on the Immortal Lands. I bet that everyone is dying for a chance to switch sides."
