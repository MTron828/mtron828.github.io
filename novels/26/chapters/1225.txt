Chapter 1226 1226. Ambition

Great Elder Diana wanted to say something else, but Shandal disappeared before she could make any sound. He had decided that the negotiations were over, so the powerhouses could only accept that outcome.

Noah was satisfied with that result. Shandal wouldn’t affect the battles against the peak rank 6 Eternal Snakes, so he could use his influence to assign more hunts to the Hive.

The egg was tempting, and its aura still lingered inside his mind. Yet, that was the resource of a divine cultivator, so he couldn’t hope to seize it.

Noah would be lying if he said that he didn’t think about stealing the egg. Still, he knew his limits, so that idea never managed to go past the back of his head.

Noah had even obtained a new piece of information concerning the Immortal Lands. He now knew that divine beings could give birth to other creatures in the divine ranks. That changed everything in his idea of the fauna up there.

He had already guessed that there wouldn’t be any creature in the human ranks up there. Still, he was now sure that there would be far more divine beings than he had predicted in the Immortal Lands.

As for the crack, the group could only trust Shandal. The survival of human society depended on his task.

Noah stood up too after Shandal left. Great Elder Diana and God’s Left Hand shot confused gazes at him, but he had other pressing matters in his mind.

The leaders wanted to organize a plan to deal with the ten peak rank 6 beasts, but Noah had his instincts to satisfy before. He also felt a battle intent surging from the bottom of his mind.

Noah didn’t want to work together with the other organizations just yet. Opponents that could endure his strength had appeared, and he couldn’t wait to test himself.

The battles against Second Prince and the puppets had forced Noah to reveal part of his power, but he had never felt fully satisfied there.

The Royal was weaker than him, and he relied on its peculiar existence and superior expertise in the inscription field to last against Noah.

The puppets weren’t living beings. They were defenses created to be annoying and hard to deal with. Noah didn’t have the time and space to express his prowess in those battles.

Noah desired to fight an opponent that could force him to go all-out, and a few contenders had just fallen from the sky. He couldn’t contain himself anymore. He had to seize that chance.

"Let’s see how the situation evolves," Noah said. "The beasts will follow the aura of the egg, so they will probably search the entirety of the new continent to retrieve it. Our organizations didn’t build much. We can let these creatures hurt the Elbas family for us."

Noah’s words made sense. The three organizations had returned to the surface less than twenty years ago. All their buildings and defenses were only temporary structures created to last while the invasion continued.

Abandoning wasn’t a problem, and they could exploit the destruction created by the Snakes to damage the Elbas family and its domain.

Noah was sure that the Snakes would converge in the new continent. The trace left by the egg had disappeared together with Shandal, so the beasts would think that their target would be in the landmass.

God’s Left Hand quickly agreed with Noah’s idea, and even Great Elder Diana felt inclined to study the situation for a while before deciding on an approach. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

However, the leaders couldn’t help but question Noah when they saw him setting off in the direction of one of the Eternal Snakes.

"We didn’t decide any plan," Noah said as he shrugged his shoulders. "You can behave as you wish. I’ll do the same."

After those words, Noah ignored any other complaint and flew toward the nearest Eternal Snake. He didn’t even inform his companions about his destination. There was only the imminent battle in his mind.

Shandal had returned while the group was fighting with the Hydra, and Noah had barely used any energy. He was virtually at his peak.

Noah flew through the sky. His aura became sharper as he sensed the mighty opponent in the distance. His cultivation level also surged as his ambitions pushed his centers of power beyond their normal limits.

A creature at the peak of the sixth rank was stronger than him. Noah wasn’t so delusional to think that he could defeat existences at the heroic ranks’ apex.

However, the Eternal Snakes were magical beasts, the weakest type of creatures in the world. They stood under humans and hybrids, but Noah surpassed all three of them when it came to sheer potential.

With his ambition leading him to the quasi-solid stage, Noah believed that he could put up a fight against those Snakes. He even guessed that he could land a few blows if he could exploit the species’ flaws.

Noah flew higher in the air when he sensed that his opponent was nearby. His vertical pupils shrunk when he laid his eyes on the massive Snake that had fallen from the Immortal Lands, and his instincts began to scream again.

The Eternal snake was immense. It was longer than Snore, and it had dark-green scales that appeared indestructible.

The creature had four arms with three giant claws each. A pair grew near the head, while the other was at the center of its body. The limbs were quite short compared to its size, but they appeared quite threatening nonetheless.

Noah didn’t feel only danger when he looked at the creature. His hunger had also surged again, and he soon understood why his instincts had acted in that way.

Creatures on that level wouldn’t normally give birth to those reactions inside him. It was as if anything coming from the Immortal Lands could awaken his most profound and most primal instincts.

Noah soon understood the reason behind his intense sensations. The Eternal Snake didn’t seem different from any other magical beast initially, but some of its peculiarities became obvious as the analysis continued.

The scales of snake-like and dragon-like creatures would always gain metallic properties after the specimens became strong enough. It was a simple matter of evolution. The skin of a beast became sturdier as its power increased.

However, the Eternal Snake’s skin appeared even sturdier than what Noah had predicted. He had never thought that materials in the heroic ranks could give off such a powerful aura, but he found the reason behind that feature immediately.

That magical beast lived in the Immortal Lands. Its meals consisted of other creatures and "Breath" coming from the higher plane.

With such top-tier nutrients, the body of the Snake had reached the peak. The creature was the best possible version of a specimen at the peak of the sixth rank. Even species with better innate gifts would be inferior to that beast unless they grew in the same environment.

’It is bordering the quasi-rank 7 in terms of power,’ Noah evaluated, and his ambition became even more intense at that sight.

Seeing the higher world’s effects on a simple magical beast made him desire to ascend even more. He desired that environment since it was the best training area in all the planes as far as he knew.

The desire to make the Immortal Lands his territory increased and his ambition continued to make his cultivation level grow under that wave of greed and impatience.

It didn’t take much before Noah’s ambition made him break through the solid stage.
