The crowd was silenced by Noah’s statement but was then revived by Manuel’s words.

"The best house in the academy belongs to the strongest student. If you want it, you have to defeat me."

The crowd exploded in cheers, Manuel’s demeanor seemed to be more appreciated than Noah’s one.

One was prideful and confident while the other was cold and indifferent, there was no doubt about who would attract the favor of the students.

Noah shook his head and wielded his sabers.

"Let’s just start, I have things to do."

A wave of coldness enveloped the stage as Noah focused on his opponent.

Manuel’s expression changed instantly, his smiling face transformed into a stern one.

Noah’s stare seemed to pierce him physically and the pressure it caused was suffocating.

’His battle intent sure is worth of praise.’

Manuel thought, mistaking the pressure of Noah’s sea of consciousness for his battle might.

It wasn’t to blame though, the possibility that the youth in front of him was a rank 2 mage was unthinkable.

’He is not bad, he is able to withstand my focus. Well, I stayed in the forest for one week to learn how to hold back after all.’

That wasn’t the full extent of the mental pressure he was capable of, he was restraining himself.

Manuel decided to take the battle seriously and pointed his sword at Noah.

Sparks gathered on the metal of the blade and the handle lighted up to accelerate the process.

In less than a second, a thunderbolt shot out from the tip of the sword toward Noah.

Echo appeared in the air in front of him with its wings spread wide.

The thunder hit its body and pierced it, continuing on its way to hit the wall behind the blood companion.

Noah had already moved, the moment he understood that Manuel was a cultivator of the thunder element, he knew that Echo could not completely block the blow.

He had a vast experience regarding thunder spells due to his two years of weekly sparring with June, he knew that the bat’s body was not enough as a form of protection.

Echo disappeared in his body as Noah ran, he wanted to get closer to Manuel in order to force a melee battle.

However, another bolt of lightning arrived in his direction and he was forced to stop his advance and hide behind Echo.

Manuel didn’t stop though, he launched two more thunderbolts in his direction, making Noah retreat.

’It’s his weapon!’

Noah was confused.

Generally speaking, it would be impossible to use such a powerful spell that many times in a row and without a certain delay.

Yet, Manuel did exactly that and Noah pointed the reason for that unusual ability to his weapon.

’That sword shortens the casting time of the spell and it seems to lower the mental energy required for its activation. Its definitely a rank 1 item at the peak of the tier.’

As Noah retreated, Manuel stopped using his spell and took out a bottle from his space-ring in order to restore some of his mental energy.

Pills and items were allowed in those kinds of battle, wealth was a form of power after all.

The only rule was to not attempt on the life of your opponent.

’This is getting annoying, I should try that thing.’

Echo’s wings came out of his back and Noah shot in a straight line toward Manuel.

His opponent didn’t hesitate and pointed his blade back at him. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Another thunderbolt shot in his direction but Noah didn’t change his pace.

As he and the spell were at less than a meter from each other, a black ring appeared under his feet and he immediately shot in the air.

He flew over the spell!

Manuel, however, knew about his wings and promptly moved his blade to aim in his position mid-air.

Little did he expect that, as soon as the spell shot out from his weapon, Noah kicked the air over him and diagonally changed his direction.

Normally, when someone jumped during a battle, he was unable to dodge.

Noah had his wings but they weren’t enough to change his course so drastically.

Even when he used the Shadow steps spell, the concentration required to make those kinds of cuts in the air was high and the results were not always reliable.

However, since he became a rank 2 mage, he finally managed to perfect that combat style.

Noah’s cut speed scared Manuel that hastily released another spell.

Noah didn’t even look at it and changed direction again, relentlessly moving closer to his opponent.

That was proper flight, not simply floating in the air!

As for how he could manage to understand the trajectory of the spells, that was also due to his rank 2 mental sphere.

Each one of Manuel’s actions was under the strict control of his personal scan ability which had surpassed Echo’s one in precision when it concerned a short distance.

When he was in the air, Noah was untouchable.

Manuel gave up on trying to hit him and prepared to drink another potion but Noah launched thirty wind slashes toward his position.

The slashes came from different directions as if there were more persons attacking him at the same time.

Manuel gave up on refilling his mental sphere too and unleashed the might of his rank 4 martial art to block all the attacks.

His sword moved slowly in the air in front of him, releasing small sparks.

As the black slashes arrived in his position, the sparks exploded and instantly destroyed Noah’s attacks.

However, that action gave Noah enough time to arrive in his opponent’s position.

’First form of the Ashura!’

He didn’t hesitate and unleashed his strongest technique.

More than fifteen sabers appeared around Manuel and attacked him at the same time!

Manuel resorted again to the shield made of sparks to defend himself.

Another explosion occurred which distanced the two students from each other.

"You are indeed strong."

Manuel spoke with a slight smile on his face.

"But my reserves of "Breath" are deeper than yours, this match is mine."

Noah didn’t answer and simply pointed at his right cheek.

Manuel didn’t understand the meaning of that gesture until he felt a warm sensation on the left side of his face.

He swiped his cheek with his hand and found out that a small cut had appeared on it.
