Noah knew the answer to his question but he felt that he was still missing the main detail behind that reason.

’The Elemental forging method is strong but it is just another inscription method...’

Divine Demon didn’t speak at that time, he calmly waited for Noah to finish his mind process.

’Maximum expression of the Attunement method he says... The theory behind that method is to understand and copy the meanings contained in the "Breath" so it can’t emulate the meanings set by cultivators. Wait, did he mean that the Attunement method can’t go past the heroic ranks?’

Noah raised his gaze when he reached that point in his thinking, he looked Divine Demon in the eyes, waiting for further explanations.

"That’s not exactly correct. The method isn’t flawed in its form but Heaven and Earth would never let anyone hear ways to reach the divine ranks. In my long life, only one being was able to reach godhood with a cultivation technique created with such a method. You have heard of him, I’m talking about the God of the Shandal Empire."

Divine Demon revealed with a smile, the surprise felt by Noah had long surpassed what his face was able to hide, his mouth was open in amazement when that information entered his mind.

"So, there is a way around it!"

Noah exclaimed but his phrase was met by a loud snort.

"What’s the point of reaching godhood if the path ahead is blocked? Will you ever be satisfied in forever being the weakest God?"

Some pressure was released by the mighty being’s will as he spoke, Noah could only honestly shake his head in answer, he knew that he would never pursue a flawed training method like that.

"The Attunement method leads to a dead-end, it is how Heaven and Earth forbid the paths to true divinity. Only an entity who has created its personal road can hope to reach the realms after the seventh rank!"

Divine Demon lifted his head toward the sky, his hair fluttered as a dense aura was exuded from his body.

Ambition!

Pure ambition!

His figure reflected in Noah’s eyes seemed to take the place of one of the stars in his imaginary sky, Noah suddenly realized that he was looking at the will of one of the stars that he wanted to reach.

"Please, teach me."

Noah bowed as he said those words, the emotion behind that gestures were real, he was asking for the guidance of a God after all!

"Sure, but let me ask you something first. Why do you think you are here while the others that have managed to defeat their copies are still in the mountain range?"

That piece of information was revealed to the unknowing Noah, he was speechless when he heard that.

’So, I wasn’t the first.’

Divine Demon pointed his hand toward Noah as he answered his thoughts.

"You weren’t the first, nor the strongest. The reason why I’ve chosen you is that you are the only one who has created a technique. The Shadow sprint martial art was your ticket to this place."

Noah’s eyes widened but he chose to remain silent, there was too much that he didn’t understand.

"Currently, you have three spells that can accompany you through the entirety of your journey: The Demonic form which bases most of its power on the Kesier runes inside your mind; The Body-inscription spell which needs a magical beast of a matching rank; The Warp spell which needs for your mental energy to see the place where you want to teleport. As you can see, all spells without a rank have restrictions, it is hard to create something that can last till the divine ranks."

Divine Demon took a step forward, he walked on the air as he closed toward Noah.

"However, you were able to modify a rank 0 spell and transform it into a rank 4 martial art through your inscription method. This proves that you can walk the path to godhood."

The middle-aged man landed in front of Noah and pointed a finger toward his mind as he spoke.

"The sea of consciousness is easy, the Kesier runes already are a sort of defiance against Heaven and Earth but keeping the "Breath" inside it works too."

His finger then pointed at his low-waist, where the dantian was.

"Dark vortex cultivation technique enhanced with the Dantian’s opening. I suggest you create a personal technique before breaking through the heroic ranks to maximize your individuality."

In the end, he placed his hand on Noah’s shoulder.

"Sadly, your body is already in the heroic ranks but it’s not too late. Always remember that you must pursue individuality, your Yin body is not your body, it’s just a training method invented by someone in the past, it will never suit you as well as something you create."

Divine Demon let go of Noah and crossed his arms as he stood in front of him.

"The difference in power between the cultivators in the heroic ranks is found in the amount of individuality that they can express through their cultivation techniques and spells. Ideally speaking, a cultivator able to enter the heroic ranks with all its centers of power thanks to techniques of its creation will be the strongest heroic cultivator ever, but I know that such a feat is almost impossible. Yet, your situation is just one step away from that."

Noah finally understood.

The academy had already taught him that cultivation techniques of different sources won’t produce the best results but he had never thought that there would also be a sensible difference in power if one pursued that method.

"Your ancestor chose to go on his way and created a cultivation technique only after he reached the fifth rank. He was already a messy entity at that point, his centers of power couldn’t express his true essence which is why his cultivation was slowed."

"Are you implying that I should stop searching for cultivation techniques and body-nourishing methods in the heroic ranks and create them myself? How? My level is simply too low!" Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Noah complained, he would have already created them if he had the needed ability.

Divine Demon smiled when he heard those words, he knew that Noah had finally understood the true path.

"It’s time to receive your Inheritance then."

Noah was stunned when he heard those words, he could only watch as Divine Demon raised his hand again and placed a finger between Noah’s eyebrows.

An incredible pain hit his mind as inscriptions appeared on the walls of his mental sphere.
