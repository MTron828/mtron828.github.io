Chapter 1712 - 1712. Path

Divine Demon’s laws began to affect the environment, but the expert soon understood that nothing in his arsenal would work against that threat. The world didn’t know how to help him. The situation was utterly desperate, and his imagination ended up hitting a wall.

Noah had forced the expert to realize Heaven and Earth’s challenge. Overcoming it was mandatory for Divine Demon, but his mind couldn’t find a solution.

Tinges of azure energy flowed inside his mind to empower his Divine Deduction technique, but no favorable idea appeared. Shock filled Divine Demon when he sensed that his law was about to fail him.

Divine Demon’s aura began to grow wild. Flares of azure energy shot out of his figure and tainted the whiteness while stealing part of its power. His law inevitably expanded, and his influence generated effects that his friends feared.

Lumps of azure energy amassed around Divine Demon. His influence made them take different shapes as faint murmurs escaped his mouth. The expert had entered a frenzy, and his law reflected his mental state.

"Did you actually do it on purpose?" Wilfred complained. "How do you plan of calming him down in this situation."

"We’ll think about that after we leave this damned trap!" Noah roared before placing both swords on his forehead.

The crackling figures were about to launch another wave of lightning bolts, but their bodies disappeared as Noah’s sharpness engulfed the area. Even the whiteness vanished as his singularity expanded.

Noah single-handedly expanded the battlefield and revealed more parts previously hidden by the light. Many crackling figures died under the might of his attack fueled with the empowered centers of power.

The ambition had forced Noah to become a fully-fledged solid stage hybrid, and the sheer power he could unleash was immense. Those were only imitations of his real breakthroughs, but they allowed him to show his superiority anyway.

"Remove Heaven and Earth’s influence!" Noah ordered. "Don’t let the light return. We can’t find a way out of here as long as the rulers continue to have control over the area."

"Where should we concentrate our attacks?" One of the cultivators near Noah asked.

"Everywhere," Noah ordered before closing his eyes again.

A second massive singularity expanded from his figure and pushed the light backward. More chunks of the area became part of the battlefield, and many crackling figures hidden by the whiteness died under the attack.

Noah’s orders weren’t clear, but his friends understood how to follow them anyway.

King Elbas took a disposable upper tier weapon and threw it inside a white area. Noah’s anger covered the item and allowed it to have destructive effects on Heaven and Earth’s power.

The item exploded in the distance, and a golden radiance seeped through the whiteness before dispersing it. King Elbas cleared a large area on his own and set an example for the other cultivators.

Wilfred closed his eyes, and bulging veins grew on his arms. The hybrid tried to join his palms, but the move seemed to require his full physical strength. Sweat even fell from his forehead as he used his entire power to make his hands touch.

A loud noise resounded from another area filled with whiteness, and shockwaves soon followed the event. Heaven and Earth’s light crumbled as Wilfred’s destructive force spread through the battlefield and cleared a large zone.

Robert raised his hand, and a crazy smile appeared on his face. A purple mass appeared on his palm and began to expand until it became a giant sphere made of toxic energy.

The expert threw the sphere toward a white area, and Heaven and Earth’s light screamed as the toxic energy destroyed everything on its path. Robert cleared a huge chunk of the battlefield on his own, but that destruction didn’t seem to satisfy him. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The Foolery threw itself into a white area. Noah followed its movements with the corner of his eyes, but he had no way to stop it. Yet, the light in that spot quickly started to retreat, and the pig soon reappeared once it cleared the whole zone.

The pig then pooped on the area. Its excrements fused with the air and generated blue bushes that thrived among its influence. Some of them even reached the nearby white zones and fed on their light.

Crackling figures would appear whenever an expert cleared part of the white area. Heaven and Earth had amassed an immense army among their light, but Noah tried to take care of them every time.

Noah continued to keep his blades on his forehead as his attention remained on the battlefield. His sharpness intensified whenever a crackling figure appeared. Those creatures couldn’t do anything against his attacks.

His body was falling apart since he couldn’t burn anything, but Noah ignored his pain and pressed forward. He would have time to heal once he survived the crisis.

Fergie, Luke, and Harold divided the weaker troops into different platoons to take care of multiple white zones at the same time. Torrents of spells came out of them and continued to expand the battlefield as they destroyed Heaven and Earth’s light.

Only one expert had yet to make his move. Divine Demon continued to acc.u.mulate energy while his frenzy intensified. However, no one had the time to check on him during that situation.

"Continue to destroy everything!" Noah roared as blood acc.u.mulated in his mouth. "Something will eventually appear if we dig deep enough."

Noah didn’t fully believe in his words. His plan was far from perfect, but it was the best tactic he could come up with in that short time.

The area under Heaven and Earth’s control was immense. His companions were clearing large zones with every exchange, but there was far too much light in the environment.

Noah didn’t know how large that white environment was, but he believed that his companions wouldn’t be able to express that superior power for long. They would eventually deplete their energy, and his situation wasn’t any better.

’I need to burn something,’ Noah commented in his mind before stabbing his teeth inside the fabric of space.

Cracks spread from its teeth and opened a passage to the Shadow Domain. His flames and dark matter quickly flowed inside that separate dimension before the fissure closed.

Noah controlled the Shadow Domain to reopen in the distance. A fiery dark world suddenly expanded among the whiteness and burnt a large zone, but Noah only cared about the energy that returned toward him.

The crackling figures among the light quickly focused on the fiery dark world. White lightning bolts flashed from inside the whiteness and landed on Noah’s technique, destroying it piece by piece. It only took two series of attacks to take care of all the dark matter.

Noah cursed in his mind. His flames didn’t manage to heal him much. They had only succeeded in stabilizing his condition, which was far from optimal since he had to continue attacking.

However, he noticed with the corner of his eyes that Divine Demon had finally decided to move. The expert shot forward while waves of azure and dark-blue energy followed him, and a dark trail came out of his back.

"Follow the crazy one!" Noah shouted, and the entire army turned toward Divine Demon.

The experts interrupted their attacks but didn’t disperse the acc.u.mulated energy. They shot after Divine Demon and avoided his trails as they continued to destroy the white zones around them.

It seemed that they finally had a path to follow.
