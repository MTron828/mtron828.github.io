A table filled with delicacies was placed right in the middle of one of the most luxurious rooms of the Ballor mansion.

The table divided the cultivators in the room according to their families.

June, her father, and the Patriarch of the Ballor family were on one side while William, Rhys, and Adrian were on the other one.

"Lord Otis, I want to express my appreciation for allowing us to meet the heir of your family today."

Adrian spoke in a polite manner to the Patriarch of the Ballor family.

Otis was an elderly man with short silver hair and a long white beard, he waved his hand at Adrian’s words with a wide smile on his face.

"This is just a small matter, we are happy to help the Balvan family."

The Ballor family was just a small-size noble family, even if they were in a different domain, they had still to respect a more powerful family.

"I’ve already spoken to my daughter, she has agreed to answer all your questions."

June’s father joined the conversation, expressing his good intentions toward that meeting.

June didn’t speak, she simply stared at Rhys with cold eyes.

"Thank you, Lord Max, we just want to ask a few questions to your daughter. Specifically, we would like to know what kind of relationship did she have with Noah." Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Five heads turned toward June who simply continued to stare at Rhys.

Max pressed his hands on her shoulder and spoke to her in a soft voice.

"June, they have asked their question."

June nodded.

"I know, I was just confused."

"Confused by what exactly?"

Rhys asked that question, he had become quite impatient under her gaze.

"You know, when they told me that you had driven out a genius like Vance, I imagined that you were some kind of powerful asset. It seems that I was wrong."

June plainly answered.

She was really surprised that Noah’s father was only an ordinary cultivator, her mocking though was purely out of anger.

"How dare you!?"

Rhys stood up from his seat and was about to slap her when William grabbed his arm.

"My Lord, she has a rank 4 body, you will only hurt yourself."

Rhys’ pupils constricted as he stared at the young woman in front of him and he coughed loudly before sitting again.

"I’m sorry for her temperament, it’s my fault if she came out this wild."

Max performed a slight bow but he was unable to hide the proud smile that had appeared on his face.

The truth was that the Balvan family could bully them but they couldn’t touch June at all.

Not only was she a former student of the academy, but she was also actively working for the Royal family, her position was too high.

Otis Ballor had simply approved the meeting to silence any rumor concerning June’s relationship with Noah.

"It’s fine, you too please forgive my brother’s temper. You can imagine how this situation is affecting his mental health."

Adrian spoke.

He didn’t care about June’s words, they were true after all, he just wanted to obtain any valuable information.

"So, were you in a romantic relationship with him?"

He asked.

June lowered her gaze, that question reminded her of the one that Noah asked her back in the academy.

"No, we were just fighting partners."

"But you have lived together with him for quite some time, right?"

"Yes."

"I wonder if you have learned anything from your cohabitation with him."

Adrian led the conversation right to the part he was interested in.

June lowered her gaze again, her mind reviewed the memories that she had of Noah.

"No, he has always been extremely careful, he has never revealed anything about himself."

Otis coughed lightly to join the conversation.

"June, he is a criminal, try to remember something at least."

However, his words only triggered June’s anger again.

"What something? All I knew of him was that his name was Vance and that he was stronger than me. He has never spoken about himself, he has never asked anything to anyone, he has basically spent three years cultivating like a madman!"

William lowered his head at those words, they perfectly described the youth that he remembered.

"So, you don’t know where he went?"

June shook his head at Adrian’s question.

"No, he didn’t trust me either."

Silence enveloped the room, the cultivators from the Balvan family understood that they had just wasted their time.

William wanted to speak but his position didn’t allow him to do so, he was just there to try to understand any hidden message in June’s words.

’You forsake even this girl’s affection...My disciple, I’m really sorry.’

He couldn’t help but blame himself for Noah’s trust issues, his position had always been complicated in the mansion, he had never had the ability to actively help him.

June, on the other hand, was just venting her anger.

She had joined the meeting to learn more about Noah but she had been clearly disappointed.

Her anger didn’t come from the men in front of her but had birthed from Noah’s last words.

’If you ever try to use that power to harm me, I will forsake all the good moments that we had together and kill you without hesitation.’

She clearly remembered those words spoken while she was receiving the inheritance.

’In the end, you couldn’t trust me.’

Her anger came from that single moment.

Noah had nothing, no one to rely on, no one looking after him.

He was carrying the burden of Eccentric’s inheritance and he had to give it to someone.

He had chosen June but he had done so because of the situation.

That realization had hurt June and she was still carrying that sorrow.

Her hands tightened in a fist every time she thought about that moment, that last interaction with Noah.

’I bothered you so much about your true self... I was really an idiot. The next time I see you, I’ll make sure that you understand my position toward you.’

With that resolution in her mind, June stood up from the table and left the meeting, going back to cultivate.
