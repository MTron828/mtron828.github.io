Chapter 1127 1127. Range

Noah, First Prince, and First Princess found three more lumps of white light in the five months that followed their battle.

The spheres had different sizes depending on how many raw laws they contained, but Noah took all of them without even asking for the Royals’ opinion. The duo from the Elbas family didn’t complain either. They had accepted their position in the group and wanted only to find their Father now.

Noah’s condition improved greatly because of those resources. The raw laws could increase the level of all his centers of power, which made them the best nutrient in the entire lower plane.

However, his dantian didn’t advance. The laws obtained his individuality when they came in contact with his aura, and they fused with his organ, but that wasn’t enough to push it to the sixth rank.

Noah didn’t overthink about that matter. He didn’t have another solution, so he would try everything that the separate dimension offered him.

He didn’t fear for the condition of his centers of power since his species had made them extremely durable. His dark star even removed the addicting properties from the raw laws, so he could push his dantian’s limits as much as he wanted.

The Royals’ mood worsened as they saw Noah becoming stronger right in front of their eyes. Yet, they never gave voice to any complaint. They could only wait for their Father to rectify the chain of command.

A change happened in that month. The Royals and Noah had flown in the void for so long that they couldn’t miss the appearance of two more consciousnesses in their range.

Noah knew that King Elbas wasn’t among those two existences because he had paid attention to the Royals’ tracking inscriptions, so he immediately changed direction when he sensed them.

Great Elder Diana and Elder Regina soon appeared in his vision. The two women were at the peak of their power, and broad smiles shined on their faces.

Their expressions looked strange. They both appeared ecstatic, and they didn’t even bother to inspect the trio that had joined them.

"Did you find any raw law?" Noah asked before even greeting them.

His instincts were sending confusing signals to his mind. Part of him felt in danger, while the other didn’t find anything off with that situation.

"Yes," Elder Regina said as her smile stiffened. Her expression began to relax after her answer, but some confusion still lingered on her face afterward.

"Let’s look for more," Great Elder Diana conveyed before directly turning to fly toward the white stars in the distance. She didn’t even look at the others as she set off.

Elder Regina appeared to struggle to disperse her confusion, but she quickly chased after her Matriarch anyway.

The Royals exchanged an understanding glance, and Noah didn’t fail to notice that gesture. However, he didn’t look at them. His eyes sharpened, but he went after the duo from the Council anyway.

First Prince and First Princess hesitated, but Noah stopped to glance at them before resuming his flight. The duo understood his silent order and followed him through the void.

Noah and the Royals had understood that there was something wrong with the experts from the Council. The raw laws had to be the cause behind their strange behavior, but they didn’t appear dangerous just yet.

Another month had to pass before the five of them found more raw laws. There were two lumps of white light, and Noah separated from the group to near the smaller sphere.

Great Elder Diana did the same with the larger sphere, and her aura surged to make it gain her qualities. She then placed the raw laws directly on her low-waist that absorbed them without any struggle.

Noah felt slightly surprised by how quickly the Matriarch had completed the absorption, but he didn’t care too much about it. Still, Elder Regina suddenly appeared next to him, who was about to pour his aura in the raw laws in his grasp.

"Give them to me," Elder Regina said, and her mental waves conveyed her threatening tone when they landed on Noah’s consciousness.

Noah ignored her, and his aura surged to bind that resource to his individuality. The Elder watched him eating the lump of light, and her expression turned dark when it disappeared from her vision.

"You..." Elder Regina struggled to send that mental message, "You stole them."

Noah’s eyes sharpened when he sensed her intentions. His reptilian pupils went on her eyes, and his consciousness focused on her confused mental sphere.

Elder Regina gathered "Breath" in her palms, but the sharpness carried by Noah’s mind broke her concentration and made her lose her grip over that energy.

Anger started to build inside her, but her mind was too confused to deploy any protection against Noah’s influence. His mental waves cut right through her mind and forced her to sort her chaotic thoughts.

Elder Regina struggled to focus, and her mental defenses suddenly appeared around her figure.

Noah prepared himself to fight since he couldn’t suppress her anymore, but the Elder revealed her regular expression when she lifted her face again.

"My apologies," Elder Regina said as she performed a deep bow, "It seems that I was about to fall prey to the raw laws’ addiction. Thank you for awakening me."

Noah nodded at her polite gesture. He felt glad that he had avoided the battle again, but his problems didn’t end there.

A heavy consciousness unfolded and applied pressure to everyone in the area. The group recognized Great Elder Diana’s aura, but they didn’t see the Council’s composed Matriarch when they looked toward her.

Orange sparks crackled around Great Elder Diana’s figure as she moved her gaze among her companions. Her eyes moved madly among the experts until they eventually stopped on Noah.

"You stole them," Great Elder Diana conveyed, and the four experts felt her thoughts echoing inside their minds.

The direct contact with her consciousness made them understand how messy her mental state was. Great Elder Diana’s individuality focused on precision, so her chaotic thoughts didn’t suit her at all.

Noah’s mind sent warning signals. His instincts even told him to leave the area and escape since the situation had become too dangerous.

Yet, Noah had nowhere to go. He was inside Great Elder Diana’s range. He wasn’t sure that he could escape her attack even if he relied on his movement technique.

"Matriarch," Elder Regina stepped forward to near Great Elder Diana, "We have prepared sedatives to solve this issue. You can use mines if you want to save yours."

Elder Regina took out a bottle filled with a dense green liquid and handed it to her Matriarch, but Noah suddenly appeared behind her and threw her away before leaving in a hurry.

Great Elder Diana exploded into a storm of lightning bolts that unleashed a destructive force in the environment. The power of the liquid stage of the sixth rank brimmed in those attacks, but they didn’t hit any of her companions.

First Prince and First Princess had always remained at some distance since their reunion, so they could escape the lightning bolts’ range even if they noticed the attack after Noah.

Elder Regina stopped herself after flying uncontrollably in the void. Noah had saved her with his last gesture, but the situation didn’t seem good at all from her position.

Noah reappeared in a distant spot in the void. The light radiated by the lightning bolts illuminated his face, and Great Elder Diana’s consciousness still pressed on his mind.

He wasn’t outside her range, and he knew that escaping wasn’t a possibility since the Matriarch’s eyes had remained on him for the whole duration of the spell.
