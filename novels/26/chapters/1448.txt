Chapter 1451 1451. Transformation

Jordan and Cassandra fought above the others, high in the white sky.

The two exchanged violent blows, creating shockwaves that spread through the very structure of the sky. Jordan spat flames and flapped her wings to launch dense gales that detonated mid-air. Instead, Cassandra controlled the flow of her opponent’s attacks to redirect them.

They had yet to start fighting seriously, but everything changed when a loud roar echoed through the area. Jordan revealed a broad smile, and Cassandra wore a shocked expression when she glanced at the land below.

Jordan didn’t need to look down to understand what had happened. Hybrids didn’t need words to communicate. One roar was enough to express deep meanings like the victory over a powerful opponent.

"I think it’s time to end this façade," Jordan said as her scaled wings arched and released dense gales.

The gales seemed alive. They flew through the sky and surrounded Cassandra before converging toward her figure. A loud detonation followed and a hurricane formed in that spot.

Jordan’s true meaning was control. Her individuality depended on the amount of air that she could submit to her will. In theory, she could achieve something similar to the Shadow Domain as long as her opponents fell into her range.

The hurricane shrunk into the shape of a rotating sphere. The pressure in its insides was so high that most hybrids would struggle to survive in that environment. Yet, Jordan knew that Cassandra was still alive.

The sphere began to slow down. Its spin eventually stopped, and the whole attack opened to reveal Cassandra. She didn’t suffer any injury. Even her robe was perfectly fine.

"Charles might be dead," Cassandra said, "But the situation doesn’t change. I only need to kill all of you by myself."

"You can try if you want," Jordan said before launching more gales through her wings.

The winds transformed into a sea of sharp needles that flew toward Cassandra, but the cultivator waved her hand, and the attack condensed before dodging her figure.

The gale made of needles then flew around Cassandra to shoot toward Jordan. The cultivator only needed to wave her hands to send those attacks back toward her opponent.

Jordan’s wings flapped again, and winds clashed with the incoming attack. Cassandra’s technique didn’t manage to do much, but that didn’t solve Jordan’s situation.

"Can you use your attacks?" Jordan asked. "I have already grown tired of these exchanges."

"You asked for it," Cassandra replied, and her individuality surged as a massive whirlpool formed among the sky.

Water also materialized as her aura flowed into the environment. The whirlpool had Cassandra as its center and caught Jordan in its external layers.

Even with her hybrid strength, Jordan didn’t manage to escape from those raging currents. The whirlpool dragged her along its rotations, and she felt the pressure landing on her body increasing as she reached deeper areas of the structure.

"I prefer to use my opponents’ attacks to fight," Cassandra said from the center of the whirlpool. "My techniques put an end to battles too quickly."

The pressure restrained Jordan’s wings and her movements. She felt unable to do anything to escape from that attack. Her skin also started to cave in as the force pressing on her body continued to increase.

The whirlpool was a perfect trap that she couldn’t escape. Jordan could predict that her body would be nothing more than a meat paste by the time she reached the center of the technique.

"I expected more from you," Cassandra said. "It’s rare to find hybrids in the solid stage, but I guess that you have reached this level by sacrificing your potential. Your attacks are below the average of cultivators at your stage."

"Of course," Jordan said. "It’s hard to pretend to be a human. Your form is so limiting."

Shock appeared on Cassandra’s face when she heard that voice. Jordan was already halfway through the whirlpool. The pressure there was so intense that no sound could escape.

However, Cassandra had heard that voice. Something was off, and her shock increased when she glanced toward Jordan. Her opponent had disappeared. Only her robe continued to flow through the whirlpool.

When the robe crumbled, a large shadow appeared above Cassandra. The cultivator saw a giant dragon when she raised her head. Amber scales covered the forty meters long creature, but its eyes were the same as her opponent.

"Humans," Jordan’s mocking voice came out of the dragon before it spat a wave of red flames that covered the whole whirlpool.

The pressure radiated by Cassandra’s technique captured the flames and forced them to flow along the currents. However, signs of instability began to appear on the whirlpool as that massive fire fused with its figure.

Jordan continued to spit flames, and Cassandra eventually helped her technique to disperse the attack. The whirlpool absorbed the fire and destroyed it through its pressure, but Jordan’s assault didn’t stop. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The currents started to fall apart as Jordan’s offensive continued. The whirlpool slowly crumbled under the might of those flames. Only Cassandra didn’t move. The fire didn’t even touch her.

"What an annoying individuality," Jordan said as a sigh escaped her draconic mouth.

"Your attacks are only slightly stronger than average," Cassandra replied as a mocking tone seeped into her words. "You might have changed form, but your power is still nothing compared to my law."

"Your knowledge of us is laughable," Jordan said as she completely unfolded her wings. "My fire is only an innate ability. It has nothing to do with my individuality or mental energy."

Cassandra understood what Jordan meant, but it was already too late for her. Jordan flapped her massive wings, and a mountain made of air fell on the cultivator.

The expert waved her hands to disperse the immense gale, but her power fell short against that technique. Jordan had moved too much air with her attack. Cassandra couldn’t redirect something that carried so much energy.

The immense gale slammed on Cassandra and flung her back on the ground. Blood accumulated in her mouth and on the corners of her eyes when she hit the terrain. The attack had been no different than a direct punch from a magical beast.

Cassandra had survived only because her individuality had allowed her to disperse part of the attack’s power, but that didn’t change her situation. The massive dragon had begun to dive toward her. Cassandra had to do something, or she would die in the following exchange.

The cultivator created a massive dome that rotated and absorbed energy during its spins. Once it had accumulated enough power, it shot a condensed vertical current that pierced Jordan’s draconic belly and opened a large injury.

Jordan didn’t care about that wound. She continued to dive and gain speed under the concerned gaze of her opponent. Cassandra continued to use her dome to launch condensed currents, but the Dragon didn’t mind enduring them.

Once Jordan was about to reach the ground, she unfolded her wings to stop and gather violent winds. Then, she threw those gales toward the ground, unleashing a shockwave that affected even the battlefields close to her.

The dome tried to fend off that attack, but the wall of wind was too dense for the technique. Cassandra could only watch as currents fell from her spell and an immense pressure landed on her body.

Before she could do anything, the pressure turned Cassandra into a bloody pulp. Jordan had only needed to hit her once to kill her.
