Chapter 1052 1052. Intimacy

The loyal troops of the Elbas family shot toward the ashes of the rebels after the flames dispersed. They madly searched through the remains of Noah’s destruction, but there was nothing left in the area.

Their angry gazes shot toward Noah when they realized that they had lost those studies forever. The Elbas family’s factions had invested a lot in the research, and now everything was gone.

However, they didn’t complain. The Royals could only lower their gazes when they met the cold reptilian eyes. It was as if Noah was waiting to have an excuse to kill them.

"Restore the teleportation matrices," Noah said as he turned to leave. "I want to see everything that you have retrieved."

The fact that he was the only powerhouse there made him the ruler of the entire world. No one could oppose him, so he could exploit the situation as much as he wanted.

He didn’t decide to destroy the studies due to a whim. Ebano’s plan was solid, and it would have forced the three ruling organizations to waste resources and share the trades’ gains.

Yet, the Hive didn’t have much to lose. Actually, obtaining and sharing those studies would have weakened its position in the main world.

The Hive was the only force that could deploy hybrids efficiently and without risking a revolt. Obtaining the studies would have improved its understanding of the compound, but it would have also taken away its advantage.

If every organization were to learn how to produce and control hybrids, the Elbas family would soon surpass both the Hive and the Council regarding knowledge in that field.

The Royal Pool wouldn’t be the only problem of the alliance. The Elbas family would obtain the perfect method to weaponize magical beasts and improve its cultivators’ overall power.

The Hive and the Council could do the same, but they didn’t have as many experts as their enemy. Sharing that knowledge would slowly make them fall behind in the political environment.

Instead, now that the studies were no more, the Hive could continue to hold the monopoly over obedient hybrids and living weapons, making it a threatening force to face. The Council would benefit from the trades with its ally, while the Elbas family would have to restart their research.

Noah didn’t believe that he could restrain the Royals forever, but his decision had made his organization gain more time.

Only the higher-ups of the other world’s forces understood the reasons behind his actions, and they couldn’t help but fear his ruthlessness. Noah had decided to destroy studies capable of changing the cultivation journey forever to preserve his organization’s advantage.

He had made the whole world suffer only to benefit a bit more from his current position.

Noah sent a series of mental messages through his inscribed notebook while he occupied the fortress’s best training area. His mind was too busy handling his bitter mood and his excitement toward his potential to care about his image.

He had accepted that he couldn’t do anything to stop his negative feeling. They were inevitable since they were the consequence of his wide path.

’Men can truly appreciate happiness only after they experience sadness,’ Noah thought as he let his mind wander while cultivating inside the training area. ’I appreciate strength because I know weakness. I appreciate life because I know death.’

Killing Luke made him feel as if he had negated part of his past, but he had taken steps toward the future.

That mindset had helped him during the travel. Those bitter feelings had sharpened his mind, allowing him to complete his movement technique in a little more than two months.

The Demons eventually returned, and June came right after. Noah found truth in his previous thoughts when his lover caressed his face as if knowing that something disturbed his mind.

"You expose yourself to more sufferings as your existence reaches new levels of greatness," June said as she laid her head on his lap. "A being pursuing only destruction can’t feel, but it can’t improve either. An existence that can only create will feel everything, but it will never take a step for fear of hurting grass."

Her words resounded in the training area as she turned to find a comfortable position on him. The Demons left when they saw that the couple was having one of their intimate moments, and they felt that both of them needed to rest.

"An existence in the middle of both realms might go nowhere," Noah said as he caressed her hair. "His duality might crush him while he looks for what he is."

"There has never been a middle, Noah," June said. "You of all existences should know that we can’t strive for balance anymore. We either take everything, or we die."

June was mostly speaking for herself, but her battle intent had always shared similar features to Noah’s ambition. The two of them had both chosen difficult paths and were suffering from different backlashes.

June’s Perfect Circuit couldn’t contain the immense power that she had obtained, and Noah’s individuality made him lose himself in thoughts concerning the nature of his existence often.

"You couldn’t contain your battle intent," Noah said while wearing a smile and looking at his lover in the eyes.

"And your ambition didn’t allow you to shrink your individuality," June said as a similar smile appeared on her face.

They had known each other so well and for so long that they could understand the difficulties of their respective journey even if they were approaching the laws.

"You need one last battle," Noah whispered as his hand went to untie her robe. "Succeed, and you will be able to fight forever."

"You have already destroyed a world," June said as she opened his robe to kiss his torso. "You only need to create a new one now."

Understanding flowed incessantly in both their minds. Talking with their partner cleared many doubts about the path in front of them and steeled their resolve.

The revolution had been a simple prelude to the main event. What expected Noah and June in the main world was far more dangerous, but it was necessary for their situation.

They had decided to come out in the open, but they had to complete one last deed before announcing to the world that June was a traitor and that Noah could have feelings.

The couple indulged in a long intimate moment in which Noah had to make sure to leave the restrictions made with his higher energy intact. His arousal returned as the sound of kisses and moans resounded in the training area. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Noah discovered how careful his body could be, and he learnt how to control himself as he held June’s naked back in his hands.

The couple did their best to satisfy the desire accumulated for the past centuries and decided to come out of the fortress only after three months.

The time had come for Noah to contact the best inscription master in the world. June’s life depended on whether King Elbas would believe his lie.
