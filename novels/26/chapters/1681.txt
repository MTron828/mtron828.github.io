Chapter 1682 - 1682. Gruesome

"How dare you attack your allies?!" Castor shouted as his solid stage cultivation level exploded.

"The Devils must have corrupted his mind!" Rebecca added as her power also filled the environment.

"Let’s take care of him before the Devils overwhelm us," Melissa ordered while pointing her hands toward Noah.

"I didn’t think there would be traitors among our army," Robert, the fourth solid stage cultivator, snorted.

Noah didn’t even glance at the four experts. His figure disappeared before they could launch attacks. He teleported among the sharks, and his roar made those creatures tremble in fear.

"You belong to me," Noah growled as his pride spread through the sky.

The army of sharks had suffered countless defeats against the human side, but some of the upper tier specimens were still standing their ground. Noah’s roar made them feel fear, but they wouldn’t give up on their freedom so easily.

One of the upper tier specimens turned to charge at Noah and left trails of sparks in the sky. Still, its attack ended when its head landed on Noah’s palm.

"I think you misunderstand your position," Noah growled while stabbing his fingers on the creature’s head. "I wasn’t giving an order. You already are part of my pack."

His ambition flowed inside the creature’s flesh and generated mutations. Noah’s law wanted to improve the shark, but the chaotic laws had made a mess of its body.

The shark even tried to fight that energy. It struggled to fend off Noah’s ambition, but that only intensified its dangerous effects.

The shark’s body began to destabilize as new mutations started to appear. Noah’s ambition intensified the various unstable feature of the creature and made its tissues crumble.

The magical beast exploded after a few seconds. Pieces of flesh shot in every direction and created a red cloud before Noah’s energy devoured it. He had killed an upper tier creature with a simple attack that didn’t even rely on techniques.

A wave of pride violently spread from Noah’s figure after his victory against the shark. A chill ran down the other upper tier magical beasts when that feeling enveloped them. They immediately realized that Noah could kill them at ease.

That realization made them lower their head to express their submission. Noah deployed the dark world to envelop them and activated the workshop while filling the dark matter with his ambition. The sharks couldn’t fight in that condition. He had to transform them.

The four solid stage cultivators didn’t let Noah do as he pleased. Massive spells flew toward the dark world, but holes connected to the void opened on its structure before the attacks could damage the technique.

The spells entered the void and left the dark world untouched. Noah had countered the attacks of four solid stage cultivators at ease, and the scene made the entire human army fall silent.

Even the Devils stopped attacking to admire the scene. Noah’s feat was inspiring. Those creatures had inherited his d.e.s.i.r.e to improve, so they wouldn’t dare to miss that sight.

Faint ambition began to come out of the Devils. Noah’s feat had forced those creatures to improve and develop traces of laws that reflected his existence. The chaotic laws had a purpose now. They wanted to become Noah.

The solid stage cultivators didn’t give up. They launched a second wave of attacks, but portals that led to the void opened on their trajectory again.

However, the spells divided themselves into countless smaller attacks that dodged the portals and exploded on the dark matter. The higher energy couldn’t endure their might, and chunks of the technique vanished.

The shockwaves generated by the many small explosions spread through the dark world and continued to destroy the technique. The dense sea slowly vanished and revealed its insides. The human army could finally see what Noah had been up to, and the scene left those experts speechless.

Some structures made of dark matter had survived the offensive. Multiple arms that resembled machines of Noah’s previous world were tinkering with the pack of sharks to create a gruesome scene.

The arms replaced entire chunks of the creatures’ flesh and transformed them into more stable tissues before putting them back into the bodies. Noah wanted to convert those magical beasts into existences that could help him in the fight, and his ambition was too violent for that procedure.

The workshop could learn from his ambition and understand how the sharks had to transform. The dark matter was using his law as fuel to perform those mutations and create an army worthy of their new leader.

"What on Heaven and Earth’s names is this madness?" Castor couldn’t help but shout.

Castor was an old solid stage cultivator in the eighth rank. He had seen countless experts and studied even more laws. However, he had never witnessed such a gruesome scene.

Noah was sitting cross-legged among the various workshops. He had kept his eyes closed to focus on the procedure, but the solid stage cultivators had interrupted his concentration.

"Do you mind letting me finish?" Noah asked while opening his eyes. "I’m almost done with the weaker specimens. The others need a bit more."

"You are a blight of this world!" Rebecca shouted, but she didn’t move.

Even Rebecca found it hard to stand that scene. Noah resembled a mad scientist in the middle of his experiment. She couldn’t help but imagine what he could do to humans if they ended up in his grasp.

Noah moved his gaze away from the four leaders. He wouldn’t mind them as long as they didn’t attack, and his sharks had even reached a crucial phase.

The workshops began to replace pieces of the creatures’ heads. The sharks died while chunks of their brain left their body and transformed under the effects of the dark matter.

"What have you done?" Melissa asked while her consciousness studied that energy.

Waves of shock filled her mind as she understood the nature of that energy. The sharks were releasing a strange version of "Breath". Noah had built a dantian for those creatures.

’To think that creating a center of power has become so easy at my current level,’ Noah sighed in his mind.

The sharks began to cry in anger after the workshop let them go. Noah had made sure to put part of his feelings inside those creatures. Their aggression skyrocketed because of that.

The Devils echoed that anger. Raging waves of chaotic laws spread from their figure and fell on the human army. It was time to resume the fight now that the last piece of Noah’s pack was ready.

"I guess you won’t give me the chance to have one versus one battles," Noah sighed while leaving the array of workshops.

A few sharks still had to complete their transformation, but the process could work without Noah’s supervision now. He could finally move his attention on the human army, and a faint hesitation inevitably appeared in his mind. Yet, the d.e.s.i.r.e to understand how strong he had become suppressed that feeling.

Noah stretched his arm forward, and chunks of dark matter solidified in his palm to generate the Demonic Sword. Roots gathered in his other hand to create a sword-shaped weapon. His companions then came out of the separate space and stood next to him.

Noah was ready to test his power against four solid stage cultivators.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m
