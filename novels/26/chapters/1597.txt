Chapter 1598 1598. Crazy

Noah had never witnessed such a chaotic mental battle. Alexander’s mind contained an army of magical beasts that tried to destroy his mental walls as soon as his suppression vanished.

The various specimens had different levels. They went from the heroic ranks to the peak of the eighth rank. Noah could even see some creatures that bordered the ninth rank among that massive army.

Dark matter flowed out of Noah’s chest and entered Alexander’s mind. The expert’s mental walls could withstand that pressure, especially since Noah focused on stabilizing the mental walls. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

His black mental energy also entered Alexander’s mind. His mental waves immediately attacked the weaker ethereal figures and devoured them to reduce part of the power of the immense army.

Alexander slowly regained some clarity. His mental waves stopped being a mess of violent waves and began to suppress the various magical beasts through organized attacks.

Noah continued to use his mental energy to devour the ethereal figures while slowly withdrawing his dark matter. Alexander didn’t need the higher energy anymore after Noah’s efforts.

Alexander eventually calmed down, and Noah stopped devouring ethereal figures. A pressure landed on his mind when his mental waves returned inside his center of power, but his mental walls quickly took care of it.

"You are quite resourceful," Alexander laughed while laying on the ground.

"And you are a mess," Noah sighed while sitting in front of him. "Though, I must thank you. I didn’t know you could hold your ground against rank 9 existences."

"I can’t!" Alexander exclaimed before exploding in a laugh again. "Do you have any idea of how many innate abilities I had to fuse to launch that attack? You are lucky I didn’t end up eating you all."

"I actually have an idea now," Noah said while giving voice to a faint laugh.

The others went through different emotions while watching that interaction. Initially, they remained speechless at the sight of their leaders ignoring the imminent threat. Then, they sighed before sitting next to them.

It was clear that they had to discuss how to handle Radiant Eyes and the white expert. They had escaped before understanding how the battle between the rank 9 existences would go, but they had to prepare for the worst.

Yet, they had some time now. Alexander had managed to get them out of that hopeless situation, so they could prepare for the threat. Of course, they didn’t have many ideas when it came to fending off rank 9 existences.

Divine Demon took out a few jugs of wine before handing cups to the other experts. No one dared to reject that offer, so they soon found themselves drinking in silence.

"Do you lose abilities when the ethereal creatures vanish?" Noah eventually asked.

Alexander shook his head. "No. They are part of my drawbacks. They become part of my existence and try to break out of my mind whenever I turn my attention elsewhere."

"I might be able to take care of that issue one day," Noah explained. "I can even start working on the weaker magical beasts for now."

"Your mental waves are quite peculiar," Alexander replied. "I won’t mind relying on you in the future. The Legion needs strong leaders."

"Does anyone want to talk about the two monsters in the human domain?" Jordan eventually asked and forced the group to focus on the main issue.

"I can’t fight them," Alexander quickly said. "Maybe I can block an attack, but that’s it."

"They might kill each other," Second Prince exclaimed.

"Luck won’t help us," Noah sighed. "We can only hide for now. Let’s gather our troops and move deeper into the Outer Lands."

"Actually, we can hope in Heaven and Earth’s victory," Luke explained. "They won’t come after us, not with a rank 9 cultivator at least."

"How can you be so sure of that?" King Elbas asked.

"They must respect their fairness," Luke continued. "The laws of the world will lose power if they break their own rules."

Luke’s explanation gave the group a greater understanding of the Immortal Lands. Those few words managed to make them consider the higher plane as a consequence of Heaven and Earth’s individuality.

"There might be something else now that I think about it," Noah suddenly announced as an idea appeared in his mind.

Talking about Heaven and Earth had reminded him of the two existences who had died because of those powerful underlings. Great Builder and Supreme Thief had been monsters during their eras. Noah didn’t know whether they were stronger than Radiant Eyes, but having them at their side would significantly improve their situation.

"How can you even have ideas that can work against rank 9 existences?" King Elbas snorted. "Are we about to do something completely crazy, right?"

"I have done crazier," Noah whispered. "Kind of."

"That’s my heir!" Divine Demon shouted. "Let’s do that!"

"You don’t even know what he is proposing!" King Elbas complained.

"You should trust your friends more, dad," Second Prince commented.

"I thought the Immortal Lands had to push me on a solitary path," King Elbas sighed. "How did I even surround myself with these idiots?"

"We must resurrect Great Builder and Supreme Thief," Noah explained his plan while those experts bickered.

His announcement made Luke’s team, King Elbas, Jordan, and Alexander spit their wine. That revelation had been too sudden, and its contents were far crazier than they expected.

"Do you want to resurrect rank 9 existences to take care of rank 9 existences?!" King Elbas shouted. "That’s completely idiotic! We want to take care of our threats, not increase them."

"Do you even know their character?" Luke asked. "Do you want me to tell you some of the stories recorded in the archives of the secret organization?"

"I must say that they aren’t completely wrong," Alexander whispered. "We shouldn’t trade a threat for another."

"A possible threat is better than a clear one," Noah snorted. "Don’t chicken out now. I’d rather avoid spending the next millennia running away."

"I’m with you, my heir!" Divine Demon shouted. "Though, who is Great Builder?"

"Can you stop forgetting important things?" King Elbas complained.

"This is the secret behind my power," Divine Demon snorted. "You should try it sometime. I don’t mind instructing you on my ways."

"This might actually work," Jordan said while Divine Demon and King Elbas continued to bicker.

"It’s set then," Noah announced while standing up. "Luke and his team will take care of gathering the various allied cells in the secret organization. Elbas and his son will work with the Balrow family to create the teleport. The others must focus on their training. We have an inheritance to complete."

"I will join this mission," Alexander explained, "But I will run in the Outer Lands as soon as we complete it. My mind can’t take it anymore. I need to let my instincts go wild for a while."

"Nonsense," Noah snorted. "You have just become the best training method for my mind. I will slowly devour the magical beasts inside your mental sphere and stretch your stable period."

"I can think of something to help," King Elbas announced. "I became curious about your condition anyway. I already have a few blueprints in mind."

"I will help Elbas with the blueprints!" Divine Demon announced.

"I’m considering switching sides," King Elbas sighed.

"We have a plan then," Noah exclaimed. "Alexander, come with me. We have a lot of work to do."
