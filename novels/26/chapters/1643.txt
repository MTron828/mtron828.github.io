Chapter 1646 - 1646. Peace

The Heaven Tribulations continued to rage and fill the sky with crackling noises. The destruction of the humanoid figure didn’t put an end to the Devil’s life. Its chaotic laws were still in the environment, but Noah couldn’t pinpoint their exact location.

The Devil’s aura was all over the place. It was everywhere, and Noah couldn’t find a core to destroy. He had never met such a unique opponent, but his excitement grew as he discovered more about that strange species.

The mutations intensified. More laws fell prey to that strange aura and escaped the nature imposed by Heaven and Earth. The whole sky seemed about to transform into a sea or rocks.

However, the mutations stopped affecting the world before radical transformations could happen. The tainted laws that had escaped Heaven and Earth’s system began to converge near Noah and gave birth to the dark-red figure he had destroyed a few moments ago.

The Devil took form, but it seemed far stronger than before. Noah could sense his instincts sending warning messages, but he didn’t raise his blade.

Attacking during the creation of that new body would be a wise choice, but Noah wasn’t fighting. He was studying that unknown species since he had already set his mind to develop that innate resistance.

The crazy laughter soon filled the sky again, and the black clouds didn’t hesitate to send more lightning bolts. Those attacks crashed on the Devil, but its structure absorbed their power.

A long blade soon grew out of the Devil’s left hand as its aura stopped spreading through the sky and amassed inside its figure. The creature had finally decided to fight Noah, but its transformation revealed part of its power.

It wasn’t a case that a sword had grown out of the Devil’s left hand. Noah had shown a similar battle style just a few moments ago. He couldn’t believe that the creature had always had experience with that.

’Did it copy me?’ Noah wondered before reaching different conclusions. ’No. A copy wouldn’t have this energy. It has probably learnt something about my battle style when my existence started to mutate.’

Noah stopped waiting and launched a slash, but the Devil quickly raised its sword. The singularity clashed with the blade, and multiple black spots appeared inside its structure.

The singularity was about to cut the Devil’s blade, but its impurities took over and forced that energy to shatter. The attack crumbled before it could inflict any damage. The Devil had tainted it before it could be a threat to its life.

’Its influence has intensified,’ Noah thought after studying the clash.

The Devil shot forward and tried to wave its blade at Noah, but a massive snake appeared in front of the creature and tried to crush its body.

Snore could release violent dark matter from every spot of its body, so the Devil soon found a wave of dark energy trying to destroy its figure. The snake didn’t only manage to restrain it. It had even started to suppress its power.

Still, the Devil’s influence eventually managed to affect Snore. The laws inside its structure began to mutate, and its body started to change under that power. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

A few chunks of that massive body transformed. They became water, rocks, air, and light that couldn’t remain attached to Snore. Its existence couldn’t keep those different materials inside its fabric.

’Night,’ Noah thought, and the Pterodactyl promptly shot toward Snore.

Night cut away the tainted pieces of Snore’s body and let the creature recover. The snake had to let the Devil go, but its figure quickly healed.

The Devil transformed again. Part of its damaged skin turned into a gaseous layer that hovered around its figure. A destructive force even filled that aura and increased the danger felt by Noah.

’Is it learning?’ Noah wondered when he saw those changes.

The new features that had appeared on the Devil resembled his dark matter. The Devil had learnt from Noah’s techniques and was evolving again.

A roar suddenly escaped Noah’s mouth. The unstable substance ran through his black vessels as his companions returned inside the separate space. Noah left only the Demonic Sword outside since its black hole could protect the weapon from that threatening influence.

Snore, Night, and Duanlong didn’t have Noah’s miraculous organs. The Devil could get a chance to take over his companions, and Noah couldn’t allow that.

Noah pressed his blade on his forehead. His consciousness expanded and locked on the Devil before a wave of sharpness filled the area.

A massive singularity suddenly opened on the Devil’s spot. The creature disappeared as soon as Noah’s attack landed on its figure, but its aura didn’t vanish.

The singularity dispersed quickly and revealed that the Devil was still on the same spot, even if multiple injuries had appeared on its body. Yet, the creature raised its sword without caring about its wounds and slashed it toward Noah,

A massive dark-red slash shot out of the Devil’s sword. The attack had fuming trails coming out of it and contained a dense mass of chaotic laws that transformed the air they crossed.

’It can’t completely copy my attacks then,’ Noah concluded. ’It still retains its nature even if it imitates my battle style.’

The Demonic Sword clashed with the dark-red slash and cut it in half. The chaotic laws that landed on the weapon modified its structure, but dark matter quickly came out of it and fixed those flaws.

Noah glanced at the Demonic Sword. The process had not been harmless for the weapon. The blade had suffered some slight structural damage that would require a few hours to fix.

’I might be unable to use my full power here,’ Noah thought before storing the Demonic Sword and shooting toward his enemy.

The Devil launched another slash, but Noah punched right through it. The chaotic laws that dispersed around him tried to modify his existence, but a layer of dark matter covered his skin and stopped that process.

Noah’s fingers took the shape of a blade before he waved his arm. His hand fell on the creature’s shoulder and opened a deep diagonal cut. A punch quickly followed that attack, and Noah soon found his limb stabbed inside the Devil’s c.h.e.s.t.

The mutations intensified at that distance. The Devil didn’t care about injuries. It was an entity meant to bring change into everything in its range, and Noah was deep inside that power.

A scarlet light filled Noah’s eyes. The Demonic Deduction technique produced violent thoughts that enhanced his destructive capabilities. A viable approach eventually appeared in his mind, and he didn’t hesitate to deploy it.

An azure light shone from behind Noah’s eyes. His greed seeped out of his figure and filled the sky. His aura was so intense that the noises generated by the Heaven Tribulations became unable to leave the dark clouds.

Noah d.e.s.i.r.ed the power held by the Devils. He wanted to know how they could oppose Heaven and Earth so effortlessly, and Supreme Thief’s ability was giving him a chance to avoid countless tests.

A suction force spread from the arm inside the Devil’s c.h.e.s.t. Noah began to absorb the dark-red fabric of its body and turn that material into knowledge.

A series of information filled his mind, but a dense will also tried to fuse with his existence. Noah found himself forced to interrupt Supreme Thief’s technique mid-way and summon the parasite.

Roots came out and spread across his arm before expanding toward the rest of the dark-red figure. The parasite’s corrosive aura destroyed those chaotic laws without bothering to absorb them. The black hole was making sure that the magical plant didn’t let that energy affect its structure.

The Devil quickly vanished. A dark halo covered the area before its figure completely disappeared. Even its unique aura died out at that point, and the sky finally found some peace.

Author’s notes: I think I have been unclear yesterday. I’m not taking another break. I just needed electricity to keep my laptop up. I’ve literally had nightmares about the missing chapters ahah. Don’t worry. You’ll get the other chapter in the next hours and three tomorrow.
