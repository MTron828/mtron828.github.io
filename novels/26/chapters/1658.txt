Chapter 1661 - 1661. Servants

Noah and Harold left their training areas to fly toward the next floating lake. Other natives might be waiting for them there, and Noah wanted to make sure that Heaven and Earth didn’t enlarge their army.

The final battle was approaching. The human forces of the other side of the Immortal Lands had just started gathering their assets. It was only a matter of time before a massive clearing operation started and led all the existences in the world against the Devils and the mutated magical beasts.

Noah was on the Devils’ side, but the human forces had yet to discover his betrayal. He would soon have to clash with those organizations, so he needed to prepare the battlefield and his existence for the fight.

Broken environments and strange sceneries crossed Noah’s vision as the duo followed the map’s instructions and traveled across the higher plane. Their destination wasn’t far away, but they proceeded slowly due to Noah’s needs.

Noah wanted to leave the training area since his companions and the cultivators from the other teams would look for him there. Traveling toward different regions would buy him some time. It would also grant him the chance to test his new understanding in a proper battle.

He was in desperate need of a fight right now. Noah had just added a breathtaking aspect to his existence, but his battle style had yet to adapt to those changes. He needed time to test his new techniques, but failures had to happen before he could reach a decent level of expertise.

The journey toward the other lake was uneventful. The duo met Devils and mutated sharks, but they decided to avoid them since their power couldn’t match those groups.

Part of Noah wanted to fight since he could deal with the strongest creatures in each group, but Harold was a liability. Noah couldn’t keep him in check while fighting with powerful beings.

Harold couldn’t break free of Noah’s spell, but he could suppress it with his law. That action always warned Noah and gave him enough time to intervene, but the situation would be different during a battle.

The lack of trust between the two experts made them arrive at the other floating lake far earlier than predicted. The duo found a familiar structure hanging from the sky, and they didn’t hesitate to approach it.

White lines appeared around the floating watery shape as soon as the experts flew toward the structure. The natives seemed able to deploy those untraceable formations at will, but Noah saw them as a mark of Heaven and Earth.

In theory, inscriptions had to leave a trace of their existence. Even King Elbas couldn’t create completely invisible items. His assets always triggered reactions in the experts that approached them.

Instead, the white lines were part of the world. They belonged to the very fabric of the higher plane, and rank 8 experts needed Heaven and Earth’s authorization to create something like that.

Noah could even gain a deeper understanding of those inscriptions after his enlightenment in the laws of space. The fact that the fabric of the world accepted those lines meant that Heaven and Earth agreed with their existence.

King Elbas could create invisible inscriptions, but those white lines were on a different level. Part of Noah’s conclusions came from that feature. King Elbas was the best inscription master in the world, so the white formations had to have a stronger backing.

"Castor, Rebecca, and Melissa have sent us to gather the human forces," Noah shouted before stopping in front of the white lines. "We have no ill intentions. Heaven and Earth have sent us to support the natives of this plane."

Harold wanted to give voice to a loud snort, but he suppressed his emotions. That wasn’t the time to oppose Noah. He had to wait for a decent opportunity if he still wanted to betray him.

The white lines soon dispersed, and a large watery tunnel appeared among the floating lake. Noah and Harold became able to see faint structures inside the water, but their attention soon went on the two liquid stage cultivators that came out of the defenses.

"I didn’t expect you to be so few," One of the leaders said. "Heaven and Earth have promised us strong warriors to fight this filthy threat." Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

"We divided ourselves to gather troops quickly," Noah explained while keeping his lies in check. "You are the first group of survivors on our path."

"Don’t look at me," The same leader exclaimed before pointing at the man next to him. "I’m just a humble servant. My troops call me Fog, but I’m nothing more than an expert ready to give his life for his Master."

Noah turned toward the other man at that point. Even his instincts could sense that the second leader was far stronger than his companion. The expert was a liquid stage cultivator, but his aura managed to make Noah feel in danger.

"I’m Otto," The second leader said while joining the conversation. "I believe you were talking about me."

Noah and Harold quickly cleared the misunderstanding. Otto’s aura was quite dangerous, so they preferred to deploy a peaceful approach at first.

"How did you survive here?" Noah asked while studying the inscribed map. "This shouldn’t be a strong lake. Did you find a weakness in the Devils?"

"No such thing," Otto replied. "We are blessed with the strongest warriors in the plane. My force has once been the bane of the entire human domain. Now we are nothing more than survivors trying to create an army that has the faint hope to defeat the Devils."

"Are you a servant of Heaven and Earth?" Noah asked to understand Otto’s political inclination.

Noah wouldn’t hesitate to attack, but he wanted to make sure that Otto’s forces belonged to his enemies. There was a slim chance that he could gather more followers, so he wouldn’t start a slaughter without knowing the experts’ position.

"I’ve become a true believer only recently," Otto laughed while patting his arm on his large c.h.e.s.t.

Otto was a tall man with short black hair and no beard. His eyes radiated a white light, but their irises were blue. They even had traces of purple, but Noah guessed that it came from the constant use of specific techniques.

"My law fuses with the very matter of the sky," Otto revealed. "I’ve always struggled to accept Heaven and Earth, but my path has led me into their realm."

The expert clearly wanted to become a hero for Heaven and Earth. Otto d.e.s.i.r.ed the power they hid, but he had to complete many missions before obtaining that reward.

"Can we see how the situation is inside?" Noah asked in the politest tone that he could muster.

"Of course," Otto exclaimed, and Fog turned to return inside the floating lake. Otto also followed him and gestured to the duo to come with him.

Noah and Harold entered the floating lake and expanded their consciousness. They could sense that the situation inside that structure wasn’t different from the previous. The various buildings only hid weaker cultivators.

’No point hesitating now,’ Noah thought before approaching Fog and Otto.

The unstable substance flowed inside his black vessels and empowered his physical strength. His fingers quickly arched, and a storm of singularities flew across the leaders.

An innate spell activated to protect Fog, but his ability shattered. The singularities ended up on his face, and death soon reached him.

Otto was different. He could sense even the slightest trace of life. His body moved on its own and made him dodge Noah’s attack.
