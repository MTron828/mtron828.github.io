Chapter 1625 - 1625. Offer

The envoys left, and one of the experts in Noah’s team escorted them outside of the domes. Instead, Noah and the others remained inside the training area and held a meeting to discuss that matter.

The experts had different opinions about that offer. Most of them agreed that the tunnel was a trap set by Heaven and Earth to take care of those who fought their system. However, the group couldn’t find common ground during the discussion.

Gloria had spoken the truth. The Immortal Lands didn’t offer much in their current state. The rank 8 experts in the gaseous stage could still find something interesting in those areas, but those approaching the liquid stage had already set their eyes on the windy regions.

The magical beasts’ domain and the various inheritances could keep them busy for a while, but they weren’t the best training methods for experts at that level. Noah and the others needed adventures to improve their existence. Their current options could only give them techniques and materials.

"Do we really care if it’s a trap or not?" King Elbas shouted. "I almost wish it was a plan set by Heaven and Earth. Overcoming that hindrance would make us stronger."

"You aren’t thinking about the Legion," Jordan complained. "We would lose a lot of power if many experts were to leave for this mission. The other organizations might use that chance to take everything we have obtained during the last years."

"It’s pointless to linger on these topics," Noah eventually said to put an end to that conversation. "We have organizations, but we are also existences who strive to reach the higher ranks. We need these adventures to grow and improve our power."

"Don’t tell me that you want to go there," Jordan asked.

"I’m considering it," Noah explained. "Gloria is right. I have nothing to do until my battle prowess reaches the ninth rank. Long periods in seclusion would only hurt my centers of power."

"It’s still better than jumping into an obvious trap!" Jordan shouted.

"I’m with you, my heir," Divine Demon exclaimed. "This peaceful life doesn’t suit me anyway."

"They only want to affect our power!" Jordan continued to complain. "We have finally become one of the strongest organizations in the Immortal Lands. Why would you throw this status away?"

"Boredom," Divine Demon replied.

"Curiosity," King Elbas added.

"Need for struggles," Noah continued.

"They aren’t completely wrong," Alexander sighed. "This peaceful lifestyle would affect our power anyway. We might as well invest it into this quest."

"Do you also support this?" Jordan asked while turning toward Alexander.

"Adventures are the main source of growth in the cultivation journey," Alexander explained. "You can’t ask experts to remain inside a cave forever. Everyone would reach the ninth rank otherwise."

"We have awakened a rank 9 existence to obtain this peace," Jordan sighed and began to massage her temples.

"Jordan has a point," Noah eventually said. "We shouldn’t send too many experts into the mission. Only the strongest among us should go."

"How do you plan to find that out?" King Elbas asked.

"Let’s hold a tournament among those who want to go into the tunnel.," Noah explained. "The winners will get the chance to join Gloria and her group for the mission."

Noah’s solution met a few complaints, but the other experts couldn’t have much to say on the matter. None of them had the power to force other existences to remain in the Outer Lands. Those missions were necessary for the cultivation journey in the end.

The various rank 8 experts soon spread the news about the imminent tournament, and the rest of the Legion prepared a suitable battlefield.

King Elbas created a few sensors and placed them into regions outside of the blue lands. The battles wouldn’t happen inside the domes, so the experts could go all-out without worrying about the consequences of their actions.

Noah soon created a series of rules. He wanted to keep everything simple, but he also desired to leave the weaker experts outside the mission.

Those who managed to win at least one battle would gain the chance to join the mission. The fights also had to happen among experts with similar battle prowess to set an even ground where everyone had a chance to defeat their opponents.

The rules even put limits on those who could join the event. Sending rank 7 experts into the mission was mere suicide, so Noah restricted the tournament to existences in the eighth rank.

Crowds of hybrids, cultivators, and magical beasts gathered under the domes and at the battlefield’s borders to inspect the imminent fights. Their leaders were about to have friendly challenges, so the underlings didn’t dare to miss them.

Only those interested in joining the mission gathered on the battlefield. Noah, Divine Demon, King Elbas, Luke’s team, and the others from the Balrow family left the domes to search for contestants, but Noah stepped forward before any of them could say anything.

"I want to join the exploration," Noah announced to the small group in those lands. "I’ll be the first to fight."

Silence spread through the group, but an expert quickly stepped forward. King Elbas wore an arrogant smile, and battle intent leaked out of his figure. He seemed almost unable to contain his desire to fight Noah.

"I’m not surprised about this," Noah laughed while the other experts left the area to gather at the edges of the battlefield.

"We have to settle this score," King Elbas replied. "We have to understand who is stronger."

"My body is in the middle tier," Noah added. "I have the upper hand here." FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

"That’s what makes it so interesting," King Elbas announced. "I want to see how far my power stretches."

The tournament didn’t feature any signal that marked the beginning of the fights. They were all friends there. They could find a way to keep things fair.

"You can deploy your puppets," Noah said while wearing a mocking smile.

"You can try to jump toward me as fast as you can," King Elbas replied. "I want to see what you can do in the middle tier."

Noah didn’t let King Elbas’ words affect his tactic, but he still shot forward. His figure transformed into a black blade that reached his opponent in an instant.

King Elbas limited himself to smile, and his expression didn’t change even when Noah punched his shoulder. Pure golden flames spread through the environment as his body part exploded.

"You shouldn’t underestimate me so much," King Elbas said as a tinge of arrogance flowed inside his words. "Try launching deadly attacks. We both know that I’m hard to kill."

"I’d rather avoid it," Noah explained while the golden flames flew into the distance. "I don’t want to kill you by mistake."

"You should try to survive first," King Elbas laughed as an army of fiery puppets filled the battlefield.

King Elbas’ figure reappeared behind the army of gaseous stage puppets, but Noah shot through them. Those creatures couldn’t even begin to stop him.

Noah reached King Elbas’ new position and threw another punch, but the expert transformed before he could experience his first. His flames flew toward the distance again and allowed his puppets to surround him.
