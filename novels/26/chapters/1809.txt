The large patch of void hovered under the sky and blocked its radiance. Noah, Divine Demon, and Sword Saint bathed in one of the rare nights experienced in the higher plane.

The darkness felt comfortable. The light hurt their eyes and forced their minds to endure constant pressure, but the blackness of the void gave them peace. It allowed them to relax and rest their eyes.

It didn’t matter that the experts had just come back from a long journey inside the void. The situation felt completely different while inside the Immortal Lands. They could sense the light existing somewhere else, but they didn’t care. The world gave off a peaceful sensation, and the three experts let it seep inside them.

"You are quite the calamity," Sword Saint commented while raising his long eyebrows to inspect the vast patch of void. "Space with sharpness can be deadly."

"I just decided to destroy everything since I didn’t know how to kill the monster," Noah explained. "My effectiveness against Heaven and Earth’s laws did the rest."

"You ruined my challenge," Divine Demon complained.

"You were about to ruin me," Sword Saint snorted.

"How did I end up babysitting others?" Noah sighed. "I thought the whole point of having an organization was to have others babysitting me."

"I hurt him," Divine Demon continued. "I won the challenge."

"You tried to ruin my law to win," Sword Saint exclaimed.

"A victory remains a victory," Divine Demon announced while waving an arm to perform a haughty gesture. "I’m the best swordsman in the entire higher plane."

"I think I understand Elbas now," Sword Saint commented.

"It’s your fault for familiarizing with us," Noah explained. "You should have remained in the stormy regions."

Movements happened inside the patch of void while the experts cracked jokes and conversed. The last attack didn’t kill the monster. It had only sent it back to its natural habitat.

Noah had created a direct connection with the void that Heaven and Earth didn’t bother to fix. The world didn’t even have the energy to make use of the laws in its space, so the massive passage remained open and allowed the experts to inspect the events happening on the other side.

The monster soon reappeared in their vision. It hovered among the void as different empty creatures shot toward its figure and fused with its body.

The monster grew in size and developed different features. Horns and a tail materialized on its body, and its claws stretched to give it a devilish appearance.

"I bet you didn’t think this through," Sword Saint commented at that sight.

"The challenge is still on!" Divine Demon shouted happily.

"Both of you, shut up," Noah snorted while summoning Shafu.

The immense dragon materialized under Noah and opened its mouth to release part of the energy that it had absorbed during the journey through the void.

Noah quickly deployed the dark world and covered the entire patch before tinkering with that energy. The workshop activated, and his understanding of space filled his mind as he created materials that could fuse with the higher plane.

The process didn’t take much, but Sword Saint still grew slightly worried when he saw that the monster continued to grow. It would eventually decide to jump back into the higher plane and resume the battle, and he didn’t know if the second round would go as well as the first.

Divine Demon didn’t care much about the issue. The monster could give him the chance to prolong the challenge, so he didn’t mind its return. However, he understood the nature of the situation even with his crazy mind. Part of him only d.e.s.i.r.ed to go back to the black landmass and absorb the benefits amassed during the mission.

Noah ignored his surroundings as he built something that could solve the issue once and for all. The dark world slowly started to retreat and reveal that he had used a black patch to cover the passage to the void.

Noah had created a reinforced version of his space and had fused it with Heaven and Earth’s higher world to close the large opening and put an end to the crisis.

His efforts didn’t stop there. The empty creatures could still pierce the sky since Heaven and Earth were allowing them to pass, so Noah had to create a defensive layer that could put an end to that event.

Of course, Noah didn’t bother to contact King Elbas to question him about the nature of the golden rock used to suppress the sky’s corrosive nature. He only added a threatening aura to the patch of dark matter that he would let hover under that part of the white layer.

The dark world retreated once Noah completed the process. A large area under the sky had become dark, and a black layer divided it from the whiteness.

Noah had fixed the world, but he had added a personal influence when he rebuilt part of it. That patch of black space contained his greed, so it might expand on its own one day.

The monster had disappeared, and empty creatures didn’t fly past the sky anymore. The black layer prevented those creatures from reaching the insides of the higher plane, and the powerful being had fallen in an unclear area of the void when Noah destroyed Heaven and Earth’s space. Even he didn’t know where it had remained stuck now that its way back had disappeared.

The Immortal Lands now had an area covered in the constant night. That patch of space tainted Heaven and Earth’s whiteness, but the light appeared unable to affect it.

The future didn’t appear too bright for the layer right under the sky. That structure was bound to fall due to the constant exposition to the purest form of whiteness inside the higher plane. It would soon crumble and potentially allow the empty creatures to seep past the white material, but Noah wouldn’t care at that point. They would have no reason to perform the crossing once the experts left.

"Problem solved," Noah laughed. "Heaven and Earth didn’t even send a Tribulation."

"You fixed space nicely," Sword Saint commented. "I think I’ll come here to cultivate from time to time. I missed the night."

"I missed it more than you!" Divine Demon shouted.

"Isn’t the competition over?" Noah asked. "I won. It’s time to celebrate back at home."

Sword Saint and Divine Demon dropped their squabbles as the companions returned inside Noah’s separate space. The group flew toward the black landmass at high speed, and a strange sight accompanied that scene.

It was clear that King Elbas and the others had returned already. The trio could see entire groups of magical beasts and solid stage experts gathered at the edges of the landmass. They didn’t seem to do much. Most of them were simply busy cultivating.

The trio’s return didn’t go unnoticed, and Noah also saw how a series of pillars had appeared among the areas meant for the magical beasts. Those structures were quite crude and lacked many inscriptions, but Noah recognized some of the names written on their surface.

The pillars seemed to exist as a reminder of those who had tried to rebel. They carried details about the previous leaders of the ploys and the gruesome causes of their deaths.
