Chapter 1601 1601. Copy

Noah’s group could skip most of the trials. They could search for the various secret passages and reach the most challenging part of the fifth layer since the hidden area was probably there.

However, the quality of the rewards had made them decide to invest time in clearing the whole inheritance. The battle formation found after the battle against the scaled sphere was only the last of the many valuable resources obtained in the process.

The weakest part of the army took a break from the trials to learn the battle formation, and King Elbas joined those assets to modify the technique.

Great Builder had already modified that formation back in the days, but he didn’t adapt it to the different species of the higher plane. Noah’s army featured hybrids and magical beasts, so King Elbas had to change something in the technique’s structure to make the best out of those lines.

The other experts continued exploring the fifth layer while the rest of the army trained. Clearing the various defenses brought benefits to many powerful assets, and even experts like Wilfred managed to obtain something valuable.

King Elbas valued everything connected to the inscription field. Wilfred found a martial art that could match his existence after a few modifications. Jordan obtained disposable weapons that suited her law, and the list continued for most of the powerful assets in the army.

Only Divine Demon and Noah struggled to find something perfect for them. The former’s law was too unique to rely on items and techniques, and Noah’s standards were so high that even middle tier resources failed to meet his requirements.

That eventually changed as the army approached the last trials of the fifth layers.

The exploration became smoother after the weaker assets mastered the battle formation and managed to provide proper assistance during the fight.

Great Builder’s trials were smart and managed to ignore the difference in numbers most of the time. Still, having more power at their disposal improved the army’s overall experience.

Clearing harder trials led to better rewards, and Divine Demon eventually added himself to the list of experts who had benefitted from the inheritance. He found a technique that could temporarily improve his mental capabilities, and he quickly added it to the few abilities in his memory.

Only Noah remained unsatisfied at that point, but the pyramid eventually managed to give him something decent. He found a spell of the earth element that seemed similar to the workshop.

’This place mostly has resources,’ Noah thought while inspecting the diagram of the rank 8 spell. ’Techniques are rare, but they are quite decent.’

The spell resembled a weaker version of the workshop. It allowed the user to morph metals and ground to create almost everything.

’Maybe, Great Builder obtained the idea behind the workshop from this spell,’ Noah thought while studying the diagram.

Noah couldn’t use the spell in its current state, but he could add it to his arsenal by shattering and rebuilding the diagram according to his existence.

In his mind, Noah didn’t plan to turn the spell into one of his main weapons. He already had the workshop and incredible abilities, so that new technique would be redundant. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Still, Noah could turn it into a passive ability, a technique that could improve all the crucial roles played by the black hole.

Noah used the black hole to create special darkness meant for Miss Void’s spell. The organ also handled the production of Night’s food. It had many tasks at hand, and they often put limits on Noah’s power.

Instead, transforming that diagram into something that could improve his organ’s performance might remove some of the limits on his stronger abilities. Increasing the production of special darkness already made the spell a decent asset to add to his arsenal.

Noah immediately began to work on that project while his group continued to clear defenses. He never stopped helping with the trials, but he slowed down on his constant training to complete the transformation of that ability as soon as possible.

Great Builder’s pyramid didn’t offer Noah anything else even after the group reached the last area. Noah had begun to consider that trend quite normal after spending years inside the fifth layer. He had also started to understand the mindset of that great expert, which he had been unable to do during his first visit.

Rank 9 existences were complete monsters. They could seize anything in the world and create masterpieces that could remain with them forever.

The greatest limitation of those existences was their inability to ignore their laws when handling techniques and spells. They were both too personal since their creators had made them for themselves.

That was one of the reasons why Great Builder’s pyramid mostly contained resources. The Balrow family didn’t consider it an inheritance due to the nature of trials and rewards, but Noah almost justified the expert in his mind.

Great Builder’s law was quite clear. He had the workshop, the pyramid, and all the puppets inside that environment. Noah wouldn’t find anything about blades there, but he was fine with that since it depended on the expert’s power. Having found a suitable spell already surpassed his expectations.

"What do you think it is?" Noah asked while King Elbas studied the corridor before the last room.

"Hard to say," King Elbas replied while shaking his head. "I can only see sensors on the walls. The pyramid might start the test as soon as it understands how dangerous we are."

"You all speak too much," Divine Demon snorted while taking a step forward and entering the corridor. "It’s not a challenge if we spend more time planning the trial than clearing it."

The sensors inspected Divine Demon, and materials slowly seeped out of the wall. Black metals gathered in the corridor and gave birth to a puppet that radiated Divine Demon’s aura.

The copy was almost perfect. It even carried Divine Demon’s iconic law, and that sight made everyone worry.

The copies could surpass the original if the latter didn’t have trump cards. The precious materials used to create that puppet would make it surpass humans in terms of physical strength.

The hybrids didn’t fear that outcome. They even desired to test themselves. Instead, the situation was far worse for humans since they lacked the physical strength and resilience of those metal copies.

"Nothing in the world can imitate me!" Divine Demon snorted before unfolding his aura and turning his surroundings into azure energy.

The copy did the same, and a dark-yellow light soon gathered around it. The puppet even managed to steal part of the energy amassed by Divine Demon.

Divine Demon didn’t let that sight scare him. He raised his hand, and his copy imitated him. They both condensed their power until they gave birth to higher energy.

The two halos turned white before shooting toward their opponent. The attacks exploded as soon as they clashed, and a shockwave spread through the entire corridor.

A white light blinded Noah’s group for a while, but they eventually saw a fainted Divine Demon on the walls of their area. The puppet was still standing, and that was enough to declare the strongest among them.
