It took Noah a while to understand that King Elbas’ slash wasn’t invisible. The blood that came out of his forearm had taken fire during the attack and had created flames so fast that none of the rank 5 cultivators on the scene could see them.

The net made of lightning bolts fell apart once a fissure spread on its surface. Its orange sparks dispersed in the air as the links crumbled. Still, cracks continued to appear in that area of the sky even after the spell was gone.

The slash even severed the titan’s arm, which fell on the ground, creating another series of earthquakes. Ravaging Demon had managed to escape from its grip before it hit the terrain, and he had transformed in a series of flames that flew toward King Elbas.

Chasing Demon acted and controlled the giant so that its mouth would aim for the escaping flames. The insides of the titan started to tremble at that point. A condensed shockwave came out of its mouth in the form of a low cry, which reached its target instantly.

The trails of flames shook when the cry hit them. Most of them struggled to resist that attack only to disperse in the air. The fire that survived condensed into Ravaging Demon’s figure, which had many missing body parts.

Both his arms were nowhere to be seen, and he only had his left leg. Half of his waist had disappeared too, and all his injuries leaked massive quantities of blood even if his "Breath" tried to close them.

Also, no flames appeared to rebuild his missing parts. Ravaging Demon was bleeding for the first time since the beginning of the battle, and he didn’t seem able to suppress his injuries!

The offensive against him didn’t stop there. Great Elder Diana pointed both her indices toward the wounded Demon, and small sparks came out of them. That attack consisted of minute lightning bolts capable of flying even faster than King Elbas’ slash.

Holes appeared on Ravaging Demon’s body as the lightning bolts hit him. The pressure caused by that relentless offensive forced him to perform evasive maneuvers. Still, they only managed to limit the amount of damage that the Patriarch of the Council could inflict.

Those lightning bolts were too fast and small. Ravaging Demon couldn’t dodge them even in his flame form, and King Elbas’ attacks weren’t precise enough to intercept that offensive.

The Council and the Hive were finally gaining the upper hand in that battle. After all, they only wanted to secure the kill on Ravaging Demon in that situation. As for King Elbas, they could think of a way to deal with him in the future.

However, King Elbas didn’t want to lose his ally. Ravaging Demon was only a newly advanced rank 6 cultivator. Still, his sole presence could help him balance the political environment that was bound to appear once the factions returned to their homes.

King Elbas sighed for the third time, and an orb appeared next to him. The sphere emitted a multicolored light whose brightness flickered continuously. It could radiate the brightest white light before turning into a black radiance that obscured the area around it.

"I hope you are worth it," King Elbas said as he glanced at the escaping Ravaging Demon before launching the orb toward the center of those regions. The light radiated by the sphere became unstable during its flight until it burst outward, enveloping the entirety of the battlefield with its chaotic aura.

Great Elder Diana didn’t think much about the orb at the beginning. King Elbas didn’t throw it at her, so she continued to focus on the new powerhouse before it managed to escape.

Yet, she started to lose control of her spells after the chaotic aura spread through the sky. She would still launch her attacks, but they became imprecise and messy when they tried to aim for Ravaging Demon.

Great Elder Diana retracted her indices at that point and shot an angry glance at King Elbas before shouting words that echoed through the entire area. "Since when did you study my individuality?"

King Elbas laughed, seeing that his creation had managed to incapacitate the second-strongest powerhouse of those Mortal Lands. His aura surged as his bloodline gained more importance due to that achievement.

Of course, a normal inscribed item couldn’t stop a rank 6 cultivator. The orb was a disposable weapon in the sixth rank built only to counter Great Elder Diana’s precise lightning bolts.

King Elbas had begun to create countermeasures to the other powerhouses since the battle against the quasi-rank 7 winged beast. The data gathered in that fight had given him a clearer idea of the abilities of the other rank 6 cultivators and made it easier to create something that could weaken their individualities.

Great Elder Diana’s greatest strength was the precision of her lightning bolts. Cultivators with a lightning aptitude wouldn’t be able to control their attacks most of the time due to the intrinsic wildness of their element. Yet, the powerhouse of the Council had turned that weakness her iconic ability.

King Elbas had built an item that unleashed a chaotic aura in the environment, creating an area where Great Elder Diana couldn’t make use of her troublesome abilities. That chaos would affect even other cultivators, but they would apply harsher restrictions only on Diana’s individuality.

Ravaging Demon had never stopped moving, and he had continued to fly toward King Elbas even during the detonation of the multicolored orb. However, when he was about to reach his ally, the titan released another cry.

Ravaging Demon’s body was a mess. Blood leaked from the missing pieces of flesh and the holes created by the minute lightning bolts. The dense shockwave made him puke blood when it swept him, and even his consciousness wavered after that last attack.

The loss of focus put a stop to his flight and made him fall. The Demon wasn’t unconscious, but he struggled to fend off the effects of the shockwave.

Chasing Demon waved his hand, and the titan started to run toward the falling Demon. Its feet eventually stepped on the air, making it sprint in a diagonal trajectory through the sky as it tried to intercept its target.

King Elbas’ complexion paled at that point, and a single drop of black blood came out of his mouth. He then picked the blood and flicked it toward the giant, hitting it right before it could punch the falling Demon.

Flames spread through the entirety of the titan’s body when the black blood touched it. That fire appeared able to affect its massive form since the rocky terrain that made it turned into lava that fell toward the ground.

The giant cried again as if expressing its unwillingness to fall apart before it could complete its task. However, King Elbas’ flames were too powerful and liquefied its entire body before it could reach Ravaging Demon.

Chasing Demon’s attack died with its arm stretched in a desperate attempt to reach its target.
