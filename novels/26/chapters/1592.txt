Chapter 1595 1595. Curse

The golem, the swarm of bees, and Noah’s group advanced through the regions until they reached a small city called Solma. The settlement only had two rank 8 cultivators, but it featured countless defenses that instantly activated at the sight of the massive threat.

"The human domain will never forgive us for this," Jordan transmitted through her consciousness.

Radiant Eyes’ aura didn’t spread outside of the titan, but the bees could still hear Noah’s group. The experts had resorted to their consciousness to speak, but they limited those interactions as much as possible.

"We managed to bring the Balrow family to safety, luckily," Noah replied through his mental waves.

In theory, the human domain only featured enemies now. The mindless assault launched by Radiant Eyes wouldn’t hurt any of their friends. Noah and the others could avoid holding back and warning other forces.

The army of bees featured countless lower tier specimens, many creatures in the middle tier, and two leaders in the upper tier. The swarm was at the peak of the human domain in terms of power. Noah’s team didn’t have to worry about the outcome of their battles.

However, those experts still wanted to find ways to benefit from their situation. The bees would tell Radiant Eyes everything, so Noah’s team had to come up with something that could make them improve during those battles.

Noah and the others limited themselves to think those plans. They didn’t dare to test them before knowing how those bees acted in the outside world.

The bees didn’t hesitate to shoot toward the city as soon as they confirmed the presence of cultivators. Noah’s team followed them, but they let those creatures act as cannon fodder during the first part of the assault.

The human domain had deployed most of its reinforcement against Alexander, who was attacking regions far away from Noah’s position. They wouldn’t have the time to return in time, especially since most of the teleports were around big cities.

Multicolored shields and various defensive mechanisms tried to fend off the bees’ assault. Lightning bolts, massive arrows, and large fiery boulders cut through the swarm, but they only managed to kill or injure the weaker creatures.

The bees in the middle and upper tier could hold their ground against those protections. The two leaders even destroyed the shields in few attacks, so the assault soon turned into a slaughter.

Those magical beasts weren’t smart. Most of them were newborns that had yet to develop their bodies completely.

The two rank 8 cultivators tried to escape once the defenses fell, and the bees didn’t bother to chase them. They had countless rank 7 cultivators in front of them, so they barely noticed the duo running away.

Instead, Noah and the others knew how to handle that situation better. Noah quickly teleported in front of the two escaping experts and blocked their retreat while Divine Demon and Jordan chased after them.

"You are a curse!" One of the experts shouted when he recognized Noah.

The two experts were gaseous stage cultivators. One of them was from the Monneay family, while the other belonged to the Sailbrird family. They were both quite important in the political environment of the human domain, but they were nothing more than targets in Noah’s eyes. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Noah glanced at the swarm behind his targets before focusing on the two experts again. He suppressed a roar when the unstable substance entered his black veins and shot forward to secure a quick kill.

The cultivators deployed their best abilities. Dense mental waves created an ethereal barrier, and potions exploded in the area to give birth to toxic clouds.

Noah drew the Demonic Sword and summoned Duanlong to weaken those abilities. The dragon took care of a large chunk of the toxic clouds before Noah slammed on the ethereal barrier.

The dense mental waves tried to seep into Noah’s mind and alter his thoughts, but that technique didn’t manage to do much against him. Noah had opposed his bloodlust since he obtained the cursed sword. That influence succeeded in slowing him down, but it only delayed the inevitable.

Noah filled the area with dark flames that burnt the mental waves and what remained of the toxic clouds. Duanlong handled the remaining energy lingering in the sky, and two figures soon appeared in the distance.

The two cultivators had used that chance to escape again, but Noah quickly caught up with them. The experts were slower than him even if he didn’t rely on his teleports.

Mental waves and red pills flew toward Noah, but he teleported before they could touch him. He reappeared above the expert from the Sailbrird family, and his blade promptly descended toward his opponent.

Both cultivators activated their defensive measures. Mental waves seeped into the world and transformed its fabric into a crystallized wall. Poison also spread through the area and created a dark-green barrier that the air couldn’t withstand.

Noah didn’t interrupt his attack. His blade continued to descend until it crashed on the poisonous barrier. A fissure eventually opened in that defense, and a singularity continued to fly until it pierced the crystals.

Noah could finally see the two experts again and his hand shot before they could rely on other defensive measures. Black roots came out of his palm and crossed the barrier until they reached the cultivator from the Sailbrird family.

The expert’s skin became dark-green and began to radiate a corrosive aura that fought the roots. Still, the Demonic Form managed to keep him in the same position for an instant, and Noah didn’t hesitate to exploit that chance.

Noah performed a thrust that launched a precise singularity. That invisible energy crossed the fissure and made the expert’s head vanish.

A wave of flames then came out of Noah’s mouth while he glanced behind him. The bees were still busy collecting rank 7 cultivators, so he could exploit one of the many loopholes in Radiant Eyes’ orders.

The fire burnt the headless corpse and forced the second expert to escape. Noah didn’t hesitate to chase after him, but a white beam soon pierced the sky and blocked the cultivator’s path.

More flames also covered the area. Jordan and Divine Demon had finally reached that part of the battlefield, which left the cultivator alone against two monsters and a dragon.

"The Monneay family will reward you if you spare me now," The expert shouted. "I serve no purposed as dead. You can use me as a consultant if you need it.

"Can’t you see what is happening?" Noah laughed while shooting forward and grabbing the expert’s neck. "A rank 9 existence is roaming through these lands. The old rules don’t apply anymore."

"Please!" The expert pleaded, but Noah pierced his low-waist before he could continue.

Dark matter quickly covered the expert’s dantian and sent its energy back to the black hole. Noah then crushed the cultivator’s neck and stored everything in his separate space.

The bees didn’t sense anything. They even rejoiced when they saw Noah throwing the corpse toward the titan, which disappeared as soon as it touched those scarlet rocks.

’This might even work better than I expected,’ Noah thought while the bees finished gathering corpses to throw at the titan. ’I expect these creatures to improve, but it doesn’t hurt to exploit this situation for the time being.’
