Chapter 1706 - 1706. Winged

The black hole had absorbed enough energy during the fight to take care of the drawbacks and suppress most of their adverse effects. Noah only felt a faint weakness, but he could fight as usual.

’Using my ambition again will only cause injuries,’ Noah thought as his attention moved between his body and the battlefield.

The three solid stage cultivators that had remained on Heaven and Earth’s side didn’t use any special item. They were using weaker laws for the time being since they had to disperse Noah’s influence from their opponents’ aura. Still, it wouldn’t take much before they could rely on their real power.

The fact that Lady Phyllis had died didn’t go unnoticed. Heaven and Earth’s army could sense that Noah had come out of the hole on his own. No light tried to reach that spot either. The rulers didn’t have anything to resurrect there.

A vague idea had formed inside Noah’s mind after the battle with Lady Phyllis. The quick dispersion of his drawbacks fused with his violent thoughts had given birth to a ruthless plan that he could deploy as long as the fight didn’t oppose him.

’It’s pointless to win for my allies,’ Noah thought as his eyes darted among the various battles.

The experts in the sky would all join his organization once they reached the other side of the Immortal Lands. Noah didn’t want to fill his force with useless cultivators, but the mission didn’t allow him to lose too many troops. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

’I guess a little help won’t ruin everything,’ Noah sighed in his mind. ’Many of them will die in one of the next crazy plans anyway.’

Noah shot in the sky and ignored the various battles to reach the solid stage cultivators. The army only had three of them left, but only Robert was managing to suppress one of them.

The Foolery and Divine Demon were taking care of another solid stage cultivator, and the same went for Wilfred and King Elbas. That disposition wasn’t casual since the experts had chosen to send the most resilient of them toward the cultivator that they couldn’t kill.

The cultivators moved away when they saw Noah flying right through the battlefield. A path opened among the army and brought him directly next to Robert.

The expert had just dodged a massive winged fireball. The attack curved mid-air and tried to fly back at him, but invisible energy engulfed it and made it disappear.

"I didn’t need your help," Robert snorted.

"I didn’t do that to help you," Noah explained while arriving next to the expert. "I’ll take it from here. You should help the others."

Robert didn’t complain since the situation didn’t allow them to waste time, but he still shot a curious glance toward Noah. The latter seemed too calm. It was clear that he had something in mind.

"Your confidence is disarming," Robert’s opponent announced from the edges of the battlefield.

The solid stage expert had the aspect of a middle-aged man with long black hair a pair of green eyes. He was quite slender, and patches of charred skin covered his body.

His appearance was quite peculiar for an expert at that level. It was rare for a cultivator in the eighth rank to carry such evident injuries, especially for someone who could rely on Heaven and Earth’s miraculous healing abilities.

"I’m Lord Ethan," The man announced while performing a polite bow. "I can’t wait to face the great Noah Balvan."

"You don’t have to put up this pretense to hide your fear," Noah sighed. "I’ve just killed your leader. You don’t have inscribed items meant to counter my abilities either. I’ll accept your surrender if you are smart enough to acknowledge the difference between our power."

"Arrogant little shit," Lord Ethan said in a low tone while forsaking his polite expression.

"You had your chance," Noah laughed, and his ambition expanded to cover the entire battlefield.

The influence that Heaven and Earth’s army had fought for so long to disperse returned stronger than ever. Noah gave the Devils’ abilities to his companions. The enemy cultivators suddenly found themselves forced to switch to weaker laws, and their opponents didn’t let that opening go to waste.

"How long do you think it will take to Heaven and Earth to counter this ability?" Lord Ethan asked. "This power comes from the anger of a weaker world. It’s only normal for a superior plane to suppress it."

Noah had already stopped listening to Lord Ethan. The dark world expanded from his figure as two blades appeared in his hands. A fiendish armor covered his skin, and black roots spread above his body. The companions also left the black hole and prepared for the imminent battle.

Lord Ethan snorted when the wave of dark matter tried to engulf his figure. Flames amassed above his skin and gave birth to a series of winged fireballs that began to devour Noah’s technique.

The dark world didn’t manage to touch Lord Ethan, but a shadow suddenly materialized next to him. Noah waved his blades, and a large chunk of the area vanished.

Noah’s singularity made everything disappear, be it air, "Breath", or spells. Even the few cultivators that had been too slow to leave the area died due to his massive attack.

Lord Ethan didn’t have specific items to counter Noah’s abilities, but he knew them well. He had developed techniques that could counter them, so the singularity didn’t take him by surprise.

One of Lord Ethan’s winged fireballs had flown out of the range of the singularity. The mass of fire morphed until it took the expert’s shape, and a loud laugh soon came out of his mouth.

"You must be quite exhausted after killing Lady Phyllis," Lord Ethan commented. "Don’t worry. I’ll go easy on you."

Noah revealed a cold smile before placing both blades on his forehead. Pieces of his torso had vanished due to the cursed sword, but he didn’t hesitate to attack again.

A chill ran down Lord Ethan’s spine when a wave of sharpness spread along with Noah’s consciousness. His figure separated to give birth to multiple winged fireballs that flew in different directions, but only a few of them managed to escape the threatening attack.

Lord Ethan reformed at some distance in the sky. His hand quickly went to grab a patch of charred flesh. The expert tore it apart to release a wave of denser scarlet flames that took the shape of a large creature.

The scene left Noah slightly surprised. Three massive fireballs had fused through scarlet channels, and two pairs of fiery wings grew from their side.

The creature didn’t seem much different from the previous winged fireballs, but it carried enough power to alert Noah’s instincts. It didn’t matter that it radiated weaker laws. Lord Ethan had still summoned something capable of hurting Noah.

Waves of energy flew toward Noah as pieces of his dark world fused with his figure. The power acc.u.mulated in the battles inside his technique became part of his innate ability and partially healed his injuries.

The dark world was allowing his companions to obtain a few victories, and Night was flying through the technique to sever the dead from Heaven and Earth’s system. It was only normal for Noah to take his share of energy due to his role.

"I won’t let you heal!" Lord Ethan suddenly shouted when he understood what was happening.

A fourth sphere gathered at the center of the creature’s structure before a scarlet beam shot toward the dark world behind Noah. The expert didn’t care that he could hurt his companions in the process. He only wanted to stop the technique.

The beam lost part of its power as a massive mouth came out of the dark world and applied a pulling force to its structure. A giant snake also flew out of the black sea and sent a few black feathers to block the attack.

The impact with the beam ended up destroying a part of the dark world anyway, but Noah could use that chance to land above the creature and sever its structure in half.
