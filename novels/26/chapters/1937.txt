Chapter 1938 1938. Resul

Supreme Thief’s ability felt like the obvious choice in Noah’s project to deepen the aspects of his laws. He wouldn’t be able to use the actual stealing skill during the process, but he wouldn’t need it anymore afterward since it would belong to his existence.

Moreover, Supreme Thief’s ability affected only the aspects of his law, not the actual ambition. Greed, pride, and hunger were part of his true meaning, but not its foundation.

Noah would prefer to affect his ambition only after gaining a bit of experience in the process and confirming once more that everything was working well. Also, approaching Isaac’s ability would be far easier after he gained access to the entirety of Supreme Thief’s understanding.

Yet, the decision had a completely different perspective that involved the depth of the understanding of those abilities. Isaac was a mere rank 8 cultivator in the solid stage who had joined Heaven and Earth’s system. Instead, Supreme Thief was a rank 9 monster who had been able to come back to life. The difference between their power was immense, which would definitely affect the procedure, especially in its length.

Truth be told, Noah wasn’t even sure he could absorb Supreme Thief’s ability into his existence without affecting himself due to the difference in understanding. His greed, pride, and hunger might change into something that his ambition didn’t accept if he let the process transform those aspects, and Noah didn’t want to end up like Heaven and Earth.

The procedure already carried inherent risks, and Noah wasn’t famous for his safe approaches. Still, he had to put limits in front of him when it came to such important parts of his journey. One mistake would ruin his path forever. He would see millennia of struggles falling apart in mere seconds.

’Isaac it is,’ Noah eventually concluded. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The choice didn’t bother Noah too much since Isaac’s ability was incredibly similar to his ambition. They actually appeared to be born from the same core idea.

His ambition could amass potential capable of boosting the level of every aspect of his existence after he succeeded in an incredible feat. Noah’s existence wasn’t only that, especially when it came to the influence that he could spread in the environment and the benefits received by those around him, but its core ability remained the empowerment.

Isaac was similar. His existence founded its power on the enemies he defeated and created an energy that could boost most of his attacks. It worked as a limited version of the ambition’s potential, and Noah found fusing them quite reasonable.

The effects that two different abilities would usually lead to something inferior to the power that a single superior technique could generate. The issue was in the conflicting properties between the skills. It didn’t matter how similar they were. A few features would always differ, and that alone would cause problems.

’I wonder how strong my ambition can become after this,’ Noah thought as he prepared his mind for the process.

Noah didn’t even need to think about the preparations that his mind needed. He had completed so many experiments and mental battles in that ethereal environment that the dark matter almost acted on its own after entering his center of power to provide its help.

The process was quite important for Noah. Deepening his aspects and absorbing new abilities were almost a necessity in his mind. Still, the part regarding his ambition was far more significant, not only because it was the core, foundation, and authentic expression of his existence.

His potential would play a crucial part in making his dantian reach the intended level that surpassed what his talent and accumulation wanted it to obtain. Increasing the quality of that power would slow down his future advancements, but it would also give him a stronger fuel that would help in his main project.

Noah activated Supreme Thief’s ability, but he didn’t immediately focus on Isaac’s skill. He let the dark matter accumulated inside his mind copy the properties of the azure light and enhance its effects.

The dark matter didn’t take much to complete the task. It even managed to isolate the properties of the mental walls to make sure that the process was a smooth as possible. After all, Supreme Thief’s technique targeted abilities, not existences, so Noah had to keep the light active and dig deeper into what he had stolen to obtain what he wanted. The understanding was everything.

Azure light shone on the ethereal area isolated by the dark matter. Intense greed seeped out of Noah’s figure as his concentration reached its peak.

The piece of Isaac’s existence that caused its ability slowly melted and fell on the radiant barrier of dark matter. Pure understanding tried to fuse with Noah’s higher energy, but he let it pass and reach the mental sea downward.

Noah immediately felt hot. His dantian churned, sweat appeared on his body, and the black hole started to rotate at full speed. His consciousness struggled to keep track of what was happening in his surroundings mental sphere. His entire existence felt dizzy as understanding poured inside his ambition and pride.

The pride’s aspect deepened. It gained understanding in areas that Noah had never studied since that feeling had always been deeply connected to his magical beasts’ side. Instead, he was gaining a similar power but expanded on the pure cultivator’s side, which gave Noah a complete view of the field.

Still, his existence shook whenever the drops of understanding fell on his ambition. Noah sensed a foreign force touching him deeply and giving him power as it tried to change what it was.

Isaac had based his ability on the rebels of Heaven and Earth’s system killed, while Noah had given it a broader purpose when he turned it into his technique. The dark matter purified that understanding further, but something belonging to the original meaning remained, so it obviously tried to fight or change Noah’s ambition.

However, Noah had access to a rank 9 mind. His mental sea started to radiate his intense pride and act as a second filter for Isaac’s understanding as soon as problems arrived.

Noah’s condition slowly stabilized as his existence managed to limit the effects of Isaac’s understanding to his potential. His ambition almost split to give more room to that energy, and the process eventually ended.

Deep breaths came out of Noah’s mouth as he inspected his body after he opened his eyes. He was fine. His figure didn’t change, his existence had also remained the same, and his centers of power were okay. He continued to feel dizzy, but the feeling came from his insides since everything had yet to adapt to the new state.

Noah even checked his potential. He initially remained surprised when he saw that it had shrunk, but he quickly understood the reason behind that event. His power didn’t diminish. That fuel had simply gained a denser state that expressed its new ability better.

’That’s also complete,’ Noah thought as he used part of his potential to empower a chunk of dark matter in his palm.

Noah recalled exactly how much potential his higher energy needed to reach its solid state, so he felt pleasantly surprised to confirm that the requirements had almost halved. He didn’t manage to multiply the effects of his ambition, but that result was already incredible.
