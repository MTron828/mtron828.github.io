Chapter 1604 1604. Easy

The winged lion had yet to launch a single attack. Noah’s team had kept the creature locked in a chain of techniques that had prevented every attempt to defend or react.

The existences in Noah’s army were experts in different fields, but they had been together for so long that they could cooperate perfectly. Moreover, their battle experience allowed them to adapt to any situation and unknown technique.

The winged lion had lost five legs and part of its right wing. The creature had suffered a decent number of injuries, but that didn’t weaken it in the slightest.

Three legs were more than enough to make it able to charge ahead. The winged lion had Noah and the other experts waiting for it on the floor, but it didn’t give them that satisfaction.

The creature’s legs cracked on the air before it performed a sharp turn. It was about to fall in Noah’s hands, but it suddenly shot toward the massive nine-headed hydra in the back of the room.

Divine Demon promptly appeared in its trajectory and slapped one of its three heads. The creature changed direction after the attack and slammed into an area that Noah and the others didn’t hesitate to reach.

A massive singularity shot toward the sixth leg. Jordan, Ian, and Wilfred joined that offensive until they severed the sixth limb from the main body.

Noah didn’t stop there. His body was a mess due to the drawbacks of the cursed sword. Also, his flames didn’t manage to burn much. Yet, he didn’t hesitate in front of a chance to inflict more damage.

The winged lion tried to stand up, but Noah arched his fingers and grabbed two heads to keep the creature stuck on the ground. A massive force landed on his arms and shoulders and threatened to rip them off, but the empowerment given by the unstable substance made him able to endure it for a few seconds.

His companions launched their best techniques while Noah kept the creature still. King Elbas even sent a few formations to help him in the task.

Divine Demon and Wilfred silently decided to join forces and focus their attacks on the same leg. The two experts flew toward their target and unleashed a flurry of punches that ended up crushing the limb.

As for the others, Jordan and Ian tried to take care of the last leg, but their level couldn’t amount to much. They had to accept that only Wilfred and Divine Demon wielded enough power to handle it. They could only support them in the task. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Noah let go of the winged lion, which didn’t immediately attack. The creature had to overcome Theodora’s suppression before it could decide to charge again, and King Elbas’ formations were still around its body.

Snore and Duanlong appeared next to the winged lion and began to suppress it. The snake entangled its massive body around the puppet’s figure, and the dragon spread its mouth to absorb all the energy that tried to flow through its opponent’s fabric.

Noah flew above one of the heads before thrusting both blades downward. The attack didn’t manage to pierce its metal skin, but it destabilized the creature enough to slam it on the floor.

Divine Demon and Wilfred used that chance to help Jordan and Ian. They shot toward the last leg and unleashed their attacks to crush it. The winged lion soon lost its last limb and found itself stuck on the floor.

Pearl, Luke, and the other human experts finally saw their chance to shine at that sight. The winged lion’s physical strength was too threatening for their frail body, but they could begin to approach it now that the hybrids had taken care of its ability to move freely.

Luke joined Theodora, and the duo applied a twofold restriction of the winged lion. Pearl and the other experts from the Balrow family helped King Elbas and followed his orders to deploy suitable inscriptions.

The army of magical beasts outside of the battle formation began to assault the defenseless puppet. The creature could only flap its left wing, so its opponents could ravage its right side.

The Foolery and the other magical beasts used all the power at their disposal to pierce that thick skin. Some even died while eating it due to the massive amount of energy inside that metal. Those creatures had the best prey in the world right in front of their eyes, but they couldn’t taste it properly.

Noah soon moved his focus on the heads. A sense of weakness had pervaded him after he stored the cursed sword, and his mind was already near its limit.

Noah deployed the entirety of his arsenal. He used the Demonic Form, the Demonic Sword, Night, Snore, Duanlong, the unstable substance, the dark world, and the draconic armor. However, there was a limit to how much he could achieve at his current level.

His attacks could only slam the winged lion’s heads to slam on the floor. They couldn’t pierce its skin nor force it to submit. It was clear that Noah was too out of place for that situation.

Divine Demon and Wilfred had different ideas. Their attacks could shatter the tough metal fabric of that creature, and removing its limbs had given them the chance to go all-out without incurring useless risks.

The duo felt that the fifth layer was their home. They had fought to the best of their potential and had succeeded. The pyramid was judging them worthy of getting Great Builder’s inheritance.

Of course, the last defense of Great Builder’s structure couldn’t be so easy. It didn’t matter that Noah had some of the best experts in the Immortal Lands. There had to be something else, and those suspicions eventually led to him.

"I don’t think I have time for a proper evaluation," Noah explained while supporting a missing piece of his skin and pretending that he didn’t suffer any injury.

"Give me something," Wilfred almost pleaded to receive additional information about his opponent.

"The battle should be over after we sever its heads," Noah commented. "Rip his wings off and see what happens. That amount of damage should be enough to trigger any hidden ability."

Wilfred didn’t hesitate to resume the battle. It didn’t take him much to seize the wing since he had hordes of cultivators, hybrids, and magical beasts supporting him.

Noah helped where he could. His attacks were almost useless, but they managed to change the trajectory of some of the creature’s attacks. The winged lion was dangerous even in that form, so his efforts saved many lives and stopped multiple attacks from reaching their destination.

White lines spread through the room after the experts severed the wings. They converged toward the lion and made its three fake cores shine. The heads began to radiate a white halo that almost blinded the opponent army.

After the halo dimmed, Noah felt a sudden surge of pain coming from his body. He had sensed an impact, but the situation was too strange to understand what had happened.

His senses soon gave him a general idea of what had happened during the outburst of white light. The winged lion had attacked everyone in its surroundings, and Noah was one of them.
