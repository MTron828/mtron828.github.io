Chapter 1803 - 1803. Strategies

The many complaints remained stuck in the experts’ minds after Noah’s announcement. Heaven and Earth had closed their path back inside the sky, and the situation appeared completely doomed, but Noah didn’t despair. He had even managed to come up with a solution in no time.

"Can Mortal Lands even endure our power?" Marina asked.

Marina was a native of the higher plane. She obviously knew about the Mortal Lands, but they had never concerned her too much. After all, spending time thinking about lower worlds was pointless unless an expert had a specific reason for that.

"No," King Elbas directly replied.

"They’ll probably start to fall apart as soon as one of us gets close," Noah continued. "I believe they’ll crumble if all of us were to enter the separate space that contains them."

The last revelation made the experts go back to their complaints. They suddenly realized that Noah had given birth to another crazy plan, and they cursed themselves for not understanding that part sooner.

A storm of complaints reached Noah’s mind, but he only rolled his eyes at that noise. He even felt annoyed by the seemingly intelligent suggestions of some of his friends.

In his mind, only a few of them had the right to speak about those topics since their expertise involved them. Noah knew space better than anyone in the group, King Elbas’ knowledge was almost boundless, and Alexander’s endless innate abilities gave him far more power than he realized.

Noah eventually gave voice to another roar and forced the group to fall silent. He wouldn’t have revealed his idea if he didn’t have a proper plan ready. He only needed to adjust a few details that his expertise didn’t cover.

"I need to speak with Elbas alone for a bit," Noah announced. "Those of you with understanding in the laws of space and evolution should join us. The others should remain here and try not to complain too much."

The group wanted to argue, but everyone remained silent since Noah and King Elbas were their best bet to get out of that situation. The complaints could arrive later, when they all returned inside the sky.

"What’s your crazy idea now?" King Elbas asked once the two separated from the rest of the group and used their auras to create an area where mental waves couldn’t enter. "I understand the idea behind your plan, but we are too powerful for the Mortal Lands. They’ll break before we can even step on them."

"I know," Noah sighed. "That’s why we need to transform them into Immortal Lands before stepping on them."

King Elbas showed a blank expression, but he couldn’t stop his eyes from opening in surprise. He had to admit that the idea had never managed to enter his mind.

"Think about it," Noah continued. "We have enough energy to recreate a large chunk of the higher plane. Transforming a weaker world should be even easier." nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

"Did you even consider the dimensional tunnel in your plan?" King Elbas asked. "Heaven and Earth created them for newly advanced divine experts. We are far away from that level."

"I did consider them," Noah laughed while patting King Elbas’ shoulder. "I explained the plan to you. You can solve that issue now."

King Elbas’ expression went blank again. Part of him started to hate Noah and his crazy plans, but the severity of the situation didn’t allow him to curse at his fate. He could review which choices had led him among those idiots after he saved his life.

"We need to perform many tests," King Elbas eventually said. "Do you plan on wasting the energy gathered in the mission to prolong our time here?"

"Do you have other options?" Noah laughed. "We even have to find suitable Mortal Lands afterward. Did you take note of the weaker worlds that we met on our path?"

"Of course," King Elbas snorted before taking out a map that depicted an oval white mass at its center and complete blackness everywhere else.

Noah could find many notes on the map when he inspected it with his mental energy. King Elbas had divided it into large sections that used symbols on the drawing of the white sky to create vague coordinates.

It was clear that creating an accurate map of the void was impossible due to the complete lack of reference points in that environment, but King Elbas had done a great job in reducing the errors to the minimum.

"Right," King Elbas suddenly said when placing a finger on the white oval.

Noah noticed how the hole marked on the map disappeared. King Elbas had just found the time to update it.

The map kept track of all the separate spaces that the group had met during their mission. Noah could see that many separate dimensions hidden in the void in the surrounding areas contained Mortal Lands that seemed suitable for the plan, but he didn’t want to take risks.

There was a high chance that the Mortal Lands in the area all converged toward the now closed hole. Noah guessed that the group had to move to distant quadrants to ensure that Heaven and Earth couldn’t mess with them.

"Pick one," Noah ordered at some point.

King Elbas scratched his chin before pointing at a quadrant that was quite distant from them and explaining his decision. "We found a Mortal Land that appeared quite resilient here. It might be easier to evolve."

Noah nodded before reminding him about his task. "Find a solution for the dimensional tunnels. It doesn’t have to be nice as long as it solves the issue. I’ll tell the plan to the others."

King Elbas sighed before taking out his massive mansion. The experts wore ugly expressions when they saw the golden structure unfolding in their eyes. It was clear Noah had decided to spend some time there, which meant that they had to use part of the energy acc.u.mulated in the last years.

It felt bad to see their efforts and achievements turning into mere fuel for inscribed items, but the experts couldn’t say anything when their survival was at stake. Even the four cultivators from the human organizations remained silent and waited for Noah to explain the nature of the plan.

"I know I’m famous for my crazy plans," Noah announced, and a series of suppressed comments immediately reached his mind. "However, this plan is the least crazy of all of them. We only have to transform a lower plane into a world on par with the Immortal Lands."

Blank expressions appeared on the experts’ faces. Even Noah’s friends couldn’t help but show how little they trusted his reassurances.

"The evolution is the easy part," Noah eventually continued. "You can leave that to me. The main issue is the dimensional tunnel. We need to travel through it until a hole appears in our vision, which means more than simple improvements. Still, Elbas is on it, so everything should be fine."

"What should we do?" Wilfred asked. "Do you want us to cultivate while you handle everything?"

"You get inside the mansion and do everything Elbas tells you to do," Noah snorted. "Everything should go smoothly, but I don’t want to take risks. Heaven and Earth have made their move already, but they might not be done."
