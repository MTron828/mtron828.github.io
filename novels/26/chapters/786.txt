’Once reached certain heights, every cultivator would see their "Breath" change shape and power according to their individualities.’ Noah read through the contents of the books. ’These changes are a natural consequence of the separation of the cultivators from Heaven and Earth. Their existence would become something outside of their plan until they eventually become laws.’

The Elders had left Noah alone after they listed all the gains. He had a few spells to inspect, but the research given by the Elbas family was too appealing to focus on anything else at the moment.

’However, the "Breath" is both a miraculous energy and a shackle that keeps the cultivators bound to Heaven and Earth. A real individuality would ultimately affect even the internal composition of that energy and change it into something entirely personal, but there are ways to quicken that process.’ Noah’s kept on reading, and his interest could only increase at those words.

The introduction of that research went through what was considered common knowledge among the existences in the higher ranks. The changes of the "Breath" and the separation from Heaven and Earth’s domain were events that anyone expressing their individuality could see.

Yet, the tomes continued exploring various possibilities, especially the creation of a higher form of energy.

’The "Breath" can be used as a material to build incredible items. So, it is theoretically possible to use it to create even stronger energy capable of improving the prowess of any cultivator drastically.’ Noah read as he wondered who was the author of those tomes.

There were detailed descriptions of the experiments and arrays tested by the expert that was pursuing those ideas. The writer had even noted down the peculiarities of the inscription method used and his mental state when he performed them.

The first book turned out to list a series of failures, only to conclude with a revelation. ’The behavior of the "Breath" depends too much on its element. It’s impossible to create a unified method.’

Noah hastily took the second book and resumed his read. ’I’ve found basic requirements for the higher energy of each element. In my case, I need to create a material able to give birth to stronger flames during the combustion. I’m still unclear on what I will use, but it’s a start.’

The author then listed another series of experiments, but they mostly targeted the nature of the "Breath" of the fire element, which didn’t interest Noah.

’I’ve found something that could work. I’m the best expert in the entirety of the Utra nation, and even the suppression of the Royal family can’t put a stop to my improvements. I know now that there is no better fuel than myself.’ Noah’s eyes widened when he read those lines.

The image of a man wearing a crown had appeared in his mind for a brief second. He was starting to suspect that the nameless author was, in fact, King Elbas!

Notes filled the rest of the tome. They didn’t describe experiments, but they reported random thoughts and brief moments of inspiration that the author had decided to put down as he kept researching.

The third and last book described the approach that a cultivator should have in the creation of higher energy according to each element.

According to the author, there was a specific behavior to each element that the cultivators had to exploit. Fire needed materials to burn, water needed density, wind needed perpetual motion, earth needed a foundation, and lightning required friction.

However, when it came to the light and darkness elements, the author couldn’t identify a specific behavior, which forced him to give up on creating a method for those elements.

’Theoretically speaking, cultivators with light and darkness aptitude should be able to create higher energy that fits their individualities in ways that the other elements can’t. The rarest elements don’t have a fixed state and can contain any kind of behavior. I wouldn’t be surprised if they could recreate the same matter of the world.’ Noah closed the last book at those lines.

The research didn’t tell him how to create higher energy with his element, but it gave him an idea and the certainty that it was possible. Most of the time, those two factors were all the things that an expert needed to achieve what he wanted.

’Is this the reason behind King Elbas’ power?’ Noah questioned himself. ’What a monster.’

He couldn’t help but respect the powerhouse of the Royal family even more after that discovery. After all, he was a cultivator that had managed to create an entirely new branch of the cultivation journey!

Of course, Noah couldn’t be sure that the author was King Elbas, but there were too many coincidences for him not to link the two of them.

’I’ve focused on the primary energy so much that I lingered on creating a stronger version of the "Breath" rather than outclassing it.’ Noah thought as he read the books once again.

There were many aspects of the cultivation world that most humans ignored due to their species. One of them was the existence of the primary energy since it was something limited to the magical beasts’ world.

Noah found himself in the same spot, even if in the opposite position. He had never considered the possibility that there were forms of energy more powerful than the "Breath" and that the cultivators could build them.

’The primary energy is like sand, while the particles of "Breath" are bricks.’ Noah thought as the Divine Deduction technique gave him a broader perspective. ’The higher energy would be a building in comparison. How much power would it generate?’

Noah itched to test that procedure himself, but he knew that his situation wasn’t ideal. He didn’t have a way to accumulate "Breath", let alone using it to build more complex and powerful energy.

Yet, it was a path that reflected his individuality perfectly, and that would allow him to express his creation in ways that he had never thought before.

Meanwhile, the other assets started to take down the encampment to move it on the surface. There was no need to hide anymore. It was time to expand in the new world that still hid a series of threats.

The rank 4 cultivators could take care of the expansion though, and there was no need for that high number of stronger existences to remain there. Also, the Council and the Hive had left their borders exposed to make up for the presence of the powerhouses. Their assets wanted to return to their world.

Noah felt the need to return to the new continent too since he needed an environment where he could obtain all the resources that he needed. The only advantage of the new world was the presence of stronger creatures, but he didn’t lack nutrients at the moment.

Just like that, the majority of the powerful cultivators took turns to enter the fissure to return to their world. The invasion was officially over.
