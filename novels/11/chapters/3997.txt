Chapter 3998 Rallying Call

"You are no emperor."

"You are a second-class rat."

"You have come to the wrong state."

A large number of heavily-armored dwarven troops had barged into a ceremonial throne room.

The palace that incorporated the throne room was a new addition to Copperblock IX, a planet that was located within the territory of a prosperous first-rate state.

What caused the planet to stand out among other highly developed settlements was that it was larger and more massive than ordinary globes.

It was a heavy gravity planet where ordinary people would get crushed by their own weight if they wandered around without protection!

Even though every first-class citizen had the means to obtain this protection, most humans preferred to stay away from these troublesome planets.

This meant that the vast majority of people living in this particular space consisted of heavy gravity variant humans, otherwise known as dwarves.

For centuries, the dwarves that had settled in this prosperous star system had avoided the fate of many of their lessers and built up many massive companies and alliances.

From mining companies to mech companies, the industrious dwarves of the Copperblock System expanded their business across the state known as the United Kingdoms of Parnea.

The internal situation of Parnea was messy to say the least. Formed out of a partial fusion of different kingdoms, it was arguably the weakest first-rate state in human space.

Nonetheless, the power and wealth available to even the poorest first-raters far surpassed that of the second-raters!

It was due to the relative weaknesses and the many internal fault lines of the United Kingdoms of Parnea that a foreign dwarven ruler came from afar in order to build up more support for his cause.

The dwarven powers that had long divided Copperblock IX among themselves did not take kindly to the arrival of this dwarven loser.

Initially, they dismissed the presence of the Vulcanites. A bit of research revealed that they were nothing more than fleeing survivors of a fallen dwarven state.

Only sympathy towards their fellow dwarves caused these powers to leave the Vulcanites alone.

In any case, the refugees who had fled from afar were not poor. They had likely raided much of their former state's treasury before they ran away to the galactic center.

If not for the timely establishment of the Milky Way Galactic Gate Network, there was no way this group of refugees would have been able to reach the galactic center so quickly!

Even so, the Vulcanite immigrants drained their wealth remarkably quickly. The cost of everything was at least a thousand times higher than back in their home state. Some goods and services even cost a million times more than normal!

After paying for everything, the Vulcanites under the leadership of 'Emperor' Rion Aaden started to get dangerously low on funds.

This was extremely dangerous in first-rate states as the native population had little tolerance for broke people who only took up precious space without making any significant contributions!

While Rion was able to rely on foreign support to pay the bills, this did not change the fact that his organization continued to bleed a lot of money. This was especially the case when he still dared to pursue ambitious expansion plans!

This was why the Iron Emperor began to expand his influence among the dwarven natives of Copperblock IX.

For months, this eccentric dwarf ran around courting different dwarven people and organizations left and right.

A lot of powerful dwarves scoffed at this pathetic attempt. The balance of power on the heavy gravity planet had long been set in stone! Many companies were already aligned to the different power blocs that controlled Copperblock IX for many centuries. How could a bunch of second-class beggars possibly succeed in winning the support of these local elements, especially when the Vulcanites were lacking in so much money, strength and resources?

Much to the surprise of the complacent dwarven rulers, the Iron Emperor actually managed to achieve results.

Over thirty percent of the organizations courted by the Vulcanites eventually chose to break up their long-standing alliances.

Instead, these dwarven magnates and other important figures decisively threw their support behind the so-called Iron Emperor and his band of survivors!

The Vulcanites turned from a joke into a rising faction practically overnight!

When hundreds of successful companies and organizations united behind the Iron Emperor, the rulers of Copperblock IX finally realized that they could no longer afford to do nothing!

Already, the abrupt departure of so many long-term partners and allies had seriously affected the health of their own power blocs. Restoring the status quo became an acute priority!

This led to the current dramatic sight!

Several different mech forces under the control of the established local powers had descended onto the headquarters of the Vulcanites.

The powerful first-class multipurpose mechs overloaded the energy shields, demolished the defensive turrets, and overwhelmed the defending mechs by relying on their overwhelming superiority in numbers.

Not even Saint Yila Mayorka, who recently obtained a first-class ace mech courtesy of an allied dwarven mech company, was able to repel the invasion!

The Olympus Mons Mark II did not dare to move as it hovered over the main palace.

Eight opposing dwarven ace mechs surrounded the Mountain Hammer's new ace mech from every direction!

None of the powerful machines made any aggressive moves. Fights between ace mechs could easily escalate to the point of destroying entire cities!

Even if Saint Yila was outnumbered eight-to-one, if she truly wanted to, she could easily destroy a huge amount of infrastructure and kill thousands of dwarven citizens.

In fact, the local powers also hoped to win over the ace pilot.Visitt novùíÜlbin(.)cùíê/m for the lùíÇtest updates

The value of a halfgod was extremely precious, even for first-class powers!

While the chances of winning over opposing ace pilots was low, there was still a realistic chance of converting them as long as their 'owners' voluntarily relinquished their control over their champions.

This was why the elite assault troops that invaded the throne room did not immediately shoot their powerful plasma rifles and other formidable weapons at the massive, armored figure occupying the highest seat!

Instead, they made sure to disarm and secure the Iron Emperor's guards before waiting for further instructions from above.

Several projections soon came to life. Each of them displayed the leaders of the various major powers of Copperblock IX.

The center figure threw a disgusted expression at the leader of the guests from afar.

"Mr. Aaden."

[THE CORRECT PHRASE TO ADDRESS A MONARCH WHOSE RANK IS HIGHER THAN A PRINCE IS 'YOUR MAJESTY'.]

Chairman Merleus Davon snorted. "Mister. Aaden. In the last four months, Copperblock IX has generously given shelter to you and your ragged group of refugees. Based on our shared kinship, we have made several exceptions to our rules and allowed you to settle down on our planet and purchase land and property from our companies."

[WE DID NOT RECEIVE ANY CHARITY FROM YOUR ORGANIZATIONS. WE PAID EVERY FEE AND PURCHASED EVERY GOOD AND SERVICE AT FULL OR EVEN INFLATED PRICES.]

"We would have stopped you from entering our star system in the first place. Settling in a first-rate state is much more difficult than you can imagine. We gave you a chance to live on Copperblock IX, but instead you chose to bite the hand that fed you by taking over our business partners."

[YOUR 'BUSINESS PARTNERS' ARE NOT YOUR VASSALS. THEY ARE FREE TO DECIDE WHO THEY WANT TO COOPERATE WITH. NEITHER OF US HAVE BROKEN ANY LAWS. THE COMPANIES HAVE ALL PAID THE PENALTY FEES FOR PREMATURELY ENDING THEIR CONTRACTS WHENEVER APPLICABLE. THE REASON WHY THEY WERE GLAD TO JUMP SHIP WAS BECAUSE OF YOUR LONG-STANDING EXPLOITATION OF THOSE YOU REGARD AS YOUR LACKEYS.]

The chairman of the largest consortium on Copperblock IX grew angry! If not for his impeccable training and his sophisticated implants, he would have exploded at the pretentious foreign dwarf by now! As it was, he felt there was little point in continuing this discussion.

"Mr. Aaden, we have not come in order to hear your excuses. We have come in order to expel you and your disruptive group of Vulcanites from this planet and star system. You are to cease your business operations and other active ventures in our star system within a week. We have given instructions to all of the relevant institutions to expedite the withdrawal of your organization. We are even willing to forgo all of the punishment clauses and pay full price for all of the assets that you must liquidate on short notice."

[IT APPEARS YOU ARE EAGER TO SEE US DEPART.]

"Copperblock welcomes you no longer. The sooner you and your followers return to your ships and go, the sooner our star system can return to calm. We only ask for one single concession to guarantee your smooth departure."

[AND THAT IS?]

"The allegiance of Saint Yila Mayorka. A declining private individual such as yourself is unworthy to command a heroic dwarven ace pilot. Free her from her oath of loyalty so that we may offer her a brighter future as a proud citizen of the United Kingdoms of Parnea."

[IMPOSSIBLE.] The Iron Emperor boomed as his giant armored figure rose from the massive throne. One of its bulky arms held an ancient banner while the other gripped an oversized hand cannon. [SAINT MAYORKA DOES NOT SERVE AN INDIVIDUAL. HER LOYALTY LIES WITH THE DWARVEN PEOPLE AS A WHOLE. SHE WILL NEVER ANY OBEY ANY INSTRUCTIONS THAT ARE DETRIMENTAL TO OUR SPECIES. UNFORTUNATELY FOR YOU, YOUR ACTIONS INHIBIT THE RISE OF DWARVENKIND.]

"What are you talking about?! We are all dwarves, here!"

The thick helmet of the Iron Emperor retracted to reveal a hard and grizzled dwarven head.

[DID YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF DWARVES IN HUMAN SPACE? THERE ARE DWARVES WHO BETRAY THEIR OWN BY COLLABORATING WITH HUMANS, AND THERE ARE DWARVES WHO EARNESTLY FIGHT FOR THEIR DIGNITY AND SURVIVAL. I KNOW WHICH GROUP I BELONG TO. WHAT OF YOU, CHAIRMAN?]

As Rion Aaden boldly spoke, the gems set onto his crown began to glow and shine with power!

At this point, the Iron Emperor appeared much more valiant and authoritative than the various kings that nominally rule over the United Kingdoms of Parnea!

Chairman Merleus Davon and many of his fellow dwarves couldn't help but stare at the crown that was resting on top of the supposed monarch's head.

Even though the powerful dwarven leaders had seen more opulent and luxurious crowns throughout their lives, the angular and blocky object somehow evoked many associations within their hearts and minds!

It was a pity that the effect was a bit muted due to distance. Chairman Davon was unable to appreciate the full splendor of the Imperial Crown because he was actually situated in an underground bunker located on the opposite side of Copperhead IX!

"We will not engage in your twisted arguments any further, Mr. Aaden. We have already given you our ultimatum. Either release Saint Mayorka from your service, or we will crush you and each and every Vulcanite with the full might of our strike force. Your time has come to an end, dwarf."

[YOU ARE WRONG. MY TIME IS JUST BEGINNING.] Rion confidently smiled. [IT IS YOU THAT SHOULD BE WORRYING ABOUT RUNNING OUT OF TIME. THANK YOU FOR SENDING YOUR ACE PILOTS TO US. YOU HAVE GIVEN US A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY TO PERSUADE YOUR CHAMPIONS TO FIGHT FOR TRUE DWARVEN JUSTICE!]

Chairman Merleus Davon and his fellow dwarven rulers wanted to dismiss the upstart's words as outright delusions, but they started to get a bad feeling about this situation.

The Iron Emperor did not care about their doubts. The massive armored figure lifted the arm that held the ancient banner and seemed to peer straight through the roof of the throne room!

Both of Rion's relics released a bronze glow that made every nearby soldier feel connected to a presence that was greater and more magnificent than any other dwarf they had met in their lives!

[SAINT VORKAN ESPRAN!]

[SAINT GWENDOLYN DAVON!]

[SAINT MORVOGEN QUAS!]

[SAINT DIMITAR ACLUSIEU!]

[SAINT RABARBA DONALD!]

[SAINT TONY KOONZE!]

[SAINT REYA AMETRE!]

[SAINT GULIN POLLINTER!]

As the Iron Emperor called out each ace pilot in the service of different Copperhead power blocs, the foreign leader spoke as if he had transformed into a divine emissary!

[IN THE NAME OF VULCAN, RENOUNCE YOUR FORMER LOYALTIES! SUBMIT TO MY LEADERSHIP AND HELP ME LEAD DWARVENKIND TO A BETTER FUTURE!]

Much to the surprise of Chairman Davon and the other Copperheads, the dutiful champions that had put much effort into strengthening their loyalties all commanded their ace mechs to lower the arms pointed towards the Olympus Mons Mark II!

The eight ace mechs that previously fought on behalf of the Copperheads simultaneously turned outwards while their pilots simultaneously issued their response to the Iron Emperor's rallying call!

"WE FIGHT FOR DWARVENKIND!"
