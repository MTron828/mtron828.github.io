Chapter 3576 Quint Questioning Quentin

Living mechs were the distinct specialty of the Larkinson Clan.

While the Living Mech Corporation did release a number of third-class mech models on the mech market, they were all fairly old and did not impact the battles taking place in the more important parts of the galaxy.

The Hexadric Hegemony was the only third party to obtain the right to pilot second-class living mechs, and they had already discovered a lot of benefits and nuances about them. The Blessed Squires and Valkyrie Redeemers were such effective morale boosters that they had become the staple of the Hex Army.

The Hexers had even begun to develop variants themselves. Although the Hexer mech designers had to adopt a conservative approach in order to preserve the glows, the new and dizzying variety of Valkyrie mech models increasingly transformed warfare in the Komodo Star Sector beyond anyone's imagination!

With over a hundred million users of living mechs, the people's understanding of living mechs had increased by a remarkable degree.

The Larkinsons knew even more about living mechs. With the creator himself presiding over the clan, its members received plenty of insider knowledge on how to better draw out the potential of their special machines.

Jessica Quentin and her fellow mecher colleagues thought they knew what living mechs were capable of. So far, the machines did offer surprising capabilities, but they never really sold the idea that they were truly alive.

She had heard that the masterwork mechs of the Larkinson Clan were a lot better in this aspect, but without any opportunity to pilot them, she took these stories with a grain of salt. It was hard to believe in all of the hype given that the Larkinsons had a tendency to make wild and outlandish claims on a regular basis.

It wasn't until she finally piloted and connected with the Enlightened Warrior that she realized that her ideas about living mechs were flawed.

"You‚Ä¶ how‚Ä¶"

THAT IS NOT IMPORTANT. THIS IS ABOUT YOU, PILOT. YOUR DISSATISFACTION IN YOUR OWN STRENGTH AND YOUR DESIRE TO IMPROVE HAS ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION. IF YOU WISH TO BREAK PAST YOUR LIMITS, THEN YOU MUST HAVE THE WILL AND DETERMINATION TO IMPROVE NO MATTER THE COST.

"I already know that! I wouldn't be here if I wanted to be normal. I am committed to pursuing greater strength."

IS THAT ACTUALLY THE TRUTH?

"You doubt me?" She frowned.

YOUR WILL IS FEEBLER THAN YOUR THINK. PRIDE, EGO AND PRIVILEGE SUSTAINS YOUR DRIVE TO IMPROVE, BUT THOSE ARE BRITTLE PILLARS TO RELY UPON. PUT TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON THEM, AND THEY WILL BREAK, BRINGING YOU DOWN AS WELL.

Though Jessica wanted to refute this strange mech's words, deep in her heart she couldn't help but agree with the Quint.

Under normal circumstances, she would have replied with a face-saving retort, but she could already tell that wouldn't work.

Her mind was connected to the Enlightened Warrior through the neural interface. There was no way she could hide her true thoughts under these circumstances. She could feel the Enlightened Warrior and by extension the Quint judging her at this very moment.

She was afraid her performance had not been optimistic so far. Something about her failed to meet their requirements.

Her augmented mind worked quickly as she analyzed their previous conversations. She developed numerous theories on what the Quint found lacking in her. She quickly came up with an answer that had the highest chance of receiving a positive response.

"You believe that I am lacking a greater purpose, is that it?" She asked. "I am still young enough. I can still learn. I can find a cause that I am willing to fight for. Is that what you want?"

IT IS NOT AS SIMPLE AS SIMPLE AS THAT, JESSICA QUENTIN. OF THE TWO MECH PILOTS I HAVE GUIDED BEFORE, BOTH OF THEM HAVE INSHRINED THEIR DEDICATION TO THEIR FELLOW LARKINSONS IN THEIR HEARTS. THEY HAVE PROVEN THEIR WILL TO FIGHT TO THE DEATH IN NUMEROUS BATTLES. COMPARED TO THEM, YOU FALL FAR SHORT OF THAT IDEAL.

"I‚Ä¶ I may be behind them, but I can catch up to them! I am here to learn, Quint. Just give me the instructions." Jessica argued.

I AM ALREADY GIVING YOU INSTRUCTION. YOU LACK THE FUNDAMENTAL CONVICTION TO FIGHT AND DIE FOR ANYONE EXCEPT YOURSELF. YOUR PRINCIPLES ARE WEAK AND YOUR COMMITMENT TO MECH PILOTING IS BASED ON THE PROSPECT OF ENJOYING A GREATER STATUS IN HUMAN SOCIETY.

Jessica coughed. "That‚Ä¶ I do not think that I am as bad as you say! I have dedicated decades of my life to the piloting profession. I studied hard and won as many opportunities as I could to excel above my peers. I am training in piloting so many different mechs that there is hardly any machine that can stump me anymore. I threw myself into mastering the art of piloting lighter mechs so that I can push my greatest advantages as a mech pilot even further. I do not lack the drive to improve."

YET YOU HAVE NOT ADDRESSED YOUR GREATEST FLAW. YOU ARE A SMART MECH PILOT, JESSICA QUENTIN. YOU SHOULD HAVE ALREADY DERIVED THE REASON WHY YOU HAVE NEVER MADE ANY FURTHER PROGRESS AND WHY YOU WILL CONTINUE TO REMAIN STUCK.

The hardest attacks were ones that rang true. As a soldier, Jessica had gone through a lot of training. She did not remain fazed for too long when confronted by such a deep and vicious personal attack.

"I‚Ä¶ am not truly willing to die for the MTA." She admitted with a heavy breath.

It was an uncomfortable truth that she didn't want to say, but the Quint had forced her hand.

Despite all of her training, despite all of the good times she had with her fellow mechers and despite all of the benefits and privileges she received, the MTA's purpose did not rate higher than her personal ambitions.

The Mech Trade Association was too powerful. This bred a lot of arrogance among its members. Even if an individual within the Association wasn't good enough, there were always stronger and better mechers to bail them out. Countless first-class multipurpose mechs and many different warfleets stood ready to defeat any threat that could not be solved by a smaller number of mech pilots.

Jessica was such a small and inconsequential mech pilot within the organization that it was impossible for her to feel as if she could make a difference.

The MTA didn't need her strength. It had countless other mech pilots and highly talented personnel to call upon if it needed to fight against a powerful enemy.

Even if she did not do her best and failed to hold her ground in a battle, the stronger elements of the MTA would eventually come and solve the enemy in a more decisive fashion.

All of these thoughts and realizations made it so that Jessica Quentin lacked the conviction to die for the organization she worked for and grew up in. This was a problem that was not unique to mechers, but the fact that it applied to her as well meant that she was in a truly awful position!

Diagnosing the problem was easy, but solving it was another matter. Jessica could not find it within herself to develop a conviction for the MTA. She simply couldn't bring herself to this point given what she knew about the Association.

YOUR PROBLEM RUNS DEEP, BUT IT IS NOT INSURMOUNTABLE. THOUGH YOUR CHARACTER IS NOT AS GREAT AS THAT OF JOSHUA AND CASELLA, I CAN HELP YOU BRING YOU TO THAT LEVEL. THIS REQUIRES GREAT EFFORT ON MY PART. JUST MAINTAINING THIS DIRECT CONVERSATION WITH YOU IS ALREADY STRAINING MY CAPABILITIES.

"If you are trying to suggest that I should pledge my loyalty to the Larkinson Clan, then forget about, Quint. I may not be as stiff as I want, but I will not betray my oaths."

I WOULD DESPISE YOU IF YOU BENT SO EASILY TO THE DEMANDS OF OTHERS. I AM NOT ASKING FOR YOUR LOYALTY. I AM ASKING FOR YOUR SUBMISSION. WHAT I AM ASKING FROM YOU IS A PROMISE. Exppl√¥re ùíñptodùíÇte stories at no/ùíóel//bin(.)cùíêm

"A promise?"

I REQUIRE A SIMPLE PROMISE FROM YOU. WHILE I DO NOT ASK YOU TO PLEDGE YOUR LOYALTY TO THE LARKINSON CLAN, I DO NOT WISH TO RAISE A FUTURE ENEMY OF OURS. IF YOU WISH TO RECEIVE MY GUIDANCE, THEN YOU MUST PLEDGE A SOLEMN OATH TO NEVER ATTACK OR HARM THE LARKINSON CLAN AND ITS MEMBERS. IF YOU ARE EVER IN A POSITION WHERE YOU ARE COMPELLED TO ATTACK THE LARKINSONS, THEN YOU MUST AT THE VERY LEAST STAND ASIDE.

Jessica Quentin widened her eyes. Although this request sounded simple at first, it was actually filled with numerous traps!

For example, what should she do if the Larkinson Clan one day crossed the line? What if the Larkinsons detonated antimatter warheads on a populated human planet or actually colluded with aliens in order to set humanity back? Wouldn't it be more righteous for her to do her part in stopping the Larkinsons before they could commit more atrocities?

WHY ARE YOU HESITATING? THE PROMISE THAT YOU MUST MAKE ONLY APPLIES TO YOU. ACCORDING TO YOUR OWN THOUGHTS, THE MECH TRADE ASSOCIATION IS SUCH AN IMMENSE ORGANIZATION THAT YOUR REFUSAL TO OBEY INSTRUCTIONS WILL NOT AFFECT THE GREATER TREND. THERE ARE MANY MORE MECH PILOTS WHO ARE MORE THAN WILLING TO COMPLETE THE MISSION THAT YOU ARE OATHBOUND TO REFUSE.

"That‚Ä¶ is true." Jessica frowned. "It is the principle of the matter, though. I truly cannot bring myself to make any carve outs if I want to develop a serious conviction."

IF THAT IS WHAT YOU THINK, THEN YOU ARE MORE THAN WELCOME TO FIND YOUR OWN WAY TO BECOME AN EXPERT PILOT. THE ENLIGHTENED WARRIOR WILL NOT BE AS EFFECTIVE ON YOU IF YOU THINK THIS WAY. YOU ARE BETTER OFF PILOTING ANOTHER MECH.

"..."

Jessica had a lot to think about. Though there were many times where she wanted to refute or deny the Quint's words, the mech knew what it was talking about. She couldn't get rid of the notion that she might be missing the opportunity of her lifetime if she continued to remain inflexible about the masterwork mech's demands.

Was it worth it to pledge another oath and to put her personal ambitions above the greater interests of the MTA?

"I‚Ä¶ I've already been doing that for most of my life." She admitted to herself. "Maybe going a step further is not that much worse."

Her loyalty to the MTA compelled her to reject this option, but the more practical side of her knew that it wouldn't matter in the greater scheme of things.

She might receive a reprimand and make her superior upset, but everything was worth it as long as she was truly able to set off on the path to godhood.

The trajectories of every god pilot had proven that once a mech pilot obtained enough power, the MTA would begin to bend to their whims instead of the other way around!

Jessica set her sights squarely on the top. Nothing less than becoming a god pilot herself would make her feel fulfilled! Her desire to fulfill this dream made her a lot more willing to pledge a single additional oath!

"Fine. You win. I can't believe I'm actually agreeing to do this just because a mech told me to. This is most certainly one of the weirdest days of my life."

She felt dirty for compromising her loyalty to the MTA. She felt further removed from becoming an expert pilot because of that. She hoped that the Quint would be able to compensate for that and help her get even closer.

After Jessica pledged her oath with utmost sincerity, the Enlightened Warrior seemed to open up to her. The living mech behaved as if it was waiting for her to do something for the Larkinson Clan before it was willing to perform its function!

OPEN YOUR EYES, JESSICA, AND DISCOVER YOUR TRUE CONVICTION.

The Quint had activated a setting that introduced a new glow to the Enlightened Warrior. The mech seemed to bloom in a way that called up something deep inside Jessica's heart!
