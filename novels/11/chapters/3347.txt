Chapter 3348: Loud Speaker

Ves already suspected it for a while, but now he was truly certain.

He was not going to die today.

Rion did not harbor any great resentment towards the person who killed his previous self and the person responsible for causing his entire empire to collapse!

The Iron Emperor was a truly fitting title for this cybernetic and heavily augmented dwarf. By losing most of his memories of his past along with all of his emotional attachments, he lacked the empathy of most people.

As far as he was concerned, he started off his second life as someone who was already an adult. His abnormal development trajectory molded him into the leader that the dwarven people truly needed, but that was not necessarily good news for the citizens of the Vulcan Empire.

The Vulcanites who hated the tall folk and unflinchingly believed in the most ridiculous notions about their god were undesirable subjects that needed to be wiped out from existence to avoid spreading their poisonous ideology any further!

From that perspective, Ves did not make Rion angry for inflicting so much death and suffering onto his fellow dwarves.

Instead, it was more accurate to state that Ves did Rion a favor by getting rid of the trash!

Combined with the fact that the Iron Emperor apparently wanted to continue to make use of belief in Vulcan to further his control over his subjects, it was clear that killing Ves was counterproductive to his goals!

Besides, Rion had matured so much that it sounded as if he had long made peace with the fact that Ves caused his first death.

This was why Ves relaxed enough to join Rion in setting on the bottom of the steps. Though their respective suits of armor made it clear that their status were very different, for now he genuinely had the illusion that they were merely two old pals who reunited after a long time of separation.

It helped that this was actually the truth in a way.

Rion even played it up by ordering a bot to deliver an iron mug of Ambrosia for each of them. Soon, they began to loosen up a bit by enjoying their drinks.

"Hmmm‚Ä¶ this isn't the original recipe. It tastes much better." Ves smacked his lips as he looked impressed at the emperor's swill.

"YOUR RUSHED ATTEMPT AT BREWING AN ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE BACK THEN WAS WHOLLY INADEQUATE. IT IS A WONDER WE DID NOT ALL DIE OF METHANOL POISONING."

Ves winced a bit.

"Did anyone ever tell you that your electronically-distorted voice gets rather tiring to hear over time? You should tone it down a bit. There must be a setting available to you that can make you speak closer to a normal person."

Rion scoffed at this suggestion. "I AM AN EMPEROR. I STAND ABOVE OTHER DWARVES. I MUST COMPORT MYSELF AS A SOVEREIGN AT ALL TIMES IF I WISH TO COMMAND THE RESPECT AND LOYALTY OF MY PEOPLE. I HAVE STUDIED THE BIOGRAPHIES OF MANY FAMOUS LEADERS AND DYNASTIES. ONE OF THE MOST PERSISTENT REASONS WHY EMPIRES DECAY AND FALL IS BECAUSE THEIR SOVEREIGNS NO LONGER TOOK THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES SERIOUSLY. IF I WISH TO CONTINUE TO LEAD DWARVENKIND FOR MY ENTIRE LIFETIME, I MUST NEVER SLACKEN AND SHOW WEAKNESS."

Ves paused in his drinking. "That‚Ä¶ sounds way too harsh. I get why you're so driven, but you're not an expert pilot. You're a living person."

"YOU ARE INCORRECT. I TOLD YOU EARLIER THAT I AM HALF A MACHINE. ALTHOUGH I DID NOT MEAN THIS LITERALLY, MY MECHANIZATION HAS MADE IT EASIER FOR ME TO DETACH MY EMOTIONS AND MY BASER NEEDS. FROM THE MOMENT I CHOSE MY CALLING, I HAVE NO MORE NEED FOR LOVE, HATRED, FEAR, REGRET AND AND SO ON. THEY ARE ONLY SOURCES OF WEAKNESSES TO ME. ONLY CLEAR THINKING IS REQUIRED TO LEAD DWARVENKIND TO GREATNESS."

It sounded logical, but Ves could not accept it. He himself was an emotional person by nature and he had always relied on his own affection to lead his clan. It was unthinkable for Ves to throw away his heart and rely solely on cold hard logic to rule over the Larkinsons!

Perhaps this was why Ves could not get behind the Iron Emperor's approach. Rion sounded like a monster to him, and one of his own making!

The fact that the pretentious dwarven bastard spoke with such a loud, distorted voice and walked around in such a thick and massive suit of armor didn't help!

It was useless to continue this discussion. Rion had prepared a long time for the grand endeavor that he wished to undertake. There was no way he was open to suggestions from others, especially someone who did not really know what he was talking about!

Once Ves and Rion finished their mugs of Ambrosia, the latter began to address the true reason why he sought out Vulcan.

"WHEN I REGAINED MORE OF MY MEMORIES OF MY PAST SELF‚Ä¶ I KNEW YOU WOULD RETURN. TIMPALA STEEL IS AN EXCEPTIONALLY VALUABLE EXOTIC THAT IS SCARCE EVEN IN OTHER PARTS OF THE GALAXY. THE ONLY REASON FOR YOU TO BURY IT IN THIS ASTEROID BELT AT THE TIME WAS TO RETURN SOME DAY TO RETRIEVE THIS PRIZE."

"So you set a trap for me." Ves flatly said.

"I CAST A NET FOR VULCAN, AND I MANAGED TO CATCH A MECH DESIGNER." Diiscover new ùíîtories at nùíêve/lbin(.)c/oùíé

"Why? I mean, you just told me earlier that you want to make use of religion as a tool to control the masses, but can't you do that without my help?"

'I COULD, BUT I NEED MORE THAN THAT. IF I TRULY WISH TO GAIN THE ENDURING LOYALTY AND OBEDIENCE OF DWARVENKIND, I MUST STAND OUT FROM THEM IN A WAY THAT UNQUESTIONABLY PUTS ME ON TOP. THAT IS DIFFICULT TO ACCOMPLISH AS THERE ARE STILL MANY FIRST-CLASS DWARVES IN HUMAN SOCIETY WHO HAVE MANAGED TO PROMOTE TO HIGH STATIONS. IT IS NECESSARY BUT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR A SECOND-RATER LIKE MYSELF TO DEMAND THEIR SUBMISSION."

Ves understood now why Rion banked on religion despite his obvious lack of faith. His power was too insufficient at his current stage. Though the revived dwarf talked a big game and painted himself as the emperor of all dwarves, such a claim was hard to enforce when there were many other powerful dwarves who possessed much more wealth and power than a loud-speaking hillbilly from the galactic rim!

The self-proclaimed iron emperor did not have the foundation to overpower or outspend the dwarven first-raters! Yet he needed to do so in order to truly gain access to the power, tech, resources and manpower needed to found a rival star empire that could truly compete against human civilization on an equal level!

So what kind of measure worked best at swaying the most elite and privileged dwarves in existence? By hoodwinking them with religion!

Belief in Vulcan was unique in that it was highly compelling to every dwarf. It was a faith that was uniquely tailored to the dwarven race and affected both rich and poor, male and female, third-rater and first-rater and many other groups!

Rion smiled knowingly at Ves. "THE POWER OF RELIGION TRANSCENDS THE CLASSES. WITH YOUR PECULIAR TRAITS, YOUR DIVINE PERSONA SHALL BE THE MEANS I PLAN TO USE TO UNITE ALL OF DWARVENKIND. THE VULCAN EMPIRE HAS ALREADY PROVEN THE VIABILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS APPROACH. I SHALL MERELY BE REPEATING THIS EXPERIMENT AGAIN BUT WITHOUT ALL OF THE EXCESSES IN THE FIRST ATTEMPT."

This was still a difficult plan to pull off. First-raters were far more difficult to persuade than second-raters. Each of them were incredibly arrogant towards their lessers and Ves doubted that they would fall for this scheme so easily!

There was also a huge flaw to this plan.

"What makes you think the dwarves who embrace your dream will let you take charge of them all?" Ves questioned. "Just because you can persuade the first-class dwarves to believe in Vulcan doesn't mean they think that you should call the shots. They can just retain their belief and Vulcan and force you off your throne!"

The Iron Emperor did not look fazed. Instead, he smirked.

"DID YOU THINK I OVERLOOKED THIS POSSIBILITY? WHAT YOU HAVE JUST SAID IS THE REASON WHY I HAVE SQUATTED IN THIS ASTEROID FOR SO MANY YEARS. I WAITED AND WAITED FOR YOUR ARRIVAL THAT I WAS EVEN PREPARED TO SIT STILL FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER CENTURY FOR YOU OR YOUR AGENT TO TAKE THE BAIT."

That sounded pretty extreme to Ves!

"What‚Ä¶ do you want from me that is worth all of that waiting?"

The most important point of this reunion had come. Rion had already explained what had happened to him, what he had done since his revival and what he planned to do for the future.

Now, the conversation finally turned to a topic that was directly related to Ves and his own future!

Rion's bulky armor shifted as he slowly raised himself up to his feet again. Ves also stood up as the mood in the ceremonial chamber grew heavier.

"AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE, I INTEND TO USE RELIGION TO GATHER MORE DWARVES TO ME, BUT I MUST ALSO FIND A WAY TO GUARANTEE MY LEADERSHIP POSITION IN THE MOST DECISIVE MANNER POSSIBLE. THE ONLY WAY FOR ME TO ACCOMPLISH BOTH IS TO TIE THEM TOGETHER. YOU MUST ANOINT ME WITH THE POWER TO RULE OVER THE DWARVES."

"What?! How the hell am I supposed to do that?!"

"IT IS QUITE SIMPLE, VULCAN. YOU ARE A MECH DESIGNER WHO IS FAMED FOR CREATING ARTIFACTS." Rion expressly directed his cybernetic eyes towards the Hammer of Brilliance that was attached to Ves' external toolbelt. "ONE SUCH AS THIS, FOR EXAMPLE."

Ves possessively clutched the handle of his hammer. "This is not for sale. This is a craftsman tool that I use to make fancy stuff. A high and noble sovereign such as you doesn't need such a crude instrument."

"YOUR HAMMER IS ANYTHING BUT CRUDE. SEEING IT MAKES ME EVEN MORE CONFIDENT THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO DELIVER WHAT I REQUIRE. WHAT I NEED IS NOT A HAMMER, BUT A SYMBOL OF AUTHORITY THAT IS TIED SOLELY TO MYSELF AND IMPARTS YOUR BLESSING AND APPROVAL OF MY REIGN OVER DWARVENKIND."

"You mean‚Ä¶"

Rion's cybernetic eyes glowed brighter. "A CROWN, IN OTHER WORDS. I NEED YOU TO CRAFT A CROWN OF YOUR OWN DESIGN THAT MEETS MY REQUIREMENTS."

"Uhm, I'm just a mech designer, Rion. Aren't you asking too much from me?" Ves nervously replied.

'I HAVE STUDIED YOUR WORK EXTENSIVELY, VULCAN. YOUR MECH DESIGNS AND YOUR ARTIFACTS ALL POSSESS QUALITIES THAT TRANSCEND REGULAR PRODUCTS, AS BEFITTING OF AN INDIVIDUAL WHO CLAIMS TO BE A GOD OF CRAFTSMANSHIP. I SHOULD KNOW, BECAUSE I HAVE STUDIED ONE OF YOUR WORKS IN DEPTH."

The Iron Emperor gazed lovingly at the Banner of Vulcan that he constantly held by his side like an old and constant companion.

It was hard to refute Rion when he knew Ves so damn well!

"THE BANNER OF VULCAN ALREADY FUNCTIONS AS MY SCEPTER. ONCE YOU MAKE A CROWN FOR ME, I WILL COMPLETE MY COLLECTION AND WILL TRULY LEAVE NO DOUBT THAT I AM THE ANOINTED EMPEROR OF DWARVENKIND!"

"Okay‚Ä¶ so let me get this straight. You went through all of this trouble and waited so many years in this empty star system just so you can seek me out and commission a crown from me?!" Ves asked in an exasperated tone.

BOOM.

BOOM.

BOOM.

Rion stepped closer until he stopped right in front of Ves again. "IF THAT IS THE WAY YOU INTERPRET MY ACTIONS, THEN YES, I AM COMMISSIONING A CROWN FOR YOU. I EXPECT YOU TO DO YOUR BEST AND CRAFT A MASTERWORK, BECAUSE ONLY A TRANSCENDENT ARTIFACT IS REMARKABLE ENOUGH TO CONVINCE THE DWARVEN FIRST-RATERS TO FOLLOW THEIR TRUE EMPEROR."

The Iron Emperor threw an encouraging smile at Ves.

"YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE CAN GO FREE AFTER YOU HAVE COMPLETED MY COMMISSION TO MY SATISFACTION. I HAVE NO INTEREST IN ENDURING THE COMPANY OF YOU HUMANS ANY LONGER THAN NECESSARY. I GIVE YOU MY PROMISE AS EMPEROR THAT YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE ARE FREE TO LEAVE THE VULCAN EMPIRE AND RUN OFF TO THE RED OCEAN. WHAT YOU DO THERE IS NOT A CONCERN FOR DWARVENKIND."

Up until now, Ves didn't think that Rion was so bad. He might be a heartless dwarf with delusions of grandeur, but his logic and rationality meant that he was very realistic.

This time was an exception, though!

"Do you know how impossible it is to fulfill your demand!? I may have made a few masterworks here and there, but it is too much to ask for a masterwork on demand!"

The dwarven leader's expression grew darker. "YOU SHALL OBEY MY WILL, VULCAN. I HAVE LEARNED THAT YOU WORK BEST UNDER PRESSURE, SO LET ME GIVE YOU AN INCENTIVE TO MAXIMIZE YOUR EFFORT. YOU HAVE ONE DAY TO FULFILL MY DEMANDS. IF YOU FAIL TO MEET MY EXPECTATIONS, I SHALL COMMAND SAINT MAYORKA TO FINISH THE JOB AND ANNIHILATE EVERY SHIP AND MECH OF YOUR PRECIOUS GOLDEN SKULL ALLIANCE. YOUR CLAN SHALL COME TO RUIN AND YOUR LARKINSONS SHALL BE BURIED AMONG THE SURROUNDING ASTEROIDS. WORK HARD, VULCAN, AND LIVE UP TO YOUR IDENTITY AS THE GOD OF DWARVES, MECHS AND CRAFTSMANSHIP. IF NOT‚Ä¶"

A huge gun barrel that was as wide as a human head extended out of Rion's underarm and pressed right onto Ves' head.

"I MIGHT DECIDE TO RECIPROCATE THE FAVOR THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN ME ALL OF THOSE YEARS AGO."

Ves gulped.
