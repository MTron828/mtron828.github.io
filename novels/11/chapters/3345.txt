Chapter 3346: Imperial Ambitions

This was a strange reunion.

Everytime his consciousness traveled back to the past with the help of the System, he did what he was supposed to do in order to experience what it was like to pilot a mech before returning to the present.

Of course, battles where mech pilots needed to risk their lives rarely revolved around trivial matters. Many of the mech pilots that the System randomly picked out to host his consciousness became involved in greater events.

Whether it was breaking out of a pocket space or sparking a slave revolt, a mech pilot only fought best when they committed their entire lives for a cause that was greater than themselves.

This was how expert pilots were born, and it did not miss his notice that a noticeably high proportion of Mastery hosts broke through or became exceptional in another way.

Assuming the System had the power to choose the destination of a Mastery experience, it was more effective to select a mech pilot with the potential for greatness. It was only when they threw everything they had for a cause they believed in that their piloting approach maximized all of their potential, allowing Ves to observe first-hand how a given mech type should ideally be piloted.

That was all Ves cared about, really. He never forgot that learning a Mastery was supposed to benefit him. He never put much thought about what his hosts gained out of these brief time jaunts. After all, the events happened so far away from his present location and so far back in time that it was impossible for his 'past' deeds to come back and affect his present circumstances.

At least, that was what he had always assumed.

It appeared he had to correct this presumptuous conclusion. Now that he came face to face with a familiar Mastery host of the past, Ves regretted that he had acted with so little regard for the ripple effects he created in the timeline!

It was worse when Ves actively traveled to a region where his 'past' self once intervened. This vastly increased the probability of sparking a highly undesirable confrontation and reuniting with an 'old friend'.

In other words, Ves brought this upon himself.

The Iron Emperor was the fourth individual who could make Ves feel as if he was nearly completely exposed.

Calabast and Sigrund were the first ones to pierce through his veil of secrecy. Both of them subsequently blackmailed him with the information they gained.

After that came Master Willix whose authority and vision were far too great for Ves to resist against. It was fortunate that she only grasped one of his lesser secrets and not his greatest one that would instantly bring the entire MTA down on his head!

Now, a disgustingly clever, wise and observant version of Rion Aaden joined this club!

The current Rion was more comparable to the likes of Minister Shederin and Senator Tovar than the stupid, gullible dwarf of the past.

Even a pig would turn into a scarily smart and competent statesman after receiving the equivalent of trillions of hex credits worth of cybernetic implants, genetic modification and tutoring from some of the best teachers in the galaxy!

What also turned Rion into a formidable individual was how much time had passed since he started his new lease on life. So much time had passed since the beginning of the rebellion that he had gone through many life experiences and matured each step of the way.

All of this resulted into a dwarf that truly deserved to be regarded as the emperor of the Vulcanites. Ves even admired Rion Aaden a bit for working so hard all of this time. The determination he showed was much more impressive than any other dwarf or human for that matter. Step by step he studied and improved his skills until he was truly able to lead the Vulcan Empire to a greater future!

Why didn't it happen, then? Why didn't Rion step out of the shadows? With the current crisis engulfing the Vulcan Empire, his people needed his leadership more than ever!

"ARE YOU WONDERING WHY I HAVE DECIDED TO REMAIN IN THE SHADOWS AFTER SO LONG?"

Ves tentatively nodded. He did not feel as uncomfortable in Rion's presence than before, but he was always mindful that his life and future was still in the dwarven emperor's hands.

Just his powered dwarven armor was strong enough to flatten Ves like a bug, especially when the local gravity was as high as 4.6 g!

Fortunately, Rion did not look like he was eager to repay the round that Ves had fired through his head.

Instead, the dwarf continued to set upon the steps of his throne while carefully caressing the banner draped over his thick, armored legs.

"I HAVE ALREADY REVEALED ONE OF MY REASONS FOR STAYING OUT OF THE FOREFRONT OF THE VULCAN EMPIRE. THE VULCAN EMPIRE HAS ALREADY CHOSEN ITS LEADERS."

"Not good ones considering what has happened on their watch." Ves pointed out.

The cybernetic dwarf shook his head. "MY GRAND-NEPHEW IS DOING THE BEST HE CAN DO WITH THE RESOURCES HE HAS AVAILABLE. EVEN I CANNOT SUPPRESS THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE VULCAN FAITH AND THE DWARVEN GOD CULT. I SHOULD KNOW. I HAVE ALREADY TRIED."

"You… sound like you're not entirely happy with the state of the Vulcan Empire."

"LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED." The armored dwarf waved his giant armored hand. "THE FOUNDATION OF THE VULCAN EMPIRE WAS FLAWED FROM THE BEGINNING. THE DOMINOES OF ITS OWN FALL HAD ALWAYS BEEN IN PLACE. THE EVENTS THAT TRANSPIRED AFTER YOUR ACTIONS ARE SOLELY THE FAULT OF THE VULCANITES THEMSELVES."

Ves took a second look at Rion. The dwarven emperor's analysis of the situation matched disturbingly well with Shederin Purnesse's own views on the stability of the Vulcan Empire!

"You call yourself the Iron Emperor, but how can you rule when there aren't any people under you anymore? The state founded in your name is collapsing at the seams!"

Bang!

Rion's armored fist clanged against the step!

"THE VULCAN EMPIRE IS A STATE FOUNDED IN YOUR NAME, NOT MINE. THE QUALITY OF ITS CULTURE AND INSTITUTIONS REFLECT THE QUALITY OF THE SOURCE THAT INSPIRED THEIR CREATION. IF MY CURRENT SELF WAS IN CHARGE AT THE TIME, I WOULD HAVE NEVER ALLOWED THE VULCAN EMPIRE TO LAY THE SEEDS OF ITS OWN DESTRUCTION AT THE ONSET."

That sounded strange. Ves had never heard a head of state disparaging his own empire!

"You… don't believe in your own state?"

"DO YOU BELIEVE IN THE STABILITY AND SURVIVAL OF THE VULCAN EMPIRE?" Rion asked as his cybernetic yellow eyes stared straight at Ves.

"No." Ves truthfully replied. "When I first heard about it, I always thought it sat in a precarious position. Now that I have visited it and experienced the charm of your subjects, I think even less of this state."

"SINCE YOU CAN THINK ABOUT THIS, WHY WOULD I BE DIFFERENT?"

"Uh…"

"DID YOU THINK I WAS IDENTICAL TO THE OTHER VULCANITES YOU HAVE MET WHO REFLEXIVELY FALL BACK ON THEIR RELIGIOUS FANATICISM AND THEIR ACQUIRED SENSE OF DWARVEN SUPREMACY?"

"Kinda…"

"FOOL." Rion flatly said. "UNLIKE NEARLY EVERY INHABITANT OF THE VULCAN EMPIRE, I HAVE KEPT MY DISTANCE FROM ITS SOCIETY. FOR DECADES, I CONSTANTLY TRACKED THE GROWTH AND EVOLUTION OF MY STATE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF AN OBSERVER. THIS HAS ALLOWED ME TO SHIELD MYSELF AGAINST THE LIES, DISTORTIONS AND PROPAGANDA THAT HAS WARPED THE DWARVES WHO LIVE THERE. I KNOW THE TRUTH, AND THE TRUTH HAS SET ME FREE."

"If you know how awful your Vulcanites truly are, then why didn't you put more effort into changing them? I mean, just look at how they sound. If they aren't arguing about whether their god is a human or a dwarf, they're constantly shouting slogans on how they wished to exterminate every tall folk in the galaxy."

"THAT IS WHY MY FELLOW DWARVES ARE IMBECILES."

The brutal statement shocked Ves. He never thought that Rion in his current, impressive state would admit that! What shocked him even more was the implications behind these words.

Ves began to develop a suspicion about why Rion never bothered to intervene after all of this time.

"You gave up on the Vulcan Empire, didn't you?" He asked. "You saw what your fellow dwarves have created in your absence and thought that it was too far gone for you to salvage."

Rion's grim face loosened up and smiled. "YOU GET IT NOW. I INDEED THINK LITTLE OF VULCAN EMPIRE. IT IS A ROTTEN STATE THAT SHOULD NEVER HAVE EXISTED. WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW WOULD HAVE HAPPENED SOONER OR LATER. AT LEAST NOW I NO LONGER HAVE TO WAIT IN SUSPENSE."

"You don't sound like you take your position as emperor seriously at all. Are you really content to hide out here and watch as trillions of dwarves lose their rights or get displaced?" Ves looked confused.

"THE OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF DWARVEN CITIZENS WERE DOOMED FROM THE START. THEY WERE ALREADY BEYOND SAVING. THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO TO AVOID THEIR CURRENT FATES."

Ves felt a shiver run through his back. The realism displayed by Rion was too brutal and cold-hearted. He was completely unlike the other Vulcanites who always stood up for their fellow dwarves. If Rion clearly hadn't identified himself as a dwarf already, people would have mistaken him as a human!

Rion's armor let out a lot of noise as he slowly stood up from the steps. His heavy, armored body stepped closer to Ves. "I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT RULING THE VULCAN EMPIRE OR SAVING ITS CITIZENS BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL BEYOND SAVING."

"So you're just going to do nothing at all and just hide out here until your body expires?"

The dwarven emperor fell silent for a moment before he spoke again.

"WHEN THE MTA BROUGHT MY BODY BACK TO LIFE, I WOKE UP AS A DIFFERENT PERSON. I DO NOT CONSIDER MYSELF TO BE THE RION THAT YOU AND MY FORMER REBEL COMRADES KNEW. I AM A DIFFERENT PERSON AND LIVED A DIFFERENT LIFE. HOWEVER, THE ONE TRAIT THAT I SHARE WITH THE RION THAT I USED TO BE IS THAT I AM A DWARF. FROM THE MOMENT I WOKE UP AGAIN, I HAVE ALWAYS SOUGHT THE MEANING BEHIND MY RETURN. WHY DID I COME BACK TO LIFE? WHAT IS MY PURPOSE IN LIFE. WITH THE RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES THAT I HAVE ENJOYED THROUGHOUT MY LIFE, I HAVE GRADUALLY REALIZED THAT I AM BURDENED BY A HEAVY RESPONSIBILITY, ONE THAT ONLY I CAN FULFILL."

"And what is that responsibility?"

"TO LEAD THE DWARVES TO A BETTER FUTURE THAN NOW!" Rion raised an armored fist! "MOST VULCANITES ARE BEYOND SAVING, BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT I HAVE FORSAKEN DWARVENKIND AS A WHOLE! IN FACT, IT IS THE OPPOSITE! ONLY BY REMOVING THE CANCER THAT IS THE VULCAN EMPIRE CAN OUR SPECIES TRULY MOVE FORWARD!"

"You… what is it what you are trying to accomplish?"

Rion carefully gripped the pole of his banner. "LOOK AT THE VULCAN EMPIRE. LOOK AT THE STATE OF THE DWARVEN DIASPORA. WHERE DO MY PEOPLE LIVE?"

"They live in different parts of human space."

"CORRECT, AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IS WRONG WITH DWARVENKIND!"

"Why? Aren't you guys humans as well?" Ves frowned a bit.

"I DO NOT BELIEVE SO." Rion spoke as he stepped closer to the person who murdered his past self. "TOO MANY PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT DWARVES AND HUMANS SHARE THE SAME IDENTITY AS DIFFERENT STRAINS OF HUMANKIND. YET DOES YOUR ATTITUDE AND BEHAVIOR REFLECT THIS STANCE? NO. IN PRACTICE, DWARVES ARE TREATED AS A SEPARATE SPECIES. NO HUMAN TREAT DWARVES AS EQUALS. INSTEAD, WE ARE BEING LOOKED DOWN UPON, BOTH LITERALLY AND FIGURATIVELY."

Ves could do little to excuse such behavior. He had seen it happening many times himself. The galaxy wasn't fair and humanity was still too flawed to let go of its biases and prejudices.

"I can't deny that has happened, but heavy gravity variant humans—"

"DON'T CALL US THAT!" Rion exploded into Ves' face! Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

For the first time since this meeting, Rion had finally lost his cool!

"WE ARE NOT 'HUMAN', BOTH FROM A CULTURAL AND BIOLOGICAL STANDPOINT! YOU HAVE ALREADY ADMITTED YOURSELF THAT DWARVES ARE TREATED MORE POORLY THAN OTHER HUMANS. OUR PHYSIOLOGY HAVE ALSO DIVERGED SO WIDELY FROM BASELINE HUMANS THAT THERE IS A STATE OF REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION BETWEEN OUR TWO SPECIES."

BOOM!

Rion had stamped the deck with his armored leg, causing Ves to momentarily shake from the nearby vibration!

"DWARVES ARE NOT HUMAN. NOT ANYMORE. WE ARE A SEPERATE SPECIES, BUT ALMOST NOBODY REALIZES THAT. AS THE EMPEROR OF DWARVENKIND, IT IS MY DUTY AND CALLING TO MAKE MY PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THE TRUTH. AS SOON AS MY FELLOW DWARVES RECOGNIZES THAT THEY WERE NEVER HUMAN AND WILL NEVER BE TREATED AS THEIR EQUALS, I CAN FINALLY LEAD THEM TO THEIR REAL DESTINY?"

"And that is…?"

Rion's enormous armored suit bent down until his dark and bald face rested close to Ves' helmet. "I SHALL LEAD THEM ONTO AN EXODUS FROM HUMAN SPACE AND FOUND A REAL EMPIRE FOR THE DWARVES."

The Iron Emperor finally revealed his true ambition!

"MY ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO FOUND A SOVEREIGN NATION, ONE THAT IS NOT UNDER THE SWAY OF THE MTA OR CFA. THESE HUMAN ORGANIZATIONS WILL NO LONGER BE ALLOWED TO DICTATE AND LIMIT THE DEVELOPMENT OF DWARVENKIND! ONLY BY CREATING OUR OWN STAR NATION IN A GALAXY THAT EXISTS OUTSIDE OF HUMAN SPACE WILL DWARVENKIND TRULY BE ABLE TO MATCH AND EXCEED HUMANITY'S GLORY!"

Rion arrogantly looked down at Ves. "SO NO, I WILL NOT TAKE CHARGE OF THE VULCAN EMPIRE. IT IS A HANDICAPPED STATE THAT SITS RIGHT INSIDE HUMANITY'S BACKYARD. I REFUSE TO BECOME THE MTA'S SLAVE!"

Ves couldn't count the amount of times he was shocked today. Of all of the ambitions that he had ever heard from a person, no one had ever been as bold as Emperor Rion, who openly wanted to defect from human civilization!
