Colorful Balloons Take Flight

A bombastic and distinctive musical score started to play.

At the same time, boldly colored graphics came into view of the broadcasted feed.

Both of these elements had been carefully designed to attract as much attention as possible while also being recognizable enough to trigger familiarity to every fixed viewer.

Once the intro had finished playing, the view of the broadcast changed to depict a typical modern talkshow decor.

The host of the program raised her arms and smiled at the live audience as she started her performance in front of an audience of trillions remote viewers for her fifth straight year!

Meanwhile, the title card finally scrolled into view.

[NAJAN KITTAR: DIGGING DEEPER]

[DIVING DEEPER INTO THE NEWS OF THE UNDERREPRESENTED PEOPLE OF THE GALAXY]

As the olive-skinned woman wearing a professional dark green business suit stood at the center of the stage, she began to speak with her impeccably trained diction.

"Good morning, good afternoon, good evening and goodnight to you galactic citizens! No matter whether you are waking up to our show on a Terran heritage planet in the Milky Way, or settling into bed after a long day of work at a colony in the Red Ocean, our program is ready to deliver you more than a collection of shallow soundbites and vapid news stories. Sit back or lie down and prepare to learn about the plight of the underprivileged, because our feature interview for the day is one that you do not want to miss in the live broadcast!"

After the award-winning journalist and interviewer continued to work her audience for another two minutes before she finally introduced her main guest.

"Have no fear, for the wait is finally over! Without any further ado, I would like to introduce you to one of the most remarkable and colorful individuals that has ever graced my studio in the 5 year run of my program."

A new musical track began to play. This one sounded much different from the introduction music, making it clear that it did not originate from the broadcast program itself.

Instead, the music had a more grander and more formal character. An entire traditional orchestra of instruments played a strong, masculine and martial anthem that couldn't help but boil people's blood!

Loud metal footsteps thumped from the left side of the stage. The guest was about to emerge and already the viewers understood that the new arrival was large and heavy!

"Our guest was born as a slave in a third-rate state."

CLANK.

"He has sparked a righteous rebellion against an unjust regime."

CLANK.

"He has managed to return from the dead after the MTA generously patched up his broken and ruined brain."

CLANK.

"He reigned as the emperor of a second-rate state founded by his fellow rebels for many decades."

CLANK.

"Though his empire collapsed as his people had self-destructed due to sectarian strife, he still perseveres."

CLANK.

"This former sovereign has never given up on uniting his people and putting an end to the mistreatment they endure to this day."

CLANK.

"Give it up for His Majesty Rion Aaden, the first and only emperor of the former Vulcan Empire!"

Many viewers became amazed at the sheer amount of presence exuded by the guest that arrived while wearing an oversized suit of armor.

There was nothing delicate and elegant about the gear. Its bare metallic plating was thick and angular. The sculpted iron-like mask depicted the face of a broad and imperious-looking humanoid.

The heavy and oversized crown that seamlessly slotted into the helmet especially attracted a lot of eyeballs.

It was the centerpiece of the heavy figure's martial appearance.

Despite the symbolic meaning of the crown, the heavy and iron-like ornament looked like it was tough enough to withstand the rigors of battle.

High, angular and blocky, the crown looked as if it encapsulated the culture of the dwarven people!

Embellished with sparkling, luminescent jewels as well as a pair of ram horns spiraling from sides, the crown's most distinctive visual feature was the hammer symbol that surrounded the feature of an unknown dwarven figure.

The eye symbol that surrounded the central jewel also looked compelling, though few individuals understood its true meaning.

Just like the rest of the audience, Najan Kittar couldn't help but pause and admire the exquisite craftsmanship of the head ornament.

"Your Majesty Rion Aaden, before we begin to go into depth about your cause, let me ask you this. Is that headdress a masterwork?!"T/his chapter is updatùìÆd by nùíêv(√™(l)biin.co/m

Viewers with a technical background had already figured out the nature of the crown beforehand, but much of the rest became a lot more impressed once they figured out why the item looked so much grander than many others of its kind.

[MY IMPERIAL CROWN IS INDEED A MASTERWORK. I COMMISSIONED IT MYSELF, AND THE CRAFTSMAN WHO WORKED ON IT STAKES HIS LIFE ON ITS COMPLETION. IT IS ONE OF THE FINEST OBJECTS IN MY POSSESSION, AND I WEAR IT WITH PRIDE. IT'S WEIGHT CONSTANTLY BEARS DOWN ON MY HEAD, REMINDING ME OF MY MANY RESPONSIBILITIES AND BURDENS.]

"That is interesting to hear." Najan sounded genuinely fascinated. "Whoever fashioned your crown can knock my jeweler out of the park. What is the name of the esteemed master smith you have turned to with your crown commission? A crown maker who is able to create an ornament this good should not remain in obscurity! Once I have had my fill, I would be more than happy to introduce him to a dozen kings, emperors and other hereditary sovereigns that could use an update to their ceremonial regalia."

A distorted grunt escaped from the armored dwarf's closed helmet.

[THE IDENTITY OF THE MAKER OF THIS CROWN IS NOT FOR ME TO REVEAL. HAVE NO FEAR. HE WILL BE KNOWN TO YOU SOONER OR LATER.]

"I understand. Not every master craftsman wants to be swamped with requests, many of which cannot easily be turned down." Najan Kittar smiled before she gestured at the seats. "Please sit down so we can delve into the topics that truly matter."

While Najan seated herself on a large and comfortable red chair, the dwarven emperor plopped his heavy form onto a thick metal bench that looked substantially out of place in the stage's decor.

"Now that we are comfortable, let me ask you a question that has puzzled my producers and I from the moment you came to our attention. Do you not feel ashamed for continuing to cling onto the imperial title of an empire that has not only become defunct, but whose very people tore each other apart for a reason as silly as arguing about whether their god is a human or a dwarf?"

The starting question always set the tone for the rest of the interview. Najan Kittar clearly signaled that she was not willing to go soft for this session!

It was a pity that the guest completely covered up his body. His stern and unmoving iron mask exposed no emotion.

[THE VULCAN EMPIRE HAS PERISHED. THAT IS TRUE. I DO NOT DENY MY CULPABILITY FOR ITS EVENTUAL COLLAPSE. HOWEVER, YOU OVERESTIMATE MY POWER. I DID NOT REIGN AS ITS THE HEAD OF GOVERNMENT, BUT RATHER AS ITS HEAD OF STATE. DESPITE ITS NAME, THE VULCAN EMPIRE WAS VERY MUCH A DEMOCRATIC STATE.]

Najan Kittar's eyes grew sharper. "That sounds like negligence, Your Majesty. As the parental figure of one of the heroes of our civilization's most cherished ancient myth had once said, with great power comes great responsibility. The power you once wielded allowed you to step in and stop the madness that has befallen your Vulcan Empire at any time prior to its collapse. Why did you not step in while you still could?"

[I LOVE DEMOCRACY. PERHAPS TOO MUCH.] The distorted voice said with a tinge of regret. [IN STATECRAFT, THERE IS ALWAYS A TENSION BETWEEN DOING WHAT IS RIGHT AND DOING WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT. HUMAN HISTORY IS RIFE WITH EXAMPLES LEADERS WHO HAVE LEANED TOWARDS THE FORMER HAVE ALWAYS ERRED AND PRODUCED THEIR OWN DOWNFALL AS A RESULT. I DID NOT DESIRE TO FOLLOW THEIR EXAMPLE.]

"Are you trying to escape guilt by claiming to have no control over a state where its overwhelmingly dwarven citizens revered you as both their spiritual and temporal leader?"

The armored dwarf's head slightly shook. [THE PEOPLE HAVE CHOSEN A LONG TIME AGO. THEY HAVE SET THE SEEDS OF THEIR STATE'S COLLAPSE BY THEMSELVES, AND THOUGH I HAVE TRIED TO INCREASE THE STABILITY OF MY EMPIRE WHILE RESPECTING THE WILL OF MY CITIZENS, IT WAS AN IMPOSSIBLE TASK. MY PEOPLE HAVE CHOSEN DEATH, AND NO AMOUNT OF PERSUASION COULD HAVE CONVINCED THEM TO CHANGE THEIR MINDS.]

It was clear that the self-proclaimed Iron Emperor was not going to apologize or admit principal responsibility for the tragedies that had befallen the Vulcan Empire, so Najan Kittar had little choice but to move on and let her viewers form their own judgment.

"Let us talk about what you have done since your departure from your doomed state. You have not let this terrible tragedy stop you from putting more dwarves under your wing. You took advantage of the Galactic Gate Network to move to the galactic center where you have subsequently managed to enter the United Kingdoms of Parnea, a first-rate state. Not only that, but you have managed to convince a group of powerful and successful first-class dwarves to pledge their allegiance to you, a failed and disgraced second-rater."

Rion Aaden let out a powerful scoff. [I HAVE ALWAYS DISLIKED THE OVERLY RIGID DIVISION BETWEEN FIRST-RATERS, SECOND-RATERS AND THIRD-RATERS. THERE ARE INCOMPETENT FOOLS AMONG FIRST-CLASS CITIZENS AND THERE ARE BRILLIANT VISIONARIES AMONG THIRD-CLASS CITIZENS. I HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING EXAMPLES OF BOTH. I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THOSE DESTINED FOR GREATNESS WILL FIND THEIR WAY TO BRIDGE THIS FORCED DIVIDE BETWEEN THE CLASSES. I AM HAPPY TO STATE THAT THE DWARVES THAT I HAVE MET IN PARNEA AGREE WITH MY VIEWS.]

"That is not what I have learned through my own research." Najan Jittar retorted. "According to many testimonies, you generated a lot of controversy when you chose to add yourself into an existing dwarven community. Many local dwarves were opposed to your attempts to annex them to your non-existent empire. It was only through subverting a surprising collection of ace pilots that you managed to force the local dwarven community into handing over its keys to your august self. Is that how a lover of democracy operates?"

That was a sharp and biting question! There was no way that Rion Aaden could make a proper account of himself, as the journalist had only brought up facts.

Still, the Iron Emperor remained unmoved.

[I MADE AN APPEAL TO THE DWARVEN SAINTS. THEY DECIDED TO SUPPORT MY CAUSE AS I OFFERED THEM A PURPOSE THAT WAS GREATER THAN THE PETTY REASONS THEY USED TO FIGHT FOR. I DO NOT CONTROL THEM. THEY ARE TOO POWERFUL FOR THAT. EACH OF THEM POSSESSES A MIND OF THEIR OWN, AND YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO THAT ACE PILOTS CAN NEVER BE TOYED WITH. I APOLOGIZE FOR THE IMPROPER ACTIONS THAT THEY HAVE TAKEN, BUT THEY HAVE DONE SO FOR THE GOOD OF OUR KIND.]

"You are trying to weasel your way out of acknowledging your guilt once again, Your Majesty. It is not difficult to learn that those dwarven ace pilots acted according to your will and goals."

[I AM MERELY A FORMER MECH PILOT AND A FAILED LEADER, AS YOU HAVE SAID. I AM INCOMPARABLY WEAKER TO THE ACE PILOTS AROUND MY PERSON. I DO NOT COMMAND THEM SO MUCH AS THEY COMMAND ME. I CANNOT HELP BUT OCCUPY MYSELF MORE TO BUILDING A BETTER FUTURE FOR OUR DWARVEN PEOPLE UPON THEIR PROMPTING. AS EACH OF THEM ARE AS EACH OF THEM ARE HEROES IN THEIR OWN RIGHT, THEY HAVE QUICKLY AMASSED A FOLLOWING ON MY BEHALF. THE DWARVES THAT HAVE DECIDED TO FOLLOW ME DO SO ON THEIR OWN FREE WILL.]

"Is that truly the case? There are accusations swinging around that your ability to convince dwarven individuals to abandon their old jobs, states and their religions if applicable is uncharacteristically effective. Are you truly leaving the dwarves to choose for themselves or have you brainwashed them into becoming your loyal slaves, just as you did with the tragic citizens of the defunct Vulcan Empire?"
