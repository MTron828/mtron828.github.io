Chapter 511 Divine Moonstone Blade

When the semi-transparent sword appeared in this world, it was as though a treasure was being born in that area, causing all of the Profound Qi in a 1,000 mile radius to gather around Su Yang.

Once the Profound Qi got near Su Yang, the sword trembled, flickering with a profound light, before absorbing all of the Profound Qi nearly instantaneously.

"W-What kind of treasure is that?!"

Not just Fu Kuan, but the rest of the people there were all shocked speechless by the appearance of this mythical treasure.

’Not even the low quality Divine-grade Spiritual Treasure that is my family’s heirloom could emit such a powerful aura!’ Xie Xingfang swallowed nervously.

Above Heaven-grade Spiritual Treasures is the Divine-grade, and in the entire Eastern Continent, there exists only one of this treasure, which belongs to the Xie Family. However, the beautiful sword in Su Yang’s hands emitted an aura that far surpasses the Divine-grade Spiritual Treasure, which only suggests that it’s above even the Divine-grade.

Meanwhile, a few miles away from their location, inside the Profound Blossom Sect, Qiuyue’s eyes snapped open when she felt the unnatural flow of Profound Qi.

"This feeling is..."

She stopped her cultivation, immediately left the house, and she soared towards the Su Yang’s location.

When she was close enough to see the summoned beast and the sword in Su Yang’s hands, her eyes widened with surprise.

’The Divine Moonstone Blade?!’

Qiuyue was surprised to see her sword being used by him. The Divine Moonstone Blade is a treasure that belonged to the Sacred Moon Temple and was once used by Yuehai, her mother. But when she ran away from the Sacred Moon Temple, Qiuyue stole the sword and took it with her. This is another reason why the Sacred Moon Temple was hell-bent on capturing her, as she has one of their most precious treasures.

"Fath— Su Yang! What is going on?" Qiuyue flew right beside him and asked.

"Y-You are!?"

When the other people there saw Qiuyue, their eyes widened with shock.

"The Goddess from that time?!" Xie Xingfang’s body trembled after feeling Qiuyue’s otherworldly presence.

’Who the hell is that? I can feel an ominous feeling coming from her... she’s a dangerous one...’ Fu Kuan stared at Qiuyue with a deep frown. Because the Million Snakes Sect did not linger around after their defeat, Fu Kuan did not know of Qiuyue’s existence.

"Y-You are Su Yang’s Master! If it’s you, who even the Ancestor lowered his head to, you should be able to defeat that monster, right?!" Elder Zhong suddenly said while pointing to the Demonic Blood Serpent.

"Master?" Qiuyue turned to look at him with a frown. "I am not his Master."

She then looked at the Demonic Blood Serpent with raised eyebrows and said, "Peak of the Sovereign Spirit Realm? Although its cultivation base appears to be high, its internal energy is not stable. That thing is as powerful as someone at the second or third level Sovereign Spirit Realm at best."

"So? Do you need me to kill this beast?" She asked Su Yang with an unfazed expression, almost as though the Demonic Blood Serpent was no different than an ordinary snake in her eyes.

"No, this is a good chance for me to test out the full extent of my abilities. Even though I am slightly cheating by using the Divine Moonstone Blade, an Ancient-grade treasure, I currently don’t have any other treasure on hand that can withstand the Asura God Clan’s techniques."

"Asura God Clan’s technique? Don’t tell me you are going to use the same technique you used to scare that little girl?" Qiuyue recalled that time in the Holy Central Continent when he made Wu Jingjing piss her pants by using some sword technique from the Asura God Clan.

Su Yang nodded.

"Can you protect those people down there?" Su Yang’s eyes pointed at the disciples at the examination hall.

Qiuyue nodded and approached them, before creating a powerful defensive formation around them.

"W-What a powerful formation! And she even created it in the blink of an eye!" Liu Lanzhi was dumbfounded by Qiuyue’s ability, wondering if she’s the one Su Yang mentioned that would be helping him with the formation for the Profound Blossom Sect.

"What are you looking at?" Qiuyue looked at her with raised eyebrows.

"Just who are you, really? An Immortal like Su Yang?" Liu Lanzhi asked her in a low voice.

Qiuyue looked at her with narrowed eyes and spoke, "You know his background? Who are you?"

"I-I am the Profound Blossom Sect’s Leader! And yes, he told me a little bit about his background before..." Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

"Is that so?" After staring at Liu Lanzhi for a moment, Qiuyue no longer paid attention to her and returned to watching Su Yang.

Meanwhile, Su Yang said to the other Heavenly Spirit Realm experts, "If you don’t want to get caught up in the blast, I suggest you retreat to the disciples. You’ll be safe there."

"Are you sure that you don’t need any help, Su Yang? Even if it’s dangerous, I am willing to stay behind and help you defeat that beast!" Xie Xingfang asked him with a worried face behind her veil.

No matter how talented he may appear to be, it was simply reckless to fight someone an entire realm stronger than yourself, especially when the opponent is a spiritual beast at the Sovereign Spirit Realm.

Spiritual beasts are known to be naturally stronger than human Cultivators at the same level, so if a Cultivator wanted to defeat a spiritual beast at the first level Sovereign Spirit Realm, the Cultivator would require strength at the second — or even the third level and above to fight it.

Of course, there are genius Cultivators that can fight spiritual beasts above their current level, but those people are too few and far between.

"Don’t worry about me and go to where the others are. Things might get a little bit hectic here in a moment, as I am might not have perfect control over this technique, and I don’t want to hurt you."

After staring at him for a few more moments, Xie Xingfang nodded and made her way into the defensive formation around Qiuyue, as did the other Heavenly Spirit Realm experts.
