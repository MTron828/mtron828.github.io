Chapter 741 Training Cai Yan

"Since that’s the case, I’ll impregnate you. However, I won’t do it today," Su Yang said to Cai Yan.

And he continued, "The only reason the Profound Blossom Sect disciples were able to improve their cultivation so quickly was because they had absorbed my Yang Qi, so if you don’t absorb my Yang Qi, it’ll make the entire process pointless."

"Furthermore, if I impregnate you now, it’ll slow down your training a few months later, even halt it completely until after you give birth. Therefore, I will impregnate you once you have reached the Earth Spirit Realm and finish most of our lectures."

Cai Yan nodded, "I understand. Then I’ll save the Liquid of Fertility until..."

"I don’t need the Liquid of Fertility to impregnate you. Just throw that trash away," Su Yang suddenly said.

If his partners needed something like the Liquid of Fertility to get impregnated by him, it would be a slap to his face, who has spent many years learning and mastering the technique that allowed him to control his Yang Qi and impregnate his partners at will with 100 percent success rate.

"In fact, you can give it to me. I’ll dispose of it for you."

"O-Okay..." Cai Yan nodded with a dazed look before handing him a small bottle of clear liquid.

Once the Liquid of Fertility was in his hands, Su Yang closed his hand and crushed the bottle before using his alchemy flames to erase all of its contents until there was nothing left.

Cai Yan was speechless after witnessing Su Yang destroy the Liquid of Fertility so viciously, acting almost like he was enemies with it or something.

After destroying the Liquid of Fertility, Su Yang looked at Cai Yan before handing her another scroll.

"What’s this?" she asked him.

"That is a cultivation technique for Dual Cultivators. It’s really no different from a normal cultivation technique except for a few extra steps that allow you to absorb the Yang Qi in your body. If you use this technique to absorb the Yang Qi after our cultivation, it’ll be more effective than just absorbing it normally," Su Yang explained to her.

"It won’t take long to learn it— an hour at most even for people with average talents. If it’s you, it’ll take even less. We’ll begin our cultivation once you have learned it."

Cai Yan nodded and immediately began studying the cultivation technique.

Meanwhile, Su Yang sat on the bed and began cultivating.

About twenty minutes later, Cai Yan placed the technique down and said, "Master, I have learned the technique."

Su Yang opened his eyes and immediately began loosening his robes, "Then let’s begin."

Cai Yan blushed a little when she saw Su Yang’s smooth skin and flawless figure for the first time.

"Come over here," Su Yang said to her.

Cai Yan then stood up and loosened her own robes before approaching him.

A few moments later, Cai Yan laid on the bed with her body completely naked and Su Yang staring intimately at her.

"As expected of a young lady from a noble family— you have a very luscious body," Su Yang praised her with a smile on his face before using his fingers and running them down her body.

"Mmm..."

Cai Yan immediately tightened her jaws to resist moaning.

"Don’t hold it in and let it out— you’ll feel much better that way." Su Yang said to her as his fingers reached the bare slit between her legs.

He proceeded to tease the area around the slit until it was soaking wet, causing Cai Yan to moan continuously, "Aaahh~!"

Once her little sister was completely wet and drooling with Yin Qi, Su Yang spread her legs wide open before kissing her slit with his lips and skillfully licking all of the sweet juices with his tongue.

Cai Yan moaned even louder after feeling Su Yang’s tongue licking all over her little sister, feeling an unfamiliar feeling spread throughout her body.

"It’s coming! It’s coming out!"

Cai Yan exclaimed before releasing a long flow of Yin Qi from her slit.

A few moments later once Cai Yan’s body stopped twitching, Su Yang began rubbing his hot and stiff rod between her wet slit, teasing the swollen pink pearl that had been aroused for a while now.

"Master... stick it inside me already... I cannot hold it any longer!" Cai Yan suddenly pleaded with a lustful expression on her elegant face.

Once his dragon was soaked with Cai Yan’s slippery substance, Su Yang poked her sealed entrance with just the tip, spreading it wide open.

"So painful!" Cai Yan sucked in a breath of cold air after feeling an intense pain between her legs for the first time in her life.

"I’m going to go deeper now," Su Yang said to her a moment later.

"Go ahead." Cai Yan nodded.

Su Yang then pushed his meatstick deeper into her cave— until his rod was knocking her at the end of the cave.

Meanwhile, Cai Yan clenched her jaws to endure the pain, and she could even feel the sensation of her own virgin blood sliding down her skin.

"Are you okay?" Su Yang asked her afterward.

"I’m... fine..." she nodded with a resolute expression.

Su Yang nodded, and he began moving his hips, thrusting his meatstick into her slipper yet tight cave and pulling it back out a second later after reaching the end of her cave.

Very quickly, Cai Yan stopped feeling pain and could no longer feel anything else besides pleasure.

"Aaaah~!"

"Aaaaaaahn~!"

"Mmmm~!"

Cai Yan tossed away her graceful character and began moaning without restraints, fully indulging herself in the pleasure that overwhelmed her inexperienced body.

Many minutes later, Su Yang released his Yang Qi into her body, filling every nook and cranny inside her cave.

"Go ahead and cultivate the Yang Qi in your body now. Once you’re done, we’ll do it again, and we’ll continue doing this until you can no longer move. If you want to reach the Earth Spirit Realm quickly, you’ll have to endure this like the disciples had," Su Yang said to her afterward. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Cai Yan nodded and began absorbing the Yang Qi in her body.
