Chapter 766 - Emperor Lian's Resolve

"Are you sure you want me to help you? What about your husband?" Su Yang did not immediately reject Feng Xindou’s request and instead asked her that question.

"Don’t worry, I’ll talk to him about it so there won’t be any problems," Feng Xindou said to him.

"Anway, I’ll be right back!"

Feng Xindou quickly returned to the bedroom where Emperor Lian was getting dressed, and she said to him, "Su Yang and Lian Li are here."

"What? What are the two of them doing here? I didn’t expect them to show up until after the baby was born..." Emperor Lian said with a dumbfounded look on his face.

"I don’t know why they’re here, and there’s no use in guessing when we can just ask them later."

Emperor Lian nodded and prepared to walk outside.

However, Feng Xindou suddenly stopped him and said, "Wait a second, dear."

"What is it? If you’re talking about that, we can finish it once they’re gone."

Feng Xindou shook her head and then said, "To tell you the truth, your techniques are absolutely weak and unsatisfactory, so I went ahead and asked Su Yang to help me relieve my Yin Qi just now, as I feel like I might go crazy if I do not relieve this feeling in my body."

Emperor Lian’s jaw dropped when he heard her words. However, before he could even speak, Feng Xindou continued—

"I know you’re working hard to satisfy me and trying your best to learn the technique as fast as possible, but I am simply left yearning for more every time we do it, and I don’t think I can last any longer like this. Therefore, I suggest that we let Su Yang help me until you are able to satisfy me. This will probably sound like an excuse to you but I... I am really afraid of returning to that condition, and I’d rather die than to live that kind of life again!" Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

"..."

Emperor Lian closed his eyes with his fists tightly clenched together, clearly trying to resist his emotions.

Feng Xindou felt extremely guilty when she saw this, but she really wanted to relieve herself, especially if she might return to her crippled state again.

After a moment of silence, Emperor Lian took a deep breath and released it, relaxing his fists and body.

"I should be the one apologizing, my wife... for being unable to satisfy you. I thought that I was doing a good job because you didn’t complain, but alas, to think I was only satisfying myself this entire time while you are feeling the complete opposite— I am truly sorry for being a useless husband..." Emperor Lian lowered his head at her.

"If you need someone else to relieve you, I won’t blame you, nor will I see it as cheating. In fact, I would even have told you to do the same if I’d known about your situation earlier."

Emperor Lian then continued, "I also cannot bear to see you in that condition again, so do whatever you must. I’ll continue to practice the techniques Su Yang gave me so I won’t lose you permanently. Of course, even if you still decide to leave me afterward, I won’t complain about it."

Feng Xindou covered her mouth when she saw this and even felt the urge to cry.

"You silly, I would never leave you. This is only a temporary treatment. Furthermore, Su Yang belongs to our daughter, Lian Li, and she is even bearing his child right at this moment. Even I am not shameless enough to go after the same man as my daughter."

Emperor Lian nodded, and the two of them went to greet Su Yang after they fixed their appearances.

"Once again, I am sorry for showing up in such an inappropriate appearance before," Feng Xindou said to them.

"Come over here, Su Yang. I would like to speak with you privately for a moment," Emperor Lian then said to him.

Su Yang nodded and followed him to an empty room.

"I have heard everything from my wife, and as much as I hate to admit it, I cannot satisfy my wife despite learning the technique you’ve given me, even doing the complete opposite. I am a complete failure of a husband. Therefore, I am asking you to help me satisfy my wife in my stead," Emperor Lian said to him with a serious look on his face.

Su Yang was speechless. Although this is not the first time he’s had another man asking him to satisfy their wife, it is still an incredibly rare instance.

Emperor Lian continued to speak before Su Yang could open his mouth, "However, don’t be mistaken, Su Yang. I am not giving you my wife! I am merely letting you ’treat’ her until I can do it myself! And I swear it won’t be long before you are no longer necessary in my wife’s life!"

Su Yang smiled after hearing his words, and he said, "Are you sure? She might not want to return to your side if you make her wait too long."

Emperor Lian clenched his teeth together when he heard Su Yang’s words, as that was what he feared the most in this situation.

"That won’t happen!" Emperor Lian claimed in a confident voice.

"Oh? What makes you so confident? I’ll let you know that I am also pretty confident in my experience with stealing wives from their husbands. If I am serious, I can steal Feng Xindou from you in a single night," Su Yang said with a villainous grin on his face.

"..." Emperor Lian’s heart trembled after seeing Su Yang’s evil grin, and he could somehow tell that Su Yang wasn’t bragging nor joking. If Su Yang really wanted to take Feng Xindou from him, there was nothing he could do to stop Su Yang!

"I’m joking," Su Yang suddenly said, dumbfounding Emperor Lian.

"I really admire your ability to let another man go near your wife because I certainly wouldn’t be able to do the same, so I won’t steal her from you. I am satisfied with just Lian Li since she’s an amazing woman."

"However, if you cannot master the technique before I leave this world in one year, I’ll definitely steal her from you no matter what you say because I would be harming her— even killing her by letting her stay with someone who cannot help her condition. Do you understand me?" Su Yang said to Emperor Lian with a serious look on his face.

Emperor Lian nodded with a resolute expression.
