Chapter 793 - Teleport Formation

After they settled down in this private pavilion, Su Yang proceeded to spend the next three days there speaking with Xian Ni, telling him about the Divine Heavens and Immortals, even giving him advice on cultivation, which greatly benefited Xian Ni by expanding his knowledge and overall standard for cultivation.

"I can’t believe that there’s such a vast world beyond this sky and nobody here is aware of here..." Xian Ni sighed as he stared at the blue sky blankly, looking like someone who was yearning for something.

"Do you... do you think it’s possible for one to escape this world and travel to that cultivation world? This place... I feel like it’s too small even though I have never left the Western Continent."

"And with the Jade Sea strictly restricting my movements, it feels as though only the Western Continent exists in this world."

Su Yang pondered, "There’s nothing you nor I can do anything about the Jade Sea— at least not at our level. However, there are methods that can allow you to traverse to the other continents without needing to worry about the Jade Sea."

"Eh? Really? How can we do something like that?!" Xian Ni asked with his eyes flickering with excitement. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

"Although it’ll take a bit of effort and resources, one can create a teleport formation on all continents, and as long as you feed it enough spirit stones, you’ll be able to teleport from one continent to another almost instantly," Su Yang said.

"T-That sounds... a bit impossible, doesn’t it? First of all, we would need someone who can travel to all continents as well as create the teleport formations. And even if there exists someone who meets that criteria, how many years would it take for that individual to create these formations? I don’t know much about formations but formations of that level must require decades if not centuries to create!"

"Additionally, I can already imagine the immense amount of wealth that is required to activate these formations."

Su Yang shrugged and said, "Well, I can create these formations on all continents in less than a month if you want. As for the spirit stones, although it’ll be costly, one cannot expect to travel such a distance every day, as it’s a luxury to use teleport formations even in the Divine Heavens."

"H-How much do you think it’ll cost for each use?" Xian Ni asked him a moment later.

Su Yang pondered for a bit before raising 1 finger and said, "Probably around 1 million spirit stones for each use, maybe a little bit more if the place you’re going to is further than the rest."

"One million spirit stones is definitely not a small number, but it’s doable if we travel sparingly." Xian Ni said with a profound look on his face.

He then looked at Su Yang and asked, "If I asked you, would you be willing to create these formations? I don’t mind paying for them as well."

Su Yang nodded and said, "I’d already planned on doing this before our conversation so you don’t need to pay me. However, I cannot just create these formations without permission from these continents, so I’ll ask the ruler of each continent to see whether they’ll allow for these formations to exist in their continent. If they don’t want visitors from other continents, there’s nothing I can really do about it since I don’t want it to feel like an invasion."

"What do you think? Will your Xian Family allow me to create a teleport formation in the Western Continent, connecting to the other continents?" Su Yang asked Xian Ni.

Xian Ni immediately nodded and said, "Of course! This is going to be revolutionary! The five continents have been separated from each other since ancient times, and I can only imagine what might happen once we’re allowed to visit each other for the first time! I am already excited for this even if only one other continent agrees with this!"

"Li’er, what do you think? Do you think your family will agree with this change?" Su Yang turned to ask her.

Lian Li nodded and said, "If you’re the one asking, most likely."

’W-Wait a second... Her family governs the Holy Central Continent?’ Xian Ni looked at Lian Li with wide eyes, as this is his first time hearing such a thing, and he’d thought that she was just some beauty from the Holy Central Continent!

"So we have the Western Continent, Holy Central Continent, and the Eastern Continent willing to have visitors, leaving only the Southern Continent and the Northern Continent." Su Yang mumbled.

"Hm? How do you know that the Eastern Continent will agree to this?" Xian Ni asked him. "Do you also have ties with the ruler there?"

Su Yang nodded and responded in a calm manner, "Yes, I i.m.p.r.e.g.n.a.t.ed their daughter so I am already a part of their family."

"You..." Xian Ni looked at Su Yang with dropped jaws, completely speechless by the casual way he’d said those shocking words.

"When will you be putting this plan in motion?" Xian Ni asked him sometime later.

"Probably sometime after I return to the Eastern Continent," Su Yang said. "But you can expect it to finish before the end of this year."

"That’s very soon! I cannot wait for this!" Xian Ni clenched his hands into a fist that trembled from excitement. As someone who has lived for over a thousand years, waiting for another year wouldn’t matter at all.

Su Yang nodded and said, "Anyway, it’s about time for that tournament to start, right?"

"Yes, the tournament should be starting in a few hours. Shall we head there now? After all, we still have to register your name."

Sometime later, Su Yang and the group began making their way back to Immortal City.

"Wow, this place looks entirely different with so many people appearing out of the blue," Lian Li mumbled in a low voice after seeing millions of people trying to enter the city, and the city itself was crowded with people.
