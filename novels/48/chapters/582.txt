Chapter 583 Golden Lion Academy“s Invasion 3

"..."

After being hit by Xiao Rong’s breath, Xie Wang landed a few miles away from the Profound Blossom Sect with a few broken bones in his body.

He laid on the ground with a dazed expression, seemingly speechless about what has just happened.

’Are people from the Holy Central Continent all this powerful?’ he pondered inwardly.

If he traveled to the Holy Central Continent, will he also be able to cultivate to such an extreme level?

"Ugh... I haven’t experienced this kind of injury for over a hundred years..." Xie Wang struggled to even get on his feet, before flying back to the Profound Blossom Sect.

"Grandfather! Are you okay?!" Xie Xingfang showed a surprised face when she saw his messy appearance, looking like he’d just fallen down a cliff.

"I have a few broken bones, but it’s nothing life threatening..." he sighed.

Once Xie Wang returned, Su Yang extended his hand and offered a pill to him.

"Take this pill, it’ll help you with your internal injuries."

Xie Wang nodded.

However, he did not immediately swallow the pill and silently admired the flawless-looking pill in his hand for a few moments, as this is his first time seeing a pill with such few impurities inside if there were any at all.

’Whoever crafted this pill must be a peak Alchemy Master...’ Xie Wang silently paid respect to the creator of this pill before swallowing it.

"So potent!" He exclaimed in a shocked voice when all of his internal injury healed within just a few seconds after swallowing the pill.

"Where did you obtain this pill?" he asked Su Yang afterward.

"Not sure. I think I picked it up on the side of the road sometime ago." Su Yang casually shrugged.

"...Just say so if you don’t want to tell me." Xie Wang shook his head.

"Anyway, I admit defeat, and I also want to apologize for looking down on you because of your young appearance. I’m sorry, Senior." Xie Wang bowed to Xiao Rong, who remained nonchalant. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

"Now that you are aware of her abilities, let’s head to the location." Su Yang said, and he turned to look at Xiao Rong. "Which direction are they coming from?"

Xiao Rong quickly pointed to the south.

"It will take at least an entire month to reach the Southern Sea from here even if we fly there nonstop..." Xie Wang said.

"Qiuyue, let’s use your flying ship." Su Yang said to her.

She nodded and retrieved her large flying ship.

She then tossed the flying ship into the air, and it expanded until it was the size of a real ship.

While Xie Wang and Xie Xingfang admired the flying ship, Su Yang and the others boarded it.

Sometime later, when everyone was on the ship, Qiuyue used her spiritual energy to navigate the ship towards the south.

Meanwhile, the disciples within the Profound Blossom Sect were shocked speechless when a massive ship suddenly appeared above their Sect, and it was only after Liu Lanzhi explained to them the situation did they finally calm down.

"What a mythical treasure!"

When Su Yang and the group arrived at the Southern Sea in just a few minutes, Xie Wang expressed his admiration for the flying ship, as he had never experienced moving this fast before, nor did he imagine that it would be possible.

And while Xie Wang was focused on the flying ship, Xie Xingfang pointed towards the sandy land that was right before the Jade Sea, and she spoke, "Look at the people gathered over there! They are the Moonlight Blades!"

"What?! Let me see!" Xie Wang quickly walked beside her and looked at where she was pointing, and he could see at glance over a hundred people wearing the Moonlight Blades’ uniform camping near the Jade Sea.

"Those bastards must be waiting for the people from the Holy Central Continent! It seems like we have come to the right place! I should go down there and kill every last one of them!" Xie Wang’s eyes flickered with killing intent.

"Wait a second." Su Yang suddenly stopped him, and he said, "We can kill them after we gather some information."

"Su Yang, can I come with you? I’d also like to have a word with them." Xie Xingfang suddenly said.

"Of course." He nodded.

Meanwhile, at the Moonlight Blades’ camping area, they quickly noticed the massive flying ship that appeared out of nowhere without making a single sound, almost as though it was a ghost ship.

"W-What the heck is that?!"

"How did it get there without making any noises?!"

They were baffled by this phenomenon.

A few moments later, they noticed three figures jumping off this flying ship and slowly descending towards their direction.

And when they saw Xie Xingfang’s face among those three figures, the Moonlight Blade was immediately alerted.

"W-What’s she doing here?!"

"Look beside her! That’s Xie Wang! The Xie Family’s Ancestor!"

"Impossible! How did the Xie Family find us?!"

"Fuck! It’s over! We’re all dead!"

The Moonlight Blades began panicking with some even running away.

However, before they could flee very far, Su Yang waved his sleeves, instantly creating a restriction array around them, entrapping them in a semi-transparent barrier.

"What the hell is this?!"

"Let me out of here, you bastard!"

"T-That’s Su Yang?! What’s he doing here with the Xie Family?!"

A few people in the Moonlight Blades recognized Su Yang’s handsome face.

"Give it up. You won’t break the formation even if all of you attack it for a year straight." Su Yang said to them as he approached them.

"What do you want from us?!" One of them asked him.

"I only have a few questions for you." He calmly responded.

"If we answer your questions, will you let us go?"

Su Yang nodded and said, "Of course. If you answer all of my questions, I will remove the formation and let you all go. However, if you lie even once, I will slaughter every single one of you."
