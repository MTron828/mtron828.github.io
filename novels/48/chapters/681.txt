Chapter 682 Conquering Holy Central Continent“s Top 3 Beauties

After leaving Wu Jingjing’s house and the Holy Sword Academy, Su Yang returned to the Four Seasons Academy with Lian Li on his flying boat.

Once they returned to the Sect, Su Yang went straight to Zhu Mengyi’s living quarters and knocked on the door.

"Su Yang! Welcome back—" Zhu Mengyi opened the door to greet Su Yang with Zhu Jiayi in her arms, but her words were cut short when she noticed the peerless beauty standing beside him.

"Y-Y-Y-Your Highness?!" Zhu Mengyi cried out loud, nearly dropping Zhu Jiayi from shock. "What are you doing here?! And with Su Yang?!"

"Let’s talk inside," Su Yang said to her with a calm smile on his face.

"O-Okay..." Zhu Mengyi nodded.

Sometime later, the three of them sat down in the living room.

"W-Would you like some tea, Your Highness...?" Zhu Mengyi asked her in a nervous tone, as she wasn’t prepared for Lian Li’s presence.

"There’s no need to be so humble, Mengyi. After all, you’re both my woman," Su Yang said to her. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

"E-Excuse me...?" Zhu Mengyi looked at him and then Lian Li with her eyes as wide as saucers.

"Wait a second, you’re also his partner?" Lian Li was also surprised to hear this. Then she looked at the beautiful little girl in Zhu Mengyi’s embrace and continued, "D-Don’t tell me that’s also..."

"That’s right. She’s also my daughter." Su Yang spoke in a prideful voice.

"Unbelievable... Not only did you manage to impregnate Master Wu’s daughter but you also impregnated Senior Zhu’s daughter, Zhu Mengyi? How many more women out there had been impregnated by you?" Lian Li looked at him with a look of disbelief. How did a single man conquer the top 3 beauties in the Holy Central Continent by himself? Calling it a miracle would be an understatement!

"As expected of you, Su Yang... Even the princess cannot resist your charms..." Zhu Mengyi said as she looked at him with admiration.

"..."

Lian Li narrowed her eyes at Zhu Mengyi, but there was nothing she could say, as it was true that both her heart and body had been conquered by Su Yang.

"Oh, right. Su Yang, I have a favor to ask of you. I tried speaking to my mother, but she’s not happy about me leaving with Zhu Jiayi, and I didn’t dare to tell her your real background without your permission so can you speak with her for me?" Zhu Mengyi suddenly said to him.

Su Yang nodded and said, "Okay, I can speak with her before I speak with the Xie Family."

"I will be back," Su Yang then left the building, leaving Zhu Mengyi and Lian Li alone.

"..."

"..."

"..."

After a long moment of awkward silence, Lian Li suddenly spoke, "Can you tell me about your relationship with Su Yang?"

Zhu Mengyi nodded, and she proceeded to give Lian Li a brief explanation of her meeting with Su Yang and how they ended up giving birth to Zhu Jiayi.

"I see..." Lian Li mumbled after listening to Zhu Mengyi’s story, and she asked a moment later, "Then can you tell me about Su Yang’s real background?"

"That’s..." Zhu Mengyi immediately hesitated. Even though Lian Li was the princess and also Su Yang’s woman, she didn’t dare to reveal his real background.

"With all due respect, Your Highness, I cannot tell you about his background. And I think it would be better if you asked Su Yang since it would mean a lot more if you heard it from him. I’m also confident that he wouldn’t say no."

"..."

Lian Li turned silent. Just what kind of background does Su Yang have that even Zhu Mengyi wouldn’t dare to reveal?

"I understand. I’m sorry if I’d put you in an awkward spot just now." Lian Li said to her a moment later.

’Huh? Is it just me or does Her Highness feel a little different than before? It’s almost like she’s less overbearing and hard to approach...’ Zhu Mengyi wondered inwardly.

Meanwhile, Su Yang just reached Sect Master Zhu’s room.

"Su Yang, huh. I’m guessing Zhu Mengyi asked you to speak with me," she sighed after seeing him.

"That’s right. You want to know where she’ll be going, right?" Su Yang said.

"No, I wanted her to tell me the truth, as it was clear that she was hiding something from me."

"Then allow me to tell you in her stead, as this is related to me in the first place."

Su Yang took a deep but calm breath before continuing, "As you know, I am from the Eastern Continent. However, that is not entirely true, as I came from another place before arriving at the Eastern Continent."

"What do you mean by that?" Sect Master Zhu raised her eyebrows.

"What I am trying to say is— I am actually a Cultivator who came from another world that exists somewhere within the starry sky, and the reason why Zhu Mengyi might not be able to visit you in the future is because it might be impossible to return to this world once we leave."

"You... what?!"

Sect Master Zhu immediately stood up with a shocked face.

"That’s right. There exist other worlds in this endless universe. If you want a simpler term, then one can say that I have come from a ’higher realm’."

Su Yang then continued, "Sit down and I’ll tell you more about it."

Sect Master Zhu nodded in a dazed manner before sitting down in a falling motion.

Seeing this, Su Yang chuckled, and he began telling her about the existence of the Four Divine Heavens and even Immortal Fairy Su Yue’s real identity and their real relationship.

Many minutes later.

"Good heavens! No wonder why Immortal Fairy Su Yue is so powerful! It turns out that she actually came from another world where the Cultivation world is much more advanced than this place! It all makes sense now!" Sect Master Zhu exclaimed, feeling chills all over her body after learning about the Divine Heavens.
