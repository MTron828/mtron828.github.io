Chapter 852 - Impregnating Cai Yan

"P-Please, come inside, Master!" Cai Yan said to him in a dazed voice after a moment of silence.

A few moments later, Su Yang entered the building and went to Cai Yan’s bedroom with her.

"You’re going to i.m.p.r.e.g.n.a.t.e me today?" Cai Yan asked him just in case she misheard him.

"That’s right. Unless you don’t want to bear my child anymore. In that case, I’ll just cultivate with you normally like usual."

"I want to conceive your child, Master!" Cai Yan quickly responded.

Su Yang nodded and began removing his clothes, "Then let’s get to it, shall we?"

Cai Yan immediately followed him and removed her clothes as well.

The two of them went onto the bed shortly after, and Su Yang began feeling Cai Yan all over her body with his hands, c.a.r.e.s.sing her smooth skin as though he was handling a treasure.

Cai Yan’s body trembled with delight in response, and Su Yang began kissing her b.r.e.a.s.ts a few moments later.

"Mmm..." Cai Yan m.o.a.n.e.d in a soft and gentle voice.

Her m.o.a.ning grew slightly louder when Su Yang began teasing her pink circle with his tongue, eventually s.u.c.k.i.n.g on it like a baby would when trying to drink milk.

While he teased her b.r.e.a.s.ts with his mouth, Su Yang also teased Cai Yan’s little sister with his fingers, rubbing the slit and the pink pearl. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

"Aaaah~!"

Cai Yan stretched her body and toes at the intense p.l.e.a.s.u.r.e that assaulted her body.

A few minutes of teasing later, Su Yang poked her cave with his large rod, spreading it wide open with just the tip of his rod.

Su Yang then pushed his heavenly rod deeper and deeper into Cai Yan’s cave, creating a bulge on her stomach.

Once his rod was fully inserted inside Cai Yan’s cave, Su Yang began moving his h.i.p.s, thrusting his rod in and out of her cave as well.

"Aaaah~!"

While Cai Yan fully indulged herself with Su Yang’s stiff rod, Su Yang, in return, pleased himself with her soft and wet cave that gushed with Yin Qi with every thrust.

Su Yang pounded Cai Yan from the front for almost an hour before flipping her around and doing her from behind.

He firmly grasped her round and pale b.u.t.t.o.c.k.s with his claw-like hands, helping her follow his rhythm.

Many minutes later, Su Yang released his Yang Qi into Cai Yan’s cave, filling her body with his seeds.

"Am I going to be pregnant now?" Cai Yan asked him afterward.

"Not yet," Su Yang said with a smile on his face. "We’re going to enjoy this a little more before I i.m.p.r.e.g.n.a.t.e you."

Thus, the two of them continued to cultivate for a couple more hours.

Many hours later, once Cai Yan’s body could no longer endure any more p.l.e.a.s.u.r.e, Su Yang released his fertile Yang Qi inside her cave.

Afterward, Su Yang covered her slit with a talisman, sealing his Yang Qi inside her body.

"You should be pregnant soon," Su Yang said to her.

"Thank you, Master... Thank you for giving me this gift..." Cai Yan said to him with slightly teary eyes.

Although she only wanted a child to fulfill her parents’ wish at first, the more she cultivated with Su Yang, the more she wanted a child with him, and this feeling wasn’t influenced by her parents’ will.

"Don’t even mention it. And Cai Yan, I will leave the future of alchemy in this world to you and Luo Yixiao once I leave this world." Su Yang said to her.

"I understand, Master."

A few minutes later, he arrived at Snowfall City, and he went straight to the Xie Family.

"What’s the matter, Su Yang? Do you need something?" Lord Xie asked him.

"Do you remember that celebration you wanted to do for Xing’er? Well, my breakthrough and the meeting has passed. We can celebrate whenever." Su Yang said to him.

"Oh! I’d completely forgotten about this! Thank you for reminding me, Su Yang!" Lord Xie exclaimed after realization.

"When do you want to do it? We need at least a week for the preparations, and we also need to give people time to prepare after the invitations." Lord Xie said to him.

"You can decide. And take your time. I still have three more months in this world," said Su Yang.

"How does next month sound? And coincidentally, next month is Xing’er’s birthday. We can celebrate your children and her birthday at the same time." Lord Xie suggested.

"Next month, huh? Sounds good." Su Yang nodded.

"Great! Can you let Xing’er know? I’ll start the preparations now!"

"I see... Does this count as our wedding as well?" Xie Xingfang chuckled merrily after hearing the news.

Su Yang nodded and said, "It can be if you want it to be."

"Then I’ll have to start preparing for my wedding dress now."

"No need to rush things. Let’s spend some time together first." Su Yang said as he entered the bed with a smile on his face.

"Let me put the babies into their crib first." Xie Xingfang got off the bed and placed the twins into their crib beside the bed before removing her clothes.

However, Su Yang stopped her as she loosened her clothes, and he said to her, "Why don’t we do this in the bathtub?"

"The bath?" Xie Xingfang raised her eyebrows.

"I have some new medicine that I want you to experience." Su Yang said with a mysterious smile on his face.

"If that’s the case, let me get someone to look after the twins first." Xie Xingfang then went outside before returning a couple of minutes later with Xie Wang by her side.

"I can’t believe you’d disturb my cultivation just so I can look after your children while you have fun with Su Yang..." Xie Wang mumbled in a low voice.

"Why are you complaining when you were the one who said to call you whenever I want someone to look after the children no matter what you’re doing, grandfather?" Xie Xingfang said to him.
