Chapter 694 Four Elements Roo

"W-Wait a second! W-What do you mean by that? Does this mean you and Su Yang already...?" Feng Xindou stared at Lian Li with a gawking expression.

"Yes, I have taken her Pure Yin Essence," Su Yang said in a calm voice.

"..." Lian Li’s face flushed with redness as her parents stared at her with intensive gazes.

"Anyway, I may be from the Eastern Continent, but I am actually from another world that exists beyond this starry sky," Su Yang suddenly said, causing the Lian Family to stare at him with wide eyes.

"There’s no need to look so surprised. In fact, I am not the only person in this world that came from beyond the starry sky. The person you all know as ’Immortal Fairy Su Yue’ is also not from this world."

"Immortal Fairy Su Yue!" Emperor Lian mumbled in a surprised voice.

"Well, since you know my real background now, do you still want to come with me? If you decide to leave this world with me, I can’t guarantee you that you’ll be able to return to this world," Su Yang said while looking at Lian Li, who held a dazed look on her beautiful face.

"I..." Lian Li didn’t dare to make the decision by herself and turned to look at her parents for help.

However, Emperor Lian deliberately turned his head away so they couldn’t make eye contact. As for Feng Xindou, she had a look on her face that said: "Do you really need our help with such an obvious choice?"

Seeing this, Lian Li showed a bittersweet smile on her face before she turned to look at Su Yang and spoke, "If you don’t mind bringing me with you, I am willing to follow you no matter where or how far you go in the starry sky."

Hearing her words, Su Yang nodded with a smile on his face, "I will never refuse company from a beauty, especially one at your quality."

"Does that mean..." Lian Li’s eyes flickered with excitement.

"Yes, I’ll bring you with me if that’s what you truly want."

"Thank you, Su Yang!" Lian Li quickly ran to him and gave him a passionate embrace.

Meanwhile, Xie Wang nudged Xie Xingfang with his elbow and mumbled to her, "If someone like Lian Li could accept Su Yang for who he is, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t be able to do the same. However, at the end of the day, it all depends on how much you want to be with him."

"..." Xie Xingfang did not say anything and merely nodded her head in silence, her expression looking like she was thinking about many things.

Sometime later, the Heavenly Spirit Realm Cultivators returned while carrying a 6-feet long golden box, "Your Majesty, we have brought the Four Elements Root!"

Emperor Lian nodded and said, "Give it to Su Yang."

Once the golden box was in his hands, Su Yang opened it to reveal the Four Elements Root that looked like an oversized root with four long roots, each a different color that resembled the four elements— water, fire, earth, and wind.

"Wow... I would’ve never imagined the Four Elements Root would turn out to be this massive of a treasure... It’s taller than most adult humans!" Xie Wang expressed his awe after seeing the Four Elements Root for the first time.

"Are you satisfied with this? If there’s anything else you need, just let me know and I will try my best to get it for you." Emperor Lian said to him sometime later. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

"Since you mentioned it, I won’t be humble." Su Yang then retrieved a brush and piece of paper and wrote the names of a few ingredients onto it before handing it to Emperor Lian.

"These are..."

A few beads of sweat appeared on Emperor Lian’s forehead after he finished reading Su Yang’s list.

"You really weren’t lying when you said you won’t be humble..."

"What? You can’t do it?" Su Yang said with a smile on his face.

Emperor Lian closed his eyes and took a deep breath before speaking, "Despite the fact that everything you listed here is worth more than the Four Elements Root since you saved my wife’s life, I will help you this once."

"It’ll also take a few weeks to gather these items, too."

Su Yang nodded, "That’s fine. I’ll have someone come pick it up once it’s ready."

Su Yang then looked at the Xie Family and said, "Now that we have the Four Elements Root, are you ready to return to the Eastern Continent?"

"While I would love to stay here for a bit longer, we still have to heal Xing’er condition." Xie Wang stood up and said.

"You’re leaving already, Su Yang? Why don’t you stay here for a few more days?" Feng Xindou asked him, seemingly reluctant to see him go so quickly.

"I would love to, but I am currently in the process of treating her, so I’ll have to return another time," Su Yang said as he pointed at Xie Xingfang.

"Oh... I apologize, young lady... I didn’t know you were his patient, too..." Feng Xindou said to Xie Xingfang.

"It’s okay," Xie Xingfang shook her head.

"Well, knowing Su Yang, he’ll definitely be able to treat whatever problems that you may have, as I have personally experienced his abilities." Feng Xindou said.

"I know... I also trust that Su Yang will be able to help me recover," Xie Xingfang said with a smile on her face.

’This girl... she’s definitely a worthy rival for my daughter...’ Feng Xindou thought to herself after seeing Xie Xingfang’s noble demeanor.

"Lian Li!"

Feng Xindou suddenly approached her and embraced her. "I won’t apologize for slapping you just now since you still wronged Su Yang, but I hope you can become someone important to him, and I won’t forgive you if you ever return here empty-handed."

"Empty-handed...?" Lian Li looked at her mother with a confused expression on her face.

"I’m talking about my grandchildren, you silly!" Feng Xindou chuckled, immediately making Lian Li blush. "I better be a grandmother the next time we meet! Don’t even come back here if you don’t have my grandchildren with you!"

"I... I understand, mother..." Lian Li nodded with her face blooming with redness.
