Chapter 810 - Lu Youyi

After retrieving the pill from the cauldron, Su Yang approached the bed with the young lady, and he said in a calm voice, "It’s going to get a little ugly in just a moment, but there’s no need to panic."

"W-What do you mean by ’ugly’?" Lu Jin couldn’t help but ask him.

However, Su Yang didn’t respond to her question and crushed the pill with his mouth before drinking some liquid and kissing the young lady, forcefully pushing the liquid down her throat. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Once the medicine was inside the young lady’s stomach, Su Yang’s body suddenly exploded with Sword Intent, shocking the people there.

"What do you think you’re doing?!" Lu Duhan exclaimed and unconsciously approached Su Yang.

However, he was quickly blocked by Lian Li, who shook her head and said to him in a calm voice, "Trust him."

Lu Duhan narrowed his eyes, and he nodded with a nervous look on his face.

Meanwhile, after releasing his Sword Intent, Su Yang used it to cut the bulging black veins that were on the young lady’s body, causing her blood to spray all over the place.

"Oooh..." Lu Jin fainted in her husband’s embrace after witnessing this scene.

"A-Are you sure..." Lu Duhan couldn’t help but question the situation.

Lian Li did not say anything and merely nodded her head.

A few seconds later, once her black blood began turning red, Su Yang retrieved another pill from his storage ring and fed it to her, quickly healing the sword cuts on her body.

Su Yang then turned around to look at the dazed Lu Duhan and said to him, "Your daughter’s life is no longer in danger, but she’ll still need extensive care for the next few days before she’s fully recovered."

"T-Thank you, esteemed guest!" Lu Duhan quickly said to him.

Su Yang nodded and said, "We can talk later."

"Patriarch Ji! Please bring them to the guest room! We’ll be with you in a bit!" Lu Duhan said to him.

Ji Hong nodded, and he brought Su Yang to another room a few minutes later.

"I don’t even know where to begin, Senior..." Ji Hong lowered his head to Su Yang after they entered the guest room.

"Don’t even mention it; it isn’t that big of a deal." Su Yang casually shrugged it off. In his eyes, saving a beautiful young lady from pain was as natural as breathing.

A couple of hours later, the Lu Family reappeared before them, and both Lu Duhan and Lu Jin lowered their heads to Su Yang.

"I’m sorry for making you wait so long, and thank you, esteemed guest, for saving our precious daughter. If she’d died... I don’t even want to imagine that..." They said to him.

Su Yang then said, "You can thank me by listening to what I have to say."

Lu Duhan nodded and said, "Of course! Whatever you need!"

Once they were all seated, Su Yang proceeded to explain to them the reason he appeared before them.

"A teleport formation that connects all five continents?" The Lu Family looked at Su Yang with wide eyes afterward, seemingly speechless.

Su Yang continued, "This will allow the people of each continent to finally start communicating with each other. Although it won’t be easily accessible at first, in the future, it’ll definitely be used daily even if it might be a little expensive."

"I will also arrange a meeting for the five continents so the largest and most influential families from each place can talk it out."

Lu Duhan and Lu Jin looked at each other. After pondering for a moment, they nodded and said, "Okay, we’ll participate in this meeting and decide from there."

Then Lu Jin continued, "By the way, esteemed guest, if this is not too much to ask, can you watch over our daughter for a couple more days until she’s more stable? You can stay here in the meantime, and we’ll even compensate you for your time."

Su Yang nodded and said, "A true doctor will never leave their patient before seeing signs of improvement, and you don’t need to compensate me. Unless you have one of the things that’s on this list, I don’t need it."

Su Yang then handed them the medicine list.

The Lu Family looked over it before shaking their head, "Unfortunately, we don’t have anything like this..."

"Then don’t worry about it. I didn’t help your daughter because I want your treasures," said Su Yang.

"T-Thank you! Thank you very much, esteemed guest!" The Lu Family bowed to him again.

Thus, Su Yang decided to stay in the Lu Family’s household for a few more days to look over their daughter.

"How are you feeling?" Su Yang visited the patient early the following day.

"I am feeling much better thanks to you, savior..." The young lady said to him with a humble smile on her face.

"You can call me Su Yang," he said.

"My name is Lu Youyi..."

Su Yang nodded and said, "I brought some more medicine with me. Eat this, and I’ll massage your body in a few hours to squeeze the leftover poison out. Although I’d managed to expel most of the Three Seasons Snake’s poison from your body yesterday, there are still some left."

"Thank you, Su Yang..."

After eating the medicine Su Yang provided her, Lu Youyi returned to her sleep and Su Yang went back to his room until a few hours later.

"Are you ready?" Su Yang asked her after he returned to her room a couple of hours later.

"Yes. Please take care of me." Lu Youyi nodded in a bashful manner as she removed the blanket that was covering her.

Su Yang’s eyebrows raised a little bit when he noticed that Lu Youyi was n.a.k.e.d underneath the blanket. However, he didn’t say anything and approached her.

A few moments later, Su Yang began massaging Lu Youyi’s body, and despite her efforts to remain silent, she was unable to resist the pleasure from Su Yang’s massage and began m.o.a.ning out loud shortly later.
