Chapter 502 Profound Blossom Sect“s Disciple Examination 3

"Do you know that girl, Su Yang?" Lin Na noticed him staring at this new participant and asked him.

"Yes, we had a few moments together in the past," he nodded.

"Do you think she will pass the exam?"

"Who knows," he responded with a slight smile.

Meanwhile, this young lady sat in the red mist, desperately fighting the Demon Heart Pill’s influence within her mind.

Thirty seconds later, she managed to resist the Demon Heart Pill and pass the second exam along with three other individuals.

On the third stage, those three individuals went first, and unsurprisingly, their blood caused no changes to the bowl of water, failing on the stop.

When the young lady mixed her blood with the water, the water turned into a pale red color, before turning into a slightly darker red over time.

"You pass." Su Liqing said to her with a smile.

The young lady bowed to her before walking onto the final stage.

A few moments later, she stood a few meters away from Su Yang and Lin Na on the fourth stage.

And just as Lin Na prepared to fight her, Su Yang tapped on her shoulder from behind and said, "Let me handle this one."

Lin Na nodded and stepped back without saying anything.

"It’s been a while, Su Yang." The young lady said to him with a smile. "You have changed significantly since the last time I saw you. Though, I cannot say the same for myself."

"You’ve become prettier, Lu Lifen," he said with a handsome smile. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

"And you are as slick as ever."

Indeed, this pretty young lady was Lu Lifen, someone he’d met at the Chamber of Embrace when he was still a mere Inner Court Disciple.

And not only did he pluck her Pure Yin Essence, but he also spent two whole days with her.

Lu Lifen continued to speak, "I didn’t tell you this before, but it was my Father’s idea to send me to the Profound Blossom Sect to look for a partner. I wasn’t aware of this at that time, but it was actually a form of punishment for me, who refused to accept a husband despite my parents’ pressure."

"He wanted to make me angry by making me feel humiliation, and I must say, it’d worked perfectly. Of course, he didn’t actually expect me to give my body away like that."

"In other words, my Father didn’t plan for me to find a partner at the Profound Blossom Sect. But alas, I met you, and I gave my body to you."

"I didn’t mention this to my Father when I returned home since I did not find a husband, and he continued to set up marriage meetings for me. Eventually, he found out the truth when he asked Elder Lu, who was with me at the Chamber of Embrace."

"My Father was livid when he found out that I was no longer a maiden, but there was nothing he could do to change that fact, so he accepted the results and no longer bothered me to find a husband, as women that are no longer pure are not desired by big families. Of course, this allowed me to focus on my cultivation wholeheartedly, and I cannot thank you enough for that, Su Yang."

"By the way, although it is also my Father’s idea to have me join the Profound Blossom Sect, I would’ve still come here even if he didn’t say anything."

Lu Lifen suddenly pointed her fingers at him and said, "Su Yang, I am going to become a disciple of the Profound Blossom Sect, and then I am going to make you take responsibility for taking my chastity by making you my husband!"

Su Yang showed a calm smile after hearing her words and said, "I will look forward to it."

Lu Lifen nodded and continued with a smile on her beautiful face, "After this is all over, why don’t we drink some tea together? Just like last time."

"Sounds good."

The two of them began fighting each other a few moments later.

Sometime later, Lu Lifen collapsed on the ground with an exhausted face.

Su Yang approached her and extended his hands for her.

"Congratulations. You have achieved the first part. Now how are you going to make me your husband?" he asked her as he pulled her to her feet.

"By making you fall madly in love with me, of course!" Lu Lifen suddenly shoved her face towards Su Yang and kissed him on the lips briefly.

"Kissing your Sect Master, that’s quite bold of you." Su Yang said afterward.

"If you didn’t want it, you could’ve easily dodged it," she said with a smile.

"I won’t deny that," he replied with a slight chuckle.

"I will see you in seven days, Su Yang." Lu Lifen said before leaving the place a few moments later.

"What a bold girl, kissing Su Yang before so many people." Bai Lihua mumbled after witnessing the scene.

"Isn’t she the youngest daughter from the Lu Family? I have done business with them before." Wang Shuren said, and she continued, "I didn’t expect them to have such a relationship."

Meanwhile, Xie Xingfang’s eyebrows slightly trembled, clearly shaken by the kiss between Lu Lifen and Su Yang.

’If not for my stature, then perhaps I could also act with such boldness...’ she sighed inwardly.

The disciples’ examination continued, and by the end of the first day, over twenty thousand participants had participated and failed the exam with more than 90% of them failing at the second stage.

Furthermore, amongst those twenty thousand people, less than 1% had actually managed to pass the exam and become a disciple of the Profound Blossom Sect.

"169 disciples on the first day, huh? It’s going much better than I’d anticipated." Su Yang nodded with a satisfied expression.

"You are satisfied with so few people passing?" Lin Na was dumbfounded.

"Although 169 people may not seem like a lot of people, if you look at each of them as a genius and a potential Heavenly Spirit Realm expert, then your view might change slightly."

"169 Heavenly Spirit Realm experts?!" Lin Na’s eyes widened with shock. If he puts it that way, of course, that insignificant number will instantly turn massive!
