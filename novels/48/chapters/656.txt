Chapter 657 - Burning With Anger and Jealousy

"What was that about?" Su Yang asked Wu Jingjing sometime later.

"Haaa... Where should I begin?" Wu Jingjing sighed.

"Is this about that disciple who was with you at that time?" Su Yang asked.

"Disciple Zhang? No, he stopped bothering me ever since what happened at the Nine Spring Hall. This person is much more difficult to deal with, mostly because of his status..."

"Hoh? Who is this person that even one of the Ancient Academies cannot deal with?" Su Yang asked with his interest piqued.

"In the entire Holy Central Continent, there is only one power that surpasses the Holy Sword Academy and the Three Ancient Academies—"

"Let me guess, the Lian Family," Su Yang interrupted.

Wu Jingjing nodded her head and continued, "He’s the son of Emperor Lian— Lian Heng, and he’s also a disciple in the Holy Sword Academy— my father’s disciple."

"I understand what you mean by ’difficult to deal with’ now," Su Yang said with a calm expression on his face.

"Although Lian Heng is not the aggressive type, he’s incredibly persistent. He has a thing for me ever since he became a disciple here at the Holy Sword Academy, and he has been chasing after me since then." Wu Jingjing sighed, and she continued a moment later, "Hell, he’s still trying to court me now despite knowing that I already have a child with someone else."

"Though, he did stop bothering me for a year when he first found out that I was pregnant. However, he started returning shortly after Wu Min was born. I think he somehow knows that I am a single parent, hence why he’s still trying."

"Hmmm... This person is indeed quite persistent. You can’t help but admire people like him," Su Yang said. "There are not many men out there who would be willing to accept a woman who already has a baby with another man into their life. Of course, his behavior could also be explained as a fetish."

"F-Fetish? There are people with such fetishes?" Wu Jingjing looked at him with a terrified expression.

"Oh, you have no idea how many fetishes exist out there," Su Yang said with a weird smile on his face.

"Anyway, what does this Lian Heng guy have to do with those disciples?" he asked her.

"Well... As the son of the Lian Family, it is only natural that he has near limitless resources at hand, and because of his obsession with me, he has spies everywhere watching over me, hence why those disciples were asking personal questions, as they have to report to Lian Heng."

"It wasn’t too bad at first, but after I gave birth to Wu Min, he has essentially become a stalker who wants to know everything that happens in my life— probably because he wants to know the identity of Wu Min’s father," Wu Jingjing sighed.

"Your father can’t stop it?"

"He hasn’t tried, but that’s because we both know it will only be a waste of effort." Wu Jingjing shook her head with a bitter smile.

"But I don’t have to worry about him anymore since I have you here with me now," she said to him with a bright smile on her face.

"Of course. As long as I am here, I won’t let anyone harm you or our daughter no matter who they are, even if that person is the son of the emperor or even the emperor himself," Su Yang said, and he continued, "And since he will learn of my identity sooner or later, we might as well reveal our relationship ourselves."

"Okay." Wu Jingjing nodded her head.

She then embraced his entire arm until it was practically pressing against her b.r.e.a.s.ts. Now anyone who sees them will immediately know their intimate relationship with each other.

"L-L-L-Look over there!"

"Heavens! Is that Senior apprentice-sister Wu?!"

When the disciples noticed Wu Jingjing and Su Yang and saw the intimate atmosphere between them that was akin to a husband and wife going on a stroll with their child, the disciples stopped whatever they were doing to stare at them with gawking expressions on their faces.

"C-Could that young man be Senior apprentice-sister Wu’s partner!? Wu Min’s father?!"

"That must be him! I cannot imagine why else would Senior apprentice-sister act so intimately with him!"

"This is massive news! We need to report this to His Highness if someone hasn’t already!"

Wu Jingjing and Su Yang ignored the chaotic surroundings and the countless gazes that were staring at them and continued to walk down the sect with calm expressions on their faces, acting as though they were in their own little world.

Meanwhile, somewhere in the Holy Sword Academy, a handsome young man wore a cold expression on his face as another disciple kneeled before him.

"What you said just now... I want to hear it again," said the handsome young man.

"Yes, Your Highness!" The disciple spoke before repeating his words, "Senior apprentice-sister Wu’s partner has finally shown himself, and he’s currently strolling through the sect with Senior apprentice-sister Wu embracing his arms while holding her daughter in the other hand! If he’s not the person His Highness has been looking for, this subject will cut his own throat!"

"Take me to him!" Lian Heng spoke in a demanding voice.

"Yes, Your Highness!"

’So you have finally shown yourself! I don’t care who you are— I will make you regret stealing Wu Jingjing from me!’ Lian Heng could feel his heart burning with anger and jealousy just thinking about the years of effort he’d put into courting Wu Jingjing only to have another man steal her from him, even defiling her body by impregnating her.

A few seconds later, Lian Heng left his living quarters to follow the disciple.

Meanwhile, a few buildings away from Lian Heng’s living quarters, a woman with peerless facial features watched from her window as Lian Heng left his house with a murderous expression on his face. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

"What is that idiot up to now?" she mumbled in a curious voice.
