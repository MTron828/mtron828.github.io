Chapter 664 - Slightly Better Than Lian Heng

’What powerful Sword Intent...’

Even though it was only for a brief moment, Su Yang’s Sword Intent had caused Wu Jiang’s heart to skip a beat.

Furthermore, Wu Jiang was confident that Su Yang had not used his full power just now. If Su Yang were to use all of his Sword Intent, there was no doubt that Lian Heng would’ve died.

’Just how much more power is he hiding?’ Wu Jiang stared at Su Yang with a complicated frown on his face.

When Wu Jingjing noticed her father’s perplexed expression, she silently smiled to herself, ’If you think that was impressive, just wait until he uses ’that’ sword technique.’

Meanwhile, Lian Li suddenly jumped onto the stage, shocking everybody there.

"Her Highness just entered the stage! Does she plan on avenging her junior brother?!" The disciples watched with nearly uncontrollable excitement, as they rarely got to see Lian Li fight.

"Somebody get that disgraceful dog out of the stage!" Lian Li suddenly shouted in a commanding voice, and a sect elder immediately went to bring the unconscious Lian Heng off the stage.

Once they were alone on the stage, Lian Li retrieved a sword with a blue blade that emitted a chilling aura from her storage ring and pointed it at Su Yang before speaking, "Do you dare to accept my challenge?"

"Are you trying to avenge him?" Su Yang asked her with a calm expression on his face.

"Revenge? You are mistaken. I couldn’t care less even if you removed his limbs. However, you have openly challenged the Lian Family and even slapped our face before so many people, so I am going to punish you for that," she spoke with a cold expression on her fairy-like face.

"Is that so? But I don’t like hurting women— especially the beautiful ones without a damn good reason."

"What kind of excuse is that? Are you running away from me after barking so loudly not too long ago? If I recall correctly, you said that if I had a problem, I could step onto the stage, and that is exactly what I am doing, or are you going to go back on your words? Maybe you are actually a coward behind that facade filled with confidence!"

"..."

Su Yang narrowed his eyes at Lian Li and remained silent for a moment before nodding, "Very well, since you insist on fighting me, I will accept your challenge."

And then he continued, "However, since this is a challenge, there will be a loser and a winner, and in such cases, the loser usually has to sacrifice something."

Hearing his words, Lian Li quickly responded, "If you can defeat me in a sword battle, I will act as though everything that happened today never happened, and I will turn a blind eye to your disrespectful behavior towards the Lian Family just this time."

"However, if you lose this challenge, you will have to bear the full responsibility for disrespecting the Lian Family without uttering a single complaint no matter the punishment."

Su Yang nodded, "That sounds reasonable. However, to make this challenge more fun, why don’t we add a few more rules?"

"What are you thinking?" Lian Li frowned, feeling an ominous feeling about the smile that just appeared on Su Yang’s face.

"It’s quite simple, actually. Since I only dare to cut women who are my enemy, I will defeat you without harming a single hair on your body. If I injure your skin even a little with my sword or any sword techniques, it will automatically be my defeat."

"What...? Are you serious?" Lian Li looked at him with wide eyes. Does he actually plan on defeating her without hurting her? Is that even possible?

"Of course. And if I manage to achieve such a feat, in addition to your previous words, you’ll also have dinner with me tonight," Su Yang spoke with a handsome smile on his face.

"..."

"..."

"..."

The entire place turned silent after Su Yang’s last sentence, and every disciple at the arena was staring at Su Yang with disbelief on their faces.

"The audacity!" A loud voice boomed.

However, it was no Lian Li who spoke just now. Instead, such words came from Wu Jiang’s mouth.

"Are you f.u.c.k.i.n.g with me right now?! How dare you court another woman—Her Highness, no less— in front of Jingjing, who gave birth to your child?! Does the word ’fidelity’ not exist in your world?!" Wu Jiang shouted at Su Yang while pointing fingers.

"And you, Jingjing! Are you still going to defend him after seeing this?! This is the kind of man he really is!" Wu Jiang turned to look at her afterward.

"..."

Wu Jingjing was speechless. If her father is already this angry in this situation, one can only imagine his reaction once he learns about the identity of Zhu Jiayi’s father and all of Su Yang’s other women.

"There’s no point explaining it to you when you are this emotional, father," Wu Jingjing said to him before ignoring him again.

"You— I don’t care anymore!" Wu Jiang could feel his blood boiling from anger at this moment.

Meanwhile, Lian Li silently stared at Su Yang with a deep frown on her face. Despite her beauty, this is actually her first time being courted by a man due to her immense status, much less by a man that’s partially n.a.k.e.d who also dared to challenge and disrespect her family in public. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

"I don’t know what you’re thinking inside that messed up head of yours, but if you really think you can defeat me without harming me, there is clearly something wrong with you."

"You can think whatever you want about me, all I want to know is whether or not you agree to the additional rule," Su Yang said to her with a smile on his face.

"I agree! If you can really defeat me, much less accomplish that without harming me, I will be willing to do whatever you want me to!" Lian Li suddenly waved her sword with intense Sword Intent exuding from her aura, and there was even a hint of Sword Qi within her aura, causing the atmosphere there to change drastically.

"I guess you’re slightly better than your brother," Su Yang said with a calm expression on his face after seeing her Sword Intent.
