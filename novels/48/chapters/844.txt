Chapter 845 - Yellow River Sect

"Elder! We have a situation here! The Sect Master of the Profound Blossom Sect, Su Yang, is here, and he wants to meet with our Sect Master!" The guard relayed this information to the sect elder behind the jade slip.

"What? Is this true? Give me a moment to speak with the Sect Master."

A few minutes later, the guard at the entrance received the Sect Master’s permission to allow Su Yang inside the Yellow River Sect.

"Please give me a moment. I’ll call a disciple here to bring you to the Sect Master."

"Don’t bother. I know where to find him." Su Yang said as he went inside the sect.

Inside the Yellow River Sect, Su Yang’s presence attracted the attention of every disciple that saw him, and they all acted like they were seeing a ghost or something similar.

"Heavens! Isn’t that Su Yang from the Profound Blossom Sect? What’s he doing here? I thought he was still dealing with ’that’ event!"

"I guess it’s safe to assume that he’s finished. I wonder how many women he got to sleep with during that time."

"Definitely more than anybody in this sect will in their lifetime... combined."

News of Su Yang’s appearance quickly spread around the sect and the disciples, shocking everybody there.

Within minutes, female disciples from the sect could be seen outside their homes and trying to take a peek at Su Yang’s appearance.

"Wow, you got to sleep with someone that handsome? I kind of regret not going to that event now!"

"Yes, and it was a wonderful experience that I will remember for the rest of my life. Even my cultivation increased by four whole levels afterward!"

"Me too! I entered the True Spirit Realm in a single day thanks to Su Yang!"

"Aaaahh... I’m so envious! Why didn’t I meet the requirements?! I was only a level away from meeting the cultivation requirements, too!"

Meanwhile, somewhere within the Inner Court, Li Xiao Mo stopped walking when she heard the name ’Su Yang’ coming from the disciples beside her.

"Really? Does this mean he’s here right now?"

"That’s what I heard!"

Li Xiao Mo stared at these disciples with a somewhat dazed look on her face.

’Su Yang... He’s really here...’ Li Xiao Mo thought to herself.

At the Sect Master’s headquarters, Su Yang sat before an old man with a calm look on his face.

"Thank you for meeting with me despite my unannounced and sudden visit, Sect Master Huang." Su Yang said to the old man.

"Please, it’s an honor for the Yellow River Sect to have someone as exalted as you visit us. In fact, I’d like to apologize for not greeting you at the entrance."

Su Yang shook his head and said, "Let’s forget about the little talks and get straight to the point."

Sect Master Huang swallowed nervously after hearing Su Yang’s words, silently wondering to himself if the Yellow River Sect had done something to offend him.

Su Yang suddenly smiled and said, "Don’t worry, I’m not here to cause trouble."

He then retrieved a medium-sized wooden box and placed it on the table between them. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

"This is...?" Sect Master Huang raised his eyebrows.

"This is just a small token of gratitude I am giving the Yellow River Sect." Su Yang said, and he continued, "Go ahead. Open it."

Sect Master Huang swallowed nervously before he turned the box around and opened it in a careful manner, acting as if the box might explode if he didn’t.

"T-This is?!?!?" Sect Master Huang’s eyes widened with shock upon seeing the pills neatly placed inside the box.

Inside the box were three Heaven Transcendence Pill and seven Earth Advancement Pill.

"What is the meaning of this, Sect Master Su? What did the Yellow River Sect do to deserve your gratitude?" Sect Master Huang asked him. Surely, he didn’t come all the way here just to thank them because a few disciples from their sect had decided to give their bodies to him, right?

"Li Xiao Mo... Does this name sound familiar?" Su Yang suddenly brought up her name.

Su Yang nodded and said, "Then you should know that she used to be a disciple at the Profound Blossom Sect. When the other sects refused to help her, the Yellow River Sect accepted her as a disciple. As the Sect Master of the Profound Blossom Sect, I want to personally thank you for it."

"..."

Sect Master Huang remained silent, his thoughts unclear.

After a long moment of silence, Sect Master Huang spoke in a low voice, "You want Li Xiao Mo to return to the Profound Blossom Sect, huh? These pills... It’s definitely not just to thank us, right?"

"Indeed, I am here for Li Xiao Mo." Su Yang nodded his head, not even bothering to lie.

And he continued, "However, you’re wrong about one thing. Li Xiao Mo isn’t going to return to the Profound Blossom Sect as a disciple."

"Huh? What do you mean by that? Where are you going to take her then?" Sect Master Huang raised his eyebrows in a puzzled manner.

Su Yang extended a finger and pointed it at himself.

"I’m taking Li Xiao Mo with me to the Divine Heavens," he said with a smile on his face.

After another moment of silence, Sect Master Huang spoke again, "I understand the situation... However, I still don’t understand why you feel the need to speak with me, much less hand me these pills. If you want Li Xiao Mo to go with you, shouldn’t you be asking her instead?"

"Yes, but she’s hesitant because she doesn’t want to feel guilty about it. After all, the Yellow River Sect accepted her when nobody else did, and she feels some sort of obligation to stay in this place, hence why I’m here." Su Yang said in a calm voice.
