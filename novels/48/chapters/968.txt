Chapter 969 Is That Your Real Size?

"Can I pay extra to skip the line?" Feng Tianwei decided to ask, as she wasn’t willing to wait 3 weeks for a massage.

"Yes, there is a priority system. If you pay 15 medium-grade spirit stones, you get to skip the line for that day, but you will still have to wait until the end of the day when the store closes. However, all of the slots today are already full even for priority." Mei Xing said.

"Can I just pay for tomorrow’s priority?" Feng Tianwei asked the obvious.

Mei Xing shook her head and said, "Unfortunately, to keep things fair for everyone, we do not have a waitlist for priority. It’s a first come first serve basis."

"So I just have to be here early to get a slot, right?"

"Yes."

"I understand." Feng Tianwei nodded and left the store.

The day continued as normal until the massage parlor closed doors for normal customers.

Once Su Yang finished satisfying his priority customers, he said to Mei Xing, "You can go home now."

"I understand. I will see you tomorrow, Manager."

Su Yang smiled and said, "I think we’ll see each other again sooner than that."

"Eh? Are you visiting us again?" she asked him.

"Yes, I have to massage your mother for at least a couple more days before her body is fully recovered."

"I see... Thank you for your hard work, Manager."

Mei Xing then returned to the hotel first. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

However, as she left the massage parlor, she noticed someone standing outside the store.

"Excuse me, but we are already closed for today." Mei Xing recognized this pretty woman who wanted priority but was a little too slow.

"I know." Feng Tianwei said, and she continued, "This is for tomorrow."

"..."

Mei Xing silently admired this woman who was so dedicated for a priority slot.

She then left Feng Tianwei alone and returned to the hotel.

A few minutes later, Su Yang came outside the store and looked at Feng Tianwei.

"Hm? What are you doing here?" Su Yang acted surprised by her appearance there.

"I’m lining up for tomorrow," she said with a nonchalant look on her face.

"You know I can’t let a beautiful woman such as yourself stand there the entire night, right? I won’t be able to sleep peacefully knowing this. Come inside. I will give you special treatment just for today. You can consider it as my gratitude for giving me Mei Ying."

Feng Tianwei wasn’t humble and immediately accepted his offer.

Su Yang returned to the massage parlor with Feng Tianwei a moment later.

"Please lay down there for me." Su Yang pointed at the mattress in the center of the room.

Feng Tianwei stared at the mattress and spoke in a low voice, "Why are you working in such a shabby-looking place? With your skills and popularity, I’m sure that you will be able to find a much better place than this dump— excuse my language, but I just can’t comprehend your thoughts."

"If you need help finding a better place, I can help you." She then offered to help.

Su Yang smiled and said, "I appreciate your thoughts, but I am satisfied with this place. I can only accept so many customers a day, so even if I got a bigger building, it wouldn’t change the number of customers I accept every day. Furthermore, with the waitlist being a thing, this place is usually quite empty."

"Whatever. It’s your store, anyway."

Feng Tianwei then removed her clothes and laid on the mattress.

She immediately realized how comfortable this mattress was and said, "Hey, where did you buy this mattress? I want them for my brothel."

Su Yang chuckled and said, "They are custom made... by myself."

Feng Tianwei looked at him with wide eyes filled with disbelief.

"If you want a few mattresses, I can give you a couple, but it will take some time since I have to make them."

"How much do you want for each mattress?"

"It’s for free... technically."

"I don’t understand."

Su Yang then explained, "You don’t have to pay a single copper for the mattresses, but in return, you’ll do me a favor."

"What kind of favor?"

"It’s quite simple, really. I just want you to spread your experience here to a few of your friends."

"So basically, you want me to advertise your massage parlor for you?"

"Pretty much." Su Yang nodded.

"I don’t mind, but I won’t lie to them. If my experiences are not satisfactory, I will tell them as it is."

"That’s perfectly fine. I would never ask you to lie about your experiences at my massage parlor, either way."

"Then let’s begin."

Su Yang started pressing his fingers on her back shortly after.

However, not even a minute into the massage, Feng Tianwei said in an unhappy voice, "Hey, I was prepared to stand outside for an entire night. I will be very angry if all I got out of that is an ordinary massage."

Su Yang knew what she was implying, and he said, "Don’t worry, I know what you’re here for. There’s plenty of time, so there’s no need to rush things."

Feng Tianwei no longer said anything and allowed Su Yang to massage her back.

"Mmm..."

Despite her words just now, Feng Tianwei was actually very satisfied with the massage that stimulated the lust hidden within her body.

And in just five short minutes, Su Yang managed to make Feng Tianwei climax with just an ordinary back massage.

Seeing Feng Tianwei twitching on the mattress while her lower cave flowed with glistening Yin Qi, Su Yang stood up and started removing his clothes.

Feng Tianwei turned around to peek at his body, and her eyes immediately widened with shock when she saw the massage dragon between his legs.

"T-T-That is your real size? You didn’t enhance it with pills or something?" Feng Tianwei asked him in a trembling voice.

"Pills? Are you looking down on me? I will have you know that this is 100 percent authentic and real." Su Yang said while standing there with a prideful aura around him, leaving Feng Tianwei speechless.
