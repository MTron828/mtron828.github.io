Chapter 870 - Revisiting the Su Family

Author’s Note: I had the chapters arrange incorrectly, so the last chapter is actually this chapter. I have already fixed it, but if you read this chapter in the last chapter, please clear your cache in the setting and it should fix it.

"Y-Young Lady! Y-Young Master!"

The servants cleaning the outside were shocked when they saw Su Yin and Su Yang’s face there, even dropping their brooms.

Su Yin glanced at the servants without stopping her legs.

"When was the last time someone from the family called you Young Master, brother?" Su Yin asked him.

Su Yang merely shook his head with a smile on his face.

The servants and other family members in the Su Family would bow to Su Yin and Su Yang the moment they saw them, and not a single one of them would raise their heads until the two of them were completely gone from the scene.

"What are they doing here? I thought they had severed all relationsh.i.p.s with the Su Family?"

The servants began mumbling to each other after they left.

Inside the building, Su Yuhan, the only legitimate child of Su Xun left in the Su Family, stood before Su Xun and said in a desperate voice, "Father! There must be a treasure out there that could heal my state! Please! How else am I supposed to continue the family’s legacy when my body is like this?! It’s been months! I cannot continue to live like this!"

Su Xun sighed loudly before speaking, "Yuhan... What do you want me to do? I have already sent people to look for a treasure that can cure your condition, but they have yet to find anything like that. Hell, I even hired the best doctor available in the Eastern Continent to see if he could do something, but alas..."

And he continued, "Do you really think I don’t care about your condition? You’re the only one who can possibly continue the family legacy now that Su Yang and Su Yin are no longer part of the family."

"However, if you want to end yourself, go ahead! I can always look for a new wife and have more children!" Su Xun spoke with a solemn look on his face.

"..."

Su Yuhan no longer spoke after hearing his last sentence.

Suddenly, they could hear somebody knocking on the door.

"Who is it?! I am having a conversation with my father right now!" Su Yuhan shouted in an annoyed manner.

The door opened the next second.

"Who gave you the permission to come inside—"

Su Yuhan snapped his head around and yelled, but when he realized who was standing at the door, he immediately shut his mouth.

Furthermore, when he saw Su Yang’s face, he subconsciously closed his legs and covered his crotch area with his hands, and his nonexistent balls began to hurt like crazy.

"Ahhh!" Su Yuhan kneeled on the floor from this imaginary pain.

"It’s still not healed? I guess you really don’t care whether you have it or not." He then shrugged.

Su Yuhan almost coughed up a mouthful of blood after hearing Su Yang’s words.

"Y-You bastard! How dare you come back here after everything you’ve done! Thanks to you, I have been miserable ever since that day!" Su Yuhan roared.

Because Su Yang had crushed his balls, he had been bed-ridden for many months straight despite being a cultivator, not to mention the mental damage it’d caused him, which nearly put him into a coma.

"Su Yang, Su Yin, what are you two doing here?" Su Xun asked them with a surprised look on his face.

"We’re here to say goodbye, father." Su Yin said to him, completely ignoring Su Yuhan’s existence.

"Huh? What do you mean?" Su Xun raised his eyebrows.

"You have heard about Divine Heaven, right? I will be going to that place with brother soon. Therefore, we’re going to be leaving this world." Su Yin said.

"Divine Heaven? Oh, right... That other world..." Su Xun finally remembers hearing about Su Yang leaving this world to go to the Divine Heavens.

"Although I still cannot fully forgive you for what you did to brother, father, you are still my family in the end." Su Yin said.

"Also, I know you don’t want to find another wife because you don’t want to ’betray’ mother, but I think it’s about time you move on. After all, I highly doubt he’ll be able to continue the family’s legacy with his body in such a condition." Su Yin said to Su Xun while looking at Su Yuhan with disgust.

"S-Shut up, you brother-loving freak! As if you have any right to talk about continuing the legacy!" Su Yuhan said to her.

"Hmph. I will continue the legacy in my own way. At least I can still give birth to brother’s child and continue the legacy that way. What can you do with that destroyed junk? Might as well feed it to the pigs! At least it’ll have some uses then!" Su Yin coldly sneered.

Before his tragedy, Su Yuhan has always been the arrogant elder brother who would look down on everyone and treat them as though they were insects, even if they were his own family.

Perhaps if Su Yuhan hadn’t bullied the soulless Su Yang, she might not have hated him as much.

"Enough, you two." Su Xun shook his head.

"Su Yin, I have already told you everything I needed to when you decided to leave the family to follow Su Yang. I don’t have anything else to say... However, I do wish both of you good luck. The Su Family will survive just fine even without you two."

"As for you, Su Yang... Take care of your little sister. That’s all I have to say."

Su Yang smiled and said, "You may think I hold a grudge against you for kicking me out of the family, but I am actually grateful for it, as I was able to become the person I am today because of it."

He then retrieved a storage pouch and tossed it onto his desk.

"Take it."

Su Yang then turned to look at Su Yuhan and said, "I was going to help you heal that mess down there if you had changed even slightly, but alas... You haven’t changed even the slightest."

"W-What did you just say? You have a way to heal me?" Su Yuhan looked at him with wide eyes.

Su Yang shrugged and turned around, walking out of the room. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

"W-Wait!" Su Yuhan immediately shouted at him to stop, but Su Yang ignored him completely and continued to leave.
