Chapter 644 - Heavenly Spiritual Roots

Somewhere in the Holy Central Continent, a man wearing black armor kneeled before a middle-aged man wearing luxurious robes that resembled that of royalty.

"Your Majesty, we have spotted a flying ship approaching our continent, and it seems to be the one used by Immortal Fairy Su Yue." The man in black armor reported.

"Immortal Fairy Su Yue? It has been over a year since she last made her appearance." The middle-aged man spoke in a calm voice.

"What should we do?" The armored man asked before suggesting, "Should we greet her?"

"No, do not approach her. Immortal Fairy Su Yue does not like being approached by others— if she needs something, she will approach you. We will simply sit back and see what she’s going to do before we do anything. Maybe she’ll disappear soon like her previous visit."

"Yes, Your Majesty."

"What about the matter regarding Patriarch Gold? Do we have any news on his disappearance?" The middle-aged man then asked.

"We have spoken with a few people at the Golden Lion Academy, and they said that Patriarch Gold had left the continent. However, we are still unsure about his destination. He also took with him a few Heavenly Spirit Realm experts, so we can assume that he’s not traveling a short distance."

"Why on earth would Patriarch Gold leave the continent? And it’s been an entire year since his disappearance. How far did he travel? Is he even still alive? The Jade Sea is no joke even for someone as powerful as him." The middle-aged man sighed. The Golden Lion Academy has been moving at a steep decline ever since the incident that nearly destroyed the entire sect.

"This is only an assumption, but we believe that Patriarch Gold is traveling to one of the other four continents." The man in the black armor suddenly spoke.

"Are you certain about that? He should know that without my permission, nobody can travel to the other continents." ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

"Yes, Your Majesty."

"Let me know if Patriarch Gold appears again. I need to have a word with him." The middle-aged man said with a frown on his face.

Meanwhile, back at the flying ship, Su Yang said to the Xie Family, "We will arrive at the Holy Central Continent in about six hours."

"Six hours... I will finally get to see for myself ’Cultivator’s Paradise’ in six hours..." Lord Xie mumbled to himself with his body trembling from excitement.

However, Xie Wang merely continued to stare at the empty space with a dazed look on his face.

"I don’t want to ruin your mood but calling the Holy Central Continent ’Cultivator’s Paradise’ is an exaggeration. The only difference between the Holy Central Continent and the Eastern Continent is the overall level of its Cultivators. While the Eastern Continent lacks Cultivators at the Heavenly Spirit Realm, the Holy Central Continent has plenty of them, and that is only because they have a higher quality of Profound Qi."

"Anyway, we came here for the Four Element Roots, and I can only think of one place that might have this medicine— the Four Seasons Academy— the top medicine sect on the continent."

"The top sect...?" Lord Xie immediately frowned, and he asked a moment later, "How valuable is the Four Elements Root, anyway? I have brought some resources just in case we have to trade, but if it’s too expensive..."

"Well, it’s nothing special in my eyes, but in this world, where resources are scarce, I can imagine it being quite valuable," Su Yang said.

Seeing the worried expression on his face, Su Yang continued, "Don’t worry, even if they don’t have the Four Elements Root, there are plenty of other resources that can be used as a substitute at the cost of lowering the pill’s effect."

Six hours later, they can finally see land and trees in the distance.

"The Holy Central Continent!" Lord Xie stared at the place with wide eyes, looking as though he was trying to crave the scenery into his soul so that he’ll never forget.

"So this place really existed..." Even Xie Wang regained some of his energy and spirit after seeing the legendary land for the first time.

"The Profound Qi in this place is simply astonishing..." Xie Xingfang spoke in a surprised voice. "I can feel my Cultivation improving just by breathing it."

"It’s no wonder why there are so many Heavenly Spirit Realm experts in this place. If I got to cultivate this quality of Profound Qi every day, I would’ve long entered the Sovereign Spirit Realm." Xie Wang sighed loudly.

"There’s something I don’t understand, Su Yang. The Holy Central Continent and the Eastern Continent both exist in the same world, yet why is there such a vast difference in the quality of our Profound Qi?" Xie Xingfang suddenly asked him.

Lord Xie and Xie Wang also turned to look at him after hearing Xie Xingfang’s question, as they have never thought about this themselves.

"Good question." Su Yang nodded before continuing, "Think of it like this— just because you live in the same house as someone doesn’t necessarily mean your rooms will look exactly the same with the same atmosphere, and it’s mostly the furniture and decorations that make the difference. In this case, the furniture is the natural resources that exist in each continent."

"In simpler terms, the reason why the Holy Central Continent has a higher quality of Profound Qi than the Eastern Continent is simply that they have more natural treasures than us. Not only that, below the Holy Central Continent exists something called Heavenly Spiritual Roots that enhances their Profound Qi."

"Heavenly Spiritual Roots also exist below the Eastern Continent, but it’s not as strong as the ones here, hence the difference between our spiritual energy."

"Heavenly Spiritual Roots...? Heaven, this is my first time hearing this term!" Lord Xie exclaimed.

"If that’s the case, what happens if the Heavenly Spiritual Roots are damaged or destroyed?" Xie Wang suddenly asked him.

"Then the Profound Qi in that area will immediately decline in quality and quantity. In your case, it would be the entire Eastern Continent," he calmly responded.
