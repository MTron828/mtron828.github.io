Chapter 646 - Legendary Pill Recipe

"Sect Master Zhu! This is an emergency! We have four visitors, three Heavenly Spirit Realm experts, and one Sovereign Spirit Realm master! However, we don’t recognize any of them!" The messenger rushed to the Sect Master’s building to notify her of Su Yang’s arrival.

"What? How can you not recognize someone at the Sovereign Spirit Realm? There are only a handful of experts at the Sovereign Spirit Realm, and you mean to tell me that you don’t recognize this person!?" Sect Master Zhu quickly lectured this disciple.

"Sect Master, I know the face of every Cultivator at the Sovereign Spirit Realm, but I really don’t recognize this one! It’s an old man at the first level Sovereign Spirit Realm!"

"An old man at the first level Sovereign Spirit Realm?" Sect Master Zhu raised her eyebrows upon hearing this information, as she also doesn’t recall any old man at that level.

"Did you ask for their names?" she then asked.

"Yes, three of them belong to a family with the surname ’Xie’, and the last one was named Su Yang." The disciple said.

"Surnamed Xie and Su— Huh?" The Sect Master instantly stopped talking, and she stared at the disciple with wide eyes and a gawking expression, looking as though she just witnessed the impossible.

"W-W-W-What was the name of that last person? R-Repeat it for me again," she spoke in a stuttering voice, not daring to believe her ears.

"Umm... I believe he called himself ’Su Yang’..." The disciple responded with a nervous look after seeing the Sect Master’s reaction.

And suddenly—

Bang!

The disciple watched in horror when Sect Master Zhu stood up and flew out of the closed window, creating an ugly hole in the wall.

"Sect Master?!" The disciple immediately rushed to the window and called out to her, but alas, she was long gone.

Meanwhile, at the Four Seasons Academy’s entrance, Su Yang and the Xie Family casually waited outside while one of the disciples went to notify Sect Master Zhu of his arrival.

"Don’t you know them, Su Yang? Why do we have to wait like this if you knew them?" Lord Xie asked him.

"Hm? I only know a few individuals from this place," he casually responded.

"..." Lord Xie was beginning to worry if the Four Seasons Academy would even listen to their request, much less give them the Four Elements Root.

Just as Lord Xie began worrying, they could feel a powerful aura approaching their location at immense speed.

"What a strong aura! This expert must be at the Sovereign Spirit Realm!" Lord Xie expressed surprise.

"This is my second time seeing another individual who’s at the Sovereign Spirit Realm! And this person’s aura feels even stronger than that bastard!" Xie Wang was greatly surprised that he would meet someone stronger than Patriarch Gold so quickly.

"T-That is the Sect Master! The Sect Master is approaching us!" The disciples stationed at the gate immediately lined up in an orderly fashion and patiently waited for Sect Master Zhu’s arrival.

A few moments later, they bowed to the figure that descended before them, "Greetings, Sect Master Zhu!"

However, Sect Master Zhu ignored them and immediately approached Su Yang.

"Oh my... Oh my goodness! It’s really you, Su Yang!" Sect Master Zhu grabbed his shoulders with trembling hands and teary eyes.

"Are you okay...?" Su Yang was baffled by her reaction, who looked like she was meeting her long lost son for the first time in years.

"I’m fine— perfectly fine! It’s just that I never thought I’d ever see you again after your departure!" she said after wiping her tears.

"Anyway, what brings you back to this place? Are you perhaps here to see Zhu Mingyi?" she looked at him with a hopeful gaze.

He nodded and said, "Yes, along with a few other matters."

"Please! Let’s talk elsewhere— somewhere more comfortable!"

Sect Master Zhu then led Su Yang and the Xie Family away, leaving the disciples dumbfounded.

"Who the hell was that young man?! I have never seen the Sect Master acting like that before! She reminded me of my grandmother just now!" ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

"She even cried! I don’t think I will be able to sleep tonight after seeing that!"

Meanwhile, back at the Sect Master building, after everyone sat down, Sect Master Zhu spoke, "Please ignore the broken window, it was an accident."

She then looked at Su Yang and continued, "Zhu Mengyi is currently at the Holy Sword Sect. However, I have already sent her a message regarding your presence, so she should return soon."

"Anyway, what other matters do you have?"

Su Yang then said, "Do you know of a treasure called ’Four Elements Root’? I am looking for it."

"Four Elements Root?" Sect Master Zhu immediately raised her eyebrows in surprise. "Of course, I know of this treasure. In fact, pretty much every Alchemist that exists on this continent is aware of this divine treasure that is rumored to be one of the ingredients for a legendary pill recipe that is said to have the capabilities to revive the dead."

"However, it’s an exceeding rare treasure that is governed by the Emperor himself, so only a few individuals have ever got to see it, much less touch it."

"A legendary pill recipe for reviving the dead? As if something like that exists." Su Yang shook his head, instantly announcing this pill as pure nonsense. While there are many similar legends in the Four Divine Heavens, nobody has ever concocted a pill that can revive the dead— not even the Alchemy God who is known to have the ability to concoct every pill that exists in the universe.

"Regardless of the rumors’ authenticity, it is a fact that the Four Elements Root is not something one can easily get their hands on, and if you are looking for it, I can only refer you to the Emperor himself," Sect Master Zhu said to him in a regrettable voice.

"Who is this Emperor? Tell me more about him," Su Yang then said.

Sect Master Zhu nodded her head, and she proceeded to explain everything to him.
