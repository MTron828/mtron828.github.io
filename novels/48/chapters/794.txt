Chapter 795 - A Total of 27 Immortal-grade Cultivation Techniques

"I-I understand. However, just like the Root of Revival, this is not a matter that I can decide alone." Cang Shicai said, and then he turned around to look at the nine figures behind him, "Fortunately for us today, the Nine Immortal Families are here."

And he continued, "What do you think, Seniors? Are you willing to accept this condition?"

Standing behind Cang Shicai were 9 old men with profound auras, and they were all high-ranking individuals within their respective families with enough authority to make such decisions without the head of their family.

However, before they could even open their mouths to speak, Su Yang said with a smile on his face, "If I cannot defeat every participant in this tournament by myself, I will give every family three Immortal-grade cultivation techniques, and they all will be different from each other. On the other hand, if I defeat everyone and win, I shall only take the Root of Revival. What do you think?"

The nine elders looked at each other with dumbfounded looks on their faces, as what Su Yang said sounded too good to be true.

If what Su Yang said is true, does this mean he’ll be giving out a total of 27 Immortal-grade cultivation techniques? How can a single individual have so many of them when even the most influential families in this world have at most one or two Immortal-grade cultivation techniques.

"I can see the doubt in your eyes, but I’ll personally reassure you that he’ll keep his words," Xian Ni suddenly said, dumbfounding the elders even more.

"If not, the Xian Family will take full responsibility and give each of your family treasures worth around three Immortal-grade cultivation techniques."

After talking with each other in the background for a couple of minutes, the nine elders returned to their side and nodded with smiles on their faces.

"Very well! We’ll accept this change! If this young man here can defeat every participant in this tournament by himself, we’ll give him every reward on the list, let alone the Root of Revival. However, if he cannot, then he’ll have to hand each family 3 unique Immortal-grade cultivation techniques."

Su Yang nodded and said, "Yes."

"Then we’ll go ahead and prepare for this."

Cang Shicai and the nine elders then left the area to do their own things. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

"What do you think? You may have the memories of an Immortal, but your real cultivation is only at the peak Heavenly Spirit Realm. Even if you have a tough body, it’ll be difficult to fight so many experts at once." Xian Ni said to him.

"You don’t think I’ll be able to defeat them?" Su Yang looked at him with a mysterious smile.

"No, I trust that you’ll be able to do it. I am just unsure how easily you’ll be able to achieve this since I don’t know your real abilities." Xian Ni said with a pondering look on his face.

Su Yang smiled and said, "Let’s just say... If I’d used my cultivation during our spar, you wouldn’t have stood a chance."

Xian Ni looked at him with wide eyes. A Heavenly Spirit Realm Cultivator defeating someone in the Sovereign Spirit Realm? Unless he witnesses it with his own eyes, it was almost impossible for him to witness.

Of course, he’d been beaten by Su Yang already, but they weren’t using their cultivation at that time.

Meanwhile, the nine elders from the Nine Immortal Families return to their own families to spread the news and changes regarding the tournament, shocking everybody there, especially the participants.

"What the heck?! We’re going to have to fight someone at the peak Heavenly Spirit Realm?! That’s impossible!" One of the participants who were only at the True Spirit Realm exclaimed.

"Don’t worry, as long as even a single person defeats him, it’ll be our victory, and we’ll obtain three Immortal-grade cultivation techniques. This is not a battle of strength but a battle of endurance!"

"Hmmm... Three Immortal-grade cultivation techniques... This is indeed a tempting offer that’s extremely hard to refuse. I understand why you agreed, elder..."

Even though the Patriarchs of these nine Immortal Families were skeptical and even slightly angry at first that their precious tournament was changed by a single individual, they also wanted these three Immortal-grade cultivation techniques.

"Since Ancestor Xian himself has given us reassurance, I guess we can trust this unknown individual."

Sometime later, all nine Patriarches from the nine Immortal Families appeared before the millions of spectators to announce the changes for the tournament.

"Thank you all for being patient. However, there have been changes to the tournament, and this will be an unprecedented event!"

"Instead of ten thousand participants fighting each other, these ten thousand participants will have to try and defeat a single individual who is at the peak Heavenly Spirit Realm!"

"Of course this peak Heavenly Spirit Realm Cultivator has met the requirements to participate in this tournament. However, it wouldn’t be fun or fair if someone at that level enters this tournament, and this change was suggested by the individual himself!"

"Furthermore, this tournament has been blessed by Ancestor Xian himself!"

The audience was puzzled at first, then they were shocked by the changes, finally exploding with excitement when they heard the name ’Ancestor Xian’.

Sometime later, the Patriarchs said, "Now, let’s give a grand welcoming to Ancestor Xian!"

The next moment, a dominating aura appeared in the place, and Xian Ni descended from the heavens like an Immortal and hovered in the middle of the coliseum with a grand presence.

When the audience noticed Xian Ni’s presence, every individual there stood up and bowed to him. As for those that had enough room to kowtow, they went to their knees and kowtowed to him.

However, Xian Ni didn’t even bother to introduce himself and said, "I am only here today to support my new friend who came from the Eastern Continent."

A few seconds later, a handsome young man with otherworldly features appeared and calmly walked onto the grand stage before standing in the middle with a confident smile on his face.
