Chapter 783 Collection Room

"If that’s your choice, I won’t say anything else. Bring the Flower of Resurrection here so we can finish this deal," Su Yang said.

However, Ji Hong did not immediately leave and said instead, "D-Do you think I will be able to buy the other treasures? Even if it’s just one or two of them, I’d love to add them to my collection! Please! I beg of you!"

Seeing Ji Hong begging him, Su Yang said, "Just like you, I have no interest in money. However, if you have some treasures that I want, I can consider exchanging my treasures for them."

"Oh, thank you! Thank you very much! Please, follow me to the collection room! The Flower of Resurrection is there, too!"

Su Yang nodded and proceeded to follow Ji Hong into another room that was on the other side of the house.

Sometime later, they stood before a giant door that emitted an ominous feeling.

Su Yang frowned slightly when he saw this, and he said, "What is inside this room? Why do I sense a cursed presence coming from within?"

"What do you mean by that, Senior? Cursed presence?" Ji Hong looked at him with a genuinely confused look on his face, clearly having no clue what Su Yang was talking about.

"Cursed presence? I also don’t feel anything," Lian Li also said.

"It’s not unrealistic that you can’t sense it because I am currently using a unique technique that allows me to see things one normally is unable to see," said Su Yang, who had the All-Seeing Celestial Eyes activated, which allowed him to see the cursed presence.

"Li’er, it’d be for the best if you stay out here just in case. The cursed presence is pretty intense but it won’t be able to harm us because of our cultivation base. However, it might be a different case for the vulnerable little one inside your body right now." Su Yang said to her.

Lian Li nodded, "Okay, I’ll stay out here until you’re done." Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

"I’m really sorry about this, Seniors... I collect treasures from all around the world, and most of them I don’t have any information on, so I might have picked up a cursed treasure or something, but it was definitely not intentionally..." Ji Hong immediately began apologizing.

Su Yang shook his head and said, "Don’t worry about it, I am not blaming you. Cursed treasures are incredibly rare, and not many people know how to spot them even where I am from so I definitely don’t expect people here to know about their existence."

"Thank you, Senior! And once again, I apologize for all of this..." Ji Hong nodded.

A few moments later, Ji Hong took a minute to deactivate the formation that was protecting the collection room before opening the door.

"Thank you for waiting, esteemed guest." Ji Hong said to him afterward.

Su Yang narrowed his eyes slightly at the cursed presence that was oozing out of the open door. However, no matter how intimidating it may appear, Su Yang has experienced cursed presences that were many times more powerful.

Thus, he entered the collection room with Ji Hong with a calm look on his face.

The instant Su Yang entered the collection room, he could feel the temperature in the room drop sharply, feeling almost like he’d been transported into a snowy area with cold breezes.

The collection room itself was quite vast with many display cases properly placed inside, looking like an expensive jewelry store. But instead of jewelry, there were rare treasures being displayed.

"Feel free to look around, esteemed guest. If you see something that you like or are interested in, please let me know. The Flower of Resurrection is towards the end of the room."

Su Yang nodded and proceeded to look through the treasures in the room while ignoring the cursed presence that quickly surrounded him, almost like it was trying to analyze his existence.

’Hmmm, although these are definitely top-grade treasures in this world, I don’t need any of them...’ Su Yang thought to himself until he noticed a glowing red jewel sitting calmly in the middle of the room.

’This is...’

Su Yang narrowed his eyes at this red jewel that appeared to have some sort of liquid trapped in the center.

Ji Hong could tell that Su Yang was interested in the red jewel and said to him, "That’s one of many treasures that I have no information on, and it was sold to me by some Cultivator who said he’d found it near a volcano that’d recently erupted. There appears to be some kind of liquid inside the jewel, but I do not dare to crack it open so I left it untouched."

Su Yang then said, "The liquid inside is the real treasure, as it’s basically Yang Element spiritual energy that’d liquefy. This is perfect for someone like me. I’ll exchange this jewel for one of my treasures, and once again, I’ll let you decide."

"Thank you, esteemed guest! I will take it out for you now!"

Ji Hong quickly opened the display case and retrieved the red jewel from inside before handing it to Su Yang.

Su Yang in return allowed Ji Hong to pick one of his treasures.

Once the transaction was completed, Su Yang continued to look around for more treasure.

After a couple more minutes, Su Yang stopped walking again and stood in front of another display case.

"So this is the cursed treasure, huh? Its appearance doesn’t match its powerful presence," Su Yang shook his head at the wooden sword in the display case.

"How’d you know this was a treasure?" Su Yang turned to ask Ji Hong a moment later.

"Oh, that? I thought it was only an ordinary wooden stick at first, but when the person who sold me this weapon tried to destroy it but failed, I knew it was a treasure." Ji Hong said, and he continued, "The person who sold me that treasure was a Cultivator at the peak of the Heavenly Spirit Realm, but he was unable to make a dent on this wooden sword with a Heaven-grade treasure."
