Once they entered the house, Wang Shuren said, "You really are one dangerous man, huh."

Su Yang smiled.

"Is that all you came here to say?"

"Would you be happier if I said that I was worried about you after hearing about what happened here?"

"What did you hear from? Asides from the disciples leaving, almost nothing notable happened."

Wang Shuren turned silent for a moment before asking, "This mysterious expert that helped the Profound Blossom Sect... are you related to him?"

"What makes you think that?"

"If you had a mentor from the Holy Central Continent, it would slightly make sense why you are so experienced despite your young age... probably."

"Is that what my Sect Master said? That he’s from the Holy Central Continent?"

Although he did not expect his disguise to be affiliated with the Holy Central Continent, he was not surprised that Liu Lanzhi came to such a conclusion.

"Is she wrong?" Wang Shuren raised an eyebrow.

Su Yang shrugged and said, "I wouldn’t know, as I have no relationships with him."

Wang Shuren stared at him with suspicious eyes.

After a moment of silence, Su Yang spoke, "Is there anything you’d like to say before I return to my cultivation? The Regional Tournament is only a few months away so I cannot afford to relax."

Su Yang spoke in a tone that was as though he would be suffering during the Regional Tournament if he did not cultivate.

"What? The Profound Blossom Sect will be participating in the Regional Tournament?"

Wang Shuren expressed surprised.

"Of course. Why wouldn’t we?"

"Does the Profound Blossom Sect even have enough disciples to participate? If I recall correctly, you need at least 10 that qualifies for the event."

"We do."

"..."

Wang Shuren stared at Su Yang for a few moments before asking, "And by cultivate, do you mean playing with those young girls out there?"

Her voice sounded somewhat stiff, almost like she disapproved of such methods.

Su Yang smiled and said calmly, "The Profound Blossom Sect is simply that sort of place."

"How shameless..."

"Shouldn’t you have known this since we first met? You instantly recognized me as a disciple from the Profound Blossom Sect, after all."

"Well, that’s true... but..."

Wang Shuren became quiet, and after a moment, she asked, "How long... How long does it usually take?"

"How long does what take?" Su Yang pretended to be oblivious to her question.

"You know! Cultivation!"

"Hmm? Are you interested?"

Wang Shuren’s face noticeably reddened.

"Well, each session differs depending on my partner. That being said, most people here cannot even last half an hour."

Su Yang shook his head. However, what lacked in quality was filled with quantity. Although his sessions with the disciples are short, there is usually someone already outside and waiting for him.

"Are you bragging?" Wang Shuren looked at him with a weird expression.

"I am merely speaking facts. If you want, I can show you," he said with a smile.

"Are you seriously asking me such a thing? If you didn’t know, I am still pure." Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

"Really? Even though you are always wearing such enchanting outfits? I did not expect that you’d still be a maiden!"

Su Yang acted surprised, almost like he couldn’t believe it.

"Are you mocking me?" Wang Shuren frowned. "Just because I want to be appealing to the eyes of others does not mean I am trying to ensnare them!"

"I was merely praising your charm as a woman."

Su Yang sighed.

"Oh... is that so?"

Wang Shuren immediately blushed. She didn’t think Su Yang would compliment her in such a fashion — especially when he is usually nonchalant towards her, almost like he doesn’t even see her as a woman; it was an odd feeling for her.

After a moment of silence, Wang Shuren took a deep breath before speaking, "Su Yang, do you recall what you said to me before you left the Burning Lotus Sect?"

Su Yang raised an eyebrow in puzzlement. Did he say something to her? He can’t recall for some odd reason.

Wang Shuren tightly gripped both of her hands, and she continued, "That you’d punish me if I slacked in my training? Well... to tell you the truth, I have been slacking... very much..."

Su Yang stared at her with wide eyes. He didn’t know whether to laugh or cry at this moment, as he’d never expected this situation.

"Hahahaha!" Su Yang suddenly burst out laughing, as he could no longer contain his laughter.

Wang Shuren’s face immediately flushed red, just like her robes that resembled burning flames. Of course, she has been training diligently every day and what she said was a lie. However, she wanted to use this chance to take their relationship to another step, something she has been thinking about ever since Su Yang’s appearance at the Burning Lotus Sect, and she figured that this would be the most effective way to express her current desires.

And as bizarre as Wang Shuren’s method may seem, it was definitely effective in getting her intent across to Su Yang.

"Stop laughing and say something already, Su Yang! I will leave right now if you don’t!"

Wang Shuren felt like bolting out the door at this moment due to embarrassment.

Su Yang wiped the tears from his eyes and said, "You want me to punish you, huh? Very well..."

He then stood up and approached her.

"What kind of punishment do you think one should deserve in such a situation?" he asked her.

"I-I don’t know—"

Su Yang suddenly moved his head forward and touched Wang Shuren’s lips with his own just as she opened her mouth to speak.

After giving her a gentle kiss, Su Yang stepped back and spoke with a handsome smile on his face, "Something like that?"

Wang Shuren did not respond even after many seconds, as she was completely dazed by Su Yang’s action just now.

"Or was that too light of a punishment? Maybe I should do something horrible to you — something that cannot be reverted. What do you think?" he asked her again, his hands gently caressing her smooth face.

Wang Shuren’s body trembled at his touch.

"Whatever you decide to do... I deserve it..." Wang Shuren said after forcefully swallowing her saliva.

Su Yang nodded and began reaching for her robes.
