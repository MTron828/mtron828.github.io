Chapter 655 - Heading to the Holy Sword Academy

"Your Majesty, Sect Master Zhu has sent us a message."

A guard kneeled before the handsome middle-aged man with a scroll resting on his palms.

"Sect Master Zhu? Let me see." Emperor Lian accepted the scroll and began reading the message.

"The Xie Family... Su Yang... from the Eastern Continent? Interesting..." Emperor Lian rubbed his chin with a profound gaze.

"If I recall correctly, Su Yang is the name of Immortal Fairy Su Yue’s husband. If this Su Yang is the same individual, I would very much like to meet him," Emperor Lian nodded his head.

"Let Sect Master Zhu know that I am willing to meet with these guests and that it will happen in two days."

"As Your Majesty commands!"

The guard nodded before leaving the room.

"These guests from the Eastern Continent... They must have crossed the Jade Sea with Immortal Fairy Su Yue’s assistance. Since that’s the case, I cannot ignore them." Emperor Lian recalled the flying ship that approached their Holy Central Continent not long ago.

Meanwhile, after receiving Emperor Lian’s response from a communication talisman, Sect Master Zhu immediately went to share the news with Su Yang.

"Great news, Su Yang! I have received a response from Emperor Lian just now, and he agreed to meet with you in two days!" Sect Master Zhu said to him after going to their house.

"Two days, huh?" Su Yang nodded.

"Oh, one more thing. I didn’t mention the Four Elements Root to Emperor Lian because he might not have agreed with the meeting if he knew you were only there for the treasure, so you’ll have to tell him yourself."

"That’s fine. Thank you," Su Yang said.

"Then I’ll go speak with the Xie Family now," Sect Master Zhu said.

"Wait for a second, mother! Before you go, I want you to know that I have something very important to tell you later," Zhu Mengyi said to her.

"Something very important?" Sect Master Zhu raised her eyebrows in a suspicious manner before nodding, "I understand. You can come to my room whenever you are ready."

Sect Master Zhu left shortly later to let the Xie Family know about the meeting in two days.

Meanwhile, Zhu Mengyi said to Su Yang, "Su Yang, I am going to tell my mother that I will be leaving with you in the future."

"Do you want me to come with you?" he asked.

"No, I can handle this by myself. You should take this time and visit the Holy Sword Academy with Jingjing before meeting with Emperor Lian," Zhu Mengyi said to him.

Su Yang nodded and said Wu Jingjing, "Before we head to the Holy Sword Academy, I should let the Xie Family know so they are aware of my absence."

"Okay, we’ll be waiting here for you," Wu Jingjing said.

Sometime later, Su Yang went to the Xie Family’s living quarters.

"Su Yang? Do you need anything? Senior Zhu just left this place after telling us about the meeting in two days if that’s what you’re going to tell us," Xie Wang said after opening the door.

"I know, she told me before coming here. I am here to let you know that I will be away from this place briefly to visit the Holy Sword Academy, one of the Three Ancient Academies."

"Will you return in time for the meeting?" Xie Wang asked him.

"Of course," said Su Yang.

"Okay, I will let the other two know."

Su Yang returned to Wu Jingjing’s side shortly later.

"Are we ready to leave?" Su Yang asked her after returning.

"Yes, we can leave whenever."

"Then hop on."

Su Yang retrieved the small flying boat before boarding it, and Wu Jingjing followed him with Wu Min in her arms.

"Where is the Holy Sword Academy?" Su Yang asked her once they were in the air.

"200,000 miles north," she said.

"200,000 miles? How did the two of you return to the Four Seasons Academy so fast?" Su Yang raised his eyebrows.

"Oh... We couldn’t wait to meet you again after receiving Senior Zhu’s message, so Zhu Mengyi used a life-saving treasure to teleport us back here..." Wu Jingjing explained with a bashful expression.

"You wasted a life-saving treasure just to come back faster? I don’t even know whether I should laugh or cry at this..." Su Yang said while shaking his head.

"Anyways, sit tight— this flying boat is quite fast, and we’ll reach the Holy Sword Academy in about fifteen minutes."

"That fast!?" Wu Jingjing’s eyes widened.

"I can hold onto the baby if you’re not confident," Su Yang said with a smile.

"P-Please do..." Wu Jingjing quickly handed Wu Min to him before they began moving.

Once Su Yang and Wu Jingjing left the sect, Zhu Mengyi made her way to her mother’s room.

"You’re here already? What did you want to speak to me about?" Sect Master Zhu said after seeing her face.

"I just want to let you know that Su Yang has decided to take responsibility for our children and accepted me and Wu Jingjing into his family," she wasted no time telling her mother the truth.

"What!? Is that true?!" Sect Master Zhu immediately stood up from shock and on her face was an ecstatic expression.

"Yes, I have even accepted his Family Seal." Zhu Mengyi lifted her robes to show her mother the Family Seal below her belly button. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

"W-What is that?" Sect Master Zhu asked her, as this is also her first time seeing such a thing.

"This is proof that Su Yang has accepted me into his family— the Su Family." Zhu Mengyi said.

"And because I have decided to join his family with Wu Jingjing, I will be leaving the sect to go with him in the future."

"W-W-Wait a second! You’re going to leave the sect? This is too sudden!"

"I know, but this is something that I have already decided, as I don’t want to separate from him again, and our daughter needs a father," she said to her.
