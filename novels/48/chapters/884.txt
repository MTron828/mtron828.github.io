Chapter 885 - Some Things Never Change

"I will definitely keep that in mind." Su Yang said after hearing Cheng Xiaochen’s offer.

Sometime later, Cheng Xiaochen left with Elder Mu and the other disciples.

Once they left the place, Su Yang sighed, "It was really nice seeing you again, Cheng Xiaochen."

Even though he knew that he had returned to the Four Divine Heavens, it still felt somewhat surreal to him. However, after seeing Cheng Xiaochen, an old friend, Su Yang felt more relieved, as her existence confirmed that he had indeed made it back home.

Su Yang and Xiao Rong continued to sit around for another day until their time at the bazaar were up, but alas, Xiao Rong’s Yin Qi remained unsold, as it was too precious and rare.

’Even though we couldn’t sell her Yin Qi, at least we have enough funds to use the teleport now.’ Su Yang thought to himself.

Sometime later, Su Yang returned to the Registration Hall to hand in their medallion.

"Thank you. If you don’t mind, can you share with us what you’ve managed to sell and how much you earned? This is only for statistical purposes. You don’t have to tell us if you don’t want to," said the receptionist.

"I don’t mind. I sold 70 bottles of Yang Qi for 70 high-grade spirit stones." Su Yang said to her.

"Y-Yang Qi?" The receptionist raised her eyebrows.

Although it’s not the weirdest thing sold before in their place, it was definitely shocking how much he earned from it.

"Thank you for the information. If you ever wish to return, our Stellar Bazaar will always be open for you." The receptionist said to him.

Su Yang and Xiao Rong left the building and then the city shortly after.

Once they were outside, Su Yang took Xiao Rong into the air with the flying treasure and began making their way to the Red Win City for their teleport formation.

However, a few minutes into their journey, Xiao Rong’s eyebrows twitched when she noticed a presence following them from a distance.

"Master, we’re being followed," she said to him.

"Interesting... Who is it?" He asked.

"It’s that man who asked about the Yin Qi," she said. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

"That Divine Origin Realm middle-aged man, huh? Just pretend you don’t notice him. If he does anything funny, kill him, but don’t make a scene when you’re doing it." Su Yang said to her.

Xiao Rong nodded.

Thus, they continued their journey whilst ignoring the man who was following them.

A few hours later, the middle-aged man suddenly decided to stop hiding and appeared before them.

"Hm? Did you change your mind and decide to buy the Yin Qi in the end?" Su Yang asked him, acting ignorantly.

The middle-aged man laughed at Su Yang’s words before speaking in a cold voice, "Yes, I have changed my mind. I will be taking those Yin Qi off your hands now. However, I won’t be paying you for them."

Su Yang acted surprised and said, "What? They’re not for free! If you want them, you’ll have to pay for them! 1,000 high-grade spirit stones each!"

"One thousand? You said it was only for 100 high-grade spirit stones!" The middle-aged man quickly said.

"Hmm? Did I say that? Sorry, I forgot." Su Yang shrugged, and he continued, "I have bad memories, after all."

"Enough yapping! Hurry up and give me those bottles unless you want a painful death!" The middle-aged man shouted at him.

However, Su Yang remained calm and said, "You don’t seem like a dual cultivator. Why do you need my Yin Qi?"

"Hmph! Since you’re going to die anyway, I don’t mind telling you. I need them because—"

The middle-aged man suddenly stopped midway through his speech and disappeared from his spot, appearing in front of Su Yang with a sword in his grasp and ready to separate Su Yang’s head from his body.

"Die for me, you damn pig!"

However, before the middle-aged man’s sword could travel an inch, Xiao Rong’s eyes flickered with killing intent.

*Cough!*

The middle-aged man suddenly stopped moving and coughed up a mouthful of blood, his face with a look of disbelief.

It happened in an instant, but the middle-aged man felt his heart being crushed by an invisible force before he died.

"Haaa..." Su Yang sighed in a calm manner, "The moment I saw your greedy eyes back at the bazaar, I knew you would do something stupid. Even though 2,000 years have passed, there are things that will never change, and that is human nature."

After the middle-aged man’s lifeless body landed on the ground, Su Yang went down and searched his corpse, retrieving whatever valuables he had on his body.

"Just ten high-grade spirit stones and a Heaven-grade sword? You’re more broke than I’d anticipated." Su Yang shook his head, taking only the spirit stones and the sword before leaving everything else behind.

The beasts in the area will eventually find the man’s corpse and eat it, so there was no need for him to do anything about it.

Su Yang returned to the flying boat and continued their journey shortly after.

"Here you go, Xiao Rong. I saved a few just for you." Su Yang said as he retrieved a bottle of his Yang Qi that had supposedly been sold out.

"Thank you, Master!" Xiao Rong accepted the bottle and immediately began drinking the contents.

And even though she drank it as slow as she could, the bottle became empty moments later.

A few days later, they arrived at the Red Wind City, and they could already see the massive teleport formation even before entering the city from the skies.

After descending to the ground, Su Yang said to Xiao Rong before approaching the city.

"Go inside my Dantian for now. If we go like this, it’ll cost twice as much since we’re two people."

Xiao Rong nodded and went inside his Dantian.

Some more hours later, he arrived at the scene, and it was a spacious area with a large stage in the middle of the city. On the stage was a complicated formation as well as a massive mirror made of jade with its center empty.

"It’s been a while since I have seen one of these..." Su Yang mumbled with a smile on his face.
