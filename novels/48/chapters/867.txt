Chapter 868 - Visiting the Sun Family Again (2)

"T-That uniform... A-Are you two perhaps from the Profound Blossom Sect?" The receptionist immediately fixed her posture and straightened her back after she realized who she was dealing with.

"Yes, we’re from the Profound Blossom Sect. I am Sun Jingjing, and we’re here to see my parents."

"So you’re the Sun Family’s Young Lady! Please forgive me just now! I had no idea—"

"You can skip that talk. Just bring me to my parents." Sun Jingjing quickly interrupted her.

"Right away!"

The receptionist didn’t dare to linger any longer and brought them to the largest room in the restaurant, where the Sun Family and six other families were sitting around a massive table that was filled with delicious-looking food.

*Knock* *Knock*

"Esteemed guests, you have a guest." The receptionist said to them from the outside.

"Guest? We’re not expecting any guests! Shoo them away!" An unfamiliar voice quickly resounded.

"But these guests are..."

Before the receptionist could even continue, another voice resounded, "We don’t care who it is! Even if he’s god himself, we’re currently in an important business meeting!"

"Don’t worry, I will handle this." Su Yang said to her with a smile on his face before taking a step forward and opening the door.

"Hey! We already said that we won’t be seeing any visitors! Are you deaf or what?! Get out!" A middle-aged man immediately shouted when he heard the door open before turning to look at who just opened the door, and to his surprise, it was a handsome young man wearing a familiar-looking uniform.

"T-Those robes... The Profound Blossom Sect?" The people there quickly recognized their uniforms.

"Su Yang and Jingjing? What are you two doing here?" Sun Ren stood up and stared at them with a gawking look on her face.

"What did you just say?" The other people in the room also turned to look at them after hearing the name ’Su Yang’.

And sure enough, they came to a realization, which greatly shocked and terrified them!

To think that they’d come all this way to create a good relationship with the Sun Family so that they could one day potentially meet Su Yang just to offend the man they admired himself! One can only imagine what these people are feeling right now, especially the person who directly shouted at Su Yang.

Su Yang swept the crowd with a calm gaze and said, "I guess your little meeting is more important than my woman saying her final goodbyes to her family, huh?"

The place was dead silent, as nobody there dared to speak under his immense presence.

"Wait a second... What do you mean by final goodbyes?" Sun Quan, Sun Jingjing’s father, stood up and asked them with a dazed look on his face.

"Hm? The old man didn’t tell you?" Su Yang raised his eyebrows.

"We’re both leaving this world soon to go to the Divine Heavens, and Sun Jingjing will be leaving with me," Su Yang explained the situation to him in a single sentence, leaving him speechless.

After a moment of silence, Sun Ren said, "Sorry for the inconvenience fellow guests, but our Sun Family has decided to postpone the meeting until tomorrow."

"D-Don’t worry about it! We completely understand!"

"That’s right! We’ll definitely be back here tomorrow!"

"Take your time! If you need another day or two, just let us know!"

The six families there quickly packed their things and left the restaurant in a hurry.

Once everyone left, Sun Ren pointed to the empty chairs and said, "Sit down."

Su Yang and Sun Jingjing took a seat.

"Now, tell me what’s going on."

Sun Jingjing nodded and said, "I will be leaving this world to go with Su Yang to the Divine Heavens, and I am here to say my goodbyes."

"When are you leaving?"

"In a few days," she responded.

"What?! So quickly?! Why haven’t you told us about this until right before you leave?!" Sun Ren exclaimed.

"I have tried! I even sent you letters, but I never got any back!" Sun Jingjing said.

Sun Ren immediately became speechless.

After a moment of silence, she said, "We... We have been receiving hundreds of letters every day recently so we decided to stockpile, but alas, we accidentally destroyed it, and your letter was probably somewhere within that pile... I’m sorry..."

"Then you cannot blame me for not notifying you! I thought you didn’t care or something, hence the silence!" Sun Jingjing said.

Su Yang then said, "Well, there’s still a couple of days left before we leave. You can stay here until we leave and make use of whatever little time you have left."

Sun Jingjing nodded, "I will do that." Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

"Guess we’ll have to cancel all appointments for the next few days." Sun Quan said.

Although it’ll push back all of their upcoming business by an entire week, nothing was worth more than spending time with his own daughter who will be leaving shortly.

"What about you, Su Yang? Are you going to stay as well?" Sun Ren asked him.

Su Yang shook his head and said, "Unfortunately, I still have a lot of things to do, so I can only stay here for a few more hours."

"I understand. Then go back to the house for now." Sun Ren said.

Sometime later, after paying the bill, the Sun Family returned to their home in the City of Yuan on Su Yang’s flying treasure, and they proceeded to spend the next couple of hours talking about Sun Jingjing’s future and Su Yang’s plans.

"Will you two ever return to this world to visit?" Sun Ren asked.

"We’ll try, but we cannot make any promises." Su Yang said.

"I see... Well, tell me more about your plans."

Once it was Su Yang’s time to leave, he returned to the Profound Blossom Sect, leaving Sun Jingjing behind at her home with her family for the next few days.
