Chapter 696 - There’s No Harm in Being a Little Forceful, Right?

"How long will it take to get to the Eastern Continent?" Zhu Mengyi asked a few minutes after they left the Holy Central Continent.

"About two days," Xie Wang said.

"Only two days?!" Zhu Mengyi’s eyes widened with shock, as she had expected somewhere around two months!

Even Wu Jingjing and Lian Li were surprised to hear that it would only take them 2 days to reach the Eastern Continent, as they always thought each continent was over tens of millions of miles away.

"Let me know when you need help, Su Yang," Xie Xingfang said to him.

"It’s fine, this is good training for me, who has an immense amount of spiritual energy," Su Yang said.

"If you need to recharge your energy, you can let me know, Su Yang, and I will gladly assist with my body!" Zhu Mengyi said with a shameless smile on her face.

"M-Me too!" Wu Jingjing said despite feeling embarrassed about it.

"I will also..." Lian Li said in a mumbling voice.

Su Yang nodded, and he continued to focus on controlling the flying ship.

A few hours later, Su Yang stopped to rest.

Seeing this opportunity, Zhu Mengyi handed Zhu Jiayi to Wu Jingjing before grabbing Su Yang by the arm and pulling him into one of the rooms inside the ship.

"You can focus on recovering your energy and let me do all of the work!" Zhu Mengyi said to him as she eagerly removed her clothes.

Su Yang nodded, and he laid on the bed with his eyes closed.

Zhu Mengyi then loosened his clothes just enough for his lower sword to reveal itself.

Seeing the awakened dragon, Zhu Mengyi licked her lips in a s.e.xy manner before she placed it into her mouth. Once Su Yang’s dragon and her own phoenix were soaking wet, Zhu Mengyi inserted it into her cave and began riding it as though she was riding a horse.

And since he was constantly being supplied with spiritual energy through Zhu Mengyi’s Yin Qi, Su Yang was able to control the flying ship even as they cultivated.

Once he’d recovered enough spiritual energy, Su Yang began moving on his own and switched roles with Zhu Mengyi, becoming the one to please her instead whilst still controlling the flying ship.

A few hours later, when Zhu Mengyi could no longer continue, she said to him, "W-Wait a moment, Su Yang... I will bring Sister Jingjing in here to help you too..."

After putting her clothes on in a hasty manner, Zhu Mengyi went outside to speak with Wu Jingjing.

"Sister Jingjing, do you want to help Su Yang? I can no longer continue," Zhu Mengyi said to her.

"Okay." Wu Jingjing nodded before handing the babies to Zhu Mengyi and heading into Su Yang’s room.

"He’s cultivating while simultaneously controlling the flying ship? As expected of an Alchemist— his concentration and ability to multitask are simply astounding..." Xie Wang mumbled after seeing this.

"At this rate, we’ll return to the Eastern Continent in a day..." Lord Xie said.

"Umm... Senior Lian, can I speak with you for a moment?" Xie Xingfang suddenly approached Lian Li.

"Sure." Lian Li nodded and walked to another corner of the ship where they’re alone.

"What do you have for me?" Lian Li then asked.

"Well... This may seem a bit inappropriate, but I would like to know your thoughts on something. You... who is the princess from a family that rules over an entire continent... how are you able to accept a man who is already being shared by other women? And how do you feel about having your man shared by other women?" Xie Xingfang asked her.

"..."

Lian Li did not immediately respond and pondered for a moment before speaking, "I can see where you are coming from— because of our status, we are naturally more selfish than others due to the environment we grew up in. In fact, the higher one’s status, the more ’sharing’ anything becomes a taboo."

"I also refused Su Yang’s advances at first because I knew he already had children with another woman, but after I realized that I wanted to stay by his side no matter what... Well, you know the rest."

"It’s actually pretty easy to throw away even the most important things in life to be with someone you truly love— is something I learned through experience. Of course, everyone is different, but I found it relatively easily."

"I see... Thank you for your time, Senior Lian," Xie Xingfang bowed to her before walking away.

’In the end, she’s just repeating what grandfather already said but in a different fashion...’ Xie Xingfang sighed inwardly.

’Why is it so hard for me? Or is it simply because I do not love Su Yang enough to toss away my pride?’ Xie Xingfang proceeded to stare into the horizon with a dazed expression on her face.

A few hours later, Wu Jingjing returned to the outside and looked at Lian Li.

"You don’t have to say anything, I’ll go next." Lian Li said to Wu Jingjing before she could even open her mouth.

A moment later, Lian Li entered Su Yang’s room to cultivate with him.

"Hey, are you going to do something about that princess outside?" Lian Li suddenly asked him.

"You mean Xing’er? Why do you ask?" Su Yang raised his eyebrows.

"Well... I feel like she’s the type that won’t be able to decide something on her own. I can tell that she really likes you even though we barely know each other, but there’s something preventing her from approaching you. Since she already likes you, there’s no harm in being a little forceful, right?" Lian Li said to him.

"I understand your intentions, but I won’t force her. I have had experience with many women who are very similar to Xing’er, and I can tell you from experience that it’s better to let her decide for herself, or it might create conflicts in the future," Su Yang said.

"Is that so..." Lian Li nodded.

A few moments later, they began cultivating.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎
