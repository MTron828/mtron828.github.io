Chapter 767 - Dew of Life

After their private conversation, Su Yang and Emperor Lian returned to Lian Li and Feng Xindou’s side.

"Are you okay?" Feng Xindou asked Emperor Lian afterward when she saw his sweaty face.

"Yes, I am okay." Emperor Lian nodded.

A few moments later, he turned to look at Su Yang and spoke, "Anyway, what do you want? Surely, you didn’t come all the way here just to ruin my marriage, right?"

Su Yang smiled and said, "I need ingredients and treasures."

"Ingredients again? We gave you everything you asked for just a few days ago! Furthermore, we even gave you more than you needed!" Emperor Lian said with a dumbfounded look on his face.

"I know, but I need other ingredients this time, and there’s a good chance I won’t be able to find them in the Eastern Continent, so I am traveling to every continent to see if I can find them there."

Su Yang then handed Emperor Lian a list of medicines.

"Well? Do you recognize any of these?"

After looking at the list, Emperor Lian shook his head and said, "No, I don’t."

However, Feng Xindou pointed to one of the names on the list and said, "I know of the Dew of Life; it’s an incredibly rare treasure that has only appeared once 1,000 years ago, and it was auctioned off for a few hundred million spirit stones at that time."

"Oh? Who bought it? Do you know if they still have it or not?" Su Yang asked.

"If I recall correctly, it should be the Ruan Family. However, whether they still have the treasure or not I have no clue. I’m sorry that I cannot be more useful."

Su Yang shook his head and said, "No, this information is more than enough."

Sometime later, Feng Xindou turned to look at Lian Li and said, "I didn’t get to say this before but congratulations on becoming a mother, Li’er."

"Thank you, mother."

"Anyway, I’ll give the Ruan Family a visit right now. Once I return, I will help you." Su Yang said with his gaze on Feng Xindou.

Feng Xindou nodded and said, "I’ll prepare myself in the meantime."

"Do you want to stay here with them?" Su Yang asked Lian Li next.

"Will you be okay by yourself? The Ruan Family is one of the top families in the Holy Central Continent. It might be difficult to meet with them if I am not with you," Lian Li said.

"My daughter is right, Su Yang. Although I won’t call them unreasonable, the Ruan Family does not like outsiders. It will be better to have Li’er with you." Feng Xindou said.

Su Yang chuckled and said, "Don’t worry, I have a plan. They’ll meet me even if they don’t want to. Lian Li, you can stay here and spend some time with your family. After all, once you leave this world with me, you won’t get such chances anymore."

"If you say so..." Lian Li nodded.

"As long as that plan doesn’t involve destroying the Ruan Family or involve us..." Emperor Lian added afterward.

"By the way, where is this Ruan Family?" Su Yang then asked.

"You can find them 200,000 miles to the west within a city called Crane City," Feng Xindou said.

A few minutes later, Su Yang left the building with Xiao Rong and traveled to this Crane City.

Meanwhile, after talking with Lian Li for a little longer, Feng Xindou went to the bathroom to clean her body in preparation for her treatment.

As for Emperor Lian, he returned to his own room and retrieved the cultivation technique Su Yang gave him and began practicing it.

Sometime later, Su Yang arrived at Crane City with Xiao Rong sitting on his shoulder in her cat form.

"Where can I find the Ruan Family?" Su Yang asked the guards at the entrance before entering the city.

"The Ruan Family? They’re currently away from the city to participate in the annual gathering with a few other families," said the guard.

"What business do you have with the Ruan Family? Depending on the urgency, I might be able to help," said another guard who belonged to the Ruan Family.

"I am here to talk to them about the Dew of Life," said Su Yang.

"Dew of Life?"

The guards looked at each other before they burst out laughing.

"Hahaha! Don’t tell me you’re here for their Dew of Life, too?" The guards then asked him. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

"Don’t even bother, young man! The Ruan Family won’t hand it over to anybody no matter what you offer them."

Su Yang raised his eyebrows, and he said, "So they still have the Dew of Life? That’s good to know."

"Of course. The Dew of Life is an incredibly rare treasure that is said to have the ability to resurrect even the dead. What could possibly be worth more than a person’s life?"

"Resurrect the dead? Which idiot spread such a rumor?" Su Yang shook his head. "The treasure may be rare, but it isn’t that powerful or has any practical use."

"Anyway, where can I find the Ruan Family now?" Su Yang then asked.

"Didn’t you hear what I’d just said? The Ruan Family won’t trade or sell the Dew of Life for anything! You’re basically wasting your time right now," said the guard.

"That’s fine. I have nothing else to do anyway," Su Yang shrugged.

The guard sighed, and he said, "You can find them at Wuxi City with the Gao Family and many other top families. They’re only a few thousand miles to the north. Don’t say I didn’t warn you, though."

"Many thanks," Su Yang said to the guard before flying away, feeling quite fortunate that the Dew of Life existed in this world.

Sometime later, Su Yang arrived at a small city.

"Is this Wuxi City?" Su Yang asked the guards there.

"Yes. What business do you have here?"

"I’m looking for the Gao Family— mostly the Ruan Family that’s with them, though."

"The Gao and Ruan Family? They should be at the Ancestral Pavilion right now," said the guard.
