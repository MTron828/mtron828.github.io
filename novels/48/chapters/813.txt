Chapter 814 - Upcoming Gathering

After taking Lu Youyi’s Pure Yin Essence for himself, Su Yang spent the next hour thrusting his rod into Lu Youyi’s slender body, overwhelming her with pleasure and delight.

In the end, Su Yang released a bucket load of Yang Qi into her cave, filling her body to the brim with his hot liquid.

"Thank you, Su Yang, for this experience... I’ll never forget it." Lu Youyi said to him afterward.

"Don’t even mention it," said Su Yang with a handsome smile on his face.

After putting his clothes on, Su Yang continued, "I’ll go tell your parents that you are completely healed."

"Okay." Lu Youyi nodded.

As Su Yang approached the door and placed his hand on the door, Lu Youyi said, "I really hope that I get to see you again, Su Yang..."

"I’m sure we’ll meet again sometime in the future," he said to her before leaving the room.

After speaking with Lu Youyi’s parents for a couple more minutes, Su Yang prepared to leave the Southern Continent with Lian Li and Xiao Rong.

"Then I’ll come back later with a date for the meeting so everybody can come together and talk about the teleportation formations," Su Yang said to them before leaving.

"I’ll be waiting for you here. Once again, thank you for saving our daughter, Esteemed Guest. We’ll never forget your kindness for the rest of our lives."

The Lu Family bowed to them as they took off in the flying treasure, returning to the Eastern Continent.

After returning to the Eastern Continent, Su Yang explained the situation to Liu Lanzhi and other sect elders, as it would affect the Profound Blossom Sect in the future whether they like it or not.

"Connecting all of the continents together, huh? I could’ve never imagined that such a day would come... At least not during my lifetime," Liu Lanzhi sighed in admiration as she stared at Su Yang, as everything he does seemed to have an impact throughout the entire world.

"The Profound Blossom Sect will become a major power in not just the Eastern Continent but also the other continents, hence why you’ll also be participating in the meeting when it happens," Su Yang said to her.

"O-Okay..." Liu Lanzhi swallowed nervously, as she cannot imagine being in the same room as all of the top families and powers from around the world.

"There’s no need to be nervous. I’ll be there with you as well." Su Yang said to her.

"Un," she nodded with a resolute look on her face, yet her heart was still beating nervously even many minutes later.

"By the way, how’s Senior Lian? She should be giving birth soon, right?" Liu Lanzhi suddenly brought up the topic of Lian Li’s pregnancy.

Su Yang nodded and said, "Should be a couple more months."

Unlike mortals, cultivators who are pregnant usually require more time to give birth, since absorbing spiritual energy somehow slows down the process, and once a cultivator is powerful enough, it could take even decades to give birth after their pregnancy.

"Do you intend on finding a doctor for assistance when the time comes? Or do you know how to deliver babies?" Liu Lanzhi couldn’t help but ask him.

"I have delivered a decent amount in the past when I wandered around as a doctor for the experience. However, this will be my first time delivering a baby that’s mine. It’ll be a new experience, definitely," said Su Yang with a weird smile on his face.

"Are you excited? Nervous?"

"I’m more delighted than anything," he responded.

"I can imagine." Liu Lanzhi chuckled.

"By the way, how’s Shi Yuchun?" Su Yang suddenly asked her.

"I heard from the other disciples that she’s hard at work. Every morning, she would sweep the floors until lunch and then sweep some more afterward. The sect feels much cleaner thanks to her. Of course, we’re also teaching her how to become a manager so when there are more workers, she’ll be able to lead them."

"I see... I’ll talk to her later as well."

After talking for some time, Su Yang left Liu Lanzhi alone and went to speak with Shi Yuchun for some time before returning to his daily routine of cultivation with the disciples.

A couple of days later, a messenger from the Xie Family knocked on the Profound Blossom Sect’s gates.

"This is an official letter from His Majesty, Lord Xie, and it is to be handed to Sect Master Su Yang without delay," said the messenger.

"Please, follow me."

After confirming this messenger’s identity, one of the sect elders brought the messenger to the Yin Yang Pavilion to wait for Su Yang to return. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Su Yang returned to the Yin Yang Pavilion a few hours later after he finished his routine.

"Greetings, Sect Master Su Yang. This is from His Majesty, Lord Xie. Please accept this." The messenger handed Su Yang an official scroll with a unique stamp on it.

"What’s this?" Su Yang asked as he accepted the scroll.

"I’m not sure either, since His Majesty commanded that only you can open it, nor did he mention its contents."

Su Yang nodded and opened the letter to read its contents.

A few seconds later, he mumbled, "Oh, so it’s about the gathering. Why’d he make it seem like it was top secret?"

"The gathering?" Liu Lanzhi raised her eyebrows.

"Yes, I asked him to help me gather all of the powerful families in the Eastern Continent for a quick meeting," he explained, and he continued, "I can finally ascend to the Sovereign Spirit Realm."

"T-The Sovereign Spirit Realm?" Liu Lanzhi stared at him with wide eyes, as she cannot imagine someone so young reaching the peak of the cultivation world— at least this world’s peak.

"When is the gathering?"

"According to Lord Xie, it’ll happen next month." Su Yang said, and he turned to look at the messenger and continued, "Tell Lord Xie that I have received the information and that I’ll be there in a month."

"I shall relay this message to His Majesty. Thank you, Sect Master Su Yang." The messenger bowed to him before leaving.
