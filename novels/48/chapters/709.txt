Chapter 710 - Purple Qilin's Blood

After squeezing out the last drop of his Yang Qi into Xie Xingfang’s body, Su Yang removed his divine rod from her hole before sealing it with a talisman to contain his Yang Qi inside her body for guaranteed fertilization.

"Su Yang..." Xie Xingfang looked at him with a passionate gaze as she laid on the mattress with her body completely exhausted and glistening with sweat.

"How do you feel?" Su Yang asked as he laid beside her.

"Like I am dreaming..." she said in a low voice and a warm smile on her face.

Su Yang chuckled at her answer before smearing some of his blood onto the Family Seal that had appeared on Xie Xingfang’s body.

"I am going to cultivate a bit," Su Yang then said to her.

Sometime later, a profound aura emitted from Su Yang’s body as he had a breakthrough, reaching the ninth level Heavenly Spirit Realm.

"You can continue to rest up here while I wait for the Purple Qilin. Now that I also have the Thousand Poisons Body, I no longer have to worry about the poison mist," he said to Xie Xingfang.

And before leaving her side, Su Yang formed a concealment formation around the flying boat so that Xie Xingfang could rest peacefully.

After returning to the Purple Qilin’s nest, Su Yang found a place to sit down and continued cultivating. Although he now has the Thousand Poisons Body from taking Xie Xingfang’s v.i.r.g.i.nity, he still needed to control it and slowly merge it with his physique so that it won’t affect the rest of his body in the future. And since he has already done this over 100,000 times with 100,000 Heavenly Constitution, the process was completed as easy as it was breathing.

Of course, since the Thousand Poisons Body originally belonged to Xie Xingfang and he simply absorbed some of its power, it wasn’t as powerful as the ’Thousand Poisons Body’ and was only as effective as the Hundred Poisons Body.

If Su Yang really wanted the original strength of the Thousand Poisons Body, he would need to use some evil cultivation technique to forcefully take Xie Xingfang’s Heavenly Constitution for himself. However, that would result in Xie Xingfang losing her Heavenly Constitution, and only evil Cultivators would resort to such foul tactics.

With that being said, even though his Thousand Poisons Body is not powerful as it should be, it was more than enough to resist the poison mist within the Abandoned Forest. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

After waiting a couple of hours, Su Yang suddenly opened his eyes.

A second later, the earth trembled, and a loud roar resounded above him as the Purple Qilin appeared.

"So you’re finally back, huh?" Su Yang mumbled as he stood up and looked at the Purple Qilin that was emitting the power at the peak of the Heavenly Spirit Realm, which was far stronger than what Xie Wang had estimated.

*ROOOOOOAR*

The Purple Qilin released another ear-piercing cry when it saw that a human had invaded its territory that also housed its unborn child.

"Let’s get this over with. I don’t like the air in this place; it smells like shit." Su Yang calmly approached the Purple Qilin with Sword Qi radiating from his body.

The Purple Qilin immediately rushed at Su Yang with its mouth wide open before it suddenly spat out a large blob of toxic spit at him.

Boom!

The Sword Qi around Su Yang exploded, destroying the toxic spit before it could even reach him.

"How disgusting." Su Yang shook his head, and he casually waved his sleeves.

Whoosh!

An enormous arc of sword light suddenly flew at the Purple Qilin.

And just as the Sword Qi was about to slice the Purple Qilin in half, it suddenly jumped back and disappeared into this portal, dodging the Sword Qi.

Su Yang raised an eyebrow after seeing this, but he did not panic.

After a moment of silence and stillness, Su Yang suddenly turned around while swinging his arm.

Whoosh!

Another blade of Sword Qi flew from his arm, yet there was nothing in the direction that he’d just attacked.

However, a second later, a portal appeared where the Sword Qi was flying, and right as the Purple Qilin popped its head out of the portal, the Sword Qi was already in front of its face.

Sha!

The Purple Qilin was immediately beheaded, and the rest of its body fell out of the portal a second later.

Su Yang immediately retrieved multiple vials from his storage ring to collect the Purple Qilin’s blood until he had over a hundred vials of Purple Qilin blood which was more than required to heal Xie Xingfang’s condition.

Once he’d collected nearly all of the Purple Qilin’s blood, Su Yang went to pick up the large egg inside the nest before returning to Xie Xingfang’s side.

"Do you have the Purple Qilin’s blood?" Xie Xingfang asked after seeing him.

"I do. Are you ready to return home?"

She nodded.

After storing the mattress back into his storage ring, Su Yang controlled the flying ship and flew back to Snowfall City with Xie Xingfang sitting directly beside him and with her head resting on his shoulders, looking like intimate couples.

Sometime later, they returned to the others.

"Su Yang! Xing’er! You’re back! Do you have the Purple Qilin’s blood?!" Xie Wang greeted them with a nervous face.

"Yes, they’re right here." Su Yang showed him the vials.

"Ahahaha! This is perfect! Now Xing’er can finally be healed!" Xie Wang laughed in excitement.

Meanwhile, Lord Xie was silently staring at Xie Xingfang with a puzzled expression on his face.

’Is it just me or is there something different about Xing’er?’ he wondered to himself.

He then noticed that Xie Xingfang was standing much closer to Su Yang than she normally would in the past— so close that they were nearly clinging to each other.

As for the three ladies with Su Yang’s Family Seal, they immediately realized the situation once they saw Xie Xingfang and felt a connection with her.

’So you’ve finally accepted your feelings, huh?’ Lian Li said to herself with a slight smile on her face.
