Chapter 829 - Four Great Families' Gathering

Once he’d finished concocting all of the pills, Su Yang turned to look at Wang Shuren and Bai Lihua and said to them, "Go ahead and grab 10,000 Heaven Transcendence Pill, 25,000 Earth Advancement Pill, and 5,000 of the others for each of you; it should be enough to last your sects for many decades to come."

Wang Shuren and Bai Lihua nodded their heads and immediately went to accept their portion.

Meanwhile, Senior Zeng watched them with envy.

’Why didn’t the Divine Nature Garden get its own share? Are we not good enough for him?’ Senior Zeng wondered.

Su Yang suddenly turned to look at Senior Zeng and said, "Don’t worry, I didn’t forget about you guys."

"I..." An embarrassed smile appeared on Senior Zeng’s face when he realized that Su Yang saw through everything.

"Here, take this." Su Yang suddenly tossed a storage pouch at Senior Zeng.

Senior Zeng hastily went to catch it.

"What’s this?" he asked afterward.

"Open it and you’ll see," said Su Yang with a smile on his face.

Senior Zeng nodded his head and opened the storage pouch and retrieved whatever was inside.

A couple of scrolls appeared.

"This is?" Senior Zeng raised his eyebrows as he opened one of them.

"T-This is!"

Once he realized what was written in these scrolls, Senior Zeng’s jaw dropped to the ground.

"These are the pill recipes for the Heaven Transcendence Pill, Earth Advancement Pills, and other pills I’m not familiar with!" He exclaimed a moment later.

"The Heavenly Swan Sect and the Profound Blossom Sect have no alchemy masters that can concoct these pills, and in the entirety of the Burning Lotus Sect, only Wang Shuren has the ability to concoct these pills. Therefore, I concocted the pills for them. The Divine Nature Garden, however, has plenty of experienced alchemy masters, so I won’t be spoon-feeding you guys," said Su Yang. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

And he continued, "If you want to sell the pills as well, you must concoct your own."

Senior Zeng immediately bowed to him and said, "Thank you for this opportunity, Su Yang! I’ll keep these pill recipes safe even at the cost of my own life!"

Once Wang Shuren and Bai Lihua obtained their shares, Su Yang said, "I’m going to deliver half of these pills to the Xie Family now. Lanzhi, you can take the other half for the Profound Blossom Sect."

After collecting half of the pill bottles left, Su Yang left the Profound Blossom Sect and went to the Xie Family.

Meanwhile, Liu Lanzhi went to gather the remainder of the pills before storing them inside the treasury hall for the Profound Blossom Sect.

"This place... it’s getting filled to the brim with treasures..." Liu Lanzhi admired the luxurious sight in the treasury hall, something she didn’t think would be possible.

Ever since Su Yang started improving the Profound Blossom Sect, their treasury hall has been piling up with treasures and spirit stones on a daily basis.

"We might need a bigger place to store the treasures at this rate," she mumbled.

Sometime later, Liu Lanzhi returned to the Yin Yang Pavilion, where Elder Sun was waiting for her.

"Elder Sun, what’s the matter?" she asked him.

"Sect Master, it’s almost time for our disciple examination again."

"Has it been a year already? Time passes by so fast these days..." Liu Lanzhi said.

"Anyways, gather the other elders and meet me in the meeting area," she continued.

"I understand." Elder Sun nodded.

Meanwhile, at Snowfall City, the first thing Su Yang did after entering the Xie Family’s household was check on Xie Xingfang’s condition and their children.

"How are you guys fairing?" Su Yang asked her, who was still lying in bed with the twins sleeping soundly beside the bed in their own little cradle.

"As you can see, we’re doing perfectly fine." Xie Xingfang said with a smile on her face.

"How’s your body? Let me inspect it."

Xie Xingfang nodded.

After locking the doors, Su Yang removed the blankets covering her as well as her clothes.

"Hmmm..."

Su Yang proceeded to inspect the slit between her legs for a minute before nodding, "It’s recovering at a good pace. It should be fully healed by next week."

"I cannot wait. It’s been a while since we... you know..." Xie Xingfang said with a slightly bashful look on her face.

After hundreds of cultivating sessions with Su Yang, Xie Xingfang was beginning to say things she never thought she would ever say in her lifetime.

Su Yang chuckled after hearing her words, and he said, "We’ll do it as many times as you want after your body recovers."

Xie Xingfang nodded with a smile on her face.

After spending some more time with Xie Xingfang and their children that were sleeping peacefully in their cradles, Su Yang went to find Lord Xie, who was currently in another meeting.

"Oh? Look who we have here..." Su Yang entered the meeting room without knocking and smiled upon seeing the familiar faces in the room.

"Who dares!"

The people there immediately turned to the door and shouted.

However, when they saw Su Yang’s handsome face, they immediately turned silent.

"Su Yang? What are you doing here?" Su Xun looked at Su Yang with a surprised look on his face.

"I can say the same to you. What’s this? A meeting between the Four Great Families?" Su Yang said.

Inside the room, Su Xun and the other Four Great Families were present.

The Fang Family that rules the Western Region, the Xiang Family that rules the Southern Region, the Su Family that rules the Northern Family, and lastly, the Long Family that rules the Eastern Region and also the only family from the Four Great Family that Su Yang hasn’t encountered before.

"You came at the perfect timing, Su Yang. We were just talking about the teleportation formation. Would you like to join us?" Lord Xie did not mind his intrusion and even asked him to participate in their meeting.
