Chapter 968 Leaving the Brothel

After leaving the Scarlet Phoenixes, Su Yang returned to the Pink Light District and showed the tall middle-aged man the scroll he’d obtained from Feng Tianwei.

"Heavens... You actually managed to buy Mei Ying?" The man was greatly surprised since he was aware of how difficult it was to buy their women, as many customers have tried to in the past but to no avail.

Once the man confirmed that the stamp on the scroll belonged to Feng Tianwei, the man nodded, "I understand. Mei Ying is no longer part of the brothel. I will give you her ownership papers in a few minutes, please wait here while I look for it."

’Ownership papers?’ Su Yang raised his eyebrows, feeling like he was buying a slave from them.

A few minutes later, the man handed Su Yang Mei Ying’s ownership paper and said, "As long as you have this, Mei Ying is yours."

Su Yang accepted the paper and looked at it for a second before using his alchemy flames to burn it until there was nothing left.

His actions left the middle-aged man speechless, but Mei Ying was no longer his problem, so he didn’t really care about it.

"I will return tomorrow for her."

Su Yang then left the place and returned to the massage parlor to cultivate until morning.

"Good morning, mother." Mei Xing woke up later than her mother, which was very rare.

And to her surprise, Mei Ying was packing for some reason.

"Morning, Mei Xing."

"What are you doing?" Mei Xing asked her.

"A little something," she responded with a mysterious smile on her face.

Mei Xing tilted her head in a puzzled manner, but she didn’t continue to ask since she knew that Mei Ying was keeping it a secret for some reason.

Once Mei Xing finished washing her face, she prepared to leave.

"I am going to work now, mother," she said as she approached the door.

However, right as she reached the door, someone knocked on it.

"It’s me, Xiao Yang."

"Manager? What are you doing here so early in the morning?" Mei Xing asked him after opening the door.

"I’m here to escort you to your new living quarters," he said.

"Eh? New living quarters? We’re moving?" Mei Xing turned to look at her mother with a questioning expression on her small and cute face.

"Yes, we’re going to move out and live somewhere else starting today."

"W-Why?" Mei Xing asked.

"You’ll find out later," she chuckled.

"Have you finished packing?" Su Yang asked her a moment later.

"Yes, there wasn’t much to pack anyway."

Su Yang then used his storage ring to carry the luggage and said, "Let’s go. I have already picked a place for you."

"Thank you." Mei Xing nodded.

As Mei Ying approached the door, Su Yang noticed that she was having difficulty walking, most likely because her body was still recovering.

He then lowered his body and showed his back to her and said, "I will carry you."

"I-I don’t dare to inconvenience you any further..." Mei Ying kindly refused.

"It’s okay. I am a cultivator, so I most likely won’t even feel your weight," he insisted.

Mei Ying eventually gave in and nodded her head.

She then laid her light body on Su Yang’s back.

Su Yang stood up a moment later, carrying her on his back.

Mei Ying quickly began blushing. Although she looked like she was in her early twenties, she was actually in her late thirties, and it was embarrassing for someone at her age to be carried around in such a manner.

Mei Xing stared at her mother and Su Yang with a profound look on her face, but she remained silent.

Sometime later, Su Yang walked downstairs and left the building with Mei Xing following behind them.

They then walked to the hotel that was only a street away from the Heavenly Massage.

Of course, they attracted a lot of attention, especially since almost everyone in the Pink Light District knew of Su Yang’s reputation.

"Who’s the woman being carried by Xiao Yang?"

"No clue."

"Hey, I recognize her. She’s a pretty popular escort for mortals from a cheap brothel not far from here. What’s she doing with someone like Xiao Yang?"

"They look pretty intimate with each other. Do you think they’re ’that’?"

"Impossible. There’s no way Xiao Yang would have any special relationship with a mortal whore when he has hundreds of beautiful women lining up at his business every day. He’s probably just helping her."

Once they arrived at the hotel, Mei Xing looked up at the tall and luxurious building in front of them with a dazed face.

"W-We’re going to live here? Mother, I don’t think we will have the money to live at such a luxurious place even with my income..." Mei Xing said a moment later.

Mei Ying looked at Su Yang from behind and said in a surprised voice, "M-Manager, are you sure? This place looks incredibly expensive. We will be satisfied even if it’s just an ordinary hotel."

"This is the only place near the Heavenly Massage that still has available rooms," he said in a calm voice.

"W-We can walk even if it’s a little far," she then said.

Su Yang smiled and said, "It’s okay."

He then walked inside the building and teleported to the top floor using a minor teleport within the hotel.

"Here’s your room. I have already rented out this room for an entire year so you don’t have to worry about that."

"An entire year? Manager, how much did it cost?" Mei Xing couldn’t help but ask.

"If I tell you, you’ll have to pay me back the full amount, okay?" Su Yang said to her with a joking smile on his face.

However, Mei Xing took his joke seriously and immediately began sweating.

"I-I will try my best to pay it back even if I have to sell my body!" she responded in a shaky voice.

Su Yang chuckled and said, "I am only joking. You don’t have to pay me back."

"Mei Xing, I have told you multiple times that you shouldn’t even think about selling your body! Unlike me, your body is still pure and very precious, so you must keep it pure for your significant other in the future!" Mei Ying scolded her afterward.

"Manager, you can put me down now," she then said to him.

Once Su Yang put her down, she bowed to him, "Thank you for carrying me all the way here."

Su Yang nodded, and then he handed her the keys to the room.

"Go rest. If you need anything, you can just speak with one of the workers standing by in the hallway. They will be there all day. I have to open up the store soon, so I will speak with you later."

Su Yang left the hotel shortly later.

"See you later, mother!"

Mei Xing said to her before following Su Yang.

Once she was alone, Mei Ying laid on the bed and proceeded to stare at the beautiful ceiling with a dazed look on her face.

She would remain in that state for many minutes while wondering if she was dreaming before falling asleep.

After returning to the massage parlor, Su Yang immediately opened up the store.

’Mother still hasn’t said anything about why we suddenly had to move. The Manager even paid for the hotel...’ Mei Xing wondered this for the remainder of the day while she greeted the customers.

About two hours after the Heavenly Massage opened, the business owners in the Pink Light District were surprised to see a certain individual from the Red Light District show up in their district.

"H-Hey, isn’t that Madam Feng Tianwei from the Red Light District? What’s someone like her doing out here in the Pink Light District?"

"I have no idea, but it’s not often you see people from the Red Light District here. I think it’s been over 10 years since someone from the Red Light District visited this place, and that person wasn’t even nearly as influential as Madam Feng!"

"L-Look! She’s actually lining up with the others at the Heavenly Massage! Don’t tell me that she came all the way here just to get a massage?!" Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The business owners were shocked to see the famous Feng Tianwei standing in line outside a massage parlor like an ordinary customer.

Although Su Yang’s massage parlor is incredibly famous within the Pink Light District, it has not seen a famous or influential customer until Feng Tianwei showed up.

"Once news spreads that even Madam Feng from the Red Light District showed up for his massage, his massage parlor will blow up even more!"

The business owners there were in awe but also envied Su Yang’s business that had exceeded all of their expectations, and it was all done in such a short time.

"Welcome to Heavenly Massage!" Mei Xing greeted Feng Tianwei when it was finally her turn.

Feng Tianwei raised her eyebrow at this little girl working as the receptionist. This massage parlor was more eccentric than she’d anticipated, and the environment didn’t match the quality of this place.

In her eyes, the Heavenly Massage was a cheap place with a real dragon upholding it, something one wouldn’t normally expect.

"I want a massage," she said to Mei Xing.

"The waitlist is currently three weeks long if you don’t mind."

"T-Three weeks?!" Feng Tianwei was shocked to hear this.

Although she knew this place was popular from the rumors and because of the number of customers waiting outside, she didn’t expect it to have a waitlist for 3 whole weeks.

However, this was a problem. Would she be able to endure waiting three more weeks before she could experience Su Yang’s massage again?
