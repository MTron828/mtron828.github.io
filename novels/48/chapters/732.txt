Chapter 733 The Xiang Family

"We’re here for Cai Yan," Senior Zeng said to the guards after approaching them, as he was sure that they would not be able to recognize Su Yang as Senior Xiao.

"Lady Cai..."

The guards exchanged nervous looks with each other.

"Is there something wrong?" Luo Yixiao noticed the weird atmosphere around them and decided to ask.

"Well... How should I say this... The Young Lady is currently in a meeting with the Xiang Family," one of the guards said.

"The Xiang Family? Do you mean ’that’ Xiang Family?" Luo Yixiao showed a surprised look after hearing this family name.

"Xiang Family? Why does it sound so familiar?" Su Yang raised an eyebrow in a puzzled manner, yet he cannot recall why he found this family name so familiar.

"The Xiang Family is one of the Four Great Families in the Eastern Continent from the Southern Region," Senior Zeng said with a profound expression on his face.

"But why would one of the Four Great Families be here? And what do they want from the Cai Family, much less Cai Yan?" Senior Zeng mumbled.

"The Xiang Family is actually here with a marriage proposal, as they want our Young Lady to marry their Eldest Son, Xiang Zhongfa." The guards explained the situation to them.

"Marriage proposal?" Senior Zeng and Luo Yixiao looked at each other.

While the Cai Family is a pretty powerful family in the Eastern Continent, they are nowhere near as powerful as one of the Four Great Families, so it didn’t make sense for the Xiang Family to be the one to approach the Cai Family for a marriage proposal, as it should be the other way around.

However, if they consider one thing, then that might change the entire scenario.

Senior Zeng and Luo Yixao realized this almost simultaneously, and they turned to look at Su Yang. Perhaps the main reason why the Xiang Family is proposing marriage is because of Cai Yan’s status as Su Yang’s disciple.

If that was the case, the Xiang Family has every reason to approach the Cai Family, as being the disciple of one of the most powerful and renowned Alchemy Masters in the world gave Cai Yan near unparalleled status that surpasses even the Xiang Family, one of the Four Great Families.

"Regardless of what they are doing, I am going to pick Cai Yan up." Su Yang said as he ignored the guards and walked into the building.

"W-Wait a second, young man! You can’t just—"

"Don’t bother," Senior Zeng placed his hands on the guard’s shoulder and shook his head. "You don’t want to stop him."

"W-Why? Who is that young man? He looks very familiar, but I cannot..." The guard asked him.

"That’s Su Yang from the Profound Blossom Sect," Luo Yixiao said.

"The Profound Blossom Sect?!" The guards exclaimed in a shocked voice.

Nowadays, the name Profound Blossom Sect is widespread throughout the continent and mentioned no matter where people went, and then Su Yang’s name would be mentioned in the same sentence somewhere down the line.

However, the guards became puzzled the next moment. Since when did their Cai Family have any relationships with the Profound Blossom Sect, much less their number one genius Su Yang?

Meanwhile, inside one of the rooms within the Cai Family’s household, Cai Yan was seated beside her parents with the Xiang Family sitting across from her.

Not including the servants they brought, the Xiang Family consisted of two people— a beautiful middle-aged woman and a handsome young man in his late twenties.

"So? What do you say to my Xiang Family’s marriage proposal?" The middle-aged woman suddenly said.

"Well..." Cai Yan’s parents turned to look at their daughter with a nervous expression on their faces after being pressured by the Xiang Family to give up Cai Yan to the Xiang Family— or more specifically, the young man sitting only a few feet from them.

Though, it was not as though the Xiang Family directly threatened them to give Cai Yan to them, only subtly hinting at it.

"What do you think, Yan’er? The Xiang Family is one of the Four Great Families, and the person you’ll be marrying, Xiang Zhongfa, is a very talented Cultivator who has reached the Earth Spirit Realm before 30 years old! I don’t think you’ll regret becoming his wife." Cai Yan’s father said to her, clearly siding with the Xiang Family.

After all, no sane person would refuse a marriage proposal from one of the Four Great Families!

However, Cai Yan suddenly lowered her head and said, "I’m sorry, but I will have to refuse this marriage proposal."

"What?!"

Everybody in the room looked at her with wide eyes.

"Why did you refuse? Am I not good enough for you, Fairy Cai?" Xiang Zhongfa exclaimed in a surprised voice, sounding as though he was in disbelief. After all, this is his first time being rejected by a woman!

"No, it has nothing to do with you, Young Master Xiang." Cai Yan shook her head.

"Then why? I won’t leave without an explanation!"

"Because I simply do not have the time for something like marriage. I am currently studying Alchemy, and that is already time-consuming enough. If I marry you, I won’t have time for Alchemy or vice-versa." Cai Yan calmly explained.

"That’s pure nonsense!" The middle-aged woman suddenly interrupted, and she continued, "You are merely using that as an excuse! There are plenty of women out there who are Alchemists and married! There are even some who have children! Yet you dare claim that you won’t have time for my son?! That’s outrageous!"

"Madam Xiang, please calm down... I’m sure my daughter did not mean it like that..." Cai Yan’s mother spoke up for her.

Meanwhile, Cai Yan remained calm and said, "While that is true, I am not just any Alchemist. I am Master Xiao’s disciple, who is the number one Alchemy Master in this world."

"You..." Madam Xiang was speechless when Cai Yan brought her Master into the discussion, instantly turning the tide.

"Well said!" An unfamiliar voice suddenly resounded in the room, causing everybody there to look at the door.
