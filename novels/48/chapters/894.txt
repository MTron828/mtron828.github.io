Chapter 895 - Frozen Asgard

"Su Yang almost got fooled by that pervert Li Menghua? Heavens... I could have never imagined... No wonder why he seems to hate men..." Mu Yuechan muttered to herself.

Sometime later, Mu Yuechan asked him, "Do you have anything else to say or ask?"

Su Yang pondered for a moment before speaking, "Yeah. Can I borrow some money?"

"What? You’re asking me for money? I should be charging you for taking up my precious time!" Mu Yuechan looked at him with a frown on her face.

’This is the first time I have seen someone this shameless— or not... Su Yang was also pretty shameless if not even more shameless than this fatty...’ she thought to herself.

"I think the information I gave you just now is worth more than just conveying a message. Don’t you agree?" Su Yang suddenly said.

"How much do you want?" she asked.

"Just enough to get to the Frozen Asgard from this place."

"You’re really planning on traveling to the Frozen Asgard with your cultivation base? As a Sovereign Spirit Realm cultivator, you’ll definitely die before you can even reach the Frozen Azure Cave that’s deep within the Frozen Asgard," Mu Yuechan said to him.

"Are you worried about me? Thank you, but you don’t need to be worried. I have my own ways to survive," said Su Yang with a smile on his face.

"Che! Who’s worried about you?" Mu Yuechan sneered in a cold manner before placing a storage pouch on the table.

"Take it and get out. You have already lingered around for far too long. I have other customers, too," she said in a cold voice. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Su Yang accepted the storage pouch.

"Thank you, Mu Yuechan," he said.

Su Yang stood up and prepared to leave.

However, right as he reached the door, Mu Yuechan spoke in a serious and chilling voice, "I don’t care who you are or what you’re planning to do with all that information about the Su Family, but if they are hurt because of it, I swear I will hunt you down and skin you alive, fatty."

And she continued, "Don’t underestimate me. I have connections within every corner in the Four Divine Heavens. You won’t be able to run or hide even if you run to the end of the universe!"

Su Yang turned around with a profound smile on his face, and he said, "I know. Thank you."

Mu Yuechan was surprised when Su Yang thanked her again despite her threatening words, and there was even a hint of adoration within his tone.

This creeped Mu Yuechan out.

"G-Get out!" she quickly said to him after feeling a shiver down her spine.

After Su Yang left the building, Mu Yuechan quickly cleared out the queue that had built up because of Su Yang’s long stay.

After that was done, she closed the store down and disappeared somewhere.

Sometime later, Su Yang and Xiao Rong left the Tower of Intelligence and the city.

"Wow, 200 high-grade spirit stones? She gave a generous amount." Su Yang was surprised when he looked inside the storage pouch that Mu Yuechan had given him despite her complaining.

Now with a total of 220 high-grade spirit stones, Su Yang no longer had to worry about his travel expenses to the Frozen Asgard, as he’d planned on selling some more of his Yang Qi to fund his travel expenses.

"Are we going to this Frozen Asgard place now, Master?" Xiao Rong asked him once they entered the skies on their flying treasure.

Su Yang nodded and said, "That’s right. Frozen Asgard is a unique place in the Celestial Heaven that’s a virtually uninhabitable ice-covered landmass spanning for hundreds of thousands of miles, and it is also considered a ’danger zone’."

And he continued, "A danger zone is as the name suggests— an incredibly dangerous area that shouldn’t be traversed unless you’re prepared. There are magical beasts ranging from the Sovereign Spirit Realm to the Ancient Spirit Realm, and the deeper we go, the more dangerous it’ll get."

"The place we’re going to is called the Frozen Azure Cave that exists deep within the Frozen Asgard. It is also an incredibly popular place that attracts countless experts every 10,000 years because of a treasure that grows inside."

"Although it may seem risky to go to such an incredibly dangerous place, it’s really not that dangerous as long as you know the way around the area. There are these hidden passages you can follow to avoid most of the magical beasts. Unless we’re incredibly unlucky, we shouldn’t run into any extremely dangerous entities."

Xiao Rong nodded calmly, "Okay."

"But first, we must head to the Song Province."

They proceeded to spend the next couple of days traveling to a city that had a teleport formation.

"The Song Province? That’ll be 60 high-grade spirit stones." The man working the teleport formation said to him.

Since the Song Province was literally on the other side of the world, teleporting to that place would require a large number of spirit stones.

The moment Su Yang appeared on the other side, he felt the temperature drop sharply.

"Haaa..."

Every breath he took would be followed by a cloud of water vapor from his mouth.

’It’s been a while since I have experienced such cold climates...’ Su Yang thought to himself as he got off the platform.

As a cultivator at the Sovereign Spirit Realm, his body would naturally protect him against the cold. However, despite that, Su Yang still planned on getting some special clothes, as the cold wind at Frozen Asgard could penetrate even a cultivator’s spiritual energy.

While he can avoid the magical beasts through secret passages, it was impossible to avoid the cold in that place.

After walking around the city for some time, Su Yang entered a tall building with an expensive sign at the entrance that read ’Crystal Armory’.
