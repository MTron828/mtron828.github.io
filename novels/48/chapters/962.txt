Chapter 963 I Will Take Care of You and Your Daughter

Mei Ying stared at the beautiful pill sitting at the edge of the bed with a silent gaze.

"Also, I will still reserve you for the entire week, but if you want to continue working, that is your choice."

"If you’re afraid of your customers getting angry and hurting you for it, you can quit working here and come to my massage parlor. It’s called Heavenly Massage, and it’s only a couple of streets from this place. I don’t mind having an extra pair of hands around the place in case I need it."

"If you decide to come work for me, I will take care of you and your daughter for as long as I can. Although I won’t remain in the City of Pleasure forever, I can help you leave the city and also make sure you have everything you need to live a peaceful life for the rest of your lives."

Mei Ying stared at Su Yang with her eyes as wide as saucers.

After listening to Su Yang’s words, she couldn’t help but ask him in a low voice, "Why...? Why are you doing so much to help us? You barely know us..."

Su Yang then said, "When I look at Mei Xing, I see an energetic and determined little girl who has ambitions bigger than she can fully understand. Even though I have only known her for two days, I want her to be successful in life, and from the way I see it, you are what’s keeping her ambitions alive. If you die... so will Mei Xing alongside her ambitions."

Mei Ying was left speechless by Su Yang’s words. This is the first time she has met someone who cared so much about her family.

"I..."

"You don’t need to say anything." Su Yang interrupted when Mei Ying tried to speak.

"Take your time to decide."

Su Yang then removed the formation in the room and opened the door.

"Are you finished speaking with my mother?" Mei Xing asked him after seeing him leave the room.

"Yes. You can stay here with your mother for the rest of the day. I will return to the massage parlor. See you tomorrow."

"Okay! Thank you, Manager! I will work even harder starting tomorrow!" Mei Xing nodded with a bright smile on her face.

Su Yang patted her head for a moment before walking down the staircase and exiting the building.

"E-Esteemed guest! Is everything okay?" The tall middle-aged man greeted him.

Su Yang nodded and said, "Here’s another medium-grade spirit stone. I am going to rent her for the rest of the week. Do you have any problem with that?"

The middle-aged man trembled inwardly when he felt a domineering aura that didn’t match his appearance around Su Yang, and he quickly shook his head, "No problem at all. Mei Ying is all yours for the entire week, esteemed guest."

"Good. And in case you get any funny ideas, I only work a few streets away from this place."

"Absolutely not! I wouldn’t dare to do anything funny!" The man said.

Su Yang nodded and walked away in a calm manner.

’Just who is that young man? I have never seen him before even though I have lived in the Pink Light District for many decades now.’ The man wondered to himself.

"Is everything okay, mother?" Mei Xing asked her after Su Yang left, as she could feel that something was amiss about her.

"You look kind of sad..."

Mei Ying smiled and said, "You’re just imagining things. Come over here so I can hug you."

Mei Xing nodded and got on the bed.

She then noticed the pill on the bed and picked it up.

"What’s this?" She asked.

"Oh... That’s a medicine pill the Manager gave me. He said it’d help with relaxing my body even more. Can I have it?" Mei Ying said.

"Here you go." Mei Xing handed her the pill while completely unaware of the true circumstances.

"Thank you." Mei Ying took the pill before hugging Mei Xing.

"Mother, you’ll catch a cold if you continue being naked, and the bed is still wet. Allow me to clean it for you." Mei Xing said to her a moment later.

"Okay. I will go take a shower as well."

While her mother went to clean her body, Mei Xing changed the dirty bedsheets and blankets for new ones.

Once Mei Ying returned, she wore a piece of mature pajamas that barely covered her body which wasn’t any better than being completely naked. Though that didn’t matter once they went under the warm blankets.

"What do you think of the Manager? He’s just like I said, right?" Mei Xing asked her sometime later.

After a moment of silence, Mei Ying nodded, "Yes... You were right. He’s a wonderful person. If he stayed any longer, I might’ve even fallen for him."

"Ooooh! Does this mean you will accept the Manager if he wants to be with you? I would love to have the Manager as my father!" Mei Xing quickly said.

"Let’s not get ahead of ourselves, Mei Xing. We live in two completely different worlds, and there’s no way he’d want a dirty woman like me." Mei Ying sighed. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

"Mother, don’t say something like that! You’re not dirty at all!" Mei Xing said with a pouting face.

"Alright... I am sorry... I won’t say something like that again— I promise," she said.

Mei Ying eventually fell asleep while hugging Mei Xing, as she was incredibly exhausted after receiving Su Yang’s massage.

Once Mei Ying was deep asleep, Mei Xing quietly got out of the bed without waking her mother up, and she took a seat by the window where there was some light source, and she proceeded to take out the cultivation technique Su Yang gave her, studying it for the entire night without sleeping.

Despite her young age, she was aware that those without talents must work twice as hard if not even more than those that were born with talents. Thus, she could only sacrifice her sleep to try and cultivate, as she has work in the morning and half of the afternoon.
