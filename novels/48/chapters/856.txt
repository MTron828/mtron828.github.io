Chapter 857 - Celebration

Days passed in the blink of an eye, and it was already the day of the celebration.

"Where’s Su Yang?" Xie Xingnfang asked the others from the family when she couldn’t find him.

"I haven’t seen him today." Sun Jingjing said.

"He went somewhere early in the morning, but I haven’t heard from him since then." Lian Li said.

The ladies all shook their heads, unaware of Su Yang’s whereabouts.

"How could he suddenly disappear on the day of the celebration?" Lord Xie was dumbfounded.

"Don’t worry, I’m sure he’ll show up in a little." Liu Lanzhi said to them, and she continued, "Here, I’ll even contact him with the communication jade slip."

However, Su Yang’s voice resounded right as Liu Lanzhi pulled out her communication jade slip.

"There’s no need. I’m here." Su Yang said as he entered the room wearing luxurious red clothes.

The ladies were immediately mesmerized by his handsome appearance, and their minds went completely blank.

"S-Su Yang...?" Xie Xingfang mumbled his name, almost like she was at a loss for words.

"That’s right. I’m Su Yang," he responded to her with a dazzling smile on his face.

And he continued, "I had asked for this outfit to be made sometime back, but it wasn’t completed until this morning. What do you guys think?"

"W-What do we think...?"

The ladies swallowed nervously after a brief imagination, feeling a strong urge to s.e.x.u.a.lly assault him at this moment.

"I think you look amazing, Su Yang." Xie Xingfang eventually snapped out of her daze and said to him.

"I’m glad you like it." Su Yang said with a smile, not telling her that he’d made the outfit specifically with her taste in mind.

"Anyways, are you all ready for the celebration?" He then asked them.

"Y-Yes, we are..." Lord Xie nodded.

"Then let’s get it started."

The place was also filled with thousands of dining tables and countless foods.

"Greetings, Your Majesty, Your Highness, and Seniors!" Everybody there greeted Su Yang and the others regardless of their background.

"Thank you all for gathering here today for my daughter, Xie Xingfang, and Su Yang’s celebration." Lord Xie said to the people there.

"This celebration is to celebrate Xie Xingfang and Su Yang’s union as well as their newborns, Su Yuying and Su Tianying!"

"First, let us cheer for Su Yang and Xie Xingfang’s union! Cheers!" Lord Xie chugged the alcohol that was rich with spiritual energy down in his throat in a single motion.

"Cheers!"

Everybody at the celebration followed him and chugged their alcohol as well, feeling their cultivation base increase slightly afterward.

"Next, we shall cheer for their newborns, Su Yuying and Su Tianying! Cheers!"

"And lastly, this is to their eternal happiness together! Cheers!"

"Cheers!"

After drinking three cups of alcohol that could also be considered a treasure, Lord Xie gave everyone there a short speech before handing the spotlight to Xie Xingfang and Su Yang.

"If you have anything to say, now’s your chance." He said to them.

Xie Xingfang went first, expressing her delight for her situation as well as her gratitude to them for showing up.

After Xie Xingfang’s speech, Su Yang also gave a short speech, mostly about how blissful he is for having Xie Xingfang by his side and how he’ll take care of her forever.

After their speech, they began eating.

Of course, while they ate, some families there approached Su Yang and Xie Xingfang with even more gifts.

"Thank you very much."

Even though they accepted every gift as a sign of courtesy, Su Yang had no intention to keep these treasures for himself and planned on giving them to the Xie Family and the Profound Blossom Sect.

After the celebration that came and went in a flash, the guests left Snowfall City in waves, and Su Yang and the others returned to the Profound Blossom Sect, where they’d continue to spend their last few weeks cultivating with each other for as much as possible.

As for the Xie Family, they were too busy counting and organizing the treasures they’d obtained from the celebration, which increased the volume of treasures in their treasury by a whopping 50 percent.

"This is the most treasure we’ve ever gotten in such a short time frame!" Lord Xie stared at the mountain of treasures in the treasury room with glistening eyes.

"Unfortunately, no amount of treasures will be able to replace Xing’er and the children’s presence." Xie Wang sighed.

And he continued, "Once they leave this world, there’s a good chance that we’ll never see them again. Although it’s not like they’re dead... It certainly feels similar."

"Don’t say such depressing things, father. I have been trying to get that off my mind and here you are, bringing it back up..." Lord Xie shook his head.

"Xing’er is a grown woman now. She has her own future and path to take. We cannot always be there for her, especially not in this boundless cultivation world."

Sometime later, Xie Wang left the treasury room and went to spend some time with the twins.

Back at the Profound Blossom Sect, Su Yang prepared to build Xiao Bai’s new home that was situated outside the Profound Blossom Sect while still remaining within their territory.

"What are you planting, Su Yang?" Fang Zhelan asked him as she watched him plant seeds.

"Do you remember what I gave you in that past to feed Xiao Bai?" Su Yang responded with a question.

"Do you mean the Seven Silver Blades? Is that what you’re growing?"

He nodded and said, "That’s right. Seven Silver Blades will cover this land in a few months, allowing Xiao Bai to eat as many as she wants in the future, and it’ll even regrow naturally, so it will essentially never run out."

"I see... Let me help you!" Fang Zhelan then said, taking some of the seeds off his hand.
