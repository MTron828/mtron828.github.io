Chapter 649 - Taking Responsibility

After leaving Sect Master Zhu’s room, the Xie Family was led to their temporary living quarters by the disciples whilst Su Yang returned to Zhu Mengyi’s living quarters with Wu Jingjing.

"I cannot believe it! Su Yang actually has children! Two of them, at that! And with two different women!" Xie Wang exclaimed after they settled down in their large house.

"He’s the last person in the world I’d expect to have children!" Lord Xie also shook his head.

"What do you think about this situation, Xing’er?" Xie Wang asked her a moment later when she remained silent.

"Is it really that shocking that someone as talented and handsome as Su Yang would have children? I’m sure there’ll be plenty of willing women lined up if he asked," she responded in a surprisingly calm voice, and she continued, "I am more interested in the mothers. How can they endure having the man they’ve conceived with impregnating other women and be fine with it, even remaining in a friendly relationship with them. I simply cannot understand their feelings..."

Xie Xingfang shook her head and sighed, "Perhaps if I can understand their feelings I will finally be able to accept Su Yang despite the shortcomings of such a relationship..."

Hearing her words, Xie Wang and Lord Xie remained silent, as they did not know how to respond to such words.

Meanwhile, in Zhu Mengyi’s living quarters, Su Yang sat on the bed with his daughters still in his embrace.

"They really like you, Su Yang. So much so that even I am starting to feel jealous," Zhu Mengyi spoke in a joking voice.

A few moments later, Wu Jingjing asked him, "Su Yang, how long do you think you’ll be staying in the Holy Central Continent this time?"

"A week at most," he quickly responded. "Once we have the Four Elements Root, we will immediately return to the Eastern Continent and concoct the poison immunity pill. After all, Xing’er’s condition is worsening as we speak, and we don’t know how long her body will be able to endure the poison."

"That girl... is she your lover?" Zhu Mengyi asked him after gathering her courage.

"No, she’s not," he shook his head.

"Really?"

They looked at him with wide eyes.

"Why would I lie to you?" He responded with a smile.

A few minutes later, Su Yang said while looking at the two babies in his embrace, "It appears that the little ones have fallen asleep."

"Let’s put them in the other room for now," Zhu Mengyi said.

Su Yang nodded and followed them to another room, where two toddler cribs were already built right next to each other.

Once the children were placed into their beds, Su Yang and the others returned to the other room.

"By the way, I’m surprised the two of you knew each other. What a crazy coincidence that you both wanted to be i.m.p.r.e.g.n.a.t.ed by me," he said to them with a smile.

"You’re telling us that!? You have no idea how shocked we were when we found out that we were i.m.p.r.e.g.n.a.t.ed by the same man! I almost thought I was dreaming when I learned the truth!" Zhu Mengyi said to him.

"Because of our parents’ relationship with each other as the Sect Master of the Three Ancient Academies, we have known each other since we were young. However, it is truly a miracle that our daughters have the same father." Wu Jingjing said afterward.

Su Yang chuckled, "You two sure have a close relationship with each other— to the point where you even cultivated with each other. When did you begin doing it with each other?"

"H-H-How do you know that!?"

They looked at him with a baffled expression.

"I can sense your Yin Qi on each other... Even a blind man can tell if they knew what they were looking for," Su Yang said with a smile on his face.

Zhu Mingyi and Wu Jingjing exchanged worried looks with each other.

Wu Jingjing then spoke, "Su Yang, we can explain..."

"Explain? What is there to explain?" Su Yang raised his eyebrows in a puzzled manner.

"Eh? You mean you don’t mind it? Us cultivating with each other, I mean..." Zhu Mengyi asked him with wide eyes.

"Of course, not. Why would I mind it if two of my own women have to satisfy each other in my stead because I am not there for them? It’s not as if you went to another man. And even if you did, I would not have complained, since I have already stated that I cannot be in your life."

"In fact, it’s quite common for women who share the same man to be satisfying each other when the man cannot satisfy them or is absent," Su Yang explained to them, reassuring them that he did not mind them cultivation with each other.

"..."

Wu Jingjing and Zhu Mengyi stared at him in silence, seemingly speechless.

"Since we are on the topic, can I ask if either of you has found another partner that’s not each other?" Su Yang suddenly asked them.

"N-No way! Besides you, we have only cultivated with each other!" Zhu Mengyi quickly responded.

"You really think we would forget about you that easily, Su Yang? I can still feel the feeling of your hands touching me even now..." Wu Jingjing sighed. "And doing it with Sister Mengyi... she can barely satisfy my l.u.s.t."

"Hey! I am trying my best, okay?! You’re asking too much from me if you want me to satisfy you as if I am Su Yang! And I can say the same thing about you, Sister Jingjing!" Zhu Mengyi quickly said to her.

"Anyway, why are you asking, Su Yang?" Wu Jingjing ignored Zhu Mengyi and asked him.

"Well, I have changed a little since I left the Holy Central Continent, and I have given a lot of thought about what I said to you two... that I cannot be with you because of my situation."

"And after some thoughts, I have changed my mind."

"Y-Y-You don’t mean..."

They stared at him with gawking expressions with their hearts beating wildly.

Su Yang nodded and continued, "I would’ve ignored it if you had already found another partner, but since that’s not the case, I would like to go back on my previous words and say that I am willing to take responsibility for our children and the two of you, too."

"No way..."

Wu Jingjing and Zhu Mengyi gasped in shock before covering their mouths, and their eyes immediately began tearing up once their minds had comprehended Su Yang’s words.

"R-Really? You don’t mind taking us...?" Zhu Mengyi spoke in a mumbling voice, clearly trying to resist bawling her eyes out.

"You are willing to accept us?" Even Wu Jingjing could barely believe her ears.

Su Yang nodded and continued, "Yes, I am willing to accept both of you. However, you should know a few things about me before you come to a conclusion. If you are willing to accept me for who I am even after learning the truth, I will also the do same."

Zhu Mengyi and Wu Jingjing nodded with serious expressions on their faces and patiently waited for him to continue. However, even if they haven’t heard anything yet, they were pretty confident that no matter what Su Yang is about to tell them that they would be willing to accept him.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎
