Chapter 848 - I Have Been Spoiled Too MuChapter by You

"So... this is... your Family Seal..." Li Xiao Mo c.a.r.e.s.sed the symbol on her stomach in an exhausted manner, feeling as though she’d just practiced body refining rigorously for many days without any rest.

"Do you like it?" Su Yang asked her with a smile on his face.

"Yes... I love it... Very much." Li Xiao Mo nodded.

"Go take a rest. I’ll introduce you to the others later. Right now, I need to take Liu Lanzhi with me to the continental meeting."

Sometime later, after washing his sweaty body and changing his clothes, Su Yang went to the Yin Yang Pavilion to meet up with Liu Lanzhi.

"Are you ready to leave?" he asked her.

"Yes, just give me a moment." Liu Lanzhi retrieved a communication jade slip and contacted Elder Sun.

"Elder Sun, I am going to leave the sect with Su Yang now. Take care of the Profound Blossom Sect with Elder Zhao while we are away."

"I understand, Sect Master. Stay safe." Elder Sun’s voice resounded a moment later.

"Okay, let’s go." Liu Lanzhi left the Yin Yang Pavilion with Su Yang shortly after.

A few moments later, the two of them left the Yin Yang Pavilion to see Feng Xindou standing outside.

"Are you ready to return as well?" Su Yang asked her.

"Yes," she nodded with a calm expression on her face.

Sometime later, the three of them left the Profound Blossom Sect on the flying treasure and flew towards the Holy Central Continent.

Once they arrived at the Holy Central Continent, Su Yang said, "The meeting won’t start for another 2 days."

"We can stay at my family’s home until then," Feng Xindou said.

A few minutes later, they arrived at the Lian Family’s household.

"Welcome back, my dear!" Emperor Lian was ecstatic to see Feng Xindou after so many months, as he would constantly have nightmares about Feng Xindou leaving his side permanently to go with Su Yang.

"How have you been lately?" He asked her after a reunion embrace.

"Better than I could’ve ever imagined," Feng Xindou replied with a smile on her face, and she continued, "Su Yang treated me very well. I would be lying if I tell you I wasn’t reluctant to come back here."

Emperor Lian began having cold sweats after listening to Feng Xindou’s words, and he quickly said, "I-Is that so. Let’s go inside for now. We can talk more about it later."

Once they were inside, Su Yang said, "I’ll borrow one of your rooms to cultivate until the meeting."

Emperor Lian nodded and said, "Go ahead, take whichever room you want."

"Let’s go." Su Yang looked at Liu Lanzhi before he started walking.

Liu Lanzhi bowed to Emperor Lian in a courteous manner before following Su Yang to a room, where they cultivated for the next two days.

Once they were inside, Emperor Lian looked at Feng Xindou with a nervous expression on his face. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

After taking a deep breath, he said to her, "My dear, I have been practicing the techniques Su Yang gave me for the last few months rigorously, and I want to show you how much I have improved."

A moment of awkward silence later, Feng Xindou nodded her head and removed her clothes.

"If you disappoint me, I will really leave with Su Yang," she said to him.

Emperor Lian swallowed nervously. Even though he was quite confident in his improvement, Feng Xindou’s words made him a little doubtful.

In Su Yang’s room, Liu Lanzhi m.o.a.n.e.d loudly as Su Yang’s thick rod pounded her tight cave on the bed.

"Yes~"

"Aaaah~!"

"Right there— harder!"

"Wow... Your Yang Qi... It’s so much more powerful compared to the last time I cultivated with you..." Liu Lanzhi mumbled in a dazed voice as she looked at the white liquid coming out of her cave.

And she continued, "I can probably sell your Yang Qi as a treasure or something at this rate..."

Su Yang smiled at her words. If only she knew how much his Yang Qi is worth in the Divine Heavens.

Unfortunately, there was only one major dual cultivation sect in the entire Eastern Continent, and that was their own sect. If there were a few more dual cultivation sects, she could’ve definitely created a market with the disciples’ Yang Qi and Yin Qi.

With that being said, there have been new dual cultivation sects popping up in the Eastern Continent as of lately. While it might take decades, even centuries, the Eastern Continent will eventually have more powerful dual cultivation sects, allowing for them to create their own market.

"Su Yang... Do you think Feng Xindou will be able to go back to her husband and live their lives out normally?" Liu Lanzhi suddenly asked him.

"Why do you ask?"

After a moment of silence, she spoke, "Because I know that I personally won’t be able to do it."

She turned to look at him with a serious expression before continuing, "When you leave in a few months... I probably won’t be able to continue my career as a dual cultivator anymore."

"I... I have been spoiled too much by you, Su Yang. I have experienced the peak of dual cultivation with you. I highly doubt I’ll be able to feel satisfied ever again."

"You know there are still male disciples in the Profound Blossom Sect— and that I have taught them my dual cultivation techniques, right?" Su Yang asked her.

"Of course. However, how long will it take for them to reach your level if such a thing is even possible? While I don’t doubt that they’ll be amazing dual cultivators in the future— much better than our previous disciples— I doubt they’ll be able to satisfy me." Liu Lanzhi sighed with a solemn look on her face.
