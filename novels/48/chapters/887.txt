Chapter 888 - What Are You Looking At?

After lingering around his own statue for a few minutes, Su Yang turned around and prepared to leave.

"Let’s go, Xiao Rong." Su Yang said to her.

However, just as they prepared to leave, a figure suddenly descended from the heavens and approached the city.

When Su Yang felt this unfathomable pressure suddenly appear, he quickly turned around and said, "Xiao Rong, get on your knees and lower your head! Don’t look up until I tell you to do so!"

Su Yang followed his own advice and got on one of his knees and lowered his head as though he was greeting someone important.

Xiao Rong followed Su Yang’s movements and kneeled beside him.

When the other people saw what Su Yang was doing, they raised their eyebrows in a puzzled manner.

A moment later, loud noises that sounded like war drums suddenly resounded throughout the city.

When the people inside the city heard this signal, they all followed Su Yang by taking a knee and lowering their heads.

"Quickly! Get on your knees! An Immortal is coming!" The child’s father said to him.

The young boy nodded and followed his father and got on his knees.

A few moments after everyone kneeled on the floor, a figure entered the city and flew straight towards the center.

This figure then stopped and hovered directly in front of the statue for many minutes without moving.

"Two thousand years... I waited for you for two thousand years just to find out that you’d died? Are you kidding me, Su Yang?" This figure suddenly mumbled in a low voice.

When Su Yang heard this voice, he subconsciously lifted his head to look at the figure in the sky despite knowing the risks.

Su Yang’s eyes widened when he saw the peerless beauty hovering only a few meters in front of his statue, and memories began flowing into his head like a sudden gush of water.

And the moment Su Yang lifted his head to glance at the beauty, she turned to look at him with a frown on her face.

She then extended her hand and did a beckoning motion with her finger.

The next second, Su Yang’s body began lifting off the ground and flew towards the beautiful lady.

’Don’t move, Xiao Rong!’ Su Yang commanded her through divine sense right as she prepared to protect him.

"What are you looking at, fatty?" The beautiful lady asked him in a cold voice that sent shivers down his spine, including the other people in that area.

Su Yang could feel his back soaked in cold sweats after hearing her voice. Whatever he says next will determine whether he lives or dies.

Of course, Su Yang didn’t hesitate and opened his mouth.

"I apologize, Immortal Fairy. My head subconsciously lifted when I heard the sorrow in your voice, as it sounded like my mother during my father’s funeral, who also passed away from grief shortly after." Su Yang responded with an apologetic smile on his face.

The beautiful lady’s eyebrows twitched after hearing his unexpected words, and the anger in her heart subdued slightly.

"Hmph!"

After a moment of silence, the beautiful lady coldly snorted before waving her sleeves, sending Su Yang back to the ground without harming him.

Then she turned around and flew away without saying anything else.

Su Yang watched her disappear with a regretful glint in his eyes. As much as he wanted to tell that beautiful woman that he was alive, he couldn’t muster the will to do so and allowed her to slip away.

Once the Immortal Fairy had completely disappeared from the place, the people there finally started lifting their heads and returning to their feet.

However, they immediately turned to look at Su Yang with unpleasant— even angry expressions on their faces. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

"You f.u.c.k.i.n.g fatty! What’s your deal?! You nearly got us all killed just now because you couldn’t control yourself!" One of them cursed at him.

"Don’t you know that you’re not supposed to look at Immortals without permission?! You could’ve killed all of us!"

Everyone there began cursing at Su Yang angrily, but Su Yang didn’t blame them, as it was truly his fault just now.

"Xiao Rong, let’s go." Su Yang didn’t linger in that place and quickly left with her.

Once they left the area, Xiao Rong asked him, "Master, why can’t we look at the Immortals?"

"Because there’s a chance that you might offend one just by looking at them wrongly, and Immortals are so powerful that they can erase an entire city as easy as breathing. There have been many situations where a mortal accidentally offends an Immortal, resulting in many innocent lives. In fact, it has happened so many times that it has become an unspoken rule that you cannot look at Immortals without their permission."

"Eventually, this unspoken rule became so common that it turned to logic. So whenever there’s an Immortal, everyone would stop moving and lower their head so that they cannot accidentally offend one." Su Yang explained the situation to Xiao Rong.

"Of course, this rule only applies to mortals who are outside. You don’t have to follow such a rule if you’re inside a sect or some private property owned by another Immortal."

"I see..." Xiao Rong mumbled in a low voice.

"Welcome to the Four Divine Heavens, Xiao Rong." Su Yang said to her with a smile on his face.

"You’ll get used to it soon."

"Anyways, I have one more place to go in this city before we can leave."

Sometime later, Su Yang led Xiao Rong to a large building somewhere in the city.

"So this place still stands even after 2 thousand years, huh?" Su Yang mumbled.

"Where are we?" Xiao Rong asked.

"This is where I used to live with Meiqi before we built the cabin outside the city," he said.
