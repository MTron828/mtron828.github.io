Chapter 1035: We Can Deal With Him Whenever We Want

After spending 30 minutes inside Su Yang's room, the female disciple has already reached her limit.

"Disciple Xiao... How about you become my partner? I will leave my current partner as long as you nod." The female disciple said to him afterward.

Su Yang shook his head, "Sorry, but I am not looking to accept a partner for now."Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

"Huh? Why not? You know you'll get kicked out of the sect if you don't find a partner within one year of your admission."

"I have plenty of time, and I will definitely acquire a partner before then." Su Yang said in a confident voice.

"Well, if you ever change your mind, you can come find me at the 58th peak."

The female disciple left his place shortly after.

By the time his first cultivation partner for the day left, three new disciples showed up at his place.

Of course, they were all from the Yin Yang Hot Springs yesterday. Although they watched the drama from afar, they had decided to give him a visit so that they could experience his mighty sword.

"Hello, Disciple Xiao. I saw what happened yesterday at the Yin Yang Hot Springs, and I admired the way you stood up to those Inner Court disciples. Would you be willing to cultivate with me today?" One of the disciples politely asked him.

"Sure." Su Yang nodded his head without hesitation.

The other two disciples looked dispirited immediately afterward.

Su Yang noticed this and continued, "Don't worry, I can also cultivate with you two today if you don't mind waiting a little. It won't be too long."

Indeed, these two disciples didn't think they would get to cultivate with him today since he's already picked a partner.

After all, most disciples in this sect can usually cultivate for days without any breaks, and since Su Yang had already picked a cultivating partner, it would only make sense to think that he would be unavailable for the next few days.

The two disciples immediately smiled after hearing Su Yang's words, but now the disciple he picked felt a little saddened, as his words indirectly ridiculed her.

"Oh, I am not underestimating you. I will guarantee you that you will leave this place satisfied. In fact, we will cultivate until you are satisfied."

The disciple nodded, feeling a lot better after hearing such words.

She followed him inside shortly after.

"How long do you think they'll cultivate for?"

The two disciples waiting outside started a conversation to kill time.

"Who knows. Maybe six hours?"

However, to their absolute surprise, the disciple came out with Su Yang after a mere hour!

"No way... They're done already?" The two disciples were in disbelief, but when they looked at the female disciple's face, she was definitely satisfied.

"Who would like to go next?" Su Yang asked the two ladies waiting outside.

"M-Me!"

"Follow me."

They went inside the house, but they returned an hour later.

"I can't believe it. You really managed to exhaust me after an hour. You're really something, Disciple Xiao." The female disciple said to him before leaving his place with unsteady movements.

The last disciple wore a different color uniform than the previous disciples and was actually an Inner Court disciple.

"If you think you'll defeat me in an hour like the other two, think again!" The disciple said with a confident smile on her pretty face.

Su Yang merely smiled at her words, and the two of them entered his room shortly after.

Meanwhile, somewhere in the sect, Elder Tou sat in his room with another disciple.

"So does Elder Chu's new pig have a partner yet?" He asked the disciple.

"Not officially, but he's been receiving a lot of disciples into his house recently. It will only be a matter of time before he accepts a partner at this rate."

"He also had some altercation with a few Inner Court disciples at the Yin Yang Hot Springs."

"I see... I guess I have underestimated this new disciple a little."

Elder Tou mumbled to himself.

"Do you want us to do something about this disciple? We can easily crush an Outer Court disciple who has no background." The disciple asked.

Elder Tou smiled and said, "What's the rush? It's just an Outer Court disciple who entered this sect by mere luck. We can deal with him whenever we want. I also don't want Elder Chu to make a complaint. It's a pain in the ass dealing with her."

"With that being said, you can still mess with him a little without killing him. He's been meeting with a lot of female disciples, right? We'll let their partners do the work for us.'

"That's a wonderful idea, Elder Tou. I'll immediately get to it."

Once he was alone again, Elder Tou coldly sneered, "How dare a pig like him cultivate with the sect's beautiful flowers! He's tainting them!"

Back at Su Yang's living quarters, the Inner Court disciple just climaxed for the 17th time.

"Looks like I was the one underestimating you this entire time, Disciple Xiao..." The Inner Court disciple gasped for air as her cave continuously leaked Yin Qi.

It's only been an hour, but both her body and mind were exhausted.

"If I'd known that someone like you was working in the City of Pleasure, I would've visited you every day."

Su Yang smiled and said, "You're free to visit me every day while I am here."

The disciple raised her eyebrow, "You make it sound like you won't be here for long when you're just an Outer Court disciple. You know, most disciples stay here for at least a thousand years before they start adventuring outside."

"A thousand years? That sounds like a lot."

"Really? How old are you?" The disciple suddenly asked him.

Su Yang never paid attention to his age since he's lived long enough.

"Around twenty something. I guess. I stopped caring long ago." He shrugged.

"What?! You're not even thirty years old?!" The Inner Court disciple was shocked.

After all, she was over 300 years old.
