Chapter 721 Compatibility

After Su Yang’s conversation with Su Liqing ended, the ladies waiting outside were finally told to come back inside.

"I am really sorry about what had just happened..." Su Liqing bowed to them afterward, and she said, "I hope it didn’t cause any misunderstandings. If it did, let’s try to clear it up now."

"As long as you’re okay and we weren’t the cause, it’s fine," Wu Jingjing said to her with a smile.

"Anyways, now that everything’s back to normal, let’s introduce ourselves again?" Zhu Mengyi said.

And she continued, "I’m Zhu Mengyi, and this is Zhu Jiayi. I am also an Alchemist, so I know a thing or two about medicine. If you need any help, you can come to me. Of course, I am nothing compared to Su Yang."

"I am Wu Jingjing, and this is Wu Min. I belonged to a sword sect in the Holy Central Continent. Although I don’t know anything about medicine, if you need someone to talk to, I am always here."

"My name is Lian Li, and I used to belong to the Lian Family in the Holy Central Continent. If you know the Xie Family of the Eastern Continent, my Lian Family is basically the Xie Family of the Holy Central Continent." Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

"It’s a pleasure to meet all of you— My name used to be Lan Liqing, but after accepting Su Yang’s Family Seal, I have decided to take his surname as my own, so I am currently Su Liqing."

"Can we call you Sister Liqing? You can also address us as such," Zhu Mengyi said to her.

"Yes," Su Liqing nodded.

"Great! Then let’s talk about your first time with Su Yang! You were his first partner after his reincarnation, right?" Zhu Mengyi then asked her.

Hearing her question, Su Liqing smiled and said, "Okay, but this might take a while, so take a seat on the bed."

Once they were all seated on the bed, Su Liqing began recalling her background and how she met Su Yang from behind her own desk.

After Su Liqing finished her story, the three ladies began telling her their own story.

Three hours later, Su Yang and the three ladies left the Medicine Hall.

However, Su Yang said to Su Liqing before leaving, "Prepare yourself because I am going to knock you up the next time we see each other."

"Un." Su Liqing nodded with a rosy face.

After leaving the Medicine Hall, Su Yang brought the three ladies to the final family member in the Profound Blossom Sect— to Zhang Xiu Ying’s living quarters.

"So this young girl is the last family member here, huh? She’s much younger than the last two." Wu Jingjing looked at Zhang Xiu Ying with interest, as Zhang Xiu Ying appeared to be the most ordinary girl they’ve met. Of course, Zhang Xiu Ying was incredibly pretty, but other than her pretty face, they were unable to sense anything unique about her. In fact, she was so ordinary compared to the others that it became her uniqueness!

"Hello, Seniors, I am Zhang Xiu Ying, and I used to be an ordinary disciple from the Burning Lotus Sect before I found Su Yang," Zhang Xiu Ying politely introduced herself.

A few minutes later, once the three ladies introduced themselves, Zhang Xiu Ying covered her mouth in surprise and said, "Wow... I really feel out of place now..."

"Don’t say that. You’re unique in your own way, and since we all have Su Yang’s Family Seal, we’re all equal no matter what background we came from— isn’t that right, Su Yang?" Wu Jingjing asked him.

"That’s right. No matter where you came from or what status you held before, as long as you are in the family, I will treat you all equally," Su Yang confirmed.

After spending some time speaking with each other, Su Yang and the others left Zhang Xiu Ying’s living quarters.

"You really surprised me just now, Su Yang." Lian Li suddenly said to him afterward. "I didn’t think you’d accept someone so ordinary into your family. Ah— Don’t get me wrong, I am not saying that’s a bad thing. I am simply used to seeing you surrounded by impressive women."

Su Yang merely smiled and said, "It may be true that Zhang Xiu Ying is only an ordinary girl compared to you princesses, but it doesn’t mean that she isn’t pleasant to be around. What I consider the most important when considering who to accept into the family is our compatibility."

"No matter how beautiful one may be, if we are not compatible with each other, there’s simply no way that I would accept them into my family and pretend I like her— that’s simply impossible for me."

"Zhang Xiu Ying may be an ordinary girl, but I enjoy her company as much as I do with everyone else in the family, and that is the only thing that matters to me."

The ladies were speechless after hearing Su Yang’s words, but they understood and agreed with everything he’d said.

"Anyway, I have a few more people that require introductions," Su Yang then said to them.

"Huh? I thought Zhang Xiu Ying was the last family member in this place," Wu Jingjing raised her eyebrows.

"Yes, that’s true, but these people are very special. Although they may not be in the family right now, I already consider them as family."

And he continued, "You’ll understand it when you meet them. In fact, one of them is actually a family member from the Divine Heavens."

The ladies looked at him with wide eyes, yet they were unable to comprehend the full meaning behind his words.

Sometime later, they arrived at the Yin Yang Pavilion.

However, before they could even enter the building, a peerless woman resembling a real goddess appeared before them with a perplexed expression on her face.

When the three ladies from the Holy Central Continent saw this goddess’s unique features, mainly her silver hair and eyes that resembled the moon at night, their eyes widened with shock.

"You are... Immortal Fairy Su Yue!" Lian Li exclaimed.
