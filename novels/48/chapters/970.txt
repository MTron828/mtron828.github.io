Chapter 971 A Second Receptionis

"I-If I can’t control myself, can I inconvenience you to snap me out of my daze so I don’t miss sleep again, Manager?" Mei Xing asked him after being told that she will experience this situation again.

However, Su Yang shook his head and said, "Unfortunately, I cannot do that, since it’s dangerous to disturb someone when they’re absorbed in cultivation."

"You may not be a cultivator now, but if I distract you while you’re being enlightened, I could ruin your chance to learn the cultivation technique."

"I see... Then I guess I can only stop studying the cultivation technique for now..." Mei Xing sighed in a regretful voice since she wanted to be a cultivator as soon as possible to earn more money.

Su Yang looked at Mei Xing with a pondering look.

A moment later, he spoke, "I think I have a solution for that."

"Really? What?" Mei Xing looked at him with hopeful eyes.

"I can simply hire another receptionist and split your work in half, so you don’t have to work every day, allowing you to have an entire day cultivating."

"Eh? If I work half as much, does this mean you’ll also cut my income in half? I cannot do that, Manager!" Mei Xing quickly refused to have her work taken away from her, as that also meant less money. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Su Yang chuckled and said, "Don’t worry, I won’t reduce your pay. It’ll stay the same."

"Then it’ll make me feel guilty instead! I am already earning much more than I deserve. If I work any less, my guilt will..."

"You will understand everything later." Su Yang said.

After a moment of silence, Mei Xing asked, "When will you find another receptionist?"

"I have already found one, but that person won’t be starting work until a little bit later due to some problems," he said.

"I see..." Mei Xing nodded without suspecting anything.

Sometime later, Mei Ying woke up from her sleep and said, "Good morning, Mei Xing..."

She noticed Su Yang afterward, "Eh? Manager? You’re here so early today!"

Su Yang chuckled and said, "I never left. I am currently occupying that room over there. I hope you don’t mind me living with you."

"O-Of course not! You paid for this hotel, anyway! You can live here for as long as you’d like!" Mei Ying quickly said.

"Manager, where have you been living until today? Don’t tell me you lived inside the massage parlor this entire time?" Mei Xing asked him.

"Yes, I have used the massage parlor as my living quarters since I didn’t really need a room." He nodded.

"Unbelievable..." Mei Xing mumbled.

Sometime later, Su Yang said, "Mei Xing, can you open up the store for me today? I will follow you in a bit since I have something to talk to your mother about."

"Okay!" Mei Xing gladly accepted the task.

Once she got the keys to the store, she immediately left the hotel and made her way towards the massage parlor that was only a minute walk away.

"You needed to speak with me?" Mei Ying asked him after Mei Xing left.

He nodded and said, "I told you that I wasn’t sure what to make you do even if you worked for me, right? I have a job for you now, but you don’t actually have to do it now. You can start working after your body is healed."

"What do you need me to do?"

"It’s actually quite simple. You’ll be doing exactly what Mei Xing is doing right now."

"You mean as a receptionist? Having two receptionists is..." Mei Ying wasn’t sure how that would work.

Su Yang then explained, "Don’t worry, you won’t be working at the same time. I will have you both rotate working days, so you will work one day while Mei Xing rests, and then Mei Xing will work the following day while you rest."

"This will give time for Mei Xing to study her cultivation technique and do other things, as she doesn’t have much time to herself since she has to work every day, and if she does it after work, there’s a good chance that she won’t get any sleep since it’s quite easy to lose track of time."

"I am perfectly fine with that. In fact, I was going to ask you to allow me to replace Mei Xing once in a while so that she could rest." Mei Ying nodded, agreeing with his plans.

"Great. Then it’s settled. I haven’t told Mei Xing that you’ll be working with us, so I will leave everything to you."

"Thank you, Manager."

"Then I will see you later."

Su Yang left the hotel shortly after.

Meanwhile, after unlocking the doors and entering the massage parlor, Mei Xing was shocked to find a naked woman sleeping inside the massage room.

’T-This lady is the one from yesterday... Did she break in when we left last night?’ Mei Xing wondered to herself, mistaking Feng Tianwei for a burglar.

’Luckily for us, the Manager doesn’t keep any money in the store...’ Mei Xing sighed in relief.

It was at this moment Feng Tianwei woke up after a great night of sleep.

"Mmm? Who are you...? Where am I...?" Feng Tianwei was still half asleep, and she’d slept so well that she had forgotten about the events yesterday.

Then she remembered everything and immediately began blushing.

’I-I actually fell asleep in his massage parlor?!’ She cried inwardly.

"I will call the authorities if you don’t leave!" Mei Xing suddenly said to her with a frown on her face.

"Authorities? For what?" Feng Tianwei looked at her with raised eyebrows.

"For breaking and entering!" Mei Xing quickly said.

"Is that so? Go ahead." Feng Tianwei got out of the mattress and went to wear her clothes.

"I-I will really do it!" Mei Xing continued.

Once she was fully dressed, Feng Tianwei returned to the mattress and sat down.

"I am waiting," she then said with a playful smile on her face.
