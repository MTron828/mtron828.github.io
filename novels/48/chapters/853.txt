Chapter 854 - Special Event

"The Spatial Device... I completely forgot about that..." Qiuyue mumbled after hearing Su Yang’s plans.

"Speaking of the Spatial Device, you gave me ownership because your cultivation wasn’t sufficient enough to control it back then. Do you want to take control of the Spatial Device now that you’re at the Sovereign Spirit Realm?" Qiuyue asked him.

And she continued, "After all, I have no use for this treasure, and you’ll probably find better uses for it than I ever will."

Su Yang nodded, "Okay. I’ll take control of the Spatial Device. Go summon it outside."

Sometime later, they went to find an empty area in the Profound Blossom Sect before summoning the large doors, dumbfounding the surrounding disciples.

"What’s that, Sect Master? It looks so familiar for some reason." One of them couldn’t help but ask him. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

"This is a Spatial Device. It’s a treasure that has its own world. It was once known as Immortal’s Treasury. Want to check it out?" Su Yang said to them.

"The Immortal’s Treasury?! I remember this treasure! It suddenly disappeared one day! So you had it this entire time, Sect Master?!"

"Can we really go inside?! I want to look at it!"

"Me too! I also want to go inside, Sect Master!"

The surrounding disciples immediately swarmed them after listening to their conversation.

"Calm down, you’ll all get the chance to go inside. In fact, I’ll leave it here for anyone that wishes to enter. There’s nothing inside, anyways."

Suddenly, Su Yang got an idea, causing him to smile.

"Listen up, everybody! I’ll postpone the entrance until tomorrow! However, here’s the kicker— I will be hiding treasures across the Spatial Device, and all of you will have the chance to obtain treasures inside!"

"What?! Really?!"

The atmosphere there immediately exploded with excitement and anticipation. They all wondered what kind of treasures they’ll be able to find inside.

"Yes! From pills to spiritual treasures— you’ll have a chance to obtain them! Of course, it won’t be very easy, as there’ll be guardians that you’ll have to defeat inside."

Despite knowing that there might be some danger inside, the disciples’ excitement remained peaked.

"I will make an announcement later. Stay tuned."

After saying these words, Su Yang entered the Spatial Device with Qiuyue.

Inside the Spatial Device, Qiuyue summoned the teleport, transporting them directly to the control room.

"I’m going to request a transfer in ownership. Just pour your spiritual energy into the crystal ball once I tell you." Su Yang said as he placed his hand onto the crystal ball.

A few moments later, he said, "Go ahead."

Qiuyue nodded her head and poured her spiritual energy inside the crystal.

A few moments later, Su Yang said, "Okay, I am now the master of this Spatial Device."

"I’m going to hide treasures all over this place now. You can do whatever you want."

"You’re really spoiling these disciples..." Qiuyue shook her head with a smile on her face.

Sometime later, Qiuyue left the Spatial Device, leaving Su Yang behind.

Once he was alone, Su Yang went to the first floor of the Spatial Device. Inside the dark and empty cave, he began hiding Spirit-grade treasures and pill bottles.

Once he’d hid around a dozen treasures on the first floor, Su Yang proceeded to the second floor— the endless grassland.

In this vast place, Su Yang had much more space to hide treasures, so he went all out hiding treasures.

Though, it could not really be called ’hiding’ since he was merely placing the treasures on the ground randomly. In other words, it’s mostly based on luck what someone obtains. Of course, there were some treasures hidden under the dirt, and these were slightly more valuable treasures.

In total, Su Yang hid over 1,000 treasures on the second floor with most of them being Earth Advancement Pills and a couple of Earth-grade spiritual treasures. And to give the disciples some challenges so they don’t just get the treasures without any effort, Su Yang summoned many True Spirit Realm and Earth Spirit Realm magical beasts to protect the treasures.

Of course, he didn’t want any disciples to die in this place so he made it so that the magical beasts would stop attacking the disciple if the disciples give up or run away, and he forbid the magical beasts from dealing any serious or fatal blows.

In the end, this little treasure hunt was for fun and a little something he wanted to give the disciples before he leaves— a final gift of sorts.

On the fake third floor, Su Yang decided to not leave any treasures at the end of the bridge since it was impossible for them to reach the end even if they were given a hundred years, much less three months.

Therefore, Su Yang made it so the teleporter to the real third floor would be available permanently.

On the third floor, where it was gloomy and desolate, Su Yang began hiding treasures. This reminded him of the time where he’d dig up multiple trash.

"Now that I think about it, this is where I met Xiao Rong. How did she end up in this place, anyway?" Su Yang pondered as he placed treasures everywhere.

Sometime later, he arrived before a black pond.

"Hmmm..."

As much as he wanted to put a treasure in the black pond, it was too dangerous for these inexperienced disciples, and he didn’t have any treasure that would survive in this black pond besides the Black Scorpion.

After hiding another thousand treasures, Su Yang left the Spatial Device and used his communication jade slip to speak with all of the disciples.

"Starting from today until the day I leave this world, all of you have a chance to earn some treasures in the Immortal’s Treasury. There will be three floors, and the deeper you go, the more rewarding the treasure. However, it’ll also be more dangerous."

The moment Su Yang ended the connection, disciples could be seen rushing out of their houses and running towards the Immortal’s Treasury.
