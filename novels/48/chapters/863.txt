Chapter 864 - Lin Shao Shang

"Come over here." Su Yang patted the space beside him on the bed.

Lin Shao Shang nodded her head and slowly approached him, looking like a timid rabbit who was aware that it was about to be eaten by its predator.

Once Lin Shao Shang said beside him, Su Yang turned to face her and laid her body on the bed.

"Are you sure you want to do this?" He asked her.

"I didn’t come all the way here just to doubt myself," she responded.

"A great response."

Su Yang chuckled a little before he reached for her clothes, loosening the top in a smooth movement and revealing her pale and round b.r.e.a.s.ts.

"Beautiful." Su Yang said in a gentle voice as his fingers reached for it.

"Mmm..."

Lin Shao Shang m.o.a.n.e.d softly when she felt Su Yang’s firm grasp on her b.r.e.a.s.ts.

While one of his hands massaged her b.r.e.a.s.ts, Su Yang used his other hand to loosen the rest of her clothes, revealing her slim figure and slender legs.

"Ah!"

Lin Shao Shang subconsciously closed her legs when she felt something touch the entrance of her pure cave.

"Relax." Su Yang said to her in a soothing voice, and almost like magic, Lin Shao Shang’s body reacted to his voice and loosened its muscles.

Once she loosened her legs, Su Yang slid one of his fingers between her slit and began rubbing it in a rhythmic motion.

"Aaah..." Lin Shao Shang’s breath quickened, and her body trembled accordingly.

"Mmmm..."

Once Lin Shao Shang’s little sister was wet enough, Su Yang positioned himself directly before it with his heavenly rod standing tall in a menacing manner.

Lin Shao Shang swallowed nervously upon seeing his majestic sword.

"Are you ready?" Su Yang asked her.

"I am." She quickly nodded, as she felt that the longer she waited, the more intimidating it would feel.

A few seconds later, Lin Shao Shang could feel her slit being spread open by a big object, and she could feel her own v.i.r.g.i.n blood sliding down her smooth skin.

Lin Shao Shang gritted her teeth and endured everything silently. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

"Don’t worry, the pain will go away soon." Su Yang said to her as he began moving.

Lin Shao Shang nodded her head, which was feeling a little light-headed after the penetration.

’I am really cultivating with him...’ Lin Shao Shang mumbled inwardly, feeling blissful, as she has had feelings for Su Yang ever since he defeated her.

Unfortunately for her, she wasn’t someone who could be honest with herself, hence why it took her so long to accept her feelings.

Of course, Su Yang already knew this, but he wasn’t the aggressive type— at least not anymore, so he decided to let her come to him naturally.

"Aaah~ Aaaah~ Aaaah~!"

The room was quickly filled with Lin Shao Shang’s e.r.o.t.i.c m.o.a.ns.

Many minutes later, Su Yang released his Yang Qi inside Lin Shao Shang.

"W-Wait... Won’t I become pregnant from this?!" Lin Shao Shang exclaimed.

Su Yang chuckled and said, "No, you won’t get pregnant. I can control my Yang Qi, which means I can decide who I want to i.m.p.r.e.g.n.a.t.e."

"You can even do something like that?" Lin Shao Shang’s jaw dropped a little after hearing that.

"By the way, you can stay here for as long as you like. I’m sure one time wasn’t enough for you, right?" Su Yang said with a smile.

Lin Shan Shang’s face immediately flushed, and she nodded in silence.

"Don’t worry, we’ll do it a few more times before I leave," he reassured her.

"Thank you!" Lin Shao Shang said.

"No, thank you for coming here and accepting me finally."

Lin Shao Shang left the Yang Pagoda shortly after, and Su Yang continued to cultivate with the next disciple in line.

"I apologize for skipping your turn like that. As an apology, I’ll treat you extra special today." Su Yang said to the disciple that just came upstairs.

The disciple’s eyes immediately flickered with excitement, and she said, "Don’t worry about it, Sect Master! I can wait as long as you want!"

Time passed quickly, and in the blink of an eye, another week had passed in this world.

"If you’re still inside the Immortal’s Treasury, you have an hour to leave." Su Yang said to the disciples still treasure hunting inside the spatial device.

When the disciples heard this, they quickened their pace.

An hour later, Su Yang forcefully teleported everyone inside the Immortal’s Treasury outside.

"So only about 10 percent of the treasures are left in here, huh? Not bad, considering how little time they had." Su Yang smiled at the results.

Once the spatial device was empty, Su Yang summoned his family— or more precisely, everyone that was going to the Divine Heavens with him.

"The Immortal’s Treasury? What are we doing here?" Su Yin asked him.

"This is where you’ll all be living until I find us a safe place in the Divine Heavens, where I can let you guys out. I cannot risk losing even a single of you during our trip to the Divine Heavens since anything can happen."

"There are houses built on the second floor, and I’d reconstruct the place a little to make it more suitable for living." Su Yang said.

While it sounded like a lot of work, Su Yang only needed to imagine the place he wanted and the spatial device would take care of everything else.

And he continued, "We’ll leave in a week so prepare yourselves and pack whatever you need."

After giving them instructions, Su Yang dismissed them so they could go prepare.

"Only a week left, huh? To think I have only spent two years in this place."

"I am almost back. Just wait for me a little longer, you all..." Su Yang stared at the artificial sky with a profound look on his face.
