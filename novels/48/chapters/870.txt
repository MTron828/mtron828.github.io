Chapter 871 - Join My Family

"Please wait!"

Seeing that Su Yang wasn’t stopping, Su Yuhan ran in front of him and blocked his path.

"Please! I beg you! Help me! I cannot continue living like this!" Su Yuhan fell to his knees with tears flowing down his face.

Su Yang glanced at Su Yuhan for a moment before walking around him.

And without looking back, he said, "You’ll eventually find a way to heal it. Just be patient."

"And how long will that take?!" Su Yuhan asked.

Su Yang shrugged, "Who knows. It could be a month from now, or it can even be ten years from now. Focus on your cultivation and time will pass by faster."

"Y-You f.u.c.k.i.n.g bastard! This is all your fault, to begin with! How dare you mess with me like this! Are you even human?!" Su Yuhan roared as he watched Su Yang and Su Yin disappear from the place.

"Forget it, Yuhan." Su Xun said to him.

"B-But—!"

Su Xun suddenly slammed the desk and shouted, "I said forget it! If you keep yapping, I will also stop helping you!

Meanwhile, Su Yang and Su Yin returned to the Profound Blossom Sect.

"Ah, that was refreshing. I have always wanted to scold that idiot but I never had the courage, and he was stronger than me at that time." Su Yin said with a smile on her pretty face.

Su Yang merely shook his head in silence and with a slight smile on his face.

Sometime later, Su Yin returned to her own living quarters while Su Yang went to Bai Lihua’s place.

"Do you have anyone you want to say goodbye to?" Su Yang asked Bai Lihua.

Bai Lihua shook her head and said with a bittersweet smile on her face, "My parents have been long gone from this world even before I became the Sect Master of the Heavenly Swan Sect. I also don’t have any close friends. I guess I’ve been living a lonely life now that I think about it..."

"Don’t worry about it too much. The cultivation world is usually filled with solitude so there are a lot of people out there like you. In fact, before I became a dual cultivator, I also had no friends and preferred to be alone. It’s just a way of life for us cultivators."

Bai Lihua nodded.

Sometime later, Su Yang went to see if Zhang Xiu Ying or Li Xiao Mo had anyone they needed to see before they left for the Divine Heavens.

He laid on the bed and pondered if there was anything he still needed to do in this world. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

"Master..." Xiao Rong appeared before him not long after he returned.

Su Yang smiled and said, "Go ahead."

Xiao Rong didn’t say anything else and immediately got onto the bed and started squeezing his Yang Qi out.

Su Yang didn’t bother to collect her Yin Qi this time and continued to ponder while Xiao Rong helped herself with his divine rod.

A few minutes later, someone knocked on his door.

"You can enter." Su Yang said.

The door opened, and Hong Yu’er walked inside.

Xiao Rong merely glanced at Hong Yu’er before ignoring her and continuing to suck on Su Yang’s straw.

Su Yang also didn’t mind it and acted as though everything was normal.

"What’s up?"

Hong Yu’er glanced at Xiao Rong for a brief moment before turning to look at Su Yang.

"We’re leaving for the Divine Heavens in a few days, right?"

"That’s right." He nodded.

And he continued, "Do you have somewhere you want to go?"

"No... I... I want to cultivate with you before we leave this world," she said to him, taking him by surprise.

"What’s this about?" Su Yang raised his eyebrows.

"The Divine Heavens is extremely dangerous, right? Anything might happen there— I might die before I even see Senior Tang again. And I don’t want to die without experiencing ’that’, so I’m going to cultivate with you before we leave."

"..."

After a moment of silence, Su Yang said, "Indeed, anything can happen there. You can die. I can also die without achieving my dreams. However, to cultivate with me just because of that... I don’t know how I feel about it."

"What if you don’t die and you find someone you love in the Divine Heavens? You will definitely regret giving me your purity at that time," he continued.

"..."

Hong Yu’er was speechless.

"Hong Yu’er, you should relax. As long as you’re with me, I won’t let you die. Even if you’re not my lover, I won’t let you come to any harm even if it’ll hurt me in the process."

"If you say so..." Hong Yu’er nodded, and she left his room shortly after.

Sometime later, once Su Yang was certain that he had nothing else to do in this world, he stopped Xiao Rong and got off the bed.

"I still have one thing I want to do before I leave..." Su Yang then left his room and went to knock on Liu Lanzhi’s room.

"Su Yang?" Liu Lanzhi greeted him at the door.

"I want to spend my last few days with you," he said to her.

"Please, come inside." Liu Lanzhi said, opening the door fully for him.

A few minutes later, they got on the bed and began kissing each other passionately.

"Liu Lanzhi, I know you have decided to stay here, and I am not going to try and convince you to follow me. However, I do have another proposal for you." Su Yang suddenly said to her.

"What is it?" Liu Lanzhi stared at him with an intensive gaze, her heart beating with anticipation.

"Join my family," he said with a serious look on his face.

"Eh?" Liu Lanzhi’s eyes immediately widened with surprise upon hearing his request.
