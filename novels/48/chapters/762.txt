Chapter 763 - Twins

Sometime later, Lord Xie finally calmed down and said to them, "Congratulations, Xing’er, Su Yang."

"Thank you, father." Xie Xingfang said.

"Do you know if it’s a boy or girl yet?" Lord Xie then asked.

Xie Xingfang nodded and said, "It’s a girl and a boy!"

"W-What?" Lord Xie’s jaw dropped to the floor. "Twins?!"

Xie Xingfang nodded again, and she said while rubbing her stomach which was much larger than Lian Li’s stomach despite being i.m.p.r.e.g.n.a.t.ed a bit later, "Yes, I am carrying twins in my stomach right now."

"Heavens... my daughter is carrying twins..." Lord Xie mumbled in a dazed voice, yet a smile appeared on his face a moment later, and he even began chuckling uncontrollably.

"Seeing you laugh is kind of creepy," Su Yang said with raised eyebrows.

Of course, Lord Xie was too happy to care about Su Yang insulting him and continued to laugh regardless.

Sometime later, Su Yang and Xie Xingfang left the place so Lord Xie could continue the meeting with the other seniors.

However, after learning about the twins, Lord Xie was in no mood or the right mindset to continue the meeting so he decided to delay it until a later date.

Meanwhile, back inside Xie Xingfang’s room, Su Yang said to her, "Aren’t you relieved now that you told him the truth?"

Xie Xingfang nodded, and she said, "Yes. As I’d expected, his reaction was exaggerated. However, I can somewhat understand my father’s feelings."

"By the way, I have been thinking about something, Su Yang..."

A perplexed look suddenly appeared on Xie Xingfang’s face, and she looked at him with a somewhat hesitant gaze, seemingly having trouble voicing her thoughts.

After sitting on the bed, she spoke in a low voice, "I... I have been thinking about my father... about what will happen to the family once I leave this world with you. Because my mother passed away before she could give birth to a son, my father has placed all of his hopes on me to continue the legacy. However, once I leave this world..."

"You want to leave behind our son in this world so he can continue the family legacy, huh?" Su Yang said with a calm voice, as he’d already predicted this situation the moment he learned that Xie Xingfang carried twins in her stomach.

"T-That’s right! But if you’re not okay with it..."

"I don’t mind," Su Yang interrupted with a calm look on his face.

"Really?" Xie Xingfang looked at him with wide eyes, as she didn’t expect him to agree so quickly and easily.

"Really." Su Yang reassured her, and he continued, "If that is your desire, I will support it no matter what. Furthermore, we still have our daughter, so it’s not as though we are leaving behind everything, and we might be able to return in the future." Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

"However, I still don’t know if we can return to this place once we leave, so you have to decide whether you really want to leave him behind or not," Su Yang then said. "Are you willing to leave him behind and possibly never see him again?"

Xie Xingfang nodded with a resolute look on her face.

"Then so be it." Su Yang said, and he continued, "When are you going to tell your father?"

"I’ll save the announcement for another day— most likely after he’s born."

After lingering around for another hour or so speaking with Xie Xingfang, Su Yang left the Xie Family and went to the Burning Lotus Sect to cultivate with Wang Shuren and lecture her.

"How are your children, Su Yang?" Wang Shuren asked him afterward.

"Wu Min and Zhu Jiayi are growing up perfectly fine, whilst Lian Li and Xie Xingfang’s stomach is developing nicely. As for Liqing..." Su Yang sighed before continuing, "It appears that she’s infertile, so I’ll have to concoct some pills for her."

"Infertility?" Wang Shuren’s eyes widened after hearing that, and she said, "What kind of pill are you concocting? You can use any ingredients you can find in the Burning Lotus Sect to make the pill if needed."

"Thank you, but the Burning Lotus Sect won’t have these ingredients. In fact, I doubt you can find them even in the Eastern Continent," Su Yang sighed.

And he continued, "While half of the ingredients can be found in the Eastern Continent, there are a few incredibly rare ingredients that might exist only in the Divine Heavens. However, I don’t plan on waiting around until we return to the Divine Heavens, so I am going to visit the other continents to test my luck there if I cannot obtain them here."

"The other continents?" Wang Shuren looked at him with wide eyes, and she asked him, "Do you know where they are?"

"I only know of the Holy Central Continent and the Southern Continent. However, I have never been to the Western Continent nor the Northern Continent, so I’ll need some help with those two places."

"Help? From whom?" Wang Shuren raised her eyebrows, as she doubts anyone in this world would have such knowledge.

"Well, I have someone who has probably seen the entire world already— and more than once," Su Yang said with a smile as Xiao Rong’s image appeared in his head.

Sometime later, Su Yang traveled to the Heavenly Swan Sect to cultivate with Bai Lihua and Su Yin before returning to the Profound Blossom Sect a day later.

"Children, huh?" Wang Shuren looked down at her own stomach with a smile on her face.

"I won’t be able to focus on improving my alchemy and reach the peak if I had children so I’ll wait until I have reached my limits or become a top Alchemy Master before I ask him..." she mumbled in a low voice.

As much as she wanted to join the other ladies and have a child with Su Yang, she also couldn’t just give up on her dreams to become a top alchemist in the Divine Heavens. Therefore, she’ll focus on alchemy first before thinking about getting pregnant.
