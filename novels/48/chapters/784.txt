Chapter 785 - The Northern Continent

The sword in Su Yang’s hands disintegrated into nothing after releasing the Heaven Consuming Strike, and Su Yang calmly watched as the cursed sword casually fell back to the ground with a somewhat arrogant feeling to it.

"Hmm... Not bad, as even a Divine-grade spiritual treasure would’ve been damaged by that attack just now." Su Yang said as he lifted his palm, using his spiritual energy to retrieve the cursed sword on the ground.

"Okay, as promised, I’ll make you my weapon for now." Su Yang then tossed the cursed sword into his storage ring before returning to Lian Li and Ji Hong.

"The cursed treasure won’t cause any trouble in the future, right?" Lian Li asked him.

"No, it won’t. Although I don’t know how cursed treasures are created, I know how to seal them or turn them back to normal spiritual treasures," Su Yang said in a calm voice. "Once we return to the Divine Heavens, I’ll free it from its cursed state and see what kind of treasure it really is."

Lian Li nodded.

"Anyway, thank you for your time and exchanging the Flower of Resurrection." Su Yang said to Ji Hong as he retrieved the flying boat and boarded it.

"N-No! I should be the one thanking you, esteemed guests!" Ji Hong bowed to them.

Su Yang and Lian Li disappeared from the Ji Family shortly after, leaving Ji Hong speechless.

"Xiao Rong. Where is the Northern Continent?" Su Yang said out loud. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

A few seconds later, Xiao Rong appeared before him after coming from somewhere and pointed in a certain direction.

Su Yang nodded and controlled the flying boat to fly in that direction.

A few minutes later, they arrived before a vast land with spiritual energy similar to the Eastern Continent if not a little bit better.

"So this is the Northern Continent, huh?"

After staring at the place for a moment, Su Yang turned to look at Xiao Rong and asked her, "Can you find the location with the strongest Cultivators here? Since the spiritual energy in this area is similar to the Eastern Continent, the strongest Cultivator should also be around the peak of the Heavenly Spirit Realm and the Sovereign Spirit Realm."

Xiao Rong nodded and began using her spiritual sense to sweep the continent.

A few moments later, she said, "This way."

Su Yang then followed behind her.

Sometime later, they arrived at this unknown mountain peak that was so high up in the air that it was on the same level as clouds, even surrounded by them.

"Hmm... second level of the Sovereign Spirit Realm, huh? Not bad considering this place is only slightly better than the Eastern Continent." Su Yang mumbled after sensing this Cultivator’s aura.

At the same time, the Cultivator that had been cultivating in peace also noticed Su Yang and the others’ presence.

"Who are you?"

A cold voice resounded, and a tall shadowy figure appeared before them a few seconds later.

"I’m Su Yang from the Eastern Continent, and I may have some business here," he said.

"The Eastern Continent?"

The shadowy figure sounded slightly shocked, and it continued a moment later in a slightly more respectful tone, "What do you mean by you ’may’ have business here? What do you seek in the Northern Continent, fellow Cultivators from the Eastern Continent?"

"We came to the Northern Continent in hopes of finding the things on this list. Let me know if you recognize any of the ones that aren’t crossed out." Su Yang said as he handed the ingredient list to the shadowy figure with his spiritual energy.

"Hmmm..."

The shadowy figure looked at the list for a long moment before speaking again, "I do not recognize any of the names on this list, but that’s most likely due to my lifestyle, as I haven’t left this peak for over 1,000 years now. Therefore, you should find someone else to see if they can recognize it."

"Is that so?" Su Yang nodded and said, "Thank you for trying."

He then turned to look at Xiao Rong and said, "Find me the next strongest Cultivator."

Xiao Rong nodded and turned around, disappearing from the scene with Su Yang and Lian Li shortly after.

The shadowy figure sighed in a deep voice after Su Yang left, "I thought that I’d reached the pinnacle of cultivation in this world, but alas, it appears that I had been a frog in a well this entire time..."

"Thank you for opening my eyes, Cultivators from the Eastern Continent..."

Meanwhile, Su Yang stopped the flying boat above a massive pavilion sometime after leaving the unknown mountain peak.

"Who dares to fly above the Ning Family’s household?!"

A loud voice boomed a few seconds later, and two Cultivators, presumably a couple, came out of the buildings and flew towards them a minute later.

"Who are you?! Do you know where you are?! You are trespassing in my— Ning Family’s territory! This is considered an invasion!" One of the figures, a middle-aged man with sharp facial features shouted at them, and he was only at the peak of the Heavenly Spirit Realm.

The other figure, a beautiful middle-aged woman, was surprisingly at the first level of the Sovereign Spirit Realm.

"Calm down. I don’t know who you are because we are from the Eastern Continent, and we need some help looking for a few ingredients." Su Yang said in a nonchalant voice.

"What? The Eastern Continent? How is that possible?" The middle-aged man exclaimed in a shocked voice.

"Are you really from the Eastern Continent?" The woman also couldn’t help but ask them.

Su Yang nodded and said, "Yes, and I am looking for the ingredients on this list."

The middle-aged man caught the list and looked through it.

"Do you recognize any of the ingredients on that list?" Su Yang asked them again a moment later.

"No, I don’t." The middle-aged man said in a cold voice before tossing the list back to Su Yang, and he continued, "Now get lost!"

Su Yang narrowed his eyes at the middle-aged man.

’This man... he’s lying.’ Su Yang thought to himself.
