Chapter 889 - Descendant

"Where Master used to live?" Xiao Rong turned to look at the large building that would qualify as a mansion before them. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Since Meiqi was a greatly respected individual, not to mention her contribution to the city as a general, she was given this large mansion to live in after she retired from the military, and that’s where she and Su Yang lived for half of their marriage before moving to the cabin outside the city.

"I can sense people in there. Let’s see who’s living here at this moment." Su Yang approached the door after standing there for a few minutes.

After knocking on the door, Su Yang waited for a few moments before someone opened the door.

"How may I help you?"

An old man that appeared to be a servant greeted them at the door.

"If you don’t mind me asking, who is currently living here?" Su Yang asked him.

The old man raised his eyebrows at Su Yang’s sudden and suspicious question, and then he said, "That would be the Jiang Family. Is there anything we can do to help you... uh... Who are you?"

Su Yang showed a bright smile on his chubby face and said, "My name is Xiao Yang, and I would like to purchase this building from you."

The old man looked at him as though he was crazy before speaking, "I’m sorry, but this place is not for sale—"

Just as the old man tried to close the door on him, Su Yang placed his foot at the crack, keeping the door from closing, and he said, "Let’s not get ahead of ourselves and come to a conclusion without the rest of the family."

The old man frowned and said, "I may only be a servant, but I am the most trusted servant in the entire family. I have worked with the Jiang Family for over 100 years. I think I know them better than you."

"Su Yang." Su Yang suddenly blurted out his name, dumbfounding the old man.

"I am a descendant of Su Yang, and I am here to reclaim his property. This place is owned by my ancestor, and according to my knowledge, he didn’t sell this place. You may not have known this before, but now you do." Su Yang said with a smile on his face.

"Uhh..." The old man was speechless.

"G-Give me a moment... I will be right back..."

It was obvious that the old man was going to speak with the Jiang Family, so Su Yang didn’t stop him from leaving.

Inside the building, the Jiang Family was filled with surprise after learning the situation from the old man.

"Su Yang’s descendant has come to reclaim his property? How is that possible? I thought Su Yang didn’t have any descendants!" The head of the Jiang Family exclaimed.

"I am also doubting his identity, Master Jiang. It is common knowledge that Su Yang was one of the most handsome men under the heavens, yet that fatty looked nothing like Su Yang. I highly doubt one of Su Yang’s descendants would look so unpleasant to the eyes!" The old man said.

The head of the Jiang Family laughed and said, "You know what? He may be a fake, but I want some entertainment. Let him in. I want to see how he’s going to make a fool out of himself."

The old man nodded before going back outside to let Su Yang inside.

"The Master would like to speak with you inside." The old man said to Su Yang outside.

Sometime later, Su Yang and Xiao Rong followed the old man to the room where the Jiang Family was waiting.

The Jiang Family nearly burst out laughing when they saw Su Yang’s round appearance, and they were convinced that he was a fake and was only using Su Yang’s name to obtain their property.

"Xiao Yang, right? Please, take a seat." The head of the Jiang Family pointed to the chairs across from him.

Once they were seated, he continued, "I’m Jiang Chen, head of the Jiang Family. I was told that you were Su Yang’s descendant and would like to reclaim this property. Do you have any proof that you’re Su Yang’s descendant?"

"Proof, huh..." Su Yang closed his eyes to ponder.

"While I do not have any solid proof, I heard from my mother that there is a secret in this building that only Su Yang and his family would know," he said a moment later.

"W-What? A secret? What kind of secret?" The Jiang Family was surprised to hear this since they’d searched the entire building countless times throughout the years without finding anything.

"I don’t know. I wasn’t told any details." Su Yang shrugged.

Then he continued, "How about it? If I can find this treasure, would it be enough to prove that I am indeed Su Yang’s descendant?"

The Jiang Family looked at each other with perplexed looks on their faces.

"Even if you can find the treasure, that doesn’t prove anything." Jiang Chen eventually said.

"If you don’t have any actual evidence, I will have to ask you to leave."

As of this moment, Jiang Chen couldn’t care less whether the fatty before him was Su Yang’s descendant or not since there was a good chance that a treasure was hidden in this place, and a treasure belonging to Su Yang would most certainly be priceless!

"I see... What a pity. Looks like I will have to let my mother know that I’ve failed." Su Yang sighed as he stood up.

"W-Wait a moment... Your mother? Who is your mother?" Jiang Chen suddenly stopped him and asked.

And without any hesitation, Su Yang blurted out a random name. Of course, this person who is supposed to be his mother was an Immortal and also a woman who he’d cultivated with in the past.

When the Jiang Family heard this name, their complexions immediately paled.

"I-Impossible! She had a child with Su Yang?! How come nobody has heard about this?!" Jiang Chen was in disbelief.
