Chapter 820 - Su Family's First Gathering

After cleaning up the place, Su Yang and Zhu Mengyi went to talk to the other ladies within the family to see if they wanted to witness Xie Xingfang’s delivery.

Wu Jingjing and Lian Li quickly agreed.

"Wow, so Sister Xingfang is really going to be giving birth first. How surprising considering that you’d been pregnant for longer," Wu Jingjing said to Lian Li.

"I am an entire realm above her in cultivation so it’ll take longer for me to give birth. I cannot imagine how long it must take for people above the Sovereign Spirit Realm to give birth." Lian Li shook her head.

"Meet us in front of the Yin Yang Pavilion in an hour. I’ll go ask the others in the meantime," Su Yang said to the three of them.

A few minutes later, Su Yang went to Qin Liangyu’s room and asked her and Xiao Rong.

"I’ll definitely be there." Qin Liangyu nodded.

As for Xiao Rong, although she has no clue what ’giving birth’ meant, she still nodded her head.

Sometime later, Su Yang went to Sun Jingjing’s living quarters and asked her the same question.

"Oh? Is it already time for Senior sister Xingfang to give birth? Of course, I will come!" Sun Jingjing nodded.

"Go meet up with the others at the Yin Yang Pavilion," Su Yang said to her.

"Okay!"

After Sun Jingjing, Su Yang went to the Medicine Hall to ask Su Liqing the same thing.

"Yes, I want to be there." Su Liqing also agreed without any hesitation. Although she cannot give birth herself at the moment, it won’t prevent her from witnessing others’ happiness.

After Su Liqing, Su Yang went to see if Zhang Xiu Ying wanted to be there.

"I’ve never witnessed someone giving birth before, but I’d like to go for references." Zhang Xiu Ying said with a slightly flushed face.

While she doesn’t expect to be i.m.p.r.e.g.n.a.t.ed by Su Yang anytime soon since she’s still too young, she will definitely bear his child in the future when the time is right.

The next two Su Yang visited were the Feng sisters.

"Since everyone is going, I will also attend." Feng Zhelan nodded.

"It’s not every day you get to witness a delivery, after all. Not to mention the one giving birth is Xie Xingfang, Eastern Continent’s princess." Fang Xiaoru said.

"Then I’ll meet you all later at the Yin Yang Pavilion," said Su Yang before leaving their place.

Once everyone in the Profound Blossom Sect was notified, Su Yang went to the Heavenly Swan Sect to see if Su Yin or Bai Lihua wanted to be there for the delivery.

"Brother’s child? Of course, I will be there!" Su Yin immediately agreed.

"I’ll also come with you." Bai Lihua said.

Su Yang nodded and said, "I’ll bring you to the Profound Blossom Sect in a few minutes. I still have one person to speak with."

After saying that, Su Yang left the Heavenly Swan Sect to go to the Burning Lotus Sect.

"What’s the matter, Su Yang?" Wang Shuren asked him as she continued to concoct her pill.

"Xing’er’s giving birth in a few days. Want to come and watch with the others?" Su Yang asked her.

"Oh? Her Highness is giving birth already? It feels like yesterday when you said she had one month left."

And she continued, "Okay, I’ll come. Just give me a few more minutes to finish this pill."

Su Yang nodded and said, "I’ll wait for you outside."

After leaving the pill room, Su Yang proceeded to wait for Wang Shuren to finish concocting her pill.

Ten minutes later, Wang Shuren came out of the pill room before following Su Yang to the Heavenly Swan Sect to pick up Bai Lihua and Su Yin on the flying treasure.

After picking up Bai Lihua and Su Yin, they returned directly to the Profound Blossom Sect, where everybody else was waiting.

"Looks like everybody here," Sun Jingjing said.

However, Su Yang shook his head and said, "No, there’s still one more person. I will be right back."

After saying that, Su Yang went back inside the Yin Yang Pavilion again.

"Oh, right. Sister Qiuyue isn’t here..."

"Now that you mention it, it feels like I haven’t seen her in a long time."

"It’s not just you. She hasn’t shown up for a while now."

Meanwhile, Su Yang knocked on the door to Qiuyue’s room and said, "Xing’er is giving birth today. Would you like to come with everyone else? The whole family will be there."

"..."

Although nobody responded to him, Su Yang knew Qiuyue was inside the room.

A few moments later, the door opened, and Qiuyue appeared before Su Yang for the first time in a long time.

"Does this mean you’ll come?" Su Yang asked her.

"Un..." Qiuyue nodded.

Even though it’s been many months since their intimate session, Qiuyue couldn’t help but blush whenever their eyes meet.

"Great. Let’s go." Su Yang turned around and began walking. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Qiuyue did not say anything and followed him outside where everyone else was waiting.

Sometime later, Qiuyue activated the large flying ship with her spiritual energy, allowing everybody to board it with ease and still have plenty of room to spare.

Once everyone was boarded, Qiuyue controlled the flying ship until it reached Snowfall City mere moments later.

When Lord Xie and Xie Wang saw the massive ship above their household, they immediately went to greet Su Yang outside.

However, when they saw fourteen top beauties, each with their unique features, following behind Su Yang like a group of housewives, they were shocked speechless, as this is the first time they’ve seen so many peerless beauties gathered in one place at once.

"D-Did you bring your whole family or something?" Lord Xie couldn’t help but ask Su Yang, regretting it a second later.

"Yes, they’re all part of my family, and they’re here to witness Xing’er’s delivery." Su Yang nodded.

"A-All of them are your family?" Xie Wang could feel sweat appearing on his forehead, as he cannot imagine how a single man can have so many beautiful partners at once.

No doubt, both Lord Xie and Xie Wang were feeling immense envy at this moment, and no matter how they tried to suppress such a feeling, their instincts as men would overcome their will.

Even though both Lord Xie and Xie Wang can have their own beautiful harem with their status, it definitely won’t be even close to Su Yang’s level, as he’d already taken all of the top beauties in the continent for himself.

Sometime later, they all entered Xie Xingfang’s room, who was laying on the bed with a thin blanket covering her body.

"Oh my, that’s a very big stomach..." Zhu Mengyi mumbled in a surprised voice after seeing Xie Xingfang’s round and large stomach that somewhat resembled a large hill.

As someone who had experienced pregnancy and given birth, Zhu Mengyi was surprised to see Xie Xingfang’s stomach being much larger than hers when she was pregnant with Zhu Jiayi.

"Unlike us, she’s carrying twins, after all." Wu Jingjing said.

"Still, that’s too big... I cannot imagine myself carrying twins after what I’d experienced," Zhu Mengyi sighed.

"How are you feeling, Sister Xingfang?" Lian Li asked her.

"A little bit full, but I’m fine overall. Thank you all for coming to see me," Xie Xingfang said to them with a smile on her face.

"We’re not just here to see you. We’re here to watch the delivery as well." Wu Jingjing said with a smile.

"There are a few faces I don’t recognize, so allow me to introduce myself..." Xie Xingfang then introduced herself to the family, as she wasn’t familiar with everyone there.

After Xie Xingfang introduced herself, the others also introduced themselves— even those that were already familiar with Xie Xingfang.

"Now that you mention it, this is the first time the entire family has gathered together," Sun Jingjing said.

While the ladies chatted, Xiao Rong suddenly approached Xie Xingfang and stared at the round stomach, seemingly intrigued by its weird appearance.

"That’s pregnancy, Xiao Rong." Qin Liangyu said to her.

"Pregnancy?" Xiao Rong tilted her head.

"Yes. When a man and woman mate, the female can be i.m.p.r.e.g.n.a.t.ed. In other words, this is how babies are made," she explained.

"Babies..." Xiao Rong mumbled, learning something new today.

Sometime later, Su Yang approached Xie Xingfang and said, "Let me check your condition."

He then checked her pulses with his spiritual senses.

A few moments of silence later, he said, "Yes, looks like you’ll give birth in a few days, and I’ll be staying here until that happens just in case."

"Okay." Xie Xingfang nodded, and she continued, "We have plenty of guest room— enough to give a room to each of you."

"We can worry about the rooms later. For now, let’s get to know each other a bit more!" Zhu Mengyi suggested.

Thus, everyone in there began talking to each other— everyone except Qiuyue, who’d left the room when they began.

When Su Yang saw this, he followed her outside.

Author’s Note: As you can probably tell, we’re getting closer and closer to the Divine Heaven Arc. The chapter releases may be slower until we reach the Divine Heaven Arc because I am taking much more time with each chapter, as I need to make sure that there are no loose ends before we enter the Divine Heaven Arc. I’ll try my best to keep the novel in win-win, but I don’t want to rush chapters and make mistakes just to remain in win-win, so if we fail win-win, this is why. Sorry for the inconvenience, and thank you for the support.
