Chapter 894 - Sacred Lands

Sometime later, Su Yang asked, "Can you tell me more about the sect that the Su Family had created?"

Mu Yuechan nodded and said, "There’s not much to say about them. The sect was created about 1,000 years ago, and they have been growing steadily since then. In fact, they’re already powerful enough to rival even some of the top sects in the Four Divine Heavens. The only thing hindering their progress is the fact that they’re only accepting female disciples."

"Their sect is also called the Lonely Fairies’ Refined Palace, and their Sect Master is Luo Ziyi."

"Luo Ziyi... Where is this sect located?" Su Yang then asked. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

"Don’t tell me you’re trying to go there? I wouldn’t do that if I were you."

"Why not?"

"Because they are located in a place where men cannot step foot inside or they’ll be killed on the spot without any chance to explain themselves."

Hearing this, Su Yang raised his eyebrows and said, "You’re telling me they’re located in the Sacred Lands?"

Mu Yuechan nodded, "That’s right. Not only are they located in the Sacred Lands, but they’re located at the very center of it."

"Indeed, this is very problematic..." Su Yang said.

The Sacred Lands is one of the most secluded areas in the Celestial Heaven that prohibits all men from entering without any exceptions, and even the Heavenly Emperor is not exempted from this rule despite being the most powerful man in the Four Divine Heavens.

Of course, this doesn’t mean it was impossible for Su Yang to meet his family.

However, such privilege was only given to the previous Su Yang. If he were to try and enter the Sacred Lands right now without revealing his identity to the world, he’d probably be slain without even getting the chance to open his mouth.

’Although it’ll be troublesome trying to get inside, this sect created by my family is definitely one of the safest places in the Four Divine Heavens at the moment. If I let them take care of Su Liqing and the others, I will be able to traverse the Four Divine Heavens in relief.’ Su Yang thought to himself, planning on leaving those in the Spatial Device at the sect created by his family.

Su Yang closed his eyes to ponder for a minute.

Sometime later, he said, "I know you not only give out information but also pass information, so I want you to do something for me."

"You want me to do something for you? I give you an inch and you want to take a mile, huh? Just in case you forgot, I am only telling you about the Su Family because of the information you provided me. It’s not like we’re friends or anything. If you want me to do something for you, you’ll have to pay up." Mu Yuechan said to him.

Su Yang smiled and said, "Of course, I am not asking you to do this for free. I’ll give you another piece of information about Su Yang that I can guarantee is new to you."

"What? You have even more secrets about Su Yang?" Mu Yuechan stared at him with wide eyes, silently wondering to herself where in heaven’s name did he acquire such information.

"Only if you promise me that you’ll help me convey a message to a certain somebody." Su Yang said.

"Who?"

"The Sect Master of the Lonely Fairies’ Refined Palace, Luo Ziyi," he calmly said.

"You want me to convey a message to Luo Ziyi? Are you insane?"

"If you help me, I will tell you about that one time Su Yang almost mistook a..." Su Yang stopped his sentence midway and smiled.

"Actually, forget it. If you don’t want to help me, I will ask someone else for help."

"Thanks for your help." He then stood up and prepared to leave.

"Wait! Sit back down! I never refused to help you!" Mu Yuechan said with a frown on her face.

Su Yang turned to look at her with a profound smile on his face.

Even though he was ’dead’, Mu Yuechan treasured information about him to such an extent. If he could, he’d strip her n.a.k.e.d and reward her at this very moment.

Su Yang returned to his seat a moment later.

"What do you want me to tell her?" Mu Yuechan then asked.

Su Yang took a deep breath and said, "I will see you at the Frozen Azure Cave in three months when the Azure Lotus blooms."

Mu Yuechan raised her eyebrows after hearing this message.

’The Frozen Azure Cave? The Azure Lotus is an extremely rare treasure that only blooms once every 10,000 years, and the last time the Azure Lotus in the Frozen Azure Cave blossomed was 6 thousand years ago, meaning there’s still 4 thousand more years before it returns, so why did he say 3 months?’ Mu Yuechan wondered inwardly.

"Did you get my message, or should I repeat it?" Su Yang asked her.

"I heard it loud and clear," she said.

"Make sure you repeat every single word without missing any, especially the three months part. That’s the most important." Su Yang then said.

"That will depend on the information you provide me. Now tell me about Su Yang’s secret," she said in a calm manner.

"Should we use the Soul Validity Scroll again?"

"There’s no need," she shook her head.

"I can tell whether one’s lying or not even without the Soul Validity Scroll."

Su Yang nodded and suddenly asked, "Do you know of Li Menghua?"

"Li Menghua? That infamous immortal who likes to dress up as a woman to mess with men? What does he have to do with this?" Mu Yuechan asked him.

"Well... When Su Yang was still an ignorant young man, he’d almost been fooled by Li Menghua. Because of that, he’d wasted at least a hundred years studying men and women just to make sure he never makes the same mistake again." Su Yang revealed another one of his secrets that he swore he’d never tell anyone.

"..."

Mu Yuechan’s jaw dropped to the floor after hearing this.
