Somewhere within the crowd of spectators, a beautiful middle-aged woman that somewhat resembled Sun Jingjing stared at the stage with a serious expression.

"As much as I hate to admit it, it seems like her decision to go to the Profound Blossom Sect was the correct one..."

The middle-aged man sitting beside her suddenly spoke, his eyes on Sun Jingjing with a gentle gaze.

"What, you don‚Äôt think so even after seeing her on the stage?" He continued after a moment of silence.

"No, it‚Äôs just that‚Äî"

"The Profound Blossom Sect has secured their 3rd consecutive victory, and Disciple Sun Jingjing will be staying for the fourth round!" Zi Dong suddenly announced.

"That‚Äôs my girl!" The middle-aged man shouted in excitement.

The beautiful woman beside him shook her head and spoke,"...As I was saying, even though she‚Äôs made some achievement for herself, who would be willing to accept a woman from the Profound Blossom Sect?"

"You know how most men think. They only care about maidens who are pure. As for a girl that is no longer pure, especially when they are from the Profound Blossom Sect, I‚Äôm afraid that it‚Äôll be much harder for her to find a partner."

The middle-aged man chuckled and said, "I think you are underestimating us. As long as they have a pretty face and a good body, we will do anything. Sun Jingjing is not only a peerless beauty but also a powerful cultivator now. I doubt she‚Äôll have any of the problems in your mind. In fact, given her personality, I‚Äôm more worried that she won‚Äôt be able to find a quality man out there that suits her taste."

"..."

The middle-aged woman remained silent and continued to focus on the stage.

"Hah! Profound Blossom Art: Falling Petals!"

Many sword lights appeared above Sun Jingjing before raining towards the young man in front of her.

"Burning Cauldron!"

The Burning Lotus Sect disciple created a large cauldron before him to block the sword lights, but alas, it was quickly torn apart, almost as though it was made from paper.

"Ahhh!"

The sword lights that pierced the cauldron continued to bore down on the disciple, making him feel as though his body was being pierced by a dozen swords. If not for the protective barrier, that would‚Äôve definitely been the results.

"I...I surrender."

The Burning Lotus Sect disciple forfeited the match after many minutes of struggling against Sun Jingjing.

"This doesn‚Äôt make any sense..." Huo Yuanjia mumbled with a frown on his face.

‚ÄôThe Profound Blossom Sect is not known for their prowess or techniques, so how are they able to overpower our disciples with such ease? What‚Äôs more, the Profound Blossom Art is only a Mortal-grade technique! It shouldn‚Äôt be able to resist our Earth-grade techniques, much less overwhelm them!‚Äô

It was not just Huo Yuanjia. Everybody that was at the colosseum was dumbfounded by the results, as nobody there had expected the Profound Blossom Sect to win even a single match against the Burning Lotus Sect, much less winning four consecutively.

"Heavens, it seems like we all have profoundly underestimated the Profound Blossom Sect."

"It‚Äôs not that we‚Äôve underestimated them. The Profound Blossom Sect this year is... almost like an entirely different Sect when compared to their previous accomplishments."

"Indeed. The Profound Blossom Sect has always ranked last or bottom. This is the first time that they‚Äôve shown such brilliance."

"I wonder what‚Äôs changed."

"Perhaps what happened with the Million Snakes Sect has something to do with it."

The spectators began looking at the Profound Blossom Sect in a new light. However, there were still people who refused to praise the Profound Blossom Sect.

"The Burning Lotus Sect must be going easy on them. They are in an Alliance, after all."

"I bet you that they are only allowing the Profound Blossom Sect to win so that they can save them some face. In fact, the Burning Lotus Sect has yet to send out their geniuses."

Meanwhile, on the stage, Zi Dong asked Sun Jingjing, "Are you able to continue? Or do you wish to send out another fighter?"

Sun Jingjing pondered for a moment before speaking, "I had enough fun today. I‚Äôll let my fellow sisters take care of the rest."

Although she still had plenty of strength left in her body, Sun Jingjing did not want to hog all of the spotlight for herself and decided to stop there.

"That was amazing, Sister Jingjing! You blew away three of them with ease!"

The disciples immediately praised her.

"Hehe... it was nothing..." Sun Jingjing blushed.

"Anyway, this new technique is amazing. Even though I just fought three people at the Earth Spirit Realm, the Profound Qi in my body barely depleted!" Sun Jingjing looked at Su Yang with an admiring gaze.

However, Su Yang shook his head and said, ÔøΩÔøΩThe technique itself is nothing special. It‚Äôs what‚Äôs fueling your body with strength that really matters."

Hearing his words, Sun Jingjing unconsciously rubbed her stomach, where the main source of their strength came from.

"Honestly, it‚Äôs so powerful that it feels like cheating." Sun Jingjing showed a bitter smile.

Because their overwhelming strength is borrowed from the Yang Qi that is currently residing within their body, they are technically cheating by receiving help from an external source.

"There‚Äôs no need to feel guilty, as this is how true Dual Cultivators fight." Su Yang shook his head. "If you think Dual Cultivation is all about the connection and pleasure and nothing else, you cannot be considered as a real Dual Cultivator. In fact, what you‚Äôve all been doing until today is only the beginning of what Dual Cultivation has to offer."

"Normal Cultivators have their own methods to fight and we have our own ways. This technique is merely one of many techniques that defines what Dual Cultivation truly is."

"Remember. It is called Dual Cultivation for a reason. Even if it may seem like it, you are never truly alone, as that is simply normal cultivation."

‚ÄôEven if it may seem like it, we are never truly alone...‚Äô

Not just the disciples but even Liu Lanzhi silently repeated his words, almost as though they were trying to engrave it into their hearts.
