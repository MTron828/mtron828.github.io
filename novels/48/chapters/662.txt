Chapter 663 - An Incomprehensible Fight

"Y-Y-You! How can you fight in a sword battle with such a vulgar appearance?! Do you have no shame?!" Lian Li pointed at Su Yang and yelled at him with a blushing face, as this is her first time seeing a man revealing more than just their neck and arm skin.

Su Yang turned to look at Lian Li and spoke with a nonchalant expression on his face, "Shame? Why would I feel ashamed of my own body? And if you don’t like it, you can stop looking."

"Tch!" Lian Li sucked her teeth in anger. How could she possibly not watch when she hasn’t understood how his powers worked yet?

"This young man..." Wu Jiang shook his head, but there was no rule stating that one cannot fight while being n.a.k.e.d. Furthermore, he also suspected Su Yang of cheating, so he would actually prefer it if Su Yang fought n.a.k.e.d.

"Anyway, let us continue our sword battle," Su Yang said to Lian Heng, who had been standing there with a dazed look on his face.

"You don’t have to tell me! Heavenly Sword Cleave!"

Lian Heng raised his sword high into the air before cleaving it downwards, looking as though he wanted to split a mountain.

Whoosh!

A massive black light resembling the blade of a sword appeared in the air and fell towards Su Yang, bearing down immense pressure around him, yet he still somehow manages to hold an unimpressed expression on his face.

"When will you learn that your Sword Intent will have no effect on me?" Su Yang shook his head. "You really are a slow learner..."

In just a moment, the black blade reached Su Yang’s shoulders and threatened to slice his body in half. However, for some unknown reason, Wu Jiang did not make even the slightest movement and silently stared at Su Yang with wide eyes, almost as though he was trying to stare a hole into his body.

Clang!

The moment the black blade touched Su Yang’s shoulder, almost like a mirror falling onto the floor, it shattered into many tiny pieces.

"What?! How is this possible?! What kind of trick are you using?!" Lian Heng felt like he was dreaming after witnessing the impossible before his eyes for the third time, even feeling like he was going to go crazy.

’Impossible! I have been watching his every movement, yet there weren’t any suspicious movements from him! He is really just standing there and doing nothing! But that does not explain how he’s able to break Lian Heng’s sword techniques!’ Wu Jiang pondered with a deep frown.

Even with his vast experience as the Sword Saint, he was unable to comprehend the situation before him, and he has never felt so disoriented in his entire life.

’Damn! Just what on earth is he doing?! I am going crazy just trying to figure it out!’ Lian Li felt like pulling on her own hair from the frustration of not being able to understand a single thing, feeling like she was inside a thick fog without any guide.

’I have never seen anything like this before... It feels like Lian Heng’s Sword Intent are withdrawing from Su Yang instead of being destroyed by him, almost like they are afraid of hurting him...’ Wu Jingjing pondered with a curious gaze.

’And what happened to his Sword Qi? How come I can’t feel it like in the past? Is he hiding it on purpose?’

As everyone pondered what had just happened and why Lian Heng’s attacks cannot even reach Su Yang, much less hurt him, Su Yang said to Lian Heng, "I think I have proved my point— that you will never be able to defeat me in your current state."

"Why?! Why can’t my attacks reach you?! Under my authority as the crown prince, I demand you to answer me!" Lian Heng cried out loud, demanding an answer.

However, Su Yang merely shook his head and said, "You won’t understand even if I told you."

"F.u.c.k! I don’t believe that my blade cannot reach you! If Sword Intent does not work, let’s see if you can block my real sword with your body!" Lian Heng roared before rushing at Su Yang with the Black Demon Sword in his grasp.

"Die for me!"

The Black Demon Sword glowed with a dark light before Lian Heng suddenly thrust it at Su Yang’s chest, his aura radiating with killing intent.

Su Yang smiled at this, and right before the Black Demon Sword reached his chest, his arm flickered, catching the black blade with his bare arms.

"What?!"

Lian Heng cried out loud before retreating, but alas, when he tried to pull his sword, he realized that it would not budge even slightly.

The smile on Su Yang’s face suddenly turned into a grin, and a second later, an immense amount of Sword Intent gushed from his body.

"AAAAAAHHHHH!"

Lian Heng screamed in terror as many sword cuts appeared on his body the instant Su Yang released his Sword Intent.

"Your Highness!" Wu Jiang shouted in a terrified voice, yet he did not move from his spot, as everything happened so fast that it was already too late by the time he could react. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Su Yang reclaimed his Sword Intent after releasing it for a brief second, and Lian Heng collapsed onto the floor the next moment with blank eyes and over a hundred sword injuries on his body. However, luckily for him, they were only minor injuries and nothing life-threatening.

When Wu Jiang saw this, he released a deep and long sigh of relief, as he cannot imagine what would happen to the Holy Sword Academy if Su Yang had killed Lian Heng at that moment.

’What powerful Sword Intent...’ Lian Li held a serious frown on her beautiful face after experiencing Su Yang’s Sword Intent that made her heart skip a beat even though she was on the other side of the stage, and she cannot help but wonder what it would feel to face such a powerful Sword Intent head-on.

After a moment of pondering, Lian Li nodded to herself with a resolute expression on her face before jumping onto the stage, dumbfounding everybody there.
