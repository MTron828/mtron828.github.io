Chapter 772 A Quick Detour

Ruan Zongze remained behind for a few extra moments after his wife and Su Yang left the place, and he swept the crowd there with a furious look on his face.

’I will not let this go! Since you dared to step on my dignity as a man, I shall do the same to you! I don’t care if you are Immortal Fairy Su Yue’s husband or not— I will make you pay for humiliating me before so many people today!’ Ruan Zongze cried inwardly.

Once they’d left the Ancestral Pavilion, Ruan Xiao Qing said to Su Yang, "Our family household is in another city a few thousand miles away if you don’t mind."

"I know— I went there first to look for you." Su Yang nodded.

"We have carriages waiting outside. Please follow me." Ruan Xiao Qing said as she led the rest of the Ruan Family with her.

Meanwhile, everybody in the Ruan Family looked at Su Yang with admiration in their gaze, as they couldn’t believe how calm Su Yang was despite being surrounded by them, especially after everything he’s done to their patriarch.

If it were any of them in Su Yang’s shoes right now, they’d be too afraid to even walk properly.

Sometime later, they arrived somewhere outside where a dozen luxurious carriages were stationed.

"You can stay in this one with your companion. We will arrive at the Ruan Family in about a day," said Ruan Xiao Qing with her fingers pointed to one of the carriages.

However, Su Yang shook his head and said, "I can take us back to your house in just a few minutes, but I can only bring one person with me."

He retrieved the wooden flying boat and tossed it on the ground.

"How about it? Your family can return a little later," he said.

Ruan Xiao Qing pondered for a minute before nodding her head, "Very well. Let me talk with the family."

She then went to speak with the Ruan Family.

"What? You’re going to return to the family alone with that man?! Alone?! I won’t allow it!" Ruan Zongze immediately refused.

Ruan Xiao Qing frowned and said to him in a cold voice, "What? Are you really that afraid that he might do something to me? Or are you doubting me, your own wife? Don’t forget that you were the one who married me, not the other way around!"

Ruan Rongze immediately began sweating, as he feared Ruan Xiao Qing when she’s angry.

"I am sorry for doubting you, my wife..." Ruan Zongze spoke in a tamed voice.

"Then I’ll be leaving now. I’ll see you all in a day!" Ruan Xiao Qing said as she turned around and returned to Su Yang.

"Okay, we can leave now."

Su Yang nodded and got onto the flying boat and turned to look at the little girl, "Come over here."

The little girl nodded and calmly entered the boat with him.

Once Ruan Xiao Qing was also on the boat, Su Yang controlled it and disappeared from the place instantly.

"Heavens! What kind of spiritual treasure was that?! I have never seen anything like that before!"

The people from the Ruan Family exclaimed in a shocked voice.

A few minutes later, Su Yang stopped the flying boat.

Ruan Xiao Qing spoke in a slightly trembling voice, "H-Have we arrived?"

"No, not yet."

Ruan Xiao Qing raised her eyebrows. Then why did they stop moving?

"I have to prepare the Immortal-grade techniques first. You think I carry them around like money?" Su Yang said. "So we’re going to take a slight detour."

"Okay..." Ruan Xiao Qing nodded, silently wondering to herself where they’re going to go.

A few moments later, Su Yang descended the flying boat before a massive mansion.

"W-Wait a second... this place is..."

Ruan Xiao Qing’s eyes widened with shock when she saw the Lian Family’s building in front of them. Although she has only been to this place once in her lifetime, she would never forget this familiar presence— the feeling of authority and power!

"T-This is the Lian Family’s household! What the heck are we doing here?!" Ruan Xiao Qing exclaimed in a shocked voice as Su Yang got off the flying boat.

"Just follow me." Su Yang said as he casually approached the building with the little girl following behind him innocently, as she had no idea what kind of place they were at.

"W-Wait a second! We cannot just—"

However, before Ruan Xiao Qing could even finish her sentence, Su Yang opened the door and casually walked inside, acting as though it was his own home.

"Heavens..."

Ruan Xiao Qing swallowed nervously, and she decided to follow him a moment later.

"Hm? You’re back already? Did you get the Dew of Life from the Ruan Family?" Lian Li was the first to greet Su Yang.

"No, I am currently in the process of obtaining it, but it shouldn’t take much longer." Su Yang said.

"Oh? Who’s that following you?" Lian Li looked at the cute little girl standing behind him.

"A little friend I picked up on the way. Anyway, I am going to go write up some cultivation techniques. Can you take care of my guests in the meantime? It’ll only take an hour." Su Yang said.

"Okay." Lian Li nodded. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

"Y-Your Highness!" Ruan Xiao Qing greeted Lian Li when she saw Lian Li after entering the building.

"Oh? Matriarch Ruan?" Lian Li raised her eyebrows. Did Ruan Xiao Qing follow Su Yang all the way here? Why? Does it have something to do with the Dew of Life?

"I’m sorry if I’m intruding, Your Highness, but I am..."

"It’s okay, you don’t have to explain yourself since you’re with Su Yang." Lian Li said to her with a warm smile on her face.

"Uhhh..." Ruan Xiao Qing was dumbfounded by Lian Li’s character, as she felt like an entirely different person for some reason. What happened to the prideful little princess from before? Did something happen to her that caused this drastic change in character?
