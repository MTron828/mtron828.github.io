Chapter 943 Cheating

"This doesn’t count! How can you be so shameless, Xiang’er? You’re an Immortal whilst I am still only at the Sovereign Spirit Realm. No matter how experienced I am, the difference is too big. Let me recover at least half of my strength before you challenge me!" Su Yang said with a bittersweet smile on his face.

And he continued, "And there’s no way I can defeat you in alchemy— not even if I trained under you for another million years."

Yu Xiang then responded with a smile on her face, "No excuses, Su Yang. A defeat is a defeat. If you don’t want to admit defeat, then I will force you to admit defeat!"

She then summoned her alchemy flames and began riding his stiff rod again.

Su Yang’s body trembled with pleasure again, and he said with an adamant smile on his face, "Don’t underestimate me!"

He got up from the bed and pinned Yu Xiang’s beautiful body onto the bed, before using Myriad of Transformations to enlarge his rod and thrusting it inside her body, instantly gaining control of the flow.

Yu Xiang’s body shook with pleasure, and her lower mouth began spraying out Yin Qi when Su Yang continuously poked her weak spot with his enlarged rod.

If it was the other ladies from the other world, they would’ve definitely lost consciousness by now.

However, Yu Xiang was an immortal with incredible endurance levels, especially since she tempered her body with countless precious pills. Although her body was screaming with pleasure and her cave was gushing with Yin Qi, she was nowhere near exhausted or ready to give up.

In fact, Yu Xiang had so much energy that she’d decided to concoct a pill while Su Yang pleasured her body!

After taking out the ingredients from her storage ring, Yu Xiang concocted a couple of pills without needing any cauldron.

A few seconds later, Yu Xiang consumed the pills she’d just freshly concocted.

Su Yang raised his eyebrows when he recognized the pills she consumed.

"That’s definitely cheating."

Su Yang didn’t know whether to laugh or cry after seeing her consume these pills that not only increased her stamina but also improved her endurance.

Furthermore, since they were pills concocted by the God of Alchemy herself, its effects would naturally be much stronger than normal.

"You’re using your dual cultivation skills, yet I cannot use my alchemy skills? You’re the shameless one, Su Yang," she said with a smile.

"I guess I can’t really argue against that..." Su Yang wasn’t the least angry about the situation.

In fact, he has long gotten used to Yu Xiang acting in such a manner, as this was not their first time cultivating with each other.

The two of them continued to cultivate with each other like this for the entire week until Su Yang could no longer physically or mentally continue, and for the first time since his reincarnation, Su Yang had suffered complete defeat by Yu Xiang’s immortal body that was supported by her godlike pills.

Cultivating with Yu Xiang was so exhausting that it couldn’t even compare to when he cultivated with tens of thousands of cultivators without any breaks at the Profound Blossom Sect.

"Okay, I surrender. You win this time, Xiang’er." Su Yang collapsed onto the bed with his body soaked in sweat and Yin Qi.

"However, I will definitely return this favor in the future when I regain my strength— tenfold," he said with a grin on his face.

Yu Xiang laid beside him with her cave flowing with Yang Qi, and she said in a low voice, "I cannot wait."

After resting for a few hours, Yu Xiang suddenly said, "Want to go again?"

"Just a little more, okay?"

"Okay."

Thus, they began cultivating again, and they ended up continuing for another week.

In the end, Su Yang activated the Family Seal on Yu Xiang’s body. As for where the Family Seal appeared— it appeared on her chest.

Once they cleaned up the mess, Su Yang said, "Xiang’er, I have another favor to ask of you."

"What is it?" Yu Xiang asked him as she consumed a pill that transformed her back to her childish body. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

"There are two people within the family that would like to study alchemy under you. Can you teach them for a bit?" Su Yang finally decided to tell her about Wang Shuren and Bai Lihua.

"You want me to accept disciples? You know I don’t like teaching people since it takes away from my time. Of course, you were an exception," she said with a slight frown on her face.

Despite having a sect of her own, Yu Xiang doesn’t actually teach any of the disciples, as that was the sect elders’ responsibility.

In fact, her sect was a one-of-a-kind place where the Sect Master doesn’t really engage with the sect or its disciple. Yu Xiang’s role as a Sect Master was mostly in name with the sect elders doing most of the work.

Despite the lack of involvement from the Sect Master, the sect is still one of the most successful and powerful sects within the Four Divine Heavens simply because of Yu Xiang’s status as the God of Alchemy.

Even if she doesn’t do anything, her name alone could carry an entire sect to the peak of the Four Divine Heavens.

"Of course, that’s why I am only asking you. If you don’t want to teach them, I will try to look for other ways to help them. They’re very passionate about alchemy, after all."

Yu Xiang stared at him in silence for a moment before speaking, "Since I am now part of the family, I should at the very least give them a chance."

And she continued, "I will teach them for one month as a trial, but if they don’t show any promise or waste my time, I will immediately send them away. If you agree to this term, I will teach them."

Su Yang nodded, "I expected you would say something like this. In fact, I even brought them here with me, so you can speak with them yourself."
