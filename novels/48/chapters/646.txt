Chapter 647 - Emperor Lian

"Emperor Lian is a peak Sovereign Spirit Realm expert and also the ruler of the Holy Central Continent, and his Lian Family has been the number one power on the continent since the ancient times," Sect Master Zhu explained.

"Besides a few rules that they have set for the continent, the Lian Family rarely interacts with the outside world, only acting during extreme and urgent situations. However, that is not to say they know nothing about what’s going outside. In fact, it’s the complete opposite. The Lian Family keeps track of everything that happens on the continent."

"So they’re like you guys," Su Yang turned to look at the Xie Family after hearing Sect Master Zhu’s words.

"Eh?" Sect Master Zhu turned to look at the Xie Family before stopping to stare at Xie Wang, and she continued a moment later, "I have been meaning to ask, but who are these people? Although I don’t know every Heavenly Spirit Realm expert on the continent, I know everyone who has reached the Sovereign Spirit Realm, yet I have never seen him before."

"Do you want to introduce yourselves or should I do it for you?" Su Yang asked them.

Lord Xie stood up the next second and gave a courteous bow, "Hello, Senior Zhu. My name is Xie Yimu from the Xie Family, and my family currently governs the Eastern Continent."

"Wait... Eastern Continent? You guys came from the Eastern Continent!?" Sect Master Zhu looked at them with wide eyes.

"That’s right, and we have always wanted to visit the Holy Central Continent, even treating this place as though it’s Cultivators’ heaven," Lord Xie said.

"This is my first time meeting with someone from the Eastern Continent," she spoke in a daze.

However, Su Yang shook his head and said, "What are you talking about? I also came from the Eastern Continent."

"What!? Is that true!?" Sect Master Zhu looked at him with a gawking expression.

Su Yang nodded.

"Unbelievable..." she mumbled.

"Anyway, continuing with the introduction, I am Xie Wang, the Ancestor of the Xie Family and Xie Yimu’s father. It’s nice to meet you, Fellow Daoist."

"I have heard about the low quality of Profound Qi in the Eastern Continent; it’s surprising that someone actually managed to reach the Sovereign Spirit Realm in that place," she said with an interested gaze.

"Hahaha... it took me over a millennium to achieve this cultivation, though..." Xie Wang laughed in a bitter voice.

After the two of them exchanged a few sentences with each other, Xie Xingfang stood up and bowed to her gracefully, "This Junior’s name is Xie Xingfang, and I am the only child in my family. It’s an honor to meet Senior."

’This girl is definitely a beauty behind that veil!’ Sect Master Zhu thought to herself after seeing Xie Xingfang’s perfect figure and noble aura.

She then looked at Su Yang, wondering if Xie Xingfang could be his main lover.

"So... you all came here for the Four Elements Root? If I am not being too nosy, can you tell me why you need this treasure?" Sect Master Zhu asked them sometime later.

"Well, it’s like this..." Xie Wang proceeded to explain the situation and Xie Xingfang’s condition to her.

"A poisoned body? That sounds... very complicated..." Sect Master Zhu spoke with a frown on her face, pitying their situation. "If there’s anything I can do to help, just let me know. Though, I doubt you’ll be needing me for anything with Su Yang here, especially when it comes to Alchemy. He’s definitely the best out there when it comes to Alchemy."

"Wait a second... Alchemy... The best out there?" Lord Xie suddenly frowned upon realizing something.

Su Yang noticed Lord Xie staring at him with wide eyes, seemingly asking him for confirmation. And in response, he merely showed Lord Xie an innocent-looking smile.

’It’s him! It’s definitely him! The mysterious Alchemy Master who showed up out of the blue! Everything makes sense now! An expert from the Holy Central Continent, my ass! It was you all along, Su Yang!’ Lord Xie cried inwardly after realizing the truth to the mysterious Alchemy Master’s identity.

Even Xie Xingfang and Xie Wang were looking at him with dumbfounded expressions, as they have also realized the situation. Though, they were not as surprised as Lord Xie, who had personally spoken with him in his disguise.

"Now you understand why we need the Four Elements Roots. Do you think this Emperor Lian would be willing to give it up?" Su Yang asked a moment later.

"I honestly can’t say for sure, but since you are related to Immortal Fairy Su Yue..." Sect Master Zhu said.

"Immortal Fairy Su Yue..." A slight smile appeared on Su Yang’s face after being reminded of Qiuyue’s little alias.

"Anyway, I will set up an appointment with Emperor Lian for you later," Sect Master Zhu said.

Su Yang nodded, and he spoke, "Now that the other matters are out of the way, let’s talk about Zhu Mengyi. How has she been doing lately?"

"Oh, Zhu Mengyi is doing great! She has never been happier before, especially after giving birth to your daughter a few months ago!" Zhu Mengyi spoke with a bright smile on her face.

"Hm? Your daughter?" The Xie Family immediately turned to look at Su Yang with wide eyes filled with utter disbelief.

"A daughter, huh?" Su Yang did not react with shock or surprise even after hearing that Zhu Mengyi had given birth to his child, only showing a gentle smile on his face.

"She’s also a very healthy child! And she will without a doubt grow up to be as beautiful if not even prettier than her mother in the future, especially since she also has your genes!" Sect Master Zhu nodded her head with pure happiness on her face.

"W-W-Wait a moment... Su Yang... You... You i.m.p.r.e.g.n.a.t.ed—" ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Right as Lord Xie opened his mouth to question Su Yang, the door blasted open, and two beauties rushed into the room with a baby in their grasp.
