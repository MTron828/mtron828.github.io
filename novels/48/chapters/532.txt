Chapter 533 Coming of Age

A few days before the Profound Blossom Sect finished scattering 300 million spirit stones around the Sect, a couple thousand miles away, in the Heavenly Swan Sect, Su Yin approached her Master, Bai Lihua, and said to her, "Master, I will be turning 16 in a few days, and I would like to celebrate my birthday and coming of age with my beloved brother."

"Oh? It feels like only last year when you joined the Heavenly Swan Sect at 10 years of age. To think it‚Äôs already been 6 long years. I can still remember how you dominated the Outer Court right after you joined. Anyway, congratulations on your birthday and becoming an official adult." Bai Lihua said to her.

"Thank you, Sect Master." Su Yin replied with a smile.

"You want to visit the Profound Blossom Sect and Su Yang, right? Although it hasn‚Äôt been long since their disciple examination ended, I want to see their progress, so I shall tag along with you." Bai Lihua said.

Su Yin and Bai Lihua left the Heavenly Swan Sect and began their journey to the Profound Blossom Sect on the same day.

Meanwhile, at the Profound Blossom Sect, after the disciples have scattered all 300 million spirit stones, Liu Lanzhi went to notify Su Yang.

"We have set up all 300 million spirit stones as you‚Äôd requested. You can build the formation whenever. Though, I hope you‚Äôd hurry, as the entire Sect is filled with so many spirit stones that we cannot even walk around without stepping on them." Liu Lanzhi said to him.

"I understand. I appreciate the disciples and your hard work. I will begin building the formation later today after."

"Let me know when you decide to build the formation, since I want to experience for myself how formations are created, as you rarely get to meet Array Masters, much less watch them work."

"Don‚Äôt worry, I will definitely let you know. As a matter of fact, I will let every disciple know."

After Liu Lanzhi left his room, Su Yang went to get Qiuyue.

"The preparations are all complete. Once I create the Grand Formation, I will need you to do the final touches by activating the formation, completing it."

"Even though I am at the Divine Lord Realm, it‚Äôs going to be exhausting to activate a Grand Formation," she said to him with a calm expression, yet the light in her eyes was flicking with anticipation. N√™ww ùíÑhapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(ùíÜ)l/bin(.)com

Su Yang smiled after noticing the hint in her eyes, and he spoke, "Of course, I won‚Äôt ask you to do it for free. What do you want in return?"

"You are not trying to trick me into using the favor you still owe me with this, right?" Qiuyue asked him with a doubtful gaze.

"Hahaha..." Su Yang laughed, and he said, "I wouldn‚Äôt do something like that to you."

Qiuyue nodded, and after standing there to ponder for a few moments, she spoke with a slightly red face, "You are good with your hands, right? I want you to give me a long massage afterward for helping you."

"A massage, huh?" Su Yang expressed surprise after hearing her request, as he truly did not expect it. "Very well. I shall give you a message so good that it will leave an everlasting impression."

"Eh...? You don‚Äôt have to go overboard, you know... Just a normal one is good enough..." It was Qiuyue‚Äôs turn to be surprised, as she did not expect him to take her request so seriously. As a matter of fact, she was afraid of losing control of her own emotions and desire because of the massage.

"There‚Äôs no need to be humble. I will definitely make sure all the stress from activating the Grand Formation will go away after the massage."

"But‚Äî"

Right as Qiuyue opened her mouth, Liu Lanzhi‚Äôs voice resounded from the outside.

"Su Yang! Sect Master Bai Lihua and your sister, Su Yin, are here for you!"

"I will be right there!" Su Yang said.

"Anyway, you can look forward to it." He then said to Qiuyue before leaving her alone.

"Did I dig myself a hole with that request...?ÔøΩÔøΩ she mumbled in a dazed voice after Su Yang disappeared.

Meanwhile, a Sect Elder from the Profound Blossom Sect welcomed Bai Lihua and Su Yin into the Sect.

However, when the two beauties first entered the Sect and saw the spirit stones that littered everywhere on the floor like trash, they were shocked dumb.

"W-What on earth happened here? Why are there so many spirit stones on the ground? Are you by any chance doing a ritual of some sort?" Bai Lihua asked the Sect Elder, who responded with a weird smile on her face, "This is Su Yang‚Äôs idea... He plans on building a formation for the Sect, and this is the preparation for that."

"A formation? The Heavenly Swan Sect also has a formation protecting the Sect, but we didn‚Äôt have to do something like this...?" Bai Lihua said.

Hearing such words, the Sect Elder did not know how to respond and merely shook her head.

As Bai Lihua and Su Yin entered deeper into the Sect and saw even more spirit stones, their shock grew stronger.

‚ÄôGood heavens, how many spirit stones did it cost them to make such a grand scenery?‚Äô Bai Lihua wondered to herself, still unaware of the amount of spirit stones used.

Even though Bai Lihua is the Sect Master of a renowned Elite Sect, she cannot help but have itchy hands after seeing so many spirit stones scattered freely before her, almost as though they were begging for her to take them.

Sometime later, Su Yang appeared before them.

"Elder Brother!" Su Yin‚Äôs face immediately brightened after seeing him.

She wanted to run to his side and embrace him, but alas, there were simply too many spirit stones in the way for her to run anywhere.

Therefore, she could only slowly approach him.

Once Su Yang was within arms reach, Su Yin immediately lunged her body at him followed by a passionate embrace.
