Chapter 821 - I Have Always Paid Attention to You

"Why are you following me? You should stay with your family," Qiuyue said to Su Yang without looking back after leaving the place.

"You’re also part of the family, you know?" Su Yang responded in a calm voice.

"Even though I don’t have your Family Seal? Even though we’ve never cultivated before?" Qiuyue asked him after she stopped in some courtyard filled with flowers.

"You know, it doesn’t require one to cultivate with me to be considered family. When I was still in the Divine Heavens, I had a partner who I considered family despite not laying a single finger on her for over a thousand years," Su Yang suddenly said.

"A thousand years? I don’t believe someone like you can keep your hands off a woman for that long." Qiuyue turned around and looked at Su Yang with a nonchalant gaze, yet her heart was beating crazily.

Su Yang chuckled and said, "I swear. That girl... She was cultivating a unique cultivation technique that had a special condition— that she cannot touch men. If any men had touched her skin even slightly, her entire cultivation base would collapse, forcing her to restart from the beginning. Therefore, I could only wait until she mastered the cultivation technique, which allowed her to finally touch men without any problems, and that took a thousand years. Of course, it was worth waiting for, and I would’ve waited for her even if I had to wait for ten... even a hundred thousand years."

Su Yang approached Qiuyue, who quickly turned around again.

Once Su Yang was standing directly behind her, he spread his arms and hugged her tender body from behind.

Albeit surprised, Qiuyue did not try to run away, nor did she put up the slightest resistance, allowing Su Yang to hug her.

After a long moment of silence, Su Yang spoke, "I wanted to let you approach me whenever you’re comfortable, but it looks like I have to be on the aggressive side, huh? You know, Yuehai... Your mother was always the aggressive one, so I thought you would be somewhat similar."

Qiuyue’s body trembled slightly after hearing his words, and she mumbled, "My mother... she was the aggressive type?"

"Yes. In fact, she was the one who approached me first. If she never approached me, I would’ve probably left the Sacred Moon Palace without any intimate connections with her, which resulted in her death..."

"..."

Qiuyue was left speechless after learning this new information regarding her mother’s relationship with Su Yang. Since Su Yang has always been the aggressive one, she could’ve never expected that it was the opposite for her mother.

"Qiuyue... If you want, let’s cultivate later." Su Yang suddenly said, startling her. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

"C-Cultivate? Have you forgotten? You know we can’t do that! The curse within my bloodline does not allow it!" Qiuyue quickly said.

"Yes, we can’t do it from the front, but if what Lingxi told me is true, then we can do it from the back."

"T-The back..." Qiuyue swallowed nervously, and she recalled the flaw in her bloodline, which required her to take it in the butt if she wanted to cultivate with Su Yang. Just remembering this caused her heart to begin racing.

"Trust me, Qiuyue, it’s not as weird as you think, so there’s no need to feel embarrassed. And until we deal with the curse, there’s really no other choice but to do it from behind. I don’t mind waiting until then before we continue our relationship, but I don’t want you to feel left out or like I don’t care about you because I’m not giving you any attention."

"Do you remember what you did when I first visited the Holy Central Continent? Your aggressiveness... What’s stopping you from doing that again?"

Qiuyue gritted her teeth in frustration— but she was not frustrated at Su Yang. Instead, she was frustrated by her own cowardness.

After taking a deep breath, Qiuyue took a step forward and walked away from Su Yang’s embrace.

She then turned around to stare at Su Yang directly in the eyes with a serious look on her face, almost like she was preparing for war or something.

Su Yang did not say anything and patiently waited for Qiuyue.

A few seconds later, Qiuyue took another step forward, standing directly in front of Su Yang. However, she didn’t stop there and raise both her hands until they were both touching Su Yang’s cheeks.

"Father... No, Su Yang..." Qiuyue proceeded to pull Su Yang’s head towards her own, and a moment later, their lips connected.

"Mmm..."

After a brief moment of kissing, Qiuyue released his head and prepared to step back.

However, Su Yang suddenly embraced her as she tried to leave and began kissing her even more.

Of course, Qiuyue could easily break away from Su Yang with her cultivation, but her body felt powerless at this moment as Su Yang continued to suck her saliva through her soft lips.

After kissing each other for a couple of moments, Qiuyue also embraced Su Yang back and returned his kisses but even more aggressively, almost like all of the feelings she had been holding back for the last few months have suddenly poured forward.

Many minutes later, their lips finally separated from each other, and Qiuyue panted heavily afterward, her face flushed with redness.

"Does this mean you want to cultivate with me?" Su Yang licked his lips before asking her with a gentle smile on his face.

"..."

"..."

"..."

After a few seconds of stillness from Qiuyue, she finally moved, nodding her head in a bashful manner.

"I want to cultivate with you, Su Yang. I want you to start paying attention to me!" she said afterward.

Su Yang then said, "Silly girl, I have always paid attention to you— even before meeting you again in this world. I have been paying attention to you ever since I carried you in my arms for the first time right after Yuehai gave birth to you. I still remember it like it was yesterday; it was just the three of us in the room, almost like we were a real family."
