Chapter 768 Public Bathhouse

Hearing the guard’s words, Su Yang asked, "Where’s the Ancestral Pavilion? If you don’t mind, can one of you take me there?"

Su Yang retrieved a handful of spirit stones and showed it to the guards there.

*Gulp*

The guards swallowed nervously when they saw the spirit stones, and they turned to look at each other with weird looks on their faces.

"I’ll take you there, Young Master!"

"No! Let me take you there, my little ancestor!"

"Please! I am extremely tight on money right now! I really need those spirit stones!"

"I also need to feed my family!"

The guards quickly began fighting over each other for the opportunity to earn so many spirit stones in such an easy manner. Hell, Su Yang’s request was so easy and simple to achieve that he was practically giving them free money!

However, while the guards fought each other, someone approached Su Yang from behind and tugged his robes.

"Hmm?"

Su Yang turned around to see a little girl who seemed to be only around 10 years old grasping his robes, and she was wearing ragged clothes and holding a dirty cup in her hands.

"Big brother, I can bring you to the Ancestral Pavilion, and I will only accept one of those spirit stones from you," she said to him with a pleading gaze.

"Eh?"

The guards immediately stopped fighting when they saw this, and they even felt a little shameful a few moments later.

"Okay. If you can bring me to the Ancestral Pavilion, I will give you a spirit stone." Su Yang nodded at the little girl with a handsome smile on his face.

He then turned to look at the guards and said, "As you can see, I already have someone helping me. However, since you guys were so eager to help me, I’ll give you these. Make sure to share them evenly with each other."

Su Yang tossed the spirit stones at them, and the guards immediately went to catch them.

"Let’s go, little girl." Su Yang said to her.

The little girl nodded and began leading him into the city.

However, before they could walk very far, Su Yang said to her, "Why don’t we take a small detour? I am someone who likes cleanliness, and when I see a girl— no matter who they are— in such a rough appearance, my heart becomes uncomfortable."

The little girl looked at her own appearance before lowering her head in a dejected manner, "I am sorry, big brother, but I don’t have anything else..."

"I know, that’s why we are going to take a detour. Do you know any places where you can clean your body?" Su Yang asked her.

The little girl nodded and said, "There’s a public bathhouse not too far away." Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

"Good, then let’s go there now."

"But I need money to go there and I don’t have any," she continued.

"Don’t worry, I’ll pay for it."

The little girl nodded again and changed directions.

A few minutes later, they arrive at this building that emitted a fragrance smell the moment they approached it.

Once they were at the counter, Su Yang placed a single spirit stone on the table before the worker there and said, "Clean this little girl here and you can have the entire thing."

The young lady working behind the desk immediately widened her eyes when she saw the spirit stone that was worth more than ten years of her pay.

"I-I get to keep this spirit stone? Really?" The young lady asked him in a doubtful voice, as it sounded too good to be true.

"You can keep it in your pockets while you clean her if you’d like," Su Yang said to her.

"Thank you very much, Young Master!" The young lady looked around to make sure nobody was watching before she quickly stored the spirit stone in her pockets.

"Do you have any clean clothes for her?" The young lady then asked him. "If we put these clothes back on her afterward, it would make cleaning her pointless..."

"I will bring back something by the time you’re done," Su Yang said to her.

"Okay." The young lady nodded.

"Come with me, I’ll make you clean again." The young lady then brought the little girl into the back and began cleaning her.

Meanwhile, Su Yang went outside to buy some new clothes for the little girl.

Inside the shower, the young lady asked the little girl.

"What’s your relationship with that handsome young man?" she couldn’t help but be curious about their relationship.

"I don’t know him," the little girl responded.

"Eh? You don’t know each other? Then why is he helping you? And why are you following him? He may look like a noble gentleman on the outside, but one’s appearance can be very deceiving... Who knows, he might even be a pervert who’s only cleaning you so he can eat you afterward!" The young lady exclaimed in a shocked voice.

"Eat me? Why would big brother eat me? I am not tasty..." The little girl asked in an innocent voice.

"Uhh... then what are you doing with him?" The young lady decided to ask her.

The little girl then explained the situation to the young lady cleaning her, clearing up some misunderstandings.

"The Ancestral Pavilion? Only the wealthiest people go there! As expected of someone who can afford to give away a spirit stone for something so simple without batting an eye!" The young lady then sighed, "Haaa... If only I had a husband as wealthy and handsome as that young man..."

Sometime later, the young lady finished cleaning the little girl, and she went outside to look for Su Yang for the clothes.

Once Su Yang handed her the clothes he’d just bought, she went back inside to dress up the little girl.

A few more minutes later, the little girl returned with the young lady.

When Su Yang saw the little girl’s new appearance, he nodded with a smile on his face, "As expected, you look much better like that— almost like a young lady from some powerful family."
