Chapter 599 Urges to Just Go Wild

"Ahhh~"

"Ahhhhh~!"

"Ahhh~!"

"More! Fill my body with more of your Yang Qi!"

Liu Lanzhi moaned loudly as Su Yang passionately pounded her body.

A few moments later, hot Yang Qi rushed into her tight cave, filling her stomach until she felt full, feeling as though she just ate a large meal.

"Let me clean it up for you," Liu Lanzhi said to him afterward.

"Mmm..." She gently licked around his thick shaft with her soft tongue before sticking it inside her mouth.

"Mmm~"

"Mmmmm..."

Liu Lanzhi continued to suck on his rod despite already licking it clean, looking as though she was addicted to it.

"You should have more inside you, right? Go ahead and shoot it inside my mouth. I‚Äôll swallow everything you have to offer!" Liu Lanzhi suddenly said to him.

Su Yang nodded with a slight smile on his face, and a few minutes later, another load of Yang Qi rushed out of his shaft, quickly filling Liu LanzhiÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩs mouth.

"Mmmm!"

Liu Lanzhi‚Äôs eyes widened with surprise by the seemingly endless supply of Yang Qi flowing into her mouth, and she hastily swallowed the Yang Qi so that she could fit more in her mouth.

Many mouthfuls later, Su Yang stopped releasing his Yang Qi, allowing Liu Lanzhi to finally breathe. Th.√™ most uptodatùìÆ nùíêvels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

"Were you trying to choke me to death with your Yang Qi?" Liu Lanzhi said to him afterward.

"I couldn‚Äôt help it, your mouth just felt that amazing." Su Yang shrugged with an innocent-looking expression.

"Really?" Liu Lanzhi asked him with her eyes flickering with joy.

"Yes, really. Compared to our first session together, you have improved significantly. Even you wouldn‚Äôt recognize yourself if you could travel to the past and witness the difference." He nodded.

"I guess having a competent partner makes a world of difference," she said, and then she continued with a bittersweet smile. "I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll get by without you in the future, Su Yang. After doing it so many times with you, my standards for pleasure have become somewhat unrealistic, and I won‚Äôt be satisfied with just anybody now. How are you going to take responsibility for this, Su Yang?"

"When you‚Äôve become so good at something that it‚Äôs easier to improve than to hold back your abilities, there‚Äôs really nothing you can really do." Su Yang sighed. "It may not seem like it, but it‚Äôs actually incredibly difficult for me to hold back so much of my abilities. There were plenty of times during my cultivation in this world that I felt this uncontrollable urge to just go wild."

Liu Lanzhi looked at Su Yang with wide eyes, as she cannot imagine just how much of his real abilities are actually being suppressed or what it would feel like to cultivate with Su Yang when he‚Äôs using all of his abilities and techniques.

"I‚Äôm sorry, Su Yang. I knew you were holding back your abilities, but I didn‚Äôt know it would be this extent." Liu Lanzhi sighed.

"Don‚Äôt worry about it, I‚Äôm used to it by now." Su Yang said with a smile.

Sometime later, Liu Lanzhi asked him, "How are the disciples doing?"

"They are all improving at a very good pace. It shouldn‚Äôt take long before they are all at the Earth Spirit Realm. Some of them might even reach that level by the end of the year." Su Yang said to her.

"Earth Spirit Realm..." A weird expression appeared on Liu Lanzhi‚Äôs face. "Not long ago, I would‚Äôve been ecstatic if even a single disciple managed to enter the True Spirit Realm. It just feels like the world is spinning too fast."

"The Cultivation world is ever-improving, and it will remain that way even if I was not here. I am merely assisting by speeding up that process."

"I feel kind of guilty for letting you do everything by yourself, Su Yang. Even though I am also a Sect Master, I have been doing nothing else besides selfishly improving my own cultivation base while letting you take care of the disciples." Liu Lanzhi sighed.

"If you don‚Äôt quickly improve your cultivation, what do you think will happen once I am gone? Who will take care of the disciples? Although there‚Äôs still the Grand Formation protecting the Sect, there‚Äôs only so much it can do. And once I leave this place, you‚Äôll have to take care of the disciples by yourself until you find another Sect Master."

"I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to find another Sect Master who can fit those shoes as perfectly as you, Su Yang."

"Have faith in the disciples. Although they may be immature right now, once they finish their training, there will be plenty of competent disciples that can become a capable Sect Master."

"Of course. They are taught by an Immortal, after all." Liu Lanzhi said with a smile.

Sometime later, Su Yang returned to his own room, where Tang Lingxi was silently cultivating on his bed.

"As expected of the Sect Master of an entire Sect ‚Äî you work very hard for the disciples." Tang Lingxi suddenly said to him.

"You‚Äôre still awake? Were you waiting for me?" Su Yang asked her.

"Yes, I have something to talk to you about; it‚Äôs regarding Qiuyue," she said with a calm voice.

"Qiuyue? What about her?"

"How do you really feel about her? As a woman, I mean."

"I love her, of course." He responded without hesitation.

"I figured you would say that." Tang Lingxi nodded, and she continued to question him, "Then how much do you know about her bloodline? You stayed in the Sacred Moon Palace for some time, right? Surely, you must know a few things about them."

"The Sacred Moon Palace? Why do you ask?" Su Yang raised his eyebrows in a puzzled manner.

"I‚Äôm just wondering why you didn‚Äôt tell Qiuyue about the loophole for the curse. I don‚Äôt doubt your feelings for her, but knowing you, you would‚Äôve told her about it long ago so that she won‚Äôt feel as hopeless. Even if she did not like that idea, at least you‚Äôve given her a choice." Tang Lingxi said to him.

"..."

Su Yang did not immediately respond and remained silent for a long moment.
