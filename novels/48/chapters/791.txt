Chapter 792 - In Three Days

"Even if I take the Root of Revival by force, there’s nothing the Nine Immortal Families can do about it," Xian Ni spoke with a grin on his face. "Am I right?"

Senior Cang’s back was quickly soaked in cold sweats after hearing Xian Ni’s words, and he said in a trembling voice, "Indeed, there’s nothing we can do if you really decide to take the Root of Revival by force, but I don’t believe you will do such a thing, Ancestor Xian."

"Hoh? You seem to know me very well. How confident are you in your own words, though?" Xian Ni said.

"I’ve known you since I was a young man. I know that you can be cold and aggressive at times, but you’re actually very caring and gentle. I also know that you wouldn’t do anything to lower the Xian Family’s reputation." Senior Cang said with a serious look on his face.

Xian Ni narrowed his eyes at Senior Cang, yet he didn’t say anything, almost like he was speechless.

"Since it has come to this, it appears that I have no other choice but to participate in this tournament and get the Root of Revival that way. I have a week to spare before I return to the Northern Continent so I can spare some time here," Su Yang suddenly said.

"Y-You’ll be participating in the tournament? But only those who are younger than 50 years old may participate in the tournament!" Xian Ni said to him, believing that Su Yang was much older than he appeared.

"Is that the only requirement for me to participate? If that’s the case, there’ll be no problems." Su Yang said.

"The age requirement is just one of few requirements. You must also belong to an elite sect or a powerful faction, or you must have a recommendation from one of the Nine Immortal Families or the Xian Family." Senior Cang added. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Su Yang turned to look at Xian Ni and said, "You can recommend me, right?"

"O-Of course... If you really intend on participating in the tournament." Xian Ni nodded in a dazed manner.

"Don’t worry, I don’t plan on spending very much time in this tournament," Su Yang said with a mysterious smile on his face.

"Then it’s settled. In three days, we’ll be at the tournament." Xian Ni said.

Sometime later, Su Yang and the others left the Immortal Association.

"You... How old are you exactly?" Xian Ni asked Su Yang afterward.

"My physical body is only 18 years old," Su Yang said in a calm voice.

"WHAT?! THAT’S IMPOSSIBLE!" Xian Ni exclaimed in the air, and he stopped flying to stare at Su Yang with a shocked look on his face.

"How could you possibly train your body to such a level in 18 short years?! It had taken me hundreds of years to reach my level!" Xian Ni said.

"Don’t compare me to you, old man." Su Yang said with a smile on his face. "You’re looking at a real Immortal here, after all."

"What? A real Immortal? But you just claimed to be 18 years old. How can you be an Immortal at 18 years old?"

Su Yang then said, "Because I am someone who has experienced reincarnation, and in my previous life, I was an Immortal."

"You..." Xian Ni was speechless.

Even if Su Yang was telling the truth, why would he reveal something so shocking to him when they’ve only just met? Is Su Yang that confident that it wouldn’t affect him even if he told everybody?

"No wonder why you claimed that resurrection was impossible yet you sounded quite confident that reincarnation was real..." Xian Ni said.

"Anyway, we can slowly talk about this once we’ve settled down somewhere more private and peaceful. Follow me, I’ll bring you to my little paradise." Xian Ni said, and he proceeded to lead Su Yang and the others a couple of thousand miles away from Immortal City.

Sometime later, they arrived at this secluded area, where a beautiful pond with clear water and a small pavilion existed.

"This is where I usually come to relax. It’s within the Xian Family’s territory so you don’t have to worry about unwanted guests." Xian Ni said to them.

"Thank you." Su Yang said as he took a seat in the pavilion.

"I’ll be cultivating beside the pond. Call me if you need me," Lian Li said as he sat in front of the pond that was emitting powerful spiritual energy and began cultivating.

"You’re really lucky to have such a beautiful woman as your partner." Xian Ni said to him in an envious tone.

"Thank you," Su Yang said with a smile on his face.

"Anyway, can you tell me more about your Immortal background? I’m actually very interested in an Immortal’s lifestyle." Xian Ni said as he retrieved a teapot and three teacups. One for Su Yang, one for himself, and the final one for Xiao Rong, who was standing beside Su Yang like some kind of bodyguard.

"Two teacups is enough— she doesn’t drink tea." Su Yang said.

Xian Ni nodded and took back one of the teacups.

"Xiao Rong, why don’t you take a nap? We won’t be going anywhere for the next three days," Su Yang said to her.

Xiao Rong nodded, and she transformed to her beast form before curling into a ball on Su Yang’s lap, shocking Xian Ni.

"T-T-This is?! She was a magical beast this entire time?!" Xian Ni nearly dropped the teapot when he saw that.

"What? You’ve never seen a magical beast turn into a human before?" Su Yang asked him.

"I-I have... but they didn’t look as perfect and you can tell right away that they are not truly human," Xian Ni said with a dazed look on his face.

"Is that so?" Su Yang said as he sipped on the tea that Xian Ni had just poured him.

A moment later, Su Yang spoke, "So you believe me when I say that I am an Immortal who experienced reincarnation?"

Xian Ni nodded and responded, "Even if I don’t want to believe it, there’s no other logical reason why someone so young would be so powerful."
