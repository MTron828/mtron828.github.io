Chapter 570 Everlasting Time Pill

"W-W-What do you mean only ten hours have passed...?" Wang Shuren asked him in a dumbfounded voice.

"The pill I made you experience is called the Everlasting Time Pill. Anyone affected by the pill will be entrapped within their own consciousness while feeling as though they are still in reality. It’s akin to having a really long dream, but your mind is awake the entire time. From where I am from, the Everlasting Time Pill is commonly used on prisoners as a form of punishment. Of course, there are other uses as well, such as testing the mental fortitude of an individual." Su Yang explained to her.

"So... while you may have lived for a hundred years inside your mind, in reality, only ten hours have passed since the beginning."

After a long moment of silence, Wang Shuren mumbled in a low voice, "Then... all of my achievements... were just in my head — a mere dream? I did not really live a hundred years? And all the effort I’d put into reaching the Heavenly Spirit Realm... was all fake?"

Once she realized the truth, tears began flowing down her face, and she spoke in a trembling voice, "Even though it was just a test, this was very cruel of you, Su Yang... What did I do to deserve this?"

Seeing her reaction and watching tears flow down her beautiful face, Su Yang felt a little bit guilty for testing her. However, it was not as though he wanted to punish her or make her cry.

"I’m sorry for making you endure such a trial without any warning, but I truly believed that you’d benefit greatly from it. If you’d known about it in advance, then it would’ve been pointless."

"What do you mean I have benefited from this...?" Wang Shuren slowly wiped her tears and asked him.

"Although what you have experienced in your mind was fake, it is also real simultaneously," he said to her.

"Go ahead and try to cultivate."

"Right now?"

Seeing Su Yang nod his head, Wang Shuren immediately began cultivating, and to her surprise, it was much easier and natural than before, almost as though she’d been doing this for many decades.

"Because of the Everlasting Time Pill, your mental strength has increased tremendously, and the time you’d spent cultivating inside your mind, all of that experience you’d gathered during that time is real. Therefore, you’ve essentially lived for 100 years in the last ten hours, but your physical body remains unchanged."

"Eh?! Won’t that make the Everlasting Time Pill an incredibly powerful and priceless treasure?!" Wang Shuren expressed shock.

"Depending on how you use it, yes, it can become a powerful treasure for training others. However, most of the time, that is not the case, because only extremely skillful Alchemists are able to concoct Everlasting Time Pills that will have an effect of over a hundred years. In fact, most Alchemists would only be able to make the pill last for a few years at most. Furthermore, you cannot consume this pill very often, or it’ll greatly burden your mind, even breaking it at times."

"The most one can consume the Everlasting Time Pill is once every one thousand years. Therefore, it’s mostly used to torture the minds of criminals from where I’m from."

Wang Shuren stared at him with wide eyes, and she spoke with an admiring tone, "I knew you were someone impressive, but to think you would be this crazy!"

Su Yang laughed at her words and said, "That’s only natural, as I was personally trained by the Alchemy God. However, compared to the Alchemy God, my skills are still too green. For example, I can create 10,000 Years Everlasting Time Pills at most, whilst the Alchemy God can concoct 100,000 Years Everlasting Time Pills."

"100,000 Years Everlasting Time Pill?! Does this mean you would live for 100,000 years inside your mind?! Did you consume such a pill in your previous life by any chance?!" Wang Shuren’s eyes widened with disbelief.

Su Yang nodded. "In fact, I have consumed a few of them before."

Wang Shuren stared at him silently for a good minute before asking him in a low voice, "How old are you, exactly?"

"Asking Immortals with a young appearance about their real age is akin to asking any woman about their age; it’s quite impolite." Su Yang responded with a smile.

Wang Shuren was speechless. Do Immortals really find that kind of thing disrespectful?

"Anyway, do you have any more questions regarding the Everlasting Time Pill?"

"Well... it’s not exactly about the pill itself, but it’s definitely Alchemy related..." she spoke with a hesitant gaze.

"What is it?"

"If I followed you back to your world... Do you think I would be able to meet this Alchemy God someday? If this person claims to be the Alchemy God, he must be the best Alchemy Master in the world, right? I would like to see for myself just what the peak of Alchemy looks like for once before I die..."

Su Yang looked at her with a surprised face, before laughing out loud a moment later, "Hahaha... if you so desperately want to meet the Alchemy God that you’d be willing to leave this world, then I am willing to personally set up a meeting for you! And just so you know, the Alchemy God is not a ’he’ but a ’she’."

"What?!" Wang Shuren explained loudly, her expression filled with shock.

"The Alchemy God is a woman?!"

Su Yang nodded with a smile and said, "Not only is she a woman, but she’s also an incredibly beautiful one at that."

"A-Are you... and the Alchemy God... by any chance..." Wang Shuren asked him in a trembling voice.

A mysterious smile appeared on Su Yang’s face, and she responded in a calm voice, "Who knows. If you are that interested, you should ask the Alchemy God about it yourself."

"I-I wouldn’t dare..." she quickly shook her head, causing Su Yang to burst out laughing at her response.

"Well, you still have two years to decide whether you truly want to follow me or remain in this world. If you decide to follow me, you will not only be able to concoct pills you’ve never even heard of before but you’ll also experience a whole new world of Alchemy."

Wang Shuren swallowed nervously, feeling extremely tempted by his words.

"I will let you know when I have come to a decision," she said to him.

Sometime later, Su Yang began training Wang Shuren again.

However, because it has been over a hundred years since she last experienced pill making, Wang Shuren’s movements were awkward and stiff.

With that being said, because of the Everlasting Time Pill, her mental strength has increased significantly, allowing her to relearn everything at an extreme rate, even surpassing her old self just a few days later.

"What do you think? Are you still angry at me for testing you?" Su Yang asked her with a smile on his face afterward.

"Do you even need to ask that question? Even though it was cruel of you to make me experience 100 years of solitude, I understand why you did it. I was feeling more disheartened than angry that my 100 years of effort had turned out to be a mere dream. However, after seeing the benefits, I am beginning to feel grateful instead. It’s almost like I’ve been reborn with better talent than previously. Perhaps my efforts weren’t wasted, after all." Wang Shuren spoke as she stared at her hands with a dazed gaze and a gentle smile on her face.

"That’s good to hear. And now that you are comfortable with Alchemy again, it’s time to resume your special training." Su Yang said.

Wang Shuren looked at him with a puzzled expression for a moment before she finally recalled what this ’special training’ was.

"Even though it hasn’t been that long in reality, I feel like it has been forever since you last touched my body." Wang Shuren spoke before loosening her robes.

"As an apology for making you go through that experience, I’ll satisfy your body with 100 years worth of pleasure." Su Yang said, before retrieving a bed from his storage ring and tossing it on the floor.

"O-One hundred years worth of pleasure...? I-I will die from that!" Wang Shuren exclaimed with a terrified expression.

"Hahaha... don’t worry, your mental strength has increased enough to endure it."

A few moments later, Su Yang enveloped Wang Shuren in his embrace and began pounding his shaft into her body, causing her large and perky mountains to jiggle vigorously. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

"Ahhhhn!"

After experiencing 100 years without feeling any pleasure, Wang Shuren’s body trembled with delight she has never felt before, almost as though her body was deprived of pleasure, and her lower lips continuously gushed with Yin Qi as a response, letting Su Yang know of her satisfaction.

"Mmmm~!"

"Ahhhn!"

"Ooooh~!"

And for the entire week, Su Yang and Wang Shuren passionately cultivated with each other in the pill room, relieving Wang Shuren of all her stress from her 100 years of solitude and loneliness.
