Chapter 866 - Saying Their Goodbyes (2)

After returning to the Profound Blossom Sect, Zhu Mengyi, Wu Jingjing, and Lian Li entered the Spatial Device and proceeded to spend the next few days inside.

"Su Yang, are you ready to go to Snowfall City?" Xie Xingfang asked him after he returned.

"Yes. We can go right now." Su Yang nodded.

Sometime later, Su Yang took Xie Xingfang to see her family so she could say her goodbyes.

"So it’s finally time for you guys to leave, huh..." Lord Xie and Xie Wang looked at them with reluctant smiles on their faces.

"Yes... I am here to say my final goodbyes." Xie Xingfang nodded.

And she continued, "I would like to start by thanking you for taking care of me. Thank you, father. Thank you, grandfather."

"You don’t have to thank me. I was merely doing my job as your father." Lord Xie shook his head.

"Xing’er, to tell you the truth, I expected to die with you and your family by my side, but alas... Who could’ve imagined that you would be leaving this world before I do..." Xie Wang sighed.

"Father... grandfather..." Xie Xingfang felt an urge to cry, but she held it back.

"Save your energy and breath, Xing’er. We have already prepared ourselves for this day long ago. You don’t have to say anything to us." Lord Xie said to her with a resolute expression on his stern-looking face.

He then turned to look at Su Yang and said, "Please, take care of my daughter, Su Yang."

"Of course." Su Yang immediately nodded.

Xie Wang then stepped forward and handed a storage ring to Xie Xingfang and said, "There’s really nothing I can give you that Su Yang cannot, so don’t expect anything valuable inside. It’s just some things for you to remember us with."

"I don’t need something to remember my own family..." Xie Xingfang wanted to refuse the gift.

However, Xie Wang shook his head and said, "I didn’t mean it like that. Just take it with you. If you ever have the time, take a look inside."

"I...I understand." Xie Xingfang nodded.

Sometime later, Xie Xingfang sat down with her family and spoke about random things they did previously.

A couple of hours later, Su Yang handed a storage ring to Lord Xie and said, "Inside that storage ring has the method of restoring the Celestial Pond alongside other things that you might find useful."

"You..." Lord Xie looked at him with wide eyes.

"I’m going to tell you what you told Xing’er— don’t waste your breath thanking me. I am only doing what I want." Su Yang said.

After a moment of silence, Lord Xie nodded his head with a serious look on his face.

He then extended his hand, seemingly asking for a handshake.

Su Yang smiled before shaking his hand firmly.

"I will entrust my daughter to you, Su Yang."

Su Yang silently nodded.

"Good luck in your own world, Su Yang." Xie Wang shook his hand next.

"Luck won’t do me any good there." Su Yang said with a smile on his face.

Sometime later, Su Yang left Snowfall City with Xie Xingfang and brought her back to the Profound Blossom Sect, where she entered the Spatial Device with the other three.

"Su Yang, my grandfather would like to speak with us." Sun Jingjing approached him shortly after he returned to the sect.

"Okay. When does he want to speak with us?"

"Whenever you’re available," she said.

"I can go now. What about you?" Su Yang asked her.

"I can as well." L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

"Then let’s go now."

Sun Jingjing nodded, and they proceeded to make their way towards Elder Sun’s living quarters.

"Please, sit down." Elder Sun pointed to the couch in front of them.

Once they were seated, Elder Sun continued, "It’s been a while since we last spoke like this."

"Indeed. The last time the three of us spoke like this, I was still a mere disciple." Su Yang said with a smile on his face.

Elder Sun laughed out loud and said, "Yes, and I remember the first time I met you, Su Yang. You and another disciple were engaged in a deathmatch— one that nobody had authorized, and you ended up with a sword in her c.h.e.s.t, nearly dying on the stage."

And he continued, "You were only at the Elementary Spirit Realm and an Outer Court disciple at that time. But look at you now... The Sect Master of the Profound Blossom Sect and also a prominent expert who has reached the Sovereign Spirit Realm at such a young age. How time has passed so quickly."

After a moment of silence, Elder Sun said, "The reason I called you two here is quite simple— I wanted to give you my blessing before you leave this world."

"Jingjing, you have grown up tremendously ever since you met Su Yang. Although you can still act childish at times, it’s not the same as before. I don’t have to worry as much if you’re going to leave in your current state."

He then turned to look at Su Yang and said, "Ever since you came to this world, you’ve drastically influenced everyone around you— myself included, and I cannot thank you enough for everything you have done for the Profound Blossom Sect and my granddaughter. If it’s you, I know I can rest assured that Sun Jingjing will live a happy life."

"Grandfather..." Sun Jingjing wasn’t someone who’d easily get emotional, but hearing Elder Sun’s words and knowing that she will no longer be able to see him for a long time— perhaps even forever, she couldn’t help but tear up.

And she suddenly asked, "Grandfather, why don’t you come with us?"

However, Elder Sun shook his head and said, "I knew you’d say something like that, but alas, I have dedicated most of my life to the Profound Blossom Sect, and I intend on doing so until my last breath, so I cannot follow you as much as I want to. I’m sorry, Jingjing."
