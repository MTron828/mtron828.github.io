Chapter 678 - Proving Her Sincerity

"..."

Lian Li silently stared at Su Yang with a nervous frown on her beautiful face whilst her body was slightly shaking, as she could’ve never imagined that she would one day plead another man to pleasure her— one who she poisoned and hated not long ago.

Su Yang spoke after a moment of silence, "Follow me."

He then led Lian Li into another room before sitting down on the bed.

"I know I told you to find me, but why should I please someone who poisoned me? If it was a year ago, I wouldn’t have even considered talking to you like this after what you did to me, much less cultivate with you. I guess I have gotten pretty easygoing after spending some time in this ’peaceful’ world."

Hearing his words, Lian Li immediately dropped to her knees and kowtowed to someone who was not her father for the first time in her life, "I am really sorry for trying to poison you! I truly didn’t mean any serious harm to you, as I only wanted to see you being humiliated after what happened to me! Do you have any idea how it feels when people are calling you vulgar nicknames behind your back such as ’Princess Piss Herself’ or Silver River Princess’?! I have never felt such humiliation since birth!"

"Hm..." Su Yang then said, "Since I am partially to blame for scaring you to the point of pissing yourself, if you’re truly sorry for poisoning me, I’ll give you a chance to prove your sincerity."

"Prove... my sincerity?" Lian Li lifted her head to see Su Yang’s legs spread wide open and his intent clear.

Lian Li swallowed nervously, but since she’d already prepared herself for this before even coming here, she did not complain and crawled to him.

Once she was before his pelvis area, she loosened the lower part of his robes and gasped in shock at the profound dragon that was nearly poking her face. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

’This is much larger than the bulge I saw before!’ Lian Li cried inwardly.

"Never judge a book by its cover," Su Yang said with a smile on his face after seeing her dazed expression.

Lian Li swallowed nervously when she smelled the enchanting scent that was coming from his sword, and a single sniff of this scent instantly caused her little sister to tremble with excitement.

"Even though you have no experience, you should know what to do, right?" Su Yang asked her.

"I-I do! I may have no experience, but don’t treat me like I am a child!" Lian Li said before she grabbed his thick sword with her hands, wrapping her slim fingers around the stiff meatstick and feeling its hot temperature.

’Even my sword’s handle is not this thick...’ Lian Li compared Su Yang’s meatstick with her sword as she began stroking it softly and slowly, feeling fascinated by it.

However, after many minutes of stroking, Su Yang suddenly said in a disappointed voice, "Is that all you can do? I am already getting bored."

"W-What else am I supposed to do?!" Lian Li said to him with a frown.

"I don’t want to treat you like a child, so figure it out on yourself." Su Yang shook his head at her.

"..."

Lian Li was speechless. How else is she supposed to please him without her hands?

After a moment of pondering, Lian Li finally realized the meaning behind his words, and she exclaimed, "Y-You want me to use my mouth?! That’s dirty!"

Hearing her words, Su Yang quickly frowned and said to her, "How dare you call it dirty? If you don’t want to do it, then we can forget about this altogether."

"..."

Lian Li bit her lips after hearing his words, and she began moving her head towards the sword before licking it with her soft tongue a moment later.

’What a strong smell! It’s making me go crazy!’ Lian Li thought to herself as a pleasant-smelling odor penetrated her nose, feeling slightly lightheaded after taking a few sniffs.

Her body was also getting hotter, and the tingling sensation between her legs was getting stronger.

’This smell... this taste... I cannot get enough of it!’

Once licking it could no longer satisfy her l.u.s.t, Lian Li opened her mouth wide and swallowed Su Yang’s meatstick whole.

*Slurp* *Slurp*

Sucking and slurping noises quickly filled the room as Lian Li gave Su Yang a passionate fellatio, and even though her techniques were not the best, the feeling of her small mouth and her intense movements made up for it.

Lian Li increased her intensity as she got more comfortable sucking on Su Yang’s rod, and she even started using her throat to please him sometime later.

"Since you are putting so much effort into this, I shall reward you with my precious Yang Qi." Su Yang suddenly said to Lian Li, but she was too engrossed in the fellatio to hear his words.

A moment later, a load of steaming hot Yang Qi gushed from Su Yang’s hot rod and flowed directly into Lian Li’s throat, nearly choking her from surprise.

"Ah!"

Lian Li quickly stopped the fellatio and began coughing, but Yang Qi continued to ejaculate from Su Yang’s body, shooting and sticking it all over Lian Li’s face.

"What is that?! It’s all over my face, and I even swallowed some!" she looked at him with teary eyes afterward.

"You don’t even know what Yang Qi is? It’s what men use to i.m.p.r.e.g.n.a.t.e women." Su Yang said to her.

"I-I.m.p.r.e.g.n.a.t.e?! D-Don’t tell me I am going to be pregnant because I swallowed it?!" she looked at him with wide eyes filled with shock.

"What? That’s not how it works, you innocent princess." Su Yang shook his head at her. "Unless it enters your uterus through the hole between your legs and fertilizes your eggs, you won’t get i.m.p.r.e.g.n.a.t.ed, and my Yang Qi is special, so unless I allow it, you won’t get pregnant even if I do fill your hole with it."

"S-So I won’t get pregnant?" Lian Li sighed in relief after hearing his explanation.
