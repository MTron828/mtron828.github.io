395 Hong Yu’er’s Real Cultivation

"What an unprecedented event..."

The audience was dumbstruck by this situation, something nobody there could’ve predicted.

"I-I hate you, Sister Hong!" Su Yin was at a loss for words.

"It’s your fault for trying to separate us, Su Yin." Hong Yu’er casually shrugged. "Even if you are his little sister, I won’t let you get away without any consequences."

"Anyway, have you come to a conclusion? If you don’t surrender within the next ten seconds, I will remove the lower half of your robes."

When the male audience heard Hong Yu’er’s words, their minds couldn’t help but imagine the scene. On one hand, they do not support Hong Yu’er’s method of forcing Su Yin to surrender. On the other hand, however, they wouldn’t mind seeing this entire thing play out to the very end.

Damn it! This wasn’t supposed to happen! I was supposed to beat her fair and square and have Elder Brother praise me afterward!’ Su Yin was on the verge of crying out loud.

"Ten... nine... eight..." Hong Yu’er began counting down, causing Su Yin’s body to tremble.

"I will not forgive you for this...!" Su Yin slowly raised her hand, seemingly prepared to surrender.

However, just as she was about to open her mouth and surrender, a familiar voice resounded in Su Yin’s head.

The Vanishing Sword Dance is a technique that focuses on fooling one’s perception. You won’t see it with just your eyes. You need to feel the wind in the air and predict the sword’s direction.’

"Elder Brother?!" Su Yin was pleasantly surprised to hear Su Yang’s voice in her head.

"Five... four... three..." Hong Yu’er continued counting down.

Close your eyes.’

"C-Close my eyes?" Su Yin was speechless.

To close one’s eyes before a swordmaster during a battle was akin to accepting death.

However, as ridiculous as it may sound, Su Yin has unwavering faith in Su Yang, so she closed her eyes and lowered her arm.

"Two... one... zero." Hong Yu’er raised the sword in her grasp slightly. "You can only blame yourself for being stubborn, little sister."

"The right!" Su Yin’s eyes suddenly snapped open.

"Second Heavenly Form — Heavenly Spiral Fist!"

Ting!

A sharp sound of metal colliding with each other resounded in the area.

"Oh?" Hong Yu’er’s eyes widened slightly, seemingly surprised that Su Yin had barely blocked her strike.

"I-I did it! I blocked it!" Su Yin shouted in a cheerful tone while looking at Su Yang, who was sitting in the audience.

Seeing Su Yin look at Su Yang, Hong Yu’er immediately realized how Su Yin understood the trick to her Vanishing Sword Dance so quickly.

"Is this your way of telling me to fight her properly, Su Yang?" A small smile appeared on Hong Yu’er’s face. "If that’s what you want, I’ll become a little serious just for you, my darling."

"Little sister, here I come!" Hong Yu’er suddenly tossed the sword in her hands and rushed at Su Yin.

"What are you trying to do now?!"

Surprised by Hong Yu’er’s puzzling action, Su Yin prepared to run away.

You wanted to fight me properly, right? Allow me to fulfill your wish!"

Hong Yu’er imitated Su Yin’s previous movements and pushed her fists forward.

"Second Heavenly Form — Heavenly Spiral Fist!"

"What?!"

Su Yin was too surprised to see Hong Yu’er use her own technique to even defend herself properly, allowing the strike to connect perfectly.

"Ah!"

Su Yin shouted in pain as her body was tossed into the air before flying many meters into the distance after being struck, feeling as though she’d just been stomped by an elephant.

"What?! Impossible! How does Hong Yu’er know that technique?!" Bai Lihua and the other disciples were as shocked as SuYin.

Unless Su Yang also shared the technique with Hong Yu’er, there was no way she could’ve learned this technique.

However, Su Yang never shared this technique with her, so the only explanation would be that Hong Yu’er had learned the technique after watching Su Yin use it.

Of course, besides Su Yang and his vast experience as an Immortal, someone with such monstrous talent shouldn’t exist yet — unless Hong Yu’er was similar to Su Yang — someone whose experience surpasses all of this world’s logic.

"This is a pretty decent technique for a Heaven-grade technique." Hong Yu’er casually said.

"H-How do you know that technique?!" Su Yin spoke as she struggled to stand up. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

"If you keep using the same technique over and over again, I’m going to learn it even if I don’t want to."

"What kind of nonsense is that?" Su Yin didn’t know whether to laugh or cry at such ridiculous words.

"Are you ready to give up yet, little sister? You should have realized by now that you can’t defeat me." Hong Yu’er said to her.

"Never!" Su Yin shouted.

Hong Yu’er sighed. "What a pity."

A moment later, an invisible pressure appeared in the arena, dumbfounding Su Yin and the audience.

"W-What is going on?!" Su Yin looked at Hong Yu’er with wide eyes filled with disbelief.

"If I don’t show you the difference between us clearly, you will never understand it."

A vast amount of Profound Qi suddenly exuded from Hong Yu’er’s body, causing her cultivation base to skyrocket in levels.

The first level of the Earth Spirit Realm... the second level... the third level... the fourth level...

Within just a few seconds, Hong Yu’er’s cultivation base soared from the peak of the True Spirit Realm to the peak of the Earth Spirit Realm!

"I-Impossible..." Su Yin’s face turned blank, looking as though she was daydreaming.

"I am not finished yet..."

With another push, Hong Yu’er’s cultivation base advanced by another level, entering the Heavenly Spirit Realm.

"Good heavens..." Bai Lihua and Lord Xie mumbled simultaneously.

Xie Xingfang remained silent, but hidden behind her veil was a serious expression.

As for the audience, they were all shocked silent.

It was so quiet within the colosseum that even a pin drop could be heard from a mile away!
