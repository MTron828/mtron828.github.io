Chapter 805 - Following Su Yang to the Eastern Continent

"Connecting the five continents...?" Emperor Lian pondered with a serious look on his face after learning about the situation from Lian Li.

While there are many benefits from connecting the continents, such as having new business partners and expanding their world, there are also many downfalls if such a thing were to really happen, such as conflicts between the continents.

"If you’re worried about conflicts between each continent, Su Yang said that he’ll set up a meeting for every participating continent so the rulers of each continent could speak with each other and hopefully come to an agreement." Lian Li said, almost as though she could read Emperor Lian’s mind and worries.

"A meeting with the other ruling families, huh? That would be great and an unprecedented event." Emperor Lian said.

And he continued, "Although our Ancestors have traveled to the Eastern Continent in the past, I don’t think all five continents have ever come together before. This is definitely going to be revolutionary..."

"I also have to speak with the other Ancient Academies about this..."

Lian Li nodded and said, "Take your time."

Sometime later, Su Yang returned alone.

Emperor Lian looked at him with an awkward expression before speaking, "I have already been briefed by Lian Li about your plans to connect all five continents. Give me some time to speak with the Ancient Academies and other families."

Su Yang nodded, "Okay."

He then turned to look at Lian Li and said, "This leaves the Southern Continent as our last stop. Shall we start making our way there now?"

Lian Li nodded and prepared to leave.

Su Yang suddenly turned to look at Emperor Lian and said, "By the way, I’ll be back later to bring Feng Xindou with me to the Eastern Continent."

"W-What?" Emperor Lian looked at him with a dazed face. "W-Why is she leaving this place?"

Even Lian Li was surprised to hear this, but she didn’t say anything.

"You can ask her yourself. I think she’ll do a better job explaining it." Su Yang said.

Sometime later, once Su Yang left with Lian Li, Emperor Lian rushed to find Feng Xindou, who was laying in a large bed in one of the guest rooms with a satisfied expression on her face while completely n.a.k.e.d.

"My wife! I heard from Su Yang that you’ll be following him to the Eastern Continent! Is this true?! Why do you want to leave this place?!" Emperor Lian asked her in a nervous, shaky voice.

"Lower your voice. Why are you shouting like it’s the end of the world? And yes, I’ll be following Su Yang to the Eastern Continent. This way, it’ll be more convenient for him to treat my condition, and I’m sure you don’t want to be around us when we’re doing it, right?" Feng Xindou explained to him her reasons in a calm voice.

"T-That’s..." Emperor Lian was speechless. Of course, he didn’t want to be around them when they do ’that’. Who in their right mind would want to be around while someone else is screwing their wife? Only a real cuck would enjoy something like that!

"How long will you be there?" He then asked her.

"Probably until Su Yang finally leaves this world with Lian Li and the others," she calmly responded.

"So I won’t be able to see you for an entire year, huh?" Emperor Lian sighed.

"It’s not as if I am leaving forever." Feng Xindou said.

"I know... but still..."

Meanwhile, Su Yang and Lian Li traveled to the Southern Region, visiting the Ji Family once again.

"S-Senior! What happened?! Why are you back here?" Ji Hong was surprised to see Su Yang again so soon, even a little bit nervous about why he’d decided to return.

"Do you know who rules over the Southern Continent? I want to meet them." Su Yang asked him.

"The rulers?" Ji Hong raised his eyebrows, and then he said, "While we don’t really have an official ruling family for the Southern Continent, there’s one family in the Southern Continent that has incredible influence and power— so much so that many people willingly recognize them as their ruler."

"Where can I find this family?" Su Yang then asked.

"The Lu Family is a very exclusive family— they won’t meet anyone without proper recommendations. However, my Ji Family can give you that recommendation. It’ll take a couple of days, though." Ji Hong said.

Su Yang nodded and said, "Then I’ll leave it to you." ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

"I will do my best! And if you need a place to stay, there are plenty of guest rooms in my household. You can stay here for as long as you need."

"We won’t be humble and accept that offer."

Sometime later, Su Yang and the others followed Ji Hong to one of the guest rooms.

"Every single room in this hallway is free to use," Ji Hong said to them after they arrived.

"We just need one room," Su Yang said.

"Then please use this room— it’s the biggest one we have. If you need anything, just ring this bell and a servant will be with you to satisfy your every need. In the meantime, I’ll go write up your recommendation letter and send it to the Lu Family."

"Thank you for your help," Su Yang said to him.

Once Ji Hong left the place, Su Yang turned to look at Xiao Rong and said to her, "Since we have some free time, do you want your reward now?"

Xiao Rong immediately nodded her head and stripped her clothes before Su Yang could even say anything.

"You’re going to cultivate with her?" Lian Li asked him with a dazed expression on her face.

Su Yang chuckled and said, "Of course not. I am just going to satisfy her with my hands and collect her Yin Qi at the same time."

"Collecting her Yin Qi? Why do you need her Yin Qi?" Lian Li became even more dumbfounded after hearing his response.

Su Yang then proceeded to explain to Lian Li his plans to preserve Xiao Rong’s Yin Qi so that he can use it in the future when he’s powerful enough to absorb it without risking his own life.
