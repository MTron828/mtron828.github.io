Chapter 755 The Real Hong Yu“er

"Su Yang... There’s no need to thank me for what I’ve done, as I’d benefited greatly from lending my body, too. If not for Senior Tang, I would not have reached the Heavenly Spirit Realm at this age. Furthermore, my view of this world— the cultivation world would have remained as insignificant as an ant."

"How much of Lingxi’s memories do you have?" Su Yang then asked her. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

"Only what she willingly shared with me. Although our souls were temporarily merged together and she could see all of my memories, it didn’t work the same way for me, as her soul was simply too powerful for me to even peek. However, I know a fair bit of the Divine Heavens and Senior Tang’s background," Hong Yu’er responded with a calm expression on her face.

"Is that so? Then what do you plan on doing now?"

"I...I don’t know," Hong Yu’er shook her head, and she continued after a moment of silence, "When we were officially engaged, I’d hated your guts because I thought you were idiotic or mindless, and I made it my life’s mission to escape from you, but alas, after learning the truth from Senior Tang, I... I have changed, as did my views of you and this world, and I don’t know what I should do from now on anymore..."

"I don’t have any advice for you, but if you need someone to talk to, you know where to find me. And because of what you’ve done for Lingxi, if you need anything from me, I shall do my best to fulfill your desires."

Hong Yu’er nodded. "I will return to my family for the time being, and I will slowly decide what I want to do from now on."

Su Yang nodded and turned around, preparing to fly away.

"Wait a second, Su Yang!" Hong Yu’er suddenly stopped him.

"What is it?" he turned around to look at her with a calm gaze.

"You will be leaving this world to go to the Divine Heavens soon, right?"

"That’s right."

"I see..." Hong Yu’er nodded, and after a moment of silence, she continued, "By the way, Senior Tang... she really loves you. Because we share the same body, I was able to feel what she felt— her emotions... everything. Although I don’t know what she’s thinking, I know for sure that she has endured a lot trying to resist her urges to pounce on you. Honestly, I probably wouldn’t have minded it if she really did it, but I am also relieved that she’d managed to keep her promise with me."

"I know... Lingxi is a strong woman, and I am blessed to have someone like her in my life. My years of efforts chasing after her— it was definitely worth it. Anyway, is that all you have to say?"

"Yes. I’ll see you later, Su Yang." Hong Yu’er nodded.

A few moments later, Su Yang flew back to the Profound Blossom Sect with a solemn feeling around him.

Meanwhile, Hong Yu’er remained at the mountain peak for a little longer to stare at the horizon.

Sometimes later, Hong Yu’er mumbled in a puzzled voice, "Senior Tang... I had given you the permission to cultivate with him... Why did you refuse? You’d suffered plenty because of it."

"I really want to know your answer, but I guess that’s no longer possible now since you are no longer in this world."

After spending a few more minutes lingering around the mountain peak, Hong Yu’er also flew away and made her way back to the Hong Family.

After returning to the Profound Blossom Sect, Su Yang went back to his room and proceeded to sit by the window and stared at the horizon for the entire day with a blank look on his face, looking like he’d lost a partner or something.

"The moment you went away, this world suddenly became darker, and the void in my chest returned. I... really cannot stay in this world for long or I might really go crazy," Su Yang sighed in a low voice.

Sometime later, the door to his room was knocked on.

*Knock* *Knock*

"Are you inside, Su Yang?" Wu Jingjing’s voice resounded outside afterward.

"I am. Come inside," Su Yang said.

Hearing his words, Wu Jingjing opened the door and came into his room with the other two goddesses— Zhu Mengyi and Lian Li.

And the moment they saw Su Yang’s face, they could instantly tell that he was in a bad mood.

"Are you okay, Su Yang? Sister Lingxi has returned to the Divine Heavens, right?" Wu Jingjing asked him.

"Yes, she’s gone. And although I am feeling a little lonely, it’s nothing I cannot handle," Su Yang said, not even bothering to hide his emotions like normally.

The goddesses exchanged looks with each other, and then they approached Su Yang.

"The babies are asleep now. If you want, we can accompany you for the rest of the night until you are feeling better. Although we cannot replace Sister Lingxi, we still want to relieve some of your pain," Wu Jingjing said to him.

Su Yang immediately smiled and said, "There’s no need for you— or any of you to ’replace’ Lingxi, as you are you and Lingxi is Lingxi. Thank you for worrying about me, but it’s really not that serious."

"Then you don’t want to cultivate?" Zhu Mengyi asked him.

Su Yang chuckled and said, "Now who said anything about not wanting to cultivate? Strip! We’re going to have fun all night!"

The goddesses looked at each other with a relieved smile on their beautiful faces before they removed their clothes and went on the bed with Su Yang before cuddling each other for the entire night.

During their cultivation session, the girls quickly noticed that Su Yang was being a little more aggressive and intimate than normal, but that didn’t bother them even the slightest, as it’d aroused their lust more than usual, allowing them to enjoy the cultivation more.
