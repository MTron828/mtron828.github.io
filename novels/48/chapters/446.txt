Chapter 447 I“ve Got You Now!

"Where the hell do you think you are going?"

When Chief Long suddenly switched targets to Qin Liangyu, Su Yang’s eyes flickered with killing intent, and he used the second level of Nine Astral Step to appear behind Chief Long in the blink of an eye.

However, a wide grin appeared on Chief Long’s face as she suddenly turned around to face Su Yang, almost like he’d been waiting for this exact moment.

"I’ve got you now!" Chief Long pounced his claws at Su Yang with extreme speed, arriving at Su Yang’s face before faster than one can blink his eyes.

"Su Yang!" Qiuyue’s heart expanded to its maximum with anxiety upon seeing this, and she began flying at them in hopes that she could make it in time to protect him.

However, someone grabbed onto her shoulders and forced her to stop before she could move very far.

Qiuyue turned around to see Tang Lingxi, who calmly shook her head.

"Calm down, Junior Sister. Do you think this is his first time fighting or something? He’ll be fine."

Qiuyue looked a bit dazed for a moment. She then turned around to watch the situation again. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

"Eh?"

Qiuyue’s eyes widened with shock when she saw the scene. A moment ago, Chief Long had attempted to trick Su Yang into lowering his guard by suddenly targeting Qin Liangyu, before turning around to attack him.

But now that she’s looking at the situation again, Su Yang was perfectly fine. As for Chief Long... he stood there with a terrified expression, and the arm that was an inch away from Su Yang’s handsome face had suddenly been separated from his body and landed a few meters away!

It looked like Chief Long’s arm had been severed by something sharp — something like a sword. However, Su Yang’s hands were empty, so it was impossible that he’d been struck by a sword.

"W-What did you do to me?" Chief Long coughed up a mouthful of blood before he began swaying backward.

"Did you really think that I would fall for something so basic?" Su Yang stared directly into Chief Long’s eyes, who felt like he was as naked as an open book before Su Yang’s sharp gazes.

"And I don’t need a weapon to kill someone like you. My hands are just enough." Su Yang continued.

"I was playing with you just now, since you are partially responsible for the Lion Tribe’s actions today, and I was prepared to return to you the Black Dragon Axe after some time, but you had to go ahead and do something as stupid as targeting Chief Qin."

Although his hands were empty, they lingered with Sword Qi.

The place was dead silent, and the people from the Boar Tribe were all staring at Su Yang as though he was the God of War.

"P-Please... spare my life... I won’t ask you to return the Black Dragon Axe anymore..." Chief Long trembled in fear.

Even though Su Yang’s cultivation base is significantly lower than his own, the difference in their strength and techniques were worlds apart. It felt like he was fighting with someone who has countless years more experience than himself.

"Don’t worry, I never intended to kill you in the first place. I also know why you are targeting the Boar Tribe, so let me tell you this — the thing you are looking for is no longer with the Boar Tribe, since it’s in my hands now."

"Of course, you are always welcomed to try and take it from me like the Black Dragon Axe."

"..."

Chief Long’s eyes widened again, but he didn’t say anything, as he was speechless.

"There’s no longer any reason why you should come near the Boar Tribe again. I can’t guarantee that you will leave with your life the next time you come here. Am I making myself clear?" Su Yang spoke to Chief Long in a commanding voice, leaving no opportunity for him to refuse.

"I-I understand..." Chief Long nodded his head in a stiff movement.

"Good. Then get out of my sight."

After saying those words, Su Yang turned around and no longer paid attention to Chief Long, who quickly scurried away from the Boar Tribe.

"Are you okay?" Su Yang approached Qin Liangyu with a smile on his face afterward.

"Y-Yes..." Qin Liangyu slowly nodded her head with a dazed expression.

"It’s unfortunate that I was unable to save everyone from the Boar Tribe. I’m sorry."

Su Yang said as he looked at the surroundings.

The Boar Tribe was littered with corpses as of this moment. While the majority of them belonged to the Lion Tribe, there were many fallen warriors from the Boar Tribe’s side, too.

"No... you have done nothing that would require you to apologize, Senior Su. If not for you, there would have been far more casualties. Thank you for saving the Boar Tribe..."

Qin Liangyu suddenly got onto her knees and kowtowed to him.

When the other tribesmen saw their Chief’s action, they also knelt on the ground and kowtowed to Su Yang, thanking him in silence.

"Stand up. Although the war is over, there’s still work to be done here."

Qin Liangyu then stood up and spoke in a loud voice, "We are going to clean this place up!"

"Yes, Chief!"

Sometime later, Qiuyue and Tang Lingxi approached Su Yang.

"Are you okay, Su Yang?" Qiuyue asked him.

"I am fine—"

"Stop lying." Tang Ling suddenly interrupted.

"You used Celestial Qi during both of your fights. Although you may appear fine on the outside, I can tell that you are actually exhausted."

"Eh? Really?!" Qiuyue was dumbfounded. It’s no wonder why he was able to overpower two peak Heavenly Spirit Realm experts with such ease!

Su Yang showed a smile and said, "I really can’t hide anything from you, Lingxi."

"Indeed, I feel a little tired. But besides feeling sleepy, I am really fine. I want to adapt to the Celestial Qi in my body, so I have been training with it."

"Don’t push yourself too hard. It’s not easy to control Celestial Qi, and that’s true even for me." Tang Lingxi said.

"I won’t—"

Before he could even finish his words, his vision blacken.

"S-Su Yang!!!"

His sudden collapse greatly startled Qiuyue, and she immediately went to catch his falling body.

"Relax, Junior Sister. He’s only sleeping. He’ll be fine after a few days of rest." Tang Lingxi said to her, relieving her of her worries.
