"Your Majesty, what if that bastard does something inappropriate to the Young Lady? We won’t be able to protect her if something goes wrong at this rate..."

The guards expressed worry about the situation, feeling as though Xie Xingfang was being thrown into a lion’s den as a rabbit.

"You don’t have to worry. He won’t touch her," said Lord Xie with a clear voice.

The guards stared at him with awe. How could he be so confident about that?

"That man... he actually managed to stare at my daughter in the eyes without any emotions, almost like he was only looking at your average girl... I have never met another man beside myself that can look at her with such pure eyes..."

Xie Xingfang could be considered one of if not the most beautiful women in this Eastern Continent, so people more often than not stare at her with either lustful gazes or dreamy thoughts, hence why she wears a veil over her face whenever she leaves this building.

With that being said, Su Yang has seen countless beautiful women in his lifetime, and in his eyes, Xie Xingfang’s appearance is not something that can awe him as she does to others.

The guards turned silent after hearing Lord Xie’s explanation. They all knew how hard it was to look at Xie Xingfang with pure thoughts, as none of them have been successful to this day even after seeing her countless times for many years.

"And even if he wants to do something funny to my daughter, she is not any weaker than me in some situations," said Lord Xie. "Her Heavenly Constitution is not just for show, after all."

Although Xie Xingfang is nowhere near his level of cultivation, her prowess has increased significantly ever since half a year ago when she returned from her adventure. But since Xie Xingfang did not explain to Lord Xie the reason behind her sudden growth, he could only wonder with his imagination.

"That’s right! As long as the Young Lady activates her Hundred Poisons Body, even Heavenly Spirit Realm experts will fall to its potency!"

The guards came to that realization.

Meanwhile, inside Xie Xingfang’s private room, Su Yang was casually sipping on tea that was brewed by Xie Xingfang herself.

"What do you think of my tea, senior brother Xiao?" Xie Xingfang asked him as she sat beside him.

"You can just call me Su Yang. Xiao Yang is merely an alias for when I travel, and you don’t have to be so formal." Su Yang said to her.

"As for this tea... you made it yourself?" He then asked her.

"Y-Yes..."

Although she was slightly surprised by this new information, she was also glad that he decided to reveal to her his real identity, as it signifies his trust for her.

"The herbs used to make this tea are also farmed by myself. If you’d like to see it, I can bring you to my garden afterward."

"If you are talking about the one behind this building, then I have already seen it," said Su Yang, who’d inspected this place with his Spiritual Sense the moment he arrived.

"...?"

Senior Zhong, who was standing by the door like a servant, looked at Su Yang with a frown. As far as he’s aware, Su Yang has been by his side since before they even stepped into this place, so how did he know about Xie Xingfang’s garden, much less see it?

Xie Xingfang nodded. "By the way, I hope that my father hadn’t troubled you just now," she said a moment later.

"What makes you think that he’d caused me trouble?" Su Yang asked with a smile.

Xie Xingfang chuckled and spoke, "Because he has a very stubborn character. And since he wants you to be a Guardian for our Xie Family, I can only imagine that."

"Well, although it’s not much, I nearly lost my head in that room." Su Yang also began laughing.

"What?!" Xie Xingfang was shocked by his words.

"What nonsense are you talking about?" Senior Zhong coldly snorted. "That was something you brought upon yourself."

"Senior Zhong, how could you say that! Don’t worry, Su Yang, I will surely speak to my father afterward about this!" Xie Xingfang said to him.

Although she doesn’t know what he did to have caused such a situation, she couldn’t help but side with Su Yang, as he was her benefactor.

"I don’t mind it," said Su Yang. "After all, as Senior Zhong had said, it was my fault."

"Anyway, I am sure that you didn’t bring me here just to drink tea, right?" He looked at Xie Xingfang, who looked as though she was a child with exciting news to share.

After a moment of silence, Xie Xingfang raised her hands and spoke, "Please, look at my body."

"..."

Senior Zhong’s eyes widened with shock, and he quickly intervened, "What are you saying, Young Lady?!"

However, Xie Xingfang showed a puzzled face and asked, "Is there something wrong, Senior Zhong?"

"Y-Y-You... how could you request such an indecent thing from someone you barely know?!"

Senior Zhong said, dumbfounding her. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Xie Xingfang frowned. "Indecent? What’s so indecent about my..."

However, she paused midway through her sentence after realizing what she’d said just now and quickly blushed.

"I-I-I didn’t mean it like that! I only wanted him to look at my Heavenly Constitution!" she quickly explained herself, but alas, that only worsened Senior Zhong’s misunderstanding.

"You want him to look at your Heavenly Constitution?!"

Clearly, Senior Zhong had forgotten that Su Yang has the ability to look at Xie Xingfang’s Heavenly Constitution without needing her to strip naked.

"Senior Zhong! If you don’t shut up, I will throw you out of my room!" Xie Xingfang shouted, her cheeks burning with redness.

"Unless you kill this old man, don’t even think about forcing me to leave!"

Su Yang shook his head and said to Xie Xingfang, "Give me your hand."

Xie Xingfang took a deep breath and showed him her smooth palm.

Su Yang ignored Senior Zhong, who was staring at him with glaring eyes that threatened to kill him if he does anything funny and grabbed Xie Xingfang’s fair hands.

He then wastes no time probing her body with his Profound Qi.

"Hmm?" Su Yang raised an eyebrow a moment later, seemingly puzzled by something.

"I-Is there something wrong?" Xie Xingfang asked with a worried tone after seeing his expression.
