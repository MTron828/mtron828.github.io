"What’s the matter, senior apprentice-brother? Who are you waving at?" Sun Jingjing asked him.

"Just a friend in the crowd," he replied with a mysterious smile.

"..."

Liu Lanzhi looked at Su Yang with suspicious eyes. He was clearly waving at the Heavenly Swan Sect. But why would he wave at them?

After the Heavenly Swan Sect left the area, the Profound Blossom Sect continued to wait in the queue.

An hour later, another commotion occurred.

"Look! It’s the Burning Lotus Sect!"

The crowd became as excited if not even more than previously when the Heavenly Swan Sect appeared.

During the last few months, the Burning Lotus Sect became more and more relevant within the continent, even being appointed as an Elite Sect by the Xie Family.

Elite Sect are Sects that have proven their worth to be at the top, such as the Heavenly Swan Sect and the Million Snakes Sect, and only the Xie Family has the authority to decide who becomes an Elite Sect.

Of course, one of the biggest reasons the Burning Lotus Sect grew with such prominence in such a short time was all because of Wang Shuren and her Burning Lotus Pills.

Not only did the Burning Lotus Pills greatly increase their disciples’ overall cultivation base but it even made them extremely wealthy. With their new profound wealth and prowess, the Xie Family decided to make the Burning Lotus Sect an Elite Sect.

As for Wang Shuren, the direct cause of this, she became one of, if not the most, important individuals in the Eastern Continent, mainly because of her profound Alchemy skills and the Burning Lotus Pills.

"Were the Burning Lotus Sect always this popular?" One of the Junior Disciples asked.

"No, I don’t think so..." said another.

The Burning Lotus Sect and their red carriages slowly rode to the entrance. However, just as they reached the middle, the carriages came to a sudden halt.

"Why are they stopping there?"

The crowd wondered.

A few moments later, the door to the first carriage opened, and a beautiful woman with a captivating figure stepped out of the carriage.

"It’s Senior Wang!"

Countless gazes immediately fell upon Wang Shuren and her plentiful body the second she made an appearance.

There were many people there who were instantly charmed by her mature aura, even aroused by her seemingly seductive appearance.

"That’s Senior Wang? She’s much more beautiful and charming than the rumors!" Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

"Not only does she have the appearance of a goddess but she is also a genius Alchemy Master! She is the definition of a perfect woman!"

Meanwhile, Wang Shuren ignored the glaring and walked straight towards the queue, where the Profound Blossom Sect was standing around.

"She’s heading this way!"

The male Junior Disciples could feel their hearts throbbing like drums, their faces flushed red from bashfulness, as Wang Shuren’s presence was too much for these young ones to handle.

"N-No way! She’s looking this way!"

The disciples only grew more excited as Wang Shuren approached them with seductive movements.

"You guys are also here, huh..."

Wang Shuren stood directly before the Profound Blossom Sect.

"It’s been a while," said Su Yang.

"Su Yang..."

Wang Shuren didn’t know how to respond to his words, as she literally saw him just two weeks ago... in his room...

Of course, ever since her first dual cultivation session with Su Yang, Wang Shuren has been returning for more during the last few months. And in order to not draw suspicion, she would make it seem as though she was doing business with Su Yang.

Thus, the Profound Blossom Sect has a plentiful stock of Burning Lotus Pills as the outcome.

"Anyway, what do you want from us?" Liu Lanzhi stepped forward and asked her, as she cannot figure out what Wang Shuren was planning.

"It’s nothing much, but if you don’t want to stand there for an entire day, why don’t you follow us into the city?" Wang Shuren said.

Although she made it seem as though she wanted to help the Profound Blossom Sect, her true intention was to help Su Yang, who is the only reason that the Burning Lotus Sect and herself can enjoy such privilege as an Elite Sect.

Liu Lanzhi narrowed her eyes, clearly suspicious of Wang Shuren. After all, why would someone as famous and respected as her treat them so graciously? While they have been doing business for the past few months, there are plenty of other places that do business with them, so why are they the ones with the special treatment?

Everything about Wang Shuren’s offer seemed fishy to Liu Lanzhi.

Wang Shuren noticed Liu Lanzhi’s doubt just from her gaze, and she continued, "You can continue standing here if you want, but I hope you had reserved a place to stay in advance. It won’t be easy to find one later."

"Thank you for worrying about my Profound Blossom Sect, but I have already prepared a place to stay for us."

"If you say so."

Wang Shuren no longer bothered them and began walking back to the carriages shortly after.

"Sect Master... why didn’t you accept her offer? If she’s offended by this..."

The sect elders looked at Liu Lanzhi with puzzled expressions, as they cannot find any logical reason for her to refuse Wang Shuren’s offer.

"I don’t know. It’s just that something about the way she approached us felt odd, almost sketchy..."

Su Yang chuckled inwardly after hearing her words.

He then spoke, "Sect Master, I think we should follow them."

"Su Yang, you..."

Liu Lanzhi looked at him with slightly widened eyes. Maybe he’s the actual reason why Wang Shuren even approached them in the first place — not for the Profound Blossom Sect — hence why she felt that something was suspicious.

When Wang Shuren heard Su Yang’s words, she immediately halted her movements and turned around to look at them.

"I knew it! She doesn’t give a damn about the Profound Blossom Sect! It’s Su Yang who’s receiving her special treatment!"

Liu Lanzhi confirmed this after seeing Wang Shuren’s reaction.

"Haaa..." she sighed in defeat a moment later before nodding her head, agreeing to his suggestion.
