Chapter 797 - Banned From Participating

’This guy, Su Yang! He was not joking when he said I won’t stand a chance against him!’ Xian Ni stared at Su Yang’s domineering figure and tyrannical aura with a gawking look on his face.

How can someone at the Heavenly Spirit Realm emit such a powerful aura when even Sovereign Spirit Realm Cultivators could not? Is this the difference between a real Immortal and a fake Immortal? Just how deep does Su Yang’s strength go?

"You can send in the next participant," Su Yang suddenly said.

A few moments of silence later, one of the experts there went onto the stage and carried the unconscious young man off the stage.

"Please give us a moment to bring in the next participant." The expert said to Su Yang before leaving the stage.

"Who is next?! Quickly get on the stage!" One of the elders from the Nine Immortal Families said to the participants that were holed up somewhere inside the colosseum.

"Are you crazy?! You want us to fight that monster?! There’s no way that’s possible! Not even my father could defeat that man!" One of the participants suddenly said.

The other participants followed and began complaining. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

"That’s right! I don’t want to die!"

"Did you see his aura?! That’s not something you can fight! Forget about tiring him out! His aura will exhaust us before we can even step onto the stage! This is impossible!"

"ENOUGH!"

Someone suddenly roared, instantly silencing the place.

The people there turned to look in the direction of the voice to see nine figures standing side by side not far in the distance.

"The Nine Immortal Families Patriarchs!"

The participants immediately recognized their faces.

"I don’t want to hear any more complaints! So what if he has an impressive aura? So what if you cannot defeat him? Don’t forget your status and where you came from! Don’t forget the Xian Family is watching all of us! Don’t forget that Ancestor Xian is also here!"

"I don’t care if you’re scared! You WILL stand on the stage and fight him!"

"If you surrender or refuse to fight him, your sect or family will be banned from participating in the next 3 tournaments!"

The participants there stared at these nine Patriarchs with shocked expressions on their faces.

They’ll be banned from participating in the tournament? That’s ridiculous and overbearing as hell!

However, as much as they wanted to complain, these participants didn’t dare to offend or oppose the heads of the Nine Immortal Families, so they can only nod their heads in silence.

Seeing the participants nod, the Patriarchs said, "Good! Then whoever is next in line, get out there and fight him!"

Sometime later, another young man approached the stage. However, his aura was nonexistent compared to Su Yang’s aura, and there was not even the slightest of confidence that could be felt coming from this young man.

Once the new challenger stepped onto the stage, his legs began shaking even more uncontrollably, almost they were made of tofu.

"Since you dared to stand before me, I will assume that you’ve accepted the risk." Su Yang said to the young man with a calm look on his face.

"Y-Y-Y-You can’t scare me!" The young man stuttered before taking out a spirit-grade spiritual treasure.

"Hmph!"

Su Yang coldly snorted, sending some of his Sword Intent at the young man.

WHOOSH!

A split second later, the Sword Intent slammed into the young man like an invisible wall before sending him flying out of the stage and into the audience, shocking everybody there.

"Next!" Su Yang did not even bother to look at the young man and shouted for the next opponent.

A few seconds later, another challenger stepped onto the stage.

However, this time, without waiting for the challenger to even fully stand on the stage, Su Yang attacked the challenger the second his foot touched the stage, sending him flying into the audience again.

"Next!"

Su Yang shouted in a domineering voice, his tyrannical aura growing stronger by the second.

A moment later, another participant was sent flying into the stage, his injuries worse than the previous two victims.

The Patriarchs frowned when they saw this.

"Is he slowly injuring his enemies more and more as a warning? Until one of them finally dies?" One of them couldn’t help but ask out loud.

"This lad... how bold..."

A dozen unconscious challengers later, the first female fighter appeared on the stage, and to everyone’s surprise, Su Yang didn’t immediately send her flying into the audience like the previous participants.

’I am safe...?’

The female fighter, who’d expected and prepared to be blown away the second she stepped onto the stage was pleasantly surprised that she’d managed to stand on the stage with both her legs!

However, before she could even open her mouth to speak, Su Yang said to her in a calm voice, "You have exactly three seconds to turn around and leave the stage before I strip you n.a.k.e.d before everyone here."

The female fighter’s jaw dropped to the ground after hearing Su Yang’s words. And seeing the seriousness in Su Yang’s eyes, this female fighter unconsciously took a step back.

However, she recalled the Patriarchs’ warning and gritted her teeth.

"Screw you!"

The female fighter suddenly rushed at Su Yang, but alas, before she could even take two steps, Su Yang released a torrent of Sword Qi at her, tearing her clothes to shreds.

"Aaahhhhh!"

Realizing that she was practically n.a.k.e.d, the female fighter immediately crouched down and blocked her chest with her arms.

"H-How dare you! Do you have any shame?! Are you even a man?!" she shouted at him with a fuming expression.

However, Su Yang remained nonchalant and said, "You have another three seconds to get off the stage before I sent you flying into the audience... unconscious."

The female fighter’s eyes widened with shock, and she immediately shouted, "I-I give up! I surrender! Please, don’t send me flying into the audience!"

The entire place turned dead silent afterward, and everyone there stared at Su Yang with disbelief in their eyes.
