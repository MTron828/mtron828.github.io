Chapter 818 - I Can Feel Them Kicking

After returning to the Profound Blossom Sect, Su Yang explained to Liu Lanzhi what had happened at the gathering.

"What? You’re going to let the Profound Blossom Sect sell Heavenly Ascendence Pills? How are we going to create something like that when you’re gone?" Liu Lanzhi couldn’t help but ask him.

Su Yang smiled and said, "Don’t worry, I’ll make enough Heavenly Ascendence Pills to last the Profound Blossom Sect and the other places hundreds of years before I leave, and there’ll be others who will be able to concoct such pills in the future."

"Enough to last us hundreds of years? That sounds like a lot..." Liu Lanzhi mumbled.

"If you sell the Heavenly Transcend Pill only to those who are at the peak of the Earth Spirit Realm, you’ll last many years with just a dozen of them. Furthermore, not everyone will be able to afford one, so you don’t have to worry about selling hundreds of them every day."

"I see... That makes a lot of sense." Liu Lanzhi nodded.

After talking to Liu Lanzhi, Su Yang returned to his own business.

The following day, Su Yang left the Profound Blossom Sect and went to the Xie Family, where he answered some of their questions.

"Su Yang, thank you for letting the Xie Family be part of the circle," Lord Xie couldn’t help but thank Su Yang, and he continued, "If not for that, our Xie Family would’ve definitely lost a lot of our standing in the Eastern Continent."

Su Yang casually waved his hand and said, "Of course you will— that’s why I included your family, and you don’t have to thank me. I am only doing this for Xing’er."

"Anyway, I will be concocting enough pills to last the Eastern Continent many years, so I’ll be needing a lot of ingredients."

Lord Xie did not complain at all and even felt passionate about looking for ingredients this time.

"What ingredients do you need? Just tell me and I’ll make sure it’s in your hands within a week!" Lord Xie said with eagerness in his voice.

Su Yang didn’t say anything else and placed a long list of ingredients on the table.

Lord Xie’s heart nearly jumped out of his chest when he saw the massive amount of medicine and ingredients on this list.

"T-This is going to cost a fortune!" Lord Xie exclaimed after reading the whole thing, and he continued, "I was prepared to spend a few dozen million spirit stones, but alas, I don’t think even a few hundred million spirit stones would be enough to buy the ingredients on this list!"

"Of course. That’s enough ingredients to make enough pills to last for many centuries. And I am not just concocting the Heavenly Ascendence Pill, as there will be other pills that I haven’t announced yet in there that will greatly benefit the cultivation world," said Su Yang.

And he continued, "Anyways, it might be an expensive investment, but you’ll make twice... even three times more than that from the pills that’ll come out of it."

"Is this going to be shared between the Heavenly Swan Sect, Burning Lotus Sect, Profound Blossom Sect, and the Xie Family?" Lord Xie then asked.

"Don’t worry, the Xie Family isn’t going to foot the entire bill. I have the Burning Lotus Sect’s money with me, and I will be paying for the Profound Blossom Sect as well as the Heavenly Swan Sect’s bill." Su Yang said as he placed a couple of storage rings on the desk.

"There are half a billion spirit stones inside these storage rings."

"Half a billion..." Lord Xie mumbled with a speechless look on his face. Even the Xie Family cannot afford to spend so much money at once!

"I understand. I’ll try to buy everything on the list as soon as possible." Lord Xie nodded a moment later.

"Then I’ll go see Xing’er for a bit before leaving."

Just as Su Yang turned around, Lord Xie suddenly said, "Wait a second, Su Yang. Do you have a date in mind for the other meeting?"

Su Yang nodded and said, "A little bit after I reach the Sovereign Spirit Realm, so in about three months."

"Okay."

After leaving the shopping chores to Lord Xie, Su Yang went to find Xie Xingfang and spend a few days with her, embracing her more than just a couple of times during these days.

"Su Yang, feel my stomach. I can feel them kicking..." Xie Xingfang said to him with a gentle smile on her peerless face.

Su Yang placed his hands onto her n.a.k.e.d stomach, and sure enough, he could feel something small kicking his hands.

"Even though I’d i.m.p.r.e.g.n.a.t.ed Lian Li first, it looks like you’ll be giving birth before her," said Su Yang afterward.

"How long do you think I have left?" Xie Xingfang asked him, her gaze filled with anticipation.

"Around next month," he responded after a moment of silence.

"That’s great! I cannot wait to see the twins!"

"I also cannot wait," Su Yang said with a smile on his face.

And he continued, "I will return in a month to help you deliver the babies."

Xie Xingfang did not doubt his abilities and immediately nodded, "Okay."

"Then I’ll be back next month." Su Yang kissed Xie Xingfang for a good minute before leaving the Xie Family and going to the Heavenly Swan Sect to meet with Bai Lihua.

"Did you find any candidates to fill your position and become the next Sect Master of the Heavenly Swan Sect yet?" Su Yang asked Bai Lihua.

"I have, and I am currently teaching her everything she needs to know. Hopefully, I can do it before we leave this world," she responded. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Sometime later, Su Yang began giving Bai Lihua lectures on alchemy again. Once it was nighttime, they began to cultivate with each other until the morning, where they repeated the process for the next few days.

Su Yang left the Heavenly Swan Sect a week later, returning to the Profound Blossom Sect, where he returned to his daily routine.
