Chapter 728 How He Obtained the Sword Emperor Title

"Teaching Xiao Rong about lust and pleasure? A Phantom Cat?" Tang Lingxi covered her mouth in shock, and she continued a moment later, "I know you are very confident in your abilities, but do you really think you can handle someone like Xiao Rong in your current state? I don’t think I need to tell you this, but you should be aware of Xiao Rong’s bloodline, right? Or more specifically, what happens when she awakens."

"Don’t you think it’s a little too early to teach Xiao Rong about lust?"

Su Yang nodded his head and said, "Yes, I am well aware of what will happen when Xiao Rong awakens her lustful state. However, she won’t awaken so quickly, and once I consume the Hellfire Seed, I will be more than capable of handling her."

"Xiao Rong? Phantom Cat? Who’s that?" Wu Jingjing asked after listening to their conversation, as this is her first time hearing this name.

Tang Lingxi then said, "Phantom Cats are a very rare species even in the Divine Heavens that are known as the ancestors of Ghost Cats, and Ghost Cats are extremely powerful creatures that are known to be unrivaled in terms of their speed. Meanwhile, Phantom Cats are not only fast but they can also use spiritual attacks. A single one of them could wreak havoc in the Divine Heavens, yet Su Yang somehow managed to tame one of them in this small world."

"As for Xiao Rong, that’s the Phantom Cat in her human form. Once magical beasts reach a certain cultivation level, they have the ability to transform into humans with all of our internal organs and whatnot."

After Tang Lingxi’s explanation, the three ladies immediately felt like meeting this Phantom Cat, as none of them have ever seen a magical beast in a human form before.

"By the way, this Phantom Cat is currently the strongest existence in this world, surpassing even Qiuyue in cultivation." Tang Lingxi suddenly said.

"The strongest in this world? Do you think we can meet this Xiao Rong?" Zhu Mengyi asked with her eyes flickering in excitement.

"She’s a little exhausted after my lesson, but with her cultivation base, she should recover in a few hours. I’ll summon her then so you can meet her," Su Yang said to them.

"Okay!"

A moment later, Su Yang continued to speak, "By the way, I have also given Qin Liangyu my Family Seal just now."

"Qin Liangyu? I guess she couldn’t wait any longer and wanted to make it official as soon as possible,’ Tang Lingxi chuckled.

"Qin Liangyu?" The three ladies raised their eyebrows again, as this is another name they are not familiar with.

Seeing this, Su Yang explained to them, "Qin Liangyu is someone from the Southern Continent— you’ll meet her later along with Xiao Rong."

"You have been to the Southern Continent too?" Lian Li raised her eyebrows, and then she asked, "Then have you gone to the Western or Northern Continent before?"

"No, I haven’t," he shook his head. "I don’t have any business there so I won’t even bother."

"Aren’t you at least curious though? I have always been curious about the other Continents," Lian Li then said. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

"If you want, I can fly you around the other continents once I am available," Su Yang said.

"Really?" Lian Li looked at him with a bright smile on her beautiful face.

"The two of you can have fun— I am going to stay here with Wu Min," Wu Jingjing said.

"Me, too. It’s not easy traveling with a baby," Zhu Mengyi sighed.

"Anyway, I was just telling them about the Divine Heavens. Care to join us, darling? Maybe you can share some of your experience?" Tang Lingxi asked him a moment later.

"My experience, huh?" Su Yang grabbed a chair and sat down with a pondering expression.

"Well? What do you want to know?"

Lian Li immediately raised her hands and said, "I want to know more about your title ’Spirit Heaven’s Sword Emperor’! How did you obtain such a title?"

"Hmm..." Su Yang closed his eyes to think for a minute before speaking, "Well, I kind of cultivated with the previous Sword Emperor’s wife which resulted in a deathmatch with the guy. After defeating him, I got his title of Sword Emperor."

"Eh?"

Lian Li and the other ladies looked at him with their eyes wide with shock. Only Tang Lingxi was chuckling from the story behind his title, as she already knew about it.

"As for the Spirit Heaven part— because it took place in the Spirit Heaven, one of the four Divine Heavens," Su Yang added.

"W-What about your journey as a swordmaster? Why did you choose the sword in the first place?" Lian Li asked a few moments later.

"Because my first love— my first wife who was a general wielded a sword in her battles, and I looked up to her," Su Yang said with a warm smile on his face as he recalled Su Meiqi’s heroic figure after the wars she fought.

"Once I began training with the sword, I realized just how much I liked its style, so I continued to practice it until I reached the peak with it."

"The peak... so you were the strongest swordmaster in your previous life?" Lian Li asked him.

"Haha... Far from it," Su Yang shook his head, and he said, "While my techniques were definitely at the peak during my era, there are many more swordmasters out there who are more powerful than me, as I have stopped practicing the sword to become a Dual Cultivator."

"Perhaps if I didn’t stop training with a sword, I might have become the strongest swordmaster out there and obtained the title of Sword God."

"Sword God..." Lian Li mumbled, and she asked, "Do you regret abandoning the sword path?"

Su Yang laughed for a moment before shaking his head, "Regrets? I have none! If I didn’t become a Dual Cultivator, I wouldn’t have met any of you or my other partners! If I could go back in time and redo everything, I would actually become a Dual Cultivator again but even earlier in my life!"
