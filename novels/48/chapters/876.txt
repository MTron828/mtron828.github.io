Chapter 877 - Four Divine Heavens' Economy

"The Jade Heaven, huh? I will keep that in mind. And speaking of wealth, how different is it in the Divine Heavens compared to this place when it comes to their economy?" Xian Ni asked.

"It’s entirely different. While they also have spirit stones and still use them as currencies, it’s only worth as much as coins do to mortals in this world in the Four Divine Heavens. In other words, mortals use spirit stones as if they are coins over there whilst spirit stones are worth a fortune to mortals in this world."

"What the heck? Then what do Cultivators use?" Xian Ni asked.

"Spirit stones, but a different kind."

Su Yang then retrieved a spirit stone and showed it to him, "Imagine this tiny spirit stone a little bigger, and it contains enough spiritual energy to make a Cultivator at the Elementary Spirit Realm reach the Heavenly Spirit Realm before running out of spiritual energy."

Xian Ni’s jaw dropped. How can such spirit stones possibly exist?

"There are ordinary spirit stones in the Divine Heavens, and then there are medium-grade spirit stones, high-grade spirit stones, and flawless spirit stones. Of course, the higher grade the spirit stone the more it’s worth. For comparison, one medium-grade spirit stone is worth about 10,000 ordinary low-grade spirit stones, and one high-grade spirit stone is worth 10,000 medium-grade spirit stones."

"Heavens..." Xian Ni mumbled in a dazed voice.

"There are also these things called Spirit Jades used as currencies, and they are as valuable as spirit stones are to mortals in this world. Even a single low-grade Spirit Jade is worth as much as 100,000 flawless spirit stones. They are usually used to exchange for extremely valuable treasures that cannot be paid in spirit stones since it’ll cost too much." Su Yang explained the economy to Xian Ni, who was left speechless by such knowledge.

"Anyways, that’s the gist of the economy in the Four Divine Heavens. There are other things used as currencies, but spirit stones and spirit jades are the norms."

"Now, onto the Spirit Heaven, which is ranked second. The way this place differs from the others is the people living in this world."

"People?" Xian Ni raised his eyebrows.

"When I say people, they’re not really humans. Magical beasts, divine beasts, and even demons... The Spirit Heaven is occupied by mostly these kinds of existences." Su Yang explained.

"In other words, Spirit Heaven is the home of magical beasts and the likes, and the majority of them take on the form of humans to make things more convenient for them."

"I see... I have seen a couple of magical beasts transforming into humans before, but I can count them on one hand, so an entire world of them... I cannot imagine." Xian Ni said.

Su Yang smiled, and he continued, "Next is the Martial Heaven, and they are ranked first in terms of overall prowess. If you’re looking for talented Cultivators, that’s where you go, as that’s where all of the best talents in the Four Divine Heavens seemingly gather."

"If you want to become the strongest out there, that’ll also be your destination."

Xian Ni immediately smiled and said, "So you’re telling me to go to the Martial Heaven?"

Su Yang nodded, "If you want to learn from the best, that is where you should go. From Qi Refiners to Body Refiners to Alchemy Masters and Dual Cultivators, the Martial Heaven has it all. Not only are they the most diverse but they are also the strongest. I will personally be going there to increase my cultivation once I find a place to settle down with my family."

And he continued, "However, we don’t know where the treasure will take us, nor can we control it. We might land in any of the Four Divine Heavens, or we might land somewhere else that’s not related to the Four Divine Heavens."

"Let’s say we land in the Spirit Heaven. How do we travel to another Divine Heaven?" Xian Ni asked.

"There will be teleport formations in most major cities that can take you to the other Divine Heavens, almost like the ones in this world. Of course, they’re much more powerful and will cost you even more spirit stones." Su Yang said.

"The Four Divine Heavens are by no means close to each other. It’ll take you more than just a few million spirit stones to use it."

"How much does it usually cost?"

Su Yang pondered for a moment before speaking, "It varies depending on where you’re going and your location before the teleport, but it’s going to cost you at least a few hundred thousand high-grade spirit stones."

Xian Ni’s jaw dropped upon hearing that enormous amount.

If a single high-grade spirit stone is worth 10,000 medium-grade, and 1 medium-grade is worth 10,000 ordinary spirit stones, it would cost at least a few trillions of spirit stones to use the teleport formation! It was an astronomical amount that he couldn’t even fathom!

"Heavens, I hope we’ll get teleported directly to the Martial Heaven... It’ll probably take me the rest of my life to collect that much— In fact, I will probably die long before then." Xian Ni sighed.

"Don’t worry, it may seem like a lot to you right now, but once you get used to life in the Divine Heavens, 100,000 high-grade spirit stones— even a few million won’t appear to be that much."

"I hope so..." Xian Ni sighed, feeling his confidence shattering even before he arrived at the Divine Heavens. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

"Who knows, maybe you’ll have a fortunate encounter and obtain some valuable treasure that’ll pay for your trip and more." Su Yang chuckled.

"That sounds like a joke, but in the cultivation world, that isn’t too far-fetched. In fact, it’s entirely possible." Xian Ni shook his head with a smile.

Sometime later, Xian Ni asked, "Tell me more about the Celestial Heaven. You were born there, right?"

Su Yang nodded, "But there’s nothing really special about the Celestial Heaven. It’s like your standard cultivation world but much larger, I guess."
