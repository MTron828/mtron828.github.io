Chapter 740 Liquid of Fertility

After leaving Bai Lihua’s house and the Heavenly Swan Sect, Su Yang went to the Cai Family to pick up Cai Yan.

Before Su Yang’s arrival, Cai Yan’s parents approached her, who was peacefully studying the technique Su Yang gave her to pass time until he picked her up.

"Mother? Father? Do you need something from me?" Cai Yan lowered the scroll to look at them.

Their parents looked at each other for a moment before Cai Yan’s mother extended her arms with a smile on her face and a small box in her grasp.

"Here, Yan’er. This is a gift for you," she said to her.

"What is it?" Cai Yan accepted the box with a curious look on her face.

Hearing her question, her father spoke, "It’s a medicine known as Liquid of Fertility, and it’ll greatly enhance your chances of being fertilized. Drink it before you do ’that’ with Su Yang, and make sure he releases his white stuff inside your body."

"You... You want me to conceive a child with Su Yang?" Cai Yan looked at her parents with a speechless expression on her face, seemingly in disbelief. Never in her life did she expect her parents to be so supportive— even aggressive for her, especially when it was related with another man, as they would usually keep her away from other men.

"Of course we would want to see our grandchildren! Aren’t you and Su Yang partners? What’s wrong with bearing his child? You’re already a woman, Yan’er. Most women around your age have already experienced giving birth."

"B-But this is too sudden... And Su Yang and I aren’t really like that..." Cai Yan said to them in a dumbfounded voice.

"You’re not? Then what are you two? Don’t tell me you’re giving your body to a man you have no relationship with— that you don’t even love?" Her mother quickly frowned.

"Well..."

Since she didn’t want to explain to them, Cai Yan said, "I understand... I will ask Su Yang if he wants to conceive a child with me..."

Sometime later, Su Yang arrived at the Cai Family.

"Welcome, Su Yang. Our daughter is already prepared to head to the Profound Blossom Sect with you." Cai Yan’s mother greeted him at the door.

A few moments later, Cai Yan appeared before him.

"Please take care of our daughter, Su Yang," Cai Yan’s parents lowered their bodies to bow to him.

"Please take care of me, Master..." Cai Yan followed her parents and bowed to him.

Su Yang nodded and said, "Don’t worry, I won’t treat her any less than perfect."

Sometime later, Su Yang boarded the flying boat with Cai Yan before returning to the Profound Blossom Sect.

Once they had arrived at the Profound Blossom Sect, Su Yang showed Cai Yan her living quarters and said, "This will be your new home for now until you decide to leave."

"Thank you, Master." Cai Yan bowed to him again.

"If you are ready to begin cultivating, just let me know," Su Yang said.

After a moment of silence, Cai Yan said, "I am ready to cultivate now, Master."

However, Su Yang said to her with an apologetic look on his face, "I’m sorry, but I have already appointments with other disciples, and it’ll take at least 6 hours. I’ll come to see you as soon as I am done with the others."

Cai Yan nodded and said, "Don’t worry about it, Master. There’s no need to apologize since it was my decision to come here."

"Then I’ll see you in a few hours."

After Su Yang left, Cai Yan settled down in her new home and took some time to familiarize herself with the new scenery and environment before she started studying the alchemy technique again.

Time passed by in a flash and before she knew it, many hours had passed, and Su Yang returned to her living quarters.

"We can do this tomorrow if you’d like, Master. It’s already getting dark, and you have already been cultivating for the entire day," Cai Yan said to him.

Su Yang chuckled before speaking, "I do this for a living— there’s no way a few hours with the disciples would tire me out." ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Hearing his words, Cai Yan nodded and said, "Please come inside, Master."

Sometime later, they entered Cai Yan’s room that was already filled with her unique scent.

"Um... Master... I have something to ask of you..." Cai Yan suddenly said to him after they sat down on the bed, acting a little fidgety and out of character.

Su Yang looked at her with a smile and said, "You don’t need to tell me anything, I already know about the Liquid of Fertility that’s inside your robes. Did your parents tell you to bear my child?"

Cai Yan looked at him with a surprised face before nodding her head in a dazed manner.

"Y-Yes... They did... But how did you...?"

"The Liquid of Fertility has quite the strong smell, after all. I have known about it ever since I picked you up," Su Yang said with a smile on his face.

"S-Since that long?" Cai Yan’s jaw dropped wide open.

After a moment of silence, Cai Yan spoke, "Then... do you think you’ll be able to...? I completely understand if you don’t want to since I am only your disciple and we’re doing this to improve my cultivation..."

After another moment of silence, Su Yang spoke, "I don’t mind."

"R-Really?" Cai Yan looked at him with wide eyes.

Su Yang nodded and continued, "But I won’t be by your side forever, so if you don’t mind bearing my child while knowing that I won’t be able to take care of it, I’ll agree to your request."

"..." Cai Yan became silent.

After a long moment of silence, Cai Yan nodded with a resolute expression on her face, "This is mostly my parents’ wish because they want an heir for the family, and they’ll probably want to raise the child by themselves anyway, and I want to focus on alchemy. Therefore, I won’t ask you to take responsibility."
