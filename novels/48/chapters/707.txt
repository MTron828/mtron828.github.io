Chapter 708 - Penetrating Xie Xingfang

"Let me make this a little bit more comfortable for us," Su Yang said to Xie Xingfang once they were inside the clouds, and he retrieved a small but comfortable mattress before placing it on top of the flying boat.

"Do you always carry a mattress around with you?" Xie Xingfang looked at him with admiration in her gaze, feeling slightly baffled by his commitment and dedication.

"Of course. You never know when you’ll need it with today as an example," Su Yang said with a smile as he laid her body on the mattress.

"Su Yang... I don’t think I have the strength to remove my clothes... can you help me?" Xie Xingfang asked him with her face still blushing.

"With pleasure..."

Su Yang loosened her robes and spread them over the mattress like a blanket.

"What do you think...?" Xie Xingfang asked him afterward with her face flushed with redness and her legs closed from embarrassment.

"It’s beautiful," Su Yang said as his gaze gently looked at Xie Xingfang’s perfectly slim body and flawless snow-white skin that resembled white jade, feeling as though he was looking at a graceful fairy who belonged to a masterpiece painting.

His hands then gently caressed her body from between her b.r.e.a.s.ts until it reached her clean and hairless cave.

"Let me please you for a bit," Su Yang then kneeled on the mattress and lifted Xie Xingfang’s body and pulled her closer to his body before placing her soft thighs on his shoulders and her cave directly in front of his mouth.

"T-This is..." Xie Xingfang’s heart palpitated loudly and crazily, feeling as though there was a war drum being played in her heart.

Once she was in position, Su Yang used his fingers to spread open the small slit between her legs, revealing the pretty and cute pink meat inside, and without further ado, he immediately began teasing it with his tongue.

"Aaaah~!"

Xie Xingfang’s body immediately tightened up with her legs tightly wrapped behind Su Yang’s body.

However, a few moments later, once her body began familiarizing itself with the feeling, her body naturally relaxed.

"Mmm~"

"Aaaahn~!"

"Aaaahhh~!"

Xie Xingfang m.o.a.ned softly as Su Yang licked and kissed her little sister for many minutes, and her body would constantly tremble in delight, even releasing these milky substances in small but constant amounts.

After spending many minutes tasting Xie Xingfang’s pink meat and savoring her rich and milky Yin Qi, Su Yang laid her body back on the mattress before he began removing his clothes.

’This is a man— Su Yang’s...’ Xie Xingfang intensely stared at Su Yang’s raging dragon that was thick, long, and rock hard.

Seeing Xie Xingfang’s enchanted expression, Su Yang stood up and said to her, "Go ahead, it won’t bite."

Xie Xingfang nodded and kneeled before his rod. Once it was directly before her curious face, she gently grabbed it as though it was a fragile treasure, and she began licking the tip with her wet and small tongue, tasting the sweet and sticky substance that was oozing out from the hole.

’It’s so stiff and hot... it looks painful...’ Xie Xingfang thought to herself as she slowly savored his rod.

A few minutes later, Xie Xingfang opened her small mouth and tried to put the entire rod into her mouth, but alas, she was only able to manage to fit half of it inside her mouth, and she began to stroke her head in a graceful manner.

Because she was afraid of hurting Su Yang, Xie Xingfang made sure her every movement was made with consideration whilst trying her best to please him despite her lack of experience and knowledge.

"Do you want to taste my Yang Qi?" Su Yang asked her.

Xie Xingfang looked at him from below and gently nodded her head with his rod still in his mouth, looking very seducing and s.e.xy.

A few moments later, Su Yang slowly released his Yang Qi so that he doesn’t overwhelm Xie Xingfang, who was much more delicate than his other partners.

’What an indescribable but pleasant taste...’ Xie Xingfang closed her eyes and savored the Yang Qi that was being fed to her through Su Yang’s straw.

After swallowing a mouthful of Yang Qi in small quantities, Xie Xingfang finally removed her mouth from his rod, allowing it to feel the cool breeze once again.

"Both of our bodies are ready— are you?" Su Yang asked her afterward.

"I am." Xie Xingfang nodded, and she continued, "Please make love with me, Su Yang..."

Hearing Xie Xingfang’s yearning voice, Su Yang kneeled on the mattress again before pulling her towards his body— until his thick rod was poking the sealed entrance between her legs.

"It’s going to be painful at first because your hole is smaller than normal. However, if you want, I can help you relieve that pain with a special technique," Su Yang suddenly said to her.

"No, it’s okay. I want to experience this as intended. Even if it’s painful, I want to experience it, so that I won’t mistake this as a dream..."

"Okay," Su Yang nodded.

A few seconds later, he began pushing his wet rod into her small and slippery entrance.

’It hurts!’ Xie Xingfang cried inwardly as she tightly clenched her jaws together to try and ease the intense pain coming from between her legs, and fresh blood was already flowing from her cave after accepting just the tip of Su Yang’s sword.

’What a tight hole!’ Su Yang thought to himself as tore her inner walls apart, feeling a crushing sensation around his meatstick. Although he could use the Myriad Transformation to adjust his sword to fit into Xie Xingfang’s hole better, that would be disrespectful to Xie Xingfang, who wanted to accept him as who he is.

A few moments later, Su Yang finally stopped, as he’d reached the end of her small and narrow cave. However, Su Yang was unable to fit his entire shaft into Xie Xingfang’s body, as there was about an inch of free space left.
