Chapter 909 - Celestial Sword Sect

"You don’t know what happened to the Celestial Sword Sect?" Feng Yan looked at Su Yang with a surprised expression.

Even the ordinary cultivators from the other Divine Heavens have heard about the incident, yet this fatty who has the capability to use Sword Will isn’t aware of the incident that occurred to one of the top sword sects in the Celestial Heaven?​​Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Feng Yan suddenly showed a smile on her face, and she said, "If I tell you what happened, you must tell me how you learned your Sword Will!"

Su Yang nodded without hesitation.

Feng Yan then said, "The Celestial Sword Sect lost to the Limitless Sword Sect in a contest where the winner gets to command the loser to do anything, and the Limitless Sword Sect forced all of the Swordmasters in the Celestial Sword Sect to leave the sect and forbid future Swordmasters from existing in the Celestial Sword Sect again, essentially killing the sect."

"What?" Su Yang was dumbfounded and speechless after hearing about this.

"What about the Sect Master?" he then asked.

"The previous Sect Master had to be replaced by someone who wasn’t a Swordmaster."

"The Celestial Sword Sect is still standing even after all of the Swordmasters left? How is that possible?" Su Yang couldn’t understand this part.

After all, a sword sect without any Swordmasters is just an ordinary sect.

"That’s because even though the Swordmasters are forced to leave the sect, they are still allowed to support the sect individually. Furthermore, the sword techniques in the Celestial Sword Sect were left untouched, so while the sect is no longer the same, there are still many disciples there."

After pondering for a moment, Su Yang then asked, "What happens to the disciples that become Swordmasters?"

"Once a disciple of the Celestial Sword Sect becomes an official Swordmaster, they must leave the sect. However, not all hope is lost, as these new Swordmasters can continue to train under the tutelage of the elders and masters that were forced to leave the sect. They just won’t be part of the sect any longer."

"So the previous sect elders are acting as individual Swordmasters, accepting these new Swordmasters as disciples after they leave the sect? Heavens... What on earth is happening to the Celestial Heaven? Everything is a mess..." Su Yang mumbled in a low voice.

"I have told you everything. Now you tell me about your Sword Will! Who is your master?" Feng Yan asked him afterward.

"..."

After a moment of silence, Su Yang said, "Fei Wenxia."

Feng Yan’s eyes widened with shock upon hearing the name of the previous Sect Master of the Celestial Sword Sect.

"You’re the old Sect Master’s disciple?!" Feng Yan exclaimed.

"I used to be— yes." Su Yang confirmed.

"U-Unbelievable... No wonder you know Sword Will!"

"Before I leave, why did the Limitless Sword Sect and the Celestial Sword Sect decide to fight each other? I know they’ve always disliked each other because of their differences in sword technique, but there’s no reason for them to clash against each other like this." Su Yang suddenly asked her.

"Hm? I’m not so sure about the details myself, but according to rumors, it was because the Limitless Sword Sect had insulted a disciple of the Celestial Sword Sect, and this disciple used to be the pride of the sect. I forgot his name, but I think the person’s surname was ’Su’..."

The Limitless Sword Sect used him to provoke the Celestial Sword Sect? And the Celestial Sword Sect fought them in response? How should he even react to this?

"Anyway, thank you for the information. I really have to go now." Su Yang said to Feng Yan before flying away with Xiao Rong.

Feng Yan didn’t chase after him this time, and she returned to training with the sword.

Once they were alone, Su Yang said, "After Meiqi’s death, I tried to fill the hole in my heart by training with the sword— the weapon she loved the most, and that worked temporarily, as I would forget about my loneliness when I absorbed myself in training."

"I joined the Celestial Sword Sect during this time, and in the sect, my sword techniques improved by leaps and bounds. If it were not for the Celestial Sword Sect, I probably wouldn’t have reached where I currently am with the sword."

"Fei Wenxia was the Sect Master of the Celestial Sword Sect when I was still a disciple there, and he held the title of Celestial Heaven’s Sword Emperor during that time. I cannot believe that someone like him was forced to leave the sect." Su Yang sighed, giving Xiao Rong some of his background and history with the Celestial Sword Sect.

"As for the Limitless Sword Sect, they would always try to convince me to abandon the Celestial Sword Sect to join them, and when I refused, their jealousy for the Celestial Sword Sect would intensify alongside their hate. After all, I was regarded as the most talented Swordmasters during that era, and because of my influence, the Celestial Sword Sect received the title of Number One Sword Sect in the Celestial Heaven, something the Limitless Sword Sect coveted greatly."

"I stopped paying attention to the Celestial Sword Sect and the world of Swordmasters after I left the sect and began my journey as a Dual Cultivator, but I can never forget my debt to them. When I get the chance, I will see if there’s anything I can do to help the Celestial Sword Sect return to their former glory."

During the rest of their journey in the canyon, Su Yang would talk about his time as a disciple in the Celestial Sword Sect, and Xiao Rong would listen with great interest. After all, Su Yang normally doesn’t talk about his past, and when he does, he wouldn’t say more than just a few words.
