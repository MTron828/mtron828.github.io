"The Root of Revival...?" Xian Hantian immediately frowned, and he spoke after a moment of silence, "I’m sorry, but that isn’t possible..."

"Why not?" Su Yang asked him with raised eyebrows, remaining tranquil.

"You better explain yourself, Hantian..." Xian Ni narrowed his eyes at Xuan Hantian, who immediately explained himself.

"It’s impossible not because I don’t want to exchange the Root of Revival. It’s impossible because I’d already donated the Root of Revival to the Immortal Association, who will be using the Root of Revival as a reward for their tournament."

"Immortal Association? Tournament?" Su Yang raised his eyebrows.

Xian Hantian nodded and said, "The Immortal Association is one of the largest alliances in this world with all nine Immortal Families managing in it, and they host a massive tournament once every 10 years. I’d donated the Root of Revival to them a little over 4 years ago, and they will be giving it along with a few other things to the winner of the tournament that will occur in three days."

"I see..." Su Yang nodded calmly.

"Daoist Su Yang, since the tournament hasn’t begun, we can still ask the Immortal Association for the Root of Revival." Xian Ni said to him afterward.

"Yes, let’s give them a visit now." Su Yang agreed.

"I am really sorry for this... If I’d known about this, I wouldn’t have given it to them..." Xian Hantian apologized to Su Yang despite not being at fault and mostly because he was afraid of Xian Ni.

Su Yang shook his head and said, "Don’t worry about it, I am not an unreasonable person, and I don’t expect anyone to have the ability to see the future, so there’s no need for you to apologize to me."

"Let’s go." Su Yang said as he walked out the door.

Sometime later, once they were outside again, Xian Ni said, "Last time I checked, the Immortal Association was in this city and isn’t very far away from this location so we don’t need to use the flying treasure."

Su Yang nodded and said, "Lead the way."

Xian Ni then flew away, and Su Yang and his group followed him from behind.

A few minutes later, they arrived before this massive pagoda that had the words ’Immortal Association’ grandly displayed on a golden sign in all four directions.

"W-Who are those people? They’re emitting such a powerful aura! I have never felt anything so profound before!"

"Good heavens! Look at those two beauties! I have never seen anything even half as beautiful as them! They’re true fairies! Real goddesses!"

The pedestrians were immediately attracted by Xian Ni’s and Su Yang’s unfathomable aura as well as the two goddesses’ peerless beauty.

"How may the Immortal Association help you today, esteemed guests?" The worker inside the building also noticed their enormous presence and immediately approached them.

"I am here to speak to your head, Cang Shicai— that is if he’s still the head manager of this place," Xian Ni said as he pulled out his authority medallion, shocking the worker.

"The Xian Family’s Immortal Medallion!" The worker cried out loud after seeing this majesty medallion in Xian Ni’s hands, as it was something only the emperor, Xian Hantian, and one other person would have— the Ancestor of the Xian Family who is also the number one expert in this world!

"P-Please follow me, Your Majesty!"

The worker bowed to him before turning around and walking in a stiff manner.

A few minutes later, they were brought to the highest floor in the pagoda where a single room existed.

"Senior Cang! You have guests!" The worker knocked on the door while shouting.

A moment later, a loud voice resounded, "Guests? I don’t recall having scheduled appointments today! If there’s no appointment, I won’t see them! Send them away!"

The worker would normally listen to Senior Cang’s words, but the person visiting today was the Ancestor of the Xian Family. There was simply no way he could send such a legendary figure away even if he was beaten to death.

"B-But Senior Cang! The guests are—"

"Did you not hear me just now?! I will not repeat myself for the third time! SEND! THEM! AWAY!" Senior Cang shouted from inside the room, sounding irritated.

Xian Ni shook his head at this, and he took a step forward before kicking the doors down and shouting back, "Who the f.u.c.k do you think you’re trying to send away, you damn old man!"

"Y-You are?! Ancestor Xian?!"

The old man sitting behind the desk inside the room immediately stood up from shock after seeing Xian Ni’s face and muscular body.

"W-What are you doing here? If I’d known it was you, I would’ve—"

"Ah, cut the crap, old man. I don’t have the time to entertain you today since I am not alone." Xian Ni said as he pointed at Su Yang with his gaze.

"Who are they?" Senior Cang looked at Su Yang and the beauties behind him with wide eyes.

"They’re my friends from another continent, and they’re here regarding something my family handed you four years ago— the Root of Revival. Do you still have it?" Xian Ni asked him.

"A-Another continent? How is that possible with the Jade Sea... Ah, forget it." Senior Cang shook his head before continuing, "Anyway, the Root of Revival, right? Yes, I still have it. After all, it’s one of the grand prizes for this year’s tournament."

"Well, he needs it, and he’s willing to exchange his treasures for it." Xian Ni said.

However, Senior Cang shook his head and said, "Although I may be the head manager, I cannot make such a big decision without the Nine Immortal Families’ approval as well, as this rule is what keeps this place from collapsing."

"What if I say I want the Root of Revival— are you going to refuse me?" Xian Ni suddenly said with an overbearing pressure coming from him.

"A-Ancestor Xian... please don’t make things difficult for me... When have I ever offended you?" Senior Cang sighed.
