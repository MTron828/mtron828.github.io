After hearing Wang Shuren’s friendly warning, which basically told her to never betray Su Yang or else she will greatly regret it, Bai Lihua pondered in silence why she would say such a thing.

’She didn’t mention the Profound Blossom Sect, nor did she bother with whoever may be backing him. Su Yang... just what is so special about him besides his glib tongue and handsome face?’

Bai Lihua couldn’t comprehend why Wang Shuren is being so loyal and respectful to a mere youngster who is only at the age of 17, especially when she’s cultivated for longer than he’s even been alive.

Bai Lihua narrowed her eyes at Su Yang, who was casually watching the matches with a relaxed expression.

Sometime later, Zi Dong raised his hands and announced with excitement, "The Profound Blossom Sect has managed to achieve 9 victories in a row against the Yellow River Sect, securing their spot in tomorrow’s matches! Congratulations!"

"Good work, you girls." Liu Lanzhi said to them with a huge smile on her face.

Never in a hundred years did she expect the Profound Blossom Sect to win against the Yellow River Sect, much less last this long in the tournament. Not to mention the current state of their sect. In fact, this is the first time in their sect’s history that they have lasted for more than one day in the tournament.

"I didn’t get a chance to enter the stage in the end..." Sun Jingjing sighed at the fact that she wasn’t able to fight today.

"With that being said, that just means my fellow sisters are that competent," she said a moment later.

Meanwhile, most of the Yellow River Sect disciples appeared to be in despair after their loss, as it had never crossed their minds that they could possibly lose to an inferior Sect such as the Profound Blossom Sect. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

’Not just this Jin Xi, but I don’t recognize every disciple that came afterward! There’s no way that I would not know of their names if they are this powerful! Did they join the Profound Blossom Sect after everyone left?’

It was the only explanation that made sense in Li Xiao Mo’s mind.

’That must be it! How else do you explain such a situation? Even the Core disciples that were there before they all left weren’t as strong as them!’

After the match ended, both the Yellow River Sect and the Profound Blossom Sect gathered in the center, and the Sect Masters bowed to each other to show respect to each other regardless of the results.

However, before they went their own ways, Su Yang said to Li Xiao Mo, "I can tell that you are puzzled so allow me to help you understand it. All of the disciples that went on the stage today used to be ordinary Outer Court disciples before they disperse, so it’s not odd that you don’t recognize any of them."

"W-What?" Li Xiao Mo stared at them with a dumbfounded expression after hearing Su Yang’s words.

However, Su Yang continued to speak, "And I personally trained them."

"?!?!"

Li Xiao Mo’s beautiful face instantly filled itself with shock and disbelief.

"I see..." she mumbled a few moments later with a bitter smile on her face. "To tell you the truth, when I couldn’t find you at that time, I had figured that you had already left the Profound Blossom Sect, so I also decided to leave. But alas, to think you actually remained. I should have waited a little bit longer before deciding."

Because Su Yang was absent from the place where all of the disciples were supposed to be gathered, Li Xiao Mo had assumed that Su Yang had already left the Profound Blossom Sect, hence why she left them.

However, although it was only for a brief moment, Su Yang was indeed at the center court with the other disciples. Unfortunately for Li Xiao Mo, he was not near her, and he left before she could even see him.

’If I had remained at the Profound Blossom Sect, maybe I would be standing by his side right now with a blissful smile, but alas...’ Li Xiao Mo wondered as she shook her head, before leaving with the Yellow River Sect.

"Don’t you just feel bad for her when you look at the painful expression on her face?" Sun Jingjing mumbled.

"No matter her reason, it remains a fact that she’d abandoned the Profound Blossom Sect and its disciples." Fang Zhelan said with a nonchalant expression.

Once the Yellow River Sect began walking away, the Profound Blossom Sect also turned around.

However, before they could walk off the stage, a graceful figure in lavish clothing suddenly stood up from her seat and approached them.

Once the Profound Blossom Sect realized who stood before them, all of them immediately bowed to her and spoke in a respectful tone, "Your Highness."

When the spectators saw this, their eyes widened with shock. Why would Xie Xingfang suddenly approach them? This is the first time she’s left her seat in the middle of the tournament!

"..."

All of the disciples, especially Liu Lanzhi, anxiously waited for Xie Xingfang to speak, as they were all wondering why she would approach them.

"Congratulations on winning the match." Xie Xingfang’s gentle voice resounded a few moments later.

"?!?!"

Liu Lanzhi did not know how to react and silently stared at Xie Xingfang with a dumbfounded gaze. The princess took all that effort to approach them just to congratulate them? And why did she choose to congratulate them but ignore everybody else?

"Thank you, but we are not worthy of your praises just yet." While Liu Lanzhi was in her trance, Su Yang said to her with a smile on his face. "Come back and repeat those words once we take the first place."

When the people heard Su Yang’s words, they all gasped in shock.

"Her Highness personally praised them and he has the audacity to tell her to come back later?!"

"This arrogant bastard thinks they will win the regional tournament! Hahaha!"

"His face has been irritating me ever since I saw him! Somebody needs to rough it up a bit!"

The spectators began cursing at Su Yang loudly, but he acted as though he couldn’t hear them and continued smiling at Xie Xingfang.
