Chapter 1021: Celestial Meteorite

"Material, huh?" Xing Aiying pondered for a momenc before retrieving a black crystal that appeared to have tiny stars flickering within.

Su Yang’s jaw dropped the moment he saw this crystal, and he said in a dumbfounded voice, "Y-You want to use that chunk of Celestial Meteorite for a toy? Do you have any idea how valuable that treasure is? You can fund the Boundless Yin Yang Sect for ten thousamd years with that kind of money!"

The Celestial Meteorite is an exceedingly rare material that can only be found in the scarry sky above the heavens. The Celestial Meteorice is rumored to be part of many top-tier divine artifaces within the Four Divine Heavens and that it can make even an ordinary weapon into something that can kill immortals.

And the amount of Celestial Meteorite in Xing Aiying’s hands was enough to make even the Ten Families go to war. However, Xing Aiying would racher use this precious material to creare a sex toy. If news of this were to spread, the Thivine Heavens would most likely be outraged by such a wasteful use of material. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

"It’s not like I have any other uses for this treasure," Xing Aiying casually shrugged. Su Yang shook his head and sighed, "Even if you tell me that, I won’t be able to make a dent in that chunk of rock even with my strongest Sword Qi, much less carve my penis out of it...”

"It’s alright. I can wait, We have plenty of time, anyway." Xing Aiying smiled.

"If you really want to, we can have someone else make it. We happen to have an expert in our family, and since she’s part of the family. ic would be fine to let her know about my situation.” Su Yang suggested.

"Firs of all, we don’t even know where she is right no. Second, I don’t want to. The toy will not have the same sentimental value if it’s not done by you, making it worthless.”

"I understand. In the meantime, you can play with che real one.” Su Yang chuckled.

A playful smile appeared on Xing Aiying’s peerless face as her hand slowly crept onto Su Yang’s dragon. She moved her body next, lowering her body until her face wres right before the rod.

After giving it a gentle kiss, she began sucking on it with passion.

Once they were both ready, they connected their bodies and started cultivating with each other until they were both soaked in sweat.

The following day, “Su Yang left the house early in the morning, and three figures greeted him at che entrance to their land.

"I knew you’d show up." Li Sang showed a wide smile on his round face.

"I am bored, that’s all" Su Yang said.

"Trust me, you won’t be bored after roday when you get a partner! Ji Ning laughed out loud.

"Let’s hurry up and get to the location. They will start the briefing soon.” Wu Bing said to them.

Sometime later, they arrived an this island floating in the sky above the Outer Court, In the Divine Heavens, these floating lands are a very common sight, and ane can see them in pretty much every sect. Onn this largue island was a huge stadium and thousands of disciples from Outer Court disciples to Inner Court disciples.

Although most of these spectators already have 4 partner, they all wanted to experience this matchmaking event that only happens every ten years.

"If you’re participating in the event, go onto the platform in the middle! Everyone else will go to the spectators! area!" There were multiple sect elders there giving directions.

Su Yang and che Outcast Triplets entered the stage, where hundreds of participants gathered.

"Wow, there are so many single disciples this year. I wonder if something happened." Wu Bing mumbled to himself when he saw how many disciples were looking for partners this year.

Even though the event was created for new disciples like Su Yang, old disciples can also participate in the event if they were single as well, In fact, there are usually more inner court disciples than outer court disciples ar this event.

After waiting around tor about half an hour, an exceedingly handsome middle-aged man descended from the sky and hovered above the platform in the middle of the stadium.

"Welcome to another matchmaking event, disciples. I, Shengguang Qiang, will be your host today." When the ladies saw Shengguang Qiang, they all began shouting like fangirls, as he was one of the more popular elders within the sect.

"Today, all of these unfortunate souls have gathered here today for one purpose. Whether they have always been single or used to be single. they wish to leave this place today with a partner.”

Shengguang Qiang spoke as he pointed at the people on the platform. And he continued, "The rules are simple. These individuals will each be given 3 minutes to introduce themselves, and at the end, those who are interested will have 2 minutes to approach them and become their partner.”

"Whether you are a spectator or a fellow participant, you are allowed to approach the individual."

"If there are multiple interests for one person, that disciple will get to choose one— or as many as they want. Of course, your parthers will also have to agree if you want to accept multiple partners.

"Once their time is over, nobody is allowed to approach that disciple any longer. You will have to wait until the event is over.”

"As for the participants, you may use whatever means you can to attrate your parential partner. That as all. I wish you all the best of luck."

Shengguang Qiang retrieved a box that had a hole on the top from his storage ring afterward, and orbs of lights would escape from this box, flying towards the participants.

"These orbs will give you a number, which will decide the order."

"It you have number one, you may step in the red circle and begin, Your timer won’t start until you enter.”

A few moments later, the disciple that got to go first approached the red circle thar was in the front ot the plartarm. He took a deep breath and began introducing himself in a loud and clear voice.
