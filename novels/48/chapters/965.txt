Chapter 966 Scarlet Phoenixes

"Hey." Su Yang approached the tall middle-aged man standing outside the building.

"Is there something wrong, esteemed guest? If this is about earlier, I apologize—"

"I don’t care about that," Su Yang interrupted him and said, "Mei Ying... I am buying her from you."

"E-Excuse me?" The man looked at him with wide eyes, clearly doubting his ears.

Su Yang then retrieved a high-grade spirit stone and showed it to the man. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

"This should be enough to buy Mei Ying from your store, right?"

The man’s jaw dropped at the sight of the high-grade spirit stone.

However, as much as he wanted to agree, he was unable to.

"I’m sorry, esteemed guest, but I do not have the authority to make that decision." The man shook his head.

"You’re not the owner of this place?" Su Yang raised his eyebrows.

"Unfortunately, I am only the manager of this brothel. The women are owned by another brothel, as this place is only a branch. If you want to buy Mei Ying, you’ll have to visit the Scarlet Phoenixes at the Red Light District."

"I understand." Su Yang then left the place and started making his way to the Red Light District that is known as the most popular district within the City of Pleasure due to its high-quality entertainers.

Once he arrived at the Red Light District, Su Yang could instantly see a difference in the atmosphere and environment. Compared to the Pink Light District that looks like an ordinary restaurant on a dirty street, the Red Light District looked more like a luxurious restaurant with dazzling furniture and decorations.

Furthermore, there were beautiful women standing in front of nearly every building he walked past.

"Excuse me, can you tell me where the Scarlet Phoenixes is located?" Su Yang asked a couple of pedestrians for directions.

"Oh, it’s right down this path if you walk 15 streets down."

"Thank you."

Once he had the directions, Su Yang walked straight to the place.

Fifteen minutes later, Su Yang stood before a majestic red building that had a red phoenix statue with its wings spread placed at the peak of the building.

"Hello, handsome. Are you looking to have some fun?" A beautiful woman wearing a revealing red robe approached Su Yang with a sexy smile on her face.

Su Yang looked at the woman with a calm gaze and said, "I want to see your boss."

The woman’s eyes widened, and she said, "Do you have a reservation with her? The boss doesn’t do walk-ins."

’The boss is a woman, huh?’ Su Yang thought to himself.

"This is business-related," he then said.

"Oh? Can you clarify?"

"I’d like to buy a woman from one of your branch locations," he explained.

"I see... Please follow me inside. I will speak with the boss."

Su Yang then followed the woman into a guest room.

"Can you tell me about yourself so that I can tell the boss?"

"Xiao Yang, owner of the Heavenly Massage in the Pink Light District."

’Heavenly Massage? I don’t recall this place in the Pink Light District. He must be new.’ The woman thought to herself.

Although the Heavenly Massage is incredibly famous within the Pink Light District, it was still unknown to the majority of the City of Pleasure, especially the Red Light District, which is at the center of the city whilst the Pink Light District was on the outside.

"Please give me a few minutes to speak with the boss."

After leaving Su Yang, the woman went to the top of the building and knocked on a door.

"Who is it?" A clear voice resounded.

"It’s me, Third Phoenix. There’s a guest who wishes to buy one of our girls from a branch location. His name is Xiao Yang, and he’s the owner of the Heavenly Massage."

The woman said, addressing herself as ’Third Phoenix’ since everyone working in the brothel was considered a ’phoenix’.

"Heavenly Massage? I have never heard of this place before. What about you?"

The door opened, and an extremely beautiful woman with long red hair and sharp phoenix eyes appeared before the woman.

"I haven’t heard of them either, so it must be pretty new."

The red-haired woman then said, "What do you think? Do you think he’s worth my time?"

The woman pondered for a moment before speaking, "He looks pretty ordinary and young on the surface, but there’s this unfathomable demeanor around him that I cannot describe. The way he looked at me also gave me chills for some reason."

"This is the first time I have seen you speak about someone in such a manner. Now I really want to meet him..." The red-haired woman licked her lips.

The woman then led her to the guest room.

Hearing the door open after a couple of knocks, Su Yang turned to look at the entrance, where the woman returned with a red-haired beauty.

"My name is Feng Tianwei, owner of the Scarlet Phoenix as well as multiple branches across the City of Pleasure. I heard you want to buy one of my small phoenixes?"

Su Yang nodded with a charming smile on his face, and he bowed to her in a respectful manner, "My name is Xiao Yang. I am the owner of Heavenly Massage, a newly opened massage parlor in the Pink Light District. I was fortunate enough to encounter a woman named Mei Ying working in the Pink Light District, and I have been captivated by her, so I have come here to buy her from you."

"The phoenixes working in the Pink Light District are all mortals, but that doesn’t mean they’ll be cheap. How much are you willing to pay?"

"I will leave that decision up to you, Madam Feng." Su Yang said, still with a friendly look on his face.

"What if I refuse?" Feng Tianwei then said.

"Then I will try to convince you to change your mind."

"Oh? And how are you going to do that?"

Su Yang suddenly narrowed his gaze on her, and he said, "I can see that your shoulders are a little stiff. How about a free shoulder massage?"

Feng Tianwei and the woman beside her were taken by surprise by his response.

"Hahaha! You’re going to convince me with a massage? You’re a funny one, Xiao Yang!" Feng Tianwei started laughing out loud.

"Well, it’s what I’m best at." Su Yang said.

Once Feng Tianwei stopped laughing a moment later, she walked to the chair and took a seat.

"You’re right. My shoulders have been a little stiff lately. Let me see how good your massage is. If it sucks, I will tear down your massage parlor, okay?"

Feng Tianwei’s words made it sound like she was joking, yet her tone was dead serious, and she even looked at Su Yang with a serious gaze.

It was clear to Su Yang that Feng Tianwei didn’t like people trying to buy her girls.

"Sure."

Su Yang responded in a calm voice as he approached her.

’Oh? So he’s willing to risk his business for this woman? I wonder who he wants so badly...’ Feng Tianwei wondered to herself.

Although Mei Ying technically belonged to her since she worked for one of her branches, Feng Tianwei didn’t actually personally hire Mei Ying, nor does she really communicate with the other locations that often.

In fact, even Mei Ying herself doesn’t know about Feng Tianwei’s existence, nor the fact that she was owned by Feng Tianwei despite working at that brothel for many years. However, this was pretty common within the City of Pleasure where branch locations are everywhere.

In the midst of Feng Tianwei’s thoughts, Su Yang started his massage on her shoulders.

"Ah~!"

Feng Tianwei suddenly released a soft moan when she felt a sudden wave of pleasure in her body, interrupting her thoughts.

Third Phoenix’s eyes widened with shock after hearing Feng Tianwei’s moan.

’D-Did she just moan? From a shoulder massage?’ Third Phoenix wondered to herself.

Feng Tianwei was also shocked that she’d actually moaned just now.

"T-That surprised me just now... Not bad..." she said a moment later in a somewhat stiff voice.

"I’m glad that you like it." Su Yang said as he slowly increased the intensity of his massage.

Feng Tianwei tightened her jaw trying not to moan again, but the shoulder massage felt too good.

’How is a shoulder massage affecting my whole body?! I have never experienced anything like this before!’ Feng Tianwei cried inwardly.

"T-Third Phoenix... Can you go ask around about this Heavenly Massage?" Feng Tianwei suddenly spoke to her using spiritual sense.

"I-I understand..."

Third Phoenix knew that this was only an excuse to make her leave the room, but she didn’t dare refuse and left the place shortly after.

Once they were alone, Feng Tianwei stopped forcing her mouth shut and loosened her jaws.

She started breathing heavily at first, but she eventually gave up and started moaning, and her body would tremble every time Su Yang pressed his fingers into her shoulder.

Meanwhile, Third Phoenix asked around to see if anyone had heard of a Heavenly Massage in the Pink Light District. Although her attempts were unsuccessful at first, she eventually found someone who had heard about it.

"The Heavenly Massage? It’s a newly opened massage parlor in the Pink Light District, but it’s been getting all of the attention lately, and from what I heard from my friend who went there, it was an unforgettable experience that left her body dehydrated due to how much she climaxed during the massage."

Third Phoenix was speechless after hearing this testimony, and her interest in this Heavenly Massage grew.
