Chapter 653 - Dragon's Breath

*Gulp*

Zhu Mengyi swallowed nervously at the sight of the mighty flaming dragon between Su Yang’s legs, looking like a dragon engulfed in fierce flames. She simply cannot imagine what would happen to her body if Su Yang were to stick that inside her body.

However, her curiosity and excitement for the unknown far surpassed her anxiousness and fear, creating a weird and indescribable feeling in her heart.

"I am going to stick it in you now," Su Yang warned her.

"Go ahead..." Zhu Mengyi nodded and stared at the flaming dragon that was slowly flying towards her cave with wide eyes, not daring to miss its entrance.

And right as the head of the flaming dragon reached the entrance to Zhu Mengyi’s cave, Su Yang suddenly rammed his entire shaft into Zhu Mengyi’s hole, taking her by surprise.

"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh~!"

Zhu Mengyi felt an indescribable mixed feeling of pleasure and pain that jolted her entire body with intense pleasure, causing her to m.o.a.n at the top of her lungs.

After penetrating Zhu Mengyi with his flaming dragon, Su Yang did not continue to move and instead silently stared Zhu Mengyi’s face that looked extremely vulgar at this moment.

"What do you think?" He asked her with a confident smile on his face.

"It’s... It’s... I..." Zhu Mengyi was speechless, as she couldn’t find any word to describe the pleasure she was feeling right now, or her mind was simply filled with so much pleasure that she couldn’t think properly.

However, while Zhu Mengyi could not respond with words, her body had the perfect response for Su Yang’s inquiry by gushing with Yin Qi without stopping, almost like a broken dam.

"Wow, there’s so much coming out..." Even Wu Jingjing was amazed by the amount being released by Zhu Mengyi.

Of course, despite being drenched and soaking wet from her Yin Qi, Su Yang’s meatstick remained burning with alchemy flames, even seemingly slightly fiercer than before, which only increased the pleasure felt by Zhu Mengyi.

A few moments later, once Zhu Mengyi’s body stopped climaxing, Su Yang grabbed her waist and lifted her body slightly off the bed, and he began pounding her wet cave with his flaming dragon.

"Aaaaaah~!"

Zhu Mengyi’s little sister immediately began flowing with Yin Qi again, and Su Yang could feel her inner walls becoming tighter and tighter with every thrust.

"Aaaah~!"

"Aaahhhhh!"

"Aaaaaahhhh~!"

Zhu Mengyi could feel a distinct burning sensation inside her body that greatly enhanced the feeling of pleasure she was receiving; it was so intense that it felt like she was a pill that was being cooked inside a cauldron.

However, no matter how hot her body burned, she did not feel the slightest pain the entire time, only feeling pleasure and satisfaction from it.

"Get ready, I am going to release it now," Su Yang suddenly said to her after many minutes of cultivation.

The next moment, Su Yang released his Yang Qi into her body. However, there was something different about his Yang Qi this time.

"I-It’s burning! The Yang Qi is also burning with alchemy flames!" Wu Jingjing exclaimed in a shocked voice after witnessing this scene.

"That is a technique called ’Dragon’s Breath’," Su Yang said with a proud-looking expression on his face. "Only those who have complete mastery over their alchemy flames would dare to infuse their Yang Qi with alchemy flames."

"Are there any benefits in doing that?" Wu Jingjing asked him.

"No, not really. It’s really only meant to impress your partners. Of course, it also feels better than doing it normally," Su Yang said.

"Do you want to try it?" he then asked her.

"Y-Yes!" Wu Jingjing nodded, mostly because she didn’t want to lose to Zhu Mengyi.

A few moments later, Wu Jingjing laid on the bed and Su Yang rubbed his shaft on her slit.

"This feels... amazing..." Wu Jingjing spoke in awe, and she was at a loss for words.

"If you think this feels good, just wait until I stick it inside..." Su Yang chuckled.

After rubbing on her pink jewel for some time, Su Yang suddenly inserted his flaming dragon into her cave, causing Wu Jingjing’s body to jolt from shock.

"Aaaaah! This... This is...!" Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Once his entire meatstick was inside her hole, Su Yang began thrusting his h.i.p.s, smacking her meat with his burning rod.

"Aaahh!"

"Aaaaaah!"

"Aaah!"

"Aaaah~!"

Wu Jingjing’s entire body was quickly drenched in sweat from the burning sensation all over her body, feeling as though she’d been tossed into an oven, yet she did not want the feeling of pleasure to stop.

"More! Make me feel hotter! I want to melt in your embrace, Su Yang!" Wu Jingjing pleaded.

"Then let’s see if you can endure this—"

Su Yang suddenly released his flaming Yang Qi into her cave, but he did not stop moving his h.i.p.s and continued to pound her cave that was engulfed in alchemy flames.

"!!!!!!!"

The feeling of pleasure was so intense that Wu Jingjing fell unconscious after experiencing it for only 10 seconds.

Seeing this, Su Yang unplugged his rod from her hole, and his flaming Yang Qi immediately flowed like a river from her cave.

"Let me clean that for you, Su Yang..." Zhu Mengyi crawled in front of his still flaming rod and began licking it without any hesitation.

"You can swallow the flaming Yang Qi if you want; it’s completely safe," Su Yang said to her as she cleaned his rod.

Zhu Mengyi nodded, and she swallowed the burning Yang Qi, feeling a burning sensation flow down her throat, almost as though she was drinking strong alcohol.

"I’m so relieved and happy that you decided to return to us, Su Yang... I don’t know how long I would’ve lasted without you..." Zhu Mengyi sighed afterward.

"And I won’t leave you again— I promise." Su Yang said while gently caressing her smooth face.

"Un. I— We will follow you no matter where you go," Zhu Mengyi nodded with blissful tears falling down her face.
