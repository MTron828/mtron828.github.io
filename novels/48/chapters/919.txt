Chapter 920 - Leaving Frozen Asgard

A few hours after leaving the mountain valley, Su Yang and the others also managed to leave the mountain pass safely. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

And since they had Luo Ziyi protecting them, there wasn’t any need for them to use the hidden passages, allowing them to just fly straight through the Frozen Asgard effortlessly, almost like the Frozen Asgard had turned into a park for them.​​

"I have been wondering for a while now, but who is this little girl? I can tell that she’s also disguised, but she doesn’t have a Family Seal on her." Luo Ziyi as they made their way out of the Frozen Asgard.

Su Yang smiled and said, "Take a guess."

When he told her about his experience in the other world, he purposefully left out details about Xiao Rong to surprise her.

Luo Ziyi looked at Xiao Rong with a pondering look on her face.

After a moment of silence, she spoke, "She’s not human, so she’s likely a magical beast. I find her aura a little familiar, but I cannot recall where I have sensed it before or what kind of magical beast she is."

"Here’s a few hints. She is small, has incredible spiritual strength, and can even find treasures with ease. Ah, she’s also extremely fast."

"She can find treasures?" Luo Ziyi raised her eyebrows.

There were only a handful of magical beasts with such a unique ability in the Four Divine Heavens, and most of them are small. However, there is only one that is both fast and has strong spiritual strength."

"Don’t tell me she’s a Ghost Cat?" Luo Ziyi made an educated guess.

Su Yang chuckled and said, "Close, but not quite."

"What? What else besides Ghost Cats are fast, can find treasures, and even have strong spiritual strength, which is their specialty?"

"What about a Phantom Cat?"

"Phantom Cat?! The ancestor of Ghost Cats?! How did you come across such a ridiculously rare ancient beast?!" she exclaimed.

"Do you remember the spatial device I gave you? I found her inside," he said.

"What? You found a Phantom Cat inside a spatial device? How is that even remotely possible? I don’t believe you!"

"Let me tell you about it first. I kept it out on purpose to surprise you."

Su Yang proceeded to tell her about his experience inside the spatial device and how he found Xiao Rong.

"Unbelievable... To think someone from the Heavenly Order ended up in that world after their war with the Asura God Clan. But that doesn’t explain why there’s a Phantom Cat inside that person’s spatial device." Luo Ziyi said after hearing the story.

"I can only think of one possibility. Xiao Rong somehow entered the spatial device and got stuck inside. Although Phantom Cats and Ghost Cats can be born from nothing, it is highly unlikely that there was enough spiritual energy inside the spatial device to give birth to a Ghost Cat, much less a Phantom Cat."

"Why don’t you ask her?"

"I have, but she doesn’t remember anything."

"Is that so... Then maybe you can take her to you-know-who and have her check out Xiao Rong." Luo Ziyi suggested.

Su Yang smiled and said, "I already have plans to take Xiao Rong to her."

"Who?" Xiao Rong asked out of curiosity.

"Let’s just say that she’s an expert with Ghost Cats and the likes," he said.

"You’ll know when you see her."

Xiao Rong nodded.

A week later, they left the Frozen Asgard and arrived at the nearest city.

"I will see you later, Su— Xiao Yang." Luo Ziyi said to him.

"Yes. See you in a few days."

Su Yang then went to the Frozen Palace with Xiao Rong while Luo Ziyi went to the teleport formation.

"G-Greetings, Immortal Fairy Luo!"

Everybody greeted her.

The people waiting in line also greeted her before they made a path for her, allowing her to go first.

"Take me to the Sacred City," she said.

"Right away!"

The workers immediately started working on the teleport formation.

A few minutes later, they were finished.

Luo Ziyi then paid the fees before entering the teleport formation.

Upon exiting the teleport formation on the other side, Luo Ziyi retrieved her flying treasure and started making her way to the other teleport formation— the one that will take her to the Sacred Lands.

"Welcome back, Immortal Fairy Luo." They said to her.

Luo Ziyi didn’t say anything and entered the portal sometime later, arriving at the Sacred Lands.

At the Sacred Lands, Luo Ziyi used her flying treasure again and quickly returned to her sect.

"Welcome back, Sect Master." The disciples there greeted her.

"I’m back."

Luo Ziyi then returned to her own living quarters before taking out her communication jade slip and summoning everyone from the Su Family within the sect— even those that were not at the sect.

The first to show up was Wang Yunxuan.

"Sister Ziyi, welcome back." Wang Yunxuan said to her.

"I’m back," she responded with a smile.

Despite trying to keep a poker face to not reveal anything to her until everyone gathered, Luo Ziyi couldn’t help but smile when she saw Wang Yunxuan, as she could only imagine her reaction once she reveals the news to her and everyone else.

"You seem to be in a good mood. Are you willing to tell me what the message was all about now?" Wang Yunxuan asked her.

"Just be patient, Sister Yunxuan. This is something that all of you should experience together."

"Everyone? You summoned the other sisters as well? This must be fairly important."

Luo Ziyi nodded.

"Now I am really curious..." Wang Yunxuan smiled.

Three days later, 12 women— 12 extremely beautiful goddesses gathered in Luo Ziyi’s living quarters.
