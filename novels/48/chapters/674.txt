Chapter 675 - You Can’t Do That to Me!

"It’s been two hours since we served that young man the poisoned food— it’s about time I check up on them as instructed by Her Highness..." Jiu Chun mumbled to himself as he made his way towards the ninth floor.

’Hmm? It’s awfully silent up here...’ Jiu Chun raised his eyebrows in a puzzled manner, as he’d expected some sort of commotion. Furthermore, the closer he got to their room, the more anxious he felt for some reason, almost as though his instincts were telling him to stay away from that room.

"Your Highness, may I come inside?" Jiu Chun asked her from the outside.

However, there was no response even after waiting for many moments.

"Your Highness? It’s Jiu Chun, and I have come here as instructed," he repeated.

After another moment of silence, a voice from inside the room resounded, yet it was clearly not Lian Li’s voice, as it sounded like a young man’s voice.

"You may come inside," Su Yang said to him from the inside.

"..."

Jiu Chun immediately frowned after hearing Su Yang’s calm and nonchalant voice.

’Did something happen? Why does he sound so normal and tranquil despite consuming the poison?’ Jiu Chun pondered to himself in silence, not daring to open the door and feeling an ominous feeling in his stomach.

"Did you not hear me? I said you can come inside," Su Yang’s voice resounded again, this time sounding a little bit more annoyed.

"W-What happened to Her Highness?" Jiu Chun still didn’t dare to enter without her permission and asked Su Yang.

"Don’t worry about her— she’s safe." Su Yang responded, making it sound as though he did something terrible to her.

"What?! Do you have any idea what you’ve done?! That was Emperor Lian’s beloved daughter!" Jiu Chun exclaimed in a shocked voice.

However, Su Yang did not respond until a good moment later, "Why don’t you come inside first? We’ll talk as much as you want afterward."

"..."

Jiu Chun was speechless. As much as he wanted to turn around and run away, he didn’t dare to abandon Lian Li, who could be in imminent danger right now, as that in itself would be a death sentence!

After swallowing nervously and taking a deep breath, Jiu Chun finally decided to open the door.

However, once he’d opened the door and saw the situation inside, he was greatly dumbfounded.

"W-Where’s Her Highness?" Jiu Chun immediately asked him about Lian Li, ignoring the large puddle of liquid below the desk and the wet walls.

"Her? She went home after a satisfying dinner," Su Yang responded with a calm smile on his face.

"A satisfying dinner? Cut the bullshit! She wouldn’t leave just like this!" Jiu Chun quickly exclaimed.

"Why not? Because you tried to poison me?" Su Yang suddenly narrowed his eyes at Jiu Chun, sending chills down his spine.

"Heh! So what if I poisoned you? It was Her Highness command, and I was simply following her orders!" Jiu Chun coldly sneered at him, not even bothering to hide his criminal act.

"So if she told you to kill yourself, would you do it?"

"I..." Jiu Chun opened his mouth only to close it without saying anything.

"So you are willing to take another’s life but not your own? What a hypocrite you are..." Su Yang shook his head in a disapproving manner.

"Shut up! You won’t die from consuming that kind of poison anyway! And how the hell are you perfectly fine?! Did you not eat the food?!"

"Oh, I ate the food alright, and it was quite amazing besides the fact that it was laced with poison."

"Then why are you not ejaculating everywhere like you are supposed to!" Jiu Chun pointed at him and said.

"I don’t know, maybe there was something wrong with the poison? Why don’t you try it for yourself?"

"Wha—?!"

Su Yang suddenly appeared in front of Jiu Chun and grabbed him by the neck before showing him a round-shaped ball that resembled a pill. However, if one could smell the rich aroma from the pill, they would immediately think it’s actually food.

"T-That can’t be!" Jiu Chun looked at the food that was pinched into a pill with a terrified expression. "D-Don’t you dare! Who do you think I am?!"

Jiu Chun immediately released his Sovereign Spirit Realm cultivation base, but alas, Su Yang used his fingers to poke into his meridians, instantly sealing his cultivation.

"W-What did you just do to me?!" Jiu Chun cried out in horror after realizing that he could no longer muster his strength, feeling completely powerless in Su Yang’s grasp.

"If I were you, I would be worrying about what I am about to do to you..."

"Stop it! I am the owner of the Nine Spring Halls! I have connections to nearly every major power in this world! If you touch me, you can forget about living in peace for the rest of your life!" Knowing that he cannot physically stop Su Yang, Jiu Chun began threatening him with his own status instead.

However, Su Yang acted as though he was deaf and flicked the food pill into Jiu Chun’s mouth before using spiritual energy to force it down his throat.

"No! No! No!" Jiu Chun began panicking after feeling the pill enter his stomach.

"In a few minutes, you will start ejaculating uncontrollably, and I am going to drag you through every floor and every room in this building so your customers can watch. Even if you were following Lian Li’s orders, since you dared to poison someone, you can’t complain about being poisoned yourself!"

"What?! You can’t do that to me!" Jiu Chun looked at Su Yang as though he was looking at the devil, but alas, as much as he wanted to run away, his entire cultivation base was sealed.

"I can’t? Watch me!" Su Yang said, and he began dragging Jiu Chun downstairs by his neck, treating him as though he was a chicken prepared to be slaughtered!Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m
