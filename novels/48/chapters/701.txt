Chapter 702 - Devil Blood Ginseng

"What’s so funny, young man? Have you already gone crazy? It hasn’t even been a minute since you have been trapped." Sect Master Qian said to him with raised eyebrows, puzzled by Su Yang’s reaction.

After laughing for a good moment, Su Yang wiped the tears in his eyes before speaking, "So you can see the formation in the cave, huh? You are not half bad, I’ll give you at least that."

"You also know about the formation?" Sect Master Qian quickly frowned.

The formation in the cave was profoundly powerful— so powerful that only he was able to see it and nobody else, and not even his friends that were top Formation experts in this world could see it. In fact, he’d only found it by chance.

"Yes, I do, and judging from your words just now, I can assume that you’re trying to crack the formation. However, I have some unfortunate news for you. One, you will not be able to crack that formation even if you tried for however long you have left in your life. Two, you won’t be able to crack the formation even if every Formation expert in this world were to work together for a thousand years. And finally, if you think you can trap me inside this pathetic formation, you are in way over your head."

"You... Just who are you?" Sect Master Qian looked at him with wide eyes filled with shock.

"You shouldn’t stick your nose where it doesn’t belong or you might get hurt." Su Yang casually lifted his right hand and gently poked the Ensnaring Formation with his index fingers.

A second later, the entire Ensnaring Formation cracked like a mirror before exploding into countless tiny fragments, shocking everybody there, especially Sect Master Qian, who was very confident of his formation.

"I-Impossible! Even though I didn’t put too much power into creating the formation, it’s not something a mere Junior can shatter so easily!" Sect Master Qian took a step back from shock, his gaze filled with disbelief.

After destroying the formation, Su Yang looked at the old man and said, "Let me show you what a real Ensnaring Formation looks like!"

Su Yang snapped his fingers at the end of his sentence, and many formations suddenly appeared around Sect Master Qian and the other disciples there.

Each of these formations had walls that were as thick as an a.d.u.l.t’s biceps, and there was enough room inside these formations for one to sleep in.

"T-This is!" Sect Master Qian and his disciples looked at the formation that surrounded them with a shocked look on their faces.

However, when they realized the power of these formations, they couldn’t help but unconsciously admire the formations despite being trapped inside them.

"Wait a second... This formation... It’s very familiar to the one in the cave! Don’t tell me you are the one who created it?! Why?! For what purpose did you create such a powerful formation there? What are you hiding?! Who are you?!" Sect Master Qian immediately began bombarding Su Yang with questions after realizing the truth. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

However, Su Yang merely shook his head and ignored the old man. He then approached the cave and went inside after removing the formation with ease.

Once he was inside the bandits’ hideout, Su Yang immediately noticed that the blood that was supposed to cover the floor had magically disappeared, almost like someone had entered this place and cleaned it.

However, Su Yang knew very well that this was impossible, as his formation remained untouched, so this phenomenon could only be related to the Devil Blood Ginseng.

Su Yang then walked to where the Devil Blood Ginseng was growing last time, and just as he’d expected, the Devil Blood Ginseng was fully blooming and ready to be harvested.

After carefully plucking the Devil Blood Ginseng, Su Yang placed it inside a preservation box he’d prepared beforehand and closed it, keeping the Devil Blood Ginseng fresh for essentially forever until the box is opened again.

Once he’d obtained the Devil Blood Ginseng, Su Yang returned outside, where the people from the Golden Star Formation Sect were still trapped inside his formation.

"Hey! Let me out of here! Do you know who I am?!" Sect Master Qian shouted at Su Yang after seeing him return.

"I am Qian Liren, the number one Formation expert in the Eastern Continent! I have close relationsh.i.p.s with the Xie Family and even Lord Xie himself!"

Su Yang walked to stand in front of him and spoke in a mocking voice, "You are the number one Formation expert in the Eastern Continent? How laughable."

"I am telling the truth! I have personally assisted with the creation of many defensive formations around the Eastern Continent!" Qian Liren said.

Su Yang shook his head and said, "I don’t doubt that you’re the number one Formation expert in the Eastern Continent as you were able to see my formation. Even though it was created last year when I just entered the Heavenly Spirit Realm, it’s still an achievement that you should be proud of. Therefore, I won’t kill you. Instead, I’ll just keep you trapped inside the formation for an entire month, as that’s when the formation will deactivate by itself."

"An entire month?! That’s crazy! You can’t do that to me!" Qian Liren said with a terrified expression on his face.

"As an expert at the peak of the Earth Spirit Realm, you can live an entire year without food or water with relative ease, so you’ll be fine. As for your disciples that are only at the Profound Spirit Realm... Well, they’ll manage. While they won’t die, they’ll definitely suffer a little. Anyways, I am a busy man with places to be so I’ll leave now."

After ending his sentence, Su Yang retrieved the wooden flying boat and jumped onto it before speeding away, ignoring the loud screams coming from behind him.

A few minutes later, he returned to Snowfall City with the Devil Blood Ginseng in hand.
