Chapter 917 - Does This Make Me the First?

"Mmm~!"

"Aaaa~!"​​

The Frozen Azure Cave echoed with Luo Ziyi’s blissful voice and the sound of Su Yang’s rod pounding her meat.

"I-Is it just me, or did you get even better?" Luo Ziyi asked him while he continued drilling her body.

"Really? I don’t know." Su Yang said with a smile.

Luo Ziyi then held out her arms in front of her and said, "Hold me, Su Yang."

He nodded and released her waist before grabbing her hand.

Once their fingers were locked, Su Yang moved his h.i.p.s even faster.

"Mmm~!"

Luo Ziyi’s immortal cave gushed with Yin Qi, but Su Yang didn’t dare to absorb these Yin Qi, as his cultivation base was far too lacking. Therefore, he could only treat this as casual s.e.x instead of dual cultivation.

The two of them continued to cultivate with each other for an entire week while Xiao Rong watched them with a somewhat envious gaze.

Su Yang has only ever used his sword to pierce her rear end, and she wondered how it would feel in the front.

This curious and envious feeling only got stronger as she watched Luo Ziyi display extreme bliss and satisfaction.

After a week of straight s.e.x and without releasing his Yang Qi once, Su Yang asked her, "Ziyi... I know you have asked me before... to i.m.p.r.e.g.n.a.t.e you. Do you still want my children? If so, I will i.m.p.r.e.g.n.a.t.e you right now."

"Eh?" Luo Ziyi stopped m.o.a.ning to stare at him with a shocked expression on her face.

"W-What did you just say? I don’t think I heard you properly..." Luo Ziyi said, doubting her ears.

"I said... Do you still want my children? You asked me before, remember?"

"O-Of course, I remember..." she nodded.

And she continued, "I also remember how you’d adamantly refuse my request— as well as the others."

Su Yang smiled and said, "Well, I have changed. I am willing to i.m.p.r.e.g.n.a.t.e you— all of you now."

"R-Really? You’re not messing with me?"

"Yes," he nodded to confirm.

"Do you want to bear my child, Ziyi?" Su Yang asked her again.

"I do!" She responded immediately this time.

"Then here it comes!" Su Yang then released his Yang Qi, and an entire week’s worth of Yang Qi gushed into Luo Ziyi’s immortal cave.

The Yang Qi quickly overflowed her cave.

Su Yang unplugged his rod from her body a moment later.

"Let me clean it for you." Luo Ziyi then licked his rod clean with her mouth.

Despite cultivating with Su Yang for an entire week straight, Luo Ziyi clearly had plenty of energy left.

As much as she wanted to continue cultivating with him, they will have to continue this another day when their environment is more suitable for dual cultivation. Furthermore, there were still a lot of things they needed to talk about."

"Su Yang, does this make me the first person to bear your child?" Luo Ziyi asked him sometime after they wore their clothes again.

"Well..." Su Yang showed her a smile with a deep meaning behind it.

"What? Don’t tell me I’m not? Then who’s the first one? How come I haven’t heard about it?"

"Probably because it happened when I was in another world," he said.

Luo Ziyi’s eyes widened with shock, and her jaw dropped, leaving her mouth wide open.

"Y-You i.m.p.r.e.g.n.a.t.ed one of the new sisters?"

Su Yang nodded and said, "It’s not just one, either. I have 5 children right now with four different women."

"Heavens..." Luo Ziyi was left speechless by this revelation.

"Do you want to meet them? It should be safe now with the concealment formation around us." Su Yang then said to her.

"Yes!" she quickly responded.

"Alright."

Su Yang then retrieved the spatial device and opened the Immortal’s Treasure.

Sometime later, he went inside with Luo Ziyi and Xiao Rong. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Upon entering the Immortal’s Treasury, Su Yang teleported them directly to the second floor where the others were living.

Of course, Su Yang had notified them before they entered the spatial device, so everybody living inside the Immortal’s Treasury was already gathered and waiting for their arrival.

"Su Yang!"

The ladies there immediately smiled when they saw Su Yang’s handsome face again.

Although they hear his voice pretty often, this was their first time seeing him in person since they arrived at the Four Divine Heavens three months ago.

"Wow, what a beautiful lady..." Sun Jingjing subconsciously mumbled when she saw Luo Ziyi.

While they knew Su Yang wanted to introduce them to someone, they didn’t know who exactly, but when they saw Luo Ziyi, they immediately knew her relationship with Su Yang, especially when they felt the Family Seal’s on their body reacting to her.

"It’s been a while, ladies. Let me introduce you to Luo Ziyi. If you can’t tell by now, she’s a member of the Su Family from the Four Divine Heavens." Su Yang said to them.

"Hello..." Luo Ziyi said to them with a calm expression on her face, yet she was greatly shocked inwardly when she saw four beautiful women carrying babies in their arms.

’Are they all... Su Yang’s children?’ Luo Ziyi felt an indescribable feeling in her heart when she saw these babies.

"Hi! My name is Sun Jingjing, and I used to be a fellow disciple of Su Yang!" Sun Jingjing was the first to introduce herself.

Once Sun Jingjing finished her introduction, the next person went, and they would continue this until everyone there had introduced themselves.

However, Luo Ziyi was barely paying attention to their introductions, as she was completely focused on the babies.

When Xie Xingfang noticed Luo Ziyi staring at the babies, she spoke with a smile on her face, "Senior sister, would you like to carry one of them?"

"Eh?" Luo Ziyi snapped out of her daze and looked at her face for the first time.

"I noticed you were staring at them, so I thought you might’ve wanted to take a closer look. If I’m wrong, I apologize—"

"No, you’re right. I’d like to hold them for a moment if you don’t mind." Luo Ziyi quickly interrupted with a somewhat bashful look on her face.

The smile on Su Yang’s face grew wider when he saw this, and he laughed inwardly at Luo Ziyi’s unusual reaction to the babies.
