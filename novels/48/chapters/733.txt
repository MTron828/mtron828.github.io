Chapter 734 Secret Lover

"Who’s there?! How dare you barge into this place! Do you have any idea who we are?!" Madam Xiang stood up and pointed at Su Yang who’d just entered the room without any warning.

"No, I don’t— not that I care at all." Su Yang entered the room with a calm expression on his face.

"Y-You are..." Xiang Zhongfa immediately recognized Su Yang’s face, as he was present at the Regional Tournament.

However, before he could even open his mouth to speak, his mother approached Su Yang and said in an overbearing voice, "I don’t know who you are but if you think you are being smart then I highly urge you to get on your knees and beg for forgiveness!"

Xiang Zhongfa immediately began sweating after seeing his mother’s reaction, but alas, even if he wanted to stop her, it was already too late.

"Get on my knees and beg? I don’t think you can bear the responsibilities for that, Xiang Family," Su Yang said with a smile on his face.

Madam Xiang immediately frowned after hearing his words.

’So he knows our identity? Yet he’s acting this arrogant before us? Who is he?’ she pondered inwardly.

"Excuse me..." Cai Yan suddenly stood up and approached them.

Once she stood beside Su Yang, Cai Yan took a few deep breaths before looking at him with her eyes wide with surprise.

"Are you perhaps...?" Cai Yan mumbled in a voice of disbelief.

Su Yang chuckled after seeing this, as he recalled when Su Yin managed to guess his real identity by his smell. Because of Cai Yan’s powerful nose, it was only natural that she would be able to smell ’Senior Xiao’ from Su Yang.

"You know this insolent little brat? Don’t tell me he’s the real reason you refuse to marry my son? Is he your lover? Everything makes sense now." Madam Xiang turned to look at Cai Yun and said to her.

"What?! Is that true, Cai Yan?! Is he really your lover?!" Even her parents stood up in shock, as this is their first time hearing about their daughter having a secret lover.

Cai Yan raised her eyebrows at their reaction. However, before she could even say anything, Su Yang suddenly wrapped his arms around her shoulders and pulled her into his body.

"That’s right. She’s my woman. What are you going to do about it?" Su Yang said with a smile on his face.

’M-Master...?’ Cai Yan looked at him with a surprised face and completely speechless.

"Haha! I knew it!" Madam Xiang coldly sneered in disgust after seeing this, and she continued, "To think I wasted my precious time here, even almost fooled by a vixen who already has her legs spread for another man! Cai Family, I will have you bear responsibility for playing with the Xiang Family!"

"As for you, you little brat! If you think you can hide your identity from me, you are dead wrong! Once I learn your name and background, I will also be coming for you!"

"P-Please wait, Senior Xiang! We also didn’t know about this! I swear!" Cai Yan’s mother quickly said, and she looked at Cai Yan and said, "I demand an explanation for this, Yan’er!"

It was at this moment Senior Zeng and Luo Yixao caught up with Su Yang and entered the room. However, they immediately realized the tense and heavy atmosphere in the room. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

’W-What on earth happened here?’ Senior Zeng cried inwardly.

"You are... Senior Zeng? What are you doing here?" Madam Xiang immediately recognized Senior Zeng’s old face the moment she saw him because their Xiang Family has done business with the Divine Nature Garden many times throughout the years.

"Well..." Senior Zeng scratched his head, unsure of how to answer her question.

Meanwhile, Cai Yan’s parents said, "Senior Zeng! Luo Yixiao! If you’re here, does this mean Senior Xiao is also here?"

"Senior Xiao is here? Where?" Even Madam Xiang couldn’t help but become excited after hearing his name. If the Xiang Family can forge a connection with Senior Xiao, he might supply them with Earth Advancement Pills and perhaps even Heaven Transcendence Pills!

"Senior Xiao is... uhh..." Senior Zeng glanced at ’Senior Xiao’ who was standing right in front of Madam Xiang. He wanted to say ’He’s right in front of you!’ but he didn’t know if he could reveal his real identity.

However, while Senior Zeng was pondering, Su Yang began walking away with Cai Yan still in his arms.

"We have already wasted enough time here. Let’s hurry up and meet with Wang Shuren at the Burning Lotus Sect and begin the lectures," Su Yang said to them in a loud voice.

"Huh?" Everybody in the room snapped their heads to look at Su Yang with wide eyes. Although their gaze was filled with confusion at first, once they realized the meaning behind his words, Cai Yan’s parents’ exclaimed in a shocked voice, "Y-Y-You’re Senior Xiao?!"

"What?! This brat is Senior Xiao?! That’s impossible! Not even an idiot would come to this conclusion!" Madam Xiang immediately voiced her doubts, and she continued, "There’s simply no way someone this young can reach the Alchemy mastery that Senior Xiao has achieved! Not at his age!"

Hearing Madam Xiang’s words, Su Yang stopped walking and said with a smile on his face, "In the cultivation world the most deceitful thing would be one’s appearance. If you continue judging someone by their cover, you’ll deeply regret it."

Su Yang then turned to look at Cai Yan’s parents and said, "I know you’re in the middle of something right now, but Cai Yan has already given her answer, so I’ll be borrowing her for a few days for lectures."

Speechless, Cai Yan’s parents could only nod their heads in a dazed manner.

After Su Yang left with his disciples, Madam Xiang screamed loudly while stomping her feet, "Just who is that man?!"

Xiang Zhongfa responded a moment later, "Mother... That was Su Yang... from the Profound Blossom Sect."

"What?!" Madam Xiang turned to look at him with her eyes wide from shock.
