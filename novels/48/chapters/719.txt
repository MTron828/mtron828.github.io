Chapter 720 - I Will I.m.p.r.e.g.n.a.t.e You as Many Times as You Want

Once Wu Jingjing and the other ladies left the room, Su Yang approached the crying Su Liqing and gently placed his arms around her waist, almost as though he was afraid of hurting her.

He then slowly pulled her towards the bed before sitting down and placing Su Liqing to sit on his lap.

"What’s the matter, Liqing? If there’s anything that’s bothering you— anything at all— just let me know and I will immediately deal with it." Su Yang spoke to her in a soft voice, sounding as though he was trying to calm down a crying child.

"And if I did something wrong, you can also tell me and I will—"

Hearing his words, Su Liqing immediately shook her head, and then she said, "There’s nothing wrong with you, Su Yang. Nothing at all. However, I really don’t know why I am crying. It began flowing unconsciously when I saw the children— your daughters, and I don’t know why. Please believe me, Su Yang..."

"The children...? Of course, I believe you. Why wouldn’t I believe you?" Su Yang said as he gently caressed her hands.

"I’m sorry for making you worried, Su Yang..." Su Liqing sighed a moment later. "This has never happened before."

"It’s okay. I’m just relieved that it’s nothing serious," Su Yang said.

Su Liqing lifted her head and stared at Su Yang in the eyes with a passionate gaze.

Su Yang, obviously, stared back at her.

A moment later, their faces approached each other and they began kissing intimately.

After many minutes of kissing, Su Yang suddenly said to her, "Liqing, if you ever want children, do not hesitate to ask. Although I used to refuse to have children no matter what, things have changed."

"Me...? Children?" Su Liqing looked at him with a dazed face.

"You already have two daughters and you still want more?" Su Liqing laughed softly.

"Actually, there’s more than two. Although it didn’t seem like it, Lian Li and Xie Xingfang are also pregnant with my child right now." Su Yang said.

"W-Wait a second... Xie Xingfang...? Her Highness...? When did you two..." Su Liqing looked at him with a shocked expression on her face.

"Haha... It’s a long story so I’ll tell you another time."

"So you already have 2 daughters right now with at least 2 more coming in the future, huh? Congratulations, Su Yang. I cannot believe you were just an Outer Court disciple not long ago." Su Liqing said to him with a beautiful smile.

And then she continued, "Though, if you don’t mind me asking, why do you want so many children? According to my knowledge, most Dual Cultivators choose to not have any children with their partners— at least not until very late down the line. I know that you used to be an Immortal in your previous life, but you are barely 18 years old right now."

Su Yang showed a bittersweet smile and said, "My desire for children is probably due to something that happened in the past with my first wife."

"Your... first wife?" Su Liqing raised her eyebrows.

"Yes— this is way before I was a Dual Cultivator and way before I even had any reputation for myself. I was just like any ordinary young man who yearned for a partner back then, and when I found my first wife, I dedicated everything to her."

Su Yang closed his eyes to recall his memories— the beautiful face of his first wife.

"My first wife... Her name was Meiqi— Su Meiqi after she took my surname. And she has wanted a child with me ever since our first night together. However, no matter how many times we tried, she could not conceive. Because she used to be a powerful general who fought multiple wars, perhaps her inability to conceive was due to an injury she received during a battle, or maybe it’s simply because she was born like that— we don’t know."

"Anyway, even though it mattered a lot to Su Meiqi that we have a child, it really didn’t matter to me, as my only purpose at the time was to make her happy by fulfilling her every desire. But alas, no matter what we tried, she was still unable to conceive— even until the day she died of old age."

"..." Su Liqing was speechless, as she didn’t think he would have such a tragic backstory with his first wife.

Su Yang continued sometime later, "When I became a Dual Cultivator, the first thing I did was practice this cultivation technique that allowed me to have perfect control of my Yang Qi, which would allow me to i.m.p.r.e.g.n.a.t.e a woman whenever I desired with 100% efficiency. Of course, that doesn’t help those who do not have the ability to conceive like my first wife, so I started practicing medicine, which allowed me to fix that problem. However, despite spending many years perfecting both techniques, I never really got the chance to use those skills, as I never had any intentions to i.m.p.r.e.g.n.a.t.e my partners."

"Of course, there had been countless women who wanted to bear my child, but I would always refuse, as I was never interested in that matter, not to mention that I have many enemies throughout the world, and having children would only give them more power over me."

"However, I have changed. This world— you girls have changed my mind. I want to start a family no matter what. After all, I cannot call myself a real man if I cannot fulfill my partners’ desire because I am afraid of my enemies."

Su Yang then looked at Su Liqing in the eyes and said, "Therefore, if you also want a child with me, I will i.m.p.r.e.g.n.a.t.e you as many times as you want."

After staring at Su Yang with a dazed expression for a long minute, Su Liqing suddenly spoke with a blushing face, "Su Yang... I want your child." ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Su Yang then smiled and said, "Although I would begin now, we cannot make the others wait outside too long. Let’s do this another time— tomorrow."

"Okay." Su Liqing nodded.
