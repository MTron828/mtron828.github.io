Chapter 589 Golden Lion Academy“s Invasion 9

"By the way... that treasure you obtained from General Lai... can it really send someone to the Holy Central Continent?" Xie Wang asked Su Yang sometime later with a serious expression.

"Do you want to go to the Holy Central Continent?" Su Yang smiled at his obvious intentions.

"Yes!" Xie Wang nodded, not even bothering to beat around the bush.

If he could go to the Holy Central Continent that is regarded as a Cultivator’s heaven, perhaps he might be able to further improve his cultivation base. At his current age and with his talents, Xie Wang was aware of his slim chances for another breakthrough, and entering the Sovereign Spirit Realm was already a miracle.

Su Yang then said, "After examining this talisman, I can say for sure that it has the ability to transport people. However, we don’t really know if it’ll really transport you to the Holy Central Continent or somewhere else in the world. Perhaps the Moonlight Blades merely got lucky with their location and ended up in the Holy Central Continent."

"I am willing to test the talisman!" Xie Wang quickly volunteered.

"You might end up in the middle of the Jade Sea, you know?" Su Yang said.

"I don’t care even if I end up at the bottom of the Jade Sea! As long as there’s a chance that I can go to the Holy Central Continent, I am willing to take the risk!" Xie Wang said.

Su Yang smiled at his eagerness and said, "You know... If you really want to go to the Holy Central Continent, I can bring you there with the flying ship. It won’t take more than a few minutes, and it has zero risks involved."

"R-Really?! Can you really do that?!" Xie Wang’s eyes widened with shock. But when he recalled the flying ship’s speed, his excitement skyrocketed.

Su Yang nodded and said, "I plan on visiting the Holy Central Continent after dealing with the person coming from that place anyway. It won’t make much of a difference if I brought along a few people with me."

"Thank you! I won’t forget this debt for the rest of my life!" Xie Wang quickly bowed to him.

"You’re exaggerating. I don’t need anything in return." Su Yang shook his head.

"Anyway, there’s less than a day left before they arrive. I’m going to cultivate and prepare myself." Su Yang said to him before disappearing into the ship.

Once Su Yang left the scene, Xie Xingfang said to Xie Wang, "I never thought there’d be a day where the Xie Family would owe someone a debt that cannot be paid fully."

"Do you finally feel like giving yourself to him now?" Xie Wang asked her with a wide smile on his face.

"That’s not a very funny joke, grandfather."

"Who said I was joking?" Xie Wang shook his head and said, "If I was a woman, I’d be willing to do anything just to be with him."

Xie Xingfang looked at him with a weird expression, but she couldn’t refute his words.

"I know you want him to be exclusive, but the truth is, men with status and power are more often than not shared by many women. Of course, there also exist women who have multiple husbands at their beckoning. If you are looking for someone like Su Yang but without the other women, then you might as well be looking for a real dragon."

"Then why does my father only have one wife?" Xie Xingfang asked him. "What about you, grandfather? Where are your parents?"

Xie Wang laughed out loud after hearing her words, and he spoke, "Although I may not look like it, I used to be quite the playboy back in my prime days with over a hundred beauties as my partner simultaneously. Though, I am now too old to find any enjoyment in that kind of stuff. As for your father... he also used to have many partners. However, after meeting your mother, he also stopped seeing other women. But unlike my situation, it was your mother who used her charms to convince him."

"You two are..." Xie Xingfang looked at Xie Wang with a dumbfounded expression, clearly speechless about their history.

"And before you start having weird ideas, just remember that Su Yang’s not a normal Cultivator but a Dual Cultivator. His life revolves around many partners in his life."

"...I know, grandfather... I know..." Xie Xingfang sighed, and she spoke a moment later, "I’m going to rest now. I’ll need as much energy as I can get for tomorrow..."

Once Xie Wang was alone, he returned to watching the Moonlight Blades members trying to break out of Su Yang’s formation.

"Keep struggling, you little ants. The more you struggle, the more despair you will feel." He mumbled with a slight smile on his face.

Time passed exceedingly fast, and within the blink of an eye, an entire day has passed.

"Master, they’re here." Xiao Rong suddenly appeared in Su Yang’s room like a ghost and warned him, who had been sitting on the bed with his eyes closed.

Su Yang slowly opened his eyes, and a profound flicker appeared within his gaze.

"Let’s greet our visitors, shall we?" He said as he got off the bed.

After leaving his room, Su Yang went to notify everyone in the flying ship regarding the situation.

"So they are finally here..." Xie Wang narrowed his eyes with a serious expression.

"I will greet them with the old man first. Don’t show yourselves for now." Su Yang said to the three beauties.

"Un." Xiao Rong nodded.

"What a shame. I was looking forward to beating him up some more." Qiuyue said with a calm expression. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

"Be careful, Grandfather, Su Yang..." Xie Xingfang said to them with her fists tightly grasped into a fist. Although she showed a calm appearance, she couldn’t help but feel nervous about the whole situation inwardly.

Seeing this, Su Yang gently grabbed her hands and spoke in a soft voice, "Relax. As long as I am here, even if the entire Holy Central Continent were present, I would not let them touch a single hair on your body."

After hearing Su Yang’s soothing and feeling his warm touch, Xie Xingfang immediately felt more relaxed, and she nodded with a rosy face, "Thank you, Su Yang..."

A few moments later, Su Yang and Xie Wang left the flying ship.
