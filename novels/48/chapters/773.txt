Chapter 774 This Is What I’ve Been Yearning For!

A couple of minutes later, Su Yang stood up and retrieved the pill from the cauldron, and he said, "Okay, I have the pill now. What about you? Have you decided on which technique you want in exchange for the Dew of Life?" Su Yang asked her afterward.

"What?! You’re done already?! How’s that possible! I may not be an Alchemist but I know it takes hours for one to complete a pill!" Ruan Xiao Qing exclaimed.

"Don’t compare me to those losers. Take a look at the pill if you’re doubtful."

Su Yang showed her the pink pill in his hands.

"That’s..."

Ruan Xiao Qing became speechless again. Did he really concoct that pill in just a few minutes?

"Anyway, let me know when you’re done." Su Yang said before walking to the couch.

"Come over here, little girl." Su Yang beckoned her with his hands after sitting down.

Shi Yuchun nodded and sat next to him.

"What is your name?" Su Yang asked her.

"Shi Yuchun," she said.

"Shi Yuchun, huh? Do you have a family?"

"No... They passed away last month," she responded.

"You have my condolences..." Su Yang said to her, and he continued, "Do you remember what I said to you before— that I want to continue to hire you?"

Once he saw Shi Yuchun nod her head, Su Yang continued to speak, "How do you feel about coming to work for me at my sect— the Profound Blossom Sect? You won’t have to become a Cultivator and or a disciple. Instead, you’ll do other stuff such as management and whatnot."

"If you work for the Profound Blossom Sect, I can promise you that you’ll never have to beg for money or walk around in ragged clothes ever again."

’The Profound Blossom Sect? I have never heard of a place like that before...’ Ruan Xiao Qing pondered to herself as she listened to Su Yang while trying to decide on her techniques.

"Okay," Shi Yuchun nodded her head without any hesitation.

"Good. Then I’ll take you back with me to the Eastern Continent once we’re done here." Su Yang nodded with a smile on his face.

"The Eastern Continent?!" Ruan Xiao Qing dropped the techniques and turned to look at him with wide eyes.

"Did I forget to mention that I am from the Eastern Continent? Well, not that it matters, anyway. Well? Have you decided on the techniques yet?"

"G-Give me some more time!" Ruan Xiao Qing quickly went back to looking at the techniques.

About ten more minutes later, Ruan Xiao Qing approached Su Yang with five of the twenty scrolls in her grasp and said to him, "I want these five Immortal-grade techniques."

Su Yang nodded and said, "Does that mean you’re willing to trade the Dew of Life?"

Ruan Xiao Qing clenched her teeth slightly and nodded, "Yes!"

Not only does Su Yang know the Lian Family but he’s technically a part of the Lian Family! There’s simply no way the Ruan Family could refuse the Lian Family, especially after learning his reason for needing the Dew of Life.

"Very well..." Su Yang nodded.

"Wait." Ruan Xiao Qing suddenly said, and she continued, "I will only give you the Dew of Life if you give me everything that you’d offered me."

"Everything...?" Su Yang raised his eyebrows, but he was confused by her words. Instead, he was slightly surprised.

Ruan Xiao Qing nodded and said, "Do you remember what you offered me besides the pill and the Immortal-grade techniques? Well, I want that, too! I know you’re Her Highness’s partner, but you’re a dual cultivator so it shouldn’t matter, right? I want you to satisfy me!"

Su Yang smiled at her words and said, "Are you sure? What about your husband?"

"What about my useless husband? As you’d said, his thing is as small as his temperament! I won’t be satisfied even if we did it all day. I was going to look for another man to satisfy me sooner or later!"

Although she didn’t want to say it, Ruan Xiao Qing had already planned on having Su Yang satisfy her when she agreed to follow him back to the Ruan Family alone. It was only after meeting the Lian Family that she’d decided to fully commit to her plans.

Of course, Su Yang already knew this and he only pretended obvious of her desires. In fact, he knew that Ruan Xiao Qing wanted to cheat on Ruan Zongze purely from the way she looked and spoke to him.

"Well? What do you say?" Ruan Xiao Qing asked him again a moment later.

"Do I even need to give you an answer? I would be delighted to satisfy you instead of that man. In fact, you won’t even notice his existence as a man after I am done with you!" Su Yang said with a smile on his face.

Su Yang then turned to look at Shi Yuchun and said, "I’ll be right back. I am going to do some ’business’ with her."

"Un." Shi Yuchun nodded innocently.

Sometime later, Su Yang entered Ruan Xiao Qing’s bedroom.

’A dual cultivator, huh? I wonder what they’ll do differently...’ Ruan Xiao Qing wondered to herself as she removed her clothes and sat on the bed.

"Aren’t you going to take your clothes off?" Ruan Xiao Qing asked Su Yang after seeing that he still had his clothes on when she was already naked on the bed.

"There’s no need to be so impatient." Su Yang said as he admired her beautiful and slender body.

He then loosened his robes and allowed them to slide off his body.

"Oh my..." Ruan Xiao Qing covered her mouth from shock after seeing the majestic sword between Su Yang’s legs, unconsciously comparing it with her husband’s tiny dagger.

’The difference is too much! It’s like comparing a mighty dragon to a baby snake! This is a real man! This is what I’ve been yearning for!’

A lustful smile appeared on Ruan Xiao Qing’s beautiful face without being aware of it herself, and she swallowed nervously, feeling as though her entire body was burning with desire.

’If it’s him, he’ll definitely be able to satisfy me!’ Ruan Xiao Qing cried inwardly. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
