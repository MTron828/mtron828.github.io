Chapter 695 Handshake

"Su Yang, I know my daughter may have made mistakes in the past, but I hope you can treat her with love as you did with me..." Feng Xindou pulled Su Yang to the side and whispered to him.

Su Yang smiled and said, "Don’t worry, I won’t treat her any differently because of what happened. And even though I may not be able to physically please you, my presence will still be here one way or another..."

"What do you mean by that?" Feng Xindou raised her eyebrows, seemingly puzzled by his last sentence.

Su Yang merely smiled before turning to look at Emperor Lian.

"Hey, take this and study it."

Emperor Lian quickly went to catch whatever Su Yang just threw at him.

"Even though your wife has recovered from her condition, she’s not completely safe, as she still needs to continuously release her Yin Qi to prevent it from happening again in the future. Therefore, as her husband, you will have to bear that responsibility and treat her with love and passion at least once a week. That piece of scroll contains a few techniques that will help you and your wife in multiple ways."

"If you continue to neglect your wife, someone else might take her away from you, and that person might be me, so it would be in your best interest to start loving her more." Su Yang said with a smile as he walked outside, dumbfounding Emperor Lian.

"Su Yang..." Even Feng Xindou couldn’t help but blush after hearing his words.

As for Lian Li, she was staring at her mother with a dazed look on her face, silently wondering to herself what happened between them during the treatment?

Sometime later, once Su Yang, the Xie Family, and Lian Li were outside, Su Yang retrieved the large flying ship and tossed it into the air before it expanded into the size of a real battleship.

Once everyone bored the ship, Su Yang navigated it to fly towards the Four Seasons Academy.

"Haaa..." Feng Xindou released a profound sigh as she watched the flying ship quickly disappear from the scene.

Seeing this, Emperor Lian couldn’t help but ask her, "Did something happen between the two of you?"

Hearing his question, Feng Xindou merely smiled and said, "He treated me like a woman, but you probably already know that, right? Su Yang wasn’t lying when he said that he might take me away if you don’t start loving me again."

"I-I wouldn’t dare to neglect you after what happened! I swear I will love you every day for the rest of our lives!" Emperor Lian said as he followed Feng Xindou back into the palace.

Meanwhile, Su Yang and the other returned to the Four Seasons Academy a few minutes later.

"Su Yang! You’re back! How did your meeting with Emperor Lian go? I didn’t think you would be gone for so long so I was beginning to worry something might have happened to you," Zhu Mengyi greeted him with a wide smile on her face while Zhu Jiayi expressed her desire to be held by Su Yang by waving her arms at him.

"You are right, something did happen, but it wasn’t anything troublesome," Su Yang said as he took Zhu Jiayi from her mother’s arms.

"Anyway, are you ready to leave? I can tell you about it later."

"Yes, I have already said my farewells to my mother and my friends in this place."

"Good, then we’ll go pick up Wu Jingjing before we leave for the Eastern Continent."

Once Zhu Mengyi was on the flying ship, Su Yang navigated it towards the Holy Sword Academy next.

Meanwhile, Sect Master Zhu watched as the flying ship and Zhu Mengyi disappeared from the Four Seasons Academy.

"Good luck, my little girl. I’m sure you’ll achieve great things with someone like Su Yang by your side."

A few minutes after Su Yang left the Four Seasons Academy, they reached the Holy Sword Academy, and Wu Jingjing was already waiting for him with Wu Jiang by her side.

"Are you leaving the Holy Central Continent now?" Wu Jiang asked him despite already knowing the answer.

"That’s right." Su Yang nodded.

"I see..." Wu Jiang looked at Wu Jingjing and then at Wu Min with a loving gaze.

"Hopefully we can meet again before I perish from this world," he sighed a moment later.

"Why must you say something so depressing before I leave? Are you doing this on purpose so I feel bad?" Wu Jingjing shook her head at him.

"Hahaha... That was not my intention, Jingjing," he laughed out loud, yet the sadness in his eyes could not be hidden.

"I will definitely see you again in the future, father," Wu Jingjing gave him a powerful hug before boarding the flying ship.

"You better keep your words and protect them properly, Su Yang, or I will haunt you even after my death," Wu Jiang said to him.

"I will willingly haunt myself if anything were to happen to them," Su Yang responded with a smile on his face.

"Then I leave my daughter in your care." Wu Jiang extended his hand for a handshake.

Su Yang looked at it for a moment before grabbing it and shaking Wu Jiang’s hand.

"Consider yourself lucky. Even though it’s only a handshake, I don’t willingly touch men often," Su Yang laughed.

"Hmph! You should consider yourself lucky for having someone like Wu Jingjing!" Wu Jiang quickly said. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

After their handshake, Su Yang boarded the flying ship with Wu Jingjing and Wu Min.

A few moments later, the flying ship began moving, and it disappeared from Wu Jiang’s view almost instantly.

Once the flying ship left the Holy Sword Academy, it flew straight over the Jade Sea and towards the Eastern Continent, completely leaving the Holy Central Continent.

"You’re also following us to the Eastern Continent, Your Highness?" Wu Jingjing asked Lian Li in a surprised voice after noticing her presence on the ship.

"Yes, and you can stop addressing me that way, as I am no longer a part of the Lian Family. Just call me ’Sister Li’ from now on," Lian Li said to her with a beautiful smile on her face.
