Chapter 760 - Another List of Medicine

Once Xiao Rong arrived at the Lian Family’s household, she spoke in a calm voice that resounded very loudly, startling everyone within the palace.

"Lian Li’s parents, come out!" Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

A few moments later, both Emperor Lian and Feng Xindou came out of the building with a serious and nervous expression on their face.

They flew before Xiao Rong and bowed to her while speaking in a respectful tone, "Welcome to the Lian Family, Senior. How may we assist you today?"

Even though they have never seen Xiao Rong before, they could tell at a glance that she was a profound expert who was stronger than both of them together.

’An extremely beautiful little girl, silver hair, and a face that resembles Fairy Su Yue’s facial appearance... Could this be the expert who nearly destroyed the Golden Lion Academy in a single night?! What does she want from us?!’ Emperor Lian cried inwardly as he guessed Xiao Rong’s identity.

And just as Feng Xindou opened her mouth, Xiao Rong said, "Su Yang sent me here, and he told me to receive some herbs from you."

"S-Su Yang? You’re with Su Yang?" Feng Xindou looked at her with a surprised look on her face.

Xiao Rong nodded.

"Oh... thank heavens..." Feng Xindou released a deep sigh of relief after learning Xiao Rong’s identity, and she continued to speak without feeling tense or nervous, "Please give me a moment, Senior. I’ll go grab the medicine right now."

Feng Xindou returned to the house to grab the medicine while Emperor Lian remained outside with Xiao Rong, feeling incredibly awkward and somewhat nervous due to Xiao Rong’s immense yet invisible aura.

"One more thing..." Xiao Rong suddenly said, startling Emperor Lian, "Patriarch Gold... Su Yang told me to tell you about what happened to him."

"Patriarch Gold? How is he related to Su Yang?" Emperor Lian raised his eyebrows.

Xiao Rong proceeded to explain to Emperor Lian about what happened to Patriarch Gold and how he fought Su Yang and brilliantly lost, even being sealed at the bottom of the Jade Sea.

"..."

Emperor Lian’s jaw dropped wide open and his eyes widened with shock.

"Patriarch Gold did what?! He went to the Eastern Continent trying to kidnap some woman— Su Yang’s woman?!" Emperor Lian was profoundly speechless after realizing the truth.

"Damn! And to think I’d been searching for him for the past year! What a waste of my damn effort!" Emperor Lian cursed loudly.

"Why are you cursing?" Feng Xindou suddenly returned and asked him.

"Well... it’s like this..."

Emperor Lian then explained the situation and recalled what Xiao Rong told him not long ago about Patriarch Gold and his deeds.

"What?! How dare he!" Feng Xindou exclaimed in an angry voice, and she continued, "I will personally deal with the Golden Lion Academy after this!"

A few moments later, Feng Xindou handed Xiao Rong a storage ring and said to her, "Everything that Su Yang asked for should be inside. In fact, we made sure there’s extra medicine inside," Feng Xindou.

Xiao Rong nodded and accepted the storage ring.

However, right as Xiao Rong turned around and prepared to leave, Feng Xindou suddenly said, "Please wait a minute! If you’re with Su Yang, have you seen my daughter Lian Li lately? How is she doing?"

"Lian Li..." Xiao Rong pondered for a few seconds before speaking, "Her stomach is growing bigger."

"Really?! That means she will be giving birth soon, dear!" Feng Xindou said to him with pure excitement on her face, even shaking his body with her hands.

"Our daughter is giving birth already? That’s much quicker than I’d expected!" Emperor Lian mumbled in a shocked voice, as he couldn’t have imagined that Lian Li would advance so quickly!

"D-Do you think we’ll be able to see our grandchildren once she’s born?" Feng Xindou asked her.

"I will ask Master," Xiao Rong said with a calm expression.

"Master?"

They looked at Xiao Rong with wide eyes.

Su Yang actually has someone this powerful as a servant? It’s no wonder why he’s always so overbearing and calm! If they also had someone like Xiao Rong as a servant, they’d be able to conquer the entire world with ease!

Sometime later, Xiao Rong returned to the Eastern Continent. However, since Su Yang had left for the Xie Family, she decided to go into his room and wait for him there.

Meanwhile, at the Xie Family.

"How’s your body, Xing’er?" Xie Wang sat on a chair beside Xie Xingfang, who was laying in her bed and gently caressing the bump on her stomach with a passionate gaze.

"I am feeling great," Xie Xingfang said, and she continued, "I am still in the middle stages of pregnancy so it isn’t anything too crazy."

After a moment of silence, Xie Wang asked her, "When are you going to tell your father about this? You’d managed to keep it a secret from him by pretending like you are doing secluded cultivation, but I doubt you’ll be able to keep this a secret until you give birth."

"I know, grandfather. I have been thinking about this lately, and I plan on telling him soon— sometime this week," Xie Xingfang said.

"Why not tell him today?"

A third voice suddenly resounded in the room, causing the two of them to turn and look at the window.

"Su Yang!" A bright smile appeared on Xie Xingfang’s face when she saw him.

"Since you’re here, I’ll leave you two alone." Xie Wang stood up and prepared to leave the room.

However, Su Yang stopped him and said, "Wait for a second, old man. I need to speak to you about something."

"What is it?" Xie Wang stopped and asked.

"I need the Xie Family’s help to find me these medicines," Su Yang handed him a long list.

"Again?" Xie Wang took a glance at the list, and his eyes immediately widened.

When Su Yang saw this, he said with a smile on his face, "Don’t worry, I will give you the money to buy these medicines this time."
