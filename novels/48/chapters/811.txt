Chapter 812 - Thanking Him Properly

After hearing Su Yang’s words, a stiff smile appeared on Doctor Sang’s face, and he spoke in a humble voice, "I didn’t say that, Fellow Daoist. If you’re offended by my words, it wasn’t my intention, and I apologize if that was the case. However, since I’ve come all the way here, it would feel like I’d wasted my time if I return now without doing anything, so I’ll do a quick check-up on the young lady just to make sure that everything is well. Hopefully, she’s perfectly cured as you’d claim."

Despite Doctor Sang’s humble words, there was a subtle hint of doubt and contempt within his gaze, almost like he didn’t believe that a nobody like Su Yang could possibly have more experience than him, who was widely recognized as the number one doctor in the Southern Continent.

A few minutes later, Doctor Sang went to Lu Youyi’s room to check on her, and to his surprise, Lu Youyi greeted him with a healthy smile on her face.

"Thank you for coming all the way here, Doctor Sang, but I am already healed," she said to him, unknowingly striking his pride with an invisible blade.

"T-That’s fine. I am just here to check on your health just to make sure there’s nothing wrong with your body. After all, Three Seasons Snakes are extremely rare and their victims are too few and far in between, hence why there are not many doctors who know how to treat their poison."

And he continued, "Even if you feel perfectly healthy, that might not be the case. Who knows, maybe there is still poison rooted deep within your body."

"You can check my body if you want, Doctor Sang, but I trust Su Yang," said Lu Youyi as she showed him her slender arm with a healthy complexion.

"..."

Doctor Sang was immediately baffled speechless by Lu Youyi’s seemingly flawless skin.

’D-Did he really cure her in such a short time? I don’t believe it!’ Doctor Sang was not convinced that someone else could treat the Three Seasons Snake’s poison, even treating it better and faster than him.

Doctor Sang proceeded to put his fingers on Lu Youyi’s wrist, and he used his spiritual energy to check her pulses and her internal body for any poison or injuries.

’N-None!’ Doctor Sang cried inwardly when he could not find anything wrong with Lu Youyi after checking her body over and over again.

"How is my condition, Doctor Sang? Su Yang did a great job curing me, right?" Lu Youyi asked him sometime later.

"How... How did he do it?" Doctor Sang suddenly asked her with a serious frown on his face. "There’s no antidote for the Three Seasons Snake’s poison as far as I’m aware, so how did he expel the poison in your body?"

"That’s..." Lu Youyi immediately blushed after recalling Su Yang’s treatment, and she said in a bashful voice, "I’m sorry, Doctor Sang, but I’d rather not say it..."

"Eh? Why not?" Doctor Sang looked at her with wide eyes. "I won’t tell anyone."

However, Lu Youyi still shook her head, and then she said, "I can only tell you the beginning."

And she proceeded to explain to Doctor Sang how Su Yang fed her some sort of pill before cutting her body with some powerful technique, causing the bad blood to spray out like a fountain.

Doctor Sang almost had a heart attack after listening about Su Yang’s ridiculous method of treatment. What kind of treatment would require one to have their body cut up like that?

"A-Anyway, there’s nothing wrong with your body— at least I cannot see anything wrong with it. I think you’ve made a complete recovery. Congratulations, young lady." Doctor Sang said to her with a defeated smile on his face.

"I know! Su Yang treated me very well, after all!" she nodded with a bright smile.

"Since I am no longer needed here, I shall take my leave here. After all, I still have many more patients to look after."

"Thank you for coming again, Doctor Sang!" Lu Youyi said to him.

After leaving her room, Lu Youyi’s parents asked Doctor Sang, "Well? How’s our daughter? Has she really recovered?"

Doctor Sang nodded and said, "I don’t know what that young man did to the young lady, but whatever he did, it helped the young lady make a complete recovery. I don’t think there will be any problems."

"Really?! That’s great to hear!" Lu Jin exclaimed.

Lu Duhan then extended his hand and showed Doctor Sang the storage ring resting on his palms, "Please, take this."

Doctor Sang looked at the storage ring for a moment before shaking his head, "I don’t deserve it. Give it to the young man who healed the young lady instead— he deserves every bit of it."

After saying such words, Doctor Sang left the Lu Family without turning around.

Lu Jin and Lu Duhan looked at each other with a dumbfounded gaze.

Sometime later, Su Yang entered Lu Youyi’s room, and he said to her, "Today will be your last treatment. After this, your body will no longer have any more poison, and regular medicine will do the job."

"Okay." Lu Youyi said.

Su Yang began massaging her body a few moments later, and the room became filled with Lu Youyi’s m.o.a.ning voice.

Half an hour later, Lu Youyi laid on the bed with a satisfied look on her face.

"Thank you... Su Yang..." she said to him.

"Don’t even mention it," said Su Yang.

"..."

"Su Yang, wait a second, don’t go yet." Lu Youyi suddenly grabbed him by the sleeves when Su Yang stood up and prepared to leave.

"What is it?" Su Yang turned around to see Lu Youyi’s face flushed with redness.

"I... still haven’t thanked you properly..." Lu Youyi said in a low voice.

She then grabbed his hands and placed them on her b.r.e.a.s.ts whilst spreading her legs and her slit.

"Su Yang... Allow me to thank you with my body..." she said to him with an enchanted look on her face.
