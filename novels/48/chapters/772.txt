Chapter 773 Twenty Immortal-Grade Techniques

Once Su Yang left the scene, Lian Li brought the little girl and Ruan Xiao Qing to the guest room where they were served tea and other snacks.

"Y-Your Highness, if you don’t mind me asking, what’s the Lian Family’s relationship with that man, Su Yang? Is he really Immortal Fairy Su Yue’s husband? He called himself a dual cultivator, too..."

"Indeed, Su Yang’s a dual cultivator. I don’t really know much about his relationship with Immortal Fairy Su Yue, but I guess you can call them partners. As for his relationship with the Lian Family..."

Lian Li pressed the robes around her stomach down to reveal the bump to Ruan Xiao Qing and continued, "He’s the father of my child."

"GOOD HEAVENS!" Ruan Xiao Qing stood up from her seat while shouting in a shocked voice, as she would’ve never imagined that Lian Li and Su Yang would be in that kind of relationship!

"H-He’s a dual cultivator, right? That means he should have a lot of cultivation partners! Why did you pick someone like him to conceive your child?" Ruan Xiao Qing asked Lian Li with clear disbelief on her face.

"The answer to that question is actually quite simple," Lian Li spoke with a calm expression on her face, and she continued, "It’s because I love him. And yes, there are other women besides myself in the family, but what does that matter? He may be a dual cultivator with many partners, but he loves all of us equally, and that’s all it really matters for me and the others, I believe."

"I...I see..." Ruan Xiao Qing mumbled despite not really understanding Lian Li’s feelings.

"As long as you are satisfied, Your Highness. I’m sorry if my remarks were rude." Ruan Xiao Qing said a moment later.

"I am more than satisfied," Lian Li said with a mysterious smile on her face.

Sometime later, Lian Li turned to look at the little girl who was calmly sipping on the tea in her hands this entire time.

"What is your name, little girl? And what is your relationship with Su Yang?" Lian Li asked her.

"Shi Yuchun," she responded after putting the tea down. "And... big brother hired me..."

"Huh? He hired you? For what?" Lian Li raised her eyebrows.

But alas, Shu Yuchun shook her head, "I don’t know. Big brother only told me to follow him and he’ll pay me."

"Uhhh..."

Lian Li and Ruan Xiao Qing looked at each other. If they didn’t know any better, they would’ve immediately locked up Su Yang after hearing such words from the little girl.

"Although I’m not sure what he’s thinking, Su Yang won’t treat you badly," Lian Li said with a stiff smile on her face.

Shi Yuchun nodded, "I know. Big brother is very kind."

Sometime later, Feng Xindou entered the room.

"Oh? Who are these guests?"

"Y-Your Majesty!" Ruan Xiao Qing stood up and bowed to Feng Xindou in a hasty manner.

"You are... the Ruan Family? Oh, this must be about the Dew of Life. Did Su Yang already convince you to give the Dew of Life to him?" Feng Xindou asked her.

"Eh... N-Not yet... We’re still in the middle of a negotiation."

"Is that so?" Feng Xindou nodded in a nonchalant manner, almost like she wasn’t too interested in their affairs.

"If you don’t mind me asking, why does Su Yang want the Dew of Life? What is he going to do with it? Although we have never used it, the Dew of Life is rumored to have the ability to revive even the dead!" Ruan Xiao Qing said.

"Now that you mention it, I also don’t know why he wants the Dew of Life. Perhaps you can enlighten us, Li’er." Feng Xindou turned to look at Lian Li.

"Well... this is the situation," Lian Li proceeded to explain to them about one of Su Yang’s partners who was having trouble conceiving, so Su Yang is going to heal her with those ingredients.

"Oh my... infertility? Now that’s a harsh fate for most women..." Feng Xindou shook her head in a solemn manner.

"Infertility..." Ruan Xiao Qing also turned silent. As a mother of three children, she couldn’t imagine what it would feel like to not have the ability to give birth as a woman, especially when most if not all women are expected to bear children by their partners.

Sometime later, Su Yang returned to them and said, "Okay, I am ready to go to the Ruan Family now." Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

"See you later, Su Yang." Lian Li said to him.

After leaving the Lian Family, Su Yang brought Ruan Xiao Qing and Shi Yuchun to the Ruan Family’s household.

"Here are a total of 20 Immortal-grade techniques that I believe will greatly benefit the Ruan Family. Take a look at them." Su Yang said as he placed 20 scrolls on the table, dumbfounding Ruan Xiao Qing speechless.

"T-Twenty Immortal-grade techniques?" Ruan Xiao Qing wouldn’t be surprised if there exists less than 20 Immortal-grade in this world, yet there were 20 of them laying on the table and she was only an arms-length away from them. It felt like she was almost dreaming at this moment.

A few moments later, Ruan Xiao Qing began looking through all 20 techniques.

’H-How am I supposed to pick which one I want? All of them are exceptional techniques that could change the foundation of the Ruan Family!’ Ruan Xiao Qing cried inwardly afterward.

"Take your time, I’ll go concoct the Beauty Preserving Pill in the meantime." Su Yang then sat down somewhere in the corner and pulled out an ordinary pill cauldron before he tossed in a few ingredients and began concocting the pill.

’He’s also an Alchemist?! Is there anything this man cannot do?!’ Ruan Xiao Qing stared at Su Yang’s figure with a gawking look on her face, but she didn’t have time to worry about Su Yang and continued to focus on the 20 cultivation techniques before her.
