Chapter 856 - Xiao Bai's Future

After visiting Yan Yan, Su Yang returned to the Yin Yang Pavilion to relax, and if anyone wanted to cultivate with him, they’d contact him using a communication jade slip.

Time passed in a flash, and before anyone was aware, almost an entire month had passed.

The news of Su Yang and Xie Xingfang’s celebration had spread throughout the entire Eastern Continent during this time, attracting a lot of attention, and the excitement for the celebration would only increase as it grew closer.

A week before the celebration, Fang Zhelan visited Su Yang to cultivate.

"Where’s Xiaoru? It’s rare to see you alone nowadays," Su Yang said to her after their cultivation session.

"Oh, she went training on the 3rd floor of the Immortal’s Treasury." Fang Zhelan said.

"I see..."

"Su Yang, do you know if there’s anything else I can do for Xiao Bai before we leave this world?" She suddenly asked him.

"What do you mean?"

"I intend on leaving Xiao Bai in this world so she can take care of the Profound Blossom Sect as its guardian spirit, and I was wondering if there’s anything I can do so that she won’t feel lonely when we leave."

"Hmmm..." Su Yang closed his eyes to ponder before speaking, "How about we create a new home for it? We have plenty of unused territories. We can turn these areas into Xiao Bai’s playground. Furthermore, we can find her a partner as well."

"A partner for Xiao Bai? Where do we find something like that?" Fang Zhelan raised her eyebrows.

"Xiao Bai is a Snow Tiger, they are not very picky when it comes to partners. As for how she’ll find her partner— it’s very simple, actually. We just let her wander the world until she finds a suitable partner."

"What? Let Xiao Bai wander outside the Profound Blossom Sect? That sounds extremely dangerous! What if something happens to her?!"

Su Yang chuckled and said, "Calm down. Do you think Xiao Bai is still a baby like when you first picked it up? She’s a grown Guardian Spirit that’s at the Heavenly Spirit Realm. She can leave the sect without any problems."

"Now that you mention it..." Feng Zhelan didn’t really take Xiao Bai’s strength into account since she was used to treating Xiao Bai like a pet.

"Trust me, there’s barely anything in the Eastern Continent that could threaten Xiao Bai at her current state. They’d need an army to defeat her. However, with the Xie Family and so many other powerful backgrounds assisting us, who will dare to touch Xiao Bai?"

"Furthermore, even though Guardian Spirits are supposed to protect places, they’re not meant to stay in one place forever. They’re just like cultivators in the sense that they also need to travel the world and hope for fortunate encounters so that they can grow stronger, perhaps even evolve."

"Evolve? You mentioned something like that before." Feng Zhelan said. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

"Guardian Spirits can further enhance their bloodline and evolve into stronger beings. However, it’s incredibly rare and requires a massive amount of effort."

"I see... Okay, I will tell Xiao Bai about it later."

Sometime later, Feng Zhelan left the place, and Su Yang cleaned his body before going to his next appointment.

The following day, Liu Lanzhi and the Su Family gathered outside the Yin Yang Pavilion.

"Are we all ready?" Su Yang asked them.

Once they all nodded, Su Yang turned to look at Qiuyue and said, "Go ahead."

Qiuyue then retrieved her large flying treasure so that they could carry everyone at once.

A few minutes later, they stopped above the Xie Family and descended from the ship.

"Welcome, everybody." Xie Wang greeted them.

"Just make yourselves at home like usual," he said to them before approaching Su Yang.

"Xing’er is waiting for you in her room."

Su Yang nodded, "Thank you."

While the Su Family settled in the Xie Family’s household, Su Yang went to look for Xie Xingfang inside her room.

"What do you think, Su Yang?" Xie Xingfang welcomed him with a bright smile and luxurious red robes on her body.

"You look very beautiful," Su Yang kept his praises simple and straightforward even though there was so much that could’ve been said regarding her appearance.

"Thank you, Su Yang." Xie Xingfang responded with a beaming smile on her face.

"I don’t want to dirty this before the celebration so I’ll take it off now." Xie Xingfang said a moment later before she carefully took off her red clothes.

"Is everyone here?" she asked him after storing away the clothes.

"Yes, everyone is here."

"Now we just wait for the celebration to start, huh?" Xie Xingfang mumbled.

Meanwhile, families from across the Eastern Continent could be seen traveling towards Snowfall City, filling up the entire city.

After a family arrived at the city, the first thing they did was visit the Xie Family with a carriage of treasures and gifts.

The Xie Family’s reception hall was filled with gifts because of this. In fact, they had received so many gifts and treasures that they needed to start using the courtyard to store the gifts.

"Heavens... Just the gifts alone could probably fetch a few hundred million spirit stones..." The servants accepting and organizing the gifts were blown away by the number of gifts they were receiving.

Even Lord Xie and his late wife’s celebration didn’t receive half as many gifts as Su Yang and Xie Xingfang’s celebration, and there are still a couple more days until the actual celebration!

Meanwhile, Lord Xie was busy welcoming all of the guests.

"Congratulations, Your Majesty. Her Highness will definitely live a blissful life with someone like Su Yang as her partner."

"Congratulations, Your Majesty! Long live the Xie Family!"

"Hahaha! Thank you all— thank you!" Lord Xie could be seen laughing non-stop during the next few days.
