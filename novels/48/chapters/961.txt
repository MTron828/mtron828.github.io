Chapter 962 I Am Also a Doctor

"Mmmm~!"

"Aaaaah~!"

Mei Ying moaned loudly as Su Yang massaged all over her body, starting from her neck until he reached her feet.

Once Su Yang was finished massaging her back, he had her flip over so that he could massage the front of her body.

Mei Ying gazed at him with a yearning look on her beautiful face as Su Yang massaged her body with respect by allowing her to feel extreme pleasure without touching any of her private parts, keeping things pure for Mei Xing who was watching from the sidelines.

Of course, Mei Ying’s lustful expressions were anything but pure. However, as someone who was born in the City of Pleasure, Mei Xing was used to these kinds of things, so she remained unfazed, acting like it was only normal.

After working as an escort for many years, Mei Ying has long gotten used to the sensation of ’pleasure’, and she had even forgotten what it was like to moan genuinely after spending many years faking her moans to act like she was enjoying whatever her customers were doing to her numbed body.

However, after experiencing Su Yang’s hand techniques, she immediately began moaning genuinely, and it felt as natural as breathing.

Su Yang continued to massage Mei Ying’s body until he loosened all of her stiffened muscles, allowing her body to finally move properly.

The massage lasted for over an hour, and at the end, the bed was soaked in Mei Ying’s sweat and Yin Qi.

"Haaa... Haaa... Haaaa..." Mei Ying finally had a chance to breathe properly when she stopped moaning, yet her body continued to twitch uncontrollably.

Su Yang removed the formation a moment later and said to Mei Xing, "I am done."

Mei Xing nodded and approached the bed before asking Mei Ying in a calm yet curious voice, "Mother, how was the Manager’s massage?"

"..."

Mei Ying looked at her daughter who had a cheeky look on her face and said, "I can see why his massage parlor became popular in such a short time. I thought you were exaggerating, but after experiencing it for myself, I understand everything."

"Hehe..." Mei Xing chuckled after hearing her mother praising Su Yang’s skills, acting as though she was the one being praised.

"How do you feel?" Su Yang asked her a moment later.

"I have never felt better," she quickly responded.

And she continued, "My body feels so relaxed but also different at the same time that I am doubting whether it’s actually my own body or not."

"That’s good to hear. However, no matter how effective my massage is, you still need to properly rest your body, so you should spend the next few days resting your body."

"The next few days...? But what about my work? I cannot just stop working..." She said with a worried look on her face.

"Don’t worry about it. I will reserve you for the next week so you won’t see any customers."

However, the worried expression on her face remained, and she said, "As much as I appreciate it... I have a lot of customers waiting for me... If I don’t tend to them..."

Su Yang noticed a hint of fear within Mei Ying’s voice and deep within her eyes.

’I see...’ He instantly understood why Mei Ying was nervous about not working when he saw her reaction.

He closed his eyes and took a deep breath.

"Mei Xing, can you leave us alone for a few minutes?" Su Yang suddenly asked her.

"O-Okay." Mei Xing nodded, leaving the room the next moment.

"I-Is something wrong?" Mei Ying asked him afterward.

Su Yang created a formation around them again and said, "You know, I am not only a masseur... I am also a doctor."

"Eh?" Mei Ying’s eyes widened with surprise.

"When I massaged your body just now, I also took a look inside your body, and you... You’re sick, aren’t you?" Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Mei Ying realized where Su Yang was going with this, and her body trembled with fear.

"P-Please! Don’t tell Mei Xing about my condition! I will do anything you ask me to!"

Su Yang narrowed his eyes on her and said, "If you continue working in that condition... You won’t live long. In fact, you’ll most likely die before Mei Xing could even grow up to be an adult."

Mei Ying’s body trembled some more after hearing Su Yang’s cold words.

She bit her lips and said, "I know, but I don’t think that’s a bad thing. If I die, Mei Xing will no longer need to worry about me, and she will finally be able to leave the City of Pleasure. As long as I am alive, she will not leave me behind, and I am nothing but a burden to her."

Hearing her words, Su Yang sighed out loud, "You know, I have met many women you like throughout my life— mothers who think they’re doing their children a favor by dying. However, none of these women knew how much pain and suffering their children had to endure after their death because, well, they’re dead."

"Why do you feel the need to die to give your children a better life? What sense does that make?" Su Yang asked her.

"B-But if I don’t die, how will she ever leave my side? I have only been a toy for another’s pleasure ever since the first day I became an adult! Someone like me won’t survive for long outside this city, but Mei Xing is different! She has many choices in life! And with her intelligence, she will be able to overcome every obstacle before her! I am sure of it!"

Su Yang then said, "Honestly, I have no business in your situation, nor will I try to convince you to change your mind, but I will let you know that Mei Xing won’t act like how you think she will once you die. She may be intelligent for someone her age, but you must remember... She is still a child."

After a moment of silence, Su Yang retrieved a pill from his storage pouch and placed it on the bed.

"That pill will cure your body, but whether you accept it or not will be entirely up to you."
