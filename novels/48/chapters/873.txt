Chapter 874 - Returning to the Boar Tribe (2)

"Forget it... If you wish to enter the Mirror of Darkness, that is entirely up to you." Lebao shook his head.

"Anyways, let me show you around the Boar Tribe for the last time before you leave." He then said.

Qin Lianyu nodded and followed Lebao and his family around the Boar Tribe.

Meanwhile, Su Yang was surrounded by the ladies in the Boar Tribe.

"Su Yang! Do you remember me?" A pretty young lady suddenly approached him with glistening eyes.

Su Yang smiled and said, "Of course."

This young lady was one of the thirty-two women who’d assisted his recovery after his fight with the Dragon Tribe by sharing a bed with him.

"Hehe... Since you’re here, do you think we can do that again?" She asked him.

"Only for a few minutes," he nodded with a smile.

"That’s more than enough time!" The young lady nodded before dragging him into her home.

Inside, Su Yang inserted his rod into the young lady’s cave while fully clothed.

After thrusting for a few minutes without rest, Su Yang released his Yang Qi inside her body.

"Aaah~! I feel like you’ve improved since the last time," she said to him afterward with a satisfied look on her red face.

"Perhaps." Su Yang smiled.

Su Yang left the place shortly after.

"Hey, Su Yang. Remember me?" This m.a.t.u.r.e woman with large peaks and a slim body asked him while winking at him in a seductive manner.

Su Yang chuckled, "I remember everyone that helped me."

"Do you have some time right now? A couple of minutes should be enough," she then said.

"Does your husband know about this? I also remember how unhappy he looked afterward."

"He won’t know about it," she said in a low voice.

"How can you be so sure? You sound confident." Su Yang raised his eyebrows.

A bittersweet smile appeared on her face, and she spoke, "Because he’s no longer with us. He died in an accident last month while he went hunting."

"Oh... I’m sorry for bringing it up." Su Yang apologized to her.

"It’s okay, but if you want to make it up to me..." The woman then lifted her clothes slightly in a revealing manner.

"I have been lonely since then," she said.

Su Yang nodded and said, "Let’s go."

The woman immediately smiled and took him to her room, where they cultivated intensively for almost half an hour.

Of course, Su Yang notified Qin Liangyu before they started so she didn’t have to wonder where he went.

While Su Yang cultivated with the women in the Boar Tribe, Lebao showed Qin Liangyu everything he’s changed or improved in the Boar Tribe.

"The Boar Tribe has definitely improved significantly ever since I left. I knew it was the right decision to make you the next Chief. Congratulations, Lebao." Qin Liangyu said to him.

"Thank you, Senior Qin. And as much as I hate that man for taking you from the Boar Tribe, I have to give him some credit. If he didn’t protect the Boar Tribe from the Lion Tribe and the Dragon Tribe, we wouldn’t even have a Boar Tribe today." Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

"Yes... Su Yang, he’s a wonderful man— much more than I’d initially thought when I first left with him. I’m really glad I decided to follow him," she said.

"So you don’t regret leaving the tribe, huh?" Lebao said with a bittersweet smile on his face.

"As brutal as it sounds, I don’t regret it even the slightest." Qin Liangyu said with a smile.

"Well, good luck, Senior Qin. Although I don’t know what’s on the other side of the mirror, I wish you and him the best of luck." Lebao said to her.

"Thank you, Lebao. And I also wish you, your family, and the Boar Tribe the best. I won’t forget this place or any of you," Qin Liangyu said.

Sometime later, after Lebao finished showing Qin Liangyu around the tribe, she prepared to leave the place alone.

"Where’s the Savior? You’re not leaving with him?" Leobao asked her when he didn’t see him around.

Qin Liangyu chuckled and said, "He will be staying in the Boar Tribe for a little bit longer since he went to visit a couple of his old partners, so I will be heading back first. I hope you won’t mind it."

Lebao was speechless. As long as Su Yang stays away from his current wife, he couldn’t care less what he is doing with the other women in the tribe.

A few hours after Qin Liangyu left the Boar Tribe, Su Yang finally left.

Of course, he didn’t expect to stay in the tribe for longer than even Qin Liangyu, but whenever he was finished with one, another of his old partners would show up and ask him to cultivate with her.

Eventually, Su Yang cultivated with all 32 women that he’d cultivated with before including a few new ones before leaving the Boar Tribe with a refreshed smile on his face.

Compared to the women in the Eastern Continent, the women in the Boar Tribe were much more intense.

"Did you have fun?" Qin Liangyu asked him when he returned to the flying ship.

"Although it was shorter than last time, it was definitely much better." Su Yang chuckled.

"What about your tour? How was the Boar Tribe?"

"It’s doing great— much better than I’d expected. The living conditions have improved, and the food supply is great. I can leave this world without any worries after seeing that," she said with a relieved smile.

"So you have been worried about them, huh?"

Qin Liangyu nodded, "Just a tad bit. I’m glad Lebao was able to change. He’s like a completely different individual now."

"You may not realize it, but you have also changed a lot since you left." Su Yang said to her.

"Really? I hope it’s for the better."

"Of course. You’re less timid and much more m.a.t.u.r.e."

"Thank the heavens..." Qin Liangyu sighed in relief after hearing his words.
