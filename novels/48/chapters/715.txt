Chapter 716 - Four Peerless Beauties in the Celestial Pond

"Aaah~!"

"Aaaahn~!"

"Aaaaaaahhh~!"

Xie Xingfang m.o.a.ned passionately as Su Yang had his fingers firmly wrapped around her slender arms and pounded her l.u.s.tful body from behind.

The two of them have been cultivating for many hours now, as Su Yang cultivated with Xie Xingfang without using any dual cultivation techniques, allowing her to endure it for much longer.

After a few more minutes, Su Yang released his Yang Qi into her hole for the dozenth time, and the excess Yang Qi flowed into the Celestial Pond.

"Haa... haaa... haaaa... I need a break, Su Yang..." Xie Xingfang said afterward.

"Okay." Su Yang nodded, and Xie Xingfang sat in the Celestial Pond a moment later like she was taking a casual bath.

"You can call the others in here if you want," Xie Xingfang suddenly said.

Su Yang then said, "Watch this."

He closed his eyes and remained silent for the next few seconds.

Meanwhile, inside their room in the Xie Family’s household, Wu Jingjing, Zhu Mengyi, and Lian Li could suddenly feel their Family Seals heating up, almost as though it was beckoning them.

"This is... Su Yang?"

They exchanged glances with each other before turning to look in the direction of the Celestial Pond.

"I think Su Yang is calling us through the Family Seal," Wu Jingjing said.

"I am also getting that feeling!" Zhu Mengyi agreed.

"Let’s head to the Celestial Pond and see if that’s the case." Lian Li said. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

A few moments later, they all flew towards the Celestial Pond.

"Su Yang? What was that feeling coming from the Family Seal? Did you call for us?" Wu Jingjing asked him after they entered the portal to the Celestial Pond.

"Yes, I summoned all of you here so we can cultivate together," Su Yang nodded his head with a smile.

"To cultivate?" They turned to look at Xie Xingfang, who was sitting in the Celestial Pond with an exhausted yet satisfied expression on her face.

"You don’t have to if you don’t want to," Su Yang said to them.

"Nonsense! I would never refuse to cultivate with you!" Zhu Mengyi said, and then she continued, "However... who’s going to take care of the babies while we cultivate?"

Hearing her question, Su Yang snapped his fingers, instantly creating a large black square-shaped formation not far away from the Celestial Pond.

"You can just leave them inside— they’ll sleep through the whole thing." Su Yang said with a smile.

Wu Jingjing and Zhu Mengyi walked into the formation a moment later that was as spacious as a small room, and it felt as though they’d suddenly entered the void, but they were surrounded by flickering stars, almost like they were really in the starry sky.

"What is this place? I am getting sleepy just from standing in here" Wu Jingjing asked as she suddenly began yawning.

"It’s a formation that naturally puts people to sleep, the background is just there to make it look pretty. I use it to put the kids to sleep whenever I cultivate with their mother so that we won’t be disturbed..." Su Yang casually said.

"As expected of you, Su Yang, to have something like this in his sleeves..." Zhu Mengyi said with a dazed expression on her face.

"We still need a bed for—"

Before Wu Jingjing could even finish her sentence, Su Yang waved his sleeves, sending a mattress towards her way.

"..."

Wu Jingjing was speechless. She didn’t think he would be this prepared.

A few moments after putting Wu Min and Zhu Jiayi on the soft mattress beside each other, their mothers watched as they fell asleep within a heartbeat.

"Wow... What a wonderful technique this is— Maybe I should learn this for myself when I need some rest..." Wu Jingjing said.

"How long will they be asleep for?" Zhu Mengyi asked.

"The formation doesn’t forcefully put them asleep, so they’ll wake up normally whenever it happens," Su Yang said.

"Then we need to hurry up and cultivate before they wake up!" Zhu Mengyi said as she quickly removed her clothes and entered the Celestial Pond.

Wu Jingjing and Lian Li smiled and also joined them a moment later.

Once the Celestial Pond was filled with four heavenly goddesses that could topple even an entire kingdom with their beauty alone, Su Yang began pleasing all of them at once.

The water in the Celestial Pond splattered everywhere as they cultivated, and very quickly the ladies’ Yin Qi and Su Yang’s Yang Qi would fuse with the golden water in the Celestial Pond, creating a unique liquid that would boost their cultivation base significantly.

Su Yang continued to cultivate with the beauties without any breaks for nearly an entire day until the babies woke up and began crying for their mothers.

When that happened, the mothers left the Celestial Pond to tend their daughter, but Lian Li and Xie Xingfang remained in the Celestial Pond and continued to cultivate with Su Yang.

Although it was an awkward feeling at first for the two princesses that had never cultivated in a group before, after being around each other and listening to each other m.o.a.ning for some time, they eventually got used to it.

"Well? What do you think? Did you enjoy it? If not, that’s fine too, as I’ll make sure we will only do it privately in the future," Su Yang asked the two princesses as they sat beside him with his arms wrapped around their shoulders.

"It was definitely a unique experience... I like it." Lian Li said as she rested her head on his shoulders.

Xie Xingfang spoke afterward, "Although I don’t dislike it, and I don’t mind doing it occasionally, I still prefer having you to myself."

Su Yang nodded and said, "I understand— I will keep that in mind."

"Anyway, because I forcefully restored the Celestial Pond, it won’t last seven days like previously, and we have at most a few more hours before it dries out again."

Lian Li nodded and said, "Then let’s continue for a few more hours."

"I like that idea," Su Yang chuckled, and they returned to cultivating.
