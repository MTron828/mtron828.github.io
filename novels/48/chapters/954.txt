Chapter 955 Practice

"Manager, I am back!" Mei Xing said after entering the massage parlor.

"Already?" Su Yang stopped cultivating to look at her.

"My mother is currently working, so I won’t be able to see her until she gets off work at midnight," she nodded.

"So I decided to come back here. I hope you won’t mind my presence, Manager."

"My name is Xiao Yang." Su Yang said to her.

"My name is Mei Xing," she then responded with an introduction despite already telling him her name before.

Su Yang smiled and said, "I mean you don’t have to call me manager. Just call me Xiao Yang."

However, Mei Xing shook her head and said, "I cannot do that, Manager. That would be disrespectful of me."

"Do as you please," Su Yang quickly gave up.

He then said, "Since you’re already here, do you want to practice a little before we open tomorrow? You have zero experience as a receptionist, right?" Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Mei Xing nodded and said, "I was hoping for the same thing, Manager."

Su Yang then stood up and pointed at the reception desk, "Stand there—"

"You’re not tall enough, huh?" Su Yang then moved one of the customers’ chairs and placed it behind the desk for her to stand on.

Mei Xing then stood on the chair, allowing her to see the door and the rest of the room properly.

A moment later, Su Yang said, "I will now pretend to be a customer, so treat me as such."

He then walked outside the massage parlor and even closed the door.

A few seconds later, Su Yang opened the doors and walked inside with a calm look on his face.

"I’d like a massage," he said.

However, Mei Xing apologized in a calm voice, "I apologize for the inconvenience, but this massage parlor is only for female customers."

Su Yang’s eyes widened when he heard Mei Xing’s words since he didn’t tell her about that, and after a moment of silence, he burst out laughing and said, "That’s pretty damn good. I truly didn’t expect that. Alright, you win this one. However, treat me like a female customer next."

Mei Xing nodded.

Su Yang then walked back outside for another minute before returning.

"Welcome to Heavenly Massage! How can we help you today?" Mei Xing asked him with a welcoming smile on her face.

Despite her childish voice, her demeanor was quite mature.

"I’d like a massage," said Su Yang.

"It will cost 5 medium-grade spirit stones for a thirty-minute massage if you don’t mind."

"Five medium-grade spirit stones for a mere massage?! That’s daylight robbery!" Su Yang suddenly started complaining to test Mei Xing.

And he continued, "The other massage parlors only cost half of that! Why does this place cost so much more? It’s just a massage!"

While it was true that Su Yang’s massage parlor charged more than others, he hasn’t had a single complaint from his customers since he started the business.

In fact, he had multiple people offer him ten times the amount just to extend the massage sessions for another half an hour!

"The price was decided by the quality of the massage, and the Manager has the best hand techniques in the entire Pink Light District according to all of his clients. Furthermore, the majority of the customers that have gotten a massage at this place agree with the price." Mei Xing said.

"Oh? Do you have any proof to back up such claims? Or are you simply farting to make me shut up?" Su Yang continued to pressure her.

"Of course." Mei Xing then took a moment to look inside the drawers before retrieving a scroll.

"All of the names on this scroll are customers currently waiting to receive a massage by the Manager, and there are hundreds of names here, not counting the hundreds of satisfied customers who already received a massage from this place at the same price."

"If you still don’t believe me, you can schedule an appointment with the Manager yourself, but you don’t have to pay until after the massage, and if you found the massage unsatisfactory, you won’t have to pay anything."

Su Yang smiled and said, "Are you sure you don’t have any experience as a receptionist? You look pretty damn experienced to me."

Mei Xing nodded.

"Then I have a few questions for you."

"How did you know about the list?"

"I heard about it from others, but I didn’t really expect to find a list inside the drawers," she said.

"What about your last sentence? About not needing to pay until after the massage? I don’t have any rules like that. What if the customer isn’t satisfied and leaves without paying? That would be pretty bad for business, no?"

Mei Xing then responded in a clear voice, "I have confidence in the Manager’s abilities, so I am not worried about any customer leaving unsatisfied."

"Oh? What makes you so confident?"

"Although I have never experienced the massage myself, I can tell just by looking at the customers after they leave the massage parlor and the look on their faces when they speak about their experience here."

"Also, if the Manager’s massage wasn’t very good, it wouldn’t be this popular so quickly after it opened." Mei Xing explained to him where her confidence came from.

"Not bad." Su Yang nodded with an approved look on his face.

"Alright, let’s go through a few more scenarios before we call it a day."

Mei Xing nodded, and they proceeded to practice for another hour.

Once they were done, Su Yang began telling her about the massage parlor a little more and his expectations for her.

Time passed extremely quickly, and before they realized it, it was already midnight.

"I will see you tomorrow at sunrise." Su Yang said to her.

"See you tomorrow, and goodnight, Manager."

After leaving the massage parlor, Mei Xing returned straight to her mother’s side at her workplace.

Meanwhile, Su Yang sat in the massage room and proceeded to cultivate in silence for the rest of the night.
