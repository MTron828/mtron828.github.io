Chapter 913 - Frozen Azure Cave

"Divine Sword!"

Su Yang tossed the small sword emitting an otherworldly aura at the magical beast ahead, stabbing it directly between its eyes.​​

The magical beast released a painful cry that was loud enough to shake the trees and ground.

"Xiao Rong!" Su Yang called out to her.

Xiao Rong then used her spiritual energy to strike the magical beast’s mind, halting its movement for a split second. During that split second, Su Yang used the majority of his spiritual energy to create a powerful Sword Will that could kill the magical beast in a single strike.

After killing the magical beast, they immediately ran away from the area that would soon become a battlefield for other magical beasts fighting over the corpse.

They would repeat this process every time they encountered a magical beast, and although it was extremely exhausting for Su Yang, he continued to endure it, as they were so close to reaching the Frozen Azure Cave. Furthermore, whenever he thought about meeting Luo Ziyi again, he would gain some energy back and continue pushing further.

Of course, there were encounters with magical beasts that were even stronger than Xiao Rong.

When this happened, they could only run away and pray to the heavens that they don’t get caught by the magical beast.

Fortunately for them, the magical beasts they could only run away from were powerful but slow entities— slow enough for Su Yang and Xiao Rong to escape unscathed.

Their movement techniques were major contributors as well, as Su Yang’s Nine Astral Steps was one of the best movement techniques in the Four Divine Heavens while Xiao Rong was naturally quick on her feet.

Their journey continued for a few more days until it was the time of the meeting.

However, they were still not at the Frozen Azure Cave.

They were close, but they weren’t there just yet, and it’d take them another two days to reach the area if they continued to move at their current pace. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

"Master..." Xiao Rong looked at him, who was sitting on the ground and cultivating.

"I know, we’re late. But we’re not too far away, and I really need to recover some of my spiritual energy. If we continue at my current state, I won’t have enough spiritual energy to kill the next magical beast if we run into one."

"We may be late, but Ziyi won’t immediately leave because we’re late. She’s a patient woman. That’s why I picked her out of everyone available at the sect, as I was afraid that we wouldn’t make it in time." Su Yang said.

Xiao Rong nodded.

A few hours later, once Su Yang recovered the majority of his spiritual energy, they continued to move again.

As they got closer to the Frozen Azure Cave, Su Yang noticed that the Devil Blood Mist was getting stronger and thicker.

It was near transparent at first, but the mist is now so incredibly thick that he could no longer see the ground.

Seeing this, Su Yang said, "Xiao Rong, let’s slow down."

As much as he wanted to continue moving at the same pace, he truly didn’t want to encounter the Red-Faced Lizard.

"The Red-Faced Lizard is not only powerful but it has a special ability that can spit out poisonous saliva that travels as fast as a flying treasure and nearly impossible to dodge, and unlike the mist it releases, its saliva is incredibly poisonous and could instantly kill us if it even touches it."

"The only way to defend against such an ability is to cover yourself in spiritual energy that it cannot penetrate. However, neither of us are powerful enough to block it with our spiritual energy, so we can only avoid it."

Xiao Rong nodded, and they slowed down.

Su Yang lifted his arm and pointed at the peak of the mountain that was at the end of the mountain valley.

"The Frozen Azure Cave is at the peak of this mountain." Su Yang said.

However, there was one problem. The mountain itself was incredibly tall and reached the heavens, and there didn’t seem to be any paths that they could walk to go to the top, leaving them with only one option.

"In order to get up there, we’ll need to fly, but that might attract the aerial magical beasts around us. I can even sense three of them flying around us as I speak. They’ll definitely notice us and attack us before we can reach the entrance if we just fly up there."

"Even if we manage to get up there, the Frozen Azure Cave is large enough to host magical beasts inside, but we probably don’t have to worry about that, since Ziyi should’ve taken care of them if she’s inside."

"Actually, now that I think about it, it should be fine even if we attract the magical beasts. As long as we reach the Frozen Azure Cave, Ziyi will take care of them for us." Su Yang then came to this realization.

Su Yang then took a deep breath and said, "Are you ready for this, Xiao Rong?"

She nodded.

Su Yang retrieved the marble that could teleport them if something goes wrong and held it in his grasp so that they could teleport to safety in an instant.

’Oh, Ziyi, I really hope you’re in there...’ Su Yang sighed inwardly as he started flying toward the peak of the mountain.

Of course, the magical beasts flying in the sky noticed Su Yang and Xiao Rong flying in the sky.

The instant they noticed the two of them, they began flying in their direction.

Although the magical beasts were hundreds of miles away, they closed the distance within minutes.

’Che!’

Su Yang knew that they wouldn’t make it to the Frozen Azure Cave before the magical beasts reached them, and they were too powerful for him or Xiao Rong to handle, so he used his other hand that wasn’t holding the marble and reached for the black pouch hanging by his waist, retrieving a yellow talisman a moment later.
