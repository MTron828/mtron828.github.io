Chapter 777 Pill of Rebirth

"Get out of my face! I don’t want to hear a single peep from you!" Ruan Xiao Qing pointed at the door and shouted.

Ruan Zongze opened his mouth but no words came out, and he lowered his head in a shameful manner before walking out the door.

Meanwhile, Su Yang returned to the Lian Family with Shi Yuchun beside him.

"Welcome back, Su Yang. Did you obtain the Dew of Life this time?" Lian Li greeted him shortly after he entered the building.

"Yes, this is the Dew of Life." Su Yang showed her the glass bottle with a single droplet of liquid inside.

"What...? That’s the Dew of Life? There’s so little of it!" Lian Li mumbled in a surprised voice.

Su Yang chuckled and said, "Don’t let its appearance fool you. Even though it’s only a droplet of liquid that’s the size of an ant, it’s a powerful treasure that is also one of the most important ingredients that is needed to cure Liqing’s infertility."

"Is that so? How many do we need now?" she then asked.

"Eight more. There are nine ingredients required for the pill that’ll cure her infertility, and it would be a miracle if we can even gather half of them in this world." Su Yang sighed.

"Is this cure really that powerful? It only fixes infertility, right? I cannot imagine why curing something that seems so simple would require such a list of valuable ingredients." Lian Li said.

"The Pill of Rebirth that I am preparing to concoct is not only for infertility, as it will reconstruct every organ within one’s body, which includes their meridians and Dantian, essentially giving them a second chance in life. In other words, I can give a cripple who cannot cultivate this pill and he’ll be able to cultivate afterward like he’d experienced a rebirth."

"There exists such a powerful pill?!" Lian Li was dumbfounded, as she has always believed that someone with a crippled cultivation body cannot be cured!

"Do you really need something so powerful for Sister Liqing’s infertility, though? Aren’t there other methods to cure her that don’t involve the Pill of Rebirth? It might be quicker that way, after all."

"Yes, there are many other methods that can cure Liqing’s infertility problem, and I can even do it in less than a single day if I wanted to. However, I want the best for Liqing, and the Pill of Rebirth is the best even if it might take a little bit longer since it will affect her cultivation and other things that will greatly benefit her in the long run. This applies to everyone in the family including you, Li’er. If there’s a chance, I will opt for the best option for you if possible."

"Su Yang..." Lian Li nodded with a loving gaze.

Sometime later, Su Yang asked, "Where’s your mother?"

"Oh, she’s inside her room, and she told me to tell you that she’s ’ready’." Lian Li said.

Su Yang nodded and said, "Okay, I will be with her shortly."

"By the way, this is Shi Yuchun, and she’ll be working for the Profound Blossom Sect in the future so we’ll drop her off before going to the other continents later."

"Okay." Lian Li nodded.

"Anyway, it’s about time I go see your mother. I have been making her wait long enough," Su Yang said as he walked away.

"Un." Lian Li nodded.

"You can join us whenever you want. It’ll be a unique experience." Su Yang chuckled as he disappeared into the hallway.

"Me? Joining your cultivation session with my mother?" Lian Li stared at Su Yang’s disappearing back with a gawking look on her face, as she cannot even begin to imagine cultivating with Su Yang in the same room as her mother.

Sometime later, Su Yang knocked on Feng Xindou’s room.

"Can I come inside?" Su Yang spoke from the outside.

"Yes! Come inside!" Feng Xindou responded a second later.

Su Yang then pushed the door open and walked into the room.

And to his surprise, Feng Xindou pounced on him like a tiger in heat the moment he stepped foot inside the room.

"Su Yang... I know you’re purposefully teasing me by making me wait so long after agreeing to satisfy my body..." Feng Xindou said to him with her body naked and with Yin Qi flowing down her legs like a river.

"As an Empress, you should learn to be more patient," Su Yang said to her while Feng Xindou removed his clothes for him.

"Who cares about that? I am not the Empress in the bedroom— only a dissatisfied woman yearning for satisfaction!"

Su Yang chuckled and said, "I like the way you think."

He then lowered his body and scooped Feng Xindou’s body off the ground before carrying her to the bed like a princess.

After tossing her on the bed, Su Yang immediately spread her legs and inserted his rod into her cave, as it was already wet enough without any foreplay. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

"Aaaaah~ Yes! This is it! This is the feeling of satisfaction that my body has been longing for!" Feng Xindou released a satisfied moan as Su Yang ravaged her lustful hole with his beast.

A few hours later, Feng Xindou laid on the bed with her body twitching and her hole leaking with Yang Qi.

"Thank you, Su Yang..." Feng Xindou mumbled to him in a low voice.

Su Yang nodded and said, "Don’t even mention it. This is simply ’treatment’. Nothing more, nothing less."

Feng Xindou nodded.

"Anyway, do you want to remain here while I continue treating you or would you like to move to the Profound Blossom Sect in the meantime? It’ll be a lot more convenient if I can treat you whenever you need it without needing to travel a million miles. Of course, it doesn’t require much effort for me since I have the flying treasure. It’ll be all up to you." Su Yang asked her.

"Hmmm... Give me some time to think about it." Feng Xindou said.

"Okay." Su Yang nodded.
