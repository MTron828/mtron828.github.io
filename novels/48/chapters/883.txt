Chapter 884 - Cheng Xiaochen

After Elder Mu left the place, Su Yang turned to look at the disciples she‚Äôd left behind to look after him so he wouldn‚Äôt run away and spoke, "Do you ladies want a chair?"

"No, thank you." They quickly refused his offer.

Su Yang shrugged and proceeded to sit back down and close his eyes, completely ignoring the disciples.

A few minutes later, one of them suddenly asked, "Does the Yin Qi also contain Celestial Qi?"

While the Glacial Fairy Manor only accepted female disciples and had no need for Yin Qi, she was still curious about its quality.

"No, it doesn‚Äôt contain any Celestial Qi. However, it was taken from a maiden who‚Äôs an Ancient Sovereign, and she‚Äôs even a Ghost Cat." Su Yang said, deliberately not saying ‚ÄôPhantom Cat‚Äô even though it would surely attract more attention.

"W-What?! Yin Qi from a Ghost Cat who still has her Pure Yin Essence intact?! And she‚Äôs even an Ancient Sovereign?!"

The ladies there expressed even more shock than before about the Yang Qi containing Celestial Qi.

Ghost Cats are incredibly rare magical beasts that roam the Four Divine Heavens, and their incredible speed and undetectable aura make it near impossible to see them, much less catch them and extract their Yin Qi.

In terms of value, Xiao Rong‚Äôs Yin Qi is definitely more valuable than even Su Yang‚Äôs Yang Qi at this moment! And by a large margin at that!

Suddenly, someone in the distance that had overheard Su Yang‚Äôs words approached the store and said, "Can you prove that it belongs to a Ghost Cat? The Yin Qi you‚Äôre selling."

Su Yang turned to look at this middle-aged man who didn‚Äôt look like a dual cultivator.

He then smiled and said, "Because of its rarity, only those who have experienced Ghost Cat Yin Qi before would be able to tell the difference."

"Unfortunately, this means I have no real methods to prove that it belongs to a Ghost Cat, so you‚Äôll have to take my word for it."

"..."

The middle-aged man didn‚Äôt immediately curse Su Yang because what he said was right and logical. Unless someone has experienced Ghost Cat Yin Qi before, they wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell whether it‚Äôs real or not.

If someone inexperienced were to sample Xiao Rong‚Äôs Yin Qi right now, they‚Äôd only be able to tell that it‚Äôs extremely high-quality, but that would be the extent of their evaluation.

After a moment of silence, the middle-aged man spoke again, "How much do you want for one of these bottles?"

"100 high-quality spirit stones each," Su Yang responded in a calm voice.

"O-One hundred?!" The Glacial Fairy Manor disciples were shocked after hearing the price that was 100 times more expensive than the Yang Qi.

The middle-aged man frowned and said, "If you could prove that they indeed belong to a Ghost Cat, I‚Äôd be more than willing to buy it, but alas, you have no proof..."

The middle-aged man then turned around and walked away.

Su Yang didn‚Äôt say anything and allowed the middle-aged man to leave without trying to persuade him.

After all, he never really expected Xiao Rong‚Äôs Yin Qi to sell so easily. Furthermore, he already had enough spirit stones to use the teleport, and he was just keeping the store open just in case someone actually wants to buy Xiao Rong‚Äôs Yin Qi.

In the world of dual cultivation, mens‚Äô Yang Qi is sold more than females‚Äô Yin Qi because most men prefer to obtain their Yin Qi in the act whilst many female dual cultivators in the Divine Heavens are picky with their partner, not to mention the ones that want to cultivate like dual cultivators without sacrificing their body, so they buy Yang Qi to improve their cultivation instead.

In other words, male dual cultivators don‚Äôt care if they have to ‚Äôsacrifice‚Äô their body for dual cultivation since they enjoy sticking their sword inside women and consider it as an honor, so they usually don‚Äôt buy Yin Qi. Some even consider buying Yin Qi a disgrace since that usually meant they were unable to find any partners and had to resort to buying Yin Qi.

Meanwhile, for the female dual cultivators, if they can dual cultivate without sacrificing or dirtying their body, they‚Äôd do so in a heartbeat, and only females that truly enjoy having s.e.x would become real dual cultivators.

Time passed quickly, and in the blink of an eye, two days have passed since Su Yang opened up his shop.

Near the end of the second day, Elder Mu returned to his shop with a blissful look on her face, and she‚Äôd even brought a new face with her.

"Is this where you bought the Yang Qi?" This newcomer asked Elder Mu.

"That is correct, Sect Master." Elder Mu responded in a respectful manner.

Su Yang raised his eyebrows when he saw this beautiful woman that could easily rival even the top beauties in the previous world, as he recognized her face.

"So you‚Äôre still the Sect Master, huh?" Su Yang mumbled in a low and nostalgic voice.

"Excuse me?" The woman turned to look at Su Yang with a puzzled look on her face.

"I mean‚Äî you must be the Sect Master of the Glacial Fairy Manor, Cheng Xiaochen, right?"

"That‚Äôs right," she nodded, completely unaware of who she was looking at.

"You‚Äôre the one who sold these Yang Qi, right?" Cheng Xiaochen showed him one of the bottles Elder Mu had purchased from his store. DiisCoover ùíñpdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)coùíé

"Indeed," he said.

"I have tested the Yang Qi, and they all indeed contain a hint of Celestial Qi. I know you have already sold out, but do you think I can pre-order more? We‚Äôll even pay double the price for each bottle." Cheng Xiaochen proposed.

"Thank you for the offer. Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt know when I will receive more stock from that person, so I will have to decline your offer. I‚Äôm sorry, even though you came all the way here." Su Yang said to her.

"I see... Well, it was worth a try. Anyways, if you somehow get your hands on more of them, come to my Glacial Fairy Manor. We‚Äôll not only buy your entire stock but we‚Äôll even slip in some bonus service for you." Cheng Xiaochen said to him.
