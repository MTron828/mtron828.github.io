A week has passed since Mu Yuechan entered the Sacred Lands.

"So that’s the Lonely Fairies’ Refined Palace, huh? It looks quite simple, completely different from my imaginations." Me Yuechan mumbled to herself after seeing the sect that looked like an ordinary sect.

However, the powerful formation protecting the sect and the spiritual energy gathering in this area was anything but ordinary or simple.

After taking a moment to admire the place, Mu Yuechan approached the sect.

However, once she got close enough to the sect, the formation suddenly activated, and a massive amount of spiritual energy in the form of swords appeared around the sect before pointing its blade at Me Yuechan and shooting at her.

Mu Yuechan raised her eyebrows when she saw this, yet she didn’t panic.

"I should’ve asked that fatty for more information about Su Yang..." she sighed in a regretful voice before sweeping her arm in the direction of the incoming swords.

Whoosh!

A powerful wave of spiritual energy flew at the swords, destroying them with ease.

After destroying the swords, even more swords appeared around the sect, and they have also gotten stronger as well.

Mu Yuechan waved her sleeves again, destroying the swords.

She then approached the sect while she continued to defend herself from the formation.

After destroying over ten thousand swords, the formation suddenly stopped working.

A moment later, a dozen figures emerged from within the sect and surrounded Mu Yuechan.

"Who are you? Can’t you see that you’re not welcomed?" One of them asked her with a frown.

Mu Yuechan smiled and said, "I am Mu Yuechan, an information broker at the Tower of Intelligence."

"Mu Yuechan?"

A few of them have heard her name before, but not everyone was aware of her identity.

"What is your purpose at the Lonely Fairies’ Refined Palace? You, an information broker, should be well aware that our doors are closed for visitors."

"I am here to send a message to your Sect Master, Luo Ziyi. Tell her to come see me."

"The Sect Master? If you have a message, we’ll tell her."

Mu Yuechan shook her head and said, "Unfortunately, I was only told to pass the message directly to Luo Ziyi."

"Then I guess you’ll have to keep that message to yourself," said one of them.

Mu Yuechan sighed out loud and said, "Let’s not make things complicated. Bring me Luo Ziyi and I will leave peacefully."

"And what are you going to do if we don’t?"

The twelve beauties suddenly took an aggressive stance.

Depending on what comes out of Mu Yuechan’s mouth next, they may or may not attack her.

Mu Yuechan smiled after seeing this, and she spoke in a calm voice, "I may not be as powerful as your Sect Master, but I am more than enough to deal with all of you here."

A powerful pressure suddenly appeared in the place as Mu Yuechan released some of her aura, causing the twelve beauties to kneel on the floor.

"Just stay there and you won’t get hurt. I don’t want to cause a scene in the Su Family’s territory, but I have a job to do." Mu Yuechan said to them as she began stepping towards the gates of the sect.

However, before she could walk too far, another presence appeared in the area, canceling out Mu Yuechan’s aura.

"Mu Yuechan, what is the meaning of this? Why are you causing troubles for our disciples?"

A beautiful woman with breathtaking features suddenly descended from the skies and landed between Mu Yuechan and the disciples.

She then smiled and said, "It’s been a while, Wang Yunxuan. Your disciples weren’t being very cooperative despite me asking nicely, so I messed with them a little."

Wang Yunxuan frowned and said, "Why are you here, Mu Yuechan? I cannot imagine that you’d come all the way here just to mess with our disciples."

"I have some business with Luo Ziyi. Bring me to her."

"Sister Ziyi? Why do you need to speak with her?"

"I’m sorry, but I cannot tell you even if you’re Su Yang’s woman, since I was told to speak with Luo Ziyi."

Wang Yunxuan frowned when she heard the name ’Su Yang’.

"Did you really have to mention his name?"

"What? You’re still not over his death? I understand your feelings but get over it. It’s been over 2,000 years."

"That’s rich coming from you, Mu Yuechan. If you were over him, you wouldn’t be collecting his information even after his death. Furthermore, I refuse to believe that Su Yang’s dead. After all, I still have his Family Seal on my body. It may be deactivated, but if he’s really dead, it should have disappeared the day he died!"

Mu Yuechan shook her head, "Whatever helps you sleep at night."

"Anyways, I won’t leave this place until I speak with Luo Ziyi."

Wang Yunxuan released a stressful sigh. Knowing Mu Yuechan’s stubborn character, she knew that it was impossible to convince her to leave, and because of their relationship, she didn’t want to force Mu Yuechan to leave either.

Although Mu Yuechan did not belong to the Su Family, she contributed a lot to the Su Family when Su Yang was still alive, and she even helped them on a few occasions after his death.

After pondering for a moment, Wang Yunxuan turned to look at the disciples and said to them, "Thank you for your hard work. You may return to your positions. I will take care of things from here."

The ladies bowed to her in a respectful manner before leaving the scene.

Once they left, Wang Yunxuan turned to look at Mu Yuechan and said, "Come with me. I’ll take you to see Luo Ziyi. However, if she decides to beat you for bothering her, I won’t save you."

Mu Yuechan smiled upon hearing such words, "Thank you, Wang Yunxuan."

Wang Yunxuan brought Mu Yuechan into the sect shortly after.
