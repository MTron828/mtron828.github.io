Chapter 770 Negotiations

"You’re going to kick me out without asking for my identity and purpose for coming here? You’re quite the impatient man," Su Yang shook his head and turned to look at the beautiful woman beside him and continued to speak, "Is he like that in the bedroom, too?"

"YOU LITTLE BASTARD! WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?!" The middle-aged man immediately stood up and roared. "HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO ME, RUAN ZONGZE, IN SUCH A MANNER?!"

Meanwhile, the woman beside him covered her face with a shocked look on her face.

The entire place quickly turned dead silent, and even the two fighters on the stage stopped fighting to look at them with startled looks on their faces.

Su Yang remained calm and said, "My surname is Su— Su Yang, and I am here regarding the Dew of Life."

"Dew of Life? HAHAHAHAHA!" Ruan Zongze burst out laughing after hearing Su Yang’s words, even ignoring his name that sounded awfully familiar for some reason.

"So you turned out to be another idiot trying to obtain the Dew of Life from us, huh? Well, good luck with that! Because you’ll never obtain the Dew of Life now! Not that you would’ve had the chance even if you didn’t piss me the fuck off just now!"

"Are you sure? Perhaps we can negotiate. I might have a few things that might be of your interest." Su Yang remained calm and continued to speak as though there was still a chance for him.

"Negotiate? Which part of ’you’ll never get it’ don’t you understand?" Ruan Zongze coldly snorted, and he continued, "Somebody get this idiot out of my face before I lose my damn mind!"

A few people in the room immediately stood up and approached Su Yang after hearing Ruan Zongze’s words, but Su Yang did not budge even an inch and spoke, "Are you sure about that? You might lose out on the opportunity to obtain 5 Immortal-grade cultivation techniques."

"What did you just say? 5 Immortal-grade techniques?" Ruan Zongze raised his eyebrows in a surprised manner when he heard Su Yang’s words, but he laughed again a moment later.

"Ahaha! As if you’d have 5 Immortal-grade techniques! Not even the Lian Family would have so many!"

"Oh? If you don’t believe me, I can offer something else— like eternal beauty and youth for that beautiful woman over there." Su Yang suddenly turned his attention to the beautiful woman sitting beside Ruan Zongze.

"What?" Ruan Zongze’s eyes widened with surprise by Su Yang’s unexpected offer.

"I have a pill recipe that can grant any woman eternal youth and beauty without any side-effects, and they will work on even mortals who have not cultivated before. What do you think, Madam?" Su Yang did not even bother to look at Yuan Zongze and asked the woman directly.

The woman narrowed her eyes before asking, "Why are you asking me? Does it look like I have the ability to give you the Dew of Life? You’re talking to the wrong person."

"I don’t know if you have the ability or not, but I do know that you definitely have more authority than this loudmouth here just from your aura alone," Su Yang said with a smile on his face.

"Oh?" The woman raised her eyebrows in a surprised manner. "I’m impressed. And you are right, I do have more authority than my husband here because I wasn’t the one who married into his family— it’s the other way around. I am the Matriarch of the Ruan Family— Ruan Xiao Qing."

"You said your name is Su Yang, right? Are you related to Immortal Fairy Su Yue by any chance?" Ruan Xiao Qing suddenly asked him. "Judging by your aura alone, I can tell that you also have an extraordinary background."

"What?! Immortal Fairy Su Yue?! How can this rude prick be related to someone as elegant as her?!" Ruan Rongze exclaimed in a shocked voice, as did the other families in the room.

However, Su Yang did not respond to Ruan Xiao Qing’s question and merely silently smiled at her.

"I see..." Ruan Xiao Qing narrowed her eyes at Su Yang.

"Since you are related to Immortal Fairy Su Yue, I cannot just send you away. You wanted to negotiate, right? I can do that. As for your offer, although this pill of yours is a very tempting offer for me, I cannot justify trading the Dew of Life for a mere pill. After all, the Dew of Life is my Ruan Family’s most valuable treasure that has been with us for over a thousand years."

"What if I add in 5 Immortal-grade cultivation techniques into that offer?" Su Yang then asked.

"Five Immortal-grade cultivation techniques... Do you really have that many of them?" Ruan Xiao Qing asked him with a doubtful gaze.

"I have more than 5, and I’ll even let you pick which techniques you want."

"Hmm..." Ruan Xiao Qing immediately turned silent to ponder, as 5 Immortal-grade cultivation techniques was an offer that cannot be ignored regardless of their status.

"I don’t think we should trust him, my dear... Even if he’s related to Immortal Fairy Su Yue, we still don’t know his background, and we don’t know if what he is saying is true or not. Who knows, maybe even the Immortal-grade techniques are fake."

Ruan Xiao Qing turned to look at Ruan Zongze and spoke in a low voice, "Do you really not recognize his name, Su Yang? That’s Immortal Fairy Su Yue’s husband!"

"What?!" Ruan Zongze exclaimed, and he immediately became silent.

Sometime later, Ruan Xiao Qing looked at Su Yang again and said, "If you don’t mind, can we look at these Immortal-grade cultivation techniques first before we decide?"

"Sure." Su Yang nodded, and he continued, "If the pill and the Immortal-grade cultivation techniques aren’t enough, I can offer you one more thing."

"Oh? What might that be?" Ruan Xiao Qing asked him with her interest piqued. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Su Yang smiled, and he spoke in a slow but clear voice, "Satisfaction."
