Chapter 631 Offering Her Service as a Woman

"Now that Xing’er cannot enter the Celestial Pond, we have one open space." Lord Xie said

He then turned to look at Liu Lanzhi and continued to speak, "Since that’s the case, would you like to cultivate in the Celestial Pond on her behalf, Sect Master Liu?"

"M-Me...?" Liu Lanzhi unconsciously pointed at herself with a dumbfounded expression on her face, clearly in disbelief.

Lord Xie nodded and said, "Well, you are the only one here that can enter, and it’ll be too bothersome to find someone else at this point." ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

"T-Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity, Senior Xie!" Liu Lanzhi bowed to him afterward.

"Don’t even mention it," he said with a smile on his face.

Sometime later, Xie Wang said, "I’m going to prepare for our journey to the Holy Central Continent."

"Me, too. I have a lot of work to do if I want to leave the Eastern Continent for a few days." Lord Xie said.

"I will let the servants arrange your rooms."

Su Yang nodded, and he said, "You can just arrange for three rooms, one for Disciple Ji and one for Yan Yan. I will stay in the same room with Liu Lanzhi and Disciple Chen, as they also have to prepare for the Celestial Pond."

"Huh? Why would they need any preparations for... Oh..." Lord Xie realized the meaning behind Su Yang’s words midway through his sentence, making an awkward face afterward.

"Okay, three rooms then."

However, Disciple Ji suddenly said, "Your Majesty, just two rooms is fine! I will also sleep in the same room as the Sect Masters!"

"..." Lord Xie was speechless.

"Are you sure, Disciple Ji? The only reason we are staying in the same room is because we are dual cultivators, and you belong to the other division..." Liu Lanzhi said to her.

Disciple Ji nodded and said, "I am well aware of the implications, Sect Master Liu. Even though I am only an ordinary Cultivator, I would still like to offer my services to Sect Master Su as a woman who is attracted to him."

"..."

Lord Xie and Xie Xingfang could feel their jaws dropping after hearing the disciple’s words, and even Liu Lanzhi couldn’t help but admire her courage.

"If you say it like that, I can’t say no," Su Yang said to her with a calm smile on his face.

"Thank you, Sect Master..."

"What about me?" Yan Yan suddenly spoke up. "I also want to sleep in the same room as Master."

However, Su Yang quickly said, "You... You are still too young, Yan Yan."

"Why does my age matter?" Yan Yan tilted her head in a puzzled manner.

"If you don’t understand why we are sleeping together, then you are definitely too young to participate," Liu Lanzhi said to her.

"..."

Yan Yan was truly speechless. Aren’t they just sleeping together? Why does it matter whether she’s an adult or not?

"Um... If you don’t want to sleep alone, you can sleep with me." Xie Xingfang suddenly suggested to her.

Yan Yan looked at Xie Xingfang with a nonchalant expression before shaking her head, "No, I want to sleep with Master."

"..."

Xie Xingfang felt as though her pride had just taken a hit when Yan Yan refused her invitation, especially since this is her first time inviting anyone to sleep with her in her own room. Even though Yan Yan is only a little girl, it still felt extremely awkward.

"I-I see..." Xie Xingfang could only respond with a stiff smile on her face.

"How about this, Yan Yan." Su Yang suddenly said to her, "You will sleep alone today, but we can sleep together tomorrow."

"..."

After a moment of pondering, Yan Yan nodded her head. Although she didn’t like feeling left out, she also didn’t want to become a disobedient disciple, so she could only endure it for today.

"Thank you, Yan Yan." Su Yang said to her.

Sometime later, Xie Xingfang said to Yan Yan, "Come with me. I’ll show you to your room."

Once Xie Xingfang and Yan Yan left the room, a beautiful young female servant entered the room to lead Su Yang and the other girls to another room— one that had the largest and sturdiest bed in the entire building.

’I can’t believe that I am actually going to cultivate in the Xie Family’s household...’ Liu Lanzhi could barely fathom the insane situation they were in.

As for the disciples, they were simply too excited about cultivating with Su Yang to think of anything else.

"If the esteemed guests need anything, this lowly one will be waiting outside." The servant said to them with her head lowered.

However, just as the servant turned around, Su Yang’s voice resounded, "Do you want to join us?"

"...Excuse me?"

The servant turned around with a dumbfounded expression on her face, as did Liu Lanzhi and the other disciples.

"I can see your body fidgeting even now. If you want to join us, I don’t mind. The more the merrier, after all." Su Yang said with a smile.

"B-But I cannot..."

"What’s the matter? I thought you said to let you know if we need anything."

"While that’s true, I don’t dare to do that sort of thing in His Majesty’s dwelling..." The servant showed him a bittersweet smile.

If Lord Xie learns of her scandalous actions when she’s supposed to be doing her job, losing her job would be the least of her worries.

"You are still doing your job as a servant by ’serving’ me. If Lord Xie or anyone has an issue with that, I’ll give them a piece of my mind, so you don’t need to worry about any punishment. I can promise you that."

"Really...? You are going to do that for me, a mere servant you’ve never met before?" She asked him.

Su Yang nodded and spoke with a charming smile on his face, "Your status is not relevant. I only see a beautiful woman who’s surrounded by a lonely feeling, so I want to help you relieve that stress."

Hearing his words, the female servant blushed. One of the requirements for working as a servant for the Xie Family is that they must live in the same building to make it more convenient and efficient for their job. And while working for the Xie Family may be incredibly rewarding and even make one feel distinguished, it does make them feel lonely most of the time, as the servants would rarely have any free time for themselves, and even when they do get some free time, they would not have the energy to do anything else besides sleep.

After a moment of silence, the female servant finally nodded her head in a bashful manner.

"Come over here," Su Yang said to her.

The female servant then locked the door behind her before approaching the bed.

"This is my first time, Young Master..." The female servant trembled slightly when Su Yang loosened her robes.

"I will take the lead. Just follow the flow of my movements and enjoy the pleasure."

The female servant nodded before Su Yang laid her on the large bed.

A few moments later, the female servant began moaning with pleasure while the other girls on the bed watched with a passionate gaze.
