Chapter 780 Desolate City

"T-Thank you, Senior!" Chief Long bowed to Su Yang in a respectful manner after catching the pill.

"By the way, which way is this Desolate City?" Su Yang asked afterward.

"Towards the east from this place." Chief Long said.

Su Yang nodded and returned to the flying boat with Lian Li.

A few moments later, they flew away from the Dragon Tribe and flew towards the east.

Once Su Yang was gone, Chief Long fell on his butt again and stared at the mysterious pill in his grasp.

There was no way for him to tell whether the pill is poisoned or not because he is not an alchemist, nor are there any alchemy masters in the Dragon Tribe. However, since Su Yang really kept his promise and returned the Black Dragon Axe, this mysterious pill might actually be exactly as he’d described it.

"Ahhh! Fuck it! I am already crippled! If this pill kills me then so be it!" Chief Long shouted before tossing the pill into his mouth and swallowing it whole.

Meanwhile, Lian Li asked Su Yang sometime after they left the Dragon Tribe, "So we now have 2 ingredients out of the required nine, and if this family has the third ingredient, we’ll be almost halfway there. I think we are quite fortunate already. Don’t you think so too, Su Yang?"

Su Yang nodded and said, "Yes, obtaining 2 ingredients out of nine is already very fortunate for us, and we still have two more continents to explore after this one."

Sometime later, Lian Li pointed at the large city a few miles in the distance and said, "Do you think that’s the Desolate City?"

"We’ll see."

A few moments later, they descended outside the city and approached the guards standing outside. However, unlike the Eastern Continent and the Holy Central Continent, there weren’t as many people entering and leaving the city.

"Is this the Desolate City?" Su Yang asked the startled guards, as they have never seen someone with skin as pale and pure as theirs, nor have they seen any women even half as beautiful as Lian Li before.

"Y-Yes, this is Desolate City!" The guard nodded in a dazed manner.

Su Yang then said, "Is there a family known for collecting rare treasures in this city? I’m here to meet them."

"A family that collects...? Oh, you mean the Ji Family?"

Su Yang nodded and suddenly retrieved a handful of spirit stones before asking them, "Can you tell me a little more about this Ji Family?"

The guards’ stared at the glistening spirit stones in Su Yang’s grasp with a gawking expression, and they immediately began telling Su Yang everything they knew about the Ji Family.

"The Ji Family is one of if not the wealthiest family in the Southern Continent, and as you already know, they have a habit of collecting extremely rare treasures from around the world. If you have something rare to sell, they will buy it for much more than others would. However, if you want something from their collection, expect to pay much more as well."

"I see... Thank you. Here’s something for your work." Su Yang handed the spirit stones to the guards before entering the city with Lian Li.

"Oh! One more thing, Senior!" One of the guards suddenly stopped them.

"Hm?"

The guard then turned to look at Lian Li before speaking in a nervous tone, "Don’t tell them I said this but... The Ji Family has a son who is extremely perverted and well-known for harassing any beautiful women he sets his eyes on. If I were you, I would go there alone."

"Is that so? Thank you for your warning, but I am not someone who would hide my own woman in fear of another man. If he dares to even look at her inappropriately, I’ll personally gouge his eyes out." Su Yang spoke with a cold smile on his face, causing the guards to shiver in fear.

Once Su Yang left the scene, the guards mumbled to each other.

"Just who was that man? To look down on the Ji Family in such a manner, he must have come from an incredibly powerful background."

"Did you see that goddess beside him though? Seeing her beauty has significantly increased my own standards! I would’ve never imagined that such a beautiful woman could exist in this world!" Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

"Are you kidding me? I don’t think I’ll be able to forget about her in this life!"

"Haaa... If I had a woman who has even 10 percent of that goddess’ beauty, I would be able to die peacefully at any moment of the day!"

"Hahaha! Have you looked in the mirror before? I’d off myself if you can get a woman that’s even one percent of that goddess’ beauty!"

"Man, fuck you!"

Meanwhile, Su Yang and Lian Li just arrived at the Ji Family’s household that took up an entire street.

"These people are definitely rich..." Lian Li mumbled after seeing the overly decorated building, feeling like she was staring at a building made of pure gold.

After standing around for a few seconds, Su Yang approached the doors, where a single guard that emitted the cultivation of peak Earth Spirit Realm stood.

"Hmmm?"

When the Earth Spirit Realm guard noticed Su Yang’s approaching figure, he immediately began pondering to figure out Su Yang’s identity.

’I have never seen this man or the woman beside him before, but... they’re definitely experts! The aura they’re emitting is stronger than every single Heavenly Spirit Realm Cultivators that I have encountered before!’ The guard thought to himself.

"Welcome to the Ji Family, esteemed guests. How may we assist you today?"

The guard bowed to them in a respectful manner.

"I’m here to do business with the Ji Family. I may have some treasure they want, and they might have something that I want. Are they home?" Su Yang asked the guard.

"Yes, they are. Please follow me to the guest room whilst I notify the Ji Family of your presence."
