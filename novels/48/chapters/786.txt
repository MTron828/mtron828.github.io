Chapter 787 - Body Refiner

Su Yang left the Ning Family’s territory after giving them the Divine-grade cultivation technique, but he did not immediately go to the Western Continent. Instead, he wandered in the Northern Continent with Lian Li and Xiao Rong, looking like they were sightseeing.

"What do you think of this place?" Su Yang asked Lian Li sometime later.

"It reminds me of the Eastern Continent, but it feels much more peaceful here for some reason," she responded with a pondering look on her face.

"That’s probably because of the atmosphere here as well as the spiritual energy," Su Yang said.

"What does spiritual energy have anything to do with this?" Lian Li tilted her head, looking puzzled.

"There are different types of spiritual energy that have various effects in this world, and the Northern Continent just happens to have this type of spiritual energy that calms people down." Su Yang said.

"What?" Lian Li looked at him with wide eyes filled with surprise. "There exists such a thing? I didn’t know that spiritual energy could cause such phenomenons! After all, the Holy Central Continent doesn’t have anything like this!"

Su Yang nodded and said, "I’m not surprised since this world is very small. Once we go to the Divine Heavens, you’ll be able to experience more of these phenomena, and some of them will straight up shock you."

"You say this world is small... but just how big is the Divine Heavens compared to this world? One can travel for a thousand years and wouldn’t see every city in this world!" Lian Li said.

Su Yang smiled and said, "Well, if I say there are cities in the Divine Heavens that are larger than even the Holy Central Continent as a whole, what would you think?"

Lian Li’s jaw dropped, and she mumbled in a dazed voice, "Cities that are bigger than the Holy Central Continent? I cannot imagine how one will be able to traverse such a vast world..."

Su Yang shook his head and said, "Although they may be incredibly rare in this world, flying treasures such as the one we’re currently using are very common in the Divine Heavens, and almost every decent Cultivator has one."

"There are also teleportation formations located in almost every city around the world, allowing even mortals to traverse between cities and across the world with ease."

"Heavens... The Divine Heavens sounds like a mythical place... I cannot wait to see it." Lian Li mumbled in a wondering voice.

Sometime later, after they’d seen most of the Northern Continent, Su Yang controlled the flying ship to fly towards the Western Continent.

"Xiao Rong, do what you did before and look for the person with the highest cultivation base," Su Yang said to her.

Xiao Rong nodded and proceeded to spread her spiritual sense throughout the Western Continent.

A couple of moments later, she said, "I found him."

Xiao Rong flew towards this individual with Su Yang following her from behind.

Sometime later, they arrived at this seemingly boundless sea, and there was a half-n.a.k.e.d old man with an incredibly refined body that would shame most young people sitting in the middle of this sea directly on the surface of the water, almost like a weightless leaf on water.

And to their surprise, this old man was at the third level Sovereign Spirit Realm.

"Hmmm..."

The old man slowly opened his eyes and turned to look at Su Yang and Lian Li right as they stopped above him, and his gaze lingered on Xiao Rong for the longest before he spoke in a calm voice—

"How can I help you, guests from another Continent?"

"Oh? So you know?" Su Yang said with a smile.

"Of course... I know every Cultivator above the Heavenly Spirit Realm in this place, but I don’t recognize the young fairies..."

Su Yang nodded and said, "I see... Anyway, I am Su Yang, and we’re from the Eastern Continent, here to see if the Western Continent has some ingredients that we’re looking for."

"Eastern Continent... What kind of treasures are you looking for?" The old man said, giving off the feeling that he was willing to help them despite being complete strangers. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

"Here."

Su Yang showed the old man his list.

"Hmmm..."

The old man looked at the treasures before mumbling, "And what do you want me to do?"

"I’d appreciate it if you can tell me if you recognize any of the names on that list and if someone has it."

"I do recognize one of the items on this list, and I also know who has it. However, what do I get out of it?" The old man looked at Su Yang with a profound look in his gaze.

Su Yang looked at the old man with a pondering look for a moment before retrieving the cursed treasure that he’d recently obtained and said, "How about excitement? Although you are trying to hide it, I can tell from your eyes that look like someone who hasn’t had a good fight in a long time."

"HAHAHAHA!"

The old man suddenly burst out laughing, and he said, "I don’t mean to be rude, but I truly didn’t expect someone at the Heavenly Spirit Realm to challenge me. I was expecting one of the two fairies to fight me instead."

"You want to fight me...?" Lian Li raised her eyebrows, and then she continued, "I may be at the Sovereign Spirit Realm but I cannot beat him who is ’only’ at the Heavenly Spirit Realm, you know?"

"What? Is that true?" The old man looked at Lian Li with wide eyes.

Su Yang then jumped from the flying boat and hovered above the water.

"You’re a Body Refiner, right? It’s been a while since I’ve done this, but..."

Su Yang then removed the top of his clothes, revealing his refined body.

The old man’s eyes widened with shock when he saw Su Yang’s body. Despite having fewer muscles than him, Su Yang’s body emitted this otherworldly aura, almost like it was a divine body of sorts.
