Somewhere in Jade Heaven, a beautiful woman sat comfortably behind a luxurious marble table piled high with paperwork.

In the midst of her work, she noticed a certain communication jade slip trembling and immediately picked it up.

"Good morning, Madam Ruby. 'Ming Ye' has arrived," the receptionist of Gleaming Waterfront Hotel dutifully informed her.

Madam Ruby, absorbed in her tasks, responded with a calm composure, "Is that so? Tell me your first impressions of him."

"Of course. I don't think I need to delve into his appearance, as those hailing from the esteemed Boundless Yin Yang Sect are invariably graced with an exceptional countenance. He has short, raven-black hair that frames his countenance, and his eyes, obsidian in hue, possess a gaze of such intensity that it seems to pierce through one's very soul," the receptionist continued with a touch of fascination. "Yet, what's truly impressive about him is the enigmatic aura that envelops him, defying any attempts at description. He's unlike the others I've encountered‚Äî that's what my instincts tell me."

Madam Ruby privately contemplated the receptionist's glowing appraisal and couldn't help but muse, 'This is the first time he's praised someone this highly.'

With her curiosity piqued, her fingers paused momentarily over her work, as she awaited the receptionist's further insights into this mysterious guest.

"So, do you think he'll be able to satisfy my needs?"

"I cannot say for sure, but he definitely seemed very calm and confident, almost as though he's a real master. Even if he cannot satisfy your desires, I truly believe that it will be the best attempt yet."

"Thank you for your input," Madam Ruby acknowledged with a gracious nod. "I shall meet with 'Ming Ye' once I've concluded my current tasks. Anticipate that it may take several days, perhaps even a week at most."

With a sense of purpose, Madam Ruby returned to her work, her mind already occupied by thoughts of the intriguing visitor who had captured her attention.

Meanwhile, the receptionist made his way to Su Yang's room, gently knocking on the door to deliver the news that Madam Ruby's arrival might be delayed by up to a week.

Su Yang, his demeanor marked by a tranquil composure, graciously acknowledged the information. "Thank you for letting me know. I will remain here until her arrival," he replied calmly before returning to his cultivation.

Despite Madam Ruby's delay, Su Yang didn't mind it one bit. After all, the Boundless Yin Yang Sect had given him a whole month for each mission for a reason‚Äîthey knew this kind of thing happened all the time.

Time slipped by unnoticed, and before Su Yang knew it, two weeks had flown by without a trace of Madam Ruby. Still, Su Yang did not bother to inquire about Madam Ruby's delay and continued to cultivate inside his room.

If a client doesn't show up within a month, he would simply make his way to the next client. And if he had time to spare afterward, he would return and continue waiting until he had to return to the sect.

Exactly at the start of the third week, Su Yang opened his eyes when someone knocked on his door.

"Is Ming Ye in here?" A soothing voice asked from outside.

Su Yang stood up and walked to the door, opening it to greet the woman on the other side.

"Good morning, I am Ming Ye. Please, come inside." Su Yang welcomed her into the room even before confirming her identity.

The woman who stood before Su Yang was a statuesque beauty, her frame exuding an alluring grace. Her long, ebony waves cascaded down to caress her ample curves and round buttocks, while her eyes sparkled like polished onyx. Her lips, a tantalizing temptation, beckoned with their beguiling allure.

As she entered the room, Su Yang closed the door behind her. The woman spoke with an apologetic tone, "I apologize for the delay. An unexpected matter arose, and I had to attend to it first."

Su Yang responded with a charming smile, shaking his head playfully. "I wouldn't mind waiting a hundred years for someone as beautiful as you, Madam Ruby."

Madam Ruby, though flattered by his words, remained composed, her focus now on inspecting Su Yang closely. She thought to herself, 'He's just as described‚Äîhandsome, exuding that inexplicable aura, and his gaze is undeniably powerful. My heart is already racing.' Her emotions remained hidden behind a calm exterior as she continued to assess the intriguing man before her.

"What's your name?"

"Xiao Yang."

"Then, Xiao Yang, before we begin, even though you should've already seen it from my request, I will repeat the rules just in case. One, you are only allowed to use your hands. This means there will be no sexual intercourse. Two, we will begin with my clothes on. If I deem your skills to be insufficient, we will stop there and then. Last but not least, there will be no kissing."

"Of course." Su Yang calmly nodded, acknowledging her rules.

"Whenever you are ready," she said a moment later as she sat on the large bed.

"Then, if you would, please lie on the bed with your back facing the ceiling."

"My back?" Madam Ruby was a little puzzled by his request. After all, what could he possibly do to please her while she was lying on her stomach?

With Madam Ruby comfortably lying on the bed, Su Yang positioned himself beside her and began a simple arm stretch, his movements fluid and deliberate.

"I will begin now." Su Yang warned her as he approached her back with his fingers.

Not expecting anything, Madam Ruby remained nonchalant.

"Ah!?"

Madam Ruby, in a moment of unforeseen revelation, involuntarily surrendered a startled moan as an unanticipated wave of sensation cascaded through her being, unveiling realms of feeling previously uncharted in her existence.DiiSc√¥ver ùíèùíÜw storiùíÜs on no/ùíó/e()/lbin(.)com

"Y-You! What did you just do?!" she exclaimed, swiftly swiveling her head to apprehend the source of this unexpected enchantment, only to discover, to her profound astonishment, that Su Yang was merely giving her a normal massage‚Äî or so it seemed.

"Just a massage," Su Yang replied with a calm smile on his face.
