Chapter 808 - Meeting the Lu Family

After cleaning up and organizing their clothes, Su Yang left the room with the others and followed Ji Hong outside, where three large carriages waited.

"It’ll take us about four days to arrive at the Lu Family. I’d use quicker transportation methods, but I have some treasures I must deliver to the Lu Family, so I must use these carriages. I apologize for any inconvenience," Ji Hong said to them.

Su Yang nodded and said, "It’s only a couple of days."

A few moments later, Su Yang entered one of the three carriages in the middle with Lian Li and Xiao Rong while Ji Hong went to speak with the dozen guards that’ll be coming with them before entering the carriage at the end.

"Start the journey!" Ji Hong shouted from inside the carriage, and they began moving a few moments later.

Once they were on the road, inside Su Yang’s carriage, Lian Li laid her head on Su Yang’s shoulders and enjoyed a slow and peaceful journey like a recently married couple on a honeymoon.

However, after moving for two days without stopping, the carriages suddenly came to a halt, and the guards could be heard shouting in alert, "Bandits! We are surrounded by bandits! Defend the carriages and kill all who dares to approach!"

The guards at the Earth Spirit Realm began fighting the bandits, and Ji Hong suddenly knocked on Su Yang’s carriage.

"Senior, we’re currently under attack. Please wait inside until everything is peaceful—"

"Haaa..."

A sigh resounded in the carriage, and before Ji Hong could even finish his sentence, a ripple filled with Spirit Qi suddenly appeared from Su Yang’s carriage, sweeping through the entire area.

"Ahhhh!"

Instantly, painful shrieks resounded as the bandits that’d touched the ripple was instantly sliced in halves, shocking the guards that were not harmed despite touching the ripples. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

A few seconds later, the entire place turned dead silent, as every single bandit was laying on the ground without a complete corpse.

"You may continue the journey now," Su Yang’s calm voice resounded from inside the carriage a moment later.

"T-T-Thank you, Senior..." Ji Hong said to the carriage in a nervous voice, as he’d never witnessed anything like this before, feeling awe and fear at the same time.

After the guards returned to their positions, the carriages began moving again.

"Heavens... What just happened? Why did the ripple not affect us?"

"I have never seen such profound strength before! Whoever is in the carriage must be a peak expert in this world!"

"But he looked so young— even younger than my son!"

"Is your son a peak cultivator as well? You know that one’s appearance can be extremely deceiving in the cultivation world, especially those at the top!"

A few hours of smooth traveling later, the carriages came to another halt, and the guards could be heard shouting about bandits again.

"Bandits! Bandits! Bandits!"

However, before the guards could even pull their swords from its scabbard, Su Yang activated his Sword Qi and killed all of the bandits before they could even approach the carriages, dumbfounding the guards.

"T-Thank you, Senior!"

They all bowed to the cart afterward.

"Keep the carriage moving. I’ll deal with the bandits.

"Yessir!"

The carriages continued moving a few moments later.

And for the rest of their journey, the guards lowered their alertness and treated the journey as though it was a vacation of sorts.

Four days later, the carriages stopped in front of a large city. During this time, Su Yang had killed over a thousand bandits with his Sword Qi and without stepping out of the carriage, and the bandits all died without understanding how they’d died!

"Master Ji, Seniors, we have arrived at the Lu Family’s city."

"Continue forward!" Ji Hong spoke from the carriage.

"Yes, Master Ji!"

A few moments later, the guards pulled up to the entrance to the city and said to the guards there, "We are from the Ji Family, and Master Ji is here with a delivery for the Lu Family."

"The Ji Family? We have been waiting for your arrival. Can I see your proof of identification?"

The Ji Family then showed their family medallion alongside the Lu Family’s letter that had a seal in it.

Once the guards at the gates confirmed its authenticity, they nodded, "Thank you. Please, enter the city."

A few moments later, they entered the city with the carriages and began making their way towards the Lu Family that was located in the heart of this large city.

"We’ll arrive at the Lu Family in about an hour, Seniors."

The guards said to Su Yang from the outside.

"Thank you."

An hour later, the carriages stopped once again, and the guards said, "We’re at the Lu Family, Master Ji, Seniors."

Hearing this, everyone left their carriages and gathered in front of a massive household that spawned throughout multiple streets.

"Please follow me, Seniors."

Ji Hong said to them before approaching the gates to the household.

"Welcome to the Lu Family, Senior Ji. The Masters will be ready to meet you in a few minutes," said the guards by the gates after seeing Ji Hong’s face.

While the Ji Family’s guards stayed behind to guard the carriages and the treasures, the Lu Family’s guards led Su Yang and the others into the house.

Once they were inside, the guards led them to the guest room where they proceeded to wait until the Lu Family was ready to meet them.

About ten minutes later, the guards returned and led them to another room— a long and spacious room that looked more like a hallway with two figures sitting at the end of the room, both emitting an impressive aura at the peak Heavenly Spirit Realm.

"Welcome to my Lu Family, Patriarch Ji, and esteemed guests from the Eastern Continent. Thank you for coming all the way here. I am Lu Dahan, head of the Lu Family, and this is my wonderful wife, Lu Jin," said the middle-aged man with a friendly yet somewhat stiff smile on his face.
