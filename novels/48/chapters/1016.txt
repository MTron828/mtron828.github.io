Chapter 1017: Treasure Exchange Gallery

After arriving at the Treasure Exchange Gallery, Su Yang didn’t immediately enter the building. Instead, he walked around the area, where disciples could be seen selling their own things.

It was like a bazaar, but a private one that’s exclusive to disciples within the sect and.

As for what the disciples were selling, they had a variety of items, such as spiritual treasures, talismans, medicine with aphrodisiacs effects that boosts one’s vitality without making them go crazy, funny-looking objects for pleasuring in the bedroom, and even other disciples’ Yin and Yang Qi.

"Euphoric Oil! Come get your Euphoric Oil here! Only 100 low-grade spirit stones each!" A beautiful young lady shouted behind her stall that was stocked with Euphoric Oil.

"I’m selling this priceless treasure that had been used by Fairy Mia of the Southern Gates! 5 medium grade spirit stones!" A handsome man said with a piece of undergarment carefully positioned inside a display case, allowing everyone to take a good look at all of its details. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Meanwhile, right beside him, there was a beautiful woman that appeared to be selling objects that had the shape of a man’s dragon, and they were mostly made out of jade.

"Come take a look at these pleasure toys! They were crafted by a famous craftswoman that had memorized the legendary God of Pleasure’s penis after cultivating with him! If you wish to experience what it feels like to have the God of Pleasure inside your body, you will need one of these! I only have very little supply, first come first serve!"

Su Yang couldn’t help but stop and take a look at these pleasure toys after hearing what the disciple had said.

He wasn’t surprised that someone had crafted replicas of his dragon since there are many of those floating around in all four Divine Heavens. However, he was interested in the replicas’ quality and accuracy.

Of course, the stall was already crowded with female disciples.

"Huh?" Su Yang noticed a certain young lady within the crowd and couldn’t help but smile.

It was Lin Xinyi, and she was completely focused on the jade toys, so she didn’t notice him even though he was right behind her.

Once he was close enough, Su Yang inspected the pleasure toys with his spiritual sense so that he could see every part of it without needing to hold it in his hands.

’The craftsmanship isn’t bad, but it’s not accurate...’ Su Yang thought to himself.

The creator of these replicas had managed to get about 60 percent of its shape and size right, suggesting that she might have actually cultivated with Su Yang before.

However, there is also the chance that this creator has studied someone else’s replica of Su Yang’s dragon.

"W-What are you doing here?"

Lin Xinyi eventually noticed Su Yang standing behind her.

"Huh? I was looking at these jade toys." He said with a smile.

"Y-You?" Lin Xinyi frowned at his words.

After all, these jade toys were created to please women. If a man wanted one these, one can only imagine what they would do with it.

Seeing Lin Xinyi’s perplexed expression, Su Yang chuckled and said, "Please don’t misunderstand. I like women, and I never said that I wanted one. I was only interested because I have never seen someone selling these kinds of things before."

"s-Sorry... I didn’t mean to..." Lin Xinyi immediately began blushing.

"Are you also interested? In these... uh... toys? I noticed you staring at them with great focus."

"O-Only slightly!" Lin Xinyi quickly responded.

"I have also never seen these toys before, so I became interested..."

Su Yang smiled, "There’s no need to be ashamed. Many cultivators use these toys, even immortals, believe it or not. There are also specially made toys used for extracting a woman’s Yin Qi."

"Look over there at that stall. They’re selling some." Su Yang pointed to the stall a few steps down.

Lin Xinyi silently stared at the toys with a pondering face. Clearly, she was deciding whether to buy one or not.

"If you’re thinking about getting one because they are a replica of the God of Pleasure’s manhood, then don’t."

"Why not?" She asked him.

"Because they do not accurately recreate the God of Pleasure’s manhood. They’re off- about 40 percent off."

"And how do you know that?" Lin Xinyi looked at him with raised eyebrows.

"Believe it or not, I have seen the real thing with my own eyes."

"Y-You have seen the God of Pleasure’s manhood?

There’s no way that I’d believe that!" She frowned.

"Oh, I don’t mean his actual manhood. I am talking about a perfect replica of his manhood. One of my friends has a hobby in collecting these kinds of toys. But if you still don’t believe me, you can find perfect replicas inside the Treasure Exchange Gallery."

"Really? I didn’t know that. If that’s the case, then I will take a look at these perfect replicas first."

"Then do you want to go together? I also have some business there." Su Yang said.

"I don’t mind." She nodded.

Su Yang and Lin Xinyi made their way to the Treasure Exchange Gallery shortly after.

"Let’s go look at your toys first. My stuff can wait." Su Yang said to her.

"Can you not call them toys? I want one not because I intend on playing with it. I just want one for collection purposes, and even if I want to use it, I have to wait until I lose my Pure Yin Essence." Lin Xinyi said.

"Of course. And if you need help losing your Pure Yin Essence, I will always be available to help." Su Yang said with a smile.

"..."

Lin Xinyi became speechless after hearing his words.

"Follow me. These... objects are on the 3rd floor." Su Yang said before guiding her to the 3rd floor, where all sorts of pleasure toys can be found.

"As expected of the Boundless Yin Yang Sect... They have a vast collection of these sorts of things..." Lin Xinyi mumbled to herself.
