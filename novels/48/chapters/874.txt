Chapter 875 - Supreme Appearance Altering Pill

Once everyone was gathered on the deck of the flying ship, Su Yang said to them, "The treasure should appear in a few days, and once that happens, we will have only a few hours to enter it. However, before we enter the treasure, I need all of you to go inside the Spatial Device so that we won’t accidentally become separated once we enter the mirror, as anything can happen while we’re inside, and I won’t risk losing any of you here."

The ladies there nodded.

Su Yang then continued, "Once you enter the Spatial Device, you will not be able to leave until I find a safe location to open the doors. This could take days, weeks, even months, but I will try my best to find a safe location for us as soon as possible."

"There’s no need to rush things, Su Yang. Your safety is the most important to us." Wu Jingjing said to him.

Su Yang smiled and said, "Don’t worry, I already have a place in mind, but since I don’t know where we’ll end up in the Divine Heavens— if we’ll even go to the Divine Heavens, I cannot really say for sure."

"Will we be able to see you in the meantime?" Zhang Xiu Ying asked him. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Su Yang shook his head and said, "Unfortunately, we will not be able to meet. However, I can still speak to you all through the Spatial Device."

"That’s good enough." Sun Jingjing said.

"Su Yang, what’s going to happen if we don’t arrive in the Divine Heavens?" Zhu Mengyi asked him.

"I will figure things out if we do reach that point. However, I am pretty confident that we’ll reach the Divine Heavens," he said.

"Any more questions?" Su Yang then asked.

"Do I also have to be inside the Spatial Device?" A voice suddenly asked.

Su Yang turned to look at the peerless beauty with silver hair— Qiuyue.

"That would be for the best." He nodded.

And he continued, "Did you already forget? You’re still hunted by the Sacred Moon Temple. It would be unwise to have you walking around the Divine Heavens even if we disguise you since the Moon Clan has unique methods of finding their own bloodline."

"I guess so..." Qiuyue sighed.

Then she asked, "What about you? I’m sure there’ll be people who will recognize you even though you look younger."

Su Yang chuckled and said, "Of course, I will be disguising myself."

"Wow! What kind of pill is that? I have never seen a pitch-black pill before!" Wang Shuren was the first to speak after seeing this pill.

"This is the Supreme Appearance Altering Pill. It will not only disguise my face, but it’ll also alter the shape of my body and even the length of my bones. Although it’s not the best appearance-changing pills out there since I don’t have the resources to make them, this should be more than enough to keep myself lowkey until I find a better one."

"What? There are even better pills out there even though this one can alter your bones?" Wang Shuren was surprised to hear that.

"Of course. They’re so complicated that even I don’t want to explain it. You’ll have to see it for yourself." Su Yang said.

"Do you think you can disguise yourself now? I want to see what you’re going to look like going to the Divine Heavens." Su Yin asked him.

Su Yang chuckled and said, "I will let you all see my disguise right before you enter the Spatial Device."

"What? Why?" Su Yin tilted her head, looking confused.

"Let’s just say if I do it now, it’s going to be awkward cultivating with you for the next few days. Of course, if none of you wants to cultivate with me from now until we leave, I can consume the pill now." Su Yang said.

The ladies were speechless.

"I-I can wait to see you transform, brother." Su Yin quickly said, as it was not worth losing her time cultivating with him.

The others agreed by nodding their heads silently.

Su Yang smiled and stored the Supreme Appearance Altering Pill away shortly after.

"Then let’s not waste any more time. I won’t be able to cultivate with any of you for a while after we leave, after all." Su Yang then said to them.

The ladies that are able to cultivate with him quickly dragged him inside the flying ship and began cultivating with him one by one.

However, since they don’t have much time left, they were only allowed to cultivate with him for a couple of hours so that everyone in the family could have a turn before they have to leave.

As for those who could not cultivate with him due to obvious reasons, one of them being underaged, they spent their time cultivating by themselves.

On the third day, Su Yang finished cultivating with everyone that wanted to cultivate with him.

When he went to the deck of the ship, he noticed people gathering below the flying ship and the place where the Mirror of Darkness should appear.

"They are probably people who want to enter the Mirror of Darkness like us." Qin Liangyu said to him.

"Every 2 years, people from around the Southern Continent would come here to enter the mirror. Of course, that number has lowered throughout the years when more and more people realize that everybody that entered the mirror never returned. However, despite that, there will always be some curious people who would still risk everything and enter the mirror." Qin Liangyu explained to him when Su Yang asked her.

"I see..." Su Yang mumbled.

Sometime later, Su Yang noticed a figure approaching their location, and this figure was flying in the air.

"Hm? That figure..." Su Yang’s eyes widened slightly when he saw a familiar bulky figure approaching him.

"It’s been a while, Su Yang." Xian Ni said to him with a bright smile. "Looks like I made it here in time. It would’ve s.u.c.k.e.d if you’d already left this world before I could even show up."
