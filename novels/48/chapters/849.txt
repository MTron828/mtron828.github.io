Chapter 850 - Continental Meeting

Su Yang and Liu Lanzhi met up with Emperor Lian and Feng Xindou at the front entrance a few minutes later.

"Su Yang, can I speak with you for a moment?" Feng Xindou said to him the moment they arrived.

Su Yang nodded, following Feng Xindou to somewhere more private.

"I hope you enjoyed your stay here." Emperor Lian said to Liu Lanzhi.

"Yes, thank you very much for letting us stay here." Liu Lanzhi responded with a beaming smile on her face. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Meanwhile, after they stopped walking, Feng Xindou lowered her body and bowed to Su Yang, "Thank you for all that you’ve done for me and my family, Su Yang."

Su Yang smiled and said, "So you have finally decided to return to his side, huh?"

Feng Xindou’s eyes widened with surprise. How did he know what she was thinking?

"And you don’t have to thank me. I am simply doing what I want, and you’re Lian Li’s mother. It’s only natural for me to help you, who was suffering," said Su Yang.

"It was fun while it lasted, Su Yang. If I had met you a little bit earlier, perhaps..."

Su Yang shook his head and interrupted, "Don’t continue any further. You’ll only doubt yourself in the future."

"Let’s regroup with the others. It won’t look good on us if we arrive late to the meeting." Su Yang said, turning around and walking away.

Feng Xindou took a deep breath before returning to Emperor Lian’s side.

"Are you okay?" Emperor Lian asked Feng Xindou when she came back, noticing a hint of gloom on her face.

"I’m fine," she responded with a smile on her face.

"Let’s go meet the others now, shall we?" Emperor Lian said to them.

Sometime later, they went outside and entered the carriages that were waiting outside.

While they could’ve simply flown there, it wouldn’t be as formal as going in carriages, and having a good first impression is a must for a family of their stature.

Of course, these were no ordinary carriages. The carriages were actually mounted onto these tamed magical beasts with wings, resembling large birds, which allowed them to soar into the sky with ease.

"We’re going to ride this bird?" This was Liu Lanzhi’s first time seeing such a method of traveling, much less travel in one.

"If you think this is impressive, imagine riding on dragons and phoenixes." Su Yang chuckled.

"How can I imagine something that doesn’t even exist in this world?" She shook her head.

Once they entered the carriages, the bird flapped their massive wings and flew towards the sky.

An hour later, they arrived in a specious and empty area that used to house the Golden Lion Academy, and in the middle of this place was a single-floored building that appeared to have been recently built.

After they landed, Su Yang and the others entered the building.

However, before they could even enter the building, Su Yang could already feel the people inside the building staring in their direction.

"Welcome, Su Yang! We have been waiting for you!" Xian Ni from the Western Continent.

Even though they already have a teleportation formation on the Western Continent, he still decided to participate in the meeting so the other continents don’t get any wrong idea about them.

As for the other participants, there was Zhu Mengyi’s mother from the Four Seasons Academy and Wu Jingjing’s father from the Holy Sword Academy that represented the Holy Central Continent with the Lian Family.

In the Southern Continent, it was the Lu Family and the Ji Family, alongside a couple of individuals Su Yang wasn’t familiar with.

The Ning Family and more people Su Yang don’t recognize represented the Northern Continent.

Finally, the Xie Family and the Profound Blossom Sect represented the Eastern Continent.

Sometime later, once everybody sat around a massive table, Su Yang said, "Thank you all for participating in this. Now, let’s get straight to the point. The Western Continent and the Eastern Continent have agreed to become ’neighbors’ with each other through the teleportation formation. What is preventing the rest of you from doing the same?"

Emperor Lian was the first to speak, "Well, let me begin with the most obvious problem— the safety of our own people. While connecting continents sounds like a great idea, it’d be problematic if someone with malicious intentions were to start chaos in a foreign land. How can we prevent this from happening?"

Su Yang nodded and said, "That’s simple— by restricting the teleportation formation, allowing only those who are trustworthy to use them. Before one can use the teleportation formation, they must receive permission from the family with control over the formation. Furthermore, you can discuss with the other continent to make sure they allow this individual to enter their land."

"Any more concerns?"

"This isn’t really a concern, but what is the real purpose of the teleport formation? I can’t imagine doing something like this just so we can visit each other." One of the individuals from the Northern Continent that Su Yang didn’t recognize asked.

"That will depend on the individual. One can simply travel to another continent as a tour. You can also do business with each other. The possibilities are almost endless." Su Yang said.

"What about the price? From what I heard, it’ll take at least a million spirit stones to use the teleport formation. That’s simply too expensive for the majority of the people to take advantage of."

Su Yang shrugged and said, "The teleport formation isn’t meant for everyone just like how not everyone can afford to live luxuriously."

The people there continued to ask Su Yang questions.

A couple of hours later, after answering the majority of the questions, Su Yang said to them, "How about this? Let’s have a trial period to see whether or not you want the teleport formation in your continent. If you don’t like it, you can simply destroy it after all."

The people in the room exchanged glances with each other and began pondering.
