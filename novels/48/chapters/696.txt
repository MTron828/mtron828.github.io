Chapter 697 - A Third One

"Aaaah~!"

"Aaaa~!"

"Mmmmmh~!

Lian Li’s body glistened with sweat as she cultivated with Su Yang for hours without rest.

"Ahhhh~!"

Lian Li began twitching a few moments later, and her body released Yin Qi for the twentieth time.

"Haaa... haaa... haaa..." Lian Li collapsed onto Su Yang’s chest afterward, feeling completely drained.

"We can stop here if you can’t continue," Su Yang said to her.

"No... I can handle it," Lian Li said with a resolved— even somewhat forceful expression on her face.

"..."

After staring at her for a moment, Su Yang spoke, "Why are you trying so hard? Is it because of what happened during that incident?"

"I was taught to work hard to fix my mistakes by my mother, and that’s what I am trying to do. I also don’t want to lose to Wu Jingjing or Zhu Mengyi... and I don’t want to be abandoned by you..." Lian Li said with a gloomy expression on her face, looking like she wanted to cry.

Although she was already feeling guilty for what she’d done to Su Yang before being slapped by her mother, the slap by Feng Xindou definitely made her feel more guilty about it afterward.

"..."

After a moment of silence, Su Yang spoke, "Even though I have had countless partners throughout my life, I have never abandoned a woman that I have accepted into my life that didn’t deserve it, and you won’t be any different. However, if you are still not convinced, we can make this official."

Su Yang then grabbed Lian Li’s waist and began thrusting his shaft into her again.

"S-Su Yang?!"

Lian Li didn’t expect him to suddenly start moving and m.o.a.ned loudly.

A few moments later, she could feel a load of hot liquid gushing into her stomach and filling her hole.

"W-What is this...?" Lian Li’s eyes widened with surprise when she saw a beautiful symbol suddenly appear below her stomach.

"This is a Family Seal— it is proof of our commitment to each other. Although it’s not activated yet, once activated, you will officially join my family and become my woman. However, there are a few rules you must abide by as a member of the family. Zhu Mengyi and Wu Jingjing are already a part of my family."

Su Yang proceeded to explain the family rules to Lian Li, who listened with a dazed expression on her face.

"Well? What do you think? Are you willing to commit to our relationship? Even though I am the family head, unless you betray me, I won’t be able to abandon you without any reason, or I will suffer a major backlash," Su Yang said to her.

"A-Are you really willing to accept me into your family despite what I did to you?" Lian Li looked at him with disbelief.

Hearing her words, Su Yang bit a hole in his thumb and showed her the blood coming out.

"What do you think?" Su Yang said to her.

Lian Li stared at his bloody finger for a moment before grabbing his hand and slowly pulling it towards the Family Seal on her body.

"I, Lian Li, with heaven as witness, swear that I will never betray you and that I will always remain faithful until the end of time..." Lian Li mumbled in a slow but clear voice as she pressed Su Yang’s bloody thumb onto the Family Seal, causing it to glow a golden color.

Meanwhile, almost as though something had attracted their attention, Wu Jingjing and Zhu Mengyi suddenly turned to look at Su Yang’s room simultaneously.

"Do you also feel that, Sister Jingjing?" Zhu Mengyi asked her.

Wu Jingjing nodded, "Yes... I don’t know what it is, but the Family Seal on my body is feeling a bit warm."

"Me too. Do you think it’s because Sister Li joined the family and the Family Seal recognized her?" Zhu Mengyi asked. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

"That’s very likely." Wu Jingjing nodded.

Inside Su Yang’s room, Lian Li rubbed the Family Seal on her body with a passionate gaze.

"You know, if you want a child with me, you can just ask," Su Yang suddenly said to her a moment later.

"Eh?" Lian Li looked at him with a surprised look on her face. How did he know that she wanted a baby with him?

"You think I wouldn’t notice you staring at Wu Min and Zhu Jiayi? Not to mention the look on your face while you stared at them? Even someone who doesn’t understand romance would be able to tell your desires," Su Yang said with a smile on his face.

"It was that obvious...?" Lian Li lowered her head slightly to hide the embarrassment on her blushing face.

"Then... if you don’t mind, just like Sister Jingjing and Sister Mengyi, I also want to bear your child," she said a moment later.

Su Yang nodded and said, "As you wish."

He then laid Lian Li’s glistening body on the bed before moving his h.i.p.s again.

"Aaaah~!"

"Aaah~!"

"Aaaahn~!"

Almost as though the Family Seal had boosted her endurance, Lian Li was able to continue without much rest, and she managed to endure a few more hours of intense cultivation with Su Yang before finishing with a load of fertile Yang Qi gushing into the deepest part of her cave and filling every nook and cranny inside.

"Thank you, Su Yang, for everything..." Lian Li mumbled in an exhausted voice before falling asleep on the bed.

Su Yang then removed his shaft from Lian Li’s body before sealing her cave with a special talisman, containing his Yang Qi within her body.

’Three children already, huh? I have only been in this world for a little over a year and I already have two children with another one coming in the near future. Who knows how many children I’ll have by the time we return to the Divine Heavens?’ Su Yang wondered silently with a profound smile on his face, feeling an indescribable emotion within his heart right now.
