Chapter 832 - A Line That Cannot Be Crossed

"I see... I understand..." Qi Yue nodded her head in a dispirited manner after hearing Su Yang’s response.

The other disciples felt their hearts tremble and felt the urge to hug her when they saw the sad look on Qi Yue’s face, who looked like she was just rejected by her first love, but alas, there was nothing they could do in this situation, as this was a line that should not and cannot be crossed.

Sometime later, the disciples continued to ask Su Yang questions.

"Sect Master, just what kind of place is this Divine Heavens?" One of them asked him.

"It’s another cultivation world that exists within the boundless void, where cultivators are much stronger and the spiritual energy is much more abundant," said Su Yang.

"Do you think we can also go to this place, Sect Master?" Another one suddenly asked.

"It’s possible if you enter the silver mirror that’s on the Southern Continent."

"Southern Continent? That’s impossible with the Jade Sea separating us!"

Su Yang shook his head and said, "Although this hasn’t been announced yet, it will be in the near future, so I might as well tell you now."

After taking a deep breath, he continued, "The Eastern Continent is currently working on trying to connect all five continents together through a teleportation formation that will allow people to visit other continents. As of this moment, the Eastern Continent is already connected with the Western Continent while the other three continents are still deciding whether they want to participate in this."

"Although it might be a bit costly, you have a chance to visit the other continents in the future."

The place was silent since Su Yang started talking until even many moments after he finished, clearly shocked speechless by the reveal.

"Any more questions?" Su Yang asked them.

The disciples snapped out of their daze after hearing Su Yang’s voice, and they continued asking him questions.

The gathering lasted for almost two hours, and once it ended, the disciples returned to their own homes, albeit feeling a bit down.

Many of them have tried to persuade Su Yang to remain in this world, but alas, their attempts were in vain as Su Yang remained resolute on leaving.

After the gathering, whilst everyone went back to their daily life, a certain disciple went to the Medicine Hall with tears in her eyes.

"Sister Lan! Are you here?!" Qi Yue knocked on her doors while shouting in a crying voice.

A few seconds later, Su Liqing opened the door with a puzzled look on her face.

"What’s the matter, Qi Yue? Why are you crying?" Su Liqing, who did not participate in the gathering, asked her.

"Su Yang... Su Yang... He’s leaving!" Qi Yue could no longer hold back her tears and cried out loud.

"He’s leaving the sect— this world— to a place where I can no longer see him! And... And I won’t be able to cultivate with him before he leaves!"

"Oh..." Su Liqing quickly realized the problem and why Qi Yue was crying.

Ever since she first met Su Yang, Qi Yue has been anticipating the day where she becomes an a.d.u.l.t so that she could finally cultivate with him, even counting down every day until she’s an a.d.u.l.t. But with Su Yang leaving before she could reach maturity, that dream has suddenly become impossible to accomplish.

Su Liqing watched Qi Yue cry with a perplexed look on her face, and she wanted to comfort Qi Yue, but she couldn’t find the strength to speak. After all, she will also be leaving this world with Su Yang, and she hasn’t told Qi Yue about it yet.

However, if she told Qi Yue now, who knows how she’ll react, and Su Liqing did not want to break her heart any further than it already is.

"Sister Lan! Why aren’t you saying anything? Please tell me what I should do!" Qi Yue suddenly asked her.

"I... I don’t know what to say, Qi Yue... What do you want me to do? Su Yang will be leaving in less than a year, and it’s impossible to stop him from leaving." Su Liqing sighed.

"I don’t know! Can you try to persuade him to cultivate with me before he leaves? I will become an a.d.u.l.t in less than two years! It shouldn’t make any difference if he cultivates with me now, right?! It’s only two years!" Qi Yue said. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

"I understand your feelings, Qi Yue, but that’s not how things work... Even if you are a month from reaching your a.d.u.l.thood, you’re still a minor and forbidden to dual cultivate. Or do you not mind offending the heavens by dual cultivating as a minor? The heavens are always watching, you know." Su Liqing couldn’t find a better excuse and decided to persuade her with the heavens’ name.

Qi Yue swallowed nervously after hearing Su Liqing’s words that definitely had an effect on her decision.

However, in the end, Qi Yue remained adamant and said, "I don’t care! As long as I get to cultivate with Su Yang, I will endure anything thrown my way! If it wasn’t for Su Yang, I would’ve probably died from the Four Seasons Snake’s poison!"

"Qi Yue... you..." Su Liqing was speechless. While she knew how much Qi Yue loved Su Yang, she didn’t know it was to the extent where she’d offend the heavens just to cultivate with him!

"Please, Sister Lan! Help me out! I really want to cultivate with Su Yang, even if it’s the last thing I do!" Qi Yue said.

Su Liqing sighed after hearing such words, and she said with a serious look on her face, "I will speak with Su Yang, but I won’t be asking him to cultivate with you since that’s a line I don’t want you or him to cross, do you understand?"

"I-I understand..." Qi Yue nodded as she wiped her tears.

"Follow me." Su Liqing said, and the two of them left the Medicine Hall a few moments later, slowly making their way to the Yin Yang Pavilion.
