Chapter 914 - Inside the Frozen Azure Cave

The yellow talisman emitted a profound and ancient aura when it appeared in the world, causing the magical beasts that were flying at them to slow down greatly, as their instincts warned them to not get close.

In fact, two of the three magical beasts turned around and flew away a moment later.​​

However, one of them decided to remain and continue to chase down Su Yang and Xiao Rong, its eyes flickering with killing intent that could suffocate even a Divine Spirit Realm cultivator.

"So you decide to choose death, huh? Then die for me!"

Su Yang activated the talisman by pouring his spiritual energy into the talisman when he realized that the last magical beast wasn’t going to leave them alone.

The talisman immediately began emitting a gentle golden glow.

"Sword Talisman!" Su Yang tossed the talisman at the incoming magical beast.

Whoosh!

Although the magical beast couldn’t sense the Sword Will, it could sense that something incredibly powerful and dangerous was heading its way, so it immediately turned around and began running away.

However, the Sword Will caught up to the magical beast almost instantly, tearing its massive body to shreds just as fast.

Xiao Rong was speechless when she saw this, and she asked him, "Master, what was that just now? I could sense a familiar feeling from that talisman just now."

"Because the Sword Will released by the Sword Talisman is actually my own Sword Will. Well, at least Sword Will from my previous self," he explained to her why she was having that feeling.

"When I was still an active Swordmaster, I’d create these talismans using my Sword Will for emergencies and would sometimes even sell them when I needed money. They’re incredibly powerful and can kill even an Ancient Realm cultivator. However, they were also incredibly taxing to create, and they could only be used once, so I didn’t make too many of them."

"Let’s speed up. Hopefully, there won’t be any more magical beasts since I only have a few more of these talismans."

An hour later, they finally arrived at the peak of the mountain, where a massive cave entrance could be seen.

"We’ve finally made it. The Frozen Azure Cave..." Su Yang released a huge sigh of relief upon seeing the entrance.

"Let’s go inside." Su Yang then said, feeling a little impatient after finally reaching this point.

After walking for a few miles on a dim path that was somewhat illuminated by the glowing walls that would grow brighter as they went deeper, they have finally arrived at the end of the Frozen Azure Cave, a spacious and fully illuminated area with a pond in the middle.

Su Yang walked to the glowing pond and looked around the place, but Luo Ziyi was nowhere to be seen.

’She’s not here?’ Su Yang raised his eyebrows.

Perhaps she was also running a little late like him? Or maybe she left already?

Su Yang was more willing to believe that Luo Ziyi was running late instead of the latter reasoning.

"Xiao Rong, let’s—"

Before Su Yang could even finish his sentence, his body froze when a dreadful aura suddenly filled the place. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

’T-This presence... Impossible! What’s that thing doing here?!’

Su Yang turned to look at the other side of the room, where a large black lizard with black scales and a red symbol that resembled a face on its back was staring at them.

"Master... is that...?" Xiao Rong’s body trembled with fear when she saw the menacing entity at the back of the room.

"Don’t move! That is the Red-Faced Lizard! Any sudden movements and it will attack," he said to her using spiritual sense.

’F.u.c.k! What is this beast doing here?! How did it get inside the Frozen Azure Cave! Don’t tell me it climbed all the way up here?!’ Su Yang cursed inwardly, as he initially believed that the Red-Faced Lizard was inside the mountain valley.

’There’s no way we can defeat that thing even with my Sword Talisman! If Ziyi was here, that Red-Faced Lizard wouldn’t be here! What should I do? Should I just give up on meeting her now and run away with Xiao Rong using the teleport treasure?’

Su Yang didn’t want to give up after reaching the end, but there was truly no good solution to this mess besides running away with Xiao Rong.

Although he had plenty of treasures inside his black pouch that could deal with the Red-Faced Lizard, he didn’t dare to reach for it, as the Red-Faced Lizard would kill him before he could even take any of his treasures out, much less use them. Therefore, he could only resort to using the marble that was already in his grasp.

All he needed to do was crush the marble and teleport away.

Su Yang tightened his jaw in anger.

As much as he wanted to ponder some more, he didn’t dare to risk it.

Even worse, he noticed some minor movements by the Red-Faced Lizard mouth. It was clearly preparing to attack them with its unavoidable poison spit.

Su Yang gave up when he saw this. ’Damn it! How dare you interrupt my long-awaited reunion with Ziyi! I will definitely return to this place and skin you alive once I am strong enough!’

However, just as Su Yang began tightening his fists and the Red-Faced Lizard opened its mouth, a tyrannical pressure came out of nowhere, instantly flattening the Red-Faced Lizard into meat paste.

Su Yang’s movement froze when he felt this pressure, and his body subconsciously turned around to look at the only entrance that was also an exit for the Frozen Azure Cave.

"Ziyi..." Su Yang mumbled in a low voice when he saw a breathtakingly beautiful goddess standing by the entrance with a calm look on her ethereal face, and she was wearing a black uniform that he didn’t recognize.
