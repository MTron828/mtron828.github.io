Chapter 757 Disciple Rivalry

After spending the entire night cultivating with the three goddesses, Su Yang silently left the Yin Yang Pavilion whilst the ladies slept soundly in his room from exhaustion.

"One more year... I just need to hold on for another year..." Su Yang mumbled to himself as he continued his routine of cultivating with the disciples and lecturing his alchemy disciples.

And in the blink of an eye, three more months had passed since Tang Lingxi left Su Yang and returned to the Divine Heaven.

During this time, Bai Lihua managed to master Profound-grade pills and began studying Earth-grade pills. Senior Zeng also saw significant improvements to his alchemy abilities— to the point where he’s almost unrecognizable.

As for Cai Yan and Luo Yixiao...

"Welcome, Master! I was just about to call you! Look! I can finally control my Jade Flames!" Cai Yan spoke in an excited tone as she showed Su Yang the flickering green flames dancing on her palms.

In these three months, Cai Yan had cultivated with Su Yang nearly every day, reaching the Earth Spirit Realm only a week ago, and she had already mastered the flame controlling technique because she’d been studying it passively throughout the months.

"Congratulations, Cai Yan," Luo Lixiao said to her after coming out of her house because she noticed Su Yang’s presence. "Looks like your hard work has finally paid off."

"Yes, I can now finally start to practice alchemy seriously just like you!" Cai Yan nodded with excitement.

A mysterious smile appeared on Luo Yixiao’s face after hearing Cai Yan’s words, and then she looked at Su Yang and said, "Master, can you come to see me afterward? I need some advice regarding a few things."

"Sure," Su Yang nodded.

A few moments later, Su Yang entered Cai Yan’s room and began dual cultivating with her. Despite already reaching her goals and entering the Earth Spirit Realm, Cai Yan asked Su Yang if she could continue to cultivate with him from time to time, and of course, Su Yang accepted her requests.

After their cultivation, Cai Yan asked him, "Master, now that I am at the Earth Spirit Realm and have mastered my flame control, are you going to impregnate me soon?"

Su Yang nodded his head and said, "If that’s what you want, but I recommend you improve your cultivation a little bit more before you conceive."

"I understand!" Cai Yan said.

Sometime later, Su Yang gave her a quick lecture regarding alchemy and some advice for her alchemy flames control.

Afterward, Su Yang left her house and went to find Luo Yixiao, who was only a few steps away from Cai Yan’s house.

"Thank you for coming, Master," Luo Yixiao said to him.

"What did you want to talk to me about? It isn’t related to alchemy is it?" Su Yang said to her with a sharp gaze.

Luo Lixiao showed a defeated smile on her face, and she said, "As expected of you, Master. There’s nothing I can hide from you."

"Though, you are wrong about one thing— this is somewhat related to alchemy."

"Oh? Then what is it?" Su Yang asked.

"Well... I have already decided this before today many weeks ago, but I also want to cultivate with you," Luo Yixiao spoke with a calm expression on her face, yet her heart was beating like a drum.

"..."

After a moment of silence, Su Yang asked her, "Can I ask why you’d come to this conclusion?"

"There are two reasons, Master. One, I don’t want to fall behind Cai Yan who has already surpassed me in terms of cultivation, and finally, because I have come to love you, Master." Luo Yixiao spoke with a serious look on her face.

"Then why did you wait until now to ask me this?" Su Yang raised his eyebrows.

Although he could already imagine, he still wanted to give her an opportunity to relieve herself.

"Well, I wanted the two of us to be on an even field to a certain extent. After all, I had the advantage in both cultivation level and alchemy skills previously. Now that Cai Yan is above me in terms of cultivation, she will have to try and surpass me in alchemy while I am going to try and surpass her in cultivation." Luo Yixiao said.

"Rivalry between disciples, huh? Well, it’s not a bad thing, and it’s quite common. Many Masters even encourage rivalry, as it motivates the disciples to improve even more than normal." Su Yang nodded.

And he continued, "However, are you sure? You know what it means to cultivate with me, right?"

"Yes, I am well aware." Luo Yixiao nodded.

"Then when do you want to start?" Su Yang asked.

"Right now."

Immediately after saying those words, Luo Yixiao swiftly removed her clothes, letting them slide onto the floor and exposing her slim naked body to him.

Su Yang smiled after seeing this.

Sometime later, they entered the bedroom, and Luo Yixao sat on the bed with her legs closed in an elegant manner, yet Su Yang could still see the slit between her legs from above.

"Let’s get you loosened up first, shall we?" Su Yang approached her before grabbing her legs and spreading them wide open.

"Oh!"

Luo Yixaio released a surprised noise as she laid on the bed with her legs spread by Su Yang.

’T-This is much more embarrassing than I’d expected...’ Luo Yixiao cried inwardly as she felt a gentle breath on her little sister.

"Mmmm..."

Luo Yixiao’s body trembled after Su Yang gently blew air into her little sister, feeling a chill climbing her spine.

A second later, Su Yang kissed her slit and began licking all over her slit with his soft tongue.

"Aaahh..."

Luo Yixiao moaned in a gentle voice as she submerged her mind in pleasure, feeling her body temperature quickly heat up.

A few moments later, once Luo Yixiao’s little sister was soaking wet, Su Yang switched from his tongue to his fingers and inserted his fingers inside her warm cave, surprising Luo Yixiao.
