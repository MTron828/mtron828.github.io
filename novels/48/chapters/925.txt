Chapter 926 A New Home

"Heaven’s Favorite... How do we train someone like that?" One of the goddesses asked after a moment of silence.

"No clue. As much as I want to teach her normally, it could potentially hinder her progress instead. It would be ideal to have another Heaven’s Favorite teaching her... but we don’t have anyone like that in the sect."

"Wait... Sister Yue is also Heaven’s Favorite, right? Why don’t we ask her for help?" Someone suddenly suggested.

"Sister Yue? But we don’t even know where she is."

"I mean we can try looking for her. I think I heard rumors of her appearing in Martial Heaven 100 years ago."

"Who should go looking for her?"

"I will go if you let me take care of the babies first..." One of them volunteered for something in return.

"..."

The others looked at her.

"Okay. I don’t mind." Wang Yunxuan said, and she continued, "But let’s not make the little girl wait too long. One year— you get one year with the babies. Does anyone have problems with this?"

The goddess shook their heads.

"Then it’s decided. Sister Biyu will be the first to take care of the babies regardless of the tournament results, but she will have to look for SIster Yue afterward."

’Tournament?’

The second Su Family raised their eyebrows upon hearing this. What’s this about a tournament? VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

"Little girl, I’m sorry, but you’ll have to wait a little longer for a mentor. We’d like to teach you, but your talents are too great, and we don’t want to hinder your limitless future, so we will get another sister that has the same talents as you to mentor you. However, we don’t know her location right now, so we will have to look for her first. But if you need help or advice for anything, you can speak with any of us." Wang Yunxuan said to Yan Yan, who nodded calmly.

Sometime later, Wang Yunxuan turned to look at Qiuyue and said, "You’re from the Sacred Moon Palace, right? I heard from Sister Ziyi who heard from Su Yang. Your situation is a little special, and you’re running away from the Sacred Moon Palace, so we’re not sure what we should do with you. What do you want to do?"

After thinking for a moment, Qiuyue said, "I’d like to improve my cultivation as quickly as possible. Although Su Yang said that he’d take care of the Sacred Moon Palace and the Moon God for me, I don’t want to push all of my responsibilities to him. Furthermore, my cultivation has halted in the previous world due to a lack of cultivation resources and Profound Qi, so I am not sure where I should start now..."

"We may not know anything about the Sacred Moon Palace’s cultivation technique, but if you need cultivation resources, we have plenty of that. Even if your cultivation halted for a few thousand years, you’re still fairly young, so it won’t have any permanent effect on your future— as long as you cultivate diligently going forward." One of the goddesses said to her.

"Thank you, Seniors." Qiuyue nodded her head.

"As for your presence within the sect, we will keep it a secret and give you a new identity."

Sometime later, Wang Yunxuan said, "Now that everyone has a mentor, let’s go see your new living quarters. After that, we will give you your uniforms."

"Wait a second." Sister Biyu suddenly stepped forward and said, "The Sacred Lands forbid males from entering without permission, right? What about babies? We have a male with us, don’t we?"

She then pointed at Su Tianying.

"Now that you mention it... What should we do? Babies should be fine, right? After all, they’re just babies."

"Sister Yunxuan, maybe you can speak with the Sacred Empress and ask her for permission. He’s just a baby."

Wang Yunxuan frowned slightly and said, "Even if they are babies, I don’t think the Sacred Empress cares if they are adults or babies— men are not allowed, especially if we cannot tell her that they’re Su Yang’s babies..."

If she told the Sacred Empress that Su Tianying was Su Yang’s descendant, then there was a good chance that she’d allow it, perhaps even take care of the baby herself, but they are not allowed to reveal the fact that Su Yang is still alive.

"I mean... We can always not tell her and keep this a secret... We just need to make sure to keep the baby out of others’ view." Someone suddenly suggested.

"While we can certainly do that, I do not like the idea of lying to the Sacred Empress, especially since she’s the reason we have been able to live in relative peace for the past two thousand years." Wang Yunxuan said.

After the Su Family scattered, they came to the Sacred Lands in hopes to start their new sect, and after speaking with the Sacred Empress who welcomed them with wide arms, Luo Ziyi and the others began living a peaceful life in the Sacred Lands without needing to worry about intruders or attackers, as the entire Sacred Lands was protected by the Sacred Empress.

"If you make it sound like that, I guess so... Then what should we tell her? We obviously can’t tell her that he’s Su Yang’s child."

"We don’t have to tell her anything. Just ask her for permission without giving any details. This way, we won’t be lying to her, but she also won’t know anything."

"I will think of something. For now, let’s deal with their living quarters." Wang Yunxuan said.

Sometime later, the original Su Family led the new Su Family to their living quarters in the inner areas of the sect where Luo Ziyi and the other Su Family lived, making it also the most secure location within the entire sect.

Once the new Su Family settled in their new homes, they were handed their new uniform, giving them new identities.

Meanwhile, Luo Ziyi exited the Sacred Lands and made her way to the Frozen Palace in her new appearance.
