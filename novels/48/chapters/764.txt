Chapter 765 - Do You Think You Can Help Me Again?

"Xiao Rong, starting today, whenever I am free, I’ll please your body," Su Yang said to Xiao Rong afterward putting away her Yin Qi.

"Okay!" Xiao Rong immediately agreed since she couldn’t ask for anything more than this!

Sometime later, Su Yang went to speak with Liu Lanzhi about his small trip.

"Huh? You’re going to the other continents again?" Liu Lanzhi looked at him with her eyebrows raised.

Su Yang nodded and said, "I need to collect some medicine for Liqing, and I highly doubt I’ll be able to find them in the Eastern Continent."

"Liqing? Did something happen to her? Is she injured or sick? I hope she’s okay..." Liu Lanzhi asked with a worried look on her face.

"Don’t worry, it’s nothing serious. She’s only having trouble getting pregnant," Su Yang said. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

"She’s having trouble with pregnancy? Infertility?" Liu Lanzhi looked at him with a dumbfounded look, as she would’ve never imagined that Su Liqing would actually be infertile.

"That appears to be the case, so I am going to concoct a pill to heal her body," Su Yang nodded.

"I see... I didn’t know such a thing existed in this world... Of course, in your case..." Liu Lanzhi showed a bittersweet smile on her face.

"Anyway, I am going to leave in a few days. If you need anything, let me know before then."

Liu Lanzhi nodded and said, "I am already used to operating the Profound Blossom Sect alone. You don’t have to worry about me anymore, Su Yang."

"That’s good to hear."

Once Su Yang left the room a few moments later, Liu Lanzhi sighed in a low voice, "If I don’t learn to take care of the sect by myself, who else is going to protect the sect when you leave this world, Su Yang? It’s not as if I can just find anybody to take your spot after you leave..."

Sometime later, Su Yang spoke to his family about his plans.

"Lian Li, you’d mentioned that you wanted to look at the other continents, right? Do you still want to come despite your condition right now?" Su Yang asked her.

Lian Li looked at her stomach for a second before nodding her head and speaking, "Of course. If I don’t take this chance to explore now, I will no longer have that option once our baby is born."

"Very well, I’ll be taking you with me then," Su Yang said.

After speaking with Lian Li and the other goddesses, Su Yang went to knock on Qiuyue’s door, and he said to her from outside, "I’ll be traveling to the other continents for a while. If you need me, you know how to contact me."

After a moment of silence, Qiuyue’s voice resounded: "Okay."

Su Yang left her room shortly after to prepare for his journey.

A few days later, once Su Yang finished all of his appointments with the disciples, Su Yang brought Lian Li and Xiao Rong with him to the Holy Central Continent.

Meanwhile, Qiuyue stood by the window and watched as her flying boat disappeared into the horizon.

"Sister Lingxi... What should I do now?" Qiuyue sighed in a dejected voice.

Ever since Tang Lingxi left, Qiuyue has been feeling a lot lonelier, almost like she’d just lost a close friend, as she was used to having conversations with Tang Lingxi on a daily basis that she normally wouldn’t be able to talk about with others, especially Su Yang, because she would be too embarrassed.

Sometime later, on the other side of the world, Su Yang and Lian Li returned to the Holy Central Continent.

"I didn’t think we would return to this place so quickly after leaving. It almost makes me feel embarrassed to be here." Lian Li said with a bittersweet smile on her face.

A few minutes later, they entered the Lian Family’s household.

"Where are my parents?" Lian Li wondered to herself.

"Why don’t we call them?" Su Yang said before turning to look at Xiao Rong and nodding his head.

A moment later, Xiao Rong released a small portion of her aura, immediately filling the entire building with an overbearing pressure.

A few moments later, Feng Xindou could be seen flying towards them with somewhat messy clothes.

Lian Li raised her eyebrows after seeing her mother’s appearance that looked like she’d just gotten out of bed. However, it was way past morning so it didn’t make sense for her to wake up now.

Meanwhile, Su Yang immediately understood the situation and chuckled, "It seems like your husband is finally fulfilling his duties as your husband."

"Eh?" Lian Li looked at Feng Xindou with wide eyes as she finally understood the situation.

"I-I’m so sorry for appearing before you in such a fashion! We weren’t expecting any visitors today..." Feng Xindou hastily apologized to them, and she turned to look at Su Yang with a somewhat embarrassed look on her face, looking like someone who’d been caught in the act.

However, Su Yang remained calm and spoke, "Don’t worry about it— we were the ones who came here unannounced. If you’d like, you can even return to finish your business. We have plenty of time, anyway."

"That won’t be necessary..." Feng Xindou shook her head with a bittersweet smile.

Su Yang looked at her with a calm gaze, and he noticed a line of clear liquid flowing down her legs a second later.

Seeing this, he smiled and said, "The technique I gave your husband isn’t something that can be mastered in just a few months; it’ll probably take a few more years before you can be satisfied with him."

"A... A few more years...?" Feng Xindou looked at him with a baffled look on her face.

After a long moment of silence, Feng Xindou approached Su Yang and whispered in his ears, "I know this is extremely shameless of me but do you think... Do you think you can help me again just this once since you are already here? If I don’t satisfy this unsatisfied feeling in my body, I might go crazy!"
