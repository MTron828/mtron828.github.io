Chapter 804 - Connecting the Five Continents

"That’s great news!" Xie Xingfang said with a bright expression on her face.

Su Yang nodded, and then he said, "Anyway, where are the other two? I have something important to discuss with them."

"Something important? I’ll call them right now." Xie Xingfang said as she retrieved a communication jade slip and contacted Lord Xie and Xie Wang to let them know that Su Yang was looking for them.

"They said they’ll meet you at the meeting room," Xie Xingfang said to him.

Sometime later, Su Yang followed Xie Xingfang to the meeting room where Lord Xie and Xie Wang were already waiting.

"What’s this about, Su Yang?" Lord Xie asked him the moment he walked into the room.

Su Yang smiled and said in a calm voice, "How do you feel about connecting the five continents in this small world together?"

"What the heck are you talking about?" Lord Xie raised his eyebrows in a puzzled manner.

"I’m asking you if you want to visit the other continents and at the same time have visitors from the other continents."

"Is that even possible?" Xie Wang couldn’t help but ask.

Su Yang nodded and explained to them the situation, "I will be creating a teleportation formation in every continent, which will allow you to bypass the Jade Sea and travel to the other continents without any danger at the cost of a few hundred thousand spirit stones."

"Y-You can do something like that?" Lord Xie looked at him with wide eyes, as this was beyond the scope of his views.

"I wouldn’t be talking about it if I couldn’t, now would I?" Su Yang smiled.

Lord Xie and Xie Wang looked at each other in silence.

A few moments of silence later, Xie Wang spoke, "While that does sound very interesting and will, without doubt, change the world and how we communicate with each other, there are a few problems that immediately came to my head regarding the situation."

"How can we be sure that those who come to our land are not hostile? I hope you didn’t forget about what happened with Golden Patriarch from the Holy Central Continent already. If he had used the teleportation formation to come to our Eastern Continent, that would have potentially been disastrous."

Su Yang then said, "You don’t have to worry about that, since the ruler of each continent will have full control of the formation, so you can choose who to send to the other continents. Furthermore, you can communicate with each other to make sure both parties are okay with the visit."

"If that’s not enough, you can simply deactivate the teleport formation you agree to accept visitors."

"Hmmm... That does root out a lot of problems..." Xie Wang nodded, and then he continued, "What about the other rulers? Can we really trust them?"

"Besides the Southern Continent, I have met and spoken with the rulers of every continent out there, and I can guarantee you that they’re reasonable people," Su Yang said.

"Of course, if you’re still worried, I can assure you that the Eastern Continent is currently the 2nd strongest continent in this world, and it’ll become the strongest by the time I leave this world."

"What..."

Lord Xie and Xie Wang stared at him with gawking looks on their faces. The Eastern Continent will become the strongest by the time he leaves in a year? That doesn’t seem plausible even in the slightest, especially since the Holy Central Continent existed.

"So? What do you think? Are you going to agree? I have already created a formation in the Western Continent," Su Yang said to them sometime later.

"Since you obviously agree to this, there’s no reason for us to disagree. If you think it’ll benefit the Eastern Continent, by all means, do what you must." Xie Wang said to him.

Su Yang nodded and said, "Then I will create the formation near the Jade Sea."

Sometime later, Su Yang left the Xie Family’s household and headed directly to the Jade Sea, where he spent two days creating the formation.

Once it was completed, Su Yang activated it with his spiritual energy without fully activating it.

"There. Now the Eastern Continent and the Western Continent are connected." Su Yang said.

"Shall we go to the Holy Central Continent now to speak with my parents?" Lian Li asked him.

Su Yang nodded, "We shall."

Thus, Su Yang and Lian Li flew to the Holy Central Continent on the flying boat with Xiao Rong still following behind.

"Hm? You have something important to talk about? Go ahead, I’m all ears." Feng Xindou said after Su Yang approached her.

Su Yang then explained to her the situation regarding the other continents and his plans to connect all five continents together, allowing everybody to finally have the option to visit each other.

"Connecting all five continents, huh... My husband is currently ’training’ in his room, but he should be done soon in an hour." Feng Xindou said, and then she continued with a smile on her face, "In the meantime... Why don’t we go ahead and start our treatment? After all, it’s been a week since you last treated me."

Su Yang did not say anything and merely nodded with a smile on his face.

"What’s with that look, Li’er? Do you also want to join us?" Feng Xindou noticed Lian Li’s speechless expression and decided to tease her.

"N-No way!" Lian Li quickly shook her head. "I am not cultivating in the same room as Mother!"

Feng Xindou casually shrugged her shoulders before grabbing Su Yang and pulling him into another room where they proceeded to cultivate for an hour.

Meanwhile, Lian Li waited outside with Xiao Rong until Emperor Lian showed up a few minutes later, which was much quicker than Feng Xindou had anticipated. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

"Hm? Lian Li? You’re back already? Where’s Su Yang?" Emperor Lian asked her.

"He’s with mother," Lian Li responded in a nonchalant voice.

"Oh..." Emperor Lian mumbled, feeling slightly awkward afterward.

"Anyway, since you’re already here, I’ll explain the situation to you in Su Yang’s place." Lian Li suddenly said, and she began telling him about Su Yang’s plans to connect the continents.
