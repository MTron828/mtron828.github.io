Chapter 784 - Cursed Treasure

"Do you mind if I try it?" Su Yang asked Ji Hong a moment later.

"Try? Try what?" Ji Hong raised his eyebrows in a puzzled manner.

"Try to destroy it," he responded with a smile on his face, and he continued, "Don’t worry, I’ll pay for this wooden sword even if I break it."

"If that’s the case, I don’t mind." Ji Hong nodded, feeling much more relieved after hearing Su Yang’s second sentence.

"Good. We can continue the exchange after I see everything else." Su Yang said, and he returned to looking at the collection room that had over a hundred treasures.

Sometime later, Su Yang stood before the Flower of Resurrection, a glowing red flower that appeared to be being burned by flames without actually being burned.

"This is indeed the Flower of Resurrection," Su Yang nodded with a smile on his face. "Here’s the treasure you wanted for it."

Su Yang then handed the treasure to Ji Hong.

"Thank you very much for your business, esteemed guest. Allow me to take it out for you."

A few moments later, Ji Hong retrieved the Flower of Resurrection and placed it inside a wooden box to preserve its quality before handing it over to Su Yang.

"Then let’s finish our last exchange with the cursed sword," Su Yang said as he approached the cursed sword.

However, right as Ji Hong tried to open the display case, Su Yang suddenly said, "Wait a second."

"Is there something wrong?" Ji Hong asked.

"Cursed treasures have a consciousness of their own, and it can tell that I want it, so it wants to challenge me. If you touch it now, it might try to harm you."

Hearing Su Yang’s words, Ji Hong immediately jerked his hands back in a startled manner, almost like he accidentally touched something too hot.

A moment later, Su Yang opened the display case and grabbed the wooden sword with Sword Qi protecting his body.

Shaaaaaa!

The moment Su Yang touched the wooden sword, black smoke began coming out, almost like it was scorching his skin.

"E-Esteemed guest! Are you okay?!" Ji Hong exclaimed in a startled voice, and he looked at Su Yang with a worried look on his face.

"Don’t worry, it’s not hurting me. The smoke is not because I am getting burned— it’s because I am suppressing its cursed presence." Su Yang said, and he continued, "Let’s go outside. I want to see if this cursed treasure is really that durable."

Ji Hong nodded and followed Su Yang outside.

"By the way, are you really okay with breaking it? It may be cursed, but it’s’ still a treasure nevertheless..." Ji Hong asked him out of curiosity.

"If it breaks over something so simple, it isn’t worthy of being called a cursed treasure." Su Yang said with a smile on his face.

"Oh? You’re back? How did it go?" Lian Li asked them after they left the collection room.

Su Yang nodded and explained to her their current situation.

"That wooden stick is the cursed treasure? Unbelievable..." Lian Li said as she looked at the wooden sword that was slightly trembling in Su Yang’s grasp. If it was laying in the middle of the street, she would’ve definitely treated it as trash and ignored it.

"How are cursed treasures even created?" Lian Li asked a moment later.

"Nobody really knows, but because cursed treasures always have their own consciousness, people believe they are spiritual treasures that have turned evil after gaining its own consciousness." Su Yang said.

And he continued, "Some spiritual treasures will gain their own consciousness naturally whilst some spiritual treasures are born with their own consciousness."

"I see..." Lian Li nodded.

Sometime later, they arrived in a vast and empty court somewhere in the Ji Family’s household.

"Okay, esteemed guest. You can do whatever you want here." Ji Hong said to them.

Su Yang nodded and said, "The both of you should stand back. Things might get a little hectic."

Ji Hong and Lian Li proceeded to distance themselves from Su Yang. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Once they were distanced enough, Su Yang created a defensive formation around himself just in case.

A few moments later, Su Yang tossed the wooden sword into the sky and said, "If you can survive this hit, I’ll make you my weapon!"

Su Yang retrieved another sword before releasing his Sword Will.

"Heaven Consuming Strike!"

An immense pressure appeared in the area, and the sword in Su Yang’s hands gushed with black flames.

Su Yang swung the sword towards the sky a second later, sending a massive arc of black flames flying at the cursed weapon.

If the cursed weapon had a face to make an expression right now, it would definitely be a face filled with fear and shock.

WHOOSH!

The Heaven Consuming Strike consumed the entire cursed treasure and continued to fly towards the heavens, taking the cursed sword with it.

As for the defensive barrier Su Yang had created, it was easily shattered by his own technique.

Ji Hong’s jaw dropped to the ground when he witnessed Su Yang’s strength.

’If he wanted to, he could easily destroy an entire city or two with that technique!’ Ji Hong cried inwardly.

Even Lian Li was not spared from the shock and cried inwardly, ’Heavens! He had such a powerful sword technique?! If he’d used that during our spar... I wouldn’t be standing here right now!’

Su Yang remained standing there afterward, and he stared at the sky, almost like he was waiting for the cursed sword to come back down.

"I don’t think that cursed treasure would be able to survive such an attack..." Ji Hong mumbled in a dazed voice.

"I doubt even a Divine-grade treasure would be able to survive that..." Lian Li also mumbled.

However, to their surprise, they could see a small dot in the sky that grew larger and larger.

"Heavens! It survived! The cursed treasure actually survived!" Ji Hong exclaimed when the cursed sword returned to the ground.
