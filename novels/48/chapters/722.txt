Chapter 723 Blossom Spring

Seeing their bewildered expressions, Tang Lingxi smiled and said, "I don‚Äôt know whether Su Yang already told you or not, but I am someone from the Divine Heavens, and I also belong to the Su Family."

"And in order to reunite with Su Yang, I have consumed a forbidden pill called Soul Invading Pill, which allowed me to transmigrate my soul into another body and take control of their body temporarily. I know that sounds wrong, but you don‚Äôt have to worry, as this body‚Äî whose original owner is named Hong Yu‚Äôer‚Äî has given me permission to use her body, and in return for borrowing her body, I am helping her cultivate."

After a moment of silence, Zhu Mengyi spoke, "Heavens... This Soul Invading Pill‚Äî what a terrifyingly powerful pill! I cannot even begin to imagine the terror it would cause if such a pill landed in the wrong hands..."

"It is indeed quite a scary pill, but that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a forbidden pill, and it‚Äôs not something anyone can just obtain, as it‚Äôs heavily regulated and protected by the Alchemy God, who is also the only person in the world that can concoct such a pill, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about it getting into the wrong hands."

"The Alchemy God...?" Zhu Mengyi wondered what kind of person this Alchemy God is.

"Anyway, enough about me. Tell me about yourselves‚Äî junior sisters who have accepted Su Yang‚Äôs Family Seal."

The three ladies then proceeded to introduce themselves.

However, right as they were going to mention their backgrounds, Tang Lingxi said to them, "You don‚Äôt have to tell me your backgrounds, I don‚Äôt really care about it."

After all, as the princess of the Asura God Clan, no matter how impressive their backgrounds may be in this world, it wouldn‚Äôt even qualify to be compared to the Asura God Clan. Furthermore, one‚Äôs background did not matter in the Su Family, so it wouldn‚Äôt have mattered regardless.

"Instead of your background, I want to hear about your experiences with Su Yang. But we should go somewhere more comfortable. Follow me to my room," Tang Lingxi said to them as she entered the Ying Yang Pavilion.

"I guess it‚Äôs your room now," Su Yang shook his head with a smile on his face.

"Anyway, you girls can go ahead without me. I have something else to do right now."

"Okay." They nodded before leaving him alone.

Once the ladies went inside the Yin Yang Pavilion, Su Yang turned around and began making his way back to the Medicine Hall.

"Su Yang? Did you forget something?" The disciples inside the Medicine Hall were puzzled to see him return so quickly.

"Something like that," he nodded.

"If you‚Äôre here for Master, she just left the building not long ago," one of the disciples said to him.

"Hm? Where did she go?" Su Yang raised his eyebrows, as Su Liqing rarely leaves the Medicine Hall.

"Master went to the Blossom Spring to clean herself. She should be back in an hour," said the disciples.

"Blossom Spring? This is my first time hearing of this place." Su Yang said with a slightly surprised expression. How come he‚Äôs never heard of this place before?

"Ah, that‚Äôs probably because only female sect elders are allowed to go there, and it‚Äôs located in a secure area somewhere on the Blossom Mountain a few miles outside our sect, so not many people know about it. We only know about it because our Master goes there once a month to bathe in the spring that is also said to cleanse impurities within one‚Äôs body."

"Cleanse one‚Äôs impurities?" Su Yang asked the disciples a moment later, "Where can I find this Blossom Mountain?"

"I‚Äôm not exactly sure about its exact location, but it should be towards the south."

"Thank you," Su Yang said to them before leaving the Medicine Hall.

Once Su Yang left, the disciples sighed, "Haaaa... It must be nice to have so much of Su Yang‚Äôs attention. If only I was in the Master‚Äôs shoes."

"Keep dreaming junior sister. Su Yang is too much for us. We‚Äôre already immensely lucky to get to cultivate with him. Don‚Äôt push your luck too much."

"What‚Äôs wrong with dreaming? It‚Äôs called dreaming for a reason!" Y√¥ur favorite ùíèovels at n/ùíê(v)el/bin(.)com

While the disciples chatted with each other, Su Yang flew towards the south even after he left the sect.

A few miles later, Su Yang could see a small but beautiful mountain that was filled with blossom trees, and at the end of the mountain, there was a small spring that was also covered in blossom petals that had fallen from the large blossom tree that was located right next to the spring, resembling the Celestial Pond.

Once Su Yang got closer to the spring, he was able to see Su Liqing‚Äôs beautiful figure bathing in the Blossom Spring with her eyes closed, and he decided to approach her.

Meanwhile, Su Liqing was completely relaxed and unaware of Su Yang‚Äôs presence.

"I never knew such a beautiful place existed until today," Su Yang‚Äôs voice suddenly resounded, startling Su Liqing.

"S-Su Yang?! What are you doing here? You nearly gave me a heart attack!" Su Liqing sighed in relief after realizing that it was him.

"I‚Äôm sorry if I scared you just now. As for what I am doing here... have you already forgotten what I said to you not long ago?" Su Yang said to her with a smile on his face as he descended onto the ground beside the spring.

"Eh? But you said tomorrow... That‚Äôs why I am preparing myself right now." Su Liqing said with a dazed expression on her face.

"I know, but I cannot wait, so here I am," he said, still with a smile on his face. "Or are you going to keep me waiting until tomorrow?"

Su Liqing chuckled in a defeated voice before nodding her head, "Can you at least wait until I clean my body? Of course, you can join me if you want."

"I wouldn‚Äôt refuse such an offer even if it‚Äôs the last thing I do," Su Yang said, and he removed his clothes before entering the Blossom Spring with Su Liqing.
