Chapter 519 Waking Up

After leaving Su Yang’s room, Qiuyue dropped to her knees with her face flushed with redness.

’I did it... I finally did it!’

Qiuyue could still feel her heart beating crazily fast, feeling as though it could burst out of her chest at any moment now.

She couldn’t believe that she’d actually manage to do something so vulgar to Su Yang, and while he was asleep, too.

’But... I probably won’t be able to do it again, especially if he’s not sleeping...’ she sighed a moment later.

Even though she had the courage to do it this time, she wasn’t confident that she could do it again, especially if he was awake, as that was simply too bold and embarrassing for a maiden like her at this moment. After all, it required her to muster all of her courage to do something like this while he was asleep, and she couldn’t even imagine Su Yang watching her giving him a fetallio without giving herself a headache.

However, no matter what, this event was a huge step forward for Qiuyue, who must prepare herself for the future when the curse on her is finally lifted.

"Are you okay, Senior Qiuyue?" Qin Liangyu asked her with a worried tone after seeing her kneeling on the ground with a dazed expression.

"I-I am fine," she responded after clearing her throat and standing up.

"That’s good to hear. What about Su Yang? Do you think he’ll recover faster with your Yin Qi?"

"Who knows..." Qiuyue shrugged her shoulders. "We can only wait for the results now."

"By the way, there’s no need for you to be so formal. We are no longer strangers, and you are someone who has experienced even more than me with him. If we have to rank our positions, you are already above me, since you have given him your body whilst I have not."

"Eh...? Senior... Sister Qiuyue hasn’t cultivated with him yet?" Qin Liangyu stared at her with wide eyes filled with surprise, as she was sure that they have long dual-cultivated with each other. "If you don’t mind me asking, what are you waiting for?"

"It’s complicated. If I could cultivate with him, I would’ve already done so long ago. However, because of a curse that restricts my choices in partners, I cannot cultivate with him yet."

"I had no idea that something like that could happen... However, even if that’s the case, you have been with Su Yang for longer than me, so I cannot be the senior one." Qin Liangyu said.

"One more thing. What happened to that cat? You have been teaching her how to become more ’mature’, right?" Qiuyue suddenly asked her.

"Xiao Rong... she’s a very quick learner. She’s almost like a completely different person compared to just a few days ago."

"What have you been teaching her...?" Qiuyue looked at her with wide eyes.

Qin Liangyu blushed and spoke, "It’s nothing special, really. I am used to teaching kids back in the Southern Region."

"The slower you teach her the better, since that lustful cat is the last person in this world I want to get ahead of me!" Qiuyue tightened her fists, her eyes filled with determination.

Qin Liangyu chuckled after hearing her words. She didn’t expect such a childish yet competitive side from Qiuyue, someone she still regards as her Goddess.

The following day, Su Yang slowly opened his eyes again.

"What happened yesterday feels like a dream, but..." He stretched his body for a good moment before noticing the wet stain on the bed that was near his crotch area.

Although barely noticeable, there were also signs of his clothes being tampered with. However, the most damning evidence that what happened yesterday was not just a mere dream was the dense Yin Qi that still filled the room.

In this entire world, the only person who could release this much dense Yin Qi was Qiuyue and Xiao Rong, and knowing Xiao Rong’s character, there could only be one person this Yin Qi belonged to.

It was obvious that Qiuyue was the one behind the Yin Qi, and he was certain that Qiuyue herself already knew that he would find out after waking up.

However, the real question was whether or not he should let her know that he was actually awake the entire time while she gave him a fetallio. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

"Injured or not, unless they are heavily drugged, anyone would wake up if you play with their treasured jewels so roughly..." Su Yang chuckled after recalling how she handled his jewels in an inexperienced manner, almost like a child playing with a toy that she likes but does not understand how to play with.

"Anyway, I should hurry and absorb her Yin Qi so that it doesn’t go to waste."

Su Yang then sat in the lotus position and began to cultivate, quickly absorbing all of the Yin Qi in the room.

A few hours later, after converting all of the Yin Qi to Profound Qi, Su Yang could feel his Dantian filled with spiritual energy again.

"As expected of someone from the Sacred Moon Temple, her Yin Qi is exceptionally dense and potent."

Unlike the Yin Qi that one absorbs straight from a woman’s body during cultivation, Yin Qi created from self-pleasure is much weaker, even incomparably weaker.

Qiuyue’s potent Yin Qi is a unique feature that only those from the Sacred Moon Temple’s blood shares, as they are directly related to the Moon, the strongest source of Yin Qi in this universe, and this is also a major reason why the Moon God cursed his own bloodline, as he refuses to share and taint this powerful bloodline.

After absorbing all of Qiuyue’s Yin Qi, Su Yang got off the bed and left the room.

The second he walked out of the room, Qiuyue’s figure entered his view.

"Father...!"

When Qiuyue saw Su Yang’s face, the event from yesterday immediately replayed inside her head, and she even began tasting his Yang Qi inside her mouth again, causing all of the words and excuses that she had spent many hours preparing to say to him when he woke up disappear like smoke.
