Chapter 654 - Is That Even Possible?

"How long have I been asleep...?" Wu Jingjing asked them after waking up sometime later.

"Not long. Only around fifteen minutes," Zhu Mengyi said to her.

"I see..." Wu Jingjing nodded before continuing, "I am going to wash my body before the children wake up."

"I will come with you," Zhu Mengyi said.

She then turned to look at Su Yang and asked him, "Do you also want to come?"

"How could I say no to that?" Su Yang followed them with a smile on his face.

Once they were in the bathroom, Zhu Mengyi and Wu Jingjing worked together to wash Su Yang’s body, scrubbing every nook and cranny of his body.

Zhu Mengyi even used her b.r.e.a.s.ts to scrub his back, and when Wu Jingjing saw this, she started using her own b.r.e.a.s.ts to wash Su Yang in the front.

A few minutes later, both Zhu Mengyi and Wu Jingjing used their hands to clean his little brother.

And right as they finished cleaning Su Yang, the babies outside suddenly started crying.

"You two can stay here and continue cleaning yourselves— I will take care of the children," Su Yang said to them before quickly rinsing the soap off his body with water and leaving the bathroom.

"Thank you, Su Yang." They said to him.

Once Su Yang left the scene, Wu Jingjing and Zhu Mengyi took turns cleaning each other’s bodies.

"I would dream of Su Yang returning to us almost every day after he left. I did not expect him to truly return to us, much less accepting us as his women." Wu Jingjing spoke with a warm smile on her face, her eyes filled with emotion.

"I know exactly how you feel, Sister Jingjing. I thought I would be fine raising a child by myself, but alas, after giving birth to Jiayi, I quickly realized how wrong I was and how difficult it was to raise a child without a father. I’m really relieved Su Yang returned to us, even willing to take us with him." Zhu Mengyi said as Wu Jingjing washed her body.

"How many women do you think are in the family?" Wu Jingjing suddenly asked her.

"I cannot even imagine. Not only is Su Yang incredibly handsome but he’s also incredibly talented, especially his alchemy skills. If he wanted partners, I’m confident that most of the women in the Four Seasons Academy wouldn’t mind becoming his wife," Zhu Mengyi spoke with a smile on her face.

"Alchemy? You should see his sword skills... If the female disciples at the Holy Sword Sect were to witness what I had experienced, they would literally wet themselves from shock and awe." Wu Jingjing said, recalling what she’d experienced inside Nine Spring Hall where she first met Su Yang.

"Honestly, I don’t care how many women there are within the family as long as I am a part of it," Zhu Mengyi said a moment later. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

"What a coincidence, Sister Mengyi. I also happen to have similar thoughts," Wu Jingjing smiled.

Sometime later, Wu Jingjing and Zhu Mengyi left the bathroom with a refreshed and clean feeling all over their body and returned to Su Yang’s side.

Inside the babies’ room, Su Yang casually stood there with both Wu Min and Zhu Jiayi calmly in his embrace.

"You are really good at this, Su Yang... How many children do you have back in your own world?" Zhu Mengyi asked him after seeing his calm demeanor when handling the babies.

"How many? Zero— At least none that I know of," he responded with a calm expression on his face.

"Huh? You don’t have any children in your previous life? Is that even possible?" Wu Jingjing looked at him with wide eyes.

"I refused to have children because I had a lot of enemies in my previous life, and I feared that their lives might be affected negatively because of me. However, it’s also possible that I might’ve accidentally i.m.p.r.e.g.n.a.t.ed some of my partners without being aware of it, as I was not born with perfect control over my Yang Qi," Su Yang explained to them.

"D-Does this mean we... We are the first ones to bear your children? At least willingly?" Zhu Mengyi asked him in a trembling voice.

"That’s right," he nodded. "You two are the first women I have willingly i.m.p.r.e.g.n.a.t.ed."

Wu Jingjing and Zhu Mengyi turned to look at each other with overwhelming emotions in their eyes, causing them to tear up.

After wiping the tears from their eyes, Wu Jingjing and Zhu Mengyi suddenly kneeled on the floor and kowtowed to Su Yang.

"Thank you, Su Yang, for giving us the honor of bearing your first children..." They said to him while trying their best to resist bawling their eyes out.

"You’re overreacting, you two. Hurry up and stand up," Su Yang said to them with a smile.

However, they remained kowtowing on the floor, unwilling to move.

It was at this moment the babies in Su Yang’s embrace began crying out loud.

"Look, you made the babies cry. If you don’t stand up, your dignity as mothers will disappear..." Su Yang said to them.

"..."

Hearing their daughters cry, they had no choice but to stop kowtowing and stand up.

"They are probably hungry after waking up," Wu Jingjing said after wiping the tears from her eyes.

Su Yang quickly handed the babies back to their mother so they could be fed.

Zhu Mengyi and Wu Jingjing proceeded to loosen their robes until one of their b.r.e.a.s.ts popped out, and they began b.r.e.a.s.tfeeding their daughter shortly later.

Once the room was quiet again and the babies were calmly drinking their b.r.e.a.s.t milk, Wu Jingjing suddenly said, "Su Yang, do you think you can come to the Holy Sword Academy and meet my father later? He was extremely shocked when he heard your name, but he wouldn’t explain it to me no matter how much I asked, saying that it would be for the best if I didn’t know about it."

"The Holy Sword Academy, huh? I’ll go when I have the time," he nodded.
