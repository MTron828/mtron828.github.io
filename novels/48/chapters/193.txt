"How dare you treat my Master’s Burning Lotus Pills like that! Explain yourself!" The female disciple was extremely angry at how Su Yang treated the pills that her Master, Wang Shuren, had concocted.

Even though she was instructed to ignore people that try to cause trouble there, she simply couldn’t ignore Su Yang’s actions.

"The pills are trash, so I no longer want it." Su Yang gave her a brief explanation.

But that only fumed her anger even further.

"T-T-Trash?! You dare call the only 100% effective Burning Lotus Pills in the world trash?! Do you even know anything about pills?!"

Su Yang shrugged in a nonchalant manner. "I didn’t come here for your pills, anyway. Go call Wang Shuren for me, I need to speak with her. Tell her that Su Yang is here to see her." DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

"I don’t care if you are Su Yang or Su Yin, you will not speak with my Master! Especially not after what you’ve done! If you don’t leave now, I will call for my Sect Elders to assist you!"

In her mind, for Su Yang to be so disrespectful towards the pills created by Wang Shuren, he’s clearly didn’t come here as a friend.

"There happens to be a Sect Elder in this building, so why don’t you go ahead and call for her? I’m sure that she’ll gladly assist me." Su Yang pointed to Wang Shuren’s building with a smile.

The disciple began trembling from anger. She’s never met someone as ridiculous as Su Yang before. His graceful appearances are only a disguise for the devil dwelling in his body!

"Where are you, Xiao Yawen? The next batch of pills is ready." Wang Shuren’s voice suddenly resounded from inside the building.

"I-I am coming!"

After hearing Wang Shuren’s voice, her disciple, Xiao Yawen, no longer cared about Su Yang and went back inside the house.

However, she had to stop at the door when she noticed that Su Yang was also trying to enter from behind her.

"Y-You! You must really be wishing to die today, huh!" she pointed at him.

Su Yang showed a slight smiled before taking a step inside the house despite Xiao Yawen standing right before him.

"W-Where do you think you are going?!"

When Xiao Yawen tried to stop Su Yang from going inside the house, she was shocked to find out that she wasn’t able to push him back even a centimeter with her peak Profound Spirit Realm cultivation base, feeling like she was trying to move a mountain with her bare hands instead!

"Are you finished yet?" Su Yang chuckled as he watched her struggle trying to push him out of the door.

"Burning Lotus Palm!"

Xiao Yawen suddenly raised her palms to strike Su Yang in the chest with the Burning Lotus Palm, one of their Sect’s signature techniques.

"W-W-What?! Impossible!" Xiao Yawen was greatly shocked when Su Yang didn’t flinch even after taking her Burning Lotus Palm to the chest.

"What are you made of, diamonds?!" she exclaimed while hugging the hand she used to strike Su Yang. Just like Senior Gao outside, she’d actually injured herself instead of hurting him.

After realizing that she wouldn’t be able to stop Su Yang, Xiao Yawen began screaming loudly, "Master! Be careful! There’s an intruder trying to harm you!"

"Intruder, huh. Well, you’re not entirely wrong." Su Yang did not stop and continued approaching Wang Shuren’s room.

"Someone is trying to harm me? Hahaha! Let’s see which ignorant—" Wang Shuren suddenly came out of her room laughing.

"It’s been a while, Wang Shuren." Su Yang greeted her with a smile on his face.

"Hahaha...haha...ha... eh?" Wang Shuren’s laughing slowly came to a stop when she saw Su Yang’s handsome face.

"Y-Y-You are...!" Although she didn’t immediately recognize him, once she finally recalled his face, Wang Shuren began trembling from excitement.

"Master!" Wang Shuren did not care that her own disciple was standing only a few feet away from her and immediately dropped on her knees to kowtow to Su Yang.

"I don’t recall accepting you as my disciple," Su Yang said to her.

"Don’t be like that, Su Yang..." Wang Shuren said with a bitter smile.

Meanwhile, Xiao Yawen stared at her Master and Su Yang with bewildered eyes, seemingly in disbelief.

She couldn’t believe that they actually knew each other, not to mention how close their relationship looked.

"Anyway, what are you doing here? Do you need resources from me? A pill, perhaps?" Wang Shuren could only think of this one reason as to why he appeared before her.

"You are quick to the point, just like before. I like it," Su Yang smiled. "That’s right, I wanted you to concoct a pill for me, but..."

"Wanted? Why the past tense?" she asked with a puzzled expression.

"After seeing the Profound Advancement Pills you concocted, I don’t think you will be able to handle what I have in plan for you."

"Eh? What do you mean by that?"

Seeing how she really looked puzzled, Su Yang shook his head and said, "I bought a few of your pills just now, and I have to say that after seeing the quality of the pills, I am greatly disappointed."

"Though..." Su Yang suddenly moved his head closer to Wang Shuren and began sniffing her exposed neck. "There are scents of high-quality Profound Advancement Pills on your body... Can you explain that to me?"

Wang Shuren blushed when Su Yang got so close to her, and she started laughing after hearing his words, "Oh, that! Hahaha..."

She moved her soft lips near his ears and whispered, "You see, I am selling these low-quality pills on purpose... Since both low-quality pills and high-quality pills have 100% chance to promote someone from the Elementary Spirit Realm to the Profound Spirit Realm, I might as well sell the bad ones to others and leave the good ones for my own Sect, right? Even my own disciple isn’t aware of this, so keep this a secret, okay?"

Once Su Yang learned of her tactics, he couldn’t help but burst out laughing. He had a feeling that it would be something like this, but to think that Wang Shuren would turn out to be such a shrewd individual.
