Chapter 972 Can I Embrace You Tonight?

Su Yang entered the massage parlor a few minutes after Mei Xing opened up the store, and when he arrived, he saw Mei Xing and Feng Tianwei in the midst of what appeared to be a staring contest.

"What are you two doing?" He asked them.

"M-Manager! This woman waited until we left the store before breaking and entering!" Mei Xing said while pointing at Feng Tianwei. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Su Yang raised his eyebrows after hearing this, and then he chuckled, "She didn’t break in. I was the one who allowed her to enter last night after you left."

"Eh? You did? Why?" Mei Xing asked.

"To give her a massage, of course."

"But you limited the number of priority customers we get a day... or did you decide to change it?"

"No, it’s still the same. I was just doing her a favor since she helped me greatly. In fact, she’s the reason why your mother was allowed to leave the brothel."

"R-Really?" Mei Xing turned to look at Feng Tianwei.

She then lowered her head and apologized, "I’m sorry for mistaking you as a burglar."

"Would a burglar even sleep in the place they plan on robbing?" Feng Tianwei asked her.

"N-Now that I think about it..." Mei Xing mumbled.

"Did missing a night’s worth of sleep already start affecting your ability to think?" Su Yang joked.

Mei Xing didn’t respond and merely blushed in silence.

"Anyways, I have already stayed here for long enough." Feng Tianwei said as she stood up.

"Don’t forget about our agreement." Su Yang said to her as she made her way towards the exit.

Feng Tianwei didn’t say anything and merely waved her hands in a casual manner.

The day then proceeded normally.

Of course, since Mei Xing didn’t sleep last night, she started dozing off midway through the day, but she managed to endure it until the end of the day.

"Do you want me to carry you back again?" Su Yang asked her.

"Please, Manager..." she nodded, almost falling asleep from that movement alone.

Once Mei Xing felt Su Yang’s back, she immediately rested her head on his back and fell asleep.

When Su Yang returned to the hotel and Mei Ying saw Mei Xing’s state, she sighed with a bittersweet smile, "So she didn’t sleep last night again..."

"I fully understand why you want to give her days off now..."

She then continued, "Manager, I think I can start working tomorrow."

"Hmm... Let me examine your body to see if you’re able to work."

Mei Ying nodded.

Once he laid Mei Xing on the bed, Su Yang began examining her body.

Of course, even without examining her body, Su Yang was confident that Mei Ying was already fully healed.

After all, she consumed a pill created by the God of Alchemy.

The only reason he hasn’t told her that she’s fully healed was to let her rest more, as the pills only affected her physical body, not her mind.

"I think it should be fine if you start working tomorrow as long as you don’t exert yourself too much."

"Great! I have been getting bored from lying in bed all day for the last few days!" Mei Ying appeared ecstatic that she finally got to work again.

Though she was more excited about the fact that she’ll finally be able to assist Su Yang and repay some of their debt to him even if it wasn’t worth anything compared to what he has done for them.

Su Yang then massaged Mei Ying’s body for half an hour before retiring for the day inside his room.

However, about an hour later, Mei Ying knocked on his door.

"Is there something wrong?" He asked her.

"No," she shook her head.

And she continued in a somewhat timid voice, "I... I have been thinking about how I can repay you for everything you have done for us, but I don’t really have anything of value besides my experience, so if you ever feel ’stressful’, you can ask me for help, and I will do my best to relieve your stress."

"I-I know that my body is dirty from working many years in this city and that my body is pretty much worthless, but if you’re okay with someone like me..."

Su Yang stopped his cultivation and stood up.

"Take a seat." He then pointed at the bed behind him.

Mei Ying nodded and entered the room before closing the door behind her.

Once she was seated on the bed, Su Yang sat beside her and said, "Even if you— or others— see yourself as dirty or worthless, you’re nothing like that in my eyes."

"I don’t judge a woman’s worth based on their body or their background— only their character and actions."

"In my eyes, you’re a hardworking mother who is trying her best to improve her daughter’s life. That alone makes you more valuable than many people I have met in the past, and those people are all individuals with powerful backgrounds and plenty of authority within the Four Divine Heavens."

"Also, I am not fond of women using their body as a sign of ’gratitude’ or to repay their debt, so if you’re going to approach me, give it to me straight."

Mei Ying swallowed nervously after hearing his words, and she lowered her head, "I’m sorry. Please give me a second chance."

Su Yang nodded.

Mei Ying then stood up and walked out of the room.

A moment later, she knocked on the door and spoke from the outside, "Manager, may I have some of your time?"

"Yes."

Once she got his approval, Mei Ying entered the room and closed the door before walking up to him.

"Manager, I have been wanting to embrace you for a while now, but I never had the courage to ask, and with my daughter always around, it only makes things more difficult for me. Tonight... Can I embrace you tonight?" Mei Ying stared at him with an earnest gaze.

A smile appeared on Su Yang’s face, and he nodded.
