Chapter 751 Finding a New Sect Master for the Heavenly Swan Sec

"Ahhh~! Aaaaah~! Aaaaaaahn~!"

It has been over four hours since Su Yang began cultivating with Bai Lihua, and every time Bai Lihua believed she was at her limits, Su Yang proved her wrong by pushing her body even further and further, and they repeated this process until many hours had passed.

After cultivating for five long hours, Su Yang finally released his Yang Qi inside Bai Lihua for the first time, and his burning hot volcano erupted with a massive load of Yang Qi that he’d held inside his body for the past five hours, making it feel significantly more satisfying and explosive for Su Yang.

"Aaaaa~!"

Bai Lihua released a sharp and long moan as Su Yang’s Yang Qi gushed into her body like a powerful tidal wave, instantly filling every nook and cranny inside her stomach. However, the Yang Qi did not stop flowing even after Bai Lihua was completely full, and the excess Yang Qi leaked outside, creating a puddle of Yang Qi on the bed beneath them.

The moment Su Yang removed his beast from Bai Lihua’s cave, like an outburst, his Yang Qi gushed outwards and splattered everywhere on the bed.

A few seconds later, the Family Seal appeared on Bai Lihua’s body, and before Su Yang activated it, he explained to Bai Lihua the rules for the family.

"Do you accept?" Su Yang asked her afterward.

"I accept..." Bai Lihua mumbled in an exhausted manner.

After Bai Lihua’s approval, Su Yang activated the Family Seal with his blood, welcoming her into his family.

"Welcome to the family, Lihua. And you shouldn’t underestimate yourself so much. Look at how long you’ve lasted when you were ready to give up a few minutes into the session," he said with a smile a moment later. "This is relevant in alchemy too, so keep that in mind."

"I understand, Su Yang..."

Sometime later, Su Yang said to her, "I have refined the formation around the Heavenly Swan Sect so that not even Sovereign Spirit Realm Cultivators could damage it."

After spending some more time with Bai Lihua, Su Yang prepared to leave, "Anyway, I have appointments with some disciples in a bit, but I will come back next week. I will also leave some Profound-grade pill recipes for you to practice."

"Thank you, Su Yang," Bai Lihua said to him with a beautiful smile on her face.

"Don’t even mention it."

After Su Yang left the scene, Bai Lihua proceeded to stare at the ceiling with a dazed look on her face for many minutes.

"I’ll have to find someone else to be the Sect Master for the Heavenly Swan Sect before I leave with Su Yang to the Divine Heavens, but who should I pick?"

Sometime later, once she’d recovered enough strength to move, Bai Lihua left her building to find her disciple— Su Yin.

"Greetings, Master." Su Yin greeted her at the door with a respectful face.

"Su Yin, I have something important to tell you today," Bai Lihua said as she entered her house.

"I am all ears, Master."

"This might be sudden and come as a surprise for you but I... I plan on making you the next Sect Master for the Heavenly Swan Sect. I know you’re still very young, but you are the most talented individual in this sect, and I have seen you lead the other disciples efficiently. Furthermore, every disciple in this place respects you. You have what it takes to become the Sect Master— I believe in you."

Bai Lihua revealed her plans to Su Yin, completely unaware that Su Yin will also be following Su Yang to the Divine Heavens.

A bitter smile appeared on Su Yin’s face after she listened to Bai Lihua’s words, and she said with her head lowered, "I’m very sorry, Master, but I do not want to be the Sect Master. No... I cannot be the next Sect Master!" Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

"What?! Why not? Can you at least tell me your reason? Do you dislike it here at the Heavenly Swan Sect?" Bai Lihua asked her with a surprised look, as she didn’t expect Su Yin to refuse so quickly.

"T-That’s not it, Master. It’s just that... I won’t be staying in the Heavenly Swan Sect forever. Actually, I plan on leaving this place in a year or so..." Su Yin explained.

"What?! You’re leaving the Heavenly Swan Sect?! Where did this come from!" Bai Lihua was truly shocked now.

"I’m sorry, Master. I should have told you earlier but I haven’t been able to think about what I should say to you. However, this has nothing to do with the Heavenly Swan Sect! In fact, I love it here! The disciples are friendly and the sect elders are always so nice to me. It’s just that I have someone I love more than this place, and I have decided to leave this place to follow him."

"..."

Bai Lihua looked at Su Yin with a speechless look on her beautiful face. Someone she loves more than the Heavenly Swan Sect? There is only one person Su Yin loves more than anything in this world, and that was Su Yang, her elder brother.

"You... Are you going to the Divine Heavens with Su Yang?" Bai Lihua decided to ask her.

"Eh? How did you know?" Su Yin’s eyes widened with surprise after hearing the unexpected words ’Divine Heavens’ coming from Bai Lihua’s mouth.

"Because I..." Bai Lihua decided that it would be better to show Su Yin the Family Seal on her body as an explanation, so she lifted her clothes and revealed her Family Seal to Su Yin the next moment.

"That’s... Elder brother’s Family Seal...?" Su Yin mumbled.

Even though this is her first time seeing the Family Seal, she has heard about it from Su Yang and she could tell at a glance that it was the Family Seal because she could feel some sort of connection towards it as Su Yang’s little sister since she’s technically from the ’Su Family’ from birth!
