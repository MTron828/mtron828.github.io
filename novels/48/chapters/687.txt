Chapter 688 No Matter What I Do to Your Wife

"C-C-Can you repeat that? I-I don’t think I heard you properly just now..." Emperor Lian said to Su Yang in a shaky voice after a long moment of pure silence, his heart beating louder than it has ever experienced before.

Su Yang then said in a calm voice, "You don’t need the Four Elements Root to heal your wife; her condition is quite complex, but I can heal her if you give me three days."

"REALLY?!" Emperor Lian could not control his excitement when he heard Su Yang’s words, and he immediately grabbed Su Yang’s shoulders.

"Unless you are a woman, I would prefer it if you don’t touch my body," Su Yang said with slightly narrowed eyes that felt threatening.

"O-Oh... I apologize, where are my manners?" Emperor Lian quickly retrieved his hands and then continued, "Are you serious about that? If you can really heal my wife, I am willing to give you anything in my possession, much less the Four Elements Root!"

Su Yang patted his robes where Emperor Lian touched before speaking, "Her condition is caused by her unique body that produces an incredible amount of Yin Qi at a rapid rate, and if not discharged from her body after a period of time, her body will begin to experience backlashes, and in your wife’s case, her body will grow weaker and weaker, as the balance of her Yin Qi and Profound Qi is completely messed up."

"Imbalance of Yin Qi and Profound Qi? How does that work? Even if that’s the case, why is her condition so bad?" Emperor Lian asked him.

"Her case is a special one due to her unique body that produces much more Yin Qi than normal," Su Yang said, and he continued in a nonchalant voice and calm face, "When was the last time you had sex with her?"

"Excuse me?" Emperor Lian looked at him with wide eyes filled with disbelief.

"Did I stutter? I am asking you when was the last time you pleased her. The reason her body is like that is due to the extreme amount of Yin Qi that’s contained within her body."

"Uhh... I believe we haven’t done it ever since Lian Heng’s birth..." Emperor Lian said in a reserved voice. He would’ve never imagined that he would one day speak of his activities with his wife to someone he’d just met.

"I understand," Su Yang nodded a moment later, "Anyway, give me three days with her and she’ll be able to walk again after a few weeks of rest."

"R-Really?" Emperor Lian looked at him, still feeling doubtful about the whole situation.

If Su Yang wasn’t related to Immortal Fairy Su Yue, he wouldn’t even have considered letting Su Yang near his wife, much less ’heal’ her condition that no doctor has been able to solve for many years.

"Yes, but I have two conditions," Su Yang suddenly said.

"T-Two conditions? What is it?" Emperor Lian asked him. If it’ll help his wife recover, he’ll accept any condition no matter how ridiculous it may be.

"The first condition is that nobody will be allowed to enter the room while I treat your wife until she is recovered— not even you."

"And the final condition is that you will not utter a single complaint no matter what I do to your wife, and you will not blame your wife after the treatment."

"..."

Emperor Lian looked at him with a dazed face. What kind of conditions were these? What is he going to do to his wife that would warrant such conditions? However, he was not in any position to refuse, as this might be his only hope of healing his wife.

"If you do not accept these conditions, I won’t be able to help you or your wife. Although the Four Elements Root is important, it’s not necessary for me to heal Xing’er," Su Yang said to him.

"I accept! I accept your conditions so please help my wife!" Emperor Lian quickly said to him in a pleading voice.

Su Yang nodded and then turned to look at the dazed Xie Family, "Looks like we’ll be here a little longer than anticipated."

"Give me a piece of paper and something to write with— I will list out all of the ingredients required for this treatment," Su Yang said a moment later.

"Somebody get a piece of paper and a brush!" Emperor Lian shouted at the Heavenly Spirit Realm Cultivators standing not too far away.

"Yes, Your Majesty!"

They quickly scrambled around.

A few minutes later, they returned with some paper and multiple brushes.

Su Yang proceeded to write out a list of ingredients and medicine and handed it to Emperor Lian.

"The quicker you gather these things the faster I will be able to start my treatment," he said.

Hearing his words, Emperor Lian shouted again, "You all heard him! I want everything on this list within four hours! I don’t care how you get it! Even if you have to snatch it from a baby’s hand, you will do it! I will compensate for everything later!"

"Yes, Your Majesty!"

The dozen Heavenly Spirit Realm Cultivators took a second to memorize all of the ingredients on the list before running away at max speed.

Meanwhile, Su Yang said as he entered the room, "I am going to take a closer look at her in the meantime."

Once he was beside the bed, Su Yang gently pressed two of his fingers onto Feng Xindou’s neck, feeling her dry and dead skin. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

’Hmm... Her condition is worse than I’d expected...’ Su Yang thought to himself as he inspected her body with his spiritual sense.

"How is my mother?" Lian Li approached him from behind before asking in a low voice.

"Not good," Su Yang shook his head. "There’s too much Yin Qi built up in her body. The only reason she lasted this long is due to her cultivation base at the Sovereign Spirit Realm. If she had been in the Heavenly Spirit Realm, she would’ve probably died long ago. However, she’s not hopeless."

"If you say she can be saved, I’ll believe you, Su Yang." Lian Li said to him, her eyes filled with a sense of unwavering trust.
