Chapter 651 - Zhu Mengyi's New Technique

*Slurp* *Slurp* *Slurp*

Wu Jingjing rocked her neck back and forth in a gentle yet intense motion, sucking on Su Yang’s meatstick with passion and her eyes filled with hearts.

"Mmm..."

While Wu Jingjing skillfully worked the blade of the sword with her mouth, Zhu Mengyi used her tongue to massage the area below, gently licking his sack of jewels.

"Hmm... the two of you have gotten much better at using your mouth than before. You must have practiced a lot on each other," Su Yang spoke with a smile on his face.

"We cultivated with each other nearly every day before we gave birth," Zhu Mengyi responded. "However, we barely do it nowadays, as we are too busy with our daughter, and chances like this are rare."

A few more minutes later, Su Yang said to Wu Jingjing who had been working hard to please him, "It’s my turn to feed you my milk— get ready."

"Un!"

Wu Jingjing nodded before shoving his entire shaft deep down her throat and patiently waited for the eruption.

A few seconds later, the volcano erupted, and hot Yang Qi exploded from Su Yang’s mountain, gushing directly into Wu Jingjing’s mouth and down her throat.

"Mmmmmm!"

Wu Jingjing’s eyes widened with surprise as the volume of Yang Qi was much more than she’d anticipated. However, she tried her best to not block the passage in her throat and allowed everything to flow into her stomach, feeling as though she was drinking water without any swallowing motions.

Sometime later, Wu Jingjing removed her mouth from Su Yang’s meatstick and spoke with a s.e.xy smile, "I’m so full it feels like I am pregnant again..."

Su Yang chuckled at her words and said, "If you want another child, I will gladly assist."

"I will keep that in mind for the future when I am more experienced as a mother, as I am already overwhelmed by one child..." Wu Jingjing said.

"It’s my turn to taste your milk, Su Yang!" Zhu Mengyi suddenly wrapped her mouth around his shaft and began sucking it with the intent of squeezing everything out.

Seeing her aggressiveness, Su Yang was reminded of his time with her inside the cauldron room, where they cultivated with each other for days with barely any breaks in-between.

After sucking for a few minutes, Zhu Mengyi suddenly stopped and said to him, "I’m going to try something new, Su Yang. Don’t be scared if you’ve never experienced it before."

"Hahaha! Scared? Me? And I highly doubt whatever you’re about to do will become a new experience for me," Su Yang laughed loudly.

"We’ll see..." Zhu Mengyi grinned mysteriously for a brief moment before continuing to suck on Su Yang’s shaft.

’What is she going to do?’ Wu Jingjing wondered as she stared at Zhu Mengyi intensively.

A few moments later, Zhu Mengyi placed her hands right beneath Su Yang’s sack of jewels before she suddenly—

"Ah?! What are you doing, Sister Mengyi!?" Wu Jingjing cried out in a shocked voice when Zhu Mengyi suddenly summoned her Azure Alchemy Flames and wrapped them around Su Yang’s sack of jewels as though it was a cauldron.

"Calm down, Sister Jingjing. It won’t hurt him," Zhu Mengyi said to her.

"What do you think, Su Yang? Have you ever had your balls warmed by Alchemy Flames? And does it feel good?" she asked him afterward.

"Hmmm..." Su Yang pondered with closed eyes, looking as though he was trying to judge her techniques.

"It’s quite clever of you to use your Alchemy Flames in such a manner, but unfortunately for you, it’s not my first time experiencing this. With that being said, your control over the temperature and flames is pretty good, and it feels good overall. I can tell that you’ve continued to work hard even after I left."

"Eh? I’m not the first one who has thought of this? Who else would have thought of using their Alchemy Flames in such a scandalous manner?" Zhu Mengyi asked him in a slightly surprised and disappointed voice.

"Many Alchemists I have cultivated with in my previous life would start using their Alchemy Flames to please me after our second or third time together," he said to her.

"No way..." Zhu Mengyi mumbled.

"As I have said— there is almost nothing I haven’t already tried before after living for thousands of years. If you somehow manage to give me a ’new’ experience, I’ll reward you." ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

"Really? What kind of reward?"

"It wouldn’t be any fun if you knew," Su Yang said with a smile.

Zhu Mengyi nodded with a serious and resolved expression.

She returned to slurping his meatstick with her mouth shortly later and continued to use her Alchemy Flames to massage his jewels.

A few minutes later, Su Yang’s volcano erupted again, shooting his white lava into Zhu Mengyi’s mouth.

"Mmmm..." Zhu Mengyi closed her eyes so she could fully enjoy this moment and savor the thick liquid before swallowing it without hesitation.

’Ahhh... I have been longing for this sweetness and stickiness in my mouth ever since I first tasted it...’ Zhu Mengyi thought to herself, feeling incredibly satisfied.

Once Su Yang removed his meatstick from her mouth, Zhu Mengyi opened her mouth and showed him the small white lake in her mouth for a brief moment before swallowing everything in one motion.

"Ahhh... so tasty..." Zhu Mengyi sighed in a blissful voice and with an enchanting expression on her beautiful face.

When Su Yang saw her amazing expression, his sword trembled before stiffening even more.

He then grabbed Zhu Mengyi by her shoulders and gently laid her on the bed. Seeing the eagerness in Su Yang’s eyes, Zhu Mengyi chuckled to herself before spreading her legs wide open for him, revealing to him her wet slit.

Su Yang rubbed his steel-like rod against her pink slit for a good moment before inserting it into the wet hole.

"Ahhhh~!" Zhu Mengyi m.o.a.ned loudly as her inner walls were spread wide open by the monster serpent that invaded her cave, feeling as though she’d entered heaven.
