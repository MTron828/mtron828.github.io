Chapter 769 Ruan Family

"Thank you, Young Master, for your business here."

The young lady bowed to Su Yang afterward.

Su Yang nodded and suddenly tossed a few more spirit stones at her, "That’s your tip for doing a good job."

The young lady went to catch the glistening spirit stones in a hasty manner, feeling her heart throbbing like crazy afterward.

"Let’s go. Now I feel more comfortable with you walking around me in that appearance," Su Yang said to the little girl as he turned around and began walking out of the building.

"T-Thank you, Young Master! I will never forget this!" The young lady working at the bathhouse kowtowed to him as Su Yang left the place with the little girl following behind him.

Once they were outside, the little girl continued to lead Su Yang to the Ancestral Pavilion, which took them a little over one hour to walk there.

On their way to the Ancestral Pavilion, Su Yang’s handsome appearance and alluring aura attracted countless gazes in the streets from the pedestrians, mostly the women regardless of their age, almost like they have never seen a man as handsome as Su Yang before.

Sometime later, the little girl stopped walking before a massive building that had the sign ’Ancestral Pavilion’ placed in the front in a domineering manner.

"Big brother, we’re here. This is the Ancestral Pavilion," said the little girl.

"I see... Thank you for taking me here. Here’s your spirit stone as promised," Su Yang said as he handed her a sparkling spirit stone.

The little girl smiled for the first time when she held the spirit stone in her small hands.

"Thank you, big brother. I will go now," she bowed to him before turning around.

However, Su Yang suddenly stopped her and said, "Wait a second, little girl. Why don’t you stay with me for a little bit longer? I might have another job for you later."

Hearing the words, the little girl nodded with eagerness in her eyes.

"Good, then come with me." Su Yang said as he approached the building.

"Welcome to the Ancestral Pavilion."

One of the workers there approached Su Yang when he noticed them walking inside the building.

"Do you have a reservation with us today?"

"No, I don’t," Su Yang responded with a nonchalant look on his face.

"Then are you here to dine with us today? Although it’s full right now, if you wait an hour, there should be more room."

"I am not here to dine either. I am looking for the Ruan Family," Su Yang said.

"T-The Ruan Family?" The worker there looked at Su Yang with raised eyebrows.

"Which family do you belong to? Only those who are on the reservation lists are allowed to see them," said the worker.

Su Yang smiled and said, "I belong to the Su Family."

"Su Family? I have never heard of such a..." The worker suddenly paused in the middle of his sentence, and he stared at Su Yang with wide eyes.

"W-What is your name again, esteemed guest?"

"Su Yang," he said calmly.

"S-Su Yang!" The worker repeated in a shocked voice. Could this handsome young man be ’that’ Su Yang?! Immortal Fairy Su Yue’s rumored husband?!

"Here, why don’t we make this easier?" Su Yang suddenly retrieved a storage pouch and began pouring out spirit stones in front of the worker like they’re trash.

"Will you let me speak with the Ruan Family now? I won’t take too long." Su Yang asked him with a seemingly friendly smile.

"Uhh... esteemed guest... this is..." The worker became speechless after seeing the small mountain of spirit stones in front of him.

Even the little girl couldn’t help but stare at the glistening mountain with wide eyes.

"So? Which room are they in right now?" Su Yang asked the worker without even giving him the time to think.

"R-Right! They’re on the 3rd floor— they’ve reserved the entire floor." The worker unconsciously responded. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

"Thank you," said Su Yang as he walked past the worker and approached the staircase that was at the end of the building.

Meanwhile, the worker quickly began stuffing as many spirit stones as he could into his pockets before other workers there noticed the situation and also began taking some of the spirit stones.

Once Su Yang reached the third floor, he could already see over a hundred people in the room chatting with each other while eating their meals.

Furthermore, there was a stage in the middle of this floor, and there were two young Cultivators at the True Spirit Realm sparring with each other on the stage whilst the others watched and cheered.

"Hahaha! Get him Ruan Li!"

"Show him what you’re made of, Gao Chen!"

People from these two families shouted loudly.

Su Yang looked at the side that was cheering for this ’Ruan Li’ individual and quickly found someone that is likely to be the patriarch of the family— a middle-aged man with an overbearing aura and cultivation at the first level of the Sovereign Spirit Realm.

Su Yang then grabbed an empty chair before approaching this middle-aged man who had a beautiful woman sitting on his right side and a handsome young man sitting on the other side.

The people there quickly noticed Su Yang’s presence because of his handsome face and powerful aura that could not be ignored.

"Who’s that handsome young man? I don’t remember someone like him belonging to any family here!"

"I also don’t recognize him, but I can tell he’s from a powerful family just from his aura alone!"

Sometime later, Su Yang arrived before this middle-aged man and placed the chair down.

After sitting down, Su Yang asked the middle-aged man with a calm look on his face, "Are you the head of the Ruan Family?"

The middle-aged man immediately frowned and said, "Who the hell are you? And which imbecile gave you permission to come here? Stop blocking my view of the stage and get out of here before I help you!"
