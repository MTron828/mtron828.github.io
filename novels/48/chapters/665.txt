Chapter 666 - Public Humiliation

When the disciples in the arena realized what had happened, their eyes widened with shock, especially the male disciples, and they stared at Lian Li’s peerless figure like their life depended on it despite knowing that they could be punished for even daring to take a peek.

Even Wu Jiang was shocked speechless by Su Yang’s daring actions, and he finally realized what Su Yang meant by defeating her without hurting her! If he cannot harm her body, he can simply force her to withdraw! And what better way to make a woman withdraw than to strip them n.a.k.e.d in front of tens of thousands of spectators, publicly humiliating her?!

"Do you have no shame, you pervert?! How dare you even think of using such lowly tactics against royalty! I swear to god I will have your head for this!" Lian Li shouted at him with her body trembling from anger.

However, Su Yang merely shrugged his shoulders and said, "What else can I do? I only strike women that are my enemies."

"Then I am your enemy! No! You are my enemy!" Lian Li shouted before running at him again.

"Die for me, you damn pervert!"

Lian Li suddenly activated her Sovereign Spirit Realm cultivation base, strengthening the Sword Qi aura even more.

The blue sword in her grasp danced elegantly, and in the blink of an eye, Lian Li released a torrent of sword attacks at Su Yang.

"Your movements are being affected by your emotions— you should calm down," Su Yang said to her as he casually dodged her sword attacks.

"Shut up!" Lian Li ignored his words and continued to attack him without stopping.

Seeing this, Su Yang released his Sword Qi again, and since Lian Li was much closer to him this time, even larger holes appeared on her clothes a second later, revealing even more of her skin to the public.

"Ooooooh!"

The male disciples cheered for Su Yang inwardly after seeing this.

"Aaaah!"

Lian Li shrieked as she jumped away from Su Yang.

However, Su Yang did not allow her to escape and followed her this time.

"Stay away from me, you damn pervert!" Lian Li frantically swung her sword at Su Yang without any technique or elegance behind her movements while running away, looking like a scared little girl being chased by a monster.

"Do you give up? If you withdraw, I will stop chipping away your clothes. However, if you refuse defeat, you will sooner or later have to fight me while being n.a.k.e.d!" Su Yang laughed as he chased after her around the stage.

The spectators were speechless. What the heck are they watching right now? What happened to the sword battle?

"What on earth is even happening...?" Wu Jiang mumbled in a dazed voice.

Even Wu Jingjing couldn’t help but chuckle at this silly situation.

After running a few laps around the stage, Lian Li suddenly tripped over herself and fell on the floor.

When Su Yang saw this, his eyes flickered with a vicious light.

Whoosh!

An immense amount of Sword Qi that caused the entire world to tremble suddenly exploded from Su Yang’s body, catching everybody off guard with shock and awe.

It was a frightening amount of Sword Qi that caused even Wu Jiang’s heart to tremble from fear, much less Lian Li, who was directly below such a terrifying pressure.

"Die!"

Su Yang raised his sword and swung it directly at Lian Li’s neck.

"STOP! YOU CAN’T KILL HER!"

Wu Jiang screamed in a panicked voice, but alas, his reaction was delayed by Su Yang’s explosive Sword Qi.

"Ah..."

Lian Li’s life flashed before her eyes with the feeling of death looming right in front of her, and she lost consciousness before Su Yang’s sword could even reach her.

Clang!

The Demon Slaying Sword stabbed into the ground directly next to Lian Li, barely missing her neck, and the entire stage was cleanly split in half as a result.

"..."

The arena turned dead silent for an entire minute as the people there tried to comprehend what had just happened.

"Hm?"

After pulling the Demon Slaying Sword from the ground, Su Yang noticed a wet and warm feeling by his feet, causing him to look down.

And to his surprise, a small puddle of translucent water had suddenly appeared beside his feet out of thin air.

"I guess I went overboard in trying to scare her..." Su Yang mumbled to himself after realizing that he’d scared Lian Li to the point where she’d not only fell unconscious but also pissed herself.

"Toss me my stuff!" Su Yang turned to look at Wu Jingjing and said to her.

"Y-Yes!" Wu Jingjing snapped out of her daze and tossed his clothes and storage ring at him.

Once he had his stuff again, Su Yang retrieved a pair of Profound Blossom Sect’s disciple robes from his storage ring and laid it over the unconscious Lian Li as though it was a blanket before putting his own clothes on.

And then right before the gazes of tens of thousands of Holy Sword Academy disciples, Su Yang walked in front of Wu Jiang, their Sect Master, and spoke in a calm voice, "You are the only one left, father-in-law."

"..."

Wu Jiang stared at Su Yang with a serious frown on his face. Although he did not take Su Yang seriously at first, after witnessing Su Yang’s profound Sword Qi that caused even his heart to tremble, he no longer has a choice but to look at Su Yang as a real threat to him, the Sword Saint!

"Are you serious about challenging me to a sword battle?" Wu Jiang asked him after a moment of silence.

He then looked at Lian Heng, who is still being treated by the sect elders, and then at Lian Li, who was lying unconscious on the stage.

"Do you have any idea what you’ve done today? You have just publicly humiliated Emperor Lian’s beloved children before tens of thousands of people, yet you still want to fight me? What exactly are you trying to accomplish here?"

"I didn’t humiliate them— they were the ones begging to be humiliated by me, and if this Emperor Lian has a problem with that, he can complain to my face. In fact, I will be meeting him later," Su Yang said with a smile on his face. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

"What? You’re going to meet with His Majesty later?" Wu Jiang stared at him with wide eyes, clearly at loss for words.
