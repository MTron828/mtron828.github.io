Chapter 975 A New Receptionis

About two hours after the Heavenly Massage opened, a beautiful woman could be seen skipping the line and walking straight to the entrance.

When the people in line saw this, they immediately called her out.

"Hey! The line is back there! You dare skip the line so daringly?!"

The beautiful woman turned to look at the people before speaking with an apologetic smile on her face, "I’m sorry for the misunderstanding, but I am not here as a client. I actually work here."

"Eh?"

The people outside were surprised to hear this.

Since when did they have another worker besides the little girl working in the front?

After explaining the situation to the customers, Mei Ying opened the door and went inside.

"Welcome to Heavenly Massage— Eh? Mother? What are you doing here?" Mei Xing was surprised by her sudden appearance.

Mei Ying chuckled and pointed to the uniform she was wearing.

Mei Xing’s eyes widened with shock when she saw her mother’s clothing that resembled her own work uniform.

"T-That’s—! Does this mean you’ll also be working for the Manager?!" Mei Xing asked, her voice filled with excitement.

"Yes, I will be working with you starting today. Though we might not actually work side by side since there isn’t any need for the both of us at once." Mei Ying nodded.

"I have spoken with the Manager. He said that we can take turns working each day so that you don’t have to worry about missing sleep from studying, and I want you to rest every now and then as well. It’s not healthy for a young girl like you to be working every day, after all."

"B-But this job is easy! I only need to greet people and some other minor stuff!" Mei Xing said.

Mei Ying chuckled and said, "If you’re worried about your salary being cut in half for working less, don’t worry. The Manager said that he would count both of our working hours together, so my salary will also be your salary."

"If you say it like that... I guess so..." Mei Xing nodded.

Since her salary won’t be deducted and she gets to study without worrying about missing sleep, she didn’t have any reason to refuse.

’I have always thought about working the same job as my mother, but I didn’t think it would turn out like this...’ Mei Xing thought to herself.

"I will only be observing you today so I know what to do tomorrow." Mei Ying said to her a moment later.

"Okay." Mei Xing nodded.

Mei Ying then took a seat at the corner of the room and proceeded to spend the entire day watching her daughter working diligently.

Of course, since she was being watched by her mother, Mei Xing subconsciously worked even harder than before so that she wouldn’t disappoint her mother.

’This is my first time watching her work...’ Mei Ying held a motherly smile on her face throughout the entire day.

At the end of the day, after Su Yang finished massaging his last client for the day, he came outside and said while looking at Mei Ying, "Well? What do you think?"

"This place is much busier than I’d anticipated. I thought Mei Xing was exaggerating when she first told me how popular this place was..."

"It will only get busier in the coming days, so make sure you’re prepared." Su Yang said with a smile. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Mei Ying nodded with a solemn look on her face.

"Anyways, let’s go home."

They then returned to the hotel and retired for the day.

The following morning, Mei Ying said to her daughter, "Mei Xing, today will be your first day off. However, that doesn’t mean you should be wandering the streets since it’s still dangerous outside."

"I know, mother. I intend on staying here to study the cultivation technique." Mei Xing said.

"Okay."

Mei Ying then left the hotel with Su Yang.

Once they arrived at the massage parlor, Mei Ying took a seat behind the desk, something Mei Xing couldn’t do because she was too short, feeling slightly nervous for some reason.

"You’ll be fine." Su Yang patted her back.

"I will do my best, Manager," she responded in a resolute voice.

Before going into the massage room, Su Yang whispered in Mei Ying’s voice, "If you want, we can have some fun in the back after the day ends. This is the perfect opportunity since Mei Xing isn’t here."

Mei Ying’s face immediately turned rosy after hearing his words, and she nodded in a bashful manner.

A few minutes later, the doors opened, and Mei Ying began greeting the customers.

"Welcome to Heavenly Massage!" Mei Ying used her daughter as an example and greeted them with the exact same bright smile on her face.

"The waitlist is currently at five months if you don’t mind..."

"Yes, there is a priority system, but all of the priority slots for today have already been reserved."

"I’m sorry for the inconvenience, but to keep things fair, the priority system is on a first come first serve basis, so we can only take reservations for the day."

"Thank you for your understanding."

Time passed extremely quickly, and before she was even aware, it was already time for the store to close.

"Great work today." Su Yang said to her after satisfying his last customer for the day.

"Thank you... Mei Xing made it sound so easy, but it’s really not as easy as she made it look. My voice is already starting to change from speaking so much." Mei Ying said.

Su Yang chuckled, "Don’t worry, I have some medicine that will help you with your throat and voice."

"Thank you."

"Why don’t I give you a massage? You definitely earned it."

Mei Ying nodded, and she made sure to lock the doors before following Su Yang into the massage room, where they would conduct passionate acts that couldn’t be done with her daughter around.

But with Mei Xing in an entirely different location doing her own things, Mei Ying was allowed to go all out and act as her heart desired.
