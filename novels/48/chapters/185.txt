"H-How long have you known about it for?!" Qiuyue asked him with a trembling voice, her face flushed red from embarrassment.

She couldn’t imagine how Su Yang could’ve learned about her secret. They were together basically the entire time, so how did he manage to find out without her being aware?

Then she remembered Zhu Mengyi and how she’d left Su Yang alone with her for a few days, and she immediately pointed to her as the culprit.

"It must have been her!" she began cursing Zhu Mengyi inwardly.

"Just a few days ago," Su Yang said with a smile.

Although he didn’t plan to expose her in such a fashion, he still achieved what he had wanted.

"Su Yue, huh? It has a nice ring to it, don’t you think so too?" Su Yang laughed out loud, causing Qiuyue to cover her face with both of her hands to hide her embarrassment.

"Shut up! I was very young and foolish back then! A-A-And you were supposed to be dead! It is only something akin to a memorial, okay?!" Qiuyue began flustering with excuses coming out of her mouth nonstop.

Xiao Rong watched their conversation with a confused expression. Although she’s learned how to speak and read, her comprehension when it comes to human interaction is still somewhat lacking.

"What is there to be embarrassed about? It’s just an alias," Su Yang shook his head, feeling that Qiuyue was worrying about it too much.

And he continued, "I happen to have a few aliases in the Four Divine Heavens, too. What’s more, even someone as isolated as you should’ve heard of at least one of them before."

Upon hearing his words, Qiuyue no longer covered her face and instead looked at him with her interest piqued. She wondered what kind of alias someone like Su Yang would possibly have.

"Tell me," she suddenly said.

"Huh?"

"Tell me one of your aliases and I’ll consider this as fair trade," she then said.

Su Yang shook his head again and said, "Since when are we trading aliases? It’s not my fault that you didn’t do a good job hiding your own alias."

Qiuyue was quite displeased that she wouldn’t be able to learn even a single of his alias, but she also couldn’t refute his words. After all, it was entirely her fault that she created such an alias in the first place without a care in the world.

If anything, she should be happy that Su Yang didn’t use her alias, Su Yue, as leverage to tease her until she really died from embarrassment and only teased a few tears out of her.

"Anyway, when did that stupid cat learn to speak so clearly?" Qiuyue looked at Xiao Rong with a frown on her face, her attitude towards her seemingly worse than before.

Xiao Rong also frowned upon being called stupid. Although she didn’t really understand her before, after learning the human language, Xiao Rong finally understood that Qiuyue had been cursing her this entire time.

"Who are you calling a stupid cat, you ugly girl!" Xiao Rong unexpectedly clapped back at Qiuyue, who was shocked by her sudden cursing.

"U-Ugly?!" Qiuyue almost couldn’t believe her ears. This is the first time she’s ever heard someone dared to call her ugly before.

"Y-You are just a cat! Shut up and act like one!"

"Hmph!" Xiao Rong snorted and waved her arms, causing the flying boat to shake viciously, almost like they were suddenly in the middle of the ocean and riding powerful currents.

"W-What are you doing?! Are you trying to destroy my flying treasure?!" Qiuyue exclaimed loudly, her voice filled with panic.

Because Xiao Rong’s cultivation base far exceeded her own, Qiuyue’s control over the flying treasure became unstable.

Su Yang sighed at these two girls. They make him think of fire and water, two different existence that will never cooperate with each other unless some sort of miracle happens.

"Xiao Rong, stop shaking the boat. It’s also making me feel uncomfortable," he said to her.

Although reluctant, Xiao Rong stopped messing with Qiuyue and returned to minding her own business.

Qiuyue glared at Xiao Rong with a displeased expression. No matter how much she wanted to ignore Xiao Rong, there’s just something about Xiao Rong that made her feel unpleasant. Perhaps it was because of Xiao Rong’s overwhelming cultivation base that made her feel uneasy, or maybe she’s just unfamiliar with exotic beasts such as Xiao Rong. Hell, she could simply be jealous of her relationship as Su Yang’s Spiritual Beast since most Spiritual Beasts stay with their Masters until either one of them perishes. Either way, she simply can’t help but dislike her.

"You are not entirely innocent either, Qiuyue." Su Yang switched his attention to her.

"Hmph! It’s that cat’s fault for calling me ugly!" she coldly snorted.

"What are you, a child?" Su Yang shook his head inwardly. It seems like no matter how much she’s matured, there would always be a part of her that will remain childish.

After her little quarrel with Xiao Rong, Qiuyue no longer felt as embarrassed from having her alias revealed to Su Yang. At the end of the day, it was only an alias and nothing more.

However, Su Yang suddenly said to Qiuyue, "About your alias... If you really want to, you can continue using it even in the future."

His words caught her off guard and Qiuyue stared at him with wide eyes that were filled with shock and bewilderment.

"W-What did you just say? S-Say it one more time for me... please..." she asked him, just in case it was just her imagination.

However, Su Yang did not listen to her request and remained silent with a smile on his face. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

"H-He’s still teasing me!" Qiuyue cried inwardly.

And for the remainder of their travel before returning to the Profound Blossom Sect, Qiuyue would try to make Su Yang repeat his words, but alas, Su Yang had closed his eyes and pretended that he couldn’t hear her until they finally reached their destination.
