Chapter 743 A Story of an Immortal Living in a Distant World

"S-Su Yang!" The disciples that had been promoted to sect elder after the Regional Tournament expressed excitement after seeing Su Yang appear before them.

"I’ll take care of this," Su Yang said to them as he flew above the entrance and hovered before tens of thousands of people that gathered in front of the Profound Blossom Sect.

"Look over there! That’s Su Yang!"

"Su Yang?! Did someone just say Su Yang?! Where?!"

"Su Yang! I am from the Xin Family and I have with me—"

"The Xiao Family from the Southern Region would like to have an audience with you—"

"This is the..."

"Su Yang..."

"I am..."

The noises there quickly erupted after someone mentioned the name ’Su Yang’, and everybody there turned to look at the sky.

"Quiet down." Su Yang suddenly spoke in a calm voice, yet it boomed louder than the sound of thunder followed by an intense pressure that filled the atmosphere there, immediately turning the place dead silent.

Once the place was completely silent, Su Yang spoke in a calm voice, "I understand that everyone is here to see me, but I am currently not seeing any guests. However, I will be at the major gathering assembled by the Xie Family to answer any questions that you may all have. Until then, stop gathering around the Profound Blossom Sect like a bunch of rats. It’s bothering my disciples, which bothers me."

"However, if you’re not here for me but something else, you can remain here, and one of our sect elders will be with you shortly. That’s all I have to say."

Without even waiting for any responses, Su Yang returned to the sect and said to the young and inexperienced sect elders, "That should take care of the problems."

"Thank you, Su Yang!" They bowed to him.

Su Yang nodded and continued, "As a small reward for having to deal with this, I will visit you ladies later today."

The sect elders’ expression brightened even more after hearing his words, and they nodded with excitement, "We’ll be waiting for you!"

Once Su Yang left the scene, the sect elders returned to dealing with the guests that came to the Profound Blossom Sect for official business, whilst over 90 percent of the crowd disappeared after Su Yang’s little speech, allowing the sect elders to finally breathe.

Afterward, Su Yang went back to his daily routine and cultivated with the disciples until night, where he would continue to cultivate with his women if they wanted.

Time passed quickly, and a week later, Su Yang left the Profound Blossom Sect to head to the Heavenly Swan Sect to lecture Bai Lihua again.

"Your speed has increased since my last visit. It took you a month to master 20 recipes last time, whilst it took you only a week to master 10 Elementary-grade pills this time," Su Yang praised Bai Lihua after seeing her progress. "At this rate, you’ll master all of the Elementary-grade pills I gave you by next week."

"Thank you, Su Yang. None of this would’ve been possible without you," she said.

Sometime later, Su Yang continued lecturing Bai Lihu, spending an entire day with her before leaving her living quarters.

However, right as Su Yang approached the door and prepared to leave, he suddenly stopped moving, as he noticed Bai Lihua’s fidgeting movements.

Seeing this, Su Yang said with a smile on his face, "Do you want another kiss before I leave?" 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Hearing his words, Bai Lihua’s face flushed with redness, but she nodded her head nevertheless.

Su Yang approached her a moment later before giving Bai Lihua a kiss on the lips.

"Then I’ll see you again next week."

Su Yang waved to her before leaving.

However, instead of leaving the Heavenly Swan Sect and returning straight to the Profound Blossom Sect, Su Yang went to another building inside the Heavenly Swan Sect.

*Knock* *Knock*

Su Yang knocked on the door to this building a moment later.

While he waited for the person to opened the door, Su Yang pondered, ’Although it’s a bit early, I will have to reveal the truth to her sooner or later, and in her case, it would be better for her to learn the truth sooner so that she has sufficient time to think about it.’

The door opened sometime later, and Su Yin appeared before him.

"It really is you, brother! I could smell your scent even before I got close to the door!" Su Yin greeted him with a bright smile, as this is the first time that Su Yang has approached her.

"Hello, Su Yin. Can I come inside?"

"Of course! I would never turn you away!" Su Yin said to him.

Sometime later, once they were inside and seated, Su Yin asked him while sitting right beside him on the couch, "What brings you here, brother? Are you perhaps here about your identity as the Alchemy Master being revealed? If you’re here to apologize for lying to me on that day, then I don’t need it. I understand why you lied to me on that day about your identity."

Su Yang shook his head and said, "No, this has nothing to do with my alias as the Alchemy Master. This is about me... you... it’s about us, and our future."

"It’s about our future...?" Su Yin swallowed nervously after seeing the serious expression on his face.

After a moment of silence, Su Yang said, "There’s something you should know about me, Su Yin. I wanted to tell you this before, but I didn’t want to hurt you, who was overwhelmed with joy that you have reunited with your brother."

"What is it, brother? I can handle it— I promise."

Su Yang nodded and said, "Before I tell you everything, allow me to tell you a little story— a story of an Immortal living in a distant world."

Su Yang proceeded to tell Su Yin about his life as an Immortal in the Divine Heavens and how he experienced reincarnation without explicitly stating that he was the Immortal.
