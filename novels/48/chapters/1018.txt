Chapter 1019: Crafting His Own Dragon

"Here’s 250 high-grade spirit stones." Su Yang placed the money on the desk without hesitation, leaving Lin Xinyi and the clerk speechless.

Although the money isn’t anything ground breaking, it was definitely a lot of money for an outer court disciple.

Seeing Lin Xinyi’s funny expression, Su Yang smiled and said, "I owned a massage parlor before, and it became somewhat popular."

"Why are you buying so much medicine? Are you also an Alchemist?" Lin Xinyi asked out of curiosity.

"I indeed do alchemy once in a while for fun, but it’s not anything amazing."

Even though Su Yang said that, Lin Xinyi couldn’t help but be impressed by his unusual and profound background.

Sometime later, the clerk returned with all of the medicine, and she asked him, "Do you need any storage rings to carry these medicines?"

"I have my own, thank you." Su Yang sucked all of the medicine on the desk into his storage ring.

He turned to Lin Xinyi and said afterward, "Let’s go and get your treasure now."

"Okay." She nodded and followed him to an underground floor, where they sold all sorts of materials.

"Go look around and see what type of materials you want your treasure to be made out of." Su Yang said to her.

"Are you sure? Aren’t you the expert here?" She asked him. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

"The material doesn’t really matter since they are mostly for appearances. However, if you prefer something smoother and easier to ’use’, I’d recommend using jade, since they are the silkiest in terms of texture."

"Then I will pick jade," she said.

"The jade section is over there. Let me know when you’re done. I am also going to look around." Su Yang said, as he suddenly had an idea.

’If the replicas are too expensive for outer court disciples, I can simply make them and sell them to outer court disciples at a much cheaper price. This way, I can acquire not only pleasure points but also reputation...’

A smile appeared on Su Yang’s face as he thought of this brilliant plan.

Thus, he began looking around the store, buying many types of materials.

Once Lin Xinyi decided on what kind of material she wanted her toy to be made of, she bought it and gave it to Su Yang.

"Crystal jade, huh? They’re extremely fragile, so you cannot be too rough with them. Are you sure?" Su Yang asked her.

"I-I am not going to use it, so it’s fine!" She quickly said.

"Right." Su Yang chuckled.

Crystal jade has a jade-like texture, but they’re translucent and much more fragile, so they’re mostly used for decorations, not toys for pleasure.

Now that they had everything they came for, Su Yang and Lin Xinyi quickly left the store.

"Do you want to watch me craft your treasure? It won’t take long, only a few minutes." Su Yang asked her as they walked outside.

"I would like to watch if you don’t mind."

Su Yang nodded, and he said, "This is something I must do while sitting, and I prefer doing it privately. Do you want to do it at my residence, or should I go to yours?"

After her initial surprise, she said, "W-We can do it at your place..."

"Alright. Follow me."

Su Yang then brought her to his residence in the outcast area.

"You live here...?" Lin Xinyi was surprised to learn that he was living in this place.

"Yes. Although there are bad rumors surrounding this place, I actually like it here. It’s nice and quiet, and I don’t have many neighbors." Su Yang said.

Once they reached Su Yang’s doorstep, Lin Xinyi’s nervousness started showing on her face.

Seeing this, Su Yang showed her a calming smile andsaid, "Don’t worry, I won’t do anything weird to you, and we won’t be alone. My servants are also inside."

"Sorry, I don’t mean to..." Lin Xinyi realized that she has been apologizing to him a lot recently for some reason.

"I don’t mind. It’s only natural for a beautiful lady such as yourself to be wary in this sort of environment. Please, come inside."

Lin Xinyi swallowed her nervousness and entered his residence.

"Welcome back, Manager-" Mei Ying greeted them at the door, but she was surprised to see that he wasn’t alone and had even brought back a beautiful young lady.

Lin Xinyi was also surprised to see such a beautiful woman in his house. "Hey, I am about to make some fun toys. Wanna watch?" Su Yang asked Mei Ying.

"Toys?" Mei Ying raised her eyebrows in a questioning manner.

However, she was curious about what he was making, so she nodded her head in the end.

Su Yang sat down in front of a table in the living room and placed the crystal jade purchased by Lin Xinyi onto the table.

"Can you get me a kitchen knife?" Su Yang asked Mei Ying.

"Okay."

Mei Ying returned a moment later with the knife and handed it to him.

"Thank you."

"You’re going to use a kitchen knife to craft the treasure...?" Lin Xinyi held a look of disbelief on her face, and she began wondering if she’d wasted her money buying the crystal jade.

"Just watch." Su Yang said with a smile.

A moment later, Lin Xinyi could feel a sharp aura suddenly enveloping the kitchen knife.

"T-That’s... Sword Qi? You’re also a Swordmaster?" Lin Xinyi couldn’t believe it.

’How old is he? He doesn’t look any older than me, yet he’s already learned alchemy and sword qi. This Xiao Yang... he’s more than meets the eyes.’ She thought to herself.

Su Yang began carving the crystal jade once he was ready, and the ladies in the room watched as he slowly turned the crystal jade that looked not much different than a chuck of rock into something with elegance and grace.

’Eh? He’s crafting... a penis?’ Mei Ying was dumbfounded when she realized what Su Yang was making, but what surprised her the most was how much the sex toy resembled his own dragon.
