Chapter 715 - Xie Xingfang's Recovery

"Xing’er... How is she doing? What about her condition?" Lord Xie finally spoke after many minutes of silently sitting in his bed with a dazed expression.

"Su Yang should be treating her right now. We can only wait here while they do their thing." Xie Wang said.

Lord Xie turned silent again for a few more minutes before he spoke, "Su Yang... Do you think he’ll stay here and take my place in the future if I begged him?"

"What do you think?" Xie Wang shook his head, and he continued, "I think we both know the answer to that question."

"Haaa..." Lord Xie sighed, and he turned to look at the ceiling.

"Looks like I will have to find another heir. However, in order to do that, I will have to find another wife..." Lord Xie sighed again afterward.

"That’s why I told you to find another partner when your previous wife passed in that accident, as things like this can happen." Xie Wang shook his head.

"But you also only had one child! Me!" Lord Xie then said.

"Well, I didn’t have a daughter, nor is there someone like Su Yang running around during my generation." Xie Wang shrugged. He cannot imagine having to deal with Su Yang when he still sat on the throne.

"Whatever..." Lord Xie shook his head before getting out of the bed.

"Where are you going now?"

"I’m going to look for another partner!" Lord Xie said.

"Now?" Xie Wang looked at him with raised eyebrows, and he continued, "With Su Yang still here? If I were you, I would wait until he leaves this world before you bring another woman into this household. Who knows what might happen with Su Yang here."

"..."

Lord Xie nearly tripped on empty air after hearing Xie Wang’s words. However, after pondering about Xie Wang’s words, Lord Xie found Xie Wang’s words quite logical and decided that it would be safer to wait until Su Yang left this world.

Meanwhile, in the Celestial Pond, Su Yang tossed the second poison pill into the water, causing the greyish water to become even darker and grimmer.

About ten hours later, Su Yang tossed another poison pill into the water.

He continued this action until all of the poison pills were dumped into the water.

Once all of the pills had gone into the water, Su Yang began pouring the bottles of liquid into the Celestial Pond, turning the already black water even darker— until it resembled the night sky.

Meanwhile, Xie Xingfang could feel her body heating up more and more as time passed until she was feeling no different than taking a steaming hot bath without the clean water and the steam.

"If you are feeling a sensation that means the treatment is working. It may hurt a bit but you need to endure it," Su Yang said to her after noticing that she was struggling.

Xie Xingfang nodded with her eyes closed. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Many hours later, Su Yang poured the final bottle of liquid into the Celestial Pond.

The instant this liquid touched the pitch-black water, as though a miracle had happened, the black water instantly cleared up, becoming nearly transparent.

Su Yang looked at Xie Xingfang’s beautiful body through the transparent water, yet there was not a single hint of l.u.s.t in his gaze.

A few more minutes later, blood began seeping through Xie Xingfang’s body, dying the transparent blood red.

Once the Celestial Pond had turned completely bloody, the water began to boil, causing Xie Xingfang’s body to sweat like crazy.

Seeing this, Su Yang retrieved a medical herb from his storage ring and tossed it into the boiling water, quickly calming it down within a few seconds.

A few more hours later, Su Yang spoke out loud, "Xing’er, you can stop cultivating now."

Xie Xingfang opened her eyes after hearing his voice, and she turned to look at him, "Am I...?"

Su Yang nodded and said, "Yes, all of the poison within your blood has been ejected from your body. Take a look around you."

It was at this moment Xie Xingfang noticed that she was submerged in bloody water.

Seeing this, Xie Xingfang quickly left the Celestial Pond.

Su Yang handed her a clean towel and said, "Don’t put on your clothes yet."

"Okay...?" Xie Xingfang nodded as she dried her body, wondering what else needed to be done.

Su Yang then waved his sleeves, surrounding the Celestial Pond with Alchemy Flames.

A few minutes later, all of the water in the Celestial Pond evaporated from the intense heat coming from the alchemy flames.

Once the Celestial Pond was empty again, Su Yang retrieved some herbs and tossed them into the Celestial Pond before burning them until black.

"This is..." Xie Xingfang immediately realized what Su Yang was trying to do after witnessing the familiar process. "You’re going to restore the Celestial Pond again?"

"That’s right. And to celebrate your recovery, we’re going to have some fun in it." Su Yang responded with a calm smile on his face.

"Have some fun... in the Celestial Pond?" Xie Xingfang’s eyes widened with surprise after hearing his words.

"You don’t want to?" Su Yang asked her as he continued to restore the Celestial Pond.

"I-I do!" she quickly said.

Su Yang then said, "Once we have some fun alone, I’ll call in the others."

"The others... I understand." Xie Xingfang nodded with a resolute expression on her face, as she has already accepted the fact that she won’t always be alone with him and that it was only natural for one man with many partners to have multiple people on the same bed at once.

Seeing this, Su Yang smiled.

A few minutes later, once the Celestial Pond has been restored for a second time, Su Yang removed his clothes, and he picked up Xie Xingfang like a princess before entering the golden water.

Shortly after entering the Celestial Pond, Su Yang inserted his rod into Xie Xingfang’s cave and began pounding her in the water, creating wave-like ripples in the Celestial Pond.
