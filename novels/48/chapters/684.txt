Chapter 685 Lian Family“s Ancestors

"Now that you know how to concoct the Soul Divination Pill, do you have any questions for me before I leave?" Su Yang asked them.

The sect elders nodded, and Su Yang proceeded to spend another hour answering all of their questions.

Once everything there calmed down, Sect Master Zhu said to Su Yang, "Once again, thank you for this."

Su Yang nodded and then turned to look at the morning sky. The Soul Divination Pill took him nearly the entire day to complete while using their alchemy methods.

"I am going to meet with Emperor Lian now," Su Yang said to Zhu Mengyi and Lian Li.

"You can stay here, and once I return, we will immediately head for the Eastern Continent."

"Okay." Zhu Mengyi nodded.

"Eastern Continent?" Lian Li looked at him with wide eyes. Why are they going there?

"Let’s go," Su Yang said to Lian Li as he flew away and towards the Xie Family’s living quarters.

Sometime later, they arrived at the location, and the Xie Family was already waiting for him outside.

"Su Yang—!"

Just as Xie Wang noticed Su Yang’s approaching figure and opened his mouth to call out to Su Yang, he noticed the peerless beauty following Su Yang, and her beautiful appearance instantly made him speechless.

’Who is that beautiful fairy?! Her appearance rivals even Xing’er!’ Xie Wang cried inwardly.

Even Lord Xie and Xie Xingfang were speechless when they saw the powerful aura surrounding Lian Li.

’A Sovereign Spirit Realm Cultivator! And she looks so young!’ Lord Xie stared at her with a gawking expression.

’What is her relationship with Su Yang? And why do I sense such a familiar feeling coming from her?’ Xie Xingfang thought to herself.

As a fellow princess of an entire continent and a member of the royal family, Xie Xingfang could feel a connection to Lian Li, who also has a similar background.

"Are you all ready to meet Emperor Lian?" Su Yang asked them after descending.

"Yes... but who is that? Is she coming along with us?" Xie Wang couldn’t hold his curiosity and asked. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

"Want to introduce yourself?" Su Yang asked Lian Li.

Lian Li then stepped forward and gave them an elegant and courteous bow, "Hello, my surname is Lian— Lian Li, and I am the eldest daughter of the Lian Family."

"The Lian Family?! Then you’re Emperor Lian’s..." Lord Xie looked at her with wide eyes. No wonder why she had such a familiar aura! She was actually royalty— just like them!

"These guys are from the Eastern Continent, and just like your Lian Family, they— the Xie Family is ruling over the continent."

"Xie Family...? I have heard of the Xie Family, but I never thought I would get the chance to meet you." Lian Li said.

"What? You know of us? How?" Lord Xie asked her with a surprised face.

"Our ancestors, they have been to the Eastern Continent before, and that’s when they met with your ancestors." Lian Li said.

"Really?! How come we don’t have any records of your visit?!" Xie Wang looked at her with clear disbelief on his face.

"I don’t know, but we have records of a Xie Family." Lian Li said.

"Unbelievable... to think our ancestors have met with people from the Holy Central Continent and kept silent about it..." Lord Xie shook his head.

"What if they didn’t know that they’d met with someone from the Holy Central Continent? That could be a possibility." Xie Xingfang said.

"That’s very possible since my ancestors were described as ’lowkey’." Lian Li nodded her head.

"We can all sit down and talk about this after we meet with Emperor Lian," Su Yang said to them.

He then turned to look at Lian Li and asked her, "Where can we find your father?"

"There’s no need for us to fly there; I have a treasure that can directly transport us there." Lian Li said as she retrieved a necklace from her storage ring.

Lian Li brought the necklace closer to her mouth and gave it a gentle kiss.

The necklace then glowed bright red before shattering into tiny particles and forming a portal in front of Lian Li.

"This will teleport us near my home," said Lian Li before she walked into it without hesitation, disappearing into the portal.

Su Yang followed her shortly later, and the Xie Family followed him.

Upon coming out of the portal, they found themselves standing a few meters away from a city.

"This is Pearl City, one of the largest cities on the continent and also where my family is located," Lian Li said after everyone came out of the portal.

As they approached the city, the guards quickly noticed their presence.

"Your Highness!"

Every guard on duty immediately ran to greet them, as did the people that were waiting in line, and they all lowered their heads towards Lian Li.

Lian Li expressed her acknowledgment with a mere nod before ignoring them and entering the city.

Half an hour later, they reached the very center of the city, where another city wall was built, which was used to isolate the Lian Family from the rest of the world despite existing inside one of the largest cities.

"Your Highness!" The guards standing by the gates were surprised when they saw Lian Li’s beautiful figure, as they didn’t receive any news that she would be returning at this time.

"Open the gates. We have visitors," Lian Li said to them.

The guards looked at Su Yang and the Xie Family.

"The Xie Family and Su Yang, right? His Majesty, Emperor Lian is expecting your presence." The guards said to them.

Once the gates were opened, Lian Li led Su Yang and the others to the other side of the walls, and it appeared as though they’d entered another world, as it was a completely different scenery and environment past the gates, looking like they’d actually left the city instead.

"Huh? This is inside the city?" Even Xie Wang was surprised by this sudden change of environment.

"Yes, we are still at the center of the city," Lian Li said, and she continued, "This place was specially made since the Lian Family doesn’t interact with the outside world unless necessary. There are even spiritual beasts and wildlife running around in this space, and this place takes up about 70% of the city. It’s like a small world of its own."
