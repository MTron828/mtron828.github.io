Chapter 951 Noise Complaints

"Y-You useless bitch!" The middle-aged man that sent Su Yang’s first customer to his massage parlor yelled at the woman when she returned to her workplace.

"I sent you to that massage parlor to ruin their reputation, not help their business! Look at what you’ve done! Do you have any idea how loud you were moaning in there?! The entire street could hear it loud and clear!"

Hearing her manager’s words, the woman was shocked. She was moaning that loud? She was too indulged in the pleasure to even realize it!

"I-I’m sorry, manager, but it just felt too good. I have never felt anything like that before," she said to him afterward.

"W-What did you just say?" The manager looked dumbfounded after hearing her words.

"As much as I hate to say this, I think we shouldn’t mess with that massage parlor, manager. I have a feeling that it will become quite big within the City of Pleasure, much less the Pink Light District, and if we offend them, who knows what might happen in the future." The woman said to him.

"I don’t have to hear that bullshit! Get out of my face!" The middle-aged man shouted in an angry voice.

"Excuse me." The woman didn’t show much of a reaction despite the manager’s reaction, clearly used to it.

However, just as she approached the brothel, she could hear an incredibly loud moan come from the massage parlor she’d just left, causing her to turn around with wide eyes.

"Aaaaaaah~!"

The moaning was so loud that it’d startled everyone on the street.

"Heavens! What the heck was that? It sounded even louder than before!"

"Whoever is inside is definitely exaggerating her moaning. There’s no way this is real." Another person said, doubting the legitimacy of the moaning.

"I agree. This is probably some sort of advertisement they’re doing for their massage parlor. I refuse to believe that one could possibly moan so loud without deliberately doing so."

Despite some of the store owners’ doubt, the pedestrians were definitely intrigued by whatever was happening inside the massage parlor.

However, they were not only interested in whatever was happening inside, but they were also afraid as well.

After all, nobody there could fathom the satisfaction this woman was feeling to release such blissful and loud moans.

It could be said that the majority of customers within the City of Pleasure had above average endurance since they were used to pleasure, so in order to make someone feel this good, the massage must be top-notch. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The moaning from the massage parlor continued to resound in the area until almost half an hour later.

A few minutes after the moaning stopped, everyone there could see a woman walking out of the shop with shaky legs that wouldn’t stop even if she was standing still, almost like they were made of tofu or something.

"Ah!"

The young woman fell on the floor after taking a few steps and was unable to stand up again.

The pedestrian was baffled when they saw this, and some of them approached her.

"Are you okay, young lady?" Someone there offered his hand to the woman.

However, the woman shook her head and said, "I am okay. My body is just incredibly sensitive at the moment. I don’t want to be touched. Thank you for your concerns."

Someone else there then asked, "You just got a massage from that place, right? How did it feel? Was it really that incredible? We could hear your moaning even a street away."

"I-I was that loud?" The young woman immediately blushed when she realized that she’d been moaning loud enough for everyone to hear.

When the others saw her genuine bashful reaction, they knew that she wasn’t faking her moaning before.

"Unfortunately, words cannot describe what I felt inside the massage parlor. That young man inside... He’s incredibly talented, and his techniques were simply godlike. I urge everyone to give it a try. You won’t regret it," said the young woman.

Everyone there exchanged glances with each other.

"I-I am going to try it out!" Someone there said after a moment of silence.

She then entered the small building.

As for the young woman, she proceeded to sit in front of the massage parlor until she could finally move again.

A few minutes later, another customer in the massage parlor began moaning, filling the street with blissful moans.

The store owners on the same street were beginning to get annoyed by the constant moaning. Although the sound of moaning was frequent within the City of Pleasure and could be heard on nearly every single street in the city, they weren’t this loud and distracting.

Eventually, one of the store owners there went inside the massage parlor to complain.

"Hey! Can you keep the noises down? Or do you expect us to deal with so much noise every day? If you need someone to make a sound concealment formation for your massage parlor, I can refer you to someone!" One of the store owners there complained to Luo Ziyi.

Luo Ziyi showed an apologetic smile and said, "I’m sorry for the inconvenience. We have already contacted an array master to help reduce the noises, but it will take a few more days before he arrives."

"Che!"

The store owner wanted to continue to complain, but she wasn’t able to find any reason to do so.

"If I still hear so much noise by next week, I will make a formal complaint to the management hall and have them deal with your place!" The store owner said to Luo Ziyi before leaving the place.

"Thank you for your understanding," Luo Ziyi said to her as she left the massage parlor.

As an array master herself, she could make the formation whenever she wanted, but if she did that before their massage parlor got some attention, it would be bad for their business, so they purposefully avoided that until someone made a complaint.

Thus, the customers’ loud moaning continued to terrorize that street for a few more days until Luo Ziyi had to leave the City of Pleasure and return to her sect.
