Chapter 789 - Root of Revival

"Die? You can die if you want but only after you tell me where I can find the ingredient," Su Yang said to the old man.

"Oh, right, I nearly forgot about that matter since I was so absorbed in our exchange. The Root of Revival, an incredibly rare herb that can only be found in extremely harsh environments."

"Yes, and you claimed that you know who has it."

The old man nodded and said, "Indeed, I know who has it. However, before I tell you that, can you tell me your purpose for seeking out this treasure? I have taken a good look at the list, and almost every ingredient on the list was related to rebirth one way or another. Are you trying to resurrect the dead or something similar?"

"Resurrection?" A weird smile appeared on Su Yang’s face, and he continued, "There’s no such thing as resurrecting the dead. Once someone passes, they will remain dead. Perhaps reincarnation may exist, but real resurrection is most definitely impossible."

"Hmm..." The old man looked at Su Yang with a pondering gaze.

Su Yang shrugged and said, "I’m just a man looking for these ingredients so his woman can be happy."

The old man’s eyes widened, and he asked, "A woman? You’re doing all of this for a woman? I’d like to hear more about it if you don’t mind since my interest is now intrigued."

Since it wasn’t anything sensitive or crazy, Su Yang nodded and gave a brief explanation about Su Liqing’s situation and how she cannot conceive his child, hence why he’s going around the world looking for these ingredients.

"My heavens, this is the first time I’ve seen such dedication— traveling around the five continents just so you can i.m.p.r.e.g.n.a.t.e your woman... I truly admire that..."

Su Yang smiled and said a moment later, "Well? Have you heard enough? Do you feel like telling me who has the Root of Revival?"

The old man nodded his head and said, "Yes. I just wanted to make sure that you weren’t trying to do something immoral with the Root of Revival. The Root is Revival is with my family, but they might not be willing to hand it over for free."

"I never expected them to hand it over for free, anyway." Su Yang said.

"Good, then follow me. We’re a little bit far so it might take a few days," said the old man.

"You can give us the directions and we’ll take you with us in this flying treasure; it’ll be much faster than flying normally."

The old man looked at the flying boat and nodded.

Sometime later, the old man boarded the flying treasure with Su Yang and gave him the directions to his living quarters.

"This is it," said the old man as they approached a vast city that was a similar size to Snowfall City where the Xie Family lived.

"Welcome to Immortal City and my Xian Family, fellow Daoist." The old man surnamed Xian said.

"Immortal City? What an overbearing name for a city without a single Immortal— don’t you think so too?" Su Yang suddenly said.

"Hahaha! I know exactly what you mean! However, I was not the one who named it so there’s not much I can say!"

"Anyway, I don’t think I have introduced myself yet. My surname is Xian— Xian Ni."

Sometime later, they descended at the entrance of some large building within Immortal City. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The guards standing by the gates were alerted when they saw the flying treasuring approaching them, but their wariness disappeared the moment they saw Xian Ni’s old face and muscular body.

"Welcome back, Ancestor!" The guards kneeled on the ground and greeted.

"Where are my children?" Xian Ni asked in a slightly cold voice, his atmosphere completely different from the silly old man before.

"They are currently in a meeting with some officials from the Nine Immortal Families," said the guards.

"Nine Immortal Families?" Su Yang shook his head at these people flaunting around the title ’Immortal’ as though it was nothing.

However, this was none of his business and he was only here for the Roof of Revival.

"I see..." Xian Ni nodded, and he led Su Yang and his group into their territory a moment later.

"It’s been over 200 years since I’ve last returned to this place yet it feels almost like I’ve only left recently. I guess this is what it feels like to be an ’Immortal’ right? Of course, I am not claiming to be an Immortal, as that is still too far away."

"Real Immortality is nothing like this," Su Yang shook his head, and he continued, "As an Immortal, it can feel like only a few years have passed since you left your family, but alas, when you return, your family is no longer there and many generations have passed."

"..."

Xian Ni looked at Su Yang with a profound gaze.

’Why does it sound like he’s speaking from experience?’ he wondered inwardly.

Sometime later, they entered the building, and Xian Ni led Su Yang and his small group to the guest room.

"You can relax here for a bit while I speak with my family," Xian Ni said to them. "I’ll have someone bring the tea and snacks in a bit."

"Take your time," Su Yang said as he casually laid on the couch like a lazy bum, leaving Xian Ni speechless, as he’s never had such relaxed guests before.

Once Xian Ni left Su Yang in the guest room, he went to find the nearest servants and told them to serve their best snacks and tea to the guests.

However, the servants were puzzled by Xian Ni’s presence because it’s been over 200 years since he last visited the place, and most of the servants working there now have never seen Xian Ni before. Of course, once Xian Ni showed them his authority token, the servants immediately recognized his revered identity and kowtowed on the floor, apologizing to him for not recognizing him.
