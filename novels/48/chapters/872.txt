After saying their goodbyes to the disciples, Su Yang’s family boarded the large flying treasure in the sky with Su Yang being the last person to board.

"Although I will be leaving, this might not be the last time you’ll see me, as I will try my best to return in the future." Su Yang said to the disciples, causing the noises to increase tremendously.

He then turned to look at Liu Lanzhi and held her hands, "I will be back for you and our child— I promise."

Liu Lanzhi nodded with a gentle smile on her face, "We will be waiting for you."

Su Yang then grabbed Liu Lanzhi and pulled her body into his embrace before giving her a long and passionate kiss before all of the disciples.

The place immediately became dead silent, as the disciples didn’t want to ruin their mood.

A good moment later, Su Yang released her and flew away, broadening the flying treasure.

"Goodbye, Su Yang! Goodbye, everyone!" Liu Lanzhi watched as the flying treasure disappeared from the Profound Blossom Sect with tears flowing down her face.

The disciples and Liu Lanzhi remained still for a few minutes even after Su Yang left the place.

Liu Lanzhi wiped her tears and turned to face the disciples with a smile and motivated expression on her face.

"You can return to whatever you were doing," she said to them.

Once the disciples were dismissed, Liu Lanzhi returned to the Yin Yang Pavilion that felt uncomfortably quiet.

"He’s only been gone for a few minutes and I am already feeling miserable and lonely. Life isn’t going to be as easy as I thought." Liu Lanzhi sighed.

She proceeded to go back to work, hoping that it’d take her mind off Su Yang’s departure, but it was quickly made apparent that she was unable to focus on anything.

Thus, she could only lie on the bed that still lingered with Su Yang’s smell and closed her eyes to recall all of her experience with Su Yang.

The first time they met. Su Yang’s Inner Court disciple examination. Everything from the day the Su Family dropped him off at the Profound Blossom Sect.

"The Sect Master is really staying behind, huh?" The ladies on the flying treasure admired Liu Lanzhi’s will to stay behind whilst everyone else left.

A few moments after leaving the Profound Blossom Sect, the flying treasure headed to the City of Yuan to pick up Sun Jingjing from her parents before heading to the Southern Continent to meet up with Qiuyue.

"Goodbye, Jingjing. Goodbye, Su Yang. Stay safe out there!" Sun Jingjing’s parents watched them leave the city with teary eyes.

After picking up Sun Jingjing, they went straight to the Southern Continent.

"It feels like it’s been forever since I left this place..." Qin Liangyu stared at the Southern Continent from above with a nostalgic feeling.

"Do you want to visit the Boar Tribe before leaving?" Su Yang asked her.

"Can I?"

"Yes. We still have a few days before we leave this world, and we’ll have a few hours even after the treasure appears." Su Yang nodded.

"Okay. I will visit the Boar Tribe one last time before I leave." Qin Liangyu said.

"Wow... So this is the Southern Continent, huh? It’s nothing like I had expected." Sun Jingjing mumbled in a low voice.

Sometime later, Su Yang brought Qin Liangyu back to the Boar Tribe whilst the others stayed with Qiuyue on the flying ship.

"C-Chief Qin?!"

The tribe members were surprised to see Qin Liangyu suddenly return to their place with Su Yang.

"What are you talking about? I am no longer the chief of this place." Qin Liangyu said with a smile on her face.

"Oh... right... I said that without thinking... Anyways, what are you doing back here, Senior Qin? Don’t tell me you’re returning to us?!" The tribe members said.

"Of course, not. I am only here to visit you guys one last time before I leave this world through the mirror." Qin Liangyu said to them.

"The Mirror of Darkness? You’re really going through it? Nobody really knows what’s on the other side either."

Qin Liangyu nodded, and she continued, "Is Lebao here? Ah, I meant Chief Lebao. How’s he doing?"

"Yes, Chief Lebao is doing great as the new chief. He also recently had a child."

"Really? That’s great to hear." Qin Liangyu said, feeling relieved that he was able to move forward.

"Do you want me to call the Chief here?" The tribe members at the entrance asked her.

"I don’t want to bother his new family, so this is the furthest I will go." Qin Liangyu shook her head, as she didn’t want her presence to make things awkward for his new family.

"Who do you think you’re going to bother?"

A familiar voice suddenly resounded in the distance, causing everybody there to turn and look.

To their surprise, Chief Lebao was standing there with a little boy in his arms and a pretty woman beside him.

They slowly approached Qin Liangyu.

"You won’t be a bother. I have already gotten over it." Lebao said to her with a calm smile on his face.

"You’re here to see whether I am leading the tribe properly or not, right? Come with me. I’ll show you around." Lebao then said with a confident smile on his face.

"That’s not my intention. I am just here visiting the place I grew up in for the last time." Qin Liangyu said.

"The last time?" Leobao raised his eyebrows.

"I am leaving this world with Su Yang. We’re going to go through the Mirror of Darkness," she revealed to him.

"W-What? The Mirror of Darkness?" Lebao was shocked.

"You’re actually going to do it? You know many people have gone inside and never returned."

"I know." Qin Liangyu nodded.

"And you’re going to risk it? For him?" Lebao turned to look at Su Yang, who was casually standing there like he was minding his own business.
