Chapter 656 - Holy Sword Academy

"..."

After a moment of silence, Sect Master Zhu spoke in a low voice, "When? When are you going to leave this place?"

"I will leave with Su Yang when he returns to the Eastern Continent," Zhu Mengyi responded.

"Aiya!" Sect Master Zhu suddenly released a loud sigh while rubbing her temples in a stressed manner.

"I just became a grandmother, and you’re already going to take Zhu Jiayi away from me before she can even understand who I am? Are you sure you aren’t doing this just to screw with me because of how I treated you in the past? This should be criminal."

"I know this isn’t fair to you, mother, but I am definitely not doing this on purpose! I thought I would be fine without Su Yang, but I quickly realized my naivety after he left. Now that he has returned and even offered me to follow him, I simply cannot say no, and even Zhu Jiayi seems to really like him. I don’t want her to grow up without a father."

"..."

Sect Master Zhu silently stared at the beautiful little girl sleeping in Zhu Mengyi’s arms, feeling a perplexing emotion in her heart. As much as she wanted Zhu Mengyi and Zhu Jiayi to stay in the sect, she couldn’t possibly deny Zhu Mengyi of a partner and Zhu Jiayi of a father no matter how selfish she was.

"As long as you promise me that you will visit me with Zhu Jiayi once in a while, I will stop complaining," Sect Master Zhu spoke after a long moment of silence.

However, Zhu Mengyi did not respond to her and merely remained silent.

Seeing this, Sect Master Zhu frowned, "What? Are you telling me that you are not willing to visit me after you leave? And you dare say that you aren’t trying to screw with me!?"

Sect Master Zhu wanted to slam the desk in anger, but she didn’t dare to scare the sleeping Zhu Jiayi.

"It’s not that I don’t want to visit you, mother. It’s a complicated situation..." Zhu Mengyi sighed.

If she follows Su Yang back to his own world, it might be incredibly difficult if not outright impossible to return to this world, hence why she cannot make that promise with her mother.

"Complicated? What’s so complicated about this? If Su Yang can travel the Jade Sea and come here from the Eastern Continent, why can’t you visit me?" she asked.

"You don’t understand at all, mother. When I leave with Su Yang, I am not just traveling to another continent..." Zhu Mengyi shook her head.

As much as she wanted to tell her mother about Su Yang’s real identity, she didn’t dare to reveal his Immortal background without his permission even if it was her own mother asking.

"If you can’t promise me that you’ll visit me, let me speak with Su Yang! I’m sure that he’ll let me see my granddaughter!" her mother then said.

"Su Yang just left the sect with Wu Jingjing to travel to the Holy Sword Academy," Zhu Mengyi said to her. "Wu Jingjing wants Su Yang to meet with her father, Senior Wu..."

��Then we’ll continue this conversation once he returns. You should leave before I wake up the baby," Sect Master Zhu said, clearly upset about Zhu Mengyi’s decision to leave the sect without telling her everything.

Zhu Mengyi sighed, "I understand... I will return with Su Yang later..."

Meanwhile, 200,000 miles away from the Four Seasons Academy, Su Yang and Wu Jingjing have just arrived at the Holy Sword Sect.

"This is..." Su Yang stared at the statue of a handsome young man standing in a heroic pose with a thick sword on his back that was placed right in front of the sect entrance. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

"That is my father during his prime, Wu Jiang, who is also known as the Sword Saint." Wu Jingjing explained to him.

"Sword Saint, huh?" Su Yang shook his head inwardly. If the Sword Saints in the Divine Heaven were to learn that someone at the Sovereign Spirit Realm dared to claim the title of Sword Saint, the Holy Sword Academy would disappear within 24 hours.

"Come on, let’s go meet my father," she grabbed Su Yang’s hand and pulled him towards the sect entrance while he carried Wu Min with his other arm.

"S-Senior apprentice-sister!"

The disciples guarding the entrance immediately bowed to her.

They then turned to look at Su Yang with a dazed face, as they were unfamiliar with his face. However, what shocked them the most was the fact that he was carrying Wu Min. Just who is this handsome young man? If Wu Jingjing trusted him enough to let him carry Wu Min, then he must be someone fairly important to her! Hell, he was even holding onto Wu Jingjing’s hands!

"Senior apprentice-sister, this young man is...?" One of the disciples decided to ask her.

"He’s here as my guest," she quickly responded.

"What I mean is—"

Before that disciple could even finish his sentence, Wu Jingjing narrowed her eyes at him and spoke with a frown on her face, "When did it become your job to question my relationsh.i.p.s?"

"T-There must have been a misunderstanding! I wouldn’t dare to..." The disciple quickly apologized.

"..."

Seeing this, Wu Jingjing spoke in a cold voice, "I know what you’re doing. Tell that person to stay away from us, or he’ll regret it."

"..."

That disciple’s entire body immediately stiffened after hearing her words.

However, before he could even respond, Wu Jingjing pulled Su Yang into the sect and walked away without looking back.

Once they were gone, the disciples there mumbled to each other, "If I had to guess, that young man is definitely her lover..."

"Yeah... And he’s most likely also the one who i.m.p.r.e.g.n.a.t.ed Senior apprentice-sister Wu..."

"Haaa... that person isn’t going to be happy about this..."

"Whether he’ll be happy or not is none of our concerns. Our job is to report our findings to him, and this is something we must report even at the cost of our lives."

"Then who wants to be the one to report to him about the situation?"

"..."

The place immediately turned silent.
