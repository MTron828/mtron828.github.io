Chapter 859 - Hong Yu'er's Ambition

"Yes, Hong Yu’er was the one who allowed Lingxi to take over her body. I wonder what she wants from me after disappearing for so long." Su Yang mumbled, as he hasn’t seen or heard from Hong Yu’er ever since Tang Linxgi returned to her own body.

"Let me see what she wants from me. I’ll be back." Su Yang got off the bed before putting on his clothes.

"See you later." Lian Li said to him.

Su Yang left the Yin Yang Pavilion sometime later and went to meet Hong Yu’er, who was waiting in the guest hall.

Inside the guest room, Hong Yu’er turned around after hearing the door open.

"It’s been a while, Hong Yu’er." Su Yang said to her, and he continued, "To come all the way here, it must be fairly important, right? Let me hear it."

Hong Yu’er stared at Su Yang’s handsome face in silence for a moment before speaking in a calm voice, "I will get straight to the point, Su Yang. I want you to take me to the Divine Heavens."

"..."

Su Yang did not immediately respond to her surprising request. After a moment of silence, he opened his mouth and spoke a single word, "Why?"

"Because I can no longer find any interest in this world. No matter what I do, my mind is filled with the memories Senior Tang left behind for me. That vast Divine Heaven and all of its wonders... I want to experience it for myself." Hong Yu’er replied.

"You want to experience the Divine Heavens? I’m sorry, but that’s impossible for you." Su Yang quickly said, dumbfounding her.

"W-What do you mean it’s impossible?! Or do you mean you’re not willing to take me to the Divine Heavens with you because I am not your woman?! If that’s the case, I’ll become your woman! I’ll let you do whatever you want with my body!" Hong Yu’er spoke in a sincere voice.

Su Yang shook his head and said, "You should know that it has nothing to do with our relationship. As for why I say it’s impossible... You’re simply not qualified— not with your talents."

"The only reason you’ve managed to reach the Heavenly Spirit Realm is because of Tang Lingxi’s assistance. If you go to the Divine Heavens, you’ll die."

Hearing Su Yang’s words that were spoken in a serious tone, Hong Yu’er bit her lips in frustration, and she said, "I am fine with that! Even if I die, I want to go to the Divine Heavens! If you won’t take me, I’ll go there by myself! I know there’s a mirror in the Southern Continent that leads to the Divine Heavens! And with the teleportation formation now available, I can simply teleport to the Southern Continent and go to the Divine Heavens!"

Seeing Hong Yu’er’s desperation, Su Yang sighed, "Hong Yu’er... You want to go to the Divine Heavens because you want to see Tang Lingxi... Am I correct?"

Hong Yu’er’s body trembled slightly after hearing Su Yang’s words.

"Why do you want to see her? The two of you live in two completely different worlds."

"I... I want to thank her." Hong Yu’er mumbled in a mosquito-like voice.

"Thank her? You’re willing to risk your life just to thank her? For what? For helping you reach the Heavenly Spirit Realm?"

"No! You have no idea what it was like for me when Senior Tang took over my body! She not only broadened my view! She was also my friend! We spoke about a lot of things! She told me about the Four Divine Heavens, the powerful Immortals in that world, how much she loves you— a lot of things! And I have never had a friend like Senior Tang before." Hong Yu’er shouted.

And she continued, "The Hong Family sold me to the Su Family— to you! However, after your disappearance, they handed me over to Su Yuhan, treating me like some kind of disposable thing!"

"I felt weak! Powerless! Hopeless! I had given up on my own life! However, Senior Tang’s appearance changed all of that! She challenged the Hong Family! She refused to be treated with disrespect! She was powerful enough to pick her own path! She was the complete opposite of me, and I admired her for that!"

"That’s why I want to meet Senior Tang again! I want to help her! I want to serve someone like her!" Hong Yu’er revealed the real reason why she wanted to go to the Four Divine Heavens with him. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

"..."

Su Yang was left speechless by Hong Yu’er’s outburst. He could’ve never imagined how much Hong Yu’er respected Tang Lingxi or how Tang Lingxi’s presence affected her life. It was truly a shocking revelation.

"You want to serve Lingxi?" Su Yang asked her for confirmation.

"Yes!" Hong Yu’er immediately responded without any hesitation.

"What if she refuses to accept you as a servant? What will you do then? Because as far as I’m aware, Lingxi doesn’t have any servants, and this is her own choice." Su Yang said to her.

"I won’t know unless I ask her! Even if she refuses, I won’t give up just like you didn’t give up on her despite being rejected countless times! And I am going to chase her until she accepts me as a servant or until I die!" Hong Yu’er said with a resolute expression on her face.

"How ambitious and devoted... Are you sure you want to spend the rest of your life like that?" Su Yang asked her.

And he continued, "You could spend the rest of your life as a servant... or you can live freely in this world— in the life that Lingxi had set up for you."

"In this world, you’re powerful and famous. You can do almost anything you want in your current status. However, once you go to the Four Divine Heavens, you’ll return to being powerless and a nobody."

"I will ask you again— Are you really okay with leaving this world and everything behind for such an uncertain future?" Su Yang stared at her with narrowed eyes.
