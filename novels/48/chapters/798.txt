Chapter 799 - A Few Minutes to Prepare

A few minutes have passed since Su Yang gave the Patriarchs another suggestion, yet they haven’t come to a conclusion yet.

"I have a very bad feeling about this, and I cannot shake this ominous feeling no matter how much I try..."

"First he suggests 24 hours, then he suggests 1 hour... The difference is too vast. What on earth is he thinking?"

"I have no idea, but does it really matter? All remaining participants will have 24 hours to defeat him. Whatever he does, it won’t change that fact!"

After speaking to each other for a couple more minutes, they returned their attention to Su Yang, and they said to him.

"Very well. As long as the rules remain the same, we will agree with your methods. Since the tournament is already beyond normal, it won’t make any difference if we change things around."

Su Yang nodded and then asked, "Can I get a few minutes to prepare myself?"

"Go ahead! Try not to take too long, though!"

"It will only be a few minutes," Su Yang said with a mysterious smile on his face that gave an ominous feeling to the Patriarchs.

After turning around, Su Yang suddenly lifted his arm into the air with his index finger glowing a small but bright golden light, creating a beautiful line in the air wherever his fingers moved.

He continued to move his fingers through the air, almost like he was using it as a brush and writing something in the air.

A few seconds later, a majestic symbol that emitted a profound aura floated in the air, shocking the audience and the nine Immortal Families’ Patriarchs.

"T-That... Is that what I think it is?!" One of them exclaimed.

"W-What the heck? That looks like array symbols no matter how I look at it."

"That is array symbols! Why is he creating them? Does he intend on making a formation now?"

"Hahaha! I can’t believe it! Does he really plan on making a formation in just a few minutes?!"

"Even the best Array Masters in the Western Continent require many weeks just to set up the most basic formation! Even if the Eastern Continent is more advanced in arrays, I highly doubt the difference is this vast, where they can do it in mere minutes!"

Xian Ni stared at the majestic symbols floating in the air with his jaw dropped, as he had never seen such clean and flawless symbols before.

While he is not an Array Master, he has dabbled in formations for a few years, so he has some knowledge in that aspect— enough to tell what Su Yang had done just now was incredibly ridiculous.

’He’d created such a flawless and powerful symbol in just a few seconds! That’s impossible! It would take even the best Array Masters in this place an entire week to draw one of those and it would still not come out with such perfection!’ Xian Ni cried inwardly, feeling a little numb from the shock.

Meanwhile, the nine Patriarchs that was unaware of Su Yang’s brilliance laughed at his foolishness.

"Even if he can create a formation within just a few minutes, there’s no way such a rushed formation would have any effect!"

"Such a fragile formation will collapse with just the wind blowing on it!"

A few minutes later, over a hundred golden symbols floated around Su Yang, emitting an otherworldly aura.

"Form!"

Su Yang suddenly poked one of these symbols, and all one hundred symbols began trembling before connecting with each other, forming a translucent box around Su Yang.

Once the formation was finished, Su Yang turned to look at the Patriarchs and said, "Okay, I am prepared. The rules never mentioned anything about formations so I’ll assume it’s allowed. There shouldn’t be any problems, right?" ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

"Yes, you’re right. There is no such rule that forbids the usage of formations, mostly because we never imagined that someone would have enough time to create a formation in the middle of a tournament." One of the Patriarchs said to him.

Su Yang nodded, and then he turned to look at the participants and said to them, "You now all have 24 hours to break this formation..."

Su Yang suddenly paused in the middle of his sentence.

A few seconds later, he continued, "Actually, let’s do this instead. If even a single one of you can create a crack in this formation— no matter how small— I will personally forfeit this tournament and not only give the Nine Immortal Families their Immortal-grade cultivation techniques but also one million spirit stones to every participant in this tournament!"

"WHAT?!"

Everybody there exclaimed in a shocked voice, and they all stared at Su Yang with gawking looks on their faces.

If someone manages to break the formation, Su Yang would have to shell out an astronomical amount of wealth, and since there are about ten thousand participants, it would mean over ten billion spirit stones!

Is it even possible for a single man to have such wealth in this world?

"There’s no way you have that much money! Your words are merely empty promises!" One of the participants there pointed at him and shouted.

Su Yang then looked at that participant and said, "You should worry about whether you can break the formation or not before you start worrying about the money."

The young man coldly snorted in disdain and said, "Then watch me break this formation effortlessly! There’s no way you can create a powerful formation in such a short time!"

After his sentence ended, the young man pounced at Su Yang and slashed the formation with his Spirit-grade sword.

"Break for me!"

The young man shouted, expecting the formation to crumble the moment his sword touches it.

However, to his surprise, the formation not only didn’t collapse, it even deflected his sword, sending it flying out of his hand and landing somewhere in the audience, almost hitting someone with it.

Luckily for that individual who almost got it, Xian Ni caught the sword with his spiritual energy before it caused an accident.

"What?! That’s impossible!" The young man stared at Su Yang’s perfectly healthy formation with a shocked look on his face.
