Chapter 899 - Luo Ziyi

"This place is developing pretty nicely. Although it looks simple on the outside, it’s actually the complete opposite inside." Mu Yuechan praised their sect after seeing the structures and the disciples inside.

Every single building in this place appeared to have a powerful formation protecting it alongside other formations that increased the quality of Profound Qi in the air.

All of the disciples they have encountered thus far also looked happy and content with their lifestyle. It was a rare sight for sects within the Divine Heavens to look so calm and peaceful, as the disciples normally see each other as competitors and are stressed by trying to gain recognition by the sect.

"Good morning, Elder Sister Wang." The disciples within the sect greeted Wang Yunxuan as though they were an actual family.

"Morning, Junior Sister Ling." Wang Yunxuan greeted the disciples back in a similar fashion.

"Hey, Wang Yunxuan, I have a question for you." Mu Yuechan suddenly said.

"What is it?"

"Do you know a fatty by the name of Xiao Yang?" Mu Yuechan asked.

"A fatty? I don’t know any fatties— at least I’m not familiar with any of them," she quickly responded.

Fat people were incredibly rare in the cultivation world— even rarer than ugly people since increasing one’s cultivation also enhances their fitness and beauty, and a cultivator has near-perfect control over their own body, allowing them to get rid of the fat in their body without exercising. The only reason someone would remain fat in the cultivation world is by choice or they’re inflicted with some sort of illness that causes them to be fat.

"You don’t? That fatty seemed very familiar with the Su Family. In fact, he even asked about you guys." Mu Yuechan revealed this to her.

Wang Yunxuan stopped walking and turned to look at her with narrowed eyes, "What did this fatty want to know about my family?"

"Don’t worry, it wasn’t anything malicious— at least I didn’t feel any coming from him. In fact, he even appeared somewhat concerned about the Su Family. He claimed to be Su Yang’s descendant at first, but he was clearly lying."

"Su Yang’s descendant? As if. Su Yang was a man who refused to i.m.p.r.e.g.n.a.t.e even his own family. I have tried... plenty of times, but he would always refuse." Wang Yunxuan sighed with a regretful look on her face.

If they had a child with Su Yang, perhaps they wouldn’t be as lonely.

"I thought so as well." Mu Yuechan said.

"Anyways, what did that fatty ask about my family?" Wang Yunxuan asked again.

"Nothing much besides about the family’s current state and about that incident two thousand years ago," she said.

"And what did you tell him?"

"What I knew."

"You!" Wang Yunxuan was clearly unhappy about Mu Yuechan’s decision to give away their information to some stranger.

"Calm down. I already told you that he didn’t look like a bad guy, and he had an irresistible offer for me, so I had to agree." Mu Yuechan shrugged casually.

"Irresistible offer?" Wang Yunxuan raised her eyebrows.

The only information Mu Yuechan would consider as ’irresistible’ would be information about Su Yang.

Mu Yuechan smiled and said, "That’s right. He gave me information about Su Yang that I never knew about, and it would surely shock you if you also knew about it."

"What? How is that possible? There’s no way some stranger would know more about Su Yang than you. How can you be so sure that the information was real?" Wang Yunxuan clearly doubted the information’s legitimacy.

"He used a Soul Validity Scroll. If he lied, he would’ve died on the spot."

Wang Yunxuan frowned even more after hearing this, and she began growing interest in this mysterious fatty.

"Anyway, maybe we’ll learn more about him from Luo Ziyi."

"You said that you have a message to pass to her, right? Is this message from this fatty?"

"Yes, it’s from him."

"..."

"Luo Ziyi lives in this small place? How surprising." Mu Yuechan said.

Wang Yunxuan then said, "You have no idea how much this place means to Sister Ziyi. This hill... It was actually relocated from the Jade Heaven to this place."

"Huh? You’re saying that she’d moved an entire hill to this place? Why?"

"You don’t know? How surprising." Wang Yunxuan said with a smile.

"Even I don’t know everything, alright?" Mu Yuechan quickly said.

"If you want to know, you can ask her yourself."

Wang Yunxuan then approached the building on the peak of the hill.

"Sister Ziyi, you have a guest!"

A few moments later, the door to the building opened, and a woman with a graceful yet cold appearance appeared.

"I don’t remember setting any appointments," said Luo Ziyi.

Then she noticed Mu Yuechan.

"Mu Yuechan? What are you doing here?"

"I am here to pass on a message to you," she said. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

"A message? From whom? You’re the last person I’d expect to deliver a message for someone."

"I know, it’s kind of complicated. Anyways, it’s from a fatty named Xiao Yang. Do you know him?"

"A fatty?" Luo Ziyi raised her slender eyebrows.

"I don’t know of any fatty named Xiao Yang. What kind of message does he have for me?"

Mu Yuechan then cleared her throat before speaking in a clear voice, "I will see you at the Frozen Azure Cave in three months when the Azure Lotus blooms."

"..."

Luo Ziyi’s eyes widened with shock after hearing Mu Yuechan’s words, and she even took a few steps back in an unbalanced manner, looking like she was drunk.

"Sister Ziyi? What’s going on? What does this message mean? The last time the Azure Lotus was harvested was 6,000 years ago, so it shouldn’t bloom for another 4 thousand years according to my knowledge." Wang Yunxuan asked her, feeling a little baffled by Luo Ziyi’s reaction.
