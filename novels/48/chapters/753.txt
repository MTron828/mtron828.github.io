Chapter 754 Tang Lingxi“s Departure

Once Su Yang and Tang Lingxi were on the top of this unknown mountain, the two of them sat on the edge of some cliff and began speaking to each other casually like they were great friends with some intimate feelings for each other.

"I think my impressions of cliffs have been greatly affected by the Eternal Retribution Cliff," Su Yang said with a bittersweet smile on his face.

"Eternal Retribution Cliff... you know you could’ve left that place whenever you wanted if you truly tried," Tang Lingxi said to him, and she continued, "Why did you decide to stay inside? That’s what I don’t understand."

"Of course I could’ve left that place, but what about the outcome afterward? The Heavenly Emperor will chase me until the end of the universe if I left without his permission, and I didn’t want an all-out war with ’her’ father, nor did I want to go against ’her’ family," Su Yang said with a sighing voice.

"So I prepared myself to stay inside for a few thousand years until the Heavenly Emperor eventually calms down and let me leave. But alas, that old man came out of the blue and reincarnated me into this world without any explanation. I don’t know whether I should thank him or curse him..." Su Yang shook his head with a bitter smile.

"Though, one thing is for sure— the Heavenly Emperor will definitely think that I’ve escaped the Eternal Retribution Cliff if he realizes that I am still alive, and I cannot risk that until I’ve become strong enough. Therefore, don’t expect me to announce my return to the world until I am sufficient in power once again."

"If the Heavenly Emperor tries to do anything funny to you, I won’t just sit back and do nothing this time, Su Yang, because I am not going to lose you again even if I have to announce to the world our relationship," Tang Lingxi turned to look at him with a serious expression on her face.

"And if you reveal your relationship with a few individuals to the world and the Heavenly Emperor, would they still dare to touch you? I understand that you don’t want to rely on us too much as the head of the family, but there are times when you must let us help you. After all, we’re your family."

"I know, but those individuals... I don’t know how they will feel about me revealing our relationship to the world. While I know what most of you think, there are times when one’s action doesn’t correspond to their character, and that is only natural," Su Yang said.

And he continued a moment later, "By the way, Lingxi, what happened to the rest of the family? What happened to the Family Seal after my death? Since I died in that world, the Family Seal should’ve also disappeared with me, right?"

Tang Lingxi then shook her head, "No, the Family Seal didn’t disappear. I was going to let you know about this once you’ve returned, but since you asked now... The Family Seal remained on our body, but it is no longer activated. However, even though it isn’t activated, the family rule still applies to us. I have never seen anything like this before."

"What? That is indeed unprecedented..." Su Yang mumbled in a surprised voice.

When one dies, it is common sense that the Family Seal of that person would also perish, but for some reason, even though he’d supposedly ’died’, Su Yang’s Family Seal remained on his women’s body, and despite being deactivated, the family rule was still active.

"I guess I’ll have to reactivate everyone’s Family Seal once I return. However, there is also a chance that they have already moved on, so the family might downsize a little bit," Su Yang sighed once again.

"Don’t underestimate our love for you, Su Yang. I have spoken with most of the family after your death, and although they’d left the family to do other things, they remain loyal to you, as they will continue to do so until their last breath," Tang Lingxi said to him.

"And you... Although you may not realize it yourself, you’ve changed a lot compared to your previous self, my darling. I’m not saying you aren’t good the way you were before, but I kind of like the current you even more."

"No, I am definitely aware of my own changes. I guess this is what happens when you spend enough time in the mortal realm and you are surrounded by only mortals. And while it’s only been a year, it feels like much longer has passed for me," Su Yang said.

"Lingxi... Thank you for coming here," Su Yang suddenly said to her with a heartfelt look on his face.

"I know you’re doing your best to hold back since you cannot cultivate with me in that body, but I am also doing my best here. Once I return, I swear I will make up for the time lost and cultivate with you for as long as you want."

"You better make it up for me! You have no idea how much I am suffering! Even though I don’t show it, I am extremely envious of those people around us! They get to cultivate with you every day as much as they want, yet I am only allowed to be near your side! This is akin to torture for me!"

"One month— No, I am going to cultivate with you for many years straight once you return to the Divine Heavens!" Tang Lingxi said with her fingers raised.

Su Yang nodded with a handsome smile on his face, "Although I won’t be able to do that immediately after returning to the Divine Heavens, I’ll cultivate with you for ten years straight if you want to after everything is settled."

"It’s a promise then." Tang Lingxi suddenly extended her pinky finger.

"You can be really childish at times, you know?" Su Yang chuckled as he pinky swore with Tang Lingxi. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Su Yang and Tang Lingxi continued to talk about random things for the entire day.

Once it was dark and the starry night appeared, the two of them proceeded to watch the stars in silence until it was morning again where Tang Lingxi brought up another topic and the two of them continued to talk for another day.

Time passed quickly, and three days passed in the blink of an eye.

"I guess it’s about time I leave this body and return to my original body in the Divine Heavens..." Tang Lingxi looked at her hands that were trembling uncontrollably.

She then lifted her head to look at Su Yang with tears in her eyes, dumbfounding him, who has never seen her cry before.

"To tell you the truth, darling, I am incredibly scared right now— scared that once I leave this body and return to the Divine Heavens, I will wake up and everything that has happened here will turn out to be nothing but a mere dream and that you are actually dead," Tang Lingxi spoke with tears flowing down her beautiful face.

"What if I never get to see you again once I leave this body? What if you never make it back to the Divine Heavens? These uncertainties... I am feeling real fear for the first time in my life."

"Lingxi..." Su Yang went to wipe her tears after he snapped out of his daze, and he said to her, "Don’t worry, I promise you that this is not a dream and that I am real. Once you return to the Divine Heavens, I will follow you shortly."

"You promise?" Tang Lingxi said.

"I promise."

"I’ll go on a rampage in the Divine Heavens if you don’t return, and I might end up destroying the damn Heavenly Family that was the cause of all of this," Tang Lingxi suddenly added.

"G-Give me a few years before you decide to go crazy, okay? I don’t want you to get hurt and end up like me..." Su Yang said with a stiff smile and his back soaked in cold sweats.

"Ten years. I will give you ten years more years to return to the Divine Heavens," Tang Lingxi said with a smile on her face.

"More than enough time." Su Yang nodded.

"Then I shall wait for you at ’that’ place for ten years until you return," Tang Lingxi suddenly said.

"That place, huh. I’ll be there— I promise." Su Yang made another promise to her.

"Oh, by the way..."

Tang Lingxi suddenly grabbed Su Yang’s face and pulled it towards her own, gently kissing him on the lips.

Although he was surprised, Su Yang didn’t say anything and savored this moment.

An entire minute later, once Tang Lingxi removed her lips, she said to him with a beautiful smile on her face, "Don’t worry, I had permission to do that from Hong Yu’er. Anyway, I’ll see you later, darling."

Su Yang nodded and said, "I’ll see you later, my dear Lingxi."

Tang Lingxi then stood there and took a deep breath before closing her eyes.

Tang Lingxi opened her eyes a few moments later, but her eyes gave a different feeling, as was her aura, almost like she’d become a different person.

"Welcome back, Hong Yu’er, and thank you for allowing Tang Lingxi to borrow your body— you have my utmost gratitude," Su Yang said to her in a sincere voice and with his head slightly lowered, something that rarely happens.

"Su Yang..." Hong Yu’er stared at Su Yang with a profound feeling in her gaze, looking like she had a lot in her mind.
