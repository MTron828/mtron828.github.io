Chapter 671 - Dinner at Nine Spring Hall

Once the sky has darkened enough, Su Yang prepared to head to Lian Li’s living quarters for dinner.

"Her Highness lives three blocks down and her house number should be house number 99," Wu Jingjing said to him.

"I understand." Su Yang nodded as he stepped outside.

"Good luck, Su Yang." Wu Jingjing said to him before he left.

A few minutes later, Su Yang found the building with the number 99 on the front door. He approached the entrance and knocked on it.

Lian Li opened the door a moment while wearing beautiful and luxurious clothes that enhanced her beauty significantly and said to him with a calm expression on her face, "So you’re finally here, huh?"

"I’m sorry if I made you wait too long," he said.

"I don’t mind."

"Where should we go for dinner?"

"I have already made reservations for us at the Nine Spring Hall, we can leave at any time." Lian Li said.

"Nine Spring Halls, huh? Okay."

Lian Li then stepped outside of her house and began flying away shortly later.

Seeing this, Su Yang silently followed her with a smile on his face.

A few minutes later, Su Yang said to her while they were in the air, "I didn’t get the chance to say this back there, but you look very stunning in that outfit."

"Save your compliments for your wife. I am not going to be swayed by your honeyed words, and we are only going to eat dinner. If you were expecting something else then I am sorry— not."

"Whatever you say, Your Highness," Su Yang responded with a calm voice.

"It’s too late to start respecting me now, as you have already trampled my face to an unrecoverable state in front of thousands of people..." Lian Li spoke in a cold voice.

Because of what happened during the sword battle, people are already giving her disrespectful nicknames such as ’Princess Piss Herself’ and ’Silver River Princess’ behind her back!

"..."

Su Yang decided not to say anything else and silently followed her to the Nine Spring Halls.

Once they reached the Nine Spring Halls, there were already many servants waiting outside the restaurant.

"Welcome to the Nine Spring Hall, Your Highness!"

The servants immediately lowered their heads to greet her.

"Your Highness, the Nine Spring Hall, and everyone here is greatly honored by your presence." Jiu Chun, the owner of the restaurant appeared a moment later and said to her.

"Take us to our room," Lian Li said to him.

"Right away!"

Jiu Chun glanced at Su Yang with a mysterious light in his eyes before turning around and leading them to the highest floor in the restaurant. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

"..."

Su Yang did not miss Jiu Chun’s odd gaze, and he silently pondered why Jiu Chun would look at him in such a manner.

A few minutes later, they reached the ninth and highest floor of the restaurant and took a seat in the only room on that floor.

Once they were seated and served tea, Jiu Chun asked them, "What would you like to eat tonight, esteemed guest?"

To Su Yang’s surprise, Jiu Chun decided to ask him what he wanted to eat before asking Lian Li, which is a clear sign of disrespect to her status. However, Lian Li did not react to this and merely sipped her tea in silence.

"Give me the most popular dish," Su Yang casually said.

"I understand. We’ll be right back with your food," Jiu Chun said before walking out the room, completely ignoring Lian Li.

"...Are you not going to eat?" he asked her with raised eyebrows. "I cannot consider this as having dinner with you if I am the only one eating."

"Don’t worry, I have already told them what I wanted to eat when I made the reservation," she said to him in a calm voice.

Su Yang nodded his head at her words, but he couldn’t stop getting this awkward and suspicious vibe in the atmosphere.

’What are you planning?’ Su Yang calmly stared at Lian Li’s beautiful face while he pondered in silence.

"What are you looking at? Stop staring at me with that vulgar gaze," Lian Li finally spoke a few minutes later.

"I cannot help it. Anyone would be staring if there’s such a beautiful woman sitting in front of them," Su Yang chuckled.

"Hmph! Like I’d said before, you can keep your flattery to yourself, as it won’t have any effect on me!" Lian Li coldly snorted.

"Well, if you do not want to hear praises, would you like to hear about swords? I might teach you a thing or two about Sword Will, you know." Su Yang asked her with a mysterious grin on his face.

"R-Really? You’ll teach me about Sword Will?"

Even though she knew he was trying to bait her into a conversation, Lian Li couldn’t help but immediately bite into his bait, as her sword-loving character longed to know more about Sword Will.

"Yes," he nodded before continuing, "It’s not like Sword Will is a secret or anything like that. As long as you practice enough, I’m sure someone with your talent will be able to learn it in the near future."

Su Yang then proceeded to talk briefly about Sword Will and its foundations, which Lian Li listened to with perked ears and a serious expression, almost like a cat.

Time passed extremely quickly once Lian Li was engrossed in Su Yang’s sword talks, and before they were aware, Jiu Chun had returned to the room with over a dozen dishes, each emitting strong spiritual energy.

"Thank you for your patience. Here is what we have prepared for you—"

Jiu Chun proceeded to explain every dish on the table to them.

A few minutes later, Jiu Chun bowed to them before leaving the room, "I hope you’ll enjoy your meal, esteemed guest."

A subtle but sinister light flickered in Jiu Chun’s eyes as he left the room.

’These people are definitely planning something... but what?’ Su Yang acted as though he didn’t notice and pondered silently.
