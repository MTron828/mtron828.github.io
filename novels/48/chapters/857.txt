Chapter 858 - 500 Years

"Make sure you plant them at least three meters apart from each other or the Seven Silver Blades won’t grow." Su Yang said to her.

"Okay!"

The two of them proceeded to spend the next few hours planting seeds all over the land behind the Profound Blossom Sect.

"What should we do now, Su Yang?" Feng Zhelan asked him afterward.

"That’s something for Xiao Bai to decide. Let’s go see her right now." Su Yang said.

Fang Zhelan nodded and followed him back to her house where she was keeping Xiao Bai.

However, since Xiao Bai has grown to the point where she could no longer stay with Fang Zhelan in her house, much less her room, Xiao Bai would spend most of her time in the large courtyard behind Fang Zhelan’s living quarters.

"Xiao Bai."

Xiao Bai suddenly heard her name being spoken in one of her favorite voices— Su Yang’s voice.

The ground shook as Xiao Bai ran to Su Yang and Fang Zhelan’s side, l.i.c.k.i.n.g him all over his body once she was able to.

Xiao Bai was around five meters tall when she stood on all four, so she was about two times taller than most humans, and a single lick from her could easily lick even an a.d.u.l.t’s entire front body.

"Xiao Bai, we’re here to talk to you about our departure. I know Zhelan has already spoken to you about it, but I also want to say something." Su Yang said to her a moment later.

Xiao Bai began making weird noises after hearing Su Yang’s words, sounding like it was crying from pain.

"I know you’re upset and want to come with us to the Divine Heavens, but you’re better off in this world, honestly." Su Yang said to her.

And he continued, "You can freely roam this world in your current state, but if you come to the Divine Heavens with us, you’ll most likely be stuck in one place for a very, very long time."

However, Xiao Bai continued to make weird noises, clearly reluctant to be left behind.

After pondering for a moment, Su Yang said, "Xiao Bai, how about this?"

Xiao Bai immediately stopped making noises and stared at him with a focused gaze.

"500 years. You will stay in this world and the Profound Blossom Sect for 500 years as its Guardian Spirit. Once these 500 years have passed and you still want to come to the Divine Heavens, I will arrange for someone to take you to the Divine Heavens."

"You can use these 500 years to fully develop your strength so that when the time comes, you won’t be in as much danger when you come to the Divine Heavens, since magical beasts in the Divine Heavens are always hunting for Guardian Spirits, as your meat and blood grant them immense strength if they consume you." Su Yang said to her.

"Furthermore, if we somehow finish our business at the Divine Heavens before these 500 years are over, we will try our best to come back to this world to bring you back with us." Su Yang said.

After a moment of silence, Fang Zhelan spoke, "Xiao Bai, I know it’s hard for you since it’s also hard for me to leave you behind. However, I also don’t want to endanger you by bringing you with us, especially after hearing about how they treat Guardian Spirits in the Divine Heavens..."

Xiao Bai tilted her head after hearing Fang Zhelan’s words. How do they treat Guardian Spirits in the Divine Heavens?

Seeing Xiao Bai’s puzzled expression, Su Yang said, "In the Divine Heavens, magical beasts hunt Guardian Spirits for their flesh and blood, while cultivators hunt Guardian Spirits for their Spirit Core and bones to make treasures with it. In other words, the entire world is hunting for your kind because of your special body and unique bloodline, and only the most powerful Guardian Spirits are exempt from this, but even then, that’s only because they have powerful backings to protect them."

The fur on Xiao Bai’s body strengthened like a steel needle after hearing Su Yang’s words. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

"If we were stronger— strong enough to protect you, we would’ve brought you with us. However, we don’t have such strength, and I even worry if I’ll really be able to protect my own family in the Divine Heavens with my current strength. I hope you can understand our reason for leaving you behind."

"Thank you, Xiao Bai. We’ll definitely bring you to the Divine Heavens once we have the capabilities to do so!" Su Yang said to her.

Sometime later, after telling Xiao Bai about the Seven Silver Blades farm behind the Profound Blossom Sect, he returned to the Yin Yang Pavilion with Fang Zhelan.

"Su Yang... 500 years is a long time... Maybe you could shorten it a bit?" Fang Zhelan suddenly asked him.

"Don’t worry, 500 years is nothing, especially to Xiao Bai who can easily live for tens of thousands of years. In her eyes, 500 years is no different than 5 years. As for us... Once you go to the Divine Heavens, you’ll understand how insignificant and short 500 years is..." Su Yang said to her.

"Okay..." Fang Zhelan nodded.

And in order to get her mind off leaving Xiao Bai behind, Fang Zhelan spent the next few hours cultivating with Su Yang.

The following day, Su Yang left the Yin Yang Pavilion and returned to his daily routine, cultivating with the disciples.

Time passed quickly, and in the blink of an eye, another month disappeared.

"Sect Master, you have a guest!"

Su Yang’s communication jade slip suddenly trembled.

"Who is it?" Su Yang, who was laying in bed with a n.a.k.e.d Lian Li by his side, asked the voice behind the jade slip.

"I-It’s... It’s Hong Yu’er, Sect Master!" The voice responded.

"Hong Yu’er...?" Su Yang immediately raised his eyebrows.

"Hong Yu’er... The young lady who hosted Sister Lingxi’s soul?" Lian Li mumbled in a dazed voice.
