Chapter 849 - Liu Lanzhi's Request

"Liu Lanzhi... You..." Su Yang opened his mouth but was quickly interrupted by her.

"Don’t even try to convince me, Su Yang. I have already made up my mind regarding this matter just like how you’d decided to leave this world and return to the Divine Heavens— I have decided to give up my career as a dual cultivator and become a normal cultivator instead."

"A regular cultivator, huh..." Su Yang mumbled, as he never thought the way would come when Liu Lanzhi would give up dual cultivating.

"Are you sure you don’t want to come to the Divine Heavens with me? This way, you won’t have to give up being a dual cultivator."

"I am certain." Liu Lanzhi nodded with a resolute expression on her face, becoming the first woman in this world to refuse his offer.

However, Su Yang could see the pain in Liu Lanzhi’s eyes when she refused him. Despite this, he didn’t continue trying to convince her since he knew that it would only make her feel worse for rejecting him.

"I may no longer be a dual cultivator, but I have enough experience to continue teaching the disciples who wish to become one. Furthermore, even if my cultivation slows down, I am completely fine with that, since I am already at the Heaven Spirit Realm. Once someone in the sect surpasses me or when I feel like it’s the right time, I’ll step down as the Sect Master and live the rest of my life in peace."

"I see... If that’s your choice, I will respect it." Su Yang nodded.

"As for Feng Xindou... Although I have cultivated with her many times during her stay at the Profound Blossom Sect, I have never once used any techniques that her husband doesn’t know, and I made sure to hold myself back so that she doesn’t become addicted to it."

"Huh? You don’t mean..." Liu Lanzhi’s eyes widened with surprise when she realized the situation.

Su Yang nodded and confirmed her thoughts, "If I really wanted to steal Feng Xindou away from Emperor Lian, I could easily do it in a single session. However, I held myself back. After all, I only steal from men who don’t deserve their wives or partners. Emperor Lian... I can tell that he truly adores Feng Xindou."

"Su Yang... You’re really something else..." Liu Lanzhi stared at him with a dazed look on her beautiful face.

"You’re probably the only person in this world who can say such words with a confident face."

In this entire world, Su Yang would be the only person who can claim that he can easily steal others’ partners.

A moment later, Liu Lanzhi mumbled in a low voice, "Hey... Su Yang..."

"Yes?"

"Do you think... Do you think I can bear your child?"

"Eh?" Su Yang’s eyes widened with surprise after hearing her question.

She turned to look at him with an emotional gaze, "I know... I am as surprised as you right now since I never thought that I’d want to get pregnant with a child, especially knowing my status. However, I really want one with you, Su Yang. I want something to remember you by— something permanent. You can argue that I can use the Profound Blossom Sect, but I don’t plan on being a Sect Master forever, and I want something more sentimental— like a child."

"If you don’t want to that’s fine as well—"

"Okay." Su Yang suddenly interrupted, taking Liu Lanzhi by surprise.

"R-Really? You should take some time to think about it..."

Su Yang shook his head and said, "Since I cannot take you with me and I cannot stay here, I can, at the very least, leave a part of me behind with you. Therefore, I’m willing to conceive a child with you, Liu Lanzhi."

"Su Yang..."

Tears flowed from Liu Lanzhi’s eyes, as she didn’t expect Su Yang to agree so easily.

Su Yang then approached her with his rod stiff and twitching from excitement.

"The question now is when do you want to bear this child?" he then asked her. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

"N-Now! I want it now!" she quickly responded.

Su Yang nodded and plugged his rod inside her body, and they began cultivating with each other again, but the atmosphere between them was much different this time compared to all of their sessions prior to this one.

Meanwhile, in Emperor Lian’s room, Feng Xindou laid on the bed while completely n.a.k.e.d and with white stuff sticking to her stomach and c.h.e.s.t.

"W-What do you think...?" Emperor Lian asked her in a somewhat exhausted voice, clearly putting a lot of effort into pleasuring her.

In a slightly surprised voice, Feng Xindou spoke, "Although it’s still nowhere near as good as Su Yang’s techniques, I can tell that you’d improved drastically since we last did it, and I... I think it’s enough to satisfy me..."

"Really?!" Emperor Lian’s eyes flashed with excitement after hearing her words. Even though he was still not near Su Yang’s level, at least he got Feng Xindou’s approval!

"Does this mean you’ll come back to me?" Emperor Lian then asked.

After a moment of silence, Feng Xindou nodded her head and confirmed, "Yes, I’ll return to the house."

Although she didn’t say it for obvious reasons, Feng Xindou actually wanted to stay in the Profound Blossom Sect for a few more months until Su Yang finally leaves this world since she still preferred him and he won’t be in this world forever. However, she was afraid that if she decided to do this that her faith for her own husband would fade even more, and that’s something extremely hard to recover once lost.

"T-Thank you!" Emperor Lian leaped at Feng Xindou and immediately began kissing her passionately.

Two days passed in a flash, and the day of the gathering has finally arrived.

"Are you ready?" Su Yang asked Liu Lanzhi, both of them fully dressed.

Liu Lanzhi nodded her head, and she followed him outside the room while she rubbed her stomach with a gentle smile on her face, feeling full from Su Yang’s hot Yang Qi.

And unlike previously, she wasn’t doing this to increase her cultivation faster. Instead, it was so she could conceive his child.
