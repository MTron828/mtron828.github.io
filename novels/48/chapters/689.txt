Chapter 690 Treating Feng Xindou

Nearly an entire day has passed since Su Yang began treating Feng Xindou, yet he hasn’t touched a single hair on her body, only pouring Virgin’s Blood and a few other medicines on her body.

On the second day, Feng Xindou’s appearance looked vastly different compared to the first day of treatment, and she no longer resembled a dried-up corpse. However, her body was still very skinny, and her complexion was pale, looking very unhealthy, and malnourished.

As Su Yang poured a new bottle of Virgin’s Blood onto Feng Xindou’s body, her lips moved slightly, and a hoarse voice resounded, "Thank... you... Su... Yang..."

Su Yang smiled after hearing her voice, and he said, "I see that you’re capable of speaking now. That’s good news, but don’t push yourself, and you can thank me after you have completely recovered."

"Un..." Feng Xindou nodded her head slightly before closing her eyes again.

A few moments later, Feng Xindou’s body began releasing more Yin Qi, but it was no longer stained with blood and resembled clear water in a clean pond.

A few more hours later, Su Yang returned to her side, but he didn’t have any more Virgin’s Blood in his hands.

"This is a pill that will help you recover some strength; it contains some Profound Qi of the Yang Element inside, which will help you subdue your Yin Qi to a certain degree."

After a brief explanation, Su Yang tossed the pill into his mouth before crushing it with his teeth and drinking some water. Once he mixed the pill and the water inside his mouth, Su Yang opened Feng Xindou’s mouth with his hands before feeding the medicine to her through his own mouth.

Towards the end of the second day, Feng Xindou no longer looked malnourished and appeared no different than any other healthy women, even looking mighty stunning with her smooth skin and a beautiful pale complexion.

"As expected of Lian Li’s mother— you are quite an exquisite woman." Su Yang said to her with a smile on his handsome face.

"..."

Feng Xindou looked at her own fair hands while she laid on the bed, seemingly in a daze.

"I thought... I thought I was going to die while being in that horrifying state for the remainder of my life..." she mumbled with teary eyes sometime later.

"Well, that is most likely what would’ve happened if I didn’t come here by chance," Su Yang said to her.

"Yes, and I owe my life to you, my savior..." Feng Xiandou who profoundly resembled Lian Li turned to look at him with a passionate gaze, clearly feeling some sort of affection towards him, who just pulled her out from a dark and empty hole and saved her life.

"Don’t get ahead of yourself just yet— you have not completely recovered. In fact, we are only halfway there," Su Yang said to her.

"Really? But I feel just fine..." Feng Xindou said with a puzzled face. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

"That is only a temporary feeling since I’d submerged your body in medicine for two whole days now. If I don’t finish my treatment, you’ll simply return to that corpse-like state a few weeks later."

"!!!" Feng Xindou’s body trembled in fear after hearing his words.

"What else needs to be done, savior? I’ll do anything you need!" she quickly said to him, as she would rather die than return to that pathetic and horrifying state.

"If we continue to treat you the same way I have been treating you for the past two days, it’ll take many weeks, even months to completely heal your body, and there’ll be a shortage problem for the supplies used to create the medicine. Therefore, I am going to speed the process up by physically touching you, if you don’t mind."

"Physically touch my body...?" Feng Xiandou looked down at her own body, which was completely naked at this moment.

"I know you already have a caring husband, but—"

"It’s fine," she suddenly interrupted him.

"Hm?" Su Yang raised his eyebrows in a slightly surprised manner.

"Ever since I gave birth to my second child, Lian Heng, I haven’t received any affection from my husband for many decades. Although I cannot bear to betray him with another man, there is only so much a woman can endure before she makes mistakes..."

Feng Xiandou then looked at Su Yang and asked him, "Since I am your patient and you are treating me, this is only considered treatment, right?"

After a moment of silence, Su Yang nodded his head, "That’s right. This is part of the treatment, and I have already let your husband know that this might happen, and he has already accepted it."

"Thank you for telling me that, I already feel less guilty..." Feng Xindou said with a relieved smile as she laid on the bed again.

"Go ahead, doctor. Do whatever you need for the ’treatment’." Feng Xindou said to him with her eyes closed.

Su Yang then climbed onto the bed before caressing her smooth skin with the tip of his fingers, sending chills all over her body.

After completely familiarizing himself with the feeling of Feng Xiandou’s body, Su Yang moved his hands towards her lower body, gently sliding his fingers down her slender legs before teasing the slit between her legs, brushing past the black bush directly above her cave.

"I... I haven’t gotten the chance to personally clean that area for many years now..." Feng Xindou said in a bashful voice, referring to the patch of pubic hair down there. "I-If it’s bothering you, I can remove it..."

Because having hair down there for women is seen as unhygienic, unladylike, and disliked by many men who prefer their women ’pure’ and ’spotless’, most women usually keep that place clean and spotless by removing the hair with medicine or using a cultivation technique that prevents hair from growing down there.

"It’s fine," Su Yang said to her in a relaxed voice, "Although some might dislike it, I don’t mind it. In fact, it makes you appear more mature and unique."

"Su Yang..."

Empress Feng Xindou nodded her head afterward, no longer feeling as embarrassed about her bush.
