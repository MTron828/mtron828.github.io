Chapter 960 Visiting Mei Xing“s Mother

After a hard day at work, the massage parlor finally closed.

"Manager, you were right. It’s only been a day since we started the priority system and it’s already widespread news. At this rate, we really might have to work around the clock." Mei Xing said to him.

Su Yang smiled and said, "Don’t worry, I will limit the number of priority customers every day to five, and it will be on a first come first serve basis. Furthermore, there won’t be a waitlist for priority customers so if they miss it, they will have to try again the next day. While there are some flaws in this system, let’s just see how well it goes for now."

"Anyways, now that work is done, let’s go see your mother, shall we?" Su Yang then said.

"Eh? You’re going to visit her now? But she’s still working." Mei Xing said to him.

"I know. I will visit her as a customer." Su Yang said with a smile.

"Okay!" Mei Xing nodded with enthusiasm.

After locking the store, Su Yang followed Mei Xing to her mother’s workplace.

"Is that the Manager of Heavenly Massage? This is my first time seeing him outside his store." The other store owners were immediately attracted by his presence.

"He’s the Manager of the Heavenly Massage? He’s more ordinary-looking than I’d expected," said someone else.

"He’s also much younger than I’d expected. Someone said that he was a scholar— or tried to become one, right? He does give off a scholarly aura..."

"Do you think he’s single? Although his looks are ordinary, his hand techniques are godlike."

"If he’s working in the City of Pleasure, there’s a good chance that he’s single. Don’t tell me you’re trying to start a relationship with someone so plain? You’ll quickly become a laughing stock."

"So what if he’s plain-looking? If he can please my body every day with his techniques, I wouldn’t mind becoming a laughingstock, and I am willing to bet many of his customers share the same sentiment as me."

"Whatever..."

Sometime later, Su Yang arrived before this street that reeked of Yin Qi and Yang Qi, not to mention the constant moaning that could be heard. Although it wasn’t as obnoxious as when his customers moaned, it was still pretty noticeable.

Furthermore, compared to the other parts of the Pink Light District, this street appeared to be less clean, and even the buildings looked a little run-down.

Su Yang glanced at Mei Xing by his side. To think such a little girl would live in this kind of environment. It was definitely quite pitiful.

"Manager, my mother works at that building." Mei Xing pointed at a certain building with a pink sign.

"Okay, let’s go." Su Yang then approached the building, where a tall middle-aged man stood by the door.

"I don’t recognize you. Is this your first time here?" The middle-aged man asked Su Yang the moment he got close.

"Yes, and I am here to see her mother." Su Yang pointed at Mei Xing, who was standing behind him.

"Hmm?"

The man finally noticed Mei Xing, and he said, "Her mother is fully booked for the entire week, so you’ll have to come back next—"

Before the man could even finish his sentence, Su Yang retrieved a medium-grade spirit stone and held it before the man.

"Perhaps we can negotiate." Su Yang said with a smile on his face.

The man’s eyes widened with shock when he realized that Su Yang was showing him.

"I-I’m sure the other customers will understand, Esteemed guest." The man quickly changed his attitude and started treating Su Yang like a VIP.

"How long do you intend on staying?" The man then asked.

"I will stay here overnight. Do you mind?"

"N-Not at all! Esteemed guest can stay here for as long as he desires if he wishes!"

A single medium-grade spirit stone was worth 1 million gold coins, and this brothel had only mortal women. With so much money, Su Yang can have fun with every single woman in the brothel every day for a whole year and still have money left.

"If you want, I can even have the other ladies accompany you!" The man offered him every single woman in the brothel.

However, Su Yang shook his head and refused, "I am only here to see her mother." Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

"I understand. Her current customer should be done in a few minutes if you don’t mind."

Su Yang nodded and proceeded to stand around with Mei Xing.

About five minutes later, a skinny man left the building with a satisfied look on his face.

"Esteemed guest, she’s available now. She’s on the 3rd floor." The man said to him.

Su Yang then entered the building with Mei Xing, walking up the dark staircase that only had enough room for a single person, and every step he took made the staircase squeak.

Once he reached the third floor and encountered three different doors, Su Yang asked, "Which room?"

Mei Xing quickly responded, "The room on the right."

Su Yang then knocked on the door to the right.

"Please enter." A gentle voice quickly resounded from inside the room.

Su Yang opened the door and entered the room, where a beautiful young woman could be seen sitting naked on her bed and with a soft smile on her face.

Despite being a mortal, this woman was incredibly beautiful— a natural beauty. Seeing her appearance, Su Yang understood why she was fully booked for an entire week.

"Mother!" Mei Xing entered the room a moment later, surprising her mother.

"M-Mei Xing? What are you doing here? Quickly, leave now!" Her mother spoke in a slightly loud voice, as she was about to receive a customer.

"It’s okay, she’s with me." Su Yang then said.

"Eh?"

Seeing her mother’s puzzled face, Mei Xing spoke, "Mother, this is the Manager that I have been telling you about. He agreed to visit you when I asked, so here he is!"

"T-The Manager...?" Her mother stared at Su Yang with a dumbfounded expression.
