Chapter 876 - Xian Ni's Decision

"Xian Ni? What are you doing here? Don’t tell me you came all the way here just to say goodbye to me." Su Yang said to him.

Indeed, it was Ancestor Xian from the Western Continent.

"Hahaha..." Xian Ni laughed out loud for a good moment before speaking, "Of course not. I’m here because I also want to go to the Divine Heavens."

"What?" Su Yang’s eyes widened.

"After meeting you, I have realized how small my view actually is— like a frog inside a well. I want to broaden my views by going to the Divine Heavens, and hopefully, I will be able to continue cultivating even more." Xian Ni said.

And he continued, "I have realized this long ago, but as long as I stay in this world, my cultivation will not go any higher. Therefore, I can only take my chances in another world where the spiritual energy is much stronger there. Perhaps I can even experience life as a disciple again."

Su Yang smiled and said, "You may be a peak expert in this world, but in the Divine Heavens, being a Sovereign at your age... I’m sorry if this sounds harsh, but you will be compared to trash very often. You’ll have a hard time finding a sect that’s willing to accept you as a disciple."

Xian Ni laughed even louder after hearing Su Yang’s words.

"That’s even better! I like a good challenge!" Xian Ni said.

"What did your family say?"

"Hm? They were surprised, but that doesn’t matter. I am already barely in their lives these days. It won’t make a difference whether I’m in this world or not." Xian Ni said.

It was common for him to disappear for decades— even centuries without any notices, so his family probably wouldn’t even notice that he’d left this world unless he told them beforehand.

"I see... Well, even though your cultivation is pretty bad for someone your age, that is only because of the limits in this world. If you had been born in the Divine Heavens, you would probably be a pretty powerful Body Refiner by now, so you might still have a chance." Su Yang suddenly said to him.

"What? Really? You really think so?" Xiang Ni’s eyes widened with surprise after hearing Su Yang’s remarks.

"Yes. You’re pretty talented. I noticed it when we sparred with each other. Your physique is pretty solid. If only you’d been given a good technique and trained properly." Su Yang nodded.

"Hahaha! This is great news! Thank you, Su Yang!" Xian Ni bowed to him.

"By the way, the teleportation formation you made worked like wonders. Although it had cost me a couple of millions of spirit stones, I was able to teleport from the Western Continent to the Southern Continent without any troubles, and it was also almost instantaneous." Xian Ni gave Su Yang his feedback on the teleport formations.

"Good to hear." Su Yang said.

"Anyways, how long until we can go to the Divine Heavens?" Xian Ni then asked.

"Judging by the spiritual energy in the area, the treasure should be very close to appearing. I wouldn’t be surprised if it appears today."

"I see... Then if you’re not busy, let’s talk until it appears. I want to learn more about the Divine Heavens before we go, after all."

Su Yang nodded, "Sure. I just finished cultivating with everyone, anyway."

Xian Ni smiled at his words, "Lucky bastard."

Sometime later, Su Yang and Xian Ni began chatting with each other.

"As the name Four Divine Heavens implies, there are four different worlds in the place we’re going. Of course, there are other worlds, but they are too small when compared to the Divine Heavens to be considered a ’world’. These small words are usually called Minor Heavens, but there are famous ones that have their own name. The Four Divine Heavens are the major ones, and they consist of the Spirit Heaven, Martial Heaven, Celestial Heaven, and lastly, the Jade Heaven."

"I was born in the Celestial Heaven, which is ranked 3rd amongst all the Four Divine Heavens."

"Wait, they’re ranked? By what? Their strength?" Xian Ni asked.

"Yes, each world is ranked by the overall prowess that occupies their world and other things, but ultimately, it’s decided by a tournament that has each worlds’ strongest Cultivators fight against each other."

"Most people don’t care about the rank of each Divine Heavens. It’s usually only the lords of the Divine Heavens that really care about it."

"Lords...? Like rulers?" Xian Ni asked.

Su Yang nodded, "Just like how every continent in this world has its own ruling family, there is a ruler for each of the Divine Heavens. However, there is one true ruler in the Four Divine Heavens, and that is the Heavenly Emperor. The other four are merely his pawns that were given the right to rule. In fact, the Heavenly Emperor rules not just the Four Divine Heavens but also all of the Minor Heavens around it."

"Good lord... the Heavenly Emperor... How powerful must this guy be in order to rule the heavens?"

Su Yang showed a bittersweet smile and said, "He’s powerful— very powerful. However, he’s not the most powerful cultivator in the world. It’s his connections and the strength of his family that allows him to rule the heavens."

"Anyways, enough about the Heavenly Emperor. Let me tell you about each of the Divine Heavens briefly so you have an understanding."

Thus, Su Yang continued to introduce the Divine Heavens to Xian Ni.

"The Celestial Heaven and Martial Heaven are pretty much the same when it comes to similarities between each world with only some differences in their environments and whatnot."

"It’s only the Spirit Heaven and Jade Heaven that truly differentiates itself from the others." Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

"The Jade Heaven is ranked fourth, but they are mostly famous for their wealth. In other words, the wealthiest of the Four Divine Heavens is the Jade Heaven. They are so wealthy that even if the other three Divine Heavens combined their wealth together, it would still not surpass the Jade Heaven. If you want to make money, you should go to the Jade Heaven." Su Yang said to him.
