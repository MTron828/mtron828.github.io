Chapter 906 - Restrained Yin Sect

"Xiao Yang? What is your purpose for coming to this dangerous place? I’m talking about the Frozen Asgard." The woman asked him, clearly still doubtful of his identity and purpose there.

"I have some business at the Frozen Azure Cave, and this cave is the safest route there." Su Yang responded.​​

"And you can’t tell me the reason?" The woman continued to question him for more details. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

As a highly secretive and seclusive sect, it was normal for them to act like this, as there were plenty of people spying on them, and any new information about their sect would be worth a fortune to information brokers and those with unkind intentions.

After a moment of silence, he said, "We’re meeting someone there. As for that person’s identity, I’m sorry, but I cannot tell you."

The best thing to do in this situation was to tell them the truth without revealing everything, as he knew that disciples of the Restrained Yin Sect have multiple methods that can tell whether someone was lying or not.

Furthermore, this beautiful woman before him was an Ancient Realm expert. Even if Xiao Rong can defeat her with his assistance, it would be a pain in the a.s.s to deal with the other disciples, and he didn’t want to hurt these people, as he has a special relationship with their sect master.

The woman narrowed her eyes at Su Yang’s chubby face before turning to look at Xiao Rong.

"The two of you managed to make it to the center of the Frozen Asgard without any injuries? In fact, you look extremely calm, almost like you’re taking a stroll in the park."

"Well, I happen to have a lot of knowledge regarding the Frozen Asgard, including all of the hidden passages, hence why I am here right now," he said.

"Even if that is the case— that you know all of the hidden passages, getting here unscathed is an entirely different story. We also took the hidden passages here, but none of us made it here unscathed," said the woman, continuing to doubt him.

"I don’t know what to tell you. Perhaps we got super lucky." Su Yang shrugged.

The woman didn’t find his joke funny and even pulled out a sword before pointing it at him.

Su Yang raised his hands in a surrendering manner and said, "Whoa, calm down. I know the Restrained Yin Sect is a secretive place, so I don’t blame you at all for your over-the-top cautiousness, but you need to calm down. Not everyone in this world is out to spy on you ladies."

"W-What did you just say?" The woman’s eyes widened with surprise.

Meanwhile, the woman questioning Su Yang suddenly began emitting killing intent, and she spoke in a cold voice, "Unless you’re a spy, there’s no way you’d know that we’re from the Restrained Yin Sect!"

"What? Your uniform says everything."

"That’s impossible! These are not our ordinary sect uniforms! We only wear them when we go outside for training so that people won’t recognize us!"

Su Yang chuckled and said, "Yes, I know. I also know that your sect master is named Liang Xuemei, and she really likes to chew on ice. Oh, right. I can even tell you the hideout of your sect in the Eternal—"

BOOM!

The place suddenly shook as all of the disciples there suddenly began emitting killing intent.

If Su Yang dared to continue his sentence, they might kill him before he could even finish his sentence.

Su Yang smiled and said after a long pause, "Anyway, my point is that I already know everything there is to know about your Restrained Yin Sect, so there’s no point in me spying on you guys."

"Who are you, really? How do you know so much about our sect?" The woman asked him with a deep frown on her face.

"I told you already. I’m Xiao Yang," he responded with a gentle smile on his face.

"Bullshit! You know damn well that’s not what I want to know!" She exclaimed in an angry voice.

And she continued, "If you don’t tell me, I will kill you right here and now!"

"Are you sure that you want to kill me when you don’t know anything about me?" Su Yang said, the smile on his face turning cold.

"If I die today, your sect’s million-year legacy might crumble, and you will be blamed for it."

Hearing Su Yang’s words, the woman’s body and facial expression froze.

"Anyway, I don’t have all day here. I promise you that nothing will happen if you act like our encounter never happened today." Su Yang said, and he began moving again, walking around the woman.

To the disciples’ surprise, the woman didn’t attack Su Yang and allowed him to walk past her.

"Also, I will eventually visit the Restrained Yin Sect to speak with your sect master Liang Xuemei— if she’s still the sect master. Until then, keep our meeting here a secret. We both know that she will most likely throw a tantrum if you tell her that some stranger you don’t recognize has so much information about her sect."

"Elder... What should we do?" One of the disciples asked her afterward, breaking the silence.

The woman bit her lips and said, "Forget about that damn fatty! Forget about our conversation! Forget about everything that has happened here today!"

"If you want to experience the sect master’s fury, by all means, go ahead and tell her what happened today!" she continued.

The disciples swallowed nervously when they imagined their sect master angry. If they do such a thing, they will not be the only ones to suffer, as every disciple in the sect will suffer alongside them, and none of them wanted that to happen.

After a moment of silence, one by one, the disciples began swearing that they wouldn’t utter a single word about what happened today even if they were tortured.
