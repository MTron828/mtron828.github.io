Chapter 639 - Lowering His Head

"What do you want to bet on?" Lord Xie asked Su Yang a moment later.

"If I am being honest, you have nothing that I want," Su Yang casually shrugged his shoulders and continued, "So you tell me what you want from me first."

"You have nothing that I truly want either!" Lord Xie said to him with a frown. "However, there is something I want you to do— lower your head before me and apologize for the number of times you have disrespected me. Do you think you can do that?"

Su Yang raised his eyebrows and acted surprised, "You want me to lower my head? That’s quite an expensive demand you have there. It’ll cost you."

’Hahaha! Knowing your character, you probably won’t lower your head even if you were beaten to death, hence why I picked that!’ Lord Xie laughed inwardly.

"The number of times I have lowered my head for someone can be counted on one hand, and they are all women that I have wronged. If you want me to lower my head for the bet, then I will have to request for something of similar value, but even if I ask for your life, it won’t be enough to balance the scale." Su Yang said in a sighing voice.

"What!? You dare claim that my life is not worth as much as you lowering your head?!" Lord Xie looked at him with wide eyes, as he truly did not expect Su Yang to say such words. "Then what the hell do you want from me if even my life is not enough?"

"There is a saying that a man’s dignity and pride is worth more than their life. If I can locate the seal in this place before the Celestial Pond opens, I want you to run around Snowfall City n.a.k.e.d." Su Yang said with a calm voice.

"You want me to what?!" Lord Xie’s jaw dropped to the ground after hearing his unreasonable demand.

Even Xie Xingfang couldn’t help but cover her mouth from shock, not even daring to imagine the image of her father running around the city while n.a.k.e.d.

Meanwhile, Xie Wang chuckled at that idea.

"You are asking for too much, Su Yang! There’s no way that I would run around the city while n.a.k.e.d— not even if you torture me!" Lord Xie shouted angrily.

Su Yang shook his head and said, "You are such a difficult person to deal with. Fine, since I don’t want our alliance to end so quickly, I’ll make it easier for you— Instead of running n.a.k.e.d around the city, I want you to summon every family and sect in the Eastern Continent that’s under your control and have them gather at one place. Only one representative is needed from each power."

"What the heck?" Lord Xie looked at Su Yang with a dumbfounded face. What exactly is he trying to pull here?

"There are tens of thousands of families and thousands of sects out there. It’ll take months to arrange something like that. And for what purpose are you trying to gather so many people?" Lord Xie asked him with a frown.

"Let’s just say I have something important to announce," Su Yang calmly responded.

"Why can’t you just announce it to the public and let it spread naturally? That’ll be much more convenient than summoning every family in the Eastern Continent." Lord Xie said to him.

"Because it’ll leave a stronger impact if it’s done that way." Su Yang said.

He then continued, "Well? Can you do it or not? I’ll even give you a Heaven Transcendence Pill as a bonus."

"What? Heaven Transcendence Pill? How do you have something like that? And why are you making it sound like I have already lost?" Lord Xie frowned.

Hearing his words, Su Yang pointed in a certain direction and spoke in a calm voice, "The seal is 23 meters from where I am standing."

"..."

Lord Xie turned to look at the place Su Yang was pointed at and sure enough, that’s where the seal usually appears.

"How..." Lord Xie stared at Su Yang with his eyes wide as saucers. Does he really have the ability to see the seal? How did he do it when even the most talented formation experts in the world working together cannot figure it out?

"How I can see the formation is not important right now. Are you going to honor our bet and summon the families and sects or not? It’s either that or you run around the city while n.a.k.e.d." Su Yang said to him. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

"..."

Lord Xie immediately became speechless. He never even agreed to anything, as Su Yang had won the bet before they could even settle on it!

After a moment of silence, he finally spoke in a defeated voice, "You just want me to call for a summoning, right?"

"That’s right. You can pick the place and time, but make sure it won’t take longer than 9 months."

"I swear to the Heavens, Su Yang. If you are going to do something that’ll ruin my image..." Lord Xie stared at him with narrowed eyes.

Seeing his threatening gaze, Su Yang merely shrugged and said, "Don’t worry, it has nothing to do with you and everything to do with myself."

Sometime later, Liu Lanzhi spoke to him, "Should I even bother asking why you want to gather so many people?"

Su Yang smiled at her and said, "It’s for my farewell party."

"Your... what?" Liu Lanzhi looked at him with raised eyebrows, clearly puzzled by his words.

"You’ll understand when the time comes."

Sometime later, Lord Xie approached Liu Lanzhi and the other disciples and said to them, "There’s about an hour before the seal appears, and I want to take this time to explain to you what’s going to happen when that happens."

He then retrieved a few plain-looking talismans from his storage pouch and handed them to Liu Lanzhi and the disciples, "First and foremost, these talismans will tell you when your time is almost up, so when it activates, you must stop cultivating and leave the Celestial Pond, or you’ll be stuck inside for 100 years."
