Chapter 794 - Let Me Fight All of Them

After entering the city, Xian Ni brought Su Yang and the others to this enormous and ancient-looking coliseum that was filled with loud noises and shouting.

"Hey, where do I register my friend here to the tournament?" Xian Ni approached one of the workers there.

"Huh?" The young man turned to look at Xian Ni’s unique appearance with raised eyebrows, and then he sneered coldly, "I don’t know who you are, old man, but the registration date for the tournament expired last week! We’re no longer accepting any more participants no matter who you are or where you’re from!"

"Hoh? Is that so?" Xian Ni remained calm despite the young man’s lack of respect.

A moment later, he retrieved the Immortal Medallion and slammed it on the desk, nearly breaking it half.

"Are you sure you’re not accepting any more participants? Why don’t you double-check with your seniors, little boy?" Xian Ni said to the shocked young man who was shaking like he was experiencing an earthquake right beneath his feet.

"T-T-This is—! The Xian Family’s Immortal Medallion?! W-Why do you have something like this! It must be fake!" The young man gritted his teeth a moment later and stood up angrily, "You damn old man! How dare you scare me like that! There’s no way someone besides His Majesty can have the Immortal Medallion!"

"I’ll freaking report you to the Xian Family to get you executed for impersonating royalty!" The young man pointed at Xian Ni with an enraged expression on his face.

Xian Ni shook his head and sighed, "This new generation is truly pathetic to not even recognize their ancestors..."

After taking a deep breath, Xian Ni spoke again, but it was in a loud voice that shook the entire place, "CANG SHICAI, GET YOUR ASS OUT HERE!" ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The young man coughed up a mouthful of blood after feeling the immense pressure that nearly crushed his body, and he stared at Xian Ni with a terrified look on his face.

Everyone there also turned to look at them to see the commotion.

Not even a minute later, Cang Shicai could be seen flying towards them with a few individuals following behind him.

"What happened here, Ancestor Xian?!" Cang Shicai immediately bowed to Xian Ni after landing a few meters away from him.

Xian Ni pointed at the young man and said, "When a child cannot recognize their own ancestors, whose fault do you think it is? The child or the parents’ fault?"

Cang Shicai immediately turned to look at the young man and frowned, "What did you do to upset Ancestor Xian? If my mind isn’t playing tricks on me, there are plenty of pictures of Ancestor Xian in the Immortal Association’s headquarters. To not recognize the Ancestor of the Xian Family, do you walk with your head down, or are you actually blind?"

"A-Ancestor Xian?!" The young man nearly fainted from shock after learning that he’d blatantly disrespected the ancestor of the Xian Family.

"Anyway, although we are a little late, I am here to register my friend for the tournament. You won’t mind squeezing one more person into the list, right?" Xian Ni asked Cang Shicai.

Cang Shicai nodded his head with a nervous smile on his face despite already finalizing the roster and the fact that adding one more participant would mess up the entire thing.

"I don’t mind accepting one more individual into the tournament as long as he qualifies to participate in it," he said a moment later.

And he continued, "Since he already has the Xian Family’s recommendation, we only need to make sure that he’s not older than 50 years old. Please follow me so that we can test his bone age."

Sometime later, they arrived at this room that had a familiar-looking object that resembled the Bone Age Totem during the Regional Tournament in the Eastern Continent.

"Please put your hands on this object and don’t remove it until we tell you to do so." Cang Shicai said to Su Yang.

Su Yang placed his hands on the totem a moment later and patiently waited for the results.

A few seconds later, 18 silver lines appeared and spiraled around the totem.

"E-Eighteen years old? How is that possible?" Cang Shicai immediately doubted the results.

There was simply no way that someone so young could reach the peak of the Heavenly Spirit Realm that requires decades of experience and immense talent!

And if someone like him joins this tournament, it would no longer be a tournament but a one-sided slaughter!

"T-There must have been a mistake— let’s try it again with this one..." Cang Shicai introduced another totem for him to test on, hoping it was really a mistake.

Su Yang didn’t say anything and placed his hands on this new tester.

And to their surprise, the results came back the same.

"E-Eighteen years old... Are you really eighteen years old?" Cang Shicai looked at Su Yang with a dazed face.

"If you don’t believe the results, we can repeat this until you’re satisfied and convinced," Su Yang said to him in a calm voice.

"N-No... That won’t be necessary," Cang Shicai quickly responded.

"However, since the roster is already finalized, we will have to delay the tournament for a couple more hours so that we can fit you inside."

Su Yang shook his head and said, "It’s fine, you don’t need to change anything."

"What do you mean by that?"

Everybody in the room looked at him with their eyebrows raised.

"Since I am a late entry and I don’t want to spend too much time here, let me fight every participant in this tournament." Su Yang said, causing their jaws to drop.

"A-Are you sure about that? There are over ten thousand participants, and half of them are at the Earth Spirit Realm..." Cang Shicai said to him.

"Ten thousand or one hundred thousand— it won’t make any difference." Su Yang said with an overbearing aura surrounding him, dumbfounding the people there.
