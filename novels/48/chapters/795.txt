Chapter 796 - Frozen From Shock and Fear

"T-That’s Ancestor Xian’s ’friend’?"

When the audience looked up and saw Su Yang’s handsome figure, the majority of them were left speechless.

Many of them wondered how someone so young could reach the peak Heavenly Spirit Realm while others wondered how the heavens could allow someone so handsome to exist in this world.

"If I didn’t hear incorrectly, Ancestor Xian said he’s from the Eastern Continent, right? How did he traverse the Jade Sea that even Sovereign Spirit Realm experts don’t dare to challenge?"

"Who knows. Maybe the Eastern Continent has methods that allow them to achieve such a feat."

"If that was the case, why don’t we have more visitors from the Eastern Continent? This is the first time I’ve seen someone from another continent."

While the audience mumbled to each other about Su Yang and the other continents, Su Yang took a deep breath before speaking in a calm voice that echoed in every direction.

"My name is Su Yang and I arrived at the Western Continent only a few days ago. As mentioned by the Nine Immortal Families, I will be challenging every participant in this tournament, and if I lose even a single fight, I shall be parting with three Immortal-grade cultivation techniques to each of the Nine Immortal Families."

Many people in the crowd gasped in shock when they heard Su Yang’s words. Three Immortal-grade cultivation techniques for each family? That’d be 27 cultivation techniques if he loses even a single battle! Does he even have that many cultivation techniques in the first place, or is he simply making things up to force the Nine Immortal Families’ hands and allow him to do this stunt?

Regardless, this is definitely an unprecedented event that might change the Western Continent as a whole!

A few moments after Su Yang gave his introduction, the Patriarchs from the Nine Immortal Families began explaining the rules.

"Although the tournament itself has changed significantly, the rules shall remain the same with a few additions."

"One, you must not kill your opponents. Accidents occur and there’s nothing we can do about that in this eccentric world, but if there’s even a hint that it was done on purpose, we will immediately disqualify you and punish you accordingly afterward."

"Two, you are not allowed to wield powerful spiritual treasures above the Spirit-grade."

"Three, if your opponent surrenders, you are to immediately halt your movements and stop attacking your opponent."

"Four, you are not allowed to consume pills or use any treasures that will enhance your strength or capabilities in any manner."

"Five, if you step outside the stage, you will automatically surrender the fight."

"Six, participant Su Yang will be allowed fifteen minutes of rest after every 100 fights to recover his spiritual energy."

Once the Patriarchs were finished with the rules, one of them turned to look at Su Yang and asked him, "Are you ready to begin?"

Su Yang nodded and said, "Whenever you’re all ready."

"Then we’ll bring in the first participant."

A few moments later, a young man at the third level True Spirit Realm approached the stage with unstable movements, clearly anxious about the situation.

Su Yang raised his eyebrows when he saw this timid-looking Cultivator approaching him, and he said, "You know... While I have plenty of time to spend, I am not someone who likes to drag things around, therefore, I will give you a chance to surrender."

The participant swallowed his nervousness before laughing out loud, "You think I don’t know what you’re trying to do? I don’t care where you’re from, but how dare you mess with the traditions of this tournament! Even if I won’t be able to defeat you, I’ll at least chip away some of your spiritual energy! You may be able to defeat a hundred— even a thousand of us, but I don’t believe you’ll be able to defeat all of us!"

"Is that so?" Su Yang mumbled in a nonchalant voice.

Once the young participant stood on the stage, Su Yang closed his eyes and took a deep breath.

A moment later, he opened his eyes, which flashed with a profound flicker.

BOOM!

An immense and sharp aura suddenly exploded from Su Yang’s body, causing the atmosphere there to change.

"T-This is! Sword Intent?!" Xian Ni narrowed his eyes trying to analyze Su Yang’s Sword Qi.

As for the other people there, they were shocked speechless by the majestic and cold aura around Su Yang, feeling like there was an invisible blade placed directly before their necks despite being so far away from him.

Meanwhile, the young man standing only a couple of meters away from Su Yang had directly fallen unconscious the moment Su Yang’s Sword Qi even got close to him.

However, Su Yang did not retrieve his Sword Qi even when the participant was clearly incapable of continuing the match, and he spoke in a loud but smooth voice, "If you really think this is a battle of endurance, then allow me to open your narrow eyes a bit..."

BOOM!

Su Yang’s aura became even more tyrannical when he released his Sword Will that was combined with his peak Heavenly Spirit Realm cultivation, causing the sky to darken and the atmosphere to tremble, almost like he was trying to flip the world with his aura.

After a moment of deep silence, Su Yang spoke again, "While I won’t purposefully kill anyone, I also cannot promise you that I won’t accidentally kill someone since there are so many of you and it’s hard for me to hold back when I am serious, and I am seriously trying to obtain the Root of Revival. Anyone who dares to try and prevent me from doing so will be eliminated in the swiftest way possible!"

Su Yang’s domineering voice echoed in the coliseum, and every participant there stared at his handsome figure with wide eyes filled with shock, and Su Yang’s figure suddenly began growing larger and larger in these participants’ eyes, indicating how much of a threat Su Yang looked in their eyes right now.

’This young man...’

The Patriarchs of the Nine Immortal Families narrowed their eyes at Su Yang, their bodies frozen from shock and fear before Su Yang’s invincible presence.
