Chapter 537 Another World

"You want to follow Xing’er to the Profound Blossom Sect, father?" Lord Xie looked at him with wide eyes, as Xie Wang, his father, hasn’t really left Snowfall City for many decades.

"Are you against it?" Xie Wang looked at him with narrowed eyes, causing his body to tremble in fear.

Although he may have the appearance of a kind old man right now, Xie Wang used to rule over the Eastern Continent with an iron fist as one of the most powerful Cultivators in this world, not to mention his strict parenting.

However, ever since Xie Xingfang was born, Xie Wang became a kind old man and treated her as though she was a priceless treasure, spoiling her to no end, which would often make Lord Xie jealous.

"I wouldn’t dare to object to you, father. If you wish to accompany Xing’er to the Profound Blossom Sect, then I would no longer have a reason to worry about her safety." Lord Xie said to him with a forced smile.

"Good. Now then, when do you want to leave, Xing’er?" Xie Wang turned to ask her.

"We can leave now," she quickly responded. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

"When do you plan on coming back?" Lord Xie asked her a moment later.

"I don’t know, but if the Moonlight Blades are increasing their activities, then I will probably stay there until things have calmed down," she said after a moment of pondering.

"..."

Lord Xie was speechless, as he didn’t really think that Xie Xingfang would find the Profound Blossom Sect much safer than her own home, a place guarded by an entire army.

Sometime later, Xie Xingfang and Xie Wang left Snowfall City and began their travel to the Profound Blossom Sect.

"Thank you for coming with me, grandfather." Xie Xingfang said to him with a bright smile afterward. "If it weren’t for you, it would’ve required much more effort to change my father’s mind."

Xie Wang laughed and said, "Hahaha... don’t even mention it. I will do anything for my beloved granddaughter."

And he continued, "Anyway, I am really interested in this young man, Su Yang. I have only met him a handful of times, but he always gives me the impression of someone with an almighty and otherworldly background, almost like he does not belong to this world."

"Perhaps you are right, grandfather. Su Yang’s talent is wasted in this small place. If there is another world out there — one that’s even more formidable and profound than this one, who knows how much he’ll grow." Xie Xingfang said with her gaze filled with wonder.

"Another world, huh... That reminds me of Immortal Han Xin, who is said to be from another world." Xie Wang mumbled.

"Is that true, grandfather?" Xie Xingfang’s eyes flickered with interest.

"Yes. It was a rumor that did not linger for long when I was a young man. Xing’er, this universe is unfathomably large, even endless. In such an enormous universe, I wouldn’t be surprised if there were other worlds beyond our heavens and somewhere in the starry sky."

"Ever since I reached the Sovereign Spirit Realm, I cannot help but wonder what’s beyond the heavens. There is this unscratchable itch inside my heart that longs to travel the starry sky, but alas, with my power, it’s only but a childish dream." Xie Wang spoke in a solemn voice as he stared at the sky, seemingly filled with regret.

However, unbeknownst to him, even in the Four Divine Heavens, where all of the most powerful Cultivators in this universe gather, there exists only a handful of experts that have the ability to transverse the starry sky without the assistance of divine Spiritual Treasures.

Meanwhile, back at the Profound Blossom Sect, after explaining the Grand Formation’s functions to the people before him, Su Yang dismissed the disciples, returning them to their training.

"What are the two of you going to do now?" Su Yang asked Bai Lihua and Su Yin afterward.

"If you wish to stay in the Sect for a few days, I will immediately arrange your living quarters."

"Su Yin’s birthday is not until tomorrow, so we will stay here for a day or two at the very least. After that, we will see if we want to remain for any longer." Bai Lihua said to him.

"Elder Brother, can I live with you during my stay here? It’s been a very long time since we have slept in the same room together," Su Yin suddenly said to him with a pleading expression.

"Even if you are my sister, the Yin Yang Pavilion is not a place for guests," he shook his head.

"Please..." Su Yin looked at him with eyes that seemed to be on the verge of tearing up.

"I don’t see any issue with that, Su Yang. Just let her stay with you," Liu Lanzhi suddenly interrupted them.

"Are you sure?" Su Yang asked her.

Liu Lanzhi nodded and spoke, "The Yin Yang Pavilion used to be a sacred building that can only house the Sect Masters, but that kind of tradition is already history. After all, it’s already occupying a few guests at this moment."

As of this moment, not counting Xiao Rong, whose presence is still undisclosed to Liu Lanzhi, two other individuals besides the Sect Masters resided in the Yin Yang Pavilion, and they were Qin Liangyu and Qiuyue.

"Well, since you say so." Su Yang nodded and then said to Su Yin, "Alright, you can stay with me for the time being."

"Thank you, Elder Brother! Thank you, Sect Leader Liu!" Su Yin bowed to her.

"What about you? Do you also want to stay in the Yin Yang Pavilion, Senior Bai?" Liu Lanzhi asked Bai Lihua, who nodded.

"If you don’t mind having me, too."

"Then it’s decided. There are plenty of rooms in the place, so you can pick any room that fancies you."

"Thank you, Sect Leader Liu."

Sometime later, Su Yang brought the guests to the Yin Yang Pavilion.

However, when they arrived, they were blocked by an incredibly beautiful lady standing by the entrance.

When Su Yin and Bai Lihua saw this woman, their eyes widened with shock.

"Y-You are!" Su Yin immediately recognized Qiuyue, as she still owes her an apology for insulting her during her visit to the Su Family many months ago.
