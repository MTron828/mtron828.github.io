"Fathe — Su Yang, I am going to cultivate in my room. If you’re going to cultivate, you can use the other room." Qiuyue suddenly appeared before them and said to him while looking at Tang Lingxi.

Hearing her words, Tang Lingxi showed a smile and spoke, "Fortunately for you but unfortunately for me, I won’t be cultivating with him, so you don’t have to worry about that."

"Eh?" Qiuyue looked at her with a surprised face. And why wouldn’t she cultivate with him? One would expect the two of them to embrace each other after being separated for so long, especially when they are lovers.

"Because this is not my body," said Tang Lingxi. "As much as I want to undress him right now and have some fun with his body, I have made a promise with Hong Yu’er that I would not do anything that would defile her body while I am borrowing her body."

"It’s regrettable, but I will have to wait for you to return to the Four Divine Heavens before we can do anything too passionate," she said to Su Yang, who calmly shook his head after hearing her words.

"It’s fine. I am satisfied with just being able to speak with you again. Even if we cultivate right now, it won’t feel the same, since your current body won’t be able to handle most of it anyway," said Su Yang.

"..."

Qiuyue said nothing else and disappeared into her room a few moments later.

"She calls you ’Father’? How cute." Tang Lingxi chuckled after Qiuyue left.

"Well, I am something like a father figure to her," he said with a smile.

"The Sacred Moon Temple is one of the most secluded places in the Four Divine Heavens. It’s a miracle that you were even allowed to visit that place, much less make love with the Goddess of the Moon, Yuehai."

"It was only pure coincidence that I found a technique that allowed people with special bloodlines to become even more powerful. If not for the technique, the Sacred Moon Temple would not have even looked at me."

After a moment of silence, Tang Lingxi spoke, "Hey, darling. Are you planning on accepting Qiuyue into our family?"

"If that’s what she wishes, I will gladly accept her." Su Yang nodded without hesitation.

"I shouldn’t have asked a question with an obvious answer." Tang Lingxi shook her head, and she continued, "Then are you prepared to fight the Sacred Moon Temple for her? You should know that they will never allow their special bloodline to leave their home, especially if she’s Yuehai’s daughter, whose bloodline is the purest of them all."

"Of course. Not only will I fight for Qiuyue, but I will fight for everyone in the Sacred Moon Temple. This curse that binds their fate — I will crush it with my own hands." Su Yang said while tightly gripping his hands into fists.

"Then when that time comes and you need help, the Asura God Clan will gladly assist you." Tang Lingxi said.

However, Su Yang shook his head and said, "Anything the Asura God Clan is involved in, the Heavenly Emperor will take notice. I cannot have my existence revealed to him — at least not until I am confident that I can protect my family even with the Heavenly Emperor at my doorsteps. Furthermore, this is my own revenge. My wrath will not subdue unless I personally avenge Yuehai."

"How responsible of you." Tang Lingxi chuckled.

Su Yang and Tang Lingxi continued to chat with each other for the remainder of the night.

The following morning, Su Yang, Tang Lingxi, and Qiuyue prepared to return to the Boar Tribe’s settlement.

"Hey, darling." Tang Lingxi called out to him before they left the flying ship.

"What is it?"

Just as Su Yang turned around, Tang Lingxi took a step towards him and gave him a gentle kiss on the cheeks.

"Since we cannot cultivate now, this will have to suffice," she said with a smile.

"..."

Qiuyue was speechless. Her image of the Asura God Clan was quickly crumbling right before her eyes.

In her mind, the Asura God Clan is a place filled with criminals that will do anything they can to offend the Heavenly Emperor and even defy heaven itself. Hell, even though she has never met Tang Lingxi before coming here, she has heard plenty of terrifying stories about her. However, this exact Tang Lingxi, who is supposedly the princess of such a vicious clan and one of the most dangerous individuals in the Four Divine Heavens, is acting no different than any ordinary caring wife right now.

"If you’re jealous, why don’t you kiss him, too?"

Seeing Qiuyue stare at her with wide eyes, Tang Lingxi said to her with a teasing voice.

"I-I don’t know what you are talking about!" Qiuyue’s face quickly flushed before she turned around and began walking away.

"Were people from the Sacred Moon Clan always this bashful? All of the ones I have met that came from that place are always acting haughty and prideful." Tang Lingxi said.

"She’s definitely a special little princess, and you can thank her mother, Yuehai, for that." Su Yang said with a smile.

Tang Lingxi chuckled before following Qiuyue.

"Hey, Qiuyue." Tang Lingxi suddenly called for her after catching up.

"What is it, Senior Tang?" Qiuyue spoke in a respectful tone.

"Senior Tang? You can drop the formality. Just call me Sister Lingxi."

"But..." Qiuyue immediately hesitated. No matter the circumstances, she was standing before one of the most powerful figures in the Four Divine Heavens, and she did not dare to show even the slightest disrespect to Tang Lingxi.

"Su Yang told me about your relationship last night, so it’s not an exaggeration to say that we belong to the same family now." Tang Lingxi said. "Although we are still engaged, I consider us husband and wife already, and you should do the same."

"That’s a little..." Qiuyue was dumbfounded. Why is Tang Lingxi telling her all of this? Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

"You should also stop acting so bashful. If you continue acting like that, you will never beat the other girls."

"The other girls?" Qiuyue lifted an eyebrow, looking puzzled. Why would she need to defeat other girls?

"I don’t know what you know about Su Yang, but you clearly don’t know very much about him. If you are serious about following him forever, you will need to prepare yourself in the future when the two of you return to the Four Divine Heavens." Tang Lingxi said to her with a mysterious smile.

"The two of you are in a very peculiar situation right now, and if you don’t take advantage of your time with him right now, you will deeply regret not spending more time with him once you leave this place with him. This is my first advice for you as your Senior Sister, and it won’t be the last."

"..."

Qiuyue was speechless, as she couldn’t fully comprehend Tang Lingxi’s words that sounded almost like a warning.

’I will regret not spending time with him? Why would she say something like that?’ Qiuyue pondered as they approached the Boar Tribe’s settlement.
