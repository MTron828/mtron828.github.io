Chapter 485 Cultivation Inside The Sun Family“s Home

"Ahhh... ohhh... mmm~"

Sun Jingjing moaned in a suppressed voice as she cultivated with Su Yang on her personal bed in her darkroom.

"Are you really not going to contain the noises in this room? Ahhhh~" Sun Jingjing asked him as she was getting close to not being able to hold her voice back.

"What’s wrong? Weren’t you confident that you wouldn’t make any sounds just a few minutes ago?" Su Yang teased her, and he even began shaking his hips with more intensity afterward.

"Ahhh—!" Sun Jingjing released a sharp moan for half a second before she forcefully covered her face with the soft pillow underneath her.

"Ahhh! Ahhhh! Ahhhhhh!" Sun Jingjing used this chance to moan without any restrictions.

"That’s cheating." Su Yang suddenly grabbed the pillow and tossed it to the back of the bed and said with a smile, "It sounds better when you don’t cover it."

"Ahhh~ Su Yang, you’re teasing me too much!" Sun Jingjing bit her lips trying to contain her own moaning.

Suddenly, the sound of footsteps could be heard approaching their room, and there was even a small light from a lantern floating outside.

When Sun Jingjing heard the footprints, her heart began beating like war drums, and her face flushed with redness.

"S-Su Yang! There’s someone outside!" Sun Jingjing whispered in a slightly nervous voice. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The sound of the footsteps grew closer and closer to their room — until the light from the lantern hovered directly before their room.

"Su Yang, are you already asleep?" Sun Ren’s voice suddenly resounded from outside their room.

’It’s Mother!’ Sun Jingjing turned to look at her mother’s silhouette behind the doors’ design that was only covered by a thin layer of paper.

"Don’t say anything, Su Yang!" Sun Jingjing quickly whispered to him.

However, Su Yang showed a grin on his face before opening his mouth, "I am not asleep yet. Is there a problem?"

Sun Jingjing looked at Su Yang with wide eyes. She would not be able to face her mother directly anymore if she walks in on their cultivation right now.

"If you don’t mind, may I come inside to talk? This is about my daughter..." she said in a worried tone.

"Is this about her accepting the Mu Family’s marriage proposal?" Su Yang spoke in a relaxed tone, nothing that would hint his current situation.

"Unfortunately, yes..."

"Then you don’t need to worry. As her mother, you should trust your own daughter. I’m sure she has something in mind. I am also cultivating right now, so I apologize for speaking with you behind a door like this."

"You were cultivating?! I am so sorry for disturbing you! I will immediately leave you alone, Su Yang." Sun Ren panicked after realizing that he was cultivating, as it was common knowledge to never disturb a Cultivator while they were cultivating, as that could affect their cultivation.

"Don’t worry, I can talk and cultivate at the same time."

"Even if that’s the case, I cannot continue to disturb you. Let us continue this conversation in the future when you are not cultivating. Good night." Sun Ren said before walking away.

Sun Jingjing released a relieved sigh after the atmosphere returned to being silent and peaceful.

"You are really daring, Su Yang! What would you do if she saw us in this situation?" Sun Jingjing shook her head.

"I would’ve greeted her with a smile and continued." Su Yang chuckled, leaving her speechless.

Meanwhile, after walking away from Su Yang’s room, Sun Ren returned to her own room, which was only down the hall.

"That was fast. Was he asleep?" Sun Quan asked her afterward.

She shook her head and spoke, "No, he was awake, but he was also cultivating, so I quickly returned."

"Huh...? He’s cultivating...?" Sun Quan looked at her with wide eyes.

"That’s what he said. What’s wrong?" Sun Ren raised an eyebrow after seeing Sun Quan’s dazed face, completely forgetting the fact that Su Yang was a dual cultivator.

"Su Yang... he’s also from the Profound Blossom Sect, right? If he’s cultivating right now, does that mean he’s... with our daughter... right now?" Sun Quan did not forget about this and spoke in a dumbfounded voice.

Sun Ren’s eyes widened with shock upon realizing this fact.

"Oh my god! I should have realized this when she said that he’ll be staying in her room! Does this mean I was very close to witnessing my daughter in the act with Su Yang just now?! No wonder why I heard some weird noises coming from their room! I thought I was only imagining things because it was very subtle!"

Sun Ren’s entire body staggered backward until she tripped and fell to the ground on her buttocks, her face pale with disbelief.

"She’s an adult now... and she’s also a disciple of the Profound Blossom Sect, so it’s not weird for her to be doing something like that with him." Sun Quan sighed in a defeated voice.

"B-But what about her engagement with the Mu Family?! Why did she accept the proposal if she planned on sleeping with Su Yang tonight?! Even if she’s a disciple from the Profound Blossom Sect, she cannot sleep with another man now that she’s engaged! If the public learns of this, our daughter and the entire Sun Family will be condemned for life!" Sun Ren exclaimed.

"I don’t know what she’s planning, but we should act as though this never happened." Sun Quan shook his head. "Luckily for us, the servants are not allowed in this area, or that could’ve been very problematic."

"I still can’t believe that she would have the guts to do such acts when she knows very well that we live only a few rooms down the hall from her!" Sun Ren stood up and rubbed her temples, feeling exhausted for no reason.

Meanwhile, inside Sun Jingjing’s room, completely oblivious to Sun Jingjing, a pair of cat eyes silently watched her cultivation with Su Yang, its gaze filled with interest and wonder.
