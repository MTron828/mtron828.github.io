Chapter 620 - Preperations

"Now that you have accepted the flame controlling technique, I won’t let you quit even if you want to," said Su Yang in a calm voice.

"This disciple wouldn’t dare even if she were to be tortured by the Master..." Cai Yan said with a smile on her pretty face.

"Anyway, you can start studying the technique now. If there’s anything that you don’t understand, you can ask me," Su Yang said.

"Yes, Master." Cai Yan nodded before she began looking through the flame controlling technique.

Meanwhile, Su Yang turned his attention to Wang Shuren and asked her, "Do you still want to have unique alchemy flames after realizing the truth?"

She quickly nodded without hesitation, "Yes! So what if I will have to work a little bit harder than other people? It’s all worth it if I can become a better Alchemist in the end!"

"...Now that I think about it, you never told me about your reason for becoming an Alchemist," he said to her. "If you don’t mind, tell me about it." Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

"Well, you never asked me about it," she said with a smile before she continued, "I have always wanted to become an Alchemist for as long as I can remember, but I cannot actually recall the exact reason why I picked this path. I guess it’s one of those situations where you don’t remember why you’re doing what you’ve been doing for many years, but oddly enough, I don’t find anything wrong with that, as my passion for Alchemy is as real."

"However, despite my dream to become a top Alchemist, I was only able to enter an average sect like the Burning Lotus Sect and became a sect elder after many years of effort, whilst my reputation as an Alchemist was nearly nonexistence compared to people like Senior Zeng, who is renowned throughout the entire continent."

"If I had never met you, or you did not choose me but someone else as your assistant, I would probably still be working in the Burning Lotus Sect Auction House as a mere manager and without any real reputation." Wang Shuren sighed.

"Now that I think about it, you never told me your reason for picking me," she suddenly asked him. "Surely, there are countless people who would qualify more than me if you searched."

Su Yang smiled and said, "Well, you never asked me."

And then he continued, "As for why I picked you... there is really no reason, as it was mostly on a whim and you were the first person I came across."

"Is that so...? So it was only a coincidence, huh?" Wang Shuren showed a bitter smile after hearing his words.

However, Su Yang continued, "While it’s true that it was mostly on a whim, there were a few reasons that caused me to actually go through with it, as I don’t usually move just on a ’whim’."

"Really? What is it?" Wang Shuren’s eyes immediately glowed with anticipation.

"Well, first and foremost, you are quite the stunning woman, and it only makes sense for a man such as myself to want someone like you around my side."

"..." Wang Shuren’s face flushed with redness after hearing his words, but it was not because she was feeling bashful, as she has done many things with him that were more embarrassing than a few words.

In fact, the cause of her redness was due to the other people in the room. What will he do if they realize their real relationship? Since intimate relationsh.i.p.s between Masters and Disciples are frowned upon in the cultivation world, it would be better for their relationship to remain hidden.

"..."

Of course, Senior Zeng, Cai Yan, and Luo Yixiao were staring at them with wide and suspicious eyes, wondering if they were really in that kind of relationship.

’I didn’t expect the Master to be the flirty type... even towards his own disciple...’ Cai Yan thought to herself, wondering if she might receive the same treatment in the future once they know each other better.

"Another reason why I picked you was because of your smell." Su Yang continued, dumbfounding her.

"My...my smell?" Wang Shuren raised her eyebrows awkwardly.

"The smell of medicine was abundant on you when I first met you; it’s a smell only those who are always surrounded by medicine would emit, telling me that you are at least somewhat serious when it comes to alchemy."

"Well, there are other reasons, but does it really matter why I chose you at this point?" Su Yang shrugged.

"I guess not..."

"Anyway, you can continue your routine. If you need any ’assistance’, you can find me in the other room, where I will be cultivating." Su Yang said.

"And this goes to everyone here. If you need help with something, just knock on the door and I’ll help you. Don’t be afraid to bother me because that’s what it means to be a Master."

Su Yang then left the pill room and went inside Wang Shuren’s bedroom, where he sat on the floor and began searching inside his storage ring.

A few seconds later, he looked at the red peanut-sized seed sitting on his palm.

’I should start preparing for when I finally consume this Hellfire Seed,’ he thought.

’While I won’t have any problems consuming this thing, it’s what happens after I swallow this Hellfire Seed that...’

Su Yang suddenly sighed in a low voice, "Will there even be enough partners for me to exhaust the overwhelming amount of Yang Qi I will have afterward?"

This is actually his first time consuming a Hellfire Seed, and he was worried that the disciples from the Profound Blossom Sect wouldn’t be nearly enough to satisfy his l.u.s.t after he consumes the seed.

"The Hellfire Seed should be barely enough for me to reach the peak of the Heavenly Spirit Realm, and if I am going to return to the Divine Heavens in two years, I must increase my cultivation base as much as possible before then." Su Yang stared at the Hellfire Seed with a dazed expression.

"Two years... just wait two more years for me and I will return to your sides..." he mumbled in a longing voice, and he remained sitting there for a long time with a dazed face, seemingly in deep thoughts.
