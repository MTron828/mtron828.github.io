Chapter 748 But I Am Your Man

Another week has passed since Su Yang’s previous lecture with Bai Lihua, thus he made his way back to the Heavenly Swan Sect to give Bai Lihua her 3rd lecture.

"Welcome, Su Yang," Bai Lihua greeted him at the door with an unusually bright expression on her beautiful face, and even someone blind would be able to tell her cheerful mood just by hearing her delightful voice.

"You seem happy, did something happen?" Su Yang entered her house with a smile.

"Of course! I have finally managed to master all Elementary-grade pills! Look! All of these are high-quality pills!" Bai Lihua handed him a storage pouch that contained over 100 high-quality Elementary-grade pills.

"I see... Congratulations, now we can finally start working on Profound-grade pills. However, before we start on those, I want you to learn the flame controlling technique I’d taught the others." Su Yang then handed her the technique.

"You can start studying it now; I’ll be back soon."

"Huh? Where are you going?" Bai Lihua asked him.

"I promised you that I’d improve the formation protecting the Heavenly Swan Sect, right? Well, I am thinking about fulfilling that promise right now," he said to her.

"Oh! I nearly forgot about that! Do you need any help? If you need spirit stones, the Heavenly Swan Sect should be able to spare about 50 million spirit stones to strengthen the formation..."

"50 million spirit stones? You’d need at least 150 million spirit stones for what I am about to do. However, you don’t have to worry about paying me 150 million spirit stones since the Profound Blossom Sect will foot the bill," Su Yang said to her.

"150 million spirit stones?! Are you sure? Even if you can afford it, allow me to at least relieve some of that burden for you! After all, this is my Heavenly Swan Sect!" Bai Lihua insisted.

"You may be the Sect Master of this place, but I am your man, so I will still foot the bill," Su Yang said with a calm expression on his face.

"Huh? What did you just say?" Bai Lihua’s eyes immediately widened after hearing his words with a gawking expression on her beautiful face.

Did Su Yang just call himself her ’man’? Surely, she must have misheard him. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

"I also promised you that I’d give an answer to your feelings if you finished all of the Elementary-grade pills, right? Or do you not like this answer?" Su Yang said with a smile on his face.

"You... does that mean..." Bai Lihua was still in disbelief and asked him for confirmation.

"I’ll give you a better answer once I return. For now, you should focus on the technique," Su Yang said before waving goodbye and leaving Bai Lihua alone.

"W-Why does he keep leaving me hanging like this?! Does he enjoy teasing me that much?!" Bai Lihua cried out loud after Su Yang left.

However, despite how Su Yang was dealing with the situation, Bai Lihua didn’t feel annoyed or angry. In fact, the anticipation was only making her more excited.

’What is this feeling? I have never felt anything like this before!’ Bai Lihua wondered to herself as she returned to her own room to study the technique Su Yang just handed her.

Meanwhile, Su Yang went to the center of the Heavenly Swan Sect, attracting countless gazes from the female disciples within the sect.

"Hey, look at that. Isn’t that Su Yang? What’s he doing here?"

"It really is Su Yang! Do you think he’s here about ’that’ event?"

"So that’s what Su Yang looks like, huh? This is actually my first time seeing him and I have to say that he’s definitely the most handsome man I’ve seen to date!"

"Me too! I was debating about whether I should participate in ’that’ event, but after seeing his handsome face and noble aura, I have decided that I will also participate!"

"Not only is he exceedingly handsome but he’s also extremely talented! What more do you need from him?"

"I heard he’s also very skilled in the bed as a Dual Cultivator! I am going to see for myself whether that is true or not!"

It was not just the disciples that gossiped about Su Yang after seeing him, as the sect elders at the Heavenly Swan Sect were also glaring at Su Yang with a yearning gaze.

"What do you think he’s doing here?"

"Why don’t you go ahead and ask him?"

"You want me to talk to him? No way! Even though he’s younger than me, our status is too far apart!"

"We can just follow him and see what he’s up to." One of the sect elders suggested.

Thus, the disciples and sect elders decided to follow Su Yang.

And since Su Yang didn’t tell them to leave, they continued to follow him.

By the time Su Yang reached the center of the sect, there were over a thousand disciples and sect elders following him.

Once he was at the center, Su Yang sat down on the ground and retrieved a few items before placing them on the floor in front of him.

"That looks like a scroll... What’s he doing in the middle of the sect?"

The disciples and sect elders were curious about his intentions, but they didn’t dare to disturb him and watched from a distance.

After writing a few things on the scrolls, Su Yang stood up and retrieved a couple of storage rings, and he proceeded to dump spirit stones on the floor like he was throwing out the trash, shocking the disciples and sect elders watching.

"W-What in heaven’s name is he doing?! That’s millions of spirit stones he’s throwing on the floor!"

The disciples and sect elders swallowed nervously while salivating at the mountains of spirit stones that were piling on the floor at an insane rate. However, not a single disciple there dared to step forward to grab the spirit stones even if some of them rolled to their feet. After all, a few spirit stones weren’t worth offending someone like Su Yang and potentially losing their chance to cultivate with him!
