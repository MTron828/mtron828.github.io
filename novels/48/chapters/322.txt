After a good moment of pondering, Liu Lanzhi nodded, agreeing to Su Yang’s bet. \"You better not go back on your words when you lose!\"

Su Yang smiled and said, \"Don’t worry, you won’t get the chance to ask me anything, anyways.\"

\"...\"

Not just Liu Lanzhi but the other girls looked at his confident face with a doubting expression, wondering if he’s going to do anything crazy.

\"If you cause any trouble for the Xie Family, it will count as your loss.\" Liu Lanzhi added just in case.

\"That’s fine.\"

\"Hmph!\"

After their agreement, the Profound Blossom Sect continued to wait for their turn to register for the tournament.

Of course, because their group consisted of top beauties that are rarely seen in this continent, the Profound Blossom Sect attracted countless gazes from the surrounding like usual.

\"Good heavens, to have so many beauties in one place, the male disciples in that place must be smiling every day even in their sleep!\"

After some time, when they could no longer hold their curiosity, a few gentlemen approached the Profound Blossom Sect.

\"These beautiful fairies, why don’t we have some conversations while we wait?\"

\"Forget him. Only a disciple from a third-rate Sect. I am a Core Disciple from the Nine Nether Sect.\"

\"Our Thunder Golem Sect is at the very front of the line. If you’d like, we can make some space for you, fairies.\"

Disciples from multiple sects tried to impress the Profound Blossom Sect with some even flaunting their backgrounds.

\"...\"

However, the disciples from the Profound Blossom Sect remained unimpressed by these people, even looking somewhat annoyed by their approach.

\"Zero points.\" One of the female disciples shook her head.

\"A bunch of toads without any elegance, get out of here.\"

When the courters received nothing but curses from the Profound Blossom Sect, they returned to their Sects with embarrassed faces. However, this did not keep others from trying. In fact, the more the girls from the Profound Blossom Sect rejected company, the more others wanted to try their chances.

Meanwhile, the Elders and Seniors leading their own group were impressed by the Profound Blossom Sect’s overall prowess.

\"Where are they from? Almost everybody in that group is at the True Spirit Realm! Two of them are even in the Earth Spirit Realm! How could such a powerhouse remain unknown?!\"

\"Wait! Isn’t that the Profound Blossom Sect?! Impossible! I thought that they had disbanded after that incident! How are they here?!\"

\"Profound Blossom Sect? How come I have never heard of them?\"

\"They are just a third-rate Sect from the Eastern Region! In fact, all of their disciples were driven away by the Million Snakes Sect, whom they have offended!\"

\"Third-rate Sect? Who are you trying to fool? What kind of third-rate Sect could possibly raise such excellent disciples?\"

\"I’m speaking the truth! They only have high cultivation bases because of their unique cultivation methods. In truth, the only thing impressive about them is their cultivation bases. Their combat skills are laughable! Even a disciple at the Profound Spirit Realm from my Sect could easily defeat a peak True Spirit Realm disciple from their place!\"

\"What is this unique cultivation method that you are speaking of?\" Someone suddenly asked.

\"Dual cultivation, of course! Although those girls may look pretty and pure, the disciples from that place are all sluts! Who knows how many different partners they have!\"

Once the people there started learning of the Profound Blossom Sect and their true nature, fewer and fewer people approached them. And in a matter of minutes, no longer did anyone approach them.

In fact, people even began looking at them with disdain.

\"Aiya, I can’t believe that I had tried to court these impure things just now...\"

\"A bunch of soiled flowers, what a pity.\"

However, despite the disdain being thrown at them, the disciples from the Profound Blossom Sect remained unaffected and calm, almost like they didn’t hear anything.

Liu Lanzhi smiled inwardly when she saw the disciples’ tranquility, silently praising their ability to tolerate the insults.

Of course, if they couldn’t even handle such criticisms, none of them would have had the resolve to join the Profound Blossom Sect.

\"Once this is all over and we return to the hotel, why don’t we all have some fun together — in the same room, of course. I have some new techniques that I’d like to share with you all.\" Su Yang suddenly said in a voice that was loud enough for the surrounding people to hear.

Although the girls were slightly dazed by his words, they all nodded, before laughing with grace.

As for the surrounding people, they all looked at Su Yang with a frown on their faces, their gazes filled with anger and envy.

\"I swear that if I am fortunate enough to encounter that bastard on the stage, I will fucking kill him!\"

\"Good words! I will also swear to kill him if we meet on the stage!\"

Feeling provoked by Su Yang’s mere existence, especially his superior appearance that silently mocked every male there, dozens of people there swore to kill him if they enter the same stage during the tournament.

Of course, the tournament prohibits intentional manslaughter. However, on a stage where everyone will be displaying their strongest technique, accidents are bound to happen.

A few hours of standing around later, it was finally the Profound Blossom Sect’s turn to register.

\"Sect name and amount of participants?\" The worker behind the counter spoke to them the moment they approached him. \"The maximum participants each Sect can have is 20, and one must be above the Profound Spirit Realm and below the age of 30 to qualify as a participant.\" Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

\"Profound Blossom Sect. 11 participants!\"

\"Noted. You may enter the hall for the exam.\" The worker handed Liu Lanzhi a medallion before opening the gates to the large stadium behind him for them.

\"Let’s head inside for the exam,\" said Liu Lanzhi.

\"We still have to take an exam?\" One of the disciples asked.

\"It’s only an examination to see if you are truly qualified to participate,\" said Liu Lanzhi as she led them into the stadium. \"It’s purpose is obviously to weed out the liars. Don’t worry, it won’t take more than a minute for each person.\"
