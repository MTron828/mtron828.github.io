Chapter 830 - Broadening Their Views

Hearing Lord Xie’s words, Su Yang shook his head and said, "I’m only here to deliver a few things. As for the teleportation formation, it doesn’t matter to me since I won’t be here in the near future."

"Oh, right..." Lord Xie nodded.

"Wait... What do you mean by that, Su Yang? That you won’t be here in the near future?" Su Xun suddenly asked him after hearing such puzzling words.

Su Yang smiled and said, "It’s exactly as it sounds. I’m leaving this world in less than a year."

"Huh?"

Everybody in the room except Lord Xie raised their eyebrows in a puzzled manner, as this is their first time hearing about Su Yang’s departure. Furthermore, they aren’t aware of Su Yang’s background and the Divine Heavens.

Seeing their puzzled looks, Su Yang then said, "Well, it’s something like ascension. I’ll be ascending to a different world in less than a year."

"W-Wait a minute! Ascension?! A different world?! How can you drop such a bomb so casually?!" A middle-aged man suddenly stood up and exclaimed.

Su Yang turned to look at this middle-aged man that he wasn’t familiar with.

"The Long Family, huh? If you have any questions, go ahead and ask them. I’m feeling generous today." Su Yang said.

"What do you mean by ascension? And what’s this about a different world?" The middle-aged man from the Long Family immediately asked.

Su Yang quickly responded, "If you think this is the only world in this boundless universe then you’re very narrow-minded. There are other worlds beyond the sky, and the place I’ll be going to is called the Divine Heavens."

"As for ascension, well, it’s not really ascension, since it’s more like teleportation." Su Yang said, and he continued, "In the Southern Continent, there is a silver mirror that might lead you to another cultivation world known as the Divine Heavens. In that place, Cultivators are much stronger and the world is countless times larger than this world. If I have to describe that place, it’d be the ’real cultivation world’ while this place is only some backwater cultivation world."

Su Yang explained to the Four Great Families about the Divine Heavens.

The Four Great Families’ listened to Su Yang with gawking looks on their faces, looking like they’d just heard their dead ancestors speak from their grave, not daring to believe their ears.

"How can such a place possibly exist?! And how would you know about it if you’ve never been there!" Madam Xiang from the Xiang Family stood up and pointed at Su Yang and continued, "You’re making all of this shit up!"

Su Yang looked at her with a nonchalant expression on his face and said, "Whether you want to believe it or not is entirely up to you. I am just trying to broaden your views."

"Anyways, I’ll leave the matter regarding the teleportation formation to you. I have an event to prepare for." Su Yang said as he tossed a couple of storage rings at Lord Xie.

"There are over 10,000 Heaven Transcendence Pills, 25,000 Earth Advancement Pills, and some other pills inside those storage rings. It’ll last you for many decades if you use and sell them sparingly."

The Four Great Families swallowed nervously after hearing Su Yang’s words, and they turned to look at the storage rings in Lord Xie’s grasp with itchy fingers, as they could only imagine how much wealth these storage rings were worth.

Sometime later, Su Yang left the place and went to spend some more time with Xie Xingfang and the twins.

"Y-Your Majesty! What Su Yang said regarding the Divine Heavens— is that true?!" The Patriarch of the Long Family asked Lord Xie after Su Yang left.

Although Lord Xie had no solid evidence that the Divine Heavens exist, he believed Su Yang to the point where even if Su Yang told him that the heavens might fall in a week, he would not doubt it.

"Yes, it’s real." Lord Xie said.

"Unbelievable..."

The Four Great Families were in disbelief. If such a mythical place existed, how come nobody knew about it until today? And how did Su Yang learn of the Divine Heavens? He even sounded like he’d been there before.

A few hours later, after their meeting with Lord Xie, the Four Great Families returned to their own home.

After returning home, the Four Great Families began spreading news of the Divine Heavens across the entire Eastern Continent, greatly shocking everybody regardless of their background and position. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

"Did you hear?! Apparently, there are other worlds out there besides this one!"

"Of course! Everybody from their ancestors to their current generation has been talking about it ever since the Four Great Families revealed its existence! Do you think such a place really exists? How did they find out?"

"I don’t know man, it sounds too crazy to be true. I mean, another world where Cultivators beyond the Sovereign Spirit Realm exists? Where the world is many times larger than our own world? It sounds like the fantasy of a madman!"

"But all Four Great Families revealed this information! Why would they reveal something like this if they don’t believe it truly exists?"

In just a single day, nearly everybody in the Eastern Continent has heard of the Divine Heavens.

The following day, another massive ripple spread around the Eastern Continent.

"Big news, everybody! Big news! The Four Great Families just reveal more information regarding the Divine Heavens! Looks like Su Yang from the Profound Blossom Sect will be going to this world in less than a year!"

"What?!"

This sudden information shocked the people even more.

"Does this mean Su Yang will no longer be in this world after a year?"

"That actually makes a lot of sense. If you consider his current standing, this world is simply too small for someone like him, who will be entering the Sovereign Spirit Realm in just a couple of months."

"Good lord, maybe this ’Divine Heavens’ place really exists!"

Thus, the Divine Heavens became a hot topic around the world, and it would remain that way for many years to come.
