Chapter 937 Summoning the God of Alchemy

"How are you going to summon her with these ingredients?" Luo Ziyi asked him with her eyebrows slightly raised.

"I am going to concoct a pill, and hopefully she notices it and comes here to investigate," he said.

"Huh?" Luo Ziyi still doesn’t understand how that is going to summon the God of Alchemy.

"You see, the God of Alchemy has a godlike sense of smell when it comes to ingredients, so no matter where she is in this world, she should be able to smell someone concocting pills in her supposedly secret home."

"Once she smells it, she will immediately come here to investigate it—"

"Provided that she’s actually in this world..." Luo Ziyi interrupted.

"Yes, but I am certain that she’s in here. Although I wasn’t certain before, I am now after coming here."

"What makes you so confident?" she then asked.

"The ingredients have recently been taken care of, and that is only possible if the God of Alchemy is here, and I doubt she had hired someone to take care of the medicine for her."

"She’s incredibly stingy and selfish when it comes to her ingredients— almost childishly so, and if you touch her ingredients without receiving her permission, she will make a commotion."

"Uhhh..."

Hearing his words, Luo Ziyi’s gaze turned to look at the ingredients in his hands and said, "What happens if someone takes her ingredients without permission?"

Su Yang laughed and said, "Then that person will probably die a horrible death."

And he continued, "Don’t worry, nothing will happen to me— I hope."

"You hope?"

"Whether she’s in a good mood or not, I guess."

"Anyways, I am going to start concocting the pill now..."

He then paused for a moment and looked at Luo Ziyi with a mysterious look on his face.

"What is it?" Luo Ziyi felt a chill go down her spine when she saw his look.

"Nothing," he said before sitting down on the ground and retrieving a cauldron from his storage ring a moment later.

"..."

Luo Ziyi frowned, feeling something obnoxious in the air for some reason.

’What is he hiding from me?’ she wondered inwardly as Su Yang prepared the cauldron. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

However, Luo Ziyi would soon find out why Su Yang was hiding from her, and it came sooner than she’d expected.

Once Su Yang heated the cauldron, he began tossing half of the ingredients he’d gathered inside it, and they were all ingredients with weird shapes that she had never seen before.

A few moments after Su Yang began concocting the pill, a foul smell suddenly assaulted Luo Ziyi’s nose that caused her to start gagging.

After feeling like she had her breath taken away, she exclaimed with a shocked expression on her face, "What the heck is that foulness?! I have never smelled anything this disgusting before! Not even impurities smell this bad!"

Su Yang burst out laughing after hearing her words.

"I am creating the world’s stinkiest pill."

"Damn it, Su Yang! How could you create such an abomination without warning me first?! I will definitely have nightmares about this later! And there’s a good chance that I will never forget this smell for the rest of my life!" Luo Ziyi immediately covered herself with spiritual energy, blocking the foul smell from entering her nose, yet she could still somehow smell it.

"Is it really that bad? I have forgotten about it." Su Yang said with a smile on his face.

Of course, he’d sealed his sense of smell before he started concocting this stink bomb.

Luo Ziyi had a strong urge to give the back of Su Yang’s head a powerful slap, but she resisted.

"Ziyi, can you spread the smell?" Su Yang asked her a minute later when the foulness reached its peak.

"Won’t the God of Alchemy kill you later for stinking up her precious paradise?"

"Perhaps," he said with a smile on his face, seemingly without a care in the world.

Luo Ziyi shook her head and waved her sleeves, creating a powerful gust of wind that spread the foul smell even further.

"I won’t protect you if the God of Alchemy decides to kill you since you deserve it," she said to him afterward.

"I look forward to it," he chuckled.

Meanwhile, somewhere within the Medicine Paradise, a small figure laid on the ground curled up like a ball while surrounded by ingredients, seemingly deep asleep.

This small figure was actually a little girl— one that didn’t even look to be in her teenage years.

She had a delicate and small face, her skin was as smooth as jade, and its texture was white like snow.

This incredibly beautiful little girl looked incredibly innocent at glance and would, without a doubt, grow up to be a beautiful woman.

However, her eyes suddenly snapped open when a certain foul smell assaulted her nose.

This little girl then slowly sat up and looked in a certain direction with a deep frown and vicious expression on her delicate face, looking like someone who was prepared to torture someone before killing them.

"Who dares..."

She muttered in a chilling voice that would freeze anyone that heard it.

She then stood up and began flying towards the source of the smell.

"Uhh... I think she’s coming..." Luo Ziyi said when she sensed killing intent suddenly appeared very far away from their location.

"Really? That’s great."

Su Yang then opened the cauldron and tossed into it the remainder of the ingredients.

A white mist then appeared from the cauldron, quickly cleansing the foul smell in the air.

Of course, Luo Ziyi wasn’t aware that he was actually cleaning up the air since she had her sense of smell still sealed.

"Now we wait." Su Yang said as he laid on the ground in a relaxed manner.

Luo Ziyi, however, remained alert, as she was worried that the God of Alchemy might actually attack them on sight due to Su Yang’s actions.

"I swear, Su Yang, if I die because of this, I will haunt you in your next life!" Luo Ziyi said to him.
