Chapter 1022: I Am Xiao Yang

"My name is Yang Kai, and I came from a middle-class family in Spirit Heaven...”

The disciple used all three minutes to introduce himself, and he would talk about his hobbies and what he was talented in.

Despite his calm voice, everyone could tell that he was nervous from his stiff body movements, which isn’t an uncommon emotion during this kind of event.

Hawever, even then, someone from the audience approached him and offered to be his partner, which he gladly accepted.

"What are you going to say when you’re up there?” Li Sang asked them while the disciples continued to introduce themselves one by one.

"Fuck, I forgot everything I wanted to say!” Ji Ning began tapping his legs in a nervous manner.

"I’ll just say whatever comes to mind." Wu Bing shrugged.

"What about you, newcomer, Disciple Xiao?"

"Who knows." Su Yang also shrugged, but he appeared more nonchalant than Wu Bing.

"By the way, what are your numbers?" Wu Bing asked.

He showed them his card.

’154’

Ji Ning showed his card that said, ’311’

Fuck, I got 99. That means I go ahead of you two."

They tumed to look at Su Yang’s card.

"696? What a lucky number you have there. You’re practically last!" Li Sang said.

Sometime later, Li Sang approached the front of the platform when it was his turn.

He took a deep breath and began speaking in a confident voice, "My name is Li Sang, and I am 25 years old! If you wane to feel warm and cuddle with this round body during cultivation, come with me! My Yang Qi is also a little special, and it will benefit your cultivation greatly!"

The audience fell silent after hearing Li Sang’s awkward introduction, and after a moment of silence, it roared with laughter.

Li Sang’s face immediately flushed with redness, but he didn’t dare to run away and waited for his partner.

And right when his two minutes were up, right as he was about to walk out of the red circle, a figure appeared before him, and lt was a pretty young lady.

"If you don’t mind, I will be your partner," she said to him with a charming smile on her face.

This shocked the audience and the other participants. They didn’t expect for Li Sang to actually get a partner after his introduction!

"I-I-I don’t mind!" Li Sang stuttered, as he was just as shocked as everyone else.

"Motherfucker, he actually got a partner!" Ji Ning cried in a low voice.

Su Yang smiled and said, "In the world of dual cultivation, there are people who are desperate and are willing to sacrifice anything in order to achieve their goal, just like the normal cultivation world.*

"You could be the ugliest man in the world, but as long as they are desirable for whatever reason, they can get a woman,"

"Fuck! If Li Sang can get a woman, I don’t believe that I cannot de the same!" Ji Ning’s eyes flared with excitement.

Sometime later, Li Sang returned to the group with his new partner and a wide smile on his face.

"Hahaha! I knew I could do it! Meet Miss Wu, my new partner!"

While Li Sang introduced his new partner to the other two, Su Yang looked at this woman in the eyes.

He could tell that this woman wasn’t actually happy about her new partnership, but for whatever reason, she chose him.

The woman noticed Su Yang staring at her and smiled at him.

He decided to smile back and no longer bothered with her.

Regardless of her reason, it was none of his business, and as long as it wasn’t malicious, he won’t intervene.

Somerime later, Ji Ning went onto the stage and began introducing himself.

Once he was done, he began waiting for his faithful partner.

However, two minutes passed in a flash, and nobody approached him.

Ji Ning released a depressed sigh before regrouping with the others.

"Dont worry, you’ll eventually get one.” Li Sang patted his back when he returned.

"Fuck you.” JT Ning sighed.

Eventually, Wu Bing entered the red circle and began his introduction.

"Wu Bing, 27 years old, I have special Yang Qi, bur I am unable to get my treasure to work. lfbyou can help me get it up, I will give everything I have to offer."

A minute later, three disciples appeared before Wu Bing. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

"Let us try."

"Of course." Wu Bing nodded.

"That fucker got three women?! Damn it!" Ji Ning felt a serong urge to cry. "

"It doesn’t matter how many he gets. lf he cannot get it up, they will all eventually leave him. This isn’t the first time.” Li Sang chuckled.

"Oh, right. Now that you mention it, he had over 20 partners since he joined, but none of them could get his ching up." Ji Ning nodded, feeling a lot less envious.

Eventually, it was time for 696 to enter the stage.

"You’re up next, Disciple Xiao." They turned to look at Su Yang.

"Looks like it." Su Yang smiled, and he slowly approached the red circle.

’Itd that stalker...’ Disciple Fei narrowed her eyes at Su Yang when she saw him from the audience.

Once Su Yang stepped into the circle, he swept the audience whith a sharp gaze before speaking in a loud and clear voice, “I am Xiao Yang, and l used to own a massage parlor in che City of Pleasure before coming to this place. I don’t care if you’re an Outer Court disciple or a Core disciple, if you’re bored of your current partner or you’re feeling stressed, my bedroom door will always be open.”

Su Yang then retrieved a small box and opened it before everyone there, revealing a golden pill within.

"This is a Golden Yin Pill. I won’t explain its properties since I trust that most of if not all of you already know its effects. If you’re not satished whith our cultivation, I will give it to you.

You can find me at building 9 on Outcast Peak."

Su Yang’s introduction was only a minute long, and after he finished, he turned around and walked out of the red circle without giving anybody the chance to approach him, which

left the audience and even Shengguang Qiang dumbfounded.
