Chapter 897 - Mu Yuechan

"Greetings, Immortal Fairy Mu." The guards there quickly bowed to her once they verified her identity.

"Set up the teleport for the Sacred Lands. I have some business there," she said to them.

"Right away. Please give us a couple of minutes."

Mu Yuechan nodded before pulling out a chair and taking a seat on the spot.

"What is Immortal Fairy Mu doing here? I don’t even think she has the authority to enter the Sacred Lands..." One of the guards there whispered to another.

"Who cares? This is Mu Yuechan we’re talking about! If we refuse to help her, she’ll dig out all of our information from our birth to now in a day!" said another.

"Yes, Immortal Fairy Mu is one of the most powerful and dangerous women in the Four Divine Heavens, and it has nothing to do with her cultivation! Her connections and information gathering ability is one of if not the best within the Four Divine Heavens!"

"I remember that time she exposed the Submerged Divine Palace’s million-year corruption and evil deeds to the Four Divine Heavens, causing their demise without moving a single finger! She can literally ruin a person’s entire life if they have committed even a single crime!"

Suddenly, Mu Yuechan’s voice resounded, "I can hear you, Lin Kai, Sheng Shicai, Wan Guchan."

When the guards heard their name come from Mu Yuechan’s mouth despite meeting her for the first time, their eyes widened with shock, and their bodies trembled in fear.

"P-Please spare us, Immortal Fairy Mu!"

They got onto their knees and kowtowed to her.

Mu Yuechan remained nonchalant and said, "I don’t care. Just hurry up and prepare the teleport formation. I have some business to take care of in the Sacred Lands."

"Right away!"

A little over a minute later, the teleport formation was prepared.

"How much?" Mu Yuechan asked the guards afterward.

"Excuse me?"

"Oh? I didn’t know it was free to use the teleport formation. The Sacred Lands is pretty far away, after all," she said.

The guards smiled and said, "It’s not free, but we’re making this an exception for Immortal Fairy Mu."

"Then I won’t be humble." Mu Yuechan said as she approached the teleport formation, disappearing from the platform.

"Phew... That was nerve-wracking..." The guards there released sighs of relief afterward.

"Mu Yuechan... She’s definitely as scary as the rumors say..."

"Can you imagine being the lover of such an individual? I shudder at that thought."

"Are you crazy? Although she’s a peerless beauty, who would dare to become her man? She’ll dig up all of your secrets before you can even blink!"

"I can only imagine someone extremely pure and innocent becoming her lover..."

"Let’s stop talking about her. I’m afraid that she’ll learn about this conversation..." One of the guards suggested.

They all nodded in agreement.

Meanwhile, after entering the teleport formation, Mu Yuechan appeared in the area directly outside the Sacred Lands, where even more guards were posted.

"Who are you?" The guards asked her when she got close.

"Mu Yuechan."

She handed them her medallion.

"Mu Yuechan? That famous information broker? Did you receive authorization to enter the Sacred Lands? You may be a woman, but not all women can enter the place." One of the guards said to her.

"No, I don’t. Can you make this an exception? I have business with the Lonely Fairies’ Refined Palace and their Sect Master Luo Ziyi," she said.

"The Lonely Fairies’ Refined Palace? I’m sorry, but even if you’re Mu Yuechan, I cannot let you enter without permission from the Empress of the Sacred Lands, especially if you’re here for the Lonely Fairies’ Refined Palace."

Mu Yuechan remained calm and said, "Let me speak with your supervisor."

"I’m sorry, Fairy Immortal Mu, but even if you speak with the General..."

Mu Yuechan then interrupted, "You can either get your supervisor here or I can tell your wife about your affair with Lu Jiajing."

The guard immediately stopped talking and stared at Mu Yuechan with a shocked look on his face.

How did she know about his affair?

"A-Are you threatening me?" The guard frowned.

Mu Yuechan remained nonchalant and said, "Yes, I am. What are you going to do about it?"

"..."

"Let her go." Another voice suddenly resounded, causing everybody there to turn their head.

"General Kai!"

The guards greeted him in a respectful voice.

"Let her enter the Sacred Lands." General Kai repeated, and he continued, "I will bear all responsibility if something happens."

"R-Right away!"

The guards no longer dared to block Mu Yuechan and made a path for her. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Mu Yuechan didn’t say anything and entered the Sacred Lands a moment later.

"General... Why?" The guards asked him afterward.

General Kai shook his head and said, "You don’t want to know about it. Just remember this— if you don’t want to lose your life, don’t argue with Mu Yuechan."

"Countless people and powers that are much more powerful than me have fallen because of her."

The guards there swallowed nervously, silently engraving their general’s words in their hearts.

Although they are aware of the information broker called Mu Yuechan, they didn’t know the extent of her influence within the Four Divine Heavens.

"However, the main reason I allowed her to pass isn’t because I’m scared of her. Mu Yuechan, as terrifying as her influence may seem, she’s not a bad individual. I doubt she’s going to the Sacred Lands to cause trouble." General Kai said a moment later.

"Anyways, continue guarding the Sacred Lands. I have a meeting later." General Kai left the scene shortly after.

After entering the Sacred Lands, Mu Yuechan retrieved her flying treasure, and she began making her way towards the Lonely Fairies’ Refined Palace. However, even with her powerful flying treasure, it will still take her around a week to arrive at her destination.
