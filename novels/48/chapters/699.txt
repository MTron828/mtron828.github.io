Chapter 700 - It Just Happened

"As you’d just said, there’s no need to be upset. However, since you did receive the short end of the stick this time, I’ll find a way to make it up to the three of you later," Su Yang said to them with a smile on his face.

"Really? Something as beneficial as the Celestial Pond?" Liu Lanzhi’s hopes immediately became alive again.

"Yes," Su Yang nodded.

"Anyway, now that we have the Four Element Roots, let’s concoct the pill and prepare for the Abandoned Forest," Su Yang said a moment later.

"Okay." They all nodded.

Sometime later, as they returned to the Xie Family’s household, Liu Lanzhi finally noticed the three peerless beauties that were following them, and she asked, "By the way... these three young ladies are..."

"Hm? Oh, right. I forgot to introduce them because of what happened," Su Yang said before he pointed to them and continued, "Starting from the left side, we have Wu Jingjing, Zhu Mengyi, and Lian Li, and they are from the Holy Central Continent. Though, they’ll be following me starting today."

"They followed you all the way from the Holy Central Continent? Why?" Liu Lanzhi did not immediately think of them as Su Yang’s lovers, as the possibility of Su Yang having children was near zero in her mind.

"Why, you ask? Why else would I have beauties following me?" Su Yang laughed in a low voice.

Hearing his words, Liu Lanzhi’s eyes immediately widened from shock.

"What?! You seduced two women with children of their own already? That’s quite ridiculous even for someone like you, Su Yang!" Liu Lanzhi exclaimed in a shocked voice.

"Uhh... I think you are misunderstanding something..." Wu Jingjing suddenly said to Liu Lanzhi.

"Misunderstanding? What am I misunderstanding?" Liu Lanzhi tilted her head in a puzzled manner.

"These children... they’re Su Yang’s children..." Wu Jingjing said, revealing the truth to her.

"WHAT?!" Liu Lanzhi immediately tripped on her own feet after hearing Wu Jingjing’s words, facepalming the ground with her beautiful face.

"Are you okay...?" They looked at her with dumbfounded looks.

However, Liu Lanzhi did not respond. Hell, she didn’t even try to get off the ground and remained laying on the ground with her face kissing the dirt until a few moments later.

"T-T-T-They are... y-your... children...? Su Yang? Really?" Liu Lanzhi looked at him with an expression he’d never seen her make before.

"That’s right. They’re both my daughter," Su Yang nodded with a prideful expression on his face. "That’s Wu Min, and that’s Zhu Jiayi."

"Heavens... I never thought I’d see this day..." Liu Lanzhi mumbled in a dazed voice.

"..."

Even the disciples were staring at Su Yang with baffled looks on their faces, as it was also quite shocking for them.

"T-The other disciples don’t know about this yet, right? I cannot imagine how they will react once they learn about this..." Liu Lanzhi said as her body trembled slightly.

Sometime later, once Liu Lanzhi calmed down enough, they continued walking back to Snowfall City.

"I still cannot believe it, Su Yang. What made you want to have children? You don’t look like the type to willingly have children..." Liu Lanzhi asked him afterward.

"It just happened," Su Yang shrugged.

"I was the one who asked him to i.m.p.r.e.g.n.a.t.e me," Wu Jingjing suddenly said. "Although I did say that I won’t make him bear responsibility at first, it still happened in the end."

"Me too!" Zhu Mengyi said.

"Unbelievable..." Liu Lanzhi was speechless.

Sometime later, once they returned to the Xie Family’s household, Su Yang said to Xie Wang, "Bring out all of the ingredients required for the poison pill."

"Right away." Xie Wang nodded before leaving the scene.

A few minutes later, Xie Wang returned with the ingredients.

"Here you go."

"Do you have any decent pill cauldrons in this house? My ordinary cauldron might not be able to handle the strength of the pill."

"We do have a pill room," Lord Xie nodded.

"Follow me."

Su Yang and everybody there followed Lord Xie to the pill room a few minutes later.

"This is usually used by my Xie Family’s Alchemists," Lord Xie said. "Use it as you please."

Once he was inside the room, Su Yang laid out all of the ingredients on the floor before sitting in front of the cauldron.

"Mengyi, I will need your assistance for this one," Su Yang suddenly said.

"Huh? You need my help?" Zhu Mengyi raised her eyebrows.

"Yes, your Azure Flames to be precise. My ordinary flames won’t be powerful enough to melt the Four Elements Root," he said.

"But I have never used the Four Element Roots before," she shook her head. "I might screw up the entire thing."

"It’s fine. I just need you to keep your Azure Flames active and at the highest temperature for a few minutes. I’ll control it for you," Su Yang said.

"You’ll control my Azure Flames? Is that even possible?" Zhu Mengyi’s eyes widened at his words, as this is her first time hearing of such a thing. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

"Yes, I’ll also use my own alchemy flames to control and adjust your Azure Flames whilst adding to the temperature myself until it reaches the perfect temperature. You just need to keep your own temperature steady so I don’t have to adjust too much."

"Okay." Zhu Mengyi nodded. She then handed Zhu Jiayi to Wu Jingjing before sitting on the other side of the cauldron.

"Ready when you are," she said.

"Go ahead."

Hearing his words, Zhu Mengyi activated her Azure Flames around the pill cauldron.

"Keep it at your max temperature, I’ll do the rest," Su Yang said to her as he brought out his own ordinary alchemy flames that did not lose to her Azure Flames’ fierceness in the slightest.

Once the pill cauldron reached the perfect temperature, Su Yang used his spiritual energy to toss in the ingredients one at a time.

A few minutes later, only the Four Elements Root remained untouched. After taking a deep breath, Su Yang also tossed the Four Elements Root into the cauldron.
