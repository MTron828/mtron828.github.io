Chapter 961 Mei Xing“s Mother

"Hello, my name is Xiao Yang, and I am the Manager of Heavenly Massage. Although I am here to visit you under Mei Xing’s request, I am personally interested in what kind of woman gave birth to such an intelligent little girl." Su Yang greeted her with a charming smile on his face.

"I didn’t think you’d visit me so soon... I apologize if I’ve caused any inconvenience..." Mei Xing’s mother said.

And she continued, "My name is Mei Ying."

"Then Madam Mei, I heard you wanted to speak with me? Oh, you don’t have to worry about your next customer because I will be your customer for the rest of the day."

"Y-You mean you..." Mei Ying looked at him with wide eyes.

After a moment of silence, she continued, "Please, take a seat."

She pointed at the bed with her hands.

Su Yang nodded and took a seat on the large bed.

"Allow me to apologize in advance if I’d offended you for doubting you, but I was just worried about Mei Xing working for a place I have never heard of before. Can you tell me a little more about yourself? Why did you decide to work at the City of Pleasure? And what are your goals?"

"I don’t mind. I completely understand your situation as a mother. As you already know, my name is Xiao Yang, and I came to the City of Pleasure to do what I enjoy doing after failing my scholar exams— giving massages. As for my goal... I honestly don’t have one for now. I know that sounds weird, but I just want to experience working by myself until I have an idea what I want to do next."

"Eh? Does that mean you won’t stay in the City of Pleasure forever?" Mei Xing was the first to speak after hearing his words.

Su Yang shook his head, "I do not intend on staying here forever. I will probably be here only for a couple of months— maybe a year at most."

"Is that so..."

Mei Xing lowered her head in a dejected manner after learning that he will only be in the City of Pleasure for a few months.

"Do you have any plans for after you leave the City of Pleasure?" Mei Ying suddenly asked him.

"Not yet, but I hope to travel the Four Divine Heavens and improve my cultivation some more," he said.

"Oh, right. Mei Xing mentioned to me that you are a cultivator and that you’d lend her a cultivation technique, not to mention her salary. Thank you very much for your generosity..."

"But are you sure you want to give her so much money? 100 gold coins is a lot for a month’s worth of work as a receptionist..."

Su Yang smiled and said, "My business is doing much better than I’d expected, so I can afford to give a little more than others, and listening to Mei Xing’s story made me want to help your situation out even if it’s a little. It must be difficult being a single mother while working in this place. If you need help, just let me know."

"Thank you, but just your thoughts are enough, and you’ve already helped us plenty by allowing Mei Xing to work for you. If she ever causes any trouble for you, please let me know and I will scold her properly."

"Mother! I won’t cause any trouble for the Manager!" Mei Xing pouted after hearing that.

Su Yang chuckled, "I don’t think I have to worry about that. Despite her age, she’s very mature. In fact, sometimes I forget that she’s only 12 years old."

"Yes, I understand very well how you feel." Mei Ying also laughed a little in a graceful manner.

Mei Xing’s eyes flickered when she saw her mother laugh genuinely, something that very rarely happens.

After chatting with each other for almost an hour, Su Yang suddenly said, "Do you want a massage? I have noticed some stiffness within your movements. Maybe I can loosen up your body a little." Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

"A-Are you sure...? I don’t want to trouble you any more than I already am..."

"It’s no trouble at all, and as a masseur, I cannot ignore someone like you," Su Yang said with a charming smile on his face.

"I-If you insist... Please take care of me..."

A moment later, Mei Ying laid on the bed, her body still completely naked.

"..."

Su Yang narrowed his eyes when Mei Ying removed the blankets covering the bruises and scars on her body.

When Mei Ying noticed that Su Yang was staring at her injuries, she said with a bittersweet smile, "Please don’t mind them. I have had a couple of rough customers throughout the years..."

Su Yang closed his eyes and took a deep breath.

He then placed his hands on her smooth body and began massaging her back.

Mei Xing watched Su Yang massage her mother from the sideline, realizing that this was her first time witnessing Su Yang’s massage with her own eyes.

"Ah—"

Mei Ying released a soft moan when Su Yang began massaging her body, but she quickly covered her mouth with her hands, as she didn’t want to make such noises when her daughter was literally in the same room.

However, it was incredibly hard to not moan when experiencing Su Yang’s godlike hand techniques.

"It’s okay, mother. Just let it out." Mei Xing suddenly said to her in a calm voice.

Mei Ying looked at her with wide eyes.

And she continued, "In fact, I can wait outside."

Mei Xing then started walking towards the door.

"It’s okay, you can stay here." Su Yang said to her, and then he snapped his fingers, creating a formation around the bed.

"You can also let your voice out now. Mei Xing won’t hear a thing as long as this formation is here." Su Yang then said to Mei Ying.

Hearing his words, Mei Ying immediately removed her hands from her mouth and started moaning in pleasure.

"..."

Mei Xing proceeded to watch as her mother display blissful expressions in silence. Even though she couldn’t hear anything, it was clear that her mother was enjoying the massage very much.
