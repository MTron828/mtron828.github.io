Chapter 493 The End of the Mu Family

Even after Mu Lan left the place, the restaurant remained dead silent, almost as though they were afraid of being noticed by Sun Jingjing.

A few moments later, Sun Jingjing’s parents approached them.

"T-This was your plan?" Sun Ren asked her with a baffled expression, as she did not expect such an elaborate plan.

"Well... not exactly..." Sun Jingjing showed a slight smile, and she continued, "We had planned to make Mu Shun so jealous to the point where he attacks Su Yang, giving us a reason to deal with the Mu Family once and for all. It all worked according to plan until... Alas, neither of us could have expected that he’d die in such a manner. I kind of regret not killing him the moment he attacked us. At least that would’ve been more satisfying."

"What would you have done if he hadn’t fallen for your provocations?"

"I would’ve still dealt with them whether Mu Shun attacked us or not. I just wanted Mu Shun to feel despair for all the things that he’s done."

"You... unbelievable!" Sun Ren was speechless. Never in a million years would she have expected her own daughter to become daring enough to face off the entire Mu Family by herself.

Of course, if Su Yang wasn’t there, Sun Jingjing might not have appeared as dominant and overbearing today.

"Anyway, let’s get out of here. Who knows what the Mu Family might do later..." Sun Quan said.

However, Su Yang shook his head and said, "Don’t worry, the Mu Family won’t do anything. To be more precise, they won’t be able to do anything after today."

"What do you mean by that?" They all looked at him with a puzzled face.

"You will understand in a few days," he replied with a mysterious smile.

Once the Su Yang and the Sun Family returned to their home, news regarding what happened at the Jade Rabbit Restaurant between the Sun Family and the Mu Family spread throughout the city like wildfire.

By the end of the day, not a single person within the city hasn’t heard of Mu Shun’s embarrassing death.

"What? So the engagement between the Mu Family and Sun Family was only a one-sided agreement because the Mu Family had pressured the Sun Family into accepting it? How despicable! But it’s not entirely shocking, since it’s the Mu Family we are talking about, after all!"

"Hahaha! That fat bastard got rejected so hard by Fairy Sun to the point where he died from heartbreak?! That is hilarious! I wish I had been there to witness his final moments!"

"That number one genius, Su Yang, is currently here in the city? And he even declared Sun Jingjing as his woman?! The Sun Family will be laughing until they take their last breath!"

In just a single day after the Mu Family had been exposed, all of their business saw record low sales, with their smallest loss being a 90% decline in sales.

Even their most popular store, the Nature Medicine Hall, was unable to welcome more than 100 customers that day even with the Burning Lotus Pills still on sale when they would usually see thousands of customers.

On the second day, after the Burning Lotus Sect received news of what happened to the Mu Family, they immediately revoked their business partnership with the Mu Family, essentially putting the nails in Mu Family’s coffins.

By the third day, the businesses owned by the Mu Family could not even make 10 sales even when combining all of the store sales together.

It was as clear as day that the Mu Family’s dominance within the business circle was coming to an end. It is now only a matter of time before they get kicked out of the city.

Meanwhile, the businesses owned by the Sun Family skyrocketed in popularity and sales, seeing over 1,000% in profit within just three short days. Furthermore, the Burning Lotus Sect decided to become business partners with them, boosting their sales even further.

As for the Sun Family themselves, they were bombarded with visitors who congratulated their daughter for being successful in life as a Cultivator and a woman. Of course, many of these visitors also happened to bring along their own daughters. It was obvious what they were planning, but alas, most of them didn’t even get to meet with Su Yang, as he was busy cultivating with Sun Jingjing most of the time.

As for those that managed to take a peek at Su Yang’s face, they were so overwhelmed by his presence that their minds went blank along with their plans to try and court him.

By the end of their second week there, Su Yang and Sun Jingjing prepared to return to the Profound Blossom Sect.

"Are you sure that you don’t want to stay here any longer?" Sun Ren asked them, clearly reluctant to see them go.

"Unfortunately, I no longer have the time to stay here anymore. The Profound Blossom Sect will start its disciple recruitment next week, and I have to be there to oversee the entire thing as the Sect Master," said Su Yang.

"I will also return to the Sect with him just in case they need me." Sun Jingjing also decided to return to the sect.

"I see... I have gotten used to your presence here over the last two weeks, and it’ll definitely get a little bit lonely with you two gone." Sun Ren sighed.

"Don’t forget to visit us once in a while." Sun Quan said to them with a smile.

After saying their goodbyes to her family, Sun Jingjing and Su Yang returned to the Profound Blossom Sect.

"These past two weeks have given me the most memorable moments of my life so far..." Sun Jingjing said to him with a warm smile. "I wonder if that’s what our life would look like if we were not Cultivators."

"I know I say this often, but thank you, Su Yang, for accepting someone like me into your life..." Sun Jingjing mumbled in his embrace.

"And thank you, for choosing to be in my life..." Su Yang said with a gentle smile as he returned her embrace with a passionate kiss on the lips.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m
