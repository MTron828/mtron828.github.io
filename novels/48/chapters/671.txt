Chapter 672 - Heavenly Gratification

"What are you waiting for? Let’s hurry up and eat so we can end this farce..." Lian Li said to Su Yang after seeing that he hasn’t moved after many moments, seemingly a little nervous and impatient.

"What’s the rush? The food won’t go anywhere, and I’d like to have your company for as long as possible. After all, you don’t get to have dinner with someone of your stature often." Su Yang said with a calm expression on his face.

"..."

The nervousness in Lian Li’s eyes became more apparent after she heard Su Yang’s words.

’Did he notice our plan?! No! That’s not possible!’ Lian Li cried inwardly.

"Hmph! If you won’t eat, then I’ll eat and immediately leave afterward!" Lian Li said in an irritated voice before she began eating the food.

Su Yang shook his head and decided to eat a moment later.

However, the second his tongue touched the food, his eyebrows slightly trembled, and he immediately realized what was going on.

’This little girl really thinks she can poison me? Very well! I shall teach you a valuable lesson!’ Su Yang sneered inwardly before chewing and swallowing the food without hesitation.

’He ate it! He really ate the food! Hahahaha! I have won, you damn pervert! I cannot wait to see you humiliate yourself!’ Lian Li laughed inwardly after seeing his actions, barely able to resist laughing out loud for real.

’This subtle but bitter taste... I see what’s going on. So that’s what you were planning, huh? Unfortunately for you, you have picked the wrong person to poison!’ Su Yang shook his head inwardly after swallowing the food.

"..."

"..."

"..."

After a few minutes of pure silence, when Lian Li could no longer hold her laughter, she burst out laughing, "Hahahaha! Seeing you eating so peacefully and ignorantly, I cannot help but laugh!"

"Huh? What’s so funny about that?" Su Yang acted ignorantly and asked her with a puzzled expression on his handsome face.

However, Lian Li merely laughed even louder in response to his question.

A few seconds later, Su Yang pretended as though he’d finally come to a realization and exclaimed in a shocked voice, "D-Don’t tell me you did something to the food?! Did you poison me?!"

"Hahaha! That’s right! I did put something in your food!" Lian Li instantly admitted to her crimes.

"What did you put in my food?!" Su Yang stood up angrily.

"Have you ever heard of a flower called Heavenly Gratification?" FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

"Heavenly Gratification? What is that?" Su Yang frowned.

"It’s a rare flower that produces these odorless powders that when consumed, it will make that person feel extreme pleasure, and they will be forced to ejaculate nonstop for many hours! It’s the perfect medicine for a pervert like you!"

"What?! How dare you poison me with such a heinous poison!"

"Don’t worry, the poison won’t kill you. In fact, you’ll probably even thank me in the end! Hahaha!" Lian Li laughed merrily.

"..."

"..."

"..."

After a moment of silence from Su Yang, to Lian Li’s surprise, he suddenly sat down and continued eating the food as though nothing had happened.

"Eh?" Lian Li stared at him with wide eyes.

"W-Why are you still eating the food? Didn’t you hear me? I said it’s poisoned!" she asked him.

Su Yang then plucked a small piece from the food and rolled it until it resembled a pill, and he showed it to her while speaking in a calm voice, "Did you really think I didn’t know about the poison? Although it has no odor, it has a distinct taste that I immediately recognized the second it touched my tongue."

Lian Li’s eyes widened with shock upon hearing his words.

"T-Then why did you continue to eat it?! And why are you still eating it now?!" she asked him in a baffled voice.

"Why? Because the poison won’t affect me," Su Yang casually replied.

"It won’t affect you...? How is that possible?!"

"Because the poison will only work on those who are inexperienced with controlling their own body when it comes to their bodily fluids and whatnot."

"W-What does that even mean? You’re not making any sense!" Lian Li said with a frown.

"In other words, I am a Dual Cultivator, and I have perfect control over my own body, so the poison won’t affect me. Though, that is not to say the poison has no effect at all. I am simply controlling it."

"..."

Lian Li stared at him with wide eyes, seemingly in disbelief.

Dual Cultivator? He was a Dual Cultivator all along? How is that possible when he is clearly a swordmaster?

"I know what you’re thinking, but I gave up the path of swords long ago to pursue my path of dual cultivation," he said to her in a calm voice.

"Impossible! How old are you even? How can you reach such a level with the sword and then have the time to become a Dual Cultivator?!" Lian Li asked him.

"This body is only eighteen years old, but I have lived far longer than 18 years," Su Yang responded.

"Huh? You are only 18 years old?" Lian Li was already shocked by the first part, much less the latter part.

"B-But what do you mean by ’living longer than 18 years’ when you are only 18 years old? That doesn’t make any sense!" Lian Li said after a moment of silence.

"I won’t spoil the fun so I’ll let you try to figure it out yourself." Su Yang shook his head.

"By the way, don’t expect me to not punish you for trying to poison me even though it doesn’t have any effect on me." Su Yang suddenly said.

"W-What are you going to do to me? In case you forgot, my father is—"

"I am going to do this..."

In the midst of her sentence, Su Yang flicked his fingers, shooting the food that he’d shaped into a pill a minute ago directly into Lian Li’s mouth.

*Gasp*

It had happened so suddenly that Lian Li accidentally swallowed the food, and she silently stared at him with wide eyes filled with disbelief.
