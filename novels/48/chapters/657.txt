Chapter 658 - This F.u.c.ker Is Really Handsome!

’F.u.c.k! I have never been this f.u.c.k.i.n.g angry before! I wasn’t this angry even when I found out that Wu Jingjing had been i.m.p.r.e.g.n.a.t.ed by another man! It’s only when this motherf.u.c.ker finally shows himself that my suppressed emotions are exploding!’ Lian Heng cursed inwardly.

’Where has he been for the past year? Why did he have to show up now— when I finally decided to toss my pride as the Crown Prince aside and started courting Wu Jingjing again despite her status as a sullied woman?!’

When a woman is no longer pure and loses her status as a maiden, especially if that woman is not married, they are often referred to as a sullied woman or other similar terms. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

After following the disciple for many minutes, the disciple suddenly shouted, "Over there, Your Highness! That’s Wu Jingjing and her partner!"

"Let me see this bastard’s face!"

Lian Heng pushed the disciple to the side and stared at Wu Jingjing and the handsome young man standing beside her in the distance.

’F.u.c.k! This f.u.c.ker is really handsome!’ Lian Heng’s eyes widened with surprise, as he didn’t expect Wu Jingjing’s partner to be such a handsome individual, and that somehow lessened his anger, because if Wu Jingjing had picked someone that was uglier than him, it would’ve definitely worsened his rage.

After waking up from his daze a moment later, Lian Heng shouted loudly before approaching them, "Stop right there!"

"Hm?"

Su Yang lifted his eyebrows when he noticed Lian Heng walking towards their direction in an aggressive manner and a face twisted in anger.

"That’s Lian Heng... Emperor Lian’s son..." Wu Jingjing said to him in a low voice.

Once they were only a few meters apart, Lian Heng stopped walking and stared at Su Yang directly in his eyes.

"Wu Jingjing greets His Highness," Wu Jingjing bowed to him in a courteous manner.

Lian Heng would normally respond to her greetings, but he was too emotional right now to even glance at her.

"Who the hell are you?" Lian Heng spoke to Su Yang in a cold and demanding voice.

"..."

Su Yang looked at Lian Heng with a calm expression on his face before speaking in a nonchalant voice, "It is common courtesy to introduce yourself before you ask for another’s identity."

"Such insolence! Who do you think you are standing before?!" Lian Heng roared.

"I don’t care who you are, but can you lower your voice? If you scare my daughter and make her cry, I might not be able to control my emotions," Su Yang spoke with a frown on his face.

*Gasp!*

The disciple watching this scene in the background immediately gasped after hearing Su Yang’s words.

"H-He confirmed it himself! He’s really Wu Min’s father!"

Even though the disciples didn’t need Su Yang to say that he was the father, it was still shocking to hear his confirmation.

"..."

Lian Heng’s body trembled violently, and his cultivation at the peak of the Heavenly Spirit Realm erupted a second later, causing the atmosphere there to change.

"CRAZY BASTARD!" Lian Feng roared.

"Waaaaa! Waaaa! Waaaaah!"

Wu Min began crying loudly after being startled by Lian Heng’s loud voice.

"You little bastard..." Su Yang growled under his breath, and his eyes began turning red.

"Calm her down for me while I take care of this insolent bastard who doesn’t know the immensity between heaven and earth!" Su Yang passed the crying Wu Jingjing with a scary expression on his face.

When Wu Jingjing saw the spine-chilling expression on his face and felt the killing intent in his aura, she hastily spoke in a terrified voice, "Y-You can’t kill him! He’s Emperor’s Lian son!"

However, no response came from Su Yang as he immediately rushed at Lian Heng after handing Wu Min to Wu Jingjing.

"Hahaha! What do you think you are going to do with your cultivation that’s only at the sixth level Heavenly Spirit Realm?! I am at the peak of the—"

Lian Heng laughed arrogantly when he saw Su Yang rushing at him despite his superior cultivation base. However, before Lian Heng could even finish his sentence, Su Yang suddenly disappeared from his view and appeared right beside him in a split second, and the only thing he saw before feeling intense pain was a large fist flying towards his handsome face.

Boom!

Despite having a higher cultivation base and being at the peak of the Heavenly Spirit Realm, Lian Heng was unable to resist the immense force from Su Yang’s punch and was sent flying like a ragdoll before smashing into one of the buildings there and destroying the wall.

"..."

The entire place turned silent, and the disciples there stared at Su Yang and the massive hole in the wall with gawking expressions on their faces, looking as though they’d just witnessed their ancestors rising from their graves.

Hell, even Wu Min stopped crying when she witnessed the scene.

"Oh, my lord... He actually dared to punch Emperor Lian’s son in the face!"

The disciples exclaimed with terrified expressions after they realized the gravity of the situation.

"HOW DARE YOU!"

Lian Heng escaped from the rubble a few seconds later and landed many meters away from Su Yang before staring at him with bloodshot eyes and a bloody nose.

"I SWEAR TO—"

Lian Heng roared.

However, before he could even finish his sentence, Su Yang suddenly appeared before him in an instant like a ghost and grabbed his robes by the chest.

"Are you trying to scare my daughter with your loud voice again? I guess you are the slow type that needs more than one lesson before you understand anything."

Su Yang raised his fist and punched Lian Heng in the face again.

However, because Su Yang was clutching to his robes, Lian Heng did not fly anywhere and remained standing— levitating there.

"Do you understand now?" Su Yang suddenly punched Lian Heng in the face again before he could even open his mouth to respond.

"No?"

*Pop*

Su Yang punched him again.

"How about now?"

*Pop*

"Still no?"

*Pop* *Pop* *Pop*

"..."

The disciples watched in horror as Su Yang savagely pummeled Lian Heng in his face for the next few minutes until Lian Heng’s entire face was swollen black and blue.
