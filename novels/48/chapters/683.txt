Chapter 684 Is There Anything He Cannot Do?

After leaving Zhu Mengyi’s living quarters, Sect Master Zhu brought Su Yang and the others to a mountain somewhere behind the Four Seasons Academy.

Once they reached the peak of this mountain, Su Yang could see a dozen elderlies wearing the Four Seasons Academy uniform, and they were standing around this luxurious pill cauldron.

"These are all the top Alchemists and sect elders I trust in the sect, and they’ll be watching the process if you don’t mind." Sect Master Zhu said to Su Yang after they arrived.

"I wouldn’t mind even if you brought every disciple here," Su Yang said.

She nodded, and then she proceeded to introduce Su Yang to the sect elders: "This is Su Yang, and although he may have a very young appearance, don’t let his appearance fool you, as his Alchemy skills are beyond what everyone here is capable of. Even if we all combined our talents and skills, we still won’t be able to match him. Furthermore, he is also the one who gave us the full recipe for the Soul Divination Pill."

"Thank you for allowing us to witness history being made, Senior Su."

"Words cannot express my gratitude, Senior Su."

"Even though I have never seen it myself, I have heard great things about your alchemy skills, and I feel honored to be here today, Senior Su."

The sect elders all greeted him with sincere respect, as Sect Master Zhu had warned them about Su Yang’s unfathomable background that surpasses even the Lian Family without telling them everything about him.

After greeting Su Yang, the sect elders bowed to Lian Li. Although her presence was definitely unexpected, they didn’t think too much about it.

’Su Yang... he was the one who gave them the full recipe? Just who are you, really?’ Lian Li wondered to herself.

"Here are all of the ingredients. We triple checked it so there shouldn’t be any missing." Sect Master Zhu said to him as she pointed at the neatly organized ingredients piled beside each other by the pill cauldron.

Su Yang did not even look at the ingredients and merely took a deep breath before nodding his head, "Yes, all of the ingredients are here."

"..."

The alchemists were astonished by Su Yang’s godlike sense of smell. Not even a dog would be able to do what he just did! Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

A few moments later, Su Yang stood in front of the pill cauldron.

After taking a deep breath, he waved his sleeves, causing the ingredients to all float in the air. However, he didn’t immediately toss all of the ingredients into the pill cauldron as he normally would.

"Since this is a demonstration and I am trying to teach you how to concoct this pill, I will do this one step at a time and in a method that can be replicated— including the speed at which I concoct the pill at. However, I am only going to do this once, since this will take many hours, so if you miss it..." Su Yang said to them.

The sect elders nodded with a serious expression on their faces, feeling like they are back in their prime days when they were still trying to learn the basics of alchemy.

"For the first ingredient, I am going to put..."

Su Yang started the process a few moments later, and he began throwing one ingredient at a time into the pill cauldron whilst explaining to the sect elders what they should be doing for the best results.

And because none of these alchemists could possibly replicate Su Yang’s ridiculous alchemy skills, nor do they have his alchemy flames control, Su Yang must lower his abilities and the speed he concocted the pill to their standards, which meant he was spending many minutes on a single ingredient when he would usually spend a few seconds after tossing in all of the ingredients at once.

One hour... two hours... three hours...

Many hours have passed since Su Yang began his lecture with the sky turning dark long ago.

"This is the last ingredient and also the most important step so watch carefully." Su Yang said as he began the final step.

And even though the sect elders have been standing there like statues for multiple hours without any breaks and barely blinking their eyes, none of them appeared to be tired. In fact, their gazes all emitted a profound aura that was filled with energy and excitement.

After another hour, Su Yang retrieved his alchemy flames before taking the Soul Divination Pill out of the pill cauldron and showing it to the sect elders.

"Ooooh! It’s real! This is really the Soul Divination Pill!"

"I cannot believe my eyes! I didn’t think I would live long enough to see the existence of a second Soul Divination Pill!"

"Hahahaha! I have witnessed history today! I have witnessed history!!!"

All of the sect elders began acting like a bunch of children when they confirmed that it was possible to concoct the Soul Divination Pill.

"C-Can I hold it...?" Sect Master Zhu suddenly asked him in a shaky voice.

"Yes, and since I have no use for it, you can keep it." Su Yang said as he handed the pill to her.

"Heavens... I have never seen such a beautiful— perfect pill in my life before..."

Tears flowed from Sect Master Zhu’s eyes as she held the flawless-quality Soul Divination Pill with trembling hands, and she’d even dropped to her knees a moment later.

The Four Seasons Academy has studied the Soul Divination Pill for many generations since the sect’s foundation, so it meant an immense deal to her and the sect elders who managed to witness and experience their ancestors’ dreams.

’Unbelievable... He really concocted the Soul Divination Pill just like that...’ Lian Li stared at Su Yang with a dazed look on her face. Just how can one be talented and experienced in so many fields at once?

’Swords... Dual Cultivation... and now Alchemy? Is there anything that he cannot do?’ Lian Li wondered to herself as the sect elders continued to celebrate this wondrous occasion.
