Chapter 838 - Sovereign Spirit Realm

BOOM!

Su Yang’s body suddenly exploded with flames the moment he swallowed the Fiery Hellfire Seed, causing the formation to shake violently.

"Su Yang?!"

"Su Yang!"

"Are you okay, Su Yang?!"

All of the girls exclaimed simultaneously in a shocked voice when they saw Su Yang explode like a bomb.

"Calm down, he’s fine," Qiuyue said to them after her initial surprise. "I can still sense his aura."

The ladies took a deep breath after hearing Qiuyue’s words, but the formation remained engulfed in flames for many minutes, keeping their anxiety at the top.

Half an hour later, the fire finally began subduing and the others could see Su Yang’s figure again.

However, when they saw Su Yang again, he was completely n.a.k.e.d from head to toe, and even his luscious long hair and eyebrows were completely burned away by the flames.

"This is..." Su Liqing found this scene very nostalgic since the same thing happened when Su Yang consumed the Pure Yang Flower two years ago.

A few minutes after Su Yang reappeared, his hair began growing back, returning to its original length, but it looked more silky and healthy than previously.

However, a few seconds later, to the ladies’ surprise, his hair was engulfed in flames and burned until there was nothing left.

This scene repeated itself many times over the next few hours, and the ladies watched as Su Yang’s hair experienced rebirths over 100 times.

A couple more hours later, Su Yang’s body suddenly began turning red with veins popping from all over his body. Furthermore, these veins were glowing crimson, almost like there was lava flowing within them.

"Heavens, I cannot imagine what he must be experiencing right now... It looks very painful." Sun Jingjing mumbled in a dazed voice.

A few minutes later, the veins on Su Yang’s body suddenly began bursting, startling the ladies.

However, when everyone there expected blood, flames spewed out from them instead! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

"Su Yang! Are you okay?!" Xie Xingfang couldn’t help but ask him.

"I am fine." Su Yang responded in a mosquito-like voice.

At this moment, Su Yang looked like a broken pipe with holes all over his body and flames spraying out of these holes; it was a horrifying sight to say the least for these ladies.

However, Su Yang’s injuries began healing over time, and after another hour, his appearance returned to normal minus the hair as they were still missing.

A few more minutes later, Su Yang’s hair began regrowing again, but they looked a little different than usual.

"R-Red hair?" The ladies’ eyes widened when Su Yang suddenly grew red hair.

His red hair glistened as if there were stars living in it, and the hair itself gave a fiery appearance, almost like it was burning inside.

However, Su Yang’s red hair did not last long as it was burned away a few moments later. Once his hair returned, it was back to its original black color, but its glistening appearance remained.

This time, his hair stayed permanently and would no longer disappear.

After the drastic changes that lasted for many hours, Su Yang finally calmed down and no longer spewed fire from his body, and he proceeded to cultivate peacefully as though everything was normal.

However, the ladies didn’t dare to let their guard down and remained vigilant just in case Su Yang’s body did something crazy again.

One hour... two hours... three hours...

Almost 24 hours have passed since Su Yang consumed the Fiery Hellfire Seed.

"It’s happening." Qiuyue suddenly said, snapping the ladies out of their daze.

Crack... Crack... Crack...

The formation Qiuyue created around Su Yang began cracking, and when Qiuyue saw this, she immediately created a few more formations around him.

Bang!

The first formation shattered into countless pieces a minute after Qiuyue created the other formations. However, these formations were also beginning to crack.

Seeing this, Qiuyue activated her Divine Lord Realm cultivation base and created a small but sturdy formation around Su Yang.

BOOM!

While the formation didn’t crack this time, it could not block all of the impacts, which caused the entire yang Pagoda to shake violently, shocking the disciples waiting inside the building and the female cultivators waiting outside.

"Qiuyue, you can remove the formation." Su Yang suddenly said to her a moment later once the place calmed down.

Qiuyue nodded.

Once the formation was removed, Su Yang slowly stood up with a tyrannical aura that only belonged to Sovereign Spirit Realm cultivators around him.

He then turned to look at the ladies on the bed with a smile on his face.

"I’m going to do this in the order I met you ladies, so Liqing will be first." Su Yang said.

Su Liqing swallowed nervously after hearing his words, and she pointed at the raging boner between his legs and spoke, "Su Yang... Are you sure you’re okay?"

Su Yang looked down at his own rod, which had a fiery appearance and was also glowing red, almost like his body in the beginning.

"Don’t worry, it’s perfectly safe. While it might feel a little hotter than usual, it won’t do any damage to your body." Su Yang chuckled.

Su Liqing trusted Su Yang and nodded her head.

A few moments later, Su Liqing removed her clothes while the other ladies got off the bed to make space for them.

"The rest of you should also take off your clothes since this won’t take long." Su Yang said to the others as he got on the bed and approached Su Liqing, who already had her legs spread wide open.

Su Yang didn’t bother to do any foreplay and directly poked Su Liqing’s entrance with his rod without entering her cave.

"Ah! So hot!" Su Liqing was initially startled by the heat coming from Su Yang’s stiff rod, but she quickly realized that it wasn’t painful in the slightest.

And to Su Liqing’s surprise, almost like it reacted to the heat, her little sister immediately began drooling with Yin Qi.

"Are you ready, Liqing?" Su Yang asked her.

"I am." Su Liqing nodded with a loving expression on her face, feeling very nostalgic in this situation.
