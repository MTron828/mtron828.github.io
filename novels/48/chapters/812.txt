Chapter 813 - An Excuse to Embrace You

Su Yang gazed at Lu Youyi who was looking back at him with a l.u.s.tful gaze.

"If you’re doing this just to thank me, you don’t have to push yourself. I don’t need you to thank me in such a manner," said Su Yang.

"T-That’s not it!" Lu Youyi quickly responded once she realized that she’d gone around this the wrong way, and she continued, "It’s just that... I wanted an excuse to embrace you... I’m sorry..."

Then she continued, "You’re not only my savior but I also enjoyed every moment I had with you for the past few days, and I’d heard about your background from my parents. Once you leave this place, you’ll return to the Eastern Continent, right? I just wanted a memorable moment with you before you leave this place..."

"..."

The room turned silent, and after a good minute of silence, Su Yang said, "I’ll return in a few hours to let your body rest."

"D-Does that mean..." Lu Youyi looked at him with surprise on her face.

Su Yang nodded with a smile on his face, "It’ll be a memorable moment that you will never be able to forget."

"Okay! I’ll be waiting!" Lu Youyi nodded with anticipation clearly written on her face.

After returning to his own room, Lian Li asked him, "That should be that young lady’s last treatment, right? Are we leaving now?"

Su Yang shook his head and explained to her the situation, "No, we’ll stay here for a bit longer. After all, she wants to..." ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Lian Li couldn’t help but smile after hearing his words, and she said a moment later, "Why am I not surprised that you’d seduced the young lady?"

Su Yang shrugged.

"Anyway, you’re going to accept her offer, right? I highly doubt someone like you would refuse a pretty young lady like her, especially if she genuinely likes you."

Su Yang nodded and said, "Yes, I’ll fulfill her desires."

A few hours later, Su Yang went to find Lu Youyi’s parents and said to them, "I am going to do a check-up on your daughter one last time before I leave just in case there is any poison left in her body. It might take a little longer since this one will be more thorough."

"I understand. Thank you very much for your hard work, esteemed guest." Lu Duhan thanked him, completely unaware that Su Yang was about to literally check every inch of his daughter’s body.

After speaking to Lu Duhan, Su Yang went straight to Lu Youyi’s room.

Inside, Lu Youyi was already prepared and expecting him.

"Welcome, Su Yang..." Lu Youyi immediately blushed after seeing his face.

Su Yang closed the door before locking it with a minor formation just in case someone decides to open the door.

"Are you ready?" Su Yang asked Lu Youyi who was sitting on her bed with the blankets covering her body.

"I am..." she nodded, letting go of the blankets in her hands.

The blankets fell onto the bed, revealing to Su Yang her round peaks and smooth skin.

Su Yang approached her with calm steps, and a moment later, he placed his hands on her b.r.e.a.s.ts, gently groping them.

"Mmm..." Lu Youyi m.o.a.ned in a soft voice as Su Yang’s hands squeezed her b.r.e.a.s.ts, feeling a tingly sensation go down her back.

Su Yang gently pushed Lu Youyi’s body down, and he began sucking on her b.r.e.a.s.ts once her body was laying on the bed.

"Aaaah~" Lu Youyi continued to m.o.a.n softly, feeling incredibly blissful right now even though they’d barely started.

A few moments later, Su Yang began making his way towards the lower parts of her body whilst his lips continued to kiss her delicate skin.

"Ahh!"

Lu Youyi subconsciously closed her legs when Su Yang reached the closed slit between her legs.

"Relax..." Su Yang said to her before licking the somewhat slimy slit, spreading it apart with his tongue.

"Oooh!"

After Su Yang’s lick, Lu Youyi suddenly felt all of the strength in her body disappear, almost as though it was absorbed by Su Yang.

Once Lu Youyi’s legs loosened, Su Yang began licking her slit with even more intensity, even drilling her tight hole with his tongue.

"Su Yang! Something’s coming out!" Lu Youyi warned him in a bashful voice.

"Go ahead and let it out."

A few seconds later, Lu Youyi released the force blocking her delight, allowing her Yin Qi to gush out like a broken dam.

"Aaaaaah~!"

Lu Youyi m.o.a.ned loudly as she soaked Su Yang with her Yin Qi.

Su Yang licked his lips afterward, tasting her Yin Qi.

After removing his clothes, Su Yang kneeled between her legs with his dragon pointing towards the ceiling.

"Heavens... What a massive..." Lu Youyi gasped in shock when she saw Su Yang’s bulging dragon that looked like it was threatening to tear the world apart.

Sometime later, Su Yang began rubbing his thick rod between Lu Youyi’s wet slit, bathing his dragon in her Yin Qi until it was soaking wet as well.

"Are you ready?" Su Yang asked her afterward.

"I am." Lu Youyi nodded.

Su Yang then poked her cave entrance with his dragon’s head.

’So big! It’s much bigger than I’d expected!’ Lu Youyi cried inwardly, unaware that it was just the tip.

Once the tip was inside, Su Yang began pushing his rod deeper into her cave, spreading her pink inner walls apart and tearing her maiden status apart.

A few seconds later, Su Yang’s entire rod was inside Lu Youyi’s body, and her maiden blood stained the white bedsheets, dyeing it crimson.

"I am going to start moving now," Su Yang said to her.

"Okay..." she nodded while gritting her teeth, trying her best to endure the intense pain coming from between her legs.

Su Yang began thrusting his h.i.p.s, shoving his rod in and out of her cave, staining the blankets with even more blood and Yin Qi.

"Aaah~"

"Aaahhh~!"

"Aaahn!"

Lu Youyi m.o.a.ned loudly, feeling pleasure and pain at the same time for a couple of minutes until she began getting used to the pain, feeling only pleasure.
