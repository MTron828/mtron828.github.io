Chapter 860 - Hong Yu'er's Decision

"I have been certain about my decision even before Senior Tang returned to her own body, Su Yang!" Hong Yu’er responded to him with a resolute expression on her face.

After a moment of silence, Su Yang burst out laughing, "Very well! I shall take you to the Divine Heavens with me. In fact, because of your dedication, I will even take you to meet Lingxi!"

"R-Really?! You’ll do that for me?!" Hong Yu’er’s eyes glistened with excitement, as this was her biggest worry about going to the Four Divine Heavens.

Su Yang nodded, "Yes, I don’t mind taking you with me. However, it won’t be immediately, and there’s no guarantee that you’ll even meet her."

"Huh? What do you mean by that?" Hong Yu’er raised her eyebrows in a confused manner.

"The portal that ’leads’ to the Four Divine Heavens isn’t guaranteed to take us to the Divine Heavens is what I am trying to say since we have no solid evidence that it does." Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

"Furthermore, even if we manage to reach the Four Divine Heavens, we won’t know where it’ll take us." Su Yang explained to her the situation.

"Oh, right... I forgot about that part..."

"Anyways, there’s still about two more months before we find out. What are you going to do until then?" Su Yang asked her a moment later.

"Can I stay in the Profound Blossom Sect? I already told my parents that I will be leaving the Hong Family so I don’t really have a place to stay anymore." Hong Yu’er said.

Su Yang nodded, "Okay, I don’t mind."

"Thank you, Su Yang." Hong Yu’er suddenly lowered her head and bowed to him.

Sometime later, Su Yang assigned a building to Hong Yu’er before returning to the Yin Yang Pavilion to tell Liu Lanzhi about Hong Yu’er’s presence.

"So she’s going to leave this world with you to go to the Four Divine Heavens?" Liu Lanzhi was surprised to hear this.

"That’s right."

"Why? She’s super popular in this world. She doesn’t mind leaving all of that behind?" Liu Lanzhi couldn’t fathom Hong Yu’er’s thoughts.

In her eyes, Hong Yu’er was the second most popular individual in their generation right behind Su Yang because of her high cultivation base and young age, not to mention her relationship with Su Yang.

"It’s complicated," Su Yang shrugged.

Once he returned to his own room, Lian Li also expressed the same surprise as Liu Lanzhi.

"What? She’s going to be coming with us to the Four Divine Heavens? And she even wants to be Senior Lingxi’s servant? Did Senior Lingxi affect her that much?"

"Trust me, I am still surprised after hearing it from her. I never thought Hong Yu’er would admire Tang Lingxi to such an extent."

"Do you think Sister Lingxi will accept Hong Yu’er as her servant?" Lian Li asked.

"Knowing her personality, most likely." Su Yang said.

"Really?"

"Think about it. Because of Hong Yu’er, she was able to reunite with me, and Lingxi is someone who hates having debts left unpaid. Therefore, in order to repay Hong Yu’er, she will accept Hong Yu’er as her servant."

"I see... That makes sense. But why didn’t you tell Hong Yu’er this?"

"I didn’t want to affect her passion. If I tell her that Lingxi will most definitely accept her, she might not feel as passionate about it. And I want to respect her decision and resolution." Su Yang said.

"Anyways, how is your body feeling? There’s a good chance you’ll give birth within the next three to four weeks." Su Yang then said.

"Full... I feel very full. That’s all I can really say." Lian Li chuckled.

"Are you excited?"

"Do you even have to ask?" Su Yang smiled as he rubbed her round stomach.

A few moments later, they began kissing each other.

After kissing for many minutes, Lian Li turned around with her n.a.k.e.d b.u.t.t sticking in the air.

"Go ahead, Su Yang... I want you inside me and fill me up..." Lian Li said to him.

Since she was very close to giving birth, Su Yang decided to use her rear end for now until after her birth.

Su Yang inserted his thick rod into her butthole a moment later, and they began cultivating with each other again after a short break.

The following day, Su Yang went to cultivate with Qiuyue.

"Hong Yu’er will be coming with us? And she wants to be Sister Lingxi’s servant? I don’t know what to say..." Qiuyue was dumbfounded by this news.

"It is what it is." Su Yang shrugged.

Sometime later after their cultivation, Qiuyue said to him, "After Lian Li’s delivery, I’ll be staying at the Southern Continent to keep watch of the mirror until we leave."

"Okay. I’ll leave it to you." Su Yang nodded.

After cultivating with Qiuyue, Su Yang went to cultivate with the other women in the Su Family, and he would continue this until he cultivated with all of them. Of course, he notified everyone about Hong Yu’er’s situation, and not a single one of them didn’t express surprise after hearing about it.

A few hours later, Su Yang returned to his room and cultivated all of the Yin Qi he’d absorbed from his cultivation sessions.

The following day, Su Yang called Xiao Rong into his room.

"It’s been a while since I fed you my Yang Qi. Do you want some now?" He asked her.

Obviously, she nodded her head.

A few moments later, Su Yang laid on the bed with Xiao Rong directly on top of him.

"Mmm..." Xiao Rong’s small body would tremble every once in a while, and her little sister would drool out Yin Qi a little bit faster.

Sometime later, whilst Xiao Rong was absorbed with s.u.c.k.i.n.g the Yang Qi out of Su Yang’s rod, she suddenly felt something poke her butthole, causing a chill to go down her spine.

"Master?" She stopped s.u.c.k.i.n.g his rod and turned around to look at him with raised eyebrows.

"Hm? You don’t like it?" Su Yang asked her.

"I don’t know..." She responded.

"Then why don’t we find out?" Su Yang said with a smile on his face.
