Chapter 648 - Two Beautiful Daughters

"Su Yang! I cannot believe it! You are really back!" When Zhu Mengyi saw Su Yang, she immediately rushed at him with teary eyes and a child in her arms.

However, she was not the only one who entered the room, as a second beauty entered the room a second later.

"Su Yang!" Wu Jingjing quickly approached him, also with a child in her arms.

"Huh? What are you doing here, Wu Jingjing?" Sect Master Zhu spoke after realizing that Zhu Mengyi did not return alone, as she did not expect Wu Jingjing to appear as well.

But alas, Wu Jingjing was too excited about Su Yang’s return to even pay attention to anything else, completely ignoring Sect Master Zhu.

Meanwhile, the Xie Family took a few steps back from shock and bewilderment, looking as though they were still trying to comprehend the situation.

"Zhu Mengyi, Wu Jingjing, it’s been a year," Su Yang said to the two beauties with a handsome on his face.

He then looked at the two cute female children in their arms and continued, "Congratulations on giving birth to the little ones. They are beautiful like their mothers."

Zhu Mengyi and Wu Jingjing showed a warm smile on their faces after hearing his words, and Zhu Mengyi spoke a moment later, "Thank you, Su Yang, for giving us such wonderful daughters."

"And thank you for allowing us to bear your child," Wu Jingjing said afterward.

"W-Wait a moment!" Sect Master Zhu suddenly cried out loud. "Wu Jingjing, what do you mean by that!? Your child also belongs to Su Yang?!"

Hearing her shocked voice, Wu Jingjing turned to look at her and nodded, "Sorry for not telling you sooner, Senior Zhu. My father was adamant on keeping it a secret even from you."

"That freaking old man! How dare he keep such a secret from me! I will definitely have a word with him later!" Sect Master Zhu gritted her teeth in anger.

"Mother! Calm down! You are scaring the babies!" Zhu Mengyi quickly warned her.

"Oh, my apologies..."

"Anyway, do you want to hold our daughter?" Zhu Mengyi asked Su Yang afterward. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

"If you don’t mind," he nodded.

Zhu Mengyi then carefully handed the little girl in her arms to Su Yang, who cradled the girl with slightly trembling hands. Although this is not his first time holding a baby, this is definitely his first time holding his own baby, which made him unexpectedly nervous.

"..."

Su Yang looked at the baby in his arms, and the baby silently stared at him in return, feeling some sort of connection with each other.

"Wow, this is the first time that she’s not crying after being held by someone that’s not me..." Zhu Mengyi expressed surprise after witnessing her daughter’s calmness, and she continued, "Maybe she can somehow tell that you’re her father..."

"What is her name, by the way?" Su Yang asked her.

"Zhu Jiayi, hoping that she will have an auspicious life."

"Zhu Mengyi and Zhu Jiayi, huh? I like it," Su Yang nodded.

After holding Zhu Jiayi for a few moments, he noticed a small pair of eyes staring at him intensively, causing him to look at the baby in Wu Jingjing’s arms.

"Hahaha... What a pair of sharp gaze— she’ll definitely become a powerful swordmaster in the future." Su Yang laughed loudly after seeing this.

"Do you also want me to hold you?" he then asked the baby, who surprisingly responded by wiggling her body.

"Here you go, Su Yang..." Fearing that the baby might wiggle out of her arm, Wu Jingjing quickly passed the baby onto Su Yang before saying, "Her name’s Wu Min, as in quick and sharp like a sword."

Once Wu Min was in Su Yang’s embrace, she immediately stopped wiggling and silently stared at Su Yang, looking just like Zhu Jiayi.

"Zhu Jiayi and Wu Min... What a mysterious feeling..."

Now with his own creation in each of his arms, Su Yang was experiencing a feeling that he has never felt before.

Zhu Mengyi and Wu Jingjing sat down beside before asking him questions such as:

"Where have you been for the last year and a half, Su Yang?"

"Why did you return to this place?"

"I thought you wouldn’t be back for a long, long time."

After listening to their question, Su Yang proceeded to explain to them the situation and that he’s actually from the Eastern Continent.

"Unbelievable... To think you were actually from the Eastern Continent..." They covered their mouths in surprise.

"So they must be..."

The two girls turned to look at the Xie Family that had been silently standing in the corner with blank expressions on their faces, and their gaze stopped at Xie Xingfang after seeing her flawless figure, wondering to themselves what her relationship was with Su Yang.

"Uhh... Su Yang... I know you don’t owe us any explanations, but would you mind telling us what is happening here?" Xie Wang suddenly asked him.

"What are you confused about?" Su Yang asked them with raised eyebrows, acting ignorantly.

"You... those children... Are they really...?" Xie Wang spoke in a stuttering voice.

"Yes, they are mine. Is there a problem with that?" he casually responded.

"No, but knowing your playboy nature, it’s actually quite shocking that you’d be willing to have children." Lord Xie suddenly spoke.

"I know what you mean, but things can always change," Su Yang spoke.

Meanwhile, Xie Xingfang remained silent, seemingly in deep thoughts.

Sometime later, Sect Master Zhu said, "Anyway, I am going to write a message for the Lian Family requesting an audience for you. It’ll take a day or two at most for a response, but you can stay here in the meantime. I’ll also arrange your living quarters."

"Su Yang, you can stay in my living quarters like before," Zhu Mengyi quickly said to him.

"Okay," he nodded.

"Can I also stay with you for a while?" Wu Jingjing asked.

"Of course!" Zhu Mengyi immediately responded.
