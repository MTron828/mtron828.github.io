Chapter 669 - Admitting Defeat

’As much as I want to see for myself what his Sword Will can do, I have this ominous feeling in my gut that’s telling me to retreat from this sword battle and admit defeat...’ Wu Jiang pondered with a deep frown on his face.

In the midst of Wu Jiang’s thoughts, Su Yang suddenly spoke, "Ah, I forgot to mention this but due to my insufficient cultivation base, I do not have perfect control over my Sword Will, so if I accidentally kill you or destroy this sect, you can’t blame me, okay?"

"L-Like hell I am going to let you do that!" Wu Jiang quickly exclaimed before saying, "Fine! I admit defeat! If neither Sword Intent nor Sword Qi works on you, I will lose regardless of what I do due to the rules of this battle!"

However, just as Wu Jiang prepared to leave, Su Yang stopped him and said, "Wait! You think you can leave just like that?"

"What else do you want from me?" Wu Jiang looked at him with a frown.

Su Yang did not respond and merely pointed at Wu Jingjing.

"..."

Wu Jiang immediately knew his intentions and took a deep breath before saying in a loud voice, "Wu Jingjing! I was wrong and you were right! It turns out that I was the blind one all long! Although he is a little arrogant and daring, he has the abilities to back his arrogance, and I cannot imagine someone more fitting than him to be your husband!"

"Father..." Wu Jingjing covered her mouth after hearing his words, even feeling the urge to cry.

"Are you satisfied now? I won’t try to separate you two anymore, and regarding the issue with the Lian Family, I will have a talk with Emperor Lian later," Wu Jiang said to Su Yang. "Though, I cannot guarantee you that anything will come out of it."

"There’s no need for you to speak with my father, Master!" Lian Li’s voice suddenly resounded.

"Oh? You’re awake already?" Su Yang looked at her with a smile on his face.

"Hmph! Even a dead man would wake up if he was buried so close to your fight!" Lian Li responded while wearing the Profound Blossom Sect’s disciple robes on her body.

"Anyway, since I have lost my sword battle with him, regardless of how it happened, I will keep my words and act as though nothing had occurred today! However, that does not mean my father will sit still once he learns of this! If he does decide to punish him, I won’t help him, as that is not a part of our agreement!"

After a moment of silence, Su Yang said, "I think you’re missing something."

"..."

Lian Li immediately narrowed her eyes to glare at him with an annoyed gaze.

"I know! I will have dinner with you tonight!" she shouted sometime later.

The disciples there gasped in shock after they heard Lian Li’s words. They didn’t think that she would actually agree to such a ridiculous request.

’Hmph! Just you wait! I will make you regret humiliating me in front of so many people!’ Lian Li thought to herself before disappearing from the area shortly later.

"What are you going to do now?" Wu Jiang asked Su Yang afterward.

"Who knows. Our purpose for coming here was to introduce myself to you, but since we have accomplished that and some more..." Su Yang then looked at Wu Jingjing and continued, "What should we do now?"

"There are still a few things I need to tell you, father. We should talk about it elsewhere." Wu Jingjing said.

Wu Jiang nodded before speaking in a loud voice, "You are all dismissed!"

Hearing the Sect Master’s command, the disciples in the arena immediately dispersed and returned to whatever they were doing previously.

Sometime later, Wu Jiang brought Wu Jingjing and Su Yang to the Sect Master’s quarters.

"So? What do you want to talk to me about?" Wu Jiang looked at them with a serious expression.

Wu Jingjing looked at Su Yang for a brief moment before speaking with a serious expression on her face, "I... I am going to leave the Holy Central Continent with Su Yang."

"Huh? W-Wait a second... I don’t understand..." Wu Jiang looked at them with a dumbfounded look on his face. "Even if you are going to follow him, why do you have to leave the continent?"

"Because Su Yang is not from the Holy Central Continent, father. He came from the Eastern Continent," she said to him.

"T-The Eastern Continent?!?!" Wu Jiang stood up from shock. "How the hell did you manage to cross the Jade Sea?"

"I flew here on a flying boat," he casually said.

"A flying boat...?" Wu Jiang quickly frowned. He can only recall another person who has such a treasure.

Su Yang smiled after seeing Wu Jiang’s reaction, and he spoke, "Immortal Fairy Su Yue— you asked me if I knew her, right? I kind of lied to you."

"What?! So you are— you really are her husband?!" Wu Jiang exclaimed.

"Huh?" Wu Jingjing turned to look at Su Yang with wide eyes. "You... You were Immortal Fairy Su Yue’s..." ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

"Oh, no. We’re not married— that’s just a story she made up. Though, we do have a special relationship," he briefly explained.

"B-But you know Immortal Fairy Su Yue?" Wu Jingjing stared at him with awe in her eyes, as she had been dying to meet the renowned Immortal Fairy.

"Where is she right now? Immortal Fairy Su Yue!" Wu Jiang suddenly asked him.

"She’s in the Eastern Continent," he said.

"No wonder why nobody has seen her lately! Because she’s actually on another continent!" Wu Jiang shook his head after realizing this.

"Anyway, you want to follow Su Yang back to the Eastern Continent? How often will you visit me? You think I’m going to let you take my granddaughter away from me without a fight?" Wu Jiang looked at her with narrowed eyes.

"Well... About that..." Wu Jingjing turned to look at Su Yang with a hopeless gaze.

Seeing this, Su Yang smiled and said, "Even though I am from the Eastern Continent, I do not actually belong to this world."

"Eh? What the hell do you mean by that?" Wu Jiang quickly asked.
