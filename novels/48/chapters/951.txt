Chapter 952 Two Months

"Dear, it’s about time for me to leave. I have already stayed here for longer than I had liked," Luo Ziyi said to him after the massage parlor closed down for the day.

Su Yang nodded and said, "Thank you for all your help. I wouldn’t have made it to this point so quickly without your help."

"If you want to thank me, you can do so by staying safe and coming back to us soon," she then said.

"I will return once everything is prepared and I am able to— I promise."

Luo Ziyi then gave Su Yang a passionate kiss on the lips and then said afterward, "Once I return, I will let the others know what you told me. I don’t know when they’ll visit you, but expect a visit from them soon." Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Luo Ziyi then handed him a storage ring.

"Here’s some money if you need it. I know you don’t like to rely on others too much, especially if you don’t need to so I didn’t give you anything too grand. However, it’s better to have them when you need them than when you need them but don’t have any."

"Thank you. I will accept it." Su Yang accepted the storage ring, but he didn’t look inside, as he wanted to keep it a surprise for when he needed it.

After kissing Su Yang one more time, Luo Ziyi left the massage parlor and disappeared from the city.

Once she was far away and alone, Luo Ziyi removed her disguise and started returning to the sect with her flying treasure.

Whoosh!

The flying treasure flew straight into the starry sky and then towards the Celestial Heaven, traveling between Divine Heavens without using any teleport formations.

A week later, Luo Ziyi returned to the sect and summoned the others.

"Sister Ziyi! You have finally returned! I was getting anxious waiting!" The family quickly gathered at her living quarters.

After Luo Ziyi concealed their place with a formation, she began telling them about her adventure with Su Yang.

"You had such an adventure with Su Yang? How envious..."

"Sister Ziyi, did you ask Su Yang about whether or not we can visit him?"

Luo Ziyi nodded, "Of course. I wouldn’t forget about something so important."

"Well? What did he say!?" The ladies stared at her with anticipation in their gaze.

Luo Ziyi smiled and said, "He said it’s okay if you visit him—"

"Yes!"

The room instantly became filled with excitement from the goddesses that were acting like a bunch of children who just got approval to leave the house so that they could play with their friends outside.

"Let me finish." Luo Ziyi said to them after giving them a moment to rejoice.

"Su Yang gave all of us permission to visit him, but only one person can visit him at a time, and you must be disguised when you visit him."

"That’s fine. We were already prepared to do that much and even more if we got to see him." One of them said.

"The real question is... Who gets to visit him first?" Wang Yunxuan suddenly said.

The place instantly turned dead silent with everyone in the room exchanging glances, and the atmosphere there suddenly became heavy, almost as though a war was about to begin.

"Calm down." Luo Ziyi was the first to break the silence, and she continued, "We can decide the order through a lottery draw. This way, we don’t have to fight each other to decide."

"A lottery draw?" They looked at her with raised eyebrows.

"Yes. In fact, I already have everything prepared."

Luo Ziyi then retrieved a dozen round rocks and placed them on the table.

"Inside each of these rocks is a number— from one to twelve. You will each pick one rock, and whatever number you get is your position in the queue to meet Su Yang."

"And don’t even bother trying to cheat. Your spiritual sense won’t work on these rocks." Luo Ziyi said to them.

Of course, all of them have tried to peek inside the rock way before Luo Ziyi even said that sentence, but alas, they were unable to see anything.

"Go ahead. Pick one." Luo Ziyi then said to them.

After swallowing nervously, each of the goddesses picked a rock randomly.

Once everyone there had a rock in their hand, they all smashed it simultaneously, revealing a piece of paper inside.

"Yes! I am first!" One of them suddenly exclaimed when she saw the number ’one’ on her paper.

"Damn it! I got number seven?!"

"Why have the heavens abandoned me? What did I do to deserve the last place?"

A few of them were satisfied with their result— mostly the ones that picked a low number, while the others cursed their bad luck.

The goddess that got number twelve even cried slightly when she saw the number.

"Sister Ziyi, when can I visit Su Yang?" The lucky lady who managed to get the number ’one’ asked her afterward.

"You can visit him whenever you want." Luo Ziyi said.

"Then I will go right now!"

"Wait just a moment!" Someone suddenly stopped her.

And then she continued, "We still need to decide how long we each get to spend with Su Yang! It shouldn’t be too long so that the rest of us won’t have to wait years before we can see him, nor should it be so short that we leave unsatisfied."

"How long did Sister Ziyi spend with Su Yang? We can use her as the standard." Wang Yunxuan suggested.

"If you only count the time I was actually with him, then about two months, give or take." Luo Ziyi said.

"How does two months sound, everyone?" Wang Yunxuan asked them.

"Although it’s a little shorter than I’d hoped... I guess so." One of them agreed.

"I also don’t mind. If you think about it, two months is actually a lot of time, especially when we usually only get to spend about a week with him at most before he leaves to somewhere in the Divine Heavens, and then we won’t see him for a few more years."

"If you say it like that, two months is actually a lot of time... I agree with this amount of time!" Another one agreed.

Eventually, everyone agreed on spending two months with Su Yang each.
