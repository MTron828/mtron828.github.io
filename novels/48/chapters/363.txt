\"Sect Master! We have an emergency! We have an emergency!!!\"

\"What is it?\" Fu Kuan looked at the Sect Elder that urgently called for him with a frown, clearly still angry about Great Elder Ren‚Äôs death.

\"It‚Äôs the Heavenly Swan Sect! They... they formed an Alliance with the Profound Blossom Sect!\" The Sect Elder revealed the news to Fu Kuan, whose eyes widened with shock upon hearing that.

\"What?! Impossible!\"

\"It‚Äôs true! Bai Lihua, their Sect Master, has announced it herself just now! They said that the Profound Blossom Sect is now under their protection, as they have formed an Alliance with each other!\"

\"Those bastards! Because of Great Elder Ren‚Äôs death, they dared to side with the Profound Blossom Sect despite knowing that it‚Äôll offend us!\" Fu Kuan cursed loudly.

\"What about our feud with the Profound Blossom Sect? Are we still going to war with them?\" The Sect Elder asked him with a worried expression.

Although the Million Snakes Sect is known to be a top powerhouse even among the Elite Sects, without Great Elder Ren, they are now in the middle if not the bottom of the rank among the Elite Sects.

If the Million Snakes Sect still wants to wage war with the Profound Blossom Sect that is now protected by the Heavenly Swan Sect, a top Elite Sect like them, they will certainly have a lot of casualties. What‚Äôs more, they might even not come out to be the victor of the war.

\"We will!\"

After a moment of hesitation, Fu Kuan declared with his eyes bloodshot.

\"Although we will have some casualties, we won‚Äôt lose! Even if we have to reveal to the world our trump card, we will destroy the Profound Blossom Sect and the Heavenly Swan Sect!\"

\"What?! Our trump card?! But that‚Äôs for the Xie Family...\" The Sect Elder was shocked by Fu Kuan‚Äôs unwavering resolve to fight the Profound Blossom Sect.

\"So what?! We can just delay our plans for another few years! It won‚Äôt make any difference! The Profound Blossom Sect, however, must disappear as soon as possible!\"

\"But once the Xie Family learns of our trump card, they will surely pay closer attention to us! Once they happen, our plans might leak!\"

\"You don‚Äôt have to worry about that.\" Fu Kuan said with a fierce voice. \"There are only very few individuals within the sect that know of the plan. If there‚Äôs any suspicion from any of them, I will eliminate them without hesitation.\"

\"Yes, Sect Master!\" The Sect Elder bowed, as he was afraid that if he tried to convince Fu Kuan any more, it‚Äôll make it look like he‚Äôs trying to protect the Profound Blossom Sect and be eliminated by Fu Kuan.

However, literally an hour later, the news of the Burning Lotus Sect forming an Alliance with the Profound Blossom Sect also spread, causing the Fu Kuan to stomp the ground in anger, nearly destroying the entire floor.

\"Fuck! Not just the Heavenly Swan Sect but even the Burning Lotus Sect is trying to fuck with me?!\" Fu Kuan couldn‚Äôt help but curse loudly. \"This has to be a conspiracy! The Elite Sects must be trying to get rid of the Million Snakes Sect, and Great Elder Ren‚Äôs death has influenced them to finally move!\"

\"What should we do now, Sect Elder? Even with our trump card, it‚Äôll be near impossible to fight with two Elite Sects at the same time without Great Elder Ren. Not to mention there‚Äôs also that Immortal at the Profound Blossom Sect.\"

\"...\"

Fu Kuan was speechless. He‚Äôs never felt this cornered before, not even during the many life-or-death situations that he‚Äôs been in before.

\"Give me some time to think about it...\" Fu Kuan finally said after a few minutes of silence.

The Sect Elder nodded and left Fu Kuan alone.

Meanwhile, inside one of the rooms at the Snow Crystal Hotel, Liu Lanzhi dropped onto the bed with an exhausted expression and a body covered in sweat.

\"Haaa... haaa... haaa... Su Yang... just how are you this good at dual cultivation? It‚Äôs almost like you have thousands of years of experience.\" Liu Lanzhi asked him while breathing heavily. N√™ww ùíÑhapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(ùíÜ)l/bin(.)com

After just one hour of dual cultivation, Su Yang has completely drained her body of its energy and Yin Qi. It was a record for Liu Lanzhi, who has always been the one to exhaust her partners first.

\"And compared to our first time doing cultivation at the Inner Court Disciple Examination, your Yang Qi has increased significantly in quality. In fact, it‚Äôs so rich that even I cannot tell its quality properly anymore. If we continue to cultivate, I should enter the sixth level of the Earth Spirit Realm next week! It‚Äôs no wonder why the disciples‚Äô cultivation base exploded!\" Liu Lanzhi exclaimed while she looked at his Yang Qi that was overflowing out of her pink hole.

\"I read a few books about dual cultivation, that‚Äôs all.\" Su Yang said to her with a mysterious smile on his face.

\"Hmph! If you can become so experienced just by reading books, then every disciple would have been as good as you!\" Liu Lanzhi snorted after hearing his obvious farting.

Sometime later, Su Yang said to her, \"By the way, I have something to tell you. It‚Äôs regarding the future of the Profound Blossom Sect.\"

\"Hmm? What is it?\"

\"I plan on making the Profound Blossom Sect a mixed Sect,\" he said.

\"Mixed? What do you mean by that?\" Liu Lanzhi tilted her head with a puzzled look, as she has never heard of this before.

\"It‚Äôs as it sounds. The Profound Blossom Sect will split its disciples into two different sections in the future. One side will practice dual cultivation, whilst the other side will practice normal cultivation. Of course, the Sect itself will remain as one place.\"

\"May I ask why you would want to split the disciples?\" Even if it will completely change the Profound Blossom Sect and its legacy, Liu Lanzhi did not immediately refuse his idea and kept an open mind.

Su Yang nodded and proceeded to explain to her the reason behind his idea.
