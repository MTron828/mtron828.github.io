"Hey, Su Yang... do you have a wife yet? Or partners you are dedicated to?" Feng Xindou suddenly asked him as he got dressed.

"Yes, I do— many, in fact." He answered without hesitation. "Why do you ask?"

"Well, I have a daughter who is just as beautiful if not even more beautiful than me, and I was wondering if you would be willing to consider taking her as one of your partners. Although she can be a bit of a hassle sometimes, she’s not a bad girl, and I’m sure that she’ll be a great addition to your family." Feng Xindou said, surprisingly offering her own daughter to him.

"Oh? I am willing to listen to your reasons right now," Su Yang said with a mysterious smile on his face.

"As much as I want to become your woman, I am already married to a faithful husband, and while he has neglected me for some time now, I know that he still cares about me deeply, or he would’ve long given up on me and found another woman to marry."

"However, my daughter, Lian Li... she’s still a pure maiden as far as I’m aware, and I am simply trying to fulfill my job as a mother by finding a suitable partner for her," Feng Xindou explained to him.

Hearing her words, Su Yang suddenly approached her and caressed her face while speaking in a seducing voice, "So what you’re saying is... you don’t want to become my woman? If you become my woman, I can satisfy your lust every day, and you even get to experience much better things than what happened today."

"..."

Feng Xindou looked at him with a surprised face, seemingly shocked speechless by his sudden approach.

"I-If you say something like that, I will really..."

However, before Feng Xindou could finish her sentence, Su Yang gave her a gentle but passionate kiss on the lips for a good moment before distancing himself.

Su Yang then said to her in a calm voice, "That was a farewell kiss. If it was a few thousand years ago, when I was still seducing every woman I set my eyes on without a care for the world, I would’ve definitely taken you for myself. However, you still have a caring husband, and I only take away women from those who don’t deserve them."

"As for your daughter, Lian Li... I will think about it."

"A few thousand years ago...?"

Feng Xindou stared at him with wide eyes filled with wonder, and she pondered inwardly, ’Just who are you, Su Yang...?’

However, before she could ask him that question, Su Yang was already opening the door.

"I will let them know that you’ve completely recovered so you can come out whenever you are ready," Su Yang said to her before leaving the room and closing the door.

Once Su Yang left her alone, Feng Xindou laid on the bed while staring at the ceiling with a dazed look.

’If only I had met you earlier...’ she sighed inwardly.

Meanwhile, standing outside Feng Xindou’s room were Emperor Lian and the Heavenly Spirit Realm Cultivators with a few extra additions— unfamiliar faces Su Yang is seeing for the first time.

"Su Yang! How is my wife?!" Emperor Lian quickly asked after seeing Su Yang leave the room, his heart beating so hard it could be considered having an anxiety attack.

"Calm down, your wife is fine, and she has completely recovered from her condition." Su Yang said with a calm expression.

"R-Really?! T-Thank heavens!" Emperor Lian felt the strength in his legs disappear, causing him to fall onto the floor with tears in his eyes.

"Heavens! Am I hearing this right?! Her Majesty has actually recovered after being treated by him?!" The unfamiliar faces exclaimed in shocked voices.

"Who are you guys?" Su Yang asked them with raised eyebrows.

"W-We are the doctors that have been trying to treat Her Majesty but to no avail! Please! Can you tell us how you treated her condition?!" The doctors asked him.

"Oh, so you’re the useless bunch that couldn’t even cure a single woman, huh? Well, if you want to know how I treated her, you should ask her yourself." Su Yang shook his head.

"U-Useless bunch...?" The doctors there were speechless, as their first time being cursed at by someone that was not Emperor Lian! They were all renowned doctors respected by the majority of the people in the Holy Central Continent, too!

"I am going to see my wife!" Emperor Lian said as he approached the room.

However, he was immediately stopped by Su Yang, who blocked his path with a single arm.

"W-What is the meaning of this? If she’s healed, why can’t I see her?" Emperor Lian asked him with a puzzled frown.

"There’s no need to be so impatient. She will come out when she’s ready. However, if you insist on going in now, I won’t be responsible for whatever happens afterward," Su Yang shook his head.

"I-Is that so..." Emperor Lian looked at him with a dazed face, unsure how he should feel about this.

"Why don’t you get me my Four Elements Root in the meantime? You can hand it to me after you see your wife later if you are still doubtful," Su Yang said to Emperor Lian, and he continued a moment later, "Anyway, where are the others?"

"They should be resting in the guest room with my daughter," Emperor Lian said.

"Somebody bring him to the guest room! And one of you prepare the Four Elements Root!" Emperor Lian said to the Heavenly Spirit Realm Cultivators.

"Yes, Your Majesty!"

Even when Su Yang was gone, Emperor Lian continued to wait in front of Feng Xindou’s room.

Many minutes later, the door suddenly opened, and a beautiful woman wearing majestic robes walked out of the room, bearing a domineering aura around her that was fitting of an Empress.

"M-My wife! Y-You have really recovered!" Seeing her beautiful figure, Emperor Lian immediately approached her, yet he didn’t dare to touch her, fearing that her body was still weak.

"I’m sorry for making you worry, my dear..." Feng Xindou said to him with a gentle smile on her face.
