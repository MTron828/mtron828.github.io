Chapter 970 That Was Just the Tip

"Are you ready?" Su Yang asked Feng Tianwei as he and his majestic dragon stood before her.

Feng Tianwei swallowed nervously before nodding her head slowly.

Su Yang then got onto the mattress and positioned himself right between her slender legs.

Once he was comfortable, Su Yang began rubbing his hot rod between her slit that was drooling with Yin Qi.

A moment later, once his rod was soaking wet with her Yin Qi, Su Yang inserted the tip of his dragon head into Feng Tianwei’s cave.

"Aaah!"

Feng Tianwei’s body suddenly began trembling, and her lower body gushed with Yin Qi.

"Hmm? You came already? That was just the tip." Su Yang said with a smile on his face.

He then started slowly drilling deeper inside her cave with his divine rod.

The deeper Su Yang’s rod reached, the more Feng Tianwei’s body released Yin Qi.

Su Yang’s tip eventually reached the deepest part of her caves, but even then, there was some space left on his rod.

Feng Tianwei’s cave was smaller than he’d anticipated, but the tightness of it was just as he’d expected.

"I will start moving now." Su Yang said as he began pulling his rod out of her cave.

"Mmm~!"

However, Feng Tianwei’s suction was so powerful that it immediately pulled his rod back inside her cave.

Su Yang smiled and started thrusting his hips with more force.

"Aaaah~!"

"Aaah~!"

Intense moaning filled the room, and Feng Tianwei felt as though she was in heaven.

Thirty minutes passed by in a flash as Feng Tianwei was completely absorbed in their cultivation session, and Su Yang didn’t stop moving his hips even for a second the entire team.

The number of times Feng Tianwei climaxed during their thirty-minute session was too much to count, but it was definitely enough to compensate for 200 years of being unable to climax.

Su Yang unplugged his rod from Feng Tianwei’s hole, and his Yang Qi flowed from within alongside her Yin Qi.

"You can rest here for tonight." Su Yang retrieved a blanket and covered her trembling body.

Feng Tianwei didn’t say anything and closed her eyes, quickly falling asleep.

Su Yang then left the store and locked the doors before making his way to the hotel.

"It’s me." Su Yang knocked on the doors.

"Welcome, Manager!" Mei Xing greeted him a moment later.

"I am here to give you another massage." Su Yang said to Mei Ying, who was sitting up on the bed.

"I will be troubling you again." Mei Ying nodded.

"I will continue studying the cultivation technique!" Mei Xing said as she sat on the floor and returned to studying the cultivation technique Su Yang gave her.

"Make sure you don’t stay up too long, or what happened last time will repeat itself." Mei Ying said to her.

"I know, mother. I won’t stay up all night."

Once Mei Xing started focusing on her cultivation technique, Mei Ying removed her clothes and laid on the bed. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Su Yang then created a formation around the bed so that they don’t disturb Mei Xing’s concentration.

"Eh? My scars... They’re gone?" Mei Ying suddenly realized that all of the bruises and scars on her body had disappeared.

"The pill I gave you not only heals your body but also your wounds," Su Yang said to her.

"Such a powerful pill, it must have been expensive..." Mei Ying felt an urge to cry again while also feeling incredibly guilty for using so much of Su Yang’s resources without doing anything in return for him.

"It’s nothing much. I got it for free, anyway." Su Yang chuckled.

If Mei Ying knew that it was a pill personally concocted by the God of Alchemy herself, who knows how she would react, as such a pill would go for millions of high-grade spirit stones.

Su Yang began massaging her body shortly after, and her body felt vastly different compared to when he touched it during their last massage, almost like it was a new body altogether.

After the massage, Mei Ying quickly fell asleep on the bed.

Once Su Yang covered her body with the blankets, he removed the formation and turned to look at Mei Xing, who was still fully absorbed in studying the cultivation technique.

Su Yang decided to not bother her and went into another room.

Although he rented this hotel for Mei Ying and Mei Xing, since there was a second bedroom, he might as well use it.

The following morning, Su Yang left the room to see Mei Xing still sitting in the exact same spot.

Clearly, she’d skipped another night of sleep, but it wasn’t intentional, she Mei Xing was simply so absorbed in her studies that she didn’t realize how much time had actually passed.

"Hey, Mei Xing." Su Yang approached her.

"Eh? Manager? Oh, right. I should go to sleep now," she said, completely unaware that it was already a new day.

Su Yang chuckled and pointed at the windows.

Mei Xing followed his fingers, and to her surprise, there was light coming from the windows.

"You didn’t sleep again," he revealed to her the truth.

"O-Oh no! It didn’t even feel that long when I was studying the technique!" Mei Xing exclaimed.

"Don’t worry, that happens more often than you think when one is absorbed in their studies, especially when it comes to cultivation techniques. Sometimes, years could have passed but it would still feel like days."

Mei Xing then turned to look at her mother, who was sleeping peacefully in the bed.

"D-Does mother..."

"No, she doesn’t know... yet..."

"M-Manager! Can you please keep this a secret? I don’t want to worry her, and I promise this won’t happen again." she pleaded.

Su Yang smiled and said, "I wouldn’t make that promise if I were you because you will definitely break it, as it will happen again. It’s an inevitable thing that all cultivators experience— losing track of time, that is."

"T-Then what should I do, Manager?"

"Unfortunately, there’s nothing you can do but accept it whenever it happens. Though, you will be able to control it in the future once you’re capable enough." Su Yang said.
