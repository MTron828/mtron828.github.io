Luo Yixiao knocked on Cai Yan’s door after settling in her new home. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

A few moments later, Cai Yan opened the door, and to her surprise, Luo Yixiao greeted her with a smile, "Hello, Cai Yan. I’m here to let you know that I will be your neighbor from now on."

"Huh?" Cai Yan did not immediately comprehend Luo Yixiao’s words and stood there with a dazed face for a good moment.

"Y-You’re going to be living here? In the Profound Blossom Sect? Don’t tell me that you’d also decided to cultivate with our Master?" Cai Yan asked her afterward.

"No... I decided to stay in the Profound Blossom Sect so that I can receive extra lectures from Master. And you..." Luo Yixiao didn’t notice this at first but after looking at Cai Yan for some time, she’d noticed that Cai Yan’s aura was much fiercer than a month ago!

"Cai Yan! Your cultivation base! It increased by two whole levels! But it’s only been a month since our last meeting! How is that possible?!" Luo Yixiao exclaimed in a dumbfounded voice.

"Impressive, right?" Cai Yan spoke with a prideful expression on her face, and she continued a moment later, "This is the result of cultivating with Master nearly every single day! I’ll definitely reach the Earth Spirit Realm in another three months at this rate, and I’ll finally be able to start using my Jade Flames for alchemy! I cannot wait!"

Hearing Cai Yan’s excited words, Luo Yixiao couldn’t help but mumble in a dazed voice, "Is it really that effective? ’Cultivating’ with Master?"

Cai Yan nodded without hesitation and spoke in a shameless voice, "Master’s Yang Qi is incredibly potent and rich with spiritual energy; it’s unlike anything I’ve experienced before. And every time he releases it inside my body, it feels as though I’d consumed a priceless treasure."

"R-Release it inside your body...?" Luo Yixiao’s mouth opened slightly, and she asked a moment later, "Aren’t you... aren’t you afraid of getting pregnant? If you become pregnant from cultivation, it’ll hinder your life as an alchemist."

"No, it’ll be fine as long as you absorb and cultivate the Yang Qi before it fertilizes you. Furthermore, Master is able to control his Yang Qi so he won’t fertilize me by accident. And even if he does accidentally impregnate me, I have already asked him to impregnate me before so it won’t matter too much," Cai Yan revealed everything to Luo Yixiao with a calm expression on her face.

"You what?!" Luo Yixiao’s eyes widened with shock and disbelief. "Aren’t you cultivating with him just to improve your cultivation? Why did you ask him to impregnate you then? And how did Master respond? Did he agree?"

Cai Yan nodded and said with a smile on her face, "Yes, Master agreed to impregnate me, and this is also my parent’s wish."

"Unbelievable..." Luo Yixiao mumbled, clearly speechless.

After speaking with Cai Yan for a few more minutes, Luo Yixiao returned to her own home. However, she did not start practicing her alchemy like she normally would. Instead, she laid on the comfortable bed and stared at the ceiling with a dazed look on her pretty face, seemingly pondering about many things.

After pondering for many minutes, Luo Yixiao finally got off the bed and began practicing her alchemy skills.

Time passed quickly within the Profound Blossom Sect, and two more months had passed in the blink of an eye.

During this time, nothing notable has happened, and besides cultivating with the disciples and his women, Su Yang hasn’t really left the Profound Blossom Sect besides picking up Senior Zeng for lectures, going to the Heavenly Swan Sect to cultivate with Bai Lihua and Su Yin, and cultivating with Wang Shuren at the Burning Lotus Sect.

"Darling... I am going to leave this body and return to my original body in three days. I can already feel my control over Hong Yu’er’s body weakening. If it wasn’t for the fact that she’s willingly allowing me to use her body, she could probably already force me out of her body even now." Tang Lingxi suddenly said to Su Yang one day in the morning.

"Is that so? What are you going to do now?" Su Yang asked her.

"As I’d said before, there’s really nothing I can do when I am in this body. However, I’d like to spend the rest of my time here beside you," Tang Lingxi said to him with a bitter smile on her face.

Su Yang pondered for a moment before nodding his head and speaking, "Very well, I shall be by your side until you return to the Divine Heavens. In fact, let’s leave the Profound Blossom Sect and go somewhere we can be alone for the next three days."

"Okay." Tang Lingxi said.

Su Yang then went to find Liu Lanzhi before telling her about the situation.

"I understand. I’ll protect the Profound Blossom Sect until you return. Though, I doubt anything will happen even if you disappear for an entire year..." Liu Lanzhi said with a bittersweet smile on her face, feeling as though she wasn’t being useful despite being the Sect Master.

After leaving Liu Lanzhi’s room, Su Yang notified the disciples as well as his family that he will be unavailable for the next three days.

Once everything was prepared, Su Yang returned to his room where Tang Lingxi was waiting patiently.

"Shall we go, my dear Lingxi?" Su Yang extended his hand for her.

"Yes, darling." Tang Lingxi grabbed his hand with a sweet smile on her face.

A few moments later, Su Yang and Tang Lingxi left the Yin Yang Pavilion and flew away, disappearing from the Profound Blossom Sect.

After leaving the Profound Blossom Sect, the two of them flew without stopping until they reached the peak of a tall but lonely mountain in the middle of nowhere.

"What do you think? This place seems fitting enough, as our first meeting was also on a mountain in the middle of nowhere," Su Yang said to her with a smile on his face.

"It’s perfect," Tang Lingxi nodded, and they proceeded to land on the top of the mountain a moment later.
