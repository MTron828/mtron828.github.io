Chapter 722 Real Daughters

"I-Immortal Fairy Su Yue!" Wu Jingjing and the other ladies unconsciously took a step back after seeing the frown on Qiuyue’s face, as they recall how ruthless she could be whenever she’s annoyed, and she looked incredibly annoyed right now.

"What is the meaning of this? Why are the three of you here?" Qiuyue asked them after a moment of silence.

"Well... Immortal Fairy Su Yue..."

"Don’t call me that!" Qiuyue quickly interrupted.

The three ladies exchanged glances with each other, clearly in a bind.

"Why are you making things difficult for them, Qiuyue? You should already know why they’re here..." Su Yang approached her and said.

"..."

Qiuyue looked at him for a second before turning to look at Wu Min and Zhu Jiayi.

"Don’t tell me..." She looked at Su Yang again, her gaze filled with shock.

"That’s right. They’re my daughters. I impregnated them during our previous visit to the Holy Central Continent," Su Yang said to her.

"..."

Qiuyue immediately became speechless with a perplexed expression on her face.

Seeing this, Su Yang took this moment to introduce her to the other three goddesses.

"Although you may already know her as Immortal Fairy Su Yue, her real name is Qiuyue, and she’s originally from the Divine Heavens like me," Su Yang said to them, and he continued, "However, due to some events in the Divine Heavens, she somehow managed to arrive in this place and has been here ever since."

"Umm... Immortal— Senior Qiuyue... It’s a pleasure to finally see you..." Lian Li bowed to her.

"Although you may not recognize me, I am..."

"You’re Emperor Lian’s daughter, right? I remember you." Qiuyue quickly said to her. "There’s no need for any introduction. I know every single one of you— Lian Li, Zhu Mengyi, and Wu Jingjing."

Qiuyue then turned to look at Su Yang and asked him, "Since they are here, it means they are going to follow us back to the Divine Heavens, right?"

"Un." Su Yang nodded.

Qiuyue turned to look at Su Yang’s two daughters again before sighing inwardly, ’Father’s real daughters, huh? If only I was also...’

"Do whatever you want," Qiuyue said a moment later before turning around and returning to the Yin Yang Pavilion and her room.

"T-That was surprising... I didn’t expect Immortal Fairy— Senior Qiuyue to appear in front of us so suddenly..." Zhu Mengyi sighed in relief afterward. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

"Yes. And it felt like she’d gotten more grumpy than before..." Wu Jingjing said with a smile on her face.

"Hahaha! Don’t worry about her cold attitude— she does that when she’s not able to express her emotions properly. You’ll get used to her sooner or later." Su Yang laughed out loud.

"I can hear you, Su Yang!" Qiuyue’s voice resounded from inside the building a second later.

Hearing her voice, Su Yang only laughed even louder.

"What’s so funny, darling?"

A calm voice suddenly resounded, and another figure appeared before them.

The three ladies turned to look at this young lady who appeared to be around the same age as Su Yang, yet there was this otherworldly aura surrounding her that made her seem much more mature and mysterious, and it felt rather similar to Su Yang’s aura.

"Lingxi." Su Yang looked at her.

"Hm?" However, right as she was prepared to speak, Tang Lingxi suddenly noticed the unique aura emitting from the three ladies, and then she saw the two cute babies in their arms.

"..."

Tang Lingxi immediately stopped her movements to stare at them with a gawking expression on her face, or more precisely, she was staring at the babies.

After a long moment of silence, she turned to look at Su Yang in a stiff movement.

"I-I don’t want to believe this but... Are those two little creatures... Do they, by any chance, belong to you?" she asked him in a dumbfounded voice while pointing at them with trembling fingers.

"That’s right. Do you like them? These little creatures?" he responded with a smile on his face.

"..."

However, Tang Lingxi did not immediately respond to him and instead turned to look at the babies again. She then approached Zhu Mengyi and Wu Jingjing, who quickly became nervous due to the profound aura surrounding Tang Lingxi.

Tang Lingxi stopped a moment later in front of Wu Jingjing, and she spoke, "Do you think I can hold onto her for a second?"

"Uhh..."

Wu Jingjing’s eyes immediately shifted to Su Yang, who nodded his head with a smile on his face.

Seeing this, all of the doubt in her heart disappeared, and Wu Jingjing handed Wu Min to Tang Lingxi.

And to her surprise, Wu Min didn’t cry despite being held by a stranger, as this was a first besides Su Yang.

"Haha... Look at this, darling. I am actually carrying your child— I didn’t think this would happen even in ten thousand years!" Tang Lingxi laughed with a beautiful smile on her face while making an expression that even Su Yang hasn’t seen before.

"I didn’t know you liked children that much. In fact, I thought you hated them," Su Yang said to her a moment later.

"You are right, I despise children. However, since they are your children, this is an entirely different story," Tang Lingxi chuckled.

"Actually, I can say the same to you, darling. I didn’t know you wanted children. I’m pretty sure I have heard you say something like ’I will never have children’ before," Tang Lingxi said.

Su Yang chuckled at her words for a moment before speaking, "Yes, I did say something like that in the past, but you seem to have recalled only half of that sentence, and I actually said ’I will never have children in this life’."

Sometime later, Tang Lingxi handed Wu Min back to her mother Wu Jingjing.

And then she said, "I know this is a little bit late, but my name is Tang Lingxi. However, the ’me’ you are seeing now is not the real ’me’, as I am only borrowing this young lady’s body using a forbidden pill."

"Huh?" The three ladies looked at Tang Lingxi with wide eyes, clearly shocked and speechless about her sudden revelation.
