Chapter 764 - A Great Harvest!

"Master!" Xiao Rong jumped to her feet from the bed the instant Su Yang returned to the Yin Yang Pavilion and entered his room.

"Did you wait for me this entire time?" Su Yang asked her with raised eyebrows. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

"Un." Xiao Rong nodded with an innocent face.

"You..." Su Yang was speechless. Did she want to do ’that’ that much?

"Master, I have retrieved the ingredients from Lian Li’s parents," Xiao Rong said as she handed him the storage ring they’d given her.

"Oh, thank you very much." Su Yang accepted the storage ring before putting it inside his robes.

"Lian Li’s parents also told me to ask Master if they can see the baby once it’s born," Xiao Rong added a moment later.

"I see," Su Yang nodded and said, "I’ll be going to the Holy Central Continent again so I’ll let them know myself later. Anyways, I need another favor from you."

"..."

Xiao Rong looked at him with a calm expression on her beautiful face, yet there was a subtle emotion within her gaze.

When Su Yang saw this, he smiled and said, "Don’t worry, I’ll give you your reward in a bit. I just want to know where the Northern and Western Continent is located."

"The Northern and Western Continent?" Xiao Rong tilted her head in a puzzled manner.

Su Yang then explained, "The land we’re standing on right now is called the Eastern Continent while the place Lian Li and the other two came from is called the Holy Central Continent. As for Qin Lianyu, she came from the Southern Continent, and I want to know where the other two places are located since there should be five continents in this world."

"You have traveled and seen for yourself every land in this world, right? Then you must know about the Western and Northern Continent, as there’s no way you would’ve missed such a large place."

After pondering for a moment, Xiao Rong nodded and said, "Yes, there are two other places besides the Eastern, Southern, and the Holy Central Continent."

"Good, because I will need your directions to those places later," Su Yang said to her.

Xiao Rong nodded her head.

"Anyway, since you have completed my request, I’ll reward you now. Take off your clothes and go lay on the bed," Su Yang said to her a moment later.

"Yes, Master!" Xiao Rong quickly removed her clothes in a childish manner before folding them and putting them on the table in a neat and elegant manner, dumbfounding Su Yang.

A few moments later, Xiao Rong sat on the bed with her petite body completely n.a.k.e.d and anticipation in her gaze as she patiently waited for Su Yang.

Su Yang approached the bed, and he laid Xiao Rong on the bed.

He then used his hands to gently caress Xiao Rong all over her petite body for a few minutes before he used his fingers to gently pinch and rub the pink n.i.p.p.l.es on her small b.r.e.a.s.ts.

"Mmm..."

Xiao Rong laid still on the bed with her limbs spread while releasing a low m.o.a.n as she familiarized herself with the sensation of pleasure tickling her body as it’d been a while since she last experienced such a feeling.

After teasing Xiao Rong’s small b.r.e.a.s.ts for a couple more minutes, Su Yang moved his hands lower on her body until he reached the small and closed slit between her slender legs.

"Aaah..."

Xiao Rong’s m.o.a.ning grew louder once Su Yang began touching her little sister, and her cave began flowing with Yin Qi a few moments later.

"Hmmm... Although I cannot cultivate your Yin Qi, I cannot watch it go to waste..."

Su Yang then retrieved a glass vial and placed it directly below Xiao Rong’s slit to collect her Yin Qi.

’Although the Yin Qi will degrade in quality over time, if I preserve it like medicine or pills, I can prevent it to a certain extent and save it for later when I can actually cultivate it.’ Su Yang thought to himself.

While preserved Yang Qi or Yin Qi cannot last as long as preserved medicine or pills, it would last long enough for Su Yang to use it in the future.

Meanwhile, Xiao Rong had no idea what Su Yang was doing or why he was collecting her ’liquid’, but she didn’t care what he was doing as long as he continued to please her body.

The glass of vial filled up very quickly with Xiao Rong’s Yin Qi, and once it was almost completely filled, Su Yang sealed it with a talisman before taking out another vial to continue collecting even more of Xiao Rong’s Yin Qi.

A few hours later, Su Yang managed to fill 10 bottles of Yin Qi from Xiao Rong— or more precisely, Xiao Rong had released enough Yin Qi to fill ten whole bottles!

And while the bottles had barely enough space to fit two fingers inside, it was still a lot of Yin Qi.

"Okay, I’ll end this here today," Su Yang said to Xiao Rong as he sealed the tenth bottle of Yin Qi.

Xiao Rong nodded, but her body was too sensitive to move, so she continued to lay on his bed even after it ended.

Meanwhile, Su Yang looked at the bottles of Yin Qi with a satisfied look on his face.

’What a great harvest. With this much Yin Qi, if I can somehow cultivate it, I would definitely enter the Sovereign Spirit Realm with ease and probably even the Divine Spirit Realm!’ Su Yang thought to himself.

But alas, in order to cultivate Xiao Rong’s Yin Qi, he’d need to improve his cultivation a lot more, and by the time he can cultivate Xiao Rong’s Yin Qi, it wouldn’t be as effective, but that’s not to say it wouldn’t benefit his cultivation at all. In fact, he can probably still gain a few levels if he continues to collect Xiao Rong’s Yin Qi!
