Chapter 1016: Event

Three days have passed since Su Yang decided to spend all of his time with Xing Aiying until her time with him is up.

During this time, Mei Xing would spend most of her time cultivating while Mei Ying would spend her time cleaning the house even if there was nothing to clean.

After cleaning, Mei Ying would try to cultivate Su Yang’s Yang Qi. Unfortunately, she had pretty much no talent in cultivation even though she has vast experience as an escort.

However, she did not give up and continued trying.

"Knock Knock*

Mei Ying heard the door being knocked on during her morning cleaning routine.

"Hello. How can we help you?" Mei Ying greeted the three figures standing outside their residence.

"Wow, what a pretty lady. Are you Disciple Xiao’s dual cultivation partner?" Li Sang’s eyes flickered with excitement after seeing Mei Ying.

Although she was a mortal and there are plenty of beautiful women in the Boundless Yin Yang Sect, Mei Ying would not lose to even some of the high quality disciples within the sect.

"Look at her cultivation, you idiot. She’s a mortal, so she’s probably his servant or something like that." Wu Bing said.

"You’re right. I am currently working for him." Mei Ying confirmed.

"Oh? What kind of work do you do?" Ji Ning asked. "I used to work for his massage parlor in the City of Pleasure, but he had to close it down in order to join this sect, and I decided to follow him. That’s all. I’m

more of a maid now than anything."

"A massage parlor? Him?"

The Outcast Triplets turned to look at each other with amazed looks on their faces.

"Anyways, we’re here to Disciple Xiao. Is he home?"

Wu Bing asked a moment later.

"He’s a little busy right now, but I can pass him your message."

"Alright. Tell him that there’s going to be an event for single disciples like us in two days and that we’d like to go there with him."

"If he somehow already got a partner, then you can ignore it and act like we never visited. That’s all."

"I understand. I will pass your message to him." Once Mei Ying went back inside the house, the Outcast Triplets mumbled to each other.

"Disciple Xiao owned a massage parlor? He doesn’t look like someone who would own such a place."

"Does this mean that pretty lady just now is an escort?"

"Do you think she’s still accepting clients? I wouldn’t mind losing my Pure Yang Essence to someone like her."

"Fuck, you want to give your Pure Yang Essence to an escort? Your master will kill you if she finds out!"

"Relax, I was only joking... Somewhat."

"Forget it. Let’s go back and prepare for the event. We have a real chance to find a partner this time, so we cannot fuck this up..." Wu Bing said.

Meanwhile, Mei Ying returned to cleaning the house. Since it wasn’t anything urgent, she decided to not bother Su Yang until he was free.

Towards the end of the day, Su Yang left Xing Aiying’s room for a break from their cultivation to check up on Mei Ying and Mei Xing.

"Manager, three disciples visited you this morning." Mei Ying said to him.

"Three disciples? I can only think of those three weirdos. What did they want?" Su Yang asked.

"They said there was an event for single disciples in two days, and they want you to go with them."

"An event for single disciples? What kind of event...

Oh."

It took Su Yang a moment before he recalled a certain event for single disciples that are having trouble finding partners, and this event would only

start one year after the disciple examination.

"Will you be participating in this event?" Mei Ying asked him out of curiosity.

"Why not." He nodded.

’I never got the chance to experience this event before since I never had trouble finding partners.

Now that I am back as a nobody, I should take this chance to experience all of the things that I never had the opportunity to experience before.’ Su Yang thought to himself.

"By the way, how’s your progress?" Su Yang suddenly asked Mei Ying about her cultivation.

She shook her head with a bitter smile, "I’m sorry. there hasn’t been any progress. Perhaps I am really but not fit for this kind of stuff and am fated to remain as a mortal forever."

"Hmmm..."

Su Yang began pondering.

"Alright, I will do something about it." He said a moment later.

"Huh? What are you going to do?"

Su Yang smiled and said, "If you do not have enough talent to cultivate, I can simply improve your innate talent."

"Y-You can do something like that?" Mei Ying’s eyes were as wide as saucers right now. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

"Of course. As long as I have the appropriate treasures, anything is possible."

"You really don’t have to go this far for me, Manager... If I am not making any progress, I can simply work harder until I am," she said.

Even a mortal like her knows that treasures that can increase one’s innate talent are very valuable and expensive, and she felt that using such a valuable treasure on someone like her would be a waste.

Su Yang smiled and said, "If you work any harder than you already are, I’m afraid that you’ll becomeb sick again."

"Don’t think too much about it. Just think of it as medicine."

"I-If you say so..." Mei Ying nodded.

"Wait for me. I will be back with your medicine son"

Su Yang went to let Xing Aiying know that he will be extending their break before leaving the house and walking to the Treasure Exchange Gallery, where disciples can go to exchange things for treasures.

Sometime later, he arrived at this tall building that was luxuriously decorated with jade and gold, and at the very top of the building was a Yin Yang symbol made of two people- a man and a female in the 69 position.
