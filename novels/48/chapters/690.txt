Chapter 691 Decades of Sexual Frustration

"Mmm~"

"Aaaa~"

"Oooh~"

Feng Xindou moaned softly as Su Yang gently caressed the area around and outside her cave entrance. Since her body was still fragile, Su Yang didn’t dare to touch her too intensively.

Once Feng Xindou was familiarized and comfortable with the feeling of his hands, Su Yang suddenly slipped one of his fingers into her cave whilst rubbing the pink pearl at the same time.

"Aaaahn!"

Feng Xindou’s body trembled at the sudden invasion, and her body released a flow of Yin Qi. Then with his other hand, Su Yang began massaging her perfectly shaped breasts that were neither too firm nor too soft and fitted into his grasp flawlessly.

"This... This feels amazing, Su Yang! Are you really just a doctor?" Feng Xindou asked him as her body overflowed with passion and satisfaction.

"Being a doctor is only a hobby and I only become one when it’s necessary. I’m actually a Dual Cultivator," he said to her.

"A Dual Cultivator? No wonder why you have such amazing hands and techniques! Your partners must be filled with bliss then!"

"It’s my responsibility as a man and their partner to do so, after all," Su Yang said with a smile on his handsome face.

After massaging Feng Xindou for many minutes, she suddenly grabbed his hands and spoke while staring at him with a lustful gaze, "Do you think you can... stick your thing inside me?"

"You want me to stick me what inside what?" Su Yang said with a smile.

"Ahn~! You dare to tease me, the Empress?" Feng Xindou spoke in a playful voice, and she continued a moment later, "I want your dick inside my lonely vagina, Su Yang."

Su Yang nodded and he said, "Don’t worry, you’ll get it later. Your body still needs some more time to get accustomed to the sensation."

Although she was a little saddened that she had to wait, Feng Xindou understood his intentions, and she nodded her head and allowed him to continue pleasing her body with his hands.

A few hours later, once Feng Xindou was getting impatient again, she asked Su Yang, "What about now, Su Yang? I think my body is ready to take any challenge from you."

"Let me check your body’s condition..." Su Yang suddenly increased the intensity of his techniques, sending Feng Xindou’s body into a state of extreme ecstasy.

"Aaaaaah~!"

"Aaaah~!"

Aaaaaaahn~!"

Feng Xindou moaned loudly for the next few minutes, feeling as though her entire body was on fire.

A few more minutes later, Su Yang suddenly stopped and removed his soaked hands from her bottom lips and nodded, "Okay, you’re ready."

He then stood up and loosened his robes.

"Oh my..." Feng Xindou covered her mouth from shock when she saw just how massive his rod was, exceeding all of her expectations.

"What a majestic and domineering weapon you have there, Su Yang..." she said to him.

Su Yang merely smiled at her words as he kneeled between her legs with his ruler pointing at Feng Xindou’s entrance that was leaking Yin Qi as it waited in anticipation.

After rubbing his shaft on her swollen pink pearl for a few more moments, Su Yang finally inserted his weapon into the Empress’s body, invading her hole and spreading her inner walls that hadn’t been touched for decades.

"Heavens!" Feng Xindou tightly held onto the bedsheets as she endured the feeling of Su Yang’s thick rod slowly going deeper into her body until it reached the very end of the cave.

"I-If I had to endure so many years of suffering just so I can experience this... I think it was very worth it..." Feng Xindou mumbled in a low voice after Su Yang’s entire shaft was inside her body.

"How do you feel?" Su Yang asked her a moment later.

"It feels like this is my first time all over again..." she said with a smile on her face.

"Then I’ll begin moving now."

"Yes, go ahead..."

"Mmm!"

Feng Xindou moaned with her mouth closed, feeling an indescribable sensation flowing through her body.

"Aaaah~!"

"Aaah~!"

After a few minutes of thrusting, Feng Xindou could already feel her body growing stronger and more energetic.

"W-What kind of miracle is this? It feels like I am gaining more energy as we continue doing this!" she exclaimed.

"My Yang Qi is a bit special, and it’ll help suppress your condition," he said to her.

"I don’t care what’s happening! I just want more!" Feng Xindou suddenly sat up and began riding Su Yang’s shaft on her own.

Su Yang then grabbed onto her round buttocks and assisted her movements, pounding her vigorously.

"Aahhh~!"

"Aaaaaah~!"

"Aahhhhhh!"

Feng Xindou’s hole continuously flowed with Yin Qi they cultivated, and within an hour of cultivation, her body had already almost fully recovered.

"More... more... Ahhhh~!"

As many decades of sexual frustration were finally being satisfied, Feng Xindou continued to cultivate with Su Yang for many hours on end, not even taking breaks. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

And coupled with her cultivation base at the seventh level Sovereign Spirit Realm, Feng Xindou was barely able to handle Su Yang’s profound techniques.

"I’m going to release some more Yang Qi into you," Su Yang suddenly said.

"Release all you want into me, Su Yang! Even if I get pregnant, I won’t complain!" Feng Xindou said with a lustful expression on her face.

A moment later, hot Yang Qi flowed into her body, yet they did not stop cultivating.

Their cultivation session lasted for many hours until the end of the day, and by the end, Feng Xindou laid on the bed with a sweaty body and her cave filled with Su Yang’s Yang Qi.

"Thank you... Su Yang... for not only saving me from that terrifying condition but also satisfying my sexual frustration that had built up for many decades..." Feng Xindou said to him in a gentle voice. "If there’s anything I can do for you as the Empress, don’t hesitate to ask me."
