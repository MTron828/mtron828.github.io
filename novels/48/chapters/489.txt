Chapter 490 Confronting the Sun Family

"What?! My fiancee was seen kissing that man the Sun Family claims to be a distant cousin?! Impossible!" Mu Shun slammed his fist on the table, breaking the fourth table from anger this week.

"It’s true, Young Master! As commanded, we have followed them every second they were on the streets, and we witnessed them kissing inside the Jade Rabbit Restaurant!"

"The Jade Rabbit Restaurant, huh?! Take me there!" Mu Shun suddenly stood up and said, "I have been ignoring this farce for far too long! I am going to see my fiancee and this distant cousin of hers!"

"I have also had enough of this." Mu Lan, his father, also stood up and said, "Then I shall personally visit the Sun Family."

Sometime later, Mu Lan arrived at the Sun Family’s household with an attitude that made it seem as though his parents were just murdered.

"Get your ass out here, Sun Family!" Mu Lan roared at the top of his lungs, startling the people within the Sun Family that were minding their own business.

A few moments later, Sun Ren and Sun Quan appeared before Mu Lan with a frown on their faces, clearly unhappy about Mu Lan’s rudeness.

"Even if you are the head of the Mu Family, the Sun Family is not a place where you can act as you please, Patriarch Mu." Sun Quan said to him.

"Why did you even come here? If you are here to talk about my daughter being too intimate with her cousin, then I have nothing left to say." Sun Ren sighed.

"Sun Family! My Mu family must look like fools in your eyes right about now, huh?!" Mu Lan’s face fumed, his forehead popping with veins.

The Sun couple exchanged puzzled glances with each other before speaking, "What are you talking about?"

"Don’t play dumb! That man with the mask simply cannot just be a cousin! After all, we have caught them red-handed kissing each other in public!" Mu Lan revealed to them the reason he was there.

"W-What?!" Sun Ren’s eyes widened with shock, as she couldn’t believe what she’d just heard.

’They kissed in public? Why would they do something that scandalous in public? They cannot be that stupid!’ Sun Ren pondered inwardly.

"What proof do you have that they kissed in public?" Sun Quan suddenly asked.

"Oh? You don’t know? My Mu Family has been tailing them for the past week, silently watching their every movement! And just some time ago, we caught them kissing at the Jade Rabbit Restaurant!"

The frown on Sun Ren’s face deepened. ’There’s no way that mere lackeys from the Mu Family could tail someone at the Heavenly Spirit Realm without being noticed! This is clearly a trap! However, I still can’t tell if it’s a trap for the Mu Family or for us!’

"You know what? You can continue to play dumb! However, my Mu Family will no longer sit around and take this humiliation! My son, Mu Shun, should’ve confronted them by now! Once he confirms their scandalous act, he will kill that masked man no matter his background!" Mu Lan laughed loudly.

"What?!"

The Sun couple exclaimed with a shocked face.

"A-Are you trying to kill your own son?" Sun Quan looked at Mu Lan with a pitying face.

"What do you mean by that?" Mu Lan instantly frowned upon feeling the ominous feeling in the air.

"Since it has already come to this point, there’s no point in hiding his identity now." Sun Ren shook her head.

"That masked man... his real identity is Su Yang." Sun Ren finally revealed his identity to Mu Lan.

"S-Su Yang...?" Mu Lan stood there with a dazed expression. He did not immediately recognize this name, but after pondering for a few seconds, his eyes widened from shock after realization. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

"Oh no! Do not do anything rash, my son!" Mu Lan immediately turned around and rushed out of the Sun Family with his body soaked with cold sweat.

"Should we follow him?" Sun Quan mumbled.

"Of course." Sun Ren nodded.

It was obvious where Mu Lan was headed, so they proceeded to follow him.

Meanwhile, at the Jade Rabbit Restaurant, one of the most successful luxury restaurants in the city, Su Yang and Sun Jingjing were casually eating spiritual meat as though it were common food.

Suddenly, in the midst of their lunch, a commotion erupted near the entrance of the restaurant.

"Young Master Mu?! What are you doing— Ah!"

Mu Shun stomped into the restaurant like an angry elephant a few seconds later, even kicking the waitress out of the way.

The people inside the restaurant stopped eating to watch the scene, as they were all aware of why the Young Master of the Mu Family would appear in this place and with such a heated temper.

"Uh oh, Young Master Mu is finally here." One of the patrons there mumbled.

"He must have heard of what happened already..."

"Took him long enough."

While the patrons mumbled to each other, Mu Shun scanned the restaurant with his narrowed eyes until he noticed the beautiful lady sitting near the back of the restaurant.

At first glance, he was dazed by Sun Jingjing’s beauty, but when he remembered why he’d gone there, he stomped towards them with his round stomach jiggling along the way.

"Sun Jingjing, what is the meaning of this?! Just who the hell is this man?!"

When Mu Shun finally arrived at their table, Sun Jingjing and Su Yang stopped eating to look at the short yet round figure standing before them.

However, when Sun Jingjing did not respond to his question, Mu Shun continued to speak, "I am asking you a question, Sun Jingjing! Don’t think I am not aware that you’d kissed this man some time ago in this restaurant! You are supposed to be my woman, and we are even engaged! If you don’t want me to kill him, I demand answers!"

"I can ask you the same question," Su Yang suddenly said as he elegantly wiped his lips with a piece of cloth. "Which imbecile let his pig out of the cage? It’s ruining my appetite."
