Chapter 481 City of Yuan

"Master? What nonsense are you spewing?" Qiuyue approached her with a puzzled frown on her ethereal face.

"Y-You’re not his Master? Then who are you, really? What’s your relationship with Su Yang?" Sun Jingjing asked her in a low voice, clearly dazed by her beauty.

"I can ask you the same thing. Who are you?" Qiuyue stared at Sun Jingjing in the eyes, causing the atmosphere there to quickly turn cold, almost as though a war is starting.

"..."

Sensing the invisible and cold atmosphere between them, Qin Liangyu unconsciously took a few steps back into the house.

After a few moments of silence, Qiuyue’s gaze lowered from Sun Jingjing’s face to her stomach.

And in one swift movement, she partially removed Sun Jingjing’s robes, revealing the skin on her stomach.

"Oh...?" Qiuyue’s eyebrows trembled slightly when she saw the family seal on Sun Jingjing’s skin.

"H-Hey! What do you think you are doing?!" Sun Jingjing jumped away from surprise, looking at Qiuyue as though she was a pervert, before she quickly covered herself again.

"Family Seal, huh. And it’s Su Yang’s Family Seal." Qiuyue mumbled to herself as she finally understood the situation.

"So you are now a part of Su Yang’s family, right?" Qiuyue said to her.

Sun Jingjing stared at Qiuyue with a dazed face for a moment before speaking in a low and suspicious, "Are you also...?"

"What are the two of you doing?"

Su Yang’s voice suddenly resounded, breaking their cold atmosphere instantly.

"Su Yang!"

Sun Jingjing and Qiuyue called him simultaneously.

"G-Get this, Su Yang! This... this beautiful pervert here just stripped me out of the blue!" Sun Jingjing complained to him after he descended from the sky with Xiao Rong by his side.

Su Yang raised an eyebrow and looked at Qiuyue with a questioning gaze.

"I just wanted to confirm something that I sensed from her body, that’s all." Qiuyue casually shrugged.

"If you’re wondering, yes, I have given her my family seal." Su Yang said with a smile.

"And when do you plan on telling me this?" Qiuyue asked with a slight frown, clearly displeased with the situation.

"Soon." Su Yang quickly responded. "You were away when I gave her the Family Seal, after all."

"..."

Qiuyue remained speechless, as did her unhappy expression.

Seeing this, Su Yang merely approached her with a gentle smile and whispered in her ears, "Don’t worry, once we get rid of your curse, I can also imprint my name on you."

"?!?!"

Qiuyue’s face quickly blew up with redness after hearing his words.

"W-Whatever!" she exclaimed before rushing into her room and closing the door.

"Who was that?" Sun Jingjing asked him a few moments later.

"I will properly introduce her to you later, but you seem to have some business with me."

"Oh, right! I nearly forgot because of her!" Sun Jingjing said, "Su Yang, do you remember what my parents said to us during their visit? This is about the Mu Family that has been bothering my family. Apparently they have been getting increasingly aggressive with the negotiations regarding my engagement with them."

"Is that so...?" Su Yang mumbled with a calm expression.

"My parents also wanted the both of us to visit them... at our family house."

"There’s about three weeks before the examinations start." Su Yang said, "I suppose I can spare some time to take this little trip with you to see your family."

"Great! Then when will we leave?"

"We can leave now." He spoke as he retrieved the flying boat.

"We should be back in a few days," he then said to Qin Liangyu.

A few moments later, Su Yang and Sun Jingjing ascended towards the clouds in the flying boat.

"Where are we going?" he asked her.

"City of Yuan, the largest business market in the Eastern Continent. The Sun Family’s main branch is also located there, as most of our business is also within that city."

"By the way..." Sun Jingjing turned to look at the beautiful girl floating behind them with a perplexed expression. "Who’s that little girl...? And why does she resemble that woman in your house?"

"My name is Xiao Rong, and I am Master’s Spiritual Beast." Xiao Rong introduced herself.

"Spiritual Beast...? Then you are not human?" Sun Jingjing’s eyes widened, since Xiao Rong looked human in every aspect.

A few seconds after she said those words, a pair of cat ears appeared on top of Xiao Rong’s head.

"Xiao Rong is a Phantom Cat."

"I-I see... My name is Sun Jingjing, and I am Su Yang’s partner." Sun Jingjing introduced herself.

"Partner...?" Xiao Rong tilted her head in a puzzled manner, clearly not understanding the word.

Sometime later, the flying boat soared through the sky, splitting the cloud it touches into halves.

"We are here, Su Yang."

Although only a few moments have passed, the flying boat traveled thousands of miles within those few moments.

"Even though this is not the first time I have been on this treasure, its speed is always astonishing to experience." Sun Jingjing smiled. "However... what’s even more shocking is..."

She turned to look at Xiao Rong, who managed to follow their ridiculous speed without the help of any treasure and with seemingly no effort.

"Xiao Rong, can you transform into your beast form? Your appearance will attract too much attention here." Su Yang said to her.

Xiao Rong nodded, and a few moments later, her human figure transformed into that of an ordinary white cat.

"Wow�� she’s really not human..." Sun Jingjing mumbled, as this is her first time witnessing the scene of a human transforming into an animal.

Sometime later, their group descended to the ground a few miles away from the city.

"Let’s go, Su Yang, to my home." Sun Jingjing said with a bright smile on her face as she grabbed his hands and began dragging him towards the city gates.

"If you pull that hard, my arms will be ripped right off." Su Yang chuckled.
