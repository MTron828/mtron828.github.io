"Mmm..."

"Mmmmm~"

"Aaahn..."

Lian Li m.o.a.ned softly as Su Yang gently and slowly thrust his rod inside her cave so that she could get used to the new feeling.

Once Lian Li was comfortable with the new sensation, Su Yang began moving his h.i.p.s faster and faster.

"You’re drooling more than usual," Su Yang said to her after noticing an excessive amount of Yin Qi flowing from her cave just a few minutes later.

Of course, this was natural, as pregnancy helped Lian Li’s inner walls soften and discharge more fluid than usual, allowing her to not only feel more pleasure than normal despite Su Yang barely doing anything but also release more Yin Qi.

"More... more... Su Yang... go deeper!" Lian Li pleaded with a l.u.s.tful look on her face.

Su Yang nodded, and he pushed his rod deeper into her cave until it reached the end.

"Ooooh~!" Lian Li released a loud and satisfying m.o.a.n when she felt her belly become even fuller, almost like it was bloating up.

A few minutes later, Lian Li’s b.r.e.a.s.ts began leaking b.r.e.a.s.t milk.

When Su Yang saw this, he pulled her body off the bed and made her sit on his lap while he sucked on her b.r.e.a.s.ts.

"Mmmm~"

Lian Li’s hands hugged Su Yang’s head and mumbled, "Do you like it, Su Yang?"

After sucking a few mouthfuls of her b.r.e.a.s.t milk, Su Yang said with a smile on his face, "It’s incredibly fresh and sweet— I like it."

The two of them continued to cultivate with each other for another hour or so until Lian Li could no longer endure it. Since Lian Li’s sensitivity increased, her stamina consumption also increased, making it difficult for her to have long sessions with Su Yang.

However, even though it was only for an hour, Lian Li felt more satisfied than she would in ten hours.

"Are you okay?" Su Yang asked her afterward.

"Yes... I am perfectly fine..." Lian Li responded in a slightly panting voice.

"Thank you... Su Yang..." she added a moment later.

"There’s no need to thank me. I won’t ignore you just because you are pregnant," he chuckled.

"Anyway, you should get some rest. I am going to check on Liqing before going to the Xie Family," Su Yang then said.

"Un. I see you later," Lian Li said to him before quickly falling asleep on his bed.

After leaving the Yin Yang Pavilion, Su Yang went to the Medicine Hall to check on Su Liqing.

"Welcome, Su Yang." Su Liqing said to him as she sat on her bed while reading a book.

"Liqing, how’s your body?" Su Yang asked her the moment he saw her, and he continued, "Any changes?"

Hearing his words, a bitter smile appeared on Su Liqing’s face, and she removed the blanket covering her, revealing to him her flawless figure.

"Unfortunately, there’s still no change. Perhaps I am really infertile and unable to get pregnant..." Su Liqing sighed.

Even though her stomach is supposed to be bloating like Lian Li, there were no changes to her body even many months after Su Yang supposedly i.m.p.r.e.g.n.a.t.ed her.

"Hmm... I should’ve done this before, but I wanted to believe that you were pregnant so I purposefully ignored it. Give me your hands, I’ll check your body," Su Yang said to her.

Su Liqing nodded and extended her fair hands for him.

Su Yang proceeded to check her pulses and used his spiritual energy to probe deeper into her body.

A few minutes later, Su Yang opened his mouth and said, "Looks like you are really not pregnant. However, there shouldn’t be any problem with my Yang Qi, as I’d only released fertile Yang Qi into your body for the past couple of months, so there must be a problem with your reproductive system."

"So it’s really my problem..." Su Liqing sighed.

Seeing her dejected face, Su Yang gently pinched her soft cheeks and said with a smile on his face, "Don’t worry about it. I have treated hundreds of women who had problems with pregnancy issues— I’ll find a cure for you as soon as possible."

"Thank you, Su Yang." Su Liqing said.

"There’s no need to be impatient. We’ll have plenty of time to make a baby in this life," Su Yang said.

And he continued, "Do you want to cultivate today? If not, I’ll head to the Xie Family and start preparing for the cure."

"I’ll cultivate," Su Liqing nodded.

A few moments later, Su Yang entered the bed, and they began cultivating with each other. Of course, Su Yang released his fertile Yang Qi into her stomach regardless if Su Liqing can become pregnant or not from it.

After their cultivation, Su Yang left the Medicine Hall and retrieved the flying ship. However, he did not immediately fly to the Xie Family and instead called for Xiao Rong.

"Xiao Rong! Come over here for a moment!" Su Yang said out loud.

A few seconds later, Xiao Rong appeared before him like a ghost.

"Can you do me a favor and go on a small errand for me?" Su Yang said to her, and he continued, "Go to the Holy Central Continent and find Lian Li’s parents. Let them know Su Yang had sent you to pick up a few herbs. Oh, you can also tell them about what happened to Patriarch Gold."

"In return for your efforts, I’ll do ’that’ to you again," Su Yang said to her with a smile.

Xiao Rong’s eyes flickered with excitement after hearing his words, as she hasn’t felt Su Yang’s touch since 3 months ago.

She quickly nodded before disappearing from Su Yang’s sight and flew towards the Holy Central Continent at record-breaking speed.

Meanwhile, Su Yang jumped onto the flying ship and soared towards the Xie Family in Snowfall City.

"..."

Xiao Rong arrived at the Holy Central Continent in less than a minute, and she hovered in the air with her small nose moving slightly.

Once she’d picked up a scent that smells similar to Lian Li’s scent, Xiao Rong flew towards that location faster than a shooting star, arriving at Emperor Lian’s household two seconds later.
