Chapter 811 - Expelling the Poison

After massaging Lu Youyi’s tender body for half an hour, Su Yang used a needle that was coated in medicine and poked a hole in her body, where all of the poison he’d pushed from the massage gathered.

After poking a hole on her thighs, Su Yang approached the hole with his mouth, and he began sucking the poison from her body.

"Aaaah~!" Lu Youyi released a soft m.o.a.n upon feeling Su Yang’s sucking sensation on her thighs, and the slit between her legs began leaking with even more Yin Qi.

Lu Youyi’s face flushed with redness when she noticed how Su Yang’s face was so close to her maiden cave.

’W-What if it smells weird? Ahhh! I feel like dying!’ she cried inwardly.

A few moments later, after what felt like an eternity for Lu Youyi, Su Yang finally removed his lips from her thighs, and he swallowed the poison he’d sucked from her body afterward.

Lu Youyi had a scare after seeing this, and she quickly exclaimed, "W-Why did you swallow the poison?!"

"Calm down," Su Yang said to her in a calm voice, and he continued, "Poison at this level won’t harm me since I have a body that’s immune to most poisons. In fact, it’ll even benefit me."

"I-Is that so..." Lu Youyi mumbled, even sighing in relief after hearing his words.

"Anyway, I have expelled even more poison from your body. However, it’ll still require a few more days before I can expel all of the poison from your body since your body is still too fragile to handle all of it being expelled at once."

"I understand, Su Yang. Thank you for today." Lu Youyi said to him.

Su Yang nodded and left the room shortly later.

After Su Yang left, Lu Youyi continued to lay on the bed with a dazed look on her face, almost like she had a lot on her mind.

"Su Yang, huh..." she mumbled in a low voice with a gentle smile on her face, looking like a young maiden in love.

"How’s the girl doing?" Lian Li asked Su Yang after he returned to the room.

"There’s a lot more poison in her body than I’d expected. It’ll take a few more days before I can expel all of them."

The next day, Su Yang returned to Lu Youyi’s room for another treatment session.

After half an hour of massage, Su Yang repeated his process from yesterday and began sucking on Lu Youyi’s soft thighs.

Sometime later, Su Yang swallowed the poison, which boosted his cultivation base by a very small amount.

Compared to the first time he’d consumed the Three Seasons Snake’s poison, his cultivation was barely affected this time. However, that was to be expected, since his cultivation base right now is incomparable to when he was only a cultivator at the Elementary Spirit Realm.

"I’ll see you tomorrow. Don’t forget to take the medicine two more times today— once in the afternoon and once before you sleep," Su Yang said to her before leaving the room.

A few hours after Su Yang left, Lu Youyi’s parents knocked on her door.

"How are you feeling, Youyi?" Lu Jin, her mother, asked her.

"I am feeling better than ever before, mother. I’m sorry for making you worry. You too, father."

"Don’t even mention it. Just rest for now." Lu Duhan said.

The following day, Su Yang returned to her room for another treatment session.

"Tomorrow will be the last session. There’s barely any more poison in your body right now, and I will be able to extract the remaining poison tomorrow in one go," Su Yang said to her after the treatment.

"Okay. Thank you, Su Yang."

’Tomorrow will be the last day, huh?’ Lu Youyi sighed inwardly, immediately feeling a little bit more lonely just from thinking about it.

The next day, to the Lu Family’s surprise, the doctor that was supposed to treat Lu Youyi arrived earlier than expected.

"I rushed here as soon as I finished treating my other patient! Where’s the young lady?" The doctor arrived at the Lu Family with his body soaked in sweat.

However, Lu Duhan appeared before the doctor with an apologetic expression on his face, and he said, "I’m sorry, Doctor Sang. Even though we made you rush all the way over here, your presence is no longer required here, since my daughter has already been cured by another individual. However, we’ll still compensate you for your time as we’d promised."

"What? The young lady has been cured already? By whom?" Doctor Sang’s eyes widened with surprise after hearing this. As far as he was aware, there aren’t any doctors besides himself that can deal with the Three Seasons Snake’s poison.

"I’ll introduce you to him. Follow me." Lu Duhan proceeded to bring Doctor Sang to the guest room where Su Yang was staying in.

"Esteemed guest! Are you available right now? The doctor that was supposed to cure my daughter is here, and he would like to meet you!" Lu Duhan knocked on the door and said in a respectful voice from outside.

"..."

Doctor Sang was speechless already since this is his first time witnessing Lu Duhan acting in such a humble manner.

The door opened a few moments later, and Su Yang appeared before them with his clothes loosened, almost like he just got out of bed. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

He then glanced at the old man standing behind Lu Duhan and said, "Why do you want to see me?"

Doctor Sang quickly said, "Hello, I am Doctor Sang. I was supposed to heal the young lady, but I was told that someone else had already healed her, and I just wanted to see who else besides myself could possibly know so much about Three Seasons Snakes. After all, it would be bad if the young lady was treated wrongly..."

Su Yang raised his eyebrows and said in a somewhat scoffing voice, "Who else besides you? You must be very proud of yourself for knowing such basic knowledge. Do you want me to clap for you or something? And if you think I treated her wrongly, you can check for yourself."
