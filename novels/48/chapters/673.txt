Chapter 674 - Why Are You Stopping?

"Hmm... Since you are poisoned and technically not in the right state of mind, I don’t want to make it seem like I am trying to take advantage of you, but there is only one way to make the poison leave your body faster— and that is to discharge it out of your body through pleasure," Su Yang said to her.

"H-How is that any different from what I am doing now?! Are you making fun of me?!" Lian Li shouted at him.

"Of course not. The powders from Heavenly Gratification is a unique poison that affects one’s Yin or Yang Qi, and the only method to get rid of it is by discharging it through your Yin Qi," Su Yang said.

"Then how come it’s not affecting you?! Why can’t you just teach me whatever method you’re using to control the poison?!" she cried as her hands continued to pleasure herself without even thinking, almost like an irresistible itch.

"What I am doing requires years of effort and natural experience and is not something you can learn in a day or two, much less a few minutes. If you don’t want to listen to me, then I’ll just leave you alone and let you squirm around for the next few hours. However, if someone enters this room before you’re done..."

Lian Li’s face immediately paled after hearing his words. She would rather die than to let someone else see her in such a humiliating manner!

"Okay! You win! I will listen to you! But how do I discharge my Yin Qi faster?!" She said to him a moment later.

"Although you might not be able to do it because you are inexperienced, I am a different story, as I am a Dual Cultivator. If you let me touch you, I can help you discharge your Yin Qi much faster than you can ever achieve by yourself."

"You want me to touch me?! I knew you had ulterior intentions, you damn pervert!" Lian Li exclaimed with a terrified look on her face.

If Su Yang were to force himself on her right now, she doubts that she would be able to refuse his advances, much less resist him.

"Relax, I won’t touch you without your permission, and I definitely won’t do anything more than helping you release your Yin Qi. I didn’t mention this since there wasn’t a need to but I am also a doctor and an Alchemist, so I know what I’m doing. And if you let me treat you, the poison will fully disappear within ten minutes."

"Aaah~!" Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Lian Li suddenly m.o.a.ned loudly, as the burning sensation in her body suddenly flared up again.

"I-I don’t care anymore! Do whatever you want with my body! But if you go too far, I swear upon my family name that I will not forgive you!" Lian Li shouted at him before collapsing on the floor.

Su Yang nodded and said, "Then excuse me..."

Su Yang waved his sleeves, sending the empty plates on the table to a corner and cleaning the table while he was at it, before picking up Lian Li and placing her on the table.

"Ahhhh~!"

Lian Li’s little sister gushed with Yin Qi just from being picked up by Su Yang.

Once she was on the table, Su Yang began roaming through her clothes with his hands without removing her clothes.

"Aaaaah!" Lian Li m.o.a.ned loudly, feeling a heavenly sensation wherever Su Yang’s hands touched.

"Even though it’s already soaking wet, I’m going to take off your undergarment," Su Yang said to her as he removed the soaking wet underwear from her body, sliding it off her slim and long legs.

Once the stained cloth was removed, Su Yang was able to see the beautiful pink flower that was trembling between her legs.

Su Yang reached for the untainted flower, but he didn’t immediately touch it and caressed the area around her slit.

"Aaaaaaaahh~!"

Lian Li’s body shook violently from the teasing, and her flower gushed with Yin Qi before squirting it everywhere.

Once her climax has passed, Su Yang slowly slipped two of his fingers into the entrance of her cave with ease and began massaging her insides.

"Ooooh~!"

Lian Li tightly held onto the table by its side and climaxed again shortly later, and the table began dripping with her Yin Qi.

"More... more... aaaaaah~!"

Lian Li was so indulged in the pleasure that she’d forgotten about the poison, and ten minutes passed by in a flash without her realizing it.

"Why... Why are you stopping?" Lian Li looked at him with a dazed expression on her face when he suddenly stopped touching her, not realizing that her body had healed.

"Because the poison is already out of your body. Or do you want me to keep going despite that?" Su Yang asked her.

"Y-Yes!"

A smile then appeared on his face, and he said in a calm voice, "Then you should go home to recover your state of mind first. I won’t take advantage of someone in your condition. If you want me to continue, find me at Wu Jingjing’s living quarters. I can promise you that it’ll feel much better than what you’d experienced here— a hundred times more enjoyable."

"O-One hundred times...?" Lian Li stared at him with a dazed face and swallowed nervously, but she cannot imagine what that kind of pleasure might feel like.

After staring at him in silence for a few moments, Lian Li stood up and spoke with a cold expression on her face, "Remove the formation. I’m leaving."

Su Yang nodded and removed the formation. "What about this piece of cloth?" Su Yang asked her while pointing at the black triangular cloth sitting on the table.

Lian Li immediately ran to pick up her soaking wet underwear before flying out of the window, not daring to look at Su Yang’s face, fearing that she might not want to leave afterward.

Once Lian Li disappeared from his sight, Su Yang’s calm expression turned cold, and he mumbled in a low voice, "Now... How should I deal with this place?"
