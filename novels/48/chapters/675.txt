Chapter 676 - Extreme Humiliation

"P-Please! I beg you! Don’t do this to me! I will do anything you want!" Jiu Chun began begging Su Yang as he was being dragged away slowly, feeling as though he was being dragged to hell by the death god.

"The only thing I want from you is pure humiliation! Since you dared to try to humiliate me, I shall do the same to you! You should be thankful that I am going to let you keep your worthless life!" Su Yang spoke in a cold voice as he continued dragging Jiu Chun along with him.

And since they had a few minutes to spare before the poison took effect, Su Yang took his time going down the stairs, which only made Jiu Chun feel even more miserable.

Once they reached the eighth floor, Jiu Chun could feel the rod between his legs stiffen.

"Ahhhh! Stop! Stop it! Don’t! Don’t do this! You are not human!" Jiu Chun’s desperate crying immediately alerted the guests inside the rooms on the eighth floor even before Su Yang opened the door.

A few moments later, Su Yang opened one of the doors and lifted Jiu Chun’s body into the air before tearing the lower part of his clothes away, revealing his tiny dagger to the shocked guests.

The guests in the room covered their mouths from shock, but before they could even say a single word, Jiu Chun began ejaculating all over the place without being able to control it.

"Ahhhh!"

"Shit! What the f.u.c.k are you doing, Jiu Chun?!"

The guests were immediately enraged when Jiu Chun’s Yang Qi splattered all over their food.

"T-This is not me! I am being forced to do this! I swear!" Jiu Chun cried with tears in his eyes.

After staying in the room for less than half a minute, Su Yang left the room to go to another room, repeating the same thing he just did to the other room, and he would continue this until he went to every single room on every single floor in the restaurant.

Once there were no longer any more rooms to disturb, Su Yang went outside and began walking around the street with Jiu Chun still ejaculating nonstop, leaving a trail of white substance wherever he walked.

"Heavens! Is that Jiu Chun, the owner of Nine Spring Hall?!"

"W-What the hell is happening?! What is he doing?!"

The pedestrians were shocked, even traumatized by the scene.

After spending an hour walking around the streets, Su Yang returned to the Nine Spring Hall, where every customer had left whilst the servants were all gathered outside, seemingly waiting for Jiu Chun’s return.

By now, Jiu Chun had a blank expression on his face, seemingly dead inside.

Seeing this, Su Yang tossed Jiu Chun to the side of the street like trash.

A moment later, he retrieved his sword and faced the Nine Spring Hall.

"Regardless of the circ.u.mstances, a restaurant that dares to poison its customers... doesn’t deserve to exist!" Su Yang’s body suddenly emitted with powerful Sword Qi, and with a single swing from his sword, the entire nine-floor tall building was split in half. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

"Ah... Ahhh...!"

Jiu Chun immediately began crying again when he saw this, and his voice was filled with deep sorrow, almost as though he had just witnessed his wife and sons being executed before him.

"Anyone who dares to try and humiliate me, Su Yang, in such a manner, will receive no mercy!" Su Yang said out loud before flying away, quickly disappearing into the night sky.

"S-Su Yang...?" Jiu Chun stared at Su Yang’s disappearing figure with a dazed look on his face.

Wasn’t Su Yang also the name of Immortal Fairy Su Yue’s husband?! Did he really just offend Immortal Fairy Su Yue’s husband?!

Jiu Chun’s back was soaked in cold sweats at that thought, feeling even more terrified than before everything went down.

If he’d really offended Immortal Fairy Su Yue’s husband, losing his pride and dignity as a man is the last thing he should be worried about!

That night, news of what happened at the Nine Spring Hall and what Jiu Chun did was spread throughout the world like wildfire, reaching nearly every nook and cranny of the Holy Central Continent before the sun even rose.

Meanwhile, Wu Jingjing greeted Su Yang when he returned home.

"How was your dinner with Her Highness today?" she asked him.

"Chaotic and unexpected," he calmly responded.

"Oh? Care to tell me more about it? And how far do you think you’ve gotten with Her Highness tonight?"

"Well, you see..."

Su Yang proceeded to recall everything that had happened at the Nine Spring Hall to Wu Jingjing, who listened with wide eyes, which only grew larger as Su Yang went deeper into the story.

"I didn’t think Her Highness would do such a thing to you! I’m glad nothing happened to you, Su Yang!" Wu Jingjing quickly went into his embrace, and their body fell onto the bed.

"And that Jiu Chun! Even if it was Her Highness’s idea, he had the authority and means to refuse such a request! The fact he didn’t refuse meant that he really didn’t mind poisoning you just to curry some favor with Her Highness! He deserved everything that happened to him today!"

"And after hearing about what Her Highness did to you, I think it would be for the best if you stay away from her, as she clearly doesn’t deserve someone like you!" Wu Jingjign in a slightly angry voice.

"Haha... Thank you for getting angry in my stead, Jingjing. As a reward, I’ll pleasure you for the entire night. After all, even though I can control the poison, it’s not as though it’s completely out of my system, and I still have to discharge my Yang Qi sooner or later."

"Unfortunately, I don’t think I’ll be able to endure for the entire night," she sighed.

"Don’t worry, I will do it at a pace where even you can endure for the entire night without sacrificing too much pleasure in doing so," he said to her.

"Really?" Wu Jingjing’s eyes immediately began to flicker.

"Un." Su Yang nodded, and he said, "I’m ready when you are."
