Chapter 750 You“re Actually a Pretty Lustful Woman, Aren“t You?

After hearing Bai Lihua’s confession, Su Yang nodded with a handsome smile on his face, and he said, "Very well, Lihua. I shall make you my woman today."

He then kissed her on the lips again whilst loosening her robes at the same time.

"Mmm..."

Bai Lihua could feel Su Yang’s warm hands roaming inside her clothes and feeling the smooth skin on her body, yet she did not say anything and continued kissing him, allowing Su Yang to touch her as he pleased.

A few minutes later, Bai Lihua laid on the bed naked, revealing to Su Yang her large, luscious breasts and pretty little sister.

"You have a very beautiful body, and I can feel my heart beating faster after a single glance," Su Yang said with a handsome smile on his face as he teased the two pink and perky tips on Bai Lihua’s peaks with his fingers.

A few moments later, Su Yang kissed her soft breasts and began sucking on them while his hands reached for the wet lips between her legs.

"Ahhh~!" Bai Lihua unconsciously closed her legs when she felt Su Yang’s fingers brush against the edge of her slit.

"Relax." Su Yang said to her.

Bai Lihua nodded with a flushed face before she slowly opened her legs back up, allowing him full access to her untainted pink garden that has never been touched or seen by another man until today.

Su Yang immediately began touching her pink slit the moment it showed itself, rubbing his fingers in-between the split

"Mmmmh!" Bai Lihua’s body trembled when an indescribable sensation slithered all over her body, and her body immediately gushed with Yin Qi in an uncontrollable manner.

"Wow, I didn’t expect you to be that sensitive..." A mysterious smile appeared on Su Yang’s face after seeing that Bai Lihua had climaxed so quickly.

"W-Wait a second Su Yang, my body is..."

However, Su Yang continued to rub her slippery bottom lips, causing it to gush with even more Yin Qi.

"Aaaaah~!"

A lustful expression appeared on Bai Lihua’s face, looking like she was on the verge of going crazy.

"Look at how wet you are— you’re actually a pretty lustful woman, aren’t you, Lihua?" Su Yang gently pinched the pink pearl in her slit, overwhelming her body with pleasure. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

"Ahhhh! It’s coming out again!" Bai Lihua cried out loud as another wave of Yin Qi squirted from her cave.

"It hasn’t even been five minutes and you’ve already climaxed 7 times. Aren’t you a little too sensitive?" Su Yang chuckled afterward.

"Haaa... haaaa... haaa... How long are you going to tease my body, Su Yang?" Bai Lihua looked at him with teary eyes after experiencing too much pleasure.

"Are you already exhausted? The real fun hasn’t even begun yet," Su Yang then removed his clothes and tossed them into the air behind him.

Bai Lihua immediately turned silent after seeing Su Yang’s dragon, and she continued to stare at it with a dazed look on her face until Su Yang approached her.

However, Su Yang’s dragon was so stiff at this moment that it wouldn’t budge a millimeter even while he moved, which dumbfounded Bai Lihua even more.

’If he sticks that inside me, I’ll definitely become a different person afterward!’ Bai Lihua cried inwardly.

"W-Wait a second, Su Yang..." Bai Lihua suddenly said to him in a nervous voice.

However, Su Yang did not stop and suddenly grabbed her by the legs before pulling her body into him.

"Do you want to stop here?" Su Yang asked her after he pressed his whole sausage in-between her slit.

"You don’t want this?"

Bai Lihua swallowed nervously at the sight of the overbearing object that was pointing at her from between her legs, feeling as though it was charming her.

"I... I want it..." Bai Lihua mumbled in a dazed voice, and she no longer thought about anything else and only could only focus on the powerful beast that had managed to entice her.

"Are you sure you want it?" Su Yang asked her again.

"Yes! I want it, Su Yang! Please give it to me!" Bai Lihau exclaimed.

"Very well!"

Su Yang immediately moved his hips back before thrusting it forward, piercing Bai Lihua’s maiden cave with his sword, spreading her closed walls wide open.

"Ahhhh!" Bai Lihua nearly choked on her own saliva after feeling the intense pain that came from between her legs, feeling as though something had ripped inside her body.

"Are you okay?" Su Yang asked her afterward, as he could see her virgin blood staining the wet bed.

"I am... okay..." Bai Lihua managed to squeeze out these three words despite the pain in her body.

"It’ll go away soon." Su Yang began moving his body a moment later, thrusting his beast inside Bai Lihua’s bloody cave.

Meanwhile, Bai Lihua clenched her jaw to endure the pain. However, she gradually loosened her jaw as the pleasure began overshadowing the pain, and after a few minutes of cultivation, Bai Lihua could only feel pleasure coming from her lower body that rippled throughout the rest of her body.

Pap! Pap! Pap!

Su Yang pounded Bai Lihua’s wet cave with his dragon reaching the deepest parts for many minutes without rest, and Bai Lihua’s little sister continuously flowed with Yin Qi the entire time, climaxing again and again with barely any breaks in-between each of them.

"I can’t... I can’t handle this anymore, Su Yang! My body and mind are going to break at this rate!" Bai Lihua exclaimed sometime later.

"I know when someone is near their limit, and although you may feel like that, you are actually nowhere near your limit, and I am going to prove that to you!" After his sentence ended, Su Yang suddenly began moving his hips even faster than before.

"Aaaaaah~!"

Bai Lihua moaned sharply, yet she did not tell Su Yang to stop, and to her surprise, after they cultivated for a few more minutes, her condition suddenly improved, allowing her to endure the cultivation for longer.
