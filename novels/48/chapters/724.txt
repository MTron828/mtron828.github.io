Chapter 725 Let Her Watch

"Xiao Rong? Did something happen to her?" Su Yang asked with raised eyebrows.

"No, there’s nothing wrong. I just didn’t think it would take this long to teach her about ’being mature’," Qin Liangyu said.

Su Yang laughed out loud after hearing her words, and he said, "Well, she’s a magical beast that never had a proper interaction with humans until we met."

"Furthermore, Ghost Cats, in general, are slow learners when it comes to emotions and whatnot, not to mention their Ancestors, Phantom Cats. While she may be incredibly powerful when it comes to spiritual techniques and a fast learner for other things, Xiao Rong is not very good with emotions— kind of like Qiuyue."

"If you can’t take it anymore, you can simply just quit. Although it’s okay to be taught by others about maturity, Xiao Rong won’t understand the essence and true meaning behind maturity, so even if she acts mature on the outside, she’s still a mere child in her heart, and that’s not something that can really be taught by others."

Qin Liangyu nodded and said, "I know, but I cannot give up on her now— not after putting so much effort into it! I am going to make sure Xiao Rong becomes a proper young lady!"

Seeing Qin Liangyu’s resolution that resembled a mother wanting her child to grow up properly, Su Yang said with a smile, "Since you are working so hard, do you want me to help you relax a bit? It’s been a while since we last cultivated, after all."

Qin Liangyu’s eyes flashed with excitement after hearing his words, and she quickly nodded, "Okay!"

Sometime later, Qin Liangyu followed Su Yang into the Yin Yang Pavilion.

"Xiao Rong should still be in my room right now..." Qin Liangyu suddenly said to him.

"That’s fine. There are plenty of empty rooms in this building," Su Yang responded.

A few minutes later, they entered one of the unoccupied rooms and locked the doors.

Su Yang then pulled Qin Liangyu to the bed and began kissing her.

"Mmm..."

Su Yang’s hands roamed under Qin Liangyu’s clothes as they kissed.

Sometime later, Qin Liangyu removed her clothes and tossed them to the side of the bed before spreading her legs so Su Yang could have full access.

With Qin Liangyu’s closed slit in his view, Su Yang quickly kneeled beside the bed and began eating her pink meat.

"Mmmm~"

"Aaahn~!"

"Ooooh~"

Qin Liangyu moaned softly as Su Yang feasted on her body.

Once Qin Liangyu’s lower lips were fully soaking wet, Su Yang removed his clothes and prepared to insert his meatstick into her body.

After rubbing his stiff rod between her slit for a few moments, Su Yang penetrated her small hole.

"Aaaah!" Qin Liangyu clutched the bedsheets as Su Yang’s large rod stretched the deepest parts of her cave.

"Are you ready?" Su Yang asked her a moment later.

Qin Liangyu nodded her head with a passionate gaze.

"Then here I—"

However, right as Su Yang moved his hips, his movements immediately stopped.

"What’s the matter, Su Yang?" Qin Liangyu asked him after seeing this.

"Well..." Su Yang turned his head around, and to his surprise, a little girl with peerless facial features was standing by the window.

"X-Xiao Rong?!" Qin Liangyu’s eyes widened with surprise when she noticed Xiao Rong’s presence, and she immediately grabbed a blanket to cover herself, acting almost like a wife getting caught in the act by someone she didn’t want to find out.

"How long have you been there, Xiao Rong?" Su Yang asked her with a bittersweet smile on his face.

"Since Master began licking Sister Liangyu’s body," Xiao Rong responded with a calm expression on her face.

’That long? Phantom Cats are really scary with their ability to hide their presence flawlessly.’ Su Yang shook his head inwardly.

"Well? What do you want?" Su Yang then asked her.

Xiao Rong then shook her head in response, and then she said, "Nothing."

Su Yang nearly facepalmed at her response, and he said, "Then why are you here? You know you shouldn’t intrude on others when they are clearly not trying to be disturbed."

However, Xiao Rong merely tilted her head while looking puzzled at his words.

’Ah... I forgot... Ghost Cats are also incapable of reading the mood...’ Su Yang sighed inwardly.

After a moment of silence, Su Yang returned to looking at Qin Liangyu and said to her, "It’s pointless trying to explain our situation to her, so how about we just continue and let her watch?"

"Eh?" Qin Liangyu looked at him with wide eyes, and then she turned to look at Xiao Rong, who was staring at them intensively, looking exactly like a curious cat.

"She’ll learn about it sooner or later, and as I said before, there are some things that cannot be taught," Su Yang continued a moment later, "Xiao Rong’s bloodlines are actually incredibly lustful creatures when awakened, but they usually live a pure life. However, if she follows me, she will eventually awaken. Once that happens, even I might have trouble satisfying her lust in my current state."

"Then we should avoid exposing her to these kinds of situations even more!" Qin Liangyu said with a dazed face.

"No, her lust won’t awaken so quickly, or else her bloodline would wreak havoc in the Divine Heavens. By the time she awakens her lust, I’ll be prepared."

After pondering for a moment, Qin Liangyu nodded with a resolute expression on her face, and she said, "This is also part of being mature, so I might as well consider this as a lesson, too."

Qin Liangyu then turned to look at Xiao Rong and continued, "Xiao Rong, I am going to give you another lesson now. You can even call this the definition of becoming mature since this is when most ’young ladies’ become a ’woman’!"

"Okay." Xiao Rong nodded with enthusiasm, and she took a seat by the bed before staring at them intensively, patiently waiting for them to continue.
