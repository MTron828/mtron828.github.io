Chapter 853 - Cloud Nine Liquid

"If you don’t want to take care of the children, I’ll call someone else to replace you, grandfather." Xie Xingfang said to him.

The color on Xie Wang’s face drained after hearing Xie Xingfang’s words.

"I only have three more months with these beautiful children and you want to replace me? Nonsense! I’m going to take care of them." Xie Wang said as he approached the babies.

"Then I’ll leave them in your care, grandfather." Xie Xingfang giggled a little before leaving the room with Su Yang.

Sometime later, they arrived at the bathroom, which was larger than Xie Xingfang’s personal room.

As Xie Xingfang prepared the bath, she asked him, "What are you going to do now?"

Su Yang approached the large square-shaped bathtub and retrieved a bottle of blue liquid.

"What’s that?" Xie Xingfang raised her eyebrows after seeing the unfamiliar liquid in Su Yang’s hands.

"Cloud Nine Liquid," he responded with a smile on his face, and he continued, "It has similar effects as the Euphoric Oil, but it’s more effective and can even enhance women’s Yin Qi permanently unlike the Euphoric Oil that only temporarily enhances your Yin Qi. It’s made out of Pure Yin Flower as well as a couple of other treasures, and it’ll make you feel like you’re on cloud nine if you bathe in it, hence its name."

Once he poured the Cloud Nine Liquid into the bath, the clear water began turning azure.

"What a pretty color..." Xie Xingfang mumbled with awe on her face.

They removed their clothes and entered the bathtub a moment later, and Xie Xingfang laid her head on Su Yang’s shoulders as they enjoyed the warm liquid.

"This feels really good..." Xie Xingfang released a satisfied sigh.

After submerging their bodies in this azure liquid for many minutes, Xie Xingfang said, "I think I’m ready."

Hearing her words, Su Yang immediately turned his head and kissed her soft lips.

A few minutes of kissing later, Xie Xingfang stood up and turned around, showing her perfect round b.u.t.t.o.c.k.s and her wet slit that was dripping with Yin Qi.

"Go head... stick it inside me..." she said to him.

Su Yang also stood up, revealing the raging dragon between his legs.

After rubbing his stiff rod on her cave a couple of times, Su Yang inserted it inside her body.

"Mmmm~!" Xie Xingfang released a l.u.s.tful m.o.a.n while she gently bit on her lips.

Once his rod was touching the end of her cave, Su Yang began moving his h.i.p.s, causing the azure water to slash around, creating constant waves in the bath.

"Oooh... This feels very different for some reason... Are you using a new technique or something?" Xie Xingfang asked him after she noticed this.

"No, it’s just the effects of the water. Your sense of p.l.e.a.s.u.r.e changed after bathing in the liquid. How do you like it?" Su Yang explained to her.

"It feels very unique yet good at the same time... I don’t know how to describe it, but it’s definitely a very pleasant feeling!"

"Then let’s enjoy this until the effects go away!" Su Yang said as his movements quickened.

"Aaaah~!" Xie Xingfang m.o.a.n.e.d in response.

"I’ve said this before, but your hole grew even tighter ever since your delivery." Su Yang said a moment later.

"Do you like it?" she asked him with a smile on her face.

"I love it. This gripping sensation around me... I will never grow tired of it even if we do it every day."

Su Yang could feel Xie Xingfang’s cave squeezing his rod and a strong vacuuming sensation every time he moved his h.i.p.s back. If he didn’t know any better, he would’ve mistaken Xie Xingfang as a maiden with this type of hole!

The two of them cultivated with each other for nearly the entire day until the azure-colored water returned to a clear and colorless liquid, and Su Yang ended the session with a pump of hot Yang Qi inside her cave.

"A wedding dress, huh? We’ll bring all of the best stylists in the Eastern Continent together to create the best dress for you!" Xie Wang spoke with excitement, acting as though he was the one who’ll be wearing the wedding dress.

Meanwhile, Lord Xie began sending invitations the next day to all of the major sects and powerful families in the Eastern Continent, inviting them to participate in Su Yang and Xie Xingfang’s celebration.

Although some people didn’t want to participate, such as the Fang Family, they reluctantly agreed to participate since they didn’t want to offend Su Yang anymore.

After returning to the Profound Blossom Sect, Su Yang immediately noticed that Qiuyue had returned from the Southern Continent.

"How’s the mirror?" Su Yang asked her.

"After observing the place where the mirror used to be before it disappeared, I noticed the spiritual energy in that area was getting less and less, almost like it is being absorbed by something. I think this is a sign that the mirror will reappear soon." Qiuyue said.

Su Yang nodded, "Sounds about right. We’ll camp around that area a few days before it opens."

"Su Yang, I have been wondering... How do you plan on bringing everyone with us to the Divine Heavens? We’re not a small group of people anymore. It’s not safe if we go inside like this."

"Did you forget about that device in your possession, Qiuyue?" Su Yang suddenly said.

"Device? What device?" Qiuyue raised her eyebrows.

"The Spatial Device, silly." Su Yang said, reminding her of the Spatial Device that was a small world of its own.

"I’m going to put everyone that’ll be coming with us inside so that they’ll be able to travel with us safely," he continued.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com
