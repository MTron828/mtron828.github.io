Chapter 701 - Ensnaring Formation

After tossing the Four Elements Root into the pill cauldron, Su Yang immediately began cleaning the impurities within the root before mixing it with the other ingredients.

A few minutes later, the Four Elements Root was completely mixed with the other ingredients.

A few more minutes later, Su Yang said, "You can stop now."

Hearing his words, Zhu Mengyi retrieved her Azure Flames.

However, Su Yang continued to control his alchemy flames for another minute before gradually making the flames smaller until it completely disappeared.

He then removed the lid on the pill cauldron and retrieved the pale green pill from inside.

"What kind of pill is that?" Zhu Mengyi asked him afterward with some sweat on her forehead.

"It’s a pill that will strengthen one’s immunity towards poison and all toxic substances," Su Yang said.

"Why do you need a pill like that?" Zhu Mengyi raised her eyebrows in a puzzled manner.

"It’s a long story, so you should ask them." Su Yang pointed at the Xie Family with his gaze.

He then continued, "Anyway, now that I have the pill, we can enter the Abandoned Forest at any time. I’ll give you guys some time to prepare. In the meantime, I’ll go check on the Devil Blood Ginseng."

"Do you need one of us to come with you?" Xie Xingfang asked him.

"No, it’s fine. I’m just going to harvest the Devil Blood Ginseng before coming right back— it shouldn’t take more than half an hour. Once I come back, we can talk about the Abandoned Forest."

Xie Xingfang nodded.

Su Yang left the room shortly later.

"Should I show you the guest rooms?" Xie Xingfang asked Zhu Mengyi and the other two afterward, and they nodded.

Once Su Yang left Snowfall City, he flew directly to the Southern Region, where the bandit hideout was.

However, as he approached the location, he noticed a group of people standing around the exact area he was trying to go, and they appeared to be young disciples from some sect.

Su Yang decided to descend right before these disciples, and when they noticed Su Yang, they quickly said to him, "Stop right there! Don’t come any closer!"

Hearing their words, Su Yang looked left and right, almost as though he was looking for something. A few moments later, he returned to looking at the disciples before speaking in a puzzled voice, "If my eyes are not playing tricks on me, we are currently outside, not your house, so who are you to tell me to stay away?"

"Can’t you tell by looking at our uniforms?! Are you blind?!" One of the disciples quickly responded with hostility.

"..."

Su Yang looked at their uniforms with a serious expression on his face, even narrowing his eyes. However, he still shook his head a few seconds later, "I have no idea. Who are you guys?"

The disciple immediately fumed, "You can’t recognize the Golden Star Formation Sect’s uniform?! Have you been living under a rock for most of your life?!"

"Golden Star Formation Sect? Never heard of you idiots." Su Yang said with a nonchalant expression on his face.

"How dare you!"

Right as the disciple took a step towards Su Yang with an aggressive-looking expression on his face, another voice resounded, "What’s the commotion about?"

The disciple immediately halted his movements and turned around to bow to the old man that was walking towards them.

"Sect Master Qian!"

The disciples there bowed to him.

The old man known as Sect Master Qian looked at Su Yang with a frown on his face, and he spoke a moment later, "What is your purpose here, young man? Can’t you tell that this place has already been occupied by the Golden Star Formation Sect?"

Because the old man is only at the peak of the Earth Spirit Realm, he was unable to sense Su Yang’s Heavenly Spirit Realm cultivation base, hence his nonchalant attitude.

"I should be asking you that question— what are a bunch of people from a sect doing in the middle of nowhere? As far as I’m concerned, there is only an empty cave over there," Su Yang said as he pointed to the cave behind them.

"Don’t stick your nose where it doesn’t belong! And how dare you address the Sect Master so casually?! Do you know who you are talking to?!" The disciple immediately shouted at him.

The old man, however, remained calm, "My disciple is right. You shouldn’t stick your nose where it doesn’t belong. This is the Golden Star Formation Sect’s business. I don’t know who you are or which sect you belong to, but you should leave before I find out, or..."

"Or what?" Su Yang stood there with a casual smile on his face, seemingly unwilling to leave. "What are you going to do?"

Seeing this, the old man shook his head and sighed, "Young people these days have no respect for their elders." FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

"Very well, since you insist on staying here, I’ll help you." The old man suddenly waved his sleeves, and a few seconds later, a small semi-transparent barrier in the shape of a box appeared around Su Yang, trapping him inside.

"This is..." Su Yang looked at the tiny and thin formation that surrounded him with a speechless expression on his face.

"Hahaha! You’ve screwed yourself now! That is the Ensnaring Formation! You are now trapped inside, and unless Sect Master Qian assists, you will not be able to leave!" The disciples there began laughing loudly after seeing Su Yang’s situation.

"Don’t worry, young man. I won’t kill you. However, for disobeying your elders, I will have to punish you a little. Therefore, I will keep you trapped inside the formation until you repent your mistakes," said Sect Master Qian.

"Anyway, I am going to return to working on the profound formation in the cave." Sect Master Qian then turned around and began walking back to the cave.

"Hahahaha!" However, Su Yang’s sudden laughter immediately stopped the old man in his tracks.
