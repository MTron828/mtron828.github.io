Chapter 679 Legs in the Air

"Now that you know, are you still going to waste it? My Yang Qi is extremely precious and healthy for one’s body and cultivation. Do you know how many women used to crave for my Yang Qi?" Su Yang said to Lian Li.

When he was still active as a Dual Cultivator in the Divine Heavens, beauties from across the universe would seek him just so they could receive his Yang Qi, as it would provide a significant boost to their cultivation base.

Lian Li looked at the white substances that were sticking to her body with a dazed face for a good moment before she wiped it with her fingers and put it into her mouth.

And since she got to actually taste his Yang Qi this time, Lian Li was pleasantly surprised by the sweet taste that aroused her taste buds.

"Mm..."

Lian Li licked her fingers in an erotic manner for the next few minutes as she slowly cleaned the Yang Qi on her body.

Once she was done, Su Yang stood up and said to her, "Take off your clothes and lay on the bed."

Lian Li immediately nodded with eagerness and removed her clothes before laying on the bed with her arms crossed across her breasts and with a bashful expression on her face.

Seeing this, Su Yang grabbed Lian Li by her ankles and lifted her legs high into the air while spreading them wide simultaneously.

"W-What kind of position is this?!" Lian Li cried out loud after seeing this embarrassing position that revealed everything to him, feeling even more naked despite already being completely naked.

However, Su Yang did not say anything and even pushed her legs further into the air— until her body was at an angle and her butt was sticking towards the ceiling.

Su Yang then kneeled on the bed and approached the wet slit that was slightly spread with his head, before giving it a passionate kiss.

"Aaaaaaah~!" Lian Li moaned in a delightful voice.

Hearing her beautiful-sounding voice, Su Yang used his tongue to tease the pink pearl that was swelled up from the sensation of pleasure.

"Aaaaaaahh~!"

"Aaaah~!"

"Mmmmh~!"

Lian Li quickly forgot about her embarrassing position and indulged herself in the pleasure, even spreading her legs wider for him.

"I’m cumming! It’s coming out!" Lian Li exclaimed, and her body gushed with Yin Qi a moment later, showering Su Yang and herself with it.

Once Lian Li had her first climax, Su Yang stood up on the bed positioned himself right above Lian Li.

He then placed Lian Li’s slender and smooth legs onto his shoulder, before placing his hands near her head, looking like he was trying to do push-ups.

"Can you see it?" Su Yang suddenly asked her.

Lian Li looked at her wet flower and Su Yang’s massive sword that was directly above her hole in a very clear view.

"Very clearly..." she mumbled in a bashful voice.

"Good— then watch carefully as I pierce your seal for the first time in your life..."

Su Yang said as he pressed the tip of his sword against her soaking wet slit and pushed it into her body slightly.

"Aaaaah!" Lian Li released a painful cry as her entrance was stretched to a degree which it has never experienced before, and she could see blood flowing from her hole a moment later.

’I-I didn’t think it would be this painful!’ she cried inwardly, feeling intense pain as Su Yang’s sword pierced deeper into her hole, tearing her inner walls apart.

"Don’t worry, it is only painful at first." Su Yang said to her.

"Un..." she nodded her head.

"Agh...!"

Lian Li tightly clenched her jaw from the pain, yet there was this oddly satisfying feeling from it.

Once Su Yang’s entire sword was inside Lian Li’s body, he began pulling his shaft from her hole until only his tip was left inside, and that’s when he propelled his body forward, shoving his thick rod into her body again. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

"Aaaaah~!"

Lian Li moaned loudly. Even though it was still painful, a clear sensation of pleasure could also be felt shortly afterward.

"Mmm~!"

"Aaah~!"

"Oooohhhh...!"

Lian Li stared at Su Yang in his eyes with an enchanted gaze, and she would look at her own hole being pounded by his shaft every so often.

After a few minutes of casual thrusting, Lian Li could no longer feel anything that was not pleasure, and her entire body was burning with passion and desire.

However, when Su Yang suddenly stopped moving, Lian Li looked at him with a puzzled look on her face.

"What happened? Why did you stop?" She asked him.

He smiled and said, "To give you some time to prepare yourself mentally."

"Huh?" Lian Li’s eyes widened at his words. What did he mean by that?

"I promised you that I would make you feel a hundred times more blissful than last night, right? Well, I am going to fulfill that promise now."

After saying those words, Su Yang began moving his hips again, but his movements were much fiercer and intense than before.

"Aaaah!"

Lian Li could feel her lower body suddenly flare up with passion, almost like it was on fire.

"It’s hot! It feels so hot!"

Lian Li’s body trembled uncontrollably, and more Yin Qi gushed from her body.

*Pap*! *Pap*! *Pap*!

The entire bed shook as Su Yang pounded Lian Li’s body. However, Su Yang was not done with Lian Li, as he suddenly pinched her nipples with his fingers, even pulling them slightly.

"Aaaaaah~! I am going to go crazy!" Lian Li exclaimed as her eyes were rolled back from the intense pleasure that electrocuted her entire body, feeling as though there were tiny electric snakes traveling all over and within her body.

Many minutes of intense cultivation later, Su Yang said to her, "I’m going to release my Yang Qi again."

"G-Go ahead!" Lian Li nodded her head without thinking.

After a few more thrusts, Su Yang released his Yang Qi into Lian Li’s body, filling her hole and uterus with his hot Yang Qi.

"Aaaaaaah~!" Lian Li also released a long cry of satisfaction.

’I-I really won’t get pregnant from this, right...?’ Lian Li thought to herself afterward as she watched her hole overflow with Yang Qi.
