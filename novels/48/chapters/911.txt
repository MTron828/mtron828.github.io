Chapter 912 - She Will Definitely Come

Another week has passed since Su Yang and Xiao Rong began traversing the mountain valley, giving them one more week to reach the Frozen Azure Cave.

However, they were not even close to reaching their destination, only managing to traverse a fourth of it.​​

"Looks like we’re really going to be late if we continue at this pace..." Su Yang sighed.

As much as he wanted to just take out his flying treasure and speed through the mountain valley, he didn’t have a death wish.

After pondering for a moment, Su Yang said, "Alright, Xiao Rong, we’re going to speed up. It may be risky, but if we don’t reach the Frozen Azure Cave and Ziyi leaves, our entire journey here would become pointless."

Xiao Rong then asked him, "Master, why are you so certain that she will be at the Frozen Azure Cave? What if this person is not there?"

Su Yang smiled and said, "That’s not possible. If she heard the message I told Mu Yuechan, she will definitely come. After all, that’s the same words I told her when we paired up to acquire the Azure Lotus thousands of years ago."

"As for Mu Yuechan, I know her well enough. If she says that she will do something, she will do it, so I don’t have to worry about her not conveying the message to Ziyi. Of course, Mu Yuechan could delay telling her the message, but I hope that isn’t the case."

"In any case, I have no doubt that she will be there once we arrive." Su Yang said.

Xiao Rong nodded.

"Then make sure you follow along. I am going to speed up a lot now."

After taking a deep breath, Su Yang began using the movement technique Nine Astral Steps, moving many miles with a single step.

Of course, since he sped up his movement, he also had to increase his alert even more.

A few minutes later, the instant Su Yang notices a presence, he would instantly change directions and go another route without even taking the time to see what kind of magical beast it was— if it was even a magical beast in the first place.

However, with that being said, there are eccentric and unfathomable people out there who would come to the center of the Frozen Azgard to train and look for treasures, so there may be a couple of people in the mountain valley right now.

A few hours later, Su Yang stopped to rest.

Although he could move without stopping for many days if he was just using the Nine Astral Steps, his surveillance technique was very taxing on his mind and spiritual energy, so he could only move continuously for a single day like this. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

As for why he stopped only after just a few hours despite having enough energy for the whole day, it was simply because he didn’t want to exhaust all of his spiritual energy just in case he needed it to deal with any unexpected encounters.

After an hour of resting, they started moving again.

The next day, after an entire week of no incidents, Su Yang and Xiao Rong finally encountered their first magical beast after failing to notice it because it had suppressed its presence.

"Divine Sword!"

The moment Su Yang realized that they had been noticed by a magical beast, he immediately used his strongest sword technique, Divine Sword.

However, unlike when he fought against Patriarch Gold, the Divine Sword didn’t have any extravagant appearances and remained the size of a normal sword, as he didn’t want to attract the nearby magical beasts while fighting this one.

The white bear released a deafening roar when it was struck by the Divine Sword that constantly drained its strength.

It then turned to look at Su Yang before running at him, acting as though there wasn’t a sword in its body.

"Xiao Rong!"

Su Yang called out to her.

Xiao Rong, who had been standing behind him, used her spiritual energy to suppress the magical beast even further by attacking it mentally.

Su Yang then used Nine Astral Steps to approach the white bear without getting too close to it.

Once he was behind the magical beast, he pointed his finger at the white bear before sending out a single strand of Sword Will that pierced the white bear’s head from behind, instantly killing it.

"Let’s get out of here before other magical beasts arrive!"

After killing the magical beast, Su Yang immediately used Nine Astral Steps to leave the scene without even bothering to check the corpse, and Xiao Rong followed him.

After another hour of running without rest, Su Yang finally stopped and began panting heavily.

It’d taken him nearly all of his spiritual energy just to take care of the magical beast that appeared to be around the Divine Saint Realm. If that single strike didn’t kill the magical beast, they would’ve been in trouble.

"Keep watch for me, Xiao Rong. I am going to recover my spiritual energy," he said to her before taking a seat and absorbing the spiritual energy around them as quickly as possible.

Half an hour later, before Su Yang could recover his spiritual energy fully, Xiao Rong called out to him, "Master!"

Su Yang’s eyes immediately snapped open. Once he determined the location of the presence in half a second, he wasted no time using Nine Astral Steps, disappearing from his location in less than a second.
