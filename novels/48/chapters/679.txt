Chapter 680 Nearly Climaxing Every Minute

After Su Yang removed his sword from her body, Lian Li looked at her loosened hole that was flowing with Yang Qi with a dazed face.

’My body is no longer pure, and I was defiled by the man who I tried to poison last night for humiliating me in public...’ Lian Li tried to comprehend the unbelievable events that have occurred within the past two days.

After pondering for a while, Lian Li turned to look at Su Yang, who immediately sat in the lotus position with his eyes closed after their cultivation session, seemingly trying to cultivate.

’How can he be so calm? You just took Emperor Lian’s daughter’s virginity, you know!? Any normal individual should be jumping in joy right now!’ Lian Li cried inwardly, feeling as though her pride and status had been disregarded.

But alas, little did she know that Su Yang has slept with many women who were real ’Goddesses’ and ’Empresses’, much less a mere princess in some small world, and one’s status didn’t matter to him, as he only saw them as cultivation partners.

An hour or two later, Su Yang opened his eyes, which flickered with a profound light, causing his aura to skyrocket.

’He had a breakthrough?’ Lian Li, who was resting on the bed raised her eyebrows after witnessing his cultivation breakthrough.

Su Yang took a deep breath before turning to look at Lian Li with a handsome smile on his face, "Thank you for helping me reach the eighth level Heavenly Spirit Realm. Your Pure Yin Essence helped me a lot, and I am already close to reaching the ninth level even though I just had a breakthrough."

"..."

Lian Li was speechless. Since when did breakthroughs become so easy— to the point where one can increase an entire level after having sex once? Were Dual Cultivators always this powerful?

Su Yang then continued to speak, "And since I am full of energy after the breakthrough, we can continue to cultivate for a few more sessions— that is if you want to."

"I...I want to continue!" Lian Li quickly nodded her head. There was simply no way she could refuse such an enticing offer after what she experienced.

"Then let’s see what you can do by yourself first."

Su Yang laid on the bed with his sword pointing towards the ceiling. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

"Go ahead. Use it as you please," he said to her with a smile.

"As I please...?" Lian Li raised her eyebrows. How is she supposed to use it?

After pondering for a moment, she walked to stand above Su Yang’s body before sitting on his sword.

Once the sword was inside her body, Lian Li began riding his rod slowly, increasing her speed and intensity once she was feeling more comfortable.

"Mmm..."

"Aaaah~!"

"Aaaahn..."

"Ooooh~!"

After Lian Li rode Su Yang for many minutes without any breaks, Su Yang suddenly grabbed her by the waist and began assisting her with her hip movements.

"Aaahh!"

"Ahhhhhh~!"

"Aaaahn~!"

Lian Li’s body trembled with delight as Su Yang also began thrusting his hips into the air whilst pulling her body down at the same time, creating a strong clapping sound each time their bodies connected.

And for the next hour, they would continue in this position. By the time the hour was over, Lian Li was sweating all over her body, causing it to glisten like the sea during a sunny day, and she’d climaxed over fifty times during this intense marathon— experiencing nearly one climax every minute.

"No more! no more! I can’t take this anymore!" Lian Li cried out loud.

"Then we’ll end it with this!" Su Yang increased his speed significantly for a few seconds before releasing his Yang Qi into her.

"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh~~~!"

Lian Li also released a long and extended moan, feeling her already fully stomach expanding from the excess amount of Yang Qi flowing into her body.

Once the Yang Qi stopped coming, Lian Li collapsed onto Su Yang’s chest while panting for air, feeling completely drained.

Su Yang did not move and allowed Lian Li to lay on his warm chest until she was ready to move again.

However, Lian Li did not move even an hour later and remained unmoving like a stone statue, yet she was not asleep or unconscious.

"Hey..." she suddenly mumbled to him a few minutes later.

"What is it?"

"Do you think we can do this again in the future?" she asked him with a rosy face.

"..."

After a moment of silence, Su Yang spoke in a calm voice, "I cannot make any promises."

"Why not? Is it because of what happened yesterday? If you don’t like me, then I am willing to change! I will become someone you can like!" Lian Li lifted herself slightly to look at him with a saddened expression on her face, looking like a puppy who just got disowned.

"No, it has nothing to do with your little prank nor does it have anything to do with your character. I have slept with women who really tried to kill me before, and I have slept with women who are clearly crazy, so your little prank and princess attitude are not even worth mentioning." Su Yang said to her.

"Then why? Why can’t we do this again? If I have to be your woman, then I..."

Su Yang pressed one of his fingers against her soft lips before interrupting her, "You’re Emperor Lian’s daughter, right? Since I will be visiting him soon, we continue talking about this once you learn a little bit more about me."

"You’re going to be visiting my father?" Lian Li looked at him with a surprised face.

"Yes, I have something I want from him," he nodded. "And if you’re serious about becoming my woman, we should probably also let your father know about it, right?"

"..."

After a moment of silence, Lian Li said, "Okay, I understand. When you meet with my father, I want to go with you."
