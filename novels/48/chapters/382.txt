After a moment of silence, Xie Xingfang silently nodded her head at Su Yang and proceeded to return to her seat.

Meanwhile, the Profound Blossom Sect and the spectators all looked at her with a dumbfounded look, with all of them wondering what that was all about.

"You couldn’t wait a few more days before speaking with him?" Lord Xie felt an urge to sigh when he looked at her.

"It’s been many days since I last spoke with him, and I don’t want him to forget my existence, especially when he’s surrounded by beauties in all directions, so I couldn’t help myself."

Lord Xie immediately became speechless at her unbefitting behavior for someone of her stature. After all, it should be Su Yang approaching her, not the other way around. It’ll only make her seem desperate.

A princess and beauty like Xie Xingfang acting this desperate when she can literally have any man on this land? It was simply too unbelievable, almost like a fairytale.

"W-What the hell was that?" Bai Lihua pointed at the stage with trembling fingers. "Why would the princess approach them, even congratulating them?"

Hearing her shocked voice, Wang Shuren shrugged her shoulders and said, "Maybe she’s greatly impressed by the Profound Blossom Sect?"

"So she’s impressed by them but completely ignored the Burning Lotus Sect, who is clearly more impressive in many ways more than them? Don’t you feel a little bit unhappy about that?"

"Although it would be great if the princess of the Xie Family gave us even a little bit of recognition, at the end of the day, it’s Lord Xie that we must impress."

"That makes sense..." Bai Lihua nodded.

The most important person in this place is Lord Xie. As long as they manage to impress him during this tournament, they will receive many benefits and will also be recognized by the entire world as a bonus.

A few minutes later, the Profound Blossom Sect returned to their seats as spectators.

"I must admit, you are quite a formidable bunch." Bai Lihua said to them.

She then turned to look at Liu Lanzhi and continued to speak, "These girls are lucky to have such a competent Sect Leader. You should be proud."

"Hehe..."

All of the disciples showed a bashful smile, especially Liu Lanzhi, who was trying her hardest to not smile from ear to ear. However, once she recalled that it was Su Yang who did all the work, she showed an embarrassed smile and said, "I didn’t do anything. It’s all because of Su Yang that we are here today."

Bai Lihua thought Liu Lanzhi was only being humble and casually nodded, "If you say so."

A few hours later, the second day of the tournament came to an end, and the remaining 50 sects gathered once again to draw a lot for their next match.

"Who has number 9?" Zi Dong asked after everyone had picked a number.

A few seconds later, Liu Lanzhi raised her hand, and a few meters away from her, a middle-aged man also raised his hand.

When Liu Lanzhi saw the face of that middle-aged man, her eyes widened with shock.

"The Profound Blossom Sect and the Burning Lotus Sect, huh?" Zi Dong nodded as he wrote their sect onto the board.

"The Profound Blossom Sect is doomed. Although they were lucky enough to have gotten this far, they will now have to face the Burning Lotus Sect."

The Sect Masters there believed that tomorrow would be the last match for the Profound Blossom Sect.

"To think we’d pick the Burning Lotus Sect out of all the participants..." Liu Lanzhi sighed.

If she knew this would’ve happened, she should’ve allowed Su Yang to pick the number.

"Why does it matter if we face them now or later? If they don’t lose, we will have to fight them sooner or later." Su Yang casually said.

"That’s true, but I had hoped that we would face them later if not for the last match..." Liu Lanzhi sighed again.

While Liu Lanzhi and Su Yang spoke, the Burning Lotus Sect’s Master approached them with a serious expression on his face. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

"Senior Huo Yuanjia." Liu Lanzhi respectfully bowed to him.

Huo Yuanjia nodded at her before turning to look at Su Yang with a frown on his face.

"Don’t think I have forgotten what had happened on that day for even one second, as it has been on my mind every day since then. The humiliation that I — we all had to face — we shall pay that back ten-folds!"

When Liu Lanzhi heard Huo Yuanjia’s words, her eyes widened with shock.

"W-What is he talking about, Su Yang? Did you do something to offend them?" she mumbled to him.

Su Yang raised an eyebrow and spoke in a puzzled tone, "While I am prideful of many things about myself, my memory is not one of them, so if you don’t mind, can you help me recall what had happened?"

Huo Yuanjia’s eyebrows twitched after hearing Su Yang’s words, feeling a strong urge to beat him up right this moment.

"I don’t know what kind of tricks you had used on that day, but it will not work here. What’s more, we are no longer the same as before. If you think you will step all over us like that time, it will not happen tomorrow!"

"E-Excuse me, Senior Huo. If you don’t mind, can you give me an explanation? It seems like Su Yang had offended you..." Liu Lanzhi asked him.

Huo Yuanjia looked at her and spoke, "Don’t worry, it’s only a small matter, and this is between him and us. Even if he’s affiliated with the Profound Blossom Sect, we will not cause you guys any trouble, especially since we are in an alliance."

Liu Lanzhi was speechless for a moment before saying, "Even if you say that... he’s also a Sect Master like me. If you cause trouble for him, it’ll also mean trouble for the sect."

Huo Yuanjia merely smiled at her words before turning around and walking away.

"Really, Su Yang. What did you do to them? And when did this happen?" she looked at him with a frown. "Whatever you did, if you don’t resolve this quickly, it will definitely affect our alliance."

"Like he’d said, you don’t have to worry. It’s just a small matter that will be resolved very soon," he said with a smile.
