Chapter 737 Wang Shuren“s Decision

Hearing Cai Yan’s words, Su Yang nodded with a smile on his handsome face, and he said, "Although I can help you reach the Earth Spirit Realm in a few months, it requires you to cultivate with me nearly every day, so you’ll have to stay near me until you reach your goals. Are you willing to stay in the Profound Blossom Sect for the time being?"

Cai Yan nodded, "I will let my parents know."

Sometime later, Su Yang brought Luo Yixiao and Senior Zeng back to the Divine Nature Garden, and Cai Yan returned to her own Cai Family.

After Su Yang dropped off Cai Yan, he returned to the Burning Lotus Sect to train Wang Shuren some more.

Meanwhile, Cai Yan was approached by her parents regarding what happened a few days ago with the Xiang Family.

"Yan’er, is it true that you are in that kind of relationship with Su Yang?" Her father asked her with a serious expression on his face.

Cai Yan nodded, and she said with a calm expression on her face, "I will be offering my body to him soon, and I will also be staying in the Profound Blossom Sect so he can help me reach the Earth Spirit Realm." ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

"The Earth Spirit Realm!" Her parents exchanged looks with each other, their eyes filled with excitement.

Even though their negotiation with the Xiang Family was a failure, that could be considered as a blessing disguised as a misfortune!

Not only is Su Yang also from one of the Four Great Families, but he’s also the Sect Master of the Profound Blossom Sect, the most famous sect in the Eastern Continent as of this moment! Furthermore, Su Yang is recognized as the number one genius of the Eastern Continent who achieved the Heavenly Spirit Realm at a very young age!

Compared to the Xiang Family and Xiang Zhongfa, Su Yang was countless times more amazing and worthy! In fact, Su Yang is, without doubt, the number one choice in the entire Eastern Continent overall! If one were to question one million women in the Eastern Continent who they would consider as an ideal partner with Su Yang a part of the choice, 99 percent if not all of them would say it’s Su Yang!

In terms of status, Su Yang was superior. In terms of looks, Su Yang was superior. In terms of talents, Su Yang was superior. No matter what aspects they compared between Su Yang and the Xiang Family, Su Yang would always come out top.

"Listen carefully, Yan’er! Do not screw this up no matter what! There are already people saying that Su Yang might be the next Lord Xie! If you follow him, our Cai Family will surely rise, perhaps even becoming a Great Family in the future!"

Hearing her parents’ words, Cai Yan could only shake her head inwardly.

"I am going to prepare for my stay at the Profound Blossom Sect. I will be there for at least half a year," Cai Yan said to them a moment later.

"Okay! If you need anything, just let us know!" Her parents said, completely supporting her decision.

Meanwhile, after Su Yang returned to the Burning Lotus Sect, he went straight into Wang Shuren’s room, who was already naked and on the bed, her gaze filled with enthusiasm and lust. A few moments later, they began cultivating, and Wang Shuren’s sexy voice quickly filled the room.

After a few hours, Wang Shuren collapsed on the bed with an exhausted expression and her body covered in hot Yang Qi and sweat.

"Mmm... Your body is adapting very nicely, and your endurance is improving at a rapid pace," Su Yang said to her afterward. "It won’t be long until we can continue cultivating for an entire day at that intensity."

Wang Shuren turned her body over and said in an exhausted voice, "My body is also used to being pleasured by you... I don’t know what I’ll do once you leave this world."

Su Yang smiled at her words and said, "You can follow me to the Divine Heavens."

"..." Wang Shuren closed her eyes and became silent for a moment before speaking in a mumbling voice, "Perhaps I really should..."

Wang Shuren suddenly moved her arms until her hands were between her legs, and she wiped her wet slit with one of her fingers, picking up some of the Yang Qi that was overflowing her hole.

After staring at the sticky substance on her fingers for a moment, Wang Shuren said, "Su Yang... Is it too late for me to want to follow you?"

"What do you think?" he responded with a question.

After a moment of silence, she spoke, "Over these last few months, I have been pondering about what I really wanted to do with my life. At first, when I was only in charge of a small auction house, my dream was to become a renowned Alchemist. However, after meeting you, that seemingly distant dream became a reality, and I am now one of the most recognized Alchemy Masters in the Eastern Continent with widespread fame."

"I can continue to spend the rest of my life in this small world as a top Alchemist, or I can abandon all of my fame and achievements in this world to follow you to another world, where I will once again return to being a nobody."

"However, in that world, I can continue to improve my Alchemy and experience things that are still incomprehensible to me, such as creating an entire world with alchemy flames. There’s also the Alchemy God... I really want to meet this Alchemy God and see for myself just what kind of person is at the peak of Alchemy..."

After she finished mumbling to herself, Wang Shuren suddenly stood up before kneeling back down on the bed and kowtowing to Su Yang, "Su Yang... I want to follow you to the Divine Heavens! I am no longer satisfied with my achievements in this world after seeing just how much more there is to alchemy! Please! Take me with you! In return, I will give you my everything!"
