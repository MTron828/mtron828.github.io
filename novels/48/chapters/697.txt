Chapter 698 - Hundreds of Millions

After covering the sleeping Lian Li with a blanket, Su Yang left the room and headed outside again.

And the instant he went outside, Wu Jingjing and Zhu Mengyi approached him with excited expressions on their beautiful faces.

"Did you just give Sister Li your Family Seal?" Zhu Mengyi asked him with bright eyes.

"I felt my Family Seal reacting sometime ago!" Wu Jingjing said.

Seeing their reaction, Su Yang nodded with a smile on his face, "Yes, Lian Li is also a part of our family now. She’s sleeping now."

"Family Seal? What is that?" When the Xie Family overheard their conversation, Xie Wang decided to ask out of sheer curiosity.

"A Family Seal is something the head of a family gives to their partners, indicating that they belong to a certain family. Of course, Family Seals are not that common as it only exists in families with harems," Su Yang explained to them.

"Here, this is what a Family Seal looks like—" Zhu Mengyi slightly adjusted her clothes to show off her Family Seal to the Xie Family, feeling like a child trying to show off her achievements.

"..."

Lord Xie and Xie Wang blushed slightly when they saw Zhu Mengyi’s peerless skin, feeling envious of Su Yang that he’d managed to secure not one, not two, but three peerless beauties in a single trip to the Holy Central Continent.

’This lucky f.u.c.ker... If given enough time, he might actually seduce every single woman on the Eastern Continent!’ Lord Xie cried inwardly.

"So... does this mean you are basically husband and wives?" Xie Xingfang suddenly asked.

"There is no such thing as wives or concubines in the Su Family, as I treat and love everyone the same amount no matter their status or background," Su Yang said to her.

"Treating everyone the same..." Xie Xingfang mumbled with a profound look in her gaze.

"How many people are in your family now, Su Yang?" Xie Wang suddenly asked.

"Oh, I also want to know the answer to that question," Zhu Mengyi said with curiosity on her face.

Even Wu Jingjing turned to stare at him in silence.

"Not including the people on this flying ship and the Divine Heavens, there are only three other women who have accepted my Family Seal," Su Yang said.

"Only three?" Everybody on the boat reacted to his response with surprise, as they truly didn’t expect such a low number from someone like him. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

"What’s with the reactions? You think I hand out Family Seals like candy and give them to every woman I cultivate with?" Su Yang shook his head at their reactions.

"While I don’t expect you to give it to every woman you sleep with, I sure didn’t expect the number to be that low!" Lord Xie was the first to respond.

Su Yang then coldly snorted and said, "Considering the small number of women I have cultivated with while in this world, giving six Family Seal is already a shockingly high number. Despite cultivating with hundreds of millions of women in my previous life, I have given out less than 100 Family Seals!"

"W-Wait a damn second, Su Yang! H-Hundreds of millions of women? How is that even possible?!" Lord Xie was the first to question the ridiculous amount of women Su Yang claimed to have cultivated with.

"When you’re as handsome as me and with Yang Qi that has the same effect as valuable treasures that can boost one’s cultivation base, women would flock to you even if you do nothing but breath. In my previous life, whenever I would visit any city, there would always be a line of beautiful women willing to cultivate with me, and that line would not disappear for days on end even if I cultivated nonstop," Su Yang spoke in a prideful voice. "And hundreds of millions is only a humble estimate!"

And he continued, "Furthermore, because of my Celestial Constitution, I was even called ’living treasure’ at one point."

"Celestial Constitution? How is that any different than Heavenly Constitutions?" Xie Wang asked Su Yang with a baffled look on his face.

"Celestial Constitution is above Heavenly Constitutions but it cannot be obtained by birth. The only way one can obtain a Celestial Constitution is by gathering and merging over 100,000 Heavenly Constitutions together. Meaning, I had to cultivate with over 100,000 maidens who had a Heavenly Constitution," Su Yang explained to him.

"100,000 Heavenly Constitutions?!" Xie Wang’s jaw dropped to the floor, as it was an immense number that he cannot even begin to comprehend.

"If it can only be created by merging 100,000 Heavenly Constitutions together, it must be unimaginably powerful, right? What does it even mean to have a Celestial Constitution?" Lord Xie asked him with a fascinated look on his face.

"Not really," Su Yang shook his head and said, "Only those with Celestial Qi in their body can take advantage of a Celestial Constitution, and since I did not have Celestial Qi in my previous life, I was unable to take advantage of my Celestial Constitution. As for what one could do with a body that contained the Celestial Constitution... legend has it that you can ascend to true godhood and take control of the universe and everything within it as you will."

"Control everything within the Universe...? Not even Heaven has such an ability!" Xie Wang exclaimed in a dumbfounded voice.

"Well, although there have been people that had managed to achieve a Celestial Constitution before me, they all perished before they could ascend to godhood, so it’s only a legend." Su Yang shrugged his shoulders.

And he continued, "Anyway, we are only a few minutes away from reaching the Eastern Continent."

Over the next few minutes, everyone on the flying ship was silently thinking to themselves what Su Yang had just told them.

’Su Yang... he is countless times more amazing than I thought...’ Wu Jingjing and Zhu Mengyi had similar thoughts.

’Just what kind of status did Su Yang hold in his previous life...?’ Lord Xie pondered.

’How did someone so amazing end up dying and coming to this world?’ Xie Wang wondered.

’Hundreds of millions of women...’ Xie Xingfang sighed inwardly.
