Chapter 677 - Well, Here I Am!

Early in the following morning, Lian Li was in her living quarter when she received news of what happened at the Nine Spring Hall last night after she left in a hurry.

"You may leave..." Lian Li said to the servant in a gloomy voice.

"Yes, Your Highness!"

Once the servant left the place, Lian Li fell onto her knees with a shocked expression on her face.

"What have I done? Because of my desire for revenge, I have not only humiliated myself but even Jiu Chun, even causing the destruction of his NIne Spring Hall! I should have never offended that man!" Lian Li deeply regretted poisoning Su Yang, but alas, there is no medicine for regret in this world.

"Once father learns of the truth— and he definitely will, I will be in even deeper trouble!" Lian Li sighed loudly.

"And what happened last night..."

Lian Li’s mind suddenly drifted to when she was affected by the poison, and she recalled begging Su Yang for more.

"Ahhhhhh! Even though I was not in the right state of mind, I cannot believe that I would actually plead him to pleasure me!" Lian Li cried loudly.

However, no matter how much she tried to forget about yesterday, the burning sensation of pleasure from last night still lingered within her body, almost as if it didn’t want to forget.

Then she recalled what she did last night after returning home— how she tried to pleasure herself only to be filled with frustration when she realized that it felt nothing like the feeling of Su Yang’s fingers and that she will not be able to satisfy herself.

"T-This is all his fault that I can no longer pleasure myself without recalling what happened that night!"

After spending many minutes contemplating what she should do from this point, Lian Li decided to follow her heart’s desires.

"Haaaa... If I don’t satisfy this itch in my heart, I won’t be able to cultivate properly anymore, and I might even go crazy." Lian Li sighed.

Sometime later, Lian Li left her living quarters and walked a few blocks before stopping in front of Wu Jingjing’s living quarters.

Taking a deep breath and releasing it a moment later, Lian Li proceeded to the doorstep before knocking on the door.

*Knock* *Knock*

Lian Li could feel her heart beating louder with each knock.

"..."

"..."

"..."

However, nobody answered the door even after many minutes, so Lian Li decided to knock again but even louder this time.

*Knock* Knock*

"..."

"..."

"..."

"What the heck? Is there nobody home today?" Lian Li shook her head, feeling dispirited that all of her preparation had been in vain.

However, just as she turned around and prepared to leave, the door suddenly opened.

Lian Li turned around to see Su Yang standing at the door, but his appearance was slightly messy and wet, and his clothes were loosened, almost as if he’d just got out of the bathtub.

"What the hell? If you were home, answer the door when it’s knocked on!" Lian Li said to him with a frown. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

"I apologize for making you wait so long, but I was busy with a few things," he said with a smile.

"Busy?" Lian Li raised her eyebrows.

It was at this moment that Lian Li decided to look down, and to her surprise, there was a massive bulge between his legs.

"Y-Y-You—!" Lian Li took a few steps back from shock after realizing what Su Yang meant by ’busy’, and her face flushed with redness.

"Why are you so surprised? Even though I could control the poison, I still had to discharge it from my body like you."

"Anyway, what are you doing here? If it’s not important, can we do this later, since I have someone waiting for me right now," he said to her a moment later.

"I...I...I..." Lian Li’s flash glowed even redder after hearing his words.

Seeing this, the smile on Su Yang’s face grew wider, and he said, "If you don’t mind waiting for a few more minutes, I’ll attend you next."

Su Yang then went back inside the house. However, he didn’t close the door and left the wide-open, seemingly signaling Lian Li to enter.

"..."

Lian Li stared at the open door with a dazed look as she pondered to herself whether she should really be doing this.

However, after standing for some time, a sharp and spine-chilling m.o.a.n echoed from inside the house and reached Lian Li’s ears.

"Aaaaaaah~!"

Upon hearing Wu Jingjing’s passionate voice, Lian Li’s body trembled, almost as though it was reacting to it.

"Aaaah~!"

"Aaaaaaaah!"

"Aaaaah~!"

Lian Li quickly began getting fidgety, and not wanting the others to hear such a vulgar noise, she closed the door but not before entering the house herself.

"Aaaa~!"

"Mmmm~!"

"Oooh~! That’s the spot, Su Yang~!"

Wu Jingjing’s voice penetrated the walls and straight into Lian Li’s heart, causing her body to heat up from l.u.s.t.

’I can’t believe I have to listen to this!’ Lian Li cried inwardly.

After enduring the passionate m.o.a.ning coming from Wu Jingjing’s room for a few minutes, the noises finally stopped.

"Are they finally done...?" Lian Li mumbled in a low voice, looking quite exhausted from trying to resist her urges to touch herself.

After waiting for a few more minutes, Su Yang appeared before her again.

"Thank you for waiting for me." Su Yang said to her with a handsome smile on her face.

"Now then, why don’t you tell me why you are here?" he then asked.

"I..." Lian Li looked at him with a nervous and bashful expression, seemingly hesitant about speaking.

"What happened to your straight and daring character from when we first met? If you had the boldness to poison me during our dinner, surely, you should be able to tell me what you want—"

"I want a continuation of what happened yesterday!" Lian Li suddenly interrupted him in a loud voice, and she continued a moment later, "You told me to return once I am in the right state of mind, right?! Well, here I am!"
