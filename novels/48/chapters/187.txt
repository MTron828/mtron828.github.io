Once he returned to his room, Su Yang said to the two girls, "I will be leaving for a bit to deal with some business. You can wait here in the meantime."

"You are leaving already? What happened to resting?" Qiuyue asked.

"I have rested enough during my stay at the Four Seasons Academy," he said.

"Where are you going?"

"To see an old friend," he responded with a smile.

"A friend...?" Qiuyue raised an eyebrow in surprise. Since when did Su Yang become the type to have friends? Then she came to the realization that the only people Su Yang would consider as his ’friends’ are all females.

"Is that so? Then I hope you have fun with your friend!" she said with a sarcastic voice.

Su Yang smiled bitterly and said, "You are clearly misunderstanding something here..."

However, seeing Qiuyue close her eyes to ignore him, Su Yang did not try to convince her and turned to look at Xiao Rong instead.

"Xiao Rong, you can do whatever you want until I return," he said to her.

Xiao Rong nodded and immediately disappeared from the room.

"Oh, right. Qiuyue, let me borrow your flying treasure. Just the wooden boat is good enough," he said to her.

Qiuyue did not even bother to open her eyes and threw her storage ring at Su Yang, telling him to find it himself.

Su Yang did not mind her behavior and retrieved the wooden boat before tossing the ring back to her.

"I shouldn’t be gone for long," he said before leaving.

The first thing he did after he left was to register Qiuyue and Xiao Rong as his ’servants’ to the administrations. This way, they won’t be considered as suspicious individuals by the Sect when he is not around. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

After registering their names, Su Yang went to accept another mission.

However, since he only accepted the last mission as an excuse to leave the Sect, Su Yang must forfeit that mission and consider it as a failed mission.

And because the mission happened to be extremely easy, the Sect Elder looked at Su Yang with an odd expression on his face after learning that he’d failed such an easy mission.

"Y-You failed this mission? Although it takes some time to complete, this mission is by no means difficult... And you are even an Inner Court disciple..."

Su Yang merely shrugged his shoulders and said, "Things happen."

The Sect Elder shook his head inwardly and accepted his other mission.

Once that was all done, Su Yang left the Profound Blossom Sect and used the flying boat he got from Qiuyue to soar in the sky.

Inside her own room, Liu Lanzhi pondered about how to ’punish’ Su Yang for breaking the Sect Rules. That being said, the real reason she wanted to punish Su Yang was so she could get back at him because she was yelled at by the Su Family for her negligence.

"That damn Su Family! In the first place, how am I supposed to do my duties as the Sect Master if I have to keep watch over that little brat at every second?! That’s unreasonable! Just because you supply my Sect with some resources doesn’t mean you can push me around!"

If the Su Family wasn’t one of the Four Great Families with prowess far greater than her Profound Blossom Sect, she wouldn’t be this frustrated.

"That being said, why did Su Yang even go to the Northern Region in the first place?" she pondered.

"And even though I said that I will punish him, what would be an appropriate punishment for someone like him?"

Because Inner Court disciples’ punishment differed from Outer Court disciples when they break the Sect Rules and Su Yang is an Inner Court disciple, she must spend some time to really think about it.

Normally, when a disciple of the Profound Blossom Sect break a sect rule, they will be prohibited from dual cultivation for a certain time, and such punishment could last from days to even months. However, since Su Yang is somewhat of a special existence in Liu Lanzhi’s heart, she couldn’t treat him like any other disciple.

After many minutes of thinking, Liu Lanzhi finally had an idea for what would be Su Yang’s punishment.

"That’s right! I can always make him do that!"

Liu Lanzhi immediately returned to Su Yang’s living quarters to give him his punishment.

Once she arrived at his living quarters, Liu Lanzhi had expected Su Yang to come out when she called for him from outside, but alas, it was Qiuyue who appeared before her.

"H-He left?" Liu Lanzhi stared at her with a dumbfounded expression after learning that Su Yang had already left.

"W-What happened to resting? It hasn’t even been an hour since I left him alone!" she thought to herself.

"Do you know where he went?" she asked Qiuyue.

Qiuyue shook her head.

"I-Is that so..."

Since Su Yang is not here, her punishment for him will have to wait until he returns.

However, Liu Lanzhi did not leave immediately and instead began speaking to Qiuyue, "You are his servant, right? How does he treat you girls? Did you come from the Northern Region?" she asked her with an inquiring face, seemingly interested in their relationship with him, especially when they appeared out of the blue.

"..."

Qiuyue looked at Liu Lanzhi with an annoyed expression. She had no intentions to play along with her and decided to put an end to this conversation.

Qiuyue suddenly waved her sleeve before Liu Lanzhi’s face, and a few seconds later, Liu Lanzhi fell to the ground with a peaceful expression, seemingly deep asleep.

And with another wave of her sleeve, Qiuyue moved the sleeping Liu Lanzhi away from the house until she was somewhere far away before she returned to her own room.

On that day, many Profound Blossom Sect disciples and Sect Elders alike were shocked and bewildered to find Liu Lanzhi, their Sect Master, sleeping in the middle of the Outer Court like some drunkard after a long night of partying.
