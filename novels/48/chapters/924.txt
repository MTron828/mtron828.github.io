Chapter 925 Their Mentors

Once Luo Ziyi left the sect, the goddesses said, "Before we show you your new living quarters, we should figure out who will be taking care of who."

"That should be easy." One of them said, and then she continued, "Which of you here mainly uses the sword?"

Lian Li then raised her hand and said, "I mainly use the sword."

"Me too." Wu Jingjing also said.

"Good. Then I will be your mentor starting today. Once again, my name is Qian Yun’er. Nice to meet you."

"We will be in your care, Sister Qian."

A moment later, another goddess stepped forward and said, "My name is Mei Lingling, and I am an expert with medicine and pills. Junior Sister Liqing, Junior Sister Mengyi, I can smell the aroma of medicine on you two. Want to follow me?"

Zhu Mengyi and Su Liqing nodded their heads.

"By the way, I’m curious, why aren’t you following the other two to meet the God of Alchemy? She’s definitely much better when it comes to medicine." Mei Lingling asked them.

"Well... I study medicine, but it’s not really my main path. I am actually a dual cultivator... And I don’t know how to concoct pills." Su Liqing said.

"I see... That’s fine. Even if you aren’t an alchemy master, I can still teach you. And to tell you the truth, none of us are actually dual cultivators. We only started dual cultivation because of Su Yang. However, we can still teach you about dual cultivation with our experience."

Zhu Mengyi then said, "I wanted to study under the God of Alchemy at one point, but after giving birth to Zhu Jiayi, I decided to give up and focus on taking care of her."

"Maybe in the future, once Zhu Jiayi is all grown up and more dependent, I will seek the God of Alchemy for tutelage."

"That’s a respectable choice as well. I may not be as good as the God of Alchemy when it comes to medicine, but I am still one of the top Alchemy Masters in the Four Divine Heavens. I will prepare you for the day you decide to study under the God of Alchemy."

"Okay. Thank you, Senior Sister Mei."

A moment later, another goddess stepped forward.

"Any normal cultivators amongst your group? I’m Yu Ning. I don’t really specialize in anything besides cultivation."

Hearing her words, Su Yin, Zhang Xiu Ying, Fang Xiaoru, and Xie Xingfang stepped forward.

"Great. Then you’ll be in my care. I will do my best to help you all become powerful cultivators."

"Please take care of us, Senior Sister Yu." They bowed to her.

"My name is Xing Aiying, and I am a master of formations and illusions. Does anyone here want to learn formations?"

Li Xiao Mo quickly stepped forward and bowed to her, "I would like to study under you, Senior Sister Xing."

"Okay."

"I have the most experience when it comes to dual cultivation among us sisters. Who are dual cultivators here? My name is Ji Xiaofan."

Sun Jingjing, Fang Zhelan, and Qi Yue stepped forward.

"You’re also a dual cultivator?" Ji Xiaofan looked at Qi Yue with raised eyebrows, as she looked too young to be one.

"I haven’t experienced dual cultivation yet, but I have been studying it ever since I was young. I also intend on becoming a dual cultivator," Qi Yue said.

"Alright. I will teach you every dual cultivation technique that a woman must know, especially if you wish to satisfy Su Yang. He’s not easily satisfied, after all." Ji Xiaofan smiled.

"Of course, if the others want to learn them as well, you’re free to study with us as well."

By now, only four people were left that didn’t have anyone assigned to them.

Yan Yan, Hong Yu’er, Qiuyue, and Qin Liangyu.

A moment later, someone stepped forward and looked at Qin Liangyu and asked her, "Are you interested in Body Refining? I can tell from your physique that you have trained your body before."

Qin Liangyu nodded and said, "I used to train my body when I was still in my tribe since we’re required to hunt spiritual beasts to survive, and we didn’t really have any proper cultivation techniques."

"Then would you like to study under me? I can make your body reflect to even powerful treasures but also keep its softness and slender figure, but it won’t be easy."

"I will be in your care, Senior Sister." Qin Liangyu nodded. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

"Jia Jinghua is my name," she said afterward.

Now it was just Hong Yu’er, Qiuyue, and Yan Yan left.

"I am planning to serve under Sister Tang in the future," Hong Yu’er suddenly said to them.

"Sister Lingxi? You want to serve her?" The goddesses were surprised to hear this.

They thought she was one of Su Yang’s women this entire time.

Hong Yu’er nodded.

"Oh, you must be the one that occupied Sister Lingxi’s soul." Wang Yunxuan said.

"Want to study under me in the meantime? I’m the most familiar with Sister Lingxi out of everyone here, so I can teach you everything I know about her."

Hong Yu’er quickly nodded her head.

"I’m Wang Yunxuan."

"Hong Yu’er."

Sometime later—

"I have been wondering this for a while now, but isn’t the spiritual energy around her weird?" Someone there suddenly said while pointing at Yan Yan.

"Yes, I have also been thinking about that for a while now," said another person.

Su Liqing then said, "She has a special talent that allows her to communicate with the Profound Qi around her— at least in our previous world. I think Su Yang called her ’Heaven’s Favorite’ before."

"What?! Heaven’s Favorite?!" The goddesses were shocked when they heard this term, and they all stared at Yan Yan with great interest.

"Young lady, can you communicate with the Profound Qi in this world?" Wang Yunxuan asked her a moment later in a somewhat nervous voice.

Yan Yan looked around for a moment before nodding her head, "Yes, they have been trying to communicate with me ever since I came outside."

"Heavens..." Wang Yunxuan and the others mumbled in a low voice after hearing her words, seemingly speechless.
