Chapter 824 - Qiuyue

After spending a few more days with Xie Xingfang to make sure there were no problems with the delivery, Su Yang prepared to return to the Profound Blossom Sect with the others.

"Wait a second, Su Yang." Lord Xie stopped him at the front door.

He then handed him a bag of storage rings and said, "Everything you’ve asked for is in here."

Su Yang nodded, "Thank you. I will send the pills to you after I’m done with it in a few days."

"Take your time, Su Yang. One more thing. Regarding the celebration, when do you want to do it?" Lord Xie asked him.

"Whenever you want. However, preferably after my breakthrough to the Sovereign Spirit Realm." Su Yang replied.

"I understand. I’ll ask you again after that then."

"If anything happens, you know how to contact me."

Sometime later, Su Yang and the other ladies returned to the Profound Blossom Sect.

Once they returned, the ladies went back to their daily lives.

"I’ll meet you in your room later tonight." Su Yang said to Qiuyue before she went to her room with a flushed face.

"How did the delivery go?" Liu Lanzhi asked Su Yang.

"The babies came out without any problems, and Xie Xingfang herself is perfectly healthy as well."

"That’s great news." Liu Lanzhi nodded.

"By the way, cancel all of my plans and appointments for the entire week. I’ll be busy."

"Okay." Liu Lanzhi nodded without questioning him.

After leaving Liu Lanzhi’s room, Su Yang went to the Blossom Spring and submerged himself in the cool water, sitting in the lotus position in the center of the spring.

He remained like this for many hours until the sky turned dark.

"It’s time, huh..."

Su Yang opened his eyes that flickered with a resolute light.

After drying his body and putting his clothes back on, Su Yang made his way back to the Profound Blossom Sect whilst basking himself in the moonlight.

Sometime later, Su Yang returned to the Yin Yan Pavilion, and he headed straight to Qiuyue’s room.

Knock. Knock.

"It’s me." Su Yang gently knocked on the door.

Meanwhile, inside the room, Qiuyue could feel her heart throbbing crazily like war drums after hearing the door knocks.

"G-Give me a moment!" Qiuyue said as she paced around the room in a panicked manner.

’Did I rush this too quickly?! My heart is not ready for this! Maybe we should do this in the future!’

Qiuyue began having second thoughts, especially when she imagined Su Yang behind her with his sword poking at her back entrance.

However, as she walked her 3rd circle around the room, the door suddenly opened, and Su Yang entered her room, dumbfounding her.

"Y-You..." Qiuyue was speechless.

"If I didn’t do this, you would’ve run away again, and I am not going to let you run away— not anymore." Su Yang said to her as he closed the door.

Qiuyue swallowed nervously upon seeing Su Yang’s serious face. She didn’t think he could be this aggressive. However, now that she thinks about it, there was no way a playboy like Su Yang would not know how to be aggressive.

"I-I don’t think I’m ready for this!" Qiuyue said.

However, almost as though he couldn’t hear it, Su Yang continued approaching her.

And before Qiuyue could run away, Su Yang hugged her waist, before kissing her on her soft lips.

"Mmm..."

Almost as though Su Yang’s kiss has a mysterious power to it, the moment their lips connected, Qiuyue’s nervousness and thoughts vanished without a trace.

"Mmm~"

The two of them kissed and kissed for many minutes, slowly making their way towards the bed— or more specifically, Su Yang led Qiuyue to the bed.

Once they were by the bed, Su Yang gently laid Qiuyue’s body on the bed before separating their lips and staring at her glistening eyes.

"Su Yang..." Qiuyue stared back into his eyes.

"Qiuyue, let’s do it." Su Yang said to her in a gentle voice.

"..."

After a moment of silence, Qiuyue nodded in a bashful manner, and even though the place was somewhat dark, Su Yang could see the rosy color on her smooth cheeks clearly.

Once Qiuyue nodded her head in approval, Su Yang began removing her clothes, spreading it over the bed.

"You have a beautiful body, Qiuyue." Su Yang said to her with a smile on his face as he admired her jadelike skin that was pale and pure like snow on the peak of the mountain that has never been conquered.

"S-Save your flattering, Su Yang..." she mumbled with her head turned sideways, as she was too embarrassed to look at Su Yang at this moment.

Su Yang suddenly reached for her snowy peaks with his hands, firmly grasping them.

"It’s a perfect fit." Su Yang chuckled.

"..."

Qiuyue remained silent, yet her face was clearly growing more reddish.

After massaging them for a few seconds, Su Yang moved his mouth towards the pink tip at the center of these peaks and began sucking them like a baby.

"Mmm~!"

Qiuyue gritted her teeth to resist m.o.a.ning out loud.

"Mmmm!"

Qiuyue nearly gave up when she felt Su Yang teasing her n.i.p.p.l.e by circling around it with his tongue.

After teasing her b.r.e.a.s.ts for a few minutes, Su Yang slowly made his way towards the bottom, kissing her soft skin every few inches as he approached the treasure between her legs. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

A few moments later, Su Yang’s face was directly between Qiuyue’s spotless closed slit.

Taking a deep breath, Su Yang extended his tongue and began licking the entrance to her cave.

"Mmmmm!" Qiuyue’s body trembled with delight.

Once her closed slit began drooling with Yin Qi, Su Yang used his hands to spread open her cave, revealing the wet and pink meat inside, and without any hesitation, he pressed his mouth on it, kissing it passionately.

"Aaaah~!"

Qiuyue could no longer resist her voice and released a loud m.o.a.n that echoed in the room.

Luckily for her, Su Yang already created a formation that prevented noises from leaving this room despite the open window.
