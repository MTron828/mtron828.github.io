Chapter 967 Help Me Climax!

"Mmmm~!"

"Aaaahhh~!"

Feng Tianwei moaned without restraint a few minutes into the shoulder massage, feeling tingly all over her body.

After a few more minutes, she suddenly turned around and grabbed Su Yang by his wrist.

"Is there something wrong?" Su Yang remained calm and asked her.

"I have changed my mind. If you want to buy my phoenixes, you will have to make me climax," she said while staring at him with a narrowed gaze, her eyes filled with lust.

Su Yang raised his eyebrows upon hearing this, and he spoke, "How do I know that you’ll keep your words this time and won’t try to change it again?"

"You don’t," she quickly responded.

"Fair enough." Su Yang said with a mysterious smile on his face.

"Let’s go somewhere more comfortable." Feng Yuxiang stood up and walked to the door, but her movements were a little sluggish.

Feng Tianwei acted like she didn’t notice it and escorted Su Yang to her bedroom.

Once they were inside the luxurious bedroom, Feng Tianwei sat on her red bed and said, "So how will you make me climax? I’ll let you know that nobody has been able to make me climax for the past 200 years."

"I will be giving you a massage, of course. It’s what I do," he said in a calm voice.

Feng Tianwei sneered, "If you think you can make me climax with just your hands, you’re vastly overestimating yourself. Although your shoulder massage felt great, it wasn’t enough to satisfy me."

"We won’t know until we try."

Feng Tianwei no longer said anything else and removed her clothes, showing Su Yang her beautiful body that had phoenix art engraved onto her entire back.

A few moments later, Su Yang approached the bed and started massaging her back, slowly working around her body, but he purposefully avoided Feng Tianwei’s sensitive areas.

Of course, Feng Tianwei would moan quite often throughout the massage, but her body was actually nowhere near reaching the climax point.

"Is this all you got? If so, you won’t be able to buy your beloved at this rate." Feng Tianwei said to him a few minutes into the massage when Su Yang was just casually caressing her back.

"I am just getting started."

After saying those words, Su Yang suddenly pressed his fingers into her body, pressing all ten of her vital spots at once.

"Aaaaah~!"

Feng Tianwei released a sharp moan, and her lower body began drooling with Yin Qi.

With a single movement, Su Yang had managed to stimulate Feng Tianwei’s body from zero to a hundred.

If Feng Tianwei hadn’t resisted her urges at the last second, she would’ve climaxed on the spot.

’W-What was that just now?! What kind of technique did he just use?!’ Feng Tianwei cried inwardly as Su Yang kept his fingers pressing on her vital spots, keeping her body on the verge of climaxing.

Su Yang kept his fingers pressed on Feng Tianwei’s body for ten whole seconds. Luckily for Feng Tianwei, Su Yang removed his fingers after ten seconds, or she would’ve climaxed if he was even a second late.

Of course, Su Yang was aware of this, but he didn’t want to defeat Feng Tianwei so easily, barely letting her endure it.

"I am finished with your back. Can you turn around now so that I can work the front?" Su Yang asked her.

However, Feng Tianwei remained faced-down for another minute before she eventually turned around with a weird look on her face.

Su Yang acted like he didn’t notice it and started massaging her front body, and once again, he purposefully avoided her sensitive areas so that she could rest.

This time, Feng Tianwei didn’t utter a single word and allowed Su Yang to do his thing.

Many minutes later, Su Yang slowly caressed her body until his hands were slightly below her belly.

Then, without any warnings, Su Yang suddenly pressed his fingers into her skin again, immediately sending waves of pleasure throughout Feng Tianwei’s body.

Feng Tianwei’s body trembled in response, and her lower lips leaked a lot more Yin Qi than previously.

Su Yang acted like he didn’t notice it and continued to tease Feng Tianwei’s body, keeping her body on the verge of climaxing.

Of course, if Feng Tianwei wasn’t so stubborn, she would’ve already climaxed when Su Yang used his technique for the first time. But since she threw away that chance just to defeat him, she unknowingly screwed herself over.

Now Su Yang was in complete control, meaning if he didn’t want Feng Tianwei to climax, she would not climax no matter how much wants to.

Thus, Su Yang proceeded to spend the next fifteen minutes just teasing Feng Tianwei’s body until she was able to climax, but he would suddenly stop before she could actually climax and return to casually massaging her body.

Feng Tianwei eventually realized that Su Yang was playing with her, so she exploded with anger, "Are you messing with me?!"

"What do you mean?" Su Yang asked her, feigning ignorance.

"You could’ve made me climax multiple times now, but you would suddenly stop whenever I am on the verge of climaxing! You’re definitely doing this on purpose! You dare mess with me, Feng Tianwei?! I definitely won’t sell my girl to you now!"

Hearing her words, Su Yang stopped his movements entirely, and he said, "I understand."

He then got off the bed and started making his way towards the exit, leaving Feng Tianwei speechless.

"W-Where do you think you are going?!" She called out to him.

"Hmm? I am leaving. If you’re not going to sell her to me, I have no reason to be here." Su Yang said in a calm voice.

Feng Tianwei gritted her teeth in anger, yet she didn’t dare to say anything rude.

After 200 years, she has finally managed to find someone who could make her climax, and her body was screaming for satisfaction due to Su Yang’s constant teasing, so she couldn’t afford to make Su Yang leave now, or she will remain sexually frustrated for heaven-knows-how-long.

"Come back! If you help me climax, I will sell her to you— No! I will give her to you for free! I swear to the heavens!" Feng Tianwei swore a moment later.

"Good enough." Su Yang nodded after hearing her words, and he returned to the bed.

Once he was beside her body again, Su Yang went straight for the slit between her legs and began massaging it. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

"Ooooh~!"

Feng Tianwei’s body quickly experienced a massive tremor, and she could feel her body skyrocketing to the climax once again.

Su Yang didn’t stop this time and continued to massage her slit and its pink pearl, even sticking a few of his fingers inside the cave to stimulate her body further.

A few seconds later—

"Aaaaah~!"

Feng Tianwei’s body jumped uncontrollably as her lower cave gushed with Yin Qi that sprayed all over the bed and floor, even reaching the wall many meters away.

Su Yang didn’t say anything and allowed Feng Tianwei to rest on the bed until she could finally think properly again.

Many minutes later, Feng Tianwei asked him, "What would it take for me to experience climax using the thing between your legs? Don’t worry, I will keep my promise and give you that woman you’re so interested in even if you don’t agree."

Su Yang remained silent for a second before speaking, "If you visit me at the Heavenly Massage as a client and ask me then, I will think about it."

"..."

Feng Tianwei didn’t say anything after that.

Once she was able to move her body again, she retrieved a scroll and said to him, "Her name was Mei Ying, right? Show this scroll to the manager working at that place, then you can take that woman with you."

Su Yang accepted the scroll.

"Thanks," he said to her before walking towards the exit.

"Xiao Yang... Who are you, really?" she asked him right as he reached the door.

Su Yang turned around and said with a calm smile on his face, "I am only a failed scholar who decided to open up a massage parlor in this place."

Once Su Yang left the place, Feng Tianwei mumbled in a low voice as her gaze remained on the exit, "Mei Ying... What a lucky woman to receive his attention..."

Sometime later, Feng Tianwei called Third Phoenix to her room.

"Did you learn anything about the Heavenly Massage and that masseur?"

Third Phoenix nodded and began telling Feng Tianwei everything she discovered about Xiao Yang and his massage parlor, but most of it was information given to her by his customers.

"Is that so..." Feng Tianwei mumbled as she laid on the bed and stared at the ceiling with a dazed look on her face.

"Is everything okay?" Third Phoenix asked her.

"I have a feeling that the City of Pleasure will have a new powerhouse in the near future," she responded in a low voice.

"Excuse me?" Third Phoenix raised her eyebrows.

"Cancel all of my appointments for the rest of the day and tomorrow, then reschedule it for another day." Feng Tianwei then said, and she continued, "I am going to sleep, so don’t disturb me unless it’s an absolute emergency."

"I-I understand. Rest well." Third Phoenix bowed to her before leaving her alone.

Once she was alone, Feng Tianwei closed her eyes and quickly fell asleep on her large bed that was still soaked in her Yin Qi.

When she woke up the following day, Feng Tianwei changed her clothes and left the Scarlet Phoenixes, making her way to the Pink Light District.
