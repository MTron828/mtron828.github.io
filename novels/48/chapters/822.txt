Chapter 823 - After Delivery

After the first delivery, Su Yang helped Xie Xingfang with the second delivery, and in just a few minutes, the baby boy was pushed out successfully as well.

Once the umbilical cord was cut, Su Yang wrapped the baby boy in a towel before handing him to Xie Xingfang too.

"Waaaah! Waaaah! Waaaaaaah!"

The room was filled with crying noises from the newborn, and it didn’t stop until many minutes later.

"I-Is is finished?" Sun Jingjing asked afterward.

"Yes, it’s done." Su Yang nodded, and he could feel his hands quivering slightly, as this was his first time delivering his own children.

Sometime later, after Su Yang cleaned up the place, the others gathered around Xie Xingfang to look at the babies.

"Wow... They’re so... tiny..." Sun Jingjing mumbled.

"What did you expect? They’re newborns..." Wu Jingjing chuckled.

"They are babies...?" Xiao Rong stared at the two babies in Xie Xingfang’s arms with a dazed look on her face, almost like she couldn’t believe that they’d been in Xie Xingfang’s stomach this entire time.

"Do you have a name for them yet?" Zhu Mengyi asked.

Xie Xingfang nodded and said, "I’ve decided that they’ll follow Su Yang’s family name, so they’ll be Su Yuying and Su Tianying. The girl will be Yuying, and the boy will be Tianying."

"Su Yuying and Su Tianying, huh? What cute names." Lian Li said with a smile on her face.

"Here, Su Yang. You should hold them too." Xie Xingfang looked at Su Yang with a loving gaze.

Su Yang nodded and carried the twins— one on each arm.

"Congratulations, Su Yang, Sister Xingfang." Su Liqing congratulated them sometime later.

"Congratulations, Su Yang, Sister Xing’er."

The others followed.

"Thank you all..." Xie Xingfang said.

"Oh, right, I almost forgot. Xiao Rong, can you get the other two?" Su Yang turned to look at her. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Xiao Rong nodded before disappearing from the room and reappearing a minute later.

A few minutes later, both Lord Xie and Xie Wang came rushing into the room at the same time.

"Is it true?! Xing’er already gave birth?!" Lord Xie entered the room in a hurry.

"Quiet down, father. What if you scare the babies with your loud voice?" Xie Xingfang glared at him with a slight frown on her face.

"Oh, right... I’m sorry." Lord Xie immediately lowered his voice.

"Heavens... I didn’t think I’d see this day so soon..." Xie Wang wiped the tears in his eyes when he saw the twins in Su Yang’s arms.

"C-Can I hold them?" Xie Wang asked.

Su Yang nodded and handed the twins to Xie Wang.

"Ahh... This reminds me of the day you and Xing’er were born." Xie Wang mumbled, feeling nostalgic.

After carrying the twins for a few minutes, Xie Wang handed the twins to Lord Xie who had a large smile on his face at this moment.

"Indeed, this reminds me of the day Xing’er was born..." he said, seeing the image of his late wife behind Xie Xingfang.

"What are their names?" Lord Xie asked.

"The boy is Su Tianying and the girl is Su Yuying." Xie Xingfang said.

"So you gave them Su Yang’s family name, huh? I guess that’s to be expected." A bittersweet smile appeared on Lord Xie’s face as he handed the twins back to Su Yang.

After a moment of silence, Xie Xingfang suddenly said, "Father... This may be sudden, but since I’ll be leaving this world with Su Yang, I have decided to leave Su Tianying here with you."

"W-What? Why on earth would you do that?" Lord Xie looked at her with a gawking expression on his face, as he truly didn’t expect such an outcome.

Xie Xingfang proceeded to give an explanation for her decision, leaving Lord Xie even more speechless.

However, to Xie Xingfang and Su Yang’s surprise, Lord Xie shook his head and said, "While I understand your reasons for doing this, and I am truly grateful for it, I cannot separate you and your son merely because of my own selfish desires. You don’t need to leave him behind just so he can succeed me."

"But what about the family? Who will continue the family’s legacy? Don’t tell me you’re planning on ending it with you, right?" Xie Xingfang quickly asked him.

"Of course not." Lord Xie laughed, and he said, "This may come as a surprise to you, especially since I’d said that I won’t marry another woman after your mother, but I have decided to find another woman, so the family will go on even if you leave with Su Yang and all of your children."

It was Xie Xingfang’s time to be left speechless after Lord Xie’s words.

"Y-You’re going to marry another woman? When?" Xie Xingfang couldn’t help but ask.

However, Lord Xie merely shrugged and said, "Who knows. Whenever I find the right woman, I guess."

"Anyways, we can talk about my situation later. Right now, just enjoy this moment. We’ll have a proper celebration later." Lord Xie said.

Thus, the Su Family and the Xie Family continued to look at the newborn twins.

Sometime later, once everybody in the room had a chance to carry the twins, Su Yang said, "Okay, let’s Xing’er some time to rest now. She just gave birth, after all."

A few moments later, everyone returned to their own rooms whilst Su Yang remained to keep an eye on Xie Xingfang and the babies.

Time passed quickly, and in what felt like a blink of their eyes, a week has passed since Xie Xingfang’s delivery.

"How are the twins?" Su Yang asked Xie Xingfang after entering her room.

"They’re perfect." Xie Xingfang responded with a smile with the twins sleeping peacefully in her arms.

"Let me check your body."

After taking a moment to examine her pulses, Su Yang checked her entrance down there that had been stretched extensively from giving birth.

"It’s recovering as expected and should be back to normal in just a few more days." Su Yang said afterward.

"Thank you, Su Yang."

Su Yang merely smiled, and he proceeded to sit on the bed beside her for the next few hours looking at the twins.
