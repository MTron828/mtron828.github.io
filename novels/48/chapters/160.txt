Patriarch Wu looked at the communication talisman in his grasp with an irritated expression.

"Again? Do I look like a babysitter?! This is the last time! The next time you’d better be here yourself to pick her up!" he yelled at the talisman before heading to the same place as usual.

Inside Wu Jinjing’s living quarters, the two girls continued to talk about girl things.

"It’s still a bit early but what should I name the child? Will it be a girl or a boy? What do you think, Sister Mengyi?" Wu Jinjing wondered out loud and asked her for advice.

Zhu Mengyi looked at her with an unbelieving expression, and she said in a low voice, "Why are you asking me that? First of all, how are you so sure that you’ll be pregnant? Didn’t you do it only once? I’m not experienced in this field but I have heard that it’s much harder for Cultivators to get pregnant than mortals, especially those with a higher Cultivation base."

"It’ll be fine," Wu Jinjing spoke in a confident voice. "It will all work out, I’m sure of it."

"She’s really gone crazy..." Zhu Mengyi was already harboring hate towards this man who had turned her best friend into such a state, wondering if he had brainwashed her or something of sorts.

"Sister Mengyi, have you had any thoughts of finding a partner anytime soon?" Wu Jinjing’s question caught her off guard.

"Of course not! I have already dedicated my life to the Dao of Alchemy! There’s no man out there that could possibly make my determination waver!"

"That’s what I thought at first, but that was before I met him." Wu Jinjing smiled, "One day, just like me, you will meet someone that will turn your entire view of this world upside-down, and you will lose your reasoning to his charm!"

"Don’t count on it!"

"It may not be anytime soon, but one day, for sure..."

"Enough about me! I came here to talk about you! Does your father know any of this?" Zhu Mengyi tried to change the topic and asked.

The smile on Wu Jinjing’s face turned bitter. "I haven’t told him yet."

Zhu Mengyi looked at her with a baffled expression. "You haven’t told him yet?! I don’t think you should keep such a big secret from him."

She shook her head and said, "I’m not really trying to keep this a secret. I just haven’t had the time to speak with him yet. Have you heard of the Ghost Girl?"

"The supposedly invincible entity that is currently striking fear into the hearts of everyone?"

"Un. Although he doesn’t show it, his complexion has paled since the meeting. He’s clearly worried despite telling us to not worry about it."

"Aren’t you worried?" Zhu Mengyi asked her. "This Ghost Girls seems to have unfounded prowess that nobody can defend against. What if it attacks one of our places?"

"...I won’t say that I’m not worried, but there’s really no point in worrying about something like this when even my father is clueless."

"I guess you are right—"

Suddenly, a loud voice appeared out of the blue and echoed within Wu Jinjing’s room.

"I know you are in there, Prime Disciple of the Four Seasons Academy." It was Patriarch Wu’s voice that resounded in the room.

Wu Jinjing looked at her with a bitter smile and said, "This may be the fastest one yet, huh."

"Why can’t my mother just leave me alone? I am already a Prime Disciple for heaven sakes!"

"I’m coming inside."

Once Patriarch Wu entered the room, he looked at Zhu Mengyi and said, "I know telling you to stop coming is akin to telling babies to stop peeing themselves, but at least let your mother know before you leave. She sounded fairly angry this time around."

"I will see you next time, Sister Mengyi."

"Un! I will come back as soon as possible! We are not done talking with ’that’ topic yet! There’s still plenty of questions I have on my mind!"

Zhu Mengyi quickly greeted Patriarch Wu, almost like one would when in someone else’s house, before returning to the Four Seasons Academy.

Once Zhu Mengyi left, Patriarch Wu continued, "You are not completely out of this. She listens to you the most, so you need to stop giving her trouble."

"Anyway, I have to go back and—"

"Father, wait." Wu Jinjing stopped him from leaving. "There is something I want to tell you."

"What is it? Make it quick."

"It’s very important..."

Patriarch Wu looked at her serious expression and sighed. He then grabbed a chair and sat before her. "Go ahead, I’m all ears."

Wu Jinjing took a deep breath before opening her mouth to speak.

Once Zhu Mengyi returned to the Four Seasons Academy, she went directly to the Matriarch’s living quarters to find Matriarch Zhu.

"Mother! I am no longer a child! Why won’t you leave me alone? You even said that you will no longer bother me if I become the Prime Disciple! I was having an important discussion with Sister Jinjing!" she complained to her the moment she saw her.

Matriarch Zhu looked at her unhappy daughter and spoke in a calm voice, "I did indeed say such words, and that’s why I overlooked your past few visits to that place. However, today is different. I have important matters to speak to you about."

Seeing the serious expression on her face, Zhu Mengyi no longer felt as displeased and said, "Is this about the Ghost Girl that’s been terrorizing the world?"

"No, this is much more important than that."

"..." Zhu Mengyi was surprised to hear such words. Something even more important than the Ghost Girl? What could possibly be more important than an entity that could potentially destroy the world?

"There’s someone I want you to meet. A young man to be exact."

"..."

"..."

"Say that again? What did you just say?" Zhu Mengyi stared at her with wide eyes filled with disbelief.
