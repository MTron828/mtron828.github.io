"Bring Su Yang here!" Senior Zeng said to the guard after pondering for a minute.

"Yes!"

The guard then scurried to the guest house Su Yang was staying in and began leading Su Yang towards the Sect Master’s quarters.

Meanwhile, when the disciples in the Divine Nature Sect noticed Su Yang’s presence, they all began whispering to each other about his reason for being there.

Sometime later, Su Yang arrived at Senior Zeng’s room.

"Please, have a seat, Su Yang. I have already prepared some tea for you." Senior Zeng gestured to the chair with a friendly smile.

"..."

A mysterious smile appeared on Su Yang’s face as he sat down.

’So he doesn’t recognize me, huh? Well, that’s to be expected since this is his first time seeing me in this appearance.’

Su Yang didn’t blame Senior Zeng for not realizing that he was the Alchemy Master, but that didn’t mean he won’t have fun with this situation.

A few moments later, Senior Zeng sat down across from him and spoke, "So, what business does the Sect Master of the Profound Blossom Sect have with our Divine Nature Garden? But before you answer that, allow me to offer my congratulations to the Profound Blossom Sect for forming an alliance with the Xie Family, setting a precedent for the first time in history."

Su Yang sipped on the hot tea a few times before speaking, "Thank you. As for why I am here today... you should already know."

"..."

Senior Zeng looked at him with wide eyes. However, he pretended to be ignorant and said, "I’m sorry, but I really have no idea why you are here today... After all, our Divine Nature Garden has never communicated or dealt with the Profound Blossom Sect before. Furthermore, it wouldn’t make sense if you are here for business since you already have the Burning Lotus Sect, which is currently the number one pill sect in the Eastern Continent due to the Earth Advancement Pills alongside the other pills that can only be obtained from them. I cannot imagine why you would need our help."

"Is that so?" Su Yang kept a nonchalant expression on his face so Senior Zeng was unable to read his expression.

"By the way, where is Luo Yixiao? I’m pretty sure I asked for her presence, too." Su Yang suddenly said.

"Uhh..."

Senior Zeng began sweating after hearing his words, and he said, "I apologize, but my disciple isn’t in the sect right now."

"Oh? Where did she go?" Su Yang asked with an intrigued expression on his handsome face.

"She... uh... she left the sect not long ago to gather some herbs and ingredients for a new pill that we’re concocting." Senior Zeng said, clearly not a good liar by the way his voice trembled.

Seeing this, Su Yang chuckled inwardly before speaking, "That’s fine. I can wait."

"Are you sure? Even I don’t know when she’ll return. It could be weeks, even months, as that’s how long medicine runs usually takes." Senior Zeng continued making stuff up, hoping that it would be enough to fool Su Yang.

"Wow, it takes that long for a medicine run? The pill you’re concocting must be a very powerful one." Su Yang decided to follow the flow and act as though he knew nothing about alchemy.

"That’s right. Even the most simple pills can take days, but this one... this new pill we’re concocting is extremely complex and profound, and the ingredients required to concoct it are extremely rare, hence why it is taking so much longer." Senior Zeng spoke with a smile on his face after thinking that he’d managed to fool Su Yang.

"It must be difficult being an Alchemy Master. I cannot imagine sitting still all day just to concoct a single pill. After all, if you didn’t know, I am a Dual Cultivator who likes to move around— especially in the bedroom," Su Yang spoke with a smile on his face.

Senior Zeng’s face stiffened after hearing Su Yang’s words, and he cried inwardly, ’I definitely cannot let this damn pervert meet my disciple! He’ll sully her pure body!’

"Anyway, I apologize for this inconvenience. Even though you came all the way here from the Profound Blossom Sect, my disciple isn’t available. If there’s anything else you need, perhaps I can be of help." Senior Zeng said to him.

Even if Su Yang asked for another disciple, he wouldn’t mind as much, as long as it wasn’t Luo Yixiao.

"Well, it can’t be helped if Luo Yixiao isn’t here. I really wanted to meet her, especially after all of the good things I have heard about her." Su Yang sighed out loud, sounding like an arrogant young master who had his excitement crushed.

"..."

A weird expression appeared on Senior Zeng’s face after hearing Su Yang’s bold words. If it weren’t for Su Yang’s status, he would have already begun throwing fists at Su Yang.

"Since she’s not here today, can you let me know when she returns? I’ll return here as soon as possible when that happens. I’m also sure that Luo Yixiao would like to see me."

"Yes... of course..." Senior Zeng forced a smile on his face and nodded.

"Then I shall see you next time."

Su Yang stood up and began walking towards the exit.

However, when he reached halfway to the exit, the door opened, and a very pretty young lady walked into the room.

When Senior Zeng saw his disciple’s pretty face in the room, his eyes widened with shock, "W-What are you doing here, Yixiao?! I specifically told you to stay in your room and do not come out!" Senior Zeng cried out loud, accidentally revealing the truth to Su Yang.

Su Yang turned around and spoke with a profound expression on his face, "Hoh? So you purposefully hid her from me, even lying straight to my face? What is the meaning of this, Senior Zeng?"

"Uhh... about that...’’ Senior Zeng was speechless. How is he going to talk his way out of this predicament?!
