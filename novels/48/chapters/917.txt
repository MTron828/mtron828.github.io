Chapter 918 - Su Yang's Plans

After Xie Xingfang handed Su Tianying over to Luo Ziyi, Luo Ziyi proceeded to carry the baby in her arms with an inexplicable feeling in her heart.

Su Tianying, Su Yang’s son, stared at Luo Ziyi in silence as she carried him.​​Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Sometime later, Su Yang said, "Ziyi, I need you to do me a favor."

"What is it?"

"Can you take care of them while I am away?"

Luo Ziyi turned to look at him and said, "What do you mean?"

"I want you to let them stay at your sect for now. I will be traversing the Four Divine Heavens to improve my cultivation, and it would be inappropriate for me to carry them around with me everywhere, especially with my plans."

"If I die... I don’t want them to die with me."

Everybody there looked at him in silence.

"Don’t say such obnoxious things. I won’t forgive you if you ’die’ again." Luo Ziyi said with a frown on her face.

"I know, but I will be able to travel with reassurance knowing that they’re in your care."

After a moment of silence, Luo Ziyi turned to look at the ladies and asked them, "Are you girls okay with his decision?"

The ladies exchanged glances with each other.

Lian Li then said, "Just make sure to visit us once in a while, okay?"

"That’s right! At least once a year!" Su Yin said.

Su Yang showed a bitter smile on his face, and he said, "Unfortunately, I may not be able to visit any of you for at least a few years."

"What? Why not?" Su Liqing quickly asked.

"Because the place you ladies will be going to is called the Sacred Lands— it’s a special place in the Celestial Heaven where men are barred from entering unless they receive permission from the Sacred Empress."

"Although I have permission to enter the Sacred Land, that permission is for ’Su Yang’, and I cannot reveal my identity for now, as that would only bring trouble for everyone."

The ladies were clearly not happy to learn that they’ll have to separate from him and most likely not see him again for a few years, but they understood that Su Yang had many important things to do, and they were warned even before they arrived at the Four Divine Heavens that things will change.

"Stay safe, Su Yang." They said to him afterward.

Su Yang nodded and said, "Of course. I won’t die so easily."

And he continued while looking at Wang Shuren and Bai Lihua, "I will try my best to meet with the God of Alchemy, and when I do, I will let her know about you two. Until then, just stay with the others."

"Okay." They nodded.

"And since it might be a while until we will meet again, allow me to spend the rest of the month with you all. Do you mind, Ziyi?" Su Yang asked her.

She shook her head and said, "I was supposed to have a meeting with the Sacred Empress, but I skipped it, so I have plenty of time now."

Thus, Su Yang proceeded to spend the rest of the month cultivating with everyone inside the Immortal’s Treasury without any breaks— at least with those who are able to cultivate.

A month later, Su Yang said his goodbyes with the ladies inside the Immortal’s Treasury before leaving the place and returning to the surface in the Frozen Azure Cave with Xiao Rong and Luo Ziyi.

Of course, before they left, Su Yang handed the spatial device’s authority to Luo Ziyi so that she could carry it with her back to the Sacred Lands.

"You have some really lovely girls in there, Su Yang. I’m sure the others will also welcome their new sisters." Luo Ziyi said to him once outside, as she had plenty of opportunities to speak with the new family members during their month of entertainment.

After taking the spatial device with her, Luo Ziyi asked him, "Well, what are your plans now?"

Su Yang smiled and said, "I am going to Martial Heaven to join the Boundless Yin Yang Sect so that I can improve my cultivation."

"The Boundless Yin Yang Sect?" Luo Ziyi raised her eyebrows.

Although it wasn’t shocking and quite reasonable considering his situation, it was definitely surprising, as she never expected to see Su Yang become a disciple again.

"Are you going to go in your other appearance? The Boundless Yin Yang Sect will chase you away before you can even enter their sect gates." Luo Ziyi said to him.

Su Yang laughed out loud and said, "Ziyi, you dare underestimate me? But you’re right. As much as I want to challenge myself by cultivating in the Boundless Yin Yang Sect in that appearance, I don’t have the luxury to play around. I will go with a new appearance— one that isn’t as obnoxious."

"However, before I go to the Martial Heavens..."

He paused to clear this throat before continuing, "I will need some more help from you."

Luo Ziyi smiled and said, "How much do you need?"

"In fact, let me take you to Martial Heaven."

Su Yang raised his eyebrows and said, "That won’t do. You will attract too much attention, the opposite of what I want."

"You think you’re the only one who can use disguises? I can do that as well, and I have even better pills than what you were using. Although it’s not easily noticeable, if someone really focuses on you, they will see right through your disguise."

"So you knew since the beginning but still decided to question me?" Su Yang chuckled.

"Not only that, but I have even been secretly watching you ever since you entered the mountain valley." Luo Ziyi said with a big smile on her face, revealing to him that she’d actually been watching him this entire time.

"What?! Is that why you were late?! And you didn’t even bother to help me? I even used one of my precious Sword Talisman!" Su Yang was shocked to learn that Luo Ziyi had been following him for the last two weeks.

"Because it was very entertaining watching you struggle in such a manner, Su Yang. You don’t get to see such scenes very often, after all." Luo Ziyi laughed in a graceful manner, leaving Su Yang speechless.
