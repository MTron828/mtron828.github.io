Chapter 588 Golden Lion Academy“s Invasion 8

"What should we do to them, Grandfather?" Xie Xingfang asked him after Su Yang left them alone.

"I’d like to kill all of them right now, but we will give them the proper punishment after we return to the family." Xie Wang said.

"Okay." Xie Xingfang nodded.

"Hahaha!" Leader Lai suddenly started laughing.

"What’s so funny?" Xie Wang looked at him with a frown. "I will kill you right now if you do not shut up." Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

"Then go ahead and kill me!" Leader Lai spread his arms with a provoking expression on his face, and he continued, "Even if you kill me, you cannot prevent the inevitable! Once the reinforcement from the Holy Central Continent arrives tomorrow, the Eastern Continent will become like a wildfire, and my revenge will be fulfilled either way! Hahahaha!"

"You crazy bastard..." Xie Wang narrowed his eyes at Leader Lai, feeling a strong urge to kill him.

However, Xie Xingfang suddenly spoke, "Unfortunately for you, Su Yang will be here to prevent that."

Leader Lai looked at her with a mocking expression, and he spoke, "Su Yang? What the hell can he do? Although he may be the number one genius here, compared to the experts in the Holy Central Continent, he’s as insignificant as an ant! And it will only take a single finger for the expert coming from the Holy Central Continent to kill him!"

"You may not know this, but the person coming here is actually one of the peak experts from the Holy Central Continent! He is even the Sect Master of one of the largest Sect on the Continent, and his cultivation is even more impressive, being at the fourth level Sovereign Spirit Realm! Hahaha! And you are telling me that a mere junior at the Heavenly Spirit Realm has what it takes to protect this place from him? You are dreaming!"

Xie Xingfang remained calm even after hearing his words, and she said, "No matter who is coming from the Holy Central Continent, they won’t even get the chance to step on this land!"

"Hahaha..." Xie Wang burst out laughing, and he said, "Sovereign Spirit Realm? You have no idea what you’re up against, General Lai! If you think Su Yang is alone then you’re sorely mistaken! He should be the least of your worries!"

"What the hell do you mean by that?" Leader Lai immediately frowned.

"I’m saying that there’s someone stronger that’s backing Su Yang! In fact, I had a taste of her powers not too long ago! I wasn’t even able to last a second under a single breath from her! Even if these people coming are at the peak of the Sovereign Spirit Realm, they won’t be able to defeat her!" Xie Wang spoke with pride despite mentioning his defeat.

"W-What?! That’s impossible! How could such a powerful individual exist in this place without anyone knowing?!" Leader Lai immediately doubted his words.

"There is a saying that all of the true experts within this world remain hidden from the rest of the world, so it’s not weird for one or two unknown experts to show up out of thin air every once in a while." Xie Wang shrugged his shoulders.

"And if you still don’t believe me, remember what happened not too long ago. You just witnessed this very expert achieve the impossible."

"D-Don’t tell me that the expert you are speaking of is that little girl?!" Leader Lai exclaimed.

Xie Wang did not respond and merely showed a wide smile on his face.

"Anyway, you should try your best to enjoy your time inside this formation. It’ll be the last few moments of your life, after all."

Xie Wang and Xie Xingfang returned to the flying ship shortly later, leaving the Moonlight Blades’ members trapped within Su Yang’s formation.

"What are you all doing?! Hurry up and break this formation!" Leader Lai shouted at the people inside.

"Yes, Leader!"

The Moonlight Blades Elders began attacking the formation with their Earth Spirit Realm cultivation base, and Leader Lai also began attacking the formation with his Heavenly Spirit Realm cultivation base.

However, the formation remained unchanged even after taking countless techniques from them for many hours.

"Impossible! How is this formation so powerful when he took so little time to create it?! It shouldn’t be this sturdy and powerful!" Leader Lai gasped for air after running out of spiritual energy from attacking the formation.

Even the other members laid on the floor with exhausted expressions.

Meanwhile, on the flying ship, Xie Wang and Xie Xingfang casually watched them trying to break out of the formation, feeling somewhat entertained by their pointless efforts.

"Su Yang, how confident are you with that formation?" Xie Wang asked him sometime later.

"Although it’s not very powerful, it should keep them inside for about a week even if they continuously attack it without rest." Su Yang casually responded.

"By the way, what do you think about those people coming from the Holy Central Continent? General Lai said that they are peak experts over there." Xie Wang suddenly asked him.

"He’s not lying." Su Yang said, and he continued, "The individual coming here is the Sect Leader of a Sect called the Golden Lion Academy, and they are one of the top three Sects over there."

"Do you think he’s powerful enough to subdue the entire Eastern Continent by himself if you guys were not here?"

Su Yang nodded, "Without a doubt. Not including us, the strongest person in the Eastern Continent is you, who has only recently entered the Sovereign Spirit Realm. If you want comparisons, even if you trained for another thousand years, you still wouldn’t be able to defeat him. Even if all of the Cultivators at the Heavenly Spirit Realm attack him at once, he would still win with ease."

"He’s that powerful...?" Xie Wang felt a drop of sweat roll down his cheeks after hearing Su Yang’s words.

"Well, that’s only natural, as he was born in the Holy Central Continent, where the Profound Qi is much denser and higher in quality compared to this place."

"I see..." Xie Wang nodded.
