Chapter 742 Leaving Behind His Legacy

After spending an hour absorbing the Yang Qi in her body, Cai Yan could already feel her cultivation rising significantly, greatly shocking her.

’This is much more effective than I’d expected!’ Cai Yan cried inwardly. It was no wonder the Profound Blossom Sect disciples managed to reach the True Spirit Realm and Earth Spirit Realm in just half a year from the Elementary Spirit Realm!

At this rate, she might really achieve the Earth Spirit Realm in half a year if not even quicker!

"Looks like you are done," Su Yang said after seeing Cai Yan open her eyes, and he continued, "Let’s continue cultivating."

Cai Yan nodded, and she laid on the bed before spreading her slender legs wide open.

Su Yang inserted his rod into her cave and began cultivating again.

They continued this process until the entire night passed.

Once it was morning, Su Yang left Cai Yan’s living quarters while Cai Yan rested in her room with her body completely exhausted.

"Welcome back, darling. Did you cultivate with someone new yesterday? I can sense unfamiliar Yin Qi on you." Tang Lingxi said to him from the bed. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Su Yang nodded, "Yes, it’s one of my disciples— the one with the Jade Flames. She wanted to reach the Earth Spirit Realm as soon as possible, so she decided to cultivate with me in order to do so."

"What a dedicated young girl," Tang Lingxi said, and she continued, "Did something else happen? I can feel it."

Su Yang approached her with a smile and sat on the edge of the bed before speaking, "I really cannot hide anything from you, huh?"

After a moment of silence, he continued, "Cai Yan, she asked me if I can impregnate her, and I agreed."

"Again? At this rate, you’ll really impregnate every woman in this world before you return to the Divine Heavens." Tang Lingxi chuckled.

"But what’s wrong with that? Do you not want to?"

"No, that’s not it. It just feels weird to impregnate somebody I don’t plan on bringing to the Divine Heavens. When I agreed to impregnate Wu Jingjing and Zhu Mengyi over a year ago, I didn’t want to take responsibility because I was afraid of bringing them to the Divine Heavens, but I had at least thought about it, and they were passionate about it. However, with Cai Yan... it is a little different."

"Furthermore, there are no feelings between Cai Yan and myself, and we’re only cultivating so she can reach the Earth Spirit Realm quicker— it’s merely training."

"I see... I understand what you mean, but that’s quite common in the cultivation world. There are many women out there who conceive with men they don’t even know because they want a talented child, and that is the number one priority for most young ladies from big families out there." Tang Lingxi said.

"Well, I know that, but it still feels weird doing it myself, as I have never willingly impregnated a woman before coming to this world," Su Yang said.

"If you don’t like it, why don’t you just refuse? I can imagine plenty more women will be coming to you for the same purpose in the future once they learn about it."

"Who said I don’t like it? I have always wanted to have my own legacy, but I was too afraid to actually do it. Even though I won’t be taking responsibility for these children, they are still my children nevertheless. Perhaps in the future, once everything has calmed down and I deal with my problems in the Divine Heavens, I will return to this place and see if they still want my help."

"What if thousands of years have passed by then?" Tang Lingxi asked them.

"Whether it be thousands of years or millions of years from now, my legacy will still exist within their bloodline, which is more than enough for me," Su Yang said with a smile on his face.

Sometime later, he said, "Anyways, enough about me. What about you, Lingxi? How long do you have left in that body?"

"Three months at most, I guess," Tang Lingxi looked spoke while looking at her own hands.

"Three months, huh. Well, is there anything you want to do before you return to the Divine Heavens?" Su Yang then asked her.

"Nothing particularly— Or, to be precise, nothing that I want to do can be done."

Tang Lingxi looked at Su Yang and continued, "I am satisfied with just being around you for now. Once you return to the Divine Heavens, I’ll make up for it."

Su Yang nodded with a smile on his face, and the two of them proceeded to talk to each other about random things for the rest of the day.

The following day, Su Yang left the Yin Yang Pavilion to fulfill his duties as the Sect Master of the Profound Blossom Sect by cultivating with the disciples.

Once he’d returned to the Yin Yang Pavilion at the end of the day, he was approached by Liu Lanzhi, who said to him, "Su Yang, there has been an influx of people coming to the Profound Blossom Sect lately— mostly to see you, and the sect elders have been refusing them, but they are getting overwhelmed. Do you think you can do something about it?"

"This must be due to my identity as the Alchemy Master being revealed." Su Yang nodded and said a moment later, "Okay, I’ll do something about it tomorrow."

"One more thing..." Liu Lanzhi pointed to her stomach and said, "It’s almost empty, and I have a few questions regarding the cultivation technique you gave me."

Su Yang nodded and said, "Okay, let me fill you back up before we talk about the technique."

Sometime later, Su Yang followed Liu Lanzhi back into her room, and they began cultivating with each other. After filling Liu Lanzhi’s cave with Yang Qi again, Su Yang began answering all of her questions regarding the technique.

The following morning, Su Yang left the Yin Yang Pavilion again, but he was not going to any disciples’ house. Instead, he went to the entrance of the sect, where a crowd of guests could be seen waiting outside.
