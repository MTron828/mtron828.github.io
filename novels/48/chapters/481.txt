Chapter 482 Visiting the Sun Family

As they reached the city gates, before they even entered the city, Su Yang could already smell money in the air.

"Do you smell that, Su Yang? The smell of money." Sun Jingjing said to him. "The City of Yuan is also known as the land of opportunity. People from all around the continent come here to either start their own business or find jobs — it’s one of the busiest places in the world."

"My Sun Family also started and found success here, hence why this place is very important to us."

Once they reached the gates, the guards stopped them and said, "Are you here to visit or stay? Do you intend on doing business here? Do you have any permits?"

"If you are here to open up your own business, you will need a business permit, which will cost 10,000 gold coins at minimum. If you are only here to visit, you will need a visiting permit, starting at 1 gold coin for 7-days."

Sun Jingjing merely glanced at the guards before retrieving a red badge from her robes.

"T-The Sun Family’s Medallion!"

The guards immediately straightened their backs when they saw the badge, and they all saluted her.

"P-Please enter, esteemed ones!"

A few moments later, Su Yang and his group entered the city without any trouble.

"I knew your family was wealthy when I saw your parents, but I didn’t think you were bigshots in such a rich city." Su Yang said with a smile. "Why did you join the Profound Blossom Sect?"

"According to my parents, my grandfather used to be a massive pervert when he was young, so he joined the Profound Blossom Sect to have fun with girls. However, I joined the Profound Blossom Sect for two reasons. One, because my grandfather who has always spoiled me was here, and two, because I wanted to choose my own partner."

"If I’d remained in the Sun Family, my parents would’ve arranged everything for me — from my husband to my future, and I did not want that. Even if the Profound Blossom Sect is not exactly the best place to look for suitable partners, it is better than being forced into a relationship by my parents."

"I know my story is a common one out there, but I’m glad I made that decision, since I was able to meet you, Su Yang." Sun Jingjing said as she tightened her grasp around his hands.

As they approached the Sun Family’s living quarters, dozens of voices could be heard around them.

"Welcome to the Dragon Warehouse, where you can find all sorts of spirit-grade weapons!"

"Come have a seat in our Gold Horse Restaurant! We have all sorts of spiritual meat to choose from!"

"Visit our lonely girls in the Divine Passion Spa! We have all kinds of beauties to satisfy your needs!"

"The Medicine Nature Hall has just received more Burning Lotus Pills in stock! First come first serve! Get them quick!"

After walking for around half an hour, Su Yang and Sun Jingjing arrived before a large building that occupied the entire street.

"Welcome to my home, Su Yang." Sun Jingjing said with a smile as she pulled him towards the building.

"Y-You are...! Welcome back, Young Lady!" When the guards standing by the front doors noticed Sun Jingjing’s beautiful face, they immediately bowed to her.

"Notify my parents that I have returned with Su Yang," she said to them.

"Right away!"

Sun Jingjing then led Su Yang to the living room.

A few minutes later, Sun Quan and Sun Ren entered the room with bright expressions.

"Oh! You are finally here!"

Sun Ren, her mother, immediately approached Su Yang and gave him a courteous bow. "Welcome to our Sun Family’s humble place, Senior Su."

"Senior?" Su Yang raised an eyebrow.

Even Sun Jingjing couldn’t help but frown at her mother’s odd behavior.

"It appears that I had been rude to Senior Su during our previous meeting. If Senior Su was offended, you can take my daughter as compensation..." Sun Ren said, shocking Sun Jingjing until her jaw was touching the floor.

"W-What are you doing, mother?! Why are you acting so weird?" ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

"Excuse us for a second, Senior Su..." Sun Ren suddenly grabbed Sun Jingjing and pulled her outside.

Once they were fairly distanced from Su Yang, Sun Ren loudly whispered to Sun Jingjing, "Why didn’t you tell me that Su Yang was an expert at the Heavenly Spirit Realm when we visited you?! I feel like a goddamn fool for acting so arrogant before him now! Oh, how ignorant I was!"

"You never asked me, and you were too focused on making him bear responsibility for taking my chastity." Sun Jingjing calmly responded.

"Y-You!" Sun Ren’s face reddened. However, she quickly suppressed her anger and continued, "Anyway, this is your chance, my daughter!"

"Chance? My chance to do what?" she raised her eyebrows in a puzzled manner.

"Your chance to secure a spot in his family! Even if you cannot be his wife, you must become his concubine at least! As the number one genius in the Eastern Continent, he has a limitless future! There are already people saying that he might become the next Lord Xie! Since he has already accepted your body, there’s a good chance that he will accept you as a concubine!"

"..."

Sun Jingjing looked at her mother with a speechless face. This is the first time she’s ever seen her mother acting in such a desperate manner.

"Why do you want me to be with Su Yang so desperately, mother?" Sun Jingjing asked her.

Although she could reveal to her mother that she’s already a part of Su Yang’s family, she decided to keep it a secret for a little bit longer to see why her mother was acting so out of character.

"Aiii... It’s all because of that hateful Mu Family!" Sun Ren sighed. "Ever since they learned that you were a genius at the Earth Spirit Realm, they have been getting increasingly aggressive and desperate trying to seal an engagement between you and their heir, Mu Shun!"
