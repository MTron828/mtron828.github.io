After a brief break, Su Yang and Xie Xingfang continued to look around the Abandoned Forest for the Purple Qilin’s nest. However, since they were unable to use their spiritual sense, they were forced to wander around aimlessly hoping they’d be fortunate enough to encounter it.

"Purple Qilin... They normally live where the toxicity is the strongest, so as long as we can pinpoint the location with the strongest poison mist, we should be able to find its nest," Su Yang said.

"But how are we going to do that? Is there a way for us to tell which area contains more poison mists?" Xie Xingfang asked.

"There is..." Su Yang closed his eyes and took a deep breath.

He then opened his eyes and turned to look in a certain direction before speaking, "The poison mist coming from that direction is slightly more intense than the other directions. If we follow that direction, we should reach the Purple Qilin’s nest sooner or later."

Xie Xingfang nodded, and they began following the trail.

As they approached the location with the deadliest poison mist, their encounters with magical beasts also increased.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The earth shook violently for a moment every time Su Yang used his Sword Qi to instantly slay any magical beasts that dared to threaten him or Xie Xingfang.

After spending an hour following the trail without any breaks, Su Yang and Xie Xingfang finally stopped in front of a massive boulder that had its center caved in, looking like someone had punched the center of a ball of dough, and there were even large leaves neatly placed inside the rock, resembling a nest for some large beast.

"This looks like a nest? And that thing in the middle..." Xie Xingfang’s eyes widened when she noticed the round and large object sitting in the middle of this nest.

"It’s an egg, and judging from its size and shape, it should belong to the Purple Qilin," Su Yang said a moment later.

"A Purple Qilin egg! This is massive, Su Yang! If we can obtain this egg and train the baby Purple Qilin, it could potentially become one of the strongest Guardian Spirit in the Eastern Continent!" Xie Xingfang said to him.

"While that may be the case, it’s also extremely hard to train a Purple Qilin even if you start right after its birth, as they are naturally aggressive towards others," Su Yang said to her.

"Even if that’s the case, we can’t just leave such a priceless treasure here. Because Purple Qilins can only be found in the Abandoned Forest, not many people have seen them before. It’ll be an incredible event if one was brought back to the outside world." Xie Xingfang said.

Su Yang nodded, "Since we’re already here and the egg exists, there’s no reason why we should leave it here. Though we still need to deal with the Purple Qilin first, or it might go on a rampage if it realizes that its child had been taken from her, which could endanger the outside world."

Xie Xingfang then said, "Speaking of the Purple Qilin, I don’t see it anywhere... Let’s hope it’ll return within the next few hours before your pill loses effect."

"Since it has a baby, the Purple Qilin will be returning more often than normal to check up on the baby, so there’s a high chance that it might return within the next few hours. I still have around 7 hours— 9 hours if I start cultivating now."

Xie Xingfang nodded and said, "I’ll keep watch for you so you can focus on cultivating. If the Purple Qilin doesn’t show up in 8 hours, we’re leaving."

"If the Purple Qilin is the lord of this place, we shouldn’t have to worry about other creatures approaching this place," Su Yang said as he took a seat beside the nest.

Once Su Yang closed his eyes and began his cultivation, Xie Xingfang approached Su Yang and stood right beside him, and she began looking out for any signs of danger.

Ten minutes... thirty minutes... one hour... two hours... three hours...

Three hours passed by in the blink of an eye for Xie Xingfang whilst she was focused entirely on defending Su Yang, yet there were still no signs of the Purple Qilin returning.

After another hour of waiting, it suddenly started raining, and this rain was obviously abnormal and was extremely toxic.

"Su Yang, are you okay? This rain seems to be even deadlier than the poison mist..." she asked him in a worried voice.

Su Yang stopped cultivating and said, "I am okay, but this rain will further weaken the effects of my pill, shortening it by another two hours, so I have around four hours left— or three hours."

"Three hours..." Xie Xingfang mumbled with a frown on her face, but alas, there was nothing she could do to help Su Yang in this situation— unless she could somehow give Su Yang her Heavenly Constitution the Thousand Poisons Body.

’If I could give Su Yang my Heavenly Constitution...?’ A thought suddenly appeared in Xie Xingfang’s head, and she slowly turned to look at Su Yang with the corner of her eyes.

’If I recall correctly, the reason the Moonlight Blades wanted me was because of my Heavenly Constitution, as whoever I give my first time to will also obtain my Heavenly Constitution...’

’Su Yang... even though I dislike the fact that he has so many partners, I cannot disregard everything that he’s done for me, nor can I disregard my feelings for him...’

’Su Yang... he will leave this world in two years and return to his own world... The chance of us meeting again is incredibly slim to none...’

’Su Yang... even though he has many partners, he treats them all equally, and none of his current partners seem dissatisfied with their situation or neglected by him...’

After silently pondering to herself for an entire hour, Xie Xingfang took a deep breath before looking at Su Yang with a resolute feeling in her gaze, looking like she’d finally come to a conclusion.
