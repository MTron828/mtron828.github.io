Chapter 1020: Do You Prefer the Real One?

Do You Prefer the Real One?

After spending about ten minutes craving the crystal jade, Su Yang finally finished the work of art, and he showed it to Lin Xinyi, who held a dazed look on her face.

"It... It looks exactly like the one in the store..." She mumbled in a low voice.

"Of course it does. I wouldn’t lie to you. If I say I will do something, I will always do it." Su Yang smiled.

"T-Thank you!" Lin Xinyi bowed to him after accepting the crystal jade that is now a sex toy the shaped of Su Yang’s dragon.

"If you ever need help in the future, I will definitely return this favor!" Lin Xinyi said to him. Lin Xinyi left his place shortly after.

Once they were alone, Su Yang turned to look at Mei Ying and asked her, "Do you also want one?"

Su Yang continued to speak before Mei Ying could even respond, "Or do you prefer the real one?"

Seeing the smile on Su Yang’s face, Mei Ying immediately blushed, but she still nodded her head. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

"I prefer the real one," she said a moment later.

"Let’s first improve your innate talents first. I have the treasures with me."

Su Yang retrieved the treasures he bought at the Treasure Exchange Gallery and placed them on the table. Once everything was prepared, Su Yang summoned his alchemy flames and cooked the treasures until they turned into a single orange-colored pill.

"Here you go." Su Yang handed it to Mei Ying afterward.

"Once you swallow it, your body will feel a little hot, but you don’t need to be alarmed. That’s the effect of the treasure, which will reconstruct your meridians and make them better." Mei Ying nodded.

She swallowed the pill without hesitation the next moment, her trust for Su Yang on full display.

Immediately after swallowing the pill, Mei Ying could feel her body flaring up, almost as though a fire had lit inside her stomach.

This fire continued to burn her body until it felt like her entire body was engulfed in flames.

However, despite the terrifying feeling, it wasn’t painful at all, and it was more of an uncomfortable feeling. The burning sensation stopped ten minutes later "How do you feel?" Su Yang asked her.

"I don’t feel any different," she responded after feeling around her body.

"That’s good." Su Yang said. And he continued, "Now to see how effective it was, let’s go test it out ourselves."

Mei Ying nodded, and they entered her room shortly after.

"Please lie down, Manager. Allow me to please you for a bit first."

Su Yang nodded and laid on the bed. Mei Ying crawled in front of him and began loosening his robes, revealing the hidden dragon inside, and she couldn’t help but stare at it for a moment while thinking to herself that it looked exactly like the pleasure toy Su Yang made for Lin Xinyi.

"Are you wondering why I gave that disciple a replica of my thing?" Su Yang suddenly asked her.

"A little..." She nodded.

"You can say that she is an admirer of mine, so I did her a favor and gave her a replica of my little brother."

"An admirer?" Mei Ying raised her eyebrows.

"Oh, maybe she was a customer before?" She suddenly realized this.

"Perhaps." Su Yang smiled. Mei Ying didn’t continue questioning him and focused on the dragon between his legs. She opened her mouth and began slurping it with passion.

"Mmni..."

Many minutes later, Mei Ying removed her clothes and sat on his rod, riding him like a horse. Su Yang released his Yang Qi inside her body an hour later, filling it to the brim.

"Try cultivating now." He said to her afterward.

Mei Ying nodded and began cultivating, ignoring the sensitive sensation around her body. A couple more hours later, Mei Ying suddenly opened her eyes and exclaimed, "It worked! I can finally absorb the spiritual energy from your Yang Qi!"

"Congratulations." Su Yang smiled.

"This is all because of your effort, Manager. Thank you." Mei Ying stood up and bowed to him "You can thank me by cultivating diligently. You don’t want to lag behind your daughter, now do you?"

"If you say it like that..." Mei Ying chuckled.

"Then I will leave you alone to cultivate. I am going to return to my room." Su Yang left her room shortly after.

"I’m surprised. I never knew you had such talents " Xing Aiying said to him when he returned to the room.

"I am a man of many talents, after all." Su Yang chuckled.

"When did you start doing such things? I would love to know."

"If you really want to know, I will tell you."

Su Yang sat on the bed and spoke, "It all started when I met this woman who was reluctant to let me leave after we spent the night. She told me that she wouldn’t be able to live without my thing and that she would take her own life if I left, but there was no way that I could stay there with her forever, and since she only wanted my little brother, I decided to craft her a replica of it so that she would still be able to enjoy my thing while I am away."

"This trend continued many more times in the future, and before I was aware, replicas of my thing had become widespread."

"Wait... So you were responsible for starting this trend? I thought it was started by some fanatic..."

"It was never my intention to make it into a trend, but it ended up that way." Su Yang shrugged.

After learning Su Yang’s story, Xing Aiying asked him, "Hey, can you also make me one?" Su Yang raised his eyebrows and said, "Why would you want a replica when the real thing is right next to you?"

"Who said anything about using it? I want it for collection purposes. If you don’t want to give me one, that’s fine."

"How can I refuse my own wife’s request? Just give me the material you want the replica in and I will craft it for you." Su Yang quickly said.
