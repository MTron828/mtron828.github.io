Chapter 834 - Why Haven't You Invited Me to Go With You Yet?

"Sister Lan..." Qi Yue looked at Su Liqing with a perplexed expression on her face, unsure how she should react to the situation.

While she was sad that Su Liqing had decided to leave this world without considering her, even forgetting about her for a moment, she couldn’t really blame Su Liqing for wanting to follow Su Yang, as she would’ve done the same.

After a moment of silence, Su Yang said, "Qi Yue, you were one of my very first customers in the sect— one can even say you’re one of my earliest supporters. If I didn’t meet you, I might not have met Liqing."

"Come with me— us to the Divine Heavens. This way, you can cultivate with me once you become an a.d.u.l.t as well as stay with Su Liqing. Of course, as I’d already said previously, there’s no guarantee that you can come back to this world after we leave, so you have to be prepared to never come back."

Qi Yue swallowed nervously, and she spoke in a low voice, "Is it really okay for me to follow you? Won’t I become a bother?"

"Why would you think that? You won’t be a bother." Su Liqing said to her.

"Really?" Qi Yue asked again.

Su Liqing nodded and even went to hug her, "Of course. And it’s not like it’s just going to be three of us. There’ll be plenty more people coming to the Divine Heavens with us."

"..."

After a moment of silence, Qi Yue nodded her head and said, "Okay! I will follow you to the Divine Heavens! No... Please let me follow you!"

Thus, Qi Yue decided to follow Su Yang and Su Liqing to the Divine Heavens.

"Anyways, I’m going to go ahead and leave for now, as I’m already running late on the appointments. The two of you can stay here and talk more if you want."

"Okay. Thank you for your hard work, Su Yang." Su Liqing said to him.

Su Yang left the Yin Yang Pavilion shortly later and began satisfying the disciples in the sect, and as one would have expected, after learning that Su Yang will be leaving soon, the female disciples acted more aggressively during their cultivation, even lasting longer than they normally would.

"Su Yang! Aaaah~!"

The disciple only stopped once they fully lost consciousness.

"..."

"Please... don’t leave..." Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The disciple suddenly mumbled, and Su Yang could see tears forming in the disciples’ eyes as they slept.

"I’m sorry..." Su Yang wiped her tears before meeting with the next disciple.

However, the same scene repeated again and again, and it continued for the rest of the day with almost one in every three disciples crying while they cultivated with him. As for the other two-thirds, they all cultivated until their bodies literally couldn’t take it anymore, as they didn’t want to regret not cultivating with him enough after he leaves.

Furthermore, because he had pushed a week’s worth of appointments back for Qiuyue, Su Yang decided to not return to the Yin Yang Pavilion at night and proceeded to cultivate with the disciples all night.

Even when morning arrived, Su Yang did not return to the Yin Yang Pavilion and continued to cultivate with the next disciple, and he continued to do this for an entire week before taking a day to rest.

Two weeks later, Su Yang visited an old friend.

"It’s me, Su Yang." Su Yang said as he knocked on the door.

A few moments later, a pretty young lady opened the door and appeared before him with a clearly upset expression on her face.

Seeing this, Su Yang spoke with a smile on his face, "What’s the matter, Lu Lifen? You don’t look so happy."

"Of course! And you know very well why I am upset!" Lu Lifen said to him with a frown, and she continued, "Why didn’t you tell me sooner?! That you are going to leave this world?! And why haven’t you invited me to go with you yet?!"

Lu Lifen was clearly more upset about Su Yang not telling her to go with him than the fact that he was leaving this world.

"..."

After a moment of silence, Su Yang sighed, "Lu Lifen, you probably think I had forgotten about you or something, but that is not the case. You’re one of the earliest partners I have had in this life, and it was a memorable one. There was no way I’d forget about you."

"Then why? Why haven’t you told me anything about your departure?"

Su Yang then said, "Lu Lifen, let me ask you this... Do you want to follow me to the Divine Heavens? Leave everything behind in this world and follow me? Do you... really love me?"

One would expect Lu Lifen to immediately respond with a ’yes’, but Lu Lifen remained silent for a minute before mumbling in a low voice, "What makes you think that I don’t love you?"

Su Yang then said, "Even though you claimed that you love me and that you will make me fall for you... do you really believe that? I know when a woman truly has feelings for me or if they just want to cultivate with me, and after cultivating many times with you throughout the months, I could only feel your ’love’ for dual cultivation."

"I..." Lu Lifen opened her mouth, but no words came out.

Su Yang then continued, "Allow me to ask you another question, Lu Lifen. Did your parents tell you to ’fall in love’ with me, just like how they told you to participate in the Chamber of Embrace?"

Lu Lifen’s eyes widened with surprise after hearing Su Yang’s words.

After a moment of silence, Su Yang said to her, "Honestly, I don’t blame you for it, nor will I refuse to cultivate with you because of it. No matter why you’re here, as long as you’re a disciple of the Profound Blossom Sect, I will treat you like I treat every other disciple— with love and passion. So... do you still want to cultivate with me?"
