Chapter 865 - Saying Their Goodbyes

Three days after Su Yang closed the Immortal’s Treasury for the disciples, his family moved into the second floor of the place, where a couple of massive buildings were built beside a clean river.

"What do you ladies think of this place?" Su Yang asked them a day after they settled down in their new homes.

"It’s actually pretty great here. It’s peaceful, and the air is nice and clean. The spiritual energy here is also a little better than outside." Sun Jingjing said.

"If you need changes done to the place, just let me know and I’ll do my best to satisfy it." Su Yang said to them.

"Okay!"

Sometime later, Su Yang said, "Good. Then you’ll all be living here until I find us a safe place in the Divine Heavens. Of course, you don’t actually have to live here until we leave the Profound Blossom Sect. Once we leave the Eastern Continent, you’ll be able to leave this place one more time at the Southern Continent right before we leave this world."

"So, use whatever time you have left to say your farewell to those you care about because there’s a good chance that we’ll never be able to return to this world again."

"I’ll have to say goodbye to my grandfather." Sun Jingjing said.

"I also need to say my goodbyes to my family." Xie Xingfang said.

"Me too." Lian Li said.

Su Yang nodded and said, "Don’t worry, I’ll bring all of you to see your family one last time before we leave."

"Let’s start with Lian Li, Wu Jingjing, and Zhu Mengyi since your families are the furthest away."

"Okay." They nodded.

Sometime later, Su Yang brought the three goddesses to the Holy Central Continent to see their family, starting with Lian Li’s family first.

"Mother, father, brother, as you already know, I will be leaving this world with Su Yang, and there’s a good chance that I will not be able to come back." Lian Li said to them.

"Thank you for everything you’ve done for me." Lian Li bowed to her parents.

"You’re already a grown-up, Lian Li." Her mother said with a heartwarming smile on her face.

She then turned to look at Su Yang and said, "Please, take care of our daughter and granddaughter."

Su Yang nodded, "Don’t worry, I will not let anything happen to them."

Lian Li proceeded to spend the next couple of hours speaking with her family and reminiscing about their history together.

Once it was time for them to leave, Lian Li gave her family a final hug.

"Father, take care of yourself and mother."

"Same with you, mother. Please take care of yourself."

Lian Li then turned to look at her brother and said, "Lian Heng, you make sure you behave yourself. Just because I will no longer be here doesn’t mean you can go wild."

"I won’t..." Lian Heng said in a low voice, his previous arrogance and prideful nature seemingly gone.

The Lian Family had made sure to discipline him properly after learning what he did to Su Yang, hence why he had been absent for so long.

If it weren’t for Lian Li’s departure, he wouldn’t have been allowed to leave his seclusion.

"Goodbye, everyone."

After saying her final goodbye, Lian Li turned around and walked out of the place with Su Yang by her side, not looking back even after they left the area.

As for Su Yang, he left behind a storage ring for the Lian Family, telling them that they could only open it and see the inside in a month from today.

Sometime later, Su Yang brought Wu Jingjing to the Holy Sword Academy so she could meet her father for the last time.

"Thank you for everything you’ve done for me, father. I don’t know when or if I’ll be able to return, but if I can, I will definitely come back." Wu Jingjing handed Wu Min to her father before getting on her knees and kowtowing to him.

"You don’t have to care so much about me, Jingjing. Just go and live your life with Su Yang and your child. I will be fine here. You don’t have to worry about me." Wu Jiang said to her with a resolute smile on his face, as he’d spent the last couple of months preparing himself for their departure.

"Goodbye, Jingjing, Min’er." Wu Jiang gave Wu Min a kiss on the cheeks before handing her back to Wu Jingjing.

He then turned to look at Su Yang and said, "I don’t have to say anything to you, right?"

"I still remember your words on that day very clearly." Su Yang said with a smile.

"You better." Wu Jiang nodded.

"Goodbye, father." Wu Jingjing said to him before turning around and leaving with Su Yang.

"Are you sure you don’t want to spend some more time with him? We still have some time." Su Yang said to her as they left.

"I’m fine. It’ll only be harder for him if I lingered." Wu Jingjing said with slightly teary eyes.

Sometime later, Su Yang went to the Four Seasons Academy with Zhu Mengyi to see her mother. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

"I’m here to say my goodbyes, mother." Zhu Mengyi said to her, who sat there silently with a solemn expression on her face.

"So it’s finally that time, huh?" She looked at them with a small smile on her face.

"I’m going to miss you and Zhu Jiayi— mostly Zhu Jiayi." Her mother sighed.

Zhu Mengyi proceeded to spend a couple of hours speaking with her mother about random things whilst her mother played with Zhu Jiayi.

Once their time ended, Zhu Mengyi hugged her mother and said, "As much as I am relieved to leave this place, I will miss your nagging, mother."

"I will also miss nagging at you, Mengyi. In fact, allow me to nag at you one more time."

After taking a deep breath, her mother spoke, "Stay out of trouble, Mengyi. Take care of Su Yang and Jiayi. I have no doubt that you’ll achieve great things as long as you’re with him."

Zhu Mengyi nodded, "You take care of yourself as well, mother."

They left shortly after, returning to the Eastern Continent.
