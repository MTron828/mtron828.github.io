Three days later, at the Profound Blossom Sect, around 80 people gathered in front of the Sect.

\"I will say this before the Regional Tournament begins, but no matter your results, I will be proud of you! Of course, it would be better for the Profound Blossom Sect if you win a few rounds. With that being said, don‚Äôt push yourself too hard, as I cannot afford to lose any of you here,\" said Liu Lanzhi.

Although the Regional Tournament prohibits slaughter, accidents happen, so there are still risks involved.

\"Yes, Sect Master!\"

The disciples responded with excitement.

\"Okay, now for the arrangements...\"

Liu Lanzhi pointed to the dozen of carriages waiting outside the entrance, all large enough to fit over 5-6 individuals.

\"The sect elders and I will be inside the first carriage. All of the participants will ride in the second and third carriage at the front, whilst everybody else will take the remaining carriages.\"

Before the carriages left, the people that will be staying behind in the Profound Blossom Sect bid farewell.

\"Good luck, disciples!\" Lan Liqing smiled at them with a beautiful expression, her gaze mainly on the carriage that was carrying Su Yang.

A few minutes later, the carriages carrying the disciples left the Profound Blossom Sect.

Meanwhile, inside the carriage carrying Su Yang and 5 other disciples, Sun Jingjing spoke, \"What do you think the chances of the Profound Blossom Sect winning this Regional Tournament will be? It‚Äôs my first time participating in such a large event.\"

\"Although there will be many Cultivators at the True Spirit Realm and even some Earth Spirit Realm geniuses, I cannot see the Profound Blossom Sect losing this Regional Tournament... no matter what.\"

Fang Zhelan gave her opinion. The corner of her eyes looking at Su Yang who was casually sitting in the middle with his eyes closed.

\"Oh, right. Senior apprentice-sister Fang was at the last one, huh.\"

Fang Zhenlan nodded. With that being said, the Profound Blossom Sect lost the last one... and it was not a small loss. In fact, out of the dozens of Sects that participated, the Profound Blossom Sect was dead last.

\"What makes senior apprentice-sister Fang think that we will win this Regional Tournament? Such confidence must have a reason.\"

Sun Jingjing asked her.

\"You will understand when the time comes...\" Fang Zhenlan responded with a nonchalant expression.

Unless another monster with a Heavenly Spirit Realm cultivation appears in the Regional Tournament to match Su Yang‚Äôs presence, besides victory, there‚Äôs no other possible outcome for the Profound Blossom Sect.

\"Is that so...\"

\"Anyway, we have seven whole days before we reach Snowfall City. What should we do until then?\" Sun Jingjing, who was not the type to sit around doing nothing, asked them.

The other disciples in the carriage exchanged glances. What can they do in this small place?

It was at this moment Su Yang opened his eyes, and he spoke with a smile on his face, \"I have a suggestion.\"

\"Hm? What is it?\"

\"Why don‚Äôt we cultivate until we reach our destination? There‚Äôs still a month before the Regional Tournament. We can use this time to increase our cultivation bases as much as possible.\"

\"...\" ùí©ewW ùíèovels updùíÇtes on nov/ùíÜl/b(i)ùíè(.)com

The people there looked at him with a dumbfounded face.

\"Y-You want to cultivate...? Although I support that idea, where are we going to find a place for that?\" Sun Jingjing asked.

\"Place? This carriage has plenty of room.\" Su Yang calmly responded.

\"...\"

The carriage turned dead silent.

\"You want to cultivate here...? But that would mean...\"

The girls in the carriage exchanged awkward glances. Although everyone there has cultivated with Su Yang before, they have never done it with another presence there, much less this many people.

After a moment of silence, one of the disciples spoke, \"I-I don‚Äôt mind.\"

When the first one agreed, like a ripple effect, the rest also agreed soon after.

\"This is getting quite exciting, huh...\"

\"I would‚Äôve never imagined that I‚Äôd be cultivating in the same room as senior apprentice sister Fang...\" Sun Jingjing chuckled.

\"...\"

While she remained calm on the outside, Fang Zhelan was also slightly excited by the situation, especially when this is the first time that she will have to share her partner with others during her cultivation session.

\"Then, without further ado...\"

Su Yang, without any warning, began loosening his robes.

\"Who‚Äôs first?\" he asked with a smile.

Meanwhile, inside the Sect Master‚Äôs carriage, one of the sect elders asked.

\"Sect Master, what are the chances of the Profound Blossom Sect winning this year‚Äôs Regional Tournament?\"

\"Despite the tremendous growth in our disciples, the chances of us winning the Regional Tournament is very small. Our disciples will have to fight against geniuses from other bigger and more powerful Sects, ones that properly train their disciples for combat, something our Profound Blossom Sect severely lacks.\"

One core weakness of the disciples from the Profound Blossom Sect is that they spend all of their time cultivating without caring for their combat prowess, hence why the Profound Blossom Sect lost miserably last time despite their high cultivation bases.

\"In the future, if we can truly restore our Profound Blossom Sect to its former state, I will have to ensure that our disciples will be trained properly...\" Liu Lanzhi sighed inwardly.

\"Speaking of the Regional Tournament, the princess of the Xie Family will be there, right?\" one of the sect elders asked.

\"That‚Äôs correct. However, this will be a problem for us, as her presence will cause the other participants to be more serious and deadly.\"

\"Just to impress her, huh? Our disciples will have it rough this time... perhaps even more so than the last Regional Tournament.\"

\"Ahhhhhh~!\"

Suddenly, the sound of someone moaning entered their carriage.

\"What the fu‚Äî?\"

The sect elders exchanged glances upon hearing this familiar yet puzzling sound.

Liu Lanzhi frowned and used her Profound Qi to figure out the situation, and the instant she looked inside the carriage carrying Su Yang and realized the situation, her face became stupified.

The other sect elders also realized the situation a few moments later.

\"T-This Su Yang is a madman! He‚Äôs actually cultivating with the disciples inside the carriage!\"

One of the sect elders exclaimed, her voice filled with disbelief and admiration for his courage.

\"There‚Äôs a place and time for this! This is too shameless even for our disciples!\"

\"T-That bastard... making my granddaughter do something like this! He has no shame!\" Elder Sun trembled in anger. However, as much as he wanted to burst into their carriage and stop this farce, he resisted his urge, as he did not want to be hated by Sun Jingjing for such actions.
