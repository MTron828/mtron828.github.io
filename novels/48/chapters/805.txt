Chapter 806 - Extreme Yang Qi

"Wow... I didn’t know you could do that... Preserving Yin Qi to cultivate later... Dual Cultivators are truly something else," Lian Li mumbled, feeling as though she’d just learned of a whole new world.

"It’s not uncommon in our world. In fact, some dual cultivators even store their own Yang Qi or Yin Qi and sell them to other dual cultivators— of course, only the powerful ones with unique Yang Qi or Yin Qi would be able to sell it."

"W-Wait a second... Selling Yang Qi and Yin Qi?" Lian LI stared at him with a gawking look, and she couldn’t help but wonder if he’d done such a thing in his previous life.

Su Yang smiled when he saw her face, and almost as though he could read her mind, he responded, "Yes, I have done it before— selling my Yang Qi to dual cultivation sects. In fact, my Yang Qi used to be so popular that sects fight just to have a chance to buy it."

Lian Li swallowed nervously, and she asked, "W-What do you gain in exchange for selling your Yang Qi? Spirit stones? Treasures?"

Su Yang chuckled and said, "Occasionally I would accept treasures if they’re really rare or precious, but I don’t accept money for my Yang Qi."

"You don’t? Then what do you accept?"

Lian Li couldn’t imagine what could be worth more than treasures in the cultivation world.

However, Su Yang did not immediately respond. Instead, he sat on the bed so Xiao Rong could lay on his lap.

"Mmm..."

Xiao Rong m.o.a.ned softly when Su Yang began rubbing her small slit, and Yin Qi began flowing from her hole a few moments later.

Su Yang suddenly spoke as he extracted Xiao Rong’s Yin Qi, "While treasures may be the priority for the major of cultivators, for us dual cultivators, we care more about our own resources."

"In exchange for my Yang Qi, I would accept Yin Qi from other powerful cultivators, and sometimes even the women themselves."

"T-The women? How does that work?" Lian Li asked, still with a dazed look on her face.

"Pure maidens who have divine bodies or Heavenly Constitutions would approach me for my Yang Qi in exchange for their Pure Yin Essence. Of course, most of them would turn around and sell my Yang Qi afterward for actual treasures from others who want it."

"A-And you don’t mind that?"

Su Yang shook his head and said, "I don’t care what they do with my Yang Qi since I’ve already given it to them, and I have already received my payment for it."

"Oh, when I say my ’Yang Qi’, I don’t mean my ordinary ’Yang Qi’."

"There are different types of Yang Qi?"

Su Yang nodded and began explaining, "There are three different types of Yang Qi with the first one being the ordinary Yang Qi that can be released by everyone, mortals and cultivators alike. Then we have Yang Qi filled with spiritual energy, something that can only be released by cultivators and what I’ve been giving you ladies."

"Finally, we have Extreme Yang Qi, something that can only be released by cultivators that have enhanced their Yang Qi with treasures and other resources. And in order to release a small amount of Extreme Yang Qi, it requires many days, even weeks of effort. There are also many different types of effects one’s Extreme Yang Qi can have, but most of the time, it greatly improves one’s cultivation for the female."

"Of course, there are Pure Yin and Yang Essences, but that isn’t categorized because you can only release those once in your lifetime under normal circ.u.mstances."

"Wow... I didn’t think there’d be so many different types of Qi..." Lian Li said, and she continued with a smile on her beautiful face a moment later, "Can you release this Extreme Yang Qi now, Su Yang? I’d like to see the difference."

However, Su Yang shook his head and said, "If I was still in my original body, I’d give you as many Extreme Yang Qi as you want, but now that I am in this body, where my Yang Qi is not as developed, I cannot release any Extreme Yang Qi."

"Though, I should be able to start building my own Extreme Yang Qi after consuming the Hellfire Seed."

"Will it be any different from your previous body’s Extreme Yang Qi?" Lian Li then asked.

"I think so since this is a different body, which should produce its own unique Extreme Yang Qi. We won’t know until then."

"I cannot wait until then," Lian Li said as she licked her lips in an alluring manner.

Su Yang chuckled and said, "After consuming the Hellfire Seed, I should be able to produce some Extreme Yang Qi. Although it won’t be enough to fill you up, it’ll be enough to let you understand what you’ll experience in the future once I can start producing them properly again."

Lian Li nodded with anticipation in her gaze.

Meanwhile, Su Yang continued to extract Xiao Rong’s Yin Qi, filling up bottles after bottles of her sweet nectar.

"Haaa... Master..." Xiao Rong breathed heavily, feeling as though her consciousness was slipping away from her.

A few more minutes later, Xiao Rong fell asleep on Su Yang’s lap.

Seeing this, Su Yang stopped collecting her Yin Qi and cleaned her up before putting her in the bed to rest.

After storing the Yin Qi into his storage ring that was dedicated to storing Xiao Rong’s Yin Qi, Su Yang turned to look at Lian Li and spoke, "Do you want to cultivate?"

Lian Li’s eyes immediately flickered with excitement, and she quickly stood up to loosen her robes.

A few moments later, Su Yang began roaming her beautiful body with his hands, teasing her until she was soaking wet. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

After a few minutes of foreplay, Lian Li used her mouth to please Su Yang’s manhood until it was also soaking wet.

Once they were both prepared and eager to cultivate, they embraced each other and began their cultivation.
