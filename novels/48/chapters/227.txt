When Su Yang was immediately rejected by Li Xiao Mo, the other four male disciples there laughed at him inwardly, as seeing others share the same miserable fate as them helped relieve some pain in their hearts.

"A pig, huh? I don’t think I have ever been called a pig before." Su Yang approached them with a calm smile on his face.

"W-W-Wait! I-I didn’t know it was you!" Li Xiao Mo’s complexion immediately paled upon realizing that the individual she just cursed had turned out to be the one and only Su Yang.

"It’s fine... I understand... you don’t want me here..." Su Yang pretended to be heartbroken by Li Xiao Mo’s response earlier. "I will leave right this moment..."

However, despite his words, he continued approaching her.

"T-That’s not true! I have been waiting to see you for so long!" Li Xiao Mo was on the verge of crying at this moment. To think that her long-awaited reunion with Su Yang would turn out to be so disastrous.

The four male disciples there stared at the two of them with perplex emotions on their faces. None of them were able to understand the situation. Why is Li Xiao Mo acting like this after calling Su Yang a pig? And most importantly, who the hell is Su Yang and what is his relationship with Li Xiao Mo?

And if Su Yang is someone important to Li Xiao Mo then how come none of them know about him?

"Are you so sure about that?" Su Yang ignored the four disciples standing there and staring at him like idiots and walked past them, not even glancing at them as he passed.

"If what you say is true, then why don’t you prove it to me... inside?" Su Yang stood before Li Xiao Mo and spoke.

"P-Please... come inside..." Li Xiao Mo stepped into the house to allow Su Yang to enter.

Once Su Yang entered her house, Li Xiao Mo turned to look at the four disciples with narrowed eyes and said in a cold voice, "I slice off your dick if you bother us —- get lost!"

And she slammed the door shut, leaving the four disciples standing outside with a gawking expression.

Nevermind Li Xiao Mo’s foul language, the way she looked at them as though she was looking at trash caused their hearts to sink like a metal ball thrown from a high area, shattering all of their hopes cultivating with her with a single gaze.

After closing the door, Li Xiao Mo showed Su Yang a place to sit and even served him tea.

"W-What brings you here today, junior apprentice-brother?"

"Junior apprentice-brother, huh?" Su Yang smiled.

Li Xiao Mo’s expression froze, and she quickly corrected herself, "I apologize, Master..."

Su Yang raised an eyebrow. "Who are you calling Master? I don’t remember making you my student or servant."

"Eh? But just now you..." Li Xiao Mo looked at him with wide eyes. If he wasn’t annoyed at her calling him junior apprentice-brother then why did he just act as though he was offended by it?

"Forget about the minor things and let’s talk about why I am here today," Su Yang retrieved a glass bottle from his robes and placed it on the table before him.

"What is that?" Li Xiao Mo asked him after seeing the glass bottle that seemed to be containing some sort of transparent liquid substance.

"This is a specially made substance called Euphoric Oil; if you rub it on your body, it will strengthen your Yin Qi and intensify your pleasure."

"E-Euphoric Oil?" Li Xiao Mo was startled.

She has never heard of such a thing before and was certain that the Profound Blossom Sect did not have such a miraculous treasure.

"Where did you get such a thing? The Profound Blossom Sect will go crazy if they learn of it!"

"Where it came from does not matter," said Su Yang.

"Then what do you want from me? Seeing that you have shown it to me, I am guessing that you want me to do something with it?" she asked him.

"That’s correct," he nodded, and continued, "I want you to take this bottle of Euphoric Oil and share it with as many of your friends as possible."

"Y-You want me to share this Euphoric Oil with others? Are you not afraid that the Sect will be coming after you afterward?" she asked in a concerned tone.

"There’s no need to worry about the Sect because I intend on visiting the Sect Leader after this," Su Yang said with a smile. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

"I-Is that so... Then what should I do after sharing it?"

"You will find out after you share it," he answered.

"I understand..." she nodded despite not truly understanding.

After a moment of silence, Li Xiao Mo looked at Su Yang with a reserved face and asked him, "Umm... is there anything else that you need from me?"

Although it was hidden under the table, Li Xiao Mo was fidgeting with her fingers, as she was hoping that Su Yang had other intentions for seeking her today.

"Hmm? What makes you think that?" Su Yang asked with a mysterious smile.

Li Xiao Mo’s face slightly flushed, and she spoke, "About what you said before..."

Normally she wouldn’t beat around the bush when it comes to speaking her mind like when she chased away the four disciples outside, but Li Xiao Mo was finding it especially difficult to utter even a single word without sounding bashful when speaking to Su Yang.

Seeing Li Xiao Mo’s reaction, Su Yang chuckled and said, "Don’t worry, I do not intend on making you work for me without any payments."

"T-That’s not what I mean!" she hastily said. "I will gladly do this job for free!"

"Are you sure?" Su Yang smiled. "And I was thinking of giving you a special massage as a payment..."

Li Xiao Mo’s expression froze after hearing his words. Once again she had spoken way too early.
