Chapter 833 - There's Only One Solution

After arriving at the Yin Yang Pavilion, Su Liqing said to Qi Yue, "Wait here for a bit. I’ll go speak with Su Yang first."

Qi Yue nodded and stayed outside while Su Liqing went to look for Su Yang in his room.

"Su Yang, are you here?" Su Liqing knocked on his door a moment later.

The door opened a few seconds later, and Su Yang appeared in front of her with a smile on his face, "How rare. I am usually the one that’s visiting you. Do you need anything from me? I am about to catch up on the appointments I’d pushed back."

"I do need something, but it’s not about me..." Su Liqing said in a sighing voice.

Su Yang raised his eyebrows, "Did something happen?"

Su Liqing nodded and said, "It’s about Qi Yue."

"I see..." Su Yang immediately realized the situation and said, "There’s nothing I can do. I cannot cultivate with a minor no matter the circ.u.mstances. You should know that."

"Of course, I know that. I’m not here to ask you to cultivate with her. Instead, I’m wondering if there’s anything else we can do for her." Su Liqing said.

And she continued, "You may not know this, but Qi Yue and I... We’re like sisters. I have known her parents even before I became a disciple at the Profound Blossom Sect, so I knew Qi Yue even before her birth, and she decided to follow me to the Profound Blossom Sect when she became old enough to cultivate."

"I... I also promised her parents that I’d take care of her for as long as I could before they passed away. This may sound horrible, but I’d forgotten about that, as we haven’t really spoken to each other ever since the Profound Blossom Sect changed. I have been busy with my own things while she focused on her own training."

"To make matters worse, I have yet to tell her that I’d be leaving this world to go to the Divine Heavens with you, and I don’t really have the courage to tell her anymore." Su Liqing sighed.

After a moment of silence, Su Yang spoke, "Do you have any suggestions? What do you want me to do?" CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

"I..." Su Liqing opened her mouth but didn’t actually speak, acting hesitant to continue.

Seeing this, Su Yang grabbed her hands before speaking in a gentle voice, "It’s okay. You can tell me."

Su Liqing nodded and said, "This may sound very selfish of me but if she— Qi Yue agrees, would you be willing to take her to the Divine Heavens with us?"

Su Yang smiled and said, "I figured you’d say something like this."

"Qi Yue’s outside right now, right? Ask her to come inside. I’ll speak with her."

Su Liqing nodded and went outside for a minute before returning with Qi Yue by her side.

"Sect Master..." Qi Yue stood before him with a timid look on her face, looking like a child who was able to be lectured.

However, Su Yang smiled and said, "Just call me Su Yang like you used to, and I didn’t call you here to yell at you so you can calm down."

"Sit down." Su Yang pointed at the chair behind him.

Qi Yue nodded and obediently took a seat.

Su Yang then cleared his throat and said, "So... you want to cultivate with me no matter what, right?"

Qi Yue quickly nodded again.

"However, I have already told you that I cannot cultivate with you because you’re still a minor, and by the time you’re an a.d.u.l.t, I will have already left this world long ago."

"I know that, but... what can I do? I really want to cultivate with you, Su Yang! I have wanted to cultivate with you ever since you helped me!" Qi Yue said with a resolute face.

Ever since Su Yang treated her and saved her life, Qi Yue has decided to give her everything to him— even her own body. In fact, everything she has done up to this point, especially her training, was to prepare for the day when she could finally cultivate with him so that she wouldn’t disappoint him once they were on the bed.

But alas, looking at the situation now, perhaps everything she has done might’ve been in vain.

After a moment of silence, Su Yang said, "No matter how much you want to cultivate with me, I cannot cultivate with you until you’re an a.d.u.l.t, so there’s only one thing we can do in this situation."

And he continued after a slight pause, "That is for you to come with me to the Divine Heavens. This way, I can cultivate with you once you become an a.d.u.l.t."

Qi Yue’s eyes widened with surprise after hearing his words— surprised that she didn’t think of this solution.

One would expect Qi Yue to immediately nod her head, but she merely turned her head to look at Su Liqing, clearly hesitant to leave Lan Liqing’s side.

"Liqing, this is your moment." Su Yang suddenly said, snapping Su Liqing out of her daze.

"Oh! Right!"

Su Liqing took a deep breath before looking at Qi Yue dead in the eyes and speaking in a serious manner, "Qi Yue... I have something important to tell you, but I would like to apologize first for not telling you this sooner."

After taking another deep breath, Su Liqing said, "I... I will also be leaving this world to go to the Divine Heavens with Su Yang."

"What?!" Qi Yue’s eyes widened with shock, and she exclaimed in a startled voice, "S-Since when did you decide this, Sister Lan?!"

"A while ago..." Su Liqing said, and she continued, "And I am no longer Lan Liqing. I have not only joined Su Yang’s family, but I have also taken his surname, so I am now Su Liqing."

"Unbelievable..." Qi Yue mumbled in a dazed voice.

"I know you’re probably thinking that I’d purposefully decided to leave you behind but that’s really not the case. It just slipped from my mind, and I am very sorry for that, especially since I’d promised your parents that I’d take care of you." Su Liqing apologized to Qi Yue again, even lowering her head to show her sincerity.
