After speaking with Wang Chen for a few more minutes, Wang Shuren returned back to the Burning Lotus Sect to see if Su Yang has emerged from his cultivation yet, as she had a few questions that she’d really like to ask him.

"Su Yang!" Wang Shuren was slightly bewildered when the first thing she noticed upon walking into her house was Su Yang casually sipping tea on her couch.

How can he act so casually after killing someone from the Wang Family? Although he may not fear the Wang Family, he should still be somewhat wary of the consequences, as he’d killed not just someone from the Wang Family but also an Inner Court disciple from Burning Lotus Sect whilst in their territory!

If the Burning Lotus Sect finds out, they might hunt him down!

"What’s wrong? Your face is filled with worry," Su Yang placed the tea down and said.

"I have a few questions I’d like to ask you... and I’d appreciate if you told me the truth," Wang Shuren prepared to herself to question him. "It’s about Wang Ming..."

However, before she could even ask him anything, Su Yang opened his mouth and spoke with a calm voice, "Yes, I killed him."

Wang Shuren’s eyes widened. Though, because she had already guessed that he would be Wang Ming’s killer, she wasn’t shocked by the reveal. Instead, she was surprised at how nonchalant his attitude was towards all of this.

"Are you angry that I killed someone from your family? Do you want to avenge him?" Su Yang then asked her, his voice still as calm as ever.

However, Wang Shuren could tell that Su Yang was only testing her, and she responded, "No, I do not feel anything over that animal’s death, and he most definitely deserved it after everything he’s done. And on the contrary, I’d like to thank you for taking care of him, as I couldn’t due to my relationship with his parents. But if you don’t mind me asking, why did you do it?"

"I did not like him, that’s all." Su Yang gave her a simple answer. But such an answer caused Wang Shuren to tremble in fear.

"He would risk the entire Burning Lotus Sect and the Wang Family going after him to kill Wang Ming simply because he didn’t like Wang Ming? Is he simply too arrogant or extremely confident that they wouldn’t be able to touch him?" Wang Shuren pondered.

Either way, his actions proved just how dangerous of an existence Su Yang was. Not only are his abilities heaven-defying but even his background is nothing short of fearsome.

To offend someone as dangerous as Su Yang is akin to courting death — no... it’s definitely even more terrifying than courting death and more like begging to be killed.

"Anyway, if you are not here to avenge that clown, then why are you here?" Su Yang asked her.

"Umm... this is my house?" Wang Shuren said with a dumbfounded face.

"Oh, right." Su Yang burst out laughing. He was feeling so comfortable that he’d thought he was at home.

"That being said, I will act as though Wang Ming died of natural causes. As for the Wang Family and the Burning Lotus Sect, as long as I don’t say anything, there’s zero chance that the truth will be revealed."

"Won’t that be considered as an act of treachery?" Su Yang smiled.

Wang Shuren became speechless for a moment before saying, "I am willing to betray my own family and Sect if it’s for you..."

Wang Shuren immediately blushed after saying those words. She had spoken without thinking and couldn’t have imagined that such words would come out of her mouth even in a million years.

"How admirable..." Su Yang smiled.

"A-Anyway, how did your cultivation go? Did you achieve your goals?" Wang Shuren decided to lessen her embarrassment by changing the topic.

Su Yang did not say anything and only nodded with a smile.

"Is that why you seem so happy? Want to tell me about it?"

"You wouldn’t believe it even if I told you."

"Try me."

Su Yang shook his head and stood up from his seat and said, "Trust me, you don’t want to know. Anyway, I should leave now. I have already stayed here for too long."

Wang Shuren didn’t know what to say to him as she watched him approach the door; it was as if her lips were stitched shut, forcing her to watch him leave in silence.

At the end of the day, this is how much their relationship amounted to. Although he treated her as though she was his own disciple, even lecturing her, they are only accomplices, and Wang Shuren couldn’t think of anything reasonable to say to him, as she was in no position to tell him to stay here even for a second longer.

In the end, Wang Shuren bid farewell to Su Yang with a smile on her alluring face, "As long as I am alive, I will be here whenever you need me again." Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

If it were anyone else, they would’ve definitely turned around upon seeing Wang Shuren’s reluctant eyes, perhaps even embrace her while telling her that he’ll stay just for her.

Su Yang did not look back and continued to walk, but a few seconds later, Su Yang retrieved a few scrolls from his storage ring and tossed it at Wang Shuren.

"Study those pill recipes while I am gone and I may return in the future for your help with those and perhaps more, who knows..."

Wang Shuren accepted these pill recipes with a delighted face. While she has yet to look at these pill recipes, she was confident that they were all extremely valuable pills and would shock the world if known.

"And don’t slack on your technique just because you are slightly better than before, or else I will have to slap your butt as punishment." Su Yang said whilst laughing out loud.

"Slap my what—?!" Wang Shuren instinctively covered her round buttocks after hearing his words, and on her face was an expression of bewilderment mixed with bashfulness. His last words were as unexpected as his sudden appearance in the Burning Lotus Sect, and it gave Su Yang’s handsome and mysterious image in her head more of a perverted feeling.

"Truly a dangerous man!" Wang Shuren thought to herself as he watched Su Yang’s figure disappeared from her sight.
