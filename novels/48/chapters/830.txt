Chapter 831 - Announcing His Depature

After spending a few days with Xie Xingfang and their children, Su Yang returned to the Profound Blossom Sect to prepare for the upcoming breakthrough.

However, the moment he arrived at the Yin Yang Pavilion, Liu Lanzhi approached him and said, "Su Yang! The disciples have been bombarding me ever since they found out that you‚Äôll be leaving this world in less than a year!" Liu Lanzhi said to him in a somewhat panicked voice.

"Why did you announce that to the world? Now everybody knows you‚Äôll be gone soon! That might give people bad ideas if it hasn‚Äôt already!"

After all, if people knew that Su Yang will be gone from the Profound Blossom Sect, they could plan to mess with them after he leaves since there‚Äôll be nobody else to protect them.

However, Su Yang shook his head and said, "Trust me, it won‚Äôt matter even if the entire world knew of my departure, and it‚Äôs not something that can be hidden forever. Eventually, people will find out that I am no longer in this world."

"It may not feel like it, but currently, the Profound Blossom Sect is one of the top powers in the Eastern Continent if not the entire world, and we have support from many other top sects and families."

And he continued, "Not even mentioning our Alliance with the Heavenly Swan Sect, Burning Lotus Sect, and the Xie Family, we also have the Divine Nature Garden that will be indebted to us forever as well as other powers from the other continents. These past few months, I have been tightening our relationsh.i.p.s with each other, and it‚Äôs at the point where even if I leave now, nobody would be able to hurt the Profound Blossom Sect."

"Furthermore..." Su Yang suddenly lifted his hand and pointed at her.

"There‚Äôs also you, the Sect Master of the Profound Blossom Sect. As long as you lead the sect, everything will be fine. I‚Äôm sure of it."

Liu Lanzhi was left speechless after hearing Su Yang‚Äôs words.

"Anyways, gather the disciples. Since they already know I‚Äôm leaving, I might as well give an official statement." Su Yang suddenly said a moment later.

"I... I understand..." Liu Lanzhi nodded her head and immediately summoned every single disciple in the sect using her jade slip.

An hour later, every single Profound Blossom Sect disciple gathered in the Outer Court, filling the gathering area to the brim.

"This is probably about the Sect Master leaving this world. Do you think it‚Äôs true?" One of the disciples there mumbled.

"Who knows. I hope it‚Äôs not true since it‚Äôll be a devastating loss for the sect and the female disciples if the Sect Master leaves this world, as this means we‚Äôll no longer be able to feel his touch ever again..."

"At least we managed to embrace him before he left... Can you imagine what the Junior Disciples must be feeling? Many of them won‚Äôt be able to embrace him at all because they‚Äôre still too young! And by the time they become a.d.u.l.ts, the Sect Master will be long gone!" Finndd the newùíÜst ùíèovels on n/ùíê/velbin(.)com

"Luckily for me, I became an a.d.u.l.t last month and gave my Pure Yin Essence to the Sect Master..."

Sometime later, Su Yang appeared in the area, and he hovered above the gathering area and the disciples so they could all see him properly.

"Thank you all for gathering here despite the short notice," Su Yang said to them after taking a deep breath.

And he continued, "As all of you may have heard by now, I will be leaving this world in about a year, and it‚Äôs true. I won‚Äôt stay in this world for much longer."

"Aaaah! So it was true after all!"

"Nooo! Sect Master! Don‚Äôt leave us!"

A commotion immediately erupted at the place with many of the female disciples there crying out loud after Su Yang confirmed that the rumors were indeed true.

"Please, don‚Äôt leave us, Sect Master! My body needs you!"

"Sect Master, please reconsider! I still need two years before I can cultivate! Or... Or make an exception so the Junior Disciples can cultivate with you before you leave!"

Su Yang hovered in the air with a nonchalant look on his face as hundreds of disciples pleaded him to stay in the sect, but alas... that was not possible.

However, Su Yang did not say anything and allowed the disciples to cry to their hearts‚Äô content.

Once the place began quieting down again, Su Yang cleared his throat and said in a calm voice, "I understand your feelings very well as I also wish to stay here, but there are things I must do in the Divine Heavens, so I cannot stay here."

"Sect Master! Will we get to see you ever again?!" Someone there suddenly asked him.

Su Yang shook his head and said, "Unfortunately, I cannot answer that question because even I do not know if I will ever come back. Of course, I will definitely try to return to this place once I accomplish all of my goals, but whether I‚Äôll be able to return to this world or not after I leave this place is still unknown."

"Sect Master... do you really have to leave?" Another disciple then asked him in a timid voice.

"Yes, I do." Su Yang nodded with a serious look on his face.

After a moment of silence, Su Yang continued, "Therefore, starting from this point forth and until it‚Äôs time for me to leave, I will spend almost every day cultivating with you."

"W-What about us, the Junior Disciples, Sect Master?!" One of the Junior Disciples there suddenly asked, and everybody there turned their heads to look at the young disciple who just spoke, and to their surprise, this Junior Disciple was Qi Yue, who was only two years away from becoming an a.d.u.l.t.

Su Yang looked at Qi Yue with an apologetic smile on his face, and he said, "I‚Äôm sorry, but it‚Äôs against the sect rules and I cannot ignore the rule just because I am the Sect Master. Furthermore, I cannot cultivate with someone underaged. I know it sucks, but there‚Äôs really nothing I can do in this situation."
