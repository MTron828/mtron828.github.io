Chapter 861 - Teasing Xiao Rong's Rear End

"Loosen up your body, Xiao Rong." Su Yang instructed her as he licked his finger wet.

Once his finger was soaked in his saliva, Su Yang poked Xiao Rong’s closed butthole with it.

Xiao Rong experienced the chill down her spine again, and the chill only grew stronger the deeper Su Yang’s finger dug deeper into her narrow butthole.

A few seconds later, when his entire finger was inside her butthole, Su Yang asked her, "How do you feel, Xiao Rong?"

"Weird..." she quickly responded.

"Then let’s try moving it around."

Thus, Su Yang began thrusting her narrow butthole with his finger.

Xiao Rong’s cave immediately began drooling with Yin Qi.

"This response... I think your body enjoys it, Xiao Rong." Su Yang chuckled after seeing this.

Even if Xiao Rong couldn’t understand it, her body was honest and reacted to Su Yang’s finger naturally.

"Master... Do it again..." Xiao Rong suddenly said to him.

"Hmm? Do what? This?" Su Yang pushed his finger deep inside her hole before pulling it back again.

"Yes... It makes my body feel... hot..." Xiao Rong said.

Hearing Xiao Rong’s soft voice, Su Yang began thrusting his finger a little quicker.

"Mmmm~!"

Xiao Rong began m.o.a.ning in a gentle voice.

After teasing Xiao Rong’s butthole for a couple of minutes, Su Yang stopped and asked her, "Do you want to feel it more?"

After a moment of silence, Xiao Rong nodded her head silently.

Sometime later, Su Yang got off the bed and stood beside it while Xiao Rong kneeled on all fours on the bed.

It would be a waste to take Xiao Rong’s maiden status when he cannot absorb her Pure Yin Essence, so he could only please her through the rear end instead of the front, kind of like Qiuyue’s situation.

However, since Xiao Rong has the smallest body out of all his partners up to this point, Su Yang made sure to lube up his rod and Xiao Rong’s hole plenty before sticking it inside her.

Once his rod was dripping wet, Su Yang pressed the tip of his rod inside Xiao Rong’s tight butthole.

"Mmm!" Xiao Rong could feel her butthole being spread wide open by Su Yang’s thick rod.

Even though she was at the Ancient Realm, she was still able to feel the pain of her buttcheeks being spread apart for the first time.

"Are you okay?" Su Yang asked her.

"Un..." She nodded silently.

Su Yang firmly held onto her small h.i.p.s and began moving his own h.i.p.s, thrusting his stiff rod in and out of her b.u.t.t. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Of course, Su Yang didn’t forget to collect Xiao Rong’s Yin Qi, and he would replace the bottle between her legs whenever it got full for a new one.

Xiao Rong’s b.u.t.t was extremely tight— one of the tightest holes he has experienced since his reincarnation, but that was to be expected from someone with such a petite body.

It was even a miracle that he was able to fit his massive rod inside Xiao Rong’s hole.

"Xiao Rong, try to relax your body and loosen your muscles. You’ll crush my precious thing at this rate," Su Yang spoke in a joking tone, yet his rod was truly on the verge of being crushed by Xiao Rong’s reflexes.

"Sorry, Master..." Xiao Rong eventually became more relaxed as she got used to the feeling of Su Yang’s rod moving inside her body.

Many minutes later, Su Yang pulled his rod out of Xiao Rong’s b.u.t.t and said to her, "I’m about to release my Yang Qi."

Hearing his words, Xiao Rong immediately turned around and opened her mouth, wrapping around Su Yang’s rod a second later.

Once Xiao Rong closed her mouth, Su Yang released his Yang Qi directly inside her mouth.

The Yang Qi quickly filled Xiao Rong’s small mouth, but it didn’t overfill it since Xiao Rong left her throat open, allowing the Yang Qi to flow directly down her throat and into her stomach.

The instant the Yang Qi reached her stomach, it would evaporate into spiritual energy and replenish Xiao Rong’s spiritual energy.

However, since Su Yang’s cultivation base was too insignificant, his Yang Qi barely affected Xiao Rong’s cultivation— if it affected her at all.

As for Xiao Rong, she only cared about the rich and flavorful taste of his Yang Qi.

After Xiao Rong s.u.c.k.e.d Su Yang dry, she turned her body back around with her small b.u.t.t lifted into the air, signaling to Su Yang that she wanted him to please her body more.

Su Yang smiled at this, and he quickly inserted his rod back inside Xiao Rong’s hole that had already been restored back to its original state.

The two of them continued to cultivate in this manner for the rest of the day.

Of course, in Xiao Rong’s eyes, who got to consume his Yang Qi for a month straight before, a single day of cultivation was incredibly short, and she was not satisfied at all.

"Don’t make that sad face, Xiao Rong. I’ll let you eat again in a few days." Su Yang said to her afterward.

In this world, Xiao Rong is probably the only one he won’t be able to completely satisfy simply because of her ridiculous appetite and his lack of cultivation base.

While he could feel Xiao Rong until she is completely satisfied, which could take many months, they simply didn’t have the time to do so, especially when their journey back to the Four Divine Heavens was so close.

"Okay." Xiao Rong didn’t say anything else before leaving his room to go to Qin Liangyu’s room, as she was still being taught by her.

Meanwhile, Su Yang organized the Yin Qi he’d obtained from Xiao Rong.

"She’s like an endless source of Yin Qi... If only I could absorb them..." Su Yang sighed as he stored the bottles of Yin Qi that numbered in the hundreds.
