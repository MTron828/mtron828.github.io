Chapter 855 - Treasure Hunt

"Thank you, Sect Master! I love you!" The disciples said to him as they crowded around him in the sect.

"When can we go inside, Sect Master?!"

"How long can we stay inside?!"

"Do we have a limit to how many treasures we can obtain inside the Immortal’s Treasury?"

The disciples bombarded Su Yang with questions before he could even get the chance to leave the place.

"Calm down, I will answer all of your questions." Su Yang said to them, and he continued, "You can go inside whenever you want during the period that the Immortal’s Treasury is out."

"You can also stay inside for as long as the Immortal’s Treasury is available."

"There is no limit to how many treasures you can obtain, so go ahead and try to collect as much as you can. This is the cultivation world, after all. You can’t be satisfied with just a single treasure in your lifetime— no cultivator can."

After saying that, Su Yang stepped to the side to allow the disciples to enter the Immortal’s Treasury.

"Have fun," he said to them with a smile on his face.

Immediately, the disciples began rushing inside the place, crowding the first floor.

"H-Hey! Don’t block the entire hallway! I’m trying to get to the second floor here!"

"S-Stop pushing! Are you trying to suffocate me to death?!"

The chaotic scene continued for almost half an hour before the sect elders arrived at the scene to organize things, allowing the disciples to finally descend to the second floor without needing to exhaust all of their strength just to get there.

The treasures on the first floor were cleaned out within minutes due to how small the place was and the lack of places to hide them.

"I found an Earth Advancement Pill!"

"I got a Spirit-grade spiritual treasure!"

On the second floor, the disciples swarmed the place like a group of ants.

However, since there were magical beasts on the second floor, the disciples had to be more careful and wary, and they couldn’t just walk around with their heads down like they did on the first floor.

Meanwhile, the stronger disciples in the sect went straight to the third floor, where magical beasts as strong as the Earth Spirit Realm existed.

While the disciples explored the Immortal’s Treasury and participated in Su Yang’s treasure hunt, Su Yang himself was resting in the Yin Yang Pavilion with Lian Li.

"Looks like you’ll give birth in a month and a half at this rate," he said to her as he gently c.a.r.e.s.sed her round belly.

"I’m kind of nervous," Lian Li said.

"I have never felt like this before..."

"There’s always a first time for something," said Su Yang.

Sometime later, Lian Li said, "I have been wondering, Su Yang, but can men have a unique Yang Qi that allows them to give a higher birth rate to one gender over the other? Wu Jingjing and Zhu Mengyi, they’ve both given birth to a girl. Now, I am also giving birth to a girl. Only Xie Xingfang managed to give birth to a boy, but she also has a daughter."

"It might have something to do with the way I cultivate my Yang Qi, but I cannot really tell you for certain since I haven’t i.m.p.r.e.g.n.a.t.ed any women before coming to this world— at least not that I am aware of."

"It could be mere coincidences that all of you have daughters, but it could also be caused by my Yang Qi. We won’t really know until we have more results." Su Yang said.

"That makes sense," Lian Li nodded.

"Why? Do you prefer a boy?" Su Yang asked her.

"Whether it’s a boy or girl— that doesn’t matter to me. All that matters is that I am conceiving your child, Su Yang." Lian Li said with a smile.

Su Yang nodded and said, "If you really want a boy, there are treasures out there that can improve the chances."

"Really? Such medicine exists?" Lian Li looked at him with a surprised face.

"Of course. There are medicines for almost everything in this world. The possibilities are endless." Su Yang chuckled.

"Anyways, get some rest. I’m going to cultivate with the others now."

"Okay." Lian Li nodded as she laid on the comfortable bed.

After spending a few days cultivating, Su Yang visited Yan Yan to see her progress.

"How do you feel? Are you getting close to the Sovereign Spirit Realm?" Su Yang asked her.

Yan Yan nodded and said, "The Moon Rock is a very powerful treasure. My cultivation speed increases significantly at night, especially during clear nights when there’s nothing blocking the moonlight."

"That’s good to hear. Well, you still have around two months to reach the Sovereign Spirit Realm before I leave this world."

"..."

Yan Yan looked at him with a profound expression on her face.

"Master... Can I follow you to the Divine Heavens?" she suddenly asked him.

"You... want to follow me?" Su Yang raised his eyebrows.

"I have told you this before, but your talents are very unique. They may work in this world, but there’s no guarantee that you’ll have the same talents in the Divine Heavens since the spiritual energy there is different from the ones here. There’s even a good chance that you might become an ordinary cultivator in the Divine Heavens."

"Are you sure that you want to risk it? Your life won’t be the same."

"I—" Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Su Yang shook his head and said, "Don’t answer me now. Think about it some more— carefully. There’s a little over two months before I leave. You have plenty of time to decide."

"I understand, Master." Yan Yan nodded her head obediently.
