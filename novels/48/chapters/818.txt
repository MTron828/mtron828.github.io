Chapter 819 - Moon Rock

`After returning to the Profound Blossom Sect, Su Yang began preparing for Xie Xingfang’s upcoming delivery.

Once he was fully prepared, Su Yang went to check up on his disciple Yan Yan, who was stuck at the peak of the Heavenly Spirit Realm just like Su Yang.

"So you cannot breakthrough to the Sovereign Spirit Realm even with the help of your godly talents, huh?" Su Yang looked at Yan Yan with a pondering expression on his face.

"I guess we can only rely on treasures at this point." Su Yang then retrieved Qiuyue’s storage pouch and took out one of her treasures before offering it to Yan Yan.

"This is called a ’Moon Rock’, and it’s a priceless treasure that was brought here from a very distant place. The way you use this Moon Rock is by setting it where there is moonlight and cultivate beside it, and it will greatly boost your cultivation speed. However, you can only use this when the moon is out. I’ll lend it to you for now."

And he continued, "Although I can simply give you a treasure that can directly boost your cultivation base, it might actually do more harm than good for you since you have a unique talent that mostly focuses on cultivating naturally. If you rely too much on external resources, your talents might be affected negatively."

Yan Yan accepted the beautiful glowing rock and said, "Thank you, Master."

After lecturing her for a few hours, Su Yang left Yan Yan’s place and went to Zhang Xiu Ying’s place to check on her progress with the technique he’d refined for her.

"Su Yang, I have managed to reach the peak Earth Spirit Realm three days ago." Zhang Xiu Ying greeted him with a bright expression on her pretty face.

And she continued, "Coupled with your powerful Yang Qi, this cultivation technique is really heaven-defying."

Su Yang nodded and said, "Great, now you only need a Heavenly Transcendence Pill to enter the Heavenly Spirit Realm."

Due to Su Yang’s refined cultivation technique and his Yang Qi that coincidentally complemented the cultivation technique, Zhang Xiu Ying’s cultivation base soared and she was able to surpass the others like Fang Zhelan and Sun Jingjing.

Of course, Su Yang could also give refined cultivation techniques to Fang Zhelan and Sun Jingjing as well as his other partners, but he had something else in mind for them, which required for them to return to the Divine Heavens.

"How does the Heavenly Transcendence Pill work? Do I just consume it and I’ll immediately breakthrough to the Heavenly Spirit Realm?" Zhang Xiu Ying asked him, as this will be her first time consuming such a treasure.

Su Yang nodded and said, "Yes. You don’t even need to cultivate until you are half-step into the Heavenly Spirit Realm."

Su Yang then retrieved the Heavenly Transcendence Pill and handed it to Zhang Xiu Ying.

"Consume it and start cultivating as though you’re preparing for a breakthrough," Su Yang said to her afterward.

Zhang Xiu Ying immediately sat down in the lotus position and tossed the Heavenly Transcendence into her mouth before consuming it.

Zhang Xiu Ying could quickly feel a burst of spiritual energy explode in her mouth before flowing down her stomach and spreading throughout her body, feeling somewhat nostalgic feeling for some reason, almost like she was used to this kind of feeling.

A few minutes later, Zhang Xiu Ying’s aura suddenly expanded, meaning that she’d successfully entered the Heavenly Spirit Realm. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

"Congratulations, Xiu Ying. You have reached the Heavenly Spirit Realm."

"I... This wouldn’t have been possible without you, Su Yang." Zhang Xiu Ying said with a loving gaze.

Never in her life could she have imagined that she would one day reach the Heavenly Spirit Realm at such a young age— not even in her wildest dreams.

"If you’re excited about your achievements now, just wait until we go to the Divine Heavens. You’ll soar through each cultivation realm without even realizing it, making your current achievements look neglectable.

"Un." Zhang Xiu Ying nodded, feeling hopeful for the future.

Sometime later, Su Yang began giving Zhang Xiu Ying more advice regarding her refined technique before going into the bedroom with her.

After a great session of dual cultivation, Su Yang left Zhang Xiu Ying’s place and continued onto the next disciple’s house until he finished all of his appointments for that day.

Time passed quickly, and it was already almost time for Xie Xingfang’s delivery before most people even realized.

"Su Yang, Sister Xingfang’s delivery should be coming up soon, right?" Zhu Mengyi asked him after their cultivation session.

Su Yang nodded and said, "Yes, she’ll give birth in a week. I’ll be heading to the Xie Family tomorrow just in case anything happens."

"Do you think I can be there when you do it?" Zhu Mnegyi then asked.

"Yes." Su Yang agreed without any hesitation.

And he continued, "I’ll see if the others want to be there as well. After all, it’s a special occasion for the family."

"That sounds great. Sister Xingfang is giving birth to twins, right? I wonder how it differs compared to my experience. It’ll definitely be more painful, right? Since she’s giving birth to two instead of one."

"If the doctor is skillful enough, they can finish the delivery without the women feeling any pain at all," said Su Yang.

"Really? It was quite painful for me when I gave birth to Zhu Jiayi. That doctor who helped me deliver was one of the top doctors in the Holy Central Continent too. Are you saying that she’s not a good doctor?"

Su Yang shook his head and said, "I didn’t say that. It takes more than just skills to deliver without pain, after all."

"So it’s a technique? I didn’t know there are such techniques out there." Zhu Mengyi mumbled.

"There are a lot of niche techniques out there meant for ordinary things besides cultivation. Of course, not many cultivators realize this since they’re always looking for the strongest cultivation techniques." Su Yang said.
