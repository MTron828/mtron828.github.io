Chapter 670 - Conquering Lian Li

Seeing Wu Jian’s puzzled face, Su Yang spoke in a slow but clear voice, "In this vast and seemingly endless universe, there exist multiple worlds, and the world we are currently in is only a tiny world compared to the other worlds that exist beyond the starry sky, and I am someone who came from those worlds."

Su Yang did not even bother explaining to Wu Jiang about his reincarnation and made it seem as though he’d come from the starry night.

"Another world from beyond the starry sky...?" Wu Jiang stared at him with a gawking expression and his jaw dropped.

"That’s right. I mentioned that I am referred to as Spirit Heaven’s Sword Emperor by some people, right? Well, Spirit Heaven is where I am from, and it exists somewhere in the starry night."

"..."

After a long moment of silence, Wu Jiang silently stood up and walked to the window before staring at the darkened sky with an unfathomable expression on his face.

Sometime later, he turned to look at Su Yang and spoke in a low voice, "And you... You plan on taking Jingjing with you back to your own world?"

"Yes," Su Yang nodded without hesitation.

"Haaaaa..."

Wu Jiang released a long sigh before mumbling, "It appears that I have suffered not one but two major losses today..."

"Father..." Wu Jingjing looked at him with a heartfelt gaze.

"You don’t have to say anything to me, Jingjing. I knew that you wouldn’t be at my side forever, but I didn’t expect you to leave this quickly," Wu Jiang said to her.

Wu Jiang then returned his focus to Su Yang, "I will only allow Wu Jingjing to follow you if you can promise me one thing— that you will protect her and Wu Min no matter what— even at the cost of your own life. If you cannot do that, then you will have to walk over my dead body before you can take her with you."

Hearing his threatening voice that wasn’t very threatening at all, Su Yang laughed, "Are you looking down on me? I don’t need anyone to tell me to protect my own women!"

Wu Jiang did not find any offense in his words and nodded with a resolute look on his face, "Good! Then I shall entrust my daughter to you!"

"Su Yang let’s go to my living quarter for now," Wu Jingjing said to him after their business with Wu Jiang was finished.

Sometime later, Su Yang entered her room while Wu Jingjing went to put Wu Min to sleep, as it was getting late and she was nearly asleep by the time they returned home.

Once Wu Min was sound asleep, Wu Jingjing returned to Su Yang’s side.

"Are you really trying to court Her Highness, Lian Li? Even after you humiliated her in public? Do you think you still have a chance with her?" Wu Jingjing asked him, not bothered by the fact that he was trying to court another woman in her presence, as she understood that was his nature.

"What do you think? Do you think I will be able to court her successfully after everything that has happened today?" he asked her.

"Hmm..." Wu Jingjing immediately began pondering with a serious expression on her face.

A moment later, she spoke in a low voice, "Her Highness... She’s a difficult person to understand and impossible to predict. I don’t know what she’s thinking most of the time. However, I do know that she’s incredibly dedicated to swords and that she doesn’t like being around men."

"Is that so?" Su Yang nodded with a profound look on his face.

"But I think that’s because she doesn’t have much experience with men because of her status, as most men don’t even dare to approach her, much less court her. In fact, you are the first person I have witnessed courting her."

"Though, I have a feeling that you’ll be able to woo her," she chuckled and continued, "After all, you have this irresistible charm."

"You are making me blush," Su Yang said with a calm smile.

"Su Yang, why don’t we have a bet?" Wu Jingjing suddenly said.

"Oh? You wanna gamble with me? Just so you know, I have never lost a bet in my life," he said with a prideful look on his face.

"You know the saying ’there’s always a first time to everything’?"

"Of course, but the word ’impossible’ also exists," he said with a smile.

"Hmph! We shall see about that!"

"Anyway, what do you want to bet on?" Su Yang asked her a moment later. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

"Let’s bet on how long it’ll take you to conquer Her Highness’s maiden heart," Wu Jingjing said with a grin on her face.

"How long will it take me to court her, huh?"

Wu Jingjing nodded and continued, "I will consider it a successful conquest if you managed to have s.e.x with her. So how long do you think it’ll take you to conquer her?"

"..."

After a long moment of silence, he spoke with a confident look on his face, "It will happen before I have to meet with Emperor Lian."

"That fast?!" Wu Jingjing looked at him with wide eyes. "That’s in two days counting today! You think you’ll be able to conquer both her heart and body before tomorrow ends?"

"You think I can’t?"

"Nobody would!" she quickly said. "Not only did you spit on the Lian Family and beat her younger brother today but you also humiliated her in such a fashion before thousands of people! I bet she’s still angry at you right now! If you think you can court her in such a short time despite your disadvantages, I would like to see it with my very eyes!"

"Disadvantage?" A mysterious smile appeared on Su Yang’s face, and he said, "Very well, I shall do my best to not disappoint you."

Meanwhile, inside Lian Li’s living quarters, she stared at the red-colored medicine in her hands with a malicious smile on her face, "Just you wait, you damn pervert! I’ll have my revenge on you soon!"
