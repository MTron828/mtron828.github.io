764 Give Birth?

At this moment, Qiao Nian’s phone rang. She glanced at it and saw that it was her student, so she picked up the call. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Teacher Qiao, I’m already at the entrance of the villa. Are you there now?”

“Wait for me. I’ll give it to you now.” As Qiao Nian spoke, she walked towards the living room.

Previously, Qiao Nian had already packed Gu Qi and Xiao Shi’s nails into two folders and placed them on the table in the living room. She walked to the living room to pick up the folder and walked out. She saw her student standing at the door.

Qiao Nian handed the folder to her and said seriously, “Go to a private paternity test center and do a DNA test on these two samples. Remember, don’t go to the largest one.”

Although Qiao Nian’s student didn’t understand what she meant, he didn’t ask further. He nodded obediently and got back to work.

After Qiao Nian watched the student leave, she turned around and entered the villa.

If her student sent the sample to the largest paternity test center, it wouldn’t be long before Gu Zhou knew about this.

For safety’s sake, she could only get her student to do the DNA test elsewhere.

After sending the student off, Qiao Nian returned to the kitchen again. At this moment, the ribs in the pot were cooked. She hurriedly scooped them out, added some ingredients, and began to stew the ribs soup.

While the pork ribs soup was simmering, Qiao Nian steamed some rice and made two dishes. After she was done, Qiao Nian was about to go upstairs and call the children down for dinner when she suddenly remembered that Gu Zhou still didn’t know about Xiao Shi.

If Gu Zhou knew that he still had a daughter, would it agitate him? What if his other personalities came out?

It seemed that she should give Gu Zhou a heads-up in advance.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian took out her phone and called Gu Zhou.

At this moment, in the Gu family’s study.

Gu Zhou sat in front of his desk, his hand gently stroking the little snake. He was still thinking about how Qiao Nian had just left.

She seemed to be really avoiding him.

Why?

Could it be that he had frightened Qiao Nian?

At the thought of this, Gu Zhou frowned and pursed his thin lips.

At this moment, his phone suddenly rang.

He glanced at the phone screen indifferently. When he saw the words “Qiao Nian” on the screen, his eyes lit up, and his lips curved up involuntarily.

He took the phone and answered, pretending to be calm. “What’s wrong?”

Gu Zhou’s voice was as low, hoarse, and magnetic as ever. One could get pregnant just by listening to it.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but feel nervous. For some reason, she recalled Gu Zhou kissing her yesterday, and the tips of her ears turned red.

She hurriedly pushed all the messy thoughts in her mind to the back of her mind and said, “I’ll have lunch with Xiao Qi today. Don’t wait for me.”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, his thin lips curved up slightly and his eyes were filled with joy. It seemed that Qiao Nian had already begun to accept him.

Gu Zhou’s heart, which had been in his throat, gradually settled back down. He replied, “Okay.”

Gu Zhou had thought that Qiao Nian would say more, but there was no movement on the other end of the line. He hesitated for a moment and asked worriedly, “Did something happen?”

“I’m fine.” After saying that, Qiao Nian yearned to slap herself. She hurriedly added, “I just think Xiao Qi is a little too lonely.”

The phone stopped for a long time, but Qiao Nian didn’t hear Gu Zhou’s voice. Thinking that Gu Zhou had hung up, she glanced at her phone. The call was still connected. She asked, “Don’t you think Xiao Qi is a little lonely alone?”

“What are you getting at?”

“I think it would be great if Xiao Qi had a sister!”

“So Mrs. Gu, are you so eager to give birth to my child?”

On the other end of the line, Gu Zhou’s voice carried a hint of a smile and laziness, as well as a hint of joy. It was as if she couldn’t wait to have a child with him.

Qiao Nian felt terrible.

She had never expected Gu Zhou to misunderstand. She hurriedly said, “No, you’ve misunderstood. That’s not what I meant.”
