913 Great-grandmother

Qiao Nian looked down at Xiao Shi and patted her head. She bent down and picked her up, gently stroking her back.

“Mommy!”

Xiao Shi’s gentle voice entered her ears.

“Hm?”

“Let’s go home!”

Xiao Shi’s voice sounded exceptionally happy. Qiao Nian couldn’t help but feel happy. She carried Xiao Shi and spun her around twice before stopping. “Alright, let’s go home!”

“Who are you? Give me my great-granddaughter back!” An old woman with white hair and a face full of wrinkles walked over in a hurry, stepping forward to snatch Xiao Shi.

Qiao Nian immediately put Xiao Shi down and shielded her behind her. Only then did she notice that the old lady was alone. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Madam, are you mistaken? This is my daughter, not your great-granddaughter!” With that, Qiao Nian was about to leave with the two children when the old woman’s words made her stop involuntarily.

“Xiao Shi, it’s Great-Grandma. Great-Grandma misses you. Why did you only come to see Great-Grandma now?” When the old lady said this, her eyes were red-rimmed. She reached out to hug Xiao Shi, but just as she reached out, she saw two identical children. “Oh my god, my granddaughter actually gave birth to a pair of twins. My poor granddaughter. How can she hide such a big thing from me? This silly child!”

Tears immediately streamed down the old lady’s face. She reached out to grab Xiao Shi and Gu Qi’s hands.

Qiao Nian quickly shielded Xiao Shi and Gu Qi behind her. If she wasn’t wrong, the person in front of her should be Song Man’s grandmother.

Since Song Man’s grandmother had appeared, it meant that her family was also nearby.

She looked down at Xiao Shi and saw that she was looking at the old lady in surprise. She was worried that Xiao Shi would soften and leave with the old lady.

She couldn’t be bothered to look for Song Man’s family. She pulled the two children back.

Xiao Shi followed Qiao Nian back and turned to look at the old woman.

“Xiao Shi, Xiao Shi, my darling, come back quickly!” The old lady jogged after her and grabbed Xiao Shi’s hand, crying until her nose was covered in snot and tears. “My good child, don’t leave. Great-grandmother will take good care of you in the future!”

Xiao Shi was stunned. She reached out to push the old woman away, but she was much weaker. “Let go of me!”

Qiao Nian shielded Gu Qi behind her and stepped forward, wanting to separate the old lady from Xiao Shi. She didn’t expect the old lady to hug Xiao Shi so tightly. She was afraid that she would hurt Xiao Shi. Moreover, she was too embarrassed to hit an old lady hard.

“Madam, please let go of my child. If you’re here, I’ll have to call the police!” Qiao Nian said righteously, taking her phone out of her pocket.

“Then call the police. What right do you have to take my granddaughter’s child away!” The old woman wiped her tears and said angrily, “You stole my granddaughter’s child. You’re a human trafficker!”

Qiao Nian took out her phone, too lazy to speak to the old woman. At this moment, a young woman in a nurse’s uniform ran over from afar.

“I’m Hu Lin, Grandma Wang’s nurse.” A gentle smile appeared on Hu Lin’s face as she explained patiently, “Miss, I’m really sorry. There’s something wrong with Grandma Wang. Please don’t stoop to her level.”

As Hu Lin spoke, she pointed at her head and glanced at Wang Yue.

Qiao Nian frowned slightly and said, “Miss Hu, I have other things to do at home. I’m going back, but Madam Wang is pestering my child now. My child is also frightened.”

Hu Lin hurriedly bent down and apologized. Then, she walked over to Wang Yue and whispered into her ear. Wang Yue immediately let go of Xiao Shi and looked at Hu Lin in a daze.

Hu Lin smiled at Qiao Nian. Her gaze fell on Xiao Shi’s face and she apologized sincerely. “I’m sorry, I’m really sorry. I apologize on behalf of Grandma Wang. Grandma Wang’s only granddaughter is gone. She can’t accept it for a while.”

“It’s fine. It’s indeed very easy to be affected by the departure of a relative.” Seeing that Xiao Shi’s expression was still fine, Qiao Nian said casually.
