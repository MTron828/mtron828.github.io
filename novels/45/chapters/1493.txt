1494 Sadness

Lina couldn’t finish her sentence. She really hoped that her mother would recover. She didn’t want her mother to be like this.

Lina stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian’s face, her eyes filled with anticipation. Qiao Nian wouldn’t say such a thing without full confidence. Could her mother really recover?

Even if her mother couldn’t recover to a normal state, it was fine as long as she was better than her current situation.

Seeing that Lina was stunned, Qiao Nian smiled and continued, “Don’t be too nervous. Your state might affect Madam’s state. Maintain a good mental state. If your mother’s mood improves, the treatment will be twice as effective. I’ll walk around with you.”

Qiao Nian thought that she could ask about Madam President later.

“Okay.” Lina sniffled, trying hard to compose herself. Her eyes were filled with gratitude for Qiao Nian.

The European palace was very large. Some of the buildings were connected by a garden.

There were many expensive plants in the garden. Qiao Nian asked about Madam President in a low voice. Lina told her everything she knew.

Gu Zhou walked to the rockery at the side. His gaze passed by the flowing stream and finally landed on Qiao Nian, who was in the small garden opposite. His eyes couldn’t help but soften.

On the other side, when the president walked to the living room, he saw that it was empty.

The president’s expression instantly darkened. He turned to look at the guard beside him and asked in a low voice, “Where’s Annie?”

When the patrolling guard, who had been standing beside the living room, heard the president’s question, his face suddenly turned pale. He said in fear, “I saw Princess Annie go in with my own eyes. I don’t know what happened after that.”

The patrolling guard became nervous. He didn’t understand. Princess Annie had clearly entered the living room. Why had she disappeared?

The guard lowered his head, his heart in his throat. The president must be very angry now.

The President stood there with a sinister expression, his eyes narrowing slightly. Every time Annie came to the palace, it was for that matter.

He glanced in the direction of Madam President’s room and said with a dark expression, “Hurry up and find her!”

“Yes!” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Soon, the guards dispersed.

Annie had been waiting in the living room for about fifteen minutes. Seeing that the president had not arrived for a long time, she grew impatient.

In terms of birthright, the president should be her father, not Second Uncle.

It was unknown what method Second Uncle had used back then to get his grandfather to pass the throne to him, causing his father to be mocked by everyone for a long time.

Someone who had used dirty methods to snatch the throne actually dared to put on airs in front of her.

However, what puzzled her was that there were many troops in the palace today. She had almost been discovered by those people.

Annie was about to go to Madam President’s room when she accidentally passed by a stream. From afar, she saw a man standing there.

Sunlight fell on the sparkling stream, and fragments of sunlight enveloped the man. Annie looked at the side profile of the oriental-faced man, and she was so nervous that she felt a little suffocated.

This man was more fascinating than any man she had ever seen, especially his eyes. They were distant and deep. Just by looking at them, she couldn’t help but want to sink into them.

He seemed to like the sparkling stream and was staring unblinkingly at it.

All the displeasure in Annie’s heart instantly disappeared. Her lips curved up involuntarily. She tidied her clothes briefly before walking towards the man with a bright smile.
