1406 Strange

“Who told you that Grandpa asked the chauffeur to kill your wife?” Qiao Nian asked calmly, standing not far away and staring unblinkingly at Uncle Zhao.

“You want to get information out of me? Let me tell you, you’re still too young. You weren’t even born when I fought on the battlefield back then!” Uncle Zhao’s eyes were filled with anger. He yearned to kill everyone in the Lu family. The Lu family was simply a monster who killed without batting an eyelid. He had worked hard for the Lu family for his entire life, but in the end, it was just a joke.

“Uncle Zhao, calm down first.” Qiao Nian realized that Uncle Zhao was angry. She was worried that Uncle Zhao would be too agitated and wake up the hypnotic worm in his body. She asked, “You keep saying that your wife is having an affair. Then when your wife first found out that she was pregnant, why didn’t you ask her to abort the child?”

When Uncle Zhao heard Qiao Nian’s words, a trace of confusion flashed in his eyes. He subconsciously said, “That’s because…”

Uncle Zhao frowned. Then, he said, “I didn’t know that she was having an affair. I only know now that she was.”

“Who told you that your wife was having an affair?” Qiao Nian looked at Uncle Zhao seriously and asked calmly.

“Of course it’s…” Before Uncle Zhao could finish speaking, his mind was in a mess. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

In his memory, his relationship with his wife was broken. There was an endless fight every day. “No, I knew in the past that she had betrayed me. She clearly…”

Uncle Zhao could not continue speaking because a pile of new memories suddenly appeared in his mind. They were all of his wife, Wen Ya, waiting for him to return home.

Strange.

Why were there two different memories?

Uncle Zhao’s frown deepened. Seeing that Uncle Zhao was already beginning to doubt his own memories, Qiao Nian asked, “Who told you that your wife was having an affair?”

“I…” Uncle Zhao’s frown deepened. After thinking for a long time, he said hesitantly, “I don’t know.”

Matriarch Lu, who was sitting not far away, looked at Uncle Zhao’s timid expression. Although her voice was weathered, her tone was very dignified. “Old Zhao, when Old Master was still alive, he always returned home. He never went to your house at all. Who doesn’t know that the person he loves the most is me? I’m the person he adores the most. It’s impossible for him to have an affair. Who exactly told you that he was having an affair with your wife? Tell me, we’ll bring him over to confront you!”

Towards the end, Matriarch Lu’s frown deepened. With a disappointed expression, she said, “You’re his personal guard and have always been by his side. You’ve been by his side for more than forty years, and you’re still doubting his character? You have to know that everyone in An City knows that Old Master is gentle, kind, and tolerant!”

Matriarch Lu’s words seemed to have opened a door. When that door opened, some memories that had been locked behind it surged out.

Uncle Zhao frowned in pain. He bit his lower lip. When he finished accepting those memories, he was stunned.

Why?

Why did he have two different memories?

In his new memory, Old Master Lu was a tolerant person. At that time, he was impressed by Old Master Lu’s character, so he had always been by his side.

There was indeed such a thing as his wife being in a car accident. At that time, the chauffeur who caused the accident kept shouting that he was innocent. When he was taken away by the police, he even cried and said that he didn’t kill anyone on purpose!

Although Old Master Lu was tolerant of people, he would never be soft-hearted to his enemies. It could even be said that he was cruel.

At that time, he only knew that his wife was dead and that the child in her stomach was gone. It was a baby boy who had already taken shape.

Later on, the chauffeur who caused the accident went to jail.

Seeing that Uncle Zhao was in a daze, Matriarch Lu said coldly, “What exactly are you thinking!”

When Uncle Zhao heard Matriarch Lu’s voice, he subconsciously looked up at her.

Matriarch Lu was so angry that she was panting heavily. She said angrily, “At that time, the driver with the surname Wei was in a car accident because he was drunk. He reeked of alcohol. When he knelt in front of you and apologized, didn’t you smell the alcohol on him?”
