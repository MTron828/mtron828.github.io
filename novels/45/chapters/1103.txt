1104 Clues

“Yes, and you saw her die in childbirth with your own eyes. That means that she really gave birth.” Qiao Nian nodded in agreement.

Qin Chuan had also investigated Gu Qi’s identity before and knew about Wang Lin. He gripped the coffee cup in his hand tightly and said with a serious expression, “What role does Wang Lin play here? Is she the unlucky chosen one, or did they plan to make her pregnant from the beginning?”

Previously, Gu Zhou had briefly investigated Wang Lin. No one knew who Wang Lin’s man was. Everyone only knew that when Wang Lin returned home, her stomach had already grown big.

At the thought of this, Gu Zhou’s eyes darkened. He said in a low voice, “Looks like we have to investigate the Wang family carefully.”

!!

Qiao Nian said in agreement, “We should start with Wang Lin’s family and the father of the child in her stomach. We might be able to find more information. We might even be able to find our child.”

Qin Chuan was confused. He asked in surprise, “Haven’t you already found the children?”

He still remembered how happy Qiao Nian had looked when she found Gu Qi and Xiao Shi. She had been going on about at him for an hour.

Qin Chuan’s expression changed drastically. He asked worriedly, “Could your child have been kidnapped?”

“No.” Qiao Nian shook her head and explained, “I just remembered that I was pregnant with triplets back then. Now, I’ve only found Gu Qi and Xiao Shi. In other words, there’s another child wandering outside.”

“Triplets?” Qin Chuan was a little stunned!

“Yes.” Qiao Nian nodded and said, “I also recalled that when I took my pulse in the past, I realized that I was pregnant with triplets. I was worried that my memory was wrong, so I specially asked Su Xue and Qiao Xin. They saw the three dead babies I gave birth to with their own eyes.”

As soon as Qiao Nian finished speaking, she felt that things were a little chaotic. She frowned at Qin Chuan, then at Gu Zhou. “Let me sort out the clues I’ve obtained.”

Qin Chuan frowned worriedly.

“At that time, Su Xue and Qiao Xin found out that I had given birth, so they rushed to the mental hospital. They saw the three dead babies on my bed.” After Qiao Nian finished speaking, she looked up at Qin Chuan, her voice trembling. “When you saw me, there were only two dead babies left by my side. Where did the other dead baby go?”

Qin Chuan was shocked. His hands under the table were clenched into fists, his eyes filled with disbelief. “Are you saying that another child was taken away during this period?”

“Yes.” Qiao Nian nodded. “I remember in a daze that I fainted after giving birth. When I woke up, I saw two dead babies. I was carrying one of them and was so sad that I wanted to die.”

“When Su Xue and Qiao Xin went to your ward, you were still unconscious,” Gu Zhou said thoughtfully.

“I think so.” Qiao Nian nodded and pursed her lips. “Where were the doctors and nurses who delivered my children back then?” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“I don’t know.” Qin Chuan’s eyes were filled with guilt, and his voice was filled with regret. “When I went to look for you, you were alone. I’ve also investigated the doctor and nurses who delivered your child, but I couldn’t find who they were. There was something wrong with the hospital’s surveillance system that night.”

“It’s all my fault. If I had been by your side at that time, so many things wouldn’t have happened after you gave birth.” Qin Chuan was filled with regret. He frowned.

Six years ago, he was only twelve years old and clueless. He was also at a relatively inexperienced age.

August 15th was the darkest day of his life.

Sister Nian had lost her innocence and everything had been ruined. Later on, he received news that his grandfather had gone missing. Before he could recover, he found out that Eldest Senior Brother had gone missing.

One thing after another happened. There was a huge rock pressing down on his chest, suffocating him.

The three most important people in his life had all met with an accident. He couldn’t take the blow for a moment and was dispirited for a long time.

At that time, Sister Nian had been locked up in a mental hospital. He often visited her. When he found out that she was pregnant, his heart seemed to be empty.

His pure and flawless Sister Nian was pregnant with a stranger’s children. He subconsciously wanted Sister Nian to abort the children.
