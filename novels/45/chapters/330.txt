Chapter 331: Crying

He had long since decided not to serve Lu Nian.

Hence, he wanted to sign Qiao Nian, this beautiful young lady. Firstly, Qiao Nian was indeed good at the violin. Secondly, her personality was also likable.

If Qiao Nian debuted, it wouldn’t be long before she caught up to Lu Nian.

At this moment, the sound of a piano came from the stage.

Qiao Nian and Brother Cao both sat down.

The soothing music made one relax. Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Lu Nian’s side profile.

He had a high nose bridge and a slight hunchback. His side profile was well-defined, just like a Western man’s deep-set features, but not lacking in the handsomeness of an Asian man.

Qiao Nian looked at Lu Nian’s side profile. For some reason, she had a strange feeling, as if she had heard the song before, or seen Lu Nian playing the piano for her.

Suddenly, a strange image flashed across her mind.

In the video, a young man in white was sitting next to the piano, playing this song. His warm and doting voice made her involuntarily lose herself in it.

She had dreamed of this scene more than once, so she had a deep impression of it.

When the song ended, everyone who heard it applauded. Everyone had a different feeling. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Lu Zhu and Lu Qi were the most touched. Lu Qi’s eyes were red-rimmed. She knew that this song had been specially composed by Second Brother for his biological sister when he was young.

He had heard from Second Brother that his sister was very talented in music. Although she didn’t know how to play the piano, she was very good at listening. She would always smile sweetly at beautiful songs.

Second Brother had always felt that he and his sister had written this song together.

It seemed that Second Brother still missed his sister.

Lu Qi wiped her tears with a tissue. It seemed that Second Brother regretted not coming back on the anniversary of his sister’s death.

Lu Zhu felt terrible as well. In the past, he had always felt that this song was warm and cheerful, but today, he felt a trace of sadness.

Song Yu took out a tissue and wiped Lu Qi’s tears. She said dotingly, “You’ve grown up. Don’t cry so easily!”

“Sister Xiaoyu, I heard from Mom that Second Brother spent the most time with Sister in the past. I think he must be feeling terrible. That’s why he changed the song today!”

Song Yu was slightly stunned when she heard Lu Qi’s words.

For so many years, Lu Qi had always called her Sister Xiaoyu, but Lu Qi had never called her by her full name.

Actually, she could understand.

She had lived in the Lu family for so many years and had seen with her own eyes how much everyone in the Lu family cared about the eldest daughter of the Lu family. Even after so many years, her mother had yet to recover from her sorrow.

Moreover, in the hearts of the Lu family, family was the most important.

It was also because of this that she had never suffered any grievances in the Lu family. She was like a little princess.

Sometimes, Song Yu thought that if the eldest daughter of the Lu family was still alive, she would definitely be the most doted on.

During his five minute break, Lu Nian walked off the stage. He accidentally saw that Qiao Nian’s eyes were red. He frowned slightly. “What’s wrong with your eyes?”

Qiao Nian looked up at Lu Nian and said in a low voice, “This song touched me deeply. I couldn’t help but recall some of the past.”

This was the first time Lu Nian had seen Qiao Nian with a red nose. It seemed that her feelings were extraordinary. In his memory, Qiao Nian was always calm and composed.

“Will you be able to go on stage later?” Lu Nian asked with concern.

Qiao Nian nodded without hesitation. “No problem.”

Brother Cao made room for Lu Nian, who was sitting at the side.

“Do you think this song is bad?” Lu Nian asked.

“No…” Qiao Nian shook her head. Her gaze fell on Lu Nian’s face, and she inadvertently recalled the young man in white. At this moment, Lu Nian’s face overlapped with the young man’s.
