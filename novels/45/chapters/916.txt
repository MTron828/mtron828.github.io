917 Giving a Gift

“Brother, I understand. I’ll protect myself!” Qiao Nian nodded in agreement. Suddenly, a trace of hesitation flashed in her eyes. “Brother, those people already know that I’m still alive, and they all know who I am. In that case, I don’t have to hide it anymore. When the time comes, make arrangements. I want to see Mom and Dad. Perhaps we can find clues through their memories!”

Qiao Nian hadn’t wanted to alert the enemy, but now she realized that those people all knew who she was. Moreover, those people also knew that she was still alive. There was no need for her to hide anymore.

“Yes. In the past, every time I asked Mother about helping you test your sample, she would have a headache and feel unwell. Sometimes, she would even faint. If she knew that you were still alive, she would definitely be very happy. She would definitely help us recall what happened back then. When we get back, I’ll let you reunite with your fourth brother. He still doesn’t know that you’re alive!”

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Zhu’s words, she paused for a moment and swallowed hard. “Brother, are you saying that I have a fourth brother?”

!!

Jesus.

Why did she have so many brothers?

That wasn’t right.

How many brothers did she have?

Qiao Nian pursed her lips and asked carefully, “Brother, is Fourth Brother also my biological brother?”

“Yes!”

“Then how many brothers do I have?”

Qiao Nian felt that her parents were really good at giving birth.

When Lu Zhu heard Qiao Nian’s question, he couldn’t help but laugh. He said, “Your Third Brother, Fourth Brother, and you are triplets!”

“Triplets?”

At this moment, Qiao Nian finally understood why she could give birth to twins. It turned out that there was a gene in the family that favored the formation of twins!

“Yes, at that time, you were the youngest of the triplets. After that, you were especially indignant. You often fought with Third Brother and Fourth Brother and insisted that they call you Sister. When you couldn’t win, you even cried!” Lu Zhu recalled what had happened when he was young. His eyes gradually became gentle, and there was a smile on his lips.

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Zhu’s words, she couldn’t help but laugh. It was indeed something she could do. She had never admitted defeat.

When Lu Zhu heard Qiao Nian’s laughter, his heart couldn’t help but ache for her. It was rare for him to hear Qiao Nian laugh so happily.

“Sugar, actually, you don’t have to put on a brave front alone. Everyone is by your side, and everyone will help you. If it’s the truth, we’ll investigate it slowly. There’s no need to be conflicted about the truth. Everyone wants you to live happily!”

Qiao Nian was very touched. Smiling, she said, “Brother, I understand!”

After Qiao Nian hung up, she recalled what Lu Zhu had just said and fell into deep thought.

In the past, she had always been tense. Even when she slept, she had nightmares. She had never relaxed.

There were many people around her who cared about her now, and they would all protect her. There was no need for her to hold on alone. She had to try to trust others.

As Qiao Nian thought about this, her phone suddenly rang. Her alarm clock was giving her a reminder.

She was preparing a gift for Qiao Xin, so she had set a time in advance.

Qiao Nian called Qiao Xin directly. The call went through very quickly.

Qiao Xin was undergoing a beauty treatment. When she saw Qiao Nian’s call, a trace of surprise flashed in her eyes. She asked tentatively, “Sister? Why do you have the time to call me? Is something the matter?”

“Of course I have a gift for you. Are you free tonight? Can you come out for a while?” Qiao Nian said with a fake smile.

Qiao Xin was even more surprised. For some reason, she had a bad feeling about this.

Qiao Nian hated her very much. Now, she had actually taken the initiative to call her and even said that she had a gift for her.

Qiao Xin felt a chill run down her spine. She felt that Qiao Nian was a weasel wishing a chicken a happy new year. She had ill intentions.

“You—”

Before Qiao Xin could finish speaking, Qiao Nian hung up, not giving Qiao Xin a chance to refuse.

Qiao Xin had just finished her beauty treatments. After paying the bill, she walked towards the parking lot.

When she reached the parking lot, she took out her phone and called Qiao Yu. “Brother, I’m out. Where are you in the parking lot?”
