1388 Probe

When Lu Zhu heard Matriarch Lu’s words, he asked, “Grandma, Uncle Zhao has no family in his life, right…”

Lu Zhu did not make it clear directly. The matter of the traitor was very important. If he did not get rid of the traitor, the other members of the Lu family might be hurt. He did not want Grandma to blindly trust Uncle Zhao just because he had been staying at home for a long time.

Moreover, Uncle Zhao only had to say that Qi Qi wasn’t at home for dinner. Why did he have to talk about it so openly?

The more one tried to hide it, the more obvious it would be. One really couldn’t help but be suspicious.

Lu Nian’s mind raced, and he quickly made up his mind. “How about this? I’ll test Uncle Zhao and see what his attitude is.”

Actually, Su Yan still agreed with Matriarch Lu. She didn’t think that the traitor was Uncle Zhao, but now, they had to prove that Uncle Zhao wasn’t behind this. “Be careful.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Lu Nian nodded and walked out.

Su Yan watched as Lu Nian left, her frown deepening. She looked at Matriarch Lu worriedly.

Matriarch Lu sighed helplessly and said, “Sigh.”

Lu Nian walked out and saw Uncle Zhao walking in anxiously, carrying chicken, fish, and a piece of pork ribs.

When Uncle Zhao saw Lu Nian, his face was filled with anxiety. He quickly walked up to Lu Nian and asked anxiously, “Second Young Master, how is Little Miss now? Has she returned?”

Lu Nian sighed heavily and said softly, “She was hit in the head by a stone and has been unconscious. The doctor doesn’t know when she’ll wake up.”

Uncle Zhao looked down at the thing in his hand and said with a disappointed expression, “I wanted to make soup for Young Miss to nourish her body…”

As Uncle Zhao spoke, his tone grew softer and softer. He frowned, and the wrinkles on his face deepened because of the melancholy.

Lu Nian could only see his sadness on Uncle Zhao’s face. He hoped that that person was not Uncle Zhao. He sighed and said, “Uncle Zhao, Qi Qi will definitely wake up. When she wakes up, we’ll make soup for her!”

“Yes.” Uncle Zhao still looked tired. He said in a low voice, “I hope she recovers soon.

Uncle Zhao carried his things and walked towards the backyard. When he met other servants, he left dejectedly without greeting them.

When Gu Zhou came out of the living room, he saw Uncle Zhao leaving. His phoenix-like eyes narrowed slightly.

A man who had never married or had a child?

No matter how one looked at it, it was strange.

When Lu Nian saw Gu Zhou, he walked towards him. Seeing Gu Zhou looking at Uncle Zhao’s back with a complicated expression, he said in a low voice, “I didn’t see any flaws just now.”

Gu Zhou retracted his gaze and looked at Lu Nian curiously. “Uncle Zhao has never gotten married and had children?”

Lu Nian looked around. There was no one else around, so he lowered his voice and said, “I heard from someone that Uncle Zhao once had a wife he loved deeply. When his wife was pregnant, she had a car accident. Uncle Zhao never married again.”

Gu Zhou nodded slightly and said in a low voice, “But still investigate carefully to see who spread the news.”

“Yes.”

…

In the living room of a villa in the suburbs, the latest news was on the television.

“The latest news from this station is being reported. The Wang Village Tunnel has been searched and people have been rescued by the police fire department. Sixty victims have already been rescued and sent to the hospital. Ten more victims have died. Four more victims are missing. The police are still searching and verifying identities.”

The middle-aged man looked at the report on the television sinisterly. Frustrated, he picked up the remote control and turned it off. He looked at the four of them coldly and questioned angrily, “I asked you to capture Lu Qi, but you actually blew up the Wang Village Tunnel. Do you want the world to be in chaos?”

The leader lowered his head and apologized sincerely. “I’m sorry, Third Master. We didn’t want to alert the enemy. We wanted to wait until they got out of the car and there was no one around before taking action. We really didn’t expect there to be a group of people watching the target mission. They blew up the Wang Village Tunnel. They probably want to kill the target mission!”

The man called Third Master looked at the leader sharply and asked coldly, “Are you questioning my words?”

The leader hurriedly lowered his head guiltily.

The middle-aged man calmed himself down and continued, “She should have been sent to the hospital. This time, you have to bring her back safely!”

“Yes!”
