938 Did I Wrong You?

At this moment, Qiao Xin didn’t even think about whether she had broken the law by doing such a thing. All she could think about was the fact that Qiao Yu had hit her for Qiao Nian.

“Why? Did I wrong you?” Qiao Yu’s cold voice came out of his mouth. He had never thought that he would speak to his biological sister in such a voice.

Qiao Shan frowned and grabbed Qiao Yu’s arm. He said angrily, “Qiao Yu, how can you hit your biological sister for an outsider? Do you know what you’re doing?”

“I know very well what I’m doing. Besides,” Qiao Yu paused and enunciated each word clearly, “Qiao Nian has never been an outsider!”

He had never treated Qiao Nian as an outsider.

Hearing Qiao Yu’s words, Qiao Shan and Su Xue were both shocked.

Qiao Xin looked at Qiao Yu coldly. She saw Qiao Nian in the photo in Qiao Yu’s office.

Qiao Yu liked Qiao Nian!

Hence, Qiao Yu knew that he was going to ruin Qiao Nian today and deliberately came to slap her!

So in her brother’s eyes, Qiao Nian was so important.

“Brother, if you like Qiao Nian, just tell her directly. She won’t see you do this in front of me at all, and she won’t be grateful to you!” Qiao Xin said angrily, looking at Qiao Yu with a dark expression.

When Su Xue heard Qiao Xin’s words, she was slightly stunned. She looked at Qiao Yu in disbelief and stammered, “Qiao… Qiao Yu, do you like Qiao Nian?”

Qiao Shan didn’t care who Qiao Yu liked, but Qiao Yu had gone too far today. Qiao Xin had just come out of the operating theater and Qiao Yu slapped her!

“Qiao Yu, no matter what, you should apologize to your sister immediately. Your sister’s leg is injured. You’re the closest person to her. How can you hit her?” Qiao Shan said angrily.

“Apologize?” Qiao Yu looked at Qiao Shan coldly and said in a low voice, “Why should I apologize? We should apologize to Qiao Nian now!”

Apologize to Qiao Nian?

When Qiao Shan thought of what Qiao Nian had done, his head hurt. How could he apologize to someone like Qiao Nian?

“You unfilial son!” Qiao Shan was so angry that his face and neck turned red. He coughed violently twice before saying, “You’ve really grown up. Your wings have hardened. You don’t care about your family at all!” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Seeing that Qiao Shan’s expression was not right, Su Xue hurriedly ran up to him and smoothed his back. In a gentle voice, she advised, “Alright, don’t be angry. What if your health is affected? Qiao Yu is our son. Our son is insensible. We’ll teach him slowly!”

“I remember. Qiao Xin was obedient and kind when she was young,” Qiao Yu said in a low voice, looking at Qiao Xin’s face.

Qiao Shan and Su Xue didn’t know why Qiao Yu would say that. They looked at him in confusion.

“When she was young, she was like a little angel. She was smart, kind, and obedient. If she had the same qualities as when she was young, she would be an outstanding girl. But now…” As Qiao Yu spoke, his gaze fell on Qiao Shan and Su Xue’s faces, his eyes filled with disappointment. “Qiao Xin has already been ruined by you!”

“I’ve never changed. I’ve always been so good!” Qiao Xin said, raising her head. She was as outstanding as ever. She was still the school belle and the top student in school!

Su Xue glanced at Qiao Xin with a complicated expression, then her gaze fell on Qiao Yu’s face. Frowning, she asked in confusion, “What do you mean by that?”

Qiao Yu looked at Qiao Xin coldly, as if he was looking at a stranger. “When she realized that Qiao Nian was outstanding, she tried her best to hide her brilliance. She was just afraid that Qiao Nian was better than her.”

When Qiao Xin heard Qiao Yu’s words, her heart clenched.

“Later on, she realized that she couldn’t hide Qiao Nian’s excellence at all. She could only choose to destroy Qiao Nian!” Qiao Yu looked at Qiao Xin coldly and said resentfully, “Did I tell you that if you want to become outstanding, you have to work a hundred or a thousand times harder? There are very few geniuses in this world. Only by working hard can you climb to the position you want. What did you do? Do you think you can occupy the high ground just because you’ve blocked Qiao Nian’s light? Have you never thought that there are millions of Qiao Nian in this world, and you’ve never surpassed her? You’re just stuck in the same place, like a frog in a well. How pitiful!”
