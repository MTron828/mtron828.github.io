1193 Childish

Gu Zhou really hoped that they would be together forever.

Thank you readers!

With this thought in mind, Gu Zhou lowered his head and kissed Qiao Nian’s forehead. He hugged Qiao Nian tightly and slowly closed his eyes.

She should be able to sleep very peacefully today!

…

The next morning, when Qiao Nian woke up, there was no one around.

It seemed that Gu Zhou had woken up long ago. Qiao Nian got out of bed and glanced around the room. Gu Zhou must have left.

Today, there was a stone gambling banquet. Gu Zhou must have gone to help Fourth Brother.

Holding a towel, Qiao Nian walked towards the bathroom. She was about to brush her teeth when she inadvertently saw herself in the dressing mirror. Her skin was as white as snow, her cheeks were flushed, and her eyes were charming. It was obvious that she was a woman who had sex.

Everything that had happened last night flashed across Qiao Nian’s mind. She couldn’t help but blush. She hurriedly looked away and lowered her head to brush her teeth.

After brushing her teeth, she walked into the bathroom to take a shower. The crazy things she and Gu Zhou had done in the bathroom instantly surged into her mind.

She felt that she had been poisoned with a poison called “attraction to Gu Zhou”.

She had never believed in love in the past. She felt that men were all unreliable. In the past, when she was in the countryside, she was used to seeing men cheat and abuse women.

However, she understood that Gu Zhou was not that kind of person. When she was with Gu Zhou, she felt that bone-deep love.

After taking a shower, Qiao Nian put on pure makeup and wore a light blue dress. She left the room.

When the elevator reached the first floor, the door opened. Qiao Nian immediately saw Gu Zhou standing at the side. Thinking of what had happened last night, her heart couldn’t help but race.

Qiao Nian pretended to be calm as she walked out of the elevator.

Gu Zhou naturally wrapped his arm around Qiao Nian’s waist and kissed her forehead, praising, “Honey, you’re so beautiful!”

Although Gu Zhou had only kissed her forehead, Qiao Nian felt that everyone’s gaze was on her and Gu Zhou. The ambiguous images from last night instantly surged into her mind. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Qiao Nian lowered her head slightly and said softly, “We’re outside now. There are so many people watching. Be more reserved!”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, a trace of cunning flashed in his eyes. He said roguishly, “I just want them to see that you’re my wife. I want them to stop having designs on you, especially Jiang Chi!”

Gu Zhou’s tone was as domineering as ever.

When Jiang Chi walked over, he immediately saw Gu Zhou’s arm around Qiao Nian’s waist. His blue pupils constricted slightly, and his eyes were filled with displeasure.

For a moment, the two men’s gazes met. Lightning flashed and thunder rumbled!

Gu Zhou looked at Jiang Chi provocatively and raised his eyebrows slightly, as if to let him know his place.

Jiang Chi’s eyes instantly turned cold, but he quickly regained his composure. He looked away with disdain and quickly walked into the banquet hall.

Qiao Nian naturally noticed the exchange of glances between Gu Zhou and Jiang Chi. She pursed her lips helplessly. This was the first time she had seen such a childish Gu Zhou.

How old was he? Why was he still playing such a childish trick!

Chen Qing, who was standing at the side, looked like this was the first time he had seen Gu Zhou like this!

Second Young Master was so possessive.

However, he naturally couldn’t say such things in front of Gu Zhou. He immediately threw those indecent thoughts to the back of his mind and walked to Gu Zhou’s side, saying in a low voice, “Second Young Master and Second Young Madam, it’s about time to go to the banquet hall. Fourth Master Lu is already there.”

“Okay.” Gu Zhou agreed happily and led Qiao Nian towards the banquet hall.

Chen Qing followed silently behind Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian.

When they arrived at the banquet hall, Lu Jiang, who had been arranging for people to decorate the stone gambling banquet hall,’s eyes lit up when he saw Qiao Nian. He casually handed the tablet to Allen and asked him to decorate the place according to the blueprint while he walked towards Qiao Nian.

Just as Gu Zhou was about to walk over, Qiao Nian called out happily, “Fourth Brother!”

Lu Jiang’s gaze grew gentler. He said dotingly, “Sugar, how was your sleep last night?”

When Gu Zhou heard the words “last night”, those shy images flashed across his mind.
