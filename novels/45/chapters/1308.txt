1309 Brother Feng

Dao Wen stood there in a daze, still not understanding what had happened.

Qiao Nian looked at the ghost masked man in front of her coldly. She would never allow anyone to hurt Eldest Senior Brother.

When she was young, she was often bullied. At that time, Eldest Senior Brother would stand up to protect her.

Not only that, but Eldest Senior Brother had also tutored her in her homework, taught her martial arts, and taught her how to be a hacker.

In Qiao Nian’s mind, bits and pieces of her time with Eldest Senior Brother appeared. She looked at the ghost masked man with red-rimmed eyes.

This person actually dared to hurt Eldest Senior Brother!

She really wanted to kill that person directly, but when she thought about leaving him alive so that those people could admit Cui Huai’s crimes in the future, she aimed the gun at the ghost masked man’s leg and fired without hesitation.

However, his companion, who was standing beside the ghost masked man, blocked it in front of him.

The bullet pierced through the ghost masked man’s leg. The ghost masked man groaned in pain.

Ba Song did not expect Chang Feng to help him block the bullet. His eyes instantly turned red.

Not only did that scum, Dao Wen, tell Gu Zhou’s woman about their actions tonight, but he also wanted to capture them all.

Ba Song had been extremely sad because of Dao Wen’s betrayal. Now that Chang Feng had taken a bullet for him, his heart was filled with tears of gratitude.

Brother Feng was the real brother!

Ba Song supported Chang Feng and asked in a low voice, “Brother Feng, how are you now?”

When Qiao Nian heard Ba Song’s words, her pupils instantly dilated. She looked at the ghost masked man with an injured leg in disbelief.

What was going on?

Qiao Nian looked into the ghost masked man’s eyes and met those gentle eyes. That person’s eyes were filled with gentleness. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Qiao Nian’s heart trembled violently. She looked at the ghost masked man with red-rimmed eyes. Only then did she realize that she had mistaken him for someone else.

She actually didn’t recognize Eldest Senior Brother!

Qiao Nian was about to step forward and stop Chang Feng when she heard him say weakly to the ghost masked man beside him, “Ba Song, let’s leave quickly. Dao Wen has betrayed us. The mission has failed!”

At this moment, Qiao Nian understood why Chang Feng wasn’t wearing her grandfather’s pocket watch.

Eldest Senior Brother must have deliberately made that person be treated as a traitor. That way, Eldest Senior Brother would be safe.

Before Dao Wen could explain, he saw Qiao Nian running up to him nervously and asking anxiously, “Brother, are you alright? Are you injured?”

Dao Wen immediately took a step back and wanted to point the gun at Qiao Nian. Qiao Nian quickly inserted the silver needle into Dao Wen’s acupuncture points. Dao Wen could only speak and not move.

“You…”

Before Dao Wen could finish speaking, Qiao Nian interrupted him mercilessly. She glared at the two ghost masked men angrily and raised the gun in her hand. “Brother, don’t worry. I won’t let them run back and report us!”

Ba Song was so angry that his eyeballs were about to pop out. He looked at Dao Wen angrily and cursed, “Dao Wen, I was blind. I treated you as my brother, and you treated us as idiots to please women! Scum, being your brother is the biggest mistake of my life!”

As Ba Song spoke, he helped Chang Feng out.

At first, Dao Wen didn’t understand what had happened, but Ba Song’s words made him understand everything.

F*ck, how could he be Gu Zhou’s accomplice?

Today, he had received instructions to find evidence that Chang Feng was Gu Zhou’s accomplice and kill him!

However, he really didn’t react just now. He subconsciously wanted to follow them, but his body wouldn’t listen to him. No matter what, he couldn’t move.

F*ck, what the hell!

“I—”

“Brother, I know. You treat them as brothers, but they want to kill me. We have to strike first!” Qiao Nian interrupted Ba Song again. Seeing that Ba Song had brought Chang Feng out, she used a silver needle to seal Dao Wen’s mute acupoint.

She quickly walked to the door of the ward and looked at Ba Song and Chang Feng not far away. Her eyes were slightly red.

She knew very well that although Eldest Senior Brother was injured now, he would not be suspected when he returned.

Qiao Nian also understood that Eldest Senior Brother was doing this to return to Gu Yue’s side.

She took out her pistol and pretended to fire a few shots beside Ba Song and Chang Feng. None of them hit them.
