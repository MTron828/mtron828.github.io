Chapter 197: You Can Get a Divorce!

Qiao Xin panicked. She wanted to speak up for Qiao Shan, but the evidence was right there. She had no idea what to do to help Qiao Shan get out of this crisis.

Gu Zhou turned to look at Su Xue and Qiu Nan and asked calmly, “Shall I call an ambulance for you now?”

Su Xue’s face turned pale. She clenched her fists tightly, so angry that she could not speak.

Qiao Shan looked at Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou with hatred written all over his face. Anger and disappointment surged in his heart, and he began coughing so hard that his face turned bright red. After a bout of coughing, he spat out a mouthful of blood. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Dad!” Qiao Xin cried out in alarm.

Qiao Xin ran over to support Qiao Shan, gently patting his back. Tears welled up in her eyes. “Dad, are you feeling unwell? Why don’t we send you to the hospital now?”

Qiao Shan’s face was flushed red from coughing. He felt so uncomfortable that he couldn’t even speak.

Qiao Xin’s tears began to fall. She glared at Qiao Nian angrily and questioned, “Qiao Nian, did you try to anger Dad on purpose? How can you go so far?!”

When Qiao Nian heard Qiao Xin’s words, she cut her off innocently. “I didn’t do anything.”

“It’s clearly you who’s in the wrong. You deliberately angered Dad. You knew everything from the start…” Qiao Xin said accusingly, looking extremely unhappy with Qiao Nian.

“What do you mean by that? Why don’t I understand? What do I know?” Qiao Nian looked at Qiao Xin innocently.

Qiao Xin’s face turned red with anger. Qiao Nian clearly knew that her mother was having an affair, but she still invited her father over on purpose. If Dad hadn’t caught Mom having an affair, why would he have hit her?

However, Qiao Xin couldn’t say any of this out loud. She fumed in silence, her tears falling one by one.

Qiao Nian looked even more innocent. Her gaze fell on Qiu Nan, who was not far away, and she said meaningfully, “Gu Zhou has simply made a report in your stead. You’ll have to explain the details to the police yourself. The Qiao family will definitely compensate you for your losses!”

A trace of surprise flashed in Qiu Nan’s eyes, and his lips immediately curved up. He was so happy that he no longer felt any pain. He hurriedly nodded and said, “Okay, okay. I’ll definitely tell the police everything about Qiao Shan’s violence against me. I won’t miss a single detail.”

Su Xue was so anxious that tears began to stream down her face. She had never expected that the person she had been having an affair with was a bastard.

Su Xue glared daggers at Qiu Nan.

Meeting Su Xue’s resentful gaze, Qiu Nan rolled his eyes. He said shamelessly, “I don’t have any sadomasochist fetishes. Just because he’s wealthy and powerful, Qiao Shan thinks he has the right to beat me up. Although I’m just an ordinary citizen, no man is above the law. Since he assaulted me, he should go to jail! Oh dear, my wrist really hurts. Officer, sir, can you send me to the hospital now? I can’t take the pain anymore!”

Looking at Qiu Nan’s helpless expression, Su Xue felt a wave of disgust so strong that she wanted to throw up.

Qiao Nian was very satisfied with Qiu Nan’s performance. Her red lips curved up slightly.

Indeed, the wicked would be punished by their own ilk.

This was simply too exciting.

Qiao Shan and Su Xue would soon experience the same suffering she had gone through back then. They would know from experience how she had felt.

Although the events that had unfolded were a little different from what she had expected, Qiao Shan and Su Xue’s relationship had been completely ruined. Her goal had been achieved. The rest was up to them to fight among themselves!

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian walked out of the room.

Gu Zhou walked out as well. When he passed by Qiao Yu, he paused for a moment and looked at him coldly. His voice was low and hoarse, with a hint of ice. “When you look at my wife, control your gaze!”

Qiao Yu clenched his fists involuntarily, but his expression remained impassive. He turned to look at Gu Zhou and asked calmly, “Even if you’re married, you can still get a divorce, right?”

Gu Zhou looked meaningfully at Qiao Yu and walked out with an indifferent expression.

Qiao Xin didn’t know what Qiao Yu had said to Gu Zhou. She stepped over to Qiao Yu and asked anxiously, “What should we do now? Dad’s going to jail!”
