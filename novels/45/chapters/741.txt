742 Lying

Once the seed of doubt was planted, that seed would instantly sprout and grow!

The more she thought about it, the more she felt that Gu Zhou and Gu Qi were very likely father and son.

She didn’t know how Jiang Yue found out about this.

Qiao Nian couldn’t believe that Gu Zhou had lied to her.

Gu Zhou sensed that something was wrong with Qiao Nian’s expression. He looked at her in confusion and asked, “Are you feeling unwell? Do you want me to get the family doctor to come over?”

“I’m fine. I’m just a little tired!” Qiao Nian said casually. She swallowed nervously and looked away. “I’ll go to the pharmacy first. I just remembered a medicine that can treat your insomnia. I’ll try it!”

As Qiao Nian spoke, she walked towards the bedroom door.

Gu Zhou watched as Qiao Nian left. He stood up and quickly walked over to her, grabbing her arm. “Are you really fine? If you’re not feeling well, just say so.”

Smiling, Qiao Nian pushed Gu Zhou’s hand away from her arm. A trace of loneliness flashed in her eyes as she said, “I’m really fine!”

Qiao Nian pushed Gu Zhou’s hand away and walked out without hesitation.

Her heart was in a mess. She didn’t know how to face Gu Zhou. She quickly walked downstairs.

She and Gu Zhou had driven back. She walked to the cabinet by the door and took the car keys they had placed there when they first got home.

When they went to the Lu family home, she and Gu Zhou sat in the back seat of the car.

Her hair was a little yellow, but Gu Zhou’s hair was completely black.

Qiao Nian quickly walked to the car, opened the door to the back seat, and got in. She carefully searched the back seat and finally found Gu Zhou’s hair.

Qiao Nian hurriedly wrapped Gu Zhou’s hair in tissue paper and stuffed it into her bag.

When Qiao Nian got out of the car, she realized that Gu Zhou was standing ten meters away from her.

Qiao Nian’s heart was in her throat. Had Gu Zhou seen everything she had just done?

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian felt uneasy.

“Why did you come down?” Qiao Nian pretended to be relaxed and happy. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he walked calmly to the driver’s seat, opened the door, and said, “I left my phone in the car. I’m here to get my phone. Were you looking for something just now?”

Qiao Nian placed her hands behind her back and tugged at the buttons of her jacket. Smiling, she said, “I just realized that the buttons on my jacket had fallen off, so I came over to look for them. I didn’t expect to really find them.”

As Qiao Nian spoke, she walked towards her car.

Seeing that Qiao Nian was about to leave, a trace of worry flashed in Gu Zhou’s eyes. He asked, “Where are you going?”

Could it be that Qiao Nian was planning to meet Jiang Yue?

Otherwise, why would Qiao Nian choose to go out at this time?

Qiao Nian tried her best to act normal. “A friend called and asked me out for afternoon tea.”

Gu Zhou nodded and couldn’t help but ask, “Have you read the documents Jiang Yue gave you?”

He felt that something was wrong with Qiao Nian, so he followed her down.

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, her expression froze. She gripped her bag nervously and said, “She just wanted to tell me that you’ve hidden some things from me in the past.”

Gu Zhou walked towards Qiao Nian step by step, staring unblinkingly at her. He asked seriously, “Then do you believe her?”

Qiao Nian hesitated for a moment before shaking her head.

It wasn’t that she didn’t want to believe it, but she couldn’t.

Gu Zhou reached out and took Qiao Nian’s hand. His eyes were deep, and his voice was a little low. “Don’t trust others easily.”

Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat. She lowered her gaze, not wanting Gu Zhou to see the expression in her eyes.

Don’t trust others so easily.

Gu Zhou was right.

Even if Gu Qi was Gu Zhou’s child, this didn’t mean anything.

She herself had many secrets.

Just like how she had no intention of telling Gu Zhou that she was the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

Moreover, that night five years ago, she accidentally lost her virginity.

This matter might not be a big deal in today’s society.

Later on, she gave birth to two children, but neither of them survived.
