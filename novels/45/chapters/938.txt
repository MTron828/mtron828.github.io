939 Did I Humiliate You?

Qiao Xin’s face was pale as she looked at Qiao Yu in disappointment. Tears streamed down her face as she questioned tearfully, “Brother, I’m your biological sister. How can you humiliate me?”

“I’m humiliating you? If anyone else finds out about this, no one will say that you’re outstanding. They’ll think that you’re jealous of Qiao Nian, which is why you keep trying to ruin her. The first time, you succeeded. You won’t even think about whether your actions back then violated the law. This time, you failed. You almost died!” Qiao Yu’s face was red with anger as he said firmly.

Su Xue finally understood. She frowned at Qiao Xin. “Did she really…”

“She found a few men to ruin Qiao Nian!”

When Su Xue heard Qiao Yu’s words, she sighed and continued, “Your sister is still young. She just came back from the gates of hell. You shouldn’t have attacked her!”

“She’s still young?” Qiao Yu raised his eyebrows slightly and said coldly, “At her age, I’ve already lived overseas alone for a few years. Do you think it’s a small matter for her to deal with Qiao Nian?” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Su Xue pursed her lips and continued, “But this didn’t happen!”

“It’s precisely because you and Father have been indulging Qiao Xin that Qiao Xin could even do outrageous thing. She’s only in her twenties. Logically speaking, she should be an innocent young lady. Right now, her bones are filled with black water and she’s extremely dirty. If Qiao Xin succeeds, do you think the Qiao family will still be able to have a foothold in An City?” Qiao Yu panted heavily, his brow furrowed. “You really have a biased opinion!”

When Qiao Shan heard Qiao Yu’s words, he came back to his senses and said, “You said that she’s now the director of Nanshan Corporation. If Qiao Nian bears a grudge against Qiao Xin, then Nanshan Corporation will never be able to work with us for the rest of our lives! Not only that, the Qiao family might be suppressed by Nanshan Corporation!”

“Dad, you’ve forgotten something. Qiao Nian has already married Gu Zhou. She’s now the only Young Madam of the Gu family, the largest family in An City. Gu Zhou has taken over all the assets of the Gu family. If Qiao Nian’s reputation as Mrs. Gu was damaged, regardless of whether Gu Zhou likes Qiao Nian or not, Gu Zhou will definitely not sit back and do nothing. For the sake of the Gu family’s reputation, he will definitely attack the Qiao family.”

Qiao Yu glanced at his family sternly and continued, “Last time, Gu Zhou hated our Qiao family and suppressed us. However, at that time, he didn’t think of chasing us out of An City. He just wanted to make things difficult for us. It took me half a year to turn the situation around. If Qiao Xin succeeds this time, the Qiao family will no longer exist!”

Hearing Qiao Yu’s words, Su Xue broke out in a cold sweat. She pressed her palms together and prayed softly before saying, “Fortunately, your sister didn’t succeed. Qiao Xin, can you discuss with Mom before you do anything?”

When Qiao Xin heard Qiao Yu’s words, she broke out in a cold sweat.

At that time, she was certain that Song Man was the eldest daughter of the Lu family. With Song Man around, she was not worried that Qiao Nian would take revenge on her at all.

But who would have thought that Song Man was dead…

She did not expect to be deceived by Song Man. Song Man was not the eldest daughter of the Lu family at all. She was just an imposter!

Cold sweat broke out on Qiao Xin’s face. She gripped the bed sheets tightly with both hands and looked at Qiao Yu timidly, saying carefully, “I… I…”

“What else did you do?” Qiao Yu didn’t have a good impression of Qiao Xin.

Qiao Xin hurriedly shook her head. At this moment, she had already forgotten the pain in her leg. She said shakily, “I’ve caused trouble!”

As soon as Qiao Xin finished speaking, Qiao Shan and Su Xue turned pale, cold sweat breaking out on their foreheads.

Qiao Yu narrowed his eyes slightly and suppressed his anger, exuding a cold aura.

Qiao Shan swallowed nervously and asked, “What exactly is going on?”

Qiao Xin’s eyes darted around. She pursed her lips and remained silent.

“Tell me!” Su Xue grabbed Qiao Xin’s hand. She was so anxious that she was about to cry. If the Qiao family was gone, their entire family would be gone!

“I-I think I’ve angered the Lu family,” Qiao Xin said timidly, looking frightened.
