Chapter 1797 - 1797 The Truth

Cui Qi noticed Cui Si’s small actions. His eyes were red and he tilted his head slightly. He obediently let Cui Si examine his face and hurriedly explained, “Dad, in court, Annie was worried that I would betray Mark and shot me. At that time, I was indeed about to die. Fortunately, Miss Gu gave me a life-saving pill. That pill kept me alive. Later, Dr. Ollie saved me.”

Cui Si was completely sure that there was no mask on Cui Qi’s face, nor were there any signs of plastic surgery. It was indeed his Qi’er.

Coming to terms that the person in front of him was his son, Cui Si hugged him and choked. “Good, good, this is great. Fortunately, you’re still alive.”

Although Cui Qi did not know what was going on, he did not want Mark, the villain, to go unpunished. He reached out and pushed Cui Si away. “Dad, now is not the time to catch up. I was deceived by Mark in the past. I always thought that the president wanted to kill our Cui family. After an investigation, I realized that it was all Mark’s scheme.”

“The president didn’t kill us before. It was Mark who took the initiative to kill us. Dad, don’t be deceived by Mark!” Cui Qi said earnestly.

Cui Si was still overwhelmed after he found his son. When he heard Cui Qi’s words, his expression instantly darkened.

Sha He had already moved to Cui Si’s side and asked in a low voice, “Boss, are we still going to kill the president?”

Cui Si wiped his tears. His gaze landed on the president’s face, then moved to Mark’s.

For so many years, he lived because of his hatred for the president.

If someone else said that Mark was the mastermind behind the Cui family’s death, he would not believe it. However, the person who was telling him this was his son.

He knew that Cui Qi was raised by Mark. He also knew that Cui Qi used to listen to Mark very much.

If Cui Qi betrayed Mark now, it meant that Mark was really the murderer who persecuted the Cui family.

Cui Si’s eyes narrowed dangerously. He pursed his lips tightly. He believed Cui Qi.

However, Cui Si was a cautious person. He looked at Cui Qi beside him and asked again, “Do you have evidence?”

“Yes.” Cui Qi nodded seriously and said with a serious expression, “There are both witnesses and evidence!”

Cui Si was so angry that his face turned red. He bit his lip and snatched the gun from Sha He’s hand. He quickly walked towards Mark, who could only open his mouth and not speak.

Gu Zhou roughly understood what Cui Si wanted to do. He frowned slightly, not agreeing with Cui Si’s actions.

The president also understood what Cui Si was going to do and quickly said, “Cui Si, Mark can’t die yet!”

Gu Zhou and the President were about to walk towards Mark when Chen Sheng stood in front of them, blocking their way.

“It’s fine.” Chen Sheng’s voice was cold and his tone was firm.

When Gu Zhou heard Chen Sheng’s words, he heaved a sigh of relief.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Big Brother followed Cui Si and should know him very well.

Since his brother was not worried that Cui Si would take the initiative to kill Mark, it meant that Cui Si probably would not do that. Therefore, he watched the show in peace.

The President turned to look at Gu Zhou and saw him nod at him.

Cui Si held the gun in his hand and walked step by step to Mark.

All these years, he had lived in a foreign country so that he could wash away the Cui family’s injustice one day and return to Europe openly.

However, he had never expected that the disaster that the Cui family had experienced and his suffering from homesickness in a foreign country were all because Mark wanted to recruit him.

Cui Si pursed his lips. Mark first pretended to be his benefactor, making him believe Mark’s words without a doubt.

Over the years, he had done many dirty things for Mark. He really gave his blood, sweat and tears for Mark.

But what about Mark?

Didn’t Mark feel guilty about the way he treated him at all after so many years?

Cui Si pulled the safety catch and aimed the gun at Mark.

He couldn’t take his eyes off Mark. Although Mark could no longer speak, he could see deep fear in Mark’s eyes.
