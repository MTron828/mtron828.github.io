Chapter 93: Safflower?

Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

This time, Qiao Nian didn’t doubt Doctor Su’s words. She believed that his medical skills were definitely solid. Only then could he have become Grandma’s attending physician.

However, this time, Grandma’s pulse did indicate that she had been poisoned.

This time, she was not entirely confident that she could save Grandma.

But now, if she could find out the cause of Grandma’s poisoning, she could save her.

Qiao Nian’s heart was beating wildly, but her expression remained calm. Her gaze fell on a table not far away.

‘There was a blue and white porcelain teacup on the table. Jiang Yue had handed this cup to Matriarch Gu just now, and Matriarch Gu had finished all the tea in it.

A servant handed Matriarch Gu’s medical records to Qiao Nian. Qiao Nian took the documents from him and looked up at the butler. “Butler, go and get the dregs of the medicine I’ve brewed, as well as the dregs of the cold medicine from just now.”

“Yes, ma‘am,.” the butler answered and quickly walked out.

Jiang Yue turned pale. She tugged at her sleeves uneasily.

Qiao Nian wasn’t idle either. She took a brief look at her grandmother’s medical records over the past two months. Her grandmother had been in good health lately, and it had been a long time since her last asthma attack.

Qiao Nian took out the silver needles she always carried with her. After disinfecting them, she helped Matriarch Gu up.

Seeing Qiao Nian’s actions, Doctor Su thought that Qiao Nian was trying to seal Matriarch Gu’s pain acupoints to give her relief from the pain. He rolled his eyes silently.

He had been looking forward to seeing Qiao Nian perform something amazing, but it tuned out that she was just putting on a show!

Just as Doctor Su was looking at Qiao Nian with scorn and disdain, he saw Qiao Nian picking up a silver needle and inserting it into Matriarch Gu’s larynx.

After that, Qiao Nian pressed down on Matriarch Gu’s stomach, her movements sharp and professional.

Doctor Su frowned deeply. He didn’t understand what Qiao Nian was doing.

Qiao Nian then clapped Matriarch Gu hard on the back. Matriarch Gu, who was still unconscious, immediately reacted. She threw up everything she had just eaten.

Doctor Su was stunned. This was the first time he had seen someone use acupuncture to induce vomiting.

Doctor Su straightened his back and took a step towards Matriarch Gu’s bed, wanting to see what Qiao Nian was going to do next.

However, the servants were crowding the area. Doctor Su simply couldn’t approach the bed any further.

Because everyone was busy cleaning up the mess made by Matriarch Gu’s vomit.

Doctor Su began to observe Qiao Nian’s techniques. For some reason, he suddenly recalled a few years ago, he had once read in an acupuncture book that acupuncture could be used to induce vomiting.

However, ordinary doctors would not dare to use this method. This method would put the acupuncture skills of a doctor to the test.

If the technique was used incorrectly, the patient might suffocate and die.

Doctor Su no longer dared to underestimate Qiao Nian. He was very curious now if Qiao Nian could save Matriarch Gu.

Matriarch Gu was already halfway to death’s door.

After vomiting, Matriarch Gu was placed back onto the bed by Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian glanced at the clock and inserted a few more needles into Matriarch Gu’s body. Only then did she heave a sigh of relief. At long last, Matriarch Gu was safe.

At this moment, the butler had already brought over the medicinal dregs.

Qiao Nian first inspected her medicinal dregs. Be it the ingredients or the proportions used, there was no problem she could see.

After that, she examined the medicinal dregs used to treat Grandma’s cold, and her expression gradually turned serious. When she saw the safflower in the black medicinal dregs, her eyes widened and her breathing quickened.

How could this be?

Previously, when she was preparing her medicine, she had added only a little safflower.

But there was no safflower in Doctor Su’s prescription. Why was there safflower in the dregs? Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

There was a great quantity of safflower. It would be dangerous for ordinary people to consume this amount, let alone Grandma, who was physically weak and who suffered from heart disease.

Safflower was effective in promoting blood circulation, and was helpful in treating heart disease to a certain degree.

If a lot of safflower was consumed, patients with heart disease would likely suffer severe side effects..
