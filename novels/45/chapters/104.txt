“Lspent so much effort cultivating the Suranne Grass myself. How has it suddenly become the property of the Qiao family?” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Su Xue knew very well that Qiao Nian was displeased with the Qiao family. Putting on a polite demeanor, she said, “Qiao Nian, what happened back then was our fault, but at that time, your father and I were both busy with the company. The reason we didn’t visit you was to cover up the fact that you were

once pregnant and had a child. Everything was for your marriage. If others knew that you were pregnant and even gave birth to a child, they might look at you differently.”

Seeing that Qiao Nian was silent, Su Xue thought that Qiao Nian had been swayed by her words. She continued, “Back then, if news of what happened to you got out, you wouldn’t be able to marry anyone for the rest of your life. Qiao Nian, we’re family, after all. Your father also has you in his heart. He

dotes on you a lot. Often, because of you, he secretly wipes his tears at night.”

Qiao Nian stood there expressionlessly. She looked toward Su Xue and asked curiously, “Then, can I take everything the Qiao family owns, and chase you out of the family home? Didn’t you say that we’re family? What’s yours is mine.”

“You…” Su Xue’s face turned red with anger.

“Were you lying to me just now?” Qiao Nian looked at Su Xue. She wanted to see what other preposterous lies this woman could make up.

“How… How is that the same? We are your elders!” Su Xue stammered.

“Elders? For my sake, you sent me to a mental hospital?” Qiao Nian’s expression was cold, her voice even colder. “If the same thing happened to any other child of a rich family, the parents would just send their child overseas to study. But why was I sent to a mental hospital? When I was alone in the

mental hospital with no one to rely on, what were you doing? Why didn’t you say that you were my elders back then?”

Qiao Xin immediately said gently, “Sister, it’s a blessing in disguise. If Mom and Dad didn’t send you to the mental hospital, how could you have settled down to cultivate Suranne Grass?”

Qiao Nian smiled. There was anger in her eyes. “Why don’t I send you to a mental hospital for five years? Will that do?”

Qiao Xin turned pale in fright. She lowered her head, not daring to say another word.

Su Xue’s eyes darted to the side and she hurriedly said, “Qiao Nian, your sister is right. You don’t have to thank us for sending you to the mental hospital, though that was why you were able to cultivate Suranne Grass. How about this? As long as you bring back all the remaining Suranne Grass, that will do.

Write down the method to cultivate Suranne Grass, and we won’t make a fuss about it with you!”

Qiao Nian glared at Su Xue coldly. Su Xue was clearly asking for too much. She gritted her teeth and spat out three words. “In your dreams!”

“What do you mean?” Su Xue looked at Qiao Nian in confusion. She felt that what she said made sense. She already had Qiao Nian’s interests in mind. “As long as you hand over the Suranne Grass and write down the method to cultivate it, you will be the greatest contributor to our family. Your father and I

will prepare a richer dowry for you!”

Qiao Nian couldn’t be bothered to reason with these idiots. She enunciated each word clearly as she spoke. “I spent many years of effort nurturing the Suranne Grass. This belongs only to me. It has nothing to do with your Qiao family!

“If you know what’s good for you, hand over the Suranne Grass immediately. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being impolite!” Qiao Nian continued, forcibly suppressing her anger.

Qiao Xin looked at Suranne Grass reluctantly. It was such a valuable item. Of course she couldn’t bear to return it.

Previously, after Qiao Nian had made a name for herself in An University, Brother Su Yan was longer paying Qiao Xin any attention. If she gave the Suranne Grass to Su Yan, he would definitely think highly of her and reconcile with her.

Qiao Xin looked imploringly at Su Xue, signaling for her to keep the Suranne Grass.

Su Xue instantly understood what Qiao Xin meant. She looked at Qiao Nian and said helplessly, “Qiao Nian, you’re the elder sister. How can you fight with your younger sister over a pot of Suranne Grass? Can’t you give in to her a little?”

Qiao Nian hated it when Su Xue played the family card.

The Qiao family might not be good at anything else, but they were good at moral abduction.

Qiao Nian said impatiently, “Enough nonsense. Are you returning it or not?”

“Not!” Su Xue said, her expression dark.

Qiao Nian had never spoken to her in such a tone before she went to the mental hospital.

Qiao Nian’s eyes turned cold. “Is that so?”

Qiao Shan also felt that Qiao Nian had gone too far. Haughtily, he said, “Hurry up and bring back all the Suranne Grass that you’ve taken to the Gu residence. Then, I won’t pursue the fact that you talked back to your elders today!”

Qiao Nian clenched her fists tightly..
