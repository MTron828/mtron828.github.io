834 Worried

Could it be that Gu Zhou already knew about Song Man and Xiao Shi?

Qiao Nian’s heart began to race, and the uneasiness in her heart gradually grew.

Her mind went blank. She quickly reacted and quickly walked out.

She could not let Gu Zhou go to the Dongjiang villa.

Even if Gu Zhou wanted to go to the Dongjiang villa, he had to hear her out first.

She was really worried that Gu Zhou would be deceived by Song Man.

If Song Man was a good mother, she would not think much of it. However, Song Man was clearly not a good mother.

As Qiao Nian walked out, she called Gu Zhou frantically.

However, the cold voice of the automated recording came through the phone, indicating that Gu Zhou’s phone had been turned off.

Gu Zhou’s phone must have run out of battery.

She wanted to see Gu Zhou before he arrived at the Dongjiang villa!

Just now, the servant had said that Gu Zhou had only been gone for five minutes. If she drove faster, she would probably be able to reach the Dongjiang villa early.

Qiao Nian quickly walked downstairs. She couldn’t contact Gu Zhou now, so she could only call Chen Qing, but his phone was also switched off.

Qiao Nian could only call Xiao Shi, hoping that she could make preparations in advance.

At this moment, Xiao Shi had just woken up. She placed her phone on the bed and went to the bathroom to wash up. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Song Man had just put on her clothes when she heard Xiao Shi’s phone ring. She walked towards the bed.

When she saw that the caller ID was Qiao Nian, her eyes instantly darkened. She only hoped that Qiao Nian would draw a line between her and Xiao Shi. She didn’t want Qiao Nian to disturb Xiao Shi at all.

With this thought in mind, Song Man hung up on Qiao Nian and deleted the call history. She had wanted to add Qiao Nian to the blacklist, but in the next moment, she hesitated.

Although Xiao Shi was young, she was not like other children who were extremely stupid. Xiao Shi had her own thoughts. If she forcefully deleted Qiao Nian’s phone number, it would only lead to Xiao Shi’s dissatisfaction. When that happened, she might push Xiao Shi to Qiao Nian.

With this thought in mind, Song Man placed her phone on the bed and walked to the side.

It was only past six o’clock, but Qiao Nian had already called. This meant that Qiao Nian had something very important to tell Xiao Shi. However, she was very curious about what Qiao Nian wanted to say to Xiao Shi.

She hoped that if Qiao Nian called again, she could pick up the phone and hear what she had to say.

At this moment, Xiao Shi finished washing up and walked out of the bathroom with a basin of water.

“Mommy, let me help you wash your face!”

A gentle smile appeared on Song Man’s face. She nodded and agreed. “Okay!”

Xiao Shi wiped Song Man’s face with a towel, then brought the water back to the bathroom to pour it out.

Song Man didn’t want to receive another call from Qiao Nian. When she saw Xiao Shi come out, she immediately pretended to be weak and uncomfortable. “Xiao Shi, I don’t know what’s going on either. I feel a tightness in my chest!”

When she heard Song Man’s words, she immediately became nervous. She ran to Song Man with her short legs and asked anxiously, “Mommy, are you feeling unwell? Why don’t we go to the hospital now?”

Song Man forced a smile and shook her head gently. “It should be an old illness. I’m fine. Come down with me!”

Xiao Shi did not think too much about it. She helped Song Man downstairs, her eyes filled with concern for her.

…

Seeing that Xiao Shi didn’t pick up, Qiao Nian thought that she wasn’t awake yet, so she called Gu Zhou again.

However, Gu Zhou’s phone was still switched off.

…

Gu Zhou realized that his phone had been turned off. He looked at Chen Qing and said, “Give me your phone!”

Without another word, Chen Qing handed his phone to Gu Zhou and said, “Second Young Master, my phone password is your birthday!”

Holding Chen Qing’s phone, Gu Zhou frowned slightly and said indifferently, “Change the password in the future.”

“Huh?”

Gu Zhou was about to unlock his phone when he realized that Chen Qing’s phone was also dead. “Did you bring a phone charger?”

Chen Qing nodded and hurriedly handed the charging cord to Gu Zhou. “Here!”
