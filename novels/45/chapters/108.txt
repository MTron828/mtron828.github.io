In truth, Wang Miao had not gone far. Her sobs could be heard from within the study.

Gu Zhou’s expression turned ugly. He frowned in displeasure, a wave of irritation washing over him.

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on the snake and he said impatiently, “Well, hurry up! Aren’t you going to lock it up in the punishment room?”

Hearing this, the butler picked up the cage and prepared to leave the room.

“Wait a minute.” Qiao Nian stepped closer to the cage and looked at the snake, which was curled up in an aggrieved ball. “Actually, it didn’t do anything wrong. It was just guarding your study.”

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian with a complicated expression. His gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s injured arm and he said very seriously, “But it bit you.”

The man’s voice was as deep as ever. There was no emotion in his voice.

Qiao Nian glanced at the bite mark on her arm and said, “The wound on my arm isn’t too bad. Once the bleeding has stopped, I’ll apply some medicine, then I’ll be perfectly fine. We can’t punish it just because of an outsider’s mistake!”

Gu Zhou gazed intently at Qiao Nian, his eyebrow slightly raised. “So Mrs. Gu thinks that I’m not an outsider? Am I a part of the family?”

Qiao Nian was speechless.

Qiao Nian had not expected Gu Zhou to joke around with her. However, hearing Gu Zhou call her Mrs. Gu caught her off guard, and she was momentarily flustered.

The butler, who was standing at the side, had never expected such flirtatious words to fall from Gu Zhou’s lips.

At this moment, the butler felt like the biggest third wheel in existence. It was no longer suitable for him to remain, so he quietly left the room.

Qiao Nian gazed unblinkingly at Gu Zhou. She met his dark, glittering eyes and pursed her lips, her throat working slightly. “I’m talking about the snake and Wang Miao. This snake is closest to you.”

Gu Zhou stared unblinkingly back at Qiao Nian. His gaze fell on her fair and slender neck, and he noticed the movement of her throat. Her cheeks were just a little flushed, and the tips of her ears were also tinted red. For some reason, she gave off an air of delicacy.

Gu Zhou’s mouth was a little dry, but he quickly recovered his usual impassiveness. His thin lips parted slightly. “As long as it doesn’t hurt you anymore, I’ll let it off the hook.”

Qiao Nian smiled and looked down at the snake in the cage. The snake was looking at her too.

Although the snake had bitten her, she felt that it was the victim this time round.

If the snake had bitten her like it did the last time, she would have boiled the snake alive for its medicinal properties. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Most importantly, Qiao Nian could tell that Gu Zhou cared about the snake a lot.

At the thought, Qiao Nian opened the cage and reached in.

Gu Zhou’s usually serene eyes instantly narrowed. He looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief, his heart involuntarily rising to his throat. “Qiao Nian, what are you doing?”

The snake kept flicking out its tongue, staring unblinkingly at Qiao Nian’s arm.

In truth, Qiao Nian was also very nervous. Her gaze fell on the snake’s teeth, which were exposed from time to time. With extreme effort, she put on a calm facade.

‘The temperature in the room dropped.

Qiao Nian placed her hand carefully on the snake’s head, caressing it over and over again, as if she were soothing its injured feelings.

Perhaps it was because Qiao Nian’s touch was very gentle. The snake didn’t seem to sense any aggression. Instead, it lay obediently on the bottom of the cage, letting Qiao Nian stroke it.

Gu Zhou looked at this scene in disbelief. He didn’t expect this snake to turn into an obedient and cute kitten under Qiao Nian’s touch.

‘When Qiao Nian retracted her hand, the snake wound itself around her wrist happily.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but smile. She looked up at Gu Zhou and said proudly, “Look, it won’t hurt me anymore, so you don’t have to lock it up anymore.”

Seeing Qiao Nian’s proud expression, the ice in Gu Zhou’s heart seemed to melt.

Qiao Nian’s smile now was probably the most natural smile she had worn since she arrived at the Gu residence. She looked like an innocent child.

“From now on, it’s yours.”

“Really?” Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She looked at Gu Zhou in confusion.

Gu Zhou found himself speechless.

‘What was he saying?

‘Was there something wrong with his brain?

Other than his grandmother, this snake was the only female who was close to him..
