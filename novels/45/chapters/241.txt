Chapter 242: Quitting School!

Ye Ran looked at Wang Xuan in disdain and muttered, “I won’t do such a tasteless thing.”

Seeing that Ye Ran had no objections, Professor Zhang said, “Okay!”

When Ye Ran heard Professor Zhang’s words, her body trembled imperceptibly. For some reason, she felt a little flustered.

She suddenly had a bad feeling.

Could it be that Qiao Nian really didn’t steal that ticket?

How was this possible?

She had already investigated Qiao Nian’s background in detail. Qiao Nian was not well-liked in the Qiao family and had been thrown into the countryside to grow up. Moreover, the Qiao family was not a musical family.

At the thought of this, Ye Ran felt much less uneasy. It was impossible for Qiao Nian to get a ticket to Mr. Dong Hua’s concert.

Ye Ran looked at Qiao Nian provocatively and said sternly, “Qiao Nian, don’t kneel down and beg for mercy!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Qiao Nian gave a faint smile.

For the sake of fairness, Professor Zhang first looked at the phone photos of the three students. He saw the number on Ye Ran’s ticket. Then, he picked up the ticket Qiao Nian had placed on the table.

At this moment, everyone held their breaths and stared unblinkingly at Professor Zhang, waiting for the results.

After Professor Zhang returned the tickets to Qiao Nian, his gaze fell on Ye Ran’s face. A trace of anger flashed in his eyes as he said, “Pack your things and withdraw from school!”

Oh my god!

She was really going to quit school!

Everyone turned pale in fear. They had thought that Qiao Nian was just joking, and that Professor Zhang was just going along with her words.

Ye Ran was so frightened that she felt a chill run down her spine. Her body couldn’t help but tremble, and the handprint on her face became even more obvious. Her hair fell messily on her shoulders, making her look extremely disheveled.

Ye Ran shook her head in disbelief, her beautiful eyes misty. She murmured, “Impossible, this is absolutely impossible. How is this possible? Professor Zhang, you must be wrong. She must have stolen my tickets…”

Before anyone could react, Ye Ran threw herself into Qiao Nian’s hands and snatched the tickets away. She compared the tickets to the photos on Gao Lin’s phone.

Ye Ran’s eyes widened, afraid that she would miss the details. The ticket numbers were the same at the start. When she saw the last three numbers, Ye Ran frowned.

The last three numbers for Qiao Nian’s ticket were for 520 yuan.

The last three places on her ticket were 138.

How could this be?

How could a country bumpkin like Qiao Nian have such a ticket?

The other students also leaned over curiously to compare them.

Indeed, the last three places were different.

This meant that Qiao Nian didn’t steal Ye Ran’s ticket. This ticket belonged to Qiao Nian herself.

Ye Ran was on the verge of breaking down. She looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief and questioned tearfully, “Qiao Nian, did you steal this ticket from someone else?”

Seeing that Ye Ran was about to break down, Qiao Nian found Ye Ran very funny. She said coldly, “Your thoughts are dirty. Do you think everyone’s thoughts are dirty?”

When Ye Ran heard Qiao Nian’s words, she swayed on the spot.

If her parents knew that she had dropped out of school, they would definitely be very disappointed in her.

No, she couldn’t quit school.

She had only misunderstood Qiao Nian. Why should she drop out of school over such a small matter?

Qiao Nian must have taken out a fake ticket just to get her to quit school.

Yes, yes!

There was no doubt about it. Yesterday, Qiao Nian was jealous that she had a ticket to Mr. Dong Hua’s concert, so she stole her ticket that night and took the opportunity to make a fake ticket.

That’s right. That had to be it.

If she was chased out of the school by Qiao Nian, no one would discover that Qiao Nian had stolen her tickets.

Ye Ran glared fiercely at Qiao Nian and said viciously, “Qiao Nian, you must have stolen my tickets last night, then made a fake ticket. Today, you brought it here to frame me. You deliberately made me think that you stole my tickets, then forced me to drop out of school! This way, no one will know that you stole my tickets!”
