738 How Obedient

Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou and inadvertently met his bright eyes. Her lips curved up slightly, and she placed her hand on Gu Zhou’s.

The two of them walked into the Gu family villa hand in hand.

When the servants in the garden saw Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou’s actions, they were all stunned. Then, they couldn’t help but smile.

Now, it seemed that Second Young Master and Second Young Madam’s relationship was getting better and better. Soon, the Gu family would have another child.

Matriarch Gu, who had been sitting on the second floor, smiled brightly when she saw Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian holding hands.

Originally, these two children had only held hands secretly at night. Now, they couldn’t wait to hold hands during the day. This meant that their relationship was better than before.

Matriarch Gu thought that it wouldn’t be long before Qiao Nian became pregnant.

At the thought that another child would be born, Matriarch Gu inadvertently thought of Gu Qi.

When Matriarch Gu thought of what had happened previously, she couldn’t help but sigh.

She had never expected Gu Zhou to have been schemed against and even left behind a child.

If Qiao Nian knew that Gu Qi was the child of Gu Zhou and another woman, she might even leave Gu Zhou.

Matriarch Gu’s frown deepened. She didn’t know what to do with Gu Qi either.

Just as Matriarch Gu was feeling a headache, there was a knock on the door.

Matriarch Gu thought that a servant had arrived. She said, “Come in.”

When the door opened, Matriarch Gu did not see anyone. Her gaze gradually moved down and she noticed that it was Gu Qi who had entered her room.

Matriarch Gu smiled and waved at Gu Qi. “Xiao Qi, come here. Come to Great-Grandma!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Great-Grandma,” Gu Qi greeted, then walked to Matriarch Gu’s side.

Matriarch Gu reached out and held Gu Qi’s small hand. With a serious expression, she said, “Has Xiao Qi been happy in kindergarten recently?”

“Yes!”

Gu Qi replied casually. He looked around, as if he was looking for something.

Seeing this, Matriarch Gu smiled at Gu Qi and said, “Xiao Qi, what are you looking for?”

Gu Qi looked around and said, “Bamboo dragonflies.”

Matriarch Gu was about to get up and help Gu Qi find something when she saw Gu Qi let go of her hand and walk towards the windowsill. Then, he picked up the bamboo dragonfly from the ground.

At this moment, Matriarch Gu instantly understood that Gu Qi must have accidentally gotten the dragonfly into her room while playing downstairs.

Matriarch Gu looked at Gu Qi with heartache. When she was taking care of Gu Qi, he spoke more. However, later on, because she wasn’t in good health, she couldn’t take care of Gu Qi personally. Later on, he met a black-hearted nanny, which was why he became so autistic.

Matriarch Gu sighed heavily. Seeing that Gu Qi’s attention was all on the bamboo dragonfly, she smiled and said, “Do you want Great-Grandma to play with the bamboo dragonfly with you?”

“Great-Grandma, rest. I’ll play by myself,” Gu Qi said calmly.

With that, Gu Qi bowed to Matriarch Gu and turned to leave. He couldn’t help but be blinded by a light.

He turned his head and saw that the light was reflected from the bed.

Gu Qi frowned. He walked towards the bed. When he reached the bed, he noticed a needle by the pillow.

Gu Qi picked up the needle and handed it to Matriarch Gu. “Great-Grandma, this is for you!”

When Matriarch Gu saw Gu Qi pick up the needle from the pillow on the bed, she was stunned.

Previously, when she was embroidering, she had accidentally dropped a needle. She had never found it, nor did she care.

She had wanted to rest for a while in the afternoon. If Gu Qi hadn’t come, she might have died.

“Thank you. Gu Qi is really a good child. What a good child!” Matriarch Gu stroked Gu Qi’s head, feeling extremely emotional.

If only Gu Qi had come out of Qiao Nian’s stomach. That way, she wouldn’t have to worry about anything.

Matriarch Gu hoped that Qiao Nian would accept Gu Qi, but Gu Zhou had never said anything about this, so she couldn’t say it directly.

Gu Qi walked out with the bamboo dragonfly.

Matriarch Gu watched as Gu Qi left. She walked to the door and was about to close it when she realized that Gu Qi was running towards her.
