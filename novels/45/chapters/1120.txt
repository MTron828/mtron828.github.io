1121 Why should I be afraid of you?

Lu Qi shook her head and said truthfully, “Why should I be afraid of you? I just think you’re wrong. Everyone is a free individual. Everyone wants to live their own lives. Do you think Mr. Jiang will be happy if you forcefully add your thoughts to his? I’m unwilling to do so anyway. Moreover, in this era, everyone gets married because they’re willing. Forced marriages don’t last long, because there’s no love between them to begin with!”

When Jiang Chi heard Lu Qi’s words, his expression darkened. He frowned and said coldly, “First of all, my actions are indeed no different from those people. However, if I can make them suffer through this method, I’m still very happy!”

With that, Jiang Chi continued with a bloodthirsty smile, “Secondly, your thoughts don’t matter at all. These are my brother’s thoughts. How can he be dissatisfied?”

Lu Qi clenched her fists tightly. She had a bad feeling. “What do you mean?”

!!

Jiang Chi walked towards Lu Qi step by step, exuding a cold aura. There was a paranoid smile on his face. “I don’t need you to do anything. You just have to be my sister-in-law obediently!”

“Impossible!” Lu Qi blurted out.

“Then I can only use another method. Since you don’t want to live so much, go and see my brother. I hope the two of you can live happily in the underworld!” Jiang Chi stared into Lu Qi’s eyes and enunciated each word clearly.

Lu Qi instantly reacted.

If she agreed to Jiang Chi’s request, he would still let her live well. If she rejected his suggestion, Jiang Chi would kill her!

Lu Qi had never expected to encounter a ghost marriage, and she was even forced to get married!

However, when she saw Jiang Chi’s gaze, she felt a chill run down her spine.

His eyes were very cold, without a trace of warmth. Lu Qi frowned and turned to walk out.

She reached out to push open the door of the private room, but the bodyguard guarding the door grabbed her hand. Lu Qi struggled hard and frowned. “Let go of me!”

Before Lu Qi could react, she heard two more gunshots in a row. Her ears were numb!

This was the first time Lu Qi had encountered such a situation. She screamed loudly and covered her ears. She looked down and realized that the bodyguards who had been holding her arms had all fallen to the ground in a pool of blood.

The arms of the two bodyguards were still bleeding. The two of them lay on the ground and rolled around!

Lu Qi breathed heavily, and the uneasiness in her heart gradually grew. She turned her head inch by inch to look at Jiang Chi and saw him slowly putting away his pistol!

“They’re really too rough. They hurt my sister-in-law!” When Jiang Chi said this, a trace of annoyance flashed across his face!

The two bodyguards with injured arms stood up with difficulty and bowed to Jiang Chi. They said in unison, “I’m sorry, Young Master Jiang. It’s our fault for not protecting the clueless Second Young Madam well!”

Jiang Chi was clearly pleased by the words “Second Young Madam” mentioned by the two bodyguards. A smile flashed in his eyes as he said, “Alright, the two of you go and bandage yourselves!”

“Yes!”

“Yes!”

The two bodyguards opened the door of the private room and walked out, covering their arms.

Just as Lu Qi was about to run out, she saw two more bodyguards walking to the door of the private room. The two of them closed the door of the private room expressionlessly, closing Lu Qi’s hope of escaping.

Lu Qi had a feeling that if she didn’t agree to this man’s suggestion, he might kill her immediately.

She still remembered the first time she had encountered danger. At that time, she had been kidnapped by He Cheng. At that time, she had been in a panic and didn’t know what to do at all.

This was the second time Lu Qi had been in danger. She had never expected the other party to shoot without restraint. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The country did not allow people to use guns, but this man actually had a gun!

That meant that this man was either powerful enough to not fear the laws of the country, or he was an outsider who ignored the laws of the country.

No matter which he was, to Lu Qi, if she continued to resist, she might be shot to death!
