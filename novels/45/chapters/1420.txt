1421 Refused to Intercede

“Auntie Cao, Grandma is kind-hearted. She won’t slander a good person. Don’t worry about that.” Song Yu smiled at Auntie Cao and comforted her. “Don’t worry, Uncle Zhao was really framed. He’ll definitely be fine.”

“I hope so.” Auntie Cao lowered her gaze and sighed helplessly. She wanted Song Yu to return to the Lu family and put in a good word for Old Zhao, but what Song Yu meant was that she no longer planned to speak up for Old Zhao. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The more Auntie Cao thought about it, the more uneasy she felt. After some thought, she said, “Sixth Miss, I know Matriarch likes you a lot. Why don’t you put in a good word for Old Zhao? He especially doted on you in the past.”

The smile on Song Yu’s face did not change. She slowly put down her bowl and chopsticks, picked up a cup at the side, and took a sip of water. Only then did she say, “Auntie Cao, Grandma, Dad, and Mom will handle such a big matter. It’s not appropriate for me to speak up for Uncle Zhao at this time!”

She finally understood that this meal was not for nothing. Without waiting for Auntie Cao to speak, Song Yu continued, “Auntie Cao, the Lu family is very strict. Don’t tell me you don’t remember this!”

Hearing Song Yu’s words, Auntie Cao’s expression changed.

“When Mom is at home, even if our brothers make a mistake, they will be punished. If Uncle Zhao is really framed, I think the elders won’t be unable to distinguish right from wrong. What do you think?” Song Yu kicked the ball to Auntie Cao again and asked with a smile.

Auntie Cao had raised Song Yu since she was young, so she naturally knew that she was unhappy now. Hence, she changed the topic. “That’s true. I’m just too concerned. Sixth Miss, there are still many of your favorite dishes. Eat more. Look at you. You’ve lost weight again recently.”

Song Yu took out a tissue and slowly wiped the food stains from the corner of her mouth. She smiled and said, “Auntie Cao, I’ve been filming recently. I have to maintain my figure. I’ve already eaten a lot just now. I really can’t eat anymore.”

Song Yu’s intention to leave was already very obvious.

Auntie Cao’s expression changed slightly, then she gave an awkward smile and began to tidy up the lunch box on the table. “Alright, what else do you want to eat tomorrow? I’ll bring it over for you.”

“Auntie Cao, the house has been very busy recently. Just help at home. You don’t have to worry about me. I’m not young anymore. I can take care of myself,” Song Yu said politely.

Before Auntie Cao came, she thought that Song Yu might get angry with her suggestion, but there was nothing she could do. After all, she was really too worried about Old Zhao.

She packed the lunch box again and sat down opposite Song Yu. She said sadly, “Sixth Miss, I know what I said just now was a little inappropriate. That was because I was worried about Old Zhao. Old Zhao has worked hard for the Lu family his entire life, but no one expected him to be framed when he was old. This…”

As Auntie Cao spoke, she sighed helplessly. She stole a glance at Song Yu and saw that her expression had softened. Only then did she say, “I wasn’t worried about Old Zhao at first, because Matriarch Lu also trusted her very much. However, Matriarch Lu came and brought Eldest Miss’s three children with her. They are around Matriarch Zhao every day. I’m worried that Matriarch Lu might ignore Old Zhao…”

“Auntie Cao, don’t worry. Grandma knows what to do.” Song Yu was really impatient. She comforted her and said, “It’s a good thing that Sister’s children came to the house. Grandma won’t be angry all the time because of what happened previously.”

“Eldest Miss is a little too annoying. She went to Europe because she wanted to, and she even insisted on letting her in-laws stay with her family. She’s really too much!”

Song Yu smiled and said, “Grandma hasn’t seen her grandchildren yet. I think it’s good for Sister to let her children accompany Grandma. Auntie Cao, I’m a little tired.”

Auntie Cao left reluctantly. As soon as Auntie Cao left, Song Yu closed the door and her expression instantly darkened.
