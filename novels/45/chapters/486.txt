Chapter 487: Jealous?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Seeing that Gu Zhou was unwilling to let go, Qiao Nian tried to pull her hand back.

At this moment, the man tightened his grip, and Qiao Nian was caught off guard and fell into Gu Zhou’s arms.

The man exerted more force and pinned Qiao Nian against the wall.

Qiao Nian was shocked by Gu Zhou’s sudden action. Her face turned pale as she asked in surprise, “Gu Zhou, what are you doing?”

Gu Zhou’s slender fingers pinched Qiao Nian’s chin, and his gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s eyes. His voice was as cold as the winter frost, and there was a hint of anger in it. “Mrs. Gu, aren’t you a little too concerned about him now?”

Gu Zhou’s last word was slightly dragged out. It was thought-provoking.

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she was stunned. Her heart raced involuntarily. She had never expected Gu Zhou to have such a domineering side.

Was Gu Zhou jealous?

How could that be?

However, Gu Zhou’s words seemed to be reminding her of her current identity.

Gu Zhou let go indifferently and gently tucked Qiao Nian’s hair behind her ear. His expression was cold, but his voice was as gentle as ever. “Be good. Go back to the hotel and rest now. Leave the rest to me. As for the favor you owe, I’ll repay it for you!”

When Qiao Nian heard him, she seemed to have returned to five years ago.

The man had said the same things to her that night.

There seemed to be some resemblance in their voices.

Gu Zhou let go of Qiao Nian and said, “Chen Qing!”

Chen Qing, who had just walked over with a blanket, overheard Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian’s conversation.

He involuntarily tightened his grip on the blanket and shivered.

The Second Master was angry again.

Oh dear, is he going to make him stack up tiles again?’

At the thought of this, Chen Qing felt like he had nothing to live for.

Chen Qing bravely stepped forward and said, “Second Young Master.”

“Take Madam to the hotel to rest now.”

Fortunately, it wasn’t anything to do with the tiles.

Chen Qing secretly heaved a sigh of relief. He looked up at Qiao Nian and said, “Madam, let’s go.”

Qiao Nian nodded slightly and didn’t persist.

In Gu Zhou’s opinion, she had just transfused 500 milliliters of blood for Lu Zhu. If she continued to accompany Lu Zhu now, Gu Zhou might suspect that she had other feelings for him.

When Qiao Nian and Chen Qing reached the elevator, she turned to look at Chen Qing and asked, “Chen Qing, when did Gu Zhou come to An City?”

Qiao Nian asked this question because she wanted to confirm if the man from that night five years ago was Gu Zhou.

This was because Gu Zhou and that person’s voices were somewhat similar.

“Chen Qing?”

Seeing that Chen Qing had remained silent, Qiao Nian called out.

Chen Qing suddenly came back to his senses and said, “It should have been that winter three years ago. I remember that Matriarch Gu suddenly fell ill and was hospitalized. It was Miss Jiang Yue who called Second Young Master to come back.”

“Are you sure?”

“Of course I’m sure. Besides, Second Young Master has always been living in Qin City. Everyone in the Gu family knows about this!”

Qiao Nian frowned slightly and asked, “Has Gu Zhou been to An City before this?”

“No, at that time, Second Young Master’s grandmother was unwilling to let Second Young Master come here. She said that Second Young Master’s health wasn’t good and would pass his illness to Eldest Young Master. Therefore, Second Young Master has always lived in Qin City alone!”

When Qiao Nian heard Chen Qing’s words, her frown deepened.

How could Gu Zhou’s grandmother say such heartless words?

Right, she had heard Gu Zhou mention his grandmother before.

From what Chen Qing had just said, Gu Zhou’s grandmother probably did not like Gu Zhou.

Qiao Nian’s frown deepened.

She still remembered that Gu Zhou was afraid of women. In that case, was his illness related to his grandmother?

Seeing Qiao Nian frown, Chen Qing realized that he had said the wrong thing. He hurriedly said carefully, “Madam, can you not mention it in front of Second Young Master? If Second Young Master finds out I talked about his grandmother, he’ll definitely be angry. I’m afraid I’ll be in an even worse state!”
