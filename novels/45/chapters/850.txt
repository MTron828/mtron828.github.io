851 Misunderstanding

She was the precious daughter of a rich family, and the biological sister of the genius business magnate, Qiao Yu.

Many people envied her status.

The injustice in Qiao Xin’s heart eased a lot. In her high heels, she walked out arrogantly.

After Qiao Xin left, Qiao Yu and Qiao Nian were the only ones left in the room.

Qiao Yu’s expression was complicated. He looked up at Qiao Nian and asked calmly, “You didn’t ask me here today for that project, right?”

Qiao Nian couldn’t be bothered to feign civility with Qiao Yu. She asked directly, “I just want to ask you a question!”

“What question?”

“Were you the one who saved me when I fell off the cliff at the age of six?”

When Qiao Yu heard Qiao Nian’s question, he was slightly stunned. He met Qiao Nian’s cold eyes.

Qiao Nian’s tone wasn’t good, as if she was questioning him.

Qiao Yu picked up his coffee cup and took a sip before placing it on the table. He looked at Qiao Nian calmly and said, “Looks like you already know what happened back then. Why are you still asking?”

When Qiao Nian heard Qiao Yu’s words, her eyes darkened. Indeed, the person who had saved her back then wasn’t Qiao Yu, but Gu Chuan.

Gu Chuan’s personality seemed to exist for her.

Every time Gu Chuan appeared, he would tell her the same thing.

He had saved her life.

At that time, Qiao Nian had thought that Gu Chuan was a lunatic, forcing his imagination on her.

She also thought that he was a paranoid person.But now it seemed that Gu Chuan was just reminding her of the past, because he was just telling her a fact.

She had misunderstood Gu Chuan.

Qiao Nian felt the air gradually thin. She felt suffocated.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Chuan coldly and said, “You lied to me!”

Qiao Yu’s expression was calm, without a trace of uneasiness. He met Qiao Nian’s gaze fearlessly and enunciated each word clearly. “From the beginning, I’ve told you that it wasn’t me!”

When Qiao Nian heard Qiao Yu’s words, she was slightly stunned. Memories of her childhood gradually surged into her mind, gradually becoming clearer.

She remembered.

She remembered that Brother White Shirt had saved her back then. After that, she had fainted.

Later on, when she saw the young Qiao Yu walking in wearing a white shirt, Qiao Yu’s back was facing the sunlight. His face was also hidden in the shadows, and his hairstyle was very similar to Gu Chuan’s.

That was why she had always thought that Brother White Shirt was Qiao Yu.

When Brother White Shirt saved her back then, she clearly remembered that Brother White Shirt’s shirt was stained red with blood.

She had always been very grateful to him.

If it weren’t for him, she might have died long ago.

For the past ten years, she had always remembered the beauty of that time. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Moreover, she had always treated Qiao Yu as her savior and the most important person to her.

At that time, she felt that Qiao Yu’s feelings for her seemed to be a little different. Otherwise, she wouldn’t gradually alienate Qiao Yu.

Later on, she and Qiao Yu became passersby.

Five years ago, Qiao Xin had caused her to lose her virginity and be locked up in a mental hospital. At that time, Qiao Yu had chosen Qiao Xin without hesitation, but he was unwilling to believe her.

The little bit of gratitude she had for Qiao Yu disappeared.

Only now did she realize that Qiao Yu had never saved her from the beginning.

Qiao Nian’s lips curved up slightly, relieved.

Seeing the smile on Qiao Nian’s face, Qiao Yu’s heart felt empty. He asked uneasily, “Why are you smiling like that?”

In the past, Qiao Nian had been unwilling to be ruthless to Qiao Yu because he had saved her life after all.

She was not as heartless as she treated the rest of the Qiao family.

She would always remember that one good thing about Qiao Yu. Now that she thought about it carefully, when Qiao Yu went to look for her, he clearly knew who she was.

Qiao Yu also knew that she wanted to go home, but he had never helped her fulfill her wish.

Moreover, Qiao Yu hadn’t told her the truth, but he had been hiding it from her like she was a fool.

Now, it seemed that Qiao Yu was also one of the culprits. He was no different from the rest of the Qiao family.
