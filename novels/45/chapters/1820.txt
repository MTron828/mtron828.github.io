Chapter 1821 - 1821 Call Me Uncle

Gu Qi looked at his mommy in confusion. Just as he was about to say something, he saw Xiao Bao running over with red eyes.

Qiao Nian let go of Gu Qi and Xiao Shi and walked over quickly. She squatted down and hugged Xiao Bao.

At this moment, tears welled up in Xiao Bao’s eyes. He hugged her pitifully and sniffed hard, trying not to cry.

When Gu Qi and Xiao Shi ran over, they saw that Xiao Bao looked like he was about to cry.

Gu Qi looked warily at the man standing in the shade in the distance and frowned. “Xiao Bao, did he bully you? Don’t be afraid. I’ll get Uncle to come over now!”

During the time Gu Qi stayed in the Lu family, he was constantly brainwashed by Lu Zhu. He said that as long as they discovered any suspicious people or someone bullied them, they could just call Uncle.

In Gu Qi’s opinion, Lu Zhu was his eldest uncle and the eldest brother of the other uncles, so he believed Lu Zhu’s words without a doubt.

Qiao Nian turned to look at Gu Qi beside her and hurriedly explained, “Xiao Qi, you don’t have to call Uncle over.”

“He’s Uncle Chang Feng and he’s not a bad person.” Xiao Bao’s voice was filled with tears. Then, he closed his mouth and stopped talking.

Hearing Xiao Bao’s words, Qiao Nian knew that Xiao Bao still cared a lot about Eldest Senior Brother. She patted Xiao Bao’s back gently and coaxed him softly, “Hasn’t Xiao Bao always missed Uncle Chang Feng? Don’t you want to talk to Uncle Chang Feng?”

“No!” Xiao Bao refused without hesitation, his voice choked.

Xiao Bao raised his hand and secretly wiped his tears. He said loudly, “I don’t want my people who don’t want me. Not at all!”

The more Xiao Bao spoke, the sadder he became. Tears streamed down his face as he bit his lip and tried not to cry.

Qiao Nian looked at Xiao Bao and remembered that Eldest Senior Brother was worried that Xiao Bao would be sad, so he wanted to hide in the dark and leave after taking a look at Xiao Bao.

She gently comforted Xiao Bao’s back and said gently, “Xiao Bao, actually, the reason your Daddy and Uncle Chang Feng sent you here is to protect you. They didn’t want you to be hurt.”

When Xiao Bao heard Qiao Nian’s words, he cried and said, “Mommy, I understand, but I was waiting obediently for them to pick me up…”

Xiao Bao was already sobbing uncontrollably towards the end.

He liked Daddy and Uncle Chang Feng as much as he liked Mommy and Daddy.

Qiao Nian’s heart ached as she hugged Xiao Bao. Xiao Bao was smart and sensible, but he was a child after all. He probably felt aggrieved when he saw Chang Feng and thought about being “abandoned” previously.

Initially, Xiao Bao was only crying softly. Later on, he could not control himself and cried out loud.

The wind directly carried Xiao Bao’s cries into the distance.

When the two men, who had been strolling in the garden, heard the child’s cry, they immediately stopped in their tracks and their eyes were filled with worry.

Lu Nian took out his hand from his pants pocket and carefully identified the direction of the cry. “Who’s crying?”

This cry sounded like a child’s cry.

Lu Chen pointed in the direction of the cry and quickly walked over. “Maybe the three children are injured. Hurry up and call the family doctor.”

Lu Nian quickly followed. At the same time, he had already taken out his phone to call the family doctor.

After Lu Nian hung up, his expression turned solemn.

The three children were usually obedient and cute. They had never cried at all, let alone cry like this.

Something must have happened.

When Lu Zhu and Lu Nian arrived, they saw Qiao Nian hugging Xiao Bao, whose face was red from crying.

Gu Qi and Xiao Shi stood beside Qiao Nian.

“Sugar!”

As soon as Lu Zhu and Lu Nian spoke, they called out two different names.

However, the two of them quickly walked towards Qiao Nian and the others.
When she walked over, Lu Zhu’s heart softened when he saw Xiao Bao crying pitifully. His voice was much gentler than usual. “Why is Xiao Bao crying?”

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Zhu’s voice, she turned to look at him and said helplessly, “Xiao Bao…”

Things were a little complicated. It was not something that could be explained in a few words.
