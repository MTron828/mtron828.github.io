1440 Climbing the Mountain

Qiao Nian smiled and hurriedly said, “I think your chef has already tried his best to make Chinese breakfast. Our country is relatively big, and breakfast is different everywhere. You’re eating breakfast in An City now.”

“So there are so many things to pay attention to.” Lina looked like she had learned something. She thought about it seriously for a moment before saying, “Then I’ll ask my father to find another chef who knows how to cook food from An City.”

At the dining table, Qiao Nian and Lina were chatting and laughing.

After breakfast, Lina and Qiao Nian walked out. Chen Qing followed closely behind them. When Lina and Qiao Nian were about to get into the car, Chen Qing opened the door of the back seat first.

Chen Qing waited for Lina and Qiao Nian to get into the car before walking to the front passenger seat. He opened the door and got in.

Chen Qing turned to look at Qiao Nian and Lina and said gentlemanly, “Ladies, I’ll be in charge of your safety for the rest of the trip!”

Qiao Nian sat in the back seat and smiled at Lina. She said sincerely, “I’m really sorry for making you wait for me for so long just now.”

“Nian Nian, we’re good friends. You don’t have to be so polite!” Lina’s face was filled with smiles. Her eyes darted around as she said, “Speaking of which, I’m the one who should thank you. I even got the best breakfast in An City at your house today. Actually, my mother is also…”

Seeing that Lina had stopped mid-sentence, Qiao Nian didn’t ask further. Actually, she was also very curious about Lina’s mother, but she didn’t want to alert the enemy.

Lina said, “My mother is also Asian. She likes Asian culture the most, so I like Asian culture too.”

A gentle smile appeared on Qiao Nian’s face.

Could it be that Lina had wanted to say, “Actually, my mother is also from An City?”

Although she didn’t know why Lina had changed her words, she still smiled and said, “No wonder when I saw you yesterday, I felt that you had an Asian look. The cheongsam you were wearing yesterday was really too beautiful!”

“My mother usually likes to wear cheongsams the most, so I like to wear cheongsams too.” Yesterday, Lina wanted to wear the best cheongsam to woo the person she liked.

But she had never expected that the person she liked was already married.

Fortunately, Nian Nian was a magnanimous person and didn’t argue with her.

“Cheongsams are difficult to pull off. If your eyes weren’t blue, I would have thought that we were from the same country!” Qiao Nian said sincerely.

“My mother is also from Country Z, the same country as you. Unfortunately, I don’t look like my mother.” At this point, Lina sighed helplessly. If she could inherit her mother’s beauty, she could be a beautiful and elegant Asian beauty.

“You’re already very good-looking now.” As Qiao Nian spoke, she thought of Lina’s feet and asked, “Does your feet still hurt?”

“My foot recovered a long time ago!” Lina said with a smile. When she was young, her foot had been dislocated. After seeing a doctor, her foot hurt for a full week. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Just because of this, she felt that Qiao Nian was simply a divine doctor.

Qiao Nian smiled and said, “That’s good. We still have to climb the mountain today. If you’re not feeling well, we’ll go another day!”

“I’m really fine!” As Lina spoke, she recalled Chen Qing’s words in the living room.

Qiao Nian’s medical skills were especially brilliant. If Qiao Nian knew that she had a favor to ask of her, would she think that she didn’t really want to be friends with her?

She really wanted to be friends with Qiao Nian, and hoped that Qiao Nian could treat her mother’s illness.

If they had been friends for several years, she would definitely have made this request without hesitation.

Lina couldn’t help but sigh.

When Qiao Nian heard Lina sigh, she looked at her conflicted expression and asked with a smile, “What’s wrong? Are you unhappy?”

When Lina heard Qiao Nian’s words, she looked up at her and met Qiao Nian’s gentle and concerned eyes. Her frustration instantly disappeared.
