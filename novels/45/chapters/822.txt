823 Worried for Xiao Shi

“Huh? Could it be that she already suspects Xiao Qi’s identity?” Lin Tao asked in surprise.

Xiao Shi, who was standing beside Lin Tao, looked worried. She stared unblinkingly at Lin Tao, who was on the phone. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“She doesn’t suspect Xiao Qi’s identity. Lin Tao, get Xiao Shi to pick up the phone!” Qiao Nian said.

Lin Tao’s phone had been placed outside. When she heard Qiao Nian’s words, she handed the phone to the impatient Xiao Shi.

When Xiao Shi took the phone, she thought that nothing had happened. She called out happily, “Auntie Nian Nian!”

“Yes!”

Xiao Shi asked excitedly, “Auntie Nian Nian, have you seen my mommy?”

When Qiao Nian heard Xiao Shi’s voice, she sighed helplessly and said, “I just saw your mommy, but there was a small misunderstanding between me and your mommy. I wonder if your mommy will be angry.”

Qiao Nian felt that it was necessary to clarify these things in advance.

Xiao Shi had been holding his phone with both hands. When she heard Qiao Nian’s words, she recalled her mommy’s angry expression.

Xiao Shi pursed her lips slightly and asked worriedly, “Brother Xiao Qi, are you alright? Were you frightened by Mommy?”

Qiao Nian’s phone was also on speaker.

She could tell from her words that she cared about Gu Qi, but there was a trace of sadness.

At this moment, Qiao Nian completely realized that Song Man might have often lost her temper at Xiao Shi in the past.

Xiao Shi knew Song Man’s temper well, so she was worried that Gu Qi would be hurt.

Qiao Nian didn’t know how Xiao Shi had survived, nor did she know how she had dealt with Song Man’s situation. She couldn’t help but worry about her.

Gu Qi wanted to reply to Xiao Shi, but she didn’t want Xiao Shi to be sad, so he looked at Qiao Nian for help.

Qiao Nian received Gu Qi’s signal, so she comforted Xiao Shi. “Don’t worry, your brother is fine!”

When Xiao Shi heard Qiao Nian’s words, she couldn’t help but blame herself. She said guiltily, “I’m sorry, Auntie Nian Nian. My mommy isn’t in a good mood. I’ve caused you trouble!”

When Qiao Nian heard Xiao Shi’s words, her heart ached uncontrollably.

Xiao Shi’s words were mixed with guilt, but her words were very coherent, as if she had said it many times in the past.

Xiao Shi was clearly just a child. Could it be that when she was with Song Man in the past, she often apologized to others because Song Man was unstable?

Qiao Nian’s heart couldn’t help but ache. She was just a five-year-old child. Why did she have to suffer so much?

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but ask, “Xiao Shi, why don’t you not go back first…”

Holding the phone with both hands, Xiao Shi shook her head and rejected Qiao Nian’s suggestion. “Auntie Nian Nian, I have to go back!”

Qiao Nian frowned. She recalled how Song Man had looked when she hit Gu Qi. She hesitated for a moment and asked, “Why don’t we let Auntie Lin Tao accompany you back?”

Qiao Nian was really worried about Song Man being alone with Xiao Shi.

She really couldn’t bear to see Song Man hit her.

Xiao Shi clenched her fists and hesitated for a moment. Auntie Nian Nian and Auntie Lin Tao had already helped her a lot. She shouldn’t trouble them anymore. She shook her head and said obediently, “Auntie Nian Nian, don’t worry. I’ll go back myself. Mommy won’t do anything to me. After all, she’s my mommy. She takes good care of me. She loves me very much.”

Qiao Nian paused for a moment. She didn’t know what to say. She was Gu Qi’s legal mother now, so it was only right for her to take care of him. No matter where this matter went, no one could find fault with her.

However, Xiao Shi’s guardian was Song Man now. She had nothing to do with her. If she took her away, she might break the law.

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian’s frown deepened.

“Xiao Shi, if anything happens, call me!” Qiao Nian instructed worriedly.

After Qiao Nian hung up, Gu Qi’s frown deepened.

At the thought that his sister was going back to face Song Man, his heart jumped to his throat. He asked worriedly, “What if she hits my sister?”
