Chapter 1627 Threat

Cui Qi smiled self-deprecatingly. He naturally understood what Qiao Nian meant. If he died, no one would be able to send Mark to prison.

In the past, his life had been very relaxed, but ever since he found out the truth, he no longer had the energy from before. It was as if he was already old.

Cui Qi looked up at Qiao Nian and said weakly, "Thank you for your concern, Miss Qiao. I'll be fine. If the president can clear my father's name after Mark's incident, I'll definitely be especially grateful to you."

With that, Cui Qi's expression suddenly changed. He looked at Qiao Nian with a dark expression and enunciated each word clearly. "If you lie to me, I'll definitely drag you all down one by one before I go to the slums. I'll let you know the consequences of lying to me!"

Gu Zhou looked at Cui Qi's vicious gaze and subconsciously shielded Qiao Nian behind him. His eyes were cold, and his body exuded a cold aura of death.

Cui Qi had a cold smile on his face. "Mr. Gu, actually, I just want the president to clear my father's name. That's all. As long as I get what I want, I won't do anything."

He paused for a moment before continuing, "Otherwise, you'll live in fear for the rest of your lives. You have to know that I have nothing to lose."

Cui Qi meant that no matter how guarded Gu Zhou was, there would always be times when he would miss something. He would spend his life killing them.

His face was disfigured. When he smiled, he looked like a demon from hell.

When Gu Zhou heard Cui Qi's words, his narrow eyes were filled with coldness. He said in a low voice, "I think General Cui is mistaken. Back then, it was Earl Mark who saved you from the burning house and spent so much effort raising you. If you come out, shouldn't thanking him be the first thing you do?"

Gu Zhou's words were like a cold dagger stabbing into Cui Qi's chest. Cui Qi gritted his teeth and said, "I know everything in my heart. I'll settle my debts one by one."

Gu Zhou's gaze fell on Cui Qi's face and he said calmly, "After such a big incident, your family is the one who needs your protection. Don't forget to take your family away before you do anything. Otherwise, if you fall into the hands of others, you won't even have the right to say no."

Qiao Nian could tell that Gu Zhou was giving Cui Qi a warning. She looked at Cui Qi. He was already so angry and didn't know who to trust.

She looked at Cui Qi and said seriously, "Cui Qi, I think you should believe the president. Elders won't stoop to the level of a junior. According to the crimes you've committed, your crimes are unforgivable. If it were anyone else, you might have to meet your father in death."

She paused for a moment and continued, "However, the president is willing to let you leave because he doesn't want you to return here. He has never wanted to deal with your family. You should be wary of those with ulterior motives."

She walked up to Cui Qi and looked down at him. She asked, "Do you think you'll put a family member who once colluded with the enemy and committed treason and embezzlement in an important position? The president placed you in an important position because he trusted you, and you haven't trusted him until now."

When Cui Qi heard Qiao Nian's words, the hostility in his body gradually dissipated. He slowly lowered his gaze and pursed his lips.

Qiao Nian was right. If a person made a mistake, he wouldn't put that person in an important position, let alone let his family member enter his army. He would be afraid that that person would leak the secret.

So the president had always treated him as a junior!

Gu Zhou looked at Cui Qi, who had his head lowered. He sighed slightly and took Qiao Nian's hand as they walked out. When they reached the door, he glanced at Chen Qing, who was standing not far away, from the corner of his eye. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

When Chen Qing heard Gu Zhou's words, he hurriedly said, "Second Young Master, don't worry. I'll definitely watch over him personally until dawn. Nothing will happen."

Qiao Nian looked at Chen Qing, her eyes filled with relief. "It's been hard on you during this period."

"It's my duty," Chen Qing said seriously.
