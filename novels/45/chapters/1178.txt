1179 Ulterior motives

When he reached Widow Wang’s door, he knocked hard. When he heard a voice from the door, he thought that Widow Wang had come to open the door, so he left.

Thank you readers!

It had taken him about ten minutes to get out of the forest.

“You’re quite fast at digging pits!” The bodyguard teased when he saw Shen An approaching.

Shen An pretended to be very sad and sighed heavily.

The bodyguard brought Shen An back, but he still covered Shen An’s eyes with an eye mask.

When he returned to his original spot, the woman wanted to see him. The bodyguard brought him to her.

“I heard that you personally disposed of that little b*tch’s corpse?”

The woman’s voice sounded a little happy, as if she really wanted Little Lu Nian to die.

“Yes, I’ve already buried her corpse!” Shen An pretended to be sad. He clenched his fists tightly and asked, “I’ve done everything you wanted. Where’s my daughter? Shouldn’t you return her to me?”

“Why are you in a hurry? Although you said that you had dealt with that little b*tch’s corpse, I suddenly remembered something.” The woman pretended to be in a difficult position.

Shen An had a bad feeling about this. He frowned and asked, “What is it?” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“If that b*tch continues to live, the police will definitely continue to look for her. You have to think of a way to get the police to close the case!” The woman smiled at Shen An. She stood up and walked up to Shen An. She moved closer to his ear and said, “You should be the best at things like forensics.”

“Do you want me to bring her corpse back?” Shen An said with a frown. “She’s already dead now. Her corpse is useless to you!”

“Why? With her corpse, the Lu family won’t look for her anymore, and the police station will close the case!” the woman asked in confusion.

“It’s very simple. She just finished a bone marrow transplant. If her body is discovered, the forensic doctor will definitely find out that she has finished a bone marrow transplant. If the police follow this lead, won’t they still find you?” Shen An paused for a moment and continued, “Why don’t we just treat her as if she’s missing?”

“Missing? The Lu family has really benefited!” The woman gritted her teeth and said, “I don’t care. You have to think of a way to do as I say. You have to let the Lu family think that she’s dead!”

Shen An’s mind was in a mess. Only at this moment did he realize that this woman definitely had other motives!

What exactly was this woman trying to do?

“How about this? Go and dig up Lu Nian’s corpse and take a section of her arm. The forensic doctor shouldn’t be able to find out that her bone marrow has been extracted,” the woman said viciously.

“No,” Chen An said mercilessly. “If it were in the past, your method would work. However, I’ve written a report about the corpses of people whose bone marrow was extracted. The blood in their bodies is different from the blood of ordinary people. Just by examining her arm, it can be determined that her bone marrow had been extracted!”

Shen An stood there and thought for a while before saying, “I remember that one of your daughter’s arms is already dead. I think it should be able to replace Little Lu Nian’s arm.”

“Can it?” The woman raised her eyebrows slightly and asked worriedly.

“Her bone marrow has been swapped. The blood in her body is identical to Little Lu Nian’s. No one will find out that her bone marrow has been swapped. Typically, forensic DNA tests rely on drawing blood points. Even if someone wants to use her skin for a test, I can help you stop them. Moreover, no illness will be found in her blood. This is the only way.”

After a long time, Shen An heard the woman’s voice. “Are you sure nothing will go wrong?”

“My daughter is still in your hands. Would I dare to lie to you?” Shen An pretended to be calm as he spoke.
