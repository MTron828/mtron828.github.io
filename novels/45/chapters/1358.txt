1359 Back?

Gu Zhou stood at the door of the room, looking travel-worn. His gaze fell on Qiao Nian, who was lying on the bed. She was wearing light pink pajamas, and his eyes gradually darkened. He casually closed the door and walked towards her, staring unblinkingly at her.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in shock and blinked in a daze. After a long while, she came back to her senses and asked in surprise, “Why are you back now?”

When he approached, he was still cold.

Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou. “Why didn’t you tell me in advance? I could have picked you up… um.”

Before she could finish speaking, Gu Zhou pressed Qiao Nian onto the bed and kissed her lips without hesitation.

His lips were slightly cold.

Qiao Nian blinked in confusion and looked at Gu Zhou in a daze. She wanted to push Gu Zhou away, but when she thought of the wound on Gu Zhou’s abdomen, she stopped.

Gu Zhou pulled off the scarf around his neck and pressed himself against Qiao Nian, not giving her a chance to escape.

Qiao Nian was pressed against the bed and inadvertently cried out. Her lips parted slightly, and Gu Zhou took the opportunity to move closer.

Her mouth was filled with Gu Zhou’s scent. She slowly closed her eyes, her heart beating faster and faster.

Just as Qiao Nian was about to suffocate, Gu Zhou let go of her lips. Her clothes had already loosened, and Gu Zhou was only left with a shirt.

Qiao Nian’s face was flushed red. She took deep breaths, her beautiful fox-like eyes tinged with charm.

Gu Zhou looked down at Qiao Nian, who was below him. Seeing her charming appearance, his eyes were filled with joy. He reached out and touched Qiao Nian’s face, his voice tinged with suppressed desire. “Nian’er.”

Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou. With just one glance, her face instantly turned red, and his eyes burned with fire.

She licked her lips nervously and swallowed. “It’s getting late. You’re tired after coming back. Hurry up and take a shower and sleep.”

Her voice sounded ambiguous and extremely gentle.

“I’m not tired.” Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian. Her voice seemed to be seducing him, and his lips curved up slightly. “I took a shower before I came. Moreover, I slept very well on the plane. I’m not sleepy at all now. I just want to sleep with you.”

Gu Zhou’s voice was low and hoarse, filled with ambiguity. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, her heart skipped a beat

He had yet to recover from his injuries, but he had rushed back from MY because he wanted to…

Qiao Nian’s face grew redder and redder. She turned her head to the side, afraid that the matter would blow up. She said in a low voice, “Alright, stop fooling around. Hurry up and sleep!”

“Didn’t you say that you missed me?” Gu Zhou’s voice was sexy and seductive. His hand slid down Qiao Nian’s face to her collarbone, caressing it gently. “Of course I have to come back. I can’t leave you alone in an empty room.”

Qiao Nian felt her entire body heat up.

Gu Zhou continued, “Just once.”

Qiao Nian still wanted to refuse, but Gu Zhou had already kissed her lips, blocking all her objections.

The night was long and left a lasting impression.

…

The next morning.

Qiao Nian woke up in Gu Zhou’s arms.

Sunlight filtered through the curtains and fell on his face. His entire body seemed to be covered in a faint layer of golden light, and he felt warm.

Qiao Nian still remembered the first time she had seen Gu Zhou. At that time, she felt that Gu Zhou was a cold and unapproachable person, but she had never expected the two of them to be so close.

Gu Zhou opened his eyes slightly and looked at Qiao Nian with a smile in his eyes. He moved closer to Qiao Nian and lowered his head to kiss her forehead. Indistinctly, he said, “Nian’er, sleep a little longer.”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in surprise. This was actually Gu Zhou’s first time lazing in bed.

Perhaps it was because Gu Zhou had yet to recover, but he insisted on being with her last night…

Qiao Nian chose a comfortable position in Gu Zhou’s arms and continued sleeping.

After an unknown period of time, Qiao Nian was woken up by her phone ringing.

When she woke up, she was the only one left on the bed. Gu Zhou seemed to have woken up long ago.
