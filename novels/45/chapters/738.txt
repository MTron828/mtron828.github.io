Matriarch Gu looked at Gu Qi lovingly. When Gu Qi ran over, she squatted down gently.

Gu Qi looked exactly like Gu Zhou when he was young.

“Xiao Qi, what’s wrong?”

Gu Qi handed the box in his hand to Matriarch Gu.

A trace of surprise flashed in Matriarch Gu’s eyes. She took the box from Gu Qi and realized that he had given her a pair of glasses.

When she opened the case, there was a pair of glasses inside.

“Great-Grandma, your glasses,” Gu Qi said seriously, looking up at Matriarch Gu.

Matriarch Gu looked at Gu Qi in disbelief. She didn’t expect Gu Qi to give her a gift and was a little flattered.

She took out the glasses from the case and inadvertently touched the lenses. Only then did she realize that these lenses were different from her previous ones.

It should be a new product from the glasses company.

When Matriarch Gu put on her glasses, she realized that everything around her had become clearer. Her gaze fell on Gu Qi’s face.

She could clearly see the distinct eyebrows on Gu Qi’s face.

A trace of surprise flashed in Matriarch Gu’s eyes.

She was getting on in years, and her eyesight was poor.

She also had reading glasses, but the effect of those reading glasses was not as clear as the one Gu Qi had given her.

Matriarch Gu smiled at Gu Qi and asked, “Xiao Qi, where did you buy these glasses?”

When Gu Qi heard Matriarch Gu’s words, he said seriously, “Great-Grandma, I made these glasses myself.”

When Matriarch Gu heard Gu Qi’s words, a trace of surprise flashed across her eyes.

Only then did she notice that the frame of this pair of glasses was made of bamboo, the same material as the bamboo dragonfly in Gu Qi’s hand.

Matriarch Gu touched the glasses in her hand. She was very curious about who Gu Qi’s mother was. She had actually given birth to such a clever son!

Matriarch Gu slowly squatted down. She looked at Gu Qi and said gently, “So our Xiao Qi is so smart and capable!”

A trace of a smile flashed in Gu Qi’s eyes, but his little face was still tense. He said seriously, “Great-Grandma, I’ll go play first!”

With that, Gu Qi turned to leave.

Matriarch Gu looked at Gu Qi’s small face and felt a little sad.

Although Gu Qi was a child of the Gu family, for his safety and because Gu Qi’s background was not legitimate, they could only raise him outside.

Matriarch Gu took Gu Qi’s hand and asked seriously, “Xiao Qi, do you like your Auntie Nian Nian?” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

When Gu Qi heard Matriarch Gu’s question, he blinked his big black grape-like eyes and nodded without hesitation.

He liked Auntie Nian Nian a lot. If only he could be with her forever. He wondered if his father would be with Auntie Nian Nian.

Matriarch Gu looked at Gu Qi’s expression and couldn’t help but smile. Then, she asked seriously, “Then do you want to be with Auntie Nian Nian forever?”

Gu Qi hurriedly nodded.

Seeing Gu Qi like this, Matriarch Gu smiled and said, “Then are you willing to let Auntie Nian Nian be your mother?”

Gu Qi lowered his eyes slightly. After a while, he asked, “Great-Grandma, can I have two mothers?”

Matriarch Gu looked at Gu Qi in confusion, not understanding what Gu Qi meant.

Gu Qi said seriously, “If Auntie Nian Nian becomes my mother, what about my biological mother? She’s my mother too, right? In other words, I have to have two mothers at the same time?”

“That’s right. Our Xiao Qi is right. If Auntie Nian Nian becomes your mother, you’ll have two mothers!” Matriarch Gu smiled at Gu Qi. She finally understood that Gu Qi was still young and did not understand what she meant.

Matriarch Gu held Gu Qi’s hand. She didn’t want to lie to Gu Qi and explained, “Your biological mother was your first mother. Even if she comes back, she’s still your mother. You’re also her most beloved child. However, if Aunt Nian Nian is your mother, it means that she wants to marry your father.”

Gu Qi narrowed his eyes slightly, looking thoughtful.

Matriarch Gu continued, “If your biological mother returns, she just won’t be your father’s wife. It doesn’t affect you being her child.”
