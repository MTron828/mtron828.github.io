Could it be because of his sister?

Lu Qi’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face.

That was true.

A wedding was very important to a woman.

!!

Brother Ah Zhou’s family did not lack money, so holding a wedding was not difficult for him.

The more Lu Qi thought about it, the angrier she became. Brother Ah Zhou was too perfunctory with her sister. Her sister was too easy to talk to! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

No, she had to seek justice for her sister.

Seeing that something was wrong with Fourth Brother’s expression, Qiao Nian hurriedly explained, “Fourth Brother, this is because of me.”

Lu Jiang clearly didn’t believe Qiao Nian’s words. He shook his head gently and said, “You don’t have to find an excuse for him!”

“Back then, I wanted to keep our marriage a secret, so I suggested it directly,” Qiao Nian said eagerly.

Back then, when she married into the Gu family on behalf of Gu Zhou, she wanted to leave after treating Gu Zhou’s illness. At that time, she was still thinking about how to discuss a divorce with Gu Zhou!

Lu Jiang was slightly stunned, and a trace of surprise flashed in his eyes. However, he quickly calmed down and said unhappily, “He shouldn’t have agreed to your secret marriage!”

Qiao Nian was speechless.

“Only by preparing the best wedding for his wife can a man really give her happiness for the rest of his life. He’s really scheming. Does he just want to take advantage of you and not take responsibility?” The more Lu Jiang thought about it, the angrier he became. He gripped the steering wheel tightly.

In any case, he would not wrong his wife. If he had a wife, he would definitely give her the best things in the world. Then, he would express his love for his wife in front of everyone and make a promise to be with her for the rest of his life!

Gu Zhou just didn’t value his sister.

Lu Qi sat in the back seat and nodded vigorously. She agreed with Lu Jiang very much and hurriedly said, “Sister, a man can’t give you a wedding, can’t introduce you to everyone and can’t make a promise to take care of you and love you for the rest of your life in front of everyone. He’s a bastard, a scumbag!”

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Qi’s words, she couldn’t help but laugh. “You’re still young.”

Lu Qi shook her head, then said seriously, “Sister, you just have to look for Mom and Dad. Don’t speak up for Brother Ah Zhou. He did something wrong, but he still has a chance to correct himself!”

Qiao Nian’s heart silently ached for Gu Zhou. She really didn’t want her family to go against Gu Zhou, so she said, “Actually, I strongly requested for the secret marriage. It really has nothing to do with him!”

“Why?” Lu Jiang didn’t understand.

“Yes, Sister. Why did you marry Brother Ah Zhou in secret? Don’t you want to marry Brother Ah Zhou in a wedding dress under everyone’s witness?” Lu Qi asked in confusion.

Qiao Nian smiled faintly. “Back then, I married Gu Zhou as a replacement. At that time, I didn’t have any feelings for him, so I wanted to keep the marriage a secret!”

The car came to a sudden stop.

Lu Jiang drove the car to the side of the road and looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief.

Replacement?

What era was this?

How could this have happened?

Lu Jiang didn’t hide the heartache in his eyes. It seemed that his sister had suffered all these years outside.

The eldest daughter of the Lu family, the favorite of the Lu family!

With this thought in mind, Lu Jiang frowned and said, “Since you don’t have any feelings for Gu Zhou, this matter will be easier to handle. This time, we’ll help you pack your things. Let’s go home!”

What?

Home now?

Qiao Nian really admired Fourth Brother’s ability to execute things. She couldn’t help but explain, “Brother, we didn’t have any feelings for each other back then, but it’s different now. We already have feelings for each other.”

The confusion in Lu Jiang’s eyes was even more obvious. He asked, “Since you already have feelings for her, why haven’t you held the wedding?”

Lu Qi blinked innocently and said, “Sister, don’t listen to men’s excuses. The man who really loves you will definitely give you an unforgettable wedding!”

Although she was not in a relationship yet, she yearned to wear a pure white wedding dress and walk towards her Prince Charming step by step.

How romantic was marriage!

“Sister, a wedding is very important. It can’t be ignored! Men only hide the existence of a woman when they don’t like her,” Lu Qi said seriously. “Don’t be deceived by Brother Ah Zhou!”
