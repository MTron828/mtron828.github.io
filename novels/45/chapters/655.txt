Chapter 656: Enough!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Su Sheng couldn’t help but blush. She had never expected her senior sister to tell her everything she was most unwilling to admit. She was so embarrassed that she yearned to find a hole to hide in.

She felt that Qiao Nian must be extremely smug now. She must be watching her make a fool of herself.

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Qing’s voice, she suppressed the discomfort in her heart. Previously, she had already had a good impression of Gu Qing. Now that she heard Gu Qing’s words, Qiao Nian nodded. “Yes.”

Seeing Qiao Nian like this, Su Sheng’s expression instantly darkened.

Since her senior sister had spoken so nicely, Qiao Nian responded indifferently. However, this made her understand one thing.

Qiao Nian had really been invited over by Mr. Dong Hua. At the thought of this, Su Sheng felt very uncomfortable.

If it weren’t for her senior sister, she wouldn’t have been able to come here. However, Qiao Nian had been personally invited by Mr. Dong Hua.

This difference made Su Sheng feel terrible.

Seeing that Qiao Nian’s expression had improved, Gu Qing smiled and continued to smooth things over. “Since you were also invited by Ah Nian, you must have received his permission. I think this is just a misunderstanding.”

As Gu Qing spoke, she turned to look at Su Sheng and said sternly, “Sheng Sheng, you should learn to be more mature. Don’t be so impulsive!”

Su Sheng had rarely seen Gu Qing so strict. She immediately felt aggrieved, and her eyes gradually turned red. She said unhappily, “Senior, even if she was invited by Mr. Dong Hua, she can’t touch his piano casually!”

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Su Sheng’s face, and her beautiful fox-like eyes instantly turned cold. She finally understood. Su Sheng probably didn’t want her to be invited over by Mr. Dong Hua and she didn’t want to believe this either.

“Shut up!” Gu Qing’s face instantly darkened as she whispered angrily.

She had never expected Su Sheng to be so unreasonable today.

Su Sheng looked at Gu Qing in disbelief. His senior sister was actually scolding her again because of Qiao Nian.

Had she said anything wrong?

It was clearly Qiao Nian’s fault.

Su Sheng was really furious. She said angrily, “Senior Sister, you shouldn’t always help her. If Mr. Dong Hua comes and finds out that Qiao Nian casually used his piano, Mr. Dong Hua will blame her. Moreover, I’m just telling the truth. She touched someone else’s things without his permission. This is wrong to begin with. She should apologize to Mr. Dong Hua.”

Gu Qing’s eyes narrowed and darkened.

She couldn’t understand why Su Sheng was so concerned about Qiao Nian touching Mr. Dong Hua’s piano.

When she came in previously, Gu Qing had noticed that Lu Nian was looking at Qiao Nian differently.

Moreover, with Lu Nian here, it was not Su Sheng’s place to step forward and be self righteous.

“Su Sheng…”

Before Gu Qing could finish speaking, Qiao Nian spoke.

Qiao Nian looked at Su Sheng coldly. Suppressing her anger, she questioned, “What has it got to do with you whether I apologize or not? You’re a busybody!”

Su Sheng’s face turned green with anger. Just as she was about to teach Qiao Nian a lesson, she heard the man beside her speak.

“Enough!”

The man’s voice was cold and mixed with a trace of anger as he interrupt Su Sheng.

At this moment, the air in the room became weaker and weaker, and it was a little suffocating.

Su Sheng looked at the man in a daze. The man’s voice was really too pleasant to the ear. It made her feel as if she was about to get pregnant.

Gu Qing heaved a sigh of relief. She looked up at him and said apologetically, “Ah Nian, I’m sorry.”

Ah Nian?

Su Sheng’s eyes widened involuntarily as she looked at Gu Qing in shock.

How was this possible?

This young and handsome man was actually Mr. Dong Hua.

Su Sheng gasped, feeling a little dizzy.

She had never expected Mr. Dong Hua to be so handsome. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

She was willing to marry Mr. Dong Hua now.
