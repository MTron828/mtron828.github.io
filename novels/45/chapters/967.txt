968 You Laughed

“Gu Chuan is me, and I’m also Gu Chuan. Whether it’s me or Gu Chuan, we’re all waiting for you.” Gu Zhou continued, “You’ve been wandering outside for many years. What happened to us six years ago might have been a test given to us by the heavens. Fate has long tied us tightly together. Even if we cross time and space, we are still tied tightly together.”

Qiao Nian’s uneasy heart gradually calmed down. Sometimes, she sighed with emotion at fate. Her fate with Gu Zhou was really extraordinary.

“Do you still remember what you asked me at the hospital?” Gu Zhou asked.

Qiao Nian no longer had time to think about what had happened back then. She looked at Gu Zhou in confusion.

!!

Seeing Qiao Nian’s adorable expression, Gu Zhou couldn’t help but laugh.

His voice was low, but his voice rose slightly at the end. It was especially seductive.

“When did I like you?” Gu Zhou reminded her kindly.

Qiao Nian suddenly recalled the situation back then. She wanted to get up from Gu Zhou’s lap, but this man’s hand was still on her waist. Unable to struggle, she said casually, “Don’t tell me it was when you bit my face!”

Qiao Nian regretted her words.

Oh my god!

At that time, she was still a baby who only knew how to eat, drink, and shit. What charm could she have? Moreover, Gu Zhou had been beaten up because of this.

She was about to change her answer when she met Gu Zhou’s gentle eyes. For a moment, she forgot what to say.

“I still remember the first time I saw you. At that time, you were just a month old. Grandpa Lu carried you over. At that time, I looked at your face and reached out to touch it. I couldn’t help but kiss you. However, I didn’t have any experience, so it turned into a bite!”

Qiao Nian’s pupils instantly dilated as she looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief. She hadn’t expected Gu Zhou to have been thinking about her since she was a baby!

This man was too much!

Gu Zhou was amused by Qiao Nian’s expression. He moved slightly closer to her mouth and kissed her lightly. Seeing her face gradually turn red, he chuckled. “Actually, I didn’t even remember this in the past. Later on, after interacting with you for a long time, I inadvertently remembered.”

Qiao Nian almost suspected that there was something wrong with Gu Zhou’s mind.

“I think at that time, I probably thought that you were soft and sweet, so I wanted to taste you.”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou and smiled. For some reason, she felt a little sad.

Zhou Zhou had always wanted to eat candy, but he had never eaten it.

However, in the novels she had read in the past, domineering CEOs were all arrogant. Why was her CEO always thinking about eating candy when he was young?

Gu Zhou didn’t know what Qiao Nian was thinking about with her unpredictable expression. He said seriously, “When you cried, I realized that you weren’t candy. You were like the especially good-looking doll I had seen. No, at that time, you were basically a doll.”

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but laugh out loud. “You must have been beaten up by my brothers. Let’s see if you still dare to bite me!”

Seeing Qiao Nian smile, Gu Zhou smiled. His lips curved up slightly as he said, “Nian’er.”

“Hm?”

“You’re laughing!”

The smile on Qiao Nian’s face froze, then gradually disappeared.

Gu Zhou had been paying attention to her emotions. Was that why he had said those things in the past in a relaxed and casual tone to make her laugh?

Qiao Nian pursed her lips and said seriously, “You were still so young back then. How could you still remember this?”

“The most important and profound memories will always be remembered. I remember this very clearly.” Gu Zhou smiled and said sincerely.

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze slightly. She recalled some fragmented memories of her past when she was three years old.

She remembered listening to Second Brother play the piano in Second Brother’s piano room. Although she couldn’t see Second Brother’s face clearly, she remembered every note.

She still remembered the first time she saw Su Xue. Those memories gradually came back to her. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Gu Zhou looked around, his gaze finally landing on Qiao Nian’s face. “Face of the fear in your heart so you won’t be afraid in the future!”
