Chapter 10: Too Noisy!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Yes, I’m a ‘wild man’. Father-in-law and Mother-in-law, don’t call me ‘son-in-law’ in the future.” Gu Zhou’s thin lips parted as he spoke, his voice cold. He walked towards the sofa, unconcerned.

Qiao Xin looked at Su Xue worriedly. A trace of cunning appeared in her eyes. She stood up and said, “Second Young Master, Mom didn’t mean that. She just…”

“You’re all too noisy.” Gu Zhou shot a glance at Chen Qing, who was standing behind him.

Chen Qing nodded slightly and stepped towards Qiao Xin. Ignoring the shock on Qiao Xin’s face, he gave her a vicious slap across the face.

The crisp sound of the slap reverberated throughout the drawing room.

Qiao Shan and Su Xue were both stunned. They looked worriedly at Qiao Xin, but didn’t dare to move, nor show any dissatisfaction with Gu Zhou’s actions.

Qiao Xin stood there blankly, blood rushing to her face. This was the first time in her life that she had been hit by a man!

Tears rolled down her cheeks, and Qiao Xin began to feel more and more aggrieved. Her eyes were filled with hatred for Qiao Nian, for she simply didn’t dare to hate Gu Zhou.

Qiao Nian, who was standing beside Gu Zhou, was also stunned. She had never expected that Gu Zhou would directly instruct his subordinate to hit her. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

However, this slap was really satisfying!

Gu Zhou didn’t even bother granting Qiao Xin a glance. He walked to the sofa and sat down without invitation, pulling Qiao Nian to do so as well. He said lightly, “I won’t allow my wife to be criticized by others.”

Just by sitting there, Gu Zhou exuded such a strong oppressive aura that Qiao Shan and Su Xue did not dare to move one bit.

Qiao Nian obediently sat down beside Gu Zhou. She was here as a spectator anyway.

Qiao Shan and Su Xue exchanged a look. Although their hearts ached for Qiao Xin, they knew with certainty that if they angered Gu Zhou, the entire Qiao family would be ruined. Thus, neither of them dared to speak up.

With eyes like bottomless pools, Gu Zhou glanced at the coffee table. A hint of disdain flashed in his eyes as he said, “We’ve arrived quite some time ago, yet not even a cup of tea has been prepared. Do Father-in-law and Mother-in-law object so greatly to our marriage?”

“We – we – we don’t object!” Qiao Shan stammered out. This was the first time he had seen someone with such a powerful presence, and he found himself practically suffocating merely from his aura.

Qiao Xin glanced at Qiao Shan with teary eyes. Softly, she spoke, trying to ease the predicament. “Brother-in-law, it’s a misunderstanding. Mom and Dad…”

“Chen Qing!” Gu Zhou called out casually, interrupting Qiao Xin.

“Pa!” Without hesitation, Chen Qing flung another slap at Qiao Xin. There were now two identical hand-prints on each side of Qiao Xin’s face.

The corner of Qiao Xin’s mouth had begun to bleed. She tried to seem pitiful, but her swollen face just reminded one of a pig’s head.

Seeing that Qiao Xin had been slapped again, Su Xue pulled Qiao Xin behind her and gave her a look.

Qiao Xin turned pale. She lowered her head, not daring to say another word.

Hastily, Qiao Shan ordered the servants to serve tea. He stood beside Gu Zhou and began to fawn over him. “Second Young Master, do stay for lunch before taking your leave!”

“There’s no need. It’s too noisy here.” Gu Zhou glanced at Qiao Xin who was standing not far away, then retracted his gaze. Holding onto Qiao Nian’s hand, he began to play with her fingers, his expression indifferent. “About the bride you sent me. Was she sent to the mental hospital five years ago because of the chaos in her private life?”

Actually, Gu Zhou didn’t like to touch other people, but Qiao Nian seemed to be an exception. Whenever he touched her, she was always warm and the warmth would flow through his entire body.

Gu Zhou looked down at the delicate hand in his and his expression darkened. He just hoped that she wasn’t sent by those people!

Qiao Nian wanted to retract her hand, but Gu Zhou was holding on too tightly. She could only resign herself to fate.

Hearing his words, Qiao Nian looked up slightly and caught Qiao Shan and Su Xue’s guilty expressions.

Qiao Shan rubbed his hands together uneasily. Seeing how intimate Gu Zhou was with Qiao Nian, he knew that Gu Zhou didn’t dislike Qiao Nian.

But when he thought of what Gu Zhou had said about the “chaos in her private life”, he panicked. What if news of Qiao Nian’s pregnancy got out?

When Qiao Shan thought of how Gu Zhou had treated Qiao Xin, he could not help but shiver, his scalp going momentarily numb. He broke out in a cold sweat and swallowed nervously.

Meanwhile, Qiao Xin’s eyes glinted. If Second Young Master Gu was aware that Qiao Nian was a loose woman, would he dislike Qiao Nian? Then, would Qiao Xin be the one sitting next to Gu Zhou instead?

Qiao Xin pictured herself sitting next to Second Young Master Gu in an expensive dress. The Gu family was so rich, and Second Young Master Gu was neither ugly nor short-lived, unlike what the rumors said. Then she would be the Second Young Madam of the Gu family.

Qiao Xin began to say something, but her gaze accidentally fell on Chen Qing’s face, and she was forcibly reminded of how Chen Qing had slapped her. Quickly, she lowered her gaze to hide the hatred in her eyes.

She could not speak without thinking.. It would be bad if she provoked Second Young Master Gu again.
