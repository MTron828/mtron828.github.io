Chapter 639: Getting Words Out

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian looked at Chen Qing in confusion and called out, “Chen Qing.”

When Chen Qing saw Qiao Nian, he hurriedly walked towards her. “Miss Qiao.”

Due to Gu Zhou’s previous arrangements, whenever Chen Qing saw Qiao Nian, he would address her as Miss Qiao.

Seeing Chen Qing walk over, Qiao Nian was about to speak when she smelled a faint pungent smell from Chen Qing.

She looked at Chen Qing in confusion and asked, “Where did you go just now?”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s question, Chen Qing was on the verge of tears. He didn’t know what was wrong with Second Young Master either. Recently, he had been constantly being punished. “There’s a house being renovated. I went over to keep an eye on it.”

How was he watching it? He had clearly gone over to put up the tiles.

However, he couldn’t say this out loud.

Qiao Nian instantly understood. She didn’t expect Chen Qing to do so much work on a daily basis.

She thought of Gu Zhou’s multiple personalities. Only Chen Qing knew about this, so Chen Qing had to stay by Gu Zhou’s side.

“In the future, you should arrange for someone else to handle such matters. You just have to stay by Gu Zhou’s side, understand?” Qiao Nian said.

Chen Qing also wanted to agree, but his words carried little weight. In front of Second Young Master, he didn’t dare to say a word.

If he spoke, it might not be just a matter of putting up tiles for a day. It might be a week or a month.

Seeing Chen Qing’s troubled expression, Qiao Nian thought for a while and said, “I’ll talk to him.”

“Thank you, Miss Qiao. I’ll definitely stay by Second Young Master’s side.” Chen Qing was extremely excited. If he continued to put up the tiles, his waist might be crippled.

He was not married yet. He had to protect his waist well.

“You have to think of a way to help Gu Zhou hide his multiple personalities. I’m worried that if others find out, they might harm him,” Qiao Nian instructed in a low voice.

“Yes.” Chen Qing’s expression turned serious.

“By the way, where is Second Young Master now?”

“He’s in the study now. I’ll take you there,” Chen Qing said calmly, feeling extremely happy.

“Okay.” Qiao Nian agreed.

The two of them walked towards the stairs on the second floor. When they reached Gu Zhou’s study, Chen Qing knocked on the door for Qiao Nian, then stood aside expressionlessly.

“Come in.”

Gu Zhou’s cold voice came from the office.

Qiao Nian pushed the door open and walked in. Her gaze met Gu Zhou’s deep eyes. His eyes were like the starry sky of the universe, unfathomable.

Gu Zhou sat lazily on the sofa, his right leg crossed over his left. His hand rested slightly on the sofa and the snake was sitting in his palm.

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. He asked, “Why are you looking for me?”

He raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at Qiao Nian with interest.

Qiao Nian walked to the sofa and sat down.

She touched the snake’s head. When the snake saw Qiao Nian, it coiled itself seductively around her hand.

“I’m just here to take a look at it.” As Qiao Nian spoke, her gaze fell on the snake in her hand. She was conflicted about how to ask Gu Zhou about his relationship with the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

Gu Zhou had once been engaged to the eldest daughter of the Lu family. Qiao Nian was very curious. Had the two of them met?

Based on the relationship between the Gu family and the Lu family, she felt that they should have met before.

However, neither Matriarch Gu nor Lu Zhu were willing to say anything about Gu Zhou meeting the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

Hence, she could only look for Gu Zhou directly. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Suddenly, Qiao Nian smelled a faint fragrance. She turned her head and realized that Gu Zhou was already sitting beside her.

She met Gu Zhou’s bottomless eyes, and her heart began to race involuntarily.

“Why are you looking at me like that?” Gu Zhou lowered his gaze, looking down at Qiao Nian.

“Nothing.” Qiao Nian smiled and handed the snake to Gu Zhou. “Has it gained weight again?”

Gu Zhou’s eyes darkened. He didn’t expose Qiao Nian’s lie. Instead, he continued, “It seems to have gained some weight.”

“In the past, I never understood why the Gu family and the Lu family of An City were tied for first place. Only after Grandma told me about the past did I understand why.” As Qiao Nian spoke, she kept looking at Gu Zhou.
