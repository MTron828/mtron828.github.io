Chapter 531: Successful Scheme

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian swallowed nervously. She didn’t know if it was her imagination, but she felt that Gu Zhou seemed to be in a good mood.

His frustration was gone?

Moreover, it seemed that his scheme had succeeded?

Qiao Nian coughed and pretended to be calm. Her gaze fell on Chen Qing, who was in the driver’s seat. She said softly, “You’re driving while you’re tired!”

Chen Qing was speechless.

He was innocent!

How was he tired of driving? Although he had slept standing outside last night, the quality of his sleep was quite good.

Besides, he was clearly frightened by Second Young Master’s words just now, okay?

Chen Qing also realized that there was a faint fragrance in the car. It seemed to be the smell of shower gel, but it was not strong and smelled especially good.

No wonder Second Master, who usually relied on smoking to resolve his frustration, was no longer willing to smoke.

Chen Qing couldn’t say this either. He could only nod respectfully and say, “I’ll take note in the future. Sorry for startling Madam.”

Only then did Qiao Nian sit back down. As if she had thought of something, she silently distanced herself from Gu Zhou.

This man was simply too terrifying. Before she could react, he had already done everything.

Gu Zhou’s slender fingers gently touched the jade in his hand. The frustration in his heart had completely disappeared.

About half an hour later, the car arrived at the hospital.

Just as they walked into Lu Zhu’s ward, they heard the nurses at the nurses’ station whispering.

“Did you know that the patient in Ward Eight died last night!”

‘What? You mean the bank heiress?’

“That’s right!”

“I thought her illness wasn’t life-threatening. How could—”

“Sigh, she wasn’t honest either. Before she recovered, she was already jumping around everywhere. Then, she sat in a wheelchair. I don’t know what happened, but she fell down the stairs. The stitches on her wound burst open, and she bled profusely. She died immediately!”

“Poor thing. Her wound was in her womb. It hurts just thinking about it.”

“Who knows? She’s just showing off every day. Just because she’s the daughter of a bank entrepreneur, she’s running around everywhere. She doesn’t even listen to us nurses.”

“Ah, what a pity!”

… .

When Gu Zhou heard what those people said, his eyes instantly turned cold. He lowered his voice and said in a voice that only the two of them could hear, “Did she bully you again?”

Qiao Nian’s expression was calm as she said, “Previously, she was injured in Ghost City. Due to this, her uterus was gone, and she blamed this on me. She tried every means to make things difficult for me. Is this considered bullying?”

Qiao Nian thought of what Song Yue had done. Even though Song Yue was dead, she still couldn’t forgive her.

Gu Zhou asked, “Did you do it?”

Qiao Nian shook her head gently and said, “Brother Zhu.”

Gu Zhou could not help but frown. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Brother Zhu.

It was Brother Zhu again.

The three of them headed for the ward door.

Gu Zhou and Chen Qing looked at each other in surprise.

Especially Gu Zhou.

He had known Lu Zhu for so many years, but he had never seen Lu Zhu attack a woman. Moreover, Lu Zhu had directly taken that woman’s life.

What puzzled him the most was that Lu Zhu had only made a move because of Qiao Nian.

In his memory, before Lu Zhu came to MY, he didn’t get along well with Qiao Nian. He didn’t have a good impression of her either.

The transformation was earthshaking.

Gu Zhou frowned.

Qiao Nian didn’t think too much about it. The thought of her brother being alone in the hospital last night made her worry.

She wondered if her brother was getting better.

As they approached the door of the ward, Qiao Nian immediately quickened her pace and walked in front of Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou gradually slowed down. Looking at Qiao Nian’s anxious back, he whispered to Chen Qing, “Chen Qing.”

Chen Qing looked up at Gu Zhou. “Second Young Master?”

Gu Zhou narrowed his eyes slightly and asked, “Chen Qing, don’t you think that Qiao Nian treats Lu Zhu a little differently?”
