Chapter 481: Skimming Over Their Relationship

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Hearing Lu Zhu’s words, Qiao Nian realized that her attitude just now was a little abnormal.

This must be the so-called confusion of concern.

Her enthusiastic attitude earlier did seem misleading to others.

However, looking at Lu Zhu’s cold attitude, Qiao Nian still felt a little uncomfortable.

She had always thought she would never lose her composure again.

The light in Qiao Nian’s eyes gradually dimmed, but she quickly regained her usual composure. With a calm expression, she said, “You were injured so badly because you saved me. I just didn’t want anything to happen to you because of me!”

After Qiao Nian’s explanation, the atmosphere in the ward eased considerably.

Lu Zhu looked at Qiao Nian calmly and smiled.

“Fortunately, you arrived in time and saved me from Jiang Chi, so you don’t have to take it to heart!”

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Zhu’s words, she nodded and heaved a sigh of relief. However, she didn’t want Lu Zhu to draw a line between them. She said, “That’s true, but you were still injured because of me!”

Lu Zhu still said calmly, “Even if it’s an ordinary person, I’ll do my best to save him, not to mention that you’re Gu Zhou’s wife. Moreover, I’ve already promised him to protect you. You don’t have to take this to heart.”

Hearing Lu Zhu’s words, Qiao Nian knew that Lu Zhu didn’t want Gu Zhou to misunderstand their relationship. “Thank you.”

Lu Zhu narrowed his eyes slightly. In a daze, he recalled how Qiao Nian had helped him out of the Ghost City. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

For some reason, he found the word “thank you” rather heavy.

Lu Zhu had a strange feeling in his heart, but in the end, he did not say anything.

Qiao Nian looked away indifferently, unwilling to speak again.

Gu Zhou looked at Chen Qing and said calmly, “Get me a cup of hot water.”

Chen Qing said, “Yes.”

Gu Zhou very naturally adjusted the bed. Just as he fixed the angle of the bed, Chen Qing came in with a cup of water. He handed the cup to Lu Zhu and said, “Drink some water first.”

Lu Zhu did not reject Gu Zhou’s suggestion. He took two sips and returned the cup to Gu Zhou.

At this moment, Xu Qian stood at the door and knocked.

Chen Qing said, “Please come in.”

Seeing that Lu Zhu had woken up, Xu Qian heaved a sigh of relief. She took the electronic thermometer to the bed and said, “I’ll take your temperature now.”

Gu Zhou nodded.

Chen Qian held the electronic thermometer and pressed it on Lu Zhu’s forehead. After hearing the electronic sound, she retracted the thermometer.

“Your temperature is normal now. You’re out of danger. You have to rest well next. Try to eat lightly.”

Lu Zhu said indifferently, “Thank you.”

Xu Qian nodded, her gaze falling on Qiao Nian’s face. Although she knew that Qiao Nian was a doctor, she couldn’t help but remind her as a nurse, “Doctor Qiao, don’t let Mr. Lu eat anything tonight. He can only drink some hot water. We’ll feed him some porridge tomorrow morning!”

Qiao Nian nodded and said gratefully, “Thank you!”

Xu Qian was slightly taken aback.

She found it hard to imagine that a gentle and polite person like Qiao Nian was actually a mistress who ruined other people’s relationships.

However, Xu Qian quickly reacted and said calmly, “You’re welcome. This is what I should do.”

Qiao Nian smiled gently.

After Xu Qian finished speaking, she didn’t leave immediately. Instead, she stood there with her notebook, thinking about how to help Song Yue hide the fact that Qiao Nian had given Lu Zhu a blood transfusion.

“Nurse Xu, can we speak further?”

Qiao Nian’s voice interrupted Xu Qian’s thoughts.

Xu Qian smiled and nodded. “Okay.”

When Xu Qian and Qiao Nian came out of the ward, Qiao Nian didn’t forget to close the door.

Qiao Nian glanced around. The corridor was very quiet. There was no one else.

Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. Only then did her gaze fall on Xu Qian’s face.
