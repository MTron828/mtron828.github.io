937 Brother, I was Shot

Su Xue was a nurse. She knew how to take care of a patient, but at this moment, she still listened to the doctor’s instructions seriously.

Su Xue nodded and said gratefully, “Alright, thank you, Doctor. I know what to do.”

After the doctor left, the nurses pushed Qiao Xin’s bed out of the emergency room.

At this moment, Qiao Xin had already woken up. When she saw Su Xue, Qiao Shan, and Qiao Yu, the tears she had been holding back instantly welled up. She burst into tears.

“I thought… I thought I was going to die and never see you again. Sob, Mom, I’m so scared…” Qiao Xin was in tears. Her pillow was already wet from her tears.

When Su Xue heard Qiao Xin’s words, her heart instantly ached. She grabbed Qiao Xin’s hand and said gently, “Be good. It’s fine. Don’t cry. It’s fine. The doctor said that you’ll be able to walk normally after some time!”

Seeing Qiao Xin like this, Qiao Shan felt extremely sad. He nodded.

When Qiao Xin heard Su Xue’s words, she thought about how she would be able to walk like a normal person in the future and secretly rejoiced.

At this moment, Qiao Xin recalled Lu Zhu’s cold face, as well as how Lu Zhu had shot her in the leg without hesitation with a pistol. A chill instantly ran down her spine. She was so frightened that she burst into tears, and the more she cried, the worse she became.

Qiao Yu, who had been standing by the wall, frowned slightly when he saw Qiao Xin like this. He put away his phone and walked towards Qiao Xin.

Seeing Qiao Yu walk over, Qiao Xin wiped her tears and complained pitifully, “Brother, I’ve been shot. I…”

“Shut up!” Qiao Yu said coldly.

The nurses pushing Qiao Xin’s bed were frightened by Qiao Yu’s gaze. None of them dared to speak.

Qiao Xin was also stunned. This was the first time she had been scolded by her brother.

Qiao Xin immediately burst into tears, completely disregarding her image. She didn’t look like a rich young lady at all.

When they arrived at the ward, the nurses settled Qiao Xin down and left.

Only the four members of the Qiao family were left in the ward.

Qiao Xin cried the entire way. Along the way, only Su Xue comforted her. She didn’t understand why her brother was so fierce to her. Now that there were no outsiders around, she said unhappily, “Brother, why are you so fierce to me? Do you still have me in your eyes?” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Qiao Yu didn’t speak, his face covered in frost.

“I’ve already been shot. You should help me—”

Slam!

Qiao Yu slapped Qiao Xin hard, interrupting her.

Qiao Shan and Su Xue were both stunned!

At this moment, Qiao Xin had already been beaten silly. She looked at Qiao Yu in disbelief. Just as she was about to speak, Qiao Yu gave her a sharp look, scaring her speechless.

The room was so quiet that one could hear a pin drop.

Su Xue looked at Qiao Yu in surprise. In her impression, her son had always been gentle and refined. He doted on Qiao Xin the most. Why would he hit Qiao Xin?

A clear palm print gradually appeared on Qiao Xin’s pale face. She looked at Qiao Yu with red-rimmed eyes and shouted, “Brother, are you crazy? How dare you hit me!”

Ever since she was young, Qiao Xin had grown up being doted on by the Qiao family.

“What did you do?” Qiao Yu glared at Qiao Xin coldly, questioning her!

Qiao Shan frowned at Qiao Yu and said angrily, “How can you speak to your sister like that? Your sister is still injured. How can you hit her? You should be thinking of making the person who bullied your sister pay with his life!”

Su Xue sat by the bed and pulled Qiao Xin into her arms. Her heart ached as she looked at the palm print on Qiao Xin’s face. “Qiao Yu, you’re the older brother. You should give in to your younger sister. Your sister has just come out of the emergency room. How can you bear to hit her?”

Qiao Yu didn’t even look at Qiao Shan and Su Xue. His gaze was fixed on Qiao Xin. Seeing Qiao Xin’s aggrieved expression, he said coldly, “Six years ago, you tried your best to drug Qiao Nian and ruin her. Six years later, you’re still using the same trick. This time, you found a few men to ruin Qiao Nian. Qiao Xin, do you think you’re already above the law?”

When Qiao Xin heard Qiao Yu’s words, her eyes widened. “Brother, you hit me because of that b*tch!”
