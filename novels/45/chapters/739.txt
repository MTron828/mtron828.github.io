740 Heartache

When Gu Qi heard Matriarch Gu’s words, he nodded seriously and said, “Yes, I want Auntie Nian Nian to be my mother.”

When Matriarch Gu heard Gu Qi’s words, her lips curved up involuntarily. She nodded gently. “What a good child.”

Gu Qi looked at Matriarch Gu seriously and asked curiously, “Great-grandmother, is Auntie Nian Nian willing to let me be her son?”

Hearing this, Matriarch Gu couldn’t help but feel her heart ache for Gu Qi. She looked at Gu Qi as if she was looking at Ah Zhou from many years ago.

Matriarch Gu clearly remembered that at that time, Ah Zhou was like a medicine jar. The purpose of his life was to provide medicine for his brother.

She had been taking care of Ah Zhou. Once, Ah Zhou asked her carefully, “Grandma, doesn’t Mom and Dad like Zhou Zhou?”

At that time, before she could answer, Ah Zhou was taken by his mother to have his blood drawn.

Matriarch Gu’s eyes couldn’t help but tear up. She raised her hand to wipe her tears, then smiled at Gu Qi and said gently, “Xiao Qi is so smart and adorable. Everyone likes Xiao Qi. Your Auntie Nian Nian is also willing to be your mother. However, leave this matter to Great-Grandma. I’ll definitely give you a satisfactory answer!”

When Gu Qi heard Matriarch Gu’s words, his eyes lit up.

He would have a mother in the future!

He had a father and mother like all the other children in kindergarten.

“Thank you, Great-grandmother.” Gu Qi’s eyes were sparkling like the stars in the darkness, making one unable to look away.

Matriarch Gu patted Gu Qi’s head and asked him to play.

Gu Qi ran away with the bamboo dragonfly in his hand.

Seeing that Gu Qi had walked far away, the smile on Matriarch Gu’s face slowly disappeared. She walked into her room, took out her phone, and called the butler.

“Madam!”

“Call Second Young Master over.”

With that, Matriarch Gu hung up.

At this moment, the butler realized that Matriarch Gu’s attitude was a little bad. A trace of surprise flashed in his eyes, but he still went to look for Second Young Master obediently.

Matriarch Gu sat back down on the rattan chair. She picked up the calendar on the table beside her and slowly flipped through it.

She wanted to find an auspicious day so that Gu Qi could acknowledge his ancestors.

This matter had already wronged Gu Qi and Qiao Nian. She felt that Gu Zhou shouldn’t continue like this. Instead, he should tell Qiao Nian the truth.

Matriarch Gu looked at the calendar in her hand. Qiao Nian’s face flashed across her mind, and she couldn’t help but sigh again.

Qiao Nian was a good child. If she knew that Gu Qi was born to Gu Zhou and another woman, she wondered if she would be angry.

What if Qiao Nian got angry?

According to Qiao Nian’s personality, it was very likely that she would leave directly.

At this moment, Matriarch Gu seemed to be standing at the crossroads. She was in a dilemma, not knowing where to go.

She wanted to clear Gu Qi’s name and let him acknowledge his ancestors so Gu Qi would not feel insecure.

She still wanted Qiao Nian to be Gu Qi’s mother, but she was worried that Qiao Nian would be sad when she found out.

Matriarch Gu’s frown deepened. She did not know what to do either.

Just as Matriarch Gu was deep in thought, there was a knock on the door.

Matriarch Gu came out of her thoughts and said to the door, “Come in!”

Gu Zhou pushed open the door and walked in. He greeted, “Grandma.” Then, he closed the door. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

When Matriarch Gu saw Gu Zhou, her expression instantly darkened. She said angrily, “I have something to tell you!”

Gu Zhou looked at Matriarch Gu in confusion. He noticed that Matriarch Gu was very angry and was a little surprised. Just as he was about to speak, he noticed that Matriarch Gu had a new pair of glasses on her nose.

“Grandma, the doctor instructed you not to be angry.” As Gu Zhou spoke, he walked over to Matriarch Gu and sat down. “Grandma has changed her glasses!”

When Matriarch Gu heard Gu Zhou’s words, the anger on her face dissipated a little. She bragged happily, “Doesn’t this pair of glasses look good?”

Gu Zhou nodded.

“Xiao Qi gave it to me. He made it himself!” Matriarch Gu said proudly.
