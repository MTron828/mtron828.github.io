Chapter 553: Gu Qi Is an Exception

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Seeing how serious Qiao Nian was, Gu Zhou’s eyes were filled with worry. Moreover, as Qiao Nian spoke, she would touch Gu Qi’s forehead from time to time to see if he had a fever again. She seemed to treat Gu Qi as her own child.

Gu Zhou narrowed his eyes and asked in a low voice, “Don’t you dislike children?”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she turned to look at him. She met his gaze openly and said, “That’s someone else. Gu Qi is an exception.”

Gu Zhou’s thin lips pursed into a straight line. He stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian, his eyes filled with complicated emotions.

For some reason, Qiao Nian felt that Gu Zhou’s gaze was a little hot. She retracted her gaze uncomfortably and stood up to walk out. “I’ll go to the medicinal room to get the medicine for him now!”

“Ok!”

After Qiao Nian walked out of the bedroom, her heart still ached for Gu Qi.

She really didn’t like children, but Gu Qi was really an accident.

Perhaps it was because of Gu Qi’s personality, or perhaps it was because Gu Qi’s experience was similar to hers, but she couldn’t help but feel sorry for him.

Moreover, she had already found her family, but Gu Qi had yet to find his mother. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Her relatives had never looked for her, but that was because everyone in the Lu family thought that she was already dead. They thought that she would no longer exist in this world. Under such circumstances, if it were her, she would not look for her either.

But why didn’t Gu Qi’s mother look for him?

Did Gu Qi’s mother also think that he was dead?

How could there be so many coincidences in this world?

Actually, it was also possible that she treated Gu Qi so well because Gu Qi was about the same age as her child who had never seen the world.

She couldn’t help but fall in love with Gu Qi.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian walked to the medicinal room. Just as she was about to return with the medicine, a figure blocked her path.

Qiao Nian looked up and saw Jiang Yue’s beautiful face.

Jiang Yue’s beautiful eyes were fixed on Qiao Nian’s face. Her lips curved up slightly, and a strange smile appeared in her eyes. She said, “Second Sister-in-law, long time no see!”

Jiang Yue still looked overbearing.

Qiao Nian looked at Jiang Yue indifferently, as if she was looking at a nobody.

Jiang Yue’s skin was truly extraordinarily thick. She actually dared to come here again.

Qiao Nian lowered her voice, her eyes filled with mockery. “Jiang Yue, I have to remind you now that from last month onwards, you no longer have anything to do with the Gu family. You shouldn’t be in his grandmother’s villa. Also, please don’t call me Second Sister-in-law anymore, because I’m not related to you in any way.”

Jiang Yue said disapprovingly, “Second Sister-in-law, you’re too confident. Grandma has raised me for more than ten years, and the kinship between us can’t be severed. However, you’re only Brother Ah Zhou’s wife. If Brother Ah Zhou wants to marry someone else, you can only abdicate your position. When that happens, you won’t have any say in the Gu family.”

At this point, Jiang Yue took a step forward and stood in front of Qiao Nian. She looked up at Qiao Nian, her expression cold. Her lips curved up slightly as she sneered. “What do you think everyone will think if they find out that you have an illegitimate child?”

Jiang Yue looked extremely arrogant.

Illegitimate child?

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned.

Her illegitimate son?

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but laugh. She looked at Jiang Yue sympathetically, as if she was looking at a beggar. She said, “Jiang Yue, no matter what happens, evidence is important. Do you think Grandma will believe your nonsense? I advise you to leave obediently. I can chase you out of here countless times. Do you want to try?”
