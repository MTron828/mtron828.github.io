Chapter 475: Fainted

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. She stared quietly at Lu Zhu’s face as the nurses’ cheers faded away.

She felt her eyelids grow heavy and her vision gradually blurred. Then, she fell to the side uncontrollably and lost consciousness.

Xu Qian was the first to notice that something was wrong with Qiao Nian. She hurriedly supported her and shouted anxiously, “Quick, come and help! Doctor Qiao has fainted!”

When the other nurses heard Xu Qian’s voice, they quickly surrounded her. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“What happened? Why did Doctor Qiao pass out?”

“I don’t know, Doctor Qiao. Wake up!”

“Hurry up and help Doctor Qiao out!”

… .

The emergency room was outside the operating room.

Gu Zhou stood calmly by the wall and waited for the situation inside to be settled.

At that moment, the door opened.

Gu Zhou looked up and saw the nurses helping the unconscious Qiao Nian out.

Gu Zhou frowned and asked coldly, “What happened?”

“She needs fresh air now. Help her to the window!”

Hearing this, Gu Zhou walked forward without hesitation. He bent down and carried Qiao Nian in his arms, quickly walking towards the window.

Seeing this, Xu Qian said, “Maybe it’s because she was so nervous during the surgery that she fainted!”

When Gu Zhou heard this, his eyes narrowed slightly and his voice deepened. “How much blood did you draw?”

When the blood was drawn, Xu Qian was not in the operating theater, so she turned to look at her colleague, Li Na, and asked, “How much blood was drawn?”

Li Na was twenty-three years old and had just graduated from university. She was innocent and not good at lying. When she heard Xu Qian’s question, she quickly lowered her head.

In the past, she wanted to live her life simply, but she never expected that she would be involved in a feud between wealthy families.

Although she was unwilling to lie, Li Na was still a little afraid when she thought of Qiao Nian’s cold gaze.

Li Na quickly calmed herself down. She looked up at Xu Qian and said with a serious expression, “Doctor Qiao was very persistent and offered 500 milliliters of blood!”

When Xu Qian heard Li Na say this, she immediately exclaimed, “Don’t you understand? Giving too much blood is not good for her health. Are you trying to kill her?”

Xu Qian knew that Li Na was an honest child, so she did not expect her to lie.

In addition, Qiao Nian’s face was pale and she had fainted. She looked like she had donated too much blood.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian’s pale face, his eyes deep.

Although Gu Zhou was not a medical student, he had heard that blood donations could not exceed 400 milliliters. Otherwise, it would cause harm to the body.

In an instant, Gu Zhou exuded a cold aura.

Li Na stood to the side, trembling with fear and guilt. Her voice trembled as she said, “I’m sorry. We’ve already persuaded her not to do this, but Dr. Qiao insisted on transfusing so much blood. She said that it didn’t matter if she transfused a little more because she would slowly recover. But if Mr. Lu doesn’t have blood, he might lose his life. We couldn’t stop her!”

Li Na had said this according to Qiao Nian’s original words. She only hoped that she could leave this place as soon as possible and get away with it.

Gu Zhou’s frown deepened, and his grip on Qiao Nian tightened involuntarily.

Qiao Nian had always been like this. As long as it was someone she cared about, she would do anything.

At this moment, a female nurse walked over with a bottle of glucose. She swiftly broke the bottle and was about to feed it to Qiao Nian.

“Let me do it!” Gu Zhou placed Qiao Nian on a stool near the window and took the glucose from the nurse.

Seeing this, the nurse did not insist.

Li Na looked at Gu Zhou carefully, trembling in fear.

She felt that Gu Zhou’s aura was a little too strong. She was still a little breathless standing beside him.
