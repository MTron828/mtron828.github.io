986 When Did You Get Married?

His memories of his childhood were a little blurry.

He often heard from his grandmother that he liked to be mischievous with Third Brother when he was young. At that time, every time he was scolded, his sister would speak up for them.

Due to their anger, their parents did not bring them out to buy toys. Instead, they brought their sister out to buy toys. Their sister would always help them buy their beloved toys and bring them back!

However, his sister’s face was a little blurry in his memory. He only knew that her sister was soft and cuddly. When she smiled, she was especially adorable. That was why she was called Sugar. She was as sweet as sugar.

Later on, for some reason, his sister disappeared and became a photo that was kept in the same room.

No wonder he couldn’t help but want to save her at the Red Bar. So it was because of their blood ties.

He and his sister had always been connected.

When Lu Jiang saw Qiao Nian’s photo on his brother’s phone, he found her familiar, but he couldn’t remember where he had seen her before.

Now he finally understood why she looked familiar.

He and Qiao Nian were triplets. Although they were fraternal, they were still very similar.

Moreover, Qiao Nian looked like his mother when she was young.

Retracting his thoughts, Lu Jiang smiled at Qiao Nian and said gently, “Eldest Miss, it’s cold outside. Get in!”

When Qiao Nian heard the words “Eldest Miss”, she felt inexplicably shy. Every time Fourth Brother called her that, she could hear the doting tone in his words.

Qiao Nian sat in the front passenger seat. Lu Qi obediently got into the back seat, and Lu Jiang sat in the driver’s seat.

Lu Qi looked at Lu Jiang curiously and asked, “Fourth Brother, let’s go home now. We can let Grandma and Third Brother see Sister too!”

“Let’s go to your sister’s house first.” Lu Jiang fastened his seatbelt as he said this. He wanted to see how his sister was doing at home.

Lu Qi nodded obediently and did not notice Lu Jiang’s thoughts at all.

Qiao Nian looked at Lu Qi in confusion and asked, “Why are you going to my house?”

“To get my suit jacket!” Lu Jiang answered matter-of-factly.

Qiao Nian didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. Fourth Brother really couldn’t wait a moment!

Lu Jiang turned to look at Qiao Nian and asked, “Where do you live?”

Qiao Nian obediently gave him the location.

Lu Jiang’s expression instantly turned serious. He frowned and asked, “The Gu family?”

Qiao Nian nodded and said, “Yes!”

Lu Jiang’s frown deepened. He suddenly recalled that when his brother introduced Qiao Nian to him with the photo, he remembered that Qiao Nian had already married Gu Zhou.

The sister he had just found had actually become Gu Zhou’s wife.

He turned to look at Lu Qi. Lu Qi nodded and said, “Yes, Brother Ah Zhou’s wife is Sister…”

Initially, Lu Qi didn’t think much of it, but after saying that, she couldn’t help but feel terrible.

Sister was got married just like that?

The sister she had just found was already someone else’s wife.

Lu Jiang recalled the relationship between the Gu family and the Lu family. Gu Zhou should have told everyone that he was getting married, but he hadn’t heard anything about it.

Lu Jiang looked at Qiao Nian and asked, “When did you get married?”

“We just registered.”

Lu Jiang felt very uncomfortable. He frowned and asked coldly, “Why didn’t you hold a wedding?”

Lu Jiang’s tone was cold, as if he was very unhappy that they did not hold a wedding.

However, it indirectly reflected that Fourth Brother really cared about her and was defending her.

Qiao Nian explained, “Actually, we…”

When Lu Jiang heard this, he felt a little sad. His sister was married, and her heart belonged to someone else.

His sister could tolerate it, but as her brother, he couldn’t. Hence, Lu Jiang said, “I have something to look for him about!”

How could the eldest daughter of the Lu family suffer like this?

His sister was the best sister in the world. Was she so embarrassing?

Qiao Nian was speechless.

It wasn’t easy for Gu Zhou to gain the recognition of her eldest and second brothers. She didn’t know how Third Brother would react if he found out about her relationship with Gu Zhou, but Fourth Brother seemed to be very dissatisfied. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Lu Qi’s eyes were filled with confusion. She remembered that Fourth Brother and Brother Ah Zhou had a good relationship back then. They often played together when they were young.

Why was Fourth Brother so angry now?
