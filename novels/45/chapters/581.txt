Chapter 582: Good Boy!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Gu Qi really liked Qiao Nian. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have eaten so much obediently.

If Gu Qi had been with Qiao Nian since he was born, would Gu Qi not have missed his biological mother and treat Qiao Nian as his own mother instead?

Would Gu Qi’s personality be much better than it was now? Would he also be happier?

Then would he no longer be like this?

Gu Zhou’s eyes darkened, his gaze deepening.

Qiao Nian waited for Gu Qi to finish his porridge. Smiling, she asked, “Do you want more?”

“I’m full.” Gu Qi stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian, his eyes filled with stars.

Qiao Nian placed the bowl on the bedside table and looked at Gu Qi dotingly. She gently patted Gu Qi’s head and praised, “Little Qi is so obedient today!”

There was a smile in Gu Qi’s eyes.

Qiao Nian covered Gu Qi with the blanket and lowered her head to kiss his forehead. “Be good, sleep some more. Good night!”

Gu Qi’s grape-sized eyes widened involuntarily. The spot on his forehead where Qiao Nian had kissed him was burning hot. The heat traveled from his forehead to every part of his body.

His heart began to race.

Was this how having a Mommy felt?

Seeing the smile on Qiao Nian’s face, Gu Qi felt a strange feeling in his heart. If only Auntie was Mommy. Then, he could always be with Mommy.

However, Auntie was not Mommy.

Gu Qi hurriedly hid the loneliness in his heart. Although Mommy wasn’t around, Auntie still treated him very well.

He had to stay at home obediently. Only then would his father not let anyone else take care of him.

Qiao Nian picked up the bowl on the bedside table and left with Gu Zhou.

When Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou came out of the ward, she couldn’t help but yawn. She said to Gu Zhou, “I’ll sleep in the guest room. You…”

Before Qiao Nian could finish speaking, Gu Zhou interrupted her. “Mrs. Gu, what are you saying?”

Mrs. Gu?

Every time Gu Zhou mentioned this form of address, he would always want to remind her of something.

Had she forgotten something?

She didn’t think so. Taking care of Gu Qi was the most important thing now.

Just as Qiao Nian was feeling puzzled, she heard Gu Zhou say, “Mrs. Gu, aren’t you going to help me change my dressing?”

Change the dressing!

Oh my!

She had forgotten about this.

She planned to help Gu Zhou change his dressing, but when she heard from Chen Qing that Gu Qi was sick, she left Gu Zhou behind and went to look for him.

She had been so busy taking care of Gu Qi that she had completely forgotten about treating Gu Zhou’s illness.

With an apologetic smile on her face, Qiao Nian said, “I’m sorry, there’s too much going on. I’ll go to the pharmacy room to get the medicine box. Wait for me in the guest room next door.”

With that, Qiao Nian ran downstairs.

Gu Zhou watched as Qiao Nian left. He recalled how smug Gu Qi had been because Qiao Nian had hugged him.

He really wanted to tell Gu Qi that his aunt was still very good at taking care of him. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

It was better to keep such childish words to himself.

Gu Zhou walked towards his bedroom.

When Qiao Nian rushed over from the medicinal room with the medicine box, she pushed open the door and saw Gu Zhou lying on the bed.

Qiao Nian walked over to him and called out softly, “Gu Zhou.”

However, Gu Zhou did not react. His breathing was long and even.

It seemed that he was really exhausted today. He had fallen asleep so quickly.

Qiao Nian put the medicine box aside naturally and reached out to unbutton Gu Zhou’s shirt.

Although this was not the first time she had helped Gu Zhou take off his clothes, her heart was beating exceptionally fast for some reason.

Carefully, she removed one of his sleeves.

The gauze on Gu Zhou’s back was already stained red with blood. She carefully removed the gauze and realized that the wound had scabbed over, but some of the scabs were still stuck to the gauze.
