1420 Meet Who?

Seeing Qiao Nian take a deep breath, Gu Zhou quickly walked to her side and asked worriedly, “What’s wrong? Are you airsick?”

Qiao Nian put her phone into her bag and smiled at Gu Zhou. She shook her head gently. “I’m fine. Where did you go just now?”

“I answered the phone outside.” Gu Zhou frowned slightly, his expression a little serious. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Seeing Gu Zhou like this, Qiao Nian asked worriedly, “Did something happen?”

“No.” Gu Zhou pursed his lips and said sternly, “Nian Nian, you’re going out with me tonight.”

“Okay.” Qiao Nian nodded. She looked at Gu Zhou’s pale face. “Who are you planning to take me to see?”

Actually, this matter was very easy to guess. Gu Zhou had just received a call. It was probably an invitation to the banquet.

“My father.”

Qiao Nian was stunned.

She looked at Gu Zhou’s serious expression. Photos of Gu Ting taking wedding photos appeared in her mind. Gu Ting’s serious expression made him look difficult to get along with.

She recalled the first time she had seen his mother. At that time, Bai Hui’s hostility towards her was especially deep.

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian’s expression changed slightly.

Seeing Qiao Nian’s serious expression, Gu Zhou reached out and held her hand. He said softly, “He knew as soon as we arrived in Europe. He called and invited us to dinner. He specially suggested bringing you along.”

Gu Zhou paused for a moment, his gaze falling on Qiao Nian’s face. With a serious expression, he said, “If you don’t want to see him, I’ll go myself. However, I’m very worried about your safety. Can you stay at home?”

Qiao Nian looked into Gu Zhou’s obsidian eyes. She knew that Gu Zhou was telling her this very seriously, and that he had been considering her feelings.

Her lips curved up slightly as she said softly, “I want to go with you. No matter what, he’s still your father and my father-in-law. We have to meet eventually.”

Qiao Nian wrapped her arms around Gu Zhou’s neck, her beautiful fox-like eyes filled with cunning. “Most importantly, I believe you. You definitely won’t let me suffer, right?”

Gu Zhou smiled and planted a kiss on Qiao Nian’s forehead. Only then did he stand up straight and nod in agreement.

…

An City.

Song Yu had just finished filming the last scene of the day. After thanking everyone, she asked her assistant to bring her back to the temporary hotel.

The moment she entered the room, she lay lazily on the sofa and closed her eyes to rest.

Just as Song Yu was about to fall asleep, there was a knock on the door. Exhausted, she opened her eyes. She had already instructed her assistant not to disturb her. It seemed that there must be something very important she needed to do.

With this thought in mind, Song Yu walked towards the door tiredly. The moment she opened the door, she saw Auntie Cao standing at the door with a lunch box and a smile.

Song Yu’s expression froze for a moment, then she smiled lightly and said, “Auntie Cao, you’re here. Come in.”

Song Yu invited Auntie Cao into the room.

Auntie Cao calmly walked to the coffee table and placed the thermos box in her hand on it. She smiled and said, “Sixth Miss, I know that you’ve been working hard filming recently, so I specially brought you your favorite food.”

With that, Auntie Cao smiled and opened the lunch box. She looked at Song Yu gently and said, “Sixth Miss, you can eat after washing your hands.”

“Thank you, Auntie Cao.” Song Yu was originally so tired that she didn’t want to eat, but when she smelled the fragrance of the food Auntie Cao had brought, she went to the bathroom to wash her hands before walking out. “I can tell from the smell that Auntie Cao personally cooked it.”

Auntie Cao smiled and handed the chopsticks to Song Yu. She rambled on about how Uncle Zhao had been poisoned by a hypnotic worm to harm Lu Qi and how Eldest Young Master had brought Matriarch Gu and the three children to the Lu family.

Song Yu ate her meal slowly. She more or less knew a little about what had happened between Auntie Cao and Uncle Zhao, so she said, “Auntie Cao, don’t worry. If Uncle Zhao was really controlled by the Hypnotic worm and harmed Qi Qi, the family will definitely understand.”

When Auntie Cao heard Song Yu’s words, she sighed heavily and continued, “Although that’s the case, I keep feeling that Matriarch might attack Old Zhao.”
