993 Good People Are Destined To Meet

Qiao Nian’s eyes darkened slightly. Her gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face, and she recalled how she had been schemed against that night. She said, “You all know what happened next. I was schemed against by Qiao Xin. Later on, because I was pregnant, the blame fell on my brother. However, my brother never found Grandpa.”

At this point, Qiao Nian suddenly thought of something and asked, “If your brother really invited my grandfather over, they must have fulfilled some conditions. Otherwise, my grandfather wouldn’t have made an exception to treat you. If this is the case, this means that they encountered a problem midway. Your brother was in a car accident, and my grandfather’s whereabouts are still unknown.”

The next day, Gu Zhou found out about Gu Yue’s car accident. When he heard Qiao Nian’s question, he recalled the situation.

After he regained consciousness, he received a call from the police. When he arrived at the scene of the car accident, the police had already taken care of everything and told him directly that his brother had been in a car accident and his whereabouts were unknown.

“I’ve never been able to believe the conclusions the police came to.”

“Yes, if it was really a car accident, he should have been in the car. The car shouldn’t be the only thing left behind. Either Gu Yue left on his own, or he was already incapacitated and taken away.” Lu Jiang pursed his lips tightly. For some reason, he felt that there was a huge net trapping them.

When Gu Zhou heard Lu Jiang’s words, his expression froze.

If Gu Yue was taken away, things would not be simple. His frown deepened, and his breathing gradually quickened.

Qiao Nian knew that Gu Zhou was worried about Gu Yue. She hurriedly said, “Don’t worry. When we were in MY, Eldest Senior Brother was still protecting you. This means that Brother is fine. Perhaps he can’t meet you because of other matters, nor can he go home. That’s why he didn’t come out to meet you!”

The expression on Gu Zhou’s face improved. He smiled and said, “I hope so.”

Although Qiao Nian was comforting Gu Zhou, she still felt very uneasy.

If her grandfather was really with Gu Yue that night, was her grandfather also kidnapped?

Otherwise, why couldn’t she and Qin Chuan find any traces of her grandfather?

What Qiao Nian was most afraid of was whether her grandfather had already left.

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian’s heart ached. She hurriedly threw the bad thoughts to the back of her mind.

Grandpa must have turned misfortune into blessings. He would be fine.

However, after everyone’s conversation today, Qiao Nian knew how to find her grandfather.

She had to tell Qin Chuan about these things.

The atmosphere in the living room was so heavy that it was suffocating.

Lu Qi glanced at everyone and seemed to have thought of something. She smiled and asked, “By the way, where are the children? I’m the aunt of the two children!”

“They’re upstairs now.”

At the mention of the children, Qiao Nian turned to look at Gu Zhou and asked seriously, “How did you find Xiao Qi back then?”

“At that time, someone called me and said that my child had been born.” Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian’s curious gaze and said, “That was a virtual number. I checked and found out that the owner of the phone number had died three months ago.”

Qiao Nian nodded and asked, “Then?”

“At that time, the woman had already died in childbirth. There was a child beside her. At that time, the child didn’t say a word. I thought that the child was gone too, but I didn’t expect Chen Qing to turn him around and pat his back. The child cried out. Later on, I brought the child home and did a paternity test, proving that the child was indeed mine!”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, her expression changed slightly. If Chen Qing hadn’t picked up the child and patted his back, the child might really have stopped breathing.

Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief and continued, “So, at that time, you always thought that Wang Lin was the mother of the child?”

“Yes, but…” Gu Zhou paused for a moment and continued, “She doesn’t have a pendant on her, so I was not 100% sure.”

Qiao Nian roughly understood Gu Zhou’s thoughts at that time. At that time, a child was lying beside a woman in childbirth. Anyone would think that woman was the mother of the child.
