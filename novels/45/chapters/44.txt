Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Alright.” Zheng Xiang gave Zheng He a look and said with a smile, “Brother, you have good taste. This chick is hot!”

Zheng He grinned foolishly. He liked beauties. The prettier they were, the better. If he didn’t think that this woman was good-looking, why would he have chosen her?

Zheng Xiang’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. He said threateningly, “Little girl, as long as you apologize to my brother and serve him well, this matter will be settled. I’m a magnanimous person, and I won’t hold it against you!”

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but laugh. It was as if she had heard the funniest joke in the world. Slowly, she spat out four syllables. “Impossible!”

Qiao Nian’s reply stunned Zheng Xiang.

It had been a long time since he had met such a fascinating chick.

Cracking his knuckles, Zheng Xiang looked at Qiao Nian coldly. “Little girl, your hair may be long, but you’re clearly a short-sighted fool. I, Zheng Xiang, draw blood whenever I attack. Don’t blame me for being vicious!”

Zheng Xiang chose to first launch a verbal attack because he didn’t want to strike a woman, especially a beautiful lady like Qiao Nian.

After all, he had to treat the fairer sex with gentleness!

However, when Zheng Xiang saw the disdain on the woman’s face, he could not help but frown. He felt that his dignity had been compromised. He said threateningly, “I’ve given you an easy way out. Since you’ve chosen not to take it, I’ll make sure you learn your lesson!”

If he didn’t beat this woman up till she was ruined, his name wouldn’t be Zheng Xiang! Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Zheng Xiang flexed his wrist, and the muscles on his arm bulged, bursting out of his suit jacket!

The people around them turned pale with fear and looked at Qiao Nian sympathetically.

“Oh my god, Zheng Xiang is going to hit her. This young lady is in trouble!”

“Isn’t that so? This young lady is too much. Couldn’t she just take the easy way out?”

“Quick, let’s leave. Quick! Remember, we can’t ever provoke Zheng He and the Zheng family again. For the sake of our pitiful lives!”

…

At this moment, Qiao Nian stood up elegantly and looked at Zheng Xiang, her gaze steady and calm. “There’s no need to show mercy!”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, the onlookers were all astonished.

Zheng Xiang was stunned for a moment. He gave a wild laugh. “Interesting, very interesting. This is the first time I’ve seen a woman who wants to die!”

Qiao Nian couldn’t be bothered to argue with Zheng Xiang. She narrowed her eyes and looked at him coldly, silver needles in hand.

Zheng Xiang was stupefied, his gaze falling on the silver needles in Qiao Nian’s hand. He mocked, “You’re indeed a female. All you know how to do is fight with embroidery needles. Here’s some advice: you should just have scrammed home earlier today and focused on sewing clothes. Don’t embarrass yourself outside!”

Qiao Nian didn’t say anything. Instead, she flicked her wrist just a little. As Zheng Xiang rushed towards her, the six silver needles in her hand flew towards Zheng Xiang like beams of cold light, all of them piercing into Zheng Xiang’s body.

Zheng Xiang maintained his offensive stance, but his body had fallen out of his control. He had no idea what was happening.

“What did you do to me!” Zheng Xiang glared at Qiao Nian, his eyes filled with rage and resentment. He said in exasperation, “What’s so good about playing petty tricks? Let go of me if you dare. Let’s have a fair fight!”

“Aren’t we fighting fairly?” Qiao Nian walked in a circle around Zheng Xiang, a trace of a smile in the corners of her eyes.

“You’re using a dirty trick!” Zheng Xiang absolutely refused to admit that he was weaker than her.

He believed that as long as Qiao Nian let go of him, he would definitely beat her to the ground.

Qiao Nian walked up to Zheng Xiang. Her eyes were cold as she poked Zheng Xiang’s chest with her index finger. Zheng Xiang fell backwards, toppling towards the ground uncontrollably.

The people who had arrived with Zheng Xiang hurried to catch him.

Zheng Xiang glanced at the people around him and said angrily, “None of you have any sense at all. Hurry up and remove the silver needles from my body! What are you thinking? Do you want to leave them in for the new year?”
