1308 Eldest Senior Brother?

Chen Qing could not withstand the strength of the three of them alone. He hid to the side in a sorry state and allowed the bed to be kicked in by the three of them. The bed slammed into the wall facing the ward door, producing a violent sound.

The three of them rushed in.

The ward was very dark. Qiao Nian could vaguely see that the three of them were wearing masks. She was stunned on the spot.

They had the same mask, the same clothes, and they were all about the same height. She couldn’t tell which one was Eldest Senior Brother.

At this moment, the lights in the room instantly lit up. Qiao Nian felt that the light was a little blinding. She raised her hand to cover her eyes. After a while, she opened her eyes.

After the ghost masked man on the left recovered, he picked up his pistol and fired at Gu Zhou, who was lying on the bed.

Chen Qing quickly rushed over and kicked the ghost masked man’s hand. The ghost masked man’s hand tilted and the bullet hit the ceiling.

Qiao Nian gasped, her heart beating faster and faster. She gripped the gun in her hand tightly and aimed at the three ghost masked men in front of her.

She didn’t know which ghost masked man was Chang Feng, so she could only aim at the people in front of her. She didn’t dare to shoot rashly, afraid that she would accidentally injure Eldest Senior Brother.

Chen Qing’s skills were not bad, and he quickly gained the upper hand. Seeing that their companions could not defeat Chen Qing, the other two ghost masked men rushed forward, turning into a one-on-three situation.

Chen Qing was no match for them and was sent flying by one of the ghost masked men.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on the neck of the ghost masked man who had kicked Chen Qing. He was wearing a pocket watch that her grandfather had given to Eldest Senior Brother. Just as she was about to shoot the other two, she saw Chen Qing preparing to shoot. Her expression changed. Before she could think, she blurted out, “Don’t shoot!” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Qiao Nian’s voice was very loud. Chen Qing, who was about to fire, froze for a moment. He tilted his hand slightly, and the bullet brushed past the ghost masked man’s arm and hit the wall.

The ghost masked man looked at Qiao Nian in confusion, then at Chen Qing. For a moment, he didn’t know what had happened.

Was this woman saving him?

When he realized this, the ghost masked man stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian. Could it be that she knew him?

Hearing Qiao Nian’s voice and seeing Dao Wen looking at her, Ba Song’s eyes instantly turned cold. He pulled Chang Feng to the other side.

When Ba Song went to the bathroom previously, he realized that Dao Wen had secretly sent a text to someone. Not only that, but after Dao Wen sent the text, he had also deleted it.

When Dao Wen saw him, he was so frightened that his face turned pale. He even hid his phone behind his back. He frowned. Was Dao Wen really in cahoots with Qiao Nian?

Ba Song gritted his teeth and looked at Dao Wen

If Dao Wen was really in a relationship with Qiao Nian, he would definitely betray his brothers for Qiao Nian.

Ba Song panted heavily. He yearned to shoot Dao Wen dead.

Seeing that Ba Song was staring at Dao Wen, a glint flashed in Chang Feng’s eyes. He pulled Ba Song back and shielded him.

Ba Song noticed Chang Feng’s actions. He took out his pistol and fired at Dao Wen!

He had to get rid of the traitor!

Seeing that a ghost masked man was about to kill Eldest Senior Brother, Qiao Nian hurriedly threw the glass cup on the table over.

Bang—

Ba Song’s bullet missed. The glass shattered into countless pieces and fell to the ground.

Qiao Nian took a step forward and looked at Dao Wen nervously. “Brother, how are you? Are you injured?”

Dao Wen was still in a daze. He didn’t understand why this unfamiliar woman wanted to save him. She was still so concerned about him. Could it be that this woman had a crush on him?

Ba Song looked at Qiao Nian sharply. That woman looked worried and didn’t seem to be lying at all. This meant that Dao Wen and Qiao Nian were really having an affair.

He was a straightforward person. He couldn’t stand betrayal.

Ba Song shouted in exasperation, “Traitor, traitor, die!”

As Ba Song spoke, he fired at Dao Wen again.

Qiao Nian took out her gun and was about to shoot at Ba Song.

Two gunshots rang out in the room.

Ba Song also noticed Qiao Nian’s actions. He immediately dodged. As he had to dodge Qiao Nian’s bullet, his bullet didn’t hit Dao Wen.
