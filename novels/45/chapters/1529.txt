The man narrowed his eyes slightly. Annie would definitely ask him to do something. He was the president’s guard. He could not be tempted by Annie.

Moreover, Annie was like a beautiful snake. Most people wouldn’t dare to touch her.

With this thought in mind, the man pushed Annie away without hesitation and said seriously, “Stay away from me. I won’t be fooled!”

With that, the man turned around and walked out without giving Annie a chance to speak.

Annie leaned against the wall weakly. She smiled at the departing man and said gently, “I hope you’ll be the one to bring me food tonight.”

The man’s hand was on the doorknob. He turned back to look at Annie and saw her blowing him a kiss. He looked away uncomfortably, opened the door, and went out angrily. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Seeing the man leave, Annie sneered, her eyes filled with cold killing intent. She casually played with the chain in her hand, her mind racing.

After Qiao Nian arrived at the palace, she began to take Madam President’s pulse.

After taking Madam President’s pulse, Qiao Nian looked at her gently and asked, “How do you feel?”

“I’m much better,” Madam President said softly.

The President also realized that Madam President was in good spirits yesterday and looked much better. She looked healthy. He couldn’t help but ask, “Miss Qiao, what medicine did you give my Madam yesterday? She’s much better than before.”

Moreover, Qiao Nian’s medicine emitted a fragrance. If one didn’t know better, they would think that it was a casual drink.

Qiao Nian spread out the paper and picked up a pen at the side. Smiling, she said, “These are the herbs I specially cultivated in the past. Later on, I realized that Madam could use them, so I got someone to send them over.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “But just drinking tonic won’t cure the root cause. I need to help Madam detoxify the poison first, then take out the Hypnotic worm in her body.”

As Qiao Nian spoke, she quickly wrote down the prescription on the paper.

After she finished writing, she looked at the president and said, “Mr. President, have you sorted out Madam’s medical cases?”

The European President knew in his heart that that herb was definitely not simple. If it was really simple, there would definitely be a lot of it on the market.

Previously, when he treated Madam, he had found many doctors and tried many medicines, but none of them were as effective as Qiao Nian’s.

A medicine that had immediate effects was definitely not simple.

However, Qiao Nian could take it out directly.

A complicated look flashed in the President’s eyes as he looked at Qiao Nian. He nodded slightly and said, “It’s almost done. I’ll give it to you when it’s ready.”

Qiao Nian smiled and said, “Okay.”

Qiao Nian handed the list of herbs to a servant and said, “Prepare these herbs first.”

The servant took Qiao Nian’s medicine list and replied, “Yes, ma’am.” He turned around to prepare the medicine.

Qiao Nian looked at Madam President and said gently, “Madam, just take off your clothes and lie on the bed with your back exposed.”

Madam President smiled shyly and nodded, walking towards the bed.

Qiao Nian was about to take out the silver needles when she recalled that Madam President might be afraid of needles. She said gently, “Madam, you can close your eyes first. That way, you won’t be afraid.”

“Okay,” Madam President replied and closed her eyes.

Qiao Nian took out a silver needle and began to perform acupuncture on Madam President. Worried that Madam President would be unwilling to let her insert the needles, she inserted a needle into Madam President’s sleeping acupoint in advance. Madam President fell asleep peacefully.

The president sat at the side and watched Qiao Nian’s technique. Although he didn’t understand what acupuncture points Qiao Nian had inserted the needles in, Qiao Nian’s smooth technique seemed to have been done a million times.

Qiao Nian inserted the last silver needle before sitting on a stool to rest. She glanced at the time and prepared to pull out the needles later.

After a while, the President saw that Madam President had already fallen asleep. He looked at Qiao Nian and said softly, “Miss Qiao, I’ll go see how the preparation of the cases is going.”

“Okay.” Qiao Nian smiled and watched as the president left.

Soon, the door to the room closed. Qiao Nian glanced at the time and began to remove the silver needles from Madam President’s body.

The insertion of the needles was slower, but the speed at which they were pulled out was much faster.

Qiao Nian pulled out the last silver needle. Madam President, who had already fallen asleep, woke up.
