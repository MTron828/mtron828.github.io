Qiao Nian smiled and shook her head. “I’m not cold.”

Her gaze inadvertently fell on the table beside her. There was red wine and desserts on the table. It seemed that Gu Zhou had specially gotten someone to prepare them.

“What do you want to say to me?” Qiao Nian went straight to the point. If Gu Qi wasn’t sick, she would be very willing to stay here and admire the beautiful scenery of An City with Gu Zhou. However, she was still very worried about Gu Qi.

“This is a strawberry pastry I got someone to specially make. It should be your favorite.” Gu Zhou didn’t answer Qiao Nian immediately. His gaze fell on the small table.

Qiao Nian picked up a piece of cake. It melted in her mouth. The soft and delicate texture was her favorite flavor. Moreover, she didn’t find the cake greasy after eating it.

“Delicious. Has the family changed chefs?” Qiao Nian smiled at Gu Zhou.

“It’s from somewhere else,” Gu Zhou said, his gaze lingering on Qiao Nian’s face. “You suggested hiding your identity today. Have you been thinking about getting a divorce?”

Qiao Nian was drinking red wine with this pastry. The taste was amazing.

She ate happily, but she had never expected Gu Zhou to bring up the past.

“How is that possible?” Qiao Nian mocked Gu Zhou silently, but she didn’t show it on her face. She looked at Gu Zhou with a smile. “It’s so good to be Mrs. Gu. Many people would do anything to be Mrs. Gu.”

“To you, Gu Qi is just a child you’ve just met not long ago. For his sake, you want me to bring the entire Gu family to lie?” Gu Zhou raised his eyebrows, staring unblinkingly at Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian had never expected Gu Zhou to be so gentle when she first arrived. Now, he was questioning her.

He was truly an unpredictable man!

Of course, Qiao Nian didn’t dare to reveal her true thoughts. Her lips curved up slightly as she said gently, “Gu Qi is so obedient. I like him very much too. It’s only right for me to take care of his feelings. Moreover, logically speaking, he should call me Godmother.”

Gu Zhou didn’t speak. His gaze remained fixed on Qiao Nian, as if he wanted to see something different in her eyes.

Qiao Nian smiled at Gu Zhou and leaned closer to him. “Aren’t you very concerned about him too? I’m doing this for your sake.”

Gu Zhou’s slender fingers gripped the wine glass tightly. He drained it in one gulp, stood up, and walked in.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion, not understanding what she had said wrong. She hurriedly stood up and rushed towards Gu Zhou’s back. “What are you doing?”

“Going down the mountain.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Qiao Nian hurriedly jogged after Gu Zhou. However, Gu Zhou was walking a little too fast, so she could only jog. “Walk slower.”

She really didn’t understand what Gu Zhou was up to again.

Qiao Nian followed Gu Zhou into the long corridor of the villa. The corridor was dark, and she couldn’t see Gu Zhou. She could only hear Gu Zhou’s footsteps getting further and further away.

Darkness enveloped and suffocated her.

Qiao Nian felt a chill run down her spine. She hurriedly wrapped her clothes around herself, the panic in her heart gradually growing.

She had wanted to take out her phone to turn on the lights, but when she thought about how she had left her phone in Gu Qi’s room, she knew that something was wrong.

“Gu Zhou, can you wait for me?” Qiao Nian shouted, feeling a little anxious.

“Why are you shouting? I can hear you!”

Gu Zhou’s voice came from ahead. Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. It seemed that he hadn’t gone far.

At this moment, a hand grabbed hers.

“Ah, let go of me! Don’t touch me!” Qiao Nian couldn’t help but scream.

The memories of that night five years ago surged like a rising tide.

She was locked in a dark room. She was about to leave when a hand grabbed her wrist and held her by force. The hand tightened, and she fell back onto the bed.
