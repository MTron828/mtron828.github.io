When Lu Zhu heard Auntie Cao’s words, he frowned!

Auntie Cao looked at Qiao Nian unhappily and said sternly, “Fifth Miss, I know that you came back from outside. In that case, I don’t think you know the rules of the Lu family. In the future, I’ll slowly teach you the rules of the Lu family. You won’t be able to go around like before. I hope you can throw away all your bad habits and not bring them home!”

Before Qiao Nian could speak, Lu Zhu couldn’t stand it anymore. His eyes were cold, and his voice was cold. “Do you still know that this is the Lu family?”

Auntie Cao was shocked by Lu Zhu’s voice. This was the first time she had heard Lu Zhu use such a cold voice. Lu Zhu’s usual voice gave off a calm feeling. She had a bad feeling!

Auntie Cao glanced at the other young masters. All of them were looking at her coldly, as if she was their enemy!

The Young Masters had never looked at her like this in the past!

Auntie Cao frowned and said unhappily, “It’s precisely because I know that this is the Lu family that I hope that Fifth Miss can integrate into the Lu family as soon as possible. No matter what, as long as she’s a member of the Lu family, you have to follow the rules!”

Qiao Nian stood rooted to the ground coldly. Her beautiful fox-like eyes narrowed slightly, her expression indifferent! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Although everyone was in the ancestral hall, no one made any noise!

However, when Auntie Cao came over, she looked at everyone unhappily, as if everyone had made a huge mistake. It was as if she was the one who had lured her brothers and sisters into making a mistake!

Qiao Nian narrowed her eyes slightly. Back then, when she reunited with Grandma, Auntie Cao had already interfered. Now, Auntie Cao was deliberately targeting her!

What exactly did Auntie Cao mean?

Qiao Nian recalled Jiang Cheng’s diary. Jiang Cheng had once mentioned that the kidnappers’ companion, who had kidnapped her more than twenty years ago, had called the Lu family. Could that person be Auntie Cao?

Qiao Nian thought about it carefully. If Auntie Cao treated her brothers and sisters very well, it meant that she really cared about the children of the Lu family. However, she would also consider Auntie Cao a suspect.

Song Yu had been good at reading someone’s body language since she was young. When she realized that everyone didn’t look well, she hurriedly walked to Auntie Cao’s side and said, “Auntie Cao, you’ve misunderstood. Everyone follows the rules very well, including Sister. No one here doesn’t follow the rules!”

Auntie Cao did not take Song Yu’s words to heart at all. She questioned coldly, “Before Fifth Miss returned, no one dared to talk and laugh in the ancestral hall!”

Song Yu tugged at Auntie Cao’s sleeve. Seeing that Auntie Cao had taken a look, she hurriedly shook her head and said, “Auntie Cao, stop!”

“Shut up, Auntie Cao. I advise you to manage your words and actions well. You have no right to speak here!” Lu Zhu said coldly, his eyes very cold.

Auntie Cao noticed Lu Zhu’s gaze and swallowed nervously. Among these young masters, she was most afraid of Eldest Young Master. Eldest Young Master looked gentle, but his methods were very ruthless!

Auntie Cao had stayed in the Lu family for more than thirty years. In the past, the young masters would give her some face. Now, these young masters were all disobeying her for Fifth Miss.

Auntie Cao took a deep breath. The young masters and young ladies were still too young and did not know anything. She looked at Lu Zhu helplessly and explained earnestly, “Eldest Young Master, my mission is to look after the Young Masters and young ladies. When you were young, no matter what mistakes you made, I would point them out. As long as you corrected yourselves, that would be fine. Why doesn’t it work now that it’s Fifth Miss’s turn?”

She paused for a moment and continued, “The Lu family is a wealthy family. Every one of you represents the Lu family. If everyone finds out that the Lu family has a young lady who doesn’t know the rules, the Lu family will be criticized in the future. Master and Madam will also be criticized! I just want her to”

When Lu Jiang heard Auntie Cao’s words, his eyes narrowed. His voice was as cold as ice as he interrupted Auntie Cao. “Enough!”

Auntie Cao was slightly stunned. She frowned and looked at Lu Jiang in disbelief. “Fourth Young Master, how could you”
