1070 Got a Rich Man

Shen Hao was brazen enough to insist that Qiao Nian had seduced him.

In a rage, Xu Qiu picked up a broom at the side and was about to beat Qiao Nian to death. She had long disliked Qiao Nian. She had raised someone in the family for nothing. She had long been dissatisfied!

Shen Hao’s son, Shen Cai, had just returned. When he heard Xu Qiu’s tearful words, he was about to teach Qiao Nian a lesson.

At this moment, Qin Chuan and Eldest Senior Brother walked in.

!!

The Qin family and the Shen family were next to each other. When Qin Chuan heard the commotion, he rushed over.

Qin Chuan and Eldest Senior Brother protected her from the Shen family. Although she was protected from being beaten and scolded, Shen Cai became more and more shameless. He secretly wanted to touch her.

The father and son of the Shen family were simply birds of a feather. They were lazy and lecherous!

Although they were both from the countryside, Qiao Nian really couldn’t tell that they were simple-minded. The two of them were simply scum among humans!

When Shen Hao saw Qiao Nian, his eyes lit up. In the past, when he was in the Shen family, he had always thought that Qiao Nian was good-looking. He didn’t expect her to grow up and look even better now. She was like a vixen and seductive like a siren.

“Oh my, my good niece, you’re finally back. This car isn’t bad. Looks like you’ve found yourself a rich man!” Shen Hao looked at Qiao Nian lecherously, regretting not taking her in back then.

As long as Qiao Nian looked into Shen Hao’s eyes, she would know what he was thinking. Her stomach churned, and she yearned to kick him away!

Of course, Shen Hao didn’t know what Qiao Nian was thinking. His attention was all on Qiao Nian’s face.

Qiao Nian was good-looking. Even the female celebrities on television were probably not as good-looking as her.

She had a palm-sized face, bright eyes, white teeth, a tall nose, and cherry-like lips. Her skin was so fair that it glowed under the sunlight!

Shen Hao walked up to Qiao Nian and reached out to touch her face. He felt that Qiao Nian’s face must feel especially good, like a peeled egg!

In the past, he had seen many people write in books that girls’ faces were smooth and delicate, but his wife’s face was extremely rough. He had once thought that those were all lies!

But when he saw Qiao Nian, he realized how wrong he had been!

A beauty was a beauty!

Before Shen Hao’s hand could touch Qiao Nian’s face, Qiao Nian slapped it away!

Qiao Nian narrowed her eyes and said coldly, “Get lost!”

Then, Qiao Nian took out a tissue from her bag and wiped her hand that had just touched Shen Hao’s. She threw the tissue into the trash can!

Shen Hao’s mind was filled with Qiao Nian’s peerless beauty. He didn’t notice Qiao Nian’s disdainful gaze at all. He took a step forward and asked with a smile, “Nian Nian, no matter what, I’m the uncle who has raised you for so many years. How can you be so cold and heartless? I miss you every day!”

As Shen Hao spoke, he looked at Qiao Nian’s face in fascination. He reached out to touch Qiao Nian’s face again, but Qiao Nian dodged him.

Qiao Nian took a few steps back and distanced herself from Shen Hao. The cold aura she exuded made her look like a death god from hell. She looked at Shen Hao coldly and warned, “I advise you not to have a death wish!”

“Nian Nian, why are you still so angry? Those Young brats aren’t by your side. No one is helping you now!” The more Shen Hao thought about it, the more excited he became. He rubbed his hands in front of him. “I heard that you’ve even hooked up with a rich man. You’ve become rich. When are you going to give Uncle some money?”

As Shen Hao spoke, he walked towards Qiao Nian like he was possessed!

“Qiao Nian, you b*tch. Other than seducing men, what else do you know? You’re so shameless in broad daylight. You even want to seduce your uncle! If you want to seduce men so badly, you might as well become a prostitute!”

A sharp voice filled with anger came from afar. That voice was a little ear-piercing!

At this moment, a wide and fat woman quickly walked forward and pulled Shen Hao behind her! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

This woman was none other than Shen Hao’s wife, Xu Qiu!

Xu Qiu weighed about 200 kilograms. Standing in front of Qiao Nian, she looked like a huge creature.

The more Xu Qiu looked at Qiao Nian, the more she disliked her. Qiao Nian looked like a vixen siren. Her eyes were seducing men everywhere!

If she wasn’t careful, Qiao Nian would seduce her man!

The last person she wanted to see in her life was Qiao Nian. This young lady didn’t know any self-respect at all!

Xu Qiu pointed at Qiao Nian’s face and said angrily, “I finally understand. You’re such a vixen. You’re so shameless. No wonder your mother wasn’t willing to raise you back then. She was afraid that you would seduce people everywhere. Perhaps you might even seduce your father. You’re simply shameless…”
