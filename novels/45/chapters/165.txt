Chapter 166 Change

Although this gown that belonged to Jiang Yue was different from the black diamond gown, it gave off a gentle aura of purity.

The gown was a light shade of purple, and the embroidery at the neckline and hip revealed a serene beauty.

When Jiang Yue saw this gown, her eyes lit up. Tears began falling uncontrollably.

Grandma was right. This gown was made for her. Be it in terms of design or embroidery, it was everything she loved. Seeing that Jiang Yue was still standing there, Matriarch Gu said angrily, “Look at you. This gown isn’t suitable for you. The threads are about to snap, yet you’re still wearing it. What do you look like? Hurry up and take it

off!”

When Qiao Nian heard Matriarch Gu’s words, her gaze fell on Jiang Yue’s waist. She could already see the threads unraveling there.

She couldn’t help but frown. If Grandma wasn’t here, she wouldn’t mind even if the gown split open while Jiang Yue was speaking on stage. Now, however, she was worried that if something happened to Jiang Yue, Grandma would be upset.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Jiang Yue’s face. She continued, “Why don’t you change out of your gown? That purple gown looks nicer. It suits you better.”

When Jiang Yue heard Qiao Nian’s words, disgust flashed in her eyes.

Although she liked the gown Grandma had prepared for her, she still preferred this gown with diamonds all over it.

She had yearned for such a gown for a long time.

Jiang Yue still couldn’t figure out why Grandma would give a gown she liked the best to Qiao Nian.

“Grandma, I’m sorry.” With tears in her eyes, Jiang Yue looked pathetically at Matriarch Gu. “Since I’ve already put on this gown, I won’t take it off again.”

Jiang Yue’s dignity wouldn’t allow her to change out of her gown right now.

Even if she had to take it off, she would only do so after her speech.

Matriarch Gu’s eyes widened in anger. She began panting heavily. All this time, Jiang Yue had always been an obedient and adorable child. This was the first time she had seen Jiang Yue willfully disobeying her.

At this moment, the host invited Jiang Yue onto the stage for a speech.

Jiang Yue looked at Matriarch Gu with a determined expression. She gave Matriarch Gu an elegant bow before walking towards the podium. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

At this point, there was no turning back.

Matriarch Gu was panting heavily with rage.

Qiao Nian hurriedly patted Matriarch Gu’s back and comforted her softly. “Grandma, don’t be angry.”

Matriarch Gu finally managed to catch her breath. She looked at Jiang Yue in disbelief and said in a disappointed voice, “What exactly is this girl thinking today? She used to be very obedient and sensible. How did she become like this?”

Qiao Nian did not speak. Instead, she looked at Jiang Yue, who was standing at the podium. Her eyes darkened. In life, every person was bound to have certain obsessions, or certain matters on which they were unwilling to compromise. She guessed that Jiang Yue’s would be insisting on only wearing gowns handmade by Matriarch Gu.

Seeing that Jiang Yue was being disobedient, Matriarch Gu said, “Nian Nian, don’t…”

“Grandma, I’m not angry. I was the first to wear this gown. In my heart, it already belongs to me. Moreover, you’ve already taken many photographs of me, haven’t you? I think it will still belong to me in the future.” Qiao Nian smiled and consoled Matriarch Gu.

When Matriarch Gu heard Qiao Nian’s words, she was overjoyed. She yearned to give Qiao Nian all the best things in the world. This was her darling girl.

“Ah!”

Jiang Yue’s scream suddenly rang out. Amplified by the microphone, it became so loud and piercing that everyone hurriedly covered their ears.

Everyone looked over and saw that Jiang Yue’s gown was no longer covering her appropriately. She was covering her chest with both hands, looking terrified.

This gown was simply too small for Jiang Yue. Her mind had been in a mess just now, and she had completely forgotten to suck in her stomach. The gown had burst open, and it was now hanging on her like a rag.
