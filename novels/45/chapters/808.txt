809 Diary

After her sowing discord this time, it was probably impossible for Su Xue to marry Qiao Shan!

This was human nature.

In layman’s terms, cheating either happened or not.

In Qiao Shan’s eyes, Su Xue loved having an affair.

If Qiao Shan hadn’t caught Su Xue cheating on him, even if she had told him that Su Xue had cheated on him, Qiao Shan wouldn’t have believed her.

Before Su Xue was discovered to have an affair, she was a virtuous and kind woman in Qiao Shan’s eyes.

If Qiao Shan had seen Su Xue having an affair with his own eyes, things would have been different.

Qiao Nian felt that it was very likely that Qiao Shan would investigate the one million yuan incident from twenty years ago. She hoped that Qiao Shan could find some new clues. That would save her the trouble of investigating.

Unknowingly, Qiao Nian had already walked to the room she had once stayed in. Qiao Xin had already turned this room into a cloakroom.

She had no status in the Qiao family.

Qiao Nian pushed open the door and looked at the room full of clothes and jewelry. A trace of coldness flashed in her eyes.

She glanced around the walk-in closet. When she used to live here, the walls of the room were tiled, and the floor was tiled for a bathroom.

This room was originally modified from a bathroom.

Now, the entire room had changed drastically. The floor was made of high-quality solid wood, and the four walls were filled with wardrobes. Through the transparent glass, one could vaguely see the clothes hanging inside.

Qiao Nian’s gaze finally landed on the ceiling above the cloakroom.

Although this room had changed a lot, its ceiling had not changed. It was still the same ceiling.

Worried that her diary would be discovered, she had hidden it in the ceiling of the cloakroom.

In the eyes of the Qiao family, she was only fit to sleep in the bathroom back then. She was not even treated as a servant.

Qiao Nian moved a stool over and stood on it. She opened the ceiling and took out a wooden box.

She had been worried that her notebook would be discovered, so she had put it in a box with a Luban lock.

If someone deliberately destroyed the Luban lock, it would crack and destroy the notebook inside.

It took a lot of patience to open this Luban lock.

There seemed to be only one Luban lock. If one looked closely, they would discover that it was made of nine Luban locks.

It would take a lot of time for ordinary people to open this Luban lock.

Qiao Nian placed the Luban lock in her bag and returned the ceiling to its original position. Only then did she walk downstairs.

The battle downstairs was still intense.

To be precise, Qiao Shan was dealing damage unilaterally.

It was obvious that Qiao Shan hated Su Xue to the core. He yearned to beat Su Xue to death. Every move he made was ruthless and merciless. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Perhaps it was because Qiao Shan and Su Xue had caused too much of a commotion, but all the servants of the Qiao family rushed over. They wanted to step forward to stop the fight, but they were afraid that Qiao Shan would vent his anger on them. One by one, they stood at the side and could only stop the fight.

Su Xue screamed in pain, refusing to admit that she had cheated on him. She continued to beg for mercy. “Hubby, things really aren’t what you think. I really didn’t let you down. You have to believe me. I can swear to God that I’ll do whatever you want me to do!”

“B*tch, how can you be so despicable? Do you think you’ll die without a man? I’ll beat you to death…” Qiao Shan hit Su Xue angrily, his words filled with conviction.

Su Xue’s face was bruised and swollen. She no longer looked as elegant as before. Instead, she looked disheveled.

Qiao Nian looked at the current Su Xue without a trace of sympathy. There was only coldness in her eyes. In her opinion, Su Xue had brought this upon herself.

At this moment, Qiao Xin returned from outside. When she saw Qiao Shan sparing no effort in beating Su Xue up, she hurriedly ran over and grabbed Qiao Shan’s hand. She cried, “Dad, stop! Stop hitting her! You’ll beat Mom to death!”

Qiao Xin hurriedly stepped forward and grabbed Qiao Shan’s arm. When she saw that Su Xue was covered in wounds, she was so anxious that tears were about to fall.

However, Qiao Shan’s mind was filled with Su Xue, who had cheated on him.

He couldn’t understand why Su Xue would keep a gigolo behind his back when he was so good to her and had his heart set on his family.
