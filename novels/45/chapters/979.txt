980 Escape

There were two despicable people in He Cheng’s mind.

A small figure reminded him that as long as he played Qiao Nian and Lu Qi, he would have three million yuan!

Another despicable person reminded him that Qiao Nian was the god of death. He had to leave quickly, or he would die miserably!

In the end, his fear of Qiao Nian prevailed. He could only flee.

He wasn’t a fool. He had just realized that Qiao Nian was decisive. She was definitely a martial artist. How could his lousy skills compare to a martial artist’s?

How strange. This woman could clearly resolve everything herself, but that night, she didn’t make a move. Instead, she let Fourth Master resolve everything.

Could it be that she had some special relationship with Fourth Master?

No, at that time, Fourth Master didn’t seem to be familiar with her.

He Cheng’s eyes darkened. It seemed that he had to ask Qiao Xin about this. Although he couldn’t get his way this time, he would definitely make Qiao Nian cry and beg him next time!

He had to regain his dignity on his own!

Seeing He Cheng leave dejectedly, Qiao Nian looked at Lu Qi, who was standing not far away in a daze. She quickly walked over and asked nervously, “Lu Qi, are you alright?” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Lu Qi came back to her senses. When she met Qiao Nian’s worried eyes, she was slightly stunned.

Qiao Nian’s gaze was the same as when her family had looked at her previously. There was worry and anxiety in her eyes.

At the thought of her family, Lu Qi’s eyes couldn’t help but turn red. She slowly lowered her gaze, her eyes a little sad.

Lu Qi’s voice was a little choked up. She shook her head and said, “Sister Qiao Nian, I’m fine!”

Qiao Nian’s heart ached when she saw Lu Qi’s frightened and aggrieved expression.

The Lu family had once lost a daughter. They would definitely pay special attention to Lu Qi’s safety.

Lu Qi must have been well protected by the Lu family, so she had never encountered such a thing.

Therefore, it was normal for Lu Qi to be unable to accept it for a moment.

However, in Qiao Nian’s opinion, Lu Qi had performed very well just now. She hadn’t revealed any flaws at all.

Fortunately, Lu Qi had performed so well just now that she did not anger He Cheng. If He Cheng took out the knife from his pocket, Lu Qi would definitely be injured.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian took Lu Qi’s hand and walked towards her car. She comforted her gently, “Alright, don’t be afraid. I’ve already chased the bad guy away. Let’s get in the car and go home!”

When Lu Qi heard Qiao Nian’s words, she nodded in disappointment. “Yes.”

Lu Qi got into the car, and Qiao Nian drove Lu Qi towards the Lu family home. She had come to look for Lu Qi to inquire about what gifts Lu Qi liked, but it wasn’t appropriate for her to ask now.

The car was very quiet. Lu Qi sat in the front passenger seat and looked out of the window with a disappointed expression, her eyes dim.

After a long while, Lu Qi recovered and said to Qiao Nian, “Sister Nian Nian, thank you so much for just now. If it weren’t for you, I wouldn’t know what to do.”

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Qi’s words, she smiled and comforted her. “There’s no need to be so polite between us. However, He Cheng is a person who won’t stop until he achieves his goal. This time, I’ve chased him away. Perhaps he’ll find an opportunity to get close to you. You have to be careful in the future. Bring more people with you.”

“He Cheng?” Lu Qi looked at Qiao Nian in confusion, not knowing who He Cheng was.

Qiao Nian said, “He’s the person who wanted to kidnap you just now. His name is He Cheng. We met once in the past.”

When Lu Qi heard Qiao Nian’s words, she nodded slightly and said, “I see. He even lied to me just now, saying that his name was Cheng He!”

“He definitely didn’t dare to use his real name, so he used a fake name to get close to you.” At this point, Qiao Nian asked in confusion, “By the way, what did he tell you?”

Lu Qi’s eyes darkened. She briefly explained what had happened before and finally said, “I think he’s a little shifty. I also thought of how my brother’s people all looked righteousness, and none of them were timid. I sensed that something was wrong back then, so I wanted to leave, but he was watching me very closely. Although there were many people by the roadside, I was afraid that he would attack me before I could ask for help.”

“You’ve done very well this time. Don’t anger him. Letting him lower his guard helped you escape.” Qiao Nian turned to look at Lu Qi and smiled. “How smart!”
