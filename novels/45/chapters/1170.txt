1171 Guilt

Shen An lowered his head and played with the Rubik’s Cube in his hand, as if he hadn’t heard Su Yan.

Thank you readers!

Su Yan wasn’t discouraged. She looked at Shen An with heartache and called out, “Teacher, I’m Su Yan.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

When Su Yan didn’t speak, Shen An was still very quiet. However, when he heard “Su Yan,” he was uneasy and suddenly became agitated.

“It’s so bright. I’m going to die from the sun!” As Chen An spoke, he threw down the Rubik’s cube in panic and hid in a corner where the sun couldn’t reach in a sorry state. He hugged his knees in fear and unease and squatted there.

Shen An buried his head in his knees. His body was still trembling, as if he was very afraid of the sunlight.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on the curtains. The curtains were originally white, but there seemed to be an additional layer of black cloth inside. It seemed that Shen An had asked for it himself.

Qiao Nian walked to the window and swiftly drew the curtains!

Shen An gradually raised his head from his knees, and his gaze fell on the Rubik’s Cube not far away. He immediately walked over, took the Rubik’s Cube, and ran back to the corner to squat. He began to play with the Rubik’s Cube again.

When Shen An couldn’t notice the sunlight, he fell silent.

Qiao Nian looked at Shen An and frowned slightly. There was a psychological manifestation of guilt. Some people would always be afraid of something when they had done something wrong.

Some people were timid. After doing something wrong, they began to be afraid of ghosts.

Shen An was a famous big boss in the forensics field. If he was a theologian, he definitely wouldn’t dare to be a forensic doctor.

Shen An should be an atheist, but he had now received a “guilty psychological manifestation”. This meant that he had once done something that made him feel guilty and uneasy.

Su Yan looked at Shen An with heartache. He was her teacher, and the person she respected the most in her life!

Shen An had once written a book that was filled with new methods of autopsy. It could accurately determine the true time of death of a corpse and conveniently helped the police to solve cases.

When Su Yan left An City, Shen An was still that elegant and gentlemanly elder.

In just a few years, his teacher had actually become like this.

“Su Yan?” Shen An stopped what he was doing and raised his head slightly. He narrowed his eyes, as if he wanted to see the person in front of him clearly.

“Teacher, I’m Su Yan.” Su Yan squatted in front of Shen An, her gaze level with his.

“Su Yan?” Shen An frowned slightly, staring unblinkingly at Su Yan’s face. Suddenly, his expression changed drastically and he shouted, “Su Yan, I’m sorry, I’m sorry!”

Su Yan was shocked by Shen An’s voice. She looked at him in surprise, not understanding what he meant at all.

As Shen An apologized, he spun the Rubik’s cube in his hand crazily.

From Shen An’s current reaction, he should know that something had happened to the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou stood at the side and said to the other members of the Lu family. They sent everyone out and closed the door.

The room instantly darkened, leaving only Shen An, Su Yan, Qiao Nian, and Gu Zhou.

“I’m sorry… I’m sorry…” Shen An apologized in a low voice. His body couldn’t help but tremble, and his voice was hoarse.

The room was very dark. Qiao Nian took out her cell phone. There was only a little light in the room.

After Shen An unlocked the Rubik’s Cube, it unfolded. There was a small USB drive in the Rubik’s Cube. “Su Yan, I’ll leave this to you. I’m sorry, I’m really sorry.”

Su Yan took the USB drive from Shen An and looked at him in surprise. Puzzled, she asked, “Teacher?”

“Save… save Sugar.” Shen An held Su Yan’s hand tightly, his voice trembling. “Sugar is alive. Su Family Village. Su Family Village. Go and find her!”

When Su Yan heard Shen An’s words, her pupils instantly dilated. She looked at Shen An in disbelief and grabbed his hand. She asked anxiously, “What Su family village? Teacher, what exactly is going on? Why is Sugar in the Su family village?”

“I don’t know, I don’t know. I don’t know anything.” Shen An seemed to be shocked. He immediately retracted his hand and hugged his knees with both hands, burying his head in them.
