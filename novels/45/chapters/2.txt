Chapter 3: The First Encounter!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian walked over to the little boy, squatted down and felt his pulse.

When the onlookers saw Qiao Nian checking up on the little boy, they couldn’t help but make comments.

“Young lady, you’d better get into the wedding car. It’s really inauspicious for you to encounter such a thing on your wedding day!”

“Yeah, this little boy is really unlucky. I wonder whose child he is!”

“If this child’s parents decide to extort money, we’ll be in big trouble!”

…

Qiao Nian could tell that there was nothing wrong with the little boy’s pulse. Seeing that his face was pale and that he was still covered in cold sweat, she had an idea.

Su Xue saw that Qiao Nian was refusing to leave. Thinking that Qiao Nian wanted to run away from the marriage, she immediately walked up to Qiao Nian and said in a low voice, “Hurry up and get in the wedding car. Let me tell you, don’t you dare try any tricks!”

“Get me a bowl of sugar solution!” Qiao Nian held her hand out towards Su Xue.

Su Xue glared daggers at Qiao Nian, then turned her head to signal the servant next to her.

Soon, the maid brought over the sugar solution. Qiao Nian made the little boy drink it, then got someone to call the ambulance. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Su Xue gritted her teeth in anger, but she had no choice but to call an ambulance. She even asked the servant to bring out a chair for the little boy to sit on. When she was done, she walked over to Qiao Nian.

“Stop playing tricks. Hurry and get into the Gu family’s car!” Su Xue was really worried that Qiao Nian would use this opportunity to escape. She didn’t want her darling daughter Qiao Xin to marry a short-lived wretch.

Qiao Nian gave Su Xue one last cold glance, before getting into the Gu family’s car.

The Gu family’s castle was in the forest nearby. Along the borders of the city, one could already see the castle’s tall spires reaching up towards the sky.

It was a spectacular sight to behold. There was even an appealing air of mystery surrounding the castle.

However, it was said that no one was willing to come to this place. Once they stepped into the Gu family’s territory, the Gu family’s bodyguards would convince them to leave.

In her wedding dress, Qiao Nian walked alone into the Gu residence. The Gu family servants were momentarily surprised to see her wearing that, but still politely brought her to the drawing room.

The Gu family’s drawing room was lavishly furnished, in a style that resembled European architecture. Sunlight filtered through the glass, bathing the entire living room in golden light.

“Miss Qiao, please wait for a moment. I’ll go get Second Young Master Gu!”

Qiao Nian nodded. After the servant left, she sat on the sofa and leaned back elegantly, her chin resting on her left hand.

Why would the Gu family want a marriage with the Qiao family?

Was it really to get rid of bad luck, as others had said?

Qiao Nian thought to herself. If Qiao Xin knew that she came to the Gu family in a wedding dress, but it turned out that the Gu family had no intention of holding a wedding, Qiao Xin might just burst into tears.

QIao Nian was the only daughter in the Qiao family who could remain calm and composed in any situation.

At this moment, Qiao Nian suddenly sensed something strange behind her. Instinctively, she moved aside, and almost immediately after, she glimpsed a blue creature flying past her.

It was a blue-green python. Although it was small, it was extremely fast.

The python flicked out its bright red tongue and stared coldly at Qiao Nian. Its body swayed continually, as if it was considering how it should attack and devour her.

In a flash, the python shot towards Qiao Nian like an arrow leaving its bow.

Qiao Nian sat there calmly. Her right hand reached out and casually took hold of the seven-inch python. Her lips curved up slightly. Smiling, she said, “You’re quite capable, aren’t you? Perfect for medicinal use!”

“Let go of it!”

A man’s voice rang out behind her, cold as ice.

Qiao Nian turned her head to glance at the man. He was wearing a spotlessly white shirt that accentuated his tall figure. The top two buttons of his shirt were unbuttoned, and right above it was a handsome face—so handsome it was nearly suffocating to look at.

His facial features were well-defined, with a pair of sharp eyebrows. His eyes were like stars, but they were cold.

“Who are you?” Qiao Nian raised her eyebrow slightly. She could just about guess his identity. To be able to play with snakes so brazenly in the Gu residence, this man had to be the ugly and short-lived Second Young Master, Gu Zhou!

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian and raised his eyebrow as well, exuding a strong sense of oppressiveness. “You’re not Qiao Xin!”

His words clearly hinted at danger. Qiao Nian smiled and said, “I’m her elder sister, Qiao Nian!”

Seeing Gu Zhou’s displeased face, Qiao Nian shook the snake in her hand and said, “It was lucky that you spoke fast. Otherwise, I would have turned it into medicine!”

As Qiao Nian spoke, she let go of the snake in her hand. The blue-green python seemed to nurse a grievance as it silently slithered onto Gu Zhou’s shoulder. It lowered its little head, looking pitiful.

Gu Zhou sized Qiao Nian up. She wasn’t tall, but she had rather exquisite features and had a good figure. His gaze finally landed on Qiao Nian’s hands.

Her hands weren’t big, and her slender fingers looked like they could be broken just by the wind.. He would never have expected such a pair of delicate hands to be able to grab his python.
