732 Why Was It Impossible?

One had to know that only in dreams could there be a possibility of revival.

Lu Rao shook his head. Before Lu Zhu could speak, he continued, “How… how is that possible? Isn’t Sugar already…”

“Why not?” Lu Zhu said with a serious expression, interrupting Lu Rao mercilessly. He did not want Lu Rao to say those unpleasant words.

Lu Rao was stunned. His pupils involuntarily dilated as he looked at Lu Zhu in disbelief, repeatedly savoring Lu Zhu’s words.

“Brother, you mean…”

Sugar was still alive.

Moreover, Qiao Nian was Sugar.

This was simply too fantastical.

Lu Rao did not need to ask everything. When he saw Lu Zhu nod, he was stunned!

Lu Rao’s eyes couldn’t help but turn red. He choked. He couldn’t believe that Sugar was still alive.

In the past, he had always imagined that Sugar was not dead. Sugar was still living in some corner of the world.

However, everyone in the family told him that Sugar was no longer around.

He gradually accepted the fact that Sugar had left.

Lu Rao had never expected his Sugar to really be alive.

Lu Rao tried his best to calm down. He looked at Lu Zhu intently and said, “She’s really Sugar!”

Lu Zhu nodded.

“But if it’s Sugar, I thought she would be crippled…” Lu Rao felt that something was wrong.

“Back then, someone schemed against our Lu family, and Sugar has always been alive!” Lu Zhu nodded seriously.

Hearing Lu Zhu’s words, Lu Ran still found it a little strange. He asked, “I remember that Mother personally did the appraisal back then. How could this be wrong?”

Hearing Lu Rao’s question, Lu Zhu fell silent.

Back then, her mother had indeed done the DNA test herself. That was why everyone firmly believed that Sugar was no longer around.

What made everyone feel the most uncomfortable was that Sugar had been dismembered by a villain when she died. That kind of death was really too tragic.

Back then, their mother was a great expert in forensics. She had personally appraised the broken arm she had found and confirmed that the results of the previous forensic doctor were correct.

Their mother had no choice but to accept the fact that Sugar had passed away. It was precisely because of this that their mother fell ill in bed and only recovered a year later.

What exactly was going on?

Everyone was puzzled.

Previously, he hadn’t told Qiao Nian that his mother had personally done a DNA test because he was worried that Sugar would misunderstand and think that his mother wanted to kill her.

All these years, Sugar had been living in another home.

He didn’t want Sugar to have a grudge against his mother.

Lu Zhu went to Lu Rao’s side and whispered about his reunion with Qiao Nian.

With that, Lu Zhu said, “Ah Rao, although I know this sounds unbelievable, it’s impossible for the paternity test results to be wrong!”

Tears welled up in Ah Rao’s eyes. He nodded vigorously. After a long while, he said, “Brother, I understand what you mean. I believe you because when I first saw her, I had a good impression of her. I understand now. So it’s blood ties that made me have a good impression of her!”

With that, Ah Rao turned around and walked out.

Lu Zhu looked at Lu Rao in confusion, then hurriedly stopped him. “What are you going to do now?”

“To bring my sister back, of course, so that she can acknowledge Grandma!” Lu Rao said excitedly, his eyes filled with laughter.

Lu Zhu’s expression darkened. “My sister and I have long acknowledged each other. Don’t you know why I didn’t bring her home?”

Lu Rao had just walked to the door of the study when he heard Lu Zhu’s words. He stopped in his tracks. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

He was a smart person. He was just too excited just now, so he said that Sugar and Grandma would acknowledge each other.

Hearing Lu Zhu’s words, Lu Rao quickly calmed down. He walked up to Lu Zhu and asked, “Brother, do you think the people who kidnapped Sugar are still alive?”

Lu Zhu nodded and said, “We have to investigate this matter thoroughly. If those people know that Sugar is still alive, I wonder what terrifying things they will do to her!”
