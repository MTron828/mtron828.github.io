Chapter 1750 - 1750 Danger

Lina looked at Qiao Nian worriedly. She hesitated for a moment before sitting down in front of Qiao Nian. With a serious expression, she said, “Nian Nian, it’s too dangerous over there. If we’re rash, we might just be courting death.”

When Qiao Nian heard Lina’s words, a gentle smile appeared on her face. She said, “Lina, I’ll go over there myself. With your current status, it’s not suitable for you to go over there. I…”

“Nian Nian.” Lina shook her head disapprovingly. She held Qiao Nian’s hand tightly and said, “I’ll go with you.”

“There’s really no need. I…”

However, before Qiao Nian could finish speaking, she was interrupted by Lina.

“Nian Nian, I’m really not afraid. Let’s find a time to go together!” Lina’s eyes were extremely serious.

Qiao Nian’s refusal was stuck in her mouth. She looked at Lina intently. In the end, she seemed to have thought of something. She smiled and nodded.

Actually, she wanted to say that if she went alone, she would be more agile and less likely to be discovered.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

At night, the moon was bright and the stars were sparse.

Mark’s manor was huge. There was some distance between them and the castle.

Qiao Nian and Lina were both wearing dark black clothes. The two of them avoided the street lamps and walked carefully in the garden.

Qiao Nian had already checked the deployment of the personnel in Mark’s manor. It was actually similar to the patrolling personnel in the basement. The only difference was that the patrolling guards here were all Mark’s trusted aides and were familiar with one another.

This was the first time Lina had done such a thing. She was so nervous that her heart was in her throat. She looked at the tightly shut door not far away and asked uncertainly, “Nian Nian, are we really going in through the door?”

The two of them had secretly checked the situation here and entered through the main door. No matter how they thought about it, it was strange.

Qiao Nian looked around, then locked her gaze on the main door. She said calmly, “I’ve already checked the surroundings of the castle just now. Almost all of them have alarm systems set up. There are no blind spots. As long as we approach the castle, the alarm will sound.”

Qiao Nian wanted to hack into the alarm system, but she was afraid of alerting the enemy, so she could only enter through the main door.

Lina did not know whether to laugh or cry. She said, “Actually, if we enter through the main door, we can enter openly!”

Qiao Nian looked at the watch on her wrist and couldn’t help but laugh. She said, “I guess so. The patrol guards will leave in a minute. When the next wave of guards comes, that’ll be five minutes later. We’ll try to go in during the gaps in their patrols.”

After the patrolling guards walked over, Qiao Nian walked into the shadow area. This was also a blind spot for cameras. She arrived at the entrance of the castle.

Lina followed Qiao Nian closely. She clenched her fists tightly and kept looking around, afraid that someone would notice them.

The two of them stood in front of the six-meter-tall door, looking very small and oppressive.

Lina looked at the closed door and tentatively turned the handle to push it in. Realizing that she couldn’t push it, her eyes were filled with confusion. She said in a low voice, “Nian Nian, what should we do? This door is locked.”

When she said this, Lina looked at the six-meter-tall and four-meter-wide door and was filled with surprise.

When she came here before, this door had been open. She did not think it was very tall. Now that she was standing here, she realized how tall it was.

Qiao Nian took off her hairpin and said softly, “That’s easy.”

Lina was stunned for a moment. Just as she was about to ask a question, she saw the smile in Qiao Nian’s eyes grow brighter. Then, she placed the barrette into the lock. After a few moves, the lock opened.

Lina’s eyes widened. She couldn’t help but ask, “Nian Nian, do all the people in Country Z know how to open locks?”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. Then, she shook her head and said, “No.”

As she spoke, Qiao Nian slowly pushed open the door.

Lina was extremely nervous. The two of them hurried in and did not forget to close the door.
