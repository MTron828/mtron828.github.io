1329 Going Back

Qiao Nian’s only regret was that she hadn’t been able to see them grow up.

Although she had been absent for six years, she could grow up with them in the future.

Qiao Nian watched as Xiao Bao put on his clothes. Xiao Bao got out of bed and put on his shoes. Then, he walked to the bathroom and stood in front of the sink to wash up.

After Xiao Bao packed up, Qiao Nian saw a rich young master standing in front of her. He looked extremely adorable.

Qiao Nian reached out and took Xiao Bao’s hand as they walked out. “Let’s go, baby.”

Xiao Bao looked at Qiao Nian’s smiling face and smiled sweetly. Mommy was so gentle. He liked being with her so much.

As for Daddy and Uncle Feng, he would think of them when he had spare time!

Qiao Nian had just opened the door when she saw Lu Jiang standing there.

Lu Jiang immediately saw Xiao Bao beside Qiao Nian. A smile appeared on his face. He bent down and picked Xiao Bao up. He reached out and scratched Xiao Bao’s nose. Smiling, he said, “You’re awake!”

Lu Jiang had taken Xiao Bao back with him last night. The two of them were already very close.

Xiao Bao nodded vigorously. Then, he looked at Qiao Nian and kissed her cheek. In a childish voice, he said, “Mommy, go to bed!”

“Okay, I’ll go to bed now.” Qiao Nian looked at Xiao Bao, who was acting like an adult, and her eyes were filled with smiles.

Lu Jiang looked at the dark circles under Qiao Nian’s eyes and frowned. His heart ached as he said, “You should sleep early. Let me take care of Xiao Bao first. We’ll talk when you wake up!”

Qiao Nian nodded. “Okay.”

Qiao Nian turned around and entered the room. She lay back down on the bed and fell asleep.

Qiao Nian slept for the entire morning and woke up at noon. She had lunch with Lu Jiang and Xiao Bao.

Seeing how haggard Qiao Nian was, Lu Jiang picked up a piece of meat and placed it in her bowl. He said softly, “Eat more. You’ve only been in MY for a few days, but you’re already so thin that you’re all skin and bones.”

“Fourth Brother, I’m fine.” Qiao Nian smiled.

“Do you want to leave in the afternoon?” At this point, Lu Jiang glanced at Xiao Bao beside him. “Xiao Bao isn’t safe here either. I’ve asked the doctor. Gu Zhou won’t be discharged for another week. When Gu Zhou recovers, he’ll go back himself.”

Xiao Bao blinked in confusion and asked in confusion, “Fourth Uncle, should Mommy and I leave first? What about Dad? Shall we leave Dad here alone?”

“Xiao Bao, don’t you want to see your brother and sister first? Your father is fine here. Fourth Uncle will take care of your father.” After Lu Jiang finished speaking to Xiao Bao, he looked at Qiao Nian and asked, “You still have two children at home. You should go back and take care of them. Children can’t be separated from their parents for too long.”

Qiao Nian nodded in agreement.

On the one hand, it was indeed dangerous for her and Xiao Bao to stay in MY. If Xiao Bao was not by her side, she had the ability to protect herself.

On the other hand, something had indeed happened in An City. She had to leave first! Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

She had just received a text from Grandma saying that Bai Hui was risking everything to take Gu Qi and Xiao Shi away.

Qiao Nian frowned. She had seen Bai Hui once. Bai Hui was the kind of person who was arrogant and rigid.

If the two children were by Bai Hui’s side, they would definitely live a very oppressive life.

Moreover, she felt that it was better for the two children to be by Grandma’s side and live a happier life.

In the afternoon, Qiao Nian left in Lu Jiang’s private plane with Xiao Bao. She didn’t even take him to the hospital.

Before leaving, Xiao Bao only called Gu Zhou and instructed him to rest well.

The plane took off. Xiao Bao stayed in Qiao Nian’s arms and blinked in confusion. “Mommy, I still want to see Dad. I can’t see his true situation on the phone.”

Seeing how obedient and filial Xiao Bao was, Qiao Nian’s lips curved up slightly. She said softly, “It’s fine. Your father must be very happy to know that you’re filial. Don’t worry.”

“Yes, how are Dad’s injuries?” Xiao Bao asked seriously, staring unblinkingly at Qiao Nian.

“He’s fine, but Dad still has work to do. He can’t come home with us.” Qiao Nian patted Xiao Bao’s head and said gently.
