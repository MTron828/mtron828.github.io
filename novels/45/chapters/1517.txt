1518 Heartache for Him

But now that she was the only one left in the family, the only thing she could do was support the family. If she fell too, this family would really be gone.

Only then did she notice that her father’s face was already wrinkled. His hair was a little white at the temples.

In a daze, Lina recalled when she was young. At that time, her father and uncle were still very close. They would take her and Sister Annie to the forest to hunt.

She didn’t know when it began, but her father and Uncle’s relationship had been getting worse and worse.

They were clearly family. Could the position of president make a family turn against each other?

Lina couldn’t understand. She took a deep breath and walked out again. She wondered if the butler had treated Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian well.

Lina walked towards the backyard. When she passed by the pavilion, she saw Chen Qing leaning against a rocking chair.

She walked towards Chen Qing and was about to greet him when she noticed that he had already fallen asleep.

Chen Qing leaned back in his rocking chair and placed his hands in front of him. There was still scarlet blood on his right hand, and his white shirt made him look especially eye-catching.

Lina’s expression changed slightly. Previously, when Annie had thrown a stone at her and the stone had almost hit her, Chen Qing had grabbed it. That was why she was not injured.

Chen Qing had suffered this injury on her behalf.

At that time, she had noticed that the stone was sharp. In order to smash her face, Annie had deliberately picked a sharp stone.

His hand must be in pain!

There were dark circles under Chen Qing’s eyes. He looked very tired, which was why he had fallen asleep sitting here.

Seeing the wound on Chen Qing’s hand, a complicated look flashed in Lina’s eyes. She turned around and walked towards the servant not far away, asking, “Where’s the medicine box?”

The servant asked anxiously, “On the cabinet beside the living room. Princess, where are you injured? Do you want to call a doctor?”

“I’m fine. Go ahead.” With that, Lina sent the servant away.

She took the medicine box. When she returned to the pavilion again, she gently placed it on the stone table.

She sat beside him. The two of them were so close that she could clearly see every pore on his face.

Carefully, she unfolded Chen Qing’s injured hand. She first cleaned it with clear water, then disinfected it with alcohol. When all the wounds were exposed, she applied medicine to each one.

When Lina was applying the medicine, she was worried that she would wake Chen Qing up. She stole a few glances at Chen Qing. When Chen Qing’s wound was treated, she saw that he had not woken up. Only then did her heart, which had been in her throat, relax.

Lina’s heart was beating wildly.

His eyes were cold and so dark that there was no trace of impurity. It made one shiver.

Lina subconsciously took a step back and accidentally tripped over a stone bench, falling back uncontrollably.

Chen Qing was a bodyguard, so he slept very lightly. When he woke up, his professional eyes turned cold. When he saw that it was Lina, he saw that she was about to fall and reached out to pull her up.

However, his injured hand missed Lina’s arm.

Lina fell to the ground.

“Argh.” Chen Qing frowned.

He had subconsciously gone to pull Lina back just now with his injured hand. He had moved too much and pulled at the wound, causing him to frown in pain.

Lina had been a little embarrassed. How could she have been so stupid as to fall again?

However, when she heard Chen Qing groan in pain, she hurriedly stood up and held Chen Qing’s injured right hand with both hands. She asked nervously, “Your wound has opened again. Don’t tell me your wound has grown bigger?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The recliner behind Chen Qing swayed casually. He looked at Lina in front of him. Under the sunlight, her entire face looked much gentler.
