794 Comfort

Worried that Qiao Nian would be unwilling to tell him, Gu Zhou said again, “I’ll stand by your side forever!”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, her eyes gradually lit up, and the uneasiness in her heart gradually dissipated. She hesitated for a moment before asking, “Have you seen Mrs. Lu before?”

“I met her when I was young!” Gu Zhou said calmly. He thought that Qiao Nian missed her parents and immediately understood. “They all miss you. When do you plan to meet them?”

“Now that the enemy is in the dark and I’m in the light, it’s better to be careful!” Qiao Nian meant that she didn’t want to meet Mrs. Lu. She was really worried. If her kidnapping was related to Mrs. Lu, what should she do?

“You’re right, but if you meet online, there shouldn’t be any problems!” Gu Zhou said.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips and looked at Gu Zhou uneasily. “What do you think of Mrs. Lu?”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, a trace of confusion flashed in his eyes. However, he quickly understood why Qiao Nian’s expression had been off just now.

Could it be that someone was sowing discord?

With this thought in mind, Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian seriously and said word by word, “She’s a very good person and very gentle. Moreover, she loves you very much, more than she loves herself.”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, the dark clouds in her heart instantly disappeared. The sun came out, and so did the rainbow.

Her entire world became warm and bright.

Gu Zhou’s words were very convincing, and she couldn’t help but believe them.

Her mother must have loved her.

If her mother didn’t love her, why would she be in pain because of her departure? Why would she build an ancestral hall for her? Why would she leave this sad place?

“You’re her first daughter. To her, you’re extremely special.” Gu Zhou held Qiao Nian’s hand tightly and continued, “Before she gave birth to you, she had always wanted a daughter. Unfortunately, her wish never came true. She had been looking forward to this for a long time!”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she felt a little sad.

She had even suspected that her mother had kidnapped her just now. She really shouldn’t have.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou and smiled. “Thank you!”

If Gu Zhou hadn’t told her this, she might have gone too far.

It seemed that what one saw might not be true.

If Mom had done the DNA test herself, why hadn’t she found anything wrong? Could someone have swapped Mom’s samples?

It seemed that she had to start investigating from the forensics department.

Gu Zhou tucked Qiao Nian’s hair behind her ear and said gently, “Breakfast is ready. Xiao Qi is waiting for you downstairs! I’ll go down and wait for you first!”

“I’ll go down after I’m done packing!” Qiao Nian said with a smile. Seeing Gu Zhou turn to leave, her gaze fell on his back.

Although Gu Zhou was not in good health, his figure was still not bad.

From behind, Gu Zhou’s back looked tall and imposing, making one feel very safe.

For a moment, Qiao Nian felt that Gu Zhou’s back looked a little familiar. In a daze, she seemed to have seen him somewhere before.

Qiao Nian retracted her gaze and continued putting on her makeup.

After packing up, Qiao Nian walked downstairs.

She had just walked downstairs when she saw Xiao Shi, who was sitting on the sofa, immediately stand up.

“Auntie Nian Nian!” Xiao Shi called out, running towards Qiao Nian.

Xiao Shi ran up to Qiao Nian and grabbed her right hand. She looked up and gave Qiao Nian a sweet smile. “Good morning!”

“Good morning, Xiao Qi. How was your sleep last night?” Qiao Nian asked gently. She reached out and touched her little face. It felt so good!

Xiao Shi recalled the story Auntie Nian Nian had told her last night.

This was the first time she had heard a bedtime story.

Although she couldn’t remember the dream last night, she knew that it was a very sweet dream!

“Thank you, Auntie Nian Nian, for telling me a bedtime story!” Xiao Shi said gratefully. She would always remember the story Auntie Nian Nian had told her. She wondered if she would have the chance to listen to Auntie Nian Nian tell her a story in the future.

“If you like listening to my bedtime stories, I’ll tell you more in the future!” Qiao Nian said gently.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m
