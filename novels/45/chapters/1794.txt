Chapter 1795 - 1795 Confusion

Cui Si would never forget the scene of Cui Lang dying in front of him. He bit his lip tightly. “You got someone to threaten Princess Annie and let her kill my youngest son, Cui Qi, in court. You really killed our entire family.”

When Cui Si found out that Cui Qi was dead, he could not sit still anymore. He only wanted to kill the president and avenge his family.

When the President heard Cui Si’s words, he frowned and said, “What are you talking about? I’ve never killed Cui Lang, let alone asked Annie to kill Cui Qi. Besides, I’ve never thought of attacking the Cui family.”

Cui Si had long guessed that the president would deny it. After all, what would a person like the president dare to do to survive? “Do you think I’ll believe your flowery words? As a president, you’re full of lies. You should save your energy. After all, you still have a long way to go after you die.”

“Stop!” A clear female voice sounded from afar. “The president didn’t lie to you. You’ve been deceived by Mark for so many years!”

Cui Si had wanted his subordinates to make a move, but he did not expect someone to interrupt. He turned his head and saw Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian standing at the side.

When Qiao Nian saw Cui Si look over, she knew that he was very interested in what she had said. She heaved a sigh of relief. It seemed that they could continue the conversation.

Qiao Nian’s gaze inadvertently landed on Chen Qing’s face. She saw that Lina was supporting Chen Qing with red eyes, as if she had cried.

Could Chen Qing be injured?

Qiao Nian lowered her head and said to Gu Zhou, “Explain it to him. I’ll go see Chen Qing now.”

Gu Zhou nodded slightly. He looked at Cui Si, who was not far away. His cold eyes were filled with a faint distance as he went straight to the point. “Cui Qi is still alive!”

Hearing Gu Zhou’s words, Cui Si’s pupils dilated uncontrollably. He looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief, unable to believe what he had said.

Gu Zhou glanced at everyone and understood what they meant. His gaze landed on the small house on the stage. That small house was for the wedding. There was a lot of glass hanging on the colorful house. He guessed that many young ladies would like such things.

Mark followed Gu Zhou’s gaze and his expression became complicated. This ornament was Qiao Nian’s wedding gift to Lina. At that time, Qiao Nian and the others had directly moved the things over and placed them on the stage.

At that time, he had taken a look at the house. It was four to five meters tall and did not take up much space. At that time, this house had been sent in as a gift, so he had avoided inspection.

“Professor Ollie, come out now.”

As soon as Gu Zhou finished speaking, the door of the small house moved slightly. Professor Ollie came out of the one-meter-tall door. When he saw the situation at the event location, he was stunned.

Professor Ollie pursed his lips uncomfortably and tidied his clothes, pretending to be calm.

He was extremely excited. He finally experienced how it was like to be a battlefield doctor appearing at a critical moment.

It was simply too exciting.

However, after staying inside the house for so long, he still could not make a sound. He was too aggrieved.

“Wait, don’t be anxious.” Dr. Ollie smiled and bent down to pull out the wheelchair inside.

The person sitting in the wheelchair was none other than Cui Qi. Then, Dr. Ollie opened the medicine box beside the wheelchair and injected the antidote into Cui Qi’s blood vessels.

Cui Si, who was standing at the side, looked at Cui Qi expectantly. The anger in his eyes gradually disappeared, and tears wet his eyes. He pursed his lips tightly and did not dare to speak.

Cui Qi, his youngest son and only son, was actually still alive.

After Dr. Ollie finished administering the medicine, Cui Qi’s tightly shut eyes slowly opened.

Tears of excitement slowly fell from Cui Si’s eyes. He could not help but take a step forward, wanting to hold his son’s hand and feel the warmth of his body.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m
