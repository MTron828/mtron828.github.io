1479 What Gift?

She glanced at Chen Qing worriedly, her gaze finally landing on Wright’s face. She rebuked angrily, “Wright, you’ve gone too far!”

Wright walked elegantly to Lina and subconsciously wanted to hug her.

But before he could hug Lina, she pushed him away.

The expression on Wright’s face faltered slightly. His eyes narrowed slightly, hiding the displeasure in them.

Lina frowned and questioned angrily, “How long are you going to continue fooling around!”

“Lina, you don’t know how worried I am about you. I heard from others that you were injured.” Wright looked at Lina worriedly and said affectionately, “When I found out about this, I heard that you were out of danger and had been brought home by the president.”

Lina could clearly see the scheme in Wright’s eyes. She had never seen such a brazen person.

If she were Wright, she would never appear in front of her again.

“Lina, you’re the person I care about the most. I came to see you today to give you a gift.” Wright smiled at Lina and said gently, “I’m sure you’ll like my gift to you very much.”

Lina felt her back go numb. She had a bad feeling about this. She frowned at Wright and hesitated for a long time before asking, “What gift?”

“I just know that you will like my gift very much.” Wright’s lips curved up slightly, and his face was filled with a bright smile. His gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face, who was beside Lina.

At this moment, Qiao Nian was standing against the light. Although he couldn’t see the expression on her face, his people told him that if it weren’t for this woman, his plan would definitely have succeeded.

This woman was an obstacle on his path to success. It seemed that he had to think of a way to eliminate this woman in the future. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

What made him most uncomfortable was that this woman’s eyes were very cold. He was like prey being stared at by a wild beast.

Wright narrowed his eyes and looked at Qiao Nian coldly. He couldn’t lose in terms of aura.

Lina’s mind was filled with the gift Wright had mentioned. This wasn’t a festive occasion. Why would Wright give her a gift?

When Chen Qing noticed Wright’s gaze, he took a step to the side, imperceptibly blocking Wright’s view.

Wright looked at Chen Qing in front of him and his expression darkened. He snorted and said unhappily, “Any Tom, Dick, or Harry really dares to hang around in front of me.”

“So this is the world in the eyes of a mad dog,” Chen Qing said, his expression as calm as ever, as if he hadn’t seen the anger in Wright’s eyes.

“You…” Before Wright could say anything, Lina interrupted him.

Wright moved his gaze from Chen Qing’s face to Lina’s. His gaze softened as well. He snorted and said, “Lina, I’m sure you’ll like this gift very much.”

Lina frowned slightly. She didn’t know why Wright needed to drive the truck over. Could the gift be that big?

The secretary opened the back door of the truck. Lina looked up and saw someone hanging in the middle of the truck. When she saw that person’s face clearly, she felt as if she was in an icehouse.

The person was hanging in midair. No, it should be a corpse. The corpse was hanging in midair. The corpse was in tattered clothes, and there were many marks of whiplash on it. There were bright red bloodstains that were shocking.

The eyes of the corpse seemed to have been dug out, leaving only two badly mangled holes.

Lina’s face was pale, and her lips were trembling. She felt terrible in her stomach, and she almost threw up.

In a panic, she took two steps back. Her legs gave way and she fell back uncontrollably.
