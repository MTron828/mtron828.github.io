Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou. Gu Zhou seemed to be determined to get to the bottom of this. He looked like he wouldn’t sleep until he asked about it clearly.

Qiao Nian really couldn’t do anything to Gu Zhou. She pursed her lips slightly and could only consider Gu Zhou’s question seriously.

She thought for a long time before looking at Gu Zhou and saying in a low voice, “If I tell the truth, you have to promise that you won’t be angry.” However, Gu Zhou did not react at all.

Qiao Nian could only say softly, “Um, other than kinship, you’re first in my heart.’

The more she spoke, the less confident she became. Her heart was beating wildly as she stole a glance at Gu Zhou. She knew very well that Gu Zhou wanted to hear that he was in the first place.

However, she did not want to lie to Gu Zhou about this.

Seeing that Gu Zhou was silent, she suddenly panicked. She took the initiative to hug Gu Zhou’s waist and said softly, “Look, the children are also yours. I . . . ”

However, before she could finish speaking, Gu Zhou stopped her without hesitation.

She panicked and still didn’t understand what had happened. Feeling Gu Zhou’s gentle kiss, her uneasy heart gradually calmed down, and her body softened.

Just as Qiao Nian was about to suffocate, Gu Zhou let go of her lips and hugged her shoulders naturally. His voice was a little hoarse. “It’s enough.”

That was enough.

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s voice, her heart skipped a beat. She recalled what had happened to Gu Zhou when he was young. She looked up at Gu Zhou and saw that his face was no longer as cold as usual. He had softened and was completely different from usual.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou uneasily and said in a low voice, “Ah Zhou, are you feeling unwell?”

Gu Zhou’s lips curved up slightly, revealing a faint smile. He rested his head on Qiao Nian’s and looked ahead blankly, saying in a low voice, “I was very envious of them today.”

Hearing Gu Zhou’s gentle and fragile voice, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but want to hug him.

Gu Zhou’s childhood had been unfortunate and painful.

Qiao Nian hugged Gu Zhou and buried her head in his shoulder. In a low voice, she said, “I’ll always be with you in the future. No matter what, we’ll always be together. I’ll also pay more attention to you and take care of your emotions.”

“No.” Gu Zhou gave a low laugh and gently rubbed Qiao Nian t s chin. “l saw today that you cared so much about our children and took care of them wholeheartedly. Although this is your first time being a mother, you’re a very competent mother.”

Qiao Nian hugged Gu Zhou gently. In the past, Gu Zhou had not received sound maternal love, but she could give him a holistic type of love.

“Ah Zhou, actually, 1 . . . ”

Qiao Nian hesitated. At this moment, she felt that it was useless to say anything else. She looked up slightly and took the initiative to kiss Gu Zhou’s

A few days later.

An City International Airport.

At this moment, there were many people standing at the VIP exit of the airport. Many of the people who had come to pick them up were standing in a comprehensive manner, but they were all pushed back by men in casual clothes.

The men had one thing in common. They were all wearing Bluetooth earpieces and looking determinedly down the tunnel.

Many people came out of the passageway. They were in groups of twos and threes, chatting and laughing.

At this moment, a group of people walked out. A man in a well-tailored suit stood outside the group, and two people stood at the innermost corner. The girl walking on the left was wearing a white woolen coat and a red scarf around her neck. Her long curly hair fell over her shoulders, making her look sweet and obedient.

Her beautiful eyes looked around. This was the first time she had been here and she was a little curious. After looking around, she spoke to the noble person beside her.

“Mom, are you affected by your surroundings?”

The woman was wearing a black coat and a hat. Although she was wearing a mask, her skin was as fair as snow. It was obvious that she was a beauty.

Shen Mei’s eyes were filled with confusion. After a while, she said, “l don’t know either.’

Lina took Shen Mei t s arm and said with a smile, “Mom, don’t think about it if you can’t remember. It’s fine. Moreover, Nian Nian called me previously and told me that her master is also here. I heard that her master is a divine doctor. With him around, your illness will definitely recover..”Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com
