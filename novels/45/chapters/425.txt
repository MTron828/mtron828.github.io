Chapter 426: Eat Rocks!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Everyone looked at Qiao Nian enviously. They also wanted to be the lucky ones.

However, when they thought of themselves, they all fell silent.

One of them had lost all his money playing stone gambling previously, so he had sold his family’s ancestral residence to fight for a chance of survival.

However, when he saw that Qiao Nian had bet two hundred yuan and received glass imperial jade, he knew that his last hope was gone. He almost fainted!

He trembled as he held onto the chair beside him, barely managing to stand.

Why?

Was God so unfair to him?

He had lost hundreds of millions of yuan in stone gambling. Why didn’t the heavens give him a chance to get an imperial jade?

Gao Hong looked at the jadeite in Qiao Nian’s hand in shock. She felt as if she had been slapped, and her face burned with pain.

Previously, she had been suspicious of Qiao Nian. She felt that it was impossible for her to get anything good from a raw stone that cost 200 yuan.

However, she had never expected that Qiao Nian would really open it. If that piece of jade was exchanged for money, it would be equivalent to her entire family’s assets.

Why hadn’t she seen the value of this stone?

She had also noticed that Qiao Nian had been staring at the stone. However, she didn’t believe that there was any good jade in it, so she didn’t bother to snatch it from her.

......

Due to this, she had lost more than a billion yuan!

The others looked at the jade in Qiao Nian’s hand with envy. This was because this piece of jade had been placed in the first display case. They had seen it as soon as they had entered, but they hadn’t taken it seriously at all.

The uncut stone that they looked down on the most actually had an imperial jade. This was simply rubbing their faces against the ground!

At this moment, Zhang Yong could no longer describe his feelings. His body was trembling. He had almost cut open the imperial green jade.

If he had really cut it just now, even if it was an imperial green jade, it would have been gone!

Ah Rao glanced at the people around him, and his lips curled into a cold smile. He snapped his fingers lightly!

Everyone was shocked by this sound and turned their attention to Ah Rao.

Ah Rao said casually, “Who said that if this raw stone produced imperial jade, he would eat all the gravel!”

As soon as he said this, the onlookers’ hearts rose to their throats.

Oh no, this was payback!

The person who had just said this took a few steps back silently. They wanted to leave quietly.

Ah Rao glanced over with a sharp gaze, his gaze was locked on that person’s face. He said coldly, “Didn’t you want to eat gravel?”

Although it was a question, it didn’t sound like one.

The man’s face was pale with fear, and his legs were trembling.

Qiao Nian’s lips curled up slightly. She really liked Ah Rao’s personality. He was someone who didn’t want to be wronged at all.

She handed the imperial green jade to the old cutting master and said, “Please help me wrap it up!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The cutting teacher held the imperial jade with trembling hands. He carefully wrapped it in a gift box and handed it to Qiao Nian.

“Thank you!”

Holding the gift box, Qiao Nian casually picked up a piece of gravel and threw it to Ah Rao. “Ah Rao!”

As if they were of the same mind, Ah Rao raised his hand and caught the gravel. His gaze landed on that person’s face.

That person was so frightened that he swallowed his saliva and broke out in a cold sweat. He regretted talking big just now!

This man actually really wanted him to eat rocks!

Ah Rao walked towards the man. Seeing that he was still not coming over, a cold glint flashed across his eyes. He said angrily, “Didn’t you say that you wanted to eat gravel? Come over quickly!”

In the past, Sun Zhi definitely wouldn’t even have looked at Ah Rao. But now, it was different. Qiao Nian’s imperial jade had instantly skyrocketed in value, and it was no longer something he could compare to.
