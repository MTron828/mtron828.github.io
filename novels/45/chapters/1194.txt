There were no corrosive scars on her face. Her smooth and fair face was like a freshly cooked and peeled egg. The charm in her eyes was soul-stirring.

Thank you readers!

At this moment, Jiang Yue had already returned to her usual appearance, but her temperament was completely different from before.

Qiao Nian stood there calmly. If she wasn’t wrong, Jiang Yue must have undergone a skin graft or used some other method to rework her appearance.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on the man beside Jiang Yue. The man wasn’t tall, and he had a beer belly. There was a gold chain around his neck, and the words “nouveau riche” were written all over him!

Boss Jin.

He was also an old acquaintance.

The last time she came here to participate in stone gambling, Boss Jin had also come. Unfortunately, the young model Boss Jin had brought back then had died.

Gu Zhou also noticed Jiang Yue. He glanced at her indifferently, then retracted his gaze. His gaze fell on Qiao Nian again. The coldness in his eyes instantly disappeared, and his gaze softened.

When Boss Jin saw Qiao Nian, his eyes lit up. He walked up to Qiao Nian with Jiang Yue in his arms and greeted her with a smile, “Miss Qiao, what a coincidence. We meet again.”

After Boss Jin greeted Qiao Nian, his gaze fell on the man beside her.

This man looked like a young master from a comic book. He exuded a regal aura. His facial features were a little familiar. He seemed to have seen him somewhere before, but he couldn’t remember where.

Boss Jin asked very politely, “Miss Qiao, may I know who this gentleman is…”

“Gu Zhou.” After Qiao Nian finished speaking, she sensed Gu Zhou’s displeasure. She knew that Gu Zhou didn’t like her to talk much to other men. Her lips curved up slightly as she added, “He’s my husband!”

“Gu Zhou.” After Qiao Nian finished speaking, she sensed Gu Zhou’s displeasure. She knew that Gu Zhou didn’t like her to talk much to other men. Her lips curved up slightly as she added, “He’s my husband!”

He’s my husband!

Gu Zhou replayed Qiao Nian’s words over and over again, his heart filled with pride. His Nian’er had introduced him to outsiders, and in such a grand manner. The more he thought about it, the happier he became.

At this moment, he felt that the pot bellied Boss Jin had also become adorable, like a fat cat.

Gu Zhou’s lips curved up slightly as he said softly, “Boss Jin, I’ve heard a lot about you!”

In Nancheng, everyone knew Boss Jin.

Jiang Yue stared unblinkingly at Gu Zhou’s face. Seeing the smile on Gu Zhou’s face, her gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s hand, which was wrapped around Qiao Nian’s waist. She hurriedly lowered her gaze, hiding the ruthlessness in her eyes.

Brother Ah Zhou hated it when women touched him, but he took the initiative to hug Qiao Nian’s waist.

Qiao Nian, that b*tch. She had stolen her Brother Ah Zhou and even disfigured her.

However, now that Brother Ah Zhou wanted to make the fact that the two of them were married public, he had changed a lot.

Why wasn’t she the one who made Brother Ah Zhou change?

The more Jiang Yue thought about it, the more hatred she felt. She yearned to trample Qiao Nian to death and ensure that she would never be reincarnated.

Boss Jin hurriedly extended his hand to shake Gu Zhou’s. Smiling, he said, “So it’s Second Young Master Gu. It’s an honor to meet you!”

After the two of them let go, Boss Jin looked at Jiang Yue beside him and said with a smile, “Jiang Yue is also from An City. She said that she used to take care of Matriarch Gu in the Gu family. Perhaps you’ve even met her before!”

When Jiang Yue heard Boss Jin’s words, she couldn’t help but feel nervous. She didn’t know if Brother Ah Zhou was still willing to acknowledge her.

After she was chased out of the Gu family, she was too embarrassed to tell outsiders that she was the young lady of the Gu family, so she said that she had once worked in the Gu family.

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on Jiang Yue, who was beside Boss Jin. His expression instantly turned cold, but he quickly looked away and said coldly, “I’m not familiar with her!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Boss Jin was slightly stunned. He was just being polite. He did not expect Gu Zhou to give such a straightforward answer. For a moment, he did not know what to say!

At this moment, the atmosphere became very awkward.

Jiang Yue lowered her gaze to hide the hurt in her eyes. She did not expect Brother Ah Zhou to say that he was not familiar with her.
