Chapter 1814 - 1814 Shy

After Lu Qi finished speaking, she looked shyly at Qin Chuan, who was standing at the side. She pursed her lips tightly and did not speak.

Qiao Nian naturally saw Lu Qi’s cheap shot. The corners of her lips curled up slightly, but there was no smile in her eyes. “Qin Chuan, when we came in just now, you seemed to have recognized Eldest Senior Brother and Grandpa at a glance.”

Qin Chuan should have long remembered the past. His words were no different from before. Logically speaking, he could have been discharged directly.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

She wanted to personally examine Qin Chuan’s body and see if he had recovered.

Lu Qi stood beside Qiao Nian and sensed the murderous look in Qiao Nian’s eyes as she looked at Senior Brother. She hurriedly said, “Sister, actually, I took the initiative to suggest that matter first. Senior Brother didn’t lie to me.”

Lu Qi reached out and held Qiao Nian’s arm, not wanting her to be angry anymore.

Qiao Nian looked at how Lu Qi was protecting Qin Chuan and felt a little helpless. “Do you think I’m angry?”

Lu Qi blinked in confusion.

Qin Chuan’s beautiful peach blossom eyes were glistening, and there was some confusion in his eyes.

He didn’t seem to understand Nian Nian’s current attitude.

Qiao Nian pulled Lu Qi to the side and sat down. She looked at Qin Chuan with a faint smile and then at Lu Qi dotingly.

Lu Qi sat obediently on the sofa and looked at Qiao Nian intently.

“I’ve known Qin Chuan for so many years, so I naturally know what kind of person he is. I’ll definitely be at ease and agree with you being with him.” Seeing Lu Qi heave a sigh of relief, Qiao Nian said slowly, “But Qiqi, is there really a romantic relationship between you and him, or are you just repaying a favor?”

She remembered that Lu Qi seemed to be interested in Qin Chuan previously, but it was not obvious.

But not long after, the two of them became engaged?

No matter how she looked at it, she was very puzzled.

Qin Chuan, who was sitting at the side, did not wait for Lu Qi to speak. He looked at Qiao Nian with a rare serious expression. “Actually, I hope that Qiqi can spend the rest of her life with me. I took this opportunity to suggest it today because I want Qiqi to know my feelings.”

When Lu Qi heard Qin Chuan’s words, she looked up at him and met his affectionate eyes.

“Qiqi, you can slowly think about our relationship. No matter what you choose, my feelings for you won’t change,” Qin Chuan said solemnly.

Lu Qi’s heart pounded violently. She could tell that Qin Chuan was serious, as if he had made a promise specially for her.

Lu Qi glanced at Old Miracle Doctor Qin and Eldest Senior Brother, whom she had met for the first time, and saw that they were all looking at Qin Chuan.

When she was in school, she often heard from her good friends say that if a person really likes you and loves you, they can’t wait to announce the good news that you’re together.

Lu Qi still remembered that after the tunnel collapsed, Senior Brother had forgotten his previous memories and thought that the two of them were husband and wife.

She sat there, blushing. Actually, she understood her feelings, but she was also a little uneasy.

Qiao Nian teased, “Qiqi, this is simple. Test Qin Chuan well and make a decision slowly.”

Chang Feng nodded in agreement. “You can’t make a rash decision. Qiqi, you have to take it slow and make Qin Chuan anxious.”

Lu Qi, whose name had been mentioned, sat there with her head lowered shyly.

As Lu Qi had only brought a meal for Qin Chuan, there was not enough for the five of them. Hence, the group of them went straight to the restaurant opposite the hospital to eat.

After a meal, the group walked towards the hospital.

Qiao Nian and Chang Feng walked beside Old Master Qin. The three of them walked in front, with Qin Chuan and Lu Qi following behind.

“Grandpa, I still remember that Nian Nian kept thinking about the wine you brewed yourself. If you hadn’t specially hidden it, that jar of wine might have been secretly drunk by Nian Nian long ago.” Chang Feng unkindly exposed Qiao Nian’s past.

Qiao Nian smiled and agreed. “That’s right, Grandpa. I wanted to drink that jar of wine at that time, but the next day, the wine jar disappeared.”
