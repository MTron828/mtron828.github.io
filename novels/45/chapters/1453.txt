1454 Thank You

Wright narrowed his eyes. Although he hadn’t been able to take Lina away just now, that didn’t matter. Lina’s arm was definitely hopeless.

If Lina was still the healthy princess from before, she would still be very valuable.

But if Lina was a crippled princess, then Lina was not worth much.

That fool, Lina, refused to follow him no matter what. She had wasted so much time. That arm must be crippled.

With this thought in mind, Wright gradually calmed down.

Lina would be a cripple. If he could still disregard the past and be with Lina, he would be the national husband of the entire European country.

Wright thought of Gu Zhou and that woman again. He had a nagging feeling that those two people were an interference. In order to complete his great undertaking, he had to chase them out as soon as possible!

“Go and investigate Gu Zhou’s relationship with the woman beside him now.”

“Yes!”

After Wright hung up, his eyes darkened. Although he was going to marry Lina in the future, he didn’t mind keeping that woman. After all, no one hated a beauty.

Qiao Nian sat in Gu Zhou’s car and turned to look out of the window, feeling a little uneasy.

Gu Zhou noticed Qiao Nian’s gaze. He reached out and held her hand, asking, “Are you very worried about her?”

Qiao Nian turned to look at Gu Zhou and nodded slightly. “She was injured because she took an arrow for me!”

After saying this, Qiao Nian felt her heart grow more and more flustered. The prince just now probably wanted to put on a show of saving a damsel in distress, but they had interrupted all of this. She felt that the prince would not let them go so easily.

Qiao Nian’s frown deepened. She had a nagging feeling that something else was about to happen.

Gu Zhou held Qiao Nian’s hand tightly and said softly, “Don’t worry, I’ve already gotten someone to inform Professor Ollie before I came. He’s already arranging the operating theater. My people have already sent the news of the Seventh Princess’s injury!”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she was a little surprised. She hadn’t expected Gu Zhou’s family to be able to hire Professor Ollie.

Professor Ollie was a world-renowned surgeon. He had already made full preparations before seeing Gu Zhou. He must have been worried that she would be injured, so he had invited Professor Ollie over.

Qiao Nian’s lips curved up slightly, and her eyes curved into crescents. The worry she had every day dissipated a little. She grabbed Gu Zhou’s hand and crossed her fingers. “Thank you.”

When Gu Zhou heard this, his eyebrows twitched slightly. “Huh?”

His voice was a little low and hoarse, with a hint of danger. He seemed to be very unhappy with Qiao Nian’s words.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion, not understanding why Gu Zhou was unhappy. She looked up at Gu Zhou and was about to ask him when she saw Gu Zhou’s handsome face growing larger and larger.

Their eyes met. She could see her face in Gu Zhou’s obsidian pupils.

Qiao Nian’s heart couldn’t help but race. She swallowed nervously. Just as she was about to say something, the man lowered his head and kissed her lips without hesitation.

The man kissed her hard on the lips before leaving reluctantly.

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s red and glossy lips. His eyes darkened as he pursed his lips slightly. Only then did he say in a hoarse voice, “You said the wrong thing.”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou and suddenly realized something.

Gu Zhou had never liked her saying “thank you” in the past.

“I—”

Qiao Nian had just said one word when the car stopped. They had already arrived at the hospital.

Qiao Nian looked out of the window and was about to get out of the car when she saw Chen Qing walking over.

Qiao Nian rolled down the car window. Chen Qing said with a pale face, “Second Young Master and Second Young Madam, something’s wrong.”

Hearing Chen Qing’s words, Qiao Nian felt uneasy. Her left eyelid twitched wildly as she asked, “Did something happen to Lina?”

Gu Zhou also frowned. Lina’s identity was special. If anything happened to her, it would be troublesome.

Chen Qing said, “When the Seventh Princess was undergoing surgery, she suddenly bled profusely and fainted!”
