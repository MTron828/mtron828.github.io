Chapter 195: Fetish

The officers had first arrived at the scene because someone had reported that someone had committed the crime of adultery. Hence, they didn’t pay too much attention to Su Xue and Qiu Nan’s injuries, and neglected to realize that a violent altercation must have taken place.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou with a strange light in her eyes, but that light quickly disappeared. She stood calmly at the side. She wanted to see how Qiao Yu would protect Qiao Shan.

A police officer walked up to Qiao Shan and said coldly, “Mr. Qiao, since you’ve already divorced Madam Su, then Madam Su has not committed the crime of adultery. However, it is against the law for you to hit Madam Su and her boyfriend. Please come with us.”

Qiao Shan gritted his teeth and glared at Su Xue. His gaze finally landed on the police officer’s face. He opened his mouth slightly, but he didn’t know how to explain himself. He was furious.

He was clearly the victim. He had been cheated on; it was him who should be pitied. It was only right for him to hit Su Xue and Qiu Nan. Why was he in the wrong now?

Su Xue, who was standing beside Qiao Xin, swayed on the spot, her heart in her throat. In that instant, she suddenly understood what Gu Zhou meant to do.

Gu Zhou was going to draw the line between her and Qiao Shan forever.

Qiao Shan was someone who cared about his reputation. How could he tolerate his wife having an affair? Beyond that, he still had to wear the label of a criminal who had committed intentional injury.

Gu Zhou’s casual words cut straight to the heart.

Qiao Yu stood there, pretending to be calm, but his mind was already in a mess. He narrowed his eyes and looked at Gu Zhou. He had never expected Gu Zhou to have considered every aspect of the matter.

Gu Zhou wanted his father and mother to never be together again!

Did Gu Zhou like Qiao Nian that much? Was he willing to help Qiao Nian take revenge on the Qiao family?

Qiao Nian stood at the side. Looking at Qiao Shan and Su Xue’s expressions, “”her lips curved up involuntarily.

It seemed that the show had just begun.

“No, this isn’t my fault.” Suppressing his anger, Qiao Shan enunciated each word clearly.

The other police officer took several photographs of the wounds on Qiu Nan and Su Xue’s faces before walking over to Qiao Shan. He said to the police officer next to Qiao Shan, “The evidence has been taken. After the doctor has examined their injuries, we can interrogate them.”

Su Xue’s heart was about to jump out of her throat. Her mind was racing. At this moment, her thoughts were crystal clear.

“Officer, that’s not what happened. The injuries on our faces were inflicted by ourselves. They have nothing to do with Qiao Shan. He didn’t hit anyone.” Running over to the police officer, Su Xue spoke impatiently.

When the police heard Su Xue’s words, they frowned. “Is that so? Did you make yourself look like this?”

Su Xue was slightly stunned. She quickly nodded and said, “Yes, I did it myself.”

The officer felt that Su Xue was insulting his intelligence. Su Xue’s injuries were very serious. How could she have made herself look like this? Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The police officer narrowed his eyes and stared at Su Xue’s face, scrutinizing her. He asked, “Alright, since you’ve said so, why don’t you tell me how the two of you got yourselves so badly injured?”

Su Xue was slightly stunned. She looked at Qiao Shan and saw him glaring at her angrily.

Su Xue knew very well that if she failed to protect Qiao Shan this time, the chances of her reconciling with him would be zero.

“I… I…” Su Xue’s mind was in a mess. Her gaze fell on Qiu Nan’s face, and her eyes flashed. She continued, “It’s Qiu Nan. It’s Qiu Nan. He has some odd fetishes. He’s into sadomasochism!”

When the policeman heard Su Xue’s words, a trace of surprise flashed in his eyes. In the end, he looked at Qiu Nan with disdain and asked sternly, “You must be Qiu Nan. Tell me, did you injure yourself? Do you have that kind of fetish?”
