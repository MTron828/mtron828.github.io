1391 Headache

“I’ve been searching, but I can’t find him,” Qiao Nian said in a low voice.

“Oh.” Qin Chuan suddenly thought of something and asked, “Did I help you look for him?”

“You’ve been looking for your grandfather as well.”

“Why has my grandfather gone missing too?” Qin Chuan asked, frowning.

Qiao Nian tried hard to remain calm and said, “Is there a possibility that your grandfather is our master?”

Qin Chuan looked at Qiao Nian. Although she looked calm, he could tell that she was impatient.

Could it be that he did not have a good relationship with his junior sister?

At the thought of this, Qin Chuan’s head began to hurt. His face suddenly turned pale, but the pain was still unbearable. He gripped the bedsheets under him tightly.

Qiao Nian noticed the change in Qin Chuan’s expression and hurriedly comforted him. “Qin Chuan, don’t try to think about the past. That way, it won’t hurt anymore.”

Qin Chuan heaved a sigh of relief and emptied his mind. The pain in his head gradually disappeared. He looked at Qiao Nian and met her concerned gaze. It seemed that his junior sister was still very concerned about him.

“Grandpa…” Qin Chuan asked uneasily.

“Don’t worry, Grandpa will definitely be blessed by the heavens. Our people are still looking for Grandpa. Everyone is waiting for you to recover.” Qiao Nian regretted telling Qin Chuan that his grandfather had gone missing just now. Otherwise, Qin Chuan wouldn’t have been so anxious.

Qin Chuan nodded slightly. His gaze couldn’t help but fall on the girl standing at the side.

At this moment, Song Yu’s phone rang. She took out her phone and glanced at the caller ID. Smiling at Qiao Nian and Qin Chuan, she said, “Sister and Mr. Qin, I have something on. I’ll go out and take a call.”

“Okay.” Qiao Nian smiled at Song Yu and nodded. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

After Song Yu left, Qin Chuan asked, “The person who just left was…”

“Her name is Song Yu, and she’s the sixth daughter of the Lu family.” Qiao Nian had a faint smile on her face as she spoke gently.

Qin Chuan lowered his gaze slightly.

Miss Lu.

Suddenly, an image flashed across his mind. He was sitting at the desk and writing non-stop. The words “Miss Lu” were written all over the white paper.

Qin Chuan’s heart skipped a beat. He couldn’t help but feel happy just because he heard the words “Miss Lu”.

Could it be that he was in a relationship with Miss Lu?

Qin Chuan remembered very clearly that when he woke up, he saw Song Yu’s innocent face. Her eyes were filled with joy.

She called him “Mr. Qin” because she was shy, or because he was her husband. Usually, she was too shy, so she only called him Mr. Qin.

“Qin Chuan, it’s possible that your current situation is because of the injury to the back of your head. There’s clotted blood pressing down on your nerves, which is why you lost your memory.” Qiao Nian’s words interrupted Qin Chuan’s thoughts. She paused for a moment and continued, “I just don’t know if you’ll lose your memory temporarily, or if you’ll never remember it.”

It would have been fine if Qin Chuan had only temporarily lost his memory. If he could not recover on his own, she would have to think of other ways to help him regain his memories. She hoped that the previous Qin Chuan would return.

Qin Chuan said seriously, “Shouldn’t you call me Senior?”

Qiao Nian’s expression froze. She looked at Qin Chuan in surprise.

Shouldn’t his focus be on whether he could regain his memories?

Why was his mind filled with other things?

Qiao Nian smiled helplessly and said, “Senior Brother, will that do?”

Qin Chuan’s lips curved up slightly. Looking at her bright smile, in a daze, he seemed to have seen the same smile before.

He gently raised his hand to rub her head, but just as he did so, an image of a young man gently rubbing the head of a young girl appeared in his mind. The smile on the young girl’s face gradually fused with Qiao Nian’s.

Just as Qin Chuan wanted to take a closer look, his brain began to hurt uncontrollably. He put down his hand, closed his eyes, and took a deep breath to empty his mind.

The pain in his brain gradually disappeared.

Qiao Nian stood up and walked over to Qin Chuan. In a low voice, she said, “Senior Brother, I’ll help you sit up now so that it’ll be easier to examine the injury to your brain.”
