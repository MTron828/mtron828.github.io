“Those people have already targeted your mother. Does that mean that they already know what we’re going to do?” Qiao Nian asked with a serious expression, frowning slightly.

“Yes, our movements are all under their control now. However, they don’t know the exact information we have now.” Gu Zhou sat lazily on the sofa, his brow slightly furrowed. His voice was as low as ever.

Qiao Nian played with the phone in her hand. She seemed to have thought of something and walked over to Gu Zhou. “I keep feeling that there’s a real traitor around us.”

“Everyone should know that we’ve come to Europe, but they don’t know why we’re here.” Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian and said, “Perhaps they’re just taking precautions.”

Qiao Nian reached out and took Gu Zhou’s arm. She leaned her head gently on his shoulder and said in a low voice, “I hope we can get to the bottom of everything this time.”

“We should be able to find out.”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she suddenly seemed to have thought of something. She looked at Gu Zhou and said, “My men just handed me the information. They said that the kidnapping more than twenty years ago might be related to the President of Europe.”

Gu Zhou sat up straight. “How accurate is the information?”

“Ninety percent.”

“If the President of the Europe did it, this matter will be troublesome.” Gu Zhou lowered his gaze, his expression serious.

“Actually, I don’t think it’s necessarily the President of Europe who did it.” Qiao Nian leaned on Gu Zhou’s shoulder again and said softly, “They just found out that it’s related to the President of Europe. Perhaps someone close to the President did it. We’re not sure about these things yet, but on the way back, I’ve already gotten someone to investigate the President of Europe. We found a lot of useful information.”

“What have you found?” Gu Zhou turned his head slightly and saw the delicate little face on his shoulder. He couldn’t help but kiss Qiao Nian’s forehead.

The tips of Qiao Nian’s ears were a little red. She looked at Gu Zhou and pretended to be serious. “I’m talking about serious matters with you.”

“I’m doing serious business too!”

Qiao Nian was speechless.

This was the first time she had realized that Gu Zhou was so eloquent. He was simply like Zhou Zhou. Every time, he would make her speechless.

Qiao Nian couldn’t be bothered to argue with Gu Zhou. She said seriously, “Back then, when I was kidnapped, the president of Europe wasn’t even the president. At that time, he was just a prince. At that time, he was by the side of the former president of Europe all day. Logically speaking, he didn’t have a child back then. Why would he kidnap me and ask me to donate my bone marrow to Song Man?”

“You’re right. Could Song Man be the illegitimate daughter of the president?” Gu Zhou asked, frowning slightly.

“I don’t think so. If Song Man is the illegitimate daughter of the President, how could the President bear to let her stay in the slums for so many years? No matter how poor the President of Europe is, it’s easy to raise a girl!” Qiao Nian thought of Lina’s bright little face again, and a bright smile appeared on her face. “Do you think Lina and Song Man look alike?” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“I don’t think so. Could it be someone close to the President of Europe?” Gu Zhou frowned slightly and said coldly.

“That’s possible.” After Qiao Nian finished speaking, she sat up straight and stared unblinkingly at Gu Zhou’s face. “But we can’t rule out the President of Europe. I heard that the President of Europe asked the police to stop investigating this incident. I’m wondering if he has other intentions. I’d better get close to Lina first. Perhaps I can get in touch with the President of Europe.”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he slowly lowered his gaze. It seemed that they would be staying in Europe for a long time.

At this moment, Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou’s phones rang. One of them took out his phone and saw that Xiao Shi had sent a voice message in the family group chat.

Qiao Nian clicked on the voice message.

Xiao Shi: “Daddy, Mommy, I miss you so much. Brothers miss you too!”

Hearing Xiao Shi’s soft voice coming from Qiao Nian’s phone, Gu Zhou’s lips curved up slightly. “We’ve only left for a while, and they already miss us. Why don’t we make a video call to them!”

“Yes!”
