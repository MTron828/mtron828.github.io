1096 Being Disturbed

Qiao Nian thought of Xiao Shi’s face. What she was most worried about now was that the child would live an aggrieved life like Xiao Shi. She only hoped that she could find that child as soon as possible and make it up to her child.

At this moment, there was a knock on the villa door.

Gu Zhou looked down at Qiao Nian, who was in his arms. When their eyes met, Gu Zhou said gently, “I’ll open the door.”

Qiao Nian nodded slightly, feeling a little puzzled.

!!

The Dongjiang villa was Gu Zhou’s private property. Typically, no one knew about the Dongjiang villa, nor did they know who was knocking on the door.

When Gu Zhou walked to the entrance of the courtyard, Qiao Nian was sitting on the sofa in the living room. She could see the situation clearly through the French windows.

When Gu Zhou opened the door, there was a huge creature standing at the door, like a huge potato.

Qiao Nian looked at the woman’s face and frowned.

Xu Qiu?

Why was this woman here?

She was quite bold. She actually followed them all the way from the Qiao family to the Dongjiang villa.

When Xu Qiu saw Gu Zhou, her eyes were red and swollen. Without another word, she knelt in front of Gu Zhou.

“Second Young Master Gu, we were in the wrong previously. We were blind. Please be magnanimous and don’t stoop to the level of country bumpkins like us. I beg you to let my man off,” Xu Qiu said tearfully. She kowtowed hard to Gu Zhou.

She initially thought that those people would just beat Shen Hao up. She had never expected them to take Shen Hao away!

Xu Qiu hated Shen Hao for finding a woman outside, but without Shen Hao, her family would be ruined.

Xu Qiu only hoped that Gu Zhou would let Shen Hao back.

Gu Zhou stood inside the house and looked down at Xu Qiu, who was kowtowing to him. He had no intention of stopping her.

Seeing Xu Qiu like this, Qiao Nian walked out.

Xu Qiu kowtowed so hard that her forehead was bleeding. However, she had heard from Su Xue about the Gu family and knew that the Gu family was not something small fries like her could afford to offend. Hence, she could only continue kowtowing.

She couldn’t help but see Qiao Nian. She looked at Qiao Nian with tears streaming down her face. Only then did she stop kowtowing and say tearfully, “Nian Nian, I beg you to let your uncle off. No matter what, our family has raised you. Just be a little magnanimous”

Qiao Nian sat leisurely on the swing in the courtyard. Her legs were swaying slightly in the air and she looked a little more playful.

She thought of her life in Shen Hao’s house and smiled coquettishly at Gu Zhou. “Hubby, did you notice that a fly has entered the house? The fly is so noisy and annoying!”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he looked at Xu Qiu coldly.

Xu Qiu sensed the coldness emanating from Gu Zhou and immediately trembled in fear. She swallowed nervously. Just as she was about to say something, she was silenced.

“You’re disturbing my wife!” Gu Zhou said impatiently.

Before Xu Qiu could react, Gu Zhou kicked her shoulder. She fell back uncontrollably and fell onto the road in a sorry state!

“Get lost!” With that, Gu Zhou closed the courtyard door mercilessly.

Qiao Nian really hadn’t expected Gu Zhou to kick her out. She silently gave Gu Zhou a thumbs up. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Gu Zhou was indeed Second Young Master Gu, who was a man of few words!

He was really too handsome!

Qiao Nian was leisurely swinging on the swing. Gu Zhou walked to her side, bent down, and picked her up in his arms. He walked towards the living room.

The cold aura around him had long disappeared. There was a smile on his face. When he placed Qiao Nian on the sofa, he looked at her gently, his eyes filled with an alluring smile. “Nian’er, what did you call me just now?”

Qiao Nian was stunned for a moment. She looked up at Gu Zhou. Had she just called him that?

Qiao Nian tried hard to recall what had just happened. Suddenly, the tips of her ears gradually turned red, and her face turned visibly red.

She had subconsciously called Gu Zhou “Hubby” just now. Now that she thought about it, she felt a little shy.

Silently, she looked away and said uncomfortably, “Nothing. I told you there were flies. It’s so noisy.”

“Is that so?” Gu Zhou moved closer to Qiao Nian, forcing her to look into his eyes. He could see the evasion in Qiao Nian’s eyes and knew that she had already recalled what had just happened. “Call me that again, okay?”
