1124 Ridiculous

Jiang Chi’s gaze landed on Lu Qi’s face behind Qin Chuan. He said seriously, “My brother has already said that if it’s a woman who can solve his ten questions, he wants to marry her!”

“This is really ridiculous!” Qin Chuan frowned and gripped his pistol tightly. He looked at Jiang Chi speechlessly. “Jiang Chi, is there something wrong with your brain? You clearly know that Jiang Cheng has already passed away. As his elder brother, you should let him rest in peace as soon as possible and reincarnate. What exactly are you doing here?”

Lu Qi, who was standing behind Qin Chuan, felt as if she had been struck by lightning when she heard Qin Chuan’s words. “Who did you just say?”

When Qin Chuan heard Lu Qi’s question, he turned to look at her and saw that her palm-sized face was pale. “Jiang Cheng!”

Lu Qi’s fox-like eyes instantly widened. She looked at Jiang Chi in shock. “You’re Brother Jiang Cheng’s brother?”

No wonder when she first saw Jiang Chi, she felt that he looked like Jiang Cheng. However, she didn’t think too much about it because Brother Jiang Cheng was already dead.

Jiang Cheng and Jiang Chi gave off a completely different feeling.

Jiang Cheng always had a gentle smile on his face and gave off a gentle feeling!

However, Jiang Chi was different. His eyes were sharp, and his lips were slightly pursed. He was extremely oppressive, as if a death god had arrived from hell!

She had heard Brother Jiang Cheng mention Jiang Chi before, but the Jiang Chi in front of her was completely different from the Jiang Chi in Brother Jiang Cheng’s eyes.

Jiang Chi couldn’t listen to Qin Chuan at all. He frowned and said impatiently, “Qin Chuan, I don’t want to see you now. I advise you to leave my sight as soon as possible!”

As Jiang Chi spoke, he glanced at the gun in his hand. His threat to Qin Chuan was obvious!

When Qin Chuan heard Jiang Chi’s words, he couldn’t help but laugh.

“If Brother Jiang Cheng is still alive, he definitely won’t want you to become like this!” Lu Qi said with a frown.

Jiang Chi’s gaze landed on Lu Qi’s face, and his eyes gradually darkened. “You Lu family members are really not qualified to speak!”

“Brother Jiang Cheng said that you’re a very gentle person.” Lu Qi stood side by side beside Qin Chuan, her hands clenched into fists. “Moreover, Brother Jiang Cheng isn’t someone who will make things difficult for others. He definitely doesn’t like what you’re doing now. I know that Brother Jiang Cheng met with an accident in An City. It was my brother who didn’t protect him well. If you really care about Brother Jiang Cheng, you should look for the culprit who killed him!”

“Are you teaching me how to do things?” Jiang Chi looked at Lu Qi sinisterly. “If your brother wasn’t incompetent, how could my brother have died? Your Lu family should pay with their lives!”

“What about the enemies who killed Brother Jiang Cheng?” Lu Qi had a stubborn temper to begin with. She frowned and looked at Jiang Chi. “All these years, my brother has been investigating their whereabouts, but there’s no news of them. What about you? Why didn’t you do anything? Or did you transfer your hatred to my brother before you found your enemy?” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Jiang Chi’s gaze grew colder and colder. He no longer wanted to argue with Lu Qi. His gaze fell on Qin Chuan’s face. “Qin Chuan, you should know my methods. It’s easy for me to kill someone. If you want to live, disappear from my sight immediately!”

Qin Chuan shielded Lu Qi behind him. His gaze turned sharp as he said coldly, “What a coincidence. It’ll be easy for me to kill you now!”

Jiang Chi and Qin Chuan both raised their pistols and aimed them at each other’s foreheads.

The other bodyguards in the private room took out their guns and aimed them at Qin Chuan and Lu Qi.

They were at each other’s throats, as if it would only take a small spark for the entire private room to explode.

At this moment, hurried footsteps came from outside the private room. The door of the private room was opened and a group of armed people entered. Those people were all pointing guns at Jiang Chi and his bodyguards.

Lu Qi looked at the clothes of those people and suddenly realized that they were mercenaries. It seemed that they were Qin Chuan’s men.

Seeing this, Jiang Chi’s bodyguards immediately surrounded him and shielded him with their bodies.

The mercenaries also walked in and surrounded Qin Chuan and Lu Qi, as if they wanted to use their bodies to block the bullets of Jiang Chi and the others.

At this moment, the atmosphere in the private room was exceptionally tense. No one dared to shoot!
