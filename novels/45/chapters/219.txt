Chapter 220: Impossible

With that, Qiao Nian turned and walked towards the kitchen.

Gu Zhou didn’t answer Qiao Nian, because he didn’t intend to eat any of the instant noodles at all. In his opinion, that kind of food wasn’t healthy, and it wouldn’t be good for him.

When Qiao Nian returned to the kitchen, she heaved a sigh of relief.

That was close. She had almost exposed her secret!

Fortunately, she had gone out to ask Chen Qing to get some laver just in time. Otherwise, her secret might have been discovered by Gu Zhou.

When Gu Zhou dialed the number again, a cold female voice came from the phone, indicating that the other party’s phone had been switched off.

Gu Zhou frowned and threw his phone onto the coffee table in frustration.

The first time he called, Qiao Nian’s phone rang. For a moment, he had thought that Qiao Nian was the former chairman of the Nianxing Corporation. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

However, when he thought about it carefully, he felt that it was impossible.

Previously, Qiao Nian had been locked up in the mental hospital by the Qiao family. It was possible for her to study medicine and cultivate medicinal herbs there, but it was unlikely for her to be able to run a company.

When Chen Qing came back in, he was holding some laver. He asked curiously, “Second Young Master, did the other party pick up the phone?”

Gu Zhou shook his head.

A trace of surprise flashed in Chen Qing’s eyes.

Someone out there had dared to ignore Master Gu’s call. How bold!

“Go and find out the identity of the SIM card,” Gu Zhou instructed indifferently.

Chen Qing hurriedly agreed, then silently ran to the kitchen. He didn’t want to suffer Master Gu’s oppressive aura in the living room.

After another five minutes, an alluring fragrance wafted out of the kitchen, lingering in the living room.

Gu Zhou turned to glance at the kitchen and frowned imperceptibly.

He had eaten many delicacies in his life, but he had never smelled anything so fragrant. It seemed to be a little sour, a little spicy, and contained some other indescribable flavors as well.

Gu Zhou was beginning to feel a little hungry.

After another five minutes, Chen Qing and Qiao Nian walked out of the kitchen with bowls of noodles.

Gu Zhou sensed that the aroma had intensified.

Qiao Nian placed a bowl of noodles on the table and took a deep breath. She looked at the noodles with satisfaction, then smiled at Gu Zhou. “Come and eat!”

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian’s satisfied expression. It was as if he was looking at a kitten who was washing its face happily after eating a bowl of fish. His gaze fell on the three bowls of noodles on the table.

These noodles smelled better than any he had ever eaten.

His throat worked.

Ever since Qiao Nian married into the Gu family, she had been eating delicacies every day. It had been a long time since she had eaten instant noodles. Her gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face and she smiled at him. “Come and taste it. If you leave it in the soup for too long, it won’t taste good anymore! If you really don’t think it tastes good, we can go back to the villa to eat something else.”

Instinctively, Gu Zhou was already rejecting the instant noodles. In his impression, instant noodles were not nutritious for the human body and should not be eaten.

However, the fragrance was simply too alluring. His body was no longer under his control. He walked to the bed and sat down.

Qiao Nian handed a pair of chopsticks to Gu Zhou and said with a smile, “Hurry up and try it. Tell me whether you think it tastes good!”

Gu Zhou took the chopsticks from Qiao Nian, watching as she sat down. With her chopsticks, she picked up a mouthful of instant noodles, then slurped it up forcefully.

Fragrant, spicy, savory, and sour. The combination of these flavors was simply amazing!

Satisfaction was written all over her face. She couldn’t help but say, “It’s delicious!”

Instant noodles were a magical food. If one ate too much of it, they would begin to feel that it tasted awful and would no longer want to eat it. However, if one went for a long time without eating it, one would be unable to resist once one smelled that distinctive fragrance.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian’s happy expression and frowned slightly. Whenever she ate at the Gu family villa, she had never looked so happy.

Moreover, Gu Zhou could sense that she was genuinely happy, not putting on an act.

Was Qiao Nian so easily satisfied?
