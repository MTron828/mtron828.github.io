Chapter 1790 - 1790 Surprise

However, the president’s body blocked Mark’s. Lina wanted to aim at Mark, but she was worried that her marksmanship was not good and she would hit the president.

Lina was a little annoyed. If she had worked hard to practice her shooting in the past, she would not miss. It was all her fault for being too relaxed in the past.

Lina originally wanted Chen Qing to shoot, but Chen Qing was now wrapped up by the enemy and could not get away. She did not have many bullets in her pistol, so she could only put it away.

In fact, when the president caught Mark’s knife just now, not only was Lina shocked, but others were also shocked.

The president was tall, but he was actually similar to Mark.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Mark’s face was filled with ferocity, especially since Mark was still fighting at the border. He exuded a domineering aura.

The president had a righteous look on his face. Coupled with the fact that he stayed in the palace all year round, his skin was fairer than Mark’s, and he looked a little cultured, so everyone thought that the president did not know how to fight.

The President looked coldly at Mark in front of him. His blue eyes narrowed slightly as he said word by word, “Mark, I think you’ve forgotten something.”

Mark’s hand holding the long knife froze slightly as his gaze fell on the president’s face.

The President’s thin lips curled up coldly and he said, “We used to learn this from Master. At that time, Master felt that I was more talented than you in this aspect.”

Everyone only saw the President move the blade slightly, and the originally trembling blade immediately became indestructible.

The next moment, under everyone’s surprised gazes, the president raised his hand. The long knife in his hand cut open the big knife in Mark’s hand. Under Mark’s surprised gaze, he attacked without hesitation.

Everyone around them was stunned. Some of them were distracted as they fought their opponents. Most of their attentions were on the president and Mark.

However, everyone did not expect that not only could the president use the long saber skillfully, but he was also very familiar with every move, as if he practiced it every day.

In the next few minutes, the president and Mark fought back and forth. For a moment, it was impossible to determine the winner.

Seeing the President like this, Qiao Nian immediately dealt with an enemy who wanted to ambush her and defeated him. She took the opportunity to step on the enemy and said to Gu Zhou beside her, “I didn’t expect the President to hide his strength so well. His moves are very precise. Every move is used very well, forcing Mark to lose the initiative to attack. He can only keep defending.”

Gu Zhou kicked horizontally, sending the enemy who had launched a sneak attack flying. His eyes were calm as he said, “You’re right. However, although the president seems to have the upper hand, that’s not the case.”

Qiao Nian glanced at Gu Zhou and frowned slightly. When she looked at the president again, she realized that when Mark’s moves were flawed, his eyes flickered with a ferocious glint. He counterattacked without hesitation and directly gained the upper hand.

The knife in Mark’s hand was cold as he went into attack mode. He slashed at the president ruthlessly, as if he wanted to vent all his anger over the years.

Mark thought of those things in the past, and his grip became stronger. “Remember when we were young? What goes around comes around. Why are you still living in the past?”

“For so many years, you’ve been sitting in the president’s seat and living a carefree life. Your skills have long deteriorated. You’re not me. I’ve been fighting in the frontlines.” Mark slashed hard at the president, the anger in his eyes increasing. “You’ve stopped moving forward long ago. And I’ve been training and killing for so many years. I’ve been improving. You’re no match for me at all!”

Over the years, Mark had gone through hell and back. His entire body was emitting hostility, scaring the people around him.

However, Mark was wrong about one thing. It was not that there was no one else around the president. Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian had already rushed over.

Gu Zhou took out the long knife in his hand and looked at Mark coldly.
