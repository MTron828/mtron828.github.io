1108 Where are our younger brothers and sisters?

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian made a concrete plan to find their child. After drinking coffee, the two of them left the cafe.

Holding Qiao Nian’s hand, Gu Zhou walked towards the parking lot. Qiao Nian turned to look at Gu Zhou and said with a smile, “We’ve neglected the children for the past two days. I miss them too. Let’s go home and visit Xiao Qi and Xiao Shi now!”

“Okay.”

Gu Zhou parked the car at the entrance of the Gu family villa. He got out of the car first. Seeing Qiao Nian get out of the car, he walked over to her and reached out to hold her hand.

Qiao Nian immediately retracted her hand. A gentle smile appeared on her face as she said, “Don’t be like this. If the children see this, I’ll be embarrassed!”

Gu Zhou was speechless.

If he hadn’t missed his children, he would never have brought Qiao Nian home!

When the two of them walked into the living room, Xiao Shi and Xiao Qi were playing games on their phones!

When Xiao Shi saw that Qiao Nian had returned, she immediately threw the phone to Xiao Qi. Without hesitation, she threw herself into Qiao Nian’s arms and called out sweetly, “Mommy!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Qiao Nian bent down and picked Xiao Shi up with a smile. She kissed Xiao Shi’s cheek and asked with a smile, “Baby, were you obedient at home? Did you listen to Grandma?”

Xiao Shi’s face was flushed red. She hadn’t expected her mommy to kiss her face. Her kiss was reciprocated. She moved closer to Qiao Nian’s face and kissed her lightly. “Xiao Shi and Brother were both very obedient at home. Grandma said that Daddy and Mommy have to work hard to give birth to our younger siblings. Of course, Brother and I were very obedient! Xiao Shi was also very obedient in school. The teacher even sent me a little red flower yesterday as a reward!”

After Xiao Shi finished speaking, she tilted her head and glanced at Gu Zhou, who was behind Qiao Nian. “Hello, Daddy!”

Gu Qi stood up and walked up to Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou. “Mommy and Dad!”

Gu Zhou bent down and picked Gu Qi up. Looking at Gu Qi and Xiao Shi’s young faces, he couldn’t help but be even more worried about the child he hadn’t found. He wondered if that child was doing well!

Xiao Shi glanced around Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou and frowned in confusion. She tilted her head and asked in confusion, “Daddy and Mommy, where are our younger brothers and sisters?”

Qiao Nian was stunned.

Gu Zhou was speechless.

“What are you talking about?” Qiao Nian smiled and scratched Xiao Shi’s nose affectionately, asking dotingly.

“Grandma said that Daddy and Mommy had gone to give birth to a younger brother and sister. She told Brother and me to be good because we’re already big children!”

A trace of worry flashed across Qiao Nian’s face. She recalled that she hadn’t found her child, but it wasn’t appropriate for her to tell Xiao Shi and Gu Qi about this. “After some time, you might have a younger brother or sister!”

Xiao Shi smiled until her eyes curved into crescents. She nodded vigorously. “Alright, then I’ll be an older sister. I’ll definitely take good care of my younger siblings!”

“I believe that Xiao Shi must be the best sister in the world.” As Qiao Nian spoke, she lowered her head and planted a kiss on Xiao Shi’s forehead. “Xiao Qi, what has Xiao Shi been studying in school recently? Can you tell Mommy?”

When Gu Qi heard Xiao Shi’s words, although there was no other expression on his small face, his red ears meant that he was already starting to feel shy.

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian followed Gu Qi and Xiao Shi to their study. Gu Qi and Xiao Shi took out their biology textbooks and handed them to Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou.

When Qiao Nian saw the biology textbook, she was slightly stunned. She had only studied biology in junior high in the past, but kindergarteners had already begun to study biology. Were kindergarteners all so studious?

“Did you have a biology class?” Qiao Nian couldn’t help but ask.

Gu Qi shook his head and said seriously, “No, my sister and I were very curious about where we came from. Then, the teacher recommended that we look at the biology textbook. We finished looking at the biology textbook, but we still don’t understand where we came from.”

Xiao Shi nodded seriously and said in agreement, “Yes, yes. Xiao Shi doesn’t understand either. In the past, my neighbors told me that I was picked up from the trash!”
