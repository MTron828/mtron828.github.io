1334 Worry

Before the security officer could reach the security officer booth, he heard Lu Zhu’s cold voice. He was so frightened that he fell.

The Lu family?

Was that the eldest daughter of the Lu family outside just now?

The security officer took out his phone. He was about to call Bai Hui to ask, but when he thought about how Bai Hui didn’t like to be disturbed during class, he could only call Yu Chu.

Yu Chu was writing a thesis when she heard the security officer’s words. When she received the call, she said in surprise, “Are you saying that Second Sister-in-law is here?”

The security officer said shakily, “Yes, Madam Qiao is at the door now. She said that she wanted to take Little Master and Little Miss away.”

Before Yu Chu could speak, she heard the security officer say, “Just now, Madam Qiao and Mr. Lu said that if we didn’t open the door, they would blow up the door. They even said that Madam Bai would never be able to appear in the country.”

When Yu Chu heard the security officer’s words, her expression changed slightly. She recalled what her teacher had done previously and felt very helpless.

She knew that Brother Ah Zhou and Second Sister-in-law would definitely be angry that her teacher had brought the children over, but she was a nobody. The teacher did not listen to her at all and insisted on doing things her own way.

Teacher’s actions would only make Brother Ah Zhou and Second Sister-in-law bear a grudge against her.

Yu Chu sighed and said, “Invite them in now. I’ll go look for Teacher.”

After Yu Chu hung up, she slowly closed her eyes, feeling a deep sense of powerlessness. She didn’t understand why her teacher insisted on making things difficult for Second Sister-in-law.

Second Sister-in-law and Brother Ah Zhou were clearly a match made in heaven.

Moreover, Second Sister-in-law had already given birth to two children for Brother Ah Zhou. If her teacher went against them, wouldn’t she make things difficult for Brother Ah Zhou and the two children?

Yu Chu stood up and walked to the door of Bai Hui’s classroom. This was the villa area, and this was a classroom where a teacher had a class. Students cane here for class.

She walked to the classroom door. Hesitatingly, she looked through the window and saw her teacher standing at the podium, as gentle as water.

In a daze, Yu Chu recalled how Bai Hui had treated Brother Ah Zhou. She didn’t understand. Teacher was clearly so gentle, but why was she so strict with Brother Ah Zhou?

Before Yu Chu could knock, Bai Hui saw Yu Chu. She frowned imperceptibly, then smiled at the students. “You guys read first. I have something to do outside.”

With that, Bai Hui walked out. When she saw Yu Chu, her expression instantly darkened. She asked sternly, “I’ve said it many times in the past. Don’t disturb my class!”

Yu Chu lowered her head and said guiltily, “Teacher, I’m sorry for disturbing your class. There’s something very important.”

“Yes?” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Second Sister-in-law is here to pick up her children,” Yu Chu said truthfully.

When Bai Hui heard “Second Sister-in-law”, she frowned and asked unhappily, “Second Sister-in-law?”

Yu Chu felt the cold aura emanating from Bai Hui and clenched her fists nervously.

Her teacher was angry.

Every time she called Qiao Nian “Second Sister-in-law”, her teacher would get angry. She didn’t understand why her teacher insisted on falling out with her family. It was clearly so good to have a family.

“Did you let her in?”

Yu Chu lowered her gaze and replied in a low voice, “Yes.”

“You clearly know that I would not allow her to come in. Why did you have to disobey my orders!” Bai Hui’s expression darkened as she questioned coldly.

Perhaps it was because Bai Hui’s voice was too loud, but it attracted the attention of the students in the classroom. One by one, they looked out curiously.

Bai Hui sensed the students’ gazes and looked at Yu Chu coldly. “Come with me!”

Yu Chu lowered her head and followed Bai Hui.

“Teacher.” Yu Chu mustered her courage and looked up at Bai Hui, her voice trembling. “You clearly care a lot about Brother Ah Yue and Brother Ah Zhou. Shouldn’t you treat them well? Second Sister-in-law is already with Brother Ah Zhou. Why do you have to object? What’s wrong with Second Sister-in-law?”

“As long as she’s from the Lu family, she can’t be with him!” Bai Hui said through gritted teeth.

“Teacher.” Yu Chu looked at Bai Hui sadly and said softly, “But Brother Ah Zhou likes Second Sister-in-law, and so do the children. Why can’t you consider Brother Ah Zhou and the children? Why…”
