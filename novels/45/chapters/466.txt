Chapter 467: My Woman

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Gu Zhou couldn’t even be bothered to look at Jiang Chi. He said calmly, “If you want revenge, I won’t stop you. However, I owe Lu Zhu a favor. Let’s rely on our own abilities!”

Jiang Wen was stunned. He had never expected such an unreasonable person to exist in this world.

Jiang Wen thought of Qiao Nian again. At that time, Qiao Nian had also entered with a nuclear bomb tied to her. Her actions were exactly the same as Gu Zhou’s.

“By the way,” Gu Zhou’s gaze landed on Jiang Chi’s face as he said calmly, “Mr. Jiang, I forgot to introduce you. Qiao Nian is my woman. If she suffers any harm in your Ghost City, it doesn’t matter if there are thousands of Ghost Cities. I can still set off fireworks!”

Chen Qing was speechless.

Oh my god!

Second Young Master had finally made an official announcement!

Second Young Master was so angry that he was unwilling to even address her respectfully. He was so crude.

This was the first time Chen Qing had seen Second Young Master like this.

Of course, it wasn’t just Jiang Chi and Jiang Wen who were stunned. Chen Shi and Qin Chuan’s subordinates were also stunned.

Gu Zhou stared at Jiang Chi’s face and saw the strange expression on his face. He knew Jiang Chi very well.

It must be because Jiang Chi had developed different feelings for Qiao Nian that he had unreasonably detained her.

Gu Zhou did not like Jiang Chi’s gaze because he was eyeing his woman covetously.

He wanted to nip that little spark in Jiang Chi’s heart in the bud.

Although Qiao Nian was his wife in name, he wouldn’t allow any man to have improper thoughts about his wife.

Gu Zhou touched the ring on his hand impatiently and sighed, not having any patience at all.

“Mr. Jiang, are you letting her go now?”

Gu Zhou’s voice sounded much gentler than before. This was him showing respect for Jiang Chi.

No matter what, Jiang Chi had once saved his big brother, which was why he had used diplomacy before violence. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have had the time to talk nonsense with him.

Jiang Chi’s gaze landed on Gu Zhou’s face. For some reason, he recalled Gu Yue, who had once fought with him in MY!

At that time, Gu Yue was also so high-spirited and fearless.

Even if there was artillery fire, oil pots, or mountains of knives and seas of fire ahead, he would step in without hesitation or a frown.

Jiang Chi recalled what Qiao Nian had said to him when he left.

He now completely understood that the person Qiao Nian was worried about was Gu Zhou.

But how could someone like Gu Zhou make his woman worry about him?

Qiao Nian’s words echoed in his ears. Jiang Chi’s blue eyes narrowed slightly. He turned to look at the mercenary behind him and said, “Let them go!”

When Jiang Wen heard Jiang Chi say this, he was stunned. His eyes couldn’t help but widen. He hurriedly reminded, “Master Jiang, if we let Lu Zhu go now, I’m afraid we won’t have the chance to catch him again!”

“Let them go!”

Jiang Wen’s heart instantly turned cold. He looked into Jiang Chi’s cold eyes and knew that he had already made a decision. No matter what he said, it was useless.

Besides, Jiang Wen’s gaze landed on Gu Zhou’s face.

Gu Zhou was exactly the same as Gu Yue back then.

If they did not release him, Gu Zhou would definitely bomb the Ghost City.

If the ghost city was gone, Second Young Master’s soul might not be able to find its way home.

At the thought of this, Jiang Wen could only endure it. He said weakly to the mercenary, “Bring them all over!”

“Yes!”

Chen Qing stood at the side and secretly heaved a sigh of relief. Second Madam was finally saved, and CEO Lu was fine. That was great.

Gu Zhou’s gaze landed on Jiang Chi’s face. After a while, he said calmly, “Thank you!”

Gu Zhou knew in his heart that ever since Jiang Chi had entered the martial world, he had probably never suffered a setback.

Although it seemed that he had the upper hand now, as long as Jiang Chi changed his words, it would be very difficult for Qiao Nian and Lu Zhu to come out alive. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Before coming here, Gu Zhou was already prepared to die with them.

He thought that if Qiao Nian and Lu Zhu didn’t come out, he would definitely make Jiang Chi regret it.

Now it seemed that was the best solution.
