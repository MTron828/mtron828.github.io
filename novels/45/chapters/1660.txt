Chapter 1661 Splashing Water

When Wright heard Lina's words, a trace of surprise flashed in his eyes. He had never expected Lina to say such a thing. His eyes gradually turned cold as he said coldly, "You're no longer like the old you."

"I don't think you've ever seen the real me." Lina gave an elegant smile and slowly sat down on a chair. She looked at the large mirror in front of her and saw Wright's ferocious face in it. She said calmly, "Or do you want me to take off the friendly masks you and your father have been wearing for years?"

Wright's gaze lingered on Lina's face, and his eyes gradually darkened. He couldn't touch Lina anymore.

Wright walked towards Lina step by step. His lips curved up slightly as he said softly, "I think no one will mind if I have sex with my fiancée in advance!"

Lina raised her hand to slap Wright, but Wright grabbed her hand.

Qiao Nian walked in with the headdress. This was a custom-made headdress that Lina had specially made. When she saw that Wright was about to bully Lina, her expression changed. She placed the headdress on the table at the side, picked up the teapot on the table, and splashed the water at Wright.

"Wow!"

Wright's hair, which had been neatly combed, was drenched in water. There were still tea leaves on his face. He looked at Qiao Nian not far away with a malicious expression. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Nian noticed Wright's gaze and pretended to be shocked. She covered her mouth and said, "Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. I thought a beast was going to bully the Seventh Princess. After all, today is the Seventh Princess's auspicious day. There are always some people who can't control their lower bodies. I never expected it to be you. You're indeed pretentious. You almost did what a beast would do."

The panic in Lina's heart gradually disappeared. Her gaze fell on Qiao Nian's face, and her eyes were filled with laughter.

Wright was so angry that he was panting heavily. He looked at Qiao Nian coldly, pursed his lips, and said angrily, "Miss Qiao, aren't you afraid that I'll get someone to arrest you?"

The smile on Qiao Nian's face grew brighter. She said softly, "Then call someone over. I'm the bridesmaid. Without a bridesmaid. I'm afraid this engagement banquet will be postponed."

Wright took a deep breath and pointed at Qiao Nian's face. With a complicated expression, he said, "Alright, alright. You're right. You want to take the opportunity to postpone it. Let me tell you, stop dreaming. The engagement banquet has to be held as scheduled!"

After Wright said his piece, he turned around and walked out.

After Wright left, Qiao Nian looked at Lina worriedly and asked anxiously, "How are you? Are you injured? By the way, he didn't do anything overboard, did he?"

When Lina heard Qiao Nian's words, her heart warmed. She shook her head and said in a low voice, "No, he was almost angered to death by me just now."

When Qiao Nian heard Lina's words, she gave a relaxed smile. "That's good. You have to take good care of yourself. Don't be bullied."

As she spoke, Qiao Nian reached out and hugged Lina. Although Lina couldn't see, her eyes were filled with worry.

Before Lina married Wright, Wright had already revealed his true colors. He was so rough with Lina. She wondered what else Wright would do after the engagement.

Recalling Wright's defeated expression just now, Lina smiled and comforted Qiao Nian. "Don't worry, I'm a princess. If he really dares to bully me, I'll pretend to be pitiful. I can be shameless, but they can't."

Qiao Nian knew that Lina wanted to use the power of public opinion, but this wouldn't be good for her reputation.

The president and Lina were now in a weak position. They really did not have the ability to fight back.

Sigh.

Qiao Nian sighed silently in her heart. The kind and adorable Lina couldn't marry the person she liked.

Suppressing the sadness in her heart, Qiao Nian helped Lina sit on a chair and said with a smile, "I've brought the headdress you wanted. I can put it on for you to see."

When Lina heard Qiao Nian's words, she smiled and nodded. "Okay."

She recalled what Wright had told her previously. Her eyes darted around and she asked hesitantly, "Nian Nian, are there many people attending the engagement banquet today?"
