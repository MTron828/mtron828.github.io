Chapter 359: Madness

One had to know that this painting was the most perfect work of the famous painter, Mr. Huang Shi. This painting had a profound impact. It reflected a desire to break the feudal divine power, to break the feudalism of asceticism, and to break the spiritual and physical blockade of the feudal system.

This painting was priceless.

“Miss Song is simply too outstanding!”

“Miss Song is indeed beautiful and kind. In order to let the children in the poor mountains study, she actually took out this painting!”

“I have to get this painting today. This trip won’t be wasted.”

“This painting is mine. I want to get it too.”

…

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Song Yu. Her beautiful fox-like eyes narrowed slightly.

At this moment, Zhang Lei, who was standing on the stage, shouted, “70 million!”

When everyone heard this number, they were all stunned.

What?

Only 70 million?

Could it be that this price was not wrong?

......

One had to know that the stone wall painting was a priceless treasure in the eyes of the world.

Everyone wanted to bid for this painting.

At this moment, someone shouted.

“80 million!”

Everyone turned to look. So the bidder was Li Kun.

Thinking about it, the Li family valued art collecting. How could he let go of such a representative painting?

“80 million!”

“One hundred million!” Gu Zhou said indifferently.

Hearing Gu Zhou’s voice, Song Yu was slightly stunned. She turned to look at Gu Zhou. If she had known that Brother Gu Zhou liked this painting, she would have given it to him long ago.

Qiao Nian was also stunned, but on second thought, it was normal. There were many famous paintings hanging in Gu Zhou’s study. It seemed that Gu Zhou really liked to collect paintings. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

At this moment, a cold voice rang out from the side. “110 million!”

Everyone turned to look.

“I think it’s Qiao Yu!”

“What do you mean by that? It’s clearly Qiao Yu!”

“Although the Qiao family isn’t well-known, Qiao Yu is one of the best among his peers!”

“So Qiao Yu’s future will be bright!”

“It seems that under Qiao Yu’s leadership, the Qiao family’s medical company has made a lot of money!”

…

In front of everyone, Qiao Xin held onto Qiao Yu’s arm arrogantly and walked to the front.

Qiao Yu was wearing a black suit as usual, looking a little old-fashioned. He had a pair of black-framed glasses on his nose, and looked very shrewd.

His gaze swept across the banquet hall, finally landing on Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian looked away indifferently, feeling a little puzzled.

Why had Qin Chuan invited him?

Today, Qiao Xin had also dressed up meticulously. She was wearing a long white dress. She walked up to Qiao Nian and gave her a sweet smile. “Sister!”

In the eyes of outsiders, Qiao Xin looked like a close sister.

Qiao Nian sensed a change in Qiao Xin. It was as if Qiao Xin had already forgotten about her dealing with Su Xue.

Gu Zhou said indifferently, “Two hundred million!”

Qiao Yu’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face, looking determined to win. “Three hundred million!”

“Five hundred million!” Gu Zhou said.

Zhang Lei, who was standing on the stage, could no longer remain calm.

Qiao Nian frowned slightly, her gaze falling on the painting. She didn’t understand. Was this painting really that valuable?

Why would Gu Zhou take a liking to this painting?

This was the first time she had seen Gu Zhou so crazy.

At this moment, Song Yu was also a little surprised. Although this painting was rare, the price was a little too high!

“Six hundred million!” Qiao Yu shouted.

When Qiao Xin heard Qiao Yu call her that, her heart skipped a beat.

What was her brother doing?

Why would he spend six hundred million on a painting?

Her brother was a painter himself. Moreover, his paintings were difficult to buy in the market.

Could there be something special about this painting on the stage?
