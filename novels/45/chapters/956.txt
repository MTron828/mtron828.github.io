957 Are you hungry?

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s voice, his heart ached for her. He moved slightly closer to her and buried his head in her neck.

Smelling the fragrance of Qiao Nian’s hair, Gu Zhou’s heart ached. “I just arrived.”

Sensing Gu Zhou’s small actions, Qiao Nian’s body stiffened slightly. She tried hard to remain calm. Gu Zhou’s voice was different from the one she had heard in her dream. Gu Zhou probably didn’t speak to her.

However, when she woke up, she heard Gu Zhou apologize.

Qiao Nian’s heart seemed to have been struck by something. Her eyes were a little hot.

Actually, all these years, she didn’t want that person to marry her. She wanted that person to apologize to her.

She could understand that man. That man had no choice.

Although the man was drugged at that time, he already controlled himself to the best of his ability and was very gentle to her. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

However, after she woke up that day, the man had disappeared.

She used all her strength but could not find that man. That man seemed to have appeared out of thin air.

Hence, at that time, she was very angry. She yearned to kill that man.

If it weren’t for that man, how could her life be so tainted?

However, the dream just now had also reminded her of many things.

She recalled her pregnancy.

When she first realized that she was pregnant, her first reaction was to hate the child in her stomach, because the child in her stomach was a stain on her life.

If the child was born, this stain on her life would never be cleared.

Hence, she did not want to give birth.

However, Qiao Nian knew very well that her physique wasn’t good. If she underwent an abortion this time, she might never be able to get pregnant again.

Qiao Nian thought for a long time. In the end, she decided to give birth.

She was not a gambler. She liked a stable life.

Moreover, the child in her stomach was innocent. She was strong enough to raise her children and let them receive a better education.

She had not expected so many things to happen after that. After going around in circles, she found out who that man was back then because of her children.

She had always wanted to find out who that man was, but she hadn’t expected him to hide what had happened that night in order to protect her.

She and Gu Zhou were both right.

They all wanted to protect her.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian in front of him. Although he was hugging her, he felt that she was very far away.

He held Qiao Nian’s hand tightly and asked softly, “Are you hungry?”

Qiao Nian retracted her thoughts and turned her head slightly. “A little!”

Gu Zhou let go of Qiao Nian and sat up. He looked at Qiao Nian. “Then wash up. We’ll go out to eat!”

Qiao Nian didn’t think too much about it and stood up.

She packed up very quickly. She was naturally beautiful.

She and Gu Zhou walked downstairs. Neither of them noticed the people in the dining room.

At this moment, in the dining room, Gu Qi and Xiao Shi were staring unblinkingly in the direction Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian had left in. Their eyes were filled with stars.

Matriarch Gu sat at the side, a gentle smile on her face. She looked at Qiao Nian worriedly, hoping that Qiao Nian would stay in the Gu family.

Matriarch Gu did not know the details yet. She vaguely knew that Gu Zhou had left the twins behind that night.

She had always thought that Qiao Nian would despise Gu Zhou for having twins.

The servant came out with the food and happened to see Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian leaving. Just as she was about to call for them, Gu Qi and Xiao Shi each grabbed her arm.

“Auntie Wang, I’m starving. Can you help me bring the rice over?” Xiao Shi said coquettishly.

When the servant heard Xiao Shi’s words, she nodded. “Okay, Young Miss!”

Gu Qi looked at the servant and said, “I want rice too!”

The servant nodded and turned to walk into the kitchen. When she came out again, she realized that Second Young Master and Second Young Madam had already driven away from the Gu family villa through the French windows in the distance.

Only then did the servant realize that Young Miss and Young Master had wanted Second Young Master and Second Young Madam to be alone.

She couldn’t help but laugh. These two children were so adorable!
