1389 Why isn’t he awake?

The sun was setting.

In Qin Chuan’s ward.

Qiao Nian came out of the bathroom of the ward and her gaze fell on Lu Qi’s face. Ever since Qin Chuan had been sent to the ward, Lu Qi had been guarding Qin Chuan’s bed and staring at his face.

Qiao Nian’s eyes were filled with confusion. She slowly walked to the sofa and sat down, frowning. Something didn’t seem right with Qi Qi.

She glanced at the unconscious Qin Chuan and said, “Qi Qi, you haven’t recovered yet. Do you want to rest first? I’ll call you when Qin Chuan wakes up.”

Lu Qi shook her head stubbornly. Reluctantly, she shifted her gaze from Qin Chuan’s face to Qiao Nian’s and asked, “Sister, why isn’t Senior Brother awake yet?”

She sounded a little down, as if she was very sad.

Qiao Nian stood up and walked over to Lu Qi. She gently patted Lu Qi’s shoulder and comforted her gently. “He was injured today and underwent surgery. He will be sleeping now. He’s recuperating. Only then can he recover faster.”

Lu Qi knew in her heart that Qiao Nian was right, but she couldn’t help but feel nervous. Her gaze fell on Qin Chuan’s face again.

When she thought of how her senior brother had risked everything to protect her in the tunnel, she only wanted to see him when he woke up.

But for some reason, Lu Qi felt an emptiness in her heart, as if something was missing.

At this moment, there was a knock on the ward door.

“Come in,” Qiao Nian said.

Song Yu pushed the door open and walked in. She smiled at Lu Qi and said gently, “Qi Qi, I’ll stay in the hospital with you tonight.”

Song Yu was still holding six thermos boxes. She smiled and said, “People are made of steel. If you want to wait for Mr. Qin to wake up, you have to eat. Otherwise, you won’t be able to hold on.”

“Sister Song Yu, I’m not hungry,” Lu Qi said weakly. She looked at Song Yu and was about to say something when her vision suddenly darkened and she lost consciousness.

Qiao Nian quickly supported Lu Qi and called out worriedly, “Qi Qi!”

Song Yu quickly walked over and helped Qiao Nian support Lu Qi. Frowning, she said, “Qi Qi has been stubborn since she was young. Sister, quickly see if she’s fine.”

“I’ll send her to the ward first, but…” As Qiao Nian spoke, she looked at the unconscious Qin Chuan worriedly.

Song Yu noticed Qiao Nian’s gaze and hurriedly said, “Sister, I’ll stay here and take care of Mr. Qin.”

Qiao Nian smiled and nodded. “I have to trouble you then.”

“We’re all family.” Song Yu smiled.

Qiao Nian bent down and picked Lu Qi up horizontally. Only then did she realize that Lu Qi was very thin and light.

Song Yu hurriedly ran to the door and opened it for Qiao Nian. After Qiao Nian left with Lu Qi in her arms, she placed the lunch box on the bedside table. She walked to Qin Chuan’s bed and sat down, taking out her phone to play games.

She was the spokesperson of the game, so she had to practice more in the game.

While opening the game, she inadvertently glanced at Qin Chuan, who was lying on the hospital bed, and her eyes lit up. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Although Qin Chuan looked sickly, his facial features were outstanding. He was much better-looking than the male celebrities in the entertainment industry and was about the same as her brothers in the Lu family.

At this moment, Qin Chuan’s eyelashes trembled slightly.

Song Yu thought that she had seen something wrong. She leaned closer and realized that Qin Chuan had already opened his eyes.

“Mr. Qin, you’re awake. How do you feel now?” Song Yu asked politely. Seeing that Qin Chuan still wanted to sit up, she hurriedly said, “Mr. Qin, lie back down quickly. You haven’t recovered yet. If you move around, your injuries might worsen.”

Qin Chuan lay on the bed and met Song Yu’s concerned eyes. Just as he was about to speak, his brain instantly hurt.

His mind was empty. Everything around him was very unfamiliar to him. His gaze finally landed on Song Yu’s face. Thinking of what he had just said, he asked, “What’s wrong with me?”

Song Yu looked at Qin Chuan in confusion and explained, “When the tunnel collapsed, you were injured, so you were sent to the hospital.”
