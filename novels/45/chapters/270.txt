Chapter 271: Counterattack

When Lu Nian heard Lu Zhu’s words, he frowned. His tone was filled with helplessness. “Brother, she’s already dead. You’re digging your own grave. You should put her down and move on!”

“Then can you let her go?”

Hearing Lu Zhu’s question, Lu Nian’s breathing hitched. His gaze fell on the blue sky and white clouds outside the window. In a daze, he seemed to see his sister smiling sweetly and calling him brother.

His sister was truly adorable.

Lu Nian slowly closed his eyes. He suppressed these memories to the bottom of his heart.

“I don’t remember her anymore,” Lu Nian said coldly.

“Alright, in that case, I’ll take the photo of your sister from your bedside table.”

When Lu Nian heard Lu Zhu’s words, he frowned and said resignedly, “You’re not allowed to touch my things!”

When Lu Zhu heard Lu Nian’s words, he understood. He asked, “Will you come back next year on the anniversary of your sister’s death?”

Lu Nian: Was he being threatened?

“Alright, I’ll take it away now,” Lu Zhu said bluntly.

“Yes!” Lu Nian said through gritted teeth. He regretted not carrying his sister’s photo with him.

“Qi Qi has been talking about you a lot lately. She spends all her time in the kitchen, saying that she wants to learn how to cook. She’ll cook for you when you get home!”

When Lu Nian thought of Lu Qi’s dark dishes, his eyes were filled with disdain. “Then I won’t go back!”

“How dare you!”

“I’m not eating it anyway. If you like it, you can have it.” With that, Lu Nian hung up without hesitation.

After hanging up, Lu Nian felt as if all his strength had been drained. He had wanted to persuade Lu Zhu to walk out of his sister’s death, but he was turned around.

Annoyed, Lu Nian called Brother Cao.

“Brother Cao, go to the school and take a look. How’s that woman’s training going?”

When Brother Cao heard Lu Nian’s words, his eyes widened.

That woman?

What?

His Mr. Dong Hua was a refined and polite young master. How had he become like this?

“Okay.” What troubled Brother Cao the most was that he had just come to an agreement with Xia Xue this morning. Why was he inspecting Xia Xue now? It had only been a few hours, and he was inspecting Xia Xue. Was that not a good idea? However, he did not want to say anything more to the angry Lu Nian.

“Help me observe someone.”

Hearing Lu Nian’s words, Brother Cao’s eyes lit up. Did Lu Nian have someone he liked? “Who is it?”

“Qiao Nian.”

“Who is she? Why are you thinking of her? Or have you taken a liking to her?” Brother Cao asked.

“You don’t have to know. Just do as I say,” Lu Nian said impatiently.

“Okay.” Brother Cao felt that he had vaguely guessed the truth.

Qiao Nian and Wang Xuan arrived at Training Room 23. At this hour, the other students were all resting.

The two of them pushed the door open and entered the small piano room. They heard someone push the door open and enter, followed by Gao Lin’s excited voice.

“Sister Xia Xue, did you tell the dean to only open this training room to you?”

Xia Xue sat down unhappily and said dejectedly, “I’ve already told you, but the dean said that this matter has to be approved by the principal. He still has to consult the principal. I don’t know when it will happen.”

Hearing Xia Xue’s words, a trace of confusion flashed in Gao Lin’s eyes. “Sister Xia Xue, you’re now a female musician hand-picked by Mr. Dong Hua. This is also a matter that will bring glory to the school. Why would the dean consult the principal over such a small matter? However, Sister Xia Xue, I think you should let everyone hear how good you are at the violin. You don’t have to practice it secretly.”

Hearing Gao Lin’s words, Xia Xue shook her head gently and said, “Xia Xue, not everyone will envy me. Some people will even be jealous of me. I just don’t want to cause trouble. Besides, there’s nothing wrong with being humble. Moreover, the concert hasn’t started yet. I should keep a low profile.”

Hearing Xia Xue’s words, Gao Lin nodded in agreement and said, “Sister Xia Xue, you’re right. One has to be wary of others. I hope the school can agree to your request as soon as possible. That way, you can practice without any worries.”

Xia Xue smiled gently and nodded. “I heard from the director that it shouldn’t be difficult to apply for it.”

Wang Xuan, who was standing inside, was speechless when she heard their words. How could this Xia Xue be so pretentious?
