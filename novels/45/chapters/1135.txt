1136 Comforting Her

“I’m fine now.” A smile appeared on Gu Zhou’s slightly pale face. He reached out and held Qiao Nian’s hand, saying softly, “Let’s go home. We should rest well now.”

Although Qiao Nian had already slept in MY and caught up on her sleep on the plane, she had never slept well. She should indeed rest well. After she met her mother, she could go to MY with Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian returned to the Gu family villa. It was already dark. The two of them had been running around for two days. When they returned to An City in the afternoon, they were extremely nervous. Now that they had taken a shower, they lay on the bed and fell asleep not long after.

The next morning, Qiao Nian was woken up by her phone ringing.

“Hello?” Qiao Nian said in a daze.

“Sugar, did I disturb your rest?” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Lu Zhu’s gentle voice came through the phone, and Qiao Nian’s sleepiness instantly dissipated. She hurriedly sat up and glanced at the bed beside her. It was empty, indicating that Gu Zhou had already woken up.

“No, I was already up just now!” Qiao Nian got out of bed and put on her shoes. She stretched and pulled open the curtains!

“Mom and Dad will be back at six this afternoon. Come over for dinner tonight!”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. Her grip loosened, and her cell phone almost fell to the ground. She hurriedly gripped it tightly. “They’re back so soon?”

“Yes! When the time comes, dress up beautifully and come over!”

After Qiao Nian hung up, she glanced at the time. It was about nine o’clock. She walked into the bathroom to wash up and did a simple skincare routine. Then, she opened the closet and began to look for clothes.

Qiao Nian searched through them one by one. These clothes were all quite good-looking, but she felt that none of them were suitable for tonight’s banquet.

When Gu Zhou entered, he saw a large pile of Qiao Nian’s clothes on the bed. At this moment, Qiao Nian was still frowning as she searched her closet.

Gu Zhou walked over to Qiao Nian and hugged her from behind. He raised his hand to smooth her frown. “What’s wrong?”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s voice, she pursed her lips slightly and said worriedly, “My parents will be back tonight. Big Brother asked us to go over for dinner tonight!”

Gu Zhou’s eyes were filled with smiles as he comforted her softly. “Actually, there’s no need for you to be so nervous. You’re mother and daughter. It’s in your blood. She’ll like whatever you wear!”

Gu Zhou’s voice was very gentle and firm!

Qiao Nian pushed Gu Zhou’s hand away and turned to look at him face-to-face, her expression filled with worry. “I just thought of that incident back then…”

“Nian’er!” Gu Zhou interrupted Qiao Nian without hesitation. He looked at her gently and said seriously, “Don’t be afraid. She must have been deceived back then. She definitely doesn’t know anything.”

Qiao Nian stared unblinkingly at Gu Zhou, her beautiful fox-like eyes sparkling. She nodded slightly and smiled. “Yes!”

“It’s still early. Come down for dinner first. After breakfast, we’ll slowly choose our clothes, okay?” Gu Zhou smiled and added, “We still have an afternoon.”

Qiao Nian nodded slightly and replied, “Okay.”

Today, the two children had gone to school. After breakfast, Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou returned to their rooms.

Qiao Nian looked at the clothes on the bed and in the closet. She couldn’t help but frown. “I really don’t know what to wear.”

Qiao Nian had only been applying skincare products just now and hadn’t put on any makeup. Gu Zhou smiled at Qiao Nian and asked, “What style of clothes do you plan to wear today?”

“I don’t know.” Qiao Nian really didn’t know how to face her parents. For some reason, she felt nervous. Every time her parents were mentioned, she couldn’t help but think of Qiao Shan and Su Xue.

She was very worried that no matter what she did, she would be wrong and disliked.

Gu Zhou pushed Qiao Nian to the sofa and sat down. Then, he took out a set of clothes and handed them to Qiao Nian. Smiling, he asked, “I think this set is very suitable.”

Qiao Nian looked at the clothes and said, “Alright, I’ll do as you say and put on some makeup.”
