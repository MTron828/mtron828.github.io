1398 I Won’t Let You

Qiao Nian looked up at him and said seriously, “He’s my senior brother!”

Gu Zhou narrowed his phoenix-like eyes in displeasure and said coldly, “No.”

“Why?” Qiao Nian felt that Gu Zhou’s theory was strange. She explained seriously, “We grew up together. When I was young, he was the one who took care of me when I was sick. When he was sick, I was the one who took care of him. It was just like how you stayed by Grandma’s side when she was not feeling well.”

“I won’t allow it!”

Qiao Nian was speechless.

She finally understood that Gu Zhou was being possessive!

Gu Zhou’s tense expression gradually disappeared, and his eyes softened. He gently tucked her hair behind her ear and pinched Qiao Nian’s face. In a low voice, he said, “I just hope that I’m the one who spends every night with you.”

His voice was slightly low and his voice trailed off, as if he was wheedling at her.

Smiling, Qiao Nian wrapped her arms around Gu Zhou’s neck and said gently, “Yes.”

Gu Zhou had no resistance to Qiao Nian’s sweet smile. He lowered his head slightly and kissed her forehead before standing up. Holding Qiao Nian’s hand, he answered her question. “We realized that everyone in the Lu family villa knows Qi Qi’s whereabouts. It’s not easy to investigate.”

Qiao Nian frowned slightly and asked in confusion, “Didn’t Qi Qi only tell a few people her whereabouts? How did everyone know?”

“Because someone spread it.”

Qiao Nian’s expression changed. With a serious expression, she asked, “Who did that?”

The person who had revealed Qi Qi’s whereabouts was very likely a traitor.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian. “Uncle Zhao.”

Qiao Nian asked curiously, “Did you investigate Uncle Zhao?”

“Yes.” Gu Zhou nodded.

As the two of them spoke, they arrived at the parking lot. After getting into the car, Gu Zhou started the car and told Qiao Nian all the information Chen Qing had found about Uncle Zhao. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Uncle Zhao was an old man in the Lu family villa. He had been by Old Master Lu’s side in the past and had participated in the war. He was Old Master Lu’s right-hand man.

When Old Master Lu was in power, Uncle Zhao could be considered a figure in An City. In that era, he had an arranged marriage. He once married a wife, but because he was rarely at home, his wife took care of his biological mother alone. The couple was still very close.

Once, at the Lu family’s New Year banquet, Old Master Lu had also invited Uncle Zhao’s family. At that time, he had used Old Master Lu’s car to pick up Uncle Zhao’s wife, Su Feng.

At that time, Su Feng was six months pregnant. She took Old Master Lu’s car to a banquet and got into a car accident. At that time, Su Feng died.

Ever since then, Uncle Zhao had never married again and grew old alone.

When Qiao Nian heard Uncle Zhao’s past, she frowned slightly and asked, “Do you suspect that there’s more to Uncle Zhao’s wife’s death?”

“I’ve already gotten someone to investigate. We’ll probably know the results tomorrow,” Gu Zhou said calmly.

Auntie Cao’s cold face appeared in Qiao Nian’s mind again. Uncle Zhao was suspicious, but Auntie Cao was also very strange.

Auntie Cao had always targeted her. Moreover, that day in the ancestral hall, Auntie Cao had been scolded by her brothers. Would she…

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian felt uneasy. She asked, “Did you investigate Auntie Cao?”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he said, “We’ve also investigated. Grandma isn’t in good health. She’s been guarding Grandma by the bed. She doesn’t seem to have time to tell anyone about the news. However, I’ve also asked Chen Qing to investigate her.”

Qiao Nian nodded in agreement and said, “If there’s nothing wrong with them, then investigate the others one by one. We’ll be able to find out.”

When Gu Zhou drove to the Lu family, the sky was already dark.

It was almost twelve o’clock.

The Lu family usually slept early. Gu Zhou had secretly gone out to pick Qiao Nian up himself.

As the lights in the Lu family villa were off, the two of them tiptoed upstairs.

As soon as they walked to the living room, the two of them heard whispers from the kitchen.

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian exchanged a look. They immediately lightened their footsteps and slowly moved to the side of the kitchen.
