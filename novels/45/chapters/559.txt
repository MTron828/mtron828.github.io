Chapter 560: Buying Sperm?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Gu Zhou glanced at Gu Qi, who was lying on the bed, and a trace of guilt flashed in his eyes.

Gu Qi had no parents to take care of him when he was young. Previously, he had even been bullied by the nanny and his personality had almost gone astray. If he hadn’t met her by chance, his life might have been ruined by that nanny.

The two people he had let down the most in his life were Gu Qi and his mother.

Perhaps Gu Qi’s mother’s reluctance to appear had something to do with him. Actually, he wanted to spend his life repaying her, but…

Gu Zhou glanced at Qiao Nian, naturally taking in all the surprise in her eyes. He had a strange feeling.

Before he met Qiao Nian, he had never thought of remarrying.

But after marrying Qiao Nian, he had never thought about getting a divorce again.

Gu Zhou’s frown deepened. At this moment, there was a knock on the door.

“Take care of him first. I’ll be back soon.” With that, Gu Zhou walked out.

Qiao Nian watched as Gu Zhou left. For some reason, she felt that there was something wrong with Gu Zhou’s expression, as if he was holding back something.

Could Gu Zhou be hiding something?

Qiao Nian frowned slightly. She had a vague feeling that what Gu Zhou was hiding might be very important.

Gu Zhou walked out of the room and stood in the corridor. He glanced at the door worriedly, then retracted his gaze and lowered his voice, as if he was afraid of disturbing the sleeping Gu Qi. “What’s wrong?”

“There’s news of Eldest Young Master.” Chen Qing lowered his voice and said, “A year ago, someone saw Eldest Young Master on the streets of MY, but he was far away. There was only a photo.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

With that, Chen Qing showed Gu Zhou the photo on his phone.

Gu Zhou’s long eyelashes drooped. When he saw the two blurry figures in the photo, he immediately recognized that the man in the white shirt was the eldest young master of the Gu family, his eldest brother.

“Any other news?” Gu Zhou asked calmly.

This photo could only mean that the person was still alive a year ago. It did not mean that he was still alive now.

“No. Last year, MY was in turmoil. I wonder if Eldest Young Master left,” Chen Qing said carefully, afraid that Gu Zhou would be angry.

“Continue investigating.” With that, Gu Zhou turned to push the door open. Just as he placed his hand on the door handle, he seemed to have thought of something and turned to look at Chen Qing. “Investigate carefully. Don’t tell Old Madam about this yet.”

Chen Qing nodded.

Gu Zhou walked back into the bedroom and saw Qiao Nian staring at him. He looked away indifferently and his gaze fell on Gu Qi’s face. “Thank you for taking care of him this time.”

“I like him very much. Taking care of him is a piece of cake.” Qiao Nian thought that Gu Qi might be disappointed that he couldn’t find his mommy after he woke up, so she wanted to ask Gu Zhou for more clues. “Do you have any clues about his mommy? I can help look for her. There’s strength in numbers. Perhaps we can find her sooner!”

Gu Zhou paused for a moment. He couldn’t let Qiao Nian know what had happened that night.

Moreover, he knew nothing about Gu Qi’s mother.

“No.”

“What?” Qiao Nian was slightly stunned.

“There are no clues or information!”

Qiao Nian was stunned. How could a living person who had given birth disappear without a trace?

“Then have you asked Gu Qi’s father? He shouldn’t not know anything about the person he slept with, right?”

“He doesn’t know either.”

“This…” Qiao Nian suddenly thought of something. She looked up at Gu Zhou and nodded. “I understand. She’s bought sperm, right?”

Gu Zhou thought, “Was he that poor?”

Qiao Nian continued, “If she bought sperm, he might really not know anything about the woman. Didn’t the hospital register the woman’s information?”
