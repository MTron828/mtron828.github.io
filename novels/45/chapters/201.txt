It was now the birthday of the late eldest daughter of the Lu family.

For breakfast today, Qiao Nian and Matriarch Gu were the only ones present.

Seeing that Gu Zhou’s seat was empty, Matriarch Gu asked in confusion, “Where is Gu Zhou?”

Qiao Nian answered naturally and fluently. “He left the house with Chen Qing early this morning. He didn’t mention when he would be back.”

A trace of surprise flashed in Matriarch Gu’s eyes. Looking at Qiao Nian’s calm expression, she asked with concern, “He… he didn’t bully you, did he?”

“No.” Qiao Nian smiled.

Moreover, Gu Zhou had helped her send Qiao Shan and Su Xue to prison.

Seeing Qiao Nian smile, Matriarch Gu felt relieved. She asked softly, “By the way, about the blessing bag I asked you to make… Is it ready?”

“It’s already done. It’s in my room!” Smiling, Qiao Nian nodded.

“Alright. After this, go and change your clothes, then you’ll accompany me to the Lu family home. Remember to bring the blessing bag along.” The more Matriarch Gu looked at Qiao Nian, the more she liked her. Her Ah Zhou was really lucky to have the obedient and adorable Qiao Nian as his wife. “By the way, Madam Lu would like to thank you in person for saving her the last time.”

Qiao Nian nodded obediently.

After breakfast, Qiao Nian returned to her room to change her clothes. After tidying up, she went to look for the blessing bag. However, to her confusion, the blessing bag that had been placed in the bedside drawer had disappeared.

Qiao Nian rummaged through the bedside drawers, and the bed as well. She even searched the cabinet, but she couldn’t find the blessing bag.

Gu Zhou walked out of the bathroom, wearing a white bathrobe. There were still some water droplets on his muscular chest, and the sash of the bathrobe was tied loosely around his waist.

His hair was wet. Drops of water fell from his forehead, running down his handsome face and landing on his Adam’s apple. His collarbone came next, and finally his chest muscles. The water droplets continued their journey all the way down into his bathrobe.

His phoenix-like eyes were a little red from the heat, giving off an aura of sultriness.

Qiao Nian found herself captivated by Gu Zhou’s eyes. She hurriedly looked away and pursed her lips slightly. In order to prevent awkwardness, she asked softly, “When did you come back?”

“I just got back not long ago.” Drying his hair, Gu Zhou sat down on the sofa with an indifferent expression. Seeing Qiao Nian rummaging through the room, he asked casually, “What are you looking for?”

Qiao Nian raised her hand and tucked her hair behind her ear. Without even glancing at Gu Zhou, she said, “It’s just a dark blue blessing bag. Did you see it?”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Gu Zhou’s thoughts raced. However, he pretended to be calm and said casually, “I’ve already taken it.”

Qiao Nian paused in her search. She quickly walked up to Gu Zhou and reached out a hand. “Give it back.”

Gu Zhou’s expression faltered slightly. He looked at Qiao Nian with an impassive expression and said, “Did you use sandalwood for the aroma?”

He had clearly said that he liked ambergris.

This woman had forgotten his preferences. Yet he wasn’t even angry.

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she nodded. “Yes, I used sandalwood. You took my things without my permission. Give it back, now.”

Gu Zhou had a bad feeling about this.

He had a vague feeling that the blessing bag was not meant for him.

However, Qiao Nian’s next words confirmed his thoughts.

“Give it back to me quickly. We can’t miss the auspicious period for the memorial service.”

“Memorial?” Gu Zhou raised his eyebrow.

“Yes, today is the birthday of the eldest daughter of the Lu family.” Qiao Nian cut straight to the point. “Grandma asked me to make a blessing bag for the eldest daughter of the Lu family. She said it was to pray for her.”

Gu Zhou stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian. He stood up and opened the wardrobe. Inside, there was a password-protected safe. After entering the password, he took out the blessing bag from the wooden box and handed it to Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian knew about Gu Zhou’s password-protected safe. She had heard that Gu Zhou only kept things that were the most important to him in it.

Seeing that Qiao Nian hadn’t taken it from him, Gu Zhou grew displeased. He said coldly, “You don’t want it?”

Qiao Nian hurriedly took it. She didn’t know if it was her imagination, but she felt that Gu Zhou’s eyes had turned even redder.
