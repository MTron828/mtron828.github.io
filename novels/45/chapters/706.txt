Chapter 707: Sophistry

“For my Sugar’s sake?” At Matriarch Lu’s age, how could she not tell that Jiang Yue was deliberately at odds with Qiao Nian?

The matters of the younger generation had nothing to do with her, and she did not want to know.

However, she would never allow Jiang Yue to make things difficult for Qiao Nian on purpose using her eldest granddaughter.

“I’m really doing this for the sake of the eldest daughter of the Lu family!” Jiang Yue explained weakly.

“If you really want what’s best for her, why did you say things like jealousy and sadness?” Matriarch Lu said viciously.

Jiang Yue was so frightened that a chill ran down her spine. She hurriedly shook her head and said aggrievedly, “Grandma Lu, I didn’t mean that. I didn’t mean to…”

“Grand… Didn’t the Matriarch just repeat what you said just now?” Qiao Nian really didn’t want to see Jiang Yue spout nonsense, so she cut off Jiang Yue’s words.

Perhaps it was because she was too anxious, but she almost called Matriarch Lu Grandma.

Fortunately, she changed her words in time.

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. If she really called Matriarch Lu Grandma, those people might be suspicious.

Although Qiao Nian had barely said out the word, Matriarch Lu still heard Qiao Nian’s words. A trace of surprise flashed in her eyes. Her gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s familiar face, and a strange emotion gradually welled up in her heart. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

If she wasn’t wrong, she wanted to call her “Grandma” just now…

The others didn’t notice Qiao Nian’s slip of the tongue. Even Jiang Yue didn’t notice.

Jiang Yue couldn’t wait to explain to Matriarch Lu. “Grandma Lu, I really didn’t know that the Hyacinth had such a beautiful meaning. What I read on the Internet previously might not be comprehensive. I’m really sorry!”

Matriarch Lu looked at Jiang Yue coldly, exuding a dignified aura. “Jiang Yue, if you’re here to send blessings to my eldest granddaughter today, you’re welcome to stay here. If not, please leave immediately!”

Jiang Yue was stunned. She bit her lip and looked at Song Yu helplessly.

Song Yu hesitated for a moment and took a step forward to help Jiang Yue out of the situation. “Grandma, Jiang Yue didn’t do it on purpose. Previously, she was doing it for Sister’s sake. I don’t think Sister will blame her.”

Seeing that Matriarch Lu’s expression had softened a little, Song Yu continued, “Today is Sister’s death anniversary. I think she definitely wants to see our family get along better!”

When Jiang Yue heard Song Yu’s words, she looked grateful and nodded vigorously.

Song Yu was obedient. Matriarch Lu also liked Song Yu a lot. She had lived for so long, so she naturally understood what Song Yu meant.

Song Yu and Jiang Yue were both adopted children. Moreover, because they were in similar situations, they understood each other.

No matter what, Jiang Yue was still a member of the Gu family. Let’s forget about this matter!

Matriarch Lu gave Jiang Yue a meaningful look. She only hoped that Jiang Yue had said those words purely for Sugar’s sake.

However, this would not happen again.

Matriarch Lu raised her hand and waved it gently. She sighed and said, “Forget it, this matter will be over!”

Matriarch Lu really couldn’t say that this was a misunderstanding. If she said that, she would probably hurt Qiao Nian’s heart.

After all, Qiao Nian had worked hard to embroider the blessing bag. This blessing bag must have cost her a lot of effort.

When Jiang Yue heard Matriarch Lu’s words, her heart, which had been in her throat, slowly relaxed.

She hurriedly said obediently, “Thank you, Grandma Lu, for not fussing over it.”

With that, Jiang Yue prepared to offer incense to the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

Gu Zhou’s expression instantly turned cold. He hurriedly stopped Jiang Yue and said, “Wait.”

The smile on Jiang Yue’s face gradually froze. She turned to look at Gu Zhou, her eyes flickering. She had a bad feeling about this and asked, “Brother Ah Zhou, what’s wrong?”

When Gu Zhou heard Jiang Yue’s words, his frown deepened. His expression turned serious as he asked, “Have you forgotten your identity again?”

Jiang Yue blinked in confusion.

“You forgot the reminder she gave you!”
