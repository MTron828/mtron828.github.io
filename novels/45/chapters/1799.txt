Chapter 1800 - 1800 Thank You

“Oh?”

“I remember what happened at that time. I saw that she was pregnant, but during that period of time, Mark went to the front line and was never at home.” Cui Qi said thoughtfully and seriously. “I can’t remember the exact time, because that day, I skipped class and went to the hospital to get the doctor to give me a medical certificate. I saw her go to the hospital alone with her face covered and her big belly. She had heavy makeup on at that time, but there was a red mole on her neck. It was very obvious. I recognized her through the mole.”

When Qiao Nian heard Cui Qi’s words, she was stunned. After a long time, she asked, “Was Princess Annie born at that time?”

“Princess Annie was already in kindergarten,” Cui Qi said without hesitation.

“Thank you. What you said is very useful to me,” Qiao Nian said sincerely.

Cui Qi’s ears turned slightly red. “Miss Qiao, you don’t have to be so polite with me. Just tell me if you need anything.”

“Thank you for your good intentions. You’ve just recovered and should rest more. Don’t be too tired.” Qiao Nian was a doctor and was already used to giving people reminders.

“Okay.”

Qiao Nian watched Cui Qi leave. When she turned around, she saw Gu Zhou standing behind her.

She walked to Gu Zhou’s side and reached out to hold his hand. In a low voice, she said, “When Song Ling was with Mark, she was pregnant. That child was very likely Song Ling’s lover.”

Gu Zhou was stunned for a moment. He asked in surprise, “How come?”

“Cui Qi saw Song Ling go to the hospital in disguise with her pregnant stomach. It seems that there’s someone behind Song Ling.” At this point, Qiao Nian had a bad feeling. She subconsciously looked at Gu Zhou in front of her. “Do you think Song Ling is really dead?”

“Didn’t you see Song Ling’s corpse with your own eyes?” Gu Zhou frowned.

“I saw Song Ling’s corpse with my own eyes, but the lights weren’t on at that time. I didn’t have time to check if Song Ling was really dead.” Qiao Nian suddenly felt uneasy and muttered in a low voice, “If Song Ling was only pretending to be dead at that time, she must have faked her death and escaped.”Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Nian’er.”

“Oh?”

“Aren’t you too nervous? Let me tell you, don’t think too much. The matter has been resolved,” Gu Zhou comforted her softly. He reached out and ruffled Qiao Nian’s hair.

Not far away, Chen Sheng’s eyes gradually darkened when he saw Gu Zhou’s actions. Then, he looked away.

At this moment, outside Mark Castle.

There were two groups of people standing at the entrance of the castle. One was Mark’s loyal supporters, and the other was the president’s men. The two groups of people were each pointing guns at each other, as if as long as someone fired the first shot, a gun battle would instantly start.

The two sides had been in a deadlock. At this moment, the door of the castle slowly opened.

The door was very high and made a lot of noise when it opened.

The two sides, which had been in a stalemate, gripped the guns in their hands tightly. All of them stared nervously at the entrance of the castle.

The first person to walk out of the door was none other than the President. He walked out in a suit, followed by his neatly arranged personal guards.

The president saw that most of Mark’s supporters were from the royal family. His expression was indifferent and his tone was cold. “Causing trouble?”

When Mark’s supporters heard the president’s question, they were so nervous that their hearts were in their throats. They only felt that the president in front of them was completely different from before. The powerful pressure on his body frightened them so much that they could not breathe.

One of Mark’s supporters was standing at the front and was also from the royal family. He lowered his head slightly and said in a much gentler tone, “Mr. President, we heard a strange commotion inside just now. We were worried that someone would harm you, so we wanted to go in and help you.”

The president had one hand in his pocket as he looked at the royal family member with a faint smile.

That person was so frightened that he did not dare to breathe. He pursed his lips nervously and lowered his head even more.
