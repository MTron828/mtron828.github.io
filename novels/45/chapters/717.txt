718 The Truth

However, Jiang Yue had done many things to her. She had brought this upon herself. It had nothing to do with anyone else.

A pitiful person must have something hateful about her.

Gu Zhou looked at Jiang Yue as if he was looking at a dead person. There was no warmth in his eyes.

The people around them looked at Jiang Yue with complicated expressions.

Jiang Yue was a fool. Even if she threw the perfume bottle into the bushes now, would it disappear from this world?

The answer was no.

Even if the perfume bottle was broken, if it was really filled with sulfuric acid, the corrosive soil would definitely leave traces.

Qiao Nian glanced at Jiang Yue and walked towards the perfume bottle. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The soil in the garden was looser, and the perfume bottle had not broken after being thrown in.

Qiao Nian brought the perfume bottle over. She got someone to prepare a glass bowl and placed a small branch in it. Then, she opened the perfume bottle and poured out the liquid inside.

The moment she opened the perfume bottle, everyone smelled the pungent smell and hurriedly covered their mouths and noses.

When the liquid in the perfume bottle touched the branch, it instantly corroded.

There was no need for Qiao Nian to say anything else. Everyone knew that Jiang Yue had sprinkled sulfuric acid on the blessing bag, causing the urn of the eldest daughter of the Lu family to corrode.

Qiao Nian looked at Jiang Yue, who had fallen to the ground. Her heart turned cold as she said, “I think I’m not the one who should apologize to your mother, but you!”

Jiang Yue lowered her head in a daze. Now that the truth was in front of her and the evidence was complete, she could no longer quibble.

Why?

Why had she still failed this time?

This was the solution she had painstakingly thought of. She even took out her mother’s belongings, poured out the perfume inside, and put the concentrated sulfuric acid in.

She had done all of this to slander Qiao Nian without anyone knowing.

But why did it still fail?

Was God really unwilling to give her a chance?

Matriarch Lu looked at Jiang Yue in disbelief. She was extremely shocked, and her eyes were filled with disappointment and anger.

Jiang Yue used to be smart. How had she become like this?

How could she be so ruthless as to do such a thing?

That was a gift left behind by her mother!

When Jiang Yue took out the perfume just now, she did not suspect at all that there was something else in the perfume bottle.

After all, no one was willing to ruin their mother’s belongings.

However, she had never expected Jiang Yue to be willing to pour out all the perfume.

The more Matriarch Lu thought about it, the angrier she became. She reprimanded angrily, “How could you do this? That was left behind for you by your mother. How dare you add sulfuric acid to it? Aren’t you afraid that your mother will die with her eyes wide open?”

Jiang Yue was already sobbing uncontrollably.

Mom.

She felt really sorry for her mother.

But she was still alive. She had to make a decision for her future life.

The only person she could rely on was herself.

Jiang Yue slowly lowered her gaze and said with a pained expression, “That’s why I didn’t want to do this either. I was forced…”

Other than Matriarch Lu, Song Yu was also the most shocked.

Song Yu and Jiang Yue had a good relationship. The two of them had grown up together and shared everything.

However, Song Yu had never expected Jiang Yue to do such a heartless thing.

Song Yu questioned sadly, “When did my sister offend you? Why would she force you? Why did you do this to her?”

“I’m really sorry. I never thought of attacking the eldest daughter of the Lu family. The reason I did all these was actually because of Qiao Nian!”

Jiang Yue pointed at Qiao Nian and got up from the ground. Her voice was also filled with excitement. “If it weren’t for her, Grandma and I wouldn’t have quarreled, and Grandma wouldn’t have chased me out of the Gu family. I was still the eldest daughter of the Gu family, but now I’ve become an orphan!”

The more Jiang Yue thought about it, the angrier she became. She could no longer hide the hatred in her eyes. “She stole my grandmother and Brother Ah Zhou. She stole everything from me…”
