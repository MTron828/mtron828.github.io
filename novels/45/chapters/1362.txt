1363 Traffic Jam

Qin Chuan turned to look at Lu Qi beside him. Caught off guard, he met those sparkling eyes and looked away to face the road ahead. Only then did he nod. “Yes.”

A trace of surprise flashed in Lu Qi’s eyes. It was obvious that she did not expect Qin Chuan to agree to build a snowman with her. Anticipation rose in her heart.

“Qi Qi.”

Qin Chuan slowly stopped the car. There were originally many cars on the highway, but there was a traffic jam ahead. He stared unblinkingly at Lu Qi.

Lu Qi looked at Qin Chuan, her obsidian-like eyes filled with laughter. “Huh?”

Qin Chuan’s heart skipped a beat. He thought that his grandfather would probably like someone with a warm smile like her!

Seeing that Qin Chuan was silent for a long time, Lu Qi leaned towards him and greeted him with a smile, “Senior Brother.”

When Qin Chuan came back to his senses, he saw Lu Qi’s enlarged face in front of him. He could clearly see the tender hair on Lu Qi’s face and her smooth, fair, and delicate skin.

“We could have arrived at the village in two hours, but there’s a traffic jam now. The GPS shows that we’ll be stuck in traffic for at least an hour.” Qin Chuan’s gaze fell on the GPS in the car as he said calmly.

Lu Qi looked at the contents on the GPS and a trace of helplessness flashed in her eyes. Then, she smiled and said, “It looks like there’ll be a long traffic jam, but we can take a look at the snow. You won’t be able to see such beautiful scenery in the city.”

The mountains in the distance were already covered in snow. The entire world seemed to have turned white.

The hard work of the workers in the city would clear most of the snow.

“Yes.” Qin Chuan’s lips curved up slightly as he retracted his gaze.

Lu Qi initially wanted to get out of the car to play. Many people had gotten out of the car to have a snowball fight because of the traffic jam. She glanced at Qin Chuan, who was looking down at his phone.

She was the joy of the Lu family. Usually, she was lively and cheerful. No matter who she was talking to, as long as she wanted to chat with them, she could find all kinds of topics. She would never let both parties fall into an awkward silence.

However, when that person became Qin Chuan, Lu Qi didn’t know how to interact with him. She silently closed her eyes and rested on the spot.

Lu Qi had only closed her eyes to rest. She didn’t know when she had really fallen asleep.

Suddenly, the car trembled violently. In a daze, Lu Qi heard a loud bang.

“Qi Qi!”

Qin Chuan’s cold voice and the impact and vibration of the huge rock hitting the back seat of the car woke Lu Qi up from her sleep!

Lu Qi opened her eyes and saw Qin Chuan holding the steering wheel nervously.

The surroundings were very dark. She saw the lights on both sides of the road and realized that they were now in a tunnel on the highway.

The tunnel was flickering with yellow light, and gravel fell from the sky. Qin Chuan stepped on the accelerator and drove forward as fast as he could, trying hard to avoid the falling rocks.

Although Qin Chuan had already used all his strength, a huge rock smashed down in front of him, blocking his path.

Lu Qi’s face was pale as she gripped her seatbelt tightly. What was going on?

Qin Chuan quickly turned the steering wheel and was about to move in another direction when another huge rock fell, blocking the exit tightly. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Qin Chuan quickly stepped on the brakes and the car barely stopped. Qin Chuan immediately drove to the triangle in the corner. At this moment, the huge rock above the tunnel rumbled and collapsed.

Lu Qi heard the sound of a huge rock collapsing and cars colliding.

This was the first time Lu Qi had seen such a terrifying thing. She had seen many disaster movies, but none of them were as terrifying as what she was experiencing now. She was so frightened that she covered her ears and screamed.

The huge rock smashed into the roof of the car, and the roof of the back seat caved in. Qin Chuan hurriedly unbuckled his seatbelt and threw himself in front of Lu Qi before the other huge rock smashed down, protecting her tightly in his arms.

Feeling the warm embrace, the fear on Lu Qi’s body lessened significantly. She stopped screaming and opened her eyes, trembling. She saw Qin Chuan protecting her in his arms.

Lu Qi trembled all over. She looked at Qin Chuan in front of her. She had never expected Senior to disregard his own safety and protect her at such a dangerous moment.
