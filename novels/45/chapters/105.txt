Qiao Shan also felt that Qiao Nian had gone too far. Haughtily, he said, “Hurry up and bring back all the Suranne Grass that you’ve taken to the Gu residence. Then, I won’t pursue the fact that you talked back to your elders today!”

Qiao Nian clenched her fists tightly.

Ha!

Pursuing the matter.

What a great turn of phrase!

Qiao Nian had never expected Qiao Shan to brazenly shield Qiao Xin, the thief, just for a pot of Suranne Grass.

Qiao Nian was even starting to doubt whether she was Qiao Shan and Su Xue’s biological daughter. Why did their attitudes towards their two daughters differ so much?

Qiao Nian put away her thoughts and looked coldly at Qiao Xin, her lips curving up slightly as she said, “Qiao Xin, since you don’t want to return the Suranne Grass, then I won’t want it either. But you have to think this through carefully. Whether you can afford to keep this pot of Suranne Grass around is a

matter you evidently haven’t considered. When the time comes, I hope you won’t kneel down and beg me to accept it!”

Qiao Nian’s eyes flashed with ice.

Qiao Xin stood behind Su Xue. She hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to change her mind.

However, Qiao Xin soon understood. Qiao Nian had grown up in the countryside and had always wanted to return to the Qiao family.

For the sake of the Suranne Grass, her father had been kind to Qiao Nian. Qiao Nian must have been so touched that she wanted to cry.

Qiao Xin smiled and said gently, “Sister, don’t worry. I will take good care of this pot of Suranne Grass.”

After receiving Qiao Xin’s answer, Qiao Nian left without turning back, leaving the Qiao family in a state of confusion.

Qiao Xin heaved a sigh of relief. Fortunately, Qiao Nian had relented.

Qiao Shan looked at Qiao Nian’s retreating back and frowned. He said worriedly, “She clearly cared a lot about this pot of Suranne Grass. Why did she suddenly change her mind?”

The more Qiao Shan thought about it, the more worried he became. He was afraid that Qiao Nian would use the Gu family’s connections to force them to send the Suranne Grass back.

Qiao Xin’s mind was filled with thoughts of gifting this pot of Suranne Grass to Su Yan. That way, the two of them could reconcile.

Thus, Qiao Xin said disapprovingly, “You’re over-thinking. Qiao Nian cultivated the Suranne Grass behind our backs. She probably felt that she was in the wrong and wanted to use this pot of Suranne Grass to please Dad.”

When Qiao Shan heard Qiao Xin’s words, his frown grew deeper. He had a nagging feeling that things weren’t as simple as they seemed.

Qiao Xin quickly walked to Qiao Shan’s side and tugged on Qiao Shan’s sleeve like a spoiled child, saying ingratiatingly, “Alright, Dad, stop letting your imagination run wild. Can you give me this pot of Suranne Grass?”

Qiao Shan was initially worrying over whether Qiao Nian would have other tricks up her sleeve. When he heard Qiao Xin’s words, worry was written all over his face. Puzzled, he asked, “Why do you want the Suranne Grass?”

Hence, Qiao Xin told Qiao Shan and Su Xue her plans to firmly secure her relationship with Su Yan.

Qiao Shan and Su Xue had initially wanted to use the Suranne Grass to bring the Gu family to greater heights, but those things didn’t seem to be as important as Qiao Xin’s lifelong happiness, so the two of them nodded and gave the Suranne Grass to Qiao Xin.

‘When Qiao Nian stepped out of the Qiao family’s residence, she was shrouded in a cold aura. She took out her cell phone and sent a text: [Pay close attention to every move the Qiao family makes. Report to me if anything happens. ]

[Yes.] Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Nian put her phone back into her bag and walked to her car. She opened the door and got in.

She had to find a way to get the Qiao family to send the Suranne Grass back. Moreover, she would ensure that they would never dare to have any designs on her medicinal herbs ever again.

When Qiao Nian arrived at the Gu family villa, she saw a pickup truck parked outside.

Lin Tao got out of the pickup truck. When she saw Qiao Nian, she quickly ran over and gave her a big hug. “Nian Nian.”

Qiao Nian was beaming as she reached out to hug Lin Tao. After letting go of Lin Tao, she asked, “Isn’t there an exam today? Why did you come here personally?”

“The examinations aren’t difficult. I can take them quite easily. However, these medicinal herbs are simply priceless. If I lose one of them, my father will probably die from heartache. I’ll only feel at ease if I see them for myself.” Lin Tao smiled at Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian thought of what happened to her Suramne Grass and asked, “Did you tell your father how many stalks of Suranne Grass I’ve grown?”

“Not yet. Didn’t you say that you wanted to give him a surprise? That’s why I didn’t say anything.” At this point, Lin Tao couldn’t help but sigh and say, “I wonder who has the guts to steal Suranne Grass! If I catch this person, I’ll definitely send her to jail!”
