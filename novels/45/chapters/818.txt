819 Argument

Song Man looked over and met Qiao Nian’s gaze. Her expression instantly darkened.

Who did Qiao Nian think she was?

She was just something to flush!

How dare she show off in front of her?

When she returned to the Lu family and her children acknowledged their ancestors, she would be the most respected woman in the world. Qiao Nian wasn’t even worthy of carrying her shoes.

“Why did you hit the child?” Qiao Nian’s eyes were cold, and her voice was firm and unceremonious.

Song Man met Qiao Nian’s gaze fearlessly and said coldly, “You must be the Auntie Nian Nian Xiao Shi was talking about!”

“Why did you hit the child?” Qiao Nian asked coldly.

She did not care about anything else. She was only concerned about why Song Man had hit the child.

A child was a gift from the heavens to adults. A child was an innocent and adorable angel.

If Song Man could raise such a gentle, adorable, and kind child, why did she still hit her child?

She really didn’t know how lucky she was.

Qiao Nian’s eyes grew colder and colder, as if they were tinged with cold poison.

When Song Man heard Qiao Nian’s words, she frowned and said coldly, “Mothers have to teach children when they make mistakes. I’m her mother. She did something wrong, so I should hit her. What’s wrong with that? Miss Qiao, please don’t interfere. If a child can’t be taught well when he is young, he’ll be lawless in the future. Don’t you know that blindly supporting a child will lead a child down the wrong path?”

Song Man sneered and continued, “Of course I have to teach my child well. Miss Qiao, please stand aside. Don’t disturb me from teaching my child!”

What Song Man meant was that Qiao Nian was just an outsider. She shouldn’t disturb her when she was disciplining her child.

Qiao Nian stood there coldly, not retreating at all because of Song Man’s words.

After reading the diary, she was about to return. She had wanted to call Lin Tao first and ask about the situation here.

However, after she picked up the call, she realized that Xiao Zhou wanted to pretend to be Xiao Shi and be alone with his mommy.

She had always found Xiao Shi’s mother a little strange.

If a child worked with his mother in his teens, Qiao Nian might think that it was normal. However, a five-year-old child’s hands were covered in calluses. It was obvious that she had done a lot of work at home.

Which mother in this world would bear to let her child do so much work?

She had suspected Song Man before, but she could not confirm if she was the mother of the two children.

Precisely because she could not be sure of this, she wanted to wait and see. After confirming Song Man’s true identity, she would think about what to do next.

However, her sixth sense told Qiao Nian that Song Man was definitely a dangerous person.

Qiao Nian would never allow Gu Qi to be alone with a dangerous person.

When Xiao Shi went to the Gu residence yesterday, Gu Zhou did not realize that she was not Gu Qi.

That was because Gu Zhou’s heart was filled with the desire to take care of his child, so he would not let his imagination run wild. Moreover, Gu Zhou did not know that there was still Xiao Shi in this world.

But Song Man was different.

Song Man was a woman. A woman’s heart was very delicate to begin with.

If Song Man realized that something was wrong with her child’s expression, she might quickly realize that the child in front of her was Gu Qi.

She didn’t know what Song Man wanted to do, but she was very worried about Gu Qi’s safety, so she drove back.

She had just walked to the door when she heard Song Man and Gu Qi arguing. Before she could push the door open and enter, she stole a glance through the glass window and saw Gu Qi being slapped by Song Man.

When she saw this, her heart was about to jump out of her throat.

Although Gu Qi was not her child, she had long treated him as her own. She would never allow anyone to bully her child.

She knew very well that the woman in front of her was Gu Qi’s biological mother, but she really couldn’t accept that Song Man had hit Gu Qi.

In the past five years, Song Man had not taken care of Gu Qi for a single day. Just because Gu Qi had a different opinion from her, she wanted to hit him?

Was this what a mother should do?

In Qiao Nian’s opinion, if a child makes a mistake, adults should reason with them first. If that really didn’t work, they could use other methods.

Song Man did not reason with Gu Qi at all, and she went out of hand.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com
