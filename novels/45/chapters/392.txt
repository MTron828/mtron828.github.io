Chapter 393: Luring Her Into The Trap

Jiang Yue’s breathing quickened. What had happened tonight flashed across her mind, and she finally understood the flaw in Qiao Nian’s words.

She was looking for someone to buy tea leaves. It was already so late, so the person selling tea leaves wouldn’t have contacted Grandma directly. Moreover, that person didn’t say that she had asked him to buy tea leaves!

Therefore, from the beginning, this was a lie that Qiao Nian had made up.

This lie was to lure her into the trap!

If it were any other time, she would definitely think calmly and see if there were any flaws!

However, just now, Brother Zhou had said that he wanted to chase her away, and the butler had said that this represented her grandmother’s own feelings, so she had blurted out everything without thinking.

A trace of anger flashed across Jiang Yue’s eyes. She suddenly stood up and questioned fiercely, “Qiao Nian! You were the one who planned this, right? You wanted to force me to tell you about those things!”

“Smart!” Qiao Nian nodded in agreement.

Jiang Yue’s hands clenched into fists tightly, then slowly loosened. She tilted her head to look at Gu Zhou and said, “Brother Ah Zhou, did you hear that? She has already admitted that she was the one who schemed against me. Actually, those things have nothing to do with me!”

A trace of sarcasm flashed across Gu Zhou’s face. “And then?”

Just as Jiang Yue was about to say something else, she saw Gu Zhou’s cold face and realized that he was acting with Qiao Nian.

So everyone was acting and waiting for her to fall into the trap.

“How could you do that?” Jiang Yue asked in disbelief.

......

“If I hadn’t done that, how would I have known that I had raised an ingrate all these years?” Old Madam Gu’s voice came from the side. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Zhao Qian helped Old Madam Gu out from the side.

A trace of disappointment and sadness flashed across Old Madam Gu’s face. She really did not expect that the child she had personally raised would actually do such a thing.

“Grandma?” Jiang Yue’s heart was in her throat. She asked in disbelief, “Grandma… you’re actually involved. Do you trust Qiao Nian that much?”

Old Madam Gu’s expression instantly darkened.

Until now, Jiang Yue had not realized her mistake.

When she heard Jiang Yue crying just now, her heart almost broke. She almost came out to stop them.

However, when she thought of what Nian Nian had said, she stopped in her tracks.

She also wanted Nian Nian to know that Jiang Yue was a good child and wouldn’t do such a thing. It would be a good opportunity for the two of them to bury the hatchet and prosper in the future.

However, Old Madam Gu had never expected Jiang Yue to do such a thing.

Jiang Yue was her god granddaughter. In fact, she treated Jiang Yue as well as her daughter.

She wanted to make Jiang Yue a top socialite. She was also very happy to see Jiang Yue gradually become outstanding.

Old Madam Gu did not dare to imagine that Jiang Yue would actually hurt her.

What she did not dare to imagine was that if Nian Nian had not been smart today, she would probably have been ruined.

Old Madam Gu was so sad that tears streamed down her face. How could she have raised such a vicious child?

Seeing that Old Madam Gu was crying, Jiang Yue felt terrible. She ran over and complained while crying, “Ever since Qiao Nian came to our house, you’ve become biased. I’ve clearly been accompanying you, but…”

Bam—

Old Madam Gu raised her hand and slapped Jiang Yue. In the end, she took a few steps back in pain.

“Grandma!” Zhao Qian quickly supported Old Madam Gu and called out softly.

“Grandma!” Qiao Nian quickly walked forward and supported Old Madam Gu. “Grandma, you can’t get angry now. You have to be careful of your health!”

Old Madam Gu looked at Qiao Nian guiltily. She held Qiao Nian’s hand and said, “Nian Nian, it’s all my fault. I actually raised an ingrate by my side!”
