Not only was Shen Mei speaking slowly, but she was also especially gentle. If Qiao Nian didn’t know about Shen Mei’s situation, she would have thought that she was a normal person at first glance.

Smiling, Qiao Nian sat on a stool by the bed and looked at Shen Mei. “Madam, how was your sleep last night?”

“Okay,” Shen Mei said slowly.

Lina looked at Shen Mei’s expression and her lips curved up slightly. Just as she was about to speak, her phone rang. When she saw the caller ID, her expression changed slightly.

Lina smiled at Shen Mei and said softly, “Mom, I have something to do. I’ll go out for a while. Talk to Doctor Qiao.”

Hearing Lina’s words, Shen Mei nodded obediently. “Okay.”

Lina stood up and moved closer to Shen Mei. She gently planted a kiss on Shen Mei’s forehead before saying, “Then I’ll leave.”

Shen Mei smiled gently, her eyes filled with stars.

Lina glanced at Qiao Nian again and said gratefully, “Nian Nian, I’ll go out for a while. Sorry to trouble you.”

“Just go about your business.” Qiao Nian smiled.

Lina smiled gratefully. Holding the cell phone, she walked out and closed the door. Only then did she look at the cell phone that was vibrating non-stop.

The smile on her face instantly disappeared as she picked up the call.

Fourth Princess Aisha’s furious voice came through the cell phone. “Lina, is there something wrong with your brain like your mother!”

Lina frowned. She knew that there was nothing good about Aisha’s call. She walked towards the rockery not far away and said coldly, “Aisha, if you’re crazy, you should go to the mental hospital now. If you speak rudely to my mother again, I’ll hand the recording of the call to your father, Earl Harry.”

The person on the other end of the cell phone paused for a moment, and her voice grew sharper. “Lina, other than complaining, what else do you know how to do? Let Sister Annie go quickly!”

Lina didn’t need to think to know that Aisha was calling for Annie. On the surface, Aisha was calling for Annie, but in reality, she was pretending to be concerned because she liked Wright. Aisha was taking the initiative to solve Wright’s problem.

She really couldn’t understand why Aisha liked Wright. Wright was a despicable and cunning person.

“Annie is suspected of murdering Madam President.” Lina straightened her throat and said coldly, “Everyone in the country knows about this. Why do you, Princess Aisha, want to go against the entire country?”

“That’s impossible. Sister Annie is so gentle and kind. It’s absolutely impossible for her to do such a thing.” The more Aisha spoke, the angrier she became. She said ruthlessly, “Lina, you’re really too despicable. In order to obtain Wright’s love, you actually used Sister Annie as a threat. I’m at the entrance of the palace now. Come out and let’s talk!”

Worried that Lina would not come out, Aisha shouted, “If you don’t, I’ll announce to the world that your mother is a fool. Do as you see fit!”

With that, Aisha hung up without hesitation.

Lina frowned when she heard the busy tone on her cell phone. Reluctantly, she walked out of the palace.

…

In Shen Mei’s room.

Qiao Nian took Shen Mei’s pulse. Yesterday’s acupuncture and medicine had already stabilized Shen Mei’s condition. The Hypnotic worm in Shen Mei’s body was also in a deep sleep. It seemed that as long as she drank the tonic on time today, she would be fine.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian retracted her hand and smiled at Shen Mei. “Madam, your condition has stabilized now. When the herbs arrive, you’ll be more than half better.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Really?” With a smile in her eyes, Shen Mei enunciated each word clearly.

Qiao Nian smiled and nodded. As if they were chatting, she asked, “What does Madam usually like to do?”

“Read.” Shen Mei glanced at the book beside her and picked it up, placing it by her chest. “This book is good.”

“Madam is amazing. I heard that one can understand a lot of life principles by studying.” Qiao Nian spoke slowly. “My mother’s teacher said this. By the way, his surname is Shen like Madam’s. His name is Shen An.”

When Qiao Nian said the words “Shen An”, she stared unblinkingly at Shen Mei’s face.

Shen Mei stood there in a daze, as if someone had pressed a pause button. She did not say a word.
