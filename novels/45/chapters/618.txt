Chapter 619: Lying

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Gu Zhou hesitated for a moment before asking, “Then, do you have anything that Dad can help you with?”

Hearing Gu Zhou’s words, Gu Qi’s eyes lit up, but they quickly dimmed.

His father looked a little stupid. Could he really help him fulfill his wish?

Seeing Gu Qi deep in thought, Gu Zhou asked in a low voice, “What’s wrong?”

“I want Mommy to go home.”

“Little Qi, I told you before that your mommy has already…”

“You don’t have to lie to me anymore. You couldn’t find Mommy because you’re useless. You can’t tell me that Mommy is dead.” When Gu Qi heard that Gu Zhou was going to lie to him again, he frowned and said unhappily.

There was a trace of anger in his voice. His father was really too stupid. He was useless.

It seemed that he could only rely on himself to find Mommy.

When Gu Zhou heard Gu Qi’s words, he was stunned.

Previously, he had always thought that his son could not speak. Even if he could speak, he would only know a few simple words. He did not expect him to be able to speak so long at once.

Gu Zhou’s heart ached, but he was also a little happy. He reached out to hug Gu Qi, but Gu Qi dodged to the side. His hand stopped awkwardly in midair.

Gu Zhou silently retracted his hand. He looked at Gu Qi seriously and asked, “Who told you that your mommy is still alive?”

Gu Qi lowered his head. He recalled what he had heard Gu Zhou and Chen Qing say that night. Pursing his lips, he said, “When you changed my nanny that day, I heard you talking to Uncle Chen Qing.”

When Gu Zhou heard the word “nanny”, he instantly felt sad.

Gu Zhou looked at Gu Qi with heartache and said, “Did you hear everything we said that night?”

“Hm.”

Gu Qi nodded. He seemed to have recalled something. Frowning, he continued, “Dad, although I’m mentally retarded in your eyes, I’m not deaf. I can still hear what you’re saying.”

When Gu Zhou heard the word mentally retarded, his expression changed slightly. He said coldly, “Who told you that you were mentally retarded?”

“If I’m not mentally retarded, why did you find so many doctors to treat me?” Gu Qi asked calmly. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

When Gu Zhou heard Gu Qi’s question, a trace of confusion flashed in his eyes. He asked, “When did I find a doctor for you?”

Gu Qi looked at Gu Zhou calmly and said nothing.

Gu Zhou felt a little strange under Gu Qi’s gaze. He frowned slightly. In his memory, he had seen a psychiatrist walk out of Gu Qi’s room and tell him about Gu Qi’s condition.

At that time, he had thought that Chen Qing had taken the initiative to invite a doctor over to treat Gu Qi.

“So Dad likes to lie too,” Gu Qi said calmly. He recalled the past and his face instantly turned pale.

“I—”

“Anyway, this isn’t the first time Dad has lied.” Gu Qi lowered his gaze and said in a low voice, “Previously, you told me that Mommy was already dead. In reality, you just didn’t manage to find her.”

Gu Qi really didn’t know how to answer Little Qi.

“Dad just wants to protect you and take good care of you,” Gu Zhou said weakly. He had no recollection of what Little Qi had said, but Little Qi didn’t seem to be lying.

“Dad, you don’t have to lie to me anymore. I know you hate me the most!” Gu Qi’s face was pale. His lips were slightly parted, and the light in his eyes gradually disappeared.

“How is this possible? I…”

But before Gu Zhou could finish speaking, Gu Qi sat up straight and looked at him unblinkingly. He was so upset that his eyes turned red. “You clearly said that you liked girls the most! You don’t like me at all!”

Gu Zhou was stunned. This was the first time he had seen Gu Qi in tears. He seemed to have suffered greatly.

Gu Zhou tried hard to recall what had happened. He was certain that he had never said such ugly words to Gu Qi.

What puzzled Gu Zhou was that he had clearly never found a psychiatrist for Gu Qi, nor had he said so many unpleasant words. Why did Gu Qi keep misunderstanding him?
