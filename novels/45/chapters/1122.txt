Lu Qi was burning with anxiety. When she reached the entrance of the cafe, Lu Qi looked at the endless stream of cars outside. She clutched her stomach and pretended to have a stomachache. She looked up at Jiang Chi. “Brother Jiang, my stomach isn’t feeling well. I want to go to the bathroom. Is that okay?”

Jiang Chi nodded.

Thinking that Lu Qi was going to return to the bathroom in the cafe, the bodyguards stepped aside slightly. Lu Qi immediately used all her strength and ran to the other side!

Jiang Chi stood beside the car and looked at Lu Qi’s retreating back, his eyes filled with hostility. “Catch her!”

Actually, without Jiang Chi’s permission, the bodyguards would have chased after Lu Qi long ago.

Other than staying in the library, Lu Qi usually stayed at home and did not exercise much. How could she outrun those bodyguards?

In less than a minute, Lu Qi was escorted to Jiang Chi by the bodyguards.

There were many onlookers around. Some of them even took out their phones to record the commotion.

Jiang Chi gave the bodyguards a look, and they immediately escorted Lu Qi into the cafe.

Jiang Chi gestured for the other bodyguards to deal with the people who had taken videos. With one hand in his pocket, he slowly walked into the cafe.

Lu Qi was brought into that private room again. She tried hard to remain calm.

When Lu Qi calmed down, in the next second, she saw a black gun pointed directly at her.

She could still smell the smoke from the gun. She knew that no matter what she said, Jiang Chi would not give her a chance. She slowly closed her eyes. She knew that she would be on her way to hell soon.

What made Lu Qi the saddest was that her parents had just found her sister. If anything happened to her, her parents would definitely not be able to accept this blow.

At this moment, the door of the private room was kicked open with a bang.

Jiang Chi turned around. Before he could see who it was, he saw someone rushing towards him.

Jiang Chi saw that person rush up to Lu Qi. Frowning, he fired at the person who had barged in.

Lu Qi was stunned. She seemed to be hugged tightly by someone. Her face was pressed tightly against the man’s chest, and her left ear was filled with the man’s strong heartbeat. Her right ear was covered by someone’s hand. In a daze, she still heard the gunshot.

She could vaguely hear a groan from the man above her.

Lu Qi was stunned. Her nervous heart was already in her throat.

She could hear the man’s heart beating faster and faster. The hand on her right ear gradually relaxed, and the man’s slightly hoarse voice came from above her head. “How are you?”

Lu Qi’s heart was beating like a drum. She looked up in confusion and saw a scar on the man’s cheek. She realized belatedly that the scar was a bullet graze. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The blood on the man’s face slid down his cheek and dripped onto Lu Qi’s forehead.

His blood was burning hot, and the heat spread throughout his body.

Before Lu Qi could speak, she was shielded behind the man. The man and Jiang Chi faced each other.

Lu Qi looked up at the man’s back. The man was tall and majestic. It was as if she had seen her father and brothers. Her heart slowly calmed down.

When Jiang Chi saw who it was, his expression instantly turned cold. He gripped the pistol in his hand tightly. “Qin Chuan, why are you here?”

Qin Chuan took out a pistol from his pocket and aimed it at Jiang Chi. “I’m looking for someone!”

Although Qin Chuan had only said two words, his words revealed a strong domineering aura.

Lu Qi was someone he wanted to take away. No one could stop him!

Jiang Chi looked at Qin Chuan coldly and sneered. “How suicidal are you to snatch her from me?”

“Why not?” Qin Chuan looked at Jiang Chi expressionlessly with a cold smile on his face!

“Lu Qi is my brother’s fiancée. I can’t let you take her away!” Jiang Chi’s eyes grew more and more serious as he gripped his pistol tightly.

When Qin Chuan heard Jiang Chi’s words, he was slightly stunned. He frowned and asked, “Didn’t your brother pass away two years ago? If I remember correctly, he was still single two years ago!”
