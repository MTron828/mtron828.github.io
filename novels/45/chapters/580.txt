Gu Zhou sat by the bed and looked at Gu Qi’s slightly angry face. His mood couldn’t help but improve.

Gu Qi looked more like a child now. He hoped that he would continue to be like this.

“Not only did Auntie hug me, but she also smiled at me. Auntie must like me more,” Gu Qi said proudly. “It’s useless even if Dad got to know Auntie earlier. Auntie doesn’t like you!”

If Gu Qi had a tail, it would probably be wagging in the air.

Gu Zhou looked at him dotingly and nodded. “Yes, I can tell. She likes you the most. Alright, lie down quickly. She might be back soon!”

Hearing Gu Zhou’s words, Gu Qi lay down on the bed in satisfaction, looking extremely obedient.

Gu Zhou looked at Gu Qi with heartache. At this moment, Gu Qi looked like a child.

“Dad, you should say that Auntie only likes me. She doesn’t like you.” Gu Qi lay on the pillow, still struggling with this matter.

Gu Zhou was speechless.

Although his son was very possessive, he realized that his son was not stupid at all. His logic was very strong. Otherwise, why would he want Qiao Nian’s favor?

Qiao Nian was his wife. How could she dote on Gu Qi alone?

Gu Zhou couldn’t bring himself to say this.

Just as Gu Qi was about to speak, Qiao Nian pushed the door open and walked in holding a bowl of millet porridge.

She smiled at Gu Qi, completely unaware of the stalemate between Gu Qi and Gu Zhou.

Gu Qi’s grape-like eyes were fixed intently on Qiao Nian. All his attention was on Qiao Nian’s face. When he saw Qiao Nian sitting by the bed without even looking at Gu Zhou, his lips curved into a faint smile. The smile was faint, but it quickly disappeared.

Of course, Gu Zhou saw Gu Qi’s expression. Suddenly, he began to doubt his own eyes. In the past, he had only felt that he didn’t understand Qiao Nian. Now, he felt that he didn’t even understand his own son.

Qiao Nian didn’t know what Gu Zhou was thinking. She sat by the bed very naturally.

Gu Zhou stood up and moved to the side, giving up his seat to Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian sat by the bed. Suddenly, the phone in her pocket rang. She took out her phone, glanced at it, and swiftly hung up.

Gu Qi raised his eyebrows at Gu Zhou, as if to say, “Look, Auntie cares about me the most. She doesn’t even pick up the phone because she has to feed me.”

Gu Zhou retracted his gaze indifferently. He had noticed the caller ID on Qiao Nian’s phone just now. “Brother Zhu.”

Gu Zhou’s frown deepened. Frustrated, he sat down on a chair.

Qiao Nian stirred the bowl in her hand for a while. Afraid that Gu Qi would get anxious from waiting, she said gently, “The porridge is still a little hot. You can drink it when it gets cold.”

Gu Qi nodded.

After a while, Qiao Nian felt that the porridge wasn’t as hot as it had been. She was about to help Gu Qi up when she realized that Gu Qi was looking at her eagerly. He looked like he was hungry and wanted to eat, but didn’t have the strength to sit up.

Did he want her to feed him?

Qiao Nian instantly understood. Smiling, she said, “Alright, I’ll feed you.”

Gu Qi nodded obediently and let Qiao Nian feed him. He even gave Gu Zhou a provocative and proud look when Qiao Nian lowered her head to look at the bowl.

Gu Zhou felt that Gu Qi was just showing off. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Gu Qi was clearly saying.

“Look, Auntie only dotes on me. Auntie is feeding me now, but Auntie isn’t feeding you!”

Gu Zhou lowered his gaze silently and turned his head to the side. He could no longer be bothered with Gu Qi. He felt that letting him stay in this room was unnecessary.

What he disliked the most was that Gu Qi’s acting skills were too good.

In the past, he would stop eating after taking two bites.

Now, Qiao Nian was feeding him. After finishing a bowl, he still looked like he wanted more.
