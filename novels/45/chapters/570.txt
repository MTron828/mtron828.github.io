Gu Zhou frowned. Just as he was about to say something, he heard Qiao Nian speak again.

“By the way, Gu Qi thinks that you’re his biological father. If he finds out about our relationship and that he has a stepmother, will he feel upset? Why don’t we hide our relationship for a while? We’ll say that we’re good friends. What do you think?” Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou intently with a smile in her eyes.

Gu Zhou didn’t speak immediately. His dark eyes were fixed on Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian felt a little uncomfortable under his gaze. She pursed her lips and asked, “Do you think my suggestion is okay?”

Gu Zhou nodded.

Qiao Nian gave a relaxed smile and continued, “Since you agree with me, I’ll get the butler to inform all the servants. However, I think you’ll have to speak to Grandma yourself.”

Gu Zhou frowned, a trace of coldness flashing in his eyes. He didn’t understand if Qiao Nian was really so open-minded, or if she didn’t care about him at all.

A woman who wanted to take the initiative to hide their relationship.

Who was he?

He was the only heir of the Gu family, the Second Young Master of the Gu family. Even if rumors of his short life and ugly appearance spread like wildfire, many people were still willing to marry him.

If he suggested hiding their marriage and Qiao Nian said that she wasn’t willing, he would have thought that it was normal. However, Qiao Nian was the one who suggested hiding their marriage.

She didn’t seem to mind at all.

Qiao Nian didn’t seem to notice the expression in Gu Zhou’s eyes. Seeing that he didn’t speak, she urged, “I still have to take care of Little Qi later. Should we do this?”

Gu Zhou was speechless. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Qiao Nian continued, “Children are fragile at heart. We have to take good care of him. You think so too, don’t you?”

Qiao Nian seemed to be eager to cut ties with him.

He seemed to remember that Qiao Nian had mentioned something about a year of marriage, but he had rejected her.

He couldn’t remember what was written on the contract either.

Gu Zhou felt his throat go a little dry. Qiao Nian’s fondness for Gu Qi seemed to exceed her ordinary self. He said in a low voice, “I’ll tell Grandma myself.”

A bright smile appeared on Qiao Nian’s face. Just as she was about to speak, she realized that something was wrong with Gu Zhou’s expression. She was worried that Gu Zhou’s third personality had appeared.

To be honest, she was most afraid of Gu Chuan.

“Gu Zhou, what’s wrong? Are you feeling unwell?” Qiao Nian frowned slightly. Had Gu Zhou really switched personalities?

If Gu Zhou really changed his personality, it would be troublesome.

In particular, the cold aura he exuded was similar to Gu Chuan’s.

If Gu Chuan came out now, should she strike first and knock Gu Zhou out and call Chen Qing over to help?

“If you’re not feeling well, then I…”

“I understand. I’ll make the arrangements.” Gu Zhou interrupted Qiao Nian coldly, looking up at her.

“Where’s Grandma?”

“Grandma already knows about him. She also knows that his family wasn’t happy. There’s something wrong with his mind. She will help.” When Gu Zhou said this, he felt extremely upset.

Little Qi’s childhood was very similar to his own. They both had an imperfect and flawed childhood.

Gu Zhou sighed heavily and said, “You’re right. If he finds out that we’re husband and wife now, he’ll definitely be even more upset. We’d better keep this a secret for now. When he’s recovered and his mental health has improved, we’ll tell him.”

Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief and said with a smile, “You really care more about him than his biological father.”

Gu Zhou was speechless.

Qiao Nian continued, “Then I’m relieved. I’ll go back to my room for a while. I’ll continue taking care of him later.”

With that, Qiao Nian turned to leave, but Gu Zhou grabbed her hand.
