804 The More You Say, the More You Lose

Qiao Nian didn’t reply. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Su Xue continued, “I began to rummage through your school bag, wondering if I could find some information. If I could send you home directly, your family might even give me some thank-you gifts. If I really can’t find them, I’ll get the police to help you find your family!”

Qiao Nian felt that this was something Su Xue could do.

“But there’s no information in your bag that proves your identity. There’s only a check for a million yuan and a letter. The letter says that if I accept a million yuan, I have to adopt you!” When Su Xue said this, she looked like she had given up.

!!

Qiao Nian’s expression changed slightly.

One million?

Could it be that someone had specially sent her to Soul City to find someone to adopt her?

She had been kidnapped then.

Who exactly had sent her to Soul City?

Was it her family?

Or a kidnapper?

Or was it her mother?

No, it was definitely not her mother. Then her mother would not have suffered from depression after she knew that she was dead.

Qiao Nian looked up slightly, her gaze landing on Su Xue’s face. She asked, “What else did the letter say?”

“Your birthday, and the words ‘Nian Nian’! That’s why we added ‘Nian’ when we named you!”

Qiao Nian’s frown deepened.

Twenty years ago, a million yuan was indeed not a small sum.

Someone had deliberately placed her at Su Xue’s door.

That meant that someone knew that she was in the Qiao family.

No wonder Su Xue didn’t dare to leave her behind and brought her back to the Qiao family.

Su Xue really wanted that one million yuan. If Su Xue took the money and left her behind, that person might attack Su Xue.

In that case, Su Xue must have known about this and taken her away.

This was just one of the guesses.

She wasn’t sure what exactly was going on.

Or rather, she had been sent to someone else’s house. She had accidentally walked to Su Xue’s house.

Nian Nian…

That person had actually left her name and birthday behind.

Why was that?

Qiao Nian’s frown deepened. Although she had obtained many clues from Su Xue today, these clues were a little too weak and couldn’t help her find the truth at all.

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian looked at Su Xue coldly and questioned, “Is it really just a million yuan?”

Su Xue had a bad feeling.

Qiao Nian was too smart. She had only told a small lie, but Qiao Nian had already discovered it.

In any case, only she knew what had happened back then. As long as she refused to admit it, Qiao Nian couldn’t do anything to her.

Su Xue said sternly, “It’s a million!”

Qiao Nian smiled gently and said, “Where’s the money?”

Su Xue frowned. Could it be that Qiao Nian wanted the money back?

How could that be? Once the money was in her pocket, it would be hers. She could never take it out again.

“This one million yuan was used up long ago when I raised you!” Su Xue said calmly.

“Is this money used up to support me?”

Su Xue was speechless.

Su Xue felt that Qiao Nian was too annoying. Most people would stop here and not mention it again.

Only this little b*tch in front kept mentioning it. She was so annoying.

Qiao Nian didn’t seem to see the hatred in Su Xue’s eyes. She said calmly, “A million yuan more than twenty years ago isn’t a small sum. Even now, it’s not a small sum. In terms of the current market, a million yuan is more than enough to raise a child to the age of 18! Not to mention the best food and drinks!”

Seeing that Su Xue’s face was turning paler and paler, Qiao Nian continued mercilessly, “When I was young, I didn’t have enough to eat or wear. You took a million yuan, but you didn’t take good care of me!”

“If it weren’t for me, you would have died in the wilderness long ago!” Su Xue retorted mercilessly.

Qiao Nian smiled gently and said, “I believe that if it were anyone else who took a million yuan, they would definitely raise me well and not throw me into the mountains and forests to fend for myself. After all, not everyone’s heart is black!”
