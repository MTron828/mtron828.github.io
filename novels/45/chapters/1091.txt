1092 Did He Kill Someone?

Only then did Qiao Shan come back to his senses. He subconsciously let go and saw Su Xue fall heavily to the ground. Her face was pale, as if she had already died.

This, this…

Had he killed someone?

Qiao Shan’s gaze moved away from Su Xue’s face and landed on his trembling hands. Could it be that he had really strangled Su Xue to death with his own hands?

Qiao Yu looked at Qiao Shan helplessly and hurriedly moved closer to Su Xue. He shook Su Xue hard and shouted, “Mom, Mom, wake up!”

At this moment, Su Xue was like a lifeless rag doll, without any reaction.

Qiao Yu’s heart skipped a beat.

Could it be that Su Xue was dead?

Realizing this, Qiao Yu’s heart was beating wildly, and his temples were throbbing.

Qiao Shan sat in his wheelchair and looked at the lifeless Su Xue. He was a little nervous. “Is… is she already dead?”

Qiao Yu frowned at Su Xue and said, “I don’t know either.”

Su Xue was dead!

When Qiao Shan realized this, he found it unbelievable, but also very happy.

For the past thirty years, he had been played by Su Xue like a fool.

Qiao Shan smiled coldly and murmured, “It’s good that she’s dead. Otherwise, she’ll embarrass herself outside. The heavens are truly merciful. They let her die.”

Qiao Yu didn’t have time to argue with Qiao Shan now. Every second was very important to Su Xue. He hurriedly picked Su Xue up and placed her on the bay window, swiftly opening all the windows.

The cold wind blew in, blowing away the air in the room and bringing fresh air.

Qiao Yu placed his hands on Su Xue’s heart and pressed hard, helping her with her cardiac resuscitation.

Qiao Yu didn’t dare to stop for a moment. As he did his CPR, he kept calling out to Su Xue, “Mom, wake up! Wake up!”

After an unknown period of time, Su Xue suddenly opened her eyes and took a deep breath. Then, she slowly heaved a sigh of relief.

Qiao Yu felt that it had been a long time since he had used CPR, but when he glanced at his watch, it had only been more than thirty seconds.

Su Xue blinked. When she saw Qiao Yu clearly, she was still a little stunned. She asked weakly, “Qiao Yu, I just…”

Before Su Xue could finish speaking, she heard Qiao Shan’s voice not far away.

“B*tch, you’re quite lucky!”

Su Xue suddenly sat up and looked at Qiao Shan, who was sitting in a wheelchair. Memories of Qiao Shan strangling her instantly surged into her mind.

She covered her neck with both hands and looked at Qiao Yu beside her in fear. Panting, she said, “Qiao Yu, something has happened. Your father has gone crazy. He wants to strangle me to death. Save me, save me!”

Qiao Shan looked at Su Xue hiding behind Qiao Yu. The image of Su Xue pretending to be aggrieved for so many years flashed in his mind. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

In the past, every time he saw Su Xue suffer, he yearned to help her solve all her problems.

But now, he only felt that Su Xue was disgusting.

How many thirty years could one have in one’s life? His most important thirty years had all been spent with Su Xue, but Su Xue had cheated on him for thirty years.

For the past thirty years, he had been played by Su Xue like an idiot.

“B*tch, get over here. Other than pretending to be aggrieved and fooling around with men every day, what else can you do? Come here. If I don’t kill you, I’ll really let you down for making me a cuckold for so many years!” Qiao Shan looked at Su Xue with hatred. If it weren’t for the fact that his legs were inconvenient now, he would have walked over and pulled Su Xue over!

When Su Xue heard Qiao Shan’s words, she turned pale with fright. She hurriedly screamed, “Son, you have to save me. If you don’t, I’ll be dead!”

Qiao Yu was now standing between Su Xue and Qiao Shan, facing him.

“Qiao Yu, this is a personal grudge between me and that b*tch. Get out!” Qiao Shan panted heavily, his entire body burning with anger.

Su Xue thought of Qiao Xin’s letter to Qiao Shan, and her eyes gradually dimmed. Her daughter had already betrayed her. Qiao Yu was the only one left.

Su Xue grabbed Qiao Yu’s arm and begged with teary eyes, “Qiao Yu…”

“You b*tch. Even now, you’re still using the same methods you used on your lover on your child. Aren’t you disgusting!” Qiao Shan interrupted Su Xue angrily. He hated it when Su Xue acted like a spoiled child.
