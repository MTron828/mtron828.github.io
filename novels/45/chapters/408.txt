Chapter 409: There’s Only One Bed

Qiao Nian wrapped herself in her clothes and looked up at Gu Zhou. Seeing that he was tired, she asked in confusion, “Why are you here?”

Gu Zhou did not answer Qiao Nian. His gaze landed on the corpse by the lake, and his eyes narrowed slightly.

“Didn’t Grandma say—”

“She didn’t fall and drown.” Gu Zhou interrupted Qiao Nian, his cold voice carrying a hint of intrigue.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in surprise. Puzzled, she asked, “How did you know?”

She looked down at the mess. The police had already carried the body into the police car.

Although she had guessed that there was more to Ah Miao’s death, she had no proof.

Gu Zhou’s thin lips parted slightly as he said, “I smelled some alcohol when I passed by just now. At this time, it’s impossible for a woman to be drinking by the lake outside.”

Qiao Nian instantly understood what Gu Zhou meant.

Ah Miao was Boss Jin’s lover. Logically speaking, she should be with Boss Jin now.

However, it was obvious that Ah Miao had been forced to drink and thrown into the lake as if she had fallen into it while drunk.

Qiao Nian’s beautiful fox-like eyes narrowed slightly, and she frowned. If she wasn’t wrong, Mr. Chen must have instructed his subordinates to do this. Just like before, he couldn’t tolerate a single grain of sand in his eyes.

Qiao Nian had to admit that Mr. Chen was the emperor here. He could do anything.

Seeing that Qiao Nian understood what he meant, Gu Zhou said calmly, “Go back and rest!”

Actually, Qiao Nian didn’t want to get involved in such matters either. She nodded and followed Gu Zhou to his room.

When Qiao Nian reached her room, she hesitantly took out her room card and tilted her head to look at the man standing beside her.

Seeing that Gu Zhou had no intention of going to another room, she had no choice but to open the door.

At this moment, Qiao Xin had just returned from watching the show on the first floor when she saw a man walk into Qiao Nian’s room.

She was slightly stunned. Although she did not see the man’s face, she was completely sure that this man was not Gu Zhou.

It had to be known that Gu Zhou was not in good health, so it was impossible for him to come here.

Therefore, Qiao Nian had already cheated on him.

Realizing this, Qiao Xin looked shocked, but she quickly calmed down. A smug smile appeared on her lips.

She wanted to capture this scene. When she returned to the country, she could tell Gu Zhou about Qiao Nian’s affair.

At that time, Gu Zhou would definitely divorce Qiao Nian, and she would be able to marry Gu Zhou!

She would ruin Qiao Nian’s reputation.

It was now or never!

The more Qiao Xin thought about it, the more excited she became. She quickly ran into the room.

Her room was only a wall away from Qiao Nian’s. After running back, she immediately carefully moved to the balcony of her room and set up a camera.

She knew that Qiao Nian had always been cautious, but these two people might just walk over to the balcony. She just had to wait quietly.

Suddenly, there was a sharp pain at the back of her head, and Qiao Xin lost consciousness.

Gu Zhou walked into the room with an indifferent expression. He looked around and stuffed his hands into his pockets.

For some reason, Qiao Nian felt a little uncomfortable with Gu Zhou’s arrival.

Just as Qiao Nian was about to break the awkward silence, she heard Gu Zhou say meaningfully, “There’s only one bed.”

Qiao Nian was slightly taken aback. She glanced around the room. There was everything, except for a sofa.

Qiao Nian’s last gaze landed on the large bed.

Although she had slept in the same bed as him, it was a little embarrassing for a girl like her to mention sleeping with him, so she asked, “Why don’t you get another room?”

“I have something important to do this time. It’s not convenient for me to show my face.”
