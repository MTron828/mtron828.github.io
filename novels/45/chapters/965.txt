966 Hell

Qiao Nian tried hard to remain calm as she followed Gu Zhou out of the elevator. She wanted to see what Gu Zhou was going to do today.

Perhaps she was just overthinking.

After the elevator door opened, Gu Zhou took Qiao Nian’s hand and walked towards the east.

Qiao Nian stepped on the marble in her high heels. She and Gu Zhou were alone in the corridor. She looked at the approaching door and felt as if she was about to walk into hell.

And now, Gu Zhou was leading her into hell.

Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou and saw that he was looking straight ahead. There seemed to be thick ink in his eyes.

She pursed her lips slightly and tried to retract her hand, but Gu Zhou tightened his grip on her.

She couldn’t break free from Gu Zhou’s grip at all now. She could only follow him to hell.

The path to hell was very difficult. It was clearly only sixty meters, but she felt as if she had walked for a lifetime.

In the end, Gu Zhou brought her to stand at the door of a suite.

She looked up at the suite’s door number. It read 1314.

1314. In Chinese, it meant a lifetime.

The meaning was very good, but to Qiao Nian, it was an unforgettable nightmare.

Six years ago, she had lost everything in this room.

Qiao Nian felt a little suffocated. All the blood in her body seemed to have frozen.

At this moment, Gu Zhou placed his hand on the lock. His fingerprint successfully unlocked it. With a ding, he reached out and pushed the door open.

Qiao Nian felt as if she had been struck by lightning. She stood rooted to the ground, unable to move.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian with a gentle smile, indicating for her to come in.

Qiao Nian stood rooted to the ground quietly. This suite was her nightmare. It had begun unluckily for her. She really didn’t want to go in again.

Just as Qiao Nian was feeling conflicted, Gu Zhou let go of her hand and picked her up in his arms. He led her in and closed the door.

Bang!

Bang! 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Bang!

Qiao Nian seemed to hear her violently beating heart. She was stunned. She stood rooted to the ground in a daze, not even remembering to struggle and escape.

Gu Zhou looked down at Qiao Nian, who was in his arms. Her palm-sized face was filled with fear and unease, and she looked like a helpless young lady.

“Nian’er, I’m sorry!” Gu Zhou apologized sincerely. He had wanted to apologize to that girl back then, but he had never found her.

Gu Zhou knew in his heart that every girl would be afraid when they encountered such a thing.

Even though Qiao Nian usually looked smart and calm, she was still an eighteen-year-old girl at that time. She still couldn’t accept the terrifying truth.

Qiao Nian’s beautiful fox-like eyes widened uncontrollably. She looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief. “Could it be that you…”

“I know that you were the one that night.” As Gu Zhou spoke, he carried Qiao Nian to the bed and placed her there. “I know that you were the girl from that night six years ago. I also know that you’re Gu Qi and Xiao Shi’s biological mother. You’re also the person I’ve been looking for these past few years.”

Qiao Nian was shocked!

When Gu Zhou admitted this himself, she felt as if her body had been torn apart and her heart had been seen.

She had always thought that she had hidden it well, but she did not expect Gu Zhou to have known long ago.

She lowered her head, not daring to look around. She didn’t want to stay in a nightmare. She wanted to escape this place and go somewhere else.

Qiao Nian had just stood up when she was pulled into Gu Zhou’s arms.

“Let go of me!” Qiao Nian reached out to push Gu Zhou away.

Gu Zhou hugged her tightly and rested his chin on the top of her head. He said in a low and hoarse voice, “Don’t leave…”

Qiao Nian slowly closed her eyes, unable to calm the anger in her heart.

“After that incident, I bought this suite and the entire hotel.” Gu Zhou’s low voice seemed to be filled with magic, gradually calming the anger in Qiao Nian’s heart. “I’ve been waiting for you here, waiting for you to come and look for me. I didn’t dare to look for you because I was afraid that I would ruin your reputation.”

Qiao Nian recalled what Lu Zhu had told her previously. He had said that Gu Zhou had been looking for her. He was worried that her reputation would be damaged, so he didn’t dare to make a scene.
