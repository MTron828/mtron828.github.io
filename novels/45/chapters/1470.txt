1471 Biting the hand that feeds you?

The president paused for a moment and continued, “Wright will deal with you unscrupulously!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

His words were filled with mockery.

A trace of a smile flashed in the President’s eyes. In a low voice, he pretended to be serious and said, “Wright is just the prince of the First Earl. If the First Earl and the Third Count join forces, do you think you’re a match for them?”

Without waiting for Gu Zhou to speak, he threatened in a low voice, “Even if you’re not afraid of the two of them, what about me? Previously, I discovered a cheap shot by the Gu family in Europe. I think you definitely don’t want all your efforts in Europe to go to waste, right?”

With a smile in his eyes, the President of Europe looked at Gu Zhou with interest.

It was easy for him to use the strength of a country to deal with the Gu family.

Gu Zhou’s pupils constricted slightly, and his voice turned colder. “So the President of Europe is someone who bites the hand that feeds him. He’s using the strength of a country to deal with the Gu family. Looks like you’re very afraid of the Gu family!”

The temperature in the room instantly dropped. The European president had not expected Gu Zhou to say such a thing. He thought for a moment before saying in a low voice, “In the face of a great enemy, the European royal family will unite against the outside world. Even if Lina knows my decision, she won’t say anything. After all, personal feelings are nothing in front of national matters.”

When Gu Zhou heard the President’s words, his expression had already turned completely cold. He said calmly, “I think the President might have forgotten something.”

“What is it?” The European President raised his eyebrows slightly.

“I’m from An City, and I’m from Country Z. Could it be that the President wants to start a war between the two countries?” As Gu Zhou spoke, he had a smile on his face, but it didn’t reach his eyes. “When the sandpiper and the clam fight, the fisherman benefits. The President should understand such simple logic!”

Although Gu Zhou was smiling, the President could see the coldness and killing intent in his eyes. The aura Gu Zhou was exuding made him tremble in fear.

The president knew in his heart that if he could not be friends with the Gu family, they could only be enemies. He trusted Lina also did not want to see this day.

The President looked at Gu Zhou with a complicated expression. After a long while, he said solemnly, “If you’re willing, as long as I’m alive, I’ll protect the Gu family.”

This was a promise the president had made to Gu Zhou. Whether he was the president in the future or not, the Gu family was safe in Europe.

The coldness in Gu Zhou’s eyes slowly dissipated, but no one could see his emotions clearly. He looked at the president in front of him and said, “The Seventh Princess is my wife’s friend. I can’t be enemies with her friend’s family.”

Seeing the calmness in Gu Zhou’s eyes, the President knew that he was not lying.

Long before Gu Zhou came to Europe, he wanted to rope in the Gu family in An City. However, he had never made up his mind, because the rumored Second Young Master of the Gu family did not have long to live.

However, this time, Lina’s illness made him realize that Second Young Master Gu’s health was much better than before. Moreover, the Gu family was unfathomable.

He knew all about the Gu family’s businesses in Europe, but the army Gu Zhou exposed today made him realize that the Gu family’s businesses he knew were only what the Gu family wanted him to know. He knew nothing about the hidden businesses of the Gu family.

The president looked at Gu Zhou in front of him happily. He reached out and patted Gu Zhou’s shoulder, saying politely, “Alright, it’s settled. I’ll go see Lina first!”

With that, the president left, leaving Gu Zhou alone in the room.

The door to the room had not been closed just now. Standing outside, Chen Qing could hear Second Young Master and the President negotiating. His eyes were filled with admiration for Gu Zhou.

Their trip to Europe this time was mainly to get close to the president. Originally, they were at a disadvantage, but the president took the initiative to express goodwill, and they instantly had the advantage.
