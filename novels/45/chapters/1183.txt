1184 Getting Out of the Car

When she first joined Chentian Film and Television, not only had Second Brother not helped her, but he had even stalled her progress!

Thank you readers!

They were clearly siblings. They had lived together for more than twenty years, but Second Brother wanted to deal with her like this.

What she had never understood was that in the entertainment industry, it was very normal to snatch other people’s entertainment resources. Why did Second Brother think that she had gone too far?

Could it be that Second Brother was still affected by that incident back then…

Song Yu stole a glance at Lu Nian and pursed her lips slightly. It seemed that Second Brother was not planning to forgive her.

Auntie Cao couldn’t bear to see Song Yu so sad, so she said earnestly, “Second Young Master, when I accompanied Sixth Miss to the production team previously, I heard from them that in order to play that female lead well, Sixth Miss lost ten kilograms in half a month. Everyone in the production team said that Sixth Miss was especially professional, but Sixth Miss kept a low profile and wasn’t willing to let the paparazzi expose this matter. She only wanted to speak with her work. I think Sixth Miss is still very talented!”

“This is just the basic etiquette of an actor. What’s so amazing about it?” Lu Nian asked, raising his eyebrows slightly.

Auntie Cao frowned and shook her head. “Second Young Master, you can’t say that…”

Song Yu looked at Lu Nian with teary eyes. She pursed her lips, her mind racing. Then, she looked at Auntie Cao and interrupted her. “Auntie Cao, stop talking. No matter who takes that role, they’ll do the same thing as me.”

When Lu Nian heard Song Yu’s voice, he frowned and said coldly to the chauffeur, “Stop the car!”

When the chauffeur heard Lu Nian’s words, he parked the car by the roadside.

Lu Nian opened the car door and got out.

Song Yu’s heart instantly felt empty. She looked at Lu Nian in a daze and asked with a trembling voice, “Second Brother, what are you doing?”

“I’ll take a taxi home.” With that, Lu Nian closed the door mercilessly.

The blood drained from Song Yu’s face, and her body trembled slightly.

Second Brother actually hated her so much!

He would rather take a taxi home than sit in the same car as her.

Qiao Nian was sitting in the car behind. When she saw Second Brother get out of the car, a trace of confusion flashed in her eyes. Puzzled, she asked, “Who was Second Brother in the car with just now?”

“Xiao Yu, Auntie Cao, and Butler Dong.” At this point, Su Yan sighed helplessly and said worriedly, “It must be because the two of them fell out again!”

In Qiao Nian’s opinion, Second Brother had a gentle personality and would rarely fall out with others. She asked, “Mom, what exactly happened between Second Brother and her? Do the two of them often fall out?”

When Su Yan heard Qiao Nian’s words, she shook her head and said, “Actually, I don’t know what happened between the two of them either. I once asked your Second Brother, but he was unwilling to tell me. If he’s unwilling to tell me, no one can ask.”

Qiao Nian smiled and nodded. She didn’t say anything else, her thoughts drifting away.

She felt that something else must have happened between Second Brother and Song Yu. Otherwise, Second Brother wouldn’t have embarrassed Song Yu in public.

Su Yan lowered her gaze slightly. Her mind was filled with what her teacher had said. She was very curious now. Who exactly was the woman her teacher was talking about? Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

That woman was quite capable. She could actually take Sugar’s blood!

She wondered if that woman would believe that her teacher was really dead!

Su Yan clenched her fists tightly. This time, she had to protect her daughter well. She would never let Sugar be hurt.

At the thought of this, Su Yan reached out and held Qiao Nian’s hand. She said gently, “Sugar, try your best to recall your memories of being kidnapped. If you can, we might be able to find that woman sooner.”

Qiao Nian naturally knew what Su Yan was thinking. She grabbed Su Yan’s hand and comforted her softly. “Mom, don’t be too nervous. I’ve already grown up and have the ability to protect myself. It’s impossible for that woman to let us be separated. I’ll try to recall my memories of being kidnapped, but I don’t think that woman will let me see her face!”

Su Yan nodded.
