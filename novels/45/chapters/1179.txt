The woman looked at Shen An with a complicated expression, as if she was confirming if Shen An was telling the truth.

Thank you readers!

Actually, Shen An was very flustered. He was very afraid that the woman would find out that Little Lu Nian was not dead. If the woman found out that Little Lu Nian was not dead, the two children and he would die without a burial ground.

Shen An was already so anxious that his forehead was covered in sweat. At this moment, the woman spoke.

“Are you sure you can convince the police and the Lu family that that little bastard is dead?” the woman asked.

“I’m 100% sure,” Shen An said firmly. He knew in his heart that the woman already believed his words.

“Is that little b*tch really dead?” The woman raised her eyebrows slightly and asked tentatively.

Shen An frowned and said coldly, “Do you think a three-year-old child can still be alive after her bone marrow has been extracted?”

“I don’t know about that. Previously, I did think that little b*tch was dead, but this doesn’t vent my anger. Dig her out now. I want to chop her into minced meat and feed her to the dogs!” The woman stared unblinkingly at Shen An and gritted her teeth. Previously, she had asked her subordinates to deal with Little Lu Nian, but no one had touched her.

She was a little worried that Little Lu Nian was not dead. She did not want that little b*tch to still be alive. If that little b*tch was still alive, her plan would not be able to be completed.

Shen An was so angry that his lips were trembling. He had never expected that this woman would actually be so cruel to a three-year-old child. He said coldly, “As long as you dare to destroy her corpse, I’ll definitely tell the police everything that happened today. I’ll arrest you at all costs!”

“So she’s not dead?” The woman said viciously. “In order to protect an outsider, you actually disregarded your own daughter’s life. Then meet your daughter in the underworld!”

“Aren’t you afraid that your daughter will suffer retribution for doing such a crazy thing to the corpse of a three-year-old child? I was the one who caused her death. I just want to make up for my mistake.” Shen An straightened his back and said coldly, “If you kill my daughter, your daughter will be buried with us!”

A trace of panic appeared on the woman’s originally calm face. She asked impatiently, “What do you mean?”

“A successful bone marrow match doesn’t mean that their bone marrows are exactly the same. After a bone marrow transplant, your daughter’s body will still undergo a rejection reaction. Without my medicine, she won’t be able to live for more than a month.” Shen An looked as if he was facing death calmly as he spoke, “My request is very simple. Don’t disturb Little Lu Nian’s corpse and let her reincarnate as soon as possible!”

“Bastard!” The woman smashed all the vases and glasses on the ground in exasperation. She quickly walked up to Shen An and grabbed his collar. “How dare you threaten me!”

“It doesn’t matter if my daughter and I die. I’ve already done something wrong once, and I don’t want to do it again. Unfortunately, your plan might be ruined! Your daughter is only three years old this year, and her life has just begun. However, she’ll end her life soon,” Shen An threatened lightly.

The woman’s face turned pale with anger. In the end, she didn’t send anyone to dig up the corpse.

She had no choice but to do as Shen An said. She asked to cut off her daughter’s arm and got someone to send it somewhere and set up the location of death.

The woman also let Shen An go according to the agreement. As long as Shen An kept his mouth shut and made everyone think that Little Lu Nian was already dead, she would let Shen An’s daughter go.

When Shen An returned, he saw Su Yan crying every day. He recalled Little Lu Nian, who was sleeping on the ground. There were several times when he almost told Su Yan everything he knew.

His thoughts were very simple. Although Su Yan was sad every day because of Little Lu Nian, as long as Little Lu Nian was still alive, everything could be discussed at length. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The police station and the Lu family thought that Little Lu Nian was already dead. That woman no longer monitored him, nor did she send his daughter back. When everything was settled, he drove to the Su family village.
