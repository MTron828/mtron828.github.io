“Really?” Xiao Bao raised his eyebrows slightly and asked pitifully.

Chang Feng nodded vigorously and said, “Of course. Your daddy is worried that you’ll be hurt.”

Xiao Bao still looked at Chang Feng worriedly and pouted pitifully.

Seeing Xiao Bao like this, Chang Feng felt as if his heart had been stabbed by something. He took a deep breath and smiled gently. “Uncle Feng was afraid that you would be hurt. Your father and I care about you the most. You’re our little darling.”

When Xiao Bao heard Chang Feng’s words, he looked up and met those clear and deep eyes. When those eyes smiled, they were like the crescent moon hanging in the sky, making it impossible for him to look away. The uneasiness and sadness in his heart disappeared.

Although Uncle Feng had already changed his face, his eyes were still so beautiful.

Xiao Bao smiled too, because Uncle Feng had also admitted that Mr. Chen was his “Daddy”.

Xiao Bao did not forget Chang Feng’s strange expression just now. He asked tentatively, “Uncle Feng, are you going to bring me home tonight?”

“Of course.” Chang Feng’s smile was as gentle as ever.

Xiao Bao’s uneasiness finally settled down. The discomfort in his heart had completely disappeared. He happily took Uncle Feng’s arm and said coquettishly, “Uncle Feng, I still want to eat egg soup tonight!”

“Okay.” Chang Feng looked at Xiao Bao’s bright face when he wheedled, and his heart ached even more.

Who knew how many years it would be before they met again.

Perhaps when they met again, Xiao Bao would have already grown up. He would not be as soft and cuddly as he was now, let alone hug and kiss him and Mr. Chen. He would not be as dependent on him as he was now. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Chang Feng felt as if a part of his heart had been hollowed out. He could understand the loneliness in his master’s heart very well now.

What made Chang Feng feel the most uncomfortable was that neither he nor his master could say goodbye to Xiao Bao properly. They could only use this kind of deception to trick Xiao Bao into leaving.

Chang Feng pulled Xiao Bao into his arms and slowly closed his eyes. He swallowed hard, holding back his tears.

Xiao Bao did not understand what Chang Feng was thinking. He hugged him obediently and asked softly, “Uncle Feng, what’s wrong?”

“Xiao Bao.”

Chang Feng did not answer Xiao Bao.

Xiao Bao looked at Chang Feng in confusion. He gently planted a kiss on Chang Feng’s face and said softly, “Uncle Feng, remember to pick me up!”

Remember your daddy and me.

However, he did not dare to say this. If he did, Xiao Bao would definitely be unwilling to leave.

“Remember what?” Xiao Bao tilted his head and asked in confusion. Seeing that Chang Feng was still hugging him, he asked, “Are you asking me to remember to have lunch?”

Chang Feng’s body paused for a moment, then he nodded. “Yes, remember to have a good lunch.”

Chang Feng let go of Xiao Bao and looked at his face. His eyes were wet, and he could not see Xiao Bao’s face clearly. “Hurry up and go. Your mommy is getting anxious.”

Xiao Bao looked into Changfeng’s eyes. “Uncle Feng, is there sand in your eyes? Shall I help you wipe them?”

As Xiao Bao spoke, he took out a tissue from his pocket and carefully wiped Chang Feng’s tears.

Seeing that Xiao Bao’s face was getting clearer and clearer in front of him, Chang Feng gave a gentle smile. “Hurry up and go!”

Only then did Xiao Bao put away the tissue and say happily, “Alright, I’ll go then. Uncle Feng, remember to pick me up tonight!”

With that, Xiao Bao ran towards Qiao Nian not far away.

Chang Feng looked at Xiao Bao’s back. When Xiao Bao ran up to Qiao Nian and saw that she had seen him, he turned around and left.

“Mommy!” Xiao Bao ran towards Qiao Nian. Perhaps it was because he wanted to see his mommy so much, so he no longer felt that his school bag was heavy. He shouted excitedly!

Qiao Nian hurriedly walked towards Xiao Bao and pulled him into her arms.

Everything around her seemed to not matter. At this moment, Qiao Nian could only feel Xiao Bao. She hugged Xiao Bao tightly in her arms, and the empty place in her heart was finally filled.
