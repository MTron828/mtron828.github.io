Chapter 1736 - 1736 Going Back on His Words

When she watched Chen Qing interrogate Wright just now, he looked like the Grim Reaper from hell, making her shiver.

However, Chen Qing was still very gentle with the princess.

Lina leaned slightly on Chen Qing’s shoulder and lowered her gaze. In a very weak voice, she asked, “Just now, you deliberately stabbed Wright’s hand with a knife. Is it because my hand is injured and you’re avenging me?”

When Chen Qing heard Lina’s words, his expression froze.

Actually, he didn’t understand why he had attacked Wright’s subordinate first. Every time something happened to Lina, his body wouldn’t be controlled by his brain and he would act without thinking.

Just as Chen Qing was figuring this out, footsteps came from outside the door, followed by a knock.

Knock, knock.

Chen Qing looked at the door warily and walked towards it.

Lina grabbed Chen Qing’s arm and shook her head gently. She said in a low voice, “Go. I can handle this myself.”

“I—”

Before Chen Qing could finish speaking, the door was knocked open.

Then, more than ten guns were aimed at the room.

When Lina saw this, her expression instantly darkened. She immediately stood up straight, and the weakness and helplessness from just now instantly disappeared. Her gaze landed on Wright’s face, who was standing at the back, and her eyes were filled with anger. “Wright, a leopard can’t change its spots. It hasn’t been long, and you’re starting to go back on your word. Do you still have any shame?”

Wright leaned against the guard beside him and his gaze fell on Lina’s face. His eyes were filled with sinister hatred as he said crazily, “A guarantee? Lina, your guarantee won’t take effect until eight o’clock. The guarantee hasn’t been sent out yet, right? Who knows that I’ve signed it?”

Lina’s pupils constricted. With a complicated expression, she said, “So you want to kill the three of us now and silence us?”

She pursed her lips tightly. She was the seventh princess of Europe, but Wright actually ignored her identity. He simply didn’t take her seriously.

When Wright heard Lina’s words, he sneered. He stared unblinkingly at Chen Qing, who was standing beside Lina, and enunciated each word clearly. “Kill Chen Qing.”L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

In Wright’s opinion, Lina and Via were just two weak women. He could control everything about them.

However, Chen Qing was different. Chen Qing was meticulous, skilled, and decisive. This time, Chen Qing had even embarrassed him. How could he be magnanimous enough to let Chen Qing leave?

He wanted Chen Qing to be torn to pieces.

In the chaos, gunshots rang out.

Instinctively, Chen Qing pushed Lina behind a chair and jumped down from the window to attract attention.

When the guards saw Chen Qing run out, they fired at him even more brazenly.

Bullets fell to the ground like rain.

Although Chen Qing was skilled, he only had a gun in his hand. It was impossible for him to fight those people, so he escaped by a small path at the side.

Wright and the guards also chased after him. He looked at the path in front of him, his eyes filled with a sinister smile. “Alright, let me do it!”

He had to kill Chen Qing with his own hands and make him suffer so much that he wanted to die.

Wright walked into the path step by step and asked the guards to guard outside.

The sky gradually lit up. Sunlight shone into the path, and one could clearly see a wall about thirty meters tall at the end of the path.

The wall was smooth. It did not look sturdy at all.

Wright looked at Chen Qing, who had nowhere to run. He smiled smugly. “Aren’t you very good at running? Run. Continue running. Why aren’t you running?”

When a guard saw the gun in Chen Qing’s hand, he said worriedly, “Prince Wright, Chen Qing still has a gun. Why don’t we do it? You…”

The guard was too embarrassed to continue. Wright was covered in injuries, and his hand, which was holding the gun, was still trembling. How could Wright be Chen Qing’s match?

Chen Qing stood rooted to the ground and looked coldly at Wright, who was not far away.
