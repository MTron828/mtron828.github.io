Chapter 219: Instant Noodles

“No. Let’s drive to a restaurant now!” Gu Zhou refused to eat instant noodles no matter what.

“But I’m so hungry. I can’t wait that long.” Qiao Nian disagreed, staring intently at Gu Zhou.

Chen Qing, who was standing at the side, saw that the two of them still intended on continuing their argument. Worried that Madam would get angry, he said carefully, “Second Young Master, it’s Madam’s birthday today. Why don’t we listen to her and eat instant noodles? Do you think that’ll be alright?”

When Gu Zhou heard Chen Qing’s words, he couldn’t help but frown.

Shouldn’t she eat something better on her birthday?

Instant noodles?

Wasn’t that a little odd?

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. Those eyes of hers were sparkling with anticipation, as if instant noodles were an especially delicious dish.

This was the first time he had seen Qiao Nian looking at him like that. He swallowed, then turned to look away indifferently. “Whatever!”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s reply, she immediately cheered up. She said to Chen Qing, “Chen Qing, hurry up and bring back the instant noodles!”

“Yes, ma’am,” Chen Qing replied, then left.

When Chen Qing returned, he was carrying a box of instant noodles.

Qiao Nian hurriedly followed Chen Qing towards the kitchen.

Chen Qing placed the box of instant noodles on the ground. Seeing Qiao Nian enter, he glanced at Gu Zhou, who was scowling not far away. He pursed his lips slightly. “Madam, it’s your birthday today. I’ll soak the instant noodles in hot water for you. Leave it to me!

“Soak in hot water?” Qiao Nian was slightly stunned.

Chen Qing nodded. “Yes!”

Gu Zhou, who was sitting at the side, looked at the two of them impassively. This was the first time he had heard of noodles being soaked in hot water. Weren’t noodles usually boiled?

Moreover, those were just instant noodles. They barely cost anything. How delicious could it be?

Hearing Chen Qing’s words, a trace of disdain appeared in Qiao Nian’s eyes. She said, “Soaking instant noodles in water is certainly one way to cook them, but they taste much better if you boil them. Just try my cooking later. You’ll definitely fall in love with instant noodles.”

Chen Qing couldn’t disobey Qiao Nian, so he could only agree.

When Chen Qing came out of the kitchen, he saw Gu Zhou standing by the French window, looking out at the scenery with a dark expression. He was exuding a cold aura.

He walked over with his head lowered and softly suggested, “Second Young Master, do you want to organize a birthday dinner for Madam?”

After all, it was only right for the wife of a powerful CEO to have a grand celebration on her birthday.

“There’s no need,” Gu Zhou said indifferently. His gift had already been delivered, so there was no need to specially prepare a banquet. He turned back to look at Chen Qing. “Have you contacted the former chairman of the Nianxing Group?”

“I’ve already found his private number.” As Chen Qing spoke, he showed Gu Zhou the phone number he had saved on his phone. “Do you want me to contact him?” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“There’s no need.” With that, Gu Zhou took out his phone and dialed the number.

As soon as he made the call, Qiao Nian’s phone began to ring.

Gu Zhou and Chen Qing looked at Qiao Nian’s phone in unison.

Chen Qing walked over. Just as he was about to hand the phone to Qiao Nian, he saw her coming out of the kitchen.

Qiao Nian walked to the sofa. Seeing that no one was answering the call for her, she said to Chen Qing, “Chen Qing, there’s some laver in the courtyard. Help me pick some.”

“Yes, Madam.” With that, Chen Qing walked out.

Only then did Qiao Nian pick up her phone and look at the caller ID.

It was Gu Zhou!

Strange. Weren’t they in the same room? Why was he calling her?

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion and saw that he was looking at her.

Suddenly, Qiao Nian’s eyes flashed. She looked down at her phone.

She remembered now. She had two SIM cards. One was for friends and relatives, and the other was for work.

Qiao Nian looked down at her phone. Gu Zhou had called her work number. She couldn’t let Gu Zhou know her identity at work.

She immediately turned the volume of her phone down to the lowest. Holding the phone to her ear, she spoke openly and naturally. “Hello, what’s the matter? Oh, okay, I’ll find out for you later. Thank you!”

With that, Qiao Nian put her phone into her pocket.

Gu Zhou looked down at his phone. The other party had not picked up, and the screen indicated that the other party was busy.

Qiao Nian pretended to be calm as she looked at Gu Zhou and said with a smile, “Just wait a little while longer. We’ll be able to eat soon.”
