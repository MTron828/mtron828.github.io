1328 I Can’t

Before Xiao Bao could finish speaking, Uncle Feng’s serious voice sounded in his mind.

“Don’t tell anyone your address!”

“Don’t tell anyone your address!”

“You’re not allowed…”

Xiao Bao immediately sat up straight and looked up at Qiao Nian. He shook his head vigorously and said seriously, “Mommy, I can’t tell you our previous address. Even if you ask, I can’t tell you.”

Seeing Xiao Bao’s serious expression, Qiao Nian sighed helplessly. Eldest Senior Brother must have told Xiao Bao this back then. Eldest Senior Brother had probably expected her to look for him long ago.

“Mommy is very worried about your Uncle Feng. He’s injured now. Aren’t you worried about your Uncle Feng’s injuries?” Qiao Nian asked gently. She was confident that she could fool those people and not cause trouble for Eldest Brother and Eldest Senior Brother.

When Xiao Bao heard Qiao Nian’s words, he shook his head vigorously and said seriously, “That won’t do either. Uncle Feng said that if I tell anyone, Daddy, Uncle Feng, Uncle Zhao, and Uncle Zhang will all be in danger! Moreover, Daddy and Uncle Feng have always asked Xiao Bao to be a good child who keeps his word!”

When Qiao Nian heard Xiao Bao’s words, she hesitated for a moment but didn’t say anything else. She couldn’t let her child be someone who was untrustworthy!

Seeing Qiao Nian frown worriedly, Xiao Bao smoothed her brow with his small hand and said softly, “Mommy, don’t worry. In the past, when Daddy and Uncle Feng were injured, Great-Grandpa had already saved them. As long as Great-Grandpa is around, they’ll be fine. In the past, when I had chicken pox, Great-Grandpa only inserted a few needles. I was fine.”

“Okay.” Qiao Nian smiled and nodded.

Xiao Bao was a caring man. He had learned to comfort people at a young age.

She pulled Xiao Bao into her arms and said gently, “Our Xiao Bao is really a good child. He already knows how to comfort Mommy. How awesome!”

With that, Qiao Nian moved closer to Xiao Bao’s face and kissed him.

“Mommy, Xiao Bao has always been a good child. Daddy said that Mommy likes good children. Of course I have to be a good child Mommy likes!”

Qiao Nian looked into Xiao Bao’s expectant eyes and nodded. She said gently, “Yes, Mommy likes Xiao Bao the most.”

With that, Qiao Nian planted a kiss on Xiao Bao’s forehead.

From what Xiao Bao had said, his great-grandfather’s medical skills were amazing. Eldest Senior Brother should be fine!

Qiao Nian relaxed slightly. She thought that if there was a chance in the future, she had to meet the Uncle Zhang Xiao Bao was talking about.

“Mommy, you didn’t come back last night. Have you been accompanying Dad?” Xiao Bao looked up from Qiao Nian’s arms and looked at her innocently.

When Qiao Nian heard Xiao Bao’s words, she gently rubbed his head and said gently, “Xiao Bao, do you want to see Dad?”

Xiao Bao shook his head and said seriously, “I heard from Fourth Uncle that Dad is sick and needs surgery. Mommy was accompanying Dad. She definitely didn’t rest well. Mommy, hurry up and sleep. When Mommy wakes up, we’ll go see Dad together!”

Qiao Nian looked at Xiao Bao in front of her and her heart warmed. Xiao Bao was clearly only six years old, but he was already so filial. Her eldest brother and Gu Yue had really taken good care of Xiao Bao. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Then will Xiao Bao sleep with Mommy?” Qiao Nian smiled at Xiao Bao and asked.

“No, I’m going to look for Fourth Uncle. I won’t disturb Mommy’s sleep,” Xiao Bao said in a childish voice.

Seeing how adorable he was, Qiao Nian reached out and took Xiao Bao’s clothes from the side. Just as she was about to put them on for Xiao Bao, she didn’t expect him to take a step back. She looked at him in confusion. “What’s wrong?”

Xiao Bao said in a childish voice, “Mommy, I’m already six years old. I’m already a big child. I want to wear my own clothes.”

Smiling, Qiao Nian handed the clothes to Xiao Bao. She thought to herself that if Xiao Bao couldn’t wear his clothes well, she would help him.

Xiao Bao unbuttoned his pajamas and said seriously, “Daddy said that we have to take care of ourselves. Putting on clothes is a small matter. I can do it well.”

Qiao Nian watched as Xiao Bao put on his clothes skillfully. Gu Qi and Xiao Shi’s faces appeared in her mind again.

Although these three children lived in different environments and had different growth experiences, they were all obedient and sensible.

How did she end up with three such cute children?
