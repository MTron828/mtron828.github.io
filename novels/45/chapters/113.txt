Chen Qing, who was standing behind Gu Zhou, was the first to sense the change in Gu Zhou’s aura. He couldn’t help but shiver.

$u Yan’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. He hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to speak up for him, and his lips curved up involuntarily.

So Qiao Nian still liked him.

The reason Qiao Nian didn’t confess her love for him the last time was probably because she was embarrassed!

$u Yan could understand. After all, girls tended to be shy. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

$u Yan gave Gu Zhou a challenging look. As long as his gift was opened in public, Gu Zhou would have no choice but to step aside!

suppressing the ecstasy in his heart, Su Yan instantly began to exude an air of superiority.

Qiao Xin stood uneasily beside Su Yan. No one else knew where the Suranne Grass came from, but she did. She had a bad feeling about this. Nervous, she gripped Su Yan’s hand tightly.

Su Yan was initially getting a little impatient, but when he thought about how Qiao Xin had given him the Suranne Grass immediately after she found it, he didn’t show it.

Director Lin reached out and pulled off the red cloth.

Just like that, the Suranne Grass appeared in front of everyone.

Most of the people who attended the opening ceremony today were from the medical field. They instantly recognized the rare Suranne Grass.

Someone in the crowd, who perhaps wasn’t as grounded as the others present, exclaimed loudly, “Oh my god, it’s Suranne Grass! It’s worth tens of millions!”

This feeling of astonishment instantly bloomed in everyone’s hearts.

“That’s right, that’s right. This is Suranne Grass!”

“Oh my god, Mr. Su is so generous. He actually gave Suranne Grass as a gift!”

“Tve only seen Suranne Grass in books. This is the first time I’ve seen a real pot of Suranne Grass. I wonder where Mr. Su got it from!”

“Mr. Su casually gifted this pot of Suranne Grass as a congratulatory gift. Perhaps he has other pots of Suranne Grass. This won’t do. I want to buy a stalk!”

The people around them were discussing spiritedly. At this moment, Director Lin was also astonished. For a moment, he didn’t know what to do, or what sort of expression to show.

$u Yan basked in the feeling of being the center of attention. He glanced at Gu Zhou, his eyes glittering with smugness.

However, Gu Zhou’s attention wasn’t on Su Yan. His gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. Slowly, he walked over.

“Mrs. Gu, you look beautiful today.”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion. She felt that Gu Zhou’s words sounded a little strange, almost as if they were carrying an undercurrent of danger.

Qiao Nian smiled. “Second Young Master Gu is as handsome as ever.”

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on the Suranne Grass. His voice was low, but his tone was firm. “That belongs to you, right?”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. Puzzled, she looked at Gu Zhou, not understanding how Gu Zhou was so sure that this pot of Suranne Grass was hers.

Gu Zhou seemed to be able to read Qiao Nian’s mind. His expression was indifferent. “Looks like the flowers and plants in our little garden at home are quite valuable after all!”

Qiao Nian smiled. She didn’t expect Gu Zhou to notice the medicinal herbs in the garden. It seemed that Gu Zhou was a very meticulous person!

“Then why are you here today?” Qiao Nian asked.

“To get back what belongs to our Gu family, of course!” Gu Zhou said self-righteously.

Qiao Nian didn’t understand at first. When she saw Gu Zhou staring at the Suranne Grass, she finally understood that Gu Zhou was referring to the Suranne Grass.

This Suranne Grass was clearly hers. What did it have to do with the Gu family?!

Gu Zhou walked over to Su Yan with a faint smile on his face. “Mr. Su, I heard that Suranne Grass is hard to come by in a hundred years. How did you get it? Do tell.”

su Yan knew that Gu Zhou was jealous of him. He glanced at Gu Zhou. When he met Gu Zhou’s dark eyes, a chill ran down his spine.

Su Yan had heard of Gu Zhou as well. It was said that Gu Zhou had never been a curious person.

Su Yan had initially wanted to get rid of Gu Zhou with a perfunctory answer, but onlookers had begun to gather around, all of them asking him how he had found the Suranne Grass as well..
