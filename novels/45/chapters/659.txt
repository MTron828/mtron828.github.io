Chapter 660: Messy Relations

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian stood rooted to the ground, frowning. She suddenly recalled how she had invited Su Sheng to the Gu family to treat Gu Qi.

At that time, when Gu Chuan came out, he even forcefully brought her back to her room and bit her mouth.

Could it be that Su Sheng had suspected her identity at that time?

Qiao Nian pursed her lips slightly and looked at Su Sheng with a complicated expression.

Could it be that Su Sheng felt that there was something ambiguous between her and Gu Zhou?

Even if she said it, what did it matter?

Wasn’t everyone discussing the score now?

“Miss Qiao, please tell everyone what your relationship with Mr. Gu Zhou is.” Su Sheng looked at Qiao Nian coldly, enunciating each word clearly.

A trace of disdain flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes. She said coldly, “What has my relationship with Gu Zhou got to do with what happened today?”

“Since you’re unwilling to say it, I’ll say it for you.” Su Sheng felt that Qiao Nian was still running away. In order to gain a good impression of Mr. Dong Hua, she also wanted to let him know that Qiao Nian wasn’t a good woman. “You’re Mr. Gu Zhou’s mistress!”

Mistress?

This was the first time Qiao Nian had heard this term. She found it a little novel, and her lips curved up involuntarily.

When Gu Qing heard Su Sheng’s words, her eyes were filled with confusion. Her gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face again. Seeing Qiao Nian’s calm expression, she instantly understood that Su Sheng must have guessed wrong.

Just as Gu Qing was about to remind Su Sheng, she heard Lu Nian speak.

“Did I ask you to speak now?” Lu Nian’s tone was not good. His face was dark as he questioned word by word.

Su Sheng looked at Lu Nian’s angry expression and suddenly realized something.

Mr. Dong Hua was also human. If Mr. Dong Hua knew that his woman was having an ambiguous relationship with another man, he would definitely feel very embarrassed. That was why he flew into a rage out of humiliation.

However, Su Sheng was puzzled. Why didn’t Mr. Dong Hua question Qiao Nian?

Before Su Sheng could speak, Gu Qing tugged at his arm.

“Alright, stop talking. Stop causing trouble!” Gu Qing said to Su Sheng with a frown. She knew that her junior sister was decisive and could distinguish between love and hate. When she saw injustice, she would definitely stand up and say a few more words.

However, Lu Nian didn’t look too good. If Su Sheng continued, she was worried that Lu Nian would hate Su Sheng in the future.

“You’re really thinking too much. I told you, she didn’t steal this score!” Lu Nian suppressed his anger. “Her relationship with Gu Zhou isn’t something someone like you can know.”

Su Sheng’s face turned pale as he looked at Lu Nian in disbelief.

Were all rich people so open-minded?

Even if Lu Nian knew that Qiao Nian was cheating on him, he wouldn’t care.

Su Sheng pointed at the small door and said, “The score should be in that room!”

Lu Nian’s anger was on the verge of erupting. He glanced at the door and looked at Su Sheng fiercely. “The surprise I prepared for her is behind that door. I’m just unhappy that she entered without waiting for me!”

Su Sheng was stunned.

She had never expected Lu Nian to prepare a surprise for Qiao Nian behind that door.

“But Qiao Nian and Mr. Gu Zhou clearly…”

Su Sheng found it difficult to breathe. She couldn’t speak and felt a little dizzy.

Why had things turned out like this?

What had she done wrong?

Lu Nian looked down at Su Sheng. His voice was cold and heartless as he questioned, “You used the filthiest of thoughts to falsely accuse a clean and pure girl. Is your heart made of dirty rats?”

Su Sheng swayed on the spot.

She had never expected her idol to say that her heart was made of rats and that it was dirty.

Tears welled up in Su Sheng’s eyes. She bit her lower lip, trying hard not to cry.

“Alright, let’s go!” Gu Qing said as she pulled Su Sheng away.

Su Sheng reached out and pushed Gu Qing’s hand away. She looked at Lu Nian with red-rimmed eyes and asked sadly, “She’s clearly a lewd woman. What’s so good about her?”
