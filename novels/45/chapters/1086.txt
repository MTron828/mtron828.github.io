1087 Gift

Qiao Xin turned to the side. She finally understood what it meant to be pitiful. There must be something hateful about her mother.

In the past, her father had always hit her mother. At that time, she had always felt that her father was like a great demon, wanting to hit his mother at every turn.

But now she understood that it was because her mother deserved a beating! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

She was woman who had betrayed her husband and schemed against her daughter. What right did such a person have to live?

!!

Qiao Xin took a deep breath, her gaze gradually becoming firm. She looked at Qiao Shan and said in a much gentler tone, “Dad, I left a gift for you in the drawer under the bookcase in my study. I wanted to give it to you myself, but I might not be able to do it now!”

Qiao Xin slowly lowered her gaze. She really wanted to see her father’s expression when he saw the gift.

Although his father would be very sad when he saw this gift, it was very important to her father.

Qiao Xin gave Su Xue a cold glance. She wondered what Su Xue’s future would be like.

When Qiao Shan heard Qiao Xin’s words, the guilt in his eyes grew more and more obvious. He was very touched.

So many things had happened to Qiao Xin, but Qiao Xin had even prepared a gift for him.

The more Qiao Shan thought about it, the more guilty he felt. He couldn’t help but say, “Qiao Xin, it’s all Dad’s fault! I’ll go take a look at the gift you gave me!”

Qiao Xin’s gaze fell on Qiao Shan’s face and she shook her head gently.

She now understood that her father had worked hard in the past. It was her father who had supported this family, but her mother had been dragging her father down.

“Dad!” Qiao Xin tried hard to put on a smile.

“I’ll visit you!” Qiao Shan looked at Qiao Xin with heartache, his eyes filled with worry.

Seeing that they were almost done, the police officer said, “It’s getting late. Let’s go!”

Pursing her lips, Qiao Xin followed the police officer out!

Qiao Shan hurriedly got the servants to push him out. Su Xue followed suit.

Qiao Nian looked at Su Xue and Qiao Shan’s backs and smiled coldly. “How hypocritical!”

“We’re done here. Let’s go home!” As Gu Zhou spoke, he reached out and grabbed Qiao Nian’s hand, interlocking his fingers with hers.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou’s face. Gu Qi and Xiao Shi’s faces appeared in her mind. She opened her mouth slightly.

Now that she had already acknowledged the Lu family, she knew that the people who had kidnapped her back then knew that she was still alive.

The matter with the Qiao family had been settled. Qiao Xin was about to go to jail and her schemes would stop!

However, she hadn’t found her child yet. At the thought of this, Qiao Nian’s heart tightened and she frowned.

The most important thing to her was to find her child. However, without any information on her child now, finding him was like finding a needle in a haystack.

Qiao Nian gripped Gu Zhou’s hand tightly, her expression turning serious. She said seriously, “I have something else to tell you!”

“Yes!”

As Gu Zhou spoke, he pulled Qiao Nian out.

Qiao Yu watched helplessly as Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian walked past him side by side. He looked at the two of them holding hands and slowly lowered his gaze, his eyes filled with disappointment.

Once upon a time, he had also thought of crossing his fingers and walking side by side with Qiao Nian.

However, those were just his extravagant hopes!

He missed Qiao Nian because he didn’t cherish her.

Some people could never be found again once they were missed!

He wasn’t lucky enough to cherish Qiao Nian…

Qiao Yu lowered his head and walked towards the ancestral hall in a daze!

After a few minutes, the servant pushed Qiao Shan back.

Qiao Shan’s thoughts were simple. What had already happened couldn’t be changed. There was no way he could get Qiao Xin out of prison immediately. The only thing he could do was make Qiao Xin’s life better in prison, or perhaps get her out of prison as soon as possible!

Qiao Shan wanted to go to the ancestral hall, but he remembered that Qiao Xin had said that she had left him a gift, so he asked the servant to bring him to Qiao Xin’s study.

Of course, he had to open the gift his daughter had left for him himself. Hence, he sent the servant out to look for the gift Qiao Xin had left for him!

Following Qiao Xin’s directions, Qiao Shan found a folder.
