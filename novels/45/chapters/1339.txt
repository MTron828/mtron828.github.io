1340 How Smart

In the car.

Xiao Shi sat down beside Qiao Nian. She asked Qiao Nian about what had happened in MY. In the end, she asked expectantly, “Mommy, are you the only one who came back?”

When Gu Qi heard Xiao Shi’s question, he looked at Qiao Nian with a burning gaze, also wanting to know Qiao Nian’s answer.

Qiao Nian looked into their expectant eyes. With a warm smile on her lips, she said softly, “Of course Mommy came back with someone else.”

Did she come back with someone else?

Xiao Shi covered her mouth happily with both hands, her eyes as bright as the stars in the night sky. She asked excitedly, “Mommy, did you find him?”

Although Xiao Shi’s words were a question, her tone was very certain.

At the thought of Xiao Bao, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but smile. She gently stroked Xiao Shi’s hair and said gently, “You’re so smart. You even guessed this!” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Xiao Shi gave a bell-like smile and said gently, “Mommy, how should I address him?”

“He’s your younger brother, Xiao Qi.” Qiao Nian’s lips curved up slightly as she said with a smile, “I believe you’ll definitely like him.”

When Xiao Shi heard Qiao Nian’s words, her eyes sparkled. She said happily, “Wow, then I’ll have two brothers.”

Qiao Nian nodded and said, “Yes.”

Xiao Shi was smiling happily when the smile on her face gradually disappeared. She frowned slightly and sighed sadly. “Mommy, I want two more brothers.”

“What?”

“Mommy has four brothers. Xiao Shi is Mommy’s darling. Xiao Shi also wants four brothers. That way, Xiao Shi will be the same as Mommy and have four brothers.” Xiao Shi looked at Qiao Nian seriously. Seeing that Qiao Nian was silent, he silently extended four fingers. “Mommy, if you think four brothers aren’t good enough, can I have five brothers?”

With that, Xiao Shi extended her last thumb and looked at Qiao Nian innocently.

Seeing Xiao Shi like this, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but laugh out loud. “Xiao Shi, it’s a pity that Mommy can’t give birth to a brother for you anymore.”

Although Xiao Shi was more sensible, there were still some things she didn’t understand. Puzzled, she asked, “Mommy, why can’t we have another brother?”

“If Mommy gives birth again, the child will be your younger brother or sister. You can’t have an older brother,” Qiao Nian said gently.

When Xiao Shi heard Qiao Nian’s words, she nodded thoughtfully and said with a smile, “Then I’ll tell Daddy to give birth to two brothers!”

Qiao Nian was speechless.

Lu Zhu, who was sitting in the front passenger seat, smiled when he heard Xiao Shi’s childish voice. This child was really too adorable.

Qiao Nian gently tucked Xiao Shi’s hair behind her ear and said with a smile, “Xiao Shi, men don’t seem to be able to give birth.”

“Why not?” Xiao Shi looked at Qiao Nian in confusion and said in a childish voice, “I’ve seen it before!”

“Have you seen a man give birth?” Qiao Nian was slightly stunned.

“Yes, Brother and I have both met.” As Xiao Shi spoke, she turned to look at Gu Qi. “Right, Brother?”

Qiao Nian saw Gu Qi nod.

“Where have you seen a man give birth?” Qiao Nian looked at Xiao Shi and Gu Qi curiously.

Lu Zhu also looked behind curiously.

“I saw it on television with Brother yesterday.” Xiao Shi’s clear voice rang out in the car.

Lu Zhu and Qiao Nian were both stunned. Neither of them was used to watching television. However, if men could give birth, the various media outlets should be competing to report on it.

Xiao Shi explained seriously, “Zhu Bajie and the others arrived on the Women’s Kingdom. At that time, he was thirsty, so he drank water. When he arrived at the Women’s Kingdom, his stomach grew bigger. Everyone said that he was pregnant!”

Lu Zhu looked at Xiao Shi’s cherry-like mouth as she spoke about the television drama. He couldn’t help but smile.

Children were really naive. They looked at things differently from adults.
