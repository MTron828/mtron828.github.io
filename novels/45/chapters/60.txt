Chapter 61: Provoked

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

When Qiao Nian heard Qiao Xin’s words, she casually picked up the list of guests and performers from the table, and began reading through it.

Qiao Xin was so anxious that she began breaking out in a cold sweat. She was genuinely worried that whatever trouble Qiao Nian caused would implicate Su Yan. She hurriedly said, “Sister, come sit here. I’ll give you my seat.”

Many university students had come to watch the graduation ceremony. Most of them hadn’t brought stools out of convenience, and were all standing around the hall. When they heard Qiao Xin’s words, they were furious.

Qiao Nian was a well-known figure in An University. She was a woman who had burned down the school building.

“What right does she have to sit in that seat? Those seats are reserved for outstanding students!”

“That’s right, that’s right. The school has already given her face by allowing her to enter campus. How dare she take the principal’s seat!”

“This is so infuriating. I’m going to get security to chase her out now!”

…

Shen Xing stood silently at the side, the corners of her lips curving up slightly. Her gaze fell on the back of Qiao Nian’s head. She had always wanted to seek an opportunity to deal with Qiao Nian, but she had never expected Qiao Nian to have already angered everyone before Shen Xing had done anything.

Shen Xing was the precious daughter of the Shen family. If not for the Shen name, she would not have had the chance to sit in the fifth row.

Shen Xing held her hands up around her mouth, forming a megaphone shape, and yelled at Qiao Nian, “Qiao Nian, your sister is calling for you. We know that there’s already something wrong with your brain, but is there something wrong with your ears too?”

Qiao Nian sat quietly. Without even granting Shen Xing a glance, she continued to peruse the program list she was holding.

Shen Xing had always been revered by her peers—she was used to being the center of attention, like the moon among a crowd of stars. She didn’t expect Qiao Nian to ignore her completely, and was so furious that she gritted her teeth.

“Qiao Nian, do you know that the first row is reserved for leaders of the school? Who the hell do you think you are? How dare you sit there? What sort of upbringing did you have?” Shen Xing was so angry that her face had turned red.

Qiao Xin instantly sensed the disdainful gazes landing on her. Her expression changed. She was the one who invited Qiao Nian here. Now that Qiao Nian had gotten into trouble, she would be humiliated as well.

Qiao Xin hurriedly stood up and looked toward the other students with an apologetic expression. She said guiltily, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry. Shen Xing, my sister isn’t doing this on purpose. Do stop speaking. I’ll talk to her properly. She’ll definitely understand!”

“Pft, she can’t even be bothered with you.” Shen Xing snorted. She said nonchalantly, “Those who don’t know the circumstances might think that she’s a corpse. There’s no reaction from her at all.”

At the thought of what had happened in the Shen family villa, Shen Xing yearned to tear Qiao Nian to shreds. “The two of you are truly an interesting pair. The older sister is arrogant beyond belief, while the younger sister steps out to apologize. Are you two putting on a show?”

Qiao Xin’s eyes turned red. Feeling wronged, she bit her lip and stood rooted to the ground, glistening tears falling from her face to the ground.

Listening to Shen Xing’s words, Su Yan saw that Qiao Xin was crying. He turned to look toward Shen Xing with a threatening expression.

Shen Xing lifted her chin and said nonchalantly, “Don’t look at me. I don’t know anything. Qiao Xin, you’d better get your sister out of here quickly. Otherwise, she’ll continue causing trouble!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The stage preparations had almost been completed. The graduation ceremony would start in half an hour.

Qiao Nian had initially wanted to ignore Shen Xing, but Shen Xing was simply too noisy. To block out the noise, Qiao Nian had begun thinking about medical prescriptions. She turned to look at Shen Xing, her bright eyes filled with coldness.

“Miss Shen, do you no longer want to graduate successfully?” Qiao Nian enunciated each word clearly. When she thought of how Shen Xing had tried to frame her that night, flames of rage burned in her heart.

Qiao Xin was stunned!

Shen Xing was also stunned!

The onlookers were all astonished.

They were all a little frightened by Qiao Nian’s words. However, when they recalled that Qiao Nian was mentally ill, they heaved a sigh of relief.

Qiao Nian was just a patient who had a mental illness. It seemed that Qiao Nian had already begun to imagine herself to be the principal. That was why she was acting so brazenly.

“She’s indeed a lunatic!”

“A lunatic like her should just stay in the mental hospital. Why let her out? Does she mean to scare us to death?”

“Everyone, be careful. If she takes out a knife and starts stabbing people, we’ll be doomed!”
