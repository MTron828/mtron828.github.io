1437 Nightmare

Qiao Nian breathed heavily. Tears streamed down her face, wetting her pillow.

When Gu Zhou came out of the bathroom, he saw Qiao Nian curled up in a panic. He frowned slightly and stepped forward to pull Qiao Nian into his arms.

“Nian Nian, what’s wrong? Are you feeling unwell?” Gu Zhou asked softly, gently patting Qiao Nian’s back.

“I’m fine.” Qiao Nian’s voice was teary. She took a tissue and wiped her tears. “I just had a nightmare.”

“Actually, dreams are the opposite.” Gu Zhou hugged Qiao Nian tightly and said gently, “The more pain they make you suffer, the better your life is in reality! According to our ancestors, if you dream that you’re dead, it represents you’re healthy.”

Hearing Gu Zhou’s low and hoarse voice, Qiao Nian’s uneasy heart gradually calmed down.

Gu Zhou was right. Everything that had happened just now was just a dream. It had not really happened.

However, when Qiao Nian thought of how unfamiliar Gu Zhou had looked at her in her dream, her heart couldn’t help but ache.

Only at this moment did Qiao Nian realize that Gu Zhou had long walked into her heart.

Qiao Nian leaned into Gu Zhou’s arms and gently rested her head on his chest. She slowly closed her eyes, preparing to get up after sleeping for a while.

Just as Qiao Nian was about to fall asleep, she recalled the dream she had just had. Puzzled, she asked, “I heard that when a person dies, their soul will reincarnate. Do you believe that?”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s question, he reached out and stroked her hair. After some serious thought, he said, “Perhaps there really is a previous life, but scientists haven’t verified this theory.”

Gu Zhou’s thoughts gradually drifted away. Sometimes, he would have a strange dream.

In his dream, he held Qiao Nian’s hand and walked into a church. Just as the two of them were preparing for a wedding, a group of armed criminals rushed into the room. Those people wanted Qiao Nian’s life.

Every time he woke up, he was always frightened. He was worried that all of this was not a dream, but an omen for the future.

When he fell in love with Qiao Nian, he had already asked Chen Qing to prepare everything for the wedding. Everything was almost ready for the wedding, but he didn’t dare to get married.

He was afraid that everything in his dream would happen. He was afraid that he didn’t have the ability to protect Qiao Nian and let her be hurt again.

Gu Zhou blinked and retracted his thoughts. He lowered his head and planted a kiss on Qiao Nian’s forehead before asking softly, “What dream did you have just now?”

Qiao Nian’s body stiffened slightly. She recalled everything that had happened in her dream and said uncomfortably, “I just dreamed that someone had died. I was very sad.”

She couldn’t tell Gu Zhou that she had dreamed that she was married to his brother. In her dream, his brother was her sweetheart. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

If Gu Zhou knew about this, he would definitely be very sad.

Gu Zhou did not ask further. He smiled and said, “I believe what the ancestor said is right. Dreams are the opposite.”

Qiao Nian smiled and nodded.

At this moment, Qiao Nian’s phone rang. She picked up her phone from the side. When she saw the caller ID, she was slightly stunned.

She had been thinking about her dream just now and almost forgot that she had already made an appointment with Lina to climb the mountain today.

Qiao Nian picked up the call and smiled. “Good morning, Lina!”

“Good morning, Nian Nian. I’ve already packed my things and am about to go out to look for you!”

“Then come over. I’ll be done soon!” Qiao Nian said with a smile. Then, she said a few more words to Lina before hanging up.

After hanging up, Qiao Nian turned to Gu Zhou and hurriedly said, “When Lina comes over later, ask Chen Qing to invite her in. You can’t let her wait for me outside! I have to get up and tidy up quickly!”

With that, Qiao Nian pushed Gu Zhou away and was about to go to the bathroom. She really didn’t expect Gu Zhou to still hug her tightly.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion and asked in confusion, “How can I wash up if you hug me like this?”
