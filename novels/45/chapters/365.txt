Chapter 366: Protecting His Wife

When everyone saw Jiang Qi’s expression, their hearts began to race involuntarily. They waited nervously for his answer.

Old Master Jiang Qi looked at everyone. After bowing gentlemanly, he said, “In my opinion, the stone wall painting on the left is the real deal.”

Everyone followed Jiang Qi’s gaze. The painting on the left was the stone wall painting Miss Song Yu had brought.

Qiao Nian frowned slightly, her eyes darkening. She pursed her thin lips.

A faint smile appeared on Song Yu’s face, exuding elegance and composure. She glanced at Qiao Nian, like a high and mighty queen glancing at her maidservant. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

With just one glance, Song Yu retracted her gaze. She didn’t take Qiao Nian to heart at all. She looked up at Old Master Jiang Qi and said politely, “Thank you so much, Uncle Jiang. You’ve worked hard to appraise it!”

Song Yu could guess Old Master Jiang Qi’s answer from the beginning.

Of course, Jiang Qi’s answer made many people present smile.

Song Yu’s fans, in particular, heaved a sigh of relief.

“Miss Qiao, do you have anything else to say?” Qin Lu looked at Qiao Nian sharply and sarcastically. “Mr. Huang Shi is a famous painter. I didn’t expect you to slander him like this. You’ve really insulted the stone wall painting!”

After Qin Lu said this, many people present began to feel indignant for Mr. Huang Shi.

...

“Miss Qin is right. If Mr. Huang Shi finds out that his stone wall painting has been insulted like this, he will definitely be especially angry!”

“Today’s charity auction is to build a school for the children in the poor mountain region. Miss Qiao actually brought a fake. This is simply shocking!”

“Everyone, don’t get too excited. I believe Mr. Huang Shi’s lawyer’s letter will arrive soon!”

“Miss Qiao, you should hurry up and apologize to Miss Song and Mr. Huang Shi. Perhaps Mr. Huang Shi won’t pursue your mistake on account of your young age!”

“That’s right. Hurry up and apologize!”

“Hurry up and apologize!”

…

In an instant, everyone in the banquet hall turned their attention to Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian slowly raised her eyes and looked at everyone indifferently. The way they looked at her was as if she had done something heinous.

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on Old Master Jiang Qi’s face and he interrupted everyone. “Old Master Jiang, what’s the reason for your judgment?”

Although Gu Zhou’s voice sounded very gentle, his eyes were slightly narrowed and filled with scrutiny. He was clearly questioning Old Master Jiang Qi.

Li Kun, who was standing at the side, frowned slightly. He had wanted to ask these questions, but Gu Zhou had beaten him to it.

Lu Nian stood indifferently at the side. There was no trace of panic on his face, because he could sense from Qiao Nian’s expression that she could handle this matter.

The smile on Song Yu’s face froze. She looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief, not understanding why Gu Zhou was still defending Qiao Nian.

Song Yu pursed her lips and said, “Brother Ah Zhou, Mr. Jiang is an authority in the art world. It’s really rude of you to say that!”

Song Yu’s flustered greeting immediately attracted the attention of the others.

Everyone looked at Song Yu and Gu Zhou curiously. Could these two be old acquaintances?

Mr. Jiang Qi waved his hand nonchalantly and said, “Miss Song, you don’t have to be so nervous. I approve of the painting you brought. I must have my own reasons.”

Song Yu’s uneasy heart gradually calmed down. She had never been worried from the beginning, because she believed that there was absolutely nothing wrong with her painting.

It was just because Qiao Nian had questioned her. She just wanted Qiao Nian to admit defeat.
