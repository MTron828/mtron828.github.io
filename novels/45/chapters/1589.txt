Chapter 1590 Some Trouble

When the president heard Qiao Nian's words, he looked into her eyes seriously. Seeing that she was honest, he pursed his lips slightly and sighed heavily. He murmured, "Even if I want to, I can't do it."

A trace of surprise flashed in Qiao Nian's eyes. Although the president hadn't made it clear, she could vaguely sense that he couldn't bring Shen Mei back to An City because of something.

Just as Qiao Nian was about to ask another question, she heard the president say, "The court session is almost ready. I heard that Cui Qi hasn't spoken yet."

"Cui Qi is indeed a little troublesome." Qiao Nian frowned slightly. She thought of Annie's face and pursed her lips slightly. "Even if Cui Qi doesn't speak, what Annie has done is already set in stone. Those crimes shouldn't be light. It depends on Earl Mark's response. Whether he appears in court or not will determine our reaction."

The president nodded gently.

He wanted to wait until all the evidence had been gathered before the court session, but Mark couldn't wait to get the court session started. He had no choice. After all, Mark had the right to speak there.

…

Lina walked to the entrance of the palace and saw Aisha getting out of the car in a gown.

Aisha was Earl Harry's daughter. Many of Earl Harry's businesses were endorsed by Aisha. She probably had to attend some event to wear a gown.

Aisha was wearing a ten-carat diamond necklace around her neck. She walked up to Lina in high heels studded with diamonds and said arrogantly, "Lina, I'm here to tell you good news today."

When Lina heard Aisha's words, she pursed her lips slightly and said, "Some things can just be said over the phone."

She had to accompany her mother and deal with Annie's court session. How could she have time to chat with Aisha?

"No, no, no." Aisha shook her hand gently, still wearing a diamond ring the size of a pigeon's egg. She stared unblinkingly at Lina in front of her, her red lips curving up slightly as she said happily, "I want to tell you in person and make you give up. That way, you'll never miss my man again!"

"Your man?" Lina had a bold guess, but she didn't show it on her face.

Could it be that Aisha and Wright were getting engaged?

Aisha said smugly, "Wright proposed to me yesterday and I've already agreed. Lina, give up in the future. Don't even think about snatching this man from me. Wright is mine! I'm getting engaged to him today!"

"Are you really going to be with Wright?" Lina asked uneasily, frowning slightly. Her gaze fell on Aisha's face.

"Lina, you previously said that you didn't like Wright. I'm telling you now that Wright and I are getting engaged. Look at how dejected you are!" Aisha had specially come here to see Lina dejected. In her high heels, she walked around Lina and continued, "Lina, it doesn't feel good to have your sweetheart snatched away, right? I wanted to tell you about this yesterday, but I was too busy yesterday."

With every word Aisha said, she saw Lina's expression worsen. She chattered, "After all, Wright really loves me too much. He took me to the Ferris wheel and we spent the night in bed. I really didn't want to get up today, but in order to share this good news with you, I specially came to look for you."

Lina looked at Aisha's happy expression and knew that Aisha and Wright were definitely engaged. If that was the case, it meant that Mark and Harry had joined forces.

Originally, his father, Harry, and Mark had formed a tripartite formation. If those two families joined forces, his father would be in an even weaker position.

Could this be a special move Mark had taken to save Annie?

Lina smiled and said politely, "Congratulations, Aisha. You've gotten what you wanted!"

"Congratulating me?" Aisha smiled coldly and asked, "Lina, are you really congratulating me, or are you planning to snatch my man away behind my back?"

Aisha pursed her lips and stared at Lina with a complicated expression.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com
