1422 How Handsome

Chen Qing and Su Han were in the car in front. Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian got out of the luxury car behind.

The four of them walked into the hotel together.

Those who could enter this hotel were either rich or noble. Almost everyone was dressed to the nines. It was said that the European President often received foreign guests in this hotel.

Qiao Nian looked at the signboard of this hotel and was slightly stunned. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Generally speaking, relatives would not choose such a hotel when they met. This kind of hotel gave off an unfamiliar feeling. One had to know that such an occasion was meant to receive outsiders.

Qiao Nian was wearing a gold one-shouldered evening gown, revealing her sexy collarbone on the left. Her slightly curled black hair fell behind her, like seaweed in the deep sea.

Her and Gu Zhou’s appearance instantly attracted everyone’s attention.

“Oh my god, that pair is so beautiful.”

“That Asian man’s facial features are really too well-defined. He looks similar to our European men.”

“I heard that Asians have a magical immortality. They age especially slowly. If only I could marry an Asian man. That way, I can give birth to a good-looking and immortally young child.”

“Can’t you see that he already has company?”

“Hmph, there will definitely be other single men.”

…

Qiao Nian didn’t listen to them. She was conflicted about what kind of person Gu Zhou’s father, Gu Ting, was.

When they arrived at the restaurant on the second floor, Gu Zhou said to Chen Qing and Su Han behind him, “You don’t have to follow us. Find a seat yourself. I’ll contact you when it’s over.”

With that, Gu Zhou glanced at Chen Qing.

Chen Qing had been by Gu Zhou’s side for a long time. The moment he met Gu Zhou’s gaze, he knew what he meant. He hurriedly nodded and agreed. “Okay.”

With that, Chen Qing and Zhang Han walked towards an empty table in another direction.

Qiao Nian followed Gu Zhou towards the dining table by the window.

There were many nobles in this restaurant. When Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian appeared at the airport, many people saw them and were all starstruck.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on a middle-aged man not far away. The man was wearing a white shirt, a black suit jacket, and a dark green tie.

At this moment, he was holding a glass of red wine and looking out of the window.

His side profile was almost identical to Gu Zhou’s.

Gu Ting didn’t look much different from in the photo. However, there were more traces between his eyebrows, and his eyes were more mature and steady.

Gu Zhou also saw Gu Ting. The first reaction in his mind was that when Bai Hui saw Qiao Nian, she couldn’t help but grip Qiao Nian’s hand tightly.

Gu Ting and Gu Zhou seemed to have a telepathic connection. When Gu Zhou saw Gu Ting, Gu Ting happened to look at him as well.

Qiao Nian noticed that Gu Ting glanced at Gu Zhou before his gaze fell on her.

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze slightly. She could still feel Gu Ting’s gaze.

About five seconds later, she felt the gaze on her disappear.

Qiao Nian looked up and saw that Gu Ting had already put down the wine glass in his hand. He stood up and walked towards them.

When Gu Ting walked up to Gu Zhou, he reached out and patted his shoulder. “You’re here.”

“Dad.” Gu Zhou’s tone was cold and distant, mixed with a trace of politeness.

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou call her that, she greeted, “Dad.”

She stood there calmly, waiting for Gu Ting’s reaction.

Gu Ting’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. There was a hint of a smile in his eyes, and his voice was much gentler. “Come and sit.”

Even though Gu Ting had said so, Qiao Nian still felt his imposing aura.

Perhaps it was because she had first thought that Gu Ting was a serious person when she saw his wedding photo.

Qiao Nian nodded slightly. She followed Gu Zhou to Gu Ting’s original table and sat down.

Gu Ting sat directly opposite Gu Zhou, and Qiao Nian sat close to Gu Zhou.

In the past, Gu Zhou had nothing to say to Gu Ting. Now, he also didn’t know what to say. He lowered his head and helped Qiao Nian wipe her utensils.

Gu Ting looked at Gu Zhou, who was sitting opposite him. For a moment, he didn’t know what to say.

The atmosphere at the dining table gradually became awkward.
