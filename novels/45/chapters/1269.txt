1270 Something’s Wrong

At this moment, Gu Qi was controlling the game hero to return to the city to heal. His gaze landed on the “Baby Xiao Bao” who had just died. Puzzled, he asked, “Mommy, who’s Baby Xiao Bao?”

“Just now, you asked me to investigate him. Only then did I know that he was my Eldest Senior Brother. He knew that you were playing games with Xiao Shi and wanted to add you as friends, but you rejected him.”

Xiao Shi was sitting beside Gu Qi, playing games. When she heard the words “Eldest Senior Brother”, she was immediately excited.

She still remembered the first time she had pretended to be her brother to come to the Gu family. At that time, Mommy had told her a story that mentioned “Eldest Senior Brother”.

“Mommy, is this Eldest Senior Brother the Eldest Senior Brother who almost ate mud balls?” Xiao Shi asked with a smile.

When Qiao Nian heard Xiao Shi’s words, her lips curved up slightly. “Yes!”

Xiao Shi smiled and said, “Mommy, I’ll unblock Eldest Uncle later and add him as a friend!”

Gu Qi looked at the Xiao Bao who had just revived in the spring and frowned. Puzzled, he asked, “Mommy, I think something’s wrong.”

“What’s wrong?”

“If he’s your Eldest Senior Brother, then when he added me as a friend, he could have said that he was Mommy’s friend. However, when he sent me a message, he called me Brother.” Gu Qi had a photographic memory. He would never make a mistake.

“After this round is over, I’ll ask around and hang up!” Qiao Nian frowned. She had a strange feeling. Seeing the support following obediently beside her, she recalled that the support had begun to dance as soon as the game began.

Eldest Senior Brother was already an adult. How could he do such a childish thing?

Qiao Nian’s frown deepened. Even if Eldest Senior Brother didn’t know how to play games, he wouldn’t rush to die so easily. Wasn’t it good to hide under the tower and wait strategically?

After Qiao Nian finished this game, she wanted to contact Eldest Senior Brother again and ask him clearly, but she hesitated.

Eldest Senior Brother had not told the truth just now. Did that mean that Eldest Senior Brother did not want her to know?

“Nian’er.”

“Hm?”

“I don’t think the ID ‘Baby Xiao Bao’ is Chang Feng’s style. What do you think?” Gu Zhou said.

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, her heart jumped to her throat. She nodded in agreement. “I think so too.”

“Maybe a child is playing the game?”

Qiao Nian looked at Xiao Bao’s tragic results and gasped. Most children were lousy at games. Could it be that the person operating this account was really a child?

“Could it be that Eldest Senior Brother has already gotten married and had children?” Qiao Nian frowned, then shook her head. “That’s not right. If Eldest Senior Brother has really gotten married and had children, he would definitely tell me. Moreover, what he and your brother are doing now is very dangerous. How can he get married and have children at this time?”

“I’m not sure,” Gu Zhou said calmly. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Gu Zhou could sense that the person behind “Baby Xiao Bao” was a child. His sixth sense could not be wrong. This child was the child Chang Feng wanted to protect.

However, Gu Zhou couldn’t understand why this child wanted to add Gu Qi and Xiao Shi.

“If Eldest Senior Brother doesn’t want to say it, he definitely won’t.” Qiao Nian pursed her lips, her eyes suddenly lighting up. She continued, “I’ll investigate it myself!”

Gu Zhou nodded.

This round was about to end. Worried that “Baby Xiao Bao” would go offline, Qiao Nian suggested another round.

The four of them began to team up again and started another round.

…

Xiao Bao sat beside Chang Feng and smiled at his cell phone game. He said happily, “Uncle Feng, I’ve finally won one round. Moreover, Mommy wants to play games with me again!”

“Yeah.”

“Mommy is so gentle. When I was about to be killed by the enemy, Mommy even saved me!” Xiao Bao said excitedly.

“Yes.”

“Mommy must want to teach me how to play the game well. I have to work hard to get ahead this time!” Xiao Bao said confidently.

…

Qiao Nian had to investigate Baby Xiao Bao and didn’t have time to play games, so she handed the phone to Gu Zhou. “Help me play the game. I’ll use the computer to investigate his situation.”

Gu Zhou looked at the screen of his phone and said hesitantly, “I’ve never played…”

He didn’t even know how to play this game.

“It’s fine. Just do as you please. Anyway, Xiao Qi plays well. Don’t worry!” Qiao Nian comforted him and turned around to take the notebook out of the case.
