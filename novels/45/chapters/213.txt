Chapter 214: His Token of Goodwill

“You didn’t do anything wrong,” Qiao Nian said, enunciating each syllable clearly.

“Then why is Nian Nian poking Zhou Zhou with a needle?” Gu Zhou’s tears were about to fall as he said this.

Qiao Nian really didn’t want to see Gu Zhou cry again. She said as gently as she could, “I’m doing this to treat your illness!”

Gu Zhou gazed at Qiao Nian’s face and bit his lip. Shaking his head, he said unhappily, “Zhou Zhou’s not sick. Zhou Zhou won’t get an injection!”

“This isn’t an injection,” Qiao Nian explained patiently.

“This is a needle!” Gu Zhou said with certainty.

Qiao Nian really didn’t know how to communicate with Gu Zhou any further. She was worried that if she inserted a needle without Gu Zhou’s permission, she would frighten him. If Gu Zhou changed into another personality, they would be in greater trouble.

Chen Qing came out of the bathroom and saw Gu Zhou sitting obediently on a chair, looking at Qiao Nian. His heart began to race. For some reason, he sensed that he might be killed and silenced in the future.

Heavens, someone save him!

“Madam, the bathtub is ready.” Chen Qing lowered his head.

“Chen Qing, take Second Young Master to the bathroom!”

Chen Qing nodded and walked up to Gu Zhou. He reached out to help Gu Zhou up, but Gu Zhou dodged.

Chen Qing’s hand hovered awkwardly in midair.

“Nian Nian, Zhou Zhou doesn’t want Chen Qing to help him.” Pouting, Gu Zhou looked up at Qiao Nian, complaining unhappily!

At this moment, it was as if a thousand needles were pricking Chen Qing’s heart. He didn’t know if he should continue trying to help Gu Zhou up.

Second Young Master, I’ve been by your side for more than twenty years.

Why do you still dislike me?

Chen Qing was heartbroken.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face. In a gentle voice, she coaxed, “Be good. Let Chen Qing help you into the bathroom, okay?”

Gu Zhou shook his head, tears welling up in his eyes. “Zhou Zhou wants Nian Nian to bring him there!”

Qiao Nian really wanted to cry. If she didn’t agree, Gu Zhou would probably burst into tears again.

Alright, it was just helping Gu Zhou to the bathroom anyway.

Qiao Nian helped Gu Zhou towards the bathroom, completely ignoring Gu Zhou’s gaze.

When she entered the bathroom, Qiao Nian saw that the bathtub was about two-thirds full. Placing her hand in the water to test the temperature, she put in the medicine she had prepared for Gu Zhou. Only then did she turn to glance at Gu Zhou. “Take a bath yourself. I’ll wait for you at the door.”

“Okay,” Gu Zhou agreed obediently.

Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. Fortunately, Gu Zhou was no longer making a fuss about her bathing him. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Chen Qing had been guarding the bathroom door. Seeing Qiao Nian walk out, he lowered his voice and asked, “Second Young Madam, how is Second Young Master now?”

Qiao Nian’s eyes were solemn as she said seriously, “I can’t be sure now. It looks a little like a kind of illness I’ve seen before, but I still have to monitor his symptoms.”

“Then when will he recover?” Chen Qing’s heart was already in his throat.

“We’ll need to monitor him before we’ll know.” Qiao Nian frowned. She hoped that Gu Zhou would recover soon.

He was such an outstanding person. It wasn’t right for him to spend the rest of his life like this.

Chen Qing grew even more anxious.

Qiao Nian had only heard about a similar illness from her grandfather. If her grandfather were here, he would definitely be able to treat Gu Zhou.

“Don’t let him be exposed to the wind in the future.” Looking at Chen Qing, Qiao Nian explained, “By nature, he has a cold constitution, and his health has also suffered greatly. As a result, his body is especially weak. Even if the weather isn’t cold now, he shouldn’t be exposed to the wind for too long.”

When Chen Qing heard Qiao Nian’s words, his eyes filled with self-reproach.

It was all his fault.

If he had not suggested coming here to celebrate Second Young Madam’s birthday, Young Master would not have been exposed to the wind, much less fall ill and become like this.

Previously, he did not know what birthday gift Second Young Master had prepared for Second Young Madam. He only knew that Second Young Master had hired someone to specially prepare it half a month in advance.

Today, he had retrieved the gift on Second Young Master’s orders.

Chen Qing thought of how Second Young Master had smashed everything in sight when his illness flared up. Yet, he had controlled himself and placed the crystal cup carefully on the table, undamaged.

Second Young Master really cared about Second Young Madam.

Suddenly, Gu Zhou’s scream came from the bathroom.

“Ah!”

Chen Qing acted before he thought. In an instant, he pushed the door open and walked in.

Worried about Gu Zhou, Qiao Nian looked in as well.

However, both of them were stunned by what they saw.
