Chapter 594: Keep a Low Profile

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Although Chen Qing was not the Gu family’s private chauffeur, he was Gu Zhou’s chauffeur. Poor Chen Qing. After returning from MY, he did not rest much and was forced to be a chauffeur again.

Qiao Nian looked at the Bentley in front of her and frowned slightly. “Can we keep a low profile?”

If she drove this car out, it would probably attract a lot of attention. She didn’t like to be high-profile to begin with.

“Then I’ll go change to another car now.” With that, Chen Qing drove away. In less than two minutes, a BMW drove out of the Gu family’s garage.

Qiao Nian’s frown deepened. This car was much more low-profile than the limited edition Bentley, but it was still quite high-profile. “Why do you usually drive when you go to the market to buy groceries?”

“This is the one,” Chen Qing said honestly, his expression calm. He didn’t understand why Qiao Nian thought this car was high-profile.

Qiao Nian looked down at her phone. It was getting late. It was almost time for her appointment with her brother. She should leave.

“This one will do,” Qiao Nian said perfunctorily. The dissatisfaction on her face was obvious.

Chen Qing smiled and hurriedly opened the car door.

After Qiao Nian got into the car, Chen Qing swiftly closed the door and quickly walked to the driver’s seat. “Second Young Madam, where are you going?”

“Yongan Building.” As Qiao Nian spoke, she recalled how Gu Qi had acted in front of outsiders. She couldn’t help but frown.

He was a three-year-old child but his father was hospitalized, and his mother’s whereabouts were unknown. He would be so depressed that he couldn’t sleep at night because of other matters.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on the window. Her eyes were filled with frustration as she sighed helplessly. She only hoped that Gu Qi would recover soon.

“Does Gu Qi usually not speak much?” Qiao Nian felt that Chen Qing must know Gu Qi well, so she asked.

“Yes, Little Master wasn’t like this in the past either. He knew how to talk and laugh. He had taken his nanny with him to study overseas until Second Young Master helped change his nanny to someone called Zhang Yi. We never expected Zhang Yi to have designs on Second Young Master. She hit and scolded Little Master, and even had the delusion of marrying Second Young Master.”

Hearing Chen Qing’s words, Qiao Nian was completely certain that Gu Qi had become like this because of the nanny Gu Zhou had invited over. Her expression instantly turned cold. “Didn’t he investigate thoroughly when he sent her over?”

“Zhang Yi is the nanny of Second Young Master’s teacher. She used to work diligently. I didn’t expect her to have other thoughts.”

“Doesn’t Gu Qi’s biological father care at all?” Qiao Nian’s expression was dark, her eyes filled with coldness.

“He’s in a coma. He’s still overseas. I can’t do anything about him,” Chen Qing stammered.

At that time, Second Young Master was indeed in such a state. Later on, even when he regained consciousness, he would occasionally fall ill. This…

Chen Qing sighed helplessly in his heart. Sigh, now that he thought about it, it really hadn’t been easy for Little Master to survive until now.

Was he unconscious?

Qiao Nian frowned slightly. The adult was unconscious. Indeed, he couldn’t take care of the child.

Qiao Nian felt a little angry, but she couldn’t vent her anger. She could only sigh heavily.

Soon, they arrived at Yongan Building. Chen Qing stopped the car and unbuckled his seatbelt. Just as he was about to get out of the car with Qiao Nian, he heard her say, “You don’t have to follow me. Go back and take care of your Second Young Master. It won’t be good if his other personalities run out and scare Gu Qi.”

Chen Qing thought about the personality of Zhou Zhou in Second Young Master’s body. He thought that this personality was very gentle and should not scare Gu Qi. “Second Young Madam, let me accompany you.”

“The third personality in his body is very dangerous. If you have nothing to do, stay by his side. Otherwise, he might do something dangerous.” Qiao Nian didn’t want Gu Qi to be hurt again. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Chen Qing was slightly stunned. His pupils gradually dilated, and he began to doubt his ears. “Second Young Madam, did you just say that there are two personalities in Second Young Master’s body?”

“I’ve seen two of them. One of them is very dangerous.” Qiao Nian’s expression was grim. With that, she got out of the car and walked towards the entrance of Yongan Building.

Chen Qing sat in the driver’s seat, his ears filled with Qiao Nian’s words. His brow furrowed deeper and deeper. Second Young Master’s illness seemed to be getting worse.

Chen Qing was about to start the car and head back when he saw a car parked in the parking space opposite him. The car looked very familiar.

When Lu Zhu and a young and beautiful woman in a white suit got out of the car, Chen Qing finally came back to his senses.
