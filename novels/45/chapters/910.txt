911 Biological Mother

He liked his mommy. He wanted her to smile at him, think about him and stand in front of him and protect him every time.

Gu Qi’s gaze fell on the dates of the two appraisal reports. When he saw that the date was early this morning, he was stunned.

Gu Qi silently placed the two appraisal reports back on the ground and pretended not to see them.

So Mommy had only found out today that they were her children.

!!

No wonder Mommy looked at him strangely this morning. Mommy probably had a lot to say to him, but she didn’t know how to start!

Gu Qi’s eyes grew redder and redder. Mommy had never told him and his sister about the appraisal report. She probably hadn’t thought of what to tell them!

Xiao Shi’s eyes were also red. She looked at Qiao Nian’s back, her eyes sparkling.

At this moment, Qiao Nian had already driven to the funeral home.

After parking the car, Xiao Shi wanted to talk about the appraisal report, but Gu Qi stopped her. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Xiao Shi looked at Gu Qi in confusion.

Gu Qi shook his head, indicating for Xiao Shi not to speak.

Although she didn’t understand what Gu Qi was thinking, she still nodded obediently and didn’t speak.

Gu Qi and Xiao Shi got out of the car. Seeing them climb out, Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on the A4 paper in the middle. Her expression changed slightly. She hurriedly picked up the paper and placed it in her bag, feeling very flustered.

The two children probably didn’t see it!

If they saw it, they wouldn’t be so calm. They would definitely ask her why she didn’t acknowledge them.

Moreover, the two children were so young. They shouldn’t be able to understand the appraisal report.

Qiao Nian comforted herself.

“Mommy!”

Hearing Gu Qi’s voice, Qiao Nian turned around and saw Gu Qi holding Xiao Shi’s hand obediently. He was extremely adorable.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but smile, her eyes narrowing in joy.

Although she didn’t know what had happened to her children when she gave birth, she was very touched that God had sent them back to her side.

Fortunately, her children were still alive.

Qiao Nian’s eyes were slightly red. She closed the car door and walked towards the two children.

When she walked up to the two children, they naturally let go and stood on either side of her, obediently holding her hand.

At this moment, Qiao Nian felt the strong love from the two children. Her heart warmed, and she was so touched that she couldn’t speak.

After a long while, when Qiao Nian calmed down, she looked at Xiao Shi, who was standing beside her, and asked gently, “Xiao Shi, are you ready?”

When Xiao Shi heard Qiao Nian’s words, she nodded seriously.

Before she saw the report, her heart was still in a mess. However, when she thought about how Mommy Nian Nian was her biological mother, she felt a sense of security.

She knew that no matter what happened, her mommy would always be by her side. No matter what she did, her mommy would always support and encourage her.

Holding the hands of the two children, Qiao Nian walked into the funeral parlor.

There were many people in the funeral parlor. Everyone came and went. Many people lowered their heads and wiped their tears. Some people looked sad.

Qiao Nian brought the two children to question the staff and found out that Song Man’s corpse had been sent to the cemetery after it was cremated.

Xiao Shi’s beautiful eyes flickered as she tilted her head in confusion.

Qiao Nian thanked the staff, then returned to the car with the two children.

The cemetery wasn’t far from the funeral home. Qiao Nian arrived in twenty minutes.

When they arrived at the cemetery, Qiao Nian asked around for the location of Song Man’s grave and walked towards it with Xiao Shi and Gu Qi.

Xiao Shi pursed her lips tightly. At the thought that she would see Song Man soon, her expression turned serious. She seemed to have thought of something and looked up at Qiao Nian, asking, “Will she continue to be here in the future?”

Qiao Nian gripped Xiao Shi’s hand tightly and nodded. “She’ll always be here in the future.”

A trace of sorrow flashed in Xiao Shi’s eyes.

Qiao Nian brought Xiao Shi to Song Man’s tombstone. There was a photo of Song Man on the tombstone, and her name was written below.
