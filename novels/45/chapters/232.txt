Chapter 233: Questioning

“I know. She’s a new classmate. She was the last to leave!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

With that, everyone turned to look at Qiao Nian.

Some people’s eyes flickered with surprise, while others were filled with disdain, as if they were already certain that Qiao Nian was a thief.

Qiao Nian sat at the table calmly. She gently placed her violin on the desk, then flipped open the score, preparing to practise it.

Ye Ran glared at Qiao Nian with hatred written all over her face. Furious, she walked up to Qiao Nian and said angrily, “Why did you stay until late yesterday?”

Qiao Nian paused slightly as she flipped open the book of music scores. Hearing Ye Ran’s questioning voice, a trace of impatience flashed in her eyes.

Wang Xuan, who was sitting beside Qiao Nian, could already sense Qiao Nian’s dissatisfaction. Moreover, she felt that her classmates were simply being unreasonable just now!

Ye Ran slammed the table hard and questioned angrily, “Are you deaf? Can’t you hear what I’m saying?”

Wang Xuan sensed the coldness in Qiao Nian’s voice. She had never liked Ye Ran’s pretentious act of using her status to bully others. She stood up and sneered. “Ye Ran, you’re wrong. Who said that she can’t be the last to leave the classroom?”

When Ye Ran heard Wang Xuan’s words, she turned to look at her. A trace of anger flashed in her eyes as she questioned, “She just arrived at school and was the last to leave the classroom. Anyone who sees her will find her suspicious!”

Wang Xuan’s lips curved up slightly. She said coldly, “Ye Ran, why don’t you just ask her directly if she stole your tickets? You’re beating around the bush and putting on an act. Let me tell you, I don’t think Nian Nian will steal the tickets!”

When Ye Ran heard Wang Xuan’s powerful words, her face turned pale. She cursed angrily, “Wang Xuan, are you crazy? Why are you everywhere? Are you deliberately making things difficult for me?”

Wang Xuan crossed her arms and nodded in agreement. “Yes, you finally understand my intentions. I’m determined to make things difficult for you!”

Ye Ran clenched her fists in anger, her body trembling non-stop. “You… you…”

Wang Xuan raised her eyebrows and looked at Ye Ran coldly.

Previously, Ye Ran had stolen her report card just because she couldn’t find it. In the end, she was scolded by the teacher!

Wang Xuan had yet to settle scores with Ye Ran. Now, she finally had a chance. How could she let Ye Ran off? “You what? You stutter!”

“You!” Ye Ran’s face turned red with anger. She raised her hand high and slapped Wang Xuan’s face without hesitation.

Everyone looked at Ye Ran in surprise.

Before Ye Ran’s hand could touch Wang Xuan’s face, Qiao Nian held her back.

Qiao Nian didn’t let go of Ye Ran immediately. Instead, she grabbed Ye Ran’s wrist, her expression calm. Her grip on Ye Ran tightened slightly.

Ye Ran frowned in pain and exclaimed, “Qiao Nian, let go of me! Otherwise, don’t blame me for being impolite!”

However, Qiao Nian didn’t seem to hear Ye Ran’s threat. She was half a head taller than Ye Ran and looked down at her with even greater intensity.

“Ah, ah, it hurts. Let go of me!”

Ye Ran had grown up with a silver spoon in her mouth. She had never suffered such grievances. Now, she was in so much pain that her eyes were red. Tears welled up in her eyes.

Qiao Nian casually shook Ye Ran off.

Ye Ran staggered two steps back before she regained her balance. Only then did she touch her wrist, which Qiao Nian had grabbed. She rubbed it gently and looked at Qiao Nian angrily. “Qiao Nian, you country bumpkin. It’s none of your business if I teach someone with a foul mouth a lesson!”

Wang Xuan crossed her arms. Looking at Ye Ran’s exasperated expression, she sneered. “Ye Ran, wasn’t I telling the truth just now? Aren’t you looking for Nian Nian because you suspect that she stole your tickets?”
