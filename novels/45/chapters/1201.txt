1202 Vicious

Jiang Yue pursed her lips slightly. A trace of pain flashed across her face as she said, “Godfather, do you still remember the first time we met?”

Thank you readers!

“Yes.” Boss Jin nodded.

“When we first got together, you also asked me why my face was disfigured. However, at that time, you weren’t familiar with me, and I was a timid person. Moreover, I didn’t dare to anger Qiao Nian anymore. I was afraid that she would kill me, so I didn’t say anything.”

At this point, Jiang Yue paused for a moment and continued, “She splashed sulfuric acid on my face, so my face was disfigured.”

Although Lu Rao was the one who had splashed sulfuric acid on her face, Lu Rui only splashed sulfuric acid on her face for Qiao Nian’s sake. This assault could only be blamed on Qiao Nian.

If it weren’t for Qiao Nian, how could she have been disfigured?

She was still the young lady of the Gu family and the granddaughter doted on by Grandma!

But now, she had no choice but to stay by Boss Jin’s side as a canary.

Boss Jin’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face not far away, his eyes filled with coldness. He had never expected that gentle-looking girl to be so vicious.

His Yue’er was an innocent and kind girl. Perhaps it was because Yu’er was too innocent and kind that Qiao Nian had disfigured her.

Boss Jin tried hard to suppress the anger in his heart. He moved closer to Jiang Yue’s ear and said softly, “Be good. Yue’er, don’t worry. I’ll definitely make those who bullied you suffer the consequences.”

“Godfather, you’re so good to me. Let’s forget it. Gu Zhou is still standing beside Qiao Nian.” Jiang Yue looked at Boss Jin worriedly and said sweetly, “I only want to be with Godfather. I just hope that she won’t attack me again.”

When Boss Jin heard Jiang Yue’s words, his heart warmed.

He had once owned many women, but those women had all taken a liking to his money and power. However, there was not a single innocent and harmless girl like Jiang Yue.

Boss Jin also knew very well that beauty was very important to girls. Not only would his Yue’er not pursue Qiao Nian for revenge, but she also hoped that Qiao Nian would let her off.

His Yue’er only hoped to be with him for the rest of her life. It was his fortune to meet her.

“We’ll discuss this at length. You don’t have to worry about me!” Boss Jin looked at Qiao Nian not far away with a complicated expression. If only Qiao Nian hadn’t married Gu Zhou. Now, being enemies with Qiao Nian was equivalent to being enemies with the entire Gu family.

Jiang Yue looked worried, but she was overjoyed

She had been by Boss Jin’s side during this period of time and had seen his ruthless methods. If Boss Jin helped her take revenge, Qiao Nian would not be far from her death.

Gu Zhou.

Could it be that his heart was made of stone? Why couldn’t it be warm?

However, Jiang Yue quickly mocked herself. If Gu Zhou’s heart was really made of stone, why would he fall in love with Qiao Nian?

Jiang Yue was letting her imagination run wild when she sensed that Boss Jin’s grip on her waist had tightened. A gentle smile appeared on her face as she looked at Boss Jin.

Boss Jin said in a low voice, “Mr. Chen is here. Let’s go take a look too.”

Jiang Yue smiled. It was like a Queen of the Night in the night, so beautiful that it was suffocating.

“Mr. Chen!”

“Oh my god, I didn’t expect Mr. Chen to be here too!”

“Mr. Chen, long time no see. How have you been?”

“Mr. Chen looks stronger than before!”

Many people present were friends with Mr. Chen. One by one, they came up to greet him, but their words revealed respect.

Qiao Nian looked over and saw Mr. Chen walking in. A group of people surrounded him and tried to get to know him.

Mr. Chen was very tall, about 1.85 meters. He was wearing a dark green shirt and a black windbreaker today, making him look much younger.

He didn’t look handsome, but the more she looked at him, the more he looked good. He exuded a noble aura.
