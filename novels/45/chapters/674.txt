Qiao Nian nodded in embarrassment and said, “Yes, I think if I said that it was a melody that suddenly appeared in my mind, no one would believe me!”

Lu Nian instantly understood. If Qiao Nian had said that just now, he definitely wouldn’t have believed her.

He had never believed that there was telepathy in this world. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

If this person was Sugar, he would have no problem.

“Sugar, you…”

Just as Lu Nian was about to speak, a ringtone interrupted him.

“I’m sorry, my phone is ringing.” Qiao Nian smiled and hurriedly took out her phone from her bag. When she saw the caller ID, she was slightly stunned.

It was Gu Zhou.

Why would Gu Zhou call her?

When Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on the time on her phone, she realized that it was already one in the morning.

Oh my god, time passed so quickly.

At this moment, Lu Nian, who was sitting beside Qiao Nian, also noticed the caller ID.

At this moment, Lu Nian suddenly realized something. Although he had found his sister, she was already married.

His small, cute, and clingy sister had actually become someone else’s wife.

This difference made Lu Nian feel a little uncomfortable.

He also wanted to bring his sister to his side and dote on her. He wanted to take good care of her and make up for what he owed his sister.

But his sister was married.

His sister had to go home every night.

But the home his sister had to return to was not his home.

Lu Nian lowered his gaze in pain. Why didn’t he find his sister earlier? That way, he could have spent more time with her.

Lu Nian hated himself. He shouldn’t have believed that his sister was dead. Instead, he should have searched for her all over the world.

If he had worked harder to find his sister earlier, his sister would have been able to enjoy life earlier and not suffer in the Qiao family.

Qiao Nian didn’t know what Lu Nian was thinking. Her gaze fell on the phone screen and she frowned slightly, her eyes filled with confusion.

In the past, no matter how late she got home, Gu Zhou would not ask.

Could something have happened to Gu Qi?

Qiao Nian frowned slightly. She hurriedly picked up the call and placed the phone to her ear. “Gu Zhou, did something happen at home?”

Lu Nian was feeling terrible. When he heard Qiao Nian say the word “home”, his eyes couldn’t help but turn red.

His sister couldn’t go home with him now, because she was already married to Gu Zhou.

His sister had already called the Gu family’s villa home.

As a brother, he was too useless. Not only had he not caught the mastermind, but his sister could not go home openly. He also wanted to hear his sister say to him, “Second Brother, let’s go home together!”

“Where are you?”

Gu Zhou’s hoarse voice came through the phone. There seemed to be a hint of concern in his words.

Hearing Gu Zhou’s voice, Qiao Nian frowned slightly and asked, “Do you have a cold? Did you take any medicine?”

“It’s one o’clock. It’s getting late!”

This time, Qiao Nian could hear the displeasure in Gu Zhou’s tone.

Could it be that Gu Zhou was angry?

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. This was the first time she had encountered such a situation.

“Huh?”

Gu Zhou’s cold voice came through the phone again. He seemed to be waiting for his answer.

Qiao Nian coughed, looking awkward. “Actually, I…”

“Is it inconvenient?”

On the surface, Gu Zhou’s voice sounded like he was concerned about her, but if one listened carefully, they could hear the coldness in his words.

It was as if he was threatening Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian felt a chill run down her spine. Thinking that it was indeed getting late, she should go back and rest, she said, “I’ll get a taxi back now. I…”

Before Qiao Nian could finish speaking, Gu Zhou interrupted her mercilessly. “I’m downstairs now. Come down.”

Gu Zhou’s voice was unquestionably strong.

Qiao Nian gripped her phone tightly and glanced at Lu Nian and Lu Zhu. She agreed and hung up.
