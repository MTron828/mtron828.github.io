Chapter 121 Lunatic

Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

Deep down, Director Lin trusted Qiao Nian. However, he was the organizer in this situation, and he had to give everyone an explanation. He asked, “Miss Qiao Xin, Nian Nian, please tell me the truth. Who exactly does

this pot of Suranne Grass belong to?”

When Qiao Xin heard Director Lin’s words, she turned to glance at him, looking as if she wanted to speak, but was holding herself back. Her gaze finally fell on Qiao Nian’s face, and a trace of hesitation flashed across

her face. For a moment, she looked like she was caught in a serious dilemma.

After a while, Qiao Xin’s gaze hardened as she said, “The Suranne Grass belongs to Sister!”

Qiao Nian didn’t speak. There was nothing wrong with Qiao Xin’s answer, save for her acting as if she were giving in.

Everyone couldn’t help but feel indignant for Qiao Xin.

“Qiao Nian, you’ve gone too far. How can you bully your sister like this?”

“Qiao Nian, you’re really shameless. You’re going crazy trying to attract attention!”

“Miss Qiao Xin, you can’t keep backing down. This will only make some brazen people, whom I won’t name, demand for more and more!”

Gu Zhou stood at the side, his thin lips pursed and his phoenix-like eyes narrowed. His gaze fell on the people who had spoken up for Qiao Xin.

The coldness in his eyes gradually intensified. His well-defined hands clenched tightly into fists, and the veins on the back of his hands bulged viciously, as if he was holding back something.

Seeing this, Chen Qing hurriedly jotted down all their names. Those people clearly didn’t know what was good for them. Second Young Master Gu would definitely require those names.

Tears welled up in Qiao Xin’s eyes. She turned to look at Qiao Nian, who was standing next to her, and put on a pitiful expression. “Everyone, stop talking. This was cultivated by my sister. Please stop attacking her.

Thank you.”

Not only did Qiao Xin’s words fail to make the people around her sympathize with Qiao Nian, but it also increased their dissatisfaction with Qiao Nian several times over.

Some of them were so angry that they yearned to step forward and tear Qiao Nian to shreds. This was the first time they had seen such a brazen woman.

At this moment, a middle-aged man walked in. He was wearing a suit and leather shoes, and had his hair combed back. He walked up to Qiao Xin and said gently, “Second Young Mistress, I’m really sorry for being late!”

Everyone’s gaze fell on the middle-aged man.

The man was none other than the big shot of the scientific research field, Song Hua.

The famous Song Hua had developed medicine to treat leukemia when he was 25, saving countless families.

Song Hua was very well-known in the medical field and was deeply respected.

After that, Song Hua had made many contributions to the country. This time, he came specially to look for Qiao Xin.

Everyone’s gaze fell on Qiao Xin again.

Initially, they didn’t know where Qiao Xin had gotten the Suranne Grass from, but now they understood. So there was someone above Qiao Xin.

Song Hua’s gaze swept across the crowd. He said solemnly, “Ladies and gentlemen, Qiao Xin was the one who planted the Suranne Grass. I was once fortunate enough to witness its growth.”

Song Hua’s words seemed to reassure everyone. Now, everyone was completely certain that Qiao Xin was the one who had planted the Suranne Grass.

Qiao Nian frowned slightly. She hadn’t expected Song Hua to appear, much less that he was here to help Qiao Xin.

She finally understood why Qiao Xin was so bold as to say that the Suranne Grass belonged to her. So there was a big shot backing her up.

So Qiao Xin had put in a lot of effort in preparation for this battle.

Qiao Nian asked calmly, “Mr. Song, do you know how Suranne Grass is planted?” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

With his hands behind his back, Song Hua said with an air of frankness, “Naturally, one has to first plant the seed. The plant will take root, germinate, and finally sprout.”

“Heh.” Qiao Nian was now completely certain that Song Hua didn’t know anything. He was simply describing the process of how the Suranne Grass grew according to his imagination. “Is that so?”

When the people around them heard Qiao Nian’s words, they were all displeased. They felt that Qiao Nian was too arrogant. She didn’t even respect her elders..
