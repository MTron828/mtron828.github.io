Chapter 685: Candy

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Zhou Zhou was like a beautiful and charming poppy, constantly challenging her rationality.

At this moment, Zhou Zhou was taking a bath. His voice was a little soft, like a kitten, making one unable to look away.

When Qiao Nian heard Zhou Zhou’s words, her expression faltered slightly. She looked at him in confusion and asked, “What’s wrong?”

When Zhou Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he stared unblinkingly at her and asked carefully, “Were you giving me candy just now?”

Candy?

When did she give him candy?

Qiao Nian stopped what she was doing and pursed her lips slightly. There seemed to be a hint of sweetness on her lips.

No wonder Zhou Zhou thought it was candy.

Qiao Nian didn’t want to lead the innocent Zhou Zhou astray, so she nodded casually and said, “Yes.”

“Sweet!”

“Alright, I’ll bathe you!” As Qiao Nian spoke, she raised the water in the bathtub to help Zhou Zhou wash his back. She lowered her gaze slightly, unwilling to bring up the topic from before.

However, Zhou Zhou seemed to be still reminiscing about the sweetness just now. He turned to look at Qiao Nian and said seriously, “I still want to eat it.”

Qiao Nian paused, a trace of embarrassment flashing in her eyes.

“Nian Nian, Zhou Zhou still wants to eat candy!” As Zhou Zhou spoke, he turned around. His clear eyes were fixed on Qiao Nian’s lips, and his gaze gradually darkened.

Qiao Nian closed her eyes and tried her best to take a deep breath.

Indeed, a lie had to be filled with countless lies.

Although she knew that she was the one who had brought Zhou Zhou into the pit, she would never admit her mistake. She tried hard to regain her composure and said, “Turn around and take a shower!”

“Nian Nian!”

Zhou Zhou looked at Qiao Nian longingly.

He had always wanted to eat candy. He had heard that candy was the most delicious thing in the world.

That time, Ah Nian came to play with him and even brought a lollipop.

His mother had never let him eat candy, but when he heard from Ah Nian that lollipops were delicious, he couldn’t help but look at them. He wanted to eat them too.

Ah Nian had given him the lollipop.

He took the lollipop from Ah Nian and was about to put it in his mouth to try it when his mother ran over crazily and threw the lollipop away!

His mother kicked him three meters away and said fiercely, “You did it on purpose. You wanted to kill your brother!”

Zhou Zhou would always remember the lollipop that had fallen at his feet. It was pink, just like Nian Nian’s lips.

At that time, he had wanted to pick up the lollipop and eat it. He didn’t mind it being dirty. He just wanted to know what candy tasted like.

However, his mother rushed over and slapped him.

That day, he was locked in a small black room for a day and a night. There was no water or food, and he fainted.

When he regained consciousness, he saw Ah Nian crying as he moved closer to him.

From then on, he never ate candy again.

She didn’t want to kill his brother or make Ah Nian worry.

But now, his brother seemed to have recovered.

Unknowingly, Zhou Zhou’s eyes were filled with tears. He looked at Qiao Nian aggrievedly and asked, “Nian Nian, can I eat candy?” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Qiao Nian was about to explode when she inadvertently met Zhou Zhou’s gaze.

Desire.

There was also a trace of humility.

How had this happened?

How could such an arrogant person have such a humble expression?

At this moment, Qiao Nian realized that Zhou Zhou didn’t want to kiss her. He just wanted to eat candy.

Had he never eaten candy before?

Qiao Nian’s heart ached for him. She didn’t know what had happened to him in the past, nor did she know why he had become like this. She smiled and said, “Then wait for me. I’ll get you some candy!”

With that, Qiao Nian was about to stand up and leave when Gu Zhou suddenly grabbed her hand.

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. Before she could react, she was pulled into the water by the man.

Water splashed everywhere.

The water in the bathtub overflowed.

“Zhou Zhou, you…”

Before Qiao Nian could finish speaking, the man covered her lips with his.

Before Qiao Nian could react, he had already reached for her lips.

Gradually, her oxygen was taken away. Qiao Nian’s mind grew more and more confused. Gradually, she felt suffocated, and her body grew weaker and weaker. Instinctively, she wrapped her arms around Gu Zhou’s neck.
