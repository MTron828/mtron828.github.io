Chapter 13: The Jade Pendant Appears!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Xin heard the voice coming from above her, and looked up. What remained of her light brown hair fell on her shoulders in charming waves. She stared blankly at the man standing in front of her.

Gu Zhou stared unblinkingly at the jade pendant in front of Qiao Xin. His expression was complicated and his voice was frighteningly cold. “Who gave you the jade pendant?”

Qiao Xin was stunned. She followed Gu Zhou’s line of sight. Could the jade pendant be his?

Was the man who had been with Qiao Nian years ago Gu Zhou?

What a stroke of luck!

If she were to marry Gu Zhou, she would enjoy a life of luxury.

She felt that Gu Zhou would definitely look down on Qiao Nian!

Qiao Xin looked up at the man in front of her. He was as handsome as an otherworldly spirit. Her lips curved up slightly. She had to make this man become hers.

Gradually, Gu Zhou began to lose his patience. His eyes seemed to be filled with ice. He looked at Qiao Xin with a dark expression. “Who gave you the jade pendant?”

Qiao Xin picked up the jade pendant. Supporting herself on the sofa, she stood up awkwardly, a bright smile appearing on her face. She cradled the jade pendant in her hand and held it out to Gu Zhou, saying, “This was given to me by a very important person!”

Gu Zhou looked at the jade pendant in her hand. His eyes were filled with rage. This jade pendant had belonged to him. It was the token he had given to that woman!

But that girl had never looked for him, and all videos from that night had been deleted.

However, he later got someone to investigate and only found out that the girl had died in childbirth.

Gu Zhou stared hard at Qiao Xin. He demanded, “Who is that person?”

Qiao Xin’s hand retreated slightly. She really didn’t expect Gu Zhou to realize that this jade pendant wasn’t hers. She thought for a while and then said, “That person instructed me to personally hand this to that man!”

Gu Zhou looked significantly at Qiao Xin. No one’s thoughts could escape his eyes. He could tell that Qiao Xin was deliberately hiding something. Could it be that the petite cat-like girl was still alive?

She had to be!

“Brother-in-law, do you know who this jade pendant belongs to?” Qiao Xin carefully probed.

“It belongs to my friend.” Seeing Qiao Xin’s disappointed face, Gu Zhou walked out. Before he found that woman, he would never let anyone know about what happened five years ago, lest someone with ill intentions made use of that information.

With those parting words, Gu Zhou made to leave without hesitation. When he thought about how Qiao Xin had swallowed the jade pendant, he felt a wave of disgust. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Seeing Gu Zhou turn around and leave, Qiao Xin quickly asked with an innocent air, “Brother-in-law, can you take me to see your friend?”

Gu Zhou’s footsteps didn’t stop at all. He didn’t even glance at Qiao Xin and continued heading towards the doorway.

The oppressive aura in the room did not dissipate for a long time.

Gu Zhou walked outside. From afar, he saw Qiao Nian standing in front of the rockery.

She had a petite figure, and was wearing a white knee-length skirt. When the wind blew, the scattered sunlight reflected off her long hair and skirt, creating a beautiful picture.

“Let’s go!” Gu Zhou walked up to Qiao Nian and said in a low voice.

Qiao Nian took a deep breath and turned to look at Gu Zhou. There was a hint of a smile in her eyes, as if she had not engaged in physical violence mere moments ago. “Okay!”

On the way back, Gu Zhou stole a glance at Qiao Nian. Thinking of Qiao Nian’s huge reaction upon seeing the jade pendant, he had a vague notion that Qiao Nian might be acquainted with the girl from five years ago.

When they arrived at the Gu residence, Gu Zhou remained in the car, unmoving. He said to Qiao Nian, “Head back first. I have other errands to run.”

“Okay.” Qiao Nian didn’t say anything else, and got out of the carriage swiftly.

After Qiao Nian left, Chen Qing, who had been driving, said excitedly, “Second Master, we’ve finally found…”

“It’s not her,” Gu Zhou said with certainty. His voice was still as cold as ever.

“Didn’t she have the token?” Chen Qing asked, somewhat unsure. Even though he felt that this woman was a little pretentious, she was still…

Gu Zhou adjusted his sleeves and glanced at Lin Nan, who was in the passenger seat. He ordered, “Investigate everyone in the Qiao family, especially those who are close to Qiao Nian and Qiao Xin.”

“Yes, sir,” Lin Nan answered and began to contact the hacker.

At the Gu residence.

Qiao Nian sat lazily on the swing in the garden. She was still a little unsure of Gu Zhou’s attitude. Gu Zhou seemed to react oddly when he saw the jade pendant. Moreover, she had eavesdropped on the conversation between Gu Zhou and Qiao Xin at the living room entrance.

Who exactly did that jade pendant belong to?

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze. She wanted to see what Qiao Xin was going to do next.

The next day.

Qiao Nian woke up. Standing in the bedroom, she could see Butler Zhao leading Qiao Xin towards the castle.

She froze for a moment, then frowned slightly. Why was Qiao Xin here? Did Gu Zhou ask for her to be brought here?
