Qiao Nian had never expected Lu Qi to be a foodie.

Song Yu looked at Lu Qi worriedly and said, “Will your stomach feel uncomfortable if you suddenly eat so much? Why don’t you eat some digestive pills?”

Matriarch Lu looked at Lu Qi and frowned. “Call a private doctor over.”

“There’s no need. I’m fine. I’ll be fine after digesting it,” Lu Qi said with certainty.

!!

Actually, she usually didn’t eat much. This time, she couldn’t help but eat so much because of Second Brother’s cooking.

“Let me take a look at her.” Qiao Nian stood up and walked up to Lu Qi, taking her pulse. Then, she said, “It’s fine. Just eat less for the next two days.”

Lu Qi said proudly, “Look, I’m right. I’m fine.”

Qiao Nian walked over to Gu Zhou and sat down. Just as she was about to speak to him, her phone rang.

She took out her phone and looked at the caller ID on it. She frowned imperceptibly.

She glanced at the living room. Everyone was chatting happily, so she didn’t want to disturb such a beautiful atmosphere. She took her phone and walked out.

Qiao Yu?

Her relationship with the Qiao family was already like fire and water. Why did he still call her?

Qiao Nian walked out and looked at her cell phone. Her eyes turned cold as she picked up the call. “What can I do for you?”

Qiao Yu’s voice came from the other side of the cell phone.

“Nian’er, are you free tomorrow?”

“If you have anything to say, just say it. I’m very busy.”

“It’s Grandma’s death anniversary. I wanted to ask if you had time to come back and visit her.”

Qiao Yu’s voice was very gentle, and there was a hint of caution in it, as if he was trying to please Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian didn’t notice Qiao Yu’s tone at all. The light in her eyes gradually disappeared.

She had been so busy recently that she had almost forgotten that tomorrow was Grandma’s death anniversary.

Matriarch Qiao’s loving face gradually appeared in Qiao Nian’s mind. She still remembered every time Grandma looked at her, her gaze was filled with love and doting.

In the Qiao family, Grandma was the only one who treated her well.

No matter how bad the Qiao family was, these things had nothing to do with Grandma.

Qiao Nian took a deep breath and said, “I’ll visit Grandma’s grave.”

Qiao Yu heaved a sigh of relief when he got the answer he wanted. “In that case, we’ll wait for you at home. Shall we go to the cemetery together?”

“Please mind your words.” Qiao Nian frowned. She turned back to look at the situation in the room. The family was harmonious, and she said again, “The Qiao family isn’t my family. I’ll go straight to Grandma’s grave tomorrow.”

In the room, her brothers were still discussing her childhood. Although Lu Qi couldn’t sit still, she leaned on her walking stick and laughed hysterically.

It was as warm as spring inside, and the weather outside was as cold as ice.

Gu Zhou was standing at the side, looking at her.

Qiao Nian’s lips curved up slightly, her eyes filled with smiles.

There was a moment of silence on the other end of the cell phone. After a long while, Qiao Yu’s dejected voice came through. “I understand.”

Hearing Qiao Yu’s low and disappointed voice, Qiao Nian felt a little depressed.

Although she hated the Qiao family, she had mixed feelings about Qiao Yu.

After Grandma passed away, Qiao Yu had been by her side, letting her feel the warmth of home.

However, she and Qiao Yu were not the same kind of people.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian hung up.

Instead of dwelling on what Qiao Yu was thinking, it was better to cut ties with him as soon as possible.

Gu Zhou walked out. He was a little worried about Qiao Nian because she still hadn’t entered after hanging up. He asked with concern, “What happened? Are you unhappy?” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou. Recalling Matriarch Qiao’s doting gaze, she said in a low voice, “Grandma Qiao’s death anniversary is tomorrow. I want to visit her grave.”

After a pause, Qiao Nian continued, “In the past, when I was in the Qiao family, Grandma treated me better than she treated Qiao Yu and Qiao Xin.”

Puzzled, Gu Zhou asked, “Didn’t you grow up in the countryside when you were young? She treated you so well. Why would she agree to send you to the countryside?”

“At that time, Grandma…” Qiao Nian recalled the situation back then and her voice choked. “Grandma was sent to the intensive care unit.”
