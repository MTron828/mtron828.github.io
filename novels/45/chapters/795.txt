796 Cute and Sweet

Gu Qi stood there expressionlessly.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Qi, her lips curving up slightly.

Lin Tao had dressed Gu Qi up like a little princess. He was wearing a long black wig and a white princess dress. His face was chubby, and he was wearing white lace stockings and a pair of red leather shoes. He looked exceptionally obedient and adorable.

Gu Qi’s eyes were sparkling like black grapes. He was extremely adorable.

However, his expression was dark. He was very dissatisfied with his current outfit.

In the past, he had thought that his father liked girls so he would wear female clothes. But now that he knew that his father liked him, he was no longer willing to be a girl.

Why did he have to wear such strange clothes?

At this moment, Qiao Nian looked at Gu Qi’s cute and sweet appearance. The scene of her first meeting with Gu Qi appeared in her mind.

At that time, she had thought that Gu Qi was a cool little girl.

At that time, she had a good impression of Gu Qi.

She was really willing to be her mother and hear Gu Qi call her Mommy.

Perhaps after Song Man arrived, she might never have the chance to let Gu Qi call her Mommy again.

Qiao Nian recalled what Matriarch Gu had told her previously. Matriarch Gu had said that Gu Qi was very willing to let her be his mommy.

Qiao Nian knew in her heart that at that time, Gu Qi had yet to hear from his biological mother. His thoughts would probably change after Song Man arrived.

She recalled that when Gu Qi was sick, he was lying on the bed and calling for Mommy. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Seeing that Qiao Nian was silent, Lin Tao thought that she was enthralled. She said proudly, “Aren’t I amazing? I made Xiao Qi look so good. Isn’t he especially adorable?”

Initially, Gu Qi was very dissatisfied with Lin Tao asking him to wear female clothes. However, when he heard Lin Tao ask Qiao Nian this, his expression improved a lot. He looked at Qiao Nian expectantly, as if waiting for her answer.

At this moment, Qiao Nian didn’t notice the anticipation in Gu Qi’s eyes. She smiled and pinched Gu Qi’s little face. It felt really good. She said dotingly, “Cute. Our Xiao Qi is the cutest!”

After Gu Qi changed into female clothes, he finally smiled for the first time. That smile was like the warm winter sun.

Lin Tao noticed the smile on Gu Qi’s face and a trace of surprise flashed in her eyes.

She had always thought that Gu Qi was a cold young master who didn’t know how to smile.

Now, it seemed that Gu Qi was just unwilling to smile at her.

It seemed that Gu Qi really liked Qiao Nian. That was why he was smiling so brightly at her.

Lin Tao heaved a sigh of relief and said, “Xiao Qi, I took care of you for the entire day yesterday and even dressed you up so beautifully. How can you not smile at me? This is too unfair!”

Gu Qi did not even look at Lin Tao.

How could Lin Tao compare to Auntie Nian Nian?

Auntie Nian Nian was the most important to him. No one could compare to Auntie Nian Nian!

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Lin Tao’s face. Smiling, she said, “Stop teasing Gu Qi. How did you two get along yesterday?”

“Of course we got along well. I think I’m talented at taking care of children!” Lin Tao said proudly.

Qiao Nian smiled at Lin Tao, then pushed Xiao Shi in front of her. Smiling, she said, “Since you’re so talented at taking care of children, please help me take care of Xiao Shi!”

Lin Tao’s smile froze. She lowered her face and asked aggrievedly, “How can you bear to let me take care of the two children alone?”

“I believe you have the talent to take care of children! Help me take care of them for another day!” Qiao Nian said seriously.

“Alright then!” Lin Tao agreed reluctantly.

Qiao Nian was her best friend. Of course, she could only agree.

When Gu Qi heard Qiao Nian’s words, he blinked in confusion. He looked at Qiao Nian expectantly and asked, “Auntie Nian Nian, aren’t you going to be with us?”

“I have something on now. I’ll be back soon. Can you help Auntie Lin Tao take good care of your sister at home?”

When Gu Qi heard Qiao Nian’s words, the smile in his eyes gradually disappeared. He nodded and said, “Yes.”
