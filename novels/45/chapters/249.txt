Chapter 250: It Wasn’t Her!

Sweat gradually broke out on Xia Xue’s forehead. She had really used all her strength to play this song, but the effect she produced was worlds apart from the original composition.

Sometimes, the technique was not as important as the feelings conveyed when one played the violin.

“Missing” was a song about how one person missed another. She had already used all her strength to express the meaning of the song.

Just as Xia Xue was about to reach the climax, she stopped, worried that she would make a mistake. She could only hope that Brother Cao did not hear the flaws in her song.

Xia Xue placed the violin on a stool and looked at Brother Cao uneasily.

Brother Cao was still immersed in the music Xia Xue had just played. He lowered his gaze and nodded. “Not bad. You’re not old, but you’re already very good at this.”

Xia Xue’s heart, which had been in her throat, settled back down. She heaved a sigh of relief and said humbly, “Brother Cao, I’m really sorry. My hands are still a little sore. I wasn’t able to perform properly because of the pressure.”

Brother Cao smiled and nodded lightly.

At this moment, Dong Hua’s impatient voice came through Brother Cao’s earpiece.

“Alright, let her go back and wait for the news.”

Brother Cao looked at Xia Xue with a faint smile on his face. “Miss Xia, you can leave first. Just wait for my news.”

Xia Xue felt uneasy. She didn’t know what was going on either. She nodded lightly and bowed to Brother Cao before leaving.

Gao Lin, who had been waiting at the side, saw Xia Xue walking over and hurriedly pulled her out.

The two of them walked out of the training room. Gao Lin lowered her voice and said excitedly, “Sister Xia Xue, your violin skills are really amazing. Brother Cao was so engrossed in it just now. I think Brother Cao is very satisfied with you!”

A humble smile appeared on Xia Xue’s face. She said softly, “I didn’t perform as well as I should have today. I wonder if Brother Cao will be satisfied.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“He must be very satisfied with you. Sister Xia Xue, you don’t have to worry. Mr. Dong Hua’s female musician spot was specially prepared for you!” Gao Lin flattered her.

When Xia Xue heard Gao Lin’s words, she smiled faintly and didn’t speak. Actually, she also felt that Brother Cao was very satisfied with her.

Now, it seemed that she would be able to debut very soon. When the time came, she would definitely be famous throughout the country.

In the training room.

A man in a well-tailored suit walked out of the piano room at the far end. He walked towards Brother Cao.

Brother Cao looked at him and couldn’t help but say, “Miss Xia’s violin skills are not bad. She’s quite thoughtful. Aren’t you worried that your performance will lack a young female musician? Then why did you let her leave?”

“She’s not the person I’m looking for,” Dong Hua said without hesitation, his light brown eyes slightly narrowed. He recalled the sound of Xia Xue playing the violin and couldn’t help but frown.

To be able to produce such a sound at Xia Xue’s age was already not bad.

However, this sound was far inferior to the music he had heard yesterday.

That sound was delicate and sorrowful. It perfectly expresses the meaning of “Missing”. It had the style of a great musician.

Dong Hua sighed slightly. Her eyes were cold as he said with absolute certainty, “It wasn’t her!”

Brother Cao’s gaze fell on Dong Hua’s face. He said, “I think she’s not bad, but time is really tight right now. I can’t find a suitable female musician for the time being. Why don’t we use her first?”

“Brother Cao, do you think she’s qualified to be my female musician?” Dong Hua asked with a frown.

“I think she’s alright!”

“You’ve been by my side for so many years, but you still don’t have good taste.”
