Chapter 1819 - 1819 Earrings

Worried that Qiao Nian would misunderstand Gu Qi, Xiao Shi hurriedly explained, “Mommy, it’s not like that. We like both Daddy and Mommy! Brother even dreamed that Daddy and Mommy would come back together last night!”

Qiao Nian’s heart warmed. She looked at Gu Qi in front of her and said happily, “I’m sorry. Mommy had something very important to do this time and has no choice but to leave you. In the future, Mommy will try her best to stay by your side.”

Gu Qi took the initiative to hug Qiao Nian, his eyes filled with smiles.

Xiao Shi and Xiao Bao also hugged Qiao Nian tightly.

After a while, Qiao Nian let go of the three little ones. Her gaze landed on Xiao Bao’s face and she said gently, “Xiao Bao, can you do Mommy a favor?”

“Of course. Xiao Bao is Mommy’s cutest and most capable child.” Xiao Bao puffed out his chest proudly and said happily.

“It’s like this. When Mommy slipped in just now, she dropped an earring. Can Xiao Bao help Mommy find it?” Qiao Nian asked gently. She even took out the earring on the other ear and showed it to Xiao Bao.

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Xiao Bao immediately nodded and said seriously, “Mommy, don’t worry. I promise to complete the mission.”

“Good child.” Qiao Nian praised Xiao Bao and pointed in a direction.

After Xiao Bao received the mission, he quickly ran over.

Gu Qi looked in the direction Xiao Bao had left. The street lamps there were a little dark, so he couldn’t see what was there at all. His brows furrowed even more tightly as he looked at Qiao Nian worriedly. He said in a low voice, “Mommy, there aren’t many street lamps over there. It looks dark. I’ll accompany Xiao Bao to look for it.”

When Xiao Shi heard his brother’s words, he hurriedly said, “Mommy, I’ll help too!”

Seeing that Gu Qi and Xiao Shi were about to go over, Qiao Nian hurriedly pulled them back with a doting smile. “He’ll definitely be able to do this well.”

Xiao Bao ran over and stared carefully at the ground. Mommy had lost an emerald earring. Where was the earring?

Xiao Bao searched carefully for a long time but could not find anything. Then, he walked further in and looked carefully at the ground. He still could not find the earring.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Strange, where was the earring?

Chang Feng, who had been hiding in the dark, looked at Xiao Bao intently. His eyes were filled with gentleness. Looking at Xiao Bao’s small figure, the corners of his mouth could not help but curl up.

Although Xiao Bao was young, his walking posture was upright and he did not sway. It seemed that even if Xiao Bao was not by their side, he had still exercised on time.

However, Xiao Bao looked really small now. He was wearing cartoon pajamas. When the wind blew on him, it was as if he would be blown away in the next second.

Qiao Nian held Gu Qi and Xiao Shi’s hands and walked behind. They were still a distance away from Xiao Bao.

Qiao Nian’s earring wasn’t very far away. It was just beside the path. If she walked further, she would be able to see it.

She had specially chosen this place to put the earring. Firstly, she was worried that if it was placed too far away, Xiao Bao might fall sleep. Secondly, it could not be too close to Eldest Senior Brother.

She did not understand why Eldest Senior Brother did not want to see Xiao Bao in person and even wanted to see him secretly.

In less than two minutes, Xiao Bao found Qiao Nian’s earring. The emerald earring emitted a dazzling light under the light.

“Mommy, I found it!” Xiao Bao raised the earring in his hand and said happily to Qiao Nian, who was walking over, “Xiao Bao is very awesome!”

Qiao Nian let go of Gu Qi and Xiao Shi and gently touched Xiao Bao’s forehead. She smiled and said, “Xiao Bao is really impressive. He actually found Mommy’s earring!”

Qiao Nian picked Xiao Bao up and looked past him at the forest not far away.

Eldest Senior Brother should be able to see Xiao Bao clearly from this position!

A gust of wind blew past. Seeing that Xiao Bao was dressed so thinly, Qiao Nian said in a low voice, “It’s windy and cold outside. Let’s go home first!”

Qiao Nian turned around with Xiao Bao in her arms. The smile on Xiao Bao’s face gradually froze, and his pupils dilated before disappearing.

“Mommy, put me down!” Xiao Bao said solemnly.

Qiao Nian did not understand and placed Xiao Bao on the ground. Before she could ask, she saw Xiao Bao running towards the forest. That direction happened to be where Eldest Senior Brother was hiding.
