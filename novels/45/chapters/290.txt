Chapter 291: Dirty Guess

Chen Qing was slightly stunned.

What was going on?

That was not what Second Young Master had said just now.

However, Qiao Nian didn’t think too much about it. She put the violin away and closed the car door.

At this moment, Gao Lin, Xia Xue, and Liu Yu came out of the campus and saw Qiao Nian getting into a Bentley.

A calculative look flashed in Xia Xue’s eyes. She pretended to be puzzled and asked in confusion, “Lin Lin, didn’t you say that she came from the countryside? I don’t think so. Otherwise, why would a luxury car pick her up?”

Of course, Liu Yu had also seen Qiao Nian get into the Bentley. Her gaze fell on the license plate. She vaguely felt that it was a little familiar, but she couldn’t remember.

Gao Lin was already jealous of Qiao Nian. She had initially thought that Xia Xue would steal Qiao Nian’s position and make sure that Qiao Nian would never be able to make a comeback.

However, Qiao Nian’s musical skills were still very good. Most of her classmates would probably become Qiao Nian’s fans tomorrow.

At the thought of this, Gao Lin’s frown deepened. She said angrily, “Those who can enter this school halfway are either rich or noble. This means that Qiao Nian is quite capable.”

Hearing Gao Lin’s words, Liu Yu instantly understood. Her eyes were filled with disdain. “There aren’t many people in An City who can afford to drive a limited edition Bentley. Aren’t they all old men in their forties or fifties?”

When Gao Lin heard Liu Yu’s words, she nodded in agreement.

Xia Xue pursed her lips and asked in confusion, “Do you think that person is from the music industry?”

“How is that possible?” Just as Gao Lin finished speaking, she thought of something and said coldly, “She plays the violin so intensely. It must be because the person who keeps her especially likes the violin, so she practices every day to please him.”

The more Gao Lin spoke, the more she felt that her guess was correct. She nodded fiercely. “Yes, that must be it.”

Xia Xue frowned in disapproval. “Is that really the case?”

This time, Liu Yu stood on Gao Lin’s side and said angrily, “Otherwise, why would she be carrying a violin?”

The more Gao Lin thought about it, the angrier she became. She took a step forward and clenched her fists tightly. She said indignantly, “She must be a kept woman. We have to expose her. We can’t let such a despicable person stay in our school, lest it affects our school’s reputation!”

Gao Lin took out her phone and hurriedly took a photo of the Bentley.

Liu Yu looked at the Bentley getting further and further away and asked worriedly, “Did you get it?”

“Of course. I’ve filmed everything. This time, I must ruin her reputation!” Hatred flashed in Gao Lin’s eyes.

Xia Xue, who was standing at the side, remained silent. She lowered her gaze slightly, her red lips curving up.

In the car.

Fu Hang looked down at his phone and asked casually, “How was school today?”

Qiao Nian thought about what had happened in the music training room. She couldn’t help but smile. “It was fine.”

“Have you seen Lu Nian?”

“Yes.” Qiao Nian nodded.

After that, the car fell silent.

Qiao Nian turned to look at Gu Zhou, who happened to look over. For a moment, her expression paled.

He exuded a cold aura, like an ice cube that no one could melt.

Qiao Nian’s gaze accidentally fell on Gu Zhou’s thin and sexy lips. She suddenly recalled Gu Zhou’s second personality.

Zhou Zhou… Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Gu Zhou raised his eyebrows slightly. “Is there something dirty on my face?”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. Only then did she realize that she had been staring at Gu Zhou. “No, how have you been feeling recently?”

Gu Zhou pondered for a moment, his voice low and hoarse. “In what way exactly?”

Qiao Nian was stunned by Gu Zhou’s words. She blinked in confusion and asked, “Your health, of course. Other than your health, what else can I be concerned about?”

After Qiao Nian spoke, her beautiful fox-like eyes narrowed slightly. Her gaze traveled down Gu Zhou’s sexy Adam’s apple and gradually moved downwards. She couldn’t help but recall the scene when Gu Zhou was bathing on the mountain. She thought of his perfect and sexy figure and felt her mouth go dry.
