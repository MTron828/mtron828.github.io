1326 Cried

When Old Master Qin heard Gu Yue’s words, he heaved a sigh of relief and nodded. “Okay, go ahead. I’ll guard Chang Feng.”

With that, Old Master Qin sat beside Chang Feng’s bed and stared unblinkingly at him.

Gu Yue walked out of the ward. He turned back to look at Old Master Qin and Chang Feng, his eyes gradually becoming firm.

…

In the morning.

Qiao Nian returned to the hotel early in the morning. She heard from Lu Jiang that Xiao Bao was still unconscious, so she sat outside and waited.

Seeing the fatigue in Qiao Nian’s eyes, Lu Jiang frowned slightly and asked worriedly, “I heard from Qin Chuan that you were even attacked in the hospital yesterday?”

Qiao Nian briefly explained what had happened. Of course, she hid the matter about Chang Feng. She wasn’t worried that Fourth Brother would leak the secret, but she felt that there were too many people in the hotel and that the walls had ears.

After Lu Jiang heard this, he frowned and said in a low voice, “MY is really too dangerous. You should go back early.”

As Lu Jiang spoke, he took out his phone. “I’ll get my private plane to send you back.”

“Fourth Brother, I have other things to do now. I might have to go back later.” At this point, Qiao Nian paused for a moment and continued, “Moreover, Gu Zhou’s health isn’t good now. It’s not good for him to recuperate on the plane. After some time, his condition will stabilize. We’ll go back then.”

Just as Lu Jiang was about to say something, he met Qiao Nian’s firm gaze and knew that he couldn’t persuade her. He nodded and said, “Alright!”

Qiao Nian glanced at her watch. She didn’t want to wait outside anymore. She wanted to ask Xiao Bao for his previous address as soon as he woke up. She smiled at Lu Jiang and said, “Fourth Brother, I’ll go in and see Xiao Bao first. Go ahead. I’ll tell you if there’s anything.”

Lu Jiang knew that Qiao Nian was no longer a child. She had her own plans. He nodded and walked out.

Qiao Nian walked into the bedroom of the hotel. She gently pushed the door open and walked to the bed quietly. When she saw Xiao Bao’s quiet sleeping face, her restless heart gradually calmed down.

At this moment, Xiao Bao frowned. He lay on his left side, curled up into a ball, and called out in a childish voice, “Daddy…”

He sounded a little helpless and very uneasy.

Qiao Nian sat by the bed. She knew that Xiao Bao was having a nightmare. She gently patted his back and pulled him into her arms.

Xiao Bao suddenly opened his eyes and subconsciously called out, “Daddy…”

Xiao Bao sensed that he was being hugged and snuggled into Qiao Nian’s arms. “Daddy, I just…”

Before Xiao Bao could finish speaking, he suddenly felt that this embrace was a little strange. He smelled it and realized that it wasn’t Gu Yue’s scent. He instantly sobered up and immediately retreated. “Who is it?”

Seeing how wary Xiao Bao was, Qiao Nian raised her eyebrows slightly and asked with concern, “Xiao Bao, did Mommy disturb you from sleeping?”

When Xiao Bao saw Qiao Nian’s face, his expression faltered slightly.

In the past, he hoped to wake up in the morning and see his mommy’s face.

When he saw Qiao Nian beside him, his lips curved up slightly. He burrowed into Qiao Nian’s arms and smelled her scent. There was a gentle smile on his face. “Mommy, you smell so good.”

Although he was very happy now, his heart was a little empty. His mind was filled with thoughts of Daddy and Uncle Feng.

If Daddy sent him to Mommy now, would he be sad?

It was morning. Daddy should have woken up by now. Was he sitting in the study reading the newspaper like before and waiting for him to wake up for dinner?

Was Uncle Chang Feng sitting in the living room and scrolling through his cell phone after practicing Taiji three times?

Xiao Bao lowered his gaze slightly. At the thought that he might not be able to see Daddy and Uncle Feng in the future, his eyes couldn’t help but turn red. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He hoped that his family could be together. He didn’t want to choose between his mommy and daddy.

The more Xiao Bao thought about it, the sadder he became. He began to sob softly.

Although Qiao Nian had already given birth to three children, her experience with children was basically zero. Seeing that Xiao Bao was crying, she panicked and asked worriedly, “Xiao Bao, are you feeling unwell? Am I crushing you?”
