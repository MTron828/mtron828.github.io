Chapter 1765 - 1765 Revenge

Not only because Chen Sheng had hit the nail on the head, but also because he was indignant.

If that person wasn’t cold-blooded and heartless, why would he leave his wife?

Cui Huai looked at Chen Sheng in front of him and said with a serious expression, “I never thought of letting him off. He caused me so much trouble. The reason why I’ve been cooped up in MY is to take revenge and seek justice for the Cui family.”𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“I want to question the President personally. Why did he order the massacre of our Cui family? Has he had nightmares for years? I would have gone through fire and water for him. How did he treat me? I’ll definitely cut off his head with my own hands!”

In so many years, this was the first time he had personally said his wish. He had waited too long, and this was the first time he had mentioned these things to an outsider.

A brilliant light burst out of his old eyes, illuminating his entire face.

However, when he thought of what Mark had said to him a few days ago, the light in his eyes disappeared bit by bit, and his brows furrowed again.

He frowned in frustration and tried to suppress the anger in his chest. However, the thought of revenge took root in his heart like a seed.

“But I still have to wait for the opportunity…” Cui Huai frowned tightly. He pursed his lips tightly and his voice was a little hesitant. “Back then, I was just a small soldier. All these years, I already rushed to the front when it came to killing enemies. It wasn’t easy for me to climb to the position of general, but the previous family annihilation set me back to my original state. I worked hard again and finally climbed to my current position.”

“I really can’t wait anymore, but…” Cui Huai wished he could kill the president now, but he couldn’t. Mark had told him to wait a little longer and said that now wasn’t a good time.

“Boss, don’t hesitate. Let’s do it now!” Chen Sheng looked at Cui Huai in front of him passionately and generously, his eyes extremely sincere. “I think you’ve heard of the current situation in Europe, right? There’s a fierce battle in the European royal family. There’s a good saying. When the sandpiper and the clam fight, the fisherman reaps the benefits. We’re the fisherman now. If we miss this opportunity, I don’t know when we’ll be able to take revenge!”

Cui Huai did not speak. He only narrowed his eyes and looked at Chen Sheng in front of him. He did not let go, as if he was thinking about something.

After a long time, Cui Huai’s voice turned cold as he asked, “Chen Sheng, doing that with me is a rebellion. That’s a capital crime. It’s very likely that we won’t be able to come back!”

Previously, when he wanted to go to Europe, he never planned on returning.

He was taking revenge for himself, but Chen Sheng was different. If Chen Sheng stayed in MY, he could live a better life. There was no need for him to commit a capital crime because of him!

However, Chen Sheng already knew that he was Cui Si. If Chen Sheng wanted to leave, he would definitely not let him off. This was because Chen Sheng was not in the same boat as him. In order to hide his identity, he could only let Chen Sheng die.

With this thought in mind, Cui Huai gestured for the sniper hiding in the dark to prepare to shoot Chen Sheng.

Chen Sheng frowned and said disapprovingly, “Boss, you’re wrong to say that. If you hadn’t helped me, I might have died in the underground boxing arena back then, or even worse. It’s even more impossible for me to have such a good life. Boss, I’m very grateful for everything you gave me.”

“I don’t have any relatives. My life belongs to Boss. You just said that if I go to Europe with you, it’s a capital offense and we might not be able to come back. We do this every day. What’s there to be afraid of? Besides, it’s my honor to be able to fight alongside Boss.”

“Boss, you’re underestimating yourself. All these years, your decisions have never been wrong. If I follow you, I’ll definitely be able to do something big.”

“Okay!” Cui Huai slammed the table excitedly and looked at Chen Sheng hot-bloodedly. “Don’t worry, I’ll believe you in the future. I’ll also take back the people I placed beside you to monitor you previously!”

Chen Sheng’s eyes shone brightly, and the smile on his face became brighter and brighter. “Boss, when do we start?”
