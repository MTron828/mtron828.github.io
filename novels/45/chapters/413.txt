Chapter 414: Rescue

“Miss Qiao, how was your rest last night?”

Suddenly, a deep and mellow voice came from behind.

Qiao Nian was slightly taken aback. She turned around and saw the elegant smile on Mr. Chen’s face, which made it impossible for her to feel any disgust.

It was precisely because of this that Qiao Nian felt that Mr. Chen was very dangerous.

When Mr. Chen had spoken just now, she had thought that it was Gu Zhou. His voice was very similar to Gu Zhou’s, but if one listened carefully, they could still tell the difference.

Mr. Chen’s voice was a little hoarse, while Gu Zhou’s voice was as clear as wine.

Moreover, Gu Zhou wouldn’t call her Miss Qiao.

Seeing Qiao Nian’s dazed expression, Mr. Chen took a step back and distanced himself from her. “I’m sorry. Did I scare you?”

Although Mr. Chen spoke elegantly, Qiao Nian did not dare to let her guard down.

Qiao Nian shook her head and said, “No.”

“Nian Nian.”

At this moment, a cold voice sounded from the side.

Qiao Nian tilted her head and saw Lu Zhu walking towards her.

Qiao Nian had a strange feeling in her heart, and a warm feeling flowed through her. Usually, Lu Zhu wouldn’t call her that.

She really liked it when Lu Zhu called her that.

Lu Zhu walked up to Qiao Nian with a gentle smile on his face. “I’ve been looking for you for a while. So you’re here. You didn’t cause any trouble for Mr. Chen, did you?”

As she spoke, Lu Zhu stood between Qiao Nian and Mr. Chen.

When Mr. Chen heard Lu Zhu’s words, he said with a gentle smile, “No. Besides, it’s my honor to greet the beautiful Miss Qiao!”

Lu Zhu looked at Qiao Nian gently, his voice filled with affection. “You must be hungry now. I’ve already ordered breakfast for you!”

Qiao Nian nodded gently.

Lu Zhu raised his arm slightly. Qiao Nian instantly understood and held his arm.

“Alright, let’s go eat now!” With that, Lu Zhu was about to lead Qiao Nian to the dining room when he remembered that Mr. Chen was also there. He turned to look at Mr. Chen and asked with a smile, “Mr. Chen, shall we have breakfast together?”

“Thank you for your kindness, Mr. Lu. I’ve already eaten.”

Lu Zhu nodded and left with Qiao Nian. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Qiao Nian was acutely aware that Mr. Chen’s gaze was fixed on her.

The pressure of being stared at made her feel a little uneasy. It was only when Lu Zhu led her to the corner that the uneasiness gradually disappeared.

At this moment, Lu Zhu also stopped. His gentleness and doting expression instantly disappeared.

Qiao Nian didn’t feel awkward at all. She knew that Lu Zhu had only done that to help her out.

Lu Zhu looked at Qiao Nian and said stiffly, “Please forgive me for offending you just now!”

If Old Madam Gu and Gu Zhou hadn’t reminded him to take good care of Qiao Nian, he wouldn’t have bothered with her.

Qiao Nian said sincerely, “Thank you!”

“In the future, try your best to stay by my side and not wander around.”

Qiao Nian nodded slightly.

Although she was not afraid of Mr. Chen, he looked at her strangely and she could not put her finger on it.

The less trouble, the better.

Only then did Lu Zhu say, “But it’s about to start. I can’t take care of you all the time. Ah Zhou has even arranged a bodyguard for you. I’ll bring you to see him later!”

Hearing Lu Zhu’s words, Qiao Nian’s heart warmed. She hadn’t expected Gu Zhou to arrange a bodyguard for her. She really hadn’t expected him to be such a warm man.

Qiao Nian smiled and replied, “Okay.”

When Qiao Nian smiled, her cunning fox eyes curved into crescents. She looked adorable, and the charm that exuded from her eyes made one want to make a mistake.

Lu Zhu was slightly taken aback. When Qiao Nian smiled, she actually looked a lot like Lu Qi. His expression instantly turned cold as he said, “In the future, there’s no need to put on makeup on such occasions. Don’t smile at anyone!”
