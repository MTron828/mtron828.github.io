All good things must come to an end.

Mr. Chen let out a long sigh. He closed his eyes and opened them again. His eyes were calm as he turned around and walked out.

He walked out and saw Chang Feng standing in the corridor with his head lowered, his eyes red-rimmed.

Mr. Chen gently patted Chang Feng’s shoulder and said, “Perhaps he’s safer there.”

Chang Feng pursed his lips and looked into Mr. Chen’s eyes. After a long time, he said, “Yes.”

Mr. Chen gave a faint smile and retracted his gaze from Chang Feng’s face. His voice was slightly low. “Take him there. I won’t go.”

With that, Mr. Chen walked forward without looking back.

Chang Feng stood alone. He looked at Mr. Chen’s retreating back that seemed to be a little more lonely than usual.

He had watched Xiao Bao grow up with his own eyes. He couldn’t bear for Xiao Bao to leave.

Mr. Chen was related to Xiao Bao by blood. He felt that Mr. Chen would prefer to raise Xiao Bao.

But in their current situation, it was no longer safe for Xiao Bao to stay with them.

Even if he didn’t send Xiao Bao back this time, if Xiao Bao contacted Little Junior Sister in the future and Old Master Cui’s people found out, the problem would be huge. Master’s many years of planning would be wasted.

Chang Feng sighed slightly. He only hoped that Master would be able to accept it.

…

Qiao Nian turned off the game and sent Chang Feng a message on her phone, asking him about the child.

Gu Zhou had been sitting beside Qiao Nian the entire time. Seeing that Qiao Nian was anxious and wanted to send another message to Chang Feng, he took Qiao Nian’s phone away and sighed. “Don’t be anxious. The situation on Chang Feng’s side is complicated. We have to be calm. We can’t cause them trouble.”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she felt like a deflated balloon. She sat on the spot weakly and said, “I understand. I was just too anxious just now.”

Gu Zhou hugged Qiao Nian tightly and gently planted a kiss on her forehead. “I understand!”

Qiao Nian’s eyes turned red. She had to believe Eldest Senior Brother. Eldest Senior Brother would definitely give her an accurate answer.

About an hour later, Qiao Nian’s phone suddenly lit up.

Qiao Nian’s eyes lit up. She gripped her cell phone tightly and anxiously deciphered the string of codes.

Ten o’clock tomorrow morning, under the roller coaster at the amusement park in Yangon.

Qiao Nian wrote the translated words on a piece of paper. Her heart was beating violently, and her hand, which was holding the paper, was trembling.

She handed the paper in her hand to Gu Zhou, her eyes filled with a happy smile. “Tomorrow, we’ll be able to see our child tomorrow!”

Gu Zhou held Qiao Nian’s hand tightly. Her hand was trembling, and so was her entire body. He pulled her into his arms and lowered his head to kiss her forehead. He said softly, “Yes, our family can finally be reunited!”

Qiao Nian leaned into Gu Zhou’s arms, tears flowing down her face.

She still remembered that after she gave birth, she lay alone on the hospital bed and saw the two dead babies by the bed. At that time, she was completely disheartened and yearned to die with her children. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

That heartache was still there.

She had never expected that after the tables had turned, her children would still be alive.

Qiao Nian didn’t sleep much that night. Her mind was filled with images of that child.

Qiao Nian wasn’t the only one who couldn’t sleep. Gu Zhou hadn’t slept well either.

The next day, the two of them went to the amusement park early.

Qiao Nian glanced at the watch on her wrist. There was still an hour before the agreed time. She had come early because she was afraid that she would be late. What if she missed her child?

Qiao Nian stood nervously by the roller coaster and waited. She looked around, afraid that she would miss any detail.

At this moment, Chang Feng was standing in a shopping mall opposite the amusement park with Xiao Bao. Holding a telescope with both hands, Chang Feng looked at Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou in the waiting area beside the roller coaster. His grip on the telescope tightened involuntarily.

Xiao Bao, who was standing beside Chang Feng, looked up at him with a bright smile. “Uncle Feng, has Mommy arrived?”
