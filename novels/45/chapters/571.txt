Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion. She didn’t understand why Gu Zhou didn’t want her to leave. Had she said something wrong?

Gu Zhou’s gaze lingered on Qiao Nian’s face, his eyes filled with confusion. He asked, “Have you ever thought that your request would be unfair to you?”

A trace of shock flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes. Her beautiful fox-like eyes curved up as she said, “I’m an adult and a doctor. I should take care of a sick child. Is there a problem?”

Gu Zhou thought that there was nothing wrong with Qiao Nian’s words. However, Qiao Nian was really indifferent. She was still unwilling to admit that they were married.

Seeing that Gu Zhou’s expression was getting worse and worse, Qiao Nian tried to speak as gently as possible. She asked softly, “Gu Zhou, what’s wrong?”

Gu Zhou remained silent. He lowered his gaze, as if he was thinking about something. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qiao Nian wanted to retract her hand, but Gu Zhou was holding on too tightly. She called out tentatively, “Gu Zhou?”

However, she still didn’t receive a response. Gu Chuan’s face flashed before Qiao Nian’s eyes. Her heart jumped to her throat and she called out carefully, “Gu Chuan?”

At this moment, Gu Zhou finally reacted. He looked up at Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian was so frightened that her heart was about to jump out of her throat.

Oh my god!

He had really become Gu Chuan!

It was over. Gu Chuan was the most terrifying of the three personalities.

“How did you—”

Before Qiao Nian could finish speaking, Gu Zhou interrupted her. “Who’s Gu Chuan?”

When Qiao Nian heard this, she was slightly stunned. She looked at Gu Zhou in confusion.

Huh?

This voice and tone did not sound like Gu Chuan at all. It was clearly Gu Zhou.

So Gu Chuan had not come out.

Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. A bright smile appeared on her face as she said, “I called you by the wrong name just now. I’m sorry.”

Gu Zhou frowned at Qiao Nian, clearly not believing her words.

Gu Chuan?

This name sounded like a man’s name, but Gu Chuan didn’t seem to exist in his memory.

When did Qiao Nian meet him?

However, there was something strange. The name Gu Chuan sounded a little familiar.

He seemed to know this person too.

At the thought of this, Gu Zhou felt a sense of danger.

Gu Zhou’s frown deepened.

The uneasiness in Qiao Nian’s heart gradually grew. She frowned and said softly, “Um, don’t think about it anymore. Why don’t you go and tell Grandma about this now?”

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian with a burning gaze, unblinking. “Gu Chuan… Who is he?”

Qiao Nian was dumbfounded.

How could she explain?

Gu Chuan and Zhou Zhou were all him!

If she said that, Gu Zhou would probably think that she was the one who was sick.

“I just accidentally called you by the wrong name. Why are you thinking so much? Alright, hurry up and get back to work. What if you miss out on something?” Qiao Nian hurriedly urged.

Gu Zhou pursed his lips. When he thought of how she had been considerate of Little Qi previously, he had a strange feeling.

If he asked for a divorce now, Qiao Nian might agree without hesitation.

Gu Zhou’s dark eyes grew darker and darker, the light gradually fading. “Qiao Nian.”

Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat. She wanted to retract her hand, but Gu Zhou was holding on too tightly.

The spot he was holding was faintly burning. His voice sounded a little hoarse, but there was a hint of sexiness in it. She couldn’t help but be tempted.

“Huh?” Qiao Nian swallowed.

“I remember when we first got together, you mentioned a contract marriage?”

Qiao Nian looked puzzled, but she still nodded obediently. “Yes.”

Actually, she still wanted Gu Zhou to sign the marriage contract!
