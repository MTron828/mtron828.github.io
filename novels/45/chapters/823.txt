824 Thinking of a Way Out

Qiao Nian frowned. The image of Xiao Shi’s cute face appeared in her mind, and her heart ached involuntarily.

Xiao Shi was a lively and cheerful child. Her negative emotions seemed to have come from Song Man.

Qiao Nian didn’t understand. Song Man had such an obedient daughter. Why wasn’t she satisfied?

If her child was still alive, she would definitely do her best to take care of it. She would never let her child suffer any grievances.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Qi and said, “Don’t worry, nothing will happen to her. If her life isn’t good, we can think of a way to get your father to fight for her custody. When the time comes, she’ll live with you. I’ll take good care of her too. Don’t worry!”

When Gu Qi heard Qiao Nian’s words, his heart, which had been in his throat, gradually relaxed. He hoped that his sister could live with him as soon as possible.

…

At the Dongjiang villa.

When Xiao Shi stood at the entrance of the villa, more than an hour had passed since he had spoken to Qiao Nian on the phone.

Xiao Shi stood there with a frown. At the thought that her mommy might have flared up at Brother Xiao Qi, the light in his eyes gradually disappeared, and she couldn’t help but sigh.

After a long while, Xiao Shi knocked on the door.

Soon, the door opened.

When Song Man saw Xiao Shi, she could only see Xiao Shi’s furry head and not her expression.

Song Man glanced outside and did not see anyone else.

It seemed that Qiao Nian hadn’t come.

Song Man heaved a sigh of relief. She looked at Xiao Shi with a complicated expression and closed her eyes slightly. When she opened them again, her eyes were already red.

“Xiao Shi!” Song Man called Xiao Shi’s name. She squatted down and hugged Xiao Shi, pretending to be guilty. “I’m sorry, I’m really sorry. It’s Mommy’s fault. I shouldn’t have lost my temper at you. Mommy already knows her mistake. Mommy regrets it very much. Can you forgive Mommy?”

When she heard Song Man’s words, she was stunned. She muttered, “Mommy…”

When Song Man heard Xiao Shi call her that, she knew that Xiao Shi was no longer angry with her. However, this was a critical moment. She wanted all the dissatisfaction in Xiao Shi’s heart to disappear.

“Xiao Shi, Mommy knows her mistake. Mommy will never hit you again. I’m really sorry. Mommy was too angry just now and didn’t know what she had done. Xiao Shi, can you not be angry with Mommy?” Song Man said pitifully.

Xiao Shi stood rooted to the ground, her face turning paler and paler. Her eyes couldn’t help but turn red, and tears welled up in her eyes.

Did Mommy just say that she had hit her?

How could Mommy hit her brother?

Brother had always thought of Mommy and wanted to be with her.

Her brother had wanted to gradually get familiar with her mommy. Why had it suddenly become like this?

Was her brother very sad?

Xiao Shi bit her lip. For the first time, she did not want to forgive her mommy.

In the past, every time Mommy made a mistake or hit her, she would hug her like this, repenting and begging for her forgiveness.

Other than that, Mommy rarely hugged her. The only time she really hugged her was when she left.

She could understand her mommy’s mood swings and how she could not control her emotions sometimes.

She was a burden to Mommy.

If Mommy had not chosen to give birth to her back then, Mommy would not have lived in the slums, worked hard to earn money, and fallen ill.

It was very likely that Mommy would find a rich family to marry and live a happy life.

But her mother’s happy life had all been disrupted by her. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

All of this had nothing to do with her brother.

Why did Mommy hit her brother?

Her brother was innocent!

Xiao Shi lowered her gaze sadly. After some thought, she pushed Song Man away solemnly.

Song Man froze.

Those beautiful eyes looked at Xiao Shi in disbelief.

In the past, when she apologized to Xiao Shi, Xiao Shi would forgive her.

Why had it changed now?

“Xiao…” Song Man called out, wanting to confirm her thoughts.
