Chapter 210: Crystal Cup

He had been driving very fast just now. If it were anyone else, they would have probably been screaming the whole journey.

This thought flashed through Chen Qing’s mind for only a second. He led Qiao Nian inside.

Qiao Nian didn’t expect the Gu family to have a small, old-fashioned courtyard. As soon as she walked in, the fragrance wafted over.

The sun was shining brightly. Everywhere she looked, she could only see greenery and flowers. It made one feel as though they were in some sort of paradise.

They walked through the garden and arrived at a small hut. There, they saw Gu Zhou lying on a recliner, his face pale. It was unclear if he was dead or alive.

There were scattered flowers, red wine, Western food, and some fruits on the ground beside Gu Zhou.

Qiao Nian’s expression changed drastically. In the past, when Gu Zhou’s illness flared up, he could still control himself.

However, this time round, Gu Zhou had evidently lost control of himself. That must be why he was smashing things.

She stepped forward, pulled a chair close to Gu Zhou, and began to take his pulse.

Gu Zhou’s white shirt had already been stained red by the red wine. The top two buttons of his shirt seemed to have been pulled off. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Gu Zhou,” Qiao Nian called out softly.

However, Gu Zhou did not react at all.

If Qiao Nian hadn’t been able to feel Gu Zhou’s weak pulse, she might have thought that he was already dead.

They were in the mountains, and there was a strong breeze everywhere. If a healthy person came here, they would probably feel warm and comfortable, but Gu Zhou’s health was not suitable for this place.

If she wasn’t wrong, Gu Zhou’s illness had flared up because of the strong wind.

Qiao Nian noted this down. She would remind Gu Zhou about this in the future. Turning to look at Chen Qing, she asked in confusion, “Why is he here?”

Chen Qing looked embarrassed. He stammered, “I…”

How should he put it?

Chen Qing felt a little awkward.

Second Young Master wanted to prepare a birthday surprise for Second Young Madam.

If Young Master were to know that Chen Qing had told Young Madam about this, he would definitely seek revenge from him!

Qiao Nian retracted her hand from Gu Zhou’s pulse. Chen Qing hadn’t replied for a long time, and she couldn’t be bothered to ask further. The most important thing now was to stabilize Gu Zhou’s condition. She hurriedly said to Chen Qing, “Come and help me. Help him into the house!”

Chen Qing immediately stepped forward to help.

Qiao Nian and Chen Qing had just helped Gu Zhou up when Gu Zhou’s eyes flew open.

His gaze was like a lake in the depths of winter, his eyes as cold as ice.

Seeing that Gu Zhou had woken up, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but smile. “Gu Zhou, you’re finally awake. You…”

Before Qiao Nian could finish her sentence, Gu Zhou flung Qiao Nian and Chen Qing away, seemingly unconscious of what he was doing.

“Gu Zhou!” Qiao Nian called out anxiously.

Gu Zhou’s red eyes were fixed on the last cup on the table. He clenched his fists tightly, his nails digging into his palms.

Qiao Nian followed Gu Zhou’s gaze. She knew in her heart that Gu Zhou wanted to continue smashing things. She hurriedly stepped forward and picked up the glass on the table, preparing to hand it to Gu Zhou!

But when her hand touched the cup, her hand froze.

This cup felt different from ordinary cups. It seemed to be made of crystal!

The sunlight fell on the crystal cup, refracting light of all colors. It was so beautiful that one could not take their eyes off it.

Crystal cups were so expensive!

Wouldn’t it be a pity if such a valuable cup was broken?

A trace of reluctance flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes.

However, when she saw how Gu Zhou was suppressing his urges, she couldn’t bear to stop him. She handed the crystal cup to Gu Zhou and said softly, “If you want to smash it, then do so!”

Gu Zhou grabbed the cup. Just as he was about to fling it away, he seemed to sense that something was different about this cup. The cloudiness in his eyes gradually dissipated.

His brow was furrowed tightly, and he looked like he was in pain. He stared at the cup in his hand, then placed it on the table, looking as though that simple act had taken all of his self-control. Then, in pain, he squatted on the ground with his head in his hands.

Chen Qing looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief, his eyes filled with astonishment.

How could Second Young Master put the crystal cup back on the table when he was in such a state? He had been practically unconscious of his surroundings!

This crystal cup seemed to be extremely important to Second Young Master!

And, this crystal cup was a gift Second Young Master had prepared for Second Young Madam!
