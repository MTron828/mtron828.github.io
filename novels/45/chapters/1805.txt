Chapter 1806 - 1806 Admittance

Lina heaved a sigh of relief. “That’s good.”

“Your mother knows that Mark has already fallen. She told me that she wants to go home, but the situation in Europe has just stabilized. I can’t accompany her back…” When the President said this, his eyes gradually darkened.

When Lina heard the President say this, she smiled and hugged him. She said gently, “Mom knows what’s most important now. She understands you.”

The President nodded slightly, but he still felt a little regretful. He said, “Actually, I want to go back with her. But after thinking about it, your mother hasn’t been home for so many years, so I’ll leave this matter to you. Go back with her. Coincidentally, you’ll go with Mr. Gu and Miss Qiao this time. With them around, you’ll definitely be very safe.”

Lina also agreed with the President. Thinking that Mr. Gu and Nian Nian had directly subdued Mark, her admiration for them increased. “Dad, don’t worry. I’ll definitely take good care of Mom.”

Chen Qing, who was beside her, struggled to stand up. Seeing this, Lina hurriedly helped Chen Qing sit on the bed and lowered her voice. “Don’t move around.”

“It’s fine.” Chen Qing looked at Lina in front of him with a smile in his eyes. When his gaze shifted to the president, there was only seriousness left. “Don’t worry, I’ll definitely complete the highest-level mission of protecting their safety.”

The President was slightly stunned. Then, he frowned and said in a low voice, “This is what you should do in the first place. You can’t say that it’s a mission!”

The president looked at Chen Qing in front of him. It was Chen Qing’s duty to protect his future wife and mother if he wanted to be his son-in-law.

Chen Qing subconsciously said that it was a mission. It could be seen that Chen Qing had never come into contact with these things before. He should have been nurtured into a bodyguard.

Chen Qing was stunned for a moment. Suddenly, as if he had been enlightened, his eyes lit up. “Thank you for your teachings, Mr. President. I was wrong. This is what I should have done in the first place. I was stupid. I hope you can enlighten me.”

When Lina heard Chen Qing’s words, she smiled brightly. “Are you stupid? I don’t think you’re stupid, especially when you were fighting and lying to me.”

When Chen Qing heard Lina’s words, he subconsciously wanted to say, “You were too innocent and gullible!”

However, the president was still here. It was not appropriate for him to say this. He looked at Lina and did not say anything.

The President looked at Lina and Chen Qing’s eyes and smiled slightly.

When Lina was with Chen Qing, she was as playful as the other girls.

“This time, I’m here to thank you for taking the knife for me.” The president looked at Chen Qing.

Chen Qing immediately sat up straight. “Mr. President, this is what I should do.”

Lina: You’re learning for practical uses.

“Alright, Lina, stay behind and take care of him. I’ll go back first,” the president said and turned to open the door.

Lina quickly walked to the president’s side and personally sent him out.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

After the president left, Lina walked to Chen Qing’s side with a straight face and asked seriously, “Do you know what you did wrong?”

Chen Qing did not react for a moment.

“My father has already agreed to our relationship. Why are you still calling him Mr. President?” Lina asked angrily with one hand on her hip.

Chen Qing quickly reacted and asked seriously, “Should I call him father-in-law now?”

Lina blushed instantly. “No, you misunderstood.”

“What should I call him?”

“You have to start from Uncle,” Lina muttered softly.

…

At this moment, outside the hospital.

Qiao Nian had just hung up on Chang Feng. From the phone, she knew that Eldest Senior Brother’s plane would take off in an hour and a half. If she rushed to the airport now, she could still see him.

Qiao Nian ran out of the palace and looked at the cars coming and going in front of her. She wanted to take a taxi, but she couldn’t stop a car.
