Su Yan frowned and said worriedly, “I just hope to be with you.”

Thank you readers!

“Mom, the situation at home is also very critical. If she’s really in the Lu family, she might do something outrageous. You have to protect the family well.” Qiao Nian looked at Su Yan reluctantly. Actually, she didn’t want to be separated from Su Yan either, but MY was too dangerous. She didn’t want her mother to be in any danger. “Not only does MY have Gu Zhou, but Qin Chuan and Jiang Chi are also my good friends. They’ll protect me well, and I’ll protect myself too. I won’t let myself be hurt.”

Su Yan held Qiao Nian’s hand tightly and had no choice but to nod. Her eyes were slightly red.

Now that the situation was critical, she had no choice but to let her daughter leave her again.

…

At the Gu family villa.

Gu Zhou parked the car in the parking lot and the two of them got out.

Matriarch Gu was sitting in the living room watching television. When she saw the two of them return, a loving smile appeared on her face.

“Nian Nian, are you very happy to find your family? What did you talk about yesterday?” Matriarch Gu asked gently.

Qiao Nian recounted what had happened yesterday, as well as Dr. Shen’s death. She glanced at Gu Zhou, then her gaze fell on Matriarch Gu’s face again.

“Grandma, we have something to discuss with you.” Qiao Nian looked at Matriarch Gu intently and said gently.

When Matriarch Gu heard Qiao Nian’s words, she reached out and held her hand. Smiling, she said, “I know you must have a lot of things to do now. Do whatever you want. I’ll take good care of the children at home and help you guard the house.”

“We want to go to MY,” Qiao Nian said in a low voice. That country was relatively chaotic. If it weren’t for the fact that they were investigating the truth, they wouldn’t be willing to go there.

On the way back, Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou had already discussed it. They would never tell Matriarch Gu that the eldest young master of the Gu family had once appeared in MY.

They were afraid that Matriarch Gu might be disappointed again.

Matriarch Gu looked at Qiao Nian lovingly and nodded, looking like she understood. “Nian Nian, Grandma is getting old now and doesn’t know how to help you. When you and Ah Zhou go there, you have to be careful. You’re the most important people to me. As long as you’re alive, Grandma will be happy!”

Qiao Nian’s eyes couldn’t help but turn red. She hugged Matriarch Gu and said gently, “Grandma, don’t worry. We’ll definitely be fine!”

Matriarch Gu couldn’t help but give Qiao Nian a few more reminders. After letting go of Qiao Nian, her gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face, and her expression instantly turned serious. “Ah Zhou!”

“Grandma!” As Gu Zhou spoke, he sat up straight, preparing to listen to Matriarch Gu’s lecture.

Matriarch Gu looked at Gu Zhou. She still remembered the thin and weak Ah Zhou when he was young. In the blink of an eye, he had already started a family.

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. She was the person he doted on the most. How could he let her be hurt?

“Okay!” Gu Zhou replied with certainty.

When Matriarch Gu heard Gu Zhou’s words, she nodded and looked at Qiao Nian reluctantly. “Alright, you can go!”

“Yes!”

Holding Qiao Nian’s hand, Gu Zhou walked out. Before the two of them walked out of the living room, Xiao Shi’s voice came from the stairs.

“Mommy, Daddy!”

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian stopped in their tracks and turned around. The two of them saw Xiao Shi and Gu Qi standing at the stairs.

A trace of guilt flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes. Previously, she had always wanted to take good care of the children, but after she reunited with them, she had no choice but to leave them because of other matters.

She had yet to fulfill her duty as a mother.

She wondered what would happen in MY. She didn’t know if she would be able to find her third child when she went out this time.

Gu Qi and Xiao Shi walked down the stairs and ran up to them.

Qiao Nian looked at the two similar faces. She squatted down and pulled the two children into her arms. Her eyes couldn’t help but turn red. She was silent for a long time.
