821 Can You Call Me Mommy?

Qiao Nian didn’t want Gu Qi to feel uncomfortable. She picked him up and placed him in the front passenger seat. She bent down and helped Gu Qi fasten his seatbelt.

She looked down and gently ruffled Gu Qi’s hair. She said gently, “Our Xiao Qi is as handsome and good-looking as ever!”

When Gu Qi heard Qiao Nian’s words, he looked up at her. His dark eyes gradually lit up. He pursed his lips and asked carefully, “Auntie Nian Nian!”

“In Auntie Nian Nian’s heart, you’re the most obedient and best child. Be good! When I apply the medicine later, your face won’t hurt anymore.” With that, Qiao Nian was about to close the passenger door when Gu Qi grabbed her hand.

Qiao Nian thought that Gu Qi was still sad that Song Man had hit him. She comforted him. “Actually, it’s very normal for people to argue with each other. As long as you think you’re not in the wrong, don’t mind it too much.”

Gu Qi stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian and asked uneasily, “Auntie Nian Nian… can I call you Mommy?”

Gu Qi’s voice was no longer as calm as usual, nor was it as cool as his usual childish voice. His voice was soft now, mixed with caution and fear.

At this moment, Gu Qi looked insecure. His doggy eyes were bright, as if he was worried that he would be abandoned.

Hearing Gu Qi’s voice, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but feel terrible.

In the past, Gu Qi had never had such a gaze or spoken in such a tone.

Gu Qi must have been frightened by Song Man.

However, when she thought of Gu Qi’s words, she was stunned.

Gu Qi stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian. Seeing that Qiao Nian was standing there silently, his eyes gradually darkened.

He had thought that Qiao Nian wasn’t willing to be his mommy.

Biting his lip, he retracted his hand in disappointment.

Just as he was about to retract his hand, Qiao Nian grabbed it again.

Gu Qi looked at Qiao Nian in confusion. He felt Qiao Nian’s grip on his hand tighten.

Auntie Nian Nian’s hand was very warm. He couldn’t bear to let go.

He met Qiao Nian’s red eyes. He didn’t understand why Auntie Nian Nian was looking at him with such sadness and joy. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Before Gu Qi could ask, he was pulled into Qiao Nian’s arms.

Qiao Nian slowly closed her eyes. A tear fell from the corner of her eye.

It had been a long time since she had cried. She had almost forgotten what it felt like to cry.

However, she couldn’t bear to hear Gu Qi’s words and see his careful actions.

Qiao Nian hugged Gu Qi tightly, her voice choked. “Xiao Qi, in my heart, you’ve always been my child. I’m very happy that you’re willing to let me be your mommy. Thank you…”

Gu Qi listened to her voice and felt the warmth in Qiao Nian’s arms. This was how his mommy should be.

So the happiness he had always yearned for was beside him. It was just that he had been too obsessed with blood ties in the past.

Gu Qi reached out and hugged Qiao Nian, calling out, “Mommy…”

He had wanted to call Song Man like this before, but for some reason, he couldn’t.

Qiao Nian’s body stiffened, and her heart instantly softened. She felt a lump in her throat and nodded heavily. “Okay!”

Gu Qi felt his eyes heat up. She sniffed and called out again, “Mommy!”

This time, Gu Qi’s voice was much firmer than before. There was joy and happiness in his voice, indicating that he was really willing to let Qiao Nian be his mommy.

Qiao Nian nodded again.

Qiao Nian recalled the first time she had seen Gu Qi. He had disguised himself as a girl. At that time, she had felt that Gu Qi was a sweet and cool girl. At that time, she liked him a lot.

The second time she saw Gu Qi, he had been bullied by the school. She had stepped forward to stand up for him.

Later on, she realized that the Gu Qi she saw was completely different from the Gu Qi others were talking about.

Everyone felt that Gu Qi was sick, but only she felt that Gu Qi was just someone who was not good at expressing himself.
