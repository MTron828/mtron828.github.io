815 Mommy’s Life Isn’t Easy Too

When Gu Qi heard Song Man’s words, he recalled what Xiao Shi had told him.

Xiao Shi had said that his mommy had lost an arm, so her temper was a little bad. She had asked him to take care of her more.

Gu Qi recalled Song Man’s gentleness when she first arrived at the villa, her coldness after Qin Chuan and the others left, and now his heart was filled with guilt.

It seemed that her mood was really volatile.

Gu Qi roughly understood Song Man’s situation.

Mommy couldn’t control her emotions.

Gu Qi’s gaze landed on his mother’s broken arm and he sighed silently.

He could understand what his mommy was doing now.

It wasn’t easy for Mommy either.

Song Man let go of him. Her gaze was the same as when she first entered the room. She asked gently, “Xiao Shi, did you see your daddy? Did you acknowledge him?”

Gu Qi said, “I haven’t reunited with Daddy yet. I…”

When the car arrived at the Dongjiang villa, Song Man thought that she had already found her grandparents when she was young.

However, after she entered the villa, she realized that it was empty. There were only things for children and nothing for elderly people. In addition, Gu Qi had just mentioned Qiao Nian. She thought that she had already reunited with Gu Zhou.

Song Man couldn’t understand why Qiao Nian had sent her to the Dongjiang villa. What was her motive?

Previously, she had heard from others that Qiao Nian was very smart. Now, it seemed that she had to be fully alert.

“Why didn’t you acknowledge your daddy?” Song Man asked, looking at Xiao Shi coldly.

“I want to wait.”

Song Man looked puzzled. Puzzled, she asked, “Why wait? Perhaps your daddy misses you too. How can you bear to make him sad? Could it be that your Auntie Nian Nian won’t let you acknowledge your daddy?”

Gu Qi shook his head and said seriously, “I didn’t want to.”

When Song Man heard his words, her expression immediately darkened.

She must have been deceived by Qiao Nian’s sweet words, so she decided not to acknowledge her father.

Qiao Nian was really too cunning. She was so scheming. It seemed that she had to be more careful in the future, lest she be tricked by Qiao Nian.

Song Man’s expression darkened and her tone was cold. “Xiao Shi, we had a hard time living in Hai Cheng. Back then, I worked so hard to raise you because I hoped to find our family. Then, we wouldn’t have to work so hard in the future.”

“We were often bullied in Hai Cheng and have relied on each other until now. Mommy thought that we would all work hard to make each other happy. Why do you push happiness away?” Song Man’s frown deepened, and her voice became sharp.

When Gu Qi heard Song Man’s words, he felt more and more uncomfortable. He slowly lowered his eyes and his gaze inadvertently landed on Song Man’s remaining hand.

Her hands were fair and delicate, and her fingers were long and slender.

Such hands must not have done any heavy work. Gu Qi couldn’t help but frown.

He had seen Xiao Shi’s hands. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Xiao Shi’s hands were covered in scars and calluses. It was obvious that she had done a lot of work.

Why were Mommy’s hands smooth and delicate, but her hands were old and rough?

Gu Qi recalled what Song Man had just said. He had a strange feeling in his heart and muttered softly, “Do you just want to find Daddy and use him to let you live a luxurious life?”

Gu Qi didn’t understand. Didn’t one have to fight for a happy life?

Song Man’s expression changed drastically. Her heart jumped to her throat as she looked at him in shock.

How could this child be so sharp?

She was too smart!

However, she quickly calmed down. She had always been smarter and more sensible than others when she was young. It was normal for her to think of this.

Song Man hurriedly shook her head and explained eagerly, “When you were young, Mom felt sorry for you. You were the little princess of the Gu family to begin with. You should have been living a carefree life, but when you were in Hai Cheng with Mom, you had to live a poor life. Mom didn’t want you to live such a hard life for the rest of your life, do you understand?”

Gu Qi looked at Song Man expressionlessly, his heart gradually sinking to the bottom.
