862 Sleeping Pill?

She lifted Xiao Shi’s blanket and hugged her in her arms, walking out.

Seeing Qiao Nian’s actions, Song Man’s expression changed. She questioned, “What are you doing? Where are you taking Xiao Shi?”

Qiao Nian didn’t even give Song Man a look of charity. She looked at Gu Zhou and said seriously, “Xiao Shi’s condition isn’t good now. She seems to have taken a lot of sleeping pills to fall unconscious. We have to send her to the hospital quickly to pump her stomach.”

“What? How could this be? Did you say that on purpose to take Xiao Shi away?” Song Man frowned and asked unhappily.

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, his heart sank.

Hearing Song Man’s words, his cold gaze landed on her face, scaring her so much that she took a step back. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Song Man, how can you be so vicious? She’s still so young. How can you feed her so many sleeping pills!” Gu Zhou questioned coldly. His voice was low and hoarse, like a demon from hell.

Song Man looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief. She had never expected Gu Zhou to suspect her. No matter what, she was Xiao Shi’s mother. How could she do such a cruel thing to Xiao Shi?

“I didn’t!” Song Man frowned and said angrily, “You have no evidence. Why are you suspecting me!”

Seeing that Gu Zhou and Song Man still wanted to argue, Qiao Nian hurriedly said, “Ah Zhou, it’s getting late. If we delay any longer, it might be too late. We should send Xiao Shi to the hospital as soon as possible to pump her stomach!”

“Ah Zhou.” Just these two words instantly soothed Gu Zhou’s irritable mood.

Gu Zhou glanced at Song Man coldly, then went downstairs with Qiao Nian.

No matter what, Xiao Shi’s life was the most important.

As Gu Zhou walked downstairs, he called Chen Qing.

“Get the hospital in the city center to prepare the emergency bed at the entrance of the hospital and wait!”

With that, Gu Zhou hung up.

Although Chen Qing still didn’t understand what had happened, he hurriedly did as Gu Zhou said.

…

Twenty minutes later.

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian waited anxiously at the entrance of the emergency room. Xiao Shi had already been sent in by the doctor for a stomach pump.

Time passed bit by bit. Qiao Nian stood guard outside, hoping that Xiao Shi would recover soon.

Neither of them spoke. The corridor was extremely quiet.

Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou and saw him standing there coldly. His entire body was emitting a cold aura, and his hands were clenched tightly. His knuckles were white, and his veins were bulging ferociously, as if he was trying hard to control something.

Qiao Nian knew in her heart that Gu Zhou was worried about Xiao Shi.

She didn’t know if Xiao Shi would recover. She could only leave it to fate.

After some thought, she walked over to Gu Zhou and reached out to hold his hand.

When Gu Zhou realized that Qiao Nian was walking over, he grabbed her hand.

Gu Zhou was very strong. Qiao Nian’s hand hurt from his grip, but she didn’t say anything. Instead, she stood calmly beside Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou lowered his gaze and recalled how Xiao Shi had asked him to help with her homework that night.

“That night, I discovered something wrong with Xiao Qi. Why couldn’t I have thought more about it? If only I had discovered earlier that she was Xiao Shi and not Xiao Qi!”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, her heart sank. She said guiltily, “I’m really sorry. That day, I wanted you to interact with each other first. When you reunited later, things might work out better. I didn’t expect such a big accident!”

Qiao Nian was really worried.

If Xiao Shi was not saved, Xiao Shi might become Gu Zhou’s eternal regret.

She was the cause of this regret.

If her beloved daughter had always been by her side, but she didn’t recognize her, Qiao Nian would probably not be able to get over it like Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou naturally understood Qiao Nian’s worry. He held Qiao Nian’s hand tightly and said, “This has nothing to do with you. It’s all my fault. If I hadn’t been negligent and if I had discovered earlier that I still had a daughter, I could have brought her home earlier and this accident wouldn’t have happened! Then, I wouldn’t have any regrets!”
