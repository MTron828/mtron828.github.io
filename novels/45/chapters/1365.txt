1366 Confirmation

“Second Young Master…”

Before Chen Qing could finish speaking, Gu Zhou interrupted him with a frown and said, “Go and investigate Qin Chuan’s schedule now. If he’s in An City, see where his car was last seen in the surveillance cameras.”

Without hesitation, Chen Qing replied, “Yes, ma’am.” He quickly walked towards the study upstairs.

Although he didn’t know what had happened, he had already begun to investigate Qin Chuan.

Gu Zhou took a tissue from the side and carefully wiped the tears off Qiao Nian’s face. He comforted her softly, “Perhaps the two of them happened to be on a plane. When they are on a plane, there will be no signal on their phones. Don’t worry.”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she nodded slightly. However, she was feeling uneasy today and had even broken a beaker. Logically speaking, before the beaker fell to the ground, it was impossible for it to cut her hand. However, her hand had indeed been cut.

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze slightly, silently praying that Qin Chuan and Lu Qi weren’t in the Wang Village Tunnel.

When Chen Qing came downstairs, his expression was serious and his face was slightly pale.

When he investigated Qin Chuan’s path just now, he had also seen something about the collapse of the Wang Village tunnel. He didn’t know what to tell the clueless Young Madam.

When Qiao Nian heard Chen Qing’s footsteps, she looked up and saw him walking over. She looked at him nervously and asked anxiously, “Chen Qing, have you found out where Qin Chuan is now?”

Seeing Qiao Nian’s nervous expression, Chen Qing hesitated for a moment before comforting her. “Young Madam, don’t be agitated yet. Listen to me slowly…”

Qiao Nian looked at Chen Qing, the light in her eyes gradually disappearing. If Gu Zhou hadn’t been supporting her, she might have collapsed onto the sofa.

Chen Qing’s hesitant expression meant that Qin Chuan and Lu Qi were really in the Wang Village Tunnel.

Seeing this, Chen Qing hurriedly said, “Second Young Madam, I’ve also found out about the collapse of the Wang Village tunnel. It’s said that not the entire tunnel has collapsed. There are very few places that had collapsed. The entire tunnel is a total of ten kilometers. Perhaps Mr. Qin is in a place where the tunnel hasn’t collapsed, but the signal there isn’t good, so we can’t contact him.”

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze and clenched her fists tightly.

Her previous guess was right. Qin Chuan and Lu Qi were really in the Wang Village tunnel.

If only there were no tunnels on the highway to the village. They wouldn’t have encountered a tunnel collapse.

Gu Zhou reached out and held Qiao Nian’s hand. Qiao Nian’s hand was very cold. He pulled her hand into his arms, as if he wanted to warm it up. He comforted her, “Don’t be anxious. As the saying goes, no news is good news. The Wang Village Tunnel is so long. Perhaps the two of them are trapped in the middle of it. We have to hurry over and help rescue them.”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she looked at him with teary eyes and tried hard to pull herself together. “Okay.”

Gu Zhou looked at Chen Qing and said, “Prepare a car to go to the Wang Village Tunnel now. At the same time, contact more people and get them to save everyone.”

Chen Qing nodded. “Yes.” Holding his phone, he walked out.

After Chen Qing left, Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian and said softly, “I’m not sure what’s going on in the Wang Village Tunnel now. I don’t know if someone did it on purpose, or if the tunnel collapsed after years of disrepair. We will save everyone. That way, it’s most likely to ensure the safety of Mr. Qin and Lu Qi.”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, her eyes gradually hardened. She said softly, “Okay.”

Seeing that Qiao Nian had pulled herself together, Gu Zhou smiled slightly and helped her out.

Qiao Nian’s hands and feet were cold, and her legs were trembling. Even so, she still walked out firmly.

About an hour later, Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian had already arrived outside the Wang Village tunnel.

Snow was still falling from the sky. In the distance, it was all white. Only the Wang Village tunnel was in a mess.

The leaves had all fallen in winter, leaving only lonely tree trunks and branches. The grass and trees were yellow. As far as the eye could see, it was a desolate scene. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Qiao Nian’s body trembled involuntarily, and her heart began to race. She looked at everything in the distance with teary eyes.
