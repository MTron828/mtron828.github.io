1386 Guilt

Song Yu comforted Lu Qi in a low voice before saying to Qiao Nian, “Sister, it’s been hard on you here. I’ll go over and accompany you later.”

Qiao Nian smiled and shook her head. “It’s fine. Go ahead.”

Only then did Song Yu walk to Lu Zhu’s side and call out obediently, “Brother.”

After those people left, Lu Zhu waited until only he, Lu Nian, and Song Yu were left in the corridor before saying, “Did you see the person who called clearly?”

Song Yu shook her head. She had made this up to begin with. She did not expect Lu Zhu to take it seriously. “It was evening. That person was facing the light. I…”

Song Yu pursed her lips tightly and said guiltily, “Brother, I was too useless. If my feet hadn’t gone numb back then, I could have chased after the person to take a look.”

“It has nothing to do with you.” The doubts in Lu Zhu’s heart were resolved. He said with a serious expression, “There’s a traitor in the family. You have to be careful. It’s only because that traitor told others about Lu Qi’s schedule that something happened to her.”

“Brother.” Song Yu’s expression changed drastically. Her lips trembled as she asked anxiously, “Then what should we do now? How can we catch that person? That person wouldn’t randomly appear for us to catch, right?”

“Don’t go home for the time being. Pretend that you don’t know anything. When the time comes, I’ll send someone to protect you. Be careful when you’re outside. Don’t get injured,” Lu Zhu instructed in a low voice. He didn’t want anything to happen to Song Yu.

“How can I help?” Song Yu frowned slightly and said worriedly, “I’m also a member of the Lu family. I want to help too.”

Lu Zhu smiled at Song Yu and said gently, “I know, that’s why I want you to protect yourself. As long as you take good care of yourself, you’ll be helping.”

Lu Zhu paused again and said, “I don’t want you to be injured too. You were being watched previously. Why didn’t you say so?”

Song Yu pursed her lips slightly and said obediently, “I’m a public figure, and I’ve been with the production team recently. There are many people around me. I think I’m quite safe.”

“If you encounter such a thing in the future, tell me as soon as possible. Don’t hide it alone and think of resolving it yourself,” Lu Zhu said worriedly.

Song Yu nodded. “Then, then I’ll accompany Lu Qi later. I’ll return to the production team to film tomorrow.”

“Yup.”

Song Yu hurriedly jogged towards the ward area. From afar, she saw Qiao Nian, Lu Qi, and the others.

Lu Zhu and Lu Nian walked out. Lu Zhu looked at Lu Nian and asked in a low voice, “What do you think of this?”

“Send someone to keep an eye on Song Yu. They might even discover something else.” Lu Nian frowned and said with a complicated expression, “Perhaps she inadvertently knows something else, and those people are worried that she will tell us, so they’ve been following her.”

“Yes,” Lu Zhu replied. He and Lu Nian walked out of the emergency department and saw Gu Zhou standing there coldly.

Seeing Lu Zhu and Lu Nian come out, Gu Zhou’s gaze darkened slightly. “I’ll go with you.”

“Aren’t you going to accompany Sugar?” Lu Zhu asked.

“Her safety is more important.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Lu Zhu nodded. “Okay.”

…

Half an hour later, at the Lu family villa.

Lu Zhu and the others had just walked into the living room when they saw Matriarch Lu sitting on the sofa with red eyes.

Lu Zhu and Lu Nian greeted, “Grandma.”

Gu Zhou greeted politely, “Grandma Lu.”

“Hey, hey, hey. You must have returned from the hospital. How’s Qi Qi’s senior now?” Matriarch Lu hurriedly stood up and asked worriedly.

Previously, she had already seen news in the family group chat that Lu Qi was safe and sound. Now, she was worried about Qin Chuan, who was with Qi Qi.

Lu Zhu helped Matriarch Lu sit on the sofa and comforted her. “Grandma, don’t worry. We only returned after his surgery. The doctor said that he’s already out of danger. He just needs to recuperate well.”

When Matriarch Lu heard Lu Zhu’s words, she pressed her palms together and muttered piously, “God bless us. Both children are fine!”
