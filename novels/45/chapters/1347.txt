1348 You are pregnant?

Qiao Nian could tell from Matriarch Gu’s words that Matriarch Gu knew a portion of what Gu Zhou had done in MY. It seemed that she didn’t know that Gu Zhou was really injured.

Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief, but she didn’t show it on her face. She smiled at Matriarch Gu and said gently, “Grandma, he didn’t bully me.”

“Really?” Matriarch Gu looked at Qiao Nian suspiciously. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

When Nian Nian first married into the Gu family, Gu Zhou never treated her well. He was unwilling to speak to her.

It took a long time for the two of them to hold hands. She didn’t know if Ah Zhou had really understood or if he was putting on an act in front of her.

She was now worried that Qiao Nian wasn’t doing well. Qiao Nian had worried too much about this family. She hoped that Qiao Nian could live a happy life.

Hearing Matriarch Gu’s considerate words, Qiao Nian smiled and leaned her head on Matriarch Gu’s shoulder. She said softly, “Grandma, we really didn’t quarrel. Let me tell you a good thing.”

Matriarch Gu’s eyes lit up. She looked at Qiao Nian with a burning gaze. “Could it be that you’re pregnant?”

As she spoke, Matriarch Gu subconsciously glanced at Qiao Nian’s stomach.

At first, Qiao Nian didn’t understand what Matriarch Gu meant, but when Matriarch Gu looked at her stomach, she finally reacted. Blushing, she stood up straight and hurriedly explained, “Grandma, I’m not talking about this.”

“Then what is it?” Matriarch Gu looked at Qiao Nian in confusion. In her opinion, Qiao Nian’s pregnancy was the most important thing.

Qiao Nian glanced around. There was no one else around. She heaved a sigh of relief and said softly to Matriarch Gu, “Grandma, we’ve found Big Brother.”

Matriarch Gu looked at Qiao Nian in confusion and asked, “Ah Zhu went too?”

Qiao Nian shook her head and said in a low voice, “It’s Big Brother Gu Yue.”

“What?” When Matriarch Gu heard the name, her body trembled involuntarily. Her pupils dilated uncontrollably as she looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief.

“Grandma, don’t be too emotional.” Seeing Matriarch Gu’s face turn pale and her breathing quicken, Qiao Nian hurriedly helped Matriarch Gu breathe normally. “Listen to me. Breathe. Yes, breathe. Like this. Breathe, breathe…”

Matriarch Gu took a long time to recover. Her eyes were red, and tears welled up in her eyes. Her voice trembled as she asked, “Did you really see Ah Yue?”

Qiao Nian nodded and said solemnly, “Brother has very important things to do there. Previously, he pretended to have disappeared because he wanted to hide his identity. The people there have been keeping an eye on him, so he couldn’t go home for so many years.”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, tears streamed down Matriarch Gu’s face. She said happily, “Alright, alright. As long as he’s still alive, that’s good enough. It doesn’t matter if he goes home or not.”

“Grandma.” Qiao Nian helped Matriarch Gu sit on a seat in the pavilion. In a low voice, she instructed, “Grandma, you can’t tell anyone about this. If others find out that Big Brother is still alive, he might be in danger, so no one can know about this!”

Matriarch Gu grabbed Qiao Nian’s arm excitedly and said in a trembling voice, “I know. He’s hiding his identity outside now. If others find out his identity, it’ll be bad for him.”

“Grandma, there might be someone who is not trustworthy around us, so don’t tell anyone. You should pretend that Big Brother has gone missing. Just worry about him every day,” Qiao Nian instructed Matriarch Gu gently. With her other hand, she took out a tissue and gently wiped the tears from Matriarch Gu’s eyes.

“Yes, Nian Nian, you’re right. Ah Yue doesn’t dare to go home. He must be afraid that those bad people will find out his identity.” Matriarch Gu held Qiao Nian’s hand, tears welling up in her eyes. She said softly, “Nian Nian, you’re really the lucky star of our family. If it weren’t for you, Ah Zhou wouldn’t have gotten better and better. If it weren’t for you, we wouldn’t have known that you and Ah Zhou had a total of three children. If it weren’t for you, Ah Zhou and I wouldn’t have known that Ah Yue was still alive. Nian Nian, you’re really the lucky star of our Gu family. You’ve brought luck to our Gu family.”
