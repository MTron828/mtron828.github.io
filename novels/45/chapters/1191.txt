1192 That won’t do either!

There was more and more water in the bathtub. It was steaming hot, and she couldn’t breathe.

Thank you readers!

Gu Zhou approached Qiao Nian and stared unblinkingly into her eyes. There was a trace of dissatisfaction in his voice. “When Jiang Chi spoke to you, you looked at him.”

Qiao Nian pursed her lips. Faced with Gu Zhou’s paranoia, she said helplessly, “We’re partners with him now. When people speak, we should look into their eyes. Otherwise, others will say that I’m rude.”

“That won’t do either!”

Gu Zhou’s slightly parted lips caressed Qiao Nian’s. He lowered his voice, his tone becoming more and more dangerous.

Before Qiao Nian could speak, she noticed that Gu Zhou’s eyes were becoming more and more fanatical and possessive.

She wanted to retreat, but Gu Zhou was too close. She could not retreat at all. She could only look straight into Gu Zhou’s eyes.

“His eyes are different.” Gu Zhou frowned, his tone displeased. “I heard that many girls like those blue eyes.”

Qiao Nian didn’t reply.

“Nian’er.” Gu Zhou’s gaze was burning, as if he wanted to fuse with Qiao Nian’s body. “Do you think my eyes are better-looking than his?”

“Yes,” Qiao Nian replied without hesitation. Gu Zhou’s question was like a jealous girlfriend questioning her boyfriend, but their identities seemed to have been reversed. “Your eyes are the best-looking I’ve ever seen.”

If she had answered a second later, Gu Zhou’s jealous lover personality would definitely have flipped out even more.

“Really?”

Qiao Nian looked straight into Gu Zhou’s eyes. She could see her flushed face in his eyes and pursed her lips slightly.

She raised her long arm and wrapped it around Gu Zhou’s neck. Qiao Nian smiled and said infatuatedly, “I like your eyes the most. Every time you look at me, your eyes are like stars shining in the night sky. I can’t take my eyes off you at all.”

Qiao Nian paused for a moment before continuing. “Your eyes look the most special to me. No one’s eyes look better than yours.”

Gu Zhou’s breathing stopped.

This was the first time Qiao Nian had praised him so bluntly. Blood rose to his head and the aggression in her eyes intensified. “Then you can only look at me in the future.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Yes.” As Qiao Nian spoke, she moved closer to Gu Zhou’s lips and kissed him lightly. She nibbled on his lips and said ambiguously, “I’ll only look at you.”

Qiao Nian’s words were like a fuse, blowing up Gu Zhou’s rationality. The flames in his eyes burned brighter and brighter, and he kissed Qiao Nian’s lips.

Gu Zhou was very energetic. Besides the bathroom, he also left traces of their fierce battle on the sofa, balcony, and bed.

Exhausted, Qiao Nian lay on the bed. She was like a small boat swimming in the turbulent sea.

Gu Zhou lay down beside Qiao Nian and moved closer to her forehead. He kissed her lightly and called out in satisfaction, “Nian’er.”

Qiao Nian was still in a daze. When she heard Gu Zhou’s words, she replied casually, “Yes?”

“Even in your next life, you can only marry me!”

“Oh…”

After Gu Zhou finished speaking, he felt that two lifetimes were not enough. He asked, “Then what do you think about this in your next life?”

However, the only answer he received was Qiao Nian’s long and even breathing.

Gu Zhou didn’t get an answer from Qiao Nian. He looked down at her and saw that she was already sound asleep. He lowered his head slightly and was about to kiss her forehead when an unfamiliar scene suddenly appeared in front of him.

The two of them lay on the grass. Qiao Nian leaned into his arms like this, and he was about to kiss her.

Strange!

What was going on?

Gu Zhou frowned.

That scene seemed to have happened in his previous life.

In the past, Gu Zhou had never believed in past or present lives. He was an atheist.

But now, he couldn’t help but believe it.

In their previous lives, they must have been a very loving couple.

Otherwise, when he was with Qiao Nian, why would a certain action give him a sense of déjà vu?
