Chapter 566: Situation

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Gu Qi’s grip on her hand was so strong that Qiao Nian couldn’t pull her hand away for a moment. Just as she was about to exert more strength, she felt Gu Qi’s small hand move.

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She saw Gu Qi’s eyelashes trembling. Then, he opened his eyes.

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She saw Gu Qi’s eyelashes trembling. Then, he opened his eyes.

Strange.

He remembered that Mommy was by his side.

How did she become an aunt?

What happened to Mommy?

Seeing that Gu Qi had woken up, Qiao Nian thought that she might have pulled her hand away a little too forcefully just now and disturbed him. She said uncomfortably, “You… you’re awake. How do you feel now? Are you feeling unwell?”

Gu Qi met Qiao Nian’s worried eyes and said softly, “Auntie, I’m fine.”

Gu Qi’s voice was a little hoarse, and his throat still hurt. After he finished speaking, he couldn’t help but cough twice.

“Do you want some water?”

Gu Qi nodded, suppressing the doubts in his heart. He gradually let go of Qiao Nian’s hand.

Qiao Nian’s heart sank. For some reason, she felt a little uncomfortable. In the end, she turned around and poured Gu Qi a glass of water. She helped Gu Qi sit up and carefully fed him some water.

Gu Qi took two sips and shook his head.

Qiao Nian knew in her heart that children who had just recovered from their illnesses didn’t like to eat or drink. She didn’t say anything. She placed the cup on the bedside table and helped Gu Qi back on the bed.

She covered Gu Qi with the blanket. She had wanted to sneak out, but she felt embarrassed now. After some thought, she coaxed, “Do you want to sleep a little longer?”

When Gu Qi heard Qiao Nian’s words, he didn’t answer immediately. Instead, he narrowed his eyes and looked at Qiao Nian. After thinking for a long time, he still couldn’t figure it out. He kept frowning.

Qiao Nian thought that her words had made Gu Qi unhappy. She comforted him gently. “You’re still sick. You should rest more. If there’s anything, just tell Auntie. Be good!”

Gu Qi didn’t speak. He recalled how he had felt holding Qiao Nian’s hand.

Her hands were actually very similar to Mommy’s hands?

He must have lost his mind. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have such a strange thought.

“Then you must be hungry. I’ll get the kitchen to bring you some porridge.” Qiao Nian smiled at Gu Qi and stood up to walk towards the door. She said to the servant who had been guarding the door, “Go to the kitchen and bring some porridge for Little Master Qi. Also, tell Second Young Master that Little Qi has woken up.”

When the servant heard this, she hurriedly nodded in agreement.

Qiao Nian walked back into the room. She looked at Gu Qi, who was still frowning and looking serious. He looked like a mini-version of a domineering and cold CEO.

“What are you thinking about?” Qiao Nian sat by Gu Qi’s bed and asked with a smile. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Gu Qi shook his head.

Qiao Nian thought that Gu Qi had missed Gu Zhou. After all, as his godfather, Gu Zhou had taken good care of her. When Gu Zhou arrived later, Gu Qi might speak more and feel more at ease. After all, she was an outsider.

Qiao Nian smiled at Gu Qi. She wasn’t angry at his silence. Seeing that Gu Qi’s hair was in a mess, she reached out to tidy his hair and said softly, “Our Little Qi is so good-looking!”

With that, Qiao Nian was momentarily dazed.

For some reason, she looked at Little Qi as if she was looking at her when she was young.

The only difference was that Gu Qi had sword-like eyebrows, while she had willow-like eyebrows. However, their eyes were exactly the same.

Gu Qi’s eyes and nose were exactly the same as when she was young.

When she was young, her nose bridge was not high. Only when she grew up did it become high.

On the whole, they looked 50 to 60% alike. No wonder she had always felt that Gu Qi was close to her. It was hard not to have a good impression of someone who looked a lot like her.
