Chapter 401: Angry

Gu Zhou’s body stiffened. At the thought of Gu Qi wearing women’s clothes, his heart ached, and his breathing involuntarily became heavier.

No wonder Gu Qi always wore female clothes at home. It was actually because of this?

Gu Zhou’s body relaxed. He pretended to be calm and asked, “How did you know?”

“He told me himself.”

Gu Zhou felt a little uncomfortable. Gu Qi had been unwilling to speak to anyone at home, yet he had said so much to Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian continued to massage Gu Zhou. Curious, she asked, “What’s the name of your heartless friend?”

Gu Zhou was speechless.

Qiao Nian’s heart really ached for Gu Qi. She wanted to find a chance to teach his father a lesson.

Gu Zhou’s gaze landed on the mirror on the dressing table in front of him. From the mirror, he could see Qiao Nian gritting her teeth in anger.

Gu Zhou paused for a moment before continuing, “He seems to have the same surname as me!”

Qiao Nian frowned. What was the difference between this answer and not answering?

Could it be that Gu Zhou did not want to answer?

Qiao Nian couldn’t be bothered to massage Gu Zhou’s shoulders anymore. She retracted her hand and said calmly, “It’s about time!”

Gu Zhou rotated his shoulders slightly. Indeed, his shoulders were much better than before. After some thought, he turned to look at Qiao Nian, who was walking towards the closet. “Could there be a misunderstanding between the father and son?”

Qiao Nian was about to wash up when she heard Gu Zhou’s words. Her beautiful foxy eyes narrowed slightly as she stared at him unhappily. “Are you looking for an excuse for your heartless friend?”

Gu Zhou was speechless.

“You men always have an excuse. It’s clearly your fault!” Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou unhappily, her tone unfriendly. “I don’t want to talk to you!”

With that, Qiao Nian took her bathrobe and walked towards the bathroom. The more she thought about it, the angrier she became. She slammed the bathroom door shut, expressing her dissatisfaction.

Gu Zhou sat by the bed and looked at the bathroom door quietly.

This was the first time he had seen Qiao Nian so irrational. She seemed to care a lot about Gu Qi when she lost her temper in front of him.

After taking a shower, Qiao Nian crawled into bed, her back facing Gu Zhou. She didn’t want to see this bastard at all.

The next day.

When Qiao Nian woke up, there was no one beside her.

She remembered that she had lost her temper at Gu Zhou last night. What puzzled her was that Gu Zhou was not angry.

In her daze, she seemed to have seen Gu Zhou covering her with a blanket in the middle of the night.

This was really strange!

Could it be that Gu Zhou was a masochist?

How was that possible?

Forget it, let’s not think too much!

After washing up, Qiao Nian walked downstairs. In the living room, she saw Old Madam Gu sitting on the sofa in a daze.

Qiao Nian felt that Old Madam Gu seemed to have aged instantly.

Qiao Nian knew very well that although Old Madam Gu had chased Jiang Yue away and was unwilling to see her again, she still couldn’t help but miss her.

Qiao Nian gathered her thoughts and walked towards Old Madam Gu. She greeted her with a smile, “Good morning, Grandma!”

When Old Madam Gu heard Qiao Nian’s voice, she suddenly came back to her senses. With a smile, she held Qiao Nian’s hand and sat down beside her. She said warmly, “Good morning, Nian Nian!”

“Good child, did you sleep well last night?” Old Madam Gu looked at Qiao Nian gently.

“Yes, quite.”

Qiao Nian clearly remembered that she had dreamed of the dead child again last night.

If that child wasn’t dead, he would probably be about the same age as Gu Qi!

She dreamed of her child at night because she talked about Gu Qi before she went to bed…

Old Madam Gu nodded slightly. She looked at Qiao Nian guiltily and said, “Nian Nian, it’s all Grandma’s fault for what happened to Jiang Yue. I didn’t educate her well and let her do such a thing. If I had taught her well back then, she might not have gone down the wrong path and caused you to be in danger. I apologize to you now!”
