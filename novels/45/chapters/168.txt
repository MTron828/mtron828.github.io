Chapter 169 Seeing Through People

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in astonishment. She had never expected Gu Zhou to voice aloud exactly what she had been thinking.

At this moment, Jiang Yue was also stunned. She looked toward Gu Zhou tearfully, disbelief written all over her face. “Brother Ah Zhou…”

Only at this moment did Jiang Yue remember that Gu Zhou had witnessed all of her humiliation just now. However, he hadn’t stepped forward to help her out of her predicament. Not only that, but when she had tried to regain what was left of her dignity, he had deliberately spoken up to suppress her efforts.

Jiang Yue’s heart turned completely cold.

“Brother Ah Zhou, I know I’m in the wrong. I really do.” Jiang Yue looked at Gu Zhou with red-rimmed eyes, her voice choked with emotion. “I really didn’t know that this gown was meant for Sister Nian Nian. I will find a way to fix it…”

Towards the end, Jiang Yue was already sobbing.

“What’s the point of fixing something that’s already broken?” Gu Zhou retorted, his words still dripping with sarcasm.

Jiang Yue was now sobbing uncontrollably.

Qiao Nian was beginning to see Gu Zhou in a new light. She looked at him as if she were looking at an interesting novelty. Could Gu Zhou be reading her mind? Otherwise, why would he be able to say everything she wanted to say?

Gu Zhou retracted his gaze from Jiang Yue’s face, the disdain in his eyes obvious. He walked up to Matriarch Gu, lowering his gaze, and said gently, “Grandma, you must be tired. Let’s go home now!”

Jiang Yue looked at Gu Zhou anxiously. Still sobbing, she spoke, “Brother Ah Zhou, Sister Nian Nian…”

Matriarch Gu was already getting impatient. When she heard Jiang Yue continuing to speak, she frowned and said coldly, “Jiang Yue, I can tell that you know your mistake. Because of that, you’re a good child, and you know how to reflect upon your actions. However, it’s Nian Nian’s choice whether to forgive you or not. You shouldn’t have apologized in front of everyone, much less forced Nian Nian to be the bigger person and forgive you. If you’re really sincere, you should apologize to her in private. Alright, we’ll talk after we get back!”

Qiao Nian was not at all surprised by Matriarch Gu’s words.

Although Matriarch Gu doted on Jiang Yue a lot, she did not unconditionally indulge Jiang Yue.

No wonder Gu Zhou was so good at seeing through people. So he had taken after Matriarch Gu!

Jiang Yue had never expected Matriarch Gu to directly expose her thoughts. In her purple gown, she looked like an abandoned angel.

Liu Yu stood at the side and watched as Matriarch Gu, Gu Zhou, and Qiao Nian left. Suddenly, an idea struck her. She opened her mouth and got ready to expose everything her uncle had found out about Qiao Nian.

However, when she thought about how Jiang Yue was now at a disadvantage, she realized that no one would be on their side, even if she exposed the dirt she had on Qiao Nian. She could only wait until the next time to take revenge on Qiao Nian with Jiang Yue’s help.

As she thought about this, Liu Yu’s lips curved up involuntarily.

Suddenly, Liu Yu saw Qiao Nian turn back to look at her. The smile on her face froze.

Qiao Nian narrowed her fox-like eyes, staring unblinkingly at Liu Yu, her expression cold.

Liu Yu was frightened by Qiao Nian’s gaze. She hurriedly looked away and lowered her eyes guiltily. Her breathing quickened involuntarily.

Strange. Why was Qiao Nian looking at her?

Did Qiao Nian know that she had dirt on her?

This was impossible!

Her uncle was a top hacker. If he wanted to investigate someone, he would leave no trace.

Liu Yu’s mind was in a mess.

Qiao Nian retracted her gaze indifferently. Her gaze fell on Jiang Yue’s pale face. She raised her eyebrow and asked, “Are you very close to Liu Yu?” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

When Jiang Yue heard Qiao Nian’s question, she was slightly stunned. She didn’t understand why Qiao Nian would mention Liu Yu. She said casually, “She’s my classmate.”

“Is that so?” Qiao Nian looked at Jiang Yue intently, as if she didn’t believe Jiang Yue’s words. Speaking slowly, she said, “Help me tell her that her uncle should behave himself. He shouldn’t be investigating the private affairs of other people. Even if he does, he shouldn’t be giving himself away. Otherwise, I’m afraid that he won’t even be aware of whose wrath he’s facing before he’s killed.”
