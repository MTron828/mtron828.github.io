Chapter 323: Earning Big Bucks

“Nian Nian, let me tell you. Mr. Q made an exception today and said that he wanted to bring someone up the ranks. I’m really too excited. If he brings someone up the ranks, I’ll be able to become a king very soon!”

A trace of surprise flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes. “He’s going to bring someone with him?”

“Yes, he even said that the highest bidder would get it. He said that he was short of money,” Wang Xuan said honestly.

Qiao Nian was momentarily speechless.

He was the first in the national server. However, he was willing to bring someone up the ranks because he lacked money

This… Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

This was simply unbelievable!

Wang Xuan said excitedly, “I thought that I was already very lucky to be able to come here to listen to Mr. Dong Hua’s performance, but I never expected that I would be able to see Mr. Q teaming up with someone. He’s my dream idol, and I wonder when I’ll be able to hear his voice. Ahhh, I’m going to make a bid!”

Qiao Nian hadn’t wanted to play games, but when she heard Wang Xuan’s words, her hands began to itch.

Wang Xuan looked at the notifications in the game and frowned. She said regretfully, “This bid is increasing too quickly. Forget it, I’ll give up!”

Qiao Nian recalled that when she was playing games in the past, she had once been on Mr. Q’s team. However there was a troll in the team that scolded her, and Mr. Q had spoken up for her.

After Mr. Q spoke, the troll dared not speak again.

Back then, after the game, she had wanted to add Mr. Q as a friend, but he had refused.

She seemed to owe Mr. Q a thank-you.

Qiao Nian turned to look at Wang Xuan and asked curiously, “Is he short of money?”

“He didn’t say how much he owed, but from his tone, it seems to be a huge sum!”

Qiao Nian said thoughtfully, “Looks like it’s quite a lot.”

“I thought so too. Otherwise, why would Mr. Q make an exception and bring someone up the ranks!”

Qiao Nian asked, “What’s the bid now?”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s question, Wang Xuan really wanted to cry. She said pitifully, “There’s a hooligan in the game. He offered a million dollars. He wants Mr. Q to play with him for a day!”

Qiao Nian thought for a while and said unhurriedly, “Go to the hall and post an article. Tell them you’ll bid for a million dollars per round, until Mr. Q is no longer willing to play.”

Wang Xuan looked at Qiao Nian in shock.

Qiao Nian met Wang Xuan’s surprised eyes and said, “Why are you looking at me? I’m not your idol. Send it!”

Wang Xuan’s hands were trembling a little. She sent the message, and her heart began to race.

[Damn, she’s a rich lady!]

[I want to be first in the national server too. Rich lady, look at me!]

[I’m so envious…]

[If I’m first in the national server, I’ll definitely fight until the sky goes dark!]

[She’s so rich!]

[The rich lady used money to deal with a hooligan!]

…

Wang Xuan looked up at Qiao Nian and stammered, “Don’t tell me you want to play a game with Mr. Q!”

“Of course.”

“But you’ll be performing on stage in more than two hours. Don’t you need to practice a little more?”

“Gaming can also improve one’s hand speed!”

Wang Xuan was speechless.

Fine!

The thoughts of a genius were not something an ordinary person like her could fathom.

Wang Xuan glanced at her phone and her gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. She said, “The hooligan has already raised the bid to two million per round. Do you still want to raise?”

Qiao Nian looked at herself in the mirror and said lightly, “Ten million?”

Wang Xuan looked shocked.

Crazy, crazy. The entire world had gone crazy!

Poverty had really limited her imagination.

Trembling, Wang Xuan typed out a row of words.

“Ten million per round!”

For the first time, Wang Xuan felt that she was being arrogant.

At this moment, the hooligan began to curse.

“You green tea b*tch. Do you think your bragging can attract the attention of a big shot? Do you think I won’t kill you later?”
