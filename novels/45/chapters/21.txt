Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

With Qiao Nian’s abilities, she could leave the mental hospital any time she wanted. The reason why she married into the Gu family was because she did not want to be monitored by the Qiao family after leaving the mental hospital.

No matter how long her marriage with Gu Zhou would last, it would not affect her investigation of what happened five years ago.

Now, she could make use of Gu Zhou to investigate what happened five years ago.

Matriarch Gu repeatedly urged Qiao Nian to buy more clothes. After talking for a while, she grew worried that Qiao Nian would be embarrassed to use the black card to spend money on new clothes. She hurriedly looked toward her and said, “My darling girl, why don’t I go shopping with you? I’m afraid you won’t be willing to spend money.”

Qiao Nian smiled and quickly said, “Grandma, I can do it myself.”

“Alright. But if you don’t go shopping today, I’ll be going with you tomorrow.” Matriarch Gu stood up as she spoke, her gaze landing on Qiao Nian’s face. “I have something on today, so I’ll leave first. Remember, you must buy more clothes. Women should treat themselves better!”

“Okay.” Qiao Nian agreed obediently.

Seeing Qiao Nian like this, Matriarch Gu was overjoyed.

After seeing Matriarch Gu off, Qiao Nian looked at the black card in her hand. She thought for a while and decided to follow Matriarch Gu’s instructions to buy some new clothes. She didn’t have many clothes after leaving the mental hospital.

When she reached the mall, Qiao Nian walked into a branded shop and looked though the clothes calmly.

Qiao Xin and her friend Zhou Xue were also shopping at the same mall. Zhou Xue wasn’t very well-off, and usually went out with Qiao Xin. Qiao Xin would gift her some clothes when she was in a good mood.

Zhou Xue’s gaze landed on the person not far away from them. She frowned slightly and whispered, “Xin Xin, look. Is that person your older sister?”

Without waiting for Qiao Xin to reply, Zhou Xue continued in confusion, “Didn’t you say that your sister was in the mental hospital? Why has she come out?”

Qiao Xin was looking through some clothes when she heard Zhou Xue’s words. She looked over and saw Qiao Nian doing the same not far away. She rolled her eyes and said in a low voice, “Sister came out a few days ago. She’s already gotten married.”

Hearing Qiao Xin’s words, Zhou Xue looked at Qiao Xin in disbelief and asked in a low voice, “Your family must be so nice. They gave your sister such a large dowry for her marriage!”

At that, Qiao Xin was momentarily stunned. She thought of the shares Qiao Nian had extorted from her, and silently agreed with Zhou Xue.

Zhou Xue’s gaze fell on the sales assistant behind Qiao Nian. The sales assistant was already holding seven to eight pieces of clothing. One had to know that the cheapest item here cost around ten thousand dollars.

Qiao Xin naturally noticed the clothes Qiao Nian had selected. Rolling her eyes, she continued, “Sister took half of my company shares!”

“What!” Zhou Xue looked at Qiao Xin in shock. Qiao Xin owned 20% of the Qiao company shares. According to Qiao Xin, Qiao Nian had taken half of her shares, which meant… “Your parents gave those to her willingly?”

Qiao Xin lowered her head dejectedly, her eyes watery as she said, “She’s my older sister. I should give in to her!”

With those few casual words, Qiao Xin aired out all her grievances. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“This won’t do. We have to get your shares back. Back then, she tried to snatch your boyfriend; now, she’s stolen your money. You can’t give in to her so easily!” Pulling Qiao Xin with her, Zhou Xue began to walk towards Qiao Nian in a rage. She had to seek justice for her good friend.

Qiao Nian was standing in front of the mirror, holding a floral dress and examining it carefully. After looking at it for a while, she shook her head in dissatisfaction and put the dress back onto the rack. She was about to look for other clothes when she saw Zhou Xue and Qiao Xin walking towards her.

“Qiao Nian, you’re so shameless!” Zhou Xue’s fury exploded when she saw Qiao Nian. She had never seen such a brazen woman in her life. “In the past, you tried to snatch Qiao Xin’s boyfriend and now you’ve even stolen her shares. How can you be so vicious!”

Qiao Nian was no longer in the mood to shop. She couldn’t be bothered to talk to someone who clearly lacked intelligence. She turned to the sales assistant and said, “Help me wrap these things up.”

“Yes, ma’am,” the sales assistant answered. Holding the items, she walked towards the cashier.

Qiao Nian stepped towards the cashier, preparing to pay, but Zhou Xue grabbed hold of her arm.

She turned around and saw Zhou Xue raising her hand, preparing to give her a slap. Without waiting for her to make a move, Qiao Nian swiftly slapped Zhou Xue, causing Zhou Xue to stagger two steps back.

In the space of that slap, Zhou Xue had no choice but to let go of Qiao Nian’s arm. In a panic, she held onto the shelf beside her, barely managing to keep her balance.

Qiao Xin glared at Qiao Nian with an ugly expression, then hurriedly lowered her gaze. She quickly walked to Zhou Xue’s side, holding out a hand to support her. Rolling her eyes, Qiao Xin said softly, “Xue’er, let’s go.. You won’t be able to beat her. I remember your boyfriend liked her back then, but she…”
