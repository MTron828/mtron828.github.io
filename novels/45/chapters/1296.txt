1297 It doesn’t hurt anymore!

Gu Zhou’s pupils dilated, and his heart skipped a beat.

In his impression, when the two of them were alone in bed, Qiao Nian was bullied so badly and he forced her to call him that.

At that time, Qiao Nian would always call him that obediently. Only then would he let her off.

Moreover, Qiao Nian usually called him “Gu Zhou” or “Ah Zhou”. This was the first time she had taken the initiative to call him “Hubby”.

This greeting was extremely gentle, as if it could soothe the pain in his body.

Just as Gu Zhou was about to speak, Qiao Nian shook her head gently and held his hand tightly. “Don’t say anything now. Save your strength. I’ll operate on you later. Don’t worry, it’ll be fine.”

Gu Zhou stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian, his pupils filled with her face.

Qiao Nian lowered her head slightly and kissed Gu Zhou’s forehead just like how Gu Zhou often kissed hers.

Gu Zhou’s eyes were filled with smiles. Looking at Qiao Nian, he really felt that his body no longer hurt. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Mr. Chen was reading documents in the study of the villa when his phone suddenly rang. He took the cell phone and looked at the caller ID. A trace of a smile flashed in his eyes.

It seemed that Gu Zhou should be fine.

If something had happened to Gu Zhou, that person would definitely have asked the people outside to rush in, not call him.

Chang Feng, who was standing at the side, followed Mr. Chen’s gaze. When he saw the caller ID, he heaved a sigh of relief, but his expression was calm. “Mr. Chen, my phone is ringing.”

Mr. Chen picked up the call and placed it to his ear. “Mr. Cui, it’s already so late. Why aren’t you resting?”

“Chen Quan, I just received news that in order to snatch your credit, that fool Kan Shan brought people to look for Gu Zhou!”

Cui Huai’s anxious voice came from the cell phone.

Mr. Chen flipped through the documents slowly, looking as if it had nothing to do with him. “Mr. Cui, don’t be angry. Anyone can do this mission. As long as it can complete your mission, I have no objections.”

Mr. Chen paused for a moment and continued, “However, this also means that Kan Shan is ambitious. He has been under me for so many years. It’s good for him to take another step forward. Congratulations, Mr. Cui, for adding another tiger general!”

Mr. Chen’s tone was as calm as ever. On the other end of the line, Cui Huai frowned. He looked at his cell phone in confusion. If Chen Quan wasn’t really a real person, he would have suspected that he was a robot. His words were calm.

Cui Huai gripped his cell phone tightly and said in frustration, “What tiger general? He’s clearly an idiot. He brought so many people with him, but he still failed. I’ve suffered a huge loss this time!”

Mr. Chen and Cui Huai were on the phone, so Chang Feng could hear them clearly. The two of them exchanged a look.

Chang Feng heaved a sigh of relief. He was far away, so his voice would not be heard on the cell phone.

Mr. Chen asked in surprise, “What? Failed?”

“Otherwise, why would I say that Kan Shan is an idiot? He can’t even handle such a small matter!”

Mr. Chen’s frown deepened. Pretending to be troubled, he said, “What a pity. Today was a good opportunity. If only we could catch them.”

“Yeah.”

“But Gu Zhou should be on guard. It’ll be difficult for us to attack again,” Mr. Chen said, pursing his lips.

There was silence on the other side of the cell phone. After a long while, Cui Huai’s stern voice came through.

“Gu Zhou must have come to MY to look for his child. Now that he’s found his child, I’m afraid he won’t come to MY again for the time being. We have to keep him in MY so that he can’t return to An City for the rest of his life. Otherwise, we won’t have such a good opportunity to attack him again!”

When Mr. Chen heard Cui Huai’s words, he frowned slightly and remained silent.

Cui Huai’s voice suddenly rose as he said loudly, “Now is the best time to assassinate Gu Zhou. Chen Quan, bring someone to kill him now. At all costs. As long as Gu Zhou dies, the Gu family will be gone!”
