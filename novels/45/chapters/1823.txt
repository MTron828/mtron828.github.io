Chapter 1824 - 1824 Making Peace

Chang Feng’s eyes were filled with smiles.

Xiao Bao went straight to Chang Feng’s face and kissed him. He smiled and said, “Xiao Bao loves Uncle Chang Feng too!”

Chang Feng’s pupils dilated uncontrollably, and his heart skipped a beat.

After so many years, his heart was already dead, but at this moment, it was awakened by Xiao Bao. Xiao Bao seemed to be a ray of sunlight that illuminated his dark world.

Seeing that Xiao Bao and Chang Feng had reconciled, Qiao Nian’s heart, which had been in her throat, finally relaxed. She walked to Lu Nian’s side and smiled at Gu Qi. Just now, Gu Qi had thought that Xiao Bao had been bullied. His first reaction was to go up and protect him.

“Our Xiao Qi is a responsible brother. He knows how to take care of his younger siblings.” Qiao Nian held Gu Qi’s hand and praised him.

Gu Qi’s eyes lit up as he nodded.

Qiao Nian’s gaze landed on Xiao Shi’s face. A trace of confusion flashed across her eyes as she asked, “Xiao Shi, what’s wrong with your eyes?”

The wind was a little strong at night. Could it be that there was sand in Xiao Shi’s eyes?

Xiao Shi raised his hand and rubbed his eyes. He looked at Chang Feng and Xiao Bao, who were not far away, and said with a low laugh, “After I saw Uncle Chang Feng and Second Brother, I had a strange feeling in my heart. I don’t know how to explain it.”

Lu Nian had always doted on Xiao Shi. He smiled at Qiao Nian and said, “I realized that Xiao Shi is very empathetic. This is not good for her.”

Qiao Nian understood what Lu Nian meant. She smiled and took Xiao Shi from Lu Nian. She said gently, “Actually, as long as she has the right values, it’s not a bad thing to have strong empathy.”

To Qiao Nian, as long as Xiao Shi could grow up in a healthy environment, she would not be hurt by her strong empathy.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

She only hoped that Xiao Shi could grow up healthily and she could have a healthy body and mind. She looked at Xiao Shi in front of her and asked gently, “Did you miss your Daddy and me when you were at home?”

Xiao Shi revealed a bright smile and nodded obediently. He continued, “My brothers and I miss Mommy and Daddy very much.”

Chang Feng, who was at the side, said something to Xiao Bao. Xiao Bao smiled until his eyes narrowed into a line, and his bell-like laughter was scattered with the wind.

At this moment, on the top floor of a small detached house not far from the Lu family villa, there was a room that was still lit. The white curtains swayed with the wind.

Every time Song Yu memorized her lines, she would memorize them alone to build up her feelings and try her best to get into character.

She was wearing a long white nightdress as she stood by the curtains.

The cold moonlight shone on her body. Her exquisite face had already lost its usual beauty. She was like a fairy who had fallen to the mortal world with a lot of spiritual energy.

Song Yu was so sleepy when she was reciting her lines just now that she fell asleep. Later, she was woken up by the three children calling out “Mommy”.

She thought that she was hallucinating. After all, she had just dreamed of her sister, so she walked to the balcony.

Her position was not far from the three children, and she could vaguely hear their voices.

She knew very well what had happened to her sister and the three little ones. She had even seen everything that had happened after Big Brother and Second Brother rushed over.

When Second Brother saw his sister, he called her “Sugar”. That was his sister’s nickname.

During this period of time, Second Brother had been thinking about Sister. If she was filming outside and went home, she wondered if Second Brother would call her by her nickname.

“How scheming.”

A cold voice suddenly sounded behind her.

When Song Yu heard that voice, she frowned slightly and turned to look at the person. Her expression darkened.

Song Yu’s gaze landed on Aunt Cao’s face. Her gaze landed on Aunt Cao’s face and her voice was cold. “Aunt Cao, why are you here?”

Aunt Cao was still holding the soup in her hand. She smiled at Song Yu in front of her and said gently, “I thought you must be exhausted from memorizing the script, so I wanted to make some nourishing soup for you.”
