1458 Ten Hours

Lina was about to say something but she was too tired. She couldn’t open her eyes or move her lips.

Seeing that Lina had fallen asleep, Qiao Nian covered her with the blanket and tiptoed out. When she went out, she took out her phone and hacked into the surveillance cameras in this ward.

Perhaps Wright would think of a way to take Lina away. She had to pay attention to Lina’s situation at all times.

Qiao Nian walked out of the ward and saw Dr. Ollie standing at the door, looking like he wanted to say something but hesitated.

She pursed her lips and said, “Dr. Ollie, give me ten hours first.”

Dr. Ollie didn’t answer immediately. He adjusted his glasses with his hand, his narrow eyes narrowing slightly.

Ten hours was really too long.

Putting everything else aside, the president might find out that something had happened to the Seventh Princess. If the president personally asked for her, what should he do? Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Dr. Ollie knew very well that from the moment the Seventh Princess arrived, he was on the same boat as Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian. He lowered his gaze and pondered for a moment. “What if the President comes?”

“We’ll handle these matters. Dr. Ollie, please don’t let anyone enter her ward,” Qiao Nian said with certainty.

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Ollie nodded slightly. If Qiao Nian didn’t get the antidote in ten hours, he would take the initiative to hand the Seventh Princess over to the president.

“Thank you!” Qiao Nian thanked him and walked towards the other side of the corridor.

Gu Zhou stood by the window at the end of the corridor. Against the light, his back made him look illusory.

When he heard footsteps, he turned around and saw Qiao Nian approaching. Without waiting for her to speak, he said, “I’ve already transferred her over. She’s at your disposal.”

Qiao Nian stopped in her tracks and looked up at Gu Zhou. She hadn’t even told Gu Zhou what she was going to do. Gu Zhou seemed to have already guessed it.

Qiao Nian’s lips curved up slightly, her eyes filled with laughter. “No matter what I do, you’ll support me?”

Gu Zhou met Qiao Nian’s bright eyes. He took a step forward and raised his hand to stroke Qiao Nian’s face. “How could I reject you in such a matter?”

Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat. Of course she knew that Gu Zhou would stand by her side, but she hadn’t expected him to not hesitate at all.

Qiao Nian’s lips curved up slightly, and her tense heart relaxed a little.

Gu Zhou took Qiao Nian’s hand and pulled her into his arms. He gently patted her back and lowered his head to say to her, “Do as you think. Leave the rest to me.”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, her heart warmed. She poked her head out of Gu Zhou’s arms and looked up at him, smiling. “Okay.”

Seeing that Qiao Nian was in a much better mood, Gu Zhou let go of her and said softly, “What do you plan to do next?”

As he spoke, Gu Zhou continued to hold Qiao Nian’s hand, his fingers gently caressing her palm.

Before Qiao Nian could answer, footsteps came from the safe passage not far away. She followed Gu Zhou’s gaze and turned around to see Chen Qing walking over.

“Second Young Master and Madam, the news of the Seventh Princess’s injury hasn’t spread. The European President doesn’t know about this,” Chen Qing reported solemnly.

Hearing Chen Qing’s words, Gu Zhou nodded slightly.

Qiao Nian narrowed her fox-like eyes. It seemed that Wright indeed had his own thoughts. Wright probably wanted to take Lina away from her, so Wright didn’t want to alarm the president now.

Qiao Nian pondered for a moment before asking, “Is there any movement from Wright?”

“I think their people are waiting outside the hospital.” As Chen Qing spoke, he frowned. “Madam, do you want me to…”

“Don’t make a move for the time being,” Qiao Nian said sternly. Then, after some thought, she continued, “Chen Qing, please go to Bear Mountain again and bring back the arrow that stabbed Lina.”

Chen Qing’s eyes were filled with confusion. Although he didn’t understand why Second Young Madam wanted him to do this, he still nodded. “Okay, I’ll go now!”
