1292 Scared

The dim yellow streetlights at the side flickered non-stop. Kan Shan was so frightened that his heart was in his throat. He had even forgotten to breathe.

Gu Zhou had easily dealt with more than twenty of them alone and even fooled them.

Not only that, but not only did Gu Zhou not kill them, but he also crippled their hands and legs.

This was the most terrifying thing.

During the battle, everyone fired desperately so that they could get the other party shot and kill him.

Not only had Gu Zhou shot each of them, but he had also avoided their vital points.

At this moment, Gu Zhou, who was like the Grim Reaper, stood in front of him.

Gu Zhou’s dark eyes narrowed slightly as he looked down at Kan Shan coldly. Seeing Kan Shan’s terrified expression, he slowly squatted down and played with the dagger in his hand.

Gu Zhou had interacted with Kan Shan a few times, but they were all unpleasant.

He raised Kan Shan’s chin with the dagger and forced him to look at him. He asked, “Did Cui Huai instruct you to chase after me?”

Kan Shan’s breathing quickened. He saw the cold dagger pressed against his chin. If Gu Zhou’s hand trembled, it might slit his neck. “I-I don’t know.”

“You don’t know?” As Gu Zhou spoke, the tip of the knife approached Kan Shan’s neck and he raised his eyebrows slightly. “Huh?”

Kan Shan was so frightened that tears welled up in his eyes. He closed his eyes. “I really don’t know!”

“You’re quite stubborn.” Gu Zhou retracted the dagger.

Kan Shan’s eyelashes trembled slightly. He couldn’t believe that Gu Zhou believed him. Just as he was about to heave a sigh of relief, he felt a bone-piercing pain on the back of his hand. “Ah!”

Kan Shan opened his eyes again and saw Gu Zhou stabbing his hand with a dagger.

To people like Kan Shan, their hands and feet were very important. They were hired thugs. If something happened to their hands and feet, what would they do in the future?

At this moment, Kan Shan thought that Gu Zhou would not kill him

Gu Zhou looked at the dagger and spun it around on the back of Kan Shan’s hand. He said nonchalantly, “We have plenty of time. Why don’t I pick out every tendon in your body? When the time comes, I’ll bring them to you. Help me count how many tendons I’ve cut into pieces!”

Kan Shan broke out in a cold sweat from the pain and screamed, “I don’t know, I really don’t know. Don’t torture me. If you don’t believe me, just kill me!”

“How boring would it be to kill you? The game tonight was not bad. We have to continue playing!” As Gu Zhou spoke, he casually took out the dagger from Kan Shan’s hand. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Blood spurted out. Seeing that his hand was almost crippled, Kan Shan’s tears fell.

After Chen Qing finished dealing with the others, he walked up to Kan Shan. Looking at the dying Kan Shan, he took out his gun and aimed it at him. He looked up at Gu Zhou and asked, “Second Young Master, should we kill him directly?”

When Kan Shan heard Chen Qing’s words, he was already prepared to die.

“It’s illegal to kill someone.” Gu Zhou pressed down the gun in Chen Qing’s hand and said calmly, “Send him to the hospital. Get someone to keep an eye on him. Don’t let him die. Just keep him alive.”

Kan Shan looked at Gu Zhou in fear. Gu Zhou wanted him to suffer a fate worse than death.

Gu Zhou met Kan Shan’s terrified eyes and smiled. “When the time comes, I’ll have to pick out his tendons bit by bit. Watch him closely. I can’t let him die!”

Before Kan Shan could catch his breath, he fainted!

Gu Zhou watched as everyone sent Kan Shan to the car. Just as he was about to get into the other car to go to the hospital, he sensed a gaze behind him. He turned around and saw Qiao Nian’s worried expression.

His thin lips curved up slightly.

Even if he was alone, he could protect Qiao Nian and Xiao Bao!

Fortunately, they were all still alive.

Qiao Nian walked up to Gu Zhou and sized him up carefully. When her gaze finally landed on Gu Zhou’s abdomen, her heart skipped a beat. Instinctively, she reached out to unbutton Gu Zhou’s shirt.

Gu Zhou grabbed Qiao Nian’s hand. He had pressed on the wound previously, and there was still a lot of blood.
