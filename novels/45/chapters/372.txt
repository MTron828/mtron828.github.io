Chapter 373: Apology

In the past, it had taken her about half a month to draw this painting. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Due to this, every detail of this painting was deeply engraved in her mind. Therefore, this time, she only took five hours to complete it in one go.

At this moment, Old Master Jiang Qi, who was standing at the side, was so excited that tears welled up in his eyes.

In his entire life, Old Master Jiang Qi had dominated the world of painting and calligraphy. However, he had never expected that he would be blind this time. He had mistaken a stone for a pearl. His integrity was truly ruined.

Moreover, he was questioning the person he admired the most, Miss Huang Shi.

At this moment, he was truly filled with regret!

Tears of remorse fell involuntarily.

“Miss Huang Shi…” Mr. Jiang Qi’s voice was choked with emotion as he staggered towards Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian turned to look at Mr. Jiang Qi. His eyes were covered in a layer of mist, and traces of time had covered his entire face.

Putting aside Old Master Jiang Qi’s status, it seemed that he was just an old man.

At this moment, Qiao Nian recalled her grandfather, who had raised her. She and Qin Chuan had searched for her grandfather for so many years, but there was still no news of him.

...

She wondered if her grandfather was still alive…

At the thought of her grandfather, Qiao Nian looked at Old Master Jiang Qi with a much gentler gaze. Just as she was about to speak, she saw Old Master Jiang Qi kneel down in front of her.

Qiao Nian took a step forward and hurriedly pulled Jiang Qi back up. Frowning, she asked, “What are you doing?”

“I’m guilty. I’ve let you down!” At this point, Old Master Jiang Qi’s face was filled with regret. “I actually mistook your authentic work for a fake. I…”

Towards the end, Old Master Jiang Qi was already sobbing uncontrollably.

Qiao Nian hurriedly helped Mr. Jiang Qi up and said, “Old Master, let’s talk slowly. Hurry up and get up. You’re embarrassing me!”

Old Master Jiang Qi shook his head, seemingly disagreeing with Qiao Nian. “I’m guilty…”

Qiao Nian spoke up to comfort him. “Sir, it’s very normal for you to admit your mistake. After all, there are two paintings, and everyone will have a preconceived notion. Subconsciously, everyone believes that Miss Song’s painting is authentic. This is human nature!”

Although Jiang Qi had just said sternly that her painting was a fake, and Qiao Nian was a little displeased, she could tell that Jiang Qi really liked Miss Huang Shi.

Even though Qiao Nian had comforted Jiang Qi, he still couldn’t get over it. Trembling, he said, “I’m very ashamed. I’ve really let you down!”

Qiao Nian smiled and shook her head. “Since the truth has been revealed, this means that the matter has already passed.”

Old Master Jiang Qi felt a little upset. He still blamed himself, but he knew in his heart that if he continued like this, it would not be good for his reputation. He looked at Qiao Nian gratefully and said, “Thank you for forgiving me.”

Qiao Nian smiled and shook her head. Her gaze fell on the stone wall painting she had just drawn. She looked up at Old Master Jiang Qi and asked, “Old Master, can this copied stone wall painting be placed in the display cabinet of your drawing room?”

Qiao Nian also knew that Jiang Qi had once collected two of her paintings.

When Qiao Nian said this, everyone present was stunned.

Old Master Jiang Qi looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief, almost thinking that he had misheard her.

Qiao Nian continued, “Although this is just a copied painting, and most copied paintings will be destroyed, but I know that you really like this painting. You can keep this painting, but I want to write the word ‘copy’ on it.”

Old Master Jiang Qi was stunned. When he came back to his senses, his hands began to tremble involuntarily. He asked in disbelief, “Are… are you giving me this painting?”
