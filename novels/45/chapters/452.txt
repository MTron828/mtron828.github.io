Chapter 453: Are You Serious?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Lu Rao!

This name was really nice!

The Lu couple was too good at giving birth. Their three sons were all so outstanding!

The eldest was an entrepreneur, the second was a performer, and the third was a boxing champion.

Chen Shi hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to be so shocked. Without thinking, he immediately called Third Young Master.

– I’m sorry, your phone you’re calling is switched off. Please try again later!

Chen Shi frowned. It seemed that Third Young Master had already taken a plane back to An City. He could not contact him now.

At this moment, Chen Shi felt a sense of helplessness. If not for Third Young Master, he would not have known where the Lu family’s power was, let alone how to save Eldest Young Master. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Qiao Nian quickly recovered from her shock. She took out her phone and made a call without hesitation.

“Hello?”

The man’s lazy voice came through the phone.

Qiao Nian’s expression was serious as she ordered, “Old Qin, I’m in MY now. I’ve encountered some troublesome matters. Send a few powerful bodyguards to me! Also, prepare some guns and explosives for me!”

There was a pause on the other end of the line, then a man’s surprised voice said, “What do you want these for?”

Qiao Nian recalled how Lu Zhu had looked after being shot. She couldn’t help but tighten her grip on her phone. “Of course I’ll blow up Jiang Chi’s lair! I’ll take revenge and eliminate the evil for the people!”

In the driver’s seat, Chen Shi was shocked. He stepped on the brakes in shock and looked at Qiao Nian in surprise.

She seemed to have really watched too many police dramas.

What did he mean by blowing up Jiang Chi’s lair?

You’re still talking about revenge and getting rid of evil for the people?

Could this matter be resolved so easily?

If Jiang Chi could be eliminated like this, why would he be called the Black Hell King?

On the other end of the line, Qin Chuan was also stunned for a few seconds. He stammered, “You… you’re serious?”

“I’m not in the mood to joke with you now. Cut the crap. I’ll send you an address now. Get them to come and find me!” Qiao Nian said anxiously.

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Qin Chuan was certain that she wasn’t joking. Hence, he said, “Okay!”

Chen Shi couldn’t help but steal a glance at Qiao Nian’s phone. On the screen was the name—Qin Chuan!

At this moment, Chen Shi looked as if he had been struck by lightning. He was charred on the outside and tender on the inside, and his brain had crashed.

After a long while, Chen Shi gradually regained his senses.

As he had expected, the man’s voice on the other end of the line sounded a little familiar. However, he had never expected that man to be Qin Chuan.

In MY, if Jiang Chi was the Black Hell King, then Qin Chuan was the White Jade Emperor.

The two of them were evenly matched.

In the past, they had minded their own business.

This was because if both sides attacked, it would only result in both sides suffering.

However, what puzzled Chen Shi was why a big shot like Qin Chuan would listen to Qiao Nian.

Thinking about it this way, Third Young Master had just been Qiao Nian’s bodyguard for a few hours. Now, it didn’t seem so embarrassing anymore.

After Qiao Nian hung up, she instructed Chen Shi, “Hurry up and follow them. If the signal breaks, we won’t be able to catch up!”

At first, Chen Shi had looked down on Qiao Nian. But now, without any hesitation, he nodded and said, “Okay!”

As long as he could save Eldest Young Master safely, so what if he was ordered around by a little girl like Qiao Nian?

If anything happened to Eldest Young Master, even if he committed suicide to apologize, he would still be blamed.

Without hesitation, Qiao Nian took out a box from her pocket. Inside the box was the Moon Goddess that the mercenaries wanted.

She had already promised her grandmother that she would bring the Moon Goddess back safely.

However, something had happened. In order to save her, Lu Zhu had been seriously injured and had been taken away by Jiang Chi’s men. She could only exchange the Moon Goddess for Lu Zhu because his life was more important!

At that time, after saving Lu Zhu and sending him to the hospital, she could think of a way to snatch the Moon Goddess back.
