762 Heartache

A trace of confusion flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes. Puzzled, she asked, “Xiao Qi, why haven’t I heard you mention Xiao Shi before?”

When Gu Qi heard Qiao Nian’s words, he frowned and explained seriously, “Actually, I only found out that we might be siblings when I first saw her.”

“Didn’t you live together in the past?” Qiao Nian asked in confusion, although she already had a vague guess.

Gu Qi shook his head gently and said, “She used to live in Hai Cheng. She came to An City to look for me today. Only then did the two of us realize that we looked very alike.”

Through Gu Qi’s words, Qiao Nian roughly understood what had happened. It seemed that Gu Zhou and Gu Qi didn’t know about the existence of Xiao Qi.

If she wasn’t wrong, she should be Gu Qi’s twin sister.

Although she looked exactly like Gu Qi, it couldn’t be ruled out that the two of them weren’t related by blood. With a scientific and rigorous mind, Qiao Nian felt that she should do a paternity test for Gu Qi and Xiao Shi. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Qiao Nian pulled Gu Qi to Xiao Shi and slowly squatted down. With a faint smile in her eyes, she asked gently, “Xiao Shi, how did you get here? Did you come with your family, or did you come here alone? Who else is in your family?”

Xiao Xiang stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian.

She was so gentle and beautiful. No wonder Daddy and Brother liked her so much.

If she stayed by Auntie Nian Nian’s side, she would like her too.

Xiao Shi tried hard to pretend to be calm and avoided the main point. “Auntie, I came here alone.”

A trace of surprise flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes, but she quickly calmed down.

For such a young child to come so far alone, wasn’t her family worried about her?

Fortunately, nothing happened along the way.

Qiao Nian couldn’t interfere too much in other people’s affairs. It wouldn’t be good if her family was unhappy.

Qiao Nian glanced at Gu Qi, then at Xiao Xian. She asked, “Xiao Shi, I want you and Xiao Qi to do a DNA test. I wonder if you’re willing?”

She had heard from others that DNA testing was used to determine if the other party was her relative.

“Okay.” Although Xiao Shi had already confirmed that Brother Xiao Qi was her brother, outsiders might think that she and Brother Xiao Qi were not family. She did not want there to be any misunderstanding between her and Brother Xiao Qi.

This was also Qiao Nian’s first time at the Dongjiang villa. She wasn’t familiar with the situation here, so she could only ask Gu Qi for a nail clipper.

Gu Qi handed the nail clipper to Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian squatted down in front of Xiao Shi and took her hand, preparing to cut her nails.

However, when Qiao Nian touched her palm, she was stunned.

She was clearly just a child, but her palms were covered in calluses. If she wasn’t wrong, she should have been working at home often.

In today’s society, children were all pampered. Even if they were from families with poorer conditions, it was impossible for them to let a five-year-old child work. Why would their family members let them do so much work when they were young?

She didn’t know how she had lived all these years. Her heart ached a little.

Her grip on Xiao Shi softened a little, afraid that she would hurt her.

Xiao Shi sensed Qiao Nian’s movements and felt a strange feeling in her heart. The hand Auntie Nian Nian touched seemed to have a warm current flowing through her veins.

She looked up at Qiao Nian. For some reason, she couldn’t help but want to get close to her.

Auntie Nian Nian was really a very gentle and good person!

Qiao Nian carefully trimmed Xiao Xue’s nails, then put them all into a bag.

Xiao Shi had heard from others that a DNA test required a blood test. She looked at Qiao Nian in confusion and asked, “Auntie Nian Nian, don’t you need to draw my blood?”

“There’s no need. Your nails are enough.” After Qiao Nian packed her nails, she helped Xiao Qi cut his and put them into another bag.
