908 Good Child

Qiao Nian had always known that Xiao Shi was a sensitive child. Seeing that Xiao Shi was hesitating to speak, she silently wiped the tears off her face before letting go.

Xiao Shi sat where she was. Her face was red from crying, and her eyes were swollen.

Qiao Nian took out a tissue and carefully wiped the tears off Xiao Shi’s face. Then, she said softly, “Xiao Shi, if you have anything to say, tell Mommy.”

Xiao Shi looked up. There were still tears on her long eyelashes, and her wet eyes were fixed on Qiao Nian.

!!

She pursed her lips, looking unwilling to speak.

“If you have any thoughts, Mommy will try her best to help you.” Qiao Nian smiled gently and tucked her hair behind her ear. “You’re Mommy’s good child. A good child has to express her thoughts bravely, understand?”

Xiao Shi was slightly stunned.

This was the first time she had heard someone say that a good child had to express her thoughts bravely. Was it so simple to be a good child?

In the past, in Hai Cheng, Song Man had asked her to work every day. Only when she did a lot of work would Song Man be happy and praise her for being a good child.

Xiao Shi hesitated for a moment and asked seriously, “Mommy, can I visit her?”

As she spoke, she studied Qiao Nian’s face carefully.

Qiao Nian paused for a moment. Xiao Shi was very careful and her heart felt as if it was being pricked by countless needles. It was so painful that it was difficult to breathe.

How could Xiao Shi take so long to consider such a small request?

“She’s going to visit Song Man, right?” Qiao Nian looked at Xiao Shi with heartache.

Xiao Shi was a little surprised. She said obediently, “She used to be my favorite mommy. I’ve thought it through. She won’t be my mommy anymore. I want to say goodbye to her.”

Xiao Shi recalled that on the way back from the hospital, she vaguely saw Song Man smiling at her.

“Sure.” Qiao Nian smiled and agreed. Seeing Xiao Shi heave a sigh of relief, she asked worriedly, “Aren’t you afraid?”

Xiao Shi shook her head and said, “I’m not afraid anymore.”

She wanted to make things clear to Song Man. She wanted to tell her that she would live a good life and hoped that Song Man would be a gentle mommy in the future.

When she knew that Song Man loved her, she was no longer afraid.

A faint smile appeared on Qiao Nian’s face, like the winter sun, filled with warmth.

For a moment, Xiao Shi was stunned.

Qiao Nian touched Xiao Shi’s little face. Xiao Shi looked very similar to her. Although she looked weak on the surface, she was very strong in her bones and was unafraid of all difficulties.

Qiao Nian pulled Xiao Shi into her arms and smiled. “Good child!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Xiao Shi’s heart instantly skipped a beat. Her eyes widened in disbelief. So telling the truth would mean being praised as a “good child”.

At this moment, Xiao Shi felt the coldness around her gradually disappear, leaving only the warmth of Qiao Nian hugging her.

She reached out and tried her best to hug Qiao Nian.

She really liked Mommy Nian Nian. Mommy Nian Nian was too good.

“Mommy, can I listen to a bedtime story?” Xiao Shi asked carefully, her eyes filled with anticipation.

“Okay.” Qiao Nian let go of Xiao Shi and met her sparkling eyes.

Xiao Shi’s eyes seemed to be filled with stars. They were frighteningly bright.

Qiao Nian helped Xiao Shi lie down on the bed and lay down beside her. She helped Xiao Shi cover herself with the blanket. “In the past, there was a beautiful little princess. She…”

Xiao Shi leaned against Qiao Nian and obediently closed her eyes. Listening to Qiao Nian’s gentle voice, she gradually fell asleep.

When she fell asleep, there was a smile on her lips, as if something beautiful had happened in her dream.

Qiao Nian looked at Xiao Shi in her arms. Gradually, her heart was soothed by Xiao Shi’s sleeping appearance. The restlessness and fear in her heart had already disappeared.

Outside Xiao Shi’s room.

Gu Zhou leaned against the door. He could still vaguely hear Qiao Nian telling a story. He pursed his lips tightly, his heart aching as if it had been hollowed out.

He slowly closed his eyes and stood at the door of Xiao Shi’s room.
