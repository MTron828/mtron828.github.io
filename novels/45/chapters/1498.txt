1499 For a Man

Although that woman was lucky enough to discover the Falling Autumn Grass, she could still let that woman die without a burial ground.

When the woman turned her face, Annie got a good look at it and gasped.

How could there be a woman who was prettier than her in this world? Moreover, she was an Asian woman.

Annie frowned. Jealousy and anger instantly welled up in her heart.

She was the most beautiful person in the world. Anyone who was prettier than her should go to hell.

A trace of killing intent flashed in Annie’s eyes. She was already dissatisfied that that woman had ruined her plans. Now that woman was actually better-looking than her. Such a woman was not worthy of living in this world.

Annie tucked her hair behind her ear. Even though she was drenched, she was still an arrogant princess of Europe. She looked up and said mockingly, “Uncle, it’s just a stalk of Falling Autumn Grass. Aunt needs more than one stalk of Falling Autumn Grass for her illness. I just want him. With him, everything will be fine.”

Towards the end, Annie glanced at Gu Zhou, who was standing not far away. She swallowed hungrily. Such a top-notch man was rare.

Annie tried hard to remain calm. With a bright smile on her face, her gaze fell on the president’s face. “Uncle, make a decision quickly!”

The atmosphere instantly froze, but Annie stood there calmly, as if nothing had anything to do with her.

Her gaze was fixed on Gu Zhou’s face. From the beginning to the end, he was the only person she wanted. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The President gripped the pot of Falling Autumn Grass tightly, frowning. His eyes were cold.

Qiao Nian raised her eyebrows slightly. She looked at Princess Annie, who was standing not far away, curiously. When she first arrived, Lina had already told her that every once in a while, Princess Annie would send the Falling Autumn Grass to the palace.

Princess Annie looked completely different from Lina. Princess Annie’s skin was snow-white, and her long burgundy hair was plastered tightly to her body with wetness, like a mermaid who had just climbed out of the water.

Qiao Nian noticed that Princess Annie’s gaze was fixed on Gu Zhou’s face. She frowned, a trace of displeasure flashing in her eyes.

How annoying!

Qiao Nian narrowed her eyes, which were cold. She asked casually, “Mr. President, do you need Falling Autumn Grass?”

When the president heard Qiao Nian’s question, the darkness in his eyes gradually dissipated. He had already planned to place all his hopes on Qiao Nian. Now that he heard Qiao Nian’s question, he naturally said cooperatively, “The Falling Autumn Grass can help calm Madam down!”

When Qiao Nian heard the President’s words, she instantly understood. The fragrance of Falling Autumn Grass had the effect of stabilizing one’s emotions.

Previously, he had also seen a broken deciduous plant pot in Madam President’s room. The Falling Autumn Grass inside was almost withered.

Qiao Nian roughly understood why Princess Annie dared to threaten the president fearlessly in front of so many people. It turned out that she was relying on Falling Autumn Grass.

Qiao Nian’s beautiful fox-like eyes sparkled. Her lips curved up slightly as she nodded and said, “I see!”

The president looked at Qiao Nian in confusion, not understanding what she meant. After some hesitation, he couldn’t help but ask, “Madam Gu, do you know how to cultivate Falling Autumn Grass?”

When Annie heard the president’s question, she laughed out loud. There was mockery on her face, as if she had heard the funniest joke in the world.

There were very few people in the world who could cultivate Falling Autumn Grass. Almost all the good people who could cultivate Falling Autumn Grass were on her family list. Those people were already on the same side as her father. She didn’t know that there were others who could cultivate Falling Autumn Grass.

Annie was laughing so hard that tears welled up in her eyes. She looked at the President mockingly, raised her eyebrows slightly, and said provocatively, “Uncle, are you still not giving up? You’re already so old, but you’re living like a child. How can you be the President of Europe if you’re so naive?”

Annie paused for a moment and continued, “You know how difficult it is to cultivate Falling Autumn Grass, right? Previously, you wanted to hire people from overseas to cultivate it, but in the end, no one could help you cultivate it. To tell you the truth, no one who can cultivate Falling Autumn Grass can help you cultivate it.”
