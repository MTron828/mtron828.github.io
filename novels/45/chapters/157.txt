Chapter 158 Little Angel

Qiao Nian gave Jiang Yue a meaningful look. This woman could indeed cause trouble for Gu Zhou. She knew when to advance and when to retreat, and was extremely cunning.

After Qiao Nian retracted her gaze, she walked towards the resting room, preparing to change into her gown. She did not notice Gu Zhou and Lu Zhu walking over at all.

When Qiao Nian walked out of the resting room, she saw three young girls walking towards her, arm in arm. They were clearly looking for her. “Miss Qiao,” the girl standing in the middle greeted softly. Qiao Nian stopped in her tracks. She remembered this young girl. She was the one who had spoken up for her just now. The girl looked at Qiao Nian with a guilty expression and said, “I’m really sorry for disturbing you just now. I must have ruined your good mood. I’m very sorry.” There were too many people around them previously, and Qiao Nian’s attention was entirely on Jiang Yue and Liu Yu, so she hadn’t taken note of the girl’s features.

When she took a good look at the young girl in front of her, she was momentarily stunned. The girl’s facial features were exquisite and delicate, and her skin seemed to be as fine and thin as gossamer. She looked extremely sweet. Just by taking a glance, one would immediately sense that she was an obedient and adorable little girl.

What Qiao Nian liked about her the most was that this young girl had the same fox-like eyes as she did. However, her eyes looked charming and sultry, while this young girl’s eyes were sweet and innocent.

Qiao Nian smiled at the girl. “It’s their fault. This has nothing to do with you. You don’t have to apologize for them.”

“It’s not like that.” The girl looked at Qiao Nian earnestly as she shook her head. The pearl earring on her ear swayed, setting off the charm of her small face.

The two girls standing next to her nodded in agreement, their expressions apologetic. The girl pursed her lips and said gently, “The seniors shouldn’t have said those outrageous things, much less attempt to defile your name. They don’t even know you well, yet they insisted that you were of bad character. That was clearly wrong.”

When the girl said this, her lips pursed slightly. She continued, “More importantly, for you to be invited by Director Lin to be the first lecturer, I believe that you’re someone outstanding. You came to our school to give a speech to enlighten us students. If we still choose to misconstrue your intentions, then the story of the snake and the farmer will repeat itself. Furthermore, your indifferent gaze just now seemed to be filled with disappointment towards the entire world…”

The girl looked at Qiao Nian seriously and continued, “There’s not only darkness in this world, but also much beauty.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The other two little girls said, “Teacher Qiao, I hope you won’t remember the unhappy events that happened today.” Qiao Nian looked at the three girls in front of her, pursing her lips. Just for a moment, she felt a little choked up. She had seen too much injustice in this world, and had received too much unfair treatment. She was already numb to such things.

But today, someone was telling her that there was still beauty in this world. Not just darkness. Qiao Nian’s eyes stung a little. She looked at the young girl in front of her for a long time before she spoke. “You…” “Qi Qi.”

A gentle voice rang out from the side, interrupting Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian froze. She found the voice familiar. She looked up and saw Lu Zhu walking over, holding a book.

Lu Zhu looked exactly like how she had seen him in the past. He looked like an elegant gentleman.

The young girl’s eyes were filled with laughter. She lifted her skirt slightly and jogged closer to the man, her eyes curving up beautifully. “Brother, you’re here!”

“You’re already in your first year of university. You have to be more mature.” When Lu Zhu said this, his voice softened significantly. He looked at the girl with a doting expression on his face.

Only then did Qiao Nian realize that this young girl was Lu Zhu’s biological sister, the precious daughter of the Lu family, Lu Qi.

When Lu Qi heard Lu Zhu’s words, she immediately let go of Lu Zhu’s arm and stood up straight. “I’m already very mature. Where’s the book?”
