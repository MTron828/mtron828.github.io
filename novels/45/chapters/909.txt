910 Regular Visitor

Qiao Nian’s first reaction was to see Xiao Shi. Xiao Shi had been frightened last night.

However, before Qiao Nian could speak, Gu Qi said, “Grandma, a funeral parlor isn’t scary. I used to go there often. I’m already a regular at the funeral parlor!”

Regular visitor…

Qiao Nian was speechless. Was that how he should call himself?

!!

Matriarch Gu hurriedly prayed piously, “Bodhisattva, don’t blame me. Bodhisattva, don’t blame me. A child’s words carry no harm. A child’s words carry no harm. Bodhisattva, don’t stoop to the level of a child!”

After praying, Matriarch Gu’s mood improved a little. Only then did she look at Gu Qi and say meaningfully, “Xiao Qi, you can’t say such things in the future. The funeral parlor isn’t an ordinary place. You can’t say that you’re a regular visitor there.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Although Gu Qi didn’t understand much, he still agreed obediently and corrected himself. “Yes, I often go to the funeral parlor to play!”

Matriarch Gu was speechless.

The funeral parlor was a place for dead people. Gu Qi was really fearless.

Qiao Nian didn’t know whether to laugh or cry at Gu Qi’s words. She said, “Grandma, the first time I saw him, he was at the funeral home.”

Matriarch Gu no longer wanted to mention the funeral parlor. Gu Qi was really bold.

“Alright.” Matriarch Gu planned to relent. If she didn’t stop, she didn’t know what Gu Qi would say. “Then hurry up and come back. Don’t stay too long!”

“Alright.” Qiao Nian smiled and agreed.

After breakfast, Qiao Nian brought Gu Qi and Xiao Shi into the car.

The two little ones sat in the back seat of the car. Qiao Nian carefully checked their seatbelts. After confirming that there were no problems, she walked to the driver’s seat and sat down.

Qiao Nian drove towards the funeral home.

Xiao Shi clenched her fists tightly and placed them on her knees, looking nervous. In order to appear more relaxed, she turned to look out of the car window. Looking at the retreating scenery along the way, she recalled Song Man jumping off the building, and fear gradually appeared in her eyes.

Gu Qi sat at the side. His attention was on Xiao Shi. Seeing that Xiao Shi didn’t look well, he reached out and held her hand.

The fear in her eyes instantly disappeared. She came back to her senses and turned to look at Gu Qi, who was sitting beside her. She called out softly, “Brother.”

“It’ll be fine. Don’t be afraid!” Gu Qi comforted her with a smile.

Xiao Shi nodded obediently.

Gu Qi heaved a sigh of relief. His gaze inadvertently swept across the empty seat between him and Xiao Shi. There were two folded pieces of A4 paper.

Gu Qi retracted his hand and opened the A4 paper curiously.

Xiao Shi also leaned over and looked at the contents of the paper curiously.

When the two of them saw the line of words at the bottom, their eyes widened.

Gu Qi and Qiao Nian were mother and son.

During this period of time, Gu Qi had seen many DNA reports. When he saw this line of words, his expression changed.

Mommy?

Was this Mommy and his DNA report?

He was actually Mommy’s child.

Gu Qi and Xiao Shi looked at each other. The two of them looked at the piece of paper below them.

Xiao Shi and Qiao Nian were mother and daughter.

The two children’s eyes were filled with shock, joy, and disbelief.

Xiao Shi’s eyes grew redder and redder. Although she was willing to let Auntie Nian Nian be her mommy, she wanted to see her biological mother more.

No wonder she was happy when she saw Mommy Nian Nian. No wonder she liked Mommy Nian Nian from the bottom of her heart. No wonder she couldn’t help but want to get close to Mommy Nian Nian.

So Mommy Nian Nian was her biological mother!

Gu Qi was thinking about something else.

When he found out that his biological mother was still alive, his mind was filled with thoughts of meeting her. He often fantasized about his biological mother and her personality.

Sometimes, he would wonder why his biological mother didn’t look for him. Was it because she didn’t like him or something else?

Later on, he gradually gave up. When he saw Song Man, he felt that it no longer mattered who his biological mother was.

Mommy Nian Nian could give him all the love he wanted. As long as he had Mommy Nian Nian in his future, that would be fine.

But when he found out that Mommy Nian Nian was his biological mother, he was even happier.
