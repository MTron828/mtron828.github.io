1052 You Don’t Have to Go

In the past, Qiao Nian had felt that her childhood had been unhappy. Her parents didn’t love her and she had been thrown into the mountains.

When she found her family, she realized that she was happy. Her family had always missed her, and her childhood experiences were ruined by outsiders.

From another perspective, those who treated her badly were all outsiders, and her family had always missed her.

In that case, she was still very happy.

!!

But Gu Zhou was different.

Gu Zhou’s biological parents were relatively cold to him. He only existed for his brother.

Seeing that Qiao Nian had her head lowered, Gu Zhou’s expression darkened. He stared unblinkingly at her beautiful face and said, “If you don’t want to go, you don’t have to.”

Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou in surprise.

When she married into the Gu family, she had never seen Gu Zhou’s mother. Now that she was going to see Gu Zhou’s mother, she had a strange feeling.

Before Qiao Nian could think clearly, she heard Gu Zhou say, “If you don’t want to go, then don’t. I don’t want you to do anything you don’t like.”

What Gu Zhou did not say was that he did not want his mother to sized up Nian’er with those cold eyes.

He did not want Nian’er to suffer any grievance.

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she frowned slightly and said worriedly, “But she… she’s your mother.”

“Heh.” Gu Zhou smiled sarcastically, his voice as cold as ice. “She doesn’t treat me as her child either!”

Qiao Nian was stunned. When she thought of what Gu Zhou’s mother had done, her heart couldn’t help but ache for him.

Although she had grown up in the Qiao family, when she reunited with the Lu family, she knew that everyone in the Lu family had been missing her. Every year, they would celebrate her birthday and the anniversary of her death.

Everyone in the Lu family remembered her and did not forget her for a moment. This made her feel very precious!

The Lu family was a place filled with love. Everyone in the family would love each other.

Even in the Qiao family, even if Su Xue didn’t like her, even if Qiao Shan didn’t like her, the couple still loved Qiao Yu and Qiao Xin a lot.

Qiao Nian stared unblinkingly at Gu Zhou. She didn’t understand why a mother didn’t like her child.

“I want to go with you!” Qiao Nian said firmly.

Just as Gu Zhou was about to say something, he saw the determination in Qiao Nian’s eyes and knew that she had made up her mind!

He gripped Qiao Nian’s hand tightly, a smile appearing in his eyes. “Okay!”

…

Time was running out. Qiao Nian finished making the pills and went upstairs to change into a crescent-white gown. She put on simple makeup and tied her hair up high. She looked extremely elegant and noble.

This time, Gu Zhou was driving. When the car arrived at the high-end cafeteria Bai Hui had told him, he glanced at Qiao Nian worriedly. He regretted telling Qiao Nian this.

He was very happy that Qiao Nian was willing to come with him, but he was also afraid that Qiao Nian would suffer.

Qiao Nian seemed to sense Gu Zhou’s concerns. Her lips curved up slightly as she said with a smile, “It’s getting late. Let’s go up!”

Gu Zhou unbuckled his seatbelt and got out of the car. He walked to the passenger door and held Qiao Nian’s hand as they walked in.

When the two of them arrived at the entrance of the cafeteria, the attendant in the private room hurriedly greeted them with a smile. “Please come in!”

“We already have an appointment. Peony Hall!”

When the attendant heard Gu Zhou’s words, a trace of embarrassment flashed across her face. After bowing to Gu Zhou, she said, “May I know who you are?”

“Gu Zhou!”

The attendant continued, “Hello, Mr. Gu. Madam Bai has already booked the peony hall, but she said that only you are allowed to enter!”

Gu Zhou couldn’t help but grip Qiao Nian’s hand tightly. Although he had long known that his mother was very dissatisfied with his marriage, he had never expected her to be unwilling to see Qiao Nian.

Gu Zhou confirmed, “Did she really say that?”

The attendant looked awkward and nodded. “Yes.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze slightly. Gu Zhou’s mother was establishing an imposing air. She wanted to tell her clearly that she wasn’t worthy of appearing in front of them.
