“You.” Qiao Nian looked at Zheng He, who was standing not far away. She curled a finger and said coldly, “Get over here and apologize!”

Previously, when Qiao Nian said anything like this, everyone felt that she was just putting on an empty show of strength.

But now, everyone was looking at Zheng He with gloating expressions. None of them liked a little bully like Zheng He.

Zheng He looked at Qiao Nian in shock. He had already been thoroughly humiliated. This young lass still wanted him to apologize.

Pft!

She could dream on!

Zheng He looked at Zheng Xiang, who was not far away. He hadn’t expected his cousin to lose to this little girl.

He glanced at the people Zheng Xiang had brought with him. Although they were all of good build, their skills were much weaker than Zheng Xiang’s.

However, as the saying went, two fists were no match for four.

Zheng He rolled his eyes and glanced at the seven of them. “What are you waiting for? Hurry up and attack!”

When the onlookers heard Zheng He’s words, they looked toward him with contempt. They had never seen such a shameless man.

Then, they turned to look at Qiao Nian worriedly. Even if Qiao Nian was skilled, there were seven of them on the other side. Qiao Nian still didn’t have a chance of winning.

However, the battle ended after barely a second. In a flash, the seven men were beaten to the ground, much to everyone’s disbelief.

In that instant, many young daughters present, who were from wealthy families, became Qiao Nian’s fans.

Each one of them had been pampered and spoiled from a young age. They had always been told to be ladylike, to be educated and polite, etc. They had never seen such a hot-blooded scene. They were so excited that they all began to applaud.

“Qiao Nian is so amazing. How can she be so cool? I want her to teach me martial arts!”

“Oh my god, she’s the modern version of the Fairy Sister, Wang Yuyan from Eight Books of the Heavenly Dragon!”

“Hubby Qiao Nian, I want to give birth to your child!”

…

In her high heels, Qiao Nian approached Zheng He step by step. She looked at him expressionlessly and said, “Kneel! Apologize!”

Zheng He belonged to the main branch of the Zheng family. He would inherit the family business in the future. He had already been humiliated when he wet his pants here just now.

If he knelt down and begged Qiao Nian for mercy, he would be even more humiliated. He would lose every shred of his dignity.

Zheng He lifted his chin slightly and stood there unmoving, refusing to kneel. He wanted to run from the scene, but his legs had turned to jelly in fear of Qiao Nian. His legs refused to obey his commands.

Qiao Nian kicked Zheng He’s knee sharply, forcing him to kneel.

“Plop.”

Zheng He’s right leg, which Qiao Nian had kicked, had been dislocated. He fell to his knees uncontrollably.

Zheng He looked down at the cobblestones beneath his feet. His brain was still short-circuiting.

How had he lost?

There was no way he could have lost!

“Apologize!” Qiao Nian said, glaring at Zheng He coldly.

Due to her vigorous exercise, the lust drug in her body was flaring up at an even greater speed. Gradually, her face began to flush red.

She tried hard to suppress her bodily urges. If Zheng He had not come to find fault with her, she would have been able to get rid of the lust drug in her body long ago. She would no longer need to suppress it so bitterly.

Zheng He’s mind was in a mess. He looked up at Zheng Xiang, who had already stood up. Zheng Xiang’s arms were drooping uncontrollably. Zheng He knew that he could no longer count on Zheng Xiang.

Zheng Xiang gave Zheng He a glance and walked over to Qiao Nian’s side. With a cold expression, he said threateningly, “Master Zheng will never forgive you for bullying the Zheng family.”

Qiao Nian tucked her hair behind her ear elegantly. Smiling mockingly, she said, “The victor is king, and the loser is a thief. Now that you’ve lost to me, not only are you unwilling to admit defeat, but you’re even using someone else’s name to pressure me? Aren’t you embarrassed at all?”

The onlookers nodded in agreement. They were very happy to see the Zheng family being bullied.

“You…”

Before Zheng Xiang could finish speaking, Qiao Nian interrupted him.

“What about me? Since the young ones couldn’t beat me, you’ll call in the old ones? I’ve already understood how shameless this Zheng family is.”
