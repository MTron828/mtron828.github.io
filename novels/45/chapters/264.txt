Chapter 265: Husband

Zhao Qian, who was sitting beside Jiang Yue, ate her meal slowly, as if what had just happened had nothing to do with her.

Wang Xuan also sensed the tension on the table. She lowered her head and continued eating, not wanting to provoke anyone.

Of course, this was just a small interlude. After that, no one cared anymore.

After dinner, Qiao Nian remembered the autograph. Apart from that, she also wanted to play the violin in front of Mr. Dong Hua.

She had even thought of a track. She would play her favorite song from before, “Missing”.

Actually, she wasn’t trying to show off in front of Mr. Dong Hua on purpose. She simply liked this song too much.

If Mr. Dong Hua could give her some pointers, her violin playing abilities would definitely improve.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian hurriedly walked upstairs. When she went downstairs again, she was holding a violin. Panting, she walked up to Mr. Dong Hua, her hair slightly disheveled.

Qiao Nian’s actions instantly attracted everyone’s attention.

Jiang Yue stood at the side, looking at Qiao Nian with a complicated expression. She lowered her gaze slightly, deep in thought.

Zhao Qian looked at Qiao Nian worriedly, worried that Gu Zhou would get angry.

This time, Qiao Nian felt Gu Zhou’s cold and sharp gaze on her. She didn’t distance herself from Mr. Dong Hua just because of Gu Zhou’s gaze. Instead, she handed the violin in her hand to Mr. Dong Hua and tried hard to calm herself down. She said, “Mr. Dong Hua, you’ve just promised my husband that you’ll sign the violin.”

Gu Zhou’s dark expression instantly froze. He walked over to Qiao Nian and looked at her smiling face. His throat moved involuntarily.

Since when did Qiao Nian have such a high EQ?

She had taken the initiative to call him her husband.

Yes, this title was not bad!

Zhao Qian and Wang Xuan, who were standing at the side, couldn’t help but secretly laugh.

Jiang Yue’s face froze.

Husband?

How could Qiao Nian say such a mushy greeting so lightly?

Qiao Nian seemed to have long been used to this form of address. Had she already addressed Brother Ah Zhou this way in private? 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Jiang Yue’s eyes darkened. She clenched her fists tightly, her nails digging into her palms. Only pain could keep the smile on her face.

Qiao Nian had spoken so casually just now, but now she was getting nervous. Her ears couldn’t help but turn red.

Fortunately, when she was shy, her ears would only turn red. Most people wouldn’t notice this.

She really had no choice.

She was Gu Zhou’s official wife, and she wanted to be taught by her idol.

If she wanted to achieve her goal, of course, she had to please Gu Zhou first. Then, she had to make Gu Zhou and Mr. Dong Hua look good. That way, the chances of her receiving guidance from Mr. Dong Hua would be higher.

Lu Nian looked at Qiao Nian, who was standing in front of him. Her expectant eyes were exactly like his younger sister’s.

Speaking of which, it had been a long time since he had seen Lu Qi.

In a daze, Lu Nian felt that Gu Zhou’s wife looked a little similar to Lu Qi. The only difference was their auras.

Seeing that Lu Nian was silent, Qiao Nian called out softly, “Mr. Dong Hua?”

Lu Nian came back to his senses. His thin lips curved up slightly, and a flirtatious smile appeared on his face. He said, “Actually, you don’t have to treat me like an outsider. Just call me by my name. Dong Hua is just my stage name.”

When Qiao Nian heard this, she frowned slightly and shook her head. She said firmly, “No!”

She liked Mr. Dong Hua, not Lu Nian, who was standing in front of her.

Even though they were the same person, the way she addressed him was completely different.

Lu Nian didn’t correct Qiao Nian anymore. He lowered his head and wrote his stage name on the violin.

Qiao Nian looked at the name on the violin, and her slightly furrowed brow gradually relaxed. The corners of her mouth curved up slowly, revealing a bright smile.
