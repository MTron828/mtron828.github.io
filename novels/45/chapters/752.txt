“Then do you remember her face?” Qiao Nian asked.

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s question, he slowly closed his eyes and tried his best to recall the situation back then.

What he remembered most clearly was that she was very afraid and terrified. Her body kept trembling, as if she was terrified.

He could still smell the jasmine on her. That smell was not pungent at all. Instead, it smelled a little good.

It was so dark there that he couldn’t see her face at all.

After that incident, Gu Zhou went to investigate the girl. In the end, he found a thin young lady lying on the operating table.

She was covered in blood.

Gu Qi, who had just been born, was lying beside her.

Gu Zhou’s expression grew more and more serious. His brows furrowed deeper and deeper, and his breathing grew more and more erratic.

He had initially thought that the girl was Gu Qi’s mother, but later on, he realized that he had misunderstood. Gu Qi’s mother was someone else.

“I remember her saying that she’s only eighteen…” Gu Zhou’s voice trembled. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, her expression faltered slightly.

She recalled that night five years ago when she was pressed under a man. At that time, she was extremely afraid. She wanted to escape, but she was imprisoned and could not.

“I’m just eighteen. Please, let me go… let me go. I’ll give you money. I’ll give you as much as you want.”

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but shiver. She looked down and saw that the goosebumps on her arms had risen.

She could imagine how helpless and painful Gu Qi’s biological mother had been back then.

“She was very afraid of me, and her words were incoherent…” Gu Zhou recalled what had happened that night. Emotions surged in his eyes, and he blamed himself very much. “I’ve let her down in that matter. I wanted to take responsibility and marry her, but I couldn’t find her…”

When Qiao Nian heard his words, she felt a little uncomfortable, but she quickly calmed down.

Gu Zhou and that girl were just pitiful people who had been schemed against. Actually, that girl was the most pitiful. Her innocence had been ruined for no reason, and she had even given birth to a child. She could not even be with her own child.

She sat down next to Gu Zhou and reached out to hold his hand, as if to calm his uneasy emotions. “If you really can’t remember, then don’t think about it. We can take our time searching. I think she’s also looking for Xiao Qi, because no mother will give up searching for her child.”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he grabbed her hand. His grip was strong, as if he was worried that Qiao Nian would leave him.

Qiao Nian frowned imperceptibly and comforted him. “Since you can’t remember, don’t think about it anymore.”

“Nian Nian.”

“Huh?” Qiao Nian’s expression faltered. Could it be that Gu Zhou’s personality had already changed? Was he now Zhou Zhou?

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian inadvertently met Gu Zhou’s frightened and uneasy expression. Her voice was helpless. “I once hurt… hurt someone, but I can’t remember anything. Nian Nian!”

Qiao Nian met Gu Zhou’s pure gaze and was completely certain of her guess.

She sighed slightly and called out softly, “Zhou Zhou?”

He looked up at Qiao Nian, his eyes filled with sorrow. “Nian Nian, I’ve become a bad child. I’m so sad!”

He spoke helplessly, as if he was trying hard to remember who he had hurt, but he couldn’t remember.

Seeing Gu Zhou like this, Qiao Nian completely understood. It seemed that Zhou Zhou had come out.

Could it be that in Gu Zhou’s subconscious mind, he felt that he was the unnecessary one, the unloved one, and the abandoned one?

Qiao Nian recalled Gu Zhou’s birth and his childhood. Perhaps that experience had created Zhou Zhou.

She looked at Gu Zhou with heartache and involuntarily hugged him.

When one was at their worst, perhaps what one needed the most was a hug.

Qiao Nian patted his back gently and comforted him in a low voice. “Zhou Zhou, everything in the past is in the past. Don’t think about what you can’t remember anymore. I’ve also encountered many things, and I can’t remember those things either. Therefore, sometimes, it’s normal for people to not be able to remember the past.”
