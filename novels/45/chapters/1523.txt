1524 You’re So Smart

Seeing that Qiao Nian was deep in thought, Gu Zhou saw that she was still frowning. He raised his hand and gently smoothed the frown between Qiao Nian’s eyebrows. He said softly, “Actually, there’s someone else who knows the truth.”

Gu Zhou shook his head gently. Seeing that Qiao Nian was getting anxious again, he reached out to hold her hand and said softly, “Madam President must know about her plastic surgery.”

“That’s right. How could I have forgotten about this!” Qiao Nian looked enlightened. Madam President was the person involved. It was true that she had cerebral palsy. She might not analyze the pros and cons of everything, but she definitely knew if her face had undergone surgery.

If she had a good relationship with Madam President, she might be able to get a lot of information from Madam President.

Qiao Nian moved closer to Gu Zhou’s face and took the initiative to kiss him. Her eyes were filled with smiles as she said, “You’re really too smart!”

Gu Zhou stared at Qiao Nian’s lips with a burning gaze. They hadn’t been able to get close to each other for the past two days.

After drinking the tea, his Adam’s apple bobbed. He put down the teacup in his hand and took the cup from Qiao Nian.

“You… um.”

Qiao Nian’s remaining words were stuck in Gu Zhou’s mouth.

Gu Zhou placed the cup on the table and held the back of Qiao Nian’s head firmly with one hand, deepening the kiss.

The temperature in the room gradually heated up. Gu Zhou only let go of Qiao Nian when she was about to suffocate. His voice was sexy and low. “We should take more time to focus on ourselves and resolve the personal problems we couldn’t resolve properly. What do you think?”

His voice was like a feather gently brushing against her heart. It tickled, and she blushed uncontrollably.

Qiao Nian was a little stunned. Before she could say anything, Gu Zhou picked her up in his arms.

Qiao Nian subconsciously wrapped her arms around Gu Zhou’s neck. When she came back to her senses and struggled to leave, she didn’t expect Gu Zhou to be so strong.

“It’s not good to do it during the day!” Qiao Nian said softly. Meeting Gu Zhou’s lustful eyes, her heart began to race, as if it would jump out of her mouth the next moment.

“There’s nothing wrong with the daylight.”

“No… um!”

Before Qiao Nian could finish speaking, Gu Zhou’s lips covered hers.

Gradually, Qiao Nian was immersed in Gu Zhou’s gentleness.

It wasn’t until past ten at night that the two of them ended. Qiao Nian ate a little and fell asleep.

…

Qiao Nian was woken up by Lina’s call. She touched her cell phone and picked up the call. She saw that Gu Zhou had already woken up. “Good morning, Lina.”

Qiao Nian sat up. She could hear the unhappiness in Lina’s voice. She frowned slightly and asked, “Lina, did something happen to Madam President?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“No, no.” Lina hurriedly denied it. “Ever since my mother drank your tonic, she’s been in a much better state of mind. My father is also very happy.”

“Then what are you worried about?” Qiao Nian frowned slightly. She hadn’t interacted much with Lina, but she could sense that she was very unhappy.

When Lina heard Qiao Nian’s words, her eyes couldn’t help but turn red. She said softly, “Nian Nian, do you want to discuss with Mr. Gu about staying in the palace?”

“Huh?” A trace of confusion flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes.

“Uncle is insisting that we let Annie go. I’m worried that Uncle will vent his anger on you,” Lina said uneasily.

Qiao Nian’s eyes darted around. With a plan in mind, she began to stall for time. “Alright, I’ll discuss it with my husband first.”

Qiao Nian comforted Lina a few more times before hanging up.

Qiao Nian had long wanted to stay in the palace. The reason why she wanted to go home yesterday was entirely because she wanted the President to consider whether to take out all of Madam President’s medical records.

Now that Earl Mark had begun to pressure the president, it was impossible for the president to pay attention to Madam President all the time. That way, she would have a chance to build a relationship with her.
