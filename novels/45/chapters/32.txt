Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief and swiftly changed out of her gown.

Initially, Qiao Nian had thought that that would be the end of it. However, by the time afternoon rolled around, she realized that this morning was just the beginning of her preparations for the banquet. Matriarch Gu had hired a makeup artist to help her with her makeup.

Four hours later, Qiao Nian changed into a gown, her makeup immaculate, and made her appearance at the Gu family villa.

Matriarch Gu’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. Qiao Nian’s beautiful eyes were clear and bright, like those of a forest deer, making it impossible for one to look away.

When Qiao Nian appeared at the Shen family’s banquet, everyone was stunned.

She looked like a fairy maiden from the heavenly realm, pure and flawless. She was so perfect that no one quite dared to touch her.

Qiao Xin stood next to Su Xue, her hands clenched into fists. Her nails dug into her palms as she glared at Qiao Nian with hatred.

She yearned for Qiao Nian to disappear from this world.

Five years ago, she managed to destroy Qiao Nian after much effort. She didn’t expect Qiao Nian to bounce back.

However, she was going to make Qiao Nian hit rock bottom tonight. When Qiao Nian got together with other men at Madam Shen’s birthday banquet, she wanted to see if Gu Zhou would still want her!

Qiao Xin lowered her gaze, worried that others would see the hatred in her eyes. She initially wanted Zhou Xue to do it, but Gu Zhou had sent Zhou Xue to the mental hospital, so Qiao Xin could only get others to help.

Matriarch Gu had brought Qiao Nian to the banquet today to let everyone know that Qiao Nian was now the Second Young Madam of the Gu family. It was also a show of support for Qiao Nian. Matriarch Gu wanted everyone to forget about Qiao Nian’s past! Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Zhao Qian was wearing a white gown. When she went to pick out a gown today, she saw her great aunt coming out of the dress shop with Qiao Nian.

Zhao Qian recalled that her great aunt used to go with her to pick out dresses in the past. Today, not only did she not do so, but she also did not bring her along to the banquet.

Seeing Matriarch Gu exchange greetings with Matriarch Shen, Zhao Qian obediently walked up to Old Madam Gu and greeted sweetly, “Great Aunt!”

When Matriarch Gu saw Zhao Qian, the smile on her face widened. She said softly, “Qian Qian, you’re getting prettier!”

“Thank you for your compliment, Great Aunt!”

Matriarch Gu turned to look at Qiao Nian, her eyes gentle. Speaking in a soft voice, she said, “Go somewhere else and have fun. Call me if you need anything!”

Qiao Nian had initially wanted to leave to ask the other members of the Shen family about Shen Yue anyway, so she nodded in assent.

Matriarch Gu glanced at Zhao Qian and instructed, “Take your Second Sister-in-law somewhere else to play!”

Zhao Qian led Qiao Nian out of the room sullenly. Her face was expressionless as she said, “I’ve never been here before either. You can hang out here by yourself!”

With that, Zhao Qian left, betraying no emotions.

After leaving, Zhao Qian bumped into her friends. They stood together, chatting and laughing. Zhao Qian secretly kept an eye on Qiao Nian, who was not far away. In the beginning, Qiao Nian stood where she had left her, scrolling through her cell phone. After a while, she went up to the second floor. Seeing that, Zhao Qian began to sneak after her quietly.

In a room beside the bathroom on the second floor.

Zhao Qian hid herself in the room. She pushed the door slightly ajar. From afar, she saw Qiao Nian talking to a man in the bathroom.

Strange.

How could a woman like Qiao Nian be acquainted with other men?

Zhao Qian wanted to move closer and eavesdrop on Qiao Nian’s conversation with the man, but she thought that she might expose her identity if she did so. She could only remain hidden where she was.

In the bathroom.

“Doctor Qiao, you and Matriarch Gu…” Shen Mo lowered his gaze, looking at the young lady in front of him. His words were a little hesitant. The news about Qiao Nian had long since spread in their social circle, but he had never believed that she would marry Gu Zhou.

“Young Master Shen, where has your cousin Shen Yue gone?” Qiao Nian could not find out where Shen Yue was. Her only hope was to get information about Shen Yue from Shen Mo.

At Qiao Nian’s words, Shen Mo’s heart, which had been in his throat, gradually settled back down. Clearing away his private conjectures, he said in a low voice, “She… she went overseas to study.”

“Which country is she in? Do you have her contact information?” Qiao Nian asked eagerly. If the Shen family wanted to hide someone, it would be an easy task.

Shen Mo looked at Qiao Nian in confusion. Softly, he asked, “Miss Qiao, you…”

“I would like to consult Shen Yue regarding some matters. I didn’t see Miss Shen Yue downstairs just now, so…” Qiao Nian’s expression took on a tinge of disappointment as she spoke.

“As you know, I’ve been trapped in a mental hospital all this time. In the past, I couldn’t sneak out of the hospital in case my family found out. This delay has lasted for five years!”

At Qiao Nian’s words, Shen Mo frowned slightly and said, “Miss Qiao, don’t worry. I’ll help you ask.”

“Thank you, Young Master Shen.”

Shen Mo looked at Qiao Nian’s faint smile and the dimples in her cheeks. He could not help but smile in return.. “Doctor Qiao, you’re too polite. I still have to thank Doctor Qiao for saving my life back then!”
