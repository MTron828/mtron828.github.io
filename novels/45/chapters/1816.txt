Chapter 1817 - 1817 Family

Chang Feng smiled and nodded. “Why are you suddenly so serious?”

“If one day I’m in danger and I won’t tell you even if you ask me, what will you do?”

When Chang Feng heard Qiao Nian’s words, he frowned. “What can’t you tell me? Nian Nian, if there’s really anything wrong, you have to tell me as soon as possible. That way, we can resolve it together.”

Chang Feng’s eyes were filled with worry and stubbornness. He would not allow any harm to come to his junior sister. He would do his best to protect her.

Qiao Nian was touched. However, when she thought of the current situation, she smiled and said, “Eldest Senior Brother, you care about me so much. I care about you too.”

At this moment, Chang Feng understood what Qiao Nian meant. He looked up and saw that the green light had already lit up.

He started the car again. “I’m just wondering if I’ll see Xiao Bao this time. Will he still want…”

Xiao Bao had lived with Eldest Senior Brother and Brother Gu in MY for so long. To Xiao Bao, Chang Feng was someone close to him.

“Eldest Senior Brother, I think Xiao Bao definitely wants to see you,” Qiao Nian said affirmatively.

At that time, Cui Huai was putting pressure on Chen Sheng. If Xiao Bao still stayed in MY, he might be discovered by Cui Huai. That way, Xiao Bao would be in danger.

When Chang Feng heard Qiao Nian’s words, he smiled and said, “Actually, I will be very satisfied as long as I see Xiao Bao.”

When Qiao Nian heard Chang Feng’s words, she felt a little uncomfortable.

She had been thinking about how had neglected her Eldest Senior Brother’s feelings because she kept thinking about going home.

Qiao Nian smiled at Chang Feng and said, “Eldest Senior Brother, don’t worry. Xiao Bao actually understands everything. He will definitely understand your choice at that time.”

Chang Feng chuckled and said, “Actually, it’s fine. Actually, I’m already very happy to see him from afar.”

Moreover, he believed that Xiao Bao would definitely be very happy living in the Gu and Lu families.

Soon, they arrived at the Lu family’s villa.

The news of Qiao Nian’s return had long reached the ears of the Lu family. At this moment, the Lu family was filled with joy. Even the servants were very happy. At this moment, the Lu family’s courtyard was decorated with lanterns.

The three little children lay on the bed together and looked at the chat history on the tablet, seriously analyzing the last message from their mommy.

Gu Qi looked at the content and analyzed in a childish voice, “Mom should have arrived in An City this morning. She even said that she would see Uncle Qin first. Perhaps she has a lot to say to Uncle Qin, so she hasn’t returned even when it’s dark.”

Hearing Gu Qi’s analysis, Xiao Bao looked at him anxiously and asked, “I really want to see Dad and Mom. I haven’t seen them in a long time.”

Previously, he had only played with his parents for a day in MY. After returning to An City, he had never interacted with them again.

Xiao Bao thought of Daddy and Uncle Chang Feng again. He wondered how they were doing now.

Xiao Shi’s eyes turned red.

Gu Qi was the eldest. At this moment, he set an example and quickly comforted his siblings. “Don’t worry. Daddy and Mommy miss us very much. They were probably held back by something else, so they didn’t come back immediately.”FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Xiao Shi nodded obediently and said in a gentle voice, “Daddy and Mommy must have been delayed by something. We’ll wait patiently at home. They’ll be back soon.”

Xiao Bao supported his chin with both hands and said obediently, “Alright.”

Xiao Shi could tell that Xiao Bao was disappointed. He quickly reached out and patted Xiao Bao’s head. “Second Brother, don’t be sad. I believe Mom and Dad will be back soon. If they’re not back yet, we’ll video call them!”

Xiao Bao sat up. He was the brother. How could he let his sister comfort him?

At this moment, Gu Qi, who was looking at his cell phone, suddenly sat up. His calm tone was mixed with surprise. “Mommy sent a message!”

Xiao Bao and Xiao Shi hurriedly leaned over and the three little heads squeezed together.

Gu Qi opened the chat box seriously.
