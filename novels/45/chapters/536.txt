“Does Grandma know what happened here?” Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou and asked.

Gu Zhou shook his head and said, “I didn’t tell her.”

“That’s good.” Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. She didn’t want Matriarch Gu to know what had happened to her.

Matriarch Gu was old and could not stand being agitated.

Gu Zhou’s thin lips curled up slightly as he said happily, “After I received Grandma’s call, I’ve already arranged for a flight in the afternoon. After Brother Zhu is discharged from the hospital, we can go straight to the airport. There will be medical staff along the way. After we reach An City, we’ll help Brother Zhu settle down and go home!”

Hearing Gu Zhou’s words, Qiao Nian nodded. She didn’t think there was anything wrong with this. “Okay.”

Qiao Nian seemed to have thought of something and couldn’t help but ask, “Does the Lu family know about the situation here?”

Gu Zhou’s gaze landed on Lu Zhu’s face and he said calmly, “This is Brother Zhu’s family matter. It’s not convenient for me to say anything.”

Hearing Gu Zhou’s words, Qiao Nian nodded, still a little worried.

She wondered if the Lu family would blame her if they found out that her brother had been injured so badly because of her.

Lu Zhu seemed to understand Qiao Nian’s thoughts. He comforted her, “My injury this time has nothing to do with you. Moreover, Song Yue’s death has nothing to do with you. All of this happened because she was careless. I won’t let my family make things difficult for you.”

Qiao Nian understood what Lu Zhu meant and nodded slightly.

At this moment, Doctor Sha walked in from outside. He walked to Lu Zhu and instructed him on some things to take note of before issuing a discharge certificate.

Chen Qing and Chen Shi also helped to pack up.

Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. She was finally going back to An City. She had been living in fear all day.

At this thought, Qiao Nian thought of Jiang Chi and what she had promised him.

However, this was not the right time to discuss Jiang Chi’s younger brother with his brother. These things could be discussed later.

Qiao Nian took out her phone, opened WeChat, and sent a message to Qin Chuan.

“Find a way to tell Jiang Chi that I’m back in the country now. Tell him not to worry. I’ll definitely do what I promised him. Tell him to wait for me patiently.”

Qin Chuan replied quickly. “What did you promise that lunatic?”

“Something about his brother.”

Qin Chuan quickly sent a very unhappy emoticon before typing a series of words. “Do you know that his younger brother is his bottom line? Don’t rub him the wrong way! If you provoke his younger brother, have you ever thought about the consequences? You’ve always thought things through before. Why are you so rash this time?”

If this had happened in the past, she would definitely have replied to Qin Chuan, “None of your business.” However, Qin Chuan had helped her and her brother this time, so Qiao Nian was more patient than usual.

“This matter is related to Lu Zhu. I have to interfere.”

Qin Chuan recalled his people’s account of what had happened that night. It could be said to have been soul-stirring. Even as a listener, he still had lingering fears. If things hadn’t been handled properly that night, he would have to deal with things in MY again.

Qin Chuan frowned and asked, “Have you already fallen for Lu Zhu?”

Qiao Nian was speechless and rolled her eyes silently. She couldn’t help but reply, “None of your business!”

After sending the message, Qiao Nian ignored Qin Chuan. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Just as Qiao Nian was about to turn off her phone, Gu Qi sent her a message.

“Auntie, when are you coming back after your business trip? I’ve ordered a big meal for you so that I can pay you back!”
