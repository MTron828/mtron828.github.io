Chapter 301: Background

Qiao Nian recalled Jiang Yue’s question to her and instantly understood.

So that was how it was. He was bothered by this.

Qiao Nian’s voice turned colder as well. “Actually, I didn’t want to have a child either. I was just joking with Jiang Yue. You don’t have to take it seriously.”

“That’s good.”

Gu Zhou’s voice was low and hoarse, making it impossible to tell his emotions.

Actually, Qiao Nian didn’t want to have a child at all. However, when Gu Zhou had mentioned this just now, she had thought that he really wanted to have a child with her.

Since he didn’t want to have children either, that was good.

However, when she thought about it, if the sun rose in the west one day and Gu Zhou insisted that she give birth, she would have a headache.

Now that Qiao Nian had relaxed, it didn’t take long for her to fall asleep.

In the darkness, Gu Zhou slowly opened his eyes. His eyes were like stars in the night sky, cold and deep.

He wasn’t sure if Qiao Nian would accept that child.

Four years ago, when he found Wang Lin, she was lying in a pool of blood.

Beside Wang Lin was a dying child. Wang Lin begged him to save the child.

After that, he did a paternity test with the child. This child was indeed related to him by blood.

For so many years, he had always thought that Wang Lin was the young lady who had spent that night with him because of this.

However, he had a strange feeling that Wang Lin wasn’t her.

Hence, he got someone to investigate it, but the results were fruitless. He also asked a famous hacker to help investigate it. The information the hacker found was identical to what he had found previously.

Last week, he suddenly thought of something.

If Wang Lin didn’t give birth to the child, it meant that someone else had spent the night with him.

He asked Chen Qing to get Wang Miao’s hair so that he could do a paternity test with the child.

It was probably at this moment that Jiang Yue found out about the existence of that child.

The results of the paternity test were out.

Wang Miao was not related to the child by blood.

This child was his and Wang Lin’s. Then who exactly gave birth to this child?

What concerned Gu Zhou the most was that when Qiao Nian’s adoptive mother came to save Qiao Xin, she had also mentioned Wang Lin.

That could only mean one thing.

Qiao Nian’s adoptive mother might know about what happened back then.

In that case, the investigation had to start with the Qiao family.

At the thought of this, Gu Zhou’s eyes grew colder and colder.

…

The next day, when Qiao Nian woke up, her bed was cold and she was alone.

It seemed that Gu Zhou had been awake for a long time.

After Qiao Nian got out of bed and washed up, she walked downstairs. She didn’t see Gu Zhou anywhere.

When she walked downstairs, she saw Jiang Yue sitting on the sofa, her face pale. A servant was massaging her neck.

When Qiao Nian passed by, she accidentally saw a mark on Jiang Yue’s neck. It seemed to have been caused by a snake. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Strange.

Why would a snake attack Jiang Yue for no reason?

When Jiang Yue saw Qiao Nian, she greeted politely, “Second Sister-in-law, good morning!”

Qiao Nian nodded indifferently. She wasn’t concerned about the wound on Jiang Yue’s neck. Instead, she walked towards the dining room. As soon as she entered, she saw Mr. Dong Hua and Matriarch Gu chatting casually. Zhao Qian, who was standing at the side, was grinning from ear to ear.

When Mr. Dong Hua saw Qiao Nian, he raised his beautiful phoenix-like eyes slightly and greeted her gently, “Good morning, Little Sister!”

When Qiao Nian heard Mr. Dong Hua address her as his sister, she was slightly stunned. She had always thought that this was just a casual remark. She didn’t expect Mr. Dong Hua to take it seriously.

When Matriarch Gu heard Lu Nian’s words, she said angrily, “You can’t call her that. You have to call her Second Sister-in-law!”

Lu Nian narrowed his beautiful phoenix-like eyes and licked his lips with her pink tongue. “Nian Nian, how do you think I should address you?”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She didn’t expect Lu Nian to throw this question at her.
