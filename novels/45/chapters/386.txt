Chapter 387: Regret

If she had known that Gu Qi was Gu Zhou’s child, she would have done her best to take good care of him and make him like her and stick to her. Perhaps Gu Zhou would have made her Gu Qi’s adopted mother on account of him liking her.

Jesus.

She had missed the chance to marry into a wealthy family.

The Gu family was one of the top wealthy families in An City.

It hurt!

It hurt…

Jiang Yue stood at the door anxiously. When she heard Qin Lu’s screams from inside, the uneasiness in her heart gradually grew, and a layer of cold sweat appeared on her back.

She did not know what had happened inside. The only thing she was sure of was that this was the first time she had seen Gu Zhou personally teach a woman a lesson.

In the past, Gu Zhou had never bothered to fight with women. He was not even willing to look at other women.

All of this was for Qiao Nian…

A trace of jealousy flashed across Jiang Yue’s eyes.

At that moment, the door opened.

Jiang Yue quickly put away her thoughts, and her heart skipped a beat. She looked at Gu Zhou and pretended to be calm. “Brother Ah Zhou, you should go back early. Grandma might still be worried about us.”

After Jiang Yue finished speaking, she pondered over what she had just said.

What she had just said should not have revealed anything.

Her voice was as gentle as before. Thinking of this, Jiang Yue heaved a sigh of relief.

However, what Jiang Yue did not know was that even though she had hidden her voice well, her pale face had already exposed the fear in her heart.

Gu Zhou’s gaze landed on Jiang Yue’s face for a moment before he walked away from her indifferently. “Chen Qing, drive the car over now.”

“Yes.”

Qiao Nian walked beside Gu Zhou, her gaze inadvertently landing on the sleeve of his blood-stained white shirt. Her eyes darkened slightly.

Qiao Nian’s heart suddenly skipped a beat. She looked at Gu Zhou in surprise. Although Qin Lu wanted to harm her, ahe had already suffered the consequences of his own actions. All Gu Zhou had to do was teach her a lesson. Why was he so harsh?

Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou’s face. The anger on his face hadn’t dissipated yet.

It turned out that Gu Zhou cared so much about his Mrs. Gu!

After coming downstairs alone, he walked out.

Song Yu happened to see Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian walking out together. A trace of confusion flashed across her eyes.

What was the relationship between Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou?

On her sister’s death anniversary, she had rushed back and bumped into Qiao Nian. At that time, Qiao Nian was with Old Madam Gu.

It wasn’t until Qiao Nian, Gu Zhou, and the others had left that Song Yu looked at Lu Nian curiously and asked in a low voice, “Second Brother, why are you here with Qiao Nian today?”

“We had an appointment!” After Lu Nian said that, he glanced at Song Yu coldly.

Hearing Lu Nian’s words, Song Yu was stunned. This was the first time she had seen Second Brother so close to another woman.

However, Song Yu quickly changed the topic and revealed a quiet smile. “Brother, Grandma was still asking me today about when you plan to go home to visit your sister.”

When Lu Nian heard this, he couldn’t help but frown. He hadn’t gone back on his sister’s death anniversary a while ago, and his grandmother had even called him to tell him about it.

Lu Nian hesitated for a moment before saying, “Let’s go back together later!”

Song Yu’s smile widened as she nodded. “Okay.”

“Second Brother, if you’re worried that Grandma will hit you, why don’t you stay in your sister’s room tonight?” Song Yu suggested with a smile.

As soon as she finished speaking, she noticed that Lu Nian’s expression had darkened. She recalled what she had just said and thought that there was nothing wrong.

Just as Song Yu was in a daze, she heard Lu Nian call out, “Song Yu.”

Song Yu felt inexplicably nervous and looked at Lu Nian in confusion.
