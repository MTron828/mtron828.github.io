1165 Hubby~

Thank you readers!

She had already chosen to be with Gu Zhou, so she did not want her family to make things difficult for her!

She planned to tell everyone that she had already given birth after the last child was found.

Qiao Nian was still thinking about the child when her phone suddenly vibrated.

Qiao Nian took out her phone and opened it. It was a WeChat message from Gu Zhou.

“Are you asleep?”

Although it was just three words, Qiao Nian seemed to hear Gu Zhou’s voice.

Every time Gu Zhou lay on the bed, his voice was a little low and hoarse, and a little nasal. It was much less cold than usual.

“I’m already used to hugging you to sleep. Now that you’re not by my side, what should I do?”

“Why don’t you hug the pillow to sleep?” Qiao Nian thought of Gu Zhou hugging the pillow, and her lips curved up slightly.

“The pillow isn’t as comfortable as yours. Has Lu Qi slept?”

Qiao Nian looked around and lowered her head to reply silently. “We we’re in the ancestral hall now. Mom asked our brothers to kneel as punishment, and we’ll be punished with them!”

Gu Zhou had initially replied to her message in seconds. Seeing that Gu Zhou didn’t reply, Qiao Nian put her phone away.

After a long while, Qiao Nian’s phone vibrated again. Two minutes had passed since Gu Zhou had last replied to her message.

“Nian’er, did you not think of me after we separated?”

Qiao Nian could almost see Gu Zhou’s resentful expression.

Just as Qiao Nian was thinking about how to reply to Gu Zhou, Gu Zhou sent her another text.

“We’ve been separated for a long time, and you didn’t ask me if I was used to living here in the Lu family. You don’t seem to remember me.”

Qiao Nian gripped her cell phone tightly. Although she wanted to quibble, Gu Zhou was indeed telling the truth.

At that time, she really didn’t seem to have thought of Gu Zhou. Her mind was filled with thoughts of her brothers being punished.

As long as she refused to admit it, Gu Zhou didn’t know that she didn’t miss him.

Qiao Nian replied to Gu Zhou. “Why would you think that? My mind is filled with you?”

“Then call me Hubby?” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Qiao Nian had indeed not thought about Gu Zhou at all previously. Gu Zhou’s question just now had made her feel a little guilty, so she obediently typed it out.

“Hubby~”

Gu Zhou was lying on his side, playing with his phone. When he saw Qiao Nian’s message, his lips curved up involuntarily.

Especially when he saw “~”. In a daze, he recalled Qiao Nian’s soft childish voice in bed. He seemed to hear Qiao Nian say that word in his ear.

Gu Zhou’s lower abdomen tightened, and his throat moved involuntarily. His breathing quickened!

“What a tormenting little vixen!”

After Gu Zhou sent the message, he did not receive any reply from Qiao Nian. His frown deepened.

Gu Zhou tossed and turned in bed, staring at his cell phone, waiting for Qiao Nian to reply!

After waiting for a long while, Qiao Nian didn’t reply. His frown deepened. He glanced at the time on his phone again. It had only been fifteen minutes since Qiao Nian had last replied to his message.

Gu Zhou finally understood what it meant to feel as if years had passed!

In the past, he had never thought that he would wait under the blanket because a girl did not reply to him. He would look at his cell phone in a daze and wait for that girl’s reply.

That girl really made him worry!

Gu Zhou hesitated for a moment and was about to send Qiao Nian a message when Qiao Nian sent him a message.

“Old demon, I’m at your door!”

Gu Zhou’s eyes lit up. He hurriedly put down his phone, lifted the blanket, put on his slippers, and walked towards the door.

The moment Gu Zhou opened the door, he saw the girl he had been longing for standing at the door.

She was wearing a white lace nightdress. Her hair was draped over her shoulders, and she had a smile on her face. Her eyes were curved into crescents, and she looked especially sweet!

She was like a fairy maiden who had descended from the sky. Her innocence and beauty made one unable to take their eyes off her!

Like a little fairy, she barged into his heart again.

Gu Zhou’s heart skipped a beat. In the next second, it began to race!
