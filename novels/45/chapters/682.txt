Qiao Nian smiled at Zhou Zhou and said, “Wait for me here. I’ll go to the bathroom to fill the bathtub for you.”

Zhou Zhou looked at Qiao Nian with sparkling eyes. He nodded and replied obediently, “Okay!”

Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. She turned around and walked towards the bathroom, thinking that she could finally calm down.

She had just taken a step when footsteps sounded behind her.

Qiao Nian stopped in her tracks and turned her head. She saw Zhou Zhou standing behind her.

When Zhou Zhou met Qiao Nian’s gaze, he gave an obedient smile.

Seeing Zhou Zhou like this, Qiao Nian sighed softly. Then, she smiled and asked, “Didn’t I ask you to wait for me over there just now?”

Zhou Zhou didn’t speak. He reached out and tugged at Qiao Nian’s skirt, looking at her with pitiful eyes.

Qiao Nian raised her hands in surrender and nodded with a smile. “Alright, let’s go together now.”

She really had no resistance to Zhou Zhou.

What made Qiao Nian the most helpless was that Zhou Zhou was really too clingy. No matter where she went, Zhou Zhou had to follow.

More than that, he kept tugging at her clothes.

Actually, Qiao Nian wasn’t used to others sticking to her like this. However, when she realized that this person was Zhou Zhou, any dissatisfaction in her heart had long disappeared. All that was left was helplessness.

After Qiao Nian walked into the bathroom, she filled the bathtub with hot water and reached out to test the temperature.

“The water temperature is just right. You should be…” Qiao Nian turned around, stunned.

He was taking off his clothes. Now was the time to unbutton the last button of his shirt.

Qiao Nian immediately saw his well-defined abs and his shirt hanging loosely on his body.

She felt her face heat up. Just as she was about to speak, she saw that the man had already loosened the belt around his waist.

Crack!

The sound of the belt being unbuckled was especially loud.

Qiao Nian’s face turned even redder, and even the tips of her ears began to burn.

She quickly looked away and asked, “Why did you take off your clothes?”

Zhou Zhou looked at Qiao Nian innocently and asked, “Nian Nian, you have to take off your clothes for a shower!”

Qiao Nian felt that her question was a little silly.

Who wouldn’t take off their clothes in the shower?

However, when she saw Zhou Zhou undo the strap, her heart skipped a beat.

Crap.

She was tempted.

If Zhou Zhou was a woman, no man would be able to resist her temptation.

It would bring disaster!

Qiao Nian closed her eyes slightly and took a deep breath. She hurriedly said, “You’re not allowed to take off your underwear. Go in and take a shower in your underwear!”

At this moment, Zhou Zhou had already taken off his shirt and pants, leaving only his underwear.

When he heard Qiao Nian’s words, his eyes were filled with confusion. In the end, he asked happily, “Nian Nian, are you going to help me take off my underwear?”

Qiao Nian’s entire face seemed to be filled with blood. It was as red as spider lilies in hell, looking extremely flirtatious.

She suspected that Zhou Zhou was seducing her, but she had no evidence because Zhou Zhou was really looking at her innocently.

Qiao Nian felt that she was the one with impure thoughts.

“Nian Nian…”

Zhou Zhou lowered his head slightly and looked at Qiao Nian in confusion.

Hearing the voice above her head, Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat. She slowly opened her eyes and looked at him.

When she saw Zhou Zhou’s clean eyes, her blood boiled.

Qiao Nian stood on her tiptoes and wrapped her arms around his neck. Without hesitation, she covered his sexy lips with hers.

In a daze, Qiao Nian seemed to see beautiful fireworks in the night sky.

Zhou Zhou’s body stiffened slightly, and his eyelashes trembled slightly. Qiao Nian’s face was reflected in his pupils.

Qiao Nian’s face was very pale under the light, and her skin looked very delicate. Her eyelashes trembled slightly.

Zhou Zhou looked at Qiao Nian in a daze.

After a while, when Qiao Nian was almost out of breath, she let go of Zhou Zhou.

She stood calmly on the ground and saw Zhou Zhou leaning against the basin. His face was pale, and he looked a little colder. However, his slightly red lips made her unable to help but kiss him again.
