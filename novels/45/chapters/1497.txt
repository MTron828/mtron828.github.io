1498 Forced

All the guards knew that Madam President needed the Falling Autumn Grass to stabilize her condition, so they did not dare to stop Annie.

The President’s blue eyes dimmed, and his thin lips pursed tightly. He knew that Qiao Nian’s medical skills were very good, but Qiao Nian didn’t say that she would definitely be able to treat Madam’s illness.

If Qiao Nian couldn’t treat Madam’s illness, wouldn’t he lose the Falling Autumn Grass because of Qiao Nian today? Then, wouldn’t he be in a losing position?

However, if Qiao Nian could treat Madam’s illness… But he was worried that Madam would lose the Falling Autumn Grass and after offending Qiao Nian, she would never recover…

The President’s frown deepened. For a moment, he didn’t know what to do.

Annie’s sharp eyes could tell that the president was hesitating. She knew in her heart that that stupid aunt was very important to the president. As long as she threatened the president with her aunt, the president would do anything.

A trace of a scheme flashed in her eyes. She raised her head slightly and said arrogantly, “Uncle, you should know what’s most important to you, right? Actually, my request isn’t too much. I just want this man to accompany me.”

With that, Annie looked at Gu Zhou with a burning gaze. She was determined to get this man.

Gu Zhou stood there coldly. From the beginning to the end, he did not even look at Annie.

The president’s frown deepened. He knew in his heart that Annie was forcing him into a corner. He coughed and cleared his throat. Just as he was about to speak, a clear female voice came from afar.

“Are you talking about the Falling Autumn Grass? The one I have here?”

Everyone looked over.

When the President saw who it was, his eyes lit up. His lips curved up imperceptibly.

The people who came over were none other than Qiao Nian and Lina. Moreover, the plant Qiao Nian was holding was the Falling Autumn Grass.

Qiao Nian held the flower pot in one hand. As she walked, the Falling Autumn Grass bloomed.

The President’s eyes lit up. He quickly walked over and carefully took the Falling Autumn Grass from Qiao Nian. He was so touched that his eyes turned red.

He heaved a sigh of relief and looked at Qiao Nian curiously. Puzzled, he asked, “Where did you find it?”

Lina knew that her mother’s illness had always required the Falling Autumn Grass to stabilize. She knew that Qiao Nian would definitely be humble, so she spoke first. “I was strolling in the garden with Nian Nian just now. When we reached a place, Nian Nian suddenly stopped. She dug up a pile of flowers and plants and took out the Falling Autumn Grass in the innermost area. I don’t know how Qiao Nian discovered it.”

From the corner of her eye, Lina glanced at Annie, who was drenched. Annie must have deliberately hidden the Falling Autumn Grass in a pile of flowers and plants.

The president glanced at Annie, who was not far away. Had Annie long thought of asking him for something, so she deliberately hid the Falling Autumn Grass?

However, what surprised the president was that Qiao Nian actually recognized the Falling Autumn Grass. It was really unbelievable.

The president looked at Qiao Nian curiously.

With a gentle smile on her face, Qiao Nian glanced at the Falling Autumn Grass in the president’s hand and said humbly, “I’ve always liked to cultivate. I know a little about all kinds of plants and flowers. Previously, I saw the Falling Autumn Grass. Later on, when I passed by the garden, I happened to see a leaf.”

The president looked at Qiao Nian with admiration. He knew in his heart that if Qiao Nian didn’t know the Falling Autumn Grass very well, she wouldn’t have been able to see it among the tens of thousands of leaves. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He looked down at the Falling Autumn Grass in his hand and recalled what Qiao Nian had said previously. He had a bold thought. That thought grew crazily like wild grass encountering spring rain.

Annie gritted her teeth in anger. Previously, she had deliberately hidden the Falling Autumn Grass in the bushes to gain some benefits.

One had to know that Falling Autumn Grass was very delicate and had very high requirements for the environment it grew in. If it was kept in the grass and not transplanted properly, it would wither like a short-lived epiphyllum.

She understood that the president would definitely agree to any request she made for the Falling Autumn Grass. That was why she had threatened the president fearlessly in front of everyone.

That woman simply didn’t know her limits. She actually dared to ruin her plans. She had to make that woman suffer to be unable to bear the consequences of failure.
