724 Let Her Try

Matriarch Lu looked at her eldest and second sons with a complicated expression. It had to be known that the two of them were usually extremely nervous when it came to matters related to Sugar, but she had never expected the two of them to agree to let Qiao Nian carve Sugar’s urn.

Matriarch Lu thought about it seriously. Her gaze landed on Lu Rao and she asked, “Third Brother, what do you think?”

When Song Yu heard Matriarch Lu’s words, she knew that Matriarch Lu had already relented. She glanced at Qiao Nian with a complicated expression. At this moment, Qiao Nian was looking at Lu Rao expectantly.

She stood there quietly. If she wasn’t wrong, Third Brother would probably agree.

She had a feeling. This was a woman’s intuition.

Third Brother was looking at Qiao Nian differently.

Song Yu was puzzled. She didn’t understand how Qiao Nian had made her three brothers bow down to her.

It had taken her more than twenty years but she couldn’t get her three brothers to dote on her. Qiao Nian had done it.

Lu Rao met Qiao Nian’s gaze, then looked at Matriarch Lu and nodded. “Grandma, I think Sister also hopes that her urn will look better. Since Miss Qiao has such skills, let her try!”

When Lu Rao finished speaking, he was a little surprised. He didn’t understand why he trusted Qiao Nian without any conditions.

He knew that Song Yu was right. Touching his sister’s urn was not a small matter. It would be bad if she violated some taboo. However, when he met Qiao Nian’s eyes, he couldn’t help but want to believe her.

Qiao Nian’s heart, which had been in her throat, instantly fell.

When Song Yu heard Lu Rao’s words, she lowered her gaze slightly. Her heart was as empty as duckweed. She had no home to return to and was drifting with the flow.

Seeing that her three grandchildren did not object, Matriarch Lu did not refute.

She sighed heavily. Her gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face and she said meaningfully, “QIao Nian, it’s been hard on you this time. Our Sugar has liked to dress up beautifully since she was young. She must also want her urn to look better.”

When Qiao Nian heard Matriarch Gu’s words, some images flashed across her mind. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

She could vaguely see herself running around in a pile of clothes. Then, she chose the most beautiful one and asked the servants to help her change into it.

The servant brought the carving knife over. Matriarch Lu looked at the cold light emitted by the carving knife and couldn’t help but gasp.

“Qiao Nian, Sugar has been afraid of pain since she was young. Be careful later. Don’t hurt her!” Matriarch Lu instructed worriedly.

Qiao Nian’s hand, which was holding the carving knife, paused for a moment. A strange emotion welled up in her heart.

When she was young, she was also afraid of pain. When she was by her grandfather’s side, he often asked her to learn all kinds of things. One of them was carving.

At that time, she often accidentally cut her hand. It was so painful that she cried, but her grandfather refused to let her stop. He even forced her to continue carving. He even told her that she had to have a skill so that she would not starve to death in the future.

Perhaps it was because it hurt too many times, but gradually, she no longer feared pain.

It was always hard to grow up alone, but if one grew up beside their family, they would be doted on endlessly.

If she had not been taken away back then, she might have been protected well like Lu Qi and grown up carefree.

Qiao Nian smiled at Matriarch Lu and said, “Don’t worry, I’ll definitely carve the urn perfectly. Moreover, I won’t hurt the eldest daughter of the Lu family.”

Lu Zhu and Lu Nian looked at Qiao Nian’s smile and felt a little sad.

Their sister was really too lovable.

Holding the carving knife, Qiao Nian walked to the urn and carefully scraped off the sulfuric acid.

Everyone watched as Qiao Nian carefully carved the urn. No one said anything.

Soon, more than two hours passed.

Qiao Nian engraved a large bouquet of hyacinths on the urn.

Everyone recalled the hyacinth blessing bag Qiao Nian had embroidered. If only the blessing bag hadn’t been ruined by Jiang Yue.
