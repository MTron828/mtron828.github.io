1259 Puzzled

Mr. Chen would never let off those who had bullied him. This time, when Gu Zhou tested Mr. Chen’s identity, Mr. Chen did not say anything on the surface, but he still contacted them behind their backs to ask them to leave.

This steel bullet belonged to Mr. Chen, which meant that this was definitely not fired by him. Even if Mr. Chen fired, he would never use his own special bullet. He would only use those ordinary bullets and not let anyone investigate the source.

“Perhaps Mr. Chen didn’t shoot. It might be someone close to him,” Qiao Nian said.

Gu Zhou nodded in agreement. “Yes.”

Previously, he had come to MY to look for his brother. Later on, someone discovered him and began to hunt him down.

He was now very sure that the person who had secretly helped him and Chen Qing in the dark must be Big Brother. Moreover, the people who had chased after him were all dead.

It seemed that the person who had helped Nian’er should be someone close to Mr. Chen.

Gu Zhou toyed with the steel bullet in his hand and said thoughtfully, “If I’m not wrong, there should be someone by his side who has his benevolence. That person has been by his side for so long, but he hasn’t learned to be ruthless. This can only mean that that person is a young man or a child.”

“It should be a young man! After all, it’s impossible for a child to have such good marksmanship!” Chen Qing paused for a moment and continued, “It should be a young man beside Eldest Young Master. That young man is very likely to have just followed Eldest Young Master and his hands have never been stained with blood.”

Gu Zhou did not speak. Even if it was a child, with Big Brother training him at the side, as long as the child was not a fool, he would be able to shoot well.

Gu Zhou looked up at Chen Qing and said, “There’s no need to continue investigating. Since this is someone close to Big Brother, book a ticket back to An City now.”

Chen Qing nodded. “Alright, I’ll buy a plane ticket now!”

With that, Chen Qing left tactfully.

Qiao Nian frowned and sat there in confusion. Puzzled, she said, “This doesn’t make sense.”

“Hm?”

“Think about it. If your brother wants to protect us, the person he sent out must be his trusted aide.” At this point, Qiao Nian paused for a moment. “You’ve also said that my Eldest Senior Brother has been by your brother’s side for many years. The person he trusts the most should be my Eldest Senior Brother. Back then, Eldest Senior Brother even sent Qiao Xin back to the country. At that time, your brother was worried that Qiao Xin would tell others about what happened to you in MY.”

Qiao Nian paused for a moment and continued, “From this, it can be seen that my Eldest Senior Brother is your brother’s most capable assistant.”

“You have a point, but he might send someone else,” Gu Zhou said. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Qiao Nian nodded and said, “I know, but no matter who he sends to protect me, that person must be his bodyguard, right? Since he’s a bodyguard, why would he let a child or a young man follow me? He even let that child hold a steel pistol?”

Gu Zhou nodded and said, “I understand what you mean, but we don’t have any other explanations now. For the sake of our safety, we should hurry back, lest we be targeted by those people.”

Qiao Nian was very curious about the person who had fired the shot.

Seeing Qiao Nian deep in thought, Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on her stomach. “You haven’t answered me.”

“What?” Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion.

Gu Zhou glanced at Qiao Nian’s stomach.

Qiao Nian recalled what she had discussed with Gu Zhou before Chen Qing arrived. She pursed her lips helplessly and said, “There’s no hurry in this matter. The most important thing for us now is to find our third child. Xiao Qi and Xiao Shi still need us to take good care of them.”

Without waiting for Gu Zhou to speak, Qiao Nian continued, “We still have to grow up with the children. What we have to do is…”

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian’s chattering mouth and moved it to his lips. Without hesitation, he sealed them.

It wasn’t until Qiao Nian was almost out of breath that Gu Zhou let go of her lips. He looked into Qiao Nian’s charming fox-like eyes and said softly, “This kind of thing is still up to fate.”

Before Qiao Nian could react, the bright lights in the room had already turned dim yellow…
