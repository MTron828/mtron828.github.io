Chapter 711: The Fragment Was Destroyed F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

At this moment, everyone walked out and surrounded Qiao Nian.

Jiang Yue gasped and said in disbelief, “Oh my god, Sister Nian Nian, how could you put sulfuric acid in the blessing bag? The sulfuric acid is so corrosive. Not only will it destroy the blessing bag, but it will also destroy the urn of the eldest daughter of the Lu family!”

At this moment, when Matriarch Lu heard Jiang Yue’s words, her expression changed slightly.

She believed that Qiao Nian was definitely not the culprit, but Jiang Yue’s words seemed to be telling everyone that Qiao Nian was the culprit.

Matriarch Lu frowned.

Everyone sighed and looked at Qiao Nian.

Gu Zhou frowned slightly, his cold gaze landing on Jiang Yue. His sharp gaze seemed to be able to see through Jiang Yue’s heart.

When Jiang Yue met Gu Zhou’s gaze, her face turned slightly pale. She hurriedly lowered her gaze and pretended to be innocent.

Qiao Nian sneered. Her expression was calm as she said fearlessly, “Sulfuric acid is so corrosive. If I had placed it in the blessing bag early on, it would have been corroded long ago. The urn wouldn’t have been spared either. Why would it have waited until today?”

When Matriarch Lu heard Qiao Nian’s words, she nodded in agreement. “You’re right. If sulfuric acid had been in the blessing bag long ago, I should have discovered the problem with theblessing bag long ago. The smell of sulfuric acid is so strong and the smell of flowers shouldn’t be able to hide it.”

Lu Zhu glanced at Jiang Yue thoughtfully, his voice bone-chilling. “I believe Qiao Nian didn’t do this. No one would use such a vicious method to destroy the blessing bag they had painstakingly embroidered, because the gains wouldn’t make up for the losses. Moreover, she has been under our noses the entire time and hasn’t done anything suspicious, so I believe she definitely didn’t do this!”

Lu Nian, who was standing beside Lu Zhu, said confidently, “I also believe that Qiao Nian definitely didn’t do this. There must be something more.”

Lu Qi nodded in agreement and said, “Sister Nian Nian definitely didn’t do it. I believe she would never do such a thing!”

At this moment, Song Yu’s eyes were filled with surprise. She hadn’t expected her two brothers to speak up for Qiao Nian.

How strange.

The two brothers treated Eldest Miss Lu’s urn as if it were alive. In the past, even if someone accidentally touched Eldest Miss Lu’s urn, the brothers would have chased that servant out.

What was wrong with them now?

Was it because of Qiao Nian’s words that they chose to believe her and not pursue her mistakes?

The more Song Yu thought about it, the more her head hurt. Although she didn’t know if Qiao Nian had done that, since Eldest Brother and Second Brother had already said so, she definitely couldn’t stand up and go against them.

In that case, Qiao Nian might really not have done this.

If Qiao Nian didn’t do it, then who did?

The eldest daughter of the Lu family passed away when she was three years old. Who would make things difficult for a child?

Just as Song Yu was feeling puzzled, Gu Zhou’s cold voice rang out.

“Jiang Yue, how can you be so sure that Qiao Nian was behind this? Or are you just trying to slander her and deliberately planned all of this?”

Everyone turned to look at Jiang Yue.

When Song Yu heard Gu Zhou’s words, her eyelids twitched slightly, and her heart instantly sank to the bottom.

Apart from the Lu family, Qiao Nian, Gu Zhou, and Jiang Yue were the only outsiders.

Since everyone felt that it was impossible for Qiao Nian to have done this, they took the initiative to eliminate her.

Of course, it was even more impossible for Brother Ah Zhou to do such a thing, because he had once been engaged to the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

Song Yu’s gaze landed on Jiang Yue’s face. The most suspicious person now was Jiang Yue.

After removing all the impossibilities, no matter how low the possibility was, it was very likely to be the truth.

Could it really be Jiang Yue? But why would Jiang Yue do such a thing?

Song Yu was puzzled.

At this moment, Jiang Yue’s face instantly turned pale, and a trace of panic flashed in her eyes.
