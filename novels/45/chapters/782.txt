783 Unfilial

There was probably no other more unfilial child in the world than him.

The smile on Xiao Shi’s face faded. She recalled what Auntie Nian Nian had said to her on the way to the Gu residence.

Auntie Nian Nian was a warm person. She felt very safe around Auntie Nian Nian.

Xiao Shi looked at the sad Brother Qi on the phone and said, “Brother, that’s not how this matter should be settled. The person who has been by your side encouraging you and taking care of you is Auntie Nian Nian Nian. It was an accident that the two of us met. If the two of us had never met and if we weren’t siblings, you would have never been able to find Mommy. Are you going to be a child without Mommy for the rest of your life? Wouldn’t that be too pitiful!”

Xiao Shi saw Gu Qi look up and continue, “When I was at home, I hoped that Brother Xiao Qi could live a happier life. I think Mommy thought so too!”

Gu Qi’s eyes were sparkling, and his heart was beating very fast. “Is that really what you think?”

“Of course. Previously, I even persuaded Mommy to find a new daddy!” Xiao Shi smiled brightly. She seemed to have thought of something and frowned, saying disapprovingly, “Brother Xiao Qi, if you have to throw Auntie Nian Nian away and forget about her just because you found Mommy now, wouldn’t that be a little too heartless? Previously, I heard from the teachers that this isn’t a good child. Good children can distinguish right from wrong. They can’t let their emotions affect them!”

When Gu Qi heard Xiao Shi’s words, the uneasiness in his heart gradually disappeared, and he felt much less guilty. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

His sister was right.

Before he found his mommy, he had already told his grandmother that he wanted Auntie Nian Nian to be his mommy.

One could not go back on their word.

Moreover, Auntie Nian Nian treated him so well.

One could not go back on their word.

“Okay! Goodnight, Sister. Goodbye!”

“Goodnight, Brother!”

Just as he hung up, there was a knock on the door.

Xiao Shi stuffed her phone under her pillow and tilted her head to look at the door. “Please come in!”

At this moment, the door opened.

Xiao Shi saw Auntie Nian Nian walking in wearing white pajamas.

Under the light, Auntie Nian Nian looked like an angel. Her skin was as white as snow, and for a moment, she was stunned.

However, Xiao Shi quickly reacted. She sat up and greeted Auntie Nian Nian obediently, “Hello, Auntie Nian Nian!”

With a gentle smile on her face, Qiao Nian walked to the bed and sat down. She helped Xiao Shi lie down and covered her with a blanket. Then, she crawled under Xiao Shi’s blanket herself, and the two of them lay side by side on the bed.

In the past, she had always slept alone. Now that Auntie Nian Nian was lying beside her, her heart couldn’t help but race.

She felt the entire blanket warm up, and she couldn’t help but sink into it.

Qiao Nian looked at Xiao Shi seriously and asked softly, “Xiao Shi, you’ve come to An City alone. Are you used to not sleeping with your mommy?”

Xiao Shi shook her head and said obediently, “Auntie Nian Nian, don’t worry about me. I won’t be affected by it. When I’m at home, I sleep by myself!”

The smile on Qiao Nian’s face froze. Puzzled, she asked, “Then when did you start sleeping alone?”

Xiao Shi pouted slightly and thought about it seriously before saying, “I’ve had memories since I was more than two years old. At that time, I slept alone!”

Hearing Xiao Shi’s words, Qiao Nian felt inexplicably uncomfortable. Puzzled, she asked, “Then why didn’t you sleep with your mommy?”

“Mommy is sick. The doctor said that Mommy seems to be mentally weak. A little movement will wake her up. If I sleep with Mommy, Mommy won’t be able to sleep!” Xiao Shi said like an adult. “Auntie Nian Nian, am I very brave? I’ve been able to sleep by myself since I was young!”

“Yes, Xiao Shi is really a brave child!” Qiao Nian praised with a smile.

However, her doubts grew.
