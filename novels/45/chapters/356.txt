Chapter 357: Aggrieved

Qiao Nian could now see who it was. Her beautiful fox-like eyes narrowed as she questioned coldly, “What are you doing?”

Qin Lu had never expected Qiao Nian to interrupt her flawless plan!

Qiao Nian had no intention of letting go. She gripped Qin Lu’s wrist tightly, causing so much pain that Qin Lu’s tears were about to fall.

Seeing that Qin Lu was silent, Qiao Nian continued questioning, “Just now, I hit you at the door. You weren’t convinced, so you wanted to hit me back when the lights were switched off?”

Qin Lu was speechless.

What kind of joke was this?

Her target was Gu Zhou.

She had no time to sneak up on Qiao Nian!

Just as Qin Lu was about to speak, she sensed Gu Zhou’s cold gaze. His gaze seemed to want to skin her alive.

Qin Lu trembled in fear. She stood rooted to the ground in fear, not daring to explain her intentions.

Qin Lu tried to retract her hand, but she couldn’t. She looked up at Qiao Nian and frowned. “Let go of me!”

Qiao Nian looked at Qin Lu warily and said, “If you don’t make yourself clear, I won’t let go of you. Otherwise, what if you’re planning to ambush me again the next time the lights are off?”

Qin Lu was speechless.

You must be thinking too much!

Who cares about ambushing you!

Don’t think so highly of yourself!

Pft!

“If you don’t tell me, then you can forget about getting your hands back!”

With that, Qiao Nian twisted Qin Lu’s hand.

Qin Lu was completely stunned. She knew that Qiao Nian was someone who would do whatever she said. She hurriedly said, “I really didn’t intend to ambush you. I just thought that your position might give me a better view, so I wanted to stand here!”

Qiao Nian stared at Qin Lu’s face seriously. Seeing that her expression was sincere and that she didn’t seem to be lying, she let go of Qin Lu’s hand unhappily.

It wasn’t easy for Qin Lu to regain her freedom. Breathing heavily, she gently rubbed her wrist, which was hurting from Qiao Nian’s grip. In her heart, she had long cursed Qiao Nian’s ancestors.

So violent.

This was simply an insult to refinement!

She didn’t need to think to know that Gu Zhou wouldn’t like such a violent person.

Qin Lu felt both aggrieved and sad. It hadn’t been easy for her to find an opportunity to get close to Gu Zhou, but she hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to interrupt everything.

Qiao Nian was here to ruin her plans!

Suddenly, Gu Zhou smelled a pungent fragrance. He frowned. He turned his head and saw Qin Lu’s face, which made him angry.

Gu Zhou pursed his lips and said coldly, “Get lost!”

Tears welled up in Qin Lu’s eyes.

She had never been so humiliated, nor so aggrieved. She was about to die of anger.

Fortunately, most people were focused on the first treasure to be auctioned. No one noticed that she had made a fool of herself. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

At this moment, the host on stage introduced the first treasure. “This is a Night-Luminescent Pearl we obtained from the ancient city of Lou Lan. Not only can it illuminate at night, but it can also be used for skincare. It exudes a special fragrance. This fragrance is good for sleeping.”

Everyone saw that the night pearl was emitting a gentle light, like moonlight in the night.

With that, the lights in the banquet hall turned on.

Only then did Qiao Nian’s gaze fall on the huge night pearl. Her lips curved up slightly. This was her secret treasure.

Many people present were tempted, but this price was too high, so no one dared to speak.

“Fifty-one million.”

A gentle and elegant male voice came from the crowd.

Everyone looked over.

So it was Li Kun who had bid.

Qin Dong, who was standing at the side, was slightly stunned. This was the first time she had seen Li Kun act so rashly.

Jiang Yue was also stunned.

Qin Lu pursed her lips and said carefully, “Cousin, what if there’s something better?”

Li Kun’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. Seeing the joy on her face, he said disapprovingly, “As long as she likes it!”
