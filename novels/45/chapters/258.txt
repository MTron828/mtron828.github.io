Chapter 259: The Gu Family?

At this moment, the butler got out of the car and opened the door.

Qiao Nian got into the car and called Wang Xuan over.

Wang Xuan got into the car calmly. She wasn’t surprised at all. With Qiao Nian’s aura and the violin in her hand, she had felt from the beginning that Qiao Nian didn’t look like the country bumpkin she was described to be.

The car drove straight towards the Gu residence.

Initially, Wang Xuan had thought that Qiao Nian’s house was next to hers. However, when the car entered the Gu family’s territory, Wang Xuan could no longer sit still. She turned to look at Qiao Nian and asked uncertainly, “Nian Nian, have we reached the Gu family’s territory?”

Qiao Nian nodded slightly. “Yes.”

Wang Xuan looked at Qiao Nian in surprise and asked in confusion, “I heard from others that if you’re not a member of the Gu family, you’re not allowed to visit the Gu family. Are you the precious daughter of the Gu family?”

However, Wang Xuan quickly denied her words. “That’s not right either. I heard from others that Jiangyue and Zhaoqian are the daughters of the Gu family.”

The butler, who was sitting in front, saw Wang Xuan’s puzzled expression and said with a smile, “Miss Wang Xuan can be considered the precious daughter of the Gu family!”

Of course, Qiao Nian was more precious than a thousand pieces of gold.

Wang Xuan was a little confused. After thinking for a long time, she said, “Are you the daughter of the butler? I heard that Old Madam Gu is a very good person. She especially likes to take care of children. Matriarch Gu treats you like her own granddaughter. That’s why I said that you’re the precious daughter of the Gu family!”

When Butler Ye, who was sitting in front, heard Wang Xuan’s words, he couldn’t help but cough twice. “Miss Wang Xuan, don’t tease me. My surname is Ye.”

After some thought, Wang Xuan still couldn’t guess Qiao Nian’s identity. She couldn’t be bothered to guess anymore.

Qiao Nian was very curious. What exactly was the distinguished guest Grandma was referring to?

Although she had not been married into the Gu family for long, many people visited her. Grandma knew that she did not like such occasions and had never asked her to attend any events.

However, what kind of distinguished guest was this? Grandma had specially called her back from school.

She even said that this distinguished guest was the person she wanted to see the most.

Right now, the people she wanted to see the most were Mr. Dong Hua and her family, but it seemed impossible for either of them.

Qiao Nian thought for a long time, but still couldn’t guess who the esteemed guest was. She had no choice but to ask Butler Ye.

“Butler Ye, did someone come to the house today?”

“Yes, yes. He’s Second Young Master’s old friend, and the person you want to see the most.”

When Qiao Nian heard Butler Ye’s words, she knew that he wouldn’t reveal any information about the guest.

However, she was curious as to why she would want to meet Gu Zhou’s friend.

Soon, the car stopped steadily at the entrance of the Gu family villa.

When Qiao Nian stepped into the villa, the servants who were working instantly stopped. They faced Qiao Nian, nodded slightly, and greeted respectfully, “Madam!”

Wang Xuan, who was standing beside Qiao Nian, was instantly stunned when she heard the servant’s words. Her eyes widened to the size of saucers as she looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief. Puzzled, she asked, “Madam?”

Along the way, Qiao Nian had been wondering who the esteemed guest was. She had completely forgotten to introduce herself.

Now that she heard Wang Xuan’s words, she looked apologetic. She should have explained her identity to Wang Xuan before she came. “Actually, I…”

“Nian Nian!” Matriarch Gu walked out of the villa happily. Her words accidentally interrupted Qiao Nian. She walked up to Qiao Nian and took her hand. She glanced at Wang Xuan and smiled lovingly. “What’s your friend’s name?”

Qiao Nian hurriedly introduced Wang Xuan to Matriarch Gu. “Grandma, her name is Wang Xuan. She’s my best friend in school!”

A polite smile appeared on Wang Xuan’s face. “Hello, Matriarch Gu. Sorry for disturbing you today!”

Wang Xuan could tell that Matriarch Gu had an elegant and poised aura. She had a loving smile on her face, but her dignity could not be ignored.
