775 Teaching His Son

When she was young, she thought to herself that it was fortunate that her brother had brought her a pair of gloves. That way, she wouldn’t have to worry about her father discovering that she wasn’t Brother Xiao Qi because of her hands.

When they arrived at Xiao Shi’s room, Gu Zhou sensed the phone in his pocket vibrate. He turned to Xiao Shi and said, “Find the textbook first.”

Xiao Shi’s lips curved up slightly. She couldn’t wait to open her brother’s school bag.

She was carrying her brother’s school bag home with her today.

In the past, when she was in Hai Cheng, she would fantasize about carrying a brand new school bag every day. Now, her wish had finally come true.

Gu Zhou took out his phone and saw a message from Chen Qing.

“Second Young Master, we’re going to discuss that piece of land this afternoon. The Land Bureau seems to have taken a liking to Qiao Yu’s proposal. If we want to fight for this piece of land, we have to discuss it with the Land Bureau today. Otherwise, that piece of land might fall into Qiao Yu’s hands.”

When Gu Zhou saw this, his frown deepened.

He recalled the way Qiao Yu had looked at Qiao Nian. That gaze made him feel very uncomfortable.

The Qiao family had done so much to Qiao Nian.

If he wanted to attack the Qiao family, he had to start attacking Qiao Yu, because Qiao Yu was now the entire hope of the Qiao family.

Ever since he returned from MY, he had been looking for people to discuss it with the Land Bureau.

Moreover, he had already offered very good conditions, but the people from the Land Bureau were still optimistic about another company.

Although that piece of land was very important, he felt that accompanying his son was the most important thing now.

Sometimes, it had to be fated. If there was no time in life, one should not force it.

He would leave that piece of land to fate. Most of the reason why he wanted to get this piece of land was because he wanted to make Qiao Yu unhappy.

“Go and follow up. Just tell me the results later!” With that, Gu Zhou turned off his phone.

When Xiao Shi took out her math book , shestared at her father.

His father seemed to be frowning. He seemed to have something very important to do.

Xiao Zheng lowered his head slightly and asked carefully, “Daddy, are you busy?”

When Gu Zhou heard Gu Qi’s words, his gaze fell on his face and he said, “The most important thing for me now is to study with you!”

Xiao Shi looked at Gu Zhou excitedly. She couldn’t help but throw herself into Gu Zhou’s arms. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Daddy!”

This was the first time Gu Zhou had seen Gu Qi so enthusiastic about him. He reached out and hugged Gu Qi. After a moment’s hesitation, he gently patted Gu Qi’s back.

…

At this moment, Qiao Nian, who was standing in the living room downstairs, looked worriedly at the stairs on the second floor.

Matriarch Gu stood beside Qiao Nian. Seeing Qiao Nian’s worried expression, she asked with concern, “Nian Nian, did something happen?”

Qiao Nian came back to her senses and shook her head with a smile. “No, I just think Xiao Qi is much happier than before. I hope he can be like this in the future.”

When Matriarch Gu heard Qiao Nian’s words, she was touched. She grabbed Qiao Nian’s hand and said, “Good child, I have something to discuss with you!”

“Yeah.”

Holding Qiao Nian’s hand, Matriarch Gu walked towards the sofa and sat down with her.

Back then, when Matriarch Gu first saw Qiao Nian, she had felt that Qiao Nian would be their Ah Zhou’s lucky star.

Matriarch Gu did not go straight to the point. Instead, she smiled and said, “I think you especially like Xiao Qi. The two of you get along quite well!”

When Qiao Nian heard Matriarch Gu’s words, her eyes were filled with laughter. “Xiao Qi is an obedient and sensible child!”

When Matriarch Gu heard Qiao Nian’s words, she heaved a sigh of relief.

Since Qiao Nian liked Gu Qi, she could speak the rest.

“During this period of time, I’ve been thinking about whether to interfere in the matter between you and Ah Zhou. Then, the matter between the two of you should be resolved by yourselves. However, I think there are some things you need to know!”

Qiao Nian sat up straight, her expression turning serious. She said seriously, “Grandma, if you have anything to say, just say it!”
