Chapter 1812 - 1812 Old Qin

Qin Chuan’s eyes gradually softened. His eyes were filled with light as he called out in disbelief, “Eldest Senior Brother.”

Just as Qin Chuan was about to say something, he saw two people walk in.

Qiao Nian helped Old Master Qin in from outside and smiled at Qin Chuan. Just as she was about to ask if Qin Chuan still knew his grandfather, she saw Qin Chuan’s eyes light up the entire room.

Could it be that Qin Chuan had thought of his grandfather?

The next moment, Qiao Nian saw Qin Chuan sitting rooted to the ground in a daze.

Qiao Nian walked to Qin Chuan’s side and patted his shoulder gently. She asked with concern, “Old Qin, can you still…”

Qin Chuan’s eyes turned redder and redder as he choked, “Grandpa!”

Qiao Nian quickly asked, “How much of your memory have you recovered?”

As he spoke, Qin Chuan was about to get out of bed.

Old Master Qin immediately glared at him and said with disdain, “You’re still sick. Rest well on the bed and don’t move around.”

Qin Chuan sat on the spot without moving. His voice was a little choked. “Grandpa, where are you going? Why couldn’t Nian Nian and I find you? Even if you had something to do and went out, you should have told us. You didn’t know but we thought…”

He did not want to say the rest of the unlucky words.

At one point, he thought that he only had Nian’er left.

Fortunately, Grandpa was still fine.

Old Master Qin walked to Qin Chuan’s side and sat by the bed to take his pulse. His eyes were red as he said with a moved expression, “I’m fine, but our circumstances were special. I was afraid that contacting you would affect your lives. You’ve done well all these years. It’s been hard on you.”

Qin Chuan shook his head and resisted the urge to cry. “It’s not hard at all.”

He looked up at Chang Feng and said, “Eldest Senior Brother, it’s been hard on you all these years.”

Chang Feng shook his head with a smile and did not say anything.

Qiao Nian walked to the coffee table at the side and was about to make tea with the teapot when Chang Feng blocked her way.

“I’ll make tea. Sit down and rest.” As he spoke, Chang Feng was about to take the teapot from her hand.

Qiao Nian turned slightly and avoided Chang Feng’s hand. She smiled and said, “Eldest Senior Brother, I’ve already grown up. I can do these things.”

Chang Feng looked at Qiao Nian in front of him. Qiao Nian was a little taller than before. She was less lively but more gentle than before.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

In the blink of an eye, Little Junior Sister had grown up.

For so many years, he had not been able to take good care of his junior sister.

When he thought of how her junior sister had been humiliated in the Qiao family, he lowered his eyes sadly.

“Alright, thank you, Little Junior Sister. You’ve really grown up a lot now,” Chang Feng said emotionally.

“Yes, what flavor of tea does Eldest Senior Brother like?”

“Anything is fine.”

When Chang Feng brushed past Qiao Nian, he couldn’t help but say, “Little Junior Sister, no matter how old you are, you’ll always be my little junior sister.”

When Qiao Nian heard Chang Feng’s words, she looked up at him and nodded with red eyes. “Yes.”

Eldest Senior Brother told her that in front of her family, she did not have to be obedient and sensible. She just had to live freely.

Qiao Nian took the teapot and went out to make tea. There were a lot of tea leaves in the hospital pantry. When she returned to the ward with the tea, she saw Qin Chuan smiling and talking about what had happened recently.

After Qiao Nian walked in, she handed the tea to her grandfather, then to Eldest Senior Brother. Finally, she handed a cup to Qin Chuan.

She narrowed her eyes slightly and looked at Qin Chuan seriously.

If she remembered correctly, shouldn’t Old Qin tell Grandpa about Lu Qi?
Qin Chuan naturally understood Qiao Nian’s gaze. His expression was calm as he gestured for Qiao Nian not to be anxious.

Chang Feng’s sharp eyes noticed that Qiao Nian and Qin Chuan were talking in riddles. He asked bluntly, “Are the two of you hiding something from us?”

When Old Master Qin heard Qin Chuan’s words, he looked at him sharply.

Qin Chuan’s phone vibrated slightly. He glanced at the message.

Lu Qi: I’ll be right there!
