She pulled Chen Qing hard, worried that Chen Qing would be killed by Mark if he rushed in.

At this moment, Lin Mian rushed over with the army and brought the two of them back.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

On the second floor of the castle.

Lina stood by the window and looked at the armed guards who had barged in. Her expression was calm and cold. “What do you want?”

The guards only stood far away and did not approach Lina directly. Instead, they stayed a safe distance from Lina.

Actually, Lina could jump down now, but she had already been seen by those guards. Even if she jumped down, those people would find her and catch her.

Under such circumstances, it did not matter if she jumped down or not. Anyway, those people would definitely create an issue with her.

Lina saw that the guards were all silent. Her brows were tightly furrowed, and her eyes were filled with vigilance. She knew that the guards were all waiting for Mark.

At this moment, footsteps came from outside the door. The footsteps were steady and powerful, and every step seemed to carry a heavy pressure.

When Mark appeared at the door of the room, the guards automatically divided into two rows to make way.

Mark walked up to Lina expressionlessly. His entire body exuded a powerful aura. It was as he could fight an army by himself.

He looked at Lina domineeringly.

Lina noticed Mark’s gaze and her heart instantly rose to her throat in nervousness. The image of Mark pulling out his sister’s oxygen mask flashed before her eyes.

She suddenly could not breathe. She covered her chest with one hand and was in unbearable pain.

Mark motioned to the guard beside him to turn on the lights.

The room lit up instantly. Lina subconsciously narrowed her eyes and tilted her head to look out of the window.

Mark glanced at the corpse on the ground and his gaze finally landed on the knife on the corpse’s chest. Then, he looked at Lina in front of him and said coldly, “Lina, you actually killed someone. Even if you’re a princess, you’re guilty of the same crime as the common people. You should set an example for the entire Europe.”

Lina took a deep breath and finally recovered, but she still did not dare to look at Mark.

Lina kept hypnotizing herself. Mark did not dare to attack her now. She could only bluff her way out.

Moreover, Nian Nian and her father were all outside. They would definitely think of a way to save her.

Thinking of this, Lina calmed down a lot.

Lina looked up at Mark in front of her and smiled politely. “I did barge into your room without saying goodbye. Is that illegal? Logically speaking, this should only be rude!”

Mark looked at Lina with a fake smile, his entire face looking a little ferocious.

“You broke into my room in the middle of the night and killed someone in my room. You’re a murderer!”

At this point, Mark gave the guard beside him a look.

The guard walked forward with good eyesight and was about to drag Lina out when Mark’s gaze landed on Lina’s hand. His eyes rolled and he said, “Your fingerprints are all on the dagger. Do you think you can escape?”

When the guard heard Mark’s words, he immediately pressed Lina down and forced her to put her hand on the dagger.

Lina was picked up by the guards again. She looked up at Mark, who was not far away, and suddenly felt that Mark was not scary at all, because Mark’s despicable appearance was exactly the same as Wright’s.

Lina chuckled and said, “I originally thought that Wright was already the most despicable person in the world, but I didn’t expect you to be even more despicable than him. That’s right. Wright learned his despicable ways from you.”

When Mark heard Lina’s words, his expression was calm. “You’re just talking nonsense. I wonder if your father can protect you.”

The image of Mark removing his sister’s oxygen mask flashed across Lina’s eyes again. Hatred burst out of her eyes. She said word by word, “What you obtained through despicable means will be taken away by others one day.”

Lina believed that her father would definitely take everything he had lost from Mark.

Mark’s eyes flashed with surprise as he listened to Lina.
