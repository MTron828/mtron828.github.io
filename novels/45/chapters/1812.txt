Chapter 1813 - 1813 Fiancee

Hearing Qin Chuan’s words, Qiao Nian walked to the side and sat down.

At this moment, the door of the ward opened.

A little girl in a tracksuit walked in from outside and walked straight to Qin Chuan’s bed. She said, “Senior, this is a tonic soup I specially made. I heard that it’s especially effective. You have to drink it while it’s hot.”

The girl placed the lunch box on the bedside table, then opened it, filled a bowl with soup, and walked to the bed.

At this moment, she realized that there was no one on the bed.

Huh?

Where was Senior?

Lu Qi placed the soup on the bedside table and took out her phone to call Qin Chuan.

When Lu Qi came in, Qin Chuan’s gaze was already locked on her. She was like a harmless little rabbit that was extremely cute.

Qin Chuan’s phone rang. Lu Qi turned his head and saw Qin Chuan sitting on the sofa. Beside him was his sister, and on the other side were two strangers.

She smiled politely at the two strangers. Then, her gaze landed on Qiao Nian’s face and she asked softly, “Sister, when did you come back? By the way, how are things?”

“Yes, it’s all settled,” Qiao Nian said with a smile.

“Those two gentlemen are…” Lu Qi asked hesitantly.

Qiao Nian smiled and pulled Lu Qi to sit beside her. She gently stroked her hair and was about to introduce her when Qin Chuan said, “Let me introduce you.”

Qiao Nian looked at Qin Chuan with a faint smile. That was right. Only Qin Chuan could do the introduction now. After all, it was all Qin Chuan’s fault.

“Qiqi, this is my grandfather,” Qin Chuan said seriously. “He’s also my master.”

Lu Qi’s eyes lit up.

Wasn’t Qin Chuan’s grandfather the Miracle Doctor, Old Master Qin?

Old Master Qin had contributed a lot to the medical world. Many of his case prescriptions were recorded in medical textbooks.

All the students in the medical world wanted to acknowledge Old Master Qin as their master.

Lu Qi hurriedly stood up and bowed to Old Master Qin. “Hello, Master!”

Old Master Qin was slightly stunned. He looked at Lu Qi in front of him, then at Qiao Nian beside him. These two children really looked alike.

“This is Eldest Senior Brother.”

Lu Qi hurriedly bowed. “Hello, Eldest Senior Brother!”

Lu Qi was so excited and she was a little nervous.

Seeing Lu Qi’s nervousness, Qiao Nian smiled and said, “Qiqi, don’t be nervous. They’re all my family and yours too.”

Lu Qi nodded slightly.

Old Master Qin was still wondering why Lu Qi called him “Master” when he suddenly heard Qin Chuan’s voice.

“Grandpa, she’s Lu Qi, my fiancée, and the last disciple I took in for you!” Qin Chuan looked at Lu Qi beside him with a gentle gaze and said seriously.

Everyone was stunned.

Qiao Nian had noticed Qin Chuan’s feelings for Lu Qi previously. She did not expect him to directly say that Lu Qi was his fiancée. She raised her eyebrows slightly. “Old Qin, did you say that Lu Qi was the last disciple you took in for Grandpa?”

Old Master Qin and Chang Feng’s gazes landed on Qin Chuan’s face.

Only then did Old Master Qin realize why Lu Qi had called him “Master” previously.

Qin Chuan’s expression was calm as he nodded. “Grandpa, you’ll have a granddaughter-in-law soon. Are you very happy?”

When Qiao Nian heard Qin Chuan’s words, she felt that her head was spinning. Qin Chuan was really making things more exciting.
During the time she left An City, she did not have time to contact her family, let alone know how Qin Chuan and Lu Qi’s relationship had developed.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Lu Qi, who was called Qin Chuan’s fiancée, was also confused. She looked at Qin Chuan in surprise.

“Qiqi,” Qiao Nian called out in a low voice.

Lu Qi turned to look at Qiao Nian, his eyes filled with confusion. “Um, Sister, I…”

Qiao Nian looked at Lu Qi and stared at her face seriously. She asked, “Are the two of you engaged?”

Lu Qi’s heart was beating violently, and her eyes were filled with confusion. “This matter is a little complicated. It’s not that we’re engaged. I accidentally heard the assistant ask the nurse about his condition previously.”

“You think he won’t remember anything in the future, so you married him?” Qiao Nian looked at Lu Qi and asked seriously.
