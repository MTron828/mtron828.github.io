Chapter 66: Playing Hard to Get

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Su Yan was momentarily stunned. Previously, he had thought that Qiao Nian was playing hard to get, but now her attitude puzzled him.

“Then let’s talk here.” Su Yan stuffed a hand in his pocket and glanced at Qiao Nian calmly.

“Sure.”

Su Yan looked up at Qiao Nian and said impassively, “You’re already the principal of An University. Why didn’t you let Li Chun and Shen Yue off? Where did you take them?”

Qiao Nian crossed her arms and glanced at Su Yan coldly. Her face was expressionless. “Student Su, I don’t know what you’re talking about. I’m searching for them too. If you manage to find them, you can let me know.”

Su Yan frowned. “I heard that back then, you targeted them because of me?” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Is that so? Why didn’t I know that?” Qiao Nian raised her eyebrow, smiling.

“You’ve won so many awards in the past. You’re a smart person. Don’t you understand that by using such methods to hurt your love rivals, you’ll only push me further and further away?” As Su Yan spoke, he pictured Shen Yue confessing her love to him. He would take the opportunity to agree.

Qiao Nian gave a small laugh.

Seeing Qiao Nian laugh, Su Yan thought that she was too embarrassed to confess her feelings to him. He said, “I’ve already understood your intentions now. If you can be a little more gentle in the future, I think I can consider taking you as my girlfriend.”

Qiao Nian was so angry that she couldn’t help but laugh. She didn’t know how Su Yan had got the nerve to say this. With a trace of mockery in her eyes, she spoke. “Su Yan, did you graduate from the film academy? How can you fabricate such nonsense? You can become a film director with the fictional things you’re spouting!”

Su Yan glanced at Qiao Nian in confusion, freezing for a moment. “What?”

“I’m sorry, I’ve never liked you.” With that, Qiao Nian turned to leave.

Qiao Nian’s words were like a bolt from the blue, causing Su Yan to be stunned. He couldn’t believe his ears and immediately walked up to Qiao Nian, looking flustered. “Didn’t everyone in school say that you liked me?”

“Did I say that myself?” Qiao Nian glanced at Su Yan impatiently.

Su Yan was momentarily stunned. It did indeed seem that Qiao Nian had never confessed her feelings to him directly. “If you don’t like me, how can there be so many rumors?”

When Qiao Nian heard Su Yan’s words, the corners of her lips turned up. Casually, she replied, “I thought you liked me and were embarrassed to confess your love for me. That’s why you spread those rumors.”

“I didn’t.” Su Yan frowned.

“Then I don’t know who started the rumors, but the funniest thing is that they said I killed someone and that I liked you. I wonder who’s filling your ears with all this gossip?” Ignoring Su Yan, who was now in shock, Qiao Nian left.

As for Su Yan, he was dumbfounded. Qiao Nian had indeed said nothing directly to him, and there was no concrete evidence.

Had he been imagining things all these years?

Something was wrong.

It seemed that it was Qiao Xin who told him.

Qiao Xin had said that Qiao Nian liked him.

Qiao Xin also said that Qiao Nian had gone around claiming that she liked him.

Qiao Xin also said that Qiao Nian had killed someone for him.

Su Yan’s mind was in a mess. He couldn’t believe that Qiao Xin was the one who had told him all this gossip. In his heart, Qiao Xin was the purest and kindest person on earth.

Su Yan thought for a moment and ran over to Qiao Nian. His expression was dark as he said, “You’re lying!”

Qiao Nian was practically speechless.. “Alright, if you want to think that every girl likes you, so be it. You’re deluding yourself! I don’t want to be your girlfriend!”
