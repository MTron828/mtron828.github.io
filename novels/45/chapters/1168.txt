1169 Nightmare

Qiao Nian hugged Gu Zhou tightly. Thinking of the situation in her dream, she said in a low voice, “I just dreamed that in order to save me, Mr. Chen blocked a bullet for me. He even detonated a bomb, killing the entire church and the people chasing after me. I saw him die in front of me. I…”

Thank you readers!

Qiao Nian’s voice choked up.

Even though she knew that everything just now was just a dream, she was still so sad that she wanted to cry.

Gu Zhou hugged Qiao Nian tightly and asked in a low voice, “Do you know him?”

Qiao Nian composed herself and looked up at Gu Zhou. She shook her head gently and said, “Actually, I’m not familiar with him. Previously, I went to MY to participate in a stone gambling competition. At that time, I met Mr. Chen a few times.”

She was not familiar with Mr. Chen. If it weren’t for Ah Miao, she might not have noticed him.

Listening to Qiao Nian’s dream, Gu Zhou gently patted her back and said gently, “When people sleep, their brains are also resting. Only then will they have some strange dreams.”

“Yes.” Qiao Nian nodded in agreement. Perhaps it was because she had reunited with her parents today that she had dreamed that Mr. Chen would die for her.

However, the heartache in her dream was too real, like reality. Even if she woke up now, she felt as if what had happened in her dream had really happened.

“Actually, dreams are the opposite. Mr. Chen definitely won’t die. His body must be especially healthy.”

Qiao Nian nodded, but she was still thinking about her dream.

Before long, there was a knock on the door, followed by the butler’s voice.

“Fifth Miss, Young Master, it’s getting late. It’s time to get up.”

When Qiao Nian heard the butler’s words, she instantly sobered up.

Oh no.

Now, everyone knew that she had secretly run to Gu Zhou’s room last night.

Qiao Nian’s face turned red.

“Auntie Dong, I’m already up. I’ll go down now,” Qiao Nian replied.

“Alright, Fifth Miss. I’ll leave your clothes at the door.” With that, Auntie Dong left.

“Thank you, Auntie Dong.” With that, Qiao Nian glanced at the man who was still hugging her. She pushed him and said in a low voice, “Get up quickly!”

“Okay.” Smiling, Gu Zhou let go of Qiao Nian’s waist.

Seeing that Gu Zhou was still lazing around in bed, Qiao Nian couldn’t be bothered with him. She got out of bed and walked to the door. She realized that Auntie Dong had prepared a new set of clothes for her. The clothes were hanging on the mobile hanger, so she brought them in.

Gu Zhou lay lazily on the bed, thinking about the dream Qiao Nian had just told him. He frowned slightly. He didn’t like it when she dreamed of another man.

After Qiao Nian entered the bathroom, she saw that Gu Zhou hadn’t entered. She poked her head out of the bathroom and saw Gu Zhou sitting on the bed with a serious expression, as if he was thinking about something.

Qiao Nian smiled and asked, “Are you coming?”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, his eyes lit up. His lips curled up slightly as he slowly walked towards the bathroom.

How could he refuse his wife’s invitation?

…

About twenty minutes later, Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian walked downstairs together.

When Gu Zhou walked to the living room, he instantly received many unfriendly gazes.

He looked around and realized that his father-in-law’s gaze was the most terrifying!

Gu Zhou was speechless.

When Qiao Nian walked downstairs, her eyes lit up when she saw that the Lu family was all in the living room. She quickly walked over to Su Yan and Lu You. She took Su Yan’s arm, and called out, “Dad, Mom!”

When Lu You looked at Qiao Nian, his eyes were gentle and filled with love.

Su Yan said gently, “Let’s go for breakfast. After breakfast, I’ll take you to the hospital. Your father will go to the police station.”

Qiao Nian smiled and nodded.

The Lu family’s breakfast was also very sumptuous, but Qiao Nian was a little tired from eating.

Grandma, Dad, and Mom took turns picking up food for her. She didn’t eat much in the morning, but her family’s love forced her to eat too much. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

After eating, Lu You said with a low expression, “I’ll go to the police station to get information on Sugar’s kidnapping twenty years ago. Then, I’ll go to the hospital to look for you.”
