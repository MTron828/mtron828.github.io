Chapter 542: How Have You Been?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

When Qiao Nian saw Ah Rao approaching, she recalled how she and Ah Rao had interacted when they were at MY. Her heart skipped a beat, and she pursed her lips.

When Ah Rao walked up to her, she almost called him “Third Brother”.

Qiao Nian panicked.

If she really called him that, then her plan with Big Brother would be completely ruined. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

That mastermind might still be hiding in the dark to kill her.

She couldn’t get so excited. She had to calm down.

Ah Rao’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face, his eyes sparkling. His sexy lips curved up slightly. “Miss Qiao, I’m glad to see you again!”

His voice was deep and rich, carrying a low rumble.

Qiao Nian stared unblinkingly at Ah Rao, a trace of emotion flashing in her eyes.

To be honest, if she weren’t Ah Rao’s sister and if she were still single, she might have fallen for him. He was really too good at flirting!

Qiao Nian’s heart warmed, and she felt a sense of pride.

Such an outstanding person was her brother.

Qiao Nian’s red lips curved up slightly. Her smile was as bright as fire, and her voice was delicate. “Ah Rao, how have you been?”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Gu Zhou and Lu Zhu’s expressions instantly turned serious. They looked at Ah Rao warily.

Right now, Ah Rao didn’t know about the relationship between Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou. He looked at Qiao Nian intently and asked, “Shall I send you home now?”

Qiao Nian stood between Gu Zhou and Lu Zhu. She could feel the coldness emanating from the two men beside her. She smiled gently and shook her head. “You should send Mr. Lu home first. He needs more rest now. I’ll go back with Gu Zhou.”

When Ah Rao heard Qiao Nian’s words, the smile on his face didn’t change, but he noticed the details of Qiao Nian’s words.

Qiao Nian addressed her brother as Mr. Lu.

But when Qiao Nian addressed Brother Ah Zhou, she addressed him by his full name.

Moreover, when he was in MY, it was Brother Ah Zhou who had asked him to protect her.

He still remembered when he had jokingly asked Big Brother if he could woo Qiao Nian. At that time, Big Brother had firmly said that he couldn’t. Now, it seemed that Qiao Nian and Brother Ah Zhou had an extraordinary relationship.

“Alright.” Ah Rao nodded, then said, “But I’ve already arranged a driver for you!”

Qiao Nian smiled and said, “Thank you!”

Ah Rao glanced at Qiao Nian, then walked over to Lu Zhu. He reached out to support Lu Zhu and waved his hand coolly. “Let’s go!”

Qiao Nian looked at her two brothers. Their blood was the same. She was a little moved. She opened her mouth slightly, as if she wanted to say something, but she had no choice but to swallow her words. In the end, she only smiled faintly. “Goodbye!”

Qiao Nian watched as they left. Her heart felt empty. Although she had already reunited with her brother, she had yet to regain her identity. She couldn’t return to the Lu family.

As long as she didn’t return to the Lu family for a day, she would feel like a child without a home. She would drift around in this world uneasily.

At this moment, one of Ah Rao’s subordinates, Chen Jun, walked over. His gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face, and he nodded slightly and said respectfully, “Let me send Mr. Gu and Miss Qiao home!”

Chen Qing’s gaze fell on Chen Jun’s face. He was shocked by Chen Jun’s overwhelming aura. He felt as if his job was about to be snatched away.

Chen Qing hurriedly said, “Actually, I…”

He had also called for a car.

But before Chen Qing could finish speaking, Qiao Nian interrupted him. “Let’s go!”

She didn’t want to waste Third Brother’s good intentions.

Even though Ah Rao didn’t know about their relationship yet.
