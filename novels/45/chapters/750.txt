751 Confession

Gu Zhou’s breathing was a little erratic. His hot breath circulated around Qiao Nian’s neck, and her body tensed up involuntarily. She couldn’t take it anymore and said, “Gu Zhou, why don’t you…”

“Nian’er…”

Gu Zhou interrupted Qiao Nian again. Just as Qiao Nian was looking at him in surprise, he said, “I think I’ve really fallen for you.”

His voice was low and hoarse, with a hint of haziness. He was like a flower in the moonlight, so beautiful that no one dared to touch him.

Qiao Nian was stunned. She had never expected Gu Zhou to say such a thing. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Gu Zhou had actually confessed to her?

This…

How was this possible?

Just as Qiao Nian was feeling puzzled, she inadvertently met Gu Zhou’s dark eyes.

They were very close. She could clearly see every eyelash of Gu Zhou’s, and she could feel his breath.

Gu Zhou’s gaze gradually moved down, finally landing on Qiao Nian’s slightly swollen lips.

At the thought of the kiss just now, Gu Zhou’s eyes darkened. He said again, “I’m serious.”

Qiao Nian looked shocked.

“You’ll always be Mrs. Gu. No one in this world can threaten your status. Even Xiao Qi’s biological mother can’t threaten your status.” Gu Zhou enunciated each word clearly.

Qiao Nian’s heart was beating wildly, as if it would jump out of her chest in the next moment. She looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief.

After a long while, Qiao Nian tried hard to calm herself down and asked, “Are… are you confessing your love for me?”

Gu Zhou narrowed his phoenix-like eyes, which seemed to contain a sea of stars. He asked, “Was I not obvious enough?”

Qiao Nian looked into his starry eyes, and her breathing quickened uncontrollably.

At the thought of what Gu Zhou had just done to her, a numbing feeling spread from her spine to all the blood in her body. She felt as if she was in a boiler.

Gu Zhou raised his hand and touched Qiao Nian’s cheek, rubbing his thumb gently. He stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian. “You’re my wife, my only lover in this life. No matter what happens, you can’t leave me!”

His eyes gradually hardened, and there was a hint of a threat in his words.

Qiao Nian felt her heart beating faster and faster. It was as if millions of fireworks had exploded in her mind. She was stunned, not knowing how to speak to him.

This was the first time she had seen the domineering and stubborn Gu Zhou.

Although he was very domineering, she did not dislike him at all. Instead, she felt like she was dreaming.

She still remembered that when she first opened the paternity test document and found out that Gu Zhou and Gu Qi were father and son, she was stunned.

At that moment, she felt that Gu Zhou had lied to her.

From another perspective, to Gu Zhou, Gu Qi was his descendant, and she was just an outsider.

Qiao Nian recalled Gu Zhou telling her that he wanted to bring Xiao Qi over.

At that time, she had asked Gu Zhou.

“If I had said no just now, what would you have done?”

She still remembered Gu Zhou’s gaze back then. His eyes were cold, without a trace of warmth.

“Then I can only ask you to leave this place.”

At that time, Qiao Nian was still thinking that Gu Zhouwas really not bad as a godfather. He actually took such good care of Gu Qi.

Now she understood.

Between her and Gu Qi, Gu Zhou would only choose Gu Qi.

She liked Gu Qi a lot, but Gu Zhou’s words made her worry.

She didn’t know if Gu Zhou had confessed his love for her because he liked her, or if it was because Gu Zhou only wanted her to be Gu Qi’s mother.

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian felt as if a bucket of cold water had been poured over her head.

Her entire body turned cold.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips slightly and said, “You’re hurting me.”

Gu Zhou sat up, but he didn’t leave Qiao Nian. Instead, he stayed by her side.

Qiao Nian sat up and silently took a few steps back. Just as she was about to distance herself from Gu Zhou, Gu Zhou unexpectedly picked her up.

He even placed her on his lap.
