Chapter 1768 - 1768 Bodyguard

Lina took a deep breath and tried her best to adjust her mentality. She looked up at Chen Qing with clear eyes.

“I came over because Mark asked me to pick up Wright. Since Wright has arrived safely at his castle and it’s getting late, I’ll go back first.”

Lina lowered her head and did not dare to look at Chen Qing again. She hurriedly walked out. Just as she walked into the corridor, she heard footsteps behind her.

Lina frowned slightly. She walked faster, but no matter how fast she was, Chen Qing could follow her closely.

Compared to Lina’s anxiety, Chen Qing walked unhurriedly. There was no need to be anxious at all.

When Lina walked to the door of the room and was about to enter, she saw Chen Qing standing behind her in a suit and leather shoes, as if he wanted to follow her in.

Lina looked at Chen Qing in front of her and frowned slightly. She said disapprovingly, “Why have you been following me?”Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“The president has already said before that I’m your personal bodyguard.” When Chen Qing said the words “bodyguard”, his tone became slightly heavier, and a gentle smile appeared on his face. “If I don’t follow you, who will I follow?”

When Lina heard Chen Qing’s words, she couldn’t help but frown. She said in a low voice, “Aren’t you here to send Wright off? Wright is very important to us. Shouldn’t you take good care of him?”

Chen Qing said with a calm expression, “My mission is to protect you. As for Wright, that’s Second Young Madam’s target.”

When Lina heard Chen Qing’s words, her heart could not help but beat faster. His face was cold. When he said those words, he looked very calm, but his words were touching.

When he looked at her lovingly, she could not bear to look away.

Was this why her mother often said love is blind and beauty is in the eye of the beholder?

Lina lowered her eyes slightly. She did not dare to look into Chen Qing’s eyes again, afraid that Chen Qing would see that she was shy. She raised her hand and tucked her hair behind her ear. She said softly, “Chen Qing, actually, I’m very safe now.”

“Mark needs me now. He needs me to marry Wright, so he won’t hurt me at all. But it’s different with Nian Nian…” Before Lina could finish, she felt Chen Qing take a step towards her.

Lina stepped back instinctively, but the door was behind her. She pressed her back against it. If she didn’t open the door, there was no way out.

Seeing that Chen Qing still wanted to go forward, Lina hurriedly raised her hand to block Chen Qing. She looked up at Chen Qing and said seriously, “Don’t come over.”

She had already tried her best to control herself. She was really worried that she would hug Chen Qing uncontrollably and tell him how much she missed him.

However, she could not do that. She had already made up her mind not to have anything to do with Chen Qing anymore.

She could not give Chen Qing any more hope, because she did not want Chen Qing to be hurt in any way.

Their relationship would stop here. It was the best ending for them.

Lina slowly lowered her eyes to hide the pain in them.

Chen Qing looked at Lina intently, his eyes filled with heartache. He still remembered that Lina was in a daze this morning. She did not look good at all.

Although Lina looked much better now, the darkness in her eyes still showed that she had not rested well.

Chen Qing’s gaze gradually moved down and finally landed on Lina’s bandaged hand.

“Does it still hurt?”

His low and hoarse voice was like a gentle feather, calming Lina’s uneasy heart.

Lina subconsciously wanted to answer Chen Qing’s question, but she remembered that she had to keep a distance from Chen Qing now. Then, she hid her hand behind her back and shook her head gently. She said in a low voice, “It doesn’t hurt anymore.”

“It really doesn’t hurt anymore?”

Lina took a deep breath and looked up at Chen Qing. She met Chen Qing’s concerned eyes and could clearly see her face reflected in Chen Qing’s eyes.

It was as if nothing around him mattered anymore. She seemed to occupy his entire world.
