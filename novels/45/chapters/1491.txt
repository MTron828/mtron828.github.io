1492 Hypnotic worm

The president stopped in his tracks and looked at Qiao Nian.

A trace of hesitation flashed in the president’s eyes.

Not only was Madam unwilling to let others see her in a sorry state when her illness acted up, but he was also unwilling to let others see her when her illness acted up, much less let the people in An City see her face.

But now, Dr. Ollie could no longer stabilize Madam’s condition. Qiao Nian’s medical skills seemed to be even better than Dr. Ollie’s.

Qiao Nian was Madam’s hope for recovery, but this hope was like a beautiful rose with thorns.

The president’s brow furrowed. He couldn’t let this opportunity pass. He hoped she would recover.

His gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. With a firm expression, he said, “I’ll discuss it with her after she wakes up.”

When Qiao Nian heard the president’s words, she nodded and said, “Okay.”

Qiao Nian knew in her heart that the president was already willing to let her see Madam President. She had already waited for so many days. A few more days wouldn’t make a difference.

Dr. Ollie had already arrived with the medicine box. He helped the president treat his injuries, not forgetting to give him a tetanus shot.

At this moment, there was a knock on the door.

A servant’s respectful voice came from outside. “Mr. President, Princess Annie is here!”

Qiao Nian’s mind raced. Princess Annie should be the daughter of the First Earl.

Yesterday, Wright had attacked Lina. Before this matter was over, the First Earl had actually sent his daughter again.

Qiao Nian stole a glance at the president and saw that his expression had darkened. She stood quietly at the side, not saying anything. She was very curious about what the First Earl wanted to do.

However, this also made Qiao Nian realize that the conflict between the European royal families had reached its climax.

The president’s expression darkened. He clenched his fists and no longer tried his best to suppress his anger.

He said coldly, “Get someone to bring her to the living room.”

“Yes.” The servant received a reply from the president and left.

Dr. Ollie had already finished injecting the president. He stood quietly at the side, packing up the medicine box.

“Madam Gu, I’m really sorry about today. I might not be able to entertain you personally.”

When the president heard Qiao Nian’s words, he laughed and continued, “Ask Lina to accompany you and walk around.”

“Thank you, President!”

With that, everyone left the room.

With a cold expression, the president walked to the other side. Dr. Ollie hurriedly followed.

Qiao Nian looked at the President’s retreating back and narrowed her eyes. Strange, if the President was going to see Princess Annie, why did he bring Dr. Ollie along?

Qiao Nian retracted her gaze and her gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face not far away. She saw Gu Zhou sitting in the pavilion, drinking tea. She quickly walked over.

Gu Zhou stood up and he stared at Qiao Nian’s face. He sized her up carefully before heaving a sigh of relief. The coldness in his body gradually dissipated.

Qiao Nian walked up to Gu Zhou with a gentle smile on her face. She took the initiative to place her hand in Gu Zhou’s outstretched palm.

Gu Zhou asked seriously, “Has Madam President’s condition stabilized?” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s question, she shook her head. She looked around. Only Chen Qing was standing not far away. Only then did she say in a voice that only the two of them could hear, “Madam President’s condition is a little strange. Although her pulse shows symptoms of cerebral palsy, she doesn’t look like she was born with cerebral palsy. Instead, it looks more like a mental illness. Moreover, her pulse seems to reveal something else. I think it’s a Hypnotic worm.”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, his eyes instantly darkened. His other hand casually twirled the pendant on his hand, as if he was thinking deeply.
