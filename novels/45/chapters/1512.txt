The president’s expression was frighteningly dark. Although he had no choice but to be threatened by Mark, this didn’t mean that he could accept Annie’s casual words that cursed his Madam!

The president’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face and he said, “Miss Qiao, what’s wrong with this piece of soil? Can you tell me directly?”

Annie’s heart was in her throat. She hurriedly said loudly, “Uncle, don’t listen to her lies anymore. She…”

Then, before Annie could finish speaking, the servant covered her mouth. She was so anxious that her face turned red. She couldn’t say a word.

The president’s gaze fell on Annie’s face. He said calmly, “Annie, don’t speak first. I want to hear what Miss Qiao has to say. If I really misunderstand you, I’ll apologize to you!”

Annie looked at the soil in Qiao Nian’s hand in fear, struggling with all her might.

Qiao Nian handed the soil in her hand to Chen Qing. She wanted Chen Qing to rest at home, but Chen Qing had insisted on coming.

Chen Qing took the soil and left.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on the face that loved her. She said calmly, “I think there’s definitely nothing wrong with the Falling Autumn Grass. If there’s a problem with the cultivation, it’s impossible for the Falling Autumn Grass to survive. However, when I sent over the Falling Autumn Grass, Madam President was terrified and uneasy. The only difference between my Falling Autumn Grass and Princess Annie’s Falling Autumn Grass is in the soil. As long as the laboratory tests the soil, we’ll know the problem.”

When Lina heard Qiao Nian’s words, she hurriedly said, “Every time Sister Annie sends the Falling Autumn Grass over, Dad will get the researchers to examine it. Be it the Falling Autumn Grass or the soil, there’s nothing wrong.”

The president nodded in agreement. He had doubts about the Falling Autumn Grass Mark had sent over. That was why he tested it every time.

After all, Mark had been staring at his throne. He was also wary of Mark.

When Qiao Nian heard the President’s words, her lips curved up slightly. She continued, “Mr. President, some things can’t be detected immediately. Some things won’t be discovered under normal circumstances. Some things might only be revealed after being watered or fertilized.”

Annie’s expression grew uglier and uglier, and a chill ran down her spine.

Although Qiao Nian was smiling, her smile didn’t reach her eyes. She looked at Annie not far away and said, “When the poison is released, it will be absorbed by the Falling Autumn Grass and dissipated.”

When the president heard Qiao Nian’s words, he looked at Annie sharply. Seeing Annie’s terrified expression, his heart instantly turned cold.

No wonder Mark had taken the initiative to send the Falling Autumn Grass over. He had ill intentions.

Soon, Chen Qing and the butler came in.

The butler handed the president a copy of the list of chemicals.

The president looked at the items on the list. The first few items were identical to the previous examination results, but this time, there was an additional line.

Teng Yang?

The president felt that something was wrong with Teng Yang. Otherwise, why hadn’t he been able to detect it previously? He looked at Qiao Nian, who was standing not far away.

The president handed the list to Qiao Nian. Qiao Nian glanced at Annie and saw that she was staring fixedly at the piece of paper in her hand, as if she yearned to eat it.

Qiao Nian knew what to do. She looked down at the list in her hand. There was an addition of Teng Yang.

Qiao Nian narrowed her eyes slightly, her expression complicated.

The president didn’t know what this Teng Yang was either. He hurriedly asked, “Miss Qiao, what is this Teng Yang? Why didn’t I find anything when I checked it previously? Why is it suddenly here now?”

Qiao Nian looked at Annie coldly. After some thought, she continued, “Teng Yang isn’t poisonous.”

“What?” The President looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief, his frown deepening.

Lina looked shocked, her eyes filled with surprise.

If Teng Yang wasn’t poisonous, their efforts today would have been in vain.
