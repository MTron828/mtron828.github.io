940 Still Trying to Hide

“What did you do?” Qiao Shan asked in fear.

“Lu Zhu shot my leg!” Qiao Xin pursed her lips and lowered her head, looking as if she was admitting her mistake.

When Su Xue heard this, she was stunned. She asked loudly, “Lu Zhu? Is he the eldest young master of the Lu family?”

Qiao Xin looked up at Su Xue and nodded.

Only now did she realize her regret. If it weren’t for that b*tch Song Man, how could she have provoked the Lu family?

Song Man must have jumped off a building to commit suicide because the matter had been exposed.

In the end, she became the target of the Lu family’s anger.

Qiao Shan felt a little dizzy. After thinking for a long time, he still couldn’t figure out what was going on, so he asked, “We don’t have any dealings with the Lu family. How did you provoke him?”

“He did this to me because of Qiao Nian. He even said that this time, he was just giving me a warning. He wanted me to…” Qiao Xin trailed off, shrinking her head silently.

Qiao Shan’s expression was ugly.

Su Xue frowned and asked anxiously, “What did he ask you to do?”

Qiao Yu narrowed his eyes. He recalled seeing Lu Zhu in MY previously. At that time, Lu Zhu had looked at Qiao Nian coldly. Gu Zhou had probably asked Lu Zhu to help take care of Qiao Nian, so Lu Zhu had no choice but to bring her along.

Based on his interactions with Lu Zhu, he felt that Lu Zhu was a person who insisted on his own opinions. He was rarely able to change his opinions.

Qiao Yu couldn’t figure out what was going on. He looked up at Qiao Xin and saw the complicated expression on her face. His frown deepened as he said sternly, “You still want to hide it!”

Qiao Xin was shocked by Qiao Yu’s words. She hurriedly sat up straight and looked up at Qiao Yu. Thinking of how embarrassed she had been when she found out Qiao Nian’s true identity in the hotel room, she told him about Song Man asking her for help.

When Su Xue heard Qiao Xin’s words, she nodded in agreement and said, “You did the right thing. No matter what, Song Man is the eldest daughter of the Lu family. It’s not wrong for us to be on good terms with her. Besides, we can do the Lu family a favor.”

Qiao Shan also felt that Qiao Xin was right. If it were him, he would be willing to help.

Qiao Yu narrowed his eyes at Qiao Xin. He had a nagging feeling that this matter wasn’t that simple.

“Yes, at that time, I was thinking that if we became good friends with the Lu family, it would be good for our family’s business. Then, Brother wouldn’t have to work so hard.” As Qiao Xin spoke, she looked at Qiao Yu carefully.

Qiao Xin wasn’t a fool. Ever since her parents divorced, everyone in the family had relied on her brother. If her brother left the Qiao family, the Qiao family would really be finished.

Qiao Yu looked at Qiao Xin coldly, not at all moved by Qiao Xin’s words. He questioned coldly, “If I’m not wrong, Song Man isn’t the eldest daughter of the Lu family!”

As soon as Qiao Yu finished speaking, Qiao Shan, Su Xue, and Qiao Xin were all stunned.

Qiao Xin blinked in confusion. Puzzled, she looked at Qiao Yu and asked, “Brother, how did you guess?”

Although Qiao Shan and Su Xue didn’t ask, they were also curious about how Qiao Yu had guessed it.

“Song Man… Why did she look for you?” Qiao Yu asked calmly.

Qiao Xin looked around guiltily and said in a low voice, “She just wanted my help!”

“Was she really just looking for your help to meet the Lu family?” Qiao Yu’s eyes gradually turned cold.

Qiao Xin didn’t dare to look Qiao Yu in the eye. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“If I’m not wrong, she wants to deal with Qiao Nian, and you want to deal with Qiao Nian too. That’s why the two of you were working together.” With that, Qiao Yu tried hard to suppress the anger in his heart. “She likely isn’t the eldest daughter of the Lu family!”

“What?” Su Xue was stunned. She hurriedly said, “Didn’t your sister say that Song Man took out the DNA report? Moreover, more than twenty years ago, the eldest daughter of the Lu family lost an arm. Song Man also lost an arm. Everything fits!”

Qiao Shan’s frown deepened. He shook his head in disapproval. “If Song Man is really the eldest daughter of the Lu family, she should go straight to the Lu family, not look for our daughter!”
