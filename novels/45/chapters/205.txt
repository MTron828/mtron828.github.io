Chapter 206: Tying the Blessing Bag

Matriarch Lu recalled how she had met Qiao Nian at the temple. Her expression grew gentler as she said softly, “Young Nian, if you hadn’t reminded me last time, I’m afraid I wouldn’t have been able to hold my eldest granddaughter’s birthday banquet this time. You would probably be attending my funeral instead!”

Matriarch Lu coughed. Thinking of the results of the examination, she sighed slightly and continued, “Thank you for making such a beautiful blessing bag for my poor eldest granddaughter. To express our gratitude, we’d like to invite you to have a meal with us today.”

“Alright, thank you, Madam Lu.” Qiao Nian nodded.

After that, the group arrived at the Lu family’s ancestral hall. This place was dedicated to the ancestors of the Lu family. Incense was burning in the ancestral hall, indicating that the Lu family’s incense offerings would continue indefinitely into the future.

Everyone in the Lu family offered incense one by one. After that, Matriarch Gu and Qiao Nian offered incense to the ancestors of the Gu family.

After offering incense, Matriarch Lu brought everyone to the small courtyard beside the ancestral hall.

This small courtyard was filled with all kinds of plants and flowers, as well as many toys. Qiao Nian didn’t think that this place looked like the mourning hall of the precious daughter of the Lu family. Instead, it looked more like a place that was often inhabited.

Everyone walked into the room, which was furnished very warmly. At a glance, one could tell that this was a style young girls would like.

There were also many framed photographs hanging at the entrance. The same baby was pictured in all of them.

The baby’s cheeks were puffed up, and she looked extremely adorable. Her small mouth was slightly curved, and she was smiling brightly.

Looking at the photographs of this child, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but want to step forward and pinch her chubby face.

However, all she could see were photos.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but sigh. The eldest daughter of the Lu family was truly unfortunate. She had passed away at such a young age.

Qiao Nian’s gaze inadvertently fell on the entrance. She saw Lu Zhu looking out with his back to the room. For some reason, she felt that his back looked a little lonely. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

It seemed that Lu Zhu really cared about his sister. That was why he was having such a strong reaction!

Qiao Nian followed everyone in. The girl’s bedroom was like a castle in a fairy tale.

The bedroom was filled with clothes for a young lady of all ages.

Seeing this, Qiao Nian was a little moved. She envied the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

The eldest daughter of the Lu family had passed away so many years ago, but the Lu family had still created a dream-like world for her. It was as if they wanted her to live in this courtyard and house forever.

This was a kind of kinship Qiao Nian had never experienced before.

Matriarch Gu glanced at the bed and turned her head, saying, “Lu Zhu didn’t follow us? I wanted him to tie the blessing bag here.”

Matriarch Lu took the blessing bag from Matriarch Gu. Her eyes were misty as she said in a choked voice, “He… he still hasn’t forgiven himself.”

When Qiao Nian heard Matriarch Lu’s words, she had a vague feeling that the death of the eldest daughter of the Lu family had something to do with Lu Zhu.

“Sigh, this child…” Matriarch Gu sighed and said helplessly,” Back then, he took the young lass out with him. She got lost by accident. He can’t be blamed for this! ”

“But he refused to forgive himself. All these years, he has never stepped foot into this room.” Matriarch Lu sighed.

When Lu Qi heard this, her eyes turned red. She said softly, “I believe Sister won’t want Brother to continue blaming himself.”

Matriarch Lu hung the blessing bag next to the urn by the bed. Only then did she stand up straight, clasp her hands together, and give a soft prayer.

After she opened her eyes, she touched the urn sadly. There was heartache in her eyes.

Matriarch Gu and Qiao Nian stood where they were to offer incense and pray for the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

Matriarch Lu wiped her tears, then left reluctantly.

Lu Qi felt terrible too. Although she had never met her elder sister, as she grew older, she felt worse and worse when she saw all that her family had done for her sister.

When they came out, Matriarch Gu realized that Matriarch Lu didn’t look well. She comforted Matriarch Lu for a while before suggesting that they take their leave.
