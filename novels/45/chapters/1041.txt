1042 Bullied

The more He Cheng thought about it, the angrier he became. The peaceful atmosphere was interrupted by Qiao Xin. He slapped Qiao Xin’s face and said angrily, “How dare you bite me. You have a death wish!”

He Cheng kicked Qiao Xin’s injured leg, causing her to cry out in pain. “Let me out, or I won’t pay you the rest!”

Qiao Xin looked at He Cheng with teary eyes. She was clearly a proud daughter of heaven. How could she suffer so much?

Qiao Nian should be the one suffering. She should be the one standing at the side cheering as Qiao Nian was insulted!

Why?

Why was she the one who had been wronged?

“If you let me go, I’ll give you an additional million yuan!” Qiao Xin’s eyes gradually hardened. No one wouldn’t be tempted by money.

“One million?” He Cheng slowly retracted his foot and looked at Qiao Xin thoughtfully. “Three million more!”

“Okay!” Afraid that He Cheng would change his mind, Qiao Xin agreed without hesitation. “I’ll give you an additional three million yuan. Can you let me go now?”

He Cheng had always been an insatiable person. Seeing that Qiao Xin had agreed without hesitation, he sneered. “I don’t think three million is enough. Ten million. Ten million, and I’ll let you go!”

“You…”

“Transfer the money now!” He Cheng wasn’t a fool. What if Qiao Xin went back on her word? Of course, he had to get the money first.

Qiao Xin only had five million yuan at most. She didn’t have that much money at all. It was impossible for her to ask her brother for money now. If her brother knew that she still wanted to deal with Qiao Nian, he would definitely scold her.

At the thought of this, Qiao Xin said hesitantly, “I don’t have enough money on hand. I’m going to call my mother and ask her to transfer the money to me. She…”

“Are you joking?” He Cheng raised his eyebrows slightly. When we were in the Lu family, the Lu family had already told me what had happened. “You were sent to Lu Zhu by your mother. Do you think your mother will give you money?”

Qiao Xin felt as if a bucket of cold water had been poured over her heart. She looked at He Cheng in disbelief. “You’re spouting nonsense. How could my mother do this!”

Previously, Lu Zhu had also told her that she had been sent over by her mother.

But she thought about it carefully for a long time. Her mother loved her so much and treated her so well. How could she do such a thing?

Lu Zhu must be lying to her. He wanted to sow discord. She would not fall for it!

“Use your brain. If Lu Zhu tells Su Xue that he’ll deal with your brother if Su Xue doesn’t hand you over to him, do you think your mother will hand you over?” He Cheng sighed helplessly. It seemed that he wouldn’t be able to get that sum of money.

He had initially thought that if he had ten million yuan, it would be fine if he stayed in prison for a few years. Since he didn’t, he could only do as Lu Zhu said.

“No, that’s impossible!” Qiao Xin cried until her face was covered in snot and tears. She wiped her tears with her arm and shook her head vigorously. “That’s impossible. Mom would never do that. You’re lying!”

“I’m lying? If I’m lying, then why was I arrested too? You should be happy. If you weren’t still useful, you might have gone to prison! You just have to play with me. You won’t lose a body part. What’s there to cry about!”

“Don’t touch me. I know you’re lying to me!” Qiao Xin shouted angrily.

“Why are you so fierce to me? You should settle scores with your mother and ask her why she handed you over to Lu Zhu!”

Qiao Xin felt as if she had been struck by lightning.

Her mother, whom she trusted the most, had actually done such a thing? FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Before Qiao Xin could recover from Su Xue’s betrayal, she was pressed under He Cheng.

…

After He Cheng was done, he went straight to the bathroom to take a shower. He was still humming a tune in the bathroom, looking to be in a good mood.

Qiao Xin looked like an old doll that had been abandoned on the floor. There were many marks on her snow-white skin, and there were several handprints on her face.

Her eyelashes fluttered a few times before she slowly opened her eyes.

Why?

Why did everyone abandon her?

She was clearly so kind and beautiful.

What had she done wrong?

Was God torturing her like this?
