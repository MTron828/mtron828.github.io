Chapter 266: Signature

In the past, she had never dared to imagine that she would be able to get Mr. Dong Hua’s autograph.

Qiao Nian’s hand gently caressed Mr. Dong Hua’s signature. She still felt as if she was in a dream.

Wang Xuan stood at the side, extremely envious.

She had already received many surprises when she arrived at the Gu residence today.

She met the legendary Mr. Dong Hua.

She had initially thought that Mr. Dong Hua was a white-haired old man who had spent his entire life composing so many beautiful songs. She had never expected Mr. Dong Hua to be such a beautiful man.

Oh my god!

Wang Xuan also felt as if she was in a dream. Everything around her was too unreal.

Qiao Nian looked down at the name on the violin, her heart filled with gratitude.

Ever since she turned 23, the Goddess of Luck seemed to have descended on her. She had gained too much happiness and beauty.

Gu Zhou, who was standing at the side, looked at the smile on Qiao Nian’s face. This was the first time he had seen happiness in Qiao Nian’s beautiful fox-like eyes.

He had never seen Qiao Nian like this before.

Qiao Nian seemed to love music more than he had imagined.

Gu Zhou’s eyes flickered. His gaze fell on Lu Nian’s face and he said, “Grandma isn’t in good health. She’s been thinking about you. This time, you’ll stay here for a while longer.”

Lu Nian looked at Gu Zhou in surprise. Why did he feel that something was wrong? Logically speaking, Second Brother should have chased him away after the meal.

In the past, every time he came back and had a meal, no matter how thick-skinned he was, Second Brother would chase him away without hesitation.

Gu Zhou’s reason was simple. He was too noisy.

Could it be that Second Brother no longer found him noisy?

Jiang Yue, who was standing at the side, looked surprised. Her gaze finally landed on Qiao Nian’s face and she narrowed her eyes. Could it be that Brother Ah Zhou wanted Lu Nian to stay because of Qiao Nian?

Zhao Qian, who was standing at the side, had long seen through the truth of the matter. She pursed her lips and smiled. Seeing that Wang Xuan was still looking confused, she moved closer to Wang Xuan and explained softly.

After that, Zhao Qian and Wang Xuan looked at Gu Zhou with stars in their eyes. They had always thought that Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian were a couple. These two people were simply too sweet!

Without waiting for Lu Nian to speak, Gu Zhou said to Butler Ye, “Butler Ye, go and arrange his room now.”

“Yes.” After agreeing, Butler Ye turned around and left.

Lu Nian came back to his senses and tried hard to suppress the joy in his heart. He nodded and said, “I came back this time to spend more time with Grandma. I’ve also specially composed a song for Grandma to be released on the day of the concert.”

When Matriarch Gu heard Lu Nian’s words, she smiled lovingly. “Really?”

“Of course!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Nian’s words, her eyes instantly lit up. She asked carefully, “Mr. Dong Hua, can you let Grandma listen to this song first?”

At this moment, Wang Xuan was also looking at Lu Nian with starry eyes. She was a hardcore fan of Mr. Dong Hua. If she could hear Mr. Dong Hua’s performance today, she would have no regrets in her life.

Matriarch Gu glanced at Qiao Nian. Qiao Nian was usually dignified and elegant, but she had never looked so expectant. Matriarch Gu’s heart softened. She didn’t want Qiao Nian to be rejected, so she smiled at Lu Nian and said, “That’s good. I want to hear it too.”

Lu Nian’s sexy thin lips curved up slightly. Smiling, he said, “Since Grandma wants to hear it, I’ll play a song for you now.”

With that, Lu Nian’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. “Can I borrow your violin?”

Qiao Nian hurriedly nodded and handed the violin to Lu Nian with both hands.

Then, Qiao Nian walked over to Wang Xuan and sat down with her and Zhao Qian. Like a good student quietly listening to class, she waited quietly for Lu Nian to play the violin.
