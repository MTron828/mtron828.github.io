Gu Qing sighed and looked up at Lu Zhu. She said kindly, “Ah Zhu, on account of our past relationship, can you give her a way out?”

Lu Zhu’s gaze landed on Gu Qing’s face, and his eyes darkened. He pursed his lips slightly and said coldly, “Take good care of her in the future. Don’t let her set foot in Yong’an Building again.”

“I will.” Gu Qing smiled and dragged Su Sheng out.

Su Sheng’s legs were as limp as noodles. All her weight was leaning on Gu Qing.

When Gu Qing dragged her away from Lu Zhu, the tears in Su Sheng’s eyes fell. She looked at Gu Qing in fear. “Senior Sister!”

Qiao Nian, who was standing in the piano room, watched as Gu Qing and Su Sheng left. Her frown deepened.

Su Sheng, who was ignorant, would only be a burden to Gu Qing if she followed her.

At this moment, Qiao Nian heard Lu Nian ask, “Sister Nian, where did you get your score?”

Qiao Nian came back to her senses. Her gaze fell on Lu Nian’s face, and her eyes were filled with confusion.

Actually, she didn’t know where she had seen the score before.

When she first arrived at the piano room, this melody appeared in her mind. She only relied on the memories in her mind to play this song. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Moreover, she didn’t know that Lu Nian had written this song.

Lu Nian narrowed his eyes slightly and looked at Qiao Nian nervously. He wanted to hear Qiao Nian’s explanation.

He believed that Qiao Nian wouldn’t steal anything, but he had written that song in his early years, and he had never publicized it to the public. How did Qiao Nian know this song?

He wanted to hear Qiao Nian’s explanation.

Could it be that he and Qiao Nian really had a telepathic connection and wrote the same tune at the same time?

Actually, this was not impossible.

At this moment, Lu Zhu walked in. The coldness on his body instantly disappeared. He looked at Qiao Nian with concern and asked, “Nian Nian, are you alright?”

“I’m fine.” Qiao Nian forced a smile.

Nian Nian?

Lu Nian came back to his senses. He frowned slightly and turned to look at his brother.

His good brother was still looking at Qiao Nian worriedly.

Lu Nian’s frown deepened. Just as he was about to speak, he heard his brother speak again.

“Then, if anyone bullies you, just tell me. I won’t let you suffer at all!”

“Actually, it was nothing just now. Besides, I can handle it!” Qiao Nian gave a sweet smile.

Lu Nian’s frown deepened. He recalled what the mistress had said. Then, seeing his brother’s attitude towards Qiao Nian, he had a bad feeling.

Big Brother’s concern for Qiao Nian wasn’t superficial at all, nor was it an average relationship. It was a heartfelt concern.

Big Brother had never been so concerned about a girl. Although Big Brother was not afraid of women, he rejected most girls.

Lu Nian was deep in thought when suddenly, a cold gaze swept over. He instantly came back to his senses and met Lu Zhu’s gaze.

“It’s all your fault!” Lu Zhu looked at Lu Nian coldly, his voice filled with blame!

Lu Nian was speechless.

“If you hadn’t been chasing after Nian Nian to ask about the score, how could Nian Nian have been mistaken for a thief? When there are outsiders around, don’t you know how to restrain yourself?”

Lu Nian frowned slightly.

What his brother said made sense but he seemed to dote on Qiao Nian more?

If he remembered correctly, Big Brother hated Qiao Nian the most before he went to MY.

“I’ve told you many times before not to be rash in the future. You’re already so old, yet you still need me to teach you!” Lu Zhu frowned and continued to reprimand him, as if he was very dissatisfied with Lu Nian’s performance just now.

Lu Nian’s frown deepened. He looked at Lu Zhu intently and said nothing.

When Qiao Nian heard her eldest brother reprimand her second brother, she hurriedly smiled and said, “Brother, don’t be angry. Actually, Brother Ah Nian has already explained it to Su Sheng. It’s just that Su Sheng was too emotional and didn’t listen at all!”

When Lu Zhu heard Qiao Nian’s words, his gaze fell on her face. The coldness in his eyes gradually dissipated. He pursed his lips for a while before saying stiffly, “You really know how to feel sorry for him!”

Lu Zhu looked at Qiao Nian helplessly.
