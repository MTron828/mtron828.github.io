767 Don’t Like Meat

Unfortunately, Mommy was in Hai Cheng, which was too far away.

Xiao Shi was so obedient and adorable. Mommy must have taught her so well. She must be a very kind and warm person.

He wondered what his mother looked like and if she would look like her sister.

Seeing that the two children had already agreed to her suggestion, Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. Smiling, she said, “Xiao Shi, after we eat, we’ll go home together!”

When Xiao Shi heard Qiao Nian’s words, she looked at her expectantly and nodded vigorously.

Xiao Shi lowered her head and was about to eat when she realized that her bowl was filled with pork ribs. They looked, smelled, and tasted delicious. She was so hungry that she was about to drool.

Although the ribs smelled good, she felt a little sad when she thought about how her mommy could only eat some vegetarian dishes while lying on the bed.

As their family was very poor, they rarely bought meat. If only she could bring all these ribs back for her mommy to eat!

However, if she really brought the pork ribs back to her mommy, it would waste a lot of time and money to go back and forth. It would also delay her mommy’s reunion with her grandparents.

Qiao Nian’s attention was fixed on Xiao Shi. Seeing that Xiao Shi was staring at the bowl in front of her without moving her chopsticks, she asked gently, “Xiao Shi, why aren’t you eating? Could it be that you don’t like these dishes?”

Xiao Shi looked up at Qiao Nian and shook her head gently. “Auntie Nian Nian, I don’t usually like to eat meat. I’ll just eat vegetables!”

Actually, it wasn’t that she didn’t like meat. She also wanted to eat meat.

However, when she thought of the bland food her mommy had been eating at home, she would feel very sorry for her mommy if she took a bite of meat now.

Mommy had worked so hard to give birth to her and raise her alone, but she still ate meat behind her Mommy’s back. That made her an unfilial daughter.

Qiao Nian looked at Xiao Shi in confusion, frowning slightly.

Due to Gu Zhou’s schizophrenia, she had read many psychology books in the past.

She was 100% sure that Xiao Shi had lied.

When Xiao Shi first answered her, her eyes were wandering. This meant that she really wanted to eat meat, but why was she lying?

Qiao Nian recalled Gu Qi’s reminder.

From Gu Qi’s words, she was certain that she had grown up in a poor family. It was precisely because of this that she did not dare to live a good life or eat meat. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

It must be because she thought about her mommy at home. She was really a filial child.

Qiao Nian really wanted to meet Gu Qi and his mother.

That girl had also been schemed against like Gu Zhou.

When Qiao Nian thought of how that girl had once been with Gu Zhou, she had a strange feeling.

This feeling made her feel very uncomfortable.

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze slightly, hiding the thoughts in her eyes. She smiled at Xiao Shi and said, “If you don’t like meat, then don’t eat it. Just drink more soup!”

Xiao Shi’s eyes lit up. She nodded.

Gu Qi sat beside Xiao Shi. He could clearly feel the emotions Xiao Shi had just restrained.

He didn’t know what his sister had experienced .

He thought his sister must have had a hard time.

That was why his sister didn’t dare to eat meat now.

Gu Qi clenched his fists involuntarily. If he had known earlier that he had a sister, he would have definitely brought her back and protected her well. He would never have let her suffer.

Gu Qi recalled that his father had gone to look for Mommy previously. No wonder his father hadn’t found any clues about Mommy. Hai Cheng was a very complicated place. There were all kinds of people there. His father probably didn’t expect his mother and sister to live in such a place!

Qiao Nian noticed that both children looked troubled. She couldn’t help but frown and ask, “Xiao Cheng, does your mommy live in Hai Cheng with you?”

“Yes!”

After receiving an affirmative answer, Qiao Nian instantly understood that the reason why she didn’t eat meatwas 100% because of her mommy.
