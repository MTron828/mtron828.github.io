Chapter 181 The Curtain Rises

At the Huangtian Hotel.

After Chen Qing parked the car in the parking lot, he saw many luxury cars around him.

Qiao Nian walked at the front of the group. Suddenly, a security guard stopped her and said politely, “Miss, please show me your reservation number.”

Gu Zhou strode over to Qiao Nian’s side.

When the security guard saw Gu Zhou, his expression froze. He said respectfully, “Welcome, CEO. May I know if you need anyone to receive you?”

Radiating a cold aura, Gu Zhou said in a low voice, “I’m just passing by. Do not make my presence known.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Yes, sir.” The security guard hurriedly stood aside.

Qiao Nian glanced at the security guard and muttered, “No wonder everyone says that the Gu family is the emperor of An City. You can’t walk five feet without passing by one of the Gu family’s businesses!”

When Qiao Nian thought about how Gu Zhou had mocked her yesterday, suggesting that she thought he couldn’t afford to stay at the Huangtian Hotel, she felt awkward.

The Gu family was truly very wealthy.

After entering the elevator, Qiao Nian pressed the button for the ninth floor.

When Qiao Nian had booked a room for Qiu Nan, she had also booked a room for herself next door. That way, she would be able to know what was happening in the next room in advance.

After entering the room, Qiao Nian walked to the French windows and pulled open the curtains. She sat lazily on a hanging basket chair, enjoying the morning sun. Gu Zhou, on the other hand, sat down on the sofa in the living room. He picked up a magazine and began reading it earnestly.

After Chen Qing prepared drinks for Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian, he suddenly sensed that he was a huge third wheel. He was disturbing Second Young Master and Young Madam’s leisure time. After some thought, he decided that it was better to stand outside, so he pushed the door open and left.

After a while, the phone began to ring.

Qiao Nian took out her phone and saw that it was Qiao Shan calling. Thinking of what was about to happen, her lips curved up slightly. In a good mood, she picked up the phone. “Hello?”

“Qiao Nian, I’ve already arrived at the hotel, but I can’t seem to get through to your mother. Has she arrived?”

Qiao Nian looked at the ocean in the far distance and replied obediently, “I can’t get through to her either. Did she set her phone to airplane mode? I’m already on the ninth floor. When I asked at the front desk, they told me that a lady had already taken the room key. I’m guessing it’s Mom. I think she might have already arrived at the room.”

“That’s good. Qiao Yu has an important meeting today, so he won’t be able to attend our family meeting. However, I’ve brought Xin Xin with me. Let’s have a meal as a family of four!”

The joy on Qiao Nian’s face instantly vanished. She narrowed her eyes slightly. What a pity. She couldn’t let Qiao Yu, this pervert, see his beloved mother’s true colors.

But it didn’t matter. There was still time!

Sooner or later, Qiao Yu would see Su Xue’s ugly side.

She looked forward to seeing Qiao Yu’s expression then. It would definitely be interesting

Qiao Nian said sweetly, “Then I’ll wait for you at the elevator. Let’s go in together!”

After Qiao Nian hung up, she stood up and walked out.

Gu Zhou stood up and followed Qiao Nian.

The two of them stood at the elevator door. A minute later, the door slowly opened.

Qiao Shan was wearing a well-cut suit and leather shoes. His hair was combed back, and he looked very formal.

Qiao Xin had also dressed up meticulously. In a pink gown, she looked extremely adorable. Along the way, she had attracted the attention of many passers-by.

This was the first time Qiao Xin had been to such a high-end place, so she wanted to dress up. It would be great if she could meet a lifelong benefactor here.

“Sister!” Qiao Xin greeted gently when she saw Qiao Nian. Her gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face. “Brother-in-law.”

Qiao Nian gave a polite and distant smile. Seeing Qiao Xin’s smug expression, she felt a wave of excitement for what was to happen later. She was looking forward to seeing Qiao Xin’s expression then.

Seeing Qiao Shan walk over, Qiao Nian handed the room card to him.
