Chapter 199: Eidetic Memory

“Thank you, Director.” Holding the blood sample form, Qiao Nian walked out of the office. Following the instructions on the form, she left a blood sample in the hospital.

Actually, Qiao Nian didn’t really need to find her biological parents. For so many years, she and the elderly grandfather who had taken her in had relied upon each other for survival. The words “Dad” and “Mom” were very unfamiliar to her.

Even if she found her parents, they would only be strangers to her. In the past twenty years or so, she had never been involved in their lives, nor had they been involved in hers.

She had never thought of getting any compensation from them. She was just curious why they didn’t want her back then.

…

At the Gu family villa.

After Gu Zhou returned to his office, he sat down at his desk and wrote down the code Qiao Nian had typed in the car.

Fortunately, he had an eidetic memory. Otherwise, he might not have been able to memorize the entire chunk of code.

After Gu Zhou finished writing, he handed the piece of paper to Chen Qing and said, “Investigate.”

Chen Qing was slightly stunned. Slowly, he looked at Gu Zhou. “Second Young Master, what are these?”

“If I’m not wrong, it should be a hacker’s code. Go and find out what this code is used for.” After Gu Zhou finished speaking, he recalled how Qiao Nian had looked when she was typing the code. She had looked calm and composed, as if she had memorized this code a long time ago.

Chen Qing nodded and left with the piece of paper.

About half an hour later, Chen Qing walked in.

“Have you found anything?” Gu Zhou’s gaze moved from the documents on the table to Chen Qing’s face.

There was a trace of excitement on Chen Qing’s face. He handed the piece of paper to Gu Zhou and said, “Second Young Master, I’ve asked a couple of hackers to investigate. This set of codes is designed to isolate high-level signals. It’s said to be very advanced. This is the first time he’s seen such a code. The hacker even said that someone who can write such a code must be an expert hacker!”

“Advanced?” Gu Zhou murmured.

“Yes, this code is very advanced. It took them more than half an hour to crack it.” At this point, Chen Qing grew even more excited. “Second Young Master, why don’t we find the hacker who wrote this code to help us investigate the truth about what happened five years ago? That way, we’ll definitely be able to find out who our Young Master is!”

Gu Zhou frowned slightly. After a long while, he said, “Qiao Nian.”

Chen Qing didn’t seem to understand what Gu Zhou meant. He hurriedly said, “Young Madam hasn’t returned yet!”

“The person who wrote this code is Qiao Nian!” Gu Zhou looked up at Chen Qing, enunciating each word clearly.

When Chen Qing heard Gu Zhou’s words, his jaw dropped to the ground. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Chen Qing was stunned. He opened his mouth, but no words came out.

How many secrets did his Young Madam have?

If he hadn’t already investigated Qiao Nian, he would never have thought that Qiao Nian had hidden so many secrets.

After Chen Qing settled down, he asked solemnly, “Second Young Master, do you want us to get Second Young Madam to help in our investigation?”

“There’s no need. Go and keep an eye on her. Let me know when she’s back!”

“Yes, sir.”

When Chen Qing walked out of Gu Zhou’s office, he was still incredibly excited. Gu Zhou’s words lingered in his memory.

Indeed, someone as outstanding as Second Young Madam was worthy of Young Master.

After another hour, Chen Qing walked back in and said to Gu Zhou, “Second Young Madam has returned!”

“Noted. You can leave first!”

Gu Zhou said indifferently, his gaze falling on the contracts on the table.

After reading through both contracts and confirming that there were no mistakes, Gu Zhou signed the contracts and stood up to walk towards Qiao Nian’s bedroom.

Ever since Qiao Nian had returned from the hospital, she had been feeling very unwell. Hence, she had taken a bath. After she was done, she took out the materials she had prepared for the blessing bag she was making for the late young daughter of the Lu family. Only after calming herself down did she begin to sew.
