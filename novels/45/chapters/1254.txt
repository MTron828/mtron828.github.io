Butler Zhao started the car again. The child could speak with his mouth wide open.

Xiao Bao continued to please Butler Zhao obediently. “Uncle Zhao, believe me. I’ll definitely listen to you. I won’t let Daddy worry.”

At this point, Xiao Bao’s eyes were filled with a bright smile. He raised his eyebrows slightly. “Look, I already said that he’s Daddy, not Uncle!”

When Butler Zhao heard Xiao Bao’s words, he couldn’t help but laugh out loud. This child had been smart since he was young.

To Xiao Bao, the person closest to him in this world was Master. Master had always taken care of Xiao Bao, and Master was all Xiao Bao had.

Previously, Master had asked Xiao Bao to call him “Uncle”, but Xiao Bao was unwilling and kept calling Master “Daddy”.

Butler Zhao drove back to the villa. He had just parked the car when he saw Mr. Chen walking over with a dark expression.

When Mr. Chen was angry, his eyes were very cold. Butler Zhao knew that something was wrong. Master must know what Xiao Bao had done.

Xiao Bao unbuckled his seatbelt and clenched his fists. His heart couldn’t help but race.

Butler Zhao and Xiao Bao got out of the car and walked up to Mr. Chen. Seeing Mr. Chen standing with his hands behind his back, Butler Zhao secretly gave Xiao Bao a sympathetic look.

Mr. Chen’s gaze fell on Xiao Bao’s face, but his words were directed at Butler Zhao. “Go ahead.”

When Butler Zhao heard his master’s calm voice, his heart skipped a beat.

The more Master acted like this, the more it meant that he was angry. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Butler Zhao replied, “Yes.” Just as he was about to leave, Xiao Bao grabbed his clothes.

Xiao Bao wanted to take the opportunity to leave with Butler Zhao.

Mr. Chen looked at Xiao Bao coldly and said in a low voice, “Xiao Bao!”

Xiao Bao’s heart jumped to his throat. He grabbed Butler Zhao’s shirt uneasily and did not let go. He carefully looked up at Mr. Chen.

When he saw Mr. Chen’s displeased gaze, he immediately gasped in fear. Reluctantly, he let go of Butler Zhao’s shirt and looked at Mr. Chen pitifully.

After regaining his freedom, Butler Zhao looked at Xiao Bao sympathetically. At the same time, he gave Xiao Bao a look of blessings before leaving.

In MY, Master was like a god. No matter what secret it was, as long as he wanted to know, he could find out.

“Daddy.” Xiao Bao knew that he could no longer count on Butler Zhao. He began to pretend to be obedient in front of Mr. Chen.

Mr. Chen pursed his lips. “Come with me!”

Xiao Bao heaved a sigh of relief and followed Mr. Chen with his head lowered.

How should he appease his father later?

He had often angered his father in the past. Every time, he would hug his father’s thigh and call him “Daddy”. His father would quickly forgive him.

After making up his mind, Xiao Bao tentatively wanted to hug Mr. Chen’s thigh, but he realized that his father was walking very quickly this time. He was no longer as leisurely as he usually was.

Xiao Bao was about to hug him when he met Mr. Chen’s displeased gaze.

“Come to the study.” As Mr. Chen spoke, he walked into the study and sat down on the office chair first.

Xiao Bao stood at the door, unwilling to enter. Only if he made a big mistake would his father bring him to the study to talk to him.

Xiao Bao hugged the door frame and stole a glance at Mr. Chen. He saw Mr. Chen sitting there staring at him expressionlessly.

“Come in!” Mr. Chen’s voice was very serious. “Close the door!”

When Xiao Bao heard Mr. Chen’s words, his eyes instantly turned red. Reluctantly, he walked into the study, not forgetting to close the door.

“Daddy.” Xiao Bao moved towards the desk step by step and said in a low voice, “Xiao Bao knows his mistake.”

Mr. Chen sat in his office chair and looked at Xiao Bao expressionlessly. He asked solemnly, “What did you do wrong?”

Xiao Bao frowned. When he heard Mr. Chen’s words, he stood in front of the desk and tiptoed, holding the edge of the desk with his small hand. He looked extremely pitiful. “Daddy, don’t be angry. It’s not good for your health to be angry. Xiao Bao really knows his mistake this time. Xiao Bao shouldn’t go to dangerous places.”

Seeing that Mr. Chen was still expressionless, Xiao Bao continued, “When Xiao Bao goes somewhere else, he should take the initiative to tell Daddy, right?”
