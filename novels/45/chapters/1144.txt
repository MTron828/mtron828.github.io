Chapter 1145: I Thought I Was Dreaming

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

When Qiao Nian heard Su Yan’s words, she was slightly stunned. She looked at Su Yan in surprise.

When the Lu family saw Su Yan like this, they lowered their heads in sadness. Tears silently fell from Su Yan’s eyes.

Seeing this, Qiao Nian’s heart ached. She hurriedly reached out to help Su Yan wipe her tears. Just as she was about to retract her hand, Su Yan grabbed her hand.

“Thank you for being willing to see Mom in my dream.” Su Yan looked at Qiao Nian with tears in her eyes. Her vision was blurry, and she couldn’t see Qiao Nian’s face clearly. She took a tissue from the side and wiped her tears, her voice choked with emotion. “Don’t worry, Mom will definitely remember what you look like now. When the time comes, I’ll definitely get someone to look for you.”

Qiao Nian looked at Su Yan with heartache. Only then did she realize that her mother still couldn’t believe that all of this was real. She thought that this was a dream.

Previously, she had heard from her brother that when her mother was in An City, she could not help but think of her. Every time she thought of her, she would fall into deep thought, as if she was dreaming.

In the past, she had thought that her mother only dreamed of her often. She didn’t expect her mother to be mentally confused.

When she lived in the Qiao family, she didn’t know that she was adopted by the Qiao family. Later on, she accidentally found out that she wasn’t a child of the Qiao family.

If she hadn’t helped Grandma and went to the MY auction, she might never have found her family for the rest of her life.

All these years, her mother had been blaming herself and in pain because of her kidnapping back then.

Qiao Nian didn’t know how her mother had survived all these years!

Qiao Nian wiped her tears with a tissue. She saw Su Yan looking at her intently, not saying a word.

“Sugar.” Su Yan smiled at Qiao Nian with tears in her eyes and said gently, “You’re as good-looking as I imagined.”

“When you were young, Old Lu and I told us that you would definitely be a devastatingly beautiful woman when you grew up. When the time came, we would let you marry Xiao Zhou. We believe that child Xiao Zhou will definitely treat you well.”

“I really didn’t expect all my wishes to be fulfilled in my dream. I’m really too happy!”

When Qiao Nian heard Su Yan’s words, tears streamed down her face. She held Su Yan’s hand tightly and said softly, “Mom, this isn’t a dream. I’m really still alive!”

Su Yan was slightly stunned.

Qiao Nian placed Su Yan’s hand on her wrist and said seriously, “Touch me. I have a pulse. You’re not dreaming. I’m really still alive!”

Su Yan felt her strong pulse. Her eyes gradually cleared, and tears streamed down her face. “Are you really still alive?”

“Mom, Sister is still alive. You’re not dreaming!” Lu Qi hurriedly said. “If you don’t believe me, you can pinch Big Brother. If he frowns, it means that you’re not dreaming!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

When Lu Zhu heard Lu Qi’s words, he glared daggers at her. “Mom, Sister is really too good at tricking people. I promise you that none of this is a dream.” Su Yan held Qiao Nian’s hand tightly and said anxiously, “Sugar, I’m sorry. It’s Mom’s fault. Mom thought that you were really gone, so she didn’t look for you. At that time, if Mom had looked for you, you definitely wouldn’t have suffered outside anymore.”

Qiao Nian was a little sad. She hadn’t expected her mother to think that everything was a dream.

Previously, Big Brother had said that as long as Mommy thought of her, her mind would be a little unstable.

“Come, let Mom take a good look at you.” Su Yan stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian. She noticed Qiao Nian’s thin wrist and frowned. “Why are you so thin? Did you eat badly?”

“Mom, actually, I’ve gained a few kilograms. I’m not skinny anymore!” Qiao Nian smiled at Su Yan.

“You’re as obedient as you were when you were young.” At the thought of this, Su Yan felt even worse. She said, “If I had gotten someone to look for you back then, we might have met sooner.”

“Mom, this isn’t your fault. It’s all the fault of the people who kidnapped me back then.” At this point, Qiao Nian recalled that Song Man had once used an arm to replace her. She continued, “Those people hid the truth. How can you be blamed? I think I’m already very happy to find my family..”
