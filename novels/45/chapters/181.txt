Chapter 182 Caught in the Act

Qiao Shan enjoyed very much the air of ceremony Qiao Nian had created. He greeted Gu Zhou calmly and led everyone to the door.

Qiao Shan stood tall and straight in front of the door, his vanity soaring. He placed the key card on the door lock.

Click!

The door opened.

Indescribable noises came from inside the room.

A woman’s excited screams. A man’s beast-like roars. The sounds of slapping rose and fell, creating a discordant harmony.

Even if none of them could see what was going on inside, they could all imagine how frenzied the two people in the room were being.

Everyone flushed. Just as Qiao Shan was about to retreat, he heard the woman scream again. He stopped in his tracks.

This voice clearly belonged to Su Xue.

Qiao Shan’s feet seemed to have been nailed to the ground. His face flushed bright red, and his temples throbbed viciously, veins bulging on his forehead. His hands were clenched into tight fists. His mind had gone completely blank.

Blushing, Qiao Xin took two steps out of the room. Seeing that Qiao Shan was still standing there in a daze, she whispered, “Did we get the wrong room key? Let’s go out first. Don’t disturb them!”

Only then did Qiao Shan come back to his senses. He wanted to rush in and drag Su Xue out, but his rationality told him that he couldn’t let Qiao Xin know about the despicable things Su Xue had done. After all, Su Xue was her mother. He began to chase Qiao Xin out of the room.

How could Qiao Nian let go of such a good opportunity? Pretending to be confused, she said, “Dad, the voice inside seems to be Mom?”

Qiao Nian had painstakingly prepared so much. Of course, she had to let the show continue!

Although Qiao Nian’s voice wasn’t loud, it silenced the two people in the room.

Qiao Shan glared daggers at Qiao Nian.

Qiao Xin frowned and said unhappily, “Qiao Nian, you’ve gone too far. Are you crazy? How can you slander Mom?”

Qiao Nian pretended not to understand. She quickly stepped forward and pulled open the white curtains by the bed.

“Ah!”

The woman on the bed screamed and burrowed under the blanket in a frenzy.

Qiu Nan took a while longer to react. When he saw a group of people in the room, his expression changed. He hurriedly pulled the blanket over his head.

There were clothes scattered on the floor around the bed, and everything was in a mess. There were even some unidentifiable liquids on the blankets. It was clear what Su Xue and Qiu Nan were doing.

Qiao Nian took two steps back.

Gu Zhou gave Chen Qing a look.

Understanding immediately, Chen Qing walked over and lifted the blanket off the bed.

“Ah!!”

As Su Xue screamed, two naked bodies were exposed just like that.

When Su Xue saw how irate Qiao Shan was, she felt as if she had been struck by lightning. She collapsed onto the bed, her mind in a mess.

Oh my god!

It was over!

Everything was over!

She was sure she had done everything with utmost discretion. How did Qiao Shan still find out that she was having an affair?

Su Xue hurriedly covered her face with her hair.

As for Qiu Nan, he had already wet himself in fear.

Qiao Xin looked at the scene on the bed in disbelief. She had never expected her mother to be such a person.

How would she and her brother live their lives in the future?

Qiao Xin’s stomach churned. She quickly walked towards the bathroom and threw up. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Gu Zhou lowered his gaze indifferently and turned to look out of the French window. He did not want those dirty things to taint his eyes.

Qiao Nian put on an astonished expression. Her lips curved up slightly. “You were so passionate!”

Qiao Shan had no time to bother with Qiao Nian. He glared daggers at Su Xue. Just now, when he only heard the voice, he had still managed to retain some rational thought. Now, however, all he could feel was rage.

Qiao Shan rolled up his sleeve, raised his fist, and threw a punch at Su Xue’s face.

“B*tch, I’ve treated you well. How dare you fool around with someone else? You made me a cuckold, you worthless wretch!”
