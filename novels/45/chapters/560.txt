Gu Zhou was speechless.

Qiao Nian seemed to have thought of something. She gasped and asked, “Don’t tell me she’s using a fake identity!”

The more Qiao Nian thought about it, the more she felt that this was possible. It was just like how small hospitals wouldn’t check one’s identity at all. She pursed her lips and sighed. “Then did she give the child to Gu Qi’s father directly after giving birth?”

She noticed that Gu Zhou’s expression was getting uglier and uglier. She sighed helplessly. “Could it be…”

“There’s no information or any news.” Gu Zhou interrupted Qiao Nian’s thoughts and said indifferently, “You’re a little talkative today. Why don’t you go back and rest?”

Gu Zhou looked at Gu Qi, who was lying on the bed. He wanted to spend time with Gu Qi.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips and said, “Can I stay with him for a while?”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Qi’s face. At this moment, there was a smile on his face that wasn’t there usually. He seemed to be having a sweet dream.

Or perhaps, he had found his mommy in his dream.

Qiao Nian felt a lump in her throat. She reached out to cover Gu Qi with the blanket.

If he woke up and found that he still hadn’t found his mother, how sad would he be?

At the thought of this, her heart clenched involuntarily.

The Gu family was very capable. Neither Gu Zhou nor Gu Qi’s father had found Gu Qi’s mother, which meant one thing.

Firstly, someone had deliberately hidden Gu Qi’s mother and was unwilling to let anyone find her.

Secondly, Gu Qi’s mother had the ability to hide herself from others.

Either way, this news was not good news for Gu Qi.

Qiao Nian thought about how someone who had the ability to erase the past of a pregnant woman was definitely not an ordinary person.

Qiao Nian took out her phone and sent a message to Old A.

“Investigate a woman who abandoned her child before marriage. Moreover, the father of the child doesn’t know that the woman gave birth.”

When Old A saw this message, he was stunned. Why was this sentence so long and winding?

“Are you looking for a woman who has secretly given birth to a man’s child?”

“Yes, the child should be about five years old.”

“Alright, I’ll go investigate.”

After Qiao Nian finished contacting Old A, she sent another message to the director of the appraisal institute.

“Did anyone compare the DNA samples of the child I sent over previously to his?”

“Half an hour ago, a lady brought a sample over for a comparison.”

At this, Qiao Nian’s eyelids twitched. Her heart jumped to her throat. She hurriedly asked, “Who is she?”

“I’m really sorry. It’s not convenient for us to reveal the identities of the relatives now.”

In this world, there was no such thing as coincidence. The person who would compare the sample to that child at this time should be someone close to her.

Previously, Jiang Yue had provoked her and said some nonsense. Could it be Jiang Yue?

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian found Jiang Yue’s photo on her phone and sent it over. She asked, “Is it her? Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone that you told me.”

The other party hesitated for a moment before giving an affirmative answer.

After Qiao Nian read the message, her face darkened. Her eyes were filled with anger, and she regretted not slapping Jiang Yue a few more times!

However, how did Jiang Yue know that Gu Qi’s DNA was there?

Could it be that Jiang Yue had followed Gu Zhou before, and Gu Zhou had also placed Gu Qi’s DNA sample in that laboratory for testing?

That made sense. That DNA lab was the largest in An City. How could someone like Gu Zhou find a lousy lab to do a DNA test on Gu Qi?

It seemed that Jiang Yue felt that Gu Qi was Gu Zhou’s illegitimate son. Hence, she had returned to the villa this time to obtain evidence before going to the appraisal office to verify her suspicions.

If she hadn’t asked Gu Zhou today, she might have really fallen for Jiang Yue’s trick.

For some reason, Jiang Yue’s voice suddenly rang in her ears.

“What do you think everyone will think if they find out that you have an illegitimate child?”
