In an instant, all the blood drained from Qiao Xin’s face. Her legs trembled uncontrollably as her weight fell on Su Yan. Without his presence, she might have collapsed to

the ground.

Director Lin placed a hand over his heart, trying hard to calm himself down. He was genuinely afraid that he would faint from the shock.

At this moment, Director Lin suddenly understood why his usually composed assistant had been so flustered.

However, what shocked Director Lin even more was that the five pots of Suranne Grass were just the beginning. The gifts that followed almost caused Director Lin to faint

from suffocation.

Goodness, this was Moonlight Grass!

These pots of Moonlight Grass had even bore fruit!

One stalk of Moonlight Grass was worth tens of millions. Moreover, Moonlight Grass that had bore fruit was even rarer and more valuable than Suranne Grass!

When everything had been carried in, the onlookers began to count the items one by one in childish excitement. It was as if they had all reverted to kindergarteners.

Five pots of Suranne Grass, six pots of Moonlight Grass, and twelve ripe Moonlight Fruits.

Each ripe Moonlight Fruit was worth more than a hundred million.

Director Lin was almost knocked out. He moved his arm in front of Lin Tao and said excitedly, “Quick, pinch me!”

A gleeful smile appeared on Lin Tao’s face. Not holding back, she pinched Director Lin’s arm hard.

“Oh, that hurts! So everything is true!” Director Lin looked at the items in utter disbelief. He was afraid that he would faint from excitement. He was breathing so heavily

that he wondered, momentarily, if an inhaler was necessary to assist his breathing.

Qiao Xin looked at the five pots of Suranne Grass, neatly arranged in a row, and her breathing grew more and more erratic.

She had initially thought that Qiao Nian was just going to hide the other pots of Suranne Grass she had seen, but she had never expected Qiao Nian to give all of them to

Director Lin.

Was Qiao Nian a fool?

Those pots of Moonlight Grass shouldn’t have been sent by Qiao Nian, right?

Qiao Xin remembered that there were no pots of Moonlight Grass in the van at the mental hospital that day.

That’s right. These definitely weren’t sent over by Qiao Nian!

If Qiao Nian was so rich, why had she still stayed in the mental hospital, subjecting herself to suffering? It couldn’t be true.

Director Lin’s assistant stood at the side, looking excited. His voice trembled as he said, “Director Lin, we’ve already moved in all of Miss Qiao Nian’s gifts!”

Everyone’s legs gave way. The shock had left them all in a frenzied state of mind, a thousand thoughts buzzing about. They all wanted to kneel down and apologize to Qiao

Nian!

Director Lin’s legs gave way as well. If Lin Tao hadn’t been supporting him, he might have fallen to his knees!

He had always known that Qiao Nian was very talented at cultivating plants, but he had never expected Qiao Nian to have spent these past few years preparing such a big

gift for him!

This was truly a great surprise! Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

At this moment, Su Yan was also stunned. He had never expected Qiao Nian to be the one who had delivered these items.

He was from the medical field, so he was naturally aware of the value of these items. These plants were truly priceless. Most wouldn’t be able to ever own one in their lives,

even if they were to run through their entire fortunes.

But these gifts had been sent over by Qiao Nian, whom he despised the most.

What shocked Su Yan the most was that Qiao Nian had probably cultivated these plants herself.

Su Yan felt his face burn with shame, as if he had just been slapped.

As for the others, they looked at the Moonlight Grass and Suranne Grass in disbelief.

“Goodness! I’m actually able to see real Moonlight Grass bearing fruit with my own eyes!”

“Our lives have truly not been in vain. Yet, we were blind to not recognize a giant among us. We misunderstood Miss Qiao Nian, and actually believed the words of that

despicable Qiao Xin!”

“Miss Qiao Nian is truly a genius. One can only dream of getting anywhere near her level!”

Listening to the praises the others were heaping upon Qiao Nian, Song Hua clenched his fists tightly. His heart skipped a beat.

He had stood on Qiao Xin’s side today. Because of this matter, the good reputation he had been building up for decades was ruined, just like that.

Song Hua glared viciously at the Moonlight Grass and Suranne Grass. He had never expected Qiao Nian to be so generous!

She had gifted so much to Director Lin at once!

At the thought of this, Song Hua felt certain that Qiao Nian had other treasures in her possession!.
