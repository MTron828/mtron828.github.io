Chapter 17: What a Pervert

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian was not used to being treated with such enthusiasm, and found herself quite overwhelmed.

Holding onto Qiao Nian’s hand, Matriarch Gu began walking into the house. Her gaze landed on Qiao Nian’s face and she spoke gently, as if she was afraid of scaring Qiao Nian. “My darling child, how old are you this year?”

“Twenty-four.”

“Good, good!” The smile on Matriarch Gu’s face grew even brighter. “You’re a good girl!”

Qiao Nian grew even more confused. All she had done was answer Matriarch Gu’s question about her age. Just for that, she was called a “good girl”?

“Oh!” Matriarch Gu suddenly exclaimed.

Startled, Qiao Nian froze.

“Lan is on your arm! This little pet is extremely intelligent. It likes those who are kind-hearted.” Matriarch Gu’s smile was so wide, it seemed as if her face was about to split in half. She looked at Qiao Nian lovingly. “It seems that my darling granddaughter must be a very kind angel. That’s why Lan is following you around!”

Qiao Nian smiled awkwardly. What should she say? Thank you?

Matriarch Gu did not sense the awkwardness at all. She felt that her dear granddaughter must have sent by the heavens to rescue her grandson. Her eyes sparkled as she asked, “I heard that your younger sister bullied you?”

Qiao Nian lowered her head and smiled faintly, remaining quiet.

“Good girl. If anyone bullies you in the future, you have to tell me. Grandma will stand up for you!” At this point, Matriarch Gu finally remembered her purpose of coming here. She said to Butler Zhao, “Don’t just stand there. Quickly move Nian Nian’s things to Second Young Master’s room!”

Butler Zhao was stunned.

Second Young Master was a clean freak. If Second Young Master found out that Second Young Madam’s things were in his room, would he lose his temper and order them to renovate his entire bedroom?

“Why aren’t you going?” Matriarch Gu narrowed her eyes, displeased.

Butler Zhao could only brace herself and carry out the command. Privately, she prayed that Second Young Master would not fly into a rage that night.

…

When night fell, Qiao Nian was still reading in the guest room.

Matriarch Gu was sitting by her side, so sleepy that her eyelids kept sliding shut. She didn’t want to disrupt Qiao Nian’s reading, so she got up and walked outside. Once outside, she took out her phone to call Gu Zhou, urging him to return home early.

When Gu Zhou returned, Matriarch Gu was already so tired that she was practically in tears. Seeing his grandmother in that state, Gu Zhou frowned slightly and gave Butler Zhao a cold glance, as if blaming her for not taking good care of Matriarch Gu.

Butler Zhao hurriedly lowered her head in fear, not daring to speak.

“Don’t blame her.” Matriarch Gu spoke up first. She walked up to Gu Zhou and asked in a low voice, “My darling child has been married into our family for quite a few days. Why haven’t you been taking good care of her? Why haven’t you consummated your marriage?” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Startled, Gu Zhou stood there with confusion written all over his face.

Could it be that Grandma was referring to Qiao Nian?

Since when did Grandma become so close with Qiao Nian?

However, Gu Zhou chose to continue pretending to be in the dark. He asked, “Who is your ‘darling child’?”

“Your wife, of course!” Matriarch Gu glared daggers at Gu Zhou, saying resentfully, “I’ve already asked someone to move my darling child’s things into your room. You’re a man, so you have to take the initiative. Otherwise, your wife will run away!”

Gu Zhou’s expression darkened.

“I’m talking to you. Are you listening to me?” Matriarch Gu spoke without a trace of humor. She was only satisfied when she saw Gu Zhou turn to look at her. “Alright, I’ll say no more. You youngsters have fun at night!”

With that, Matriarch Gu left with Butler Zhao.

Seeing that the lights in Qiao Nian’s room were still on, Gu Zhou walked over.

The moment Gu Zhou entered the room, his eyes met Qiao Nian’s glittering ones. He narrowed his eyes and commanded, “Sleep in my room!”

Qiao Nian closed the book on medicine in her hands and replied, “No, I’m fine here. Ah…”

Qiao Nian had never expected for Gu Zhou to walk over and pick her up in his arms in a bridal carry. Caught off-balance, she looked toward Gu Zhou in shock and unintentionally met those soul-stirring eyes. She pursed her lips slightly and said, “Put me down!”

“Sleep in my room tonight!”

With those words, Gu Zhou carried Qiao Nian back to his room.

Not far away, Matriarch Gu poked her head out sneakily. She watched as Qiao Nian was carried into the room by Gu Zhou and couldn’t help but smile. Carefully, she tiptoed to Gu Zhou’s bedroom door.

The door to Gu Zhou’s room was tightly shut. Matriarch Gu pressed her ear against the door.

“You…”

Before Qiao Nian could finish speaking, Gu Zhou placed a hand over her mouth.

“Shh!” Gu Zhou pressed Qiao Nian under him and gazed into her eyes. His eyes dimmed. With a low voice, he asked hoarsely, “Do you know how to scream?”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion and blinked.

Gu Zhou reached out pinched Qiao Nian’s arm hard.

“Ah!”

Gu Zhou let go and Qiao Nian gave a shout of pain. He immediately placed a hand over her mouth.

“Oh…” Qiao Nian glared daggers at Gu Zhou.. She had never expected this man to be a sadomasochist. What a pervert!
