Chapter 1848 - 1848: Fake Death Medicine

Qiao Nian’s tone gradually turned cold. She glanced at Old Master Qin beside her. “That person’s medical skills are about the same as Master’s. Even under such circumstances, the chances of saving her are only 30%.”

“30%?” Lina’s voice trembled. That meant that there was a seventy percent chance that person would die.

At this moment, Gu Zhou’s cold voice rang out from the side. “Whether Madam Song Ling is alive or dead is an unsolved mystery. We’ll set her status as alive for the time being, but we have to investigate the kidnapping twenty-one years ago from other angles.”

Everyone turned to look at Shen Mei, who had been sitting silently in the middle of the sofa.

Worried that Shen Mei would be nervous and afraid, Lina hurriedly held her hand.

Shen Mei was not nervous at this moment, because other than Old Master Qin, everyone else in the room was very familiar.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Shen Mei’s face. She asked with concern, “Madam

President, are you a little tired from coming here from Europe? Why don’t I examine your body first?”

When Shen Mei heard Qiao Nian’s words, she revealed a pale and weak expression. She smiled and said, “Nian Nian, I’m fine. Thank you.”

Qiao Nian hadn’t expected Shen Mei to take off her mask. In the past, Shen Mei had been very afraid of others.

“Mom.” Lina looked at Shen Mei worriedly.

Shen Mei knew what Lina was thinking. She gently patted Shen Mei’s hand and said with a smile, “Mom used to teach you that a drop of kindness is repaid with a spring. Nian Nian and the others have helped us so much. We have to work hard to help them.”Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Seeing that Lina still wanted to say something, Shen Mei smiled and said, “I’m willing to give up my life.”

When Qiao Nian heard this, she instantly became nervous. She hurriedly said,

“Madam, don’t say that. We won’t put you in any danger.”

“Although we really want to investigate what happened back then, you’re Lina’s mother. I’m already extremely grateful that you’re willing to come to An City to help us. It’s mutually beneficial between us. I don’t want you to be in danger.” Qiao Nian really treated Lina as her good friend. Even if Shen Mei was someone else, they couldn’t use her life to investigate the truth from more than twenty years ago.

Shen Mei naturally understood Qiao Nian’s words. The smile on her face was warm and gentle. “Yes, thank you.”

Gu Zhou smiled at Qiao Nian and held her hand, as if comforting her. Qiao Nian looked at everyone present and said, “Our goal is to remind you of the kidnapping twenty years ago and who you met at that time.”

When Shen Mei heard Qiao Nian’s words, her eyelashes slowly lowered. She said in a low voice, “B-but there’s something wrong with my brain.”

She was a little worried that she might not be able to help Qiao Nian and the others.

Lina understood what Shen Mei meant. She hugged Shen Mei and said in a low voice, “Mom, there’s nothing wrong with your brain. The reason why you’ve forgotten many things now is because you’re sick. As long as you’re cured, there won’t be a problem.”

Seeing Shen Mei like this, Qiao Nian turned to look at Gu Zhou.

She knew Shen Mei’s current situation and knew very well that Shen Mei might not remember the kidnapping incident clearly, but she still wanted Shen Mei to recall what had happened before. She was clearly making things difficult for her…

Old Master Qin, who had been sitting at the side, stood up and sat down on the other side of Shen Mei.

When Shen Mei saw Old Master Qin, she couldn’t help but feel nervous.

Lina hurriedly comforted her in a low voice. “Mom, don’t worry. Grandpa Qin won’t hurt you.”

Shen Mei recalled that Qiao Nian had just said that Old Master Qin was Qiao Nian’s grandfather. Only then did she heave a sigh of relief.

“Madam President, let me take your pulse,” Old Master Qin said concisely.

Shen Mei handed her hand over.

Through Shen Mei’s sleeve, Old Master Qin’s slender fingers rested on her wrist.

Qiao Nian immediately sat up straight and looked at Old Master Qin nervously. Her grandfather’s medical skills were even better than hers. Perhaps her grandfather could really make Madam President recover..
