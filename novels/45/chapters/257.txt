Chapter 258: Jealous of Her?

When Wang Xuan heard Gao Lin’s words, she almost vomited. She rolled her eyes at Gao Lin and said angrily, “The reason why idiots become idiots is because there’s something wrong with their brains. I think if Mr. Dong Hua knew that a rat like you would join his team, he would probably have packed his luggage and boarded the plane long ago!”

Gao Lin’s face was livid. She walked up to Wang Xuan angrily and raised her hand to slap her.

“Yes, hit me now!” Wang Xuan raised her head high, not afraid of Gao Lin at all. She said, “I’ll just stand there and not move. Hit me however you want. As long as you dare to hit me, I believe that the news of Senior Xia Xue’s music assistant hitting someone will immediately become a trending topic on Weibo. I wonder if Mr. Dong Hua still wants Senior Xia Xue as a female musician.”

Gao Lin was so angry that her face turned pale. She raised her hand in the air awkwardly, refusing to hit her. In the end, she retracted it angrily and raised her eyebrow. “You’re just jealous of me!”

“Yes, yes, that’s right. I’m jealous of you. Then you have to perform well so that I’ll continue to be jealous!” Wang Xuan looked at Gao Lin with a smile and made a face. Gao Lin was so angry that she almost exploded on the spot!

Gao Lin bit her lip. If she didn’t care about Sister Xia Xue’s reputation, she would have gone up to tear Wang Xuan’s mouth apart.

Wang Xuan, this b*tch. When she was with Qiao Nian, she would just run her mouth. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Gao Lin took a deep breath and let it go. She would not stoop to the level of these two clowns. She was on a completely different level from them now. When she met Mr. Dong Hua in the future, she would definitely perform well in front of him.

When she got along well with Mr. Dong Hua in the future, she would become a famous musician. At that time, she would be able to use her connections to directly suppress Qiao Nian and Wang Xuan, cutting off their future in music.

Thinking of this, Gao Lin felt much better.

Suppressing her anger for the time being, Gao Lin smiled at Qiao Nian and Wang Xuan. “Thank you for your kind words!”

With that, Gao Lin turned around and left in her high heels.

Qiao Nian had also finished packing up her violin. She took Wang Xuan’s hand and said, “Come to my house for lunch today!”

Wang Xuan smiled and nodded. She left with Qiao Nian.

Gao Lin watched as the two of them left. Her expression darkened as she cursed. “A country bumpkin and an orphan. I wonder what these two are showing off for!”

Seeing that Gao Lin couldn’t stand Qiao Nian and Wang Xuan, Chen Xue stepped forward and said, “Gao Lin, don’t be angry. What’s there to be angry about with the two of them? Don’t ruin your health by getting angry! They won’t be able to cause any trouble in the future!”

When Gao Lin heard Chen Xue’s words, she felt much better. “You’re right, Chen Xue. You’re the best. Don’t worry, I won’t mistreat you in the future!”

Qiao Nian and Wang Xuan walked to the door. When Qiao Nian heard their words, she felt nauseous. She was so disgusted that she couldn’t speak.

There was no friendship between Gao Lin and Chen Xue. One was vain, while the other wanted benefits. The two of them just wanted what they needed.

Now that Gao Lin was in a high position, Chen Xue was her supporter. If Gao Lin fell, Chen Xue would be the first to attack her.

After the two of them walked outside, Wang Xuan took a deep breath of fresh air and said, “The air outside is still fresher. Those people inside are really too disgusting!”

“Let’s ignore them!” Qiao Nian said with a smile.

“Yes!” Wang Xuan had always been too lazy to bother with young ladies from rich families. All of them were extremely delicate, and all of them were mentally ill.

“I was on the phone with Grandma just now. You heard everything, right?”

“Yes.” Wang Xuan nodded. Suddenly, she seemed to have thought of something and frowned slightly. “This is the first time I’ve been to your house. It doesn’t seem right for me to go empty-handed. Come with me to buy some things later!”

Qiao Nian shook her head in disapproval. “You don’t have to think too much about it. Grandma doesn’t lack anything. As long as you go, she’ll be very happy.”

Wang Xuan was also a straightforward person. She nodded and said, “Okay!”

When the two of them walked to the school gate, they saw a particularly luxurious Bentley parked at the school gate.
