Chapter 296: Holding a Grandchild?

When Jiang Yue heard Gu Zhou’s voice, she came back to her senses. She bit her lip and said after a long while, “Grandma, Grandma wants you to go over.”

Jiang Yue’s voice trembled.

“Ok.”

Gu Zhou stood up and walked upstairs. He brushed past Jiang Yue, not even sparing her a glance.

Jiang Yue was deeply hurt. She tried hard to calm herself down and clenched her fists. Only then did she look at Qiao Nian and greet her. “Second Sister-in-law!”

Qiao Nian nodded slightly in greeting. She recalled that Grandma had been eating the medicinal cuisine she had made recently, and asked, “How is Grandma feeling today?”

Jiang Yue thought for a while and said, “Grandma likes to sleep recently. Nothing else.”

When Qiao Nian heard Jiang Yue’s words, she nodded slightly and agreed. “Okay.”

With that, Qiao Nian prepared to go upstairs, but Jiang Yue stopped her.

“Second Sister-in-law!”

Qiao Nian looked at Jiang Yue and asked in confusion, “Is there anything else?”

A trace of hesitation flashed in Jiang Yue’s eyes. After a long while, she asked softly, “Second Sister-in-law, do you like children?”

Qiao Nian didn’t expect Jiang Yue to ask this question. She frowned slightly and asked, “Why are you asking this?”

Did Gu Zhou have an illegitimate child?

A trace of cunning flashed in Jiang Yue’s eyes. She smiled lightly and pretended not to care. “Second Sister-in-law, I was just asking. I was just curious. Since you and Brother Ah Zhou have such a close relationship, when do you plan to have a child?”

Qiao Nian looked at Jiang Yue’s insincere expression. She felt that there was definitely something more to Jiang Yue’s words, but she couldn’t figure it out. She said casually, “This matter will be decided by him!”

When Jiang Yue heard Qiao Nian’s words, she was slightly stunned. She said in shock, “Are you already prepared to give birth to Brother Ah Zhou’s child?”

Qiao Nian didn’t have much patience to begin with. Seeing that Jiang Yue kept bringing up something unimportant, she frowned.

This would remind her of the dead child. For her, the memory of that child would always be painful.

“Why are you asking these questions?”

When Jiang Yue heard Qiao Nian’s question, she said meaningfully, “I just want to know when Grandma will be able to carry your child with Brother Ah Zhou.”

Although Qiao Nian had been looking for an opportunity to leave the Gu family, she didn’t want Jiang Yue to have an easy time either. Hence, she smiled casually and said, “Since Grandma wants to have a grandchild, we can do so anytime. There’s no time like the present. Let’s do it tonight. My husband and I will bring up the plan to have a grandchild!”

Jiang Yue’s expression darkened.

“Since Mrs. Gu has said so, I naturally won’t refuse.”

This voice…

Qiao Nian and Jiang Yue looked up and saw Gu Zhou standing on the stairs in a well-tailored suit.

Jiang Yue’s heart skipped a beat, and her face turned pale. She hurriedly lowered her gaze to hide the panic in her eyes.

She didn’t know when Brother Ah Zhou had appeared or how much he had heard. She muttered, “Brother Ah Zhou…”

Qiao Nian felt a little awkward as well. Her breathing quickened. When she thought of how Gu Zhou had forcefully kissed her just now, she couldn’t help but swallow.

Couldn’t Gu Zhou tell that she was angry at Jiang Yue?

And he had agreed so cooperatively?

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but blush.

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on Jiang Yue’s face, and his eyes instantly turned cold. He said in a low voice, “Come with me.”

With that, Gu Zhou walked towards the study on the second floor without looking back, exuding a cold aura.

Jiang Yue answered carefully, not daring to speak further. She followed behind Gu Zhou in fear.

What should she do?

He had heard everything.

Oh my god!

It was over.

Jiang Yue’s mind raced, and she clenched her fists tightly. Her palms were covered in cold sweat, and she suddenly felt suffocated.
