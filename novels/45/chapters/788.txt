789 Gu Chuan?

She had been tricked into being with another man.

She had never expected to be pregnant.

It was fine if she was pregnant. If those two children could survive, she could be fine alone with the children!

However, both children were gone! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

If she brought up one single matter, they might be able to get through it if they worked hard.

But how could he accept all of this combined?

Back then, she had suppressed a large portion of her painful memories because she was in too much pain.

Just as Qiao Nian was immersed in the past, she suddenly felt a bite on her ear. She immediately came back to her senses, and her face turned red involuntarily.

“Nian’er.” Gu Zhou’s voice was hoarse and seductive. “We’ve met many times in the past. Don’t you know?”

When Qiao Nian heard his voice, her entire body stiffened. She looked at the person in front of her in disbelief.

“Gu Chuan.”

Qiao Nian murmured.

“It’s me!” He lowered his head and looked at Qiao Nian intently, pursing his lips. “Gu Chuan is also me!”

Qiao Nian blinked in confusion, her face filled with disbelief.

Had Gu Zhou and Gu Chuan fused?

In the past, Qiao Nian had heard from others that if one personality disappeared, the main personality would forget what had happened to the other personalities.

But Gu Zhou seemed to be different. He actually still remembered what Gu Chuan’s personality had experienced.

Although Gu Zhou was hugging her the same way as Gu Chuan, Gu Chuan was not so gentle.

Gu Chuan was domineering and would not allow her to leave him.

“Gu… Gu Zhou.”

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face. As soon as she finished speaking, she saw Gu Zhou shake his head.

Could it be that she had used the wrong name?

“Gu Chuan?”

“No!” Gu Zhou pressed his forehead against Qiao Nian’s. He looked into her eyes intently, his low and hoarse voice domineering. “We’re married.”

Qiao Nian blinked in confusion, not understanding what Gu Zhou meant.

“Call me Hubby!”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, her body instantly tensed up, and her face turned red uncontrollably.

This…

She was too shy!

Qiao Nian wanted to stay away from Gu Zhou, but Gu Zhou was pressing down on her. She couldn’t move at all.

Qiao Nian hurriedly changed the topic and asked, “Previously, you said that I had forgotten something. I’ve never remembered. What exactly have I forgotten?”

Gu Zhou pursed his lips slightly. Seeing how serious she was, he knew in his heart that she really couldn’t remember anything.

He thought for a moment and reminded her, “On the spiritual mountain.”

“Huh?” Qiao Nian blinked in confusion.

She used to live on the spiritual mountain with her grandfather and senior brothers.

How did Gu Zhou know?

Could it be that Gu Zhou had also been to Spirited Mountain?

If he went to Spirited Mountain, she should remember someone like Gu Zhou.

Why did she never remember this person?

She trusted her memory very much. Even when she was two or three years old, her memories would still appear in her dreams. If that was the case, why hadn’t she seen Gu Zhou in her dreams?

Qiao Nian pondered for a while, trying hard to recall her past memories.

Indeed, she had never seen such a handsome man like Gu Zhou on Spirited Mountain.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian’s face and couldn’t help but fall into deep thought.

When he found out that Gu Chuan’s personality existed, some other memories suddenly appeared in his mind.

Those memories appeared out of thin air.

In the past, he had always felt that he had forgotten something important, but when he had Gu Chuan’s memories, he remembered.

Everything he had forgotten was related to her.

All Gu Chuan’s memories were of her!

Gu Zhou looked down at Qiao Nian and reminded her, “You told me in the past that you would repay me for saving your life.”

Qiao Nian’s beautiful fox-like eyes widened involuntarily.

Gu Chuan had said something similar.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou. Gu Zhou looked very normal. He shouldn’t be lying.

If Gu Chuan was spouting nonsense, then Gu Zhou must have said that because he had seen Gu Chuan’s memories. That was why he was certain that he had saved her before.
