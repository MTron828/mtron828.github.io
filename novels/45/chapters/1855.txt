Chapter 1856: Family?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Shen Mei seemed to have had a long dream. In the dream, she was suffering from cerebral palsy. Many things had happened to her. She felt so tired. When she woke up, she saw Lina and Qiao Nian guarding her bed.

“Mom!” When Lina saw that Shen Mei had woken up, she hurriedly pounced on her. “How do you feel? Are you feeling unwell?”

“I’m fine now.” With that, Shen Mei looked at Qiao Nian, who was sitting at the side, and said with a smile, “Thank you, Nian Nian. If you and your grandfather hadn’t helped me, I might never have recovered for the rest of my life.”

Qiao Nian smiled and shook her head. “Madam President, don’t say that. This is what we should do.”

Shen Mei sat up and her gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. She smiled and said, “Nian Nian, I had a long dream previously. I remember a little about the kidnapping twenty years ago. I wonder if it will help you.”

Qiao Nian had only wanted to hear from Shen Mei herself that she didn’t remember the kidnapping case. She didn’t expect there to be a pleasant surprise. Suppressing the joy in her heart, she nodded and said, “Madam President, please speak.”

“I seem to remember being tied up in a small room. No one came to visit me.” As Shen Mei spoke, she gradually fell into deep thought.

At that time, Shen Mei was locked in a small room. The windows here were very high, so she couldn’t see what was going on outside at all. Coupled with the fact that her mind wasn’t quite clear, she didn’t think of escaping. She just cried for her father.

Later on, a man walked in. The man walked up to her and comforted her. He even let her go. Later on, she seemed to have heard others call him “Liu Yu”.

After that, Shen Mei was sent to Europe and met the President of Europe.

As for what happened during Shen Mei’s kidnapping, she couldn’t remember at all.

“Madam, thank you so much. What you’re saying is very important to us.” Qiao Nian grabbed Shen Mei’s hand and said seriously.

Shen Mei frowned slightly and looked at Qiao Nian guiltily. “If only I hadn’t fallen ill back then. Then I could have helped you.”

Qiao Nian told Shen Mei about how she might have been hypnotized. It seemed that what Shen Mei remembered was all the memories of Uncle Liu Yu after he hypnotized her.

Perhaps those people had inadvertently called out “Liu Yu” after sending away the hypnotized Shen Mei, so Shen Mei only remembered this name.

After thanking Madam President, Qiao Nian left first because she had other things to do.

Qiao Nian was now completely certain that her Martial Uncle, Liu Yu, must know about the kidnapping more than twenty years ago.

At night, Qiao Nian received a call from her eldest brother, asking her to return to the Lu family. When she arrived, she saw that her eldest brother, second brother, fourth brother, and Song Yu were all waiting for her in the study.

Lu Zhu’s gaze swept across everyone present. Finally, his gaze paused on Song

Yu’s face before he said, “Song Yu, I’ve found your family.”

Song Yu’s expression did not change. “Is it Song Xue? Did you get any useful information from her?”

Lu Zhu shook his head and continued, “I’m not talking about Song Xue, but T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Auntie Cao. She’s related to you by blood. You should be family.”

As Lu Zhu spoke, he handed a copy of Auntie Cao and Song Yu’s DNA test reports to Song Yu.

Song Yu was stunned. She sat rooted to the ground in disbelief. She did not take the report immediately.

Qiao Nian took the report from Lu Zhu and glanced at its contents before handing it to Song Yu.

Song Yu took the report shakily. The person who treated her the best in the entire Lu family was Auntie Cao. She couldn’t believe that she was actually related to Auntie Cao by blood.

Song Yu took a deep breath and flipped open the report. When she saw the contents clearly, her face turned even paler.

“Why?” Song Yu frowned, her eyes filled with confusion. Her voice trembled slightly. “She’s clearly my family, and she treats me very well. She must know my identity. Then, they must have planned everything long ago, starting from when I begged on the streets and was picked up by Mom.”

Song Yu looked up at Lu Zhu, who was sitting opposite her.. “I remember Song

Xue also said that they sent me into the Lu family on purpose!”
