763 Soup

After that, Qiao Nian called the student who was studying under her.

After the call, Qiao Nian smiled at Gu Qi and Xiao He and asked, “It’s almost noon. What do you want to eat? I’ll go cook now!”

“Soup!”

“Meat!”

The two of them spoke in unison.

When the two of them sat together, Qiao Nian looked at their identical faces. Her heart melted at their cuteness.

She noticed that , she said that she wanted to drink soup, while Gu Qi said that he wanted to eat meat.

Qiao Nian knew what to do. She nodded and said, “The two of you can play at home. Don’t go out. I’ll go to the kitchen to cook now!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Gu Qi nodded obediently.

Gu Qi walked to the door and watched Qiao Nian go downstairs with his own eyes. Only then did he walk to Xiao Shi’s side.

“Xiao Shi, is there anything you want to eat? You can tell me directly. I’ll go downstairs and tell Auntie Nian Nian.” Gu Qi looked at Xiao Shi worriedly. He didn’t understand why Xiao Shi only drank soup. Meat was clearly more nutritious and delicious.

Moreover, she looked so thin . She definitely had to eat more meat to gain weight.

“I’ll just drink the soup.” Xiao Shi gave an obedient smile.

“Then what do you think of Auntie Nian Nian?” Gu Qi asked tentatively. He was a little worried that Xiao Shi was unwilling to eat meat because she didn’t like Auntie Nian Nian.

When she thought of how Qiao Nian had cut her nails just now, she felt very warm.

She still remembered the time when her mommy took the initiative to hug her. Her mommy’s hug was very warm, but it didn’t make her feel any warmer than Auntie Nian Nian’s.

Auntie Nian Nian was like the winter sun, warming her up.

“She’s very nice!”

Not only was Auntie Nian Nian gentle, but she was also methodical. After knowing her condition, she immediately helped her acknowledge her ancestors and even took the initiative to do a DNA test.

Moreover, Auntie Nian Nian was cooking for them now.

She had just arrived and could already eat Auntie Nian Nian’s cooking.

If only she could eat Mommy’s cooking too.

At the thought of this, the light in Xiao Shi’s eyes gradually dimmed.

If Mommy had two hands like a normal person, and if Mommy wasn’t sick, she should be able to eat the food Mommy had made for her.

If only Mommy could be healthy.

Xiao Shi lowered her head in disappointment.

Seeing Xiao Shi like this, Gu Qi was a little puzzled. He didn’t know how to comfort Xiao Shi and said, “Sister, why don’t we play a game together?”

When he first saw Xiao Shi, he thought that she was his younger brother. Later on, she changed her clothes and asked him to go out and wait for her.

Only then did he know that she was his younger sister.

When she heard Gu Qi’s voice, she looked up at him. She knew that he was worried about her, so she threw all the unhappiness in her heart to the back of her mind. She smiled brightly and nodded. “Okay!”

Hence, the two of them took out their phones and began to play games.

When Qiao Nian drove to the villa, she realized that there was a large supermarket not far away. It wouldn’t take more than five minutes to drive there.

She drove to the supermarket. After buying the ingredients, she carried them to the kitchen.

Qiao Nian washed the ribs absent-mindedly.

When she touched Xiao Shi’s hands, they were clearly hands that often worked. This meant that she often worked at home .

Since she had lived with her mother , why did she work so often?

Qiao Nian placed the washed ribs in the pot to stew, then stood at the side and waited.

Her heart was in a mess now. She had just found out that Gu Qi was Gu Zhou’s child, and now Gu Zhou had a daughter. There were too many surprises.

Actually, she was already 100% certain that Xiao Shi was Gu Zhou’s child. She had only done the paternity test so that no one could find any fault with her, and no one would question Xiao Shi’s identity.

When she first saw Gu Qi and Xiao He, she couldn’t help but think of her two children who had passed away.

If those two children were still alive, they would probably be the same age as them. At the thought of this, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but feel sad.
