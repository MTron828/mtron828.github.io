998 Forced Marriage?

Qiao Nian smiled and rubbed Xiao Shi’s head. She looked at Xiao Shi dotingly and said gently, “No!”

“Does that mean Mommy likes Daddy a lot?” Xiao Shi’s eyes were sparkling like the stars in the sky.

Qiao Nian really hadn’t expected to be tricked by her daughter. “Xiao Shi, have you finished your homework?”

She no longer wanted to talk to Xiao Shi about what had happened between her and Gu Zhou, because she couldn’t help but recall what had happened last night. The tips of her ears turned red.

She really hadn’t expected Gu Zhou, who usually looked so sickly, to last so long.

Her legs had gone weak then.

However, Gu Zhou still looked like he wanted more.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but suspect that Gu Zhou wasn’t afraid of women at all. If only Gu Zhou really was. Her body wouldn’t have been on the verge of falling apart last night.

“Mommy, I’m no longer a child. I understand everything!” Xiao Shi blinked her big eyes and asked pitifully, “Just now, Uncle said that he wanted to take Mommy away from here. Then will Brother and I no longer have Mommy’s child in the future?”

“No, how could Mommy bear to leave you? Your uncle was joking!” With that, Qiao Nian looked up at Lu Jiang, signaling for him to explain.

Lu Jiang coughed. Actually, when he found out that he had misunderstood Gu Zhou previously, his attitude towards him softened a lot.

However, before Lu Jiang could speak, Xiao Shi said, “Mommy, Daddy just told Brother and me that he wanted to hold a grand wedding for you. When that happens, Brother and I will be your little flower girl. Then, our family can live happily together!”

When Qiao Nian heard Xiao Shi’s words, she stole a glance at her, and her heart softened.

Ever since she had untied the knot in her heart, she had never thought of leaving Gu Zhou, nor had she thought of abandoning her two children.

Why was Gu Zhou still letting a child be a lobbyist?

She had worked hard to give birth to the two children.

At the mention of children, Qiao Nian frowned slightly. At that time, Qiao Xin had said that she had given birth to three children, but none of them had survived.

She had another child wandering outside?

Qiao Nian’s frown deepened. Her memories told her that she was indeed pregnant with triplets.

She had to investigate that child thoroughly.

If that child was still alive, she would definitely find him.

Xiao Shi saw Qiao Nian frowning. Thinking that Qiao Nian was unwilling to marry her father, she said pitifully, “Mommy, do you really not want us anymore?”

Seeing Qiao Nian frown, Lu Jiang subconsciously glared at Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou was really too blind. At this moment, shouldn’t Gu Zhou propose to his sister?

Lu Jiang really felt that Gu Zhou was insensible. He had wasted such a good opportunity.

“No, how is that possible?” Qiao Nian smiled.

“Mommy, do you not want to get married?” Xiao Shi tilted her head and asked seriously.

“No, we’ll talk about marriage later!” Qiao Nian only wanted to investigate everything now. If her last child was still alive, she hoped that her three children would be her flower girls and ring bearers on the wedding day. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian with a complicated expression, his eyes darkening. Did Qiao Nian still want to leave him?

“When will it be in the future?” Xiao Shi blinked in confusion. She was really worried that her perfect home would disappear.

It wasn’t easy for her to find her home.

She only hoped that her family could be together beautifully.

“Next year!” Qiao Nian said casually. Most things had already been made clear. Not only were her forces investigating what had happened back then, but the Lu and Gu families were also investigating. She believed that the truth would be revealed soon!

Only then did Xiao Shi heave a sigh of relief. She looked at Qiao Nian with a smile. In the past, she had heard from others that getting married was a very complicated matter and required a lot of preparation. It seemed that it wasn’t that Mommy wasn’t willing to marry her father, but that she wanted to prepare to get married first.

“Mommy, when the time comes, can you give me a younger brother and sister?” Xiao Shi looked at Qiao Nian expectantly, her eyes filled with smiles.
