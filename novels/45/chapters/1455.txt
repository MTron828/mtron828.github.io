1456 Poisoned

When Doctor Kate heard Dr. Ollie’s words, she said disapprovingly, “Dr. Ollie, acupuncture has no scientific basis to begin with. What’s wrong with me removing the needles? Moreover, the Seventh Princess’s condition is critical now. It has nothing to do with me removing the needles!”

Qiao Nian frowned and ignored Kate. Her gaze fell on Dr. Ollie’s face and she asked worriedly, “Dr. Ollie, how’s Lina now? Has her condition stabilized?”

Gu Zhou gave Chen Qing a look. Chen Qing immediately got someone to take Doctor Kate away.

Ollie looked around. There were many people around, and it wasn’t convenient for him to speak here. He pursed his lips and said, “Come with me.”

There was a small room beside the operating theater. Usually, when a doctor was tired, he would rest in it.

After Ollie entered and saw that there was no one else around, he said to Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian, “The Seventh Princess suddenly bled profusely. It should be related to Kate using the silver needles. However, the Seventh Princess’s coma has nothing to do with her bleeding profusely.”

Qiao Nian frowned slightly and looked at Ollie in confusion. “What?”

“I’ve just done a comprehensive test on the Seventh Princess. The results are here.” Ollie took out the slip from his pocket and handed it to Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou. “Her indicators are abnormal now. I think she’s poisoned.”

Gu Zhou took the form and handed it to Qiao Nian. Qiao Nian looked down at the contents of the form and frowned. “Poisoned?”

“Yes.” Professor Ollie glanced at the report in Qiao Nian’s hand and continued, “Fortunately, you pulled out the arrow early and immediately sealed the Seventh Princess’s bloodflow, so the poison didn’t spread in her body.”

Dr. Ollie paused for a moment and continued, “But Kate removed the silver needles from the Seventh Princess’s body. Her bleeding increased, and her blood flow accelerated. The poison began to spread. That’s why the Seventh Princess became unconscious.”

Qiao Nian gripped the report in her hand tightly. She finally understood why Wright had let them leave fearlessly back then. So this was the main reason.

Wright deliberately put on a show to save the damsel in distress, but they interrupted his plan.

They could save Lina’s life, but if Lina didn’t have the antidote, they would still turn around and beg him for it. At that time, Wright would control Lina, her, and Gu Zhou.

It seemed that Wright was quite smart, but he was not smart enough.

Seeing that Qiao Nian was staring at the report, Dr. Ollie continued, “I can maintain the condition of the Seventh Princess for twenty-four hours. If she still doesn’t have the antidote when the time comes, I’m afraid…”

Dr. Ollie didn’t finish his sentence. Qiao Nian understood.

If Lina didn’t have the antidote, she would be facing death.

Qiao Nian gripped the report in her hand tightly and lowered her head slightly. If it weren’t for her, Lina wouldn’t have been injured. She pursed her lips tightly and suddenly seemed to have thought of something. She asked, “Dr. Ollie, can I see the Seventh Princess?”

Dr. Ollie wanted to refuse, but when he thought of how Qiao Nian had treated the Seventh Princess’s injuries previously, he hesitated for a moment and nodded. “Alright, but can you walk me through the process of acupuncture for the Seventh Princess on me?”

A trace of confusion flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I know that Eastern medicine is broad and profound. I’m very curious about what acupuncture technique can control the Seventh Princess’s condition.” Dr. Ollie was a medical fanatic. He thought to himself that if he could use acupuncture to control the patient’s injuries in every surgery in the future, the success rate of their surgeries would increase.

Qiao Nian nodded. After disinfecting the silver needles, she did a demonstration for Dr. Ollie.

Dr. Ollie had thought that it would take half an hour for him to feel anything, but when Qiao Nian finished inserting all the needles, he was stunned.

The other half of his body seemed to have gone completely numb. The effect was as if he had been injected with anesthesia. He could not move at all, nor could he feel the existence of the other half of his body.

This… this was Eastern acupuncture!

Dr. Ollie’s eyes widened.
