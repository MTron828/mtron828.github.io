1447 Protecting Her

Qiao Nian was a little puzzled. As long as those people attached silencers to the guns in their hands, they wouldn’t alarm their people at the foot of the mountain.

However, those people did not do so. Instead, they used bows and arrows.

Qiao Nian frowned slightly, her eyes filled with confusion. It seemed that those people wanted to lure them here.

What exactly were they doing?

Before Qiao Nian could think clearly, she heard rustling in the grass behind her. She turned around and saw three cold arrows rushing towards Lina.

She instantly realized that their target was Lina.

Realizing this, Qiao Nian picked up a branch and quickly sent the three arrows flying.

Lina fell to the ground in shock. Qiao Nian confirmed that their target was Lina.

More and more arrows flew towards Qiao Nian and Lina. Chen Qing gestured for David to hide in a corner. This was the blind spot of the two groups of people.

Chen Qing went over to help Qiao Nian share the pressure.

At this moment, there was the sound of wind breaking. Qiao Nian saw a cold arrow flying over from the side. Her beautiful fox-like eyes narrowed. Just as she was about to dodge to the side, Lina appeared in front of her.

“Nian Nian!” Lina pushed Qiao Nian away. The arrow pierced through her collarbone. She immediately cried out in pain, and her body went limp.

Qiao Nian quickly supported Lina. A trace of surprise flashed in her eyes. She had never expected Lina to help her block the arrow. She was only touched.

Qiao Nian supported Lina and was about to deal with those people when someone said, “Retreat.” Everyone left. It was as if they specially wanted to hurt Lina. As long as they succeeded, they would retreat.

Chen Qing walked over to Lina. Seeing that Lina’s white tracksuit was already stained red, he asked, “How are you now?”

Lina looked at Qiao Nian and Chen Qing with a pale face. She shook her head gently and said weakly, “They wanted to deal with me. I…”

Lina really didn’t want to implicate Qiao Nian and Chen Qing.

Qiao Nian listened to the footsteps of those people getting further and further away. With a serious expression, she said, “Now is the best time for us to go down the mountain. Chen Qing, carry Lina.”

As Qiao Nian spoke, she found a thick wooden stick and walked up to David. She said seriously, “This will be your walking stick. Come down the mountain with us. If you think you can’t hold on, you can wait on the mountain. We’ll get someone to save you after we go down the mountain.”

“I’ll go down the mountain with you,” David said without hesitation. His leg was injured, and it had hurt like hell just now. Now that he was gradually getting used to this pain, he should be able to follow them with his walking stick. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

David had already bandaged his leg briefly. He could hold on.

At this moment, Lina was already on Chen Qing’s back. She lay obediently on his back, having a strange feeling.

Chen Qing was the first man to carry her.

The pain in her shoulder was suffocating her. She bit her lip, trying not to scream.

The four of them quickly arrived at the foot of the mountain. They walked to the car. Chen Qing subconsciously opened the door and prepared to put Lina into the car.

“Wait a minute.” Qiao Nian frowned slightly, her eyes cold.

Chen Qing stopped what he was doing and looked at Qiao Nian in confusion. “Madam, what’s wrong?”

“The tires have been pricked,” Qiao Nian said with a dark expression. She walked around the car and confirmed that the four tires had been pricked. Only then did she say, “Looks like those people trapped us here on purpose.”

Chen Qing took out his phone and received a text from them. He looked at Qiao Nian worriedly. “Madam, our people have been stopped outside the park.”

It would take half an hour to drive from the foot of the mountain to the entrance of the park.

Their car could no longer be driven. Were those people really just trying to take Lina’s life?

But Qiao Nian felt that something was a little strange.

If they really wanted Lina’s life, they could end her life with more bullets in the pavilion and not give them a chance to escape.
