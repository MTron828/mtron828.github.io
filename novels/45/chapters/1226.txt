“Victory!”

After the victory was displayed on the cell phone game page, Qiao Nian turned off the game and was about to order a drink when she saw that the waiter was already sitting opposite her.

A trace of shock flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes. Just as she was about to get the waiter to give her the menu, she seemed to have thought of something and stared unblinkingly at the person sitting opposite her.

The man looked to be in his thirties. His hair was neatly combed back, and his face looked very ordinary. It didn’t match his strange eyes at all.

His figure was tall and straight, and he exuded a noble aura. It was completely possible to ignore the waiter’s clothes he was wearing.

Qiao Nian frowned slightly, her gaze landing on his eyes.

His eyes narrowed slightly, like the full moon, they were filled with concern.

Qiao Nian’s pupils dilated involuntarily. Although he had already changed his face, she could still recognize the man sitting opposite her as her eldest senior brother when she looked into his eyes.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but smile. She called out happily, “Eldest Senior Brother!”

She had never expected Eldest Senior Brother to become like this.

However, it was fine as long as Eldest Senior Brother was still alive!

Qiao Nian grabbed Eldest Senior Brother’s hands and opened her mouth. She had many things to tell Eldest Senior Brother, but she didn’t know where to start.

“You’re still the same as before. You haven’t changed at all.” Chang Feng retracted his right hand and patted Qiao Nian’s head, his tone filled with care.

Qiao Nian’s excited heart calmed down quietly. She stared unblinkingly at Chang Feng and said anxiously, “Eldest Senior Brother, how did you become like this? Where have you been all these years? We’ve been looking for you!”

Towards the end, Qiao Nian’s eyes couldn’t help but turn red. She gripped Chang Feng’s left hand tightly, feeling the warmth of his hand. Only then did she realize that all of this wasn’t a dream. She had really seen Eldest Senior Brother!

Back then, when she was sixteen, Eldest Senior Brother had left them. After that, they had never heard from him again.

Qiao Nian had been by Eldest Senior Brother and Qin Chuan’s side since she was young. She had been very happy on the spiritual mountain.

Memories before the age of eighteen were especially important to Qiao Nian. She also cared a lot about her relationship with her grandfather and senior brother.

Later on, she and Qin Chuan wanted to look for Eldest Senior Brother to play, but when they arrived at the address Eldest Senior Brother had mentioned, they realized that the building was empty.

Eldest Senior Brother had disappeared just like that.

If she hadn’t received Eldest Senior Brother’s token last year and he hadn’t asked her to treat Gu Zhou’s illness, she might have thought that Eldest Senior Brother was no longer alive. She really hadn’t seen him in a long time.

Eldest Senior Brother was as important to her as her biological brother!

Even though she had already returned to the Lu family and had four brothers, they could not replace Eldest Senior Brother in her heart.

Chang Feng looked at Qiao Nian in front of him, his eyes growing gentler. After so many years, the little girl back then had already grown into a slender young lady. Seeing that Qiao Nian’s tears were about to fall, he reached out and scratched Qiao Nian’s nose, saying gently, “Little girl, how old are you now? Why are you still crying?”

Tears welled up in Qiao Nian’s eyes, but when she heard Chang Feng’s words, she instantly recalled what had happened when she was young.

When she was young, Eldest Senior Brother often scratched her little nose.

Qiao Nian picked up a tissue and wiped the tears from her eyes. She pouted and said sadly, “Eldest Senior Brother, it’s been so many years, but you haven’t come to visit me!”

When Chang Feng heard Qiao Nian’s words, he felt a little uncomfortable. He rubbed Qiao Nian’s head. “It’s all Eldest Senior Brother’s fault for not taking good care of you. Little Junior Sister has suffered.”

Qiao Nian finally stopped herself, but tears instantly welled up in her eyes again.

Seeing this, Chang Feng picked up a tissue and wiped the tears from Qiao Nian’s eyes. He said gently, “You’ve already grown up and gotten married. You’re the mother of children. Why are you still like a little crybaby like when you were young?”
