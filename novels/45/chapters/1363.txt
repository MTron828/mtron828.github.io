1364 Collapse

Just as Lu Qi was about to say something, the sound of a huge rock smashing down came from the roof of the front passenger seat. When Lu Qi heard Qin Chuan grunt, she was so frightened that she gripped the clothes in front of him tightly.

Qin Chuan whispered gently into Lu Qi’s ear, “I’m sorry, Qi Qi.”

Lu Qi’s pupils dilated slightly. Just as she was about to say something, a violent sound came from above her head and she heard Qin Chuan’s muffled groan.

“Senior,” Lu Qi called out carefully, but the rumbling of the collapse drowned out the rest of Lu Qi’s words.

Accompanied by the sound of the collapse, the car kept swaying. She was dizzy and a little breathless.

The lights in the tunnel completely dimmed. The entire world seemed to be swallowed by darkness.

After an unknown period of time, the sound of the collapse gradually disappeared. Lu Qi panted heavily, completely ignoring the fear and darkness. She wanted to see how Qin Chuan was doing.

She hadn’t heard Qin Chuan’s voice at all just now.

Lu Qi gradually moved her hand up Qin Chuan’s chest. In the darkness, she touched the scarf she had given Qin Chuan.

The scarf was a little wet and sticky. Lu Qi stopped what she was doing and continued to touch it with trembling hands. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

She touched Qin Chuan’s face. His face was still warm, and her heart, which was in her throat, gradually relaxed. Her hand inadvertently touched his nose, and her hand was sticky.

“Senior,” Lu Qi called out in a trembling voice. She placed her hand under Qin Chuan’s nose. Her hand was trembling, and she couldn’t feel Qin Chuan’s aura. She could only feel the blood on his body dripping onto her forehead.

“Senior,” Lu Qi called out helplessly. The car shook violently, and her head hit the back of the chair hard. After that, she didn’t know anything else.

…

At the Gu family villa.

Qiao Nian stood in the medicinal room, preparing to concoct the medicinal ingredients. She had just put down the medicinal ingredients and was about to take the equipment from the side when the beaker beside the experiment table accidentally fell to the ground.

Bam—

The beaker fell to the ground and shattered into countless pieces. Qiao Nian’s right pinky was also cut. Bright red blood dripped to the ground, and spread out to look like angry red flowers.

Qiao Nian looked at the wound on her hand and frowned slightly. She walked to the sink to wash up and pulled open a drawer to look for a band-aid.

The drawer was empty. Only then did Qiao Nian remember that Xiao Shi had accidentally fallen yesterday afternoon and hurt her knee. She had brought all the band-aids to the living room to help Xiao Shi bandage it.

Qiao Nian walked towards the living room. Matriarch Gu was sitting in the living room, watching the news.

“Grandma.” Qiao Nian greeted Matriarch Gu with a smile.

When Matriarch Gu heard Qiao Nian’s voice, a smile appeared on her face. Just as she was about to speak, her expression changed slightly when she saw the blood on Qiao Nian’s hand. She hurriedly stood up and quickly walked up to Qiao Nian. “Nian Nian, what’s wrong? Do you want to go to the hospital?”

Matriarch Gu was so worried that she had forgotten that Qiao Nian was a doctor. She immediately suggested that they go to the hospital. After saying that, she hurriedly explained, “Look, I was so anxious that I forgot. You’re a doctor to begin with.”

“Grandma, I just accidentally broke the beaker and cut my hand. It’s nothing serious. I’ll just put on a band-aid.” As Qiao Nian spoke, her gaze fell on the box of band-aids on the coffee table.

Matriarch Gu hurriedly pulled Qiao Nian to sit down with her. She took out a band-aid and carefully applied it to Qiao Nian. “Don’t get injured again.”

“Yes.” Qiao Nian smiled and said, “Actually, it’s nothing serious. Grandma, I made some more supplements for you. You can eat them more often to strengthen your body.”

Matriarch Gu took Qiao Nian’s hand intimately. Smiling, she said, “Nian Nian, you should rest more too. Don’t be too busy. What if you become exhausted?”

“Grandma, I’m fine. I still have unfinished business in the medicinal room. I’ll go first.” As Qiao Nian spoke, she stood up and was about to leave when she heard the news report on the television in the living room.

“This station is broadcasting a piece of news. The ten-kilometer tunnel in Wang Village north of An City has collapsed for unknown reasons. The city’s rescue team has already gone to do a search and rescue. Let us pray that the survivors in the tunnel are safe. Now, the police have also gone to investigate the cause of the tunnel collapse. If there are any new developments, this station will continue to update you.”
