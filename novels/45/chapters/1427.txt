1428 Does it still hurt?

Lina looked down at her ankle. Other than being slightly red, it no longer hurt.

Seeing that Lina had her head lowered in silence, Qiao Nian didn’t know what Lina was thinking. She asked worriedly, “Does it still hurt?”

Lina was the princess of Europe, and the fastest way for them to get close to the president of Europe. She did not want to fall out with the princess of Europe.

When Lina looked up at Qiao Nian, a trace of disbelief flashed in her eyes. There was a sweet smile on her face. “Nian Nian, you’re really amazing. My ankle no longer hurts!”

As she spoke, Lina stood up and took two steps forward, her eyes filled with surprise. “It hurt so much just now. It really doesn’t hurt at all now. It doesn’t even hurt when you walk. Your medical skills are too amazing!”

“I only know a little about medicine,” Qiao Nian said humbly.

Gu Ting, who was standing at the side, looked at Qiao Nian in satisfaction. Sugar was really proficient in everything. No wonder every time he called his mother, nine out of ten words would be about her grand daughter-in-law. She even said that it was the Gu family’s blessing for Sugar to marry into the Gu family.

He agreed with his mother very much now. The Gu family had really picked up a treasure.

Lina looked at Qiao Nian. She didn’t think that Qiao Nian only knew a little about medicine.

Qiao Nian had just seen through the problem with her ankle at a glance. Moreover, it had only taken one move to reset her dislocated ankle. Ordinary people didn’t have the ability to do so.

When the doctors of the European royal family encountered this matter, they would only ask her to take an X-ray to confirm the location of the dislocation of the bone.

However, it was getting late. It was time for her mother to sleep. She had to talk to her mother before she slept to stabilize her mother’s emotions. That way, her mother’s illness would not often relapse.

Her mother wasn’t in good health. If only Qiao Nian could treat her mother’s illness.

At the thought of this, Lina’s impression of Qiao Nian grew better and better. She smiled and waved at Qiao Nian. “Nian Nian, goodbye. I’ll go back first!”

“Be careful on the road!” Qiao Nian instructed with a smile.

“I understand!” Lina smiled and nodded, hurriedly walking out.

Looking at Lina’s hurried back, he understood why Lina and Chen Qing had bumped into each other.

Lina had something on her mind, and so did Chen Qing. That was why the two absent-minded people had bumped into each other.

After Lina left, Chen Qing said in a low voice, “That young lady just now looked a little familiar. Second Young Madam, you seem to be especially close?”

When Qiao Nian heard Chen Qing’s question, she smiled and explained, “She’s the daughter of the President of Europe, Lina. I just met her. Perhaps you’ve seen reports about Europe before. She often appears in the media.”

Chen Qing frowned slightly.

On his first day in Europe, he had knocked down the princess of Europe?

Was this considered good luck or bad luck?

Gu Zhou glanced around. Although some people had dispersed, there were still many people staring at them. He said calmly and coldly, “It’s getting late. We should go back!”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she nodded slightly and let Gu Zhou hold her hand as they walked out.

By the time they reached the hotel entrance, Su Han had already called the car over.

Gu Ting’s gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face. Previously, he had heard from others that Gu Zhou had come to Europe. He had thought that Gu Zhou was here to look for him, but from the looks of it, Gu Zhou should have other things to do.

He wondered what had happened to the Gu family when he left An City.

He wanted to ask Gu Zhou, but he knew Gu Zhou’s personality very well. If Gu Zhou was unwilling to tell him, even if he asked, he would not be able to get an answer.

Gu Ting thought for a long time before looking at Chen Qing and saying solemnly, “Chen Qing, you have to protect them well. If anything happens, you can call me directly.”

Chen Qing agreed without hesitation.

Seeing this, Gu Ting nodded and turned to leave.

Gu Zhou looked up at Gu Ting’s retreating back and recalled his father and mother’s backs when they broke up. He didn’t expect that after so many years, the relationship between his parents and his father seemed to be as cold as ever.
