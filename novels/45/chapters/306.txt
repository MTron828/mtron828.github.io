Chapter 307: Get Out

“Sister Xia Xue, you mustn’t tell a third person about this. We have to be wary of Qiao Nian in the future. Moreover, we have to destroy Qiao Nian’s hands in the future, so that she will never be able to play the violin again. That way, no one will know the truth of the matter, and you’ll be the female musician chosen by Brother Cao.”

“Then, how can I cripple Qiao Nian’s hand?” Xia Xue asked uneasily.

“I… I don’t know either. But Sister Xia Xue, don’t worry. When I return to the classroom, I’ll keep an eye on Qiao Nian. As long as I have the chance, I’ll cripple her hands! Otherwise, she’ll show off in front of us!”

“Then go quickly. Let’s contact each other on WeChat in the future!”

The recording ended abruptly.

Everyone in the school was stunned.

Gao Lin collapsed to the ground. She lowered her head in despair, not daring to look around. Even so, she could feel the people around her looking at her and Xia Xue with anger and disgust.

“Oh my god, my goddess is actually such a person!”

“I was curious previously. Qiao Nian clearly plays the violin so well. Why would Brother Cao think highly of Xia Xue? So there’s more to this matter!”

“Xia Xue is too shameless. Who gave her the confidence to snatch someone else’s position and even want to cripple their hand? She’s simply vicious!”

“My worldview has been refreshed!”

“These two people are worse than beasts!”

“Our hands are the most precious thing to us musicians. If we lose our hands, what’s the difference between us and a cripple? Moreover, Xia Xue and her are too vicious. They stole someone else’s position and even wanted to ruin their future. They’re simply eradicating them completely!”

“These two people don’t deserve to stay in our academy!”

“Get out!”

“Get out!”

“Get out!”

…

Xia Xue listened to everyone’s words and immediately felt her mind buzzing. She didn’t want to hear another word and collapsed to the ground weakly.

“No, this isn’t real. This is a synthesized voice!” Gao Lin shouted loudly. Pointing a finger at Qiao Nian, she roared hysterically, “Qiao Nian, Qiao Nian did all of this. In order to become Mr. Dong Hua’s female musician, she used all means to frame us!”

When the people around them heard Gao Lin’s words, they couldn’t help but start discussing.

“Even if your voice can be synthesized, your tone can’t!”

“Qiao Nian plays the violin so well. She doesn’t have to be jealous of you at all. Gold will always shine! You clearly have a guilty conscience!”

“Some hens must be blind to think that they’re phoenixes!”

“I’m really disappointed. I didn’t expect Xia Xue, who has always been gentle and kind, to be such a vicious person.”

…

When Xia Xue heard those words, she broke down and shouted, “No, that’s not what happened. I’m the female musician chosen by Mr. Dong Hua! Only I am! I am!”

Although Gao Lin was on the verge of a mental breakdown, she still wanted to salvage the situation. However, Xia Xue looked as if she was giving herself away.

Gao Lin hurriedly got up and ran to Xia Xue. She hurriedly hugged Xia Xue and said softly, “Sister Xia Xue, every entertainment celebrity has scandals. As long as we get past this, everything will be fine. You have to pull yourself together. What we just played was just a recording. Moreover, we can say that Qiao Nian specially hired someone to imitate our voices. As long as we refuse to admit it, no one will do anything to you!”

Liu Yu, who was standing not far away, looked at Gao Lin and Xia Xue in surprise. She had not expected this to happen.

Now that the three of them were on the same boat, they could not afford to be rash. Otherwise, they would be punished by the school.

Liu Yu forced herself to calm down.

When Xia Xue heard Gao Lin’s words, her rationality gradually returned.

That’s right. As long as she refused to admit it, she wouldn’t replace Qiao Nian.

She was also Mr. Dong Hua’s female musician, whom Brother Cao had personally selected.

As time went on, the storm would pass. No one would remember such a small matter.

Xia Xue took a deep breath. She had to salvage the situation.
