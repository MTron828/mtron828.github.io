Chapter 183 Watching the Dogfight

Su Xue screamed in pain, curling up into a ball. She wanted to hide, but there was nowhere for her to hide. She tried to crawl under the blanket, but Chen Qing had already thrown it aside.

“Did I not give you enough to eat? Did I not give you enough to drink? I’ll teach you what it means to cheat on me!” Qiao Shan was so angry that his face had turned green. He grabbed Su Xue’s hair and forced her to look at him. Using all his strength, he slapped Su Xue’s face again and again. “How dare you cheat on me? Do you want to die?!”

Su Xue’s head was spinning, and she was seeing stars. She was on the verge of fainting. As she dodged her husband’s blows, she begged for mercy. “Hubby, I’m sorry. I’m really sorry! I know I was in the wrong! Please stop hitting me. Ah, it hurts! There are outsiders around now. It’s really humiliating to do this in public! Please, please don’t hit me anymore…”

“Humiliation? How dare you mention humiliation! When you were doing such dirty things, why didn’t you think it was humiliating? Now that you’re being beaten up, you’re humiliated. I’ll beat you to death, you cheap wretch!” The more Qiao Shan thought about it, the angrier he became. He hit Su Xue with increasing force.

Su Xue could no longer handle the pain. Her gaze fell on Qiu Nan, who was curled up not far away. A glint flashed in her eyes.

At this moment, it was every man for himself. She could only push Qiu Nan out!

She no longer wanted to be beaten up.

“Hubby, I beg you. Please stop hitting. You really can’t blame me for this. It’s all Qiu Nan’s fault. It’s all his fault. If he hadn’t seduced me, I wouldn’t have made this mistake!”

Qiu Nan, who had been trembling in fear, looked at Su Xue in disbelief.

“Sister Xue, you…”

Before Qiu Nan could finish his sentence, he received a furious punch from Qiao Shan. Two of his teeth were immediately knocked out.

Coughing, Qiu Nan spat out a mouthful of blood. Before he could recover, Qiao Shan’s fist landed on his face again.

Qiu Nan could only curl up into a ball, not daring to resist.

Su Xue’s hair and face were disheveled. She slipped from the bed to the ground and hurriedly wrapped herself in the blanket, continuing to try to clear her name. “Hubby, the sun and moon will testify to my devotion to you. My love for you is like the surging river. If he hadn’t gotten me drunk, how could I have done such a thing? You have to believe me. I was being threatened. If I didn’t agree to do this with him, he would announce the scandal to the public!”

Seeing that Qiao Shan’s hatred for Qiu Nan had deepened, Su Xue heaved a sigh of relief. In any case, she just had to pretend to be the victim. “Hubby, I’m doing this for your sake. I’m afraid that if anyone finds out about this, they’ll think that you’re an embarrassment. I’m doing this for the sake of the Qiao family and our children!”

Qiao Shan’s rage intensified. He hit Qiu Nan harder and harder. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“You gigolo! Who the hell do you think you are? How dare you seduce my wife? If I don’t kill you today, my name isn’t Qiao Shan!”

Initially, Qiu Nan had been enduring Qiao Shan’s punches, thinking that Su Xue might receive fewer beatings. After all, Su Xue was his sugar mama. He still planned on taking money from her in the future.

However, Qiu Nan had never expected Su Xue to cut ties with him directly. He said with utter disappointment, “Sister Xue, you’ve gone too far. Where is your conscience? Would you dare to swear on your life and the lives of your children that what you said was the truth? You told me that your husband could no longer perform in bed. You told me you couldn’t feel the joy of being a woman. You insisted on being with me so that I could nourish you, and coaxed me into your bed with lies. How can you slander me now!”

Qiao Shan stopped what he was doing. He looked at Su Xue with a livid expression, his eyes burning with rage. If looks could kill, this adulterous couple would have died a thousand times over!

Su Xue was so frightened by Qiao Shan that she was trembling. She shook her head and scolded angrily, “Pfft, how shameless! Don’t slander me!”

“Then can you swear that you didn’t say those words?” Qiu Nan said relentlessly.

A trace of guilt flashed across Su Xue’s face. Just as she was about to say something, Qiao Shan slapped her face.

Qiao Nian watched the show indifferently, a cold smile on her lips.

After an arduous period of time, Qiao Xin had finally finished throwing up. When she came out of the bathroom, she saw Qiao Shan beating Su Xue up. She was so shocked that she stood rooted to the ground.

“Dad, stop hitting her!” Qiao Xin threw herself at him in tears.
