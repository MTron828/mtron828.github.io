1185 Clues

Actually, Qiao Nian hoped to find that woman as soon as possible. She suspected that that woman had her third child.

Thank you readers!

She had also asked her people to look for her third child, but they had never found him.

At this moment, Qiao Nian’s phone suddenly rang.

Qiao Nian picked up her phone. The caller ID was an unfamiliar number, and it was an overseas call.

She answered the call and held the phone to her ear. “Hello?”

“I’ve found a clue.” Jiang Chi’s voice came through the phone.

Qiao Nian’s eyes lit up. She asked expectantly, “What information have you found?”

“The information I received was that my brother went to see Mr. Chen before he died.”

When Qiao Nian heard Jiang Chi’s words, she was stunned. She asked in surprise, “Mr. Chen?”

“Yes.”

“Mr. Chen from HH Group?” Qiao Nian asked again.

“Yes.”

Qiao Nian’s pupils dilated involuntarily. She recalled the terrifying dream last night.

In her dream, Mr. Chen was holding a wedding with her. Then, a group of people wanted her dead. In order to protect her, Mr. Chen died with those people.

Qiao Nian felt a tightness in her chest. If Jiang Cheng was still alive, they would definitely be able to get more information. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Qiao Nian pursed her lips and asked solemnly, “Did you ask Mr. Chen out to ask him about Jiang Cheng?”

Jiang Chi hesitated for a moment before saying, “I’ve already emailed him to invite him out, but he rejected me!”

Qiao Nian could tell from Jiang Chi’s tone that he was very dissatisfied.

Qiao Nian had never expected Mr. Chen to reject Jiang Chi’s invitation.

Jiang Chi’s status in MY was unsurpassable!

“Is he in MY now?” Qiao Nian asked with a frown. She felt that something was especially strange. Mr. Chen’s back was very similar to Gu Zhou’s back. Even she couldn’t recognize the two of them from their backs.? dα

Jiang Chi was silent for a moment before frowning. “I can’t find his location now.”

“What’s your plan?”

“I’ll look for you now. I’ll tell you when the time comes!”

“Okay!”

After Qiao Nian finished talking to Jiang Chi, she hung up. Seeing Su Yan looking at her, she smiled and said, “Mom, I might have to make a trip to MY. You have to be careful when you’re at home. Perhaps that person is at home. Even if she’s not at home, she might know about our family’s situation.”

“I know. I’ll take note.” With that, Su Yan looked at Qiao Nian worriedly. “Then are you planning to go to MY alone?”

Qiao Nian smiled and continued, “He’ll definitely go with me!”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Su Yan smiled and said with satisfaction, “Ah Zhou is a good child and very considerate. I believe he will take good care of you!”

Qiao Nian smiled and nodded. She looked at Su Yan’s face, feeling a little uncomfortable.

She had just reunited with her family, but now she had no choice but to separate from them.

If it weren’t for that woman, she wouldn’t have been kidnapped and her family wouldn’t have been separated for so long. Her children would not have been swapped.

When she returned from there, she would bring the children to see her parents. Her parents would become their grandparents!

Qiao Nian reached out and took Su Yan’s arm. Leaning her head slightly on Su Yan’s shoulder, she called out softly, “Mom.”

“Yes?” Su Yan replied softly.

“I’ll definitely miss you when I get there.” Qiao Nian lowered her gaze slightly. Her children would definitely miss her too.

The smile on Su Yan’s face grew brighter. “I’ll miss you too. Come back early after you’re done!”

“Okay!”

Su Yan thought for a while before saying, “Why don’t I go with you?”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She subconsciously refused. “Mom, it’s very dangerous there. You don’t have to go over. I can handle it!”
