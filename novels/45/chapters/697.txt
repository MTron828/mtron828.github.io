Chapter 698: Sowing Discord

When Jiang Yue heard Song Yu’s words, she stopped in her tracks. She looked at Song Yu seriously and met her beautiful amber eyes. She said solemnly, “Sister Song Yu, I think Qiao Nian seems to like Brother Ah Nian too!”

The sky was high and refreshing today. A breeze blew past, and the fragrance of flowers wafted from the garden.

When Song Yu heard Jiang Yue’s words, she was slightly stunned and couldn’t help but frown. She asked in surprise, “Didn’t you just say that the person Qiao Nian likes is Brother Ah Zhou? Why did you say that she likes Second Brother? Why does that sound a little confusing?”

Jiang Yue shook her head gently and said uncertainly, “I don’t know what to say either. I’ve always thought that a girl can only like one man, but Qiao Nian seems to like two men. I can tell that she cares a lot about Brother Ah Zhou and likes him too. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have thought that I was redundant in the Gu family and chased me out.”

“If she didn’t like Brother Ah Zhou, why would she make Grandma keep a distance from me?”

When Song Yu heard Jiang Yue’s words, she was so frightened that her lips parted slightly, her eyes filled with disbelief.

Jiang Yue sighed softly and continued, “Moreover, last night, she went out to meet Brother Ah Nian at Yongan Building. She only returned home at two or three in the evening!”

Jiang Yue deliberately didn’t say that Gu Zhou had brought Qiao Nian home.

She wanted Song Yu to misunderstand that Qiao Nian had an improper relationship with Lu Nian.

As long as she could successfully sow discord between Song Yu and Qiao Nian, Song Yu would help her deal with Qiao Nian.

Jiang Yue felt that she was relatively weak. With one more person, she had a higher chance of winning.

When Song Yu heard Jiang Yue’s words, she was stunned. Her pupils involuntarily dilated, and her eyes were filled with surprise. Her voice trembled as she said, “Are you sure they met at Yongan Building?”

When Jiang Yue heard Song Yu’s anxious voice, she looked up at her.

Song Yu had indeed taken the bait.

Jiang Yue nodded and said seriously, “I had a classmate who went to the forensic department after she graduated. That day, I happened to go to play with her, and I saw Qiao Nian walking into Yongan Building with Brother Ah Nian!”

How was this possible?

Song Yu’s face turned pale, and her breathing quickened.

It was impossible for Brother Ah Nian to bring outsiders to Yongan Building.

This was because the Yongan Building hid the most important secret in Second Brother’s heart.

Every time Brother Ah Nian wanted to write a song, he would go to Yongan Building and lock himself in that small room.

When she was young, she didn’t understand why Second Brother had to stay in that room to write good songs.

On the day that children were curious, she took advantage of Second Brother’s absence to run into that small room alone.

The door of the small room was made of old wooden planks. There were many scratches on the wooden planks. This door was incompatible with the decoration style of the entire piano room.

At that time, she felt that Second Brother’s secret was hidden behind this door, so she pushed it open and walked in. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The moment she pushed the door open and saw the old decorations inside, she frowned slightly. Her gaze fell on the old piano.

She had seen this piano in photos before. This was the piano Second Brother used to practice his singing when he was young.

Song Yu’s gaze inadvertently fell on the score on the piano, and her eyes lit up.

This should be Second Brother’s new song.

Song Yu hummed a few lines according to the score. She felt that this song was very pleasant to the ear, and it seemed to contain a healing aura.

This song was simply too beautiful.

When the time came, she hurriedly placed the score on the piano, sat in front of it, and began to play this song.

A beautiful sound came from the piano. One could vaguely feel the warmth in the song.

Song Yu was a little immersed in the song.

At this moment, the door suddenly opened violently, pulling Song Yu out of the beautiful music.

The music stopped abruptly.

Song Yu turned to look at the door and saw Second Brother walking towards her angrily.
