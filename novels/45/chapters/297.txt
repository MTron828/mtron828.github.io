Chapter 298: Surviving the Calamity

When Jiang Yue saw the snake wrap itself around her neck, fear instantly welled up in her heart. Only at this moment did she understand that Gu Zhou was serious.

If she really didn’t answer, the snake would definitely bite her to death.

Just as Jiang Yue was lost in thought, the snake’s teeth pierced into her neck.

“Ah!”

Jiang Yue screamed in fear. Fear made her fall to the ground, unable to move. She looked at Gu Zhou in tears and begged for mercy. “Brother Ah Zhou, save me! Let go of me! It hurts! It hurts!!!”

Gu Zhou stood calmly at the side and looked at Jiang Yue coldly, not even blinking. The coldness emanating from him was even more terrifying than the ruthlessness of the snake.

Jiang Yue struggled in fear. She wanted to pull the snake off her body, but the snake was especially agile and avoided her hand perfectly.

What should she do?

She was going to die.

Jiang Yue couldn’t take it anymore. She shouted in pain, “Stop biting me! Stop biting me! I’ll tell you! I’ll tell you everything! Brother Ah Zhou, please make it let go!”

“Lan, come back!”

At Gu Zhou’s command, the snake flicked out its tongue and returned to Gu Zhou’s side.

Jiang Yue’s body couldn’t stop trembling. She wrapped her arms around herself. “It-it was last month. I accidentally heard you on the phone, saying something about a child. You asked Chen Qing to look for him, so I followed him. That was when I found out that you had a child…”

Towards the end, Jiang Yue sensitively sensed that Gu Zhou’s expression was turning uglier and uglier. A chill ran down her spine.

Jiang Yue’s tears fell uncontrollably. Only then did she realize that she had crossed Gu Zhou’s bottom line.

“And?”

“No, that’s all I know. Besides, I didn’t see that child,” Jiang Yue said uneasily.

As soon as Jiang Yue’s words fell, she saw Gu Zhou walking towards her step by step. When he reached her, he bent down and grabbed her neck to lift her up.

Jiang Yue’s expression grew uglier and uglier. She tried hard to stand on her tiptoes and breathed in oxygen with difficulty.

Gu Zhou stared into Jiang Yue’s eyes and questioned, “You found a way to ruin my marriage with Qiao Nian. This time, you want to test her with the child?”

When Jiang Yue heard Gu Zhou’s words, she swallowed in fear and shook her head vigorously. “No, I didn’t. I really didn’t. You’ve misunderstood me…”

“Do you want me to repeat the question you asked Qiao Nian?”

Tears streamed down Jiang Yue’s face as she recalled what she had just said.

In the beginning, she had asked Qiao Nian if she liked children, and when Qiao Nian would be able to give birth.

Her words made it seem like Brother Ah Zhou had an illegitimate child.

Jiang Yue looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief.

He had actually understood everything.

Did he care so much about Qiao Nian?

Was he that worried that Qiao Nian would not accept that child? 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Or did he not want others to know that he had an illegitimate child?

Just as Jiang Yue’s thoughts were running wild, she suddenly felt the grip on her neck tighten.

She could no longer breathe.

In the next moment, Gu Zhou seemed to be about to break her neck.

This was the first time Jiang Yue had seen Gu Zhou so angry.

If Gu Zhou wanted to kill her now, she would not be able to resist at all.

Jiang Yue closed her eyes in despair.

The suffocating feeling made her vision blur. She could vaguely see death approaching.

Just as Jiang Yue thought that she was doomed, Gu Zhou let go of her and flung her far away.

Jiang Yue’s body slammed into the wall and fell back down.

She clutched her neck in pain and coughed violently, taking in deep breaths of fresh air. Tears gradually fell from the corners of her eyes.

She looked up at Gu Zhou and saw him opening the study door.

Was Brother Ah Zhou not planning to kill her?

Jiang Yue heaved a sigh of relief. A trace of relief flashed in her eyes, as if she had just survived a calamity.
