1452 How Dare You!

Wright’s bodyguards heard Wright’s words and prepared to pull the trigger.

At this moment, a cold male voice sounded from behind him. “How dare you!”

His voice was low, as if he was the King of Hell from hell. It carried a sinister coldness that seeped into his bones.

Wright shivered uncontrollably. He turned back and saw a man walking slowly towards him. Behind him seemed to be the entire hell. Every step he took made him shiver.

The people around the man were all holding submachine guns. In an instant, they surrounded him and his bodyguards.

Wright’s face suddenly turned pale. His gaze fell on the weapons in the hands of the men and he frowned.

Submachine gun?

None of his people had such equipment. The man in front of him could actually make a bodyguard hold such a dangerous weapon.

He looked at Gu Zhou’s eyes. With just one look, he felt as if he had been pulled into an ice cave that had been sealed for tens of thousands of years. It was bone-chilling.

Wright frowned slightly. When had there been such a capable person in Europe? Why didn’t he know?

Wright lowered his gaze slightly. The ruthlessness in his eyes dissipated a little, but it was more because he was afraid of this man.

When Wright’s bodyguards saw the men with submachine guns, they were like troublemakers meeting a teacher. They were so frightened that they threw their guns away and raised their hands to confess.

Gu Zhou glanced at Wright indifferently. He passed by Wright and finally walked to Qiao Nian’s side.

He looked at Qiao Nian’s hand, and the coldness in his eyes instantly disappeared, leaving only gentleness. He gently caressed Qiao Nian’s face with his right hand. He wanted to help Qiao Nian wipe the blood off her face, but he was afraid that he would hurt her. He frowned slightly and asked worriedly, “Nian Nian, where are you hurt?”

Qiao Nian knew what Gu Zhou was worried about. She reached out and took his hand, saying gently, “I’m fine. Why did you suddenly come?”

She really hadn’t expected Gu Zhou to come. She had already thought of snatching the guns from those people and rushing straight to Wright to threaten him. That way, she could use Wright’s car to get down the mountain.

Gu Zhou didn’t answer Qiao Nian immediately. His gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. Seeing that although there was blood on her face, there were no wounds, he heaved a sigh of relief.

Although he knew that Qiao Nian wasn’t injured, he was still extremely worried when he saw the blood on her face.

Fortunately, Qiao Nian was fine.

Gu Zhou took out a handkerchief from his pocket and gently wiped the blood off Qiao Nian’s face. He explained slowly, “I’ve already told Chen Qing to contact me every half an hour. If he doesn’t contact me after half an hour, it means that something has happened.”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, her lips curved up slightly. She hadn’t expected him to be so considerate and meticulous.

Actually, she hadn’t thought too much about it. She just felt that climbing the mountain was just a small matter. How could an accident happen?

But everything that had happened now made her realize one thing. The waters here in Europe were very murky.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou, then at Lina, who was in Chen Qing’s arms. She said, “Lina’s shoulder is injured. She needs to go to the hospital as soon as possible. David’s leg is injured, so he needs to be checked to see if the bullet is left in his leg. Let’s go to the hospital now.”

At this point, Qiao Nian glanced at the mountain not far away and said in a low voice, “There are still many corpses at the pavilion on the mountain. Send someone to investigate and see who sent them.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

As she spoke, Qiao Nian glanced at Wright.

When Wright heard Qiao Nian’s words, his expression changed drastically. Then, he pretended that nothing had happened.

Gu Zhou glanced at David’s leg and Lina’s shoulder. Qiao Nian wasn’t the one who had bandaged David’s leg, but Qiao Nian had bandaged Lina’s shoulder. It seemed that Qiao Nian had already treated Lina’s wound.

Gu Zhou frowned slightly. Then, he gave the person beside him a look, and someone immediately went to make arrangements.

“Wait!” Wright pretended to be calm. If he missed this opportunity, he would definitely not have such a good opportunity in the future.
