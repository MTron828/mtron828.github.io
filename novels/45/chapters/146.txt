Chapter 147 The Gown

“Grandma…”

Before Qiao Nian could finish her sentence, Matriarch Gu stepped out of the room.

Just as Qiao Nian was about to chase after her, she heard Matriarch Gu say loudly, “Nian Nian, don’t change out of the gown yet. Wait for

me.”

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but smile. In reality, Matriarch Gu was just like a child. Sometimes, she was especially adorable, as if age didn’t matter to her at all. In just three minutes, Matriarch Gu ran in holding a DSLR. Her face was slightly flushed from the exercise.

“Nian Nian, stand beside the wardrobe and pose. A casual one will do. I’ll take a photo for you.” As Matriarch Gu spoke, she hurriedly switched on the camera in her hand.

Seeing how happy Matriarch Gu was, Qiao Nian didn’t want to sour her mood. Obediently, she began to pose.

Matriarch Gu’s eyes lit up. Holding the camera, she began taking photographs of Qiao Nian from all angles. No matter the angle from which the photograph was taken, Qiao Nian was still beautiful.

If it weren’t for the fact that Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian had yet to officially announce their marriage to the public, Matriarch Gu would have used this photograph to publicize their marriage everywhere she went. Then, she would have told the entire world that her granddaughter-in-law was the beautiful fairy-like maiden in the photograph.

Matriarch Gu couldn’t help but smile. After taking the photographs, she said to Qiao Nian, “Change out of the gown first. I’ll iron it tomorrow, then get someone to send it to the banquet.”

Qiao Nian smiled and nodded. “Okay.”

After Qiao Nian entered the changing room, the smile on her face gradually faded.

If she were to appear at the lecture wearing this gown, it wouldn’t be long before the entire world knew about it. Perhaps, it would even be named as the world’s best-designed evening gown.

That was enough to prove Matriarch Gu’s talent in fashion design. Moreover, the fact that Matriarch Gu was giving her this gown to wear to the lecture also meant that Matriarch Gu really liked her, and doted on her greatly.

If Matriarch Gu knew that she was leaving the Gu family soon, then Matriarch Gu…

Qiao Nian didn’t dare to think further.

The only thing she could do now was treat Matriarch Gu’s heart disease.

At noon the next day, the speech ceremony of the Second Academy of Medicine officially began.

Apart from prominent professors and outstanding students from the Second Academy of Medicine, there were also professionals from various large research institutes, including the medical research institute, present at the ceremony. Not only that, but there were also some famous doctors from private hospitals.

This was because after graduating from the Second Academy of Medicine, alumni would not only work in national hospitals, but also in private hospitals. This ceremony provided an opportunity for current students to interact with the big shots in the medical field as well. Of course, some of the guests were also investors belonging to high society. Qiao Nian stepped in and saw that everyone inside was chatting and laughing. Gazing over, she saw Gu Zhou in the crowd. Gu Zhou was walking in, wearing a well-tailored suit. His phoenix-like eyes swept around, and he inadvertently met her gaze. The two of them looked at each other across the sea of people.

Gu Zhou gave off a cold and unapproachable aura, as if he was an otherworldly spirit belonging to another dimension.

Qiao Nian hadn’t expected Gu Zhou to be here today as well.

However, she recalled that Gu Zhou had reached an agreement with Director Lin regarding the research institute. It was only natural that he would come today.

Suddenly, a scream came from afar. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Oh my god, that man is so handsome!”

“He looks like a male god!” “He’s practically a walking sack of hormones!” “Oh my god, I want to give birth to his child now.”

The elite in An City all knew one another. The investors among the crowd looked at Gu Zhou in confusion.

“Second Young Master Gu has been coming out of his house quite often lately.”

“I think so. Has he recovered?”

“I heard that his illness is incurable. He must have stayed at home for too long. He doesn’t want to live the rest of his life in a lifeless state, so that must be why he often comes out to experience the world.”

When Qiao Nian heard these words, her brow furrowed imperceptibly.
