934 Does This Matter?

When Qiao Nian heard Qiao Yu’s words, she felt as if she had returned to the night she had been bullied.

“Firstly, six years ago, I was drugged by her. She personally admitted to sending me off to an old man. I don’t have a difficult request. She just has to spend a night with an old man! Secondly, you said that she was shot. This has nothing to do with me. I won’t be as vicious as your sister!”

“But before she entered the operating theater, she kept saying that you were the one who harmed her!”

“Heh…” Qiao Nian sneered.

“Qiao Nian, she’s my only sister!”

“I have nothing to do with how many sisters you have. If you have time to talk nonsense with me, you might as well get someone to investigate. Also, she’s been the one who harmed me all this time. Why should I forgive someone who harmed me? If anything, the Qiao family owes me compensation. But I’m really grateful to the person who shot Qiao Xin. You brought this upon yourself. I hope your sister reaches hell soon!”

“Are you saying that you didn’t do it?” Although Qiao Nian’s words didn’t sound pleasant, Qiao Yu knew in his heart that Qiao Nian wouldn’t lie.

“Does that matter? You already had the answer in your heart from the beginning!” Qiao Nian’s voice was cold.

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Qiao Yu recalled what had happened six years ago.

At that time, Qiao Xin had told him that Qiao Nian couldn’t stand loneliness and seduced other men. That was why Qiao Nian was pregnant with an old man’s child.

At that time, he didn’t trust Qiao Nian. When he found out later, he realized how wrong he was.

Qiao Yu found it difficult to breathe. He said bitterly, “I’m sorry, I…”

“There’s no need to apologize!” Qiao Nian interrupted Qiao Yu without hesitation and said impatiently, “If she dies, tell me. When the time comes, I’ll set off more fireworks to celebrate her going to hell!”

“Qiao Nian!”

“Qiao Yu!” Qiao Nian’s voice instantly turned cold, mixed with anger. She said fearlessly, “Double standard dog!”

Qiao Yu was so angry that he was panting heavily. In the end, he suppressed his anger. “Consider what happened today to be my fault. I apologize to you, but I hope you can stay away from my sister in the future and not hurt her again!”

“Then take good care of your despicable sister. If she sticks to me like glue and does some dirty and despicable things, don’t blame me for being impolite!” Qiao Nian paused for a moment, then continued, “Qiao Xin looks alright, but her heart is so dirty and despicable. Someone like her should stay in a smelly ditch. She shouldn’t come out to disgust people!”

With that, Qiao Nian hung up without waiting for Qiao Yu to speak.

They were birds of a feather.

No matter what, Qiao Yu felt that Qiao Xin was right. If he cared so much about trusting his sister, he might as well be with her directly.

In Qiao Yu’s eyes, the Qiao family could not be wrong. Everyone else was in the wrong.

Brother Qiao Yu, who had cared about her and doted on her when she was young, had probably died in the countryside long ago.

Qiao Nian frowned slightly. She was a little curious about who had injured Qiao Xin. Who was so brave? Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Could it be her brother?

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian called Lu Zhu.

The call went through quickly.

“Sugar, why aren’t you asleep yet?”

Qiao Nian glanced at the Gu family villa. She was conflicted about whether to enter. Of course, she wouldn’t tell Lu Zhu about this.

“Brother, I just wanted to ask if you’ve been to the Red Bar today.”

“I have!”

Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat. She asked carefully, “Could it be that Qiao Xin…”

“I was the one who shot her in the leg!” Lu Zhu said honestly. In his opinion, there was nothing to hide.

Qiao Nian’s heart was in her throat. She hurriedly said, “Brother, there’s no need for us to risk our lives for a piece of trash like Qiao Xin. I’ve already thought of how to punish her. To her, it’s easier to die than to live!”

Now that he shot Qiao Xin, Qiao Xin might be a little afraid, but this fear was only temporary.

If he wanted to deal with Qiao Xin, he would have to break her down completely and make her wish she was dead.
