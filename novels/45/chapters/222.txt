Chapter 223: Strange Gift

Logically speaking, she should be very touched that Zhao Qian had made a dress for her with her own hands.

However, for some reason, the word of thanks that Qiao Nian was meaning to give remained lodged in her throat.

Looking at Zhao Qian, she asked in confusion, “Why did you think of making this?”

“Actually, I’ve always liked designing clothes.” Zhao Qian smiled and said, “Grandma isn’t in good health, so I thought that if I studied medicine, I would be able to treat Grandma’s illness in the future.”

At this point, Zhao Qian paused for a moment, a happy smile appearing on her face. She continued, “But before I could master the skills, Second Sister-in-law, you married into the family. I know that Second Sister-in-law’s medical skills are brilliant. I’ll be at ease if I leave Grandma to you, so I want to pursue my own dreams now.”

“Is it your dream to become a fashion designer?” Qiao Nian asked.

“Yes, I’ve already applied to a school in Country ML, and I’ve already received their acceptance letter.” Zhao Qian smiled at Qiao Nian, holding on to both her hands. “Second Sister-in-law, I know I’m a little selfish for handing Grandma over to you. I hope you won’t be angry with me.”

Qiao Nian could hear the sincerity and honesty in Zhao Qian’s words. She comforted her softly, saying, “Grandma will be fine as long as nothing happens out of the blue, and as long as she continues to take good care of her health. It’s only after you’ve found me trustworthy that you’re handing Grandma over to me. I think that’s very filial of you.”

“That’s good. Second Sister-in-law, don’t worry. I’ll try to cram three years of classes into one year. I’ll come back early and take care of Grandma!” With that, Zhao Qian retracted her hands, closed the box containing the lingerie, and stuffed it into Qiao Nian’s hand. “Second Sister-in-law, you can try it on tonight. I think Brother Ah Zhou will definitely like it!”

Qiao Nian: ...

In the end, Qiao Nian carried the box back to the bedroom. She had no intention of wearing this lingerie at all. Instead, she stuffed the box directly into the bottom of the wardrobe, lest others find out about it. Then, she would never be able to clear her name.

The next morning.

After Qiao Nian washed up and had breakfast, she arrived at the entrance of the music academy.

This academy had very strict security. No outsiders were allowed to enter.

Qiao Nian walked over to the guard and showed him the admission letter before walking in.

Cutting through the campus was a wide marble path. There were hundreds of flowers lining both sides of the path, and a three-meter-tall fountain in the center of the campus. The water from the fountain flowed into the pool below, creating a beautiful melody.

Qiao Nian continued walking further into the campus. Many students had already gotten up to practice their instruments. She felt like she was swimming in a sea of music.

Qiao Nian walked to the professors’ office, then handed her acceptance letter to the director of the department of traditional musical instruments.

Director Hu looked to be in his sixties. He was thin and wore reading glasses.

Looking down at the acceptance letter in his hand, he realized that this student had been personally recommended by the principal. With a solemn expression, he looked at Qiao Nian, clearly thinking highly of her. “Which instruments do you like best?”

“The guqin and the bass.” Qiao Nian stood there obediently, like a good student.

Director Hu nodded slightly and said with a smile, “That’s quite a leap.”

Qiao Nian smiled. “Yes.”

“Come with me!”

“Yes!” Inside, Qiao Nian was jumping with joy.

Director Hu brought Qiao Nian directly to Classroom 502 on the fifth floor of the seventh school building. He knocked on the door.

“Please come in.”

Director Hu pushed open the classroom door and smiled at the professor standing at the podium. “Professor Zhang, I’ve brought you a new student today!”

When the students who were in class heard Director Hu’s words, they all looked over, their eyes filled with dissatisfaction.

Half a semester had already passed. If a new student suddenly joined the class, it would pull down the average score of the entire class. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Moreover, they were the most outstanding class in the entire grade. If their final results were ruined because of this newcomer, it would be disastrous.
