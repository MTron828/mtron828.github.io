Chapter 1798 - 1798 Afraid of Death

When Cui Si thought of this, his eyes could not help but turn red.

Mark had killed so many people in the Cui family for his own selfish desires. Hadn’t Mark thought that his day would come when the matter would be exposed?Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Ridiculous. It was extremely ridiculous.

Chang Feng walked over from the side and stood in front of Mark, blocking Cui Si’s gun.

Cui Si pursed his lips tightly and looked at Chang Feng angrily. His eyes were filled with anger as he said coldly, “Chang Feng, stand aside!”

He looked at Chang Feng and anger surged in his heart. “Even if the president isn’t my enemy, you betrayed me. I can’t wait to kill you now! Get lost!”

Cui Si wanted to kill Chang Feng, but he knew in his heart that if he killed Chang Feng now, the hall would be in chaos again. Mark might take the opportunity to escape.

He didn’t want Mark to have a chance to live.

Chang Feng looked at Cui Si calmly and said calmly, “I’m only Chen Sheng’s subordinate to begin with. I’ll only listen to his orders!”

“Move aside, or I’ll kill you!” Cui Si shouted in exasperation.

No matter what the situation was, he could tolerate it as long as he killed Mark.

Chang Feng looked past Cui Si and behind him.

Cui Si heard footsteps behind him. He turned around and saw the president walking to his side.

The president suppressed the gun in Cui Si’s hand and said gently, “Cui Si, Mark has done many wrong things for so many years for his own selfish desires. He pretended to destroy the Cui family in my name. Perhaps he even used a similar method to recruit others.”

“If you kill him now, no one will know the mistakes he has made over the years. The people he has harmed have been kept in the dark. They might even foolishly work for him. I want him to live. At that time, the mistakes he has made will be revealed to everyone. At that time, he will pay for his past mistakes.”

When Cui Si heard the president’s words, he sneered. “President, I understand what you’re saying, but I’m not you. I don’t want to experience the feelings of other victims. I just want to avenge my family.”

Cui Si gripped the gun in his hand tightly. This was his only chance now, because he would never have another chance in the future.

When the President heard Cui Si’s words, he pursed his lips slightly and glanced meaningfully at the people who had appeared in the hall. He said, “I know in my heart that you’ll only be happy if you take revenge, but what about the people you brought? They might be in danger because you killed Mark. You’re a good general. In the past, you’ve always cared about your soldiers. Can you bear to let these loyal soldiers die in a foreign country?”

The image of his father appeared in Cui Si’s mind. His father had always told him a saying in the past.

A good general had to put himself in the shoes of his soldiers and be responsible for them.

Cui Si pursed his lips and did not speak.

The President looked at Cui Si in front of him and took a deep breath. He continued, “Cui Si, I know how much you hate Mark, but it’s not easy for you to reunite with Cui Qi now. Are you going to watch him live alone in this world?”

Cui Si subconsciously looked at Cui Qi, who was standing at the side. Cui Qi was looking at him with red eyes.

Over the years, he was not able to give Cui Qi an ordinary family life. If he shot Mark, he was afraid that Cui Qi would not have an easy life.

As parents, they should always consider their children.

Cui Si sighed helplessly. He looked up at the president in front of him with red eyes and asked tentatively, “At this point, will you still let us live?”

In fact, Cui Si had originally thought that even if the president had not killed the Cui family back then, he would probably bear a grudge against him for bringing many people to kill the president this time.

The president looked into Cui Si’s eyes. His eyes were a little red, and his blue eyes were sparkling. He raised his hand and patted Cui Si’s shoulder, trying to adjust his breathing. “Cui Si, I once told you that I’m really grateful for everything you’ve done for me. You’re my best friend.”
