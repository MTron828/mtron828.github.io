Chapter 218: Danger

If Gu Zhou fell ill again in the future and split into a different personality once again, it would probably take a lot of energy. If this continued, Gu Zhou might be completely drained of energy very soon.

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze. Moreover, she couldn’t tell Gu Zhou about his split personality yet, because that would only worsen his condition.

Qiao Nian looked up and met Gu Zhou’s cold eyes. She decided to lie. “It’s like this. Chen Qing came to me in a hurry and said that you had fainted. When I arrived, you were throwing things around. When you saw me, you gave me the crystal cup. Then, for some reason, you fainted.”

Gu Zhou frowned slightly. Why didn’t he have any impression of what Qiao Nian had said?

“There was really too much dirt on you. It was windy outside, and we were afraid that you would catch a cold, so we sent you to the bathroom to take a bath.” Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou sincerely and continued, “I stayed behind to help you with the acupuncture, but you woke up.”

Gu Zhou’s gaze inadvertently fell on Qiao Nian’s fair, swan-like neck. It was flushed slightly pink, and traces of soap lingered around her collarbones. Her hair was also wet, and the front of her shirt was a little damp. He could vaguely glimpse her beautiful figure.

Gu Zhou’s mouth went a little dry, and his breathing quickened. He turned his head to the side and asked indifferently, “Did I hurt you?”

Qiao Nian shook her head. “No.”

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but recall how obedient and adorable Gu Zhou had been when he had turned into Zhou Zhou. Other than the fact that he cried a lot, there was nothing wrong with him.

However, Zhou Zhou was still a child. It was normal for him to cry.

As Qiao Nian thought about this, she couldn’t help but glance at Gu Zhou again. Gu Zhou’s expression was frigid and impersonal, and his eyes were unfathomably deep. It made one shiver.

She silently retracted her gaze. Gu Zhou was Gu Zhou. His personality was very different from Zhou Zhou’s.

“Why are you looking at me like that?” Gu Zhou frowned.

Qiao Nian came back to her senses. Smiling awkwardly, she hurriedly said, “It’s nothing. I just wanted to ask if you were hungry.”

When Gu Zhou heard the word “hungry”, he recalled that he had initially planned to celebrate Qiao Nian’s birthday today, but the food he had meticulously prepared had all been ruined.

Fortunately, the crystal cup he had specially prepared for her was still intact.

Gu Zhou turned to look at Chen Qing. “Chen Qing.”

Chen Qing had been standing at the side, listening to their conversation. After hearing Madam’s simple explanation, his uneasy heart finally settled down. Madam was right. No one could know that Second Young Master had turned into a child.

He smiled at Gu Zhou and asked, “Second Young Master, what can I do for you?”

“Is there anything else to eat?”

Chen Qing shook his head. “All the food was already on the table.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Where’s the fruit?”

“It’s gone too.” As soon as Chen Qing finished speaking, he seemed to remember something. His eyes lit up and he hurriedly said, “I remember that there was instant noodles in the car.”

When Chen Qing finished speaking, he instantly regretted his words.

What was he saying?

Today was Second Young Madam’s twenty-third birthday!

On this day, Second Young Madam should be eating good food, not instant noodles!

Chen Qing was a little annoyed with himself. Just as he was about to correct himself, he heard Qiao Nian say, “Hurry up and bring me the instant noodles.”

Actually, Qiao Nian was already starving. She didn’t want to wait any longer.

When Gu Zhou heard the words “instant noodles”, he couldn’t help but frown. Disdain was written all over his face. “Is that edible?”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she looked at him in disbelief. “Don’t tell me you’ve never eaten instant noodles before!”

“I won’t eat that kind of food,” Gu Zhou said expressionlessly.

Qiao Nian shook her head in disapproval and said, “Instant noodles are especially delicious. It’s practically a delicacy. Don’t worry, when I’m done cooking, I’m sure you’ll find it especially fragrant!”
