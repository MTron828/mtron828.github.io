Chapter 368: Crisis

“Let’s not talk about whether this painting is real or fake. If only I had a domineering brother like Qiao Yu.”

“I’m so envious of Qiao Nian too. If only my brother could dote on me so much. But my brother only likes those despicable women outside!”

Another person said angrily, “My brother is the same. What he hates the most now is that my father gave birth to me!”

“If killing someone wasn’t illegal, I think my brother would have killed me long ago!”

…

When Qiao Xin heard the words of the people around her, her heart skipped a beat. For some reason, she felt a sense of panic.

Everyone else could tell that their brother was protecting Qiao Nian. Moreover, their brother had completely revealed his feelings for Qiao Nian, without hiding anything.

But she remembered that her brother didn’t seem to like Qiao Nian…

What made Qiao Xin feel terrible was that all this time, she had always felt that her brother doted on her the most, but she had never expected that she wasn’t the only sister in his heart.

Over the years, the thing she was most proud of was that she was Qiao Yu’s younger sister.

Her older brother was her role model as others said he was good at studying, obedient, smart, and capable.

...

Since her brother was so outstanding, the others treated her very well.

Some people who wanted to be her sister-in-law would always give her all kinds of branded gifts.

If those people knew that her brother treated Qiao Nian very well as well, some of the love her brother gave her would be taken away, and half of the gifts she received would be taken away by Qiao Nian.

Just thinking about it made Qiao Xin feel suffocated. Her face grew paler and paler.

Song Yu elegantly tucked her hair behind her ear. Her red lips curved up slightly as she said slowly, “Mr. Qiao, I know that you care about your sister, but the number of paintings that Mr. Jiang has appraised might be more than the number of paintings you and I have seen, so I believe that there’s nothing wrong with his appraisal.”

At this point, Song Yu’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face, then on Qiao Yu. “I think your sister has also been deceived. Why don’t we ask her how she obtained this painting? As long as we find the person who gave it to her, we can punish the person who sold the fake painting.” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Song Yu’s words brought the conversation back to the topic at hand. Moreover, she was trying to defend Qiao Nian.

“Miss Song is right. I believe in Mr. Jiang’s appraisal ability!”

“Miss Qiao, since you were also deceived, we won’t pursue the matter further. Why don’t you make a call in public and ask why the person who gave you the painting wanted to harm you!”

“Miss Song is indeed my idol. Even at a time like this, she’s still speaking up for Qiao Nian. If it were me, I might have started cursing.”

“Miss Qiao, quickly call and ask!”

…

There were also some people who were fans of Mr. Huang Shi. Their comments were more radical.

“I hate it when people imitate Mr. Huang Shi’s work. If we don’t get to the bottom of this today, we’ll see you on Weibo tomorrow!”

“Piracy is the worst. We must protect Mr. Huang Shi’s rights!”

.

“Mr. Huang Shi has sealed his brush for so many years, yet someone still pirated his paintings. How shameless!”

…

When Qiao Nian heard the others’ words, she pursed her lips and slowly lowered her gaze.

Qin Lu, who was standing at the side, realized that Qiao Nian was no longer as calm as before. Moreover, Qiao Nian’s emotions seemed to have changed. Her lips curved up slightly.

If it weren’t for Qiao Nian, she could still continue to be a teacher in a kindergarten.

If it weren’t for Qiao Nian, she wouldn’t have been beaten up when she entered.

There was already a feud between her and Qiao Nian.

Qin Lu looked at Qiao Nian and questioned, “Miss Qiao, do you think you can escape your responsibility just by lowering your head?”

Seeing that Qiao Nian was silent, Qin Lu continued, “Since you already knew that there was something wrong with this painting, why did you…”
