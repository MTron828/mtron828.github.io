752 Why Do You Like Me?

Qiao Nian sat on Gu Zhou’s lap. Although she was wearing clothes, she could still feel the scorching heat of his body.

“I-I want to sit on the sofa.” Qiao Nian struggled to get off Gu Zhou.

However, just as she moved, she noticed that Gu Zhou had used his hand to completely restrain her waist.

She could feel Gu Zhou’s hand on her waist. His palm was burning hot, making her blush.

“Gu Zhou.” Qiao Nian looked up at him and enunciated each word clearly. “Why do you like me?”

Was it because I’m your doctor? Or because Gu Qi likes me?

Qiao Nian couldn’t ask the remaining two sentences directly, so she could only ask vaguely. She looked at Gu Zhou calmly with her brows furrowed.

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s question, his lips curved up slightly. His sexy Adam’s apple bobbed as he asked, “Do I need a reason to like someone?”

Qiao Nian was speechless.

Silently, Qiao Nian pushed Gu Zhou’s hand away from her waist and asked, “Then how long have you liked me?”

If Gu Zhou said that he liked her before Gu Qi came to the Gu family, it meant that Gu Zhou really liked her.

On the contrary, it meant that Gu Zhou liked her because of Gu Qi.

“It has been a long time.”

Qiao Nian frowned slightly and asked, “How long is a long time?”

Gu Zhou raised his index finger and gently placed it on Qiao Nian’s face.

The skin on her face was very tender and smooth, and it felt especially comfortable to the touch.

Gu Zhou’s lips curved up slightly as he continued, “After I bit your face.”

Qiao Nian was even more confused. Why hadn’t she known that Gu Zhou had bitten her face?

Could it be that she also had a split personality? Could it be that she had long flirted with Gu Zhou?

However, Gu Zhou didn’t answer this question. He skipped the topic and looked at Qiao Nian seriously. “Then are you willing to accept Xiao Qi?”

Qiao Nian got off Gu Zhou and sat down on the sofa on the other side. Thinking of Gu Qi’s mother, she asked solemnly, “But you still haven’t told me who Gu Qi’s biological mother is. What characteristics does she have?”

She really wanted to help Gu Qi find her biological mother.

She could understand Gu Qi’s feelings very well. Every child wanted to grow up safely and happily by their parents’ side.

The light in Gu Zhou’s eyes dimmed. He didn’t want to discuss this matter with Qiao Nian at all. However, since he had already chosen to confess, he didn’t want to continue hiding it.

“Actually, I don’t know what characteristics she has either.”

Qiao Nian couldn’t believe what she was hearing. Was Gu Zhou joking?

How could he not know what Xiao Qi’s mother was like?

A trace of dissatisfaction flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes. Then, she said seriously, “You and her created Xiao Qi. How can you not know what characteristics she has?”

“Actually, at that time, I was schemed against. I was delirious, and that was what happened,” Gu Zhou said uncomfortably.

“Could it be that Xiao Qi’s mother plotted against you on purpose?” Qiao Nian asked.

“No, at that time, she was also schemed against.” Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian with a burning gaze, worried that Qiao Nian would be angry. However, he still added, “In the end, I’ve let her down.”

Qiao Nian narrowed her eyes at Gu Zhou. She pursed her lips tightly and said nothing.

From Gu Zhou’s words, she could tell that he was defending Gu Qi’s biological mother.

She had a vague feeling that in Gu Zhou’s heart, Gu Qi’s biological mother was very important. No one could blaspheme or insult her.

However, from Gu Zhou’s words, Qiao Nian could tell that Gu Zhou and Gu Qi’s biological mother had only met once.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou calmly. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The past had already happened, and it couldn’t be changed. There was no need to dwell on it.

All she had to do was look to the future.

As for whether she would feel uncomfortable?

She did not feel uncomfortable at all.

However, she felt that it was a pity.

If Gu Qi’s mother had not disappeared, the family of three might have been reunited long ago.
