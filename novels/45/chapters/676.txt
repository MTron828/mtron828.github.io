Seeing Gu Zhou’s pale face, Qiao Nian thought that he was sick. She hurriedly placed her hand on his forehead.

Gu Zhou narrowed his eyes.

Qiao Nian moved her hand away and placed it on her forehead again. Puzzled, she said, “I don’t think you have a fever!”

With that, Qiao Nian took Gu Zhou’s hand and began to take his pulse.

The coldness in Gu Zhou’s eyes gradually dissipated. He grabbed Qiao Nian’s hand and walked towards the front passenger seat.

Qiao Nian looked down at Gu Zhou holding her hand. She had a strange feeling.

Walking to the passenger door, Gu Zhou opened it and watched as Qiao Nian got into the car. Only then did he close the passenger door. He walked around the car and sat down in the driver’s seat.

Qiao Nian kept looking at Gu Zhou. She felt that Gu Zhou was a little abnormal. Silently, she buckled her seatbelt.

Gu Zhou got into the car.

“It’s quite easy to get a taxi here. You don’t have to come out in the middle of the night just for me.” Qiao Nian smiled at Gu Zhou and asked tentatively.

She was very curious if Gu Zhou had driven over or if he had not left.

“I just got here.”

The smile on Qiao Nian’s face froze for a moment, but she quickly regained her composure. She had thought that Gu Zhou had not left.

Gu Zhou started the car.

Qiao Nian sat in the front passenger seat. Although she hadn’t done anything wrong, she felt inexplicably guilty.

Qiao Nian felt inexplicably nervous. She felt that the atmosphere in the car was a little awkward.

In order to ease the awkwardness, she coughed lightly and said, “When I went to listen to Brother Ah Nian’s new song today, I bumped into the psychiatrist I found previously.”

Gu Zhou involuntarily tightened his grip on the steering wheel and looked straight ahead. His voice was a little hoarse. “What did the doctor say?”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s response, her heart, which had been in her throat, finally settled back down.

Since Gu Zhou was willing to discuss Xiao Qi with her, it meant that the current Gu Zhou was not Gu Chuan.

She really did not want to see the terrifying Gu Chuan again, because the suffocating feeling Gu Chuan gave her made her extremely afraid.

Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief and continued, “The doctor said that he needs more observation.”

As she spoke, the car arrived at the traffic light. It was a red light, and Gu Zhou stepped on the brakes. Only then did he turn to look at Qiao Nian and ask in confusion, “Aren’t we sure that Xiao Qi doesn’t have autism?”

“I know that Xiao Qi doesn’t have autism, but I want him to be more cheerful. I’ve never taken care of a child before, and I don’t know how to communicate with him, so I want to ask the doctor if there’s a better way to make Xiao Qi lively and outgoing!”

Gu Qing was a famous psychiatrist. She would definitely have a better solution.

“What did the psychiatrist say?”

“The timing isn’t right today, and I didn’t have the chance to talk to her much. I’ll look for her after the death anniversary of the eldest daughter of the Lu family. When the time comes, I’ll ask her in detail!”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he frowned slightly. He stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian and asked, “Do you still want to come here?”

“Yeah.”

Only then did Qiao Nian notice that Gu Zhou was staring at her. A trace of panic flashed in her eyes. She hurriedly turned her head to the side and noticed that the traffic light had turned green.

“The light has turned green. We can leave now!” Qiao Nian lowered her eyes slightly.

Only then did Gu Zhou retract his gaze indifferently. He started the engine and continued driving. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

It was getting late and Qiao Nian was a little sleepy. She didn’t want to talk to Gu Zhou anymore, so she closed her eyes to rest.

Qiao Nian knew in her heart that Gu Zhou didn’t want her to meet her brother.

From Gu Zhou’s perspective, his wife often interacted with her friends. It was only right that Gu Zhou was unhappy.

However, the situation was special now. It was not convenient for her to tell Gu Zhou that she was the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

Moreover, the fewer people who knew about this, the better. Only then would she be safer. That way, Gu Zhou would also be safer.

Gu Chuan’s dark and cold face suddenly flashed across Qiao Nian’s mind.

She still remembered how Gu Chuan had looked the last time he appeared.

Gu Chuan’s eyes were filled with possessiveness. He knew that he had lost her temper when she met Lu Zhu.
