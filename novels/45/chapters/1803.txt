Chapter 1804 - 1804 Complicated

Lina blushed. She wanted to leave, but she was too embarrassed to stay.

“I’ve already memorized everything the princess said just now. I hope what you said is true.”

When Lina heard Chen Qing’s words, she sat silently on a chair at the side. She did not dare to look at Chen Qing’s face and said in a low voice, “What I said just now was the truth.”

Hearing Lina’s words, Chen Qing’s face was filled with smiles. He struggled to get up and wanted to hug Lina directly, ignoring the pain on his body.

However, just as he reached out to hug Lina, the ward door opened.

The two of them were about to hug each other when they froze. Lina was the first to react. She helped Chen Qing lie down and stood up. She looked at the president at the door and touched her nose awkwardly. “Father? Are you done with your work?”

The President looked at his daughter’s shy face and then at Chen Qing, who was lying on the hospital bed. A trace of surprise flashed across his eyes, and his voice was a little unnatural. “Yes, everything has been arranged. I just remembered that Mr. Chen had taken a stab for me so I came to see how he was.”

The president pursed his lips with a complicated expression.

He wanted to see his savior and prepare some rewards for him.

Based on the situation of the two of them, he felt that the reward was useless.

He had never wanted his daughter to get married early.

Now that Wright had become a puppet, he could get his daughter to divorce him after a while. At that time, his daughter would be a treasure by his side.

But it was different now. Another man had taken a fancy to his daughter.

Chen Qing adjusted the head of the bed, and it slowly rose.

Chen Qing’s face was pale and he looked extremely fragile.

He said neither servile nor overbearing, “Thank you, President. Previously, in the hall, Second Young Madam had already treated my wound. My wound is fine.”

The scene gradually became awkward. For a moment, no one spoke.

Lina pursed her lips slightly and looked at her father, who had just walked in, and then at Chen Qing, who was lying on the hospital bed. The image of Chen Qing saving her repeatedly flashed through her mind, and her eyes gradually became firm.

Lina walked to the bed and grabbed Chen Qing’s hand. Chen Qing’s face was reflected in her clear eyes.

Under Chen Qing’s surprised gaze, she looked at the president not far away and said seriously, “Father, Chen Qing and I are in love. I thought I would tell you about this after Mark’s matter was settled, but…”

The President’s blue eyes narrowed slightly as he listened to Lina.

Although his daughter did not say it explicitly, he understood what she meant.

Previously, in order to find evidence of Mark’s crime, his daughter had voluntarily married Wright.

He knew very well that his daughter didn’t like Wright at all. On the contrary, she hated him.

At that time, his daughter was still willing to be his chess piece without hesitation.

The President looked at Lina in front of him with heartache. His gaze and his voice was gentle. “Lina, it’s my fault for not taking good care of you.”

His daughter’s uneasy explanation would only remind him of his incompetence at that time.

Moreover, Chen Qing was a good choice.

Lina was slightly stunned and looked at the president in disbelief.

No matter what, today was her and Wright’s wedding. This matter had already spread all over the world, but she was with another man tonight. This was against the rules.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The president looked at Lina’s uneasy appearance and waved at her.

Lina frowned slightly and blinked, not knowing if she should go over.

At this moment, Lina heard Chen Qing say, “Go.”

Lina subconsciously looked at Chen Qing and met his gentle black eyes.

Chen Qing slowly let go of Lina’s hand and nodded with a smile.
He had already made up his mind to be with Lina. Even if the president did not agree now, it did not matter. He would continue to work hard and wait until the day the president agreed.
