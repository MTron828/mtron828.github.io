769 Protecting You

If Gu Zhou was really cold-blooded and heartless towards Gu Qi and his childhood mommy, then she felt that Gu Zhou might not be a good person.

However, Gu Zhou was loyal. That was why he was living such a painful life.

It was also because of this that Gu Zhou was split into other personalitys.

Xiao Shi looked at Qiao Nian quietly and pursed her lips slightly. A quiet smile appeared on her face as she said, “Auntie Nian Nian, I think I understand now why Daddy likes you so much!”

Qiao Nian hadn’t expected to say such a thing . She smiled and asked with interest, “Why?” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Xiao Shi said with a serious expression, “You said these words so calmly because you don’t like Daddy. It’s precisely because you don’t like him that you won’t be worried about Mommy’s appearance, nor will you be worried that this will affect your relationship with Daddy.”

Qiao Nian was stunned. She hadn’t expected Xiao Shi to say that.

Without waiting for Qiao Nian to speak, Xiao Shi said solemnly, like a little adult, “In everyone’s opinion, it’s best if you can’t have it!”

At this moment, she was wearing Gu Qi’s clothes. She looked exquisite and cute, like a famous detective. One really couldn’t take their eyes off her.

Qiao Nian really liked Gu Zhou’s two children. They were so adorable and sensible that her heart ached.

Xiao Shi stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian. After a while, he said solemnly, “Auntie Nian Nian, actually, it doesn’t matter if you like Daddy or not. Since you’re the person Daddy likes, I’ll definitely do my best to protect you. I won’t let Mommy ruin your relationship with Daddy.”

When Qiao Nian heard Xiao Shi’s words, she couldn’t help but laugh. She asked curiously, “Xiao Shi, don’t you want your daddy and mommy to be together? That way, it’ll be easier for you to have a complete family.”

When he heard Qiao Nian’s question, he shook his head gently and said seriously, “Auntie Nian Nian, I’m a very principled person. Although I really want a family, if Daddy doesn’t like Mommy, I don’t want to force him either. Moreover, I’m already very happy to be able to see Daddy and Brother!”

Qiao Nian really hadn’t expected her to say such things. She was too obedient and sensible. She didn’t look like a child at all.

Perhaps many adults hoped that their children would be sensible, but in Qiao Nian’s opinion, sensible children must have suffered a lot in their hearts.

Qiao Nian smiled and said, “Alright, principled adult. Can you give me a token so that I can get someone to bring your mommy over!”

Xiao Shi put down the chopsticks in her hand and took off the pendant around her neck. Then, she handed the pendant to Qiao Nian with a serious expression and said, “Auntie Nian Nian, as long as your friend shows this pendant to my mommy, my mommy will believe your friend.”

Qiao Nian took the pendant and noticed that it was a light brown button. She was a little puzzled. Why would she wear a button like a pendant ?

However, it wasn’t appropriate for her to ask Xiao Shi directly.

Xiao Zheng said seriously, “This was a birthday gift Mommy specially gave me when I was four years old!”

Qiao Nian smiled lightly. The more she thought about it, the more she felt that the mommy she was talking about wasn’t her biological mother.

She had never heard or seen a birthday gift made of buttons before. Perhaps she was really ignorant!

Qiao Nian gently touched the button. Suddenly, an idea flashed across her mind. She seemed to have seen this button before, but she couldn’t remember.

However, Qiao Nian didn’t think too much about it. She put the button into her pocket.

Qiao Nian took out her phone and sent Lin Tao a text message, asking her to come over. She wanted Lin Tao to take care of Gu Qi.

While Qiao Nian was eating, she noticed that Xiao Shi was really only drinking pork rib soup. She even ate some vegetarian dishes and rice.

In the past, her heart ached for Gu Qi, who had never been taken care of. Now, her heart ached especially for Xiao Qi. She could tell that Xiao Qi had been taking care of others.

After dinner, Qiao Nian washed all the dishes. After she was done, her phone rang. It was Lin Tao calling her.
