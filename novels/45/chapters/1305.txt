1306 Doubts

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze, her left eyelid twitching. She frowned. “If someone comes to assassinate Gu Zhou… What if Eldest Senior Brother is here?”

When Chen Qing heard Qiao Nian say “Eldest Senior Brother”, he was stunned. Previously, he had heard from Second Young Master that Brother Li was the eldest senior brother of the clueless Young Madam.

Previously, Chang Feng had saved him and taught him martial arts. Chen Qing suddenly came back to his senses and asked, “Brother Feng might be back?”

Qiao Nian nodded and sighed. With a serious expression, she said, “When I met Eldest Senior Brother, he was being followed. Eldest Senior Brother is Mr. Chen’s right-hand man. The person who dared to follow Eldest Senior Brother is very likely Cui Huai.”

“Yes,” Gu Zhou replied.

Qiao Nian continued her analysis. “This proves that we didn’t meet Mr. Chen this time and ruined his original plan to kill you. Cui Huai must be even more suspicious of Mr. Chen!”

“Previously, when I came to MY, those people attacked me, but they never succeeded.” Gu Zhou frowned. “Those people were probably sent by Mr. Chen, but the mission failed.”

“If I were Cui Huai, I would definitely get the person I suspect to kill you. Cui Huai suspects Mr. Chen, which means that he might get Mr. Chen to kill you. However, Mr. Chen’s identity is sensitive. His every word and action represents Cui Huai. If he appears, even if he doesn’t say anything, everyone’s attention will be on Cui Huai. Cui Huai will be the target of suspicion.”

Qiao Nian’s mind raced. She frowned slightly and said sternly, “Cui Huai will definitely get Mr. Chen’s most trusted Chang Feng to kill you. That way, he can test Mr. Chen’s loyalty and kill you. It’s killing two birds with one stone. What we have to do is capture them alive. When that happens, Eldest Senior Brother will also be captured by us. Then, Eldest Senior Brother won’t have to go to Cui Huai anymore.”

Qiao Nian thought that as long as she caught Eldest Senior Brother, he would be able to escape Cui Huai’s clutches.

“If Chang Feng comes, I’m afraid we’ll have to let him go.” Gu Zhou raised a different opinion. In his free time, he picked up some vegetables for Qiao Nian. “He definitely won’t be willing to stay.”

“Why?” Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion.

“He wants to return to Big Brother’s side.” Gu Zhou was silent for a moment before saying softly.

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, her eyes darkened. Her heart was filled with complicated emotions.

If Eldest Senior Brother really came here to kill Gu Zhou, and if his mission failed, would he die when he returned?

Qiao Nian pursed her lips tightly, but she didn’t dare to risk Gu Zhou’s life. If she had the time, she could get a corpse and fake that it was Gu Zhou.

However, time was too tight. Cui Yong had just arrived. Perhaps the next wave of people would arrive as well.

Just as Qiao Nian was feeling flustered, her phone rang. She picked it up and saw that it was Qin Chuan calling. She picked up.

“Old Qin?” Qiao Nian called out.

Qin Chuan’s serious voice came from the cell phone.

Qiao Nian’s heart jumped to her throat. She pursed her lips tightly and remained silent.

“It should be Cui Huai’s men. Be careful now. I’ll get them to find everyone hiding in the dark.”

Sensing that Qin Chuan was about to hang up, Qiao Nian hurriedly gripped the phone tightly and said anxiously, “Also, remember to catch him alive. Perhaps Eldest Senior Brother is also inside.”

Qin Chuan was stunned for a moment before agreeing. “Okay!”

Qiao Nian had just hung up when the lights in the ward were instantly switched off.

The Interpol officers outside hurriedly tightened their grip on their guns and said loudly, “Everyone, pay attention. Someone is coming!” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Chen Qing walked to the door and looked out through the glass. Only then did he say to Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian, “Looks like they’re here. All the lights in the inpatient department have been turned off!”

The darkness was like a terrifying hand that gripped everyone’s hearts. The Interpol officers outside the door gripped the gun in his hand nervously, like a frightened bird.

Qiao Nian turned on the flashlight on her cell phone. The flashlight emitted a weak light. She looked at Gu Zhou and pursed her lips slightly. With a serious expression, she said, “They’re here now!”
