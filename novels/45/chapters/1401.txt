1402 Strange

Qiao Nian sat down obediently beside Matriarch Lu. She knew that Matriarch Lu was very upset now, but some things just happened. Uncle Zhao was the traitor. She could tell that Grandma couldn’t bear to part with Uncle Zhao, so she asked them to lock him up for the time being.

“When you were young, Old Master Zhao and Old Master had just retired. The two of them carried you wherever they went. They yearned to let the entire world know of your existence. At that time, if you wanted stars and the moon, they would definitely help you pluck them.”

At this point, Matriarch Lu heaved a sigh of relief and continued, “After you were kidnapped, Old Zhao had been looking for you outside. He only returned when the matter of your murder became a foregone conclusion. At that time, he had lost more than twenty kilograms. He stood there like a bamboo pole that would collapse with a gust of wind.”

As Qiao Nian listened to Matriarch Lu talk about the past, it was as if she had seen it with her own eyes. She felt that if there was such a loyal butler, she probably wouldn’t believe that the traitor was the butler either.

“After that, Qi Qi was born. He was worried that something would happen to Qi Qi. As long as he was free, he would stay by Qi Qi’s side and let Qi Qi ride on his neck. He would bring Qi Qi home to play every day. Tell me, how did he become like this?” The more Matriarch Lu thought about it, the sadder she became. She couldn’t understand how Old Zhao had become like this.

Qiao Nian looked up at Matriarch Lu and asked, “Grandma, how credible do you think Auntie Cao’s words are?”

Matriarch Lu sighed slightly. “She never lied in the past, and she doesn’t look like she’s lying this time. I don’t know what’s going on either.”

Qiao Nian comforted Matriarch Lu for a while longer. When Matriarch Lu was lying on the bed, she opened the door and left.

Qiao Nian didn’t return to her room. Instead, she went straight to the guest room Gu Zhou was in.

At this moment, Gu Zhou was lying on the bed in his bathrobe, his hair still a little wet. He patted the seat beside him and said, “Come over and sleep after taking a shower!”

“Okay.” Qiao Nian took the bathrobe into the bathroom. Just as she was about to close the door, she saw that Gu Zhou was already standing at the bathroom door. She looked at Gu Zhou in confusion, then closed and locked the door mercilessly.

She had been busy for the entire day, so she didn’t have time to fool around with him. As she took off her clothes, she said, “It’s getting late. If you’re tired, go to bed first!”

Gu Zhou was rejected. Silently, he turned around and got into bed, casually flipping open his cell phone.

Qiao Nian came out of the bathroom after taking a shower. She had also washed her hair and was wearing a dry hair hat. Naturally, she sat down beside Gu Zhou and said thoughtfully, “I think there’s something wrong with Uncle Zhao.”

Gu Zhou looked up at Qiao Nian and asked in confusion, “Why do you say that?”

“The Uncle Zhao was Grandma talking about might be an act, but Uncle Zhao could tell Auntie Cao calmly that he leaked Qi Qi’s schedule. That means that he didn’t hide anything from Auntie Cao.”

At this point, Qiao Nian took a deep breath and said again, “Uncle Zhao really treated the Lu family well in the past. How could a person have changed so much? If I remember correctly, his deceased wife has been dead for almost thirty years.”

Gu Zhou put down his phone and sat up straight, frowning slightly. “Are you saying that there’s more to this matter? But when we were at the kitchen door, Uncle Zhao’s hatred for the Lu family couldn’t be hidden at all.”

“Yes.” Qiao Nian nodded in agreement and continued, “I understand what you mean. I just took his pulse. His pulse is normal, but there seems to be something else in his body.”

“What do you mean?” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“There’s a living creature swimming in his veins.” This was also the first time Qiao Nian had seen such a situation. She looked at Gu Zhou and said, “I want to go to Qin Chuan’s house to look through Grandpa’s medical books. Perhaps I can investigate Uncle Zhao’s current situation.”

“Alright, I’ll accompany you.” Gu Zhou glanced at the time on his cell phone and said, “It’s getting late. Let’s rest early.”

“Yup.”
