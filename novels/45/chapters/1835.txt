“Sugar, we have to talk about some serious matters now.” Lu Zhu’s expression was serious. Seeing that Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian were also getting serious, he asked, “Just now, downstairs, you said that the First Madam and the Seventh Princess of Europe were coming to An City. Although we’ve already caught Mark and the crisis has been resolved, should we send someone to protect them? After all, there are always some restless people who want to cause trouble. ”

Lu Zhu did not say anything at the dining table just now, because he knew very well that even without Mark, if the people of other countries wanted to sow discord between Country Z and Europe, this was the best time to attack.

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Zhu’s question, a gentle smile appeared on her face.

Actually, she and Gu Zhou had thought about this before. As this involved the relationship between the two countries, the more people protecting Madam President and Lina, the better.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Qiao Nian nodded seriously, her eyes turning serious. “Brother, Madam President’s identity is really too special and sensitive. If anything goes wrong, it might affect the relationship between the two countries.”

“This time, Madam President was willing to come because she wanted to help us find out the truth about what happened back then as soon as possible and help us deal with those potential threats.”

She recalled the first time she had seen Madam President. She looked so weak, like a weak willow swaying in the wind. She was beautiful, but there was no light in her at all. Coupled with the fact that she had been drugged, she was still a little dazed.

“Madam President’s body is very weak. She doesn’t have many memories of An City, so after she comes here, I still have to try to help her regain her memories.” Qiao Nian pursed her lips slightly, frowning.

All these years, the President of Europe had been thinking of ways to treat Shen Mei’s illness, but Shen Mei’s health still did not improve.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian’s serious expression and knew that she was still worried about Madam President. He reached out and held Qiao Nian’s hand, as if he wanted to transfer his strength to her. He said softly, “Don’t worry, we’ve found Old Master Qin now. When the time comes, Old Master Qin will definitely have a way to help Madam President regain her memories.”

Qiao Nian turned to look at Gu Zhou, her lips curving up slightly. The worry in her eyes dissipated a lot.

Gu Zhou was right. Her master had returned to the country and his medical skills were so good. Perhaps he had a way to treat her illness.

Lu Zhu gently rubbed the jade ring on his finger and said, “In that case, contact Chen Qing. When the time comes, tell him when Madam President will arrive in Country Z. Our people can also go to the airport to protect Madam President.”

When Lu Jiang heard this, he smiled readily and said, “I arranged for many people to protect Sugar, but Sugar went home directly. I thought my arrangements might have been in vain. I didn’t expect them to be useful.” When Qiao Nian heard Lu Jiang’s words, she felt a little guilty. She hurriedly said, “I’m sorry, Fourth Brother. I really didn’t mean to waste your good intentions.”

“I know. You didn’t do it on purpose,” Lu Jiang said proudly.

Lu Rao glanced at Lu Jiang and said, “You’re not allowed to bully your sister. Be serious.”

Lu Jiang smiled and said nothing else.

Only then did Lu Rao retract his gaze. His gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face and he said solemnly, “This time, the problem is very serious. If anything happens to Madam President when she comes to An City this time, not only will the Lu family become the target of public criticism, but the friendship between

Country Z and Europe will also be affected.”

Before Lu Rao could finish his sentence, everyone understood what he meant.

Lu Zhu nodded in agreement. This matter could really be big or small. The Lu family had to treat it with utmost attention. “Ah Rao, you’re skilled. You’ve also protected the leaders of our country. Try your best to take time out to protect them, okay?”

Lu Rao smiled at Qiao Nian, who was sitting opposite him, his eyes filled with gentleness. “Sugar’s matter is my first priority. As long as Sugar needs me, I’m free at any time!”

When Lu Nian heard this, his eyes were filled with smiles. He leaned lazily on the sofa and sighed helplessly. “What a pity.. I won’t have the chance to help this time!”
