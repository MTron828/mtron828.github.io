Chapter 1734 - 1734 Pain

If a person grew up in a short period of time, it could only mean that they had experienced a lot in a short period of time and had no choice but to force themselves to grow up.

Chen Qing stuffed the pen into Wright’s hand and said sternly, “Sign it. After that, you’ll be free.”

Wright looked at Chen Qing fiercely. Just as he was about to say something, the gun was already pressed against his temple.

He couldn’t beat him.

Wright let out a long sigh. If only he could beat Chen Qing. Then he wouldn’t have to suffer so much.

Holding the pen, Wright stopped at the signature column. After thinking for a long time, he sneered at Chen Qing. “Chen Qing, actually, you don’t dare to kill me. All my men are outside. If I let them in to catch you… Ah!”

Before Wright could finish speaking, he saw a knife suddenly appear in Chen Qing’s hand, which was not holding a gun. The knife stabbed into the back of his hand and pierced through his entire palm.

Blood instantly stained the foot of the paper red. Lina hurriedly picked up the contract and carefully wiped the blood off the paper. Then, she placed it on a clean place. “Wright, do you really think your life is important? You’ll be the next Annie.”

Wright, who had been struggling in pain, froze when he heard Lina’s words.

Lina was right.

Mark seemed to feel sorry for Annie, but Mark did nothing to help her. He let Annie go crazy in court.

Wright slowly closed his eyes and opened them again. He looked up at Chen Qing and saw that he was looking at him coldly, as if he was looking at an inanimate object.

He couldn’t help but feel a chill run down his spine. At this moment, Wright felt that Chen Qing was like the Grim Reaper who had come to take his life.

Chen Qing bent down slightly and locked his gaze on Wright. He asked seriously, “Do you want to sign it?”

Wright’s lips trembled in pain, and he broke out in a cold sweat. However, when he thought of the almost insulting conditions in the contract, his expression turned even uglier. He said in a low voice, “No!”

“I really didn’t expect you to still dare to say no.” Chen Qing looked at Wright calmly and met his eyes. Seeing Wright’s indifference, he pulled out the knife in his hand and stabbed at the other side of his hand again. “What about now?”

“Ah!” Wright’s face twisted in pain, and tears welled up in his eyes.

Seeing that Wright’s hands were covered in blood, Via’s face turned paler and paler. She hid to the side.

She didn’t expect Mr. Chen to really dare to stab Wright’s hand with a knife.

With this thought in mind, Via looked up at Chen Qing and saw him standing “Are you going to sign it?”

Wright was so angry that his lips were trembling. If he really signed it, he would never be able to raise his head again.

He took a deep breath and shook his head. With a cold expression, he said, “No, I won’t sign… Ah!”

Without waiting for Wright to finish, Chen Qing stabbed him hard in the palm again. He listened to Wright’s scream and saw that the back of his hand was badly mangled. Blood had already stained the contract red.

“You dirtied the contract.” Chen Qing seemed to dislike Wright’s blood. He pulled out the knife and stabbed him again.

“Ah!” Wright was already trembling in pain. Panting heavily, he broke out in a cold sweat and stared unblinkingly at Chen Qing. If it weren’t for Chen Qing, he wouldn’t have been injured.

He wanted Chen Qing to die. He wanted to cut off every tendon on Chen Qing’s body with a knife and skin him alive. He wanted Chen Qing to die without a burial ground.

“Chen Qing, just you wait. I’ll definitely kill you. I’ll make you die a horrible death!” Wright howled. Tears welled up in his eyes. He yearned to kill Chen Qing.

Chen Qing said calmly, “This is just an appetizer and you can’t take it anymore. Aren’t you a little too weak?”𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

With that, Chen Qing looked at Lina, who was standing at the side, gently. His tone was much gentler as he said, “Seventh Princess, Wright dirtied the contract you wrote. Please write it again. There’s no hurry. I’ll communicate with Wright properly.”

Lina looked into Chen Qing’s eyes and couldn’t help but blush. Smiling, she lowered her gaze.
