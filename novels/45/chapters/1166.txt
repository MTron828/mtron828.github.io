1167 I won’t give birth anymore

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou mention the child, she frowned and said softly, “What about you?”

Thank you readers!

“I hope it’s a girl.” At this point, Gu Zhou couldn’t help but smile. He looked down at Qiao Nian, who was in his arms. Meeting her sparkling eyes, he lowered his head and kissed her forehead. “I hope she looks a little like you.”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou, fantasizing about a little child who looked similar to her. Her heart couldn’t help but soften.

When she was young, she had grown up in the village. She had heard from all the men in the village that they hoped their children looked like them, because they never liked children who looked like their mothers.

In the past, she didn’t understand this. Only when she grew up did she realize that the men in the village were all chauvinists and didn’t take women to heart at all.

!!

But Gu Zhou was different. Gu Zhou must have loved her dearly, so he hoped that the child would look like her.

Qiao Nian moved closer to Gu Zhou’s lips and kissed him lightly.

“If that child doesn’t look like you, then you can give birth again until we get someone who looks like you.” Gu Zhou’s eyes were sparkling, as if there was a sea of stars in them.

Qiao Nian frowned slightly and punched Gu Zhou’s chest unhappily. Smiling, she retorted, “What nonsense are you spouting? I’m not a pig!”

“Actually, being a pig isn’t bad either.” Gu Zhou smiled and hugged Qiao Nian tightly. He moved closer to Qiao Nian’s forehead and kissed her gently. “You can give birth to a lot at once.”

“If you want to give birth, go ahead. I won’t give birth anymore!”

In Qiao Nian’s opinion, having three children was enough.

Qiao Nian curled up in Gu Zhou’s arms. It seemed that Gu Zhou was also thinking about his child like her.

Qiao Nian found a very comfortable position in his arms. She sighed slightly and said, “Sleep!”

No matter how much they missed the child now, it was just wishful thinking. They had to find clues about those people as soon as possible. That way, they could find the child as soon as possible.

“Yes,” Gu Zhou replied.

Qiao Nian stayed in Gu Zhou’s arms and slowly closed her eyes. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Actually, she was also very greedy for Gu Zhou’s embrace. She would only feel at ease in his arms.

Sometimes, habits were really scary. If she didn’t have him by her side, she might not be able to sleep.

Gu Zhou patted Qiao Nian’s back gently, as if he was coaxing a child to sleep.

Qiao Nian’s eyelids grew heavier and heavier. In the end, she let out long and even breathing.

Qiao Nian passed through the foggy forest and saw a church not far away.

Qiao Nian looked at Lu Qi in confusion, not understanding what she was talking about.

“Sister, could it be that you’ve overslept and forgotten that today is your wedding ceremony?”

Qiao Nian nodded in confusion and followed Lu Qi into the church. She saw a man standing in front of her godfather.

From behind, the man’s figure and aura were exactly the same as Gu Zhou’s.

So today was her wedding to Gu Zhou.

Qiao Nian looked down at herself. She was indeed wearing a beautiful wedding dress.

She had almost missed her wedding.

Holding Qiao Nian’s arm, Lu You walked towards the stage. When he reached the stage, the groom turned to look at him in disbelief.

What was going on?

Why had the groom become Mr. Chen?

Where had Gu Zhou gone?

Qiao Nian stood on the stage in a daze. She was about to speak to Lu You when he disappeared.

Qiao Nian looked at the guests sitting below. She could feel their blessings, but she couldn’t see their faces clearly.

“From today onwards, we’re husband and wife. I’ll take good care of you!” As Mr. Chen spoke, he took Qiao Nian’s hand and was about to put on a diamond ring for her!

Qiao Nian subconsciously wanted to retract her hand. She didn’t want to marry Mr. Chen. She just wanted to marry Gu Zhou. She suddenly realized something terrifying. Her body was out of her control.

Qiao Nian took a deep breath. She wanted to speak, but a gunshot suddenly came from the door!
