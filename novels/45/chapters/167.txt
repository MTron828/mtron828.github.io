Chapter 168 Apologizing

To the people at the venue, Jiang Yue’s incident was just a small interlude. The host quickly stood up and invited the third speaker to the stage to give their speech.

Thinking of Jiang Yue’s state just now, Matriarch Gu grew extremely worried. S began walking towards the changing room.

Qiao Nian had been staying by Matriarch Gu’s side. Since Matriarch Gu was not in good health, she was worried that something would happen to her. She said softly, “Grandma, I’ll go with you!”

Matriarch Gu’s heart skipped a beat. Her gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face, and her heart seemed to be clenched tightly by an invisible hand.

This child must have suffered a lot in the

past!

Silently, she endured the unfairness of everything, but on the surface, she pretended that nothing was wrong. Matriarch Gu held onto Qiao Nian’s hand. Her eyes were red-rimmed as she said gently, “Nian Nian, you don’t have to accept someone you don’t like for my sake. You just have to follow your heart.”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She could sense her grandmother’s love for her. “Grandma.”

For the first time, Qiao Nian didn’t know what to say.

“You should blossom with your own unique light. You don’t have to live under anyone’s shadow. As long as you live freely according to your whims and follow your heart, that will do,” Matriarch Gu said gently.

Hearing Matriarch Gu’s words, Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat. She felt intensely touched. Pursing her lips, she nodded with a smile.

Matriarch Gu pursed her lips and gently patted Qiao Nian’s hand, then walked towards the changing room.

Matriarch Gu had only taken a few steps when she saw Jiang Yue coming out.

“Grandmother.”

Jiang Yue was wearing the purple gown. After tidying up a little, her disheveled appearance had disappeared, leaving behind only a gentle

aura.

No one had expected Jiang Yue to regain her composure and step out in public once again after making such a huge fool of herself. It seemed that Jiang Yue was a very strong-willed person.

Matriarch Gu had initially wanted to scold Jiang Yue, but when she recalled how pitiful Jiang Yue had looked on stage just now, she hesitated.

However, Matriarch Gu did not want to forgive Jiang Yue so quickly either, as she was worried that Jiang Yue would become increasingly disobedient in the future. Hence, she said coldly, “Why haven’t you gotten lost?”

Jiang Yue’s eyes were red. She pursed her lips. She had to regain all the dignity she had lost today. She walked up to Qiao Nian and gave a respectful perpendicular bow. “Sister Nian Nian, I brought all of this upon myself. I’ve let you down. Not only did I ruin your gown, but I also ruined Grandma’s good intentions. I’m really sorry. I hope you can forgive me. I’ll fix the gown as soon as possible.”

When the onlookers heard Jiang Yue’s words, they were all astonished. “Senior Jiang Yue lowered herself to apologize. Looks like she truly knows that she’s in the wrong!”

“Sigh, Senior Jiang Yue has been so humiliated just now. She’s been punished enough. After all, this was all a misunderstanding from the beginning!”

“Actually, there’s nothing wrong with Senior Jiang Yue mistaking the gown to be hers. After all, Matriarch Gu only used to make gowns for her in the past. Most people would definitely think that the gown Grandma made was meant for them.”

“Yes, yes, yes. It’s human nature!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Professor Qiao, why don’t you forgive Senior Jiang Yue?”

“Yes, yes. It was just a misunderstanding back then. Now that the misunderstanding has been cleared and Senior Jiang Yue has apologized, please forgive her!”

Qiao Nian’s eyes were as cool as water. She stood there silently, looking at Jiang Yue without a word.

Not only did Matriarch Gu, who was standing at the side, not heave a sigh of relief, but her frown grew deeper and deeper. Her eyes were filled with complicated emotions.

“Just because you’ve apologized, does that mean she has to accept your apology?”

Suddenly, a magnetic male voice rang out from the side, filled with sarcasm.

Everyone looked over. They didn’t expect the speaker to be Gu Zhou!

Gu Zhou had a hand in his pocket. He exuded a cold aura that made one subconsciously retreat several steps away.
