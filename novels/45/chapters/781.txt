782 Thank You

“Xiao Qi?” Seeing that Gu Qi was silent, Gu Zhou called out tentatively.

Xiao Shi suddenly retracted her thoughts. Her gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face and she nodded. She said eagerly, “Of course I’m willing. Moreover, as long as Daddy likes her, I have no objections!”

Seeing the serious expression in Gu Qi’s eyes, the nervousness in Gu Zhou’s heart gradually dissipated.

Actually, he cared a lot about Gu Qi’s opinion. If Gu Qi was unwilling, he could only work harder to make Gu Qi accept Qiao Nian.

“Thank you, Xiao Qi. Don’t worry, when I’m with your Auntie Nian Nian in the future, the two of us will take good care of you!”

A bright smile appeared on Xiao Shi’s face. Her beautiful fox-like eyes flickered as she said softly, “Thank you, Daddy!”

Gu Zhou’s expression faltered slightly. He didn’t understand why Gu Qi would say that.

He should be the one thanking Gu Qi for this.

“Why are you thanking me?”

When he smiled when he was young, his eyes narrowed into crescents. “Daddy is very honest with me now, and he didn’t lie to me! Other fathers will lie to children!”

When Gu Zhou heard Gu Qi’s words, he couldn’t help but hug him tightly and say softly, “You’re my child. There shouldn’t be any secrets between us!”

Although he said that, he hoped that Gu Qi could be as innocent as other children and be himself easily. He didn’t have to think about so many things, nor did he need to please other.

Would other children think about such complicated things?

After dinner, Xiao Shi slept in Gu Qi’s room. She lay on the bed and took out her phone to call Brother Xiao Qi.

When the call went through, her feet swayed non-stop.

At this moment, she really looked like a young lady.

Pure and innocent.

“Brother!” Xiao Shi called out excitedly, her eyes filled with smiles.

At this moment, Gu Qi was wearing pajamas. He sat on the bed and looked at the smile on his face on the phone. He couldn’t help but smile.

“Sister, were you exposed over there today?”

Xiao Shi smiled and shook her head. “I’m so smart. Of course I won’t let Daddy discover anything wrong!”

“How did Dad treat you today?”

At this point, the smile on Xiao Shi’s face grew brighter and brighter. She seemed to be surrounded by bubbles of happiness.

“Daddy treats me very well. I’m very happy!” At this point, a thought flashed across her mind. She hurriedly said, “Brother, Dad even asked me a question today. I’ve already answered it for you, but I think I should tell you!”

“What question?”

Xiao Shi said, “Daddy asked me today if you were willing to let Auntie Nian Nian be your mommy.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

When he heard Xiao Shi mention this, Gu Qi’s expression couldn’t help but turn serious.

His other hand gripped the bedsheets under him tightly. He asked nervously, “Then how did you tell Daddy?”

“I said I’m willing!” Xiao Shi looked at Gu Qi with a smile and asked, “Brother, am I right to answer like this?”

Gu Qi heaved a sigh of relief and nodded. “Yes!”

“Brother, am I especially smart?” Xiao Shi asked.

“Yes.” Gu Qi lowered his gaze, his eyes dark. He didn’t dare to look at Xiao Shi. After a long while, he asked carefully, “Sister, will you blame me? If I refuse, Dad and Mommy might…”

When Xiao Qing heard Gu Qi’s words, she hurriedly shook her head and said, “Brother Xiao Qi, what are you saying? Of course I won’t blame you!”

Gu Qi looked at Xiao Shi in confusion. “Why?”

“You’re my brother. Of course I’ll respect your choice!” Xiao Shi gave a bright smile.

“Previously, you told me that Mommy often misses me at night. But now, I want Auntie Nian Nian to be my mommy. Today, Auntie Lin Tao told me that they can’t stay together. In other words, it’s impossible for Auntie Nian Nian to be with Mommy. If Auntie Nian Nian is my mommy, doesn’t that mean that I’ve already betrayed our mommy?” When Gu Qi said this, he felt guilty. He felt that he had let down the mommy who had given birth to him.
