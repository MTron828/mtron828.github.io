1408 What a Pity

Allen glanced at Wei Hao and frowned. “Sigh, what a pity.”

Wei Hao’s expression changed drastically. He hurriedly said, “Why are you sighing? What a pity? What’s wrong with me? Can’t I go out?”

“Don’t you know what you did previously?” Allen asked.

Wei Hao looked innocent and said, “I can only stay in prison every day and work hard. Other than that, what else can I do?”

Allen looked at Wei Hao coldly and said in disappointment, “I’m sorry, I have other things to do. I don’t have time to waste with you!”

Seeing that Allen was about to turn around and leave, Wei Hao hurriedly called out, “Mr. Allen, don’t leave yet. I have something to say. Let’s discuss it further!”

Allen stood there calmly and glanced at the time on his wrist. He said coldly, “I still have a minute!”

“I remember now. I remember everything,” Wei Hao said eagerly.

Wei Hao knew in his heart that after the chauffeur incident, he could leave in a few years. However, he would probably have to stay here for the rest of his life because of the Lu family.

Now that the Lu family had finally relented and was willing to let him out, he couldn’t wait to confess everything. “It’s like this. A few days ago, Old Zhao came to visit me. If it weren’t for him, how could I have stayed in there for the rest of my life? I was very angry, so I deliberately told him that his wife had cheated on him. The child belongs to Old Master Lu. I wanted him to feel terrible. Who asked him to make me stay here for the rest of my life!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

When Uncle Zhao heard Wei Hao’s words, his eyes turned red and tears welled up in his eyes.

When Allen heard Wei Hao tell him everything, he asked calmly, “Do you still want to go out?”

Wei Hao’s eyes lit up. He nodded vigorously.

Due to Old Master Lu’s instructions, his wife and son could not visit him. He had been in prison for too long. After he went out, he only wanted to see his family!

“I really want to go out.” At the thought that he would be able to see his wife and son soon, Wei Hao’s voice choked. “I really want to see my family.”

He was alive, but he couldn’t meet his family. How painful was that!

Allen said lightly, “Eldest Young Master has already said that if you really want to come out, we’ll talk after you die!”

The expression on Wei Hao’s face froze for a moment, and the sorrow gradually faded. His eyes were red with anger as he questioned loudly, “How dare you lie to me?”

“I hope you can make it clear who taught you those words. If you don’t say it, you’ll probably never see the sun next month!” Allen smiled and clapped his hands gently. At this moment, the door opened.

A person in a police uniform walked in. When Wei Hao saw that person, the blood drained from his face.

“Hell King Ning?” Wei Hao’s voice trembled.

Hell King Ning was the Hell King of prison. All prisoners would not survive a month under his hands.

Hell King Ning’s torture methods were very ruthless, but the forensic doctor couldn’t find any problems with them.

When Allen saw Hell King Ning, he said very politely, “Officer Ning, although Wei Hao is in prison, he deliberately sowed discord between Butler Zhao and the Lu family and almost killed Young Miss Lu. Perhaps it’s because he has a grudge against the Lu family that he got someone to set up a bomb in the Wang Village Tunnel. The explosion in the Wang Village Tunnel killed many people. This matter is very serious. I heard that you’re a god at solving cases. I think if I hand this matter to you, the truth will definitely come out soon.”

“Okay.”

When the recording ended, Uncle Zhao’s frown deepened. He frowned slightly and said, “I remember someone writing me a note a few days ago.”

“Where’s the note?” Qiao Nian asked.

“In order not to leave any traces, I burned it.” Uncle Zhao leaned back in his chair loosely, his eyes filled with despair. “It said, ‘The child in your wife’s stomach is Old Master Lu.’”
