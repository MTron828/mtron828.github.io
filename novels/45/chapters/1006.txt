1007 Sleepy

But she felt that something was wrong.

Ordinary families had parents living with their children. Why did they have to move out?

Before Qiao Nian could speak, she heard Gu Zhou say, “I think you should consider this matter carefully. You shouldn’t make a decision too early. Aren’t you going to the Lu family tomorrow? Shouldn’t you prepare something today?”

“Okay.” At the thought of going to the Lu family, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but feel nervous.

She wondered how the Lu family would react.

Gu Zhou could already tell that Qiao Nian was very nervous, so he began. “I’ll go with you to prepare a gift in the afternoon.”

“I suddenly realized that you’re very considerate.”

“I’ll only be considerate to you!”

When Qiao Nian heard this, her ears turned red. She reached out and pushed Gu Zhou away, smiling. “It’s getting late. Let’s get up quickly!”

… .

Gu Zhou brought Qiao Nian to the mall. When Qiao Nian looked around at the dazzling items, she hesitated again.

She didn’t know what the Lu family liked, nor did she know what would make them happy.

Seeing Qiao Nian’s hesitation, Gu Zhou smiled and said, “Actually, you don’t have to prepare anything. They’re already very happy to know that you’re alive and well.”

“I know what you mean, but I still want to prepare something for them to express my gratitude.”

As Qiao Nian spoke, she stood there in deep thought.

The Lu family had eaten all kinds of delicacies. Gold, silver, and jade artifacts were not lacking to them.

Qiao Nian felt that she should give her something that the Lu family didn’t have, or something rare.

She had cultivated those Chinese herbs, so it should be better to give these to her.

However, she still went in with Gu Zhou to pick out some things, thinking of giving each of them a small gift.

At night, Qiao Nian lay in bed, tossing and turning.

The thought of meeting the Lu family tomorrow and acknowledging her ancestors made her unable to calm down.

Gu Zhou hugged Qiao Nian tightly and patted her back gently. He comforted her in a low voice, “Don’t worry, I’ll always be with you.”

Gu Zhou’s words seemed to have a magical power, gradually calming Qiao Nian’s uneasy heart.

She would let nature take its course. Moreover, Gu Zhou would always be with her.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian smiled at Gu Zhou and said gently, “Why aren’t you sleeping? Why are you looking at me?”

Gu Zhou met Qiao Nian’s eyes and swallowed. He couldn’t help but kiss Qiao Nian’s forehead.

In the past, she had heard that that was all there was to it between men and women.

However, only after experiencing it personally would one understand.

He had thought that Qiao Nian would go to the Lu family tomorrow. It might be a little inconvenient for them to do it today.

Gu Zhou’s eyes gradually darkened.

Seeing Gu Zhou’s gaze, Qiao Nian gasped and hurriedly said, “It’s getting late. I’m sleepy. I’m going to sleep!”

The next morning, when Qiao Nian woke up, there was no one around. She glanced at the time. It was seven in the morning.

She really hadn’t expected Gu Zhou to wake up so early.

However, Qiao Nian didn’t have time to think about anything else. The thought of going to the Lu family later made her nervous.

She dressed up carefully before leaving.

When she reached the corner of the stairs, she saw the butler talking to the servants.

When the butler and servant saw Qiao Nian, their expressions froze for a moment, but they quickly regained their composure.

“Where did Second Young Master go?”

The butler said respectfully, “Second Young Madam, Second Young Master is in the study now.”

Qiao Nian nodded. Just as she was about to go to the study, the butler stopped her.

“Second Young Madam, Second Young Master was very strange last night.”

When Qiao Nian heard the butler’s words, a trace of worry flashed in her eyes. She asked worriedly, “How was he strange?”

“Second Young Master woke up at around three in the morning. He looked very pale and especially haggard. He even said that he couldn’t sleep. Second Young Madam, has Second Young Master’s illness worsened again?” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Yes, I understand.” Qiao Nian frowned slightly.

“In the past, Second Young Master would drink calming tea when he had insomnia, but this time, it’s very strange. He drank those cold drinks.” The more the butler spoke, the more worried he became. Second Young Master had never liked cold drinks in the past.
