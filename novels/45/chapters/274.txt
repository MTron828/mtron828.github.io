Chapter 275: Goddess

When Qiao Nian heard Gao Lin’s question, she pursed her lips slightly and raised her eyebrows. She asked, “Can’t I come to this training room?”

When Xia Xue heard Gao Lin call the girl “Qiao Nian”, her eyes flickered.

Why did she find this name familiar?

Oh.

Oh, right.

She remembered.

Qiao Nian seemed to be the self-taught student Gao Lin had mentioned, the one who could perfectly play “Spring and Snow”.

Xia Xue couldn’t help but size Qiao Nian up. Her eyes gradually lit up.

Even though she had high standards, she had to admit that Qiao Nian was very beautiful.

Her long, black hair looked like glossy seaweed under the sunlight. Her facial features were exquisite and well-defined, especially her beautiful fox-like eyes. One couldn’t help but not look away.

Coupled with Qiao Nian’s tall and sexy figure, the dress she was wearing perfectly accentuated her S-shaped curves.

Xia Xue’s eyes darkened slightly. Not only was Qiao Nian good-looking, but she also played the zither well. Xia Xue instantly felt a sense of danger.

The other students were also staring unblinkingly at Qiao Nian, their eyes filled with admiration.

All of them were amazed.

What a beautiful girl. She looked as if she had walked out of a painting!

Even Xia Xue, the school belle, paled in comparison.

Even if the school belle were to stand in front of her, she would be reduced to an unremarkable backdrop.

It seemed that the new campus belle would be replaced.

Gao Lin clenched her fists tightly. Seeing how fearless Qiao Nian was, her anger surged. She said angrily, “I think you’re doing this on purpose. You knew that Sister Xia Xue would be practicing the violin here, but you insisted on causing trouble.”

Qiao Nian looked at Gao Lin in confusion and asked, “Who set the rule that only Xia Xue can enter this training room? No one else can.”

With that, Qiao Nian glanced at the students surrounding Xia Xue. She looked even more confused. Puzzled, she asked, “Why can they all come, but I can’t?”

Gao Lin’s face turned red. She didn’t know what to say.

Qiao Nian looked aggrieved. She continued, “If you want to see Mr. Dong Hua’s charm, can’t I?”

“You…” Gao Lin was so angry that she wanted to argue with Qiao Nian, but she was stopped by Xia Xue. Reluctantly, she shut her mouth.

When the students who had come to watch the show saw Qiao Nian like this, their hearts ached for her. They nodded instantly.

“Yes, yes. Qiao Nian, don’t be sad. Of course, you can look at Mr. Dong Hua too!”

“Student Qiao Nian, don’t be sad. When Mr. Dong Hua comes out later, you’ll be the first to take a look, right?”

“Student Qiao Nian, can you give me your contact information?”

“I want one too!”

“And me!”

…

Seeing Qiao Nian surrounded by her classmates, a trace of gloom flashed in Xia Xue’s eyes.

When she was selected as the school belle, she had never seen anyone so excited that they asked for her contact information on the spot.

Xia Xue clenched her fists lightly. She was the focus of everyone’s attention.

Xia Xue looked at Qiao Nian, then at the students. Smiling, she tried to smooth things over. “Alright, everyone, quiet down. Mr. Dong Hua doesn’t like noise!”

Hearing Xia Xue’s words, everyone fell silent.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Xia Xue’s face. She asked curiously, “When I was inside just now, I heard from you that Mr. Dong Hua was here. Where is he? I want to see my idol too!”

Xia Xue gave Gao Lin a look. Gao Lin took a step forward arrogantly and questioned angrily, “Didn’t you hear Mr. Dong Hua play the violin just now?” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

When Qiao Nian heard Gao Lin’s words, she looked puzzled. She asked, “Did I?”

The other enthusiastic classmates hurriedly nodded and said, “Student Qiao Nian, Mr. Dong Hua was playing the violin in a private room just now!”

“Mr. Dong Hua really did!”

“Student Qiao Nian, you just came out of the piano room. You should be closer to the other rooms. Didn’t you hear him?”
