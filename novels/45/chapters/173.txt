Chapter 174 Cuckold?

Gu Zhou’s gaze was a little frightening… Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Nian didn’t know when Gu Zhou had arrived, but she was certain that he had heard the contents of her call.

“… About that, actually… I…”

For the first time, Qiao Nian felt awkward.

What should she say?

She had been flirting with another man in front of her legal husband.

Looking at Qiao Nian, Gu Zhou advanced towards her step by step. He narrowed his phoenix-like eyes and stared down at Qiao Nian’s mouth.

If he had not heard it with his own ears, he would never have believed that Qiao Nian’s mouth would ever be able to spout such sweet, charming words. Most of the time, she couldn’t be bothered to even open that mouth of hers.

And she even knew how to play the part of the coquette!

She didn’t even speak coquettishly to him!

Qiao Nian’s back broke out into a cold sweat under Gu Zhou’s glare. She lowered her head guiltily, not daring to look at Gu Zhou.

“Mrs. Gu, who are you meeting tomorrow?”

His voice was cold, and his gaze was piercing to the bone. Suppressing his anger, he spoke in a tone that made Qiao Nian’s scalp go numb, especially when Gu Zhou addressed her as Mrs. Gu.

The atmosphere in the room turned awkward. The air seemed to have frozen over.

Qiao Nian sensed the pressure mounting. Carefully, she looked up at Gu Zhou and said hesitantly, “Actually, this is just a misunderstanding.”

“Misunderstanding?” Gu Zhou raised an eyebrow, his thin lips parting as he questioned her, his voice chilling.

“It’s really a misunderstanding. I definitely didn’t…”

Before Qiao Nian could finish her sentence, Gu Zhou interrupted her. “Mrs. Gu has never even invited me to spend a night in a suite, has she?”

Qiao Nian: “?”

Why did she feel that Gu Zhou’s words were tinged with sourness?

No.

Definitely not.

She must have misheard.

“Um, in that case, why don’t I take you there next time?” Qiao Nian asked softly.

Gu Zhou frowned. His voice was low and slightly hoarse. “Are you saying that I can’t afford a luxury suite?”

Qiao Nian was stunned. What did Gu Zhou mean by that? However, she quickly understood. Gu Zhou wanted her to make things clear.

Qiao Nian gave it some serious thought, struggling with where to begin.

“Or could it be that Mrs. Gu thinks that wearing a green hat will suit me?”[1]

Hearing Gu Zhou’s words, Qiao Nian’s thoughts began to follow in that direction. For a few moments, she fantasized about Gu Zhou being made a cuckold. With that universally hated face of Gu Zhou’s, he would look good even in a green hat.

No!

What was she thinking?

She had never thought of making Gu Zhou a cuckold.

Gu Zhou seemed to have already read Qiao Nian’s mind. He bent down slightly and moved his gaze closer to Qiao Nian. He asked again, “So, do I look good?”

Qiao Nian was a little flustered by Gu Zhou’s words. She took a step back and looked up at Gu Zhou, saying firmly, “Why don’t you come with me tomorrow?”

Gu Zhou was slightly stunned. The anger in his eyes dissipated. “What?”

“To watch a good show!”

Gu Zhou’s thin lips curved up slightly. “Alright.”

Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief, thinking that she had finally managed to get Gu Zhou off her back. “I’ll make some medicine for Grandma.”

With that, Qiao Nian walked past Gu Zhou. However, Gu Zhou’s next sentence made Qiao Nian turn as red as a lobster.

“Mrs. Gu, I’m a little curious. What do you sound like when you’re flirting in your own voice?” Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian intently, his eyes burning.

Qiao Nian’s breath caught in her throat. She tilted her head back to look up at Gu Zhou, feeling as if she was being sucked in by Gu Zhou’s gaze. Her face grew even redder.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian’s flushed face. His heart lightened, and he felt a little happier.

“I-I have something on,” Qiao Nian stammered. “I’ll leave first.”

With that, Qiao Nian fled.

Gu Zhou gazed at Qiao Nian’s retreating back. His beautiful phoenix-like eyes narrowed, and a faint smile appeared on his lips. His eyes seemed to grow ever more bottomless.

His irises, dark as ink, were sparkling with dazzling starlight.

Gu Zhou’s breathing quickened as he stepped out of the room.

“Second Young Master.”

A delicate voice came from behind him. Gu Zhou turned around and saw Wang Miao looking at him shyly.
