Chapter 400: Heartless

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian was slightly taken aback. Gu Zhou had already unbuttoned three buttons on his shirt, so she could clearly see his sexy and perfect collarbone. She could even vaguely see his chest muscles. If he unbuttoned all of them, then below would be…

Qiao Nian hurriedly put away her impure thoughts. Her mouth was a little dry. She pursed her lips slightly and asked, “Why are you taking off your clothes?”

Gu Zhou’s hand, which was unbuttoning his shirt, paused for a moment. Then, he said matter-of-factly, “For the massage!”

Qiao Nian didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. This wasn’t acupuncture. “You don’t have to take off your clothes for a massage.”

“Oh,” Gu Zhou replied. He sat casually on the sofa and did not button up his shirt again.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou. His lazy appearance coupled with his barely visible chest muscles, made him look seductive.

This man was really monstrous.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou, then at the bed. “Sit here!”

“Got it.”

Gu Zhou nodded and sat down obediently on the bed, his back facing Qiao Nian.

For some reason, Qiao Nian felt that Gu Zhou was different from usual today, but she couldn’t tell what was different.

Qiao Nian stood behind Gu Zhou and placed her hands on his shoulders. At first, she didn’t apply much pressure, but then she gradually increased the pressure.

Qiao Nian massaged his shoulders, suddenly realizing that something was amiss.

Gu Zhou looked very much like Zhou Zhou who was obedient and well-behaved.

“Where did you go this morning?” Gu Zhou asked.

Reading on Mybo xn o vel. com ,Please!

Qiao Nian continued massaging and said casually, “I went to a kindergarten.”

Gu Zhou’s gaze was complicated as he asked, “Why did you go to a kindergarten?”

“To look for Mr. Qin.”

“Qin Chuan?”

“Yes, you previously asked me to find an item to prepare for the auction, so I took the painting and went to look for him!”

Gu Zhou frowned slightly. Qiao Nian seemed to be telling the truth, because Qin Chuan was indeed the principal of the kindergarten.

However, this matter involved Gu Qi, so he had to ask clearly, “Did you speak up for a child in kindergarten?”

Qiao Nian stopped massaging him. She didn’t understand how Gu Zhou knew.

Right!

Qin Lu must have told him about this.

Qiao Nian remembered that Gu Zhou had once asked her if she liked children. She still remembered the answer.

I don’t like them.

Qiao Nian didn’t want Gu Zhou to know about her relationship with Gu Qi.

“When I went to kindergarten today, I saw Qin Lu bullying a little boy. Her words were a little unpleasant. I really couldn’t stand it anymore, so I pretended to be a child’s relative and taught Qin Lu a lesson. Due to this, she was fired by Mr. Qin, so Qin Lu was unhappy with me.”

A trace of doubt flashed across Gu Zhou’s heart. Could it really be just a coincidence?

“I remember you saying you didn’t like children.”

“It’s one thing not to like children, but I can’t let an adult bully them.”

Gu Zhou had originally thought that Qiao Nian had specially gone to the kindergarten to help Gu Qi teach Qin Lu a lesson.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion. “What’s wrong?”

“Nothing.”

“That’s strange. I don’t remember you being like this in the past. This is the first time I’ve seen you so gossipy, and you keep asking about that child. Do you know him?”

Gu Zhou’s expression was calm, and his voice did not waver at all. “He belongs to my friend’s family. I’ve seen him a few times in the past.”

“Friend?”

Qiao Nian’s expression darkened.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian in confusion. “Why do you look like this?”

“Nothing. I just didn’t expect you to have such a heartless friend.” Qiao Nian frowned.

Gu Zhou was confused. Heartless?

Gu Zhou suppressed his temper and asked, “Huh? What happened?”

“He’s a boy, but his father doesn’t care about him at all. He always thought that his father liked girls and even specially wore girls’ clothes! This is simply too much. If this isn’t heartless, what is?”
