1173 Poisoned?

The group went to the funeral parlor. Li Jun didn’t come because he had something on, so he asked his secretary to follow along.

Qiao Nian had already spoken to Xiao Xiao, who worked at the funeral parlor. The funeral of Dr. Shen was held very simply. Li Jun’s secretary followed the Lu family to pay respects to Dr. Shen.

In the evening, everyone left.

Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou brought the Lu family to the Dongjiang villa. Shen An was lying on the sofa with a frown, as if he had a nightmare.

Su Yan looked at Shen An’s face in confusion. Puzzled, she asked, “Why did you let Teacher fake his death?”

!!

“Mom, I think Dr. Shen should know the truth about what happened back then. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been poisoned,” Qiao Nian said with certainty.

“What? Teacher has been poisoned?” Su Yan frowned and looked at Shen An worriedly.

The other members of the Lu family looked at Shen An with complicated expressions. Lu Yan walked over to Su Yan and asked in a low voice, “I remember that Dr. Shen gave you a USB flash drive. Open it now and take a look.”

Su Yan inserted the USB drive into the computer Qiao Nian had brought over. There was only one video on the USB drive. Su Yan opened the video and the Lu family surrounded her.

Shen An’s face appeared in the video. He looked at the camera, as if adjusting his posture.

Shen An was wearing a suit, and his hair was combed neatly. He looked at the camera and adjusted its position. Only then did he say with a guilty expression, “Yan’er, I’m sorry.”

Shen An’s words caused ripples in everyone’s hearts. Su Yan held Lu You’s hand tightly with her right hand and frowned at the screen.

“All those years ago, it was all Teacher’s fault. It was really a mistake. Every step I took was wrong. If only…” When Shen An spoke up to here, he paused, and his face was filled with regret. He raised his hand to cover his eyes, but tears still fell down his face.

Qiao Nian’s breathing quickened as she looked at Shen An’s face. In a daze, she seemed to have seen Shen An before, but she couldn’t remember

Shen An was silent for about three minutes before he spoke again. “I… Sigh, I have to start from the kidnapping of my daughter.”

“Those people captured my daughter. They all wore masks and took me somewhere. I don’t know where that is either. They wanted me to undergo a bone marrow transplant and…”

Shen An frowned and massaged his temples with both hands. He thought for a long time. “They also wanted me to perjure myself.”

Shen An took a deep breath and looked into the camera. He blinked and massaged his temples twice. “Yan’er, I don’t know if you’ll have the chance to see these videos. My brain isn’t working well now either. I often forget things. I…”

After Shen An finished speaking, he sat in front of the table in silence. He stood up and walked around. In the end, he landed in front of the computer and said excitedly, “I remember now. My daughter was kidnapped. Then, someone forced me to transplant the bone marrow of the eldest daughter of the Lu family, Lu Nian, to another girl of similar age.”

When Qiao Nian heard Shen An’s words, she couldn’t help but clench her fists. So she had really donated her bone marrow to Song Man when she was three years old.

“I’ll just turn it off.” As Shen An spoke, his hand was about to touch the camera when he picked up a piece of paper under the camera. “By the way, I want to tell Yan’er about what happened twenty years ago.”

Qiao Nian’s sharp eyes saw the words written on the piece of paper. Shen An must have recalled what had happened back then through the reminder on the piece of paper.

“In the past, when you were by my side and I saw you in so much pain every day, I wanted to tell you the truth, but I didn’t dare. As a teacher, I did such a despicable thing.” As Shen An spoke, he sat in front of the camera and grabbed his hair with both hands. “They used my daughter’s life to force me to do a bone marrow transplant.”

Shen An’s hair was in a mess, and tears streamed down his face.

When Su Yan heard Shen An’s words, her body went limp and she almost fainted. Fortunately, Lu You grabbed her.

Su Yan leaned against Lu You. She had never expected her most respected and trusted teacher to do such a thing.
