950 Selfish

For some reason, Qiao Xin had a bad feeling about this. But now, she had no way out. She couldn’t just watch as her father suffered because of her.

Qiao Xin’s tears fell. When she cried, she looked like a weeping beauty.

But no one present admired the beautiful sight of Qiao Xin crying.

“Yes,” Qiao Xin said tearfully.

After receiving Qiao Xin’s accurate answer, Gu Zhou smiled and continued, “Sure!”

Gu Zhou threw the baseball bat in his hand between Qiao Xin and Qiao Shan and said lightly, “You just said that if you’re willing to bear the consequences alone, then I’ll let you off if you break one of your legs with the baseball bat!”

Qiao Xin was so shocked that her eyes were about to pop out of her head. “You’re asking me to harm myself!”

“Otherwise, whoever manages to snatch the baseball bat can break one of the other party’s legs. As long as one of you has a broken leg, I’ll let you off.”

“How can that be?” As Qiao Xin spoke, she obediently took the baseball bat.

Gu Zhou raised his eyebrows slightly and said with interest, “Since you’ve got the baseball bat, choose one of the two. Break your leg or your father’s.”

“No, I won’t choose any of them!” Qiao Xin gripped the baseball bat in her hand tightly. The reason why she was holding the baseball bat was because she didn’t want Qiao Shan to have the chance to smash her leg.

“I’ll give you a minute to choose now.” Gu Zhou took out his phone and began to count down. He saw Qiao Xin hugging the baseball bat and crying. “There’s still fifty seconds.”

Qiao Shan looked at Qiao Xin worriedly. He looked at Qiao Xin’s injured leg. If Qiao Xin’s leg was broken, Qiao Xin’s life would be ruined. She would no longer be able to walk in front of outsiders. She would have to sit in a wheelchair.

He was getting old. Why not him?

At the thought that he would never be able to walk again, Qiao Shan broke out in a cold sweat. He gave Qiao Xin a pleading look.

Perhaps as long as Qiao Xin begged Gu Zhou, his heart would soften.

However, Qiao Xin’s mind was filled with thoughts of her father losing a leg. If her father really couldn’t walk in the future, how much would he suffer?

No, she could not let her father lose his leg.

Qiao Xin had never thought of breaking her own leg.

“No, no, I can’t choose.” Holding the baseball bat, Qiao Xin looked at Gu Zhou in tears and begged pitifully, “Second Young Master, everything in the past was my fault. I beg you to let us go. I’ve really changed. I won’t hurt Sister again. Sister dotes on me so much…”

“So, you want to break your own legs?” Gu Zhou didn’t take Qiao Xin’s pleading words to heart at all.

“Sister will never let you break our legs. Second Young Master, Sister…”

“Shut up!” Gu Zhou’s eyes turned cold, and a trace of displeasure flashed in them. “She’s not a member of the Qiao family. Don’t call her Sister!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

With that, Gu Zhou glanced at the time on his phone. There were still twenty seconds. “If you can’t bear to break your legs, Chen Qing can help you!”

Qiao Xin hugged the bat in her hand and cried until she was out of breath. Her eyes were swollen.

“Three!” Gu Zhou looked at the time on his phone and counted down coldly.

Qiao Xin crawled to Gu Zhou’s side on her knees, but Gu Zhou kicked her away.

Gu Zhou counted down. “Two!”

Qiao Xin’s heart was about to jump out of her mouth. She turned to look at Qiao Shan, clenching the baseball bat in her hand.

Seeing Qiao Xin like this, Qiao Shan knew that Qiao Xin had chosen him. When he thought about how a girl like Qiao Xin might not be able to get married in the future if she lost her legs, he felt terrible. Just as he was about to ask Qiao Xin to choose him, he saw Qiao Xin raise the baseball bat in her hand.

“One!”

When Gu Zhou’s countdown ended, Qiao Xin closed her eyes and smashed the baseball bat at Qiao Shan’s leg.

Qiao Shan was stunned. He looked at Qiao Xin in disbelief.

Qiao Xin was his most precious daughter. Of course he was willing to give up everything for her.

But Qiao Xin really didn’t hesitate to raise the baseball bat and smash it against his leg.
