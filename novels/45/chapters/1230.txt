1231 I Made Things Difficult For You

“All these years, you’ve accompanied me and I made things difficult for you.”

Chang Feng had a smile in his eyes. When he thought of Qiao Nian, his lips curved up as well. He said softly, “She’s already grown up. No matter where she is, it’s a blessing for me to be able to protect my family.”

A trace of a smile flashed in Mr. Chen’s eyes.

Yes, protecting one’s family was also a happy thing.

At this moment, a child quickly ran over from afar, holding a small cage.

“Daddy!”

“Uncle Feng!”

This child looked to be about the same age as Gu Qi. His exquisite little face was filled with smiles. He ran happily to Mr. Chen and Chang Feng, holding a transparent glass ball with a little water.

When Chang Feng saw the child, he bent down and picked him up. “What did Xiao Bao do today?”

“I caught a little fish.” Xiao Bao picked up the small glass ball in his right hand, his young face filled with pride. “I caught it. Daddy said that I could raise it in the future.”

“Xiao Bao is really getting better and better now. You can even catch fish. Have you finished the homework the teacher assigned you?” Chang Feng looked at Xiao Bao with a smile and asked gently.

“I’ve finished my homework long ago. Uncle Chang Feng, I’m a good child. I’ll definitely finish his homework long ago. Not only that, I even took the initiative to ask Daddy to start an additional class for me today!” Xiao Bao puffed out his chest proudly, as if he was waiting for Chang Feng’s praise.

When Chang Feng heard Xiao Bao’s words, a trace of surprise flashed in his eyes. He glanced at Mr. Chen, who was sitting at the side. Seeing Mr. Chen nod, he asked curiously, “What is Xiao Bao preparing to learn?”

“To learn how to shoot, of course!” Xiao Bao made a pistol gesture with his hand. One of his eyes was slightly closed, making a bang. He said proudly, “This!”

Chang Feng was stunned. Xiao Bao was only five years old. How could he learn this?

What if it went off?

Chang Feng looked at Mr. Chen worriedly and asked, “Sir, is he too young to learn this now?” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Mr. Chen smiled. Just as he was about to speak, Xiao Bao immediately put on a cool expression and said, “I’m not young anymore. I wanted to learn how to shoot!”

“Children can just study hard now!”

Xiao Bao shook his head in disapproval and said seriously, “I have to learn how to shoot well. That way, I’ll have the ability to protect Mommy!”

Xiao Bao’s eyes lit up. “Really? Will Mommy be very happy?”

Xiao Bao would only be as innocent as a child when he mentioned his mommy.

Chang Feng smiled and nodded. “Of course. Your mommy will definitely like you very much!”

“I think Mommy will definitely like me very much too. She’ll definitely think I’m amazing!” When Xiao Bao said this, he couldn’t help but smile. He seemed to have thought of something and immediately pretended to be serious. “Uncle Feng, you should put me down. I’ll take you to see me shoot!”

Chang Feng looked at Xiao Bao and couldn’t help but smile. He immediately said, “Okay!”

Chang Feng placed Xiao Bao on the ground, and Xiao Bao immediately walked towards the gun training ground.

Chang Feng’s gaze landed on Mr. Chen’s face and he said softly, “Sir, I’ll go take a look!”

“Let’s go together!” Mr. Chen stood up and followed Chang Feng behind Xiao Bao.

At the gun training ground.

Xiao Bao held the pistol with both hands and aimed it at the bullseye. His young face was filled with seriousness.

Seeing Xiao Bao like this, Chang Feng’s lips curved up slightly. He still remembered that when he first carried Xiao Bao back, he was only a little child.

Unknowingly, Xiao Bao had already become a little man.

The silencer fired, and the glass bullet hit the target’s second ring!
