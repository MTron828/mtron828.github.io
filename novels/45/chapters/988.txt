989 Angry

When Chen Qing heard Lu Jiang’s words, he was slightly stunned. The Gu family and the Lu family were on good terms. In the past, Lu Jiang had always called him Brother Ah Zhou.

How did he suddenly become Second Young Master?

Moreover, Fourth Master didn’t look happy.

It seemed that Fourth Master had ill intentions this time!

Chen Qing said obediently, “Second Young Master is studying upstairs with Young Master and Young Miss.”

When Lu Jiang heard Chen Qing’s words, his expression instantly turned cold.

Gu Zhou actually had children?

The children could actually study.

It seemed that they were definitely not young anymore.

When he returned, he had heard that his sister and Gu Zhou had only been married for more than a year. It seemed that the two children were definitely not his sister’s.

Which wild woman had Gu Zhou impregnated?

At this moment, Lu Qi’s expression did not look good either. She did not expect Brother Ah Zhou to have children. The children could already study. Why was Sister still with Brother Ah Zhou?

Sister must have been raped by Brother Ah Zhou!

That’s right. That had to be it.

She could not let her sister be a stepmother to the two children at such a young age. He was definitely bullying her sister!

She could not let her sister be with Brother Ah Zhou. That sister had really suffered too much!

Chen Qing didn’t understand what he had said wrong.

He looked at the Lu siblings as if they were about to eat Second Young Master.

Chen Qing looked at Qiao Nian for help and asked carefully, “Young Madam, have you not told them about Little Master and Little Miss?”

“I didn’t remember this just now!” Qiao Nian said honestly.

Not only did Fourth Brother and his sister not know about this, but even Eldest Brother and Second Brother did not know.

Lu Jiang’s expression was so dark that water could drip from it. He had never expected the eldest daughter of the Lu family, whom he doted on so much, to be ruined like this. She even wanted to be someone’s stepmother, and the stepmother of two children! Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

No, he would never agree to this marriage!

Suppressing his anger, Lu Jiang’s voice grew colder and colder. He said firmly, “I haven’t seen Second Young Master in a long time. I can catch up with him today!”

Chen Qing said awkwardly, “Fourth Master and Miss Lu, this way please!”

Qiao Nian looked at the anger on Lu Jiang’s face. In a daze, she recalled the first time she had seen Lu Jiang at the bar.

At that time, Lu Jiang was gentle and refined, casually beating up those bad people.

Now that Lu Jiang knew that she was his sister, he was actually angry. Did he think that she had suffered in the Gu family?

Qiao Nian hurriedly followed.

Lu Qi had wanted to seek justice from Brother Ah Zhou, but when she saw that Fourth Brother was angry, she shrank back in fear and moved closer to Qiao Nian. “Sister, I haven’t seen Fourth Brother angry in a long time. Fourth Brother is very angry. He might even hit someone. If that’s the case later, remember to hold on to him. Brother Ah Zhou isn’t in good health!”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. Her heart warmed. It felt good to be protected and doted on by her family. “I don’t think Fourth Brother will fight Ah Zhou!”

“Sister, you don’t know this. Fourth Brother has the most irritable temper among the brothers. You have to know that when I was chased by a boy in the past, Fourth Brother directly beat him up for a week. Later on, whenever he saw that boy, he would beat him up!”

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Qi say that Fourth Brother had beaten him up for a week, she was stunned.

How persistent!

Qiao Nian recalled how the four of them had protected her in the hotel. When she came back to her senses, she had already walked into the living room.

Gu Zhou happened to walk down the stairs, one hand in his pocket. He seemed to be in a good mood. When he saw Qiao Nian, he automatically ignored Lu Jiang and Lu Qi. “Honey.”

Although Lu Jiang had been ignored, he was not angry at all. There was confusion in his eyes.

Gu Zhou looked at his sister gently and passionately, as if he cared a lot about her.

Moreover, Gu Zhou was definitely not the kind of person who would call his wife “honey” in front of outsiders just to put on an act. That could only mean one thing. Gu Zhou cared about her very much.

Qiao Nian stood rooted to the ground, her face flushed red. She hadn’t expected Gu Zhou to call her that.
