Chapter 1553 I've heard a lot about you

Gu Zhou's expression turned cold. He shielded Qiao Nian behind him.

At this moment, a group of people surrounded them. All of them were wearing black sportswear and black masks. Only their nostrils and eyes were exposed.

Their eyes were filled with killing intent as they stared coldly at Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian.

The crowd suddenly made way for a tall man. His gaze fell on Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

"So it's Second Young Master Gu and Young Madam clueless. I've heard a lot about you."

Although the man's voice was rough, it did not make one feel uncomfortable at all.

Qiao Nian's gaze fell on the man's eyes. She was very sure that she had never seen this man before, but he seemed to be very familiar with them.

How strange!

Gu Zhou glanced around indifferently. His aura was so powerful that everyone around him trembled. His gaze finally landed on the man pointing a gun at Qiao Nian.

When the man met Gu Zhou's gaze, his breathing hitched and his body trembled slightly. He felt as if he was being stared at by the Grim Reaper. His legs trembled, and he almost lost his grip on the gun.

When Cui Qi saw that his soldier's legs had gone weak from Gu Zhou's scare, he was stunned. Without hesitation, he shot that person in the heart.

The man's eyes were still open, as if he had died with remaining grievances. He fell to the ground following the inertia of the bullet.

Cui Qi looked at the coward and put away his gun indifferently. He said calmly, "Throw him away. Feed him to the wolves!"

It was better not to want such an embarrassing servant.

The others watched as Cui Qi killed someone. All of them were expressionless, as if they were already used to Cui Qi killing people.

Cui Qi's gaze fell on Gu Zhou's face. His lips curved up slightly with a devilish smile. "Second Young Master Gu, I wonder if you like this greeting gift?"

Gu Zhou looked up slightly and looked at Cui Qi calmly.

He seemed to be a natural-born king. Even though he did not have the advantage in numbers, the cold arrogance on his face was still not to be underestimated.

Gu Zhou's thin lips parted slightly, and his voice was as calm as ever, as if he was chatting calmly. "You're disguised very well. Are you afraid that I'll see you, General Cui Qi?"

When Qiao Nian heard the words "Cui Qi", a trace of surprise flashed in her eyes, but she quickly calmed down.

Before they came to Europe, they had already investigated the situation of the European royal family. Cui Qi was a great general of Europe, but he was Earl Mark's subordinate. All this time, he had been hiding in the dark and working for Mark.

Cui Qi was only slightly stunned. Seeing that Gu Zhou had recognized him, he pulled off the mask on his face and looked at Gu Zhou with a complicated expression.

Qiao Nian looked at Cui Qi's face and finally understood why Cui Qi had been hiding in the dark, unwilling to show his face.

Other than his mouth and eyes, most of the skin on Cui Qi's face was scarred, as if he had been disfigured by sulfuric acid. Under the light of the lightning, he looked like a ferocious demon that had crawled up from hell.

If it were someone timid, they would definitely be trembling in fear with this face.

However, Qiao Nian was very curious. Although Cui Qi was a general who was hiding in the dark, the president seemed to admire Cui Qi very much. He had even given Cui Qi the title of general.

It was said that Cui Qi had been a general of the European royal family for generations. Logically speaking, Cui Qi should also be a noble. Who exactly ruined Cui Qi's face?

The rain poured down, and the mottled shadows of the trees fell on Cui Qi's face. He looked at Qiao Nian sinisterly.

He saw that Qiao Nian was looking at him without changing her expression. There was no fear or uneasiness in her eyes.

His lips curved up, and his eyes were filled with laughter.

It would have been better if he hadn't laughed. When he did, his face was bunched up into a ball. He looked a little terrifying, like a demon.

Cui Qi's gaze fell on Gu Zhou's face. There was some admiration in his eyes as he said, "It's rumored that Second Young Master Gu rarely asks questions. Now, it seems that the rumors are too fake. Second Young Master Gu has just arrived in Europe, but he's already figured out my identity!"

Cui Qi noticed that Gu Zhou was holding Qiao Nian's hand. His eyes darkened, and the smile on his face instantly disappeared. He asked sinisterly, "It's a pity that today next year will be the anniversary of your death. The two of you will be company on the road to hell. I think you definitely won't be alone."
