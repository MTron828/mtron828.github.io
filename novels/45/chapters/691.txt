Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Qi in shock. She didn’t expect Gu Qi to be playing the same game as her.

However, she felt that it was a pity that she had always been second in the national server, far behind the first.

She was very curious about Gu Qi’s skills. Then, when she leaned over, she saw the crystal opposite her. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Victory!”

At this moment, Gu Qi also noticed Qiao Nian approaching. He hurriedly turned off his phone and looked at Qiao Nian uneasily, a little afraid.

At this moment, Gu Qi was like a child who had done something wrong. He was afraid of the accusations of the adults.

Qiao Nian smiled and sat down beside Gu Qi. Her gaze sized up Gu Qi’s face. His face was flushed red, and his lips were rosy. It was obvious that he had recovered from his illness.

Qiao Nian reached out and touched Gu Qi’s forehead, then her own. The temperature was about the same.

However, just in case, Qiao Nian moved slightly closer to Gu Qi and gently pressed her forehead against his.

Gu Qi’s black grape-colored eyes instantly widened, and his pupils involuntarily dilated. He stared blankly at Qiao Nian, his ears turning red.

Qiao Nian carefully felt the temperature of Gu Qi’s forehead and was relieved to find that he really no longer had a fever.

Qiao Nian smiled at Gu Qi. Thinking of how he had been playing games just now, she asked curiously, “Xiao Qi was playing Honor of Kings just now?”

Gu Qi recalled that Qiao Nian had already seen his phone, so he nodded. There was no point in lying now.

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Qi’s words, her eyes lit up. She asked with interest, “I didn’t expect you to know how to play this game too. Why don’t we play as a pair?”

Gu Qi shook his head stubbornly and said seriously, “I only like to hit myself!”

Qiao Nian hadn’t expected to be rejected.

Although she couldn’t beat the first place in the national server in the game, she was more than enough to deal with others.

Moreover, Gu Qi was young. His level in the game was definitely not high. She would definitely be able to carry him if he had a low level.

Qiao Nian moved closer to Gu Qi and smiled at him. Her beautiful fox-like eyes narrowed slightly as she coaxed, “Auntie is especially good at games. She can carry you.”

When Gu Qi heard Qiao Nian’s words, he glanced at her indifferently and shook his head. “There’s no need.”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Qi with interest. She didn’t expect Gu Qi to reject her suggestion.

One had to know that almost everyone who played King of Games wanted to be sent flying.

Could it be that Gu Qi didn’t know what to do?

If Gu Qi didn’t understand at all, the chances of him winning that round weren’t high.

Unless Gu Qi’s teammate was someone especially powerful.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian smiled at Gu Qi and said, “If I bring you along, I can bring you to the king level!”

At this moment, Qiao Nian looked like an old auntie coaxing a cute child.

Gu Qi’s gaze landed on Qiao Nian’s eyes. He sighed softly, then said solemnly, “Auntie Nian Nian, can you mature a little?”

Qiao Nian was speechless.

Gu Qi seemed to be saying that she was very childish.

But she wasn’t childish at all.

She was clearly an adult, but she just wanted to have a better relationship with Gu Qi.

Just as Qiao Nian was about to speak, she saw Gu Qi’s lips curl up slightly.

She chuckled and patted Gu Qi’s head, a bright smile appearing on her face. It seemed that Gu Qi had his own secrets in the game!

Gu Qi sat there quietly, letting Qiao Nian stroke his head. He was indescribably happy.

In the game, he often heard from others that adults did not allow children to play games. Moreover, his father did not like him to play games.

However, his Auntie Nian Nian wasn’t be like this. Auntie Nian Nian didn’t think that it was a bad thing for him to play games.

Moreover, Auntie Nian Nian seemed to think that he was very good at playing games. She even wanted to play games with him.

Actually, he also wanted to play games with Auntie Nian Nian.
