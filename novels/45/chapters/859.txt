Only those who worked often would have rough hands.

Xiao Shi’s hands were rough.

Later on, Gu Zhou also looked at the surveillance cameras. He had never expected that when he woke up in the morning at the age of five, not only did she have to wash up herself, but she also had to help Song Man carry water to wash up.

Song Man had lost one hand, but her other hand was still there.

Song Man could have worked on her own, but she let a five-year-old child do these things.

It was precisely because of this that Gu Zhou had initially wanted to compensate Song Man, but in the end, he gave up this thought.

A vicious woman like Song Man was not worthy of compensation at all.

When the results were out, he would be able to confirm if Song Man was the mother of the two children.

If Song Man was not the mother of the two children, how did she appear beside her ?

Or could it be that Song Man had done something manipulative from the beginning to the end?

Song Man knew what had happened that night five years ago. To be precise, it had been almost six years since that incident.

This proved that Song Man was related to that girl. As for their relationship, he could not be sure.

Chen Qing’s preliminary investigation found that Song Man and Xiao Shi had lived in Hai Cheng for five years.

It seemed that if he wanted to know who the biological mother of the two children was, he had to start with Song Man, because Song Man seemed to be an insider.

Qiao Nian stood beside Gu Zhou. She could sense that Gu Zhou hated Song Man.

To be honest, she didn’t like Song Man either.

How innocent and adorable was her child? Song Man was actually so vicious as to let her child do so much work.

Moreover, she had come here today to take Xiao Shi away.

She was worried that Song Man would lose control of her temper and abuse Xiao Shi again.

She did not want Xiao Shi to suffer any grievance.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian said, “I want to take a look at Xiao Shi.”

Qiao Nian was speaking to Gu Zhou.

Before Gu Zhou could speak, Song Man impatiently rejected Qiao Nian’s suggestion. “No, you can’t see her!”

A trace of confusion flashed across Qiao Nian’s face.

Song Man quickly reacted. She felt that her attitude was a little too unyielding. After some thought, she said, “Xiao Shi is my daughter. I’ll call her. You don’t have to!”

Qiao Nian looked at Song Man suspiciously and said, “Isn’t your reaction a little too big? I just wanted to take a look at Xiao Shi. Besides, it’s not up to me to decide if I’ll take Xiao Shi away. It should be up to Gu Zhou. Your reaction is so big. Could it be…”

Qiao Nian’s heart jumped to her throat. She narrowed her eyes and looked at Song Man suspiciously.

Her heart began to race, and the uneasiness in her heart gradually grew. Without waiting for Song Man to speak, she walked upstairs.

She walked very quickly and did not realize that she was very anxious.

Gu Zhou sensed that Song Man’s expression was not good. He glanced at her with a complicated expression and followed her.

Song Man frowned and jogged after him, her heart in a mess.

Qiao Nian walked to Xiao Shi’s room and knocked on the door. There was no movement inside. She knocked twice more, but there was no response.

Qiao Nian’s face was filled with anxiety. She couldn’t help but knock a few more times, but there was still no movement in the room.

How odd.

Even if Xiao Shi was asleep, she should have woken up when she heard her knock on the door.

Moreover, she had been taking care of Song Man for so many years. She usually did not sleep well. Now that there was movement, she should be able to get up.

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian felt her heart become empty.

Qiao Nian’s heart was in a mess. In the end, she kicked the door open.

The sound of the door being kicked open was very loud, but Xiao Shi, who had been sleeping on the bed, seemed to not hear it.

She slept quietly in the middle of the bed, like a sleeping beauty. However, her face was a little pale, and her lips were pale.

Song Man frowned slightly. She walked in first and sat by Xiao Shi’s bed. She looked at Qiao Nian with disdain and said angrily, “I already said that the child is taking an afternoon nap. How can you disturb her? She’s not your child. You don’t know how to feel sorry for her at all!”

At this moment, Song Man didn’t forget to complain about Qiao Nian. She stole a glance at Gu Zhou and saw that his expression was indifferent. He had no intention of paying her any attention.

She really didn’t understand what was so good about Qiao Nian. Why was Gu Zhou always on Qiao Nian’s side?
