Chapter 287: Old Fool?

Xia Xue’s heart was beating wildly. Fortunately, Brother Cao didn’t deny that she was the female musician. Otherwise, she would definitely be humiliated today.

Xia Xue turned to look at Qiao Nian, a trace of triumph appearing in her eyes.

So what if Qiao Nian was powerful?

As long as Brother Cao did not choose Qiao Nian, Qiao Nian would still not be Mr. Dong Hua’s female musician.

With this thought in mind, Xia Xue straightened her back. She was the female musician chosen by Brother Cao. This was an indelible fact.

And Qiao Nian was just someone who played the violin better than her. She wasn’t worth mentioning.

Wang Xuan, who was standing at the side, frowned slightly. Her gaze fell on Brother Cao, and she felt a little uncomfortable. She didn’t understand what was wrong with Brother Cao. Why did he give up on Qiao Nian, an outstanding female musician, and instead let an imposter like Xia Xue become a female musician?

Had Brother Cao gone senile?

Or could it be that Brother Cao couldn’t tell who could play better?

This was impossible. Brother Cao must have a certain level of appreciation.

Could it be that Brother Cao had taken a bribe from Xia Xue?

Wang Xuan’s gaze fell on Mr. Dong Hua, who was behind Brother Cao.

Mr. Dong Hua’s skin was already fair to begin with, so this made him look even more sinister. His phoenix-like eyes were slightly narrowed, and he looked displeased.

Didn’t Brother Cao realize that Mr. Dong Hua was angry? 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Actually, Qiao Nian hadn’t expected Brother Cao to answer like this either. However, she didn’t feel uncomfortable. Brother Cao might have his own thoughts.

It was her honor to be Mr. Dong Hua’s female musician. If Mr. Dong Hua was unwilling to invite her to be his female musician, that would be his choice.

This was a matter of mutual consent, not coercion.

However, Qiao Nian believed that Mr. Dong Hua would never let Xia Xue be his female musician again.

Seeing that Brother Cao had not changed his mind, the others lost all interest.

“Alright, let’s all go back. Xia Xue still has to practice. If she doesn’t pull it off well, she’ll blame us again!”

“I’m just feeling indignant for Mr. Dong Hua. Looks like Mr. Dongfang’s concert will definitely be ruined!”

“What kind of good music can a person who has even forgotten the score of a violin produce?”

“Is it because Xia Xue is good-looking?”

“No way. Xia Xue is far inferior to Qiao Nian.”

“Or perhaps Brother Cao has special taste?”

“Although I don’t have the tickets to Mr. Dong Hua’s concert, it seems that Mr. Dong Hua’s concert won’t end well. I just hope that Mr. Dong Hua will learn his lesson and never use Xia Xue again!”

…

When Brother Cao heard these words, he frowned.

What nonsense were these people spouting?

Brother Cao was worried about Mr. Dong Hua. If he still couldn’t find the person who played the violin that afternoon, he would probably disappoint his fans.

This Xia Xue was simply useless.

When he first saw Xia Xue, he had thought that she was not bad. Now, the more he looked at her, the more he felt that she was like a toad!

When Mr. Dong Hua found the person he was looking for, he would make Xia Xue scram as far away as possible.

Qiao Nian had also planned to leave. At this moment, Mr. Dong Hua spoke. “Miss Qiao, please wait.”

Xia Xue’s heart, which had been set at ease, instantly rose to her throat.

Gao Lin walked to the door and turned back, frowning in surprise.

How could a mere assistant be so rude as to stop Qiao Nian on such an occasion?

Qiao Nian stopped in her tracks and handed the violin to Wang Xuan, asking her to bring it back to the classroom.

Holding the violin, Wang Xuan walked to the door. Seeing that Gao Lin still wanted to eavesdrop, she smiled and called out, “Gao Lin, let’s go! Let’s go back together!”

Gao Lin’s expression froze. She glared at Wang Xuan angrily but remained silent.

When Wang Xuan passed by Gao Lin, she secretly placed a pen in Gao Lin’s pocket without anyone seeing.
