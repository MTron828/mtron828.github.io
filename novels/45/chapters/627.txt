Chapter 628: The Past

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian had a strange feeling.

Listening to the people around her mourning her non-stop while she had to embroider a blessing bag for her, this feeling was really subtle.

She really wanted to reunite with the Lu family.

But she also knew in her heart that now was not the time.

In order to find out who had framed her back then, she could only hide in the dark.

Qiao Nian looked at Matriarch Gu’s dejected expression and comforted her softly. “Grandma, you don’t have to worry too much. She’s so lucky. Perhaps she’s living a different life now and is living quite well.”

When Matriarch Gu heard Qiao Nian’s words, she nodded in agreement. She hoped that the eldest daughter of the Lu family would live a better life, so she didn’t sense the meaning behind Qiao Nian’s words.

Perhaps it was because she was getting old, but she couldn’t help but recall the past. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Matriarch Gu said, “Actually, that girl from the Lu family is quite fated with our family.”

When Qiao Nian heard Matriarch Gu’s words, her interest was piqued.

Gu Chuan had always called her Nian’er. Perhaps she had met Gu Chuan when she was still in the Lu family. At that time, Gu Chuan had already remembered her.

Hence, Qiao Nian was very curious about the past of the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

“Did she come to the Gu residence often when she was young?” Qiao Nian asked with a smile.

Just as Matriarch Gu was about to speak, she inadvertently caught sight of Qiao Nian’s curious eyes. Her expression faltered slightly, and she slapped her leg regretfully. “Oh my, I shouldn’t have told you about this. I accidentally let it slip!”

Qiao Nian looked at Matriarch Gu in confusion, her curiosity piqued. “Why?”

Matriarch Gu sighed sadly. She felt that Qiao Nian was a sensible child. She probably wouldn’t argue with a dead child.

At the thought of this, she said, “Actually, this matter has something to do with Ah Zhou. I have to start from when he was young.”

Qiao Nian nodded and didn’t speak. She listened quietly to Matriarch Gu’s recount of the past.

Matriarch Gu looked up into the distance. Her eyes gradually turned blank, as if she was lost in her memories.

Initially, Old Master Gu and Old Master Lu were both vying for the first seat in An City.

Even biological brothers would not be willing to be ranked first, let alone two unrelated families.

However, Old Master Lu thought the same.

Due to this, the Gu family and the Lu family began a five-year trade war.

At that time, An City was developing rapidly.

The Gu family and the Lu family were both constantly expanding their territories.

Suddenly, someone from the higher-ups came to An City, saying that they were looking for people who had died in the war many years ago. They were looking forward to the return of the ashes of the martyrs and burying them in the cemetery.

Back then, the war lasted for eight years. During those eight years, countless martyrs died heroically. The ashes of many martyrs were still buried at the border.

At that time, it wasn’t easy for the higher-ups to investigate those martyrs, so they thought of getting the veterans who had participated in the war to pick them up.

Old Master Gu had participated in wars in the past, so he signed up to claim the ashes of his former class monitor.

Coincidentally, Old Master Lu was also going to retrieve the ashes of the former class monitor. The two of them bumped into each other.

The two of them happened to be sitting together and chatting calmly. In the end, they realized that they had both once saved each other’s lives.

Hence, they put down their prejudices against each other and shook hands again.

This resulted in the current situation in An City.

In order to build a good relationship between the two families, they had decided to marry their children.

The marriage partners were Gu Zhou and the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

When Qiao Nian heard the first part, she was so touched that she was about to cry.

Not only was she deeply touched by her biological grandfather and Old Master Gu’s feats in the army, but she was also touched by that difficult history.

However, just as she was feeling touched, Matriarch Gu’s next words instantly made all her emotions dissipate.

Matriarch Gu smiled and said, “At that time, Ah Zhou had already been born, but the eldest daughter of the Lu family had yet to be born. We didn’t know if it was a boy or a girl. Everyone thought that if it was a girl, they would become in-laws. If it was a boy, they would become brothers.”
