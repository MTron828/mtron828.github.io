788 Because of Him

Qiao Nian smiled at Gu Zhou and said calmly, “I did marry into the family because of him.”

Gu Zhou’s dark eyes darkened, like the dark night sky without any light, bringing endless fear.

Qiao Nian could clearly feel Gu Zhou’s body stiffen. Gu Zhou was exuding a cold aura, and it was getting colder and colder, as if he wanted to freeze her.

Noticing that Gu Zhou was angry, she hurriedly explained, “I didn’t contact him until four years ago. Then, someone gave me a letter. When I opened it and saw the token inside, I realized that it was a letter from Eldest Senior Brother.”

“Eldest Senior Brother wanted me to help you treat your illness.” As Qiao Nian spoke, she gently tugged at Gu Zhou’s sleeve. “He’s my Eldest Senior Brother. Naturally, I’m willing to help him. However, there are many people around you who are protecting you. I can’t approach you rashly, lest you mistake me for someone with ulterior motives. If you’re unwilling to let me treat your illness, I won’t be able to fulfill Eldest Senior Brother’s request.”

Gu Zhou’s expression softened a lot, and the temperature in the air gradually rose.

“A year ago, the Qiao family came to me and asked me to marry you on behalf of Qiao Xin. I thought that if I became your wife, you would be willing to let me treat your illness, so I agreed.” Qiao Nian smiled at Gu Zhou and continued, “I haven’t contacted Eldest Senior Brother since. Don’t think too much!”

Gu Zhou lowered his gaze, staring unblinkingly at Qiao Nian. His long eyelashes reflected a row of faint silhouettes.

His dark eyes gradually lit up. He was a little surprised, but also very happy.

Gu Zhou’s thin lips parted slightly. “Really?”

“Of course it’s true. What else could it be?” Qiao Nian reached out and held Gu Zhou’s hand. She tilted her head slightly and asked innocently, “Do you think there’s something else?”

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian with a burning gaze, as if he wanted to see her heart through her eyes.

Gu Zhou’s gaze was too hot for Qiao Nian to handle. She swallowed and looked away uncomfortably, wanting to take the opportunity to leave. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

However, Gu Zhou was still holding her waist.

Qiao Nian let go of Gu Zhou’s other hand and tried to push his hand away from her waist, but Gu Zhou’s grip was too strong.

“Um, I have something else to do. I want to go…”

Before Qiao Nian could finish speaking, she heard Gu Zhou’s low voice coming from above her head. “Shouldn’t you be sleeping?”

“I’m not sleeping. I’m not sleepy at all!”

As soon as Qiao Nian finished speaking, she felt Gu Zhou tighten his grip on her waist.

“There’s no end to your work. You should sleep during bedtime!”

With that, Gu Zhou grabbed Qiao Nian’s hand without hesitation and pulled her towards the bed.

Qiao Nian wanted to retract her hand, but Gu Zhou’s grip was too strong. She couldn’t do so at all.

Recalling Gu Zhou’s gaze just now, Qiao Nian’s ears turned red uncontrollably. Before she could react, she was pressed against the bed by Gu Zhou.

The two of them faced each other. She could clearly hear Gu Zhou’s heart beating again and again. It was so clear.

Her heart began to race involuntarily, too. Both of them were racing, far faster than their usual heartbeats.

Qiao Nian’s mind went blank for a moment. She couldn’t help but ask, “Gu Zhou, what do you like about me?”

“I just like you for who you are!”

Qiao Nian was a little stunned by his words. She didn’t understand what he meant at all.

What kind of answer was that?

For some reason, Qiao Nian recalled that night five years ago. What happened that night was her nightmare, a nightmare that she couldn’t get rid of.

Even after so long, she still couldn’t get over it.

The confusion in Qiao Nian’s eyes gradually dissipated, replaced by a trace of pain. She said softly, “Gu Zhou, actually, if you really knew everything about me, you might not like me anymore!”

Because I’m not worth liking!

Sadness welled up in Qiao Nian’s heart.
