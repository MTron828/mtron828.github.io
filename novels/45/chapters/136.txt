Chapter 137 Kneel and Apologize

Su Xue swallowed and continued, “Nian Nian has been stubborn ever since she was a child. I just wanted her to take good care of you. I wanted her to place her focus on taking care of you, not on her work. That made her angry.”

Qiao Shan had initially wanted to use this opportunity to cut ties with Qiao Nian, but when he heard Su Xue mention work, he realized that Qiao Nian might possess things that were worth even more than Suranne Grass and Moonlight Grass.

For the sake of money, Qiao Shan felt that he could give up his dignity.

Suppressing the pain, Qiao Shan gave a tragic smile. “Son-in-law, you’ve really misunderstood me. How could we bear to bully her?”

Looking at Qiao Shan and Su Xue’s pretentious faces, Qiao Nian felt a wave of disgust.

Gu Zhou did not speak.

When Qiao Shan and Su Xue’s faces had already grown stiff from smiling, Gu Zhou turned to look at Chen Qing. “Chen Qing, you tell me.”

Chen Qing’s eyes lit up. It was finally his turn.

Chen Qing stepped forward and cleared his throat. In a vivid manner, he repeated the awful words Su Xue had said to Qiao Nian on the phone. He also acted out in detail the scene of Qiao Shan and Qiao Xin bullying Qiao Nian the moment she had returned to the Qiao family’s residence.

Chen Qing felt that his acting skills were off the charts. If he became an actor, he might even receive an Oscar.

Nearing the end, Chen Qing began to add his own embellishments. “I won’t repeat the other insults they threw at Madam. After that, Qiao Shan even got the servants to surround Madam. He said that he wanted to break Madam’s legs, pull out her tendons, and skin her alive. He insisted on beating Madam to death. If it weren’t for the fact that Madam still had a little ability to protect herself, I’m afraid Madam would have been tortured to the point where only a pile of bones would remain!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Shan: I don’t remember being that fierce??

Su Xue’s face turned red with anger. “You’re spouting nonsense!”

Qiao Xin said weakly, “Brother Chen Qing! You can’t embellish the story!”

Chen Qing straightened his back, raising an eyebrow. “Even if I am embellishing, there must have been something to add embellishments to in the first place. Besides, I’m just stating the facts. At most, I’m repeating what you all thought deep down.”

Gu Zhou radiated off a cold aura, causing the people around him to shiver in fear.

“Who among these people insulted Madam?”

Chen Qing’s gaze swept over everyone. Without hesitation, he said loudly, “All of them!”

Gu Zhou’s eyes turned cold. “In that case, all of you kneel down and apologize to my wife!”

Qiao Shan froze. What?

Asking him to kneel down and apologize to Qiao Nian?

How was this possible?

His head could be chopped off. His blood could flow. But no matter what, his knees could not touch the ground!

Gu Zhou smiled at Qiao Shan and raised his voice. “Why? Are you unwilling?”

A trace of panic flashed across Su Xue’s face. Her body swayed on the spot. If a servant hadn’t been supporting her, she might have collapsed.

Su Xue said hesitantly, “How… How can you say that? No parent would kneel down and apologize to their daughter…” “Your daughter?” Gu Zhou’s expression darkened. “She’s now officially my wife!”

Gu Zhou’s tone was so forceful that even Qiao Nian was stunned.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou’s tall and broad figure. For a moment, she couldn’t tell if Gu Zhou was doing this for her or for the sake of the Gu family’s dignity.

Qiao Xin gritted her teeth.

When she left the research facility today, Brother Su Yan was already giving her the cold shoulder. He had left her on the road, driving off without a backward glance.

At that time, she was heartbroken.

But how was this fair?

How could Qiao Nian be shielded by such a good man like Gu Zhou while her boyfriend Su Yan found her embarrassing to be with?

She was clearly more outstanding than Qiao Nian. Why wasn’t anyone protecting her today? “I’ll make this clear today. Qiao Nian is my wife. No matter how big of a mess she has gotten into, I’ll bear the consequences. If any of you dare to say a single word of abuse to her, or even lay a finger on her, don’t blame me for being impolite!”

With that, Gu Zhou turned to look at Chen Qing. “Everyone who insulted Madam. Hit them!”

Gu Zhou’s tone was arrogant and overbearing, frightening everyone present.
