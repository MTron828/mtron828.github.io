923 How Dare You Hit Me

Qiao Nian’s mind was in a mess. She didn’t know what had gone wrong.

Qiao Xin raised her eyebrows slightly. Seeing Qiao Nian’s pained expression, she said smugly, “You’re the jinx. That’s why your child…”

Bam!

The crisp sound of the slap resounded throughout the private room.

Qiao Xin was stunned. She covered her face with her hand and looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief. Her eyes turned cold. “How dare you hit me?”

Bam!

Qiao Nian mercilessly slapped Qiao Xin again.

Two distinct palm prints appeared on Qiao Xin’s face, one on each side. Her face was burning with pain, and her ears buzzed like flies.

During this period of time, Qiao Xin had been behaving herself and hadn’t faced Qiao Nian head-on. After being slapped twice by Qiao Nian, she finally remembered that Qiao Nian had never shown her any mercy in the past.

Qiao Xin looked at Qiao Nian in fear and unease. She swallowed nervously, thinking about how to leave this place.

To deal with someone like Qiao Nian, one had to secretly trip her. After all, she was a lady and wouldn’t hit anyone.

Qiao Nian’s fox-like eyes gradually turned red, and her expression darkened. She enunciated each word clearly. “Qiao Xin, killing you is as easy as stepping on an ant. You’d better behave yourself and tell me everything that happened back then!”

Qiao Xin was so angry that her eyes turned red. Who did Qiao Nian think she was? She was just a wild girl from the countryside. She was nothing.

She didn’t expect Song Man to still have to deal with Qiao Nian even though she was the Young Miss of the Lu family. If she embarrassed Qiao Nian now, Song Man would have to be grateful to her.

It was also good for the Qiao family that she was on good terms with Song Man.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Xin raised her hand to hit Qiao Nian.

However, she was no match for Qiao Nian in the end. Qiao Nian grabbed her wrist.

Qiao Nian was so strong that her wrist hurt.

Qiao Xin frowned. She wanted to retract her hand, but Qiao Nian’s grip was too tight. She couldn’t move her hand at all.

“Let go of me!” Qiao Xin frowned at Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian’s eyes turned cold. She flung Qiao Xin aside forcefully.

Qiao Xin staggered twice, lost her balance, and fell to the ground. It was so painful her tears were about to fall.

She sat on the ground and looked at Qiao Nian with hatred written all over her face.

Qiao Nian walked up to Qiao Xin in her high heels and looked down at her. At this moment, Qiao Xin looked extremely disheveled.

Qiao Nian’s eyes gradually filled with killing intent. Qiao Xin had hurt her again and again.

However, she could also sense that Qiao Xin was telling the truth about her childbirth.

If Qiao Xin wasn’t lying, the Qiao family definitely didn’t know about the child swap. It seemed that she wouldn’t be able to get any other useful information from the Qiao family.

Qiao Xin was so frightened that her face turned pale. She shook her head in panic and said anxiously, “I’ve already told you everything I know. What else do you want to know?”

Qiao Nian didn’t speak. Her beautiful eyes narrowed slightly as she scrutinized Qiao Xin.

Many things must have happened on the night she gave birth. According to Qiao Xin, she had given birth prematurely. She would definitely pay special attention to her health. How could she have given birth prematurely?

Could it be that her child’s premature birth was not an accident?

At that time, there must have been someone behind the scenes involved. Otherwise, Xiao Shi wouldn’t have been by Song Man’s side.

Was Qiao Xin really innocent?

Qiao Nian wasn’t sure.

Qiao Xin stood up shakily. She took a deep breath and pretended to be calm. “Qiao Nian, I’ve told you everything I know. I won’t let you off!”

Qiao Nian looked at Qiao Xin in confusion.

Qiao Xin gritted her teeth and looked at Qiao Nian. She took out her phone and called Song Man.

Once she called Song Man over, she wanted to see how long Qiao Nian could continue acting. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, her phone rang.

Qiao Nian looked at Qiao Xin expressionlessly and took out Song Man’s phone from her bag. Under Qiao Xin’s surprised gaze, she slowly picked up the call.

“Hello?”

When Qiao Xin heard Qiao Nian’s voice coming from the phone, she was stunned. She looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief.
