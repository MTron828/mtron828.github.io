1039 On What Basis?

Why was Qiao Nian the eldest daughter of the Lu family?

On what basis?

She was so good. Why wasn’t she the eldest daughter of the Lu family?

Qiao Xin bit her lip. If she were the eldest daughter of the Lu family, she would definitely be more outstanding than Qiao Nian. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Qiao Xin recalled the Lu Zhu she had seen. Lu Zhu and Gu Zhou were the most highly ranked men in An City. He was the dream lover of thousands of girls.

Lu Zhu was Qiao Nian’s biological brother.

Gu Zhou was now Qiao Nian’s husband.

Why did all good men belong to Qiao Nian!

The more Qiao Xin thought about it, the angrier she became. She still remembered the way Lu Zhu looked at Qiao Nian. His eyes were filled with love and doting.

The jealousy in Qiao Xin’s eyes burned.

She would never let Qiao Nian have an easy time.

Qiao Xin looked at He Cheng, who was beside her. The only person who could help her now was He Cheng.

Qiao Xin said to He Cheng, “Don’t you think Lu Zhu’s attitude towards Qiao Nian is a little strange?”

“Really?” He Cheng waited for the elevator to open.

“Lu Zhu has nothing to do with Qiao Nian. Don’t you think it’s strange that Lu Zhu wants to help Qiao Nian catch us? I think Qiao Nian must have used her body in exchange for Lu Zhu’s help.” Qiao Xin paused for a moment and continued, “Six years ago, she also climbed into an old man’s bed shamelessly!”

The coldness in Qiao Xin’s eyes grew more and more obvious. She said, “I think there might not be enough men in our temple. We should find more beggars. Only then can Qiao Nian be satisfied.”

At the thought of Qiao Nian being tainted by those filthy men, Qiao Xin couldn’t help but smile.

When He Cheng heard Qiao Xin’s words, he was slightly stunned. Only then did he say, “I’ve already found twenty people.”

“How is twenty enough? No matter what, I want ninety-nine!” Qiao Xin’s eyes were filled with hatred for Qiao Nian.

He Cheng glanced at Qiao Xin with a complicated expression. This woman was too jealous!

Qiao Nian and Lu Zhu were siblings. It was normal for a brother to dote on his sister, but in Qiao Xin’s words, it had become a dirty transaction.

However, He Cheng couldn’t refute Qiao Xin directly. After all, Qiao Xin was his boss. He believed that if he didn’t do what Lu Jiang had said, he would be the one to die.

Seeing that He Cheng seemed to agree with her, Qiao Xin was satisfied.

Qiao Nian was a b*tch. He hoped that Qiao Nian could enjoy the men in that temple as soon as possible.

At this moment, the elevator opened with a ding-dong.

Only then did He Cheng and Qiao Xin enter the elevator.

He Cheng looked at the “-6” on the button and was slightly stunned. He said in a low voice, “So we’re on basement six now.”

Qiao Xin frowned and said in confusion, “How is that possible? Isn’t there a window in our room?”

“That’s not a window. It’s a kind of light that can simulate sunlight from the outside world.” When He Cheng said this, he was so frightened that he broke out in a cold sweat.

Previously, when he was in his room, he had wanted to break the glass to get out, but the glass was too hard and he had never broken it. Later on, he could only give up on the idea of breaking the glass.

He Cheng was a little glad that the Lu family had given him two choices. If the Lu family kept him and Qiao Xin locked up here, it wouldn’t be long before the two of them starved to death, and no one would find out.

The two of them did not speak. When the elevator door opened, the two of them could see a door from afar. They quickly walked towards it.

When the two of them walked out of the door, the rockery merged again, as if it had never been opened.

Qiao Xin gasped and said, “He Cheng, are we saved?”

“I think so,” He Cheng said guiltily.

After the two of them came out, He Cheng brought Qiao Xin out of Lu Zhu’s villa.

The two of them hadn’t walked far when they noticed a van parked at the side. He Cheng’s eyes lit up and he said, “I see my car. Let’s go. I’ll drive you home.”

“I…” Before Qiao Xin could finish her sentence, her stomach growled inappropriately.

He Cheng glanced at Qiao Xin and said, “Let’s go. I’ll take you out for dinner.”

When Qiao Xin and He Cheng were kidnapped, neither of their phones were taken away. He Cheng opened the car door and gestured for them to leave.
