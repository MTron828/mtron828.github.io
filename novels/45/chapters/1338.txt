1339 I Love You

When Bai Hui heard Xiao Shi’s words, her heart instantly softened. Her eyes sparkled with tears as she agreed softly. “Okay.”

She really didn’t want Xiao Shi and Gu Qi to leave her.

She had thought that she would insist on keeping the children, just like before.

But now, her heart softened. She wanted to see the joy in Gu Qi’s eyes and the bright light in Xiao Shi’s eyes. She didn’t want the two children to be sad.

Xiao Shi happily made a heart gesture at Bai Hui. “Goodbye, Grandma. I love you!”

Bai Hui’s heart, which had been frozen, began to race. She took a step forward and wanted to open her mouth, but she didn’t know what to say.

This was the first time she had felt at a loss for words.

Qiao Nian held Xiao Shi’s hand with her left and Gu Qi’s with her right.

Gu Qi had been following Gu Zhou. He had heard of Grandma’s deeds before, but he didn’t say anything. Holding Qiao Nian’s hand, he walked out.

Qiao Nian followed the children out. She turned back to look at Bai Hui and nodded politely.

Without even looking at Bai Hui, Lu Zhu followed Qiao Nian closely.

When Qiao Nian passed by Yu Chu, she heard Yu Chu call her “Second Sister-in-law”. She looked at Yu Chu. When her gaze fell on the palm print on Yu Chu’s face, her expression faltered slightly. After some thought, she smiled at Yu Chu and nodded.

Yu Chu gave a sweet smile.

Bai Hui’s mind was still filled with Xiao Shi’s heart gesture. Xiao Shi’s soft voice still rang in her ears.

When Bai Hui came back to her senses, Qiao Nian and the others had already gotten into the car.

Bai Hui quickly walked towards the door. When she reached the door, she stared unblinkingly in the direction the car had left in, unable to come back to her senses for a long time.

Yu Chu looked at Bai Hui’s lonely figure. At this moment, she felt that her teacher seemed to have aged.

She walked over to Bai Hui and said in a low voice, “Teacher, it’s time for class.”

Only then did Bai Hui notice that she had lost her composure. She pursed her lips and pretended to be calm. “Yes.”

She turned around and saw the clear palm print on Yu Chu’s face. She recalled how she had slapped Yu Chu’s face just now and frowned. Her eyes couldn’t hide her heartache. “Did I hurt you?”

Yu Chu gave a gentle smile and shook her head. “It doesn’t hurt.”

Bai Hui recalled how Yu Chu had looked when she was young. This child had been by her side since she was young. She still remembered Yu Chu telling her with teary eyes that she couldn’t study.

Yu Chu had always been a timid and shy girl. Even if she hurt her, Yu Chu would not say anything.

Bai Hui lowered her gaze slightly and reached out to hug Yu Chu. She said guiltily, “I’m sorry, there won’t be a next time.”

“Teacher.” Yu Chu’s lips curved into a gentle smile. She said gently, “It really doesn’t hurt. I don’t blame you.”

She had never understood why her teacher was so cold and mean to her family.

When Bai Hui heard Yu Chu’s words, her body paused for a moment. She let go of Yu Chu and gently stroked her face with her slender and fair hand. She said in a low voice, “Go and apply some medicine now. That way, you’ll recover faster.”

“Yes,” Yu Chu replied. She turned around and walked into the living room. After taking two steps, she seemed to have thought of something and turned to look at Bai Hui, who was walking towards the classroom. She asked softly, “Teacher, I still remember what you said when you brought me out of the mountains.”

Bai Hui’s eyes darkened. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Teacher, you said before that one shouldn’t always live in the past. No matter if the past is good or bad, one should be a warm person from the next moment.” Yu Chu pursed her lips and mustered her courage to say, “Teacher, do you want to reconcile with Brother Ah Zhou?”

The gentleness in Bai Hui’s eyes instantly disappeared. Her expression darkened as she said coldly, “My business has nothing to do with you.”

Bai Hui clenched her fists tightly and walked towards the classroom in her high heels.

Yu Chu looked at Bai Hui in disappointment and sighed helplessly.

Why was her teacher angry every time she said this?

She could vaguely sense her teacher’s dissatisfaction with the Gu family. Sometimes, her teacher would vent her anger on Brother Ah Yue and Brother Ah Zhou.

What exactly had happened to Teacher back then? Why had she become like this?

Yu Chu sighed helplessly. She really wanted to help her teacher untie the knot in her heart, but her teacher was stubbornly unwilling to let her get close.
