Chapter 161 Prize

Qiao Xin’s face was pale. She glared at Qiao Nian, hatred written all over her face.

Previously at the research institute, Qiao Nian had used Suranne Grass to humiliate and slander her.

Qiao Xin took a deep breath. As she listened to the skeptical remarks of the people around her, it occurred to her that they were all clowns, every one of them. They were just like her at the research institute during that humiliating incident.

A trace of shame flashed in Qiao Xin’s eyes. It was only now that she realized how stupid and foolish she had been back then.

At this moment, Lin Tao walked into the hall with a pot of Suranne Grass in her arms and placed it on Qiao Nian’s podium.

This pot of Suranne Grass instantly attracted everyone’s attention. It was like an invisible slap to the face of everyone who had been doubting Qiao Nian.

The entire hall was now in an uproar.

Everyone looked at the Suranne Grass in disbelief. Some people took off their glasses and rubbed their eyes hard. When they took a closer look, they realized that it was indeed Suranne Grass.

Some people even took photos of the plant to examine it more closely. Upon checking up on the Internet, they discovered that the plant was indeed Suranne Grass.

Although they all felt as if they had been slapped in the face, they were still very excited.

“Oh my god, it’s really Suranne Grass!” “How can Qiao Nian own such an expensive

plant?”

“Suranne Grass is priceless. Yet she dares to give this away as a prize!”

“Alright, stop talking. Hurry up and think of the answer!”

“That’s right, that’s right. I want to be the first to solve this riddle!”

Seeing the reactions of the people around her, Qiao Xin’s breathing grew more and more rapid. When she thought of the humiliation she had suffered in the research institute, she yearned to walk right up to Qiao Nian and fling a couple slaps at her face.

Qiao Xin’s eyes grew redder and redder. Although Brother Su Yan had been angry with her, he still genuinely liked her. He had spent a lot of money to cover up the whole embarrassing incident that had taken place at the research institute. Otherwise, her reputation would have been ruined, and she wouldn’t be able to attend such events now.

Qiao Yu sensed that something was wrong with Qiao Xin. He turned to look at her and gently patted her arm, consoling her gently. “Xinxin, don’t worry. With Brother around, you’ll be fine.”

When Qiao Xin heard Qiao Yu’s words, she looked up at him and nodded lightly.

At this moment, Qiao Yu’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian seemed to have changed a lot. She had become even more confident and eye-catching. Even standing on stage, and with no one in the audience responding to her question, she could still remain calm and composed.

Qiao Yu’s thin lips curved into an odd half-smile, his eyes glittering with satisfaction.

His little girl had truly grown up.

Qiao Yu lowered his gaze and turned to look at Qiao Xin, asking gently, “Do you really want the Suranne Grass?”

When Qiao Xin heard Qiao Yu’s question, her eyes lit up.

Qiao Xin was very arrogant, but she had to admit that Qiao Nian was indeed more outstanding than her. Moreover, Qiao Nian had the ability to cultivate Suranne Grass and Moonlight Grass.

If she could get her hands on this pot of Suranne Grass, she would gift it to Brother Su Yan once again. When that happened, Brother Su Yan would definitely treat her better.

She had to hold on to Brother Su Yan tightly. To her, Su Yan was the best springboard available. She was determined to lead a better life than Qiao Nian in the future.

After thinking everything through, Qiao Xin looked up at Qiao Yu and said firmly, “Brother, I want it.”

Hearing Qiao Xin’s words, Qiao Yu smiled dotingly and said in a gentle voice, “Okay, then I’ll win it back for you!”

Qiao Yu lowered his gaze. After some thought, he looked up at Qiao Nian, who was standing at the podium. “Is the answer related to his wife?” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Qiao Yu was the first to answer the question. Everyone’s gaze fell on Qiao Yu’s face.

“Is Qiao Yu trying to help his sister by getting the ball rolling?”

“Don’t tell me Qiao Nian told Qiao Yu the answer long ago. If Qiao Yu answers the riddle Qiao Nian gives, then this pot of Suranne Grass will still belong to the Qiao family.”

“I don’t think so!”

“If that’s really the case, then the Qiao family is really too despicable!”
