1357 Chinese Wedding?

Gu Zhou sat in the car and listened to Matriarch Gu’s words. His expression turned serious.

He recalled what Qiao Nian had said that night and said, “Nian’er likes Chinese weddings.”

“Chinese wedding?”

“Yes, I want to hold the wedding on October 1st.” Gu Zhou had long thought of a time. This was a celebratory day for the entire country. He and Qiao Nian could get married them.

“Aren’t you going to wear Han Chinese clothes?”

Matriarch Gu’s hesitant voice came through the cell phone.

Gu Zhou said, “Yes, I plan to set the venue at my hotel. I’ve already arranged for someone to design it. When the design is out, I’ll get someone to renovate it. I’m looking for a designer to design the Hanfu. As for the designer…”

“I’ll design Nian Nian’s Han clothes and the clothes she needs to wear when she gets married. You just have to find a designer to design your clothes.”

Matriarch Gu interrupted Gu Zhou.

When Gu Zhou heard Matriarch Gu’s words, he frowned. Was he still her biological grandmother?

Just as Gu Zhou was about to speak, he heard Matriarch Gu say, “Forget it. I’ll make the clothes for the two of you. After all, we have to make a couple’s design. It won’t be good if the design is too off.”

Gu Zhou’s frown deepened. Why did he feel that Grandma’s words were like saying “buy one, get one free”? He was the one who would get the free one.

Just as he was about to say something, Matriarch Gu’s voice came through the cell phone again.

“Alright, I’ll get back to work!”

Matriarch Gu hung up on Gu Zhou just like that.

Gu Zhou looked at the phone, which had already hung up. He silently put away his cell phone.

At the Gu family villa.

Qiao Nian coaxed the three children to sleep. She lay on the bed, her mind filled with what had happened recently.

First, she realized that the kidnapping twenty years ago was not simple. Later on, Jiang Chi’s death meant that the kidnapper knew the Lu family. Later on, she and Gu Zhou realized that Gu Yue and Eldest Senior Brother were still alive. Eldest Senior Brother even said that the HH Corporation wanted to deal with the Lu and Gu families. After returning to An City, Eldest Senior Brother even said that the kidnapping was related to the Europeans.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips slightly. Why was this matter so complicated?

She opened the drawer and was about to take a calming pill she had made when she saw a photo album below.

The photo album looked a little old. It must have been placed there for a long time.

She took out the photo album and opened it curiously.

The first page was a wedding photo

The woman in the photo was wearing a pure white wedding dress. The wedding dress in front of her chest was also covered in many small diamonds. Her hand was holding a diamond the size of a pigeon.

Her long hair was tied up, and the veil on her head was fixed with a white jade hairpin. Her skin was so fair that it was transparent. When she smiled, it was as if everything paled in comparison.

She could tell at a glance that this person was the young Bai Hui.

At this moment, Bai Hui was smiling. Her body was leaning towards the man beside her, and she was exuding happiness.

Qiao Nian looked at Bai Hui’s face and recalled the Bai Hui she had seen some time ago. Bai Hui seemed to have become a different person. She had gone from being cute and gentle to being cold and indifferent.

The man standing beside Bai Hui should be Gu Yue and Gu Zhou’s father, Gu Ting.

Gu Ting sat there expressionlessly, seemingly very cold.

Qiao Nian frowned slightly. Why did she feel that Gu Ting didn’t like Bai Hui at all?

From this photo, Bai Hui seemed to like Gu Ting a lot.

Although the two of them were a match made in heaven, their gazes spoke volumes about their hearts.

Bai Hui smiled happily, as if she was looking forward to her married life.

In the photo, Gu Ting seemed to be silent, not caring who was standing beside him at all.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips slightly, her eyes filled with confusion.

She didn’t know about Gu Ting and Bai Hui’s past, but she knew that if she had taken a wedding photo with Gu Zhou, Gu Zhou would definitely not be like this.

Qiao Nian moved her gaze away from the photo and looked at the next one.

There were two children in the photo. The two boys seemed to have been copied and pasted. They were too similar. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

However, one of the two boys was tall, and the other was short. From their heights, she could still distinguish Gu Zhou and Gu Yue.

The taller one was Gu Yue, and the shorter one was Gu Zhou. After all, Gu Yue was several years older than Gu Zhou!

Gu Qi and Xiao Shi were simply carved from the same mold, but there were still many differences between Xiao Bao and them.

Xiao Bao looked very similar to Gu Zhou in the photo. His small face was very exquisite.

However, Gu Qi’s expression was more like Gu Zhou’s. He looked childish and arrogant.

Oh my god, she really wanted to pinch Gu Zhou’s face.
