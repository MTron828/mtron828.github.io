Chapter 295: Taking the Initiative

Qiao Nian looked up at him. For some reason, she felt that Gu Zhou’s gaze was a little intriguing.

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned, but she still said honestly, “The first bite was quite spicy, but after that, only the fragrance remained.”

With that, Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on the transparent box in Gu Zhou’s hand. Her beautiful fox-like eyes darted around, then she smiled and suggested, “Why don’t you try it yourself?”

Qiao Nian felt that after she finished speaking, Gu Zhou’s gaze on her grew deeper and deeper.

What was going on?

Was she already hallucinating because of the spiciness?

This shouldn’t be the case. This had never happened to her before.

At this moment, the man pursed his lips and narrowed his eyes. “Do you really want me to try it?”

As he spoke, the man stood up.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion. She didn’t know why Gu Zhou still had to stand up to eat duck neck, but she still tried to persuade him in all seriousness. “You can give it a try. This one is especially… um…”

Before Qiao Nian could finish her sentence, Gu Zhou had already bent down and pressed his lips against hers, silencing her words.

A spicy, sweet taste filled her mouth!

Steaming hot…

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief. Her eyes were wide open. Gu Zhou’s eyes were closed, and his long, curly eyelashes were almost touching her face. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Qiao Nian frowned and tried to break free.

However, the moment she moved, the man’s hand grabbed the back of her head, forcing her to stop moving.

“You…”

Qiao Nian’s words were instantly lost in the man’s mouth. Without hesitation, Gu Zhou took another step forward, pressing himself against her. He reached into her mouth and tasted her carefully.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but blush. She could smell the faint scent of mint from Gu Zhou’s mouth. Thinking of Gu Zhou’s actions, she felt both shy and puzzled.

Was Gu Zhou crazy?

How could he kiss her?

There must have been some spicy duck neck sauce stuck to her lips just now. How could Gu Zhou kiss her just like that?

How strange.

Wasn’t Gu Zhou a clean freak?

Then why did he still kiss her?

Qiao Nian thought dazedly. Her mind was a little dizzy from the lack of oxygen, and she saw fireworks.

After a long while, Gu Zhou finally let go of Qiao Nian.

When Qiao Nian breathed in the fresh air, she couldn’t stop panting. It took her a long time to regain her senses.

She looked at Gu Zhou in confusion and asked, “You…”

“Yes, it’s indeed not too spicy. It tastes pretty good.” Gu Zhou licked his lips as he spoke, interrupting Qiao Nian seriously.

Qiao Nian was confused.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief. So Gu Zhou was testing the spiciness of the duck neck.

She felt a little unwell now.

“You…”

Before Qiao Nian could finish her sentence, Gu Zhou kissed her again, but this time, it wasn’t as violent as the last time. Instead, it was just a light peck.

Qiao Nian blinked in confusion.

“The taste is still very spicy!”

Qiao Nian was shocked.

Qiao Nian no longer knew how to describe her feelings. She suddenly felt that the duck neck wasn’t that delicious either, because Gu Zhou had already successfully ruined her appetite.

How annoying!

Qiao Nian stood up coldly and was about to go upstairs to practice her violin when she saw Jiang Yue walking down the stairs.

Jiang Yue seemed to have been petrified. Shock and disbelief were written all over her face.

She had never expected Gu Zhou to take the initiative to kiss someone. Moreover, that person had food stains on her mouth.

Jiang Yue still remembered when she was 16 years old. She had sat on the sofa with Grandma and watched television together with her. At that time, the male and female leads in the television series were hugging and kissing sweetly.

She still remembered the disgust in Brother Ah Zhou’s eyes, as if kissing was the most disgusting thing in the world.

But Brother Ah Zhou had just taken the initiative to kiss Qiao Nian, and not just once.

Gu Zhou seemed to have noticed Jiang Yue’s presence as well. His voice was low and hoarse as he questioned, “What can I do for you?”
