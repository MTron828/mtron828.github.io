1082 Going to Jail?

Qiao Nian looked at Qiao Xin’s disheveled state and said with a smile, “You’re thinking too much. How could we bully you? Do you think your gang rape video is enough punishment just because it’s posted online? Aren’t you a little too naive?”

Qiao Xin looked at Qiao Nian in shock and asked shakily, “What do you mean by that?”

“Your video was posted online only because you were stupid. Who asked you to go over yourself? I wasn’t the one who kidnapped you!” Qiao Nian paused for a moment and continued, “This has nothing to do with you committing a crime!”

Criminal?

Could it be that Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian had called the police?

Only then did Qiao Xin react!

Qiao Xin was no longer as calm as before. She shook her head and said in a panic, “Impossible, this is absolutely impossible!”

How could He Cheng betray her?

There was a deal between the two of them. If He Cheng betrayed him, the deal between the two of them would be canceled. He Cheng wouldn’t be able to get the money!

Qiao Xin suddenly recalled that He Cheng was worried that he would go to jail. He had listened to the Lu family and ruined her innocence.

Could it be that the Lu family had set He Cheng up?

Now was not the time to care about He Cheng!

Then were Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian really planning to send her to prison?

If she really went to jail, she felt that Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian would never let her out again.

She was only in her early twenties. She couldn’t accept that she would spend the rest of her life in prison!

But Qiao Yu was the only one who could save her!

Qiao Xin regretted saying those harsh words to Qiao Yu just now. Qiao Yu had always doted on her. As long as she acted like a spoiled child to Qiao Yu, he might help her!

At the thought of this, Qiao Xin limped over to Qiao Yu and looked at him with tears streaming down her face. She grabbed Qiao Yu’s hand and said tearfully, “Brother, I don’t want to go to jail. Help me!”

Qiao Yu looked at Qiao Xin, who was standing in front of him. Qiao Xin no longer looked as elegant and calm as before. At this moment, Qiao Xin looked distraught.

Qiao Yu frowned. Qiao Xin’s leg had been injured some time ago. The doctor had said that she had to recuperate well before her leg could recover.

In less than two days, videos of Qiao Xin being gang raped had spread online. It was precisely because of that incident that the doctor had said that Qiao Xin’s leg might become disabled!

Now, Qiao Xin was going to be sent to prison!

Qiao Yu looked at the pitiful Qiao Xin and couldn’t bear to see her like this!

His sister had long become an adult. She had done so many wrongs. She should be responsible for the wrongs she had done!

Qiao Yu looked at Qiao Xin seriously and comforted her softly. “Qiao Xin, you’ve indeed made a mistake in this matter. You’re the main culprit. If you turn yourself in now, the judge will definitely be lenient!”

“No!” Qiao Xin shook off Qiao Yu’s hand and shouted, “That’s impossible! I won’t turn myself in!”

Qiao Yu looked at Qiao Xin, who was about to go crazy. He frowned and said, “Whether you admit it or not, you’ve indeed done something wrong. If you turn yourself in, you’ll be able to come out sooner. But if you don’t, your sentence will definitely be longer!”

“I didn’t do anything wrong. I didn’t do anything wrong. Why should I turn myself in? I won’t do it again. I won’t!” Qiao Xin shook her head and looked at Qiao Yu in disappointment. “Brother, you don’t even have me in your heart anymore. You won’t help me anymore!”

“I’m helping you now!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Help me? You asked me to turn myself in, and you asked me to go to jail. Is that what you call helping me? You’re clearly pushing me into a fire pit!” Qiao Xin looked at Qiao Yu in disappointment, her tears falling uncontrollably.

Qiao Nian stood at the side and said casually, “You don’t have to turn yourself in, because you won’t have the chance anymore!”

Qiao Nian met Qiao Xin’s surprised gaze and smiled. She said lazily, “Looking at the time, the police should be here soon!”

Qiao Xin gasped. She glared at Qiao Nian with hatred written all over her face and cursed, “Qiao Nian, how dare you call the police?”

Qiao Nian didn’t speak. The sound of a police car came from the entrance of the Qiao family villa.

The smile on Qiao Nian’s face grew brighter. “They’re here to pick you up now!”

“No, I can’t go to jail!” Qiao Xin cried as she staggered back, limping towards the back garden!

“I can’t go to jail!” Qiao Xin said with teary eyes. Perhaps it was because she had walked too quickly, but she fell to the ground!
