1411 Forced In

Lu Qi stood at the side with a conflicted expression. She had wanted to look through the glass to see what was going on inside. Senior had lowered the curtain when he slept last night, so she couldn’t see what was going on inside at all.

Chen Qing walked over with breakfast and saw Lu Qi standing at the door with a conflicted expression.

At this moment, Lu Qi’s mind was filled with thoughts of whether she should enter Qin Chuan’s ward. She thought for a long time, but there was still no answer.

“Miss Lu.”

A voice from the side instantly pulled Lu Qi back to reality. Lu Qi’s face turned slightly red with embarrassment. When she saw that it was Chen Qing, an unnatural smile appeared on her face. “Secretary Chen.”

“Miss Lu, aren’t you going in?” Chen Qing asked.

Lu Qi looked at Chen Qing and hesitated for a moment before asking, “Secretary Chen, I want to ask you something.”

“What is it?”

“My senior brother.” As Lu Qi spoke, Qin Chuan’s handsome face appeared in her mind again. The tips of her ears turned red. She cleared her throat and pretended to be calm as she asked, “Has he lost his memory now?”

Chen Qing nodded and said, “Yes, Mr. Qin has already lost his memory!”

Lu Qi’s face instantly turned pale. She pursed her lips tightly, her eyes turning red.

No wonder Senior Brother’s words yesterday were so strange. So Senior Brother had really lost his memory!

Lu Qi blamed herself even more.

Seeing that Lu Qi was worried about Qin Chuan, Chen Qing hurriedly comforted her. “Miss Lu, you don’t have to worry too much. Young Madam has already diagnosed Mr. Qin. Mr. Qin’s condition is only temporary amnesia. It won’t affect his brain at all. He’ll recover all his memories after some time!”

When Lu Qi heard Chen Qing’s words, she heaved a sigh of relief. Thinking of what Senior Brother had said last night, her eyes filled with confusion.

Since Senior had already lost his memory, why did he think that they were already married?

Lu Qi’s frown deepened.

At this moment, Qin Chuan’s hoarse voice came from the ward.

“Is it Qi Qi?”

When Lu Qi heard Qin Chuan’s voice, her heart skipped a beat for some reason. Then, it began to race, as if it was about to jump out of her chest.

Lu Qi took a deep breath and tried hard to remain calm but her heart began to race. She was too embarrassed to meet her senior brother now.

Just as Lu Qi was about to slip away, Chen Qing had already calmly pushed open the door of the ward and answered Qin Chuan’s question on her behalf. “Mr. Qin, Miss Qi Qi is worried that you haven’t woken up. She’s been waiting outside!”

Lu Qi’s feet, which were about to slip back into the ward, seemed to be nailed to the ground. She didn’t know whether to leave or not. She yearned to find a place to hide. This was too awkward!

Lu Qi walked into the ward and pulled open the curtain beside Qin Chuan’s bed!

The white curtains of the bed were pulled open. Caught off guard, Lu Qi met Qin Chuan’s gentle eyes. At this moment, everything around her seemed to no longer exist. Qin Chuan was the only one left in her world.

He sat on the hospital bed, a faint smile in his eyes. His gaze was gentle.

Lu Qi’s heart was beating violently. She recalled what Qin Chuan had said last night.

“Husband and wife don’t have to thank each other!”

Husband and wife?

The two of them were not married at all!

Lu Qi felt that her face was especially hot. It was definitely as red as a monkey’s butt.

“Come in for dinner!” Qin Chuan said.

Lu Qi suddenly came back to her senses and saw that Chen Qing had already placed the food on the table of Qin Chuan’s bed. At this moment, she had completely forgotten about Song Yu and walked in uneasily.

Lu Qi sat opposite Qin Chuan. When she approached him, she could still smell the smell of blood and disinfectant on him. These two smells completely covered up Qin Chuan’s pleasant smell.

Chen Qing handed a bowl of porridge to Qin Chuan.

“Thank you.” Qin Chuan took the porridge from Chen Qing and nodded slightly.

Qin Chuan’s gaze landed on Lu Qi’s face. He handed the bowl to her and said in a low voice, “Have some too!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Chen Qing wanted to pass the other bowl of porridge to Lu Qi, but seeing that Qin Chuan had given it to her, he swiftly placed it in front of him.

Lu Qi took the bowl from Qin Chuan with a red face.
