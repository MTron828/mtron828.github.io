1276 Are you unhappy?

When Chang Feng heard Xiao Bao’s words, he squatted down and handed the binoculars to him. He said softly, “Take a look for yourself.”

Xiao Bao took the binoculars from Chang Feng and looked around for Qiao Nian.

Chang Feng heaved a sigh of relief and said, “Under the roller coaster, see if you can see your daddy and mommy.”

Xiao Bao nodded and looked down at the roller coaster with his binoculars. When he saw the two of them, he hurriedly put down the binoculars, and his eyes lit up. He looked at Chang Feng excitedly and asked, “Uncle Feng, I see Mommy and Second Daddy. They’re standing there. Can I look for them now?”

Chang Feng looked at Xiao Bao’s expectant eyes. His mind was filled with images of Xiao Bao since he was young, and he felt even worse. He squatted down and took Xiao Bao’s hands.

Xiao Bao looked at Chang Feng in confusion, his eyes filled with confusion. “Uncle Feng, are you unhappy?”

Chang Feng shook his head and smiled. “No, Xiao Bao. When you find your mommy, you have to remember to listen to them, understand?”

Xiao Bao was happy again. In the past, he had dreamed of being with his mommy. “Uncle Feng, I’ll definitely listen to Mommy and second Daddy. Xiao Bao has always been an obedient child!”

When Chang Feng heard Xiao Bao’s words, his eyes couldn’t help but turn red. He nodded. “Yes, Xiao Bao has always been very obedient. Let’s go!”

This time, Chang Feng wore a human skin mask and disguised himself as an ordinary-looking man. Holding Xiao Bao in one hand and his school bag in the other, he walked out. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

He knew very well that if he let go of Xiao Bao this time, he did not know when he would see him again.

The two of them bought tickets and entered the amusement park. Just as they were about to reach the roller coaster, Chang Feng stopped and placed Xiao Bao on the ground, then placed his school bag on his back.

The moment Xiao Bao carried his school bag, he almost lost his balance and fell. His legs trembled as he tried his best to stand up straight. He looked at Chang Feng beside him and frowned. He complained unhappily, “Uncle Feng, I just want to say a few words to Mommy. I’ll be going tonight. Why do I have to carry such a heavy school bag?”

Chang Feng’s heart skipped a beat. He looked down at Xiao Bao and tried hard to smile. He asked softly, “Xiao Bao, you’re already a big child. Can’t you carry this?”

When Xiao Bao heard this, he immediately straightened his back and said proudly, “Of course I can!”

“You’re a child of the Gu family. You have to work hard to bear the responsibility of the Gu family in the future. In the future, don’t tell anyone about Mr. Chen, let alone tell others that he’s your uncle,” Chang Feng instructed seriously.

Xiao Bao nodded and agreed obediently. “I know. He’s my daddy!”

Chang Feng was speechless.

Chang Feng shook his head and said solemnly, “In the future, don’t tell anyone that you know Mr. Chen, let alone that he’s your father. You can’t say that he’s your uncle either. Don’t tell anyone anything about Mr. Chen. You’re not even allowed to tell anyone where you lived previously. This is for your safety.”

Xiao Bao’s little face turned serious as well. He didn’t understand why Uncle Feng was telling him these things so seriously, but he was already used to listening to Uncle Feng. He nodded obediently and said, “Uncle Feng, I understand.”

It was a happy thing for him to be able to acknowledge his mommy, but why did he feel terrible now?

Xiao Bao pursed his lips, his eyes a little red. He asked in a low voice, “Uncle Feng, does Daddy not want me anymore?”

“No, Master was just afraid that someone would hurt you, so he instructed you in advance not to spout nonsense.” As Chang Feng spoke, he looked at Xiao Bao, who was about to cry, and felt even worse. “Don’t mention your previous living environment again. This is for your sake. Xiao Bao, there are too many bad people outside, and there are many people in the amusement park. We’re worried that something will go wrong. If others know about you, they might hurt you.”
