1132 Blood for Blood

Jiang Chi slowly closed his eyes. When he opened them again, his voice was as cold as ice. “Since we already know that the murderer was the one who kidnapped the eldest daughter of the Lu family back then, as long as we find that group of people, we’ll be able to find out which beast harmed my brother. I’ll definitely make him pay with his life!”

When Qiao Nian heard Jiang Chi’s words, she heaved a sigh of relief. Jiang Chi’s words meant that he would no longer be her enemy!

One more friend was better than one more enemy!

If Jiang Chi was an enemy, not only would they have to find the people who had kidnapped him back then, but they also had to guard against Jiang Chi stabbing them in the back!

!!

Moreover, Jiang Cheng had died because of her back then. It was precisely because of this that she did not want to be enemies with Jiang Chi.

Qiao Nian could completely understand Jiang Chi’s feelings. Jiang Cheng was a kind and gentle person. She had heard that he was a medical genius. Such a person would definitely have a bright future!

But Jiang Cheng’s life had been shortened because of her!

When she thought of these things, her heart ached too.

Suppressing her heartache, Qiao Nian looked at Jiang Chi seriously and said, “Then do you know who gave your brother the set of questions that he posted on the online forum?”

Jiang Chi looked down at the diary and said calmly, “I remember that an old gentleman gave it to him!”

Qiao Nian and Qin Chuan looked at each other. Qin Chuan asked impatiently, “Do you know that old gentleman’s surname?”

Jiang Chi frowned slightly and looked at Qin Chuan. “He had the same surname as you!”

Qin Chuan and Qiao Nian exchanged a look. The two of them immediately sat up straight in excitement.

Old Master Qin?

That was very likely Grandpa. After all, the questions had been set by Grandpa!

Jiang Chi retracted his gaze and carefully put away Jiang Cheng’s diary. This was a memory his younger brother had left for him. He had to keep it well!

Jiang Chi seemed to have thought of something and looked up at Lu Qi!

When Lu Qi met Jiang Chi’s gaze, although she could understand everything Jiang Chi had done previously, she really didn’t want to marry Jiang Cheng. She thought about how to persuade Jiang Chi to give up this bad idea!

Lu Qi immediately sat up straight and tensed up.

“Thank you!”

Just as Lu Qi was about to speak, she heard Jiang Chi thank her!

She was stunned!

Jiang Chi did not seem to be the kind of person who would thank her.

Lu Qi was stunned for a moment, not knowing how to answer!

Although she didn’t see Brother Jiang Cheng’s diary, she could guess from the conversation between her sister and Jiang Chi that Brother Jiang Cheng had helped her sister in the past. It was precisely because of this that Brother Jiang Cheng was killed by those people!

She had a good relationship with Brother Jiang Cheng, and he was also her idol. Since Jiang Chi had already thanked her, she should be more magnanimous and not pursue the matter with him.

When Lu Qi opened her mouth to say that it was fine, Jiang Chi had already stood up and walked out! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Lu Qi watched as Jiang Chi left. In the end, she said nothing.

After Jiang Chi left, Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. It seemed that Jiang Chi had already let go of the grudge with the Lu family.

Qiao Nian looked up at Qin Chuan with a smile in her eyes. “I think Grandpa must be living well. He should be in MY now.”

Gu Zhou’s gaze was unpredictable. In the end, he said in a low voice, “My brother should be in MY too.”

The three of them fell silent after that. They realized the same thing. MY had the answer they wanted.

Qiao Nian’s phone rang. She took it out and glanced at it before saying, “After I meet Mom, we’ll go to MY. Perhaps we can find some clues.”

Qin Chuan had been looking for Old Master Qin for so many years. One or two more days wouldn’t matter. He nodded and replied, “Okay.”

Gu Zhou naturally had no objections. In his opinion, it was more important to find those who were up to no good.

Qiao Nian looked at Lu Qi and said, “I’ll send you home. You must have been shocked this time!”

Lu Qi shook her head gently and said with a smile, “Sister, I’m fine. I can go back myself!”

“I—”

Before Qiao Nian could finish speaking, Qin Chuan, who was sitting at the side, said, “Why don’t I send Lu Qi home? The two of you can go back and rest. He doesn’t look well. Take a look at his condition.”

The “he” Qin Chuan was referring to was none other than Gu Zhou.
