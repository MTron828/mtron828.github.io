Chapter 369: Suspicion

Before she could finish speaking, she suddenly felt a cold gaze on her.

She followed his gaze and met Lu Yan’s sharp gaze.

Qin Lu’s breathing quickened. She silently looked away, not daring to continue.

Gu Zhou had been standing beside Qiao Nian the entire time. He could still clearly see Qiao Nian’s hands clenched into fists, her knuckles slightly white.

Gu Zhou’s brow furrowed slightly. He leaned closer and whispered into her ear, his voice soft and coaxing, “You don’t have to take anything they say to heart. I believe you. If you don’t want to continue being pestered by them, we’ll go home now!”

Gu Zhou’s voice was very gentle. It was like a feather gently brushing against her heart, making it tingle.

Qiao Nian looked up and inadvertently met Gu Zhou’s chestnut-colored eyes. His eyes were no longer as cold as before, but filled with gentleness.

So Gu Zhou had such a gentle side.

Actually, those things in the past no longer seemed so important now.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips and clenched her fists, as if she had made a decision.

She looked up at Mr. Jiang Qi, who was standing on the stage, and her lips curved up slightly. “Mr. Jiang, I think Qiao Yu is right. Isn’t it a little too rash to rely on just the drawing paper to determine the authenticity of the painting? Why don’t I teach you a way to appraise the authenticity of the painting?”

When everyone heard Qiao Nian’s impudent words, they all exploded!

“Then what does this mean? Is she questioning Mr. Jiang?”

......

“This woman doesn’t even have an invitation. If it weren’t for Young Master Gu, the security guards would have chased her out long ago. Where does her confidence come from?”

“That’s right. What right does she have to lecture Mr. Jiang? What does she know?”

…

Qiao Nian’s expression was as calm as ever. Her beautiful fox-like eyes swept across everyone present. “That’s because I’m Huang Shi!”

Although Qiao Nian’s voice wasn’t loud, the entire banquet hall could hear her.

For a moment, everyone was shocked. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Everyone looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief. It took them a long time to process Qiao Nian’s words.

One by one, they laughed and spoke sarcastically.

“Qiao Nian, have you gone crazy just because you want to be famous? How dare you say that you’re Mr. Huang Shi? You have to know that Mr. Huang Shi is a man, and you’re just a woman!”

“More than ten years ago, Mr. Huang Shi’s paintings were already well-known. They were loved by people all over the world. It’s obvious that more than ten years ago, you were just an insensible little girl. How could you be Mr. Huang Shi?”

“There must be something wrong with her brain!”

“Perhaps she’s desperate!”

…

Some people were still skeptical when they saw how calm Qiao Nian was.

“Is she mentally ill? That’s why she’s spouting nonsense on such an occasion!”

“That can’t be. I heard that she’s a doctor and has cultivated many expensive Chinese herbs!”

“Now that you mention it, I remember it too. I was there too!”

…

When Song Yu heard the words of the people around her, she frowned slightly. She had heard about Qiao Nian before.

However, she couldn’t believe that Qiao Nian was Mr. Huang Shi.

This was simply a fantasy!

More than ten years ago, Qiao Nian was just a child.

How could a child draw such a majestic painting?

On stage, Mr. Jiang Qi stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian. After a long while, he asked, “Miss Qiao, how do you plan to prove your identity?”

Qiao Nian had already decided to reveal her identity, so she didn’t hesitate to ask Chen Qing to bring the inkstone over.

Chen Qing’s heart skipped a beat. He looked up at Gu Zhou. Seeing Gu Zhou nod, he hurriedly went to prepare it.
