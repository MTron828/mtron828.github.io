Chapter 429: Another Imperial Jade

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ah Rao stood between Qiao Yu and Qiao Nian, protecting her behind him.

A trace of displeasure flashed across Qiao Yu’s eyes, and he said coldly, “Get out of the way!”

Ah Rao did not shrink back from Qiao Yu’s gaze at all. He said disapprovingly, “I’m Miss Qiao’s bodyguard. Now, her safety is up to me. I’ll only obey her!”

As Ah Rao spoke, he casually picked up the stone in his hand and said lazily, “It’s Miss Qiao’s freedom to wear whatever she likes. You have no right to interfere. Even if there’s danger, I’ll help her eliminate all threats!”

With that, Ah Rao turned to look at Qiao Nian, the corners of his lips curling up slightly. “It’s natural for girls to like being beautiful. Besides, she should show her most perfect side!”

Qiao Nian’s breathing tightened.

Oh my god.

This bodyguard was too good at flirting. Every word he said hit the nail on the head.

Qiao Nian’s mood, which had darkened because of Qiao Yu, instantly brightened. She nodded and said, “You’re right!”

Qiao Yu looked at the faint smile on Qiao Nian’s lips and frowned again.

At this moment, the air around them froze.

The old master looked up at Qiao Yu and said, “Congratulations, Mr. Qiao. You’ve obtained a blood jadeite!”

Only then did the tense atmosphere ease.

......

Qiao Yu put away the serious expression on his face and walked towards the old master.

Qiao Nian tilted her head to look and saw a palm-sized blood jade in the old master’s hand. Its surface was smooth, and there was no trace of impurities inside. It was as red as blood.

Qiao Nian raised her eyebrows slightly.

Although this piece of blood jade was not as valuable as the imperial jade in her hand, it was definitely not less than 200 million.

Qiao Nian’s gaze landed on the price of the raw stone. Thirty million.

It seemed that Qiao Yu had earned a lot this time.

Indeed, people who lived in the upper-class society more or less knew a little about stone gambling.

The host quickly congratulated him.

At this moment, the other cutters shouted, “Oh my god, another imperial green!”

When everyone heard this voice, they were all stunned.

Oh my god, there were actually two imperial jade stones this time.

Everyone hurriedly ran over. The color and size of the imperial jade was only slightly inferior to the one Qiao Nian had opened. It was considered top-grade.

Qiao Nian took a look. The price of the raw material was 20 million.

Everyone felt like they could barely breathe.

Oh my god, 20 million for imperial jade.

In the past, the price of imperial jade raw materials was at least 50 million.

It was already rare for Qiao Nian to get imperial jade for 200 yuan. Of course, 20 million yuan was also very little.

However, everyone said that Qiao Nian had relied on luck just now. Then, was that person just now also so lucky?

What was going on today?

There were actually so many experts in the world of stone gambling.

Everyone was very curious as to who had obtained the second imperial jade.

They saw a young girl pick up the imperial jade with a smile. She turned to look at the media and bowed slightly, looking elegant and gentle.

Qiao Nian’s beautiful fox eyes narrowed slightly. It was Song Yue.

Hadn’t she been chased away by Lu Zhu?

Unexpectedly, Song Yue was quite capable. She was actually standing here as a participant.

At this moment, Song Yue was no longer as flustered and ferocious as before. Instead, she exuded confidence and elegance.

Qiao Nian had never thought that Song Yue would really be able to get an imperial jade. It seemed that she had underestimated her.

Song Yue was really dazzling in her field of expertise. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Song Yue’s eyes curved into crescents when she smiled. She looked at Qiao Nian and Lu Zhu, as if silently challenging them.

Song Yue clenched the imperial jade in her hand tightly. She wanted to regain all the face she had lost previously.

Moreover, Jiang Chi had said that he would help her.

This time, Lu Zhu and Qiao Nian were definitely going to lose!
