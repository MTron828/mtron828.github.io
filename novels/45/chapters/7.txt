Chapter 8: Investigate Qiao Nian!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Gu Zhou still remembered the words of the doctors who had treated his illness in the past. They said that his chances of recovery were less than ten percent. Many people asserted that he would not live past twenty, but he had managed to live for five more years through tremendous effort.

This woman clearly overestimated her own abilities. She actually said that she had a 70% chance of curing him.

In the field of medicine, a 70% chance was already very high! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Gu Zhou’s gaze landed on Qiao Nian’s face and a trace of ice flashed in his eyes. Taking his time, he asked, “Seventy percent?”

Seeing that Gu Zhou didn’t believe her, Qiao Nian crossed her legs and leaned forward slightly. She said, “Did the doctors you sought say that your chances were less than 10%? They’re not exactly wrong. I’m guessing that most of them are doctors of Western medicine!”

Gu Zhou glanced coldly at Qiao Nian and rubbed the jade ring on his finger in a habitual motion, looking as if he was mulling over her words.

Qiao Nian was right. Most of the doctors he sought were doctors of Western medicine, and he had never thought of Chinese medicine.

After all, modern medical science was advanced. Western medicine could treat his symptoms directly, according to his condition.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s jade ring. The quality of this jade was similar to the jade pendant that the man had given her five years ago. She had to get it back when she returned home.

“Actually, even if you found a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner, there aren’t many who can treat your illness.” Qiao Nian tucked her hair behind her ear and said seriously, “The main focus of my research is toxins.”

A bright smile appeared on Gu Zhou’s face, concealing the murderous intent in his eyes.

It seemed that Qiao Nian was really here to target the Gu family.

Gu Zhou left after receiving a call. Qiao Nian walked back to the bathroom and used a hairdryer to dry her hair. When she returned to her room, she saw that she had received a text from Old A.

Qiao Nian immediately dialed Old A’s number. The call went through, but before she could speak, Old A’s anxious voice came through the phone.

“Nian Nian, what did you do? Why is someone investigating you?”

Qiao Nian looked out of the window at the garden, basking in the sun. Puzzled, she asked, “Who wants to investigate me?”

“Someone from the Gu family. H-his name is Gu Zhou!” Old A seemed helpless. Letting out a long sigh, he said, “The Gu family has power and influence. But don’t worry, I have ways to help you block their advances!”

“There’s no need for that. Just give him the information you found.” With that, Qiao Nian hung up on Old A. She was about to leave her room when her phone rang again.

“Nian Nian, how have you been?”

A flirtatious male voice came through the phone. Hearing the man’s voice, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but smile. Her red lips moved slightly as she spoke. “I’m investigating what happened five years ago!”

At the other end of the call, a man was leaning lazily on a chair, one hand supporting his chin. One could tell with just a single look that his casual suit was very expensive.

Beneath his light brown short hair was a fair face. His facial features had a sort of feminine beauty, with a straight and defined nose. He looked up, and those beautiful black eyes were like glittering bright stars.

“Nian Nian, I heard that you’re out of the mental hospital. When are you free? Let’s get our marriage certificate!”

When Qiao Nian heard Mu Cheng’s words, she couldn’t help but laugh out loud. Mu Cheng hadn’t changed, and he evidently still loved to joke around. She replied, “I don’t have the time to register our marriage, but I could treat you to a meal.”

Mu Cheng lowered his gaze, hiding the loneliness in his eyes. He couldn’t help but doubt himself. Was it because he wasn’t sincere enough? Why did Qiao Nian always treat his words as a joke?

“Sure, I’m free always. Call me when you’re free.” Mu Cheng’s lips curved into a bitter smile. He looked at the information sent over by his subordinate on the computer and said, “You’re not the only one investigating the incident at the Star Hotel five years ago. Gu Zhou is too!”

Confusion rose in Qiao Nian’s eyes. She frowned slightly and thanked Mu Cheng. After exchanging a few pleasantries, she hung up.

Gu Zhou was investigating the same incident?

Qiao Nian thought of the jade ring in Gu Zhou’s hand. She had a vague notion that the man from five years ago was very likely to be someone Gu Zhou knew.

The next time Qiao Nian saw Gu Zhou was when the time came for her to visit her family. He still looked impassive.

When they arrived at the Qiao family villa, Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou got out of the car together.

When Butler Zhang of the Qiao family saw the couple, he was shocked by the cold aura that enshrouded Gu Zhou. He could not figure out who this man was.

“Second Young Madam, shall I go in and inform the family?” Butler Zhang said shakily, his legs trembling non-stop.

At Butler Zhang’s words, Qiao Nian quickly stopped him and said, “There’s no need; you can leave. We’ll go in directly.”

Hearing that, Butler Zhang privately heaved a sigh of relief and left quickly.

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on the entire Qiao residence. Although he and Qiao Nian did not hold a wedding, the Gu villa was decorated with lanterns and colored banners and looked very festive.. However, there was nothing like that in the Qiao villa.
