1444 Sad

The four of them continued climbing. About an hour later, Lina’s phone rang.

Lina looked up. She estimated that she would be able to climb up in another half an hour. She looked at the man-made pavilion not far away and suggested, “Let’s rest for a while, then climb up in one go?”

Qiao Nian nodded. She had no objections. “Okay.”

Qiao Nian walked towards the pavilion. Chen Qing and David followed. Seeing that they had reached the pavilion, Lina picked up the call.

“Dad!”

“Who are you going to Bear Mountain with?” The European President’s voice was slightly low, and he seemed to be a little unhappy.

Lina frowned slightly. “I’m here with Madam Gu!”

Lina knew that the person who had been secretly protecting her must have told her father about her and Qiao Nian at Bear Mountain.

Yesterday, she had only told her father that she was going to climb Bear Mountain. She had not told her father who she was going to climb with.

“Madam Gu? Gu Zhou’s wife?” The European President asked uncertainly.

“Yes, she and I are good friends now. I…”

“Why didn’t you tell me you were going out with her?” The European president sounded a little displeased.

Lina didn’t understand why her father didn’t want her to interact with people from An City, but Nian Nian was a good person, and Nian Nian’s medical skills were very good. After some thought, she said what was on her mind. “Dad, Madam Gu’s medical skills are very good. I want to invite her to take a look at Mom’s illness tomorrow.”

The person on the other end of the cell phone paused for two seconds, then said coldly, “You’re simply fooling around!”

Lina’s expression changed slightly. Her father had never said such harsh words to her. Today, he actually…

Her father had said in the past that she had to be more careful when interacting with the people of An City. He didn’t want them to see through her thoughts, especially not to leak information about her mother.

But her mother was sick now. Nian Nian’s medical skills were so good. Why couldn’t he let Nian Nian treat her mother?

Lina really didn’t understand why her father had rejected her good intentions.

“Lina.” The president lowered his voice, as if he was trying hard to suppress the anger in his heart. “How many times have I told you before? You can’t tell outsiders anything about your mother. Have you forgotten?”

“I haven’t forgotten, but Nian Nian…”

“You don’t have to say anything else. I won’t let anyone with ulterior motives treat your mother’s illness.” After the president finished speaking, he paused for a moment and continued, “You went out with her. I think you know very well what to say and what not to say!”

With that, the president hung up mercilessly.

Listening to the busy tone coming from the cell phone, Lina’s heart gradually sank to the bottom, and her face turned pale.

Her father usually treated her very well, but as long as it involved her mother, her father would become different from before.

Although she knew very well that her father was protecting her mother and that he was doing his best to treat her illness, she had a feeling that Nian Nian would definitely be able to help her mother!

It seemed that it would not be easy to get her father to agree to let Nian Nian treat her mother’s illness. She had to convince her father well.

Lina took a deep breath and tried hard to remain calm. She walked towards the pavilion.

Although she maintained a calm expression, her eyes were still filled with disappointment.

Qiao Nian looked at Lina’s disappointed expression. She wanted to ask something, but she thought that if Lina wanted to say something, she would definitely take the initiative to say it.

At this moment, Chen Qing walked up to Lina with a gentle smile on his face. “Seventh Princess, you must be tired after climbing the mountain for so long. Why don’t you eat something now?”

As Chen Qing spoke, he handed a sandwich and water to Lina.

Lina looked at the things in Chen Qing’s hand and glanced at her chauffeur, David, from the corner of her eye. She thought to herself that David was far inferior to Chen Qing. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Thank you.” Lina took the sandwich and was about to take the bottle of water when she saw Chen Qing swiftly unscrew the cap.

Lina’s mood improved a little. She smiled at Chen Qing and said, “Thank you.”

Holding the food, Lina sat down beside Qiao Nian. Looking at the scenery beside her, she smiled and said, “The scenery here is really good. The air is much fresher than in the city.”
