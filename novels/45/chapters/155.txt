Chapter 156 Cheap Goods

Everyone’s interest was piqued. One by one, they looked over curiously. They wanted to know which family’s daughter had arranged such a grand procession. Jiang Yue was slightly stunned. She had a bad feeling. Could it be that these people were here to pass Qiao Nian a gown?

The five girls walked up to Qiao Nian, holding the gowns.

“Miss Qiao, we really didn’t know what style you liked, so we brought you ten different pieces. Take a look and see if you like them. If not, I’ll return to the studio to get more!”

The respect in the young girl’s voice made one feel that Qiao Nian was some big shot who was undercover.

A smile lingered at the corner of Qiao Nian’s lips. She said gratefully, “It’s been hard on you this time. I can wear anything. Just pick one for

me.”

The onlookers’ gazes fell on the ten gowns. They pursed their lips. These were indeed cheap goods. Otherwise, how could ten gowns be sent over all at once?

“Perhaps she bought them on the Internet for cheap. That’s why they brought so many over!”

“Exactly. Didn’t you realize that it’s only been half an hour since the call? Yet, these young ladies have already brought the gowns here.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“That’s right. What sort of family can produce so many formal gowns at once?”

“Qiao Nian is so pretentious. She’s deliberately putting on such a grand show. No matter how her speech goes today, Qiao Nian will definitely leave a lasting impression on everyone!”

However, there were still some who spoke truthfully.

“Why do I feel that the whole set-up looks quite classy?”

“Classy? How can these clothes compare to Matriarch Gu’s handmade gown?”

“Actually, I think these gowns shouldn’t be too bad either. Think about it. Director Lin invited Qiao Nian here specially. Someone whom Director Lin invites personally must be someone quite extraordinary!”

Seeing that some people were speaking up for Qiao Nian, Liu Yu’s expression instantly darkened. She glared fiercely at that girl and said angrily, “What nonsense are you spouting? Has a donkey kicked you in the head? What can she do? Big shot? You’re thinking too much.”

When the surrounding people heard Liu Yu’s words, they all frowned in disapproval, unwilling to pay her any attention.

Jiang Yue stood at the side. She felt that her waist area was slightly uncomfortable, and it was only getting worse and worse. It must be because of the gown she was wearing. She no longer dared to breathe, worried that the zipper would suddenly fly open. Jiang Yue only hoped that this gown would last until her speech ended. Hearing the words of the onlookers, the five girls removed the black cloths.

In an instant, everyone present was stunned.

Goodness.

These ten gowns were too beautiful. They were not in any way inferior to the gown designed by Matriarch Gu. Moreover, they spanned a wide range of styles.

Every gown was elegant, luxurious, and yet not flashy. They were very suitable for the current theme.

Qiao Nian glanced at Jiang Yue and finally chose a black gown.

When Lin Tao saw this, she couldn’t help but laugh. She was now looking forward to seeing Qiao Nian in a gown. How breathtaking would that be!

When everyone saw Qiao Nian pick the black gown, they began whispering among themselves. They felt that Qiao Nian was challenging Jiang Yue.

At first glance, Liu Yu was also stunned by these gowns, but she couldn’t believe that a country bumpkin would have the money to buy such expensive gowns. She asked uncertainly, “These… these gowns are all high-end replicas, aren’t they…”

“Is that even a question? They must be fake!” A girl who was close to Liu Yu chimed in.

When one of the girls who had brought the dresses heard Liu Yu’s words, she frowned. These people had gone too far. What a bunch of idiots! They didn’t know priceless when it was staring them in the face. She said coldly, “These dresses are designed by the world-famous Elena. If you don’t know anything, shut up. You’re embarrassing

yourself!”

Elena.

That was a top designer from another country. She was rumored to be on par with Matriarch Gu in terms of fame. Moreover, it was rumored that her main focus was on making gowns for the royal family.
