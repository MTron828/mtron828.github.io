1323 Nightmare

Qiao Nian sat there panting heavily, her forehead covered in cold sweat.

Gu Zhou reached out and pulled Qiao Nian into his arms. He patted her shoulder gently and comforted her. “Don’t be afraid. It’s fine. It’ll be fine.”

She looked at Gu Zhou with red-rimmed eyes. She grabbed Gu Zhou’s arm and said anxiously, “Where’s Chen Qing? I have something to ask Chen Qing. Call him over.”

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian. Her face was pale, and her voice was trembling. Even her body was trembling.

What was she afraid of?

Gu Zhou held Qiao Nian’s hand tightly and comforted her gently. “Nian’er, what happened? Did you have a nightmare?”

Qiao Nian tried hard to regulate her breathing. When she heard Gu Zhou’s concerned words, she reached out and held his hand. Her eyes were red as she sniffled and said in a choked voice, “I just dreamed of Eldest Senior Brother.”

She gasped, pursed her lips, and said softly, “I dreamed that he came to say goodbye to me in a white suit, but before he could finish speaking, blood seemed to stain his suit. Is he…”

Although Qiao Nian didn’t believe in ghosts and gods, she shot Eldest Senior Brother in the leg today. She said in fear, “Will he…”

“Nian’er.” Gu Zhou pulled Qiao Nian into his arms and gently kissed her forehead. He patted Qiao Nian’s back as if he was coaxing a child and said in a low voice, “Do you remember what old people often say?”

“Huh?” Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou with red-rimmed eyes. She really regretted firing back then. If she hadn’t fired and pricked the other party with a silver needle, wouldn’t Eldest Senior Brother not have been injured?

“Nian’er, dreams are the opposite of reality. This means that Chang Feng is fine. Don’t worry,” Gu Zhou comforted her.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou and shook her head hesitantly. In a low voice, she said, “No, I can feel that that dream was especially real. I was really afraid…”

Towards the end, Qiao Nian lowered her gaze guiltily and said sadly, “I hurt Eldest Senior Brother.”

Her mind was filled with images of Eldest Senior Brother’s leg being injured by her.

For the first time, she hated herself for being so accurate. If her marksmanship was not accurate, would Eldest Senior Brother not have been injured?

Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou with red-rimmed eyes, but her gaze was exceptionally firm. She said, “Call Chen Qing over now. I have something to ask.”

Seeing that Qiao Nian was very persistent, Gu Zhou called Chen Qing.

Qiao Nian stood up and sat by the bed, her mind filled with thoughts of Eldest Senior Brother being injured.

Gu Zhou held Qiao Nian’s hand tightly and comforted her softly. “Don’t worry, Chang Feng’s leg is just injured. If his leg is injured, his life won’t be in danger.”

Qiao Nian nodded slightly, but her heart was still in a mess.

Before long, Chen Qing knocked and entered.

After Chen Qing walked in, he said, “Second Young Master.”

Without waiting for Gu Zhou to speak, Qiao Nian spoke first. “Chen Qing, other than my Eldest Senior Brother’s leg, was he injured in any other way when they retreated?” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

When Chen Qing heard Qiao Nian’s words, he frowned.

Previously, he had heard from his subordinates that the person with the injured leg had also been shot in the abdomen.

He knew that person was Chang Feng.

However, he didn’t report it directly to the clueless Young Madam because he didn’t want her to worry.

He looked at Qiao Nian. Her eyes were red. It was obvious that Qiao Nian was worried about Chang Feng. In order to reassure Qiao Nian, he denied it. “No.”

Qiao Nian raised her eyebrows slightly and looked at Chen Qing in disbelief. When she had asked Chen Qing just now, Chen Qing had thought for a while before answering, so he had asked again, “Really?”

Chen Qing nodded and said, “It’s true.”

Qiao Nian’s expression turned even more serious. She clenched her fists tightly and looked at Chen Qing’s face seriously. She said doubtfully, “But you hesitated when you answered my question just now.”

Chen Qing was slightly stunned. He looked up at Qiao Nian.

Seeing Chen Qing’s gaze, Qiao Nian’s heart jumped to her throat. She asked anxiously, “Hurry up and tell the truth. Is my Eldest Senior Brother injured?”

Gu Zhou was lying on the hospital bed. He could tell that Chen Qing was hiding something. “Tell me the truth!”

Chen Qing pursed his lips tightly. In the end, he sighed helplessly and said, “My subordinates said that when he retreated, he helped someone take a bullet.”

“Blocked a bullet? Where was he injured?”

“Abdomen.”
