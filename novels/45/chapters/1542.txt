Chapter 1543 Something's Wrong

Chen Qing, who was walking in front, seemed to hear Lina's cry. He turned around and saw that Lina was about to fall. He hurriedly supported her.

He held Lina's hand with his left hand and wrapped his right arm around her waist.

The moment he touched Lina's waist, Chen Qing frowned imperceptibly, but he quickly regained his composure.

After Chen Qing helped Lina steady herself, he let go and asked, "Seventh Princess, are you injured?"

The mountain was rugged. If Lina sprained her ankle, it would be troublesome.

When Lina heard Chen Qing's concerned voice, she could still feel that the places Chen Qing had just touched her were still burning. The heat flowed through her blood to every part of her body.

Her ears were red, and she did not dare to look into Chen Qing's eyes. Naturally, she did not see the coldness and alienation in Chen Qing's eyes.

"I'm fine. Let's continue searching. When the time comes, we have to rush back!" Lina looked around, flustered. She felt that the mountain looked like it was going to eat her alive.

Could it be because it was dark and raining?

Lina glanced at the flashlight. Fortunately, it was waterproof. "Let's continue searching."

…

On the other side, when Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou were searching for Colorful Fungus, they realized that it was raining. The two of them saw a protruding stone not far away and hid under it.

Qiao Nian remembered that when they went out today, the sun was not bad. She didn't expect it to rain halfway.

Qiao Nian stood under the stone and looked at the rain on the ground. She frowned slightly and said worriedly, "It's raining. The soil and stones will definitely become very slippery. Lina doesn't have any experience in this field either. I wonder if they'll be in danger."

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian's words, he reached out and held her hand. Realizing that her hand was very cold, he took off his jacket and covered Qiao Nian's shoulders with it. He comforted her softly, "Don't worry, Chen Qing has experience in this field."

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou's words, she couldn't help but smile. She asked curiously, "Is there anything Chen Qing doesn't know?"

Placing tiles, fighting, wilderness survival skills, and sometimes going to Africa to dig coal.

To be honest, she wanted to find an all-rounder to follow her.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian's face gently and said with a smile, "Chen Qing is an orphan. He was saved by your Eldest Senior Brother back then. Later on, it was your Eldest Senior Brother who taught him these things." Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Eldest Senior Brother.

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned, a trace of worry flashing in her eyes.

After so long, she wondered how Eldest Senior Brother was doing.

She regretted shooting Eldest Senior Brother back then.

Qiao Nian felt a little upset. She looked ahead in silence, her gaze inadvertently landing on the umbrella-shaped mushroom floating in the rain. Her eyes lit up and she said excitedly, "Look, it's the Blue Fungus!"

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian in confusion. "What does it do?"

Could it be that this Blue Fungus had some unique effect?

Qiao Nian's lips curved up slightly. Smiling, she explained, "Blue Fungus often live with Colorful Fungus. I think we should be able to find color-streaming bacteria nearby!"

At the thought that they would be able to find Colorful Fungus this time, Qiao Nian's heart, which had been in her throat, finally settled back down.

However, Gu Zhou wasn't as happy as Qiao Nian. He looked around. The mountain roads nearby were rugged, especially where the blue-breathing fungus grew. It seemed to be by the cliff. It was too dangerous.

If it was a sunny day, one had to be fully prepared for rock climbing. However, the weather was bad now, and the soil and stones were slippery. If one slipped, the matter would be serious.

Gu Zhou frowned at Qiao Nian and said in a low voice, "It's too dangerous to go now. I'll call someone over."

Qiao Nian smiled and nodded. In any case, the colorful fungus didn't have legs and wouldn't run. There was no difference whether they searched for it earlier or later, so she agreed readily.

Gu Zhou took out his walkie-talkie and was about to contact his people when there was no movement from the walkie-talkie.

Either the walkie-talkie was out of range, or someone had cut off all signals.
