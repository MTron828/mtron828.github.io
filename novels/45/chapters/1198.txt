However, before Ye Sen could finish speaking, Lu Jiang interrupted him without hesitation and said calmly, “Mr. Ye Sen, if you don’t want to gamble on stones anymore, please leave!”

Thank you readers!

Although Lu Jiang’s tone was as calm as ever, Ye Sen could see Lu Jiang’s impatience in his eyes.

Ye Sen frowned. He was not afraid of Boss Jin, but he did not dare to go against Lu Jiang. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Lu Jiang’s banks were all over the world. Not only that, but many people knew that Lu Jiang was well-versed in both legitimate businesses and the underworld. Not many people in this world could stand at his level.

Suppressing his dissatisfaction and anger, Ye Sen turned around and walked out.

Seeing Ye Sen leave, the bodyguards Ye Sen had brought hurriedly followed.

The tense atmosphere instantly disappeared, and the banquet hall returned to its original calm.

Seeing Ye Sen’s men leave, Jiang Yue heaved a sigh of relief.

She looked calm on the surface, but she was actually very flustered. She was worried that Boss Jin would really give her to Ye Sen.

Boss Jin turned to look at Jiang Yue. Seeing that Jiang Yue’s face was pale, he reached out and pulled her into his arms. He gently caressed Jiang Yue’s face and said gently, “Are you frightened?”

Jiang Yue forced a smile and continued, “Thank you, Godfather. Without you, I wouldn’t know what to do.”

Jiang Yue looked at Boss Jin pitifully. Any man who saw her would feel pity for her.

Seeing how obedient Jiang Yue was, Boss Jin lowered his head and kissed her forehead before taking her to look at the raw stones.

“Oh my god, Boss Jin is so brave. He actually went against Ye Sen for a woman.”

“Yes. Didn’t Boss Jin like to give women away casually in the past? Now, he’s actually protecting his woman.”

“That woman called Jiang Yue is really not simple!”

“Isn’t that so? I think Boss Jin might really like Jiang Yue!”

“I think so too!”

…

Qiao Nian watched as Boss Jin and Jiang Yue left. Just now, Boss Jin had gone against Ye Sen for Jiang Yue.

It seemed that Boss Jin really liked Jiang Yue.

However, did Jiang Yue like Boss Jin?

Qiao Nian pursed her lips slightly. Although she hadn’t interacted much with Jiang Yue, Jiang Yue was a scheming person. It definitely wasn’t that simple for Jiang Yue to be by Boss Jin’s side.

Just as Qiao Nian was thinking, Chen Qing quickly walked in and said in a low voice, “Second Young Master and Second Young Madam, Mr. Chen is here!”

When she heard the words “Mr. Chen”, Qiao Nian hurriedly came back to her senses.

In a daze, she recalled the dream she had previously. In the dream, she had almost married Mr. Chen. In the hall, a group of people had even appeared to chase after her, and Mr. Chen had perished with those people for her!

Everything in the dream was as real as if it had happened before.

Hearing the sound of the earpiece, Lu Jiang walked towards Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian. He also knew that Mr. Chen had arrived.

He walked up to Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian and said seriously, “He’s here. I’ll greet him first.”

Gu Zhou nodded.

Qiao Nian hesitated for a moment, then nodded. Actually, she didn’t know if she should go.

If she went over, her intentions would be too obvious. It wouldn’t be good if Mr. Chen noticed.

Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou. Seeing Gu Zhou’s serious expression, she knew that he was still worried about his brother. She said in a low voice, “Don’t worry, we’ll definitely find your brother.”

“Yes, I’ll test him when the time comes,” Gu Zhou said calmly, his dark eyes surging.

The last call Jiang Cheng made before he died was to Mr. Chen. She didn’t know if Mr. Chen was involved in the kidnapping of the eldest daughter twenty years ago.

However, according to the timeline, she was three years old when she was kidnapped. At that time, Mr. Chen was not even fifteen years old. Logically speaking, it was impossible for Mr. Chen to participate in the kidnapping twenty years ago.

After all, would a child be so scheming?
