Chapter 42: Sowing Discord

When Su Yan heard Qiao Xin’s words, the slightly favorable impression he just formed of Qiao Nian instantly vanished.

He knew it. How could Qiao Nian not like him, Su Yan?

Back then, Qiao Nian had even burned down a school building for him.

“She’s still as disgusting as ever,” Su Yan sneered.

Qiao Xin flushed. She spoke up for Qiao Nian. “Actually, Sister didn’t do anything wrong. Don’t keep getting angry at her.”

Su Yan frowned, but remained quiet.

Qiao Xin continued to persuade him. “Just by attending the party, Sister was framed. If she wasn’t so smart, she might have made a fool of herself. Look, my sister is still as clever as ever!”

“Qiao Xin, you’re too kind! Qiao Nian must have been really lucky in her past life to gain a good sister like you,” Su Yan said with a serious expression.

Qiao Xin smiled and shook her head. She replied sweetly, “Brother Su Yan, don’t say that. She’s my sister. In the past, she often used to take care of me.”

Hearing Qiao Xin’s words, Su Yan felt that Qiao Xin was truly an obedient and sensible girl. She was the complete opposite of Qiao Nian, who only knew how to cause trouble.

Seeing Su Yan’s approving expression, Qiao Xin lowered her gaze coquettishly. Her lips curved up a little.

She was determined to make Gu Zhou hate Qiao Nian just like Su Yan did. She would make Gu Zhou fall in love with her but dance out of reach—she would make Gu Zhou pine for her!

“You wretch! Hurry up and apologize!” Matriarch Shen looked at Shen Xing in exasperation and anger, her brow furrowed tightly. “All else aside, just consider the drugging incident tonight. Someone has tampered with your dress. This has nothing to do with Qiao Nian.”

Shen Xing’s eyes were red-rimmed, and her tears fell uncontrollably.

Shen Xing had initially thought that she would be able to find clues regarding her sister’s disappearance this time round, but she did not expect to suffer a double loss.

She understood clearly that if she didn’t apologize, tonight’s matter would no longer just be between Qiao Nian and herself. Instead, it would be between the Shen family and the Gu family.

And the Shen family could not afford to offend the Gu family.

“I-I’m sorry!” Shen Xing said with extreme reluctance. One by one, her tears fell onto the cobblestones below her feet.

“Miss Qiao, our Xing Xing was in the wrong. Her reputation has been damaged because of you; surely that’s enough punishment. I hope that you’ll be the bigger person and grant her forgiveness.” Smiling, Shen Ming tried to smooth things over.

Qiao Nian’s eyes suddenly lit up. She smiled back at Shen Ming and asked, “Mr. Shen, I agree that Miss Shen Xing’s reputation has been damaged, but this has nothing to do with me. Instead of investigating who touched her gown, you’re pinning the blame on me. Do you think I’m weak and easy to bully?”

Weak? Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Easy to bully?

The corner of Shen Ming’s mouth spasmed, and several conflicting emotions flashed across his face. He hurriedly left with Shen Xing.

Qiao Nian didn’t want to stay any longer either, so she made her goodbyes.

When she arrived at the door of the Shen family’s house, a young master who reeked of alcohol strode over. Stopping Qiao Nian in her tracks, he stared unblinkingly at her. “Hey, gorgeous, wanna hang out?”

Suppressing her rage, Qiao Nian said coldly, “Please move aside!”

“Oh, you even smell good!” The man said, sniffing Qiao Nian hard. “Do play with me. I’m rich, you know!”

Brazenly, the man looked Qiao Nian up and down, his eyes full of lasciviousness. “What a figure!”

Pursing her lips, Qiao Xin glared coldly at the man. Her blood was boiling with rage. She turned away and walked around the man, heading outside.

The man continued barring her way with utmost persistence. He yearned to take off his clothes right there and then and spend a whole night with this beauty.

Qiao Nian quickened her pace, her face slightly flushed.

Previously, she had indeed fallen into Shen Xing’s trap. She could smell the lust drug on Shen Xing’s body, but she had sealed her acupuncture points with a silver needle after she left!

As time passed, the numbing effect of her acupoints began to wear off.. The lust drug was about to take effect.
