The president smiled at Qiao Nian. He admired Qiao Nian more and more.

The president smiled and nodded. “Alright, we’ll go over now.”

The president and Gu Zhou chatted as they walked. Lina kept holding Qiao Nian’s arm, a gentle smile on her face.

Qiao Nian glanced around. The hall was glorious. There were also exquisite paintings engraved on the walls with gold foil sprinkled on them.

The surrounding pillars were all carved from top-grade white jade. Even the beaded curtains not far away were made of crystal.

After walking around the hall, everyone walked towards the backyard from the corridor at the side.

There were countless expensive flowers in the palace. If these flowers were placed in the outside world, they would cause a commotion.

After walking around the garden, Qiao Nian saw an antique oriental building. The oriental building looked incompatible with the entire palace.

Before she could approach the eastern building, Qiao Nian could smell the agarwood fragrance wafting out of it.

A trace of surprise flashed in her eyes. Agarwood was rare to begin with, but the president had actually built an eastern building. It was obvious that the president really loved his oriental wife.

The roof of the building was golden in color, and the doors and windows were filled with carved dragons and phoenixes. The ground was covered in white jade stone sculptures, and the entire house was expensive.

However, the door of the palace was tightly shut, as if the person in the room did not want to come out.

Qiao Nian recalled what Lina had once said. Madam President seemed to have some symptoms of cerebral palsy.

At this moment, someone hurriedly walked out of the house. When he walked up to the president, he said anxiously, “President, something’s wrong. Madam has a relapse again.”

The man was none other than Dr. Ollie, who had once operated on Lina.

When the president heard Dr. Ollie’s words, his expression changed and his voice turned cold. “Wasn’t she fine when I first left the house? Why did her illness suddenly flare up?”

Lina grabbed Qiao Nian’s arm nervously, frowning. She seemed to have thought of something and turned to look at Qiao Nian. In a low voice, she said, “My mother’s illness will flare up occasionally.”

Qiao Nian nodded slightly.

Dr. Ollie panted heavily and said solemnly, “I heard from the maid who’s taking care of Madam that Madam was still asking about the Seventh Princess’s condition before her relapse.”

The President’s eyes turned cold as a ferocious glint flashed across his eyes. He glanced at the butler beside him and said, “Thoroughly investigate who leaked the news. At the same time, get rid of all the people who can’t be trusted!”

“Yes!” The butler replied and turned to leave.

He looked nervous. His Madam had never recovered from her illness. Fortunately, Dr. Ollie had temporarily stabilized her condition, so they could live an easy life for a while.

The president tried hard to remain calm. If something hadn’t happened to Lina, his wife probably wouldn’t have fallen ill.

His mind was filled with thoughts of his wife. He walked into the room anxiously, completely ignoring Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian.

Seeing this, Dr. Ollie hurriedly followed and said in a low voice, “The situation is urgent now. I suggest we inject a tranquilizer first to calm her down. We’ll talk about the rest slowly.”

The president did not speak, but his footsteps quickened.

Lina looked worriedly in the direction the president had left. There was no color in her face as she bit her lower lip.

Previously, Dr. Ollie had said that if Mom’s illness wasn’t very serious, she should not be sedated.

However, Dr. Ollie had just suggested giving her mother a tranquilizer, which meant that her mother’s condition was very critical.

Qiao Nian sensed Lina’s worry and comforted her softly. “Don’t worry, I’m here to treat Madam.”

When Lina heard Qiao Nian’s voice, her expression froze. Her gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face, and she recalled how she was lying on the bed when she was poisoned.

At that time, she knew very well that without the antidote, she would die.
