When they arrived at the living room, Qiao Nian took out a box from her bag and handed it to Matriarch Gu. Smiling, she said, “Grandma, this is the Moon Goddess. Here you go!”

Matriarch Gu looked at Qiao Nian’s bright face, her heart filled with gratitude. She took the box from Qiao Nian but didn’t open it immediately. Instead, she placed it on the coffee table.

Matriarch Gu grabbed Qiao Nian’s hand and said sincerely, “Nian Nian, thank you so much for this!”

When Qiao Nian heard this, she hurriedly shook her head. She pursed her lips and said, “Grandma, although everyone says that the Moon Goddess can sense if their loved ones are still alive in this world, and whether they will be happy after reincarnation, this is just a legend. I hope Grandma won’t have too much hope!”

When Matriarch Gu heard Qiao Nian’s words, she nodded. A trace of melancholy appeared in her eyes, and she sighed helplessly. Only then did she say earnestly, “How can I not know what you’re saying? I just want a memory!”

At this point, Matriarch Gu smiled. “Now that I have it, no matter what the outcome is, I’ll let go of my obsession.”

That smile carried a trace of paleness and loneliness.

Gu Zhou walked in. When he saw this, he frowned.

His gaze fell on the box on the coffee table. His eyes were dim, and he couldn’t come back to his senses for a long time.

He didn’t know if he should tell Grandma and Brother the truth.

However, if Grandma had any hope in this matter and if he was wrong, Grandma would suffer the pain of losing a loved one for the second time. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

At the thought of this, Gu Zhou remained silent.

Matriarch Gu glanced at the time and asked with a smile, “It’s probably time for lunch. Do the two of you want to eat? Or do you want to rest first?”

Qiao Nian turned back to look at Gu Zhou and saw that he was frowning. Sensing the change in his expression, she suddenly recalled something.

Previously, she had heard from Chen Qing about Gu Zhou’s past. However, she was very curious about the relationship between Gu Zhou and his eldest brother, Gu Yue.

Qiao Nian shook her head gently and said with a smile, “Grandma, we’ve already eaten before we came back. Why don’t Gu Zhou and I rest first?”

Matriarch Gu smiled and nodded.

Qiao Nian picked up the box containing the Moon Goddess from the coffee table and handed it to Matriarch Gu. With a serious expression, she said, “Grandma, just drip a drop of blood on it!”

Matriarch Gu’s hand trembled involuntarily as she held the box.

Then, she pretended to be calm and nodded, clenching the box in her hand. Her gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face and she said, “Alright, I understand. You and Gu Zhou should go to bed early!”

“Yes.”

Qiao Nian nodded. Her gaze swept over the box in Matriarch Gu’s hand. There was a trace of emotion in her eyes, but it quickly disappeared.

She did not stay in the living room for long. Instead, she went up to the second floor with Gu Zhou, leaving the rest of the time to Matriarch Gu.

Actually, when she obtained the Moon Goddess, she had also been tempted.

She also wanted to see the child she had never seen in this world after he was born.

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian’s eyes grew heavy.

Qiao Nian swallowed. Although she knew very well that the Moon Goddess was just a gem and couldn’t be so magical, she couldn’t help but yearn for it.

She wondered if her dead child had reincarnated. She wondered how his next life would be.

Would he have parents who doted on him? Would there be a warm home in the future?
