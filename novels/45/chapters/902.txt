903 Don’t Deal With Everything On Your Own

“If Mom only uses the blood of the broken arm for a DNA test, she can indeed determine that it’s my arm. But if she uses the epidermal cells of those broken arms for a DNA test, the results will definitely have nothing to do with me! She accepted my bone marrow. Her blood is the same as mine, but her DNA in other places is still different from mine!” Qiao Nian explained concisely.

Lu Zhu was also a smart person. He quickly understood what Qiao Nian meant. “If Mom used epidermal cells for a DNA test back then and found out that it was your arm, it means that the person who helped Mom might have tampered with Mom’s test sample.”

“That’s what I think.” Qiao Nian’s expression was serious as she continued, “If someone really tampered with the sample, it means that that person is related to the person who accepted my bone marrow. He might have been involved in my kidnapping back then.”

Lu Zhu lowered his eyes, which were filled with coldness. Soon, the kidnapping case from more than twenty years ago would appear again.

What worried Lu Zhu the most was that if someone really tampered with it, that person would definitely have a good relationship with his mother.

At the thought of a dangerous person by his mother’s side, Lu Zhu felt very uneasy.

Qiao Nian sat there and drank her drink slowly. If she hadn’t realized that Song Man wasn’t Xiao Shi and Gu Qi’s mother, the first step Song Man would have taken would have been to enter the Gu family and become Madam Gu.

If she wasn’t wrong, Song Man wanted to enter the Lu family and pretend to be the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

Qiao Nian’s grip on the cup tightened.

Those people were simply crazy.

Back then, not only had they kidnapped her, but they had also extracted her bone marrow and thrown her somewhere else.

Now, they still wanted Song Man to replace her and live a better life.

Suddenly, Qiao Nian felt that something was wrong.

She felt a chill run down her spine.

If she wasn’t wrong, those people were also the ones who had schemed against her and Gu Zhou five years ago. Only then would Song Man be able to adopt Xiao Shi naturally and enter the Gu family to be Mrs. Gu.

Those people seemed to be playing a huge game of chess.

Back then, she was only three years old when she was kidnapped. She had seen Song Man before. Song Man looked to be about her age.

This meant that Song Man did not know back then. After all, she was just a child.

There must be an adult behind this.

Why would they do that?

Qiao Nian didn’t intend to tell Lu Zhu about this. She wanted to investigate it alone and find everyone involved. She wanted them to pay with their lives.

“Brother, do you know who I’ve donated my bone marrow to?” Qiao Nian asked because she wanted to confirm that those people had kidnapped her for her bone marrow.

Lu Zhu frowned and said, “At that time, you were still so young. How could you donate bone marrow to someone else? Besides, donating bone marrow is very dangerous. How could Dad and Mom let you do such a dangerous thing?”

Qiao Nian instantly understood. Her guess was right.

However, Song Man was dead. They could investigate Song Man’s past, hoping to find clues.

Qiao Nian now understood that those people all knew that she was still alive.

“Brother, help me ask Mom first. After you know the answer, tell me,” Qiao Nian said, lowering her gaze. When she knew the answer, she would consider returning to the Lu family.

“Okay!”

Qiao Nian had chatted a lot with Lu Zhu tonight and obtained a lot of useful information. It was getting late, and Big Brother had to rest.

“Brother, it’s getting late. Go back and rest first. I have other things to do.” Qiao Nian stood up. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Lu Zhu still wanted to talk to Qiao Nian more. After all, his sister had been very busy. He didn’t have much time to see her. He frowned and asked, “It’s already so late. Aren’t you going back to rest?”

Qiao Nian nodded and smiled. “That matter is a little urgent. I have to do it now.”

Lu Zhu’s frown deepened. He instructed, “Sugar, if you need anything in the future, just tell me. I’ll definitely help you. Don’t shoulder everything yourself, understand?”
