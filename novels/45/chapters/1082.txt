1083 She Was Wrong!

Seeing Qiao Xin in such a sorry state, Qiao Yu sighed helplessly. He could no longer find Qiao Xin’s past self in her!

Qiao Xin lay on the ground with teary eyes. Recalling Qiao Nian’s words just now, she glared at her resentfully!

Why did she have to exist alongside Qiao Nian?!

Why did the heavens have to be so unfair?

Why was she always the unlucky one?

Just as Qiao Xin was about to speak, she saw two policemen and Su Xue walking over from afar.

Qiao Xin got up from the ground in a sorry state. Even if her legs were intact, it would be very difficult for her to escape the police. Moreover, her legs were injured!

Su Xue looked at the two police officers anxiously and hurriedly said, “Officers, is there a misunderstanding? Our Qiao Xin just encountered an incident. She’s a victim. She hasn’t recovered from what happened that day!”

When Su Xue was outside, she heard two police officers trying to arrest Qiao Xin. She was stunned. Qiao Xin was clearly the victim. Why were the police arresting her?

Qiao Yu looked at Qiao Xin with a complicated expression, then at the police officer walking over. He slowly lowered his gaze and couldn’t help but sigh.

He had done something wrong back then!

Six years ago, if he had educated Qiao Xin and made her stop doing such things, Qiao Nian might have let Qiao Xin off for Grandma’s sake. Moreover, the police didn’t have any evidence!

But this time, it was Qiao Xin who took the initiative to hand the evidence to the police!

Qiao Yu’s heart ached. Six years ago, because of his own selfish desires, he hadn’t been able to trust Qiao Nian or educate Qiao Xin well.

He had caused Qiao Nian to stay in the mental hospital for five years. He had also caused Qiao Xin to lose her innocence and reputation. Now, she was about to go to jail.

Without even looking at Su Xue, the two police officers walked towards Qiao Xin.

Qiao Xin’s eyes were red-rimmed. Looking at the approaching police officers, her body trembled involuntarily. She cried loudly, “I didn’t do anything. I don’t want to go to jail!”

With that, Qiao Xin instinctively wanted to escape.

However, before Qiao Xin could take a step, Qiao Yu grabbed her arm!

Qiao Xin stopped in her tracks and turned her head to look at Qiao Yu inch by inch, her face filled with fear. “Brother, what are you doing? It’s fine if you don’t help me, but why are you stopping me!”

Qiao Yu looked at Qiao Xin sadly. He knew that the consequences of resisting arrest were very serious. He spoke up to persuade her. “Qiao Xin, listen to me. Stop fooling around. Follow the police to the police station. Believe me, you won’t go to jail forever. As long as you reform yourself in there, you’ll still be able to get out!”

“Brother, are you giving up on me because of Qiao Nian?” Qiao Xin’s voice was teary.

Qiao Yu shook his head and said seriously, “I’m saying these words for your sake!”

“For my sake, you should save me!” Exasperated, Qiao Xin flung Qiao Yu’s hand away and cried loudly. “If you want me to go to jail, doesn’t that mean you want me to die?”

“You won’t be able to escape now!” Qiao Yu reminded her helplessly. “If you confess, they’ll be lenient. If you resist, they’ll punish you severely!”

“Brother, how can you be so heartless? Mom has already given up on me. Are you giving up on me now?” Qiao Xin questioned tearfully.

When Su Xue, who was standing at the side, heard Qiao Xin’s words, she froze on the spot, her heart filled with guilt.

Could it be that Qiao Xin knew everything?

How was this possible?

When Qiao Xin was in the hospital, she clearly didn’t know about that!

Su Xue’s lips trembled as she looked at Qiao Xin with teary eyes. “When… when did you know?”

Hearing Su Xue’s voice, Qiao Xin glared at her with hatred written all over her face!

Her good mother!

She had thought that she was the person her mother cared about the most, but she had never expected her mother to be heartless enough to sell her out!

For her mother, she had personally broken her father’s leg!

If her father hadn’t been abusing her mother, how could she have broken her father’s legs in such a hurry?

But what had she exchanged it for?

It was her mother’s betrayal!

Her father was still lying in the hospital with a broken leg! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Xin’s tears fell in despair. She had lost so much, but she had gained nothing.
