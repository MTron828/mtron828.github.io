1291 Sneak Attack!

At this moment, gunshots came from downstairs. The gunshots sounded like firecrackers, one after another!

“Everyone, pay attention. There’s a sneak attack!”

The people Kan Shan had brought with him began to shoot downstairs. Gu Zhou fired a shot at Kan Shan’s arms before walking downstairs.

Everyone on the stairs, who had been crippled, looked panicked, afraid that they would be killed by those people.

At this moment, Luo Tai and the others, who had rushed downstairs, saw that the firepower behind them was very fierce. They wanted to rush into the photography building, but they did not expect someone to be firing at them. They were now being attacked from both sides.

“Luo Tai, what should we do now?” someone said anxiously.

Luo Tai glanced at the useless people at the stairs on the middle first floor. He and Kan Shan were not on good terms to begin with. If Old Master Cui had not asked him to carry out the mission with Kan Shan, he would not have been willing to come.

Luo Tai frowned as he watched the people around him fall one by one. Before he could speak, they were surrounded by a group of people.

“Luo Tai, I really didn’t expect to meet you here today.” Qin Chuan slowly walked up to Luo Tai, and the mercenary in front of him made way. “You’re quite capable now!”

When Luo Tai saw Qin Chuan, his pupils dilated slightly. He hurriedly said to his brothers, “Brothers, don’t attack. This is my eldest brother!”

Qin Chuan walked up to Luo Tai and looked at him sinisterly.

Luo Tai looked into Qin Chuan’s eyes and lowered his head slightly. He said fearfully, “Brother, I’m here on a mission today. I…”

Bang!

Qin Chuan punched Luo Tai in the face, knocking out his teeth. Luo Tai fell to the ground in a sorry state, as cowardly as a mouse seeing a cat.

“How dare you touch my brother-in-law and my sister? You’re really capable!” Qin Chuan walked up to Luo Tai and stepped on the back of his hand, crushing it hard.

Luo Tai’s face was pale from the pain, but he did not dare to say a word. He looked up at Qin Chuan and said anxiously, “Brother, it’s a misunderstanding. We haven’t even entered. Kan Shan has been chasing after Gu Zhou with his men. How would we have known that Gu Zhou is your brother-in-law? If we had known, I wouldn’t have dared to attack even if I had ten heads!”

When Qin Chuan heard Luo Tai’s words, he immediately gestured for his people to rush into the film studio. “Go and save them!”

Qin Chuan and the others were still quite a distance away from the photography building. Gu Zhou was hiding in the dark, but he had never been sure who it was. However, when Gu Zhou heard Qin Chuan’s voice, he walked out from the dark.

This time, not only were Qin Chuan’s people here, but also Chen Qing. When Chen Qing saw Gu Zhou walk out, he hurriedly rushed over. When he saw the blood at the corner of Gu Zhou’s mouth, his heart jumped to his throat. He asked anxiously, “Second Young Master, are you injured?”

Gu Zhou shook his head gently and said softly, “I’m fine now. Go and call Madam down. She’s…”

When Qiao Nian saw Gu Zhou’s expression, her expression faltered slightly. She shielded Xiao Bao in her arms, not letting him see Gu Zhou’s injured expression. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“It’s good that you’re fine,” Qiao Nian said on purpose. She didn’t want Xiao Bao to worry. She led him towards a car not far away.

Gu Zhou heaved a sigh of relief, his eyes filled with smiles. He said to Chen Qing, “Kan Shan and the others are on the second floor now. They’re all Old Master Cui’s men. We can’t let them off.”

“Yes!” Chen Qing nodded and hurriedly called for everyone to run upstairs.

Chen Qing had brought a lot of people with him, so he quickly captured Kan Shan and his subordinates.

When Kan Shan and his men were brought down, their faces were pale. He looked at Luo Tai, who had already rebelled not far away, and cursed all eighteen generations of Luo Tai’s ancestors in his heart.

Kan Shan was thrown to the ground like a piece of smelly linen. He looked up and saw Gu Zhou standing in front of him in a well-tailored suit.

Gu Zhou exuded a cold aura, like the Grim Reaper from hell. It made one shiver.

There were many clouds covering the moon. The entire ground was enveloped in darkness.
