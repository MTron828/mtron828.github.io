Chapter 494: You Have Something to Say to Me

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Lu Zhu’s voice was a little hoarse as he said softly, “I’m much better now. Can you help me sit up?”

“Yes.”

Qiao Nian carefully helped Lu Zhu up and placed a pillow behind him. She looked at Lu Zhu with a complicated expression.

Qiao Nian stood helplessly at the side. She was thinking about how to talk about the matter without scaring Lu Zhu.

Just as Qiao Nian was thinking, Lu Zhu said, “You seem to have something to say to me?”

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Zhu’s words, her heart was in her throat. He had discovered this.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips and nodded. “I do have something to tell you.”

Lu Zhu looked around the ward and did not see anyone else. He asked, “Where’s Gu Zhou?”

“He just left to settle an errand. I don’t know when he’ll be back. You can let me know if you need anything.”

Just as Qiao Nian finished speaking, there was a knock on the door.

“Please come in.” Qiao Nian tilted her head.

The door opened and Doctor Sha walked in.

Doctor Sha carefully examined Lu Zhu’s injuries before heaving a sigh of relief. He nodded and said, “Mr. Lu’s wounds are healing well now. You can move them slightly, but he can’t be too agitated.”

Qiao Nian’s body stiffened slightly. Then, she nodded and said, “Okay.”

Qiao Nian knew very well that Doctor Sha’s last words were directed at her.

Lu Zhu’s wound was beside his heart. If his emotions fluctuate too much, it might affect his heart.

Therefore, she could not acknowledge Lu Zhu yet.

Seeing that Qiao Nian understood what he meant, Doctor Sha nodded and said, “Doctor Qiao, I’ll leave first. If there’s anything else, please call me again!”

“Thank you, Doctor Sha,” Qiao Nian said sincerely.

“You’re welcome.”

After Doctor Sha left, only Qiao Nian and Lu Zhu were left in the room.

Qiao Nian’s heart was racing, and her emotions were complicated.

Her own family member was right in front of her, but she couldn’t acknowledge him.

“Lu…”

“Qiao …”

They both spoke at once.

Qiao Nian was slightly taken aback. Then, she smiled and said, “You go first!”

Lu Zhu’s gaze landed on Qiao Nian’s clear eyes. Recalling what he had just said, he asked, “Did you have something to say to me just now?” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I just wanted to ask if you’ll be homesick after being away so long this time?”

Lu Zhu said calmly, “Ever since I turned 18, I haven’t thought about this matter much.”

“Is there anyone in the house you’re concerned about, then?”

Lu Zhu’s eyelashes fluttered slightly as he replied, “I’m worried about all of them.”

Qiao Nian’s eyes flickered. After hesitating for a long time, she asked tentatively, “I once embroidered a Lucky Bag for the eldest daughter of the Lu family. When the Qingming Festival comes, I’ll embroider another Lucky Bag for her!”

Before going to MY, if Qiao Nian had said these things to him, Lu Zhu would have ignored her. But after so many things happened, he wasn’t so resistant to her anymore.

“Thank you.”

Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. She wanted to know more about Lu Zhu’s feelings for the eldest daughter of the Lu family. “You want the Moon Goddess because of her, right?”

At this moment, Lu Zhu’s hair was a little messy. His eyes were extremely clear, and there seemed to be some indescribable emotions hidden in them. He looked at Qiao Nian quietly for a long time before saying, “Can you give me my glasses?”

Qiao Nian glanced at the glasses on the bedside table. She walked over and handed them to Lu Zhu.

After Lu Zhu put on his glasses, his aura changed instantly. He looked more refined and serious.

“I heard that if you drip your blood onto the Moon Goddess, you can dream of the loved ones you want to see the most. Moreover, you can determine if your loved ones are happy in their next life based on the color of the jade,” Qiao Nian said.
