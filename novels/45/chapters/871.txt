872 Biological Relationship

Chen Qing put the test report into a folder. Without looking at the results, he walked straight to Xiao Shi’s ward.

Outside the ward.

Song Man continued to accompany Xiao Shi in the ward.

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian sat on the chairs in the corridor. Gu Zhou didn’t look well.

Qiao Nian held Gu Zhou’s hand tightly and comforted him softly. “Xiao Shi is still young. Don’t scare her!”

Gu Zhou had a headache.

Seeing how dependent Xiao Shi was on Song Man, he felt that his previous plan might have been a little rash.

If he forcefully took Xiao Shi away from Song Man, she might be frightened.

Could he really only let Song Man be by Xiao Shi’s side?

Song Man was a very scheming woman. He was very sure that the woman from five years ago was not Song Man. How did Song Man chance upon Xiao Shi?

What if he found out in the future that Song Man was not the woman from five years ago and could not accept it?

He had to think of a way to take Xiao Shi away from Song Man.

“Looks like we should investigate Song Man properly!” Gu Zhou said with a dark expression.

“Yes.” Qiao Nian didn’t think about this. She was worried that Xiao Shi wouldn’t be able to accept the truth.

At this moment, footsteps came from afar.

Chen Qing walked over with a folder.

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian looked up. When they saw the folder in Chen Qing’s hand, their expressions turned serious.

Qiao Nian had already done many DNA tests on Song Man, but the results were that Song Man and Xiao Shi were mother and child.

She was nervous but looked forward to it.

She hoped that there was a mistake with the machine at her appraisal center.

If only Xiao Shi and Song Man were not mother and daughter…

Chen Qing handed the report to Gu Zhou.

“Second Young Master, the results of the appraisal are out. I didn’t read the contents.”

Gu Zhou took the document from Chen Qing and opened it. He was not a medical student and did not understand the data, so he flipped to the last page.

The results of the appraisal were that they were biologically related.

Gu Zhou frowned. He still felt that Song Man was not like the woman from five years ago, but the appraisal report showed that Song Man and Xiao Shi were related by blood.

Gu Zhou’s expression darkened. His voice was low and hoarse, with a trace of disbelief. “Is there a mistake with the appraisal results?”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s question, she knew what the results were.

She frowned slightly. Although she was unwilling to believe that Song Man was Xiao Shi’s biological mother, the truth was right in front of her. She had no choice but to believe it.

Moreover, she had done many paternity tests in the past, and there had never been any mistakes.

Qiao Nian took the report from Gu Zhou and examined it carefully. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

She wanted to see the comparison of every value.

Qiao Nian read it very carefully. This report was written very clearly and analyzed more thoroughly. She could even see the contents of the trace elements in her blood.

Qiao Nian’s gaze moved down. When she saw the percentage of white blood cells, she frowned slightly.

Strange, why was the percentage of white blood cells so high?

Not only that, but the percentage of platelet data was also very high.

Qiao Nian clenched her fists involuntarily.

She looked up at Chen Qing and asked impatiently, “Chen Qing, when Doctor Xu saw the blood report just now, did he say anything?”

“Yes.” When Chen Qing first went from the appraisal room to the small ward, his mind was filled with thoughts of protecting the documents. However, Doctor Xu’s question was thrown to the back of his mind. “At that time, he did say some strange things.”

“What?” Qiao Nian asked anxiously, wanting to confirm her suspicions.

“He asked me if the owner of the blood had any blood disease.” Chen Qing recalled what Doctor Xu had said.

When Qiao Nian heard Chen Qing’s words, her breathing quickened.

That’s right. That had to be it.

Previously, she had seen that the data on white blood cells and platelets was wrong.

Doctor Xu was a professional appraisal doctor. If he had such a question in his heart, it meant that her guess was not wrong.

Qiao Nian’s expression darkened. She said calmly, “Song Man is indeed not Xiao Shi’s mother.”
