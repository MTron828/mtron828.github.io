928 It Was Nothing

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Fourth Master’s face. For some reason, she felt that he looked so familiar. She seemed to have seen him somewhere before.

Of course, Qiao Nian wasn’t the only one who found Fourth Master familiar. When Fourth Master looked at Qiao Nian’s face, he also found her very familiar. His eyes gradually darkened.

Previously, he had found this lady familiar from afar. That feeling made him involuntarily want to help her out.

Now that he was standing in front of her, the familiar feeling grew stronger.

“It’s nothing. There’s no need to mention it. There’s no need to treat me to a meal!”

As soon as Fourth Master finished speaking, his secretary walked over and said respectfully, “Fourth Master, Eldest Young Master is almost here!”

Fourth Master nodded and said, “Xu Jian, send this lady out!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

When Xu Jian heard Fourth Master’s words, his eyes were filled with disbelief. Inch by inch, he turned his head to look at the young lady Fourth Master had mentioned.

In the past, everyone thought that Fourth Master might be a monk and did not pity any women in the mortal world.

However, he had never expected to see Fourth Master concerned about an unfamiliar woman in his lifetime!

This woman was really good-looking. She was flirtatious and cold.

Xu Jian had been by Fourth Master’s side for a long time and knew what to ask and what not to ask, so he said, “Miss, please come with me. I’ll send you out!”

“Thank you,” Qiao Nian replied and left with Xu Jian.

Fourth Master stood rooted to the ground. As he watched Qiao Nian leave, the more he looked at her back, the more he found her familiar. His frown deepened.

He seemed to have seen that back view somewhere before.

Where had she seen it before?

Fourth Master’s frown deepened. He couldn’t remember at all.

He couldn’t be bothered to think about it anymore. He turned around and walked in. Just as he reached the corner, a girl jumped out.

“Fourth Brother!”

This sweet voice made Fourth Master’s heart soften involuntarily. His lips curved up imperceptibly.

Lu Qi placed her hands behind her back and pouted. She complained unhappily, “Brother, why didn’t you go home? You haven’t been home for two years. Grandma talks about you every day!”

Fourth Master was the Fourth Young Master of the Lu family, Lu Jiang.

Lu Jiang looked at Lu Qi gently and reached out to rub her head. Lu Qi’s neat hair was ruffled by him, making it look like a chicken nest.

The smile on Lu Jiang’s face grew brighter. With a smile, he reprimanded, “Lu Qi, do you know where we are? You’re still a student. You shouldn’t be here!”

“Brother, I’m already eighteen years old. I’m qualified to come here. Look, I’ve already grown so tall. I’m already an adult. You can’t treat me like a child anymore!” Lu Qi pouted and raised her hand to tidy herself up, muttering.

“No matter how old you are, you’re still a child in front of me! Alright, follow me closely now. Don’t talk to strangers. There are many vicious people here.”

“Okay!” After Lu Qi tidied her hair, she jumped to Lu Jiang’s side.

At this moment, Xu Jian walked over from the door. He looked at Lu Jiang respectfully and said, “Fourth Master, I’ve already sent that lady to the car and she left according to what you said.”

Lu Jiang nodded slightly. The young lady’s eyes appeared in front of him.

Those beautiful fox-like eyes were unforgettable.

Lu Qi was walking behind Lu Jiang. When she heard Xu Jian’s words, her eyes lit up.

In the past, Grandma often nagged in her ear that Fourth Brother might be a monk who had no feelings for girls.

Grandma often said, “Sigh, Xiao Qi, your fourth brother might be single for the rest of his life!”

“Brother, who is the young lady Brother Xu Jian is talking about?” Lu Qi asked gossipily. If she told Grandma the good news, Grandma would definitely be overjoyed!

“Students have to study hard. Don’t care about all that nonsense!” Lu Jiang changed the topic.

“Brother, don’t change the topic.” Lu Qi snorted and smiled playfully. “You always treat me like a child, but I’ve really grown up!”

“Yes, yes, yes. Little Princess, you’ve grown up!” Lu Jiang continued perfunctorily.

“Brother, just tell me. I’m very curious!” Lu Qi looked up and pouted.
