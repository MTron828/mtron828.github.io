1115 Missed Call

“When we get to MY, tell Jiang Chi everything that happened. I think Jiang Chi knows who those people are!” Gu Zhou paused for a moment and continued, “We should also teach those people a lesson. They’re a group of heartless people!”

Qiao Nian nodded in agreement. Those people were really evil!

Gu Zhou took out his phone and called Chen Qing.

Chen Qing picked up the call very quickly. “Second Young Master!”

Gu Zhou said coldly, “Get ready. We’re going to MY.”

Chen Qing was slightly stunned. It was already nighttime. He asked with certainty, “Are we going now?”

“Yes!” Gu Zhou said with certainty.

Chen Qing immediately took out his computer to check the plane tickets.

At the Lu residence.

Lu Qi looked at the analysis Qiao Nian had sent and instantly felt enlightened.

Why hadn’t she thought of using this method?

She was still not familiar with this technique. It seemed that she had to study medicine well in the future to solve these difficult questions like her sister!

Lu Qi sorted out the answers and sent them to Mr. Jiang!

She sat in front of the computer and waited expectantly for Mr. Jiang’s answer!

In less than ten minutes, her email rang. She opened it expectantly. It was a reply from Mr. Jiang.

“Two o’clock tomorrow afternoon, Venus Cafe, Room Six!”

Lu Qi’s pupils dilated uncontrollably, and her lips curved up involuntarily. She jumped up in joy.

Oh my god, she was about to see the genius doctor, Mr. Jiang!

This was great news. She had to quickly share this good news with her sister.

Then, when Lu Qi called Qiao Nian, Qiao Nian’s cell phone rang.

Strange, had Sister gone to bed so early?

She didn’t think too much about it. She hung up in disappointment!

She glanced at the time on the computer. It was already twelve in the morning!

She had been reading her sister’s answer just now. Perhaps she was too engrossed, but time passed in the blink of an eye!

For geit! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

At this time, most people had gone to bed.

Tomorrow morning, she had to tell her sister the good news as soon as possible!

When she saw Mr. Jiang tomorrow, she had to tell him that her sister had helped her solve the last question. Mr. Jiang would probably want to compare his medical skills with her sister!

Mr. Jiang was her idol!

At the thought that she would see Mr. Jiang tomorrow, Lu Qi tossed and turned, unable to fall asleep!

Qiao Nian arrived at MY. When she walked out of the cabin, she turned on her cell phone. There was a missed call from Lu Qi.

Qiao Nian took out her phone and was about to call Lu Qi back when she inadvertently saw the time on the upper right corner of her cell phone. It was four in the morning. At this time, Lu Qi must be sleeping. She should call Lu Qi back at dawn!

Holding Qiao Nian’s hand, Gu Zhou walked out and said softly, “You must not have slept well on the plane. I’ve already asked Chen Qing to make a hotel booking. We’ll look for Jiang Chi after we catch up on our sleep!”

Qiao Nian nodded in agreement. She had indeed not slept well on the plane. Her entire body was still a little sore. Even if she and Gu Zhou went to look for Jiang Chi now, he might be sleeping too!

It was not good to disturb one’s sleep!

Chen Qing dragged his luggage over. When he saw Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian, he said tiredly, “The hotel I booked is near the airport. We’ll just walk over!”

“Have you contacted Jiang Chi’s people?” Gu Zhou asked.

“I just called Jiang Wen, but he said that Jiang Chi had already left the Ghost City at night,” Chen Qing said honestly.

Gu Zhou frowned and said worriedly, “Could Jiang Chi have already left?”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she began to worry.

Chen Qing continued, “Jiang Wen said that Jiang Chi’s phone has already been turned off. He has already sent Jiang Chi a text. Jiang Chi will definitely reply to him when he turns it on. When the time comes, Jiang Wen will tell us the situation.”

Only then did Qiao Nian nod.

An City Airport.

Although it was four in the morning, there were still many people at the airport.

At this moment, someone walked out. The man was wearing a suit and looked very gentlemanly.
