1160 Shut up!

Her pupils dilated involuntarily. She really couldn’t believe that there was a prince who didn’t despise her and was even willing to give her candy!

“Thank you, Second Brother!” She gripped the candy in her hand tightly, not willing to eat it.

It was at that moment that Second Brother was like a beam of light, illuminating her dark life. She was no longer that pitiful wretch from the orphanage.

Candy had an expiration date. She realized that the candy had already begun to melt, and the packaging of the candy had turned yellow. She took out the candy inside, washed the packaging carefully, and kept it properly.

Lu Qi was chatting and laughing with her brothers when her gaze inadvertently landed outside. She saw Song Yu standing at the door. She smiled and waved at Song Yu, shouting, “Sister Song Yu, you’re here too!!”

Lu Qi’s voice interrupted Song Yu’s thoughts. When she saw everyone looking at her, a gentle smile appeared on her face. She said with a smile, “I’m here to pass the cushions to my brothers!”

As Song Yu spoke, she glanced at Lu Nian.

Song Yu stood at the door with the cushion in her arms. After a moment’s hesitation, she walked in. “I think I’m too late. Do they no longer need the cushions?”

“How can that be?” Lu Qi hurriedly took Song Yu’s arm with a mischievous smile. “Sister and I just happened to miss out on a portion!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

When Song Yu heard Lu Qi’s words, a trace of surprise flashed in her eyes.

Lu Qi had a good relationship with Song Yu and quickly understood the meaning in Song Yu’s eyes. She smiled and said, “Sister and I delivered the cushions to my brothers. Mom must know. We should just kneel here and be punished together. That way, Mom won’t be angry with us!”

Song Yu naturally understood that her sisters were kneeling.

“I’ll kneel with you,” Song Yu said with a smile.

Lu Qi nodded.

“Eldest Brother, Second Brother, Third Brother, Fourth Brother, and Sister.” Song Yu smiled gently, her gaze lingering on Lu Nian’s face for a while.

“You just finished work on the production team and went to the award ceremony to win the Best Actress award. You should be happy today. Don’t be punished with us.” Lu Zhu looked at Song Yu gently and advised.

Song Yu was a little hesitant. She didn’t know if her brother really felt sorry for her, or if he wanted to send her away so that the siblings could talk nicely.

Song Yu was about to refuse when she heard Lu Zhu say, “Lu Qi, you’re fooling around too. How can you let Nian Nian come here? Don’t you know that your sister still has to go to the hospital tomorrow to investigate what happened back then? Alright, the three of you young ladies should go back to sleep!”

Song Yu felt a little guilty. She had never been so sensitive in the past. Now, she was wondering every moment if her family was sincerely good to her.

Her father cared about her.

Her mother cared about her too.

Big Brother was also concerned about her!

It seemed that after Song Xue appeared, she began to feel uneasy, worried that she would be chased out by her family.

At this moment, Auntie Cao walked in.

When Auntie Cao saw Lu Qi, she frowned and her voice became stern. She questioned, “Little Miss, what are you doing here? Why aren’t you sleeping?”

“Auntie Cao, I just want to come over and accompany my brothers!”

Auntie Cao glanced at everyone and frowned. She shouted sternly, “This is simply too much. The ancestral hall is not a place for you to fool around casually. The four young masters are being punished in the ancestral hall. Three young ladies, please go back and rest. If Madam gets angry, I’m afraid you won’t have a good time!”

Lu Qi didn’t agree with Auntie Cao. She frowned and said, “We didn’t do anything.”

“Shut up!” Auntie Cao berated unhappily.

The gentleness in Lu Zhu’s eyes instantly disappeared, and his eyes turned cold.

The eyes of the others turned cold.

Auntie Cao didn’t notice their gazes. She looked at Qiao Nian coldly, her tone filled with dissatisfaction. “Ever since Fifth Miss returned, this family has been in a mess!”
