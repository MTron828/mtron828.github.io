1189 Give Up

The first time Qiao Nian saw Allen was in the hotel. Fourth Brother had asked Allen to send her off.

Thank you readers!

She smiled at Allen and nodded in greeting.

Allen’s gaze fell on Lu Jiang’s face and he said respectfully, “Fourth Master, Mr. Chen’s assistant replied after receiving the invitation. He said that he would see you tomorrow night!”

Gu Zhou walked over to Qiao Nian and put his arm around her waist. “The stone gambling banquet will be held tomorrow night?”

“Yes, it seems that he really likes stone gambling,” Lu Jiang said thoughtfully.

From their words, Qiao Nian was certain that the stone gambling competition would be held tomorrow night. Mr. Chen would also appear. She just didn’t know what clues Mr. Chen had.

The entrance of the hotel was not a place to talk. Everyone walked in from here.

Gu Zhou kept his arm around Qiao Nian’s waist. The last time he came here, he had been sneaky. This time, he could come with Qiao Nian openly.

Qiao Nian sized up the decorations around her. They were no different from the last time she had been here.

However, she felt that something had changed. When she noticed Gu Zhou’s hand around her waist, she realized that he was warm.

The last time she came here, her relationship with Gu Zhou was very cold.

But this time, they both had each other in their hearts.

Lu Jiang took the room card from Allen and handed it to Gu Zhou. “I’ve already booked a room for you. Rest well today. We’ll meet Mr. Chen tomorrow. I’ll handle the rest.”

“Okay!” Gu Zhou replied. He turned to speak to Qiao Nian in a low voice.

Lu Jiang handed the other room card to Jiang Chi, who had been silent. “Yours!”

Jiang Chi reached out to take the room card, but Lu Jiang did not let go. He raised his eyebrows and looked at Lu Jiang.

“I already know about An City.” Seeing that Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian didn’t notice them, Lu Jiang stopped in his tracks, his eyes instantly turning cold. “If you really want to help Sugar, I’ll be grateful. However, if you have other thoughts about her, don’t blame me for being impolite!”

Jiang Chi met Lu Jiang’s eyes fearlessly, and his thin lips curved up slightly. “I didn’t expect you to be able to tell that I had other thoughts about her. Your judgment isn’t bad!” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Lu Jiang’s eyes grew colder and colder. His entire body emitted a cold aura, as if he was the Grim Reaper from hell.

If Jiang Chi said anything else treasonous, he would definitely swing the Death God Scythe in his hand and take his life!

Lu Jiang looked into Jiang Chi’s eyes carefully, as if he was confirming if Jiang Chi was telling the truth.

Jiang Chi’s gaze was firm. He didn’t seem to be lying.

Lu Jiang let go, his face filled with pride. His Sugar was naturally the best. The coldness in his eyes dissipated a little. “I hope you’re telling the truth.”

Seeing Jiang Chi take the room card, Lu Jiang’s expression changed slightly. He looked at Jiang Chi warningly. “As Sugar’s biological brother, I’ll give you a friendly reminder. You’d better give up as soon as possible, because Gu Zhou is more suitable for her and the two of them are already connected. No matter what you do, it’ll be in vain.”

Lu Jiang had been paying attention to the relationship between Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian. He realized that Gu Zhou really doted on Qiao Nian, so he could only accept him.

Jiang Chi stood rooted to the ground, his eyes lighting up. His lips curved up imperceptibly as he looked at Qiao Nian’s back not far away.

Lu Jiang had already said what he needed to say. He strode away.

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian entered the elevator. It was already full. Jiang Chi could only wait for the next elevator.

The elevator door slowly closed. He noticed Qiao Nian looking at Gu Zhou with a gentle gaze and a bright smile.

When the elevator closed completely, the smile on Jiang Chi’s face instantly disappeared, leaving only burning anger.

…

In the room.

The moment Qiao Nian entered the room, she changed out of her high heels and sat down on the sofa in her slippers, leaning back lazily.
