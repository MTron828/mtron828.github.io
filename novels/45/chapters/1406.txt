1407 Don’t Be Agitated

Uncle Zhao was stunned.

“Old Master was so angry that he made him spend the rest of his life in prison just to avenge you. Have you really gone senile? Have you forgotten all of this?” Matriarch Lu looked at Uncle Zhao with a dark expression. She yearned to throw Uncle Zhao out, but when she thought of how Uncle Zhao had stayed in the Lu family for so many years, her heart couldn’t help but soften.

When Auntie Cao, who was standing at the side, heard Matriarch Lu’s words, she nodded tearfully and said softly, “Old Zhao, I was there too. The chauffeur had just drunk too much. At that time, I was the one who helped you carry your wife out of the car. Don’t you remember?”

Uncle Zhao looked at Matriarch Lu in disbelief, his gaze finally landing on Auntie Cao’s face.

There was already a deviation in his current memories. He didn’t know which memory to believe at all, but the only thing he was sure of was that Auntie Cao wouldn’t lie to him. At that time, he and Auntie Cao were both servants of the Lu family and had no benefits.

In other words, the memories he had just recalled were all real?

Uncle Zhao’s gaze fell on Matriarch Lu again. Her eyes were filled with tears, and his body was trembling slightly.

What was going on?

Why couldn’t he remember how well Old Master and Matriarch Gu had treated him previously?

Why was his mind filled with voices asking him to ruin the Lu family?

What exactly was going on?

Seeing that Uncle Zhao’s expression wasn’t good, Qiao Nian trembled all over. She hurriedly said, “Uncle Zhao, don’t be agitated. I know why you have two different memories.”

Uncle Zhao looked at Qiao Nian in confusion. He took a deep breath and tried his best to remain calm. His eyes were red as he looked at Qiao Nian and asked, “Miss, I-I don’t know what’s going on. I have two completely opposite memories in my mind. What’s wrong with me?”

“You’re hypnotized. Can you think about it carefully? Is there anyone who frequently sits in front of you and tells you things?” Qiao Nian asked seriously.

Uncle Zhao shook his head and said sadly, “No, I remember. I only remember that the chauffeur who caused the accident once called me. He said… he said that the child in my wife’s stomach isn’t mine.”

Auntie Cao quickly walked up to Uncle Zhao and cried until she was out of breath. “You’ve been deceived. The driver surnamed Wei was in a car accident when he was drunk and killed your wife. You’ve always wanted to repay Master and Matriarch!”

Uncle Zhao frowned at Auntie Cao in front of him. He did not speak.

His mind was in a mess now. Two voices were fighting.

Qiao Nian looked at Uncle Zhao and said, “Uncle Zhao, if I’m not wrong, you should have been hypnotized. That person hypnotized you to attack the Lu family. As for what you said about my grandfather deliberately causing your wife’s death, we’ve also investigated it.

With that, Qiao Nian took out her phone and played a recording.

“W-Why are you here?”

When Uncle Zhao heard the voice on the phone, his eyes lit up. This voice belonged to the chauffeur, Wei Hao, who had killed his wife and children. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“I just came to see how you were doing here.”

Uncle Zhao had always been in the Lu family and was very sensitive to the voices of the people around the Lu family. This was the voice of Lu Zhu’s secretary, Allen.

Wei Hao gave a wanton smile and said mockingly, “The Lu family is actually so kind to visit me? Has the sun risen from the west?”

“I just think you’ve been in prison for a long time. If you really repent, the Lu family is willing to let you live.”

“Really?” Wei Hao’s voice was especially excited. He leaned forward and looked at Allen expectantly. “Are you saying that I can get out early?”

“Back then, you were driving drunk. Logically speaking, your time in prision is about up.” Allen shook his head helplessly, looking disappointed. “I wanted to let you out during Lixia, but you…”

“What? Why do you still say but…” Wei Hao questioned excitedly, his tone rising.

Seeing that Allen was silent, Wei Hao panicked and hurriedly said, “I want to go out. I’ve been working obediently in prison all these years. I’ve done very well!”
