When Qiao Nian heard these words, her eyes instantly filled with tears. She covered her mouth, her body trembling non-stop.

As a doctor, she knew very well that if a person was shot in the abdomen, the chance of death was as high as 90%.

Could it be that Eldest Senior Brother had come to say goodbye to her in that dream just now?

Eldest Senior Brother…

Qiao Nian was trembling all over. She stood up and subconsciously wanted to walk out.

Gu Zhou quickly grabbed Qiao Nian’s hand and looked at her worriedly. “Where are you going?”

“I’m going to look for Eldest Senior Brother. I’m going to look for him,” Qiao Nian said in a trembling voice. She had to look for Eldest Senior Brother now. She had to find him. She had to wait for him to be safe before returning.

“Do you know where he is now?” Gu Zhou asked.

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, tears welled up in her eyes.

She knew that Eldest Senior Brother was injured. All she wanted to do now was look for him, but MY was so big, and she didn’t know where Eldest Senior Brother was. Where should she look for him?

She just wanted to see Eldest Senior Brother. This wouldn’t do.

Gu Zhou gave Chen Qing a look, and Chen Qing immediately left.

Gu Zhou pulled Qiao Nian into his arms again and comforted her in a low voice. “Don’t worry, my big brother won’t let anything happen to Chang Feng.”

Qiao Nian’s heart was still in a mess. When she thought of how badly Eldest Senior Brother was injured, she wouldn’t be able to calm down for a long time.

Seeing Qiao Nian cry, Gu Zhou said with heartache, “When the time comes, we’ll ask Xiao Bao. Xiao Bao will definitely know where Chang Feng is now.”

“Okay.” Qiao Nian silently wiped her tears and glanced at the watch on her wrist.

It was already six in the morning. At eight in the morning, she would go to the hotel to look for Xiao Bao.

…

At Mr. Chen’s villa.

There were already many cigarette butts by Gu Yue’s feet. He had been waiting outside for the entire night, but the emergency room door had yet to open.

Seeing how haggard Gu Yue was, Butler Zhao said worriedly, “Sir, why don’t you go back and rest first? I’ll stay here and guard Chang Feng. When Uncle Zhang comes out, I’ll tell you immediately.”

Gu Yue did not speak. He just stood there smoking in silence.

Every time he had something to worry about, he would smoke.

Butler Zhao sighed heavily, frowning.

In the emergency room.

Uncle Zhang carefully took out the bullet from Chang Feng’s abdomen and casually threw it aside. He heaved a sigh of relief and immediately sutured Chang Feng’s abdomen nervously.

Chang Feng was seriously injured. Fortunately, the bullet in his abdomen had avoided his vital points. However, he had lost a lot of blood now. Coupled with the anesthesia he had received during the surgery, he had yet to wake up.

Chang Feng was also unconscious. He was not out of danger yet.

If Chang Feng could wake up in twenty-four hours, he should be fine.

After Uncle Zhang finished the surgery alone, he had just taken a step when he almost fell to the ground. He quickly supported himself against the wall and walked out step by step.

The emergency room door opened.

When Gu Yue heard the commotion, he immediately walked over and asked anxiously, “Uncle Zhang, how’s Chang Feng now?”

Uncle Zhang sighed and said in a low voice, “I’ve already removed the bullet from his body.”

He closed the emergency room door and looked up at Gu Yue, frowning. “He lost too much blood. If he can wake up, he should be fine. I’m just afraid…”

Uncle Zhang frowned and let out a long sigh.

“He’ll definitely wake up,” Gu Yue said firmly. “He’ll be by my side!”

Uncle Zhang also hoped that Chang Feng would wake up. He looked at Gu Yue in front of him and said expectantly, “I hope so.”

“It’s not safe here.” Gu Yue frowned. He was the one who had bought this villa for Cui Huai. The most important thing now was to send Chang Feng to a safe place. He said to Butler Zhao, “Send Chang Feng to my private villa.”

“Yes.”

Butler Zhao followed Gu Yue to send Chang Feng to the villa by the sea, followed by Uncle Zhang.

If Qiao Nian were here, she would definitely be able to recognize Uncle Zhang as Old Master Qin. He was the grandfather she and Qin Chuan had been looking for.
