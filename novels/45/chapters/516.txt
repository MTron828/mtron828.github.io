Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Lu Zhu looked at Qiao Nian lovingly. He wanted to spend more time with her, but when he saw the dark circles under Qiao Nian’s eyes, his heart ached. He hurriedly said, “Sugar, go back to the hotel and rest tonight. Chen Shi will guard me here.”

“But I—”

“Sugar, don’t refuse your brother’s kindness. We’ve already reunited. If Mom and Dad find out I didn’t take good care of you, they’ll say I treated you badly. They might even break my leg.”

Hearing Lu Zhu’s words, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but laugh. “Brother, I won’t expect you to be beaten up by Mom and Dad at your age!”

Lu Zhu smiled dotingly and said, “Alright, Sugar, listen to me now. Go and rest!”

As for what he said about being beaten up, he didn’t elaborate.

Qiao Nian didn’t want Lu Zhu to worry about her, so she nodded and said, “Alright, I’ll go back to the hotel first. Brother, I’ll come back tomorrow!”

“Yes.”

Qiao Nian covered Lu Zhu with the blanket before walking out.

Lu Zhu lay on the bed and watched Qiao Nian leave, his eyes filled with gentleness. However, when he thought about how Qiao Nian was already married, he couldn’t help but feel depressed.

He finally found Sugar, but he hadn’t spoiled her yet. Sugar was already married to someone else.

Moreover, Sugar was married to Gu Zhou.

Was it just fate?

… .

About half an hour later, Qiao Nian returned to her hotel room.

She finally acknowledged her brother now, and her heart, which had been beating wildly in her chest, relaxed.

Qiao Nian happily took a shower and was applying a facial mask when her phone suddenly rang. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The call was from Gu Zhou.

When she saw the name Gu Zhou, she was a little dazed.

Although they had only been apart for a few days, Qiao Nian felt that it had been a long time since she had contacted Gu Zhou.

Qiao Nian answered the call and placed the phone to her ear. “What’s wrong?”

The line was silent. No one answered her.

Qiao Nian frowned slightly and called out worriedly, “Gu Zhou?”

The sound of wind and heavy breathing came from the other side of the phone. This breathing was a little too fast. Qiao Nian’s expression immediately turned serious.

Could something have happened to Gu Zhou?

Qiao Nian felt increasingly uneasy. Frowning, she hurriedly asked, “Gu Zhou, what happened to you now? Why didn’t you say anything when you called? Are you still in MY?”

Qiao Nian asked a series of questions, but the other party didn’t answer at all.

Qiao Nian’s frown deepened. She bit her lip and asked tentatively, “If you don’t speak, I’ll hang up!”

“I’m fine. Can’t I call you?”

His voice was low and hoarse. It reached Qiao Nian’s ears through the microphone, making her feel that Gu Zhou’s current situation seemed to be very bad.

Was Gu Zhou injured?

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but feel nervous. She hurriedly asked, “Gu Zhou, what’s wrong?”

Qiao Nian didn’t hear Gu Zhou’s voice. She could hear his heavy breathing and the faint sound of his footsteps.

She remembered that Gu Zhou still had injuries on his back and asked worriedly, “Where is Chen Qing?”

At this moment, Gu Zhou’s voice came through the phone.

‘Why haven’t you called me?’

Qiao Nian was slightly taken aback. She had never heard Gu Zhou speak in such a voice before.

There seemed to be an unhappy tone in his voice mixed with some grievance, as if he were suppressing something.

Qiao Nian’s heart trembled slightly. For some reason, her heart ached.

“Gu Zhou, you…”

“Why do you keep thinking about Gu Zhou?”

He interrupted her without hesitation. His voice was deeper and huskier than before. He seemed sad and uneasy.
