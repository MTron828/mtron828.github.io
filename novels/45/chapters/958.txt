959 Spicy Duck Neck

Gu Zhou noticed that Qiao Nian was concerned about him. His lips curved up slightly as he said, “One bowl is enough for two to share!”

Qiao Nian was speechless.

She looked down at the porridge in her hand. There wasn’t much porridge.

Just now, she had thought that Gu Zhou was very careful and gentle with her, but she realized that he was petty.

!!

How much was this bowl of porridge? Two people eating one bowl!

What was going on!

The car drove forward and finally stopped at Boss Li’s spicy duck neck store.

Boss Li had been busy in the shop. When he heard the car stop at the door, he looked up and his eyes lit up.

Boss Li hurriedly walked out.

At this moment, Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian both got out of the car.

Boss Li looked at Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian excitedly, his eyes sparkling. He said excitedly, “Mr. Gu, I really didn’t expect you to come. This is my honor!”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned.

When had Boss Li and Gu Zhou become so familiar?

She looked at Boss Li. Boss Li had an excited gaze. The way Boss Li looked at Gu Zhou was not like he was looking at a guest at all. It was as if he was looking at his savior.

However, Qiao Nian didn’t have time to think too much about it. Her mind was filled with the smell of spicy duck neck. She couldn’t help but drool.

Gu Zhou looked at Boss Li, his expression as calm as ever. His tone was gentle as he said, “I’m here specially to bring my wife to eat your spicy duck neck!”

Gu Zhou’s voice was as calm as ever. His gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face, and there was a hint of doting in his eyes, as if he only had eyes for Qiao Nian.

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, her heart skipped a beat. A warm current flowed through her body, and she felt much better.

In the past, she had a secret marriage with Gu Zhou, so when they were outside, they were a doctor and a patient.

This was the first time Gu Zhou had told anyone that they were husband and wife.

Boss Li’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face, his eyes filled with gratitude. “Mrs. Gu, thank you so much!”

When Qiao Nian heard Boss Li’s words, she was a little stunned. She had no idea what was going on.

She was just here to buy spicy duck neck. Why should the boss thank her?

However, before Qiao Nian could think clearly, Gu Zhou coughed. Boss Li instantly reacted. He smiled at Qiao Nian and asked gently, “Mrs. Gu, how many catties of duck neck do you want this time?”

“A catty,” Qiao Nian replied with a smile.

“Alright, please wait a moment!”

With that, Boss Li walked in energetically and weighed three catties of duck neck. Only then did he put the duck neck into the box and put it in the bag before taking it out for Qiao Nian.

If it weren’t for the fact that he had to make sure the duck neck was fresh and delicious, he would have prepared more than ten catties.

He handed the bag to Qiao Nian. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

When Qiao Nian took it, she was slightly stunned. Smiling, she said, “This is a little too much. I can’t eat it all.”

When Boss Li smiled, he revealed his white teeth and said, “It’s fine. You can put it in the fridge. As long as you can finish it tomorrow!”

Qiao Nian smiled and was about to scan the QR code to pay when she heard Boss Li say, “Mrs. Gu, you don’t have to pay for this!”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. Puzzled, she asked, “That won’t do. We still have to pay.”

“In order to repay our old customers, our shop doesn’t require them to pay.” Boss Li finally found an excuse and said with a smile.

“There’s no need. You have a small business. We should pay up. Otherwise, you’ll lose too much money!” Qiao Nian insisted on scanning the QR code to pay.

Boss Li looked at Gu Zhou helplessly, not knowing what to say.

Gu Zhou nodded.

Seeing Gu Zhou nod, Boss Li heaved a sigh of relief and said, “Thank you.”

Qiao Nian paused for a moment. For some reason, she felt that Boss Li was a little strange today. He was too polite.

Moreover, when did Boss Li become so close to Gu Zhou? He kept looking for Gu Zhou’s affirmation.

However, she couldn’t ask Gu Zhou directly now, so she got into the car and left with him.

After driving for about a hundred meters, Qiao Nian hurriedly covered her stomach with her hand. She looked at Gu Zhou pitifully and said, “Stop the car. My stomach isn’t feeling well.”
