1418 Immortal Match

Qiao Nian still remembered that she had just reunited with her eldest brother. She had followed Gu Zhou and her eldest brother back to An City from MY. At the airport, Third Brother had come to pick up her eldest brother. There were also rows of luxury cars and bodyguards. At that time, it had made the headlines.

She also knew in her heart that it was true that the Lu family was rich. The Lu family’s strength in Europe could not be underestimated, but the fact that the person behind them could reach into the Lu family in An City meant that that person was not simple.

Fourth Brother was so high-profile because he wanted to give those people to establish an advantageous position for oneself. He wanted those people to understand that the Lu family was not so easy to bully!

When the Europeans passing by saw such a big ceremony, they took out their phones and began to take photos. They couldn’t help but gossip.

“Could this be the new Earl and Madam?”

“I think so. They probably want to take the opportunity to show their faces in front of the European public.”

“I really didn’t expect this to be an Asian man. He’s really close to his Madam. The two of them have been holding hands the entire time.”

“They’re simply a match made in heaven.”

…

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian walked up to the luxury car. He let go of Qiao Nian’s hand and gently wrapped his arm around her waist, protecting her in his arms. He glanced around sharply. Seeing that there was no danger around, he followed Qiao Nian into the car.

Chen Qing stood in the back seat. Seeing the bodyguard signal him to take another car, he nodded slightly.

This was the first time he had seen such a commotion at the airport. His usual style was too low-profile.

Previously, he had heard from Second Young Master that the richest person in An City was the Fourth Young Master of the Lu family, Lu Jiang.

As Lu Jiang liked to gamble on stones, he spent most of his time outside, so no one in An City knew about him.

The man in the front passenger seat turned to look at Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou, who were sitting in the middle. He said very respectfully, but neither servile nor overbearing, “Eldest Miss and son-in-law, I’m Fourth Master’s personal assistant, Su Han. I’m now your assistant. The two of you have just arrived in Europe. Why don’t you go to the Water Sky Villa to rest first?”

Qiao Nian looked at Su Han and smiled. “Thank you for your trouble.”

“If you have any instructions, feel free to let me know.” Su Han gave a faint smile.

Qiao Nian nodded and retracted her attention. Looking at Su Han’s clothes and his generous manner, she could tell that he was a well-known person in Europe.

Qiao Nian knew that the Water Sky Villa was the most luxurious villa cluster in Europe. Those who could live in this villa area were either rich or noble. It was said that even the current president of Europe lived there.

Gu Zhou sent a message to Chen Qing. Chen Qing, who was sitting in the back car, received a message to “retreat” and immediately understood.

He had been by Gu Zhou’s side for so many years and had long developed a tacit understanding.

Actually, he had already arranged for someone to pick him up, but he did not expect the Fourth Young Master of the Lu family to send someone to pick him up.

His people did not need to appear on the surface. This trip to Europe was very dangerous. His people could guard them in the dark.

Chen Qing took out his phone and lowered his head to send a message to his men. “Retreat. Protect them in the dark!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

After sending the message, Chen Qing closed his eyes and leaned back in the car to rest. Now, he had to seize all the time to rest, because they might be too busy to sleep after that.

When the luxury cars arrived at the Water Sky Villa area, many families heard the commotion and leaned out to take a look. When they saw the convoy head for the middle villa, they sighed.

The people who lived in the Water Sky Villa were either rich or noble. Everyone was in the same circle and more or less knew each other. However, they did not know who stayed in the villa in the middle. They heard that it was a banker.

However, that banker seemed to be very busy. He was usually not here, and others seemed to have always called him “Fourth Master”.

When Qiao Nian stepped into the villa, she looked in front of her and was in a daze. She felt as if she had returned to the Lu family villa in An City.

This was because the decoration here was exactly the same as the Lu family’s in An City.

At this moment, Qiao Nian’s phone rang. As soon as the call went through, she smiled and called out, “Fourth Brother!”

“You’re home now, right?” Lu Jiang’s voice was filled with endless doting.

When Qiao Nian heard his voice, she felt as if she was basking in the winter sun. It was warm and comfortable.

She looked at the decorations and smiled. She nodded and said, “Yes, we’re home!”
