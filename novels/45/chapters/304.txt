Chapter 305: Public Execution

Gao Lin, Xia Xue, and Liu Yu also rushed over.

Actually, Xia Xue hadn’t wanted to come, but Liu Yu had said that she could see Qiao Nian’s reputation ruined today. She couldn’t help but rush over to watch the show.

Gao Lin stood at the side with her arms crossed. She said disdainfully, “How embarrassing. There’s no one here, and you’re still soloing. I’m sure you’re playing the violin desperately to please the rich!”

Xia Xue felt a flash of pleasure, but her expression was gentle as she spoke. “Lin Lin, don’t say that. There might be a misunderstanding.”

When Liu Yu heard Xia Xue’s words, she said coldly, “How can there be a misunderstanding? Moreover, I just heard from the director that such a person with a loose private life will definitely have a negative impact on the school. The school will definitely punish her severely.”

When the other onlookers heard Liu Yu’s words, they nodded in agreement and pointed fingers at Qiao Nian.

Seeing that Qiao Nian didn’t even bat an eyelid, Gao Lin felt as if her fist had landed on cotton. She was furious. When she thought of how she had been slapped twice in the morning for no reason, she yearned to go forward and slap Qiao Nian back.

However, she was no match for Qiao Nian. She could only scold her even more harshly. “You’re just a prostitute. Everything about you has been exposed, and your indecent photos are everywhere. Even if you sit here with your clothes on, we can still imagine your dirty naked body.”

“I don’t know where you get your courage to sit here. If I were you, I would have found a place to hide long ago. I would never embarrass myself here.”

Just as Gao Lin finished speaking, a female voice suddenly sounded from the school’s radio, which should have been playing music.

“Sister Xia Xue, what exactly is going on?”

This voice…

Gao Lin’s face froze, and her eyelids twitched violently. For some reason, she began to panic.

Xia Xue and Liu Yu looked at each other and then at Gao Lin.

Everyone looked surprised. They didn’t understand why the radio no longer played music.

The radio was silent for a long time. The sound of their breathing could be heard faintly.

About five minutes later, Gao Lin’s voice rang out again on the radio. “Sister Xia Xue, I think Qiao Nian is playing the song ‘Missing You’ on purpose today. I think she came prepared. Is she here because of your status as Mr. Hua’s female musician? Why haven’t you spoken? Are you going to give this position to Qiao Nian?”

“Sister Xia Xue, only you are qualified to be Mr. Dong Hua’s female musician. The day after tomorrow is Mr. Dong Hua’s concert. Before that, don’t screw up!”

After a long time, Xia Xue finally spoke.

“This… this matter is a little complicated. I don’t know what to say…” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Hearing Xia Xue’s words, all the students in the school pricked up their ears. They seemed to have smelled the scent of a conspiracy.

When Xia Xue heard this, her face turned pale in fear. She couldn’t help but tremble.

How… how could this be…

Gao Lin was dumbfounded. Her mind was in a mess. She didn’t know why this had happened.

Gao Lin looked toward Qiao Nian and saw her standing under a tree. Her expression was languid, and her lips were curved up slightly, as if everything was within her expectations.

Gao Lin seemed to have thought of something. She hurriedly glanced at the time. Twenty minutes had passed since Qiao Nian had threatened her.

Could Qiao Nian be telling the truth?
