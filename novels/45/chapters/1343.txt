1344 Threat

At eight o’clock in the evening, at An City’s film studio.

The director sat in the studio, staring at the monitor in front of him. He nodded at the staff.

The staff immediately shouted, “Cut!”

When Song Yu, who was wearing a white ancient outfit, heard the staff member’s voice, she immediately wiped the tears off her face and gave everyone a bright smile. “Thank you for your hard work.”

Song Yu smiled and thanked the others. She walked up to the director and sat down naturally beside him. She asked, “Director Li, is my filming alright this time? Is there anything I need to improve?”

Director Li looked at Song Yu and smiled in satisfaction. “Xiao Yu, you filmed very well this time. There’s nothing to improve on. There might be a night scene tomorrow. Go back and rest early today.”

“Alright, thank you for your hard work, Director. I’ll go back first.” Song Yu gave a gentle smile and went to the dressing room to remove her makeup before bringing her manager back to her nanny van.

Song Yu casually took her bag from the side of the car, opened it, and looked through her phone. She realized that there were thirty missed calls. The caller ID was “Xue”.

Song Yu’s pupils trembled slightly, but she quickly regained her composure.

When they arrived at the hotel, Song Yu asked her manager to buy food and called Song Xue alone.

Song Xue picked up the call very quickly.

“Sister.” Song Xue’s tone sounded sinister. “Why did you call me so late?”

Song Yu maintained a fake smile on her face, and her voice was as gentle as ever. “Xiao Xue, I’ve been filming recently and am a little busy. I haven’t brought my cell phone with me. What’s wrong?”

“Qiao Nian is back. Find an opportunity to take the three children out of the Gu family villa or their school. You don’t have to do the rest.”

Song Xue’s voice sounded cold, as if she was giving an order.

Song Yu gripped her cell phone tightly. Some time ago, Qiao Nian had gone to MY, but Song Xue hadn’t come to look for her. Today, she had seen in the group chat that her brothers had said that Qiao Nian had returned to the country. She didn’t expect Song Xue to receive the news so quickly.

What exactly did the person behind Song Xue want to do?

“I’m afraid that won’t do.” Song Yu pretended to be in a difficult position and said sadly, “Our current production team doesn’t allow us to leave the house. I’m afraid we won’t be able to leave for the next three months.”

“That’s not something I care about. A week. I’ll only give you a week. If you can’t bring those three children out, I’ll expose your identity. You’ll never be able to return to the Lu family again.”

With that, Song Xue hung up. Song Yu didn’t even have time to speak.

When Song Yu heard the beeping sound from the phone, her eyes were filled with complicated emotions.

After some hesitation, Song Yu called Qiao Nian.

At the Gu family villa.

Qiao Nian was telling a story to the three children when she heard her phone ring. She glanced at the number, and a trace of confusion flashed in her eyes.

Song Yu had actually called her?

Qiao Nian let the three children read their own sketchbooks. She walked out of the door, not forgetting to close it behind her.

She picked up the call and heard Song Yu’s gentle voice. “Sister, what are you doing now? Are you busy?”

“Yes, I’m taking care of the children.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Sister, you’re back from MY. Do you want to have dinner another day?” As Song Yu spoke, her eyes changed a few times. She paused for a moment. “Just the two of us.”

Song Yu gripped her cell phone tightly, her heart in a mess. She didn’t know if Qiao Nian would agree to her invitation. After all, the two of them weren’t close enough to have a meal together.

Qiao Nian felt that Song Yu was a little strange, but she still agreed. The two of them agreed to have lunch together tomorrow.

After hanging up, Qiao Nian received the location of the meal from Song Yu.

The next morning, Qiao Nian brought the three children to school and even helped Xiao Bao settle the admission procedures. The three children were the same age and joined the same class.

As noon approached, Qiao Nian drove straight to the Rose Hotel near the film studio complex where Song Yu was.

When Qiao Nian entered the private room, Song Yu was already inside.

“Sister, please sit.” Seeing Qiao Nian enter, Song Yu hurriedly stood up and greeted her.
