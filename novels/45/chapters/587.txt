Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

This was Matriarch Gu’s obsession. She had always wanted the eldest young master of the Gu family to return. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Qiao Nian pursed her lips and silently put the photo away. She looked out at the fallen leaves, her heart filled with sorrow.

She knew that Matriarch Gu was suffering from a mental illness. Sometimes, a mental illness requires medicine.

Suddenly, Zhou Zhou and Gu Chuan’s faces flashed in Qiao Nian’s mind. Gu Zhou must have suffered a huge blow to have two personalities!

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Matriarch Gu’s face. After some hesitation, she asked, “Grandma, how’s Gu Zhou’s relationship with Eldest Brother?”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Matriarch Gu couldn’t help but smile. It was as if she had returned to the time when Gu Zhou and Gu Cheng were together.

“The two of them are very close.”

“Ah Zhou respects Ah Cheng very much. Ah Cheng also dotes on Ah Zhou very much. He will give Ah Zhou the best.”

“In the past, when Ah Zhou was naughty, it was Ah Cheng who protected him!”

“The two of them will study together, watch television together, and sometimes play Lego together!”

… .

As Matriarch Gu spoke, her eyes gradually dimmed. She frowned and pursed her lips, no longer speaking.

Qiao Nian was a little surprised by the relationship between Gu Zhou and Gu Cheng. If the two of them were really that close, Gu Zhou would probably mention Gu Cheng often!

But Gu Zhou had never mentioned Gu Cheng.

However, looking at Matriarch Gu’s current state, there should be some unhappiness between Gu Cheng and Gu Zhou.

“Does Gu Zhou like Big Brother?” Qiao Nian asked tentatively.

Matriarch Gu’s expression relaxed. Smiling, she said, “When Ah Zhou was young, he liked his eldest brother very much. Moreover, the two of them were very humble. They would always leave the best things for each other.”

Qiao Nian smiled and nodded. It seemed that they had only gotten into an argument after they grew up. Moreover, Matriarch Gu’s next words confirmed her guess.

“They were raised separately since they were young. Ah Zhou was sent to the countryside, and gradually, he became less and less talkative. It’s all his incompetent parents’ fault!” When Matriarch Gu said this, her tone was a little unfriendly.

Qiao Nian frowned. The Gu family was a huge family. Even twenty years ago, the Gu family was still a famous family in An City. Why would the Gu family send Gu Zhou to the countryside?

Gu Zhou was not in good health. Shouldn’t he be taken care of at all times?

Speaking of which, she had been married to Gu Zhou for so long, but she had never seen his parents.

Could it be that Gu Zhou’s parents didn’t like him?

In that case, it was possible.

When Qiao Nian thought about how Gu Zhou had two personalities in his body, she couldn’t help but feel sorry for him. Perhaps there were more than two personalities in his body, but she had never seen any other personalities.

How sad and painful must a person be? How many times had he experienced despair to give birth to other personalities?

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but voice her confusion. “Grandma, why was Ah Zhou sent to the countryside? There are so many rooms in the Gu family villa.”

When Matriarch Gu heard Qiao Nian’s question, her eyes instantly turned red. Her chest felt a little tight, and she took a few deep breaths. When she regained her composure, her voice was a little choked up. “It’s all Bai Hui’s fault. This is simply a sin!”

Qiao Nian’s eyes were filled with shock.

Before she married Gu Zhou, she had asked around about the Gu family. Bai Hui was Gu Zhou’s mother.

When Bai Hui was young, she was the number one socialite in the country. Her beauty was still well known until now. No socialite in the country today was more popular than Bai Hui!

Matriarch Gu was usually gentle, kind, and generous. She never spoke ill of anyone.

Why was Matriarch Gu angry when she mentioned Bai Hui?

Seeing that Matriarch Gu’s breathing was rapid, Qiao Nian was afraid that she would be unable to catch her breath. She hurriedly smoothed Matriarch Gu’s back and said gently, “Grandma, don’t be angry. You have to take good care of your health now.”
