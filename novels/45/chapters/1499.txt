1500 Not Hard

The president’s face was pale, and his eyes were filled with anger. He was the president of Europe, but his weakness was a blade of grass.

He was rich, but for the sake of the country, he did not dare to use money easily.

Although Annie’s mockery was ugly, it was the truth.

The President lowered his gaze slightly, hiding the helplessness in his eyes.

Qiao Nian was a good doctor. At her age, her medical skills were outstanding. She was already a genius among geniuses.

Qiao Nian had devoted all her energy to her medical skills. How could she have the time to cultivate such a precious plant like Falling Autumn Grass?

The president couldn’t help but sigh in his heart. It seemed that he had to rely on the Falling Autumn Grass from Annie’s family after all.

Qiao Nian looked at Annie as if she was looking at a fool. She said casually, “It’s just Falling Autumn Grass. It’s not difficult to cultivate it.”

Qiao Nian’s words were light, as if she was talking about something very simple.

The air instantly suffocated.

When Annie heard Qiao Nian’s words, her pupils dilated uncontrollably. She stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian’s beautiful face. Seeing that Qiao Nian wasn’t joking, she had a bad feeling.

When Annie was in the castle, she had seen cultivators cultivate Falling Autumn Grass. The process of cultivating Falling Autumn Grass was very complicated, and the conditions were very harsh.

How could someone like Qiao Nian cultivate Falling Autumn Grass?

The experts in their castle who cultivated Falling Autumn Grass were all over fifty years old.

Qiao Nian met Annie’s gaze fearlessly, her expression calm.

Annie stared at Qiao Nian’s face and quickly relaxed. This woman probably didn’t know the value of the Falling Autumn Grass, much less the method to cultivate it. That was why she said that fearlessly.

Annie laughed. Fortunately, she had met an idiot. She could use this opportunity to make a fuss in the future.

She was determined to get that man.

With this thought in mind, Annie’s gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face not far away. She saw Gu Zhou’s deep eyes looking at Qiao Nian affectionately.

Annie’s heart seemed to break in an instant. She bit her lip.

She was a high and mighty princess. That woman was just an idiot. Why would this man look at that woman?

Annie retracted her gaze angrily and her gaze fell on the president’s face. She said firmly, “Uncle, you know that I have a bad temper and don’t have much patience. I only hope that this man can send me back to the castle now. If you agree to my request, I’ll still send the Falling Autumn Grass over on time in the future. Otherwise, there won’t be any more Falling Autumn Grass in our castle. I won’t be able to send it to you again. Uncle, I advise you to think carefully.”

When Qiao Nian heard the President’s words, she had a gentle smile on her face. She looked up at the President and asked softly, “Mr. President, facts speak louder than words. The cultivation method of Falling Autumn Grass isn’t that difficult. If you’re willing to believe me, you can give me the Falling Autumn Grass. Three days later, I’ll return two pots of Falling Autumn Grass to you. In the future, I’ll teach your people the cultivation method of Falling Autumn Grass. At that time, Madam’s Falling Autumn Grass will be settled!”

Qiao Nian’s words exploded in the president’s mind like a bomb.

The President’s hand that was holding the Falling Autumn Grass trembled slightly. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Could Qiao Nian really cultivate Autumnfall Grass?

If Qiao Nian could cultivate the Falling Autumn Grass, he could get his own people to learn how to cultivate it from Qiao Nian. In the future, he would no longer be controlled by others.

The president stared unblinkingly into Qiao Nian’s eyes. Qiao Nian’s eyes were filled with sincerity, making him want to believe her.

Previously, when Lina was poisoned, Dr. Ollie was helpless about it. It took her ten hours to make the antidote.

The President gripped the plate of Falling Autumn Grass harder and harder. The veins on the back of his hand bulged ferociously, and his knuckles turned white.
