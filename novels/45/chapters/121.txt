Chapter 122 How Disgusting

Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

“Qiao Nian must be so angry that she can’t speak!”

“When I saw her previously, I thought she was a smart and generous young lady. I didn’t expect her to be so vicious!”

“Such a vicious person should go to the eighteenth level of hell!”

Hearing everyone’s words, Qiao Xin bit her lip and put on a selfless facade, saying, “Uncle Song, it’s all my fault. I lied to you. This Suranne Grass… This Suranne Grass was planted by my sister.”

Seeing Qiao Xin’s air of conceding defeat, Song Hua gently patted Qiao Xin’s back and said sympathetically, “Good child, you can’t always compromise. Don’t be sad. Uncle will stand up for you!”

With that, Song Hua’s gaze fell on Director Lin’s face. A trace of a smile appeared on his serious face. “Director Lin, long time no see. I apologize for coming uninvited.”

Song Hua and Director Lin used to be schoolmates.

“Since you’re already here, what’s the use of saying all this now? You’re just being a hindrance!” Director Lin knew that Song Hua was a despicable person, so he didn’t bother treating him with hospitality either.

Song Hua’s skin was thicker than a city wall. He didn’t take Director Lin’s displeasure to heart at all. His gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. “Qiao Nian, one has to have principles. As an older sister, how can you always steal

what belongs to your younger sister? You’ll never have a foothold in the medical field if you continue being like this. If you’re willing to apologize to Qiao Xin now, then I’ll let bygones be bygones for what you’ve done in

the past.”

“Stealing someone else’s fruits of labor without putting in any effort. Song Hua, you’re right!” Director Lin seemed to be implying something.

Song Hua completely ignored Director Lin’s words. No one else present right now could compare to him, especially regarding his status in the medical field. Many in the crowd would still need to fawn over him to get

where they wanted to be.

“Qiao Nian, apologize to your sister!” Song Hua shouted sternly.

“Mr. Song, what your’re saying is a little strange. Just because you said that she planted the Suranne Grass, does that mean that she must have been the one who planted it? Are you God? I must have missed the memo.”

Qiao Nian’s expression was one of utter calmness. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

When the people around them heard Qiao Nian’s words, they turned red with anger.

“Qiao Nian, do you know who he is?”

“Qiao Nian, how you fight with your sister is none of our business. But now, you’re slandering Mr. Song. Have you lost your mind?”

Qiao Nian stood there and watched as these people pointed fingers at her, each preaching morals at her. Her lips curved up in disdain. “It’s just a stalk of Suranne Grass. Surely it’ll be fine if you can’t get it back!”

“Qiao Nian is really a lunatic. A stalk of Suranne Grass is worth tens of millions!”

“If she’s not crazy, how could she not know how valuable Suranne Grass is?”

“Alright, let’s all leave. Qiao Nian must be trying to attract attention and steal her sister’s credit!”

“Qiao Nian is so disgusting!”

At this moment, Director Lin’s assistant stumbled into the room, panting heavily. “Director Lin, Miss Qiao Nian’s gift has arrived!”

When the people around them heard the assistant’s words, they all began to laugh.

“A gift that can make Director Lin’s assistant panic. Qiao Nian’s gift must be really unique!”

“Did Qiao Nian send over a bucket of shit?”

“Who knows? That might be true!”

When Director Lin heard the words of the people around him, his expression darkened. His gaze fell on the assistant’s face. “Why are you panicking? What haven’t you seen before?”

The assistant looked aggrieved. He asked carefully, “Then… then, should I get the gifts to be moved in now?”

“Do so!” Director Lin knew very well that no matter how bad Qiao Nian’s present was, it wouldn’t be as bad as others made it out to be.

The assistant nodded and walked out.

The onlookers looked at Qiao Nian with interest, waiting to laugh at her.

Song Hua looked at Qiao Nian arrogantly and said calmly, “I have a photograph of Qiao Xin cultivating the Suranne Grass here.”

With that, Song Hua unlocked his phone and pulled up a photograph, handing his phone to everyone.

In the photograph, Qiao Xin was happily holding a small flower pot. A green shoot had sprouted from the pot. Needless to say, this must be Suranne Grass..
