The surrounding onlookers could tell from his tone that he did not take the Gao family seriously at all. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Gao Hong looked at Ah Rao angrily.

This good-looking man should be her bedmate obediently. Why did he hit her father?

Gao Hong’s gaze landed on the crippled Gao Quan.

Ever since she was young, her father had been an invincible god of war in her eyes.

But now, he had been beaten to such a state by her own “plaything.”

Gao Hong was really indignant. She glared at Ah Rao. In the future, when Ah Rao entered her room and became her subordinate, she would make him kneel and apologize to her father.

“Just you wait. I’ll definitely find someone to deal with you in the future!”

“Don’t!” Gao Quan tilted his head to look at Gao Hong. He was in so much pain that it was difficult to breathe. He said with a trembling voice, “Quickly send me to the hospital!”

When Gao Hong heard Gao Quan’s words, her tears fell uncontrollably. She cried and asked, “Aren’t you going to take revenge?”

Gao Quan frowned, worried that Gao Hong would not listen to him. There was a hint of anger in his voice. “Listen to me now!”

No matter how unhappy Gao Hong was, she could only listen to Gao Quan obediently and nod.

Gao Quan heaved a sigh of relief.

......

Gao Quan’s gaze landed on Ah Rao’s face. This man looked frivolous, but he had a noble aura and did not look like an ordinary person at all.

Gao Quan recalled Wang Chuan’s fear of Ah Rao and understood that this man was not someone he could afford to offend.

This time, it was a lesson learned.

In the end, Gao Quan couldn’t help but faint!

“Dad!” Gao Hong screamed.

After a while, Gao Quan’s subordinates all came over. When they saw that Gao Quan had already fainted, they were all stunned. Without a word, they carried him and slipped away.

Gao Hong was not in the mood to bother with Ah Rao now, so she left with Gao Quan.

Ah Rao took out a tissue and slowly wiped his hands clean. “It’s getting late. I’m a little hungry!”

Qiao Nian glanced at the time. It was already half past twelve. It was indeed time to eat.

Qiao Nian followed Ah Rao towards the dining room. With such a powerful bodyguard by her side, she felt extremely safe.

“Ah Rao, when you have time in the future, can you teach me a thing or two?”

Ah Rao’s thin lips curled up slightly as he nodded and said, “It’s my honor to be able to teach you!”

When Qiao Nian heard this, her eyes relaxed, and she looked extremely beautiful.

Ah You looked a little dazed.

When he first saw Qiao Nian, he had a very good impression of her, especially when she smiled. He seemed to have seen her somewhere before.

Not far away, Qiao Yu’s eyes darkened and his breathing deepened when he saw Qiao Nian smiling at Ah Rao.

In his memory, Qiao Nian rarely smiled like this, much less to him.

The girl he had been waiting for had finally grown up. Her personality had also changed, and she was completely out of his control.

Perhaps he shouldn’t have given her freedom in the first place. Instead, he should have forced her to stay by his side.

Qiao Yu left with a dark expression.

Lu Zhu frowned slightly. He hadn’t expected Ah Rao to get along so well with Qiao Nian.

When they arrived at the dining room, Qiao Nian thought about bringing food for Fu Hang. Instead of eating with Ah Rao, she packed it and brought it back.

Ah Rao watched as Qiao Nian left.

“Brother.” Ah Rao turned to look at Lu Zhu and asked, “Can I woo her?”

Ah Rao’s voice was as playful as ever, making it impossible to tell if he was telling the truth or not.

Lu Zhu’s expression instantly darkened. “No!”

Lu Zhu didn’t tell Ah Rao the exact reason. Although Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian were secretly married, he had already promised Gu Zhou that he would keep this matter a secret. Therefore, he couldn’t tell his younger brother.
