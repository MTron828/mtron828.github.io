Chapter 378: Rage

A meaningful smile appeared on Jiang Yue’s face. She nodded and said, “I understand. Thank you.”

After the girl left, Jiang Yueli put the tea box into her handbag.

Two more products were auctioned off on the stage. Jiang Yue looked around and locked her gaze on Qin Lu.

Her grip on her bag tightened involuntarily. When she thought of everything that was about to happen, a trace of joy flashed in her eyes.

Jiang Yue walked towards Qin Lu. She had just taken two steps when she saw Qiao Nian returning from the balcony. She stopped and pretended to be attracted by the exhibits on stage.

After taking a breather, Qiao Nian felt much more comfortable. The auction on stage continued in an orderly manner. Her heart, which had been in her throat, gradually relaxed.

When the money from the charity auction arrived, she would discuss with Qin Chuan about how to build a school for the children in the poor mountains. This would also allow more children to receive an education.

Qiao Nian stood at the side, watching the auction intently.

Seeing that Qiao Nian didn’t notice her, Jiang Yue walked towards Qin Lu without a trace.

The auction went very smoothly. Qiao Nian also won a pair of sapphire earrings.

Before long, a girl in work clothes ran towards her anxiously. “Miss Qiao, something’s wrong. Second Master isn’t feeling well. He’s in the second lounge on the right on the second floor.”

Qiao Nian’s first reaction was that Gu Zhou was acting up again.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on the waiter’s face. “Where’s Chen Qing?”

......

Usually, Chen Qing would be the one to look for her.

“He’s guarding Second Young Master now. He can’t leave, so he asked me to come over.”

“Okay.”

Qiao Nian nodded and walked towards the second floor.

She recalled that when she first arrived, Gu Zhou had said that he had a headache. Now, he was saying that he was not feeling well. Could it be that Gu Zhou had already changed into Zhou Zhou due to this illness?

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian had a bad feeling. She quickened her pace.

When she reached the door of the room on the second floor, Qiao Nian placed her hand on the handle. She was about to push the door open and enter when she suddenly felt someone staring at her.

Qiao Nian’s hand, which was holding the door handle, froze for a moment. The uneasiness in her heart gradually intensified. It was very dangerous behind this door.

From the corner of her eye, Qiao Nian glanced around. Not far away, at a corner, she saw a pink dress.

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze and thought for a while. Soon, she recalled the owner of this gown. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Sure.

Since she wanted to play, she would let her have her fill.

Qiao Nian’s lips curved up in a savage smile. She quickly walked towards the corner.

The person hiding at the corner seemed to have heard Qiao Nian’s footsteps. She tugged at her skirt, preparing to leave.

Qiao Nian quickly walked to the corner. Indeed, she saw Qin Lu’s panicked face.

Qin Lu took a deep breath and quickly recovered. A sweet smile appeared on her face. “Miss Qiao, what a coincidence to meet you here. Are you also here to rest?”

With that, Qin Lu turned to leave.

Want to leave?

No way!

Qiao Nian quickly stepped forward, took out the silver needle in her hand, and inserted it into Qin Lu’s body without hesitation.

Qin Lu had wanted to escape, but her entire body was suddenly restrained, and he could not move.

Strange, why wasn’t her body listening to her?

A cold feeling wreaked havoc all over her body. Qin Lu had a bad feeling. Then, her vision darkened and she lost consciousness.

Qiao Nian looked at Qin Lu, who had fallen to the ground. A cold glint flashed in her eyes. She took out her phone and called Qin Chuan.

“What’s wrong?”

Pursing her lips, Qiao Nian suppressed her anger and said, “In two minutes, I want the waiter who looked for me in the hall.”

When Qin Chuan heard Qiao Nian’s words, he was slightly stunned. This was the first time he felt that Qiao Nian was angry.
