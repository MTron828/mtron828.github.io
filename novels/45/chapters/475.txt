Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

It seemed that Gu Zhou didn’t know about the relationship between Qiao Nian and Lu Zhu.

Xu Qian frowned as she watched Gu Zhou feed Qiao Nian glucose. Her temples throbbed.

No matter how one looked at it, Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian seemed to have an extraordinary relationship.

Earlier, she had heard from her colleague that Lu Zhu had been shot in order to protect Qiao Nian.

It seemed that Qiao Nian had an extraordinary relationship with Lu Zhu and Gu Zhou.

These two men must be chasing Qiao Nian!

Today, Xu Qian imagined a love triangle with no fear of death.

Xu Qian looked enviously at Qiao Nian, who was being pursued by two outstanding men. When would she be able to find such an outstanding man?

“Cough, cough!”

Xu Qian’s thoughts were interrupted by a cough.

Seeing that Qiao Nian had woken up, Li Na was worried that Qiao Nian would expose herself. She hurriedly patted Qiao Nian’s back and said kindly, “Doctor Qiao, fortunately, you’re awake. I just said that drawing 500 milliliters of blood is not good for your health. Look, you fainted!”

Qiao Nian panted heavily and looked up at Li Na. She hadn’t expected this nurse to be so smart.

Qiao Nian weakly massaged her temples. There was still an indescribable masculine smell at the tip of her nose. For a moment, she couldn’t help but recall that night five years ago.

The man smelled like that, too.

Qiao Nian turned around and saw Gu Zhou sitting beside her. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Qiao Nian pursed her lips slightly and silently moved away from Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou smelled good, but every time, she would think of that night five years ago.

Sometimes, she couldn’t help but suspect that Gu Zhou was the man from five years ago.

But every time she came back to her senses, she could not help but laugh at herself.

Although she did not see what the man looked like, she was completely sure that the man’s voice was completely different from Gu Zhou’s.

It would not be fair to Gu Zhou if she determined he was guilty based on his smell alone.

If Gu Zhou’s smell was similar to that of the man from five years ago, then Mr. Chen also had this smell. Moreover, Mr. Chen’s voice was a little like that man’s. However, on careful thought, Mr. Chen’s voice was still a little different from that man’s.

Gu Zhou looked down at Qiao Nian and asked worriedly, “Are you still feeling unwell?”

Qiao Nian shook her head gently. “I’m much better now.”

With that, Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Xu Qian and Li Na. With a look of concern, she asked, “How’s Lu Zhu?”

Xu Qian was the head nurse. She had just examined Lu Zhu’s body and was more qualified to speak now. “This surgery went very smoothly. Moreover, the doctor also said that Mr. Lu is temporarily out of danger. However, he still needs to be observed for another 24 hours. If Mr. Lu doesn’t suffer from major bleeding, then he’ll be fine. For the next period of time, he just needs to recuperate well.”

When Qiao Nian heard Xu Qian’s words, she heaved a sigh of relief. She was still a little worried as she looked at the tightly shut door of the operating theater. She was very worried that there would be other emergencies.

Xu Qian seemed to understand Qiao Nian’s worry. She said gently, “Miss Qiao, you don’t have to worry. The doctor is cleaning up Mr. Lu’s blood. You can arrange for Mr. Lu to be hospitalized now.”

Hearing Xu Qian’s words, Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief.

Gu Zhou glanced at Chen Qing.

Chen Qing immediately understood what Gu Zhou meant and quickly said, “I’ll go and settle the hospitalization procedures now.”

Li Na felt guilty at the thought that she had lied before. She had wanted to leave for a long time. “I’ll take you to settle the hospitalization procedures!” she said quickly.

When Chen Qing heard Li Na say this, he said very politely, “Thank you.”

Li Na smiled. “Just doing my job.”
