Chapter 379: Enraged

“I’m in the lounge on the second floor. Tie her up and send her over.”

With that, Qiao Nian hung up without waiting for Qin Chuan to speak.

Qiao Nian hesitated for a moment before walking back to the lounge the waiter had mentioned.

When Qiao Nian pushed the door open, she saw Li Kun lying on the sofa, his face flushed red. His eyes were glazed over, and he was breathing heavily.

As expected.

Qiao Nian quickly walked over and gently shook Li Kun’s shoulder. “Li Kun?”

She wondered if Li Kun was still conscious. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Li Kun was filled with anxiety. He vaguely heard a gentle and familiar voice, and smelled a faint fragrance. In a daze, he opened his eyes. When he saw Qiao Nian’s face, he thought he was dreaming.

“Miss… Miss Qiao…”

Li Kun’s voice was hoarse. He couldn’t help but want to hold Qiao Nian back. He wanted to get closer to the person he liked.

“Don’t move yet. Someone is plotting against me.” Qiao Nian pushed Li Kun back down and took out a silver needle from her handbag, inserting it into Li Kun’s hand.

Due to the pain, Li Kun’s mind was much clearer. When he thought of what had just happened, a trace of anger flashed across his face. He clenched his fists tightly.

Seeing that Li Kun had woken up, Qiao Nian hurriedly asked, “Did you eat anything else just now?”

......

Li Kun pondered for a moment. His gaze fell on the teacup in the lounge and he said hoarsely, “Tea.”

Qiao Nian followed Li Kun’s gaze. She picked up the teacup and sniffed it. Apart from the fragrance of the tea leaves, there was also a special smell.

If Qiao Nian wasn’t wrong, there should be an aphrodisiac in this cup of tea.

Sedatives could easily make one indulge in lust and arouse all the desires in one’s body.

“Who gave it to you?”

Li Kun’s mouth was a little dry. He pursed his lips and said, “Qin Lu.”

A trace of anger flashed in Qiao Nian’s beautiful fox-like eyes.

She was right.

It was Qin Lu.

Qiao Nian could naturally understand how uncomfortable it was to be drugged. Her gaze fell on Li Kun’s face. The veins on Li Kun’s forehead and temples bulged ferociously, and his entire face turned red. It seemed that she had to help Li Kun get the antidote as soon as possible.

Qiao Nian said, “The aphrodisiac in the teacup is still acting up. Come with me to the room next door.”

“Okay.”

Qiao Nian helped Li Kun up. When they arrived at the next room, she began to perform acupuncture on Li Kun. Sweat gradually broke out on her forehead.

…

Gu Zhou came out of the bathroom and led Chen Qing towards the auction hall.

After returning to the hall, Gu Zhou looked around but didn’t see Qiao Nian.

Gu Zhou frowned slightly.

Sensing Gu Zhou’s strange expression, Chen Qing asked carefully, “Second Young Master, are you looking for Young Madam?”

Gu Zhou responded indifferently.

“Before we went to the bathroom just now, Second Young Madam seemed to have returned from the balcony, but there was no sign of her in the hall. Why don’t I call Second Young Madam now?”

At this moment, Jiang Yue walked over from the side. With a quiet smile on her face, she said, “Brother Ah Zhou, Grandma just called and asked when we were planning to return home.”

Gu Zhou did not answer Jiang Yue. His gaze fell on Chen Qing’s face and he instructed, “Chen Qing, go find her. We’ll go back together.”

Jiang Yue looked at Gu Zhou in confusion and asked, “Brother Ah Zhou, are you looking for Second Sister-in-law?”

Gu Zhou looked at Jiang Yue. He did not shake his head and his expression was calm.

Jiang Yue lowered her gaze, a trace of worry flashing in her eyes. She said, “Just now, I think a waiter came to look for her. She rushed upstairs. At that time, I thought she was going to look for Brother Ah Zhou. Since Second Sister-in-law hasn’t returned yet, did she encounter some trouble?”
