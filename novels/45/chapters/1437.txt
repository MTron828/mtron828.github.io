1438 Good Morning Kiss

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he raised his eyebrows slightly. “Have you forgotten something?”

Qiao Nian frowned slightly, her eyes filled with confusion. Then, she seemed to have thought of something. Her eyes lit up as she smiled and said, “By the way, please get the kitchen staff to prepare breakfast for me!”

“What else?”

“What else?” Qiao Nian really couldn’t remember. Thinking that Lina had already packed up and was coming this way, she hurriedly said, “If I forget anything, remind me.”

“Where’s the morning kiss?” Gu Zhou asked with a serious expression.

Qiao Nian was speechless.

Why hadn’t she known that they usually had morning kisses?

However, Qiao Nian quickly understood. When she was with Gu Zhou, Gu Zhou would kiss her every morning.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou’s serious expression. After some hesitation, she took the initiative to move closer to him.

Although they had already done many things together, at the thought of taking the initiative to kiss Gu Zhou good morning, Qiao Nian’s ears still turned red.

In the end, she planted a light kiss on Gu Zhou’s lips and fled.

Gu Zhou watched as Qiao Nian ran into the bathroom. His lips curved up slightly.

Chen Qing, who was downstairs, had already received Gu Zhou’s instructions. He hurriedly walked towards the entrance of the villa. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

When Chen Qing walked to the entrance of the villa, he saw a low-profile and luxurious black car parked there.

Chen Qing still remembered Gu Zhou saying that the person who came to look for Second Young Madam today was the Seventh Princess of Europe.

At the thought that he had accidentally bumped into the Seventh Princess last night, he couldn’t help but feel awkward. His heart ached.

Chen Qing took a deep breath and walked to the car window as usual. He knocked on it.

Lina rolled down the car window. When she saw that the person outside was Chen Qing, she was slightly stunned.

She still remembered that she had been knocked down last night. When she went out this morning, her uncle’s sister had even mocked her because of this.

With a polite smile on his face, Chen Qing said elegantly and politely, “Seventh Princess, our Second Young Madam might need to tidy up. Why don’t you come in and sit for a while?”

When Lina heard Chen Qing’s words, she nodded slightly and said to the chauffeur, “Wait outside!”

With that, Lina opened the door and was about to get out of the car.

However, Chen Qing was one step ahead of her. He had already opened the car door and gestured for her to enter.

Lina got out of the car elegantly. As she was going hiking today, Lina was wearing a tracksuit and sneakers. Her hair was tied up high, and she looked energetic.

Lina followed Chen Qing into the villa. When she walked to the living room and saw the decorations and furnishings, she was stunned.

“Oh my god, the decorations here are too beautiful!” Lina stared unblinkingly at the furnishings around her. She was the seventh princess of Europe and had grown up in Europe since she was young. She knew European culture very well.

However, Lina liked Oriental culture the most. She sat on the sofa happily.

Chen Qing poured a cup of hot water for Lina. Thinking of how he had knocked Lina down last night, he asked, “Seventh Princess, does the wound on your foot still hurt?”

Lina smiled and shook her head. “It doesn’t hurt anymore!”

Chen Qing observed Lina’s expression seriously. Seeing that she didn’t seem to be lying, the guilt in his heart dissipated a little. “That’s good.”

“Nian Nian has already reset my ankle yesterday, so my foot doesn’t hurt at all.” Lina had come to look for Qiao Nian today not only to climb the mountain with Qiao Nian, but also to inquire about Qiao Nian’s medical skills. She smiled and asked, “I remember Nian Nian calling you Chen Qing, right?”

Chen Qing nodded.

Lina smiled and said, “I’ve always liked Eastern culture. The way Nian Nian helped me reset my ankle yesterday should be unique to Chinese medicine, right? Are Nian Nian’s medical skills especially amazing?”

When Chen Qing heard Lina’s question, he raised his chin proudly and said seriously, “Second Young Madam’s medical skills are especially brilliant. She’s even better than many well-known doctors!”
