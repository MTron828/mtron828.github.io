Song Man sat there quietly, letting Xiao Shi help her wipe her tears. Her eyes were filled with Xiao Shi.

After wiping Song Man’s tears, Xiao Shi looked at the mess on the ground and said, “Mommy, there are many broken glass shards on the ground. I’ll clean them up first.”

“Yes.” Song Man pursed her lips and nodded.

Xiao Shi smiled at Song Man, then squatted on the ground and carefully picked up the broken glass shards on the ground, throwing them into the trash can at the side.

She lowered her head with disappointment in her eyes. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

She had just promised her mommy that she would not speak to Auntie Nian Nian again. As long as she thought of this, she would feel terrible.

She really liked Auntie Nian Nian.

She didn’t understand why her mommy would think that she would let Auntie Nian Nian be her mommy. After her mommy gave birth to her, she would always be her mommy’s child.

Perhaps when she grew up, she would understand what Mommy was thinking.

Xiao Shi threw all the fragments in the room into the trash can. Then, she dragged a mop to the living room and placed the other things in their original positions.

After she was done with all this, she threw the trash bag into the trash can outside the villa and walked in.

When Xiao Shi entered the villa, a man who had been hiding behind a big tree walked out. He lowered his hat and was still wearing a mask, as if he was worried that others would recognize him.

He walked over to the trash can and checked the trash bag Xiao Shi had just thrown away. When he saw the bloody glass shards, he immediately took it away.

He did it very carefully. No one noticed anything wrong with him.

When he put the trash bag in the car, he took off his mask and hat and made a call.

“Sister Nian.”

“Xiao Wang, have you got it?” A gentle and pleasant female voice came from the phone.

Qiao Nian was sitting in the car, frowning. She wanted to see what other tricks Song Man had up her sleeve.

“Yes, I’ve already gotten them all.” When Xiao Wang said this, he looked a little excited. “The things they just threw out are indeed stained with blood!”

When Qiao Nian heard Xiao Wang’s words, a trace of relief flashed across her face. The burden on her shoulders seemed to have been lifted. She leaned back in her seat and praised, “You did well!”

“Sister Nian, how did you know that there would be something bloody in the trash bag?” When Xiao Wang went to rummage through the trash can just now, he couldn’t believe what he had heard. “Sister Nian has the ability to predict the future?”

“No, I just think she might accidentally injure herself,” Qiao Nian said calmly.

In Qiao Nian’s opinion, Song Man was a scheming woman.

Song Man had been living in the slums for so many years. She shouldn’t be suicidal.

However, Song Man should be violent. That was why she felt that Song Man might accidentally hurt herself. Perhaps there would be Song Man’s blood in the trash.

Actually, she was a little worried that Song Man would attack Xiao Shig. She couldn’t bear for Xiao Shi to be beaten up, so she asked Xiao Wang to wait by the villa.

If Song Man really wanted to attack Xiao Shi, Xiao Wang could rush over to protect Xiao Shi and bring her to the Gu family.

Now, it seemed that with Song Man’s blood, she could get Song Man to undergo a DNA test!

“Sister Nian is wise!” Xiao Wang said in admiration.

“Get someone to send the DNA sample to me first. If Song Man attacks Xiao Shi, you have to protect Xiao Shi!”

“Alright, Sister Nian. I’ll definitely protect her well!”

After Qiao Nian hung up, she heaved a sigh of relief. With Xiao Wang guarding her, she didn’t have to worry about Xiao Shi being hurt.

She turned to look at Gu Qi, who was sitting in the front passenger seat. Gu Qi had already fallen asleep.

However, Gu Qi was still frowning. Clearly, he had not slept well.

She moved closer to Gu Qi and reached out to gently smooth his frown.

Perhaps because Gu Qi sensed her heartache, his frown gradually relaxed and he fell asleep peacefully.

Gu Qi’s face had already been treated with medicine she had made herself. She had wanted to bring Gu Qi back to the Gu family, but she was worried that Gu Zhou and Matriarch Gu would see the wound on his face. If this matter blew up, things would be huge.
