Chapter 549: Discussion

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian gently closed her eyes, suppressing all her emotions.

Although she hated what had happened five years ago and hated the father of that child, she really liked that child and loved him.

She had painstakingly carried him for ten months.

Every time she thought of him, she would remember the fetal movement caused by the child’s mischievousness during her pregnancy. She often took her pulse and felt the pulse of the child in her stomach. Every time this happened, her heart warmed.

Sometimes, she even thought that after this child was born, she would give all her love to him and let him live a happy life.

However, this was all in her imagination. That child had just been born when…

While Qiao Nian was thinking, she arrived at the door of the room.

She reached out and pushed open the door. The familiar smell assaulted her face, causing her lonely heart to momentarily calm down.

Gu Zhou stood behind Qiao Nian. He could sense that Qiao Nian was a little down. His gaze darkened.

He had a nagging feeling that Qiao Nian might be hiding many things in her heart. Those things were secrets that he couldn’t pry into.

She might never let him into her secret.

Gu Zhou followed Qiao Nian in and closed the door behind them. His gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face and he asked, “Do you want to take a shower first?”

Qiao Nian didn’t answer Gu Zhou immediately. Instead, she walked to the wardrobe and took out the medicine box. She turned back to look at Gu Zhou and said, “I’ll apply the medicine for you first.”

Surprise flashed in Gu Zhou’s eyes. So she still remembered his injury.

Gu Zhou didn’t reject Qiao Nian’s good intentions. He raised his hand and tugged at his tie. Then, his fingers fell on the first button, preparing to unbutton it.

Seeing Gu Zhou’s actions, Qiao Nian immediately looked away.

Although this was not the first time she had seen Gu Zhou take off his clothes, every time, she would feel her mouth go dry and her eyes burn.

When Gu Zhou took off his clothes, the passion emanating from his bones was truly irresistible.

Pursing her lips, Qiao Nian walked behind Gu Zhou, wanting to help him apply the medicine.

When she brushed past Gu Zhou, he grabbed her wrist.

His fingers exerted a little strength, and his knuckles turned white.

Qiao Nian felt the strength in Gu Zhou’s grip and panicked. Her eyelids twitched, and she grew inexplicably nervous.

The temperature of Gu Zhou’s hand grew hotter and hotter. She had a bad feeling about this. For some reason, she recalled Gu Chuan, who appeared on a stormy night.

Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou and swallowed. Puzzled, she asked, “Gu Zhou, what’s wrong? Are you feeling unwell?”

Gu Zhou’s eyes seemed to be covered in a layer of mist, making it difficult to read his emotions.

Gu Zhou slowly retracted his hand and said softly, “I have something to discuss with you.”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She was a little surprised by Gu Zhou’s attitude. This was the first time Gu Zhou had told her that he wanted to discuss something.

This matter must be very important. That was why he had to discuss it with her.

Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou and nodded. “Then tell me!” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Do you still remember Gu Qi?”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Qi’s name, she immediately placed the medicine box on the ground. She looked at Gu Zhou worriedly and asked anxiously, “What’s wrong with Gu Qi?”

“He’s sick now!”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, a sharp pain flashed in her heart, suffocating her.

“Why is he sick? What illness does he have?”

“He’s been having a cold and fever recently, but his fever hasn’t subsided.”

Qiao Nian frowned. She sized Gu Zhou up and asked, “Then how did you know about this?”

Gu Zhou could see the worry and anger in Qiao Nian’s eyes. He pursed his lips slightly and said, “Because I’m his godfather.”
