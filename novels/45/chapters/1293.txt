1294 Why?

“Xiao Bao? Can you tell Mommy what you’re thinking?” Qiao Nian planted a kiss on Xiao Bao’s forehead, her voice gentle.

“Kan Shan.” As Xiao Bao spoke, tears silently fell down his face. He said in pain, “He’s clearly my daddy’s subordinate. Why… why is he here to catch us?”

After Xiao Bao finished speaking, he shook his head vigorously. “He’s my daddy’s subordinate. He definitely has to listen to my daddy. Did my daddy ask him to catch us?”

Xiao Bao recalled hearing Kan Shan shout “Kill Gu Zhou” in his room. He said sadly, “That’s impossible. Daddy said that he and Daddy are biological brothers. Daddy definitely won’t hurt Daddy. Mommy, am I right?”

When Qiao Nian heard Xiao Bao’s words, she knew that he hadn’t noticed that Gu Zhou was injured. Smiling, she held Xiao Bao’s hand tightly and said gently, “Xiao Bao, your father will never hurt your father. Kan Shan must have come here tonight because someone else asked him to.”

Qiao Nian paused for a moment and continued, “If your Daddy knew that you were by your father’s side, why would he let so many people with guns who might hurt you arrest us? Therefore, your father definitely didn’t do this. You have to have confidence in him!”

“Is that so?” Xiao Bao pouted and asked in confusion.

Qiao Nian smiled and nodded. “Think about it this way. Kan Shan is your father’s subordinate. He might also be someone else’s subordinate. He listened to someone else’s instructions and came to arrest us.”

When Xiao Bao heard Qiao Nian’s words, his beautiful fox-like eyes were instantly filled with worry. He grabbed Qiao Nian’s hand. “Is Kan Shan a spy?”

A spy?

What had Xiao Bao learned from his brother?

He knew what a spy was at such a young age!

However, Qiao Nian still smiled and agreed. “Yes, Kan Shan is a spy.”

“Then wasn’t Daddy deceived by Kan Shan?” Xiao Bao gasped, his eyes filled with worry. “Will Daddy be hurt?”

Xiao Bao finally understood why his father had given him to him today.

Kan Shan was a spy. Did that mean that Daddy had many spies around him?

Would those spies want to harm Daddy?

No wonder Daddy had said yesterday that he was worried that he wouldn’t be able to protect him.

He didn’t want his Daddy to protect him. He wanted to protect his Daddy!

Just as Xiao Bao was thinking of returning to his Daddy’s side, he heard his mommy’s gentle comforting voice.

Xiao Bao looked up and met Qiao Nian’s bright eyes. He was slightly stunned. His mommy’s eyes were sparkling like diamonds.

“What about Dad?”

Qiao Nian’s expression hardened. “Don’t worry, Dad will be fine. Our family will be fine!”

Xiao Bao nodded obediently.

Seeing that Chen Qing had already sent Gu Zhou to the ambulance, Qiao Nian pulled Xiao Bao towards it and instructed Chen Qing, “Take Xiao Bao back first. I’ll go to the hospital!”

Chen Qing knew that Second Young Madam’s medical skills were good. With Second Young Madam around, Second Young Master should be fine. The most important thing now was to comfort Little Master.

Chen Qing bent down and picked Xiao Bao up. He instructed the bodyguards to follow Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian’s ambulance, lest anything happened midway. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He brought a small team of bodyguards and was in the same car as Xiao Bao.

The lights in the ambulance were bright.

Gu Zhou was lying on the hospital bed. His shirt had already been unbuttoned, revealing the place where he had been shot in the abdomen.

The nurse at the side was urgently helping Gu Zhou clean his wound and stop the bleeding.

Gu Zhou had fainted, but because the nurse had treated his wound, he woke up from the pain. In a daze, he opened his eyes and gasped again because of the pain in his abdomen.

He tried to regulate his breathing to ease the pain.

Qiao Nian sat at the side. Seeing Gu Zhou so weak, her heart clenched into a ball. She held Gu Zhou’s hand tightly and said softly, “I can’t give you anesthesia now. If it really hurts too much, hold my hand tightly.”

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian and shook his head gently. He pulled his hand out of Qiao Nian’s grip and subconsciously grabbed the bedsheets under him.
