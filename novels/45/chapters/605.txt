Chapter 606: Suffocation and Fear

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The Gu family and the Lu family were ranked first together. Although the Lu family was relatively active in An City, no one underestimated the Gu family.

The Gu family’s ability to do whatever they wanted was still awe-inspiring.

It was said that a family had offended the Gu family. The next day, all the information regarding this family was wiped out. Even those who knew the truth did not dare to reveal a trace of it. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The two of them walked in. Just as they entered the living room, Su Sheng felt a powerful pressure. She stopped in her tracks, not daring to move forward.

Qiao Nian looked up and saw Gu Zhou walking over from the stairs.

He was wearing a white shirt and well-tailored trousers. Step by step, he walked towards Qiao Nian.

When he walked to the middle of the living room, the sunlight shone through the window and fell on him. He was so white that he seemed to glow.

The coldness in his eyes instantly dissipated the warmth in the room.

Su Sheng glanced at the person carefully, too frightened to take a step forward.

The rumored Gu Zhou was ugly and short-lived. He looked like a demon from hell.

It seemed that rumors could not be trusted completely.

Su Sheng pursed her lips slightly. Gu Zhou looked much better than the male celebrities in the entertainment industry now, but the cold aura around him matched his aura of a demon from hell.

Su Sheng swallowed nervously. She looked at Qiao Nian in a panic. She was an intruder. If Gu Zhou wanted to settle scores with her, she could only bring Qiao Nian out.

Qiao Nian frowned slightly, staring unblinkingly at Gu Zhou. He seemed even colder than before, and his gaze seemed to have grown sharper.

Strange.

What was wrong with Gu Zhou?

Qiao Nian frowned. Sensing that he was staring at her coldly, she pretended to be calm. “Second Young Master, are you preparing to leave the house?”

As she spoke, Qiao Nian glanced around but didn’t see Chen Qing.

She had made an agreement with Gu Zhou previously. In front of outsiders, they were patients and doctors. Now that Su Sheng was here, she began to act as a doctor again.

Qiao Nian glanced at Su Sheng from the corner of her eye. Su Sheng was like a child who had done something wrong. Her hands were intertwined, and she lowered her head in silence.

At this moment, Qiao Nian saw Chen Qing walking down the stairs, his face pale. Her gaze fell on his face, as if asking what was wrong with Gu Zhou.

Chen Qing quickly walked up to Qiao Nian and glanced at Gu Zhou, who was standing in the living room, staring at Qiao Nian. He said in a low voice, “Second Young Madam, Second Young Master has become even stranger.”

Qiao Nian frowned slightly.

“After you left today, Second Young Master has been staying in the study. After he came out, he didn’t seem to recognize me. The moment he left, he asked me where Nian’er had gone. Do you think he…”

“I understand.” Qiao Nian steadied her voice.

Gu Zhou would only call her Nian’er when he was Gu Chuan.

She looked at the coldness in his eyes and felt a little flustered.

What triggered Gu Zhou? Otherwise, why would Gu Chuan come out?

“Second Young Master has been standing by the study window looking out today. He seems to be in a daze, as if he’s waiting for someone. When I spoke to him, he didn’t say a word. I was scared to death.”

“The third,” Qiao Nian said in a low voice.

Whatever she feared would happen. She was most afraid of Gu Chuan.

One had to know that Zhou Zhou could just be coaxed casually. Even Gu Zhou only needed to spoken to properly. Only Gu Chuan did not give her a chance to speak at all.

Qiao Nian took a deep breath and maintained her composure. In a low voice, she said, “Accompany Miss Su now. She’s a psychiatrist I’ve specially hired to treat Little Master. If I don’t return, don’t let her see Little Master. Wait for me to return.”

When Chen Qing heard Qiao Nian’s words, he heaved a sigh of relief. He really didn’t want to see such a terrifying Second Young Master now.

Just one look from Second Young Master was enough to make his heart stop.

Now that he could leave, Chen Qing was overjoyed.

Chen Qing walked up to Su Sheng impatiently and said, “Doctor Su, please come here. Wait a moment.”

Su Sheng wished she could leave as soon as possible. Although Gu Zhou looked like a true god and was peerlessly beautiful, the coldness emanating from this person was a little overwhelming.

After the two of them left, Qiao Nian hesitated on how to break the deadlock.

“Nian’er.”

This low and hoarse voice was magnetic, like a glass of red wine. One could not help but fall into it.

Qiao Nian’s body instantly tensed up. She recalled Gu Chuan’s warning the last time.

At this moment, Gu Zhou was like a poppy flower. He was beautiful and bewitching, making one fall into a trance.
