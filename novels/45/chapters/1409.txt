1410 Danger

“The hypnotic worm in his body isn’t as simple as we think.” Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Auntie Cao’s face. It seemed that Auntie Cao had fallen for Uncle Zhao. “The hypnotic worm in his body is a child worm. If the child worm is chased out, the mother worm will react. If the person controlling the worm discovers something wrong with the child worm and he kills the mother worm, the child worm will go crazy. Perhaps it will eat all the internal organs in Uncle Zhao’s body!”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Auntie Cao’s face instantly turned pale. The others didn’t look well either. They hadn’t expected the hypnotic worm to be so powerful!

Auntie Cao’s voice trembled as she asked hesitantly, “Then can we use a knife to cut out the Hypnotic worm in his body?”

Qiao Nian paused for a moment and continued, “The hypnotic worm is different from the worms we usually see. It has a slender tail nearly three meters long. All we can see is its head. If we dig out its head, its tail will automatically grow a new head. Now, our skills can’t determine where its tail is, so it’s even more impossible to get rid of it in one go. We can only lock Uncle Zhao up now. When the time comes, I’ll think of a way to remove the hypnotic worm from his body.”

When Auntie Cao heard Qiao Nian’s words, she looked at her gratefully. “Thank you, Miss!”

After Auntie Cao finished speaking, she looked at Matriarch Lu and said softly, “Matriarch Lu, can I visit Old Zhao now?”

Matriarch Lu waved at Auntie Cao.

“Thank you, Matriarch!” Auntie Cao wiped her tears and walked out!

At the hospital.

10:00 A.M.

Lu Qi woke up naturally. She looked at the unfamiliar environment around her. After a long time, she realized that she had encountered a tunnel collapse yesterday and was hospitalized to recuperate.

Lu Qi stretched and prepared to get out of bed to wash up. She had just taken a step when the image of her thanking Senior Brother late last night instantly surged into her mind. Her expression changed slightly, and she frowned.

Senior Brother even felt that the two of them were married.

Strange.

Why would Senior Brother say that?

Lu Qi recalled what Senior Brother had said yesterday and how Senior Brother had been hit on the head and back.

Could it be that Senior Brother had lost his memory after being hit on the head by a stone?

Realizing this, Lu Qi couldn’t be bothered to wash up anymore and walked out. Just as she reached the door of the ward, she saw Song Yu sitting on a lounge chair in the corridor.

“You’re awake!” When Song Yu saw Lu Qi, she smiled and picked up the thermos lunch box on the seat beside her. She walked towards Lu Qi and said softly, “Just in time. Come and eat!”

When Lu Qi heard Song Yu’s words, she stepped aside slightly and let Song Xue enter the ward. She stood rooted to the ground in a daze.

She wanted to ask clearly, but she was afraid that Senior Brother had really lost his memory.

At this moment, Lu Qi’s heart was in a mess.

Song Yu placed the dishes on the table and looked at Lu Qi in confusion. Puzzled, she asked, “Qi Qi, aren’t you coming over for dinner?”

“Sister Song Yu, why were you resting outside last night?” Lu Qi asked in confusion, frowning slightly.

She remembered that before she slept, she had reminded Song Yu to rest on the bed later.

Lu Qi looked at Song Yu with heartache and held her hand. “We sisters used to sleep on the same bed. Why were you so polite to me last night?”

Song Yu smiled dotingly and reached out to scratch Lu Qi’s nose. She said gently, “I was afraid I would disturb you last night, but I can’t accompany you in the hospital anymore. Take care of yourself.”

“Sister Song Yu, I’m no longer a child. I can protect myself now.” Lu Qi smiled at Song Yu, her eyes filled with stars.

Song Yu nodded. “I’ll go to the bathroom. Eat first.” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

With that, Song Yu walked towards the bathroom, leaving Lu Qi alone in the room again. She had no appetite at all, and her mind was filled with Qin Chuan’s face. After some hesitation, when she came back to her senses, she was already standing at the door of Qin Chuan’s ward.

Should she go in?
