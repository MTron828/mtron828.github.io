1016 Recognition

Qiao Nian stood between the siblings. In comparison, Matriarch Lu felt that Qiao Nian was just like her brothers. Her eyes were very similar to their mother’s.

Qiao Nian’s eyes were exactly the same as her daughter-in-law’s. They were both fox-like, but they were also a little phoenix-like.

Matriarch Lu looked at Qiao Nian’s face carefully. Qiao Nian’s nose was small, exquisite, and tall, exactly the same as her daughter-in-law’s.

However, her mouth curved up slightly like his son’s.

Matriarch Lu still remembered that there was a mole under the corner of Sugar’s right eye. That mole was not big. When she was young, she often hugged Sugar and said, “Sugar, my darling child. There’s a beauty mark under your eye. You’ll definitely be a peerless beauty in the future!”

Matriarch Lu pushed Song Yu’s hand away and walked towards Qiao Nian step by step.

Everything around her no longer seemed to matter. Qiao Nian was the only one in her eyes.

When she took a few steps forward, she saw the red mole at the corner of Qiao Nian’s eye.

Qiao Nian’s red mole was very small. From afar, it was basically impossible to see it.

When Matriarch Lu was only three steps away from Qiao Nian, she stood rooted to the ground. Her memory was instantly pulled back to more than twenty years ago.

Little Sugar asked, “Grandma, what do you mean by a beauty mark?”

Matriarch Lu said, “A beauty mark! Only a good-looking young lady would have such a beauty mark.”

Little Sugar said, “I don’t want to be a beauty.”

Matriarch Lu said, “Why doesn’t our Little Sugar want to be a beauty?”

Little Sugar said, “Beauty is a source of trouble. I want to grow up to be filial to my parents and take care of Grandma. If I become a source of trouble, I won’t be able to take good care of Grandma.”

Matriarch Lu’s eyes instantly turned red.

Qiao Nian was really Sugar!

Her Sugar!

She was still alive!

Matriarch Lu opened her mouth to call Sugar, but she was so excited that she couldn’t say a word.

Qiao Nian slowly walked up to Matriarch Lu, her eyes a little red. “Grandma.”

When she called out the word “Grandma”, Qiao Nian’s voice choked. “I’m sorry for being unfilial. I’ve made you worry!”

When Matriarch Lu heard the word “Grandma”, tears streamed down her face. In a daze, she saw the soft child again.

She hugged Qiao Nian, tears blurring her vision. Her voice trembled as she said, “Sugar, you’ve suffered for so many years.”

Matriarch Lu tightened her grip. She didn’t dare to imagine how Sugar had been living for the past twenty years.

If only she had sent someone out to look for Sugar back then. She might have brought her home long ago.

For a moment, excitement, joy, and sadness instantly surged in her heart…

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned.

All these years, you’ve suffered.

When Grandma found out that she had returned home, her first reaction was that she had suffered outside for so many years.

She still remembered the first thing Su Xue had said to her when she was brought back to the Qiao family. “Stay obediently after you get home. Don’t run out and embarrass yourself!”

To the Qiao family, her presence in the Qiao family was an embarrassment.

“Grandma.” Qiao Nian’s heart warmed. She hugged Matriarch Lu tightly. “I’m sorry for coming back late.”

“No, you’re not the one who should apologize. It’s us.” Matriarch Lu’s voice choked as she said guiltily, “If we didn’t believe you were dead back then…”

Matriarch Lu could no longer say the rest. She was unwilling to continue.

Qiao Nian gently patted Matriarch Lu’s back and said gently, “Grandma, that’s all in the past. Fortunately, our family has reunited.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

After Qiao Nian finished speaking, the other members of the Lu family looked excited.

Gu Zhou also looked at Qiao Nian happily. Qiao Nian had finally found her family. He heaved a sigh of relief.

Song Yu stood there with a complicated expression. A happy smile appeared on her lips, but it didn’t reach her eyes.

Indeed.

She was an outsider in this family.

Her brothers treated her the same way as Lu Qi, but they were very close to Qiao Nian.

Even Grandma…

Song Yu had grown up with Matriarch Lu, but this was the first time she had seen Grandma lose control of her emotions.
