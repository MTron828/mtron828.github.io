When Qin Chuan found out that she was the eldest daughter of the Lu family, he was shocked.

She still remembered Qin Chuan asking her, “How did you grow an arm?”

The rumored eldest daughter of the Lu family only had one arm when she was found.

But Qiao Nian’s arms were fine.

This proved one thing.

Qiao Nian might have grown a new arm herself.

Qiao Nian felt that there was something wrong with Qin Chuan’s brain.

Qin Chuan was sitting in the car. When he saw Qiao Nian’s message, he frowned slightly, his expression turning even more serious.

To be honest, the kidnapping of the eldest daughter of the Lu family had caused a huge commotion.

Soon, the kidnappers were found and the three of them were executed.

However, when he investigated this time, he discovered something strange.

Qin Chuan held his phone and hesitated for a long time before replying to Qiao Nian’s message. “You have to be mentally prepared for what I’m about to say next! It might subvert your understanding!”

“Yes?”

Qin Chuan thought for a moment and added, “Everyone thinks that the eldest daughter of the Lu family is missing an arm, but your arm is intact!”

“Are you trying to say that I have the ability to regrow an arm?”

Qin Chuan ignored Qiao Nian’s teasing. “I’ve found out…”

Qiao Nian was washing up. When she finished washing her face, she saw the text Qin Chuan had sent. She was stunned on the spot.

Her lips were pale as she pursed them gently. She looked at the message on her phone in disbelief!

How was this possible?

Qiao Nian rubbed her eyes and looked again. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Back then, Mrs. Lu had personally done a DNA test on the corpse.

Qiao Nian felt dizzy. It wasn’t easy for her to grab the table beside her to steady her swaying body.

No, that was absolutely impossible.

How could it be a DNA paternity test her mother had personally done for her?

That half of her arm clearly didn’t belong to her.

How could her mother detect her DNA?

Qiao Nian narrowed her eyes.

Previously, when she reunited with her brother, she felt that the only person who could tamper with the corpse was the forensic doctor. When she asked Qin Chuan to investigate this matter, she asked him to focus on the forensic doctor.

However, Qiao Nian had never expected her mother to be the one who had tested her broken limb more than twenty years ago.

It couldn’t be that her mother wanted to kill her!

That was absolutely impossible!

Everyone knew that after Mrs. Lu lost her beloved daughter, she suffered from depression and took things too hard.

Later on, Mrs. Lu gave birth to Lu Qi. From then on, Mrs. Lu’s condition gradually improved.

It was precisely because Mrs. Lu could not accept her eldest daughter’s death that she was unwilling to return to the country. She did not want to see anything related to her eldest daughter again.

Qiao Nian felt that Mrs. Lu would never kill her.

But why hadn’t Big Brother told her about this back then?

Could it be that Big Brother didn’t believe that Mommy was behind this either? In order to stop her imagination from running wild, he didn’t mention it.

Or perhaps it was because Big Brother knew that his mother had done these things and was worried that she would be sad, so he had never told her.

Qiao Nian slowly closed her eyes.

If her mother really did this, then there was no need for her to return to the Lu family at all, because the Lu family was no longer her home.

At this moment, footsteps came from the door.

Qiao Nian was like a frightened kitten. Her hair stood on end as she stared unblinkingly at the door.

Gu Zhou stood at the side, taking in the fear and unease in Qiao Nian’s eyes.

Gu Zhou frowned slightly. He looked at Qiao Nian worriedly and asked, “Why do you look so pale? Are you feeling unwell?”

As he spoke, Gu Zhou walked up to Qiao Nian and tested the temperature of her forehead with the back of his hand.

No fever!

Gu Zhou took Qiao Nian’s hand. Only then did he realize that her hand was cold, like ice cubes taken out of the freezer.

Gu Zhou placed Qiao Nian’s hand in his palm and looked at her intently. “What happened?”

Qiao Nian shook her head and said, “Nothing!”

As she spoke, Qiao Nian locked her phone screen. She was terrified and trembling slightly.

Gu Zhou frowned. Seeing Qiao Nian like this, he was silent for a moment. “If anything happens, you can tell me directly!”
