Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

However, since he had already spoken, Gu Zhou couldn’t go back on his words. He nodded, giving a faint murmur of assent.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou, overjoyed. She quickly said, “Thank you!”

In her excitement, Qiao Nian reached out to pet the snake a little too forcefully. Forgetting that she was injured, she accidentally bumped against the cage with her arm, right where she had been bitten. She inhaled sharply in pain, going pale in an instant.

Looking at Qiao Nian’s wound, the snake lowered its head pitifully and rubbed gently against her arm.

Tugging on Qiao Nian’s uninjured arm, Gu Zhou walked towards the door.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou’s side profile in confusion. “Where are you taking me?”

“To bandage your wound.”

Gu Zhou’s voice was as pleasant as ever, but beneath his words lay an undercurrent of overbearing strength. It would not be easy to disobey anything that voice commanded.

There was a flash of surprise in Qiao Nian’s eyes. Without struggling, she let Gu Zhou drag her to the bedroom.

Sunlight filtered through the window, illuminating the entire bedroom.

“sit down on the sofa first.” Gu Zhou looked at the sofa not far away. He turned to Qiao Nian and said, “T’ll get the medical kit.”

Only then did Qiao Nian remember something. Hurriedly, she said, “Don’t help me bandage my wound first. Take the medicinal bath first. I’l bandage my wound after I’ve helped you with the acupuncture. Otherwise, the wound will still need to be bandaged again after coming into contact with water.”

In the past, Gu Zhou would have hated anyone who spoke too much, But at this moment, Gu Zhou had a different impression.

Qiao Nian’s voice seemed to be able to penetrate one’s heart. Her voice left its mark on his heart.

This was something he had never felt before. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

suddenly, Gu Zhou’s breathing hitched. He felt as if someone had clutched at his chest, causing a sudden jolt of pain.

Gu Zhou had never felt this strange before.

Gu Zhou let go of Qiao Nian’s hand. His handsome face was expressionless and his voice was several shades hoarser. “Qiao Nian.”

Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat. This was the first time Gu Zhou had called her by her name in such a hoarse, arresting voice.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian and said with a serious expression, “Mrs. Gu, you’re a lady. If you’re in pain, just shout. It won’t be embarrassing!”

Qiao Nian’s eyes widened. She stared at Gu Zhou in disbelief. She hadn’t expected Gu Zhou to comfort her in such a manner.

At this moment, Qiao Nian’s heart was beating wildly. Before she could react, Gu Zhou had already poured sanitizing alcohol all over her wound.

Without any warning, he attacked.

Pain shot through her arm. Qiao Nian couldn’t help but cry out in pain.

In the next moment, Gu Zhou moved right up to her. Without hesitation, he bent down and sealed her lips with his.

“Mimph.”

As their lips touched, Qiao Nian’s cry was swallowed by Gu Zhou, leaving behind only a whimper.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in utter shock. She had not expected Gu Zhou to do this, and her mind went completely blank.

Gu Zhou had actually kissed her!

His lips were slightly sweet, and the lingering scent of Chinese medicine was present. It was intoxicating.

‘What was she thinking?

How could she be thinking about whether Gu Zhou’s lips were sweet?

He had kissed her!

Qiao Nian came back to her senses in an instant. She pushed Gu Zhou away and looked at him warily.

Qiao Nian’s pale face was now slightly red. She frowned, her expression displeased. “What are you doing!”

Gu Zhou observed the mixture of embarrassment and anger in Qiao Nian’s eyes, as well as her flustered air. A trace of amusement flashed in his eyes, but his expression and demeanor remained cold. “Does it still hurt?”

For some reason, Qiao Nian’s heart began to race. Hearing Gu Zhou’s words, a trace of confusion flashed across her face, but she quickly came back to her senses.

Gu Zhou was probably using this method to distract her.

Qiao Nian asked with a serious expression, “Are you using this method to distract me so that I don’t feel any pain?”

“What else?” Gu Zhou pulled Qiao Nian’s arm over and began bandaging her wound. “The latest research shows that kissing can relieve pain.”

Qiao Nian was speechless..
