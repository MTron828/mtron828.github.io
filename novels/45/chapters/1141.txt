Chapter 1142: You two are really fated!

When Qiao Nian heard Su Yan’s words, she was so touched that her lips trembled and her eyes turned red, but she couldn’t say a word.

Gu Zhou realized that Qiao Nian’s palms were already sweating nervously. He held Qiao Nian’s hand tightly, silently comforting her!

“Thank you for your blessing, Auntie Su!” Gu Zhou said with a smile!

When they arrived at the living room, Su Yan invited everyone to sit down. Then, she waved at Qiao Nian. “Nian Nian, come and sit here!”

When the Lu family heard Su Yan’s words, they all looked at Qiao Nian nervously!

Qiao Nian stood rooted to the ground, her heart beating faster and faster. Her heartbeat had long suppressed the voices of the people around her.

Gu Zhou pulled Qiao Nian to sit beside Su Yan!

Su Yan looked at Qiao Nian’s face gently and held her hand tightly. She was touched by the scene and said, “Actually, I have an eldest daughter. Her name is also Nian Nian, and yours is also Nian Nian. The two of you are really fated!”

Su Yan thought that if her eldest daughter was still alive, she would be about the same age as Qiao Nian now.

She looked into Qiao Nian’s eyes, as if she was looking into her eldest daughter’s eyes.

She couldn’t help but sink into her memories.

The Lu family members were shocked!

Ever since the death of the eldest daughter of the Lu family, their mother had never mentioned her in front of outsiders!

When Qiao Nian heard Su Yan’s words, her eyes couldn’t help but turn red!

She could see Su Yan’s longing for her in her eyes.

Previously, she had some doubts about her mother. She was worried that her mother had tampered with those samples. Now, she completely believed her!

Her mother would definitely not hurt her! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Someone else had hurt her!

Her mother had always loved her very much!

Qiao Nian looked at Su Yan and couldn’t help but grip her hand tightly.

Perhaps it was because of Qiao Nian’s actions that Su Yan was pulled back from her memories!

Su Yan smiled and held Qiao Nian’s hand tightly. She said uncomfortably, “I went off topic just now. Nian Nian, where are you from?”

Although Gu Zhou wasn’t her son, at this moment, when she looked at Qiao Nian, she really felt as if she was looking at her son’s wife.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips and said, “An City.”

“You’re such an obedient child. I’ve never seen you before. You’re really good-looking.” Su Yan glared fiercely at her useless sons. The disdain in her eyes was obvious.

Su Yan really didn’t understand. Her sons weren’t fools. They had always been single, yet they still said that there weren’t any good girls. Look at Nian Nian. She could tell at a glance that Nian Nian was a good girl.

“Look at the few of you. One of you is already so old, but you’re still single. Why? Do you want to die alone? You should learn from Xiao Zhou. He is marrying a wife obediently.” After Su Yan taught her good-for-nothing son a lesson, she finally added, “If you had some potential, I wouldn’t be so worried. I really don’t understand. Why is the difference between you and Xiao Zhou so great?”

Lu Zhu was shocked.

Lu Nian was speechless.

Lu Rao and Lu Jiang threw Su Yan’s words to the back of their minds and looked at each other worriedly.

They really hadn’t expected their mother to like their sister so much. If they revealed their sister’s identity, would they have to lie in the hospital in a cast for the next few days?

Seeing her four brothers’ embarrassed expressions, Qiao Nian’s lips curved up slightly. She lowered her head in silence.

With that, Su Yan retracted her gaze and looked at Qiao Nian lovingly.

Qiao Nian’s actions didn’t seem like those of a child from a poor family. She should also be from a rich family.

The Lu family was very well-known in An City. Recently, she had also searched for a few girls of the right age in An City. She wanted her useless sons to get married as soon as possible!

“Nian Nian, which family are you from? Perhaps I even know your parents!” Su Yan smiled at Qiao Nian gently.

“The Lu family,” Qiao Nian said softly, smiling at Su Yan.

Su Yan was slightly stunned. She asked, “The Lu family?”

Qiao Nian nodded seriously.

A trace of surprise flashed in Su Yan’s eyes. She looked at Gu Zhou in confusion, then at Qiao Nian. “Xiao Zhou introduced you just now.. I remember your name is Qiao Nian!”
