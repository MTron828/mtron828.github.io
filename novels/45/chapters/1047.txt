1048 Including Su Xue!

She didn’t want to leave anyone who had bullied her alive!

Including Su Xue!

When Su Xue heard Qiao Xin’s words, she was shocked. In the past, Qiao Xin had only been jealous of Qiao Nian and wanted to ruin Qiao Nian. She wanted Qiao Nian to disappear from the Qiao family and dim Qiao Nian’s light.

But now, Qiao Xin wanted Qiao Nian’s life!

!!

How much did Qiao Xin hate Qiao Nian!

If Qiao Xin knew that she had personally sent Qiao Xin to Lu Zhu, how much would she hate her.

At the thought of this, Su Xue couldn’t help but shiver.

Seeing that Su Xue was silent, Qiao Xin called out, “Mom?” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Su Xue didn’t have the guts to deal with Qiao Nian, but Qiao Xin’s condition was very unstable now. It wasn’t appropriate for her to reason with Qiao Xin directly. She could only nod in agreement and comfort Qiao Xin. “Alright, don’t worry. Mom will definitely think of a way!”

When Qiao Xin heard Su Xue’s words, she heaved a sigh of relief.

At this moment, the doctor and nurse walked over.

The doctor looked at Su Xue and said, “The surgery is ready. We have to bring the patient in for the surgery!”

“Thank you, doctor!” Su Xue nodded, her voice trembling.

The nurses pushed Qiao Xin’s bed into the operating theater. The doctor glanced at Su Xue and said, “Madam, you don’t look well. Your hair has also changed color. Do you want to go for a checkup?”

When Su Xue heard the doctor’s words, she was slightly stunned. She looked down and saw that her hair had turned white.

She must have been so angry that her hair had turned white.

Su Xue shook her head and said, “I’m fine. I’ll just wait here!”

When Qiao Xin heard Su Xue’s voice from afar, a trace of pity flashed in her eyes. Then, she slowly closed her eyes.

She would never believe anything anyone said again.

In the entire world, she was the only one who loved herself the most.

Only she could protect herself.

No one could protect her.

Qiao Xin’s mind replayed the scenes of today’s fate that was worse than death.

Although she wanted to throw this memory out of her mind as this was the most shameless image she had. She yearned to tear those people into pieces.

But thinking about it from another perspective.

Those people had made her happy before. She had never felt so excited when she was with them.

She quite liked the feeling of being photographed and introduced, as if she was the focus of the entire world.

Qiao Xin clenched her fists tightly.

Although she liked that kind of excitement, she still wanted to be her old self. She cherished her reputation very much.

But all of that was gone.

She was already trampled in the mud. What else was there to worry about?

This time, she had to make Qiao Nian die without a burial ground.

…

At this moment.

When He Cheng woke up, he realized that he had been locked in Lu Zhu’s private villa.

How strange. He had clearly returned home. Why was he back here again?

Just as He Cheng’s mind was in a mess, the door was pushed open from the outside.

It was Fourth Master standing at the door.

He Cheng’s face turned slightly pale. In the past, he had thought that Fourth Master did not give him face, but now, he did not dare to say anything in front of him. After all, he could not defeat Fourth Master.

He Cheng took two steps back and gave a flattering smile. “Fourth Master, why did you bring me here again? If you want to see me, just call and tell me!”

Seeing that Fourth Master had not spoken, He Cheng recalled the choice Fourth Master had given him previously and hurriedly said, “Fourth Master, don’t worry. I’ve already taught Qiao Xin a lesson according to what you said and ruined her innocence. You don’t have to worry anymore. Can I go home now?”

“What are you talking about? Why don’t I understand?” Lu Jiang frowned slightly and asked in confusion.

When He Cheng heard Lu Jiang’s words, his expression changed drastically. He said impatiently, “Remember? As long as I ruin Qiao Xin’s innocence, you will let me off. That’s why I specially gave her the medicine she had prepared for me. That pill was originally meant for Qiao Nian!”

When Lu Jiang heard He Cheng’s words, his expression instantly darkened. “Medicine? What medicine?”

“It’s a medicine that can make women listen to you like dogs!” He Cheng said impatiently. “Fourth Master, don’t tell me you want to go back on your word!”
