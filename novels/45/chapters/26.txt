Wang Shuo said a few more words to Teacher Liu before leaving to greet the others.

Fussing a little, Teacher Liu gave Qiao Nian a few more reminders. Finally, he said, “Study well under Doctor Wang. He is very talented in Chinese medicine.”

“Thank you, Teacher. It must have been difficult making plans for me.” Qiao Nian looked at Teacher Liu gratefully. If Teacher Liu had not gone against public opinion, she would not have been able to complete her PhD.

“Why are you being so polite? I’m your teacher. Of course I have to plan for you.” Teacher Liu really wanted to continue taking Qiao Nian under his wing, but he had already taught Qiao Nian everything he had learnt in medicine. “Alright, this matter is settled. I’ll leave first. If you need anything, look for me.”

Smiling, Qiao Nian walked Teacher Liu to the entrance of the banquet hall. She wanted to continue seeing Teacher Liu off, but Teacher Liu refused.

“You’ll be studying under Teacher Wang soon. He’ll be the one teaching you. You don’t need to send me off.” Teacher Liu smiled. He gave Qiao Nian a few more reminders, then left.

Qiao Nian turned around and entered the banquet hall. The moment she entered, she saw Wang Shuo waving at her.

Qiao Nian walked over, smiled and greeted, “Teacher Wang.” She obediently stood still.

“Su Yan, this is Qiao Nian. She’s Teacher Liu’s inner disciple. Do study well with her in the future.” Wang Shuo glanced at Su Yan with a cold expression, then he turned to Qiao Nian, a bright smile overtaking his features. “Has Teacher Liu returned home?”

“Yes.” Qiao Nian replied, smiling. The smile on her face faded when she thought of Teacher Liu’s health.

“Don’t worry, your Teacher Liu is blessed by the heavens. He will definitely be fine.” Wang Shuo spoke a few words of comfort, then turned to leave.

Qiao Xin and Zhou Xue stood some distance away, eating refreshments. Seeing Qiao Nian and Su Yan standing together, Zhou Xue frowned.

“Xin Xin, is that b*tch Qiao Nian here to look for Su Yan on purpose?” Zhou Xue had been taken to the police station, and the Zhou family had to spend money to bail her out. Her father was so furious that he refused to give her any allowance for the next two months.

Qiao Xin’s eyes gleamed. Her eyes darted to the side and she said, “I don’t know. This is a banquet for medical students. Why is she here?”

With those words, Zhou Xue instantly understood.

Qiao Nian had been sent away before she finished her first year at the university. Apart from Su Yan, no one else here today would have been her classmate!

“I’ll go speak to her!” Zhou Xue thought of how she had been thoroughly embarrassed in the shopping mall. This time, she had to regain her dignity.

Although Qiao Xin had abandoned her back then, Qiao Xin later explained the situation to Zhou Xue.

Qiao Xin had wanted to go to the Qiao residence to seek reinforcements, but when she saw Zhou Xue coming out of the police station, she felt immensely guilty. As compensation, Qiao Xin gave Zhou Xue 100,000 yuan.

After Zhou Xue received the 100,000 yuan, her anger dissipated somewhat. With immense generosity, Zhou Xue forgave Qiao Xin. Qiao Xin even invited her to this banquet, saying that she hoped for Zhou Xue to find a boyfriend soon.

Zhou Xue walked up to Qiao Nian in her high heels and looked at her, brimming with arrogance. She said furiously, “How dare you attend this banquet? Don’t you have any shame? You’re not even a student of S University. You’re a lunatic. Don’t you feel uncomfortable here?”

Su Yan turned around and walked towards Qiao Xin. Every second he spent around Qiao Nian was utter torture.

“Was being arrested not enough for you?” Qiao Xin raised her eyebrows and looked at Zhou Xue with a smile, saying lightly, “Do you want to go in there again?”

“If it wasn’t for you, how could I have been arrested? You b*tch!” Zhou Xue raised her hand, ready to slap Qiao Nian’s face. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Pa!”

Without waiting for Zhou Xue to make a move, Qiao Nian slapped her first.

Zhou Xue stumbled, collapsing onto a table nearby. Drinks and pastries were strewn all over the floor, and her gown was stained.

With that, Zhou Xue had drawn the attention of everyone in the banquet hall.

Qiao Xin looked worriedly at Zhou Xue. She pursed her lips and said anxiously, “Sister hit Xue’er during the day, and now she’s hit Xue’er again. This…”

“Let’s go take a look!” Su Yan didn’t want to have anything to do with Qiao Nian, but he frowned when he saw that Zhou Xue had been hit.

In the past, Qiao Nian put on a meek facade. Now, much to Su Yan’s disbelief, not only did she stop pretending, but her mental illness had worsened. She actually hit someone in public!

“How dare you hit me!” Zhou Xue glared at Qiao Nian viciously, as if she wanted to swallow Qiao Nian whole.

Qiao Xin walked to Zhou Xue’s side and took out a tissue to help her wipe her face. She said worriedly, “Xue’er, are you okay? Oh my god, you’re bleeding!”

Seeing Qiao Xin step out to defend her, tears of grievance fell from Zhou Xue’s eyes.

Su Yan shielded Qiao Xin and Zhou Xue behind him.. He glared at Qiao Nian and said in disgust, “Qiao Nian, I’ve told you many times that I don’t like you. Please stop disturbing me!”
