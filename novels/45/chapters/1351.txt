1352 Despair

Instinctively, he looked into the living room and saw his mother sitting on the carpet in front of the sofa. Her hair was in a mess, and she was hugging her knees and crying hysterically.

In his mind, his mother was elegant and cold. This was the first time he had seen his mother like this. He had never seen his mother lose her composure like this before.

“Mom.”

He wanted to walk over to comfort her, but he didn’t expect her to stand up directly. She raised her hand to wipe her tears and casually tidied her hair. With red-rimmed eyes, she said tearfully, “Go out for dinner today and come home later.”

With that, his mother went upstairs elegantly, leaving him alone to look at the mess in the living room.

Gu Zhou silently cleaned up the living room and left obediently.

Gu Zhou came back to his senses. He took out his phone and called Gu Ting.

The call went through very quickly. Gu Ting’s surprised voice came through. “Ah Zhou?”

Gu Ting’s voice was deep and strong.

Bai Hui crying helplessly in the living room flashed across Gu Zhou’s mind. His voice turned cold. “Where are you?”

“Europe. There’s something to settle here.”

“Why didn’t you come to visit Grandma?” Gu Zhou frowned, his tone cold.

Gu Ting could naturally hear the displeasure in Gu Zhou’s tone. He pursed his lips slightly and was silent for a moment before saying, “There’s a problem here. I can’t leave for the time being. How’s Grandma’s health?”

“She’s fine.” Gu Zhou could tell that Gu Ting was in a difficult position. He asked, “Is it very troublesome?”

“Yes.”

“Do you need any help?”

“There’s no need,” Gu Ting refused in a low voice.

When Gu Zhou heard Gu Ting’s words, he sighed slightly and said, “I just called Mom.”

After a long time, he didn’t hear Gu Ting’s voice. He frowned and asked, “How long has it been since you visited her?”

“I still have something to do here. I’ll visit Grandma when I’m done.”

Hearing Gu Ting’s perfunctory words, Gu Zhou knew that Gu Ting did not want to mention Bai Hui again. “Yes.”

“How are you feeling? Are you feeling better?”

“I’m still alive for the time being.” With that, Gu Zhou hung up mercilessly.

His parents should have stopped contacting him after his college entrance examination.

Gu Zhou recalled Bai Hui pretending to be strong and going upstairs with red-rimmed eyes. He was a little curious about the situation.

Gu Zhou called Chen Qing in.

Chen Qing quickly walked in and asked, “Second Young Master, are you looking for me?”

“Go and investigate why my parents divorced back then.” Gu Zhou had not wanted to investigate those things, but now he really wanted to know what had happened back then.

Actually, he also wanted to know the ins and outs of the matter directly from Grandma, but he knew her very well. Grandma probably wouldn’t tell him about the past.

“Yes,” Chen Qing replied. Just as he was about to leave, he saw that Gu Zhou didn’t look well. “Second Young Master, the doctor said that you have to rest more recently. Only then can you recover faster.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Got it. Go ahead.” Gu Zhou casually sent Chen Qing away and sat alone on the bed, gradually falling into deep thought.

…

At the entrance of the kindergarten in An City.

After Qiao Nian parked the car, she stood up and walked to the entrance of the kindergarten to wait.

There were many parents waiting to pick up their children around the entrance of the kindergarten. All of them were looking forward to seeing their children again.

Song Yu’s words made Qiao Nian wary. The three children would definitely be very safe in school, but they wouldn’t be safe outside. She had to pick them up personally to prevent any mistakes.

Qiao Nian was carrying a large bag on her shoulder. In the bag were all kinds of poisons, silver needles, and daggers she had prepared.

At half past four in the afternoon, the school bell rang. The originally quiet campus instantly erupted. Many children ran out of the classroom and lined up outside to get ready for school to end.

Gu Qi, Xiao Bao, and Xiao Shi were triplets. The three of them looked very alike. They them came out of the classroom hand in hand. Xiao Shi stood between the two of them, and her two brothers held her hands.

When the three little ones came out, the parents waiting for their children around them immediately erupted.

“Oh my god, triplets!”

“They’re so cute and so good-looking. If only I could give birth to such cute children.”

“I want to touch their faces.”

“I wonder if they’re engaged. I want to create an engagement with them when they’re young!”
