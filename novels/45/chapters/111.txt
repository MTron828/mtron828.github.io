Lin Tao smiled at Director Lin and said, “Dad, you must be secretly overjoyed. You were clearly pining after Nian Nian’s medicinal herbs!”

Director Lin’s smile grew even brighter. “Child, why must you speak such truths aloud?”

“See, you do agree that I’m telling the truth,” Lin Tao teased. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“It’s all my fault for spoiling you. You don’t even know what etiquette is. You should address Qiao Nian as Elder Sis!” Keeping his expression serious, Director Lin began to lecture Lin Tao.

“Stop, stop, stop! I don’t want to listen anymore!” Lin Tao was really worried that Director Lin would continue with his lengthy lecture. She shook her head vigorously. “I’m taking Nian Nian to take a look around our research institute!”

Before Director Lin could say anything, Lin Tao had already pulled Qiao Nian away.

Looking at Lin Tao and Qiao Nian’s retreating backs, Director Lin couldn’t help but smile.

At around nine in the morning, guests began to arrive in a steady stream. Director Lin stood at the door to welcome them, smiling from ear to ear.

Actually, Qiao Nian didn’t like such occasions. If it weren’t for Director Lin and Lin Tao, she wouldn’t have come.

At this moment, Qiao Nian’s phone began to ring. She took out her phone and saw a WeChat message.

[Qiao Xin and Su Yan have the Suranne Grass to Mr. Lin’s research institute.]

Qiao Nian typed [Okay] in response, then put her phone into her bag.

Lin Tao looked at the happy Director Lin. A trace of worry flashed in her eyes. She moved closer to Qiao Nian and asked in a low voice, “Nian Nian, have you really found the Suranne Grass? My father has been waiting for twenty years. I’m a little worried he’ll…”

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Qiao Xin and Su Yan, who had just entered the room. Her lips curved up in a bright smile, and a sly glint flashed in her eyes. “Look, hasn’t the Suranne Grass arrived?”

Lin Tao blinked in confusion. She followed Qiao Nian’s gaze and saw a sweet-looking girl and a young, handsome man walking in.

Because the pair were attractive, they became the center of attention the moment they entered.

Lin Tao looked at Qiao Nian in confusion. Puzzled, she asked, “Those two people are just a couple of guests, and they seem to have only brought themselves. Where exactly is the Suranne Grass?”

Qiao Nian gave a meaningful smile and raised her eyebrow slightly. “Just wait and see! The show will begin very soon.”

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Qiao Xin’s face. Tonight, she would trample Qiao Xin’s arrogance to the ground, so that Qiao Xin would never be able to raise her head again.

At the entrance of the institute, Su Yan was chatting happily with Director Lin.

Standing obediently next to Su Yan, Qiao Xin carefully tugged on his sleeve.

Su Yan glanced at Qiao Xin and nodded. He then looked back at Director Lin. “I’ve specially prepared a small gift for you. I hope you’ll accept it!”

‘When Director Lin heard Su Yan’s words, he casually replied, “You didn’t have to bring any gifts. Bringing yourself is enough. You’re too polite!”

At this moment, Su Yan’s assistant brought in a box about a cubic meter in size. It was draped in red cloth, giving off a mysterious aura.

The people around them couldn’t help but look over.

Qiao Xin had a bright smile on her face. Her eyes curved into crescents as she walked up to the assistant. She especially enjoyed being the center of attention.

At this moment, Qiao Nian walked over, pulling Lin Tao with her. She gave Qiao Xin an impassive glance and asked, “You came?”

Qiao Xin was feeling especially smug when she suddenly heard a familiar voice. She turned around and saw Qiao Nian standing next to Director Lin.

Qiao Xin’s heart skipped a beat.

Qiao Nian. Why would she be here?

Qiao Xin quickly regained her composure, smiling sweetly. “Sister, you’re here too. What a coincidence.”

At this moment, Su Yan’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian. Today, she was wearing a light blue dress, revealing her slender neck and a pair of alluring collarbones. Her hair fell in a smooth wave behind her back. She looked like a fairy maiden who had descended from the skies. Su Yan couldn’t take his eyes off her..
