1540 Exposure

When Shen Mei heard Qiao Nian leave, she slowly opened her eyes.

Shen Mei murmured softly. Her gaze fell on the ceiling, and her eyes were filled with confusion. She narrowed her eyes slightly. There seemed to be a vortex in her clear eyes, bringing her deep into her memories. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

In the pavilion not far from the entrance of the palace, only Lina and Aisha were standing.

Lina looked at Aisha impatiently, her tone cold. “I told you, it’s a fact that Annie tried to murder my mother. She was locked up just following normal procedure.”

Aisha raised her eyebrows slightly. She walked up to Lina and looked down at her. She enunciated each word clearly. “I’ve never asked you to let Annie go to the public. My request is very simple. As long as you secretly let Annie go, I’ll find a death row criminal to replace her. At that time, you just have to interrogate that scapegoat.”

Lina’s pupils dilated slightly. She looked at Aisha in disbelief and smiled disdainfully. “Do you know what you’re saying?”

“Hide the truth? What a brilliant idea. Only a smart person like me, Princess Aisha, can think of it.” Aisha raised her eyebrows smugly. Seeing that Lina was stunned, she continued, “Are you amazed by my intelligence? No wonder. Your mother is a fool, so how could she give birth to a smart person?”

Lina smiled coldly, then pursed her lips and said, “Aisha, do you like Wright?”

“Yes, what’s wrong?” Aisha placed a hand on her hip and looked at Lina in disdain. “If you hadn’t been flirting in front of Wright all day and seducing him, I would have married him long ago. I might even have a child!”

The more Aisha thought about it, the angrier she became. Lina was so ugly. What sorcery did Lina use to make Wright fall head over heels for Lina?

Aisha frowned and questioned coldly, “Did you drug Wright?”

“What?” Lina asked, frowning slightly.

“If you hadn’t drugged Wright, how could Wright have taken a liking to you?” Aisha sized Lina up, as if she was trash.

Lina was speechless.

Lina took a deep breath. She looked at Aisha and said, “Aisha, I have something to ask.”

“What?” Aisha looked at Lina angrily, her mind filled with thoughts of where to get that medicine that fascinated men.

“If you like Wright so much, why did you still sleep with Wright’s assistant, Amon?” Lina stared unblinkingly at Aisha’s face and saw that her face was getting redder and redder.

“W-What nonsense are you spouting!” Aisha stammered. “I don’t understand what you’re saying at all.”

“It doesn’t matter if you understand or not.” Lina smiled at Aisha and said calmly, “I have a video of you and Amon on the bed. All this time, I’ve treated you as my fourth sister, so I’ve never thought of giving this video to Wright, let alone using it to threaten you.”

Aisha’s face turned from red to greenish-gray. Her lips parted slightly, and she breathed heavily.

“You…” Aisha’s eyes widened in anger as she glared at Lina.

Lina shook her head slightly and said regretfully, “I remember that Bata was kissed forcefully, but Wright is a clean freak. He had to break up with Bata no matter what.”

Aisha had been chasing Wright for so long. How could she not know that Bata had been forcefully kissed?
