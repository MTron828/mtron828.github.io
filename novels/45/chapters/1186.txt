1187 meeting

Qiao Nian looked at the two children. “The two of you will stay at home and listen to Grandma obediently. When Daddy and Mommy return, we’ll bring you to the amusement park, okay?”

Thank you readers!

When Gu Qi heard Qiao Nian’s words, he took a step back and left her arms. He looked at Qiao Nian seriously and asked expectantly, “Mommy, are you and Daddy going to look for our younger brother?”

When Xiao Shi heard Gu Qi’s words, she turned to look at him and retorted in a childish voice, “Daddy and Mommy are going to look for our sister!”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She looked at the two of them in surprise and asked in confusion, “How did you know about this?”

“We accidentally overheard what you said to Daddy,” Gu Qi said.

Xiao Shi took Qiao Nian’s hand, her eyes filled with fear and unease. She asked anxiously, “Mommy, will Sister be bullied like me? Will she…”

Xiao Shi no longer dared to continue.

After she returned to the Gu family, she finally understood how a child should live.

She shouldn’t have to worry about food or clothes at home, nor did she have to spend so much effort to take care of someone. She just had to be herself.

She was really afraid that her sister would have a harder time than her!

When Qiao Nian heard Xiao Shi’s words, she hurriedly shook her head and said, “Don’t worry, it won’t be like this. Mommy will definitely bring Sister back safely.”

Xiao Shi pursed her lips and held back her tears. She nodded vigorously, hoping that her mommy would find her sister soon.

Xiao Shi and Gu Qi sent Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian to the parking lot. She watched as her parents’ car left the house and quickly ran after them. Then, she distanced herself from the car and waved at them! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Xiao Shi looked at the departing car with tears in her eyes. School would start tomorrow. Ever since she went to school with her brother, she really hoped that her daddy and mommy could send her to school. Then, she could proudly introduce her daddy and mommy to her classmates.

But she knew in her heart that the most important thing for Daddy and Mommy now was to find their sister!

Moreover, she didn’t want her sister to be bullied by bad people.

Hence, she could not selfishly leave her daddy and mommy behind.

Qiao Nian sat in the front passenger seat and looked at Xiao Shi and Gu Qi’s retreating figures in the rearview mirror. She sighed heavily.

Actually, they were not looking for their third child this time. To be precise, they were investigating the clues of the person behind the scenes. They might also find clues about their third child.

Gu Zhou drove Qiao Nian to the Gu family’s airport.

When they got off the plane, it was already dark. It was nine in the evening.

The moment they got off the plane, they saw Jiang Chi standing there in a white suit from afar.

Jiang Chi was very tall and his facial features were beautiful. One could see him at a glance in the crowd. The arrogance in his eyes made the people around him retreat.

Jiang Chi’s skin seemed to be even paler than before.

Beside him were many bodyguards in black suits.

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian walked over, Chen Qing following closely behind them.

Qiao Nian walked up to Jiang Chi with a polite and distant smile on her face. “Mr. Jiang.”

When Jiang Chi saw Qiao Nian, a glint flashed across his eyes, but it quickly disappeared. He nodded slightly, his lips curving up imperceptibly. He said gentlemanly, “Welcome, Miss Qiao and Mr. Gu!”

Jiang Chi’s gaze finally landed on Gu Zhou’s face and he reached out his hand.

Gu Zhou looked at Jiang Chi. The two of them clasped their hands and their eyes met. This could be considered a temporary alliance!

Jiang Chi turned around slightly and gestured for them to walk.

The bodyguards immediately lined up in two rows and parted to the sides, making way.

The other pedestrians at the airport were all shocked and hurriedly took a few steps back.

The three of them walked out side by side.

Qiao Nian still remembered the first time the three of them had met. At that time, they were ready to fight.

Qiao Nian turned to look at Jiang Chi and asked curiously, “How did you ask Mr. Chen out previously?”

“I sent an invitation!” Jiang Chi said calmly.

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze slightly. With Jiang Chi’s status in MY, Mr. Chen should have accepted the appointment.

Why didn’t Mr. Chen agree? Wasn’t he afraid of angering Jiang Chi?
