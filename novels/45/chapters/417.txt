Chapter 418: Can’t Keep a Low Profile

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The man was about 1.8 meters tall, the kind that was instantly noticed when standing in a crowd. Of course, others noticed him not because of his height, but because of his appearance and figure.

His facial features were very exquisite. Even if he disguised himself as a woman, no one would doubt his gender.

He had a buzz cut and looked like a tough guy. He looked a little obedient, but also a little handsome.

This person was simply a walking hormone stimulator!

When he appeared, he instantly attracted the attention of countless young socialites. Those people wished they could pounce on him.

When the man approached them and they looked at him closely, they would realize that he was even more handsome.

“Brother.” When the man smiled, two shallow dimples appeared.

His voice was low, pleasant, and a little sultry.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but be attracted to him.

At this moment, Qiao Nian noticed that a middle-aged man was frowning.

Qiao Nian’s gaze landed on the middle-aged man’s face. This man seemed to hate her very much, as if he was unwilling to be her bodyguard.

However, this man was, after all, a bodyguard given to her by Gu Zhou. She still extended her hand. “Hello, I’ll leave my personal safety to you from now on!”

The bodyguard turned to the side, ignoring Qiao Nian.

......

At this moment, the handsome man, who exuded hormones, held Qiao Nian’s hand and said gentlemanly, “It’s my honor to serve a beautiful and noble young mistress like you!”

Qiao Nian was slightly taken aback.

This man was her bodyguard?

Was Gu Zhou really serious? VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Was it really okay to find a man who was better-looking than a woman to be her bodyguard?

Was Gu Zhou too confident, or did he trust her too much?

The man’s skin was that of healthy wheat color. Perhaps it was because he was a bodyguard, but his hands were covered in calluses.

When she touched his hand, Qiao Nian felt a little awkward, and an indescribable sense of security.

The man kept smiling at Qiao Nian, his dimples showing.

Lu Zhu, who was standing at the side, coughed.

Only then did Qiao Nian notice that she had been distracted. She smiled awkwardly and said, “Hello, please take care of me in the future!”

The man’s smile widened. “My name is Ah Rao!”

“Qiao Nian!”

Only then did she let go.

At this moment, someone shouted, “The competition has begun!”

Ah Rao immediately retracted his smile and stood beside Qiao Nian with his hands behind his back.

Lu Zhu whispered a few words of advice into Ah Rao’s ear before leaving with the middle-aged man.

Ah Rao’s aura was too strong. Even though he was standing silently at the side, Qiao Nian could still sense his presence.

Qiao Nian led Ah Rao towards the second building. Along the way, many people kept staring at them and discussing among themselves.

“This little model is quite capable. She has charmed many handsome men!”

“How strange. Who is this man? Why haven’t I seen him before?”

“His figure is really good. Don’t tell me he is also a model!”

“There are many people here who like men. With him like this, he’ll probably be liked by others soon!”

“I don’t think he looks like a model at all. Don’t tell me he’s from an aristocratic family!”

… .

Qiao Nian listened expressionlessly to the gossip.

Now, she felt that even if she wore no makeup, others would probably notice her because of Ah Rao. It was impossible for her to keep a low profile here.

Not long after, Qiao Nian arrived at Building No. 2.

Everyone had also arrived at Building No. 2. The moment they entered, they were shocked and could not regain their senses for a long time.

In the middle of them was a piece of jade. It was about 1.6 meters tall and crystal clear. It was so beautiful that no one could look away.

When everyone passed by the jadeite, they could still see their own reflections. Under the light, this jadeite was even more dazzling than a diamond.

Qiao Nian felt that this piece of jade could at least be exchanged for 20 million yuan. Perhaps, the price would even be higher.
