Chapter 65: Her Smile Put Sunflowers To Shame

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Her smile put sunflowers to shame.

When everyone saw Qiao Nian’s charming smile, they finally understood what that sentence meant.

According to the ancients, beauty lies in not one’s skin, but in one’s bones. Qiao Nian’s beauty seemed to fulfill both aspects. Her beauty could conquer nations.

In the past, everyone only knew that Qiao Nian was mentally ill. No one cared whether she was pretty. But now that they knew that Qiao Nian was the principal of the school, the hero who saved the university, the way they looked at her changed.

Wang An looked at his assistant and said, “Take Shen Xing with you to settle the withdrawal procedure.”

“Yes, sir!”

Shen Xing looked at Wang An in despair. Her gaze gradually moved to Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian!

It was all Qiao Nian’s fault!

She first caused Shen Xing to lose face at Grandma’s birthday banquet. Now, she even caused her to be expelled!

Shen Xing pushed away the people next to her and walked quickly to Qiao Nian. With teary eyes, she begged, “Qiao Nian—no, Principal Qiao—I beg you. Please let me off. Just let me off. I’m begging you.”

Qiao Nian looked at Shen Xing calmly. She did not speak.

Ever since the birthday banquet, where Shen Xing had been thoroughly humiliated, she had been bent on studying hard to regain a foothold in high society. However, she had never expected that she would offend Qiao Nian.

“Principal Qiao, if I’m expelled, my grandmother will be angered to death. Please, on account that we’re both women…”

“Shen Xing, are you kidding me?” Sarcasm dripped from Qiao Nian’s words.

If Qiao Nian had not sealed her own acupuncture points during Matriarch Shen’s birthday banquet, she would have been humiliated as well.

Fortunately, Gu Zhou had been a gentleman, and did not take advantage of her. Otherwise, she would have truly gotten into trouble.

Qiao Nian leaned over and spoke into Shen Xing’s ear in a voice that only the two of them could hear. “When you gave me the lust drug, why didn’t you think about what you just said? We are both women, are we not?”

When Shen Xing heard Qiao Nian’s words, her legs began to tremble non-stop. She fell to her knees in front of Qiao Nian.

“I know I was in the wrong. I’m begging you, please let me off this once.” Shen Xing begged pitifully. If she was really expelled, then she would no longer be able to maintain her position in the Shen family.

Qiao Nian looked down at Shen Xing. She stepped away, about to leave.

However, no matter how Shen Xing begged, it did not change the fact that the security guards were already pulling her away.

Qiao Nian’s gaze swept over Qiao Xin again and she said lightly, “Qiao Xin shall be given a demerit!”

Wang An nodded approvingly.

Qiao Xin stood rooted to the ground, her face pale. She swayed on the spot, biting her lower lip, with an unwilling expression on her face. However, she didn’t dare to protest.

Su Yan, who was standing beside Qiao Xin, looked at Qiao Nian in astonishment. This time, when he looked at Qiao Nian more closely, he realized that she was breathtakingly beautiful, like a plum blossom in the snow.

At this moment, Su Yan regretted his actions. If he could be together with Qiao Nian, then he…

The graduation banquet continued as planned. By the time it ended, Su Yan still hadn’t recovered from the shock that Qiao Nian was the principal.

Seeing that Qiao Nian was about to leave, Su Yan chased after her and blocked her and Wang An’s path.

Wang An glared at Su Yan in displeasure. Just as he was about to speak, Qiao Nian spoke.

“Student Su, what can I do for you?”

Student Su?

In the past, she had always addressed him as Brother Su Yan. Now, she was addressing him as Student Su?

Strangely, Su Yan felt a sense of abandonment. However, he calmed down very quickly. He knew that Qiao Nian was playing hard to get in order to seduce him.

Su Yan cleared his throat and smiled in a gentlemanly manner. “Can we talk?”

Qiao Nian glanced at Wang An.

Wang An immediately understood what Qiao Nian meant. He walked away.

Seeing that everyone had left, Su Yan smiled at Qiao Nian. “Do you want to join me at the coffee shop…” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Student Su, it’s getting late. I have other things to do.” Qiao Nian looked impatient.

She wanted to return home early. She wanted to know who the father of her dead child was.

She had no time for people like Su Yan.
