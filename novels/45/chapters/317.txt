Chapter 318: Discovery

Gu Qi stood there calmly. He was not surprised by Gu Zhou’s appearance, as if he had known for a long time that Gu Zhou had not left.

Gu Zhou quickly walked up to Gu Qi and took his cold hand. After examining it carefully, he realized that Gu Qi’s palm had been red. Only then did he realize that Zhang Yi must have hit Gu Qi before.

A trace of ruthlessness flashed in Gu Zhou’s eyes. Suppressing his anger, he bent down and picked Gu Qi up, handing him to Chen Qing. “Take him upstairs now. Take good care of Young Master!”

Chen Qing didn’t even need to look at Gu Zhou’s expression. He had long sensed the cold aura emanating from Gu Zhou. He knew that Zhang Yi would definitely suffer tonight.

Chen Qing carried Gu Qi back upstairs and carefully placed him on the bed. He took Gu Qi’s hand and looked at the red mark on it. His eyes couldn’t help but turn red.

Even after Chen Qing closed the door, he could still hear the tragic cries downstairs. Gradually, there was no more sound, and the surroundings quietened down.

Chen Qing couldn’t help but frown. When Zhang Yi called, she said that Young Master had gone missing, so he and Second Young Master rushed over overnight.

After investigating the surveillance cameras, Chen Qing and Gu Zhou discovered that Zhang Yi clearly knew that Young Master would leave the house for a period of time every day, but she had never told them.

However, this time, the young master had gone out at night. Zhang Yi was probably afraid of taking responsibility, so she called.

Logically speaking, when Young Master went out, Zhang Yi should have gone out with him. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Why had Zhang Yi been staying at home all this time, letting Young Master go out alone?

They suspected that there was something wrong with Zhang Yi.

Hence, this time, Second Young Master got the driver to drive away, creating the illusion that they had already left. Then, he secretly ran to the door to listen.

They had thought that Zhang Yi might not be as good to Young Master as she seemed to be. Hence, when Young Master ran out, she ignored him.

But they had never expected Zhang Yi to be so beastly as to hit Young Master.

This time, they heard these vicious voices. There was no telling how much more they didn’t hear.

Zhang Yi had been recommended by the teachers of Second Young Master’s High School. They said that she was a good girl who worked hard, but they had never expected this good girl to be so vicious.

If the young master understood her words, how sad would he be?

Some children could not be cured of the trauma left behind by their childhood.

At the thought of this, Chen Qing’s heart ached. He hugged Gu Qi tightly.

Usually, Second Young Master would ask him to make a move. This time, Second Young Master must have been so angry that he made a move himself.

It seemed that Zhang Yi would not live to see tomorrow.

She had once looked at Gu Qi in her arms with a calm expression. There didn’t seem to be a trace of fear on her face.

Chen Qing only hoped that Young Master did not understand what Zhang Yi was saying. That way, Young Master would not be traumatized.

At this moment, Gu Zhou pushed the door open and walked in.

He walked straight to Gu Qi. Seeing how quiet Gu Qi was, his heart ached.

Gu Qi was so obedient. He seemed to be used to it.

Gu Qi looked up at Gu Zhou. Their eyes met.

Gu Zhou could only hope that Gu Qi didn’t understand what Zhang Yi was saying. He reached out and pulled Gu Qi into his arms, saying guiltily, “I’m sorry. I was negligent. I didn’t take good care of you.”

Gu Qi’s grape-like eyes moved. He looked up at Gu Zhou. This was the second time his father had hugged him.

His father had first carried him on the sofa downstairs.

All this time, he had thought that his father didn’t like him. In the past, Grandma used to accompany him. When Grandma said that she wanted to go home sometimes, she left him here alone.

He was the only one left here.

He had also thought of following Grandma home, but Grandma had instructed him to stay here and listen to Zhang Yi.
