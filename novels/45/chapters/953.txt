954 Protecting His Wife

Chen Qing looked at Gu Zhou’s back in admiration.

Wow!

Second Young Master was indeed handsome!

Second Young Master was really protective of his wife!

!!

There was probably no man in the world who could compare to Second Young Master!

After Gu Zhou left, Chen Qing invited the doctor in.

The doctor had also heard about the commotion in this ward. When he saw Qiao Shan lying in a pool of blood with his own eyes, he was so frightened that his face turned pale.

He carefully examined Qiao Shan’s leg, then said to Qiao Xin and Chen Qing, “The patient’s injuries are very serious. He needs to undergo surgery to amputate his leg immediately.”

When Qiao Xin heard Qiao Shan’s words, she was stunned. Her face turned pale in fear, and tears fell from her eyes. Her mind was in a mess.

What should he do?

His father would lose a leg in the future!

The doctor hurriedly went out to get the nurses to prepare to move the bed, planning to bring Qiao Shan directly to the operating theater.

After getting the results Second Young Master wanted, Chen Qing left the hospital.

When Su Xue and Qiao Yu returned from outside the hospital, they saw many people gathered around their ward from afar. They could vaguely hear Qiao Xin crying. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Su Xue was slightly stunned. Thinking that something had happened to Qiao Xin again, she hurriedly rushed in. Just as she entered, she saw Qiao Xin sitting on the ground, crying. There was a lot of blood on her, and Qiao Shan was lying beside her.

Oh my god!

What had happened?

Su Xue slowed down, feeling that there was something wrong with her eyes.

After Qiao Yu walked in, he closed the door of the ward. Looking at the unconscious Qiao Shan, he frowned and asked, “What’s wrong with Dad?”

When Qiao Xin saw that Su Xue and Qiao Yu had returned, the grievance in her heart exploded in an instant. She cried, “It’s Gu Zhou. Gu Zhou has gone crazy. He broke Dad’s leg!”

“Gu Zhou?” Qiao Yu frowned slightly.

Qiao Xin told him everything about Gu Zhou’s visit, tears streaming down her face.

Su Xue’s heart ached for Qiao Xin. She hugged her and coaxed softly, “It’s okay, it’s okay. Don’t be afraid!”

Qiao Yu’s expression darkened. He asked coldly, “Back then, in order to protect your leg, you took the initiative to hit Father’s leg?”

Qiao Xin’s actions stunned Qiao Yu.

At the thought of this, Qiao Xin felt terrible. She cried even harder. “I was forced. I had no choice. I… Ah!”

Bam!

Qiao Yu raised his hand and slapped Qiao Xin’s face hard. His eyes were filled with burning anger as he glared at Qiao Xin angrily. Gritting his teeth, he said, “You’re worse than a beast!”

Qiao Xin was stunned again. She looked at Qiao Yu in surprise and muttered, “Brother, this… this is the second time you’ve hit me!”

Qiao Yu was so angry that his temples were throbbing. He raised his hand to hit her again, but Su Xue stopped him.

Su Xue grabbed Qiao Yu’s hand and said earnestly, “Qiao Yu, your sister might be injured too. Hurry up and call the doctor over!”

Was Qiao Xin injured too?

Qiao Yu’s eyes were filled with disappointment. He looked at Su Xue in front of him and felt extremely sad. He asked, “Mom, do you plan to always protect her?”

“What else?” Su Xue was also so anxious that her eyes were red. She asked, “She’s still young. She still has most of her life to live. How can you bear to let her be a cripple?”

“She might as well be crippled!”

Su Xue’s eyes widened. She said angrily, “What nonsense are you spouting? Your father has already become a cripple. Why? Do you want your sister to be in a wheelchair at such a young age and be unable to take care of herself for the rest of her life?”

Qiao Xin’s eyes were red-rimmed. She sniffled and said pitifully, “Brother, I already know my mistake. If Gu Zhou hadn’t gone too far, Dad wouldn’t have become like this. It’s all Gu Zhou’s fault!”

Initially, Qiao Yu didn’t want to speak, but when he heard Qiao Xin’s words, his gaze fell on her face. He questioned coldly, “Why did you let Dad bear the consequences of your mistake? What did he do wrong?”

Qiao Yu’s words rendered Su Xue and Qiao Xin speechless.

At this moment, there was a knock on the door of the ward. Qiao Yu had locked the door because he didn’t want anyone to watch the commotion.

He gave Qiao Xin a cold look, then turned and walked towards the door.
