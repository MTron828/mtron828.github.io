1520 Puppet

Although the sun was shining brightly, the president felt extremely cold. His hands were trembling slightly, and his palms were covered in cold sweat.

Even if they had differences in many ways, there was no need to fight to the death for the throne.

“Puppet?” The President’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. His voice trembled a little, but he quickly calmed down. “Is it what I think it is?”

“Yes.” Qiao Nian paused for a moment and continued, “Madam will become a puppet. Everything she says and does will be under the instructions of the master of the mother parasite.”

The president’s eyes were cold, mixed with bloodlust. He had always treated Mark as his brother, but Mark had tested his bottom line in every way.

The president pursed his lips tightly. Now, he would never give in again. He wanted to get back everything that belonged to him!

He tried hard to suppress the anger in his heart. His temples were throbbing with anger as he asked in a low voice, “Miss Qiao, can my Madam be saved?”

Qiao Nian pondered for a moment. She looked at Shen Mei not far away and hesitated for a moment before saying, “I’ll do my best.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, a trace of hope flashed in the president’s eyes. He promised solemnly, “As long as Madam can recover, I’ll agree to any request of yours, Miss Qiao!”

Qiao Nian looked at the president, who was standing beside her. She could hear the pleading in the president’s words. She had long thought it through, so she said, “Mr. President, Madam’s situation is a little complicated. If you want to treat her, I need your cooperation.”

“Yes, I’ll cooperate fully. As long as you want to know, I’ll tell you everything in detail,” the president said with a firm gaze.

Qiao Nian smiled. Although Shen Mei didn’t look like Professor Shen’s daughter at all, plastic surgery technology was so advanced now. Perhaps Shen Mei had undergone plastic surgery now.

However, she could determine if Shen Mei was Professor Shen’s daughter through her bone structure.

Qiao Nian had a vague feeling that she had to investigate thoroughly. Otherwise, she would regret it for the rest of her life.

Qiao Nian looked at the president beside her and said with a complicated expression, “We have to find all the surgeries and medicine Madam has done in the past. Otherwise, it might cause a huge problem for my treatment. Madam President might…”

She didn’t make her last sentence clear, but she knew in her heart that the president should understand what she meant.

Qiao Nian had always trusted her intuition the most. She felt that she had to investigate Madam President’s background. She couldn’t let go of any details.

When the president heard Qiao Nian’s words, a trace of surprise flashed in his eyes. For some reason, he felt that Qiao Nian seemed to know everything.

But this was impossible!

Qiao Nian was still young back then. Moreover, at that time, Qiao Nian didn’t have the ability to come to Europe at all.

Shen Mei’s matter was also done by his people. Those people had long been arranged by him.

The president narrowed his eyes slightly and looked at Shen Mei not far away.

But.

If he insisted on hiding it, what if Shen Mei’s treatment failed?

Could it be that he was going to personally bury his Madam’s life?

The president knew very well that if he continued to hesitate, it was very likely to arouse Qiao Nian’s suspicion. Hence, he pretended to be calm and said, “Yes, I’ll get someone to organize the information.”

On the surface, Qiao Nian looked at Shen Mei and Lina, who were not far away. In reality, she had been secretly observing the president.

When the president answered her just now, he frowned slightly and paused. Could it be that the president had planned to hide something?

Qiao Nian knew what to do, but she couldn’t force the president directly. She couldn’t let him discover her true motive. She said gently, “I’ll go get ready before giving Madam basic treatment. However, Mr. President, you have to prepare Madam’s past medical records as soon as possible. I’m very worried that the medicine I’m using now will clash with the medicine Madam used previously.”
