Chapter 254: Provocation

Qiao Nian frowned slightly. She couldn’t be bothered with people like Gao Lin.

However, things never went the way they were planned.

In her high heels, Gao Lin walked proudly to Qiao Nian. She sized Qiao Nian up with disdain and smiled smugly. “Tsk, tsk. What a pity!”

When Qiao Nian heard Gao Lin’s words, she couldn’t be bothered with her. She lowered her head and continued studying the score.

Gao Lin lowered her gaze and her gaze fell on the score in Qiao Nian’s hand. Her heart suddenly jumped to her throat.

Missing?

Wasn’t this the song Brother Cao had asked Sister Xia Xue to play?

From the looks of it, Qiao Nian seemed to be teaching Wang Xuan.

Did Qiao Nian know how to play too?

But Gao Lin quickly understood.

How was this possible?

She guessed that Qiao Nian could only play the zither. How would she have the time to study the violin?

After all, Qiao Nian was just a country bumpkin. Even if she knew the score, she would probably stumble over it. It was impossible to play such a tune without the guidance of a teacher.

Gao Lin heaved a sigh of relief. Her lips pursed slightly as she shook her head and sighed. “Sigh, what a pity!”

Wang Xue had been studying the score seriously. When she heard Gao Lin’s annoying voice, her mood instantly soured. She frowned impatiently and looked up at Gao Lin, saying disdainfully, “If you’re sick, go to the mental hospital yourself. Don’t sigh here. If I didn’t know better, I would think that your family is holding a funeral! Pft, what bad luck!”

If it were any other time, Gao Lin would have scolded Wang Xuan. However, she was in a good mood now and said smugly, “Why can’t I watch you? Do you think this classroom belongs to your family? Look at all of you. For a ticket to Mr. Dong Hua, you’ve caused such a ruckus! This is simply disrespectful!”

When Qiao Nian heard Gao Lin’s words, her eyes darkened. She looked at Gao Lin in confusion. Gao Lin’s face was filled with arrogance, as if she was trampling everyone under her feet.

Qiao Nian looked at Gao Lin with a complicated expression, remaining silent.

However, Gao Lin had spoken quite loudly just now. Everyone in the class had heard her words. The other students looked at Gao Lin in disdain.

“Gao Lin is really interesting. She makes it sound like Mr. Dong Hua’s concert is like a wet market that anyone can enter!”

“That’s right, that’s right. Previously, she even gave Ye Ran a handbag for the tickets to Mr. Dong Hua’s concert. I didn’t expect Ye Ran to have a fake ticket! She really made a mistake!”

“I wonder where she gets her sense of superiority from. She must be crazy!”

…

When Gao Lin heard the other students speaking up for Qiao Nian, she frowned slightly. Pretending to be unbothered, she said, “All of you are really too ignorant. Don’t let everyone speak up for her just because she has a ticket. You have to broaden your horizons, and not just care about a ticket!”

When the other students heard Gao Lin’s words, they all laughed.

“After saying so much, you don’t have a ticket to Mr. Dong Hua’s concert either, right? You can’t even get in, and you’re still telling us what to do. What do you think?”

“In the past, I always thought that Gao Lin just had bad eyesight. Now, it seems that her brain isn’t working either.”

“Is she mentally ill from the shock?”

…

When Gao Lin heard their words, she rolled her eyes silently and said, “I can’t be bothered to argue with people like you who have no sense of propriety. Qiao Nian is just attending Mr. Dong Hua’s concert, but I’m different. I’m going to participate!”

When Gao Lin said this, everyone fell silent.

Qiao Nian didn’t even bother looking at Gao Lin. She lowered her head and continued with her work.

Suddenly, the entire class roared.

“Gao Lin, are you crazy? Or are you dreaming? How is it possible for you to participate in Mr. Dong Hua’s concert?” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“That’s right, that’s right. Gao Lin, if you haven’t woken up, hurry up and go back to sleep. You’ll have everything in your dreams!”

“Gao Lin, let me call the ambulance for you. I’ll take you to the mental hospital. What do you think?”
