827 Afraid of Losing Her

Song Man shook her head and pulled Xiao Shi to the sofa to sit down. “I’m really fine. Don’t worry!”

“But there’s blood on the ground. How can she be fine?” There was a hint of sadness in her voice. In the past, when Mommy took things too hard, she would hurt herself. There were still traces of past injuries on Mommy’s arms and legs. She hurriedly pulled Song Man’s arm. “Let me see where you’re injured!”

Seeing that Xiao Shi was so concerned about her, Song Man heaved a sigh of relief. Xiao Shi really loved her the most.

“Don’t worry, I’m really fine this time. Mommy was just being stubborn for a moment and didn’t think it through!”

“Why?” Xiao Shi looked at Song Man in confusion. What exactly had happened between her brother and Mommy?

When Song Man heard Xiao Shi’s question, she said the excuse she had long thought of. “Xiao Shi, do you still remember that you were protecting Qiao Nian just now?”

Xiao Shi lowered her gaze and did not speak. In her brother’s heart, Auntie Nian Nian was a very, very important person. Perhaps it was because of this that her brother and Mommy had argued.

Song Man thought that she had made a mistake, so she continued dejectedly, “Just now, you were protecting Qiao Nian. It made me feel as if you wanted to live with her and never want Mommy again. Mommy felt that you didn’t love Mommy anymore. You loved Qiao Nian more.”

“Mommy, that won’t happen. You were the person I loved the most when I was young. Just now…”

Before she could finish speaking, she didn’t know how to explain because she had agreed with her brother to hide the fact that they had swapped identities.

In Song Man’s opinion, the pause meant that she liked Qiao Nian a lot. Song Man said pitifully, “I know I don’t have the ability to take good care of you, and I still want you to take care of me. Your current attitude already proves that you like Qiao Nian very much. Perhaps as time passes, you might already treat Qiao Nian as the person you love the most! But you’re my child. How can I tolerate you being with other women?”

Xiao Shi hurriedly shook her head and said with certainty, “No, I won’t. I’ll only be with you in the future. You’re the person who treats me the best in this world!”

“Xiao Shi, I know everything you’re saying, but your attitude back then did hurt me. Mommy has relied on you for the past five years. Mommy can’t accept another woman appearing in your life for the time being.”

Song Man’s tears fell uncontrollably. She cried and said, “Previously, I ruined my health to support you. I just wanted you to grow up safely, but Mommy really didn’t have the strength to work for the past two years. I could only rely on you for support. The two of us lived together. Although the past days were very bitter and tiring, we all survived. Mommy really can’t lose you!”

Xiao Shi looked at Song Man with teary eyes. Thinking of the past, she thought of her mother. She had hit her because she was afraid that she would leave. She understood her mother’s thoughts.

“Xiao Shi, when you were standing with Qiao Nian just now, I felt that the two of you seemed to be more like mother and daughter. Without you, Mommy really doesn’t have the motivation to live!”

Towards the end, Song Man was already furious.

The reason why she had hit Xiao Shi was not only because she was disobedient, but also because she was afraid that she would lose her. Even if she did not love her much, she hoped that Xiao Shi would stay by her side.

When she heard Song Man’s words, she took the initiative to hug her tightly and said tearfully, “Mommy, don’t be sad. I’ll listen to you in the future!”

Xiao Shi believed that if Mommy knew what kind of person Auntie Nian Nian was, she would definitely get along well with her. That way, Mommy would let her speak to Auntie Nian Nian.

When Song Man heard Xiao Shi’s words, she hugged her back and said gratefully, “Thank you, Xiao Shi. Xiao Shi, you’re the best!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Xiao Shi looked up from Song Man’s arms and gently wiped the tears off her face with her small hand. She said comfortingly, “Mommy, don’t cry. Mommy used to be very good-looking. If you cry, you’ll become ugly!”

The gloom in Song Man’s heart instantly disappeared. She couldn’t help but laugh through her tears. She lowered her head and pressed her forehead against Xiao Shi’s.

At this moment, Song Man recalled the first time she had seen her when she was young. Xiao Shi was still a baby in swaddling clothes. When she saw her when she was young, a bright smile appeared on her face.

Xiao Shi’s body stiffened slightly, then she sat quietly on the spot, not moving. Only when the tears on Mommy’s face fell on her face did she say, “Mommy, I’ll help you wipe your tears!”
