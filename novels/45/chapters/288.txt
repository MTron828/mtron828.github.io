Chapter 289: Apologizing

Brother Cao was a person who repented immediately. He hurriedly reached out to Qiao Nian and said apologetically, “Miss Qiao Nian, I’m really sorry for what happened just now. Previously, Mr. Dong Hua asked me to take notice of a girl, but that girl got Mr. Dong Hua drunk and tried to climb into his bed. From then on, Dong Hua never told me about other girls again. This time, I thought it was still the same thing, so it was all a misunderstanding. A misunderstanding. Please don’t mind me!”

Seeing that Brother Cao had admitted his mistake so frankly, and that there was indeed a reason for it, Qiao Nian reached out to shake his hand. “It’s good that the misunderstanding has been resolved.”

Qiao Nian was still a little surprised. Brother Cao wasn’t very smart. How did he become a top manager?

After Brother Cao let go of Qiao Nian’s hand, he glanced at Lu Nian timidly and asked carefully, “What should we do now?”

Lu Nian didn’t look at Brother Cao. His gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. His voice was a little low and magnetic. “Since you’ve called me Big Brother, I’ll acknowledge you as my god-sister. Do whatever you want. No matter what happens, I’ll bear the consequences.”

Qiao Nian’s lips curved up slightly. For some reason, she felt that Mr. Lu Nian was understanding her more and more. This feeling was not bad.

Brother Cao looked at the smile on Qiao Nian’s face and vaguely sensed a dangerous aura. His heart skipped a beat. For some reason, he felt that this young lady’s personality was similar to Dong Hua’s.

“Will it affect anything?” Brother Cao asked weakly.

Qiao Nian’s lips curved up slightly. She said unhurriedly, “Since you’ve already decided to go all out, the more sensational the better.”

Lu Nian’s lips curved up in agreement.

Brother Cao looked at Lu Nian in disbelief.

What happened to keeping a low profile?

Why did he have to be so high-profile now?

With her hands behind her back, Qiao Nian took a step back and smiled at Lu Nian. “Mr. Dong Hua, I’ll see you later.”

With that, Qiao Nian walked out.

Brother Cao’s heart was beating faster and faster. He looked at Lu Nian, who was looking at Qiao Nian’s back, and frowned. Worriedly, he said, “Lu Nian, didn’t you say previously that you wanted to keep a low profile? Moreover, your brother also said that you had to keep a low profile and not disturb the peace and quiet of the school! Aren’t you causing chaos in the school?”

“He’s not here,” Lu Nian said nonchalantly.

It was rare to meet such an interesting and talented girl. Since she wanted to make a scene, he would accompany her!

Brother Cao was shocked.

Brother Cao didn’t understand what kind of magic that little girl, Qiao Nian, had. How could she make Mr. Dong Hua, who had always kept a low profile, act so brazenly?

…

After Qiao Nian returned to the classroom, her mind was filled with thoughts of how to cause trouble.

Before long, she saw Gao Lin walking in.

Gao Lin looked worried. She must have just returned from Xia Xue’s room.

Sensing Qiao Nian’s gaze, Gao Lin glanced at her, then obediently returned to her seat.

When she was in the recording studio just now, she had been recording with Sister Xia Xue. For some reason, she clearly felt that Sister Xia Xue was already working very hard, but the music she recorded was always a little lacking.

To be precise, Sister Xia Xue played every song well, but every song was empty and soulless, unable to move the audience.

At that time, when she saw that Xia Xue was in a daze, she began to have a heart-to-heart chat with her. She wanted Xia Xue to get her bearings as soon as possible.

However, she had never expected Xia Xue’s next words to stun her.

Xia Xue told her everything that had happened.

Just as she had suspected, Xia Xue had taken the spot that belonged to Qiao Nian. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Although she had already guessed the truth, she was still very confused when she heard Xia Xue’s words.
