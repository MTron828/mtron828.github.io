1209 Missing Him

The man sitting on the left turned to look at Mr. Chen and asked in confusion, “Today is a good opportunity to acknowledge each other. Why didn’t you take the opportunity to acknowledge each other?”

Mr. Chen lowered his gaze and finally shook his head. “The time hasn’t come.”

The time had not come.

The man pursed his lips and hesitated for a moment before saying, “Although you say that, I think Gu Zhou is already starting to suspect you.”

When Mr. Chen heard this, his lips curved up involuntarily.

Actually, blood ties were a magical thing, and it was also the most difficult and precious thing in this world. Gu Zhou had actually sensed it long ago.

Mr. Chen also knew in his heart that he shouldn’t have come here because it was too dangerous.

Right now, he felt as if he was walking on a tightrope. If he fell, there would be mountains of knives and seas of flames waiting for him below.

However, it had been a long time since he had seen Gu Zhou.

He… he missed Gu Zhou a little.

He knew that Gu Zhou was not in good health, and that he had a cold personality.

Although he had heard from outsiders that Gu Zhou was much better, he still wanted to see Gu Zhou with his own eyes. Only then would he be truly at ease.

Gu Zhou looked much better than before. He could finally rest assured.

“Chang Feng.”

The man sitting on the left turned to look at Mr. Chen, revealing a cold face. His narrow eyes seemed to be filled with stars.

This person was none other than Qiao Nian’s missing Eldest Senior Brother, Chang Feng.

“Yes?”

Mr. Chen asked, “Then do you miss her?”

The light in Chang Feng’s eyes gradually disappeared. He shook his head gently and retracted his gaze, looking out of the window dejectedly.

He had watched his little junior sister grow up. He had not seen her for so many years. It would be a lie to say that he did not miss her.

However, he had personally sent Little Junior Sister to Gu Zhou’s side.

Previously, he stood in the dark and saw Little Junior Sister and Gu Zhou flirting with each other. Little Junior Sister’s face was filled with a bright smile. It seemed that she was living a very happy life.

He felt that he could die without regrets!

…

In the meeting room.

Qiao Nian told everyone that she had discovered that Mr. Chen’s bone age was only in his twenties.

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, his eyes were filled with surprise and a trace of excitement. He grabbed Qiao Nian’s hand and asked in shock, “Nian’er, are you sure?”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she nodded seriously and said, “I can guarantee that Mr. Chen’s real age is only in his twenties. Human skin can be changed, and it can hide one’s age. However, a person’s bone structure can’t be changed. The Mr. Chen we’re seeing should be in his twenties. He won’t be more than 32 years old!”

The other three looked at Qiao Nian in shock, remaining silent for a long time.

Qiao Nian continued, “The Mr. Chen we saw today is very likely an imposter. Or rather, the Mr. Chen we know has never been the real Mr. Chen.”

Gu Zhou frowned and said in disbelief, “What about the real Mr. Chen?”

Qiao Nian shook her head and said, “Perhaps he’s the real Mr. Chen. He just used a method to modify his age to hide his true age. His face…”

Qiao Nian paused for a moment and thought for a long time. She said, “His face doesn’t look like he had plastic surgery. Instead, it looks like he was born with it. I once heard from Grandpa that the ancestors of the Qin family had a disguise technique, but it has long been lost in history. What I can determine is that the face we saw shouldn’t be his real face.”

Gu Zhou asked, “Are you serious?”

“Yes, his face is too different from his age,” Qiao Nian said thoughtfully.

Gu Zhou pursed his lips. Mr. Chen’s every move when he smoked just now was similar to his brother’s, but on second thought, he couldn’t remember his brother’s actions.

It had been a long time since he had seen his brother. In the past, before his brother disappeared, he had some conflict with him because the two of them rarely contacted each other. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Perhaps he missed his brother too much and had mistaken him for someone else?
