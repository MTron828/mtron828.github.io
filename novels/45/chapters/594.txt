Chapter 595: Private Meeting

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Was Second Young Madam meeting Mr. Lu Zhu behind Second Young Master’s back?

If they were having an affair, Mr. Lu Zhu would not have brought a woman over.

Chen Qing pursed his lips. He had a bad feeling about this. He drove back to the Gu family villa.

In the study of the Gu family villa.

Gu Zhou sat in the study, his slender fingers gently stroking the snake’s head. His gaze, however, was fixed on the phone screen on the desk.

The phone screen showed a map of An City. There was also a small red dot on the map. The red dot was moving in the direction of the Gu family villa. This red dot was the location of Chen Qing’s phone.

Gu Zhou frowned. It seemed that Chen Qing had only sent Qiao Nian to the place before returning.

Just as Gu Zhou’s thoughts were running wild, there was a knock on the door.

“What is it?” Gu Zhou rarely let anyone into his study.

“Second Young Master, Little Master is sitting in the room in a daze. He doesn’t look well.”

The servant’s anxious voice came from outside the door.

Gu Zhou stood up and walked towards the door. He looked at the servant standing at the side. “Didn’t he rest after lunch?” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Little Master was resting at first, but for some reason, he got up and sat at the desk in a daze. Should we get a doctor to take a look at him?” The servant asked carefully.

Initially, Second Young Madam had been taking care of Young Master’s health. Now that Second Young Madam had just left, if they wanted to hire a doctor, they would have to hire a private doctor. Apart from the few masters in the family, the only person who could contact a private doctor was Chen Qing. However, Chen Qing was not around.

“I’ll go over and take a look.” The image of Gu Qi staring blankly ahead flashed in Gu Zhou’s mind, and his heart ached.

“Yes,” the servant replied and followed Gu Zhou towards Little Master’s ward.

When Gu Zhou entered Gu Qi’s ward, he saw Gu Qi sitting alone on a chair, his gaze fixed on the window.

Gu Zhou walked in and asked softly, “Little Qi, do you want to go out and play?”

Gu Qi did not speak. He just sat there calmly, as if he had not heard Gu Zhou’s words at all.

Gu Zhou reached out and touched Gu Qi’s forehead, then his own. Only then did he heave a sigh of relief. It seemed that Gu Qi did not have a fever.

… .

On the 16th floor of the Yongan Building.

As soon as Qiao Nian entered, the beautiful young lady at the front desk immediately greeted her.

“Miss, you…”

Before the receptionist could finish her sentence, Lu Zhu’s voice came from behind Qiao Nian. “Bring three cups of tea to my office.”

The receptionist immediately smiled and left.

“Zhu…” Qiao Nian said with a smile. She turned around and saw Lu Zhu walking in with an unfamiliar woman. She swallowed the greeting.

“Nian Nian, let’s go. I’ll bring you to my office.” As Lu Zhu spoke, he gestured for Qiao Nian to walk towards the office. He didn’t forget to introduce the young woman beside him to Qiao Nian. “This is Gu Qing. She’s very knowledgeable in psychology. She’s my junior sister.”

Only then did Qiao Nian realize that Gu Qing was a psychiatrist Lu Zhu had specially hired for her. The reason why Brother didn’t call her “Sugar” was probably to protect her identity.

“Hello Doctor Gu. I’m Qiao Nian.”

“Doctor Qiao, I’ve heard a lot about you.” Gu Qing reached out to Qiao Nian.

The two of them shook hands.

As they spoke, everyone arrived at Lu Zhu’s office. After the three of them entered, Lu Zhu continued, “Nian Nian, if you have anything to ask, you can ask Junior Sister Gu.”

Gu Qing gave Lu Zhu a meaningful look. When she heard the words “Nian Nian”, she smiled at Qiao Nian and said, “Doctor Qiao, please sit!”

After the receptionist brought the tea in, she left. Lu Zhu said, “You guys continue chatting. I’ll wait next door.”

Seeing that Qiao Nian was hesitating to speak, Gu Qing couldn’t help but ask, “Doctor Qiao, what question do you want to ask?”

“I wanted to ask if three-year-olds get autism?”

“Of course they can. Some people are born with autism, while others develop it. Even a three-year-old child might get autism.”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Qing’s words, her brow furrowed deeper and deeper. “What will happen if a child suffers from autism?”

“He doesn’t speak. He just stares blankly into space, completely ignoring everything else in the outside world.”
