Chapter 710: Sulphuric Acid

Qiao Nian frowned slightly. She could vaguely smell a pungent smell. She looked at the drop of liquid nervously.

In the next moment, the pungent smell grew stronger and stronger. Qiao Nian hurriedly pulled Lu Qi behind her and covered her mouth and nose.

Lu Qi was so frightened that her face turned pale. She covered her mouth and nose and looked at Qiao Nian in confusion. “Sister Nian Nian, what’s going on?”

When the others heard Lu Qi’s voice, they also leaned over.

Matriarch Lu was sitting quite far away. At this moment, she could also smell a strange smell in the air. Her gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face, and her gaze was much gentler than before. She asked, “What is this smell?”

She remembered very clearly that when she got the blessing bag, she had smelled a fragrance, but why had it become a pungent smell now?

Qiao Nian let go of Lu Qi’s hand and walked over. The pungent smell grew stronger and stronger. She covered her mouth and nose and saw with her own eyes that the drop of liquid had corroded the urn.

“It should be diluted sulfuric acid.” Qiao Nian said to the others, “Everyone, walk to the door. It’s highly corrosive and oxidizing. Its smell is very pungent. If you inhale too much sulfuric acid steam, your respiratory tract might feel uncomfortable. If the concentration of sulfuric acid is higher, it might cause other respiratory problems.”

“What?” Lu Qi was stunned. She had wanted to wipe off the drop of liquid just now. If her hand touched it, it might corrode her hand like the urn.

Lu Qi shivered in fear.

Matriarch Lu raised her hand and patted Lu Zhu’s arm. “Quick, go over and remove the blessing bag!”

As soon as Matriarch Lu finished speaking, another drop of sulfuric acid fell on the urn.

The hole in the urn widened.

Lu Qi was so anxious that she was about to cry. “Sister Nian Nian, my sister’s urn is corroded. Will her ashes…”

Matriarch Lu’s expression changed drastically. She stood up and walked towards the urn.

Qiao Nian didn’t have time to explain to them. Holding her breath, she realized that the lower half of the blessing bag was already wet. Instead of touching it, she untied the rope on it and walked out with it. Everyone immediately made way for her, and she threw the blessing bag to the ground.

The air was circulating better outside, and the pungent smell was much less pungent than before.

When she returned to her room again and saw the changes in the surface of the urn, she understood.

Song Yu frowned slightly, and there was a hint of anger in her beautiful eyes. She said coldly, “Who exactly added sulfuric acid to the blessing bag? Do you want my sister to be in trouble underground?”

Qiao Nian’s expression turned serious. She didn’t know who was so vicious as to attack an urn.

How much did this person hate the eldest daughter of the Lu family?

Suddenly, a glint flashed across Qiao Nian’s eyes.

Could it be those people?

But that wasn’t right either.

If those people really thought that the eldest daughter of the Lu family was already dead, why did they still damage the urn?

If those people knew that the eldest daughter of the Lu family was still alive, they would probably warn her directly.

“Oh my god, who is so ruthless to attack my eldest granddaughter!” Matriarch Lu looked sad. Her gaze landed on Lu Zhu’s face and she said, “We have to investigate this matter thoroughly. We can’t let Nian Nian suffer again.”

Nian Nian.

When Qiao Nian heard Matriarch Lu’s words, she paused. She hadn’t expected Grandma to believe her!

Lu Qi nodded in agreement and said, “Brother, I’ll help you investigate. We can’t let the person who bullied Sister go unpunished!”

Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. Since Grandma and Lu Qi trusted her so much, she had to find the culprit.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian picked up the scissors from the table beside her and walked out, carefully cutting open the pouch. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Originally, there were many dried flowers in the blessing bag. Now, these dried flowers had already been corroded by sulfuric acid and emitted a strong stench.

There was also a huge hole in the blessing bag.
