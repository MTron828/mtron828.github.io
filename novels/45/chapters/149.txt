Chapter 150 The First Lecturer

Qiao Nian was extremely glad that she had nothing to do with the Qiao family.

Fortunately, she now knew the truth.

Gu Zhou called out to her.

Qiao Nian smiled brightly at Gu Zhou. Her red lips parted slightly as she spoke. “You’re right. I shouldn’t have to tolerate this anymore. I should get back at them for what they did to me, and charge interest for it as well.”

Gu Zhou looked at her. There was a strange light in her eyes, and she looked much brighter and happier. The lights cast her in a golden glow, making her look so beautiful that one could not take their eyes off her. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Gu Zhou was momentarily dazed.

At this moment, the host of the banquet began to announce the order of guest speakers at the ceremony.

When everyone heard Qiao Nian’s name announced first, they were all extremely displeased.

“Who’s Qiao Nian? Why haven’t I heard of her name? What right does she have to go on stage to give a speech?”

“Where did this country bumpkin come from? Why haven’t I heard of her?”

“I’ve never heard of her either. She must have gotten in through the back door. Can any Tom, Dick, or Harry become a lecturer these days?”

“I want to see the eldest daughter of the Gu family giving her speech!”

“I’m here because of Miss Jiang Yue. I heard that she’s the first lecturer.”

“She initially took the first spot, but the order was changed afterwards.”

Because Qiao Nian had taken over Jiang Yue’s role as the first to go on stage, everyone present felt indignant for Jiang Yue.

When Gu Zhou heard their words, he couldn’t help but frown. Lin Tao walked around the venue. Listening to the words of those people, she was so angry that her little face turned red with rage. She complained unhappily, “Those people really know nothing. They’re so snobbish. All of them are blind fools.”

After complaining, Lin Tao reached out and took Qiao Nian’s hand, comforting her gently, “Nian Nian, don’t stoop to their level. They’re just too stupid.”

When Qiao Nian heard Lin Tao’s words, she couldn’t help but smile. She shook her head lightly.

At this moment, there was a commotion at the door.

Qiao Nian and Lin Tao looked over.

They saw Jiang Yue walking into the room in high heels. Her chin was raised proudly, her eyes glittering. She strode into the room elegantly. Lin Tao sized up Jiang Yue, frowning slightly. She couldn’t help but say, “Nian Nian, who is this? Does she think she’s a celebrity? Does she think that she’s going to walk the red carpet?” When Qiao Nian heard Lin Tao’s words, she couldn’t help but laugh. She explained, “That’s Jiang Yue.”

“What? She’s Jiang Yue? She’s so snobbish!” As Lin Tao spoke, she couldn’t help but glance at Jiang Yue again, inhaling sharply. “Are those people blind? How dare they claim that she’s a beauty, and a top student too? Perhaps if she’s a top student in the animal kingdom, I can accept that. After all, she’s just like a peacock.”

Lin Tao’s gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face. Puzzled, she asked, “Isn’t she your younger sister? Why didn’t she come with you?”

“She’s not,” Gu Zhou said indifferently, not even sparing Lin Tao a glance.

Qiao Nian realized that Gu Zhou didn’t seem to like Jiang Yue.

Lin Tao didn’t sense Gu Zhou’s displeasure at all. She went straight to the point. “Didn’t they all say that she’s the oldest daughter of the Gu family?”

“She’s just my grandmother’s adopted granddaughter. She has nothing to do with the Gu family.” Gu Zhou’s brow furrowed deeper and deeper. He seemed to be extremely displeased that others had labeled Jiang Yue as a member of the Gu family. It was as though he was trying his best to distance himself from Jiang Yue.

Only then did Qiao Nian realize that outsiders all thought that Jiang Yue was the precious daughter of the Gu family.

Jiang Yue’s gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face, and the smile in her eyes grew more pronounced. But when her gaze fell on Qiao Nian, who was standing beside Gu Zhou, something flashed in her eyes, then disappeared.

Jiang Yue had been notified yesterday that she was no longer the first to speak. Later on, she heard from others that Qiao Nian had replaced her as the first speaker.

Jiang Yue had never expected Qiao Nian to replace her as the first speaker. She was such a dubious character.

She had been trying hard to calm herself down, but Qiao Nian’s appearance next to Gu Zhou had ruined her composure.
