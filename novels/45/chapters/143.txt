Chapter 144 Showing off

“That’s more like it. Alright, I’ve already taken the measurements I need.” As Matriarch Gu spoke, she jotted down all the data she had measured.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Matriarch Gu’s face, and her heart warmed. However, she was still very worried about Matriarch Gu’s health. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Grandma, the speech will be in five days. If you plan on making me a new gown, time will be rather tight, and I’m afraid your health won’t be able to take it. If you’re even a little unwell, let me know at once, okay?”

Qiao Nian smiled at Matriarch Gu. She couldn’t bear to reject Matriarch Gu’s good intentions.

When Matriarch Gu heard Qiao Nian’s words, she smiled so wide that her eyes nearly disappeared. “My darling child, you’re Grandma’s favorite!”

“I’ll make some herbal soup for you.” Qiao Nian smiled gently at Matriarch Gu.

“Alright, don’t tire yourself out.” Matriarch Gu looked at Qiao Nian dotingly.

After Qiao Nian left Matriarch Gu’s office, Zhao Qian helped Matriarch Gu lay out the fabric neatly.

With Qiao Nian’s measurements as a guide, Matriarch Gu began snipping the fabric excitedly.

“Grandma, after making Sister Jiang Yue’s evening gown, you’ll still have to make one for Second Sister-in-law. Will you be too tired? Why don’t I make Sister Jiang Yue’s gown for you?” Zhao Qian smiled at Matriarch Gu. Matriarch Gu looked at Zhao Qian with a smile and said, “I know you’re concerned for me. I’m not planning to make an evening gown for Jiang Yue. This one is for Nian Nian.” Zhao Qian’s eyes widened in disbelief. She looked at the small diamonds scattered about not far away. These diamonds were all cut from a large diamond as big as one’s palm. Puzzled, she asked, “Doesn’t Sister Jiang Yue like diamonds the most?’”

“Yes, I know, but I made these for Nian Nian.”

Zhao Qian recalled in shock that these small diamonds were originally one palm-sized diamond. Under the sunlight, it would reflect multicolored light, highlighting its lustrous beauty. It was truly a priceless treasure.

Back then, when Jiang Yue had seen this diamond, she had even specially expressed her liking for it. That was why Zhao Qian thought that Matriarch Gu was helping Jiang Yue make an evening gown. Jiang Yue would also be attending that lecture.

“Grandma, you’re the best. Second Sister-in-law was especially touched just now!” Zhao Qian smiled, even as a trace of worry flashed in her eyes. If Jiang Yue knew about this, she might be unhappy.

Zhao Qian’s words pleased Matriarch Gu, who was smiling

At this moment, in a cafe.

Jiang Yue took a leisurely sip of her coffee, then put her cup back onto the saucer. She smiled at the woman across from her. “I’m really looking forward to the speech.”

“Goodness, is the diamond you’re talking about really the size of a palm? Any diamond that large must look absolutely stunning. Gosh, your grandmother is so good to you. I’ve never seen such a beautiful diamond in my life. Are you really going to wear that diamond to the speech?” Liu Yu looked at Jiang Yue excitedly.

Jiang Yue gave an unruffled smile and said, “I believe that when you see it, you won’t be able to resist its charm.”

“Jiang Yue, your grandmother really dotes on you. She was willing to buy you such a large diamond, and is even personally designing a gown for you. Goodness, how is your grandmother so nice? I want such a high-quality gown too.”

Jiang Yue smiled, not taking Liu Yu’s words to heart.

She had long been used to it. Her grandmother had always treated her very well. All the evening gowns she had worn in the past had been specially made for her by her grandmother, so this was already a common occurrence for her.

“Actually, I don’t want Grandma to make a gown for me anymore.” Jiang Yue sighed softly and said with a pained expression, “Her health isn’t good. She should rest more, but every time I try to persuade her, she won’t listen. There’s nothing I can do.”

“Yue Yue, I’m sure Madam Gu knows of your filial piety. I’m still looking forward to that day. A gown made of expensive diamonds. It’ll look amazing!”

Jiang Yue pursed her lips and smiled. She really hadn’t expected Grandma to take out the diamond Jiang Yue had always liked, just in time for her graduation.

Jiang Yue had thought that Grandma might have forgotten about her because of Qiao Nian’s arrival. Now, it seemed that she was Grandma’s favorite granddaughter after all. Qiao Nian was just a granddaughter-in-law. Perhaps Grandma would chase Qiao Nian out
