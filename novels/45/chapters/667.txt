Chapter 668: Bloodline Is The Most Important

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Of course, Qiao Nian knew that Lu Nian was puzzled. She hurriedly said, “Actually, you’ve misunderstood Big Brother. He’s not the kind of person who would steal someone else’s woman at all. He just feels sorry for me, so Brother Ah Nian, don’t think too much about it!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Lu Nian’s pupils involuntarily dilated as he looked at Qiao Nian in shock.

Could it be that Big Brother really acknowledged Qiao Nian as his sister?

Or was this just Big Brother’s first move?

Lu Nian’s expression instantly turned cold, and his expression turned uglier and uglier. If he wasn’t wrong, Big Brother should be using his brother-sister relationship with her to urge her to get a divorce.

When Sister Nian got a divorce, Big Brother could get together with her as a lover and get married.

Big Brother had really made a good move. He had tricked Qiao Nian.

First, he tricked him, then Second Brother. He was really capable.

Qiao Nian treated him like a brother, but his brother’s feelings for Qiao Nian were definitely more than just brother and sister.

If Big Brother treated Sister Qiao as his sister, he wouldn’t have scolded him for a god-sister.

Big Brother valued bloodline the most.

Lu Nian’s expression darkened. He looked at Lu Zhu sinisterly and questioned, “Brother, I understand your intentions. You just want to use your brotherhood to get close to Sister Nian. After Sister Nian gets a divorce, you can be with her!”

Qiao Nian felt a headache coming on. Her heart was beating faster and faster.

She had clearly explained it clearly. Why was Second Brother still misinterpreting it?

Lu Nian’s eyes turned cold as he said, “Sister Nian is my adopted sister. It has nothing to do with you! I won’t allow you to get close to her again!”

Qiao Nian had a headache initially, but when she heard Lu Nian’s words, she was a little touched.

Her eyes were a little red-rimmed.

Before she knew that she was a member of the Lu family, Second Brother had already treated her as his sister.

In Second Brother’s heart, she might really be his biological sister.

When Lu Zhu heard Lu Nian’s words, his amber eyes were slightly stunned, and there was a smile on his lips.

He really did not expect his brother, who had been single for so many years, to be so nervous about his adopted sister.

When Lu Zhu thought about how Lu Nian was the first to acknowledge his sister, he felt a little uncomfortable.

He still remembered that when he first met Qiao Nian, he didn’t have a good impression of the bold young lady who had been staring at him.

Lu Zhu felt that he had gone too far in the past.

His gaze fell on Lu Nian’s face again.

He remembered that Lu Nian and Sugar had been very close when he was young.

Fortunately, Lu Nian and Sugar were siblings. If it was really a relationship between a man and a woman, it would be troublesome!

Lu Zhu still wanted to hide Sugar’s identity and dote on her as her brother.

Previously, he had wanted Third Brother to acknowledge Sugar first. After all, Third Brother had almost fallen for Sugar.

But now, because Sugar’s death anniversary was approaching and Second Brother had been writing songs for her all night.

Forget it, let Second Brother and Sugar acknowledge each other first.

Lu Zhu stood up and walked to Lu Nian’s side. Seeing Lu Nian looking at him with a melancholic expression, he said, “Ah Nian, you’ve misunderstood. She’s not my adopted sister. She’s our biological sister to begin with.”

Lu Nian frowned and looked at Lu Zhu.

In order to get Qiao Nian, Big Brother had already begun to lie.

His parents had adopted Song Yu, but his brother was especially old-fashioned. He usually said that Song Yu was not their sister as Song Yu did not have the bloodline of the Lu family at all.

Therefore, other than Lu Qi, only their mother cared about Song Yu.

Song Yu’s status at home was very awkward because the brothers did not take her seriously.

Big Brother really loved Qiao Nian dearly. How could he say such things against his conscience?

Lu Nian felt that he had to wake his brother up.

“Brother, you previously said that the bloodline of the Lu family is very important. You’ve never acknowledged a god-sister before. Even Song Yu is just a relative, right?” Lu Nian questioned.
