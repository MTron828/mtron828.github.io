Chapter 1857: Sad

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

After Song Yu finished speaking, her face turned pale. She turned to look at Qiao Nian and said with a trembling voice, “I’m really living in the Lu family on behalf of Sister. I…

Seeing Song Yu blaming herself, Qiao Nian hurriedly comforted her. “Yu’er, actually, this has nothing to do with you. You don’t have to blame yourself for this. It’s all their fault.’

Lu Zhu lowered his gaze slightly and continued, “Yu’er, it’s fine if you withdraw now.”

“There’s no need, Brother. I want to help my family find that bad person.” The siblings began their plan in the study.

Auntie Cao saw that Song Yu’s expression was getting uglier and uglier. She handed Song Yu a bowl of chicken soup and said worriedly, “I told you that they don’t treat you as a family at all. You’re already so sick. They’ve never thought of treating you.”

“Auntie Cao, I told you not to say that again.” Song Yu looked up at Auntie Cao, her heart filled with sorrow. She didn’t understand why Auntie Cao wanted to harm her family. Everyone clearly treated her like a family member.

“Sixth Miss, they really don’t care about you. Ever since Eldest Miss returned, they’ve all treated you badly and don’t like you. You’re still stupid enough to speak up for them. Humans always put blood ties first,” Auntie Cao said with emotion.

In the next three days, as the conflict between Qiao Nian and Song Yu gradually deepened, Song Yu dragged her suitcase to her apartment to rest.

Seeing this, Auntie Cao hurriedly followed, saying that she wanted to take care of Sixth Miss.

That night, after Song Yu fell asleep, Auntie Cao took out her phone and made a call.

“She’s already fallen out with the Lu family. Do you want me to bring her to see you?” Auntie Cao said carefully.

There was a slight pause on the other end of the line, then he said, “In that case, bring her over. Just say that you want to discuss a collaboration.”

The next morning, Song Yu was sitting at the dining table eating breakfast.

Auntie Cao handed her phone to Song Yu with a pale face and said anxiously,

“Sixth Miss, take a look. You just ran away from home in a rage, and the Lu family has already begun to expose negative news about you and the video of you being raped.” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The spoon in Song Yu’s hand fell to the ground with a plop, then shattered into countless pieces. Her face was pale, and her body swayed. “How could this be? Impossible. My brothers wouldn’t treat me like this. In the past, when everyone was angry, they wouldn’t…”

“My Sixth Miss, at a time like this, why are you still thinking that they’re your brothers? When you were in the Lu family, there were only Eldest Miss’s favorite dishes at the dining table. Master and Madam even gave Eldest Miss a lot of gold, silver, and jewelry. I heard that there were also many businesses given to her.” Auntie Cao really took advantage of every opportunity and did not miss any opportunity to slander the Lu family. “You embarrassed Eldest Miss yesterday. How can they let you off?”

Song Yu’s tears fell one by one. She said pitifully, “Then what should I do? My greatest dream is to be a good actress. Now, someone has used an Al face-changer to impersonate me. Now, I won’t be able to clear my name even if I jump into the Yellow River. My acting career might end like this.”

Song Yu leaned back in her chair dispiritedly. Her eyes were filled with pain and helplessness, like a doll whose soul had been sucked away and only its shell was left.

Auntie Cao hurriedly coaxed Song Yu and said in a low voice, “Sixth Miss, don’t be sad. I’ll take you to see someone!”

Song Yu’s clear eyes were moist. She looked at Auntie Cao in confusion.

Auntie Cao had long contacted them, which was why she had suggested that. Seeing that Song Yu had agreed, she hurriedly brought her to find that person.

Song Yu followed Auntie Cao to a villa in the suburbs. The villa was filled with the fragrance of flowers. The Chinese style of renovation made one feel as if they had transmigrated to ancient times.

The nanny opened the door and brought Auntie Cao and Song Yu in. When they arrived at the living room on the first floor, Song Yu saw a young and beautiful woman standing by the French window. The woman walked towards her with a smile..
