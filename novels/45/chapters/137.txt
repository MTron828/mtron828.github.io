Chapter 138 A Slap

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, her breath caught in her throat. In that instant, everything around her seemed to fade away. All she could see was Gu Zhou.

It was as if something had struck her heart, rippling through her body.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou’s tall and broad back. Other than her grandfather, he was the only man who had ever defended her like this.

Qiao Nian wasn’t the only one who was stunned. Qiao Shan and his family of three were also shocked.

Qiao Shan looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief. He didn’t know what kind of drug Qiao Nian had given Gu Zhou to make him be so loyal to her.

The corners of Chen Qing’s mouth couldn’t help but curve up. He flexed his muscles. He had wanted to beat up those members of the Qiao family for a long time, but he hadn’t dared to act rashly. These people from the Qiao family were simply scum. They belonged to the dregs of society. Their very existence was a waste of space, and their lives were merely a waste of oxygen.

However, before Chen Qing could make a move, Gu Zhou stopped him. “Wait.”

Chen Qing looked at Gu Zhou in confusion.

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. He said, “You should do it. Get your dignity back!”

Chen Qing gave a small sigh. It was truly a pity that such a good opportunity did not fall into his lap. His Second Young Master was truly treating him better and better. He wouldn’t let Chen Qing do any work.

He would even pay Chen Qing a salary every month. As Second Young Master’s bodyguard, he really wanted to do something for Second Young Master, or at least contribute in some way. Unfortunately, he did not have the chance to do so.

At this moment, Qiao Shan was dumbfounded. He looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief.

Did Gu Zhou want Qiao Nian to hit him personally? It was simply unforgivable for a daughter to strike her father. The heavens would not accept it! She would be struck by lightning!

Gu Zhou was clearly trampling on the Qiao family’s dignity.

If Qiao Nian hit him, he would be utterly humiliated. How would he continue living in An City?

Gu Zhou was trying to ruin him!

Before Qiao Nian did anything, Su Xue was already trembling in fear. She could already sense the impression of Qiao Nian’s slap on her face.

She, Su Xue, had held her head high her entire life. She had never faced any obstacles in getting what she wanted, her entire life. Never had she been wronged so badly!

Qiao Xin’s eyes were as red as a rabbit’s. Her gaze fell on Qiao Shan and Su Xue’s pale faces. She bit her lip, the anger in her eyes obvious.

All of this was Qiao Nian’s fault!

It was Qiao Nian who sided with outsiders instead of their family. She gave away all of their family’s good things, and even squandered the family’s fortune!

How could Qiao Nian get Gu Zhou’s protection just by acting innocent? She didn’t deserve it at

all!

This wasn’t fair. This wasn’t fair at all!

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face, signaling for her to make a move. He exuded a suffocating aura, frightening everyone to the point where they didn’t dare to move.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face, and her heart gradually warmed. Heat flowed through her veins to every part of her body, and her entire body felt warmed from within.

Of course, Qiao Nian would never plead on behalf of the Qiao family. Moreover, she had been waiting so long for the opportunity to slap them!

The first person she wanted to hit was Su Xue.

In her high heels, Qiao Nian advanced towards Su Xue step by step.

Narrowing his phoenix eyes, Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian’s straightened back. A trace of approval flashed in his eyes.

The wife of Gu Zhou should indeed look like this.

Su Xue’s legs began to tremble involuntarily. Looking at Qiao Nian, who was getting closer and closer, her heart began to race.

Qiao Nian had already been violent with her when she had just returned home.

She was very certain that Qiao Nian would hit her!

Qiao Xin quickly walked up to Su Xue and shielded her behind her. She looked at Qiao Nian angrily and said angrily, “Qiao Nian, you can’t hit Mom. You’ll be struck by lightning. You…” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Pa!”

Qiao Nian gave Qiao Xin a resounding slap across the face. Since Qiao Xin wanted to protect Su Xue, then she would start with Qiao Xin!

Qiao Xin was dumbfounded. She was so shocked that she couldn’t speak.

Qiao Nian didn’t hold back at all. She had learned Taekwondo, so the strength behind her slap was immense. A purplish-green palm print appeared on Qiao Xin’s pale face.

Staring at Qiao Nian, Qiao Xin covered her cheek, her tears falling uncontrollably.
