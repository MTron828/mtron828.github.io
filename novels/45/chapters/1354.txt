1355 Heartache

Qiao Nian smiled at Xiao Shi in her arms and asked gently, “Does Xiao Shi like Li Tian a lot?”

Xiao Shi nodded and said happily, “Li Tian’s grades are also very good. She even knows how to dance. I’m so envious of her.”

“Xiao Shi, you can take the initiative to make friends with Li Tian,” Qiao Nian reminded her gently. Only now did she realize that Xiao Shi didn’t know how to make friends at all. “Friends just play happily together. Moreover, they don’t do anything immoral and criminal.”

Xiao Shi had never thought of making friends before. Although she greeted every student in her class, she preferred to talk to Li Tian. “I understand!”

“Yes, smart girl.” Qiao Nian smiled at Xiao Shi. She recalled how Xiao Shi had envied Li Tian. “Xiao Shi, do you want to learn how to dance like Li Tian?”

Xiao Shi’s eyes widened and her mouth fell open in disbelief. Her small mouth could fit an egg.

Qiao Nian reached out and patted Xiao Shi’s head. She asked gently, “What’s wrong? Why are you so surprised?”

“Mommy, can I learn how to dance?” Xiao Shi couldn’t believe what she was hearing and asked seriously again.

“Of course. If Xiao Shi wants to learn, we’ll hire a dance teacher.”

“Mommy, how can you be so amazing? Xiao Shi loves you the most!” As Xiao Shi spoke, she moved closer to Qiao Nian’s face and kissed her. When she smiled, her eyes curved into crescents.

Qiao Nian didn’t understand what Xiao Shi meant at all. She was just asking Xiao Shi if she wanted to learn how to dance. How was she amazing? She smiled and asked, “Xiao Shi, why did you say that Mommy is amazing?”

Xiao Shi said with a smile, “Previously, when I lived with Auntie Song, everyone said that dancing required a lot of money. Brother next door even said that even if he sold me, that money wouldn’t be enough to register for a dance class. Mommy and Daddy are so amazing. They can even let Xiao Shi learn to dance!”

She was especially happy when she said this, but it made Qiao Nian so sad that her eyes turned red.

Just because she said that Xiao Shi could learn to dance, Xiao Shi could not stop smiling.

Qiao Nian’s heart ached so much that she hugged Xiao Shi tightly. She closed her eyes and kissed Xiao Shi’s forehead. She rested her head on Xiao Shi’s head and said softly, “Xiao Shi, in the future, you don’t have to think about money. Mommy and Daddy will support you in learning all kinds of art classes and your dreams.”

“Mommy.” Xiao Shi grabbed the clothes in front of Qiao Nian with both hands. Song Man’s smiling face flashed in front of her eyes and she slowly closed her eyes. “Xiao Shi doesn’t want Mommy and Daddy to work hard to earn money. That way, Daddy and Mommy will be especially tired.”

Qiao Nian’s eyes turned red. She looked up at the ceiling and tried hard not to let her tears fall. She said gently, “Xiao Shi is very obedient, but you don’t have to worry about the world of adults. Studying is a good thing. It will benefit you for the rest of your life. Now I’m spending money so Xiao Shi can put in more time and effort studying, I believe Xiao Shi will become happier and more confident in the future. Mommy hopes that Xiao Shi will become a better Xiao Shi.”

“Mommy.”

“Yes?”

“I think I’m very happy, because Mommy will always support me!” Xiao Shi poked her head out of Qiao Nian’s arms and kissed her again.

Suppressing her tears, Qiao Nian said softly, “Alright, go and do your homework with your brothers. After you’re done, play for a while. When the time comes, Mommy will accompany you after the pills are done.”

“Okay.” Xiao Shi obediently got off Qiao Nian’s lap, stood on her tiptoes, picked up her school bag from the experiment table, and walked out with it.

Qiao Nian sent Xiao Shi to the door. Seeing Xiao Shi running happily towards the living room with her school bag, her eyes grew redder and redder.

She felt very guilty. Back then, she didn’t realize that her children had been swapped, nor did she find her children in time, causing Xiao Shi to suffer at such a young age. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

It wasn’t until Xiao Shi had disappeared down the corridor that Qiao Nian returned to the medicinal room and closed the door.

She tried hard to calm herself down. When she walked to the experiment table, her expression became complicated again.

Although Gu Zhou’s condition had stabilized, his illness was like a ticking time bomb. She didn’t know when it would explode. All she could do was treat his illness as soon as possible.
