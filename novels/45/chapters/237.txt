Chapter 238: Beautiful and Sassy

“You thief. Not only did you not apologize for stealing from me, but you even had the cheek to hit me?” Ye Ran panted heavily, her eyes burning with rage.

Qiao Nian looked at Ye Ran impatiently and said lightly, “Firstly, I didn’t steal anything from you. Secondly, your dirty hands touched my violin. I haven’t even settled the score with you!”

Qiao Nian retracted her gaze. It was as if her eyes would sting if she took another look at Ye Ran. She took out a wet tissue and carefully wiped the violin.

The other students in the class were all stunned. They felt that Qiao Nian was truly beautiful and valiant.

How could Qiao Nian be stealing?

For a moment, they didn’t know who to believe.

Ye Ran didn’t expect to be bullied by a country bumpkin. Exasperated, she walked forward and reached out to snatch the violin.

Giving such a good violin to a country bumpkin like Qiao Nian was simply a waste of the violin’s existence.

Moreover, only she was worthy of this violin.

However, before Ye Ran could get close to the violin, Qiao Nian kicked her away. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Ye Ran clutched her stomach and squatted on the ground in extreme pain. Tears welled up in her eyes.

She was the precious daughter of the Ye family. When had she ever suffered so much?

All this time, she had been the target of flattery.

Qiao Nian, this country bumpkin from nowhere, actually dared to go against her.

Not only had Qiao Nian stolen her tickets, but she had also dared to hit her. This was simply a heinous crime.

If she didn’t teach Qiao Nian a lesson, her name wouldn’t be Ye Ran.

Ye Ran looked at the lackeys who had helped her settle scores with Qiao Nian just now and shouted sternly, “Why are you still standing there like idiots? Hurry up and snatch the violin and the tickets over. Let me tell you, if you don’t cripple her, you won’t be able to get a ticket to Mr. Dong Hua’s concert in the future!”

Those people hesitated for a moment.

Seeing that they were hesitating, Ye Ran said angrily, “Don’t you want the tickets to Mr. Dong Hua’s concert?”

The few of them took a step back in fear. It had to be known that the school clearly forbade fighting. If they violated this rule, they would be expelled.

Ye Ran suddenly understood their concerns and shouted, “What are you afraid of? If anything happens, I’ll bear the consequences. Moreover, she was in the wrong in the first place.She was the one who attacked first! I’m only doing this in self-defense!”

When the three girls heard Ye Ran’s words, they looked at each other. Then, they thought of Mr. Dong Hua’s tickets, and threw themselves at Qiao Nian.

Seeing the three of them rush over, Qiao Nian casually picked up a chair and twirled it elegantly in her palm.

In Qiao Nian’s hands, the chair spun like a spinning top, blocking the three people’s attacks like a barrier.

The three of them hesitated for a moment. They looked at each other and rushed in.

In the end, the chair hit the legs of the three people, causing them to trip and fall to the ground. One by one, they clutched at their legs, howling in pain.

When the people around them saw this, they were all stunned.

Oh my god, Qiao Nian knew martial arts!

This was too cool. Their new classmate was both beautiful and valiant!

Oh my god, if she was a boy, I would definitely give birth to his child!

The three girls who had fallen to the ground were just trying to avenge Ye Ran, but at this moment, they felt utterly humiliated. They looked at Qiao Nian angrily.

“Qiao Nian, you b*tch. Today, either you die or I die!” One of the lackeys, Chen Xue, stood up. Her eyes were red. No matter how humiliated Ye Ran was, it had nothing to do with her. All she wanted to do now was regain her dignity!
