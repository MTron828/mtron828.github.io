Chapter 509: Child Bride?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Although she was very grateful to Qiao Yu for saving her previously, she could not tolerate deception.

Of course, Qiao Xin didn’t know about her past with Qiao Yu.

Now that Qiao Nian had told Lu Zhu all about her past, she felt the weight on her chest instantly disappear. She heaved a sigh of relief.

As Lu Zhu listened to Qiao Nian talk about the past, his frown deepened. Just hearing that she was going to fall off the cliff made him tremble in fear.

Fortunately, nothing had happened to Qiao Nian back then. Otherwise, Sugar would really have died. He wouldn’t have met Sugar today, let alone reunited with her.

Lu Zhu frowned and thought quickly. He said thoughtfully, “Did he really say that back then?”

“Yes.” Qiao Nian nodded and agreed. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Originally, she was too embarrassed to say such a thing. But now that she’d gotten over it, she didn’t think it mattered.

Lu Zhu narrowed his eyes slightly. After a while, he said thoughtfully, “Could it be that when Qiao Shan brought you back, he wanted you to be with Qiao Yu?”

The Qiao family actually treated his sister as a child bride!

How infuriating!

Lu Zhu tried his best to suppress the anger in his chest.

In those days, many people would look for a child bride.

One category was poor families. In those poor mountains, many families wanted sons. They would abandon their daughters when they gave birth because they were worried that they could not afford to raise them.

Some poor families had sons. They were worried that their sons would not be able to get a wife, so they would pick up some girls and bring them home. When both of them were adults, they could let the girls marry their sons. Raising one more daughter would also give them another person to do labor.

There were also rich families. Some families would be especially superstitious. They would find fortune-tellers and ask them to choose a suitable girl for their son as a child bride.

Not only did that girl have to match her son’s birth chart, but she also had to bring prosperity to her husband. Only then could their son soar into the sky and become a dragon among men.

Old Master Qiao lived in an era of war. At that time, the Qiao family was also a large corporation. Only when Qiao Shan’s generation arrived did the Qiao family slowly fall.

Thinking about it this way, the Qiao family was obviously the latter. They must have brought their sister back in this way back then in order to make her Qiao Yu’s wife.

If that was the case, Qiao Yu might have known from the beginning that Qiao Nian wasn’t his biological sister. That was why he had told Qiao Nian that they were a match made in heaven.

However, what Lu Zhu could not understand was that if that was the case, why did the Qiao family throw his sister into the mountains to fend for herself? Why did they not care about his sister all these years?

“Sugar, do you remember when they sent you to the mountains?”

Qiao Nian thought about it carefully and said, “I remember that not long after Grandma passed away, I was sent there. I think I celebrated my fifth birthday with Grandpa.”

A golden light flashed across Lu Zhu’s mind. He seemed to have grasped the key clue and asked directly, “How’s your relationship with Matriarch Qiao?”

“I still remember very clearly what happened when I was five years old. At that time, Grandma was still around. She was very good to me, much better than she was to Qiao Xin. Moreover, she even gave me a portion of the Qiao Corporation’s shares!”

Lu Zhu said thoughtfully, “In other words, after Matriarch Qiao passed away, Qiao Shan and his wife were very cold to you and sent you into the mountains?”

Hearing Lu Zhu’s words, Qiao Nian seemed to understand what he meant. She asked in disbelief, “Brother, do you think the reason why I ended up in the Qiao family has something to do with Grandma Qiao?”

Lu Zhu nodded and said, “As you said, when Matriarch Qiao was around, the Qiao family treated you very well. However, after Matriarch Qiao left, the Qiao family abandoned you in the mountains and ignored you. This can only mean one thing. The Qiao family doesn’t like you and doesn’t want you to stay in the Qiao family, but Matriarch Qiao wants you to live happily and stay in the Qiao family.”
