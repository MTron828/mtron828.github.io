1127 Hello, Eldest Miss!

Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou walked towards the cafe.

When they reached the entrance of the cafe, a mercenary stopped them. “Sirs, I’m really sorry. The entire place has been booked. Please go somewhere else!”

The leader of the mercenaries happened to walk out. When he saw Qiao Nian, his expression changed. He quickly walked up to her and saluted respectfully. “Hello, Eldest Miss! Young Master Qin is already waiting for you inside!”

When the soldier saw that his leader was respectful to that woman and heard him call her Eldest Miss, he realized that the woman in front of him was Young Master Qin’s sister, Qiao Nian. He was shocked and hurriedly bowed to Qiao Nian!

The soldier stammered, “I’m sorry, Eldest Miss. I…”

“It’s fine.” Qiao Nian nodded slightly at the soldier. Her attention fell on the mercenary leader’s face again!

“Da Dong, which private room are they in now?” Qiao Nian asked, saving her the trouble of calling Qin Chuan.

“Miss, I’ll lead the way for you now!” The mercenary leader led Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou in. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

At this moment, the soldier guarding the door still had lingering fears. So this was the legendary Eldest Miss. She was really good-looking!

Qiao Nian got into the elevator and looked at Da Dong worriedly. “What’s the situation now?”

“It’s safe inside for the time being!”

Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. As long as Lu Qi was fine.

However, Qiao Nian quickly calmed down. Thinking of the armed mercenaries at the entrance of the cafe, she frowned. “What happened at the entrance of the Venus Cafe today can’t be spread. Otherwise, it will cause panic!”

Da Dong nodded. “Okay, Eldest Miss!”

When the elevator stopped, Da Dong told Qiao Nian the number of the private room.

“Go ahead. I’ll go myself!”

“Okay, Eldest Miss!” With that, Leader Dong entered the elevator again and went downstairs!

Seeing the elevator door close, Gu Zhou narrowed his eyes and said thoughtfully, “If I’m not wrong, those mercenaries should be the strongest mercenaries in various places. The leader should be Zhao Dong from the Dragon Team!”

Qiao Nian walked towards the private room and nodded.

A trace of surprise flashed in Gu Zhou’s eyes. It had to be known that those famous mercenaries were all unwilling to submit to others. He had once heard of the Dragon Team’s mercenaries. In the past, this team of mercenaries had done many terrifying things. Later on, they hid their identities. He had thought that those mercenaries had already disbanded, but he didn’t expect them to be working for Qin Chuan and Qiao Nian now!

What surprised Gu Zhou the most was that those mercenaries respected Qiao Nian very much!

Gu Zhou held Qiao Nian’s hand tightly and said, “Nian’er, I now realize that you have more and more secrets!”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she said humbly, “They were originally by Grandpa’s side. Later on, Grandpa wanted to rest in peace, so he handed them over to Qin Chuan. They respected me only because I was on good terms with Grandpa and Qin Chuan!”

Gu Zhou smiled and did not say anything.

The Dragon Team was the number one mercenary team in the world!

All the mercenaries inside were well-known. Such a group of arrogant people definitely wouldn’t respect Qiao Nian just because of others.

However, there was a rule among the Dragon Team mercenaries, and that was that the strong were respected. Qiao Nian should have defeated them before, which was why they were sincerely convinced by her strength!

If he remembered correctly, Qiao Nian’s boxing skills were not bad either!

When Qiao Nian first came to the Gu family, she had easily caught the snake.

It seemed that Qiao Nian had many secrets!

Qiao Nian didn’t notice Gu Zhou’s probing gaze. She was now concerned about Lu Qi’s safety and couldn’t help but quicken her pace. “Let’s leave quickly!”

“Okay!”

When the two of them reached the door of the private room, Qiao Nian pushed it open.

The three people in the room looked at the door of the private room at the same time.

Lu Qi had been sitting beside Qin Chuan. When she saw Qiao Nian, she immediately stood up excitedly. “Sister!”
