Chapter 1733 - 1733 Threat

Wright calmly told the guards to leave. Via hurriedly closed the door and didn’t forget to lock it.

Wright looked at Via’s cowardly expression, his eyes filled with disdain. Then, he looked at Chen Qing, who was not far away.

Even if Chen Qing pointed a gun at him now, he would only suffer a little. Chen Qing did not dare to do anything to him. In his residence, Chen Qing would not be able to escape.

He had to kill Chen Qing.

Lina went to a nearby drawer, opened it, and took out a pen and paper, preparing to write with her good hand.

Via looked at Lina with heartache and said worriedly, “Seventh Princess, you’re still injured. Why don’t I write it?”

Without looking up, Lina said, “I can do such a small thing myself.”

She wrote something very seriously. Every sentence was written after careful consideration, not leaving any loopholes for Wright.

In the end, it took Lina half an hour to finish writing everything.

Wright sat cross-legged on the ground and stretched. He couldn’t help but yawn and say unhurriedly, “It’s getting late. We’ve been busy all night. Princess, shouldn’t you rest early?”

Before Lina could speak, Chen Qing stepped on the spot where Wright had been grazed by the bullet.

“Ah!” Wright cried out in pain, looking at Chen Qing unhappily.

Chen Qing frowned slightly. “Shut up. You’re so spoiled as a man. Why don’t I make you change your personality?”

Wright immediately shut up. He was in so much pain that he was sweating profusely. He glared at Chen Qing, who was not far away. If looks could kill, Chen Qing would have died a million times over.

“Chen Qing,” Wright said through gritted teeth. “Aren’t you afraid that I’ll kill you for treating me like this?”

“If I don’t treat you like this, will you not have the intention to kill me?” Chen Qing felt that Wright was like a fool. He snorted. “Shut up and stay there obediently. Moreover, you don’t have much strength left.”

Although Wright didn’t understand Chen Qing’s last sentence, he knew that Chen Qing definitely didn’t have anything good to say. Suppressing the pain, he turned to the side.

Via had bandaged Lina’s hand while she was writing. Now that she had already treated Lina’s injuries, she said sarcastically, “Prince Wright is knowledgeable. He must understand such simple logic.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she received a sinister look from Wright.

Via stiffened. It was over. She had gotten carried away. Silently, she moved behind Lina.

Sensing Wright’s gaze, Lina pulled over a stool and placed a pen and paper on it. She looked at Wright calmly. “Alright, get ready to sign!”

Wright looked at Lina’s cold face and silently turned away to look down at the contents of the paper.

Chen Qing had been standing beside Wright. Now, he was also looking down at the contents of the paper.

Wright quickly scanned the contents of the paper and gritted his teeth in anger. “Lina, do you want me to promise you that I won’t enter your room for the rest of my life?”

Lina tapped her fingers gently on the paper on the table and said calmly, “Why? Can’t you not read now? Can’t you understand the rest? Your subordinates can’t enter my room either. You can’t force me or Via to do anything.”

Lina crossed her arms and looked down at Wright. “As for what happened tonight, both sides will take a step back and pretend that it never happened.”𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

She had thought it through very clearly. Mark cared about his reputation the most. If Wright signed this piece of paper, and if Wright dared to use force, she would send out this contract. She would ruin Wright and Mark’s reputations.

The person Wright was most afraid of was Mark, and using Mark to threaten Wright was especially useful.

Chen Qing lowered his head and read the contents of the contract carefully. Lina had written everything very cleverly, not giving Wright any way out. Even the timing was written very clearly.

The duration was indefinite.

When he saw these words, Chen Qing glanced at Lina. When he first saw Lina, she was still a little princess that made one worry for her. Now, Lina had already learned to protect herself.

She had grown up.
