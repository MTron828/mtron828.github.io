Chapter 1756 - 1756 Blaming herself

No, she had to look for Lina. She could not let Lina be in danger alone.

Gu Zhou hurriedly grabbed Qiao Nian’s arm and pulled her to the sofa to sit down. He hugged Qiao Nian, who was about to lose control of her emotions.

His eyes moved slightly as he glanced at Chen Qing, who was sitting opposite him.

Chen Qing sat there with his head lowered as usual. He did not speak, but his clenched fists on his knees showed that Chen Qing was nervous about Lina.

Chen Qing seemed to notice Gu Zhou’s gaze. He looked up at Gu Zhou and asked seriously, “Is there any news from MY?”

He wished he could start the plan sooner. Only by helping the president take down Mark would Lina be safe.

He had not been in Europe for long. During this period of time, Mark and Wright’s men had been targeting Lina.

On the surface, Lina was the Seventh Princess of Europe, but in fact, she was just an innocent girl who could not even guarantee her own safety.

Now that Mark had something on Lina, how could he let Lina have it easy?T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

If only things could end sooner. Then Lina would never have to be threatened again.

Gu Zhou pursed his lips and said, “I haven’t contacted them recently, nor have they contacted us.”

Hearing Gu Zhou’s words, Chen Qing couldn’t help but lower his head. He pursed his lips tightly, his heart filled with sadness. He clenched his fists tightly.

Seeing Chen Qing like this, Gu Zhou said calmly, “Things are still under our control. You don’t have to be so anxious and nervous. Mark definitely won’t let Lina suffer.”

Hearing Gu Zhou’s words, Qiao Nian gradually regained her senses. She took a deep breath.

Gu Zhou was right. Now, they were in a mess because of their concern. What they should do now was to save Lina from Mark as soon as possible.

Qiao Nian glanced at Gu Zhou and Chen Qing before saying, “We originally wanted to catch Song Ling and use her to catch Mark off guard. Then, we would force Mark to rebel. However, the situation has changed. We have to think of another way.”

“Song Ling is dead?” Gu Zhou had heard Qiao Nian’s words through his earpiece.

Qiao Nian nodded. She couldn’t believe that Mark had killed Song Ling.

If it was really Mark who killed Song Ling, it meant that Mark didn’t have anyone he valued anymore.

Chen Qing frowned slightly and was even more worried about Lina. If Mark pushed Song Ling’s death to Lina, he was afraid…

Chen Qing did not dare to think further. He took a deep breath and tried his best to maintain his composure.

Gu Zhou said, “It’s useless for us to think too much now. Why don’t we rest up so that we can counter every move tomorrow?”

He looked at Chen Qing in front of him and said seriously, “You have to rest well too. You might be able to see the Seventh Princess tomorrow.”

When Chen Qing heard this, his eyes lit up. He looked up at Gu Zhou and nodded seriously.

The next morning.

At the palace.

The president stood in front of the fitting mirror in his suit, seriously adjusting his tie and suit. He walked to a table at the side and ate his breakfast slowly. At this moment, his phone rang.

It was his private phone. Not many people knew his phone number.

The president’s heart suddenly skipped a beat. He had a bad feeling. Frowning slightly, he picked up the phone and answered.

So it was Lina who called him.

The president heaved a sigh of relief and said with a smile, “Lina, you woke up early today.”

“If I don’t call you earlier, wouldn’t you have gone to the meeting?”

A deep male voice came from the phone. The voice was extremely familiar to the president.

It was Mark.

Could something have happened to Lina?
Otherwise, Lina’s phone wouldn’t have ended up in Mark’s hands.

At the thought of this, the President’s heart tightened. He gripped his cell phone tightly and said anxiously, “Where’s Lina? What are you going to do to Lina?”

“My dear brother, how could I hurt your daughter? I’m calling to tell you that you don’t have to go to the meeting today. Wait for me at home. I have something to tell you.”

Without waiting for the president to speak, Mark hung up.

The President looked at his cell phone and frowned even more.
