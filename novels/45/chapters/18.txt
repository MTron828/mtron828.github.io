Chapter 19: Doesn’t He Despise Her?

Gu Zhou said coldly, “Woman, did you think that doing that would attract my attention? You’re too naive!” Then, he turned around to leave.

Qiao Nian had never expected Gu Zhou to tear the contract in half.

However, this was not an obstacle. Out of habit, she had prepared two copies beforehand. She handed the other copy to Gu Zhou and said, “There’s one more!”

Gu Zhou looked at her with contempt. His voice was cold as he said impassively, “From now on, don’t mention this again. Treat your role as Second Young Madam with respect!”

Qiao Nian was even more confused.

Gu Zhou couldn’t be bothered to say another word to Qiao Nian. He turned around and walked into the bathroom, leaving Qiao Nian alone.

Qiao Nian gazed at Gu Zhou’s retreating back. The expression in her eyes grew more and more tense. She felt that there must be something wrong with Gu Zhou. He clearly didn’t like her. Was he forcing her to stay in the Gu family solely because of her medical skills?

But that wasn’t right either. Gu Zhou didn’t seem to be willing to let her treat his illness.

Qiao Nian couldn’t figure it out, and could no longer be bothered to think about it. Instead, she found herself in a dilemma over where she should sleep tonight.

When Gu Zhou came out of the bathroom, he saw Qiao Nian sitting on the sofa. He raised his eyebrows slightly. With smiling eyes, he said unhurriedly, “Aren’t you going to go to bed?”

“I think Grandma should already be asleep by now. I’ll sleep next door!” Qiao Nian replied with a smile, her gaze landing on Gu Zhou’s face.

“Just sleep on my bed. I have an errand to run tonight, so I’ll be heading out.” With that, Gu Zhou turned around and stepped into the coatroom.

Qiao Nian was stunned. He didn’t despise her?

Suppressing her astonishment, Qiao Nian spoke. “My sister asked me when the owner of the jade pendant would return. She’ll also be staying the night.”

Upon hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Gu Zhou’s expression froze for a moment. After a brief pause, he replied, “He’s back, but something cropped up with a project he’s handling. He’ll come by once the matter is settled.”

“Okay, got it.” Qiao Nian saw Gu Zhou to the door. She was about to shut the door when she heard Gu Zhou speak.

“You seem to be very concerned about this matter.” Gu Zhou stared hard at Qiao Nian, scrutinizing her expression. He was hoping to see something from her reaction. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Qiao Nian pursed her lips, giving a faint smile. Her expression remained calm as she replied, “I just want her to leave as soon as possible. I get irritated whenever I see her.”

“Is that all?” Gu Zhou’s eyes turned cold as he continued, “When she appeared with the jade pendant, your reaction was abnormal. I even thought the jade pendant was yours!”

As Gu Zhou finished speaking, he saw that Qiao Nian’s hands were tightly clenched into fists. A faint smile appeared on his face as he looked calmly at Qiao Nian. Indeed, Qiao Nian must have had something to do with the jade pendant.

“I just don’t like her. It’s nothing more than that.” Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou and continued, “She forced me to marry into this family for her. I just wanted to humiliate her, that’s all!”

Gu Zhou gave Qiao Nian a meaningful look and said nothing more.

Qiao Nian swiftly closed the door. Her heart, which had been in her throat, gradually settled back down. She still wasn’t entirely clear on what had happened five years ago. She couldn’t alert the enemy unnecessarily.

What surprised Qiao Nian was that Gu Zhou was willing to let her sleep on his bed.

However, Qiao Nian still decided to return to her guest room. She was a sensible person.

Qiao Nian waited in the room for a while, then walked to the guest room next door.

At this moment, her phone suddenly began to ring. Old A had sent her a text.

“Someone wants to investigate you. As per your instructions, I’ve already prepared a copy of your information!”

“Thank you.” Qiao Nian sent a text in reply.

“However, that person asked a really specific question.”

“What question?” Qiao Nian frowned.

“He asked if you’ve ever given birth, and if you did, where the baby had gone.”

Looking at the message from Old A, Qiao Nian’s hand began to tremble slightly. Her gaze lowered, a tinge of heartache appearing in her eyes.

Four years ago, she was forced to give birth, but the child had died the moment it was born.

Old A sent another text, perhaps because Qiao Nian had not replied for a long time. “That person offered a high price.”

“How high?” Qiao Nian asked.

“A hundred million.”

Reading Old A’s reply, Qiao Nian narrowed her eyes. She couldn’t help but feel tempted. “Who’s the one investigating?”

“Gu Zhou!”

Qiao Nian pushed open the door to the guest room and walked in, then sat down dejectedly. She could still remember the pain and sorrow from the night she gave birth, with utmost clarity. The only thing she couldn’t recall was the child she gave birth to.

“Okay, I’ll send you the information later.” After Qiao Nian replied, she threw her phone aside. She lowered her gaze slightly, her lips curving up.

Since Gu Zhou suspected her, she would give him the truth. That way, Gu Zhou would likely get a divorce with her very soon.

Qiao Nian wrote down the birth date of her child, and sent it to Old A.

After receiving a reply from Old A, Qiao Nian quietly deleted all the chat records. Then, she turned off her phone to get ready for bed.

The next morning, Qiao Nian was woken up by a knock on the door. She went to open the door with a sullen expression and her gaze landed on that woman’s face.. Before she could say anything, the woman began to scream as if she were a pig being slaughtered.
