At this moment, Zhao Qian walked over. She glanced at Li Yuan, then at Qiao

Nian, asking worriedly, “Sister, are you okay?”

“I’m fine.”As Qjao Nian spoke, her phone began to ring. Seeing that it was Su

Kiao calling, Qiao Nian got ready to leave the restaurant to answer the call.

“‘Stop right there!” Li Yuan pushed Li Kun away and stood directly in Qiao

Nian’s path. “You’re paying for this meal!”

Qiao Nian stood there in silence. She looked at Li Yuan calmly, as if she was

looking at a pile of shit.

Li Yuan sensed the disdain in Qiao Nian’s gaze and raised his hand in anger,

preparing to hit her.

Qiao Nian grabbed Li Yuan’s hand. In a burst of strength, she dislocated his

hand as she pushed him away, taking the opportunity to slap him hard as well.

Li Yuan’s hand and face ached terribly. He looked at Qiao Nian in a rage. If

looks could kill, Qjao Nian would have died a thousand times over. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“How dare you hit me? I’m telling you, I’ll kill you right now!” Lee Yuan

threatened her without hesitation.

Qiao Nian picked up a wet towel from the table and elegantly wiped her hands

clean. With a disdainful expression, she said, “You look down on women just because you have a few dollars. All you do is keep insisting that they become

full-time housewives for you. You even say that your wife’s money should

belong to you. Is your brain filled with shit? You’re so fat. Is whatever you have

between your legs no longer functional? You should go to the hospital to treat

your impotence first.”

Li Yuan’s face was now flushed red with embarrassment. He did not expect this

woman to immediately discover his impotence. However, he was still in

public, so he had to continue pretending no matter what. He snapped, “You’re

talking nonsense!

Li Kun stood at the side. Looking at Qiao Nian’s valiant and charming figure,

his heart began to race.

Seeing that Qiao Nian was leaving, he hurriedly chased after her. “Miss Qjao.”

Qiao Nian was about to pick up the phone when she heard Li Kun’s voice. She

turned around and saw that Li Kun and Zhao Qian had both stepped out of the

restaurant.

Qiao Nian was no fool. Li Kun and Zhao Qian were supposed to have a blind

date today, but there was something wrong with the way Li Kun was looking at

her. He seemed to have taken a liking to her.

Then, wouldn’t she ruin Zhao Qian’s good fortune?

As she thought about this, Qjao Nian’s frown deepened. She looked coldly at Li

Kun and asked, “Mr. Li, can I help you?”

Li Kun also sensed that Qiao Nian was distancing herself from him. Thinking

that Qjao Nian was trying to make boundaries clear because of his Third Uncle,

he hurriedly said in an ingratiating manner, “Miss Qjao, my Third Uncle is

someone who will seek revenge for the smallest grievance. Why don’t I send

you back?

Under the sunlight, Li Kun had a faint smile on his face, making one feel as

warm as the summer wind.

There’s no need,” Qiao Nian said indifferently. She was about to hail a taxi

when she saw a car stop in front of her.

Chen Qing?

Why was he here?

After Chen Qing got out of the car, he walked to the back seat and opened the

door for Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian got in.

After closing the car door, Chen Qing turned to look at Zhao Qian. Smiling, he

asked, “Miss Zhao, would you like to return home with us?”

Zhao Qian looked at the door of Chen Qing’s car, which was already closed. Her

lips spasmed. Chen Qjng had clearly never intended for her to get in the car.

“Then we’ll leave first.” Without waiting for Zhao Qjan to reply, Chen Qing

began to walk towards the driver’s seat.

Zhao Qjan watched as the car drove off. She stood by the side of the road, her

mind in a mess.

For as long as she could remember, her second brother had never once asked

Chen Qing to specially pick her up.

Li Kun looked at the car and frowned slightly, thinking of the young man who

had just gotten out of the car. “Miss Zhao, was that Chen Qing?”

Gu Zhou rarely went out, but Chen Qing often did. In public, Chen Qing

represented Gu Zhou..
