Chapter 399: My Shoulder Hurts!

After Qiao Nian returned from the charity auction, she had asked Gu Zhou to invite Grandma over for candy. She had also told Gu Zhou not to let Grandma come over no matter what Jiang Yue said later.

Since Jiang Yue dared to scheme against her tonight, she would suffer the consequences. She was not the kind of person who would swallow her grievances.

In the past, on account of her grandmother, she couldn’t be bothered to argue with Jiang Yue.

However, this time, Jiang Yue had really gone too far. She actually dared to plot against her innocence. Then, Jiang Yue would lose everything that was most important to her.

Previously, Qiao Nian had been worried that Gu Zhou would be unwilling, but she hadn’t expected him to agree so readily.

Then again, it made sense. This scene wasn’t just about her. It was also about her grandmother.

However, she still thanked Gu Zhou.

After that, Gu Zhou invited Grandma to the second floor of the ancestral hall. Then, it was Jiang Yue’s turn to suffer.

However, what puzzled Qiao Nian was why Gu Zhou had brought this up again.

Gu Zhou looked at her beautiful fox eyes that were filled with confusion, and his throat involuntarily moved. “You seem to have forgotten what I told you before.”

“What?” Qiao Nian didn’t understand what Gu Zhou was talking about. Had he said many things in the past?

Gu Zhou walked forward and approached Qiao Nian. His eyes were deep as he pulled Qiao Nian into his arms and looked at her with a burning gaze. “I’ve told you before not to thank me…”

Qiao Nian’s heart couldn’t help but race. The tip of her nose was filled with Gu Zhou’s pleasant scent. She wasn’t used to him being so close to her.

Qiao Nian struggled to leave, but Gu Zhou was too strong for her to break free.

Just as Qiao Nian was about to question him, Gu Zhou rested his chin on her shoulder.

He leaned close to Qiao Nian’s ear and asked softly, “Shouldn’t you show some sincerity, hmm?”

The tone of the last word in his words rose slightly, with a hint of ambiguity. That voice was like clear spring water, and her pupils involuntarily widened.

Qiao Nian’s breathing tightened, and her pupils involuntarily widened.

Well…

This voice…

How was that possible?

Qiao Nian’s heart beat faster and faster, as if it was about to jump out of her chest in the next second.

The man’s hot breath hit her neck, and a numbing sensation instantly spread throughout her body.

Why did his voice sound a little like the man from five years ago?

The only difference was that the man’s voice from five years ago was a little hoarse, and his voice was a little clearer.

Gu Zhou was too close to her. At this distance, Qiao Nian felt very insecure.

Qiao Nian wanted to escape from this ambiguous position. She tried her best to adjust her mental state and asked, “How do you want me to show my sincerity?”

The unique scent of a man wafted into Qiao Nian’s nose. This scent made her infatuated.

She took a tentative step back, but Gu Zhou’s grip was too strong, not allowing her to take half a step back.

“Don’t move!”

He seemed to be giving her an order, but his drawl made her feel a sense of anticipation.

Qiao Nian stood there quietly.

She rested her head against his chest. She could hear his strong heartbeat.

Qiao Nian felt that the atmosphere was a little strange. She opened her mouth slightly. “Well…”

“My shoulder hurts!”

Both of them spoke almost simultaneously.

With that, Gu Zhou let go of Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou and met his deep, emotionless eyes. She suggested, “Go back. I’ll help you massage it!”

“Okay.”

Qiao Nian was speechless.

This man agreed so readily. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Afterward, the two of them returned to their room.

Qiao Nian closed the door and turned around. She saw that Gu Zhou had already taken off his suit and was unbuttoning his shirt.
