1317 Explanation

Cui Huai’s heart sank. Although he didn’t like the way Chen Quan was looking at him, he had misunderstood Chen Quan just now. Now, he could only try to explain the situation.

He thought for a while before saying, “Chen Quan, I didn’t say that you were a spy. You know that I’m a very suspicious person, so I’ll pay close attention to everyone!”

What he meant was that he was not suspecting Chen Quan at all. He was just trying to find out who the mole was.

Cui Huai paused for a moment and continued, “I believe you’re loyal to me. Dao Wen, this traitor, really deserves to be cut into pieces!” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Mr. Chen smiled coldly.

Cui Huai was so capable. He made the dead sound alive, and he would not let anyone find anything on him.

Mr. Chen could not be bothered to pursue the matter of the mole. He felt that Cui Huai would have more tricks up his sleeve in the future. There was still time.

“How do you want to deal with Dao Wen?” Mr. Chen looked at Cui Huai, the meaning in his eyes obvious. He was forcing Cui Huai to deal with Dao Wen.

This time, Cui Huai really believed that Dao Wen was a traitor. He had never expected Dao Wen to be trapped by a honey trap. No wonder Gu Zhou could escape.

Previously, someone had said that the person who had saved Gu Zhou looked like Chang Feng from behind.

Thinking about it carefully, Chang Feng and Dao Wen looked very similar from behind. Perhaps that person was Dao Wen.

Cui Huai clenched his fists tightly and said coldly, “Those who betray me will only die. Capture Dao Wen and kill him!”

Mr. Chen said nothing.

Cui Huai frowned and said sadly, “However, he’s with Gu Zhou now. It’ll be a little difficult to kill him.”

Cui Huai looked up at Chen Quan and asked, “Then what do you think we should do? It’s impossible for us to go to Gu Zhou’s place to snatch him back now.”

Mr. Chen looked out of the window. It was dark outside, but there was light in the room. It was as if anyone who walked out would be swallowed by darkness.

“Not necessarily,” Mr. Chen said slowly, lowering his gaze.

Cui Huai looked at Mr. Chen in surprise and asked in confusion, “What do you mean by that?”

“Dao Wen betrayed us for a woman. That woman asked him to die. If he was a romantic, he would definitely die willingly.” At this point, Mr. Chen paused and looked up at Cui Huai. “Mr. Cui, Dao Wen is by your side and keeps hinting to you that I’m a traitor. This means that he wants me to die. He definitely won’t stop until he achieves his goal!”

When Cui Huai heard Mr. Chen say the word “hint”, his lips curved up slightly, but it quickly disappeared. He said solemnly, “That’s right. He was the one who kept hinting at me.”

Since Dao Wen was a traitor, it was not a bad choice to let him take the blame.

“I think he might risk his life to rush over.” At this point, Mr. Chen sighed slightly. “Then, he’ll frame me for being a spy!”

“Are you really not a spy?” Cui Huai looked at Chen Quan sharply, wanting to see his truth in his eyes.

The atmosphere in the living room instantly turned serious.

Chen Quan looked at Cui Huai very calmly and said calmly, “Doesn’t Mr. Cui know if I’m with him or not?”

Without waiting for Cui Huai to speak, Mr. Chen said very seriously, “I’ve been by your side for ten years. You gave me everything I have!”

When Cui Huai heard Chen Quan’s words, he had a bright smile on his face. He laughed and said, “Yes, yes, yes. You’re right. We’ve been friends for so many years. I’m unwilling to doubt you, but I admire how calm you are in everything. In that case, let’s wait and see if Dao Wen will return!”

Mr. Chen took out another cigarette and smoked it. He heaved a sigh of relief. It seemed that Chen Quan would not suspect him for the time being.

Time passed bit by bit. About an hour later, Dao Wen returned!

When his subordinates came in and announced that he was back, a trace of surprise flashed in Cui Huai’s eyes.

He didn’t expect Chen Quan to be right.

To be honest, he had admired Chen Quan in the past. Chen Quan did things perfectly and never let anyone find any loopholes.

No matter what, Chen Quan always looked calm. He liked people who were calm in the face of danger.

However, Chen Quan was really too outstanding. Even those people had taken a liking to him.

Some positions could only be taken by one person.

Just as those people were about to let Chen Quan take over, Chen Quan made a mistake. When Chen Quan chased after Gu Zhou, he always let him go.

The higher-ups did not promote Chen Quan for the time being.

Cui Huai initially wanted to find fault with Chen Quan. Later on, he realized that Chen Quan might be related to Gu Zhou. How could he let Chen Quan off?

However, he did not expect the mole to be Dao Wen.
