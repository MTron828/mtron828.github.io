1310 Traitor

Qiao Nian’s pistol had run out of bullets. In order to complete this scene, she ran after them and said loudly, “Chang Feng and Ba Song, as long as you admit that Cui Huai instructed you to kill Gu Zhou, we won’t pursue the fact that you tried to kill him tonight.”

At this moment, Cui Huai’s men also arrived. When Ba Song saw them, he heaved a sigh of relief. He looked at Chang Feng beside him with red-rimmed eyes and said in a low voice, “Brother Feng, hold on a little longer. As long as we get back to the car, we’ll bandage you up.”

Chang Feng nodded weakly. Seeing that Ba Song was about to cry, he said, “I’m fine.”

When the mercenary Cui Huai had sent saw Ba Song and Chang Feng, he immediately got someone to help support Chang Feng. Puzzled, he asked, “Didn’t you arrange everything well? Why are you still injured?”

“I’m so angry. I’ve really misjudged him.” When Ba Song heard Cui Huai’s words, his expression instantly darkened. He clenched his fists tightly, and the veins on the back of his hands bulged ferociously as he smashed into the wall at the side. The wall instantly cracked, and his eyes were filled with hatred. He yearned to tear Dao Wen into pieces. “Dao Wen is a traitor. He’s gotten together with Qiao Nian, who’s beside Gu Zhou. He already told Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian about tonight’s operation. We’ve been tricked. Brother Feng was injured in order to save me!”

Sha He looked at Qiao Nian, who had chased after him but then hid back. His expression darkened as he said, “Dao Wen betrayed us for a woman?”

“Yes, Gu Zhou’s men have long arranged it. They’re just waiting to catch a turtle in a jar!” As Ba Song helped Chang Feng out, he said to looked at Qiao Nian, who had chased after , “Qiao Nian, that little b*tch, still hasn’t given up. She chased after us and shot at us. Fortunately, we left quickly and weren’t hit!”

Sha He had wanted to kill Qiao Nian, but when he thought about how Gu Zhou and the others had long been prepared, he had no choice but to retreat with Ba Song and Chang Feng.

Sha He let Ba Song and Chang Feng leave first. He disguised himself as a doctor and pretended to pass by Gu Zhou’s ward casually. He saw Qiao Nian gently taking off the mask on Dao Wen’s face.

Sha He left quickly with a dark expression. He caught up to Ba Song and Chang Feng again and gritted his teeth. “Dao Wen, that scum, actually betrayed us. So many of our lives were almost sacrificed for Dao Wen to please that little b*tch!”

The few of them were walking forward when they saw another wave of people. That wave of people was Chen Qing’s men. Chen Qing had long instructed them not to chase after them and let them leave alive.

In Gu Zhou’s ward.

From his earpiece, Chen Qing learned that his men had already encountered Sha He and the others. Only then did he walk up to Gu Zhou and say in a low voice, “Second Young Master, they’ve already arrived at the first floor.”

“Okay,” Gu Zhou replied and glanced at the door of the ward.

Chen Qing walked to the door of the ward and closed it.

Gu Zhou looked up at Qiao Nian and said calmly, “Those people have all left. You can remove the needles now.”

Qiao Nian nodded and took out a silver needle. Right now, Dao Wen could only speak and not move.

Dao Wen still wanted to hit Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian and complete the mission with his life, but he couldn’t move. A gun was aimed at his left temple.

Dao Wen was so angry that he was panting heavily. He said angrily, “Why… why did you frame me? Are you acting on purpose? Who are you acting for?”

“What are you talking about? Why don’t I understand?” Qiao Nian blinked in confusion and called out with a smile, “Brother, aren’t you happy that we saved you?”

Dao Wen looked at Qiao Nian’s bright smile. He was so angry that he wanted to punch Qiao Nian in the face, but he couldn’t move at all.

In his anger, Dao Wen’s face turned red. He gritted his teeth, his gaze lingering on Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou’s faces. “It’s Ba Song?” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Dao Wen thought of Ba Song, who had shot him just now. He had never expected Ba Song to shoot him. The two of them had been with Old Master Cui for a long time!

That wasn’t right.

Dao Wen’s eyes gradually calmed down. He had known Ba Song for more than ten years. Ba Song had a one-track mind. He could not think so much.

In the past, when Ba Song lied, he would blush for a long time!

Dao Wen recalled the text from Old Master Cui and gasped. Could it be Chang Feng?

Dao Wen lowered his gaze slightly and inadvertently saw the pocket watch hanging around his neck.

A pocket watch!

Dao Wen felt a chill run down his spine. Chang Feng had given him this pocket watch in the past.
