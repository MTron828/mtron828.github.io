Chapter 680: Washing the Toilet

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Do you think she’ll find someone with STDs?” Gu Zhou felt that there must be something wrong with Chen Qing’s brain.

At this moment, Chen Qing was trembling. He hurriedly said, “There’s also a 23-year-old person called Gu Chuan. He’s a student at the music academy and is being kept by a 50-year-old woman!”

Gu Zhou’s frown deepened. His Adam’s apple bobbed under the moonlight, and his eyes looked even deeper. “Scrub the toilet bowl for a month!”

With that, Gu Zhou hung up.

Who exactly was the Gu Chuan Qiao Nian was calling?

What exactly was she thinking?

These questions lingered in Gu Zhou’s mind, and his frown deepened.

At this moment, Qiao Nian had already arrived at the second floor. She walked to the door of Gu Qi’s room and carefully pushed it open.

There was a dim yellow night light in the room, and the gentle light fell on Gu Qi’s small face.

Qiao Nian walked over quietly. She bent down and covered Gu Qi with the blanket.

Her gaze fell on Gu Qi’s face again. Seeing the corners of Gu Qi’s lips curl up slightly in his sleep, she couldn’t help but laugh. His dream must have been a beautiful dream.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips and silently said, “Goodnight.” Then, she walked out.

When Qiao Nian passed by Gu Zhou’s room, she saw that the lights were still dim. A trace of confusion flashed in her eyes. Could it be that Gu Zhou hadn’t come up yet?

What was he doing down there?

Qiao Nian walked towards her room. She turned on the lights and closed the door, walking to the window.

She was about to draw the curtains, take a shower, and sleep when her gaze inadvertently fell on the garden pavilion.

The lights in the garden pavilion were still on.

Gu Zhou sat alone in the pavilion. He looked into the distance expressionlessly, his phone resting on the stone table.

A trace of confusion flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes. Why was Gu Zhou sitting in the pavilion in a daze?

She took out her phone and called Gu Zhou.

As soon as the call went through, Gu Zhou picked up instantly.

“Gu Zhou, why are you sitting alone in the pavilion? Why aren’t you coming up?”

“Nian Nian, why have you forgotten my name again?”

Zhou Zhou’s aggrieved voice came from the phone. His voice was as hoarse as usual, but there was a hint of childishness.

When Qiao Nian heard his voice, she was stunned!

What was going on?

Why had Zhou Zhou run out again?

When they first returned, nothing special happened.

Perhaps it was because he hadn’t heard Qiao Nian’s voice, but Zhou Zhou seemed to be like an abandoned child. He said aggrievedly, “Nian Nian, have you fallen for someone else and don’t like Zhou Zhou anymore?”

Qiao Nian felt as if she had been struck by lightning.

It had not been easy for her.

It was already very troublesome to take care of just one Gu Zhou. Moreover, Gu Zhou had two personalities in his body.

Although she didn’t know why Zhou Zhou had run out, she could only comfort him immediately.

“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, Zhou Zhou. I accidentally called the wrong name just now!”

“Alright, I’ll forgive you!” His voice was a little arrogant and gentle, making one’s heart soften.

Every time Qiao Nian met Zhou Zhou, she would speak to him gently, afraid that she would scare him.

“Zhou Zhou, it’s getting late. Why don’t you go upstairs and rest?”

“Zhou Zhou misses you!”

His voice was soft, very similar to Gu Qi’s tone, but his voice was even deeper and hoarser.

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned.

Could it be that every time Zhou Zhou appeared, it was also because of her?

Qiao Nian smiled and said, “It’s getting late. You should rest early!”

“Zhou Zhou wants a hug from Nian Nian!”

Qiao Nian felt that there was something strange about Zhou Zhou’s overlapping words.

“Nian Nian, Zhou Zhou wants a hug now. Nian Nian, can you come down?”

Qiao Nian was in a mess. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

It was also because he hadn’t heard Qiao Nian’s response that he said carefully, “Why don’t Nian Nian hold Zhou Zhou’s hand?”

His voice sounded so humble, as if he was pleading with her.

Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat.
