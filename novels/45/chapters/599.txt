There was also her third brother. When she was in MY, Third Brother was her bodyguard, and he was the most handsome bodyguard present. Not only that, Third Brother’s style of doing things was very similar to hers. Back then, she felt that the two of them complemented each other very well.

Qiao Nian and Lu Zhu were talking when her phone rang in less than ten minutes.

She took out her phone and saw that it was Su Sheng calling.

“Miss Su.”

“Miss Qiao, I’m already downstairs.” Su Sheng’s gentle voice came through the phone.

Qiao Nian’s eyes instantly filled with stars. She said, “Alright, I’ll go down now.”

“Alright.”

After the call, Qiao Nian stood up. Seeing that Lu Zhu was about to get up as well, she hurriedly said, “Brother, don’t move. I’ll go myself. You should hurry home and recuperate!”

“Sugar …”

“Brother, I’m also very worried about your health. I hope you can recover soon.” Qiao Nian interrupted Lu Zhu, a bright smile appearing in her eyes.

When Lu Zhu heard Qiao Nian’s words, he thought for a moment and said, “Alright!”

“Brother, when you recover, I’ll treat you to a meal.” When Qiao Nian heard Lu Zhu agree, she took her bag and walked out.

Lu Zhu sat on the sofa and looked at Qiao Nian’s back from afar. His lips curved up slightly, his eyes filled with a smile. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Sugar.

His Sugar was still alive.

He could still hear Sugar’s words of concern.

It felt so good.

As Lu Zhu thought about this, Lu Nian and Lu Rao’s faces flashed in his mind. He really wanted to be with Sugar for a while longer.

At this moment, his phone rang again. Lu Zhu took out his phone and looked at the caller ID. A trace of confusion flashed in his eyes.

Strange, why was Lu Nian calling?

With this thought in mind, Lu Zhu picked up the call and placed the phone to his ear. He asked casually, “What’s wrong?”

“Brother, I’ve already arrived at Yongan Building. Do you want to go downstairs yourself, or should I pick you up?”

Lu Zhu frowned when he heard Lu Nian’s strong voice. When he left, Lu Nian was practicing the violin in the piano room. Why was he here?

“Aren’t you busy?” Lu Zhu stood up from the sofa and walked out.

“I didn’t want to come either, but when Grandma found out that you had run out on your own, she was very angry. She said that she wanted to bring you back to the family for punishment!” Lu Nian sounded helpless as he spoke.

A trace of surprise flashed in Lu Zhu’s eyes. He initially wanted to spend time with Sugar. Now that Lu Nian was here, he would definitely see Sugar.

Sigh.

His sister was not his to own.

At the thought of this, Lu Zhu couldn’t help but sigh. “Wait for me in the hall.”

If he deliberately let Lu Nian and Sugar meet the wrong way this time, Lu Nian would definitely cause trouble when he found out the truth.

He had tried his best. If he didn’t see her, then he would leave it to fate. This wasn’t something he could decide.

At this moment, in the Gu family villa.

Gu Zhou sat down beside Gu Qi. His phoenix-like eyes narrowed slightly as he looked at Gu Qi expressionlessly.

It was strange. Gu Qi was so young. In theory, shouldn’t he do whatever he said?

Now, Gu Qi was still sitting on the chair and looking out. He looked as if he had turned into a rock.

Even if he played cartoons for him, he wouldn’t watch them.

Gu Zhou took out his phone and sent Qiao Nian a message.

“When are you coming back? Gu Qi misses you.”

In the elevator of the Yongan Building.

When Qiao Nian saw the text message, she hurriedly read it. When she opened it, a trace of anxiety flashed in her eyes.

Gu Qi would definitely not have said that he missed her as he was autistic. Gu Zhou could not take care of her anymore, so he sent her a message.

“I’ll be back soon. Take good care of him!” After Qiao Nian sent the message, she glanced at the time. Gu Qi was still sick. He should rest more.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian looked up at the numbers on the elevator display.

The elevator number changed to “1”.

“Ding dong.”

The elevator doors opened.

Qiao Nian lowered her head and put her phone into her bag, then quickly walked out.

At this moment, Lu Nian walked in and saw an anxious Qiao Nian walking out.
