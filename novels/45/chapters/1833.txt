Halfway through the meal, Lu You began to talk to Gu Zhou. “What did you find in Europe this time?”

Hearing Lu You’s words, everyone at the table fell silent. After all, they were all very curious about what had happened in Europe. They were also curious about who was dealing with the Lu family behind their backs.

Lu You had asked Gu Zhou directly because he wanted to see Gu Zhou’s way of looking at the world. He also wanted to know Gu Zhou’s character, which was more conducive to his understanding of him.

Although his eldest daughter, Sugar, was already married to Gu Zhou, he still wanted to test his son-in-law more. He couldn’t let Sugar suffer in love.

When Gu Zhou heard Lu You’s words, he placed the chicken soup dumpling he had picked up previously on the plate in front of Qiao Nian. Only then did he put down his chopsticks and slowly look up at Lu You.

His eyes were as cold and silent as ever, giving off the feeling that he could only be looked at from afar.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

However, when Gu Zhou smiled politely at Lu You, the sense of alienation faded a lot, giving off a gentle feeling.

He briefly explained what had happened in Europe. However, due to the special identities of the President and the Seventh Princess, Lina, some things were just summarized in a sentence. He briefly stated the facts and did not say much about the European royal family. In the end, he praised the President for being broad-minded and bold, and even said that Nian’er was smart.

Everyone in the Lu family listened very seriously.

At this moment, Lu Zhu asked curiously, “You just said that the First Madam and the Seventh Princess of Europe will come to An City in a few days.”

“Yes.” Gu Zhou looked at Lu Zhu with a much gentler gaze. He and Lu Zhu had been good friends for many years, so he was relaxed when speaking to him.

Su Yan sat at the side, frowning slightly. Her eyes were a little more serious. “Are they coming to An City because of you?”

Su Yan felt that this matter was a little strange. Although her daughter and son-in-law had a good relationship with the European President, how could the First Madam and Princess of a country casually go to other countries? Wasn’t the European President worried about the safety of his wife and daughter at all?

There should be something else going on.

Instinctively, she held Qiao Nian’s hand, looking like she wanted to say something but hesitated.

Just now, Gu Zhou had made it very clear that she was very close to the Seventh Princess of the European Union, Lina. However, if something happened between the First Madam of the European Union and the Seventh Princess in An City, wouldn’t the relationship between the two sides become hostile?

Su Yan subconsciously wanted to protect Qiao Nian. She felt that the First Madam and the Seventh Princess of Europe shouldn’t come to An City.

“Sugar, their identities are a little too special. Let’s not…” Before Su Yan could finish speaking, she saw Qiao Nian handing her a phone.

Su Yan looked at Qiao Nian in surprise. Her gaze fell on the phone screen. When she saw the photo of a young and beautiful girl on the screen, she was slightly stunned.

“Mom, this is the Seventh Princess,” Qiao Nian introduced with a smile.

Su Yan looked at Lina’s photo carefully. The more she looked at it, the more she felt that the young lady in the photo looked familiar, but she was certain that she had never seen this young lady before.

Su Yan recalled carefully, her frown deepening. She said in a low voice, “I think

I’ve seen the Seventh Princess before, but that’s not right either. I’ve seen the

European President. He’s a traditional European man.”

“The First Madam is from An City to begin with, ” Qiao Nian reminded him with a smile.

From An City?

Su Yan looked up at Qiao Nian and subconsciously asked, “What’s the First Madam’s name?”

“Her surname is Shen,” Qiao Nian said with a smile.

Su Yan’s eyes lit up. She asked in disbelief, “Could she be Shen Mei?”

“Yes, the First Madam is Professor Shen An’s daughter, Shen Mei. Lina is Professor Shen An’s granddaughter.”

Everyone was stunned.

Auntie Cao, who was about to scoop the soup, almost broke the bowl when she heard this. She finally calmed down and stood there in fear.

How was that possible?

Hadn’t Shen Mei died long ago?

Qiao Nian had been secretly paying attention to Auntie Cao. Seeing that she didn’t look well, she seemed to understand what was going on.

From the corner of his eye, Gu Zhou glanced at Auntie Cao, his eyes turbulent..
