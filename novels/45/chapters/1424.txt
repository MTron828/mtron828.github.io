1425 Rescue

Qiao Nian sensed the displeasure on Gu Zhou’s face. She had also noticed that the Seventh Princess had been stealing glances at Gu Zhou. However, the Seventh Princess was the daughter of the European President. It probably wasn’t good for Gu Zhou to reject her so bluntly.

Their trip to Europe this time might require the President’s help in some places. However, they had offended the Seventh Princess. If their relationship soured, it would not be convenient for them to do anything in Europe.

Her people had just found out that the kidnapping more than twenty years ago might be related to the president of Europe.

Qiao Nian narrowed her beautiful fox-like eyes. The person in front of her was the daughter of the European President. Perhaps she could take this opportunity to get to know him.

With this thought in mind, a gentle smile appeared on Qiao Nian’s face. She said, “Hello, Seventh Princess. I want to know more about interesting places in Europe. I can ask you about them!”

Gu Ting glanced at Qiao Nian, then left his seat. He pulled a chair over and invited Lina to take a seat. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Lina naturally sat down beside Gu Ting. Qiao Nian happened to be sitting directly opposite her. She looked at Qiao Nian gratefully. She was very thankful for Qiao Nian’s help just now.

Lina had already investigated Gu Zhou before she came. Gu Zhou was the Second Young Master of the Gu family and the only heir of the Gu family now. She had heard that he had been ill since he was young, but from Gu Zhou’s expression, she couldn’t tell that he was sick at all.

Perhaps Gu Zhou was just deliberately revealing to the outside world that he was ill to make the women who pursued him retreat.

She had also heard that Gu Zhou had once been engaged to the eldest daughter of the Lu family, Lu Nian. However, the eldest daughter of the Lu family had long passed away.

However, she was very curious why the girl in front of her had appeared hand in hand with Gu Zhou at the airport.

Could it be that there had been some changes to the Gu Corporation? Did Gu Zhou get someone to create some gossip to attract the attention of the public?

Lina’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. The girl in the photo was already very good-looking, but when she really saw Qiao Nian, all her attention was on her charming fox-like eyes.

This girl was really too beautiful. This was the first time Lina had lost her confidence.

What was the relationship between this beautiful girl and Gu Zhou?

Lina was even more straightforward. She had a gentle and considerate smile on her face as she looked at Gu Ting beside her and asked, “Mr. Gu, may I ask who this lady is…”

Gu Ting’s gaze landed on Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian’s faces. He knew that the two of them had secretly married previously. He didn’t know if he should announce their relationship at this time. He hesitated.

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on Lina’s face. Lina’s nervousness rose to her throat, and even her breathing became lighter.

This man was really too handsome, especially when he was looking at her. Lina felt so happy that she was about to suffocate.

Gu Zhou’s thin lips parted slightly as he said, “Seventh Princess, this is my wife, Qiao Nian.”

Lina looked at Gu Zhou stiffly, as if a basin of cold water had been poured over her head.

Oh my god, what had she just been doing?

She had actually seduced this man in front of Qiao Nian. This was really inappropriate.

Qiao Nian could see the embarrassment on Lina’s face. She suddenly felt that Lina didn’t look like an arrogant and despotic young lady. Instead, she looked like an obedient girl.

Before Lina came, she should have investigated Gu Zhou. She and Gu Zhou were secretly married, so it was only natural that Lina didn’t find out.

It was better to repent.

Smiling, Qiao Nian poured a glass of red wine and dripped it in front of Lina. Smiling, she asked, “I heard that Bear Mountain Falls is very beautiful. I wonder if the Seventh Princess has been there?”

Lina was slightly stunned. She didn’t expect Mrs. Gu to help her out. She had just been coveting her husband.

However, Mrs. Gu still helped her magnanimously. Lina immediately had a good impression of Madam Gu.

One had to know that if anyone had improper thoughts about her husband, she would never let that person have an easy time.

Lina smiled and looked at Qiao Nian gently. “The waterfall at Bear Mountain is indeed spectacular. When the sun shines on the waterfall during the day, the scenery will be even more beautiful.”
