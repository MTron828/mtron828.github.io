Chapter 200: Expert Hacker?

At this moment, the door opened and Gu Zhou walked in. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Qiao Nian looked up and saw Gu Zhou walking in, his clothes casual. He was holding a folder.

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on the blessing bag in Qiao Nian’s hand. His dark eyes lit up a little, but the light quickly disappeared.

Was she making this blessing bag for him?

Qiao Nian didn’t notice Gu Zhou’s gaze. All her attention was on the folder in Gu Zhou’s hand. Puzzled, she asked, “Mr. Gu, what can I do for you?”

As she spoke, Qiao Nian put the blessing bag aside and stood up.

Gu Zhou walked up to Qiao Nian and handed her the folder. He said softly, “This is for you.”

A trace of confusion flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes. She took the folder and opened it. When she saw the document inside, she gasped.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou with sparkling eyes, smiling. “This is an acceptance letter from An City’s Academy of Music!”

Qiao Nian’s joy seemed to infect Gu Zhou as well. He nodded slightly, giving a faint murmur of assent.

When Qiao Nian smiled, her beautiful fox-like eyes curved into crescents, making her look incredibly charming. In that instant, she had practically forgotten all the unhappy things that had taken place today. Her red lips curved up. “You’re so efficient!”

The corner of Gu Zhou’s mouth curved up imperceptibly. After a beat, he calmed himself down and said, “I’ve already done the necessary introductions. You don’t have to go to class on time every day. As long as you pass the exams, you can get your diploma.”

Qiao Nian’s slender hand gently caressed the acceptance letter from the music academy. She couldn’t help but smile as she nodded. “Okay.”

Gu Zhou sat down easily on the sofa, waiting for Qiao Nian’s excitement to subside. Seeing that she had sat down as well, he took out the piece of paper on which he had copied out the code. He handed it to Qiao Nian, his eyes fixed on her.

Qiao Nian took it from Gu Zhou. The relaxed and happy expression on her face gradually dissipated. She looked at Gu Zhou in surprise. “How… how did you get this?”

Gu Zhou said honestly, “I saw it when you were typing it in the car.”

A trace of surprise flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes. This code was very complicated. Generally speaking, an intelligent person would have to repeat it to themselves more than ten times before they could memorize it.

However, Gu Zhou had only taken a glance, but actually managed to memorize every symbol of the code.

Did he have an eidetic memory?

Seeing Qiao Nian lower her head in silence, Gu Zhou didn’t know what she was thinking. His eyes narrowed slightly as he said, “You’re a hacker!”

Gu Zhou’s words were filled with certainty.

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she looked up at him, her gaze calm.

Previously, she had discovered that Gu Zhou had spent money to investigate her. Later on, she had gotten someone to feed Gu Zhou some information, and had accepted all of Gu Zhou’s money herself.

Did Gu Zhou realize that she had taken his money against her conscience?

Qiao Nian refused to admit it until the last moment. Her lips curved up slightly as she said with a smile, “I’ve only learned a little coding. For example, hacking computers, stealing documents, and cutting off other people’s communication signals. When I learned this in the past, it was to find out more about the shares Grandma left me.”

“Is that so?” Gu Zhou said coldly.

“Okay.” Qiao Nian nodded. Her heart was beating extremely fast, but she didn’t show it on her face. She sensed that Gu Zhou didn’t have any evidence. If he had, he would have found out about her long ago.

Moreover, only Old A knew about her situation. Old A would definitely not tell anyone about her.

However, Qiao Nian still felt a little uneasy.

Gu Zhou asked curiously, “Then do you know Mr. K?”

“I’ve heard of her.” When Qiao Nian said this, her eyes were filled with admiration. She continued, “She’s one of the greatest hackers in the hacker world. All hackers admire her. I want to learn hacking from her, too, but no one has ever seen her. She hides herself too well.”
