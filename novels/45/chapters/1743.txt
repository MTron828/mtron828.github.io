Chapter 1744 - 1744 Conspiracy

The president had been in Europe for so many years. He had been taught since he was young on how to govern a country, so he did not trust anyone.

He looked up at Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian warily.

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian were foreigners. Would they really help him?

What made the president hesitate was that Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian actually knew so much that he didn’t know.

Could he really work with them?

He had heard a saying from Country Z in the past that the mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind.

He didn’t know if Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian were good or bad. Would they take the opportunity to take over Europe?

Qiao Nian noticed the change in the President’s gaze. She narrowed her eyes slightly, her expression bright. Then, she looked at Gu Zhou.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Gu Zhou looked into the president’s eyes. Previously, for the sake of the Gu family, he had not trusted outsiders, so he could understand the president’s concerns.

Gu Zhou said sincerely, “President, Nian Nian and I came to Europe because we wanted to investigate the kidnapping twenty-one years ago. We didn’t want to interfere in the conflict in your country, but Mark had harmed the Gu and Lu families. We had no choice but to interfere.”

As Lina listened to Gu Zhou’s words, her gaze fell on the wound where Via had applied medicine for her. She interrupted, “Father, whether Mr. Gu and Nian Nian are around or not, our battle with Mark will begin. In other words, we aren’t fighting with Mark because they’re here. We’ve always been at odds with Mark.”

The European royal family knew about Mark and her father. It was just that everyone was pretending not to know and was unwilling to make things clear.

For so many years, her father had basically been controlled by Mark. Her father could only control a small portion of power.

If her father wanted to be the president of Europe, he had to resist Mark with all his might.

If Mark wanted to be the president of Europe, he had to ruin her father’s reputation or kill him.

The person in charge of Europe was either his father or Mark.

There was no need for anyone to instigate this matter.

When the president heard Lina’s words, a trace of surprise flashed in his eyes. He turned to look at Lina.

Back then, Lina had already surprised him by taking the initiative to marry Wright. At that time, his daughter was like a knife and she had taken the initiative to stab Mark’s chest.

He was the owner of the knife. He had stabbed Mark and benefited from harming him.

Lina had already grown up. She had learned to see the big picture.

The president looked at Lina with a complicated expression. He was glad that Lina had grown up, because she was already very smart.

However, he was also very sad that Lina had grown up. His daughter should live carefreely. She shouldn’t have to live such a hard life.

The president pursed his lips slightly and said, “Lina, actually, I’ve always been unwilling to let you interfere in these things. These things are really too messy. Moreover, if you don’t interfere, you might be fine in the future.”

The president’s words were vague. In fact, he was thinking that even if he failed and Lina didn’t know anything, Mark probably wouldn’t even bother with Lina. Then Lina could still live well as an ordinary person.

Lina met the president’s pained gaze and smiled. She held the president’s hand with her uninjured hand and said softly, “Father, even if I don’t get involved, do you think Mark will let me off? When that happens, they’ll have the final say in everything.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “Father, if you’re no longer around, I might suffer even more than last night.”

The President looked at Lina in front of him, his eyes gradually becoming firm. He looked at Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian gently and said, “What do you plan to do next?”

When Qiao Nian heard the president’s words, she knew that he believed them. With a happy smile on her face, she said, “There are two very important things in Mark’s basement.”
