936 Destroy Qiao Nian?

Ever since Su Xue’s divorce, she had wanted to remarry, but Qiao Shan’s attitude towards her had always been lukewarm.

She had thought that her relationship with Qiao Shan might take a year or two to ease, but she did not expect the opportunity to come.

Qiao Xin was their child. Of course she cared about her own child. From what Qiao Shan said, she would never let the other party off. Hence, she went along with Qiao Shan’s words. “Qiao Xin is my precious daughter and my life. I will definitely make that person pay the price!”

When Qiao Shan heard Su Xue’s words, his hatred for her lessened.

Although Su Xue had done something ridiculous, she was still the mother of his two children. In the past, she had treated him and the two children well with all her heart.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Shan looked up at Su Xue.

Su Xue looked much thinner and haggard than before.

Could it be that Su Xue had really repented?

Qiao Shan retracted his gaze. As long as his daughter was safe this time, he would let Su Xue come back to him. After all, Qiao Xin kept asking for her mother.

As for the past, forget it. He wouldn’t make a fuss about it.

As a parent, he should think for his child. It was not a big deal for him to suffer a little.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Shan said in a low voice, “Xin Xin will definitely be fine. Her leg is injured, so it might not be convenient for her to recuperate in the future. Move over and take care of her later!”

Su Xue’s eyes widened involuntarily. She looked at Qiao Shan in disbelief, her eyes filled with gratitude. Her voice choked as she said, “Brother Shan, thank you. Thank you for being willing to let me take care of Xin Xin!”

Qiao Shan looked into Su Xue’s teary eyes and turned to the side. Although he had asked Su Xue to take care of Qiao Xin, this didn’t mean that he really didn’t care about what Su Xue had done in the past.

Qiao Yu remained silent. He lowered his gaze to look at the black screen of his phone, but his thoughts drifted away.

Suddenly, his phone screen lit up.

Qiao Yu gradually came back to his senses. He turned on his phone and saw a text.

“Before Miss went to the Red Hotel tonight, she had already agreed with He Cheng to find a few men to ruin Qiao Nian. However, Qiao Nian was saved by someone else. I wonder if Miss’s injury this time has anything to do with this?”

Qiao Yu looked at the contents of the phone and his pupils dilated.

He wasn’t a three or four-year-old child. Of course he understood what it meant to ruin Qiao Nian. His hand, which was holding the phone, trembled uncontrollably.

How could Qiao Xin do this?

Qiao Yu didn’t dare to imagine if Qiao Nian would go crazy if she was ruined again. He had just called Qiao Nian to question her.

At this moment, the door of the emergency operating theater opened.

Qiao Yu put away his phone and looked at the doctor who had walked out with a pale face. He stood rooted to the ground.

Qiao Shan and Su Xue quickly walked up to the doctor, looking anxious.

“Doctor, how’s my daughter now? Is she safe and sound?” Qiao Shan asked anxiously.

Exhausted, the attending doctor took off the mask on his face and gave a relieved smile. “The surgery was very successful. We’ve already removed the bullet from Miss Qiao’s thigh. She just lost too much blood. Her life isn’t in danger.”

Only then did Qiao Shan heave a sigh of relief. As long as Qiao Xin was fine.

Su Xue seemed to have thought of something and asked worriedly, “Then did she hurt her bones? Will she be able to walk normally in the future?”

Su Xue’s question made Qiao Shan’s heart skip a beat. He looked at the attending doctor nervously.

The attending doctor smiled and said, “Don’t worry, Miss Qiao is lucky. The bullet didn’t hit her bones or her meridians. As long as she recuperates well, she can walk normally in the future.”

When Su Xue heard the attending doctor’s words, she heaved a long sigh of relief. A relieved smile appeared on her face. “That’s good. It’s good that you can walk normally in the future. Doctor, thank you.”

Qiao Shan heaved a sigh of relief. Fortunately, his daughter was fine. If something had happened to her, he wouldn’t know what to do!

“Miss Qiao was injected with anesthesia during the surgery. After the anesthesia wears off, she might feel a lot of pain. When the time comes, you don’t have to worry too much. This is normal. She should eat some light food these days. Don’t let her get out of bed and walk around. She has to recuperate well!” the doctor instructed seriously.
