Chapter 403: What was going on?

“I’m going overseas now. I’ll look for you when I return, okay?” Qiao Nian explained gently.

“Okay!” Gu Qi replied in a clear voice.

Qiao Nian was about to board the plane, so she turned off her phone.

At this moment, there was a stream of people in the distance.

“Oh my god, look! It’s Eldest Young Master Lu!”

“He’s so handsome. I can’t take it anymore. I’m suffocating!”

“I’ll be lucky if I can marry him!”

“That’s strange. Who’s the woman beside him? I’ve never seen her before. Is she his girlfriend?”

“When the two of them stand together, they look like a perfect match!”

… .

When Qiao Nian heard the words “Song Yue”, she turned her head and saw Song Yue’s beautiful face and bright red lips that made her look sparkling. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Song Yue and Lu Zhu walked side by side, but in Qiao Nian’s opinion, they were indeed a match made in heaven.

Just as Qiao Nian was deep in thought, the two people who attracted her attention had already walked up to her.

Lu Zhu stopped in front of Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian raised her eyes slightly. Even though Lu Zhu was looking at her with such indifference, she couldn’t help but have a good impression of him.

Qiao Nian hurriedly threw such thoughts to the back of her mind.

Lu Zhu glanced behind Qiao Nian and frowned slightly. Puzzled, he asked, “Are you alone?”

A faint smile appeared on Qiao Nian’s face. She said jokingly, “There’s you!”

Lu Zhu’s frown deepened, and a hint of displeasure flashed across his eyes. Actually, his impression of Qiao Nian had already changed during his younger brother’s concert. However, this impression had completely disappeared with her joke.

Song Yue had been by Lu Zhu’s side for a long time, so she remembered every expression of his. At this moment, when Lu Zhu frowned, she couldn’t help but frown as well.

Song Yue looked at Qiao Nian in disgust and said, “Miss Qiao, Brother Ah Zhu and I have never thought of bringing you along. Please behave yourself!”

Song Yue had heard of Qiao Nian before. At the time, she had only attended as an investor of a financial company. She felt that Qiao Nian was indeed very talented in planting flowers and plants.

However, what Qiao Nian had just said instantly wiped away her good impression of her.

Could it be that Qiao Nian had heard that she and Lu Zhu were going to MY, so she deliberately wanted to stop them?

Most of the people who went to MY were there to gamble on stones. Did Qiao Nian know how to do it too?

Qiao Nian was an expert at planting flowers and plants, but she was definitely an amateur at stone gambling.

Sigh.

Song Yue didn’t need to think to know that Qiao Nian was the kind of person who wanted to marry into a wealthy family!

She really couldn’t understand how Qiao Yu could have such a brainless sister.

Hearing Song Yue’s words, Qiao Nian’s beautiful fox-like eyes narrowed slightly. She said, “Miss Song, it doesn’t seem like you have the final say in whether I’ll be brought along or not!”

Song Yue raised her chin arrogantly with a look of disdain. “Brother Ah Zhu, it’s impossible…”

Lu Zhu interrupted Song Yue without hesitation, his voice turning cold. “It’s getting late. It’s time to board the plane!”

When Song Yue heard Lu Zhu’s words, she was stunned. Was he talking to her or Qiao Nian?

Just as Song Yue was feeling puzzled, Lu Zhu continued, “Lin Nan, help Miss Qiao get her luggage!”

Song Yue’s body swayed slightly, and she was in a mess.

She clearly felt that Lu Zhu didn’t like Qiao Nian. Why did he have to bring Qiao Nian along?

Song Yue frowned. Lu Zhu was not giving her any face!

Qiao Nian didn’t care what Song Yue thought. She smiled gently and said, “Thank you!”

After saying that, Qiao Nian glanced at Song Yue indifferently, the smugness and contempt in her eyes obvious.

Song Yue pursed her lips tightly. She could feel the warning from Qiao Nian. Qiao Nian seemed to be warning her to speak less in the future.
