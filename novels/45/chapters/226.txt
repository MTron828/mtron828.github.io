Chapter 227: Trouble

Liu Xin, who had delivered the gift, sized Qiao Nian up with an impudent gaze. Her red lips curved up in a faint smile as she said disdainfully, “You played ‘Spring and Snow’ pretty well.”

With that, Liu Xin turned and left, leaving behind the faint fragrance of her hair.

Qiao Nian watched as Liu Xin left. Her beautiful fox-like eyes narrowed slightly. She looked down at the gift on the table. For some reason, she felt that this gift might bring some trouble.

“Nian Nian, quickly open it. We really want to know what Senior Xia gave you.”

Hence, Qiao Nian opened the gift in front of everyone. Inside was an exquisite model of the guqin. It looked expensive.

It did look good.

Xia Xue was too well-informed. It had only been slightly over twenty minutes since she finished playing “Spring and Snow”, but Xia Xue had already gotten someone to send a gift over. If it was any other gift, it would be fine.

However, Xia Xue had sent over a model of the guqin. It was clearly a challenge.

At this moment, a cry of surprise came from the side.

“Sister Ran, is this for real? This is a ticket to Mr. Donghua’s concert. Ah, you’re so lucky!”

At the mention of Donghua, Qiao Nian subconsciously turned her head to look. She saw a fair-skinned young girl surrounded by a group of excited students, clearly in the center of attention. Pride was written all over her face. “You’re making a fuss over nothing. This is just a ticket!”

“Sister Ran, you can’t say that. You’re talking about Donghua! He’s the most mysterious musician in the world. The tickets to his concert are priceless. Why are you still so calm?”

The girl called Sister Ran pursed her lips and said, “My father knows him, so he gave my father a few tickets.”

“Ye Ran, you’ll make people hate you. We’re so envious that we’re about to cry!”

A faint smile appeared on Ye Ran’s face. She enjoyed being the center of attention very much. She said calmly, “It’s just a pity that the concert is taking place in a few days. Otherwise, I can get my father to speak to Mr. Donghua and ask for a few more tickets. Then, we’ll all be able to go together.”

The eyes of the girls around Ye Ran lit up. In their hearts, being able to attend Mr. Donghua’s concert in person would be something worth remembering for the rest of their lives.

“Ye Ran, Sister Ran, can you bring us along when Mr Donghua holds a concert again?”

“That’s right, Sister Ran. You’re the best. Take us with you!”

“Sister Ran, we’re begging you!”

In an elegant motion, Ye Ran placed the tickets into her bag, then raised a hand to casually twirl a lock of hair around her finger. She smiled and said, “Lately, I’ve been especially fond of that new line of Gucci bags. I even thought of buying one!”

One girl reacted faster than the others. She said immediately, “Sister Ran, it’s just a small matter of buying a handbag. We’ll buy one for you!”

Ye Ran smiled at the girl. “Don’t worry, I’ll definitely bring my best friends along next time. After all, good things have to be shared!”

“Sister Ran, you’re the best!”

“Sister Ran, I really love you. Your grades are good, you’re beautiful, and you have a good character.”

More and more people in the class surrounded Ye Ran, all fighting to suck up to her. They really wanted tickets to Mr. Donghua’s concert.

Seeing this, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

When her deskmate, Wang Xuan, heard Qiao Nian’s laugh and saw her disdainful expression, she asked casually, “Don’t you like Mr. Donghua?”

Qiao Nian gave a faint smile and replied casually, “I just think that Mr. Donghua might not need fans like these.”

Wang Xuan gave Qiao Nian a steady look, then smiled. “That’s true.”

At the other side of the room, the students were all gossiping about Mr. Donghua.

“Sister Ran, you must have seen Mr. Donghua before, right? What does he look like?”

“Yes, yes. Sister Ran, how old is Mr. Donghua?” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m
