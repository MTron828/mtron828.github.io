Chapter 237: Do You Still Believe Me?

Wang Xuan didn’t believe at all that Qiao Nian would steal Ye Ran’s tickets. Compared to this, she was more willing to believe that Ye Ran had stuffed the tickets into Qiao Nian’s violin box and framed her on purpose.

Wang Xuan turned to look at Qiao Nian. She saw Qiao Nian standing there calmly, as if everything around her had nothing to do with her. Thinking that Qiao Nian had been distracted, she called out softly, “Nian Nian, speak up. Say that they’re framing you on purpose!”

When Ye Ran heard Wang Xuan’s words, she glared at her and said coldly, “Wang Xuan, shut up. Qiao Nian is a thief. Hurry up and call Professor Zhang over. Get him to chase the thief away!”

Gao Lin quickly nodded and said, “I’ll go now.”

Qiao Nian didn’t even look at Ye Ran. Her gaze fell on Wang Xuan’s face.

She could sense Wang Xuan’s worry for her. From the beginning of the incident until now, Wang Xuan had always been on her side.

Qiao Nian looked into Wang Xuan’s worried eyes and pursed her lips. “Even now, you still believe me?”

Wang Xuan had never expected Qiao Nian to speak in this manner. Helplessness flashed across her face as she said, “It’s my intuition. I believe you’re not such a person. Hurry up and explain to everyone!”

When Qiao Nian heard Wang Xuan’s words, her red lips curved up slightly. When she smiled, the sunlight around her seemed to lose its color. “But this has nothing to do with you. You don’t have to risk your future just because of me!”

Wang Xuan had just been charmed by Qiao Nian’s smile, but she quickly came back to her senses and frowned in disapproval. “Nian Nian, what are you saying? What do you mean by risking my future? Moreover, Ye Ran can’t be the only one who has the final say in this matter because things haven’t been cleared up yet. If you really stole something from someone else, then I can only blame myself for being blind!”

The smile on Qiao Nian’s face grew even brighter. A small and obedient girl like Wang Xuan was actually a straightforward person. From now on, Wang Xuan would be her good friend!

Qiao Nian’s gaze moved from Wang Xuan’s side profile to Ye Ran’s face. She said, “This ticket is indeed mine!”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Ye Ran couldn’t stop smiling. Her eyes were filled with ridicule. “How can a country bumpkin like you get a ticket to Mr. Dong Hua’s concert? Do you think this ticket is so easy to get? You might not even be able to get one in your next life!”

Ye Ran knew that Qiao Nian might not understand her words. She said proudly, “Mr. Donghua’s tickets are never sold to outsiders. He only gives them to respected musicians in the music industry. From whom did you get this ticket?”

“I don’t think there’s a musician in An City with the surname Qiao!” Ye Ran raised her eyebrows slightly and looked at Qiao Nian provocatively. “Qiao Nian, stop using sophistry. Your behavior will only make me hate you even more. Forget it, on account that we were classmates, if you compensate me with the violin as compensation for my mental trauma, I’ll forgive you for your shameless theft. I won’t call the police anymore, and I’ll let you continue to stay in the academy. How about that?”

Qiao Nian’s patience had run out.

She took a step forward and snatched the tickets back from Ye Ran. Without hesitation, she slapped Ye Ran.

“Ah!” Ye Ran cried out in fear.

Everyone was shocked by Qiao Nian’s actions.

Ye Ran covered her face in disbelief. Her face was burning with pain, and her ears were buzzing. Many stars seemed to flash before her eyes, and she could not react for a long time. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“How… how dare you hit me!” Ye Ran glared at Qiao Nian viciously.

Qiao Nian put the violin back into the case, then looked at Ye Ran slowly. “I gave you a chance a long time ago. You didn’t want it.”

A clear slap mark appeared on Ye Ran’s face. She glared at Qiao Nian with hatred written all over her face. If looks could kill, Qiao Nian would have died a long time ago.
