Qiao Nian could understand Song Yu’s thoughts. As long as Song Yu had no other intentions, she was willing to get along peacefully with her.

Moreover, the fake good Song Yu had taken out at the auction back then looked exactly the same as the real thing. It was normal for Song Yu to refuse to let go.

Qiao Nian looked at Song Yu and asked, “Little Sixth, come with me!”

When Song Yu heard Qiao Nian’s voice, she was slightly stunned. She looked up and met Qiao Nian’s gentle gaze. She blinked in confusion.

!!

Lu Qi’s stomach felt much better. At this moment, she hurriedly moved closer to Song Yu and said with a smile, “Sister Song Yu, let’s go listen to Second Brother’s new song.”

When Song Yu heard Lu Qi’s words, a gentle smile appeared on her face. However, she seemed to have thought of something and looked at Lu Nian not far away.

Lu Nian’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face, not even looking at her.

Song Yu pursed her lips slightly, feeling a little disappointed. She tried hard to put on a smile and said, “I’m about to enter the production team. I’ll start memorizing my lines now. You go on!”

However, after Song Yu finished speaking, she regretted it.

Actually, she liked Second Brother the most when he played the piano. At that time, Second Brother was gentlemanly and elegant. She couldn’t understand how he could play such a beautiful tune with just his hands.

Song Yu looked at Lu Nian and added with a smile, “I believe Second Brother’s music will definitely be very good!”

When Lu Nian heard Song Yu’s words, he said indifferently, “Memorize your lines well.”

Song Yu was speechless.

“Okay,” Song Yu agreed in disappointment.

Seeing Song Yu’s dejected expression, Lu Qi didn’t say anything else. She quickly walked to Qiao Nian’s side and took her arm. Smiling, she said, “Sister, let’s leave together.”

Qiao Nian agreed.

She felt that Song Yu’s attitude just now was a little strange. She turned around and saw the sadness in Song Yu’s eyes. Moreover, Song Yu’s gaze was fixed on Second Brother.

Qiao Nian frowned slightly. Why was Song Yu looking at Second Brother like this?

If she liked to listen to Second Brother’s piano music, she should follow him. Why did she reject her and Lu Qi’s suggestion?

What bothered Qiao Nian the most was that Song Yu’s gaze was very strange. She seemed to have seen this gaze somewhere before, but she couldn’t remember when.

Gu Zhou walked over to Qiao Nian. His attention had been on her the entire time. Seeing Qiao Nian’s worried expression, he asked, “What’s wrong?”

Qiao Nian smiled and shook her head, saying nothing.

Lu Qi was also standing beside Qiao Nian. She had just noticed that Qiao Nian had been looking at Song Yu. Puzzled, she asked, “Sister, were you looking at Sister Song Yu just now?”

Seeing that Lu Qi had asked so bluntly, Qiao Nian turned back to look at the other members of the Lu family. Seeing that they were some distance away from her, she lowered her voice and asked, “I don’t understand. What exactly is Song Yu’s relationship with Second Brother?”

She felt that the way a sister looked at her brother shouldn’t be like that.

Her sorrowful gaze was clearly the gaze of a person looking at their lover.

Qiao Nian’s expression changed slightly.

Could Song Yu…

Just now, Second Brother’s attitude towards Song Yu was also a little abnormal. It was not as if he was looking at his sister at all, as if he was treating Song Yu as a stranger.

Could it be that Second Brother had long understood Song Yu’s feelings for him?

Or had something else happened between the two of them?

When Lu Qi heard Qiao Nian’s question, she lowered her eyes slightly and thought for a while before saying in a low voice, “Second Brother and Sister Song Yu don’t seem to be on good terms. The two of them rarely speak!”

“Why do you say that?”

“Second Brother usually speaks more to the servants than to Sister Song Yu. I’ve never understood why Second Brother would treat Sister Song Yu like this. I even asked Second Brother, but he didn’t answer me. I don’t know what happened between the two of them!”

Qiao Nian casually comforted Lu Qi, feeling curious about the relationship between Second Brother and Song Yu.

Lu Qi frowned. Suddenly, he seemed to have thought of something. His eyes lit up and he said impatiently, “I remember now. Previously, Sister Song Yu seemed to have accidentally barged into Second Brother’s piano room and was scolded by Second Brother. Later, Sister Song Yu even went to your room and thought that your room was very beautiful, so she took a few more glances. At that time, Sister Song Yu still didn’t know your situation. At that time, Second Brother was also there. He and Sister Song Yu quarreled again because of this. Their relationship has always been so cold.”
