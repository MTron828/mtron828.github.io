suppressing his excitement, Director Lin decided to agree to Su Yan’s request. “Miss Qiao, since

“Uncle Lin!”

Before Director Lin could finish speaking, Qiao Nian spoke up.

Qiao Xin’s heart jumped to her throat. She stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian, an ominous feeling rising in her heart.

This country bumpkin had kept silent for so long. Why did she choose to speak up at this critical moment?

Qiao Xin had already cursed Qiao Nian to the core a thousand times over.

Su Yan’s eyes darkened. He could clearly sense that Director Lin was willing to work with them, but Qiao Nian had stepped forward and interrupted him.

Although Director Lin was also displeased that Qiao Nian had interrupted him, he couldn’t bear to berate Qiao Nian. Hence, he said, “Nian Nian, if you have anything to say, let’s talk about it later!”

The smile on Qiao Nian’s face didn’t falter. She said solemnly, “Uncle Lin, I have something to discuss with you.”

Director Lin instantly understood what Qiao Nian meant. He hesitated for a moment, caught in a dilemma.

“Qiao Nian, what exactly do you mean by that?” Su Yan couldn’t help but ask coldly. He was just about to gain the opportunity for collaboration, but Qiao Nian was ruining everything. “We’re talking about serious business. Do you even understand what serious business means?”

Qiao Nian’s methods were truly despicable. She was clearly trying to attract his attention through such low-down ways!

She was such a pathetic woman. She should learn from Qiao Xin. Only then would she realize the best way to show her love for him.

“T’ve heard that if one collaborates with Uncle Lin on this project, they can get a piece of land spanning fifty acres. I would like to garden on that piece of land, and cultivate the plants and flowers I like. As for medical equipment, I’ll find a third party to be a supplier. Would that be okay?”

Qiao Nian’s words made everyone burst into laughter.

“All the big shots in the medical field want to snatch that piece of land. And she dares to say that she wants to use that piece of land to garden. What a waste of a priceless treasure!”

“She must be a fool.”

“She’s indeed an unpresentable piece of goods! She clearly won’t amount to anything!”

An old man said gently, “Young lady, collaborating with Director Lin isn’t just a game. It won’t be like playing house. There are many factors involved in this. If you want to be involved, you have to take note of the occasion.”

Qiao Nian gave the old man another look, but said nothing.

The onlookers took this opportunity to continue humiliating Qiao Nian.

“If Mr. Su gets the opportunity for collaboration, his girlfriend, Qiao Xin, will definitely plant more Suranne Grass. This will be a great contribution to the country. Where did you get the guts to snatch this collaboration from Mr. Su?”

“It’s not wrong for young ladies to like plants, but those plants and flowers you like are all very cheap. Isn’t it embarrassing to say that you want to garden on that piece of land?”

“She’s truly overestimating her own abilities. What a fool! She’s just another country bumpkin.”

“If you ask me, you should hurry to the hospital to have your brain examined. I think it’s extremely likely that you have a screw loose.”

“They were both born to the same parents. How can the difference between them be so great!”

Qiao Xin stood there calmly. Listening to the people around her slandering Qiao Nian, she felt extremely smug.

Gu Zhou stood where he was, remaining silent. His gaze, as sharp as an eagle’s, swept across every single person who was slinging mud at Qiao Nian. He turned his head slightly and said to Chen Qing, “Have you remembered all of their names?”

Chen Qing could guess what Gu Zhou was planning to do. He nodded solemnly. “I’ve already memorized all their names.”

“Remember to give me the name list when you get back.” Gu Zhou pursed his thin lips.

“Yes, sir.”

At this moment, Chen Qing realized that President Gu had really fallen for Qiao Nian. Perhaps he didn’t know it himself.

“Heh!” Qiao Nian’s sneer stunned everyone.

Everyone’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Su Yan stepped forward, looking displeased. He glared at Qiao Nian and questioned, “What are you laughing at? Aren’t they telling the truth? Or do you want to continue pretending to be deaf and mute?”

Qiao Nian didn’t even bother granting Su Yan a glance as she walked towards the Suranne Grass..
