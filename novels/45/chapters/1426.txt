1427 Dislocated

Gu Zhou turned his head slightly and whispered into Chen Qing’s ear.

When Chen Qing heard this, he nodded. He already had a plan.

Chen Qing’s gaze fell on Lina’s face again. He seemed to have seen her somewhere before, but he couldn’t remember where.

Chen Qing walked up to Lina and said apologetically, “Miss, I’m really sorry about just now. I was in a hurry and accidentally bumped into you, causing you to be injured. Why don’t I send you to the hospital now?”

Lina had been looking down at her feet. In order to see Gu Zhou today, she had specially worn a pair of twelve-centimeter high heels. Usually, she did not dare to wear such high heels.

However, she didn’t know when her foot injury would recover. Lina still wanted to go to Bear Mountain with Qiao Nian tomorrow.

Lina took a deep breath and looked up at the person who had apologized to her. “It’s fine. I’ll be fine.”

When she noticed that the person in front of her was well-built, she was slightly stunned. This man’s figure was about the same as Gu Zhou’s. It was almost the perfect golden ratio. A trace of confusion flashed in her eyes.

What did the men in An City usually eat? Why were they all so muscular?

She had only been accidentally bumped by that man just now, but she had sprained her ankle and fallen.

With this thought in mind, Lina slowly lowered her head. Her gaze fell on her ankle. It was red and swollen.

Qiao Nian also noticed that Lina’s foot was swollen. She frowned slightly and lowered her head to touch Lina’s ankle. She heard Lina gasp.

“Nian Nian!” Lina stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian and said in a voice that only the two of them could hear, “I’ll go home and get a private doctor to take a look at me later. I’ll be fine.”

Qiao Nian shook her head gently and looked up at Lina. “I just took a closer look at your ankle. It should be dislocated. If I don’t treat it immediately, it’ll only hurt more and more. If you believe me, I can put it back in place now.”

Of course, Lina believed Qiao Nian’s words, but when the protagonist was dislocated in the television dramas she had watched in the past, the moment the doctor treated them, the protagonists were all in so much pain that they wanted to die.

She was the seventh princess of the European country. She represented the dignity of the royal family.

If Qiao Nian helped her reset her ankle now, wouldn’t she embarrass the royal family if she cried out in pain?

Moreover, she had just fallen. It was already very embarrassing.

Lina glanced around and saw that many people’s gazes were on her. She didn’t want to lose face in front of so many people.

Just as Lina was hesitating, a man’s apologetic voice came from the side.

“Miss, if you’re afraid of pain, why don’t you bite me? That way, you won’t scream.”

When Lina heard the man’s understanding words, a trace of shock flashed in her eyes. She looked up at the man in front of her in a daze.

Seeing this, Qiao Nian exerted strength and immediately relocated Lina’s dislocated ankle.

Lina sensed a pain in her foot and bit Chen Qing’s hand almost reflexively. She closed her eyes and waited for the intense pain to follow. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Sensing the pain in his arm, Chen Qing frowned and remained silent.

Qiao Nian had already treated Lina’s ankle. Smiling, she clapped her hands and stood up. “Alright, Lina, your ankle is fine now.”

What? She was fine so quickly?

Lina was slightly stunned. When she noticed that she was still biting the man’s hand, she hurriedly let go. She looked down and saw the clear bite mark on the man’s wrist.

Lina’s ears turned slightly red. She was the seventh princess of Europe. She actually bit someone’s wrist because she was afraid of pain.

It was the plots in the television dramas that had misled her. It was clearly just a little pain when the dislocated part was reset, and she could not feel any pain after it was reset.

The people in the television dramas were really acting. However she had bitten someone in public beacuse she was influenced by their acting.
