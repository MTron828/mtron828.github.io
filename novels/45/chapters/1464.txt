Dr. Ollie followed Qiao Nian’s footsteps. Seeing that Qiao Nian was about to give Lina the antidote, he reminded her seriously again, “You have to think carefully now. The Seventh Princess is poisoned. If you hand her over, those people will definitely give the Seventh Princess the antidote. But if you give her Chinese medicine now and the Chinese medicine is the antidote, the Seventh Princess will be fine.”

Dr. Ollie paused for a moment before continuing, “I’ll do my best to protect your life.”

In Dr. Ollie’s opinion, Qiao Nian’s acupuncture skills had reached the point of perfection. She was simply a genius in the medical field.

When Qiao Nian heard Dr. Ollie’s words, she understood that he was thinking for her. She smiled gratefully.

“Thank you!” Qiao Nian’s voice was very gentle, like the spring sun, making one feel comfortable. However, her tone was firm. “It’s just that I’ve already thought it through. I believe in the antidote I made!”

With that, Qiao Nian fed the antidote she had made to Lina without hesitation.

Dr. Ollie looked at Qiao Nian in surprise. Qiao Nian was really bold. She actually fed the medicine to the Seventh Princess without hesitation.

He raised his hand to look at the time on his wrist. The second hand ticked across the dial.

It had been a minute.

Two minutes had passed!

Dr. Ollie’s frown deepened, and his heart tightened. He looked at Qiao Nian’s face regretfully.

It seemed that Qiao Nian had already failed.

Dr. Ollie sighed heavily and turned to walk out.

Qiao Nian stayed by the bed, staring unblinkingly at the detector. Her clenched fists revealed her uneasy heart.

In the blink of an eye, ten hours had passed. The sky outside was already completely dark.

Wright stood calmly on the building opposite. Holding a telescope, he looked at the situation in the hospital, his lips curving up slightly.

There was going to be a good show to watch.

He just had to wait patiently for the president to come over and beg him to treat Lina’s illness.

At the thought of this, Wright couldn’t help but dance happily. Beautiful music flowed slowly through the room.

Seeing how happy Wright was, the assistant immediately said, “Congratulations, Prince. Your wish will come true immediately!”

“Thank you, Prince!” the assistant said happily. At this moment, his phone rang.

Wright stopped in his tracks and frowned. He looked at the assistant with a dark expression. “What exactly is it?”

“Madam Gu has already fed the Seventh Princess the antidote she made herself.” The assistant frowned and said solemnly, “Medicine can’t be taken casually. There are all kinds of toxins in the Seventh Princess’s body. Perhaps the poison in her body has already mutated. We have to quickly think of another way!”

When Wright heard his assistant’s words, his expression instantly darkened. He gritted his teeth and said, “That woman is simply courting death. She dares to give Lina random medicine. If anything happens to Lina, the first thing I’ll do is kill her!”

Wright was in a terrible mood. The beautiful music had turned into a death march in his ears. He looked angrily at the man playing the violin not far away and said with a dark expression, “Get lost. Get out now!”

The man playing the violin immediately disappeared from the room, afraid that he would be killed if he was any later.

Wright panted heavily and looked at the hospital opposite with red-rimmed eyes. Although he wanted to use Lina, he still had her in his heart.

If Lina was really dead, he might never let himself off for the rest of his life.

At this moment, the atmosphere in the hospital garden became tense again.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com
