1370 Senior Brother

Lu Qi’s tears fell one by one. She touched Qin Chuan’s face. This was the second time Qin Chuan had saved her.

The first time, she had almost been killed by Jiang Chi. It was Qin Chuan who had rushed in desperately to save her.

This time, Qin Chuan used his body as a protective shield for her.

That wasn’t right.

Qin Chuan was using his life to exchange for hers.

Lu Qi looked at Qin Chuan with teary eyes. She raised her hand to wipe the dust off Qin Chuan’s face, but there was still blood on her hand. Worried that it would dirty Qin Chuan’s face, she stopped.

She stared unblinkingly at Qin Chuan’s nose. After thinking for a long time, she placed her trembling hand under his nose.

Sensing Qin Chuan’s weak breath, she cried tears of joy. She looked around, looking for something to support the roof of the pillar.

But this car wasn’t hers. She was trapped in the front passenger seat now, and couldn’t find anything suitable to support the roof.

“Senior, Senior, wake up!” Lu Qi didn’t know what to do now either. She could only wake Qin Chuan up and ask him to help think of a solution. He was familiar with his car. He would definitely think of another way out.

Lu Qi unbuckled her seatbelt and placed her hands on the roof of the car, wanting to relieve the pressure on Qin Chuan. However, she was too weak to support Qin Chuan at all.

Lu Qi moved closer to Qin Chuan’s face and shouted anxiously, “Qin Chuan, Qin Chuan, wake up!”

Her sharp eyes saw Qin Chuan frown. Her eyes were instantly filled with hope. It seemed that Qin Chuan could really hear her voice.

“Qin Chuan!” Lu Qi called out excitedly again. Her hand couldn’t help but stroke Qin Chuan’s face. “Senior Brother, don’t sleep anymore. Wake up!”

…

There was a long tunnel with dim yellow lights flickering around it. He could see the light ahead from afar.

With his hand in his pocket, Qin Chuan walked towards the bright hole.

The only sound in the tunnel was the sound of his leather shoes stepping on the ground. The sound wandered through the entire tunnel.

Just as Qin Chuan was about to reach the entrance of the cave, he suddenly heard Lu Qi’s anxious voice.

“Qin Chuan!”

“Senior!”

“Stop sleeping. Wake up!”

Qin Chuan could hear the anxiety in Lu Qi’s voice. He frowned slightly and stood rooted to the ground, looking around, as if he wanted to determine where Lu Qi was.

At this moment, a figure appeared at the entrance of the cave. The figure’s back was facing the light. He narrowed his eyes slightly. When he saw the face outside clearly, his lips curved up slightly.

It was Lu Qi.

Qin Chuan’s eyes were filled with laughter. He walked towards Lu Qi. “Qi Qi.”

Outside the tunnel, Lu Qi only smiled. Then, she walked out, as if she wanted to bring him out with her.

“Qi Qi, wait for me.” Qin Chuan called Lu Qi’s name, but Lu Qi continued walking out as if she hadn’t heard anything.

When Qin Chuan walked to the entrance of the tunnel, Lu Qi, who was not far away, turned to look at him. A bright smile appeared on her face as she said, “Senior Brother.”

Qin Chuan was a little dazed by the bright smile on Lu Qi’s face. In his memory, Lu Qi rarely smiled at him like this.

Lu Qi waved at Qin Chuan with a sweet smile on her face. She tilted her head and asked, “Senior Brother, I’m really looking forward to worshiping our ancestors with you. Let’s go now!”

“Okay.” As Qin Chuan spoke, he was about to take a step forward when the sound of a woman crying came from the depths of the tunnel.

He retracted his foot and turned back to look into the tunnel.

“Senior Brother Qin Chuan. Sob, sob. Wake up quickly. Sob, I’m so afraid. It’s so dark here. Qin Chuan, wake up quickly, okay?”

It was Lu Qi’s sobbing voice.

Qin Chuan frowned. He looked into the depths of the tunnel. Lu Qi’s crying voice came from the depths of the tunnel again.

“Senior, I’m so afraid! Please wake up, okay?”

Qin Chuan was a little puzzled. Lu Qi was clearly standing in front of him. Why was Lu Qi’s voice still deep in the tunnel?

Qin Chuan looked at Lu Qi outside the tunnel again. There was a bright smile on her face, and her eyes were filled with gentleness.

He took a step back.

That wasn’t right. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The person in front of him was not Lu Qi.

Lu Qi’s eyes were filled with mischief. It was impossible for her to smile like this.

Qin Chuan looked into the depths of the tunnel. Lu Qi’s sobbing voice came from inside.

“Senior, Qin Chuan, don’t leave me alone. I’ve been afraid of the dark since I was young…”

That’s right. This was Lu Qi’s voice.

Lu Qi’s voice came from the depths of the tunnel.
