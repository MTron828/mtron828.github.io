Chapter 381: How Could It Be You?

Oh no.

Everything was over!

Brother Ah Zhou was definitely suspecting her.

Jiang Yue retracted her gaze aggrievedly. Her gaze fell on Qin Lu’s face and she asked dryly, “How could it be you?”

Qin Lu was also on the verge of breaking down. She had clearly set Qiao Nian up, but for some reason, she had implicated Qin Lu.

“Ah!” Qin Lu hugged her head and screamed as she rambled on. “It wasn’t me, it definitely wasn’t me! I was in the hall on the first floor! Why did it become me?”

For so many years, Qin Lu had been carefully taking care of her body. She had fantasized that one day, she would be able to use her young and beautiful body to enter a rich family.

But now, she had been ruined by a lowly waiter.

Qin Lu could not accept this fact. She broke down in tears and tugged at her hair tightly. “Why did it become me? Why…”

Looking at Qin Lu’s pained expression, Jiang Yue instantly understood.

Qiao Nian must have seen through Qin Lu’s scheme and schemed against her.

This was indeed a brilliant move.

Strange, where had Li Kun gone?

......

Jiang Yue thought of Li Kun and gradually calmed down.

As long as there was a chance, she would trample Qiao Nian under her feet.

If this room was a smokescreen set up by Qiao Nian, and in reality, Qiao Nian and Li Kun were doing this in another room…

If she hadn’t been smart and cautious, Qiao Nian might have really dodged the bullet.

Jiang Yue looked at Qin Lu coldly and questioned loudly, “Where’s Qiao Nian? Didn’t you say that Qiao Nian was here to rest?”

Qin Lu was still in a state of a breakdown and couldn’t hear Jiang Yue’s words at all.

“Miss Jiang, are you looking for me?”

A cold voice came from the door.

When Jiang Yue heard this voice, her heart jumped to her throat. She turned around and saw Qiao Nian leaning lazily against the door.

A faint smile appeared on Qiao Nian’s face. Her charming fox-like eyes narrowed slightly as she looked at her disdainfully.

Jiang Yue clenched her fists involuntarily, her nails digging into her palms.

Strange.

Why was Qiao Nian’s clothes neat and her expression normal? She didn’t look like she had been humiliated at all. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Jiang Yue’s heart instantly sank to the bottom. She lowered her gaze slightly. When she opened her eyes again, she quickly walked up to Qiao Nian and sized her up with concern. Pretending to be intimate, she took Qiao Nian’s hand and said softly, “Second Sister-in-law, as long as you’re fine, everything’s fine. Brother Ah Zhou and I are both very worried about you!”

The smile on Qiao Nian’s face didn’t change, and the disdain in her eyes became even more obvious. She retracted her hand indifferently and said, “What are you worried about?”

Jiang Yue choked on her words.

Qiao Nian continued, “Are you worried that I won’t fool around with other men and ruin my reputation?”

Jiang Yue’s expression froze. She frowned slightly and asked pitifully, “Second Sister-in-law, why did you say that?”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he roughly understood what had happened.

Someone must be plotting against Qiao Nian.

However, in the end, Qin Lu was implicated.

From what Qin Lu had said just now, Qin Lu should have been involved as well. However, she had reaped what she had sown.

In an instant, Jiang Yue felt the temperature around her drop. The air felt a little suffocating. She looked at Qiao Nian’s face and shuddered.

Jiang Yue’s gaze inadvertently fell on Gu Zhou’s face, and then she met Gu Zhou’s sinister eyes.

Jiang Yue’s heart raced.

No, she couldn’t mess around.

As long as she pushed all the blame to Qin Lu, her innocence would have nothing to do with her.

Just as Jiang Yue was about to explain, Qin Lu’s hysterical roar came from inside the room. “Qiao Nian, you despicable b*tch! How dare you scheme against me!!!”

At this moment, Qin Lu had already put on her clothes. She looked at Qiao Nian with hatred written all over her face. If looks could kill, Qiao Nian would have died a thousand times over.
