1106 Not Simple

Qiao Nian had also guessed what Gu Zhou was thinking, but she could also understand his thoughts. At that time, Gu Zhou had received too much unfair treatment. Moreover, Gu Zhou had come to An City that night because of his eldest brother’s invitation.

If this had happened to her, she would have thought the same as Gu Zhou.

However, Song Man’s appearance made them realize that what happened on the 15th of August six years ago was not simple.

They were like chess pieces that were casually manipulated by those people!

Gu Zhou continued, “All these years, I’ve been looking for my brother. I wanted to ask what exactly happened back then, but now I realize that what happened back then might not have anything to do with my brother. We were all schemed against by those people!”

It was precisely because of this investigation that Gu Zhou realized that his brother had been silently protecting him from behind!

Qin Chuan and Qiao Nian didn’t speak. Only Gu Zhou knew the Gu family’s situation best!

“I think we can eliminate my brother as a suspect now, because those people kidnapped Nian’er back then. At that time, my brother was still a child. It’s impossible for him to do such a thing!”

Gu Zhou paused for a moment and continued, “In my parents’ generation, the Gu family offended many people. I remember that when my parents first got married, they received many threatening letters and threatening items. I think if they wanted to take revenge on our family, they would have done so back then. Now, my parents have long divorced. If they take revenge on us now and make Big Brother disappear, their goal will have been achieved. However, what I don’t understand is why those people still want to take Nian’er and my children away.”

Gu Zhou’s words were like a bolt of lightning that woke Qiao Nian up! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Could it be an enemy of the Lu family?

If they were enemies of the Lu family, why did those people only scheme against her?

Without waiting for Qiao Nian to think it through, Gu Zhou continued, “I found Gu Qi by Wang Lin’s side. Xiao Shi was raised by Song Man. At that time, Song Man’s goal should have been to impersonate the person who was with me six years ago. She wanted to marry into the Gu family and pretend to be you to become the eldest daughter of the Lu family!”

Gu Zhou paused for a moment. “There’s also something wrong with Song Man’s identity. She’s the adopted daughter of the Song family. It’s a little difficult to investigate Song Man’s identity. We can only do a test with her DNA. It’s easy to investigate Wang Lin. The Wang family is just an ordinary family. They don’t have the ability to set up such a big scheme, let alone replace Nian’er’s child silently. Although we can eliminate the possibility that the Wang family is the mastermind, the Wang family might know some clues!”

“You’re right. They must have other motives for taking my children away.” Qiao Nian nodded in agreement and continued, “Song Man committed suicide back then to protect those people. The clues are cut off here. However, I’m certain that our last child should be in the hands of those people!”

Gu Zhou narrowed his eyes, his gaze cold. “They should be doing something else. Song Man took the initiative to step forward, but I don’t know when they’ll take the next step! But our child is in their hands. They’ll definitely use that child!”

“I hope that they’ll make a move as soon as possible. That way, I might be able to see my child as soon as possible. But I’m very worried that they might not have done anything in the past few years!” Qiao Nian pursed her lips, her heart filled with fear and unease. “More than twenty years ago, they kidnapped me. Six years ago, they took my child away. Those people are very patient. I’m really afraid that it’ll be decades before they let our child appear!”

Qiao Nian clenched her fists tightly on her knees. At first, she had simply thought that those people only wanted her bone marrow. Why did they still kidnap her child?

No matter what those people wanted to do, she felt that they should start investigating the enemies of the Lu family.

If she could remember what had happened when she was kidnapped, many problems would be solved!

Song Man had transplanted her bone marrow. In other words, she had undergone a bone marrow transplant after she was kidnapped. Then, she would definitely have seen doctors and nurses. Those people should have helped her recuperate well. Otherwise, there would have been something wrong with her body long ago.
