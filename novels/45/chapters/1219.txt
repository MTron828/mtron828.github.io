“We really have to prepare the will again. I don’t want you to suffer.” Boss Jin looked at Jiang Yue with heartache. If he told these words to other women, they would be so happy that they would jump up and down. They wouldn’t have time to care about him.

But his Yue’er was different. Her eyes were only filled with him. He knew that Yue’er must really like him.

“But…” Jiang Yue said hesitantly.

“I’ll arrange the will. You don’t have to worry.” Boss Jin interrupted Jiang Yue. This was the first time he had seen someone not focus on money. His Yue’er was indeed not those women who smelled of money. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

His Yue’er was a lotus flower that was untainted by mud.

This time, Jiang Yue was completely certain that Boss Jin was telling the truth. She frowned and said softly, “What about your wife? I…”

“Why are you mentioning that b*tch again?” Boss Jin’s expression darkened as he said unhappily.

Jiang Yue hurriedly lowered her head and apologized obediently. “Then I won’t mention it again!”

Boss Jin’s heart softened just by looking at an obedient, beautiful, and loving girl like Jiang Yue.

Boss Jin’s lips curved up. He moved closer to Jiang Yue’s lips and kissed her lightly. “When we go back this time, I’ll divorce her. Then, I’ll marry you in a grand manner! I’ll hold a wedding of the century for you!”

Jiang Yue looked at Boss Jin in shock, her eyes filled with surprise. Her heart was beating wildly, as if it would jump out of her mouth in the next second. She couldn’t believe that Boss Jin was willing to marry her.

Boss Jin looked at Jiang Yue’s silly expression and couldn’t help but laugh. His woman was really obedient and adorable. No matter how he looked at her, he couldn’t get tired of her.

“Are you frightened?” Boss Jin asked with a smile.

Jiang Yue nodded obediently and asked in disbelief, “Are you serious?”

The smile on Boss Jin’s face deepened. Looking at Jiang Yue’s innocent and harmless face, his heart seemed to be filled with something. He said softly, “A gentleman never goes back on his word.”

Jiang Yue was stunned for a moment before she smiled and said sweetly, “Then should I change the way I address you in the future?”

“Yes?”

“Hubby.” As Jiang Yue spoke, she took the initiative to kiss Boss Jin’s face.

Boss Jin’s face was filled with a happy smile as he pulled Jiang Yue into his arms again.

Jiang Yue stayed obediently in Boss Jin’s arms. Qiao Nian’s face appeared in her mind again, and a trace of killing intent flashed in her eyes.

Boss Jin naturally didn’t know what Jiang Yue was thinking. He looked down at Jiang Yue in his arms. Her skin was fair, like a peeled egg.

He recalled the first time he had seen Jiang Yue. At that time, Jiang Yue’s face was half angel and half demon.

At the airport, he was about to return to the company when he had a heart attack and fell to the ground.

His assistant hurriedly called the ambulance.

When he was lying on the ground, he was still a little conscious. A sense of desolation surged in his heart.

He still wanted to live. He didn’t want to die like this.

At this moment, a woman walked out of the crowd.

He was still looking at the woman in a daze. The woman was so beautiful that she seemed unreal. He thought that an angel had come to pick him up.

Only half of the woman’s face was exposed, but the other half was covered by a mask. She walked up to him and squatted down.

“Hello, sir. Can you hear me?”

The woman’s voice was gentle, making one feel as if they were bathing in a spring breeze.

Boss Jin’s eyelids grew heavier and heavier. Then, he fainted, no longer knowing anything.

When he woke up, he was in the ward, his assistant by his side.

Seeing that he had woken up, the assistant hurriedly asked the doctor to examine his body. When the doctor confirmed that his body was different, he heaved a sigh of relief and spoke to him.

“Mr. Jin, when you were at the airport, it was fortunate that a doctor had taken emergency measures for you in advance. Otherwise, the consequences would have been unimaginable. Although you’re much better, you still need to recuperate.”

After sending the doctor off, he found out from his assistant that the woman in the half-mask had given him first aid before pulling him back from the Grim Reaper.
