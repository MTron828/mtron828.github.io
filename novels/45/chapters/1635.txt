Chapter 1636 Refusal to Speak

Qiao Nian could tell that Annie was on the verge of breaking down. As long as Annie accidentally said something wrong, she could turn Mark into a suspect and lock him up.

Annie looked at Qiao Nian with a dark expression. She was panting heavily, like a trapped beast. Her lips trembled slightly as she said loudly, "No, no, my father didn't do it. I did it all alone."

"Annie, you're just an ordinary princess. How can you control a general and make him work for you?" Qiao Nian clenched her fists tightly and looked at Annie nervously. She was waiting for Annie to make a mistake.

"Cui Qi… Cui Qi admires me, so Cui Qi would do such a thing to save me!" Towards the end, Annie couldn't help but laugh, as if she had found the perfect excuse to absolve her father, Mark. "So, Cui Qi will listen to whatever I say. Haha, Qiao Nian, stop talking. I'll never give you the answer you want."

Annie was determined to blame herself for all the crimes. No matter what, she would not betray Mark.

When Qiao Nian heard Annie's words, she understood what she meant.

Annie wanted to take all the blame. She wanted to get Mark out of this.

"You…"

Before Annie could finish speaking, she met Qiao Nian's sympathetic eyes. Her heart seemed to be clenched tightly by a hand.

She didn't dare to look into Qiao Nian's eyes. She turned to look at the President beside her and said in a melancholic voice, "Mr. President, it's because I can't stand the fact that there's a sickly Madam President in Europe. I can't stand the fact that Lina, who's average and stupid, is a princess. Such people are an eyesore so I want to kill them. Now that the evidence is conclusive and I've already admitted it, what else do you want to ask me?"

Annie paused, then said, "I won't say anything else."

When the president heard Annie's words, he took a deep breath and tried to suppress the anger in his heart. Annie had actually used such nonsense to get him to close the case.

Mark. Hehe, Mark was really capable. He actually had such a loyal daughter who was always thinking for him.

The President's frown deepened. He looked at Annie coldly and said nothing for a long time.

For so many years, he had been suppressed by Mark. Even if he did not have any real power, it did not matter. As long as the people of Europe could live well, he did not want to make things too ugly with his brother. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

But now, all of that was different.

His wife and daughter had been bullied to such an extent, but he did not have the ability to protect them.

The president slowly lowered his gaze. He could never accept that his wife and daughter had been bullied!!!

Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou could both sense that the president was really angry. They exchanged a look and saw helplessness in each other's eyes. They really hadn't expected Annie to be so crazy. For Mark, she was willing to kill in front of everyone.

All their plans had been ruined by Annie. This court session had to end.

The president looked up again, his azure eyes filled with coldness. He looked at Annie in front of him and said coldly, "Take her away."

Annie's lips curved into a wide smile. Her gaze gradually moved from the president's face to Mark's. The smile on her face faltered slightly.

Father.

She had never expected her father to look at her so coldly, as if she should have done all of this. To him, she had just done what she should have done.There wasn't anything worthy to be proud of.

Annie's heart sank and shattered into countless pieces.

Annie slowly closed her eyes and was dragged out by the guard.

Retribution. It was really retribution!

She had just said that Cui Qi was useless and should be killed.

The current her was also a useless person to her father.

Annie burst into tears. Her sobs sounded extremely miserable.

After Annie was pulled away, the courtroom finally quietened down. Mark slowly stood up and walked towards the president.
