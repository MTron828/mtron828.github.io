906 I’m Sorry

As Qiao Nian spoke, she walked towards the stairs.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian’s back and narrowed his phoenix-like eyes. “Xiao Shi just fell asleep.”

Qiao Nian’s right foot had just stepped onto the stairs when she heard Gu Zhou’s words. She retracted her foot and lowered her gaze, saying casually, “I have something on at the company…”

As Qiao Nian spoke, she walked out.

If it weren’t for Xiao Shi, she wouldn’t have been willing to return to the Gu family.

However, before she could take a few steps, Gu Zhou blocked her path.

Qiao Nian looked up and met Gu Zhou’s gaze.

“I have something on now. I…”

“What kind of person do you think Xiao Qi and Xiao Shi’s biological mother are?” Gu Zhou stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian, interrupting her gently.

Qiao Nian took a step back and shook her head. “Their biological mother? How would I know what kind of person she is?”

At this point, Qiao Nian recalled that night and the pain she had suffered during childbirth.

Qiao Nian clenched her fists. She looked up at Gu Zhou and asked, “I’ve always been curious. What kind of person do you think their biological mother is?”

Gu Zhou saw Qiao Nian’s small actions. His eyes flickered as he said seriously, “I think… she must be a very smart and kind person.”

Qiao Nian raised her eyebrows slightly. “Why?”

“Xiao Shi and Gu Qi are both very smart. Moreover, they didn’t go astray when they were by Song Man’s side. That’s really commendable.” Gu Zhou paused for a moment and continued, “That can only mean that Xiao Shi is naturally kind. This kind of kindness should be inherited by her bloodline!”

At the mention of Xiao Shi, Qiao Nian’s eyes gradually softened. “Yes, it’s like this…”

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian’s face. Guilt and self-reproach gradually appeared in his eyes.

Gu Zhou pursed his lips and finally said, “If I could do it again, I definitely won’t hurt her!”

Qiao Nian came back to her senses. Her eyes flickered as she looked up at Gu Zhou. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

That night, Gu Zhou had also been drugged. Moreover, Gu Zhou seemed to have suffered from a mental illness because of that incident.

This incident had traumatized her and Gu Zhou greatly.

Gu Zhou was also unwilling.

Gu Zhou had a phobia of women. Gu Zhou did not have a phobia when facing her.

Qiao Nian also understood that what happened that night had been deliberately planned.

Putting everything else aside, back then, when she fell into Qiao Xin’s trap, she might have lost her virginity to an old man.

However, those people brought her to Gu Zhou’s room.

For the entire night.

She had spent her life in fear and pain.

That night had been a nightmare for her.

Qiao Nian closed her eyes and suppressed all the emotions in her heart. She looked up at Gu Zhou and tried hard to remain calm. “If we find her, how do you want to make it up to her?”

Gu Zhou stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian and said seriously, “I wanted to marry her and redeem myself for the crimes I’ve committed!”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she was stunned.

After a long time, she came back to her senses and asked with a frown, “Do you really think so?”

Gu Zhou nodded seriously. He looked at Qiao Nian gently and smiled self-deprecatingly. “But it’s different now. After meeting you, I just want to marry you. However, I’ll still do my best to find her and atone for my sins in other ways!”

Qiao Nian’s heart began to race. She lowered her gaze.

So he hadn’t forgotten to look for her back then. He had always been protecting her.

At this moment, Qiao Nian’s mind was in a mess.

Suddenly, a maid ran down the stairs and ran up to Qiao Nian. She said in a panic, “Young Madam, Little Miss has woken up from her tears. She keeps calling for Mommy!”

When Qiao Nian heard the servant say that she had cried , her heart jumped to her throat. She turned around and ran upstairs, leaving Gu Zhou standing alone.

Gu Zhou watched as Qiao Nian left. What had happened that night flashed across his mind, and his brow furrowed deeper and deeper. The light in his eyes gradually disappeared, and his eyes were filled with self-blame.

Nian’er…

I’m sorry…
