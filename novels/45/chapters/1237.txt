1238 A Mistaken Thought

Jiang Yue thought of Zhao Qian.

Zhao Qian wasn’t good-looking, and she was a little stupid. Usually, when she casually curled her finger, Zhao Qian would approach her.

What amused Jiang Yue the most was that someone like Zhao Qian actually dared to fall for Gu Zhou!

Jiang Yue remembered very clearly that in order to make Gu Zhou hate Zhao Qian, she encouraged Zhao Qian to get close to Gu Zhou every day.

Indeed, Gu Zhou did not treat Zhao Qian well. However, Zhao Qian regretted it not long after and obediently became an ostrich.

Perhaps it was because of Zhao Qian that Jiang Yue felt very happy. There was no discomfort at all.

Jiang Yue had always felt that Zhao Qian would definitely become a tool used by the Gu family for marriage in the future. Hence, she had tried her best to please Grandma, hoping that Grandma would take pity on her and let her marry Gu Zhou.

But Grandma…

Qiao Nian looked at Jiang Yue’s ferocious expression and continued, “When you were in the Gu family, even if Gu Zhou didn’t like you, Grandma treated you sincerely and doted on you. But you…”

Panting heavily, Jiang Yue glared at Qiao Nian angrily.

It had been a long time since she had seen Grandma. This was also the first time she had been separated from her for so long.

She wondered how Grandma was doing.

However, when Jiang Yue thought of Matriarch Gu chasing her out of the house for Qiao Nian, she felt the anger burn her heart. She gritted her teeth and said, “Shut up!”

Matriarch Gu was a heartless old woman. She chased her out of the house.

Seeing this, Qiao Nian’s expression turned cold. “Grandma doted on you. She gave you everything Gu Zhou had. You’re a top student from a famous school, and your medical skills are not bad. If you made good use of everything you had, your future would have been bright. However, you abandoned your career. All you think about is dealing with me!”

At this point, Qiao Nian paused for a moment and continued, “Do you think Grandma doesn’t know the secretive things you did?”

She smiled mockingly and said, “Actually, Grandma already knows. Grandma also knows that you were the one who poisoned her. She gave you a chance, but you personally cut ties with her. The reason why you’ve become like this now is all because you asked for it. It has nothing to do with anyone else!”

“Shut up! What do you know? You don’t know anything, but you’re spouting nonsense beside me!” Jiang Yue looked up, wishing she could tear Qiao Nian’s chattering mouth apart. “I’ve been by the old witch’s side for so many years. Every day, I’ve been trembling in fear and trying my best to serve her. In the end, she chased me out just for an outsider like you!”

The more Jiang Yue spoke, the sadder she became. Her eyes turned red. “Grandma handed all her inheritance to an outsider like you. I’m clearly the closest person to Grandma, but Grandma doesn’t trust me. I’ve become like this because of you. If I were still the young lady of the Gu family, who would dare to bully me?”

Jiang Yue seemed to have gone into a dead end. Anger surged in her heart as she said angrily, “I originally wanted to you to pay an eye for an eye, but I’ve changed my mind!”

Jiang Yue was an ingrate. She could not be raised well at all! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“If I ruin your face, you’ll return to your original state in the future.” Jiang Yue took a step forward and walked up to Qiao Nian. Looking at Qiao Nian’s face, she snorted. “If I turn you into a human swine, you’ll be my test subject. I’ll definitely make good use of you!”

Seeing that Qiao Nian wasn’t afraid at all, Jiang Yue frowned and said to the bodyguard beside her, “Takeda, tie her up now. When the time comes, buy a big fish tank that can hold a person. I want to cut off her limbs and ruin her face. I want to raise her in the fish tank for the rest of her life for me to admire!”

When Takeda heard Jiang Yue’s words, he shivered slightly. Miss Jiang Yue was really too terrifying. Fortunately, he did not make an enemy of her.

Takeda swiftly brought over the rope he had prepared and walked up to Qiao Nian, as if he was going to tie her up in the next moment.

Qiao Nian’s gaze was like a sharp blade as she glared at Takeda.
