Chapter 706: Rebirth Flower

Qiao Nian cleared her throat and continued, “Everyone knows that I’m a doctor. Moreover, I’ve raised many expensive plants. In Chinese medicine, hyacinths are very valuable.”

“Hyacinths have a unique fragrance. This fragrance can relax the mind, stabilize one’s emotions, and relieve one’s fatigue. Previously, I made a perfume that was mainly made of hyacinths. Later on, many perfumes on the market were made of hyacinths.”

Back when Qiao Nian was locked up in the mental hospital, she had been completely depressed and couldn’t control her emotions. At one time, she had even suffered from depression.

After that, she planted some hyacinths to relieve her emotions. Her condition gradually improved. That was when she made the perfume that hyacinths were made of.

When everyone heard Qiao Nian’s words, no one questioned her.

Qiao Nian’s medical skills were very brilliant.

Previously, when Matriarch Gu had been poisoned, the doctor had already given the diagnosis of a critical illness. It was Qiao Nian who had taken another path to save Matriarch Gu.

Qiao Nian also helped Gu Zhou recuperate. Gu Zhou’s health was already much better than before, and the frequency of his relapses was getting lower and lower.

Qiao Nian had even been invited to be a lecturer at the medical school. She had even cultivated medicinal herbs that were worth tens of thousands.

Later on, when Qiao Nian was at the temple, she accidentally bumped into Lu Qi and Matriarch Gu. She could even tell that Matriarch Lu’s health wasn’t good. At that time, Qiao Nian didn’t even take Matriarch Lu’s pulse. Just by looking at Matriarch Lu’s expression, she was certain that Matriarch Lu was sick.

When Jiang Yue heard Qiao Nian’s words, the confusion in her eyes grew more and more obvious. She asked, “Since you know about the Hyacinth so well, you should know its flower symbolism. Then why did you make up a lie and say that it represents rebirth?”

Jiang Yue was also a medical student and knew a lot about Chinese medicine. She knew the value of hyacinths, but no one had ever said that hyacinths represented rebirth.

“In the cultivation world, hyacinths only represent rebirth. As I’ve said before, its flowering period is only three to four months. If it wants to bloom again, it needs to be trimmed and all the branches that have withered before need to be cut off. Only then can it continue to bloom beautiful flowers, so it represents rebirth!”

Some things could only be understood by professionals.

At this moment, when Jiang Yue heard Qiao Nian’s words, she felt a little ashamed of herself.

She had always felt that she was very outstanding. There weren’t many girls in this world who were more outstanding than her, but when she faced Qiao Nian, she felt inferior.

Why?

Jiang Yue felt that she had worked very hard in the past.

In the past, she had worked hard to learn how to play the piano and the violin. For Brother Ah Zhou and Grandma’s illnesses, she had even specially studied Chinese medicine. She had even studied law.

In the past, she had been forced by her grandmother to study non-stop. She had no freedom. Today, she was doing nothing but studying. However, in the end, she didn’t know as much as Qiao Nian, a wild girl.

Everyone’s time was the same. Why did Qiao Nian have so much energy to play the violin so well? Her medical skills were also so brilliant. Her status in the cultivation world was also so high.

Previously, she had heard that the stone wall painting Qiao Nian had drawn when she was in her teens had shocked the entire An City.

Why did the heavens treat Qiao Nian so well?

She refused to concede defeat.

Jiang Yue’s lips moved slightly as she said, “I think you’re lying about the Hyacinth…”

“Shut up!” Matriarch Lu interrupted Jiang Yue mercilessly, her eyes tinged with anger.

When Jiang Yue heard Matriarch Lu’s words, she was so frightened that her heart skipped a beat. She looked at Matriarch Lu in disbelief and said, “Grandma Lu, actually, I just wanted to say…”

Suppressing her anger, Matriarch Lu looked at Jiang Yue with disappointment. She had watched Jiang Yue grow up.

She had never expected Jiang Yue to insist on causing trouble on the anniversary of her eldest granddaughter’s death. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Matriarch Lu frowned and asked, “Enough, stop talking!”

“Grandma Lu, I’m doing this for the sake of the eldest daughter of the Lu family!”
