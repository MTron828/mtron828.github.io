1365 Uneasiness

Qiao Nian stopped in her tracks in shock and looked at the news on the television in shock. At this moment, the news had already switched to an advertisement encouraging people to give birth. However, the collapse of the Wang Village tunnel had already become a text under the television.

The tunnel to Wang Village.

When she woke up this morning, she heard from Qin Chuan that he wanted to bring Lu Qi back to the Spirit Village to pay respects to her ancestors.

From An City to Spirit Village, they had to go through the Wang Village Tunnel!

Qiao Nian narrowed her eyes, which were filled with seriousness. She hurriedly took out her phone, her fingers trembling slightly as she called Qin Chuan.

However, she couldn’t get through to Qin Chuan at all. She called Lu Qi again, but she couldn’t get through to her either. She called the Lu family butler and found out that Lu Qi had gone out in the morning.

No way!

There was definitely nothing wrong with Qin Chuan and Lu Qi. The two of them would definitely not be in the Wang Village Tunnel!

How could the two of them, who were so lucky, encounter such an unlucky thing like the collapse of the tunnel?

Although Qiao Nian tried her best to comfort herself and tell herself that Qin Chuan and Lu Qi wouldn’t be in the tunnel, she still felt that it was very likely that the two of them were under the tunnel.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but tremble. Her legs gave way. Supporting herself on the sofa, she forced herself to stand up straight, staring unblinkingly at the news on the television.

This wouldn’t do. She had to call Qin Chuan and Lu Qi. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Qiao Nian leaned back on the sofa and took out her phone to call Qin Chuan, but the call still couldn’t go through.

“Nian Nian?” Seeing Qiao Nian’s pale face and purple lips, Matriarch Gu frowned. She hurriedly walked over and asked worriedly, “What’s wrong? Why do you look so pale?”

Qiao Nian looked at her cell phone with red-rimmed eyes. She began to call Lu Qi again, but she couldn’t get through either.

At this moment, Matriarch Gu heard footsteps on the stairs. She looked up and saw that it was Gu Zhou. She hurriedly said anxiously, “Ah Zhou, come quickly. Nian Nian looks like something’s wrong!”

Gu Zhou quickly walked up to Qiao Nian and saw that she was on the phone again. He pulled Qiao Nian into his arms and asked worriedly, “Nian’er, are you feeling unwell?”

Matriarch Gu was so anxious that beads of sweat broke out on her forehead. She said worriedly, “I’ll call the family doctor over now.”

“Grandma, there’s no need. I’m fine.” Qiao Nian was so anxious that her eyes were red, and her tears were about to fall. Her voice trembled as she repeated, “I’m really fine.”

“You don’t look fine now.” Gu Zhou helped Qiao Nian sit on the sofa and said worriedly, “Let the doctor take a look at you.”

“The Wang Village Tunnel has collapsed…” Qiao Nian’s voice trembled. She lowered her head and continued to call Qin Chuan and Lu Qi in turn. However, she couldn’t get through to them.

Gu Zhou looked at the name Qiao Nian had called. What else didn’t he understand? His expression instantly darkened. “Are the two of them inside?”

Qiao Nian’s lips trembled as she panted heavily. “I-I’m not sure…”

No matter how Qiao Nian called Qin Chuan and Lu Qi, she still couldn’t get through to them. Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou and said with a trembling voice, “But…”

Tears welled up in Qiao Nian’s eyes. She tried hard to remain calm.

Neither Qin Chuan nor Lu Qi’s phones could be reached. If only she could get through to one of them.

The tunnel in Wang Village was about ten kilometers long. There was no signal in the tunnel, so it made sense for her to not be able to get through.

If Qin Chuan and Lu Qi really arrived at the spirit village, the signal there was good and she would not be able to get through to them.

Qiao Nian’s cell phone trembled as she tried hard to make a call. She tried hard to convince herself that nothing had happened to Qin Chuan and Lu Qi, but she was still afraid that they were in the tunnel.

Qiao Nian’s pearl-like tears fell one by one, wetting the screen. Ignoring everything else, she continued to make calls.

Gu Zhou patted Qiao Nian’s back comfortingly and called out upstairs, “Chen Qing.”

Chen Qing had been helping Gu Zhou organize the information on MY’s HH Corporation. When he heard Gu Zhou’s voice, he hurriedly put down his work and quickly walked downstairs.
