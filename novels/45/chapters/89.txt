Chapter 90: Let Me Feed Her The Medicine

Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

Seeing that Qiao Nian looked alright, Zhao Qian looked toward Jiang Yue, who was about to feed Matriarch Gu some medicine. She frowned.

Holding the bowl of medicine, Jiang Yue walked to the bed and began to feed Matriarch Gu the medicine.

But Matriarch Gu was still unconscious. She simply could not swallow the medicine.

Jiang Yue was so anxious that her eyes had turned red. She said tearfully, “What should we do? Grandma can’t drink the medicine at all. If this drags on until Grandma’s asthma flares up, that will be catastrophic.”

Everyone in the room turned to look at Matriarch Gu worriedly.

Qiao Nian walked over and said, “Let me feed her the medicine!”

Jiang Yue glanced at Qiao Nian hesitantly, evidently still dissatisfied with her.

Zhao Qian was so anxious that she had begun to pace about. She said worriedly, “Sister Jiang, you should give the medicine to Second Sister-in-law!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Only then did Jiang Yue hand the medicine to Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian took the bowl of medicine from Jiang Yue and sat down by Matriarch Gu’s bed. She helped Matriarch Gu up and placed a clean and damp piece of tissue into the bowl of medicine. After taking it out, she placed it next to Matriarch Gu’s mouth.

As a witness, Jiang Yue said with disdain, “Qiao Nian, what are you doing? Do you want Grandma to eat paper?”

Doctor Su, who was standing to the side, hesitated for a moment. “This is the first time I’ve seen someone feed medicine like this!”

Hearing Doctor Su’s words, Jiang Yue grew even more confident. She glared at Qiao Nian angrily. “Qiao Nian, you’re simply fooling around!”

Qiao Nian couldn’t even be bothered to look at Jiang Yue. With an indifferent expression, she said, “If her lips are wet, she should be able to drink more.”

Upon hearing her words, Doctor Su nodded thoughtfully and agreed, “Second Young Madam, this method is excellent. I’ve learned from you.”

Through Qiao Nian’s solution, Matriarch Gu indeed drank quite a bit of medicine.

After that, Qiao Nian got Matriarch Gu to lie back down on the bed. She reached out to take Matriarch Gu’s pulse.

Jiang Yue grabbed Qiao Nian’s arm and said angrily, “Get up. Let Doctor Su treat Grandma.”

Qiao Nian looked toward Jiang Yue with a complicated expression. Just as she was about to speak, Matriarch Gu, who was still unconscious, spat out another mouthful of blood and collapsed onto the bed.

Qiao Nian’s expression changed.

“Qiao Nian, what on earth did you do to Grandma? Why is Grandma still vomiting blood?!” Jiang Yue roared. She clenched her fists and glared at Qiao Nian viciously, as if Qiao Nian was a heinous criminal.

Without hesitation, Jiang Yue pulled Qiao Nian aside.

At this moment, Gu Zhou walked in.

Gu Zhou had already seen Matriarch Gu vomiting blood. His face grew paler and paler, and his whole body emitted a cold aura. The entire room seemed to have entered the dead of winter.

Gu Zhou walked over to Doctor Su and asked, “How is Grandma now?”

Doctor Su was startled by Gu Zhou’s expression. He drew in a sharp breath, then quickly walked over to Matriarch Gu with his head lowered and began to take her pulse.

Doctor Su had initially thought that Matriarch Gu was only suffering from a fever and a cold, and that there was nothing seriously wrong with her. However, when he took her pulse, he was shocked.

Qiao Nian saw that Doctor Su’s expression had changed. Her eyelid was twitching more and more, and the ominous feeling in her heart grew stronger and stronger.

Qiao Nian looked at Doctor Su coldly and asked in a low voice, “What’s Grandma’s condition now?”

The cold aura Qiao Nian was exuding was no weaker than Gu Zhou’s. Her beautiful eyes were slightly narrowed, and Doctor Su found that he didn’t dare to look her in the eye.

Doctor Su stood at the side, trembling. He said shakily, “Matriarch… Matriarch Gu’s pulse is very strange.”

“How is it strange?” Zhao Qian asked impatiently. She took out a tissue and wiped her tears.

Jiang Yue turned to look at Qiao Nian with resentment written all over her face. “You must have harmed Grandma on purpose.”

Gu Zhou glared sharply at Jiang Yue, frightening her into silence.
