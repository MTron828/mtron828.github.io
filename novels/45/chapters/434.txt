Chapter 435: No Need to Restrain

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Gu Zhou was usually a thoughtful person. Ordinary people could not tell what he was thinking, but Gu Zhou’s second personality was very innocent. He would subconsciously forget all the bad things.

Although Qiao Nian knew that Zhou Zhou might not know what had happened to Gu Zhou, she couldn’t help but ask, “How did you get those injuries?”

Gu Zhou said honestly, “I don’t know.”

Only then did Qiao Nian give up. It seemed that he didn’t know anything.

Qiao Nian only wanted Gu Zhou to rest well. She said gently, “Gu Zhou, I’ll help you sit up. You need to dry your hair. Don’t catch a cold again.”

Gu Zhou frowned slightly, and a trace of confusion flashed across his eyes. He asked, “Nian Nian, who is Gu Zhou?”

Qiao Nian was speechless.

Seeing Qiao Nian like this, Gu Zhou asked unhappily, “Nian Nian, do you have other children?”

What a kid…

Only then did Qiao Nian realize that Gu Zhou’s split personality seemed to yearn for love and care.

Could it be that Gu Zhou had been bullied when he was young?

Zhou Zhou was obedient and looked very insecure.

Gu Zhou’s clear eyes were fixed on Qiao Nian. Seeing that she was silent, his eyes gradually darkened. He said in a low voice, “Nian Nian, are you unwilling to take care of Zhou Zhou because you have Gu Zhou?”

......

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou’s serious expression and didn’t know what to say.

He was clearly Gu Zhou!

Gu Zhou didn’t get a reply from Qiao Nian. He lowered his head and frowned aggrievedly, enduring the pain in his back.

Qiao Nian explained gently, “Zhou Zhou. Your nickname is Zhouz Zhou, and your name is Gu Zhou!”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian say this, he was very resistant. “My name isn’t Gu Zhou!”

Qiao Nian was slightly taken aback.

Only then did she realize that she couldn’t let Zhou Zhou know about Gu Zhou. If that happened, it was very likely that the Zhou Zhou would squeeze out the first personality.

If this continued, Gu Zhou would really become a Zhou Zhou.

After some thought, Qiao Nian could only lie. She smiled and said, “I was the one who gave you the name Gu Zhou. If you don’t like it, I’ll always call you Zhou Zhou.

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, he instantly cheered up. “Yes, Nian Nian. My name is Zhou Zhou!”

He revealed an innocent and cute smile. This was an expression that Gu Zhou would never show.

She felt dazed.

“Nian Nian.”

Qiao Nian came back to her senses and smiled. “I’ll help you dry your hair first. It’s not good to sleep with wet hair.”

“Okay.”

Qiao Nian helped Gu Zhou sit up. Seeing that his face was scrunched up in pain, she suddenly remembered something Gu Zhou had said to her in the past.

She no longer had to restrain herself.

Qiao Nian smiled at Gu Zhou and said gently, “Zhou Zhou, you’re yourself. You’re unique in this world. If it hurts, you can tell me. You don’t have to restrain yourself when you’re with me.”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s gentle voice, Zhou Zhou’s heart warmed.

If only his mother had said the same thing to him before.

Then he wasn’t his brother’s vessel. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

At this thought, his eyes widened involuntarily, and a bunch of questions appeared in his mind.

What’s a vessel?

Brother?

Mum?

Since when did he have a family?

As he thought about it, his head hurt. Some strange fragments flashed through his mind, but he couldn’t remember anything.

Seeing that Gu Zhou’s expression wasn’t right, Qiao Nian looked at him worriedly.

“Zhou Zhou.”

After a long time, Gu Zhou returned to normal. He looked at Qiao Nian innocently. “Nian Nian, is there really no need to restrain myself?”

“Of course.”

It was fine as long as Gu Zhou did not lose control.

If Gu Zhou did not restrain himself, she would not have a good life.

Gu Zhou was a little difficult to deal with!
