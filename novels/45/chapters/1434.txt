1435 Zhou Zhou

Gu Zhou hugged Qiao Nian gently. If only he could be with Nian’er forever. If only there weren’t those messy events. Then the two of them would definitely live a warm and comfortable life in the Gu family villa.

He hoped that during this trip to Europe, they would be able to find the person who had kidnapped Nian’er more than twenty years ago and deal with the people who wanted to mess with the Lu and Gu families!

Gu Zhou’s eyes gradually hardened. Suddenly, a strange scene appeared in his mind. He frowned and couldn’t help but hug Qiao Nian tightly.

“Nian’er?”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s voice, she looked up slightly and asked softly, “What’s wrong?”

Gu Zhou looked down at Qiao Nian with worry in his eyes. He pursed his lips slightly and said uncomfortably, “I remembered something just now.”

Qiao Nian asked curiously, “What is it?” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“I think you helped me take a shower when I was sitting in the bathtub.” After Gu Zhou finished speaking, he couldn’t help but laugh. “But I think it happened when I was very young. Now that I think about it, it must have happened in my dream.”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in front of her, slightly stunned. Just as she was about to ignore him, she heard Gu Zhou speak again.

“You seem to have fed me candy!”

Qiao Nian was speechless.

Qiao Nian’s body stiffened. Could it be that he had already recalled Zhou Zhou’s memories?

Should she fool him, or should she tell Gu Zhou and Zhou Zhou about their existence?

“But there’s something I don’t understand. When I was very young, why did I see you as an adult? Could it be that there’s really a matter of transmigrating time and space?” Gu Zhou asked solemnly.

For a moment, Qiao Nian didn’t know how to answer.

At this moment, Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian with a burning gaze and continued, “There’s another possibility. Could it be that what I just remembered is the memory of my third personality?”

Since Gu Zhou had already guessed it, Qiao Nian didn’t intend to hide it anymore. She smiled and said, “Yes.”

“What’s my third personality like?” Gu Zhou asked curiously.

Qiao Nian reached out and wrapped her arm around Gu Zhou’s waist. Smiling, she said, “Your third personality is called Zhou Zhou. Later on, he didn’t appear much either. At that time, I asked Qin Chuan, and he said that it was because of the feelings that your Zhou Zhou personality lacked. You slowly found them in real life, and Zhou Zhou’s personality gradually disappeared. However, when you think about it, you’ll still think that it happened at a young age.”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he couldn’t help but hug her tightly.

Qin Chuan was right. He had already found his true love in real life. He already had spiritual sustenance, and he was no longer short of love.

However, what made Gu Zhou uncomfortable was that Zhou Zhou should have appeared when he first met Qiao Nian, because he had just remembered that he seemed to be celebrating Qiao Nian’s birthday.

When he and Qiao Nian first married, he had once celebrated Qiao Nian’s birthday. At that time, his relationship with Qiao Nian wasn’t as good as it was now.

At that time, he suspected that Qiao Nian had been sent by someone else. He was still a little wary of her.

Even so, Qiao Nian was very gentle with his third personality. At the thought of this, Gu Zhou said guiltily, “Nian’er, thank you.”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion. “Why do you say that?”

“When my third personality appeared, it should have been when we first met. At that time, I didn’t treat you well, and you even took good care of me.”

When Qiao Nian realized what Gu Zhou was saying, she smiled and said, “Actually, I think you’re quite good. You’re just unforgiving with your words. You didn’t do anything bad to me. It’s normal for you to be wary of me.”

What Qiao Nian had just said was just to fool Gu Zhou.

In fact, no one could reject an obedient and adorable Zhou Zhou. The contrast was too adorable.

However, she would never see Zhou Zhou again.

To be honest, she still liked Zhou Zhou’s obedient voice.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian with a burning gaze. His obsidian-like eyes sparkled under the moonlight, and clouds surged in them, as if he was holding back something.
