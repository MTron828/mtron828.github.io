Matriarch Gu had always felt that Qiao Nian was very outstanding. Such an outstanding child would naturally attract the attention of other outstanding youths.

Zhao Qian couldn’t compare to Qiao Nian. Coupled with the fact that Qiao Nian had reached Li Kun first, there was nothing one could do about Li Kun taking a liking to Qiao Nian.

“Grandma, let’s go down for dinner!” Zhao Qian smiled at Matriarch Gu. However, she was puzzled. Wasn’t Matriarch Gu curious as to why Qiao Nian was meeting other men?

“Alright, let’s go down for dinner!” Matriarch Gu was a little worried that Zhao Qian would be displeased with Qiao Nian over this matter. She consoled her, saying, “Don’t take this to heart. Nian Nian didn’t do it on purpose. This just means that you and Li Kun weren’t meant to be.”

A trace of surprise flashed in Zhao Qian’s eyes.

Qiao Nian had just married into the Qiao family not long ago, yet Grandma was already favoring her to such an extent.

Qiao Nian had stolen her blind date from her. Not only did Grandma not blame Qiao Nian, but she also consoled Zhao Qian not to be unhappy with Qiao Nian over this matter.

The shadow in Zhao Qian’s eyes dissipated in an instant. Smiling, she looked up at Matriarch Gu and said sweetly, “Grandma, Second Sister-in-law didn’t do it on purpose. She was meeting up with someone else in the cafe, but she mistook Li Kun for him.”

The smile on Matriarch Gu’s face gradually faded. She frowned slightly and asked in confusion, “Why did she ask someone out?”

“I-I think it’s a blind date…” Zhao Qian lowered her head. Her entire manner was one of embarrassment, as if it were difficult to speak.

Blind date?

Matriarch Gu frowned slightly. Puzzled, she looked at Zhao Qian and asked, “Why didn’t you say so earlier?”

“I-I didn’t know how to say it,” Zhao Qian said hesitantly. She didn’t understand why Matriarch Gu was questioning her now. She felt that Matriarch Gu should be questioning Qiao Nian instead.

“Did you drop a hint that she was on a blind date on purpose?” Matriarch Gu asked, enunciating every word.

Zhao Qian looked at Matriarch Gu with fear and unease written all over her face. She reached out and grasped Matriarch Gu’s hand. Frowning, she explained with utter sincerity, “Grandma, Second Sister-in-law was on a blind date. I should have told you everything, but I was afraid that there would be a

misunderstanding, Perhaps that person was Second Sister-in-law’s patient. I can’t say something so improbable!”

Zhao Qian explained seriously, her face flushed red with worry.

Matriarch Gu looked at the state Zhao Qian was in and gently patted her hand. She consoled her softly, “Good child, I know what you mean. You’re still too young. You have to learn to trust your Second Sister-in-law.”

A trace of coldness flashed in Zhao Qian’s heart, but she put on a meek facade as if she had been taught a lesson. She nodded and said, “Grandma, I understand. I will always trust my Second Sister-in-law!”

Matriarch Gu nodded in satisfaction.

The grandmother and granddaughter pair were about to head downstairs when Zhao Qian glanced at the document on the table by accident. The document had the words “Last Will and Testament” written on it in red.

However, the names of who would inherit, as well as details regarding the division of the inheritance, were not yet written on the document.

“Grandma!” Zhao Qian’s eyes instantly tumed red. Looking at Matriarch Gu with teary eyes, she sobbed as she asked, “Grandma, you will live a long life. Why did you write this? You…”

Towards the end, Zhao Qian was already sobbing uncontrollably.

Matriarch Gu looked at Zhao Qian’s heartbroken expression. Previously, she had been worried that Zhao Qian would deliberately sow discord in front of her. Now she knew that the child was wholeheartedly committed to the Gu family.

“I just wanted to settle my affairs in advance.” Matriarch Gu took out a tissue to help Zhao Qian wipe her face. “Good child, don’t cry.”

“Grandma, you can clearly live to a hundred or beyond. Qian Qian just wants to stay by your side.” The more Zhao Qian spoke, the more upset she felt. Tears began to stream down her face.

“All humans will have to plan their future ahead of time.” Matriarch Gu placed the will into the cabinet and locked it up. She did not want Zhao Qian to feel upset upon seeing it. “This is a good thing.”

At this moment, there was a knock on the door.
