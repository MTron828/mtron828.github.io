922 Three Children

“Back then, Mom thought that when you gave birth, you could just raise these three children outside. If you want to see them, you can visit them. Usually, you can get the nanny to help take care of them and get them a pair of parents to let them grow up safely! Mom has never thought of dealing with you and your children!”

When Qiao Nian heard Qiao Xin’s words, she was slightly stunned. She asked, “Three children?”

“Qiao Nian, is there something wrong with your brain? Back then, you did give birth to three children. At that time, the people from the mental hospital called us. When Mom and I rushed over, you had already come out of the operating theater. The doctor told me that none of your three children survived!”

Qiao Nian felt her breathing quicken. What exactly had happened back then?

Why didn’t she have any impression of it?

She actually gave birth to three children.

At first, she only remembered that she had a child. Only later did she remember that she had given birth to twins.

But Qiao Xin actually said that she had given birth to three children. Qiao Xin didn’t look like she was lying.

Qiao Nian’s frown deepened. Her mother had also given birth to triplets, so it was very likely that she would give birth to triplets.

Qiao Xin looked at Qiao Nian’s stunned expression. This was the first time she had seen Qiao Nian in such a daze. Only then did she realize that Qiao Nian really didn’t remember what had happened the night she gave birth.

“Didn’t the doctor tell you how many children you gave birth to?” Qiao Xin asked with a frown. “Besides, you’re a medical student. Don’t you usually take your pulse and check your health? I heard that when a Chinese medicine practitioner takes your pulse, we can find out how many children there are.”

“Speaking of which, Chinese medicine is quite magical. If you had a child in your stomach, you should have two pulses. If there were two children, there should be three pulses. At that time, you were pregnant with three children, so there should be four pulses.”

At that time, she couldn’t wait for Qiao Nian to die. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

However, according to her mother, Qiao Nian was good-looking. In the future, she would let Qiao Nian marry someone powerful into the Qiao family to consolidate the Qiao family’s strength.

At that time, Qiao Xin was still thinking that it was a good thing that the three children were all dead. Otherwise, Qiao Nian might not have been willing to marry because of them.

On the other hand, if Qiao Nian lost three children at once, she would definitely be devastated. She would be crippled.

She had never expected Qiao Nian to have forgotten about this.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips tightly. Her breathing grew heavier and heavier, and her face turned pale. She tried hard to recall what had happened that night.

Moreover, Qiao Xin’s words made her realize something.

When she was pregnant, she should have taken her pulse. She should have known that she was pregnant with a few children.

But she had no such memories at all.

Qiao Nian’s frown deepened. What exactly was the problem?

When she woke up after giving birth, she knew that her child had not survived. For a moment, she could not stand the pain of losing her son. Later on, Qin Chuan used hypnosis to make her forget about her pregnancy. The only thing she remembered was that she had once given birth.

If she was pregnant, she would definitely take very careful care of her body and the child in her stomach. How could she give birth to a dead baby?

She actually gave birth to three children.

Where was the last child?

Was that child still alive?

Qiao Xin thought that she had hit the nail on the head. Thinking about it, it made sense. Qiao Nian’s medical skills were so good, but she couldn’t save her three children. She said sarcastically, “It’s really tragic to be your children. You’re such an outstanding doctor, but you can’t save them. What a pity. They never had time to see this world before they had to leave!”

Qiao Nian’s body was trembling, and her breathing had become difficult.

She could vaguely remember her sitting on the hospital bed, crying and hugging a dead baby. Gu Qi and Xiao Shi’s faces suddenly appeared in her mind.

If it weren’t for Xiao Shi’s appearance and Song Man’s schemes, she might never have realized that her children were still alive!

Could the other child really be dead?

Or had someone exchanged the dead baby in her arms for her children?
