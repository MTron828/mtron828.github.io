Chapter 358: Intentional

Jiang Yue and Qin Lu instantly understood. So Li Kun wanted to buy this Night-Luminescent Pearl for Qiao Nian.

Jiang Yue clenched her fists involuntarily.

Qin Lu, who was standing at the side, was on the verge of tears. That was 51 million yuan for a night pearl! Just because Qiao Nian liked it?

Qin Lu couldn’t understand Li Kun’s thoughts.

“Fifty-five million.”

Just as everyone was sighing, another male voice sounded.

Everyone looked over and saw that the bidder was Gu Zhou.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion. She didn’t know when Gu Zhou had started liking such things.

Zhang Lei, who was standing on stage, was extremely excited. He hurriedly said, “55 million going once, 55 million going twice, 55 million…”

“Sixty million!” Li Kun interrupted Zhang Lei. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Zhang Lei’s eyes instantly lit up. He took a deep breath and said excitedly, “The Night-Luminescent Pearls of the ancient city of Lou Lan has already…”

“70 million.” Gu Zhou bid without batting an eyelid.

Li Kun’s frown deepened.

Seeing that Li Kun still wanted to bid, Qin Dong hurriedly tugged at Li Kun’s sleeve and said softly, “No one can stop Gu Zhou from getting what he wants. I think that girl might not like this Night-Luminescent Pearl either. Let’s look at the others!”

At this moment, a rich man saw the two young masters continuously bidding for a night pearl. He stared unblinkingly at the night pearl.

Could this night pearl be so valuable?

Since it was something valuable, he definitely couldn’t let it go.

“71 million!” The tycoon continued to bid.

Everyone’s gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face.

Qiao Nian naturally didn’t know what Gu Zhou was thinking. She said in a low voice, “There must be better items later!”

What Qiao Nian meant was that there was no need to waste money on this night pearl!

Gu Zhou’s eyes darkened, but he quickly regained his composure.

Zhang Lei, who was standing on the stage, held a small hammer and shouted excitedly, “71 million going once, 71 million going twice, 71 million going thrice. Deal!”

With a clang, the ownership of the Night-Luminescent Pearl was decided.

Everyone hurriedly applauded.

The rich man was overjoyed to be able to obtain the night pearl Gu Zhou wanted.

Everyone knew in their hearts that Gu Zhou simply didn’t want the eldest young master of the Li family to obtain the Night-Luminescent Pearl.

Jiang Yue didn’t feel well anymore. Her breathing was a little irregular.

Song Yu glanced at Qiao Nian thoughtfully. She was closer to Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian, so she had heard everything Qiao Nian had said.

She didn’t expect Gu Zhou to listen to Qiao Nian.

Zhang Lei’s words on the stage quickly interrupted Song Yu’s thoughts. “The next item is called the Stone Wall Painting. I’m sure everyone has heard of it!”

“Oh my god, it’s actually the Stone Wall Painting!”

“I heard that many collectors want to collect this painting, but they’ve never found the real one!”

“Not many of Mr. Huang Shi’s works have been passed down. This painting must be priceless!”

“I believe Mr. Qin Chuan has put in a lot of effort to prepare for this auction!”

…

Gu Zhou’s eyes flickered. He had been searching for this painting for many years.

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. Previously, she had told Qin Chuan that this painting would be arranged at the end. Why was it brought forward?

Just as Qiao Nian was feeling puzzled, Zhang Lei introduced again. “This stone wall painting is from Miss Song Yu’s private collection. I heard that many people have put in a lot of effort into finding this painting, but unfortunately, none of them managed to obtain it in the end. Today, in order to build a school for the children in the poor district, Miss Song has taken out her favorite stone wall painting for charity. She truly has a beautiful heart!”

At this point, Zhang Lei was so excited that he was about to cry.
