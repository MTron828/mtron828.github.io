1539 Sad

Seeing that Shen Mei was motionless, Qiao Nian was about to speak when she saw the book in Shen Mei’s hand fall and smash into her leg. However, Shen Mei didn’t seem to feel anything at all.

Her voice was very soft. Like a feather, it landed lightly on the water without a ripple.

Shen Mei came back to her senses. The stunned expression on her face disappeared, and her eyes were filled with panic. Her lips trembled slightly, and her entire body trembled violently.

“No, that’s not right.” Shen Mei covered her ears with both hands and hid in a corner, trembling. Her voice trembled as she said, “An City, An City. I don’t know. I don’t know anything…”

Shen Mei spouted some words. They were scattered and could not be pieced together into a whole sentence.

However, judging from Shen Mei’s condition, Qiao Nian was already certain that Shen Mei was Professor Shen An’s daughter. If Shen Mei had nothing to do with Shen An, then Shen Mei wouldn’t have been stunned when she heard Shen An’s name.

However, Shen Mei seemed to be very afraid of hearing the word “An City”. This was a strange thing.

Qiao Nian moved slightly closer to Shen Mei and gently comforted her. She said gently, “Madam, Madam, don’t be afraid. You’re very safe now. This is the palace, where the president and you live.”

Shen Mei’s body was still trembling. She looked up at Qiao Nian.

Seeing that Shen Mei was listening to her, Qiao Nian continued, “Madam, don’t be anxious. I think you might have forgotten some important memories, but don’t be anxious. You’ll definitely remember them in the future. You should recuperate well now. Let’s drink the medicine first, okay?”

With that, Qiao Nian handed the potion to Shen Mei from the bedside table.

The medicinal fragrance wafted to the tip of Shen Mei’s nose. Smelling the fragrance, she felt a little better. Her gaze fell on the medicinal soup. She took it from Qiao Nian.

Shen Mei’s hands trembled slightly, as did the bowl in her hand, as if the medicine would spill in the next moment.

Shen Mei looked at the bowl in her hand. She had been drinking this medicine for the past two days. She had drunk all kinds of medicine in the past. This medicine was also her favorite.

It was sweet and without any bitterness.

But now, she didn’t want to take her medicine at all.

Qiao Nian reached out to help Shen Mei drag the bowl of medicine, not letting it spill.

At this moment, Shen Mei’s face was covered in tears, and her chest was heaving violently. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry…”

Shen Mei exuded a strong sense of sorrow. She could clearly feel the pain in Shen Mei’s heart. She placed the medicine on the bedside table again, took a tissue from the side, and carefully wiped the tears off Shen Mei’s face.

She reached out and hugged Shen Mei, gently patting her back to comfort her. “Alright, stop crying. If you can’t remember, let’s not think about it. When you recover, no matter what you think, you’ll be able to remember. Don’t think about it now, okay?”

Qiao Nian let go of Shen Mei and wiped her face again with a tissue. Shen Mei was about the same age as Qiao Nian’s mother, but Shen Mei’s mental age was like that of an innocent child. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Seeing that Shen Mei had finally stopped crying, she heaved a sigh of relief and felt a trace of guilt.

It seemed that Shen Mei couldn’t remember the past.

When Shen Mei had completely calmed down, Qiao Nian smiled at her and said, “Madam, drink some medicine. After you drink it, you’ll feel very comfortable. When the time comes, sleep. I’ll go pick herbs for you.”

Qiao Nian brought the medicine back to Shen Mei and said seriously, “You’ll recover completely after taking the medicine.”

Shen Mei nodded. She took the medicine from Qiao Nian with both hands and downed it in one gulp.

Her clear eyes were fixed on Qiao Nian, a smile on her face. “Thank you.”

“It’s my duty.” Qiao Nian smiled and took the bowl away. She helped Shen Mei lie down and covered her with the blanket.

Qiao Nian waited for Shen Mei to close her eyes before getting up to leave.
