985 Fourth Brother

Lu Qi ran to the driver’s door and pointed into the window. Her face was a little red with excitement as she said, “Brother, look. She’s our older sister. She’s really our older sister!”

Qiao Nian had thought that it would be fine as long as she acknowledged Fourth Brother over the phone. She didn’t expect to see him now.

She felt a little uncomfortable. She looked up at Lu Jiang and their eyes met.

Lu Jiang stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian, his phoenix-like eyes narrowing slightly.

Outside the car window, it instantly fell silent. No one moved.

At this moment, Lu Jiang reached out and opened the driver’s door.

Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat. Her breathing involuntarily lightened as she stared unblinkingly at Lu Jiang.

Qiao Nian had heard from her eldest brother that Third Brother, Fourth Brother, and her were triplets. They were even closer.

She had met Fourth Brother once and was not familiar with him.

Back then, when she reunited with her brother, she had experienced life and death with him in MY.

She had acknowledged Second Brother. Second Brother was her idol, and she and Second Brother had a tacit understanding in music.

It had been very easy for her to interact with Third Brother. Third Brother had been protecting her and doting on her like a little princess.

She didn’t know what kind of personality Fourth Brother had, nor did she know how to get close to him.

That day at the bar, she was about to return the clothes to Fourth Brother, but he rejected her!

The car door opened and Lu Jiang spoke. “Eldest Miss.”

His voice was a little low, but very gentle, with a hint of joy.

A trace of shyness flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes. This form of address was simply too awesome!

Eldest Miss seemed to have raised her status.

Qiao Nian smiled. She was the eldest daughter of the Lu family and his sister.

Qiao Nian got out of the car and stood in front of Lu Jiang openly. She looked up and called out, “Fourth Brother!”

Lu Jiang nodded and smiled.

Qiao Nian was stunned. Lu Jiang had two shallow dimples on his cheeks. When he smiled, he looked very sexy, but he didn’t look out of place at all.

This smile was simply more dazzling than the sun.

Especially Fourth Brother’s phoenix-like eyes. When he smiled, his eyes seemed to contain a sea of stars!

When Third Brother smiled, he looked roguish and charming, making one laugh uncontrollably.

However, Fourth Brother was completely different. He was like an elegant gentleman. When he smiled, he gave off a bright and clean feeling.

Lu Jiang raised his eyebrows slightly and said in an elegant voice, “Where’s my jacket?”

Qiao Nian blinked her fox-like eyes in confusion, then muttered, “Fourth Brother, how can you be so petty… Didn’t you say that you didn’t want it last time? Now, you’re asking me for it?”

Who would go back on their word?

Lu Jiang shook his head disapprovingly. His thin lips curved up slightly as he said, “Sister has worn it before. It’s different.”

Puzzled, Qiao Nian asked, “What difference can there be?”

“I want to treasure it!”

His voice was as gentle as jade, giving off a peaceful feeling. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

When Qiao Nian came back to her senses, she laughed out loud and nodded. “Alright, I’ll return the suit jacket to you later.”

Lu Jiang nodded in agreement.

Lu Qi’s big eyes flickered in confusion. She looked at Fourth Brother’s face, then moved her gaze to her sister’s face. After some serious thought, she asked, “Fourth Brother and Sister, you know each other!”

With that, Lu Qi pouted unhappily. She looked up at Lu Jiang and said, “Fourth Brother, you’ve gone too far. Since you knew Sister long ago, why didn’t you tell me earlier?”

Lu Jiang looked down at Lu Qi and said gently, “We just met once. Didn’t I tell you about that night at the bar?”

A bar?

Lu Qi came to a realization and gasped. “Fourth Brother, could it be that you saved Sister back then?”

Lu Jiang nodded.

Lu Qi couldn’t help but sigh. “This is really fate. I didn’t expect Fourth Brother to save Sister! Sister saved me now! Then, we reunited!”

Lu Jiang retracted his gaze from Lu Qi’s face and his gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. His eyes lit up, and his heart softened.

He had never expected his sister, who he had always thought was dead, to stand in front of him alive.
