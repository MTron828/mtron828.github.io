Chapter 669: Evidence

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

When Lu Zhu heard Lu Nian’s words, he lowered his gaze slightly.

When his mother had adopted Song Yu, he wanted to object. However, his mother’s mental state was not good, so he had not said anything.

No matter how good Song Yu was, she was not their biological sister.

Lu Zhu also knew that no matter how clearly he said it, Lu Nian would still be very confused.

No one would believe that a person who had been dead for more than twenty years would stand in front of them alive.

When he found out that Qiao Nian was Sugar, he was also very shocked. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

If he hadn’t seen the DNA report, he wouldn’t have believed that Sugar was still alive.

Lu Zhu sighed slightly and said seriously, “I’ve made it very clear. Qiao Nian isn’t my adopted sister. She’s our biological sister to begin with. Lu Nian, take a closer look at Qiao Nian. Does she look a little like Mother and Lu Qi? She’s Sugar, the biological sister we thought had died more than twenty years ago. She’s the eldest daughter of the Lu family.”

What?

Lu Nian felt as if he had been struck by lightning. He was instantly charred on the outside and tender on the inside.

Inch by inch, he turned his head to look at Qiao Nian in disbelief.

Qiao Nian’s beautiful fox-like eyes were simply carved from the same mold as his mother’s.

Lu Nian’s lips moved slightly, but he couldn’t make a sound.

How was this possible?

Qiao Nian looked at Lu Nian expectantly. Although she looked calm on the surface, her heart was in a mess.

At this moment, she was a little grateful to Su Sheng. If Su Sheng hadn’t said those things, it might be a while before she could reunite with Second Brother.

Qiao Nian knew in her heart that this news was too shocking. It was normal for Second Brother not to believe her. She had initially wanted Big Brother to get Second Brother’s hair and then do a DNA test on her and Second Brother.

If she took the report to Second Brother, he would probably believe that she was Sugar.

Lu Nian’s heart was beating faster and faster. He felt that the entire world had quietened down. The only thing he could hear was his own heartbeat.

His eyes were a little hot, and his throat was a little dry. He stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian, especially her eyes.

When he first saw Qiao Nian, he was attracted by her eyes.

When Qiao Nian smiled, her fox-like eyes curved up slightly. She looked very beautiful.

Previously, he had always thought that he liked fox eyes.

But now that he thought about it, he didn’t like fox-like eyes, but Qiao Nian’s eyes, which were very similar to his mother’s.

Oh my god! Sugar was still alive.

Back then, when they received a part of Sugar’s body, their mother had personally done a DNA test on Sugar and confirmed that the corpse was Sugar.

Just because of this, everyone in the Lu family felt that Sugar was really dead.

Lu Nian sniffled, his voice a little hoarse. He turned to look at Lu Zhu and asked carefully, “Brother, are you lying to me on purpose to woo Sister Nian?”

Lu Zhu’s entire face darkened. Suppressing the discomfort in his heart, he said patiently, “Do you think I’ll joke about my bloodline?”

“Back then, we saw a large piece of flesh on Sugar’s body, but she’s intact now…” Lu Nian frowned. He felt that even if Sugar was still alive, she should be disabled, not like Qiao Nian who had all four limbs.

No, how could he curse his sister to be disabled?

He sincerely hoped that Qiao Nian was his sister, Sugar, but he couldn’t make random claims about her bloodline!

Lu Zhu knew that Lu Nian wouldn’t believe that Sugar was still alive. He took out his phone and found the photo of his DNA report with Qiao Nian.

Lu Zhu said calmly, “Back in MY, Sugar and I had already done a DNA test. This report proves that she’s Sugar!”

Qiao Nian stood at the side and nodded. She said softly, “I originally wanted to do a DNA test with Second Brother and Third Brother. That way, when we reunite, you won’t be suspicious anymore.”
