Chapter 609: Punishment

Punishment?

Qiao Nian had the feeling that she was still a child who would be punished by the adults for doing something wrong.

Qiao Nian still didn’t understand what the man meant.

Could it be that she had met Gu Chuan before she married Gu Zhou?

In other words, Gu Chuan’s personality had existed for a long time.

“You’re on my bed, but still thinking about other things. I should have tied you to the bed so that you wouldn’t be able to run away for the rest of your life.”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Chuan’s words, she sensed his body pressing down on hers. She hurriedly reached out to resist. She didn’t want to be suffocated by Gu Chuan again.

However, Gu Chuan was very strong. She could not resist him at all.

Just as she was about to speak, she saw Gu Chuan’s hurt expression. She frowned slightly.

Those who didn’t know better would think that she was a heartless person. She wasn’t even responsible for dumping him.

Qiao Nian imagined the scene of Gu Chuan being dumped and hurriedly said, “Gu Chuan, why don’t you think about it carefully? Did you get the wrong person?”Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Gu Chuan’s expression instantly darkened. His eyes, which were filled with stars, instantly turned as dark as ink, making one feel suffocated.

Gu Chuan continued, “Even if you turn to dust, I’ll still be able to recognize you. I’ll piece you back together bit by bit. Nian’er, don’t even think about escaping!”

“No, you might really be mistaken…”

“Nian’er, I’m the one who gave you your life.” The man interrupted Qiao Nian impatiently.

Your life was given to you by me!

Qiao Nian’s heart began to race uncontrollably. She looked up at Gu Chuan. The places he had touched were burning hot. Her voice seemed to have disappeared as well.

After a long while, Qiao Nian finally spoke. “W-what do you mean?”

Could it be that he thought he was her father?

How was this possible?

If they were really father and daughter, Gu Chuan would never do such an ambiguous thing.

Seeing Qiao Nian’s serious expression, the man narrowed his eyes in displeasure. “You still haven’t remembered, huh?”

He stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian. Qiao Nian felt a little suffocated under his gaze. All she wanted to do was escape.

She really couldn’t remember anything.

Had she really forgotten something?

Suddenly.

She vaguely felt that she had forgotten something important, but she couldn’t remember anything.

She really couldn’t remember having any interactions with him. Moreover, she was very concerned about what Gu Chuan had said about giving her a life.

Why couldn’t she remember such a big thing?

Gu Chuan looked into Qiao Nian’s eyes, his gaze filled with disappointment. All the sorrow in his heart surged out in an instant. He held Qiao Nian’s chin tightly with his right hand and asked in a low voice, “Nian’er, how could you forget that matter?”

Qiao Nian met Gu Chuan’s eyes. She was confused by the pain and infatuation in his eyes. For some reason, she was surrounded by sadness. Her voice was a little soft. “Gu Chuan…”

Gu Chuan silenced her with his mouth.

Qiao Nian’s body instantly tensed up. Gu Chuan’s pained expression flashed before her eyes, and her heart softened involuntarily. It seemed that she had to investigate Gu Chuan’s past.

As the stronger of the three personalities, Gu Chuan knew everything judging by his reaction today. Moreover, it was very likely that he had a childhood sweetheart who had grown up with him.

She was his childhood sweetheart’s substitute.

As Qiao Nian thought about it, she reached out to push Gu Chuan away. Unexpectedly, Gu Chuan bit her lip.

Pain streaked across her lips, followed by the faint smell of blood.

Was this man a dog?

He stubbornly wanted to find his childhood sweetheart, but he stubbornly refused to tell her what had happened. Now, he even bit her for no reason.

She suddenly recalled what he had said last time. If she didn’t listen to him, he would bite her.

Initially, she had thought that “bite” was a threat. Now, it seemed that it was just a casual movement.

Gradually, her mind became muddled from lack of oxygen. The tip of her nose was filled with the man’s pleasant scent.

Just as Qiao Nian was about to lose consciousness from suffocation, the man finally let go of her.

Panting heavily, Qiao Nian looked at the man in front of her.
