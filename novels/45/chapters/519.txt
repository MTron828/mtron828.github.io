Chapter 520: Nian’er

His voice was deep and magnetic, and his voice was extremely sexy. However, when he spoke, he sounded soft and aggrieved.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but feel her heart ache. Suddenly, she remembered what Chen Qing had told her previously.

The appearance of Gu Zhou’s second personality was very likely because of his grandmother.

If that was the case, then Gu Zhou must have suffered a lot when he was young. At that time, he was still so young. How did he survive that painful time?

The man couldn’t help but hold Qiao Nian in his arms even more tightly. After an unknown period of time, the clothes on his chest were already burning.

Qiao Nian opened her mouth slightly and comforted him softly. “Don’t worry, I won’t leave.”

Gu Zhou buried his head in Qiao Nian’s shoulder, his voice hazy and ethereal. “Zhou Zhou is afraid of the dark, but he’s also afraid that Nian Nian won’t want him!”

Qiao Nian wanted to turn around and hug Gu Zhou, but she didn’t know how strong he was. She could only let Gu Zhou hug her from behind.

“Alright, I’ll accompany you now!”

Gu Zhou let go of Qiao Nian’s hand slightly. He asked uneasily, “Nian Nian… will you always be with me?”

His voice was like clear wine. It was terribly pleasant.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but frown. Her marriage to Gu Zhou was just a joke. She couldn’t stay in the Gu family forever.

Moreover, the reason why she was willing to marry over was that she did not want anyone to disturb her work.

She and Gu Zhou would be separated one day.

Moreover, if Gu Zhou knew about her past, he probably wouldn’t accept her either. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

At this thought, Qiao Nian patted Gu Zhou’s hand gently and said, “Zhou Zhou, we all have our own lives now. We can’t be together forever. You’ll understand in the future.”

Gu Zhou’s body stiffened and he let go of her.

Qiao Nian turned to look at Gu Zhou and saw a hint of hurt on his face. He asked sadly, “Why can’t we be together forever?”

“I just want to be with Nian Nian all the time.”

“What should I do so that the two of us can be together forever and not be apart?”

“Zhou Zhou really doesn’t want to be separated from Nian Nian.”

Gu Zhou’s series of words made Qiao Nian panic.

This was the first time she had heard Gu Zhou’s second personality say so much. He seemed to be very afraid of losing her.

Tears filled his eyes, as if they were going to fall any second.

For a moment, Qiao Nian didn’t know how to answer Gu Zhou.

Just as Qiao Nian was feeling puzzled, Gu Zhou frowned. His eyes gradually darkened, and even his voice became dangerous. “You don’t want to be with me because of Gu Zhou?”

Qiao Nian was speechless.

Qiao Nian instantly felt suffocated. How should she tell him that he was Gu Zhou?

While Qiao Nian was in a daze, the man had already taken her words as tacit agreement.

The man’s phoenix eyes narrowed slightly, and his sexy Adam’s apple bobbed. He confirmed again, “Nian’er is unwilling to be with me because of Gu Zhou?”

Nian’er?

Why had his way of addressing her changed?

Qiao Nian’s heart trembled, and her ears turned red.

Qiao Yu used to call her that, but from Gu Zhou’s mouth, it sounded different.

His voice was pure lust and dangerous, and his eyes had turned cold.

Suddenly, Qiao Nian felt a sense of danger. She couldn’t help but swallow. She looked up at him and hurriedly comforted him, “How is that possible? Gu Zhou is actually a big baddie. How can I leave you just to be with him?”

Qiao Nian was a little flustered.

Gu Zhou’s condition was not good now. When his condition stabilized in the future, she would definitely record all of the conversations when his second personality appeared. At that time, she would show it to Gu Zhou and ask him for compensation for her mental damage.
