867 Mother Is the Most Important

Therefore, every day, she worked hard to reflect on herself and improve.

After waiting for so many years, when she grew up, she finally realized something.

Not every mother liked her child.

She was the child abandoned by her mother.

But even so, there was still a trace of hope in her heart. She hoped that Su Xue would accept her and bring her home.

Fantasy was still fantasy.

She knew that Su Xue would never bring her home. She would never like her.

She could understand Xiao Shi’s feelings for Song Man.

To every child, a mother was always the special one.

No matter what happened, a child would always miss her mother.

Xiao Shi had experienced a life and death situation, but the first thing she asked for when she woke up was still to look for Song Man.

Kinship was indeed the strongest bond in this world.

From the corner of his eye, Gu Zhou glanced at the dazed Song Man not far away. Song Man seemed to have fallen into some painful memory and sat on a stool in a daze.

Gu Zhou had not wanted to call Song Man over. In his opinion, Song Man must have given Xiao Shi the sleeping pills.

“Xiao Shi…”

Just as Gu Zhou was about to say something, Qiao Nian hurriedly interrupted him and said, “She’s right there.”

When Xiao Shi heard that Song Man was also here, her eyes lit up. Her eyes were red as she said with a sobbing voice, “I want Mommy!”

Gu Zhou looked at Xiao Shi’s stubborn and strong face. His expression gradually turned serious.

This time, he finally understood why Qiao Nian had said that Song Man was also here.

Although she was obedient and sensible, she was still a five-year-old child.

Just as Song Man had said previously, Song Man and Xiao Shi had relied on each other for more than five years. The two of them had a deep relationship. Even if he was Xiao Shi’s father, he could not replace Song Man in Xiao Shi’s heart. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Gu Zhou felt terrible and blamed himself.

However, he didn’t know what to do.

If he forcefully separated Song Man from her, it might hurt Xiao Shi like what Song Man said.

Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou looked at each other. Then, Qiao Nian stood up and walked towards Song Man.

She walked up to Song Man and looked down to see the panic in her eyes.

At this moment, Song Man seemed to be completely immersed in her own world and could not see anyone else.

“Xiao Shi is already awake!” Qiao Nian said calmly.

Only then did Song Man come back to her senses. She suddenly looked up at Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian spoke again. “She really wants to see you now!”

Song Man looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief. She hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to be willing to let her see Xiao Shi.

She glanced at Gu Zhou, who was walking over, and asked carefully, “Can I really see Xiao Shi?”

Gu Zhou did not even look at Song Man.

Seeing this, Qiao Nian said again, “Sure!”

At this moment, Song Man was ignored by Gu Zhou, but she was not angry. She hurriedly walked towards the bed.

At this moment, the nurse was pushing the hospital bed cart and preparing to enter the elevator, planning to send Xiao Shi to the ward.

Song Man hurriedly followed.

The elevator door slowly closed. When Qiao Nian could no longer see Song Man and Xiao Shi, she said to Gu Zhou, “Don’t worry, Xiao Shi should be out of danger. When her emotions stabilize, we’ll ask her why she took sleeping pills.”

Gu Zhou did not speak. He just felt helpless.

…

Song Man held Xiao Shi’s hand all the way until the nurse pushed the bed into the ward.

After the nurse left, Song Man stayed by Xiao Shi’s side. She looked at Xiao Shi’s pale face and said in a trembling voice, “Xiao Shi!”

When she saw Song Man, she had been holding back her tears. Her voice was soft and trembling. “Mommy, I don’t want to look for Grandpa and Grandma anymore, nor do I want to look for Daddy and Brother. Can we return to Nancheng now?”

When Song Man heard Xiao Shi’s words, she was stunned. She frowned slightly and asked, “Xiao Shi, don’t you like your father a lot? Why don’t you want him anymore?”
