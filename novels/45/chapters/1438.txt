1439 All-rounded

Previously, many famous doctors had treated Second Young Master. They all said that Second Young Master didn’t have much time left, but after Young Madam came, Second Young Master’s health improved by the day. From this, it could be seen how brilliant Young Madam’s medical skills were!

Lina’s gaze fell on Chen Qing’s face. Were all Asian men so good-looking?

Chen Qing was the same as Gu Zhou. His facial features were well-defined. Although they looked different, their temperaments were similar. Chen Qing’s skin was still her favorite wheat color.

Lina looked at Chen Qing and unknowingly fell into a daze.

Sensing Lina’s gaze, a trace of surprise flashed in Chen Qing’s eyes. He coughed slightly, as if reminding Lina to come back to her senses.

When Lina heard Chen Qing’s cough, she realized that she had lost her composure just now. She recalled Chen Qing’s praise of Qiao Nian’s medical skills and asked curiously, “Which aspect is Nian Nian mainly proficient in?”

When Chen Qing heard Lina’s question, he thought for a moment before saying, “Second Young Madam is an all rounder!”

Lina’s eyes lit up. She looked at Chen Qing in disbelief and asked seriously again, “Didn’t they say that doctors would only be proficient in certain aspects?”

“Second Young Madam is indeed an all rounder!” Chen Qing said firmly.

This was also the first time Chen Qing had seen an all-rounded doctor. Not only could Second Young Madam help Second Young Master detoxify his poison, but she also helped Second Young Master recuperate. Not only that, Second Young Master also had dissociative identity disorder. This illness was also treated by Second Young Madam!

When Lina heard Chen Qing’s words, her eyes flickered. If Nian Nian was an all rounder, did that mean that her mother’s illness could be saved?

What Lina hoped for the most now was for her mother to recover.

“Lina!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

At this moment, Qiao Nian’s voice came from the stairs, pulling Lina back from her thoughts.

Smiling, Lina placed the teacup in her hand on the coffee table. She stood up and waved at Qiao Nian. “Nian Nian!”

Qiao Nian was wearing gray sportswear today. Looking at Lina’s white sportswear, the two of them were actually wearing the same outfit, but the colors were different.

Just as Qiao Nian was about to go downstairs, she heard Chen Qing say that she was an all rounder. She didn’t expect her to be so amazing in Chen Qing’s eyes.

However, Lina was a little strange. She actually asked Chen Qing about her medical skills. Could it be that Lina’s family member was sick?

She was already very curious about who Lina’s mother was. She might even be able to take this opportunity to meet Lina’s mother. If Lina’s mother was really Teacher Shen’s lost daughter, it meant that the kidnapping more than twenty years ago was related to the president.

Qiao Nian had investigated before. It was very difficult for a person with cerebral palsy to give birth.

When Lina saw Qiao Nian, she smiled and walked over to her. She reached out and took Qiao Nian’s arm, smiling sweetly. “Nian Nian, our tastes are really similar. Our clothes are actually of the same color.”

Qiao Nian smiled and nodded. “I’ve always felt that the sportswear of this brand is more comfortable to wear!”

“I think so too!” Lina had a good impression of Qiao Nian to begin with. Now that she heard Qiao Nian’s words, her eyes were filled with smiles. “If their brand comes up with a new design, I’ll send you some items!”

“Okay!” Qiao Nian agreed readily. She was now completely certain that someone in Lina’s family was sick. Lina needed a doctor now.

“Come and eat with us. You’ll need more stamina to climb the mountain later!” Qiao Nian led Lina towards the cafeteria. Today, the kitchen was cooking a Chinese breakfast of porridge and deep-fried dough sticks and buns.

Lina looked at the food on the table and took a sip of porridge and a bite of the fried dough sticks. She couldn’t help but swallow. She no longer had the elegance of a princess.

“Nian Nian, is this your ordinary Chinese breakfast?” Lina asked in surprise.

“That’s right. We usually eat these for breakfast. Do you like them?” Qiao Nian looked at Lina and asked.

“Yes.” Lina took another sip of porridge and nodded solemnly. “Actually, I like your Oriental culture very much, and I like your food. However, the Chinese breakfast made by my chef is very strange. After eating your Chinese breakfast today, I want to change chefs!”
