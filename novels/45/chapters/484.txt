Chapter 485: Identification Results

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

After a DNA test, it was confirmed that Lu Zhu and Qiao Nian were related by blood. They were biological siblings!

Qiao Nian’s hands trembled involuntarily as she stared at the results in disbelief. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The result was more shocking than she had expected.

She never expected that she and Lu Zhu were biological siblings.

She originally thought that she was just the child of Lu Zhu’s family. If she was only the child of a mistress, she had no intention of going back.

Moreover, it was written very clearly on this DNA report that she and Lu Zhu had the same parents.

Why had it become like this?

If she was the biological daughter of the Lu family, why didn’t anyone look for her after she was away from home for so many years?

Qiao Nian staggered back a step, her eyes turning red.

The entire Lu family was reminiscing about their dead eldest daughter. Why was she abandoned?

Suddenly, a thought flashed across Qiao Nian’s mind.

The eldest daughter…

She remembered that her birthday was exactly the same as the eldest daughter of the Lu family. Even the year was the same.

How could there be such a coincidence in the world?

Could it be…

Qiao Nian seemed to have thought of something, her eyes filled with shock.

Qiao Nian’s heart sank, and she frowned.

Something was wrong with this.

Is there some misunderstanding?

Suddenly, Qiao Nian heard footsteps outside the office. She didn’t have time to think about this matter carefully, so she hurriedly put the paternity test report back in the envelope.

Qiao Nian opened the door and saw Xu Qian standing outside.

Xu Qian looked at Qiao Nian in confusion. She didn’t understand why Qiao Nian was in Doctor Sha’s office while Doctor Sha was waiting outside.

Xu Qian glanced at Qiao Nian, then at Doctor Sha, who was standing at the side. She said, “I just walked over from Miss Song’s ward. Her condition has stabilized.”

“Good. In that case, we can have her try to move around the ward tomorrow,” Doctor Sha said calmly.

Xu Qian nodded and replied, “Okay.”

When Qiao Nian heard Xu Qian mention Miss Song, she remembered Song Yue. Her face darkened.

If it weren’t for Song Yue, her brother wouldn’t have almost died.

When her brother brought Song Yue back to An City, she would definitely make her beg for death.

Hiding the hatred in her eyes, Qiao Nian quietly walked up to Doctor Sha and said very politely, “Doctor Sha, can I talk to you about Mr. Lu’s future medicine?”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Doctor Sha nodded and walked into the office.

Doctor Sha walked to the desk and took out a medicine list. He handed it to Xu Qian and instructed, “This is Miss Song’s medicine list. Go and arrange it.”

“Alright.”

Doctor Sha said politely, “You must be tired after a busy night. Go to the nurses’ station and rest. I’ll call you again if anything happens!”

“Yes.”

After Xu Qian left, Doctor Sha closed the door. His gaze landed on Qiao Nian’s face. Seeing that Qiao Nian had placed the document on his desk, he asked suspiciously, “Aren’t you going to take it away?”

Qiao Nian shook her head gently and said solemnly, “Doctor Sha, you can take a look at the contents. This matter is rather serious. I don’t want a third person to know about it. I don’t want to take it away now because I don’t have anywhere to put it. I’ll leave it with you first. Please take good care of it for me.”

“Okay,” the doctor said, opening the file. He froze when he saw what was inside. “You—you’re not going to use the identification document and acknowledge him now?”

Qiao Nian shook her head gently and said, “He’s just out of danger and needs to rest. If I put this report in front of him now, he’ll definitely be especially emotional. I think I’ll tell him about this when he’s better.”
