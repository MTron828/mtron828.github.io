“Then agree to his request!” Qiao Nian said calmly. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

When Wang Xuan thought of the lost 20 million yuan, her heart ached. The big shot had lost such a huge sum of money for nothing.

Wang Xuan sighed silently, then typed, “Okay.”

Wang Xuan took a closer look at the great god’s account. The difference between her and hi, was too great. There was no way for her to play ranked matches. She could only play a normal match.

“God, why don’t we pair up!” Wang Xuan sent a message.s

Soon, she received an invitation from Mr. Q.

Wang Xuan hurriedly handed the phone to Qiao Nian. Qiao Nian clicked to get ready.

At this moment, Wang Xuan’s heart was in her throat. She really wanted to hear the great god’s voice.

However, to Wang Xuan’s disappointment, the great god did not turn on his audio.

Wang Xuan lowered her gaze in disappointment.

Actually, Qiao Nian wasn’t curious about the great god’s voice. She was only playing the game with him to thank him for speaking up for her.

Soon, they matched up with their teammates and entered the game.

Just like before, Mr. Q chose to shoot. Qiao Nian had originally wanted to play as a mid-laner, but she was playing with Mr. Q, so she chose a support player to follow Mr. Q to the bottom lane.

When they entered the game, their teammates turned on their microphones in excitement.

Top: I’m so lucky to have met a god. Please take me up the ranks with you, god.

Top: Rich lady, are you still short of leg accessories? Can I get to know you?

Top: Little fairy, I’m a strong little puppy. Please keep me!

Mid-laner: Strong? Do you think rich women lack men? Even if you’re inlaid with diamonds, no one will like you. Don’t waste your effort.

Top: I exercise a lot. I’m in good health.

Mid-laner: Your words should be heard from the other side. Look at your ID. You’re soft and easy to push down. How is your health good?

Top: Shut up, mid-laner. What do my words have to do with you? What a busybody!

Jungler: Great god, ignore the top-laner. The top-laner is a retard.

Jungler: There’s a big shot in the top lane. I won’t help you catch him.

Top: How can you do this to me? You didn’t even come to help! I’m so disappointed in you.

The moment the top-laner finished speaking in the game, he killed the person opposite him.

Top: Did you see that? Am I outstanding? Rich lady, do you think I’m handsome? Do you want to play with me? I can carry you too.

After that, the top-laner rambled on for a long time.

Qiao Nian blocked this person without hesitation. He was too noisy.

The top-laner might have realized that his assistant had turned off the loudspeaker, so he began to type and speak a lot.

Qiao Nian couldn’t take it anymore. She entered a string of codes.

Next was the official loudspeaker. The content was very simple. The top-laner would be banned for a hundred years!

The top-laner was stunned. Then, he was killed by the other party.

Before long, the top-laner left.

Seeing this, Wang Xuan couldn’t help but laugh. She said, “He must be so angry that he smashed his phone! He can’t play games, so he can only give up!”

Mid-laner: What happened?

Jungler: I’m a little confused.

Mid-laner: Is the support an official big shot?

The jungler: That’s possible!

Mid: She should be the one who banned hooligans.

The jungler: It should be her!

Mid: Hahaha, if you ask me, the officials should strengthen the mute function of the game. That way, those keyboard warriors won’t spout nonsense.

Although they had lost a teammate, the others did not give up.

When it was time for the team battle.

Qiao Nian seized the opportunity and used her skills to suck in the archer.

The jungler took the opportunity to go on a killing spree.

Seeing this, Mr. Q hurriedly drew A and took the heads of the opposing shooter and the middle lane.

In this four-on-five battle, Qiao Nian won.
