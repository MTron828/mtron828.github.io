Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Auntie.”

“Yes?”

“Where am I?” Gu Qi had already looked around. This didn’t seem to be the hospital.

“This is the Gu family villa. It’s your…” Qiao Nian paused. She recalled that Gu Qi had never met his biological father and thought that Gu Zhou was his biological father. She said,” This is your father’s house. He knew that you were sick and was very anxious, so he brought you here. ”

Gu Qi’s confused eyes lit up. Could he live with his father?

“Does Auntie live here too?” Gu Qi asked in confusion.

“Yes, Auntie will stay here for the time being. Little Qi, don’t be afraid in the future. Auntie and your father, Gu Zhou, will protect you. If you need anything, you can tell me directly.” The reason Qiao Nian didn’t mention her relationship with Gu Zhou was because she was afraid that Gu Qi would think too much.

If she were Gu Qi, she would definitely not be able to accept it if she knew that her father had brought her home and that he had a stepmother.

Later on, she would have to tell Gu Zhou about this. For the sake of Gu Qi’s health, she would hide their relationship for the time being.

Gu Qi’s eyes lit up. He had been looking forward to staying with Auntie.

Qiao Nian’s lips curved up slightly. Looking at Gu Qi’s face, she couldn’t help but want to treat him as her own child.

She lowered her gaze, thinking that it would be better for her to spend less time with Gu Qi.

At this moment, Gu Qi reached out and grabbed Qiao Nian’s hand, gripping it tightly.

Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat. She instantly composed herself and smiled at Gu Qi. “Little Qi, what’s wrong?”

As soon as she finished speaking, Gu Qi took her hand and moved it to his chest.

Qiao Nian could hear Gu Qi’s strong heartbeat. From the sound of it, Gu Qi shouldn’t be feeling unwell. Puzzled, she looked at Gu Qi. “Little Qi, are you feeling unwell? Does your chest hurt?”

Gu Qi shook his head.

“Auntie, I want to live with you!”

Gu Qi’s words instantly filled Qiao Nian’s empty heart. Her eyes welled up with tears, but a bright smile appeared on her face. “I’m very happy to be able to live with Little Qi. Please take care of me in the future!”

Gu Qi’s ears turned red. He nodded vigorously, his eyes filled with smiles.

Qiao Nian retracted her hand and gently tucked him in. She smiled at him.

Seeing Qiao Nian like this, a blurry image suddenly flashed in Gu Qi’s mind. He froze for a moment, then grabbed Qiao Nian’s hand impatiently.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Qi’s nervous expression and was slightly stunned. She asked, “What’s wrong?”

“Auntie, I…” Gu Qi couldn’t help but grab Qiao Nian’s hand. The blurry image in his mind gradually became clearer, but he still couldn’t see the contents clearly.

“What’s wrong?” Seeing the panic in Gu Qi’s eyes, Qiao Nian felt uneasy. She comforted him softly. “Don’t be afraid. Tell Auntie everything.”

Gu Qi’s eyes gradually turned red. In the end, he remained silent.

He seemed to have seen his mommy, but he couldn’t see her clearly.

Gu Qi’s voice was a little hoarse. Looking into Qiao Nian’s star-like eyes, his heart warmed. He shook his head stubbornly.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Qi. He didn’t want to say anything more. At this moment, he looked extremely haggard. His face was pale, just like… like her child…

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian’s eyes grew redder and redder. In a daze, she seemed to see a strong light.

The light grew brighter and brighter. One could vaguely hear people talking.

“This is bad. She’s bleeding profusely now, and the child hasn’t been born yet. This won’t do. Should we save the child or the mother?”

“Protect the child. The child is very important.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“That doesn’t seem appropriate. After all, she’s the second daughter of the Qiao family.”

“Protect the mother. The child is important, but the mother is more important.”
