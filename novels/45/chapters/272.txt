Chapter 273: Mr. Dong Hua!

A gentle and delicate tune rang out from the piano room. Everyone who heard the sound of the violin instantly fell silent, slowly admiring it.

“Oh my god, it’s actually Mr. Dong Hua’s Missing!”

“This is the best version I’ve ever heard. It’s exactly the same as the original.”

“No, this is the original version!”

“Stop talking. Everyone, listen carefully.”

Everyone fell silent. They listened intently to the sound of the violin coming from the piano room. One of them closed his eyes to sense every note.

Gao Lin’s heart was racing. Her eyes were sparkling as she stared at the piano room door, her mind racing.

Only Mr. Dong Hua could play the tune of longing perfectly with the violin.

At the thought of this, Gao Lin was so excited that she could barely breathe. She knew that Mr. Dong Hua wanted to use this method to silence everyone.

Gao Lin wasn’t the only one who thought so. The other students thought so too. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Xia Xue looked at the piano door in admiration. She closed her eyes and listened carefully to the sound of the violin. Her eyes flew open, and her heart began to race. The person in the piano room must be Mr. Dong Hua.

Could it be that Mr. Dong Hua had been in the piano room since early in the morning?

Was Mr. Dong Hua thinking of practicing with her?

Xia Xue’s face turned slightly red. Her lips curved up slightly, forming a happy smile.

Xia Xue glanced at Gao Lin in satisfaction. Fortunately, Gao Lin had helped her reply to her juniors and had spoken very appropriately. She did not have to worry about offending Mr. Dong Hua for saying the wrong thing.

The violin music in the piano room gradually stopped.

Everyone was still immersed in the song “Yearning”.

After a while, everyone came back to their senses. They looked at each other. Although they were curious about the person in the piano room, no one dared to go forward to investigate.

They were very worried that if they rashly walked into the piano room, they might anger Mr. Dong Hua. If that happened, their future musical career would be ruined.

Everyone was both curious and afraid of Mr. Dong Hua. All of them felt uneasy.

At this moment, someone in the crowd asked, “Senior Xia Xue, is the person in the piano room Mr. Dong Hua?”

“That’s right, that’s right. Was Mr. Dong Hua playing the violin just now? This song is exactly the same as the one in Mr. Dong Hua’s album!”

“The live version is even more shocking than the record!”

“Mr. Dong Hua is truly amazing. If only I could be one-tenth as good as Mr. Dong Hua.”

“If I can participate in Mr. Dong Hua’s concert, I think I can die without regrets.”

“Mr. Dong Hua is a god forever!”

Everyone spoke one after another, confirming that the person in the room was indeed Mr. Dong Hua.

Apart from Mr. Dong Hua, no one else in this world could play such a beautiful violin song.

A classmate looked at Xia Xue with envy. “Senior Xia Xue, I’m really envious of you. Not only did he appoint you as his female musician, but he also specially came over to practice with you. I’m already crying with envy!”

“That’s right, that’s right. Mr. Dong Hua must have taken a liking to Senior Xia Xue’s potential. That’s why he’s training Senior Xia Xue so seriously!”

“Mr. Dong Hua is so good to Senior Xia Xue. If it were me, I would rather be single for the rest of my life!”

“Forget it. Even if you’re single for ten lifetimes, you don’t have the ability. Senior Xia Xue is a talented person. What do you have? You’re just fat!”

…

Listening to the envious praises of her classmates, Xia Xue’s lips curved up slightly. She was overjoyed.

She had not expected to benefit so much from taking someone else’s place.

Right now, she only hoped that the person she had replaced would never know for the rest of her life. Her future was bright, and no one could stop her.

She, Xia Xue, would definitely become a famous musician
