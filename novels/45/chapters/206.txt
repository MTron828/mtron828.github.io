Chapter 207: Doubts

All Matriarch Lu could think about was her eldest granddaughter, so she did not try to persuade Matriarch Gu to stay either.

Lu Qi was also feeling down. She had wanted to chat more with Qiao Nian, but she wasn’t in the mood.

Qiao Nian seemed to read Lu Qi’s mind. Smiling, she asked, “When you’re not in class, do you want to go shopping together?”

Lu Qi’s eyes instantly lit up, curving into crescents.

Matriarch Gu gazed at Lu Qi dotingly. Suddenly, a strange thought flashed across her mind. Why did she feel that Lu Qi looked a lot like Qiao Nian when she smiled?

However, Qiao Nian didn’t notice this. Supporting Matriarch Gu, she bade goodbye and left.

The butler, who had been standing beside Matriarch Lu, watched as Matriarch Gu and Qiao Nian left. Suddenly, his expression froze and he froze. “Matriarch, look at Second Young Madam Gu’s back. Don’t you think she looks exactly like our First Madam?”

The “First Madam” the butler was referring to was Lu Zhu and Lu Qi’s biological mother.

When Matriarch Lu heard the butler’s words, she instinctively replied, “How is that possible? She…”

Before Matriarch Lu finished her sentence, she glanced at Qiao Nian’s retreating back. Startled, she began to frown as well.

How was this possible?

Why did Qiao Nian look exactly like her eldest daughter-in-law?

Qiao Nian’s face appeared in Matriarch Lu’s mind, along with all the different expressions she had seen Qiao Nian wear. Abruptly, she realized that not only did Qiao Nian look exactly like her eldest daughter-in-law from behind, but her aura was also very similar to her eldest daughter-in-law’s.

Not only that, Qiao Nian’s eyes were exactly the same as Lu Qi’s.

If she didn’t know that her daughter-in-law was overseas right now, she might have really thought that Qiao Nian was her daughter-in-law!

Oh my god!

How could there be two people who looked so alike in this world?

Gazing at Qiao Nian’s retreating back, Lu Qi was stunned as well. She murmured, “She really looks like her!”

Matriarch Lu stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian, her eyes narrowing slightly.

Qiao Nian sensed their gazes on her and felt a little uncomfortable. It was only after they had walked a good distance away that the discomfort dissipated.

Could it be that Matriarch Lu didn’t like the blessing bag she had embroidered? VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian asked tentatively, “Grandma, do you think they like the blessing bag I made?”

When Matriarch Gu heard Qiao Nian’s question, she smiled gently. In a soft voice, she said, “Silly child, of course they like it. Moreover, the blessing bag you embroidered was hung up by Matriarch Lu herself. This means that she really likes the blessing bag you made.”

Qiao Nian smiled and nodded. She lowered her gaze, her eyes filled with confusion.

Since the Lu family liked her blessing bag, why did they keep staring at her?

Qiao Nian couldn’t figure it out, nor could she be bothered to think about it.

Qiao Nian helped Matriarch Gu into the car. At this moment, a white sports car drove over and stopped in the parking space behind their car.

A glamorous girl got out of the car with a smile. Her gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s back not far away, and her eyes lit up. She walked over. “Mom, when did you come back? Didn’t you say you wanted to…”

Qiao Nian heard the playful voice from behind. She turned around and saw an outstanding-looking young lady standing behind her.

She knew this young lady. She was currently the most popular young female celebrity in the entertainment industry, Song Yu.

When Song Yu took a good look at Qiao Nian’s face, the smile on her face froze. She said apologetically, “I’m sorry. I mistook you for someone else.”

Qiao Nian shook her head. “It’s fine.”

If she had such a beautiful daughter, she would definitely be very proud of her.

When Song Yu saw Matriarch Gu in the back seat of the car, she hurriedly greeted, “Hello, Madam Gu.”

Matriarch Gu nodded slightly. She did not say anything else.
