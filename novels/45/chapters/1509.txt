1510 Fake

The president’s gaze locked on Annie’s face. Seeing that he was looking at her, Annie looked away guiltily.

After Annie finished speaking, her gaze fell on the president’s face. She said mockingly, “Uncle, I told you before not to believe this woman’s nonsense. What she made is a fake. Only we can cultivate real Falling Autumn Grass! You should believe me. We’re family! I…”

“Is that so?” Qiao Nian walked up to Annie and blocked her view. She looked at the president and interrupted her without hesitation. “I don’t think so!”

Annie met Qiao Nian’s beautiful fox-like eyes. Those eyes emitted a sinister aura, scaring Annie so much that she shivered.

Qiao Nian felt that she and the president might have encountered a misunderstanding. They had always thought that the Falling Autumn Grass had stabilized the president’s illness. Now, it seemed that things weren’t that simple.

A thought flashed across Qiao Nian’s mind. Her expression changed slightly. She walked over to Chen Qing and took the Falling Autumn Grass from him, then handed the pot to Chen Qing.

Qiao Nian slowly walked over to Annie. The pot of Falling Autumn Grass in her hand had been brought over by Annie four days ago.

Annie glanced at the large pot of Falling Autumn Grass in Qiao Nian’s hand. Her lips curved up slightly, and she looked at Qiao Nian with a smile in her eyes. With a mocking expression, she said, “Open your eyes wide and take a good look. This is the real Falling Autumn Grass. Don’t use those messy things to deceive my uncle again!”

Annie paused for a moment and continued, “If you continue spouting nonsense, it means that you want to murder my aunt. Murdering Madam President is a capital crime! I advise you to think carefully!”

“Thank you for your kindness, but I know very well what I’m doing.” Qiao Nian sneered at Annie, then smashed the pot of Falling Autumn Grass in her hand to the ground.

Slap!

The flower pot shattered into countless pieces, and fragments splattered everywhere.

When Gu Zhou realized that Qiao Nian was about to smash the flower pot, he had already walked to Qiao Nian’s side and shielded her behind him.

Annie was so close to the pot that she didn’t have time to hide. Fragments of the pot closest to her cut her face.

“Ah!” Annie screamed in pain. She trembled as she covered her aching face, then lowered her hand. When she saw the bright red blood in her palm, her body trembled uncontrollably.

Could her face be disfigured?!

Her face was the most important thing in the world to her. She would never allow her face to be hurt in any way. She looked at Qiao Nian angrily, only to realize that Gu Zhou was standing in front of her.

It was all Qiao Nian’s fault. If it weren’t for Qiao Nian, how could her face have been injured?

What Annie couldn’t accept the most was that Gu Zhou was actually protecting Qiao Nian!

“You’re simply a lunatic. Why did you smash the flower pot!” Annie looked at Qiao Nian, who had walked out from behind Gu Zhou, and reprimanded her loudly.

The president and Lina, who were standing not far away, were also stunned. The two of them were not affected.

The president, who was standing beside Lina, narrowed his eyes slightly, his heart filled with confusion.

When every pot of Falling Autumn Grass was sent over, he had already gotten someone to examine it. Be it the Falling Autumn Grass, the flower pot, or the soil of the Falling Autumn Grass, there were no other harmful substances.

At this moment, Qiao Nian realized something strange about the Falling Autumn Grass.

The president stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian ignored Lina’s anger and looked at Gu Zhou, her lips curving up slightly.

Actually, when she smashed the flower pot, she calculated the angle in advance. However, she did not expect Gu Zhou to still be worried that she would be injured and run over to protect her.

It felt so good to be protected by Gu Zhou. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Although she could do many things alone, she still hoped that Gu Zhou could always protect and care for her. Perhaps every young lady who was immersed in love felt this way.
