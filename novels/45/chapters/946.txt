Qiao Nian frowned slightly and asked uncertainly, “You said that Eldest Senior Brother taught you?”

“Yes.” Qin Chuan frowned, not relaxing at all. He said, “Back then, Eldest Senior Brother told me that you had lost control of your emotions. If that happened, you might become mentally ill, so he taught me to hypnotize you.”

Qiao Nian frowned and lowered her gaze. She felt a little strange. Why was Eldest Senior Brother also involved in this matter?

“At that time, I helped you hypnotize yourself, wanting you to forget about the pregnancy and childbirth. However, your obsession with your children was too deep, so I could only let you forget a portion and slightly modify a portion of your memories.”

“Yes, when I went there, you had already fainted. The two children beside you were no longer breathing and their hearts were beating. Sigh…” Qin Chuan sighed heavily and said, “After hypnotizing you, I cremated those two children. Since your children are still alive, it means that someone swapped your children back then!”

When Qiao Nian heard Qin Chuan’s words, her expression faltered slightly. It seemed that Qin Chuan had only seen two children back then and not her third child.

Who exactly had taken her child?

Where exactly had the third child gone?

Qin Chuan said, “Actually, even if you can’t remember what happened during the birth, I plan to investigate carefully. When I rushed to your place, I felt that something was a little strange, but I couldn’t say what was strange!”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. “What do you mean by that?”

“I keep feeling that something’s wrong, so I’ve been investigating your childbirth for so many years. However, I’m sorry, I haven’t found any more information.” At this point, Qin Chuan couldn’t help but grip his phone tightly. “However, you have to prepare for the worst. If you can’t control your emotions, you might…”

Qiao Nian’s phone slipped to the ground, her beautiful fox-like eyes filled with sorrow.

Worst-case scenario.

Qiao Nian’s lips trembled slightly.

Seeing that Gu Qi and Xiao Shi were alive and well, she naturally thought that the third child was also alive.

However, Qin Chuan’s words made her realize that perhaps that child had already…

Qiao Nian’s eyes instantly turned red. She sniffled and bent down to pick up her phone, but she couldn’t.

Her hands were trembling, and her entire body was shaking. She stood up and tried to pick up the phone, but she fell to her knees.

At this moment, she heard footsteps beside her. She looked over and saw a pair of men’s leather shoes.

Gu Zhou bent down and picked up his phone. He kept looking into Qiao Nian’s eyes. Seeing that her eyes were red, he reached out and helped her up. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

He sensed that Qiao Nian was trembling. A trace of surprise flashed across his eyes as he looked at her worriedly.

Qiao Nian took a few deep breaths and finally managed to calm herself down. She smelled the unique fragrance from Gu Zhou, but what puzzled her was that Gu Zhou still smelled of smoke.

She calmed down and took the phone from Gu Zhou. She looked up at Gu Zhou, a trace of confusion flashing in her eyes.

Had something happened to Gu Zhou? Why was he smoking? He had never smoked in the past.

At the thought of Gu Qi and Xiao Shi’s faces, she silently looked away, not daring to meet Gu Zhou’s eyes.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian’s face and asked in a low voice, frowning, “You didn’t sleep well last night?”

Qiao Nian gripped her phone tightly, trying hard to suppress the uneasiness and pain in her heart. She continued, “Yes, after I came back last night, I wasn’t sleepy anymore so I didn’t want to sleep anymore.”

Seeing the dark circles under Qiao Nian’s eyes, Gu Zhou bent down and picked her up in his arms.

Just like that, Qiao Nian’s shoes fell to the ground. She let out a cry of surprise and subconsciously wrapped her arms around Gu Zhou’s neck. “W-What are you doing?”

“You should rest well now!” Gu Zhou looked down into Qiao Nian’s eyes and said gently.

Qiao Nian’s ears turned slightly red. She hurriedly said, “I… I can walk.”

However, Gu Zhou didn’t speak. He walked to the bed and carefully placed Qiao Nian on it, not forgetting to cover her with the blanket.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou. His face was like the most perfect masterpiece of God. His eyes were deep, and his nose was high. Any young lady who saw him might fall for him.
