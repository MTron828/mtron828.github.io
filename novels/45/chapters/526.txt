When he heard Qiao Nian’s even breathing, the coldness on his face gradually dissipated. His eyes lit up.

His lips moved slightly as he called out softly, “Nian’er…”

However, the only response he got was Qiao Nian’s breathing.

During this period of time, Qiao Nian had been guarding Lu Zhu. Her mind and body had been in a state of high tension, so she had fallen asleep.

As she was too tired, she fell into a deep sleep. She did not hear the man’s voice.

Gu Chuan called out again, “Nian’er…”

However, Qiao Nian still didn’t respond.

Gu Chuan pursed his thin lips into a straight line. Gradually, a trace of doubt flashed across his eyes. He didn’t understand why he had addressed Qiao Nian this way.

However, his heart was beating violently. His brain subconsciously told him that he really knew a woman called Nian’er. Moreover, that woman was very important to him… 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Except he could no longer remember why this woman was not in his memory.

Moreover, he did not understand why he had called her by that name so affectionately.

He was even more confused about how he had returned to this hotel.

Gu Chuan moved his body slightly and felt Qiao Nian’s softness and his warm embrace. His lips curled up slightly, and his eyes were filled with smiles.

It felt really good to be hugged by her like this.

… .

The next day, the sky cleared.

The rain was heavy last night. The sanitation workers who woke up early had already cleaned up the rain on the ground.

Qiao Nian stirred in a daze. She slowly opened her eyes and saw Gu Zhou’s handsome face in front of her.

Without warning, she met those deep eyes, and her heart suddenly raced.

Only then did Qiao Nian notice that she was nestled in Gu Zhou’s arms, her legs still wrapped around his. At this moment, she was like a koala bear.

Qiao Nian’s face instantly turned red. She hurriedly retracted her leg and silently retracted her hand. She moved back and said carefully, “W-why didn’t you call me?”

Gu Zhou moved his body slightly. Only then did he realize that his body was almost numb.

“I’ve heard that you’ve been so busy lately that you haven’t had time to sleep.”

So that was his reason for allowing her to cuddle him to sleep.

Qiao Nian stared intently at Gu Zhou, listening to his voice. His eyes were as cold as usual, and there was a hint of scrutiny in them.

Her heart instantly fell back into her throat.

Gu Zhou was finally awake.

The person in front of her was really Gu Zhou.

At this thought, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief.

She did not have time to guess what Gu Zhou was thinking now. She asked with concern, “Gu Zhou, feel your body carefully. Do you feel any discomfort?”

Or perhaps, were there any strange memories?

However, Gu Zhou remained calm and asked, “What should I feel unwell about?”

Hearing Gu Zhou’s words, Qiao Nian remembered that Gu Zhou had a split personality. He wasn’t sick now, so he probably wouldn’t remember what his other personalities had done.

Qiao Nian smiled awkwardly and hurriedly corrected herself. “Nothing. I was just concerned about you. By the way, why did you suddenly come back?”

Qiao Nian naturally didn’t dare to casually tell Gu Zhou about what his other personalities had done when he had split personalities.

Gu Zhou’s eyes moved slightly, and a trace of confusion appeared in his eyes.

In fact, he did not remember clearly what had happened before.

He vaguely remembered that he was in a hotel. When he woke up, he saw Qiao Nian hugging him to sleep.

He originally thought that Chen Qing had sent him back because he was sick.
