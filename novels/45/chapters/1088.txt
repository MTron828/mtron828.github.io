1089 Slut

Each picture was marked with a time.

Su Xue had transferred a million yuan to the company account on the day Su Xue brought Qiao Nian back to the Qiao family.

Qiao Shan’s mind raced. He recalled what Su Xue had said previously. At that time, Su Xue had said that she had taken a liking to the one million yuan Qiao Nian had, so she wanted to bring Qiao Nian home.

At that time, Qiao Shan had a nagging feeling that something was wrong with this matter.

!!

Qiao Shan slowly closed his eyes and thought about what had happened again.

According to Qiao Xin, Su Xue often went to the beauty salon. Su Xue’s salary wasn’t high. He often transferred money to Su Xue, but it was also fixed every month!

According to Qiao Xin, Su Xue should have many lovers. Those lovers should all need Su Xue to spend money on them!

Now, it seemed that Su Xue had taken more than a million yuan from Qiao Nian!

Qiao Shan wished he could smash his phone and tear the letter into shreds and throw it on the ground. He couldn’t do this. He could only suppress his anger!

Su Xue!

His good wife!

She was actually so lewd outside!

She was indeed a b*tch!

Qiao Shan’s eyes were filled with killing intent. He yearned to tear Su Xue into pieces!

At this moment, there was a knock on the door.

Qiao Shan put away the hatred in his eyes and folded the letter Qiao Xin had written him before putting it into his pocket. He didn’t want the servants to know that he was a cuckold!

Qiao Shan finally regained his composure, but there was still some anger on his face. He said coldly, “Come in!”

Su Xue walked in dejectedly. Her mind was filled with thoughts of Qiao Xin being locked up. Qiao Xin was her precious daughter, and she yearned to be the one locked up!

Su Xue didn’t have time to look at Qiao Shan’s face. Her mind was filled with Qiao Xin’s matters. Her eyes were red, and her voice was choked with emotion. “Hubby, what should we do now? If Qiao Xin goes to jail like this, her life will really be ruined. We can’t let our daughter be ruined. Why don’t you think of something? Ah… what are you doing? It hurts so much. Ah…”

Before Su Xue could finish speaking, Qiao Shan, who was sitting in a wheelchair, had already smashed a stool at Su Xue viciously. He did it again and again, as if he wanted to beat Su Xue to death!

Su Xue immediately took a few steps back to avoid Qiao Shan’s beating. She looked at Qiao Shan in disbelief and questioned, “What are you doing? I didn’t even expose you just now. Why did you hit me?”

“You still have the cheek to speak?” If it weren’t for the fact that Qiao Shan hadn’t gotten used to the prosthetic limb on his leg, he would have stood up and beaten Su Xue up long ago. He was so angry that his eyes were red, and he was panting heavily! 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Su Xue hid on the other side and looked at Qiao Shan with a pained expression. She questioned, “Qiao Shan, are you crazy? We were going to discuss what to do with our daughter now. Why did you hit me?”

The more Su Xue thought about it, the angrier she became. Her precious daughter had been taken away, and she was already very flustered. Now that Qiao Shan still wanted to hit her, she felt both sad and aggrieved. “Qiao Shan, other than hitting me at home every time, what else can you do? You only hit me at home. When you’re outside, you become a coward. Why did I fall for a useless man like you back then!”

“No matter how cowardly I am, I’m still better than you. How dare you embezzle the company’s public funds to support men, and so many lovers? You’re quite good at playing around. Can’t so many men satisfy you?”

Su Xue’s entire face froze. She looked at Qiao Shan in disbelief, her mind racing.

Could Qiao Nian have told Qiao Shan about this?

Qiao Nian, that b*tch!

She knew that Qiao Nian would never let her off!

Qiao Shan looked at Su Xue coldly and said, “I didn’t expect to have underestimated you. You’re so unwilling to be be alone. You have to raise a lover outside. Pfft, you’re really despicable!”

The more Qiao Shan spoke, the angrier he became. He grabbed the alarm clock on the table beside him and threw it at Su Xue.

“Ah!”

The alarm clock hit Su Xue’s foot. Su Xue screamed in pain!

Su Xue looked down and saw that her foot had been smashed. She frowned. Did Qiao Shan really want to kill her?

No, Qiao Shan wouldn’t kill her. What if Qiao Shan sent her to prison for embezzlement?!

She didn’t want to go to prison. She didn’t want to be tainted forever.

“Hubby, don’t believe that b*tch Qiao Nian’s words.” Su Xue hurriedly begged for mercy, kneeling beside Qiao Shan’s wheelchair. “Qiao Nian lied to you. I took the company’s money because my family…”

“Bam!”
