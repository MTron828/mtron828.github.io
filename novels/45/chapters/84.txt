Chapter 85: Acupuncture

Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

Gu Zhou was staring at her. When he saw her looking over, his hand moved to rest on his belt buckle. His beautiful eyes were filled with laughter.

“Crack!”

The sound of his belt being unbuckled.

Gu Zhou pulled down the zipper of his trousers in a leisurely manner. Seeing Qiao Nian’s face turn red, he took his time removing his trousers.

“You don’t have to take all your clothes off!” Turning away, Qiao Nian walked into the bathroom.

Qiao Nian stood in the shower, holding a silver needle in her hand. Gu Zhou walked over, his pace unhurried. The lower half of his body was wrapped in a towel.

Gu Zhou stepped into the bathtub and sat down calmly, his brow furrowed.

The bathroom was filled with steam. A heavy fog encircled the two occupants.

At this moment, Gu Zhou, who was sitting in the bathtub, looked practically edible.

“T’ve prepared a packet for the medicinal herbs. You don’t have to worry about the medicinal dregs getting on your body,” Qiao Nian said. She was just about to begin the acupuncture procedure when the door to the bathroom was pushed open.

Zhao Qian had thought that Gu Zhou was in the study, not the bathroom. Hence, she planned to send over the towels that the servants had washed. The moment she entered the bathroom, she saw Gu Zhou sitting in the bathtub with Qiao Nian standing next to it.

Zhao Qian’s face instantly flushed red. Hugging the towels to herself, she quickly turned around.

“Get out!” Gu Zhou glared at Zhao Qian coldly.

Zhao Qian’s face was bright red. Her hands, which were wrapped around the towels, tightened their hold involuntarily. Blinking her eyes in confusion, she said, “B-Brother, I’m sorry. I-I didn’t mean to disturb you and Second Sister-in-law!”

“L…” Zhao Qian pursed her lips, her voice trembling as she spoke.” I… I just wanted to help the servants bring the towels over. I thought you were in the study! ”

“Close the door. I don’t like to be disturbed.” Gu Zhou looked at Zhao Qian coldly, his eyes dark.

Ina panic, Zhao Qian walked towards the door and left, closing it behind her.

It was only after Zhao Qian left that the realization struck her. Second Brother had truly fallen for Qiao Nian!

Meanwhile, Qiao Nian didn’t think too much about it. Reaching into the bathtub, she inadvertently touched Gu Zhou’s arm. Instantly, she thought of the perfect lines defining his arm and hurriedly retracted her hand.

Gu Zhou’s eyes opened wide. He stared at Qiao Nian.

Their eyes met.

A thick mist settled over them.

Qiao Nian was acutely aware that Gu Zhou’s expression was turning darker and darker. His beautiful phoenix-like eyes were narrowed and the temperature in the bathroom had dropped. She immediately said, “Medicinal baths require acupuncture. I’m your doctor. I’m not trying to take advantage of you.”

“So Mrs. Gu really doesn’t like me. Looks like she plans to continue going on blind dates.” Gu Zhou spoke, his voice just a little hoarse.

Was Gu Zhou joking again?

But wasn’t this matter over?

He had just called her Doctor Qiao, and now he was calling her Mrs. Gu. In the next moment, would he tease her and call her darling again?

“I went to that blind date to help a friend out. How many men in this world can compare to Master Gu?” Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou with a smile. Seeing that Gu Zhou remained silent, she teased, “Is Master Gu shy?”

Gu Zhou glared at Qiao Nian coldly. His entire body was radiating a frigid aura. He didn’t look shy at all, but more like he didn’t want anyone to touch him.

Qiao Nian suddenly recalled that Gu Zhou had a phobia of women. Was he despising her for being a woman?

If she was a man, wouldn’t it be two men in the bathroom instead.

“Tm a doctor and you’re my patient. It’s normal for us to touch. You don’t have to think too much about it. If you really can’t take it, why don’t you imagine me as a man?” Qiao Nian said, completely serious.

Gu Zhou’s expression grew even darker.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou, not understanding why he was angry again.

“Thank you for your trouble,” Gu Zhou said indifferently.

Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. She took out a silver needle and began to perform acupuncture on Gu Zhou.

When she inserted the first needle, she could clearly feel Gu Zhou’s body move in response. She said comfortingly, “The acupuncture should still hurt a little. Don’t resist it. You’ll recover soon..”Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m
