Chapter 252: Invitation to Perform

Holding onto Xia Xue’s arm, Gao Lin walked towards the school building.

Along the way, Gao Lin chattered excitedly. Very few people could gain Brother Cao’s favor.

If Xia Xue could become Mr. Dong Hua’s female musician this time, and if she could be Xia Xue’s assistant, wouldn’t she become famous?

Then could she take the opportunity to debut?

At the thought of this, Gao Lin was secretly delighted.

Gao Lin turned to look at Xia Xue and asked with a smile, “Sister Xia Xue, what do you think of the way Brother Cao looked at you? I thought he liked you a lot!”

Even now, Xia Xue still felt as if she were in a dream. She felt that all of this was a little unreal. When she heard Gao Lin’s question, she thought for a while and said with a smile, “I think Brother Cao is still very satisfied with my violin playing, but Brother Cao has always worked under Mr. Dong Hua. He must have been influenced by a lot of especially good music. I’m a little worried that he thinks that my violin skills are not good enough!”

“No? I think Brother Cao likes you very much. Didn’t he ask us to come back and wait for news?” At this point, Gao Lin told her what she had heard from rumors. “I heard that Brother Cao has always been famous for liking women. If he smiles at you, it means that he likes you very much! Brother Cao has been smiling at you ever since he heard you play the violin!”

“I hope so!” Xia Xue felt a trace of anticipation in her heart. However, she was curious if the music played by the person who was in the training room was as good as hers.

Seeing how insecure Xia Xue was, Gao Lin thought that she was still worried. She quickly consoled her, “Sister Xia Xue, don’t worry. Nothing will happen to you. How many people in our entire school have better grades than you?”

Xia Xue took Gao Lin’s words to heart. She had always gotten first place in every exam.

Gao Lin continued to comfort her. “Sister Xia Xue, you have to know that Brother Cao is Mr. Dong Hua’s manager. How can someone like him praise others so easily? He greeted you with a smile today, and he seemed to think very highly of you. Don’t worry, Sister Xia Xue, I believe you can do it. Also, my future depends on you!”

When Xia Xue heard Gao Lin’s words, it was as if she could already see the bright future ahead. She stood on the stage, wearing a noble gown and holding her own concert elegantly.

As the two of them spoke, Xia Xue’s phone suddenly rang.

The two of them looked at each other, their hearts in their throats.

Seeing Xia Xue standing there, unmoving, Gao Lin reminded her softly, “Sister Xia Xue, your phone is ringing. Pick up!”

Only then did Xia Xue come back to her senses. She took out her phone from her bag and saw Brother Cao’s call. She was so shocked that she forgot to breathe.

“Oh my god, Brother Cao. He called you so quickly. Sister Xia Xue, pick up the phone quickly. He must be trying to tell you the good news. Congratulations on becoming Mr. Dong Hua’s female musician!” Gao Lin said excitedly.

Xia Xue’s heart began to beat faster and faster as she listened to Gao Lin’s words. She looked at her phone in anticipation. She took a deep breath and tried hard to calm herself down before answering the call. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Hello.” Xia Xue’s hand trembled slightly as she held the phone.

Gao Lin hurriedly moved closer to Xia Xue’s phone to eavesdrop.

“Miss Xia, I’m very happy that you’ve been selected to participate in Mr. Dong Hua’s concert. I’ll send you a copy of the score for the concert. Please practice well during this period!”

Brother Cao’s voice came from the phone.

When Xia Xue heard this, she was so excited that she almost couldn’t breathe. After a long while, she held the phone with both hands and said gently, “Thank you, thank you. I’m truly grateful. I’ll definitely practice the score well. I won’t embarrass Mr. Dong Hua!”

“Sure!”

Xia Xue suddenly wanted to see the rumored Mr. Dong Hua. She grabbed her phone and asked carefully, “Brother Cao, can I see Mr. Dong Hua in the future?”
