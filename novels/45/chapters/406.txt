The joy in Qiao Yu’s eyes instantly disappeared, and he was as calm and indifferent as ever.

Today, Qiao Nian was wearing a long red dress. Her long, seaweed-like hair draped over her shoulders. Coupled with her beautiful fox eyes, she looked indescribably seductive, but not tacky at all.

Everyone who passed by Qiao Nian couldn’t help but take a few more glances at her. Their gazes couldn’t help but fall on her jade-like feet, which were wrapped in black high heels.

Qiao Yu couldn’t help but swallow. His eyes instantly turned cold, and his voice carried a hint of displeasure. “Do you have a brain? This is MY, and it’s also the most chaotic country in the world. The women here have the highest casualty rates. What are you trying to do by wearing this?”

Qiao Nian’s beautiful foxy eyes narrowed slightly. Even though Qiao Yu’s tone was very unfriendly, she could still hear a hint of concern in his words.

Qiao Nian held onto Lu Zhu’s arm and smiled. “Mr. Qiao, you’re worrying too much. I believe no one will dare to covet Young Master Lu’s female companion.”

Seeing that Qiao Nian was about to stick to Lu Zhu, Qiao Yu’s eyes turned even colder. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Standing at the side, Lu Zhu frowned slightly. He could smell the tension between Qiao Yu and Qiao Nian, but he was a little surprised.

Wasn’t Qiao Yu Qiao Nian’s brother?

Why did their relationship seem so cold?

Besides, why did Qiao Nian address Qiao Yu as Mr. Qiao?

However, Lu Zhu had never been a meddlesome person. He would not ask too much about other people’s matters.

Lu Zhu lowered his eyes slightly, his gaze falling on Qiao Nian’s hand, which was holding his arm. A trace of surprise flashed across his heart.

He had thought that he would be very against Qiao Nian.

Standing behind Lu Zhu, Lin Nan was also stunned. His young master had never liked being touched by others.

For a moment, the atmosphere suddenly froze.

At that moment, a man in a tuxedo walked over from the side with several bodyguards behind him.

His hair was combed back, and he had a gentle smile on his face. His every move was filled with a gentlemanly aura.

Qiao Nian looked at this man and found him inexplicably familiar.

“Mr. Lu and Mr. Qiao, I’m sure Old Master will be very happy that the two of you are willing to come here to support him!”

Old Master…

Qiao Nian suddenly remembered that this man in front of her was probably the chairman of HH Group, Old Master Cui’s personal secretary, Mr. Chen.

Old Master Cui had always kept a low profile and rarely went out. Few people knew him, but the public knew Mr. Chen very well.

Since Mr. Chen was Old Master Cui’s most trusted person, everyone addressed him respectfully.

Mr. Chen was a slick person. His gaze landed on Qiao Nian’s face. Seeing that Qiao Nian was holding Lu Zhu’s arm, he smiled and asked, “This must be Mrs. Lu!”

Lu Zhu shook his head gently and introduced, “Qiao Nian, my friend.”

When Mr. Chen heard Lu Zhu’s words, his gaze lingered on Qiao Nian’s face for a moment. Then, he reached out his hand and greeted her with a smile. “Miss Qiao, nice to meet you.”

Qiao Nian smiled and reached out to shake Mr. Chen’s hand, then retracted her hand.

Then, Mr. Chen, Lu Zhu, and Qiao Yu exchanged a few pleasantries.

Qiao Nian keenly noticed that both Lu Zhu and Qiao Yu were very polite to Mr. Chen.

It seemed that the HH Group could not be underestimated.

Mr. Chen smiled at them and said, “Everyone, feel free to play. Please forgive me if I haven’t treated you well!”

Lu Zhu pursed her lips and smiled slightly. “Mr. Chen, you’re too polite!”

Mr. Chen came over and only said a few words to resolve the conflict between everyone.

Qiao Nian gave Qiao Yu a cold look, then followed Lu Zhu to register for a room key.
