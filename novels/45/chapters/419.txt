Chapter 420: It’s Him?

“She’s even pretending to be weak and sitting on the ground. Why? Must I marry her?” Ah Rao said with a troubled expression.

Gao Hong was shocked.

When Gao Hong heard that man slander her, her expression changed drastically. She scolded angrily, “You’re just a hooligan. How could I throw myself at you? You’re dreaming! You’re just spouting nonsense and slandering my reputation. Are you still a man?!”

Ah Rao said nonchalantly, “You know best whether I’m a man or not!”

When Qiao Nian heard Ah Rao’s words, she laughed out loud. This bodyguard was so impressive. He was even arguing back.

Gao Quan’s face turned red with anger when he saw how shameless Ah Rao was. He shouted angrily, “Wang Chuan, chop off his hands and feet! Then cut off his tongue!”

Ah Rao immediately shielded Qiao Nian behind him and looked at Gao Quan casually.

Qiao Nian looked at Ah Rao’s back and couldn’t help but smile.

This bodyguard was really dutiful.

Wang Chuan was originally checking Gao Hong’s wound. When he heard Gao Quan call out to him, he stood up and rolled up his sleeves, preparing to fight.

Ah Rao calmly unbuttoned his sleeve and slowly folded it, revealing his healthy wheat-colored wrist. He slowly looked up at Wang Chuan.

His lazy attitude showed that he did not take Wang Chuan seriously at all.

Wang Chuan took a step forward with a cold expression. His gaze landed on the face of the man in front of him and he frowned slightly. This man looked familiar.

......

Suddenly, an idea flashed across Wang Chuan’s mind, and his pupils instantly dilated.

That’s him?

How could it be him?

Didn’t he quit long ago?

A trace of fear surged in Wang Chuan’s heart. He swallowed and did not dare to step forward.

Seeing that Wang Chuan was still not approaching him, Gao Quan asked impatiently, “What are you doing? Why aren’t you hitting him?”

Wang Chuan clenched his fists tightly, his palms sweating profusely.

Even if he had ten times more guts, he wouldn’t dare to attack!

The man in front of him was a god in the bodyguard world.

If he fought him, he would be risking his life.

No one knew his name, only that there was a Rao in it.

It was said that he did not leave the mountain easily, nor did he protect others easily. It was said that the last employer he protected was his childhood sweetheart.

It was said that the son of the chairman of that group had hit his employer. It was said that he had only slapped her once. Then, he barged into that group and crippled that person’s son in front of the chairman.

From then on, only his legend remained in the bodyguard world.

What was going on? Why had he come out again?

He was actually doing this for a small fry like Qiao Nian.

That wasn’t right. Could it be that Qiao Nian had some powerful background?

Seeing that Wang Chuan did not dare to attack, Gao Quan scolded him angrily. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Gao Quan rolled up his sleeves and was about to do it himself.

Ah Rao stood calmly, looking down at him as if he were a harmless ant.

Just as Gao Quan was about to make a move, the host walked over and said with a faint smile on his face, “Mr. Gao, I’m really sorry. Fighting is not allowed during the competition. If you really want to make a move, then I’ll have to forfeit your participation. Please think twice before you act!”

When Gao Quan heard the host say this, he could only suppress his anger and try his best to control himself.

Ah Rao’s gaze landed on the host’s face and he asked very politely, “Can we fight outside the arena?”

He said the most arrogant words in the calmest tone.

The corners of Qiao Nian’s mouth curled up slightly. She suddenly understood why Gu Zhou had asked Ah Rao to be her bodyguard. The two of them were very compatible, and both of them were unwilling to be wronged.

The others discussed it.
