Chapter 1766 - 1766 Breaking His Defense

“Alright, I’ll go back and prepare!” Chen Sheng’s jade-like eyes were sparkling, as if he was looking forward to the future.

“Go!” Cui Huai waved his hand at Chen Sheng, indicating for him to leave. He looked at Chen Sheng’s back as he left, as if he was looking at himself after so many years.

At that time, when the president was forced to a dead end by Earl Mark, he had also encouraged the president like this, hoping that the president could resist Earl Mark.

They had won that battle!

Cui Huai only hoped that they could win this battle as well!

When Chen Sheng went out of the room, he saw that Sha He and Ba Song were still sitting on the sofa. One was reading the newspaper, and the other was playing games on his phone.

When the two of them saw Chen Sheng come out, they quickly went up to him.

Ba Song asked impatiently, “What did Boss say just now?”

Chen Sheng smiled and did not say anything. He quickly walked out.

After Chen Sheng left HH Corporation, he drove home.

At this moment, his cell phone, which was in the car, rang. Chen Sheng looked at the caller ID on his cell phone and picked up the call.

Chang Feng’s voice came from the phone. “I just found out that Cui Huai’s six snipers were aiming at Cui Huai’s office from all angles. Who did Cui Huai see just now?”

“It’s me.” Chen Sheng tapped the steering wheel with his fingers, his voice happy.

Actually, he had long known that Cui Huai had many snipers around him, but he was not worried at all, because Chang Feng would get rid of those snipers.

Chang Feng heard Chen Sheng’s relaxed voice and asked with a smile, “Is everything going well?”

“Yes.” Chen Sheng looked straight ahead and thought of Cui Huai’s hateful eyes. He continued, “Cui Huai hates the president even more than we thought. If Mark hadn’t been suppressing him, he might have gone back to take revenge long ago!”

No matter how scheming a person was, when it came to a blood feud, it was easy to let down their guard.

It was precisely because of this that Chen Sheng had an opportunity.

However, no matter what, the outcome was good. They could follow Cui Huai to Europe directly and tell Gu Zhou the internal situation.

“Alright, you should go home too. Let’s pack up together and go to Europe tomorrow.” Chen Sheng reminded with a smile, “Boss has already removed all the people monitoring us.”

Chang Feng could not help but grip his cell phone tightly. His breathing became heavier. Then, he asked seriously, “Then can we meet them?”

Chang Feng was referring to Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian.

When Chen Sheng heard Chang Feng’s words, the light in his eyes gradually lit up, and the corners of his lips curled up slightly. However, his voice was as calm as ever. “Yes.”

Now that he could contact them, it meant that their mission had been perfectly completed.

In Europe.

A Maybach stopped directly at the entrance of Mark Manor. Qiao Nian and Chen Qing helped the pale Wright out of the car.

At this moment, Qiao Nian’s cell phone rang. She took out her cell phone and looked at the screen. Her eyes lit up. She pushed Wright away from her and held the cell phone with both hands.

Seeing that Wright was about to fall to the ground, Chen Qing grabbed him. He could not let Wright fall. It had not been easy for him to feed him so many medicinal herbs and treat him. He could not treat him again just because he fell.

“Send him back to his room first. I’ll make a call.”

Qiao Nian walked towards the forest not far from the manor. She looked around carefully and heaved a sigh of relief when she didn’t see any cameras.

Chen Qing’s heart surged when he saw Qiao Nian’s excitement, but he didn’t show it on his face. He just helped Wright towards his castle.

Chen Qing dragged Wright to the door on the first floor. As soon as he pushed open the door, he saw Lina walking over from the end of the corridor.

The two of them looked at each other face to face, both trying to control the surprise on their faces.

Lina pursed her lips slightly and took a deep breath before walking towards the door.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

She glanced at Chen Qing and Wright before looking behind Chen Qing. When she saw that there was no one behind her, surprise flashed across her eyes.
