749 Confession

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian with a complicated expression. His gaze moved to the document in his hand, then he handed it to Qiao Nian. “I think this matter is very important. I have to tell you.”

A trace of surprise flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes. She took the document back from Gu Zhou. Her hand trembled slightly, but she didn’t open the document.

If this was just an ordinary document, Qiao Nian wouldn’t be so afraid. What if this document was the paternity test report of Gu Zhou and Gu Qi?

She had yet to figure out how to face this paternity test report.

Gu Zhou seemed to sense Qiao Nian’s hesitation. He pursed his lips and said in a low and hoarse voice, “Open it!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Qiao Nian looked at the document in her hand stiffly, her brows furrowed deeply.

After a while, Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou.

Sunlight filtered through the French windows, bathing Gu Zhou in a layer of golden light. He looked much gentler.

She could see the seriousness in Gu Zhou’s eyes. He really hoped that she would open this document.

If this really contained Gu Zhou and Gu Qi’s paternity test documents, it meant that Gu Zhou had already opened his heart to her and was willing to share his secrets with her.

Since Gu Zhou had already gotten over it, she shouldn’t continue to be conflicted.

Some things could not be avoided. They had to be resolved eventually.

There was no time like the present. They should resolve all these matters today.

After thinking everything through, Qiao Nian opened the folder.

When she took out the document inside, she saw the words “Paternity Test” on the first page.

Qiao Nian silently finished reading the entire document. She didn’t know what expression to make, because she had long known about this.

Just as Qiao Nian was at a loss for words, she heard Gu Zhou say hoarsely, “This is a copy of the document you have.”

Qiao Nian’s beautiful fox-like eyes widened uncontrollably. She hadn’t expected Gu Zhou to already know that she had gone for a paternity test.

She touched her nose and asked in surprise, “How did you know?”

She finally understood. When they were in the living room just now, Gu Zhou had already known about her visit to the paternity test center.

Gu Zhou was just waiting for her to take the initiative to ask. Perhaps he did not expect her to change the topic.

Could it be that Gu Zhou had wanted to tell her about this to begin with?

“I’m Gu Qi’s father.” Gu Zhou’s dark eyes were stained with a thick layer of ink.

Qiao Nian felt as if a bolt of lightning had struck her, shocking her to the core. For a moment, she didn’t know how to react.

She had already known that Gu Zhou and Gu Qi were father and son, but knowing was one thing and hearing Gu Zhou say it himself was another.

At this moment, Gu Zhou was staring unblinkingly at her, as if waiting for her response…

Qiao Nian hesitated for a moment before saying, “Actually, this is your own business. You don’t have to tell me everything…”

“Husband and wife should be honest with each other.”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she recalled that Gu Zhou had previously told her that Gu Qi was just a relative’s child. She pursed her lips slightly and continued, “You lied to me previously!”

Gu Zhou stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian, a trace of pain flashing in his eyes. After a long while, he said, “I just hadn’t thought of how to tell you.”

Qiao Nian recalled that her marriage with Gu Zhou was just a deal. A nonchalant smile appeared on her face as she said, “When we first got together, we didn’t know each other well. It’s normal for you to hide something from me.”

Gu Zhou’s breathing hitched, and his brow furrowed deeper and deeper. His voice was like a voice from hell, making one shiver. “Do you really not care at all?”

“Yeah.” A faint smile appeared on Qiao Nian’s face as she handed the document to Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou lowered his gaze slightly and took the document from Qiao Nian. There was a hint of disappointment in his voice as he asked, “Don’t you want to know who Gu Qi’s mother is?”
