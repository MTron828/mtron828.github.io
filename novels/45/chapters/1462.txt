1463 Pushing the Blame

“You’re still spouting nonsense and shirking responsibility!” the president’s secretary said eloquently!

The secretary shivered in fear and stood quietly at the side.

The president’s gaze lingered on David and Gu Zhou’s faces. In the end, he seemed to have made a decision and enunciated each word clearly. “Alright, ten hours it is. But I want to see Lina now!”

Gu Zhou pondered for a moment and nodded. He glanced at Chen Qing.

Chen Qing immediately understood what Gu Zhou meant. Chen Qing turned around and entered the room. When Chen Qing came out, he was holding a tablet computer.

Chen Qing handed the tablet to the president. On the tablet was a screenshot of the surveillance video of Lina’s ward.

The president’s secretary hurriedly took the tablet and handed it to the president with both hands.

The president’s gaze fell on the tablet. When he saw Lina lying on the hospital bed with a pained expression, his eyes were filled with sorrow.

How did this happen?

How had his precious daughter been injured?

He had made plans to surround Bear Mountain. How did those people enter Bear Mountain?

Before coming to the hospital, he had investigated Gu Zhou’s whereabouts. He really hadn’t expected Gu Zhou to have so many mercenaries.

Could it be that Gu Zhou had long set up defenses on Bear Mountain?

As a scenic area in Europe, Bear Mountain was usually visited by many tourists, and it was impossible for anyone who entered the scenic area to carry a gun.

Someone who could enter Bear Mountain with a gun must have dodged the European security system. That kind of person was definitely not an ordinary person.

Gu Zhou had just arrived in Europe. It was impossible for him to have made so many preparations in advance. Moreover, his daughter had only met Gu Zhou last night. In just one night, Gu Zhou had been able to hide from so many people and set up an ambush on Bear Mountain. Was that possible?

There were many bodyguards around Lina. All of them had followed Lina to Bear Mountain. It seemed that they were also injured.

If Gu Zhou had done all of this, then he had to be wary of his strength.

If it were anyone else who had done all of this, they would definitely want him to fall out with Gu Zhou and use him to kill Gu Zhou.

Those people were really too cunning!

If only Lina had more bodyguards by her side. Then Lina wouldn’t have been injured!

When the President opened his eyes again, they were calm, as if nothing had happened. All his emotions were suppressed.

He raised his hand and glanced at the time on his wrist. He looked at Gu Zhou coldly. “I’ll give you ten hours. Once the time is up, if you haven’t returned Lina to me, today next year will be the anniversary of your death. This will be your cemetery!”

The European President’s words were powerful and oppressive.

Gu Zhou met his gaze calmly and nodded. “It’s a deal!”

The originally tit for tat situation temporarily calmed down.

Wright, who was upstairs opposite, was looking into the hospital through a telescope. Seeing that Gu Zhou and the President’s expressions had softened, he frowned and muttered to himself.

These two people seemed to have reconciled?

Didn’t the president care about Lina’s life at all?

At the thought of this, Wright’s expression darkened. He said to his assistant, “Did the hospital send a message?”

The assistant had been looking at his cell phone when he heard Wright’s words. He hurriedly handed the phone to him. The conversation between Gu Zhou and the European president was written on the phone.

Wright’s expression darkened. He gripped his cell phone tightly. In his anger, he smashed the phone to the ground.

“The president actually agreed to give Gu Zhou ten hours. Is he crazy? Does he not want his daughter to recover?” Wright said through gritted teeth! Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

When the assistant heard Wright’s words, he stepped forward timidly and said in a low voice, “Prince, don’t be angry. I think Gu Zhou definitely won’t be able to cure the Seventh Princess. You’re the only one who can cure her. They’re just stalling for time. Perhaps Gu Zhou is looking everywhere for the antidote!”
