Qiao Nian pushed open the door of the embroidery room and walked in. She saw two servants cleaning the room.

“Hello, Miss Qiao!”

“Hello, Miss Qiao!”

Qiao Nian said calmly, “Alright, the two of you can get back to work. I’ll be fine alone here.”

When the two servants left, Qiao Nian took out her tablet and continued reading the information she had downloaded.

One of the documents mentioned the trauma of childhood. It would also cause the patient to develop other personalities.

Qiao Nian narrowed her beautiful fox-like eyes.

If Gu Chuan had appeared because of Sugar’s death, then why had Zhou Zhou appeared?

Qiao Nian read the e-book for a while more before closing the tablet, preparing to embroider the blessing bag.

The room was filled with all kinds of luxurious threads, looms, and various types of needles. When Qiao Nian saw these, she sighed helplessly. She was preparing a blessing bag for herself in advance.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on a table not far away. There was a box on the wooden table.

According to the old man of the Lu family, this was the ashes of the severed limbs of the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

After this incident, the corpse of the eldest daughter of the Lu family had never been found. All that was found was her arm.

They wondered how that girl was doing now. This time, they would treat the embroidered blessing bag as a symbol for that girl!

They hoped that that girl could bless them to solve the mystery of her death as soon as possible.

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian frowned. She didn’t know what had happened back then either. Those people were actually willing to kill other children to disguise her death.

If she hadn’t recognized her brother by accident, she might never have known her identity.

If only Grandma Qiao was still alive. Then, she would be able to ask her what had happened back then.

However, that poor girl was treated as cannon fodder.

Qiao Nian sat in front of the embroidery rack. She had already thought of what kind of blessing bag to embroider for that girl, and for herself.

When she went to the Lu family this time, she hoped to find more clues.

At this moment, Lu Qi’s sweet smile flashed across her mind.

Qiao Nian clenched her fists involuntarily. This time, when she went to the Lu family, she would be able to see her family.

Not only would he be able to see Big Brother, but she might also be able to see Second Brother, Third Brother, Lu Qi, and Grandma.

Yongan Building.

Gu Qing’s studio was also in the Yongan Building. Usually, when she was on a business trip, she would get Su Sheng to help her take care of things here.

However, this was her studio after all. As long as she wasn’t on a business trip, she would usually come here to take care of things.

After Gu Qing flew back from overseas, she went to the studio.

She had just walked to the entrance of the studio when she saw Su Sheng chatting happily with Xiao Zhang at the front desk through the glass.

Gu Qing pushed the door open and entered. When Su Sheng saw Gu Qing, her eyes lit up. She walked forward happily. “Senior, did your work go well?”

“It went quite smoothly.” As Gu Qing spoke, she greeted Little Zhang at the front desk and walked towards her office.

Su Sheng hurriedly followed her and said, “Senior, your reputation is getting better and better. The people overseas also believe in your medical skills. It won’t be long before you become the most famous psychiatrist in the world.”

Gu Qing smiled and pushed open the office door. She casually placed her handbag on the shelf.

She walked towards the sofa and heaved a sigh of relief when she sat down.

Su Sheng quickly poured a glass of water for Gu Qing and handed it to her.

“Thank you. By the way, I asked you to visit Qiao Nian’s friend’s child, Gu Qi. How is he?”

When Su Sheng heard Gu Qing’s words, she hesitated for a moment and said, “Senior, I think that child has congenital autism. It’ll probably be very difficult for him to recover.”

When she heard Su Sheng’s words, she frowned. She pursed her lips and remained silent.

Seeing this, Su Sheng asked in confusion, “Senior, what do you think of this matter?”

“Let’s observe for a while longer!” Gu Qing trusted her judgment very much. However, Su Sheng was not weak either. She did not see Gu Qi, so she wanted to wait until she saw Gu Qi.
