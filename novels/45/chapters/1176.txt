1177 Be Good

“Sugar, be good. Don’t cry. Be good. Let’s go home later, okay?” Shen An patted her back gently and coaxed her softly.

Thank you readers!

He had seen Sugar before. She was a happy, lively, and smart little girl. In the end, Sugar was tied up here and was covered in wounds. She was even tortured beyond recognition!

He didn’t even dare to imagine how his cerebral palsy daughter would be tortured now.

“Sugar, don’t cry. Be good!”

“Grandpa Shen, did you specially come to look for me? Are you here to bring me home?” The little girl allowed Shen An to wipe her tears. She looked at Shen An expectantly and asked innocently.

Shen An didn’t dare to look Sugar in the eye. His heart was filled with guilt.

He had also been kidnapped, and he had to extract Sugar’s bone marrow.

Sugar was only three years old. She was so young, but she had to experience the pain of having her bone marrow extracted.

Even adults had to take a huge risk to extract their bone marrow, let alone her, who was only three years old.

But he couldn’t tell Sugar any of this. He was afraid that she wouldn’t be able to persevere. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

He had to do his best to save Sugar’s life and save her. He could not let those people find out!

It seemed that the surgery could only succeed. It could not fail!

This was the only way to save all of them!

That woman was already crazy. She probably only had eyes for her own daughter.

For a moment, he felt that that woman hated the Lu family very much.

Shen An gently wiped the little girl’s face dry and coaxed her gently, “Sugar, I secretly came over myself. I originally wanted to secretly send you home because if you accidentally made a sound when you woke up, the two of us might be discovered by those people. At that time, I would also be arrested by those people. Neither of us would be able to escape!”

When Little Lu Nian heard Grandpa Shen’s words, he nodded seriously and said, “Grandpa, if I cover my mouth, I will be quiet and they won’t hear me. Then, can we go home?”

“But you’re a child. What if you accidentally make a sound? We only have one chance to escape. We can’t waste it!” Shen An said seriously.

Little Lu Nian seemed to understand what Shen An meant. He blinked in confusion and asked, “Grandpa Shen, what should we do now?”

“How about this? I’ll give you an injection first. At that time, you’ll fall asleep. No matter what happens, it won’t wake you up, and you won’t make a sound. Then, I’ll bring you out of here with me, okay?” Shen An asked gently.

“It’ll hurt a little, but don’t be afraid. After the injection, you’ll fall asleep and won’t know anything!”

Little Lu Nian’s beautiful face scrunched up, and her eyes turned red. She said pitifully, “Sugar is really afraid of pain, but in order to go home and see Mom and Dad, I’m willing to get an injection!”

When Shen An heard her soft voice, his heart almost melted into a pool of water. Sugar was really obedient and sensible. No wonder Su Yan always said that she was very cute. Who wouldn’t like such a cute young lady?

“Sugar is so obedient. You’re the bravest young lady in the world!” Shen An patted Sugar’s head and praised her.

When Shen An entered Sugar’s room, he had already gone to the operating theater next door to take a look. There were cameras around the operating theater. It should be to monitor his surgery!

If he wanted to save her, he could only wait until the surgery was over.

He wasn’t sure if that woman would let his daughter off now. The most important thing now was to save as many as possible!

Sugar was still young. Anesthesia would cause a lot of damage to her body, and extracting her bone marrow would also cause a certain amount of damage to her body. However, all of this was to let Sugar live!

After Shen An gave Sugar anesthesia, he waited for Sugar to fall asleep before carrying her to the operating theater next door!
