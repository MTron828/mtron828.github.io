880 Pain

Before Qiao Nian could speak, Xiao Shi hugged her and buried her head in her arms.

She gently patted Xiao Shi’s back and comforted her. “Xiao Shi, don’t be afraid. Auntie Nian Nian is by your side. Auntie Nian Nian will protect you.”

When Xiao Shi heard Qiao Nian’s gentle comforting words, her expression froze for a moment. Thinking of the situation in her dream just now, her tears fell uncontrollably. She cried, “Auntie Nian Nian, I just dreamed that my mommy…”

Before she could finish speaking, the memories from before instantly surged back.

!!

Just now, Song Man carried her to the window and was about to jump down with her. She still remembered the feeling of her feet hanging in the air and her body about to fall. She still remembered Song Man pushing her back into the room. She still remembered her father pulling her back from death. She still remembered the warm smile Song Man gave her when she fell.

Xiao Shi cried silently, her lips trembling.

So Mommy was really gone!

Mommy had really jumped off a building!

Xiao Shi’s heart seemed to be clenched tightly, and it hurt terribly.

Qiao Nian looked down at Xiao Shi, who was in her arms. Her figure was so weak and helpless. She couldn’t help but hug Xiao Shi tightly. She rested her head on Xiao Shi’s head and comforted her. “Xiao Shi, don’t be sad. Everyone has their own choice. She chose to leave, so we should respect her choice.”

At this point, Qiao Nian paused for a moment and continued, “As for your mommy, I think… we should be able to find out more about her when we investigate her in the future.”

“Mommy?” Xiao Shi repeated, muttering.

From the moment she could remember, she had lived with Song Man.

Most of her memories were of Song Man. Even though Song Man said that she was not her mommy, every time someone mentioned “Mommy”, she could not help but think of Song Man.

At the thought of Song Man, Xiao Shi recalled that Song Man had insisted on jumping off a building. She couldn’t help but cry and shake her head sadly. “Xiao Shi don’t want Mommy anymore. Mommy doesn’t want me anymore…”

Qiao Nian’s heart ached as she hugged Xiao Shi tightly. After all, Xiao Shi was just a child. She must have been terrified to encounter such a big thing.

She sighed softly. It seemed that Xiao Shi would not be able to accept anyone as a mother for a while. Xiao Shi would be afraid of the person who became her mother.

This was because the trauma Song Man had left in Xiao Shi was too great.

She knew all too well.

Once bitten, twice shy.

Perhaps only time could heal these injuries. Qiao Nian knew this too well, because she had slowly walked out of it like this in the past. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

She suddenly recalled what her brother had said when she reunited with him. It was only then that she felt that she had found her home.

“Xiao Shi, the person who really loves you will only love you and never hurt you. Now that you’ve found your family, you’ll be happy in the future. You’ll get over it.”

“No, no, no. Xiao Shi will always be alone. Without Mommy, no one will love Xiao Shi…”

When Qiao Nian heard Xiao Shi’s words, she understood that Xiao Shi had fallen into a strange circle of self-doubt because of Song Man’s deficiencies.

“Xiao Shi, actually, you can…”

Before Qiao Nian could finish speaking, she stopped.

In the past, when she was sent to the countryside by Su Xue, she was in self-doubt every day. Every day, she thought about getting better. That way, she could be brought home.

At that time, she guarded the door every day, waiting for the Qiao family to pick her up. However, after waiting for a long time, no one came to visit her, let alone pick her up.

At that time, many friends comforted her, but she couldn’t listen. No one else understood this matter, and no one could understand her thoughts.

No one could empathize with and understand the pain and sadness of others.

Qiao Nian sighed helplessly. At the age of six, she had been in great pain when she was sent to the countryside. At the age of five, not only did Xiao Shi have to accept that the woman who had raised her for five years was not her biological mother, but she had to accept that Song Man had personally jumped off a building in front of her. She also had to accept that Song Man was only using her.

Qiao Nian really couldn’t empathize. Just thinking about it made her feel so sad.
