1412 Confession

Qin Chuan looked at Lu Qi’s small face and recalled his rash words previously. He said, “I’m sorry for offending you with my words.”

Lu Qi’s hand, which was holding the bowl, trembled slightly, but she quickly regained her composure. She placed the bowl on the table in front of her and hesitated about what to say.

“Actually, yesterday…”

Chen Qing placed the dishes on the table responsibly.

“Miss Lu, I think I must like you very much!” Qin Chuan’s voice was low and mellow as he looked at Lu Qi, who was sitting opposite him.

Chen Qing happened to place the last small dish on the table. He was slightly stunned. Was this something that he should be listening to?

From the corner of his eye, Chen Qing glanced at Qin Chuan. The love in Qin Chuan’s eyes was about to overflow. He glanced at Lu Qi, who was not far away. Lu Qi’s face was red, and she was stunned on the spot.

He steadied his expression and tried his best to become invisible. He left silently, not forgetting to close the door.

At this moment, only Qin Chuan and Lu Qi were left in the room.

Lu Qi looked at Qin Chuan in shock. She had never expected Qin Chuan to say such a thing. She stood rooted to the ground in shock.

“I’m telling the truth.” Qin Chuan looked at Lu Qi sincerely and said in a low voice, “I’m just showing you my feelings.”

When Lu Qi heard Qin Chuan’s words, she was slightly stunned. She lowered her gaze and thought for a long time. Instead of answering Qin Chuan directly, she asked, “I heard that you lost your memory?”

“Yes,” Qin Chuan said.

Lu Qi’s eyes were filled with sorrow. She looked at Qin Chuan and said, “I’m sorry, Senior Brother. It’s all my fault for harming you. If it weren’t for me, you wouldn’t have been injured, and you wouldn’t have lost your memory. I wonder if there will be any aftereffects of your illness…”

Towards the end, Lu Qi’s eyes were filled with tears. She sniffled and was about to speak when Qin Chuan spoke first.

“My amnesia is temporary.” Qin Chuan looked at Lu Qi gently, as if he was trying hard to comfort her. “I don’t know if there will be any aftereffects of my amnesia, but I know one thing very well. If you’re injured, I’ll feel even worse. I’ll only be at ease when I know that you’re safe.”

Hearing Qin Chuan’s words, Lu Qi’s heart stopped beating. She stared unblinkingly at Qin Chuan, tears blurring her vision.

Qin Chuan reached out and patted Lu Qi’s head, coaxing gently, “Don’t cry!”

In order to save her, Qin Chuan pounced on her without hesitation and blocked the huge rock for her. Tears fell uncontrollably.

Seeing her cry, Qin Chuan felt as if a huge rock was pressing down on his chest. He felt so uncomfortable that he couldn’t breathe. He picked up a tissue and carefully wiped Lu Qi’s tears. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Be good and stop crying. If you continue crying, you’ll become a rabbit,” Qin Chuan advised gently.

Lu Qi’s body stiffened. She looked at Qin Chuan in surprise, her eyes filled with gratitude for him.

What did she do to make him, who had lost his memory, remember to protect her?

Lu Qi pursed her lips and said gratefully, “Thank you. Thank you for protecting me previously, Senior Brother.”

When Qin Chuan heard the words “Senior Brother”, he felt a sense of familiarity. He felt very close to her, as if they had always interacted like this.

Qin Chuan retracted his hand and smiled. “I’m your senior brother. We’re family. There’s no need to thank me.”

I hope you can become Mrs. Qin soon.

Of course, Qin Chuan didn’t dare to say this. He was worried that Lu Qi would be frightened.

When Lu Qi heard the word “family”, she recalled what Qin Chuan had said at night about the two of them being husband and wife. She couldn’t help but blush.

Qin Chuan held Lu Qi’s hand.

Lu Qi’s heart was in her throat. She looked at Qin Chuan shyly and in confusion.

“Qi Qi, I really like you. I’m not joking.”

Lu Qi felt her heart beating violently, as if it was about to jump out of her chest. Her mind seemed to have crashed, and she could not think at all.

She just didn’t understand why Qin Chuan liked her. They had only met three times.

She didn’t believe in love at first sight.
