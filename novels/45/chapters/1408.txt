1409 Apologizing

Auntie Cao had been extremely sad, but now that she heard the conversation between Qiao Nian and Uncle Zhao, she seemed to have realized something. She slowly stood up and looked at Qiao Nian beside her. Her voice trembled as she asked, “Miss, are you saying that Old Zhao was hypnotized and his memories were tampered with? Is that why he did such a stupid thing?”

Auntie Cao’s words were very ingenious. There were two layers of meaning.

On the first layer, she meant Uncle Zhao had done something wrong, but that wasn’t his intention. He had been harmed.

On the second layer, Auntie Cao was saying that Uncle Zhao had been deceived into doing something wrong. Now, Uncle Zhao was like a puppet. A puppet wasn’t in the wrong, right? Otherwise, she wouldn’t have said that Uncle Zhao had schemed to kill Lu Qi!

Auntie Cao wanted to get Uncle Zhao out of this matter.

Qiao Nian gave Auntie Cao a meaningful look. She didn’t speak. Her gaze fell on Uncle Zhao’s face not far away and she asked calmly, “Uncle Zhao, think about it. Who gave you that note? What was the name on it?”

Uncle Zhao shook his head gently and looked at Matriarch Lu not far away with red-rimmed eyes. In a daze, he seemed to see Old Master Lu sitting beside Matriarch Lu. Tears of regret fell. “Mr. Lu, it’s all my fault. I’ve let you down…”

Uncle Zhao struggled to stand up and apologize, but he was tied up tightly and couldn’t move at all.

The more he struggled, the deeper the rope dug into his body. He looked at Matriarch Lu with red-rimmed eyes and said in a choked voice, “It’s my fault. There’s something wrong with my brain. Matriarch, it’s all my fault. I almost killed Young Madam. I don’t know who gave me the note, let alone who hypnotized me. I…”

“Ah!” Uncle Zhao screamed hysterically.

Qiao Nian noticed that the silver needles she had used to trap the hypnotic worm had fallen off at some point. Her expression changed and she immediately inserted a few needles into Uncle Zhao’s brain. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Uncle Zhao fainted. Everyone could clearly see a piece of skin bulging on his bare upper body. The thing under his skin was still moving around.

Everyone’s expression changed drastically. They looked at the squirming worm in Uncle Zhao’s body in fear.

Matriarch Lu looked at Uncle Zhao, who had fainted in pain. She was a little shocked.

When Old Master was young, Uncle Zhao had been by his side and accompanied the Lu family through storms. Back then, when Old Master left, it was Uncle Zhao who helped her protect the Lu family business.

Matriarch Lu had never doubted Uncle Zhao’s loyalty. This time, even if Uncle Zhao had betrayed the Lu family, this was not his intention.

Matriarch Lu closed her eyes in exhaustion. She didn’t know who the person behind this was, but the only thing she knew clearly was that those people would never let the Lu family off!

Matriarch Lu sighed helplessly and said in a low voice, “Let Old Zhao return to his room to rest first!”

When Auntie Cao heard Matriarch Gu’s words, she hurriedly cried and apologized. “Thank you, Matriarch Gu. Thank you for your understanding!”

Auntie Cao hurriedly called the servants in and they brought Uncle Zhao away.

Auntie Cao was very worried about Uncle Zhao’s condition, but when she thought about how Qiao Nian might tell everyone about Uncle Zhao’s current health, she stayed.

In the living room, everyone’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face.

Auntie Cao tiptoed to the side and stood there, staring unblinkingly at Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian frowned slightly. After a long while, she said, “Uncle Zhao’s condition is very troublesome now.”

When Auntie Cao heard Qiao Nian’s words, her heart jumped to her throat. She clenched her fists tightly, trying hard to control herself.

“What’s going on?” Matriarch Lu said with a frown. She was still very concerned about Uncle Zhao.

“I can’t expel the hypnotic worm in his body now. Moreover, when he wakes up again, if I don’t suppress the hypnotic worm in him, his memories will be sealed again. He will only remember that the Lu family has let him down!” Qiao Nian said thoughtfully, frowning.

“How could this be?” Auntie Cao said in disbelief. Her voice trembled slightly, and there were tears in her eyes. “Eldest Miss, I know that your medical skills are brilliant. Can you think of a way to get rid of the Hypnotic worm in his body?”
