Gu Zhou walked over to Qiao Nian and draped a fur coat over her.

Actually, Qiao Nian wasn’t cold. She wanted to take off her cloak, but she received a burning gaze from the man. There was a trace of danger and warning in his eyes.

Qiao Nian lowered her hand silently.

Gu Zhou held Qiao Nian’s right hand and walked beside her. “I’ll take you somewhere.”

Although not many people came to this villa, the servants still cleaned it regularly every day. However, the lights would not be left on.

The villa grew darker and darker. Moonlight and starlight could no longer be seen.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips and said hesitantly, “Can we turn on the lights?”

That night five years ago was like a chain that had been locked around her, preventing her from breaking free.

Her footsteps gradually slowed down.

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s voice, he stopped in his tracks. He realized that she seemed to be especially afraid of the dark. At this moment, Qiao Nian looked like an ordinary girl.

Qiao Nian sensed that Gu Zhou had stopped. In the darkness, she could only see the outline of Gu Zhou’s face. She narrowed her eyes, trying to get a better look. “Why aren’t you walking?”

Qiao Nian just wanted Gu Zhou to turn on the power for her. She didn’t want to stay in the dark anymore. Seeing that Gu Zhou didn’t speak, her heart was in a mess. Puzzled, she asked, “Why aren’t you saying anything? Are you feeling unwell? Ah…”

Before she could finish speaking, her waist was trapped in his arms, and her feet left the ground. Only then did she realize that Gu Zhou had picked her up.

In the darkness, except for her vision, all her senses were magnified.

She let out a cry of surprise and instinctively wrapped her arms around Gu Zhou’s neck, leaning her head against his chest.

The tip of her nose was sniffing the man’s scent. For some reason, she felt at ease.

Qiao Nian felt extremely uncomfortable being carried like a princess by Gu Zhou. She licked her lips gently and said in a low voice, “I can walk.”

“We’re almost there. If you’re afraid, close your eyes.”

Gu Zhou’s voice was low, hoarse, and pleasant to the ear, but there was an undeniable quality to it.

Qiao Nian sighed silently in her heart. She leaned her head against his chest and closed her eyes silently.

She could clearly hear the strong heartbeat in his chest. For some reason, her heart suddenly began to race, making her feel flustered.

She tried hard to adjust her mentality. At this moment, she was being carried in his arms like a toy.

When Gu Zhou wasn’t sick, he was quite the boyfriend.

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze. If he wasn’t sick, would their paths have never crossed?

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian immediately threw all the strange thoughts in her mind to the back of her mind.

Even if Gu Zhou’s life changed, the butterfly effect would not affect her. She would still be the second daughter of the Qiao family, who was not favored by anyone.

Moreover, she still had to look for her grandfather. Her grandfather had raised her painstakingly, but he had disappeared for no reason.

Thinking of her grandfather, Qiao Nian’s heart gradually calmed down. Her thoughts gradually drifted away.

When Qiao Nian sat down on the swing with Gu Zhou in her arms, she came back to her senses and realized that this was a small garden behind the villa.

This small garden was at the top of the mountain. It was sealed off with glass.

Sitting on the swing, she saw the bustling An City. The neon lights of the night flickered, and the traffic was heavy.

Moonlight and starlight scattered on the ground, making one feel very comfortable.

The fear and insecurity in Qiao Nian’s heart dissipated. It was as if a person who had lost her way in the darkness had seen a ray of light and was saved.

Gu Zhou sat not far away from Qiao Nian. He glanced at her and asked, “Are you still feeling cold?”

The temperature at the top of the mountain was slightly lower than at the bottom.
