1268 Sacrificing Him

Xiao Shi instantly recalled this. Previously, she had heard from her brother that the first time her brother and Mommy met was outside the funeral parlor. At that time, her brother had asked Mommy for money.

At that time, his brother didn’t have any money. His brother could only think of being a playmate to earn money and still owe his mother a huge sum of money. He couldn’t forget it and earned money from it.

“I remember now. So she’s Brother’s sugar daddy!” Xiao Shi said with a smile.

“Yeah.”

“She knows Baby Xiao Bao. Baby Xiao Bao hasn’t played many games. In that case, Baby Xiao Bao shouldn’t be a bad person!” Xiao Shi analyzed it seriously.

When Gu Qi heard Xiao Shi’s words, he nodded slightly. He felt that Xiao Shi was right, but he also felt that there was something wrong that he couldn’t put his finger on.

Was Baby Xiao Bao a good person?

…

Xiao Bao looked at the team lineup, his eyes sparkling. He hurriedly raised his phone to Chang Feng and said excitedly, “Uncle Feng, look!”

When Chang Feng heard Xiao Bao’s words, he glanced at his phone screen and asked in confusion, “What are you looking at?”

Xiao Bao’s fingers slid across “Mr. Q” and “Shi Shi”. He said excitedly, “See!”

“Are they Gu Qi and Xiao Shi?” Only then did Chang Feng notice the two accounts Xiao Bao was pointing at. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Xiao Bao nodded repeatedly like a chicken eating rice. He said excitedly, “Yes, Mommy invited Brother and Sister to play games with me. Oh my god, I can actually play games with my family.”

Xiao Bao gave a happy smile and looked at Chang Feng happily. “Uncle Feng, I…”

However, before Xiao Bao could finish speaking, he was interrupted by Chang Feng. “The game has begun. If you don’t go out soon, you’ll lose again!”

“Ah!” Xiao Bao hurriedly bought the equipment and controlled the little avatar with his left hand to walk out. His face was filled with seriousness. “I don’t want to drag Mommy back. I must let Mommy win!”

Seeing Xiao Bao like this, Chang Feng couldn’t help but smile.

Xiao Bao was a support player. Seeing that Qiao Nian was a marksman, he happily controlled his hero to dance beside Qiao Nian’s hero and muttered. “The battle hasn’t started yet. I’m going to get serious later!”

Qiao Nian was about to fight the wave when she saw “Baby Xiao Bao” dancing. She looked at the hero in disbelief.

She really hadn’t expected Eldest Senior Brother to be so cute. Hence, she controlled her hero to jump up.

There were five games in a row. When their teammates saw that the four of them were dancing, they directly moved the heroes to dance together.

In order not to be disturbed, the five of them danced beside the crystal and seemed to be lost in the moment.

A text message from an unfamiliar teammate, Bee, appeared on the screen. “Mr. Q, it’s my honor to be in a team with you to play games!”

After Bee sent the message, she saw that the other party was still dancing. She didn’t care much. With the first place in the national server, there was nothing to worry about in such a sure-win situation.

The group danced for five minutes. Then, everyone returned to their respective lines and began to get serious.

At this moment, the game announcement began.

First Blood!

Everyone saw “Baby Xiao Bao” lying enchantingly in the middle of the development road.

Qiao Nian stood under the tower and looked at the hero lying dead in the middle of the road. She hesitated for a moment, but couldn’t help but send a message.

“Eldest Senior Brother? You’re simply too amazing. Are you a professional at giving first blood?”

Xiao Bao looked at the message his mommy had sent and looked at Chang Feng pitifully. “Uncle Feng, Mommy is speechless and is starting to speak sarcastically!”

“Yeah.”

Just as Xiao Bao was about to say something, Chang Feng said, “You’re alive now. Hurry up and protect your mommy!”

“Oh,” Xiao Bao replied. He controlled his hero to run towards his mommy, his mind filled with his mommy’s appearance.

He ran to his mommy and specially created a tank suit to help her block all the damage. His heart was filled with pride and satisfaction.

Not only could he protect his mommy in reality, but he could also protect her online!

He died more and more times and lost sixteen lives!
