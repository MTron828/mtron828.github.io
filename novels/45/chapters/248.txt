Chapter 249: Surprise!

Brother Cao’s gaze fell on Xia Xue’s face. Since Xia Xue could play such a difficult song, she should be quite capable.

Xia Xue felt her scalp go numb under Brother Cao’s gaze. A chill ran down her spine.

Didn’t Brother Cao want her to debut?

Why did Brother Cao say, “How can this be?” Was Brother Cao in a hurry?

Had Brother Cao never thought of letting her debut?

Xia Xue’s heart suddenly began to race.

Brother Cao also knew that he had acted too rashly. A kind smile appeared on his face as he continued, “Miss Xia, I know that your arm isn’t feeling well, but my requirements aren’t high. You just have to play a little.”

Xia Xue looked at Brother Cao in embarrassment and bit her lip. After a long while, she said carefully, “But my arm is really uncomfortable. If you really want to hear it, I can do it for you all day after my arm recovers.”

What Xia Xue lacked now was time. If she could have a day or two of buffer time, she felt that she would definitely be able to meet Brother Cao’s requirements. It would be fine even if her hands were crippled for the next few days.

However, she really couldn’t play the song properly now.

When Brother Cao heard Xia Xue’s words, he couldn’t help but have a headache. He saw that there didn’t seem to be anything wrong with the young lady’s arm but after hearing her, why did he feel that this young lady’s arm was about to be crippled?

Just as Brother Cao was at a loss as to what to do, Dong Hua’s voice suddenly sounded in his earpiece. “Tell her the truth.”

Brother Cao heaved a sigh of relief. If Dong Hua said so, then things would be easier to handle. He looked at Xia Xue with a serious expression and said, “Miss Xia, since things have come to this, I have no choice but to tell you everything. The thing is, Mr. Dong Hua’s concert will be held in two days. Everyone knows that Mr. Dong Hua is a person who pursues perfection, but there’s a female musician in the concert. She suddenly had something on and couldn’t be present. Therefore, we need a female musician with an excellent image and temperament to take over her job. This is a challenge and an opportunity for you. If you can seize this opportunity, I believe your future will definitely be bright.”

When Gao Lin, who was standing in the corner, heard Brother Cao’s words, her jaw dropped. She covered her mouth tightly with both hands, afraid that she would scream in excitement.

Oh my god!

Sister Xia Xue was going to accompany Mr. Dong Hua.

This was a great honor!

Gao Lin’s eyes were red with excitement. She stared unblinkingly at Xia Xue, eager for her to agree.

At this moment, Xia Xue was also stunned. Her worry had already jumped to her throat. She looked at Brother Cao in confusion. She felt that happiness had arrived too suddenly.

Xia Xue was overjoyed.

She was a little jealous of the girl who had been practicing the violin here yesterday. That girl was actually valued by Brother Cao.

However, that girl was unlucky. She was about to replace that girl.

If she could be a female musician for Mr. Dong Hua, would she be able to debut on the spot?

She could not let go of such a good opportunity. She had to grasp it tightly.

With this thought in mind, Xia Xue said considerately, “Why don’t I just play a short segment?”

“Alright, alright. Just a short one,” Brother Cao said eagerly.

Gao Lin, who was standing at the side, picked up a violin with great foresight and handed it to Xia Xue. Then, she stood aside with a smile.

Xia Xue stood up with the violin in her hand. She placed it on her shoulder and gently closed her eyes. She thought about the music she had practiced and found some feeling in her heart before she began to play. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The beautiful music was mixed with a strong sense of longing. Brother Cao closed his eyes slightly. As he listened to the music, he couldn’t help but frown, as if he was thinking of the person he had missed.
