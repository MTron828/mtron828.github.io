Chapter 385: The Truth

Li Kun knew that Qin Lu was hiding something. He said coldly, “Hurry up and apologize to Miss Jiang and Miss Qiao!”

Seeing that her cousin did not believe her, Qin Lu wailed aggrievedly, “Cousin, it really wasn’t me…”

“Shut up and apologize quickly!” Li Kun interrupted Qin Lu.

Gu Zhou stood at the side, his eyes turning cold. His thin lips parted slightly as he said, “Mr. Li, Jiang Yue and Qiao Nian are both staying at my house now. In that case, why don’t you hand Qin Lu over to me to deal with?”

Gu Zhou was not negotiating with Li Kun but informing him.

At this moment, Qin Lu panicked even more. She cried and shook her head, crawling to Li Kun on her knees. “Cousin, I’ve really never harmed you and Miss Qiao. If I did, I would have been struck by lightning. I beg you, please don’t hand me over to him!”

Although Li Kun did not like Qin Lu, she was his biological cousin after all. Moreover, Qin Lu’s mother had saved his mother back then.

If he handed Qin Lu over to Gu Zhou just like that, Qin Lu would probably die a terrible death.

However, the Li family and the Fu family could not compete in status.

Li Kun frowned. His gaze landed on Gu Zhou’s face and he said tentatively, “Young Master Gu, Qin Lu has indeed made a mistake this time. However, can you let her off easy?”

Seeing that Gu Zhou was expressionless, Li Kun’s gaze landed on Qin Lu’s face and he reprimanded sternly, “Hurry up and apologize to them!”

Qin Lu instantly understood what Li Kun meant. She knelt in front of Qiao Nian and Jiang Yue, kowtowing hard and apologizing profusely.

Seeing that Gu Zhou still had no intention of letting Qin Lu off, Li Kun’s gaze landed on Qiao Nian’s face. He said, “Miss Qiao, Qin Lu is also muddle-headed. Moreover, she has paid the price for this matter. I wonder if you can spare her life?”

......

Hearing Li Kun’s words, Qiao Nian smiled and said, “Young Master Li, you’re being too serious. The Gu family isn’t a triad. How could they possibly take someone’s life?”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words and seeing that Gu Zhou did not retort, Li Kun secretly heaved a sigh of relief. Then, he said, “Young Master Gu, let’s settle this matter here. There’s no need to bring her to your house.”

“Ok.”

Gu Zhou finally relented.

Gu Zhou brought Qin Lu into the room and closed the door. Everyone else stayed outside.

Qiao Nian’s gaze landed on Jiang Yue’s face. She smiled and said, “Jiang Yue, this is a good move, but the person you found is a little too stupid.”

The smile on Jiang Yue’s face did not change. She said, “What are you talking about? Why don’t I understand?”

“Aphrodisiac powder. The drug in the tea is a controlled drug in the country. Ordinary people won’t be able to get it. How can someone as incompetent as Qin Lu get such a drug?” Qiao Nian smiled gently.

.

“Really? I don’t know about that.” Jiang Yue was still smiling, but there was a hint of panic in her heart. She hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to know what was in the tea just by smelling it.

“Of course you can get it. You’re from the medical school,” Qiao Nian said calmly.

The smile on Jiang Yue’s face turned cold. “Do you have any evidence?” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I don’t have any evidence, but I know that he knows it’s you.” Qiao Nian smiled brightly.

Jiang Yue’s body swayed.

Li Kun, who was standing not far away, looked at the closed door worriedly. He did not know what Gu Zhou would do to Qin Lu.

In the room, Qin Lu knelt in front of Gu Zhou and kept kowtowing. “I’m sorry, I’m really sorry. I really didn’t drug you. I…”

“I know you didn’t drug her.” Gu Zhou interrupted Qin Lu.

Qin Lu stopped kowtowing and looked at Gu Zhou in surprise.
