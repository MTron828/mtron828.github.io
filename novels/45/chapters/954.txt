The doctor and nurse pushed the hospital bed in from outside. Together, they worked hard to get Qiao Shan onto the bed. Then, they pushed the hospital bed towards the operating theater.

Qiao Yu turned around and glanced at Su Xue and Qiao Xin, who were still standing there. It was as if this was the first time he had seen them. He retracted his gaze and followed the doctor without hesitation.

Su Xue and Qiao Xin were left alone in the ward.

Qiao Xin recalled Qiao Yu’s departing gaze and couldn’t help but shiver. Her heart was in a mess, and she gripped Su Xue’s hand tightly in fear. She asked, “Mom, do you think Dad’s leg will recover?”

!!

Su Xue’s heart was also in a mess. She gently patted Qiao Xin’s hand and comforted her. “Don’t worry, it’ll be fine. You have to take good care of yourself now. Mom will be here for everything else. Be good!”

Hearing Su Xue’s words, Qiao Xin’s eyes turned red.

She had always been Qiao Shan’s pride, but what she had done today had disappointed her father. Perhaps her father would bear a grudge against her in the future.

“Mom, I’m scared.” Qiao Xin looked at Su Xue in pain and unease.

“It’s fine. It’s in the past. Don’t worry.” Su Xue comforted her gently. Seeing that Qiao Xin was still terrified, she said, “Your father dotes on you the most. How can he blame you?”

“Will dad really not blame me?” Qiao Xin looked at Su Xue with teary eyes, her voice trembling. “It was me. I hit him the first time. I didn’t use much strength. I just wanted to put on an act…”

Seeing Qiao Xin’s terrified expression, Su Xue pulled Qiao Xin into her arms and gently patted her back. “As parents, we care about our children the most. As long as our children are fine, we can do anything. Your father definitely won’t be angry with you, nor will he blame you. He just wants you to live a better life!”

Qiao Xin sniffled. At that time, she really had no other choice.

Letting her father become disabled was the best choice.

Moreover, she would take good care of her father in the future to make up for her mistake today.

Hearing Qiao Xin’s aggrieved cries, Su Xue continued, “Even if I were the one here today, I would still choose to do the same. I would rather suffer myself than let you suffer because you’re our most precious child.”

Qiao Xin pushed Su Xue away and asked uneasily, “Really?”

Qiao Xin still remembered when Chen Qing had hit Qiao Shan’s leg. At that time, her father had looked at her with not only shock and astonishment, but also sadness…

Why had her father looked at her back then?

Qiao Xin was still trying to recall what had just happened when Su Xue gripped her hand tightly, interrupting her thoughts.

“Don’t worry, I’ll take good care of your father and put in a good word for you. When that happens, you’ll be fine!” Su Xue said gently.

Qiao Xin thought about it and agreed. Her father liked her a lot. He definitely couldn’t bear for her to suffer.

However, something was wrong with her brother’s appearance when he walked out just now.

Qiao Xin looked up at Su Xue and asked carefully, “Mom, I think Brother is different from before. He seems to hate me very much now. I…”

“You’re biological siblings. There’s no overnight feud between siblings. Besides, it’s not like you don’t know how much your brother usually dotes on you. He’s just angry now. When he stops being angry, it’ll be fine.”

When Qiao Xin heard Su Xue’s words, she nodded in agreement.

Her brother had doted on her for more than twenty years. How could he not like her in an instant?

Seeing that Qiao Xin had calmed down, Su Xue recalled Qiao Shan, who had just been taken away. She frowned and said, “Alright, rest well now. Your father is in the operating theater now. I have to go and watch over him.”

“Yes.” Qiao Xin nodded.

Su Xue helped Qiao Xin onto the bed and covered her with the blanket before turning to walk out.

When Su Xue turned around, her expression instantly changed, and she felt uneasy.

Just now, Qiao Xin had told her what had happened. When she heard Qiao Xin hit Qiao Shan’s leg with a baseball bat, her heart turned cold.

What if she was the one there?

Would Qiao Xin hit her leg without hesitation and ask Gu Zhou to cripple it?
