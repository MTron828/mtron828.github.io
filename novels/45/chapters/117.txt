Qiao Nian placed her hand on the glass cabinet and gently tapped twice with his fingers. Her gaze fell on the Suranne Grass she had meticulously taken care of, now enclosed in a display cabinet. Coldly, she snorted.

Her gaze swept across the people who were looking at her with disdain. Her eyes were as cold as ice, and the oppressive aura she exuded stunned everyone. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Su Yan looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief. He hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to be so imposing. Her aura was unbelievably strong.

Qiao Nian’s gaze finally fell on Qiao Xin’s face. She raised her eyebrows slightly, her eyes filled with cold arrogance. She said disdainfully, “You think you can afford my Suranne Grass?”

The surroundings instantly went silent. Everyone’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face.

Su Yan drew a sharp breath and frowned, looking at Qiao Xin in confusion.

Qiao Xin’s palms were covered in cold sweat. She looked at Qiao Nian, her face pale, not daring to speak.

At this moment, the old man from before asked, “Young lady, are you saying this pot of Suranne Grass belongs to you?”

“Yes!” Qiao Nian nodded without hesitation, her voice firm.

Everyone around them was stunned!

“How is this possible?”

“Is this because she saw everyone praising Qiao Xin? Is that why she’s trying to draw attention to herself?”

“Definitely. Miss Qiao Xin clearly knows how to cultivate Suranne Grass!”

When Qiao Xin heard these words, her lips curved up involuntarily. She immediately adjusted her mentality, and a warm and sweet smile appeared on her face. “Sister, this is a public place. Stop joking around!”

Hearing Qiao Xin address that young lady as “Sister”, everyone was stunned.

Some of the people in the crowd were on good terms with the Qiao family, so they explained to everyone, “Qiao Shan has two daughters. Qiao Nian, who’s mentally ill, married Second Young Master Gu! The other

daughter is Qiao Xin!”

“So she’s Second Young Master Gu’s wife!”

“She’s not bad-looking, and her outfit looks good as well. What a pity that she’s a lunatic!”

Su Yan, who was standing beside Qiao Xin, seemed to have been struck by lightning. He looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief.

Qiao Nian had actually married Gu Zhou. How was this possible?

He would rather believe that the sun rose in the west.

Su Yan’s gaze lingered on Qiao Nian’s and Gu Zhou’s faces. The two of them didn’t seem to be on good terms. Perhaps Qiao Nian hadn’t really married Gu Zhou.

Hearing everyone’s words, Qiao Xin’s eyes lit up. Smiling, she spoke up for herself. “Sister, if you’re not feeling well, don’t come out into the city for now. Recuperating at home should be the most important thing!”

Qiao Xin’s words confirmed the rumors that Qiao Nian was mentally ill.

Everyone’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. They all felt that the words of a mentally ill patient could not be trusted.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Qiao Xin’s face. She knocked lightly on the glass cabinet containing the Suranne Grass and said calmly, “Qiao Xin, if you don’t let the Suranne Grass out for a breather, it might wither.”

The smile on Qiao Xin’s face grew gentler. Her words were dripping with love and concern. “Sister, did you come out of the house by yourself? Did the nanny who’s taking care of you come with you? Did you take any

medicine this morning?”

“Qiao Xin, I’m not ill. Why would I take any medicine?” Qiao Nian said expressionlessly.

Qiao Xin had initially wanted Gu Zhou to take Qiao Nian away. She looked at Gu Zhou, instantly meeting his dark eyes. Her heart skipped a beat.

Although Qiao Xin had already made up her mind to marry Su Yan, if she had the chance to marry Gu Zhou, she would still choose to marry Gu Zhou instead.

The Gu family was so rich that their wealth could rival a small country. They were much richer than the Su family!

Moreover, Gu Zhou was much more good-looking than Su Yan. In the past, everyone used to say that Gu Zhou would die young, but she felt that perhaps Gu Zhou’s health was just a little weak. She was sure that he

would be fine.

Qiao Xin looked up slightly. Seeing that Gu Zhou was still looking at her, she was overjoyed. Gu Zhou must have taken a liking to her..
