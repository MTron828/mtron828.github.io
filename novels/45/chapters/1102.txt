1103 Disguising a Difficult Childbirth

When Gu Zhou heard Qin Chuan’s words, a trace of worry flashed in his eyes.

He had seen his brother’s bodyguards in MY previously, but he wasn’t sure if his brother was still alive.

If Big Brother was still alive, why hadn’t he returned home?

Gu Zhou was most worried that his eldest brother might be gone.

Gu Zhou sighed heavily, his expression turning even more serious.

“No news is good news.” Qiao Nian held Gu Zhou’s hand tightly and said gently.

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he nodded in agreement.

Qiao Nian looked up at Qin Chuan and deliberately changed the topic. “Old Qin, at that time, I wasn’t in good spirits after giving birth. You were the one who helped me with the funeral of those two poor children.”

Gu Zhou’s attention was all on the children, and he stared unblinkingly at Qin Chuan.

Qin Chuan frowned and took a sip of coffee. “I really didn’t expect those two children to not be yours.”

Gu Zhou pondered for a moment and asked the most important question. “How did the two children die?”

There were many reasons why babies died as soon as they were born. Some were unable to adapt to the outside world, some were no longer breathing when they were born, and some…

When Gu Zhou came to the cafe, he had also asked Qiao Nian this question.

Although Qiao Nian recalled many memories, her memories of giving birth were still unclear, let alone how the two children had died.

In Gu Zhou’s opinion, although Qin Chuan had not inherited Old Master Qin’s medical skills, he should more or less know a little about medicine.

Gu Zhou asked this because he wanted to find out how the two dead babies had died.

Qin Chuan sighed heavily and said, “At that time, I checked the condition of the two babies and realized that they couldn’t breathe normally because of the amniotic fluid. They died from lack of oxygen. Many babies of women who had difficult labor would die because of this.”

When Qiao Nian heard Qin Chuan’s words and combined them with the information she had found, her frown deepened.

This matter was truly flawless. If she hadn’t inadvertently married into the Gu family, she wouldn’t have known for the rest of her life that her children were still alive.

Gu Zhou’s expression grew more and more serious. He said thoughtfully, “What a coincidence. When Nian’er gave birth, other pregnant women gave birth to dead babies because of difficulties. It’s impossible for there to be so many coincidences in this world. All coincidences should have been planned by someone with ulterior motives.”

Qin Chuan nodded and said in agreement, “If I’m not wrong, that person wanted to disguise a fake as the real deal. He wanted to get Sister Nian’s children. Actually, it’s possible to disguise a difficult childbirth.”

Qiao Nian frowned and nodded. She said heavily, “Yes, difficult labor can be disguised. For example, the mother could have had pregnancy poisoning, high blood pressure, an aged placenta or an umbilical cord around the neck of the fetus. When the fetus lacks oxygen, there are many ways to fake difficult labor. Many factors can cause amniotic fluid to be inhaled into the respiratory tract and lungs.”

“Yes.” Qin Chuan frowned and sighed helplessly. “In order to replace Sister Nian’s children, they sacrificed the lives of two children.”

Qin Chuan paused for a moment and continued, “I’m not sure if those two children had the same mother or two different mothers. If the adults died in childbirth, those people were very vicious! This is bascially murder!”

As soon as Qin Chuan finished speaking, the private room fell silent.

Those people had done such heartless things. They must have set up a very big scheme.

Qiao Nian felt especially terrible now. She still vaguely remembered the despair after giving birth. She had been in good health back then, so she was still alive.

She still remembered what Gu Zhou had said about Wang Lin. After Wang Lin gave birth, she was lying on the operating table covered in blood.

She remembered that Wang Lin had died in childbirth. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

An idea flashed across Qiao Nian’s mind. She suddenly looked up at Gu Zhou and said eagerly, “I remember now. Wang Lin gave birth on the same day as me, but she died in childbirth!”

Gu Zhou nodded.

“In other words, Wang Lin was really pregnant at that time. The children on her operating bed were my children. Then where did her children go?” Qiao Nian asked.

Gu Zhou frowned and quickly understood what Qiao Nian meant. “Are you saying that one or both of the dead babies might belong to Wang Lin?”
