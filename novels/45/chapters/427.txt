Chapter 428: Is This Considered Ostentatious?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Everyone’s hearts were heavy, as if they had just entered this industry. Their palms could not help but be filled with sweat.

Of course, there were also some people who were especially depressed, because in their opinion, there was a 90% chance that Qiao Nian would get first place.

Qiao Nian had already obtained a glass-type imperial jade. If they wanted to defeat her, they would have to obtain an even larger imperial jade.

Imperial jade was rare to begin with. Getting a bigger imperial jade was even harder than winning the lottery.

Many people had long given up on getting first place and only hoped to enter the top 20.

At this moment, the cutting masters also became busy, but no one was willing to look for Zhang Yong to cut their stones.

Zhang Yong stood rooted to the ground dejectedly. He looked down at his hands. It seemed that there was no place for him in this industry anymore. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Nian’s earlier action had cut off all his other routes.

Zhang Yong clenched his fists tightly. Many people felt that he was very talented in cutting raw materials. If not for Qiao Nian, he might have become a grandmaster in cutting raw materials.

Qiao Nian had ruined everything for him.

A trace of killing intent flashed across Zhang Yong’s eyes.

Qiao Nian’s gaze was fixed on Lu Zhu. She was so curious about what kind of jadeite Lu Zhu could find that she didn’t notice Zhang Yong’s gaze at all.

......

At this moment, Qiao Yu walked towards Qiao Nian.

Ah Rao immediately stood beside Qiao Nian and looked at Qiao Yu warily.

Qiao Yu completely ignored Ah Rao’s gaze. He walked up to Qiao Nian and asked calmly, “When did you learn how to gamble on stones?”

Qiao Nian had nothing to say to Qiao Yu. She said perfunctorily, “I was just lucky!”

Qiao Yu’s eyes darkened slightly. He looked at Qiao Nian suspiciously and said, “If you’re lucky, you’ll get imperial jade?”

Anyway, he didn’t believe it.

“What do you want?” Qiao Nian asked impatiently.

“Nian’er, you’re attracting too much attention today!” Qiao Yu looked at Qiao Nian, his eyes so gentle that water could drip from them.

Nian’er?

When Qiao Nian heard this, she was slightly stunned.

If she remembered correctly, the last time Qiao Yu had called her that was on her seventh birthday.

At that time, she treated Qiao Yu as her own brother.

However, ever since that incident, they had nothing to do with each other anymore.

Ah Rao could sense the turbulent atmosphere between the two of them. If he wasn’t wrong, they should be acquaintances.

With that thought, he wasn’t as wary as before.

His mission was to protect Qiao Nian, not to make her cut off all social interactions.

Qiao Nian looked up at Qiao Yu and asked coldly, “You make it sound so nice, but it’s just to fight for the benefits you deserve. Is that considered ostentatious?”

If she had chosen to keep a low profile like before, she probably wouldn’t have survived until now.

“Now you’ve got an imperial jade in your possession. A lot of people have their eyes on you, and you—”

Qiao Yu had wanted to say that Qiao Nian was beautiful, but then he realized that it wasn’t appropriate to say such things under such circumstances.

He pursed his lips slightly and said, “You’re dressed very dazzlingly today. As the saying goes, a strong dragon can’t suppress a local snake. It’s better for you to go back early and not stay here!”

Qiao Nian rejected Qiao Yu’s suggestion without hesitation. “Thank you for your kindness, but I still have something to do here. If I don’t get the champion prize this time, I won’t go back!”

Qiao Yu was slightly stunned and asked in surprise, “Why do you want that?”

“Do you live by the sea? Why do you care so much?” Qiao Nian asked.

“Nian’er, listen to me, you…” As Qiao Yu spoke, he took a step forward. Before he could finish speaking, his vision was blocked by Ah Rao.
