Chapter 339: Take Action

When Qin Lu heard Gu Qi’s words, her face instantly turned red. Not only was Gu Qi good at speaking, but his ability to express himself was also much clearer than other children.

However, Qin Lu didn’t want to admit her mistake. She said furiously, “You said that Student Zhang stole your nine Chinese rings, but she said that you stole his nine Chinese rings.”

“But Teacher can’t prove that I stole Student Zhang’s nine Chinese rings!” Gu Qi said calmly.

“You…”

Qin Lu was about to say something when Qiao Nian interrupted him. “Teacher, I’ll give you a chance now. If you don’t want to blow this matter up, go and explain the situation to the principal. You’d better pack up and leave as soon as possible!”

Qiao Nian no longer wanted to listen to Qin Lu’s next words. When she thought about how Gu Qi’s teacher looked, she realized that Gu Qi was clearly so smart and adorable. He had almost been let down by such a teacher. She wondered how many children had been let down by such a teacher.

The attitude of a kindergarten teacher had a huge impact on a child’s growth.

She could not let this fool delay the child’s growth!

When Qin Lu heard Qiao Nian’s words, she couldn’t help but laugh. With disdain written all over her face, she said, “You want me to get lost? Do you have the ability to do so? Also, do you know who runs this school? How can you, lowly mongrel, decide whether I stay or leave?”

Qiao Nian squatted in front of Gu Qi and helped him straighten his clothes. Only then did she say, “Be good. Go to the classroom and wait for me for a while. Also, you can lend the nine Chinese rings to your classmates for a while, okay?”

Gu Qi nodded. “Okay.”

Gu Qi understood that his auntie did not want him to hear the rest of the conversation. Hence, he walked into the classroom, not forgetting to close the door.

Qiao Nian’s expression instantly darkened. Her expression was like winter frost, exuding a cold aura. She pulled Qin Lu to the blind spot by the classroom window and slapped her again without hesitation.

Slap!

Qin Lu spat out blood. She looked at Qiao Nian in shock and questioned, “Is there something wrong with your brain? How dare you behave atrociously here? Ah…”

Before Qin Lu could finish speaking, Qiao Nian kicked her away.

Qin Lu fell heavily to the ground. The pain was unbearable.

“I’m a mutt, right? I’ll tell you now what happens to teachers who can’t set a good example for their children!”

With that, Qiao Nian slapped Qin Lu’s face.

Qiao Nian wasn’t an impulsive person. This time, Qin Lu had crossed the line. She couldn’t hold back any longer.

Qiao Nian grabbed Qin Lu’s hair and forced her to look at her. “Do you think you can bully my child just because he doesn’t have a backer?”

Qin Lu felt as if her scalp was about to be pulled off. It was so painful that her tears were about to fall, but her words were still unforgiving. “I’m telling you, if you dare to touch a hair on my head, my aunt will never let you off!”

When Qiao Nian heard Qin Lu’s words, her lips curved up slightly. She kicked Qin Lu aside and took out her phone to make a call.

In less than a second, the call went through.

Qiao Nian’s voice was cold as she questioned, “Qin Chuan, what kind of bullsh*t teacher did you hire in your kindergarten?”

“Oh, what’s wrong with my Young Mistress again? Let’s talk things out nicely. Don’t get angry again!”

Qin Lu, who was lying at the side, froze when she heard the principal’s name. She looked up at Qiao Nian, surprise flashing in her eyes.

How dare this woman call the principal by his name?

She was definitely putting on an act. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The principal was such a big shot. Her aunt had to bow down to the principal.

“Do you think you can make me leave with just a phone call? Let me tell you, don’t even think about it!”

Qiao Nian didn’t even bother giving Qin Lu a glance. She glanced at the name of the class and continued, “The form teacher of the kindergarten’s Little Sunflower Class 3, Qin Lu. She’s abusing a child. How do we settle this?”
