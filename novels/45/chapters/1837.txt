Translator: Atlas Studios    Editor: Atlas Studios

Lu Zhu was the eldest son of the family. For so many years, he had been in charge of the Lu family’s company. Seeing that the problem was more comprehensive, he pondered for a moment and continued, “I’ve observed Auntie Cao. Auntie Cao is just thoughtful. She treats the Lu family as her own home.’

“Back then, Mom was busy with her career, so Auntie Cao raised us. Sugar, we believe you, but we hope that it’s not her. After all, she’s very important to Mom and Dad. If they know that the mole is Auntie Cao, they’ll definitely be deeply shocked.”

When Lu Rao and Lu Jiang heard Lu Zhu’s words, their eyes were firm and their attitudes were clear.

If the mole was really Auntie Cao, they would never let her off!

“Of course. If she’s a traitor, I’ll definitely make her pay the price.” Lu Zhu’s expression turned serious, and he exuded a cold aura. ‘Don’t worry, I’ll definitely investigate everyone carefully. I won’t let anyone suspicious off.” When Qiao Nian heard this, her heart warmed.

Lu Nian nodded sensibly and continued, “Your trip to Europe went very smoothly. The mole must have received news from there as well. I believe he will definitely take more precautions. Looks like it’s even more difficult to investigate the mole under such circumstances.”

Gu Zhou’s lips curved up slightly as he said, “It’s precisely because this matter is more difficult that I asked you to investigate. I believe you and Big Brother will definitely find out about who the mole is as soon as possible.”

Gu Zhou trusted their strength very much.

Qiao Nian’s expression grew more and more serious. She frowned slightly and said, “This is a critical moment. We should all be prepared. Nothing must go wrong. Now it is the calm before the storm.”

After saying this, Qiao Nian felt nervous herself.

Gu Zhou sensed the change in Qiao Nian and reached out to hold her hand. He looked at her gently and comforted her. “Don’t worry, they’re at a disadvantage now, and we already have the advantage. As long as we guard against them well, they’ll definitely be fine.”

Now that the Lu and Gu families had joined forces, they could cause quite a stir in the world.

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, the nervous feeling in her heart gradually disappeared. Her lips curved up slightly as she nodded and said, “Yes.

No matter who the enemy was, they would deal with whatever came their way. There would be no problem.

“Since we’re almost done discussing, let’s discuss other things later.” Qiao

Nian yawned lazily and narrowed her eyes slightly. “We’ll talk about the rest when Madam President, Lina, and Chen Qing return!”

She hadn’t interacted well with the children last night, but she could play with them today.

Seeing that Qiao Nian was much thinner than before, and seeing the dark circles under her eyes, Lu Zhu’s heart couldn’t help but ache for her. “Then rest well. Take good care of yourself. Only then can you take good care of the three children.”Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Qiao Nian smiled, her beautiful fox-like eyes already curved into crescents. “I understand. Thank you for your concern, Brother.”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou and said, “Stay and chat with my brothers. I’ll go out. ”

Naturally, Gu Zhou tucked Qiao Nian’s hair behind her ear. He nodded slightly and watched as Qiao Nian left the study.

Qiao Nian left the study, closed the door, and walked towards the three children’s rooms. At this moment, hurried footsteps came from behind.

The footsteps grew faster and faster. She turned around and saw Lu Qi wearing a white sweater, running happily towards her.

“Sister!” Lu Qi hugged Qiao Nian, her eyes filled with joy.

Qiao Nian smiled at the lively Lu Qi and teased, “Are you so eager to see me?”

“Of course. You’re my sister!” Holding Qiao Nian’s arm, Lu Qi walked towards the three children’s room and said jealously, “I wanted to talk to Sister after dinner. I didn’t expect you to be taken away by my brothers.”

Lu Qi’s long eyelashes trembled slightly, fluttering in a very adorable manner.

“I was busy just now. Now that I’m free, I can spend more time with you.” As Qiao Nian spoke, she thought of the direction Lu Qi had come from.. “Were you taking Song Yu t s pulse just now?”
