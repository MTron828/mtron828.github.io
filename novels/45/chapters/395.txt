Chapter 396: Regret

When Old Madam Gu saw Jiang Yue like this, she was also very sad. It was so painful that it was difficult to breathe. However, as long as she thought of what Jiang Yue had done before, she couldn’t help but clench her fists tightly and make up her mind.

She couldn’t be soft-hearted anymore. If she softened this time, she didn’t know what danger Nian Nian would face in the future.

If she softened this time, would Jiang Yue become fearless? She might even do something worse in the future.

Old Madam Gu tried her best to suppress the pain in her heart and said indifferently, “From today onwards, the Gu family will no longer be your home.”

Jiang Yue looked at Old Madam Gu in disbelief, as if she had been struck by lightning.

“No, Grandma, no…”

Jiang Yue cried as she crawled to Old Madam Gu and kowtowed hard. She cried until she was out of breath. “Grandma, I was wrong previously. I was blinded by the benefits. I beg you not to chase me away. I only have you.”

Zhao Qian, who had been standing silently at the side, sighed helplessly. She had only just found out that Jiang Yue had done so many things. She really did not expect her to do such a thing.

Actually, Zhao Qian still felt a little sorry for Jiang Yue. Both of them were living in the Gu family, so they didn’t feel safe.

However, the only difference between her and Jiang Yue was that she knew that she had to create her own life in the future, not just rely on the Gu family.

What Zhao Qian hoped for now was to get an acceptance letter from a Design University in France!

When Old Madam Gu saw Jiang Yue like this, her heart ached terribly. She bent down and wanted to help Jiang Yue up, but after thinking about it, she retracted her hand helplessly and sighed. “You should leave!”

Although it was only three words, to Old Madam Gu, it was as if all her strength had been drained and she instantly aged a few years.

Jiang Yue felt as if her entire world had collapsed. She looked up at Old Madam Gu and begged, “Grandma, I really know my mistake this time. I will never do such a thing again. I will be filial to you, take care of you, and be respectful to Second Sister-in-law. Grandma, please give me a chance. Don’t be so heartless…”

She really knew she was in the wrong.

The butler stood at the side coldly. He had been by Old Madam’s side for so long and had seen too many people and things. He did not think that Jiang Yue really knew her mistake. Jiang Yue only realized that she was wrong because of Old Madam’s will.

Therefore, the butler did not feel that Jiang Yue was pitiful. He only felt that Miss Zhao Qian was commendable and knew her limits no matter what she did.

The butler walked forward and looked at Jiang Yue coldly. He reprimanded, “Miss Jiang, if you hadn’t seen the will, would you really have regretted it? Would you have reflected on yourself like now?”

Jiang Yue was slightly stunned. Previously, she had criticized her grandmother because she was biased.

It was only after reading the will that she realized that her grandmother was not biased.

Was that a problem?

The butler said with a look of disappointment, “The outcome was obvious. You only felt that Old Madam had you in her heart because of the money. In other words, it was only right for Old Madam to leave all her assets to Second Madam, because you were only her adopted granddaughter.”

“Old Madam worked so hard to raise you up, and she had long paved a future for you. Did she raise you to become a murderer?! Do you think she didn’t feel pain when she chased you away? She spent more than ten years raising you, but she had no choice but to chase you out! She’s the one who should feel the most pain!” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“I—I’m sorry. I was—”

The butler interrupted Jiang Yue mercilessly and continued, “Your enlightenment this time is because of money. You know that if you leave the Gu family, you’ll have nothing!”
