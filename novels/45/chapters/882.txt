883 Fainted

Time had passed, and the two of them had actually gotten along.

Time was truly a mage.

Qiao Nian smiled and shook her head. “Actually, it wasn’t hard on me. My heart just ached for Gu Qi and Xiao Shi.”

“Hm?”

!!

Qiao Nian sighed and said, “Gu Qi has always thought that Song Man was his biological mother. At that time, he happily swapped identities with Xiao Shi and went to meet Song Man alone, but…”

She paused for a moment and continued, “But Xiao Qi had an argument with Song Man because of me. In a fit of anger, Song Man slapped Xiao Qi!”

Seeing Gu Zhou’s expression darken, Qiao Nian hurriedly continued, “Don’t worry too much. Xiao Qi’s face is fine.”

“We should have let Song Man live. Let her live a life worse than death.” Gu Zhou’s eyes were cold, and his voice was like a demon from hell.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips and said, “This is all in the past. As long as Xiao Qi finds out that Song Man isn’t his biological mother, he definitely won’t think about this anymore.”

Gu Zhou nodded in agreement. He was very curious as to why Song Man had to die.

“What I’m most worried about is Xiao Shi,” Qiao Nian said seriously. “Xiao Shi has been by Song Man’s side. She has the deepest feelings for Song Man. I think she might not be able to accept that Song Man was just using her because the most important person in her heart at that time was Song Man.”

Qiao Nian continued, “I just told Xiao Shi that actually, Song Man cares a lot about her. For the sake of Xiao Shi’s mental health, let’s portray Song Man as a mother who likes her very much!”

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian with a complicated expression.

Qiao Nian really liked Gu Qi and Xiao Shi and placed these two children in her heart.

“Nian’er.”

“What’s wrong?” Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion.

Gu Zhou moved his lips slightly, but no words came out. He reached out his long arm and pulled Qiao Nian into his arms.

Qiao Nian’s nose bumped into Gu Zhou’s chest. It hurt a little.

The tip of her nose was filled with Gu Zhou’s unique fragrance. Listening to his strong heartbeat, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but blush.

She did not push Gu Zhou away, but let him hug her.

There were many people in the corridor. They walked back and forth. Every time they passed by Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian, they would look at them.

After an unknown period of time, Gu Zhou’s low and magnetic voice rang in Qiao Nian’s ears.

“Nian’er, no matter who their biological mother is, don’t leave me, okay?”

Gu Zhou sounded a little uneasy, as if he was really worried that she would leave him.

This was the first time Qiao Nian had seen Gu Zhou like this. In the past, Gu Zhou would only speak his mind coldly and domineeringly. He had never discussed anything with her.

Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat. Actually, she didn’t want to leave these two children either. She really liked Gu Qi and Xiao Shi. It was as if staying by their side could make up for the pain of losing her children in the past.

In the past, she had wanted to leave Gu Zhou every day. Now, she sincerely wanted to stay.

During this period of time, not only had Gu Zhou changed, but she had also changed.

Gu Zhou was not just Gu Zhou, but also the brother in white who had saved her.

Qiao Nian didn’t answer Gu Zhou directly. Instead, she reached out and hugged Gu Zhou, using her actions to tell him.

The uneasiness in Gu Zhou’s eyes instantly dissipated, leaving only peace of mind.

He gently closed his eyes. When he opened them again, his vision was blurry. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“I—”

Gu Zhou had just said one word when he fainted, his body pressing against Qiao Nian’s.

Qiao Nian helped Gu Zhou up in a panic, struggling to support this man who was more than a head taller than her.

“Gu Zhou?”

Qiao Nian called out.

Then the man on top of her didn’t answer.

Only then did Qiao Nian realize that Gu Zhou had really fainted.

When she realized this, her heart skipped a beat. Fear and unease welled up in her heart.

“Gu Chuan!” Qiao Nian called out in a panic, her eyes filled with unease.

No matter what she called out, Gu Zhou did not respond.

Qiao Nian hurriedly helped Gu Zhou up. In a panic, she shouted, “Nurse, where is the nurse?”
