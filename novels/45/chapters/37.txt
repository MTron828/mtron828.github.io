Chapter 38: He Will Protect Her

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Seeing Gu Zhou appear, Qiao Xin shuddered involuntarily.

Su Yan sensed that Qiao Xin wasn’t feeling well. He looked at her worriedly and whispered, “Xin Xin, if you’re unwell, can I take you to the hospital?” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Su Yan had never been interested in gossip. He felt that he might as well use the time to read more books.

“I… I’m fine,” Qiao Xin said gently. How could she leave? She wanted to see Qiao Nian humiliated by Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou stood next to Qiao Nian. His facial features were well-defined, and he looked extremely distinguished. He raised his chin slightly, like a proud and aloof king.

Someone recognized Gu Zhou and exclaimed, “Isn’t this the Second Young Master of the Gu family?”

Everyone gasped and looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief.

“He’s not ugly at all!”

“He’s so handsome. I want to give birth to his child!”

“Oh dear, if I had known, I would have married into the Gu family!”

…

The socialites present murmured among themselves.

The Gu family was the most powerful family in An City. No aristocratic family dared to go against the Gu family. Even though it was rumored that Second Young Master Gu was ugly and short-lived, many socialites still volunteered to marry into the Gu family. However, the Gu family did not find any of them suitable.

Everyone stared at Gu Zhou. They knew that Gu Zhou was someone they could not afford to offend.

Gu Zhou’s tone seemed to indicate that he disapproved strongly of Shen Ming’s actions.

Although everyone knew that Qiao Nian was Gu Zhou’s bride, they also knew that the two of them hadn’t been married for long. Moreover, some people had heard that Gu Zhou didn’t seem to like Qiao Nian. Otherwise, Gu Zhou would be the one bringing Qiao Nian to this banquet.

Qiao Nian stood beside Gu Zhou. Lifting her eyes slightly, she glanced at the cold aura surrounding Gu Zhou. She narrowed her eyes. She was curious about what Gu Zhou intended to do.

“Second Young Master, long time no see,” Shen Ming said through gritted teeth. He had wanted to make Qiao Nian take the blame while Gu Zhou wasn’t around.

But by the looks of it, this plan would no longer work.

Gu Zhou lifted his eyes and looked at Qiao Nian. The coldness in his aura dissipated to a considerable extent as he said gently, “Nian Nian, you’re too good-tempered. That’s why you get bullied.”

Shen Ming felt like he had been slapped in the face. He felt awkward and helpless, but he couldn’t say anything because the Shen family still had to rely on the Gu family.

Matriarch Shen looked at Qiao Nian with a complicated expression, then her gaze fell on Matriarch Gu, who looked gratified. Her heart skipped a beat. She did not expect Gu Zhou to stand on Qiao Nian’s side.

Matriarch Shen had already sent people to keep an eye on Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian. The information she received was that Gu Zhou didn’t like Qiao Nian, but that didn’t seem to be the case now.

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze. Obediently, she gave an affirmative response.

Gu Zhou walked up to Matriarch Shen and Matriarch Gu and asked, “Grandma, Madam Shen, how have you been?”

Matriarch Shen’s heart was in her throat. She had been living quite well, but her life would take a turn for the worse very soon.

However, Matriarch Shen still had to follow the rules of etiquette. “Thank you for your concern. I’m fine. I just can’t believe that such a thing has happened—what will outsiders think!”

Gu Zhou’s cold gaze fell on Shen Ming’s face. He continued, “The events today have to be investigated thoroughly. We can’t let outsiders make fun of us!”

As Gu Zhou spoke, he gave Lin Nan a look.

Wearing a well-tailored suit, Lin Nan looked around at the entire crowd. With a cold expression, he pushed his gold-rimmed glasses up and said loudly, “Everyone, please don’t record any videos or take any photographs. If any videos are leaked tonight, I’m afraid none of you will be able to attend banquets of this kind ever again!”

Most of the guests here today were people with money and status in An City. Hearing Lin Nan’s words, they weren’t too annoyed and deleted the videos on their phones quietly. As for what they were discussing in the group chat, it hardly mattered anymore. After all, everyone in the group was present today, which meant that this incident would not be leaked to anyone else.

Knowing that this matter would not spread further, Shen Ming secretly heaved a sigh of relief. He did not have the ability to openly threaten those people. Only Gu Zhou had the capability to do such a thing.

Shen Ming looked toward the gardener and asked sternly, “Useless thing, what’s your name? Tell me the whole story!”

“My… my name is Sun Jiu,” Sun Jiu said shakily. He lowered his head even more, his voice trembling. “Tonight… tonight…”

Before Sun Jiu could finish speaking, Shen Xing spoke impatiently, “Sun Jiu, do think this through carefully. Tell us the truth. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being rude!”

When Sun Jiu heard Shen Xing’s words, he couldn’t help but tremble. He looked at Shen Xing with trepidation and pursed his lips slightly before saying, “M-Miss Qiao gave me money to…”

Upon hearing this, the corners of Shen Xing’s lips turned up slightly.. She looked at Qiao Nian with a haughty expression. Her eyes were vicious as she snapped, “Qiao Nian, so it really was you!”
