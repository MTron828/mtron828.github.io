He really liked Xiao Bao. He also liked being with Xiao Bao, and he liked hearing Xiao Bao call him “Daddy”.

Here, he was always in a tense state. Only when he was with Xiao Bao could he feel relaxed and happy.

However, he knew very well that he was not Xiao Bao’s biological father after all.

Some things had to get back on track in the end.

Mr. Chen looked at Xiao Bao in front of him and said softly, “Xiao Bao, actually, I’m your uncle, not your daddy.”

Xiao Bao nodded and said seriously, “I know, but I consider you my Daddy. I was raised by Daddy!”

When Mr. Chen heard Xiao Bao’s young voice, his heart was filled with gratitude.

“Xiao Bao, but biologically speaking, I’m really your uncle.”

When Xiao Bao heard Mr. Chen’s words, his eyes darkened. He muttered softly, “Daddy, I understand. Biologically speaking, Gu Zhou is my daddy and you’re my uncle, right?”

Mr. Chen nodded.

“But Xiao Bao just thinks that you’re my daddy!” Xiao Bao pouted stubbornly.

When Mr. Chen heard Xiao Bao’s words, he placed his hands on his shoulders. “Now, you have to start getting used to me being your uncle. You have to start changing your words!”

Xiao Bao’s beautiful eyes were filled with confusion. His eyes instantly turned red as he asked anxiously, “Daddy, do you not want Xiao Bao anymore? Xiao Bao will be obedient. Xiao Bao will never do anything to make Daddy unhappy again. Daddy, don’t leave Xiao Bao behind, okay?”

Before Mr. Chen could speak, Xiao Bao hugged his neck and said sadly, “Xiao Bao wants Daddy.”

Mr. Chen’s heart softened. He pursed his lips slightly and gently patted Xiao Bao’s back. “Xiao Bao, don’t be so agitated. Let me finish speaking.”

“I won’t listen, I won’t listen. I won’t call Daddy Uncle. I won’t change my words!” Xiao Bao stubbornly hugged Mr. Chen’s neck.

Mr. Chen slowly closed his eyes and heaved a sigh of relief. He carried Xiao Bao to the sofa and sat down. He let go of Xiao Bao’s hand, which was wrapped around his neck, and looked at him seriously. “Xiao Bao, I won’t abandon you. I just wanted you to call me Uncle!”

“Why?” Xiao Bao frowned and asked with red-rimmed eyes, “Why can’t I have two fathers? You’re my father, and Gu Zhou is my second father. Isn’t that good?”

Seeing Xiao Bao’s aggrieved expression, Mr. Chen was also very sad, but there were some things he had to let Xiao Bao understand. He said softly, “Xiao Bao, listen to Daddy.”

Xiao Bao lowered his head and clenched his fists, muttering.

“For special reasons, you can only follow me. That’s why you think that I’m the person who treats you the best. But think about it from another perspective. If you grow up by your daddy’s side, he’ll definitely dote on you and love you as much as I do. He’ll let you live happily every day.” Mr. Chen tried his best to explain to Xiao Bao in words that Xiao Bao could understand. “He just didn’t have the chance to express his fatherly love for you.”

Xiao Bao looked up at Mr. Chen and shook his head. “Daddy, you’re wrong.”

“No matter what the reason is, Xiao Bao was raised by Daddy and spoiled by Daddy. Why does Daddy insist that I call you Uncle?” Xiao Bao frowned and pouted. “I watched television previously. I heard that some families will adopt children. Those families who adopt children will also let that child call them Daddy and Mommy!”

Mr. Chen was speechless.

That made sense.

“You’re clearly my daddy. Even if you know Gu Zhou and he is your younger brother, you’re still my daddy. You raised me, so you’re my daddy!” Xiao Bao said stubbornly. “If Daddy doesn’t want me because of Gu Zhou, then I don’t want that second daddy Gu Zhou anymore!”

“Don’t spout nonsense!” Mr. Chen snapped.

Tears instantly rolled down Xiao Bao’s face. He looked at Mr. Chen like a poor puppy about to be abandoned by its owner!
