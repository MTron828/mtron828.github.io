With this thought in mind, Song Man slowly squatted down in front of Xiao Shi and touched her face gently. She asked softly, “Xiao Shi, Mommy has missed you so much these past two days. Did you miss Mommy?”

Gu Qi looked at the woman in front of him. Although he knew that she was his mommy, for some reason, he still felt that she was very unfamiliar.

This unfamiliarity made him unwilling to speak. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

He had never felt this way about Auntie Nian Nian in the past.

However, he still liked the feeling of her touching his face. For the first time in his life, he felt his mommy touch his face.

He was also a child with a mommy now.

Qin Chuan had already sent Song Man over. He glanced at the time. As he had other things to do, he instructed Song Man, “Miss Song, I’ve already sent you over. You can stay here in peace in the future. I won’t disturb you and your daughter anymore. You two should catch up!”

Song Man stood up and looked at Qin Chuan with a gentle smile. She nodded. “Thank you for sending me here, Mr. Qin.”

“You’re welcome!”

Qin Chuan left with his subordinates. Only Song Man and Gu Qi were left in the living room of the Dongjiang villa.

Gu Qi sat where he was. He didn’t know how to speak to his mommy. He glanced at the time. It was past three in the afternoon, and it wasn’t time to eat. He might as well ask his mommy if she wanted afternoon tea.

Gu Qi was conflicted about how to take the initiative to speak.

When Song Man heard the door of the villa close, her gentle face instantly turned cold. She looked at Gu Qi coldly.

Gu Qi noticed the change in Song Man’s gaze and was slightly stunned. He sensed that his mother had already retracted her hand.

The warmth in her hand instantly disappeared.

Before he could feel his mommy’s gentleness, it had already disappeared. All that was left was coldness.

At this moment, his mother was just like nanny Zhang Yi in the past. She looked at him with only coldness and disgust.

Gu Qi was a little puzzled. Why was Mommy looking at him like this? Could it be that Mommy already knew that he wasn’t Xiao Shi?

Song Man looked at Gu Qi with a dark expression and questioned coldly, “Xiao Shi, why are you here? Why didn’t you pick Mommy up?”

Gu Qi frowned.

Mommy thought he was Xiao Shi.

Did Mommy usually talk to Xiao Shi like this?

Why did Mommy suddenly seem to be a different person?

“I—”

Before Gu Qi could finish speaking, Song Man interrupted him. “You what?”

However, Song Man’s tone was identical to Zhang Yi’s.

Gu Qi understood that she was angry.

However, Gu Qi couldn’t understand why his mommy was angry.

Xiao Shi was still so young. Why couldn’t Mommy come over herself? Why did she take her anger out on her?

Gu Qi met Song Man’s eyes. For some reason, he recalled Auntie Nian Nian’s gaze on him.

Auntie Nian Nian had never looked at him with such dissatisfaction and anger.

Auntie Nian Nian looked at him with a gentle and kind gaze.

Gu Qi thought of Auntie Nian Nian and mustered his courage. “Auntie Nian Nian felt that the journey was a little far and wanted me to see Mommy as soon as possible, so she got someone to pick you up!”

When Song Man heard Xiao Shi’s words, her expression instantly darkened.

If it were any other time, Xiao Shi would have apologized a long time ago.

Now, Xiao Shi was actually quibbling!

Auntie Nian Nian?

Could it be that Xiao Shi was talking about Qiao Nian?

Song Man’s expression darkened. She clearly liked that woman.

At the thought of Xiao Shi liking Qiao Nian, she felt uncomfortable.

Now, because of Qiao Nian, Xiao Shi had grown distant from her and treated her coldly!

Song Man questioned coldly, “Do you like Auntie Nian Nian a lot?”

Gu Qi nodded without hesitation. “Yes!”

Gu Qi believed that even if Xiao Shi was here, she would answer this question honestly.

Song Man’s heart had already sunk to the bottom. Her anger was burning as she tried hard to suppress it. She hesitated for a moment before pulling Gu Qi into her arms and saying apologetically, “Xiao Shi, I’m sorry. It’s Mommy’s fault. Mommy shouldn’t have spoken to you like this. Mommy has been separated from you for so long. I was worried that something would happen to you, so I was so angry. That’s why my tone wasn’t kind. Don’t be angry with Mommy!”
