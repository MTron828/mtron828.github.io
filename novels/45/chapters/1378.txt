1379 Going to the Hospital

Lu Qi was very worried about Qin Chuan’s condition, but she didn’t dare to speak. She was worried that she would disturb Qiao Nian’s treatment of Qin Chuan.

Qiao Nian unbuttoned Qin Chuan’s clothes and began to perform acupuncture on him.

Gu Zhou stood above and called Chen Qing. He briefly told Chen Qing about the situation here and asked Chen Qing to bring someone over. Then, he asked Chen Qing to call the ambulance over. When he hung up, he looked down worriedly.

Soon, Chen Qing brought people over, including Lu Zhu and Lu Nian.

Chen Qing’s men first placed a ladder down and gestured for Lu Qi to climb up.

Lu Qi didn’t even look at the ladder at the side. All her attention was on Qin Chuan.

Qiao Nian had just finished performing acupuncture. Seeing that Lu Qi was unwilling to go up, she walked up to her and reached out to hug her, comforting her gently. “Don’t worry, I’ve already stopped the bleeding. Be good. Go up first.”

“Sister, then Senior…” Lu Qi looked at Qiao Nian with teary eyes, looking extremely pitiful.

“In a while, the medical staff will come down and put him on a medical bed.” Qiao Nian said gently, “Go up and wait. We still have to go to the hospital early.”

Lu Qi nodded with teary eyes.

After Lu Qi climbed up, she saw the bright world outside. Seeing Lu Zhu and Lu Nian walking over, she was about to call for help when her legs gave way and she almost fell to the ground.

Qiao Nian followed Lu Qi out closely. She quickly supported Lu Qi and called out anxiously, “Qi Qi, Qi Qi!”

However, Lu Qi’s eyes were tightly shut and she did not respond. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Qiao Nian frowned and took Lu Qi’s pulse.

Lu Zhu and Lu Nian walked over. Seeing the blood on Lu Qi’s hand, their expressions changed. “Qi Qi is injured?”

After taking her pulse, Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief and said, “Qi Qi is fine. She’s just a little tired. I’ll just give her a nutritional injection.”

Lu Zhu hurriedly called for someone to help Lu Qi to the bed. Seeing Qiao Nian walk towards the entrance of the cave, Lu Nian asked worriedly, “How’s Qin Chuan?”

“We’ll only be able to confirm his condition after we go to the hospital for an X-ray.” Qiao Nian’s heart clenched into a ball as she stared unblinkingly at Qin Chuan, who was lying on the ground and breathing weakly.

Chen Qing’s men went down and brought a bed with them. After they laid the bed flat and moved Qin Chuan to the bed, there was still a rope tied to the four corners of the bed. They just had to pull the bed up.

Qin Chuan was carried into an ambulance, and Qiao Nian followed suit. She looked at Qin Chuan worriedly.

Half an hour later, the car arrived at the hospital. Qin Chuan was pushed into the operating theater, while Lu Qi was arranged to receive nutritional injections in the ward.

Lu Qi had been tense from the shock. Now that she was relaxed, she fainted.

Qin Chuan’s current condition was not optimistic. After the doctor took an X-ray of him, he confirmed that two of Qin Chuan’s ribs had been broken. Unfortunately, his ribs were still inserted into his organs, which was why he was vomiting blood.

Qiao Nian wasn’t good at orthopedic medicine. She could only stand guard outside the emergency room, praying that Qin Chuan would be safe.

Seeing Qiao Nian’s frown, Gu Zhou walked over to her and reached out to hold her hand. He comforted her in a low voice, “He’ll definitely be fine. Don’t worry.”

Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou, her eyes red-rimmed. She pursed her lips slightly. She wanted to say something, but she didn’t know what to say.

Qin Chuan was also family to her. They had grown up together, and she had never expected anything to happen to him. Not only could she not accept that Qin Chuan was so seriously injured, but she also could not accept that he might leave her.

Gu Zhou reached out and put his arm around Qiao Nian’s shoulder. He patted her shoulder gently and said in a low voice, “He’ll be fine.”

“Okay.” Qiao Nian lowered her gaze, hiding the worry in her eyes.

Time passed bit by bit. Every second and minute was torture for Qiao Nian.

Suddenly, footsteps came from the end of the corridor. The footsteps were getting closer.

Qiao Nian looked up and saw that it was Chen Qing. She took a step forward and asked anxiously, “Chen Qing, how’s the investigation going? Is there any news?”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s question, Chen Qing said solemnly, “I’ve already found out.”
