“Yes.” Qiao Nian nodded. Actually, she was mainly to blame for this. It had nothing to do with him.

“Then Nian Nian, I’ll eat candy next time!”

He looked at Qiao Nian innocently, his eyes filled with obedience.

Qiao Nian almost vomited blood.

Did he even know what kissing meant?

No, he just wanted to eat candy.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian said, “Okay, I’ll get you a few candies!”

Zhou Zhou shook his head and said seriously, “Feed me candy in the same way as just now!”

Qiao Nian was speechless.

She slowly closed her eyes. If she wasn’t wrong, Gu Zhou meant to feed him candy by kissing him?

How could he be so smooth?

How could he tell her such a shy thing with such an innocent expression?

Qiao Nian met those ignorant eyes and suppressed her anger. She coaxed softly, “What we’re doing is wrong. If you want to eat candy, I’ll just give it to you. After all, we shouldn’t touch each other!”

“But Nian Nian likes Zhou Zhou’s lips a lot!” He looked at Qiao Nian in confusion, tilting his head.

Seeing him like this, Qiao Nian’s heart began to race. Her gaze inadvertently fell on his lips. Thinking of the kiss just now, her face turned redder and redder. She said awkwardly, “It was just an accident. Don’t mind it.”

“But I’m Nian Nian’s husband. Nian Nian is my wife. The two of us should be together!” He frowned, his eyes filled with confusion.

Qiao Nian instantly felt terrible.

What exactly was Zhou Zhou talking about?

He was just one of Gu Zhou’s personalities. How did he know that the two of them were married?

Qiao Nian felt that Zhou Zhou wasn’t as simple as he had imagined.

“Doesn’t Nian Nian want to be with Zhou Zhou forever?” He lowered his eyes slightly and bit his lip. His hands gripped the bathtub tightly as he asked dejectedly.

Qiao Nian felt that he was vividly portraying the words “I pity you”.

Seeing Zhou Zhou like this, she really wanted to pounce on him.

Qiao Nian hurriedly threw all the nonsense in her mind to the back of her mind. Just as she was about to speak, she heard him speak sadly.

“So Nian Nian doesn’t want to marry me…”

“No, that’s not what I meant,” Qiao Nian hurriedly said.

“Then Nian Nian really wants to marry me?” Zhou Zhou’s eyes sparkled as he looked at Qiao Nian expectantly.

Qiao Nian couldn’t refuse. She hurriedly turned around and said coldly, “Alright, get up quickly!”

“Nian Nian, let’s sleep together!”

Qiao Nian was about to walk out when she was so frightened by Zhou Zhou’s words that she almost fell.

Did he want to pounce on her too?

Just as Qiao Nian was about to speak, she heard Zhou Zhou say, “Zhou Zhou has to hug Nian Nian to sleep. That way, Nian Nian won’t be afraid!”

“I’m not afraid to sleep alone!” Suppressing her anger, Qiao Nian turned to look at Zhou Zhou.

“Nian Nian is fierce to me again.” Zhou Zhou looked aggrieved, as if he was a little hurt. “So Nian Nian really doesn’t like me!”

“No,” Qiao Nian said through gritted teeth. She really couldn’t bear to see him suffer.

When Zhou Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he looked up at her and said happily, “Nian Nian, come and take a bath with me. Don’t catch a cold and fall sick again!”

Qiao Nian was speechless.

Qiao Nian finally understood that he was her nemesis. In the end, he still wanted her to shower with him.

Gu Zhou was really not a simple person. Even though he had a split personality who acted young, it could not change his two-faced nature.

Qiao Nian wasn’t afraid of taking a shower with Zhou Zhou, but she was worried that Gu Chuan would come out again.

Of course, if it was Gu Zhou who came out, Gu Zhou would definitely think that she was trying to take advantage of him.

“I’ll go out for a while. Wipe yourself clean and go to bed!” Qiao Nian quickly walked out. She couldn’t be bothered to stay here any longer. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

After Qiao Nian walked out of the bathroom, she walked towards the guest room she was sleeping in.
