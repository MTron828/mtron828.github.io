“Splash!”

The books on the bookshelves were scattered all over the ground. It was simply a mess.

Wright quickly walked to the sofa and sat down. He looked at the scattered books on the ground with a dark expression and gritted his teeth.

At this moment, there was a knock on the door. The assistant’s voice came from outside.

“Prince.”

“Come in!” Wright said, his expression dark.

The assistant, Amon, walked in. Looking at the messy books all over the ground, his heart jumped to his throat. He avoided the books and walked up to Wright, calling out respectfully, “Prince!”

Amon inadvertently saw the wound on Wright’s waist. His expression changed drastically. Frowning, he said worriedly, “Prince, you’re injured. I’ll call the doctor now.”

“Do you want me to be beaten to death by my father?”

Wright said with a dark expression. His gaze was like a sharp blade, scaring Amon so much that he did not dare to look up.

Amon lowered his head and blinked. After some thought, he said, “Prince, I’ll go get the medicine box.”

“Go,” Wright said casually. He looked calm, as if he didn’t care about his wound at all.

Amon hurriedly walked to the storage cabinet at the side and took out the medicine box from the drawer. Then, he walked up to Wright.

Wright had already taken off his clothes, revealing the whip wound. There was still blood seeping out of the wound. Beside the whip wound were some scars of various sizes. It was a ghastly sight. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Amon squatted down beside Wright and skillfully washed his wound with disinfectant.

Wright looked down at Amon beside him. Amon had been by his side for ten years. Every time his father hit him, it was Amon who treated his wound.

Wright gritted his teeth, cold sweat breaking out on his forehead. He clenched his fists tightly, his nails digging into his palms, trying hard to remain calm.

Amon’s movements were very light, but he still heard Wright’s muffled groan. His heart was in his throat, afraid that Wright would lose his temper again.

Soon, Amon bandaged Wright’s wound. He lowered his head and packed the medicine box.

When the wound was bandaged, Wright heaved a sigh of relief. He looked at the wound on his body with a dark expression.

One day, he would definitely return all the pain he had suffered. He would make those people kneel in front of him and beg for mercy. He would stand at the highest point and make everyone revere him.

Silently, Amon tidied up the medicine box. He kept his head lowered, not daring to look into Wright’s eyes. In a low voice, he asked, “Prince, you haven’t eaten this morning. Do you want to have breakfast?”

“Yes,” Wright said casually.

Amon took out his phone and called the people in the kitchen. Then, he lifted the bookshelf up and placed all the books scattered on the ground on the bookshelf.

Wright leaned back on the sofa and closed his eyes to rest. As if he had thought of something, he opened his eyes and looked at Amon. “What kind of person do you think Qiao Nian is?”

When Amon heard Wright’s question, he stopped packing the books and continued, “A dangerous person.”

“She’s indeed very dangerous,” Wright replied casually. He clenched his fists tightly and gritted his teeth. “That kind of woman should disappear as soon as possible, lest she harm others.”

“Yes.” Amon lowered his head and agreed. “I’ll think of a way to get someone to kill her.”

When Wright heard Amon’s words, he looked at him in satisfaction.

As expected of Amon, who had been by his side for ten years. His words were always pleasant to the ear. Unfortunately, he couldn’t kill Qiao Nian yet. “Let her live a little longer. Get someone to bring the person who suggested the heart over.”

Amon agreed.

In less than ten minutes, the kitchen servant brought breakfast over.

The servant placed the dishes on the table and left. After a while, another man walked in.

The man’s hands were cuffed. The moment he entered the room, he immediately knelt on the ground and begged while trembling, “Prince, it’s all my fault. I won’t fail again. Please give me a chance to turn over a new leaf.”

Wright didn’t even look up. He ate his bread slowly.
