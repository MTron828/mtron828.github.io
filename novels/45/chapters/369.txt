“Qiao Nian, what are you doing?”

“Why does she need ink, paper, and inkstone?”

“She’s trying to deceive us!”

…

Jiang Qi, who was standing on the stage, looked at Qiao Nian. Suddenly, an idea flashed in her mind. She asked in disbelief, “Are you planning to copy the stone wall painting?”

When he asked this, Jiang Qi’s back was already drenched in sweat.

Hearing Mr. Jiang Qi’s words, everyone around them was stunned. Their gazes fell on Qiao Nian’s face, and they didn’t dare to breathe too loudly.

“Yes.” Qiao Nian nodded gently.

.

This word was like a bolt of lightning that struck everyone, causing them to be thunderstruck.

Some people felt that Qiao Nian was lying.

The other group of people looked at Qiao Nian with starry eyes.

“If Qiao Nian is really Mr. Huang Shi, then she’s simply a genius!”

......

“She’s accomplished in medicine, and she’s accomplished in the violin. If she’s really Mr. Huang Shi, this is unbelievable!”

“Oh my god, I can’t even imagine it. It’s already not bad for ordinary people to shine in one field, but Miss Qiao is actually so outstanding in so many fields?”

…

When Song Yu heard everyone’s words, she frowned slightly. She was no longer as calm as before, because she could tell from Qiao Nian’s eyes that she wasn’t joking. She was really planning to copy the stone wall painting.

If Qiao Nian wasn’t Mr. Huang Shi, she definitely wouldn’t have dared to say this.

However, there were still some people present who refused to believe that Qiao Nian was Mr. Huang Shi.

“Alright, stop bragging about her. I want to see if she’s Mr. Huang Shi today.”

“How is it possible for a child of a few years old to become a world-renowned painter? Don’t joke around!”

“I think you’ve all been fooled by her! Most children of that age are digging mud!”

…

Yes, in everyone’s eyes, most children who were a few years old loved to play. Even if they learned to draw, it was impossible for them to draw well.

Qiao Nian didn’t care at all about the questioning voices. In her opinion, explaining to these people was just a waste of time.

They would only believe what they believed.

They felt that she was wrong, so no matter what she said, it was all wrong.

The only way to prove herself was to show them.

In less than two minutes, Chen Qing walked in with a few people.

Chen Qing walked up to Qiao Nian first and asked respectfully, “Miss Qiao, these are all good inkstones. Do you think they can be used?”

Actually, Qiao Nian wasn’t that particular about these tools. As long as she could draw, she would be fine. She nodded slightly and said, “No problem.”

Qiao Nian stood in front of the drawing paper, her gaze falling on everyone’s faces. She said, “Everyone, the stone wall painting is a little complicated. It will take some time to copy it on the spot. If you have something to do, you can leave first.”

When everyone heard Qiao Nian’s words, they all shook their heads.

Some people who felt that Qiao Nian was boasting mocked her.

“How can we leave at such an exciting time?”

“Are you thinking of backing out? If you admit your mistake now, we’ll forgive you generously.”

“I think she’s a little afraid.”

…

Of course, there were also some people who had already believed that Qiao Nian was Mr. Huang Shi when Qiao Nian proposed to copy the stone wall painting.

“I’m fine. If I’m lucky enough to see Mr. Huang Shi copy the stone wall painting in my life, I’ll die without regrets!”

“How can I let go of such an exciting scene?”

“I’ve already canceled my meeting. I won’t leave. I want to see Mr. Huang Shi paint with my own eyes.”

…

Some people present were looking forward to it, while others looked down on it.

Just like that, under everyone’s gaze, Qiao Nian laid the drawing paper on the table and began to mix the paint. Then, she picked up a brush and began to sketch.
