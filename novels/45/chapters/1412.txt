1413 Beggar

Moreover, she had only met Senior a few times. Senior had risked his life to protect her.

He had already lost his memory. Why did he still think that they were husband and wife? Did he like her?

Lu Qi didn’t understand why Qin Chuan would say those inexplicable words. With this thought in mind, she asked, “Senior, the doctor said that you’ve lost your memory and can’t remember anything. What you’re saying now might not be your intention…”

Lu Qi wanted to retract her hand, but Qin Chuan was holding on too tightly. She looked up at him, signaling for him to let go.

“I’m sorry.” As Qin Chuan spoke, he let go. He still remembered the softness of Lu Qi’s hands and clenched his fists involuntarily. He looked into Lu Qi’s clear fox-like eyes, and fragments of his memories suddenly appeared in his mind.

Lu Qi’s bright face gradually turned into that of a chubby young girl. Although she had grown up now, her incomparably clear fox-like eyes were still fresh in his mind.

There was a hint of a smile in Qin Chuan’s eyes as he continued, “I remembered a scene previously. In my impression, it was a snowy winter at the entrance of the high school. At that time, I was wearing very thin clothes. At this moment, a girl in a school uniform with a high ponytail walked up to me. She handed me a cup of hot milk.”

Lu Qi looked at Qin Chuan in confusion. Why did she feel a sense of familiarity with what he was saying?

“After she left, I didn’t expect her to return after three minutes. This time, she even gave me a piece of bread.” Qin Chuan still remembered the red mole under the girl’s eye. “She said that after I ate these, I wouldn’t be hungry anymore. I’ll study hard in the future and have a good job when I grow up. Only by experiencing hardship can one taste the sweetness of life in the future. She even gave me all the money she had.”

Lu Qi’s eyes widened uncontrollably.

Qin Chuan said softly and calmly, “Later on, when her classmates called her ‘Lu Qi’, I found out her name.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Lu Qi’s pupils dilated slightly as she looked at Qin Chuan in disbelief. Actually, she had already remembered what Qin Chuan had just said about milk.

That winter was the coldest day. When she entered the school in the morning, she did not expect a beggar to stand at the door. That beggar looked young, but she gave him all her hot milk and bread.

Actually, when she met beggars, she often gave them money, but many people laughed at her for being kind.

She didn’t care about this. She knew that many people pretended to be beggars, but what if the person in front of her was really a beggar?

At that time, she only wanted to help as much as she could. At that time, the beggar at the school gate was wearing very little. It was minus ten degrees Celsius, and he was only wearing a dirty white shirt and dark suit pants.

He was sleeping on a bench by the roadside. The snow was almost covering him. He lay there like that, his hands red from the cold.

As for the other beggars, they had long been wrapped up tightly in a corner to hide from the snow. He seemed to have given up on himself and had no intention of living.

At that time, she noticed him immediately. She didn’t know what he had experienced, but she only knew that if he continued to lie there, he might die!

He had left such a deep impression on her that she had always remembered this.

Lu Qi looked at Qin Chuan in front of her and recalled the beggar lying on the recliner in her memory. She couldn’t believe that the beggar was Qin Chuan.

What was wrong with him back then? Why didn’t he have any intention of living?

Lu Qi blinked, her long eyelashes fluttering. She asked in surprise, “How… how is this possible? How did you become a beggar back then?”

When Qin Chuan heard Lu Qi’s question, he smiled and shook his head. “I can’t remember the past either, nor do I know why I chose to be a beggar back then. However, what made me feel glad was that I met you.”

Their encounter had been like a play. It was unbelievable, but he didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. It was even more unforgettable. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have recalled this memory.
