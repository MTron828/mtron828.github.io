Chapter 624: Misunderstanding Resolved

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

In the past, he wouldn’t have needed to worry about this at all. He didn’t know why he wanted to hide these things either.

Gu Zhou’s frown deepened.

Gu Qi’s thoughts were very simple. He felt that Auntie Nian Nian should be dating his father. Adults should settle their own matters. As a child, he naturally couldn’t interfere.

It didn’t matter if his father didn’t manage to woo Auntie Nian Nian. He would just have to woo her when he grew up.

Gu Zhou looked at Gu Qi’s obedient and smart appearance. His thin lips curved up slightly, revealing a faint smile.

So it had always been a misunderstanding between him and Gu Qi.

Now that the misunderstanding had been resolved, Gu Qi was willing to open his heart to him. The father and son could finally communicate amicably.

In that case, there was no need for him to take out the IOU.

At this moment, there was a knock on the door.

Gu Zhou stood up and carried Gu Qi to the bed. Only then did he look towards the door. His voice was as cold as ever. “Come in.”

Gu Qi sat there with his head lowered.

Qiao Nian pushed open the door and turned around to bring Gu Qi’s medicine in. She smiled at Gu Qi and said gently, “Little Qi, it’s time to take your medicine!”

Qiao Nian had been in the living room on the first floor just now. She felt that it was very unfair to Gu Qi that she had rashly invited Doctor Su over to diagnose Gu Qi’s illness.

When Gu Qi saw Doctor Su’s reaction, he knew that Su Sheng was the doctor.

However, at that time, all she could think about was getting Doctor Su to examine Gu Qi, so she didn’t notice Gu Qi’s expression.

She recalled the first time she had met Gu Qi. In her eyes, Gu Qi was just a smart child.

Gu Qing had told her that autistic patients were more stupid. She felt that she was a little stupid. She should have discovered this problem earlier. Gu Qing’s diagnosis back then was not wrong. Gu Qi was just a child who wanted to seek the attention of adults.

At that time, the more she thought about it, the more she felt that she had gone too far. She had invited the doctor over without distinguishing between the truth and lies.

At that time, she seemed to be no different from the teacher who had punished Gu Qi indiscriminately in kindergarten.

She didn’t believe what she saw. She chose to believe what she heard.

Qiao Nian had come to apologize to Gu Qi.

Gu Qi was a sensitive child. He might be hurt or sad because of this.

Qiao Nian came in with the medicine. Her gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face, and she happened to see Gu Zhou looking at her. For some reason, she felt that Gu Zhou was looking at the wound on her lip.

She licked her lips uncomfortably and said softly, “Chen Qing seems to have something to tell you. Do you want to go over and take a look?”

“Okay.” Gu Zhou recalled the text message Chen Qing had sent him. He finally had news of Gu Chuan.

He glanced at Gu Qi. At this moment, Gu Qi was looking at Qiao Nian with sparkling eyes.

Since Gu Qi had promised not to tell him, he should keep his promise.

Gu Zhou walked towards the door, his hand on the handle. Just as he was about to leave, he couldn’t help but turn back to look at Gu Qi.

At this moment, Gu Qi was still staring unblinkingly at Qiao Nian, not even giving him a glance.

Qiao Nian’s gaze kept falling on Gu Zhou. After Gu Zhou left, she heaved a sigh of relief.

After all, when Gu Zhou was in this room, she could always feel the pressure coming from him. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

After Gu Zhou left, Qiao Nian handed the medicine and a cup of water to Gu Qi and said softly, “Little Qi, you haven’t recovered from your illness. You still need to take your medicine now. You’ll recover after you take it.”

Gu Qi nodded and opened his mouth obediently, letting Qiao Nian put the pill into his mouth. He took the cup and swallowed the pill obediently.

After Gu Qi took the medicine, Qiao Nian took the cup and placed it on the bedside table. She was conflicted about how to tell Gu Qi the truth.

Before Qiao Nian could speak, Gu Qi said, “Auntie Nian Nian, my father likes you. Do you like him?”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She looked at Gu Qi in surprise. She had never expected Gu Qi to say such a thing.
