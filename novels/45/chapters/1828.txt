Lu Nian reluctantly looked away from Qiao Nian’s face. He glanced at Lu Zhu and looked at Qiao Nian again. “Fortunately, I saw you this time and didn’t let Big Brother see you alone.”

When Lu Zhu and Qiao Nian heard Lu Nian’s words, they couldn’t help but laugh.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but ask, “Second Brother, your words are strange. Is there a winner for this?”

Lu Zhu narrowed his eyes slightly and revealed a gentle smile. He smiled and said, “You can’t say that. If Third Brother and Fourth Brother find out that you’re back and even met us, they’ll definitely throw a tantrum because you haven’t seen them yet. I’ll have to trouble you to coax them then.”

Qiao Nian covered her mouth and chuckled. “Looks like I have to coax many children! ”Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The three siblings could not help but laugh.

Auntie Cao, who was standing in the kitchen, heard the laughter coming from the living room. Her brows furrowed even more tightly as she gritted her teeth.

If only that b*tch Qiao Nian had died outside back then.

Auntie Cao panted heavily. She tried her best to calm down. She could not let others discover that something was wrong with her.

Originally, Qiao Nian should have returned to her room to sleep, but because she missed the three children too much, she still went to their room.

The three children had slept together previously, but because Chang Feng was around, Xiao Bao insisted on sleeping in the guest room with him.

At this moment, only Gu Qi and Xiao Shi were left in the room.

Qiao Nian carefully pushed open the door, afraid that she would disturb the two children’s sleep.

She stepped barefoot on the soft carpet and walked towards the bed.

The moonlight shone gently through the window and fell on the two sleeping children.

The two of them breathed evenly. Qiao Nian looked at their chubby faces and couldn’t help but smile. She gently helped them pull up the blanket.

After Qiao Nian was done, she was about to return to her room to sleep. At this moment, a small hand reached out from under the blanket and grabbed her fingers.

Qiao Nian turned around and saw Gu Qi’s sparkling eyes staring unblinkingly at her.

For some reason, Gu Zhou’s gaze appeared in her mind.

Gu Qi and Gu Zhou’s gazes were simply carved from the same mold.

“Xiao Qi?” Qiao Nian squatted by the bed, afraid that she would wake Xiao Shi up. She asked in a low voice, “Why aren’t you sleeping?”

Qiao Nian glanced at Xiao Shi, who was lying on the bed. Xiao Shi was sleeping soundly, and her lips were still curved up, as if she was still dreaming.

“Mommy.” Xiao Qi tried hard to lower his voice. He didn’t want to wake his sister up and moved closer to Qiao Nian’s ear. “l have something to tell you. If I stay here, I’ll disturb her.”

Seeing how serious Gu Qi was, Qiao Nian thought that he was going to say something very serious, so she carried him out.

Just as she returned to her room, Qiao Nian walked to the bed and was about to place Gu Qi on it, but Gu Qi refused to let go of her.

Qiao Nian could only hug him and sit on the bed. She looked at Gu Qi gently.

Seeing that he was just looking at her quietly, her lips curved up involuntarily.

The dim yellow light illuminated the entire room, giving off a warm feeling.

“Xiao Qi, actually, you just want to hug Mommy, right?” Qiao Nian asked gently.

Gu Qi was not good at expressing himself. She could tell that he was a little shy.

Gu Qi hugged Qiao Nian tightly and looked at her seriously. ‘1 1 knew that Mommy would definitely visit us before she slept, so I kept waiting for you to visit us.”

He usually slept early. Today, he had been enduring his fatigue in his pajamas until now because he missed his mommy so much. He wanted to say a few more words to his mommy and hug her for a while longer.

Qiao Nian gently touched Gu Qi’s face, her eyes turning red involuntarily. She gently planted a kiss on Gu Qi’s forehead and said, “Our Xiao Qi is really smart. However, don’t stay up late in the future. Mommy will be at home tomorrow too. She’ll accompany you.”

Gu Qi leaned gently on Qiao Nian’s shoulder. Smelling Qiao Nian t s unique reassuring aura, sleepiness gradually welled up in him. His eyelids grew heavier and heavier, and he nodded in a daze.

Qiao Nian placed Gu Qi on the bed and slept with him..
