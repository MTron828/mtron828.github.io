1068 I will meet you

Whenever Jiang Chi thought of his younger brother, his eyes would be filled with anger, but he couldn’t help but feel his heart ache. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Since his younger brother was no longer around, as his older brother, he naturally had to fulfill his younger brother’s wish.

At the thought of this, Jiang Chi replied to Qi Qi.

Lu Qi had thought that the other party might not reply and was about to sleep. When she saw an email coming in, she was excited.

!!

She sat in front of the computer, staring unblinkingly at the small red dot.

What should she do?

She wanted to open it, but she was afraid that the other party would reject her suggestion.

But if she didn’t look, what if she missed Mr. Jiang’s answer?

Lu Qi hesitated for a long time. In the end, she opened the email with a trembling hand.

When she opened it, her pupils involuntarily dilated.

[When you answer all the questions correctly, I’ll meet you.]

Lu Qi’s lips curved up in excitement. She jumped up in excitement, her face instantly turning red. She covered her face with both hands and threw herself onto the bed.

This was great. She could finally meet her idol!

When the time came, she would definitely take a photo with her idol.

Her idol was very likely to be over fifty years old. Even so, she felt that her idol would definitely be the most handsome!

When the time came, she would definitely learn from her idol.

…

When Qiao Nian woke up, it was already ten in the afternoon. There were still messages from Qiao Yu on her phone.

She woke up late!

She had agreed to pay respects to Grandma Qiao today. It seemed that she could only go in the afternoon.

Qiao Nian replied to Qiao Yu and put her phone away.

Now that she was the only one left in the room, it seemed that Gu Zhou had woken up long ago.

When she came out of the bathroom after washing up, footsteps came from outside.

At this moment, the bedroom door opened!

Qiao Nian was about to greet Gu Zhou when her legs gave way and she almost fell to the ground.

There was nothing more awkward than this!

Qiao Nian quickly grabbed the door frame to avoid kneeling down.

Gu Zhou walked forward and picked Qiao Nian up in his arms, placing her on the bed. He said gently, “I went to buy medicine for you just now.”

What f*cking medicine?

Qiao Nian really wanted to complain.

However, Gu Zhou didn’t seem to hear Qiao Nian’s thoughts. He placed the medicine on the bedside table and said, “Your lips are a little swollen. I bought lip balm.”

Qiao Nian: Didn’t you bite me?

With that, Gu Zhou glanced at Qiao Nian’s lips with a complicated expression.

Although her lips were a little red and swollen, when he thought of the taste of her lips last night, Gu Zhou swallowed. What if he wanted to kiss her again?

Qiao Nian had wanted to see what else Gu Zhou had bought. Seeing that he was staring at her, she frowned and said, “Why are you looking at me?”

Gu Zhou retracted his gaze with a complicated expression and took out a second item from the plastic bag. “These are vitamins!”

Qiao Nian frowned slightly and asked in confusion, “I don’t need to take vitamins now, right?”

“You didn’t sleep last night. You must have been especially tired. Take some vitamins to nourish your body!” Gu Zhou said seriously, looking at Qiao Nian with heartache.

Qiao Nian was instantly speechless.

When Gu Zhou said these words, his expression was very serious. He did not seem to be joking at all.

What else could she say?

Actually, it was all Gu Zhou’s fault. If he had restrained himself last night, she wouldn’t have had to work so hard!

Then, Gu Zhou took out a medicine box from the bag.

When Qiao Nian saw the words on the medicine box, her expression instantly darkened.

Golden voice!

She was all too familiar with this medicine!

That time, in Room 1314, she went to the pharmacy to buy golden voice the next morning when her throat was hoarse!

This matter was very awkward to say!

When she went to buy golden voice herself, she didn’t think there was anything wrong.

However, when Gu Zhou helped her buy golden voice, she felt that something was wrong. She felt as if she was about to die.

Gu Zhou placed the things he had bought on the bedside table and said considerately, “I just bought this. You should be able to use it!”

Qiao Nian lowered her head in silence.

Gu Zhou’s gaze gradually moved to Qiao Nian’s legs. He asked hesitantly, “What medicine should you take if your legs are weak?”
