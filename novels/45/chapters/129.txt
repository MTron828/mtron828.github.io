Chapter 130 Invitation

At this point in time, Qiao Xin had already stopped crying. Although she was also very angry, she still bowed respectfully to everyone before following Su Yan out of the room. Qiao Nian watched as the two of them left, her lips curving up slightly.

Who the hell did Su Yan think he was? How could he have thought that he had a chance to work with Director Lin?

If Qiao Nian wanted something, she would never let anyone else have it.

Just like that pot of Suranne Grass. She would rather ruin it than let Qiao Xin have it. She refused to let Qiao Xin take advantage of her in any way.

The grand opening ceremony began.

As the new director of the research institute, Qiao Nian, as well as Gu Zhou, who represented the third-party collaborator, stepped onto the stage. The firecrackers that followed were a perfect conclusion to the farce just now.

Just like that, the opening ceremony came to a close. Qiao Nian glanced at the time and was about to leave when she was stopped by an old man.

“Miss Qiao Nian, please wait for a moment.” An old man walked up to Qiao Nian and stopped her!

Qiao Nian turned to look at the old man. She had a good impression of him.

Previously, when everyone was criticizing Qiao Nian relentlessly, only this old man had refrained from attacking her personally, despite his doubts about her.

“Sir, may I help you?” Qiao Nian asked with a smile.

“I’m the dean of the Second Academy of Medicine. Our school will be holding a lecture soon, and I would like to invite Miss Qiao Nian to be a lecturer. Would Second Young Mistress Qiao be free?” The old man said with a genteel smile.

The Second Academy of Medicine was a famous university. It was ranked second in the country, and was also well-known internationally.

No wonder this old gentleman was completely different from the other onlookers. He was actually the world-famous Director Chen.

Qiao Nian hurriedly extended her hand and said politely, “Director Chen, it’s an honor to meet you.”

After a brief exchange of pleasantries, Director Chen asked, “Miss Qiao, may I ask if you have the time to give a lecture to the graduate students of our hospital this year?”

Qiao Nian suddenly recalled that Jiang Yue seemed to be a student from the Second Academy of Medicine.

Those who had the opportunity to give a lecture at the Second Academy of Medicine would be mostly top students who had graduated from that university, and most of them would go on to become big shots in the field.

For Director Chen to invite her to be a lecturer was a sincere affirmation of her medical skills, and a supreme honor.

Although Qiao Nian didn’t really care about the opinions of the public, it wasn’t appropriate for her to decline Director Chen’s invitation, especially when it came directly from the great man himself. Smiling, she said, “Thank you for your invitation, Director Chen. I’ll definitely be there!”

“I should be the one thanking you!”

Qiao Nian smiled and said, “Director Chen, you’re too polite!”

Qiao Nian spoke a few more words to Director Chen before walking out.

Qiao Nian had just walked out of the research institute when Chen Qing, who had been waiting by the side, chased after her. “Madam.”

Qiao Nian stopped and turned to look at Chen Qing

“Will you be returning to the Gu family villa?” Chen Qing asked respectfully.

Qiao Nian nodded, humming in assent.

“Then I’ll send you back first!” Chen Qing said.

“What about him?” Qiao Nian asked.

Chen Qing explained, “Second Young Master still has some things to discuss with Director Lin. He asked me to send you home first!”

Qiao Nian turned around and looked at the hall in the distance. She saw Director Lin talking to Gu Zhou. Both men had smiles on their faces. It seemed that they would be able to come to an agreement regarding the contract on medical equipment very soon.

Gu Zhou seemed to sense something. He looked up, gazing in Qiao Nian’s direction. Their eyes met. Gu Zhou’s eyes were like two bottomless pools of water. His gaze was arresting.

Qiao Nian quickly looked away, turning to look at Chen Qing instead. Pretending to be calm, she said, “Alright, let’s go!”

Qiao Nian had woken up early today. After getting into the car, she closed her eyes to rest.

After she had rested for a short while, her phone suddenly began to ring.

Qiao Nian didn’t even bother opening her eyes. With her eyes still closed, she picked up the phone and said lazily, “Who is it?” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“You wretched girl! Get back here, right now!”

Su Xue’s hysterical roar came through the phone.
