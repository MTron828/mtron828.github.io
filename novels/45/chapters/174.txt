Chapter 175 Blessing Bag

Wang Miao had specially gotten someone to help her with her makeup today. She looked much more exquisite than usual.

However, Wang Miao in light makeup was still hardly comparable to Qiao Nian without makeup.

Gu Zhou looked at Wang Miao with a dark expression, frowning. “What is it?”

Wang Miao took two steps forward, then took out the item she had been hiding behind her. She handed it to Gu Zhou and looked at him expectantly.

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on Wang Miao’s open palm. There he saw a pink blessing bag with lotus flowers embroidered on it. There was a faint scent of agarwood wafting from it.

Seeing Gu Zhou staring at her, Wang Miao couldn’t help but blush. She said shyly, “Second Young Master, I’ve specially made this blessing pouch for you. It’s even been placed in front of Buddha for forty-nine days(1). It… it can ensure your safety and your health. I hope you can accept it!”

Towards the end, Wang Miao’s face turned bright red. She didn’t even dare to look up at Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou did not take Wang Miao’s blessing bag. The coldness in his eyes was obvious. His voice was extremely frigid. “Is that so?” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Wang Miao was extremely nervous. When she heard Gu Zhou’s words, she thought that Gu Zhou had understood her good intentions. She said shyly, “Yes!”

“Aren’t you afraid of tainting Buddha’s eyes?”

Wang Miao froze. It was as if someone had poured a bucket of cold water over her head, chilling her to the bone. She looked at Gu Zhou in confusion, blinking her beautiful eyes in a puzzled manner. After a beat, she began to feel wronged.

“Second Young Master, actually, I…”

As Wang Miao spoke, she deliberately exposed her hand. On her fingers were quite a number of scars, caused by sewing needles. She had accidentally injured herself many times when she was making the blessing bag.

Naturally, Gu Zhou could tell what Wang Miao’s intentions were. His expression darkened. “If this happens again, get lost!”

Wang Miao looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief, growing anxious. She said pitifully, “Second Young Master, don’t chase me away. I just wanted to help you a little. I really didn’t have any other intentions. I…”

Wang Miao felt a little guilty under Gu Zhou’s gaze. She could not finish her sentence.

Gu Zhou looked at Wang Miao coldly. If it weren’t for Wang Lin, he would never have kept a person like Wang Miao around in the Gu family villa. That was because he felt guilty towards Wang Lin.

If Wang Miao knew what was good for her, she would do her job quietly and obediently.

In a panic, Wang Miao looked anxiously at Gu Zhou. Worried that Gu Zhou would chase her out, she quickly said, “Second Young Master, don’t be angry. If you’re unhappy, I won’t make you any more blessing bags. I’ll make whatever you like!”

Gu Zhou looked at Wang Miao coldly. His voice deceptively light, he asked, “Are you asking if you have a chance to marry me?”

Wang Miao’s heart leaped to her throat. She looked at Gu Zhou in shock. She had never expected Gu Zhou to know what she was thinking, and to say it so bluntly.

How could one speak aloud a girl’s innermost thoughts just like that?

Wang Miao lowered her gaze shyly and said in a girlish, delicate voice, “Second Young Master, how can you say such things so bluntly? I… I’m not mentally prepared!”

Gu Zhou waited for Wang Miao to finish speaking, then said coldly, “Do you think any Tom, Dick, or Harry can replace Second Young Madam’s position?”

Wang Miao heard the sarcasm in Gu Zhou’s words. In an instant, her heart, which was filled with love and admiration, sank into the abyss. She looked at Gu Zhou in fear and unease.

“Just this once. This won’t happen again.”

Gu Zhou’s voice was like that of a demon from hell, frightening Wang Miao so much that her legs began to tremble uncontrollably. She watched as Gu Zhou turned around and left without hesitation.

Gu Zhou walked towards the stairs. For the past few years, he had been searching for the woman he had spent a night with. In the end, he finally managed to find Wang Lin, Wang Miao’s older sister.

Wang Lin had given birth to a child for him. He wanted to know more about what Wang Lin was like when she was alive. Wang Lin and Wang Miao were biological sisters. If Wang Miao acted like this, then Wang Lin…

At this moment, Gu Zhou felt that Wang Lin might not be the girl he had been looking for.

Wang Lin stood there with teary eyes, her tears falling uncontrollably. She was unable to hide the greed and infatuation in her gaze. However, she no longer dared to chase after him.
