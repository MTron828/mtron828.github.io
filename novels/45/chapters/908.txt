909 Funeral Home

The next morning, sunlight filtered through the curtains and fell on the bed. Xiao Shi slowly opened her eyes.

Later on, she actually dreamed that she was playing at the amusement park. In her dream, she was having a good time with her brother.

However, after waking up, she thought of Song Man again, and her eyes gradually dimmed.

Suddenly, she heard steady breathing in her ear. Her expression froze, and she suddenly realized that Mommy Nian Nian had been sleeping with her last night.

!!

When she realized this, Xiao Shi’s face turned red uncontrollably.

She turned to look at Mommy Nian Nian.

When Mommy Nian Nian slept, she was like an angel in a painting. Xiao Shi was stunned.

Qiao Nian’s biological clock woke her up. She opened her eyes and saw Xiao Shi lying beside her, staring unblinkingly at her.

Qiao Nian smiled and moved closer to Xiao Shi, planting a kiss on her forehead. “Good morning, Xiao Shi.”

“Morning…” Xiao Shi stammered, her big eyes flickering at Qiao Nian. “Mommy.”

Was this how it felt to have a mommy?

Was this how it felt to sleep with Mommy?

She felt so warm and safe.

Qiao Nian didn’t know what Xiao Shi was thinking. She tidied up briefly and helped Xiao Shi choose some good-looking clothes. After she was done, the two of them walked downstairs.

When they arrived at the living room, they saw Matriarch Gu and Gu Qi sitting on the sofa, chatting and laughing.

“Grandma.” Qiao Nian smiled at Matriarch Gu and greeted her. Seeing Matriarch Gu nod, she smiled and greeted, “Xiao Qi.”

“Mommy.” Gu Qi greeted her with a smile. His gaze landed on Xiao Shi’s face, and a trace of worry flashed in his eyes.

“Great-grandmother and Brother Xiao Qi.” After greeting her, Xiao Shi looked around but did not see Gu Zhou. A trace of confusion flashed in her eyes as she asked, “Where did Daddy go?”

Matriarch Gu looked at Xiao Shi’s pale face. This child had suffered such a huge shock yesterday. How pitiful.

She stood up and walked to Xiao Shi. Holding her hand, she walked to the sofa and sat down. She said gently, “Your daddy has something on and went to the company early in the morning. Where does the little princess want to go to play today?”

A trace of disappointment flashed in Xiao Shi’s eyes. She had wanted her father to accompany her to see Song Man, but it seemed that she could only ask Mommy Nian Nian to accompany her.

“Mommy and I…” As Xiao Shi spoke, she turned back to look at Qiao Nian, then at Matriarch Gu again. “We want to visit Auntie Song!”

Hearing Xiao Shi’s words, Matriarch Gu and Gu Qi were stunned.

They hadn’t expected Xiao Shi to call Qiao Nian Mommy! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Gu Qi’s face was filled with smiles. He felt that his mommy was the best mommy in the world. Initially, he was worried that his sister was unwilling to let his mommy be her mommy. Now, it seemed that he was overthinking.

Gu Qi looked up at Qiao Nian and saw a gentle smile on her face. Every time he saw his mommy smile like this, he felt that the entire world had become better.

Gu Qi smiled and walked up to Qiao Nian. He looked up at her and said happily, “Mommy, that’s really great. You’re now the mommy of me and Xiao Shi!”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Qi’s words, she felt a little bitter. She gripped Gu Qi’s hand tightly.

She was the mother of two children to begin with. She had worked hard to give birth to them after ten months of pregnancy.

Xiao Shi sat on the sofa and looked at Gu Qi with sparkling eyes. She asked, “Brother, can you go with me? You’re an indomitable man. With you, I won’t be afraid of anything!”

Gu Qi turned to look at Xiao Shi and nodded. “Okay!”

Matriarch Gu, who was sitting on the sofa, couldn’t help but worry. She frowned slightly and asked worriedly, “How can that be? That place is so scary. You’re still young. It’s not appropriate for you to go there.”

Qiao Nian smiled and said, “I’ve already contacted the hospital just now. Song Man’s family has already arrived and cremated her. Song Man is in the funeral home now.”

When Matriarch Gu heard Qiao Nian’s words, her frown deepened. She was still worried. “The yin energy at the funeral parlor is too strong. Children are inexperienced. They’ll be easily frightened.”
