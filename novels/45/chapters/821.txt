822 Protecting Him

Qiao Nian recalled everything that had happened in the past and said, “Xiao Qi, don’t worry. With Mommy around in the future, Mommy will never let anyone bully you again!”

Gu Qi was touched. He nodded solemnly.

He believed Auntie Nian Nian’s words. Auntie Nian Nian would definitely protect him.

He had a mommy now.

!!

How blissful!

Fortunately, Auntie Nian Nian was willing to be his mommy.

Otherwise, he might just be a child without a mommy.

At this moment, Qiao Nian’s heart gradually began to race. She was so happy that she felt a little suffocated.

She had thought that she liked Gu Qi unilaterally, but she didn’t expect they liked each other mutually.

Gu Qi was actually healing her.

Perhaps in the eyes of others, the departure of her biological children did not affect her at all.

Only she knew that she had been missing those two children.

“Xiao Qi, thank you! Thank you for being my child!” Qiao Nian said excitedly.

Gu Qi didn’t speak. He just hugged Qiao Nian tightly. In his opinion, he should be the one thanking Auntie Nian Nian.

Auntie Nian Nian had been protecting and taking care of him, letting him feel the warmth of his mommy.

After a long while, Qiao Nian let go of Gu Qi and gently patted his head. She said gently, “Xiao Qi, let’s go home!”

When Gu Qi heard Qiao Nian’s words, his eyes were filled with smiles. He nodded seriously.

Home!

What a beautiful phrase.

In the past, he had hoped that his parents would be at home. Now, he had them both.

Qiao Nian drove towards the Gu family villa. Her heart was surging with emotions. Her dream had already come true. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

At this moment, Gu Qi looked at the door of the Dongjiang villa that was getting further and further away. He felt very sad.

Gu Qi thought of Xiao Shi again.

He had always thought that his mommy was a very gentle and kind woman. He thought she was also very patient with her children. She would never let her children suffer, just like Auntie Nian Nian had always treated him.

But now, Gu Qi knew how wrong he was.

Gu Qi’s frown deepened. He asked worriedly, “Mommy, if we leave now, will she be angry all the time? When Xiao Shi gets home, will she hit Xiao Shi?”

Qiao Nian’s heart gradually calmed down. Hearing Gu Qi’s words, she frowned.

Gu Qi’s words made sense.

That woman was like a lunatic. It was very likely that she would beat Xiao Shi up.

Gu Qi’s heart was on her side. After such a thing happened, Gu Qi was willing to leave with her, but it was different for Xiao Shi.

She had grown up with Song Man. No matter how Song Man treated her, according to her attitude from before, she still liked her a lot.

If she forcefully brought Xiao Shi out, not only would she be unhappy, but she would also be in the wrong. After all, she was not Xiao Shi’s mother.

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian fell into a dilemma.

There was no point in thinking too much about it. Qiao Nian decided to call Xiao Shi and hear her thoughts.

Before making the call, Qiao Nian asked Gu Qi for his thoughts and asked, “Why don’t we call Xiao Shi and see what she thinks?”

“Okay.” Gu Qi nodded. After some thought, he said, “But don’t tell Xiao Shi that I was beaten up. I don’t want her to be sad.”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Qi’s words, she felt a little upset.

Gu Qi and Xiao Shi were only five-year-old children, but the two of them were really too sensible.

Some adults liked sensible children.

However, children should live carefree lives to begin with. If they were too sensible, it could only mean that they were living a hard life.

Qiao Nian sincerely hoped that these two children could live happily like ordinary children. They wouldn’t think too much about things, nor would they become sensible so early.

Qiao Nian nodded and agreed. “Okay.”

Qiao Nian took out her phone and called Lin Tao.

Soon, Lin Tao picked up the phone.

“Sister Nian Nian, have you seen Xiao Qi? How’s the situation over there?”

When Qiao Nian thought of what she had seen when she entered the Dongjiang villa, her eyes darkened. She said calmly, “I’ve already brought Xiao Qi over!”
