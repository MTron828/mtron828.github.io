Chapter 123 Soul Questioning

Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

Song Hua’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face and he snorted. “Qiao Xin has always kept in mind that you’re her older sister, so she has always tolerated you, but you can’t go too

far. You can’t keep bullying her just because she’s kind. If you don’t apologize to her today, don’t even think about leaving this place!”

Everyone looked at Qiao Xin sympathetically. They all believed that Qiao Xin often gave in to Qiao Nian at home as well.

Qiao Xin wiped her tears with a tissue and said gently, “Uncle Song, it’s good that the truth of this matter has already come to light. Please don’t blame Sister. She didn’t do

it on purpose.”

In the eyes of the crowd, Qiao Xin looked extremely pitiful. She was the younger sister, yet she had to be constantly magnanimous, and had to give in to her older sister,

Qiao Nian, all the time. This young lady was truly a kind and understanding soul!

In comparison, the crowd had no sympathy for Qiao Nian. She snatched her sister’s belongings all the time. She was simply inhumane!

“Qiao Nian, apologize to Miss Qiao Xin!”

“Qiao Nian, apologize quickly. You shouldn’t have bullied Miss Qiao Xin. You’ve ruined Director Lin’s opening ceremony!”

“Qiao Nian, if you still have a shred of humanity left in you, hurry up and kneel down to apologize!”

Hearing the criticizing words of the people around her, Qiao Nian raised her eyebrows slightly and asked, “Do any of you know how Suranne Grass is cultivated? Do you

know the environmental conditions required for it to germinate? How can you all be sure that the pot Qiao Xin was carrying in that photograph contained Suranne Grass?”

Everyone was stunned speechless for a moment. None of them had anything to say in response to the three questions Qiao Nian had fired out. However, they quickly

regained their footing. Qiao Nian was clearly resorting to sophistry!

“Qiao Nian, don’t even think about trying to free yourself from your wrongdoings. This is clearly your fault!”

“Youre still refusing to tell the truth, even now.”

“Does Qiao Nian have no sense of propriety at all? She’s simply a hopeless case. How can a person like her come to Director Lin’s opening ceremony?”

Song Hua smiled coldly, his gaze falling on Qiao Nian’s face. He questioned, “In that case, tell me: how did you cultivate the Suranne Grass?”

Qiao Nian looked at Qiao Xin and questioned, “How about you tell us how you cultivated the Suranne Grass?”

Qiao Xin’s eyes darted to the side. Pretending to be aggrieved, she said, “Sister, you were there when I was cultivating the Suranne Grass. Don’t you remember?”

“I have no idea how you cultivated Suranne Grass,” Qiao Nian said expressionlessly.

Indeed, Qiao Xin didn’t know how this pot of Suranne Grass had been cultivated. She had found the method of cultivation on Baidu. “Sister, I’ve just told you how I cultivated

Suranne Grass!”

“Qiao Xin, don’t tell me you truly believe that Suranne Grass can be cultivated so easily!” Qiao Nian laughed scornfully. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“You…”

Without hesitation, Qiao Nian cut Qiao Xin off and continued, “Suranne Grass is so valuable because it doesn’t have any seeds. Apart from loosening the soil to increase

porosity, and adding fertilizer, sesame seeds must also be mixed into the soil. Moreover, Suranne Grass is grown from the grafting of two different plants. Every morning,

the morning dew has to be collected before the newly grown grass roots are buried in the soil. Then, it needs to be watered with ginseng water and the collected dew. It has

to remain in a dark room at a constant temperature. In another half a month, the first sign of Suranne Grass will appear.”

Qiao Nian paused for a moment, then looked at the people around her and continued, “Just relying on ginseng water and morning dew is not enough to provide nutrients

for Suranne Grass. During this period, it needs to be watered with the blood of scorpions. The growth cycle of Suranne Grass takes about three years. This pot of Suranne

Grass only grew its leaves last week.”

“You… you’re spouting nonsense,” Qiao Xin said in a panic.

“If 1 remember correctly, ten years ago, botanists determined that Suranne Grass had gone extinct. Since it’s already extinct, where did you find the seeds?”

Qiao Nian looked at Qiao Xin intently and continued, “If you could find seeds of Suranne Grass, that means that there’ll be more Suranne Grass at that place. Then, in that

case, I’m sure you’ll have more with you. Just take out a few more stalks of Suranne Grass for everyone to see!”.
