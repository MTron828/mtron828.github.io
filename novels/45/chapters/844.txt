845 Admitting

Look at who had been surrounding Matriarch Gu for the past two days.

They would see who had taken the chance to poison Matriarch Gu.

However, Qiao Nian really hadn’t expected Gu Zhou to be able to confirm the culprit in such a short time. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

If it were her, she might only be certain of a few suspects.

“Butler, call the police,” Gu Zhou said indifferently.

When the butler heard Gu Zhou’s words, he was about to agree when someone ran out of the crowd.

That person knelt on the ground and kept kowtowing to Old Madam Gu.

That person was none other than Xiao Feng, who had been taking care of Old Madam Gu’s daily life.

Xiao Feng was 27 years old this year. She was originally from the orphanage. When she was studying part-time in university, she met Matriarch Gu.

When Matriarch Gu heard that Xiao Feng’s life was difficult, she wanted to help this young child.

The Gu family needed many servants to begin with, so Matriarch Gu let Xiao Feng in to work.

Xiao Feng’s job was not complicated. Every day, she would help Matriarch Gu tidy up her wardrobe, prepare a car according to Matriarch Gu’s needs, and accompany her on her trip.

After Xiao Feng graduated, she naturally stayed in the Gu family villa.

When Matriarch Gu saw Xiao Feng crying, she was stunned. She had never expected Xiao Feng to be the one who poisoned her.

“Why… why did you do this?” Matriarch Gu tried hard to suppress the anger in her heart. Xiao Feng’s grades were very good, and in the eyes of teachers and classmates, she was a good student.

She used to think that Xiao Feng was an obedient and adorable child, which was why she was willing to help her.

Matriarch Gu had never expected Xiao Feng to poison her.

When Xiao Feng heard Matriarch Gu’s words, she looked at her with teary eyes and said tearfully, “Matriarch Gu, it’s all my fault. I was blinded by greed. Please forgive me this once. I won’t dare to do it again!”

“Why?” Matriarch Gu’s expression instantly turned cold.

Matriarch Gu just couldn’t understand. She helped Xiao Feng study, and Xiao Feng worked in the Gu family villa. Her monthly salary was several times higher than elsewhere.

Xiao Feng was young and knowledgeable. Matriarch Gu often gave Xiao Feng some gifts, such as perfume and bags.

However, Matriarch Gu had never expected Xiao Feng to do such a crazy thing to her.

Even if Xiao Feng wasn’t grateful to her, she shouldn’t have poisoned her, right?

Matriarch Gu looked at Xiao Feng in disappointment.

Gu Zhou glanced at Xiao Feng coldly. Actually, he had felt that two of them were suspicious just now, but he had yet to confirm who they were, so he had only fired a shot.

When he saw that it was Xiao Feng, his eyes turned cold.

Xiao Feng had been specially brought in by Matriarch Gu.

Just because of this, Gu Zhou gave Xiao Feng a higher salary than others.

Another ingrate.

Qiao Nian sat where she was. Her gaze fell on Xiao Feng’s face. For some reason, she felt that Xiao Feng looked familiar. She seemed to have seen her somewhere before.

Where had she seen her before?

“I’m sorry, I’m really sorry. It’s all my fault. It’s my fault.” Xiao Feng kowtowed to Matriarch Gu in tears. With teary eyes, she said, “Previously, I heard from someone that this medicine could help Matriarch Gu recover, so I spent money to buy it back!”

Xiao Feng continued sobbing, “I often see Old Madam coughing in the middle of the night. That person told me that if Old Madam took the medicine, she wouldn’t cough again at night!”

Xiao Feng raised her hand to wipe her tears and said tearfully, “At that time, I saw many old people taking this medicine and recovering. They even specially sent gifts to the pharmacy, so I bought it for Old Madam!”

“Matriarch is so good to me. I have to repay her no matter what. I wanted to tell her about the medicine first, then ask her if she wanted to take this medicine.” Xiao Feng sniffled and said, “But that day, when I was delivering water to Matriarch, I wanted to give her a pill first and see how effective it was!”
