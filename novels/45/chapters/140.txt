Chapter 141 Get Out of the Car

Hearing Qiao Shan’s words, Su Xue couldn’t help but smile. She seemed to have forgotten all about the pain.

That’s right. Her eldest son, Qiao Yu, was the most promising child in their family.

As long as Qiao Yu returned home, Qiao Nian wouldn’t be able to act high and mighty for long.

Su Xue had suffered at Qiao Nian’s hands today, and had lost her dignity. No matter what, she would get Qiao Yu to make Qiao Nian pay for what she had done, a thousand times over.

Qiao Nian sat in the back seat of the car. She stole a glance at Gu Zhou, who was sitting next to her.

To be honest, she was not used to Gu Zhou treating her so well. The change was so sudden.

At this moment, Gu Zhou was sitting with his legs crossed. His eyes were closed, and his fingers were toying with the ring on his thumb, as if he was musing about something. Even though Gu Zhou’s eyes were closed, the aura around him did not weaken in the least.

Gu Zhou’s face was a masterpiece. His features seemed to have been crafted in the heavens. No matter the angle from which one looked at him, one would not be able to take their eyes off him.

Qiao Nian gazed unblinkingly at Gu Zhou, momentarily dazed.

Gu Zhou’s brow furrowed slightly. His eyelashes moved, and he opened his eyes fully.

“Why are you staring at me like that?” Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian, his eyes darkening a shade.

Qiao Nian froze. Gu Zhou had his eyes closed the entire time. How did he know that she was staring at him?

Qiao Nian coughed awkwardly in an attempt to hide her embarrassment. The tips of her ears gradually turned pink. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Gu Zhou realized that Qiao Nian was embarrassed. He couldn’t help but smile. “Mrs. Gu, you don’t have to peek so secretively at me. You’re my lawfully wedded wife. You can look at me whenever you want. If you wish, you can stare at me all day.”

Qiao Nian smiled slightly and said, “You seem to be in a good mood today.” “Yes,” Gu Zhou answered lightly.

Now, Gu Zhou no longer gave off that cold hostility. Instead, he gave off a gentle aura.

Qiao Nian recalled how Gu Zhou had protected her in front of the Qiao family just now. Her heart began to race, and for some reason, her mouth felt dry.

“Thank you for just now,” Qiao Nian said with utmost sincerity.

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Gu Zhou frowned. For some reason, he felt a little displeased.

Gu Zhou’s eyes gradually turned cold. He stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian, enunciating each word clearly as he spoke. “Mrs. Gu, you are my wife and the Young Madam of the Gu family. There’s no need to draw the line between us so clearly. Don’t thank me again.” Qiao Nian had always known that Gu Zhou was helping her for the sake of the dignity of the Gu family. But even so, she was still very grateful to Gu Zhou.

Because other than her grandfather, Gu Zhou was the only man who had ever protected her.

Qiao Nian’s beautiful eyes were filled with stars. She looked at Gu Zhou earnestly. “I understand, but I still want to thank you.”

Gu Zhou’s good mood instantly vanished. His entire body emitted a cold aura, and his voice turned frigid. “Stop the car.”

Chen Qing looked around and said carefully, “The sky is already dark, and we’re still far from the city. What if we encounter bandits?”

Gu Zhou’s expression darkened. His eyes were like two jet-black pools of ink, containing not even a trace of light. “Stop the car!”

Chen Qing looked up carefully. Through the rearview mirror, he took in the two people sitting in the backseat.

Second Young Master Gu, who could frighten anyone to the point where they would become a trembling mess. Young Madam Gu, who could beat the shit out of anyone. Indeed, neither of them would be worried about the possibility of bandits.

Chen Qing hesitated for a moment. Sensing the oppressive aura Gu Zhou was exuding, he silently parked the car by the road.

“Get out of the car!” Gu Zhou’s voice was as cold as ice.

Chen Qing’s hands, which were holding onto the steering wheel, trembled slightly. Second Young Master Gu had taken such good care of Madam just now. Gu Zhou’s words were probably directed at him.

“Then… then should I get out first?” Chen Qing probed carefully.

“Stay seated.”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She turned to look at Gu Zhou and saw his dark expression. Did Gu Zhou want her to get out of the car?

Gu Zhou had clearly been in a good mood just now. Why had his mood changed for the worse so quickly?

“You! Get out of the car!” Gu Zhou turned to look at Qiao Nian with narrowed eyes.

Chen Qing: “??!!!”

Qiao Nian: “?”
