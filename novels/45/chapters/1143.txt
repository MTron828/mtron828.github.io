Chapter 1144: Unbelievable

Although Qiao Nian’s voice was soft, her voice was like a bomb that exploded in Su Yan’s mind.

At this moment, Su Yan’s mind was in a mess. The only thing she could feel was that the person she was hugging was real!

“Nian Nian.” Su Yan hugged Qiao Nian tightly, tears welling up in her eyes. She slowly closed her eyes.

She didn’t dare to let go of Qiao Nian, afraid that she would disappear in the next moment. She was also afraid that all of this was a dream. When she woke up, her Nian Nian would stop at three years old.

Qiao Nian’s eyes were also red. She didn’t dare to speak again, afraid that her tears would fall.

At this moment, a servant walked over and said respectfully, “Madam, Young Masters, Misses, and Young Master Zhou, the food is ready. You can eat now.” Su Yan came back to her senses. She raised her hand to wipe the tears from the corner of her eye and let go of Qiao Nian, staring unblinkingly at her.

Qiao Nian’s eyes followed her. They were clearly fox-like, but they were like peach blossoms. There were very few people with such eyes. When she was young, Nian Nian’s eyes were the same.

Qiao Nian’s nose was the same as Old Lu’s. It had a small hump in the middle, but a small hump didn’t make her look ugly. Instead, she looked sexy.

“You’re so similar to when you were young. You’re simply carved from the same mold.” Su Yan raised her hand and touched Qiao Nian’s face. She still remembered Sugar’s little face when she was three years old. It was chubby and felt especially good to the touch, but Sugar had already grown up now. The baby fat gradually disappeared from her face. “Sugar, I’m sorry. It’s Mom’s fault. Mom didn’t look for you earlier!”

Su Yan held Qiao Nian’s hand tightly, looking guilty.

Qiao Nian shook her head and said, “Mom, it’s not your fault. Don’t blame yourself.”

Gu Zhou stood at the side and heaved a sigh of relief. It seemed that there was no need for a paternity test report. Auntie Su had already believed that Qiao Nian was the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

Seeing her mother hugging Qiao Nian, Lu Qi couldn’t help but tear up. She raised her hand to wipe her tears.

That was great. Her sister had returned home. Mom would never have to be sad again!

Lu Zhu looked at Qiao Nian’s red eyes and nose, like a little white rabbit. He recalled everything that had happened in MY and couldn’t help but smile.

Fortunately, he had agreed to go to MY back then. Otherwise, he might never have had a chance to find Sugar. This might have been their family’s misfortune.

Lu Nian looked at Qiao Nian, his eyes filled with relief. He still remembered his surprise when he found out that Qiao Nian was Sugar. He really hadn’t expected Sugar to still be alive.

Lu Jiang looked at Qiao Nian with a complicated expression. As a brother, he didn’t seem to have hugged his sister before. He had to find a chance to hug his sister later!

Lu Rao was not sad at all. He smiled and asked, “Mom, Sugar is back. Are you happy?”

When Su Yan heard Lu Rao’s words, she glanced at her sons at the side, then at Qiao Nian. She was even more certain that what had just happened was not a dream.

She had always thought that her Sugar had died when she was three years old.

In the past, she had even fantasized that if she saw a girl who looked exactly like Sugar in her next life, she would definitely take good care of that child, because that child was her Sugar’s reincarnation. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

She had also thought that when Sugar returned home, she would definitely tell her daughter everything that had happened in the past. But now, she couldn’t say anything.

“Come, you must be starving. Come, let’s eat.” Holding Qiao Nian’s hand, Su Yan walked towards the cafeteria.

In a daze, Su Yan seemed to have returned to more than twenty years ago. At that time, she was holding Sugar’s hand and had to bend down.

Sitting at the dining table, Su Yan asked Qiao Nian to sit beside her and kept picking up food for her. When the small plate in front of Qiao Nian was filled with food, her eyes grew redder and redder. She couldn’t help but say, “Sugar, Mom is very happy.”

“Mom, I’ve missed you all these years too.”

“I know.” Su Yan looked at Qiao Nian, who was beside her. She still felt as if she was dreaming. Even if she was dreaming, she was still happy. “This is also the first time Mom has seen you as a grown up. You were still so young in the past. I didn’t expect you to marry Gu Zhou in my dream..”
