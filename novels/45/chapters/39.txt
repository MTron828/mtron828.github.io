Chapter 40: Murderer!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Shen Xing glared at Qiao Nian angrily. She was almost misled by Qiao Nian. She thought it was Qiao Xin who wanted to harm her. Now that she thought about it, if Qiao Xin had wanted to harm her, why would she use the same perfume as her?

“Qiao Nian, you’re clearly the one who gave me the lust drug, yet you still want to implicate others. You’re truly shameless!” Shen Xing yelled in exasperation. Previously, she had heard Qiao Xin mention how awful Qiao Nian was. “You killed your good friend and made my sister disappear. Do you think no one knows what you’ve done?”

Shen Ming was slightly taken aback by Shen Xing’s words. He asked in astonishment, “Xing Xing, what did you say? Are you talking about Shen Yue?”

“Dad, Sister went missing because of Qiao Nian!”

As soon as Shen Xing’s words fell, chaos erupted.

Everyone looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief. They never thought that this little-known young girl would have so many tricks up her sleeve.

“Where is Shen Yue?” Shen Ming’s eyes had turned red, and he was panting heavily. Shen Yue was his most beloved daughter.

Five years ago, Shen Yue had disappeared. He had been searching everywhere but could not find her!

“Miss Shen, I don’t know what you’re talking about. I didn’t kill anyone, and I didn’t kidnap your sister.” Qiao Nian paused, took out her cell phone and played a video.

The video was of Sun Jiu and Shen Xing trying to harm her.

Qiao Nian looked at the clothes not far away and continued, “Miss Shen, I’ve only given you a slight dose of a coma-inducing drug. There’s definitely some on the outside of your clothes, but the inside of your gown is stained with a lot of lust powder. As long as the police come, they’ll know if I’m right!”

When Butler Shen heard Qiao Nian’s words, he immediately walked to the clothes and sniffed. Then, he nodded at Shen Ming.

“Miss Shen, I only gave you the drug in self-defense. The drug I’ve given you only lasts for a minute, and it will only make you dizzy for a little while,” Qiao Nian said expressionlessly. “The thing that really made you lose your mind was the lust drug in your clothes. I don’t have any enmity with you, and it’s impossible for me to get to your gown before the banquet to add the lust drug. Someone should already have sprinkled it on your gown before you wore it.”

The moment her words fell, everyone got excited.

Qiao Nian’s rebuke was truly amazing.

Gu Zhou gave Qiao Nian an approving look and nodded slightly.

Shen Xing looked at Qiao Nian in frustration. Her face was flushed red as she said angrily, “Since you knew that there was a lust drug in my clothes, why didn’t you tell me?”

Qiao Nian shook her phone and said innocently, “Miss Shen, you wanted to beat me to death with a stick. What should I say to you? I’m not interested in saving someone who wants to kill me!”

Shen Ming was on the verge of collapse. Although his daughter was framed, Shen Xing had already angered the Gu family. He was worried that…

“Enough!” Matriarch Shen snapped. She glared fiercely at Shen Xing. Shen Xing was not as obedient and sensible as Shen Yue. “Miss Qiao, I would like to ask if you know where Shen Yue is?”

When Shen Ming heard Matriarch Shen’s question, he looked toward Qiao Nian in anticipation. He said, “We’ve been looking for Shen Yue for five years, but we couldn’t find her. She met you before she disappeared!”

Five years?

Gu Zhou, who had been standing at the side, frowned imperceptibly. He had previously investigated what happened five years ago and found out that Li Chun and Shen Yue had disappeared.

He had thought that what happened five years ago was just between the two of them, but when he found out that the jade pendant was in Qiao Xin’s hands, he didn’t dare to jump to conclusions. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I’m sorry, I’ve not seen her,” Qiao Nian said without hesitation.

Just then, everyone heard Qiao Xin’s scream of pain.

“Ah!”

“I’m going to strangle you to death!” Shen Xing clutched at Qiao Xin’s neck with both hands, glaring at her with a sinister expression. “I’m going to strangle you to death!”

Shen Xing’s terrifying appearance gave Shen Ming a shock. He stepped forward, slapped Shen Xing and said in a rage, “What are you doing?”

Shen Xing was bleeding at the corner of her mouth. She pointed at Qiao Nian and said furiously, “Five years ago, Qiao Nian strangled Li Chun to death like this. Then, she strangled my sister like this!”

At first, everyone had thought that this was just a simple incident of Shen Xing falling into someone’s trap. However, they did not expect Li Chun and Shen Yue to be involved. Shen Xing even accused Qiao Nian of being a murderer in front of everyone.

Shen Xing knew that everyone thought that she was a dirty rat that had crawled out of the gutter. All they felt towards her now was disgust and detestation.

But even if her reputation was ruined, she had to find her sister and seek justice for her!

Shen Xing stood up in tears and pointed at Qiao Nian as she sobbed. “It’s been five years. Sister and Li Chun have already disappeared for five years. Qiao Nian, you’re awful. If you didn’t kill them, how could they have vanished from the face of the earth?”

“You killed my sister. For that, I won’t let you off.. I’m telling you…” Before Shen Xing could finish her sentence, she blacked out and collapsed.
