Everyone had not yet fully absorbed the process of cultivating Suranne Grass. When they heard Qiao Nian’s words, they nodded thoughtfully.

If Suranne Grass was really grown with seeds, then Qiao Xin would definitely know where to find other stalks of Suranne Grass.

Everyone’s gaze fell on Qiao Xin’s face. They were curious where all the other Suranne Grass was.

When Song Hua heard Qiao Nian’s question, he frowned and said, “What nonsense were you spouting just now? Grafting, ginseng, and the blood of what? How could you

cultivate Suranne Grass with such a strange method?”

“Suranne Grass has always been a hybrid plant. It went extinct because of its exacting growth conditions.”

Qiao Nian didn’t even bother giving Song Hua a glance. Instead, she stared unblinkingly at Qiao Xin and continued, “If you insist that Suranne Grass is grown with seeds,

that means that its seeds aren’t poisonous. The roots of Suranne Grass won’t be poisonous either. Do you dare to remove the roots of Suranne Grass with your bare hands?”

Before Qiao Xin could speak, Qiao Nian continued, “Just a friendly reminder. The roots of the Suranne Grass are highly poisonous. If you touch it with your bare hands,

you’ll be instantly poisoned. The Suranne Grass will also die immediately!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Qiao Nian was so frightened that her face had turned completely pale. Swaying on the spot, she looked at Qiao Nian in fear and unease. “Don’t spout nonsense!”

“I’m not spouting nonsense. You just have to touch the roots of the Suranne Grass. If you’re poisoned, that means I’m right. If you’re not poisoned, that means you cultivated

this pot of Suranne Grass.” Qiao Nian looked at Qiao Xin, her voice deliberately provoking. Her entire body was radiating a frigid aura.

Sensing Qiao Nian’s aura, everyone was momentarily stunned. None of them dared to speak.

Qiao Xin was so anxious that cold sweat had broken out on her forehead. She didn’t dare to touch the roots, because she was really worried that she would be poisoned.

Qiao Xin found herself in a hard position. She had no way of backing down from this situation. If she continued to argue with Qiao Nian, she might give herself away. The

only solution was to leave.

After a moment of silence, Qiao Xin looked at Qiao Nian with tear-stained cheeks. “Sister, you’re spouting nonsense. I know you hate me. I’ve already given in to you. What

else do you want?”

With that, Qiao Xin walked towards the exit in tears.

“Has Qiao Nian said anything wrong?”

Gu Zhou, who had been silent all this while, suddenly spoke. His voice was very calm, but one could sense the coldness in it.

Qiao Xin stopped in her tracks, her mind blank. She looked at Gu Zhou in shock.

Everyone was also stunned. They had thought that Gu Zhou was here to confess his love to Qiao Xin, but they didn’t expect Gu Zhou to choose to believe in Qiao Nian.

Gu Zhou raised his eyebrow slightly, looking as if he wasn’t afraid of making a scene. His gaze was as sharp as a dagger as he glared at Qiao Xin with that pair of dark eyes,

his voice aggressive. “Or is Qiao Nian telling the truth? You clearly don’t dare to try. Are you planning to escape the scene?”

Qiao Xin was on the verge of breaking down. She didn’t dare to gamble with her life. Tears welled up in her eyes, and her expression grew uglier and uglier.

“Did Qiao Nian really cultivate the Suranne Grass?” An onlooker couldn’t help but ask.

“I’ve heard from others in the past about the methods of cultivation of Suranne Grass. Although I don’t know if Qiao Nian’s method of cultivation is right, I think there’s

something wrong with Qiao Xin’s expression!”

“That’s right, that’s right. If Qiao Xin was really the one who cultivated it, then she should know the Suranne Grass very well. Why wouldn’t she dare to try it?”

“Yes, that’s what I’m wondering about!”

“Could Qiao Xin be lying on purpose?”

Qiao Xin stood there uneasily, listening to the discussion. She was so anxious that her palms began to sweat.

She had never expected that within the space of ten minutes, everyone would start to side with Qiao Nian.

When Qiao Xin thought of how Qiao Nian had treated her so harshly, she hated Qiao Nian to the core. However, she didn’t dare to voice her hatred. In the end, she couldn’t

help but burst into tears!.
