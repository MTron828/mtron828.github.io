1084 This Is Unfair!

How could Qiao Nian have everything!

This wasn’t fair!

At this moment, the police officer walked up to Qiao Xin and handed her a document. In a stern voice, he said, “Qiao Xin, you’re suspected of hiring someone to rape, instigating a crime, and making obsence videos. This is an arrest warrant. Please come with us!”

“No, I didn’t do anything. You’re maligning me!” Qiao Xin shouted. She was innocent. She was the victim. “I’m the victim. How can I be involved in a rape case? Brother, let go of me quickly. I want to leave!”

The police officer stepped forward and cuffed Qiao Xin’s hands without hesitation!

“You have the right to remain silent, but every word you say will be turned into evidence in court!” the police officer said expressionlessly.

Qiao Xin looked at her cuffed hands and was about to go crazy. This was more painful than ruining her reputation!

This matter would become a stain on her that she would never be able to wash away for the rest of her life!

Not only that, but those videos were also a stain on her life.

Actually, if she hadn’t been arrested by the police, she could have used the troll army to clear her name and show that she was just a victim.

But with actual crimes, it was different!

This was because the facts of the crime proved that she was not the victim, but the perpetrator. Everyone knew that she had done those despicable things!

Perhaps some people might even realize that she had originally wanted to set someone up, but she had become the victim.

She had shot herself in the foot. Everyone would probably laugh at her and think that she was especially stupid.

Why had things turned out like this? nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

How could Qiao Nian reach the peak of her life?

Why did that man become Gu Zhou six years ago? Why did Gu Zhou married Qiao Nian?

What Qiao Xin couldn’t stand the most was that Qiao Nian stayed clean. She was the one covered in filth!

If she hadn’t run away from the marriage back then, she and Gu Zhou might have had a perfect love and a complete family!

She had ruined her happy life with her own hands!

Qiao Xin followed the police officer out step by step. Recalling everything that had happened in the past, it seemed that she was the one who made the first move every time!

She seemed to have suffered the consequences of her own actions and ended up in such a miserable state!

Qiao Xin walked out and looked up at Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou, who were not far away. Qiao Nian was holding onto Gu Zhou’s arm with an elegant and calm smile on her face, as if she was looking at a clown!

She was really indignant!

Why were the heavens so unfair?

She had worked so hard to get a good life, but Qiao Nian had stolen it!

The more Qiao Xin thought about it, the angrier she became. She glared at Qiao Nian with hatred written all over her face and shouted, “Qiao Nian, you b*tch. It’s all your fault. You’ve harmed me. You’ll die a horrible death!”

With that, Qiao Xin pounced on Qiao Nian!

However, before Qiao Xin could walk over, she was stopped by the police.

“Behave yourself. Don’t cause trouble!” The police officer said impatiently!

In the eyes of the police, Qiao Xin was truly too vicious. She had actually thought of such a vicious method to harm others!

Fortunately, the person Qiao Xin had set up wasn’t fooled!

However, Qiao Xin was really too unlucky. She had harmed herself. There was probably no one more stupid than her in this world!

Qiao Xin was escorted out by two police officers. Her gaze was fixed on Qiao Nian’s face the entire time. She couldn’t attack Qiao Nian, so she could only curse crazily, “Qiao Nian, you’ll die a horrible death. You’ve caused me so much trouble. I’ll definitely return it to you tenfold or a hundredfold in the future. Just you wait. When I come out, I’ll definitely kill you! I’ll drain your blood, cut you into pieces, and throw your flesh to a dog!”

Qiao Nian’s emotions didn’t fluctuate at all. She said lightly, “We’ll talk after you come out!”

Gu Zhou narrowed his phoenix-like eyes and looked at Qiao Xin with a complicated expression!

The police officer didn’t want to get embroiled in the feud between the rich and powerful. He dragged Qiao Xin out of the room. “Shut up. If you have anything to say, go back to the police station!”

Su Xue looked at Qiao Xin in despair. She had always treasured her dearly, but now, she was about to be taken away by the police. She cried and stepped forward to hold the police back, pleading pitifully, “Officer, did something go wrong? How can my daughter break the law?”
