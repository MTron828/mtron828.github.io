1031 Gift

“Grandma.” Smiling, Qiao Nian walked over to Matriarch Lu and reached out to support her.

When Matriarch Lu saw Qiao Nian, her eyes were filled with doting love. Her lips curved up involuntarily as she said lovingly, “Sugar, since you came home in a hurry, I didn’t prepare any gifts for you. Let me show you my private collection. Choose something you like. You can have anything you want!” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Lu Qi immediately walked over, her eyes shining. She smiled at Qiao Nian and said, “Sister, Grandma’s private collection is all good stuff. Don’t show mercy!”

When Matriarch Lu heard Lu Qi’s words, she couldn’t help but laugh out loud. “You’re really something. You make it sound as if I couldn’t bear to give you anything good in the past.”

!!

“Grandma, I didn’t say that. I was just telling Sister not to show mercy!” Lu Qi said with a smile.

When Matriarch Lu heard Lu Qi’s words, her smile grew even brighter.

Qiao Nian wanted to refuse, but when she thought about how it was Grandma’s kind intentions, she didn’t say so. She followed Grandma to the storeroom.

Matriarch Lu had a private storeroom. It was said that most of the things inside had been bought when she was young. Some had been given to her by her grandfather, and she had always treasured them.

When Qiao Nian looked at the items inside, she was stunned. Gold, silver, jewelry, jade, and antiques.

Matriarch Lu looked at the things inside and her lips curved up slightly. Every one of these things was very meaningful, representing her youth.

Qiao Nian really didn’t know how to choose. Her gaze fell on a painting and she smiled. “Grandma, I like that painting.”

When Matriarch Lu heard Qiao Nian’s words, she followed her gaze. When her gaze fell on the painting, the smile in her eyes grew more and more obvious.

She hurriedly got someone to take down the painting. Smiling at Qiao Nian, she said gently, “I drew this painting for you.”

This was a Chinese painting. It depicted a child lying on the garden lawn reading a book. There were a few dancing butterflies around her. Not far away, there was a fountain, and sparkling water droplets reflected a rainbow under the sunlight.

Matriarch Lu looked at the painting. Her eyes were slightly red, as if she was recalling the situation at that time. “Sugar, this is what you looked like when you were young. At that time, you liked to read and often played on the lawn. I was on the second floor at that time. After taking a photo, I drew this according to the photo.”

“I wanted to give it to you as a gift on your birthday, but not long after, you…” At this point, Madam Lu’s voice choked up. “But now, I finally have a chance to give it to you.”

“Thank you, Grandma,” Qiao Nian said with a smile.

“Take a look. Is there anything else you like?” Matriarch Lu smiled at Qiao Nian and asked gently.

Qiao Nian glanced around. In the end, she shook her head and said, “Grandma, thank you for your kindness. I appreciate it. I like this painting the most. I’ll be very happy with it.”

Seeing that Qiao Nian was unwilling to choose more, Matriarch Lu sighed helplessly. Feeling that Qiao Nian was shy, she took the initiative to choose more than ten pieces for her. She asked the servants to pack them up and send them to the Gu family villa later.

When Qiao Nian and Matriarch Lu came out of the storeroom, Lu Nian walked over. He was holding a piece of corn candy and handed it to Qiao Nian.

“Thank you, Second Brother.” Smiling, Qiao Nian took it, tore open the wrapping paper, and placed the candy in her mouth.

“Second Brother, do you still remember that Sugar liked to eat corn candy when she was young?” Matriarch Lu looked at Lu Nian in surprise. All these years, Lu Nian had never been willing to celebrate Sugar’s birthday. She had always thought that Lu Nian did not like Sugar.

Lu Nian smiled at Matriarch Lu, then looked at Qiao Nian and asked, “Sister Nian, do you have time now? I’ve written a new song.”

When Matriarch Lu heard Lu Nian’s words, she seemed to have returned to more than twenty years ago.

At that time, Lu Nian was already a slightly famous pianist. Every day, he did nothing other than play the piano. He was rarely mischievous and did not look like a child at all.

At that time, she was worried that Lu Nian had gone silly playing the piano.
