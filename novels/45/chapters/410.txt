Chapter 411: I’m Sorry

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Ouch…”

Gu Zhou let out a muffled groan. The pain instantly spread throughout his body, and cold sweat broke out on his forehead. Only then did he let go of her. His slender hands gripped the blanket at the side, as if this could relieve the pain that Qiao Nian had just caused him!

Qiao Nian’s eyes gradually lit up as she snapped out of her memories from five years ago.

The moonlight shone in through the curtains, and she could vaguely see Gu Zhou curled up in a ball on the bed.

Jesus!

What had she just done?

She seemed to have used all her strength and…

A trace of panic flashed across Qiao Nian’s face. She quickly turned on the wall lamp and looked at Gu Zhou, who was lying on the bed.

Gu Zhou’s brows were tightly knitted together, and the veins on his forehead and fingers bulged ferociously. His face was even paler than the snow-white bedsheets.

Gu Zhou’s slightly unbuttoned shirt still revealed his sexy collarbone, which was covered in sweat, giving off a sense of beauty after being bullied.

An ascetic demon!

This was the first time Qiao Nian had seen Gu Zhou like this. She looked at him fearfully.

Oh no!

Gu Zhou was about to be crippled!

He had just used his hand to soothe her back.

But what had she done?

Qiao Nian pursed her lips tightly, looking vexed. “I-I’m sorry. I thought…”

Before Qiao Nian could finish speaking, she suddenly realized that she had said something wrong. Gu Zhou hadn’t wanted to do anything to her just now!

It was all her imagination.

“You—”

Qiao Nian was about to speak again when she suddenly realized something and silently swallowed her words.

Did she have to ask him directly if his lower body was fine?

Could she ask about it?

Did she have to ask?

Seeing Gu Zhou like this..

Was it possible that he was fine?

Even if it were a normal person, with her strength just now, he definitely wouldn’t have been able to withstand it. Moreover, Gu Zhou’s body was weak!

Qiao Nian bent down and approached Gu Zhou. She saw that he was frowning, his long eyelashes trembling, and his eyelids slightly red.

“Does it still hurt?” Qiao Nian asked anxiously.

Upon hearing Qiao Nian’s voice, Gu Zhou slowly opened his eyes. His deep eyes seemed bottomless, as if he wanted to suck Qiao Nian in.

Before Qiao Nian could react, Gu Zhou grabbed her waist.

The world spun, and Qiao Nian was pinned under him.

Qiao Nian still wanted to move, but to her surprise, Gu Zhou’s long legs were already pressing against her legs. Gu Zhou held her hands above her head with one hand.

At this moment, Qiao Nian had no strength to resist.

With such a big movement, the bathrobe on Qiao Nian’s body had already loosened, revealing her fair and sexy collarbone. Her beautiful chest was faintly discernible as she breathed, looking extremely charming.

Gu Zhou’s phoenix eyes narrowed slightly, and his thin lips moved slightly. His voice was low, magnetic, and very dangerous. “Mrs. Gu, you’re too ruthless!”

Mrs. Gu?

Qiao Nian’s heart raced. Was Gu Zhou reminding her of her happiness for the rest of her life?

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou’s pale face and knew that he was definitely still in pain. If she resisted forcefully, Gu Zhou would probably be in even more pain.

It seemed that she could only give in.

Qiao Nian blinked her beautiful foxy eyes, filled with apology. “I’m sorry. I-I didn’t do it on purpose.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Her voice was very soft, like a feather gently brushing across Gu Zhou’s chest.

Gu Zhou looked at her charming eyes and finally let go. He raised his eyebrows slightly. “Mrs. Gu, has anyone ever said that you’re very suitable to be an actress!”

Qiao Nian tilted her head. She was slightly puzzled, but didn’t say anything.

After Gu Zhou moved away, she silently turned over and climbed out.

Gu Zhou leaned against the head of the bed, his face covered in sweat. It seemed that the pain had not subsided.

Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. She recalled what had just happened. It seemed that Gu Zhou had moved slightly at the critical moment.

At this thought, the guilt in her heart lessened a little.
