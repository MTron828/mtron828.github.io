842 Do You Remember?

Gu Zhou knew that he would let the girl from five years ago down if he thought this way.

However, they were all adults now. Everyone had their own lives. He could give that girl material compensation, but he would never be able to give her the position of Mrs. Gu.

After Qiao Nian finished speaking, she suddenly recalled something. “Do you think she only had her arm amputated after that incident?”

Gu Zhou pondered for a moment and continued, “Then do another paternity test for her?”

No matter what the truth was, he had to let the two children know who their biological mother was.

“Okay!” Qiao Nian agreed readily.

As soon as Qiao Nian finished speaking, she saw Gu Zhou’s deep gaze on her. With just one look, she almost fell into it.

Qiao Nian looked away and asked uncomfortably, “What’s wrong? Why are you looking at me like that?”

Gu Zhou looked in front of Qiao Nian. The two of them were so close that their faces were almost touching.

Qiao Nian could smell ambergris on Gu Zhou. This fragrance seemed to have a bewitching charm.

Silently, she moved back.

However, there was only so much space in the car. She had nowhere to hide.

Gu Zhou moved closer to Qiao Nian and looked at her deeply. His low and hoarse voice made one’s ears feel like they were about to get pregnant.

“Nian’er.”

Qiao Nian’s heart couldn’t help but race. Her eyelashes trembled. This form of address again.

Every time Gu Zhou called her that, she felt that the person in front of her was Gu Chuan.

If others called her that, she might find it especially mushy and think that the man was especially melodramatic.

However, not only did Gu Zhou not make her feel a trace of disgust when he called her that, but his voice was also low and sexy, with a hint of temptation. One could not help but be infatuated.

Fortunately, Gu Zhou was gentle and refined at this moment. He did not make her feel that Gu Chuan was in front of her, nor did he make her feel fear.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian calmly. At such a close distance, he could clearly see every fine hair on Qiao Nian’s face. Under the sunlight, it was as if she was covered in a layer of golden light.

At this moment, Qiao Nian frowned slightly. Her eyelashes were trembling, as if she was very nervous and afraid.

“Are you afraid of me?”

“No.” Qiao Nian shook her head, then said honestly, “But I can’t remember anything about what you told me before.”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he frowned.

That made sense. Some things were unforgettable to him, but not important to others.

Perhaps in Qiao Nian’s heart, that matter wasn’t important at all, so she wouldn’t remember it.

Qiao Nian frowned slightly. Her gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face and she said carefully, “I might not remember the past completely. Why don’t you tell me directly, or give me a small reminder? I might remember.”

Gu Zhou sat back down and looked at Qiao Nian calmly. Qiao Nian looked a little sincere, as if she wasn’t lying.

It was also possible that Qiao Nian was too young to remember that incident.

“Spirit Mountain, North Slope. At that time, you should only be six years old!”

Six years old. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Qiao Nian immediately grasped the point.

At that time, something big had indeed happened.

She had gone up the mountain with her grandfather to pick herbs. Her grandfather had gone elsewhere to pick herbs and asked her to wait for him.

At that time, she had seen a herb her grandfather needed, so she had climbed to the cliff to help him pick it. However, she had never expected that she would slip and almost fall.

Fortunately, Qiao Yu had appeared and saved her back then. Otherwise, she might have died long ago.

Only her grandfather and she knew about this. How did Gu Zhou know?

Qiao Nian’s heart was beating faster and faster. She looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief.

Gu Zhou frowned slightly. His beautiful phoenix-like eyes narrowed slightly as he asked, “Why are you looking at me like that? Do you remember now?”

Qiao Nian pursed her lips tightly. She looked at Gu Zhou’s god-like face. At this moment, Gu Zhou’s expression was serious, as if they were talking about something very important.
