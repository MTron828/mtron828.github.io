Seeing Qiao Nian’s shy expression, Gu Zhou smiled and asked again, “Do you want to go to the Dongjiang villa?”

“Yes.” Qiao Nian had no choice but to agree. She glared at Gu Zhou again.

A man who wanted sex was really terrifying. He thought about that kind of thing all day long!

Gu Zhou’s eyes were filled with smiles. He moved closer to Qiao Nian’s face and was about to kiss her, but Qiao Nian avoided him.

!!

Qiao Nian said sternly, “Stop fooling around. I’ve just packed up everything. I still have to go to the Lu family today. I don’t want to touch up my makeup anymore!”

Gu Zhou stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian’s lips. He licked his lips and moved closer to her.

Qiao Nian watched as Gu Zhou moved closer to her. She quickly understood what Gu Zhou meant.

“Stop fooling around!”

“You haven’t taken the initiative in a long time.”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. Why did she feel that Gu Zhou was acting spoiled?

During this period of time, she had indeed not taken the initiative much. After all, Gu Zhou was taking the initiative every moment. She just wanted to give each other some privacy.

Gu Zhou pointed at his mouth.

Qiao Nian knew that Gu Zhou wouldn’t stop until he achieved his goal. She pursed her lips and moved slightly closer to Gu Zhou.

Her heart was beating faster and faster, and she didn’t dare to look into Gu Zhou’s eyes.

The two of them had done everything. She had taken the initiative to kiss him, but now she was still extremely nervous.

Qiao Nian quickly moved closer to Gu Zhou’s lips. Just as she was about to leave, Gu Zhou grabbed the back of her head.

“Oh…”

Qiao Nian spoke instinctively, but she didn’t expect Gu Zhou to take advantage of her.

About ten minutes later, just as Qiao Nian was about to suffocate, Gu Zhou finally let go of her.

Qiao Nian was panting slightly. Her cheeks were flushed, and her lips were red and slightly swollen. She glared at Gu Zhou.

In Gu Zhou’s opinion, her glare was too charming.

“Nian’er, why are you looking at me like that?” Gu Zhou’s voice was low, like mellow red wine.

“I think after we move to the Dongjiang villa, I want to make three rules with you.” Qiao Nian paused for a moment and continued, “Otherwise, I won’t stay there.”

“Tell me.” Gu Zhou’s voice was low. He took Qiao Nian’s hand and gently pinched her slender fingers.

Qiao Nian’s eyes darted around cunningly before she said, “I won’t tell you now. I’ll tell you when we get there.”

Gu Zhou’s lips curved up slightly. He had already gotten what he wanted, so he did not intend to say anything else.

Seeing how happy Gu Zhou was, Qiao Nian frowned.

This man’s plan had succeeded. He didn’t even know how to hide it. At least, he didn’t look so happy on the surface.

Qiao Nian looked at the darkness in Gu Zhou’s eyes and said, “You definitely didn’t sleep well last night. Sleep at home today. I’ll go back to the Lu family alone.”

Gu Zhou shook his head.

“No.”

Gu Zhou’s expression turned serious. He said seriously, “I’ve already promised you. I won’t go back on my word.”

Qiao Nian stood up and saw Gu Zhou stand up. For some reason, this was the first time she felt the pressure coming from Gu Zhou.

Qiao Nian thought that Gu Zhou was also worried about her, so she nodded.

She walked out. She had just taken two steps when Gu Zhou walked over quickly.

Gu Zhou walked over to Qiao Nian and handed her his arm.

Qiao Nian glanced at Gu Zhou and her lips curved up slightly. She took Gu Zhou’s arm.

She still remembered the first time she had held Gu Zhou’s arm. At that time, he had been cold and distant.

She was only his wife in name.

At that time, Qiao Nian had never expected her to be so close to Gu Zhou.

She had never expected that they would fall in love.

When the two of them arrived at the dining room for dinner, Matriarch Gu and the two children were already sitting at the dining table.

“Daddy, Mommy!”

“Daddy, Mommy!”

Xiao Shi and Gu Qi called out.

Matriarch Gu smiled and invited the two of them to sit down. “Nian Nian, are you returning to the Lu family today?”

“Okay.” When Qiao Nian heard the words “Lu family”, she couldn’t help but feel nervous. “I’ll go over after eating.”
