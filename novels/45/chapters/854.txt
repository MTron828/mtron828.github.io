855 Thanking the Qiao Family

“How… how is this possible?” Qiao Xin’s face instantly turned pale. Her lips trembled as she looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief.

“To be honest, I should thank the Qiao family. If you hadn’t thrown me into the mountains so heartlessly, how would I have had such a good opportunity? I wouldn’t have made a comeback!” When Qiao Nian smiled, her fox-like eyes curved slightly, filled with mockery.

Qiao Nian’s words were like a bomb that exploded in Qiao Xin’s mind.

Qiao Xin felt dizzy from the explosion.

!!

She really hadn’t expected the Qiao family to help Qiao Nian by accident. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Qiao Nian had learned so much in the mountains.

Qiao Nian naturally knew what Qiao Xin was thinking. Seeing that Qiao Xin was breaking down more and more, she was overjoyed. Her red lips curved up lazily. “As the saying goes, good will be rewarded, and evil will be punished. It’s not that you haven’t got what you deserved, but the time hasn’t come. Now, it seems that the time for the Qiao family to fall has arrived!”

When Qiao Xin heard Qiao Nian’s words, it was as if she was looking at a hungry ghost. It was as if Qiao Nian wanted to pull her into hell. She was so frightened that she took a step back.

Qiao Nian couldn’t even be bothered to look at Qiao Xin. Without mercy, she knocked Qiao Xin’s shoulder away. In her high heels, she left elegantly and arrogantly.

After a long while, Qiao Xin came back to her senses. She turned to look in the direction Qiao Nian had left in. Looking at Qiao Nian’s retreating back, her eyes turned red uncontrollably.

She bit her lower lip, the smell of blood spreading in her mouth. Her face was filled with hatred as she enunciated each word clearly. “Qiao Nian, just you wait. After Song Man acknowledges her ancestors, I want to see how long you can continue to be smug! You will get your retribution!”

There were many brothers in the Lu family. Now that Qiao Nian was with Gu Zhou, if Song Man returned, Qiao Nian would definitely lose her spot.

Qiao Xin recalled that she should be lying low and planning her revival.

She couldn’t be impatient. She had to wait patiently. She had to pull Qiao Nian down from a high place and make her step into the mud.

She wanted to destroy everything Qiao Nian had.

In the private room.

Qiao Yu sat there with his head lowered. Thinking of Qiao Nian’s gaze just now, his face turned a little pale.

His chest felt terrible, as if he was being bitten by millions of ants.

He had to think of that night’s call. If he had received that call back then, would he and Qiao Nian have been able to be together?

The person he cared about the most had always been Qiao Nian.

He remembered every detail of his time with Qiao Nian.

Spirit Mountain was not far from An City. In the past, he would often find all kinds of excuses to go out, then take a car to Spirit Mountain to secretly visit Qiao Nian during the weekends.

Every time, he would secretly observe Qiao Nian because he didn’t dare to meet her directly. He was worried that that lively and adorable little girl would blame his family for sending her to the mountains.

He was also worried that Qiao Nian would be angry with him over this matter and dislike him, her brother.

Every time he saw Qiao Nian smile happily at others, he couldn’t help but fantasize about Qiao Nian smiling at him.

When Qiao Nian was young, she was very cute, like a child from a comic book.

He really cared about her.

Yearning was like a seed that had taken root in his heart. His desire to see Qiao Nian grew more and more urgent.

He didn’t want to keep sneaking glances at her. He wanted to talk to her. He wanted to chat with her. He wanted to see her smile brightly at him.

Hence, he found an excuse to get lost in the mountains and walked to where Qiao Nian lived.

When he stepped into the small courtyard, his gaze inadvertently fell on Qiao Nian, who was squatting on the ground and planting flowers.

Holding a small hoe in her hand, she tied her hair back and planted the flowers seriously.

At this moment, Qiao Nian also noticed him. She stopped what she was doing and looked at him.

Qiao Yu would always remember that moment. At that time, his heart was beating violently, as if it was about to jump out of his chest.

His palms were covered in sweat as he looked at Qiao Nian nervously.

Qiao Nian was like a little angel who had accidentally fallen into the mortal world. Under the sunlight, her entire body was covered in golden light.
