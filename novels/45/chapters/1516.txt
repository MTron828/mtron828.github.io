1517 Gratitude

Annie was taken away by the soldiers in a sorry state.

The President watched as Annie left. Thinking of how he had personally harmed his Madam all these years, he felt a little suffocated.

The president was breathing heavily. His gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. Just as he was about to discuss Madam’s condition with Qiao Nian, his vision suddenly darkened and he lost consciousness.

“Dad!”

Lina shouted loudly and hurriedly helped the president up. The people standing not far away also hurriedly helped the president up and sent him to the room next to Madam President.

The palace was instantly in chaos.

At this moment, the only person who could stabilize the morale of the army was Lina. Lina got someone to close the palace, and soon, the palace returned to its usual calm.

…

An hour later.

Lina gave the president the Chinese medicine Qiao Nian had prepared for him. She put down the bowl of medicine in his hand and looked at the president worriedly.

Lina thought of her unconscious mother in the room next door and sighed helplessly.

In the past, she had heard from her father that her mother had become like this because of the aftereffects of an accident when she gave birth to her.

All these years, in order to treat his mother, his father had searched for famous doctors. In the end, he finally confirmed that the Falling Autumn Grass could stabilize his mother’s condition.

However, they had never expected the Falling Autumn Grass to be a scam. It was Uncle Mark’s method to obtain the throne.

She could not accept this. Her father, who had always loved her mother deeply, would definitely not be able to accept this.

Nian Nian said that her father had fainted because his blood was surging.

Lina walked out of the room with red-rimmed eyes. Seeing Qiao Nian sitting alone in a pavilion not far away, she walked over.

Seeing Lina walk over, Qiao Nian sat down beside her and asked, “Has the president finished his medicine?”

Lina’s eyes were wet. She nodded and looked at Qiao Nian uneasily. “Nian Nian, is my father really fine? Will he wake up for the banquet?”

Qiao Nian reached out and held Lina’s hand. With a serious expression, she said, “Of course. The president is just exhausted. After taking the medicine and resting, he’ll be fine.”

Lina sensed the warmth of Qiao Nian’s palm, which made her feel at ease. She heaved a sigh of relief. Her gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face and she asked uneasily, “Nian Nian, you went in with my father to treat my mother’s illness. How’s my mother’s health now? Do you have a solution?”

“Madam President’s health requires a closer examination. I can’t make a direct judgment yet,” Qiao Nian said apologetically. “After the President wakes up, if he’s still willing to let me treat Madam President, I’ll only be able to confirm the diagnosis after I’ve done a full examination.”

Lina looked at Qiao Nian gratefully. If it weren’t for Qiao Nian, she wouldn’t know what to do.

Lina reached out and hugged Qiao Nian. Seeing Gu Zhou and Chen Qing walking over, she let go of Qiao Nian reluctantly.

Gu Zhou walked to the table and sat down. Chen Qing stood quietly beside Gu Zhou.

Lina gave Gu Zhou and Chen Qing a friendly smile. Only then did her gaze fall on Qiao Nian’s face. She asked uneasily, “Nian Nian, can you stay in the palace today? I’m worried about my father’s health…”

What Lina was most worried about was that after her father woke up, he would think about her mother again. If he fainted from anger again, then…

Qiao Nian could naturally understand Lin Na’s worry. She nodded and said, “Sure. If there’s anything, you can come to me directly.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Lina looked at Qiao Nian gratefully, then called the butler over and asked him to bring Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian to rest. She even asked them to specially prepare a scrumptious meal for Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian.

When everyone had left, Lina returned to the president’s room alone. She closed the door and realized that her legs were weak.

Too many things had happened today. When she thought of the Falling Autumn Grass Uncle Mark had sent over, she still had lingering fears.
