Chapter 367: Protecting His Sister

Song Yu quickly regained her composure. She smiled at Old Master Jiang Qi and said, “Old Master Jiang, please answer our questions!”

Old Master Jiang Qi stroked his beard and said, “I am humbled. About seven years ago, I was fortunate enough to see Mr. Huang Shi’s paintings. They were called Daylight at the End of the Night and Sunshine.”

A happy smile appeared on Old Master Jiang Qi’s face. He continued, “The strokes of those two paintings are gentle, but not sharp. Moreover, they were drawn on a unique piece of paper. Although the surface is smooth, there are horizontal patterns at the four corners. Moreover, Miss Song’s painting happened to use this kind of paper!”

At this point, Old Master Jiang Qi’s expression gradually became firm. “Although many people copy other people’s paintings, it’s impossible to find the same paper.”

After Old Master Jiang Qi finished speaking, the others became even angrier.

“Miss Qiao, shouldn’t you step forward and apologize!”

“Qiao Nian, you’ve gone too far. How dare you fool everyone with a fake on such an important occasion!”

“Qiao Nian, who gave you the guts? Do you know that today’s charity auction is for the children in the mountains? Now, you’ve ruined everything!”

“This is simply too unlucky!”

“If Mr. Qin Chuan finds out that you’ve donated a fake painting, he’ll definitely be furious!”

…

...

Qiao Yu frowned slightly. He pushed his glasses up his nose bridge and his gaze fell on Old Master Jiang Qi’s face. He asked, “Isn’t it a little too rash to judge the authenticity of this painting just from the paper?”

When everyone heard Qiao Yu’s words, they were slightly stunned. They had never expected Qiao Yu to speak up for Qiao Nian.

However, on second thought, everyone felt that this was quite normal. After all, Qiao Nian was his younger sister.

As an elder brother, it was understandable for him to believe in his younger sister.

Qiao Xin was slightly stunned. She hadn’t expected her brother to still believe Qiao Nian after Jiang Qi had said that Qiao Nian was lying.

Qiao Nian wasn’t surprised that Qiao Yu had spoken up for her. Her beautiful fox-like eyes narrowed slightly.

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on Qiao Yu’s face. For some reason, he recalled what Qiao Yu had said to him last time.

“You can still get a divorce after getting married, right?”

A trace of coldness appeared in Gu Zhou’s deep eyes.

Chen Qing, who was standing beside Gu Zhou, felt an inexplicable sense of oppression.

Second Master’s possessiveness rose again.

Old Master Jiang Qi frowned and said, “I’ve studied Mr. Huang Shi’s paintings, so I naturally know his style. Of course, I didn’t judge it based on just the paper. Mr. Qiao, I know that Miss Qiao Nian is your younger sister, but you can’t protect her like this.”

When Qiao Xin heard the second half of Mr. Jiang Qi’s sentence, she couldn’t help but frown. She glanced at Qiao Yu worriedly.

Qiao Yu’s expression was calm. He straightened his tie slightly and stuffed a hand into his pocket. “Mr. Jiang, I’m sure you’ve never seen Huang Shi in person. Since you haven’t seen him, don’t be so sure. Otherwise, your life’s glory might be ruined here.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Yu’s words sounded like a warning, but there was a heavy sense of oppression.

Jiang Qi couldn’t help but frown.

Qiao Nian clenched her fists tightly. Memories of the past kept replaying in her mind.

When the surrounding people heard Qiao Yu’s words, they began to discuss softly.

“I’ve always thought that Qiao Nian and the Qiao family were on bad terms. I didn’t expect Qiao Yu to be so protective of his sister.”

“The rumors are all fake. Didn’t they say that Young Master Gu would die soon? Look at Young Master Gu now. He doesn’t look sick at all.”
