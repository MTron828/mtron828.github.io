Chapter 162 Smart Young Lady

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned when she heard Qiao Yu’s voice, but she quickly regained her composure. She nodded and said, “Yes.”

Qiao Yu thought for a while more and asked, “Did he find his wife?”

“Yes.”

At this moment, a clear voice rang out from the side. “Was he happy because he saw his

wife?”

Qiao Nian looked over and saw Lu Q? looking at her excitedly.

Qiao Nian nodded slightly. “Yes.”

When Lu Qi heard Qiao Nian’s words, she was overjoyed.

Qiao Yu glanced at Lu Qi not far away and frowned slightly. He was very dissatisfied with Lu Qi’s interference. “Was he hurt by someone?”

Qiao Nian shook her head. “No.”

Qiao Xin, who was sitting beside Qiao Yu, looked at him anxiously. She was a little worried that the Suranne Grass would be snatched away by someone else.

Qiao Xin looked at Qiao Yu, who was deep in thought. She lowered her gaze slightly and began to think seriously as well, hoping that she could help Qiao Yu. However, her mind was in a mess, and she couldn’t think calmly at all.

While Qiao Yu and Lu Qi competed against each other, the others present also began to contemplate the riddle seriously. Many of them actively asked questions, but most received negative answers.

For the sake of Suranne Grass, many people even took out their phones to send the riddle to their friends, hoping that their friends would help them solve the riddle.

The tension in the venue was so thick that it could be cut with a knife.

Lu Qi’s eyes suddenly lit up. She asked, “Was he driving to find his wife?”

“Yes.” Qiao Nian nodded.

“Was his wife dead?” Lu Qi continued asking. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Yes.”

“Then there’s no murderer at the scene?” Lu Qi asked.

“Yes.”

Lu Qi’s eyes lit up. She hurriedly stood up and gave the answer in one breath. “This man’s wife should have disappeared, so the man was driving around looking for his wife. The stack of paper he placed in the front passenger seat should be copies of a missing person notice. If it were something like tissue paper or kitchen rolls, it wouldn’t be a stack of paper.”

“As the man drove through the countryside, he realized that he needed to use the toilet. That was why he took a piece of paper to the field. It must have been there that he saw his wife’s corpse. He was happy that he had found his wife, but heartbroken to find her dead. He was in such extreme sorrow that he committed suicide the next day.” After Lu Qi finished speaking, she looked at Qiao Nian nervously.

Qiao Nian’s beautiful fox-like eyes narrowed and her red lips curved up slightly. “Congratulations, you’re right. This pot of Suranne Grass will be given to you as a prize.”

Lu Qi covered her mouth in excitement. She was a little worried that she would shout out loud in joy.

After Lu Qi sat back down, she threw herself into Lu Zhu’s arms and said excitedly, “Brother, aren’t I amazing? I actually managed to give the correct answer!”

Lu Zhu saw how elated Lu Qi was, and the corner of his mouth curved up in gratification.

Qiao Xin, on the other hand, wasn’t in such a good mood. Seeing how happy Lu Qi was, her eyes darkened. This Suranne Grass should have been hers, but someone else had snatched it away.

But Qiao Xin didn’t dare to throw a tantrum. She had taken a liking to Lu Zhu. If she could marry Master Lu in the future, she would be Lu Qi’s sister-in-law…

Qiao Yu could tell that Qiao Xin was disappointed. Casually, he spoke, “I was a step too slow this time. What gift do you want? I’ll make it up to you.”

When Qiao Xin heard Qiao Yu’s words, her eyes lit up. However, she hadn’t thought of a present she wanted yet, so she said, “Then I’ll ask Brother for it when I’ve thought about it.”

“Sure.”

On the stage, Qiao Nian’s heart gradually settled back down. Deep down, she didn’t want Qiao Yu to get the Suranne Grass, because if Qiao Yu got his hands on it, he would definitely give it to Qiao Xin.

Fortunately, Qiao Yu didn’t manage to solve the riddle. Lu Qi was truly a smart young lady.
