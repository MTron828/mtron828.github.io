Chapter 1739 - 1739 At Her Feet

“You…”

Before Lina could finish speaking, Wright interrupted her. “If the president comes, the first person he’ll investigate should be your good friend. He brought so many people with him. These people don’t look like ordinary people. They look even more powerful than mercenaries.”

Wright coughed twice in pain, then supported himself against the wall and stood up. He stared unblinkingly at Gu Zhou. “In the face of national matters, our people will be united. We can’t let outsiders occupy our country!”

“Gu Zhou.” Wright paused and asked softly, “Did you bring these people here on behalf of the government of Country Z, or on your own?”

Lina paused for a moment. She understood what Wright meant.

When other countries invaded, everyone in the country should unite to resist foreign enemies.

Lina glanced at their outfits. It was obvious that they were organized and disciplined. Moreover, they were holding guns. If they didn’t handle today’s matter well, it would easily become an international incident.

She glanced at Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian. Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian had been protecting her and her family. She trusted her friends.

“Wright, don’t change the subject. We’re talking about you and me now,” Lina said sternly, frowning.

“About you and me?” Wright looked at Lina and couldn’t help but laugh. He shook his head gently. “Seventh Princess, the most important thing now is the identities of those people. Do you still want to protect them? Are you going to commit treason?”

Lina’s expression darkened, and she frowned.

Without waiting for Lina to speak, Wright seemed to have thought of something. Realization dawned on him and he clapped. “I understand. So the Seventh Princess has long been involved with the Gu family. However, this is a deal between the two of you. Does it also include the President?”

“Oh, why am I so stupid? The president treats Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian so well. How can he not be included?” Wright paused and questioned coldly, “Has the president already reached a consensus to give Europe to them?”

Lina’s face was pale. Wright was spouting nonsense. If others found out about this, her father would become a sinner in Europe.

Gu Zhou narrowed his eyes dangerously. Although Wright was extremely stupid, his ability to bite people was not bad. He took a step forward and blocked Wright’s view of Lina. He said coldly, “We’re just handling our private matters. As for the internal strife in your royal family, we’re not interested.”

Wright’s lips curved up slightly, his face filled with disdain. “Anyone can say pompous words, but in Europe, ordinary citizens are not qualified to hold guns. Are you trying to tell me that you’re deliberately challenging our European laws?”𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Chen Qing tried his best to stand up straight, not wanting to place his weight on Lina. Afraid that Lina wouldn’t be able to take it, he looked at Qiao Nian and said in a low voice, “I’m sorry, Young Madam. This is all my fault. If I could handle all of this well, you wouldn’t have to use Lin Mian’s people.”

Chen Qing’s eyes were filled with guilt. If he hadn’t walked into this dead end, he would have left Mark’s manor long ago. Why would he have asked Second Young Master and Second Young Madam to bring Lin Mian’s men over? “I’m just afraid that this matter will implicate Master.”

Qiao Nian naturally understood what Chen Qing was thinking. She said softly, “Chen Qing, you don’t have to think too much about it. Dad was willing to hand them over to me because he hoped that they could protect us. What happened today was an accident. If anything else happens in the future, they’ll come out too. They’re just here early.”

She really felt that there was no need for Chen Qing to feel guilty, because those people had come to help in the first place. She couldn’t let Chen Qing die just to hide their existence.

Moreover, if something more serious happened in the future, these people would appear again, so she really felt that it was very normal to expose her strength.

Last night, she caught up with her grandfather. Her grandfather wanted her to rest there for a night before leaving. However, she was worried about the situation here, so she booked a plane ticket and returned with Gu Zhou.

Fortunately, they had returned. Otherwise, Chen Qing would have…
