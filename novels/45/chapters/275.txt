Chapter 276: Completely Humiliated

Qiao Nian shook her head gently. The pearl earrings on her ears swayed, accentuating her fair face.

The students were all dumbfounded.

A beauty was indeed a beauty. With just a slight movement, she was so beautiful that one could not take their eyes off her.

Xia Xue noticed the gazes of her classmates and felt indignant. However, she still put on a gentle facade and said softly, “Everyone, don’t be anxious. I’ll go look for Mr. Dong Hua first and ask for his permission. If he’s willing to show his face, everyone will be able to see their idol.”

When the other students heard Xia Xue’s words, they were all extremely excited. They looked at Xia Xue with fawning expressions.

“Senior Xia Xue, you’re the best.”

“Senior Xia Xue, you’re indeed the prettiest girl in our faculty. You’re really a beautiful and kind little fairy!”

“Senior Xia Xue, I’ll always love you the most!”

…

Qiao Nian also looked harmless. She looked at Xia Xue expectantly and said gently, “I’ll have to trouble Senior Xia Xue to invite Mr. Dong Hua over.”

Wang Xuan, who was standing beside Qiao Nian, suddenly had a thought. Not only was Nian Nian talented in music, but she was also a natural actor!

Xia Xue gave Qiao Nian a meaningful look and nodded lightly. Bearing everyone’s expectations, she walked towards the erhu room near the piano room.

Walking to the door, she knocked tentatively.

Nothing happened inside.

Xia Xue turned back to look at her classmates. Seeing that their attention was all on her, she pursed her lips into a helpless smile and walked towards the next door.

Xia Xue knocked again.

There was still no reaction from inside.

Xia Xue had already knocked on two doors, but there was no movement at all. Could it be that Mr. Dong Hua didn’t want to see her, so he kept quiet? Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

However, in order to attract the attention of her classmates from Qiao Nian to her, she had said that she wanted to consult Mr. Dong Hua.

Some words could not be taken back so easily.

Xia Xue began to walk to the next door. She knocked three more times, but there was still no movement.

After that, Xia Xue knocked a few more times, but there was still no response.

When Xia Xue stood at the door of the last room, she pursed her lips and cleared her throat, asking obediently, “Excuse me, Mr. Dong Hua, are you there?”

When the onlookers heard Xia Xue’s question, they all held their breaths in excitement, their hearts beating faster and faster. They were so nervous that they didn’t dare to speak.

However, there was still no movement in the room.

The blood drained from Xia Xue’s face. She stood there awkwardly, unwilling to give up. She knocked again.

However, there was still no movement from behind the door.

“What’s going on?”

“Could it be that Mr. Dong Hua is deliberately putting on airs?”

“No way. Even if Mr. Dong Hua doesn’t want to see us, he just has to say the word.”

“That’s true. Senior Xia Xue is the female musician handpicked by Mr. Dong Hua. No matter what, Mr. Dong Hua will give Senior Xia Xue face!”

…

Xia Xue felt utterly humiliated.

As long as she participated in Mr. Dong Hua’s concert as a female musician, she would reach the pinnacle of her career. If the media knew about the training room issue, they would definitely say that she was not well-liked by Mr. Dong Hua.

Xia Xue clenched her fists tightly. A faint smile appeared on her face as she said gently, “Mr. Dong Hua, I’m really sorry for disturbing you.”

Xia Xue’s mind raced as she tried hard to weave her words. “The students admire you very much and are eager to meet you. Everyone wants a response from you, so I came to ask if it was convenient for you to come out. If not, I’ll tell everyone.”

Xia Xue waited for half a minute, but there was still no response.

Wang Xuan stood at the side and looked at Xia Xue’s humble and polite manner. She couldn’t help but laugh out loud. However, she knew that she was covering her laughter, so she didn’t alarm anyone.

If Xia Xue knew that the Mr. Dong Hua they were talking about was Nian Nian, would they break down?

She was looking forward to seeing the expression on Gao Lin’s face.
