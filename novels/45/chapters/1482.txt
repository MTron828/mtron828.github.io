1483 Guilt

Lina was already very worried about Qiao Nian, and she felt very guilty. Because of her, Qiao Nian had no choice but to be involved in the internal conflict of the royal family.

Lina recalled that when they left the mountain yesterday, Wright had forced Qiao Nian to hand her over. At that time, Wright’s subordinates were all pointing guns at Qiao Nian.

Even in such a dangerous situation, Qiao Nian was still concerned about her and asked for her opinion.

Lina held Qiao Nian’s hand tightly, her eyes red-rimmed. She was touched. Other than her parents, no one else would treat her so well.

Lina pursed her lips and took a deep breath before saying, “Nian Nian, don’t worry. Not only did my father change a batch of bodyguards for me, but there are also more than ten bodyguards protecting me in the dark. If I’m in danger, I can also protect you. I’ll definitely be able to protect you!”

When Lina said the last sentence, she sounded very certain, as if she was taking an oath.

Hearing Lina’s words, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but laugh. She nodded slightly and said, “Alright, I’ll leave my safety to you from now on!”

Lina nodded solemnly. Only then did she remember that Qiao Nian had just woken up. She hurriedly said, “Nian Nian, hurry up and go in for breakfast. Mr. Gu has already gone out with my father.”

Qiao Nian long realized that Gu Zhou had left. After what had happened at the door just now, if Gu Zhou was at home, he would definitely come out.

“Okay.”

Qiao Nian and Lina entered the kitchen to eat.

…

Wright sat in the car, his expression darkening. He asked the chauffeur to take him to the First Earl’s residence.

The First Earl’s residence was in the suburbs, because a castle could only be built in the suburbs.

The castle was resplendent, like a palace.

Wright got out of the car, briefly tidied his clothes, and walked in.

When he reached the entrance of the castle, he saw a servant walking out. He asked, “Where is the earl?”

“Your Highness, the Earl is at the racecourse now.” The servant lowered his head and said respectfully.

“Ok.” Wright turned and walked towards the racecourse.

When he first reached the racecourse, he saw the earl riding towards the stables. Seeing the earl’s slightly flushed face, he guessed that the earl must have finished the racecourse with his beloved horse.

The earl swiftly got off his horse and handed the reins to the servant. His gaze fell on Wright’s face not far away. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The First Earl, Mark, was the eldest brother of the president. He was wearing a riding suit and looked valiant and majestic. His face revealed a dignity that could not be ignored.

Mark frowned slightly, his voice cold.

Wright didn’t dare to look at Mark’s face at all now. He cowered and lowered her head.

Mark’s blue eyes stared indifferently at Wright’s face, his expression complicated.

Wright felt a sharp and cold gaze on him. He felt uncomfortable all over. Cold sweat broke out on his forehead in fear. He felt the air around him freeze, and even breathing became difficult.

Mark gripped the whip in his hand tightly and whipped Wright without hesitation, as if he was hitting a horse’s butt.

Wright’s clothes instantly split open. The skin and flesh where Mark’s whip had hit him split open, and blood seeped out.

He had just lost his balance and staggered to the ground.

At this moment, Wright couldn’t care less about the pain in his body. He immediately stood there obediently, lowering his head and not daring to speak.

Mark looked at Wright indifferently. In the end, he threw the whip in his hand into Wright’s hand. “Clean up your mess yourself!”

Wright gripped the horsewhip in his hand tightly and bent down ninety degrees. He said respectfully, “I understand, Father.”

Mark walked towards the castle, leaving Wright behind.

A gust of wind blew past, and Wright felt the spot he had been hit hurt terribly.

He quickly walked to the stable, casually threw the horsewhip to a servant, and left quickly alone.

As soon as Wright returned to his room, he slammed the door shut and kicked a bookshelf.
