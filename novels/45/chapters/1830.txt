Qiao Nian instantly understood what Lu Qi meant. She hurriedly changed the topic. “Alright, breakfast is almost ready. Let’s go eat. I’m a little hungry.” The few of them walked towards the dining table, chatting and laughing.

Gu Zhou was the first to notice Qiao Nian coming down the stairs. Before he could say anything more to her, he saw that Qiao Nian had already been escorted to the dining hall by everyone. He could only watch her from afar.

Fortunately, the three babies were by his side. Smiling, he brought them to the dining hall.

The servants of the Lu family were all handpicked. Moreover, they had undergone special training. All of them were thorough and efficient, and no one could find any fault with them.

The food on the dining table emitted a fragrance.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Su Yan didn’t know what Qiao Nian liked to eat, and she was too embarrassed to ask directly, so she got the servants to prepare different dishes. This time, because everyone in the Lu family was present, and the entire family was reunited, this breakfast was very sumptuous.

When everyone sat at the dining table, Gu Zhou finally had a chance to sit down beside Qiao Nian. He was still carrying Xiao Shi in his arms. He looked at Qiao Nian beside him, his dark eyes like dazzling obsidian. ‘1 1 didn’t see you when I went to the hospital.”

Hearing Gu Zhou’s words, Qiao Nian smiled in embarrassment. Last night, she had planned to go to the Gu family with Eldest Senior Brother, but she recalled that Eldest Senior Brother wanted to see Xiao Bao. The two of them decided to go to the Lu family on the way to the Gu family. After that, she forgot to send Gu Zhou a message.

Qiao Nian gave an apologetic and delicate smile and said in a voice that only the two of them could hear, “l just got back. There are too many things to do.”

“So you forgot about me?” Gu Zhou went along with Qiao Nian’s words and helped her set up her chopsticks.

“How could that be? I just forgot to send you a message.” Qiao Nian would never admit that she had forgotten about Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou lowered his gaze. His long eyelashes covered his dark eyes, making it impossible to tell what he was thinking. “Is that so?”

That light voice was mixed with a hint of danger.

“Of… of course.” Seeing Gu Zhou’s gentle actions, Qiao Nian felt a chill run down her spine. Her hands clenched involuntarily under the table.

“Then what rank am I in your heart?” Gu Zhou looked up at Qiao Nian and asked seriously.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but sit up straight. She had never thought of this question, but Gu Zhou looked so serious, as if he wanted to get to the bottom of it.

Gu Zhou could tell that Qiao Nian was nervous. His lips curved up slightly. “It’s rare for you to be together with your family. Eat well. Think about this carefully. I hope I can hear an answer I like tonight…”

The others were also chatting and laughing. Some people noticed Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian’s actions. They subconsciously thought that the loving couple was whispering.

Others might not be able to hear what Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian were saying, but Xiao Shi could hear them clearly. She could tell that her mommy was a little nervous. Puzzled, she looked up at Gu Zhou and said in a childish voice, “Daddy, your words are so strange.”

“How is it strange?” When Gu Zhou looked at Xiao Shi, his voice was very gentle and there was no trace of oppression.

Xiao Shi hugged Gu Zhou and said softly, “What you just said seems to make Mommy uncomfortable. Do you want Mommy to answer according to what you want? Everyone has their own thoughts. How can you force others to listen to you?”

When Qiao Nian heard Xiao Shi’s words, she lowered her head and kissed her cheek. There was a hint of a smile in her beautiful fox-like eyes. “Xiao Shi, actually, adults sometimes joke around casually. Your Daddy is just joking.”

Xiao Shi tilted her head and asked in confusion, “Daddy, if you don’t like the answer Mommy gives, are you going to punish her?”

In the past, when Xiao Shi was with Song Man, as long as she did not go along with her wishes, Song Man would punish her.

At the thought of this, Xiao Shi frowned..
