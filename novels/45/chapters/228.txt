Chapter 229: Untitled

The cleaning lady, who had been working tirelessly, finally noticed that there was a man in the corner. Looking up, she was stunned.

This man was even prettier than a woman!

Under the sunlight, the man’s skin was as fair as white jade. Yet, he didn’t exude any femininity at all. Instead, he looked like an elegant gentleman.

He had sharp eyebrows, bright eyes, a high nose bridge, and a pair of beautiful phoenix-like eyes.

She couldn’t take her eyes off him.

This man was not old. He looked to be in his mid-twenties.

Strange, was he a student of the university?

If so, how could she not remember him?

People who were good-looking in the music stream were definitely well-known among the staff and students. She should have known.

“Auntie,” the man greeted.

The cleaning lady was slightly stunned. Her heart began to race involuntarily. Why did this man’s voice sound so pleasant?

In the words of the girls in school, listening to this voice could make one’s ears pregnant.

“Huh? What is it?” The cleaning lady looked at the man in confusion.

“Did the student who just left play the violin here?”

The cleaning lady took a moment to react. “I only saw her playing the lute. I don’t know anything else.”

“Then do you know the name of that student?”

“Xia Xue!” The cleaning lady said with certainty. Of course she knew Xia Xue. Not only did she know Xia Xue, but she also knew all the outstanding students in school.

The man lowered his gaze slightly, his long eyelashes hiding the light in his eyes. He repeated in a low voice, “Xia Xue.”

The man looked up, then walked out.

The man had just walked to the door when a man with a small ponytail quickly walked over and grabbed his arm. “Mr. Donghua, why are you here? The concert is starting in a few days. Can’t you come and help?”

Donghua’s gaze fell on the back of the girl not far away. Just as the girl turned a corner, she stepped into a window of sunlight. Bathed in sun, her entire body seemed to be enveloped in a golden glow. After turning the corner, she disappeared.

Donghua pushed his manager away indifferently and said with a calm expression, “Isn’t everything already arranged? What’s there to be anxious about, Brother Cao?”

Brother Cao looked at Dong Hua’s unhurried manner and said in a low voice, “I guessed right away that you didn’t know. The female violinist who had been arranged to play the violin has just taken leave because of something that happened at home. It’s impossible to find a suitable person in such a short time.”

When Donghua heard Brother Cao’s words, his eyes narrowed slightly. He turned to look at Brother Cao and said with a smile, “Don’t worry, that person is right here.”

Brother Cao looked at Donghua in confusion. The emperor was not anxious, but the eunuch was. “Where? There’s only the two of us here. Don’t tell me you’re expecting me to play the violin? I’m not that capable!”

Donghua pursed his lips and said, “Help me find a student.”

“Who are you looking for?”

“Xia Xue.”

When Brother Cao heard Donghua’s words, he looked at him in surprise and frowned slightly. “Donghua, why are you looking for a female student? By the way, don’t change the topic. We’re discussing the fact that you need a violinist.”

“I think she should be able to save the day,” Donghua said calmly.

“What?” Brother Cao’s eyes widened to the size of dinner plates. Then, his eyes filled with disdain as he said, “Donghua, wake up. Stop dreaming. What can a female student do? How can she be your supporting musician? Are you trying to embarrass yourself and ruin your reputation?”

Donghua glanced at Brother Cao indifferently and said, “She can definitely do it!”

Brother Cao pursed his lips in disapproval. “I don’t believe you!”

“Bring her here tomorrow.”

“Got it,” Brother Cao said coldly. He still didn’t trust that female student.
