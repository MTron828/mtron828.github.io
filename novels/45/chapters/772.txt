773 First Meeting with Daddy

She thought of her hands again. Her hands were covered in calluses, completely different from Auntie Nian Nian’s hands.

She still remembered that Sister Lingling used to wear a very beautiful dress. Then, she touched the dress. Her hands were too rough, so she caused Sister Lingling’s dress to become thready. At that time, she felt especially guilty.

At that time, Sister Lingling wasn’t angry with her. Instead, she was comforting her.

Seeing that Xiao Shi was sitting in the car and not getting out, Qiao Nian thought that he was shy. She smiled and comforted him. “Get out of the car. That way, you can see Daddy sooner!”

“Okay!” Xiao Shi replied and placed her hand in Auntie Nian Nian’s palm.

Qiao Nian held Xiao Shi’s hand. After Xiao Shi got out of the car, she casually closed the door and walked towards the Gu family’s door.

When Xiao Shi saw the door, she couldn’t help but gasp. She tried his best to pretend to be calm.

This door was so big. It was even bigger than the door of the school near their house.

At this moment, Xiao Shi was like a child, filled with curiosity about everything around her.

This place was simply too beautiful. She felt as if she had walked into a fairy tale book.

She could not believe that all of this was real.

She had never dared to have such a dream before.

The fountain in the garden was still spewing water. Although it was already autumn, many flowers were still in bloom.

Xiao Shi followed Qiao Nian into the living room. The first thing she saw was the woman sitting on the sofa.

Xiao Shi’s gaze fell on the woman’s face. She was wearing a pair of bamboo reading glasses. Before she came, her brother had already told her that she should be her Great-Grandma!

Xiao Shi smiled at Matriarch Gu and greeted, “Hello, Great-Grandma!”

When Matriarch Gu heard Xiao Shi’s voice, she immediately laughed. She looked at Xiao Shi dotingly. “Oh my, my darling child, you’re finally back!”

When he heard Matriarch Gu’s words, a sweet smile appeared on his face.

Just as Brother Xiao Qi had said, Great-Grandma was very gentle.

Qiao Nian, who was standing at the side, heaved a sigh of relief when she heard Xiao Shi deal with all of this so calmly. She no longer had to worry about Xiao Shi being exposed, because Xiao Shi was too smart. She wouldn’t give herself away.

At this moment, footsteps came from the stairs.

Qiao Nian looked up and saw Gu Zhou walking down the stairs.

He was wearing a white shirt and pants, and his right hand was in his pocket. His deep eyes were like a deep pool, making one unable to help but be immersed.

When Xiao Shi looked at the stairs, she saw a man walking down.

When she saw the man’s face, her heart began to race, as if it would jump out of her mouth in the next moment.

Oh my god, this person must be her daddy!

Her daddy was really too handsome.

He was even more handsome than those male celebrities.

Xiao Shi couldn’t believe what she was seeing. She rubbed her eyes.

There was really nothing wrong with her eyes.

Her daddy was too handsome!

Gu Zhou walked down the stairs. His gaze didn’t fall on Qiao Nian’s face. Instead, he frowned at Xiao Shi, who was standing beside her.

Xiao Shi saw Gu Zhou getting closer and closer, and her heart began to race. She hurriedly called out, “Daddy!”

A trace of confusion flashed in Gu Zhou’s eyes. Gu Qi usually called him Dad. Why had he changed the way he addressed him?

His gaze landed on Gu Qi. For some reason, he felt that Gu Qi was a little strange.

But he couldn’t tell what was strange.

Gu Qi seemed to have lost weight!

He hadn’t been so thin yesterday.

Gu Zhou’s expression instantly turned cold. He asked sternly, “Why did you skip class today? Don’t you know that you should go to school to study?” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Hearing Gu Zhou’s words, Matriarch Gu hurriedly walked over and smiled at Xiao Shi. She said gently, “Xiao Qi, children can’t skip class, understand?”

When she heard Matriarch Gu’s words, her beautiful fox-like eyes instantly filled with tears. She said pitifully, “Great-Grandma, I’m not feeling well today, so I didn’t want to go to school. I just want Auntie Nian Nian to accompany me!”
