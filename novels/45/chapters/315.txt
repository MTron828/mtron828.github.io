Chapter 316: Sneaking Away

At this moment, the nanny ran out. With a worried expression, she said anxiously, “Young Master, my Young Master, why did you run out by yourself?!”

The nanny sat at the side and helped Gu Qi put on a shirt. She said softly, “I told you to listen to Dad and stay at home to study. How could you sneak out? Fortunately, you’re fine. There are bad people everywhere. If you’re taken away by bad people, you’ll never see Dad again!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

When Gu Qi heard the nanny’s words, he lowered his head slightly and did not speak. His eyes gradually dimmed.

Seeing this, the nanny, Zhang Yi, couldn’t help but sigh. She looked up at Gu Zhou. “Mr. Gu, this child is really worrying. He doesn’t want to do his homework, and the tutor can’t do anything about him. What should we do now? This child is already four and a half years old. He often goes out, and he doesn’t have any sense of safety. What if he doesn’t have basic common sense in the future?”

Gu Zhou walked up to Gu Qi. Chen Qing hurriedly gave up his seat and Gu Zhou sat down. His voice softened. “Why didn’t you do your homework?”

“Daddy.” Gu Qi pursed his lips. After calling out, he lowered his head to look at the floor.

Seeing Gu Qi like this, Zhang Yi sneered.

This child was indeed mentally retarded. Other than knowing how to call for help, no matter how she hit or scolded him, he would not say anything, nor would he complain.

Taking care of a mentally retarded child and receiving a high salary, Zhang Yi felt that this job was really easy.

Zhang Yi couldn’t bear to leave this job behind. She said spontaneously, “Mr. Gu, I’ve been by Young Master’s side for a year. My relationship with him is also good. Although I’m just a university student, it’s easy for me to teach Young Master some kindergarten knowledge. I’ll help Young Master learn how to stand tall in society and not be bullied in the future.”

Seeing Gu Qi lower his head in silence, Gu Zhou nodded gently. “Little Zhang, it’s been hard on you.”

“What trouble? This child is so adorable. He’s so likable!” Zhang Yi said considerately.

Gu Zhou turned to look at Chen Qing and instructed, “Double her salary.”

......

Chen Qing answered expressionlessly, “Yes.”

Zhang Yi was overjoyed. She had only said it casually. She didn’t expect Gu Zhou to be willing to pay double the price. She had initially asked for 50,000 yuan a month. If she received twice that amount, wouldn’t that be 100,000 yuan?

If she earned more than a million yuan a year, wouldn’t she be rich and beautiful?

Zhang Yi’s gaze fell on Gu Qi again. It seemed that this little fool was really precious!

Zhang Yi believed that as long as she did a good job and made Gu Zhou think that this little fool could not leave her, she might be able to marry into the Gu family in the future.

Zhang Yi’s gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s handsome face, and she was overjoyed.

After Gu Zhou and Chen Qing left, Zhang Yi swiftly closed the door. She quickly ran to the window and heaved a sigh of relief when she saw that Gu Zhou’s car had already left the entrance.

Zhang Yi drew the curtains. The gentleness and kindness in her eyes disappeared, replaced by displeasure and coldness. She exuded a sinister aura as she walked towards Gu Qi.

“Have you grown up?” Zhang Yi walked up to Gu Qi and looked down at him. She scolded sternly, “I just slapped you. Do you have to run out? What, are you trying to kill me?”

The more Zhang Yi spoke, the angrier she became. She poked Gu Qi’s head with her index finger. “Little mute, you fool. Let me tell you, just because you’re disobedient, your grandmother doesn’t even visit you anymore. Your mother doesn’t want you, and your father doesn’t come often either. Only I’m kind and don’t despise you after taking care of you. You should be respectful to me, understand?”

Gu Qi nodded. When he lowered his head, his delicate brow furrowed.

Of course, Zhang Yi did not see Gu Qi’s expression. Now that she was satisfied after ranting, she looked much better. “Children have to be punished if they do anything wrong. Go and bring the fruit platter over from the kitchen.”
