1251 Nonsense

Gu Zhou kept looking around. His gaze inadvertently fell on the steel bullet beside Takeda. A trace of confusion flashed in his eyes as he walked towards him.

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on the back of Takeda’s right hand. The back of his hand seemed to have been hit by something hard, leaving a hole. He saw a steel bullet beside the back of Takeda’s hand.

He took the steel bullet and measured it against the back of Takeda’s hand. If he wasn’t wrong, it should be the steel bullet that hit the back of his hand.

Gu Zhou put the steel bullet into his pocket and walked towards Qiao Nian as if nothing had happened.

Seeing Gu Zhou put his arm around Qiao Nian’s shoulder again, Jiang Yue frowned and said coldly, “Gu Zhou, do you know why Qiao Nian pretended to be the eldest daughter of the Lu family?”

Gu Zhou looked at Jiang Yue expressionlessly, his eyes filled with displeasure. He frowned and did not speak.

Jiang Yue thought that Gu Zhou was already beginning to suspect Qiao Nian. She continued, “She must know that you were once engaged to the eldest daughter of the Lu family. In order to keep you firmly in her grasp, she even wanted to cheat the Lu family of their assets. That’s why she pretended to be the eldest daughter of the Lu family!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“How can you fall in love with a liar?” The more Jiang Yue spoke, the angrier she became. She stared at Qiao Nian carefully. Other than looking seductive, what else was so good about this woman? “She must have ulterior motives for marrying you. She must be lying to you!”

“Your imagination is really rich. Do you think the Gu and Lu families are all fools?” Boss Jin couldn’t take it anymore. He couldn’t stand the way Jiang Yue looked at Gu Zhou with affection. “Shut your mouth!”

Gu Zhou gave Jiang Yue a cold look, then looked at Boss Jin and said, “I’ll leave the rest to you.”

Boss Jin hurriedly nodded!

When Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian, his eyes instantly softened. “Let’s go!”

Qiao Nian gave Jiang Yue a meaningful look. She really hadn’t expected her to be so stupid.

“Okay!”

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian passed by Jiang Yue.

Jiang Yue gripped her bag tightly and lowered her gaze to hide the anger in her eyes. Carefully, she took out a dagger from her bag. Then, she looked at Qiao Nian sharply and wanted to stab the dagger into her heart without hesitation.

Jiang Yue studied medicine. She planned to stab Qiao Nian to death in one go.

Qiao Nian seemed to sense danger. She turned around and saw that the dagger was about to reach her.

At this moment, Gu Zhou was even faster than Qiao Nian. He grabbed Jiang Yue’s wrist with one hand and pushed her away without hesitation.

“Ah!!!”

Jiang Yue’s scream echoed throughout the living room. In the end, she fell to the ground in a sorry state, and the dagger in her hand stabbed into her left shoulder due to inertia.

Jiang Yue was in so much pain that her forehead was covered in sweat. Blood instantly stained her clothes red. She covered her wound with her other hand and cried, not daring to move.

When Jiang Yue heard Boss Jin’s words, she was overjoyed. Boss Jin must have felt sorry for her, so he wanted to attack Qiao Nian.

Jiang Yue looked at the bodyguards with teary eyes and said, “Hurry up and catch her!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she was picked up by the bodyguards.

The bodyguards’ actions were very rough, tugging at the wound on Jiang Yue’s shoulder. Jiang Yue’s face turned pale from the pain. Suppressing the pain, she said loudly, “You’ve caught the wrong person. Hurry up and catch Qiao Nian!”

Jiang Yue wanted to break free from the bodyguards, but they were holding her too tightly. She roared in exasperation, “Don’t you understand what I’m saying!”

Slap!

Boss Jin slapped Jiang Yue’s face, his eyes filled with hatred for her. Fortunately, Jiang Yue’s assassination didn’t succeed. If Jiang Yue really killed Qiao Nian, the Jin family would be gone!

Jiang Yue was such an idiot. Even now, she still thought that the person he wanted to catch was Qiao Nian.

She should take a look at herself.

Jiang Yue was stunned by Boss Jin’s slap. Tears streamed down her face. “How dare you hit me again?”

“I wish I could beat you to death right now!” Boss Jin said through gritted teeth.
