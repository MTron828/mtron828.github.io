1063 Awakening

She also wanted to be like Teacher Bai Hui and become someone who contributed to society!

She had worked hard in school, and her exam results were ranked first in the entire school!

The next year, her parents passed away because of AIDS. Her fifteen-year-old brother was unwilling to let her go to school again. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

School fees had to be paid. Her brother wanted to save money to build a new house and get married!

As their family was very poor, her brother could not find a wife. In the end, the matchmaker said that he was preparing for a marriage exchange

The so-called marriage exchange was that when she married into a man’s family, a girl from the man’s family would marry her brother.

But at that time, she no longer wanted to get married. She only wanted to study hard, get into university, and leave the mountains.

Just as she was forced to meet the man, Teacher Bai Hui appeared!

Teacher Bai Hui had always been cold. No one in the class dared to speak to her much. She often heard from others that Teacher Bai Hui had no emotions. She was like a machine!

Teacher Bai Hui only glanced at her and asked, “Do you want to study or get married?”

“Study!” Yu Chu said without hesitation. Saying these two words had already exhausted all her courage.

In the end, Teacher Bai Hui gave her brother two hundred yuan and brought her out of the mountain to the city.

At that time, Yu Chu realized that Teacher Bai Hui was just a person who was cold on the outside but warm on the inside.

When she lived with Teacher Bai Hui, it was at this time that she got to know Brother Ah Yue and Brother Ah Zhou.

She came from the countryside, and she had an accent. At that time, she was studying in the same school as Brother Ah Zhou, and Brother Ah Zhou had even threatened those who laughed at her.

Thinking of the past, Yu Chu couldn’t help but smile. If it weren’t for her teacher, she might not have so many happy and warm memories!

Not only had the teacher brought her out of the mountain, but he had also changed her fate.

However, there was something she didn’t understand. Why was her teacher so heartless to her two biological children?

Teacher was very strict with Brother Ah Zhou because she wanted Brother Ah Zhou to save Brother Ah Yue. However, Teacher did not treat Brother Ah Yue well either…

Once, Grandma Gu wanted to give Brother Ah Yue a candy. Just as Brother Ah Yue placed the candy in his mouth, the teacher forced him to open his mouth and spit it out. Then, the teacher threw the candy into the trash can.

“Do you have a conscience? Your brother is still suffering because of you. How dare you eat candy?”

Brother Ah Yue had only eaten half a bowl. When he didn’t want to eat, the teacher would be very angry.

“You’re not in good health. Why aren’t you eating? Do you want your brother to suffer more?”

When Brother Ah Yue was playing tennis at home, her teacher was so angry that his face darkened.

“Your brother can only lie on the bed because of you. How dare you play tennis casually? If you fall, do you still want your brother to suffer?”

…

Every word the teacher said was like a sharp blade stabbing into Brother Ah Yue’s heart. Brother Ah Yue’s expression grew uglier and uglier.

Yu Chu came back to her senses and looked at her teacher. Her teacher’s appearance was similar to before, but she was no longer as energetic as before.

“When did you start following me?” Bai Hui looked up at Yu Chu.

“I’ve been by Teacher’s side since I was ten!” Yu Chu said obediently.

Bai Hui looked at Yu Chu’s innocent little face, and her gaze gradually softened. “Chu Chu, you just told me that you liked someone. Tell me honestly, did you say that on purpose in front of Gu Zhou? Do you want me to give up trying to matchmake you with Gu Zhou in this way, or do you really like someone already?”

“Teacher, it’s true. I already have someone I like, and he’s already confessed his love for me. I wanted to tell Teacher about this before agreeing to be with him!” Yu Chu’s face was as red as a cooked shrimp, and her head seemed to be steaming.

Bai Hui frowned slightly and asked, “Do I know that boy?”

“Teacher should know him, but I want to bring him to see Teacher after everything is settled.” Yu Chu gave a quiet smile and said gently, “Teacher, I really don’t have that kind of feelings for Brother Ah Zhou!”
