Chapter 364: Unease

Qiao Xin couldn’t help but feel nervous. Her gaze fell on Qiao Yu’s face and she saw that he was staring at Qiao Nian.

Qiao Xin frowned slightly and called out softly, “Brother?”

When Qiao Yu heard Qiao Xin’s voice, he lowered his gaze slightly. “What’s wrong?”

Qiao Xin asked in a voice that only the two of them could hear, “Whose painting do you think is real?”

“Qiao Nian,” Qiao Yu said without hesitation.

When Qiao Xin heard Qiao Yu’s words, her breathing hitched. She saw that her brother spoke firmly, without any hesitation. It was as if her brother also knew the origin of this painting.

Qiao Xin’s uneasiness grew.

After a long while, Qiao Xin asked, “Brother, do you trust her that much?”

Qiao Yu didn’t speak. Instead, he looked away, his gaze falling on the stone wall painting on the stage.

This was not a matter of whether she believed him or not.

Moreover, this painting was in Qiao Nian’s hands to begin with. It could only belong to Qiao Nian.

At this moment, the organizer’s staff brought Qiao Nian’s stone painting onto the stage.

Most of the people present had already determined that Qiao Nian’s painting was a fake, so they couldn’t be bothered to look at it.

......

However, when they inadvertently looked over, they were instantly stunned.

If Qiao Nian’s painting was a fake, it would definitely be the most authentic fake in history.

Every detail in this painting was like a perfect copy and paste.

It seemed that if one wasn’t a veteran appraiser, one wouldn’t be able to tell which painting was the real deal.

“I really didn’t expect fake goods to be so realistic.”

“I think I’m going blind. Miss Song’s painting looks like the real deal, and so does Miss Qiao’s!”

“Let’s see what Madam Li has to say!”

Just like that, Qin Dong walked onto the stage step by step, carrying everyone’s hopes.

Qin Dong first checked Song Yu’s painting. Her hand touched it gently. The paper was extremely smooth as it was high-quality paper.

Qin Dong studied the scenery in the painting carefully.

When she looked carefully, she could sense the meaning behind the painting.

The stone wall painting was a famous banquet painting of An City. In the painting, the flowers of An City were blooming, looking magnificent. The people in the painting were trying hard to break free from their restraints, giving off a positive feeling!

Qin Dong couldn’t help but be immersed in it. After a long while, he nodded. Her heart skipped a beat. It seemed that this painting was real!

Qin Dong pursed her lips and walked up to Qiao Nian’s stone wall painting. When she saw what was on it, she was stunned.

Her hands trembled as she touched the painting. The feeling of this painting was identical to the one Song Yu had brought. Even the threads in the corner were made of gold. It was simply beautiful! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Qin Dong stared at every detail carefully. This painting perfectly explained what Mr. Huang Shi wanted to say. She was instantly flustered.

Zhang Lei, who was standing at the side, asked politely, “Madam Li, do you have the results of the appraisal?”

Only then did Qin Dong come back to her senses. She glanced at the expectant guests and shook her head gently, saying blankly, “These two paintings are both real!”

When Qin Dong said this, everyone was stunned.

“How is this possible?”

“This must be impossible. There can’t be two identical paintings in the world!”

“How strange. Madam Li is a famous antique collector. Even Madam Li couldn’t identify it. Looks like Miss Qiao’s forgery really took a lot of effort!”

“I still don’t think such a situation is possible!”

…

Song Yu stood there calmly, but a trace of coldness gradually appeared in the confident smile on her face.

She really hadn’t expected the fake Qiao Nian had found to be so authentic. Song Yu pursed her lips.
