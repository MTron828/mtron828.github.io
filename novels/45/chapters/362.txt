Chapter 363: Recommendation

Just now, when Lu Nian spoke up for Qiao Nian, Song Yu was already in disbelief. Now, Brother Gu Zhou had spoken up as well.

Although Brother Gu Zhou’s words were very fair, with so many people questioning Qiao Nian, Brother Gu Zhou was clearly helping Qiao Nian.

Who exactly was Qiao Nian?

Why were Second Brother and Brother Gu Zhou speaking up for Qiao Nian?

Song Yu’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. She had never heard of Qiao Nian or seen her before. Qiao Nian seemed to have appeared out of thin air.

No one knew Lu Nian, so no one cared about his words. However, everyone knew Gu Zhou. When Gu Zhou spoke, everyone fell silent.

Even though Gu Zhou was just an invalid, he was still the only heir of the Gu family.

The Gu family was extremely powerful. Gu Zhou could easily make a family disappear from An City.

Everyone present had good judgment. Gu Zhou was clearly protecting Qiao Nian. Of course, they didn’t want to get into trouble.

Hence, one by one, they took advantage of the situation.

“You’re right. We should compare the paintings.”

“I wonder if there are any painters or appraisers present?”

“Painters and appraisers, please recommend yourself!”

......

…

Of course, Song Yu wasn’t afraid of her painting being appraised. A calm smile appeared on her face as she said openly, “Are there any experts present? Please stand up and answer for everyone. Whose painting is fake?”

Seeing how open-minded Song Yu was, everyone admired her greatly.

“Miss Song is indeed a heroine!”

“Miss Song, we believe you!”

“But at this point, where should we go to find an appraisal expert?”

Qin Lu looked around, his gaze finally landing on Zhang Lei’s face. “Mr. Zhang, can you help us appraise it?”

Zhang Lei smiled and explained, “Miss Qin, you’re flattering me. I’m just a host. I don’t know how to appraise antiques!”

At this moment, Qin Dong stepped forward. “Perhaps I can help take a look.”

Qin Dong also wanted to know which painting was real. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Moreover, it was her honor to be able to see Mr. Huang Shi’s painting in her lifetime.

Moreover, the other party was a girl her son had taken a liking to. She trusted her son’s taste.

She had been carefully observing Miss Qiao just now. From the moment Miss Qiao pointed out that there was something wrong with Song Yu’s painting, Miss Qiao’s expression had not changed in the slightest. That calm confidence seemed to be emanating from her bones.

Moreover, Qin Dong also trusted her first instinct. She felt that Miss Qiao wouldn’t lie.

Hence, she was willing to take the risk.

“Madam Li is an antique dealer. She has seen many antiques. She will definitely be able to tell which piece is real.”

“I believe Madam Li will definitely give the results of the appraisal impartially.”

“Madam Li, we’re counting on you now.”

…

Everyone had placed all their hopes on Qin Dong.

Song Yu’s lips curved up slightly. She stepped forward and extended her hand to Qin Dong, a polite smile on her face. “Madam Li, thank you for your trouble!”

A gentle smile appeared on Qin Dong’s face. She shook Song Yu’s hand and said, “Miss Song, you’re too polite. However, I’m a little worried that I’ll live up to your expectations.”

When Qiao Nian heard Qin Dong’s words, she stepped forward with a smile and said, “It’s already admirable that Madam Li can step forward at a time like this. No matter what the results are, I’ll respect them!”

When Qin Dong heard Qiao Nian’s words, she instantly had a good impression of her. How could she not understand what Qiao Nian meant?

Qiao Nian spoke very politely, but she was giving her a way out.

Even if there was no result from this appraisal, no one would criticize her.

This daughter-in-law was really obedient and sensible. She was determined to have her!
