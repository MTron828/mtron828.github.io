1431 Childbirth?

Gu Zhou made a video call to Xiao Shi. The call went through very quickly, and Xiao Shi’s beautiful little face appeared on the phone screen.

At the Lu family villa.

“Daddy!” Holding the cell phone with both hands, Xiao Shi looked at Gu Zhou’s face on the phone and called out excitedly. Just as she was about to speak, she saw Qiao Nian appear on the screen as well. Her eyes lit up. “Mommy!”

Xiao Shi heard footsteps in the distance. Without waiting for Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian to speak, she hurriedly waved at that person and called out happily, “Brother and Second Brother, Daddy and Mommy are on a video call!”

In less than five seconds, the three little ones had already sat obediently in front of their phones, staring unblinkingly at Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian through their phones.

Gu Qi and Xiao Bao said in unison, “Dad and Mommy.”

After Gu Zhou greeted the three little ones, he pushed his phone closer to Qiao Nian.

“Did you have a good time at Grandma’s house?” Qiao Nian asked with a smile.

“Mommy, Xiao Shi is so happy. Uncle even brought us to the amusement park today, and Xiao Shi even sat on the Ferris wheel like a princess!” When Xiao Shi said this, her face was filled with a happy smile.

Xiao Bao, who was sitting beside Xiao Shi, said impatiently, “Mommy, we even sat on a roller coaster. The roller coaster is so fast, but Xiao Bao is so brave. He’s not afraid at all!”

Gu Qi, who was sitting on the other side of Xiao Shi, only nodded and did not speak.

Xiao Shi leaned forward slightly and smiled at Qiao Nian on the phone screen. She said excitedly, “Mommy, Xiao Shi even ate ice cream today. The ice cream is really delicious. When are you and Daddy coming back? Xiao Shi has already begun to miss you!”

After Xiao Shi finished speaking, Gu Qi and Xiao Bao immediately turned serious, as if they were waiting for her answer.

Qiao Nian looked at the three children in a daze. She had never expected that she would be so happy after getting married casually.

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but smile. Not only did she have a husband who loved her very much, but she had also found her family and three adorable children. She had already reached the peak of her life!

Seeing that Qiao Qiao Nian didn’t answer, Xiao Bao tilted his head and asked seriously, “Mommy, when are you and Dad coming back?”

Qiao Nian’s thoughts were called back to her by Xiao Bao. With a smile on her face, she said softly, “It might be a while before we can go home. Can you stay at Grandma’s house for the time being?”

When the three children heard Qiao Nian’s words, their eyes were filled with disappointment. They really wanted to be with their parents.

Even through the screen, Qiao Nian could feel the disappointment of the three children. She wanted to go home now, but the kidnapping case from more than twenty years ago had yet to be investigated. Those who wanted the lives of the Gu and Lu families had yet to be investigated. If she went home now because of her children, it might not be long before they were killed. In order for them to be happy, she had to get rid of their enemies.

A trace of guilt flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes, but she quickly smiled gently and said, “You have to listen to the adults at home and remember to study hard.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Xiao Bao looked at Qiao Nian’s face. In a daze, he seemed to have returned to MY. At that time, he waited at home every day for his Daddy to come home, but his Daddy was very busy. He could only take some time off to go home every time.

At the thought of this, Xiao Bao said obediently, “Daddy and Mommy, you don’t have to worry about us. We’ll take good care of ourselves. We’ll be good too!”

Gu Qi sat at the side and nodded. “I’ll take good care of my younger siblings!”

When Xiao Shi smiled, her eyes curved into crescents. She said sweetly, “Xiao Shi will be obedient too. Grandma and Grandma both say that Xiao Shi is the most obedient!”

Gu Zhou looked at the three obedient children and nodded in satisfaction.

When Qiao Nian heard their words, her eyes were filled with smiles. Her children were really too obedient and adorable. She wanted to go home and be with them now.

However, in the next moment, Qiao Nian heard Xiao Bao ask innocently, “Daddy and Mommy, are you going to bring more younger siblings back for us?”

The smile on Qiao Nian’s face froze.
