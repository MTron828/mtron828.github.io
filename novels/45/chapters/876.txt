877 Mommy, It Hurts!

Song Man’s gaze landed on Xiao Shi’s face, and a glint flashed across her eyes. Without hesitation, she picked Xiao Shi up and brought her to the window of the ward.

Song Man only had one hand. Her hugging Xiao Shi was very awkward.

Xiao Shi’s arm hurt for a moment. She called out softly, “Mommy, it hurts!”

When she reached the window, Song Man placed Xiao Shi on it and sat with one hand around her neck.

When Qiao Nian saw Song Man’s actions, her expression changed slightly. She asked, “Song Man, do you know what you’re doing? This is against the law!”

Gu Zhou also realized what Song Man was going to do. A trace of panic appeared on his originally expressionless face, and he became nervous. “Xiao Shi!”

Song Man did not speak. She turned to look downstairs and knew what to do.

Since everyone had already fallen out, there was no need for her to pretend anymore.

Song Man looked at Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian expressionlessly. She sat on the edge of the window.

As long as she leaned back with Xiao Shi, she and Xiao Shi would fall. They were at the twenty-first floor. She and Xiao Shi would definitely fall to their deaths. There was no chance of survival.

Chen Qing’s expression suddenly changed. He had received training in this field before. At this moment, he had to calm Song Man down. He walked forward and hurriedly said, “Miss Song, let’s discuss it properly!”

Gu Zhou hurriedly said, “You can ask for anything. Let Xiao Shi go first. I promise I won’t pursue the matter with you!”

Qiao Nian was also shocked by Song Man’s actions. She hadn’t expected Song Man to do such a dangerous thing.

She did not understand why Song Man did not choose to take the opportunity to confess at this moment. If she confessed, not only would Song Man benefit, but she would also be able to escape unscathed.

Why did Song Man have to choose such an extreme method?

Qiao Nian felt that Song Man was a little strange.

At this moment, Xiao Shi was also shocked. Her face was pale. She was an intelligent child to begin with, and she instantly understood everything that had happened.

Xiao Shi looked at Song Man sadly and asked, “Mommy, am I really not your child? Then…”

When Song Man heard Xiao Shi’s voice, her eyes turned red. She felt terrible. “I’m sorry, Xiao Shi.”

When Qiao Nian heard Song Man’s words, she knew that Song Man still cared a lot about Xiao Shi. She hurriedly said, “Song Man, you raised her yourself. She has always stood by your side and taken care of you. Do you really have the heart to die with her?”

Song Man smiled coldly and asked, “Why wouldn’t I have the heart? I raised her in order to marry into the Gu family and live a carefree life in the future. She’s just a tool for me. Who cares about a tool?”

Song Man’s eyes grew redder and redder. She said in despair, “Everything I’ve done is for today, but I didn’t expect Qiao Nian to discover something wrong with me so quickly. Let me tell you, I’d rather die than be dishonored. I’ll never let you get what you want!”

Towards the end, Song Man looked at Gu Zhou and gritted her teeth. “If you want to know who the mother of the child is, stop dreaming. You’ll never find her!”

At this moment, Xiao Shi’s face was already covered in tears. She had always liked her mommy. Her mommy was her entire world.

But now, everyone was telling her that her mommy was fake, and that her mommy was just using her. Why had things become like this? Her mommy clearly loved her very much.

Xiao Shi closed her eyes in pain, letting her tears fall.

With that, Song Man hugged Xiao Shi and fell out of the window.

The other three people in the room were all stunned by Song Man’s actions. They quickly ran towards the window.

“Mommy!” Xiao Shi opened her eyes and hugged Song Man’s arm tightly. Although she knew that Song Man was not her mommy, she really liked her. Song Man was everything to her. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

A trace of shock flashed in Song Man’s eyes. She did not expect Xiao Shi to be willing to call her Mommy even though she knew the truth.

Her soft voice was like a warm current that warmed her entire body.

The tears in Song Man’s eyes blurred her vision. She wanted to see Xiao Shi’s face clearly, but she couldn’t. She said guiltily, “Xiao Shi, thank you for being by my side!”
