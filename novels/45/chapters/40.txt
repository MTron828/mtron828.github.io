“Miss Shen, isn’t lying on the ground rather cold?” Qiao Nian asked as she walked up to Shen Xing. Reaching out, she pinched Shen Xing’s philtrum.

Shen Xing came to in a daze. The moment she opened her eyes, she glimpsed Qiao Nian. It was as if she had seen a ghost. She turned pale in fright and pushed Qiao Nian away.

Qiao Nian fell back uncontrollably and shut her eyes tight. However, the expected pain from the impact did not arrive.

Opening her eyes, she found that Gu Zhou was holding onto her waist, preventing her from falling.

Shen Xing scrambled to her feet and ran to Matriarch Shen’s side. With teary eyes, she said, “Grandma, you have to believe me. It really was Qiao Nian who killed my sister!”

“Haven’t you embarrassed yourself enough?” Matriarch Shen gripped her walking stick tightly. Glaring at Shen Xing, she roared, “Hurry up and apologize to Miss Qiao!”

Shen Xing looked at Matriarch Shen in disbelief. She had thought that Grandma was on her side. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Matriarch Shen gave Shen Ming a look.

Shen Ming walked up to Shen Xing and said in a voice so low that only the two of them could hear, “Apologize quickly!”

Shen Xing’s tears fell even faster. She bit her lip, stubbornly refusing to apologize.

Gu Zhou stood beside Qiao Nian like a protective shield. He said coldly, “Miss Shen, are you really unwilling to apologize?”

Gu Zhou’s words shocked everyone present.

In the rumors, the Second Young Master of the Gu family had always been cold and aloof, and rarely interacted much with other people. But now, he was protecting Qiao Nian.

When Shen Xing heard Gu Zhou’s words, she trembled in fear. Her gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face, and her eyes filled with hatred.

Shen Ming turned to glance at Shen Xing. Deep down, he couldn’t bear to see his beloved daughter in such a state. Putting on a smile, he said, “Second Young Master Gu, Xing Xing is still a young child. Why don’t we let this matter rest…”

“Child?” Gu Zhou raised his eyebrows and said mockingly, “If I remember correctly, she’s already come of age.”

At Gu Zhou’s words, Shen Ming’s expression froze.

Matriarch Shen glared daggers at Shen Ming, signaling for him to stop talking.

Silently, Shen Ming shut his mouth. He was afraid that if he spoke again, he would lose all his face today.

Gu Zhou’s narrow eyes swept across the crowd. His voice wasn’t loud, but it was filled with strength. “Qiao Nian is my date. She came with me to congratulate Madam Shen on her birthday. I won’t let her suffer.”

Hearing this, Su Yan and Qiao Xin turned pale.

At this moment, Shen Ming and Shen Xing didn’t look any better either.

Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou. She really hadn’t expected Gu Zhou to speak up for her.

Su Yan, who was standing not far away, saw Qiao Nian gazing at Gu Zhou. He felt a little disappointed. He hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to be Gu Zhou’s date.

Qiao Xin lowered her head slightly, the corners of her lips curving up. She had thought that Gu Zhou really liked Qiao Nian, but it seemed that their relationship as a married couple wasn’t that great either. Did that mean that she still had a chance?

Qiao Xin’s eyes darted to the side. She pulled Su Yan away from the scene, looking up at him worriedly.

“What’s wrong?” Su Yan looked at Qiao Xin with concern.

Qiao Xin pursed her lips, her eyes brimming with worry. “Brother Su Yan, there’s something I’m not sure I should tell you.”

Su Yan glanced at Qiao Xin’s conflicted expression and his heart softened. “What is it?”

“My sister heard from me previously that you would be attending Matriarch Shen’s birthday banquet as well. She wanted to come too, but our parents didn’t allow her to.” Qiao Xin glanced at Su Yan awkwardly. “I don’t know how she got here either.”

Seeing that Su Yan remained silent, Qiao Xin thought that he didn’t understand her. She continued her explanation. “It seems like Sister came here with Second Young Master Gu.. If Second Young Master Gu finds out that he was just being used to get to the party, I’m scared that the Qiao family will suffer!”
