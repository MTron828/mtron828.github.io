1138 Very Happy

“Thank you.” Qiao Nian’s voice was a little choked up, and her eyes turned slightly red. Tears welled up in her eyes.

Gu Qi hugged Qiao Nian tightly and said slowly, “Mommy, you don’t have to thank me.”

Qiao Nian looked up and blinked, trying hard to force back her tears. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

After a long while, Qiao Nian let go of Gu Qi.

Gu Qi smiled at Qiao Nian and waved his hand. “I hope Mommy can meet Grandpa and Grandma successfully!”

Xiao Shi waved her hand vigorously, a happy smile on her face. “Mommy, good luck!”

Qiao Nian looked down at Gu Qi and Xiao Shi. Her lips curved up involuntarily as she nodded vigorously. “Okay!”

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian walked out of the Gu family villa. As soon as they got into the car, Qiao Nian took out a tissue and wiped the tears from her eyes.

Gu Zhou sat down beside Qiao Nian and reached out to hold her hand. He asked softly, “What’s wrong?”

“I’m just thinking about the past again.” Qiao Nian told Gu Zhou about her agreement with Gu Qi to find family. She couldn’t help but sigh. “Actually, I think I’m quite happy. Although I wasn’t happy in the past and suffered a lot, now that I’ve found my children and am about to see my family, I seem to be happier than others!”

Gu Zhou kept looking at Qiao Nian gently. He held Qiao Nian’s hand tightly, as if comforting her.

Actually, he felt that he was very lucky, especially after meeting Qiao Nian. His condition had stabilized, and his long-cherished wish had been fulfilled.

More than half an hour later.

Qiao Nian looked at the long line of cars in front of her and frowned imperceptibly. “There are so many cars after work!”

Gu Zhou glanced at the watch on his wrist. He and Qiao Nian had been stuck here for ten minutes.

If he had known that there would be a traffic jam here, he would have driven straight to the highway. Although it might take a ten-minute detour, he wouldn’t have encountered a traffic jam!

At this moment, Qiao Nian’s phone rang.

She took it out and saw that it was her brother calling her!

“Brother.” After Qiao Nian picked up the call, she placed the phone to her ear and called out.

“Where are you now?”

“We’re in the middle of a traffic jam.” As Qiao Nian spoke, she frowned slightly, her heart clenching. “It’s rush hour now. There are many people on the road!”

Qiao Nian’s palms were already sweating from nervousness. Although she was complaining about the traffic jam, she still heaved a sigh of relief. She hadn’t thought of a way to face her mother yet.

“Shall I pick you up on my motorcycle?”

“There’s no need, there’s no need. If you come, you might be blocked halfway. I’ll wait slowly!”

Qiao Nian always went out when others were working, so she never thought about traffic jams.

Gu Zhou did not expect a traffic jam.

“You don’t know how long the traffic jam will last. Let me get someone to pick you up on a motorcycle!” Lu Zhu said worriedly.

Qiao Nian lowered her head and navigated the map electronically. She said, “The GPS says that we can leave in about ten minutes. Brother, wait for me at home!”

Lu Zhu thought for a while and didn’t insist on sending someone to pick Qiao Nian up.

After Qiao Nian hung up, she gripped her cell phone tightly. Her lips were pursed tightly as she stared straight ahead!

“You don’t have to worry. Auntie Lu is a very gentle person!” Seeing that Qiao Nian’s heart had been tense, Gu Zhou comforted her.

Hearing Gu Zhou’s words, Qiao Nian thought of her brothers and Lu Qi’s faces. Her brothers and sister were all very gentle people, so her mother should be very gentle.

This time, Qiao Nian wasn’t as nervous as before. Smiling, she said, “I’m no longer nervous.”

As soon as she finished speaking, her cell phone rang again!

“Who called this time?” Gu Zhou asked casually.

“It’s Second Brother.” Qiao Nian smiled at the caller ID on her phone and said to Gu Zhou, “I’ll take the call.”

Gu Zhou nodded.

Qiao Nian picked up the call and placed the phone to her ear. “Second Brother?”

“Sister Nian, are you almost home?” Lu Nian’s gentle voice rang out from the cell phone.

Qiao Nian smiled and said, “I might be a little late getting home. Don’t worry.”

“Alright, then I’ll change my clothes and pick you up at the door,” Lu Nian said into his Bluetooth earpiece. His gaze fell on the closet. His mother and sister were going to acknowledge each other. On such an important day, he had to wear something good-looking.
