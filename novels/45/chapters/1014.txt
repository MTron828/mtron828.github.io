1015 Zhou Zhou?

The bathroom was filled with mist. He sat in the bathtub and saw Qiao Nian sitting beside it, coaxing him gently.

He and Qiao Nian seemed to be talking, but he couldn’t hear her clearly. He vaguely heard Qiao Nian call him Zhou Zhou.

Zhou Zhou!

Gu Zhou frowned slightly.

When he was very young, only his grandmother and mother would call him that. Grandma always called him Ah Zhou.

Strange.

Why did Qiao Nian call him Zhou Zhou?

Just as Gu Zhou was feeling puzzled, he saw him bring Qiao Nian into the bathtub. The water soaked Qiao Nian’s clothes. In the next moment, he kissed Qiao Nian’s lips.

Gu Zhou suddenly came back to his senses. Looking at the touching scene of the sisters reuniting in front of him, his gaze gradually softened.

He thought about the scene just now. If it weren’t for Gu Chuan’s existence, he might have thought that he was hallucinating. Could it be that there was still a portion of his memories that he couldn’t remember?

He wondered when that had happened. Why couldn’t he remember anything?

Just as Gu Zhou was feeling puzzled, Lu Zhu’s voice interrupted his thoughts.

“Sugar, welcome home!”

When Matriarch Lu heard Lu Zhu’s words, her pupils instantly dilated. She stood rooted to the ground in shock, feeling as if she was hallucinating.

Logically speaking, even if she did not step forward to stop him, Lu Rao and Lu Jiang should have stopped Lu Zhu from randomly acknowledging his relative.

Could it be?

Was Qiao Nian really the eldest daughter of the Lu family, Sugar?

This?

How was this possible?

No, no, no.

Her grandchildren must have mistaken her for someone else!

At that time, she had seen Sugar’s broken arm with her own eyes. Moreover, her daughter-in-law had done many DNA tests, proving that the broken arm belonged to Sugar.

Sugar had clearly been…

Matriarch Lu’s mind was in a mess.

Song Yu looked at Lu Zhu with a deep gaze, then at the other two brothers of the Lu family, and finally at Lu Qi, who was in Qiao Nian’s arms.

They actually all knew that Qiao Nian was the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

She had been in the Lu family for so many years and had grown up with them. Although she was not biologically related to the Lu family, why were they hiding something from her?

Or had the few of them never treated her as a member of the Lu family?

Even if they had found Qiao Nian, they had never thought of telling her about this.

Song Yu had mixed feelings.

When Song Xue found her, her heart was in a mess. She didn’t know what to do. She didn’t know what evil intentions the Song family had for letting her into the Lu family.

Although she was very afraid and didn’t want to hurt her family, they didn’t seem to treat her as family at all.

Song Yu felt a little despair. She lowered her head and stood at the side.

Matriarch Lu’s eyes were filled with disbelief. Then, she got excited and asked, “Ah Zhu, is what you said true? Is she really Sugar?”

“Grandma, she’s indeed Sugar.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

At this moment, a man in white casual clothes walked out of the room. His eyes were filled with smiles as he looked at Qiao Nian gently. He was wearing an apron, as if he had just been cooking.

This person was none other than Lu Nian.

Everyone looked at Lu Nian.

When Song Yu heard Lu Nian’s voice, her eyes lit up. She tried hard to suppress the joy in her eyes. “Second Brother.”

However, Lu Nian’s gaze never lingered on Song Yu. He walked straight to Matriarch Lu and said seriously, “Grandma, Qiao Nian is really our sister. She’s the eldest daughter of the Lu family, Lu Nian, and your biological granddaughter!”

Lu Qi crawled out of Qiao Nian’s arms and wiped her tears. She hurriedly nodded and echoed, “Grandma, we won’t be mistaken. We’ve already seen the paternity test report!”

After Lu Qi finished speaking, the other members of the Lu family nodded.

Matriarch Lu glanced at her grandchildren and saw the seriousness in their eyes.

Oh my god!

Her Sugar was still alive?

Matriarch Lu’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. She was so excited that tears welled up in her eyes. She looked at Qiao Nian’s small face carefully.

She had seen Qiao Nian before and felt that she looked a little familiar. At that time, she didn’t think too much about it. She just thought that there were many people in the world who looked alike.
