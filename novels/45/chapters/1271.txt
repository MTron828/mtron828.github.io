1272 Who Is He?

Seeing that Gu Zhou was silent, Qiao Nian pointed at the child’s face. “Look at his eyebrows, nose, and mouth. His eyes are very similar to mine, so I have a feeling that this child must be ours.”

With that, Qiao Nian looked at the child in the video. Her eyes were red, and tears fell uncontrollably. She covered her mouth emotionally, trying hard not to cry.

Gu Zhou reached out and pulled Qiao Nian into his arms. He took a tissue from the side and carefully wiped Qiao Nian’s tears.

Without any evidence, Gu Zhou didn’t dare to make any decisions. However, he knew that Qiao Nian already treated that child as her own.

Gu Zhou patted Qiao Nian’s shoulder gently and cautioned her helplessly. “Don’t be emotional now. We can’t be sure whose child this is. If he’s Big Brother’s child, it doesn’t mean anything. If he’s really our child, it means that this child is very happy. He didn’t suffer for so many years like Xiao Shi.”

Gu Zhou looked at the child in the surveillance cameras and had a feeling that this child was very likely to be his.

At the thought that this child had not suffered much, Gu Zhou heaved a sigh of relief.

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she nodded in agreement. She looked at Gu Zhou with red-rimmed eyes. “You’re right. If he’s really our child, and he was raised by Big Brother, he should be doing very well.”

Gu Zhou nodded.

If it was really his child, why had Big Brother kept him by his side? Why hadn’t he sent the child to him?

Gu Zhou’s frown deepened. At this moment, his phone rang.

Only then did Qiao Nian notice that they had already finished one round. Fortunately, Gu Qi and Xiao Shi had turned the tide in that round and finally won.

On the team page, Xiao Bao sent another message.

“Junior Sister, do you want to play another round?”

Qiao Nian subconsciously looked at the child in the video. The child was looking at his cell phone expectantly.

Qiao Nian’s eyes turned red again. She firmly believed that that child was definitely the third child she had been looking for.

She looked down at the team page on her phone and opened the chat box. Her hands were trembling.

“Xiao Bao?”

Qiao Nian saw that baby Xiao Bao had turned on the loudspeaker. This meant that Xiao Bao could hear her.

Without waiting for the other party to type, she opened the voice chat. Her voice trembled slightly. “Xiao Bao?”

Chang Feng frowned. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

In the next moment, Qiao Nian saw Chang Feng looking at the camera.

Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat. She realized that Chang Feng might have noticed that she had hacked into the villa’s security system.

Qiao Nian hurriedly said, “I miss you very much.”

Chang Feng stared at the camera in silence. He took the cell phone from Xiao Bao, turned off the sound system of the phone game, and took away his phone. In the next moment, Qiao Nian realized that the screen was blank.

Eldest Senior Brother had already kicked her out of the villa’s security system again.

Previously, Qiao Nian had only suspected that the child was hers. Now, she was 100% sure. Otherwise, Eldest Senior Brother wouldn’t be in such a hurry to kick her out.

Qiao Nian knew that the other party couldn’t hear her voice message. She began to type. “Are you my baby?”

Xiao Bao took the cell phone from Chang Feng and looked at the message from Mommy. He was so excited that his eyes were filled with stars. He looked at Chang Feng seriously and asked, “Uncle Feng, I can acknowledge Mommy now, right?”

Without waiting for Chang Feng to speak, Xiao Bao continued, “This is a game. Many people are playing the game. No one will notice us, let alone realize that I’ve acknowledged Mommy, right?”

Chang Feng looked at Xiao Bao with a complicated expression and did not speak.

Seeing that Chang Feng was silent, Xiao Bao lowered his head and typed the word “Mommy”. However, before he could send the word, his phone had already turned off automatically.

“What’s going on?” Xiao Bao anxiously turned on his phone again, but there was no reaction.
