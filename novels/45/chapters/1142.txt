“Yes, I was adopted by the Qiao family when I was three years old.” Qiao Nian had a faint smile on her face as she looked at Su Yan gently. “I only found my family recently.”

Adopted at the age of three?

When Su Yan heard the word “three years old”, she suddenly thought of her eldest daughter. Her eyes stung. She quickly looked away and blinked hard, trying to maintain her calm. She took a deep breath and said, “Good, that’s good. It’s a blessing to be able to find your family!”

“Yes.” Qiao Nian smiled and nodded.

“Poor child. Did you suffer in the Qiao family?” Su Yan had the illusion that her eldest daughter was still alive. She still had a chance to see her eldest daughter and listen to every detail of her eldest daughter’s life.

“When I was three to six years old, Grandma Qiao treated me very well. After Grandma Qiao left, I was sent to the countryside.” Qiao Nian gave a brief explanation. Seeing that Su Yan’s eyes were already filled with tears, she gave a gentle smile. “I lived with Grandpa next door in the countryside and was very happy.”

Su Yan turned her head to the side. She took a few deep breaths and tried hard to suppress the sadness in her heart. When she looked at Qiao Nian again, she smiled and comforted her. “Fortunately, you’ve found your home now. You don’t have to be afraid of being wronged anymore.”

“Yes.” Qiao Nian nodded.

“Is the Lu family you’re talking about the Lu family in the Beijiang District?” Su Yan remembered that there seemed to be many children in the Lu family in the Beijiang District, but she didn’t know if their family had lost any children.

Qiao Nian shook her head gently.

“Could it be the Lu family of the Dongshan District?” Su Yan asked again. One had to know that there were only a few famous Lu families in An City.

Qiao Nian smiled and shook her head again.

Su Yan sized Qiao Nian up carefully. Qiao Nian didn’t look like she had been raised poorly. It seemed that her grandfather in the countryside treated her very well.

Qiao Nian’s hands were fair and delicate, like those of someone who had been pampered.

The Lu family, which could marry into the Gu family, was definitely a rich and powerful family.

Su Yan occasionally returned to An City. The people she knew in An City were all rich people from the old generation. As for the new families, she really didn’t know any.

When Lu Qi heard Su Yan’s question, she grew anxious. Silently, she moved to Lu Zhu’s side and tugged at his sleeve.

Lu Zhu only glanced at Lu Qi indifferently before retracting his gaze.

Lu Qi looked at Lu Zhu in surprise. Could it be that Big Brother had long thought of when to introduce his sister to Mommy? Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Actually, Lu Qi didn’t dare to step forward and reveal Qiao Nian’s identity. She was afraid!

If her mommy blamed her for hiding the truth, her legs would definitely suffer!

Su Yan lowered her head and touched Qiao Nian’s hand. Smiling, she said, “Nian Nian, where do you live? Auntie has always been overseas and doesn’t know the situation in An City. You and Gu Zhou are already married. According to etiquette, I should visit your parents. I…”

Su Yan’s gaze inadvertently fell on the red mole under Qiao Nian’s left pinky. She instantly stopped, and her pupils dilated uncontrollably.

Pursing her lips, she pictured her eldest daughter. There was a red mole under the pinky of her left thumb, and a birthmark behind her left ear.

“The Lu family of An City’s Xing Hua District.” Qiao Nian’s gaze was fixed on Su Yan’s face as she enunciated each word clearly.

When Su Yan heard Qiao Nian’s words, she was stunned. She looked up at Qiao Nian and met her smiling eyes.

If she remembered correctly, they were the only Lu family in the Xing Hua District.

Su Yan’s lips trembled a little. She pretended to be calm and asked, “What’s the house number?”

“666.”

Su Yan’s heart began to race. Wasn’t the address Qiao Nian mentioned their house?

Qiao Nian was really her eldest daughter!

Su Yan held Qiao Nian’s hand tightly and subconsciously hugged her. Her gaze fell on the small heart-shaped birthmark behind Qiao Nian’s ear. She felt a lump in her throat and said in a choked voice, “Nian Nian!”

It was her Nian Nian!

Su Yan’s heart was beating violently. She hugged Qiao Nian tightly, her body trembling involuntarily. “Nian Nian!”

“Mom,” Qiao Nian called out softly..
