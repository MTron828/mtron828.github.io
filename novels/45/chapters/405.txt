Chapter 406: Meeting Enemies on a Narrow Road

“Okay.” Lu Zhu agreed without hesitation.

Song Yue was stunned.

Song Yue’s face turned pale.

Seeing Song Yue like this, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but laugh. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Lu Zhu was really a straight man. Could it be that he really couldn’t tell what the girl meant?

Song Yue stood rooted to the ground in anger, looking resentfully at Lu Zhu and Qiao Nian’s retreating figures.

She was the daughter of the Song family. How could she leave so dejectedly?

She definitely couldn’t leave just like that!

If this matter were to spread, she would be humiliated!

Since Lu Zhu wanted the Moon Goddess, this matter would be easy to settle.

As long as she could get the Moon Goddess, Lu Zhu would definitely think highly of her and apologize to her.

At the thought of this, Song Yue became proud again.

Standing beside Song Yue, Lin Nan reminded her carefully, “Miss Song, your plane is about to take off. Please check in.”

Song Yue was already in a bad mood. She glared at Lin Nan and said angrily, “Get lost! Stand aside. I’m not boarding!”

Lin Nan’s expression darkened slightly when he heard Song Yue’s words. He put down Song Yue’s luggage and walked towards Lu Zhu without saying anything.

Song Yue was about to explode with anger when she saw Lin Nan throw down her luggage.

Lu Zhu was the Eldest Young Master of the Lu family. It was fine if he treated her like this.

Lin Nan was just a small bodyguard, yet he dared to be so arrogant. He simply did not take the Song family seriously.

Song Yue looked at Lin Nan with a dark expression. Then, she looked at the luggage with an aggrieved expression and reluctantly went to pull it up.

At this moment, a low and hoarse male voice sounded from the side. “Let me help you!”

.

When Song Yue heard this voice, she was slightly stunned. She looked up, and when she saw the man standing in front of her, her eyes widened involuntarily.

Jesus!

There was actually such a handsome man in the world!

This man was also so gentlemanly.

Song Yue’s heart skipped a beat.

This man looked familiar.

Only then did Song Yue remember that this man seemed to be the legendary King of Gambling, Jiang Cheng.

Just as Song Yue was in shock, Jiang Cheng had already handed her luggage to his bodyguard.

Song Yue stared fixedly at Jiang Cheng. She felt that her heart had fallen.

Song Yue looked at Jiang Cheng with a trace of curiosity in her heart. Was he also here to participate in this stone gambling event?

However, Jiang Cheng did not notice Song Yue’s abnormality. His gaze was fixed on Lu Zhu’s back not far away, and his thin lips curled up slightly.

Lu Zhu!

It had been a long time since they last met. He missed him so much.

MY hotel!

Qiao Nian followed Lu Zhu out of the car.

The two of them walked into the hotel. Suddenly, Qiao Nian heard a familiar and annoying voice.

“Brother, look! Sister is there!”

This voice was too familiar to Qiao Nian. When she turned around, she saw Qiao Xin holding Qiao Yu’s hand as they got out of the car.

Qiao Xin was wearing a long white dress and a straw hat. She had a gentle smile on her face, as if she was here for a vacation.

A trace of impatience flashed across Qiao Nian’s eyes. Enemies were really bound to meet on a narrow road. Even if they were overseas, they could still meet.

At this moment, Qiao Yu also saw Qiao Nian. His gaze paused on her face for a moment before he walked over with Qiao Xin.

Qiao Yu didn’t speak to Qiao Nian. Instead, he looked at Lu Zhu, who was standing beside her, and asked seriously, “Director Lu, the South Mountain project has been completed. When do you think we should hand over the house?”

“Next month!” Lu Zhu said simply.

Qiao Yu nodded slightly. Finally, his gaze landed on Qiao Nian, who was beside Lu Zhu. A trace of joy flashed across his eyes.
