Chapter 208: Happy Birthday!

Song Yu watched as Qiao Nian got into Matriarch Gu’s car. After the Gu family’s car left, a trace of confusion flashed in Song Yu’s eyes.

Who was this girl?

Just now, Matriarch Gu seemed to be very close to her.

She remembered that Zhao Qian and Jiang Yue didn’t look like this.

What embarrassed Song Yu the most was that she had even mistaken a young lady for her mother. How embarrassing!

The car gradually left the Lu family villa.

Qiao Nian recalled that Song Yu had just mistaken her for someone else. She asked curiously, “Grandma, what’s Song Yu’s relationship with the Lu family?”

Matriarch Gu had expected this question, and had prepared a response. With Song Yu’s reaction in mind, she explained, “Back then, when the eldest daughter of the Lu family died an unnatural death, the Lu family was extremely upset. It was at this time that they met Song Yu, who had been abandoned on the streets. Hence, Song Yu was brought back to the Lu family and took Mrs. Lu’s surname. They took her as their adopted daughter.” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Qiao Nian nodded in understanding. From the reaction of the Lu family members just now, the departure of the eldest daughter of the Lu family had been a huge blow to them. Even now, the Lu family had yet to recover from the early demise of their eldest daughter.

Song Yu was the adopted daughter of the Lu family. Did that mean that the “mother” Song Yu was referring to was Mrs. Lu?

Could it be that she looked very similar to Mrs. Lu, whom she had never met?

Some fragmented memories flashed through Qiao Nian’s mind, but she couldn’t seem to grasp them.

“Nian Nian.”

Matriarch Gu smiled gently and reached out to hold Qiao Nian’s hand. Her eyes were filled with love.

Qiao Nian came back to her senses and smiled at Matriarch Gu. “Grandma.”

“I heard from Chen Qing that today is your birthday!” As Matriarch Gu spoke, she took out a dark blue ticket from her pocket and handed it to Qiao Nian. “You’ve registered your marriage with Gu Zhou. Now, you’re a member of the Gu family. This is your first birthday since you arrived at the Gu residence. This is a small gift Grandma has prepared for you. Hurry up and accept it. Happy birthday, my Nian Nian.”

When Qiao Nian heard Matriarch Gu’s words, her heart warmed. Looking at the ticket in her hand, her eyes lit up like the stars in the night sky. “This is a ticket to Mr. Donghua’s concert!”

“Yes. Do you like it?” Matriarch Gu looked at Qiao Nian lovingly.

Qiao Nian gripped the ticket in her hand tightly. Mr. Donghua was a world-renowned musician. She had heard that tickets for his concerts were only sold to insiders of the music industry. Only the top musicians in the industry had a chance to get tickets.

Grandma had actually given her a ticket.

Qiao Nian’s eyes grew hot. She looked up at Matriarch Gu and said gratefully, “Thank you, Grandma. Grandma, how did you know that I liked Mr. Donghua’s music?”

Matriarch Gu gave a teasing smile. “Ah Zhou told me, of course!”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned.

Strange.

She had never told Gu Zhou that she liked Mr. Donghua’s music.

However, Qiao Nian couldn’t be bothered to think too much about it right now. She hugged Matriarch Gu gratefully and said happily, “Grandma, thank you so much. You’re so good to me!”

Matriarch Gu’s heart softened when she saw Qiao Nian’s sweet, coquettish manner. This was the first time Qiao Nian had acted like the young girl she was since she married into the Gu family!

Matriarch Gu gently patted Qiao Nian’s back. “Good girl. You’re my darling child. Isn’t it only right that I treat you well? Happy birthday!”

Qiao Nian’s eyes were a little wet. She smiled and nodded.

After returning to the Gu residence, Qiao Nian placed the ticket Matriarch Gu had given her into the cabinet of the dressing table. Her eyes sparkled with joy.

Qiao Nian glanced at the time on her phone. It had been some time since she had left a blood sample at the hospital. Thinking of how the Lu family mourned their eldest daughter, she took out her phone and dialed the hospital’s number.

“Hello, this is the nurses’ station. I’m Nurse Wang.”

Back then, Nurse Wang was the one who had collected Qiao Nian’s blood sample. Qiao Nian smiled and greeted, “Nurse Wang, hello. I’m Qiao Nian.”

“Hello, Miss Qiao.” Nurse Wang had a deep impression of Qiao Nian. After all, Qiao Nian was too good-looking.
