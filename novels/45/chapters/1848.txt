Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Time seemed to pass exceptionally slowly. Other than Old Master Qin and Shen Mei, everyone else in the room was so nervous that they did not dare to breathe.

Lina was so nervous that her palms were covered in sweat. She stared unblinkingly at Old Master Qin.

About a minute later, Old Master Qin calmly retracted his hand. “I can treat

Madam President’s cerebral palsy.”

Everyone’s eyes lit up. Lina immediately sat forward, her eyes sparkling. She asked, “Grandpa, is that true? My father has also hired many famous doctors for my mother. They can only maintain and recuperate her health. They even said that this illness can’t be cured.’

Those doctors were also famous doctors from all over the world. No one dared to guarantee anything.

Seeing Lina’s excited expression, Old Master Qin slowly extended two fingers at her and smiled.

“Second?” Lina’s eyes darted around and she asked impatiently, “Did Grandpa say two years?”

Lina was already overjoyed. She would be grateful if she could treat her mother’s cerebral palsy in two years.

However, in the next moment, Lina saw Old Master Qin shake his head.

Lina’s heart instantly tensed up. Did Grandpa Qin mean twenty years? Lina asked carefully, “Twenty months or twenty years?” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but laugh out loud. She explained gently, “Grandpa means that it will only take two days to treat Madam President’s illness.”

When Lina heard Qiao Nian’s words, a tear fell from the corner of her eye. Her and Shen Mei’s hands began to tremble violently.

Qiao Nian was about to persuade Lina not to be too agitated when her gaze inadvertently fell on Shen Mei’s trembling hands. Thinking that Shen Mei was triggered by the good news, she hurriedly said, “Madam President, you can’t be too agitated now. You have to calm down. Do you need me to help you?”

As she spoke, Qiao Nian looked at her grandfather, who was sitting on the other side of Shen Mei. She was about to ask her grandfather if she should do it or if he should.

At this moment, Lina’s sobbing voice rang out. “l was too agitated.”

Lina looked at her mother with teary eyes and raised her hand to wipe her

tears. She was extremely excited as she said, “All this time, my greatest wish has been for Mom to recover. I never expected that in just two days, Mom would really recover. I-I think I’m dreaming!’

At that time, Lina had thought that if it really was twenty years, although her mother was no longer young, she would be happy for her mother if she could see the entire world like a normal person.

The tears in her eyes fell uncontrollably. Lina’s voice was choked with emotion. “I’ve waited for this day for a long time.”

Chen Qing, who had been sitting on the other sofa, stood up and walked to Lina’s side. He put his arm around Lina’s shoulder, as if silently comforting her.

Chen Qing handed a tissue to Lina with his other hand. Lina nodded slightly and took the tissue to wipe her tears.

Qiao Nian was also relieved. She looked at Old Master Qin and saw that his grandfather was also looking at her, as if he had something to tell her.

Qiao Nian understood tacitly, so she said to Gu Zhou, “Stay with them and talk. Grandpa and I will discuss Madam President’s condition.”

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian calmly. “After a pause, he asked, ‘Do you think I like to chat?”

Qiao Nian finally understood that Gu Zhou wanted to be with her, so she said,

“Alright! ‘

Holding Gu Zhou’s hand, Qiao Nian followed behind Old Master Qin. The three of them entered the study.

Through the French windows of the study, Gu Zhou looked out at the river scenery. He thought to himself that it wouldn’t be bad to live here in the future.

With this thought in mind, Gu Zhou opened the window in the corner. The sound of the surging river could be heard from outside, covering the voices in the study.

Qiao Nian sat close to Old Master Qin on the sofa. Her beautiful eyes were slightly narrowed, as if she was waiting for him to speak.

“Her illness can be cured in two days.” Old Master Qin didn’t waste any time and went straight to the point. “However, some medicinal herbs can only be chanced upon by luck. I don’t have those medicinal herbs in my hands. You

have to find them..
