1531 Distrust

The president came out of the room and walked towards the medicine room. Seeing that Ollie was developing a medicine, he narrowed his eyes slightly and looked solemnly at the materials in Ollie’s hand.

“Mr. President.” Seeing that the president had arrived, Ollie handed the item in his hand to his assistant and walked respectfully to the president.

The president gave Ollie a look and walked out. He opened the window and looked at Ollie in front of him. After a moment of silence, he asked, “Do you know how to remove the Hypnotic worm?”

When Ollie heard the president’s question, he pursed his lips and shook his head. “I don’t know.”

The president slowly closed his eyes and took a deep breath before asking, “She used surgical medicine before. If we don’t consider it, will it affect her treatment?”

When Doctor Ollie heard the president’s words, he said without hesitation, “I wonder if those medicines have anything to do with Madam’s current condition?”

He wasn’t sure if those surgeries had caused Madam President to fall ill.

When the president heard Ollie’s words, he shook his head and said, “It shouldn’t be a problem.”

Doctor Ollie pondered for a moment before saying, “According to my treatment methods, I shouldn’t need to check the surgical medication. I just need to know which medicine Madam is allergic to.”

He paused for a moment and continued, “But Miss Qiao’s diagnosis and treatment methods are different from mine. If she hadn’t gotten someone to examine the soil, it would have been impossible for us to discover the poison of the Teng Yang Flower, let alone Madam President’s poisoning. Therefore, I’m not sure if the medicine Madam used for surgery is related to the medicine Miss Qiao is prescribing now.”

The president had been very glad that Qiao Nian didn’t need to look at all the medical records, but what Ollie said next made sense.

The doctors he had found hadn’t discovered the Hypnotic worm in Madam’s body. Yesterday, he had been skeptical, but today, he had seen with his own eyes that when Qiao Nian performed acupuncture on Madam again, a black bulge ran down her back.

At that time, he was stunned. At that time, he didn’t dare to speak because he was afraid of disturbing Qiao Nian. If Qiao Nian pricked the wrong spot, Madam would be the one to suffer.

Qiao Nian’s medical skills were very good, but if he hid the medicine used during Madam’s surgery and something happened during Qiao Nian’s treatment, wouldn’t he be harming Madam?

The president’s expression darkened completely. He said sternly, “I want an accurate explanation!”

Dr. Ollie’s heart jumped to his throat.

After all, the president was still the president. He exuded the pressure of a superior, causing ordinary people like him to be terrified.

Ollie lowered his gaze. He didn’t need to look at the patient’s past medical records to treat her illness. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

If Qiao Nian was just an ordinary doctor, he would think that Qiao Nian was a busybody. There was no need to look at the patient’s past cases.

He still remembered that when the injured Seventh Princess was carried over, the silver needles on her body stopped the poison and blood from flowing out of her body, and also reduced the pain in her body.

This time, it was Qiao Nian who realized that there was something wrong with the soil of the Falling Autumn Grass.

Qiao Nian had surprised him too many times. She might really need to understand a patient’s treatment records before she could treat her.

He had been by the president’s side for more than twenty years, so he could naturally sense that the president was unwilling to show Qiao Nian Madam’s treatment records. Otherwise, the president wouldn’t have asked him if it would affect a patient if he didn’t give her the records.

Ollie fell silent. If he affirmed the president’s thoughts and something happened to Madam, even ten heads wouldn’t be enough.

He felt the president’s cold gaze on him. He lowered his head and said honestly, “President, why don’t we give Miss Qiao a portion of Madam’s medical records first? As for the remaining cases, I’ll think of another way to add them. That way, Miss Qiao shouldn’t see any loopholes.”

Ollie was a doctor. He was familiar with medicine. He could use other illnesses to account for the medicine reasonably.

As soon as he finished speaking, he felt the displeasure in the president’s eyes.

Ollie’s heart was in his throat. He lowered his gaze, not daring to look up, let alone at the president.
