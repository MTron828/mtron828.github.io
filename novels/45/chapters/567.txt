Qiao Nian’s frown deepened. Who was speaking? She narrowed her eyes. In a daze, she seemed to see a few people in white coats standing at the side.

Was she on the operating table?

Suddenly, a sharp pain came from below.

Qiao Nian was stunned. She tried hard to regulate her breathing, but the pain in her lower body was getting worse and worse, and the strength in her body was gradually disappearing. In a daze, she could still hear what the doctor was saying.

It hurt.

So tired.

She couldn’t take it anymore.

“Wow!”

The crisp cry swept away Qiao Nian’s fatigue. She suddenly opened her eyes. A doctor was walking over with a child in his arms. “Miss Qiao, look. The child is fine.”

The child was fine?

Qiao Nian’s head hurt more and more. Cold sweat broke out on her forehead. Her child was actually fine.

She remembered that her child had died in childbirth!

At this moment, another doctor walked over and said anxiously, “Miss Qiao, persevere. There’s another child in your stomach!”

Qiao Nian forced herself to stay upright. In a daze, she saw another doctor carrying a child in front of her.

“Both children are fine…”

… .

“Auntie!”

A young voice pulled Qiao Nian back to reality. Only then did she realize that she wasn’t lying on the operating table, but in Gu Qi’s room.

“Auntie, why are you crying?” Gu Qi forced himself to sit up. He wiped the tears off Qiao Nian’s face with his young hand and said very seriously, “Auntie, don’t cry. Little Qi is fine.”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Qi and pulled him into her arms, her tears falling uncontrollably.

She had not given birth to a boy, but two children.

She vaguely remembered that when Qin Chuan found her, she was holding a dead child in her arms and crying her heart out. She had broken down mentally. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

At that time, Qin Chuan had no choice but to find a psychiatrist to erase the memory of her suffering during childbirth. Hence, all this time, she only remembered giving birth to one child.

Where was her other child?

Was that child alive or dead?

“Don’t cry, Auntie. Don’t cry!”

Gu Qi’s soft voice in her arms gradually soothed the uneasiness in Qiao Nian’s heart. She silently wiped her tears. She had to find her other child.

Qiao Nian let go of Gu Qi and wiped her tears away. There were still tears on her eyelashes. “Little Qi, thank you.”

“Auntie, you can’t thank Little Qi.” Little Qi frowned solemnly.

Qiao Nian helped Gu Qi lie down. Sniffing, she asked curiously, “Why?”

Little Qi explained clearly, word for word, “Previously, Dad told me that thank you was meant for outsiders. Auntie and I are family, and we’re close, so I can’t thank you anymore.”

A trace of surprise flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes. She recalled that Gu Zhou had also told her in the car that she couldn’t thank him again.

Could it be that Gu Zhou thought the same?

Qiao Nian smiled at Gu Qi. She was going to look for her other child now. She had no time to think about what Gu Zhou was thinking.

At that moment, the door opened.

Gu Qi frowned even more. She shrank back into the blanket, unwilling to reveal her true colors.

Qiao Nian turned her head and saw Gu Zhou walking in, wearing a white bathrobe. His hair was still wet.

So he had just taken a shower.

His body emerged from the steam, and there were still sparkling water droplets on his neck and chest.

Qiao Nian thought of a phrase.

The temptation of being wet!

How seductive!

Qiao Nian silently shifted her gaze and it fell on Gu Qi. She saw Gu Qi hiding under the blanket like a hermit crab, looking very insecure.

Gu Zhou’s gaze moved away from Qiao Nian’s tear-stained face. When he looked at Gu Qi, he frowned.
