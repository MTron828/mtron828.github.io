When Qiao Nian heard Qiao Xin’s question, an intimate smile appeared on her face, as if she was mocking Qiao Xin’s ignorance.

She raised her eyebrows slightly and asked, “Who else?”

A trace of confusion appeared on Qiao Xin’s face. After a long while, she said, “Before the new year, Nanshan Corporation had already risen to prominence. However, the company was in America at that time, but now it’s in the country.”

Before Qiao Xin arrived, she had already investigated the specific situation of Nanshan Corporation. That was why she was puzzled.

However, she was also afraid that she would offend Qiao Nian. Although she was questioning Qiao Nian now, she didn’t dare to criticize her.

Qiao Xin continued, “Let’s not talk about anything else. If I remember correctly, you were in a mental hospital five years ago. How could you have been related to Nanshan Corporation back then? Moreover, if an employee of Nanshan Corporation wants to climb to the position of director, it will take at least ten years.”

“You’ve never been out of the mental hospital. How could Nanshan Corporation spend money to hire someone who has been staying in the mental hospital?”

When Qiao Nian heard Qiao Xin’s words, she couldn’t help but laugh. She asked casually, “Qiao Xin, are you getting old? Is your memory failing you?”

Although Qiao Xin was very angry, she didn’t dare to show it on her face.

“What do you mean?”

“If you’re smart enough, you should know that the main business of Nanshan Corporation isn’t real estate, but the medical industry. What do you think I did in the five years I was in the mental hospital?”

When Qiao Nian said this, Qiao Xin’s face turned pale.

She had been to the mental hospital Qiao Nian was in previously. According to Qiao Nian’s attending doctor, Qiao Nian wasn’t locked up. Instead, she was planting some flowers and plants in the backyard. Those flowers and plants were all expensive herbs.

Oh my god, how had she forgotten about this?

Qiao Nian could easily earn a lot of money by selling some herbs.

She was simply too stupid to have forgotten about this.

Moreover, she remembered very clearly that Nanshan Corporation had been bought over by a mysterious person after Qiao Nian was locked up in the mental hospital.

Perhaps Nanshan Corporation had taken a liking to Qiao Nian’s talent in cultivating expensive herbs, so they made an exception and accepted her.

Qiao Xin looked at Qiao Nian’s bright and flamboyant face and pursed her lips tightly. In the past, she tried her best to torture Qiao Nian and trample her under her feet. However, she had never expected Qiao Nian to be as untainted as a lotus flower.

Before seeing Qiao Nian today, she had thought that she had successfully gotten ahead.

She still wanted to walk in front of Qiao Nian and impress her.

But now, she suddenly realized something.

She had been too silly and naive. Her thoughts were like a joke.

She looked at Qiao Nian with a complicated expression, tears welling up in her eyes.

Qiao Nian naturally noticed the change in Qiao Xin’s eyes. She knew that Qiao Xin had already understood. She probably wouldn’t do those stupid things again.

Qiao Nian retracted her gaze and said coldly, “If there’s nothing else, you can leave!”

Qiao Xin slowly retracted her gaze and walked out with her head lowered.

She suddenly felt that Qiao Nian was like a pure white and arrogant swan. Qiao Nian had never changed since she was young. No matter where she was, she would always be the shining one.

Even though she had used such despicable methods to ruin Qiao Nian’s life in the past, Qiao Nian’s vitality was so tenacious. She got up again.

The current Qiao Nian was the Young Madam of the Gu family, and the person Gu Zhou doted on.

Although she didn’t want to admit that Qiao Nian was more outstanding than her, she had to admit that perhaps she couldn’t compare to Qiao Nian from the beginning!

Back then, when she found out that Qiao Nian, a little girl from the countryside, could actually get into such a good school, jealousy took root in her heart.

In the future, she would work hard to destroy everything about Qiao Nian so that she would never be able to get up again. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Fortunately, her status was better than Qiao Nian’s.

Qiao Nian was an unwanted wretch.
