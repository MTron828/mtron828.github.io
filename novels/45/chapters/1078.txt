1079 Sophistry

When Qiao Xin heard Qiao Nian’s words, she was instantly speechless. She frowned and said unhappily, “But you weren’t hurt!”

“Didn’t it happen?” Qiao Nian let go of Gu Zhou’s arm and took a step forward, her gaze cold.

“Did I say anything wrong?” Qiao Xin looked at Qiao Nian’s pretentious expression. The more she thought about it, the angrier she became. She said angrily, “You’ve already benefited, yet you’re still pretending to be obedient!”

“I think you’ve already forgotten what happened six years ago!” Qiao Nian paused and raised her eyebrows. She continued, “You had your way six years ago, but you failed yesterday!”

!!

When Qiao Xin heard Qiao Nian’s words, she was stunned.

Was she hallucinating?

Qiao Nian had actually taken the initiative to mention what had happened six years ago!

Was Qiao Nian stupid?

However, Gu Zhou knew what had happened six years ago. How could Gu Zhou still be with Qiao Nian?

Qiao Xin had wanted to use what had happened six years ago to threaten Qiao Nian. It seemed that Qiao Nian wasn’t afraid at all!

Qiao Xin’s gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face. Gu Zhou’s expression was calm, as if he wasn’t at all puzzled by Qiao Nian’s mention of what had happened six years ago.

Did Gu Zhou care so much about Qiao Nian?

Wasn’t Gu Zhou afraid that Qiao Nian would make a cuckold of him?

Qiao Xin had been thinking about how to let Gu Zhou know about what happened six years ago. Since Qiao Nian had already brought it up, she would help explain what happened six years ago!

Qiao Xin smiled at Gu Zhou and said slowly, “Six years ago…”

“Qiao Xin!” Qiao Yu frowned and stopped her sternly.

Qiao Xin had done too many wrong things. Qiao Yu hoped that Qiao Xin could turn over a new leaf and stop making mistakes over and over again. She should stop wanting to ruin Qiao Nian’s relationship!

Qiao Yu knew very well that it would never be possible between him and Qiao Nian!

He only hoped that Qiao Nian would live a better life now. This could be considered making it up to her.

When Qiao Xin heard Qiao Yu’s voice, her expression froze. She had never expected her brother to be fierce to her because of that b*tch Qiao Nian!

Why did everyone have to stand on Qiao Nian’s side?

She was clearly the victim!

Why didn’t her brother let her explain what had happened six years ago?

Her reputation had been ruined. How could Qiao Nian still stand there unscathed?

Everyone was biased towards Qiao Nian. She was like someone who no one wanted and could only protect herself!

“Brother, don’t stop me!” Qiao Xin raised her head and looked at Qiao Yu coldly. “Since you’re not on my side, you’re no longer qualified to interfere!”

When Qiao Yu heard Qiao Xin’s words, his expression instantly darkened. It was only because of his parents’ indulgence that Qiao Xin had changed beyond recognition!

Qiao Yu raised his hand to slap Qiao Xin, but when he saw the bandage on her face, he hesitated!

Qiao Xin looked up and moved her face closer to Qiao Yu’s. Smiling coldly, she said, “Brother, haven’t you hit me enough?”

“I told you not to say anything else. Go and offer incense to Grandma!” Qiao Yu retracted his hand reluctantly and said coldly.

“If you don’t want me to say it, I want to say it more.” Qiao Xin limped forward, staring unblinkingly at Gu Zhou. “Gu Zhou, do you know why Qiao Nian went to the mental hospital?”

Without waiting for Gu Zhou to speak, Qiao Xin continued, “She looks like a normal person now. Why would a normal person go to a mental hospital? Haven’t you thought about this?”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Xin’s words, his eyes narrowed slightly. Instinctively, he held Qiao Nian’s hand and crossed his fingers. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

What happened six years ago!

Gu Zhou’s first reaction was what happened on the 15th of August!

That night, not only was he framed, but Qiao Nian was also framed. He owed Qiao Nian.

When he found out the truth about what happened on the 15th of August, he got someone to investigate Qiao Nian’s situation that night.

After an investigation, he realized that Qiao Xin had drugged Qiao Nian, causing her to lose her innocence that night!

Seeing Gu Zhou’s nervous expression, Qiao Xin couldn’t help but laugh. She continued, “Qiao Nian couldn’t stand the loneliness and had a one-night stand with an old man. After three months, Qiao Nian’s stomach became big!”

At this point, Qiao Xin couldn’t help but smile. This would make her feel happy. “She got pregnant before marriage. Our Qiao family can’t afford to lose face like this. That’s why Dad sent her to a mental hospital!”
