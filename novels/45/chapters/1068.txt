1069 Legs Were Weak

Qiao Nian felt as if she had been struck by lightning. In an instant, she was charred on the outside and tender on the inside!

His legs were f*cking weak!

She was clearly tired!

If he had known that her legs would go weak, this man would not have insisted on tormenting her for the entire night.

!!

Gu Zhou stood up and said, “I’ll bring breakfast over first. I’ll buy medicine for you after breakfast!”

Buy medicine?

Was there medicine for weak legs?

Qiao Nian’s ears turned red as she refused righteously. “There’s no need. I’m fine now. I’m almost done!”

Gu Zhou’s eyes gradually darkened. His lips curved up slightly as he asked, “Why don’t we relive what happened last night?”

“I’m a little hungry!” Qiao Nian mercilessly rejected Gu Zhou’s suggestion. If she did what she did last night again, how would she pay respects to Grandma Qiao in the afternoon?

Qiao Nian was about to change her clothes when she saw that Gu Zhou was still in the room. Frowning, she said, “Hurry up and get out. I want to change!”

Gu Zhou’s gaze lingered on Qiao Nian for a moment before he continued, “Where have I not seen before?”

Qiao Nian was speechless.

In the end, Gu Zhou was still chased out by Qiao Nian. What embarrassed Qiao Nian was that Gu Zhou had wanted to help her put on her clothes just now.

During breakfast, Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou and said, “I’m going to pay my respects to Grandma Qiao today.”

Gu Zhou stopped eating and said, “I’ll go with you!”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, her heart warmed. However, she still shook her head and said, “I’ll go myself. Go busy yourself!”

“Do you really not need me to accompany you?” Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian worriedly.

“There’s really no need. I’m not a child!” Qiao Nian smiled at Gu Zhou.

Only then did Gu Zhou say, “I’m going to the company to settle some matters today!”

“Alright, go ahead!”

After dinner, Gu Zhou left.

Qiao Nian returned to her room and was about to leave with her cell phone when her gaze fell on the medicine on the bedside table. She sighed helplessly.

Although she didn’t want to eat the medicine Gu Zhou had prepared for her at all, her throat hurt and felt terrible. She still had to eat it.

Gu Zhou understood too well now!

…

At noon, Qiao Nian drove to the Qiao family villa!

After parking the car, she got out of the car and looked at the door of the Qiao family villa with mixed feelings.

In the past, when she didn’t know her true identity, she had always yearned to return to the Qiao family in glory.

But after experiencing so much, she was no longer the same person as before. She would never treat the Qiao family as her family again.

At this moment, a middle-aged man walked out.

The man had a big head and ears, and his suit was about to burst open. When he smiled, his uneven yellow teeth were exposed!

The man was wearing a suit, but his sneakers had already torn his pants. His white shirt was also a little yellow, like a hooligan on the streets.

At this moment, the servant called him butler!

Qiao Nian frowned slightly.

Shen Hao!

Shen Hao was Su Xue’s distant relative. According to blood relations, they were completely unrelated, but because their great-grandfather was a cousin!

Back then, when she was sent to the mountains by Su Xue, Shen Hao was in charge of taking care of her!

Shen Hao was an alcoholic and a gambler!

When she was in the Shen family, Shen Hao often played cards outside. He drank and did not go home. She often ate one meal and did not eat the next.

In winter, she did not have any thick clothes, and Shen Hao was unwilling to spend money on her clothes. He kept saying that she was a piece of trash! nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Fortunately, her grandfather and senior brothers took good care of her, so she did not freeze to death and starve to death!

In the summer when she was sixteen, she was doing her homework at home in a nightdress. Shen Hao had come in drunk and thrown her onto the bed, wanting to forcefully sleep with her!

She had been learning mixed martial arts from her brother and senior brothers. She was quite skilled and kicked Shen Hao in the groin.

At that time, Shen Hao was in so much pain that he howled loudly. Perhaps it was because she had made too much noise, but she woke up Shen Hao’s wife, Xu Qiu, who was taking an afternoon nap in the room next door!
