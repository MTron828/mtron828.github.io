Gu Zhou’s dark eyes flickered. His gaze finally fell on Qiao Nian’s face, and he frowned.

“What’s wrong?” Seeing that Gu Zhou’s expression was a little off, Qiao Nian asked in a low voice.

There was a trace of anxiety in her voice, as if she was very concerned about him.

Gu Zhou shook his head gently and said nothing more.

Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. Afraid that a long delay would bring trouble, she smiled and said, “Then I’ll take her to meet Little Qi now.”

With that, Qiao Nian walked up to Su Sheng and hurriedly pulled her away from this troublesome place. She led Su Sheng straight to Gu Qi’s room.

Chen Qing watched as Second Young Madam and Doctor Su left. After the two of them left, he saw Gu Zhou walking towards the study and hurriedly followed him.

Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s footsteps leaving. She turned back and heaved a sigh of relief.

They arrived at Gu Qi’s room.

Qiao Nian knocked on the door, but didn’t hear anything. She paused for a moment, then pushed the door open and entered.

“Quardra Kill!”

Gu Qi’s fingers flew across his phone. The character he was controlling had neatly killed the last hero on the other side. The sound of “Penta Kill” came from his earpiece.

After the sound ended, he suddenly heard a knock on the door. His eyes were instantly filled with vigilance as he stuffed the phone under his pillow.

Gu Qi didn’t forget to take off his earpiece.

He was about to overturn the crystal opposite him. He wondered who had entered.

The displeasure in his eyes was obvious. He silently pulled the blanket over his legs and stole a glance at the door.

It was Auntie!

When Gu Qi saw Qiao Nian’s face, his eyes lit up. The displeasure in his eyes instantly dissipated, and his lips curved up uncontrollably.

Auntie had come to look for him!

Realizing this, Gu Qi was overjoyed.

Just as Gu Qi was about to call her, his gaze inadvertently fell on the face of the person behind Qiao Nian. The joy on his face dissipated like smoke. Silently, he pulled the blanket over his head, revealing only his eyes.

Seeing Gu Qi like this, Qiao Nian’s heart ached. This child was truly pitiful.

Su Sheng glanced at Gu Qi. She already had a plan in mind. She stood at the door and did not enter directly.

She had seen many autistic patients. Those patients cared a lot about their territory and were unwilling to let strangers into their territory.

Moreover, those autistic patients hated doctors the most.

Su Sheng stood at the door. She could still feel the disgust in the child’s eyes. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

When Qiao Nian realized that Su Sheng didn’t enter immediately, she heaved a sigh of relief. Her gaze fell on Gu Qi’s face again. She sat down by the bed and said politely, “Little Qi, Auntie wants to introduce you to a friend of mine. You can just call her Auntie Su.”

Su Sheng stood at the bedroom door, a bright smile on her face. “Little Qi, how are you? Nice to meet you!”

However, Gu Qi still did not move. He just lay there calmly, silently pulling the blanket over his head. He looked like he did not want to see her.

… .

In the study, Gu Zhou sat in front of the table, exhausted. He raised his hand to massage his temples, looking grim.

Chen Qing stood there, not daring to say a word. He glanced at Gu Zhou carefully, then lowered his head again.

Gu Zhou looked up, his dark brown eyes fixed on Chen Qing’s face. He asked calmly, “I was in the study previously. Why was I in the room?”

When Chen Qing heard Gu Zhou’s voice, his expression changed.

He was doomed. He didn’t know how to explain this to Second Young Master.

This was not the right time to tell Second Young Master that there were other personalities in his body.

“Well?”

Gu Zhou’s voice lowered, carrying a trace of scrutiny.

Chen Qing’s heart was beating faster and faster. He looked up at Gu Zhou and said carefully, “Second Young Master, you fell asleep in the study. I was afraid that you wouldn’t be able to sleep well, so I helped you back to your room.”

Gu Zhou narrowed his eyes slightly, not quite believing Chen Qing’s words. However, he recalled that Chen Qing did not have the guts to speak either. He continued, “I was not awake?”

“You didn’t look well at that time. I was worried that you would be sick…” Chen Qing’s voice trailed off.
