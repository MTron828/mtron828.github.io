Chapter 127 Pushing the Blame

Qiao Nian had sent over so many treasures. This made everyone realize that the Suranne Grass didn’t belong to Qiao Xin at all. Instead, it belonged to Qiao Nian.

Every person in the crowd was admiring these expensive plants. They all looked at Qiao Nian with respect.

Qiao Nian had never been one to be taken advantage of easily. She had no intention of letting Qiao Xin off the hook.

Qiao Nian’s beautiful fox-like eyes opened a little wider as she spoke, her words unhurried. “Qiao Xin, are you still going to insist that this pot of Suranne Grass is yours?”

Inch by inch, Qiao Xin turned her head to look at Qiao Nian. Her face was as pale as a sheet of paper. Her eyes were filled with fear and unease.

Qiao Nian pointed at the pot of Suranne Grass Qiao Xin had brought over and said with a smile, “Why don’t you give my suggestion a try? Anyway, you’ll only be ruining one pot of Suranne Grass. I’m sure Director Lin won’t feel the pinch.”

Shaking her head, Qiao Xin stepped back.

Matching her steps, Qiao Nian approached Qiao Xin, not giving her a chance to catch her breath. “Don’t worry. Although the roots of the Suranne Grass can poison you, the hospital is very near. If we send you there, the doctor will help you detoxify the poison easily. By the way, even if you’re cured, touching the roots of Suranne Grass will still cause a person’s body to be covered in festering sores. There’s no way to treat that!”

At the thought that her entire body might be covered in boils, Qiao Xin said in fear, “No, I won’t!”

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Su Yan’s face and she smiled. “Mr. Su, you can take Qiao Xin’s place.”

Su Yan’s heart leaped to his throat. He glanced at Qiao Xin, who was trembling, then at Qiao Nian, who appeared completely unruffled. The answer was clear.

So the pot of Suranne Grass really didn’t belong to Qiao Xin.

At this moment, Su Yan longed to find a hole to hide in. He had never expected Qiao Xin to do something like this!

Su Yan was utterly humiliated. He was clenching his fists so hard that the veins on the back of his hands were bulging. Cold sweat had broken out on his forehead.

Qiao Nian glanced at Su Yan’s fists. Smiling, she asked sarcastically, “Are you going to throw a tantrum? If you want to start a fight, the police station isn’t far from here either. Perhaps the police will give you a luxurious suite in prison on account of the Su family name!”

“Qiao Nian, you’re going too far!” “Mr. Su, do you not use your brain?” Qiao Nian was so angry that she began to laugh. “Aren’t you the ones going too far?”

Su Yan almost vomited blood. He couldn’t find any words to rebuke her.

Qiao Nian’s gaze finally fell on Song Hua’s face. She smiled and said, “Mr. Song, neither Su Yan nor Qiao Xin are willing to give it a try. Why don’t you give it a try? Don’t worry, if you’re poisoned, I’ll pay for your medical fees. I believe you’ll definitely be impartial. A man of your status won’t side with anyone!”

On the surface, she was praising Song Hua, but everyone present knew that Qiao Nian despised him utterly. Song Hua was so angry that his chest ached. In all his years in the medical field, this was the first time he had been rebuked by a young lass to the point of speechlessness. His reputation had been ruined.

Previously, Song Hua had sided with Qiao Xin because he had taken Qiao Shan’s money.

But now, everyone understood that Qiao Xin was the one who had stolen Qiao Nian’s Suranne Grass in order to please Director Lin.

If he still chose to stand on Qiao Xin’s side, he would only be more humiliated.

However, Gu Zhou, who was in the crowd, was gazing at Qiao Nian with admiration. To Song Hua, Qiao Nian was like a cunning little fox. No one could take advantage of her.

Song Hua’s mind raced, cold sweat breaking out on his forehead. If he took up Qiao Nian’s suggestion and ended up poisoned, his life would be over. Nothing could be more humiliating than that. He had no choice but to relent and say, “Second Young Mistress Qiao, I was in the wrong. If Qiao Xin didn’t show me that photograph, along with a false date, I would never have thought that she would lie to

me!”

Qiao Xin looked at Song Hua in disbelief and murmured, “Uncle Song…” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Song Hua’s chest continued to ache with rage. He glared at Qiao Xin and berated angrily, “Qiao Xin, you used to be a good child. Why have you become like this? I remember now. You only did this to help Mr. Su, didn’t you? But taking someone else’s things is still wrong, no matter what. Hurry up and apologize to your sister!”
