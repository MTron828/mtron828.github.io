Chapter 1788 - 1788 Be Careful (2)

Qiao Nian couldn’t bear to use it directly on stage. She thought that if she used this powder in a crowded place, she could paralyze more enemies.

Qiao Nian kept firing at her surroundings until she ran out of bullets. Only then did she change the magazine from the pocket at her waist.

Those people were drugged and their movements slowly slowed down. Qiao Nian had just finished changing her magazine when she saw with her sharp eyes that someone wanted to ambush Gu Zhou from behind.

Qiao Nian narrowed her eyes dangerously and whispered, “Be careful.”𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

With that, she ran towards that person.

However, Gu Zhou had been paying attention to the battle around him. He had long noticed the person who wanted to ambush him from behind. He raised his leg and kicked the person who wanted to ambush him away. He even almost kicked Qiao Nian, who had come to help.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou and dealt with the people around her.

“You shouldn’t have come over,” Gu Zhou said with a cold expression.

Actually, Gu Zhou had also seen Qiao Nian. That was why he had avoided her and attacked the enemy who had ambushed him.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian worriedly. In his opinion, there were not many people around Lina. Lina was very safe.

However, it was different on the president’s side. Many people wanted to catch the president and ask Cui Huai for credit, so the president’s side was very dangerous.

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she smiled and said, “Were you planning to take the opportunity to abuse me just now? Because I didn’t listen to you?”

Qiao Nian dealt with the person in front of her quickly. It seemed that the environment she was in was not dangerous at all. Instead, it was very safe.

A doting smile appeared on Gu Zhou’s solemn face. He glanced at Qiao Nian beside him and easily defeated the enemy in front of him. He said, “Mrs. Gu, you’ve wronged me. You went through so much trouble to rush over for me. I’m touched. Why would I have other thoughts?”

Qiao Nian dealt with the enemies who had barged in. She frowned slightly and said with a serious expression, “We should send the president out as soon as possible. Do you have any ideas?”

At this moment, the two of them were very close to each other. Although they had not trained together before, the two of them had a tacit understanding and kept beating the enemies who had barged in to the ground.

Gu Zhou frowned slightly and looked at the enemy in front of him with a complicated expression. Then, he looked at the president behind him and looked at the door of the castle in the distance. He shook his head and said, “The people Mark and Cui Huai brought are all good. Now that our people’s stamina has been exhausted, and there are fewer and fewer people, it’s very difficult to pass through the crowd and send the president out.”

Qiao Nian stabbed the 10-centimeter silver needle into the heart of the enemy in front of her. She watched as the enemy fell to the ground and stepped on him. Looking at the chaotic crowd not far away, she frowned and said in a low voice, “It’s too chaotic now. I can tell that all of them are extraordinary. It’s difficult for us to meet up with our people.”

“Wait a little longer. I think Mark and Cui Huai will definitely do something else,” Gu Zhou said solemnly.

Qiao Nian nodded. They had no choice but to wait slowly.

More and more enemies fell in front of Qiao Nian. She stepped on them directly. As long as she found an opportunity, she would shoot the silver needle crossbow in her hand, all of which hit everyone’s hearts.

She stood taller and saw a group of people rushing over from afar. Qiao Nian saw the face of one of them and pursed her lips slightly. She said with a serious expression, “Cui Huai is here.”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Gu Zhou nodded seriously and exchanged a look with Qiao Nian. The two of them gradually approached the president and reminded him, “Someone is coming. Protect the president.”

Seeing that the guards did not react much, Gu Zhou’s voice was cold. “They all crawled back from death. If you want to live, buck up!”

The guards around the president endured their fatigue and perked up. They protected the president behind them and said in unison, “Charge and protect the president!”
