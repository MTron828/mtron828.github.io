When she was young, she didn’t know that she wasn’t the Qiao couple’s child. All she could think about was how to go home early.

Later on, she gradually no longer cared about the Qiao family. Without Grandma, the other people in the Qiao family were very cold to her, and she no longer had any hopes of going home.

When she found out that she wasn’t a child of the Qiao family, she only wanted to find her family and reunite with them. Qiao Nian wanted to feel the warmth of a family.

Everything here was identical to the Lu family villa in An City. It was exactly the same as home.

Lu Jiang’s gentle and smiling voice came from the cell phone. “Yes, that’s good. If you need anything, just ask Su Han. He’s my personal assistant and half a butler.”

Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou walked into the villa. The living room was decorated the same way as the Lu family’s living room in An City. She had thought that it was just the same on the outside, but she didn’t expect everything inside to be the same.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but sigh. “Fourth Brother, you’ve really put in a lot of effort into renovating this place.”

“Then do you like it?”

Qiao Nian looked at the familiar scene and smiled. “Of course I like it!”

“Then I’ll give it to you!”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. Thinking that she was hallucinating, she asked in confusion, “Fourth Brother?”

“It’s for you!”

This time, Qiao Nian was certain that she hadn’t heard wrongly. She looked at her surroundings and frowned slightly.

The Water Sky Villa simply had an astronomical price. It was said that no aristocrat whose ancestors did not have much money dared to live here. Some people even said that a square meter of this place could be measured with diamonds.

This villa was very big. She could not estimate the value of this villa.

Fourth Brother was really generous.

She could tell that Fourth Brother was not joking.

Qiao Nian hesitated for a moment and said, “Fourth Brother, this isn’t appropriate!”

Lu Jiang’s gentle voice came from the cell phone.

“Miss, what’s mine is yours. Don’t you like this villa?”

Qiao Nian really didn’t know what to say.

She liked everything here, but this villa was really too expensive.

Before Qiao Nian could think of what to say, she heard Lu Jiang say.

“I’ll get Su Han to handle this later. Now, we just need to sign an electronic agreement.”

Qiao Nian was indeed very rich, but now that she was about to be given such a valuable thing, she was still a little stunned.

“Fourth Brother, this… this is too fast!”

When Lu Jiang heard Qiao Nian’s soft murmur, her adorable face appeared in his mind. His eyes were filled with smiles as he said, “You’re home. I wanted to prepare a gift for you to begin with. Since you like this villa, take it as my greeting gift to you!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Qiao Nian looked around and teased, “Fourth Brother, if Qi Qi finds out about this, she’ll be sad.”

“You’re not the only one. Qi Qi has one. Song Yu has one too.”

When Qiao Nian heard Fourth Brother say “Song Yu”, she was slightly stunned, but she quickly recovered. It seemed that Song Yu was still very well liked in the Lu family.

“So?”

“I’ve already thought about it. When the time comes, I’ll buy one for Qi Qi and one for Song Yu.” As Lu Jiang spoke, he paused for a moment and finally added, “Everyone in the family should own one. That way, we can live together when we travel together.”

Qiao Nian was shocked.

The Water Sky Villa was an expensive villa. The property prices here were one of the best in the world. From Fourth Brother’s casual tone, it was as if this expensive villa was as worthless as cabbage and could be bought casually.

How rich was Fourth Brother?

If Fourth Brother really bought so many Water Sky Villas, this villa area could just be renamed the Lu family villa area. After all, they would all be occupied by the Lu family.

“Fourth Brother, don’t be so scary. I’m going to pack my things!” Qiao Nian didn’t want to continue the conversation.

“Alright, then rest early after packing. I’ll accompany Xiao Qi and the others.” Lu Jiang smiled and nodded.

“Okay.” Qiao Nian immediately hung up and heaved a sigh of relief.

Gu Zhou had also just received a call. He walked into the living room. His gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face and he quickly walked over.
