“Oh my god, Senior Xia Xue is really too kind!”

“No wonder Mr. Dong Hua chose her. Who wouldn’t like a good person who’s beautiful, kind, and does both?”

“Yes, yes. We have to learn from Senior Xia Xue in the future.”

…

When Wang Xuan heard these words, she couldn’t help but feel like vomiting.

Where did this woman get her courage from?

She was actually so blindly confident.

She really didn’t know how he cultivated to be so thick-skinned.

How could someone like Xia Xue say that Nian Nian wanted to replace her?

Was she worthy?

Wang Xuan looked at Xia Xue expressionlessly and asked, “Why can’t we come here in the future? Is this your private place? And what right do you have to say that we came here to attract Brother Cao’s attention? Also, you said that the tune just now was played by a stereo. Are you immortal, or do you have special abilities and X-ray vision?”

When Gao Lin heard Wang Xuan’s continuous questions, she instantly felt that Wang Xuan was very stupid. She didn’t even want to stoop to the level of an idiot like Wang Xuan, but for Senior Xia Xue’s sake, she still said, “I’m sorry, I’m just stating the facts!”

Qiao Nian looked at Gao Lin coldly. Slowly, she took out her violin and placed it on her left shoulder. Her beautiful fox-like eyes were cold. “Whether I am or not, it’s not up to you to decide.”

Everyone looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief.

What did Qiao Nian mean? Was she going to play the violin in front of everyone?

Was she trying to prove her innocence?

Oh my god!

Everyone stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian. They were truly curious. Had Qiao Nian played the music recording just now, or had she played it herself?

Qiao Nian didn’t waste any more time. She slowly closed her eyes and began to bow the violin.

The familiar music began again.

Everyone looked at Qiao Nian in shock. Wasn’t this the music they had just heard?

Could it really be Qiao Nian?

The tune was as gentle and delicate as ever, carrying a strong sense of longing. Anyone who heard it would be heartbroken.

Gao Lin stood rooted to the ground, her eyes wide open. She looked at Qiao Nian in shock.

How… how was this possible?

Qiao Nian was just a freshman, and she was just a country bumpkin. She had studied all her music on her own. How could she play such a beautiful violin song?

This was impossible!

This was absolutely impossible!

Even though Gao Lin had seen Qiao Nian play the violin with her own eyes, she refused to believe that Qiao Nian knew how to play the violin well.

Xia Xue, who was standing at the side, grew paler and paler. Her breathing gradually became erratic, and her legs felt a little weak. If she hadn’t been supporting herself against the wall, she might have collapsed.

Xia Xue’s heart gradually sank into the abyss. Tears welled up in her eyes, and she fought back her tears.

She had also played this song in front of Brother Cao. It was clearly the same song, but her song had no emotions to speak of. Moreover, she couldn’t play it well at all.

At this moment, she knew that she had lost.

She knew very well that Brother Cao was looking for Qiao Nian.

When Qiao Nian finished the last note, she slowly opened her eyes. Her eyes were filled with sorrow as she placed the violin back into the case.

After a long while, everyone came back to their senses. They wiped their tears and began to cheer and applaud.

These voices were like an invisible hand slapping Xia Xue and Gao Lin hard in the face.

Xia Xue’s heart felt as if it had been pierced by countless needles. It hurt so much that her heart couldn’t beat. She looked at everyone looking at Qiao Nian with admiration, and the hatred in her heart grew more and more obvious. The admiration in everyone’s eyes should have been directed at her.

Qiao Nian!

It was all Qiao Nian’s fault!

Qiao Nian had stolen all the glory that belonged to her!

Xia Xue clenched her fists involuntarily. For the first time, she had the urge to destroy someone.

Xia Xue’s mind raced as she thought about how to deal with Qiao Nian.

At this moment, a feminine voice came from the door.

“Why are you all gathered here?”
