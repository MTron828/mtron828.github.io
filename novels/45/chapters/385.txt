Chapter 386: Big Gossip

Then, a look of joy appeared on Qin Lu’s face. She looked at Gu Zhou excitedly and said, “You know that I was wronged. Then, that means that you believe what I said. You also believe that all of this was planned by Jiang Yue, right? Actually, I’m just a victim.”

Seeing that Gu Zhou had not said anything, Qin Lu had a bad feeling. She asked nervously, “Does that mean you won’t hurt me?”

Gu Zhou had never been a fool who was fooled by others. According to his understanding of Jiang Yue, this matter was most likely done by her.

That did not mean that Qin Lu was innocent.

Gu Zhou looked down at Qin Lu and asked calmly, “Which hand did you use to snatch the phone away?”

Qin Lu was slightly stunned, not understanding what Gu Zhou was talking about.

A phone. What phone?

How could she have snatched a phone?

“In school,” Gu Zhou reminded kindly.

Qin Lu’s nervous heart instantly rose to her throat. She looked at Gu Zhou anxiously and stammered, “I, I…”

“Since your memory is so bad, I’ll just make a random guess…” Gu Zhou took the fruit knife from the side and waved it in front of Qin Lu.

“No, no…” Qin Lu screamed.

“Or did you snatch it with both hands?” As Gu Zhou spoke, he held the fruit knife in his hand and measured it in front of Qin Lu, as if he wanted to chop off both of Qin Lu’s hands.

Qin Lu was already trembling in fear. She fell to the ground and pleaded with a trembling voice, “Qiao Nian has already made me pay the price. I really know my mistake!”

After saying that, Qin Lu seemed to have thought of something. She knelt on the ground and kowtowed to Gu Zhou without hesitation. “Please let me go. I really didn’t know that you knew that child.”

“You bullied my child. How can I let this go before I personally teach you a lesson?”

Qin Lu sat up straight and looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief.

“What?” Qin Lu’s eyes widened.

Gu Qi.

It was actually Gu Zhou’s child.

Both of their surnames were Gu.

Why hadn’t she thought of so much then?

The waiter, who had been hiding by the bed, also poked his head out curiously, completely ignoring the panic in his heart.

Gu Zhou actually had a child. This was huge news!

If this news were to spread…

“AHHHHH!!!”

The waiter’s thoughts were interrupted by Qin Lu’s scream.

Only then did the waiter see that Qin Lu’s right shoulder had been cut by the fruit knife in Gu Zhou’s hand, and he could vaguely see her white bones.

The waiter peed his pants.

Qin Lu screamed in pain and kept rolling around.

This time, she was really going to be crippled.

However, Gu Zhou’s expression was calm, as if these matters had nothing to do with him. He calmly took out a piece of paper from the table and wiped the blood off the fruit knife.

His cold gaze landed on the waiter not far away. Then, he looked at Qin Lu, who had fallen to the ground and was about to faint from the pain. Her thin lips parted slightly. “If I find out about Gu Qi’s background from irrelevant people, I’ll cut off your tongues next time.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Gu Zhou’s voice was calm, but his words made people shudder.

The waiter swore with a trembling voice, “Mr. Gu, I will never tell anyone. If I do, I’ll be struck by lightning and die a horrible death!”

Qin Lu supported her body and said, “I, I won’t tell anyone even if I die…”

Gu Zhou casually threw the fruit knife on the table and slowly walked out.

Qin Lu looked at Gu Zhou’s back, her eyes filled with despair.

Why?

Why had it become like this?

Gu Qi was clearly the child of a security guard. How did he suddenly become the young master of the Gu family?
