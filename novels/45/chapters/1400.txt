1401 Impossible

The more Matriarch Lu spoke, the angrier she became. “I know him best. He never looks at other women. It’s never possible for him to betray me!”

When Uncle Zhao heard Matriarch Lu’s powerful words, his mind was in a mess. He hugged his head with both hands and shouted in pain.

Uncle Zhao’s current state stunned everyone. Qiao Nian hurriedly helped Matriarch Lu take a step back and stood in front of her, shielding her behind her.

Uncle Zhao knelt on the ground in pain.

Seeing Uncle Zhao like this, Auntie Cao’s eyes turned red. She hurriedly rushed forward and said, “Old Zhao, Old Zhao, what’s wrong?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Lu Zhu looked at Uncle Zhao, who was lying on the ground, in shock. He frowned tightly. He could not believe that Uncle Zhao was really a traitor.

Uncle Zhao used to dote on Qi Qi a lot. How could he let Qi Qi be hurt?

Lu Nian didn’t dare to believe what he was seeing either. He asked, “Uncle Zhao, why did you do this?”

Uncle Zhao rolled on the ground with a headache. He tossed and turned, cold sweat breaking out on his forehead. Auntie Cao could only watch anxiously.

Qiao Nian looked at Uncle Zhao’s current situation, her eyes filled with confusion. She took out a silver needle from her bag and pricked Uncle Zhao’s head.

Uncle Zhao’s struggles grew weaker and weaker. In the end, he fainted to the ground.

Auntie Cao looked at Uncle Zhao, who had fainted, with teary eyes. She looked at Qiao Nian uneasily and asked curiously, “Eldest Miss, what’s wrong with him?”

Qiao Nian didn’t answer Auntie Cao immediately. Instead, she picked up Uncle Zhao’s hand and took his pulse. Uncle Zhao’s pulse was normal, exactly the same as that of an ordinary person. There was nothing wrong with him at all.

She frowned slightly and looked at Uncle Zhao in confusion.

Auntie Cao, who was sitting at the side, saw Qiao Nian frown. She had also heard that Eldest Miss’s medical skills were very good. Her eyes turned red. “Eldest Miss, is Old Zhao sick?”

Qiao Nian didn’t speak. Slowly, she put Uncle Zhao’s hand down. She looked up at Auntie Cao and asked, “Auntie Cao, you’re close to Uncle Zhao. Have you noticed anything abnormal about him recently?”

Auntie Cao raised her hand to wipe her tears. She sniffled and said, “We just had a physical examination last month. Everyone is fine. There’s nothing abnormal…”

“I’m not talking about his health.” Qiao Nian interrupted Auntie Cao. After some thought, she said, “What about his words and actions?”

“This…” Auntie Cao hesitated for a moment, her frown deepening. Only then did she say, “In the past, he was bent on repaying Master and Matriarch’s kindness, but starting from last month, he began to say some muddle-headed things.”

“Yes?”

“He kept talking about his parents and his deceased wife. He even said that they were all killed by Master. I thought he was senile. I told him once or twice that his parents had died of old age, but he didn’t seem to listen at all.”

The more Auntie Cao spoke, the more helpless she became. She frowned. “He even insisted that his deceased wife had an affair. Previously, he thought that his deceased wife was with his neighbor. He even said that his deceased wife had done something wrong before God took her life. I never expected him to begin to misunderstand that his deceased wife’s car accident was caused by Master. I…”

With a plop, Auntie Cao knelt in front of Matriarch Lu and begged bitterly, “Matriarch Lu, I don’t know what’s wrong with Old Zhao either. Perhaps he’s really senile. There’s something wrong with his mind. Please let him off!”

Qiao Nian slowly stood up and walked up to Matriarch Lu. She couldn’t help but see Matriarch Lu’s sad eyes. She glanced at everyone and said, “Uncle Zhao’s condition is a little strange. Lock him up first. We’ll talk after we investigate thoroughly. Grandma, what do you think?”

When Matriarch Lu heard Qiao Nian’s words, she looked up at her and nodded. In a low voice, she said, “Go and investigate! Alright, everyone, leave!”

Qiao Nian helped Matriarch Lu back to her room. When only the two of them were left in the room, Matriarch Lu seemed to have all her strength drained. She sat on the sofa in the room, exhausted.

“Grandma, you’ve just recovered from a serious illness. You should rest more,” Qiao Nian advised gently.

When Matriarch Lu heard Qiao Nian’s words, she patted the empty seat beside her and said gently to Qiao Nian, “Sugar, come and sit.”
