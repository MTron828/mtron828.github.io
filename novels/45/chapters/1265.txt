1266 Wanting to Integrate

When Xiao Bao heard Chang Feng’s words, he suddenly recalled how he had helped Mommy today.

At that time, he wanted to save his mommy and shot the back of that baddie’s hand.

The more Xiao Bao thought about it, the more he felt that he must not have learned how to play games well.

Xiao Bao said excitedly, “Uncle Feng, I have to work hard to play games well. In the future, I can play games with Brother and Sister!”

When Chang Feng heard Xiao Bao’s words, a trace of helplessness flashed in his eyes.

Ever since Xiao Bao saw Nian’er, he had asked him a lot about her when he got home. He could tell that Xiao Bao missed his mother.

He told him some things about Nian’er. He couldn’t help but tell him that Xiao Bao had a brother and sister.

All these years, he had been paying attention to Nian’er. He knew everything about her like the back of his hand.

When Xiao Bao found out that he still had a brother and sister, he was so excited that he didn’t want to do his homework at all. He pulled him along and insisted that he download the game.

Xiao Bao had thought that he was an only child. Later on, when he found out that he still had his brother and sister, he yearned to fly back to An City immediately to be with them.

When Chang Feng found out about this, he regretted it so much that his hair was about to turn white. He hurriedly comforted Xiao Bao and let him interact with his brother and sister online first. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

After his investigation, he realized that Gu Qi and Xiao Shi liked to play games, so he downloaded a game for Xiao Bao and told him Gu Qi and Xiao Shi’s IDs.

Xiao Bao began to play games, but his skills were really too lousy.

He had worked hard to complete the novice mission and level up. When he could add his brother and sister as friends, he started to add them. However, he was blocked.

Xiao Bao was so sad that he continued to play the game. He just wanted to have something to say when he was with his brother and sister in the future.

However, he had worked very hard to play games, but his game skills were really too lousy…

At this moment, Chang Feng’s phone rang. Seeing that Xiao Bao was still persevering in his game, he took out his phone and opened it. The cell phone page was filled with red numbers.

Chang Feng looked at the numbers carefully and realized that there was Nian’er’s code.

Could something have happened to Nian’er?

With this thought in mind, Chang Feng hurriedly translated the code. When he translated and saw the contents, he was slightly stunned.

Chang Feng looked at the message, then at Xiao Bao, who was playing games beside him. He fell into deep thought.

He hesitated. Why had Qiao Nian discovered Xiao Bao’s ID so early? Was it because the two children were too vigilant and had told Qiao Nian a strange ID directly, or was it because Qiao Nian was very wary of unfamiliar accounts?

Or had they let their guard down recently?

Chang Feng knew in his heart that even if he didn’t help Qiao Nian investigate this ID, it wouldn’t be long before Qiao Nian found out about them.

If Qiao Nian continued to investigate, she might even find Xiao Bao.

Xiao Bao had just died again. Seeing Chang Feng staring at him, he smiled and asked, “Uncle Feng, why are you looking at me like that? Could it be that Xiao Bao’s face says that he’s very stupid?”

Chang Feng smiled. Suddenly, a bold thought appeared in his mind. He reached out and patted Xiao Bao’s head. Smiling, he asked, “Xiao Bao, don’t be sad. Why don’t I get your mommy to play games with you?”

Xiao Bao’s pupils instantly dilated. He looked at Chang Feng in disbelief, his voice trembling. “Uncle Feng, is what you said true?”

“When has Uncle Feng ever lied to you?” Chang Feng smiled at Xiao Bao and said gently, “Wait for me for a while. I’ll get your mommy to add you!”

Xiao Bao immediately jumped up and was excited for a while. Seeing that Chang Feng had already sent the message, he asked, “Uncle Feng, let me tell you, I’m very lousy at it. Will Mommy think that I’m very stupid?”

He didn’t want his mother to think that he was stupid. He hoped that he would be an obedient, adorable, and smart child in his mommy’s heart.

Chang Feng had been thinking about how to stop Xiao Bao from directly revealing his identity. When he heard Xiao Bao’s words, he smiled and said, “Don’t worry, I’ll tell your mommy when the time comes that I’m the one playing the game. Your mommy won’t think you’re stupid.”
