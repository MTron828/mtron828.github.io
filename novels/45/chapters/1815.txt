Chapter 1816 - 1816 Sorry

Old Master Qin glanced at the three children again. In the past, the three of them had run around the courtyard. In the blink of an eye, they had already grown up.

Perhaps because they were older now, even if he left, the three of them would live happily and easily.

Qin Chuan looked at the three people in front of him and gradually slowed down. He whispered to Lu Qi beside him, “Qiqi.”

“Huh?” Lu Qi smiled at Qin Chuan. Seeing that he wanted to say something but hesitated, he stopped in his tracks. “Senior, what’s wrong?”

Qin Chuan stopped and hesitated for a long time. In the end, he said seriously, “Qiqi, I’m really sorry when we were in the ward just now.”

Only then did Lu Qi remember that when Senior was in the ward just now, he had said that she was his fiancée. She lowered her head and was at a loss.

“Senior…” Lu Qi looked up at Qin Chuan and met those sincere eyes. “Just now…”

However, before she could finish speaking, her hand was held by Qin Chuan. She immediately became nervous and did not know what to say.

Actually, she had a good impression of Senior. If she really got together with Senior in the future, it would actually not be bad.

At least, the moment Senior held her hand, she felt her heart skip a beat, then beat violently again.

Qin Chuan saw that Lu Qi had his head lowered and did not retract his hand. He held his hand tightly and his lips curled into a faint smile. He called out softly, “Qiqi.”

Lu Qi subconsciously nodded and looked at Qin Chuan.

“Thank you for being my fiancée.”

Lu Qi was slightly stunned and blinked in confusion.

What was going on?

She didn’t say anything.

What was Senior saying?

Lu Qi quickly retracted her hand, but Qin Chuan’s grip was too tight. However, she was a little afraid. “Senior, I’m going to school.”

As soon as Qin Chuan let go, Lu Qi retracted his hand.

Lu Qi looked at Qiao Nian, who was not far away, and quickly said, “Sister, I have something on at school. I’ll go get busy.”

Qiao Nian turned to look at Lu Qi. Before she could speak, Lu Qi had already run away.

Qiao Nian saw Qin Chuan standing there in a daze, looking at Lu Qi’s back. She walked to Qin Chuan’s side and said, “Old Qin, did you scare my sister away?”

“You’re accusing me wrongly. I didn’t do anything,” Qin Chuan said sincerely.

“Do you think I’ll believe you?” Qiao Nian smiled and looked at Qin Chuan. She glanced at Old Master Qin and said, “I’m going home. Stay with Grandpa.”

Chang Feng walked over and said to Qin Chuan, “I’ll send Nian Nian off.”

Qin Chuan nodded. “Okay.”

Chang Feng and Qiao Nian waited for Old Master Qin and Qin Chuan to enter the elevator before walking towards the parking lot.

Chang Feng habitually opened the door of the front passenger seat first. He waited for Qiao Nian to get in before closing the door.

Qiao Nian watched as Chang Feng walked from the front of the car to the driver’s seat. When she was young, Eldest Senior Brother had also taken care of her so considerately.

Chang Feng stepped on the accelerator.

At the thought of seeing the three children soon, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but feel a little excited. She said happily, “I think they should have seen the children already since they got home first. The three of them even told me that they missed us and hoped that we could go home early. They must be very happy when we get home this time.”

Actually, she also missed her three children very much. Previously, it was not easy for her family to reunite, but because of what happened more than 20 years ago, she could only travel far away.

Although Mark had been arrested, there was no time to interrogate him about what had happened more than 20 years ago. It would probably not be long before the president investigated everything.

Chang Feng had a gentle smile on his face. “Yes, I haven’t seen Xiao Bao, Xiao Qi, and Xiao Shi in a long time.”

Just as Qiao Nian was about to speak, she saw Chang Feng’s expression turn solemn. The corners of her lips gradually drooped. She frowned slightly and asked, “Eldest Senior Brother, what are you worried about?”
The red light came on.

Chang Feng stopped the car and looked at Qiao Nian beside him. His eyes curved. “It’s nothing. I’m just very happy to think that we’ve resolved those dangers.”Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Qiao Nian looked at Chang Feng’s gentle appearance. In the past few years, when he was in MY, he must have had a hard time every day.

However, Eldest Senior Brother did not seem to have said any of this.

If it were anyone else, they might have believed what Eldest Senior Brother said. However, Qiao Nian didn’t believe him at all, because she knew him too well.
