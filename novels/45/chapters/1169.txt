Su Yan nodded and took Qiao Nian’s hand before getting into the car.

Thank you readers!

As for the rest of the Lu family, they followed silently. Gu Zhou also drove after them.

In less than half an hour, everyone arrived at the hospital where Dr. Shen was.

This was a sanatorium, and also the best sanatorium in An City. Most of the people in it were elderly.

Most of the old people who lived here had no children.

Some old people had sent them in because their children were too busy to take care of them.

It was Tuesday today. Usually, no one visited at this time.

The appearance of the Lu family instantly attracted the attention of many old people.

This sanatorium was run by Su Yan’s junior brother, Li Jun. Li Jun knew that Su Ying was coming over and had been waiting at the door for a long time.

Su Yan and Li Jun walked in front. Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou walked behind, holding hands. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Qiao Nian watched as the old people gathered together to play a game of eagle catching chicken. In a daze, she recalled her previous life in the mental hospital.

Gu Zhou looked at the old people. Some were playing games, some were sitting on the ground in a daze, and some were sitting on the ground playing with mud. He frowned.

He had previously found out that Qiao Nian had lived in a mental hospital for a period of time. Most of the old people here were mentally normal. The old people in the mental hospital must be in even worse condition.

At the thought of this, his heart couldn’t help but ache for Qiao Nian!

Gu Zhou held Qiao Nian’s hand tightly, his fingers gently caressing her thumb, as if comforting her.

Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou and smiled.

“How has Teacher been recently?” Su Yan turned to look at Li Jun and asked.

After all, he was the director of the sanatorium, and Teacher Shen was his teacher. He often took care of Teacher Shen, so when he heard Su Yan’s question, he couldn’t help but sigh.

“Senior Sister, I think Teacher’s condition isn’t good!”

“Is there something wrong with his medical report?” Su Yan looked at Li Jun nervously.

“No, I don’t think teacher is in a good state of mind. He seems to be sleepwalking. The nurse on duty realized that he kept walking towards the rooftop in the middle of the night and even wanted to jump down from it. I specially hired two nurses to take turns taking care of teacher. If they weren’t careful, teacher might really have fallen off the building and died!”

“Looks like Teacher’s condition is worse than before!” Su Yan said with a frown.

“Everyone’s situation is different. I just hope Teacher can be fine now,” Su Yan comforted.

“I think so too. Senior Sister, when you see Teacher later, pay more attention to his condition. If there’s anything wrong with him, hurry up and come out of the ward. Not only does Teacher have a sleepwalking problem now, but he often uses a stool to beat up the nurses who take care of him!” Li Jun couldn’t help but sigh. If he hadn’t doubled the salary of the nurses, they wouldn’t be willing to take care of Teacher!

Su Yan frowned. “Is his condition so bad now?”

“Yes, I’ve also specially invited doctors over to take a look. Those doctors were all helpless.”

When Su Yan heard this, she nodded.

About fifteen minutes later, everyone arrived at Dr. Shen’s room.

Everyone stood at the door of the room and saw a nurse holding a bowl chasing after Doctor Shen, wanting to feed him.

However, Dr. Shen was like a child, curled up in a corner, playing with the Rubik’s Cube in his hand. He ignored the nurse.

Li Jun pushed open the door. When the nurse saw that Li Jun had arrived, she hurriedly stood up. “Hello, Director. Dr. Shen is unwilling to eat again.”

“Go ahead. I’ll feed him later.” Li Jun waited for the nurse to leave before saying to Su Yan, “I’ll feed teacher first.”

“Let me do it. If you have anything to do, go ahead!” Su Yan smiled and picked up the porridge at the side. After Li Jun left, she carried the bowl to Dr. Shen.

“Teacher, do you want some porridge?” Su Yan walked up to Doctor Shen with a gentle voice.
