847 Something’s Wrong

In Qiao Nian’s opinion, other than her grandfather and senior brothers, Matriarch Gu was the first outsider to treat her well.

She was very grateful to Matriarch Gu for treating her well. That was why she was willing to treat Matriarch Gu well.

However, Xiao Feng was a little strange today.

She had interacted with Xiao Feng before. Xiao Feng was a little cold and didn’t like to talk to others.

In the eyes of the other servants, Xiao Feng was a solitary and cautious person.

She believed that Xiao Feng might help Matriarch Gu buy medicine for her own good.

But there was a huge loophole.

Xiao Feng was a university student. It was impossible for her to casually buy medicine on the streets. She probably wouldn’t be fooled by such fake publicity.

Moreover, Xiao Feng’s apology just now was incoherent, and her words were full of loopholes.

Xiao Feng looked anxious and uneasy, completely different from usual.

What exactly had gone wrong?

Qiao Nian felt that it was necessary to investigate.

Qiao Nian comforted Matriarch Gu and coaxed her to rest. Only then did she stand up and leave.

When she came out of Matriarch Gu’s room, she saw Gu Zhou standing at the door.

Seeing that Qiao Nian had come out, Gu Zhou didn’t say anything. He walked towards the study, signaling for Qiao Nian to follow him. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

When they arrived at Gu Zhou’s study, the two of them sat on the sofa. Gu Zhou found the surveillance video on his phone and handed it to Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian took the phone from Gu Zhou. When she saw the surveillance video, her expression changed.

“Xiao Feng’s condition isn’t right!”

In the surveillance video, Xiao Feng stood in front of the table in a daze, staring blankly ahead. Even when someone greeted her, she did not react.

Qiao Nian had previously known that Xiao Feng was a cold person and didn’t have a good relationship with the other servants.

Due to Xiao Feng’s personality, when she was working part-time and studying in the past, her boss would dock her salary. No one helped Xiao Feng collect her debts.

The university Xiao Feng had been admitted to was not good, and her major was not good either. Hence, when she came out to look for a job, she encountered many obstacles. She could not find a high-paying job. In the end, she stayed in the Gu family villa as a servant.

Qiao Nian continued watching the video. In the video, Xiao Feng stood rooted to the ground in a daze for a long time. Then, she raised her hands mechanically and placed the pills into a cup. When the pills had completely dissolved in the water, she held the cup and walked towards Matriarch Gu’s room with a blank expression.

Qiao Nian’s surveillance video was very clear.

Hence, she could see Xiao Feng’s every expression clearly.

At this moment, Xiao Feng was being controlled like a puppet.

Qiao Nian handed the phone to Gu Zhou and said with a frown, “I thought that Xiao Feng poisoned Grandma on purpose. Now, it seems that there’s more to this!”

“Just now, Xiao Feng kept apologizing. She kept kowtowing until her head hurt, but she didn’t seem to feel any pain. She cried and told me everything that had happened!” The more Qiao Nian thought about it, the more she felt that something was wrong with Xiao Feng. “Have you already sent her to the police station?”

“No, I got the butler to send her somewhere else. I plan to investigate thoroughly first.” Gu Zhou felt that Xiao Feng was very likely to be someone else’s scapegoat. He would not wrong a good person, nor would he let a bad person off.

Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief and said, “I don’t think we should send her to the police station for the time being either. It’s obvious that Xiao Feng is being controlled. We have to investigate thoroughly. Otherwise, Grandma might be hurt!”

Gu Zhou thought so too.

The matters at home temporarily came to an end. Gu Zhou asked the butler to investigate the other servants. He wanted to see who was scheming.

Gu Zhou was preparing to fight for custody of Xiao Shi. He asked Chen Qing to find a lawyer to organize the information about Xiao Shi.

Seeing that Gu Zhou was busy, Qiao Nian said goodbye to him and turned to leave.

Qiao Nian wanted to go to school to take a look. She took out her phone and prepared to navigate to An University to take a look.

At this moment, her phone rang. Seeing that it was a message from Qin Chuan, she casually opened it.

When she saw the contents, her lips curved into a cold smile. The smile did not reach her eyes.
