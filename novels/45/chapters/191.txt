Chapter 192: Divorce Certificate

Qiao Yu’s gaze fell on Qiu Nan, who was curled up in a corner. A trace of coldness flashed in his eyes. He turned back to look at Qiao Nian and said, “If you could find out what Mom did, do you think I didn’t?”

“So?” Qiao Nian said, her voice nonchalant.

In Qiao Nian’s opinion, it was only natural that Qiao Yu knew about this. After all, Qiao Yu was a ruthless and scheming person!

Qiao Yu took out a folder from his bag and handed it to Qiao Nian. He said coldly, “Take a look for yourself.”

Qiao Shan and Qiao Xin walked over curiously.

Qiao Nian opened it. Much to her disbelief, she saw two divorce certificates. She had never expected Qiao Shan and Su Xue to have already gotten a divorce.

“They’re divorced?” Qiao Nian frowned a little.

As for Qiao Shan himself, he was also stunned. He didn’t even know when he had gotten a divorce with Su Xue.

Qiao Xin’s eyes instantly turned red. She looked at Qiao Yu in confusion and asked curiously, “Brother, what exactly is going on? When did Mom and Dad get divorced?”

Su Xue, who was hiding under the blanket, was trembling. Seeing everyone’s surprised gazes, she finally tugged a bathrobe over and put it on. Standing up, she walked over shakily and glanced at the documents, her gaze humbled.

With just one glance, Su Xue froze.

How could this be?

Why didn’t she herself know that she had divorced Qiao Shan?

As if she were a lunatic, Su Xue snatched the folder away and flipped it open. She looked at the photographs attached, then glanced at the stamp of the Civil Affairs Bureau. Her mind was in a mess.

After a long while, Su Xue finally recovered. A despairing smile appeared on her face as she murmured, “Qiao Yu, I didn’t get a divorce with your father. Did you get the police to make a fake certificate?”

Qiao Yu frowned impatiently. His tone was cold as he said disdainfully, “Mom, don’t you know the law? If you fake a certificate, you’ll go to jail.”” How could I make such a mistake?”

Su Xue felt as if she had been struck by lightning. The divorce certificate fell to the ground just like that. She collapsed to the ground, her tears falling uncontrollably.

Qiao Shan was still in a daze. His emotions were in a mess.

“I found out about you and Qiu Nan half a year ago, but for the sake of your reputation, I didn’t say anything. After that, I got someone to investigate and confirmed that you and Qiu Nan were together. I’ve always been worried that this matter, once discovered, would be used against you. The consequences would be unimaginable, so I helped you get a divorce in advance,” Qiao Yu said calmly, his manner as casual as though he was commenting on the weather.

When Su Xue heard Qiao Yu’s words, she suddenly recalled something. Half a year ago, Qiao Yu had indeed asked his secretary to send over a document for her and Qiao Shan to sign. He had told them that it had to do with the company and had asked them to prepare an identification photo each.

At that time, she hadn’t even looked at it before signing it.

Su Xue looked at Qiao Yu with tears streaming down her face. She had never expected her son, the child she doted on the most, and the child whom she was the proudest of, to set her up.

She was his biological mother!

How could he scheme against her?

Su Xue looked at Qiao Yu with an aggrieved expression. “How could you? How could you secretly get us divorced?”

“If I hadn’t done that, Qiao Nian would be able to send you to prison right now,” Qiao Yu said expressionlessly.

Su Xue was rendered speechless.

Qiao Yu looked at Qiao Shan and said in a much gentler tone, “Dad, I know you like to avoid conflict. You never make a fuss about anything with Mom. But this matter is too big. If we didn’t make a decision, our entire family would be implicated, so I could only secretly make the decision for you. A divorce is the best solution for both of you.”
