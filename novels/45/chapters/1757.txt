Chapter 1758 - 1758 Conciliation

The President looked at the photo and recalled what Lina had told him about Qiao Nian. He pursed his lips and said, “Miss Qiao, my tone wasn’t good just now. I’m sorry.”

“Lina told me a lot about you previously. She loves you very much. Mark is scheming, so it’s normal if you fail. You and Mr. Gu have helped me a lot. No matter what, I shouldn’t take my anger out on you because of that matter.”

When Qiao Nian heard the President’s words, she smiled and shook her head. Then, she said seriously, “President, actually, you don’t have to say anything. I understand. Lina was captured by Mark this time. It’s my fault for not planning this well. I also have a child. To parents, a child’s safety is the most important. You’re already being magnanimous by not locking me up directly just now.”

When the President heard Qiao Nian’s words, he looked at her in admiration. Thinking of what he had just done, he slowly lowered his eyes.

Qiao Nian was about the same age as Lina. This was the first time he had seen such a brave and resourceful girl. Lina and Qiao Nian were good friends. Actually, this was also Lina’s luck. He really shouldn’t have any reason to speculate about Qiao Nian’s character.

The two of them reconciled after a few words.

Not long after, the butler came in again and said, “Mr. President, Earl Mark and the others have already arrived in the living room outside.”

The president’s expression instantly tensed. He pursed his lips and walked out.

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian looked at each other and followed.

When everyone arrived at the living room outside, they saw Mark wearing medieval clothes and sitting on the sofa with his legs crossed.

When Mark and the president’s eyes met, everyone could see the anger between them.

Mark pursed his lips slightly and tilted his head to the side. “Sit!”

The president was very unhappy that Mark had taken the initiative. He said coldly, “This is my house.”

The president sat opposite Mark with a dark expression.

Mark’s gaze landed on Qiao Nian. Last night, Qiao Nian and Lina had sneaked into his castle. Qiao Nian had jumped down from the window on the second floor without being injured. She was really skilled.

The President noticed that Mark had been staring at Qiao Nian. He raised his hand and waved it in front of Mark. He went straight to the point. “Where’s Lina? When will you let Lina go? Lina didn’t commit a crime. It’s wrong for you to detain Lina privately.”

Hearing the President say this, Mark suppressed his laughter and leaned lazily on the sofa. He looked up at the guard beside him and said calmly, “There’s a reason.”

When the guard heard Mark’s words, he turned around and walked out. Then, he escorted a pale and weak Lina in. He held a knife in a sealed bag and quickly walked in.

Lina had not rested well last night and had been having nightmares over and over again. Her skin was pale and there were dark circles under her eyes.

The President looked at Lina and frowned. “How dare you torture my daughter?”

Mark said innocently, “Although your daughter has already committed a heinous crime, we didn’t torture her. She didn’t sleep well.”

Qiao Nian looked at Lina with heartache and reminded her in a low voice, “Mark wants to frame Lina for Song Ling’s death.”

The guard placed the dagger in the sealed bag on the table and said methodically, “Mr. President, last night, we heard a scream from the Earl’s room. When we rushed over, the Seventh Princess had already killed Madam Song. Princess Lina’s fingerprints are still on this dagger.”

After explaining all of this, the guard stood behind Mark again, his face expressionless.

Mark raised his eyebrows in a good mood. He looked at the dagger and then at Lina. “At that time, there were witnesses and evidence. The Seventh Princess killed someone. According to the country’s law, the Seventh Princess should be sentenced to death!”𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m
