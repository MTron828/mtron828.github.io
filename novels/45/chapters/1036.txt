1037 You’re actually afraid?

Qiao Nian looked at Qiao Xin’s retreating back and smiled coldly.

“You’re actually afraid?” In her high heels, Qiao Nian caught up to Qiao Xin and asked, “What’s there to be afraid of? This was all your idea back then.”

Qiao Xin didn’t dare to stay any longer. She quickened her pace.

Just as Qiao Xin was about to take a step forward, Qiao Nian grabbed Qiao Xin by the collar and pulled hard, throwing her back into the room.

!!

Qiao Xin fell to the ground in a sorry state. It was so painful that tears streamed down her face. She looked at Qiao Nian with teary eyes.

The coldness in Qiao Nian’s eyes stung.

“Sister, Sister!” Qiao Xin no longer cared about her dignity. Crying, she crawled to Qiao Nian’s leg and hugged it as she begged pitifully. “I really know my mistake. Sister, please let me off this once. I won’t do anything to you again. Sister, please give me a chance to turn over a new leaf!”

Repent?

When Qiao Nian heard these words, she felt a little annoyed. She hated people who made mistakes and begged for forgiveness.

Qiao Xin didn’t know her mistake at all. Qiao Xin was just afraid of being hurt.

If the two of them were on equal footing now, Qiao Nian believed that Qiao Xin would never show any mercy to her.

Qiao Nian kicked Qiao Xin away and said, “After you’ve experienced it, apologize to me and beg for mercy. I think I’ll consider letting you off!”

What?

Qiao Xin was stunned.

Qiao Nian had set her up and even wanted her to apologize and beg for mercy.

Was Qiao Nian still human? Did she still have any sympathy?

Qiao Xin clenched her fists tightly. She had already begged Qiao Nian like this, but Qiao Nian still wouldn’t let her off. It seemed that there was no need to beg Qiao Nian anymore. In a rage, she scolded, “Qiao Nian, you’re a f*cking beast. You’ll die a horrible death for the rest of your life. You’re just a whore, yet you’re pretending to be innocent. Someone like you will be dirty in hell. I swear that if you dare to touch me today, I’ll definitely make you die a horrible death. I’ll return it to you ten times or a hundred times over!”

Qiao Nian looked down at Qiao Xin, who was about to break down. She smiled coldly and said, “You better suffer the consequences of your own actions!”

After a pause, Qiao Nian said, “You want to scheme against me? Alright, I’ll wait slowly!”

With that, Qiao Nian walked out.

Qiao Xin looked at Qiao Nian’s retreating back. Previously, she had already spent a lot of money to get He Cheng to get someone to ruin Qiao Nian’s innocence.

Now that everything was ready, there was only one thing left. As long as He Cheng caught Qiao Nian, Qiao Nian’s reputation would be ruined and she would never be able to reincarnate!

But now, she had to think of a way to get out!

Qiao Nian walked out of the room and closed the door.

Back then, she had been locked in that room. She had wanted to escape, but the door had been locked.

What happened next was unexpected. Her life was almost ruined by that night.

Ever since then, there had been a huge trauma in her heart. Later on, with Qin Chuan’s help, she slowly recovered.

Even now, she still felt uncomfortable whenever she thought of what had happened that night.

Qiao Nian stood in the corridor, her eyes darkening. Suddenly, she felt a burning gaze on her. Suppressing the discomfort in her heart, she looked up.

The moment their eyes met.

She saw the gentleness and love in Gu Zhou’s eyes.

The darkness in Qiao Nian’s heart seemed to be illuminated by the sun. Her lips curved up slightly.

Fortunately.

Back then, she had met Gu Zhou!

Gu Zhou’s deep eyes were filled with laughter. He walked towards Qiao Nian and reached out to her.

Qiao Nian looked down at Gu Zhou’s hand and placed it in his palm.

He gripped her hand tightly, as if to tell her that no matter what happened, he would always be by her side.

Qiao Nian’s smile grew wider and wider. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

At this moment, Lu Zhu came out of He Cheng’s room. When he saw Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou holding hands, he couldn’t bear to watch.

After Lu Jiang came out of He Cheng’s room, he looked at everyone and said, “Alright, let’s go now. Everything has been arranged.”

Everyone walked out.
