Chapter 471: Hemolysis

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The anesthesiologist standing at the side was already prepared. Now, he just had to wait for the blood type report.

The emergency room door opened and a nurse hurried in with the blood type report. She handed it directly to the chief surgeon.

The lead surgeon glanced at the report and frowned. “Type A blood?”

When the nurses standing around heard this, their expressions changed drastically.

Qiao Nian sensed that the atmosphere was a little off. She asked worriedly, “Type A blood? Is there a problem?”

The chief surgeon said, “Miss Qiao, here’s the thing. There was a pregnant woman who bled profusely during the day. She also has type A blood, but in the end, there was only 1,500 milliliters left. I’m afraid it’s not enough for this gentleman.”

Qiao Nian frowned, her eyelids twitching wildly.

The doctor looked at Lu Zhu and sighed. “He’s losing as much as 30% of his blood now. In theory, we should prepare at least 3,000 milliliters of blood.”

The doctor pursed his lips and said, “But it will take at least half an hour to transport it from other hospitals now.”

Qiao Nian understood and interrupted the doctor without hesitation. “I also have Type A blood. Just use mine! Besides, I just had a physical examination a while ago. There’s no problem.”

As Qiao Nian spoke, one of the nurses had already hung up the blood bag and was helping Lu Zhu with the transfusion.

All that was left was to operate and remove the bullets.

The doctor looked at Qiao Nian and frowned. “Even if you donate blood, you can only donate 400 milliliters. That won’t be enough!”

Qiao Nian smiled and said, “That’s a healthy blood donation limit. The situation is urgent now, and he might lose his life if he has ischemia. If I have ischemia, I’ll be unconscious for a while at most. It’s nothing serious!”

The doctor frowned and glanced at Lu Zhu, who was lying on the bed and gradually losing his vitality. After thinking for a moment, he agreed with Qiao Nian’s suggestion. “Let’s cross-match Dr. Qiao’s blood with Mr. Lu’s blood first. If there’s no problem, we’ll draw blood!”

“Okay.” As the nurse spoke, she began to take Qiao Nian’s blood from her veins and cross-matched it with Lu Zhu’s.

Qiao Nian glanced at the other nurse and said, “Go outside and tell Gu Zhou that there’s not enough Type A blood. Tell him to find someone with Type A and Type O blood.”

Qiao Nian knew that Gu Zhou would understand.

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, the nurse nodded and quickly left.

At this moment, the anesthesiologist was also preparing to administer anesthesia. The chief surgeon also began to put on gloves and disinfect himself.

“How—how is this possible?” the nurse exclaimed.

Qiao Nian looked at the nurse in confusion. The chief surgeon had also walked over.

“What happened?” the lead surgeon asked.

The nurse’s expression changed slightly. Finally, her gaze landed on Qiao Nian’s face. “Doctor Qiao, she can’t donate blood for Mr. Lu!”

Qiao Nian frowned slightly and asked in confusion, “How is that possible? We have the same blood type. How can I not donate blood?”

“It’s like this, Doctor Qiao. When your blood came into contact with Mr. Lu’s blood, there was hemolysis!”

Qiao Nian’s beautiful fox-like eyes couldn’t help but widen, her pupils dilating. “How is that possible? How could there be hemolysis?”

The nurse hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to be so shocked. She hurriedly said, “Come and take a look!”

Qiao Nian felt her mind go blank as she walked towards the nurse.

Cross-matching blood was a step that needed to be done before each blood transfusion. To put it simply, the red blood cells of two people were placed together for an agglutination test.

To put it simply, even if they had the same blood type, it was still possible for them to undergo coagulation and hemolysis.

In order to ensure the health of the person receiving the blood, they would check every time there was a blood transfusion.

How could this have happened?

Seeing Qiao Nian standing there in a daze, the nurse called out carefully, “Doctor Qiao?”

Only then did Qiao Nian come back to her senses. She tried her best to calm herself down and said, “Let me take a look.”

The nurse nodded gently and moved aside.Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com
