Chapter 1743 - 1743 Fight

Qiao Nian wanted to matchmake Chen Qing and Lina.

Chen Qing’s gaze fell on the medicine bottle in Qiao Nian’s hand, and a complicated look flashed in his eyes. Then, he looked to the side and said softly, “Young Madam, you should hand this medicine to the servants and let them apply the medicine for the Seventh Princess!”

Qiao Nian looked at Chen Qing in confusion.

When they were at Mark’s Manor just now, she could tell that Chen Qing was very nervous about Lina. Lina was also very nervous about Chen Qing. The two of them looked at each other with love. She thought that their relationship would improve. Why were they starting to fall out again?

If it weren’t for the urgency of the situation and the fact that there were more important things to discuss, she would have asked him clearly.

In the end, Qiao Nian handed the medicine bottle to Via and asked her to apply medicine for Lina again.

When they arrived at the living room of the villa, Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian were sitting together. The president and Lina were sitting opposite them, and Via was sitting beside Lina, helping her to apply medicine.

Chen Qing sat at the corner of the sofa beside Gu Zhou. Opposite him was Via. He lowered his head slightly. He had already taken off his shirt. A servant was applying medicine for him.

Lina glanced at Chen Qing carefully. When she saw the bruises on Chen Qing’s body, her eyes were filled with heartache.

Actually, these abrasions were caused by Chen Qing rubbing against the wall when he was dodging the bullets in the alley. The injuries were shocking.

Qiao Nian noticed Lina’s gaze and looked at Chen Qing beside her. She pursed her lips slightly. She didn’t know when the two of them would be able to break through their barrier and be together for real.

A servant left after serving tea. The president looked up at Qiao Nian and asked, “You didn’t want me to bring Lina home just now. Why? You also know that Mark’s manor is very dangerous. She doesn’t have the ability to protect herself there at all.”

Sensing the pressure from her father, Lina hurriedly smiled and said, “Dad, we’re not negotiating now. Relax, we’re just chatting casually. Nian Nian must have her reasons for suggesting that. I think she must be doing it for our own good!”

When Qiao Nian heard Lina’s words, she smiled at her. Lina was really her good friend. No matter what, she would believe her unconditionally.

A kind and adorable girl like Lina should have a better future.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on the president’s face, and her expression turned serious. With a serious expression, she said, “Last night, Ah Zhou and I had already gone to MY. Over there, we received accurate information that Cui Huai was one of Mark’s men. Mark used Cui Huai to amass wealth. Yesterday, Mark called Cui Huai…”

Qiao Nian told the president about Cui Huai and Mark’s reactions and plans.

When she finished speaking, her throat was a little dry. Just as she was about to get up, Gu Zhou thoughtfully handed her a cup of water.

Qiao Nian held her cup of water and drank it. Gu Zhou continued, “Mark has lost the gold rooms. He’s in a state of anger. In this state, it’s very likely that he’ll lose his mind.”

“Cui Huai has been in MY for so many years. He wants to return to Europe wholeheartedly. Therefore, as long as our people do a little work there, Cui Huai will return uncontrollably. Mark is still angry. If we exert more pressure on Mark, perhaps Mark will be driven to desperation and rebel. At that time, we can get something on Mark, and we can capture Mark and those people in one fell swoop.”Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou were very careful not to reveal their eldest brother’s identity.

When the President heard Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou’s words, he fell into deep thought, his expression relaxing.
