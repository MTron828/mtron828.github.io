1225 Surveillance

If his brother’s call wasn’t being monitored, he would probably call him back on his phone and tactfully acknowledge him.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in front of her. Seeing Gu Zhou nod, she replied readily, “He should be free this weekend!”

“When the time comes, I’ll send the time and place.”

“Okay.”

After Qiao Nian hung up, she heaved a sigh of relief. Her eyelids were twitching crazily, and she felt a little depressed. She had a bad feeling.

She looked up at Gu Zhou, who was sitting at the side. Gu Zhou looked very calm now.

Gu Zhou thought that this time, he might be able to take this opportunity to reunite with his brother after discussing business with him.

However, Big Brother was talking about collaboration this time. It seemed that Big Brother was really being monitored. Perhaps the other party wanted to use this meeting to test him.

At night.

Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou sat on the sofa, watching a movie. Qiao Nian gently swirled the wine in the wine glass.

“Beep—”

On the coffee table, Qiao Nian’s phone suddenly rang sharply. Gu Zhou took the opportunity to pause the movie and asked in confusion, “What happened?”

Qiao Nian put down the wine glass and took her cell phone from the coffee table. A string of red codes appeared on the black phone screen. It was obvious that it had been hacked.

Qiao Nian was about to chase the hacker out when she saw the codes. She was slightly stunned and exclaimed in disbelief, “Eldest Senior Brother!”

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian’s phone. There were many codes on her phone. He looked at Qiao Nian in confusion.

“You mean Chang Feng?” Gu Zhou asked in surprise.

The two of them had talked about Chang Feng before. Only then did he know that Chang Feng was Qiao Nian’s Eldest Senior Brother. It was Chang Feng who had asked her to help him recuperate.

In the past, Chang Feng had been Big Brother’s bodyguard in the Gu family. Back then, not only had Big Brother disappeared, but Chang Feng had also disappeared.

Could it be that Big Brother had asked Chang Feng to look for Nian’er?

Qiao Nian immediately translated the codes and said, “Junior Sister, meet at the Golden Bank alone at 2pm tomorrow afternoon.”

After so many years, she had finally contacted Eldest Senior Brother.

She had always missed Eldest Senior Brother, but he seemed to have disappeared into thin air.

Qiao Nian turned to look at Gu Zhou and said seriously, “Eldest Senior Brother must have something very serious to tell me to meet me at this time.”

At this point, she paused for a moment and continued, “I suspect he wants to say something about your brother.”

“Are you going yourself?” Gu Zhou asked worriedly, frowning. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

This was MY, not An City that was safer. They were at a disadvantage in MY.

If Qiao Nian went out alone and someone attacked her, what should she do?

“Yes.” Qiao Nian nodded seriously and said, “Eldest Senior Brother asked me to go alone. I’ll definitely go myself. Moreover, there should be many people watching you in MY. It won’t be convenient for you to go.”

“But how can you be sure that the person you’re chatting with is your Eldest Senior Brother and not someone else in disguise?” Gu Zhou was still worried about Qiao Nian going out alone.

“Every hacker has a code that represents their identity. Moreover, we will build a very powerful firewall for ourselves. These are all things that others can’t replicate. You have to know that there are many codes. If you change any of them, you might be exposed.” Qiao Nian paused for a moment and continued, “My firewall left a door for Eldest Senior Brother, and Eldest Senior Brother’s firewall also left a door for me. It will be much easier for us to invade each other.”

“I’m K7, so everyone outside calls me Mr. K. My Eldest Senior Brother’s code is L7, so I’m sure the other party is Eldest Senior Brother.” The more Qiao Nian spoke, the brighter her eyes became. She was also excited. “Believe me, it must be my Eldest Senior Brother!”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, the only thing he was sure of was that the person who had contacted Qiao Nian was indeed Chang Feng. However, they were in MY now. He was still worried about Qiao Nian meeting Chang Feng. “I’ll go with you.”

Qiao Nian naturally understood Gu Zhou’s intentions. She held his hand and shook her head gently.
