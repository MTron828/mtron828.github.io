Qin Chuan’s expression suddenly changed.

The slums of Hai Cheng were a place where one could not even eat their fill. The people who lived here were worried about food every day.

The people here should be busy working and earning money every day. How could they have a limited edition perfume?

If she could really afford such a good perfume, why did she still live in the slums of Hai Cheng?

!!

Those who didn’t know better would definitely not know that the person inside was wearing MK perfume. They would only think that it was an ordinary lily fragrance.

Was he really in the right place?

Qin Chuan compared the address and was completely sure that he hadn’t gone to the wrong place.

It seemed that the woman inside was not simple.

With this thought in mind, Qin Chuan knocked on the door.

At this moment, a wary female voice came from inside. “Who is it?”

Qin Chuan could sense the aura in the woman’s words. He frowned, but he quickly relaxed and asked politely, “May I know if this is Xiao Shi and Miss Song’s house?”

After a while, a woman’s uncertain voice came from inside the room. “Yes, who are you?”

“I was sent to pick Miss Song up by Xiao Shi. My name is Qin Chuan!”

“Mr. Qin, please wait a moment!”

Qin Chuan stood at the door and heard the sound of water being poured.

The woman inside must have poured the water out after taking a shower.

About ten minutes later, Qin Chuan heard footsteps approaching the door.

He was about to speak when he heard a woman’s wary voice from inside. “You said you knew Xiao Shi?”

“Yes, I am Xiao Shi’s friend.”

Song Man, who was standing inside the door, frowned even more. She gripped the lock tightly. “Are… are you friends with her? If Xiao Shi had a friend, she would definitely tell me!”

“I met her in An City. She asked me to pick you up,” Qin Chuan said honestly.

When Song Man heard the words of the person at the door, she frowned slightly. Although there were no loopholes in what the person at the door said, she felt that something was wrong.

“I’m a little tired now. I want to rest!” Song Man did not dare to open the door, only hoping that the person at the door would leave quickly.

Qin Chuan could naturally tell that Song Man was wary of him, so he took out the token Qiao Nian had given him and handed it through the gap in the door. “Miss Song, this was given to me by Xiao Shi. She said that if you saw this, you would believe me!”

Song Man took the button from under the door, and her eyes lit up.

This was her birthday gift to her. Only she and Xiao Shi knew about it. It was impossible for outsiders to know.

Only then did Song Man believe Qin Chuan. She opened the courtyard door.

The moment the courtyard door opened, Qin Chuan smelled a special fragrance.

It was the smell of MK’s perfume.

The light from the street lamps shone on the woman’s face.

Perhaps it was because the woman had just taken a shower, but her entire body was covered in steam. Her fair skin was flushed red, and her oval face was so beautiful that one could not take their eyes off her.

Qin Chuan was stunned for a moment, but he quickly regained his senses.

Although Song Man was good-looking, she was still a little inferior to Qiao Nian.

To be honest, Qin Chuan had never expected such a beautiful woman to exist in such a place.

This woman was fair and beautiful. She did not look like someone who was trying to make a living in a poor district at all.

Instead, she looked like a young lady from a rich family who had come to stay overnight.

At the same time, Song Man was also secretly sizing up Qin Chuan.

The man was about 1.9 meters tall. He was wearing a black suit, and even his shirt was black. He looked very lean.

Moreover, his facial features were well-defined. He was handsome and suave. When he smiled, there was a hint of a ruffian’s aura.

She had been in the slums for a long time and had not seen such a good-looking man in a long time. For a moment, she was stunned.

When she came back to her senses, she lowered her gaze shyly.

Worried that he would make a mistake, Qin Chuan asked, “Excuse me, are you Miss Song Man?”

Song Man pursed her lips and nodded shyly. “Yes, please come in!”

Song Man gave up a seat and waited for Qin Chuan and the two bodyguards to enter before closing the door and following them in.

The courtyard was small, but it was very clean.

When they entered the house, Qin Chuan noticed that Song Man only had one arm.
