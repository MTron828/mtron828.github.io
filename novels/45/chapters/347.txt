Chapter 348: Get Lost

With that, Qiao Shan looked up and noticed that Su Xue was also there.

His gentle eyes instantly turned cold as he glared fiercely at Su Xue.

Su Xue spoke a few more words before taking a step forward. “Hubby…”

“Shut up. We’re already divorced!”

Su Xue was shocked by Qiao Shan’s tone. Her tears fell uncontrollably. “Hubby, I’m really sorry. Don’t be angry. Actually, I’ve been thinking about you for the past month. I couldn’t eat or sleep well. I really know my mistake this time!”

Seeing that Su Xue was still getting closer, Qiao Shan stood up like a porcupine, all the thorns on his body standing on end. He said angrily, “Get lost! Stay away from me!”

Su Xue wanted to step forward, but Qiao Yu stopped her. “Mom, you should leave quickly. Don’t make Dad unhappy!”

Su Xue met her son’s cold eyes and felt a little hurt. In the end, she took a step back. She tilted her head and looked at Qiao Shan, saying, “I’ve already cooked some of your favorite food at home. You can eat more of it. I’ll visit you another day.”

With that, Su Xue left reluctantly.

Looking at Su Xue’s lonely back, Qiao Xin’s tears fell uncontrollably. She had to think of a way to make her parents reconcile. A family should be together.

At the Qiao family villa.

When Qiao Shan saw the hot and fragrant food on the dining table, his throat involuntarily moved. Hunger instantly surged in his heart!

In the past month or so in prison, he had never eaten a full meal. Every day, he thought about eating fish and meat. It would be best if he could have two bottles of white wine.

But now, when Qiao Shan thought about how this table of dishes had all been prepared by Su Xue, this immoral woman, his stomach churned. He grabbed the table and flipped over all the dishes.

Crash—

All the food on the table was poured onto the ground.

Seeing her father like this, Qiao Xin’s eyes instantly turned red.

If Qiao Nian hadn’t caused his father to go to jail, her father wouldn’t have hated his mother so much.

Although this was her mother’s fault, her father was a victim who had been made a cuckold and had gone to jail because he had beaten up an adulterer. Who could stand such injustice?

Therefore, it would probably be even more difficult to reconcile her parents.

Qiao Yu, who was standing at the side, was very calm. There was no emotion in his eyes, because this was all within his expectations. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

After his father vented his anger, Qiao Yu walked up to Qiao Sheng and comforted him. “Dad, let’s go out for dinner. Xinxin and I will hold a banquet to welcome you back!”

Qiao Shan’s gaze fell on Qiao Yu. His son was the most outstanding of them all, and his irritation had subsided significantly. He nodded and said, “Okay!”

Silently, Qiao Xin swallowed her tears and hurriedly followed. She understood that it wasn’t appropriate to mention her mother in front of her father now. She will find another chance in the future!

She could not let this family shatter.

She must have worked hard to build her own home.

Moreover, she couldn’t let Qiao Nian have her way.

On the other hand, Qiao Nian took the document to the appraisal center. When she left, she realized that there was still an hour and a half left until the opening ceremony of the charity banquet.

Qiao Nian sat in the car, staring at her watch.

The traffic was so congested that the car did not move even after half an hour had passed.

This was all her fault. She hadn’t been prepared in advance, and now she was stuck in a traffic jam.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on the driver’s face. “Sir, I’ll get off here!”

With that, Qiao Nian handed the money to the driver and got out of the car. She thought that after leaving this traffic jam, she could take a taxi again.

Ring.

A car whistle sounded.

Qiao Nian looked over and saw a man wearing a helmet sitting in a racing car. Even so, it couldn’t hide his tall figure and cold aura.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on the pair of beautiful phoenix-like eyes under the helmet. Her lips curved up slightly.

So it was Mr. Dong Hua.

Lu Nian glanced at the seat behind him and gestured for Qiao Nian to sit down.

Qiao Nian walked over and stepped onto the motorcycle.
