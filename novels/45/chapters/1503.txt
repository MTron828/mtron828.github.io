1504 Model Worker

Gu Zhou was really just helping her take a shower. He scrubbed her body obediently and had no intention of causing trouble at all.

The warm bath water and the perfect massage made Qiao Nian feel a little sleepy.

Just as Qiao Nian was about to fall asleep, Gu Zhou had already pulled her out of the bathroom.

Qiao Nian slapped her face hard with both hands, trying hard to stay awake. She sat by the bed and let Gu Zhou dry her hair. “Just blow dry my hair. We have to hurry to the palace now.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Gu Zhou turned slightly and planted a kiss on Qiao Nian’s forehead. He said softly, “You’ve been busy for the past three days. You must be exhausted. Rest well now. We’ll go to the palace tomorrow morning.”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she frowned slightly and said worriedly, “But we’ve already promised the President three days…”

“I’ve already told the President.” Gu Zhou gently lifted her hair and blew it. He said softly, “I told him we will go to the palace tomorrow morning.”

“Moreover.” Gu Zhou stopped what he was doing and sat down beside Qiao Nian. He stared unblinkingly into her beautiful and charming fox-like eyes and said domineeringly, “In my eyes, your health is the most important.”

Qiao Nian looked into Gu Zhou’s eyes, as if she could see the sea of stars inside. She smiled and nodded in agreement.

It felt good to be doted on and cared for.

Qiao Nian sat by the bed and let Gu Zhou dry her hair. She had never expected Gu Zhou to be so gentle and considerate.

She slowly lowered her gaze, hiding the joy in her eyes.

After drying her hair, Qiao Nian really couldn’t take it anymore and fell asleep.

For the past few days, because of all kinds of things that had happened since she arrived in Europe, she did not even have six hours of rest every day.

Gu Zhou quietly covered Qiao Nian with the blanket before carefully lying down beside her.

In a daze, Qiao Nian felt the warmth of Gu Zhou’s body. She moved slightly closer and reached out to hug him.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian’s quiet sleeping face and his lips curved up slightly. He reached out and wrapped his arm around her waist.

The next morning, when Qiao Nian woke up, she was still stunned.

She sat up in confusion and looked around. For a moment, she couldn’t react to where she was.

After washing up, Gu Zhou came out of the bathroom and saw Qiao Nian sitting on the bed in a daze.

He walked over to Qiao Nian and was about to kiss her when he saw Qiao Nian lift the blanket, take a windbreaker, put it on, and leave.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian’s retreating back in confusion.

Qiao Nian quickly ran to the medicinal room. When she arrived, she saw that the dark circles under Chen Qing’s eyes were especially obvious. He looked like he was about to collapse.

Qiao Nian walked up to Chen Qing uncomfortably, her eyes filled with guilt. “Have you been here for the entire night?”

Yesterday, she had thought that after going upstairs to look for Gu Zhou, she would take the Falling Autumn Grass to the palace. She did not expect to fall asleep halfway.

When Chen Qing heard Qiao Nian’s words, he stood up straight and asked seriously, “Madam, I’ve been guarding here last night. No one else has approached. Are we going to the palace now?”

Chen Qing was simply a model worker. Even after staying up the entire night, he still did not forget about serious matters.

“Yes, I’ll go in a while.” Qiao Nian looked at Chen Qing. During this period of time, Chen Qing had been busy following them and hadn’t had a good rest. “You’re resting today. You don’t have to come with us.”

With that, Qiao Nian walked into the medicine room.

The Falling Autumn Grass she had cultivated was much larger than yesterday. It looked very healthy. There would definitely be no problem when she arrived at the palace.

Qiao Nian gently touched the flower pot. When she thought of Princess Annie’s arrogant expression yesterday, a trace of confusion flashed in her eyes.

Princess Annie didn’t seem to be someone who could settle things peacefully. It was strange that she hadn’t done anything for the past three days.

Qiao Nian recalled the poison in Madam President’s body and frowned slightly.

Two hours later.

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian arrived at the palace.

The president had been waiting outside the palace to pick them up for a long time. He was burning with anxiety. He only hoped that Qiao Nian could really cultivate the Falling Autumn Grass, and he no longer had to be controlled by his brother.
