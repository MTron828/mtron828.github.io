1158 Heavy Punishment?

Song Yu’s thoughts were very simple. Her mother cared about her sister. As long as she mentioned her sister, her mother might not punish her brothers.

When Su Yan heard Song Yu’s words, her gaze softened a little when she looked at her. She gently patted Song Yu’s hand. “You’re right. We have to hold a welcoming banquet for Sugar first, then hold a celebration party to celebrate you winning the Best Actress Award!”

Although this was the first time she had won the Best Actress Award, compared to her mother finding her sister, her sister’s matter was definitely the most important. She actually didn’t want to tell everyone that she had won the Best Actress Award.

She didn’t care about winning the award, but she was still happy to hear that her mother still had to prepare a celebration party for her.

“Mom, Sister’s matter is the most important. My matter isn’t important,” Song Yu said with a smile. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Su Yan patted Song Yu’s hand and said gently, “It’s all important to Mom, but let’s take it one by one. Alright, go to bed. Look at you. You’ve lost weight again. It’s too bad to be a celebrity!”

“But”

“Alright, go up.” Su Yan interrupted Song Yu, but her tone was as gentle as ever.

When Song Yu heard Su Yan’s words, she pursed her lips and nodded. She walked towards the stairs. After taking two or three steps, she turned back to look at Lu Nian and frowned imperceptibly.

In the past, when their brothers were disobedient, their mother would beat them up especially severely. In the most serious case, Third Brother was beaten up so badly that he couldn’t get out of bed for a month.

In the past, she would help stop her. Now that her mother no longer wanted her to stop her, it meant that her mother was really angry.

Song Yu had no choice but to walk upstairs. She wondered if her brothers would be beaten up badly.

In the living room.

Lu Zhu looked at Su Yan’s cold face and gave a gentle smile. “Mom, now that Sister has returned home, you don’t have to worry about having nightmares anymore!”

When Su Yan heard Lu Zhu’s words, her eyes froze.

She still remembered Sugar’s kidnapping. At that time, she couldn’t rest well every day and could only rely on sleeping pills to survive at night.

She had yet to come back to her senses after seeing the transformation of the three-year-old Sugar into a beautiful Nian’er in her twenties. She took a closer look at her four sons. They had already grown up and were no longer children.

They had also become more and more sensible. Although she was very angry and blamed them for not telling her that Sugar was still alive earlier, they had done that for Sugar’s life.

While she was immersed in the days when Sugar was gone, the children had all grown up and could support this family.

Time passed so quickly. She was old now and couldn’t hit these children anymore.

“Kneel in the ancestral hall for an hour!” With that, Su Yan turned around and walked upstairs.

The four people in the living room watched Su Yan leave, unable to come back to their senses for a long time.

Strange!

Their mother should have beaten them up hard. Why did she punish them by making them kneel in the ancestral hall?

This punishment was like a drizzle. To people like them who often knelt in the ancestral hall, it was not heavy at all.

Lu Zhu recalled his mother’s gaze just now and felt something else.

He had just noticed that his mother had a few strands of white hair on her head. Time had passed. His mother was no longer young.

Lu Zhu pursed his lips and said, “Let’s go to the ancestral hall.”

The four of them walked side by side towards the ancestral hall.

Song Yu had been standing on the balcony on the second floor to relax when she saw Lu Qi and Qiao Nian standing on the balcony in the same nightdress.

Their balcony was only a step away.

“Sister, Xiao Qi.” Song Yu greeted her with a smile.

Qiao Nian smiled at Song Yu and asked, “Do you know how Mom will punish them?”

Song Yu shook her head and said, “I don’t know. I just saw that Mom didn’t look well.”
