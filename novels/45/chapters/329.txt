Chapter 330: Appearance

Qiao Nian was like a piece of natural unpolished jade. She was already so beautiful that one couldn’t take their eyes off her.

She looked back at Lu Nian.

Lu Nian met Qiao Nian’s gaze, his eyes sparkling with laughter. He opened his mouth slightly and said silently, “Not bad!”

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but smile. At this moment, the sweetness of the girl next door instantly shattered everyone’s hearts.

At this moment, Qiao Nian felt a burning gaze fall on her. She followed the gaze and saw Gu Zhou sitting in the VIP area.

No one knew what Gu Zhou was thinking. His phoenix-like eyes narrowed slightly, his expression complicated.

However, Qiao Nian knew in her heart that that gaze wasn’t directed at Gu Zhou. In the next moment, she saw Lu Zhu, who was sitting next to Gu Zhou.

That gaze did not belong to Lu Zhu either.

Sitting next to Lu Zhu was a glamorous woman. That woman was none other than Song Yu.

Song Yu was wearing a black fishtail dress today, giving off an exquisite and elegant aura. She was very eye-catching in the crowd.

Qiao Nian narrowed her eyes. She was a little confused. She felt that the gaze just now should have come from Song Yu’s direction.

Lu Qi was smiling as she spoke to Song Yu. Her eyes were filled with a bright smile, making one feel warm.

Moreover, Qiao Nian could sense that Lu Qi was praising Song Yu. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Song Yu smiled and pinched Lu Qi’s nose dotingly.

Lu Qi seemed to sense Qiao Nian’s gaze. She looked up at Qiao Nian, and the smile on her face grew brighter. The dimples on her cheeks were extremely adorable.

Seeing this, Qiao Nian’s lips curved up slightly.

To be honest, Qiao Nian really liked Lu Qi.

Qiao Nian turned around and walked backstage. The next piece would be a piano solo, so she didn’t need to be on stage.

Qiao Nian had just stepped out of the stage when Brother Cao, who was standing at the side, was so excited that tears welled up in his eyes. He leaned over and grabbed Qiao Nian’s hand, asking her from the bottom of his heart. “Nian Nian, do you want to be my artiste? I promise you that in less than half a year, you will definitely be a popular musician.”

Qiao Nian wanted to retract her hand, but Brother Cao was holding on too tightly. Her wrist was hurting a little.

Qiao Nian frowned slightly.

Seeing this, Brother Cao thought that Qiao Nian was unwilling. He hurriedly smiled and explained, “Nian Nian, you have to believe me. I have the strength, and you have the potential. If we work together, that’ll be called a strong team!”

Qiao Nian tried to retract her hand.

Brother Cao thought that Qiao Nian despised him. He felt as if his heart had been hurt. He said, “Nian Nian, do you think half a year is too long? Why don’t I promise you three months? Don’t worry, I’ll definitely let you hold a concert that belongs solely to you.”

The staff member standing at the side was shocked. He looked at Brother Cao in disbelief. This was the first time Brother Cao had cared so much about an artiste.

Qiao Nian sighed slightly and said, “Brother Cao.”

“Yes, go ahead.” Brother Cao smiled at Qiao Nian, as if he would agree to whatever request Qiao Nian made next.

“If you hold my hand again, you might not be able to go on stage anymore,” Qiao Nian said calmly.

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Brother Cao finally realized how reckless he had been. He hurriedly let go, only to see a sudden flush of red on Qiao Nian’s fair wrist. He immediately regretted his actions.

“Oh, it’s my fault. Poor thing. Does it still hurt?”

“It doesn’t hurt anymore!”

Qiao Nian really couldn’t stand the passionate Brother Cao. She suddenly admired Mr. Dong Hua greatly.

“Nian Nian, are you willing to be my artiste?”

Qiao Nian was a little embarrassed to refuse directly, so she could only say tactfully, “I haven’t thought about it.”

When Brother Cao heard Qiao Nian’s words, he understood. He smiled and said, “Alright, alright. Contact me after you’ve thought it through!”
