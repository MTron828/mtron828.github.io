Chapter 1654 Sad

Chen Qing looked at Lina and panicked. His mind was in a mess, and he didn't know what to say for a moment. He took a step forward and raised his hand to help Lina wipe her tears. His voice trembled slightly. "Seventh Princess…"

Lina looked up at Chen Qing.

Seventh Princess.

Even now, she was still the seventh princess of the European country in his eyes.

She raised her hand and shook off Chen Qing's hand. A tear inadvertently fell on the back of Chen Qing's hand. Chen Qing felt that the tear was like boiling lava that would corrode his hand and his entire body.

"I've already said it." Lina took another step back. Even though there were tears on her face, she still suppressed them. "Please stay away from me in the future, Mr. Chen. Otherwise, my fiancé will be angry."

"Also, I'll misunderstand what you mean. Mr. Chen, we're both adults. Please don't give each other the wrong impression."

Chen Qing was flustered. He clenched his fists, his eyes filled with love. He explained anxiously, "It's not what you think. I…"

"Enough." Lina didn't dare to look at Chen Qing's face anymore. She closed her eyes and tried hard to calm herself down. She said seriously, "Mr. Chen, it's not appropriate for the two of us to be here now. I'm going to marry Wright, and you'll have a wife that belongs to you. I hope this ends between us."

With that, Lina turned around and ran towards her room, tears falling one by one. She knew that if she stayed any longer, she would definitely not be able to help but hug Chen Qing.

If she hadn't met Chen Qing, she would only have been sad to marry Wright because she had married a beast.

But she had met Chen Qing. Even if Chen Qing didn't like her, she still loved him. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

She clearly loved Chen Qing, but she had no choice but to marry Wright. This pain was almost unbearable.

Everyone in the world knew that she was the seventh princess of Europe, the daughter doted on by the president. However, everyone knew that as a princess of the royal family, she could not marry the person she loved like an ordinary person.

Why did she have to meet Chen Qing at this time and endure such a painful life?

Chen Qing felt as if he had been nailed to the ground by countless nails. He wanted to chase after her and tell Lina something.

Tell her what…

Chen Qing was a little confused. There seemed to be something shouting in his heart, but he couldn't hear anything clearly.

…

Lina kept running for a long time. In the next moment, she bumped into someone's chest.

Bam!

Lina covered her head and sniffled. She looked at the person with teary eyes. When she saw who it was, she was slightly stunned. She had never expected it to be Gu Zhou.

Just as Lina was about to speak, her hand was grabbed. She looked up and saw Qiao Nian standing in front of her.

"Lina, did I hurt you? I'm sorry." As Qiao Nian spoke, she looked at Lina apologetically. "Seriously, don't you know how to be careful when you walk? You even bumped into Lina. Look, she's in so much pain that she's crying."

Gu Zhou's gaze fell on Lina's face. Seeing Lina's aggrieved expression, he recalled how Lina had run over just now. He thought to himself that the chances of him knocking Lina down and making her cry were not high.

Lina covered her head and took a while to react. She quickly said, "I'm the one who should be sorry. I accidentally bumped into Mr. Gu. Nian Nian, he didn't bump into me."

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She looked at Lina's face carefully. She seemed to have been crying for a long time. Thinking of what Gu Zhou had just said at the Western restaurant, she reached out and took Lina's arm. She asked softly, "Is it because of… Chen Qing?"

Hearing the words "Chen Qing", Lina's heart was in a mess. Tears streamed down her face, and she couldn't control the sadness in her heart at all.

Qiao Nian put her arm around Lina and walked towards her room. She gently patted Lina's shoulder and said gently, "Hey, it's fine. It's fine. Don't cry. This isn't your fault. It's all Chen Qing's fault. Besides, Chen Qing isn't worthy of you!"

Lina bit her lip, tears falling like rain.

Seeing this, Gu Zhou could only leave alone.

Previously, when he returned to the palace with Qiao Nian after dinner, he had wanted Qiao Nian to enlighten Lina.

After all, Lina had indeed suffered a lot.
