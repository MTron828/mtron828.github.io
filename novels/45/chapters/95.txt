Chapter 96: Everything Is Fine Now

Seeing how bold Qiao Nian was, Doctor Su broke out in a cold sweat.

In his eyes, Qiao Nian’s actions were tantamount to suicide.

Qiao Nian took out a silver needle and continued to purge the poison in Matriarch Gu’s body. When she was done, she stood up and began to walk out of the room.

Seeing this, the butler thought that Qiao Nian was trying to escape the situation. Just as he was about to chase after her, Gu Zhou shot him a look, and the butler quailed.

Two minutes later, much to everyone’s astonishment, Qiao Nian ran back into the room, holding a white porcelain bottle.

Her forehead was covered in sweat, perhaps because she had been running too fast.

Qiao Nian didn’t even have time to wipe her sweat away. With a solemn expression, she helped Matriarch Gu up again. After feeding Matriarch Gu the medicine, she glanced at her watch and removed the silver needles from Matriarch Gu’s body.

After she was done, Qiao Nian bandaged the wound on Matriarch Gu’s wrist and helped her lie back down.

Everyone’s attention was wholly on Matriarch Gu. Only after seeing her chest rise and fall did they all heave a sigh of relief. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Jiang Yue stood at the side with her head slightly lowered. No one could tell what she was feeling.

“Ah!” The butler screamed.

Everyone turned to frown at the butler. They all felt displeased with his behavior; he was acting overly flustered.

A trace of joyous surprise flashed across the butler’s face. He said loudly, “Why are you looking at me? Look at Matriarch Gu instead. Her fingers moved!”

His words instantly attracted everyone’s attention, and they all turned to look at Matriarch Gu’s hands.

When Gu Zhou saw Matriarch Gu’s fingers move, delight flashed in his eyes. For a moment, the world of darkness that had shrouded the onlookers seemed to be filled with light.

Doctor Su looked at Matriarch Gu’s fingers in disbelief.

H-how was this possible

Did Qiao Nian really save Matriarch Gu?

suppressing the joy he felt, Gu Zhou lowered his gaze before glancing at Qiao Nian, who was sitting next to him. His expression was complicated.

Qiao Nian placed her hand on Matriarch Gu’s forehead. After a beat, she retracted it.

Matriarch Gu was no longer running a fever, and her condition had already stabilized.

Qiao Nian’s heart, which had been in her throat, finally settled back down. She looked up at Gu Zhou and met his dark eyes. His eyes were as calm as the surface of a lake, almost as if he didn’t care if Matriarch Gu lived or died.

“Grandma’s fever has already subsided and her life is no longer in danger. However, her body is still very weak right now and she can’t move around. She can only recuperate in bed. After this, I’ll prescribe some medicine for Grandma to recuperate,” Qiao Nian said calmly. Her gaze inadvertently fell on Gu

Zhou’s hands, and she saw Gu Zhou’s clenched fists slowly loosen.

So he was still very worried about Matriarch Gu.

Jiang Yue, who had been standing at the side, widened her eyes in disbelief. “Grandma… Is she really okay?”

How was this possible?

Apart from feeding her some medicine, Qiao Nian had only inserted a few needles into Grandma. She had also let quite a lot of Grandma’s blood. Was that really all it took to save Grandma?

Not only that, but this also meant that Qiao Nian was no longer a suspect.

Qiao Nian gave Jiang Yue a meaningful look, then her gaze fell on Doctor Su’s face. She said, “Doctor Su, you can come over to examine Matriarch Gu again.”

Doctor Su had been waiting for Qiao Nian to say this for a long time. He had never expected Qiao Nian to rescue Matriarch Gu in just two or three moves.

He stepped forward quickly and began to examine Matriarch Gu. His hand first fell on Matriarch Gu’s wrist.

A person’s pulse was the best indicator of their health condition.

Strange. How strange.

Although Matriarch Gu’s pulse was weak, it had calmed down significantly.

Matriarch Gu was not running a fever now, and her complexion was gradually getting better. She was truly out of danger.

Doctor Su looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief, forgetting to even breathe… After a long while, he finally asked stammeringly, “Which hospital are you from? Why haven’t I heard of you before?”
