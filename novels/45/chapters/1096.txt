1097 I Like Hearing It

Qiao Nian subconsciously moved back, but Gu Zhou wrapped his arms around her waist, preventing her from moving.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips slightly. Actually, it had been easy for her to call Gu Zhou “Hubby” just now. Now that Gu Zhou was forcing her to call him that, she felt a little uncomfortable.

“I like hearing you call me that!”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, her heart skipped a beat. Her beautiful fox-like eyes stared unblinkingly at Gu Zhou.

!!

After so many years, she and Gu Zhou had finally gotten together. All these years, Gu Chuan had been looking for her.

Gu Chuan was Gu Zhou’s second personality. Ever since he saved her when she was six years old, he had never forgotten her.

Qiao Nian’s red lips curved up slightly, and her eyes curved into crescents. She called out sweetly, “Hubby!”

Gu Zhou’s pupils instantly dilated, and his heart began to race. Joy instantly surged in his heart, and his lips curved up involuntarily. His breathing became a little erratic. He looked at Qiao Nian affectionately, unable to believe what he was hearing.

“You… you… call me that again?” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Gu Zhou seemed to be able to hear his intense heartbeat. He was worried that he was hallucinating.

This was the first time she had opened up to him, so Qiao Nian became more natural. Smiling sweetly, she moved closer to Gu Zhou’s ear and called out softly, “Hubby!”

Gu Zhou’s body stiffened. Time seemed to have stopped. His mind was filled with Qiao Nian’s hot breath by his ear and her sweet voice.

Gu Zhou swallowed, his sexy Adam’s apple bobbing. He looked at the smiling Qiao Nian in front of him and said, “Little fox!”

With that, he pulled Qiao Nian into his arms and lowered his head and kissed her lips. His lips gently caressed hers.

Qiao Nian felt as if a feather had gently brushed across her lips. That numbing feeling instantly spread throughout her body, and her body involuntarily softened.

Gu Zhou let go of Qiao Nian slightly and looked down at her. Their lips were inches apart. As long as either of them moved forward slightly, they would be able to touch each other.

Gu Zhou looked into Qiao Nian’s misty eyes. His heart skipped a beat, and he said in a sexy voice, “You’re so obedient today, honey.”

Qiao Nian was still in a daze from the kiss. Before she could react, the doorbell rang again.

Ding-Dong!

Ding-Dong!

Ding-Dong!

The doorbell rang at the top of its lungs, dispelling the ambiguous atmosphere between Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian!

At this moment, Qiao Nian was still hugging Gu Zhou’s waist with both hands. She slowly retracted her hands and frowned impatiently. “Who is it this time?”

She just wanted some privacy with Gu Zhou. Why were there so many people looking for them?

“I’ll go take a look.” As Gu Zhou spoke, he let go of Qiao Nian and stood up to walk towards the courtyard door.

The blush on Qiao Nian’s face gradually dissipated, and her excited heart gradually calmed down. She walked to the living room door. She wanted to see which blind fool had disturbed her!

Gu Zhou opened the courtyard door. An unfamiliar woman in her early twenties stood at the door.

The woman looked very unfamiliar. She shouldn’t be very old. She was dressed especially old-fashioned. She was wearing a white fur top and black leggings. She exuded a rustic aura.

The woman’s mouth was agape in surprise. She looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief, her saliva flowing down the corner of her mouth.

Oh my god, how could there be such a handsome man in this world?

That man was much more handsome and had an aura superior to those male celebrities!

What made her jealous was that this man was actually Qiao Nian’s husband. She must have burned incense for several lifetimes to marry such a man.

She stood rooted to the ground in a daze, momentarily forgetting why she had come.

Such a handsome man was rare. She had to take a few more glances!

Gu Zhou noticed the strange woman’s gaze. He hated it when others looked at him like that. With a look of disdain, he reached out to close the door.

Seeing Gu Zhou’s actions, the woman took a step forward and hurriedly held the door, opening it again.

The woman inadvertently touched Gu Zhou’s hand.

The woman had not expected her to touch Gu Zhou’s hand either. Her eyes lit up as she stared at Gu Zhou’s hand. This man’s hand was also especially beautiful. His fingers were long and well-defined.
