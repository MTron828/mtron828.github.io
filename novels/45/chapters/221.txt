Chapter 222: Insulted?

It was only later that Qiao Nian discovered that Wang Miao might have used Gu Zhou’s name to get in. However, she didn’t understand. Wang Miao had only been here for half a month. Why had she left so quickly?

“Then why was she chased out?” Qiao Nian asked in confusion.

The butler lowered his head and said truthfully, “Wang Miao has insulted you.”

Qiao Nian was surprised. Puzzled, she asked, “Me?”

She didn’t do anything!

“Some time ago, Madam worked hard to make a blessing bag for the daughter of the Lu family. When Wang Miao saw this, she got someone to make a replica of the blessing bag and gave it to Second Young Master. Second Young Master lost his temper right there and then, and fired her shortly after.”

Qiao Nian looked at the butler in disbelief. She had been fired just like that because she had made a replica of her blessing bag?

This punishment seemed a little severe.

Seeing Qiao Nian’s shocked expression, the butler explained patiently, “Second Young Master doesn’t like those who sow discord. She even said that the blessing bag you made was copied from her.”

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze.

The butler continued, “However, everyone believes in Second Young Madam’s character. Second Young Master naturally believes in you as well. He couldn’t tolerate such a woman staying in the Gu family and chased her out.”

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but smile. She said softly, “I really didn’t expect him to be able to identify a two-faced person at a glance.”

The butler smiled and said, “Second Young Madam, you’ll be able to discover Second Young Master’s strengths one by one in due time. He’ll give you some unexpected surprises.”

Qiao Nian smiled faintly and didn’t speak.

She had just discovered Gu Zhou’s adorable personality today, Zhou Zhou.

“Second Young Madam, I’ll get back to work!”

Qiao Nian smiled and nodded. “Go!”

As soon as the butler left, another playful girl came out of Matriarch Gu’s room.

“Second Sister-in-law.” Zhao Qian walked up to Qiao Nian with a bright smile. “Come with me!”

With that, Zhao Qian stepped forward and pulled Qiao Nian towards her room.

Qiao Nian looked down at her hand, which Zhao Qian was holding. Zhao Qian’s hand was especially soft, and emanated a gentle warmth.

Zhao Qian brought Qiao Nian back to her room. She smiled at Qiao Nian and said, “Second Sister-in-law, I know that today is your birthday, so I’ve prepared a special gift for you in advance!”

With a smile on her face, Qiao Nian asked confusedly, “What gift?”

“I promise that if you use this, your relationship with Brother Ah Zhou will improve.” Zhao Qian pointed at the gift box on the table and said excitedly, “Second Sister-in-law, open it quickly!”

When Qiao Nian heard Zhao Qian’s words, she found them very novel. She walked to the table and looked at the unlabeled box. It had no label, but she guessed that it was used to store clothes.

Qiao Nian opened the box. When she saw the clothes inside, her ears turned red uncontrollably.

Inside was a piece of black lingerie.

Zhao Qian lowered her voice. “Second Sister-in-law, this lingerie is made of real silk. It’s definitely comfortable to wear. The lace and black gauze at the edges are also made of real silk. It’s light and soft to the touch!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Qiao Nian stood there, pretending to be calm.

“Don’t worry, this piece covers all the areas that should be covered. The black lace gives off a filmy, dreamy feel. This kind of beauty is the most attractive,” Zhao Qian fired off rapidly.

Although Qiao Nian was used to witnessing spectacles or scenes of chaos, she was still stunned when she saw this.

Qiao Nian came back to her senses and turned to look at Zhao Qian. Just as she was about to speak, she heard Zhao Qian say, “Second Sister-in-law, I secretly made this in Grandma’s office. Apart from you and me, no one else knows!”

Zhao Qian knew that Qiao Nian would be shy. She continued, “Don’t worry, Brother Ah Zhou will be the only other one to know about this in the future. No one else will know about this dress!”

“This… this is a dress?”

“Of course. A lingerie dress is still a dress!” Zhao Qian said righteously.
