1066 Fast Car

After Gu Zhou closed the passenger door, he immediately walked to the driver’s seat and drove away.

Qiao Nian was about to swipe her cell phone when she suddenly felt the car speed up. She turned to look at Gu Zhou and said worriedly, “Don’t drive so fast. Safety first.”

Gu Zhou did not answer. His lips curved up slightly, and he quickly drove to the entrance of the Dongjiang villa.

The two of them got out of the car.

!!

When she stood at the entrance of the Dongjiang villa, Qiao Nian’s heart began to race uncontrollably, as if it would jump out of her chest the next moment.

She knew what was about to happen and felt inexplicably nervous.

When she and Gu Zhou were in Room 1314, they had spent almost the entire night tossing and turning. Later on, when they returned to the Gu residence, they had only done it once, and that was because the two of them were worried that their children would enter the room.

There were only the two of them in the Dongjiang villa. Would he…

Suddenly, a fragrance wafted over.

Qiao Nian came back to her senses and realized that Gu Zhou had already opened the door to the Dongjiang Villa.

The small garden of the villa was filled with roses. When she walked in, it was as if she was wandering in a sea of roses.

Holding Qiao Nian’s hand, Gu Zhou walked in.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou beside her. In a daze, she recalled the first time she had seen him. He had an aversion to women and yearned to be surrounded by men.

But now, Gu Zhou’s aversion to women seemed to be much better. Moreover, he no longer disliked other women so much.

When Qiao Nian followed Gu Zhou into the living room, she was slightly stunned.

Previously, Song Man had lived in the Dongjiang villa, but now, all the decorations in the house had become minimalist. It was simply brand new.

Gu Zhou probably didn’t want to use what Song Man had used.

Qiao Nian stood at the entrance and took off her high heels, preparing to put on cotton slippers.

“Huh?”

The world spun. When she came back to her senses, she realized that Gu Zhou was carrying her like a princess. She blushed slightly and said, “I can walk on my own!”

“Today, we’ll stay here.”

Stay here.

Hearing Gu Zhou’s words, Qiao Nian’s heart beat like a war drum. Her heart was beating rapidly, as if it would jump out of her mouth the next moment.

The two of them had been intimate three times, but she was still not used to being intimate with him.

However, if she pretended to be shy at this moment, it would seem a little pretentious!

Qiao Nian allowed Gu Zhou to carry her to her room on the second floor. After Gu Zhou placed her on the bed, she continued to hug Gu Zhou’s neck tightly, staring unblinkingly at him. Her lips curved up slightly, and she gently kissed Gu Zhou’s Adam’s apple.

Gu Zhou’s body stiffened slightly, but he quickly reacted. Without hesitation, he pressed Qiao Nian under him and lowered his gaze slightly, looking at Qiao Nian in his arms. “You seductive little fox!”

Qiao Nian smiled until her eyes curved into crescents. Just as she was about to speak, Gu Zhou kissed her lips domineeringly. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

His kiss was as domineering as ever, roaming her mouth without restraint.

That numbing feeling spread from her tailbone to every part of her body.

Qiao Nian gradually couldn’t breathe. Her body went limp, and her consciousness gradually faded.

Indeed, she still couldn’t resist Gu Zhou’s temptation.

Moonlight filtered through the window, adding to the ambiguous atmosphere in the room. The temperature in the room rose.

…

At the Lu family’s old residence.

Matriarch Lu kept pulling everyone from the Lu family into the living room to talk. Holding a photo of Qiao Nian when she was young, she smiled and told them about Sugar’s childhood.

“Sugar especially liked to eat cotton candy and corn candy when she was young. Boss, remember to buy more and put them at home!”

“Sugar has always loved beauty when she was young. She went to the mall to choose a dress herself. She’s especially adorable. Second Brother, I remember that you have a fashion shop under your name. Prepare more dresses for your sister later. Sugar has suffered outside all these years. We can’t let her suffer anymore!”

“Third Brother, your sister has suffered in the past. Later on, investigate who bullied her and bully them back. Our eldest daughter of the Lu family can’t suffer grievances!”

“Fourth Brother, your sister is back. Aren’t you going to do anything? Go back and ask around what she likes. Prepare more gifts!”
