965 Miserable

Su Xue was so frightened that she forgot to cry. This was the first time she had heard Qiao Shan complain about his daughter, but that was the daughter she had painstakingly raised. She subconsciously shielded Qiao Xin and defended herself. “We raised Qiao Xin together. She’s our daughter. What happened has already happened. There’s no point in regretting it. We’re her parents. We can’t just watch her spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair…”

Towards the end, Su Xue lowered her head and sobbed softly.

Qiao Shan was slightly stunned. At that time, he had indeed wanted Qiao Xin to choose him. He couldn’t bear to let his child suffer. After all, Qiao Xin was still very young. She still had a long way to go.

He had already retired from the top.

!!

Although he understood that this was the best choice, looking at his missing leg, his heart was filled with sorrow. He had dominated the business world for so many years, but he had actually ended up in such a miserable state.

Qiao Shan raised his hand to touch his tears.

He had worked so hard his entire life, but Qiao Xin had ruined everything.

The Qiao family could clearly reach a higher level!

At this moment, the ward door was pushed open from the outside.

Su Xue looked up immediately. When she saw the person standing at the door, her face instantly turned pale. She looked at the person warily.

Qiao Shan’s heart skipped a beat. He immediately sat up straight and wiped his tears.

For some reason, Qiao Shan had a bad feeling about this.

With one hand in his pocket, Lu Zhu slowly walked in. When he walked in, he looked at Qiao Shan indifferently. His gaze was as cold as ice, without a trace of warmth.

Su Xue felt a sense of oppression. She immediately stood up and shielded Qiao Shan behind her. Trying hard to overcome the fear in her heart, she asked, “Mr. Lu, did you enter the wrong ward?”

Lu Zhu’s gaze landed on Su Xue’s face. His gaze was cold as his thin lips parted slightly. “No, I’m here to look for you!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

His voice was cold, and his entire body emitted a cold aura. The entire ward instantly turned cold.

At this moment, Qiao Shan and Su Xue realized that neither the Lu family nor the Gu family could compare to them.

Su Xue swayed on the spot. She looked around in a panic and asked carefully, “Mr…. Mr. Lu, what can I do for you?”

… .

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou hesitantly.

Seeing that Qiao Nian had calmed down, Gu Zhou said gently, “Come down!”

Qiao Nian instantly became nervous again. She swallowed and looked up at him.

The sunlight shone on Gu Zhou’s face, making him glow white. His body seemed to be covered in a layer of golden light, making him feel much warmer.

The light seemed to shine into Qiao Nian’s heart, driving away the darkness in her heart and bringing light to her.

Strangely enough, their fear of this hotel had lessened significantly.

Gu Zhou reached out his hand, preparing to invite Qiao Nian out of the car like a gentleman.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou’s slender and fair hand. She hesitated for a moment before placing her hand in Gu Zhou’s palm.

Gu Zhou’s lips curved up slightly. He gently gripped Qiao Nian’s hand and looked at her with such gentleness that water could drip from his eyes.

Since she had given her hand to him, he would never let go of her for the rest of his life!

Qiao Nian got out of the car. The uneasiness in her heart had completely disappeared. With Gu Zhou by her side, she didn’t have to worry about anything.

After Gu Zhou closed the car door, he locked it and led Qiao Nian towards the hotel.

He kept holding Qiao Nian’s hand, worried that she would leave because of the fear in her heart.

Walking into the hotel, Qiao Nian turned to look at Gu Zhou and asked, “Are you bringing me here for dinner?”

“You’ll understand in a while.” As Gu Zhou spoke, he led Qiao Nian into the elevator and casually pressed 13.

Thirteenth floor?

Qiao Nian’s body stiffened, and her throat went dry.

That night six years ago was like a nightmare that swept through her again.

Qiao Nian froze and subconsciously looked at Gu Zhou.

Why did Gu Zhou press 13?

If she remembered correctly, the 13th floor was a hotel room floor. There was no dining room at all.

What was Gu Zhou doing?

Was it a coincidence?

Or did he already know everything?
