881 Relief

Qiao Nian could only comfort Xiao Shi silently, because she knew that what Xiao Shi needed the most now was company.

After a while, under Qiao Nian’s comfort, Xiao Shi gradually calmed down. She lowered her head and silently shed tears.

Holding a tissue, Qiao Nian carefully wiped the tears from Xiao Shi’s eyes.

Xiao Shi let Qiao Nian wipe her tears. She seemed to have thought of something and looked up at Qiao Nian.

!!

Her eyes were like those of a deer, extremely clear. Her eyes were filled with tears, making one’s heart ache.

Xiao Shi asked tearfully, “Auntie Nian Nian… Am I sick? Am I especially stupid? I know she doesn’t like me, and I know that I’m a burden to her, but I’ve always felt that she’s my mommy and I’ve always missed her because she’s my mommy to begin with. But what did she say? She’s not my mommy. Auntie Nian Nian, am I too stupid?”

“Xiao Shi, actually, you’re very smart. It’s normal for you to be confused now. When a person gets into a relationship with someone, they can’t rationally withdraw easily. Auntie Nian Nian experienced these things . It took her a long time to understand.”

Although she didn’t know much about Qiao Nian’s words, she heard something important.

“Was Auntie Nian Nian unhappy when she was young?” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Yes, Auntie Nian Nian was sent to the mountains by my family when she was young. At that time, Auntie Nian Nian looked forward to them picking me up all day.”

As Qiao Nian spoke, she didn’t forget to wipe the tears from Xiao Shi’s eyes. She continued, “At that time, Auntie Nian Nian waited every day, but they didn’t come. I only understood all of this later. Each of us should love ourselves first, then love the people who treat us well.”

When Xiao Shi heard Qiao Nian’s words, she said seriously, “Just like how Brother likes me and I like Brother?”

“Yes.” Qiao Nian smiled at Xiao Shi and said gently, “Sometimes, someone you haven’t met for a long time can love you the most. Love can transcend time. For example, Xiao Qi, your daddy, your grandmother, and Auntie Nian Nian fell in love with Xiao Shi the moment they saw her. As long as you feel it with your heart, you can feel our love.”

When she heard Qiao Nian’s words, the entire world seemed to be illuminated. She stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian, so touched that tears fell uncontrollably.

Of course, she knew that someone loved her, but when she thought of Song Man, she was still very sad.

Qiao Nian knew that the pain in her heart couldn’t be eliminated in a short period of time. It needed time to heal.

Although she didn’t like Song Man very much, she still wanted to tell Xiao Shi about her objectively.

“Xiao Shi, actually, Song Man still likes you a lot.” Qiao Nian smiled gently at Xiao Shi and said slowly.

Xiao Shi’s eyes lit up. She looked at Qiao Nian expectantly. She really wanted to hear Qiao Nian continue.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips and continued, “If she really didn’t like you, she wouldn’t have pushed you back at the last moment and given you a chance to survive. I think she just committed suicide by jumping off a building. The reason why she brought you there wasn’t because she wanted you to die with her. She wanted to die and was afraid that we wouldn’t give her a chance.”

Although Qiao Nian said that, she was just comforting Xiao Shi. Her words were half true.

She felt that the truth should be that Song Man wanted to use Xiao Shi as a bargaining chip. Later on, she wanted to commit suicide. She had originally planned to bring Xiao Shi along, but later on, Song Man found her conscience and couldn’t bear to take Xiao Shi away, so she pushed Xiao Shi away.

Song Man should have cared a lot about Xiao Shi, but she had never realized this. Song Man only realized this clearly at the moment before she died.

Qiao Nian looked at the light in Xiao Shi’s eyes and heaved a sigh of relief. She thought that Xiao Shi would think that her childhood was still very bright. At least in Xiao Shi’s opinion, Song Man cared about her.

Xiao Shi was very smart and sensible, but she was still young and was easily affected by the attitude of those close to her.

Just like her.

Just like Gu Qi, who was being taken care of by a vicious nanny.
