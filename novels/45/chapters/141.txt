Chapter 142 Why Did You Say Thank You

Qiao Nian didn’t know what she had said to anger Gu Zhou. She opened the door and got out of the car without hesitation, slamming the door shut without looking back.

The moment she closed the door, the car began to move.

Qiao Nian really hadn’t expected Gu Zhou to abandon her in the wilderness!

Qiao Nian watched as the car drove further and further away, and realized that Gu Zhou was really going to leave her behind. She was speechless. How could this man be happy for one moment, then immediately fly into a rage the next? He changed his moods even faster than a child!

In the car, Chen Qing shrank under the overwhelming pressure. He was trembling.

His hands were covered in cold sweat. As he watched the figure of Qiao Nian grow smaller and smaller, the unease in his heart grew. “Um, Master Gu, Young Madam might be afraid of the dark. Should we turn back and pick her up?” Chen Qing asked tentatively. The cold aura around Gu Zhou intensified. “Are you so eager to invite humiliation?” Chen Qing: “?”

Chen Qing didn’t understand at all. How would his Master Gu be humiliated within his own family?

Moreover, with Madam’s capability, she would definitely find a cab within minutes.

Chen Qing kept quiet, and continued driving. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Turn back.”

Chen Qing’s hands trembled. His intelligence must be a little lacking. He couldn’t understand what Master Gu was trying to say at all.

“Go back!”

Chen Qing: Didn’t he say that he wasn’t going to invite humiliation?

Wasn’t this doing the exact opposite?

Chen Qing did not dare to voice his thoughts, much less ask Master Gu what he was doing.

The sky was already fully dark, and the streetlights emitted a dim light.

Qiao Nian took out her phone. She felt that it might be dangerous for her to remain here any longer. She got ready to call someone to pick her up.

She would definitely settle scores with Gu Zhou when she got back.

Just as she took out her phone, a car suddenly stopped near her.

The car’s headlights were still on, and the lights were so bright that she could barely keep her eyes open.

Instinctively, Qiao Nian raised a hand to shield her eyes.

At this moment, Chen Qing turned off the headlights.

Gu Zhou got out of the car and walked towards Qiao Nian.

With great foresight, Chen Qing had stopped the car about one hundred meters away from Qiao Nian, leaving room and privacy for her and Gu Zhou.

Seeing that Gu Zhou had arrived, a trace of confusion flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes. With a displeased expression, she questioned, “Gu Zhou, what exactly are you doing?”

Qiao Nian’s face was slightly flushed from anger, and the rage in her eyes was clearly visible. She looked like a furious kitten. Her anger was strangely adorable, making one feel the urge to pet her head.

Suppressing his desire to touch Qiao Nian’s head, Gu Zhou’s gaze inadvertently fell on her pouting lips. His eyes darkened by several shades.

When Gu Zhou didn’t reply, Qiao Nian frowned. With displeasure written all over her face, she said, “What exactly are you doing?”

Gu Zhou placed his right hand in his pocket and looked down at Qiao Nian commandingly. “You’re my wife.”

“Yes. We’ve already registered our marriage!” Qiao Nian thought to herself that when she had finished dealing with the rotten Qiao family, and when Gu Zhou had recovered, she would be able to divorce Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou narrowed his phoenix-like eyes, a trace of coldness appearing in them. “Since that’s the case, why did you still thank me?”

Qiao Nian was speechless.

Gu Zhou had chased her off the car in a rage just now because she had thanked him.

Qiao Nian was a little confused. What kind of logic was Gu Zhou following?

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion. “Isn’t thanking you a basic courtesy?”

“I don’t need you to be courteous to me.”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she was a little stunned. She hesitated for a while, then asked, “Did you come back just to tell me this?”

“Come home with me!”

Qiao Nian: Then what exactly was he trying to achieve?

Was he trying to make her stop thanking him?

Gu Zhou’s way of thinking was truly incomprehensible to ordinary people.

Qiao Nian was completely at a loss as to how to deal with Gu Zhou. She pursed her lips. She couldn’t be bothered to ask any more questions.
