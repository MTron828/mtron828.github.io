1125 Losing her integrity

Jiang Chi stood there calmly, looking at Qin Chuan and Lu Qi expressionlessly. He was not frightened by Qin Chuan’s mercenaries at all.

Qin Chuan stood there calmly, put away his pistol, and raised his eyebrows slightly. “It doesn’t matter where I die, but if you die here, who will be responsible for Jiang Cheng’s burial?”

Qin Chuan paused for a moment and continued, “If there’s really necrophilia, Jiang Cheng will really lose his integrity!”

Qin Chuan emphasized his words.

Jiang Chi looked at Qin Chuan expressionlessly and frowned slightly. His younger brother was the best brother in the world, and his younger brother was also the most good-looking person in the world. Indeed, there were perverts who might covet his younger brother’s beauty!

Seeing the hesitation on Jiang Chi’s face, Qin Chuan continued, “I believe that humans have souls, and I believe that there’s a next life. My thoughts are very traditional. If a person isn’t buried for a long time, I’m afraid it will delay his reincarnation!”

Qin Chuan and Jiang Chi had been opponents for five to six years. They both knew each other well. He also knew that Jiang Chi cared about Jiang Cheng the most.

When Jiang Cheng was still alive, Jiang Chi was considered gentle to people. Ever since Jiang Cheng died, Jiang Chi had directly changed his territory’s name to ghost city.

When Jiang Chi heard Qin Chuan’s words, he thought about how he trapped his brother in an ice coffin. His brother had been lying there alone and pitiful. Usually, he was the only one who spoke to Jiang Cheng. When he wasn’t in the Ghost City, Jiang Cheng was alone.

His frown deepened. He had always wanted to fulfill Jiang Cheng’s wish and make him no longer alone. His eyes gradually turned cold. “Give me Lu Qi!”

Qin Chuan’s eyes turned cold. He did not expect Jiang Chi to be so stubborn. He glanced at Lu Qi, who was standing beside him. Lu Qi had her head lowered, as if she was thinking about something. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“With me around, I won’t let you take her away!” Qin Chuan’s thin lips curved up slightly as he stared unblinkingly at Jiang Chi!

When Jiang Chi and Qin Chuan’s eyes met, sparks flew.

Jiang Chi frowned slightly and asked coldly, “I didn’t expect you to be a lover. Is it worth it to lose your life for a woman?”

“It’s worth it!” Qin Chuan said without thinking.

Lu Qi, who was standing beside Qin Chuan, felt her heart skip a beat when she heard his words. She looked up at him.

He seemed to have never seen her before. Did the two of them know each other?

Lu Qi clenched her fists tightly.

Jiang Chi suppressed his anger. Qin Chuan was really shameless. He was unwilling to give in at all. With a fierce expression, he said, “Then all of you can die!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Jiang Chi’s bodyguards immediately aimed their guns at Qin Chuan.

Qin Chuan’s men immediately surrounded Qin Chuan and Lu Qi.

At this moment, his phone rang.

Qin Chuan knew that his cell phone was ringing. He took it out of his pocket. His gaze was fixed on Jiang Chi’s face. He casually picked up the call, but he accidentally touched the speakerphone!

Jiang Chi made a “stop” gesture. He did not expect Qin Chuan to still be in the mood to pick up the phone at a time like this.

At this moment, a pleasant female voice came from the cell phone. Jiang Chi was slightly stunned!

“Old Qin, how are things on your side?”

Jiang Chi narrowed his eyes. It was Qiao Nian calling Qin Chuan.

When Lu Qi heard Qiao Nian’s voice, her eyes lit up. Her eyes couldn’t help but turn red as she called out excitedly, “Sister!”

Holding her phone, Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She glanced at her phone. She had called Qin Chuan. It seemed that Qin Chuan had already found Lu Qi.

She still remembered the situation when Lu Qi was kidnapped by He Cheng. She saved Lu Qi, and Lu Qi cried until she was out of breath.

“Lu Qi, don’t be afraid. I’ll go look for you immediately. Let Old Qin protect you now. Be good and listen to him!”

Holding back her tears, Lu Qi nodded and agreed obediently. “Okay.”

Lu Qi believed everything Qiao Nian said. She felt that her sister was like a god who would protect her and never let her be hurt.

Seeing Lu Qi looking at the cell phone expectantly, Jiang Chi frowned in confusion and murmured, “Sister?”

Qiao Nian and Lu Qi were sisters?

Their surnames were different.
