Chapter 253: Alert

She was a fan of Mr. Dong Hua. She really wanted his autograph. It was her honor to be able to perform on the same stage as Mr. Dong Hua.

Brother Cao paused for a moment before continuing, “Mr. Dong Hua has already said that if you play the violin well, he will meet you. There are only two days left. If you can’t play this score perfectly, we will replace you!”

When Xia Xue heard Brother Cao’s words, she instantly grew nervous. She said solemnly, “Brother Cao, I understand. I will definitely practice hard!”

After hanging up, Xia Xue hugged Gao Lin, who was standing beside her. Tears of joy rolled down her face, and her voice was choked with emotion. “Lin Lin, you’re really my lucky star. I’ve really been chosen. I’m so happy! If you hadn’t come to look for me, I might have missed this opportunity!”

Gao Lin was also overjoyed. From today onwards, she would be able to trample on Qiao Nian and Wang Xuan.

“Sister Xia Xue, you deserve this. I didn’t help you much!” Gao Lin said humbly.

“No, no, no. If it weren’t for you, I might have missed this opportunity.” When Xia Xue thought of how he would be performing on stage with Mr. Dong Hua in two days, she was so excited that she didn’t know what to say.

“Sister Xia Xue, I’ll work hard with you these few days. From now on, you might be the next world-famous musician after Dong Hua!” Gao Lin smiled at Xia Xue and flattered her.

“Okay!” Xia Xue nodded solemnly. She made up her mind to practice hard. She would never waste such a good opportunity.

Xia Xue suddenly recalled something. Previously, Gao Lin had said that another new student had joined their class. That new student could play the song “Snow in Spring” perfectly. That girl was very likely to be a strong opponent for her.

At the thought of this, Xia Xue felt a little uneasy.

“Lin Lin, is the freshman in your class who plays ‘Spring and Snow’ with a zither really very capable?” Xia Xue asked uneasily.

Hearing Xia Xue’s question, a trace of disdain flashed across Gao Lin’s face. She said, “Sister Xia Xue, you’re really too nervous. She’s just a freshman. She learned all her musical instruments at home. She only knows how to play that one tune. She’s nothing in front of you. Don’t worry, she’s not as outstanding as you!”

Xia Xue was still frowning. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Gao Lin knew very well that Xia Xue was worried that she would be replaced. After all, Brother Cao’s last reminder still rang in her ears. She said comfortingly, “She’s just a country bumpkin. She just happened to have Mr. Dong Hua’s tickets!”

When Xia Xue heard Gao Lin’s words, her frown deepened. She was still worried and asked softly, “Lin Lin, can you do me a favor?”

When Gao Lin heard Xia Xue’s words, she nodded without hesitation. “Sister Xia Xue, if you need any help, just tell me. As long as I can help, I’ll definitely do my best.”

Xia Xue heaved a sigh of relief and said, “Don’t let her practice in training room 23.”

Xia Xue knew very well that Gao Lin definitely didn’t like that freshman, but Gao Lin’s standards were very high. Few people could make Gao Lin praise them when they played musical instruments.

It was because of this that Xia Xue was so careful. She couldn’t let anyone steal her hard-won opportunity.

Gao Lin instantly understood Xia Xue’s concerns. She smiled and said, “Sister Xia Xue, don’t worry. I won’t let her train in that training room!”

Deep down, Gao Lin still had to admit that Qiao Nian was very accomplished with the zither.

Even if Xia Xue didn’t remind her about this, she wouldn’t let Qiao Nian steal Xia Xue’s golden rice bowl!

After Xia Xue and Gao Lin parted ways, Gao Lin returned to the classroom.

Qiao Nian and Wang Xuan were chatting about the score when Qiao Nian suddenly felt a chill run down her spine.

Qiao Nian turned her head and saw Gao Lin walking in arrogantly. Gao Lin was still staring at her.

Gao Lin looked like an arrogant princess looking at a prisoner who was about to be sentenced to death.
