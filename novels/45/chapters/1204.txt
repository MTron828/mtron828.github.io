The gift Mr. Chen had given Qiao Nian was too expensive. Everyone had come here to gamble on stones for the glass-type imperial jade.

Thank you readers!

For a stranger to give such an expensive gift to a woman, it would definitely make one’s imagination run wild.

The people around them looked at Mr. Chen in surprise and discussed.

“Mr. Chen spent hundreds of millions of yuan here today. Could it be that he came here to get a glass-type imperial jade to give away?”

“Yes, this is really a big deal!”

“He must be related to the queen of stone gambling.”

“She is Mrs. Gu, the queen of stone gambling. It’s obvious that he’s unrelated to her. If they’re really related, why would he call her Mrs. Gu?”

“Yes, why would Mr. Chen give such an expensive jade to the queen of stone gambling?”

…

Jiang Chi, who was standing on the second floor, frowned coldly. He stared unblinkingly at Mr. Chen on the first floor. From his angle, he could see Mr. Chen’s side profile.

Holding the glass of red wine in his hand, he walked to the left and looked straight at Mr. Chen. When he saw Mr. Chen’s face, the confusion in his eyes became more and more obvious.

It was an unfamiliar face. Although the face was unfamiliar, he looked into Mr. Chen’s eyes. Those eyes felt familiar.

Jiang Chi drank his red wine thoughtfully and said nothing else.

Jiang Yue looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief.

Strange, how could Qiao Nian be related to Mr. Chen?

Even though Boss Jin liked her a lot, she knew very well that Boss Jin wouldn’t go against Mr. Chen and harm Qiao Nian.

A trace of panic flashed in Jiang Yue’s heart as she thought about what to do in the future.

At this moment, everyone’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. They wanted to see what Qiao Nian would choose to do with this gift that was worth hundreds of millions.

In a daze, Qiao Nian recalled that dream. In the dream, Mr. Chen protected her at all costs. He would rather die with those people than let her be hurt.

Qiao Nian was very curious about who Mr. Chen was. Why would he give her such an expensive gift?

If she rejected Mr. Chen at this moment, it would only embarrass him. When the time came, they would be asking Mr. Chen for information. What if he rejected them?

Under everyone’s surprised and puzzled gazes, the stone gambling banquet ended. Lu Jiang smiled and sent everyone off. Then, he walked up to Mr. Chen and said politely, “Mr. Chen, please move to the second floor.”

“Alright, I’m still looking forward to Mrs. Gu’s gift.” As Mr. Chen spoke, he glanced at Qiao Nian, then followed everyone to the second floor.

Gu Zhou frowned slightly at Mr. Chen and pursed his lips, remaining silent. He had just noticed the way Mr. Chen was looking at Qiao Nian. That gaze was especially familiar to him.

Qiao Nian looked at the imperial jade in her hand and didn’t know what to do for a moment. She had met Mr. Chen once in the past, and Mr. Chen had even given her this expensive gift when he knew that she was already married. It was really strange.

Gu Zhou lowered his head slightly and whispered in her ear, “Nian’er, we should go upstairs.”

Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou, smiled, and nodded.

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian walked behind. The people in front had already entered the living room.

Seeing that Gu Zhou was frowning along the way, Qiao Nian thought that he minded the gift Mr. Chen had given her. She said, “I’ll give you a big gift in the future.”

Gu Zhou knew that Qiao Nian had misunderstood him. He said in a low voice, “I just think his gaze is a little familiar, but I can’t remember where I’ve seen him before.”

“Take your time to think about it. There’s no hurry.” Qiao Nian thought of Mr. Chen’s back again. In her dream, she saw Mr. Chen’s back and thought he was Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou and Mr. Chen’s backviews were too similar. Even she couldn’t tell.

Could it be that Gu Zhou and Mr. Chen were family?

This thought flashed across Qiao Nian’s mind. She and Gu Zhou walked into the living room.

When Mr. Chen walked into the living room, he saw that there was already someone in the room. He sat casually on the sofa on the other side.
