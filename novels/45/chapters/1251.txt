1252 Sarcasm

Seeing the anger in Boss Jin’s eyes towards Jiang Yue, a trace of sarcasm flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes.

Men were the most heartless creatures in the world. When a man loved you, it was true love. He yearned to give you everything.

When a man didn’t love you, he would be very ruthless to you, making you beg for death.

However, all of this had nothing to do with her anymore. After Qiao Nian retracted her gaze, she followed Gu Zhou out.

Jiang Yue heard Gu Zhou’s footsteps getting further and further away. She turned her head and saw Gu Zhou’s Qiao Nian walking out side by side.

At this moment, Jiang Yue realized what was going on. She turned her head to look at Boss Jin inch by inch, her eyes filled with fear.

When Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian walked into the courtyard, Jiang Yue’s screams of pain came from the living room.

Qiao Nian believed that this wasn’t Jiang Yue’s only pain.

Jiang Yue’s screams continued. Qiao Nian didn’t pity Jiang Yue at all. After all, how could a person pity a beast?

When Gu Zhou walked out of the courtyard, he glanced around. The villa was quiet, as if there was no one else around.

The chirping of birds could be heard from the side. Gu Zhou didn’t find the person who had secretly helped Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian also looked around. At this moment, the sun was shining brightly, and her nose was filled with the fragrance of grass and flowers.

Previously, someone had secretly fired a shot to save her, but there didn’t seem to be anyone else nearby.

Who exactly was helping her in secret?

Qiao Nian’s eyes were filled with confusion.

“Did you see the person who saved me just now?” Qiao Nian turned to look at Gu Zhou and asked.

Gu Zhou shook his head. “I didn’t see anyone else. Perhaps that person has already left!”

Qiao Nian nodded slightly. She and Gu Zhou had been delayed for a while inside. The good person who had done good deeds without leaving his name had probably left.

The two of them walked towards the east of the road. Just as they arrived, they saw six cars instantly stop.

Chen Qing got out of the car first. His gaze fell on Qiao Nian. Seeing that Qiao Nian was unscathed, he heaved a sigh of relief.

Gu Zhou looked at Chen Qing and said, “Go back to the hotel now!”

“Yes,” Chen Qing agreed.

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian got into the car. After fastening their seat belts, Chen Qing began to drive.

Qiao Nian leaned lazily against the back of the chair, then took out the silver needles she had used previously and disinfected them with a lighter.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian, who was sitting beside him. She was sitting by the car window. Sunlight filtered through the car window, coating her face with a layer of gold.

The silver needle in her hand flickered with golden light.

When Gu Zhou saw her silver needles, he suddenly recalled the first time they had met.

At that time, Qiao Nian had arrived at the Gu residence and subdued his snake with a silver needle.

That scene was still vivid in hus mind, as if it had happened yesterday.

It seemed that not only could Qiao Nian’s silver needles treat illnesses, but they could also protect her.

After disinfecting every silver needle, Qiao Nian put them away again. Sensing Gu Zhou’s gaze, she looked at him in confusion. Puzzled, she asked, “What’s wrong?”

Gu Zhou’s eyes were very bright, like stars in the night sky. They were dazzling.

Gu Zhou shook his head gently and didn’t speak. He just reached out and held Qiao Nian’s hand, his fingers gently caressing the back of her hand.

Qiao Nian sensed Gu Zhou’s movements. With a smile in her eyes, she recalled that he seemed to be looking for something in the living room just now. She asked curiously, “What were you looking for in the villa?”

“I found this beside Takeda.” As Gu Zhou spoke, he took out the steel bullet from his pocket and handed it to Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian took the steel bullet from Gu Zhou and turned it over and over, her eyes filled with surprise. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“This is…”

“It’s the steel bullet that hit the back of Takeda’s hand,” Gu Zhou said honestly.
