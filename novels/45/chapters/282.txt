Chapter 283: Out of Tune

Seeing Xia Xue’s shocked expression, Gao Lin smiled and said obediently, “Sister Xia Xue, are we telepathic? Are we thinking the same thing?”

Xia Xue didn’t know what to say.

The surrounding students grew excited.

“Speaking of which, I really want to hear Senior Xia Xue play ‘Missing’. I heard that Senior Xia Xue was recognized by Brother Cao because of this song. Her playing is better than Qiao Nian’s.”

“Qiao Nian’s playing just now was already touching enough. If Senior Xia Xue plays, won’t we have to cry for a long time?”

“That’s right, that’s right. I almost couldn’t walk away from Qiao Nian’s performance just now. She played so well. I’m already completely immersed in sorrow!”

…

The other students spoke at once. Xia Xue couldn’t choose any other song even if she wanted to.

If she had to choose, she would choose a song that was even more difficult than “Missing”. If that didn’t work, then she would just shut up obediently, lest she embarrass herself!

Xia Xue’s eyes darted around. After some thought, she looked at Brother Cao tactfully and asked tentatively, “Brother Cao asked me to practice the tune from the concert. If I play ‘Missing’, won’t that be a little inappropriate?”

Actually, she hoped that Brother Cao would let her change the song.

Then, Brother Cao couldn’t read her mind at all. He waved his hand casually and said sensibly, “It’s fine. Any song will do. Since everyone likes this song, just play it. We have to put the audience first!”

Xia Xue wanted to cry but had no tears!

However, at this point, she could only brace herself and hope that she could perform well this time.

Naturally, Gao Lin didn’t notice Xia Xue’s dilemma. She looked at Qiao Nian smugly, as if waiting for Qiao Nian to surrender.

At this moment, Xia Xue placed the violin on her left shoulder. She took a deep breath and prepared to play the tune.

The sound of the violin which had a sense of longing, could be heard.

Xia Xue’s forehead was covered in sweat, and her breathing was getting heavier. Her mind raced, thinking about how to avoid making a mistake.

The students were also listening intently. Everyone was immersed in the song.

“That sounds alright!”

“It doesn’t feel the same as Qiao Nian’s!”

“Everyone has a different style. Alright, stop talking. Everyone, listen carefully!”

…

However, towards the end of the song, the students all frowned in unison. They felt that something was wrong with this song.

Gao Lin had also discovered something strange about this song.

There seemed to be a few things wrong.

What was wrong with Sister Xia Xue? Why was she out of tune?

Qiao Nian sat at the side, listening to Xia Xue play the piano. Her lips curved up slightly, and a trace of coldness flashed in her eyes, filled with contempt.

She had thought that Xia Xue was quite capable, but she didn’t expect this.

How was this any different from a child?

With such standards, how could she be a female musician for Mr. Dong Hua?

“Strange, what’s wrong with Senior Xia Xue?”

“I don’t know. Why does she sound so awful?”

“This isn’t her standard!”

“She used to play the violin at the Welcome Gala. Her violin skills were quite good. Why are her violin skills so bad now?”

“Could it be that Qiao Nian’s playing is really too pleasant to the ear? If we compare these two sounds, we’ll think that Xia Xue’s is simply too awful to listen to.”

“I don’t know, but this also means that she’s not very capable. Why would Brother Cao like her?”

“Who knows? Perhaps Sister Xia Xuexue has someone in her family helping her!”

“That’s probably the case!”

“Sigh, I’m really disappointed. I thought our department’s belle was very good. I didn’t expect her to be not so good!”

“Hurry up and choose a new faculty belle. I don’t want to hear anyone praise her again!” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

When Xia Xue heard her classmates’ words, it was as if they had slapped her one after another. The pain was unbearable.
