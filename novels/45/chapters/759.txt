760 Auntie Nian Nian

“I just thought that Daddy and Mommy couldn’t be together. We might never be able to live together.” Xiao Shi sighed and said like a little adult, “The adults often say that when the fate of husband and wife runs out, they will break up. The fate of Daddy and Mommy has already expired. A melon that’s expired won’t be sweet. It’s better to let nature take its course. Auntie Nian Nian should be a very good person, right? That’s why Daddy likes her. You like her too, right?” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Gu Qi nodded seriously and said, “Previously, I thought the same as you. I think with Auntie Nian Nian around, Dad and Mommy can’t be together, but not only does Auntie Nian Nian treat me well, but she also protects me. If Auntie Nian Nian stays with Mommy, I think it’ll be better!”

Xiao Shi was speechless.

“So don’t be sad. When you see Auntie Nian Nian, you’ll definitely like her!” Gu Qi clenched his hands tightly and said seriously, “Then Dad will be in charge of earning money, and Auntie Nian Nian and Mommy will be in charge of protecting and taking care of us!”

!!

When he was young, he thought about it seriously. This seemed to be good.

Gu Qi continued, “By the way, I want to tell Auntie Nian Nian about you coming here. When the time comes, I’ll get Auntie Nian Nian to arrange for you to meet Dad. However, I don’t know if you’re willing to meet Auntie Nian Nian.”

Xiao Shi naturally trusted her brother’s judgment.

She hurriedly nodded and said, “Brother Xiao Qi, I believe Auntie Nian Nian must be a very good person. I’m willing to see her!”

Gu Qi revealed a relaxed smile.

He still remembered that in kindergarten, Auntie Nian Nian had hit that bad teacher for him.

Auntie Nian Nian was the most powerful person in the world. Not only could she protect him, but she would also take care of him.

Gu Qi walked into the villa with Xiao Shi. After closing the door, he took out his phone and called Qiao Nian.

At the Gu family’s pharmacy.

Previously, Gu Zhou had not slept well. Qiao Nian wanted to make some calming pills for him. She was preparing medicine in the medicinal room when she heard her phone ring. She stopped what she was doing and took out her phone.

When Qiao Nian saw that the caller ID was Gu Qi, a trace of surprise flashed in her eyes.

“Xiao Qi?” After Qiao Nian picked up the call, she placed the phone to her ear, her voice involuntarily gentle.

“Auntie Nian Nian, can you come to Dongjiang to look for me?”

Gu Qi’s serious voice came from the phone.

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. Only then did she realize that Gu Qi didn’t go to school today. Instead, he was at the east villa.

Could something have happened to Gu Qi?

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian stopped what she was doing and asked anxiously, “Xiao Qi, did something happen again? Don’t panic first. Tell me slowly.”

“Auntie Nian Nian, come over now. I want to tell you something very important in person!”

“Alright, then wait for me there obediently. I’ll go over now!”

Qiao Nian’s mind was in a mess.

Gu Qi, who was supposed to go to school, suddenly went to the Dongjiang villa.

Gu Qi was very obedient. Something must have happened for him to go to the Dongjiang villa.

Qiao Nian hurriedly took off her apron and walked out. Just as she reached the door of the medicinal room, she saw Gu Zhou walking over.

Gu Zhou’s face was a little sickly pale, but this did not affect his handsome appearance.

He was wearing a bathrobe. The bathrobe was loose, and his strong and perfect chest muscles were faintly discernible.

For some reason, Gu Zhou’s words yesterday lingered in Qiao Nian’s ears. She was even more nervous now.

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze slightly. Remembering that Gu Qi still had something to discuss with her, she hurriedly said, “I’ll go out for a while.”

She passed by Gu Zhou, but he grabbed her arm.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion and asked, “What’s wrong?”

“Is it urgent?”

Qiao Nian nodded.

Gu Zhou had just heard from the servants that Qiao Nian was making pills for him. It must be very important for Qiao Nian to leave now.

“Where are you going? Do you want me to send you over?” Gu Zhou asked.

Qiao Nian thought about how Gu Qi had specially called her. It seemed that Gu Qi had no intention of letting Gu Zhou know, so she shook her head and said, “I can go over myself. Why don’t you go upstairs and rest first?”
