Hearing Xiao Feng’s flawed lie, Qiao Nian’s lips curved up coldly.

The Gu family was rich. Xiao Feng had actually casually bought a third-grade medicine for Matriarch Gu.

Where was Xiao Feng’s brain?

She was a doctor. Although she didn’t go home last night, why didn’t Xiao Feng bring the pills for her to examine? Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

What did she give them to Matriarch Gu directly? What exactly was Xiao Feng thinking?

Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou and saw him sitting there coldly, as if he didn’t believe Xiao Feng’s words.

It was obvious that Matriarch Gu did not believe Xiao Yue’s words either. Matriarch Gu said with a dark expression, “As long as we investigate the surveillance cameras, the truth will be revealed!”

Gu Zhou couldn’t be bothered to watch Xiao Feng perform anymore, so he said to the butler, “Just call the police. Don’t waste any more time! The Gu family can’t keep such a cruel person!”

Just as Xiao Feng was about to say something, she was taken out by the security guards.

“Young Master, Young Madam, I’m innocent. I really didn’t want to harm Old Madam. I just wanted to help Old Madam!” Xiao Feng cried and shouted when she was taken away!

Matriarch Gu turned to look at Qiao Nian and said softly, “Nian Nian, come with me for a while!”

Qiao Nian helped Matriarch Gu upstairs.

Matriarch Gu walked upstairs step by step. Jiang Yue’s face flashed across her mind, and she recalled Xiao Feng, who had taken the initiative to plead guilty just now. Her chest felt as if it had been pricked by a needle.

She was a kind person. When she met poor children, she would bring them home.

She hoped that every child could grow up in a warm family.

Although her home was not those children’s, she could at least save them from the wind and rain.

However, she had never expected it to turn out like this.

Jiang Yue was jealous of Qiao Nian. She had poisoned her, hurt her, and even wanted to hurt Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian.

Xiao Feng had poisoned her in the name of doing her best.

If there was really such good medicine, how could her grandson not know? How could Nian Nian not know?

But why had Xiao Feng become like this?

The two girls she cared about wanted her dead.

Who else could she trust?

When she returned to Matriarch Gu’s room, Qiao Nian saw that Matriarch Gu didn’t look well. She glanced at Gu Zhou, who was beside her, and gave him a look.

After some thought, Gu Zhou walked up to Matriarch Gu and said, “Grandma, the past is in the past. Don’t think too much about it!”

“Was I in the wrong?” Matriarch Gu looked at Gu Zhou, then at Qiao Nian. “I shouldn’t have brought them back to the Gu family back then!”

At that time, she took Jiang Yue in as her god granddaughter because she pitied Jiang Yue for having no one to take care of her.

It was also because Xiao Feng’s grades were good, but she didn’t have the time to study hard. She could only work and study outside, so she wanted to give Xiao Feng a high-paying job.

But the two of them had almost killed her.

“Grandma, they were the ones who couldn’t control their desires. It has nothing to do with you.” Gu Zhou smiled and comforted her.

“The two of you are both good children!” As Matriarch Gu spoke, the light in her eyes gradually disappeared. She looked at Gu Zhou and continued, “Go out for a while. I have something to tell Nian Nian!”

Gu Zhou gave Qiao Nian a look that said, “Take good care of Matriarch Gu.” He turned around and left.

Qiao Nian helped Matriarch Gu sit down on the sofa and comforted her. “Grandma, don’t think too much about it. This has nothing to do with you. It’s all their fault.”

Matriarch Gu let out a long sigh and continued, “Nian Nian, what I regret the most is not taking good care of you, causing you to almost be hurt!”

Back then, when Qiao Nian told her that there was something wrong with Jiang Yue, she didn’t believe that the child she had raised would become so sarcastic.

Now, it seemed that Qiao Nian was the most genuine. Nian Nian was really a good child that was rarely seen in a hundred years. It was Gu Zhou’s blessing to be able to marry Nian Nian, and also the Gu family’s blessing.

“Grandma, actually, you’ve treated me very well. You didn’t let me down. I’m already very happy to have you as my grandmother!” Qiao Nian said sincerely.
