Chapter 52: I’m Not the Antidote!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Being in such close contact with Gu Zhou, Qiao Nian had to tip her head back to look at his face. He seemed to be the most perfect masterpiece crafted in heaven. His facial features were well-defined, and his eyes were two deep pools. Coupled with his cool, stoic aura, she couldn’t help but want to throw herself at him.

At this moment, Qiao Nian felt extremely shallow. She only cared about his looks.

Qiao Nian licked her lips.

At this moment, Gu Zhou let go of her in one swift motion.

“Plop!”

The water in the bathtub splashed across the floor.

Qiao Nian awkwardly sat up straight and coughed twice. Only then did she manage to get rid of the water stuck in her throat. She was much more awake now.

“Gu Zhou!” Qiao Nian leaned against the side of the bathtub, feeling as if she was barely alive. She said unhappily, “Did you need to do that? You’re a man, and I’m not ugly. You won’t lose out.”

Gu Zhou’s expression darkened. He looked down commandingly at Qiao Nian and said, “I’m a human being, not the antidote!”

“When a man is in bed, isn’t…” Before Qiao Nian finished her sentence, she remembered what had happened five years ago. The light in her eyes dimmed. “Bring me my silver needles.”

Weakly, Qiao Nian sank into the bathtub, letting the water run over her face.

Gu Zhou grabbed Qiao Nian’s head and pulled her towards the surface. “Are you sure you can do this?”

“Where are the silver needles?” Qiao Nian smiled. “Or are you willing to be the antidote?”

Gu Zhou hesitated for a moment, looking at Qiao Nian suspiciously. “Are you sure you can do it now?”

“Yes.” Qiao Nian’s voice was just a shade alluring. She lay her head against the side of the bathtub and smiled at Gu Zhou. “They’re in the drawer of the dressing table.”

Gu Zhou turned around and walked to the dressing table. He pulled open the drawer and saw a wooden box engraved with flowers. When he opened the box, he saw the silver needles.

He was about to enter the bathroom when the door to the room opened.

Gu Zhou looked over coldly, frowning.

Jiang Yue walked in with a pot. When she saw Gu Zhou, her face flushed red uncontrollably. Overcome by shyness, she lowered her gaze.

He seemed to be soaked. His hair was dripping with water. The buttons on his shirt were unbuttoned slightly, and she could just make out the drops of water on his chest.

Jiang Yue lowered her head, trying hard to get her breathing and her state of mind under control. She was afraid that she would not be able to hold back and would throw herself at Gu Zhou.

A trace of ice flashed in Gu Zhou’s eyes as he said coldly, “Why are you here?” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Hearing Gu Zhou’s cold voice, Jiang Yue bit her lip. After some hesitation, she looked up at Gu Zhou and said apologetically, “I heard from the servants that Second Sister-in-law seemed to be drunk, so I made some hangover stew and brought it over. I didn’t expect to disturb you and Second Sister-in-law. I’m really sorry!”

Jiang Yue didn’t see Qiao Nian around, so she was trying to sound out where she could be.

“You are disturbing us.” Gu Zhou glanced coldly at Jiang Yue, his irritation obvious. “Since you knew you would disturb us, why did you come?”

Just as Jiang Yue was about to reply, a seductive voice came from the bathroom.

“Gu Zhou, have you found it?”

Jiang Yue turned to look towards the bathroom. This voice was different from how Qiao Nian usually spoke.

Could Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou have already…

Jiang Yue turned pale in shock. Her hands trembled, and the bowl of hangover soup slipped from her grip, spilling all over the floor.

“I’m sorry.” While speaking, Jiang Yue bent down to pick up the soup bowl.

“Get out.” Gu Zhou’s expression was frigid as he frowned at Jiang Yue. “I remember explicitly saying that no woman is allowed to enter the second floor.”

Jiang Yue bit her lip, tears swirling in her eyes.

Wasn’t he afraid of women?

Why did he carry Qiao Nian into the villa?

She had been by his side for so long. Why couldn’t he give her just another glance?

Jiang Yue stood up unwillingly and turned to leave, not forgetting to close the door.

Gu Zhou walked to the door and locked it without hesitation, then walked back to the bathroom.

When he stepped into the bathroom, he saw Qiao Nian leaning against the bathtub, looking at him innocently.
