Chapter 1764 - 1764 Truth

Chen Sheng paused. He originally only wanted to use Old General Cui’s pitiful story to force Cui Huai to admit his true identity. He did not expect Cui Huai to take off his disguise and reveal his face.

It was as if he was a hostage who had been kidnapped by the kidnappers. If he hadn’t seen the kidnappers’ real faces yet, as long as the kidnappers got the ransom, he could leave safely.

But it was different now.

He saw the kidnapper’s face. Then he was in the same boat as the kidnapper. The kidnapper either treated him as one of his own or would kill him directly.

Chen Sheng knew in his heart that he was in a very dangerous situation. He forced himself to calm down and pretended to be shocked as he looked at Cui Huai.

Cui Huai threw the mask on the desk and tapped his fingers on the table. He glanced at Chen Sheng and gestured for him to sit down.

Chen Sheng was stunned for a moment before sitting on the chair beside him.

When Cui Huai saw Chen Sheng like this, a smile flashed across his eyes, but he quickly regained his composure. He said in a low voice, “All these years, I’ve been living with a mask on. After wearing the mask for so long, everyone thinks that I’m Cui Huai, but I’m the only one who knows that I’m Cui Si, the Cui Si who was loyal to the country but was killed.”

Cui Huai looked at Chen Sheng seriously. His eyes gradually darkened as he said, “Chen Sheng, you’re different from them.”Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“It’s not that I don’t trust you,” Cui Huai said after some serious thought. “You’re different from the others. You’re too smart. I don’t dare to trust you completely.”

Cui Huai had sharp eyes. He had seen many people, but this was the first time he had seen a mysterious person like Chen Sheng. He could not figure him out, and he was very vigilant against people he could not see through.

Especially Chen Sheng’s eyes. There was no light in his dark eyes. No one could tell what he was thinking.

Chen Sheng knew very well what he needed to say after being deep in thought.

He put away the surprise on his face and his lips slowly curled up. His eyes gradually lit up. “Boss, I-I’m very happy.”

Chen Sheng’s words stunned Cui Huai. He narrowed his eyes slightly, his eyes filled with confusion.

Chen Sheng sat slightly forward and looked at Cui Huai intently. His eyes were filled with joy as he said excitedly, “I really didn’t expect you to tell me the truth. This is something I didn’t dare to think about in the past. I’m really happy that you’re willing to tell me all of this clearly. This means that our relationship is better than before, right?”

This was the first time Cui Huai had seen Chen Sheng as happy as a child. Although Chen Sheng was not young anymore, he had always kept his emotions hidden in the past. This was the first time he had revealed his emotions.

“Is that so?” Cui Huai asked with a fake smile. He had a smile on his face, but he was still suspicious of Chen Sheng.

When Chen Sheng heard Cui Huai, he retracted his smile slightly and said without hesitation, “Of course, Boss. You don’t know, but this is the first time I’m being so honest with you. After following you for so many years, I really hope to be honest with you. It’s just that I’m usually afraid that if I say something wrong, you will misunderstand. Now, I can tell you the truth.”

He knew very well that Cui Huai liked simple-minded people, like Sha He and Ba Song. This was because they did not have much thought and were good at fighting. They were straightforward and easy to control.

He was prepared to cater to Cui Huai’s taste and pretend to be a hot-blooded clueless youth.

“Boss, actually, I guessed your identity previously. Since it’s really as I thought, Boss, what should we do next?”

“What do you mean?” Cui Huai’s hand under the table involuntarily clenched. He was completely stunned by Chen Sheng. His fingers moved slightly, indicating for the sniper not far away to temporarily be on standby.

Chen Sheng pretended to be confused and frowned. “Boss, aren’t I aligned with you? Are you really not going to do anything?”
