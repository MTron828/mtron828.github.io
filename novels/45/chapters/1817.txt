Chapter 1818 - 1818 Sneaking Away

After Gu Qi finished reading it, he said, “Mommy wants to test our skills. She wants us to avoid our family and secretly go to the backyard.”

“It’s so exciting. It’s like playing hide-and-seek,” Xiao Bao said excitedly. This game was really fun. He could see his mommy and have fun.

Xiao Shi revealed a gentle and bright smile.

Gu Qi nodded.

The three little ones got out of bed and were about to go out hand in hand. Gu Qi seemed to have thought of something and immediately became serious. “If we’re not in the room, it must be very quiet. That way, our uncles and aunties will realize that we’ve all left.”

Gu Qi was very experienced in sneaking out. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have avoided the nanny, bodyguards, and cameras back then.

Xiao Shi took out her phone from her pocket and opened a page. She said, “Let’s pretend that we’re watching television. That way, they won’t suspect that we went out.”

Xiao Shi turned on the video and did not forget to turn up the volume. Then, she placed her phone on the bed.

“Alright, let’s go,” Gu Qi said with relief.

The three children carefully walked out of the room and hurriedly walked towards the stairs. When they reached the first floor, they saw that there were still servants in the living room.

The three little ones only used the cover of the furniture to sneak out.

They ran from the living room and headed straight for the backyard.

When Xiao Bao was in MY, he often trained with Chang Feng and the others. He was better than the other two.

Gu Qi followed. The three of them walked under the shadows of the trees that perfectly covered their figures.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The night was as cold as water.

The moonlight tonight was very faint. Fortunately, the street lamps were still bright enough to illuminate the garden path.

When they reached the backyard, they could only see trees in the darkness and no one at all.

The three little ones continued to walk in and saw a person sitting in the pavilion from afar.

“It’s Mommy!” Xiao Bao shouted excitedly and ran straight to the pavilion.

Qiao Nian didn’t enter through the Lu family’s main entrance. Instead, she avoided the guards from the side wall and secretly climbed in.

Her position was very close to the wall. When she heard Xiao Bao’s voice, she hurriedly stood up.

Qiao Nian smiled at the three children, her eyes slightly red.

“Children.” As soon as Qiao Nian finished speaking, the three children ran towards her.

Xiao Bao was the first to run to Qiao Nian’s side and hug her. His voice was a little choked. “Mommy, Xiao Bao misses you so much.”

Qiao Nian felt Xiao Bao’s slightly trembling body and patted his back gently. She said gently, “Xiao Bao is so obedient!”

Qiao Nian let go of Xiao Bao slightly and lowered her head to kiss him on the forehead.

At this moment, Xiao Shi also threw herself into Qiao Nian’s arms.

On Qiao Nian’s left was Xiao Bao, and on her right was Xiao Shi. She smiled and kissed Xiao Shi’s forehead again. She looked at Gu Qi, who was not far away, and revealed a gentle smile.

Gu Qi was like an adult. He stood there with one hand in his pocket, looking cold.

When Gu Qi sensed Qiao Nian looking over, he looked very calm, as if he was already a big child and did not need his mother to hug him.

Qiao Nian pulled Gu Qi into her arms and kissed him on the forehead.

Fortunately, the three little ones were still young and she could hug them by herself.

Qiao Nian knew that Gu Qi was as bad at expressing himself like his father. As his mother, she naturally had to take the initiative to express herself.

“Mommy still likes to hug you guys the most.” Qiao Nian hugged them contentedly. Her children were too obedient and cute. She couldn’t get enough of them.

Gu Qi knew that his mother was talking to him, and the corners of his lips could not help but curl up.
After a while, Gu Qi looked up at Qiao Nian and asked curiously, “Mommy, didn’t Daddy come back with you?”

Qiao Nian initially thought that Gu Zhou would come after meeting Grandma Gu. Now, it seemed that he hadn’t come yet.

Qiao Nian explained with a smile, “Didn’t your grandmother go back to the Gu family? He went to visit her first. I think you’ll see him tomorrow. Do you want to see Dad more?”
