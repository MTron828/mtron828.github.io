Chapter 320: Punishment

When Chen Qing heard Gu Zhou’s words, he sighed helplessly. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

He naturally knew what Second Young Master was thinking.

Back then, Second Young Master was drugged, which was why that incident happened during the Mid-Autumn Festival.

After that, Second Young Master began to investigate what happened that night. However, a powerful force had been hiding everything that happened that night.

Now that five years had passed, they still hadn’t found out who the other party was or what their motives were.

Moreover, if the other party knew that the deceased Young Master had been picked up by the Gu family, the Young Master would probably be in danger.

Gu Zhou reluctantly moved his gaze away from Gu Qi’s face. His gaze fell on Chen Qing’s face and he said, “After you’ve asked her clearly, throw her into jail!”

“Yes.” After Chen Qing agreed, he walked downstairs.

About three hours later, Chen Qing returned.

This time, Gu Zhou did not let Chen Qing in. Instead, he walked out and spoke to Chen Qing at the end of the corridor.

Chen Qing immediately reported everything he had found to Gu Zhou. “We’ve investigated everything. Zhang Yi has been sent to prison.”

“Ok.”

“Six years ago, Zhang Yi was at Professor Wang’s house. The first time she saw you, she fell in love with you. After Professor Wang was paralyzed, she took extremely good care of him. Later on, Young Master had no one to take care of him, so he began to harbor evil intentions. He persuaded Professor Wang to send her over to take care of Young Master.”

At the thought of Zhang Yi’s desperate state, a trace of disdain flashed in Chen Qing’s eyes. He continued, “She was worried that Young Master would be smart and capable enough to inherit the family business in the future, so she wanted to raise Young Master to have an inferiority complex. Only then would her child inherit the family business after she married Second Young Master.”

Towards the end, Chen Qing was so angry that his hands were trembling. “She was worried that we would find out that she had bullied Young Master, so she punished him physically. She often made Young Master stand up instead of sleeping. This time, Young Master threw a tantrum and refused to accept physical punishment. In a fit of anger, she slapped Young Master twice. In a rage, Young Master ran out.”

Gu Zhou narrowed his eyes, exuding a cold aura. “If she can still see the sun tomorrow, I’ll hold you responsible!”

Chen Qing was also very dissatisfied with Zhang Yi. He immediately replied, “Yes.”

Even if Second Young Master did not say so, he would not let a woman like Zhang Yi live.

“You may leave!” Gu Zhou said tiredly. He massaged his temples and walked towards Gu Qi’s room.

He walked to Gu Qi’s bed and sat down. The coldness in his eyes gradually dissipated, replaced by a trace of warmth.

His heart ached slightly. When he wasn’t around, this child must have suffered a lot.

It was all his fault for not taking good care of Gu Qi in the past.

“I’ll take good care of you in the future. I’ll be a qualified father,” Gu Zhou said softly.

Gu Qi’s lips curved up slightly, as if he had a very happy dream.

The dark clouds in Gu Zhou’s heart gradually dissipated. He lowered his head slightly and placed a light kiss on Gu Qi’s forehead.

The next morning, Chen Qing rushed over and saw Gu Zhou making breakfast for Gu Qi. He was so shocked that his jaw almost dropped to the ground.

Seeing Gu Zhou like this, Chen Qing suddenly realized that it must be because of what happened last night that made Second Young Master care for Young Master.

“Has the matter been resolved?”

When Chen Qing heard Gu Zhou’s question, he immediately stood up straight and said respectfully, “It’s been resolved. Just an hour ago, the female prisoners in the prison found out that Zhang Yi had committed child abuse. All of them were furious, and they joined forces to beat Zhang Yi up. While Zhang Yi was running away, she accidentally hit the wall and suffered a cerebral hemorrhage. She died on the spot!”

The sun was shining brightly outside. The sunlight filtered through the window, adding a lot of warmth to the entire room.

Chen Qing stood there and thought for a while. He said with uncertainty, “Second Young Master, there’s one more thing. It’s about Young Master. I don’t know if I should tell you.”
