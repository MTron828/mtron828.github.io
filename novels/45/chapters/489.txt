Chapter 490: Qiao Xin Returns Home

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Lu Zhu’s face. His face was pale, and his lips were pale. He looked listless.

She retracted her gaze and sat down beside Gu Zhou. She placed the box in her hand on the table at the side. “I brought breakfast for you and Chen Qing. Eat it while it’s hot!”

When Chen Qing, who was standing guard at the side, heard Qiao Nian’s words, he was flattered. He hadn’t expected his breakfast to be served to him.

Qiao Nian handed Chen Qing his breakfast. Chen Qing hurriedly took it.

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. He asked softly, “Have you had breakfast?”

“Yes.”

After breakfast, Lu Zhu still did not wake up.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but frown worriedly. But on second thought, Lu Zhu was so seriously injured that it was normal for him to be unconscious.

Just then, Qiao Nian’s phone suddenly rang.

It broke the silence of the ward.

Qiao Nian hurriedly took out her phone and turned the volume to the lowest before walking out.

If the call was from Qiao Yu and she didn’t answer, he might keep calling.

When Qiao Nian walked out, she saw that it was Qiao Yu.

She stood in the hallway before answering.

“Tell me, what else do you want?” Qiao Nian asked coldly.

There was a pause on the other end of the line, then Qiao Yu said, “I found Qiao Xin. She’s in the warehouse of our back garden.”

Qiao Nian was slightly taken aback by Qiao Yu’s words. Puzzled, she asked, “When did she go back?”

When Qiao Yu had called her earlier, she had thought that Qiao Xin was still in MY.

“She doesn’t know what’s going on herself.”

Although Qiao Nian was a little puzzled, on second thought, this matter had nothing to do with her. She couldn’t be bothered to ask further. She said coldly, “Since she’s already home, don’t call me again!”

Qiao Yu’s originally old-fashioned and stern voice instantly softened. He said softly, “Nian’er, I’m really sorry. I was a little anxious previously!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

When Qiao Nian heard Qiao Yu’s words, her frown deepened. She hated this form of address, and her voice became even colder. “I’ve already told you before that I don’t like this form of address very much. Don’t call me that again!”

There was silence on the other end of the line for a few seconds, and Qiao Yu didn’t insist anymore. He said, “Qiao Xin said that on the first night of MY, she saw someone enter your room, but she didn’t see that person’s face. However, she didn’t expect someone to knock her out. When she woke up, she was already home. I think the person who knocked her out might be related to you. It’s a little chaotic over there. I think if it’s possible, you can check and see if the other party is a friend or foe.”

Qiao Nian’s eyes were filled with confusion when she heard Qiao Yu’s words. She asked, “Is there anything else?”

“She said that she wanted to take a photo of you with that man and send it to Gu Zhou.”

Qiao Nian was slightly taken aback. That man should be Gu Zhou.

Qiao Xin actually didn’t recognize Gu Zhou. Was Qiao Xin mistaken?

Regardless of whether Qiao Xin had seen it wrongly, it was indeed disgraceful for Qiao Xin to want to secretly take photos of her.

Besides, she wasn’t the one who sent Qiao Xin back.

However, Qiao Yu’s words made Qiao Nian realize that someone had helped her that night.

If that person was Qin Chuan, he would have tied Qiao Xin up in front of her and let her do whatever she wanted with her instead of sending her back quietly.

Qiao Nian retracted her thoughts and pursed her lips. “If there’s nothing else, I’m hanging up!”

“Yes.”

Qiao Nian hung up the phone and frowned. Other than Qin Chuan, who else would help her?
