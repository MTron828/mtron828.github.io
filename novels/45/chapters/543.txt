Chapter 544: Can I Really?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Lu Zhu felt uncomfortable. He could tell that Lu Rao had no intention of giving up on Qiao Nian. He felt that he had to tell Lu Rao as soon as possible that Qiao Nian was Sugar.

Lu Zhu’s expression was serious as he warned word by word, “I’m telling you, you can desire any woman in the world, but not her!”

Lu Rao stared unblinkingly at Lu Zhu. He had rarely seen Lu Zhu so nervous.

In the past, Lu Zhu had always looked indifferent, as if nothing had anything to do with him. Moreover, Lu Zhu had never cared about him in the past.

Strange! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

It was really strange!

Lu Rao looked at Lu Zhu without blinking. He frowned slightly and asked, “Brother, if I remember correctly, you’ve never cared about my private life in the past. Why do you care now?”

Lu Zhu felt a little guilty. He looked away, but his voice was even more serious than before. He warned again, “Ah Rao, let me tell you. You must never fall for Qiao Nian, understand?”

Lu Rao was used to being free since he was young. For a moment, he was a little unused to being controlled by his eldest brother. He was also very dissatisfied. He said perfunctorily, “I understand!”

Hearing Lu Rao’s tone, Lu Zhu knew that Lu Rao did not take his words to heart.

Although he had never cared about Lu Rao, and although Lu Rao was used to being carefree and had a carefree appearance, his private life was very clean. Moreover, Lu Rao had never been in a relationship.

Lu Zhu knew his younger brother better than anyone in this world. If his younger brother was certain of one thing, even ten bulls would not be able to bring him back.

Regardless of whether Lu Rao really wanted to woo Qiao Nian or if he was just saying it, Lu Zhu felt that this matter was very dangerous.

Lu Zhu didn’t dare to take the risk. He hurriedly took out his phone and sent Qiao Nian a text: Sugar, do you want to consider acknowledging your third brother first?

Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou were sitting in the car when her phone suddenly rang. She took it out and saw that it was a message from Lu Zhu. A trace of joy flashed in her eyes.

Qiao Nian still pretended to be very serious. She pursed her lips, not wanting others to see her joy.

She hurriedly replied, “Can I really?”

Actually, Qiao Nian was looking forward to reuniting with Third Brother.

When she thought of Third Brother’s handsome face, her heart began to race.

There was also Second Brother. Speaking of which, Second Brother was the first person who wanted to treat her as his younger sister.

However, after that concert, they had never contacted each other again. She didn’t know where Second Brother was either.

Gu Zhou, who was sitting next to Qiao Nian, could sense the joy emanating from her. Out of the corner of his eye, he glanced at Qiao Nian. When Qiao Nian took out her phone just now, he noticed the caller ID on the phone—Lu Zhu.

Gu Zhou was a little displeased. He turned to look out of the window.

Was she that happy to receive Lu Zhu’s text?

Gu Zhou’s brow furrowed deeper and deeper. He realized something bad.

Just now, he had realized that Qiao Nian was very happy, but he was unhappy because Qiao Nian had contacted Lu Zhu. Why would his emotions change because of Qiao Nian?

What was wrong with him today?

The current Qiao Nian seemed to be affecting his emotions. He didn’t like this feeling.

Chen Qing, who was sitting in front, suddenly felt the pressure coming from Second Young Master. He immediately cowered.

He stole a glance at the rearview mirror and saw Second Young Master’s dark expression. The coldness between his brows was oppressive.

Chen Qing took a deep breath. He didn’t know what was wrong with Second Young Master either. He seemed to be in a bad mood the entire day.

It was strange. In the past, when Second Young Madam spoke to other members of the opposite sex, Second Young Master did not have any other reaction!
