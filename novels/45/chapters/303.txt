Chapter 304: Threat

Seeing the aura Qiao Nian was exuding, Gao Lin was so frightened that she couldn’t speak.

For some reason, she felt that Qiao Nian was different from ordinary classmates. Qiao Nian was like Asura from hell, making one shudder.

In the end, Qiao Nian raised her voice and said, “If you don’t do as I say, don’t blame me for being impolite. Not only will the three of you be punished by the school, but you’ll also lose your foothold in An City.”

Gao Lin was initially a little afraid of Qiao Nian, but when she heard Qiao Nian’s last sentence, she immediately burst out laughing.

So Qiao Nian was just bluffing. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

How could she, Gao Lin, be frightened by Qiao Nian?

Gao Lin looked at Qiao Nian mockingly. “Qiao Nian, who do you think you are? You’re so arrogant. Those who don’t know better might think that you’re the president of the country!”

Qiao Nian looked at Gao Lin calmly and said, “I’ve already given you a chance. If you don’t cherish it, then blame me for being impolite!”

With that, Qiao Nian pulled Wang Xuan out.

Gao Lin walked out. She hurriedly took out her phone and called Xia Xue, then briefly explained what had just happened.

When Xia Xue heard this, she began to laugh. She said mockingly, “Qiao Nian must be desperate! She must be trying to scare us because she’s guilty. You don’t have to bother with her. In the end, her reputation will definitely be ruined, not ours!”

Gao Lin thought so too, so she said, “After this incident, she can forget about snatching your position in the future! What right does a kept mistress have to be Mr. Donghua’s female musician?”

When Xia Xue heard this, her lips curved up in a bright smile. “Alright, Mr. Dong Hua’s concert is about to happen. I still have to practice, so I won’t talk to you anymore!”

“Sister Xia Xue, you have to practice hard. I’ll hang up first. Bye!”

After Gao Lin hung up, she walked out smugly.

Downstairs.

Wang Xuan stood beside Qiao Nian. Seeing that Qiao Nian was texting, she asked slowly, “Aren’t we going to the training room to practice?”

When Qiao Nian heard Wang Xuan’s question, she looked up at her and asked seriously, “Didn’t you say that you wanted to hold a music gathering at the field? Let’s go now!”

Wang Xuan’s eyes widened as she looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief. Qiao Nian actually wanted to go for the event. She sighed helplessly. “Now that you’re embroiled in scandals, I don’t think those people will go for the vent. They don’t want to get into trouble! I think it’s better if we don’t go!”

When Qiao Nian heard Wang Xuan’s words, she raised her eyebrows slightly and said, “Whether they come or not, as an invited party, I should go. This is a courtesy, and also a fulfillment of my promise.”

At this moment, Qiao Nian’s phone rang.

Qiao Nian unlocked it and saw that Gu Zhou had sent her a WeChat message. “No problem.”

When Qiao Nian and Wang Xuan arrived at the field, there was indeed no one there.

That made sense. Now that such a big thing had happened to her, no one would be willing to get involved with her before they found out the truth.

Although no one was willing to attend the music gathering, many people came to watch the show.

They were all very curious as to whether Qiao Nian was a mistress who was kept by an old man as suggested by the post on Tieba.

When they arrived at the field, they saw Qiao Nian taking out her violin, preparing to play.

Beautiful music slowly flowed out of the violin. The onlookers could not help but be immersed in the sea of music.

After the song ended, Qiao Nian glanced at her watch. Twenty minutes had passed. Her red lips curved up slightly.
