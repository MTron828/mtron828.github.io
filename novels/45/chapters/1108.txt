1109 A studious child

Gu Qi looked at Qiao Nian and said seriously, “The nanny who took care of me previously said that Xiao Qi jumped out of a rock!”

Seeing how serious the two children were, Gu Zhou said, “Of course your mommy gave birth to you!”

Xiao Shi blinked in confusion. Her gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s stomach and she shook her head like a wave. “But Mommy’s stomach is so small. How can she give birth to Xiao Shi like this?”

Just as Qiao Nian was about to speak, her phone suddenly rang.

Qiao Nian threw the biology textbook to Gu Zhou and said with a smile, “Tell the two children that I’ll take a call!”

Gu Zhou was speechless.

Qiao Nian walked out. When she reached the corridor, she picked up the call. “Lu Qi?”

Lu Qi’s sigh came from the cell phone. “Sister, I’ve encountered a particularly complicated medical question. I’ve consulted many teachers and professors in the past, and I’ve investigated a lot of information, but I can’t solve it. Can you help me answer it?”

Qiao Nian knew that Lu Qi studied medicine. Previously, she had also paid attention to Lu Qi’s grades. Every year, Lu Qi would get first place in her exams. She couldn’t help but laugh. She asked dotingly, “What kind of question is it that makes you so troubled?”

“I discovered this question on the online forum in the past. The person who came up with this question seems to be a medical genius. He came up with a total of ten questions, and I’ve already answered nine of them. I don’t know how to do the remaining one!” Lu Qi said sadly. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Qiao Nian was also a medical fanatic. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have achieved so much in medicine. Her other achievements were all in the field she liked.

Qiao Nian said curiously, “Alright, just send me the question now!”

She wanted to see who could set the medical questions that could stump Lu Qi. Lu Qi was also a medical genius!

“Okay!” Lu Qi agreed obediently.

“By the way, is there any progress on the matter I asked you to investigate for me previously?” Qiao Nian thought of Jiang Chi and frowned. Previously, she promised to help Jiang Chi investigate the truth of Jiang Cheng’s death. She wanted to ask her brother directly, but her brother was agitated recently, so she wanted Lu Qi to help investigate first!

Lu Qi immediately remembered and hurriedly said, “Sister, I’ve already found out the information from investigating Jiang Cheng. I can guarantee that Big Brother definitely didn’t kill him. When Jiang Cheng lived in our house, he left a diary. However, this diary was placed in a box made of Luban locks. I can’t open it no matter what.”

Luban Lock?

Qiao Nian had studied the Luban lock in the past. She nodded and said, “Send me the diary. I’ll try to unlock the Luban lock!”

“Okay!”

After hanging up, Qiao Nian immediately received a question from Lu Qi.

When Qiao Nian saw the question, she was stunned. This question was clearly set by her grandfather!

When she was twelve years old, her grandfather had set a total of ten questions. These ten questions were handed to her and her senior brother so that she and her senior brother could use their medical knowledge to solve these ten difficult illnesses.

It had taken her and her senior brother a few years to solve this question. When she finished solving these questions, she realized that only by being able to use these knowledge points skillfully could she be an outstanding doctor!

At that time, her grandfather had given her a hundred marks and her senior brother a hundred marks. Her grandfather had even praised her for being talented in medicine. Although she was young, she had used the same time as her senior brothers to solve these ten questions.

Logically speaking, this set of questions shouldn’t have appeared on an online forum!

Who exactly posted these ten questions on the online forum?

It was impossible for her senior brother to post this question on the online forum. Could it be Grandpa?

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian walked towards the study. At the same time, she called Lu Qi and asked for a link to the online forum!

Lu Qi quickly sent the link to Qiao Nian. When Qiao Nian saw the ten questions on the forum, she was completely stunned!
