Chapter 637: The Feeling of Being Doted On

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but feel a lump in her throat.

In the past, she had always felt that Lu Zhu was a cold person and didn’t like to pay attention to her. Every time he looked at her, he would look annoyed.

However, what she did not expect was that this brother who looked so cold on the outside had healed the pain in her heart.

She looked up, trying hard not to let the tears in her eyes fall. She sniffled and said, “I want to eat grilled fish!”

“Okay.”

“I want to eat big crabs!”

“Okay.”

“I also want to eat big prawns!”

“Okay.”

“By the way, I still want to eat…”

When Lu Zhu heard Qiao Nian’s voice, his lips curved up slightly. He silently jotted it down on his computer.

When he heard Qiao Nian’s silence, he asked gently, “What else do you want to eat?”

“That spicy Latiao that can only be bought for fifty cents.”

Lu Zhu’s hand paused. Qiao Nian’s voice sounded shy, like that of a shy little girl.

This was the first time he had heard Qiao Nian speak in such a tone.

Lu Zhu’s entire body softened. He asked gently, “Do you like chili?”

“No, no. It’s just a fifty-cent spicy Latio.”

“Is there such food?” As Lu Zhu spoke, the computer began to search.

“There are.”

When Qiao Nian was young, she had always wanted to eat spicy sticks. However, her grandfather hoped that she could practice singing, so he kept an eye on her and refused to let her eat such junk food.

She didn’t eat much when she was young, so when she grew up, she savored the taste of spicy Latio even more.

When she was young, she had even seen her neighbor’s brother secretly buy spicy Latio for his neighbor’s sister.

At that time, she envied her neighbor’s younger sister. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

However, her neighbor’s brother had a bad temper and was not friendly to her, so she did not interact much with him.

Now that he thought about it, Big Brother was right. There was unconditional love and doting between relatives, but that was not the case for outsiders.

When Lu Zhu saw the introduction of Latiao on the computer, he said, “Alright, I’ll go prepare!”

“Thank you, Brother!” Qiao Nian’s eyes were filled with joy.

She felt very blessed to have such a good brother.

When Lu Zhu heard Qiao Nian’s happy voice, he became happy as well. When Gu Zhou’s face flashed in his mind, his expression froze for a moment. He asked seriously, “Sugar, are you like this when you’re with Gu Zhou?”

“Huh?” Qiao Nian was a little confused.

“Just like you were just now.”

Qiao Nian finally understood. Her brother was probably worried that she would be bullied by Gu Zhou. He was also humble and careful around Gu Zhou.

“Brother, don’t worry about me being by his side. Being by your side is different. You’re family, but he’s only my… other half.”

Relatives were related by blood. It was impossible to change that in this lifetime.

However, the other half was different. It could be replaced at will.

How could that be?

Moreover, if she tried to curry favor with Gu Zhou, wouldn’t she become a bootlicker?

How many good endings could a bootlicker have? In the end, they would all end up with nothing.

She was no fool.

When Lu Zhu heard Qiao Nian’s words, he felt relieved. “Alright, that’s good.”

Qiao Nian smiled and nodded. “Okay.” Suddenly, she recalled what Matriarch Gu had said to her.

At that time, she suspected that the formation of Gu Chuan’s personality might have been because of the disappearance of the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

Matriarch Gu was unwilling to say much about the past, but she felt that her eldest brother should remember everything.

“Brother, I know that you’re very close to Gu Zhou. I want to ask if he’s seen me before?”

The smile on Lu Zhu’s face gradually disappeared, and his expression turned serious.

Speaking of this, he got angry.

Back then, when Sugar was one month old, they only dared to look at their obedient sister from afar. They didn’t even dare to touch her, afraid that they would hurt her.

Gu Zhou was quite bold. The moment he saw Sugar, he bit her face.

Teeth marks were left on her little face.

The bite mark lasted for a week before disappearing.

After this, they had even gotten into a fight with Gu Zhou.

What an unpleasant memory.

“Why are you suddenly asking about the past?” Lu Zhu asked in confusion.

It wasn’t convenient for Qiao Nian to say anything about Gu Chuan’s personality. After all, this was Gu Zhou’s private matter.
