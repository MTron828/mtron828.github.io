Chapter 1058 - 1058 I Trust Him

1058 I Trust Him

Yu Chu’s entire face was extremely red. She looked down shyly and said in a low voice, “Brother Ah Zhou, when I found out that you and Second Sister-in-law were married, I sincerely wanted to give you my blessings and planned to agree to Senior’s confession, but…”

The joy on Yu Chu’s face gradually disappeared. She lowered her gaze and said in disappointment, “I didn’t expect Teacher to have such thoughts. I just think that if Brother Ah Zhou was around, I might have the courage to say my thoughts.”

Qiao Nian looked at Yu Chu’s timid and afraid expression at first. When she heard her words and saw how shy Yu Chu was because she was about to fall in love, she could sense Yu Chu’s sincerity.

She felt that Yu Chu was an introverted young lady. She didn’t dare to refute the adults’ words, but she yearned for freedom.

Gu Zhou looked at Yu Chu’s face. They could be considered childhood sweethearts. Yu Chu was a very innocent person. Everything was written on his face. He could tell that Yu Chu was not lying. “Yes.”

Yu Chu lowered her head and took a sip of water from the cup in front of her. Only then did she look at Qiao Nian with a red face and promise seriously, “Second Sister-in-law, don’t worry. I really won’t disturb you. I hope you can forgive me for being rash this time!”

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but have a good impression of straight girls. Her lips curved up slightly as she said gently, “I believe you, and…”

Qiao Nian paused and looked at Gu Zhou. When their eyes met, she said, “I believe him.”

Gu Zhou looked into Qiao Nian’s eyes, which were as bright as the stars in the sky. Under the light, her devastatingly beautiful face looked like top-grade unpolished jade. She was so beautiful that one couldn’t take their eyes off her.

Gu Zhou felt that the best luck he had in his life was meeting Qiao Nian.

Seeing Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian’s lingering gazes, Yu Chu couldn’t help but think of the senior she liked. Her lips curved up slightly, and she lowered her gaze with a smile.

Gu Zhou reached out and held Qiao Nian’s hand. He clearly had a thousand words to say, but at this moment, he was so excited that he couldn’t say a word.

At this moment, the door of the private room opened.

The three of them came back to their senses and looked towards the door of the private room.

Yu Chu’s face turned even redder. She knew that her teacher did not want Second Sister-in-law to enter the private room, but if she insisted on inviting her in, her teacher would definitely be angry.

She stood up timidly and walked to the door. Lowering her head, she called out, “Teacher.”

Bai Hui didn’t even look at Yu Chu. Her beautiful phoenix-like eyes were fixed on Qiao Nian’s face. Her gaze was like thousands of ice arrows, shooting mercilessly at Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou stood up.

Qiao Nian looked at Bai Hui neither servile nor overbearing. Her gaze was as calm as ever, without a trace of fear. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

At this moment, Qiao Nian realized the strength of genes. Only a beautiful woman like Bai Hui could give birth to someone as handsome as Gu Zhou.

Although Bai Hui was already in her forties, she had taken good care of herself. There were no wrinkles on her face, and her skin was as white as snow. Her nose was small, and there was a red mole under the right corner of her eye.

Bai Hui was a flirtatious beauty, but the gold-rimmed glasses on her face made her look a little colder. She looked like a female elite in the workplace.

No wonder Grandma had said that Bai Hui was the number one socialite in An City back then.

At that time, countless elites of the wealthy families had used all their strength, hoping to see Bai Hui.

Bai Hui was worth it because she had a devastatingly beautiful face.

Yu Chu had been following Bai Hui. Seeing Bai Hui’s expression, she immediately understood that she was very unhappy.

“Teacher.” Yu Chu mustered her courage, her voice still soft. “Please sit!”

Bai Hui retracted her gaze from Qiao Nian’s face and looked at Yu Chu coldly. She questioned unhappily, “I told you that only Gu Zhou is allowed to enter!”

The atmosphere in the room instantly froze and became tense.

Yu Chu recalled the attendant’s words and glanced at Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian. In a soft but firm voice, he said, “Teacher, Second Sister-in-law is very important to Brother Ah Zhou. She’s not an outsider. She…”

“Shut up!” Bai Hui’s eyes grew colder and colder. Her entire body emitted a chill as she frowned at Yu Chu.

Yu Chu’s eyes turned red with grievance. She lowered her head and stood there like a cat in the rain, looking pitiful.
