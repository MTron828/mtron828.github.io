Chapter 54: How Humiliating

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Lu Yan pursed his lips unhappily. He glanced at Gu Zhou, then got up and left reluctantly with his bag. He had wanted to hear more gossip.

After Lu Yan left the room, Gu Zhou walked back to the bed and looked down at the girl lying there.

Perhaps it was because of her fever, but her face was flushed red, and her breathing had grown shallower. She was frowning slightly, as if she were having a nightmare.

After Gu Zhou left the room, he turned and entered the study. Seeing Chen Qing enter, he asked solemnly, “Have you found any information on Qiao Nian?”

“We’ve already investigated thoroughly!” Chen Qing said with a serious expression. He handed the documents he had been holding to Gu Zhou and stepped to the side. “When Madam was born, the Qiao family sent her to live in the mountains. She was raised by Qiao Shan’s younger sister, Qiao Ling.

“When Madam was ten, Qiao Ling got into a car accident, and Madam was sent to live in a nunnery. When she turned seventeen, she got into university, and only then was she sent back to live with the Qiao family.”

Gu Zhou’s expression darkened a little. Spinning a fountain pen in his hand, he said thoughtfully, “She didn’t grow up with the Qiao family. I guess the Qiao family doesn’t know everything about her either.”

“Madam was sent to a mental hospital because she burned down a school building in university,” Chen Qing said solemnly.

“Mental? Do you think she’s mentally ill?” Gu Zhou asked in reply.

Chen Qing recalled how magnificent Qiao Nian had been when she dealt with Zheng He. He said earnestly, “No, I don’t think so. I believe that the Qiao family is slandering Madam.”

Hearing Chen Qing’s words, Gu Zhou narrowed his phoenix-like eyes. He recalled the degrading words they had spoken about Qiao Nian when he was at the Qiao family villa. Frustration flashed across his face.

Gu Zhou gripped the documents in his hand tightly. “She can control a snake without breaking a sweat. She’s definitely not as simple as an ordinary person. She must have undergone professional training. We have to investigate this matter thoroughly.”

Chen Qing drew a sharp breath. Now, he understood why the Second Young Master had chosen not to stand up for Qiao Nian directly when others were bullying her at the banquet.

Now, it seemed that it was already quite fortunate for them that Madam had chosen not to retaliate.

Gu Zhou looked at the documents in his hand. They contained no additional useful information. He looked up at Chen Qing and continued, “Continue your investigation!”

“Yes, sir.”

After Chen Qing left, Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on the documents. His brow furrowed deeper and deeper.

Was Qiao Nian’s marriage into his family a mere coincidence, or did she have other motives?

He didn’t know if he should believe Qiao Nian.

The only thing he was certain of right now was that Qiao Nian’s medical skills were excellent. She seemed to be truly capable of treating his illness.

But Gu Zhou didn’t dare to take the risk. He was afraid that Qiao Nian had been sent here by those people. If his gamble failed, there would be no coming back from that mistake.

The next morning, sunlight filtered through the windows, slanting across the bed.

Qiao Nian opened her eyes dazedly. The sun was a little glaring, and she burrowed under the blankets.

She was so thirsty.

Qiao Nian sat up reluctantly. Just as she was about to get out of bed, she heard a familiar voice.

“You’re awake. Are you feeling better?” Sitting on the sofa, Gu Zhou put down the documents in his hand and looked at Qiao Nian intently. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The man’s voice was low and slightly rough, and was as pleasant to the ear as ever.

Qiao Nian froze for a moment. Only then did she remember what had happened last night. She seemed to have fallen asleep in the bathtub, but she wasn’t aware of anything that had happened from then on.

However, she seemed to remember practically throwing herself at Gu Zhou.

This was simply too humiliating!

Her illustrious reputation had been ruined just like that!

The next time she met Shen Xing, she would never let her off.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou suspiciously. Seeing that he was wearing a bathrobe, her brow furrowed deeper and deeper.

“I’m much better.” Confusion was written all over Qiao Nian’s pretty face. She hesitated, caught in a dilemma over whether to ask Gu Zhou about what had happened last night.

“Qiao Xin gave you a call.” Gu Zhou glanced at the phone beside Qiao Nian’s pillow.

Qiao Xin had actually dared to call her.. It seemed that Qiao Xin was becoming much bolder.
