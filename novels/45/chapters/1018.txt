1019 Glutinous Ball

Song Yu knew that Auntie Cao had always been straightforward, but at a time like this, she shouldn’t have said these words.

“Auntie Cao, you’re thinking too much. Big Brother brought Sister home, which means that there’s no doubt about her identity. Moreover, Big Brother and the others have evidence to prove that she’s Sister.” Song Yu said with a smile, “Auntie Cao, Ah Qi said that she wants to eat glutinous rice balls today. I want to eat them too. Auntie Cao, I’ll go make glutinous rice balls with you!”

Qiao Nian looked at Song Yu. Song Yu’s words were pleasant to the ear. Not only did she save Auntie Cao from her rash actions, but she also gave her an out. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Song Yu addressed her as “Sister”, which meant that she had directly acknowledged her identity.

!!

Qiao Nian shifted her gaze to Auntie Cao.

Auntie Cao’s gaze was sharp, as if she wanted to see if she was really the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

“Glutinous rice balls are great.” Matriarch Lu’s expression improved a lot. Only then did she say, “Today is our reunion. Auntie Cao, we’ll eat glutinous rice balls today!”

When Auntie Cao heard Matriarch Lu’s words, she retracted her gaze and said respectfully, “Matriarch Lu, don’t blame me for thinking too much about this. If I remember correctly, we found Eldest Miss’s broken arm back then, but Miss Qiao Nian’s arm was intact.”

Matriarch Lu looked at Qiao Nian. Although she didn’t know what had happened to the broken arm back then, she was certain that Qiao Nian was her eldest granddaughter, Sugar!

Seeing that Auntie Cao was still arguing logically, Matriarch Lu’s voice turned cold. “Alright, go prepare the glutinous rice balls now. Don’t ask anything else!”

Auntie Cao did not let go of her doubts because of Matriarch Lu’s words. She continued, “I was just thinking that since there’s evidence, we should show it to everyone.”

When Qiao Nian heard Auntie Cao’s words, a trace of surprise flashed in her eyes. She didn’t understand what status Auntie Cao had in the Lu family.

Moreover, when Auntie Cao raised her doubts, only her eldest brother had dissatisfaction written on his face. As for her other brothers, only their eyes revealed some dissatisfaction.

When Matriarch Lu heard Auntie Cao’s words, her frown deepened. She knew that Auntie Cao’s doubts were reasonable, but she was unwilling to admit it.

Even if Qiao Nian wasn’t the real Sugar, she felt that if Sugar grew up, she would look a lot like Qiao Nian.

Matriarch Lu was very afraid.

Song Yu had been following Matriarch Lu the entire time, so she could naturally tell that Matriarch Lu was afraid. She walked to Matriarch Lu’s side and held her arm. “Grandma, I believe in Big Brother. He must be right.”

When Matriarch Lu heard Song Yu’s words, her heart, which had been in her throat, instantly relaxed. She heaved a sigh of relief.

Song Yu comforted Matriarch Lu and walked over to Auntie Cao. She reached out and took Auntie Cao’s arm, saying gently, “Auntie Cao, it’s getting late. I’m a little hungry. Let’s go cook glutinous rice balls!”

Auntie Cao smiled at Song Yu, then stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian and said, “Since you said that Miss Qiao Nian is the eldest daughter, show me the evidence. I want to see the evidence with my own eyes. Otherwise, I might think that you have ulterior motives!”

As soon as Auntie Cao said this, everyone’s expressions changed.

Gu Zhou narrowed his phoenix-like eyes and looked at Auntie Cao coldly. His eyes were filled with ink, and there was a hint of coldness in his voice as he questioned, “Do you mean that we’ll hurt you?”

Gu Zhou’s tone was very cold, like a cold blade pressed against Auntie Cao’s neck.

He was like a majestic and arrogant lion, exuding a domineering aura. He did his best to protect Qiao Nian, not allowing anyone to hurt her.

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, her eyes were filled with laughter, and her lips curved up slightly.

Just now, Gu Zhou had not spoken. She had forgotten that Gu Zhou had followed her over.

Lu Qi, who was standing at the side, saw Gu Zhou protecting Qiao Nian. Her lips curved up slightly, and her eyes were filled with laughter.

This brother-in-law was not bad. He was worthy of his sister!

What a pity. If only her sister wasn’t married yet. Then she could spend more time with her sister.

But now, his sister was with Brother Ah Zhou every day.
