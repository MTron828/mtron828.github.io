1181 Lost!

He walked to Widow Wang’s door and knocked. He was overjoyed, thinking that Little Lu Nian would open the door for him. The door opened. When he told Widow Wang about his visit, she said something that he found hard to accept.

Thank you readers!

“I didn’t see a young lady at my door.”

Oh my god, Little Lu Nian was actually lost!

It turned out that Widow Wang was a little deaf. When he sent Little Lu Nian over that day, Widow Wang was drying clothes in the courtyard. She didn’t hear his knock at all.

This era was still relatively backward. There were not many cameras on the streets. It was really too difficult to find a child in the vast crowd.

Every day, he watched as Su Yan suffered so much that she wanted to die. He was also sad, but he couldn’t tell the truth. Not only did he not see his daughter, but he also became that woman’s pawn.

The saddest thing was that he didn’t even know if his daughter was alive or dead.

When Shen An realized that his memory was getting worse and worse, he went to look for a doctor. The doctor said that he had been poisoned. The doctor didn’t know what poison it was, nor did he know how to help him detoxify it.

Shen An announced to the public that he had Alzheimer’s. He knew very well that it was that woman who had poisoned him.

He couldn’t settle scores with that woman regarding his lost daughter. Moreover, that woman had disappeared without a trace.

He had always thought that when Little Lu Nian returned, he would be able to tell Su Yan everything. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

However, he never found Little Lu Nian, nor did she return.

That woman seemed to have disappeared, but he felt that there was still that person’s spy beside him.

Later on, he heard from others that Su Yan had gone overseas sadly. He didn’t know if he would have a chance to tell Su Yan the truth in his life.

Hence, he had recorded this video in advance, thinking that if he had the chance in the future, he would give the USB drive to Su Yan.

After the video ended, everyone fell silent.

Su Yan looked at the video with red-rimmed eyes. Her voice was choked with emotion. “Which woman would do such a crazy thing!”

Lu You comforted Su Yan and frowned. He said, “Looks like that woman should be beside us. To be able to get Sugar’s intravenous blood, she must be someone familiar.”

Qiao Nian recalled what was written in Jiang Cheng’s diary. With a serious expression, she said, “From what Dr. Shen said and the diary in Jiang Cheng, that woman herself, her spies are in the Lu family, or someone close to the Lu family has drawn my blood. Therefore, we can’t bring Dr. Shen back to the Lu family.”

Lu Zhu said with a dark expression, “I really didn’t expect there to be a traitor in our family. Looks like we have to clean up the family well!”

Su Yan’s eyes were red. She wiped her tears with a tissue. “I’ll also investigate those who don’t have a good relationship with our family.”

Su Yan had just finished speaking when Shen An’s voice came from the side.

“Where are we?”

Everyone’s gaze fell on Shen An’s face. Under the gaze of so many people, Shen An silently shrank back.

“Teacher.” Su Yan stood up and walked to Shen An’s side, calling out softly.

“Who are you? I don’t know you!” Shen An silently moved to the side and glanced around. “This isn’t my room. I want to go back!”

“Teacher, I’m Su Yan!”

When Shen An heard Su Yan’s words, his emotions stabilized. He moved closer to Su Yan and took a closer look. With a serious expression, he said, “Hurry up and go to the Su family village to save Sugar!”

As Shen An spoke, he glanced around. His gaze fell on the coffee table and the Rubik’s Cube. He immediately opened the Rubik’s Cube and saw that it was empty. “No, there should be something inside. I want to give it to you!”

Su Yan handed her hand to Shen An. There was a USB flash drive in her palm. She asked, “Teacher, do you want to give this to me?”

“Yes, yes, yes. Hurry up and look at it! Don’t let anyone else see it!” Shen An instructed seriously. “Save Sugar! Hurry!”
