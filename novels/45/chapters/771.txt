Qiao Nian knew in her heart that perhaps these words might be a little profound to other children, but Xiao Shi was a smart child. She believed that Xiao Shi could understand her words.

Xiao Shi lowered her head, her long eyelashes drooping. Her throat felt a little uncomfortable, and her eyes were so hot that they seemed to be on the verge of tears.

The last time she had such a feeling was when she realized that her mommy was secretly crying at night. Only then did she know that her mommy was also in pain!

Hence, she worked even harder to earn money to support herself and her mommy.

But she still didn’t see her mommy happy.

There was another red light ahead. Qiao Nian stopped the car. Looking at Xiao Shi’s downcast expression, she gently rubbed his head and said gently, “Xiao Shi, in the future, be a simple child. Don’t give yourself any pressure. If you want to laugh, laugh. If you want to cry, cry! Everyone likes you very much and will dote on you. You’ll be very happy in the future!”

When Qiao Nian finished speaking, she vaguely recalled what her brother had told her previously. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

In the past, she had been very touched by what her brother had said to her, but now, she suddenly understood his good intentions!

Big Brother hoped that she would be happier and not be restrained by other things.

But she now hoped that Xiao Shi would also become happier. In other words, she already treated Xiao Shi as her family.

When she realized this, Qiao Nian was slightly stunned.

Could it be that she was too lonely? When she met someone who had experienced the same thing as her, she couldn’t help but want her to be happy.

Or was it because she missed her child?

Her poor child had already left this world before she could even take a look at this world.

If only they were still here.

That way, she wouldn’t feel lonely.

“Auntie Nian Nian, thank you for telling me this. I understand!” Xiao Shi smiled brightly and said gratefully.

When Qiao Nian heard Xiao Shi’s words, she retracted her thoughts and smiled. “Be good!”

Her heart skipped a beat involuntarily, then beat faster and faster.

For some reason, she especially liked to listen to Auntie Nian Nian speak.

Auntie Nian Nian was really very gentle. When she was with Auntie Nian Nian, she felt at ease. She couldn’t help but want to be with Auntie Nian Nian more.

She wanted to live with Auntie Nian Nian for the rest of her life. She felt that if she stayed by Auntie Nian Nian’s side, she would definitely be able to live very happily, just as Auntie Nian Nian had said.

What puzzled her the most was that she had never felt so at ease when she was with her mommy.

Could it be that Mommy had been sick in bed and could not protect her all the time?

Moreover, what Mommy taught her was completely different from what Auntie Nian Nian had taught her.

Mommy had always said that everyone in this world only liked obedient children, and only pitiful children. If she pretended to be pitiful, others would feel sorry for her.

Although she didn’t like to pretend to be pitiful, Mommy would be angry if she didn’t.

Auntie Nian Nian was teaching her to be herself freely and not think too much about the feelings of others.

She liked the feeling Auntie Nian Nian was talking about very much. She also wanted to become the kind of person Auntie Nian Nian was talking about.

She knew in her heart that she would be happier this way.

Just as she was thinking about whether he should listen to Auntie Nian Nian or her mommy, the car stopped.

Xiao Shi panicked.

She was going to see her daddy now.

She wondered if her father would like her.

“Don’t worry, your daddy will definitely like you very much!” Qiao Nian smiled gently at Xiao Shi and gently patted his head. “You just have to be yourself!”

Her heart began to race.

Qiao Nian helped Xiao Shi unbuckle her seatbelt. She got out of the car first, then walked to the front passenger door and opened it.

Qiao Nian handed her hand to Xiao Shi. “Get out of the car!”

Xiao Shi’s gaze fell on Qiao Ning’s hands. Her hands were fair and delicate, and her fingers were long.
