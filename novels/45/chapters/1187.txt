1188 Silly

Qiao Nian fell into deep thought. If Mr. Chen didn’t give Jiang Chi face, how could they meet him?

Thank you readers!

Gu Zhou held Qiao Nian’s hand tightly and said in a low voice, “As everyone knows, Mr. Chen likes to gamble on stones. If there’s a huge stone gambling banquet, he’ll very likely come.”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou beside her. From Mr. Chen’s preferences, it was indeed possible to invite him over.

“That’s indeed a good idea,” Qiao Nian echoed. However, a banquet wasn’t that easy to organize. She looked at Gu Zhou beside her. “But it’ll take a lot of time to prepare a lot of raw stones, as well as the venue. I’m afraid it’ll take a lot of time to send an invitation.”

“You don’t have to worry about that. I’ve already spoken to your fourth brother. He arrived earlier than us and has already begun to prepare things,” Gu Zhou said.

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she was shocked. She asked in surprise, “Did you say Fourth Brother?”

“Yes.” Gu Zhou raised his eyebrows slightly and continued, “You might not know this, but not only is your Fourth Brother the chairman of a bank, but he’s also famous in the stone gambling world.”

“Could it be the last banker who obtained imperial jade?” Qiao Nian asked tentatively.

The last time she came here to participate in stone gambling, she had obtained imperial jade, which resounded throughout the stone gambling world.

From then on, people in the stone gambling world seemed to call her the queen of stone gambling.

At that time, she had heard from others that someone had opened an imperial jade. Although that person had spent a lot of money, the imperial jade was very big and he had profited a lot. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Gu Zhou nodded in agreement and said, “That’s right. That person is your brother.”

Qiao Nian was speechless.

Qiao Nian really hadn’t expected her fourth brother, who looked gentle and refined, to be so wise and decisive. However, she could tell that the stone gambling competition had almost cost her money.

If she hadn’t gotten that cheap imperial jade, no one would have dared to say that her fourth brother was silly!

Qiao Nian retracted her thoughts and looked at Gu Zhou. She asked curiously, “Have you already thought of how to meet Mr. Chen?”

“I’m making sufficient preparations in case of emergencies.” With that, Gu Zhou looked at Jiang Chi beside him. “My men found out that the last call to Jiang Cheng’s cell phone was from him. He took the initiative to call Mr. Chen, but I’m not sure if the two of them have met.”

Jiang Chi was slightly stunned. He had not expected Gu Zhou to help investigate the cause of his brother’s death.

From this, it could be seen that the person who killed his brother back then was definitely not simple. So many of them were investigating this matter. It had been two years, but they had found very few clues.

Jiang Chi nodded and said nothing.

In Gu Zhou’s opinion, the culprit was the same person responsible for Qiao Nian’s kidnapping more than twenty years ago and the cause of Jiang Cheng’s death. No matter how one investigated, as long as they could find the culprit, it would be fine.

However, he had never expected to find out more information from Mr. Chen.

The truth was getting more and more confusing.

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian had rushed here from An City and were a little tired. They said to Jiang Chi, “Let’s rest first. We’ll talk about the rest later!”

With that, Gu Zhou held Qiao Nian’s hand tightly and pulled her forward quickly, leaving Jiang Chi behind.

Jiang Chi’s gaze fell on Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian’s interlocked hands. His eyes darkened, and the aura around him turned colder.

Qiao Nian walked in front and could feel Jiang Chi’s displeased gaze on her from behind. She frowned slightly.

Could it be that Jiang Chi had yet to give up?

Qiao Nian didn’t turn around. She followed Gu Zhou to the MY Hotel.

This hotel was also a hotel under the HH Corporation and was under Mr. Chen’s jurisdiction.

As soon as she got out of the car, Qiao Nian saw Fourth Brother standing far away from the door. She immediately jogged over and greeted “Fourth Brother.”

Lu Jiang’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. He sized her up carefully, a warm smile in his eyes. “Are you tired from the plane ride?”

“I’m fine. Have you been waiting for us for a long time?” Qiao Nian smiled at Lu Jiang.

“You arrived as soon as I came out!”

As soon as Lu Jiang finished speaking, Allen walked over. When he saw Qiao Nian, he greeted politely, “Eldest Miss.”
