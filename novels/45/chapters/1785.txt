Chapter 1786 - 1786 Traitor!

Seeing this, Gu Zhou hurriedly turned on the recording button again. This was evidence of Mark’s rebellion.

At this moment, gunshots came from outside, followed by screams.

“Ah, there’s a traitor!”

“How did the president’s men get in?”

Mark listened to the voices and frowned. He looked over and saw that the others were already in a mess.

It was strange. The only people who could enter were him and Cui Huai’s people. How could there be the president’s people?

This couldn’t be happening!

Mark frowned and looked at Cui Huai not far away with a dark expression, as if he was asking Cui Huai what had happened.

Cui Huai also looked at Mark in shock and frowned. He did not know what had happened.

Chen Sheng had been standing beside Cui Huai and said in a low voice, “Boss, there seems to be a mole in our team!”

When Cui Huai heard Chen Sheng’s words, his expression darkened. His eyes were filled with anger, and his entire body exuded a cold aura. “I’ve always been very careful. My team is filled with my people. Moreover, after coming to Europe, I’ve seen everyone who came in with my own eyes. They’re all people I know. There’s no stranger at all.”

Cui Huai did not understand how the mole had sneaked in.

The event location was in a mess. Gunshots were fired non-stop, and the floor was already covered in blood.

After the bullets were used up, many people chose to use cold weapons. They took out the knives in their hands and stabbed the other party mercilessly.

Sha He’s eyes instantly lit up when he saw the situation at the event location. He liked to kill, so he couldn’t help but join in. He killed everyone he saw and completely forgot to protect Cui Huai.

Chen Sheng had been protecting Cui Huai. When he saw someone rushing over, he threw a punch at that person and said, “Boss, those mole might have sneaked in when we were in MY!”

Hearing Chen Sheng’s words, Cui Huai’s gaze landed on Sha He.

He no longer suspected Chen Sheng at all, because Chen Sheng had been protecting him. Instead, Sha He, who rushed straight into the crowd, was more like a mole.

Cui Huai responded coldly and said, “Looks like we have to settle the score when we get back.”

What Cui Huai was most worried about now was that not only had he failed to help Mark handle everything, but he had also put Mark in a difficult situation. He also became irritable. He took out his gun and killed a person without hesitation. Then, he took out his knife and stabbed the heart of an unlucky person who rushed over.

He suddenly pulled out the knife. Blood splashed all over his face. He was covered in blood, as if he was a demon that had crawled out of hell.

Chen Sheng killed three people who came over.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

After Chen Sheng finished dealing with the matters here, he leaned against Cui Huai with a calm expression and said, “Boss, we can’t stay here any longer. We don’t know when those people will attack us. Let’s hurry up and look for the President.”

Hearing the word “President”, Cui Huai’s eyes were filled with anger. Through the crowd in the chaotic battle, his gaze landed on the president’s face not far away. He gritted his teeth and said, “Okay!”

Cui Huai looked at Chen Sheng beside him. The person he was most afraid of was Chen Sheng, but he never expected that the person who could help him fulfill his wish was actually Chen Sheng.

At this moment, there were many people around the president. The president’s guards blocked him from outsiders.

Mark didn’t think about killing the president directly. Instead, he wanted to force the president to sign a contract to pass the throne to him.

When the time came, Mark could say that he had a good relationship with the president. They were originally brothers and now that their children were married, they were even closer. The president was not feeling well as that was why he pased the throne to him.

Gu Zhou watched as those people rushed up recklessly and he kicked one of them away. With a knife in his hand, he looked coldly at everyone who was approaching them.

More and more people surrounded the president. Previously, those people had already received orders from the higher-ups who said they would give 30 million yuan to anyone who could control Mark.

Ordinary people did not even dare to think about 30 million yuan, so at this moment, they were all rushing towards the president.
