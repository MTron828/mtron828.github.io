Chapter 1767 - 1767 Protect Him

As Lina thought about this, she asked directly, “Where’s Nian Nian?”

“Second Young Madam went to answer the phone.” Chen Qing felt that with Second Young Madam’s expression just now, it was very likely that the call was from Eldest Young Master. He just didn’t know if things would go smoothly. He glanced at Wright beside him. This wasn’t a place to talk, so he couldn’t say much. “Where’s his room? I’ll send him there.”

Lina looked at Wright. His eyes were tightly shut, as if he had fallen asleep. There was no movement at all, so she said, “I’ll take you there.”

Chen Qing helped Wright follow behind Lina. When they reached Wright’s bedroom, Chen Qing placed Wright on the bed. His movements were rough and not light at all.

At this moment, Wright opened his eyes.

Lina’s heart skipped a beat. Could it be that Chen Qing’s movements were heavier just now and directly woke Wright up?

With Wright’s irritable temper, he would definitely find trouble with Chen Qing again.

With that thought in mind, Lina grabbed Chen Qing’s hand and pulled him behind her.

Chen Qing looked down at Lina’s hand that was holding his. His eyes paused as he stared intently at Lina’s back with a smile in his eyes.

“Wright, about this…” Before Lina could finish, she saw Wright lying there expressionlessly. His eyes were empty as he looked at the ceiling. He blinked slowly, looking like a dummy.

Lina frowned and let go of Chen Qing’s hand.

Chen Qing sensed Lina’s movements, and felt a little empty.

However, Lina’s attention was on Wright. She looked at Chen Qing behind her in confusion and asked, “What’s wrong with Wright? He looks a little abnormal? Has he…”

In the end, Lina was too embarrassed to say the words “gone stupid”.

Chen Qing glanced at Wright on the bed. His expression was indifferent, and his tone was cold. “Actually, it’s nothing. Second young madam treated him previously and only made him look like a normal person. As for his…”

Chen Qing recalled that when he went to the water prison previously, Wright was standing in the water prison like a fool with a silly smile.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Second young madam really didn’t like Wright’s silly smile, so she simply helped him treat all his external injuries, but she didn’t let him smile foolishly. As for Wright’s brain, Second young madam felt that a harmless Wright was more pleasing to the eye.

“He’s been in the water prison for the past few days. His mind seems to have left home,” Chen Qing said.

Lina’s eyes widened slightly, then she smiled and said, “Actually, this is good too. Wright is living well now, but he can’t do anything messy, let alone hurt you again.”

Chen Qing’s gaze moved from Wright’s face to Lina’s. He recalled that when Wright opened his eyes just now, Lina pulled him behind her without hesitation. The corners of his lips curled up imperceptibly, and his voice was a little low. “Seventh Princess, are you very worried about me?”

When Lina heard Chen Qing’s words, her heart involuntarily beat faster. She turned around and saw Chen Qing staring at her intently.

At this moment, Lina realized that the two of them were very close. This distance made her heart beat violently.

She looked at Chen Qing and noticed the heat in his eyes. She tilted her head slightly to the side and thought about how to lie.

“When Wright woke up just now.” This time, Chen Qing took the initiative to ask seriously, “You were afraid that I would be hurt, so you stood in front of me and wanted to protect me?”

Lina’s face turned redder and redder. She staggered back a step and tried to keep her distance from Chen Qing.

On the night of the engagement banquet, she already knew Chen Qing’s love for her, but it was too late.

Their statuses were worlds apart. She was now a knife in her father’s hand. As long as her father gave the order, she would fight for her father’s victory.
