Chapter 191: Qiao Yu Has Arrived

When Su Xue heard Qiao Nian’s words, she grew more and more anxious. In a panic, she roared, “How can you say that? That’s not what you said just now!”

Qiao Nian looked at Su Xue coldly. “I made myself very clear just now. If you had told me who my biological parents were, I wouldn’t have called the police, but did you? No! Instead, you spouted a pile of useless nonsense!”

With that, Qiao Nian picked up the call and placed the phone to her ear. She said politely, “Hello, Officer. Yes, they’re all here. Room 2009!”

With that, Qiao Nian hung up calmly.

All the strength in Su Xue’s body seemed to have been drained. She collapsed onto the bed, her face ashen.

At this moment, the door was pushed open from the outside.

When they heard the door open, everyone thought that the police had arrived.

Su Xue shivered in fear, burrowing under the blanket.

“Dad.”

A cold voice rang from the door.

Everyone turned to look.

It was Qiao Yu!

Qiao Yu was wearing a black suit and a turquoise tie, making him look a little younger than usual. He strode in, exuding a cold aura.

Qiao Nian’s expression didn’t change, but she had a bad feeling about this.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Yu expressionlessly, his thin lips pursed into a pale line. Previously, during the speech, Qiao Nian had looked at Qiao Yu with the same expression.

In a flash, Gu Zhou suddenly grasped the key point.

Did Qiao Yu already know that he wasn’t related to Qiao Nian by blood?

Su Xue poked her head out of the blanket. Her tears began to fall uncontrollably. She had never expected her son to arrive as well, and her sense of humiliation only intensified. She spoke shakily, “Qiao…”

Before Su Xue could finish her sentence, she met Qiao Yu’s cold and furious gaze. In an instant, she was so terrified that she no longer dared to speak.

Su Xue lowered her gaze, her tears falling silently.

When Qiao Xin saw that Qiao Yu had arrived, she seemed to have found her pillar of support. She ran over, sobbing pitifully. Her voice was choked as she spoke. “Brother…”

When Qiao Yu saw Qiao Xin, his gaze softened. He gently patted Qiao Xin’s head, comforting her. “Xin Xin, don’t cry. Be good. Don’t worry, I can handle this.”

When Qiao Xin heard Qiao Yu’s words, her uneasy heart finally calmed down. She stood obediently next to Qiao Yu.

Qiao Yu took a good look at Qiao Nian, sizing her up with a brazen gaze. His voice was low and hoarse, tinged with anger. “Looks like you’ve really grown up. You’re capable now.”

Qiao Nian met Qiao Yu’s gaze fearlessly, her expression calm. “The police will be here in a few minutes. How are you planning to save her?”

“Why should I save her?” Qiao Yu looked down condescendingly at Qiao Nian, his voice as cold as ice.

When Qiao Nian heard Qiao Yu’s words, she was slightly stunned. She had thought that Qiao Yu had rushed over anxiously to save Su Xue.

However, she had guessed wrong.

Then why had Qiao Yu come?

When Su Xue heard Qiao Yu’s words, she had a bad feeling. She said blankly, “Qiao Yu, you…”

Qiao Yu didn’t even bother granting Su Xue a glance. His voice was tinged with impatience. “Shut up!”

Su Xue’s thin body trembled slightly. She looked at Qiao Yu in despair.

That made sense. She had brought shame and dishonor to the family. Her son was right to blame her.

Qiao Xin looked at Qiao Yu uneasily. The police were about to arrive.

Did her brother really want her mother to go to jail?

Qiao Shan, who was standing at the side, looked at Qiao Yu with satisfaction. Qiao Yu had been working in the outside world for a long time, and had become much more mature. With Qiao Yu as the head of the Qiao family in the future, Qiao Shan would no longer have to worry.

Moreover, Qiao Shan had a feeling that if Qiao Yu were to interfere in this matter, there would definitely be room for negotiation.

Qiao Yu stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian. His tone was much calmer than before as he asked, “Do you know why I didn’t attend this family meeting?”

Qiao Nian looked at Qiao Yu calmly, waiting for him to continue.
