Chapter 201: Thank You Gift?

When Gu Zhou heard this, his eyes darkened.

Seeing Gu Zhou’s reaction, Qiao Nian knew in her heart that he definitely hadn’t realized that she had taken his money.

However, Qiao Nian was curious about why Gu Zhou was so concerned about this matter. Most of the time, Gu Zhou didn’t seem to care about anything. “What’s wrong? Do you have something to ask her?”

Gu Zhou looked up. Seeing Qiao Nian’s serious expression, he pursed his thin lips.

Hackers were not all-powerful.

Moreover, that incident had happened five years ago. Even if Mr. K made a move, she might not be able to investigate the situation back then. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Also, he didn’t want Qiao Nian to know what happened five years ago.

“It’s nothing,” Gu Zhou said impassively.

Qiao Nian studied Gu Zhou’s expression. He looked exactly the same as he always had. It was as if the serious expression she had glimpsed just now was just an illusion. She smiled. The money that had entered her pocket was hers. He could forget about getting it back.

Qiao Nian said happily, “Fortunately, you accompanied me to the hotel today. If it weren’t for you, I might have wasted a trip there. Thank you.”

Gu Zhou looked into Qiao Nian’s sparkling eyes and frowned slightly. There was a trace of dissatisfaction in his voice as he said, “Is a thank you all I get? Surely that’s too perfunctory?”

The smile on Qiao Nian’s face froze.

Hadn’t Gu Zhou gotten angry with her because she had thanked him previously? Why was he saying that her expression of gratitude was too perfunctory now?

A man’s thought processes were as clear as mud!

Truly incomprehensible.

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on the blessing bag beside Qiao Nian. He instantly understood. So she was thanking him by making a blessing bag for him.

Although he didn’t like to wear such things, since she was making one for him by hand, he’d have no choice but to wear it then.

While Qiao Nian was still puzzled, Gu Zhou stood up and said calmly, “I like the aroma of ambergris.”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion. It was as though there were a dozen question marks around her head.

Qiao Nian had always thought that she was very smart, but at this moment, she felt that she might be a little unintelligent. She didn’t understand Gu Zhou’s words at all.

Was Gu Zhou just telling her his preferences so that she would remember them?

Puzzled, Qiao Nian nodded.

Under her astonished gaze, Gu Zhou left the bedroom.

Qiao Nian walked to the door and closed it. She was about to continue embroidering the blessing bag when she seemed to remember something. She took out her phone and made a call.

“Oh, my dear young lady, you finally have the time to call me!”

Qiao Nian couldn’t be bothered to be polite. She said directly, “Go and help me buy a box of high-quality ambergris. The price is negotiable. The quality must be good.”

“Sure.”

Qiao Nian thought of the scene of Qiao Shan and Su Xue being taken away by the police. Her eyes narrowed slightly as she continued, “I have another important task for you.”

“What is it?”

Qiao Nian’s lips curved up slightly as she said, “Purchase all the shares of the medical enterprises under the Qiao corporation under my name. Make use of the fact that I’m a shareholder of the Qiao Corporation.”

“Are you going to attack the Qiao family now? Aren’t you going to wait?”

Qiao Nian recalled the way Qiao Yu had stared at her, like a snake staring at its prey. She didn’t like Qiao Yu’s gaze at all. She had to get rid of the Qiao family as soon as possible, so that they wouldn’t be able to cause any trouble.

However, Qiao Nian wouldn’t tell them this. She said casually, “I just think that the shares I have aren’t enough. Now is the best time to buy them.”

Because Qiao Yu would definitely be too busy right now.

Qiao Shan had committed the crime of intentional injury, and Su Xue had perjured herself. Qiao Yu would definitely be busy fishing Qiao Shan and Su Xue out!

“Understood. I’ll get it done right away!”

Satisfied, Qiao Nian hung up. Only then did she pick up the blessing bag and continue embroidering, her expression indifferent.

While Qiao Nian was making the blessing bag, she suddenly recalled Gu Zhou’s words. She thought that it wouldn’t be a bad idea to store ambergris within the blessing bag.

She would definitely make a good-looking blessing bag for Gu Zhou.
