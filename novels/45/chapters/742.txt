743 Obtaining Evidence

She had never told Gu Zhou about this.

She had asked Gu Zhou to hide nothing from her, but she had hidden a lot from Gu Zhou.

She couldn’t even be honest with herself, so how could she ask Gu Zhou to treat her like this?

If she and Gu Zhou were truly husband and wife, she would definitely ask Gu Zhou to be loyal to her and not hide anything from her.

Of course, she would also tell Gu Zhou everything that had happened to her.

However, she was not ready to be honest with Gu Zhou yet.

It seemed that Gu Zhou was not ready either.

The current Gu Zhou liked her, but not deeply. Perhaps it was because she was the doctor who understood his condition the best that Gu Zhou treated her differently.

Even if they didn’t talk about their relationship, she had to figure out Gu Qi’s identity.

Although Gu Qi was not her child, she sincerely treated him as her own.

After thinking everything through, Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou with a smile and said, “You’re right. Each of us has our own secrets. I think Jiang Yue is indeed trying to sow discord between us.”

At that time, Gu Zhou’s lips were tightly pursed as he stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian, as if he was considering what Qiao Nian had said. After a long time, he said, “Is that really what you think?”

Qiao Nian nodded obediently.

“If…” Gu Zhou hesitated for a moment, his dark eyes darkening. “If there’s something I haven’t told you, what will you do?”

Seeing Gu Zhou’s expression, Qiao Nian roughly understood what he was saying. She smiled gently. “You just told me not to trust anyone. Everyone has secrets, right?”

Gu Zhou looked into Qiao Nian’s eyes with a serious expression. His brow furrowed deeper and deeper, and his voice was low and hoarse. “But…”

Gu Zhou looked into Qiao Nian’s eyes with a serious expression. His brow furrowed deeper and deeper, and his voice was low and hoarse. “But…”

Gu Zhou looked into Qiao Nian’s eyes with a serious expression. His brow furrowed deeper and deeper, and his voice was low and hoarse. “But…”

As Qiao Nian drove, her mind was filled with the paternity test report Jiang Yue had given her.

Although she felt that this was Gu Zhou’s private matter, she felt a little uneasy.

Was she a third party?

If she was a third party, wouldn’t she be interfering in the relationship between Gu Zhou and Gu Qi’s mother?

At this moment, Qiao Nian recalled Gu Zhou’s words.

Gu Zhou had said that Gu Qi’s mother had disappeared and that she couldn’t be found no matter what.

Qiao Nian frowned. Had Gu Qi’s mother left on her own?

Qiao Nian was filled with confusion. When she arrived at the paternity test center, she handed the item in her hand to Doctor Li and asked him to compare this sample with Gu Qi’s.

At this moment, in the Gu family villa.

Gu Zhou received a call from Chen Qing.

“Second Young Master, Second Young Madam drove straight to the paternity test center.”

Gu Zhou sat in front of the desk, his hand tapping lightly on the table. He couldn’t help but recall the night he had been schemed against five years ago.

He recalled Qiao Nian’s gaze when she left just now.

Gu Zhou sighed slightly and said, “I understand. Come back!”

At this moment, Qiao Nian was sitting uneasily on a chair, waiting for the results of the paternity test.

As she was especially close to Doctor Li, she could get the results of the paternity test early.

After a while, Doctor Li handed the report to Qiao Nian. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“The owner of this hair is Gu Qi’s father!” Doctor Li said calmly.

Although Qiao Nian already knew the answer, her expression still changed when she saw the report with her own eyes.

Qiao Nian nodded and thanked him. Just as she was about to leave, she turned to look at Doctor Li and said, “By the way, you don’t have to help me find my family anymore!”

Doctor Li’s eyes lit up. “Have you found your family?”

Qiao Nian smiled and nodded. At the thought that her three brothers were all very gentle with her, her lips curved up involuntarily.
