Seeing that Qiao Nian was still glaring at her, Song Man said expressionlessly, “Miss Qiao, this is our own family matter. It has nothing to do with you. Please don’t…”

Bam!

Qiao Nian raised her hand and slapped Song Man’s face, interrupting her.

Song Man was stunned.

!!

She covered her face with her hand and looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief.

At this moment, Gu Qi was also stunned. His eyes widened as he muttered, “Auntie Nian Nian!”

Qiao Nian retracted her hand indifferently and looked at Song Man coldly. She said, “Miss Song, this is my home and my territory. You should know your limits. In my territory, no matter what your child has done wrong, you can’t hit her. You can only talk to her properly!”

Qiao Nian paused for a moment, her body growing colder and colder. She continued, “I didn’t slap you today on behalf of Xiao Shi. I just wanted to tell you that you’re not allowed to do such a thing in my house. An outsider using violence in someone else’s house is too rude!”

Song Man looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief.

What was Qiao Nian thinking?

Hitting her for this reason.

Was Qiao Nian a fool?

Without waiting for Song Man to speak, Qiao Nian turned to look at Gu Qi. She grabbed Gu Qi’s hand and said gently, “Xiao Shi, Auntie Nian will take you to apply medicine. Let’s go!”

Gu Qi nodded when he heard Qiao Nian’s words. He allowed Qiao Nian to pull him away. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Song Man watched as the two of them left. Her breathing was uniform, and she almost suffocated.

For some reason, she felt that the two of them looked like mother and daughter.

She seemed to be an extra person.

At the thought that Xiao Shi had left with someone who had hit her biological mother, Song Man’s expression turned colder and colder.

Why was this happening?

She had only been apart from her for a few days, but she was actually getting along so well with other women. Xiao Shi even contradicted her for other women.

It seemed that this little girl was going to escape from her grasp.

Song Man’s eyes gradually filled with ruthlessness. She would never allow Xiao Shi to escape from her grasp.

In the future, she would have to rely on her to enjoy wealth and glory.

Song Man knew very well that if she chased after her now, she would probably be even angrier.

She had to calm down. When Xiao Shi returned later, she would use other methods to regain her heart.

As long as Xiao Shi stood by her side, Gu Zhou would definitely marry her.

Song Man’s eyes were filled with complicated emotions. She paced back and forth in the living room, thinking about how to pull Xiao Shi back.

Qiao Nian held Gu Qi’s hand and walked out of the villa. When they were outside, she turned around and saw that Song Man hadn’t chased after her.

A trace of surprise flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes.

Why didn’t Song Man chase after her?

Did Song Man really not care about Xiao Shi at all?

The two of them had been together for more than five years. Song Man clearly knew that Xiao Shi had suffered. Why did she let Xiao Shi leave with her?

Qiao Nian didn’t understand what Song Man was thinking. Her heart ached as she looked at Gu Qi.

Gu Qi had probably not expected his biological mother to be like this.

Qiao Nian squatted down and pulled Gu Qi into her arms. She said gently, “Xiao Qi, I’m sorry for being late!”

In Qiao Nian’s arms, Gu Qi felt as if he was soaking in a hot spring. He also felt warmth and comfort.

In his fantasy, his mother’s embrace was just so warm and comfortable.

Without hesitation, Gu Qi reached out and hugged Qiao Nian’s neck. He pressed his face against hers and said softly, “Auntie Nian Nian, I’m fine. It doesn’t hurt at all!”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Qi’s comforting words, she felt a lump in her throat and tears welled up in her eyes.

She knew in her heart that Gu Qi should be the saddest one, but she didn’t understand why Gu Qi still wanted to comfort her.

She hugged Gu Qi tightly and recalled how Gu Qi had squatted alone in a corner. At that time, Gu Qi had looked extremely pitiful.

She recalled that when Gu Qi was sick, he was also missing his mother.

Gu Qi had finally found his mother, but in the end…

At this moment, Qiao Nian hoped that Song Man wasn’t their mother, because Song Man wasn’t worthy of being their mother at all.
