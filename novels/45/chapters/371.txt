Chapter 372: Genius (1)

Song Yu stood quietly at the side. She had learned how to draw in the past. Although she wasn’t talented in drawing, she could appreciate it.

Seeing that Qiao Nian was getting more absorbed in painting, Song Yu’s breathing quickened involuntarily.

She now felt that Qiao Nian was very likely to be Mr. Huang Shi.

However, if Qiao Nian was Mr. Huang Shi, then the stone wall painting she had brought was a fake…

What should she do?

She was a celebrity, and every move she made would be followed by the media. If the fact that she had brought a fake stone wall painting to the charity auction were to be exposed, this matter would definitely affect her future work.

Although she was in the limelight now, as long as this matter was exposed, she might not be able to work for a period of time. She might even have to suffer a huge loss from default.

During this period of time, there will be many outstanding female artistes who will take over.

Song Yu knew in her heart that she couldn’t stop Qiao Nian from painting now. The only thing she could do now was to minimize her losses.

Qin Lu, who was standing at the side, clenched her fists in dissatisfaction. She looked at Qiao Nian with hatred written all over her face. She finally understood why Qiao Nian was so close to Qin Chuan.

Qiao Nian was the genius painter, Mr. Huang Shi. It was said that Mr. Qin Chuan’s favorite painter was Mr. Huang Shi.

...

How could Qiao Nian be a painter?

Shouldn’t she be an ordinary person? Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

An hour and a half later.

Everyone looked at Qiao Nian’s painting, then at the stone wall painting on the stage. The place Qiao Nian had drawn was exactly the same as the one on the stage.

The only difference was the painting on the stage. It was a little old, but Qiao Nian’s painting was still very new.

Li Kun’s eyes flickered with a strange light. His love for Qiao Nian was endless. In the past, he had only admired Qiao Nian’s personality, but now, he felt that Qiao Nian was an outstanding person with self-restraint.

Qiao Nian had really given him a huge surprise!

Lu Nian crossed his arms. He wasn’t surprised that Qiao Nian had other disguises.

In his opinion, a girl who could play all his music in two days must be a genius.

Geniuses would also shine in other fields.

Lu Nian’s beautiful phoenix-like eyes curved up slightly, and he gave a doting smile.

At this moment, all the guests attending the auction were stunned!

“She’s really Mr. Huang Shi!”

“How is that possible? If she’s Mr. Huang Shi, then she was only eight or nine years old when she drew this painting. She’s still a child!”

“Oh my god, don’t remind me. I’m suffocating! An adult like me can’t compare to a child.”

“Is this the difference between a genius and an ordinary person?”

…

Those who didn’t believe Qiao Nian were already so shocked that they couldn’t speak. They expressed admiration and respect for Qiao Nian from the bottom of their hearts.

“Miss Qiao, we were in the wrong previously. We shouldn’t have been biased…”

“Miss Huang Shi, I’m really sorry. We didn’t recognize you!”

“Miss Huang Shi, you’re a genius. I want to acknowledge you as my master!”

…

Everyone was now certain that Qiao Nian was Miss Huang Shi, but they didn’t stop her from painting. They all wanted to see Miss Huang Shi’s elegance when she painted.

After another three hours, everyone was still standing at the side in high spirits, watching Qiao Nian draw.

Everyone looked at the contents of the stone wall painting and fell into deep thought. This painting brought them back to fourteen years ago. They were all recalling their youth.

Only now did everyone understand why Miss Huang Shi’s paintings were so outstanding. It was because she had handled all the details perfectly. Those details could resonate with everyone.

Qiao Nian only completed the painting at two in the morning.

After Qiao Nian finished the last stroke, she placed the brush on the inkstone at the side and gently twisted her aching arm.
