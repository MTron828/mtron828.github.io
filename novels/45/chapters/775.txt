776 Becoming Gu Qi’s Mother? Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

At the thought of Gu Qi, Matriarch Gu couldn’t help but sigh.

This was truly fate making fools of people.

Initially, Ah Zhou had an aversion to women and was very repulsed by any woman. Coupled with Gu Zhou’s poor health, she had thought that Gu Zhou would live like this for the rest of his life.

Qiao Nian appeared.

Qiao Nian’s appearance made Gu Zhou’s health improve. Seeing Gu Zhou’s face turn redder and redder, she heaved a sigh of relief.

Perhaps she was really insatiable. Now, she hoped that Gu Zhou could spend the rest of his life with Qiao Nian, and that Qiao Nian could be Gu Qi’s mother.

“Nian Nian, can you be Gu Qi’s mother?”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She hadn’t expected Matriarch Gu to say that.

Although she didn’t like children, she still liked Gu Qi and Xiao Shi.

When she saw these two children, she would think of her own children. She would also involuntarily place her love for her children on the two of them.

However, these two children were not her children after all.

Moreover, Gu Qi would be meeting his biological mother soon. Under such circumstances, she felt that Gu Qi might not be willing to let her be his mother.

Matriarch Gu looked at Qiao Nian’s thoughtful expression and didn’t say anything. She knew that this was indeed a very difficult choice.

Suddenly, an idea flashed across Matriarch Gu’s mind. She asked tentatively, “Do you already know that Xiao Qi is Ah Zhou’s child?”

Logically speaking, Qiao Nian should have been surprised when she made this request.

In the eyes of outsiders, everyone thought that Gu Qi was Gu Zhou’s adopted son.

Therefore, it didn’t matter if Qiao Nian was willing to be Gu Qi’s mother.

Qiao Nian looked up at Matriarch Gu and nodded. “Yes, he has already told me everything!”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Matriarch Gu was first surprised, then heaved a sigh of relief.

There shouldn’t be any hiding between husband and wife. The longer some things were hidden, the greater the reaction when they were exposed.

Matriarch Gu had wanted Gu Zhou to tell Qiao Nian about this as soon as possible.

When Qiao Nian found out about this, she couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief. From the looks of it, Qiao Nian wouldn’t leave just because Gu Qi was Gu Zhou’s child.

Matriarch Gu pursed her lips slightly and asked, “Then what do you think now?”

Qiao Nian looked up at Matriarch Gu and said honestly, “Grandma, actually, I haven’t thought about this carefully yet.”

The joy in Matriarch Gu’s heart gradually dissipated. She frowned slightly at Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian’s reaction didn’t seem right. Her current reaction was as if she was an outsider and didn’t care whose child Gu Qi was.

Matriarch Gu’s heart skipped a beat.

Could it be that Nian Nian hadn’t fallen for Ah Zhou yet?

At the thought of this, Matriarch Gu frowned and let out a long sigh. She looked at Qiao Nian lovingly and said, “Nian Nian, I know that you might not be able to accept this for a while. This was Ah Zhou’s fault to begin with. He shouldn’t have kept it from you and lied to you. If it were me, I’m afraid I wouldn’t be able to accept him for a while! I can understand you!”

Qiao Nian didn’t speak. She lowered her eyes slightly. To be honest, she felt that she was hiding much more than Gu Zhou was hiding from her.

In comparison, she felt that Gu Zhou was already very honest.

Matriarch Gu stole a glance at Qiao Nian. Seeing that Qiao Nian was silent, she couldn’t help but feel sad. It seemed that it was impossible for Qiao Nian to be with Ah Zhou.

The more Matriarch Gu thought about it, the sadder she became. She continued, “Last time, Xiao Qi even told me that he hoped that you could be his mother. Sigh…”

The more Matriarch Gu thought about it, the sadder she became. It seemed that their Xiao Qi would still have no mother in the future.

When Qiao Nian heard Matriarch Gu’s words, she looked up abruptly and asked seriously, “Did Xiao Qi really say that?”

Even Qiao Nian herself didn’t realize that her words were filled with surprise. She seemed to be eager to be Xiao Qi’s mother.
