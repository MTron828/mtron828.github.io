Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou gently and said, “I’ll get a hairdryer now and help you dry it.”

“Good!”

Qiao Nian stood up and walked towards the bathroom. Soon, she brought the hairdryer over and carefully dried Gu Zhou’s hair. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Gu Zhou sat there quietly, feeling a little light-headed. He enjoyed this feeling very much. It was very warm and comfortable.

After Qiao Nian dried Gu Zhou’s hair, she instructed him to change his clothes.

After changing his clothes, Gu Zhou lay lazily on the bed, allowing Qiao Nian to feed him.

Gu Zhou stared intently at Qiao Nian, the corners of his mouth curling up slightly.

It was good to have Nian Nian around.

At this thought, Gu Zhou closed his eyes in a daze and fell asleep.

Gu Zhou was feeling better, but Qiao Nian was very worried, because Gu Zhou had a fever now.

His entire body was burning hot, and his face was already red. He looked even weaker.

Seeing that Gu Zhou had fallen asleep, Qiao Nian was about to get his medicine so she got up.

Gu Zhou almost instinctively grabbed her hand. His eyes were still closed, and his voice was a little hoarse, but there was a hint of softness in it. “Nian Nian, you’re not allowed to leave!”

......

This cute little voice had a hint of dominance and fierceness.

Seeing Gu Zhou like this, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but smile.

Unexpectedly, Gu Zhou was still a little sickly.

Something was wrong.

To be precise, Zhou Zhou was a little sickly.

Qiao Nian sat back down on the edge of the bed. Looking at the sleeping Gu Zhou, she comforted him softly, “I understand. I won’t leave now. I’ll stay by your side.”

He seemed to have heard what Qiao Nian had said. He grunted in a daze and fell asleep completely.

When Qiao Nian realized that he was completely asleep, she carefully retracted her hand.

Gu Zhou’s fever was very high now. What if his brain was damaged?

Now, she could only use physical cooling.

Qiao Nian walked into the bathroom and placed a wet towel on Gu Zhou’s forehead.

Then, Qiao Nian wiped Gu Zhou’s limbs with a wet towel.

By the time Qiao Nian was done, she realized that it was getting late. The competition would begin in half an hour.

Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief when she realized that Gu Zhou’s fever had subsided a little.

After everything was done, Qiao Nian began to eat.

Before leaving, she helped Gu Zhou change his cold towel before leaving with her bag.

More than half an hour after Qiao Nian left, Gu Zhou finally woke up. He glanced at the time on the wall. It was now twenty minutes past fifteen.

Gu Zhou moved, and the towel on his forehead fell off.

It seemed that Qiao Nian had made a trip back.

He remembered that he had been taking a bath in the bathroom previously, but he couldn’t remember anything after that.

Vaguely, he seemed to have had a dream. In the dream, he seemed to have become like when he was young.

He even dreamed of Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian was no longer her usual cold self. Instead, she treated him gently and even helped him blow dry his hair.

Qiao Nian would even call him Zhou Zhou affectionately.

Qiao Nian even said something to him.

Zhou Zhou, you are yourself. You are unique in this world. If it hurts, you can say it. With me, you don’t have to restrain yourself.

Gu Zhou gulped and frowned slightly. His eyes darkened and his breathing became erratic.

He did not like this feeling in his dream and tried his best not to think about the situation in his dream.

Gu Zhou sat up and his gaze inadvertently landed on the food on the bedside table.

This meal was exactly the same as the one he had eaten in his dream.

For a moment, Gu Zhou was stunned.

At the same time, in the competition hall, everyone was seriously choosing their raw materials, hoping that they could spend the least amount of money to obtain more and better raw materials.

This level was even more intense than the previous one.
