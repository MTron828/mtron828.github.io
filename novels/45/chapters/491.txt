Qiao Nian’s words were reasonable.

She felt a little uncomfortable under Gu Zhou’s gaze. She pursed her dry lips slightly.

If it were in the past, she might not have said this, but after hearing Chen Qing talk about Gu Zhou’s previous life, she only wanted to know more about him.

“Was he a former relative of yours? Or a subordinate?”

The man’s voice was low as he continued, “Just an unimportant person!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Nian frowned slightly. She knew very well that Gu Zhou was lying to her. He just didn’t want her to know his secret.

However, now that the matter had been clarified and Gu Zhou was unwilling to tell her, it was not convenient for her to ask anymore.

Qiao Nian said, “Then I’ll go in first.”

“Yes.”

Qiao Nian walked towards the ward. She pushed open the door and turned back to look at Gu Zhou. He was leaning against the wall, seemingly deep in thought. He had no intention of entering the ward together.

Qiao Nian closed the door of the ward and looked at Chen Qing. “He doesn’t seem to be in a good mood. Do you want to go over and take a look?”

Actually, Chen Qing did not want to go at all. He wanted to refuse. If he went to Second Young Master’s side now, he would be walking into a gun.

However, since Second Young Madam had already spoken, he did not dare to disobey. He could only say, “Alright.”

When Chen Qing came out of the ward, he saw Gu Zhou standing there quietly. His expression was unfocused, and there seemed to be a layer of fog in his eyes.

Chen Qing walked over and called out carefully, “Second Young Master.”

“He’s still alive.” Gu Zhou’s gaze landed on Chen Qing’s face.

Chen Qing was slightly stunned. He did not understand what Gu Zhou was talking about. However, when he saw the complicated emotions in Gu Zhou’s eyes, he instantly reacted.

So Second Young Master was talking about Eldest Young Master.

For a moment, Chen Qing did not know how to respond.

After a long while, Chen Qing said, “Second Young Master, didn’t we already investigate when we went to save Madam previously? Although Eldest Young Master has been here and lives in the north, we found out that he has already passed away. Why do you think Eldest Young Master is still alive?”

Moreover, Chen Qing had followed Second Young Master’s instructions and sent all of Young Master’s belongings back to An City.

Gu Zhou’s gaze landed on Chen Qing’s face. His thin lips parted slightly as he asked, “Do you still remember Chang Feng?”

When Chen Qing heard Gu Zhou’s words, his expression changed slightly.

He would never forget Chang Feng. Chang Feng was a bodyguard of the Gu family, just like him.

He was Second Young Master’s personal bodyguard, and Chang Feng was Eldest Young Master’s personal bodyguard.

In the past, Chang Feng had always fought alongside Eldest Young Master. He had never betrayed Eldest Young Master.

Wherever Chang Feng was, Eldest Young Master would definitely be there.

If Eldest Young Master was not around, Chang Feng would not live alone in this world.

Chang Feng swore to follow Eldest Young Master.

In the past, when Chen Qing was on a mission, he had been saved by Chang Feng. To him, Chang Feng was his savior.

Gu Zhou said calmly, “I saw Chang Feng!”

Chen Qing’s eyes widened involuntarily and he asked in shock, “When?”

Gu Zhou unlocked his phone and handed it to Chen Qing.

Chen Qing hesitated for a moment before taking the phone. He opened the video. When he saw the man in the video, his hand trembled as he muttered, “It’s really him. How is this possible…”

If Chen Qing had not seen the surveillance time in the video, he might have thought that the video was fake.

Although the man in the video had his head lowered, he recognized him at a glance. It was Chang Feng.

Be it his temperament or physique, it was exactly the same as Chang Feng’s.

Since Chang Feng was still alive, Eldest Young Master must still be alive.
