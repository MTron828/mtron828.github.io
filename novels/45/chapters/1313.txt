After Qiao Nian calmed down, she wiped her tears and shook Gu Zhou’s bed off. She said softly, “Alright, hurry up and sleep. I don’t think anyone will come again tonight!”

Gu Zhou kept holding Qiao Nian’s hand, staring unblinkingly at her. He said softly, “Sleep together.”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She saw Gu Zhou move to the side, leaving her some space.

Qiao Nian blushed slightly and said in a low voice, “That’s not good. What if I accidentally touch your wound?”

“It doesn’t hurt.”

“How can it not hurt?”

“Actually, I’m very happy.”

Gu Zhou’s voice was very soft, and his magnetic voice made one mesmerized.

Qiao Nian’s face turned slightly red. She pursed her lips and smiled, silently climbing into bed. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Gu Zhou pulled Qiao Nian into his arms. Although his wound still hurt slightly, none of this could compare to the joy of Qiao Nian being willing to marry him. He slept very peacefully.

…

At Mr. Chen’s villa.

Mr. Chen sat in the study, his gaze on the documents on the table. His thoughts had long drifted away.

He had been worried about Chang Feng. He did not know if Chang Feng could complete the mission or if he would be injured.

At this moment, there was a knock on the study door. Butler Zhao’s voice came from outside.

“Mr. Chen, Mr. Cui is here. He’s waiting for you in the living room.”

Mr. Chen frowned, and his expression changed slightly. He heaved a sigh of relief and returned to his usual calm self.

He had just stood up when his arm accidentally touched the cup on the table. The cup fell to the ground and shattered into countless pieces, and the tea leaves floated out.

Mr. Chen stood rooted to the ground and did not move. He looked at the teacup on the ground quietly. After a long time, he walked out.

Now, he was like a teacup placed by the table. If he wasn’t careful, he wouldn’t be smashed to pieces.

Mr. Chen’s eyes became firm. He would never be in the hands of others like the teacup. He had to control his own life and death.

Mr. Chen opened the study door and walked out expressionlessly.

Butler Zhao walked behind Mr. Chen and said in a low voice that only the two of them could hear, “Chang Feng hasn’t returned yet.”

Mr. Chen nodded and did not speak. He walked to the platform at the corner of the stairs and saw Cui Huai standing in the living room with six bodyguards beside him.

Was he here to settle scores?

Was Cui Huai sure that he was a traitor?

The atmosphere in the living room was oppressive. None of the servants in the villa dared to step forward.

With a faint smile on his face, Mr. Chen slowly walked down the stairs. He smiled at Cui Huai and said, “Mr. Cui, if I had known that you were coming, I would have picked you up at the door!”

When Cui Huai saw Chen Quan’s smile, a trace of coldness flashed in his eyes.

No matter what, Chen Quan could still smile. When Chen Quan walked to the living room, the murderous aura in the living room decreased a lot.

Cui Huai knew very well that Chen Quan knew that he was suspecting him, but Chen Quan still pretended not to know anything and greeted him with a smile.

The higher-ups actually felt that Chen Quan was more outstanding than him and wanted him to replace him.

Cui Huai narrowed his eyes slightly. He would never allow someone like Chen Quan to climb over his head.

It was very difficult for someone in their position to take a step forward, but after moving up, they could see a different world.

Cui Huai walked to the sofa and sat down. He crossed his legs and gestured for Chen Quan to sit down before saying, “Do you think our people can complete the mission?”

Chen Quan sat down as well. He lit a cigarette and shook it off before blowing out a smoke ring. After some thought, he continued, “Of course it can be done.”

Cui Huai was slightly stunned. Could it be that Chen Quan was really not a spy?

Chen Quan looked up at Cui Huai and sighed. “But if there’s a mole again, I’m afraid it’ll be difficult.”

Cui Huai frowned slightly and looked at Chen Quan coldly.

Chen Quan was really bold. Even now, he still dared to say that there was a spy.

Previously, he had asked Chen Quan to kill Gu Zhou, but Chen Quan had never succeeded. Instead, he had let Gu Zhou escape every time.

He had sent Kan Shan to kill Gu Zhou. Although Chen Quan and Chang Feng did not appear, Cui Huai had a nagging feeling that Chen Quan knew his intentions and did not appear.
