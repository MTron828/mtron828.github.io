Chapter 623: I Want Both

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

However, after the bad teacher was taught a lesson by Auntie Nian Nian, the school replaced him with another teacher. Since then, he had never been bullied again.

Moreover, his classmates’ attitude towards him had also improved.

Auntie Nian Nian really took good care of him.

“Then, is Little Qi willing to let Auntie Nian Nian be your mommy?” Gu Zhou asked tentatively. He was a little nervous.

When Gu Qi heard the word ‘Mommy’, his expression changed slightly. He silently squatted down against the wall and hugged his knees.

“If Auntie Nian Nian becomes my mommy, what will happen when Mommy comes back?” Gu Qi turned to look at Gu Zhou and asked seriously.

Gu Zhou paused. He had not expected Gu Qi to have such a deep obsession with his biological mother. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Does that mean my mommy doesn’t have a home anymore?” Gu Qi’s grape-like eyes were fixed on Gu Zhou.

“But…” Gu Qi frowned again and said in confusion,” If Auntie Nian Nian doesn’t become my mommy, will she leave soon? ”

“I want to live with Auntie Nian Nian forever, but I also want Mommy to come back. What should I do now, Dad?” Gu Qi looked at Gu Zhou pitifully.

Gu Zhou looked at Gu Qi dotingly. Although Gu Qi was very smart now, he was still a child. He didn’t know how to make choices, nor did he understand that one couldn’t have everything.

Sometimes, one had to give up something to gain something.

Before Gu Zhou could speak, he heard Gu Qi say, “Dad, I’ve thought it through. I want both of them. Let Mommy, Auntie Nian Nian, and I be together forever. That way, I’ll have two Mommies!”

Gu Zhou was speechless.

Gu Zhou felt that Gu Qi was the second person in the world who could make him speechless.

The first was Qiao Nian.

Naturally, Gu Qi didn’t understand what Gu Zhou was thinking. He said happily, “Dad, help me find Mommy. After that, you can rest. You don’t have to do anything!”

Gu Zhou felt that he was a tool.

Suddenly, an idea flashed in Gu Zhou’s mind. Gu Qi must have inherited his ability to scold people from his mother.

Just as Gu Qi was feeling happy, he suddenly recalled something. He lowered his gaze and asked in a low voice, “Dad, can you not get a doctor to visit me in the future? I’m not sick!”

Gu Zhou recalled how Gu Qi had squatted alone in the corner when he pushed the door open and entered. He looked weak and injured, and Gu Zhou’s heart ached.

“To see if I’m sick?” Gu Qi lowered his gaze, feeling a little sad.

“No, she just wants to confirm something.”

“What is it?” Gu Qi still looked a little disappointed.

“Of course it’s to confirm that you’re not sick. You’re a normal child. Your Auntie Nian Nian even said that you’re very smart and a little genius!”

When Gu Qi heard Gu Zhou’s words, the entire world lit up. His eyes were filled with laughter as he looked at Gu Zhou intently and said proudly, “Dad, although you’re a little stupid, your taste is indeed very good!”

Stupid?

Gu Zhou felt that he was the one who was hurt.

He was actually called stupid by his own son.

“Fortunately, you have good taste. That’s why you like such a good person like Auntie Nian Nian!” Gu Qi said happily.

Auntie Nian Nian was the first to believe that he was a normal person. She was willing to play with him, take care of him, and speak up for him in school.

It was a little unfair for Auntie Nian Nian to be with his silly father, but he would take good care of Auntie Nian Nian in the future.

For a moment, Gu Zhou didn’t know whether to be happy or sad. All sorts of emotions welled up in his heart.

“Can we not tell anyone what the two of us said today? This is a secret between the two of us.” Gu Zhou smiled.

He didn’t want Qiao Nian to know about his past, nor did he want Qiao Nian to know about Gu Qi’s biological mother.
