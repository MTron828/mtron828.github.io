Chapter 226: Gift?

A trace of admiration flashed in Professor Zhang’s eyes. He had been completely immersed in Qiao Nian’s performance just now. Not many people could play at this level.

Professor Zhang nodded in satisfaction and said, “You played well. I accept you as a student!”

Qiao Nian beamed. She hurriedly said, “Thank you, Professor Zhang.”

At the side, Director Hu felt the weight lift off his shoulders. Just now, he had been worried that Qiao Nian wouldn’t be able to enter the university successfully, but now, he no longer had to worry. He turned to look at Professor Zhang. “Alright, Professor Zhang, then you can start your classes. I’ll help her with the registration matters!”

“Thank you, Director Hu.” Qiao Nian smiled at him.

Director Hu looked at Qiao Nian and smiled. “Study hard!”

Qiao Nian smiled and nodded.

After that, Qiao Nian followed Professor Zhang and her new classmates back to the classroom. After she gave a self-introduction on stage, Professor Zhang arranged for her to sit by the window on the right side of the third row.

Half an hour later, class ended.

As soon as Professor Zhang left the classroom, many girls ran up to Qiao Nian and looked at her curiously.

“Nian Nian, did you really learn music all by yourself?”

“Nian Nian, how were you able to become so skilled?”

“Yes, yes. Do you have any tricks or shortcuts?”

“Nian Nian, you’re so outstanding. You don’t even need to come here to study!”

“Ahhh, Goddess Nian Nian, do you have any special study methods? Can you teach us pitiful mortals?”

Qiao Nian was stunned by their enthusiasm.

She had just played a song. Why was everyone surrounding her?

Qiao Nian opened her mouth to speak, but before she could say anything, a disdainful voice rang out from the side.

“Tsk, what’s so great about her? It’s just ‘Spring and Snow’. Who doesn’t know how to play that? Do all of you have to praise her like that?”

“She must have just been lucky to be able to play it well. Perhaps this is the only song she knows!”

“That’s right, that’s right. Perhaps she doesn’t even know all the musical instruments.”

When Qiao Nian’s deskmate heard these words, she frowned. Slamming the table, she stood up and retorted domineeringly, “Aren’t you going too far? Qiao Nian plays well. Everyone has to learn from each other. Why are you being like this? Is it so difficult for you to admit that others are outstanding? You fools!”

“Shut up!”

“You’re the one who should shut up! She’s clearly capable. This is reality. Didn’t you say that you know how to play it too? Come, play it. Let us all be the judges. Let’s see who can play it better!”

The two groups of people began arguing back and forth. They were just short of getting into a physical fight.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on her deskmate. She was small, and had half of her hair in a bun. There was a bright red bow tied around her head, and she was wearing a blue and white dress. She looked adorable.

She had never expected this girl to be so domineering, almost as if she were a mafia boss.

Just as the two sides were arguing, there came a knock on the door. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Everyone looked over in unison.

“Who are you looking for?”

A girl in a wine-red dress stood at the door. Her figure was extremely voluptuous, and her chest size looked to be about 34F.

“Which one of you is Qiao Nian?”

Qiao Nian said calmly, “I am.”

In her high heels, the girl walked towards Qiao Nian step by step, her skirt swaying in the wind. She stopped in front of Qiao Nian and glanced at her face, saying, “Senior Xia asked me to give you a gift. I hope you like it!”

With that, the girl placed a gift box on Qiao Nian’s table.

Qiao Nian looked at the girl in the red dress, confusion written all over her face.

Her deskmate immediately answered for Qiao Nian. “Nian Nian, Senior Xia is the campus belle of our department. She’s beautiful, kind, and has good grades. She’s very friendly to all the juniors. Look, she came to give you a gift the moment you entered the school!”

Qiao Nian looked at her deskmate in confusion. Why did she feel that her deskmate’s praise was laced with sarcasm?

“Senior, please thank Senior Xia for me,” Qiao Nian said calmly.
