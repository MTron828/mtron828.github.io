Chapter 153 Skilled Methods

Lin Tao, who had been standing at the side, frowned.

Jiang Yue was clearly a master of appearances. Right from the beginning, she had the upper hand. She pretended to be gentle and considerate, but in reality, there was malice behind that smile.

Qiao Nian’s gaze was fixed on the box Jiang Yue was holding.

Jiang Yue was getting impatient, but she still put on a gentle and magnanimous facade. She handed the other box to Qiao Nian. Seeing that Qiao Nian didn’t take the box, Jiang Yue spoke in a persuasive voice. “A gown designed by Mr. S can’t be bought with money, either. Most young ladies would long to get their hands on such a gown. This is also a gift from Grandma. I hope you can accept it.”

Qiao Nian remained impassive. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Jiang Yue continued to persuade her. “You’re the first speaker tonight. If you go onstage in this casual outfit, it might be a little impolite. You’d better change into this gown quickly.”

Jiang Yue spoke very well, her manner extremely proper. Her words were filled with consideration for Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian looked at Jiang Yue calmly and said with disdain, “It’s not my gown. Why would I want it?”

The smile on Jiang Yue’s face froze. She hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to refuse outright, and in public no less.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on the box Jiang Yue was holding. She said with certainty, “The gown in here is mine.”

Zhao Qian, who was standing at the side, walked over to Qiao Nian and said, “Sister Yue, why don’t you…”

Before Zhao Qian could finish her sentence, she sensed Jiang Yue glaring at her. Frightened, she took a step back.

Jiang Yue smiled at Qiao Nian.

Of course, she didn’t believe for one second that Grandma had made this gown for Qiao Nian. After all, this gown was made with her favorite diamond.

Jiang Yue thought that Qiao Nian was just jealous.

In the past, she had always thought that Qiao Nian was a completely emotionless person. Yet, it seemed that Qiao Nian was now beginning to learn to steal from her. Jiang Yue hadn’t expected this at all.

Liu Yu wanted to scold Qiao Nian, but was stopped by Jiang Yue.

With a troubled expression on her face, Jiang Yue looked up at Qiao Nian and said, “Sister Nian Nian, I know that you’re fond of the gowns made by Grandma, but every gown Grandma makes for me is tailored to my size. If not for that, I’d have given you the gown.”

Jiang Yue spoke persuasively and patiently. “If you like Grandma’s gowns, I’ll tell Grandma later and ask her to make one for you next time.”

Jiang Yue continued, “I’ll have to trouble Sister Nian Nian to wear the gown made by Mr. S!”

“I’ll only wear my own gown,” Qiao Nian said coldly.

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Liu Yu turned red with anger. In an affected manner, she said, “Qiao Nian, don’t you have some shame? Jiang Yue is Matriarch Gu’s granddaughter. If Matriarch Gu makes a gown, it’s definitely meant for Jiang Yue. What status do you have? What right do you have to compare yourself to Jiang Yue?”

“That’s right. Qiao Nian is too shameless. She’ll try to snatch anything that’s of good quality, even when those things don’t belong to her.”

“I really don’t understand. Shouldn’t she be grateful to the Gu family? Why is she making things difficult for Jiang Yue?”

“This is what it means to be an ingrate!”

As Lin Tao listened to everyone’s comments about Qiao Nian, her beautiful fox-like eyes filled with coldness. She pursed her lips in dissatisfaction.

She had known Qiao Nian for a long time. She knew Qiao Nian’s character well. Qiao Nian wouldn’t make a scene with Jiang Yue for no reason. Something was definitely wrong.

At this moment, someone nearby said, “Let us see the gown Matriarch Gu designed!”

“That’s right, that’s right. Qiao Nian’s trying so brazenly to get her hands on this gown. It must be stunning!”

“That’s right, that’s right. Qiao Nian doesn’t even want the gown Mr. S designed!”

Jiang Yue smiled and nodded. She said gently, “Since everyone wants to see it, I’ll take it out!”

She bent down and opened the box containing the gown Matriarch Gu designed.
