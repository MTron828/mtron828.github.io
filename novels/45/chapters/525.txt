Chapter 526: Hold Me!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian hesitated for a moment before reaching out, but she refused to place her hand on Gu Zhou’s waist.

“Nian Nian, why aren’t you hugging me?”

Hearing Gu Zhou’s words, Qiao Nian was afraid that he would cause trouble again. She hurriedly placed her hand on his waist. With a red face, she said sternly, “Alright, you’re not allowed to speak anymore. Hurry up and sleep!”

Gu Zhou silently moved closer to Qiao Nian.

In that instant, she pressed herself against his back.

Even through their pajamas, she could feel the heat of his body.

At the thought that she was still hugging Gu Zhou, Qiao Nian’s hands trembled involuntarily. Her heart raced.

Gu Zhou didn’t seem to know that Qiao Nian was very nervous now. He casually placed his hand on the back of Qiao Nian’s hand and gently rubbed the pad of her index finger again and again, as if teasing Qiao Nian’s heart.

Qiao Nian wanted to retract her hand, but Gu Zhou held on tightly, not giving her a chance.

For some reason, she thought of Gu Chuan again, and her heartbeat instantly became chaotic.

The thunder had sent Gu Chuan away just now. Could it be that Gu Chuan had returned?

Qiao Nian felt increasingly uneasy. She pursed her lips slightly and asked tentatively, “Zhou Zhou, are you asleep now?”

Gu Zhou’s clear voice sounded. “Nian Nian is naughty. You can’t speak when you’re sleeping.”

When Qiao Nian heard this voice, she heaved a sigh of relief.

Fortunately.

As long as it was not Gu Chuan.

With that thought in mind, Qiao Nian switched off the lights in the room with her other hand.

The entire room instantly turned dark. Qiao Nian could still hear his breathing even after he fell asleep.

However, Qiao Nian couldn’t fall asleep no matter what. Her current position with Gu Zhou was too ambiguous.

Besides, it was hot and sweaty where the two of them were pressed together.

She had slept with Gu Zhou before, but they had half the bed each. How could they sleep so intimately together?

Besides, she was the one holding him…

At the thought of their current positions, Qiao Nian didn’t know how to describe it.

She was a normal adult woman, and she was holding a handsome, fit man. This was simply…

Qiao Nian’s face turned redder and redder, and her body tensed up. She tightened her grip on him uncontrollably, but she didn’t realize it.

After an unknown period of time, Qiao Nian was still wide awake. She hugged him mechanically.

She felt like there was a difference between ice and fire. This was even more exciting than knowing that she and Lu Zhu were her biological brothers…

Her reunion with Lu Zhu was just an emotional stimulation.

But now, she was hugging him to sleep. That was a double shock, both physically and mentally.

Furthermore, the man felt nothing. His breathing became lighter and lighter, as if he were sleeping peacefully. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Qiao Nian pursed her lips slightly and called out tentatively, “Zhou Zhou?”

However, the man didn’t speak. The only response she got was his gentle breathing.

It seemed that he had really fallen asleep.

Then she could pull her hand back!

At this thought, Qiao Nian pursed her lips and tried to retract her hand.

However, the sleeping Zhou Zhou seemed to feel especially insecure. When she moved, he held her hand even harder and even pulled her hand to his chest.

This…

Qiao Nian had already felt uncomfortable hugging him to sleep. Now, she could still feel his strong heartbeat in her palm. Her mind was in a mess.

This was simply killing her!

In the darkness, Gu Zhou slowly opened his eyes. He felt the softness in his palm and looked coldly at the scenery outside the window. There was no starlight in his eyes.
