Chapter 613: Dreaming?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

When Gu Zhou heard Chen Qing’s words, he frowned slightly. No wonder he had no impression of what happened.

However, he had a dream previously. He vaguely saw Qiao Nian and had always thought that she had returned. However, when he walked out of the room, he realized that Qiao Nian had just returned from outside.

Nian’er?

At that time, he seemed to have called Qiao Nian that. However, he only saw Qiao Nian’s retreating back.

When he woke up, he thought that he had just been dreaming, but he could still smell Qiao Nian’s scent.

… .

Qiao Nian realized that Gu Qi seemed to dislike meeting outsiders. She turned to look at Su Sheng, who was standing at the door, and said softly, “Miss Su, can you please wait for me outside for a while?”

Su Sheng smiled and nodded. “Okay.” She walked out and closed the door considerately.

After Su Sheng left, Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. She looked at Gu Qi dotingly. “Little Qi.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

When Gu Qi heard Qiao Nian call him, he took the blanket off his face. His beautiful black grape-colored eyes looked at Qiao Nian innocently.

The moment Qiao Nian met Gu Qi’s eyes, her heart warmed. She said gently and dotingly, “Little Qi, if any outsiders come to our house in the future, you have to greet them, understand?”

She felt a little sad. Gu Qi had clearly suffered greatly.

Previously, she had heard from Chen Qing that the nanny who took care of Gu Qi was a bad person. Not only did that nanny not treat Gu Qi well, but she also abused Gu Qi and said some nasty words.

Gu Qi was just a three-year-old child. He definitely couldn’t accept so much damage.

Seeing that Gu Qi was silent, Qiao Nian gently caressed his face. All children had baby fat, but Gu Qi’s face didn’t have much.

“Little Qi, be good. This is your home. In the future, you have to act like a host, understand?” Qiao Nian said gently. “I know you won’t be able to accept this for the time being, but can we take it slow?”

“Auntie, aren’t you angry anymore?” Gu Qi stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian, his eyes flickering with confusion.

“Auntie will never be angry with Gu Qi, because Gu Qi is an obedient and adorable child!” Qiao Nian knew that a child’s confidence came from their parents’ encouragement. Although Gu Qi’s parents didn’t have the time to take care of him, Gu Qi was living with her now. She would definitely take good care of him.

Gu Qi said nothing. He turned to look away.

If one looked carefully, they would be able to see the joy in Gu Qi’s eyes.

“Xiao Qi, Auntie will go out to receive the guests first. After I send her away, I’ll accompany you later, okay?” Qiao Nian asked softly.

“Okay.”

Gu Qi nodded obediently.

Seeing how obedient Gu Qi was, Qiao Nian’s eyes were filled with smiles. Sighing slightly, she leaned over and planted a gentle kiss on Gu Qi’s forehead.

Gu Qi sensed something strange on his forehead, and his pupils dilated involuntarily. The spot on his forehead where Qiao Nian had touched was burning hot.

The heat traveled from his forehead to his entire body.

This strange feeling gave him the illusion that Auntie was like Mommy.

“Good boy.” Seeing Gu Qi staring unblinkingly at her, Qiao Nian smiled and said, “Then I’ll leave first!”

Gu Qi nodded, blushing.

Just like that, he lay on the bed and watched Qiao Nian leave. A trace of complexity flashed in his eyes.

After Qiao Nian came out of Gu Qi’s room, she saw Su Sheng waiting for her. Seeing that Su Sheng was about to speak, she hurriedly said, “Let’s go down and talk!”

The two of them walked down the stairs. When they arrived at the living room on the first floor, Qiao Nian looked at Su Sheng guiltily and said softly, “I’m sorry about just now. Little Qi’s situation was a little complicated, so I couldn’t get you to go in and chat with him for a while.”

Su Sheng frowned and looked at Qiao Nian worriedly. “How long has he been in this state?”

Qiao Nian recalled Chen Qing’s words. She hesitated for a moment before saying, “He seems to have always been like this.”
