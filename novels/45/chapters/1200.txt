1201 Yue’er is very afraid

Thank you readers!

Perhaps this was love!

Gu Zhou liked Qiao Nian and was willing to give up everything for her. He was also willing to collaborate with Qiao Nian and Lu Jiang.

Jiang Yue clenched her fists tightly, but she quickly let go. She had more important things to do now.

Boss Jin looked at the untrimmed quarry stone in the display cabinet and frowned. After much hesitation, he didn’t know which stone to choose.

Boss Jin looked at Jiang Yue beside him and met her affectionate eyes. He couldn’t help but smile and ask gently, “Yue’er, which raw stone do you think we should choose?”

Jiang Yue leaned against Boss Jin, looking like a helpless little bird. A shy smile appeared on her face as she said coquettishly, “Godfather, I don’t even know how to gamble on stones. I’ll let Godfather decide!”

Jiang Yue followed Boss Jin. She understood one thing. Boss Jin liked vase-like beauties.

The so-called vase beauties were those who were good-looking and didn’t know anything.

It was best if she was an innocent beauty. Perhaps Boss Jin was used to the darkness in the circle and liked purer girls!

Boss Jin looked at the innocent Jiang Yue and his heart instantly softened. He said gently, “This stone looks good. Let’s choose this one!”

Jiang Yue smiled and nodded. Her gaze moved from Boss Jin’s face to the stone.

Boss Jin said to the cutter, “I’ve decided. This stone. Cut it open now!”

“Alright, Boss Jin, this piece costs a total of thirteen million!”

Boss Jin nodded and handed the card to the cutter.

The cutter swiftly swiped his card, then took the stone and prepared to cut it.

Jiang Yue looked at Boss Jin shyly and asked sweetly, “Godfather, will you be so good to Yue’er for the rest of your life?”

Jiang Yue didn’t want to say such things at all, but Boss Jin liked such women.

She had already grasped Boss Jin’s preferences.

Boss Jin looked at Jiang Yue’s touched expression and nodded. “Yue’er, you’re so obedient. Of course I’ll treat you well for the rest of my life. It’s not like you don’t know that you’re my baby.”

As he spoke, Boss Jin’s hand slipped under Jiang Yue’s skirt restlessly. He pinched Jiang Yue’s butt. It felt good, but he couldn’t help but rub it again. Finally, he patted it. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The smile on Jiang Yue’s face did not change. She was already used to Boss Jin’s actions. She leaned into Boss Jin’s arms like a little bird and frowned slightly. With a weak expression, she said, “Godfather, but Yue’er is very afraid.”

Boss Jin looked at Jiang Yue in confusion and asked, “What are you afraid of? With me around, no one will bully you.”

“But” Jiang Yue slowly lowered her gaze. A tear rolled down her cheek, making her look pitiful.

“What happened?” Boss Jin looked at Jiang Yue worriedly.

Jiang Yue looked up at Boss Jin with teary eyes. Her sparkling tears sparkled with seven colors under the light.

Boss Jin’s eyes widened. He had played with many women, but none of them could compare to Jiang Yue.

In the past, he hated it when women cried, but not only did he not dislike Jiang Yue crying now, but he even felt heartache.

Boss Jin frowned and said coldly, “No one dares to touch my woman!”

“Godfather, I know you’re the best. Don’t be angry. If you get angry and ruin your health, Yue’er’s heart will ache,” Jiang Yue said gently.

“Tell me, who is that person?” Boss Jin said angrily.

“Qiao Nian.” With that, Jiang Yue reached out and took Boss Jin’s arm, looking like she was trembling.

Qiao Nian?

A trace of confusion flashed in Boss Jin’s eyes. He looked at Qiao Nian, who was standing not far away. Even if Qiao Nian was good-looking, she couldn’t compare to his Yue’er.

However, Qiao Nian was quite capable.

Boss Jin looked at Jiang Yue in confusion and asked, “There’s no enmity between the two of you. Why does she want to kill you?”
