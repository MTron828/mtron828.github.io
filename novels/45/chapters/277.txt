Chapter 278: Vicious

Gao Lin’s words enlightened everyone.

Xia Xue broke out in a cold sweat. She looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief. If Mr. Dong Hua heard her words, she would be forced to give up the position of female musician! Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Xia Xue’s eyes couldn’t help but turn red. She sighed softly and said, “If that’s the case, this student is truly a scheming person. I can’t help but shiver!”

“I don’t think so. She’s so beautiful. She doesn’t look like that kind of person.”

“She’s beautiful and kind. I don’t think she’ll think that way either.”

“Don’t you know what it means to have a vicious heart? The more beautiful a woman is, the more vicious she is!”

“If that’s the case, then it’s truly terrifying!”

“How did a vicious person get into this school?”

…

When Wang Xuan heard everyone’s words, she looked disapproving and said loudly, “Everyone, don’t listen to Gao Lin’s nonsense. Previously, in the classroom, she knew that Nian Nian had a ticket to Mr. Dong Hua’s concert. She was jealous, so she deliberately picked a fight!”

Wow!

Everyone looked at Qiao Nian enviously.

“Student, do you really have tickets?”

“Student, where did you get the tickets? Do you have any other channels?”

“Student, can I see your ticket and touch it? I want to feel how the ticket feels.”

…

The other students also gathered around curiously. One had to know that Mr. Dong Hua’s tickets were extremely expensive.

Seeing that these people were taking advantage of the situation, Gao Lin sneered and said disdainfully, “So what if she has tickets? Senior Xia Xue is a female musician personally selected by Mr. Dong Hua. That’s much more prestigious than sitting down and listening to the concert.”

“You’re right.”

“However, those who have tickets are all extraordinary. I’m really envious!”

…

No one wanted to offend Gao Lin, because they had just discovered that Xia Xue treated Gao Lin as a good friend.

Gao Lin could naturally tell that no one was willing to offend Qiao Nian. However, when she thought about how the glory she and Sister Xia Xue had just received had been snatched away by Qiao Nian, a ball of fire burned in her heart.

Gao Lin’s gaze inadvertently fell on Wang Xuan’s face. Her anger instantly found an outlet. She quickly walked up to Wang Xuan and questioned coldly, “Wang Xuan, no matter what, you’re still an outstanding student in our class. Qiao Nian taught you how to play the violin. Do you have to flatter her and belittle yourself?”

Without waiting for Wang Xuan to speak, she continued, “I understand now. You’re flattering her on purpose because she has the tickets. No wonder you’ve been sneaking around with Qiao Nian. Doesn’t your conscience hurt?”

When Qiao Nian heard Gao Lin’s words, her beautiful fox-like eyes curved up slightly. Her eyes, which were like a sea of stars, swept across Xia Xue’s face. She sighed meaningfully. “Yes, stealing from others. Doesn’t your conscience hurt?”

Xia Xue sensed Qiao Nian’s gaze on her. Her breathing quickened, and her heart jumped to her throat.

Strange.

She found herself suffocating under Qiao Nian’s gaze.

Could it be that Qiao Nian knew something?

Or was Qiao Nian the one who had been playing the violin here yesterday afternoon?

Xia Xue was flustered, but she quickly calmed down.

So what if that person was Qiao Nian?

Mr. Dong Hua had already appointed her to be his female musician. Moreover, Brother Cao had already posted on Weibo. This matter was already set in stone. It could not be changed.

If Qiao Nian really wanted to blame someone, she could only blame herself for being unlucky.

After thinking through the implications, Xia Xue’s uneasy heart slowly settled back down. She looked at Qiao Nian with a serious expression, as if she were reprimanding her. She said, “Student Qiao Nian, I know that you’re eager to become famous. I can also understand that you want to replace me as the female musician of Mr. Dong Hua’s concert. This represents your ambition. However, Student Qiao Nian, Mr. Dong Hua’s concert is about to begin. Please don’t come to this practice room again to disturb my practice.”
