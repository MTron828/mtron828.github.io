1086 How Dare You Say That About Dad?

Qiao Xin was very sad because of Qiao Yu’s coldness and Su Xue’s betrayal. She felt that Qiao Shan was the only person in this world who cared about her. Now that she heard Su Xue question Qiao Shan, her expression immediately darkened. She looked at Su Xue with a dark expression.

“You still have the cheek to say that about Dad?” Qiao Xin panted heavily, looking as if she wanted to eat Su Xue alive.

When Su Xue heard Qiao Xin’s question, she froze for a moment. She looked at Qiao Xin sadly.

Back then, she didn’t agree with Qiao Shan’s suggestion to hand Qiao Xin over to Lu Zhu, but Qiao Shan was very firm. She had no choice but to hand Qiao Xin over to Lu Zhu.

!!

But halfway through, she gave up on the thought of handing Qiao Xin over to Lu Zhu. At that time, she didn’t have time to explain so much to Qiao Xin.

She wanted Qiao Xin to escape, but she never expected Lu Zhu to still catch Qiao Xin.

She clearly loved Qiao Xin the most, but Qiao Xin hated her now!

Su Xue’s heart felt as if it had been cut off piece by piece by a small knife. She was in so much pain that she wanted to die.

“This wasn’t even my idea…”

“Enough!” Before Su Xue could finish her sentence, Qiao Shan interrupted her.

Su Xue looked at Qiao Shan in disbelief and asked in despair, “You’re framing me!”

Qiao Shan was really worried that Su Xue would let it slip. With a cold expression, he said sternly, “Do you really want Qiao Xin to fall into hell? Do you still want her to live?” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Su Xue’s heart ached. She turned her head inch by inch to look at Qiao Xin, only to see Qiao Xin glaring at her with hatred written all over her face.

She recalled the way Qiao Xin had looked at Qiao Shan just now. Su Xue instantly understood.

Although she couldn’t stand Qiao Shan’s hypocrisy, Qiao Xin might not be able to accept the truth if she exposed him now.

She swallowed the truth that was at the tip of her tongue!

Su Xue slowly closed her eyes, two streams of tears flowing down her face!

For the sake of her daughter’s mental state, she couldn’t tell the truth. She could only take the blame.

If her daughter really knew that her parents had abandoned her!

It was precisely because her parents had abandoned her that her daughter had been tainted!

Now, her daughter was going to be sent to prison by the police!

Qiao Xin had already experienced all the most bitter things in her life.

She couldn’t make things worse for Qiao Xin.

No one could bear the truth.

Su Xue looked at Qiao Xin sadly. As a mother, she was useless. She couldn’t protect her daughter well!

Qiao Xin naturally saw the guilt and sorrow on Su Xue’s face clearly. Her eyes were filled with sarcasm as she mocked, “I’m going to jail soon. You don’t have to work so hard to pretend that you like me anymore. You’ve gotten what you wanted now, because no one will bully your precious son anymore!”

When Qiao Yu heard Qiao Xin’s words, he frowned in displeasure. He felt that Qiao Xin was still being stubborn. He wanted to say a few more words to Qiao Xin, but he was afraid that she would take things too hard.

Qiao Yu sighed helplessly.

His loyal, innocent, and kind sister had taken a detour. Now, she didn’t even have the chance to correct herself!

Qiao Shan heaved a sigh of relief. Fortunately, no one brought up the topic again. It had really frightened him to death!

No matter what, it was enough as long as he could maintain his image!

Qiao Shan looked at Qiao Xin with heartache. To be honest, he was willing to exchange his leg for Qiao Xin’s, but he couldn’t use Qiao Yu’s future to exchange for Qiao Xin’s. Qiao Yu was his hope, and the hope of the Qiao family.

Su Xue looked at Qiao Xin with tears streaming down her face. Although she had cheated on Qiao Shan and betrayed him, she had genuinely loved and cared for her two children.

She had never expected that she would become a vicious mother in her daughter’s eyes. She had been forced to take the blame. She was clearly the person who loved her daughter the most.

Su Xue’s legs gave way and she fell to the ground. Her voice trembled as she explained, “Xiao Xin, it isn’t what you think at all. I never thought of harming you. Someone else forced me!”

“Did someone else force you? If you don’t agree, will he let you die?” Qiao Xin questioned coldly. She sneered. “How can you say such things?”

“I’m telling the truth!” Tears streamed down Su Xue’s face as she looked at Qiao Xin pleadingly. “I really didn’t lie to you!”
