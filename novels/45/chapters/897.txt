898 Bitter Life

Chen Qing was still holding the folder in his hand. He lowered his head and went down the stairs. As he walked, he looked at the document in his hand. “Second Young Master, I’ve already found Song Man’s…”

As he spoke, he walked over to Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian. When he met Gu Zhou’s cold eyes, a chill ran down his spine.

He seemed to have arrived at the wrong time. He seemed to have disturbed Second Young Master and Second Young Madam.

Chen Qing yearned to find a hole to hide in, but there was no such hole here.

Gu Zhou narrowed his phoenix-like eyes, which were filled with coldness. He said, “I remember that the Dongjiang villa is short of a bricklayer.”

Chen Qing was so aggrieved that tears were about to fall.

He had to put up tiles again.

Why was his life so bitter?

He didn’t want to put up tiles. He really didn’t want to!

However, Second Young Master was his superior. He had no choice but to do so. He sighed and said, “I-I’ll go in a while.”

Chen Qing was really worried that something would happen to his waist.

Suppressing her laughter, Qiao Nian remained silent.

Gu Zhou didn’t let go of Qiao Nian’s hand. He looked at Chen Qing expressionlessly and asked, “Continue!”

Chen Qing was slightly stunned, but he quickly reacted and said, “I found out that Song Man had been living in the slums of Wucheng before she went to Hai Cheng.”

When Gu Zhou heard Chen Qing’s words, his frown deepened, and he fell into deep thought.

When Qiao Nian heard Chen Qing’s words, she turned to look at Gu Zhou. If she remembered correctly, Gu Zhou had lived in Wucheng when he was young.

If Song Man had lived in the slums of the Wucheng in the past, she could understand why she could hide her identity in the slums of Hai Cheng for five years.

Could it be that Gu Zhou and Song Man had a relationship in the Wucheng?

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou with heartache and analyzed. “In that case, the mother of the children might also be from Wucheng.”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he shook his head in disapproval. “Not necessarily.”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion. “Why? Didn’t you have an accident in Wucheng? Since Song Man could raise Xiao Shi, it means that Song Man knows the mother of the child!”

“Not in Wucheng.” Gu Zhou frowned. He looked up at Qiao Nian and said, “The plot against me happened in An City.”

“An… An City?” The blood drained from Qiao Nian’s face. Her palm instantly turned cold, and she slowly pulled her hand out of his. Unwilling to give up, she asked again, “Shouldn’t you have been in the Wucheng back then? I remember that you only came to An City later.”

In the past, she had always thought that Gu Zhou lived in Wucheng.

However, she had never expected Gu Zhou’s one-night stand to happen in An City.

Gu Zhou had also told her about that night. She felt an invisible hand strangling her neck, and she couldn’t breathe.

Gu Zhou could naturally tell that something was wrong with Qiao Nian’s expression. He said, “I was here to do something back then. I didn’t expect to be schemed against.”

“What day was it?” Qiao Nian’s voice trembled. She pursed her lips tightly, trying hard to remain calm.

“Which day?”

“The day you were schemed against.” Qiao Nian’s eyes were filled with panic.

Gu Zhou told her the date. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Gu Zhou’s words exploded in Qiao Nian’s mind like a bomb.

Qiao Nian’s mind was in a mess. She couldn’t think at all.

Everything around her no longer seemed to matter. Qiao Nian was the only one left in the world.

The time and place were all right.

Qiao Nian had never expected the man that night to be…

Impossible…

How was this possible?

She must have heard wrongly!

That’s right, there was something wrong with her ears.

That wasn’t right.

Her five senses were normal. How could she have heard wrongly?

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze slightly, trying hard to pretend to be calm. Worried that Gu Zhou would notice something wrong with her, she hurriedly explained, “I-I just checked Song Man’s phone.”

“What did you find?” Gu Zhou asked.

“I need to take a look.” With that, Qiao Nian turned around and walked out without looking at Gu Zhou’s expression.

Qiao Nian was very thin. Perhaps it was because she had been too busy recently, but her body looked even thinner.
