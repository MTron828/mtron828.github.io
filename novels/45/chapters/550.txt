Gu Zhou’s dark eyes flickered. He looked at Qiao Nian calmly.

Was she mocking him, or praising him?

Gu Zhou did not speak either. Pursing his lips, he opened the door and walked out. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Qiao Nian hurriedly took the medical kit and followed closely behind.

The two of them had just gone downstairs when Qiao Nian saw Gu Qi lying on the sofa from afar.

Perhaps it was because of the fever, but Gu Qi’s face was flushed red, and his lips were already dry. Looking at his fragile state, he looked extremely pitiful.

Qiao Nian’s breathing grew heavier. Gu Qi was in a coma, but his biological father hadn’t appeared. Moreover, he didn’t notice Qiao Nian at all.

On the other hand, Gu Zhou, was quite a competent godfather. He was willing to bring the child over to raise him.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but think of herself when she was young. At that time, she was about the same age as Gu Qi. If she had left her parents at that time, she would have suffered a lot as well. She would have suffered all kinds of pain alone.

A child without a mother was really like a blade of grass.

Qiao Nian quickly walked to the sofa, leaving Gu Zhou behind.

“Second Young Madam.”

When the servants saw Qiao Nian approaching, they all stepped back.

The butler stood at the side, frowning worriedly at Qiao Nian.

Second Young Madam might overthink if Second Young Master suddenly brought a child back. He was also very worried that this child would affect the relationship between Madam and Second Young Master.

However, Qiao Nian was different from ordinary people.

When she saw that Gu Qi was in a terrible state, she immediately half-knelt beside him and swiftly opened the medicine box. She took out a thermometer and placed it under Gu Qi’s armpit to take his temperature.

Then, she began to examine Gu Qi’s eyes and take his pulse.

After this examination, she couldn’t help but frown.

This morning, Gu Qi had even sent her a WeChat message, saying that he wanted to treat her to a meal. Why had he suddenly fallen ill?

Perhaps Gu Qi had already fallen ill at that time, but he didn’t know it.

This poor child.

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian’s heart ached even more for this child.

The butler, who was standing at the side, saw that Qiao Nian was even more worried about this child than Second Young Master. Suddenly, he felt as if he was standing in the middle of a storm.

Who exactly had brought this child here?

Gu Zhou stood at the side, his gaze fixed on Qiao Nian’s face. Seeing Qiao Nian treat Gu Qi so seriously and nervously, he heaved a sigh of relief.

It seemed that he had worried too much.

Qiao Nian took out the thermometer. The temperature on it made her gasp.

“His fever has already reached 39 degrees Celsius. If it continues like this, he’ll be permanently affected by the fever. Moreover, his heart is beating very fast now, and his various indicators are very poor. He’s suffering and needs his temperature to be lowered by medicine and physical means!”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he felt a little choked up, but he didn’t say anything.

Qiao Nian could naturally see the worry in Gu Zhou’s eyes. She hurriedly added, “If this continues, it might trigger other illnesses. We need to bring him back to his room. I want to give him medicine!”

Gu Zhou looked at the butler beside him and said sternly, “Don’t tell Matriarch Gu about Young Master Gu Qi!”

With that, Gu Zhou stepped forward, grabbed Gu Qi, and carried him up to the second floor.

The butler looked at Gu Zhou’s back in confusion and frowned.

If he remembered correctly, Second Young Master should not like children. However, Second Young Master seemed to treat this child a little differently.

The butler’s gaze fell on the nervous Second Young Madam again, and his frown deepened.

For some reason, he recalled Jiang Yue’s words when she was chased out of the Gu family.

“Uncle Butler, Grandma has wanted a grandson for a long time. Perhaps she already has one, but she just didn’t say it out loud!”

At that time, after Jiang Yue finished speaking, she even gave the Gu family villa a meaningful look.
