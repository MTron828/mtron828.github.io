Jiang Yue was speechless. She looked at the butler helplessly.

Qiao Nian looked at the butler in admiration. The reason why he had been able to stay in the Gu family for so long was because of his ability and foresight.

Jiang Yue knew very well that the butler would not plead for her anymore. She looked at Zhao Qian helplessly. “Qian Qian…”

“Sister Yue Yue, I’m still young and don’t know anything!” Zhao Qian lowered her eyes slightly and said.

Jiang Yue retracted her gaze. She knew in her heart that Zhao Qian had little say in the Gu family. Even if she helped to speak up for her, her grandmother would not let her stay.

Left with no choice, Jiang Yue could only turn her gaze to Gu Zhou and call out pitifully, “Brother Ah Zhou…”

“Do you know the difference between you, Zhao Qian, and Qiao Nian?”

Jiang Yue bit her lip lightly. Of course she knew the difference between her and Zhao Qian.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Zhao Qian was just a young lady who only knew how to play around. Her grades were average and not outstanding at all. She was far inferior to her.

As for Qiao Nian, she admitted that she was very outstanding. However, Qiao Nian was just a country bumpkin. No matter how outstanding she was, she shouldn’t surpass her. Qiao Nian just didn’t know her limits.

“Just like you, Zhao Qian was raised by Grandma. However, after so many things had happened, she had never complained. She was pure and grateful! As for Qiao Nian, she had never complained about you either. She just wanted you to tell the truth. But what about you? You wanted to kill Grandma!”

At this point, Gu Zhou paused for a moment. “Both of them are humans, but you’re worse than a beast!”

Zhao Qian stood there obediently without saying a word.

Qiao Nian had never expected Gu Zhou to notice so many details.

She felt that there was nothing wrong with what Gu Zhou said. From the beginning, Jiang Yue had wanted Old Madam Gu’s life for money!

Jiang Yue’s legs went limp and she fell to the ground, her face filled with despair.

She had always thought that Brother Ah Zhou liked her very much, but she did not expect him to humiliate her in public.

However, she could not refute anything Brother Ah Zhou had said.

Gu Zhou walked up to Jiang Yue indifferently and picked up Old Madam Gu’s will. In front of Jiang Yue, he tore it into pieces.

Jiang Yue’s heart had already shattered into countless pieces, just like Old Madam Gu’s will.

Jiang Yue knew very well that the Gu family could no longer tolerate her.

Just now, she had been envious of Song Yu. Now, it seemed that she was actually the most favored one. It was just that she had personally torn everything apart.

Jiang Yue recalled what her grandmother had said previously and felt extremely ashamed.

She really knew that she was wrong. Even without those assets, she couldn’t bear to leave her grandmother.

At the thought of this, Jiang Yue knelt in front of Old Madam Gu again.

“Grandma, I know that I’ve made many mistakes before. I don’t want anything now. I’m sincerely repentant. I want to be by your side and take good care of you for the rest of my life. Can you not chase me away?”

Old Madam Gu’s eyes turned red as she said weakly, “I’ve given you a chance. Leave now!”

“Grandma, I beg you not to chase me away. I really know my mistake. I’ve always slept with you when I was young. I didn’t dare to sleep without you. Grandma, you’re my only family in this world. I can’t lose you. I…”

Jiang Yue’s words made Old Madam Gu sink into her memories.

When she was young, Jiang Yue had always stuck to her, unwilling to be separated for even a moment. No matter where she went, Jiang Yue had to follow.

At that time, her life gradually became more colorful because of Jiang Yue.

She had raised Jiang Yue like a goddaughter. Even though she knew that the two of them were not related by blood, she still doted on Jiang Yue.

It was precisely because of her love for Jiang Yue that she…
