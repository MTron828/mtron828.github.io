1046 Why

Qiao Yu looked at Su Xue’s dazed expression and sighed slightly. He turned around and entered the ward.

Su Xue followed the doctor in a panic. When she thought of how her precious daughter had been bullied, she felt terrible.

Before long, they arrived at the entrance of the emergency room.

Su Xue saw Qiao Xin lying on the hospital bed like a broken doll. Her eyes were glazed over, as if all that was left of her was her skin.

Qiao Xin’s face was bruised, and there was a lot of blood. She seemed to have been beaten up.

Su Xue looked at Qiao Xin. If the doctor hadn’t said that this was Qiao Xin, she wouldn’t have recognized her at all.

How had her daughter, the proud daughter of the heavens, become like this?

The current Qiao Xin was like trash in a trash heap. She was extremely dirty and disheveled.

Her clothes hung on her like pieces of cloth, barely covering her private parts. There was still a red-white muddy liquid on her legs. It didn’t take a genius to figure out what it was.

Su Xue’s legs gave way and she knelt on the ground, tears falling one by one. She had never expected her daughter to become like this.

Why did they torture her daughter like this?

Qiao Nian!

It had to be Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian was simply too vicious. She had deliberately used such a method to destroy Qiao Xin.

What right did she have?

A b*tch like Qiao Nian should be living in the mountains. Why did she come out to harm their family?

If she had known this would happen, she would have taken Qiao Nian’s money back then and thrown her away. She wouldn’t have caused the Qiao family to become like this.

Qiao Xin!

Her precious daughter.

She was clearly so smart, obedient, and adorable. How had she become like this?

She still remembered how obedient Qiao Xin had been when she was just born. She didn’t cry or make a fuss. Her eyes were round as she looked at her surroundings.

Later on, Qiao Xin grew up. She had a small round face and big eyes. She looked especially adorable. No one would dislike her.

At that time, she had thought that she had to mold her daughter into the most perfect woman and let her marry in a grand manner.

But all of that was gone.

I’m sorry.

If it weren’t for her selfishness, Qiao Xin wouldn’t have become like this.

Su Xue clenched her fists tightly, her nails digging into her palms. Her palms were bleeding, but she didn’t seem to feel it at all.

The doctor asked for the family signature from the nurse, but he couldn’t find her. After taking a few steps back, he saw Su Xue kneeling in front of Qiao Xin’s bed.

The doctor couldn’t help but sigh. Although she sympathized with Qiao Xin’s plight and understood how upset Qiao Xin’s mother was, she had to hurry up and get the patient’s family to sign the document so that the patient could undergo surgery.

The doctor walked up to Su Xue. Su Xue was also a frequent visitor to the hospital. During this period of time, Su Xue had dressed glamorously every day to take care of the patient.

But now, she felt that Su Xue seemed to have aged a lot. No, Su Xue had indeed aged a lot. Her hair seemed to have turned much whiter.

“Madam, you should sign it as soon as possible. The patient needs to undergo surgery early. If the wound is infected, I’m afraid there will be other problems,” the doctor said.

When Su Xue heard the doctor’s words, she turned her head inch by inch to look up at him. Her voice trembled as she asked, “Will… will she be fine?”

“We won’t know her condition until after the surgery,” the doctor said softly.

Su Xue took the pen and paper and signed it shakily. She struggled to get up and looked at Qiao Xin, who was lying on the bed.

She wanted to call out to Qiao Xin, but she swallowed her words. She looked at Qiao Xin with red-rimmed eyes.

It was all her fault.

She was not a qualified mother. She did not protect her child well.

Seeing Su Xue like this, the doctor comforted her softly. “Miss Qiao Xin has been calling for you. You should talk to her. Perhaps she’ll recover faster.”

Hearing the doctor’s words, Su Xue was stunned.

Qiao Xin was calling her?

Could it be that Qiao Xin didn’t know what she had done?

Or had Lu Zhu not said anything?

Su Xue’s eyes lit up with hope. She pursed her lips tightly. If Qiao Xin didn’t know, she could hide this matter. That way, Qiao Xin would never know about this.
