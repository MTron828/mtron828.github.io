1298 Caught Alive

Cui Huai’s gaze was vicious as his gaze fell on the two photos on the table.

These two photos were none other than Chen Quan and Gu Zhou.

He had always felt that Gu Zhou and Chen Quan had a deep relationship, but he didn’t know how the two of them had gotten in touch.

If Chen Quan rejected his suggestion, it meant that he was simply protecting Gu Zhou. Such a Chen Quan was useless. He would not keep Chen Quan by his side. Chen Quan was like a time bomb. No one knew when he would be blown to pieces!

He had thought that Chen Quan would agree directly, but he did not expect him to change the topic.

“Where is Kan Shan now?”

“Were they arrested?”

“Still alive?”

Cui Huai said angrily, “Yes, capture him alive!”

There was a moment of silence on the other end of the cell phone. Cui Huai’s lips curved into a cold smile. He knew that there was something wrong with Chen Quan. He could get his men to deal with him tonight.

“Mr. Cui, this matter is a little complicated.”

Chen Quan’s voice came from the cell phone. Cui Huai was so angry that he almost cursed. Suppressing his anger, he asked, “What’s going on?”

“Kan Shan is your man. He should have been sent to the international police by now. I don’t think Gu Zhou will trust the MY police. If I go now and I’m arrested, I can confirm that you want to kill him.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Cui Huai’s expression changed slightly. The reason why he had kept Chen Quan by his side was because Chen Quan was smart and thoughtful.

Chen Quan’s words made him unable to refute.

He could do whatever he wanted in MY, but the United Nations kept staring at him as if he was a heinous person.

Wasn’t he just making more money? Who didn’t want to make money these days?

“It’s fine. As long as you refuse to admit it,” Cui Huai said, bracing himself. It was really tiring to talk to Chen Quan.

“Even if I don’t admit it, everyone knows that I’m working for you. Perhaps you’ll be fine, but HH Corporation’s shares will probably plummet.”

Cui Huai remained silent. He regretted placing Chen Quan in such an important position. If Chen Quan was just an insignificant person, then he had nothing to worry about.

But Chen Quan could almost represent him outside!

“Plummet?” Cui Huai frowned.

Chen Quan’s voice sounded very calm.

Cui Huai lowered his gaze. With the evaporation of the shares, the entire Corporation was like a bubble. Without financial support, how could it continue to develop?

Cui Huai toyed with the prayer beads in his hand. After spinning them for a while, he suddenly stopped and asked tentatively, “Chen Quan, are you making all kinds of excuses to protect Gu Zhou?”

In the study of Mr. Chen’s villa.

Cui Huai’s words sounded like a question, but there was certainty in his words, as if he was already certain that he was protecting Gu Zhou.

When Chang Feng heard Cui Huai’s words, he frowned. His and Master’s worries had indeed appeared. Cui Huai had always suspected that Master was related to Gu Zhou in some other way.

He pursed his lips, trying hard to remain calm.

Mr. Chen laughed out loud and said unhurriedly, “Mr. Cui, you’re right. It’s very likely that Gu Zhou won’t come to MY again. The best time to make a move is in MY. Where is he now?”

“Gu Zhou seems to be injured. He’s in the hospital. I’ve already sent you the hospital address.”

A trace of worry flashed in Mr. Chen’s eyes, but he quickly calmed down. He pursed his lips and said, “I can’t attack. Let’s send another wave of people over. This opportunity is very important to us. We can’t let it go!”

When Cui Huai heard Chen Quan’s words, his frown deepened.

He stood up from his office chair and walked to the French windows. Looking at the neon lights and the traffic outside, his heart gradually calmed down.

As long as he could keep Gu Zhou’s life in MY, it didn’t matter who killed Gu Zhou. However, he still wanted to test Chen Quan, so he wanted him to go.

What Chen Quan had just said made sense. At this moment, Chen Quan’s voice came from the phone.

“Mr. Cui, if you’re worried about the others, I’ll go personally. I’ll definitely be able to take Gu Zhou’s life. I’ll try my best to hide myself and not let anyone discover my traces!”
