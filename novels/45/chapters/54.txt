Chapter 55: A Match Made in Heaven

Just as Qiao Nian was thinking about how she should bully Qiao Xin, she heard Gu Zhou speak.

“That friend of mine will be coming over tonight.”

Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat, but her expression remained calm. She tried to control her breathing and nodded.

The truth was finally about to be revealed.

She had finally found that person!

“Gu Zhou.” Guessing that Gu Zhou wasn’t the kind of person who would take advantage of anyone, Qiao Nian looked at him gratefully. “Thank you for last night.”

Gu Zhou did not reply. He walked towards the door with several documents in his hand. When he reached the door, he seemed to remember something and glanced back at Qiao Nian.

“Come down for breakfast after you’ve washed up.”

With that, Gu Zhou left without looking back.

Qiao Nian washed up and went downstairs. From afar, she saw Matriarch Gu sitting on the sofa, making a video call.

When Matriarch Gu heard Qiao Nian’s movements, she quickly bid goodbye to the person on the phone and hurriedly hung up the video call.

“Oh, my darling girl, you’re finally awake.” Matriarch Gu cast her phone aside and stood up to walk over to Qiao Nian. Her heart ached when she saw how pale Qiao Nian’s face was. “I heard from Ah Zhou that you had a fever last night. How do you feel now? Are you feeling better?”

“Thank you for your concern, Grandma. I’m already much better.” Qiao Nian said obediently, smiling at Matriarch Gu.

Seeing how sweet and obedient Qiao Nian was, Matriarch Gu’s heart melted. Holding on to Qiao Nian’s hand, she walked towards the dining room. “My darling girl, look at how thin you are. You must eat more good food to nourish your body.”

When they arrived at the dining room, Matriarch Gu pulled Qiao Nian to sit down with her, asking about her well-being. “Don’t worry too much about what happened last night. That girl, Shen Xing, has already gone to kneel in her ancestral hall. She’ll come specially to apologize to you later. Child, you keep everything to yourself. It’s not good for your health.”

Qiao Nian looked at Matriarch Gu gratefully. “Thank you, Grandma. I’ll know what to do in the future.”

“That’s right. If anyone dares to bully you, bully them back. Don’t show any mercy. If anything happens, Grandma will bear the consequences!” Matriarch Gu said heroically.

Smiling, Qiao Nian agreed.

At this moment, Gu Zhou walked in.

“Ah Zhou, my darling girl is still young. Take care of her more in the future. Don’t let anyone bully her.” Matriarch Gu looked up at Gu Zhou and said meaningfully, “You had better take my words seriously. I’m telling you, if anything happens to my darling child, I will never forgive you.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Gu Zhou gave an indifferent grunt of assent and sat down calmly on the other side.

After breakfast, Qiao Nian prepared to go out to meet Qiao Xin.

Matriarch Gu knew that Qiao Nian was about to leave the house. She pulled Gu Zhou over and said seriously, “Ah Zhou, send Nian Nian off later.”

“I’ll give her the car keys,” Gu Zhou said expressionlessly.

“Are you an idiot?” Matriarch Gu was about to explode with anger. “Nian Nian has already suffered greatly after marrying you. Can’t you treat her better?”

Gu Zhou frowned.

“Ah Zhou, let me tell you. I had a dream.” Matriarch Gu moved closer to Gu Zhou and whispered into his ear, “I dreamed that after Nian Nian married you, your illness was cured, and she treated Little Qi like her own son. This was a good dream. This means that the two of you are a match made in heaven. You have to treat her well, otherwise…”

Gu Zhou’s eyes flickered. He nodded.

When he saw Qiao Nian coming down the stairs with her bag, Gu Zhou stuffed a hand in his pocket and said calmly, “I’ll walk you out.”

Qiao Nian gave Gu Zhou a surprised look. She wanted to decline, but her gaze accidentally fell on Matriarch Gu, who was gazing at her dotingly. She nodded. “Thank you.”

Qiao Nian’s sharp eyes noticed that Matriarch Gu seemed to sigh in relief.

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian walked out side by side. They walked to the garage and Gu Zhou opened the door of the passenger seat of the car in a gentlemanly manner.

Qiao Nian thanked him politely and got into the car. She had just buckled up when she received a text from Qiao Xin.

Qiao Xin: Sister, where are you?
