Chapter 113: Gift

Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

Su Yan’s breathing quickened. Only at that moment did he realize how beautiful Qiao Nian was.

Many people around them were beginning to whisper among themselves.

“Oh my god, that woman is so beautiful. Whose daughter is she? Why haven’t I seen her before?”

“Yes, yes. Who exactly is she? Why do I find her familiar?”

“I don’t know. Could it be a new member of the elite in An City?”

A trace of gloom flashed in Qiao Xin’s eyes. Previously, she had stunned everyone, but Qiao Nian’s appearance had completely stolen the limelight.

Qiao Xin clenched her fists involuntarily, trying hard to regain her composure.

As long as Su Yan could work with Director Lin, Qiao Nian didn’t matter one jot.

Su Yan listened to the compliments that the people around him were heaping on Qiao Nian, his face full of disdain.

In his opinion, Qiao Nian was very cunning, She regularly tried to smear Qiao Xin’s name. This woman was simply evil to the bone.

No matter how good-looking Qiao Nian was, if she was utterly evil, she would be a vicious woman through and through.

But Qiao Xin was different. Qiao Xin was gentle and kind, and thought for him in every way.2

For his future, Qiao Xin had risked her life to get him a pot of Suranne Grass.

Unlike Qiao Nian, who had a vicious heart.

At the thought of this, Su Yan couldn’t even bear to look at Qiao Nian any longer. He glanced at Director Lin and said humbly, “Director Lin, please open the gift!”

$u Yan’s thought process was very simple. As long as Director Lin saw this gift, he would definitely choose to work with Su Yan!

Director Lin nodded and reached for the red cloth.

At this moment, a deep and magnetic voice resounded from the side.

“Uncle Lin, how have you been?”

Just as Director Lin’s hand was about to touch the red cloth, he retracted it.

Su Yan frowned and glanced at Gu Zhou warily.

Shouldn’t Gu Zhou be staying at home like the sickly invalid he was? What was he doing here?

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou, slightly stunned. However, she quickly recovered.

Naturally, Gu Zhou sensed Qiao Nian’s gaze. He glanced at her, his gaze lingering on her cherry-red lips for a moment, then gradually moved downwards. His gaze fell on her faintly exposed cleavage, and his eyes darkened just a shade. The aura of aggression intensified.

Chen Qing, who was standing behind Gu Zhou, frowned. Second Young Madam had dressed up today. For some reason, he sensed that she would definitely draw a lot of attention.

‘When Director Lin saw that Gu Zhou had arrived, he was overjoyed. He hurriedly stepped forward to greet him and said, “Nephew, you’re here. Come, come in!”

Gu Zhou gave Su Yan an indifferent glance and said, “Uncle, apart from congratulating you today, I would also like to formally ask to work with you on the production of medical equipment. Would you like to consider my proposal?”

Gu Zhou’s voice was gentle. Despite the domineering aura radiating from every inch of his body, his manner was sincere and polite. No one thought he was being rude.

Su Yan’s expression changed when he heard Gu Zhou’s words.

He had never heard of the Gu family planning to enter the medical field.

Was Gu Zhou really planning to enter the medical field on a whim, or was he trying to make life difficult for Su Yan on purpose?

Su Yan didn’t have the time to think too much about it. He couldn’t let Gu Zhou snatch this partnership away from him. He hurriedly stepped forward and said respectfully, “Director Lin, I’ve actually taken a liking to this project as well. As you know, the Su family has opened a chain of hospitals too. I

came today because I hope that you can consider the Su family in this partnership.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

When Gu Zhou had first spoken about the partnership, he gave off the impression of bringing it up casually, merely getting straight to the point and stating his purpose for coming. He had no intention of asking for an answer right there and then.

But when Su Yan brought this up, it was as if he was holding a knife to Director Lin’s neck, forcing him to give an answer right that instant.

Instantly, the atmosphere turned a little awkward.

Smiling, Qiao Nian stepped forward. Her gaze fell on Director Lin’s face, and her voice was as gentle as flowing water. “Director Lin, you haven’t seen this gift yet. This little assistant has been carrying this gift for a long time, and Mr. Su has been so kind as to bring it here.”

Director Lin suddenly smiled and said, “Yes, yes, yes. I’ve forgotten about it!”

Gu Zhou narrowed his eyes dangerously, his body radiating coldness..
