745 Don’t You Want to Ask Something?

She looked at Gu Qi gently and said softly, “Thank you, Xiao Qi. The candy is very sweet!”

“Auntie!” Gu Qi’s eyes were round and filled with stars.

Qiao Nian held Gu Qi and walked into the villa with Matriarch Gu.

Just as the three of them reached the villa, Qiao Nian heard footsteps coming from the stairs in the distance. She looked up and met Gu Zhou’s deep eyes.

The moment their eyes met, Qiao Nian’s heart raced uncontrollably.

Qiao Nian quickly looked away. Her expression was calm and indifferent as she looked down at Gu Qi with a smile.

Matriarch Gu was sensitive enough to sense that there was something wrong with Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian’s gazes. Thinking that the two of them had gotten into a conflict, she thought that she and Gu Qi were no longer suitable to stay here.

Matriarch Gu walked to Gu Qi’s side and took his other hand. She smiled at Gu Qi and said gently, “I’ll take you to pick grapes, okay?”

Gu Qi’s eyes were filled with anticipation. He looked up at Qiao Nian and asked seriously, “Auntie, do you want to pick grapes together?”

Qiao Nian didn’t want to face Gu Zhou now either. Just as she was about to agree, she heard Matriarch Gu say, “Xiao Qi, Auntie Nian Nian has something to say to Dad. Let’s go out first!”

Gu Qi turned to look at Matriarch Gu. Seeing Matriarch Gu nod, he immediately let go of Qiao Nian’s hand obediently and said, “Auntie, then talk to Dad nicely. Grandma and I will go pick grapes. I’ll give them to you when I get back.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

A trace of confusion flashed across Qiao Nian’s face. She smiled at Gu Qi and nodded.

When Matriarch Gu brought Gu Qi out, she gave all the servants in the room a look.

In an instant, only Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian were left in the living room.

Qiao Nian glanced at Gu Zhou with a complicated expression, not knowing if she should tell him that she already knew that Gu Qi was Gu Zhou’s child.

However, in the next moment, Qiao Nian thought it through. Even if she told Gu Zhou about this, it didn’t seem to be meaningful.

After some thought, Qiao Nian decided not to mention it.

Just as Qiao Nian was about to find an excuse to return to her room to rest, she heard Gu Zhou ask, “How was your conversation with your friend?”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned, not understanding what Gu Zhou was saying. In the next moment, she remembered that in order to go out, she had pretended that she was going out for afternoon tea with a friend.

Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou and was about to speak when she saw his serious expression.

Was Gu Zhou trying to find out who she was with?

“It was fine.”

Gu Zhou’s dark eyes were fixed on Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian felt uncomfortable under Gu Zhou’s sharp gaze. She had a nagging feeling that Gu Zhou already knew what she had been doing outside.

“I’ll go upstairs and rest first.” With that, Qiao Nian walked towards the stairs.

Qiao Nian had just taken two steps when Gu Zhou grabbed her hand.

A trace of confusion flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes. She turned to look at him.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian with a deep gaze. He pursed his lips slightly and asked, “Don’t you want to ask me about something?”

Her heart jumped to her throat.

Why would he ask that?

Did he know what she had just gone out to do?

How was this possible?

He had been staying at home.

If Gu Zhou knew that she had used his and Gu Qi’s hair for a paternity test, he would definitely stop her from doing it since he wanted to deceive her.

Qiao Nian remembered Matriarch Gu saying that Gu Zhou hated it when others asked about his past.

Qiao Nian gave a faint smile and shook her head. “No.”

Gu Zhou’s eyes narrowed slightly. He hesitated for a moment before letting go of Qiao Nian’s hand. His voice was low and lonely. “Then rest well at home.”

“Okay,” Qiao Nian replied and walked upstairs.

Gu Zhou stood rooted to the ground with a dejected expression. Looking at Qiao Nian’s gradually disappearing back, he sighed softly.

She probably wasn’t ready to discuss this topic with him yet.

She still needed time.

Actually, he needed time too.

He didn’t know how to explain this to Qiao Nian.
