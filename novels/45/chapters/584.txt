Chapter 585: Good Luck

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Gu Qi couldn’t believe his ears. He could actually live here with his father in the future and see his father every day!

“Really?” Gu Qi’s voice trembled.

Qiao Nian could naturally see the excitement in Gu Qi’s eyes. Her heart couldn’t help but ache.

She had been like this in the past, looking forward to living with her parents every day. When she found out that the Qiao couple weren’t her parents, she heaved a sigh of relief.

When she found her family, she was just as excited. She had also hoped to live with her family forever, but all of this was just an extravagant hope for her now.

Before she dealt with those annoying people, she couldn’t go back.

Qiao Nian held Gu Qi’s small hand. She didn’t want Gu Qi to live a difficult life like her. She didn’t want him to feel insecure every day.

“Little Qi, don’t you believe me anymore? When have I ever lied to you?” Qiao Nian looked at Gu Qi gently and said softly.

The light in Gu Qi’s eyes grew brighter and brighter. Ever since he got to know his aunt, the life he had wanted had gradually come true.

His father was willing to bring him home. He just had to find his mommy again.

Just as Gu Qi was about to speak, his gaze inadvertently fell on Gu Zhou. Only then did he realize that Gu Zhou was still there.

Gu Qi pursed his lips and moved his face closer to Qiao Nian’s ear. In a voice so soft that only the two of them could hear, he said softly, “Auntie, did you find your parents?”

Qiao Nian turned to look at Gu Qi and nodded gently.

“Congratulations, Auntie!” Gu Qi looked at Qiao Nian enviously.

Auntie was the person closest to him and had brought him a lot of good luck. Did this mean that he would be able to find his mommy soon?

The light in Gu Qi’s eyes grew brighter and brighter.

Seeing the change in Gu Qi’s expression, a trace of surprise flashed in Gu Zhou’s heart.

“Little Qi, are you happy about something?” Gu Zhou asked softly.

Gu Qi gripped Qiao Nian’s hand tightly. Finding his family was a small secret between him and Auntie. He didn’t want to tell his father.

Gu Qi pursed his lips and remained silent.

Qiao Nian turned to look at Gu Zhou. Just now, she had been too concerned about Gu Qi to take a closer look at him. When she looked into Gu Zhou’s eyes, she was stunned.

What was going on?

When did Gu Zhou become a panda?

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. Her face was flushed, and her hair was still a little wet. She looked like a beauty who had just stepped out of the shower.

His eyes narrowed slightly. It seemed that Qiao Nian hadn’t been with him last night and had slept very happily!

Gu Zhou said indifferently, “Grandma hasn’t come out since she entered the room yesterday afternoon. I wonder how she’s doing.”

Qiao Nian frowned and lowered her gaze. She sighed silently in her heart. She turned to look at Gu Qi with a smile and said gently, “Little Qi, play with Dad for a while. Auntie has something to do outside.”

Gu Qi sat on the spot, a little reluctant to part with her. However, he was afraid that Auntie would not like him if he didn’t listen to her. He nodded reluctantly. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

After Qiao Nian left, Gu Zhou walked to the bed and sat down.

Gu Qi’s gaze followed Qiao Nian’s figure. Even though Qiao Nian had already left to close the door, he still craned his neck to look. His eyes were glued to Qiao Nian’s face.

Gu Zhou leaned forward slightly, blocking Gu Qi’s view. “Are you hungry?”

Reluctantly, Gu Qi retracted his gaze. The light in his eyes dimmed a little as he shook his head. “I’m not hungry.”

Not hungry?

Gu Zhou looked at Gu Qi calmly. He felt that if Qiao Nian asked Gu Qi the same question, Gu Qi would definitely nod eagerly and ask Qiao Nian to feed him.

“Dad, can I really live here in the future?” Gu Qi asked carefully, his eyes filled with anticipation.
