Chapter 319: He’s Not Retarded

Moreover, his father felt that he was abnormal. His father often took him to the hospital. In the past, no matter what he said, his father would think that he was ill and spouting nonsense.

This time, his father only believed him after seeing Zhang Yi hit him with his own eyes.

Her father had even taught Zhang Yi a lesson.

At the thought of this, Gu Qi mustered his courage and blinked. His eyes sparkled as he asked, “Dad, will you leave me behind like Mom did?”

Gu Zhou and Chen Qing were both stunned.

They had always thought that apart from greeting people, Gu Qi did not say anything else.

Gu Qi was finally willing to speak more.

Gu Zhou should have been happy, but when he thought of Gu Qi’s words, his heart seemed to be clenched tightly by an invisible hand. It hurt terribly.

All these years, it was all his fault. Actually, he didn’t hate Gu Qi.

However, every time Gu Zhou saw Gu Qi, he would think of Gu Qi’s mother and what he had done to her that night.

In addition, he rarely smiled or teased Gu Qi. He had never even hugged Gu Qi. In addition, Zhang Yi had brainwashed Gu Qi, which was why Gu Qi was so reclusive.

So Gu Qi had always been able to speak.

Seeing that Gu Zhou was silent, Gu Qi frowned slightly and repeated, “Do you not want me anymore?”

Gu Zhou’s heart ached so much that he found it difficult to breathe. His heart ached as he watched Gu Qi gently stroke his head. He explained softly, “Why would you ask that? Dad never said that he didn’t want you. Moreover, Mom was just lost and couldn’t find you. You’re the most important thing to Mom and Dad.”

Gu Zhou frowned. He still remembered what his father had told him in the past, that his mother had gone to another world.

Later on, Zhang Yi told him that the other world was the world where the dead lived. It did not exist at all.

Hence, his father was the only one left in his world.

Gu Qi looked up at Gu Zhou and asked, “Does Dad not like me because I’m mentally retarded? Is that why grandma doesn’t live here with me?”

Gu Zhou was slightly stunned. Only then did he realize that Gu Qi had understood Zhang Yi’s words a long time ago. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Gu Zhou looked at Gu Qi with some heartache and said gently, “Gu Qi, you’re not a retard. It’s not like you don’t have anyone to dote on you. Mom, Dad, and Grandma all like you very much and dote on you a lot. However, because of some matters, you can only stay here temporarily. Don’t worry, no one will bully you again!”

Gu Qi hesitated for a moment, then wrapped his arms around Gu Zhou’s neck and buried his head in Gu Zhou’s shoulder.

How nice.

He wasn’t a retard!

He was not an unwanted burden!

However, his father had something on recently, so he couldn’t follow him home.

His father’s embrace was so warm. He suddenly felt sleepy and wanted to sleep in his father’s arms.

However, he did not dare to sleep. He was a little worried that when he opened his eyes, his father would return to his cold self. His father would no longer hug him either. His father would still think that he was a retard and did not like him.

Gu Qi tried hard to open his eyes, but his father’s embrace was simply too comfortable. He fell asleep involuntarily.

Gu Zhou carefully placed Gu Qi on the bed and tucked him in. His gaze fell on Gu Qi’s young face, and his eyes were filled with heartache.

Chen Qing stood at the side and finally couldn’t help but ask softly, “Second Young Master, should we bring Young Master back?”

When Chen Qing thought of what Zhang Yi had done, he said worriedly, “What if we find another nanny like Zhang Yi? Young Master is clearly smart and eloquent. He must have been bullied by Zhang Yi. That’s why he was so quiet!”

When Chen Qing thought of this, he felt a wave of lingering fear. “If this continues, I’m worried that Young Master will alienate us!”

Gu Zhou looked at Gu Qi’s face. After a long silence, he said, “But now isn’t the time.”
