Chapter 300: Sleeping Together

Fortunately, Gu Zhou stopped in front of her.

Qiao Nian swallowed nervously. She looked at Gu Zhou’s infuriated face. For some reason, she felt that Gu Zhou was acting strangely today.

Could it be that Gu Zhou had been provoked?

It didn’t look like it.

Could it be that Gu Zhou had a new personality?

Just as Qiao Nian was about to speak, she heard Gu Zhou say, “Didn’t you say just now that you were going to have a child tonight?”

Qiao Nian’s eyes widened and her face turned red.

Her gaze accidentally fell on the bed behind Gu Zhou. Only then did she realize that when she had just taken a shower, Gu Zhou had already changed it into an extremely luxurious double bed.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in surprise.

What was wrong with him today?

Didn’t he know that she had deliberately provoked Jiang Yue just now? Why did he take it seriously?

Qiao Nian’s heart was beating wildly. She looked at Gu Zhou worriedly when she saw that Gu Zhou’s face was getting closer and closer to hers.

Suddenly, Qiao Nian recalled the kiss in the living room.

Was he going to kiss her again?

Qiao Nian’s heart began to race.

Gu Zhou placed his hand on the handle of the wardrobe behind her. Indifferently, he opened the wardrobe door, took out a bathrobe, and walked towards the bathroom.

Gu Zhou exuded a cool aura, as if he had just been fooling around.

Qiao Nian was confused.

Qiao Nian found herself increasingly unable to understand Gu Zhou.

Qiao Nian’s brows furrowed deeper and deeper. She only looked away when she heard the bathroom door close.

The sofa bed she had been sleeping on had been replaced by a smaller one by Gu Zhou. Although she could sleep on it, it would be very uncomfortable. After some thought, Qiao Nian climbed onto the double bed.

She could no longer remember how long it had been since she had slept on a big bed.

The soft blanket made one feel especially comfortable.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but roll around on the bed. She found a comfortable spot and thought about falling asleep before Gu Zhou finished his shower to avoid embarrassment.

But she was thinking too much.

At this moment, Gu Zhou walked out of the bathroom.

Gu Zhou had only been in the bathroom for less than five minutes. Wasn’t he washing up too quickly? Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Qiao Nian suspected that Gu Zhou had just taken a shower. He hadn’t taken the shower seriously at all.

She did not open her eyes and continued pretending to be asleep. Suddenly, she felt the bed beside her sink a little.

Following that was the sound of Gu Zhou taking off his clothes.

Taking off his clothes…

Qiao Nian involuntarily closed her eyes. She could hear her heart beating wildly.

Thump, thump…

Again and again, it struck her eardrums.

Qiao Nian only hoped that tonight would pass peacefully.

While Qiao Nian was praying, she heard Gu Zhou’s low and hoarse voice.

“Do you not like children?”

Although Gu Zhou was just asking casually, she could sense an invisible pressure emanating from him. He was determined to get an answer.

Qiao Nian slowly opened her eyes. With her back facing Gu Zhou, she pursed her lips and asked, “Then do you like children?”

“I asked you first.”

Qiao Nian thought about it carefully and said, “They’re ok.”

This answer was no different from not answering at all.

After that, an awkward silence filled the bedroom.

“What about you?”

Gu Zhou said without hesitation, “I don’t.”

Qiao Nian’s body stiffened slightly. She suddenly recalled what had happened five years ago. Back then, she had wanted to give birth to a child because of that incident. She didn’t hate that child. Later on, that child was gone. She just felt guilty. That incident had been buried deep in her heart, and she couldn’t let it go.

Gu Zhou added lightly, “And I won’t have any either.”

Gu Zhou’s tone was firm and cold, as if he was warning her.
