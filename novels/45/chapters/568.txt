Chapter 569: Autistic

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Gu Qi was already awake.

But he was curled up under the blanket.

Gu Zhou sighed slightly, his brow relaxing. He walked towards the bed.

He was very tall. When he walked over, he blocked the sunlight from the window. An invisible pressure surged in his heart.

Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou and recalled that Gu Qi had just said that only outsiders would say “thank you”. Could it be that Gu Zhou had already treated her as…

This seemed unlikely.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Gu Qi’s face again. At this moment, Gu Qi was lying flat on the bed, curled up under the blanket. He was staring blankly at the ceiling, looking unwilling to communicate with anyone.

Strange, why had Gu Qi suddenly become like this?

Did Gu Qi dislike Gu Zhou, his godfather?

Naturally, Gu Zhou could also see Gu Qi’s current state. Feeling a little uneasy, he sat down by the bed and called out softly, “Gu Qi.”

However, Gu Qi was still the same as before. He was still unwilling to communicate with others.

The nanny’s words must have left an indelible impression on Gu Qi. He still remembered the nanny’s stimulating words.

“I just want you to listen to Dad and study at home. How can you sneak out? Fortunately, you’re fine. There are bad people everywhere. If you’re captured by bad people, you’ll never see Dad again!”

“Mr. Gu, this child is really worrying. He doesn’t want to do his homework, and the tutor can’t do anything about him. What should we do now? This child is already four and a half years old. He often goes out, and he doesn’t have any sense of safety. What if he doesn’t have basic common sense in the future?”

“You’re capable now?”

“It’s just a slap. Do you have to run out? Why? Are you trying to kill me?”

“Little Mute, you fool. Let me tell you, just because you’re disobedient, your grandmother doesn’t come to visit you anymore. Your mother doesn’t want you, and your father doesn’t come often. Only I’m kind enough to take care of you. You should be respectful to me, understand?”

“Were you pretending to be obedient just now? I thought you had improved. I didn’t expect a retard to be a retard. No wonder so many teachers couldn’t teach you. If I’m not wrong, your mother must be a retard. Otherwise, how could she have given birth to a fool like you!”

“You don’t know a single word now. How do you want me to answer your father, you fool! I really don’t know how a retard like your mother can be with your father.”

… .

Even an adult like her found those words ear-piercing and sad. How did Gu Qi endure it?

Seeing Gu Qi like this, Gu Zhou’s eyes dimmed. He called out softly, “Little Qi?”

Gu Qi stared at the ceiling without moving, as if he was immersed in his own world again.

A trace of worry flashed in Gu Zhou’s eyes, but he quickly returned to normal. He looked up at Qiao Nian. “Was he like this just now?” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. Just now, Gu Qi had been very obedient and understanding. She didn’t know why he had become like this.

Could it be that he had developed autism because he had lost his family and felt insecure?

Or did he want to use this method to make Gu Zhou care more about him?

Qiao Nian thought about asking Gu Qi later, so she nodded at Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou pursed his lips and said nothing. However, his gaze fell on Gu Qi’s face again. He stood up and walked out.

Gu Zhou walked out and said softly to Chen Qing, “Go and investigate if Little Master has been bullied recently.”

“Yes.” When Chen Qing heard Gu Zhou’s words, his expression darkened. He took out his phone and began to contact the person supervising the nanny.

After Gu Zhou walked out of the ward, Qiao Nian retracted her gaze and looked at Gu Qi, her eyes sparkling. She said softly, “Shall I leave first?”

Gu Qi blinked, as if saying goodbye.
