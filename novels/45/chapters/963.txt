964 Should She Get Out of the Car?

She silently put down her chopsticks, not daring to eat anymore.

Suddenly, a thought flashed across her mind.

Could it be that Gu Zhou was preparing to drive to a small forest and have a spectacular car earthquake to eat her up?

This…

!!

Should she get out of the car?

Qiao Nian’s mind was filled with thoughts of finding an excuse.

As Gu Zhou drove, he glanced at Qiao Nian from the corner of his eye. Seeing Qiao Nian’s shy expression, he felt his lower abdomen tighten. Thinking of the spicy duck neck he had just tasted, his breathing became a little erratic.

Qiao Nian put the duck neck away. After some thought, she said, “I have other things to do today, so I thought…”

“This matter is very important,” Gu Zhou said with a serious expression. “We have to resolve it now.”

When Qiao Nian heard this, she realized that Gu Zhou was talking about serious matters. Her mind must have been filled with those desires just now, which was why she was thinking about Gu Zhou and the car earthquake.

Since Gu Zhou said that it was serious business, it should be.

“Okay.” Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief when she noticed that Gu Zhou was driving into the city.

After a while, the car stopped. When Qiao Nian saw the name of the five-star hotel in front of her, she was stunned.

Memories from six years ago surged through her like a flood, drowning her. She rose and fell in the flood, struggling to survive.

She remembered very clearly that she had lost her innocence here back then. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in fear and unease. She saw that Gu Zhou was already standing at the door of the front passenger seat. He opened the door and looked at her intently.

… .

At the hospital.

Qiao Shan was pushed out of the operating theater by the doctors and nurses. He had already woken up during the second half of the surgery.

He lay on the hospital bed and looked at the lights above him. He was a little stunned as he listened to the doctors and nurses discuss the treatment after his amputation.

His leg had been broken by his biological daughter.

That was the daughter he had raised since he was young. What disappointed him the most was that his daughter had never asked him what he thought. Instead, she had broken his leg in self-defense.

His leg seemed to be necrotic. His bones were shattered and could no longer be repaired.

Qiao Shan was not a medical student. He did not understand why some people had problems with their legs and did not need amputation, but he did.

In a daze, Qiao Shan was pushed out of the operating theater.

The operating theater was filled with the smell of blood. When he came out, he was surrounded by clean air, and Qiao Shan’s mind became clearer.

Su Xue looked at Qiao Shan’s amputated leg, and her tears fell uncontrollably. She cried, “Brother Shan, sob, sob, sob. What will we do in the future…”

When Qiao Shan heard Su Xue’s concerned words, he felt a trace of warmth in his heart, but more than that, he felt frustrated.

He was a capable man. For some reason, he had become crippled!

“Shut up! Are you crying for me now?” Qiao Shan couldn’t help but lose his temper. “Do you think I’ve lived too long?”

Su Xue was shocked by Qiao Shan’s voice. She shivered in fear and said pitifully, “No, no. I didn’t mean that. I was just worried that you…”

Qiao Shan did not speak. He just lay on the hospital bed coldly, letting the staff push him into the ward.

Qiao Yu stayed by the bed in silence. He had prepared a private ward for Qiao Shan, which was very far from Qiao Xin’s ward.

When they arrived at the ward, the medical nurses gave a few reminders and left.

Seeing Qiao Shan like this, Qiao Yu said, “Dad, I’ll go buy you something. Take good care of yourself.”

Qiao Shan looked at Qiao Yu. His son was his only hope. “Go ahead. Be careful.”

Qiao Yu walked out of the ward, not forgetting to close the door.

Su Xue sat down beside Qiao Yu, tears falling silently.

Qiao Shan was in a bad mood because he had lost a leg. Seeing Su Xue cry, he was furious. He said angrily, “Look at what kind of daughter you’ve raised. Other than being jealous of others, she’s caused so much trouble since she was young. Every time, we’ve helped her clean up her mess. Now that she’s provoked someone we can’t afford to offend, I think our lives will be lost because of her sooner or later!”
