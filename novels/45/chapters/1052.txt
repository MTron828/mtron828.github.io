1053 Let’s go back!

Under such circumstances, Qiao Nian could have turned around and left, but she was a little curious about what Gu Zhou would do.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou frowned, exuding a cold aura. He said coldly, “In that case, we don’t have to meet again!”

With that, Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian. The moment he saw Qiao Nian, his eyes instantly softened. “Let’s go back!”

Holding Qiao Nian’s hand, he walked out.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s hand, which was holding hers. Her lips curved up slightly. It felt so good to be protected by her husband!

Since Gu Zhou had said that he would not be seen, he would be gone.

It seemed that Gu Zhou did not want to suffer at all!

Seeing that Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian were about to leave, the attendant hurriedly stepped forward and said anxiously, “Please wait!”

Gu Zhou frowned at the attendant.

“Mr. Gu, if you leave now, it will be very difficult for us. Please consider it again!”

“Your business has nothing to do with me!” Gu Zhou pulled Qiao Nian around the attendant and was about to leave.

“Brother Ah Zhou, please wait!”

Before they reached the door, a crisp female voice came from behind them, but the voice was a little timid, like that of an introverted girl.

Gu Zhou turned around.

Qiao Nian frowned imperceptibly. If she remembered correctly, it was Bai Hui who had invited Gu Zhou to dinner. How could there be another woman?

Qiao Nian turned around. When she saw the woman standing beside the attendant, her eyes lit up. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The woman in front of him looked weak. She was wearing a white sweater, light blue jeans, and a pair of sneakers. Her long black hair fell behind her, and her eyes were sparkling. She looked extremely pure.

She didn’t look very old, as if she was still in university.

Gu Zhou looked at her, surprise flashing in his eyes. “Chu Chu?”

Yu Chu smiled. When she walked up to Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian, she gave them a quiet smile.

Qiao Nian glanced at Gu Zhou. If she wasn’t wrong, the two of them should be very familiar with each other.

However, she had never heard Gu Zhou mention this girl before.

Yu Chu’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. When she saw Qiao Nian’s face clearly, her eyes lit up, filled with surprise!

“Brother Ah Zhou, this must be Second Sister-in-law!” Yu Chu asked softly.

Gu Zhou nodded indifferently. “Yes!”

The smile in Yu Chu’s eyes grew even brighter. With a blush on her face, she greeted quietly, “Hello, Second Sister-in-law. I’m Yu Chu!”

Although Qiao Nian didn’t know who Yu Chu was, she still greeted politely, “Hello!”

If she remembered correctly, Bai Hui and Gu Zhou were having dinner together tonight. However, Qiao Nian didn’t understand why Yu Chu was here.

Just now, the attendant had also said that Madam Bai did not welcome her into the private room. Could it be that Bai Hui wanted Gu Zhou and Yu Chu to eat together?

It was obvious that Bai Hui was trying to matchmake Gu Zhou and Yu Chu.

If Qiao Nian remembered correctly, although she and Gu Zhou had been secretly married, Gu Zhou had also told Bai Hui about their marriage.

Bai Hui had even brought Yu Chu over. She clearly wanted to break her and Gu Zhou up.

Bai Hui was simply taking things into his hands!

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze slightly, her expression unchanged!

Gu Zhou’s expression turned cold. He said expressionlessly, “Yu Chu, please tell her not to do such a cheap shot or a cheap trick again. I won’t get married according to her wishes.”

Yu Chu’s face was as red as a cooked prawn. Her bright eyes were filled with tears. She shook her head and said, “Brother Ah Zhou, you’ve misunderstood. I know that Teacher invited you over. I’m here today mainly to make things clear! I…”

Yu Chu was about to say something when she realized that the attendant was still here. She said, “Brother Ah Zhou and Second Sister-in-law, let’s go in and talk.”
