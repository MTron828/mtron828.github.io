1523 Plastic Surgery

Shen Mei smiled and nodded. She felt that this was not medicine at all. Instead, it seemed to be a drink.

She took two sips. This medicine tasted good. She finished it all at once.

After Shen Mei finished her medicine, the president smiled and said, “It’s almost noon. Do you want to take an afternoon nap?”

When Shen Mei heard this, she shook her head and grabbed the president’s hand. She asked seriously, “I want to watch television. Is that okay?”

A trace of confusion flashed in the President’s eyes, but he still smiled and agreed. He watched television with Shen Mei.

Usually, Shen Mei would yawn before noon, but now she didn’t seem sleepy at all. She looked very energetic.

The President recalled the tonic Qiao Nian had given Shen Mei to nourish her body. He felt a trace of confusion. Could it be that the tonic had taken effect?

About three hours later, the three of them finally arrived home. They had even had lunch outside.

Qiao Nian asked Chen Qing to rest. Gu Zhou hugged Qiao Nian’s waist and walked upstairs.

Gu Zhou recalled the medicine Qiao Nian had prescribed for Shen Mei and asked in confusion, “What tonic did you give Madam President? It smells very good.”

Qiao Nian smiled at Gu Zhou and said, “Orchid Crane Grass. This medicine has the effect of nourishing the body and calming one’s mind. Moreover, it can detoxify the poison of the Teng Yang flower. It’s just right for Madam President.”

Gu Zhou’s expression faltered slightly. Puzzled, he asked, “I remember that the Orchid Crane Grass is usually found in the country. When did it arrive?”

“When I first took Madam President’s pulse, I realized that something was wrong with her pulse. I got someone to send some herbs over in case of emergencies.” Qiao Nian returned to her room, casually took off her shoes, and sat lazily beside the sofa.

Sunlight filtered through the window and fell on Qiao Nian. Her fine hair seemed to be covered in a layer of golden light, and she looked much gentler.

Qiao Nian poured two cups of tea and handed them to Gu Zhou, who was sitting opposite her. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Gu Zhou took them. He seemed to have thought of something. Looking at Qiao Nian’s face, he asked, “This morning, you got someone to send twenty portions of the Orchid Crane Grass to the palace. Are you still suspicious of Madam President?”

Qiao Nian’s grip on the teacup tightened slightly. Her gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face, and her lips curved up slightly.

The two of them were really telepathic.

Ever since they talked about everything, the two of them could guess what they were going to do to.

Qiao Nian smiled at Gu Zhou and nodded.

A trace of confusion flashed in Gu Zhou’s eyes. He said, “I’ve also seen photos of Professor Shen’s daughter. She doesn’t look similar to Madam President in any way and her facial features are completely different.”

Gu Zhou paused for a moment and continued, “Professor Shen’s daughter has single eyelids, but Madam President has beautiful double eyelids. The shape of her face doesn’t look like hers either.”

Qiao Nian’s fingers gently rubbed the cup in her hand. With a complicated expression, she said, “I suspect that Madam President has undergone plastic surgery.”

Previously, Qiao Nian had only had this thought. On the way back, the more she thought about it, the more she felt that it was possible.

There was nothing about Lina that looked like Shen Mei, but the shape of Lina’s face looked a little like Professor Shen’s daughter.

There was nothing about Lina that looked like Shen Mei, but the shape of Lina’s face looked a little like Professor Shen’s daughter.

If Shen Mei was really Professor Shen’s daughter, then something else must have happened more than twenty years ago, forcing the President to make Shen Mei undergo plastic surgery.

She was very curious about the role of the European president in this matter.

If the president was willing to tell her about Shen Mei’s plastic surgery, she could have an open discussion with him.

If the president wanted to hide the fact that Shen Mei had plastic surgery, she would definitely not be able to get the truth out of him.

If she took the initiative to tell the president about Shen Mei’s plastic surgery, she might alert the enemy.

Therefore, she had suggested looking at Shen Mei’s past medical cases today because she wanted to find out if Shen Mei had undergone plastic surgery. If it was proven, it showed that the president was willing to be honest with her.

If the president still hid Shen Mei’s plastic surgery, the clues might be cut off.

Qiao Nian narrowed her eyes slightly. Today’s tonic was a test. She was very curious if the president would be honest after he knew that the medicine in her hand was so effective.
