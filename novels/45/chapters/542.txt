Gu Zhou’s gaze swept across Qiao Nian. His eyes sparkled as he narrowed his phoenix-like eyes. He was now very certain that when Qiao Nian saw the Lu brothers, she would reveal a different side of herself.

Of course, Chen Qing had also noticed the change in Qiao Nian.

Then, they followed Chen Jun into the car.

When the Lu family and the Gu family left, the onlookers were still looking at the departing car with some interest. Only when the car had completely disappeared did they disperse.

In the car.

Lu Rao snapped his fingers casually, one rhythm after another. His gaze fell on the window. He seemed to be in a daze, but also seemed to be thinking about something.

Lu Zhu asked, “Does Grandma know that I’m injured?”

Lu Rao retracted his gaze and said, “You told me not to tell Grandma, so I didn’t. However, Grandma seemed to know from somewhere else that you were injured.”

“This was really too dangerous. It was really a narrow escape. It’s all thanks to Su… Qiao Nian!”

Towards the end, Lu Zhu lowered his gaze, hiding the disappointment in his eyes.

During his time with Sugar, he had been calling her by her nickname. Just now, he had almost exposed his sister.

Unfortunately, Sugar could not go home with him this time.

Lu Rao sensed Lu Zhu’s abnormality and frowned slightly. He remembered very clearly that his eldest brother only stuttered when he was young. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Lu Rao’s lips curved up slightly. He asked with a smile, “Brother, did I hear wrongly just now? You were stammering just now!”

Lu Zhu looked up again, his eyes cold. Without changing his expression, he asked, “Did Grandma say anything else to you?”

Lu Rao shrugged slightly, looking like he was watching a show. He said, “Grandma asked you to go back and kneel down to reflect on your actions.”

This was Grandma’s usual style.

Lu Zhu frowned slightly. Pretending to be casual, he asked, “Then does Grandma have any intention of blaming Qiao Nian?”

Lu Rao shook his head gently and licked his lips. “It’s not like everyone doesn’t know about what happened between you and Jiang Chi. Grandma doesn’t blame her. Instead, she’s worried that the young lady will be implicated because of you and whether she will be frightened”

When Lu Zhu heard this, he couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

What he was most worried about now was that Sugar had yet to return to the Lu family. The other members of the Lu family might blame Sugar for this and have a bad impression of her.

Now, it seemed that he no longer had to worry about this.

“It’s fine then!”

Lu Rao looked at Lu Zhu with a strange expression. He was slightly stunned. His fox-like eyes narrowed slightly as he asked in confusion, “Brother, you weren’t like this in the past. Previously, your attitude towards Miss Qiao was very bad. Don’t tell me you have other thoughts about Miss Qiao after this incident!”

Lu Zhu and Lu Rao had been brothers for more than twenty years. How could he not understand what Lu Zhu meant?

Lu Zhu was clearly worried that Grandma wouldn’t like Qiao Nian.

At the thought of this, Lu Rao looked at Lu Zhu suspiciously.

Lu Zhu frowned and knocked Lu Rao on the head. He said disdainfully, “What are you thinking?”

Lu Rao leaned back lazily in his chair, the corners of his mouth curving up slightly. There was a hint of a smile in his beautiful fox-like eyes as he pretended to ask casually, “Since Eldest Brother likes her too, why don’t you let her be your sister-in-law? What do you think?”

Lu Zhu’s heart beat faster and faster, and his brow furrowed deeper and deeper. He sat up straight and said sternly, “I’m telling you not to mess around. She’s not suitable for you!”

Lu Rao snapped his fingers lightly and raised his eyebrows provocatively. He crossed his legs and pretended to look at Lu Zhu casually, asking, “Is she suitable for you just because she’s not suitable for me?”

Lu Zhu was speechless.
