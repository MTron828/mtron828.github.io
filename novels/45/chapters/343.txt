Chapter 344: Abandoned

When they left the dessert shop, Gu Qi looked up at Qiao Nian and asked seriously, “Do we look alike?”

Qiao Nian smiled and explained, “Actually, this is a special phrase used to strike up a conversation with others. Just listen to it. What they say isn’t true.”

“Oh.”

Gu Qi lowered his head, inexplicably disappointed.

“Alright, I’ll send you back to school now.”

“Okay.”

Gu Qi walked in front, his expression serious.

Seeing Gu Qi like this, Qiao Nian felt an inexplicable sense of loneliness. Her heart ached for this child. She quickly walked forward and asked softly, “Gu Qi, do you want to give me your DNA so that I can help you find Mommy?”

Gu Qi nodded without hesitation. “Yes.”

He handed his hand to Qiao Nian and asked seriously, “Do you need blood?”

Qiao Nian looked at his fair hands. She couldn’t bear to cut his hands. She shook her head gently and said, “Your nails and hair will do.”

When Gu Qi heard this, he retracted his hand.

Qiao Nian took Gu Qi to a nearby supermarket. She bought a file and a nail clipper, then brought Gu Qi to a nearby park and sat down on a bench.

Gu Qi sat down obediently beside Qiao Nian and placed his hand in front of her.

Qiao Nian pinched Gu Qi’s small fingers and carefully trimmed his nails, afraid that he would cut his hand.

Under the sunlight, Qiao Nian’s hair, which was as brown as seaweed, seemed to have turned golden. Her entire body was bathed in sunlight, as if she was coated in a layer of gold. She seemed to have become much gentler.

The love and gentleness in her eyes became more and more obvious.

Gu Qi looked at Qiao Nian in a daze. For a moment, he even forgot to breathe. He didn’t dare to break the silence. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

In the past, he had fantasized about his mommy cutting his nails. At this moment, he really treated Auntie as his mommy.

However, good times were always short-lived.

After Qiao Nian finished trimming Gu Qi’s nails, she placed them seriously into the document bag. Then, she smiled at Gu Qi and said, “I’ll take this to the forensic department. If anyone goes to look for a missing child, your DNA will be taken out for comparison. If there are any results, I’ll contact you again.”

When Gu Qi heard this, he subconsciously said, “Then can you contact me sooner?”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Qi in confusion. “Huh?”

“I still owe you a hundred dollars. I want to pay you back.” Gu Qi looked up at Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but laugh. This was the first time she had met someone who was so eager to return money. “Okay.”

Gu Qi lowered her head, his emotions complicated. He just wanted to spend more time with her. As long as he owed her money, he would have a reason to meet her again.

Of course, Qiao Nian didn’t know what Gu Qi was thinking. She glanced at the time and smiled. “It’s getting late. I should send you back.”

“Auntie is such a good person. Why would she be abandoned by your mommy?”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Qi’s words, she was slightly stunned. She found it hard to believe that the word “abandoned” came from such a young child.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips slightly. So that was what he had been thinking. Smiling, she said, “Why would you think that?”

Gu Qi subtly touched the nails Qiao Nian had just cut for him and said seriously, “But our mommies abandoned us. Otherwise, how could we not have found her?”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned.

It turned out that no matter their age, everyone would be terrified and uneasy when they couldn’t find their relatives.

Actually, before today, she had also felt that she had been abandoned. However, she didn’t want Gu Qi to feel the same way. He was still a child, and he still had to be filled with hope.

Gu Qi lowered his head and said in a muffled voice, “I’m almost five years old now. Mommy didn’t even look for me.”
