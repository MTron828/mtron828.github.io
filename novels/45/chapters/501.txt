Chapter 502: Hug

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

He tightened his grip, as if this was the only way he could hold Qiao Nian tightly in his arms. Only then would he realize that Qiao Nian was still alive!

Smelling Qiao Nian’s scent, he felt very at ease.

Qiao Nian obediently allowed Lu Zhu to hug her. After a moment’s hesitation, she reached out and gently stroked his back.

At this moment, Qiao Nian felt a warmth on her shoulder.

Her breathing tightened, and for an instant her heart ached.

Those were Lu Zhu’s tears…

Although his tears had turned cold from the wind, Qiao Nian felt that the area they fell on was extremely hot. The heat flowed through her veins and into her entire body.

Her whole body went hot.

Only then did Qiao Nian realize that when Lu Zhu said “sugar”, it wasn’t because he had low blood sugar and needed to eat sugar.

“Sugar, I think that’s her nickname…”

Suddenly, bits and pieces flashed through her mind.

She seemed very small then and soft and squishy. She was sitting at the table and looking at the people around her.

There was a lot of stuff on the table.

Ingots, coins, brushes, pills, sugar, mooncakes, and so on…

With all her strength, she crawled over and simply grabbed the sugar and pills.

“Sister is a little princess. You can’t call her a pill!”

“You guys are being ridiculous. If you let her take these things, what kind of nice nickname can she get?”

“How about Sugar?”

“The aura of the eldest daughter of the Lu family instantly disappeared.”

“She’s our younger sister. She doesn’t need to be imposing. We brothers can protect her. The name is soft and sticky. Sugar, how sweet!”

… .

The images were scattered. She couldn’t make out their faces at all. All she noticed was a boy touching her head.

The boy struck her as the boy who played the piano in her dreams.

When Qiao Nian tried to see those faces clearly, her memories instantly disappeared.

She suddenly remembered something. When she was listening to Lu Nian play the piano, she vaguely remembered that there was a young man who played the piano in her dream.

Originally, she’d thought these were all dreams.

But now she realized that these were realities.

The young man playing the piano was Lu Nian.

“Sugar, how sweet!” This was also said by Lu Nian.

The dreams she’d had in the past had been reality. Things that had happened when she was a child. Things that had been buried deep in her memory.

When she saw Lu Nian, although she was surprised, she did not dare to think in that direction.

At that time, she thought that she was an abandoned person. If not for the fact that she needed to donate blood this time, she would never have known that she was the daughter of the Lu family.

Qiao Nian’s eyes reddened, and her voice became choked. “Brother…”

Lu Zhu hugged Qiao Nian tightly as the past surfaced in his mind.

Back then, when he had a younger brother, he had hoped that his mother would give birth to a younger sister.

He finally had a sister, but he accidentally lost her because his brothers were playful and took her with them to the playground.

Not long after that, bad news came that affected him for more than twenty years…

Qiao Nian could feel Lu Zhu’s body stiffen. She was a little worried about Lu Zhu’s body. She said softly, “Brother, don’t be agitated anymore. Relax…”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s voice, Lu Zhu felt even worse. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Why was he so stupid? Why was he so stupid?

Qiao Nian appeared in front of him a long time ago. She even asked him if they had met before.

Why couldn’t he have thought more about it at that time?

He knew that Qiao Nian looked very similar to Lu Qi and his mother, but he had never thought that Qiao Nian might be his sister.

Perhaps it was because his sister’s death had devastated him. He didn’t dare imagine anything else.

He remembered the video the kidnappers had sent. In it, his sister was tortured beyond recognition as she was crying for her brother.
