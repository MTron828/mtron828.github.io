946 Denial

“Mom,” Qiao Yu interrupted Su Xue and asked seriously, “Was that really the case back then?” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Su Xue nodded eagerly and said, “Otherwise, what else can Mom do with the money?”

Qiao Yu didn’t speak. He looked at Su Xue in disappointment.

No matter what the situation was, he couldn’t accept the fact that Su Xue had sent Qiao Nian to the countryside back then.

At that time, he was young and powerless. He couldn’t fight for Qiao Nian, let alone salvage the situation. The only thing he could do was go to the countryside to accompany Qiao Nian when he was free. He wanted to make up for his mother’s mistake.

It was precisely because of this that Qiao Nian mistook him for Brother White Shirt.

Actually, at that time, he didn’t think too much about it. He just wanted to take care of her more and make her shine.

However, he had never expected Qiao Nian’s first reaction was to leave him when she found out that he was a member of the Qiao family.

He could understand Qiao Nian’s choice and respected it.

Qiao Yu walked out of the hospital. He thought of how Qiao Nian’s innocence had been ruined six years ago, how Qiao Nian had given birth to three dead babies, and how she had been locked up in a mental hospital.

What had Qiao Nian done wrong?

She had done nothing wrong.

The six million yuan she had with her had long been squandered by his mother, who had mercilessly sent her to the countryside to fend for herself.

Due to her beauty and wit, his sister was jealous and always bullied her.

If Qiao Nian had been adopted by someone else, she would definitely have been pampered and taken good care of. She would never have lived such a hard life.

“Mom, if you’re telling the truth, I think you’d better confess to Dad. If there’s anything else you haven’t said, consider it as confessing this time. When Dad finds out what happened back then, you’ll know his temper. At that time, your outcome will definitely be very tragic!”

With that, Qiao Yu quickened his pace without waiting for Su Xue.

Su Xue was stunned for a moment. She stood rooted to the ground and watched as Qiao Yu left. She frowned slightly, her heart in a mess.

No matter what happened, she could only say that her investment had failed and she had lost money. She could not tell the truth.

She could not let Qiao Shan know that she was keeping a gigolo.

As long as Qiao Shan didn’t know about these things, everything would be fine.

At the thought of this, Su Xue hurriedly jogged after Qiao Yu.

… .

At the Gu family villa.

Sunlight filtered into the room through the window.

Qiao Nian sat in front of the desk, dark circles under her eyes. She looked at the things on the computer screen, her frown deepening.

She hadn’t had a good rest in days. She relied on coffee to refresh herself.

She looked at the records she had found on the computer. They were all very simple. They were all things she already knew. All of them were useless information.

Qiao Nian glanced at the bottom right corner of the computer. It was already eight o’clock.

She called Qin Chuan.

After returning from the Red Bar last night, it was too late for her to call Qin Chuan.

At that time, after she gave birth, it was Qin Chuan who hypnotized her. In other words, Qin Chuan should have known that she had given birth to a few children.

“Hello?”

Qin Chuan’s lazy voice came from the phone. He must have just woken up.

Qiao Nian couldn’t be bothered to be polite. She went straight to the point and asked, “I know that after I gave birth, my mental state wasn’t good. I remember that in order to stop me from continuing to be in pain, you hypnotized me, right?”

Qin Chuan, who had been lying on the bed with sleepy eyes, immediately sat up when he heard Qiao Nian’s words. He was wide awake. “You… you remember what happened back then?”

Qiao Nian closed her eyes and leaned back in her office chair. She relaxed and asked, “I vaguely remember that matter.”

“Your memories should gradually recover. Don’t think too hard about it. The memories of the past are really too painful. If you think about them, your mind might collapse. I…”

“I’m a little curious. If I remember correctly, you only helped people forget some memories back then. When did you learn to tamper with your memories?” Qiao Nian interrupted Qin Chuan and asked.

“Eldest Senior Brother taught me.” At this point, Qin Chuan said sternly, “Your current situation is very dangerous. Where are you? I’ll look for you and help you change your memory.”
