Chapter 444: Wedding Night

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian pursed her lips slightly, stunned.

“Mrs. Gu, you’re a little different today. You seem to talk a lot. Are you worried about me?”

There seemed to be a hint of intrigue in Gu Zhou’s voice, as well as a hint of ambiguity. Qiao Nian could feel the temperature in the room suddenly rise.

She was indeed very worried about Gu Zhou’s health.

However, she swallowed her words and asked casually, “When are you planning to go back?”

The other side of the phone froze for a moment. Then, Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou say, “In a few days!”

“Alright, I understand!”

“Yes, I’m hanging up!”

Seeing that Gu Zhou was about to hang up, Qiao Nian was still very worried about his injuries. Hence, she said, “You have to be careful from now on. Don’t do any strenuous exercise, or the wound on your back might open again!”

The man on the other end of the line pursed his lips slightly. There was a hint of ambiguity in his words as he asked, “Madam isn’t even by my side. Who am I supposed to find to do vigorous exercise?”

Qiao Nian’s face couldn’t help but turn red. She recalled Gu Zhou’s pale face last night. Last night, Gu Zhou seemed to be someone she could bully easily. She still remembered the way his collar had been unbuttoned. She could vaguely see his good figure that was seductive.

Gu Zhou was probably not teasing her, but reminding her how the wound on his back had been opened last night.

......

For a moment, Qiao Nian was stunned, not knowing how to answer.

Just as Qiao Nian was deep in thought, Gu Zhou asked solemnly, “What did you tell me this afternoon?”

“What?”

“I wanted to ask you about lunch.”

A trace of surprise flashed across Qiao Nian’s eyes. She had seen Zhou Zhou at noon. Could it be that Gu Zhou already knew about the existence of Zhou Zhou?

Qiao Nian wasn’t sure what Gu Zhou meant. She asked, “Have you remembered something?”

“I had a strange dream at noon.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Qiao Nian asked carefully, “What dream?”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s question, Gu Zhou instantly fell silent. Actually, he wasn’t sure either. Had everything that had happened in the afternoon really happened, or had he been dreaming?

Especially what Qiao Nian had said to him in his dream.

In the afternoon, Qiao Nian had been very gentle and considerate towards him, even coaxing him.

“What’s wrong?”

Qiao Nian’s confusion was transmitted through the phone.

Gu Zhou sat on the spot with his right leg crossed over his left. He said seriously, “It’s nothing. I just dreamed that you were forcing me to consummate our marriage!”

Qiao Nian was shocked.

What?

Gu Zhou actually said such a thing!

She had never expected that the usually serious Gu Zhou would actually act like a hooligan in broad daylight!

Qiao Nian recalled how Gu Zhou had looked when he was injured at noon. She had taken care of him for the entire afternoon, yet he had still acted like a hooligan towards her.

Qiao Nian said angrily, “Haven’t you heard? Dreams are the opposite of reality!”

“Since it’s the opposite, should I be the one forcing you to consummate the marriage?”

Qiao Nian felt a headache coming on.

Who would seriously discuss such a shy topic like the wedding night?

The more Qiao Nian thought about it, the angrier she became. Now, she was completely sure that Gu Zhou was fine. She said angrily, “I’m hanging up!”

With that, Qiao Nian hung up without hesitation.

Gu Zhou could tell that Qiao Nian was embarrassed and exasperated.

Gu Zhou reached out to unbutton his shirt, revealing his sexy collarbone. His gaze landed on his phone, and his eyes lit up when he saw the name on his contact list.

Standing at the side, Chen Qing’s gaze landed on Qiao Nian’s contact.

Mrs. Gu.

Chen Qing was slightly stunned. Second Young Master seemed to have fallen for Second Madam.

Gu Zhou calmly turned off his phone and casually placed it in his pocket. He looked up at Chen Qing and asked coldly, “Have you confirmed it?”
