Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian was here to ruin the blind date anyway. She casually leaned back in her chair. After some thought, she smiled and said, “I’m a very busy person. I sleep, eat, and play games.”

The smile on Li Kun’s face grew even brighter. This was the first time he had met such an interesting and realistic girl.

“Mr. Li, I’m here today to say…” Before Qiao Nian could finish her sentence, she saw Zhao Qian walking in with .tulips in her hands

Qiao Nian frowned slightly. Seeing Zhao Qian approach them, she suddenly recalled that Li Kun had greeted her as “Miss Zhao”. Instantly, she realized that the man in front of her was on a blind date with Zhao Qian.

“Er…” Qiao Nian stood up and said awkwardly,” I’m sorry, I think I’ve mistaken you for someone else. ”

Li Kun looked at Qiao Nian in surprise, disappointment flashing in his eyes.

Zhao Qian walked over, holding a bouquet of tulips. When she saw Qiao Nian, she looked surprised. “Second…”

Li Kun looked at Qiao Nian in surprise, disappointment flashing in his eyes.

Zhao Qian walked over, holding a bouquet of tulips. When she saw Qiao Nian, she looked surprised. “Second…”

Zhao Qian swallowed the words that were about to leave her mouth. Second Brother had been very low-key about his marriage, so many people didn’t know the identity of the Second Young Madam of the Gu family. Deep down, she didn’t want Qiao Nian to be Gu Zhou’s wife either.

“Sister, why are you here?” Zhao Qian looked at Qiao Nian in shock. Qiao Nian quickly picked up the flowers. With an apologetic smile on her face, she said nonchalantly, “I’m sorry, I mistook him for someone else. Go on, go

on!”

As Qiao Nian spoke, she stood up, holding the flowers. She looked around and saw a man sitting by the window. There was a tulip next to his hand.

Indeed, she had made a mistake!

Qiao Nian hurriedly walked over.

Frowning slightly, Zhao Qian watched as Qiao Nian began her blind date with another man. Her gaze fell on Li Kun’s face. Seeing Li Kun staring at Qiao Nian longingly, she smiled.

She didn’t even have to do anything else. This blind date was already ruined.

With this in mind, Zhao Qian no longer felt burdened. She sat down across from Li Kun and said with a smile, “Mr. Li, how do you do!”

Only then did Li Kun reluctantly drag his gaze away from Qiao Nian and onto Zhao Qian’s face.

“I’m sorry,” Li Kun said guiltily, noticing that he had forgotten himself. “Mr. Li, it’s fine. You don’t have to take it to heart. Just treat this as a chance to make another friend, ” Zhao Qian said sweetly, smiling at Li Kun.

Li Kun nodded perfunctorily. He couldn’t help but glance at Qiao Nian again. Then, he remembered that he was on a blind date, and could only force himself to look at Zhao Qian. “Miss Zhao, your family must have urged you to come here, right?” Li Kun said with a smile.

The smile on Zhao Qian’s face didn’t change, but her heart skipped a beat. She understood that Li Kun had most likely only changed his mind after seeing Qiao Nian.

“Grandma wanted me to marry as soon as possible. I’m sorry for making things difficult for you.” Zhao Qian still had a bright smile on her face as she spoke politely. Hearing Zhao Qian’s words, Li Kun secretly heaved a sigh of relief. “Miss Zhao is really as understanding and kind as the rumors say. From now on, we’ll be friends.”

Zhao Qian gave a small smile. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Just now, Miss Zhao called that lady Sister. The two of you…” Li Kun probed.

Zhao Qian looked at Li Kun. As if she had suddenly remembered something, she said, “We’re quite close. She’s my older sister.”

Zhao Qian followed Li Kun’s gaze and saw Qiao Nian sitting opposite a man in his thirties.

Why would Qiao Nian go on a blind date with another man? Could it be that Qiao Nian knew that she would be chased out of the Gu family sooner or later, so she was trying to find a husband beforehand?

At the thought of this, Zhao Qian was overjoyed. She had to tell Grandma and Second Brother the good news. Then, she would see what Qiao Nian would be able to say.

At this moment, Qiao Nian was trapped in an abyss of suffering. All she could hear was the unending rambling of the other man, and she caught herself slowly dozing off..
