Chapter 104: Bastard

Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

The atmosphere grew more and more awkward.

Qiao Xin stood up shakily, mustering her courage to look at Qiao Nian. “Sister, you’re back. Would you like to have a meal at home before you leave?”

Qiao Nian simply couldn’t bear to stay in the Qiao family home any longer. Her entire body was now radiating a frigid aura. Ignoring Qiao Xin’s words, she snapped, “Give me back the Suranne Grass!”

Su Xue sensed the coldness radiating from Qiao Nian. For a moment, she was a little dazed. She felt that Qiao Nian was changing more and more. She was no longer the obedient Qiao Nian she used to be.

She was indeed a bastard child. This willful girl would never mature, not even after a lifetime of raising her. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

A trace of coldness flashed in Su Xue’s eyes.

Qiao Shan had also sensed the change in Qiao Nian. Casually, he slammed the teacup onto the ground and glared at Qiao Nian. He raged, “What are you talking about? How dare you speak to your mother and sister like that?! Do you want me to send you back to the mental hospital? Maybe then you’ll learn

how to speak properly to your family!”

Qiao Nian’s gaze moved from Su Xue’s face to Qiao Shan’s. She snorted and questioned, “In that case, how do you think I should speak to a thief?”

“shut up! You wretch! If we didn’t have your best interests in mind for your marriage, and arranged for you to marry into the Gu family, you would still be stuck in the mental hospital!”

Qiao Shan’s heart ached at the mention of the Gu family. If he had known that Gu Zhou was good-looking, and that he was healthy and had a bright future, he would have asked Qiao Xin to marry into the Gu family. “Since the moment you got home, you’ve been talking about nothing but ‘stealing’. How

does your family owe you anything?”

Before Qiao Nian could speak, Qiao Shan continued, “If your sister didn’t go to the mental hospital, we wouldn’t have known that you were planning to move all the Qiao family’s assets out!”

Qiao Nia

Qiao Nian had never seen such brazen people in her life. This had truly broadened her horizons.

But Qiao Shan himself did not think that there was anything wrong with his words. With a cold expression, he commanded, “I order you to move all of the Suranne Grass in the Gu family home back to our house. As for the green plants in the hospital, move them all back to the Qiao family home as well!”

“Are you dreaming?” Qiao Nian couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

Qiao Shan could hear the disdain in Qiao Nian’s words. He said angrily, “What are you laughing at? Hurry up and move these things back!”

Qiao Nian stood there smiling, her gaze fixed on Qiao Shan, as if she was looking at a performing clown.

Qiao Shan could clearly see the disgust in Qiao Nian’s eyes. He stood up angrily. “Do you not understand the English language? Do you think I’m spouting nonsense?”

Seeing that Qiao Shan had gotten himself worked up, Su Xue glared daggers at Qiao Nian. “Apologize to your father now!”

Qiao Xin was secretly overjoyed, but she pretended to be as pious and innocent as a white lotus. “Sister, do listen to Dad. His heart isn’t well. Don’t make him angry! Hurry up and bring the Suramne Grass back!”

Qiao Nian completely ignored Su Xue and Qiao Xin’s words. Staring directly at Qiao Shan, she mocked, “Aren’t you indeed spouting nonsense?”

Su Xue looked at Qiao Nian in astonishment. She hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to say something so outrageous.

Qiao Shan was so irate that he choked, falling into a coughing fit.

Su Xue hurriedly patted Qiao Shan’s back, attempting to relieve his coughing fit. Her gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face and she said in the tone of an old fogy, “Qiao Nian, don’t anger your father. Hurry up and move the Suranne Grass back home. Let’s forget about what happened today!”

“Wretch! You wretch!” Seeing how unruffled and uncaring Qiao Nian looked, Qiao Shan couldn’t help but rage at her.

“Can you use another insult? I’m sick of hearing that!” Qiao Nian sneered, speaking unhurriedly.

“You… You have no respect for your elders!” The moment Qiao Shan thought of the priceless Suranne Grass, his anger exploded. “You traitorous wretch! Without a word, you just moved everything belonging to our family to the Gu family home!”

“What did you say?” Qiao Nian raised an eyebrow. There was only coldness in her eyes as her red lips opened slightly. “You never gave me a chance to speak. After you threw me into the mental hospital, did you even bother to visit?”

At this moment, both Qiao Shan and Su Xue looked extremely displeased.

At that time, Qiao Shan felt that Qiao Nian was already useless as a chess piece. Thus, he didn’t think of visiting her.

If he had known that Qiao Nian had the ability to cultivate Suranne Grass, he would have brought her back home a long time ago..
