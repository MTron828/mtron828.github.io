Chapter 641: Attention

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on Chen Qing’s face. He asked, “Where is Madam going tonight?”

Before Chen Qing entered, he had thought that he would never have to put up tiles again. Just as he was feeling happy, he heard Gu Zhou’s question. He was so frightened that he immediately stood up straight and stammered, “I-I don’t know…”

“Go clean the bathroom now!”

Chen Qing was speechless.

At this moment, Chen Qing wanted to cry but had no tears. He had come to protect Gu Zhou, but he was doing the cleaning job.

Just as Chen Qing was about to say something, he saw that Gu Zhou had already left.

Chen Qing felt that he must be the most pitiful assistant to the most overbearing CEO in history. Just think about it, which other assistant would put up tiles and wash the toilet?

There was no assistant more pitiful than him. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

After Qiao Nian walked out of Gu Zhou’s office, she went straight to Gu Qi’s room.

At this moment, Gu Qi was squatting in a corner of the wall, wrapping his body in the curtains.

“Little Qi, why are you squatting here again?” Qiao Nian looked at Gu Qi with heartache.

Gu Qi must have suffered a lot in the past. That was why he tortured himself like this when he was alone.

Qiao Nian had a thought. She wanted to take Gu Qi out with her.

However, Gu Qi’s identity was special. If she took Gu Qi out, it would be bad if anything happened.

For Gu Qi’s safety, she could only leave him at home.

Gu Qi looked up at Qiao Nian, his dark eyes sparkling. He had thought that Auntie Nian Nian had already gone out. It was impossible for him to hear Auntie Nian Nian tell him a story tonight.

But he had never expected Auntie Nian Nian to be here.

“Auntie,” Gu Qi greeted softly.

Holding Gu Qi’s hand, Qiao Nian walked towards the bed. She turned to look at the obedient Gu Qi and said with a smile, “Don’t squat there anymore. Your feet will go numb if you squat there for too long.”

Gu Qi nodded obediently, his eyes shining even brighter.

Qiao Nian sat by the bed with Gu Qi in her arms. Just like how she had coaxed Gu Qi to sleep, she told Gu Qi a story.

When the story was over, Gu Qi looked at Qiao Nian reluctantly. He wanted to be with Qiao Nian every moment. He knew in his heart that if that happened, Auntie Nian Nian would be unhappy.

After coaxing Gu Qi, Qiao Nian handed the fairy tale book to Gu Qi, telling him to read it himself.

After Qiao Nian left Gu Qi’s room, she returned to her own room. She prepared to change her clothes and put on some light makeup, preparing to listen to Second Brother’s new song in her best state.

When she was young, she had never expected her second brother to be Mr. Dong Hua. He was her idol.

At that time, she didn’t dare to dream of listening to Second Brother’s new song.

Hence, she took this meeting very seriously.

It was just like how ancient people would take a bath and change their clothes when they valued something.

After Qiao Nian finished packing, it was almost time. She walked out.

Just as she opened the door, she saw Gu Zhou standing at the door expressionlessly.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion. Puzzled, she asked, “What’s wrong? Are you feeling unwell?”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he frowned slightly. He didn’t answer Qiao Nian immediately, but kept staring at her face.

Every time he took the initiative to look for her, must there be something wrong? Or must he not be feeling well?

At the thought of this, Gu Zhou felt a little troubled.

His gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face, and a trace of surprise flashed in his eyes.

Usually, Qiao Nian didn’t wear any makeup. When she didn’t, her face was fresh and beautiful, as if she was one with nature.

That was because after Qiao Nian put on makeup, her skin would become smooth and fair. Her face was fair and flushed, and her beautiful fox-like eyes were charming. One couldn’t take their eyes off her.

Gu Zhou narrowed his eyes, his gaze darkening. He inadvertently lowered his head, his gaze falling on Qiao Nian’s feet.

She was wearing a pair of black high heels today. The shoes were even inlaid with diamonds, shining strangely under the light.

He had rarely seen Qiao Nian dress so seriously.

Seeing that Gu Zhou had his head lowered and wasn’t speaking, Qiao Nian began to panic. Puzzled, she asked, “If there’s nothing else, I’ll leave first?”
