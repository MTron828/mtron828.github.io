Chapter 245: Finding Another Path

“Nian Nian, your violin is really amazing. It looks expensive!”

“Nian Nian, I hope you won’t be angry with me. I was really on your side just now.”

Gao Lin continued speaking. Seeing that Qiao Nian still didn’t seem to want to pay her any attention, she was about to continue when she was interrupted by Wang Xuan.

“In that case, isn’t it all your fault that Nian Nian turned the situation around just now?” Wang Xuan raised her eyebrows slightly. Seeing Gao Lin’s indignant expression, she said, “What are you looking at? Am I wrong?”

Gao Lin was about to retort when she saw Qiao Nian look up. She hurriedly smiled and said, “You’re right. I did offend Nian Nian in the beginning.”

At this point, Gao Lin’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. She said sincerely, “Nian Nian, I really know that I was in the wrong. I know that you’re a beautiful and kind person. Don’t stoop to my level, okay?”

Qiao Nian glanced at Gao Lin and her gaze fell on Wang Xuan’s face. She asked, “Do you hear a fly?”

Wang Xuan laughed out loud. Then, she deliberately tightened her expression and pursed her lips, saying disdainfully, “I heard that. That fly is so annoying. She must have run over after eating shit in the toilet. She’s doing this on purpose to disgust us!”

At this point, Wang Xuan immediately covered her nose with her hand and said pitifully, “This smell is really too unpleasant. Why hasn’t it dissipated? This fly is so annoying. Why hasn’t she left yet? If only there was a fly swatter. I would have killed this fly in an instant!”

After all, Gao Lin was the daughter of a rich family. When she heard Qiao Nian and Wang Xuan’s words, her expression instantly turned cold. She said disdainfully, “Isn’t it just a concert ticket? If you didn’t know better, you would have thought that you were the king of the heavens. You’re looking down on me. I don’t have to beg you to attend Mr. Dong Hua’s concert!”

When Wang Xuan heard Gao Lin’s words, she smiled and applauded. She retorted, “Wow, Student Gao Lin is so amazing. Student Gao Lin is really too ambitious! Student Gao Lin, are you trying to use a branded handbag to exchange for tickets to the concert? As your classmate, I can’t bear to see you fall for her tricks. I have to remind you kindly that Ye Ran is holding a fake ticket!”

How could Gao Lin not tell that Wang Xuan was mocking her? She gritted her teeth in anger and clenched her fists tightly.

Qiao Nian wasn’t the only one in this school who might have tickets. Senior Xia Xue definitely had tickets too!

“Wang Xuan, don’t be too smug. Even if you curry favor with Qiao Nian, you might not be able to attend Mr. Dong Hua’s concert with her!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

With that, Gao Lin turned around and stormed off in her high heels.

Wang Xuan pursed her lips and looked at Gao Lin’s back with disdain.

Seeing Wang Xuan like this, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but laugh.

Gao Lin lowered her head and walked towards Xia Xue’s classroom. Speaking of which, her parents were on good terms with Xia Xue’s parents. Their parents often ate together, and they had grown up together.

Xia Xue knew that Qiao Nian knew how to play “Spring and Snow”. She was the one who had told Xia Xue about it.

With that thought in mind, Gao Lin arrived at the entrance of the snow-covered classroom. She saw a girl walking out of the classroom and hurriedly stopped her.

“Senior, I want to look for Senior Xia Xue. Can you help me call her out?” Gao Lin smiled at the girl.

“Are you looking for Xia Xue? She’s not here. She was just called away.”

A trace of confusion flashed across Gao Lin’s face. She wondered if someone else wanted to get the tickets to Mr. Dong Hua’s concert from Xia Xue.

However, Gao Lin didn’t show it on her face. She asked in confusion, “Senior, do you know where Senior Xia Xue was called to?”

“I don’t know about that.”

“Thank you, Senior. Sorry for disturbing you.”

With that, Gao Lin left in disappointment. She had just walked to the corner when she saw Xia Xue.

Just as Gao Lin was about to run over and greet Xia Xue, she saw a man standing opposite Xia Xue.

Oh my god, what had she seen?

Gao Lin’s eyes widened involuntarily.
