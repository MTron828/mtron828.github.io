1374 Coughing Blood

Lu Qi hesitated for a moment, staring unblinkingly at Qin Chuan. She asked softly, “Really?”

“Yes.” Qin Chuan nodded.

When Lu Qi heard Qin Chuan’s words, she took a deep breath and placed her hand on the front passenger seat.

She only adjusted it a little. She sensed that Qin Chuan’s body had moved down a little. Right on the heels of that, she heard the sound of the stone on the roof of the car pressing down.

Lu Qi’s expression suddenly changed. There were many stones on the roof of the car. As long as she adjusted the seat, the stones would also adjust. Fortunately, she had only adjusted them a little just now, but the sound of the stones rubbing against the roof still made her tremble in fear.

“Continue,” Qin Chuan said in a low voice.

Lu Qi looked at Qin Chuan worriedly. Meeting Qin Chuan’s unwavering gaze, her heart jumped to her throat. She continued to adjust the seat.

Her gaze was fixed on Qin Chuan’s face. Every time she adjusted the height of the seat, Qin Chuan’s body would lower a little, and the falling rocks on the roof would also lower.

Lu Qi was so nervous that her palms were covered in sweat. She looked at Qin Chuan’s face and saw that he was fine. She continued to adjust the seat.

Seeing that the seat was about to reach the lowest point, Lu Qi’s forehead was covered in cold sweat. She took a deep breath and tried hard to remain calm.

In the end, the seat had already reached the lowest position. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

This time, there was no movement on the roof. There was also a gap between Qin Chuan and the roof.

Even though Qin Chuan was not being suppressed now, Lu Qi was still trembling in fear. She looked at Qin Chuan uneasily.

“Senior.” Lu Qi’s voice trembled as she stared worriedly at Qin Chuan’s face. “How do you feel now?”

Qin Chuan lay motionless on his seat. Just as he was about to speak, he coughed up a mouthful of blood, right on the heels of which he began to cough violently, his body trembling.

“Cough, cough, cough…”

“Senior.” Lu Qi was frightened by Qin Chuan’s current state. Her eyes instantly turned red. She didn’t dare to touch Qin Chuan casually and could only ask anxiously, “Are you feeling unwell? Does it hurt especially? I…”

Lu Qi had also learned first-aid measures in school, but now, the conditions were harsh. She had nothing and could not even perform first-aid on Qin Chuan.

“Ahem!” Qin Chuan spat out another mouthful of blood.

Lu Qi looked at the blood and her expression suddenly changed. Her eyes turned red again, and she was so anxious that she didn’t know what to do.

Qin Chuan felt the pain in his body, and his breathing became more and more rapid. His bones must have been broken. Broken bones might have pierced into something, preventing him from breathing normally.

He was like a fish out of water, breathing hard. His mind gradually went blank, and his consciousness gradually blurred. His eyes slowly closed.

“Senior!”

“Senior, don’t scare me. Wake up!”

“Senior Brother, Qin Chuan, how are you?”

…

Lu Qi’s sobbing voice lingered in Qin Chuan’s ears. He slowly opened his eyes. He was really tired. However, he thought about how he might never wake up if he fell asleep and Lu Qi would be left alone.

Qin Chuan opened his eyes and looked at Lu Qi. The pain in his body made him break out in a cold sweat. It took him a long time to get used to it. He said tiredly, “I’m fine.”

Lu Qi was so grateful that tears welled up in her eyes. She leaned over and carefully wiped the blood from the corner of Qin Chuan’s mouth with a tissue. “Senior, the tunnel has collapsed. The police will definitely come to help. We’ll wait for them in the car, okay?”

Qin Chuan’s tone was firm. “No!”

“But you…” Lu Qi looked at Qin Chuan worriedly. Only her phone was still dimly lit. She looked at him worriedly.

Every time Qin Chuan spoke, it took a lot of effort. He pursed his lips and said, “The car looks fine now, but it won’t be able to withstand the next collapse, so we still have to go out.”

Lu Qi looked at Qin Chuan’s firm gaze, and the uneasiness in her heart dissipated a little. She glanced at the back of the driver’s seat. “Senior, I’ll lower the back of the driver’s seat now. See if you can get to the back seat.”

When Qin Chuan heard Lu Qi’s words, he nodded.

Lu Qi was petite. Although there was not much of a gap between the driver’s seat and the front passenger seat, she could squeeze through it.
