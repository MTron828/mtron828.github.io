933 Ingrate

Qiao Xin looked at Lu Zhu in disbelief. Her brain short-circuited for a moment, but she quickly regained her senses.

“Mr. Lu, what are you saying? Qiao Nian is my sister. We’re family.” Qiao Xin wouldn’t tell him that she hated Qiao Nian, much less that she yearned for Qiao Nian to disappear in front of her. She pretended to be innocent and said, “The reason why I agreed to Song Man’s request was because I wanted to be on good terms with her. I…”

Before Qiao Xin could react, she saw Lu Zhu aiming the gun at her thigh. In the next moment, blood spurted from her thigh, staining her silver gown red.

“Ah!” Qiao Xin screamed and fell to the ground, looking helplessly at her bleeding thigh.

She had never expected Lu Zhu to shoot after she had told him everything!

She belatedly covered her injured leg and looked up at Lu Zhu, as if she wanted to ask him why he had fired.

However, when she met Lu Zhu’s disdainful gaze, she instantly did not dare to speak.

Lu Zhu looked down at Qiao Xin. Slowly, he put away the pistol with the silencer.

From Qiao Xin’s reaction just now, it seemed that she didn’t know anything. However, it wasn’t impossible for Qiao Xin to be lying.

Lu Zhu’s eyes were cold as his thin lips parted slightly. “This shot is just to teach you a lesson for what you did six years ago. If you still dare to hurt my sister, the next shot won’t be aimed at your leg, but your head!”

With that, Lu Zhu walked out with an indifferent expression, not even sparing Qiao Xin a glance.

Qiao Xin covered her bleeding thigh with both hands and looked at Lu Zhu’s retreating back in fear. Her face was pale, but her forehead was covered in sweat.

Lu Zhu really wanted to kill her!

Lu Zhu was avenging Qiao Nian.

How was this possible?

How could Qiao Nian be the eldest daughter of the Lu family?

Any girl in the world could be the eldest daughter of the Lu family, except Qiao Nian.

At that time, her mother had personally told her that Qiao Nian was just a country bumpkin, the child of a rich businessman’s mistress. No one wanted her because Qiao Nian was a girl.

Her mother had kindly adopted Qiao Nian.

Qiao Xin’s eyes were filled with hatred.

All these years, Qiao Nian had been living off the Qiao family. Now, she had actually climbed over her head. If it weren’t for Qiao Nian, how could she have been shot?

Qiao Nian was an ingrate who couldn’t be raised well. She was trash!

With great effort, Qiao Xin crawled to the sofa, took out her phone from her bag, and called Qiao Yu.

After the call went through, Qiao Xin’s tears fell uncontrollably. She cried, “Brother, come and pick me up now. I can’t take it anymore. It hurts like hell. I’m at the Red Bar now!”

After Qiao Xin finished speaking, she looked at the blood on the ground. Her head grew heavier and heavier, and she fainted in a pool of blood.

At this moment, Qiao Nian had already returned to the Gu family villa.

Qiao Nian’s car stopped in a parking space at the entrance of the Gu family villa. She looked at the Gu family villa with a complicated expression, hesitating if she should enter.

At this moment, her phone suddenly rang.

When Qiao Nian saw that it was Qiao Yu calling, she frowned slightly and hung up mercilessly.

In the past, she had still been grateful to Qiao Yu. Now that she no longer had anything to do with Qiao Yu, there was no need for her to answer his call.

Just as she hung up, Qiao Yu called again.

Qiao Nian hung up again mercilessly.

Then, Qiao Yu continued to call.

Qiao Nian was annoyed. She picked up the call and placed the phone to her ear.

“What exactly do you want?”

Qiao Yu’s hoarse voice came through the phone. “Qiao Nian, can you let Qiao Xin off? I’ll agree to whatever you want!”

“No matter what, she doesn’t want to let me off. If you have time to tell me this, why don’t you teach your sister well and let her know her place!”

Qiao Yu sighed heavily and said in a low voice, “She went to the Red Bar to see you tonight, but in the end, she called me and asked me to save her. When I arrived, I realized that she had already been shot. Even if she had made many mistakes in the past, why did you have to force her into a corner? Can’t the two of you be even?”
