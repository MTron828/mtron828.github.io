1512 Fear

Seeing Qiao Nian pick up another piece of soil and walk towards her, Annie’s face turned pale with fear. She shouted, “Someone, someone, take her down!”

Although Qiao Nian was young, her boldness wasn’t something ordinary people could learn.

Annie’s reaction just now had already explained everything. There was something wrong with the soil used to cultivate Falling Autumn Grass. Otherwise, Annie wouldn’t have been so frightened that she stayed away from the soil.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on the servant’s face not far away. She said, “Bring over the other pot of Falling Autumn Grass from Madam President’s room!”

The servants looked at the President again. Seeing the President nod, they walked towards Madam President’s room.

A servant brought out the Falling Autumn Grass from Madam President’s room and handed it to Qiao Nian.

Lina looked at Qiao Nian curiously, not understanding what Qiao Nian was doing.

In the end, she couldn’t help but ask, “Nian Nian, what are you doing?”

Lina’s words were also what many people were thinking. Everyone’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face, and they couldn’t wait for her answer.

Qiao Nian gave Lina a look, signaling for her to step back. She raised the pot of Falling Autumn Grass high in her hand and smashed it hard onto the ground.

The president’s expression changed slightly. He took a step forward. This was Madam’s last pot of Falling Autumn Grass. However, when he saw Qiao Nian’s calm expression, he stopped in his tracks and clenched his fists tightly.

Qiao Nian squatted down and picked up another piece of soil. This time, she wrapped the soil in a handkerchief and handed it to Annie again.

Instinctively, Annie took a few more steps back, a trace of fear flashing in her eyes. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Qiao Nian took another step forward, and Annie immediately took a few more steps back.

A cold smile flashed across Qiao Nian’s lips. She looked at Annie and said, “We had a misunderstanding previously. Falling Autumn Grass does have a calming effect. I’ve always thought that Madam President needed Falling Autumn Grass, but now I realize that that’s not the case.”

Qiao Nian smiled. Her gaze fell on the soil in the handkerchief and she continued, “If plants want to grow, they have to absorb things from the soil.”

Annie looked at Qiao Nian in fear, her frown deepening.

Seeing Annie like this, the President’s heart instantly turned cold. If it weren’t for Qiao Nian, he might never have known that there was something wrong with this Falling Autumn Grass!

Qiao Nian looked at Annie sharply, her voice like ice. “Annie, I think the reason why Madam President can’t accept my Falling Autumn Grass is because I didn’t use this soil!”

Sunlight fell on Annie’s face. She was sweating nervously. Her fingers gripped the hem of her dress tightly, trying hard to remain calm.

“Princess Annie, please answer my question first!” Qiao Nian said with a smile.

“Do you want this soil?” As Qiao Nian spoke, she took a step forward.

“No, no. I don’t want this piece of soil. Hurry up and take it away. Do you not understand human language?” Annie was so anxious that she was sweating profusely. She shouted, “Qiao Nian, I’m telling you, leave quickly. I don’t want to see you at all now!”

Annie took a few more steps to the side. Seeing that she was some distance away from Qiao Nian, she heaved a sigh of relief. Hope once again fell on the president’s face. “Uncle, hurry up and chase this lunatic out. If you don’t chase her out, I’ll never provide you with Falling Autumn Grass again. She’ll only harm Auntie here. Do you want to see Auntie die at your hands?”

“Shut up!” The president scolded in a low voice!
