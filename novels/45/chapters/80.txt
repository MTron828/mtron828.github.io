Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

“Grandmother?”

Qiao Nian’s voice rang from outside the room.

Zhao Qian tumed to the side and hurriedly wiped her tears away.

Matriarch Gu smiled. She said happily, “Nian Nian, come in!”

Qiao Nian pushed the door open and entered. She froze when she saw that Zhao Qian seemed to have been in tears.

Zhao Qian’s smile reappeared on her face. She greeted softly, “Second Sister-in-law.”

Qiao Nian smiled in return and closed the door. “Miss Zhao, you’re here too.”

‘When Qiao Nian had got home, she had changed into a white nightdress made of real silk. Her hair was now tied up in a bun, and she no longer looked as charming as she had in public. All that was left was an almost unworldly calm.

“Second Sister-in-law, you don’t have to treat me like an outsider. Just call me Zhao Qian.” Zhao Qian smiled.

“Tm really sorry about what happened at the coffee shop today,” Qiao Nian said with a guilty expression. “I was going to apologize to you specially, but since you’re here with Grandma, I’ll speak to both of you at the same time.”

Qiao Nian felt that Zhao Qian would definitely tell Grandma about the incident. That was why she took the initiative to come clean. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Zhao Qian was slightly stunned. She didn’t expect Qiao Nian to take the initiative to speak up. She quickly shook her head and said with a smile, “Second Sister-in-law, I believe in you. Mr. Li and I are not meant to be together. This has nothing to do with you.”

Qiao Nian looked at Zhao Qian in surprise. She didn’t expect Zhao Qian to say this. Could it be that Grandma had scolded Zhao Qian, so Zhao Qian had no choice but to say this?

“Moreover, Second Sister-in-law, you even deliberately maintained a distance from Mr. Li. That was already extremely considerate of you,” Zhao Qian said with a smile.

Qiao Nian had initially thought that Zhao Qian was arrogant and despotic, but now it seemed that she was actually quite an understanding person.

Since Zhao Qian was being so magnanimous, Qiao Nian couldn’t afford to be petty. She said, “This was my fault from the beginning. Thank you for understanding.”

After thanking Zhao Qian, Qiao Nian looked at Matriarch Gu and said, “Grandma, I went on a blind date today.”

Zhao Qian froze. Slightly stunned, she looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief. She hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to be so straightforward.

Matriarch Gu gave a start. Her eyes turned slightly red.

Although she trusted Qiao Nian, her words made her realize something.

Qiao Nian did not fancy that unfilial grandson of hers, Gu Zhou!

This wouldn’t do!

She couldn’t let such a good granddaughter-in-law get snatched away!

Matriarch Gu shook her head. Clutching her chest, she hurriedly said, “Nian Nian, if you think that Gu Zhou…”

“Grandma, it’s like this.” Worried that Matriarch Gu would fly into a panic, Qiao Nian explained softly, “My best friend was forced to go on a blind date by her family. This man is about ten years older than her. She was worried that the man would humiliate her, so she asked me to go on the blind date in

her stead, and reject that man.”

After that, Qiao Nian explained how she had mistaken Li Kun for the man she had been supposed to meet.

When Matriarch Gu heard this, she heaved a sigh of relief. Satisfied, she hurriedly pulled Qiao Nian to the sofa and made her sit down. “Child, it’s fine if you don’t tell me about such a small matter.”

“Because the blind date was with someone from the Li family, I was afraid that some nonsensical rumors would reach Grandma’s ears, so I came to explain.” As Qiao Nian spoke, she glanced at Zhao Qian for a fraction of a second, from the corner of her eye.

Zhao Qian was slightly taken aback. She had indeed wanted to tell tales, but she had held back when she spoke.

At Qiao Nian’s words, Matriarch Gu glanced at Zhao Qian and shook her head. “If you didn’t tell me about this, I wouldn’t have known.”

Qiao Nian looked at Zhao Qian in surprise. Didn’t Zhao Qian mention this?

Then why was Zhao Qian crying?

Zhao Qian nodded and said, “Second Sister-in-law, don’t worry. I was present at the scene. I can prove your innocence. From now on, no one shall mention this again.”

Qiao Nian smiled. “Grandma, Auntie Zhang has already prepared breakfast. Let’s go down for dinner!”

“Alright, you can leave first. I’ll leave in a while.” Matriarch Gu looked at Qiao Nian with satisfaction. Qiao Nian was indeed the granddaughter-in-law she had painstakingly selected.

“Zhao Qian, what do you think of your Second Sister-in-law?” Matriarch Gu asked with a smile.

“Second Sister-in-law is sincere and upright. I think she’s a very good person!” Zhao Qian said, following Matriarch Gu’s intentions.

Matriarch Gu’s smile became even brighter. She nodded in approval.. “That’s right!”
