Chapter 347: Out of Jail

The two of them turned around. Qiao Xin couldn’t help but smile. She hurriedly ran up to Su Xue and grabbed her hand. “Mom, you’re finally here!”

Previously, Qiao Xin had tried to persuade her mother to pick her father up when he was released from prison.

But at that time, her mother said that she was sorry and refused.

Qiao Xin really hadn’t expected her mother to come in the end. Qiao Xin felt very happy.

Qiao Yu put his right hand in his pocket. He glanced at Su Xue indifferently and retracted his gaze.

Qiao Xin could naturally tell what Qiao Yu was thinking. Frowning slightly, she said unhappily, “Brother, it wasn’t easy for Mom to get here. Why are you still acting like this? It wasn’t easy for our family to be reunited!”

Although Qiao Yu had helped Su Xue resolve the problem, this didn’t mean that he forgave Su Xue for her ridiculous actions.

“We’ve already divorced,” Qiao Yu said coldly. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

When Su Xue heard Qiao Yu’s words, her face instantly turned pale. She didn’t expect her son to look down on her. She instantly felt terrible.

“But…” Qiao Xin looked at Su Xue’s pale face and tried to persuade him gently. “Brother, don’t say that. Besides, Mom already knows her mistake. There’s no need for us to keep harping on this matter. Can you…”

Qiao Yu frowned in disapproval and said, “Xin Xin, the matters of the elders are not for us juniors to discuss.”

When Qiao Xin heard Qiao Yu’s words, she lowered her gaze in disappointment and stopped talking back.

She still remembered the day her father had hit her mother’s lover. That day, the news had spread like wildfire, and she had been too embarrassed to go out again. Fortunately, her brother had used a lot of strength to control the public opinion in the end, so she finally had the courage to go out.

During this period of time, Qiao Xin saw that Qiao Nian’s life was getting better and better. She was even angrier, which made her very dissatisfied.

Qiao Nian had caused her father to go to prison, and her parents to have a falling out. This matter could not be let off easily.

However, what puzzled Qiao Xin was that her brother seemed to be very concerned about Qiao Nian.

When she bought coffee for her brother this morning, she accidentally saw the tickets to Mr. Dong Hua’s concert. Moreover, this ticket had already been used.

She had never expected her brother to pay more and more attention to Qiao Nian, because her brother didn’t like music at all.

At the thought of this, Qiao Xin frowned. Her mood was getting worse and worse.

Su Xue thought that her daughter was unhappy because of her. She comforted her gently, “Alright, Xinxin, don’t be angry. Don’t get angry with your brother because of me!”

Qiao Xin nodded slightly.

At this moment, the prison door opened.

A prison guard sent Qiao Shan out and gave him some instructions before letting him leave.

Qiao Shan tried hard to breathe in the free air, and his mood improved a little.

When Qiao Xin saw Qiao Shan, she ran over happily and called out, “Dad!”

Qiao Yu walked over as well.

Su Xue was left standing alone. For a moment, she didn’t know what to do.

When Qiao Shan saw his son and daughter, he couldn’t help but smile. He gently patted the shoulders of the two children.

Qiao Xin’s eyes instantly turned red. She looked at Qiao Shan worriedly, her heart aching for him. “Dad, you’ve lost so much weight. What did you go through in there? Did they abuse you?”

Qiao Shan clenched his fists tightly. Thanks to Gu Zhou, his days inside could be described as years.

Qiao Yu frowned coldly. He had also gotten someone to make arrangements. Logically speaking, his father shouldn’t have been tortured to this extent.

Qiao Shan didn’t want the two children to worry, so he could only swallow his bitterness alone. A weak smile appeared on his face. “I’m fine. Let’s go home together!”
