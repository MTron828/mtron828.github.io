1322 Goodbye

After Cui Huai left, Gu Yue immediately rushed to the emergency room. Just as he reached the door of the emergency room, he saw Butler Zhao pacing back and forth anxiously.

When Butler Zhao saw Gu Yue approaching, he hurriedly walked forward and greeted, “Sir.”

A trace of anxiety flashed in Gu Yue’s eyes. He asked anxiously, “How’s Chang Feng now? Is he out of danger? What did Uncle Zhang say?”

Gu Yue sent Chang Feng out tonight. He thought to himself that as long as Chang Feng could return safely with them, it would be fine even if Cui Huai suspected him. As long as they did not panic, Cui Huai would not be able to find anything on them.

However, Chang Feng had done very well this time. He had used his injuries to gain Cui Huai’s trust in them.

Chang Feng had done the right thing this time. After Chang Feng and Gu Zhou’s hard work, Cui Huai trusted him without a doubt.

He and Chang Feng had succeeded again.

He wanted to live well and hoped that Chang Feng would live well. He hoped that Chang Feng would witness the moment of success with him.

In the eyes of others, Chang Feng was just his subordinate. He knew in his heart that Chang Feng was his best brother and was as important to him as Gu Zhou.

“I’m not sure what’s going on inside. Uncle Zhang is treating Chang Feng.” Butler Zhao looked worriedly at the emergency room door and pursed his lips nervously.

Gu Yue walked to the entrance of the emergency room. He wanted to see the situation through the gap in the door. After thinking for a long time, he knocked on the door and asked seriously, “Uncle Zhang, can I enter now?”

“No!” Uncle Zhang refused without hesitation.

Gu Yue could still hear the urgency in Uncle Zhang’s words. This was the first time he had seen Uncle Zhang so anxious. His heart tightened and he frowned. Could it be that Chang Feng really couldn’t make it?

Gu Yue did not dare to push the door open and enter. What if his intrusion affected Uncle Zhang’s surgery?

He walked over to the wall and stood there. He took out a pack of cigarettes from his pants pocket and took out one of them. His trembling hand lit the cigarette, and he took a deep drag. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

At the hospital.

Qiao Nian was in a daze when a voice called out to her.

“Nian’er.”

“Nian’er.”

She looked at the man in front of her sleepily. At some point, the lights in the hospital ward had become especially bright. She raised her hand to cover her eyes. When her eyes had adapted to the current light, she opened them.

Above her was the hospital ceiling. The man in front of her had disappeared.

Qiao Nian’s eyes were filled with confusion. She turned to look at Gu Zhou, only to realize that she was the only one on the bed.

“Gu Zhou?”

“Where are you?”

Qiao Nian was about to get out of bed to look for Gu Zhou. Gu Zhou was injured, so he should be lying on the bed.

She had just put on her shoes and stood up when she saw Eldest Senior Brother standing in front of her in a white suit.

Qiao Nian’s eyes lit up. She quickly walked up to Eldest Senior Brother and asked worriedly, “Eldest Senior Brother, why are you here? How’s the wound on your leg? Why don’t I take an X-ray for you? If you need surgery, I’ll arrange for a surgery now!”

“Nian’er.”

Qiao Nian heard that Eldest Senior Brother’s voice was a little hoarse. She had an uncomfortable feeling in her heart. She looked down and saw that Eldest Senior Brother’s white suit was gradually dyed red.

Qiao Nian panicked. She stepped forward to grab Eldest Senior Brother’s hand, but Eldest Senior Brother was clearly right in front of her. No matter how many steps she took, Eldest Senior Brother would stand not far away from her.

“Eldest Senior Brother, what’s wrong?” Qiao Nian looked at Eldest Senior Brother in panic and asked anxiously.

“Nian’er, I’m here to say goodbye to you.” Chang Feng’s voice was as hoarse as ever, but his tone was exceptionally gentle.

“Goodbye? Where are you going?” Qiao Nian looked up at Eldest Senior Brother. She could feel the gentleness in his eyes.

“Goodbye!”

After Eldest Senior Brother finished speaking, his figure gradually faded in front of Qiao Nian until he disappeared.

“Eldest Senior Brother!”

Qiao Nian woke up with a start. She sat on the hospital bed, her face pale. She panted heavily.

Seeing Qiao Nian sit up abruptly, Gu Zhou reached out and took her hand.

Sensing the warmth of Gu Zhou’s hand, Qiao Nian turned to look at him.

“What happened? Why are you covered in cold sweat?” Gu Zhou tried hard to sit up.
