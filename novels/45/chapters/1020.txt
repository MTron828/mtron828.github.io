1021 How is that possible?

“You’re wrong. It’s only right for you to apologize to me and address me respectfully as the eldest daughter of the Lu family.” Qiao Nian paused for a moment and continued, “If I’m really the eldest daughter of the Lu family, I’ll have to trouble Auntie Cao to write the words ‘due diligence’ and ‘making things difficult’ ten thousand times each.”

Auntie Cao frowned slightly, but still nodded. “Okay.”

She believed in Madam’s ability. Back then, Madam had personally done a DNA test on the broken arm. At that time, it showed that the broken arm belonged to Eldest Miss.

Even if the person standing in front of them was really Eldest Miss, she should still be missing an arm.

!!

Therefore, this seemingly calm Qiao Nian in front of her was definitely not Eldest Miss, but an imposter.

Qiao Nian smiled and turned to look at Lu Zhu. “Brother, I remember that when we did the DNA test report, you saved it, right?” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Yeah.”

Lu Zhu nodded. Then, he took out his phone, found the DNA report, and handed it to Matriarch Lu.

Matriarch Lu took the cell phone from Lu Zhu. There were several paternity test reports.

They tested Qiao Nian and Lu Zhu’s blood, hair, and nails.

From the results of the appraisal, Qiao Nian and Lu Zhu were biological siblings. They were born to the same parents.

Matriarch Lu had been emotional previously. When she saw the specific information, she was so excited that tears welled up in her eyes.

Qiao Nian!

Qiao Nian was really her darling child. She was her Sugar, her darling child, and her eldest granddaughter!

When Auntie Cao saw Matriarch Lu’s expression, her heart sank. She could vaguely guess the outcome. She walked to Matriarch Lu’s side, took the cell phone, and looked at the paternity test report. She was stunned.

This?

What exactly was going on?

Auntie Cao’s eyes were filled with confusion, and her face instantly turned pale. Back then, Madam had personally done a DNA test for Miss Sugar. How could there be a mistake?

If Qiao Nian was really the eldest daughter of the Lu family, what had happened to her broken arm back then?

“How… how is this possible? Madam and I have already cremated Eldest Miss’s broken arm, and…” Auntie Cao couldn’t help but begin to doubt if Eldest Miss had three arms back then.

If Song Yu didn’t know the inside story, she might have been as confused as Auntie Cao. Seeing that everyone was looking at Auntie Cao coldly, she hurriedly persuaded, “Auntie Cao, back then, someone might have tampered with the DNA sample. It’s also possible that someone used Sister to clone an arm. Bad people always have all kinds of strange thoughts.”

Qiao Nian thought highly of Song Yu. It seemed that Song Yu was a smart person.

Cloning.

Although Auntie Cao had never been to school and had heard of cloning techniques, cloning humans was forbidden. However, it was really possible to clone an arm.

Only then did Auntie Cao realize that she might have been wrong.

Lu Zhu looked at Auntie Cao coldly and said calmly, “Previously, in MY, I lost too much blood. At that time, Sugar wanted to give me a blood transfusion, but the doctor rejected her because her blood would merge with mine. Such a situation usually only happens between relatives, so she did a DNA test with me! At that time, I acknowledged her as my family when we were in MY.”

Matriarch Lu was originally overjoyed, thinking that her eldest granddaughter was still alive and well. However, when she heard Lu Zhu’s words, her expression instantly turned ugly.

It had been a month since Lu Zhu returned from MY!

“Young brat, you actually hid it from me for so long. Do you still have me, your Grandma, in your eyes?” Matriarch Lu said angrily.

Auntie Cao heaved a sigh of relief and said with a smile, “Since Miss Qiao Nian did the DNA test herself, it’s very likely fake. It doesn’t count.”

Lu Zhu’s expression darkened again. He said coldly, “I knew that someone would definitely jump out to question her, so I took Sugar’s hair and nails and did a DNA test with our Lu family. The results are the same. She’s the eldest daughter of the Lu family!”

Auntie Cao looked at another document. The seal of the Lu family’s paternity test center was indeed displayed on it. She couldn’t believe her eyes.

Was Qiao Nian really the eldest daughter of the Lu family?
