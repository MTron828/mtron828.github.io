991 Is There a Problem With the Children?

“There’s nothing wrong with the children!” Qiao Nian said in confusion, not understanding why Lu Jiang would say that.

Gu Zhou glanced at Qiao Nian and asked, “Is there anything wrong with the children?”

“How can the eldest daughter of the Lu family be someone’s stepmother?” Lu Jiang was furious.

Their eldest daughter of the Lu family could not be wronged.

Lu Qi, who was sitting beside Lu Jiang, finally remembered about the two children. She hurriedly nodded. “Sister, you can’t be a stepmother to others. It’s not easy to be a stepmother.”

When Qiao Nian heard this, she came back to her senses. Smiling, she said, “I gave birth to those two children!”

When Lu Jiang and Lu Qi heard Qiao Nian’s words, their expressions changed slightly.

So these two children had been brought over by Qiao Nian. In other words, Gu Zhou had become a father.

Lu Jiang immediately found Gu Zhou much more pleasing to the eye.

As expected of Brother Ah Zhou. He was so broad-minded that ordinary people could not compare to him!

“In that case, when are you planning to get married?” At this point, Lu Jiang was worried that Gu Zhou would look down on Qiao Nian. “If you treat our eldest daughter badly, don’t blame me for being rude!”

Even if Gu Zhou was happy to be a father, he had to be happy to be the child’s father.

The Lu family had many brothers. They could definitely find a suitable husband for Eldest Miss.

“It’s impossible for me to treat her badly!” Gu Zhou said coldly. “You don’t have to worry about this!”

“Let me tell you, even if these two children aren’t your biological children, you have to take care of them as your own. If you can’t do it, you can say it now. Don’t waste each other’s time!” Lu Jiang said coldly.

Lu Qi nodded in agreement.

“They’re my biological children to begin with!” Gu Zhou frowned. “I’m the biological father of the two children, and she’s their biological mother!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Lu Jiang and Lu Qi were stunned.

Those two children were actually Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian’s children.

What exactly was going on?

Only then did Qiao Nian realize that Lu Jiang and Lu Qi were mistaken. She hurriedly told them about how she and Gu Zhou had been set up for a one-night stand six years ago, how she was pregnant and had children and how they just found out.

Lu Qi looked at Qiao Nian in shock, her eyes red-rimmed. Her sister had such a difficult life outside. Why did the heavens have to give her sister so much suffering?

Lu Jiang looked at Qiao Nian with heartache. Soon, he thought everything through and asked seriously, “If I remember correctly, Brother Gu was in a car accident that day?”

When Gu Zhou heard Lu Jiang’s words, his expression turned serious. A trace of gloom flashed in his eyes. He pursed his lips slightly and said, “A lot of things happened that night!”

That night, Gu Chuan had invited Gu Zhou to An City, saying that he had found someone who could treat Gu Zhou’s illness.

At that time, when Gu Zhou arrived in An City, he was schemed against and got together with Qiao Nian.

Gu Chuan was also on the way to An City. He had gotten into a car accident and his whereabouts were unknown.

Lu Jiang’s frown deepened. He said solemnly, “Looks like someone is deliberately plotting against all of us.”

“Song Man knew my identity and where my child was. She also knows who the father of my child was. I think the kidnapping more than twenty years ago and what happened six years ago are all related to the people behind Song Man.”

Qiao Nian’s expression grew more and more serious. “From this, it can be seen that those people are very powerful. Not only can they touch the Lu family, but they can also touch the Gu family. A family with such strength is definitely not simple!”

“Sister, why did Song Man want to marry Brother Ah Zhou on your behalf?” Lu Qi could not understand what was wrong.

“Song Man must have chosen to commit suicide by jumping off a building to keep those people’s secrets.” Qiao Nian’s eyes darkened slightly. There were too many things to investigate, but she still had no findings. “I’ve investigated Song Man’s background. It’s very simple. She was adopted by her grandmother.”

“Won’t the clues be cut off?”

“I have Song Man’s DNA in my hand and know that I’ve done a bone marrow transplant for her,” Qiao Nian said seriously. “She must have left her hometown when she did the bone marrow transplant. I’ve already gotten someone to investigate where she went during that period of time, but there’s no news yet.”
