825 Cry

Xiao Shi slowly raised her head and looked at Song Man with teary eyes. Her voice was choked with emotion. “Mommy, didn’t you promise me previously that you wouldn’t hit me again? But why did you…”

Song Man’s expression darkened, and her eyes were filled with anger.

The child she had painstakingly raised had been taken away by Qiao Nian with just a few words.

Indeed, blood ties were the most annoying thing in this world! T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Otherwise, Xiao Shi wouldn’t have listened to Qiao Nian.

However, Song Man did not want to cause trouble now. Her tears fell as she said pitifully, “Xiao Shi, Mommy really promises you this time that I won’t do it again…”

Song Man’s tears slowly fell to the ground.

Xiao Shi was stunned. In the past, when Mommy beat her up, she would apologize and repent, but Mommy had never shed a tear.

At this moment, Xiao Shi noticed that there was a clear palm print on his mommy’s face and some blood from her nails.

Oh my god, how did Mommy’s face become like this?

Xiao Shi looked at Song Man worriedly and asked, “Mommy, how can your face…”

She hadn’t finished asking if Auntie Nian had hit her just now.

If she wasn’t wrong, it should be Auntie Nian Nian.

Song Man lowered her head in disappointment and shook her head gently. “Mommy knows that Mommy was in the wrong. It’s only right for me to be beaten up.”

Although Qiao Nian had slapped her quite hard back then, it hadn’t left so many marks. She had secretly scratched the marks on her face with her fingers.

It was to soften Xiao Shi’s heart.

When Song Man saw Xiao Shi’s heart ache, the uneasiness in her heart gradually disappeared.

Although she was angry because her mommy had hit her brother, Song Man was still her mommy. She had raised her since she was young.

Song Man was her only family.

Although Mommy had hit her brother, this did not mean that she was indifferent to her feelings for Song Man.

Xiao Shi hoped to receive Song Man’s maternal love the most.

When Xiao Shi saw Song Man’s tears, her heart softened.

“Mommy, does your face still hurt?”

With tears in her eyes, Song Man shook her head and said, “It doesn’t hurt. It doesn’t hurt at all!”

Xiao Shi pursed her lips tightly, her eyes filled with heartache. Mommy’s face was bleeding. How could it not hurt?

“Your Auntie Nian Nian might be too angry, so she doesn’t know her limits. Don’t worry, my face will recover soon!” Song Man knew that now was the time for her to gain favorability in front of her. Her eyes were red as she pretended to be strong.

Xiao Shi thought of Gu Qi.

She wondered if her brother’s face still hurt.

Song Man raised her hand to touch Xiao Shi’s face and asked gently, “Xiao Shi, it’s really Mommy’s fault for hitting you previously. Does your face still hurt?”

As Song Man spoke, she did not find any palm prints on her face. She frowned slightly. “Your face looks like it’s already…”

Xiao Shi’s face had actually recovered. There were no injuries at all.

Xiao Shi hurriedly retracted her thoughts and said, “Don’t worry, Auntie Nian Nian has already applied medicine for me. My face no longer hurts, and there are no traces of hitting!”

Was there really such a magical medicine?

Song Man couldn’t believe it. Why hadn’t she heard anyone say that some medicine could instantly restore one’s skin to normal?

Could it be that Qiao Nian had used concealer to cover the injuries on her face?

Song Man gently touched Xiao Shi’s face. Only then did she realize that Xiao Shi did not apply any concealer or any makeup.

It seemed that Qiao Nian was really not an easy person to deal with.

She could actually make such a good ointment!

“Mommy, can you stop hitting me in the future?” Xiao Shi looked up at Song Man and asked carefully, her eyes filled with anticipation.

Actually, she was already used to her mommy hitting her. She knew that her mommy was sick and couldn’t control herself.

However, she did not want her brother to be hurt.

She hoped that her mommy could give her a guarantee. That way, her brother would be able to visit her next time, and she wouldn’t have to worry about her brother being beaten up.
