Chapter 1634 Firing Shots

Her parents were no longer around. Why did his brother disappear too?

This meant that perhaps Mark felt that his brother was too old and not easy to control, so he made him disappear.

Hehe.

He didn't know if he was lucky or unlucky. He was young, so Mark had kept him alive to sharpen him into a blade that he could use to stab at others.

Cui Qi's gaze gradually turned vicious. His gaze was like a knife that slashed fiercely at Mark's face.

Ridiculous. This was simply ridiculous. He was the greatest joke in the world.

Mark noticed Cui Qi's gaze and a trace of panic flashed in his eyes. He gripped the pendant on his finger tightly, but he quickly calmed down and put on a calm expression.

Annie was pulled out by the guard. She noticed the killing intent coming from Cui Qi and gradually woke up.

Cui Qi. Cui Qi knew many things about his father.

Could it be that Qiao Nian was telling the truth? Was Cui Qi really planning to tell everyone about everything her father had done?

She looked at Cui Qi. She had interacted with Cui Qi for more than ten years, so she knew every look in his eyes very well.

Annie's gaze changed. She took out the pistol at the guard's waist, her eyes filled with killing intent.

She had to protect her father. She could not let him be hurt in any way!

With this thought in mind, Annie gripped her pistol tightly and fired two shots at Cui Qi without hesitation.

"Be careful!"

The gunshots rang out at the same time as Qiao Nian's. Everyone present was stunned and stood rooted to the ground.

The guard standing beside Annie hurriedly restrained her and snatched the gun from her hand.

There were a total of six bullets in this gun, and five of them were used.

Just now, Cui Qi had been completely focused on Mark. He hadn't expected Annie to shoot him directly. By the time he realized that something was wrong, he had already been shot. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He dodged the first bullet, but he was hit by the second.

Qiao Nian quickly ran towards Cui Qi and subconsciously covered his bleeding chest with her hand. Although her method of resuscitation was skillful, Cui Qi was bleeding too much. Blood still flowed out between her fingers, instantly staining his prison uniform red.

The president was also stunned just now. He did not expect Annie to shoot Cui Qi in public. When he walked over, he saw Cui Qi lying on the ground in pain, blood flowing everywhere.

The president's eyes instantly turned cold. He looked at Annie, who was pressed to the ground by the guards, and questioned angrily, "What are you doing?"

Annie smiled coldly and raised her eyebrows slightly. She looked at Cui Qi not far away and said crazily, "Uncle, can't you understand? I'm just cleaning up the trash!"

The president's expression instantly turned ugly.

"He's just a general who can't even handle a small matter. He doesn't deserve to live in this world. I asked him to kill Lina, but in the end, he failed. This kind of trash should be cleaned up, shouldn't it?" Annie tried hard to stand up. Her gaze fell on the president's face. "The appearance of such trash in front of me is simply polluting my eyes."

"You… you're too impudent!" The president's eyes darkened. He hadn't expected Mark to have such a loyal daughter who was willing to take all the blame.

Qiao Nian had been pressing the bleeding wound for Cui Qi. She looked up at Chen Qing, who had rushed over, and hurriedly said, "Send him to the hospital for emergency treatment!"

Chen Qing nodded and hurriedly called for the people he had brought to carry Cui Qi out. However, Cui Qi was no longer breathing.

Just as Chen Qing was about to leave, Qiao Nian quietly placed something in his pocket.

Chen Qing was stunned for a moment, but he quickly reacted. He nodded slightly and left.

Annie just realized that Cui Qi was no longer breathing. She smiled wantonly, but as she smiled, tears streamed down her face.

"This is great. This is really great." Annie's voice was teary. Her eyes were red as she glanced at Mark, who was not far away. Afraid that she would be discovered, she hurriedly looked away. "Don't you think it's funny that you're sending a dead person to the hospital for emergency treatment?"
