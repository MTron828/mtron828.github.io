Chapter 173 Calling

Qiao Nian wanted to know if her biological parents were still alive.

If they were no longer around, then as their daughter, she should offer incense to her parents’ graves.

If they were still around, then all she wanted to know was why they hadn’t come looking for her. Why had they left her alone…

At the thought, Qiao Nian took out her phone and made a call. Her voice was as cold as ice. “I want all the information on Qiu Nan from Feng Yun Gym.”

Since she had already confirmed the suspicion that she was no relation of Su Xue’s, it was time for Su Xue’s extramarital affairs to be exposed.

At this moment, Qiao Nian’s phone began to ring. She picked it up and glanced at the caller ID. It was Su Xue.

A trace of coldness flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes. She picked up the call and placed the phone to her ear. She said coldly, “Why are you looking for me?”

“Were you the first speaker at the Second Academy of Medicine?”

Su Xue’s voice was full of disbelief.

“Yes,” Qiao Nian answered impassively.

After that, Su Xue hung up!

Qiao Nian sneered. Su Xue’s thoughts were not difficult to guess. While she had attended the speech ceremony as a lecturer at the Second Academy of Medicine, Qiao Xin had only managed to attend as a member of the audience, and only as Qiao Yu’s plus one.

Qiao Yu…

Qiao Nian’s beautiful fox-like eyes narrowed and her expression turned serious.

She was sure that nothing good would come from Qiao Yu’s return visit this time round.

When Qiao Nian returned to her room, she received the information on Qiu Nan she had requested. She read it carefully, then used her phone to call Qiu Nan.

Qiao Nian had studied voice acting in the past. When the call went through, she imitated Su Xue, putting on a fawning, pretentious manner as she spoke. “Nan Nan.”

“Sister Xue?” Qiu Nan was slightly stunned. He continued, “When did you change your phone number?”

“Sigh, Qiao Shan checked my phone. I was afraid that he would suspect me, so I bought another phone and SIM card.”

“Ah, my god! They won’t find out, will they?” Qiu Nan said in fear.

Still imitating Su Xue, Qiao Nian said in a nasally voice, “Don’t worry. I told you that you were just one of my clients. He’s so stupid that he didn’t even give it a second thought. But don’t call that number for the time being.”

Upon hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Qiu Nan clearly heaved a sigh of relief. His guard fell. “Sister Xue, you haven’t come to visit me in a long time. I miss you so much. My little brother misses you too!”

When Qiao Nian heard this, she almost threw up. She gritted her teeth and said in a girlish voice, “Nan Nan, I miss you too.”

As Qiao Nian spoke, she continued to browse through Qiu Nan’s information. Qiu Nan had been obsessed with gambling these past few days, but his luck hadn’t been good. He was bankrupt.

To Qiu Nan, Qiao Nian’s phone call was a lifesaver, because all Qiu Nan could do now was get money from Su Xue.

Hence, Qiu Nan would never doubt whether the person speaking was truly Su Xue. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Nan Nan, that old fogy will be going on a long trip tomorrow. I miss you so much. I’ve already booked a suite at the Huangtian Hotel. I want to spend a wonderful time with you. By the way, in order not to arouse suspicion, I’ll get someone to send you the room card. When the time comes, you can go over first. I’ll go over later, okay?”

“Okay, okay. Sister Xue, when the time comes, I’ll definitely give you a big surprise. Wait for me!” Qiu Nan said excitedly.

Qiao Nian was about to throw up, but she still pretended to be joyful. In the same sweetly girlish voice, she said, “Yes, Nan Nan, I will miss you very much today. I’m looking forward to the surprise tomorrow!”

“Sister Xue, I love you. See you tomorrow!”

“See you!”

With that, Qiao Nian hung up and heaved a sigh of relief. She picked up a cup and took a sip of water. Only then did she feel a little better.

However, when Qiao Nian turned around, she saw Gu Zhou standing at the door with a cold expression, staring unblinkingly at her.

Qiao Nian was shocked, but she didn’t let it show on her face. Her lips parted slightly.
