Chen Qing returned the phone to Gu Zhou. His heart was in a mess, and he frowned. “Then the information we found previously is fake?”

“It seems that he already knows that I’m investigating him and deliberately released fake news.” Gu Zhou’s face was gloomy and his voice was cold.

“Does that mean the young master doesn’t need us to find him?”

However, what Chen Qing did not understand was that if Eldest Young Master wanted Second Young Master to die, why did he send Chang Feng to protect Second Young Master?

When Young Master came here that night, he was already seriously injured.

If the news of Second Young Master being injured were to spread, the enemies of the Gu family would definitely chase after Second Young Master and not let go of any opportunity to kill him.

Therefore, Chen Qing felt that the Eldest Young Master was protecting the Second Young Master now.

Gu Zhou frowned slightly. He remembered that someone was following him at the airport.

At this moment, a group of women suddenly appeared. Then, the police arrived.

Gu Zhou took advantage of this opportunity to escape danger.

Now that he thought about it, it all seemed very coincidental.

There were no coincidences in this world. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

There was only careful planning.

So Big Brother had been secretly protecting him?

But how could that be?

Gu Zhou frowned even more. He did not believe that his brother would be so kind.

Not only did Gu Zhou not believe it, but even Chen Qing found it unbelievable.

Gu Zhou put his phone back into his pocket. His phoenix-like eyes narrowed slightly to hide the complicated emotions in them. He said indifferently, “Let’s go to the north again.”

Chen Qing knew that he could not persuade Gu Zhou. The only thing he could do now was to protect Gu Zhou and not let anything happen to him again.

“When do we leave, Second Master?”

“Now.”

With that, Gu Zhou walked to the door of the ward and pushed it open. Lu Zhu had yet to wake up. Qiao Nian sat quietly by the side, keeping watch.

Seeing that Gu Zhou’s expression had returned to normal, Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief.

Gu Zhou said indifferently, “Chen Qing and I have something to do. I’ll leave this to you.”

Qiao Nian stood up and nodded. “Okay.”

However, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but frown. Although she didn’t know what Gu Zhou was going to do, she vaguely felt that what Gu Zhou was going to do was related to that man in black.

Recalling the injury on Gu Zhou’s back, Qiao Nian said worriedly, “Be careful.”

Hearing this, a faint smile appeared on Gu Zhou’s tightly pursed lips, but it quickly disappeared. His gaze landed on Qiao Nian’s face, and it gradually became deep. He asked in a low voice, “Is Mrs. Gu worried about me now?”

Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat.

Gu Zhou’s gaze gradually turned cold, and his voice became much more serious. “Don’t worry, I’ll be fine. It’s just that you can’t leave the hospital casually. You have to be careful and protect yourself. I’ve arranged some bodyguards for you.”

Qiao Nian nodded obediently.

Gu Zhou did not say anything else. He closed the door and left.

Qiao Nian retracted her gaze from the door and looked at Lu Zhu’s face again. His eyelashes fluttered slightly, and his eyes slowly opened.

Their eyes met.

Gu Zhou had already left with Chen Qing, leaving only the two of them in the ward.

Qiao Nian’s heart couldn’t help but race. Now was the best time for her to acknowledge her brother.

Qiao Nian finally calmed down and asked softly, “You’re finally awake. How do you feel now?”

Lu Zhu noticed Qiao Nian’s nervous and uneasy gaze. This was a completely different person from her usual aloof self. She seemed to have a lot on her mind.
