When Qiao Nian heard their words, she couldn’t help but laugh out loud. Smiling, she teased, “Now that you mention it, it’s like I’m giving orders. I feel bad.’

Gu Zhou crossed his right leg over his left. Compared to Qiao Nian’s embarrassment, he was very calm. He said, “Ah Nian and Lu Zhu, you have more important things to do.”

Hearing Gu Zhou’s rude words, Qiao Nian elbowed him, as if to say, “Why aren’t you polite at all? You’re even asking my brothers to do this and that!”

Lu Zhu and Lu Nian exchanged glances and immediately sat up straight. Lu Zhu said bluntly, “Ah Zhou, you’re at Sugar’s parents’ house. Shouldn’t you change your words and not call us by our names directly? It seems a little rude.’

Gu Zhou was speechless.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

All of the Lu family members were as smart as foxes and were not easy to deal with at all.

It was rare for everyone to see Gu Zhou suffer. One by one, they suppressed their laughter.

Seeing Gu Zhou like this, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but laugh. She teased, “Looks like as long as my brothers use their identities as my brothers, they can suppress you directly.”

Gu Zhou retracted his gaze and looked at Qiao Nian beside him. He moved slightly closer to Qiao Nian’s ear and said in a low voice, “As long as I suppress you, everything else doesn’t matter.”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she thought about how Gu Zhou’s personality would be able to suppress her. However, when she met Gu Zhou’s eyes, she somehow recalled what happened in bed every day. The tips of her ears turned slightly red.

The pressure he was talking about… In addition to his oppressive personality, there was also physical pressure, right?

Qiao Nian silently looked away.

Gu Zhou retracted his gaze from Qiao Nian and looked at the four people sitting opposite him very calmly. He greeted, “Eldest Brother and Second Brother.’

When Lu Nian heard Gu Zhou call him that, he couldn’t help but tense up. He felt that something was wrong.

“Third Brother and Fourth Brother.” Gu Zhou retracted his gaze.

The more Lu Nian listened, the more awkward he felt. He smiled and said, “Forget it, I’m really not used to it. All these years, I’ve always called you Second Brother. We’ve been separated from Sugar for so many years. How about this, we’ll just use what is comfortable to us.”

Lu Rao nodded in agreement. It sounded good to let Second Brother Gu call him Brother, but it felt strange.

Lu Jiang felt the same way.

The few of them chatted and laughed, but they still changed the topic to serious business.

Lu Zhu retracted his smile and asked seriously, “Is there anything else you need us to do?”

This matter concerned the safety of everyone in the Lu family. Everyone was very concerned about this matter.

Gu Zhou lowered his legs and sat up straight. With a serious expression, he said, “There are still spies in the Lu family. You have to find out about this as soon as possible. If this drags on, I’m afraid…”

Gu Zhou did not say the rest. Everyone’s expressions were very serious.

A spy.

If there were still spies in the Lu family, it would be too terrifying. It had to be known that they had spent a long time screening before they selected these servants.

Enemies in the open were not terrifying. Enemies hiding in the dark were the most terrifying.

This matter was very difficult. Firstly, it would be very difficult for them to find the mole in the family. Secondly, even if they really found the mole, they might feel very uncomfortable because that person was definitely someone they believed.

Auntie Cao’s face flashed across Qiao Nian’s mind. Her beautiful fox-like eyes were slightly narrowed, and there was a cold glint in them. She said, “Everyone still remembers what happened to Qi Qi previously, right? This spy must have always been on the enemy’s side. She’s a sharp blade. If she takes action, I’m afraid the entire Lu family won’t be able to escape.”

After a pause, Qiao Nian continued, “This person should have stayed at home for a long time, so no matter how many years they have been in the Lu family, we should investigate carefully. After all, other than our own family, they can’t be trusted.”

When the four brothers heard Qiao Nian’s words, they felt a little uncomfortable. They all knew who Qiao Nian was referring to.

Lu Nian’s voice was cold, piercing through the window paper Qiao Nian had vaguely mentioned. It was as if he was doing business and was extremely unreasonable. “We’ve already investigated all her previous relationships. She’s just an ordinary person. When she entered the Lu family back then, you weren’t even born..
