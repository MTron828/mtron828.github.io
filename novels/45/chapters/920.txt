921 Old Man Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

In the end, she didn’t know where Qiao Nian had gone. The rest had nothing to do with her.

The only thing Qiao Xin was sure of was that at that time, she had drugged Qiao Nian. Qiao Nian was pregnant with a stranger’s child, so she lost her mind and was sent to a mental hospital.

Qiao Nian had brought this upon herself.

Not only did she have her brother, but she also had Song Man as her backer. Qiao Nian would never attack her.

Moreover, Lu Zhu would arrive soon. When the time came, she would personally tell Lu Zhu Song Man’s identity. Qiao Nian would definitely be hated by the Lu family.

“What else did you do?” Qiao Nian asked coldly.

“You already know the rest. Do you need me to tell you?” Qiao Xin asked in confusion.

“Tell me everything in detail!”

Qiao Xin wasn’t afraid of Qiao Nian either. She couldn’t stand Qiao Nian being so straightforward and arrogant. She said angrily on purpose, “Actually, I didn’t do anything. I just brought an old man to your room!”

Old man?

Qiao Nian frowned imperceptibly, but she quickly regained her composure. She couldn’t remember seeing the old man that night.

“Sister, I’ve treated you well too. I was afraid that you would be in pain for the first time, so I found an experienced old man to serve you. Now, it seems that I’m not wrong at all. You’ve been thinking about him for so many years! Don’t tell me you’ve fallen for him!”

Qiao Nian smiled and asked, “Qiao Xin, are you sure that old man entered my room?”

“What else could it be?” Qiao Xin said innocently. “At that time, he told me himself that you were the one who spent the night with him. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have given him the final payment! Don’t you think so?”

Qiao Nian no longer wanted to dwell on what had happened that night. After all, the DNA report she had with Gu Qi had already indicated that the person that night was Gu Zhou.

As for who the old man Qiao Xin had found was sleeping with, she didn’t care at all.

She had already thought of a way to make Qiao Xin regret it.

Moreover, she had come this time mainly to ask about another matter. That matter was also very important to her.

Qiao Nian’s expression instantly turned cold. She asked, “The night I gave birth, what did you and Su Xue do to me and my children? Why did you say that my children were dead?”

Her children were clearly still alive. She did not understand why one child had been sent to Song Man and the other to Gu Zhou.

If she remembered correctly, when Gu Zhou found Wang Lin, she was already on the verge of death. The child was lying beside her.

Who had sent her child away?

When Qiao Xin heard Qiao Nian’s words, she looked confused. Frowning, she asked in confusion, “Have you forgotten? At that time, you gave birth prematurely, so you couldn’t even save your children!”

Qiao Nian looked at Qiao Xin’s face. Qiao Xin didn’t seem to be lying.

What exactly had gone wrong?

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze, deep in thought.

Qiao Xin looked at Qiao Nian in confusion. She walked up to Qiao Nian and asked, “Qiao Nian, don’t you remember?”

Qiao Nian looked up at Qiao Xin, scaring her so much that she took a step back.

“I just want to know what you and Su Xue did to me when I gave birth. I have a bad temper and my patience is limited. You’d better tell me the truth!”

Qiao Xin frowned. She looked at Qiao Nian as if she was looking at a stranger. Then, she sighed and said speechlessly, “Qiao Nian, can you use your brain? What can we do to you?”

Qiao Nian didn’t speak. She just stared coldly at Qiao Xin.

Qiao Xin continued, “Although it’s not good for the Qiao family that you got pregnant out of wedlock, Mom has been hiding this from the outside world in order to help you hide your ugliness. If we really want to do something to your children, do you think your children can grow up in your stomach? Although they were born prematurely, they were only born about ten days earlier. It’s the same as being born after a full term!”

Qiao Nian didn’t speak. Her frown deepened. Qiao Xin was right. At that time, Su Xue had indeed never had any designs on her children.
