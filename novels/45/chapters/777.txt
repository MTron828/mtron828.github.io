778 I Don’t Know This Question!

Qiao Nian smiled and agreed, but she sighed silently in her heart, not letting Matriarch Gu know.

Matriarch Gu smiled and took Qiao Nian’s hand, talking about her latest gown design.

…

In the study.

Xiao Shi took out an exercise book and pointed at an application question on it. She read, “The school organizes students to go on spring outings. If there are only 40 people in each bus, there will be 30 people left. If there are 45 people in each car, everyone will have a seat. How many bus there are?”

When Gu Zhou saw this question, he was slightly stunned.

Was this really a kindergarten question?

Had the questions in kindergarten already begun to become so difficult?

Xiao Shi pointed at the questions in the exercise book and said seriously, “Daddy, I don’t understand this question!”

Gu Zhou lowered his eyes slightly, thinking about how to explain this question in a simple way.

Xiao Shi looked at Gu Zhou seriously and said, “Daddy, you don’t know this question too?” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Although this exercise book belonged to Brother Xiao Qi, she knew how to answer this question because she studied hard at home.

She asked her father because she wanted him to spend more time with her. “Daddy, if one of the passengers is pregnant, do you think the pregnant woman is one or two people?”

Gu Zhou was speechless.

Seeing that Gu Zhou was silent, Xiaohou continued, “If the pregnant woman is pregnant with twins, does that count as one person or three?”

Gu Zhou looked at Xiao Shi in surprise. This was the first time he had heard Gu Qi say so much.

“Daddy, don’t you think I’m right?” Xiao Shi looked at Gu Zhou seriously and asked.

Gu Zhou didn’t know what to say. He felt that Gu Qi was completely different from before.

In the past, Gu Qi was a man of few words and did not like to speak. He was usually cold.

But the current Gu Qi was lively and cheerful.

Gu Qi rested his chin on his hand and raised his eyebrows slightly. He looked extremely adorable.

In the past, Gu Qi was a cold and handsome little boy. Now, Gu Qi was a cute little boy.

It had only been a morning since he had last seen his son. Why had Gu Qi’s temperament changed so much?

Of course, Xiao Shi didn’t know what her biological father was thinking. She even looked at Gu Zhou expectantly, waiting for him to praise her for being smart.

However, her father did not speak. He continued to look at her coldly.

Xiao Shi blinked and asked expectantly, “Daddy, was I wrong just now? The person who set the questions didn’t consider so much, right?”

Of course, Xiao Shi knew that she was wrong.

This question was about the people sitting in a bus. The child in the pregnant woman’s stomach could not sit alone.

If she didn’t look for problems in other aspects, how could she get close to her father and speak to him?

If she knew this question, how would her father tutor her?

Of course she had to pretend not to know!

Gu Zhou glanced at the question and said seriously, “This question refers to the number of people in every bus. In other words, every seat has to be occupied. If there’s a pregnant woman, she can only sit in one seat, right?”

Xiao Shi rested her chin on her hand as her gaze fell on the exercise book. She did not answer immediately. After some thought, she nodded obediently and said, “Daddy, you’re really amazing. You even know this!”

When Gu Zhou heard Gu Qi’s praise, his lips curved up involuntarily!

Gu Zhou continued responsibly, “Actually, we can set a total of X cars for this equation first.”

At this point, Gu Zhou hesitated and asked seriously, “Do you know what this means?”

Xiao Shi nodded and said, “I understand. It’s algebra. Daddy, am I especially amazing?”

Gu Zhou nodded. He had been worried that Gu Qi wouldn’t understand these things, so he had thought that he would teach him more. Since Gu Qi already knew the basics, he would continue to tutor him.

“The key to solving this question is that you need to formulate equations, and equations represent an equality between mathematical formulas…” Gu Zhou took out a piece of paper and wrote down the steps to solve the problem as he explained seriously.
