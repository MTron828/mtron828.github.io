1126 Blowing Up the Family?

Just as Jiang Chi was feeling puzzled, Qiao Nian’s voice rang out again. “Jiang Chi, are you there?”

When Jiang Chi heard Qiao Nian’s voice, he frowned. Qiao Nian’s voice was so gentle when she spoke to Lu Qi. Why was she so serious when she spoke to him?

“He’s here.”

The speaker was Qin Chuan.

“Jiang Chi, you’re not allowed to touch a hair on my biological sister, Lu Qi!” Qiao Nian’s voice rose, her tone filled with anger. “If you dare to hurt her, I’ll get someone to blow up your ghost city!”

Jiang Chi frowned so hard that he could squeeze a fly to death!

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian had gone too far!

At that time, in order to save Qiao Nian and Lu Zhu, Gu Zhou had driven tanks to surround his ghost city and even threatened to blow it up!

Now, for Lu Qi, Qiao Nian was so angry that she wanted to blow up his ghost city.

How could this couple have such a bad temper? Why did they want to blow up his house at every turn?

Just as Jiang Chi was about to flare up, he heard Qiao Nian say, “I promised to help you investigate the cause of Jiang Cheng’s death. I’ve already found clues. Wait for me to return.”

This time, Qiao Nian’s voice softened a lot.

Jiang Chi’s frown relaxed. Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian were really carved from the same mold. They slapped people first, then gave them candy.

However, this candy was what Jiang Chi wanted the most.

Jiang Chi replied indifferently, “Okay.”

Hearing Jiang Chi’s answer, Qiao Nian hung up mercilessly!

Jiang Chi still remembered Qiao Nian’s beautiful eyes and her devastatingly beautiful face.

What a pity.

She was married!

However, it had been a long time since he had seen Qiao Nian!

Jiang Chi raised his hand indifferently, and his bodyguards immediately put away their guns.

Qin Chuan glanced at the mercenaries beside him and said, “Alright, all of you can leave!”

“Yes!”

After the bodyguards and mercenaries left, only Jiang Chi, Qin Chuan, and Lu Qi were left in the room.

With so many people in the private room just now, the air had thinned.

Now that the private room was larger, Lu Qi heaved a sigh of relief. She placed her hand on her chest, still having lingering fears.

She finally recovered. When she looked up, she saw that blood was still flowing from the wound on Qin Chuan’s cheek. She said worriedly, “Mr. Qin, your… your face is injured. I…”

When Lu Qi saw Qin Chuan looking over, she immediately became nervous and said shyly, “Why don’t I help you bandage it?”

When Jiang Chi heard Lu Qi’s words, he frowned.

Seeing the worry in Lu Qi’s eyes, Qin Chuan shook his head gently and said, “There’s no need. We’ll deal with it when we get back.”

“Oh,” Lu Qi replied obediently, but she couldn’t help but look at Qin Chuan.

At the thought that Qin Chuan was injured because he was protecting her, she felt very guilty.

What if the wound on Qin Chuan’s face left traces? Would he be disfigured?

His sister seemed to be very familiar with him. Were the two of them friends?

Three hours later, Gu Zhou’s helicopter stopped in An City.

Qiao Nian immediately got out of the plane and walked out of the airport. Gu Zhou followed closely behind her.

Outside the airport, a car was parked. Qiao Nian glanced at the license plate number and got in with Gu Zhou.

Chen Qing had called this car over for them on the plane.

After Qiao Nian gave him the address, she gripped her bag tightly. There was still Jiang Cheng’s diary in it.

This time, when she went to MY, she wanted to give Jiang Chi the diary from Jiang Cheng, but she did not expect him to not be around!

She had never expected Jiang Chi to have designs on Lu Qi. At the thought of Jiang Chi’s unpredictable personality, her frown deepened.

Seeing Qiao Nian’s pale face, Gu Zhou knew that she was worried about Lu Qi. He reached out and held Qiao Nian’s small hand, interlocking his fingers. He comforted her softly, “Don’t worry, Qin Chuan is still here. Lu Qi will be fine.”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she nodded distractedly. “I hope she’s fine.”

Chen Qing drove even faster. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

In less than twenty minutes, the car stopped at the entrance of Venus Cafe.

There were many people standing around the cafe. One by one, they looked curiously at the bodyguards and mercenaries standing at the entrance of the cafe. No one dared to speak.

Qin Chuan had probably surrounded the entire cafe long ago!

As expected of Old Qin. Well done!
