1196 Godfather

The two of them had grown up together. Before Qiao Nian appeared, she was the woman closest to Brother Ah Zhou.

Thank you readers!

Jiang Yue smiled and looked at Boss Jin sweetly. She said coquettishly, “Godfather, when I was working in the Gu family, Second Young Master Gu had yet to be by Matriarch Gu’s side. That’s why he doesn’t know me!”

When Boss Jin heard Jiang Yue’s words, he was instantly enlightened. He had only wanted to get closer to him just now, but he had forgotten that Second Young Master Gu had only come to Matriarch Gu’s side later. “I see!”

“Godfather ~” Jiang Yue called out sweetly. Her voice made Boss Jin’s bones go limp.

Boss Jin smiled at Jiang Yue and said gently, “What’s wrong?”

“Didn’t you say that you wanted to get an imperial jade? Let’s go take a look at those stones now.” Jiang Yue took Boss Jin’s arm and smiled flirtatiously. “I’m still waiting for Godfather to make a necklace for me with imperial jade!”

“Alright, alright. Let’s go choose now,” Boss Jin said with a smile. He casually patted Jiang Yue’s butt and couldn’t help but rub it twice. “Let’s go!”

“Godfather, you’re so good to me!” Jiang Yue smiled brightly.

Boss Jin instantly swelled up. He smiled until his eyes narrowed into slits. “How obedient!”

Many people at the banquet noticed Jiang Yue. When they saw Jiang Yue’s enchanting appearance, they couldn’t help but want to touch her butt.

Qiao Nian looked at Jiang Yue expressionlessly and sighed helplessly in her heart.

No wonder they had no news of Jiang Yue. It turned out that Jiang Yue had gone to Nancheng and looked for Master Jin.

No matter what, Jiang Yue was still a top student who had graduated from a famous medical school. As long as she was willing to work hard, she could leave a footprint in the medical field. But now, she had degraded herself and become the plaything of a rich businessman.

Although Grandma had already chased Jiang Yue out, she was still thinking about her. There was still a photo of Jiang Yue on her bedside table.

If Grandma knew that Jiang Yue had already become like this, how upset would she be?

At that time, she had painstakingly nurtured Jiang Yue to become a famous scholar, but Jiang Yue had trampled on her painstaking efforts. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Qiao Nian narrowed her eyes slightly, not knowing what to say.

Gu Zhou sensed that something was wrong with Qiao Nian’s expression. He followed Qiao Nian’s gaze and saw that Qiao Nian had been staring at Jiang Yue. He retracted his gaze and looked down at Qiao Nian. He said gently, “Nian’er, let’s go in and take a look first. Let Chen Qing keep an eye on things here. When Mr. Chen comes, Chen Qing will tell us.”

Qiao Nian looked away from Jiang Yue and smiled at Gu Zhou, nodding.

Gu Zhou led Qiao Nian in.

A group of people surrounded them. Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian also walked over and saw the man standing in the middle of the crowd, holding a raw stone.

The onlookers instantly became nervous.

The old man took the raw stone from the man and said respectfully, “Mr. Wang, are you sure you want to cut it now?”

“Go ahead. I want to see what can be obtained from a three-million-yuan raw stone!” Mr. Wang pursed his lips and said solemnly.

In Mr. Wang’s opinion, it was fine as long as this raw stone did not cause him to make a loss.

The old man who cut the raw stone first washed it with water, then used a brush to remove all the dust on the surface of the stone. He used a flashlight to search for the light on the raw stone, which was helpful in determining how to cut it.

After the old man cut the raw stone, he drew a line and handed it to Mr. Wang. “Mr. Wang, I’ll follow this line to open a window!”

“Thank you for your trouble!”

The onlookers were all staring unblinkingly at the screen. The screen showed Mr. Wang’s raw stone.

Everyone held their breaths. Mr. Wang was the first person to open a raw stone today. He had attracted the attention of many people.
