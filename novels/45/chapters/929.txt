Lu Zhu could naturally tell that Qiao Xin wasn’t lying. A trace of surprise flashed in his eyes, not understanding what had happened.

Being stared at by Lu Zhu, Qiao Xin felt a sense of urgency. She hurriedly explained carefully, “Mr. Lu, I’ll explain this to you slowly later. I have a document I want to show you.”

With that, Qiao Xin took out the DNA report Song Man had given her from her bag. This report was a comparison of Song Man’s and Lu Zhu’s DNA, indicating that the two of them were siblings.

Lu Zhu glanced at Qiao Xin with a complicated expression, then took the DNA report.

When Lu Zhu opened the DNA report, his eyes were filled with anger. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

This DNA report was related to him and Song Man. He couldn’t help but grip the report tightly in his hand. Previously, Sugar had told her that Song Man had transplanted her bone marrow, so Song Man’s blood was the same as Sugar’s.

Sugar was the treasure of the Lu family. Everyone in the Lu family doted on her, but those people actually kidnapped her and gave Song Man her bone marrow.

Those people deserved to die.

Qiao Xin stood in front of Lu Zhu. Seeing Lu Zhu’s frown and his grip on the report, she heaved a sigh of relief.

Indeed, everyone in the Lu family cared about the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

Lu Zhu definitely believed this appraisal report and that Song Man was the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

Previously, she had also felt that this matter was a little unreal.

More than twenty years ago, everyone thought that the eldest daughter of the Lu family had already died. Even the kidnappers had personally admitted to tearing her into pieces.

But who would have thought that there would be a turnaround in this matter?

The eldest daughter of the Lu family had actually lived to her twenties.

It was a pity that the eldest daughter of the Lu family was only a few days away from reuniting with her family. If she had been killed by Qiao Nian…

Qiao Xin felt that the Lu family would definitely hate Qiao Nian to death.

Qiao Xin sighed slightly and said sadly, “Some time ago, the eldest daughter of the Lu family came here from Hai Cheng. When I found out her identity, I also wanted to find an opportunity to let her meet you. When the time came, she would be able to acknowledge her ancestors. However, she said that she had other things to do first, so I waited for her at home…”

“Where is she now?” Lu Zhu’s voice was as cold as ice.

At this point, Qiao Xin’s voice choked, and tears instantly welled up in her eyes. “Qiao Nian pushed her from upstairs and she fell to her death! I didn’t expect it to turn out like this either. I just found out that something like this had happened to her. If I had known that this would happen to her, I would have let her go to the Lu family to acknowledge her ancestors first. I wouldn’t have let her leave with regrets… It’s all my fault!”

After Qiao Xin finished speaking, she realized that Lu Zhu had not spoken. A trace of surprise flashed in her heart. She carefully looked up at Lu Zhu.

She really wanted to see Qiao Nian suffer.

Qiao Xin sniffled and continued crying, “Mr. Lu, although what I’m about to say might be making things difficult for you, Song Man only wanted to reunite with her family. In the end, she left this world forever. I hope you can avenge her! Don’t let her die with injustice…”

Lu Zhu frowned, growing impatient. He interrupted Qiao Xin mercilessly. “Who told you Song Man is my sister?”

Qiao Xin was stunned. There were still tears on her face as she looked at Lu Zhu in surprise.

She did not understand why Lu Zhu asked that.

Qiao Xin asked in confusion, “Isn’t there a DNA report? Doesn’t that mean that she’s the eldest daughter of the Lu family? If this doesn’t mean that she’s the eldest daughter of the Lu family, how can you prove that she’s not?”

Lu Zhu looked at Qiao Xin coldly. His gaze was like a sharp blade pressed against Qiao Xin’s neck.

Qiao Xin trembled in fear. She was in a panic. Her gaze fell on the paternity test report and she said, “The paternity test report won’t lie. Song Man is very beautiful and has a good temperament. She saved enough money in Hai Cheng and worked hard to come here just to reunite with her family. In the end, she died because of Qiao Nian’s selfish desires.”

“Mr. Lu, she’s missing an arm. I remember that the Lu family only found a portion of Eldest Miss’s arm back then. All of this means that she’s the eldest daughter of the Lu family. If you don’t believe me, go and investigate!”
