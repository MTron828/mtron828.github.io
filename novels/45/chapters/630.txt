Chapter 631: Guilt

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

When Su Sheng heard Gu Qing’s words, her expression changed slightly. She knew that her senior didn’t believe in her abilities, and her eyes gradually darkened.

Just as Su Sheng was feeling dejected, she heard Gu Qing say, “Su Sheng, do you want to see Mr. Dong Hua with your own eyes?”

Mr. Dong Hua?

He was her idol, the person she admired the most.

Su Sheng looked at Gu Qing in disbelief and asked carefully, “Senior, can I really see him?”

“Yes, he invited me to listen to his new song. At that time, I wanted to bring you along, so I asked him if I could bring another person. He agreed!” Gu Qing looked at Su Sheng dotingly.

The two of them had been very close in school. Coupled with Su Sheng’s lively and adorable personality, she couldn’t help but want to dote on Su Sheng more.

The smile on Su Sheng’s face grew wider and wider. If she had a tail, it would be wagging happily like a dog.

“Senior, I want to go too. You’re so good to me. Thank you!” As Su Sheng spoke, she hugged Gu Qing without hesitation.

“Alright, alright. Sit down quickly. If anyone else sees this, they’ll say that Doctor Su is still like a child!”

“Senior is too good to me! Otherwise, why would I act like a child?”

“You’re not young anymore. You should learn to be more calm. By the way, has anything happened at the studio recently?” Gu Qing stood up and walked towards the desk while looking up at Su Sheng.

Su Sheng walked to the desk and sat down opposite Gu Qing. Then, she took a document from the side and said, “Recently, a few patients with complicated conditions have arrived. I’ve already taken a look at them. I’ve already recorded the details in the document. Senior, you can take a look when the time comes. I don’t know if I’ve made a mistake!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Yes.” Gu Qing took the document and began to read it seriously.

Su Sheng frowned slightly, but it quickly disappeared. She sat there with a smile. “Senior, did you have a good time on this business trip?”

“No. I was busy with work and was a little tired, so I came back early.”

Hearing Gu Qing’s words, Su Sheng smiled and said, “Then Senior must rest early tonight.”

“I’m afraid I won’t be able to rest early tonight.”

“Well?”

“We’re going to listen to Mr. Dong Hua’s new song tonight!” Gu Qing smiled at Su Sheng.

Su Sheng was so shocked that her jaw dropped to the ground. She looked at Gu Qing in disbelief, worried that she hadn’t heard correctly. She repeated, “Senior, are you saying that I’ll be able to see Mr. Dong Hua tonight?”

“Yes.” Gu Qing nodded.

“Oh my god, Senior, I want to take half a day off. I have to go back and prepare!” As Gu Qing spoke, she quickly walked up to Gu Qing and kissed her cheek. She then ran out happily.

Gu Qing looked at Su Sheng’s retreating back and smiled dotingly.

When Su Sheng came out of the studio, her expression turned shy.

Actually, she had seen Mr. Dong Hua before.

Moreover, she knew that Mr. Dong Hua was Lu Zhu.

Everyone in An City knew who Lu Zhu was.

At the thought of this, Su Sheng’s heart began to race. She was looking forward to the meeting tonight.

She had to wear the best-looking clothes and leave a mark in Mr. Dong Hua’s heart. Then, she might be able to be with him.

At the thought of this, Su Sheng smiled shyly.

… .

At the Gu family villa.

Qiao Nian had just finished eating the porridge for Gu Qi. She took a tissue and carefully wiped the stain off Gu Qi’s mouth.

“Little Qi, can you wait for me for a while? I’ll teach you after dinner, okay?” Qiao Nian looked at Gu Qi dotingly and said gently.

Gu Qi’s grape-like eyes flickered as he looked at Qiao Nian and nodded seriously.

Matriarch Gu, who was sitting opposite them, watched as Qiao Nian spoke patiently to Gu Qi. A trace of guilt flashed in her eyes.

Qiao Nian was truly a good child. She treated Gu Qi well from the bottom of her heart. Otherwise, Gu Qi wouldn’t be so clingy to her.

Seeing Qiao Nian like this, Matriarch Gu’s heart ached even more for Qiao Nian. If Qiao Nian knew that Gu Qi was Ah Zhou’s child, she wondered if she would still be so gentle to Gu Qi.

She didn’t know what to do either.

These two children were both good children, but such a cruel thing had happened back then.

Sigh, fate made fools of people.
