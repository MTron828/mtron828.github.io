Song Yu called out gently, “Second Brother?” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I’ve told you before, you can’t call her sister.”

Song Yu’s expression froze, and her face gradually turned pale. “I…”

Lu Nian looked away from Song Yu’s face indifferently and walked out.

Song Yu looked at Lu Nian’s back as he left with an aggrieved expression. She bit the corner of her lips lightly, and her heart felt like it was being clenched tightly by a hand. The pain was unbearable, and even breathing became difficult.

Ever since Song Yu could remember, Second Brother seemed to especially dislike her. He was clearly a cheerful person, but every time he saw her, his expression would be very dark.

In the past, she did not dare to be especially close to Second Brother. Every time, she could only look at him from afar.

It wasn’t until she was nine years old that she accidentally barged into Eldest Miss Lu’s Buddhist hall. At that time, she saw Second Brother standing in front of the windowsill playing the violin.

A quiet smile appeared on Second Brother’s face as he played the warm song.

When the sunlight landed on Second Brother, it was as if he was covered in a layer of golden light, and he had fallen from the sky.

She stood there in a daze, trying her best to remember such a warm Second Brother.

She accidentally kicked a stool beside her.

Second Brother suddenly came to his senses and looked at her angrily.

Although Second Brother had never liked her in the past, he was furious this time.

It was as if she had stepped on Second Brother’s bottom line.

She immediately felt terrified and uneasy. She wanted to explain to Second Brother, but he did not seem to want to bother with her and directly chased her out.

Even now, Song Yu still remembered what her second brother had said.

“You can’t come here casually in the future. You’re just an orphan that my mother casually brought back. You’ll never be my sister.”

It was only then that Song Yu realized that she wasn’t her mother’s biological daughter.

Later on, she heard from the servants that there was a girl who had died young in the Buddhist hall. That girl was Second Brother’s younger sister.

In Second Brother’s heart, the first person should be his dead sister.

As for herself, she was just an abandoned baby brought back from an orphanage. Her second brother had never acknowledged her from the beginning.

Chen Qing drove the car to the entrance of the banquet hall.

Fu Hang led Qiao Nian to the back seat of the car.

Jiang Yue walked to the front passenger seat. Just as she was about to open the door, she heard Gu Zhou’s cold voice. “Drive.”

Gu Zhou’s voice was as cold as ice, without a trace of warmth, let alone tenderness.

Chen Qing did not say anything and drove away.

Jiang Yue was left standing there in a daze.

Her hand was still on the verge of opening the door. After a long moment, she retracted it calmly.

Jiang Yue’s eyes gradually turned red. At the thought of what Qiao Nian had said, fear spread through her heart.

Now, it seemed that Brother Gu Zhou knew everything.

At that moment, a bright red sports car stopped in front of her.

The passenger window slowly rolled down, revealing Song Yu’s bright and exquisite face.

Jiang Yue’s heart couldn’t help but tighten, and she looked embarrassed. She wasn’t sure if Song Yu had seen the scene of her being left behind by Gu Zhou.

Jiang Yue tried her best to perk up and forced a smile. “Sister Song Yu.”

As Old Madam Gu and Old Madam Lu had a good relationship, Song Yu often followed her to the Gu residence to hang out.

Therefore, her relationship with Jiang Yue was not bad. She had hung out with her since she was young.

“You seem distracted. Did something happen?”

Hearing Song Yu’s words, Jiang Yue heaved a sigh of relief. It seemed that Song Yu hadn’t seen the scene of her being abandoned by Brother Gu Zhou.

Jiang Yue smiled and shook her head. “I’m fine.”

“Where’s Brother Ah Zhou?”
