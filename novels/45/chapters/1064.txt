1065 Thank You

Gu Zhou let go of Qiao Nian’s hand and took a few steps back. He looked at Qiao Nian, who was smiling back at him, and recalled what Qiao Nian had said in the private room. His heart rippled.

Qiao Nian smiled brightly. Behind her was the beautiful and dreamy An City. He wanted to capture the entire scenery, but his attention couldn’t help but fall on Qiao Nian’s face.

His slender hands enlarged the image on the phone. Qiao Nian occupied two-thirds of the cell phone, making it look like a beautiful portrait.

He looked down at Qiao Nian on the phone. His phone didn’t capture Qiao Nian’s beauty at all.

!!

Qiao Nian saw Gu Zhou looking down at his cell phone. Puzzled, she walked over and followed Gu Zhou’s gaze. She saw that he was staring at her photo.

Smiling, she took Gu Zhou’s phone. She had wanted to zoom out to take a look at the entire river scenery, but the photo couldn’t be zoomed out. Only then did she realize that Gu Zhou had specially taken this photo of her.

“You took a good photo,” Qiao Nian said with a smile, staring unblinkingly at the photo.

Previously, she had heard from others that boyfriends and husbands did not know how to take photos, but Gu Zhou was different. He seemed to be omnipotent.

“Thank you for just now.”

Gu Zhou’s low and gentle voice entered her ears. Qiao Nian’s hand, which was holding the phone, paused for a moment, and the smile in her eyes froze. Then, she looked up at Gu Zhou, who was beside her, and their eyes inadvertently met.

It was as if she was the only one left in his eyes.

The tips of Qiao Nian’s ears turned slightly red. She raised her eyebrows slightly and said, “Why are you being so polite? You even said before that there’s no need for us to thank each other.”

After a pause, Qiao Nian continued, “But you can express it with actions!”

Smiling, Qiao Nian stood on her tiptoes and planted a light kiss on Gu Zhou’s lips. She quickly left, her eyes filled with laughter.

The light kiss was like an electric current, numbing.

Gu Zhou stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian’s beautiful face. His breathing quickened involuntarily, and his eyes burned. He yearned to strip Qiao Nian naked.

In the past, Qiao Nian would look away shyly every time. But this time, Qiao Nian didn’t look away. Instead, she looked at him openly.

In the past, she knew that Gu Zhou liked her, but she wasn’t sure how much.

But after what had just happened, she realized how important she was to him.

No one could replace her. She was the most precious and unique to him.

Gu Zhou’s phoenix-like eyes grew deeper and deeper. His eyes were very bright, as if he had seen the most precious thing in the world. He swallowed and said, “Nian’er, you still want it.”

Before Gu Zhou spoke, Qiao Nian seemed to be able to guess what he was going to say. Perhaps it was because the two of them had been together for a long time, but she could guess what he was thinking.

Qiao Nian’s eyes curved up slightly. She tried hard to pretend to be calm and asked evilly, “You have to pay attention to your image in public. Otherwise, you’ll be in the headlines tomorrow!”

“Let’s go home!”

Qiao Nian teased, “Didn’t you come to the river to relax? How are you going to relax if you go home?”

“With you around, I’m very satisfied.” Gu Zhou held Qiao Nian’s hand tightly, his fingers intertwined, as if he wanted to fuse with her body. His gaze gradually turned sharp, carrying a strong sense of aggression.

Qiao Nian’s kiss just now had long taken away the displeasure in his heart.

Qiao Nian was speechless.

This man was too fickle!

Or was this man too easy to coax?

Before Qiao Nian could speak, Gu Zhou picked her up horizontally. She subconsciously wrapped her arms around his neck, worried that she would fall.

Gu Zhou looked down at Qiao Nian, who was in his arms. His face was reflected in her eyes, as if he was the only one in her world.

“I can walk by myself,” Qiao Nian said in a low voice, staring unblinkingly at Gu Zhou.

A cold wind blew, and Qiao Nian’s skirt fluttered in the wind. Her hair was a little messy and she looked like a cold beauty.

“I can walk fast!”

Before Qiao Nian could react, Gu Zhou placed her in the front passenger seat. She was about to fasten her seatbelt when Gu Zhou already helped her do so considerately.
