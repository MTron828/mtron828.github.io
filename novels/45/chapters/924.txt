925 Turn yourself in!

Moreover, Qiao Nian was about to die. Why should she stoop to the level of a dead person?

Qiao Nian looked at Qiao Xin meaningfully and asked, “Are you thinking of working with Song Man and taking me down directly? If I’m not wrong, Song Man should have taken the initiative to find you and tell you that she’s the eldest daughter of the Lu family. Am I right?”

When Qiao Xin heard Qiao Nian’s words, her frown deepened. Qiao Nian was really smart. With just a few words, she could discover what was going on between her and Song Man.

It was useless to have a good brain if you have a bad life.

At the thought of this, Qiao Xin couldn’t help but laugh. She said, “If you have time to guess, why don’t you think about what to do in the future?”

Qiao Nian looked at Qiao Xin sympathetically. She had thought that Qiao Xin would know more, but now it seemed that Qiao Xin didn’t know much.

Poor Qiao Xin. She still didn’t know that she was just a small chess piece for Song Man.

Seeing Qiao Nian’s strange expression, Qiao Xin coughed and said, “You’re a murderer now, and you’ve already confessed. I’ll call the police now and get them to arrest you!”

At this point, Qiao Xin paused for a moment and continued, “On account that we’re sisters, I won’t make this call. Why don’t you just turn yourself in?”

Qiao Nian walked towards Qiao Xin in her high heels.

Qiao Xin was so frightened that she hurriedly took a few steps back. She pressed her body against the wall and looked at Qiao Nian warily. She stammered, “I… I’m telling you, don’t even think about killing me to silence me! I came here today. I’ve already told my mother that if anything happens to me, they’ll quickly find out that it’s you!”

Qiao Nian smiled, a trace of disdain flashing across her face. She asked, “Aren’t you thinking too much about me killing you? How can someone like you be worthy? I’ll dirty my hands if I kill you!”

When Qiao Xin heard that Qiao Nian wouldn’t kill her, she heaved a sigh of relief. However, what was the meaning of Qiao Nian’s disdainful gaze?

Qiao Xin pretended to be calm and said, “Then you should turn yourself in as soon as possible!”

Back then, when Song Man looked for Qiao Xin, Qiao Xin didn’t believe that Song Man was the eldest daughter of the Lu family. Therefore, at that time, she specially investigated the kidnapping of the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

At that time, the Lu family had only found one arm of the eldest daughter of the Lu family. Moreover, Song Man had taken out the paternity test certificate between her and someone from the Lu family.

Therefore, Song Man must be the eldest daughter of the Gu family.

Qiao Nian might have to spend the rest of her life in a tomb.

When Qiao Nian heard Qiao Xin’s words, she smiled and said disdainfully, “Confidence is a good thing. Someone like you isn’t confident, but blindly arrogant. I hope you’ll have the last laugh!”

With that, Qiao Nian turned around and walked out.

After Qiao Nian left, the pressure she felt disappeared. Qiao Xin heaved a sigh of relief.

She felt that Qiao Nian really didn’t know her limits. She actually dared to go against the Lu family.

However, she felt that Qiao Nian was the fool. She had even given Qiao Nian many gifts outside. Tonight would definitely be a breeze for Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian walked out of the private room, her expression darkening.

She had thought that Qiao Xin might know who was behind Song Man. Now, it seemed that she was overthinking.

Qiao Xin was as stupid as ever. She didn’t realize that something was wrong with Song Man at all.

With a heavy heart, Qiao Nian walked out. Just as she was about to reach the door, five people blocked her path.

“Oh, beauty, what’s your name? Let’s exchange contact information so that it’ll be easier to communicate in the future!” As the man spoke, his gaze gradually moved down from Qiao Nian’s face, not hiding the desire in his eyes at all.

Qiao Nian’s eyes instantly darkened.

The man looked at Qiao Nian’s curvaceous figure lustfully. Swallowing, he reached out to hug Qiao Nian’s waist. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

A cold glint flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes. Without hesitation, she shook off the man’s hand.

“Oh, you’re a hot-tempered beauty! I like this kind of beauty. It’s exciting!” The man wasn’t angry at all. He even wanted to hug Qiao Nian’s waist again.
