Chapter 1652 Crisis

"Madam was just overly emotional just now. Now, she's stabilized." Qiao Nian recalled what Shen Mei had said previously and said, "She said that after she was kidnapped, she seemed to have heard someone say the name Cui Huai. However, I'm not sure what exactly happened. I don't know what relationship Cui Huai has with Cui Qi. We can only ask Cui Qi when he wakes up."

"Let's go eat!" Gu Zhou drove Qiao Nian to a Western restaurant. He parked the car at the door. After getting out of the car, he naturally opened the passenger door without waiting for Qiao Nian to open it. He smiled at Qiao Nian and made a gentlemanly gesture. "Please."

Qiao Nian smiled at Gu Zhou and placed her hand on his before getting out of the car.

Gu Zhou closed the door of the front passenger seat and handed the key to the attendant. Only then did he walk in with his arm around Qiao Nian's waist.

Qiao Nian smiled at Gu Zhou and said softly, "What's wrong? Do you feel a sense of danger?"

"Yes." Gu Zhou nodded in agreement.

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She tugged at his shirt and said with a smile, "Don't tell me it's because of Cui Qi. Oh my, don't tease me. I'm a little afraid of his face. You're so good-looking. I'll definitely look at you every day."

Gu Zhou lowered his gaze and looked at Qiao Nian, his eyes sparkling. He lowered his head and moved closer to her ear, his hot breath hitting Qiao Nian's ear. "Mrs. Gu, it seems that you just like my face."

Qiao Nian's ears itched. She looked at Gu Zhou with a smile and said gently, "Yes, Mr. Gu has actually discovered my intentions. Mr. Gu is the most beautiful person I've ever seen in An City. Even in Europe, I've never seen anyone better-looking than Mr. Gu. Mr. Gu, you're simply my type. You're even more perfect than the most perfect person I've imagined."

As Qiao Nian spoke, her ears turned slightly red. She stood on her tiptoes playfully and asked softly, "Mr. Gu, what are you trying to get from me?"

Gu Zhou looked down into Qiao Nian's eyes and slowly retracted his gaze. He walked towards the dining table. After ordering the dishes and the waiter left, he stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian and asked softly, "Do you know that it's very dangerous for you to do that in court today?"

The smile on Qiao Nian's face gradually disappeared. She could tell that Gu Zhou was worried.

"Do you know how worried I was about you?" Gu Zhou continued to ask.

Qiao Nian could sense that the ambiguous atmosphere between the two of them had already disappeared. She recalled what had happened in court. Actually, she had only wanted to convict Mark on the spot, which was why she had said what she wanted to say without hesitation.

But Gu Zhou was right. She had forgotten about him, and that he would worry about her.

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze slightly and said guiltily, "I… I was just thinking…"

Qiao Nian thought of the scene in the court. In the end, she said helplessly, "I just wanted to end that matter as soon as possible. I shouldn't have done anything rash."

Seeing Qiao Nian blaming herself, Gu Zhou's heart instantly softened. He reached out and caressed Qiao Nian's face, saying softly, "Don't be sad. The past is in the past. In court, I experienced the president's helplessness and understood why he did that."

Qiao Nian stared unblinkingly at Gu Zhou. When she heard Gu Zhou mention the president, she recalled what had made Shen Mei sad. She sighed softly and said helplessly, "Has Lina already confirmed that she's marrying to Wright?"

In her opinion, such a sunny and innocent girl like Lina deserved a better man. Wright was not worthy at all.

"Yes." Gu Zhou nodded and said softly, "The president has already discussed the wedding date with his people, right?"

Qiao Nian's pupils dilated uncontrollably. She said in disbelief, "This…"

Gu Zhou reached out and ruffled Qiao Nian's hair. His eyes were filled with a faint smile as he said in a low voice, "Mark was upset about what happened in court. After the court session ended, he forced the president to marry Lina to Wright. As for the president…"

Qiao Nian gasped. She seemed to have thought of something and sighed helplessly.
