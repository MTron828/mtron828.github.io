Chapter 616: Help

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Previously, Doctor Gu Qing said that Little Qi’s autism is very likely due to a lack of care and concern. Doctor Su, who came today, said that Little Qi’s autism is congenital. I think Doctor Gu Qing is right, but I want to wait for Doctor Gu Qing to come here to take a look at Little Qi first.” Qiao Nian secretly hoped that Gu Qi didn’t have autism, and she felt that Gu Qing might be more accurate.

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, his expression remained unchanged.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion. Frowning slightly, she asked curiously, “Gu Zhou, aren’t you worried about him at all?”

Gu Zhou’s eyes flickered. He lowered his voice and said softly, “When he was two years old, the doctor had already determined that he was naturally autistic.”

She looked slightly stunned, and her heart ached.

That made sense. Gu Zhou was very concerned about Gu Qi. He had probably discovered Gu Qi’s problem long ago.

With the Gu family’s capabilities, they might be able to find a better psychiatrist to treat Gu Qi.

However, she had never expected such an obedient child like Gu Qi to have autism.

She looked up slightly. Just as she was about to say something, she noticed that Gu Zhou was staring at her.

“What’s wrong?” Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion.

His eyes narrowed slightly as he asked uncertainly, “Your lips…”

Subconsciously, Gu Zhou recalled seeing him and Qiao Nian…

“I accidentally bit it. Don’t mind me.” Qiao Nian hurriedly changed the topic. Seeing that Gu Zhou had finally looked away, she heaved a sigh of relief.

“Did you leave the house this morning because of this?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Gu Zhou’s tone was very calm, and his voice was very gentle. He was asking her a question, not questioning her.

Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou. At this moment, Gu Zhou’s expression had completely changed. He didn’t look angry at all. There was even a hint of joy in his words.

“Yes.” At this point, Qiao Nian’s frown deepened. Her voice was a little low as she said, “I originally wanted to ask Doctor Gu Qing to come over and take a look at Little Qi, but she had something on and had to leave for a long trip today. I think I’ll ask Doctor Gu Qing to take a look at her in the future.”

When Qiao Nian said this, her chest felt heavy. Her only hope was that Little Qi was fine.

Suddenly, she recalled the first time she had seen Gu Qi. They had been near the funeral home.

At that time, she had never expected that beautiful and adorable young lady to have autism.

Something was wrong.

She seemed to have realized something.

Qiao Nian’s eyes lit up.

During her time with Gu Qi, she had not discovered anything wrong with him.

She found out from the people around Gu Qi that he was sick.

For example, Gu Qi’s teacher, Chen Qing, and Gu Zhou.

In their eyes, Gu Qi was not a normal child.

However, that night, she felt that Gu Qi was a smart child. Moreover, he was especially polite and wary of strangers.

How could such a smart child be born with autism?

Qiao Nian’s fox-like eyes lit up. She looked up at Gu Zhou and asked, “Do you think Little Qi isn’t autistic?”

Gu Zhou’s heavy expression already represented his thoughts.

Qiao Nian hurriedly said, “When I first met him, my impression of him was that he was intelligent and had a strong sense of security. At that time, he called me Auntie and asked me for help.”

Gu Zhou was slightly stunned, and his eyes darkened. He suspected that the Little Qi Qiao Nian was talking about was really Gu Qi.

“You helped him?”

Qiao Nian thought of Gu Qi at that time and couldn’t help but laugh. Her eyes were filled with gentleness as she explained patiently, “That night, when I went to the funeral parlor, I saw him walking around. I thought he was lost. At that time, he was still dressed like a young lady.”

Gu Zhou’s heart ached. In the past, Gu Qi had said that he only wore girls’ clothes because he thought Gu Zhou liked girls.

Qiao Nian didn’t notice Gu Zhou’s emotions. She continued, “I wanted to send him home, but he was very security-conscious and didn’t want me to send him home. He borrowed money from me for a meal, then the two of us added each other on WeChat. He even returned the money to me.”
