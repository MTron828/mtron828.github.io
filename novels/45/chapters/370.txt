Chapter 371: Trust Her

Jiang Qi walked down from the stage and stood at the side of the long table. Looking at Qiao Nian’s familiar face, his heart jumped to his throat.

The stone wall was composed of Chinese paintings.

Chinese painting emphasizes the free hand, so the image is initially shaped by lines. The goal was to create a look alike, and the artistic concept was important.

Old Master Jiang Qi watched as the brush in Qiao Nian’s hand obediently outlined the stone wall. Then, the structure of the stone wall was revealed.

Could Qiao Nian really be Mr. Huang Shi?

With this trace of doubt, Jiang Qi continued watching.

Holding the brush in her hand, Qiao Nian drew freely. Strangely, the brush in her hand was exceptionally obedient. The ink stains were exactly the same size as the stone wall painting.

From this, it could be seen that Qiao Nian had great control over her brush and ink.

Qiao Xin, who was standing at the side, watched as Qiao Nian drew. Her heart clenched involuntarily.

In her impression, her brother loved Chinese painting very much. Moreover, her brother usually painted like this.

Qiao Xin recalled what Qiao Yu had just said. He was telling the truth about Qiao Nian. In that case, it was very likely that Qiao Nian was Mr. Huang Shi…

...

At the thought of this, Qiao Xin felt terrible. A bitter taste spread in her heart.

Qiao Nian was clearly a wild girl from the countryside. Why was she so amazing?

Not only did Qiao Nian know how to cultivate medicinal herbs, but she also knew how to play the violin. Now, she had become the world-renowned artist, Mr. Huang Shi.

How could a person be so outstanding?

Qiao Xin gradually felt inferior. When she thought about how she was inferior to Qiao Nian in every way, she felt so sad that she was about to suffocate.

Everyone’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian. Only Gu Zhou realized that Qiao Yu’s eyes were filled with undisguised possessiveness towards Qiao Nian. The smile on Qiao Yu’s face was as if he was looking at his woman.

Gu Zhou’s eyes darkened. He thought carefully about what had happened today, and the change in Qiao Nian’s attitude.

In the beginning, Qiao Nian didn’t seem to have any intention of exposing her identity.

However, in the midst of everyone’s doubts, Qiao Nian’s greatest hope was that Madam Li and Old Master Jiang Qi would be able to determine the authenticity of the painting. However, neither of them had made the right judgment.

Amidst everyone’s condemnation, Qiao Yu stepped forward to speak up for Qiao Nian. He looked so certain, as if he had long known which painting was real.

Now that he thought about it, Qiao Yu’s attitude back then seemed to be saying that he knew who Mr. Huang Shi was, or that he had participated in Mr. Huang Shi’s creation.

Even at this moment, Qiao Nian still didn’t admit her identity.

Previously, he had wanted to take Qiao Nian away. Suddenly, Qiao Nian seemed to have made a decision. She decided to tell them that she was Mr. Huang Shi.

This decision seemed to be very important to Qiao Nian.

Gu Zhou didn’t quite understand what had happened to Qiao Nian. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

According to the rumors, Mr. Huang Shi had sealed his brush many years ago.

But now, Qiao Nian picked up her brush again.

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on Qiao Yu’s face again. He had a vague feeling that Qiao Yu knew the reason why Qiao Nian stopped.

At the thought of this, Gu Zhou felt a little uncomfortable. His eyes instantly turned cold.

Qiao Yu seemed to sense Gu Zhou’s gaze and looked up at him.

At this moment, when the two men’s eyes met, lightning and fire sparked.

Chen Qing, who was standing at the side, shivered in fear.

With his simple thinking, even a single mother could tell that Qiao Yu was looking at Qiao Nian possessively. Moreover, it was clearly the gaze of a man looking at a woman.

Qiao Nian was so focused on the painting that she didn’t notice the storm brewing between Gu Zhou and Qiao Yu.
