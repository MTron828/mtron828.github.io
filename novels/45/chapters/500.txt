Lu Zhu frowned slightly. He looked at Qiao Nian solemnly and nodded thoughtfully.

The eldest daughter of the Lu family was a taboo topic in the Lu family. Basically, no one would mention her because this was the deepest pain in everyone’s heart.

As soon as everyone mentioned her, they would remember the tragic state she was in when she died. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Every time Lu Zhu dreamed of his sister, his heart would feel heavy.

In his dream, his sister was crying her heart out. Her voice was choked as she asked him, “Brother, why didn’t you come and save me earlier? When they cut me up, it hurt…”

Every time he dreamed of this, he would feel pain and guilt for a long time.

“I’m the sister who’s been dead to you for more than twenty years!”

When Lu Zhu heard Qiao Nian’s words, he was shocked. His heart raced, and his voice trembled. “Do you know what you’re saying?”

Qiao Nian’s gaze landed on Doctor Sha, who was not far away. She shouted, “Doctor Sha, please come over!”

Doctor Sha walked over. He took out the paternity test report from his white coat and handed it to Lu Zhu. “Mr. Lu, this can clear all your doubts!”

Lu Zhu glanced at Doctor Sha and hesitated for a moment before reaching out to take the paternity test report. His fingers were trembling.

Lu Zhu carefully opened the paternity test report. When he reached the end, his eyes widened involuntarily.

“Brother-sister relationship…” Lu Zhu exclaimed. This was the first time he had lost his composure.

Qiao Nian understood that this outcome might not be easy to digest. After reading the results, she took a long time to accept this fact.

Lu Zhu glanced at the date of the appraisal at the bottom. His mouth was agape. After a long while, he looked at Qiao Nian.

When he took a closer look at Qiao Nian, he vaguely saw Lu Qi’s shadow on her, as well as his mother’s appearance.

At this moment, Lu Zhu finally understood why he felt an inexplicable sense of familiarity when he took the bullet for her.

Her aura was bright and beautiful, completely different from Lu Qi’s innocence. But even so, the way he looked at her was exactly the same as his feelings for Lu Qi.

So this was family.

It was only then that Lu Zhu realized that Qiao Nian was exactly the same as his mother when she was young. They were both beautiful.

Lu Zhu’s throat was slightly choked.

His sister, who had been dead for more than twenty years, was actually still alive.

It had to be known that he had seen the pieces of his sister’s body with his own eyes back then. He felt extremely guilty, and this had become his nightmare for the past twenty years.

Lu Zhu’s breathing quickened involuntarily. He staggered back a step.

Qiao Nian was very worried about Lu Zhu’s health. She quickly walked forward and reached out to support Lu Zhu. She asked worriedly, “Brother, are you alright?”

Lu Zhu’s breathing quickened. He grabbed Qiao Nian’s hand and clenched his fists. When he felt the warmth of Qiao Nian’s hand, he woke up from his nightmare.

Her palm was warm, and he could still feel her breathing. All of this made Lu Zhu realize that he was not dreaming.

Qiao Nian looked at Lu Zhu worriedly and hurriedly used her other hand to gently pat his back. She said softly, “Brother, you can’t be too agitated now. Breathe slowly…”

“Sugar …”

Lu Zhu’s voice was hoarse.

Qiao Nian stood beside Lu Zhu and could hear her clearly. She thought that Lu Zhu had low blood sugar. She looked up at Doctor Sha and asked, “Doctor Sha, is there any sugar?”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s question, Doctor Sha shook his head and looked at Lu Zhu worriedly.

“Brother, don’t scare me…”

“Sugar.”

Lu Zhu cried out softly. Then, he pulled Qiao Nian into his arms and hugged her tightly.
