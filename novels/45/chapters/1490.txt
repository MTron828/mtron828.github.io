Qiao Nian thought for a while and said, “It’s probably because the environment suddenly changed. Madam couldn’t accept it for a moment and was depressed, so she fell ill.”

At this moment, a soft snort came from inside the bed curtains.

Qiao Nian subconsciously looked at the bed, but because of the bed curtains, she could vaguely see Madam President struggling on the bed and not sleeping well.

The President looked at Madam worriedly. Seeing that her eyelashes were trembling, as if she was about to wake up, he frowned.

In the past, Madam had often had relapses, and she couldn’t control them. He could only get the doctor to give her a tranquilizer.

However, there were side effects of injecting too much sedatives, and this time, he asked the doctor to inject some. It seemed that she was about to wake up.

In her sleep, her brow was still furrowed. Her body struggled desperately, as if she had been tied up in her sleep.

The president looked at his Madam with heartache. He lowered his head and whispered into her ear, comforting her, “Be good, it’s fine. You’re very safe now. Don’t worry.”

Even though the president was comforting her, she seemed to be completely immersed in her own world and couldn’t hear anything else. She continued to struggle desperately.

The president looked at Madam sadly, his eyes turning red.

Although Qiao Nian couldn’t see the situation inside clearly, she could sense Madam President’s discomfort. She said softly, “The most important thing now is to let Madam rest well. When she wakes up and sees Lina, she should be fine.”

Even if Madam President woke up now, she wouldn’t be able to recognize Lina at all. Her condition couldn’t be good.

When the president heard Qiao Nian’s words, his heart seemed to be gripped tightly by a hand. It hurt so much that he wanted to die.

He would rather be the one suffering every day than see her in so much pain.

He was in so much pain that it was difficult to breathe. Slowly, he closed his eyes. After a long while, he said, “Ollie, prepare the tranquilizer! Increase the dosage.”

When Professor Ollie heard the president’s words, he nodded and turned to walk towards the next room. His team and resources were all in the next room.

When Professor Ollie came in again, he was holding a syringe. He handed it to the president.

The bed curtains only lifted a crack. The President took the syringe and personally injected a sedative into Madam President.

The struggling Madam President gradually calmed down. The ferociousness on her face disappeared, leaving only calmness.

Seeing that Madam President had really fallen asleep, the President covered her with the blanket, lifted the bed curtains, and walked out.

Qiao Nian had been sitting by the bed. The moment the President lifted the bed curtains, she stole a glance inside. However, the President was too fast. Before she could take a good look at Madam President, the President had already lowered the bed curtains.

“Yes,” Qiao Nian replied. Instinctively, she looked at the president. When she saw that the president’s forehead was dripping with blood and his hands were covered in blood, she frowned. “Mr. President, you’re injured. You need to get a tetanus shot immediately.”

Initially, Qiao Nian only felt that Madam President’s pulse was strange. As she hadn’t seen Madam President in person, she wasn’t completely confident. However, she still said honestly, “I just took Madam President’s pulse and discovered something strange.”

“Tell me.” The president walked out.

Qiao Nian followed. She knew in her heart that she wouldn’t be able to see Madam President today, but she still told the president what she had discovered.

“I just took Madam’s pulse and discovered something strange. However, if I want to get to the bottom of it, I would need a face to face consultation.”

At this point, Qiao Nian turned back to look at the bed and said, “It’s just that Madam doesn’t want me to see her now, so I can’t say what’s wrong with her accurately. If I want to examine her health, I still have to see her in person. Only then can I confirm the treatment plan.”
