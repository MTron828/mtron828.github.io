Where exactly did the fragrance of the lilies come from?

Qiao Nian walked up to Jiang Yue and looked down at her. She said calmly, “Most people only spray a little perfume. They won’t spray so much.”

Jiang Yue frowned slightly, tears still glistening on her face.

“The fragrance on you is jasmine, and the most obvious scent in the air now is the fragrance of lilies.” Qiao Nian paused and glanced at the women present. She continued, “Matriarch Lu uses the perfume of peony flowers. Lu Qi should be using the perfume of gardenias. Song Yu’s perfume is the fragrance of plum blossoms. The perfume I’m using is daffodils.”

Jiang Yue’s frown deepened. She didn’t understand what Qiao Nian meant by this.

Qiao Nian smiled at Jiang Yue and asked, “Who do you think used the lily perfume?”

At Qiao Nian’s words, the blood drained from Jiang Yue’s face. She lowered her gaze in fear, clenching the perfume in her hand tightly.

Jiang Yue sensed Qiao Nian walking up to her and took a step back.

“What are you trying to do?” Jiang Yue looked at Qiao Nian warily, the uneasiness in her heart gradually growing.

“If someone really cares about her deceased mother’s belongings, why would they be willing to casually pour out her mother’s perfume?” Qiao Nian asked coldly.

Jiang Yue’s heart skipped a beat. She gradually tightened her grip on the perfume bottle.

Qiao Nian was like a dangerous monster, approaching her and biting her.

Qiao Nian’s every word was like the teeth of a monster, biting viciously into her body.

Jiang Yue was in so much pain that it was difficult to breathe. She lowered her head and pursed her lips. How could she not know what Qiao Nian meant? F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Qiao Nian was implying that the sulfuric acid was in her perfume bottle.

Jiang Yue tried her best to remain calm. As long as she didn’t panic, Qiao Nian wouldn’t be able to do anything to her.

“How can you say that? You’re insulting my mother!” Jiang Yue looked at Qiao Nian with teary eyes, speaking pitifully.

Gu Zhou glanced at Qiao Nian, his gaze once again falling on the perfume in Jiang Yue’s hand.

A trace of impatience flashed between Gu Zhou’s eyebrows. He loosened his tie and said coldly, “Give the perfume to Qiao Nian. Let her take a look and she’ll know if it’s perfume or sulfuric acid!”

“But this was left behind by my mother!” Jiang Yue looked at Gu Zhou in despair. She had never expected Brother Ah Zhou to still be on Qiao Nian’s side.

What was so good about Qiao Nian?

Why did everyone have to help Qiao Nian?

In order to verify if there was sulfuric acid in the perfume, Brother Ah Zhou actually asked her to open the things her mother had left behind.

Qiao Nian took out a silver needle from her pocket and said calmly, “Will you take the initiative to give me the perfume bottle, or should I cripple your hand first and take the perfume back?”

When Jiang Yue heard Qiao Nian’s words, she hugged the perfume bottle and hid it behind her. Tears streamed down her face like a tide.

Her face grew paler and paler. She said in pain, “I think you’re no longer human. Why do you suspect me and still want to touch my mother’s belongings!”

“Are you just looking for where the sulfuric acid came from? Why do you all suspect me? For your own selfish reasons, you want to touch my mother’s belongings. Qiao Nian, what’s wrong with your conscience?” Jiang Yue said hysterically. She squatted on the ground, holding the perfume bottle tightly in her hand.

Seeing Jiang Yue like this, a trace of heartache flashed in Matriarch Lu’s eyes. She looked at Qiao Nian again and saw that she looked very confident. For a moment, she didn’t know who to side with.

Qiao Nian stood there expressionlessly, clenching the silver needle in her hand. “I’ll count to three. One, two…”

Before Qiao Nian could say “three”, she saw Jiang Yue throw the perfume bottle into the bushes at the side.

Initially, Qiao Nian wasn’t completely confident, but seeing Jiang Yue like this, she instantly understood.

Jiang Yue really poured out all her mother’s perfume, then put the sulfuric acid into the perfume bottle.

Qiao Nian looked at Jiang Yue coldly. Ever since she married into the Gu family, she had never thought of targeting anyone.
