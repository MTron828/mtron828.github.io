1508 Concern would lead to confusion

In order to cultivate this Falling Autumn Grass, she had been staying in the medicinal room, worried about others interfering with her work.

There was definitely nothing wrong with the Falling Autumn Grass she had cultivated. Then, the problem was very likely to be the Falling Autumn Grass Annie had brought.

Realizing this, Qiao Nian narrowed her eyes.

Lina saw that the president and Qiao Nian didn’t look well. Although she was also very sad that her mother hadn’t recovered, she knew that none of this was Qiao Nian’s fault.

The tears in Lina’s eyes fell uncontrollably. She sniffled and raised her hand to wipe her tears. She turned to look at the President. “Dad, Nian Nian said that there’s nothing wrong with her Falling Autumn Grass, so there’s nothing wrong with it. Moreover, she didn’t have to treat Mom’s illness, but she still agreed. No matter what the outcome is, we should accept the current results calmly and believe in Nian Nian’s medical skills.”

When the president heard Lina’s words, he recalled how pale and weak Lina had been lying on the hospital bed. At that time, it had taken Qiao Nian ten hours to pull Lina back from the gates of hell.

Concern would lead to confusion.

He was too concerned about Madam, so he suspected Qiao Nian.

The president sighed slightly. Qiao Nian was a doctor who was here to save Madam. Even if she couldn’t be saved, he shouldn’t vent his anger on Qiao Nian.

The President let go of the flower pot slightly and sighed helplessly. He looked at Qiao Nian gently and was about to speak when a servant ran over.

“Mr. President, Princess Annie is outside the palace. She’s making a scene and wants to come in.”

Annie?

The President recalled how Annie had threatened him that day. His expression darkened and he frowned. “I’m not seeing her. Chase her away!”

When the servant heard the president’s words, she stole a glance at him and said softly, “But Princess Annie has already barged in, ignoring the guards’ obstruction.”

The president was already unhappy. This was the palace, not a garden. Annie simply didn’t take him seriously. She thought she could enter the palace casually.

The president’s expression instantly darkened. He stuffed the Falling Autumn Grass into Lina’s hand and clenched his fists tightly. He walked out, preparing to chase Annie out himself.

Qiao Nian’s lips curved up slightly. Smiling, she said, “Mr. President, aren’t you thinking about what’s wrong? I think there’ll be a result soon.”

The president stopped in his tracks and looked at Qiao Nian in confusion. He couldn’t believe that Qiao Nian wanted to see Annie. “Are you saying… that Annie was the one who tampered with it?”

“I think she’ll definitely give us a satisfactory answer.” Qiao Nian’s beautiful fox-like eyes narrowed slightly, and her lips curved up slightly.

Seeing Qiao Nian’s affirmative gaze, the president seemed to have thought of something. He nodded and said to the servant, “Bring her over!”

Annie had just barged through the door. She ignored the guns aimed at her. She was very sure that the president would definitely get someone to look for her. After all, only the Falling Autumn Grass she had brought could calm Madam President down.

The servant quickly ran out and walked respectfully to Annie. “Princess Annie, the president invites you in.”

Annie looked up arrogantly, lifting her long red hair. Her entire body sparkled under the sunlight. In her high heels, she walked in smugly.

When Annie saw the president, she was about to speak when her gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face.

Gu Zhou was already eye-catching just by standing there.

She looked at Gu Zhou with a burning gaze. She had long investigated Gu Zhou’s background.

In Country Z, the Gu family was a top-notch family, and the Gu family’s assets in Europe were already comparable to those of the royal family.

Gu Zhou was the only heir of the Gu family. As long as she married Gu Zhou, she would be able to do whatever she wanted in Country Z and Europe.

Moreover, she had also found out that Gu Zhou was unmarried.

Annie’s lips curved up slightly. Only such a good man was worthy of her in this world. She dismissed all the ordinary men around her.

There was no substitute for an absolutely perfect man. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

However, Annie had also found out that Qiao Nian was Gu Zhou’s private doctor. At the thought that the two of them were so close, her expression turned ugly.
