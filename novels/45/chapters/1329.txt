1330 Scandal

Xiao Bao frowned and sighed like an adult. “If only Dad wasn’t so busy with work. Daddy used to be so busy too. He couldn’t accompany me often.”

“Children have to study. Adults have to work and earn money. This is what we have to do,” Qiao Nian said patiently to Xiao Bao. She patted his head. “You’ll understand when you grow up.”

“Mommy, I’ll spend all the money I earn from work on you in the future!” Xiao Bao said very filially.

“Yes, Mommy will save it up for you when the time comes.” Qiao Nian smiled at Xiao Bao and lowered her head to kiss his forehead. Holding Xiao Bao in her arms, she looked out of the window with a complicated expression.

She wondered when their family would be reunited.

The plane took off. Xiao Bao watched as everything around him gradually shrank. His heart gradually emptied. He knew that he might not come here again.

Daddy, Uncle Feng, when can you go home?

…

When they arrived at An City, Qiao Nian walked out of the plane with Xiao Bao, who was already sound asleep. She turned on her cell phone and saw that Lu Zhu had called more than ten times.

Qiao Nian hurriedly replied. The call went through in the next second.

“Brother!”

“Sugar, look ahead!”

Sugar.

It had been a long time since she had heard this form of address. Her uneasy heart instantly calmed down. She looked up and saw Lu Zhu standing not far ahead.

Lu Zhu was wearing a black suit and a wine-red tie. There was a faint smile on his lips, and the way he looked at Qiao Nian was very gentle, like the spring sun.

Qiao Nian waved at Lu Zhu and hung up with a smile.

She hugged the child in her arms tightly and jogged to Lu Zhu in her high heels. She called out sweetly, “Brother!”

When Lu Zhu saw the child in Qiao Nian’s arms, his heart seemed to be clenched tightly by an invisible hand.

Back then, Sugar was still a child when she was kidnapped. Now, Sugar already had a child of this age.

She was clearly so thin and young, but she had to support her three children.

He had always hoped that Sugar could live a carefree life like a little girl.

Qiao Nian waved her hand in front of Lu Zhu and called out again, “Brother?”

Lu Zhu came back to his senses and looked at Qiao Nian with heartache. He smiled and reached out to take the child from Qiao Nian’s arms. “Let me carry him!”

However, in his sleep, Xiao Bao kept his arm around Qiao Nian’s neck, unwilling to let go. His little face found a comfortable position on Qiao Nian’s shoulder and he fell into a deep sleep.

Seeing that Xiao Bao was unwilling to leave her, Qiao Nian smiled at Lu Zhu and said, “Brother, he’s not heavy. I’ll carry him myself.”

Lu Zhu looked at Qiao Nian’s thin arm, his heart aching. He helped Qiao Nian out. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

There were many people outside the airport. When Lu Zhu and Qiao Nian appeared, they immediately attracted the attention of many people. Many people hurriedly took photos of their “family of three”.

Not only were there ordinary people at the airport, but there were also many paparazzi.

When Qiao Nian and Lu Zhu left the airport, the two of started trending.

“Eldest Young Master Lu got married in secret and had children!”

Lu Zhu got someone to send Qiao Nian straight to the Gu family villa.

Matriarch Gu had received news that Qiao Nian was coming back. She had been waiting since early in the morning.

When Qiao Nian got out of the car with Xiao Bao in her arms, she saw Matriarch Gu walking out happily. When she smiled, many fine lines appeared on her face.

Matriarch Gu’s hair had turned much whiter, and her mental state was not as good as last year.

She and Gu Zhou had not been away for long, and Grandma’s hair had turned so much white.

Qiao Nian felt a little sad. Grandma was already so old. How could Bai Hui be so heartless as to come and snatch the two children away?

“Grandma!” Qiao Nian smiled and waved at Matriarch Gu, looking happy.

Matriarch Gu was wearing glasses. When she walked up to Qiao Nian, she examined her carefully. Seeing that Qiao Nian had lost weight, she said worriedly, “Didn’t you eat well over there? Why have you lost so much weight?”

Qiao Nian gave a sweet smile and said, “Grandma, being skinny has been trending online recently. Do you think I’m prettier than before?”
