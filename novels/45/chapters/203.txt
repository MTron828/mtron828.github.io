Wang Miao was a little stunned. She didn’t know how to react.

Just as she was about to explain, she felt the air around her turn cold, as if she was trapped in hell. Her eyes couldn’t help but turn red. “No, Second Young Master, I…”

Before Wang Miao could finish speaking, Gu Zhou questioned, “Are you cursing me?”

At this moment, Wang Miao had no time to explain. She hurriedly threw the blessing bag out of the study. As tears rolled down her face in fear and trepidation, she tried to explain, “No, no, Second Young Master, I really don’t know what the blessing bag meant. I always thought that it was just to bless and protect one’s family. I…”

“Who asked you to copy her embroidery? It’s shameful to plagiarize!” Suppressing his anger, Gu Zhou continued, “And you’ve made such a poor copy. Didn’t I warn you before? Don’t you have a brain?”

Wang Miao suddenly recalled how the snake had felt wrapped around her neck. Her legs gave way and she collapsed to the ground.

Gu Zhou’s patience had run out. He said coldly, “Get lost!”

Wang Miao looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief. Looking at Gu Zhou’s cold expression, she instantly understood what he meant. Crying, she begged, “Second Young Master, you can’t send me away. Mom and Dad will be upset. If Sister finds out…”

“Did your parents instruct you to become my mistress, or to break up my marriage? If your sister knew that you were thinking about me that way, I’m sure she’d be so angry that she’d find a way to crawl up from hell just to settle scores with you!”

Wang Miao’s body swayed!

“Hang your blessing bag in front of your sister’s grave. Don’t contaminate my home!”

Wang Miao’s tears fell as she argued, “No, Sister doted on me the most. She gave me everything. If Sister finds out that you chased me away, she’ll definitely be upset!”

“Since she doted on you so much and gave in to you in every way possible, then she can give in to you in the matter of death as well. You’ll go to hell in her place and let her live!” Gu Zhou said mercilessly.

Wang Miao wanted to say something, but was abruptly pulled out of the room by the butler.

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on the blessing bag beside the study door. He walked over with a dark expression and kicked the blessing bag away without hesitation.

All the dirty things were now gone. Gu Zhou closed the study door, feeling much better.

Gu Zhou walked back to the desk, his gaze falling on the computer screen.

“The Qiao Corporation is in danger. A mysterious buyer is purchasing a large number of shares in the Qiao Corporation. The Qiao Corporation is in danger. The chairman is about to be replaced!”

Leaning back in his chair, Gu Zhou narrowed his eyes. After some thought, he gave Chen Qing a call.

“Second Young Master!”

“Who’s purchasing the shares of the Qiao Corporation?”

“I think it’s the former chairman of the Nianxing Group.”

Gu Zhou had heard of the former chairman of the Nianxing Corporation. However, because the company was a small enterprise, he had not paid much attention to it.

“Get me an appointment with the former chairman of the Nianxing Group,” Gu Zhou said after some thought.

Hearing Gu Zhou’s words, Chen Qing was slightly stunned. He hesitated for a moment and said awkwardly, “Second Young Master, the former chairman of the Nianxing Group has always been elusive. The last time he made an appearance was when he bought the Third Mental Hospital with Mr. Fang. He hired many psychiatrists, and helped many patients get better. After that, he disappeared…”

Hearing Chen Qing’s words, Gu Zhou paused for a moment and asked, “Which hospital did you say it was?”

“The Third Mental Hospital!”

Gu Zhou’s mind raced. “The mental hospital Qiao Nian used to stay in?”

“Yes, sir.”

Gu Zhou’s slender fingers tapped lightly on the table. His expression changed slightly. “Continue.”

“Um…” Chen Qing didn’t understand what Gu Zhou was thinking about just now, but he quickly continued, “I’ve already asked someone to contact the former chairman of the Nianxing Group, but I couldn’t even get hold of his secretary.”

“If you can’t get me an appointment, you won’t need to come back.” Gu Zhou hung up without hesitation.

Chen Qing sat at the desk in his office, listening to the dial tone of the phone. Confusion was written all over his face.

Strange.

What was wrong with Second Young Master today?

Had he swallowed gunpowder?
