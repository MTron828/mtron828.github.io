1535 Trouble

Qiao Nian pondered for a moment. Europe should be quite suitable for the growth of the Colorful Fungus. After all, at the same latitude, the climate didn’t differ much. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

If she went to pick the fungus, she should be able to pick it.

After Qiao Nian thought it through, she looked up at the President with a serious expression and said, “Mr. President, I want to take a look and see if I can pick Colorful Fungus. If I can’t, then please be prepared to bring Madam President to Country Z.”

If there were no Colorful Fungus in Europe, they could only go to Country Z.

The president was in a dilemma. He did not want to take Shen Mei to Country Z, worried that there would be other changes.

Fortunately, things had yet to reach this point. The president said heavily, “Doctor Qiao, I’ve really troubled you with Madam’s illness!”

Qiao Nian could tell that the president was unwilling to bring Madam President to Country Z. She smiled politely and said, “This is what I should do. Mr. President, you don’t have to be so polite. I’ll study the environment in Europe and find a place that’s suitable for the growth of the Colorful Fungus first. When the time comes, I’ll go there to take a look. I’ll take my leave first.”

The president narrowed his eyes, hiding the complicated emotions in them. He looked at Lina and said, “Lina, send Doctor Qiao back.”

Lina nodded readily, then took Qiao Nian’s arm and left.

The President watched as the two of them left. His thin lips were pursed tightly, and there was a trace of disbelief in his eyes.

Lina and Qiao Nian walked out of the palace. When they reached the corner, Lina heaved a sigh of relief and said softly to Qiao Nian, “Nian Nian, take me with you to pick herbs!”

Qiao Nian frowned at Lina.

To be honest, she didn’t want to bring Lina along. Colorful Fungus grew on cliffs, and that place was very dangerous. She subconsciously wanted to refuse, but she saw Lina looking at her seriously.

“This…” Qiao Nian asked hesitantly, “Are you sure you want to go?”

Lina nodded vigorously, a trace of sorrow flashing in her eyes. “Nian Nian, although I don’t know where the Colorful Fungus is, I only know that I want to save my mother.”

Lina paused for a moment and continued, “You’re a doctor. You’re going to pick the colorful fungus for my mother. I also want to find the Colorful Fungus as soon as possible. I don’t want you to suffer alone. Don’t worry, I won’t cause you trouble.”

Qiao Nian’s words of rejection were stuck in her throat. She looked at Lina’s sincere gaze and her trust in her. She smiled and said softly, “It’s getting late. When I find the suitable area, we’ll go together.”

Lina’s eyes seemed to light up. Her lips curved up as she said, “Yes, Nian Nian, thank you.”

As she spoke, she reached out and hugged Qiao Nian, her eyes filled with gratitude.

…

In the evening.

The incandescent lights in the interrogation room emitted a cold light. Annie leaned against the wall in a sorry state, her eyes slightly narrowed.

At this moment, the door to the interrogation room opened. The man delivering food was the same man who had delivered food to Annie previously.

He should have gotten off work and gone home, but he recalled what Annie had said previously. For some reason, he took over the task of delivering food.

The guards had all gone to the next room to prepare dinner. They believed that it was impossible for Annie to escape the interrogation room, because she was tied up in chains. The chains were connected to a password key, which only the President knew.

Besides, they could see the situation at the door outside the interrogation room from the window and knew what was going on.

While the other guards were not paying attention, the man slipped into the interrogation room. He watched as Annie sat on the only chair in the interrogation room, her right leg crossed over her left, looking arrogant.

When Annie saw who it was, her lips curved up slightly. She said elegantly and calmly, “You’re still here.”

The man looked at Annie. Even though Annie was covered in injuries and some parts of her face were swollen, she still sat there like a high and mighty princess.

The man frowned slightly. He looked at Annie and quickly stepped forward. With a cold expression, he said, “You’re thinking too much. It’s just my turn to deliver food. This is your dinner. Eat early. You might never have a chance to eat it again.”

As he spoke, the man placed the tray of food on the ground.
