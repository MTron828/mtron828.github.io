Chapter 556: Leader

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Seeing the anger in her eyes and the cold aura around her, the butler felt a strong sense of oppression. He didn’t dare to refuse.

It seemed that Matriarch Lin was right. Second Young Master was born to be a high and mighty leader.

If there came a day when Eldest Young Master really could not return, Second Young Master left because of this illness, and Matriarch Gu died of old age, Second Young Madam would definitely not let the Gu family decline.

Second Young Madam had the ability to do so. Perhaps this was why Matriarch Gu liked Young Madam.

The butler nodded and replied, “Yes!”

Qiao Nian retracted her gaze coldly and walked towards the second floor with the medicine in her hand.

No matter what Jiang Yue was up to behind the scenes, as long as she stayed in the Gu family villa for a day, she would never let Jiang Yue get close to Grandma again, nor let Jiang Yue hurt anyone in the Gu family.

When Qiao Nian arrived at the bedroom, she saw Gu Zhou sitting by Gu Qi’s bed, looking deep in thought. She didn’t know what he was thinking.

Qiao Nian brought the medicine over to Gu Qi and carefully helped him up from the bed. The coldness in her eyes had long since disappeared, replaced by gentleness and love. She said softly, “Xiao Qi, be good. Take the medicine. You’ll recover after taking it!”

Gu Qi’s eyelashes trembled slightly. Seeing Qiao Nian’s blurry face, he called out in a childish voice, “Mommy…”

Qiao Nian’s grip on Gu Qi faltered slightly. Her grip on the bowl tightened involuntarily. Under the dim yellow light, her knuckles were clearly white.

Gu Zhou, who was sitting at the side, was also stunned.

The two of them looked at Gu Qi in unison.

At this moment, Gu Qi was holding onto Qiao Nian’s wrist, unwilling to let go. It was as if this was the only way he could grab hold of his mother.

His small palm was frighteningly hot. The spot where Gu Qi had grabbed Qiao Nian seemed to have been branded. The burning sensation lingered for a long time.

That warmth traveled from her wrist to her heart. Her face instantly turned pale, and her breathing involuntarily tightened.

Was he calling her his mommy?

For some reason, Qiao Nian felt an emptiness in her heart. Carefully, she hugged Gu Qi tightly and said softly, “Xiao Qi, take your medicine quickly!”

Gu Qi was still in a daze from the fever. At this moment, he did not forget to nod.

Qiao Nian carefully fed the medicine in her hand to Gu Qi.

After Gu Qi finished drinking the medicine, he licked his dry lips. His eyelashes fluttered like butterfly wings, and his eyes slowly opened a crack. There was a layer of mist in them.

He tried hard to open his eyes to see what his mother looked like, but his eyelids were too heavy. He couldn’t open them no matter what. He could only feel the warmth of her embrace.

Moreover, there was something about her that made him feel at ease. Her voice was also very pleasant to the ear…

Gu Qi pursed his lips. Medicine was bitter, but the medicine his mother fed him was sweet.

Had his mommy finally found him?

“Mommy…” Gu Qi whispered again.

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Qi’s words, her heart skipped a beat. Her eyes began to water uncontrollably.

She could hear the fear and unease in Gu Qi’s words, as well as his cautiousness. He was only a child who was less than five years old, but his greeting was filled with too many emotions.

Qiao Nian’s eyes turned red.

It seemed that he really missed his mommy. She had to work hard to help him find his mommy.

Gu Qi didn’t get a response. He frowned like a kitten searching for a female cat. “Mommy…” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Qiao Nian felt terrible, and the pain was getting worse and worse. She didn’t want to disappoint Gu Qi, nor did she want him to be disappointed. Hence, she agreed. “Okay, Mommy will stay here and watch over you!”
