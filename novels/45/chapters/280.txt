Chapter 281: Seductress

With that, Xia Xue glanced at Gao Lin, who was standing at the side. Gao Lin instantly understood what Xia Xue meant and stepped forward.

Gao Lin gave an obedient smile and said apologetically, “Brother Cao, I’m really sorry for disturbing you. We’ll leave now.”

“There’s no need. It’s good that you’re here.” Brother Cao stopped Gao Lin, then his gaze fell on Xia Xue’s face. He smiled and asked, “How’s your music score practice?”

Hearing Brother Cao’s question, Xia Xue’s heart jumped to her throat. However, she still pretended to be calm and said with a smile, “Brother Cao, don’t worry. I’ve been practicing hard. On the day of the concert, I’ll definitely accompany Mr. Dong Hua in my best state.”

When Brother Cao heard Xia Xue’s words, he nodded in satisfaction and said, “It’s great that you have such an idea. Take the opportunity since there are so many future big shots in the industry, and let everyone admire your playing.”

Hearing Brother Cao’s words, the onlookers immediately cheered.

“Sure, sure. We just heard Qiao Nian play the violin. Now, we can listen to Senior Xia Xue play the violin. The two of you can compete!”

“Wow, this is like a fight between immortals. My ears are blessed today!”

“I think Senior Xia Xue will definitely play the violin better than Qiao Nian. After all, Senior Xia Xue is a female musician hand-picked by Mr. Dong Hua!”

“Who knows? Qiao Nian’s performance of Missing Someone just now was really good. I almost cried.”

“Senior, don’t hold back. You have to play the best tune!”

Xia Xue felt a little uneasy as she listened to the onlookers. She knew her own capabilities very well. Even if she practiced diligently, she knew very well that she was still inferior to Qiao Nian.

If everyone present was an outsider, she would have just casually fooled around with them. However, everyone present was from the industry. They still had a basic ability to evaluate musicality.

Xia Xue’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. She saw Qiao Nian find a seat and sit down comfortably, looking like she was waiting for her performance.

Before this, Xia Xue would definitely play a song for everyone very confidently, because she felt that she played it well.

When Brother Cao heard his classmates say the words “Qiao Nian”, he asked curiously, “Who is this Qiao Nian you’ve been talking about?”

“That’s her!”

Everyone turned to look at Qiao Nian.

“Her performance of Missing just now was very good.”

“I almost cried!”

“That’s why we’re looking forward to Senior Xia Xue and Qiao Nian competing on the same stage!”

…

Brother Cao looked in the direction everyone was looking at and saw a young lady sitting elegantly at the side. When the young lady saw him, she nodded slightly.

Brother Cao’s expression froze.

Were there so many beauties in the Music Academy?

Previously, he had already thought that Xia Xue was very stunning, but Qiao Nian was even more stunning.

She sat there indifferently, exuding a cynical aura. The smile on her face made one feel her confidence.

This was the person Mr. Dong Hua had asked him to pay attention to!

Brother Cao narrowed his eyes. The previous woman who asked him to pay attention to Mr. Dong Hua drugged him and tried to climb into his bed. In the end, she was beaten half to death and thrown out.

This time, he had thought that Mr. Dong Hua had taken a liking to some young lady. However, when he saw this young lady, he instantly understood.

This young lady must have some agenda. Look at those beautiful fox-like eyes. She’s seducing people all the time.

Brother Cao’s heart skipped a beat!

This wouldn’t do. This kind of vixen was too terrifying.

No wonder Mr. Dong Hua had asked him to keep an eye on her.

It seemed that this young lady had no fate with music in her life. If she offended Mr. Dong Hua, she would definitely suffer in the future!

Sigh, he had thought that Mr. Dong Hua had found someone he liked. It seemed that he was wrong.
