Matriarch Lu let go and looked at Lu Zhu gently. “Fortunately, Senior Brother Qi Qi took care of Qi Qi. Without him, I wonder if Qi Qi…”

Towards the end, Matriarch Lu’s voice choked as she said sadly, “It’s just that this child is so seriously injured. During this period of time, we have to take care of him and thank him properly. He was the one who saved Qi Qi. If it weren’t for him, we might never have seen Qi Qi again.”

Lu Zhu’s long eyelashes drooped, and his eyes darkened. If he wasn’t wrong, that person was very likely still thinking about Qi Qi!

“Grandma, I have something to say.” With that, Lu Zhu glanced at Lu Nian and Gu Zhou.

Lu Nian looked around the room to see if anyone was here.

Gu Zhou walked naturally to the living room door and casually closed it.

Lu Nian went upstairs and checked each room. When he arrived at his parents’ room, he was about to push the door open and enter when it opened from the inside.

Su Yan opened the door with red eyes. She looked at Lu Nian and asked softly, “Why are you back? How’s Mr. Qin?”

“Mr. Qin is already out of danger. We have a major discovery now. Let’s go down and talk,” Lu Nian said with a serious expression.

Su Yan’s beautiful eyes narrowed slightly. She nodded and walked out.

From behind, Su Yan’s footsteps were a little light. It was obvious that she had been frightened by Qi Qi’s incident.

Only their family was left in the living room on the first floor.

Matriarch Lu looked at the three juniors frowning and asked curiously, “What are you doing?”

Su Yan tried hard to maintain her usual elegance and composure. When she heard Matriarch Lu’s words, she also looked at the three juniors sitting opposite her, her eyes filled with confusion.

“Grandma and Mom, what I’m about to say next is very important. You have to be mentally prepared.” Lu Zhu’s expression was serious as he enunciated each word clearly. “Qi Qi wasn’t an accident this time. Someone in the family wanted Qi Qi’s life!”

“What?” Su Yan’s face suddenly turned pale. She stood up excitedly and raised her voice.

“Mom, don’t be agitated. Keep your voice down. Don’t let anyone else know about this.” Lu Nian reminded her, “Does anyone else know that Qi Qi went to pay respects to her ancestors?”

Su Yan panted heavily, her eyes red. She slowly sat back down and said with a frown, “When she found out that she was going to acknowledge Old Master Qin as her master, she was overjoyed. She told everyone at the dining table about this. Later on, everyone in the family found out. Fortunately, she didn’t go out. Otherwise, everyone in the world would know.”

When Lu Zhu heard Su Yan’s words, a trace of confusion flashed in his eyes. “Aren’t only the people in the kitchen that night aware of these things?”

When Matriarch Lu heard Lu Zhu’s words, she sighed softly and said, “This is a good thing. At noon today, the chef in the kitchen wanted to cook Qi Qi’s favorite dishes, but Uncle Zhao told me that Qi Qi had gone out. It happened to be noon, and there were many people in the kitchen. Word spread like wildfire. Soon, everyone in the family knew.”

When Gu Zhou heard Matriarch Lu’s words, he frowned and asked, “Grandma, how long has Uncle Zhao been in the Lu family?”

Everyone’s gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face. They realized that Gu Zhou was suspecting Uncle Zhao.

Gu Zhou said, “If only a few people know Qi Qi’s itinerary, we’ll suspect those people. However, Uncle Zhao told the kitchen staff about Qi Qi’s itinerary. Logically speaking, he just has to say that Lu Qi went out. From another perspective, if he wants to hide the fact that he told others about Qi Qi’s itinerary, would he let more people know so that we would reduce our suspicion of him?” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

When Su Yan heard Gu Zhou’s words, she nodded thoughtfully. “That’s true, but we can’t rule out the possibility that someone else said it. Therefore, it’ll be even more difficult for us to investigate this matter.”

“It’s like this. He might be trying to fish in troubled waters,” Lu Zhu said in agreement.

Matriarch Lu frowned and shook her head. She said disapprovingly, “It’s not like that. Uncle Zhao is an old man in the family. Back then, when Old Master was still around, he was his secretary. Later on, Old Master retired and stayed at home as the butler. It’s impossible for him to do such a thing.”
