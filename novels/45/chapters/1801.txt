Chapter 1802 - 1802 Smooth

Everyone else toasted Gu Ting and praised him for raising his child well. They also knew that Gu Ting and his son had something to talk about, so they stood up and left.

Gu Ting sat there with his back straight. Even when Gu Zhou came over, he did not do anything. He only exchanged a few pleasantries with the envoys of the other countries.

Gu Zhou sat beside Gu Ting. Seeing that everyone had left, he said softly, “The plan went well. Thank you for being willing to lend me your manpower.”

Last night, Gu Zhou had not rested much. Instead, he had brought Gu Ting’s men to deal with the people guarding Mark on the outside. Otherwise, there might have been several times more people in the hall today.

Gu Ting picked up the teacup in front of him and took a sip. Then, he looked at Gu Zhou and asked, “How’s Nian Nian?”

“She’s not hurt.”Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

After Gu Zhou finished speaking, the two of them stopped, as if they had nothing to say.

Gu Zhou was about to leave when he suddenly thought of something and said, “Big Brother is fine too. Today’s matter is private and Big Brother’s identity is sensitive. Now, he has already left and gone straight to MY.”

When Gu Ting heard Gu Zhou’s words, he lowered his eyes slightly to hide the turbulent waves in them.

No one knew what Gu Ting was thinking.

Seeing that Gu Ting had nothing to say, Gu Zhou frowned slightly and stood up. “I’ll go look for Nian’er.”

“Mm,” Gu Ting replied.

After Gu Zhou left, Gu Ting’s hand that was holding the cup trembled slightly, but he quickly calmed down.

It was almost evening when the wedding banquet ended.

During this period, the president brought Lina to deal with the envoys of the various countries. In the end, the two of them stood at the entrance of Mark’s manor to send everyone off.

After sending off the last envoy, Lina heaved a sigh of relief. She did not hide the anxiety in her eyes.

The President naturally saw through Lina’s mood and said considerately, “You’ve been busy for so long today. You must be tired. Go and rest. Just let the Secretary-General do the finishing touches.”

Lina wanted to leave too. Now that she heard the President say this, she was so happy that she could not close her mouth. She asked for a car and stepped on the accelerator to rush to the hospital in the palace.

At the hospital.

Qiao Nian and Dr. Ollie came out of the emergency room. Then, the doctors and nurses pushed Chen Qing out of the hospital bed and sent him to the ward beside them.

Seeing this, Gu Zhou quickly stepped forward and asked worriedly, “How’s Chen Qing?”

“He was almost stabbed in the heart, but he’s fine now.” Qiao Nian took off her mask tiredly. As Chen Qing had bled substantially, Qiao Nian could only use silver needles to control Chen Qing’s acupuncture points.

Gu Zhou nodded slightly.

Gu Zhou held Qiao Nian’s hand and walked towards the ward. The two of them sat on the sofa and he poured Qiao Nian a glass of water.

Qiao Nian smiled and took the water. She took a sip and heaved a sigh of relief. Only then did she feel alive.

At this moment, Qiao Nian’s cell phone rang in her pocket. She took it out and saw that it was a message from her eldest senior brother.

Qiao Nian frowned slightly and said, “Eldest Senior Brother is leaving Europe now. I’ll ask about his situation.”

“Alright.”

“Then I’ll go out and call him back.” As Qiao Nian spoke, she stood up and walked out.

She and Gu Zhou could only speak very softly in Chen Qing’s ward. It was better to speak normally on the phone.

Qiao Nian walked to the door of the ward and reached out to open it. She saw a flash of red and almost bumped into Lina.

Qiao Nian quickly turned her body slightly. Seeing that Lina was about to fall, she wrapped her arm around Lina’s waist. “Be careful!”

“Yes, yes.” Lina barely stabilized herself and nodded anxiously. She asked worriedly, “Nian Nian, how’s Chen Qing? I saw him bleed a lot previously. He…”

Lina’s voice choked at the end.

Qiao Nian let go of Lina’s waist and turned to let her in. She explained gently, “He just came back from the operating theater. He’s still resting. Keep your voice down.”
Lina sniffed and nodded aggrievedly.

Qiao Nian said in a voice that only the two of them could hear, “He looked like he was bleeding a lot. I’ve already given him a life-saving pill previously. Later on, Dr. Ollie and I also stitched his wound. Chen Qing’s physique is good. He’ll recover after resting for a few more days.”
