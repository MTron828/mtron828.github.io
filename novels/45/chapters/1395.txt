1396 Indecent Thoughts

Seeing that Lu Qi’s gaze was a little strange, Qin Chuan asked in confusion, “Did we quarrel?”

Lu Qi shook her head in a daze. She just didn’t expect Senior to think that the two of them were husband and wife.

Moreover, Senior Brother’s expression was very serious now, as if he wasn’t joking at all. She looked into his eyes, and she could only see her face in his obsidian-like eyes.

Her steady heartbeat instantly broke down. It beat violently, as if it was trying to break free from her chest.

Qiao Nian frowned unhappily. She now knew that Qin Chuan had improper thoughts about her sister. Now that he had lost his memory, Qin Chuan actually thought that he and Lu Qi were husband and wife. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Her sister was still a child, okay!

Qiao Nian gripped the wheelchair tightly. All she wanted to do now was push Qin Chuan away!

But in the end, Qiao Nian took a deep breath and tried hard to suppress her displeasure.

Song Yu had yet to recover from her shock. She stood there blankly. Seeing Lu Qi’s body sway, she quickly walked over and helped her up. In a low voice, she said, “Qi Qi, you haven’t recovered yet. You’re still a little anemic. You should rest well in bed.”

When Lu Qi heard Song Yu’s words, she hurriedly looked away and said softly, “Yes, yes, Sister Song Yu.”

Lu Qi’s face had already turned red from head to toe. She was like a cooked prawn.

Seeing that Lu Qi’s reaction was a little strange, Qin Chuan’s expression darkened slightly.

When Qiao Nian heard Qin Chuan’s words, she retracted her gaze from Lu Qi’s flushed face. She looked down at Qin Chuan in the wheelchair and said, “Senior Brother, I’ll push you back to rest!”

With that, Qiao Nian looked at Lu Qi. “Qi Qi, go to bed early. It’s getting late.”

“Alright, Sister. See you tomorrow.” Lu Qi noticed the smile in Qiao Nian’s eyes and looked away with a red face. With Song Yu’s help, she quickly walked towards her room.

Qiao Nian pushed Qin Chuan back to his ward.

When they returned to his ward, Qin Chuan frowned and asked, “Qi Qi and I aren’t married yet?”

He could naturally tell that Lu Qi was shy just now. This meant that the two of them were not married. He did not understand why he had not married Qi Qi.

Qiao Nian helped Qin Chuan onto the bed. Seeing him lie down, she said, “Qin Chuan, I really didn’t expect you to be so secretive. You actually didn’t say anything. When you remember everything, I’m curious about when you fell for my sister, Qi Qi.”

Qin Chuan said calmly, “No matter what, as long as I see her, I’ll fall in love with her at first sight.”

When Qiao Nian heard Qin Chuan’s words, she couldn’t help but roll her eyes. “You’re so straightforward.”

“This is called honesty.” Qin Chuan smiled faintly.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips slightly. At this moment, her phone rang. She opened it and saw that it was a message from Song Yu, saying that she had something to tell her.

“Senior, rest first. I’ll go out for a while. I’ll be back later.” With that, Qiao Nian took her phone and went out. She saw Song Yu standing at the door of Lu Qi’s ward.

When Song Yu saw Qiao Nian coming out, she walked towards her anxiously. She looked around and said in a low voice, “Sister, my eyelids keep twitching. I have a bad feeling that something will happen tonight. Can you find more people to guard Qi Qi?”

Qiao Nian looked at Song Yu’s serious expression and said, “I’ve already arranged for someone to guard Qi Qi. Don’t worry.”

“No, I keep feeling that those people aren’t enough.” Song Yu frowned slightly. She pursed her lips and looked at Qiao Nian. “The more people, the better.”

“Do you know something?” Qiao Nian looked at Song Yu and asked tentatively.

Song Yu pursed her lips tightly, the anxiety in her eyes obvious. She shook her head stubbornly.

“Hm?” Qiao Nian raised her eyebrows slightly.

“Sister, something happened to Qi Qi today. I found someone who knows divination. She said that Qi Qi will have a disaster in the next month. I think it’s better to believe it than not. It’s definitely not wrong to find more people to guard Qi Qi,” Song Yu lied sincerely.
