Chapter 1787 - 1787 Be Careful (1)

Therefore, there was a mess beside the president. The president stared at the people rushing up with a serious gaze and gestured for his people to control them.

On the stage, Lina was much safer. The emcee had already been kicked off the stage by Qiao Nian. As for Wright, he sat on the ground in a daze like a puppet.

Chen Qing had already rushed to Lina’s side. When he saw someone climbing up to grab Lina, he immediately kicked that person away.

They were now standing on the stage and ignored by many people. There were very few people who wanted to climb up the stage. Even if they did, they were sent flying by Chen Qing and Qiao Nian.

Some people still wanted to shoot Chen Qing and Qiao Nian to death, but they were afraid that others would take advantage of them if they caught Lina, so they could only give up on the idea of shooting.

Lina looked worriedly at the president, who was not far away. Her frown deepened. There were more and more people around her father. At this rate, she was worried that her father would be hurt.

She subconsciously grabbed Chen Qing’s arm, who was standing beside her. Her eyes were red with anxiety, and she quickly said, “Chen Qing, I’m not in much danger here. They only want to catch my father now. Mr. Gu seems to be struggling too. I’m worried that they won’t be able to hold on. Go and help!”

When Chen Qing heard Lina’s words, he nimbly kicked the person in front of him off the stage. He looked up at Gu Zhou, who was not far away, and his heart rose to his throat nervously.

He was Gu Zhou’s personal bodyguard. In the past, he had always stood in front of Gu Zhou and protected him at all costs.

However, this time, Second Young Master had arranged for him to come and protect Lina from the beginning because he knew that he cared a lot about Lina.

Originally, they had arranged this because they thought that many people might come to capture Lina. However, there were not many people who wanted to capture Lina now.

Should he protect Second Young Master or Lina?

For a moment, Chen Qing hesitated, not knowing what to choose.

Just as Chen Qing was feeling conflicted, Qiao Nian, who had just dealt with an enemy, walked over. She said to Chen Qing, “Stay here and protect Lina. I’ll protect Mr. Gu. Don’t worry.”

Qiao Nian’s words changed their plans and resolved Chen Qing’s worries.

Chen Qing still trusted Second Young Madam very much. He nodded. “Be careful.”

“Okay.”Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

After dealing with the enemy who was rushing over, Qiao Nian moved towards Gu Zhou bit by bit.

Most of the people who wanted to capture the president were people brought by Cui Huai. Those people had climbed out of death and were all agile. Even if the bodyguards beside the president were good, there were too many people on the other side. They gradually felt powerless.

Gu Zhou was very skilled, but he was exhausted by the other party’s continuous attacks. He frowned.

Some of Cui Huai’s subordinates were fighting with their allies. Those people were still fighting ferociously with others and could not reach them for a while.

Gu Zhou watched as his companions were defeated by the other party one by one. His expression became more and more solemn. The president’s current situation was really too dangerous.

Gu Zhou could only rely on himself. His eyes were filled with ferocity. His smooth fighting moves made those people not dare to approach him.

It wasn’t easy for Qiao Nian to reach Gu Zhou’s side. Even though Gu Zhou was fighting, his actions still exuded elegance.

When Qiao Nian finally squeezed to Gu Zhou’s side, she lowered her voice and asked, “Have you all eaten before?”

“Yes.”

“That’s good,” Qiao Nian replied and took out a gun.

When Cui Huai’s men saw the gun, they subconsciously took a step back. They wanted to shoot, but they were afraid of injuring the president, so they could only give up.

The next moment, Qiao Nian fired at those people.

Bang!

Cui Huai’s men immediately dodged, but they realized that no one had been shot. They saw that the air was filled with white smoke.

This was the fog bomb that Qiao Nian had asked Gu Zhou to make. It contained her homemade paralysis medicine. Anyone who smelled the powder would gradually become numb. It would probably take 10 minutes for them to collapse.
