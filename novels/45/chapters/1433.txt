1434 No Dating

Qin Chuan’s face appeared in Lu Qi’s mind. She also realized that Qin Chuan was a special existence to her.

Lu Nian had also heard about Qin Chuan from Lu Zhu. He frowned slightly and said seriously, “Qi Qi, you’re studying medicine. You should study hard. If you don’t do well, who will dare to look for you for treatment in the future? Let’s put dating aside for now. You have to focus on your studies now!”

Lu Qi nodded obediently.

Su Yan looked at Lu Zhu and Lu Nian in confusion. Usually, the two of them had never cared about Qi Qi being in a relationship. Why were they so concerned now?

Could it be that Lu Qi had someone she liked?

At the thought of this, Su Yan frowned slightly and asked solemnly, “Qi Qi, are you already in a relationship?”

When Lu Qi heard Su Yan’s words, she immediately shook her head and said, “Mom, you’re thinking too much. Who am I dating?”

Although Lu Qi denied being in a relationship, her heart was in a mess.

She wasn’t in a relationship but she had just been confessed to by Senior.

Being confessed to shouldn’t be considered dating, right?

When Su Yan heard Lu Qi’s words, she nodded slightly. As long as she wasn’t in a relationship. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Actually, she was not worried about Lu Qi at all. Lu Qi had four brothers who were older than her. Her brothers would definitely take good care of her.

Qiao Nian stood beside her cell phone, listening to her family warn Lu Qi not to fall in love. She sighed helplessly.

It seemed that if Old Qin wanted to be with Lu Qi, there was really a long way to go.

Qiao Nian’s gaze landed on Gu Zhou’s face.

If not for the matter between her and Gu Zhou six years ago, it would probably be very difficult for Gu Zhou to marry her now.

The rest of the Lu family moved closer to the phone and greeted Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou. They chatted for a while more before hanging up.

After hanging up, Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian prepared to take a shower and rest. As Qiao Nian was going to climb Bear Mountain with Lina tomorrow morning, the two of them rested early.

Qiao Nian lived in the northern district while Lina lived in the western district. As the main road was close to the northern district, the two of them had long agreed that Lina would come and look for Qiao Nian.

After taking a shower, the two of them lay leisurely on the bed. Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian in his arms and said softly, “Do you like Lina a lot?”

Although Gu Zhou was asking, his tone was very certain.

Qiao Nian turned to look at Gu Zhou and wrapped her arms around his neck. Smiling, she said, “You’ve discovered me!”

“Haven’t you already found out that her father might be the one who planned the kidnapping twenty years ago? You should be wary of her,” Gu Zhou said calmly. He hoped that Qiao Nian would keep a distance from Lina.

“We women believe in our sixth sense the most. I think I’ll become good friends with Lina.” Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou with a smile, her red lips curving up slightly. She said softly, “Moreover, I think Lina has an innocent personality and is suitable to be friends with. If her father is really the person who kidnapped me, I might have to draw the line between us.”

Qiao Nian paused for a moment and continued, “But no one knows who kidnapped me twenty years ago. Why worry about something you don’t know?”

Seeing the smile on Qiao Nian’s face, Gu Zhou moved slightly closer to her face and planted a gentle kiss on her forehead. Only then did he say, “Alright, but I might not be able to accompany you tomorrow. When the time comes, I’ll get Chen Qing to follow you and protect you!”

Seeing Qiao Nian open her mouth, Gu Zhou knew that she was going to refuse. His expression turned serious. Without waiting for Qiao Nian to speak, he added, “This time, you can’t refuse me!”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she didn’t insist anymore. She just smiled faintly.

Gu Zhou pulled Qiao Nian into his arms and gently patted her back. In a low and hoarse voice, he said, “It’s getting late. Go to sleep!”

“Yes!”

Gu Zhou turned off the lights in the room. White moonlight filtered through the gaps in the curtains, as if it had been covered in a layer of silver frost.

Under the moonlight, Qiao Nian’s gentle sleeping face gave off a peaceful feeling.
