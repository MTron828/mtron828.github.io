“Second Sister-in-law, you’re really amazing, If there’s anything I don’t understand in the future, I’ll consult you again.” Zhao Qian looked at Qiao Nian admiringly.

“You don’t have to stand on ceremony.” Qiao Nian felt a little uncomfortable under Zhao Qian’s gaze. Smiling, she lowered her head and continued to apply the medicine.

“Second Sister-in-law, go ahead. I’ll take the candied plums to Grandma.” Zhao Qian smiled at Qiao Nian.

“Okay.”

After Zhao Qian left, Qiao Nian put alll the ingredients into the drawer.

She glanced at the pot of medicinal herbs next to her. The medicine in it was almost done brewing. She stuffed all the ingredients into a medicine packet, then carried the pot to Gu Zhou’s room.

Gu Zhou was about to rest when he smelled the scent of Chinese medicine. He frowned and asked, “What are you doing?”

“A medicinal bath!” Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou with a smile. He was wearing a white shirt and well-tailored trousers, accentuating his tall figure.

Although Qiao Nian was a person with a pure heart and a chaste mind, when she saw Gu Zhou like this, she couldn’t help but take another look.

“Medicinal bath?” Gu Zhou frowned, his eyes filled with disdain as he looked at the medicine pot.

“Yes, this can alleviate your illness and heighten your metabolism. It’s good for your health.” Qiao Nian pointed to the bathroom and asked with a smile, “Shall I fill the tub for you?”

Seeing that Gu Zhou didn’t object, Qiao Nian tumed around and entered the bathroom.

There was a bathtub in the bathroom. Qiao Nian began to fill the tub with water, then took out the packet of medicine from the medicine pot.

Soon, Qiao Nian had gotten everything ready. Seeing that Gu Zhou had yet to enter, she walked towards the door and saw Gu Zhou sitting on the sofa, looking at his phone.

“Why haven’t you come in? I was waiting for you!” Qiao Nian smiled at Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou’s gaze moved away from the phone screen and landed on Qiao Nian’s face, confusion written all over his face.

“Hurry up and take off your clothes. Come in! Take a bath!” Qiao Nian urged.

Gu Zhou could faintly smell the scent emanating from the bathroom. His brow furrowed deeper and deeper as he said in a displeased voice, “Ask one of the servants to remove it. The smell is too strong!”

“No.” Qiao Nian refused Gu Zhou’s suggestion without hesitation. “These medicinal ingredients are very expensive, and I’ve brewed it specially for you. We mustn’t waste it!”

With that, Qiao Nian walked towards Gu Zhou and reached out to grab his hand. “Quickly!”

Sitting on the sofa, Gu Zhou looked up at Qiao Nian, his gaze fixed on her, his eyes clear and deep.

Qiao Nian was worried that the temperature of the bath would drop, which would affect its medicinal properties. Seeing that she couldn’t drag Gu Zhou to the bathroom, she gave up and began unbuttoning Gu Zhou’s shirt without hesitation.

In no time, she had removed Gu Zhou’s shirt.

Gu Zhou’s skin was very fair, perhaps because he had been ill for a long time and had not spent much time under the sun. However, his figure was exquisite. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Beneath his Adam’s apple was a pair of well-defined collarbones. The lines defining his chest were perfect and smooth. Further down was his Adonis belt

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but swallow.

“Doctor Qiao?” Gu Zhou’s voice was low and pleasant to the ear. His voice rose slightly as he looked at her with interest.

Qiao Nian came back to her senses. She coughed awkwardly and quickly stood to the side, remaining quiet.

She was a doctor.

In the eyes of a doctor, all patients had to be the same, regardless of gender.

She couldn’t allow herself to become infatuated with Gu Zhou’s good looks and figure.

Qiao Nian lowered her head and looked away, thinking that she couldn’t look at Gu Zhou anymore.

“Doctor Qiao, aren’t you going to help me take off my trousers?” Gu Zhou raised his eyebrows slightly and teased.

Qiao Nian walked towards the bathroom. When she reached the door, she saw that Gu Zhou had not yet arrived. She hurriedly urged, “Come in quickly, don’t waste time!”

Although she looked calm on the surface, she was actually very anxious.

She didn’t want Gu Zhou to think that she was a hooligan or a pervert. Otherwise, the reputation she had worked so hard to build would be ruined.

Seeing that Gu Zhou had not moved, Qiao Nian looked up..
