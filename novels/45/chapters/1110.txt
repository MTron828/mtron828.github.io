1111 Medical Genius

Jiang Chi’s face slowly appeared in Qiao Nian’s mind. He looked very monstrous, but on the surface, his face looked very gentlemanly. However, if one looked carefully at his eyes, they would see the aura of death!

If Qiao Nian remembered correctly, Jiang Chi didn’t study medicine. Those ten questions definitely weren’t set by Jiang Chi.

However, Jiang Cheng studied medicine. Could it be Jiang Cheng who set the questions?

Did Grandpa know Jiang Cheng?

!!

No, it shouldn’t be from Jiang Cheng. It was impossible for Grandpa to leak such an important question to outsiders.

After eliminating all the impossibilities, there was only one possibility left. These questions were very likely set by Eldest Senior Brother because he was in MY now.

Qiao Nian’s mind was in a mess. She wrote the answer on a piece of paper, took a photo, and sent it to Lu Qi.

Lu Qi replied very quickly. “Sister, you’re amazing. You solved the question so quickly!”

Qiao Nian hesitated for a moment before sending Lu Qi a message. “Lu Qi, An City has been a little chaotic recently. You have to protect yourself. No matter what danger you encounter, contact me immediately!”

Lu Qi was reading a message from her sister. When she realized that there was a new message on her cell phone, she opened it and smiled.

Her sister was treating her like a child. She had already grown up. After she had almost been kidnapped last time, she was already working hard to learn how to protect herself.

Lu Qi smiled and replied to Qiao Nian’s message. “Sister, I know that you and my brothers will definitely protect me. Moreover, I’ve become powerful now. Ordinary people can’t bully me!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Nian recalled Qin Chuan saying that Jiang Cheng had once participated in the Lu family’s auction. She recalled that Jiang Cheng had been invited to An City by her brother to hang out. “It’s better to be careful. By the way, are you familiar with Jiang Cheng?”

Lu Qi sat on a chair. After recalling seriously, she sent Qiao Nian a message. “Brother Jiang Cheng is very talented in medicine. He’s usually quiet and taciturn. I don’t usually speak to him, but if I don’t know any questions, I’ll ask him. He’ll patiently explain them to me.”

At this point, Lu Qi sighed helplessly. Frowning, she said, “Brother Jiang Cheng is still a very gentle person. Unfortunately, he was killed!”

“Then do you know who killed him?” Qiao Nian asked.

“I don’t know. It seems that he offended someone and was killed by those bad people!” Lu Qi said sadly. “If Brother Jiang Cheng is still alive, he will definitely be a genius in the medical field!”

Qiao Nian could tell that Lu Qi felt sorry for Jiang Cheng’s death. She recalled the Jiang Cheng she had seen in the ice coffin.

Unfortunately, such a peerless man had been killed!

“Sister, I’ve already gotten someone to send Brother Jiang Cheng’s diary to you. He’ll be there in ten minutes!”

“Alright, thank you!” After Qiao Nian finished speaking, she recalled the thread with ten questions. Worried, she instructed, “Lu Qi, there are many bad people outside now. You have to be careful. Don’t talk too much to strangers!”

When Lu Qi heard Qiao Nian’s words, she couldn’t help but laugh. She treated her like a kindergarten student. Listening to her sister’s worried reminders, she could sense her sister’s love for her.

Lu Qi puffed out her chest proudly and said seriously, “Sister, don’t worry. I won’t talk to strangers in the future. I won’t be in danger!”

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Qi’s words, she still felt a little uneasy. Her right eyelid kept twitching, and she had an ominous feeling.

She hoped that she was overthinking!

“Okay, then you should rest early too. Goodnight!”

“Goodnight!”

After Qiao Nian hung up, she looked at the post with a complicated expression, her thoughts gradually drifting away.

After an unknown period of time, Qiao Nian’s thoughts were interrupted by a knock on the door.

She turned to look at the door and said calmly, “Come in!”

The butler pushed open the door and walked in. He said respectfully, “Young Madam, Young Mistress Lu has sent something over!”
