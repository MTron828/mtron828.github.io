Translator: Atlas Studios    Editor: Atlas Studios

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Qi’s words, she smiled and nodded. “Yes, love isn’t everything. Some things can be taken slowly. Time will tell.”

Qiao Nian didn’t want Lu Qi to become a romantic. How could someone who lost herself because she was in a relationship have a good relationship?

She helped Lu Qi untie the knot in her heart and was about to enter the room

when Lu Qi grabbed her arm. She turned to look at Lu Qi in confusion.

With a bright smile on her face, Lu Qi asked curiously, “Sister, how did you get together with Brother-in-law? How were you like before you got together?”

Lu Qi pursed her lips slightly and continued, “Sister is definitely not a romantic. I find it unbelievable that you’re with Brother-in-law.”

Lu Qi, who was in a hazy relationship, was very interested in her sister’s relationship.

Qiao Nian’s eyes were filled with laughter. She said meaningfully, “A lot of things have indeed happened between us, but our situation is a little special. I can’t create a positive example of love for you. Let’s not talk about this!”

“Sister.” Lu Qi took Qiao Nian’s hand and said pitifully, “Sister, shouldn’t you share your love story with your sister?”

Qiao Nian smiled at Lu Qi and said, “When you grow up, or if you’re already with Old Qin, I’ll tell you.”

At the thought that she might be dating in the future, Lu Qi’s ears turned red. She muttered softly, “It’s still early.”

Happy times always passed especially quickly. Qiao Nian played with the three children for the entire afternoon. Everyone wanted more, and before they knew it, the sky had already turned dark.

After taking care of the three children, Qiao Nian returned to her room, took a shower, and lay lazily on the bed.

Just as she was about to sleep, the outside of the bed suddenly sank. She subconsciously wanted to turn around to look at the person, but she did not expect him to lift the blanket.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

A slightly cold hand caressed her back, gradually moving down her spine.

Qiao Nian’s sleepiness instantly dissipated. She reached out and grabbed the restless hand behind her. Just as she was about to turn around, the person grabbed her waist, preventing her from moving.

Qiao Nian smelled the unique fragrance of the person behind her. She smiled and called out helplessly, “Ah Zhou.”

Sensing that Gu Zhou had loosened his grip, she turned around and leaned into his arms, asking vaguely, “l thought you and my brothers were still busy.

I didn’t expect you to be back so early.”

Gu Zhou looked at the sleepy Qiao Nian in his arms and said coldly, “If I had come back any later, you would have fallen asleep.”

Although Gu Zhou’s voice was very gentle, Qiao Nian could hear the trace of displeasure in his words.

Qiao Nian opened her eyes and looked at Gu Zhou. She met Gu Zhou’s scrutinizing eyes and seemed to remember something.

Had she promised Gu Zhou something?

But why couldn’t she remember?

Just as Qiao Nian was still thinking hard, a gentle kiss landed on her forehead.

She was about to hug Gu Zhou to sleep when she heard the man’s cold voice.

“In your heart, what exactly am l?”

Qiao Nian instantly came back to her senses.

Oh, right.

During breakfast this morning, Gu Zhou had asked her to think about this question carefully.

Smiling, she looked up at Gu Zhou. Inadvertently, she met Gu Zhou’s eyes, which were as dark as obsidian. She was almost sucked in by his eyes.

“What’s your answer?” Gu Zhou enunciated each word with a hint of threat.

Qiao Nian wrapped her arm around Gu Zhou’s neck coquettishly and gave him a bright smile. Her voice was soft. “Ah Zhou, I’m sleepy.”

In the next moment, Qiao Nian felt Gu Zhou’s hand gradually lower on her back. She was almost completely awake. She hurriedly said, “Alright, I’ll tell you now.”

As she spoke, Qiao Nian reached out and pulled Gu Zhou’s hand away.

However, Gu Zhou’s grip was very strong. Her small actions could only make Gu Zhou stop moving.

Gu Zhou rested his forehead on Qiao Nian!s. His gaze was sharp, as if he would attack at any moment.. “Answer!”
