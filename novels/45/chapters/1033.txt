1034 Deal With Me Slowly?

Qiao Nian knew that Song Yu had been adopted when she was more than three years old. At that time, Song Yu was still a child. A child had accidentally gone to the wrong place. Second Brother shouldn’t have been calculative with Song Yu.

She was an outsider, so she couldn’t say much.

However, could it be that the relationship between Second Brother and Song Yu had become so cold because of her?

Qiao Nian felt that something was wrong. She thought that there might be other reasons.

!!

When Qiao Nian arrived at the piano room, she was slightly stunned.

This piano room was the one she had once dreamed of. The decorations inside were exactly the same as in her dream.

Strange, Second Brother also had an identical piano room in Big Brother’s company, but this piano room at home was larger.

Some fragmented memories flashed across Qiao Nian’s mind, but she couldn’t remember the details. She vaguely remembered sitting in Second Brother’s arms and listening to him play the piano seriously.

At this moment, Lu Zhu walked over. “Sugar, do you still remember the piano room?”

Before Qiao Nian could speak, Lu Zhu continued, “When you were young, other than in the bedroom, you spent the rest of your time in the piano room!”

When Lu Nian heard Lu Zhu’s words, his eyes were filled with smiles. He looked at Qiao Nian gently. “You said that you like the piano room the most. You even said that you hoped that your house would be as beautiful as the piano room in the future!”

Qiao Nian looked around and smiled. “I only have some fragmented memories now, but I believe that I’ll definitely remember this place in the future and never forget it!”

“Alright, everyone, sit down!” Lu Nian said with a smile. “The exclusive seats I’ve prepared for you are finally taken!”

Lu Nian had specially prepared a row of seats in the corner of the piano room. Usually, other than Lu Qi, who was willing to listen to him play the piano, no one else was willing to come. This was the first time Lu Nian’s piano room was so lively.

Lu Zhu walked naturally to his exclusive seat and sat down. Lu Rao was on Lu Zhu’s right, Lu Jiang was on Lu Rao’s right, and Qiao Nian and Lu Qi were next.

There were only these few exclusive seats.

Qiao Nian was about to sit down when she saw that there was no seat for Gu Zhou. Her eyes met Gu Zhou’s, and she didn’t know what to say.

After a while, Qiao Nian gave a bright smile and said, “Why don’t we sit on the sofa over there?”

The sofa over there was a little further from the piano. The exclusive seats were closer to the piano.

Lu Qi immediately stood up and said, “Brother-in-law, sit on the sofa yourself. I want to sit with Sister.”

Gu Zhou’s eyes darkened.

Lu Qi immediately felt aggrieved. She pouted and said pitifully, “Sister, look. Brother-in-law is being fierce to me now!”

Qiao Nian quickly comforted him. “Don’t be angry. It’s fine, it’s fine. I’ll deal with him when I get back!”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he raised his eyebrows. “Are you planning to go to the Dongjiang villa and slowly deal with me?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Qiao Nian was speechless.

This was too much.

What the hell was this Dongjiang villa!

Could he not mention the Dongjiang villa again?

Everyone knew that he wanted to live in the Dongjiang villa.

Every time Gu Zhou mentioned the Dongjiang Villa, she would think of Gu Zhou with her in bed. That scene was too vivid. She didn’t dare to think about it.

Qiao Nian didn’t say anything else. She pulled Gu Zhou and Lu Qi to the sofa.

Now that they had all sat down, there should be nothing else to say.

Qiao Nian was about to focus on listening to Second Brother play the piano when she felt a few burning gazes on her. She saw that Eldest Brother, Second Brother, Third Brother, and Fourth Brother were all looking at her curiously.

Qiao Nian coughed and said pretentiously, “Second Brother, why aren’t you playing the piano anymore?”

Lu Qi glanced at Lu Nian and instantly understood. She smiled at Qiao Nian and asked softly, “Sister, what’s with the Dongjiang villa?”

“Nothing.” Qiao Nian smiled and looked at Lu Nian, who was not far away. “Second Brother, where’s your new song?”

Lu Qi nodded in realization. Her sister must have a high status in the Gu family. Every time she mentioned the Dongjiang villa, it was her sister’s way of punishing her brother-in-law.
