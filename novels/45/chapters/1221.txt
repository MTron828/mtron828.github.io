After hanging up, Gu Zhou looked at his cell phone nervously, looking forward to Mr. Chen calling back.

Qiao Nian could understand Gu Zhou’s nervousness. She was equally nervous when she reunited with the Lu family.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian reached out and held Gu Zhou’s hand, silently comforting him.

Gu Zhou looked up at Qiao Nian. Seeing the gentleness in her eyes, he grabbed her hand and said softly, “I’ve always thought that Big Brother didn’t like me.”

“You’re his biological younger brother. How can he not like you?” Qiao Nian said gently.

In the past, when Qiao Nian thought that she was a child of the Qiao family, she had always wanted to integrate into the Qiao family. However, no matter what she did, no one in the Qiao family was willing to accept her as family.

When she reunited with her eldest brother, she realized what blood ties were.

At first, Lu Zhu was wary of her and did not have a good impression of her. However, Lu Zhu blocked the bullet for her without hesitation.

Later on, she found out from her brother that he had taken the bullet for her from the bottom of his heart. He had not thought about it at all. He only wanted to protect her.

Even though they had not acknowledged each other, her brother could not help but want to protect her.

Qiao Nian held Gu Zhou’s hand tightly and continued, “Your brother seemed to have been looking for Grandpa. He wanted him to treat your illness.”

Gu Zhou nodded. “There’s a lack of communication between us.”

Qiao Nian recalled how Mr. Chen had smoked yesterday. She pursed her lips slightly and comforted him. “The short parting was for the sake of meeting again in the future.”

Gu Zhou smiled at Qiao Nian and said nothing more.

Time passed bit by bit.

The wait was always long.

Half an hour later, Gu Zhou’s phone rang.

Gu Zhou’s eyes lit up. The caller ID was not a call from Mr. Chen’s assistant. Instead, it was a landline number. This landline number should be local to MY.

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian looked at each other. Gu Zhou let go of Qiao Nian’s hand and picked up the call.

“Hello?”

On the other end of the line, Mr. Chen spoke first. His voice was as calm as ever.

Gu Zhou couldn’t help but grip his cell phone tightly. He pursed his lips slightly, not knowing how to reply.

Qiao Nian gently held Gu Zhou’s hand, signaling for him to speak. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Only then did Gu Zhou come back to his senses and say, “Excuse me, is this Mr. Chen?”

“It’s me.”

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian, who was beside him. Seeing Qiao Nian nod, he seemed to be encouraged. He asked, “Mr. Chen, do you have any thoughts on new energy cars?”

New energy cars was a popular industry worldwide.

“I’m sorry, Mr. Gu. We don’t want to come into contact with new energy cars for the time being.” Mr. Chen refused without hesitation.

When Gu Zhou heard Mr. Chen’s words, his expression changed. This was the first time he had been rejected so bluntly.

Mr. Chen’s voice was different from his brother’s, but his tone reminded him of his brother.

He was almost certain that Mr. Chen was his brother.

With this thought in mind, Gu Zhou asked tentatively, “I heard that Mr. Chen is a busy person. I wonder when you plan to return home after working hard outside for so many years?”

His question was a little vague. He didn’t dare to say it too bluntly, afraid that if someone was spying on Mr. Chen, he might disturb his brother’s plan. He was even more afraid that his brother would be in danger.

However, he thought that if Mr. Chen were his brother, he would definitely answer this vague question.

Mr. Chen’s voice on the phone sounded like a smile. “Mr. Gu, how can someone like me have a home?”

When Gu Zhou heard Mr. Chen’s words, he felt indescribably sad.

Mr. Chen was clearly smiling as he spoke, but he could sense the sorrow in his words.

Gu Zhou was about to ask if he was Gu Yue, but he quickly swallowed his words. He said in a low voice, “Since Mr. Chen has no intention of collaborating with me, I won’t waste your time. I wish you all the best.”
