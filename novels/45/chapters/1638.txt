Chapter 1639 Lost It

They didn't expect Mark to admit it.

Was Mark going to admit that he was the one who had sent Cui Qi to kill the Seventh Princess?

At this moment, Mark said lightly, "But I lost this ring a week ago."

Mark's expression was calm, as if he did not take this matter seriously at all.

The president's expression was as dark as ink. He knew that he couldn't convict Mark now, but he didn't want to see Mark be so at ease in court.

What did he mean by losing the ring?

The ring was often worn on his hand, and this ring was a token of Mark and Cui Qi. How could he throw it away just like that?

"In that case, we have to investigate this matter carefully. For the time being, you'll be detained!" The president looked at Mark coldly and said.

Detained.

Neither Qiao Nian nor Gu Zhou had expected the president to say this. They looked at the president beside them. The president was exuding a cold aura. He was no longer as gentle as he usually was.

It seemed that the president understood what he had to do.

The European royal family was in a mess. In fact, the president was just a name. He did not have much real power. For the sake of the European people, he usually chose to tolerate many things, but he did not expect to have to compromise every time.

But the president now understood that even if he kept holding back, it would be useless. Mark would only push his luck and bully his family.

Wright, who was standing beside Mark, instantly changed his expression. He frowned, his eyes cold as he stared unblinkingly at the president in front of him.

He had never expected the president to be so bold as to ground his father.

The president did not take his father seriously at all.

Wright was about to speak, but when he thought about how this was not a suitable occasion to speak, he could only forcefully suppress his dissatisfaction. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Mark's eyes were dark, like a bottomless lake. There was anger on his face, and his cold gaze was like a big knife that cut through everything.

Mark's gaze fell coldly on the president's face. He enunciated each word clearly. "President, did you say anything just now?"

His voice was cold and oppressive, as if he was questioning the President.

The guards standing beside the president nervously gripped the pistols at their waists. They were all frightened by Mark's aura.

They knew very well how many troops Mark had. They were even more afraid that with a wave of his hand, Mark's guards outside would rush in and completely crush them.

The judge frowned slightly. This was Europe. The president of Europe had absolute authority in some aspects, but Mark was questioning the president directly.

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian were also nervous. The two of them exchanged a look and fell silent.

The president's eyes were cold, as if he was willing to die with Mark in the next moment.

Mark tidied his sleeves and said lightly, "Mr. President, Annie was the one who poisoned Madam President and killed the Seventh Princess. She has already confessed, and I have apologized."

"Annie will be sentenced to death soon. My only daughter is going to die, and your wife and daughter are still alive and well."

The meaning behind Mark's words was obvious. He wanted the president to stop while he was ahead. He wanted him to stop causing trouble.

Seeing that the president was gritting his teeth, Mark took a step forward and said coldly, "Sometimes, one has to know their limits. Don't always fantasize. Think about your limits. Don't hit a rock with an egg."

Mark's voice wasn't loud, but it spread throughout the courtroom.

The temperature in the courtroom instantly dropped. Everyone looked at Mark nervously. None of them had expected Mark to threaten the president at this moment.

The President had already made it very clear just now. If he went back on his word now, he might lose all his face, and he would not be able to maintain control of Europe in the future. Then, Europe would already be in Mark's pocket.

Qiao Nian glanced at the President and Mark. Now, the two powerful figures in Europe were competing. If they really fought here today, she and Gu Zhou would probably not be able to escape unscathed.
