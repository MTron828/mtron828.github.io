1316 Dao Wen Betrayed Them!

Dao Wen had rebelled!

Not only did Ba Song say that Dao Wen had betrayed him, but he also said that Dao Wen had a girlfriend.

Dao Wen’s girlfriend was called Qiao Nian?

Qiao Nian. Why did this name sound a little familiar?

Suddenly, Cui Huai’s expression changed. Wasn’t Qiao Nian Gu Zhou’s wife?

No, Dao Wen was his confidant. He had promoted him single-handedly. How could Dao Song betray him?

Sha He walked in and looked at Chang Feng worriedly. Then, he looked at Chen Quan and said, “Mr. Chen, on the way, we’ve already taken emergency measures for Chang Feng. We need a doctor to remove the bullet from his body.”

After saying that, Sha He noticed that Chen Quan was being held back by the bodyguards. He looked at Cui Huai in confusion. “Mr. Cui, what happened?”

Cui Huai was a little confused. Sha He was not good at lying. Even if Chang Feng bribed Ba Song, it was impossible for Chang Feng to bribe Sha He.

What exactly happened tonight?

Cui Huai was a little stunned. He looked at his bodyguard and a trace of discomfort flashed across his face. “Let him go!”

Chen Quan immediately walked up to Chang Feng and placed him on the sofa. Only then did he notice that Chang Feng’s legs and abdomen were injured. He asked worriedly, “Has the doctor arrived?”

“They’ll be here soon.”

Mr. Chen looked at the others coldly and said, “In that case, send him to the emergency room first and get the doctor to go straight to the emergency room. By the way, get Uncle Zhang to go over and stop Chang Feng’s bleeding first. We have to wait for the doctor to arrive!”

“Yes!”

Butler Zhao nodded and hurriedly called for someone to bring Chang Feng to the emergency room.

This had happened many times, so Mr. Chen had specially set up an emergency room in the villa.

Uncle Zhang was Mr. Chen’s private doctor. His medical skills were very brilliant. With him around, Chang Feng would definitely be fine.

Chang Feng was taken away by Butler Zhao. Chen Quan looked at Ba Song and asked in confusion, “What exactly happened? Why did Dao Wen betray us?”

When Ba Song heard Mr. Chen’s question, he said respectfully, “After the power went out in the hospital, the three of us entered Gu Zhou’s ward directly. We originally planned to kill Gu Zhou and leave. However, when Chen Qing was about to shoot Dao Wen, Qiao Nian asked him to stop and even called him Brother Wen very kindly.”

When Cui Huai heard Ba Song’s words, he frowned and asked anxiously, “Then?”

“I realized that Dao Wen was a traitor. I wanted to shoot him to kill him, but I was stopped by Qiao Nian. Not only that, Qiao Nian even shot me. In order to protect me, Brother Li took a bullet for me!” When Ba Song said this, his eyes instantly turned red. With a tear, he continued, “It wasn’t easy for us to escape, but we were chased by Gu Zhou’s men. In order to save me, Brother Li was shot in the abdomen again. My life was saved by Brother Li!”

When Cui Huai heard Ba Song’s words, he fell silent. Ba Song would not lie. He could not believe that Dao Wen was a traitor.

“Are you saying that Jiao Wen and Qiao Nian were close?” Cui Huai raised his eyebrows slightly, unwilling to give up.

Ba Song’s voice choked as he said, “Yes, Dao Wen often sends messages to Qiao Nian secretly. Not only that, Qiao Nian was also the one who protected Dao Wen this time. It’s precisely because of this that we didn’t have time to kill Gu Zhou. We could only retreat!”

Sha He took the initiative to step forward and say, “Later on, when I passed by Gu Zhou’s ward pretending to be a doctor, I saw Qiao Nian and Dao Wen flirting!”

Flirting?

Cui Huai was so angry that his lips were trembling. He smashed the sofa beside him hard. “Dao Wen!”

Dao Wen, this wretch, actually dared to lie to him!

Cui Huai was so angry that he was panting heavily. He yearned to tear Dao Wen into pieces.

Mr. Chen, who was sitting at the side, was a little stunned. How could Qiao Nian be involved? Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

However, he still looked calm. He glanced coldly at all the bodyguards present, and his gaze finally landed on Cui Huai’s face. He said calmly, “Mr. Cui, did you suspect that I was a spy previously?”

When Cui Huai heard Chen Quan’s voice, he subconsciously looked at him and saw his sharp eyes.

Indeed, Chen Quan had become brave. Now, he even dared to look at him like this!

However, this also made Cui Huai realize that Chen Quan really cared about Chang Feng.
