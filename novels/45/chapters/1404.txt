1405 Anger

When other worms were inserted into a person’s body, they would more or less react to the human body. However, only the Hypnotic worm was different. The Hypnotic worm was only used to change a person’s memories. When a person’s memories were tampered with, it meant that there was a Hypnotic worm in their body. They would absolutely obey everything the person with the mother worm said. Under such circumstances, they would never leak the matter of their master.

The reason why Uncle Zhao had a headache yesterday was because he had forcefully recalled the past. He had suffered the backlash of the Hypnotic worm and fainted from the pain. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Today, Uncle Zhao was sitting there in a daze. In fact, the Hypnotic worm in his body was circulating again. After the Hypnotic worm was successfully circulated, Uncle Zhao would become someone who hated the Lu family again.

Gu Zhou frowned slightly and asked, “Can’t I forcefully awaken his memories?”

“This won’t do. He’ll only faint.” Qiao Nian sighed heavily and continued, “Even if the hypnotist comes, he can only hypnotize Uncle Zhao. There’s no way to hypnotize the worm in Uncle Zhao’s body, unless…”

Qiao Nian paused for a moment and looked up at Gu Zhou. Her eyes flickered with a strange light as she said, “I’ve thought of something. I can try to knock out the worm. When the time comes, I’ll confront Uncle Zhao. That way, we might have a chance to find out who the mastermind is.”

There was a red light ahead. After Gu Zhou stopped the car, he looked at Qiao Nian with admiration, his lips curving up slightly. “Yes, we’ll do as you say.”

Qiao Nian nodded slightly and took out her phone to send Lu Zhu a message. This was something that needed Lu Zhu’s cooperation.

When they returned to the Lu family, Qiao Nian told the Lu family about her latest discoveries. Uncle Zhao, who had yet to regain consciousness, was tied to a chair. The rest of the Lu family sat on the sofa not far away.

Everyone in the living room fell silent. Everyone’s attention was on Qiao Nian, who was taking Uncle Zhao’s pulse.

Uncle Zhao’s eyes gradually lit up. Seeing everyone sitting in front of the sofa and looking at him, his expression instantly darkened. He asked coldly, “Kill me if you want. What are you doing?”

When Auntie Cao heard Uncle Zhao’s words, she was so angry that her lips trembled. She frowned and said, “What nonsense are you spouting again? Why did you suddenly become like this? You clearly said that the Lu family is your family!”

Towards the end, Auntie Cao’s voice choked, and her tears fell uncontrollably. She cried, “This is our family. Qi Qi is also our young lady. How can you…”

The hatred in Uncle Zhao’s eyes did not diminish at all. He said coldly, “Shut up. I told you long ago that the Lu family and I are irreconcilable.”

When Qiao Nian heard Uncle Zhao’s words, she sensed that the Hypnotic worm was throbbing. She took out a silver needle and inserted it one centimeter into Uncle Zhao’s chest without hesitation.

Uncle Zhao’s expression froze for a moment. Then, he blinked and looked at Qiao Nian. “Miss, what did you do to me?”

“You said that your wife was having an affair. When did your wife have an affair?” Without waiting for Uncle Zhao to speak, Qiao Nian continued, “I’ve already asked around. When you went out with Grandpa, your wife was with your mother almost all the time. After you returned home, your wife was with you. Could it be that your wife has a cloning technique that allowed her to appear beside two people at the same time?”

Auntie Cao covered her mouth and stood at the side, tears falling uncontrollably. Previously, Matriarch Cao had said that she could not speak when Eldest Miss asked questions.

Everyone from the Lu family focused their attention on Uncle Zhao’s face, wanting to see something wrong with him.

However, Uncle Zhao still looked fearless. He sneered and questioned, “How do you know that she doesn’t have time to have an affair?”

“I don’t know if she’s having an affair, but I’m just stating a fact. You said that she was having an affair, so you have to show evidence.” At this point, Qiao Nian took out her phone. She lowered her head and scrolled through the screen a few times. “You even said that my grandfather killed her?”

“Yes, Old Master and the chauffeur conspired to kill my wife on purpose so that I could work hard with Old Master. Old Master really never expected me to know the truth.” Uncle Zhao’s eyes were filled with ridicule.
