Chapter 132 The Truth

“Who are you looking for?”

“I’m here to look for my mother. She should be a diamond-tier member here! She even said that she wanted to book a session today and asked me to bring over her bank card.”

Qiao Nian’s smile was very sweet, and her voice was very gentle. Coupled with her exquisitely beautiful face, the man believed her words without a doubt.

“May I know your mother’s name?”

“Su Xue.”

When the young man heard Su Xue’s name, he immediately said with enthusiasm, “So you’re the precious daughter of the Qiao family. Miss Qiao, Madam Su is in Room 19 in the private area reserved for guests. Just follow this path!”

“Thank you.”

“No worries. I’m just doing what I should.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

When Qiao Nian turned around, the smile on her face instantly vanished.

In less than two minutes, Qiao Nian walked to Room 19 in the private area.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on the room number. It was indeed correct.

She pressed her ear against the door. The room seemed to be soundproofed, and she couldn’t hear anything.

This door was locked with a password.

Qiao Nian hurriedly sent a text to Old A, asking him to unlock the password.

In less than two minutes, Old A had broken the password lock and opened the door remotely.

The owner of Feng Yun Gym specialized in private fitness spaces reserved for members of the upper-class society, so the security and privacy of the gymnasium were excellent.

Every room was very spacious, spanning 200 square meters. Qiao Nian walked in carefully and saw all kinds of fitness equipment in the hall. There was a pool not far away.

Not only that, there was also a resting area and bathroom.

There was no one in the hall. Qiao Nian walked towards the resting area. From afar, she heard strange noises coming from within the room.

Just as Qiao Nian was feeling puzzled, she heard slapping sounds coming from inside.

“Sister Su, you’re really beautiful. I’m going to die because of you!” A man’s rough voice came from inside.

Su Xue’s sweet voice rang out as well. “Hurry up, then. I haven’t had enough!”

Qiao Nian froze on the spot, as if she had been struck by lightning. She had never expected Su Xue to be with a gigolo.

Qiao Nian felt a wave of nausea. She nearly threw up. “Didn’t you just call your daughter to ask her to return home? Won’t you be in a hurry to return home?” The gigolo asked.

“Daughter? She doesn’t deserve that title!” At the mention of this, Su Xue flew into a rage. She said furiously, “How could I have given birth to a wretch like that?”

“Sister Xue, don’t be angry. Your health might get worse, and my heart will ache for you if that happens! I’ll serve you well right now. Just lie back and enjoy the sensation!”

“Sure.” Su Xue’s voice seemed to gentle as she spoke. “Faster, faster!”

Qiao Nian stood outside. The expression in her eyes grew colder and colder, and her hands clenched rightly into fists.

Qiao Nian quietly stepped out of the room and closed the door again, as if she had never been there.

The moment she stepped out of the door, Qiao Nian bumped into the instructor who had welcomed her warmly.

“Miss Qiao, have you seen Madam Su?”

Qiao Nian looked around. There was no one else around. This meant that only this instructor was aware of what was happening here.

Qiao Nian’s expression changed slightly. She took out a cheque from her bag, took out a pen, and wrote a string of numbers on the cheque. Then, she handed it to the coach and said, “This is one million dollars. In the future, don’t tell anyone that I came here.”

The instructor glanced at the cheque and looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief. Turning to glance at Su Xue’s room number, he seemed to come to an understanding.

One million.

This was a huge sum.

He had never even seen so much money.

A trace of hesitation flashed in his eyes, and he shook his head. Smiling politely, he said, “Miss Qiao, don’t worry. I won’t take the cheque. I’ll take it that I didn’t see you here today.”
