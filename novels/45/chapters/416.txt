Chapter 417: Change of Perspective

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian lowered her head to eat. Sensing that Lu Zhu had been watching her, she looked up and realized that he was looking at her thoughtfully.

One had to know that the way Lu Zhu used to look at her was filled with disgust and alienation.

For a moment, Qiao Nian was at a loss. An awkward atmosphere filled the air.

“It’s about to start now. We’ll be opponents in a while. I won’t show any mercy!” Qiao Nian smiled, breaking the stalemate. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Instead of answering Qiao Nian directly, Lu Zhu asked, “Then do you believe what the Qiao couple said?”

Qiao Nian was slightly taken aback. It turned out that Lu Zhu was still thinking about what had happened just now. She shrugged slightly and said, “I’m only half convinced!”

Moreover, the Qiao family was not to be trusted.

“Then have you thought of looking for your loved ones?”

Hearing Lu Zhu’s words, Qiao Nian’s movements slowed down, and the smile on her face slowly disappeared.

Actually, she did not want to mention finding her relatives.

Although she yearned for kinship, she also knew the reality very well.

If her parents had been looking for her too, they might have been together long ago.

......

Qiao Nian pursed her lips and said, “I did.”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s answer, Lu Zhu felt a little suffocated.

He could hear the resignation in her voice.

It seemed she hadn’t found her family.

Lu Zhu frowned and asked, “Where’s Gu Zhou?”

Qiao Nian was stunned. She hadn’t expected Lu Zhu to be so concerned about her background. But on second thought, it made sense. Perhaps Lu Zhu was thinking about his dead sister again.

Instinctively, Qiao Nian spoke up for Gu Zhou. “I did, but it’s not that easy to find a relative. Besides…”

At this point, Qiao Nian’s eyes darkened.

Her relatives did not seem to have approached her.

Thinking about it another way.

She did not allow her relatives to think of looking for her at all.

It had always been her wishful thinking.

Lu Zhu looked at Qiao Nian with concern. “What’s wrong?”

Qiao Nian’s eyes darkened, hiding the disappointment in them. In the end, she smiled at Lu Zhu and said, “I’d better eat breakfast first. Didn’t you say just now that you wanted to introduce a bodyguard to me?”

Seeing that Qiao Nian didn’t want to talk about it, Lu Zhu didn’t ask further. “He’s already on his way!”

If he continued to ask, he might be rubbing salt into Qiao Nian’s wound.

Lu Zhu ate in silence. Qiao Nian’s upbringing made him feel a little depressed.

She had not had a good life since she was young. Even so, she had tried her best to live and shine in the dark.

At this moment, Lu Zhu’s impression of Qiao Nian changed.

From the looks of it, every time Qiao Nian looked at him like that, perhaps he simply felt that she looked familiar.

After breakfast, Lu Zhu’s phone rang.

“Okay, I’ll be right there!”

With that, Lu Zhu hung up and looked up at Qiao Nian. “Your bodyguard has arrived. We’re going to see him now! He’s waiting for us in the hall!”

Actually, Qiao Nian didn’t need any bodyguards. With someone following her, she might feel a little uncomfortable.

However, this was Gu Zhou’s kind intentions, so she couldn’t refuse.

Qiao Nian followed Lu Zhu back to the hall. At this moment, everyone in the hall was looking at them.

Some were envious, some were jealous, and some were up to no good.

Qiao Nian frowned slightly.

Actually, there was a reason why she was wearing a red dress today. She just wanted to see if she could be lucky.

However, she ignored the fact that it would attract the attention of others.

Although she did not like Qiao Yu, what he had said previously still made sense.

Lu Zhu looked around and finally found his target. He waved his hand in the distance.

Qiao Nian followed Lu Zhu’s gaze and saw a man walking towards them. Her eyes widened slightly.

She was instantly stunned.

Jesus!

How was this a bodyguard? He was clearly the young master of a family!
