1480 Taking Revenge for You

Chen Qing quickly supported Lina.

Although the secretary had betrayed his father, his father had already cut off his tongue as punishment and let the secretary live.

Wright was simply too vicious. He actually tortured the secretary to death.

Lina looked at Wright angrily and gritted her teeth. “You… you’re a lunatic!”

When Wright heard Lina’s words, not only was he not angry, but his expression was also very calm. He smiled and stared unblinkingly at Lina’s face. “Lina, even if I’m a lunatic, I’m still a lunatic who loves you. Everything I do is because I love you!”

As Wright spoke, he glanced at the truck before looking at Lina and continuing, “He hurt you. How can I allow the person who hurt you to exist? I can only avenge you.”

Not only did Wright’s words not make Lina relax, but they also made her feel despair. She couldn’t help but grab Chen Qing’s arm, as if she was holding onto a straw to clutch at. It was as if this was the only way she could feel that she was not being controlled.

Lina’s legs were extremely weak, and she was practically leaning against Chen Qing.

Wright glanced at Lina’s hand, which was holding Chen Qing’s arm. He frowned imperceptibly, his eyes cold.

Chen Qing.

Lina seemed to have other thoughts about Chen Qing. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Wright pursed his lips, his bloodthirsty eyes falling on Chen Qing’s face.

As long as Chen Qing fell into his hands, he would definitely cut off Chen Qing’s limbs, dig out his eyes, cut off his ears and tongue, and slowly peel off his skin.

When the time came, he had to let Lina admire Chen Qing’s path to death.

With this thought in mind, Wright felt much happier. His gaze fell on Lina’s face and he asked gently, “Lina, do you like this gift?”

Lina felt a chill run down her spine, and her scalp went numb. She looked at Wright in fear and unease.

Was this man a demon?

How could he have done such a terrifying thing?

Qiao Nian, who was standing at the side, noticed that Lina didn’t look well. She stepped forward and shielded Lina behind her, looking fearlessly at Wright.

Wright’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. He glanced at her coldly and took a step to the side. Only then did he look at Lina and say, “I really didn’t expect there to be a traitor by the president’s side. He knew about your trip to Bear Mountain and deliberately arranged for someone to assassinate you, including poisoning you. Such a vicious person isn’t worthy of living.”

Lina took a deep breath. She hesitated for a long time and was about to speak when she heard Wright speak again.

When Lina heard the word “gift”, her body trembled even more. She subconsciously resisted the wooden box sent over by the assistant, but before she could speak, the assistant had already opened it.

A bloody heart was placed in a wooden box. Lina only took a glance and screamed as she hugged Chen Qing tightly. She closed her eyes and did not dare to open them again.

Seeing this, Wright put on a gentle smile and asked very respectfully, “Doesn’t the Seventh Princess like this gift?”

Lina’s body trembled. The image of the secretary hanging appeared in her mind again. Her stomach churned, and she couldn’t help but grip Chen Qing’s arm tightly.

Wright’s frown deepened. Lina was his woman. How could she be so close to someone else?
