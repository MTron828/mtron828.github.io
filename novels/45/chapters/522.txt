Chapter 523: Found Her After More Than Ten Years

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

After saying this, his voice became weaker and weaker. His gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s lips, and his eyes became more and more reckless. The danger in his eyes did not diminish at all. “I’ll let it go this time. If you still forget me next time, I’ll bite you to death!”

Qiao Nian stared at him, stunned.

What did he mean by those words just now?

He had been looking for her for more than ten years?

Among the people he knew, only Qin Chuan’s name had the word Chuan in it!

The more Qiao Nian thought about it, the stranger she felt. She looked up at the man in front of her and said, “Gu Chuan… what do you mean by that? Tell me clearly. What do you mean by looking for me for more than ten years…”

Just as Qiao Nian was about to say something, she realized that he was becoming more and more fragile.

Weakly, he leaned over her shoulder. He was so heavy that her shoulder ached under his weight. She could hear his heavy breathing.

“Nian’er, don’t leave me in the future. Stay by my side like this and don’t go anywhere. Otherwise, if I go crazy again, I don’t know if you can bear the consequences…”

When he had finished, he closed his eyes and his breathing slowed.

Qiao Nian hurriedly supported him, worried that he would fall.

Her mind was in a mess. If it weren’t for the smell on his body and his face, she couldn’t help but suspect that the person she was carrying wasn’t Gu Zhou.

Qiao Nian pushed him away anxiously and shouted softly, “Don’t sleep. Wake up quickly. Make yourself clear!”

As soon as Qiao Nian finished speaking, she felt the pressure on her body lighten. She turned her head and saw the man’s eyes open.

The man’s eyes were extremely clear, reflecting the wall lights. They were sparkling.

“Gu…”

Chuan.

Before Qiao Nian could finish speaking, Gu Zhou pressed himself against her face and nuzzled her neck.

“Zhou Zhou is going to sleep with Nian Nian tonight!” Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian coquettishly, his voice filled with dominance.

Qiao Nian was stunned again.

Zhou Zhou?

Oh my God!

She was really tired this evening.

Right, why wasn’t Gu Zhou out yet?

Could someone come and save her this evening?

Suddenly, Zhou Zhou looked up in confusion. His eyes were as clear as water, and he blinked innocently. He looked at Qiao Nian obediently and asked carefully, “Nian Nian, do you not want to sleep with Zhou Zhou?”

Qiao Nian looked into Gu Zhou’s innocent eyes and swallowed silently. For a moment, she didn’t know what to say. Her mind was in a mess, and she couldn’t think straight…

Seeing that Qiao Nian didn’t say anything, he held her hand aggrievedly and gently poked her palm with his finger. Then, he drew a heart on Qiao Nian’s palm and muttered, “Nian Nian, Zhou Zhou is very sleepy now. Let’s sleep together!”

Sleep?

Alright, sleeping was better than being tormented by him.

“Then let’s sleep!” Qiao Nian said eagerly.

“Okay.”

Seeing how wet Gu Zhou was, Qiao Nian frowned and said, “You’ll catch a cold if you sleep like this. Zhou Zhou, go take a shower first.”

His beautiful eyes instantly curved into crescents as he asked expectantly, “Is Nian Nian going to take a shower with Zhou Zhou?”

Without thinking, Qiao Nian subconsciously shook her head and said, “No!”

Disappointment instantly appeared in his eyes. He frowned and asked in confusion, “Why not?”

Qiao Nian raised a hand to her forehead and sighed helplessly. She desperately hoped that Gu Zhou would come out soon. Zhou Zhou was like a child.

It would have been fine if Zhou Zhou was really a child, but he was an adult, and an adult older than her.

“Nian Nian.”
