Chapter 598: Lawyer

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Seeing Gu Zhou glare daggers at him, Chen Qing hurriedly said, “There’s a young and beautiful woman following Young Master Lu.”

Gu Zhou frowned, his eyes serious. He didn’t seem to be joking at all. “If I remember correctly, his company’s lawyer is a young woman.”

A lawyer?

Chen Qing was still wondering how his Second Young Master knew that the young and beautiful woman was a lawyer. Could it be that Second Young Master was a clairvoyant?

This was impossible!

Chen Qing hurriedly threw the messy thoughts to the back of his mind. He couldn’t help but ask, “Second Young Master, how did you know that woman was a lawyer?”

“Divorce!” Gu Zhou looked at Chen Qing with disdain, as if he was looking at an extremely stupid person.

Chen Qing was instantly flustered.

Divorce?

Could it be that Second Young Madam had met with Eldest Young Master Lu to discuss Second Young Master and Second Young Madam’s divorce?

“But when Second Young Madam went to see Young Master Lu, she was still concerned about Little Master.” Chen Qing was a little confused.

Gu Zhou looked down at the approaching snake and nodded. He said calmly, “You’re not as smart as a snake.”

Chen Qing was speechless.

“Get out!” Gu Zhou said indifferently.

Chen Qing was a little puzzled. Although he didn’t understand why Second Young Master wanted him to leave so quickly, he still agreed without hesitation. He turned around and walked out.

As long as he didn’t have to stack tiles or be fed to the snakes, he could do anything.

After Chen Qing left, Gu Zhou was left alone in the room. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Gu Zhou looked at the contents of the computer screen, deep in thought.

Yongan Building.

The more Qiao Nian listened to Gu Qing talk about the condition of patients with autism, the more frightened she became. She thought about how Gu Qi’s autism had been caused by his environment. Under such circumstances, as long as Gu Qi received treatment, he would recover quickly.

Although she was a doctor, she didn’t know much about psychology.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Qing sincerely and asked, “Doctor Gu, can you come home with me and help confirm the child’s condition?”

When Gu Qing heard Qiao Nian’s words, she shook her head and refused without hesitation. She said, “Miss Qiao, I’ve already told you before that he’s not sick. He just craves attention. If I go now, I might trigger his rebelliousness. If you really care about him, spend more time with him!”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Qing’s words, her eyes were filled with helplessness and disappointment. Gu Qi had lost the care of his parents the moment he was born. She had no way of directly confirming Gu Qi’s condition.

Sigh.

Gu Qing looked at Qiao Nian’s helpless expression and hesitated.

She was a psychiatrist. She had seen too many people come to her as mothers for the sake of their children. Those people had the same expression as Qiao Nian.

Hence, Gu Qing was completely certain that Qiao Nian was a mother. However, this child might really be what she had said, and not her biological child.

Qiao Nian’s current reaction was probably because she had said that she would treat that child as a substitute for her own child.

What about her children?

This thought flashed through Gu Qing’s mind, but she quickly calmed down.

It was not impossible to visit that child.

Gu Qing glanced at the watch on her wrist and frowned slightly. After some consideration, she relaxed, her eyes filled with gentleness. “I’m sorry, I’m going to the airport soon. I don’t have time to go with you. Why don’t I get my junior sister to go with you to take a look? Do you think that’s okay?”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Qing’s words, her eyes lit up. She nodded vigorously and said, “That’s great. Thank you.”

Qiao Nian had heard of Gu Qing’s Junior Sister before. She was also one of the founders of the clinic. Although her reputation wasn’t as great as Gu Qing’s, she was very professional and respected.

“Alright, that’s settled then. I’ll leave first. We’ll contact each other after my junior sister has taken a look, okay?” Gu Qing said with a gentle smile.

“Thank you.” Qiao Nian smiled and nodded.

She stood up and walked Gu Qing to the door. After Gu Qing left, she fell into deep thought and frowned slightly.

She didn’t know if Gu Qing’s judgment was right. She only hoped that Gu Qi really didn’t have autism. If that was the case, she would spend more time taking care of Gu Qi.
