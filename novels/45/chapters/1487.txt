1488 Comforting Her

She didn’t want to implicate Qiao Nian either. If she died, her father, who didn’t know the truth, would definitely suspect that Qiao Nian had killed her.

However, Qiao Nian insisted on making an antidote for her. It was precisely because of Qiao Nian’s persistence that Wright’s evil plan didn’t succeed.

Lina looked at Qiao Nian as if she was her savior. She held Qiao Nian’s hand tightly with both hands, her eyes filled with tears. She bit her lip and said tearfully, “Nian Nian, only you can save my mother now!”

Qiao Nian smiled and began, “Don’t worry, I’ll definitely do my best to save your mother!”

“Thank you, thank you so much!” Lina looked at Qiao Nian with red-rimmed eyes, her voice trembling.

Gu Zhou frowned imperceptibly. From the corner of his eye, he glanced at Chen Qing.

Chen Qing immediately understood. He walked to Lina’s side and supported her, comforting her softly. “Seventh Princess, don’t worry. Even if our Madam can’t treat your mother immediately, she should be able to stabilize her condition!”

When Lina heard Chen Qing’s voice, the tip of her nose was filled with Chen Qing’s unique freshness.

For some reason, his voice and the smell of him made her feel at ease.

Lina gently let go of Qiao Nian’s hand.

Qiao Nian smiled at Lina and comforted her. “I’ll go in and take a look now.”

Lina came back to her senses, and her ears turned red uncontrollably. She hurriedly replied, “Okay.”

Everyone walked in.

The servants walked in and out, their faces filled with anxiety.

When Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou reached the door, they heard a woman scream.

That voice was so high-pitched that it made one uncomfortable. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

She could vaguely hear the President’s gentle comforting words, but none of them seemed to have any effect. The woman continued to scream loudly, as if she was completely immersed in her own world.

Qiao Nian wanted to enter, but was stopped by Dr. Ollie, who had come out. “Go in later. It’s not appropriate now.”

Qiao Nian nodded and didn’t insist.

Dr. Ollie looked at Qiao Nian and said, “I heard from the president that you’re here to treat Madam today. I’ll tell you about the medicine Madam has taken recently.”

“Okay.”

Wright was on the bed preparing to go back to sleep when there was another knock on the door.

Wright sat up impatiently. Just as he was about to fly into a rage, the voice of the first earl’s biological daughter, Annie, came from outside the door.

“Brother?”

The door opened.

With a gentle smile on his face, Wright looked at Annie and asked, “Annie, what’s wrong?”

Annie was wearing a white sweater over a black wool coat, and jeans. Her hair was tied up high, and she had a bright smile on her face. “I heard from the servants that Father seems to be angry with brother again?”

“These servants in the house are too bold. They gossip behind people’s backs all day long. They don’t do much of their own jobs.” Wright pursed his lips slightly and said disdainfully.

“Brother, are you saying that the servants are spouting nonsense?” Annie raised her eyebrows slightly and crossed her arms, staring unblinkingly at Wright.

“Are you preparing to go out in this outfit?” Wright’s gaze fell on Annie’s face. Annie usually stayed at home, but this woman was a disaster whenever she went out.

The smile on Annie’s face grew brighter. She said smugly, “Brother, you should know me. I usually like to lie at home and play games. If my father didn’t ask me to go out on an errand, I wouldn’t be willing to go out.”

Wright’s heart skipped a beat. Annie had deliberately come to him to show off. Trying hard to remain calm, he said, “I know what my sister can do. Most people aren’t your match.”

“What ability do I have? I only know how to play games. Brother, did you not rest well last night? Then rest well. I’ll do the rest.” Without waiting for Wright to speak, Annie waved at him and walked out.
