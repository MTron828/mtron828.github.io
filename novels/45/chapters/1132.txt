1133 Take Good Care of Her

Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian followed Qin Chuan’s gaze and saw that Gu Zhou’s forehead was covered in cold sweat. She retracted her gaze and smiled at Qin Chuan. “Then help me send my sister home. Take good care of her.”

Lu Qi looked at the wound on Qin Chuan’s face and said worriedly, “But the wound on your face…”

“It’s fine,” Qin Chuan said nonchalantly.

Lu Qi could only nod in agreement.

!!

Qin Chuan walked out first, followed closely by Lu Qi. Seeing that they had all left, Qiao Nian began to take Gu Zhou’s pulse.

Jiang Chi’s men had already left. Qin Chuan glanced at his mercenaries, signaling for them to disperse. He led Lu Qi to his car.

Like a gentleman, Qin Chuan opened the door of the front passenger seat and invited Lu Qi in. After Lu Qi got into the car, he closed the door and walked towards the trunk.

There was often a medicine box in the trunk of Qin Chuan’s car. He took the medicine box and got into the car, preparing to clean up the injuries on his face.

Seeing Qin Chuan’s actions, Lu Qi frowned. She was a medical student. Seeing Qin Chuan wash his wound incorrectly, she couldn’t take it anymore.

“Um, do you want me to do it?” As Lu Qi spoke, she reached out for the disinfectant cotton bat without waiting for Qin Chuan to refuse.

Qin Chuan saw Lu Qi’s small hand appear in front of him. His hand was not big. Just as he was about to restrain himself, he sensed that Lu Qi was holding his right hand, which was wiping his wound.

Her hands were a little cold. He could see her fair and delicate hands in the rearview mirror. Her nails were round and smooth, like top-grade unpolished jade.

He swallowed and Lu Qi took his hand away.

Lu Qi didn’t seem to notice her rudeness at all. All her attention was on Qin Chuan’s injuries.

Qin Chuan looked at Lu Qi’s small face in the rearview mirror without restraint. Her fair face was filled with seriousness, and her slender fingers were holding a disinfectant swab to wipe the wound on his face.

Qin Chuan looked at her with joy in his eyes, and his lips curved up involuntarily.

Lu Qi was slightly stunned. She looked at Qin Chuan in confusion. “Why are you smiling?”

Qin Chuan hurriedly put on a roguish smile and pretended not to care. “Actually, you don’t have to be so gentle. I’m not afraid of pain!”

Lu Qi naturally didn’t notice how gentle Qin Chuan’s gaze was when he looked at her in the mirror. She nodded and lowered her head to continue cleaning Qin Chuan’s wound.

After Lu Qi treated Qin Chuan’s wound, for some reason, she recalled the situation when Qin Chuan and Jiang Chi were confronting each other. She immediately shrank back and said dryly, “Um, it’s done.”

“Doctor Lu’s medical skills are not bad,” Qin Chuan said with a smile.

When Lu Qi heard the words “Doctor Lu”, she subconsciously looked up at Qin Chuan and met his burning gaze.

She could clearly see that his slightly seductive peach blossom eyes were especially bright, as if they were filled with stars. Her face was clearly reflected in them.

Lu Qi was slightly stunned, and her heart skipped a beat.

She had heard from others in the past that when a man looked at the woman he loved, his eyes were filled with stars. Moreover, his eyes were filled with the person he loved.

Lu Qi immediately looked away. She was at a loss. She knew in her heart that Qin Chuan was taking care of her for her sister’s sake. She shouldn’t have such strange thoughts.

“I-I should go back…”

“Have you reached eighteen?” Qin Chuan asked without waiting for Lu Qi to finish.

Lu Qi looked at Qin Chuan in confusion and retracted her gaze. Her gaze fell on the passersby on the street and she nodded. “I’m already nineteen.”

Qin Chuan looked at Lu Qi with burning eyes. In a daze, he seemed to have thought of something. His lips curved up slightly as he said, “You’re already an adult.”

Lu Qi nodded in agreement. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“I still remember when I saw you previously. You seemed to be still a high school student.” When Qin Chuan said this, his eyes were filled with laughter.

When Lu Qi heard Qin Chuan’s words, she turned to look at him and saw him smiling until his eyes curved into crescents. Puzzled, she asked, “Mr. Qin, have we met before?”

Why didn’t she remember seeing Mr. Qin?
