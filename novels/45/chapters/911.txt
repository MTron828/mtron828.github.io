912 Talking to Her Alone

Qiao Nian looked around but didn’t see anyone else. A trace of confusion flashed in her eyes, but she quickly focused on Xiao Shi.

Xiao Shi stood in front of the tombstone. When she saw Song Man’s photo, there was suddenly no trace of sadness in her heart.

In the photo, Song Man had a bright smile on her face. Everything around her paled in comparison.

Song Man was rarely happy. Xiao Shi still remembered that on Song Man’s birthday, she had secretly prepared a cake for her. Song Man had smiled happily.

At that time, Xiao Shi realized that Song Man looked very good when she smiled.

She had always thought that Song Man was unhappy because she only had one arm.

Xiao Shi recalled everything she had done with Song Man. She had never expected Song Man to be a bad person.

“Can I speak to her alone?” As Xiao Shi spoke, she looked up at Qiao Nian and asked seriously.

Qiao Nian nodded, then let go of Xiao Shi’s hand and walked away with Gu Qi.

There was a public chair not far away. She sat on it with Gu Qi, so she could see Xiao Shi.

Xiao Shi stood in front of the tombstone, staring unblinkingly at Song Man’s photo. She avoided the flowers in front of the tombstone and walked to it.

Her young hand gently wiped Song Man’s photo, and her eyes turned slightly red.

Although she knew that Song Man had ill intentions, she had spent five years with her every day and night. It was impossible to say that she had no feelings for her.

“Mommy…” Xiao Shi called out softly, her voice choked.

In a daze, she seemed to see Song Man sitting at the side and smiling at her.

“Mommy…” Xiao Shi walked towards Song Man. Just as she was about to hug the tombstone, she seemed to have thought of something and retracted her hand. “I can’t call you Mommy anymore!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Yes, Qiao Nian will be a good mommy. She’ll take good care of you!” Song Man said softly. She reached out to touch Xiao Shi’s face, but just as her hand was about to touch it, she retracted it. “You don’t have to miss me!”

Xiao Shi looked at Song Man, her eyes red. She sniffled.

“Xiao Shi, eat well, sleep well, and grow up well. Don’t come again!” With that, Song Man walked towards the tombstone and instantly disappeared.

Xiao Shi came back to her senses. She didn’t know if she had imagined everything that had just happened, or if she had really seen Song Man’s soul.

“Mommy!” Xiao Shi looked at the tombstone, her tears falling uncontrollably.

Everything about her interactions with Song Man flashed in her mind.

Song Man fed her awkwardly with one hand.

Song Man helped her put on her clothes with difficulty.

She carried water to help Song Man wash her face.

…

Song Man always had a sorrowful expression on her face. Occasionally, she would even smile.

To Song Man, the past five years might have been a fifth of her life, but to Xiao Shi, it was everything.

“In the future, Qiao Nian will be my mommy from now on. I know you care about me, but you just don’t know how to express it.” Tears welled up in her eyes as she blinked, trying hard not to cry. She continued, “I’ll live a good life in the future and be happy with Daddy and Mommy. I hope you…”

At this point, her eyes gradually dimmed.

The photo of Song Man on the tombstone was so bright. It was impossible to tell that she was a bad person.

Her small hand caressed Song Man’s photo and she said, “In the future, be a good person and live a happy life. Don’t live so tiredly.”

After Xiao Shi composed herself, she said goodbye and left without looking back.

She walked towards Qiao Nian and Gu Qi. Her lips curved up slightly, revealing a happy smile.

From now on, she would be the daughter of Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian.

She had Daddy and Mommy’s love.

She had her brother’s love.

And Grandma’s love.

In the future, more people would like and dote on her.

Of course, there were more people she cared about.

Seeing that Xiao Shi had arrived, Qiao Nian and Gu Qi hurriedly stood up.

Qiao Nian glanced at Xiao Shi’s face. Worried that Xiao Shi would be sad, she was about to comfort her when Xiao Shi ran up to her and hugged her waist.
