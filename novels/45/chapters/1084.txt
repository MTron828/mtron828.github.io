1085 You have to believe Mommy.

“There’s no mistake. The person we’re arresting is Qiao Xin. Please don’t disturb us while we’re on official business!” the police officer said expressionlessly.

“Then can I have a word with my daughter? I just want—”

Before Su Xue could finish speaking, Qiao Xin interrupted coldly, “I don’t think there’s anything to talk about between us!”

When Su Xue heard Qiao Xin’s words, it was as if she had been struck by lightning. She stood rooted to the ground in a daze, looking at Qiao Xin in disbelief. Her voice trembled. “You… you really know everything?” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Qiao Xin stopped in her tracks, as did the two police officers. They let the mother and daughter talk!

“If you don’t want others to know, don’t do it!” Qiao Xin said through gritted teeth.

Su Xue felt as if her heart had been dug out of her chest. It was so painful that she was about to suffocate. She stammered as she explained, “Back then, I wanted you to be released. I didn’t expect you to bump into Lu Zhu. You have to believe Mom!”

“You never thought of giving me to Lu Zhu? How did he catch me then?” Qiao Xin asked with a cold smile.

“Back then, I deliberately dropped you off halfway so that Lu Zhu wouldn’t find you. I even wanted to drive away to lure them away, but I didn’t expect him to find you in the end!” Towards the end, Su Xue cried until she was out of breath. With a look of despair, she said, “You’re my daughter. You protected me so well. How could I harm you?”

Qiao Xin gave a cold smile and asked, “You’re finally confessing, aren’t you? If you hadn’t picked me up from the hospital, how could I have met Lu Zhu? In other words, you planned to hand me over to him from the beginning. Later on, you felt guilty and prepared to let me go. Is that right?”

When Su Xue heard Qiao Xin’s words, she opened her mouth slightly, but no words came out.

Qiao Xin was right!

This was her fault!

In the beginning, she had indeed planned to listen to Qiao Shan and hand Qiao Xin over to Lu Zhu to protect her son.

At this moment, a servant pushed Qiao Shan in a wheelchair in.

Qiao Shan had been staying in the hospital, but someone had called and asked him to go home. They said that if he didn’t go back, they would attack Qiao Yu, so Qiao Shan had no choice but to come back.

He looked at the police officer holding Qiao Xin, and his pupils dilated involuntarily. He asked in shock, “Why are you taking my child away?”

When Qiao Xin heard Qiao Shan’s words, she was stunned.

Her gaze moved away from Qiao Shan’s face and landed on his leg. She had personally broken his leg.

Qiao Xin’s eyes grew redder and redder. If she hadn’t angered Gu Zhou, how could Gu Zhou have forced her to break her father’s legs?

The only person she had let down in this family was her father!

Qiao Xin’s legs gave way and she almost fell to the ground. Seeing this, the police officer immediately picked Qiao Xin up.

A stream of tears fell to the ground one by one. Qiao Xin looked at Qiao Shan with teary eyes. She raised her hand to wipe her tears away before she could see Qiao Shan’s face clearly.

Perhaps it was because her father’s leg was injured, but he looked much more haggard.

Qiao Xin still remembered how high-spirited Qiao Shan had been in the past, but her father had now become disabled!

Qiao Xin really regretted it!

She shouldn’t have let her father suffer on her behalf back then!

She had hurt the person who doted on her the most in the world!

Qiao Xin looked at Qiao Shan’s face and said in a choked voice, “Dad, I’m really sorry. I’ve harmed you. I should have broken my leg back then. Only now do I know that you’re the only one in the family who treats me the best!”

Fortunately, her father treated her well. Otherwise, she would have felt that there was no hope of survival.

Qiao Shan felt a little guilty when he heard Qiao Xin’s words, but he couldn’t tell the truth now. What had happened to Qiao Xin at the Earth Temple was like a thorn in his heart.

Qiao Shan said guiltily, “Don’t say that. Dad didn’t protect you well. You’re my daughter. I should have done my best to protect you!”

Su Xue, who was standing at the side, widened her eyes when she heard Qiao Shan’s words. She almost couldn’t breathe.

“How can you be so hypocritical?” Su Xue questioned loudly, glaring at Qiao Shan angrily.
