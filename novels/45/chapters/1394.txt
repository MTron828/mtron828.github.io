1395 Unexpected Meeting

Qiao Nian looked at Qin Chuan, who seemed to have encountered a century-old problem. She lowered her head, conflicted.

She had grown up with Qin Chuan since she was young. She knew every expression of his very well. Qin Chuan was in a dilemma over whether to visit Qi Qi.

Previously, she had thought that Qin Chuan had taken a liking to Qi Qi’s talent in medicine and wanted to help his grandfather take her in as his disciple. But now, it seemed that things were not that simple.

She narrowed her eyes. She knew very well that if Qin Chuan didn’t visit Qi Qi tonight, he probably wouldn’t sleep tonight!

She even suspected now that he was not helping her grandfather take in a disciple at all, but that he wanted to find a wife.

Qiao Nian slowly lowered her gaze. She had no way to ask Qin Chuan why he had helped her grandfather take Qi Qi in as his disciple. Now that Qin Chuan had lost his memory, he naturally didn’t have his previous memories.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips slightly and said, “Why don’t you sit in a wheelchair? I’ll bring you to the door of her ward. Take a look at her through the glass!”

“Okay.” When Qin Chuan heard Qiao Nian’s suggestion, his frown relaxed. This was really a good idea. Not only would he not wake Qi Qi up, but he would also be able to see her.

Song Yu smiled and said, “Then I’ll go to the duty room to borrow a wheelchair.”

“Thank you for your trouble,” Qiao Nian said.

In less than five minutes, Song Yu returned with a wheelchair.

Qiao Nian helped Qin Chuan out of the bed. Seeing how strenuous it was, Song Yu was about to step forward to help when she saw Qin Chuan’s polite and distant smile.

Song Yu smiled and retracted her hand. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Qin Chuan sat in the wheelchair with difficulty. It wasn’t that he didn’t like Song Yu, but he didn’t like other members of the opposite sex touching him.

As for Qiao Nian, he felt that it was very natural to interact with her. He didn’t feel any repulsion at all.

Qiao Nian pushed Qin Chuan’s wheelchair out, and Song Yu followed.

The three of them had just walked to Lu Qi’s ward when the door opened.

Lu Qi, who was wearing a hospital gown, was pushing the moving IV stand out.

When Qin Chuan saw Lu Qi, his eyes were filled with surprise. However, when he realized that her face was pale, there was a hint of worry in his eyes.

When Lu Qi saw Qin Chuan, she immediately squatted down in front of him and grabbed his left hand. Her beautiful eyes were like fireworks. “Senior Brother, how do you feel now? Does it still hurt?”

Senior Brother?

In a daze, Qin Chuan seemed to hear a sweet voice calling him “Senior Brother” by his ear. His lips curved up slightly. Tears were falling from Lu Qi’s red-rimmed eyes again.

Just seeing her cry made Qin Chuan feel terrible. He raised his right hand and carefully wiped Lu Qi’s tears away. He said gently, “I’m fine now. Don’t worry.”

Seeing Qin Chuan like this, Lu Qi was still worried about his health, but she was more glad that her senior brother was fine.

Her life had been saved by Senior Brother.

Lu Qi stood up and moved closer to Qin Chuan. She hugged him gratefully, her voice choked with emotion. “Senior, thank you. Thank you for saving me!”

She rested her head gently on his shoulder, afraid that she would touch his wound. She didn’t dare to use any strength.

Qin Chuan’s entire body stiffened. Her body was so soft, and she smelled of milk and disinfectant.

In a daze, he felt that he had once been very greedy for the milky fragrance on her body. He seemed to have smelled this scent a long time ago.

He was certain that the two of them were destined to be together.

He had never been a hesitant person. If he felt that they were a match made in heaven, he would have married her long ago!

Qin Chuan now understood that he must have loved the girl in front of him very much. He must have married her long ago.

After Qin Chuan thought through what had happened, he raised his hand and hugged Lu Qi back. He gently patted Lu Qi’s back and said gently, “Husband and wife don’t have to thank each other.”

Qin Chuan’s words were like a bomb, completely stunning Lu Qi, Qiao Nian, and Song Yu.

Lu Qi let go of Qin Chuan hesitantly and stared unblinkingly at him.
