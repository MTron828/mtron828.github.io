Chapter 1791 - 1791 The Advantage

At this moment, the president was already fighting with Mark. He still wanted to continue fighting with Mark, but Qiao Nian stopped him.

The President looked at Qiao Nian beside him and saw that her eyes were calm.

“Mr. President, leave this to us.”

The president panted heavily and gradually returned to reality. If he was still the prince back then, he could indeed compete with Mark. But now, he was not only the president, but also the president of the guards around him and the entire European country.

If Mark became the president, the entire European country would probably become hell on earth.

“I understand.” The President nodded slightly and put away his long knife. Under the protection of the other guards, he retreated to the side.

Qiao Nian bent down and pulled out the long knife from the waist of a person on the ground. Hence, she joined Gu Zhou’s camp to fight against Mark.

She and Gu Zhou had a tacit understanding. They faced Mark from both sides. Their moves were completely different, but they could restrain Mark, forcing him to defend himself in a panic. He didn’t even get a chance to attack.

Mark looked at the president, who was getting further and further away from him, and anger surged in his heart. He tightened his grip on the long knife in his hand and said angrily, “It’s you again. Why are you so annoying? You’ve ruined so many of my good things. Since you want to go to hell, don’t blame me for being rude!”

Now, Mark was very impatient with Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou. He only cared about the throne.

Mark gripped the long knife in his hand tightly and slashed at Qiao Nian fiercely.

Seeing this, Gu Zhou wanted to help, but he noticed Qiao Nian’s gaze.

Qiao Nian gestured for him not to move around, so Gu Zhou could only maintain his original formation.

Qiao Nian tilted her body and dodged Mark’s attack.

Mark felt as if he had punched cotton. He felt deeply powerless.

At this moment, outside the castle gate.

Everyone, who had been drinking and watching the fireworks, was chatting. As the fireworks gradually dissipated, the sound of weapons clashing and roars came from the castle.

Everyone sitting at the banquet table was stunned. They looked at each other in surprise, not understanding what had happened.

They were not fools. They had asked their guards to go over and take a look, but they had not expected the gates of the castle to be tightly blocked. Mark’s guards were guarding the gates with guns. They did not intend to let anyone in or let anyone out.

The media took out their cameras one by one and aimed them at the door of the castle, recording all the noises in the castle.

The royal family members sitting in the front row looked at each other and could not help but mutter softly.

“Why would Mark do this? It’s obvious that he won’t let anyone in.”

“The wedding should be held in front of us. What does he want to do by holding the wedding behind closed doors?”

“There seems to be a fight inside.”

“I want to go in and take a look.”

“Don’t go in. You don’t have a gun in your hand, and the people you brought are unarmed. The guards at the door are all armed.”

…

Gu Ting, who was sitting not far away, saw many people gathered in front of the castle gate. In the end, Mark’s guards impatiently raised their pistols, as if they would kill anyone who dared to barge in.

Gu Ting slowly took in a breath of air. It seemed that Mark’s current situation was not ideal, so the guards guarding outside the door were all filled with resentment and were unwilling to pay attention to the royal family.

Gu Ting heaved a sigh of relief. It seemed that his two sons had already gained the upper hand.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The royal family was unarmed now, but they would definitely call someone over. Then they could just barge in. When that happened, it would all be over.

At this moment, in the hall of the castle.

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian were fighting Mark to the death.

The guards beside the president also gradually collapsed. He was in a very dangerous situation.

His guards gradually ran out of stamina, so he fought those people with his long saber and gradually forced the enemy to retreat.
At this moment, Cui Huai rushed to the president’s side under the protection of Chen Sheng and the others. His eyes were filled with hatred.
