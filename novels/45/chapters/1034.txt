1035 Going to Hell

Qiao Nian looked at Lu Jiang in surprise and smiled. “Fourth Brother, why are you here?”

Lu Jiang stopped in front of them with a faint smile on his face.

Previously, in order to deal with He Cheng, he had asked his men to look for He Cheng everywhere. After investigating, they finally found Maple Forest Villa.

He had originally planned to enter the villa to investigate them one by one, but then he saw his eldest brother bringing his sister and Gu Zhou over.

!!

Lu Jiang instantly understood. His brother must have captured He Cheng, which was why he hadn’t found him.

“Are you here to deal with He Cheng?” Lu Jiang raised his eyebrows slightly.

Lu Zhu instantly understood Lu Jiang’s thoughts and said, “Since you’re here too, come in with me.”

The four of them walked into the tunnel. Lu Jiang slowly rolled up his sleeves and said, “I like to deal with people the most. I can’t miss out on such a thing.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Everyone walked down one floor and saw an elevator door. One had to swipe their access card to use the elevator. After entering the elevator, Lu Zhu pressed “-6” and said, “I wanted to put some wine here, but I didn’t expect those two to use it first.”

After arriving at basement six, Lu Zhu pointed to the room on the left and said, “Qiao Xin is here.”

He looked to his right again and said, “He Cheng is over here.”

Qiao Xin’s face appeared in Qiao Nian’s mind. She turned back to look at the other three and said, “Brother, I’ve already thought of how to deal with her.”

Lu Zhu was as calm as ever, but his eyes were a little cold.

His sister was a priceless treasure. In his heart, she was more important than his life, but Qiao Xin had set her up.

As a woman, Qiao Xin had actually asked He Cheng to drug her sister. She had even asked many people to taint her sister. She had even wanted to take an indecent video of her sister.

His sister could not be wronged at all.

Suppressing his anger, Lu Zhu said, “Why don’t we give her a taste of her own medicine?”

“Yes, let her know what it means to suffer the consequences of her own actions.” Qiao Nian pursed her lips slightly, her eyes filled with smiles.

Six years ago, Qiao Xin had ruined her reputation. Now, she was going to ruin Qiao Xin’s reputation.

Lu Zhu opened Qiao Xin’s door and Qiao Nian walked in.

The windows of the room were decorated with skylights. Those who didn’t know better would think that it was a real scenery.

When Qiao Nian walked in, she realized that the room was very cold. No wonder Qiao Xin was curled up when she was watching the video.

Qiao Xin’s lips were trembling from the cold. When she heard the door open, she looked up and saw Qiao Nian walking in. Her expression changed slightly.

Soon, Qiao Xin hid the panic in her eyes. She quickly got out of bed and limped over to Qiao Nian. She held Qiao Nian’s hand intimately, her eyes filled with stars. “Sister, Sister, did you specially come to save me?”

Qiao Nian didn’t miss the look in Qiao Xin’s eyes when she first saw her. At that time, Qiao Xin’s eyes were filled with hatred.

She had to admit that Qiao Xin was getting better at acting. Now, she was starting to act pitiful.

She shook off Qiao Xin’s hand coldly, her lips curving up slightly. Under Qiao Xin’s puzzled gaze, she enunciated each word clearly. “Of course I’m here to send you to hell!”

When Qiao Xin heard Qiao Nian’s words, her expression changed slightly, and her eyes were filled with panic. She grabbed Qiao Nian’s hand desperately and said anxiously, “Sister, I know you’re angry. Don’t be angry anymore. Let’s hurry up and get out!”

“You sent He Cheng over, didn’t you?” Qiao Nian looked at Qiao Xin expressionlessly.

Qiao Xin’s heart sank to the bottom. Despair welled up in her heart, and she said in a panic, “Sister, don’t listen to He Cheng’s nonsense. He’s a liar. I don’t even know him. I…”

“If you don’t know him, how do you know that he’s a liar?”

Qiao Xin was speechless.

Qiao Xin held Qiao Nian’s hand tightly and said in a trembling voice, “Sister, I know you’re the kindest and best sister in the world. You definitely won’t bully me, right?”

Qiao Nian’s lips curved into a mocking smile.

Kind?

Did she deserve to be bullied because she was kind?

What about Qiao Xin?

When had Qiao Xin ever been kind to her?

Now that Qiao Xin looked so afraid, how could Qiao Xin not know that she was afraid six years ago?
