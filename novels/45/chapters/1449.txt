1450 Arrest me?

However, before Qiao Nian and the others could leave, Wright’s men had already surrounded them.

Wright walked up to Qiao Nian and the others anxiously. He looked worriedly at Lina, who was in Chen Qing’s arms, and asked gently, “Lina, how are you now? You…”

Lina opened her eyes slightly, her brow furrowed on her pale face. A trace of disgust flashed in her eyes. She tried hard to regulate her breathing to remain calm. She asked weakly, “Wright? Why are you here?”

Wright was so anxious that his eyes were red. The worry on his face was not fake at all. He hurriedly said, “The president knew that you had come to Bear Mountain and was worried that you would be hurt, so he asked me to come and protect you. How did you become like this?”

With that, without waiting for Lina to speak, Wright glanced at Qiao Nian, Chen Qing, and the others. With a sharp gaze, he said, “Guards, arrest these two Country Z people. How dare they hurt the princess!”

Lina wanted to explain for Qiao Nian, but the pain in her shoulder suffocated her.

“Arrest me?” Qiao Nian raised her eyebrows slightly and questioned coldly, “Is this how you treat your guests in Europe? Without asking for an explanation, you directly sentenced someone to death?”

“Am I wrong?” Wright frowned slightly and said angrily, “If it weren’t for you, how could Lina have been hurt? You’re now a suspect for hurting the princess. It’s only right for me to arrest you.”

“No,” Lina shouted. She couldn’t help but cough twice and continue, “Nian Nian saved my life. She’s my best friend, Wright. You can’t be impudent!”

Lina was not in good health to begin with. Now that she had said so much, she was already panting. She leaned against Chen Qing’s chest tiredly.

When Wright heard Lina’s words, his eyes narrowed slightly. He glanced at Qiao Nian with a complicated expression, his gaze finally landing on Lina’s face. “Lina, you said that they were your friends, but you were injured when you were with them. They were clearly the ones who hurt you.”

Seeing this, David hurriedly took a step forward and explained, “Prince Wright, you’ve misunderstood. Madam Gu and her bodyguards have been protecting the princess. They’re friends of our princess…”

“Shut up.” Wright looked at David angrily, his brow furrowed. The disdain in his eyes was obvious. “You’re just a servant. You have no right to speak here!”

David was so rendered speechless by Wright. He stood there with his head lowered.

Lina frowned and looked at Wright, who was not far away. Gritting her teeth, she said, “My business has nothing to do with you. Move aside. We want to go down the mountain.”

As Lina spoke, she tugged at the wound. Blood seeped out of her shoulder again.

Wright retracted his gaze from David’s face and looked at Lina in front of him. His lips curved up slightly as he said gently, “Lina, I’m your brother and the person you love the most. I know you treat them as your friends, but now that you’re injured, you don’t know what’s going on at all. I won’t kill them. I’ll just lock them up.”

After a pause, Wright continued, “Don’t be willful now. Come down the mountain with me. I’ve already asked a private doctor to be stationed outside the park.”

All the strength in Lina’s body was about to be drained. Even though her body was weak, her mind was racing.

Wright had said that the private doctor was almost outside the park. How did Wright know that she had been injured on the mountain?

“No!” Lina refused without hesitation.

Seeing that the blood on Lina’s shoulder had already stained the bandaged white cloth, Wright’s expression changed. He glared fiercely at Qiao Nian, who was standing at the side. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Lina had been weak since she was young, and she was very afraid of pain. She was unwilling to accept his help now because this woman from Country Z was sowing discord behind her back.

What Wright couldn’t stand the most was that the woman from Country Z was so bold as to pull out the arrow from Lina’s body. She wanted Lina to die.

Wright’s eyes darkened, but his tone was still gentle. “Lina, stop fooling around!”
