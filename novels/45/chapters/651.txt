Chapter 652: Dealing with the Qiao Family

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“The Qiao family is very likely to get that piece of land.”

Lu Zhu frowned, his body exuding a cold aura. He asked, “Because of Qiao Yu?”

The secretary nodded. He knew in his heart that Qiao Yu was in trouble.

“Why?” Lu Zhu raised his eyebrows slightly.

“The people from the Land Bureau value Qiao Yu very much. Moreover, that piece of land has already been decided for Qiao Yu, but it seems that a mysterious organization has appeared. The Land Bureau has hesitated. It’s precisely because of this that we have a chance to win the bid.”

Lu Zhu’s hand tapped lightly on the table. Puzzled, he asked, “You didn’t find out which family it is?”

“Indeed, we haven’t found anything, but there should be news soon.”

“Then investigate thoroughly,” Lu Zhu said thoughtfully. “If there’s a chance, buy over the Qiao family.” Lu Zhu didn’t want his precious sister to be targeted by such a despicable person.

When the secretary heard Lu Zhu’s words, she was slightly stunned. She hurriedly said, “Director Lu, this isn’t appropriate!”

“What’s wrong with that? Go and formulate a plan to buy over the Qiao family first. When the time comes, I’ll see if it’s feasible. If possible, I’ll buy it.” Lu Zhu knew in his heart that Qiao Yu was the only one supporting the Qiao family now.

The news that Qiao Yu was a genius had spread throughout An City. Coupled with the fact that Qiao Yu was extremely outstanding, he had to be very thorough in dealing with the Qiao family.

“Director Lu, I’ve also found out that Second Young Master Gu is fighting for that piece of land,” the secretary said in all seriousness.

A trace of confusion flashed in Lu Zhu’s eyes.

Gu Zhou rarely made a move. Could it be that Gu Zhou wanted to avenge Sugar?

“No matter who has this piece of land, as long as it’s not in the hands of the Qiao family, it’s fine.” Lu Zhu’s eyes darkened. He had to make the Qiao family suffer.

“By the way, Director Lu, I’ve also found out something about Miss Song Yu.”

… .

At this moment, Gu Qing and Su Sheng were already standing outside the piano room.

Su Sheng had a bad feeling about this. If she remembered correctly, Qiao Nian had walked in this direction when she came out of the elevator.

Su Sheng’s face gradually turned pale.

Why had Qiao Nian walked this way?

Could it be that Qiao Nian had also been invited by Mr. Dong Hua?

She knew that Qiao Nian was Mr. Dong Hua’s musician in the past, but so what?

What kind of person was Mr. Dong Hua?

He was a genius musician. How could he invite a female musician to listen to a new song?

Unless Qiao Nian already had a special relationship with Mr. Dong Hua.

Su Sheng gradually clenched her fists.

Qiao Nian not only had an ambiguous relationship with Lu Zhu and Gu Zhou, but also with Mr. Dong Hua.

Qiao Nian was very good-looking, but Su Sheng hated people who deceived people using their looks.

No wonder Qiao Nian didn’t have Mr. Dong Hua’s limited edition album. Just think about it. How could a successful man give such expensive things to a woman he was fooling around with?

At the thought of this, Su Sheng felt a trace of comfort.

It seemed that it was just a coincidence that Qiao Nian was walking in this direction.

Gu Qing stood at the side and saw Su Sheng’s change in expression. She frowned.

Previously, Su Sheng’s emotions had been a little off.

Gu Qing glanced around. Seeing that there was no one else around, she walked over to Su Sheng and asked in a low voice, “Sheng Sheng, are you feeling unwell?”

When Su Sheng heard Gu Qing’s words, she hurriedly shook her head and said, “Senior Sister, I’m fine.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“You look like you’re in a panic. You seem to be guarding against something. Did something happen?” Gu Qing was a psychiatrist, so Su Sheng’s expression naturally couldn’t escape her eyes.

When Su Sheng heard Gu Qing’s words, her eyes froze for a moment. She bit her lip and said half-truthfully, “Actually, it’s not a big deal. It’s just that I accidentally had a conflict with Miss Qiao previously, and things got a little unpleasant. I’ve been thinking about this matter!”

When Gu Qing heard Su Sheng’s words, she recalled how she had interacted with Qiao Nian. Qiao Nian had a carefree personality and was very good at handling matters. She was not a petty person.
