Chapter 515: Trust Her

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian had never expected her brother, who she had always thought was gentle, to have such a cold and ruthless side.

Besides, her brother was right. Song Yue should have died in Ghost City long ago.

“If she comes to her senses and finds out who you are, she’ll spread the word and put you in danger.”

At this point, Lu Zhu hid the coldness in his eyes and his voice became warm. “Sugar, I once told you that I wouldn’t put you in danger again.”

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Zhu’s words, her eyes couldn’t help but turn red. It felt so good to be protected. “Brother, you’re so good to me. In the future, I might not be able to control myself. I might become arrogant after being doted on.”

Lu Zhu reached out and gently tapped Qiao Nian’s nose. He smiled dotingly and said softly, “My sister has the right.”

Qiao Nian smiled in embarrassment. She helped Lu Zhu to the bed and asked curiously, “Brother, Song Yue just brought out a lot of evidence. Why didn’t you suspect me?”

Seeing the bright smile on Qiao Nian’s face, Lu Zhu couldn’t help but swallow. He said softly, “Silly girl, why should I suspect you? It’s all my fault. I lost you by accident. I didn’t protect you well enough and didn’t find you sooner.”

Qiao Nian looked at Lu Zhu in confusion.

“Did you realize that the two of us were related when you were in the operating theater?” Lu Zhu asked.

Qiao Nian was slightly taken aback, but she quickly reacted and nodded. “Okay.”

“That’s why you gave them hush money to keep it quiet. If you hadn’t done that, news of our relationship might have spread back long ago. At that time, you would have become a target.” Lu Zhu paused and continued, “If I had woken up then, I would have made the same decision.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Qiao Nian’s uneasiness instantly dissipated. Her eyes were filled with joy as she said softly, “Brother, so you understand everything!”

“You’ve worked so hard to survive until now. Every step you take is very careful.” Lu Zhu held Qiao Nian’s hand and said warmly, “However, you don’t have to be so careful in the future. With me around, I’ll definitely protect you well.”

Qiao Nian’s heart warmed and her eyes reddened. So Brother already knew everything.

“If you weren’t my biological sister, with your achievements, how could you insist on being my sister? This is all my fault. If I hadn’t brought Song Yue over, how could you have suffered?”

Hearing Lu Zhu’s words, Qiao Nian held his hand tightly. “Brother, if you hadn’t brought her here and if you hadn’t experienced all this, I wouldn’t have the chance to acknowledge you. I know that with you around, you definitely wouldn’t let me suffer.”

When Qiao Nian reached the end of her sentence, her voice broke. She was really too easily touched.

She recalled the situation when she returned to the Qiao family. At that time, everyone treated her coldly and she did not receive any love.

So this was what real family meant. Real family put her first.

“Thank you, Brother.”

“Actually, I should be the one thanking you!”

As soon as Lu Zhu finished speaking, the door opened.

Qiao Nian and Lu Zhu looked over and saw Xu Qian standing nervously at the door of the ward. Her expression was complicated. After thinking for a long time, she walked in.

Xu Qian pursed her lips and mustered her courage. She explained, “M-Mr. Lu, Li Na is a person who keeps her promises, so she didn’t say anything. However, I didn’t take any money, so I can tell you the truth. Actually, Doctor Qiao didn’t give you a blood transfusion because when you were having surgery, there was a hemolysis. Only then did I realize that she was related to you by blood.”
