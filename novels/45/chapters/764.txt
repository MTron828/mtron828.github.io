765 Misunderstanding

“I know. Actually, I can’t wait to have a child with you.”

Qiao Nian was speechless.

“Nian’er, let’s hold a wedding first before having a child!” Gu Zhou’s serious voice came through the phone.

Qiao Nian’s face grew redder and redder, not knowing what to say.

“We can have a few more children. We’ll give Gu Qi a younger brother first, then give him a younger sister. What do you think?”

This time, Qiao Nian was very sure that Gu Zhou really wanted to be with her.

Qiao Nian thought about Xiao Shi and how she had to ensure that Gu Zhou wouldn’t be agitated. After all, she couldn’t affect Gu Zhou’s condition.

She didn’t want the other personalities in Gu Zhou’s body were released, especially Gu Chuan. Although Gu Chuan had not appeared for a long time, she was not sure if he had really disappeared.

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but sigh.

It was really too difficult for her.

“I won’t talk to you anymore. The meal is ready. I’ll eat with Xiao Qi!”

After Qiao Nian hung up, she heaved a sigh of relief.

Gu Zhou’s words still rang in her ears for a long time.

Qiao Nian felt her face grow hotter and hotter.

At this moment, Gu Qi’s voice came from the kitchen door.

“Auntie Nian Nian, is lunch ready?”

Qiao Nian turned around and saw Gu Qi walking in.

Qiao Nian smiled and said, “It’s already done. You can wait for me in the dining room with Xiao Shi.”

“Auntie Nian Nian, what are the dishes for lunch today?” Gu Qi didn’t leave immediately. Instead, he looked at Qiao Nian curiously and asked. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Sour and spicy shredded potatoes, spicy chicken, stewed pork ribs, and rice. I wonder if Xiao Shi will like it,” Qiao Nian said with a smile.

When Gu Qi heard Qiao Nian’s words, his eyes curved up.

These dishes were all his favorites.

Auntie Nian Nian remembered his favorite dishes.

But he didn’t know if his sister would like these.

“Auntie Nian Nian, when we eat later, can you scoop more meat into my sister’s bowl?” Gu Qi looked up at Qiao Nian and whispered.

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Qi’s words, she was slightly stunned. She recalled how thin and weak she was and nodded with a smile. “Of course. She should eat more meat when she’s young!”

“When you’re scooping meat for your sister, don’t let her feel that we’re pitying her. Is that okay?”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Qi’s words, she was completely stunned.

In the past, she had always thought that Gu Qi was slow in relationships.

But at this moment, she realized something.

Gu Qi was very smart. His intelligence was not only reflected in his high IQ, but also in his high EQ.

Gu Qi was clearly so young, but he already knew how to take care of other people’s emotions.

Perhaps it was because Gu Qi was related to Xiao Shi by blood that he could understand Xiao Shi better and take better care of her.

Qiao Nian reached out and patted Gu Qi’s head, smiling as she agreed.

“Thank you, Auntie Nian Nian. Then I’ll call my sister over for dinner now!” Gu Qi gave a satisfied smile and walked out.

Qiao Nian looked gently at Gu Qi’s retreating back. If her child was still alive, he would definitely be as adorable and understanding as Gu Qi was!

Qiao Nian’s phone rang again. She opened it and saw that it was a photo of the DNA report her student had sent her.

Things were indeed as she had expected.

Xiao Shi was really related to Gu Qi by blood. The two of them were biological siblings.

Qiao Nian’s heart gradually settled back into her stomach. She had to think of a way to reunite her and Gu Zhou.

Qiao Nian brought out all the dishes. She scooped three large bowls of pork ribs. There were many pork ribs in every bowl.

After she placed the dishes, she saw Gu Qi and Xiao Shi walking towards the dining room hand in hand.

Qiao Nian smiled at them and said, “You have to wash your hands before eating!”

Xiao Shi smelled the fragrance coming from the dining table. When she saw the dishes on the dining table, her eyes couldn’t help but turn red.

She really couldn’t believe that she could eat such delicious food.

Auntie Nian Nian had made this for her.

It was really too fragrant. The roundworms in her stomach were about to be hooked out.
