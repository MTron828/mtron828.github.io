811 Ruthless

Qiao Xin glanced worriedly at the operating theater. After some thought, she said, “Sure, I’ll meet anytime!”

“Why don’t we have dinner tonight?”

“Okay!” Qiao Xin nodded.

Qiao Xin thought of Su Xue, who was covered in wounds in the operating theater. A trace of coldness flashed in her eyes, but her voice was as gentle as ever. “Sister Man Man, I’ll find a time for you to meet the Lu family, and I’ll help you regain your status as Miss Lu. However, don’t forget what you promised me previously.”

“I remember. Moreover, I’ve already asked my little helper to do it. She looks innocent and won’t attract Qiao Nian’s attention. When Qiao Nian notices, she will already be beyond redemption. Just wait for the good news of my success!”

“Thank you, Sister Man Man!” Qiao Xin said sincerely.

A trace of smugness flashed in Qiao Xin’s eyes. When Sister Man Man returned, she would be able to kill Qiao Nian!

“We’re good friends. You don’t have to be so polite!”

The woman on the other end of the line hung up after saying this.

In the mirror of the bathroom in the service area of the highway, there was a breathtakingly beautiful face.

The woman smiled. Everything around her dimmed.

This woman was none other than Xiao Shi’s mother, Song Man.

Song Man stared unblinkingly at the mirror. Her red lips curved up slightly, and her eyes were filled with coldness. Her gaze was so cold that it made one shiver.

Soon, she would get what she wanted. She would no longer have to suffer. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Her gaze gradually moved down to her broken arm. Her red lips were pursed tightly, and she looked displeased.

At this moment, someone walked in.

The ruthlessness on Song Man’s face instantly disappeared. She walked out of the bathroom gently.

Song Man had just walked out when she saw Qin Chuan walking towards her not far away. She gave a gentle and fragile smile and said gently, “Mr. Qin, I’m much better now. Let’s go!”

“Can you still hold on?” Qin Chuan asked with concern. They could have arrived in An City at noon today, but because Song Man’s stomach hurt, they had already been delayed in this service area for more than half an hour.

Song Man smiled gently. Her hair swayed as she shook her head, making her look fragile and beautiful. “Thank you for your concern, Mr. Qin. It doesn’t hurt anymore.”

“If you’re not feeling well, feel free to tell me.” Qin Chuan and Song Man walked out together.

Song Man smiled and nodded.

The two of them walked outside. Qin Chuan looked at his subordinates and said, “Alright, we can set off!”

Song Man looked at Qin Chuan’s back as Gu Zhou’s face flashed across her mind. If it weren’t for the fact that she liked Gu Zhou, she might really have fallen for a gentle man like Qin Chuan.

Song Man quickened her pace and walked shoulder to shoulder with Qin Chuan. She turned to look at him and asked, “Mr. Qin, how long will it take us to arrive?”

Qin Chuan took out his phone and glanced at it. There was a traffic jam ahead. He didn’t know how long it would last.

He made a simple estimation and said, “It’ll probably take another three hours!”

“Okay!” Song Man nodded.

…

After Qiao Nian left the Qiao family home, she went straight to the cafe. She found a corner and ordered a cup of coffee, then looked at the diary in her hand seriously.

She had always felt that she had suffered a lot in the past. After reading the diary, she realized that although her life in the countryside had many setbacks, there was also a lot of joy.

It was just like what she had told Xiao Shi previously. She had almost given the dust on her body to Eldest Senior Brother as a life-saving pill.

In the past, in order to catch fireflies, she had specially gone to the rice field on summer nights to wait. However, what awaited her in the end was not fireflies, but heavy rain.

When Qiao Nian saw this, she couldn’t help but smile. She had been so naughty.

Qiao Nian continued reading. The smile on her face gradually disappeared.

She had followed her grandfather to pick herbs, and then she had almost fallen off the cliff. Fortunately, Qiao Yu had grabbed her back then, so she hadn’t fallen.

From that moment on, she had always treated Qiao Yu as Brother White Shirt.

When she returned to the Qiao family, she realized that Qiao Yu was really her brother.
