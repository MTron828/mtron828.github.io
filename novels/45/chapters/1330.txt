“Yes, yes, yes. But Grandma still hopes that you’ll have some flesh.” Matriarch Gu smiled. Her gaze fell on the child in Qiao Nian’s arms. Seeing that he was sleeping soundly, her lips curved up slightly. She was very satisfied.

This child looked more like Gu Zhou when he was young.

Matriarch Gu recalled Gu Zhou’s childhood. Her eyes couldn’t help but turn red, and her voice choked. “Let’s go in and talk. Don’t stand outside.”

She looked at Lu Zhu, who was behind Qiao Nian. “Ah Zhu, let’s go in!”

Lu Zhu did not greet Matriarch Gu just now because he did not want to disturb their reunion. However, Matriarch Gu was concerned about Sugar first, and then Xiao Bao. He felt much better.

It seemed that Matriarch Gu really doted on her grand daughter-in-law!

Previously, he had been a little dissatisfied with Gu Zhou. His Sugar had not been able to live happily when she was unmarried. She had married Gu Zhou at a young age, and the two of them had even had three children by a freak combination of factors. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

His heart really ached for Sugar, but now that he saw Matriarch Gu’s concerned expression, he gradually felt relieved.

Sugar had not married Gu Zhou to be his slave. Instead, she had found a warm home.

Lu Zhu smiled and nodded. “Okay.”

The moment she entered the villa, Qiao Nian told Matriarch Gu and Lu Zhu and carried Xiao Bao upstairs, placing him on Gu Qi’s bed.

This place should be very unfamiliar to Xiao Bao. After some thought, Qiao Nian placed Gu Qi’s photo beside Xiao Bao and walked out carefully.

When she walked to the living room, she heard Grandma and Big Brother chatting about Gu Qi and Xiao Shi.

If it weren’t for the urgency of the situation, she wouldn’t have left the two children at home.

Before she left, the two children had said that they would wait for her at home obediently.

Now that she had returned, the two children had been taken away by Bai Hui.

At the thought of Bai Hui, a trace of coldness flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes. She walked over to Matriarch Gu and reached out to hold her hand. She asked softly, “Grandma, in your text, you said that she had taken the two children away. Did she say anything else?”

When Matriarch Gu heard Qiao Nian’s words, she recalled what had happened that day and said helplessly, “I really didn’t expect her to come here. When she came, she even brought me some supplements, so I got someone to invite her in.”

After a pause, she continued, “I originally thought that she was here to visit me. At that time, the two children were also in the living room. When she asked, I told her that they were Ah Zhou’s children. When I saw that she was holding Xiao Shi and wanted to talk to her, I wanted to give them some space. I went to the kitchen and asked the servants to make her favorite dishes. When I came out, she was no longer in the living room. I asked the servants, and they were also chased away by her. I only found out after looking at the surveillance cameras that she had taken the children away!”

“I called her, but she kept saying that she was busy.” Matriarch Gu sighed sadly and said sadly, “I knew that she would definitely take good care of the two children, but…”

Matriarch Gu couldn’t say too much about Bai Hui in front of Qiao Nian. In the end, she sighed helplessly.

When Qiao Nian heard Matriarch Gu’s words, the first thing she thought of was Bai Hui’s educational methods.

After Bai Hui took care of Gu Zhou, he suffered from split personality. Not only was he solitary, but he also had an aversion to women in the past.

She still remembered Grandma once saying that Bai Hui did not allow Gu Zhou to eat candy. Zhou Zhou had also said that he really wanted to eat candy.

The more Matriarch Gu thought about it, the more she blamed herself. She was really getting old and useless. “I’m really getting worse and worse. I was deceived by her. I’m worried now that I won’t be able to see the two children there again. If Gu Zhou hadn’t come here back then, I might not have been able to see him.”

“Grandma, don’t be anxious.” Qiao Nian looked at Matriarch Gu and comforted her. “I’ve already gotten someone to investigate her address. There’ll be news soon. When the time comes, I’ll bring the children back!”

“Yes.” Matriarch Gu gripped Qiao Nian’s hand tightly and said seriously, “I’ll go with you.”
