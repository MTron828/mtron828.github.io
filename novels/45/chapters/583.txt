Qiao Nian still remembered that at that time, Lu Zhu was standing outside, unwilling to enter. She heard from others that Lu Zhu had been blaming himself for the disappearance of the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

“This is the living room. You often played with this children’s car when you were young. It seemed a little old last year. Grandma got someone to renovate it.”

“This is your bedroom. The pillow on the bed is what you often slept on when you were young. The bed curtains were also your favorite pink color when you were young.”

“This strawberry short skirt was worn on your first birthday.”

“This ancient-style kasaya dress was worn during the new year. At that time, you had your hair tied up in two buns. You looked like a jade-faced dumpling. Previously, in order to make dumplings, you got flour all over your body!”

… .

Qiao Nian looked at the scene on her phone screen. Lu Zhu’s cold voice rang in her ears. Gradually, she began to picture herself living in the Lu family when she was young.

So she had been so happy when she was young.

Unfortunately, she couldn’t remember anything.

Lu Zhu held up his phone and explained every inch of the room to Qiao Nian. As he spoke about the past, the corners of his mouth couldn’t help but curve up. When he accidentally glanced at the screen, he saw that Qiao Nian had already fallen asleep. His eyes were filled with affection. His Sugar was really too obedient and adorable.

“Good night,” Lu Zhu said softly and hung up.

Ever since he returned to the Lu family, he had already gotten someone to investigate Sugar’s kidnapping. Perhaps because he was too excited, he couldn’t fall asleep at night. He secretly got up in the middle of the night and went straight to the villa his family had prepared for Sugar.

Previously, he had called Qiao Nian to see if she had fallen asleep. He didn’t expect Qiao Nian to take a long time to reply.

He really couldn’t wait to tell Sugar about her childhood memories and introduce her to her room.

… .

The next day, when Qiao Nian woke up, it was already past eleven.

She had not taken off her clothes or removed her makeup last night, so she hurriedly went to the bathroom to tidy up. After she was done, she opened the door and was about to go to Gu Qi’s room when she saw Gu Qi squatting beside her door.

“Little Qi?” Seeing Gu Qi squatting there, Qiao Nian hurriedly picked him up and asked worriedly, “How long have you been here?”

Gu Qi’s face was still a little red. His facial features were exquisite, and his eyes were flickering.

Qiao Nian touched Gu Qi’s forehead with her other hand. Fortunately, he didn’t have a fever.

“He’s been waiting for you here.” Gu Zhou came out of the room next door and glanced at Gu Qi’s face. Then, he said, “It’s been more than an hour.”

“Little Qi, why didn’t you wake me up?” Qiao Nian picked Gu Qi up and walked towards his room.

When she passed by Gu Zhou, he naturally gave way. She even saw Gu Qi’s smug expression.

Gu Zhou pursed his lips and remained silent.

When Qiao Nian placed Gu Qi on the bed, Gu Qi said in a childish voice, “Auntie is tired.”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. Her gaze fell on Gu Qi’s face and she reached out to touch his cheek. “Did Little Qi sleep well last night?”

Gu Qi nodded. He looked at Qiao Nian with his grape-like eyes and said in a childish voice, “Little Qi wants to visit Auntie before we go home.”

“What?” Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. Only then did she realize that Gu Qi was referring to his own home. She looked at Gu Qi with heartache. This child had never been doted on since he was young. “Little Qi, don’t go back anymore. Can’t you stay here?”

Gu Qi’s pupils dilated uncontrollably. He thought he had heard wrongly, and his voice faltered. “Auntie, are you saying…”

“Little Qi.” Qiao Nian looked at Gu Qi gently, as if she was looking at herself when she was young. She had always yearned to live with her parents. “This will be your home from now on. You’ll live here, okay?”
