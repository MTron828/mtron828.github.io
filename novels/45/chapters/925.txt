926 Harassment

Qiao Nian ignored the man and was about to leave when the other men blocked her path.

Qiao Nian was in a bad mood. She said impatiently, “I advise you to move aside. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being impolite!”

“Little beauty, how do you want to be impolite?” The man was lecherous. He rubbed his hands in front of him, his eyes almost glued to Qiao Nian’s chest.

“I’ll say it one last time. Get out of my way!” Qiao Nian said coldly. Her voice was cold, and her eyes were slightly narrowed, exuding a dangerous coldness.

!!

“Little beauty, if your temper is too explosive, you won’t be welcomed!” The man smiled at Qiao Nian, like a vicious wolf seeing meat. His eyes were shining. “It’s getting late. Why don’t we get a room and have some fun?”

The people standing behind the man smiled and nodded.

“Little beauty, come and play with us. I’ll definitely serve you well.”

“The few of us are one in a hundred. You’re lucky to meet us today!”

“We can try all sorts of positions. Little beauty, don’t be too shy!”

Qiao Nian’s expression darkened. Frowning, she asked coldly, “Did Qiao Xin ask you to come?”

This was all Qiao Xin could do. All these years, she had not improved at all.

She even used such an old-fashioned method to ruin her reputation.

Qiao Nian clenched her fists tightly. It seemed that Qiao Xin wouldn’t have a good life anymore.

At this moment, the short and thin man standing on the left pulled off Qiao Nian’s shawl when she wasn’t paying attention.

Qiao Nian’s round shoulders and sexy collarbone were clearly visible.

The others looked at Qiao Nian’s shoulder and their eyes instantly turned red. They were almost drooling.

“Her skin is so fair. There probably isn’t concealer!”

“This figure is comparable to a model!”

“She’s indeed top-notch. Brothers, let’s enjoy ourselves!”

… .

The short and thin man wanted to pull off Qiao Nian’s shawl, but a hand grabbed his wrist.

“Ah!” The short and thin man screamed in pain.

At this moment, everyone heard a crack. The short and thin man’s arm was dislocated.

Actually, Qiao Nian could deal with them herself. She didn’t need anyone to protect her. Seeing that someone was helping her, she turned to look at the man standing beside her.

The man was very tall, about 1.9 meters tall. He had a stalwart figure.

The man was holding a tissue in his hand, wiping his hands slowly. Then, he threw the tissue in his hand at the man whose arm he had dislocated. He looked up slightly, his beautiful fox-like eyes filled with disgust as they swept across the men in front of him.

The men who were looking for trouble felt a chill run down their spines as they looked at each other.

The man turned to look at Qiao Nian. Seeing that Qiao Nian’s shawl had already been torn, he naturally took off his suit jacket and draped it over Qiao Nian’s shoulders, wrapping them with it.

“A beautiful and noble girl shouldn’t dirty her hands for these bedbugs!”

With that, the man looked sharply at the hooligans in front of him. Slowly, he rolled up the sleeves of his shirt and took a step forward, shielding Qiao Nian behind him.

Qiao Nian’s expression faltered slightly. For some reason, she felt that this man looked a little familiar, as if she had seen him somewhere before.

However, she was certain that she had never seen the man in front of her. Her heart began to race involuntarily.

The leader of the group was called He Cheng. His expression was a little ugly as he questioned coldly, “Fourth Master, this has nothing to do with you. I advise you not to cause trouble!”

After the man rolled up his sleeves, he glanced at the people in front of him and said, “You’re not allowed to touch this woman!”

He Cheng’s expression instantly darkened. He was considered a well-known figure here, but he didn’t expect someone to go against him in public. He pursed his lips slightly and said solemnly, “Fourth Master, you don’t usually care about these things. If you insist on interfering, don’t blame me for being impolite!”
