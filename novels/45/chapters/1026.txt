1027 Telling on Me Again

“Fourth Brother, how can you be so bad! You’re telling on me again!” Lu Qi stuck her head out and said angrily.

Lu Jiang said calmly, “You’re still young to begin with. We don’t plan to bring you to the next gathering.”

Lu Qi frowned. Her brothers and sister were much older than her. She watched them play outside every day. Of course, she wanted to play too.

For example, going to a bar!

Although she didn’t like bars, she felt that she should go out and play!

She felt that she should see everything when she was alive.

Song Yu looked at Lu Qi’s angry expression and said with a smile, “Where do you want to go in the future? If the three of us are free, we can go together.”

With that, Song Yu turned to look at Qiao Nian. “Sister, is that okay?”

Although Qiao Nian didn’t like Song Yu’s way of speaking, she still looked fine. She smiled and nodded. “Okay.”

When Lu Qi heard this, she looked at Lu Jiang smugly and said sarcastically, “Fourth Brother, even if you beg me in the future, I won’t go with you!”

Seeing them bicker, Matriarch Lu smiled and shook her head. “Alright, alright, stop fooling around. Now, the two of you will pray to the ancestors together! It’s best if you get married in one year and have children in two years!”

Matriarch Lu was indirectly urging them to get married. Her gaze fell on her four grandchildren. “As brothers, you have to set an example and get married as soon as possible.”

With that, Matriarch Lu looked at Song Yu and couldn’t help but exhort, “Little Sixth, Grandma only has one request for you. When you find a boyfriend, you have to find someone with good character. We don’t want to see an indecent man!”

“Yes, Grandma,” Song Yu agreed obediently.

Song Yu felt refreshed. Perhaps it was because she had changed her perspective of her surroundings.

Matriarch Lu finally looked at Lu Qi and said, “You, study hard. You’ll find a boyfriend after you graduate.”

“Yes,” Lu Qi agreed obediently.

Matriarch Lu gave them a few more reminders. In the end, she asked them to bow again. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

After everyone bowed, Gu Zhou held Qiao Nian’s hand and smiled at her.

Qiao Nian sensed Gu Zhou’s gaze and turned to look at him. The two of them looked at each other and smiled.

She felt very happy. The happiness she had not dared to hope for in the past had actually happened.

She only hoped that she could continue to be happy like this.

After acknowledging their roots and ancestors, Matriarch Lu led the group of people towards the cafeteria.

When she walked to the dining hall, Auntie Dong was arranging the dishes. When she saw Qiao Nian, the smile on her face grew brighter.

In the past, when Qiao Nian came to the Lu family, she had felt that she looked a little familiar. Moreover, she felt that Qiao Nian’s back looked very similar to Madam’s.

At that time, she hadn’t thought too much about it. She really hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to really be the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

Auntie Dong said respectfully, “Congratulations on returning home, Eldest Miss!”

Qiao Nian felt that the person in front of her looked a little familiar. She smiled and nodded.

Seeing the smile on Qiao Nian’s face, Auntie Dong was slightly stunned. In a daze, she seemed to see the young version of Madam.

Lu Qi stood beside Qiao Nian and explained, “Auntie Dong is Mom’s good friend. The two of them grew up together. Later on, Mom married Dad, and Auntie Dong followed her here.”

“What nonsense are you spouting?” Matriarch Lu said, her head aching.

“Auntie Dong came with Mom. Grandma wanted Auntie Dong to take care of Mom,” Lu Qi explained seriously again.

“Alright, the food is ready. Everyone, sit down and eat!” Auntie Dong smiled and gestured for everyone to sit down. She called for the maids to bring the glutinous rice balls over.

Auntie Dong smiled and said, “It’s a joyous occasion that Eldest Miss has returned home. I heard that Eldest Miss likes strawberry-flavored glutinous rice balls, so I specially prepared them.”

Matriarch Lu smiled gently and said, “You’re still the most meticulous.”

“Ah, Second Brother made a full Imperial Feast!” Lu Qi exclaimed.

Song Yu smiled as well and said expectantly, “Second Brother’s cooking is the best!”

Lu Nian’s gentle gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face, as if he was waiting for her to speak.

Qiao Nian looked at the delicious-looking food on the table and smiled at Lu Nian. She said sweetly, “Thank you, Second Brother!”
