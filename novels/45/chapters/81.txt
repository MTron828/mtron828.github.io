Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

Matriarch Gu took out the will again and wrote Qiao Nian’s name down in the space reserved for the heir of her inheritance.

Zhao Qian lowered her gaze, hiding the disappointment in her eyes. Very quickly, she put on a bright smile.

Matriarch Gu carefully placed her thumbprint on the will before putting the document back in the cabinet. Seeing that Zhao Qian was still smiling, Matriarch Gu knew that Zhao Qian was alright with her decision, and was even more satisfied with her. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Qian Qian.” Holding onto Zhao Qian’s hand, Matriarch Gu said gently, “Nian Nian is a sensible girl. She will have to act as a pillar for the entire Gu family in the future. I believe that she will definitely take good care of everyone in the Gu family. She won’t mistreat you.”

Before Zhao Qian could speak, Matriarch Gu continued,

e already prepared your dowry since you were a child. Don’t worry, Grandma won’t let you down either.”

Zhao Qian’s eyes turned red. She shook her head vigorously and said in a choked voice, “Grandma, I hope that you can live to a hundred years old. I want to stay by your side for the rest of my life. I don’t mind having no assets at all. I also believe that Second Sister-in-law can take good care of the entire

Gu family!”

Matriarch Gu knew that Zhao Qian was speaking from her heart. This child had only known one thing since she was young—how to be filial. She knew very little of anything else.

While she was still alive, she had to help Zhao Qian find a good husband.

Qiao Nian heard only Zhao Qian’s comments about her, and heard nothing after that. She walked directly downstairs.

After taking a few steps, she saw Gu Zhou walking out of his room. He stood in the corridor, his face pale.

“Twas just looking for you.” Qiao Nian quickly walked towards Gu Zhou and said, “Wait a little while.”

As she spoke, Qiao Nian entered her room and took out a medicine bottle. Just as she was about to pass it to Gu Zhou, she heard Gu Zhou speak.

“How did your blind date go?”

Qiao Nian froze for a second. She knew it. She had been wondering how Chen Qing had known that she was at the cafe today when she had left the house alone.

So Gu Zhou had arranged for someone to keep an eye on her. Look, now he was here to interrogate her for her crimes.

Qiao Nian placed her hands behind her back and looked up. A lovely smile appeared on her face. “Master Gu, are you not confident? Tell me, how many men in this world can compare to you?”

The greeting of “Master Gu’ left Gu Zhou stunned for a moment. His brow, which had been deeply furrowed, gradually relaxed. He leaned against the door and looked at the woman’s little face, which was tilted playfully in his direction. He felt extremely pleased.

“Why are you looking for me?” Gu Zhou looked down at Qiao Nian. His gaze fell on her cherry-red lips. Somehow, he couldn’t move his eyes away.

“Here’s your medicine.” Qiao Nian shook the bottle, allowing one pill to fall into her palm, and brought the pill to Gu Zhou’s lips. “Here, try it.”

Qiao Nian’s tone was as if she had prepared an amazing meal for Gu Zhou to try. However, when Gu Zhou looked at the mud-like round pill in Qiao Nian’s hand, he could only frown.

“Is this edible?”

Seeing that Gu Zhou clearly didn’t think much of the pill, Qiao Nian explained patiently, “Although it looks ugly, it’s very effective. It’s good for your health.”

After Qiao Nian spoke, she saw that Gu Zhou had opened his mouth and was about to speak. Without hesitation, she stuffed the pill into his mouth.

Gu Zhou’s entire heart was against eating it, but as soon as the pill entered his mouth, he tasted the faint aroma of strawberry. It was not as bad as he had imagined.

Qiao Nian had adjusted the formula for this Miracle All-Healing Pill many times in the past. Worried that Gu Zhou wouldn’t be used to the smell, she even added strawberry flavor to the recipe.

“How is it?” Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in anticipation. She was a little worried that Gu Zhou would dislike the taste.

“I’s not bad,” Gu Zhou said calmly, his expression indifferent.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou intently. Seeing that he didn’t seem to dislike it, she smiled and stuffed the medicine bottle into Gu Zhou’s hand. “One pill each before lunch and dinner.”

Gu Zhou looked dazedly at the blue and white porcelain bottle in his hand.

“Come on, let’s go eat!” Qiao Nian smiled at Gu Zhou. Seeing that he was hesitating to speak, she asked in confusion, “Is there anything else you wanted to speak to me about?”

“How long have you been the principal of An University?” Gu Zhou’s voice was cool and pleasant to the ear, as always..
