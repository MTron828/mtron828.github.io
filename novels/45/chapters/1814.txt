Chapter 1815 - 1815 Urging Her to Get Married

“Grandpa, where did you hide it? I can’t find it no matter what. Coincidentally, you’re back. Let’s go home together this time and take out the wine to drink!” Qiao Nian smiled until her eyes narrowed into a line. “Grandpa’s wine will definitely be the best.”

“You can’t drink that wine casually.” Old Master Qin shook his head. “I brewed it specially for you.”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned.

Old Master Qin continued, “Usually, when a young lady is born, a family will store some wine at home. That wine is called Daughter’s Red. When their daughter gets married, they would take out the wine and drink it. I’ll brew a few more jars of wine for you in two days.”

Qiao Nian felt Old Master Qin’s love and held his arm. “Grandpa, it’ll be hard on you again.”

Old Master Qin patted Qiao Nian’s hand gently. “Silly child, what’s wrong?”

As soon as he finished speaking, he seemed to have thought of something and his expression turned serious. He asked seriously, “When do you and Ah Zhou plan to hold your wedding?”

“He said before that when the matter is resolved, we can prepare for the wedding.” Qiao Nian thought of Lina’s marriage and a lot of complicated matters. She frowned. “Grandpa, actually, I think things are good now. The wedding is especially troublesome. I…”

“Nian Nian, you don’t understand.” Old Master Qin shook his head in disapproval. “Marriage is a sacred and solemn matter. A wedding has to be held. Grandpa has always wanted to see you get married and give you the Daughter’s Red I prepared for you.”

“It’s said that a bride is the most beautiful person in the world. I hope my Nian Nian can have such a beautiful moment.” Old Master Qin looked at the bright smile on Qiao Nian’s face and recalled the first time he had seen her.

The little girl who wore thin clothes in the cold had grown up.

Qiao Nian nodded. “Okay.”

“Junior Sister, I’ve prepared a gift for you a long time ago. It’s not expensive though.” Chang Feng’s eyes were gentle. He only spoke after a long time.

He knew the Gu family and the Lu family’s financial resources, and he didn’t have that much money. All he could do was put in more effort when choosing gifts.

They grew up together. At that time, he often tutored Little Junior Sister in her studies and medical skills. He even brought Little Junior Sister out to pick herbs and play. At night, he told stories to Little Junior Sister to coax her to sleep.

However, his little junior sister had already grown up and was no longer the little girl who needed him to coax her to sleep.

Chang Feng was in a daze. Time passed so quickly.

When Qiao Nian heard Chang Feng’s words, she shook her head and said seriously, “Eldest Senior Brother, don’t say that. As long as you give me a gift, I’ll definitely like it very much and even treat it as a treasure.”

Qiao Nian looked away from Chang Feng. Among the three siblings, Eldest Senior Brother had it the hardest. He had experienced too much pain and done very dangerous things, but he had never said anything. He would even give his gentlene love to her and Qin Chuan.

For so many years, Eldest Senior Brother had doted on them, but no one could help him share the burden of danger around him. Eldest Senior Brother could only face it alone.

The last time she was at MY Hospital, Eldest Senior Brother had even been injured. She had even shot him personally.

Old Master Qin tilted his head and looked at Chang Feng beside him. He said earnestly, “Chang Feng, I advise you to quickly find a partner. You’re not young anymore. It’s time for you to start a family.”

When Chang Feng heard Old Master Qin’s words, he only lowered his head and smiled faintly without saying anything.

Lu Qi walked behind Old Master Qin. As he listened to their conversation, a smile gradually appeared in his eyes.

Fortunately, her sister had grown up with Old Master Qin, so she did not grow up alone.

Qin Chuan followed Lu Qi’s gaze and smiled. He took over after Old Master Qin spoke and said, “When we were young, Grandpa urged us to study hard and learn other things. Now, Grandpa has already begun to urge us to get married.”

Old Master Qin turned around and smiled at Qin Chuan. He asked, “Could it be that I’m wrong?”Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com
