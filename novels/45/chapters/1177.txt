1178 Dead?

The surgery went very smoothly. He carefully examined Sugar’s body. When he extracted her bone marrow, he paid special attention and had already minimized the damage to Sugar. Sugar only needed to recuperate well. There shouldn’t be any major problems in the future.

Thank you readers!

On the surface, he was operating on that woman’s daughter. Then, he secretly tampered with Sugar’s instrument.

The surgery on that woman’s daughter was completed very well. After the surgery, the bodyguards took that woman’s daughter away. The remaining bodyguards originally wanted to shoot Little Lu Nian to death. Suddenly, they saw a beep from the instrument, and a straight line was displayed on the instrument table!

“Is this child dead?” The lead bodyguard looked at the instrument table and asked with a frown.

“Yes, she’s already dead!” Shen An lowered his head and pretended to be sad. “She’s still young. Her bone marrow was extracted and she couldn’t survive!”

“It saved me a bullet!” The bodyguard said as he put away his gun and prepared to bury Little Lu Nian. “I’ll find a hole to bury her now!”

“I’ll go bury her!” Shen An was worried that the bodyguard would discover that Little Lu Nian was still breathing and her heart was beating. He said seriously, “I was the one who operated on her and caused her death. If the police find her corpse, they’ll find me too. I don’t want the police to know what I’ve done. I’m a forensic doctor. I can hide her corpse well. I won’t let her be discovered!”

The bodyguard thought for a while. Since the forensic doctor could check the time of death of the corpse, he must have a way to destroy the corpse so that the police could not find any clues.

Shen An picked Little Lu Nian up and looked up at the bodyguard. He said solemnly, “We have to drive and bury her further away. If we’re too close, the police will know that we’ve undergone surgery here. The risk is too great!” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

When the bodyguard heard Shen An’s words, he felt that that was the case. Hence, he reported the situation to the woman through his earpiece.

The woman had no intention of letting Little Lu Nian live to begin with. Now that someone had helped destroy the corpse, she was naturally very happy, so she agreed!

The bodyguard covered Shen An’s eyes again and drove him somewhere else.

About half an hour later, they arrived at a village ten kilometers away!

Shen An knew that because his daughter was still in their hands, that woman was fearless enough to ask him to deal with Little Lu Nian’s corpse.

After Shen An got out of the car, he carried Lu Nian into the forest. As he walked in, he turned back to look at the car. He had at most ten minutes to settle Little Lu Nian down. If he took too long, those people might discover that he had ill intentions and harm his daughter!

Carrying Little Lu Nian, he quickly ran towards the village not far away. He was taking a gamble.

If he won the bet, he, his daughter, and Little Lu Nian would be saved!

If he lost, his daughter might not be around anymore. He and Little Lu Nian might be hurt.

But now, he couldn’t care less. It was fine as long as he could save Little Lu Nian!

After arriving at that place, he realized that this was the Su family village, a small village four hours away from An City.

If that woman had spies in the Lu family or the police, she might kill his daughter to vent her anger!

For now, he could only hide Little Lu Nian’s identity and not alert the enemy. That way, not only could he save Little Lu Nian, but he might also save his daughter!

This was the best solution!

With this thought in mind, he gave up on borrowing a cell phone from someone. He went to the convenience store and asked around about the best families in the village. He then left a letter in Little Lu Nian’s bag.

It was said that Widow Wang in the village was a kind person. She had been a widow since her young husband died. He asked for Widow Wang’s address, and he brought Little Lu Nian to Widow Wang’s house.

Previously, when his daughter was kidnapped, he thought that the other party was after money and had a cheque for six million yuan.
