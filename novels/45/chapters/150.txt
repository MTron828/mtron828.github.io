Chapter 151 Truly Capable?

Trying hard to calm herself down, Jiang Yue kept a smile on her face.

Because of Qiao Nian, Jiang Yue’s spot as the first speaker had been snatched from her. Hence, many people were extremely displeased with Qiao Nian.

“Senior Jiang is such a good-tempered person. How is she keeping her calm? I wonder who exactly Qiao Nian is. How dare she snatch the role of first speaker from Senior Jiang? How shameless is she?”

“I wonder what the organizers of the event are thinking. They found an idiot to open the ceremony. Isn’t this looking down on the Second Academy?”. “This is so infuriating.”

Liu Yu had been following Jiang Yue around. Listening to the words of those people, she felt a wave of indignation for Jiang Yue.

Qiao Nian was truly disgusting. She was everywhere.

Before she arrived, Liu Yu had been thinking that if Jiang Yu were to make an appearance at this ceremony, she would definitely benefit greatly, being Jiang Yue’s good friend. However, she hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to interfere once again.

Jiang Yue didn’t seem to be able to hear the complaints of the surrounding onlookers. She smiled and walked up to Qiao Nian. Holding onto Qiao Nian’s hand happily, she said with affection in her voice, “Sister Nian Nian, you’ve arrived early. Previously, Grandma asked us to come here together, didn’t she?”

As Jiang Yue spoke, her gaze swept around the crowd.

Qiao Nian retracted her hand without batting an eyelid. Raising her hand, she tucked her hair behind her ear, her expression cold.

Gu Zhou’s eyes darkened as he looked at Jiang Yue. His expression was complicated.

Lin Tao, who was standing beside Qiao Nian, frowned.

Jiang Yue had spoken very loudly just now, attracting the attention of many people nearby.

“Sister Nian Nian.” Jiang Yue’s words were like a bomb. Initially, everyone had been curious about who Qiao Nian was. When they heard Jiang Yue’s words, they instantly understood that the person Jiang Yue had addressed as Sister Nian Nian was Qiao Nian herself.

Everyone’s gazes fell on Qiao Nian’s face. All of them were stunned by Qiao Nian’s beauty. However, when they remembered that the person in front of them was the first speaker of tonight, they could only feel jealousy and displeasure.

One of Jiang Yue’s suitors questioned unhappily, “Are you Qiao Nian? Are you the one who stole Senior Jiang’s position as the first lecturer?”

Lin Tao glared at the suitor and rolled her eyes, displeasure written all over her face.

She finally understood why Gu Zhou didn’t like Jiang Yue. A calculating and petty woman like this was truly detestable. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

When Jiang Yue heard the boy’s words, she turned to glare at him, looking extremely displeased. She smiled at Qiao Nian. In a considerate, understanding manner, she said, “Sister Nian Nian is someone who’s truly capable. This student here, please don’t spout nonsense. You’re embarrassing our school.”

Lin Tao frowned.

Listen.

“Truly capable.”

What did this mean?

Was she implying something else, and attempting to smear Qiao Nian’s reputation? “So she’s only the first lecturer because of her family! I bet they funneled a lot of money into the school to get this chance!”

“Don’t be so sure yet. She might have gotten the chance using her body!”

“That’s true. With her face and figure, I’m sure she has what it takes!”

Everyone seemed to have discovered the truth. They looked at Qiao Nian with malice.

Jiang Yue frowned slightly. Her red lips parted slightly in disapproval. “Don’t say that. Qiao Nian is a guest of our family.”

Because the marriage between Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian was still a secret, she could only announce to the public that Qiao Nian was a guest of the Gu family.

When Gu Zhou heard the word “guest”, a trace of displeasure sparked in his heart.

“Haha.” Lin Tao was angered to the point of laughing

Jiang Yue turned around when she heard the voice. When she saw Lin Tao, a trace of surprise flashed in her eyes. She hadn’t expected Director Lin’s precious daughter to come as well. Jiang Yue had always wanted to get to know Director Lin. She knew that Director Lin was extremely prominent in the medical field, so she greeted Lin Tao with a smile. “Miss Lin, you’re here. Has Director Lin come as well?”

Lin Tao walked over to Qiao Nian and took her arm with a smile. She looked up at Jiang Yue with contempt, her expression clearly indicating what she thought of Jiang Yue. To Lin Tao, Jiang Yue was worth nothing. “Why do you care if my father is here? You spoke of true capability, but you didn’t even make clear what sort of capability you’re referring to. Are you trying to inspire gossip? To encourage others to let their imaginations run wild? Your acting skills are not bad. Why would you want to study medicine? You might as well study how to write movie scripts.”
