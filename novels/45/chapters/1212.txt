1213 Exposing Identities 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Gu Zhou’s body stiffened slightly. When he came back to his senses, he realized that Qiao Nian had already reached out and unbuttoned one of his collar buttons.

Without hesitation, Gu Zhou took the initiative and pressed Qiao Nian under him.

The two of them spent the entire afternoon in bed.

Qiao Nian leaned lazily into Gu Zhou’s arms. Her arms ached, and she felt as if she had been pressed down by a machine.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian and gently patted her head. With a satisfied expression, he said to Qiao Nian in a low voice, “I want to test Mr. Chen again.”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she looked up at him and met his sparkling eyes. She lowered her gaze and thought for a moment before saying, “I don’t think it’s appropriate.”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he frowned slightly. “Why do you say that?”

“If he’s not your brother and you didn’t ask him out for a legitimate reason, he probably wouldn’t waste his time on you.” Qiao Nian paused for a moment and continued, “If he’s really your brother, it’s very dangerous for you to meet him. It’s very likely that his identity will be exposed. The reason why he hasn’t returned home for so many years is to hide his identity!”

Seeing that Gu Zhou was silent, Qiao Nian continued, “If his identity is exposed, he might be in extreme danger. Of course, this can only be our guess. Perhaps it’s as you said. He might have lost his memory. But no matter what, I think it’s better if we don’t test him.”

Gu Zhou pulled Qiao Nian into his arms. Actually, he understood everything Qiao Nian was saying, but when he thought about how Mr. Chen was very likely to be his brother, he couldn’t wait to acknowledge him.

Gu Zhou thought for a moment before asking, “If there’s a business deal with him, do you think we can meet?”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she hesitated for a moment. Previously, Jiang Chi had sent an invitation to Mr. Chen, but Mr. Chen didn’t respond. At the thought of this, Qiao Nian said, “He probably won’t meet you. Mr. Chen has many subordinates, and he’s only Old Master Cui’s butler. Basically, Old Master Cui would be the one getting someone to deal with this business. It might not even fall into his hands.”

Gu Zhou was speechless.

Qiao Nian reached out and hugged Gu Zhou, comforting him softly. “Don’t worry. Since there’s already some progress, we can investigate in this direction.”

Gu Zhou knew in his heart that this was the only way. He held Qiao Nian’s hand. Her hand was soft and tender. He couldn’t help but pull it to his lips and kiss the back of her hand gently. “I’ll listen to you.”

Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. After comforting Gu Zhou, she prepared to sleep. She had just closed her eyes when Gu Zhou’s doting voice rang in her ears.

“Mrs. Gu, do you have any other aliases?”

Qiao Nian’s sleepiness instantly dissipated. This man really liked to get to the bottom of things!

She wondered if the chairman of the Nanshan Group was considered an alias.

If she told Gu Zhou about this now, Gu Zhou would definitely eat her up again and again without hesitation. After all, Nanshan Corporation had also earned a lot of money from him!

With that, Qiao Nian lay motionless in Gu Zhou’s arms.

…

Jiang Chi sat alone in his room. The phone screen was lit up, and it was Jiang Cheng’s smiling face.

His fingers gently caressed Jiang Cheng’s face. In a daze, he seemed to see Jiang Cheng running towards him with a smile.

However, in the next moment, the lifeless face of Jiang Cheng in the ice coffin appeared in Jiang Chi’s mind. He frowned, his expression darkening.

He would definitely make that person pay with his life for messing with his brother!

If he couldn’t find any news from Mr. Chen, how could he find out the truth about his brother’s death?

Jiang Chi also understood that if he could investigate the kidnapping of the eldest daughter of the Lu family 20 years ago, he would know who killed his brother.

However, so much time had passed since the kidnapping of the eldest daughter of the Lu family more than twenty years ago. Moreover, the Lu family had yet to investigate the truth. His power in An City was far inferior to the Lu family. How should he investigate all of this?
