1533 Polite Conversation

Shen Mei had never expected her head to lighten. Even her vision had improved. She was a little surprised by the change in her.

“Okay!” Shen Mei agreed readily.

Qiao Nian thought of Shen Mei’s expression just now. She felt that Shen Mei’s mental age should be very young. She looked as innocent as a child.

While Qiao Nian was deep in thought, Shen Mei put on her clothes. She opened the bed and put on her slippers. She looked at Qiao Nian and said gently, “I want some water.”

Qiao Nian helped Shen Mei to the table and sat down. She poured Shen Mei a glass of water and handed it to her. Smiling, she said, “Here.”

“Thank… thank you.” Holding the teacup with both hands, Shen Mei drank the water slowly.

Qiao Nian smiled at Shen Mei and asked curiously, “Are you very afraid of needles?”

Shen Mei’s hands trembled slightly, and she almost poured the tea out of the teacup.

Shen Mei was innocent. Everything was written on her face. Qiao Nian said, “The president just went to get your medical records. I can only formulate a recovery plan for you after seeing what medicine you’ve taken. He’s already agreed to let me be your attending doctor.”

Qiao Nian paused for a moment and continued, “I want to ask how you feel. That way, we can get twice the results with half the effort during the treatment.”

When Shen Mei heard Qiao Nian’s words, she heaved a sigh of relief. Thinking of the needles in the past, she frowned slightly and said, “It hurts. It hurts very much.”

“Did you get injections often?” Qiao Nian asked softly.

Shen Mei blinked and nodded. “Yes.”

Qiao Nian didn’t understand if the needles Shen Mei were afraid of were the ones she usually needed for an IV drip, or if they were the ones used to operate on her face.

Suddenly, footsteps came from not far away. The footsteps were getting closer and closer, and Qiao Nian didn’t have time to ask further, so she smiled and said, “Since you don’t like needles, I’ll try not to use them in front of you. I won’t mention this again, lest it affects your mood. Only by maintaining a good mood can you recover faster.”

Shen Mei looked at Qiao Nian’s smiling face and couldn’t help but laugh.

At this moment, the door opened.

The president walked in. He didn’t expect Shen Mei to be awake. His eyes were filled with joy as he asked happily, “You’re awake. How do you feel?”

Qiao Nian looked into the President’s eyes, which were filled with joy as he looked at Shen Mei.

“Yes, I’m much better.” Shen Mei looked at the president and enunciated each word clearly. “My… head feels lighter!”

The president’s lips curved up involuntarily. In the past, Shen Mei had always said that her head hurt so much that she was between life and death. This was the first time he had heard her say that her head was lighter. He gently ruffled Shen Mei’s hair and said, “Alright, that’s good. What did you do just now?”

The smile in the President’s eyes dissipated a little. A trace of vigilance flashed in his eyes, but he quickly regained his composure. He smiled gently at Shen Mei and said, “Then what did you talk about?”

Qiao Nian sat there without changing her expression, but her heart was already in a mess.

She wondered if Madam President would tell her about their conversation. She was worried that the president would find traces of their conversation. That would expose her.

Shen Mei’s eyes flickered. After some thought, she said seriously, “Treating my illness!”

When Qiao Nian heard Shen Mei’s words, the uneasiness in her heart instantly disappeared.

Out of the corner of his eye, the president glanced at Qiao Nian. Seeing that Qiao Nian still had a faint smile on her face, he looked at Shen Mei gently, as if he was happy with Shen Mei’s improvement.

The President’s doubts gradually dissipated. He tucked Shen Mei’s hair behind her ear and said softly, “Yes, with Doctor Qiao around, you’ll definitely recover.”

Shen Mei smiled quietly and nodded obediently. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Seeing Shen Mei like this, the President’s heart softened.
