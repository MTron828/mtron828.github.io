Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Gu Zhou was clearly in a bad mood.

However, she really wanted to know why Gu Zhou was unhappy.

Was it because he felt that his male dignity had been damaged, or was it because Gu Zhou was already starting to care about her?

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but recall Gu Zhou standing on the tank.

At that time, Gu Zhou had looked at her very seriously. His eyes were deep. When she met his eyes, she would be sucked in if she wasn’t careful. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

When the car stopped, Qiao Nian slowly opened her eyes. It was already two in the morning.

She unbuckled her seatbelt and placed her hand on the door handle. Just as she was about to get out of the car, she seemed to have thought of something. Her gaze landed on Gu Zhou, who was unbuckling his seatbelt. She called out softly, “Gu Zhou.”

Qiao Nian’s voice was as gentle and pleasant as ever, but Gu Zhou could hear her confusion in her words.

Gu Zhou unbuckled his seatbelt and looked up at Qiao Nian. “What’s wrong?”

Qiao Nian’s heart couldn’t help but race. She pursed her lips slightly and asked, “This time, you came specially to pick me up, right?”

Just like how he had specially come to pick her up when he was standing on the tank.

“Yeah.”

Qiao Nian’s lips curved up slightly, and the uneasiness in her heart gradually disappeared. Her gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face.

She recalled that Gu Zhou had minded her meeting Lu Zhu very much previously. She explained seriously again, “I really have nothing to do with Brother Lu. I treat him like an elder brother!”

Seeing that Gu Zhou’s expression didn’t change, Qiao Nian thought that he hadn’t heard her. She said confidently, “Moreover, I don’t have any improper thoughts.”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, the dark clouds that had been swirling around his heart dissipated a little. “Yes.”

Qiao Nian noticed that the coldness around Gu Zhou had lessened. She asked hesitantly, “Has something been bothering you recently?”

“Huh?”

“I think you’re a little different from before,” Qiao Nian said hesitantly, looking at Gu Zhou.

Although Gu Zhou had come to pick her up in the past, this feeling was still different.

Gu Zhou’s phoenix-like eyes narrowed slightly, and his sexy lips curved up slightly. He asked, “Huh?”

“I just have this feeling.” Qiao Nian frowned slightly, but she just felt that Gu Zhou was different from before.

The man’s eyes darkened as he asked, “Because I took the initiative to pick you up today?”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she looked up at him, then lowered her head, frowning again.

It didn’t seem to be just because Gu Zhou had come to pick her up.

Could it be because Gu Zhou was worried that she would be with Lu Zhu?

Seeing that Qiao Nian had remained silent, Gu Zhou stared at her unblinkingly with his dark eyes. For some reason, he recalled the name Qiao Nian had called that night.

Gu Chuan…

Gu Zhou felt his breathing quicken. His voice was low, hoarse, and domineering. “I’m just bringing my wife home. Isn’t that only right?”

Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat.

Gu Zhou’s words seemed to have been repeated a million times. It was especially natural. Coupled with his hoarse and sexy voice, her heart raced.

The temperature in the car gradually rose.

Qiao Nian looked into Gu Zhou’s eyes. Her face was reflected in his eyes.

She quickly looked away, worried that she would say something rude. “There’s no one else here.”

Her original intention was that now that there was no one else around and Gu Zhou no longer had to continue pretending.

However, she suddenly sensed that Gu Zhou’s expression was a little dark. She thought that she had said something wrong again and made Gu Zhou angry. She hurriedly said, “It can’t be that you like me!”

With that, Qiao Nian met Gu Zhou’s bottomless eyes. She had a bad feeling.

What nonsense was she spouting?

Could Gu Zhou like her?

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian hurriedly got out of the car. Breathing in the fresh air, she felt much better. She looked at Gu Zhou, who had also gotten out of the car, and hurriedly explained, “I was just…”

“It’s only right for me to like my wife.”

Qiao Nian felt as if she had been struck by lightning. She stood rooted to the ground in a daze, looking at Gu Zhou in disbelief.

Had she heard wrongly?

How could Gu Zhou like her?
