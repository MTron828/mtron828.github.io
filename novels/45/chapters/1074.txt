1075 Lying

Qiao Nian’s man was rich and powerful. He would definitely mind about what had happened to Qiao Nian before. If he told the truth, Qiao Nian might have to divorce this man!

As long as Qiao Nian wasn’t with this terrifying man, it was up to him how he wanted to bully her later!

However, what if this man crippled him first because he was angry?

After much hesitation, Shen Hao came up with a beautiful lie. Not only could this lie enable Qiao Nian to be with this man, but he also didn’t have to worry that this man would cripple him. It was simply the best of both worlds. Unfortunately, he couldn’t bully Qiao Nian anymore!

Shen Hao pursed his lips and said, “Actually, that incident was just a misunderstanding. At that time, Nian Nian was doing her homework at home, so I gave her a cup of water. Then, my wife misunderstood. What can I have to do with Nian Nian? I’m her uncle!”

Gu Zhou looked at Shen Hao sharply. He retracted his gaze indifferently. When he looked at Qiao Nian, his eyes were much gentler, and there was a hint of doting in his voice. “Nian’er?”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou and shrugged slightly. “No, he’s lying!”

When Shen Hao heard Qiao Nian’s words, his expression changed!

Was Qiao Nian, this wretched girl, stupid?

How could she tell the truth at a time like this?

Wasn’t Qiao Nian afraid that her man would dump her?

Gu Zhou’s expression darkened. He looked at Shen Hao again, his gaze as sharp as a knife. He questioned word by word, “Are you lying?”

Although it was a question, Gu Zhou’s tone was very certain.

Shen Hao was so anxious that cold sweat broke out on his forehead. He didn’t know what to say either. He stammered for a long time, but he couldn’t say a word!

Gu Zhou looked at Shen Hao with a dark expression. Like the god of death from hell, he kicked Shen Hao hard in the groin!

When Xu Qiu said that Qiao Nian had seduced Shen Hao, Gu Zhou already understood what Shen Hao wanted to do.

If he had been by Qiao Nian’s side in the past, he would never have let her suffer like this!

Although he had avenged Qiao Nian now, it was many years too late!

Shen Hao covered his lower body with both hands. It was so painful that tears welled up in his eyes. He rolled on the ground!

Xu Qiu’s mouth was agape. She looked at Shen Hao worriedly and asked vaguely, “Hubby, Hubby, are you alright? Don’t scare me!”

Shen Hao was in so much pain that he could not speak. He lay on the ground, looking as if he was struggling at death’s door!

Seeing Shen Hao like this, Xu Qiu’s heart ached so much that tears welled up in her eyes. Her husband was so kind and had even helped raise Qiao Nian. Even now, Qiao Nian, this wretched girl, was still lying!

If it weren’t for Qiao Nian, how could her husband have suffered like this?

If her husband became impotent in the future, her life would be insecure for the rest of her life!

Xu Qiu’s eyes were red with anger. He glared fiercely at Gu Zhou and cursed, “You damned man! How dare you touch my husband? If you dare, let me go and let’s fight one-on-one!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Xu Qiu weighed more than 100 kilograms. When she was angry, she looked fierce!

Her mouth was filled with blood, giving off a ferocious feeling, as if she was a demon from hell!

Xu Qiu struggled hard twice, but the two bodyguards were holding on too tightly. She scolded angrily, “Qiao Nian, you ingrate. I raised you painstakingly, but you actually repaid kindness with ingratitude. Are you f*cking inhumane?!”

Xu Qiu’s front teeth had already been knocked out. Her words were so sharp that one couldn’t hear what she was saying. No one cared what she was saying.

Gu Zhou looked at Shen Hao, who was lying on the ground. “Since you can’t control the thing in your pants, why don’t you just cut it off to prevent future trouble?”

Shen Hao shivered in fear. Silently, he moved back and swallowed. Suppressing the pain, he asked, “Qiao Nian used to be with other men. Aren’t you angry?”

After Xu Qiu heard Shen Hao’s words, she stood rooted to the ground in a daze. The lower half of her face was badly mangled, and her eyes couldn’t help but turn red!
