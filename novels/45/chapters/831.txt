832 Doubts

Everyone in the Lu family was very concerned about the eldest daughter of the Lu family. Back then, when the eldest daughter of the Lu family was kidnapped, none of the Lu family members ate or drank. They were all dejected because of her.

Due to the kidnapping of the eldest daughter of the Lu family, Mrs. Lu almost suffered from depression. She did not dare to stay in the country, afraid that she would think of the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

Logically speaking, there shouldn’t be any problems with the DNA test Mrs. Lu had personally done for the broken arm.

Could it be that there was something wrong with the detector at that time?

Gu Zhou was puzzled.

“Back then, my mother was afraid that there would be a mistake in the test results, so she found ten different instruments to test two samples. At the same time, she did dozens of tests.”

Lu Zhu sighed heavily. Thinking of Mrs. Lu, he said sadly, “She didn’t look like she was lying back then. I don’t know what’s wrong with her either. You should know that my mother’s mental state isn’t good now. She still thinks of Sugar occasionally. She still thinks that Sugar is still alive! We didn’t dare to tell the truth, afraid that it would aggravate her condition.”

“Yes!” Gu Zhou sighed heavily.

When Sugar’s accident happened, the Gu family had also gone to help. He knew a little about the situation back then.

At that time, Mrs. Lu was in a daze and did not look like she was lying.

Lu Zhu recalled the question Gu Zhou had asked him previously. He sighed heavily and said, “Back then, things weren’t that simple. When we caught the three kidnappers, they quickly admitted that they had kidnapped the eldest daughter of the Lu family and killed her. Therefore, the verdict for the case at that time was very fast.”

Thinking of what had happened more than twenty years ago, Lu Zhu closed his eyes heavily. “If they didn’t admit that they killed Sugar, the three of them wouldn’t have needed to be sentenced to death, so we never thought that they would lie.”

“But Nian’er is still alive!” Gu Zhou’s eyes grew darker and darker, as if there was a layer of mist in them that could not be dispelled.

“This means that someone made the three of them become scapegoats. They’re also willing to be scapegoats.” Lu Zhu’s expression became more and more serious. He pursed his lips tightly and said, “Now that we don’t know who the people behind this are, I’m worried that Sugar will be threatened again, so I don’t want her to return now.”

“I understand. Even if Nian’er’s identity is exposed, you don’t have to worry. I’ll do my best to protect her. I won’t let her be hurt again!” Gu Zhou’s voice deepened, but his tone was exceptionally firm.

When Lu Zhu heard Gu Zhou’s words, his expression relaxed a little. He said, “I’m relieved to hear that. I believe you can protect her well. No matter what, I hope you can put Sugar’s safety first!”

“Yeah.”

Gu Zhou had just hung up when Chen Qing knocked on his office door.

“Second Young Master, it’s me, Chen Qing.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Come in!” Gu Zhou was slightly stunned. Then, he frowned and his expression turned serious.

It was still early. Logically speaking, Chen Qing should be resting.

However, since Chen Qing had come to look for him, it meant that something serious had happened.

“What happened?” Gu Zhou asked warily when Chen Qing entered.

“Second Young Master, the administrator of the Dongjiang villa said today that there seems to be someone living in the villa. Could it be that a thief has gone to the villa?” Chen Qing frowned and voiced his guess.

“When did this happen?”

“He just called this morning. Two days ago, the villa manager thought he had seen wrongly. This morning, he even realized that the lights in the villa were on.”

Chen Qing was also woken up by the administrator’s call. He paused for a moment and continued, “Even if there’s no one living in the Dongjiang villa or if it’s really a thief, I’m thinking about how Young Master lived there previously. Will anyone with ulterior motives find out about Young Master?”

As Chen Qing spoke, he kept looking carefully at Gu Zhou’s face, afraid that Gu Zhou would fly into a rage. However, Gu Zhou kept his head lowered, so he couldn’t see the emotions in his eyes.
