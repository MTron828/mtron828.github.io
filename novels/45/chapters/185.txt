Chapter 186 Breaking the Law

“Ahem.” Qiu Nan coughed awkwardly.

Su Xue said girlishly, “It’s true. I felt my heart flutter the moment I saw you. Can you come shopping with me?”

There was silence on Qiu Nan’s end.

Su Xue continued to seduce him. “I really feel so lonely. I’ll only feel happy when you’re by my side. Come over and accompany me, okay?”

Qiu Nan himself was also a lustful person. It would be a pity to decline a woman who had delivered herself to his doorstep. “Sister Xue, in that case, send me the location!”

“Okay, I love you!”

The recording ended abruptly. Qiao Nian didn’t need to say anything else. Everyone knew what happened next.

Su Xue’s face had turned pale with fear. She lowered her head, not daring to look at Qiao Shan’s face.

She had never expected Qiao Nian to have a recording of their conversation from a year ago.

Now, it was clear that Qiao Nian had long wanted to deal with her.

At the thought of this, Su Xue felt a chill run down her spine. Qiao Nian was truly a terrifying person.

Qiao Xin, who was standing at the side, was completely stunned. She looked at her mother in shock. Her mother was usually kind and gentle, and had always devoted herself diligently to the family. How could she do such a thing behind their backs?

If her mother had found a man who was more outstanding than her father, Qiao Xin felt that she could perhaps understand. After all, it was natural for every woman to want to find a better man.

But what about this Qiu Nan?

Qiu Nan was just a fitness instructor who relied on his figure and face to make a living. Such a man was not even worthy of being her father’s shoeshiner. How could her mother lower herself to be with such a man?

Qiao Xin’s face turned red with anger. She questioned, “Mom, are you blind? How can you be with such a man? He’s not even fit to be Dad’s shoeshiner!”

Su Xue’s body swayed. At this moment, she had lost all her dignity. She could no longer face her daughter.

Qiao Nian stood at the side, adding fuel to the fire. “It takes two to tango. Su Xue, you were the one who first started. Even if Qiu Nan has to go to jail, you should be the one sitting in there with him. You’re the main culprit, and he’s the accessory. However, seeing how much you like him, I can get someone to smooth things over and let the two of you stay in the same cell. That will allow the two of you to continue interacting and improving your relationship.”

Continue interacting?

Were they to continue having sexual interactions?

Qiao Shan clenched his fists tightly. In an instant, he lost all rationality. He stepped forward and grabbed Su Xue’s hair. Gritting his teeth, he slapped Su Xue a few more times.

Qiao Shan only stopped when Su Xue’s nose began to bleed. Su Xue’s face was as swollen as a pig’s head. She raised a hand to wipe the blood from her nose, glaring at Qiao Nian with hatred in her eyes. She cursed angrily, “Qiao Nian, you set me up. You’ll die a horrible death, never to be reincarnated!”

When Gu Zhou heard the last sentence, he frowned. “Chen Qing.”

Chen Qing had long disliked Su Xue. When he heard Gu Zhou calling him, he swiftly rolled up his sleeves and walked towards Su Xue.

Now, it was finally his turn to show off his skills!

With just one slap, Chen Qing had broken the skin on Su Xue’s face, causing her to stumble and fall onto the bed.

“Qiao Nian is my legal wife. Scolding her is equivalent to insulting me. I’ll make sure you remember this slap to the face. You’re not worthy.” Gu Zhou’s voice wasn’t loud, but it was soul-stirring. With that, he turned to look at Chen Qing. “Where are the police now?”

Upon hearing this, Su Xue and Qiu Nan were both shocked. Their bodies trembled.

Qiao Shan and Qiao Xin were also stunned.

Chen Qing took in their reactions and said calmly, “They should be here soon!”

Su Xue’s lips trembled in fear. Puzzled, she asked, “What… What do you mean?”

Qiao Nian answered Su Xue’s question in a kindly manner. “You’ve already committed the crime of adultery under the matrimonial law. According to the law, you should be detained for a month.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Su Xue felt as if she had been struck by lightning. Her heart stuttered, and she took a moment to react.

Detention.

If she was detained, she would forever be labeled as an adulteress. She would be looked down upon by everyone in high society.
