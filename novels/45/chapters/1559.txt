Chapter 1560 Poisoned

All their attention was on the black blood on the ground. The large pool of black blood looked terrifying!

Holding a flashlight, Qiao Nian walked over quickly. Her expression changed drastically. The two of them looked abnormal. Their faces were pale, their lips were purple, and their breathing was irregular.

Qiao Nian noticed the abnormality around Lina's waist. She pursed her lips and looked at the mercenary leader solemnly. "They must have been bitten by a snake. Did you bring antivenom?"

Every time a mercenary went on a mission, he would bring a first-aid kit. Usually, there was antivenom in the first-aid kit.

"I still need medicine for external injuries." Qiao Nian wanted to list out the names of the medicine one by one, but the situation was urgent now. She said, "Bring the medicine bag over!"

The mercenary leader knew that Qiao Nian was a doctor. Hearing Qiao Nian's words, he took out his walkie-talkie without hesitation. "Bring the medicine box in."

After turning off the walkie-talkie, the mercenary leader looked at Qiao Nian and asked nervously, "Miss Qiao, the Seventh Princess is now…"

Qiao Nian carefully observed Chen Qing and Lina's condition. She opened their eyelids and saw that Chen Qing's pupils had already dilated. It seemed that Chen Qing's condition was much worse than Lina's.

"Lina's waist and ankles have been bitten. The injuries to her ankles aren't serious, but the condition of her waist is more serious. Fortunately, the first-aid measures were done well." Qiao Nian frowned and continued, "Chen Qing must have been infected with the poison when he helped Lina suck it out. As long as we inject the antivenom as soon as possible, Lina will slowly recover."

Qiao Nian paused for a moment and continued, "Chen Qing's condition is a little serious."

Gu Zhou frowned, his dark pupils constricting slightly. His gaze fell on Chen Qing's face.

The mercenary leader looked at Chen Qing and said, "Mr. Chen Qing is the warrior who saved our Seventh Princess!"

At this moment, the mercenary leader's walkie-talkie rang. The mercenary's words came through in English. The message was that the medicine box had been brought over.

The mercenary walked out and brought in the medicine box.

Qiao Nian placed Lina and Chen Qing steadily on the ground. Her gaze fell on the mercenary leader and Gu Zhou. "I need peace and quiet from now on. All of you, go to the door and wait."

Gu Zhou's gaze moved from Chen Qing's face to Qiao Nian's. Looking at Qiao Nian's pale face and serious expression, he pursed his lips slightly.

"Alright, but raise the firewood first." As Gu Zhou spoke, he glanced at the mercenary leader.

The cave was cold and the temperature was very low.

The mercenary leader hurriedly got someone to gather the firewood and enter.

The firewood in the cave burned, and the entire cave instantly warmed up. This series of actions did not take more than twenty seconds.

Gu Zhou and the mercenary walked out.

Qiao Nian looked at Lina and Chen Qing in front of her and began to inject the two of them with antivenom, followed by silver needles.

Lina's life was not in danger. If she could not get rid of the snake poison in her body, her body would probably face abnormalities in the future.

Chen Qing was in even more danger.

Qiao Nian's eyes hardened. She had to save these two people. She could not let anything happen to them.

…

An hour later, four cars silently drove into the palace on a rainy night.

The president had long received the news from the mercenary leader. He had been pacing back and forth in the conference room.

This time, Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian found Colorful Fungus on Cliff Mountain that could save Madam's life.

Not only that, but Qiao Nian also saved Lina and Chen Qing, who had been poisoned by snake venom.

Qiao Nian helped Lina and Chen Qing control their situations and injected them with antivenom. As soon as they arrived at the palace, Lina and Chen Qing were brought to the medical room by Professor Ollie's team.

Qiao Nian handed a flower pot to the president, who took it with trembling hands.

This was Colorful Fungus!

This was really Colorful Fungus!

The president's eyes were a little red. He looked up at Qiao Nian, his eyes filled with gratitude.

In the past, he suspected that Qiao Nian had ulterior motives, but now, he was only grateful to her.

Qiao Nian had saved Lina's life again and again. Not only that, she might be able to completely treat Madam's illness in the future.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m
