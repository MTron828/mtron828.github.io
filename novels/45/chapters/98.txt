Chapter 99: Taking the Oath

Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

“Second Brother, I didn’t harm Grandma!” Jiang Yue looked toward Gu Zhou pleadingly, as if she hoped that Gu Zhou would stand up for her. “Everything I’ve done has been for Grandma’s sake.”

Gu Zhou merely stood there in silence, his entire body radiating a cold aura.

“Second Brother, Grandma raised me since I was young. How could I be so ungrateful?” Jiang Yue looked at Gu Zhou anxiously, tears trickling down her face. She looked extremely pitiful. Those who didn’t know better would think that someone had bullied her.

“Since you didn’t do anything to let Grandma down, then take the oath!” Qiao Nianfeng said lightly. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Second Sister-in-law, how can you say that?” Jiang Yue questioned tearfully. “My parents were already in great pain when they were alive. Why do you still want to disrupt their souls?”

“Since you said that you didn’t do this, then even if you were to swear on their souls, you wouldn’t be disturbing them, would you?” Qiao Nian said carelessly. She glared coldly at Jiang Yue, her gaze like a venomous snake.

Jiang Yue’s scalp began to go numb under Qiao Nian’s glare. She shook her head and said stubbornly, “I didn’t do it. I didn’t harm Grandma!”

“Then swear on it!” Qiao Nian said relentlessly, reminding Jiang Yue of her words once again.

Jiang Yue clenched her fists tightly, tears falling from her eyes. After a long while, she said with red-rimmed eyes, “If I’m the one who made Grandma fall ill, then my parents will never be able to reincarnate. They will never, ever be happy.”

After taking the oath, Jiang Yue started to cry even more pitifully.

‘When Qiao Nian heard Jiang Yue’s words, a faint smile appeared on her face. “Since you’ve already sworn on it, I’ll believe you for the time being.”

Jiang Yue wiped her tears and asked pitifully, “Second Sister-in-law, why are you targeting me?”

“Miss Jiang, are you sure that statement is entirely accurate?” Qiao Nian asked.

Jiang Yue looked at Qiao Nian strangely, not understanding what she had said wrong.

“Out of everyone in the Gu family, you’ve always been the one targeting me, haven’t you?” Qiao Nian asked, looking at Jiang Yue.

Jiang Yue froze for a moment. Indeed, she seemed to be the only one who had suspected Qiao Nian just now. She had been too anxious just now.

Qiao Nian looked at Jiang Yue thoughtfully, then turned to look at Gu Zhou and said, “T’ll go prepare some herbal cuisine for Grandma.”

With that, Qiao Nian left without looking back.

Jiang Yue watched as Qiao Nian left. For some reason, she had a bad feeling about this.

“Jiang Yue.”

Gu Zhou’s voice rang out from the side. Jiang Yue turned to look at Gu Zhou.

“Do you still remember how your parents died?” Standing where he was, Gu Zhou asked coldly.

Jiang Yue looked at Gu Zhou. She understood what Gu Zhou meant. Gu Zhou was still suspicious of her.

Back then, their family of three had been kidnapped. In order to protect her, his father and mother had been tortured to death by the kidnappers.

When the police arrived, she had been shielded by her parents, who had bracketed her on both sides. It was because of this that she managed to survive the ordeal. However, her parents had already been beaten black and blue.

Jiang Yue could still remember her parents’ groans of pains when they were tortured. Even now, she often dreamed of her parents being tortured in the hands of the kidnappers.

“Second Brother, I’ve had nothing to do with any of this. A clear conscience is not afraid of slander.” Forcibly maintaining her composure, Jiang Yue spoke, enunciating each word.

Gu Zhou gave Jiang Yue a meaningful look, then left.

Jiang Yue was drenched in cold sweat. Seeing Gu Zhou leave, her legs gave way, and she collapsed to the ground, sobbing.

The two servants, who had been guarding Matriarch Gu’s room, looked down at Jiang Yue and pretended not to see anything.

Jiang Yue cried hysterically, as if she had suffered a tremendous grievance.

Jiang Yue sobbed until she passed out..
