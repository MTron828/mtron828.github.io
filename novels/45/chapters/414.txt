Chapter 415: Control Her?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian was slightly taken aback.

Lu Zhu was actually controlling her.

There was nothing wrong with wearing ordinary clothes and wearing simple makeup, but why couldn’t she smile?

What surprised Qiao Nian the most was that Lu Zhu, who usually disliked her the most, would actually say such things.

Moreover, Gu Zhou had never said such things to her.

Thinking about it carefully, this sounded like a brother lecturing his sister to protect her.

A trace of confusion flashed across Qiao Nian’s eyes.

Lu Zhu also knew that he had said too much. However, what he had said was like water that had been splashed out. There was no way to take it back.

He looked at the people coming and going in the hall in front of him and said, “Let’s go!”

Qiao Nian nodded slightly.

When Qiao Nian walked into the hall, she instantly received all sorts of gazes from all directions.

Those who could come here were either rich or noble. Most of them were well-known people, and some were people who had received invitations.

However, to Qiao Nian’s surprise, Qiao Xin wasn’t around.

As usual, Qiao Yu was wearing a dark suit and looked old-fashioned. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

It was such an old style, but on Qiao Yu, it did not look tacky at all. Instead, he gave off an unapproachable feeling.

In addition, Qiao Yu’s handsome face instantly attracted the attention of many socialites. Some of them boldly walked over to talk to him, hoping to get his contact information.

However, Qiao Yu rejected all of them expressionlessly.

At this moment, Qiao Yu also noticed that Qiao Nian had entered.

When Qiao Yu saw that Qiao Nian was wearing a rose-colored dress, his frown deepened, and he did not hide the displeasure on his face.

Qiao Yu walked up to Qiao Nian and said coldly, “Why didn’t you take what I said yesterday to heart?”

Qiao Nian looked at Qiao Yu fearlessly. Her red lips curled up slightly as she said, “I’ve already said it yesterday. With Mr. Lu around, I’ll be fine.”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Qiao Yu’s frown deepened. He took a step forward and looked at Qiao Nian coldly, a hint of impatience in his tone. “Qiao Nian, don’t go too far!”

Qiao Nian smiled brightly and asked, “Are you helping Gu Zhou remind me?”

Yesterday, Qiao Yu had noticed that Mr. Chen looked at Qiao Nian differently!

Moreover, he had already reminded Qiao Nian, but he had never expected that Qiao Nian would specially put on makeup today. She was wearing a red dress, and was simply the most beautiful person present!

Qiao Yu took a step back and said coldly, “Qiao…”

Lu Zhu frowned and interrupted Qiao Yu. “Mr. Qiao, please pay attention to the occasion! You’ve attracted the attention of many people!”

Qiao Yu closed his eyes slightly and stood rooted to the ground coldly. When he opened them again, his gaze was fixed on Qiao Nian’s face.

“Oh my god, that girl in the red dress is really beautiful! There are two handsome men surrounding her. She’s so lucky!”

“She’s really beautiful!”

“So Qiao Yu likes girls like that. I understand now!”

“I’ve never heard her name before. It seems she doesn’t have much of a background!”

“Could she be a wild model like Ah Miao?”

… .

In the eyes of these people, a wild model was just a prostitute.

The men looked at Qiao Nian’s face and listened to what the others were saying. They were already certain that Qiao Nian was a model.

“Even if she’s a wild model, she’s still a top-notch one!”

“There’s sweetness in her charm!”

“I wonder how she will feel in bed!”

“She must have served Mr. Lu and Mr. Qiao before. I think her skills can’t be bad!”

“Even if you die for love, it’s still a worthwhile love affair! If I can get close to her, I can die without regrets!”
