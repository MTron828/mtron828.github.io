1464 Testing the Medicine Personally

Hearing the assistant’s words, the anger on Wright’s face dissipated a little. He pursed his lips slightly and asked hesitantly, “Will your life not be in danger for the next twenty-four hours?” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The assistant nodded affirmatively and said, “Yes. The doctor told me that if I take the antidote within 48 hours, it won’t cause any harm to my body, nor will there be any aftereffects. Please rest assured, Prince.”

Wright heaved a sigh of relief and said in satisfaction, “That’s good. Although Lina is missing an arm, it’s good as long as she’s alive. She’s the most useful to us alive. If she dies, she’ll be useless.”

“That’s right, my prince!” The assistant hurriedly curried favor with him.

Wright picked up the binoculars again, keeping an eye on the two men in the hospital garden.

…

Qiao Nian held the test tube carefully. The test tube contained the residual poison extracted from the arrowhead. She walked up to the centrifuge and began to centrifuge the sample.

After Qiao Nian set the time for the centrifuge, she glanced at the distillation system not far away. Her eyes gradually turned serious.

She walked to the other side of the experiment table and began to test the acidity of the poison.

As time was tight, Qiao Nian needed to do several experiments at the same time to confirm what the residual poison in the arrowhead was. A pile of things was written densely on the notebook at the side.

Although this was an advanced laboratory, many basic chemical composition tests still needed to be done manually. However, there were also a few tests that could be directly measured with precise instruments.

By the time Qiao Nian had completely concocted the antidote, five hours had passed!

Although the antidote had been made, she didn’t dare to give it to Lina directly now, because she wasn’t sure if this antidote was useful.

Qiao Nian was now conducting a computer simulation experiment. The computer showed that the simulation experiment had succeeded.

There were no white mice in the laboratory now, so she couldn’t experiment on them.

Qiao Nian’s eyes gradually darkened. She looked at the poison not far away. Now, she could only try the antidote on herself.

Qiao Nian drank the poison first. Her entire body ached, as if a hammer shattered every bone in her body.

Qiao Nian was in so much pain that her forehead was covered in cold sweat. She pretended to be calm. Trembling, she took the antidote from the side and drank it.

Qiao Nian pressed her hands against the experiment table and tried hard to support her body. She watched as time passed bit by bit on her phone, and the pain in her body intensified.

About five minutes later, the pain in her body gradually lessened. Only then did Qiao Nian stand up straight and heave a sigh of relief.

This antidote should work!

…

At this moment, Dr. Ollie stood uneasily at the laboratory door, looking conflicted. There was half an hour to ten hours. He looked at the closed laboratory door and sighed sadly.

It seemed that Madam Gu had failed!

With this thought in mind, Dr. Ollie turned around and was about to return to the ward when the laboratory door opened.

Qiao Nian walked out with a cup of medicine.

The beaker was filled with dark brown liquid, and it was still steaming. It was obvious that it had just been made.

Dr. Ollie glanced at the beaker and frowned. Puzzled, he asked, “Is this Chinese medicine?”

Qiao Nian’s face was pale, and her lips were dry. She looked at Dr. Ollie and said, “This is Lina’s antidote!”

Dr. Ollie didn’t say anything. Smelling the Chinese medicine, his expression changed slightly. “Can this really be drunk?”

“The antidote is 100% effective!” After saying this, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but cough twice. She walked towards Lina’s ward.

Dr. Ollie looked at Qiao Nian’s back with a serious expression. He glanced at the time on his wrist again. There was still half an hour left. He just didn’t know if this antidote would work.

Dr. Ollie recalled Qiao Nian’s acupuncture skills and decided to believe her.

He trusted Qiao Nian, but his rationality told him that it was impossible for Qiao Nian to make the antidote in ten hours.

If the antidote could be made so easily, the other party wouldn’t have used this poison!
