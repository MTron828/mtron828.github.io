971 Lying

The Qiao family was far inferior to the Lu family. They were not qualified to be compared to the Lu family at all.

Su Xue hesitated for a moment before saying, “I’ll buy another meal!”

Qiao Shan did not speak. He turned to look out of the window.

Su Xue walked hesitantly to the door. As if she had thought of something, she turned to look at Qiao Shan and asked seriously, “Are you asking Qiao Xin to apologize to Qiao Nian because you hate Qiao Xin?”

Qiao Shan was slightly stunned, and a trace of panic flashed in his eyes. However, he was still someone who had been in the business world for a long time. He quickly regained his composure and asked, “Is that what you think of me?”

Su Xue felt inexplicably guilty.

Qiao Shan sat there calmly and said, “At that time, I was already prepared to let Qiao Xin break my legs.”

Su Xue’s pupils instantly dilated. She looked at Qiao Shan in disbelief, her hand trembling slightly.

“Qiao Xin is my daughter and my pride. How can I bear to let her be crippled for the rest of her life?” Qiao Shan spoke the truth. It was true that he was bitterly disappointed in Qiao Xin, but he was worried that Su Xue’s heart would ache for Qiao Xin. If she angered Lu Zhu, Qiao Yu would be hurt.

“It’s true that my heart aches for Qiao Xin. I’m also indignant about having my leg amputated. I’m not a saint. I’m angry. In addition, Qiao Xin has gone too far. My daughter has done something wrong. Can’t I reprimand her?” Qiao Shan questioned, raising his eyebrows.

When Su Xue heard Qiao Shan’s words, she empathized.

In the past, whenever Qiao Xin did something wrong, she would lecture her. If a child did something wrong, he should be educated.

“I’m sorry, Hubby. I was wrong. I misunderstood you.” As Su Xue spoke, she walked towards Qiao Shan and grabbed his hand. “You’re right. If it were me, I would feel the same way.”

“Ah Xue.”

When Su Xue heard Qiao Shan call her that, her heart instantly skipped a beat. She met Qiao Shan’s serious eyes and felt inexplicably nervous.

“Our son is right. We’ve spoiled Qiao Xin a little too much. That’s why Qiao Xin is so lawless. Now, it’s Qiao Nian who hasn’t called the police. If Qiao Nian did, how many years do you think Qiao Xin will be locked up for?” Qiao Shan held back his temper. For his son’s sake, he had to hold back.

“Hubby, I understand what you mean. Let Qiao Xin remember not to make any more mistakes in the future, right?” After Su Xue spoke, she felt that Qiao Shan’s actions didn’t seem to be wrong.

“I know that Qiao Xin has an arrogant personality. She won’t be able to take it if I ask her to kneel down and apologize to Qiao Nian. Ah Xue, you knelt down and begged Lu Zhu. If it weren’t for the fact that I couldn’t move, I would have knelt down and begged him too, just like how I begged Gu Zhou.”

At this point, Qiao Shan looked a little dejected. He gripped Su Xue’s hand tightly. “But it’s useless. They don’t care about our begging at all. All they want is Qiao Xin’s apology. Children have to experience some things themselves. It’s better to know their mistakes and improve. I think Qiao Xin will become more mature after this. She won’t make any more mistakes in the future.”

Su Xue sat by the bed, her gaze slightly lowered. She didn’t notice Qiao Shan’s scrutinizing gaze. Her mind was filled with Qiao Shan’s words.

After Qiao Xin apologized this time, the Gu and Lu families would let Qiao Xin off the hook. In the future, Qiao Xin would study hard and live overseas. She would never see the Gu and Lu families again.

“I-I’ll try my best to persuade her,” Su Xue replied softly.

“Go buy some food. We’ll get the nurse to clean up this place later.” Qiao Shan slowly let go of Su Xue’s hand and continued, “Call our son later. He didn’t sleep last night, and after what happened today, we don’t know what’s going on at the company.”

“Okay.” This time, Su Xue was much more straightforward.

When Su Xue left the ward, she called Qiao Yu directly.

“Mom.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Qiao Yu’s tired and weak voice came through the phone. Su Xue felt terrible.

… .

Eleven o’clock in the morning.

Qiao Nian lay on the bed, her eyelashes trembling slightly. She slowly opened her eyes, and the dim yellow light warmed the entire room.

She was about to get up when her entire body hurt terribly. It was as if she had been crushed by a truck. She couldn’t help but cry out, “It hurts…”
