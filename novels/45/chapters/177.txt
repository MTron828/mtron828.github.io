Chapter 178 Making a Wish

Gu Zhou was wearing a casual white shirt, and his entire body emitted a languid aura. Coupled with the indifferent expression on his face, he gave off a cool sense of abstinence. The first button of his shirt was opened, and his perfect chest muscles were just discernible. It made one want to tear off his shirt to take a better look.

Qiao Nian’s gaze moved away from the collar of Gu Zhou’s shirt. Casually, she asked, “Have you taken the medicinal bath I prescribed?”

“Yes.”

Gu Zhou nodded, then walked into Qiao Nian’s room, taking a seat on the sofa.

Qiao Nian walked in as well. She sat down not far away from Gu Zhou, deliberately avoiding any physical contact.

Gu Zhou could sense Qiao Nian’s avoidance. His brow furrowed slightly, but it quickly smoothed out. “You saved Matriarch Lu’s life today. The Lu family is very grateful to you. They wanted to ask if you wanted anything?”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she couldn’t help but feel nervous. “How is Matriarch Lu now? What did the doctor say?”

“Lu Qi said that when she pulled Matriarch Lu to the hospital, Matriarch Lu’s headache worsened. She was covered in cold sweat.”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, her brow furrowed deeper and deeper.

“Fortunately, you’ve let Matriarch Lu know in time. The examination was carried out early, so the doctors could take the necessary precautions. Otherwise, the old lady might have died. The doctors have suggested that the old lady be admitted to the hospital.”

Qiao Nian’s tense heart finally settled back down. She heaved a sigh of relief. Fortunately, Matriarch Lu was fine.

Gu Zhou took Qiao Nian’s reaction to heart. With some admiration in his eyes, he asked, “What wish are you going to make?”

“Are you the magic lamp from Aladdin?” Qiao Nian couldn’t help but laugh. Her eyes seemed to sparkle with starlight as she teased, “Will any wish of mine be granted?”

Gu Zhou looked into Qiao Nian’s eyes. At this moment, time seemed to have stopped. He felt that the person sitting in front of him wasn’t Qiao Nian, but a very clever and adorable little fox.

For some reason, his heart skipped a beat.

Gu Zhou retracted his gaze indifferently, turning away from Qiao Nian. Pretending to be unconcerned, he said, “Any realistic wish should be fine.”

“Okay.” Qiao Nian lowered her head slightly, seemingly deep in thought.

For a long time, Gu Zhou didn’t hear any response from Qiao Nian. He turned his head to see Qiao Nian musing deeply, looking like a little fox with her brow furrowed. Gu Zhou raised an eyebrow. “Are you really planning to take up the offer?”

“Why not?” Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion and continued, “If it’s free, why wouldn’t I take it?”

Gu Zhou: “…”

Qiao Nian said with a serious expression, “I saved Matriarch Lu with my years of experience in medicine. She’s granting me a gift. I would be a fool not to want it!”

Gu Zhou: “…”

Gu Zhou had always thought that Qiao Nian was very generous. One had to know that she didn’t even bat an eyelid when she had gifted those priceless medicinal herbs to someone else.

Gu Zhou was now very curious about what gift Qiao Nian would want.

“I’ve thought of something.” Qiao Nian turned to look at Gu Zhou, her eyes bright and her teeth gleaming white. Excitement was written all over her face. “I want an acceptance letter from the music academy. Can the Lu family do that?”

Gu Zhou had thought that Qiao Nian would want some ordinary item or some medicinal herbs. He had never expected her to want an acceptance letter into a school.

After a long while, Gu Zhou asked, “Is that all?”

Qiao Nian could tell from Gu Zhou’s tone that he was looking down on her request. She glared at Gu Zhou and said unhappily, “What do you mean by ‘is that all’? This wish is impressive. You have to know how difficult it is to get into An City’s music academy. Only one in a thousand students were admitted last

year!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The more Qiao Nian spoke, the more excited she became. “The students who graduated from there are all big shots in the music industry. If I can get in, that would be my fortune!”

Qiao Nian loved guqin and the bass guitar the most[1] Those were her favorite instruments. If she could study in the music academy, she would be able to write her own songs and arrange her own music. Wouldn’t that be amazing?

[1] Guqin is a plucked seven-string Chinese musical instrument.
