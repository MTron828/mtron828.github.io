Chapter 1809 - 1809 Danger

Before Gu Zhou could speak, Chang Feng walked over and sat opposite Qiao Nian.

“It was all my idea,” Gu Zhou said calmly.

“You’re still so self-righteous after doing such a dangerous thing?” Chen Sheng frowned.

“I just don’t want you to criticize her.” Gu Zhou’s tone was much gentler.

Seeing that Qiao Nian had drunk the water, Chang Feng smiled and said, “Junior Sister, why did you suddenly come over?”

“Of course I want to take the same flight home with you.” Qiao Nian put down the cup in her hand with a calm expression. “Eldest Senior Brother, didn’t you tell me that you were going to MY previously? Why are you suddenly going to An City?”

“We just thought of it at the last minute.” Chang Feng smiled gently and continued, “To be precise, Grandpa can’t wait to go back. He’s already taken a plane to An City. We were supposed to go to MY to pick Grandpa up.”

Qiao Nian’s eyes lit up. “That’s great. I can see Grandpa again.”

“Why are you still the same as when you were young?” Chang Feng looked at Qiao Nian’s happy expression, as if he had returned to his childhood.

“What else? It’s meaningless to pretend to be mature in front of you, Eldest Senior Brother.” When Qiao Nian said this, she seemed to have thought of something and hurriedly said, “By the way, did you tell Qin Chuan about this?”

“Not yet. Give him a surprise.”

Qiao Nian looked at Chang Feng suspiciously and said with a smile, “If Qin Chuan finds out that Grandpa is back, he’ll definitely be especially happy. Do you still want to surprise him?”

“How can you say that? We were just communicating amicably,” Chang Feng said innocently.

Qiao Nian couldn’t be bothered to argue with Chang Feng anymore. Her gaze landed on her brother.

Big Brother looked at the magazine indifferently. His every move exuded elegance. He was like a perfect masterpiece of God. However, Qiao Nian saw that he was still wearing a mask and asked in confusion, “Big Brother, the truth has already been revealed. Why are you still wearing a mask?”

Although Cui Si knew that Chen Sheng had betrayed him, he definitely did not know that Chen Sheng was Gu Yue, who had died many years ago.

Gu Zhou was originally drinking water. When he heard Qiao Nian’s words, he subconsciously looked at Gu Yue. He saw that he was still sitting there like a mountain with a mask on.

Chen Sheng looked up from the magazine and inadvertently looked at Chen Sheng’s face reflected in the window.

“I’m used to it,” Chen Sheng said calmly.

To Chen Sheng, he had been wearing a mask for so many years. He was already used to hiding himself and had gradually forgotten about Gu Yue.

Now that he was going home, Chen Sheng was a little nervous.

Chen Sheng had raised Xiao Bao for six years. To Xiao Bao, this face was the closest person to him.

Gu Zhou looked at Chen Sheng’s face and seemed to have thought of something. He said coldly, “I’ve already told Grandma that you’re still alive. Dad also knows that you’re still alive. Actually, the family is the same as before. Nothing has changed.”

Although Gu Zhou did not say anything of concern, every word he said hid his concern for his brother.

He felt a little uncomfortable when he remembered that his father had no intention of coming over to send his brother off.

Qiao Nian smiled at her brother and said, “Brother, all these years, in order to protect the Gu family, you’ve been pretending to be another person and living every day as if you’re walking on thin ice. No matter what appearance you want to live with now, we’ll support you. After all, we’re family. This is an indisputable fact. We just have to live together peacefully.”

Chen Sheng lowered his eyes slightly. After a long time, he replied, “Yes.”

Seeing that Chen Sheng was not saying much, Qiao Nian was worried that the atmosphere was a little off. She said, “Eldest Senior Brother, you’ve been in MY for so many years. Are you married?”

When Chang Feng heard Qiao Nian’s question, he shook his head gently. “No.”

“Then Grandpa must be very worried about your marriage.”

“Yes, he often talks about it, but this is nothing. After all, Grandpa might talk about Qin Chuan more for a while. My ears can finally be at peace.” Chang Feng had a smile on his face.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
