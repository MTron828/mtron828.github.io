Chapter 654: How Could It Be You?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Just as the beautiful music was about to end, Su Sheng came back to her senses.

She lowered her gaze shyly, and her lips curved up involuntarily, thinking that she might be with him.

Su Sheng’s gaze inadvertently fell on the man’s hands. The man’s hands were clenched into fists, his knuckles white and his veins bulging.

According to Su Sheng’s professional knowledge, the man seemed to be angry.

Su Sheng frowned slightly. She looked up at the man in front of her. Suppressing the anger in his eyes, the man’s breathing quickened.

Su Sheng was a psychiatrist. She could naturally tell that the man was angry.

The man didn’t just seem to be angry. There was also a trace of fear in his eyes, as if he was afraid of losing something.

Strange, why did this man have this expression?

Did he hate this song very much?

Or had he heard this song before? Had something bad happened?

Su Sheng’s mind was filled with confusion.

At this moment, Su Sheng heard Gu Qing say, “It’s over. Why don’t we go in?”

“Okay.” Su Sheng retracted her gaze. Mr. Dong Hua was her spiritual idol. She had always wanted to meet him.

Even if it was no longer possible between her and Mr. Dong Hua, she was still very curious about the rumored age of Mr. Dong Hua.

Perhaps Mr. Dong Hua was just like what outsiders said. He was a white-haired old man. Only by seeing the coldness and warmth of this world could one compose moving songs.

Su Sheng followed behind Gu Qing and carefully walked into the piano room.

Her heart began to race.

When she walked in, she saw Qiao Nian sitting by the piano. She was stunned, her face pale. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

What was going on?

Could it be that Qiao Nian played the piano?

How was this possible?

If Qiao Nian was really Mr. Dong Hua, then Qiao Nian must have her own limited edition album.

It seemed that Qiao Nian had played the music just now.

At this moment, Qiao Nian seemed to be still immersed in the song from just now. She didn’t even notice that someone had entered.

Su Sheng looked around but did not see any speakers.

It couldn’t be Qiao Nian who had used her phone to play an audio clip, could it?

That was absolutely impossible. The phone volume couldn’t have been turned up so loud.

Su Sheng frowned. If she removed all the impossibilities, the rest might be the truth.

Qiao Nian was Mr. Dong Hua!

“Why is it you?” Su Sheng exclaimed.

Qiao Nian suddenly came back to her senses. Only then did she realize that three people had walked in.

When her gaze fell on Lu Nian’s deep eyes, her heart suddenly skipped a beat.

Second Brother?

Why was Second Brother looking at her like that?

Second Brother’s eyes were filled with anger, as if she had crossed his bottom line.

Did Second Brother not want her to play this piano?

This was also unlikely.

Previously, Second Brother had clearly asked her to use this piano!

Qiao Nian hesitated for a moment, then slowly stood up. Her breathing involuntarily lightened, and she felt a little uneasy.

Su Sheng looked at Qiao Nian and frowned slightly. She had never expected Qiao Nian to be Mr. Dong Hua.

She felt that Qiao Nian was too scheming.

She treated Qiao Nian as her good friend, but Qiao Nian was full of lies. She didn’t treat her sincerely. Instead, she treated her like a clown.

Back then, Qiao Nian had even appeared at Mr. Dong Hua’s concert as Mr. Dong Hua’s female performer. Wasn’t it tiring for her to play two roles alone?

Su Sheng’s hatred for Qiao Nian had reached its peak.

“Miss Qiao, are you Mr. Dong Hua?” Su Sheng asked. She had already checked her surroundings. The piano piece from before was played from the piano in front of Qiao Nian.

However, Su Sheng still refused to give up.

At this moment, Qiao Nian didn’t answer Su Sheng’s question. Her heart was filled with Lu Nian, and her heart was beating faster and faster.

She had never expected Second Brother to be angry with her.

She didn’t know what she had done wrong.

According to her current relationship with Second Brother, Second Brother probably wouldn’t like her either.

Qiao Nian’s frown deepened. She didn’t know what to do either.
