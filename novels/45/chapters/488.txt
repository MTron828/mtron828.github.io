Chapter 489: It Feels Pretty Good!

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian rubbed her eyes and said casually, “What does her disappearance have to do with me?”

Qiao Yu wasn’t surprised by Qiao Nian’s attitude, because Qiao Nian didn’t like Qiao Xin to begin with.

“The night I first came to MY, I talked to her about the argument she had with you. Maybe she sounded a little harsh, but she said she wanted to go back on her own. But I had someone check the plane tickets and didn’t see any record of her buying a ticket. Mom and Dad also said she didn’t come home.”

MY was a dangerous place. With Qiao Xin’s personality, what if something happened to her outside?

Qiao Nian was getting impatient. “This has nothing to do with me. What are you calling me for?”

“Qiao Nian, can you help me look for her?”

When Qiao Nian heard Qiao Yu’s words, she couldn’t help but laugh. She asked, “Qiao Yu, are you out of your mind? Logically speaking, I should be happy that Qiao Xin is missing. Why should I help you find her?” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Yu didn’t speak, but Qiao Nian could still hear his rapid and nervous breathing through the phone.

It seemed that Qiao Yu was really worried about Qiao Xin.

It made sense. He might be cold, but he was a good brother. He had been worried about her like that before.

Only that once.

“Y-you really want her to disappear?” The man’s voice was laced with careful probing.

Qiao Nian’s eyes instantly turned cold. After a few seconds of silence, she questioned, “Do you think I kidnapped Qiao Xin?”

“I’m sorry—”

Hearing Qiao Yu’s words, Qiao Nian knew that he had admitted it.

The more Qiao Nian thought about it, the more ridiculous she found it. She snorted coldly and said, “Although I especially hate Qiao Xin, I won’t be like your family and play tricks behind her back. I’ll only trample on her openly. Don’t think that everyone is as dirty as your family!”

Qiao Yu’s grip on the phone tightened involuntarily.

Actually, when Qiao Nian fell silent, he had already regretted asking that question.

Qiao Nian had never been one to play tricks behind people’s backs. He had long known her personality, but he had lost his rationality because of Qiao Xin.

“Sorry,” Qiao Yu said and hung up.

Qiao Nian put her phone aside and smiled coldly.

When she was young, she was simply too naive. She actually thought that Qiao Yu would protect her.

It was ridiculous.

Although she had only slept for a while, she was much better now. She cleaned up briefly and went to the hospital.

At this moment, in the ward.

Gu Zhou and Chen Qing were talking. When Qiao Nian entered, they both looked at her.

As soon as Qiao Nian walked in, she noticed the fatigue on Gu Zhou’s face. Frowning slightly, she walked up to him and said softly, “You didn’t sleep last night. How do you feel?”

Gu Zhou’s hand, which had been playing with his ring, paused slightly. He hadn’t expected that he would be the first person Qiao Nian cared about.

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. His thin lips curled up slightly as he said softly, “I feel pretty good!”

Qiao Nian was speechless.

Qiao Nian didn’t know if Gu Zhou was praising her attitude or if he was referring to the feeling of not sleeping last night.

Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat, and her face heated up slightly. She silently looked away.

She wanted to understand Lu Zhu’s current physical condition today. If his body was still okay, the two of them could reunite today.

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian’s gaze landed on Lu Zhu’s face. She was asked Gu Zhou. “Did he wake up after I left?”

Gu Zhou shook his head.

When Qiao Nian heard this, she frowned slightly. It seemed that Lu Zhu’s body was still very weak.
