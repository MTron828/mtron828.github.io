What? Godfather?

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned.

“He’s calling me Dad now!”

Qiao Nian was stunned again, unable to regain her senses for a moment.

This was too much of a coincidence.

Qiao Nian was stunned for a moment, her eyes filled with anger. She continued, “What about Gu Qi’s inhumane father?”

Gu Zhou said, “… He’s overseas.”

“So what do you want to do?” Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou pursed his lips, his eyes filled with determination. “That’s why I want to bring him here. I want him to stay here so that I can take care of him!”

No matter what, he had to bring Gu Qi to his side, even if Qiao Nian was unwilling.

Qiao Nian almost suspected that there was something wrong with her ears. She thought that she had heard wrongly. Stunned for a moment, she asked in surprise, “Really?”

Gu Zhou replied, “Yes.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

In the past, when Jiang Yue lived here, he had always been worried about her presence. Now that there were no outsiders in the house, he wanted to bring Gu Qi back.

No outsiders?

At the thought of this, Gu Zhou couldn’t help but frown. He was a little surprised by his own thoughts.

Qiao Nian didn’t notice the change in Gu Zhou’s mood. A bright smile appeared on her face as she said happily, “That’s great. I think Grandma needs someone to accompany her now. If Xiao Qi is around, I think Grandma will be very happy!”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he was a little surprised.

He still remembered Qiao Nian saying that she didn’t like children.

Before he could speak, he saw Qiao Nian looking at him excitedly.

“Then when are we picking Gu Qi up?”

Gu Zhou had a strange feeling. His gaze fell on the medicine box on the ground and he asked in confusion, “Shouldn’t the medicine be applied now?”

Qiao Nian immediately shook her head. Afraid that Gu Zhou would think too much, she hurriedly explained, “Actually, it’s not that urgent. I’ll help you apply the medicine later!”

Gu Zhou was speechless.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but urge, “Children are weak. If this continues, it might cause other illnesses. Let’s hurry up and bring Gu Qi over so that I can treat him.”

Gu Zhou narrowed his eyes. Just as he was about to speak, he heard Qiao Nian urging him again.

“Where is he now? Let’s go!”

At this moment, there was a knock on the door. Chen Qing’s voice came from outside. “Second Young Master, I’ve already brought Young Master Gu Qi back.”

Qiao Nian was a little surprised. This was too fast!

Just now, Gu Zhou had said that he wanted to discuss things with her. She didn’t expect Gu Qi to have already arrived at the Gu family villa.

This meant that when she was chatting with Grandma just now, Gu Zhou had already asked Chen Qing to pick Gu Qi up. Now, he was just informing her.

Although Gu Zhou had pretended to discuss the matter with her, he had not considered her opinion.

Logically speaking, she should have been angry. However, she was not unhappy about this matter. Instead, she had a different opinion of Gu Zhou.

So Gu Zhou was kinder and more thoughtful than she had imagined.

Qiao Nian suddenly felt a little curious. She asked, “If I disagreed just now, what were you going to do?”

Gu Zhou looked Qiao Nian in the eye, his eyes cold. He enunciated each word clearly. “Then I can only ask you to leave!”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned, but she quickly smiled.

She didn’t seem to be angry at all. It seemed that Gu Qi wasn’t an unloved child. At the very least, Gu Qi had a high status in Gu Zhou’s heart. It seemed that Gu Qi was still very happy.

Qiao Nian’s heart was filled with relief. She raised her eyebrows slightly and her gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face. She praised him generously, “You’re much more reliable than his biological father!”
