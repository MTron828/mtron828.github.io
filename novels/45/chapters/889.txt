890 Little Princess

When Gu Zhou heard Gu Qi’s words, a trace of relief flashed in his eyes. His son was sensible. He was really happy.

“I heard that Auntie Song has already left. Sister can’t accept these things yet. I’ll definitely accompany her in the future and take good care of her so that she won’t be sad.”

Gu Zhou knew that Chen Qing must have told Gu Qi about these things. However, Chen Qing had glossed over the difficult parts. Now, he looked at Chen Qing with a gentler gaze and his temper improved.

What had happened today was already difficult for Xiao Shi to accept. He did not know if Xiao Shi could get over it. He was very worried that Xiao Shi would be too immersed in Song Man’s death.

At this moment, Qiao Nian had already packed up and walked out.

When Gu Qi saw Qiao Nian, his dark eyes lit up. He called out happily, “Mommy!”

Gu Zhou noticed the change in Gu Qi’s gaze and was slightly stunned. He turned to look at Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian walked up to Gu Qi with a smile. She squatted down and pinched Gu Qi’s chubby face. “Yes.”

The worry on Gu Qi’s face gradually faded, and he revealed a bright smile. He said happily, “That’s really great. Fortunately, that auntie isn’t Xiao Qi’s mommy, because Xiao Qi only wants Mommy Nian Nian to be Xiao Qi’s mommy.”

The smile on Qiao Nian’s face grew brighter and brighter as she pulled Gu Qi into her arms.

At this moment, she had already treated Gu Qi as her biological son.

Although she and Gu Qi were not biological mother and son, their relationship was no different from biological mother and son. She lowered her head slightly and planted a kiss on Gu Qi’s forehead. Smiling, she said, “I like Xiao Qi and Xiao Shi too.”

Gu Zhou was slightly stunned. He looked at Gu Qi’s forehead with a dark expression.

Gu Qi didn’t notice Gu Zhou’s gaze at all. He looked at Qiao Nian with sparkling eyes and asked expectantly, “Mommy, do you like Sister Xiao Shi too?”

“Of course. The two of you are so cute. Of course I like you,” Qiao Nian replied matter-of-factly.

Gu Qi asked impatiently, “Then is Mommy willing to be Sister’s mommy?”

When Gu Zhou heard Gu Qi’s question, he looked at Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian and Gu Qi had always been close. Gu Qi was also willing to get close to Qiao Nian. He was not surprised that Qiao Nian was willing to be Gu Qi’s mommy.

However, Xiao Shi was different.

When Xiao Shi was young, she lived with Song Man. In her heart, Song Man was more important. He didn’t know if Qiao Nian was willing to be her mommy under such circumstances.

Qiao Nian smiled and kissed Gu Qi’s little face. Smiling, she said, “Of course I’m willing, but it still depends on what Xiao Shi thinks. Xiao Qi, no matter how sad Xiao Shi is now, don’t mention this matter first. Let’s talk about this again when Xiao Shi isn’t sad anymore!”

Gu Qi’s face was red. Mommy had kissed him again.

Mommy was really so gentle. Not only was she willing to be his mommy, but she was also willing to be his sister’s mommy. Mommy was really the best person in the world.

Gu Qi came out of Qiao Nian’s arms and nodded excitedly. He waved at Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian and said happily, “Dad and Mommy, I want to accompany Sister and let her recover early. That way, Sister can be with Mommy earlier!”

Qiao Nian smiled gently and waved at Gu Qi.

How could Gu Qi be so cute?

After Gu Qi left the ward, Qiao Nian stood up straight and noticed a burning gaze on her.

She turned her head and saw Gu Zhou staring unblinkingly at her.

She recalled what she had almost done with Gu Zhou in the ward just now and blushed slightly. She hurriedly threw those shy thoughts to the back of her mind. Her gaze landed on Gu Zhou’s face and she said, “Um, when you were sleeping just now, I’ve already gotten someone to investigate Song Man’s situation. I’ve also gotten someone to unlock Song Man’s phone. I believe it won’t be long before we find the biological mother of the two children.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Gu Zhou nodded. As long as Qiao Nian didn’t leave, nothing else mattered.

He just wanted Qiao Nian to stay by his side. As for the mother of the two children, he could just compensate her with money.

The Gu family had nothing else but money.
