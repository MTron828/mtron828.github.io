Su Yan held Qiao Nian’s hand tightly. When she first reunited with Qiao Nian, she still thought that her eldest daughter would be the same when she went missing. Only later did she realize that more than twenty years had passed.

“Back then, we didn’t protect you well. If we had, you wouldn’t have been kidnapped by those people.” As Su Yan spoke, she glared at Lu You, as if blaming him. ‘You went to Europe to investigate the truth and for the sake of our family. If we aren’t able to catch those people, our family would be in danger at all times.”

Su Yan’s gaze swept across the children present. Her expression gradually turned serious, and there was a hint of worry in her eyes. “I don’t want anything to happen to anyone in our family again.”VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Lu Qi stood up and walked behind Su Yan. She hugged Su Yan from behind and gently leaned her head on Su Yan’s shoulder. “Mom, you don’t have to worry anymore. I’m really fine. Our family is so united and loving. Our brothers will also protect everyone. Those bad people will never hurt us again. ”

She knew that her mother had been frightened by what had happened to her

in the tunnel.

When Lu You heard Lu Qi’s words, he gently ruffled her hair and said gently to Su Yan, “Yan’er, you don’t have to worry. The children have already grown up.

The four of them have already grown up and can protect the entire family.”

As he spoke, Lu You glanced at his four sons, his expression becoming more and more serious. “You should know how to protect your family now, right? If anything happens to them…”

Lu You didn’t finish his sentence, but the threat was obvious.

Lu Zhu was the eldest. With a gentle smile on his face, he looked at everyone present. “Dad, this is what I should do. I’ll definitely protect them well.”

The other three nodded solemnly. Although they didn’t say anything, their duty to protect their family was already engraved in their bones.

“Alright, let’s eat.” Matriarch Lu smiled and said, “Your mother specially got someone to prepare your favorite food today. It’s not too late to talk after the meal when the family is together.”

Lu You nodded.

As Matriarch Lu and Lu You moved their chopsticks, everyone began to eat one after another.

During the meal, Lu Qi would tell a few jokes from time to time, making everyone laugh until their eyes curved up.

Auntie Cao, who was standing at the side, had a loving smile on her face. Her narrowed eyes were filled with coldness. Her gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face, and the hatred in her eyes was like a sharp blade, about to cut through Qiao Nian’s smooth and fair neck.

Qiao Nian sensed the killing intent and looked up, meeting Auntie Cads hatred.

Auntie Cao immediately put away the hatred in her eyes and maintained her composure. She smiled at Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian looked at Auntie Cao with a complicated expression. She had a nagging feeling that something was wrong with Auntie Cao, but she couldn’t put her finger on it.

Auntie Cao was an old member of the Lu family. Without any evidence, Qiao Nian couldn’t spout nonsense. She retracted her gaze and smiled at Su Yan.

Seeing Qiao Nian retract her gaze, Auntie Cao heaved a sigh of relief. At this moment, she inadvertently met Gu Zhou’s gaze.

Gu Zhou’s gaze seemed to have the ability to see through her heart. Auntie Cao was so frightened that she stood there stiffly, her breathing hitching.

Auntie Cao felt her face stiffen. After a long while, she smiled and nodded slightly to express her courtesy.

Xiao Shi tugged at Gu Zhou’s gaze. Only then did Gu Zhou look at Xiao Shi.

At this moment, Auntie Cao felt as if she had just survived a calamity. Just now, Gu Zhou’s eyes did not contain any killing intent, but those dark eyes that did not have a trace of light made her feel as if she had fallen into an endless abyss.

Fear, suffocation, and despair surged in her heart.

After a long time, Auntie Cao finally recovered. Only then did she notice that her back was already drenched.

After Auntie Cao recovered, she stole a glance at Gu Zhou and saw him elegantly picking up food for the three children. He still looked as noble as an immortal.

However, she knew in her heart that Gu Zhou was a demon..
