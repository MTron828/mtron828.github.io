Chapter 155 I Won’t Use Things That Don’t Belong to Me

Qiao Nian narrowed her eyes dangerously. She had always kept a low profile in the past, but Jiang Yue had already crossed the line today.

A formal gown could not be worn by someone else after being worn once. It would be impolite for another person to wear it again.

She had already worn the gown her grandmother had made. Since Jiang Yue did not seem to mind being humiliated, she would let Jiang Yue wear it. It would be too late for Jiang Yue to regret her actions in the future.

Qiao Nian took out her phone and made a call. “The lecture hall of the Second Academy of Medicine. Help me select a gown.”

With that, Qiao Nian hung up.

Jiang Yue, who was standing at the side, was slightly stunned. A trace of anger flashed in her eyes, and her tone turned cold. “This gown was Grandma’s gift to you. How dare you not want it? You’re crossing a line!”

“I’m sorry, I’m not like you. I’ll never use things that don’t belong to me.” Qiao Nian looked at Jiang Yue coldly.

A trace of panic flashed in Jiang Yue’s heart, but she calmed down very quickly. Holding the gown, she walked towards the changing room.

There was no way Grandma would make a gown for Qiao Nian. Grandma liked her the most. Grandma would only make gowns for her!

Qiao Nian was indeed from the countryside. She didn’t know any etiquette at all. She was kind enough to help Qiao Nian, but Qiao Nian didn’t appreciate it.

Since that was the case, she would let Qiao Nian make a fool of herself in front of everyone. How could the gowns Qiao Nian owned be any good? She would definitely be wearing cheap and unpresentable clothes. Jiang Yue pursed her lips. When that happened, even if Grandma asked, she could say that she had tried to persuade Qiao Nian.

Everyone watched as Jiang Yue left. Then, their gazes all fell on Qiao Nian.

They had thought that Qiao Nian would fly into a rage out of humiliation. They hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to be leaning against the wall and chatting with a young girl, looking relaxed and happy.

Seeing that Qiao Nian was pretending to be calm, everyone couldn’t help but laugh. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“She didn’t manage to get her hands on the gown made by Matriarch Gu. Is that why she’s gone crazy? Do you think she’s planning to wear this outfit onstage?” “Who knows? She doesn’t even want to wear the gown made by Mr. S. Her standards must be very high. Even so, I bet she’ll be wearing a cheap, hideous gown when she goes on stage to give her speech later.”

“That’s right. Later on, we’ll be able to see what kind of gown Qiao Nian will be wearing. Perhaps she’ll be giving a lecture on how to snatch other people’s clothes!”

Qiao Nian’s brow furrowed slightly. It wasn’t because she was unhappy with what the onlookers were saying, but because she could feel Qiao Yu staring at her. That gaze made her uncomfortable.

Qiao Nian was now completely certain that Qiao Yu and Qiao Xin had long known that she wasn’t Qiao Shan and Su Xue’s biological daughter. That was why Qiao Yu had done those beastly things. About ten minutes later, Jiang Yue appeared in front of everyone in the diamond-encrusted gown, instantly attracting everyone’s attention.

Everyone looked enviously at the beautiful, eye-catching gown Jiang Yue was wearing.

The unique patterns were inlaid with luxurious diamonds, complementing the overall design of the gown. Everyone was stunned.

“Oh my god, it’s beautiful!”

“This gown truly lives up to the status of being Matriarch Gu’s handiwork. It’s simply gorgeous!”

“Qiao Nian must be dreaming to think that she’d ever be able to wear this gown. Does she think she’s worthy of such a beautiful gown?”

“Didn’t she ask someone to send a gown over? The gown she’s bringing must have cost only a few hundred dollars. It won’t be comparable to a gown handmade by Matriarch Gu at all!”

After admiring the gown, everyone’s gaze fell on Jiang Yue’s face. All of them realized that the effect was rather strange. Jiang Yue was very good-looking, but this gown did not match Jiang Yue’s aura at all. There was an indescribable incongruity.

This gown was flawlessly beautiful, but with Jiang Yue’s face and figure, it looked much more ordinary.

She looked like an innocent student who had insisted on wearing heavy makeup to hide her original temperament. The gown looked out of place on her.

At this moment, five young girls walked in, each carrying two gowns covered by black cloth.
