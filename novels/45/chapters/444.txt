Chen Qing nodded and said very respectfully, “Young Master, Uncle Zang has sent news that he has indeed seen Eldest Young Master in MY!”

Gu Zhou leaned back in his chair lazily, his frown deepening.

If he wasn’t dead, why hadn’t he come home?

Chen Qing also felt that it was strange. Since Eldest Young Master was still alive, why hadn’t he returned to the Gu family? After all, Old Madam Gu had been thinking about Eldest Young Master all day.

However, Eldest Young Master had already disappeared for five years.

Chen Qing did not have a deep impression of Eldest Young Master. In his impression, Eldest Young Master always smiled gently.

According to Uncle Zang, although Eldest Young Master was still alive, he might have lost his memory.

Only by finding Eldest Young Master himself could he confirm what was going on.

Second Young Master had come to MY for this matter. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

After hanging up, Qiao Nian frowned slightly, still thinking about Gu Zhou’s last words.

If the two of them were face to face, how would she answer Gu Zhou’s question?

......

Could it be that he had to tell Gu Zhou bluntly that it was impossible for them to consummate their marriage?

Qiao Nian took a deep breath and tried her best to put this question to the back of her mind.

She glanced at the time. There was still some time before boarding. She could still take a nap.

At this moment, the ringtone of the phone suddenly rang.

Qiao Nian had originally thought that it was Gu Zhou calling, but when she saw that it was Gu Qi on the other end of the line.

Qiao Nian’s expression softened involuntarily. After answering the call, she placed the phone to her ear and said in a gentler voice, “Xiao Qi.”

“Auntie, you seem to have forgotten something.”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She only remembered that Gu Qi still owed her money. She couldn’t remember anything else.

Qiao Nian asked, “What is it?”

“You promised me before that you would help me find Mommy.”

Hearing Gu Qi’s sad voice, Qiao Nian’s heart suddenly ached. She said apologetically, “Xiao Qi…”

Qiao Nian pursed her lips and continued, “I’ve already sent your DNA for testing. However, it’ll take a long time to find your family. It might take a while.”

“Did you find her, then?”

“No.” Qiao Nian lowered her eyes, her expression a little gloomy.

When Gu Qi heard Qiao Nian’s words, he had a strange feeling.

If only Auntie could be his mother!

Sadly, Auntie wasn’t his mother.

Gu Qi said a little disappointedly, “I thought that with the sample, I would be able to find Mommy soon.”

Qiao Nian felt as if her heart had been pricked by a needle. When she returned, she would definitely help Gu Qi find his mommy, so that he could reunite with her as soon as possible and not be disappointed again.

However, what puzzled Qiao Nian was why Gu Qi had suddenly mentioned this.

Qiao Nian estimated the time. It should be around five in the afternoon in An City, which meant that Gu Qi had just finished school.

Could it be that something had happened to Gu Qi again?

However, Qiao Nian couldn’t ask Gu Qi directly, as she was afraid that it would hurt his pride.

“Xiao Qi, are you home now?”

“No one’s picking me up!”

Qiao Nian understood now. It must be because Gu Qi had seen that all the other children had mothers, but not him. That was why Gu Qi had called to ask her if she had found his mother.

“Xiao Qi, can I pick you up from school after I return?”

Gu Qi had a strange feeling in his heart. He hung up the phone without hesitation, his eyes a little red.

He only wanted his mommy to pick him up from school.

Where the hell was his mommy?

Gu Qi was usually very strong, but at this moment, he was still very sad.

Gu Qi’s classmate, Zhou Qian, glanced at Gu Qi and deliberately made a face. He shouted, “A child without a mother is just a stinky child picked up from the trash!”

Another little boy looked at Gu Qi curiously and asked, “Xiao Qi, did your mother throw you into the trash can because you couldn’t speak?”

Gu Qi’s hand stiffened slightly, and his bright eyes instantly darkened. His small hands clenched into fists.
