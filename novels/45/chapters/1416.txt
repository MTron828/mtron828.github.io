1417 Extravagance

Gu Zhou walked over to Qiao Nian and naturally took her hand. He said gently, “We should set off.”

“Yes.” Qiao Nian smiled gently at Gu Zhou and followed him out.

“Sister, I’ll send you off.” Lu Qi hurriedly followed her. After taking two steps, she looked at Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian holding hands and recalled how Qin Chuan had held her hand just now. She couldn’t help but blush.

The three of them had just walked out of the ward when they saw Xu Feng walking in.

Xu Feng was also someone close to Gu Zhou. He was here to take care of Qin Chuan on behalf of Chen Qing.

“Hello, Second Young Master, Second Young Madam, and Miss Lu,” Xu Feng greeted.

Qiao Nian smiled and said very politely, “Thank you for taking care of Qin Chuan from now on.”

Xu Feng smiled and said, “Second Young Madam, this is what I should do.”

With that, he looked up at Gu Zhou and continued, “Second Young Master, when I came here, Eldest Young Master Lu had already brought Matriarch Lu and the three children to the Lu family.”

When Qiao Nian heard Xu Feng’s words, her lips curved up slightly. She wanted Big Brother’s men to take care of Grandma Gu and the three children, but she didn’t expect Big Brother to have already thought of this.

Qiao Nian knew that her brother had always been cautious. She believed that he would definitely be able to take good care of everyone.

Gu Zhou nodded slightly and said, “Okay.” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Chen Qing and Xu Feng briefly handed over the matter before leaving with Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian.

Lu Qi stood at the door of Qin Chuan’s ward and watched as her sister and brother-in-law left. Her heart felt as if it was weighed down by a rock.

She only hoped that she could catch the person who wanted to harm the Lu family as soon as possible. That way, the family would be safe.

…

When Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian came out of the hospital, he asked worriedly, “Could the other members of the Lu family have been poisoned too?”

Qiao Nian shook her head gently and said seriously, “I don’t think so. The Hypnotic Worm is very powerful. This kind of worm is very rare. It takes ten years to cultivate a Hypnotic Worm. Not only that, this worm needs to eat precious medicinal ingredients during the cultivation process. A Hypnotic Worm costs more than a million yuan to be raised to an adult.”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he heaved a sigh of relief. Then, he wouldn’t have to worry about the rest of the Lu family being hypnotized.

Qiao Nian understood Gu Zhou’s worry. She said, “I reminded Big Brother previously and the servants of the Lu family are now in groups of three. No one will be left alone again. Even if someone is poisoned, he won’t have a chance to make a move.”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Gu Zhou heaved a sigh of relief.

After getting on the plane, Gu Zhou sat down beside Qiao Nian and thought of the news from Chang Feng.

At least two groups of people were keeping an eye on the Gu and Lu families. When Gu Zhou thought of those people hiding in the dark, his frown deepened. He had a vague feeling that if they couldn’t find those people, the next generation would still be targeted by them.

Soon, they arrived in Europe.

This European country was built on the sea. This was a very rich country. The population of this country was very small. Due to this, all the policies were good. Everyone could be assigned a house when they reached adulthood.

However, there was a huge gap between the rich and the poor here. The people in the slums barely had enough to eat and work.

On the streets of the rich district, everyone was wearing branded clothes and carrying branded bags. All of them were dressed up beautifully.

However, when Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian came out of the airport, they still attracted the attention of many people.

The main thing was that the noble aura and perfect facial features the two of them exuded made everyone unable to take their eyes off them.

After that, the two of them got into a world-class luxury car. Beside the luxury car were six to two luxury cars and 30 bodyguards in black.

When everyone saw Qiao Nian, they immediately stood up straight and greeted respectfully, “Eldest Miss, son-in-law!”

At this moment, Qiao Nian felt as if she had transmigrated into the God of War book.

Fourth Brother was really rich. He had to make such a big scene when picking her up. He was going to make her appear in the headlines!
