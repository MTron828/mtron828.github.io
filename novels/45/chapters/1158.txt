1159 Prince

Qiao Nian frowned. After speaking to Song Yu, she entered the room.

“Sister Song Yu, I’ll go in too. Rest early. Goodnight!” Lu Qi waved at Song Yu and said with a smile.

Seeing that Qiao Nian had returned, Song Yu was worried about her brothers. After some thought, she picked up the cup on the bedside table and pretended to go downstairs to pour water.

When she walked to the living room, there was no one there.

Could it be that Mom didn’t hit her brothers?

Song Yu’s eyes lit up. She quickly walked upstairs, her footsteps getting faster and faster. In the end, she began to jog.

Song Yu still remembered that in the past, when her brothers knelt as punishment, she would take a big cushion and place it under their knees.

Song Yu ran back to her room and quickly walked towards the ancestral hall with the big cushion in the closet.

When she opened the door again, she carefully looked around. Seeing that there was no one around, she quietly ran towards the ancestral hall.

Just as she ran to the entrance of the ancestral hall, Lu Nian’s happy laughter came from inside.

Song Yu’s footsteps gradually slowed down. She looked up and saw the bright smile on Lu Nian’s face.

It had been a long time since she had seen Second Brother smile so happily.

Qiao Nian stood in the middle and spread a blanket on the ground. Lu Qi spread another blanket on it and said happily, “Alright, kneeling on the blanket definitely won’t hurt anymore! Sister is still the smartest. You all have to thank Sister for coming up with such a good idea!”

Qiao Nian squatted on the ground and knelt tentatively on the blanket. Smiling at everyone, she said, “Alright, there are two blankets. It definitely won’t be a problem to kneel for an hour.”

Lu Nian stood at the side and looked at Qiao Nian’s sweet smile. In a daze, he recalled how she had looked when she was young. At that time, she smiled like this and listened to his piano music.

He bent down and rubbed Qiao Nian’s head. Seeing that her hair was a little messy, his mood improved. “What a smart girl!” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Nian’s words, her smile grew even brighter.

The others joined in the laughter.

Song Yu stood outside the ancestral hall, hugging the cushion in her hand tightly. Seeing the smile on Lu Nian’s face, her lips curved up involuntarily.

When one liked someone, they would really be happy because they were happy.

In the past, Second Brother would smile at her like this, but at that time, Second Brother’s smile was less doting on her.

She was originally an orphan. Her mother had brought her out of the orphanage. At that time, she was thin and small, and she was wearing old clothes covered in patches. That dress had been kindly given to her by her sister from the orphanage. Her original clothes were even more tattered.

When she saw the Lu family, it was as if she had seen heaven.

At that time, her mother had asked her to play casually in the living room. Her mother seemed to have something to do and took a call.

The Lu family’s living room was even larger than the hall of the orphanage. There was even a white marble floor. She did not dare to walk in at all, afraid that her muddy shoes would dirty the floor.

The Cinderella in the fairy tale should be like her!

She stood uneasily at the door, not daring to enter.

At this moment, a young man walked over from the stairs. That young man was none other than her second brother, Lu Nian.

He was like a prince in a comic book. He was wearing a white suit with a red bow at the collar. His fine hair shone in the sunlight.

He was like an elegant prince. When he saw her, he walked to the coffee table, took a piece of candy, walked to the door, and handed it to her. A gentle smile appeared on his face. “Eat!”

She really hadn’t expected a prince to really be willing to talk to her. She didn’t dare to reach out and take the candy. She would only look at the prince stupidly.

At that moment, she realized that there really was a prince in the world!

Auntie Cao walked in and smiled at her. “Miss Song, this is your second brother. Hurry up and call him Second Brother. Thank you for the candy Second Brother gave you!”

“Second Brother” she called out softly.

Lu Nian took her hand and placed the candy into her palm.
