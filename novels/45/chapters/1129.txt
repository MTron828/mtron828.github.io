1130 My condolences

Qiao Nian frowned slightly. It seemed that there was a dead end again. She lowered her gaze, her eyes filled with disappointment.

Jiang Chi realized that something was wrong with Qiao Nian’s expression and asked, “What do you mean by asking me these questions!”

“I can’t explain it in a few words.” As Qiao Nian spoke, she took out Jiang Cheng’s diary from her bag and handed it to Jiang Chi. “When you finish reading Jiang Cheng’s diary, you’ll know why I’m asking these questions. However, I hope you’re mentally prepared!”

Jiang Chi took the diary from Jiang Cheng. His hand inadvertently trembled, and his fingers gently caressed the cover of the diary.

Qiao Nian looked at Jiang Chi and said softly, “When Jiang Cheng lived in the Lu family, he kept a diary. Later on, something happened to him, and you didn’t want to interact with the Lu family, so his belongings were sealed and placed in the guest room he used to stay in. This diary was locked with Luban locks. I want to talk to you after you read it. We might be able to make new discoveries.”

Jiang Chi did not speak. He stared unblinkingly at the diary in his hand, his eyes red-rimmed. His fingers gently opened the diary.

At that time, when he found out that something had happened to his brother, he only took his brother’s corpse away. When the Lu family said that his brother’s belongings were unimportant, he didn’t intend to take them!

He remembered that his brother had a habit of keeping a diary when he was young, but his brother had not kept a diary much after that. Now, it seemed that his brother was just keeping a diary behind his back!

At this moment, Jiang Chi was no longer as cold and heartless as before. He looked at the diary in his hand, exuding a sorrowful aura.

Lu Qi looked at Jiang Chi. Although she had hated Jiang Chi and was very afraid of him previously, at this moment, her heart really ached for him. Her hatred for Jiang Cheng had already disappeared!

From another perspective, as an elder brother who missed his younger brother, he had to fulfill his younger brother’s last wish even if he was no longer alive. Jiang Chi really doted on his younger brother, which was why he had gone to the extreme!

Only after losing one’s family would one understand what pain meant!

Jiang Chi looked down at the diary in his hand. Jiang Cheng’s gentle smile appeared in his mind. His bloodthirsty eyes were filled with gentleness as he slowly opened the diary.

He flipped open the first page and read the contents. His gaze became even gentler, as if he was looking at Jiang Cheng face to face.

He read the diary very slowly, as if he had seen Jiang Cheng. He couldn’t bear to look back.

He looked at the diary slowly. Every time he saw a different diary entry, his gaze changed.

When Jiang Chi read the diary, his eyes turned red. His hand, which was holding the diary, trembled crazily.

Seeing this, Qiao Nian sighed helplessly.

Actually, she didn’t want Jiang Chi to see Jiang Cheng’s diary at all. This was too cruel for Jiang Chi.

Jiang Chi pursed his thin lips and held the diary in front of him, reading what Jiang Cheng had written word by word.

He had a genetic illness. The doctor had once said that he would not live past thirty in that state. Every day, he would suffer from the illness.

Later on, his younger brother said that he had found a way to prevent him from feeling pain. At that time, he didn’t think too much about it and listened to Jiang Cheng’s instructions to undergo surgery.

After the surgery, his health improved. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Only now did he understand that his silly brother had actually given him a kidney!

Now that he thought about it, his brother was indeed very abnormal back then. After the surgery, his brother insisted on leaving home on the pretext of studying!

At that time, he really didn’t think too much about it. His younger brother was already obsessed with medicine. In addition, Lu Zhu’s mother was a world-renowned forensic doctor. As the older brother, he couldn’t stop his younger brother from being motivated.

Jiang Chi felt a lump in his throat, and his eyes were a little hot. He was both sad and helpless. Why was his brother so stupid?

His heart seemed to be clenched tightly by an invisible hand. It hurt so much that he couldn’t breathe.

I’m sorry!

Jiang Cheng.

Brother has let you down.

He should have cared more about Jiang Cheng in the past, not just thinking about expanding his territory. If he had realized that something was wrong with his brother back then, would he have been able to stop him from operating on him?
