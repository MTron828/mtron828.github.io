“Alright, I’ll send you the location now.”

Lu Nian’s voice sounded relaxed and happy. His voice rose slightly, indicating that he was in a very good mood.

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Nian’s voice, Lu Nian’s devilish face flashed in her eyes. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

When Second Brother smiled, he would definitely charm thousands of young girls.

Qiao Nian was in a daze. She couldn’t help but call out, “Brother.”

Lu Nian was slightly stunned when he heard Qiao Nian’s voice. His voice was a little hazy, making him think of Sugar again.

In the past, when Sugar was sleepy, she would call her in this tone.

Qiao Nian quickly came back to her senses. Realizing that she had lost her composure, she hurriedly said, “It’s settled then. I’ll look for you tonight.”

“Alright, I’ll wait for you.” Lu Nian nodded.

After Qiao Nian hung up, she heaved a long sigh of relief. She couldn’t help but smile.

“Auntie, are you going out tonight?” Gu Qi tilted his head and looked at Qiao Nian intently.

Qiao Nian reached out to hold Gu Qi’s hand. She really wanted to return to the Lu family home now and reunite with her family.

But she couldn’t do that.

Not only for her own safety, but also for the safety of everyone in the Lu family.

Before she found her family, she had left it to fate.

But now that she knew that her family was right in front of her and she couldn’t acknowledge them, the longing that was engraved in her bones made her miss them dearly.

This feeling was indescribable.

“Yes, I’m going out tonight.” Qiao Nian smiled at Gu Qi, staring unblinkingly at his little face. She wondered where Gu Qi’s biological mother was. It seemed that she would have to send more people to help Gu Qi find his mother.

“Oh.” When Gu Qi heard Qiao Nian’s words, his eyes gradually darkened. He lowered his head and replied, his mood extremely low.

“What’s wrong? Are you feeling unwell?” Qiao Nian looked at Gu Qi worriedly. He placed his hand on Gu Qi’s arm.

Gu Qi’s pulse was very calm. He seemed to be fine.

“Auntie, can you still tell me stories tonight?” Gu Qi asked carefully, his eyes filled with anticipation.

After Gu Qi finished speaking, he felt a little vexed. Would Auntie Nian Nian hate him because he was too clingy?

“Then I’ll tell you a story early tonight. How about that?” Qiao Nian smiled and negotiated.

Although she knew very well that Gu Qi was not her child, she could not help but treat Gu Qi as her own.

The gloominess on Gu Qi’s face disappeared. He looked up at Qiao Nian, his heart filled with joy.

Qiao Nian took Gu Qi out to play for a while. Then, she asked Gu Qi to go play with the other servants and walked towards the embroidery room.

She was going to see Lu Nian tonight, so she had to go embroider the blessing bag early.

Qiao Nian sat in the embroidery room. When she thought of Lu Nian calling her today, her lips curved up involuntarily.

Suddenly, the vibration of her phone interrupted her thoughts.

Qiao Nian glanced at the caller ID and hurriedly picked up the call. Holding the phone to her ear, she called out excitedly, “Brother!”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s happy voice, Lu Zhu’s fatigue from the day was swept away. His lips curved up involuntarily, and his voice was gentle. “Sugar, are you free tonight?”

The smile on Qiao Nian’s face froze slightly, and a trace of confusion flashed in her eyes. She didn’t understand why Eldest Brother and Second Brother had invited her tonight. Could it be that today was some special day?

Qiao Nian thought for a moment and asked, “Brother, is there anything urgent tonight?”

“No, I just wanted to have dinner with you.”

Lu Zhu’s voice sounded as gentle as water.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but fall into a dilemma.

She wanted to have a meal with Big Brother today, but she had already promised Second Brother.

However, she found it difficult to reject either one.

She was indeed a greedy person. She wanted everything.

The more Qiao Nian thought about it, the more her head ached. She couldn’t help but sigh.

“Sugar?”

Qiao Nian suddenly came back to her senses. Although she really wanted to split herself in half and meet both her eldest and second brothers, this was very unrealistic.
