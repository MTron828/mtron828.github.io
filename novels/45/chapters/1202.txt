1203 Mrs. Gu

At a glance, she could see that he had endured hardship from his face.

Thank you readers!

Mr. Chen’s gaze swept past Qiao Nian, finally landing on Gu Zhou, who was beside her. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on Mr. Chen’s face. This was the first time he had seen him. When he looked into Mr. Chen’s dark eyes, he felt a vague sense of familiarity.

He seemed to have seen these eyes before, but he couldn’t remember where.

Mr. Chen’s gaze felt familiar. Before Gu Zhou could figure out where he had seen such a gaze before, he saw Mr. Chen walking towards him.

Mr. Chen’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. He reached out his hand, his thin lips curving up slightly. “Miss Qiao, it’s good to see you again!”

A faint smile appeared on Qiao Nian’s face. She handed her hand over and shook Mr. Chen’s.

According to etiquette, she should have let go immediately, but Qiao Nian didn’t. Instead, her grip tightened.

“Miss Qiao, what are you…” Mr. Chen smiled and asked in confusion.

“Mr. Chen.” Qiao Nian held Mr. Chen’s hand tightly, suppressing the surprise in her heart. She slowly retracted her hand. “This is my husband, Gu Zhou.”

As Qiao Nian spoke, she turned slightly and introduced Gu Zhou to Mr. Chen.

Mr. Chen looked like a middle-aged man in his forties, but she had just touched his hand. According to the bone examination technique in Chinese medicine, he should be in his twenties.

Mr. Chen’s face and bone age were about ten years apart. If she remembered correctly, Mr. Chen was almost forty years old.

Could it be that Mr. Chen had used a disguise technique to change his face?

Qiao Nian looked at Mr. Chen’s face. His face was very natural, and he didn’t look like he was lying at all.

Mr. Chen’s gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face. There was a hint of a smile in his eyes as he reached out to Gu Zhou and said, “Hello, Mr. Gu.”

Gu Zhou reached out to shake Mr. Chen’s hand. “Hello, Mr. Chen. I’ve heard a lot about you.”

“Mr. Gu, you and your wife look like a match made in heaven.” Mr. Chen’s lips curved up slightly as he retracted his hand with a smile.

Gu Zhou stared unblinkingly into Mr. Chen’s eyes. For some reason, he felt that the way Mr. Chen looked at Nian’er was a little strange.

He couldn’t say the details. Gu Zhou retracted his hand and reached out to hug Qiao Nian’s waist. Although Mr. Chen had already acknowledged that Qiao Nian was his wife, he couldn’t help but want to declare his sovereignty.

Qiao Nian was sensitive enough to sense the war between Gu Zhou and Mr. Chen. Her gaze darted between Gu Zhou and Mr. Chen, and she smiled to break the awkward silence. “Mr. Chen, I hope you’ll have fun. However, after the banquet, I’ve prepared a gift for you.”

Mr. Chen retracted his gaze from Gu Zhou’s face and his gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. He smiled and said, “Thank you, Mrs. Gu.”

With that, Mr. Chen walked towards the display cabinet.

Wherever Mr. Chen walked, the crowd automatically made way for him. Everyone’s eyes were filled with respect. At this moment, Mr. Chen was like the revered ruler of a country.

Gu Zhou watched as Mr. Chen left. He tightened his grip on Qiao Nian’s waist involuntarily and whispered into her ear, “He keeps looking at you.”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she looked up at him and realized that he was jealous. Smiling, she reminded him, “Mrs. Gu, do you understand?”

“Some people don’t mean what they say. In order to let others lower their guard,” Gu Zhou said, his eyes narrowing slightly. “Mr. Chen is really not a simple person.”

Qiao Nian gave a perfunctory reply.

This time, Mr. Chen did not come alone. He even specially brought his personal cutter.

Mr. Chen walked to a display cabinet and looked at the untrimmed quarry stones inside. Then, he said, “This one will do.”

Mr. Chen’s personal cutter hurriedly began to clean the raw stones, preparing to start.

Jiang Chi stood at the stairs on the second floor, holding a glass of red wine. He looked down at Mr. Chen on the first floor and clenched his fists involuntarily.
