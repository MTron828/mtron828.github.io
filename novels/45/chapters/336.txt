Chapter 337: I’m Here to Look For Gu Qi

However when she walked into the school, the security guard saw that her face was a little unfamiliar and hurriedly stopped her.

However, after the system identified her as the child’s parent, she was allowed to enter.

Qiao Nian passed through the rockery and fountain and arrived at a dream-like castle. She walked to the door of Gu Qi’s class. Instead of knocking, she stood outside the classroom window.

Qiao Nian glanced around but didn’t see the little child.

However, her gaze was attracted to a little boy sitting by the window.

The little boy had his head lowered the entire time, so she couldn’t see his face clearly. His hands were long and slender, and he was nimbly playing with nine Chinese rings.

In just a few minutes, he had already unlocked six rings.

Qiao Nian looked at the little boy in disbelief.

How could a child play with the nine Chinese rings so smoothly?

The little girl sitting next to the little boy kept staring at the nine consecutive rings in his hand. Seeing that several of the nine consecutive rings had already been unlocked, she reached out to snatch them away.

The little boy avoided the little girl’s hand slightly and shielded the nine Chinese rings in his arms.

When the little girl saw this, she immediately began to cry.

The little girl’s cries instantly attracted the teacher’s attention.

At this moment, a young and beautiful female teacher walked over. She looked like she had just graduated from school.

When the little girl saw the teacher walking over, she immediately ran to the teacher and hugged her leg, complaining in a childish voice, “Teacher Qin, he bullied me. He stole my nine Chinese rings and still wants to hit me. Sob…”

The young and beautiful female teacher looked at the little boy coldly and questioned sternly, “Gu Qi, why do you always bully your classmates? You even snatched their toys this time!”

When Qiao Nian heard the teacher call the little boy’s name, she froze.

Could he be the young lady from that night?

But it didn’t feel like it.

The little boy stood there motionless, as if he was very unwilling to bother with the teacher.

The teacher had no patience. In a rage, she walked up to the little boy, grabbed his collar, and pulled him over forcefully. “Are you mute? If you’re mute, then go to a school for disabled people. Don’t come here. Get your parents to bring you back now!”

Qiao Nian’s gaze turned cold. Regardless of whether this child was the young lady from that night, Gu Qi, this teacher had maligned this child without distinguishing between right and wrong. This was too much!

Qiao Nian walked over and knocked on the classroom door.

When the teacher heard the knock on the door, she immediately changed her appearance. With a gentle smile, she looked toward the door. At this moment, the little boy, who was being held by the teacher, also turned to look.

This time, Qiao Nian saw the little boy’s face clearly. Wasn’t this the young lady from that night, Gu Qi?

So he was not a young lady, but a little boy. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

When Gu Qi saw her, his beautiful eyes sparkled like the stars in the night sky.

In her high heels, the teacher elegantly opened the door for Qiao Nian and asked gently, “Hello, parent. Which child are you looking for?”

Qiao Nian’s gaze swept over the teacher. Her figure was very good, and she was wearing a strapless dress. Her fair and sexy collarbone was exposed.

Even though she was a woman, she couldn’t help but take another look at this teacher.

In addition, this teacher was quite beautiful and had exquisite makeup on. When she smiled, she looked very approachable.

What made Qiao Nian uncomfortable was that this teacher seemed to look like she was on a blind date instead of teaching.

Qiao Nian frowned. She had always been a good judge of character. If she wasn’t wrong, this teacher might just want to get to know some people of high status through the children.

“I’m here to see Gu Qi.”
