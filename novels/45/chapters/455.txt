She hadn’t fainted from the pain, but from shock.

Jiang Chi stood up coldly and looked down at Song Yue.

This woman was too ambitious and jealous, so she wanted to kill his woman. In that case, he would make sure that she could never be a woman again!

Jiang Chi said lightly, “Let’s go and see Lu Zhu now!”

The green snake was very human-like. It seemed to know what Jiang Chi was talking about and quickly slithered towards him, obediently submitting at his feet.

Jiang Chi bent down slightly and picked up the green snake, placing it in his palm. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Song Yue, who was lying in the hall, was bleeding all over the ground. There was also a hole in her lower abdomen and her uterus was damaged.

When Jiang Chi walked to the side hall, there was no longer the luxury of the main hall. There was only silence.

Perhaps it was because it was so quiet that it felt eerie.

The room on the left was where Lu Zhu was.

At the thought of Lu Zhu, Jiang Chi’s eyes instantly turned red with hatred.

Lu Zhu!

It was all Lu Zhu’s fault!

If it weren’t for Lu Zhu, his younger brother wouldn’t have died.

Jiang Cheng.

His poor brother.

When the mercenary saw Jiang Chi walking over, he nodded slightly.

“Is he dead?” Jiang Chi asked coldly.

“Still breathing!”

“Keep him alive. If he dies, you won’t be able to live either!” Jiang Chi ordered ruthlessly.

He wanted to make Lu Zhu’s life a living hell.

Boom!

Suddenly, there was the sound of artillery fire outside!

Jiang Chi frowned. He looked over and saw that half of the sky was lit up by flames through the French windows.

In an instant, the fire was gone again, and smoke billowed.

At this moment, a young mercenary quickly walked in and reported, “Chief Jiang, Qiao Nian is now holding a rocket launcher and blowing up the central hall. The central hall has collapsed!”

Jiang Chi frowned and asked hesitantly, “Who did you just say?”

“Qiao Nian.”

After the mercenary said that, he quickly lowered his head and did not dare to say anything else.

If it were an ordinary person, they would have directly started fighting with him. However, this time, it was Qin Chuan’s men.

They had never expected Qiao Nian to be related to Qin Chuan.

Moreover, Jiang Chi had previously said that he absolutely could not hurt Qiao Nian. He could only come over to report about her.

The mercenary originally thought that Jiang Chi would be angry, but he did not expect the corners of Jiang Chi’s mouth to curl up.

Jiang Chi was handsome. When he smiled, people couldn’t take their eyes off him.

Everyone found it unbelievable.

Jiang Chi rubbed his chin gently, his eyes filled with surprise.

The woman he liked was completely different from those beauties.

Jiang Chi’s smile gradually disappeared. His gaze landed on the mercenary’s face and he said, “Let her in now. If she’s hurt at all, you won’t be alive anymore!”

“Yes!”

Jiang Chi said to the mercenaries guarding Lu Zhu’s door, “Keep an eye on him now!”

“Yes!”

Jiang Chi walked out happily. He wanted to personally welcome his smart and beautiful princess.

Jiang Chi walked out.

At this moment, outside the hall.

Qiao Nian stood rooted to the ground coldly and ordered loudly, “There are still three minutes. If they don’t send Lu Zhu out, I’ll blow up Jiang Chi’s house! I’ll send them to hell!”

“Yes!” everyone replied loudly.

Their hearts surged.

From a long time ago, they had known that they had two masters. One was Qin Chuan, and the other was the legendary Miss Qiao.

In the past, they had been a little unconvinced with Miss Qiao, but now that they had seen her today, they only had admiration for her.

Actually, they were not afraid of Jiang Chi. Moreover, both sides were of similar strength. In the past, when there were conflicts, they would at most negotiate.

However, it was different for Miss Qiao. She directly asked them to fire their cannons.

To be honest, they had long wanted to do such an exciting thing.

One mountain couldn’t contain two tigers. They should have fought Jiang Chi long ago!
