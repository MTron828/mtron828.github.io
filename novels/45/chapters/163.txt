Chapter 164 Reversal

How could this be?

Jiang Yue managed to squeeze out a slightly unnatural smile. Her gentle voice trembled as she said, “Grandma, are you joking? All my gowns were handmade by you!”

If Jiang Yue had not said this, Matriarch Gu would not have been so angry. This was the first time she had made a gown for Nian Nian. This was a token of her appreciation for Nian Nian, but it had been ruined by the granddaughter she had watched grow up.

“Jiang Yue, does the gown you’re wearing now fit you?” Matriarch Gu asked coldly. “The waist of the gown is about to tear from the tightness. The gown is already deformed from the strain, and it has lost its beauty…”

“Grandma!” Jiang Yue looked at Matriarch Gu in disbelief. She had not expected Matriarch Gu to say such ugly words in public. If other people heard her words, she would live in ridicule for the rest of her life.

Jiang Yue’s eyes turned red, and her tears began falling uncontrollably. “Grandma, how can you say that about me? I’m your granddaughter. In the past, you had always made gowns for me. How would I have known that you would suddenly make a gown for Sister Nian Nian this time round?”

Looking black as thunder, Matriarch Gu said, “So you’re also aware of how many gowns I’ve made for you. This time, I made just the one for Nian Nian. Do you have to cry so bitterly?”

Jiang Yue raised her hand to her face and wiped her tears.

The more Matriarch Gu thought about it, the angrier she became. She continued, “Moreover, I was also worried that you would feel unhappy, so I specially invited Mr. S to design a gown tailored for you. Last night, I even added embroidery to your gown by hand. That gown is also a token of my goodwill. Where did that gown go?” At this moment, Zhao Qian walked over with two servants and handed over the unopened box containing the gown. “It’s here.”

Matriarch Gu was so irate that she began panting heavily. Frowning, she said, “You didn’t even open it to take a look?”

“Grandma, it’s not like that. I thought that one wasn’t mine.”

“Is that so?” Matriarch Gu looked at Jiang Yue coldly and asked, “How do you not know what your size is? This gown is clearly too small for you. It’s obvious that only Nian Nian can fit into this gown. Look at you!”

The last bit of blood drained from Jiang Yue’s face. She turned paler and paler.

Matriarch Gu grew angrier and angrier as she spoke. She shouted furiously, “Why are you standing there like a fool? Take off the gown now and return it to Nian Nian!”

Jiang Yue looked at Matriarch Gu in disbelief. She had never expected Matriarch Gu to ask her to take off her gown right now.

With teary eyes, Jiang Yue said pitifully, “Grandma, I’ve already put on this gown. How can I take it off now? Do you mean to ruin my reputation in school? I’ll never be able to have a foothold here again if I do as you ask.”

Seeing Matriarch Gu’s cold expression, Jiang Yue said pleadingly, “Grandma, I’m about to go on stage to give my speech. Can I change into the other gown after the speech?”

At this moment, Qiao Nian walked over from the podium.

This was the first time Qiao Nian had seen Matriarch Gu lose her temper. She hurriedly consoled her, “Grandma, don’t be angry. This isn’t good for your health.”

When Matriarch Gu saw Qiao Nian, she hurriedly grabbed her hand and said guiltily, “Nian Nian, it’s all Grandma’s fault. If I had asked you to leave the house in your gown today, this wouldn’t have happened. Jiang Yue is too bold. I can’t believe that she did such a thing.”

The onlookers were all stunned.

“Jiang Yue is really wearing Professor Qiao’s 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

gown!”

“Did you guys realize that Matriarch Gu seems to like Professor Qiao more?”

“Matriarch Gu seems to be apologizing on behalf of Jiang Yue. In that case, Matriarch Gu must really love both of them. The two of them should be equally important to Matriarch Gu.”
