1061 Do You Even Want Your Life?

Gu Zhou looked up at Bai Hui and said calmly, “My wife just likes to tell the truth.”

“Are you willing to risk your life for such a person?” Bai Hui questioned coldly. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Gu Zhou was already used to Bai Hui’s questioning. Ever since he was young, Bai Hui had always spoken in this tone. She had never seemed to have thought that he was her child.

At this moment, Yu Chu was looking at Bai Hui and Gu Zhou nervously. Her hands clenched involuntarily in front of her. Just as she was thinking about how to persuade her teacher and Brother Ah Zhou, she heard Qiao Nian speak.

“Madam Bai, if the truth makes you feel that it’s ear-piercing, there’s nothing we can do. After all, you’ve already done everything. You can’t make the entire world shut up!”

Bai Hui glared fiercely at Qiao Nian.

Gu Zhou shielded Qiao Nian behind him and asked, “Did she say anything wrong?”

Bai Hui looked at Gu Zhou. In a daze, she seemed to see Gu Zhou’s father. Gu Zhou looked very similar to his father, but Gu Zhou’s temper was similar to Gu Yue’s.

She recalled what Yu Chu had said previously.

Perhaps they had really grown up.

They were no longer under her control and had even learned to talk back.

In the past, no matter how obedient they were, they would do whatever she said. Even if they had an argument, she had the final say.

But now…

Bai Hui lowered her gaze, her eyes filled with sorrow.

Seeing that Bai Hui was silent, Gu Zhou knew that she was thinking of his brother again.

In her heart, her brother was the most important. The others were all nothing. They could come and go as they pleased.

Gu Zhou was very dissatisfied. He frowned and said, “I won’t compromise on matters of the heart. Qiao Nian is already my legal wife, and she will be my only wife. I have to have her in this life. Don’t do anything pointless again!”

Oh my god!

Brother Ah Zhou was so handsome!

Yu Chu was so excited that tears were about to fall.

Brother Ah Zhou doted on Second Sister-in-law so much. Second Sister-in-law was also so handsome. She dared to protect Brother Ah Zhou in front of her teacher!

Was this like how a President would dote on his wife?

Ah!

This was it!

Yu Chu looked at Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian with sparkling eyes. Suddenly, she sensed the coldness around her intensify. She saw her teacher looking at Brother Ah Zhou and Second Sister-in-law with a dark expression.

Her teacher was angry.

“Teacher…”

Yu Chu wanted to persuade Bai Hui, but Gu Zhou interrupted her.

“We still have something on. We’ll leave first!”

With that, Gu Zhou took Qiao Nian’s hand and walked out. He wasn’t negotiating with Bai Hui anymore, but informing her.

Gu Zhou and Bai Hui brushed past each other.

Bai Hui felt as if she was about to lose something. Her heart was empty as she shouted, “Stop!”

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian had already walked to the door of the private room. When they heard Bai Hui’s voice, they stopped.

Gu Zhou frowned slightly, but he quickly regained his composure. He turned to look at Bai Hui and subconsciously shielded Qiao Nian behind him.

Qiao Nian noticed Gu Zhou’s a cheap shot, a cheap trick. She was a little touched.

Bai Hui did not turn back to look at Gu Zhou. She stood there calmly and said, “Even if Gu Zhou already has a child, you don’t care?”

Qiao Nian knew that Bai Hui was talking to her again. She said, “I’m the mother of the child.”

Bai Hui seemed to have heard the funniest joke in the world. She turned to look at Qiao Nian and said coldly, “The eldest daughter of the Lu family is actually willing to be someone’s stepmother. If this gets out, many people will probably be shocked!”

When Gu Zhou heard Bai Hui’s words, he frowned.

Qiao Nian smiled gently and said, “Madam Bai, I think you’ve misunderstood. That child was born to Gu Zhou and me.”

Bai Hui’s expression changed slightly, but she quickly regained her composure. She asked with interest, “Pregnant before marriage? That’s all the upbringing the Lu family has?”

Just as Qiao Nian was about to speak, she heard Bai Hui say, “You can marry anyone you want, but you can’t marry the daughter of the Lu family. I won’t allow it.”

Gu Zhou said lightly, “I think you’ve forgotten. This is my business. It has nothing to do with you.”

When Bai Hui met Gu Zhou’s cold eyes, her heart skipped a beat. She had a bad feeling about this, but she quickly regained her composure. “Your grandmother isn’t in good health. Take the time to visit her.”

After a pause, Bai Hui continued, “Take the child with you.”

Bai Hui’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face, her gaze cold.
