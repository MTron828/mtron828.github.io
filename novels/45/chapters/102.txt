Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

At the incessant urging of Qiao Shan and Su Xue, Qiao Xin told them all about her trip to the mental hospital.

This time, it was Qiao Shan and Su Xue’s turn to be dumbfounded. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Is that really true?” Su Xue asked hesitantly.

Qiao Xin nodded and said, “Mom, why would I lie to you? There’s still a lot of greenery in the courtyard where Qiao Nian lived! Mom, tell me, how would Qiao Nian know how to cultivate Suranne Grass?”

Qiao Shan sat on a stone stool nearby and said thoughtfully, “Are you sure it was Qiao Nian who planted it?”

Qiao Xin nodded. “Qiao Nian’s attending doctor said so.”

“Then, this matter will be easier to handle.” The corner of Qiao Shan’s lips raised as a peculiar light flickered in his eyes.

Qiao Xin looked at Qiao Shan in confusion, not understanding what Qiao Shan meant. “Dad, what are you saying?”

Seeing Qiao Xin like this, Su Xue couldn’t help but explain with a smile, “Silly child, you don’t understand. She’s your sister, and she’s a member of the Qiao family. The things she owns will naturally belong to the Qiao family.”

Qiao Xin looked at Su Xue in surprise and said doubtfully, “Mom, are we going to be rich?”

Su Xue gave Qiao Xin an affirmative look.

Qiao Xin couldn’t help but smile. She said triumphantly, “That’s great! Then I can buy what I like!”

Su Xue’s smile grew a touch more reckless. “Our Qiao family has never been very high up on the social ladder. Since Qiao Nian is so capable, then our family will no longer be afraid of being bullied!”

Qiao Shan nodded. At this moment, he suddenly felt that Qiao Nian was quite pleasing to the eye. “Little Xin, do you remember how many pots of Suranne Grass there were in the mental hospital?”

Qiao Xin thought for a while, then said, “At the mental hospital, the nurses moved about seven or eight pots away. There were still many potted plants in the courtyard. I don’t know if there’s any left.”

“You’re saying that she cultivated a lot of greenery?” Qiao Shan asked eagerly.

“Yes, about 200 square meters’ worth, but I didn’t recognize any of those plants,” Qiao Xin said.

Qiao Shan turned to look at Su Xue and said, “Hurry up and go to the hospital to take a look. She might have planted many expensive medicinal herbs. Move them all home!”

Su Xue nodded.

Qiao Xin, who was standing at the side, said approvingly, “Father, you have to get back the Suranne Grass that Qiao Nian moved to the Gu residence. That’s the treasure of our Qiao family. How can you let Gu Zhou have it so easily?”

Qiao Shan nodded in agreement. “That’s right. That belongs to our Qiao family. This traitorous wretch is truly too shameless!”

Suddenly, there was the sound of clapping. The few of them looked over and saw Qiao Nian standing not far away.

“Marvelous. Truly amazing!” Qiao Nian looked at the three of them with a sarcastic expression. This was the first time she had seen anyone with such thick skin. She was so disgusted that she felt like vomiting.

Seeing Qiao Nian walk over, Su Xue subconsciously stood in front of the pot of Suranne Grass, blocking Qiao Nian’s line of sight.

Qiao Xin clenched her fists nervously and looked at Qiao Nian, her expression wary.

Now that Qiao Nian was the principal of An University, if she wanted to graduate successfully, she would have to get Qiao Nian’s approval. Hence, she had no choice but to tuck her tail between her legs.

Qiao Shan remained calm and composed. Sitting on the spot, he put on the airs of the head of the family. “Qiao Nian, you’re back. This is good timing. I have something to tell you!”

“Sure, but you have to return the Suranne Grass to me first!” Qiao Nian couldn’t even be bothered to greet Qiao Shan as her “father”. Her voice was cold.

‘When Su Xue heard Qiao Nian’s words, she immediately jumped out and said impatiently, “What are you saying? The Suranne Grass belongs to the Qiao family. How dare you mention it now? If you get your hands on anything good, shouldn’t you know to bring it home?”

“Why would I be embarrassed to mention it?” Qiao Nian raised her eyebrows and her gaze fell on Qiao Xin, who was standing next to Su Xue. “Qiao Xin is a thief. She stole my things. Why can’t I mention it?”

Qiao Nian simply couldn’t understand what the three of them were thinking.

Qiao Xin had been born after Su Xue had spent ten agonizing months pregnant. Now, according to Qiao Nian, Qiao Xin was a thief. Su Xue rebuked angrily, “What nonsense are you talking about? Qiao Xin just went to the hospital to take back some things of the family.. How can you say that she stole

anything of yours?”
