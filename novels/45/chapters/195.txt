Chapter 196: Betrayal

Qiu Nan had never expected to be labeled as someone with a fetish. He pursed his lips slightly. If word got out that he was into sadomasochism, his friends would all see him through a different lens. His career as a fitness instructor would be ruined!

When Qiu Nan thought of how Su Xue had just pushed him out to take the blame, his expression darkened. He had to make Su Xue pay with her life!

With this thought in mind, Qiu Nan was about to speak when he suddenly sensed Qiao Yu’s cold gaze on him. His gaze faltered. It was as though if he denied the allegations against him, he would never have a good life again.

At this moment, Qiu Nan’s mind was racing. The Qiao family was a big family. If Qiao Shan really went to prison because of him, the Qiao family would definitely not let him off.

In comparison to being laughed at by his friends, he was more afraid that the Qiao family would take revenge on him. At the thought of this, Qiao Shan could only sigh and prepare to agree.

“Mr. Qiu,” Gu Zhou spoke languidly, “your testimony is very important. If you lie, then you’ll be committing the crime of withholding evidence and shielding a criminal. You have to think this through carefully. Would I make a report without evidence?”

Qiu Nan’s mind went blank.

Gu Zhou had actually recorded everything. Qiu Nan couldn’t believe it.

Even if he stood on Su Xue’s side now, he would be in even greater trouble once Gu Zhou produced the evidence.

What should he do now?

He could not afford to offend the Qiao family, but he could not afford to offend Gu Zhou either.

Qiao Yu looked at Gu Zhou with a complicated expression.

Qiao Nian seemed to be displeased that Qiu Nan was refusing to respond. It was as though he was pretending to be deaf and mute. Smiling, she reminded him, “You’d better think carefully about some things. To be honest, you’re just a victim. If you don’t tell the truth, you and Qiao Shan will both go to jail. With you by his side, I’m sure Mr. Qiao won’t be lonely anymore.”

When Qiu Nan heard Qiao Nian’s words, he could see himself being beaten up by Qiao Shan in prison. He couldn’t help but shiver.

In fact, he didn’t want to be labeled as a sadomasochist either, so he chose to tell the truth. “Officer, Qiao Shan was the one who beat me up! The moment Qiao Shan entered, he gave Su Xue and me a beating. At that time, I thought that Su Xue and he hadn’t gotten a divorce, so I didn’t dare to resist. However, now that I know that Qiao Shan and Su Xue have already gotten a divorce, I’m puzzled. Since they’re divorced, why should Qiao Shan care if his ex-wife is in a relationship? Oh dear, it hurts so much. I have to go to the hospital to get my injuries examined. Please call the ambulance. I can no longer move!”

Qiu Nan was well-deserving of his fitness instructor title. He had always relied on his glib tongue to attract customers to purchase memberships, so at this moment, he was fully utilizing his strengths.

When Qiao Shan heard Qiu Nan’s words, he stepped back into the room in a rage. He wanted to attack Qiu Nan, but was stopped by the police.

Qiao Shan gritted his teeth in anger. He glared fiercely at Su Xue and cursed, “Look at you. What kind of lover have you found? Who does he think he is?!”

What made Qiao Shan the angriest was that he was clearly the victim, yet he had to bear the blame. He had to be taken to the police station for assault!

Qiao Shan felt that even eating shit wasn’t as disgusting as this.

In a rage, Qiao Shan began to cough violently!

Su Xue looked at Qiu Nan with resentment written all over her face. She had never expected this obedient little puppy, who usually obeyed her every command, to be so shameless.

Qiao Yu narrowed his eyes and looked at Qiu Nan dangerously, remaining silent.

Qiao Nian, who was standing at the side, pursed her lips. The smile in her eyes grew brighter and brighter. She said in a considerate manner, “Dad, Mom has already divorced you. No matter what kind of person her boyfriend is, you shouldn’t have stepped in. Although you won the physical fight, you’ll be sent to prison. It’s really not worth it.”

The police officer standing at the side nodded in agreement and said, “Mr. Qiao, this young lady is right. Since you’re already divorced, don’t bother yourself with other people’s affairs. Let’s go. Come to the police station with us now.”

Qiao Shan felt dizzy.
