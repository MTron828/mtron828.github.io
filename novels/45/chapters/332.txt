Chapter 333: Teasing

Brother Cao’s fragile heart instantly shattered. Lu Nian was depriving him of time to interact with the future big shots of music.

However, what surprised Brother Cao was that this was the first time Lu Nian had canceled the banquet!

Just because of Qiao Nian’s words.

Lu Nian was too abnormal.

When Qiao Nian heard this, she couldn’t help but smile. Her mood instantly improved and she said sweetly, “Thank you, Brother!”

She seemed to have called him brother many times. It was intimate, natural, and a little playful.

Seeing Qiao Nian like this, Lu Nian couldn’t help but laugh.

Brother Cao’s heart began to race. At this moment, he was in a mess.

Brother Cao hurriedly pulled Lu Nian to another room and closed the door warily. He asked mercilessly, “What exactly do you mean?”

Lu Nian was slightly stunned. He asked, “What do you mean?”

Brother Cao’s expression darkened. “What exactly do you want from Qiao Nian?”

“What can I want?”

When Brother Cao heard Lu Nian’s words, he almost exploded on the spot. He tried hard to calm himself down and took a deep breath. With a serious expression, he said, “Do you know that Qiao Nian is the Second Young Madam of the Gu family? You’re very close to Young Master Gu. How can you steal his woman? Aren’t you afraid of being punished by the heavens???”

Seeing Brother Cao’s exasperation, a trace of mockery flashed in Lu Nian’s eyes. He shrugged and asked casually, “What’s wrong with that?”

“Lu Nian, are you crazy? She’s married! Married! Married!” Brother Cao was so angry that he was about to go crazy. He really didn’t expect Lu Nian to have such thoughts.

“She can still get a divorce after she gets married, right?” Lu Nian asked.

Brother Cao was about to explode in anger. Speechless, he said, “You’re Mr. Dong Hua, and you’re a musician. If the scandal of you seducing a married woman gets exposed, what will happen after your fans commit suicide?”

Seeing Brother Cao like this, Lu Nian finally laid his cards on the table. “Alright, tell the truth!”

When Brother Cao heard Lu Nian’s words, he sighed helplessly. He raised his hand to his forehead, worried that he would die from a cerebral hemorrhage.

Lu Nian walked out of the room and looked at Qiao Nian, who was lying on the sofa. She seemed to have fallen asleep. His lips curved up slightly as he asked, “Don’t you think she’s more suitable to be my sister than Song Yu?”

When Brother Cao heard Lu Nian’s words, he looked up into his eyes.

His eyes were filled with affection and pure admiration.

But this kind of look was definitely not romantic.

In that instant, Brother Cao understood that Lu Nian wanted to be her older brother.

The staff backstage were still busy, making ear-piercing noises from time to time.

Lying on the sofa, Qiao Nian frowned slightly. She turned around and fell asleep again.

Lu Nian knew very well that Qiao Nian wasn’t so tired because of this concert, but because of her preparations.

It was not easy for her to practice many songs in two days and familiarize herself with the music. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Qiao Nian had been extremely tense the entire time. The dark circles under her eyes seemed to indicate that she hadn’t slept the entire night.

Lu Nian waved at everyone, signaling for them to stop making noise and disturb Qiao Nian’s rest.

The staff hurriedly nodded and left.

Lu Nian walked to the sofa and was about to cover Qiao Nian with a small blanket when footsteps came from the door.

Lu Nian turned around and saw Gu Zhou walking in indifferently.

Gu Zhou walked over to the sofa and took off his suit jacket, carefully covering Qiao Nian with it.

Qiao Nian, who had been sleeping, smelled the faint fragrance. She moved slightly and gripped her suit jacket tightly. This fragrance seemed to have a calming effect, and she slept even more comfortably.

This time, she dreamed again.

In her dream, she seemed to be a little girl being carried by a young man in white.
