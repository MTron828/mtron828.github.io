979 Don’t Be Impulsive!

However, before Lu Qi could heave a sigh of relief, she saw Qiao Nian walking towards her with a cold expression.

Oh my god!

Sister Qiao Nian, you should call my brother quickly. Don’t be rash!

Lu Qi was shouting in her heart, but Qiao Nian didn’t seem to hear her inner monologue at all. She walked up to Lu Qi step by step.

At this moment, He Cheng’s back was facing Qiao Nian, so he didn’t see her.

Lu Qi’s heart was in her throat. In order not to let He Cheng pay attention to Qiao Nian, she smiled at He Cheng and asked, “Brother Cheng, you haven’t told me what kind of girl you like. I’ll help you keep an eye out!”

Seeing that Lu Qi seemed to be sincerely introducing a girlfriend to him, He Cheng glanced at Lu Qi. Although Lu Qi was not bad-looking, she was not his type.

At this moment, Qiao Nian’s appearance at the bar in a red dress flashed across He Cheng’s mind. At that time, his attention was all on Qiao Nian!

Qiao Nian was like a beautiful snake, making one involuntarily want to approach her.

“I like… Ah!”

He Cheng felt a pain in his butt and fell to the ground uncontrollably.

Seeing this, Lu Qi hurriedly turned around to avoid her fate of being kidnapped.

He Cheng immediately stood up. When he turned around, he saw Qiao Nian standing not far away. His eyes turned cold, and he reached out to grab Lu Qi as a hostage.

However, Qiao Nian was one step faster. She shielded Lu Qi behind her and looked at He Cheng coldly. “Mr. He, it’s not even the new year yet. Who are you kowtowing to?”

Lu Qi’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s hand, which was holding hers. She recalled the power of Qiao Nian’s kick just now and couldn’t help but smile. She followed Qiao Nian’s hand and saw Qiao Nian’s perfect side profile.

Lu Qi’s heart skipped a beat. She stared blankly at Qiao Nian.

In the past, she had always been protected by her brother and bodyguards. This was the first time she had been protected by a girl. If she were a man, she would definitely fall in love with Sister Qiao Nian.

Actually, that wasn’t right either. She was a girl, but she could still fall in love with Sister Qiao Nian. Nowadays, many girls were with girls.

He Cheng had always valued his reputation the most. That day, he had been humiliated by Fourth Master, and now by Qiao Nian. His face instantly darkened, and his eyes turned red with anger. He took out a dagger from his pocket!

“Sister Nian Nian, run!” Lu Qi’s face turned pale in fear. She pulled Qiao Nian back, but Qiao Nian shook her hand off.

He Cheng gripped the dagger in his hand tightly, his eyes filled with hatred. “Since you want to die, I’ll fulfill your wish!”

Seeing He Cheng charge at Qiao Nian with a knife, Lu Qi ran up to Qiao Nian without thinking, wanting to help her block the knife.

Qiao Nian took a step forward and rushed up to He Cheng. She grabbed He Cheng’s hand, which was holding the knife, and exerted a little strength. With a crack, He Cheng’s hand was dislocated. The knife in his hand fell to the ground like autumn leaves.

“Ah!” He Cheng’s face was pale from the pain. He looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief. After Qiao Nian let go of his hand, he took a few steps back in fear.

Lu Qi was also stunned. She looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief. There really was a beautiful and valiant girl in this world. She couldn’t help but gasp.

Oh my god!

She swore that Sister Qiao Nian would be her idol from now on!

He Cheng steadied himself and looked at Qiao Nian resentfully. Qiao Nian looked like a vase. How could she be so strong?

Qiao Nian looked at He Cheng with disgust and coldness. She said coldly, “If you appear beside Lu Qi again, I don’t mind making you a eunuch!”

He Cheng covered his aching hand and looked at his lower body with trembling eyes.

He had a feeling that Qiao Nian would definitely do such a thing!

On what basis?

He was a man. He should be strong and not be threatened by a woman!

“What are you looking at? Get lost!” Qiao Nian said sternly.

With that, Qiao Nian walked towards He Cheng in her high heels.

The moment He Cheng saw Qiao Nian’s face, he subconsciously recalled the pain of his dislocated wrist. He retreated instinctively! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

At this moment, Qiao Nian was like a demon from hell. She exuded a cold aura, making one shiver.

He Cheng was so frightened by Qiao Nian that his legs were trembling!
