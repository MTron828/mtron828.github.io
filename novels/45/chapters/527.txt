Chapter 528: Headache

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

However, from Qiao Nian’s tone, it seemed that something else had happened.

“Last night, what exactly happened?”

Hearing Gu Zhou’s question, Qiao Nian’s expression turned serious. She sat up and explained calmly, “Last night, there was a thunderstorm. Chen Qing called and told me that you suddenly felt sick and ran out. I went out to look for you. When I found you, I brought you back.”

At this point, Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion, as if she didn’t understand why Gu Zhou was asking this. “Don’t you remember?”

Gu Zhou lowered his head slightly and frowned, trying hard to recall what had happened.

Then, he felt a headache. Of course, it was as if he had been pricked by countless needles. Sweat instantly seeped out of his forehead.

Seeing him like this, Qiao Nian’s expression changed slightly. She hurriedly held Gu Zhou’s hand and said anxiously, “Don’t think about it anymore. If you can’t remember those things, it doesn’t matter. After all, these things aren’t important.”

Gu Zhou raised his hand and massaged his temples. His head still hurt.

Seeing Gu Zhou like this, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but worry. She knelt down beside Gu Zhou and removed his hand, gently massaging his temples. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Gu Zhou, if you’re not feeling well, don’t force yourself. Relax and breathe slowly.”

Gu Zhou listened to Qiao Nian’s gentle voice. His eyes were filled with worry, and he could feel the gentleness in her hands.

She massaged his temples. The headache had eased a lot.

Suddenly, a blurry image appeared in his mind. He stared at Qiao Nian intently, his eyes burning. He asked, “Why did you hug me when you were sleeping?”

Qiao Nian, who was massaging Gu Zhou’s temples, looked at his eyes in surprise. His eyes were filled with confusion.

She had a bad feeling and quickly withdrew her hand.

“Yes?”

There was a trace of scrutiny in the man’s voice.

It was obvious that Gu Zhou wanted to get to the bottom of this.

Qiao Nian frowned and stared intently into Gu Zhou’s eyes. She asked, “Do you remember anything?”

Gu Zhou only looked at Qiao Nian calmly. In the memories he had just recalled, her back was facing him.

At that time, her hand was on his waist. Her hand was soft and warm. When she placed it on his waist, he felt warm all over.

Later on, her grip seemed to tighten, as if she wanted to melt him into her body.

He had never seen Qiao Nian like this before.

She had no idea that Qiao Nian would do such a thing.

He could still feel the warmth and softness of Qiao Nian’s arms around him. His throat moved slightly, and his voice was sexy and low. “Huh? Why did you take the initiative to hug me last night?”

Qiao Nian was speechless.

Could it be that Gu Zhou had already remembered everything?

That didn’t seem right either.

She didn’t seem to have taken the initiative to hug him!

Could it be that Gu Zhou only remembered a little bit?

Really, when had she ever taken the initiative to hug him? Her hands were clearly stiff with nerves.

Qiao Nian’s breathing became increasingly irregular. She tried her best to regulate her breathing. After a long while, she said, “I… I didn’t!”

“You didn’t?”

Clearly, Gu Zhou didn’t believe Qiao Nian.

He approached Qiao Nian slightly.

Qiao Nian instantly felt a sense of oppression. Instinctively, she moved back and said sincerely, “I really didn’t take the initiative to hug you. When I found you last night, you were drenched and had a slight fever. When we were sleeping, you insisted that I hug you. Don’t you remember?”

Gu Zhou’s phoenix-like eyes narrowed slightly, as if he still doubted Qiao Nian’s words. “Did I ask you to hug me?”
