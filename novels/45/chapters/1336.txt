1337 Missing You

After a long while, Qiao Nian let go of them and looked down at the two children in her arms. She asked softly, “You look a little thin. Have you not eaten well in the past two days?”

Xiao Shi looked up at Qiao Nian with a sweet smile on her face. She said seriously, “Mommy, I miss you so much, so I didn’t eat much.”

Qiao Nian’s heart trembled violently. She had no choice but to go on a long trip this time.

Xiao Shi’s words made Qiao Nian realize that the children couldn’t leave her yet. It was better for her to spend more time with them.

She looked at Gu Qi. Gu Qi didn’t like to speak when there were many people, but she could feel the happiness in his eyes.

Xiao Shi turned to look at Gu Qi, then smiled sweetly at Qiao Nian. “Brother too.”

“Mommy missed you so much when she was out.” Qiao Nian patted the two children’s heads gently, her eyes filled with smiles. “That’s why I came back as soon as possible.”

Xiao Shi’s eyes sparkled as she said happily, “Xiao Shi and Brother not only miss Mommy, but we also miss Daddy. We haven’t slept well for the past two days. After moving into Grandma’s house, Brother and I couldn’t sleep.”

Xiao Shi told Qiao Nian in detail about her and Gu Qi excitedly. “Brother and I were both thinking about when Mommy and Daddy would be home. I didn’t expect to see Mommy today. I’m so happy.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Xiao Shi happily told Qiao Nian about how she had played a game for a while and did her homework. She even told her about her useless teammate in the game. She seemed to have endless things to say to Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian listened to Xiao Shi’s words with a smile. She wasn’t impatient at all.

Xiao Shi spoke for a while and stopped when she felt a little thirsty.

Smiling, Qiao Nian patted the heads of the two children and asked gently, “Then do you want to sleep with Mommy tonight?”

Sleep with Mommy!

Xiao Shi’s obsidian pupils gradually dilated, and her lips curved up slowly. She hurriedly nodded, afraid that Qiao Nian would go back on her word in the next moment. “Mommy, you’re the best mommy in the world!”

With that, Xiao Shi moved closer to Qiao Nian and kissed her cheek. She cheered on the spot.

Gu Qi pursed his lips and nodded, his ears turning red

Bai Hui walked out of the house and looked at the two children with sparkling eyes. Her heart seemed to be gripped tightly, and it was so painful that it was difficult to breathe.

Bai Hui recalled the situation when Gu Yue and Gu Zhou were young. Those two children were not fond of smiling, just like Gu Qi. However, even if Gu Qi pursed his lips, she could tell that he was smiling.

It turned out that it wasn’t that her two children couldn’t smile, but that she didn’t let her children’s faces be filled with happy smiles.

Yu Chu walked over with the two children. Halfway through, the two children ran straight into Qiao Nian’s arms. For the entire day, she had accompanied both children with her, but they both had their heads down and didn’t speak.

Now, it seemed that it wasn’t that these two children had bad personalities, but that the two of them would only smile genuinely happy in front of their mother.

Yu Chu recalled her childhood. She lived in a family that valued boys over girls. Her parents didn’t value her at all. She had always hoped to be doted on by her parents.

She had waited for more than ten years. When her parents treated her gently, she was very happy. However, in the next moment, her parents’ words threw her into the abyss.

Her parents wanted her to get married as soon as possible and earn some dowry money. They were still counting on her dowry money to help her brother get married.

Fortunately, her teacher had pulled her out of the abyss.

Her teacher was a good person. She was very grateful to her teacher. She hoped that her teacher’s family could be harmonious, and she hoped that her teacher would understand that the happiness of a child was the most important.

After Xiao Shi was overjoyed, she took Qiao Nian’s arm and began to talk about her homework. She almost wanted to tell Qiao Nian everything about what she had done.

Just as her mouth was dry, a hand suddenly appeared beside her, holding a teacup.

Xiao Shi looked up and noticed that the person standing beside her mommy was Lu Zhu.

“Have some water,” Lu Zhu said gently.

A sweet smile appeared on Xiao Shi’s face. She tilted her head and called out, “Eldest Uncle! Thank you, Eldest Uncle!”
