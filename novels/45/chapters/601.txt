Chapter 602: Sweetheart

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“What?” Lu Nian frowned slightly and asked in confusion, “Are you telling me that you plan to meet Tang Rou today?”

Tang Rou was the blind date Grandma Lu had introduced to Lu Nian. The two of them had met a few times.

“It’s nothing,” Lu Zhu said indifferently. He only felt that the name Tang Rou sounded familiar, but he couldn’t remember who it was.

“Or does Brother want to reject Grandma’s good intentions and fall in love freely, hmm?” Lu Nian’s voice rose slightly as he asked casually.

“What?” Lu Zhu’s frown deepened.

“Brother, you don’t have to hide it anymore. You’re so seriously injured, but you still insisted on going out today. Aren’t you going to meet your sweetheart? What else can you do?” Lu Nian asked casually. His eyes narrowed with a smile, but his gaze was fixed on Lu Zhu’s eyes.

Lu Zhu walked out and said coldly, “Third Brother has just returned, and you’ve already learned to gossip?”

Lu Nian followed and reached out to support Lu Zhu. He said tentatively, “How can I be gossipy when I’m concerned about my brother’s marriage? I think your attitude towards Qiao Nian is very special. Very different.”

“Huh?” Lu Zhu turned to look at Lu Nian. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Brother, you’re not the only one who thinks this way. Gu Zhou would think so too.” Young Lu smiled and said, “Just now, Gu Zhou called me and said that he was concerned about your health.”

Lu Zhu stopped in his tracks and frowned. He turned to look at Lu Nian. “What else did you say?”

“I think he wants to confirm something.” The smile on Lu Nian’s face gradually disappeared as he said solemnly.

Lu Zhu lowered his gaze.

Was Gu Zhou being too suspicious?

Sugar had only gone out for a while, yet Gu Zhou wanted to confirm this matter.

How odd.

Lu Zhu looked up at Lu Nian and saw the scrutiny in his eyes. He instantly understood.

Lu Nian definitely didn’t know that Qiao Nian was Sugar. If he knew, he wouldn’t have called Qiao Nian “Sister Nian”, let alone think that he had an unspeakable relationship with Qiao Nian.

Seeing Lu Zhu’s heavy expression, Lu Nian frowned and asked, “Don’t tell me you have other thoughts about Sister Nian?”

Lu Zhu frowned and said helplessly, “What kind of nonsense is in your head? How can you write a good song like this? When you get back, you should go to the ancestral hall first. You can write a song later.”

In Lu Nian’s eyes, his words were an excuse. Lu Nian’s beautiful thin lips curved up slightly, and he said seriously, “Brother, you can’t be the third party in destroying someone else’s family, let alone my Second Brother’s family!”

Lu Zhu’s chest tightened. He was in a mess.

Previously, when Ah Rao wanted to pursue Qiao Nian, he had even warned Ah Rao not to have any designs on Qiao Nian.

What goes around comes around. It had only been a few days, but it was Ah Nian’s turn to warn him.

What was going on?

Lu Zhu raised his hand and adjusted his glasses. He asked calmly, “When did you acknowledge her as your sister? Why didn’t I know?”

“During the concert.”

Lu Zhu was speechless.

Unexpectedly, Sugar called him Brother Ah Nian.

Her heart sank even further.

“Let’s go home.” Lu Zhu no longer wanted to say anything.

Lu Nian looked at Lu Zhu in confusion. His brother’s mood was fluctuating. Had he really fallen for Qiao Nian?

His beautiful phoenix-like eyes gradually narrowed. It seemed that he had to keep an eye on his brother in the future.

After Lu Zhu calmed down, he turned to look at Lu Nian and said gently, “Don’t let your imagination run wild. I won’t do anything rash either. Go and prepare for your new song launch. Sister is still waiting for your new song.”

When Lu Nian heard this, the light in his eyes gradually dimmed. He sighed helplessly.

This time, his new song was specially prepared for Sugar.

Unfortunately, Sugar would never hear his music again.

The anniversary of Sugar’s death was approaching again.

He thought of his sister and felt even worse. All he wanted to do was hold a concert to commemorate Sugar. He didn’t know if Sugar would still be able to hear him. “Do you think Sugar has already been reincarnated?”

Lu Zhu pursed his lips and glanced to the side indifferently. “I don’t think so. Get ready. There might be other surprises.”
