Seeing how hard Qiao Xin was crying, Su Yan’s heart ached for her. He hurriedly pulled Qiao Xin into his embrace and comforted her gently. “Don’t cry. Don’t be sad. I believe you. Qiao Nian has treated you so badly. Just don’t take her to be your sister in the future!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Xin sobbed her heart out, looking a pitiful sight. She looked up at Su Yan and spoke, her voice choked with emotion. “Brother Su Yan, it’s all my fault. I wanted to help you, but I didn’t expect things to turn out like this…”

Seeing the state Qiao Xin was in, Su Yan glared viciously at Qiao Nian. He hadn’t expected that Qiao Nian would bully her younger sister like this all the time!

The more Su Yan thought about it, the angrier he became. For his sake, Qiao Xin had taken the initiative to give him the Suranne Grass. She had gone to such lengths just to allow him to secure the opportunity for collaboration with Director Lin.

But this stupid woman, Qiao Nian, had come to cause trouble yet again. And this brainless fool still wanted to be with him! She must be dreaming!

Su Yan’s expression darkened. “Since no one welcomes us here, we’ll take our leave!”

With that, Su Yan began to help Qiao Xin out of the room.

“Haha.”

At this moment, Qiao Nian began to laugh. Her voice was dripping with sarcasm.

Su Yan stopped in his tracks involuntarily. He turned back to look at Qiao Nian and questioned, “What are you laughing at? Don’t think that just because you bullied Qiao Xin, I’ll get together with you. In your dreams!”

Qiao Nian raised her eyebrow slightly, giving a bright smile. “Mr. Su, you’re wrong there. From the beginning, everyone has only targeted me. According to how Qiao Xin is acting right now, a few sharp words of criticism can be enough for one to fall into the depths of despair and yearn to end one’s life. In that case, shouldn’t I have already died a thousand times over?”

She refused to let Qiao Xin leave. She had to make Qiao Xin pay!

Su Yan frowned when he heard Qiao Nian’s words. His eyes were filled with coldness as he said impatiently,

“Are you saying that you want Qiao Xin to die a thousand times over? How can you be so vicious?”

“Is there something wrong with your brain? If so, I’m sure that there’s at least one neurosurgeon present today, among the big shots of the medical field who have been invited. Ask him to examine your brain, will you?” While speaking, Qiao Nian knocked lightly on her head and gave Su Yan a half-smile. “Or were you already aware that Qiao Xin was lying? Did you know from the start that this pot of Suranne Grass belongs to me?”

Su Yan’s face turned green with suppressed rage when he heard Qiao Nian’s words. He still remembered how gentle Qiao Nian had been in the past. Now that he thought about it, Qiao Nian seemed to have become a completely different person.

When Song Hua heard Qiao Nian’s words, he walked up in a rage, glaring fiercely at her. “You’re spouting nonsense. I know many big shots in the botanical field, but I’ve never heard of anyone cultivating plants according to the method you just described. Everything you’ve said so far is just a big joke!”

Song Hua was very well-known in the medical field. When the onlookers heard his words, they began to waver. One by one, they stood on Qiao Xin’s side.

“Qiao Nian must be the one who’s bullying Qiao Xin!”

“Although we’ve never studied how plants grow, everyone knows that most plants are cultivated with seeds. How could plants become a new breed after grafting?”

“Mr. Song is famous in the medical world. How could he wrongly accuse a young lady?”

At this moment, Director Lin’s assistant entered. There was a large group of people behind him, and everyone instinctively looked toward the door.

When everyone saw the parade of items behind Director Lin’s assistant, their jaws dropped!

Director Lin’s assistant was holding a pot of Suranne Grass. Not only that, every person behind him was each holding a pot of Suranne Grass.

Oh my god, there were five pots of Suranne Grass in total!

Everyone’s eyes had gone wide open in astonishment.

Was this Qiao Nian’s gift to Director Lin?

What everyone was seeing right now was no longer the Suranne Grass, but piles of glittering gold. All of them were so excited that they nearly fainted from the shock..
