868 Don’t Want to Be a Bad Child

When Xiao Shi heard Song Man’s words, she used all her strength to grab her hand and said seriously, “Mommy, I like Daddy a lot. I also want to get along very well with Daddy. However, if we stay in An City, it might ruin the relationship between Daddy and Auntie Nian Nian. That way, Brother will be very sad. I don’t want him to be sad!”

Xiao Shi said sincerely. She really wanted to return to South City.

However, Song Man was stunned.

After a long while, Song Man came back to her senses.

!!

Xiao Shi was just a five-year-old child. How did she know so much?

She lowered her gaze and said aggrievedly, “Do you really want to return to Nancheng and live a life without the next meal? Have you already forgotten what it feels like?”

Xiao Shi sniffled a little, and her tears fell uncontrollably. She shook her head. “Mommy, I’ve never forgotten when I lived in Nancheng. Although life was very hard, the two of us were very happy together. Moreover, Mommy didn’t have to be the bad person who ruined other people’s relationships!”

Song Man was stunned. Was this something a five-year-old child could understand?

Song Man swallowed and asked in disbelief, “You’re still young. You don’t even understand. Who told you these things?”

Xiao Shi raised her hand to wipe her tears and said pitifully, “Although I also hope that Daddy and Mommy can live happily together, I know that’s impossible. Daddy likes Auntie Nian Nian, and not only does Auntie Nian Nian treat Daddy well, but she also treats Brother very well. When I went to the Gu family yesterday, Daddy was very gentle and kind to me. He even helped me with my homework.”

“But when Daddy saw us this morning, he was angry with Auntie Nian Nian. He seemed to have become very terrifying. If we stay here, Daddy and Auntie Nian Nian might not be together.”

Song Man fell silent.

Song Man had long known that Xiao Shi was very smart and sensitive, but she did not expect her to notice so many things.

If only Xiao Shi was as stupid as other children.

That way, she could cry, throw a tantrum, and force Gu Zhou to marry her.

It was said that children’s eyes were the purest. Could it be that Gu Zhou had only flared up at Qiao Nian this morning because he had discovered her and Xiao Shi’s existence?

Qiao Nian hid the fact that she and Xiao Shi had come to An City.

Gu Zhou knew that Qiao Nian was hiding this matter, which was why he was so angry.

It seemed that Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian weren’t that close either.

The two of them were probably just pretending.

Xiao Shi wiped her tears, but more and more of them fell. She couldn’t wipe them away no matter what.

Xiao Shi thought of what had happened today. The more she thought about it, the sadder she became. She cried and said, “Mommy, I know why you asked me to call Daddy for dinner today. You just want to be with Daddy. If I do this, won’t I become a bad child? Good children will never ruin other people’s marriages. So what if Daddy comes today? He doesn’t care about Mommy at all. Then will Mommy still ask me to do these bad things in the future…”

Song Man was stunned. Was Xiao Shi really only five years old?

How could she have noticed so much? FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

She was really too smart.

Generally speaking, shouldn’t children want their daddy and mommy to be together?

Why was Xiao Shi different?

What puzzled her was that what Xiao Shi had just said was for the sake of others. Had Xiao Shi never thought about her own feelings?

Xiao Shi really didn’t yearn for a complete family.

Xiao Shi did not know what Song Man was thinking. She sniffled and continued crying, “If I don’t listen to Mommy once, will you still hit me? Every time Mommy hits me, you promise never to hit me again, but your promise has never come true. Mommy will always lose control and hit me again…”

When Song Man heard this, her expression instantly darkened. She said angrily, “Just because of this, you took more than half a bottle of sleeping pills and committed suicide?”

Xiao Shi looked at Song Man with teary eyes and shook her head. Her throat was burning with pain.
