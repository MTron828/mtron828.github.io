1320 Selfishness

However, Dao Wen disappointed him. Not only did Dao Wen not monitor Chen Quan, but he was also related to Gu Zhou’s woman, causing their plan to deal with the Gu family to fail.

Such a good opportunity had been wasted.

Cui Huai retracted his hand and said with a dark expression, “Dao Wen’s matter is a wake-up call for us. If our subordinates get married in the future, send them to do unimportant things, lest they fail the mission and cause us trouble.”

Chen Quan picked up the teacup on the coffee table and took a sip. Then, he placed the teacup back on the table and said calmly, “That’s indeed the case. People who are in love will more or less have some selfishness when they’re in a relationship. Actually, people more or less have selfishness. It just depends on whether that person can prioritize his career.”

When he said “selfish”, he emphasized it.

Cui Huai understood that Chen Quan was criticizing him indirectly, but he had been too rash tonight.

He pretended not to understand Chen Quan’s words and retracted his gaze to look at him.

When Chen Quan was young, he was handsome, suave, skilled, and smart. That was why he had promoted Chen Quan.

In the blink of an eye, ten years had passed. Chen Quan was no longer young. There were still many fine lines at the corners of his eyes. The high spirits of his youth gradually dissipated, and he was much more mature and steady than before.

Chen Quan lowered his gaze slightly. Chen Quan had been following him since he was twenty years old and had helped him deal with many dirty things. Other than him not being able to catch Gu Zhou, Chen Quan had done everything else.

However, Chen Quan usually looked calm. That was why he doubted Chen Quan and felt that he had selfish intentions.

Previously, when Dao Wen was by his side, he had said that Chen Quan often whispered to Chang Feng. They were even being very secretive, as if they didn’t want anyone else to hear them.

At that time, Chen Quan hadn’t caught Gu Zhou. He had never expected that his ace thugs wouldn’t be able to catch Gu Zhou. Hence, he believed Dao Wen and felt that Chen Quan was related to Gu Zhou.

But on second thought, it was fine for anyone in the world to work with Gu Zhou, but it was absolutely impossible for Chen Quan to work with Gu Zhou, because Gu Zhou would never work with Chen Quan.

Gu Yue had been killed by Chen Quan himself!

How could Gu Zhou work with his brother’s murderer?

It seemed that Chen Quan really hadn’t let Gu Zhou go on purpose back then.

Gu Zhou was much more cunning than his brother, Gu Yue. He really hadn’t expected Gu Zhou to be willing to let his woman seduce his people and make Dao Wen betray him.

If he listened to Dao Wen, although he could get rid of Chen Quan, who was a potential threat, the higher-ups might think that he was too weak and work with someone else. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Cui Huai frowned. He had watched Chen Quan grow up. There was no way Chen Quan was Gu Yue. “Chen Quan, there’s something I want to discuss with you.”

When Mr. Chen heard Cui Huai’s words, he knew that Cui Huai already trusted him completely. Moreover, Cui Huai felt very guilty now. With a faint smile on his face, he said, “Mr. Cui, just instruct me!”

Cui Huai looked at the smile on Chen Quan’s face and said, “I don’t feel well. I want to leave the company’s matters to you. I won’t ask more.”

Cui Huai said this to test what Chen Quan was thinking.

Was this Cui Huai’s apology gift to him?

Mr. Chen frowned and shook his head. He said disapprovingly, “Mr. Cui, that won’t do. I don’t know much about the company’s business. If you ask me to consider fighting and killing, I can do it. However, I definitely can’t do everything.”

After a pause, Mr. Chen continued, “Mr. Cui, everyone has something they’re good at. If you ask me to do something I’m not good at, the company will probably be ruined in a few days!”

Cui Huai stared unblinkingly at Chen Quan, as if he wanted to know if Chen Quan was telling the truth.

After a long while, he smiled and said, “You have a point. Professionals do professional things!”

As Cui Huai spoke, he smiled and patted Chen Quan’s shoulder. He had really gone senile. No matter how smart Chen Quan was, he was still an outstanding fighter.
