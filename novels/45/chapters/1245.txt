1246 Disappointment

It was precisely because he had seen too many poor old people that Boss Jin had the thought of building a nursing home.

Boss Jin had built more than a hundred nursing homes. Even if he had a bad temper, was uneducated and was lecherous, everyone would give him some face.

Boss Jin hated those who abused the elderly and did not support them the most in his life!

However, he had never expected the obedient Yue’er to bite the hand that fed her for her own selfish desires!

Boss Jin felt that he and Jiang Yue were together purely because of their relationship.

But now that he heard Qiao Nian’s words, Jiang Yue had no feelings for him at all, because the person Jiang Yue loved the most was Gu Zhou.

Boss Jin pushed Jiang Yue away and frowned at her. “Is that true?”

Jiang Yue had never expected Boss Jin to push her away. She knew very well that without Boss Jin’s support, she was nothing.

Jiang Yue looked at Boss Jin with teary eyes and said pitifully, “That’s not true at all. She’s lying. She wanted to harm Grandma herself. Grandma raised me herself. Grandma treats me very well. Why should I hurt Grandma? How can I bear to hurt Grandma?”

The more Jiang Yue spoke, the more aggrieved she felt. She raised her hand to wipe her tears and continued, “But no one believed me, and Grandma didn’t believe that I didn’t do that. Just like that, I was chased out!”

She sniffled and continued, “Qiao Nian has always been the one who’s jealous of me. Although Qiao Nian is a member of the Qiao family, she was raised in the countryside since she was young. She knows that I have no parents, and I heard that I grew up by Grandma’s side. She’s jealous that I had such a good childhood!”

Towards the end, Jiang Yue was already sobbing uncontrollably. “I really didn’t expect jealousy to be so terrifying. Qiao Nian, please let me off. Even if I have to apologize to you, okay?”

“You’ve already ruined my face. You’re jealous that I have a perfect family, and you’ve ruined my family. Now, do you still want to ruin my love?” Jiang Yue questioned loudly, crying.

Boss Jin looked at Jiang Yue and frowned. He thought that she didn’t seem to be lying. Qiao Nian didn’t seem to be lying either. What exactly was the truth?

“You’re still unrepentant. If you’re not a beast, what are you?” Gu Zhou said with a dark expression. “Grandma hasn’t become senile yet. She can tell right from wrong. Doesn’t she know who poisoned her?”

Boss Jin stood there in silence.

Although he liked Jiang Yue a lot and felt that there was love between him and her, he trusted Gu Zhou’s abilities more. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

According to Gu Zhou, Jiang Yue and Gu Zhou had grown up together. The two of them should be on good terms. Even if Jiang Yue had feelings for Gu Zhou, Gu Zhou would not slander her outside because of this.

Moreover, Gu Zhou was all-powerful in the business world. Many people said that Gu Zhou was very rational and more outstanding than his brother.

How could an outstanding and rational person like Gu Zhou not know about such a small matter?

At this moment, Boss Jin completely believed Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian’s words.

Boss Jin’s gaze fell on Jiang Yue’s face again.

This was really the first time he had been tempted, but he had never expected such an obedient and adorable Jiang Yue to be such a vicious person behind his back.

Seeing Boss Jin’s suspicious gaze, Jiang Yue quickly stepped forward and grabbed his hand. Her face turned pale as she said, “I’m really not lying about the matter. You have to believe me…”

Boss Jin’s gaze fell on Jiang Yue’s hand, which was holding his. He hesitated but did not brush it off.

He really liked Jiang Yue.

Naturally, Gu Zhou could tell that Boss Jin was hesitating. He interrupted Jiang Yue mercilessly. “Also, Nian’er didn’t ruin your face at all. When you were in the Lu family, you deliberately framed Nian’er. At that time, you placed sulfuric acid on the urn of the eldest daughter of the Lu family. The urn of the eldest daughter of the Lu family was corroded, which was why Lu Rao was angry and ruined your face. How dare you shamelessly blame Nian’er for this!”

“Has the urn of the eldest daughter of the Lu family been corroded?” Boss Jin asked with a frown.
