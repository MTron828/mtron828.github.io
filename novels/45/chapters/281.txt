Chapter 282: Stupid Teammate

Brother Cao shifted his gaze away from the girl. A young lady who was suitable for Mr. Dong Hua must be beautiful, kind, pure, and adorable. He had to think about it carefully later and work hard to get Mr. Dong Hua out of being single.

Brother Cao looked at Xia Xue. If Xia Xue hadn’t returned to the dormitory to change her clothes, he would have thought highly of her. “The ears of the public are sharp. Xia Xue, come and play. I believe in your talent and hard work. You must be better than a new student!”

For some reason, Brother Cao felt that there was something wrong with the way Lu Nian was looking at him.

Brother Cao’s body stiffened involuntarily. He no longer dared to breathe loudly.

What was going on?

What was Mr. Dong Hua trying to do?

Shouldn’t he teach Qiao Nian a lesson?

Brother Cao turned to look at Qiao Nian. He saw that the beautiful young lady was talking to a classmate beside her. The smile on her face made his heart race.

He could no longer stare at that young lady. Otherwise, he would betray Mr. Dong Hua sooner or later.

Wang Xuan leaned over and whispered into Qiao Nian’s ear. In a voice so low that only the two of them could hear, she asked carefully, “Why do I feel that Brother Cao doesn’t like you?”

Qiao Nian’s lips curved up slightly. She turned her head and saw Brother Cao fleeing in a panic. She raised her eyebrows and said nonchalantly, “It’s fine. Look, Mr. Dong Hua is very dissatisfied with him.”

Wang Xuan turned to look.

Pfft.

She tried to control the smile on her face.

That was really the case!

Mr. Dong Hua looked at Brother Cao with disdain.

At this moment, Xia Xue was already in a difficult position. She had already found other excuses, and was hesitating about how to avoid the performance.

Gao Lin, who had been standing beside Xia Xue, hurriedly stepped forward. She looked at Xia Xue expectantly and said, “Sister Xia Xue, I believe you. You have to believe in yourself. You’re much more outstanding than Qiao Nian. You can show her your skills and make her admit defeat!”

Before Xia Xue could refuse, she choked on Gao Lin’s words. She turned back to look at Gao Lin and frowned.

However, Gao Lin thought that Xia Xue was praising her. She hurriedly made a gesture of encouragement.

Xia Xue wanted to blame Gao Lin, but she suddenly realized that Gao Lin had no idea that she was an imposter.

At this moment, the situation was already very critical. She had no choice but to compete.

Xia Xue lowered her gaze. Just as she was thinking about what to compete in, she heard Gao Lin say loudly, “Sister Xia Xue, let’s compete in violin playing!”

Xia Xue almost vomited blood. Her anger was already at the top of her head, but she couldn’t flare up.

When the other students heard Gao Lin’s words, they hurriedly took out tissues to wipe their tears.

“Senior Xia, we’ll cheer for you!”

“Senior Xia, don’t worry. We’ve already prepared tissues!”

“Senior Xia, let’s begin!”

…

Wang Xuan, who was standing at the side, revealed a bright smile and said, “Yes, Senior Xia Xue, you don’t have to worry about us. We’ve already prepared tissues. We all want to know how amazing you are. If Brother Cao takes a liking to you, we can all learn from you in the future!”

With that, Wang Xuan turned to look at Qiao Nian and asked with a smile, “Nian Nian, don’t you think so?”

Qiao Nian immediately gave a sweet smile. This smile won the favor of many male classmates.

“Yes, Senior Xia. Please teach us!”

Gao Lin looked at Qiao Nian and secretly rolled her eyes.

She had never seen a woman as arrogant as Qiao Nian. Was Qiao Nian tired of living? How dare she provoke Xia Xue?

Qiao Nian probably didn’t know what death was since she dared to compete with the female musician Mr. Dong Hua had taken a liking to.

Actually, Xia Xue had initially wanted to use the piano she was best at, but she was now in a difficult position.

Helpless, Xia Xue walked towards the violin. Her hands were cold and covered in sweat. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Seeing how calm Xia Xue was, Gao Lin glanced at the students present and pretended to think. “What should you play?”

Xia Xue knew that something was wrong. Worried that Gao Lin would say something wrong again, she hurriedly said, “Why don’t we…”

“Missing, right?” Gao Lin said loudly, thinking that she understood Xia Xue’s intentions.

Xia Xue was shocked.

Xia Xue’s eyes widened and she almost fainted!

Gao Lin was such a useless teammate!
