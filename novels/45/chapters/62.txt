Wang An’s gaze turned cold, and his expression grew more and more serious. His brow furrowed into a frown. His gaze fell on Shen Xing’s face, and then on Qiao Nian.

Qiao Xin, who was standing not far away, heaved a sigh of relief. This was great. She no longer needed to tell on Qiao Nian. She would no longer be implicated in this mess.

What made Qiao Xin the happiest was that Qiao Nian would definitely be expelled by the principal. Qiao Nian would never be able to study in this school ever again.

However, she still had to put on a facade. Qiao Xin pretended to look worriedly at Qiao Nian.

Shen Xing could also sense Wang An’s dissatisfaction. Her lips curved up involuntarily. She glanced at Qiao Nian with a smug expression. She could already picture Qiao Nian leaving the campus dejectedly.

“Principal, we’ve already thought about it. We’ll just chase Qiao Nian out…”

“You…” Wang An cut in. He said expressionlessly, “I’ve heard everything you said. ”

“Principal, please speak!” Shen Xing looked at Wang An expectantly, her lips curving up slightly.

“Alright.” Wang An looked at Shen Xing with disappointment written all over his face. In the end, he said, “Shen Xing, after tomorrow, pack your things and leave this place. From now on, you are not to set foot in An University ever again!”

The smile on Shen Xing’s face gradually disappeared. She looked at Wang An in disbelief. Her lips trembled slightly. “Wh-what?”

Everyone present was stunned.

The precious daughter of the Shen family.

The Shen family and An University were deeply affiliated.

No one had expected that the principal would choose to disregard Matriarch Shen’s dignity and status.

Qiao Xin was also stunned. Standing in the middle of the chaos, she looked at the principal in disbelief. She had never expected the principal to expel Shen Xing!

Seeing that the principal had nothing more to say, Shen Xing said shakily, “Um, Principal, d-did I say anything wrong?”

Shen Xing’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face, and she instantly overcame her fear to speak. “Qiao Nian has taken your seat. I’m speaking up for you. Why are you expelling me?”

Wang An looked at Shen Xing with a somber expression. Only then did he say, “That seat was hers to begin with.”

The moment his words fell, everyone who was watching the spectacle was stunned.

Qiao Nian was sitting in the middle of the first row.

Qiao Nian’s seat was even better than that of the principal!

Shen Xing looked at the principal in shock, then at Qiao Nian. “Qiao Nian? How is that possible? She’s just a student who dropped out in the middle of her studies!”

“Qiao Nian is our principal!”

Wang An said expressionlessly.

In an instant, everyone seemed to have been struck by lightning.

Shen Xing’s teeth chattered, and her mind went blank.

How was this possible?

This couldn’t be happening!

Qiao Nian couldn’t be the principal!

Shen Xing looked at Qiao Nian in a daze.

Qiao Xin’s heart was racing. Her voice trembled as she spoke. “Principal, m-my sister just came out of the mental hospital. She…”

When everyone heard Qiao Xin’s words, they looked at Wang An intently. They wanted to know what was going on.

Wang An stood there with a gentlemanly air. He said to everyone, “Three quarters of the trophies in the collection room on the seventh floor were won by Qiao Nian.”

“How can a lunatic be so outstanding?” Shen Xing blurted out!

Everyone gradually turned to look at Shen Xing, frowning. They all felt that Shen Xing should not have said this.

As for the man of the hour, Qiao Nian, she sat there calmly, as if everything happening had nothing to do with her.

“Shen Xing, you can leave now.” Wang An looked toward Shen Xing expressionlessly.

Shen Xing glanced at Wang An before retracting her gaze. Her gaze landed on Qiao Nian’s face not far away. “Qiao Nian, it was Qiao Nian who burned down the school building. You…”

“Qiao Nian wasn’t the one who burned down the school building!” Wang An said coldly, his hands behind his back.
