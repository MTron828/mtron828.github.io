Chapter 608: Lying to Me Again?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Helplessness flashed in the man’s eyes. He squatted down and reached out to help Qiao Nian take off her shoes.

“Don’t.” Qiao Nian wanted to retract her foot.

The man didn’t speak. He just held Qiao Nian’s foot stubbornly.

“Let go.” Qiao Nian looked anxious.

“I didn’t let go last time, and I won’t do it again.” The man knelt on one knee in front of Qiao Nian and looked up at her. His eyes were gentle, and his voice was hoarse, as if he was tugging at Qiao Nian’s heartstrings.

Qiao Nian looked at him in surprise.

What did he mean by not letting go the last time?

Qiao Nian looked at the man in front of her in confusion. She seemed to have thought of something and said softly, “I…”

“Or are you lying to me again?”

Qiao Nian immediately gasped. When he was talking to her just now, he had already taken off her shoe, revealing her fair and flawless foot. His hand was holding her foot tightly.

This…

If a person with a sprained ankle was touched, they would definitely cry out in pain.

She had been so wary of the man in front of her that she had completely forgotten about this.

She pursed her lips. She had a bad feeling about this. Seeing the man’s face gradually enlarge, she said, “You went to see Lu Zhu, huh?”

Qiao Nian moved back silently. The man’s voice was too dangerous. His last word was mixed with his displeasure.

The atmosphere in the room gradually darkened. Qiao Nian pursed her lips and looked at the man in front of her uneasily.

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned.

How did Gu Chuan know that she had gone to look for Lu Zhu?

Huh?

Right, Gu Chuan seemed to know Gu Zhou. Did Gu Zhou also know that she had gone to look for Lu Zhu?

This…

Was Gu Zhou spying on her?

Previously, he had asked Chen Qing to send her off not because he cared about her, but because he wanted to monitor her.

Could it be that Gu Zhou was so angry that he wanted to question her, but wanted to control himself? Was that why his personality had changed? Was that why Gu Chuan had come out?

Qiao Nian pursed her lips slightly and looked at the man in front of her. The man’s eyes were filled with anger, but he restrained himself, as if he didn’t want to hurt her.

She was prepared to tolerate Gu Chuan’s anger. Before she could speak, she was pressed onto the bed by the man.

The man looked down at her from above. Their bodies were pressed against each other, and Qiao Nian was almost unable to breathe.

She remembered very clearly that before she married Qiao Xin, she didn’t know Gu Zhou at all. Moreover, she had never seen Gu Zhou before. The two of them had never interacted at all.

Moreover, it was impossible for them to have met.

Her memory was very good. She would never forget a man with such a strong aura like Gu Zhou.

In other words, they were originally two parallel lines. It was impossible for them to intersect.

She was very sure that the day she married Gu Zhou was the first time she had met him. During that meeting, she had also discovered that Gu Zhou was wary of her.

“Tell me!”

Smelling the scent on his body, Qiao Nian met Gu Zhou’s compelling eyes. Panting heavily, she said, “It hurts, Gu Chuan. You’re pressing down so hard that I can’t breathe.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Perhaps Gu Chuan had mistaken her for someone else, but she was very sure that Gu Chuan would never hurt her.

Gu Chuan raised his body slightly. Qiao Nian felt fresh air rush into her chest, and she felt much better.

“Is this considered close?” The displeasure in Gu Chuan’s eyes was obvious. He seemed to dislike Qiao Nian leaving him. “Didn’t I tell you in the past not to leave me?”

Qiao Nian knew that Gu Chuan was very possessive, so she explained, “I asked him for help.”

The man stared unblinkingly into Qiao Nian’s eyes, as if he wanted to confirm the truth of her words.

Qiao Nian looked at the man in surprise. She didn’t understand why he was jealous.

The man could see the confusion in Qiao Nian’s eyes. He lowered his gaze slightly, but his voice was very domineering. “Nian’er, do you really not remember?”

“I remember. You’re Gu Chuan.”

Qiao Nian said in confusion. She didn’t understand what the man was trying to say. Why couldn’t he just say it?

She was really curious.

But she didn’t dare to ask.

She was really afraid that if she said anything wrong, Gu Chuan would touch her again.

“Have you really forgotten about me? I told you that if you did, I would punish you.”
