813 Mommy Is Here

“Of course it’s true!”

Xiao Shi’s face was filled with excitement, and her eyes were filled with stars. She turned to look at Gu Qi, who was sitting at the side, and said happily, “Brother, did you hear that? Mommy will be here soon, and you’ll be able to see her. Mommy has been thinking about you at home. She’ll definitely be very happy to see you!”

Gu Qi was not as excited as he had been when he was young. In the past, he had wanted to see his mommy the most and could not wait to be with her. However, after thinking for a long time, he hesitated.

He didn’t know how to get along with his mommy.

Moreover, he was a little worried that his mommy would not be able to accept Auntie Nian Nian.

After thinking about it, Gu Qi finally thought of a compromise.

“Xiao Shi.” Gu Qi looked at Xiao Shi seriously and said, “Can I pretend to be you first and spend some time with Mommy? After we get along, I’ll take the initiative to tell her my identity?”

When she heard Gu Qi’s words, she recalled how excited she had been when she saw her father last night.

Brother must be too excited to tell Mommy his identity directly.

After Brother got familiar with Mommy, he would get along happily with her.

“Okay!” Xiao Shi nodded.

Gu Qi heaved a sigh of relief. He looked at Lin Tao, who was standing not far away, and asked, “Auntie Lin Tao, can I trouble you with something?”

Lin Tao looked at Gu Qi in confusion. “What is it?”

“Can I trouble you to leave the house with my sister first? That way, I can be alone with Mommy!” Gu Qi looked at Lin Tao seriously.

Lin Tao was stunned. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Were all children nowadays like this?

If she hadn’t seen it with her own eyes, she wouldn’t have believed that these two children could say such things.

Lin Tao hesitated for a moment before asking, “Can you really do it alone?”

Gu Qi pursed his lips. After a long while, he nodded and said, “Auntie Lin Tao, don’t worry. I can do it alone. I want to slowly get familiar with her through this method.”

Seeing Gu Qi’s words, Lin Tao couldn’t persuade him anymore, so she agreed.

Lin Tao left with Xiao Shi first.

Gu Qi was the only one left in the Dongjiang villa.

Gu Qi sat on the small sofa with a serious expression. He placed his small hands on his knees and clenched his fists tightly, looking nervous.

Qiao Nian’s face appeared in his mind. His biological mother was about to arrive, but he was so unfilial. Yet, he wanted Auntie Nian Nian to be his mother.

Just as Gu Qi’s thoughts were running wild, the doorbell rang.

Gu Qi’s heart beat faster and faster. His body tensed up involuntarily. He sat there, not knowing what to do.

After a while, the doorbell rang again.

Gu Qi pursed his lips tightly. He mustered his courage and walked towards the entrance of the villa.

When he reached the door of the villa, he opened it.

There was a very beautiful woman standing outside the door.

Gu Qi’s mind raced.

So his biological mother was also so good-looking.

Gu Qi wanted to call her Mommy, but he couldn’t bring himself to do so.

Song Man stood there calmly. She looked at the gorgeous princess dress Xiao Shi was wearing, and a trace of surprise flashed in her eyes.

When Xiao Shi wore this dress, she did not look poor at all. Instead, she looked like a young lady who had grown up in a rich family. She looked like the daughter of a rich family.

The only difference between Xiao Shi and before was that in the past, Xiao Shi could not wait to get close to her, but now, Xiao Shi stood there motionless.

Qin Chuan stood beside Song Man with a gentle smile on his face. He asked, “Xiao Shi, can I enter your house now?”

Gu Qi stood at the side and made way.

Seeing Xiao Shi like this, Song Man frowned.

Why wasn’t Xiao Shi close to her now?

Could it be that she was unwilling to bother with her because she had been separated from her for two days?

Song Man did not want to be distant from Xiao Shi. She would have to rely on her to do many things in the future.

Moreover, if she wanted to be with Gu Zhou, she had to rely on Xiao Shi.
