Chapter 1726 - 1726 Reunion (2)

He had slicked-back silver hair. Every wrinkle on his face seemed to document his past glory.

There was a gentle smile in his eyes and his lips curved up, making him look like a compassionate man.

Qiao Nian’s eyes turned red uncontrollably. She couldn’t believe her eyes. In a daze, she walked towards the old man, who was emitting a Buddhist light that could save all living beings.

She seemed to be dreaming, but also she didn’t seem to be dreaming.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Even if she was dreaming, she hoped that this dream would last longer. She wanted to take a few more glances at him.

Chang Feng rarely saw Qiao Nian so stunned. In a daze, he seemed to have returned to his childhood.

At that time, they had studied medicine with their master. Every time their master showed off his powerful medical skills, Nian Nian would always look like this. She looked shocked, as if she had lost her soul.

Chang Feng couldn’t help but laugh out loud. Then, he turned his head uncomfortably to the side and rubbed his nose.

Grandpa Qin sensed Chang Feng’s cheap shot. His expression instantly darkened. He glared daggers at him and said coldly, “Have you forgotten everything I taught you previously?”

Chang Feng suppressed his laughter and tried hard to remain calm, as if he was maintaining a military stance. He said seriously, “Nian Nian is the best. I can never tease her.”

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Chang Feng’s face not far away. In a daze, she seemed to have returned to her childhood. At that time, he would have this expression every time Eldest Senior Brother laughed at her.

Memories of the past surged back like a tide. She still remembered the scene of the three of them fooling around. She had even secretly gone up the mountain with Eldest Senior Brother to pick herbs. Every time they made a mistake, Eldest Senior Brother would protect her.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Grandpa Qin’s face again. If it weren’t for Grandpa Qin back then, she might not have survived.

She took a step forward. When her foot landed firmly on the ground, she realized that this wasn’t a dream. It was all real.

Her master was fine, and he was still alive.

Qiao Nian’s eyes instantly turned red. She quickly stepped forward and hugged Grandpa Qin, burying her head in his arms. In a sobbing voice, she said, “Grandpa, where have you been these past few years? Old Qin and I have been looking for you. We’ve been looking for you for a long time, but we haven’t heard from you. We’re really worried about you!”

Tears streamed down her face uncontrollably. To Qiao Nian, Grandpa Qin was the warm sunlight of her dark childhood. It was Grandpa Qin who had given her something to stand on, allowing her to live better in this world and become more outstanding.

“Nian Nian.” Grandpa Qin gently patted Qiao Nian’s back. You have grown up. “Back then, the situation was urgent. We accidentally got involved in Cui Huai’s scheme. After that, I followed Chang Feng to MY. What they were going to do was very dangerous, so I didn’t contact you.”

Grandpa Qin looked down at Qiao Nian in his arms, his eyes filled with affection. All these years, his Nian Nian had been very strong and smart to handle everything by herself.

“Nian Nian, in the past few years when I wasn’t around, have your medical skills improved?” Grandpa Qin paused and asked in a low voice.

Although Qiao Nian was already a little taller than Grandpa Qin, she was now slightly hunched over. Her grandfather’s embrace was as warm as ever, and she couldn’t bear to let go of him.

Her grandfather still smelled of Chinese medicine. She had smelled his scent since she was young. She liked this smell very much.

“I’ve been studying medicine well. Moreover, the world-renowned Dr. Ollie has said that my medical skills are good. Grandpa, don’t worry. I’ll definitely bring our medical skills to greater heights!” When Qiao Nian said this, she was like a child seeking praise, her eyes smiling.

“Where’s Xiao Chuan? He’s been mischievous since he was young. I wonder if he’s taking good care of you now.” Grandpa Qin knew his biological grandson very well. The two of them often played around when they were young.

“Qin Chuan has already grown up. He knows how to take care of me now and is very obedient,” Qiao Nian said with a smile.
