1356 Worry

Gu Zhou’s illness was something he was born with. He had it for more than twenty years, and it was very difficult to treat it completely.

If she could find her grandfather, perhaps he would have a way to treat Gu Zhou’s illness. She would no longer have to worry about Gu Zhou’s illness then.

Qiao Nian sat in front of the experiment table and recalled that Eldest Senior Brother had limped away. Chen Qing had even said that Eldest Senior Brother’s abdomen was injured.

If only she could contact Eldest Senior Brother. That way, she would know about his condition and not worry every day.

She wanted to use her hacking skills to contact Eldest Senior Brother, but he did not reply.

Whenever Qiao Nian thought of that dream, she felt uneasy.

After a while, she stood up and began to make pills for Matriarch Gu and Gu Zhou. When she was done, she took the pills she had made for Matriarch Gu to Matriarch Gu’s room.

Qiao Nian stood at the door and knocked. Matriarch Gu’s voice came from inside.

“Come in.”

Qiao Nian pushed the door open and walked in. Seeing Matriarch Gu flipping through a fashion magazine, she smiled and said, “Grandma, you should rest more. You can’t tire yourself out.”

When Matriarch Gu heard Qiao Nian’s words, she naturally placed the book on the table at the side and said, “It’s just reading. I won’t be tired. Nian Nian, come and sit down. I’ll show you the classic wedding dresses from the past years. See which style you like.”

Qiao Nian walked to the chair beside Matriarch Gu and sat down. She pushed the bottle filled with pills in front of Matriarch Gu and said with a smile, “Grandma, these are the pills I’ve prepared for you. You’ll feel better after eating more of these.”

When Matriarch Gu heard Qiao Nian’s words, she looked at the medicine bottle on the table and reached out to hold Qiao Nian’s hand.

“Nian Nian.”

“Yes?”

“You don’t have to worry about me all the time. You should think about yourself more,” Matriarch Gu said earnestly. Smiling at Qiao Nian, she said, “When you married into the Gu family, we didn’t prepare a wedding for you either. Grandma already felt bad. Now that the children have been found, shouldn’t you think about your wedding?”

When Qiao Nian heard Matriarch Gu’s words, she smiled and said, “Grandma, there’s no hurry about my wedding. As long as our family is fine, I’ll be satisfied.”

Qiao Nian was long past the age of fantasizing about her wedding. Although Gu Zhou had suggested a wedding, she was already very satisfied.

It wasn’t that she didn’t believe Gu Zhou, but there were too many things they had to face now. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

If Song Yu hadn’t reminded her, she wouldn’t have expected someone to dare to attack in the country.

According to Song Yu, someone in the Lu family seemed to be traitorous.

Qiao Nian’s eyes gradually darkened. If someone from the Lu family was really an accomplice, wouldn’t her children be forced to be separated from their flesh and blood like her?

“When you have time, go on a trip with Gu Zhou. The two of you haven’t even had a good time relaxing together.” When Matriarch Gu thought of how Qiao Nian had worried so much about this family, her heart ached.

After Qiao Nian left the medicine for Matriarch Gu, she stood up and walked out. She played with the three children for a while. At this moment, the servant returned and handed the latiao she had bought to Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian distributed the latiao to the three children. A child could only eat three pieces of latiao, which was just enough to finish a packet of latiao.

Xiao Shi ate the latiao, which were so spicy that her lips turned red. Tears welled up in her eyes, but she said excitedly, “Mommy, this is the best latiao I’ve ever eaten.”

Qiao Nian reached out and patted Xiao Shi’s head. Smiling, she said, “You’re still young. You can’t eat too much. Latiao is junk food. Even if you grow up, you can’t eat too much.”

The three children agreed obediently.

After dinner, Matriarch Gu watched television with the three children for a while before returning to her room to rest. She asked Qiao Nian to watch television with the children.

After Matriarch Gu returned to her room, she called Gu Zhou.

The call went through very quickly.

“Grandmother.”

“Ah Zhou, I have something to ask you,” Matriarch Gu said solemnly.

“What is it?”

“When do you plan to hold your wedding with Nian Nian?”
