1235 Where’s the Performer?

Qiao Nian glanced at the man indifferently and casually walked to the sofa to sit down. She raised her eyebrows slightly at the man. “The stage has been set up. Where’s the performer?”

The man was a little stunned. He looked at Qiao Nian in surprise. Logically speaking, Qiao Nian should be afraid. Why wasn’t she afraid at all?

“This isn’t Ghost City,” the man said dryly, as if reminding Qiao Nian that this wasn’t the place they had agreed to go to.

“I know.”

“You’ve been kidnapped!” The man felt that if Qiao Nian heard these words, she would definitely be frightened out of her wits.

“Then why aren’t you calling your master out?” Qiao Nian’s face was filled with disdain.

This time, the man was even more dumbfounded.

Qiao Nian actually knew that she had been kidnapped. Wasn’t she afraid that he would ask his master to call her out?

Were all the kidnapped people so calm now?

Or could it be that this woman had been playing with him from head to toe! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Realizing this, the man’s expression instantly darkened. He looked at Qiao Nian ferociously and shouted angrily, “Qiao Nian, let me tell you, you’ve been kidnapped now. It’s better if you behave yourself. You’re so arrogant. Don’t kneel down and beg for mercy later!”

Qiao Nian was getting impatient. Frowning, she said, “Where did this mad dog come from? Why is he barking non-stop? I wonder what hisMaster taught him!”

“How… how dare you say that I’m a mad dog!”

Qiao Nian’s words were like stepping on this man’s dog tail. The man instantly exploded. In a rage, he walked up to Qiao Nian and raised his hand to slap her.

However, just as the man’s hand was raised in midair, a gentle and pleasant female voice came from not far away.

“Stop!”

The man stopped what he was doing and stood aside reluctantly.

At this moment, a woman in a white fur coat walked out with noble and elegant footsteps.

Qiao Nian’s lips curved up coldly. She didn’t even need to look to know who it was.

She did not make any enemies in MY, and the only person she did not get along with was Jiang Yue.

Jiang Yue’s hair was gently pinned behind her head with a hairpin. She stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian, but there was a hint of reprimand in her tone. She said to the man beside her, “Miss Qiao is our guest now. We have to be gentler to her.”

Her tone was like a high and mighty goddess reprimanding her pet.

When the man heard Jiang Yue’s words, he immediately lowered his head and apologized. “Yes, Miss Jiang. I was in the wrong.”

Jiang Yue raised her head high and looked at Qiao Nian with a disdainful smile, looking extremely superior. “Second Sister-in-law, I really didn’t expect to meet under such circumstances.”

Qiao Nian looked up at Jiang Yue and smiled. “What do you mean by this?”

When Jiang Yue heard Qiao Nian’s words, she walked to the armchair on the other side and sat down. There was a faint smile on her face. “Second Sister-in-law, if you want to be a guest at your place, you should send an invitation in advance. It will take a lot of time to go back and forth, so I had no choice but to invite you over.”

When Qiao Nian heard Jiang Yue’s words, she had a faint smile on her face. She continued, “You invited me over in Jiang Chi’s name. I wonder if Jiang Chi knows?”

“Extreme times require extreme measures. Second Sister-in-law should know this better than me.” Jiang Yue crossed her legs and smiled at Qiao Nian, the smugness in her eyes obvious. “I learned it from Second Sister-in-law. After all, Second Sister-in-law is quite charming. Not only did she charm Brother Ah Zhou, but she also charmed the Lu brothers.”

Qiao Nian raised her eyebrows slightly and asked, “After saying so much, why did you invite me over?”

“Since Second Sister-in-law isn’t willing to catch up, let’s get straight to the point!” Jiang Yue smiled and clapped. At this moment, a nanny walked in.

The nanny was also holding a tray with a very beautiful glass bottle. There seemed to be some liquid in the bottle.

The nanny placed the glass bottle on the coffee table and left.
