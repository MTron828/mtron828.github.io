884 Send Him to the Emergency Room!

“Doctor! Nurse!”

When the doctors and nurses passing by not far away heard Qiao Nian’s cry, they quickly rushed over and helped Qiao Nian help Gu Zhou to a portable bed.

Qiao Nian looked down at Gu Zhou’s pale face. His lips were pale, as if they would shatter with a touch.

Her gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s forehead. Seeing that his head was covered in sweat, she was slightly stunned.

When she was talking to Gu Zhou just now, she had been paying attention to his gaze and not his expression.

It seemed that Gu Zhou had been holding back for a long time.

However, Qiao Nian didn’t understand why Gu Zhou had to endure the discomfort. Why didn’t he say that he was uncomfortable when he was hugging her?

Could it be that he had been feeling unwell since he came up?

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian’s heart gradually sank. Pain gradually spread throughout her body.

The doctor briefly examined Gu Zhou’s condition and said to the nurse with a serious expression, “The patient’s condition isn’t good now. He has to be sent to the emergency room!”

“There’s no need.” Qiao Nian refused and looked at the doctor seriously. “Send him to a private ward now.”

Previously, she had prepared a medicinal bath and acupuncture for Gu Zhou. Gu Zhou had not had an attack in a long time.

Qiao Nian knew that Gu Zhou had fallen ill because of what had happened when he was young. At that time, Gu Zhou had been too nervous and uneasy, which was why he had fallen ill.

Qiao Nian took out a medicine bottle from Gu Zhou’s suit jacket, took out a pill, and stuffed it into Gu Zhou’s mouth.

The doctor was stunned when he heard this. He frowned and said, “The patient’s condition is very critical. It’s best to send him to the emergency room now. Otherwise, even a god won’t be able to save him. What are you putting in his mouth? If you don’t understand, can you stop causing trouble? You…”

Qiao Nian glared daggers at him.

The doctor’s scalp went numb under Qiao Nian’s gaze. He immediately fell silent and pursed his lips.

Qiao Nian retracted her gaze and lowered her head to hold Gu Zhou’s hand. With a serious expression, she said, “Don’t worry, I won’t let anything happen to you.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The doctor standing at the side was already speechless.

He was clearly the doctor. Where did this woman get her confidence from?

Just as the doctor was about to speak, he saw the woman say to the nurse beside her, “Find a private ward.”

The two nurses looked at each other. In the end, they both looked at the doctor.

The doctor coughed and finally nodded. He wanted to see what this woman was going to do.

In the end, Gu Zhou was pushed into a private ward.

The doctor stood at the side with a frown. Seeing the woman take out some silver needles, his expression turned serious.

He saw that woman insert a silver needle into the patient’s body.

Before he could react, she was about to insert all the other silver needles into the patient’s head.

He was a Western doctor, but he also knew a little about Chinese medicine.

He knew that the places the woman inserted should be all acupuncture points.

Qiao Nian was fully focused on performing acupuncture on Gu Zhou. Seeing Gu Zhou frown on the bed, her heart, which had been in her throat, finally relaxed.

The nurse watched Qiao Nian’s actions and saw the patient frown. She asked worriedly, “Is he in pain? I’ll send him to the emergency room!”

“Only I can treat his illness!” Qiao Nian didn’t even look at the nurse. She stared unblinkingly at Gu Zhou, taking his pulse. Her expression grew more and more serious.

When the doctor heard Qiao Nian’s words, he said unhappily, “If you trust a doctor, there must be a way to help you save him!”

After taking Gu Zhou’s pulse, Qiao Nian placed his hand on the bed. She looked up at the doctor and asked, “If he goes to the emergency room, where do you plan to start?”

The doctor glanced at Gu Zhou, who was lying on the bed, and said, “Of course we have to do a checkup first. We have to confirm what’s wrong with him before we can treat the illness.”

Qiao Nian smiled and nodded. “I agree with you, but I’m his private doctor. I know everything about him.”

Doctor was speechless. If he already has a private doctor, why did you still come to the hospital?

Just as the doctor finished thinking, he saw that the person on the bed had already woken up.

He was stunned.

This woman had pricked the patient with just a few needles. How could she be so powerful?
