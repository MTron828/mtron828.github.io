Chapter 1742 - 1742 Injured

If his father had known what he had just said, he might cut ties with him!

Wright looked at the president in front of him. He couldn’t understand why the president, who had been like a little white rabbit, had suddenly become so fierce.

There was still anger in the President’s eyes as he said, “Lock him up in the water prison. Don’t let him eat or drink. Let him enjoy himself in the water prison!”

When Wright heard the words “water prison”, his expression changed drastically. That was a torture place. Basically, everyone who had been in the water prison would have health problems.

Wright looked down at himself. He had just suffered many injuries. If he stayed in the water prison, his injuries would probably fester. Wouldn’t that kill him?

After Wright was taken away, Qiao Nian glanced at Lin Mian’s men and gave them a look. Those people let go of Wright and left, as if they had never appeared.

The president naturally noticed Qiao Nian’s gaze. Seeing them leave, he understood that those people should be following Qiao Nian’s orders.

Gu Zhou walked up to the president and explained, “President, I’m really sorry that we have people here.”

“It’s fine. If anyone asks, just say that they’re my men,” the president said generously. It seemed that the Gu family’s strength had not diminished.

The president was willing to cover up for those people because Chen Qing was protecting Lina. He saw many bullets not far from the wall. They were probably bullets left behind by Wright who had specially fired at Chen Qing.

If it weren’t for Chen Qing, his daughter would probably have been killed. Speaking of which, he should thank Chen Qing.

If Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian hadn’t rushed over earlier, Chen Qing might have been gone too. In the end, it was all for his Lina. How could he kick someone to the curb when they’ve outlived their usefulness?

The President’s gaze fell on Lina’s hands. Only then did he notice that Lina’s hand was wrapped in gauze. His expression changed drastically and he quickly walked over. “Are you injured? That beast, Wright, actually injured you!”

At this moment, the president’s desire to kill Wright grew stronger. He wanted to bring Mark down, but he couldn’t let his daughter suffer any more humiliation. “Come back with me. Don’t worry about the rest.”

Chen Qing wanted to walk over to Lina, but his legs were a little weak. Qiao Nian walked over to support Chen Qing. When she saw Gu Zhou approaching, she threw Chen Qing to him. “Hold him.”

Before Chen Qing could react, he leaned against Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou hadn’t understood what Qiao Nian meant by “holding him” just now. When there was a weight beside him, he subconsciously glanced at the person beside him.

Chen Qing noticed Gu Zhou’s gaze and stood up straight reflexively. “I can walk!”

He had been focused on dodging the bullets just now. His nerves and his muscles were tense. He just couldn’t recover for a moment.

When Gu Zhou heard Chen Qing’s words, he said coldly, “You can walk? Then why did you let Nian Nian support you?”

Chen Qing was speechless.

Qiao Nian quickly walked up to the president and said in a low voice, “President, Lina can’t go back now.”

When the President and Lina heard Qiao Nian’s words, they were both stunned. They looked at Qiao Nian in surprise.

Lina looked puzzled. Logically speaking, Nian Nian should be very worried about her safety. She should want her to go home early.

Qiao Nian said seriously, “This isn’t a good place to talk. President, why don’t we go to your villa?”Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Although there were no cameras here, this was Mark’s manor after all. It was always a little strange for them to discuss dealing with Mark here.

Seeing Gu Zhou walk over and agree with Qiao Nian, the President brought his men back to the villa.

As soon as they arrived at the president’s villa, Chen Qing hurriedly walked over to Qiao Nian and said in a low voice, “Young Madam, the Seventh Princess’s hand was injured by a knife. She only had a simple bandage. I don’t know if she needs stitches. Help take a look!”

Qiao Nian looked at Chen Qing’s face and teased, “You’re so concerned about her!”

Chen Qing’s face turned red uncontrollably. He pursed his lips and said nothing.
