1358 How Could It Be Him?

Gu Zhou was so adorable when he was young. Could it be that Bai Hui‚Äôs troubles came later? Otherwise, why would she be so heartless to Gu Zhou?

Or could it be that Bai Hui couldn‚Äôt stand Gu Zhou because of Gu Ting?

Even if Gu Zhou looked very similar to President Gu, Bai Hui could not be strict with Gu Zhou because of Gu Ting. ùëÖ√™·∫°d new chaptùíÜrs on no/v/e/lùíÉin(.)com

After all, Gu Zhou at that time only existed because of Gu Yue.

Gu Zhou had always been the most innocent one.

Qiao Nian recalled that when she found out that Xiao Shi and Gu Qi were her children, she understood that Gu Zhou was the person who had hurt her that night.

At that time, she was really afraid of meeting Gu Zhou, and she could not accept that the person who had ruined her was Gu Zhou.

However, she couldn‚Äôt bear to lose her temper at Xiao Qi and Xiao Shi.

Even if she couldn‚Äôt be with Gu Zhou forever in the future, she wouldn‚Äôt lose her temper at the three children. After all, the three children were her treasures.

At the thought of Gu Zhou‚Äôs previous life, Qiao Nian felt even worse.

Qiao Nian‚Äôs gaze fell on Bai Hui and Gu Ting‚Äôs photos again. Perhaps Gu Zhou wanted his parents to be together and not live separately, so he placed their photo in the first photo sleeve on the first page.

She recalled the first time she had seen Bai Hui. Gu Zhou had argued with Bai Hui and even protected her.

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze slightly. She was very happy that Gu Zhou could protect her, but she hoped that Gu Zhou could live a happier life and get along peacefully with Bai Hui.

Qiao Nian flipped to the second page. The photo at the top seemed to be Grandma. At that time, Grandma was still very young. She was wearing a dark blue cheongsam and was carrying a child.

A bright smile appeared on Grandma‚Äôs face. She seemed to be enveloped in a soft light, and she was so beautiful that she seemed unreal.

The entire Gu family was very good-looking. In the past, she had heard from others that the two young masters of the Gu family were extremely beautiful, like noble young masters who had come out of a painting.

Qiao Nian saw that the words ‚ÄúGu Ting‚Äù were written beside the photo. It seemed that the baby in this photo was Gu Ting.

The photo below was of Grandma in a white cheongsam sitting with a young man in a suit. This person should be Old Master Gu, who had already passed away.

They were truly a match made in heaven.

Grandpa held Grandma‚Äôs hand. Although there was no smile on his face in the photo, his eyes were filled with smiles.

At the side, Grandma‚Äôs lips curved up slightly. One could still see the dimples beside her cheek.

Smiling, Qiao Nian continued reading. Most of the photos were of Grandma, Gu Ting, and Gu Zhou.

When she reached the last few pages, her pupils dilated uncontrollably.

Why was there a photo of her here?

Previously, those photos were all glamorous. When it came to her photos, the style instantly changed.

There were photos of her joking with Gu Qi in the garden. The photos were all blurry.

There were also photos of her sleeping soundly in bed.

There was also a photo of her eating with food stains at the corner of her mouth.

She looked out of place in the entire photo album.

At the bottom was a blurry photo. It was a photo of her holding a snake when she first arrived at the Gu residence. It was obvious that he had taken a screenshot from the surveillance cameras.

There was also a photo of her curled up on the sofa. She had just married into the Gu family and was sleeping on the sofa.

Gu Zhou had actually secretly taken a photo of her?

Qiao Nian narrowed her eyes slightly. Had Gu Zhou been planning this for a long time?

Should she be happy that Gu Zhou was deeply in love with her, or should she be afraid that Gu Zhou was a pervert?

These photos simply ruined her beautiful image!

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian reached out to take out the photos. She didn‚Äôt want her ugly appearance to remain in the photo album.

At that moment, the door opened.

Qiao Nian subconsciously hid the photo album under her pillow. After hiding it, she looked over and saw a man in a black suit standing at the door.

That person was wearing a black scarf and half of his face hidden under it.

When Qiao Nian saw the man‚Äôs eyes, a trace of surprise flashed in them. She slowly sat up.

How could it be him?
