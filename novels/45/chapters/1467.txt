1468 Awake

At this moment, Lina’s face was scrunched up, as if she was enduring immense pain.

Just as the president was about to question Qiao Nian, he saw Lina tilt her head and vomit another mouthful of blood.

“What exactly did you do to Lina?” The president couldn’t help but look at Qiao Nian angrily.

“Ahem…” Lina coughed twice and lay back down on the bed, exhausted. She slowly opened her eyes and saw that the president was already pointing a gun at Qiao Nian. She called out weakly, “Dad…”

When the president heard Lina’s voice, his pupils dilated uncontrollably, and his eyes lit up. He hurriedly looked down at Lina. Lina’s pillow and the blanket in front of her were already stained red with her blood.

Seeing Lina open her eyes, Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief.

Previously, she had drunk the antidote as soon as she was poisoned. The poison in her body was quickly discharged.

However, Lina had been poisoned for a long time. She needed to use acupuncture to stimulate Lina to vomit the poison in her body. Now that Lina had vomited all the poisonous blood in her body, Lina was really fine!

Lina looked at the president and slowly raised her hand.

The president hurriedly held Lina’s hand with both hands, afraid that Lina would drop the silver needles on the back of her hand. His eyes were sparkling with tears. He tried hard to remain calm, but his trembling voice still betrayed his excited heart. “How are you now? Are you feeling better?”

“Dad, I’m much better now.” Lina recalled that when she first opened her eyes, her father was pointing a gun at Qiao Nian. Worried that she would faint again, she hurriedly explained, “Dad, you’ve really misunderstood Nian Nian. Although I was already unconscious just now, I could hear everything you said.”

The president frowned slightly, not understanding what Lina meant.

“It was Wright who got someone to assassinate me. They even forced Nian Nian to hand me over. Nian Nian was doing all of this to save me,” Lina said weakly.

The President’s expression instantly darkened, and his eyes were filled with a cold light.

The internal conflict in the royal family was endless. Everyone was thinking for themselves. Lina was injured this time because those people probably wanted to use Lina to force him into a corner.

This time, he had harmed Lina.

Previously, Lina said that she wanted Qiao Nian to treat his wife’s illness. At that time, he suspected that Qiao Nian had ulterior motives and doubted her medical skills. Now, he understood how wrong he was.

In the past ten hours, he suspected that Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian wanted to kidnap his Lina. At that time, he had already thought it through. After saving Lina, he would kill all the mercenaries. He would never allow those mercenaries to show off in his territory. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

However, in order to save his daughter, Gu Zhou had risked the world’s condemnation and death.

The president carefully placed Lina’s hand on the bed. He stood up straight and looked at Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian gently. With a sincere expression, he said, “Thank you for saving Lina. I was too nervous about her previously. If I’ve offended you in any way, I apologize.”

A breeze blew past, and Qiao Nian’s long hair swayed in the wind. With a friendly smile on her face, she said openly, “Mr. President, we’ve offended you greatly just now. This period of time has been too pressing. There are some things we can’t explain clearly, so our methods were a little extreme just now. It’s only right for you to do so.”

Although Qiao Nian looked about the same age as his Lina, she was calm and steady. Her medical skills were brilliant, and she was an outstanding child.

The president smiled slightly. His gaze fell on Lina’s face again and he asked gently, “How do you feel now?”

Lina only knew that before Qiao Nian gave her the medicine and acupuncture, all the bones in her body felt as if they had been gnawed on by ants. The pain was simply too torturous.

She had just vomited blood. The fatigue in her body was swept away, and the pain in her body instantly disappeared.
