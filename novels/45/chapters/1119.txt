1120 My condolences for your loss

Jiang Chi nodded and looked at Lu Qi with a trace of ruthlessness!

If Jiang Cheng was still alive, he and an innocent girl like Lu Qi would be a good match!

She had to pay the debt she owed!

Lu Zhu had caused Jiang Cheng’s death. Now, Lu Zhu’s sister, Lu Qi, was going to marry Jiang Cheng!

!!

Jiang Chi gave a cold smile. He wondered how Lu Zhu would react when he found out.

“Mr. Jiang, how can Mr. Jiang die!” Lu Qi looked at Jiang Chi in disbelief. He didn’t look old. If Mr. Jiang was Jiang Chi’s younger brother, he would definitely be younger!

“Blessings come with disaster. At that time, he trusted someone he shouldn’t have trusted. In the end, he was killed by that person! Unfortunately, I couldn’t avenge my brother.” When Jiang Chi said this, he looked a little disappointed!

“Brother Jiang, my condolences!” Lu Qi’s heart was in a mess. Her idol had actually passed away. It seemed that she was not fated with her idol.

“Now, I just want to fulfill my brother’s last wish.” Jiang Chi looked at Lu Qi’s pale face and said lightly, “My brother’s greatest wish when he was alive was to solve these ten questions. He once said that if the person who could solve these four questions was a boy, he would become sworn brothers with that person. If the person who solved this question was a girl, he would marry that girl.”

Lu Qi was still immersed in the pain of losing her idol, but when she heard Jiang Chi’s words, her beautiful eyes were filled with confusion.

She understood every word Mr. Jiang Chi said, but when they were combined, she didn’t understand.

What did he mean by taking that girl as his wife?

But Mr. Jiang was already dead. Then how would he marry that girl?

Jiang Chi stood up elegantly. His gaze landed on Lu Qi’s conflicted face and he said calmly, “The marriage between you and my brother is destined by the heavens. You don’t have to worry. I’ll hold a ghost marriage for the two of you.”

Lu Qi looked at Jiang Chi in fear. It was already the twenty-first century. How could this man still say something like a ghost marriage?

Could this man have come out of a mental hospital?

But he didn’t look like a lunatic.

Before Lu Qi could speak, Jiang Chi continued, “I’ll definitely hold a lively event at your wedding event location. I won’t mistreat you!”

Lu Qi looked at Jiang Chi speechlessly. She was now completely certain that this man was a little abnormal. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Mr. Jiang, forgive me for not agreeing to what you’re saying. I have other things to do today, so I’ll take my leave first!” As Lu Qi spoke, she turned around and walked out.

Lu Qi had just walked to the door when she was stopped by Jiang Chi’s two bodyguards.

Lu Qi glanced at the two bodyguards and frowned.

As Jiang Chi had lost his younger brother, Lu Qi did not want to rub salt in his wound. This was also the greatest respect she gave Mr. Jiang!

However, Jiang Chi’s actions angered Lu Qi. She had never seen Mr. Jiang before. She had come here today to discuss medical knowledge with Mr. Jiang, and she had no other feelings for him.

Since Mr. Jiang was no longer around, there was no need for her to chat with his brother, let alone hear him talk about those strange things.

Suppressing the anger in her heart, Lu Qi’s gaze landed on Jiang Chi’s face and she said seriously, “Brother Jiang, the dead can’t be revived. Please don’t stay in the past. Do you think you’re doing this for Mr. Jiang’s sake? What if he doesn’t like you doing this?”

Lu Qi paused for a moment and continued, “You said that you hate the people who caused Mr. Jiang to die. Then let me ask you, what’s the difference between your current actions and those people?”

Jiang Chi frowned and looked at Lu Qi in shock. There were not many people in this world who were not afraid of him. This young lady actually dared to lecture him in front of him. She was quite bold!

“Aren’t you afraid of me?” Jiang Chi raised his eyebrows slightly and asked coldly.
