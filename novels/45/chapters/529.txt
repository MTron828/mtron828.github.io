Chapter 530: Better All Disappear

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

If they disappeared…

Qiao Nian thought of Gu Zhou’s second personality, Zhou Zhou. His eyes were extremely clear. Every time he saw her, she seemed to be his entire world.

Zhou Zhou was insecure, innocent, and kind. He was a very cute little puppy.

Qiao Nian couldn’t bear to leave Zhou Zhou.

However, when she thought of Gu Zhou’s third personality, she could not help but shiver.

Forget it, they should all disappear!

It was really hard for her to imagine what kind of disaster would happen if Gu Zhou’s three personalities were all combined.

Anyway, it was too much for her.

She had never studied patients with schizophrenia before, nor had she treated patients with this disease. The only thing she could do now was to control Gu Zhou’s emotions.

If only her grandfather was still by her side. She believed that Gu Zhou would recover soon.

There was no point in dwelling on it now. Let nature take its course.

After taking a shower and changing her clothes, Qiao Nian came out of the bathroom.

Gu Zhou also walked out of another bathroom. He was wearing a dark blue shirt and black pants that accentuated his long legs.

Gu Zhou casually picked up the suit at the side and placed it on his shoulder indifferently. He leaned lazily on the sofa, emitting a cold aura that made people unable to approach him.

When Gu Zhou saw Qiao Nian come out of the bathroom, he stood up and said indifferently, “Alright, let’s go!”

“Yes.”

Gu Zhou walked in front. As soon as he opened the door, he saw Chen Qing leaning against the door outside, sleeping.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but admire Chen Qing’s professionalism.

The sound of the door opening woke Chen Qing up. He quickly woke up. “Second Young Master, Second Young Madam!”

“To the hospital!” Gu Zhou’s expression was cold.

“Yes!”

After going downstairs together, Gu Zhou sat in the car. He looked at the rainy day outside and felt a little empty.

From what he could remember, he didn’t like rainy days.

Every time it rained, he felt uneasy.

He felt as if something important had happened last night. This memory was important to him, but he couldn’t remember the past…

Irritation spread from the bottom of his heart. Gu Zhou casually crossed his legs and sat down coldly.

He leaned back in his chair and played with the jade ring on his finger.

Even so, he couldn’t ease the frustration in his heart. He placed his hand in his pocket and wanted to take out the cigarette box. When he thought of Qiao Nian sitting beside him, he couldn’t help but give up.

Sitting beside Gu Zhou, Qiao Nian could feel his frustration. She suddenly remembered something.

Gu Zhou seemed to be in a mood. She thought of Gu Chuan from last night. If she remembered correctly, Gu Chuan had appeared on a rainy day.

Qiao Nian knew that Gu Zhou needed to calm down. She said, “You can smoke in the car. I don’t mind.”

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell indifferently on Qiao Nian’s face. He said slowly, “I don’t want cigarette smoke to cover your scent.”

Qiao Nian was shocked.

Chen Qing, who was driving, almost couldn’t react in time and stepped on the accelerator.

Qiao Nian’s entire body moved forward uncontrollably. She was about to crash into the back of the passenger seat.

At this moment, Gu Zhou stretched out his long arm and pulled Qiao Nian into his arms.

Caught off guard, Qiao Nian sat down on Gu Zhou’s lap.

The man’s hands tightened around her waist. Her back pressed against his chest.

Qiao Nian could feel that the places she and Gu Zhou touched were burning hot. Her ears turned red uncontrollably. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

She quickly took a deep breath and pretended to be calm as she silently got off him.

Qiao Nian looked up and met his smiling eyes. They were 30% seductive and 70% meaningful.
