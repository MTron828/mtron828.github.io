Chapter 497: Hitting People

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian stood in front of Song Yue, her eyes cold. It was as if she had seen a disgusting cockroach.

Qiao Nian’s undisguised disdain drove Song Yue crazy. With a look of dissatisfaction, she rebuked. “How dare you look at me like that? Who do you think you are?”

Bam!

The crisp slap echoed through the corridor.

Qiao Nian’s slap landed hard on Song Yue’s face.

At this moment, Song Yue had been hit by Qiao Nian. She felt a burning sensation on her face, and the pain was unbearable.

Song Yue turned around abruptly and looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief. She said fiercely, “Qiao Nian, how dare you hit me? If it weren’t for you, I wouldn’t be in this state now. You clearly owe me.”

Bam!

Another resounding slap!

Xu Qian was stunned. She didn’t dare to step forward to pull Qiao Nian away.

Song Yue’s mind was a little muddled from the beating. Her ears were buzzing, and clear finger marks appeared on her face.

Lu Zhu, who was lying on the hospital bed, stared at Qiao Nian’s back. At this moment, her hands were tightly clenched into fists, trembling slightly, and she exuded a murderous aura.

Lu Zhu’s eyes darkened. For some reason, he had a feeling that Qiao Nian was attacking Song Yue because of him.

Song Yue finally regained her senses. She covered her face, her eyes red with anger. “Who do you think you are? How dare you hit me!”

Bam!

Another sharp slap.

Song Yue rolled her eyes and almost fainted. She collapsed in the wheelchair and panted heavily.

Qiao Nian’s hand also hurt a little. She looked at Song Yue’s sorry state and said coldly, “I was going to settle the score with you, but now you’ve come knocking on my door. If you hadn’t done those dirty things, Lu Zhu wouldn’t have been shot. He wouldn’t have been in the operating room for six hours and almost lost his life. Song Yue, how dare you come here and shout?”

Lu Zhu’s dark eyes moved slightly. His thin lips pursed into a pale line.

It really wasn’t an illusion.

When Xu Qian heard Qiao Nian’s words, she was stunned.

Both Qiao Nian and Song Yue seemed to be telling the truth. Qiao Nian was especially angry and she seemed to be angry because Lu Zhu was injured. Song Yue seemed to be angry because she was indignant.

At this moment, Xu Qian did not know who to believe.

Since she could not figure it out, she did not bother to think about it. The grudges of a wealthy family were not something a young nurse like her could understand.

Song Yue gritted her teeth and said, “Qiao Nian, I’m injured now and can’t hit you. Let me tell you, you’ll definitely regret it in the future!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Qiao Nian’s foxy eyes narrowed coldly. She grabbed Song Yue’s chin and tightened her grip. Her eyes were filled with killing intent as she said coldly, “I’ve already hit you lightly. Even if I kill you now, what can you do?”

Song Yue was in so much pain that tears streamed down her face. She looked at Qiao Nian anxiously.

Seeing Song Yue like this, Qiao Nian frowned and shook her off. “Get lost!”

Xu Qian did not dare to stay here any longer and hurriedly pushed Song Yue back.

Qiao Nian closed the door behind her.

She was not in the mood to deal with Song Yue now. When they reached An City, she would definitely not be soft-hearted.

“Does your hand hurt?” Lu Zhu’s cold voice came from the side.

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Zhu’s voice, the killing intent in her eyes instantly disappeared. She turned around and smiled lightly. “I’m fine!”

“Why don’t you use your foot next time?”

Qiao Nian was slightly taken aback. Her lips curled into a smile.

So Lu Zhu could joke too.

Qiao Nian nodded. “Okay!”

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.

Lu Zhu recovered very quickly. He could already get out of bed and move around. His expression was much better than before.
