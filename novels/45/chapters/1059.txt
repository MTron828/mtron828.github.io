1060 Then Go to Hell!

“Then go to hell!”

Bai Hui’s voice was as cold as ever, and there was impatience in her tone, as if she really wanted Gu Zhou to die.

Qiao Nian and Yu Chu looked at Bai Hui in disbelief. Neither of them had expected Bai Hui to say such terrifying words to Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou stood there with his usual expression. He was already used to it.

Qiao Nian’s heart felt as if it had been stabbed by a needle. It was so painful that it was difficult to breathe. She lowered her gaze, trying hard to remain calm.

In a daze, she recalled Zhou Zhou again.

She still remembered Zhou Zhou’s obsession with eating candy.

She still remembered that Zhou Zhou would ask her, “Does Nian Nian not want Zhou Zhou?” Zhou Zhou felt aggrieved, inferior, and insecure.

What left the deepest impression on Qiao Nian was that on that stormy night in MY, Zhou Zhou was squatting at the door of her room, drenched.

She had initially thought that Gu Zhou was insecure because he had been treated as a medicine to treat Gu Yue when he was young.

But now, it seemed that things were not as she had thought. It was very likely that Gu Zhou had created Zhou Zhou because of his mother’s ruthlessness.

Qiao Nian took a deep breath. She took a step forward and held Gu Zhou’s hand tightly. She looked at Bai Hui calmly. “Hello, Madam Bai.”

Bai Hui frowned imperceptibly. She hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to call her that.

Qiao Nian looked up and her gaze fell calmly on Bai Hui’s face. She enunciated each word clearly. “Biologically speaking, you’re my husband’s mother. If I marry him, I should follow my husband and call you Mom.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

A trace of disdain flashed in Bai Hui’s eyes.

Qiao Nian continued, “Even if you don’t accept me, according to traditional etiquette, I should call you Auntie. However, I don’t think you need my respect. In that case, I’ll call you Madam Bai.”

Bai Hui met Qiao Nian’s charming eyes. Those eyes were exactly the same as Su Yan’s fox-like eyes.

At the thought of Su Yan, Bai Hui’s expression turned cold. She clenched her right fist tightly, her nails digging into her palm. She was so angry that her lips were trembling. She immediately pursed her lips.

“Since Madam Bai thinks that we’re not family, things will be easier to handle. We won’t have to pretend to be polite anymore. In the future, just treat it as if we have nothing to do with each other. After a hundred years, your funeral ceremony won’t be our problem too,” Qiao Nian said calmly.

Bai Hui looked at Qiao Nian sinisterly.

The people of Country Z valued what would happen a hundred years later. If her daughter-in-law did not attend her funeral, wouldn’t that be a slap to her face in public?

According to Qiao Nian, she didn’t intend to support her.

Bai Hui wasn’t old and helpless. Moreover, she didn’t need anyone to support her at all.

However, Qiao Nian’s attitude, her every word, and her every gaze made her feel very uncomfortable.

“Are you threatening me?” Bai Hui questioned, raising her eyebrows. She was very displeased with Qiao Nian’s attitude.

Qiao Nian smiled gently, as if she wasn’t displeased at all. She said, “How can this be a threat? Madam Bai, I’m clearly just stating a fact.”

Without waiting for Bai Hui to speak, Qiao Nian continued, “As Gu Zhou’s wife, I’m doing all this because my heart aches for my husband.”

Bai Hui frowned.

The beauty frowned. She was still good-looking.

Qiao Nian could tell that Bai Hui seemed to care a lot about her words. She took the opportunity to add fuel to the fire. “By the way, you’re not qualified to care about him, because he’s never been in your eyes.”

“You…”

Bai Hui’s defense was broken. She was so angry that her face turned red. She yearned to slap Qiao Nian.

“Madam Bai.” Qiao Nian interrupted Bai Hui coldly and continued, “I’m not interested in being a widow, so I don’t want my husband to be killed by you. Since you love to control other people’s lives, you can just raise some mindless things. There’s no need to use your identity as a mother to suppress others. This is really too low-level.”

Bai Hui’s gaze changed a few times, until there was only coldness left. She yearned to slap Qiao Nian to death. She tried hard to control her temper, her eyes filled with coldness.

“Gu Zhou, your wife is really too rude. Being with her will only lower your status.”
