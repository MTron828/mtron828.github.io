Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, everyone was stunned and stood there in shock.

Even Qiao Yu, who was standing beside Qiao Nian, was stunned.

In the major banks, red membership cards represented the highest-level card types. Generally speaking, those with red cards were worth at least ten billion.

This meant that Qiao Nian was worth tens of billions.

Everyone was confused.

Song Yue stood rooted to the ground, staring at Qiao Nian in disbelief.

How was that possible?

Her father was an executive at the bank, but even her father wasn’t qualified to apply for a red card. How could Qiao Nian be qualified to apply for a red card?

That meant that this card wasn’t Qiao Nian’s.

Qiao Nian was just a country bumpkin. Even the Qiao family couldn’t possibly have so much money.

Lu Zhu, who was standing not far away, was also stunned.

Gao Hong’s face alternated between green and white. She felt as if a slap had landed on her face, and she took two steps back in shock.

It took Song Yue a while to react. She still didn’t believe that Qiao Nian had a red card. Her gaze landed on Lu Zhu’s face, and she instantly reacted. With a dissatisfied expression, she asked, “Brother Lu Zhu, how could you give her your card?”

......

When everyone heard Qiao Yue’s words, they instantly reacted.

So this red card belonged to Lu Zhu!

That made sense.

How could a small model have a red card?

It would be normal if the red card was Lu Zhu’s.

Qiao Nian was really an interesting person. She was pretending to be rich with someone else’s card. Wasn’t she embarrassed?

Just as everyone was about to say something about Qiao Nian, they saw Lu Zhu take out a red card from his wallet.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but laugh when she saw how everyone looked as if they had just eaten shit.

Song Yue was shocked. She couldn’t believe her eyes.

Everyone was also stunned.

Oh my god, Qiao Nian really had a red card!

How could someone with a red card be just a wild model?

She was clearly a low-key tycoon!

They were really impressed!

Everyone acted like cowards and did not dare to say a word.

Gao Hong’s breathing quickened, and her heart raced. She tried not to faint.

Song Yue’s body trembled involuntarily, as if a slap had landed on her face.

However, Qiao Nian still stood there calmly, her face looking even more beautiful.

However, no one dared to step forward.

The cutter took the red card with trembling hands, as if it weighed millions of kilograms.

The cutting master’s gaze landed on the host’s face not far away. The host also looked shocked, because he did not know if he should take 300 million or 310 million.

A trace of shock flashed across the host’s face, but h quickly regained his usual smile and said, “Miss Qiao, these untrimmed quarry stones have already been priced. How can I have the cheek to charge you 10 million more?”

You!

Look, now that the host knew that Qiao Nian had a red card, he instantly addressed her respectfully.

Moreover, the way the host addressed Qiao Nian instantly elevated her status.

The cutter instantly knew what to do. He silently swiped his card and respectfully handed it to Qiao Nian.

Hence, this raw stone became Qiao Nian’s.

Song Yue, who was standing at the side, clenched her fists tightly. At this moment, she realized a problem.

Her status and Qiao Nian’s were on completely different levels.

Previously, she had been dissatisfied with what Qiao Nian had done to her on the plane. Now, she could only secretly rejoice that Qiao Nian had not done anything more vicious to her.

Song Yue had a bad feeling. She didn’t want to stay here anymore purely because she didn’t want to embarrass herself anymore.

However, Song Yue couldn’t afford to offend Jiang Chi, so she could only stay here shamelessly.

There was only one round left. She had to help Jiang Chi get the Moon Goddess!

Hence, under everyone’s uneasy gazes, this raw stone was cut open.
