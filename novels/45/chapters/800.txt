801 Child Support

Su Xue naturally knew that the widow next door would never get pregnant out of wedlock. She didn’t understand where that young lady had come from.

Actually, that young lady was Qiao Nian.

At that time, the young lady had many scars on her face and her forehead was injured.

At that time, she was a little puzzled. She walked over and was about to ask where the young lady’s family was. She didn’t expect the young lady to hug her thigh and call her Mom.

At that time, Su Xue hurriedly explained that she was not the young lady’s mother, but the young lady refused to listen to anything she said and still called her mother.

In the end, the young lady finally believed her. Knowing that she wasn’t her mother, she stood there dejectedly.

Su Xue asked the young lady, “Do you remember where your house is? I’ll send you back!”

The young lady shook her head, looking as if she couldn’t remember anything.

“Then do you remember your name?”

This time, the young lady thought for a long time before saying, “Nian Nian…”

Seeing the young lady like this, Su Xue knew that she couldn’t remember anything.

This young lady was also carrying a school bag. Su Xue opened her school bag, wanting to help the young lady find clues about her family.

When Su Xue opened her school bag, she saw a letter placed at the top.

“Sister Wang, this young lady has already lost her memory. Previously, I’ve been looking for someone who can adopt her. I heard that you’re a very kind person. I want to entrust this child to you. I hope you can take good care of her. Her birthday is on the 16th of August. I have many important things to do now. After I’m done with these, I’ll take her away on her birthday next year. There’s also a six million cheque I’ve prepared for you in my bag. This is the child support fee for this young lady. Thank you!”

Six million.

When Su Xue saw the check, her eyes lit up.

Previously, she had secretly embezzled a million yuan of the company’s public funds. If she had this six million yuan, she could return the company’s public funds and have five million yuan in her private savings!

In the past, Su Xue had heard from others that pies would fall from the sky. This time, she really believed it.

The way Su Xue looked at the young lady changed. It wasn’t difficult to raise a child.

With that thought in mind, Su Xue squatted in front of the young lady. A gentle smile appeared on her face as she said, “Nian Nian, Mom won’t joke with you anymore. Let’s go. Mom will bring you home!”

Then, Su Xue picked the young lady up and brought her back to her house before Sister Wang opened the door.

The young lady seemed to have suffered some major trauma in the past. Not only had she lost her memory, but she was also especially dependent on her.

No matter where she went, the young lady would follow her.

Due to this six million yuan, Su Xue found this young lady very pleasing to the eye.

When she returned to An City again, she brought the young lady back with her.

She told Qiao Shan that the young lady had been picked up in the countryside. She had no parents and felt that this young lady was very pitiful, so she brought her back.

Worried that Qiao Shan wouldn’t be willing to adopt this child, Su Xue even made up an excuse.

This young lady’s birth chart was very good. She was very suitable to be Qiao Yu’s child bride. This way, Qiao Yu’s life would be very smooth-sailing when he grew up. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Qiao Shan cared a lot about his son. When he heard Su Xue’s words, he acknowledged the young lady without hesitation. To the Qiao family, raising a child was not difficult.

Moreover, this young lady could make his son’s life go smoothly. Qiao Shan did not want anything to happen to his son in the future.

After Su Xue filled up the company’s shortfall, she used the remaining money as her private savings.

Qiao Nian sat on the sofa. Seeing that Su Xue was silent, her frown deepened. Annoyed, she said coldly, “Looks like you’ve really fallen for your gigolo. You want to spend the rest of your life with him!”

Su Xue suddenly looked up, her gaze landing on Qiao Nian’s face. Helplessly, she compromised. “I’ll tell you. I’ll tell you everything!”

Su Xue briefly organized her thoughts.

She definitely couldn’t say that she embezzled funds, nor could she say that she had already kept a gigolo more than twenty years ago.

It was even more impossible for her to tell Qiao Nian that she had received six million yuan in child support.

At the thought of this, Su Xue sighed and said slowly, “I found you in Soul City!”
