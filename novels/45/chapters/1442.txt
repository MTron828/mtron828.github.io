A white van stopped beside Lina’s car. A person got out of the back seat, holding a dagger. Swiftly, he punctured Lina’s four tires.

Then, the man got into his car swiftly. There was a man with a scar on his face in the car. He glanced at the others in the car, his eyes vicious. “Are you ready?”

The others said in unison, “We’re ready!”

“Let’s go. We have to make her pay the price today!” As the scar-faced man spoke, he was the first to get out of the car.

He looked up at Bear Mountain not far away. The mountain was shrouded in fog. At this time of night, not many people were climbing the mountain.

The scar-faced man’s eyes were malicious, and his face was filled with ferocity.

…

Lina and Qiao Nian continued climbing the mountain.

The air on the mountain was very fresh, giving off a refreshing feeling.

Qiao Nian usually practiced Tai Chi every morning. Her physique was very good, so climbing the mountain wasn’t tiring for her.

Qiao Nian glanced at Lina, who was beside her. Lina was the princess of Europe, but her expression was as usual. She didn’t look tired at all.

It seemed that Lina usually exercised a lot.

Seeing Qiao Nian looking at her, Lina paused for a moment and asked considerately, “Nian Nian, are you tired? Do you want us to rest for a while?”

“I’m not tired.” Qiao Nian smiled and shook her head. She looked up at the top of the mountain. The sunlight fell on the clouds, dyeing them with a layer of golden light. She looked up and saw white clouds, golden clouds, and a green bear mountain. The blue sky echoed with each other, making it beautiful. “This place is really beautiful!”

Some scenes could not just be seen on phones or computers. Only by being present could one feel the uncanny workmanship of nature.

Lina turned to look at Qiao Nian. The golden sunlight shone on Qiao Nian, as if her entire body was glowing. His beautiful fox-like eyes were filled with bright stars. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Lina’s pupils dilated uncontrollably. There was actually such a beautiful person in the world?

When she first saw Qiao Nian, she knew that she was good-looking. However, when she looked at Qiao Nian carefully, she felt that the more she looked at her, the prettier she became.

People from the East were good-looking, be it men or women.

With this thought in mind, Lina’s gaze landed on Chen Qing, who was beside Qiao Nian. A hint of surprise flashed across her eyes.

When Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian appeared at the airport, she had realized that the two of them were as beautiful as angels. Later, she had also noticed Chen Qing, who was beside the two of them.

If one were to look at Chen Qing alone, he was also a handsome man.

However, Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou’s appearances overshadowed Chen Qing’s brilliance.

Lina stole another glance at Chen Qing. Her face was slightly red as she lowered her gaze shyly.

“Madam, is there anything wrong?”

Chen Qing’s words pulled Lina out of her thoughts. Lina’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face and she saw Qiao Nian frowning slightly as she looked around.

“Nian Nian, what’s wrong?” Lina asked in confusion.

Qiao Nian glanced around, a trace of confusion flashing in her eyes. She could sense that someone was spying on her, but she wanted to see who was spying on her in the dark. The feeling of being spied on instantly disappeared.

Qiao Nian retracted her gaze and her gaze fell on Chen Qing’s face. She asked, “When we came here today, there didn’t seem to be many people.”

Chen Qing nodded slightly.

Lina smiled and explained, “For the sake of safety, my father has already ordered the scenic area to be sealed off this morning, so we’re the only ones climbing the mountain.”

When Chen Qing heard Lina’s words, he looked at Qiao Nian worriedly. “Madam, what did you discover?”

When Qiao Nian heard Chen Qing’s words, she shook her head gently. Since the scenic area had already been sealed, there shouldn’t be anyone else. She hoped that what she had felt just now was just her imagination.

Lina frowned slightly. She was the princess of Europe. If she went to a scenic spot, her father would often seal it in advance. Not only that, but her father would also get the secret guards to protect her in secret.

Could it be that Qiao Nian had discovered the secret guards hiding in the dark?

Lina’s eyes lit up. She hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to be so sharp!

Lina smiled and walked over to Qiao Nian. “Let’s hurry up and climb the mountain. When the time comes, we’ll be able to see the waterfall under the sunlight!”

“Yeah.” Qiao Nian nodded.
