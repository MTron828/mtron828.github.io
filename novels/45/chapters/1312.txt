1313 Wedding

Qiao Nian sat by Gu Zhou’s bed and lowered her head to peel an orange. Thinking of what Gu Zhou had just said, her lips curved up involuntarily.

Gu Zhou noticed Qiao Nian’s expression and asked in confusion, “What are you thinking about?”

“I was just wondering if he could help Big Brother set up a bigger scene.” Qiao Nian smiled at Gu Zhou and handed the peeled orange to him.

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he smiled and said, “Don’t worry, even if he can’t remember, Big Brother will remind him and make him remember.”

A trace of worry flashed in Gu Zhou’s deep eyes. He hoped that his brother could avert his danger. That was all he could do for his brother!

Gu Zhou took a bite of the orange and turned to look at Qiao Nian. His eyes gradually softened as he said softly, “Nian’er.”

“Yes?”

“I know where Big Brother is.” Gu Zhou finished the orange and wiped his mouth. Only then did he throw the tissue into the trash can at the side. He stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian, who was eating the orange. “The child knows too. Shouldn’t we discuss our matters?”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion. “What matters?”

“When we get back, let’s prepare for the wedding!” Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian with a burning gaze, the love in his eyes almost overflowing. “Let everyone know that you’re Mrs. Gu, and I’m your husband.”

Qiao Nian’s heart trembled violently. She stopped eating the orange and looked into Gu Zhou’s eyes. She knew that Gu Zhou was serious.

The wedding.

No girl wouldn’t yearn for a wedding.

Many people said that a girl’s most beautiful moment was at her wedding.

When she was young, Qiao Nian had also fantasized about her wedding. However, ever since the night she was bullied when she was eighteen, she had never fantasized about a wedding again.

Seeing that Qiao Nian was silent, Gu Zhou reached out and held her hand. He asked softly, “Which kind of wedding would you like?”

Qiao Nian looked at the gentle Gu Zhou in front of her and couldn’t help but smile. She smiled shyly and said, “A Chinese wedding!” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Gu Zhou held Qiao Nian’s hand tightly. A Chinese wedding was a traditional wedding.

“We have to prepare the phoenix coronet and gown first. On the day of the wedding, we’ll have eight palanquins.” At this point, Gu Zhou paused for a moment. “I remember that in ancient times, women would also marry with their dowry on the day of their marriage. When the time comes, I’ll also prepare your dowry for you according to the highest standards. I’ll marry you in a grand manner!”

“When the ceremony begins, we’ll kowtow to the heavens and the earth. Then, we’ll be recognized as husband and wife. I hope that we can be husband and wife for generations to come.” Gu Zhou gently rubbed Qiao Nian’s hand. Seeing the tears in her eyes, he raised his hand and gently wiped them away. “When the time comes, we’ll go to the Three-Lives Stone and engrave our names.”

Qiao Nian was only fantasizing about the scene Gu Zhou had described. Her eyes were hot, and her tears were about to fall. She moved slightly closer to Gu Zhou and carefully avoided his wound, taking the initiative to hug him.

“Yes.” At this point, Qiao Nian got up from Gu Zhou’s arms and sat back down on the chair. There was a faint smile on her face. “But Mr. Gu, aren’t you going a little too far!”

“Huh?” Gu Zhou was puzzled.

“Are you proposing?” Qiao Nian pursed her lips and asked seriously, staring unblinkingly at Gu Zhou.

“Will you marry me?” Gu Zhou didn’t answer Qiao Nian’s question directly. He stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian, feeling very nervous.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou and sniffled. Her voice was choked as she nodded. “Yes. Although there’s no diamond ring or romantic scene, as long as you propose to me, I’m willing to marry you no matter what!”

Seeing Qiao Nian look away and silently wipe her tears, Gu Zhou’s heart instantly softened.

Before Qiao Nian appeared in his life, he had never thought that he would fall in love with a woman.

He regretted not giving Qiao Nian a complete and beautiful wedding previously. If he could do it all over again, he would definitely let Qiao Nian marry into the Gu family in glory and write Qiao Nian’s name on the Gu family tree. He wanted to take Qiao Nian to the ends of the earth and leave their traces. He wanted to find the Three-Lives Stone and engrave their names, hoping that they would never be separated for the rest of their lives!
