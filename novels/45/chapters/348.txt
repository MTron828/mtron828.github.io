Chapter 349: A Little Fun

Lu Nian handed the helmet to her and asked, “Are you planning to go to the charity banquet too?”

Qiao Nian smiled and nodded. “Yes.”

“Alone?”

“Yes.” Qiao Nian nodded. Her relationship with Gu Zhou had yet to be made public, so she could only travel alone.

Lu Nian’s lips curved up slightly as he said, “What a coincidence. I’m missing a female companion. Hold on tight!”

“Okay!”

The motorcycle sped through the gap between the cars. In less than ten minutes, it passed the traffic jam.

In just half an hour, the two of them arrived at the charity banquet.

The motorcycle drew a beautiful arc on the ground, then stopped.

Perhaps it was because the motorcycle’s noise was too loud, but there was no way to keep a low profile.

The moment they entered the venue, they instantly attracted the attention of most people.

“It’s actually the version of a racing bike that’s no longer for sale!”

“It really is!”

“I wonder which big shot has arrived!”

…

Just as everyone was feeling curious, Qiao Nian got out of the car and handed the helmet to Lu Nian. Lu Nian also took off the helmet.

“Oh my god, that girl is Mr. Dong Hua’s female musician. I’ve seen her before. I can’t be wrong!”

“Who’s the man standing beside him? He’s so beautiful!”

“Even a man like me is tempted.”

“The two of them look like a match made in heaven!”

…

Chen Qing instantly felt the air around him turn colder. Without looking, he knew that Second Master was angry. He swallowed nervously. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Just as Chen Qing was feeling uneasy, he saw Qiao Nian holding Lu Nian’s hand openly. Under everyone’s gaze, the two of them walked towards them.

Chen Qing’s eyelids twitched. Second Young Madam had not picked up the phone just now, and now she had become Lu Nian’s female companion. Second Young Madam was playing with fire on purpose!

Chen Qing’s heart skipped a beat.

Today, he went to school with Second Master and asked Gu Qi about his WeChat.

Gu Qi said that his previous form teacher had deleted all his WeChat friends. He even said that the principal had already expelled the form teacher.

Second Master Gu asked him to investigate the identity and background of the new teacher. He was relieved when he found no problems.

After leaving school, Second Young Master Gu called Second Young Madam, but she didn’t pick up.

Qiao Nian felt Gu Zhou’s gaze on her. She looked up and gave him a bright smile.

When Qiao Nian and Lu Nian walked up to Gu Zhou, she greeted politely, “Mr. Gu!”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s voice, he frowned. It had been a long time since he had heard this form of address from Qiao Nian.

Lu Nian sensed a trace of anger.

However, he didn’t let go of Qiao Nian. In his opinion, Second Brother and Qiao Nian were secretly married. As his younger brother, he naturally had to help hide the truth.

The other guests seemed to have noticed the strange look in Gu Zhou’s eyes. They all looked over, wanting to see if there was any gossip.

Seeing Qiao Nian’s bright smile, Gu Zhou’s dark brown eyes darkened. He stared at Qiao Nian meaningfully for a long while before speaking.

“Doctor Qiao, have you forgotten something?” Gu Zhou’s voice was low and hoarse. It was extremely pleasant to the ear.

Doctor Qiao?

When Qiao Nian heard this form of address, her heart began to race for some reason. She smiled at Gu Zhou, trying hard to remain calm. “Mr. Gu, I wonder if you’ll still have time after the charity banquet. Can I go to the Gu family to treat you?”

“Thank you, Doctor Qiao.”

When he said the words “Doctor Qiao”, Gu Zhou’s tone intensified.

Qiao Nian’s ears burned.

Lu Nian thought that this couple really knows how to have fun.

Could it be that he had been single for too long and didn’t understand the pleasures of marriage?
