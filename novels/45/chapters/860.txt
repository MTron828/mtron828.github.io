861 Something’s Wrong

Qiao Nian didn’t take Song Man’s words to heart at all. Her gaze fell on Xiao Shi’s face. For some reason, she had a bad feeling that something was wrong.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian called out tentatively, “Xiao Shi?”

Xiao Shi still slept soundly. She did not move or respond.

Qiao Nian’s frown deepened. Xiao Shi was really too abnormal.

With this thought in mind, she walked to the bed and was about to test the temperature of Xiao Shi’s forehead when her hand was slapped away by Song Man.

“What are you doing?” Song Man looked at Qiao Nian warily, as if she was very worried that Qiao Nian would snatch Xiao Shi away from her.

Qiao Nian frowned and looked at Song Man coldly. “Xiao Shi’s condition is very wrong. I’m a doctor. I want to examine her!”

When Song Man heard Qiao Nian’s words, she was so angry that she laughed. She questioned angrily, “There’s nothing wrong with Xiao Shi today. She even ate a lot at noon. Don’t spout nonsense here. Miss Qiao, I don’t know what you’re thinking. Xiao Shi is my daughter. I care about her very much. I won’t allow you to touch my daughter casually! What right do you have to touch my daughter?”

“Now isn’t the time to let your emotions affect you. Xiao Shi’s condition isn’t good. I need to examine her properly,” Qiao Nian explained. Just as she was about to pull Song Man away, she saw Song Man shielding Xiao Shi under her.

“I’ve said it before. Xiao Shi is my daughter. You don’t have to interfere. You’re not allowed to snatch my daughter!” Song Man looked at Qiao Nian with red eyes, as if Qiao Nian was a heinous human trafficker who wanted to kill Xiao Shi.

Qiao Nian was about to step forward and pull Song Man away when she heard Gu Zhou say, “Get up and let Nian’er examine Xiao Shi!”

“On what basis?” Song Man questioned tearfully. “Xiao Shi is my daughter. How can I harm her? She’s the child I’ve been pregnant with for ten months and painstakingly gave birth to. Why are you separating me from my flesh and blood with just a word? You’re simply too much. You don’t treat ordinary people like us as humans at all!”

Towards the end, Song Man’s tears flowed down readily as if she had suffered greatly. “I only wanted Xiao Shi to look for her grandparents. I never thought of meeting you at all. If I had known that your appearance would mean that you would snatch Xiao Shi away, I would have lived in Hai Cheng for the rest of my life instead of taking half a step into An City!”

Song Man looked at Qiao Nian angrily and said tearfully, “If you want a child, go ahead and give birth yourself. Don’t snatch someone else’s child. I have nothing left. I only have Xiao Shi!”

When Gu Zhou heard Song Man’s words, he was not moved at all. He felt that Song Man was really too annoying. He felt that Xiao Shi’s expression was indeed a little ugly. “Xiao Shi’s condition is not good now! What did you do to Xiao Shi?”

When Song Man heard Gu Zhou’s words, she was stunned. Just as she was about to speak, Qiao Nian pulled her aside.

Qiao Nian sat by Xiao Shi’s bed with a serious expression. She carefully checked Xiao Shi’s pulse, then her eyes. Then, her expression instantly darkened.

Gu Zhou naturally knew Qiao Nian’s every expression. He looked at Song Man coldly. “What exactly did you do?”

Seeing Gu Zhou looking at her with teary eyes, Song Man said with red-rimmed eyes, “What can I do? Xiao Shi just caught a cold. I asked her to take some cold medicine. There are sleeping pills in cold medicine to begin with. It’s normal for her to sleep until now. I’m her biological mother, so I’m naturally very concerned about her!”

Seeing that Gu Zhou didn’t trust her, Song Man couldn’t help but get emotional. “All these years, mother and daughter have relied on each other. If it weren’t for me, she would have been gone long ago. She’s everything to me. How can I not treat her well?” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Gu Zhou glanced at Song Man coldly and said, “That’d better be the case.”

At this moment, Qiao Nian had already finished examining Xiao Shi. Her face was a little pale, and her hand holding Xiao Shi was trembling slightly.
