Chapter 177 You Only Have One Older Sister

Seeing Lu Qi’s smile, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but smile as well. Her mood was now much better than usual. “You don’t have to treat me like an outsider. Just call me by my given name.”

Lu Qi’s eyes lit up. “You’re older than me. I’ll call you Sister Nian Nian, okay?”

Suddenly, an aged voice came from the side.

“Qi Qi, you only have one elder sister!”

Qiao Nian looked over and saw an old lady with white hair. She appeared to be reserved and taciturn, unlike Matriarch Gu’s natural amiability.

Lu Qi’s expression turned awkward. She quickly said, “Nian Nian, this is my grandmother.”

Lu Qi had changed the way she addressed Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian smiled at Matriarch Lu and greeted politely, “Madam Lu, how do you do?”

When Matriarch Lu heard Qiao Nian’s voice, she shifted her gaze to Qiao Nian, sizing her up. Then, she nodded indifferently. “So you’re Professor Qiao Nian. I heard from Qi Qi that you’re a knowledgeable young lady.” After exchanging a few pleasantries, Qiao Nian took a good look at Matriarch Lu. Her lips were pale, and the whites of her eyes were slightly yellow. Qiao Nian narrowed her beautiful fox-like eyes, frowning a little. “Madam Lu, have you been feeling unwell lately?”

Matriarch Lu was stunned for a moment.

“Do you have any difficulty breathing in the middle of the night, or feel that your chest is tight?” Qiao Nian asked solemnly.

When Matriarch Lu heard Qiao Nian’s words, a trace of surprise flashed in her eyes. She nodded. “A little lately.”

Qiao Nian seemed to be deep in thought. She continued asking, “Do you feel a swelling pain in your temples? Is your back perspiring? Do the soles of your feet feel like they’re burning?”

Matriarch Lu’s gaze softened as she looked at Qiao Nian. She had long heard that some doctors could tell a person’s health condition just by looking at their physiognomy. Now, it seemed that Qiao Nian was truly capable. “A little.”

Qiao Nian’s expression turned serious. She turned to look at Lu Qi and said, “Hurry up and take Madam Lu to the hospital for a neurological examination. Also, do a full body examination.”

Lu Qi’s face turned pale in fear.

Matriarch Lu was indeed someone who had weathered many storms. She stood there unmoving, the expression on her face unchanging

“Also, take Grandma Lu to do a liver and heart examination. Make sure the doctors examine her thoroughly. This can’t be delayed any longer.” Qiao Nian was frowning as she spoke.

Frightened, Lu Qi gripped Matriarch Lu’s hand tightly. She looked at Qiao Nian in fear and unease. “Nian Nian, did you just say that my grandmother’s health…”

Qiao Nian herself was also hoping that she had misdiagnosed Matriarch Lu. Pursing her lips, she said, “Madam Lu’s complexion doesn’t look too good. I suspect that there might be something wrong with her liver. Moreover, elderly people tend to have heart problems as well. It’s better to go for an examination.”

Lu Qi nodded solemnly.

“However, Matriarch Lu might have a cerebral infarction right now. We have to nip this illness in the bud,” Qiao Nian said sternly. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Lu Qi’s slim body swayed on the spot. There was no trace of blood on her face. If someone else had said that about Grandma, she would definitely step forward to argue with that person.

However, when she saw Qiao Nian’s expression of certainty, she couldn’t bring herself to doubt Qiao Nian’s words. She pulled Matriarch Lu’s arm, ready to bring her to the hospital.

Matriarch Lu herself was much calmer. She was thinking about something else. She stopped Lu Qi and said, “We’ve already arrived at the temple. Pray for your sister first. It’s fine if I go to the hospital after that. I’m getting old. It’s normal for me to have some health problems.”

“Grandma!” Lu Qi frowned, pouting. “This won’t do. Come with me quickly. We’re going to the hospital now. If Sister finds out that you put off going to the hospital just to pray for her, she’ll definitely be unhappy!”

A trace of hesitation flashed across Matriarch Lu’s face. In the end, she couldn’t dissuade Lu Qi and could only follow her to the hospital.

Qiao Nian watched as the two of them left and heaved a sigh of relief. Only then did she relax.

When Qiao Nian got home, she took a shower and changed her clothes. She had just stepped out of the bathroom when she heard a knock on the door. She walked over and opened the door to see Gu Zhou standing there.
