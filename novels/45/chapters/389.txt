Chapter 390: Ancestral Hall

Actually, Jiang Yue had her own selfish motives. She didn’t want others to know that Brother Ah Zhou and Qiao Nian were already married.

Moreover, she hoped that when Brother Zhou was willing to announce his marriage to the outside world, she would be the one standing beside him.

She wanted to become the Second Madam of the Gu family.

When Song Yu heard Jiang Yue’s words, she understood and said, “No wonder I saw her coming to the Lu family with Old Madam Gu last time!”

Jiang Yue’s eyes flickered. Song Yu was probably referring to the day of Eldest Miss Lu’s death anniversary. Qiao Nian must have been there to deliver a gift.

A faint smile appeared on Jiang Yue’s face as she said, “She embroidered the word “fortune” beautifully on the bag.”

Hearing Jiang Yue’s words, Song Yu instantly had an impression.

That day, she had seen an exquisite bag on the urn. She hadn’t expected it to be embroidered by Qiao Nian.

Not long after, the car arrived at the entrance of the Gu family’s villa.

Jiang Yue smiled and unbuckled her seatbelt. She asked politely, “Sister Song Yu, do you want to come in for a cup of tea before leaving?”

Song Yu glanced at the time and shook her head with a smile. “It’s really too late now. It’s not convenient for me to disturb Old Madam Gu. I’ll visit another day!”

“Yes, thank you, Sister Song Yu, for sending me back.”

“We sisters are already so familiar with each other. There’s no need to stand on ceremony!”

......

After Jiang Yue got out of the car, Song Yu drove off.

Jiang Yue stood where she was and watched Song Yu’s car leave. Her beautiful eyes narrowed slightly, filled with envy.

Although Song Yu was only the adopted daughter of the Lu family, Lu Zhu acknowledged her existence. Song Yu’s status in the Lu family was much higher than hers in the Gu family.

When Jiang Yue saw Song Yu’s car disappear around the corner, she retracted her thoughts and turned to walk in.

Jiang Yue had just walked to the living room and was about to go upstairs when she saw Gu Zhou walking down with a dark expression.

Gu Zhou looked at Jiang Yue coldly and said, “Jiang Yue, come with me!”

At this moment, Jiang Yue’s heart skipped a beat when she saw Qiao Nian standing on the stairs on the second floor. Instantly, a chill ran down her spine, and she found it difficult to breathe.

Jiang Yue recalled what Qiao Nian had said at the hotel. She hesitated for a moment, then pursed her lips and said, “Brother Ah Zhou, it’s a little late now. Why don’t we wait until tomorrow?” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Gu Zhou did not say anything and continued walking downstairs.

Jiang Yue stood rooted to the ground, not knowing what to do.

Qiao Nian walked down from above and glanced at Jiang Yue indifferently. She then walked down calmly. It seemed that Jiang Yue was going to suffer tonight.

Trembling with fear, Jiang Yue followed Qiao Nian into the ancestral hall. Her palm felt cold. Just as she was about to offer incense, she heard Gu Zhou speak coldly.

“You don’t have to offer incense.”

Jiang Yue silently retracted her hand, feeling a little awkward.

“In case it dirties the ancestral hall,” Gu Zhou said coldly.

Jiang Yue’s face was pale. She pursed her lips and asked carefully, “Brother Ah Zhou, why are we here so late?”

“If I remember correctly, it was Grandma who brought you here to tell the Gu family’s ancestors that she wanted you to be her god-granddaughter. Do you remember?”

When Jiang Yue heard Gu Zhou’s question, she nodded seriously. Grandma had acknowledged her as her god-granddaughter. That day was a turning point in her life, and she would never forget it for the rest of her life.

“Then do you remember what you promised in the first place?”

Jiang Yue nodded.

“Then say it again now.”

Gu Zhou’s voice was like a demon from hell, making Jiang Yue feel cold. She looked at Gu Zhou uneasily and bit her lip. “I’ll take good care of Grandma, I won’t do anything that will damage the Gu family’s reputation, and I won’t hurt anyone in my family. I’ll never forget my original intention!”

“Then did you do it?” Gu Zhou looked at Jiang Yue intently, his voice as calm as water.
