Chapter 1729 - 1729 Don't

Before Lina could make a sound, Via, who had been kneeling at the side and crying, suddenly rejoiced. She quickly got up from the ground and shouted emotionally. “Mr. Chen!”

Lina’s eyes lit up again. Just as she was about to speak, she saw Chen Qing turn back to look at her.

“You…”

Before Lina could finish speaking, Chen Qing picked her up in his arms and placed her on the sofa not far away.

“How did you…” Lina’s eyes were red as she looked at Chen Qing worriedly. Wasn’t he afraid of danger? He had actually rushed over now.

When Chen Qing met Lina’s gaze, it was as if a knife had stabbed into his heart. He was in so much pain that he wanted to die. He pursed his lips slightly and interrupted Lina softly. “Wait for me.”

His heart ached terribly. When he saw her pitiful and helpless state outside the window just now, he regretted that his ability was limited and he couldn’t protect her well.

Seeing that Lina still wanted to say something, Chen Qing said gently, “Don’t worry, you’ll be fine.”

Lina looked at Chen Qing in a daze and nodded blankly.

Chen Qing turned around and walked towards Wright.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

When Wright saw Chen Qing, there was a sinister smile on his face. He raised his eyebrows slightly and raised his hand to applaud arrogantly. “I didn’t expect Mr. Chen to be so bold as to barge into my ancient castle alone. The timing was perfect. If you had been a step later, Lina would have been naked in front of us.”

Wright paused for a moment and continued, “Have you been hiding outside all this time, not daring to show your face?”

With that, Wright glanced at Lina, who was sitting not far away. He seemed to be sowing discord.

Lina wrapped the blanket around her tightly and looked at Wright not far away with a dark expression. She wanted to tear Wright into pieces.

Chen Qing warmed up his wrists and shoulders with a cold expression. Without hesitation, he punched Wright. “If you’re a man, you should solve the problem like a man and not make things difficult for a girl.”

Wright staggered back a few steps from Chen Qing’s attack. There was blood at the corner of his mouth. He finally stabilized himself and raised his hand to wipe the blood from his mouth.

Yesterday, at the engagement banquet, Chen Qing had punched him. Now, Chen Qing had punched him again.

He had always been petty. This time, he wanted Chen Qing to know that he was not someone he could afford to offend.

“Fight?” Wright smiled sinisterly. He leisurely took out the gun in his hand and mocked, “I have a gun. Why should I fight you?”

He was no match for Chen Qing. If he could solve a problem with a gun, why did he have to get physical?

Wright aimed the gun between Chen Qing’s eyebrows, his eyes filled with a smug smile. “Goodbye!”

With that, Wright fired.

However, the gun shattered the glass not far away.

Before Wright could react, Chen Qing was already standing beside him. He snatched the gun from his hand and aimed it at his temple.

Chen Qing pointed the gun at Wright’s temple. He walked up to Wright and aimed the gun at his brow.

“Your skills are a little bad!” Chen Qing said coldly. Thinking of how Lina had been bullied just now, he placed his finger on the trigger. He wanted this beast to go straight to hell.

At this moment, Lina’s anxious voice rang out. “No, you can’t shoot. Chen Qing, if you shoot, you might not be able to leave.”

Lina’s eyes turned red. She looked at Chen Qing worriedly. So what if she lost her dignity? She didn’t want Chen Qing to be hurt at all. She just hoped that Chen Qing could live well.

Chen Qing stopped what he was doing and looked at Wright.

At this moment, Wright seemed to have already arrived at the gates of hell. He tried hard to take a deep breath and looked at Chen Qing in fear.

He felt as if he had already died once. Chen Qing’s gaze just now was really terrifying.

If Lina hadn’t spoken up, he might have really died.

Chen Qing was really bold!
