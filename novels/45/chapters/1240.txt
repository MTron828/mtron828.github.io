No?

Xiao Bao’s young face was filled with confusion. He hurriedly shook his head and said, “There must be such a martial art. Uncle Zhao, it must be because you’re old that you don’t know these things. Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone that you don’t know what such an impressive and awesome martial art is called!”

He was getting old!

Butler Zhao felt a shock in his heart. He was clearly only in his thirties. How was he old!

The kind of martial arts that Little Master was talking about did not exist at all. Little Master probably did not see it clearly!

In the living room of the villa.

Jiang Yue’s expression turned even colder. She said to the four bodyguards around her, who did not dare to step forward, “Hurry up and attack. Do you not want to take the reward anymore?”

At the thought of the money Jiang Yue was going to give them, the four of them looked at each other and immediately clenched their fists and rushed towards Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian stood in the middle of the four of them. The disdain in her eyes showed her current attitude. She gripped the silver needles tightly with both hands and swiftly dodged the attacks of the four of them.

The four of them hit themselves like fools.

Qiao Nian dodged their attacks. She swiftly circled back and inserted a few needles into the four of them without hesitation.

Like deflated balloons, the four men instantly lost their strength and collapsed into a pile.

Qiao Nian didn’t hit them hard. She just made them feel weak. She didn’t have that much energy to fight so many people.

Jiang Yue looked at the bodyguards all over the ground, her face pale with fear. She had never expected Qiao Nian to be so skilled. Her expression instantly turned cold.

Just as Jiang Yue was thinking about how to escape, she sensed a cold gaze on her. She subconsciously looked over and saw Qiao Nian’s beautiful fox-like eyes filled with coldness as she walked towards her.

She had clearly found so many people and made two plans. She clearly felt that she would definitely be able to make Qiao Nian kneel in front of her and apologize!

But why had things changed?

She took a few steps back in a panic, no longer as elegant and calm as before. Her body trembled as she said, “Don’t… don’t come over. I… I’m not afraid of you.”

“Don’t you want to cut off my hands and feet and put me in the fish tank as human swine? You even want me to be your test subject.” Qiao Nian looked at Jiang Yue sinisterly, as if she was looking at an ant. “Since you don’t have time to do this, let me do this. I’ll turn you into a human swine and put you in the fish tank. I’ll treat you very well. I won’t let you be my test subject. After all, you’re not even human. I’ll inject a milliliter of formalin into the fish tank every minute and let you be a beautiful specimen, okay?”

Formalin?

At the thought of that scene, Jiang Yue couldn’t help but shiver. She looked at Qiao Nian with red-rimmed eyes and said impatiently, “You can’t treat me like this. If you really treat me like this, Brother Ah Zhou will definitely think that you’re very vicious. He won’t like you anymore. Even Grandma will think that you’re a vicious person.”

Seeing that Qiao Nian was still fearless, Jiang Yue shouted in a panic, “That’s against the law!”

She knew very well that she was no match for Qiao Nian. She regretted it now. She shouldn’t have thought of torturing Qiao Nian back then. She should have shot Qiao Nian to death so that Qiao Nian would never be able to show off in front of her for the rest of her life!

However, there was no medicine for regret now.

Seeing Jiang Yue’s panicked expression, Qiao Nian’s lips curved into a cold smile. She questioned, “Miss Jiang, why don’t I understand what you’re saying?”

Jiang Yue blinked in confusion, not understanding what Qiao Nian was trying to do.

Qiao Nian continued, “This isn’t China. This is MY. This isn’t a place where law is important. This is a place where survival depends on capabilities.”

Jiang Yue looked at Qiao Nian in fear and pursed her lips. “But if you kill me, you’ll lose your life. Do you think you’ll be able to sleep well tonight?”

Qiao Nian sneered and said, “You chose to make a move here. Aren’t you afraid that I’ll pester you at night?” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The blood drained from Jiang Yue’s face. At this moment, Takeda had already taken out his pistol and was pointing it at Qiao Nian shakily.
