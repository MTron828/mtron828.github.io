1013 Please Come In!

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she heaved a sigh of relief. She hadn’t expected herself to be so nervous.

Fortunately, Gu Zhou had accompanied her.

Hearing Gu Zhou’s words, Matriarch Lu nodded. The Gu family and the Lu family had always been on good terms, but her expression was still very serious. “Please come in!”

Holding Qiao Nian’s hand, Gu Zhou led her towards the Lu family.

!!

Song Yu looked at Qiao Nian’s expression and lowered her gaze slightly. She had thought that Qiao Nian was a calm woman, but now it seemed that she also had times when she was nervous.

Matriarch Lu’s appearance interrupted all of Lu Zhu’s fantasies of acknowledging her as family. He only wanted to give Qiao Nian a warm scene. Now, he could only take it one step at a time.

It didn’t seem appropriate to reveal Qiao Nian’s identity now.

At this moment, the servants and butler also arrived.

Matriarch Lu was still very angry. She had long set a rule that no firecrackers or fireworks were allowed in the Lu family. Now, someone actually dared to violate her rules.

“Investigate carefully. We have to find out who set off the firecrackers!” Matriarch Lu’s expression turned cold as she said angrily.

Seeing Matriarch Lu’s expression change in anger, Song Yu looked at the butler and said, “Grandma was also shocked today. We have to investigate. When the time comes, we’ll punish the culprit according to the Lu family’s rules!”

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian stopped in their tracks. They looked at each other. Gu Zhou was about to speak, but Lu Zhu spoke first.

“Grandma, I did it. You don’t have to investigate anymore.”

When Matriarch Lu heard Lu Zhu’s words, her expression changed. She looked at Lu Zhu in disbelief.

Lu Zhu cared a lot about Sugar. Moreover, he was the first to propose this rule in the past. Later on, Matriarch Lu abided by this rule.

When Song Yu heard Lu Zhu’s words, her face was filled with surprise. “Brother, didn’t you set this rule? Why did you…”

Lu Zhu said calmly, “Back then, I suggested this rule because Sugar was no longer around.”

Matriarch Lu looked displeased and frowned. “Then why did you break this rule?”

“What if Sugar isn’t dead yet?” At this point, Lu Zhu couldn’t help but glance at Qiao Nian, who was standing not far away. Then, he looked at Matriarch Lu and enunciated each word clearly.

At this moment, not only were Matriarch Lu and Song Yu stunned, but even the butler and servants present were stunned.

Song Yu did not expect Lu Zhu to tell her about this so easily. She instantly became nervous.

She sensed that Matriarch Lu was trembling beside her. She hurriedly stroked Matriarch Lu’s back and comforted her. “Grandma, the doctor said that you can’t be too agitated.”

Matriarch Lu stared unblinkingly at Lu Zhu, her voice trembling. “What… what do you mean by that?”

“Grandma, I…”

Before Lu Zhu could finish speaking, a clear voice interrupted him.

“Grandma, don’t blame Big Brother for this. It’s all my fault.” Lu Qi was holding a bouquet of hyacinths, her eyes filled with joy. “I was the one who set off the fireworks.”

Matriarch Lu was slightly stunned. She looked at Lu Qi in surprise.

Lu Qi had always been obedient and adorable. She had never done anything wrong and was unwilling to be punished. Even when she was about to be punished, she was the fastest to run.

How strange.

Lu Qi actually took the initiative to apologize?

Wasn’t she afraid of being punished?

Just as Matriarch Lu was about to speak, her gaze fell on the flowers in Lu Qi’s hand.

Why was Lu Qi holding Hyacinths?

She still remembered that the blessing bag Qiao Nian had embroidered on their Sugar had a hyacinth.

She had heard that hyacinths represented rebirth?

Matriarch Lu recalled Lu Zhu’s words just now. She looked at the firecrackers all over the ground and then at the hyacinth in Lu Qi’s hand.

Could something have happened?

Matriarch Lu asked, “Who are you preparing to give this bouquet to?”

When Lu Qi heard Matriarch Lu’s question, she looked excited. She gave a sweet smile and said happily, “Grandma, of course this bouquet is for my sister!”

Out of the corner of her eye, Song Yu subconsciously glanced at Qiao Nian. It seemed that Lu Qi also knew Qiao Nian’s true identity.
