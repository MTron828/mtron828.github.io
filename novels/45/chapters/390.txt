Chapter 391: Grandma Knows

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she had a strange feeling. Gu Zhou didn’t seem to be angry or disappointed, only cold.

It made her feel that Gu Zhou did not care about Jiang Yue at all.

When Jiang Yue heard Gu Zhou’s question, her voice trembled a little as she said, “I… I probably did it.”

“Is that so?”

At this moment, a cold wind blew in from outside. Jiang Yue’s goosebumps stood up in fear.

Jiang Yue couldn’t help but shiver. “Ah, it’s too late, Brother Ah Zhou. Why don’t we go back first…”

“Answer me!” Gu Zhou interrupted Jiang Yue expressionlessly.

Jiang Yue could tell that Gu Zhou was already getting impatient.

She pursed her lips and risked everything. “I did it!”

Gu Zhou’s phoenix eyes narrowed slightly. His voice was as cold as ice as he mercilessly announced Jiang Yue’s fate. “I’ve already given you a chance. In that case, from tomorrow onwards, I don’t want to see you in the Gu family villa!”

With that, Gu Zhou left with Qiao Nian.

Jiang Yue was the only one left.

After a while, Jiang Yue quickly reacted. She ran quickly to Gu Zhou and blocked his way with both hands. She looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief. “Brother Ah Zhou, are you chasing me away?”

Gu Zhou looked at Jiang Yue coldly, as if he was looking at a dead person.

Jiang Yue’s eyes instantly turned red. She panicked and hurriedly said, “Brother Ah Zhou, you can’t chase me away. I’m Grandma’s god granddaughter. Even if you want to chase me away, it should be Grandma who should do it!”

Gu Zhou sneered and asked, “Do you think you’re still qualified to see Grandma?”

Jiang Yue’s heart instantly rose to her throat. “What?”

Seeing Jiang Yue like this, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but laugh. “Do you think Grandma doesn’t know who was behind the poisoning last time?”

“You… you’re talking nonsense. What poison?”

“What kind of person is Grandma Jiang Yue? What hasn’t she seen before? Do you think you can avoid it by swearing on your late mother? You’re too naive! Let me tell you, Grandma already knew that you did those things. She just didn’t want to expose you!”

Qiao Nian’s words were like a sharp blade that stabbed into Jiang Yue’s heart, making it difficult for her to breathe.

At this moment, the butler, who had been standing at the side without saying a word, said, “Miss Jiang Yue, the tea leaves you bought previously belonged to the shop under Old Madam’s name. As the tea leaves you wanted were gone, I specially took them out in advance from other customers for you.”

Jiang Yue felt like the entire world had collapsed.

That tea shop actually belonged to Grandma!

So no matter what she did, Grandma knew!

Jiang Yue’s body involuntarily softened, and her face turned pale.

Qiao Nian looked up slightly and continued to provoke her. “Why else do you think Grandma called us to go back?”

Jiang Yue looked at Qiao Nian anxiously. She had a bad feeling.

Qiao Nian paused for a moment before continuing, “Actually, Grandma still cares about you a lot. If she didn’t care about you, she could have called Gu Zhou directly. However, she just wanted to stop you from making a mistake. It’s just that you’ve let her down.”

Jiang Yue could no longer hold on. Her legs went limp and she fell to the ground.

That’s true!

He had never cared about her before.

If her grandmother hadn’t wanted to stop her from making a mistake, she wouldn’t have called her home.

Qiao Nian looked down at Jiang Yue and said coldly, “The last time, you tampered with the medicine I gave Grandma and almost killed her. However, at that time, you didn’t know how to repent. This time, you used Qin Lu and almost ruined both my and Li Kun’s innocence.”Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m
