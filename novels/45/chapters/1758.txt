Chapter 1759 - 1759 Condition

The president knew in his heart that Mark had set this up to let Lina die.

At this moment, the secretary walked in anxiously. When he saw Mark, he bent down and whispered into the President’s ear.

The other members of the royal family already knew that the Seventh Princess had been locked up by Mark. All of them were curious about what had happened. Mark sat opposite the President. His gaze was always on the President’s face, noting the change in the President’s expression. It seemed that the President already knew the current situation.

Seeing that the secretary had already stood up straight, Mark said, “I really don’t know how you, the president of a country, brought up your daughter. Now that your daughter has already committed a huge crime of murder, I think you should personally put your daughter in jail and watch the execution yourself.”

The president’s eyes were turbulent. He looked at the secretary in front of him coldly and said word by word, “You, don’t even think about it!”

He wasn’t cold and heartless like Mark. How could he not care about his daughter?

Seeing that the President was about to lose his mind, Qiao Nian frowned and said calmly, “You came here today to negotiate, right? Otherwise, you would have brought the Seventh Princess to the royal meeting long ago.”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, the president gradually came back to his senses. He took a deep breath and said coldly, “What conditions do you have?”

Mark did not answer the President immediately. Instead, he looked at Qiao Nian. In such a dangerous situation, Qiao Nian could still think clearly about the ins and outs of the matter and directly raise the essence of the problem.

Mark wanted to see more of the president’s breakdown because of his daughter. Unfortunately, he didn’t have a chance now.

“It’s very simple,” Mark said calmly. “If we remove Lina’s association with the murder, make sure Lina and Wright get married in three days. Let Wright out now. The venue of the wedding is still at my manor.”

Mark had a cold smile on his face. His daughter had been crippled by the President, the gold rooms in the basement had been taken away by the President, and Wright had been locked up by the President.

During this period of time, things had been too rough for him. He had to let the president have a taste of pain.

His original plan would take many years, but he couldn’t wait now. He had to bring it forward.

The President gritted his teeth, his blue eyes filled with hatred. There was no way he could refuse Mark’s conditions.

He really didn’t want Lina to marry an animal like Wright. His daughter deserved a better life.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Regarding the wedding… Lina is a princess. How can she prepare for a wedding in three days?” The president said through gritted teeth.

Mark’s tone was cold as he said directly, “Dear brother, you don’t have to worry about the rest. I’ve already prepared the invitations.”

Mark and the president stared at each other. They both knew very well that this wedding was definitely not simple.

After Mark finished speaking, he stood up and left, not giving the president a chance to negotiate at all. When he reached the door, he seemed to have thought of something and said with a smile, “I heard that there’s a doctor in your residence who knows Chinese Medicine. Wright is quite injured. I hope that Wright can appear at the wedding unscathed in three days. I don’t want to embarrass Europe!”

Mark’s gaze paused on Qiao Nian’s face.

Qiao Nian looked at Mark expressionlessly.

After Mark and the others left, the oppressive atmosphere in the living room disappeared. Lina was also taken away by Mark.

The President took a deep breath and gestured for Gu Zhou and the others to sit down. He said coldly, “We’re right. Mark is here for Wright this time.”

“Wright should be one of his pawns. He just needs this pawn.” Gu Zhou straightened his back and said in a cold voice, “Although it’s a little different from our previous plan, what Mark is going to do next is what we calculated in our plan. Let’s prepare for the wedding now.”

The rest was for Big Brother and the others to do.

Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. “President, you did very well just now. I think Mark’s mind is filled with determination. He won’t suspect that we have other cheap tricks.”
