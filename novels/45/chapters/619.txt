Chapter 620: Nian’er

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Initially, Gu Zhou had suspected that Gu Qi might have made these things up. However, when he thought about how he had indeed seen a psychiatrist walk out of Gu Qi’s room when he was sober, he realized that this meant that Gu Qi had a deep memory of the past. It had already been explained that these things had really happened.

None of Gu Qi’s words were lies.

But he really didn’t have these memories.

Could it be that someone was deliberately sowing discord?

Just like the nanny from before. In order to climb up to the position of Young Madam of the Gu family, she had said many unpleasant words to Gu Qi.

Could it be that someone had used his name to get Gu Qi a psychiatrist? Was that why Gu Qi had misunderstood him?

Who exactly had told Gu Qi that he liked girls?

“Little Qi, listen to Daddy. Those people are lying to you. Daddy likes you the most, understand?” Gu Zhou looked at Little Qi gently and said.

He thought that Gu Qi would definitely not be angry anymore.

However, just as he finished speaking, Gu Qi became even angrier. He said unhappily, “Even now, you still refuse to admit what you said before.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Gu Zhou was slightly stunned.

The more Gu Qi thought about it, the more aggrieved he felt. He questioned loudly, “On my third birthday, you told me yourself that you wanted a daughter. You would even name her Nian’er. In the future, you have to dote on her and take care of her for the rest of her life. If you take care of her, what about me?”

Gu Zhou was stunned. He looked at Gu Qi in disbelief.

There was no way he would say something so outrageous!

Who exactly was framing him?

She was trying to sow discord between him and Gu Qi.

Nian’er…

Gu Zhou suddenly recalled that when he was in MY, he vaguely remembered this name.

This name was like sweet candy to him, but also like a beautiful and addictive poppy. It lingered in his mind, as if it wanted to remind him of something.

Looking at Gu Qi’s sad expression, Gu Zhou couldn’t help but suspect that someone might look exactly like him and said something very unpleasant in front of Gu Qi.

He had to investigate this matter thoroughly.

At this moment, Gu Zhou suddenly heard Gu Qi say, “Actually, this is quite good. After you get together with Auntie, the two of you will have another Sister Nian’er!”

Gu Zhou’s expression darkened slightly. Who was spouting nonsense in front of Little Qi?

Logically speaking, the servants of the Gu family should not have made such a low-level mistake.

Of course, it was even more impossible for Qiao Nian.

Could it be Jiang Yue, who had sneaked into the Gu residence?

Gu Zhou’s frown deepened. It seemed that Jiang Yue was still unrepentant. He would never let Jiang Yue get close to Gu Qi again.

Just as Gu Zhou was about to speak, his phone suddenly rang.

He opened it and saw that it was a message from Chen Qing.

“Second Young Master, I’ve already investigated the person called Gu Chuan!”

Gu Zhou closed his phone, too lazy to reply to Chen Qing.

Although he was not a qualified father, Gu Qi was very important to him.

If he hadn’t fallen ill back then, he would have taken Gu Qi over and raised him well.

Gu Zhou looked at the teary-eyed Gu Qi. He understood very well what Gu Qi was feeling now. Gu Qi was just like when he was young.

He was the same kind of person as Gu Qi.

He no longer wanted Gu Qi to follow his previous path. He wanted Gu Qi to live a good life like an ordinary child. He would do his best to create better conditions for Gu Qi.

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on Gu Qi’s face and he said softly, “Little Qi, I’m your father. No matter what it is, you can tell me everything in detail.”

At this point, Gu Zhou continued, “Who told you that I’m with Auntie?”

Gu Qi looked up at Gu Zhou, the sorrow in his eyes obvious. He said with a serious expression, “Dad, you don’t need anyone to tell me this. I just saw you carry her back to your room with my own eyes!”

What?

Gu Zhou’s mind went blank.

He couldn’t believe what he was hearing.

He was originally in the study, but for some reason, he appeared in the room.
