864 Doing a Test

In less than five minutes, a doctor hurriedly walked over. He walked up to Gu Zhou and took off his mask.

Song Man glanced at the name on the doctor’s name tag. Xu Cheng, the director of the appraisal department.

She pursed her lips. She had a bad feeling about this.

Song Man had initially thought that she just had to shatter the sample Qiao Nian had contained her blood sample. However, when she thought about it, if she really did that, it would arouse even more suspicion from Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian.

!!

Song Man’s frown deepened. She lowered her head and said nothing.

Xu Cheng looked at Gu Zhou respectfully and asked, “Mr. Gu, did you bring your DNA sample?”

When Qiao Nian heard Xu Cheng’s words, she hurriedly handed Song Man’s blood sample to him.

Gu Zhou said, “Take this sample and do a DNA test with Gu Qi and the blood sample. Do it now. Tell me when the results are out.”

Xu Cheng nodded respectfully. After answering, he took the sample and left.

Chen Qing had already completed the hospitalization procedures. Just as he came over and was about to speak to Gu Zhou, he heard Gu Zhou’s instructions.

“If you accompany Director Xu for the DNA test now, I’ll know the results immediately!” Gu Zhou said with a serious expression. Although he trusted Director Xu very much, he was afraid that there would be other mistakes.

He would never allow anything to go wrong when it came to confirming the child’s mother.

This paternity test was very important to Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou trusted Chen Qing the most. If he asked Chen Qing to accompany Director Xu for a DNA test, he would be very relieved.

Chen Qing knew the seriousness of this matter and nodded. “Yes.”

Then, Chen Qing left with Xu Cheng.

Gu Zhou waited anxiously outside. He glanced at the time. Only twenty minutes had passed, but it felt like a century to him.

This was the first time he had realized that time passed so slowly.

If Qiao Nian hadn’t been by his side, he didn’t know how long he would have had to wait.

Qiao Nian was sensitive enough to sense the change in Gu Zhou’s mind. Sometimes, quiet company was the best comfort for him.

Twenty minutes later.

The emergency room door finally opened.

Holding Qiao Nian’s hand, Gu Zhou walked to the doctor’s side and asked anxiously, “Doctor, how is Xiao Shi now?”

The doctor looked at Gu Zhou solemnly and took off his mask. He sighed and said, “She took a lot of sleeping pills. Fortunately, it was found out in time and she survived! Otherwise…”

When Gu Zhou heard the doctor’s words, he frowned. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“A lot?” Qiao Nian instantly grasped the main point of the doctor’s words.

The doctor nodded and said very heavily, “From the contents of her stomach, she must have taken half a bottle of sleeping pills!”

Qiao Nian’s face turned pale.

Gu Zhou narrowed his eyes, which were filled with coldness. His entire body emitted a cold aura. He looked at Song Man deeply.

Song Man was shocked by Gu Zhou’s gaze. For a moment, she felt that Gu Zhou’s gaze seemed to want to kill her.

Qiao Nian frowned. What she was concerned about now was why Xiao Shi had taken sleeping pills. Had she taken them herself, or had Song Man fed them to her?

If she had been fed the pills by Song Man, it meant that Song Man wanted to murder Xiao Shi.

Should she call the police directly?

Qiao Nian looked at Song Man coldly, her beautiful fox-like eyes narrowing slightly. Her gaze fell on the doctor and she asked, “Doctor, are there any other marks on Xiao Shi’s throat or chin?”

The doctor was also used to the world. When he heard Qiao Nian’s question, he instantly understood.

Based on this, it was possible to determine if the patient had taken the sleeping pills herself or if someone had forced them on her.

The doctor shook his head seriously.

“There are no other marks on the patient’s chin. Moreover, I’ve also examined the patient’s throat. Her throat is normal. It’s not swollen or congested. Moreover, other than sleeping pills, there’s only water in her stomach. Preliminary judgment is that she took them herself.”

Qiao Nian’s expression changed drastically. Her throat felt as if it was being strangled by an invisible hand. She asked dryly, “Are… are you sure?”
