723 Recognition?

Back in MY, Sugar and Third Brother had been very close.

Could it be that Sugar couldn’t help but want to acknowledge her third brother?

However, he had yet to find any clues about what had happened back then. If Sugar acknowledged her third brother now, everyone present would know that Qiao Nian was the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

Would Sugar be in danger again?

Although he believed that all the servants of the Lu family were reliable and safe, he could not completely trust them.

At this moment, Lu Nian was thinking the same thing as Lu Zhu.

They were worried that Sugar would acknowledge her third brother now and be in danger in the future.

Secondly, Lu Nian was a little worried about his leg.

If Grandma knew that Qiao Nian was Sugar and that he and Big Brother hadn’t told Grandma about this, Grandma would definitely break his legs with a stick.

Such a beautiful leg was about to break so quickly.

Lu Rao’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. Seeing that Qiao Nian was silent, he said gently, “Miss Qiao, what can I do for you?”

Only then did Qiao Nian come back to her senses. She glanced at the urn, then at Lu Rao. She opened her mouth slightly and said, “You’ll hurt your hand!”

When Lu Zhu heard Qiao Nian’s words, his heart, which had been in his throat, slowly settled back down.

Sugar was really smart and rational.

If she was an insensible young lady, he might have lost his legs.

Lu Nian heaved a sigh of relief. Fortunately, his Sugar had already changed the topic.

Lu Zhu and Lu Nian realized that Sugar was feeling sorry for Third Brother. All of them felt a little jealous. They also wanted Sugar to care about them.

After Qiao Nian finished speaking, she wanted to slap herself. What nonsense was she talking about?

She was just a guest in the Lu family. She shouldn’t have stopped him.

In the end, she stepped forward because she was worried about Lu Rao.

Lu Rao glanced at the urn and said sadly, “I wonder if she knows the way home after we moved!”

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Rao’s words, she knew that Lu Rui was deliberately changing the topic to give her an out.

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze slightly.

Although the ashes in this urn did not belong to her, it might belong to another girl. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

This urn had been here for more than twenty years. If that girl had never reincarnated, her soul might have always lived here.

Children’s memories were always unstable. They preferred what they were familiar with.

Qiao Nian thought for a while and said, “I wonder if there’s a carving knife?”

When everyone heard Qiao Nian’s words, their expressions froze.

Matriarch Lu was the first to ask, “Qiao Nian, why are you asking for a carving knife?”

“I’ve studied carving before. I want to help Eldest Miss Lu repair the urn,” Qiao Nian said.

When Matriarch Lu heard Qiao Nian’s words, her frown deepened, but she didn’t respond immediately.

Her eldest granddaughter was in the urn. She did not want her eldest granddaughter’s peace and quiet to be disturbed.

Qiao Nian naturally understood Matriarch Lu’s worry. A faint smile appeared on her face as she said sincerely, “Matriarch Lu, I’m more or less responsible for what happened today. If Jiang Yue didn’t want to frame me, she wouldn’t have destroyed the urn of the eldest daughter of the Lu family. I want to do my best to make up for some of my mistakes.”

Qiao Nian glanced at the traces of corrosion on the urn. Her mind raced, and she quickly came up with a drawing.

“If the urn can be carved with exquisite patterns, I think the eldest daughter of the Lu family will definitely be happy,” Qiao Nian said calmly.

Matriarch Gu naturally knew that Qiao Nian had good intentions, but she was still a little hesitant.

At this moment, Lu Nian, who was standing at the side, said, “Grandma, let her try!”

When Lu Zhu heard Lu Nian’s words, he nodded in agreement. “I think she should be able to do it. Let her try!”

Song Yu frowned slightly. She hadn’t expected her eldest brother and second brother to speak up for Qiao Nian.

However, the most important thing now was not to think about Big Brother and Second Brother’s attitudes towards Qiao Nian, but to resolve the problem of the urn.

Song Yu said hesitantly, “Should I ask the master if she’ll violate any taboos?”
