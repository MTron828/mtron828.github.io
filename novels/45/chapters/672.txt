“I think so too, so I don’t intend to let Sugar announce her identity now. This is good too. It will protect her personal safety. We just have to know that he’s still alive!” Lu Zhu said. He looked at Qiao Nian gently, his lips curving up slightly. “Therefore, when I first returned, I didn’t tell you that Sugar was still alive. This was also to protect Sugar.”

Lu Nian looked up at Lu Zhu, who happened to look over as well.

When the two brothers looked at each other, they saw responsibility and coldness in each other’s eyes.

They only knew that they had a tacit understanding. Although they didn’t say anything, they were thinking the same thing.

In the past, they were too young and their abilities were limited. They couldn’t take good care of their sister.

But they were no longer children. They were also strong enough to protect their sister.

Their Sugar could never be hurt again.

The two of them gradually looked away.

Lu Nian’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face again. His voice was gentle, and his lips curved up slightly. “Sugar, come!”

As Lu Nian spoke, he reached out his hand to Qiao Nian, looking forward to her response.

Qiao Nian placed her hand on Lu Nian’s.

Just like more than twenty years ago, when she was two or three years old, she placed her hand on the young Lu Nian’s.

Holding Qiao Nian’s hand, Lu Nian smiled gently and pulled her towards the wooden door.

When the two of them arrived at the wooden door, Lu Nian looked at the marks on it and recalled how he had carved marks on the door with Sugar when he was young.

He had ruined a perfectly good door.

At that time, their parents were very angry and even reprimanded them.

Lu Nian’s other hand gently touched the marks. He turned to Qiao Nian and said, “The two of us were really naughty when we were young. We deliberately made these marks. At that time, we were even scolded by Mom and Dad!”

With a thought, the memories that had appeared in Qiao Nian’s mind became clearer and clearer. However, she still couldn’t see the exact situation clearly.

She still remembered that she had been wanting to open this door. She pursed her lips slightly, curious about what was behind the door.

Lu Nian reached out and opened the wooden door.

Suddenly, a pleasant scent of ambergris wafted out.

When Qiao Nian saw the scene inside, she was completely stunned.

This…

Everything here was exactly the same as the piano room in her dream.

There was an old piano, white tables and chairs not far away, and a white wool carpet on the ground.

Qiao Nian’s uneasy heart gradually calmed down.

She watched all of this intently, her eyes growing brighter.

Involuntarily, she walked up to the piano and gently stroked it.

The piano had appeared countless times in her dreams. It had been glamorous back then, but now it was old. However, this piano was still very clean, and her face could be seen on the reflection.

Her hand touched the shelf of the piano. Suddenly, an image flashed across her mind. She was standing on the piano, preparing to take a photo.

All of this gradually became real.

Qiao Nian’s eyes couldn’t help but turn red. In the past, she had been very envious of girls who had family members who doted on them. But now, she realized that she was the happiest person in the world, because her family had cared about her since she was young.

Although she didn’t live with her family, they still remembered her and thought about her.

Qiao Nian sat silently in front of the piano and slowly closed her eyes. In a daze, she seemed to see the young man sitting in front of the piano. She placed her hand on the keys and began to play.

A beautiful lightness could be vaguely heard from the piano. Qiao Nian was completely immersed in it.

Lu Nian stood at the side, his breathing involuntarily tightening. He looked at Qiao Nian gently.

This was…

This was the song Qiao Nian had just played.

Previously, Qiao Nian had also played this song in the piano room outside. However, the style of the song had changed a little.

He had never publicized this song. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

This was a song he had specially written for Sugar. The name of this song was “Light”.

Sugar was like a beam of light to him, illuminating the darkest part of his heart.
