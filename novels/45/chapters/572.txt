Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

As long as she obtained the contract, she would run off to look for her grandfather who mysteriously disappeared and senior brothers. After that happened, she would return to treat Gu Zhou’s illness. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

If Gu Zhou’s illness was not cured, he would very likely die.

Qiao Nian felt a little suffocated, and her heart ached.

If she told Gu Zhou now that she wanted a divorce, with Gu Zhou’s pride, he would definitely not let her help with the treatment again.

Even if she wanted a divorce, she had to treat his illness first. At the thought of this, Qiao Nian said, “How is that possible? Everyone wants to be Mrs. Gu!”

Gu Zhou didn’t feel relieved. Although Qiao Nian was smiling, he could tell that she was hesitating before answering his question.

She really wanted a divorce.

Was the Gu family that bad?

Did she want to leave this place so badly?

“Do you want to divorce me that badly?”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She looked at Gu Zhou in surprise. She had no intention of getting a divorce now.

Before Qiao Nian could speak, she saw Gu Zhou turn around and go downstairs.

“Where are you going?” Qiao Nian was worried that Gu Zhou’s condition was unstable. What if Gu Chuan ran out? She hurriedly followed him.

“I’m going out!”

When he reached the first floor, Gu Zhou stopped Chen Qing, who was about to leave, and left with him.

Qiao Nian watched as Gu Zhou left. She felt that Gu Zhou was a little strange, but with Chen Qing by his side, he should be fine.

Qiao Nian took out her phone and sent Chen Qing a message. “Pay more attention to him. Perhaps other personalities will appear.”

Chen Qing, who had walked into the courtyard, glanced at his phone and hurriedly replied. He put his phone back into his pocket and pretended that nothing had happened.

When Qiao Nian saw Chen Qing’s message, she heaved a sigh of relief and sat down on the sofa, looking exhausted.

After a long while, Qiao Nian regained her composure and walked upstairs.

In the evening, Qiao Nian was taking care of the sleeping Gu Qi. When she heard the knock on the door, she walked out.

When she came out of her room, she saw Chen Qing waiting for her outside.

“Second Young Madam, Second Young Master asked me to take you somewhere,” Chen Qing said in a low voice.

Qiao Nian hesitated for a moment. Then, she remembered that Gu Qi had just fallen asleep. He shouldn’t be waking up anytime soon. She nodded at Chen Qing and the two of them walked out.

“Was his emotions stable during the day?” Qiao Nian asked worriedly. “Did his other personalities come out?”

“No, Second Young Madam. Are you saying that Second Young Master might switch personalities soon?” Chen Qing frowned deeply, his lips pursed.

Qiao Nian thought of Gu Zhou’s current state and couldn’t help but sigh. She said, “It’s hard to say what his situation is like now. Try to stay by his side as much as possible. If anything happens, he’ll be safe with you around. By the way, where did he ask you to take me?”

“The villa on the mountain.”

When Qiao Nian heard Chen Qing’s answer, she was slightly stunned. When she first went there, Gu Zhou’s personality had already appeared.

Hence, she was a little curious why Gu Zhou wanted her to go to the villa on the mountain this time. “Why does he want me to go there?”

“Second Young Master won’t tell me,” Chen Qing said flatly.

Qiao Nian smiled and didn’t say anything else.

Chen Qing drove Qiao Nian up the mountain.

She opened the car window, and a strong osmanthus fragrance brushed past her nose. Her gaze fell on the stars in the sky, and she was slightly stunned.

So beautiful.

This feeling was really good.

However, Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat.

Today was not a special festival. Could Gu Zhou have done something wrong?

Gu Zhou usually treated her with indifference.

While Qiao Nian was thinking, the car had already arrived at the hut on the mountain.

After Chen Qing got out of the car, he quickly walked to the front passenger seat and opened the door.

Qiao Nian got out of the car and saw Gu Zhou standing not far away.
