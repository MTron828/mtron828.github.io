Chapter 1808 - 1808 Meeting

A trace of surprise flashed across Qiao Nian’s eyes. She smiled gently. “No, I was just thinking about what to say to Eldest Senior Brother later.”

When the two of them got out of the car, they noticed that there were many guards outside the president’s private airport surrounding the entire airport.

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian hurriedly walked in. The captain of the patrolling guards had seen Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian before and hurriedly welcomed them.

Gu Zhou briefly explained to the captain why they wanted to go in. The captain hurriedly invited them in.

When they arrived at the airport, Qiao Nian happened to see Chen Sheng and Chang Feng boarding the plane.

The corners of Qiao Nian’s mouth curled up involuntarily. She hurriedly shouted, “Eldest Senior Brother!”

They were too far away. The noise before the plane took off overpowered Qiao Nian’s voice.

Qiao Nian looked at the time on her wrist and looked at the plane in disappointment. She said in confusion, “Eldest Senior Brother clearly said that there’s still 10 minutes before the flight starts. Why are they early?”

The captain of the patrol team explained, “This flight is flying directly to An City.”

Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou exchanged glances.

Previously, both Gu Yue and Chang Feng had said that they wanted to go back to MY first, but now, they were taking a plane to An City.

This was the president’s private plane. The president had a total of three planes. The other planes had sent Cui Si’s people to MY.

Perhaps Qiao Nian’s intentions were already made known to Chang Feng. When Chang Feng walked into the plane, he subconsciously turned around.

Other than the patrolling security officers, the rest of the people at the private airport were waiting in line.

Chang Feng saw Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou at a glance.

Qiao Nian met Chang Feng’s gaze and waved at him.

Chang Feng waved at Qiao Nian, then leaned over to Chen Sheng’s ear and whispered a few words. Chen Sheng also turned around.

When Chen Sheng saw who it was, he could only see the people standing in the distance, but he could not see their expressions.

Chen Sheng pursed his thin lips, his expression complicated.

Qiao Nian lowered her eyes slightly and realized that the plane was only starting to move now. It would probably take a while for it to take off.

Qiao Nian looked at the guardrail in front of her, her eyes flickering.

The captain of the patrol team reminded them softly, “Mr. and Mrs. Gu, the plane is about to take off. It’s very dangerous for you to be here now. You should go back quickly!”

When Qiao Nian heard the captain of the patrol team say that, she couldn’t wait to ask, “May I ask if we can board the plane now?”

When the captain of the patrol team heard Qiao Nian’s question, he quickly shook his head and said, “I’m afraid that won’t do. For your safety, why don’t I get someone to arrange for the next plane to send you to An City?”

At this moment, a loud sound came from the side.

Qiao Nian turned her head and saw that a portion of the protective fence had been kicked down.

Only then did she notice that Gu Zhou had done it. Before she could react, she was already dragged away by Gu Zhou.

Seeing this, the captain of the patrol team hurriedly shouted, “It’s too dangerous inside. Come back quickly!”

He still wanted to chase after them, but he was blinded by the cold wind.

Seeing that the two of them were about to reach the plane, Qiao Nian smiled and looked at Gu Zhou beside her. She teased, “Haven’t you always been law-abiding? Why are you so willful this time?”

“What law have we broken?” Gu Zhou smiled at Qiao Nian, his messy fringe made his smile more charming.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou and couldn’t help but laugh.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

At this moment, Chang Feng had already gone to look for the captain, hoping that he could take off later. Before the captain could agree, Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou had already entered the plane.

Chang Feng said a few polite words to the captain and walked out of the control room.

Chen Sheng looked at Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian, who had run in. As the two of them had run too fast, their faces were red and they were panting heavily.
He invited them to sit down, then poured a glass of water for Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian.

Chen Sheng looked at Qiao Nian, who was sitting diagonally opposite him. The tip of her nose was red, and her red lips were slightly parted as she exhaled. Her eyes were sparkling, giving people the feeling that she was a gem that had just been taken out of the water. She was crystal clear and beautiful, making people unable to take their eyes off her.
