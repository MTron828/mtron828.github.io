990 Possessed

Qiao Nian recalled what had happened last night and blushed. At that time, Gu Zhou was pure and lustful.

Especially since he kept calling her his wife by her ear and insisted that she call him husband.

This man was truly shameless.

She was so shy that she wanted to find a hole to hide in.

Anyway, she couldn’t say it.

Although she could no longer stand Gu Zhou’s torment, she still did not scream.

Qiao Nian suddenly had a strange feeling.

Could it be that Gu Zhou wanted her to call him Hubby in public?

This was really…

Qiao Nian was best at changing the topic, so she said, “I…”

“By the way, why is there an unfamiliar suit jacket in your room?” Gu Zhou had long guessed that Qiao Nian would change the topic.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion. That suit jacket had been hanging in the room for a few days. Previously, when Gu Zhou had seen it, he hadn’t asked her whose suit jacket it was. Why was he suddenly asking her about it?

Before Qiao Nian could figure out what was going on with Gu Zhou, Lu Jiang said unhappily, “It’s mine!”

Hearing Lu Jiang’s voice, Gu Zhou realized that Lu Jiang had also arrived.

When he came downstairs, all his attention was on Qiao Nian, and he didn’t notice anyone else at all.

“Ah Jiang and Ah Qi!” Gu Zhou greeted indifferently, his gaze falling on Qiao Nian’s face again.

Lu Jiang realized that Gu Zhou was looking at Qiao Nian. He frowned slightly and asked, “Give me my suit jacket.”

Gu Zhou invited Lu Jiang and Lu Qi to sit on the sofa and asked the servant to pour them tea. Only then did he say lightly, “I’ve thrown it away!”

“Why did you throw it away?” Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion. She didn’t understand what Gu Zhou was thinking at all.

Lu Jiang’s expression changed slightly. His sister had worn that suit jacket before.

Gu Zhou had gone too far. Without his sister’s permission, he had thrown the suit away.

Or could it be that Gu Zhou didn’t take his sister seriously at all, so he dealt with her things?

“That’s mine,” Lu Jiang said word by word, his eyes filled with dissatisfaction. He calmly took off his jacket and reached out to unbutton his shirt.

A trace of panic flashed across Lu Qi’s face. Was Fourth Brother angry? Was he going to fight Brother Ah Zhou?

Qiao Nian looked at Lu Jiang worriedly. Fourth Brother was angry because doted on her too much. But this was a misunderstanding.

Just as Qiao Nian was thinking about how to smooth things over, she heard Gu Zhou say, “I didn’t know that was yours!”

Even if he knew, he would throw it away.

Of course, Gu Zhou did not say this. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

In Gu Zhou’s opinion, no man could get close to Qiao Nian, even if that man was Qiao Nian’s biological brother.

Lu Jiang was not the kind of person to pester people endlessly. He understood what Gu Zhou meant. This also meant that Gu Zhou still cared a lot about his sister.

Lu Jiang felt that it was fine as long as his sister was happy.

However, he felt that Gu Zhou had not done well enough.

“When do you plan to hold your wedding with my sister?” Lu Jiang looked at Gu Zhou coldly, his expression darkening.

Hearing Lu Jiang’s words, Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. His gaze instantly turned gentle. “As long as my wife is willing, we can hold a wedding anytime!”

Hearing Gu Zhou’s words, Lu Jiang’s displeasure dissipated a little.

Lu Qi, who was sitting beside Lu Jiang, nodded. A good man should be like this. No matter what, his wife was his priority.

Lu Qi smiled at Qiao Nian and asked, “Sister, when do you plan to hold the wedding?”

“There’s no hurry about the wedding. I’m…”

“Indeed, there’s no hurry. But Gu Zhou, I want to ask, is this how you treat our eldest daughter of the Lu family?” Before Qiao Nian could finish speaking, Lu Jiang interrupted her. “You want her to marry into the Gu family and be the mother of your two children?”

Lu Jiang had just wanted to seek justice for Qiao Nian, but he had forgotten that Gu Zhou had two children.
