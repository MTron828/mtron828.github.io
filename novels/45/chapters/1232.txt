“I think it’s better,” Chang Feng said.

When Mr. Chen heard Chang Feng’s words, he lowered his gaze slightly and said dejectedly, “That’s good.”

Xiao Bao was still actively practicing shooting, but his best result was still six rings. Compared to before, he had not improved.

About half an hour later, Xiao Bao stopped practicing and took out the clip. Then, he clipped the gun to his waist and ran to Mr. Chen with a smile. He looked up and said, “Daddy, did I shoot well?”

Mr. Chen patted Xiao Bao’s shoulder and praised, “Yes, Xiao Bao did very well. He’s better than Daddy.”

Xiao Bao’s grape-like eyes were filled with light. He asked excitedly, “Daddy, can you give Xiao Bao a reward?”

“Yes, what reward do you want?”

“I want to go out and play.” Xiao Bao had always lived in the villa. Every day, a tutor would specially come over to teach him. All his activities were in the villa, and he had never gone out much.

Mr. Chen looked into Xiao Bao’s expectant eyes and couldn’t reject him heartlessly. “Okay!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Daddy, are you going out with me?” Xiao Bao held Mr. Chen’s hand and asked impatiently.

“Xiao Bao.” Mr. Chen sighed helplessly and squatted down, his gaze level with Xiao Bao. “Do you still remember what Daddy once said?”

Xiao Bao pursed his lips.

His father had said in the past that he couldn’t go out with him, because if the two of them went out and others saw them, it would bring him a lot of danger.

Xiao Bao lowered his gaze in disappointment and muttered, “Can’t I even go out for a while?”

“Xiao Bao, your safety is the most important. Daddy doesn’t want you to be hurt in any way,” Mr. Chen said softly, stroking Xiao Bao’s head.

Xiao Bao nodded and said sadly, “Daddy, I understand. Actually, I just want to see Daddy’s military base. I want to try a real gun. A toy gun isn’t a real gun.”

Mr. Chen hesitated for a long time, but still shook his head and rejected Xiao Bao’s request.

Xiao Bao felt even worse. He glanced at the villa. It was very big, but he already explored every place in the past five years. This place was extremely familiar. “Daddy, am I going to grow up in the villa forever?”

“No.” Mr. Chen looked at Xiao Bao gently and said softly, “It won’t be long before you can go out to play freely. At that time, Daddy can take you out. When that happens, I can take you to your mommy.”

The surprise came so suddenly that Xiao Bao was stunned for a moment. After a while, he asked uncertainly, “Daddy, is what you said true?”

Could he really be with Mommy?

“Does Xiao Bao not believe Daddy?” Mr. Chen sighed slightly. “When has Daddy ever lied to you?”

Xiao Bao lowered his head slightly and thought about it seriously. Then, he nodded and said, “Often!”

Mr. Chen was speechless.

He was telling the truth this time…

He thought for a while and said, “Get the butler to take you to the base.”

The light in Xiao Bao’s eyes grew brighter and brighter. He gave a big smile and nodded vigorously. “Daddy, you’re the best!”

Xiao Bao was already very happy to be able to visit the base.

Five minutes later, Butler Zhao drove out of the villa with Xiao Bao.

Chang Feng watched as the car left and said with a smile, “Xiao Bao is still very easy to satisfy.”

“It’s been hard on him for so many years.” As Mr. Chen spoke, he turned around and walked in.

Xiao Bao sat obediently in the back driver’s seat and leaned against the window, looking out curiously at the scenery.

Although his father often went back on his word, he knew in his heart that when he grew up, he could go outside and live a free life. He would be like a bird soaring in the sky, or a fish swimming in the sea.

Xiao Bao’s calf swayed slightly.

There was a red light ahead, and the car gradually stopped. Xiao Bao saw the woman sitting in the car beside him.

His pupils instantly dilated. Covering his mouth with both hands, he looked at the woman in surprise.
