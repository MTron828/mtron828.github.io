That smile just now was not only a form of relief for her past, but also a form of anticipation for the future.

After going around in circles, it turned out that the person who had saved her was Gu Zhou.

Her benefactor was also Gu Zhou.

Since Qiao Yu had nothing to do with Brother White Shirt, she could deal with the Qiao family without restraint, and without any psychological burden.

She had already found the answer she wanted today.

She was a very cautious person.

If she had doubts, she would want to confirm them.

Now it confirmed her guess.

After discussing private matters today, they were about to discuss business. Qiao Nian put away the smile on her face and looked at Qiao Yu solemnly. She asked, “Qiao Yu, why did you ask me to come over today?”

Qiao Yu was slightly stunned. Qiao Nian looked at him as if she was looking at a stranger. His heart seemed to be clenched tightly by a hand, and it hurt terribly.

Qiao Yu swallowed. His voice was hoarse as he asked uneasily, “Aren’t you angry?”

“Why should I be angry? Moreover, to be precise, I should be thanking you. If you hadn’t given me the right answer, I might have spent more effort to find out the truth.” The smile on Qiao Nian’s face grew brighter.

Qiao Yu was slightly stunned. At this moment, he suddenly understood something.

The furthest distance in the world was not between life and death, but between hearts.

The most terrifying thing was that the other party was already indifferent, but he couldn’t forget her.

He felt that Qiao Nian was gradually leaving him. He couldn’t seem to get any closer to her.

Seeing that Qiao Yu had his head lowered in silence, Qiao Nian asked impatiently, “Didn’t you say previously that you had already written a proposal for me? Where is your proposal? I want to take a look!”

As Qiao Nian spoke, she glanced at the watch on her wrist and continued, “It’s getting late. I can only give you five minutes!”

Qiao Yu looked at Qiao Nian with a complicated expression. Only then did he hand the proposal to Qiao Nian. His voice was hoarse and unpleasant to the ear, like autumn leaves brushing against dry old bark. “Take a look!”

Qiao Nian didn’t notice the change in Qiao Yu’s expression. Since they were discussing business, she took the proposal and read it carefully.

Qiao Nian read the proposal very quickly. She made a simple calculation in her heart and finally looked at Qiao Yu in confusion.

Qiao Yu only wanted 5% of the profits.

To be honest, Qiao Nian was tempted.

She believed that no matter who it was, they would be tempted by this profit.

No one would go against money.

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze, hesitating.

She didn’t want to have any business contact with the Qiao family. Actually, she knew very well that if this plan was handed over to Qiao Yu, Qiao Yu would be connected to Nanshan Corporation.

Qiao Yu had made so many concessions to this plan not because he didn’t want the profits anymore, but because he wanted to get involved with Nanshan Corporation. That way Qiao Yu could earn more profits. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Qiao Nian placed the proposal on the table and looked at Qiao Yu calmly. A cold smile appeared on her face as she said, “I’m sorry, this proposal doesn’t meet my expectations, so I’m not satisfied. I’m afraid our Nanshan Corporation can’t work with President Qiao anymore!”

After Qiao Nian finished speaking, she added, “I don’t think I want to work with the Qiao family now or in the future. Let’s go our separate ways in the future!”

When Qiao Yu heard Qiao Nian’s words, he roughly understood what she meant. His heart sank and he asked, “Nian’er, are you still angry about what happened five years ago?”

At the mention of five years ago, Qiao Nian’s expression turned colder and colder.

Even if Qiao Yu wasn’t her savior, Qiao Yu had treated her very well when they were in the countryside. She had treated Qiao Yu as the closest person to her, but she had never expected Qiao Yu to betray her trust.

That night, she kept calling Qiao Yu, hoping that he could save her, but he didn’t pick up.

After this incident, Qiao Yu didn’t call to ask about her.

In the past, Qiao Yu had always told her that he would stand in front of her and protect her. He would never let her be hurt.
