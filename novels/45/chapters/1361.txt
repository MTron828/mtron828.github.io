1362 Snowing

Lu Qi stood rooted to the ground and looked at Qin Chuan seriously, her gaze lingering on his face and scarf.

There was only a step between the two of them. Under Lu Qi’s gaze, Qin Chuan pursed his thin lips slightly. He was so nervous that he forgot to even breathe.

“Senior is so handsome!” Lu Qi tilted her head slightly and smiled. When she smiled, her eyes curved up, and the corners of her mouth curved up. She was extremely adorable.

Qin Chuan’s Adam’s apple bobbed. He walked towards the passenger door and opened it, looking at Lu Qi with a smile. “Get in.”

“Thank you, Senior!” Lu Qi got into the front passenger seat with her bag. She lowered her head and fastened her seatbelt.

Seeing Lu Qi’s obedient expression, Qin Chuan couldn’t help but smile. However, he quickly regained his composure. “You’re my junior sister, and I’m your senior brother. There’s no need to be so polite between us.”

When Lu Qi heard Qin Chuan’s words, she smiled brightly.

Qin Chuan’s heart skipped a beat. He smiled and closed the passenger door, walking towards the driver’s seat.

In his mind, Lu Qi still looked adorable when she smiled, especially her small canine teeth. They were simply adorable.

He got into the driver’s seat and fastened his seatbelt. He looked up at the rearview mirror.

Hmm.

Lu Qi had good taste. The scarf she had chosen really suited him.

Qin Chuan’s lips curved up slightly. He turned the key, stepped on the accelerator, and drove out of the city.

About half an hour later, because the air conditioner was turned on in the car, Lu Qi pulled open the chain of her down jacket. She looked at the heavy snowfall in front of her. The sun in the sky had long disappeared. She smiled at Qin Chuan beside her. “Senior, I heard that everyone who sees snow during a sunny day is very lucky, so I’m especially lucky to be Mr. Qin’s disciple.”

Hearing her sweet voice, Qin Chuan looked carefully at the road ahead. When it snowed, he had to drive even more carefully. “You’ll always be so lucky.”

Lu Qi looked at Qin Chuan in confusion and asked in confusion, “Senior Brother, how do you know that I’ll always be lucky? Do you know how to read fortunes?”

“Yes, a person’s physiognomy can explain this a lot.” Qin Chuan knew a little about this.

“Senior, you’re amazing. You even know this. Then tell me, how lucky can I be in the future?” Lu Qi asked with interest. Although medical students could not be superstitious, she was still very curious.

Qin Chuan recalled the first time he had seen Lu Qi. With a smile in his eyes, he said softly, “You’ll meet someone who loves you very much. He’ll try his best to satisfy all your hopes. He’ll try his best to make you happy every day!”

When Lu Qi heard Qin Chuan’s words, she blinked in confusion and asked curiously, “Senior Brother, will I achieve anything in medicine?”

Qin Chuan was speechless. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Lu Qi pressed her palms together and said expectantly, “I hope that I can make outstanding contributions in the field of medicine that can benefit mankind. Will my wish be fulfilled?”

“You’ll be a big shot in the medical field in the future!” Qin Chuan said.

The smile on Lu Qi’s face grew wider and wider. Her eyes were filled with joy as she said happily, “Thank you for your kind words, Senior Brother. I’ll definitely work hard!”

Qin Chuan nodded. “Yes.”

Lu Qi looked at the snow outside the car window. There were fewer and fewer cars on the highway, and the surrounding fields were covered in a layer of white blanket. She looked at the situation outside and gradually calmed down.

When she was in the city, she felt that when it snowed, the snowflakes floating in the sky were beautiful. However, when she saw that everything around her was dyed white by the snow, her mind instantly went blank.

She looked at Qin Chuan and asked with interest, “Senior, are we going to the mountains?”

Previously, his sister had said that Old Master Qin had always lived in the village in the mountains to take care of himself.

When Qin Chuan heard Lu Qi’s words, he nodded and said, “Yes.”

“Then can I build a snowman?” Lu Qi asked expectantly, staring unblinkingly at Qin Chuan.

Qin Chuan sensed Lu Qi’s burning gaze. His grip on the steering wheel tightened slightly. “Yes.”

Lu Qi smiled happily and asked, “Senior Brother, do you like to build a snowman? Why don’t we build a snowman together?”
