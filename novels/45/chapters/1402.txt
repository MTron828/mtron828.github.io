1403 Fearless

Song Yu was wearing a large down jacket as she sat on a bench in the corridor. She pursed her lips tightly and held her phone tightly with both hands.

She had already fallen out with Song Xue. Would Song Xue tell others about her background?

Song Yu lowered her gaze weakly. Some things couldn’t be changed just because she wanted to. All she could do was obey the will of the heavens.

Song Yu tightened her down jacket and was about to sleep when footsteps came from not far away. She looked up and saw a woman standing at the end of the corridor.

That woman was none other than Song Xue whom she had blocked.

Song Yu silently retracted her gaze and lowered her head to play a cell phone game. Her footsteps were getting closer and closer.

The footsteps stopped in front of Song Yu. From the corner of her eye, Song Yu glanced at Song Xue and saw her sitting calmly on the stool beside her.

“You’re the big star Song Yu, right? Can you take a photo with me?”

When Song Yu heard Song Xue’s pretentious voice, she felt like throwing up. She looked at her cell phone without changing her expression and echoed, “I’m sorry, you’ve got the wrong person. I’m not her.”

“Are you really not?” Song Xue took out the dagger from her bag and pressed it against Song Yu’s waist, questioning sarcastically.

Song Yu sat up straight and narrowed her eyes slightly. She looked at Song Xue and said in a low voice, “You can choose to kill me here.”

Song Xue paused for a moment.

Song Yu moved slightly, and the tip of the knife sank into her clothes.

Song Xue’s hand, which was holding the knife, trembled slightly. She suddenly retracted her hand and grabbed Song Yu’s hand, walking straight to the safe passage. She pushed Song Yu against the wall and placed the knife across Song Yu’s neck.

Song Yu looked at Song Xue calmly and said, “Why don’t you slit my throat? You can leave after you cover up the event location. Anyway, I’m an abandoned chess piece now, right?”

Song Xue stared unblinkingly at Song Yu, as if she wanted to tell if Song Yu was telling the truth. She retracted her knife with an indifferent expression and said with a smile, “You’re right. Back then, you were chosen by the Lu family to enter the Lu family. Even if you find your family, their feelings for you will still remain the same.”

Hearing Song Xue’s words, Song Yu became even more nervous. She didn’t show it on her face and looked elsewhere indifferently.

“However, if they knew about what happened between you and Lu Nian, do you think they would still accept you?” Song Xue smiled, her eyes staring at her prey like a cunning fox.

Song Yu’s heart began to race uncontrollably, but she pretended to be calm. She glanced at Song Xue coldly and said calmly, “If you want to say it, go ahead.”

“Aren’t you afraid…”

“What am I afraid of?” Song Yu interrupted Song Xue mercilessly. She took a step forward and narrowed her eyes. “You can say whatever you want. I don’t care about anything. If you dare to attack my family again, don’t blame me for being impolite!”

With that, Song Yu pushed Song Xue away coldly and walked towards the corridor.

Song Xue was the only one left in the safe passage. Her eyes were filled with shock. She had thought that she had Song Yu under her control long ago, but Song Yu’s reaction was completely unexpected.

Could it be that Song Yu was really not afraid?

Song Xue frowned, her eyes turning cold.

Since this trick didn’t work, don’t blame her for being impolite.

The next morning, when Uncle Zhao woke up, he was locked in his original room with two bodyguards guarding the door.

The moment Qiao Nian walked into the room, she met Uncle Zhao’s empty eyes. Uncle Zhao was sitting by the bed in a daze, thinking about something. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Auntie Cao had been guarding Uncle Zhao for the entire night. When she saw Qiao Nian enter, she asked anxiously, “Eldest Miss, what’s wrong with Old Zhao? He didn’t say anything after he woke up. He just sat there.”

Qiao Nian walked up to Uncle Zhao and shook her hand in front of him. However, Uncle Zhao didn’t seem to feel anything.

“Is he like this when he wakes up?” Qiao Nian asked, looking at Auntie Cao.

Auntie Cao nodded anxiously, her eyes filled with confusion. “I don’t know what’s wrong with him either. Eldest Miss, has he lost his soul?”

Qiao Nian took Uncle Zhao’s pulse, but he still didn’t react to the outside world.

After doing all of this, Qiao Nian said, “We have to give him a full examination.”
