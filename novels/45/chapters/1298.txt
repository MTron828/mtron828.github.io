1299 Sleepless Night

A trace of surprise flashed in Cui Huai’s eyes. Could it be that he had really guessed wrong?

Chen Quan really wanted to kill Gu Zhou.

There were many opportunities to test Chen Quan, but it was too risky to let Chen Quan assassinate Gu Zhou now. He could not take the risk with the interests of HH Corporation.

Cui Huai heaved a sigh of relief and continued, “Don’t go. Let the others go. I have to make Gu Zhou die today. I won’t give him a chance to live!”

Mr. Chen knew that Cui Huai would definitely attack Gu Zhou again. He turned to look at Chang Feng beside him and said without hesitation, “I’ll send someone over to help!”

“Who?”

“Dao Wen, Ba Song and Chang Feng.”

When Cui Huai heard Mr. Chen mention the three names, his lips curved up slightly. After hanging up, he happily began to make arrangements. Tonight was destined to be a sleepless night.

At the hospital.

Interpol was guarding the wards of Kan Shan and Gu Zhou. Gu Zhou had already completed the surgery. The surgery was very successful and there were no aftereffects.

After the surgery, Qiao Nian rested on a small bed beside Gu Zhou’s ward.

The doctors and nurses passing by the door looked curiously at the door of the ward guarded by Interpol.

Doctor Wen Song, who had wanted to be the chief surgeon for Gu Zhou, returned to his room to freshen up and bought a bouquet of roses.

He was still in his thirties this year. Although he had a little less hair, he was still quite good looking.

Tomorrow was his girlfriend’s birthday. He was preparing to give her a surprise. Holding the roses, he walked to the underground parking lot and was about to get into the car when a man in a mask suddenly came out from the side.

“Ah!” Doctor Wen Song was so frightened that the roses in his hand fell to the ground. He raised his hands high, his legs trembling. He hurriedly said, “I’ll give you money. I’ll give you a car. Don’t kill me!”

“Work pass!” The masked man’s voice was hoarse.

Doctor Wen Song looked at the masked man in confusion, his eyes filled with confusion. “I have money. I’ll give you money!”

As he spoke, he was about to take out his money.

“Work pass!” The masked man said impatiently, his expression cold.

“It’s in my left pocket,” Doctor Wen Song said shakily, pointing to his left pocket.

“Don’t move!” As the masked man spoke, he took out the work pass from Doctor Wen Song’s pocket. He glanced at the photo on the work pass, then at Doctor Wen Song. With a cold expression, he said, “Turn around!”

“Yes.” Doctor Wen Song turned his back in fear, his heart in a mess.

Doctor Wen Song was feeling worried. The back of his neck hurt, and he didn’t know anything after that.

The masked man picked Doctor Wen Song up from the ground, tied him up, and threw him into the car, not forgetting to leave a gap in the car window.

Mercenaries like them cared about doctors the most. A good surgeon might be able to salvage them from the Grim Reaper.

The masked man tidied up. When he got out of the car, he was wearing a hat, a mask, and a white coat. He looked like a doctor. He hung his work pass in front of his chest.

The masked man was none other than Cui Yong, who had been sent by Cui Huai to kill Gu Zhou. Cui Yong was good at disguising himself. When he found out that Gu Zhou had been sent to the hospital, he had already rushed over to assassinate him. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Cui Yong swaggered to Doctor Wen Song’s office and pretended to tidy up.

When the young nurse passing by the door saw that Doctor Wen Song was still in the office, she smiled and asked, “Doctor Wen Song, didn’t you say that you wanted to go back early to rest?”

Cui Yong recalled Doctor Wen Song’s voice and disguised it as his. “I’m a little worried about my patient.”

The young nurse smiled at Doctor Wen Song and said, “Doctor Wen Song, you’re really the most responsible doctor in our hospital. We’ll go for a ward round first.”

Cui Yong nodded. After the two young nurses left, he replaced his hat with the one doctors often wore. Then, he replaced Doctor Wen Song’s photo with his own.

After he was done, Cui Yong walked towards the ward with the notebook. He first checked on his previous patients. After that, he prepared to enter Gu Zhou’s ward.

Cui Yong was still pushing the medical cart. Just as he reached the door of the ward, he was stopped by two Interpol officers.
