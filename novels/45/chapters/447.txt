Her first reaction was that she felt it was very likely that Song Yue or Gao Hong had done this.

However, she did not think so.

Most of the Song family’s resources were in the country, and Song Yue was definitely alone and helpless here.

However, it didn’t seem like Gao Hong had done it. If Gao Quan had deliberately come to find trouble, he would have sent someone over to settle the score with her when his leg was injured, not now.

At the scene, Gao Hong had said that as long as she was willing to kneel down and apologize to Gao Quan, this matter would be over.

Therefore, if Gao Quan were to look for her, it would definitely be for his face, not for the Moon Goddess.

Qiao Nian’s body trembled involuntarily. With a look of panic, she said, “No, don’t kill me. I’ll tell you. I’ll tell you everything!”

Seeing that Qiao Nian was so tactful, the man quietened down!

Qiao Nian took a deep breath. Her eyes were red, as if she had really been frightened. She quickly said, “I-After I got the Moon Goddess, I gave it to my assistant. I wanted him to go to the airport to check it in and send it back to An City quickly!”

Qiao Nian’s voice trembled slightly, as if she was very afraid.

“An City?”

The leader frowned, looking displeased.

If the Moon Goddess really arrived in An City, then this matter would be troublesome.

......

Qiao Nian said carefully, “Because my hometown is in An City, so I…”

The leader was furious. He cursed, “F*ck!” and was about to shoot Qiao Nian to death.

Qiao Nian hurriedly said, “But the assistant just left half an hour ago. I don’t think he’s at the airport yet. If we go now, we should be able to make it…”

Qiao Nian’s voice grew softer and softer, as if she was really afraid that the Chief would beat her to death.

When the man heard Qiao Nian’s words, a trace of hope flashed across his eyes. He asked, “What’s your assistant’s name?”

“Chen Qing.”

Qiao Nian thought, “Sorry, I’m going to borrow your name.”

When the man heard Qiao Nian’s words, he frowned slightly. He seemed to have heard this name before, but he couldn’t remember it clearly.

Qiao Nian nodded eagerly and said, “He’s my assistant!”

The man quickly said to his other two subordinates, “Hurry up and chase after him!”

The two subordinates responded and walked towards the door. Before they could open it, their leader stopped them.

“Come back. This matter still can’t be made public. We have to resolve this quietly!” At this point, the leader’s eyes darted around, finally landing on Qiao Nian’s face. “Call your assistant now and ask him to bring the Moon Goddess back!”

As he spoke, the leader gestured for his subordinate to pass her the phone that Qiao Nian had placed on the bedside table.

Qiao Nian had a bad feeling.

If she called Chen Qing now, wouldn’t everything be exposed?

As the leader spoke, he opened the safety catch on his gun. As long as he pulled the trigger, Qiao Nian’s head would explode.

“I’m telling you, don’t play games with me. If you lie, I’ll kill you right now!”

Hearing this, it seemed that she had no choice but to make this call.

Chen Qing was Gu Zhou’s bodyguard and secretary. Qiao Nian thought that he should be quite capable.

As she comforted herself, Qiao Nian called Chen Qing.

Chen Qing’s puzzled voice came from the phone. “Madam.”

Chen Qing was very surprised. He hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to call him at this time.

At this moment, the four kidnappers were staring fiercely at Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian pretended to be shocked and hurriedly said, “You haven’t reached the airport yet, right?”

“Of course not. I was with—”

Without hesitation, Qiao Nian interrupted Chen Qing and quickly said, “Chen Qing, I’ve thought it through. I think it’s better if I hand the Moon Goddess over to Old Madam personally. She’ll be happier. Hurry up and bring it back! Don’t let anyone know about this. I want to give Old Madam a surprise!”
