1183 Sad

Auntie Cao had been standing beside Su Yan. She stared blankly at the tombstone, her pupils a little unfocused.

Thank you readers!

Lu Qi walked to Su Yan’s side and comforted her softly. “Mom, Grandpa Shen is finally free.”

Auntie Cao walked to Su Yan’s side and comforted her softly. “Madam, being sad is harmful to your health. The Young Masters and Young Misses will also be worried about you.”

Su Yan took out a tissue to wipe her tears. She glanced at the children standing beside her, then glanced at her watch and said, “Alright, let’s go back!”

Before Su Yan left, she couldn’t help but take a few more glances at the tombstone.

That woman was too heartless!

If her daughter hadn’t been alive and if her daughter hadn’t returned, her teacher might have been killed by that woman. She would never know in her life that her teacher had suffered too.

It was all that woman’s fault. Not only had that woman ruined her family, but she had also ruined her teacher’s family!

Su Yan walked out.

Everyone from the Lu family got into the car one after another. Auntie Cao was the last to leave. She looked meaningfully at Shen An’s tombstone and pursed her red lips.

In the car.

Auntie Cao sat on Song Yu’s right, and Lu Nian sat on her left. When Auntie Cao was about to get into the car, Song Yu subconsciously moved closer to Lu Nian.

Lu Nian noticed Song Yu’s cheap shot. He frowned and moved to the left, as if he was unwilling to have any contact with Song Yu.

Song Yu had been in the entertainment industry for so long. She was the best at reading someone’s body language.

She noticed Lu Nian’s movements. Her eyes instantly darkened, and she lowered her head sadly.

Auntie Cao looked at Song Yu and held her hand with heartache. She seemed to have thought of something and leaned forward slightly to look at Lu Nian, who was sitting on the left. “Second Young Master, I heard that the Hundred Flowers Award Ceremony will be held soon. You’re the organizer, right?”

Everyone in the Lu family knew that Lu Nian was the famous musician, Mr. Dong Hua. Moreover, Lu Nian also ran a film and television company. He already had the ability to do whatever he wanted in the entertainment industry.

Chentian Film and Television Corporation was Lu Nian’s company. Now, many A-list celebrities were under Lu Nian. Be it movies, television dramas, or stage plays, Chentian Film and Television Corporation was widely loved by audiences.

Song Yu had signed with Chentian Film Corporation.

When Lu Nian heard Auntie Cao’s words, he replied lightly.

Auntie Cao’s eyes lit up. She asked curiously, “Previously, the movie starring Sixth Miss has already won her the Best Actress award at the White Horse Awards. I wonder if she’ll win the Hundred Flowers Award this time?”

Auntie Cao asked this question because Lu Nian probably knew a lot of inside information about the entertainment industry.

“I didn’t pay attention!” Lu Nian said coldly.

Song Yu’s enthusiasm was completely extinguished by Lu Nian’s indifference. She frowned slightly. She was an artiste under Second Brother. Even if Second Brother didn’t pay direct attention to her, shouldn’t he pay attention to his company’s artiste?

“Second Brother, actually, I…”

“You don’t have to say anything,” Lu Nian interrupted Song Yu mercilessly. His face instantly turned cold as he said, “Do you think I don’t know how you stole someone else’s role?”

When Song Yu heard Lu Nian’s words, she felt aggrieved. “Second Brother, don’t you think that the female lead’s character is very similar to mine? I think that character suits me very well. I can play the role better!”

“You?” Lu Nian looked at Song Yu coldly, as if he had heard a joke. The disdain in his eyes was obvious. “This is what you think.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Lu Nian’s words were like a knife stabbing into Song Yu’s chest. Song Yu looked at Lu Nian with red eyes. She did not understand why no matter how hard she tried, Second Brother felt that she was a bad woman.

She had clearly relied on her own efforts to climb up the ranks. Moreover, the entertainment industry was a circle of deception. It was normal for her to play some tricks when necessary. Why did Second Brother feel that she had done something sinister and cunning?
