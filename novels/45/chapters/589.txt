Was he not good enough? Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

That night at the MY hotel, he had only pressed her under him, but she had thrown a tantrum.

That night, he was certain that Qiao Nian was very likely to have a mild fear of men, but that symptom…

“How long do you want to keep this a secret from me?!” The more Matriarch Gu thought about it, the angrier she became. At this moment, she couldn’t be bothered to be sad anymore. She leaned back in her recliner and said disconsolately, “The domineering CEOs of other companies have all married their young wives. Their young wives don’t even touch the ground every day, and their legs are trembling so much that they can’t get out of bed. Yet you…”

Qiao Nian sat down beside Matriarch Gu and looked at her in disbelief.

Their feet barely touched the ground?

Their legs were trembling?

Unable to get out of bed?

She was stunned. Matriarch Gu was well-versed in novels about domineering CEOs.

Seeing Qiao Nian like this, Matriarch Gu’s heart ached even more for her. She said gently, “Nian Nian, it’s been hard on you!”

Qiao Nian didn’t know how to explain herself anymore. She felt that Matriarch Gu had misunderstood, but it was better for Gu Zhou to explain this misunderstanding.

“This grandson of mine isn’t good enough. Fortunately, our family still has some money. When we get back, we’ll buy something to make you happy. Don’t be sad!” Matriarch Gu comforted Qiao Nian earnestly.

Qiao Nian really didn’t know what to say. She looked at Gu Zhou for help.

Gu Zhou coughed and said, “Grandma, it’s not what you think.”

Matriarch Gu frowned at Gu Zhou and sighed helplessly. “What do you mean?”

“Literally.”

“In other words, the two of you are just not pregnant yet?” Matriarch Gu heaved a sigh of relief. Then, she looked at Qiao Nian. “Nian Nian, I’ll have to trouble you in the future.”

Qiao Nian didn’t know whether to agree or not. She gave a polite smile and stopped talking.

Matriarch Gu leaned back in her chair and looked at Gu Zhou. “I heard from the butler that you brought back a child.”

“Yes, I brought Little Qi back.”

“That child… cough, cough…” A glint flashed in Matriarch Gu’s eyes, but it quickly disappeared. She pretended to cough weakly.

“Grandma, take your medicine first!” Qiao Nian hurriedly said nervously, worried that Matriarch Gu would become weaker and weaker.

“Okay,” Matriarch Gu replied. After taking the medicine Qiao Nian handed her, she looked up at Qiao Nian. “Nian Nian, go and see if it’s time to eat.”

“Okay.” Qiao Nian stood up and walked out. She knew that Gu Zhou would definitely take this opportunity to ask Grandma to help them hide the truth of their marriage.

After Qiao Nian left, Matriarch Gu turned to look at Gu Zhou. Frowning, she questioned in a low voice, “Are you planning to let that child come back directly? If Nian Nian knows about that child, what will she do?”

“Leave.”

“Then why did you still dare to bring Little Qi back?” Matriarch Gu frowned and said coldly, “You can visit Little Qi every few days!”

“I want Grandma to help me hide the fact that Qiao Nian and I are married in front of Little Qi,” Gu Zhou said calmly.

Matriarch Gu almost suffocated.

Before she could ask Gu Zhou about his plans, Gu Zhou actually wanted to hide the fact of their marriage. “W-what do you mean?”

“I told Qiao Nian that Gu Qi is the child of a friend. Qiao Nian also liked Gu Qi very much and sympathized with him. She thought that Gu Qi simply treated me, his godfather, as his biological father. She and I both wanted to hide the fact that we were married,” Gu Zhou explained with a smile.

Matriarch Gu’s expression changed.

She had watched Gu Zhou grow up. She had always doted on this grandson of hers the most, but she had never expected him to do such a ridiculous thing.

“Are you planning to deceive Nian Nian and Gu Qi?” Matriarch Gu’s voice turned cold.
