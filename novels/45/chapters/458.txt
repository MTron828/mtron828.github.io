The man’s face seemed to be the most perfect masterpiece in heaven. It could be said to be beautiful.

He was wearing a light pink shirt with two buttons unbuttoned. His muscular chest was vaguely visible, and he looked indescribably sexy.

His beauty was comparable to Lu Nian’s.

The only difference was that he had a pair of beautiful blue eyes, which made him look even more flirtatious.

He should be the legendary Black Hell King, Jiang Chi.

Qiao Nian’s expression didn’t change. She couldn’t be bothered to make small talk. Instead, she asked, “Where’s Lu Zhu? I want to see him.”

Jiang Chi had only seen Qiao Nian on screen before. This was the first time he had seen her up close. Even though her gaze was unfriendly, it didn’t affect his feelings for her at all.

Her skin was smooth, and her eyes were clear. The corners of her eyes were upturned, and she looked a little cunning. Her red lips were slightly pursed under her exquisite nose.

She only stood there coldly, but she was still able to vividly express the words ‘unparalleled beauty’.

She was like a sweet candy bar.

Even though he didn’t like candy, he could feel the sweetness from her.

Qiao Nian was indeed the woman who had moved his heart.

Jiang Chi’s thin lips parted slightly as he asked, “What’s your relationship with Lu Zhu? Are you his woman?”

Qiao Nian was slightly taken aback. She hadn’t expected Jiang Chi to ask such a question.

However, when she thought about it, she understood that in order to save her, Lu Zhu had risked his life to block the bullet for her. Now, in order to save Lu Zhu, she had entered the Ghost City alone.

If she told others that she and Lu Zhu were just ordinary friends, probably no one would believe her.

Moreover, she did not want to tarnish Lu Zhu’s reputation.

“I’m his adopted sister,” Qiao Nian replied calmly.

A gentle smile appeared on Jiang Chi’s face. “So you’re only his adopted sister!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Jiang Chi seemed to have realized something. He frowned again and asked, “What did you say? You’re his adopted sister?”

Qiao Nian didn’t understand what Jiang Chi meant now. One moment, he was happy, and the next, he was angry.

However, Qiao Nian still nodded and said, “Yes.”

Jiang Chi’s expression turned even uglier. His blue eyes were like a vast ocean, making one involuntarily fall into them.

Qiao Nian wasn’t in the mood to care about Jiang Chi’s feelings. She looked up at him and asked, “Where’s my brother?”

Jiang Chi’s expression changed slightly. Hearing Qiao Nian call Lu Zhu “Brother” so naturally, he really believed that Qiao Nian and Lu Zhu didn’t have such a dirty relationship.

A trace of jealousy flashed across Jiang Chi’s eyes. Why did Lu Zhu have such a good sister like Qiao Nian?

Qiao Nian didn’t hear Jiang Chi’s answer. Frowning, she asked again, “Where’s my brother?”

This time, Qiao Nian emphasized her words.

Jiang Chi’s phoenix eyes narrowed slightly. He asked with a smile, “Are you that concerned about him?”

“Are you talking nonsense? He’s my brother!”

Qiao Nian looked at Jiang Chi as if he was a fool.

At this moment, Jiang Chi suddenly thought of his brother who had died tragically.

Even though his younger brother had already left the world for three years, he could never forget him.

“I can bring you to see Lu Zhu, but I have to bring you somewhere else first!”

A trace of surprise flashed across Qiao Nian’s eyes. She didn’t understand why Jiang Chi was doing this, but she still followed behind him.

Jiang Chi led her to the back hall. Qiao Nian saw a pure white praying room that looked very holy.

Someone as cold-blooded as Jiang Chi actually believed in God?

Qiao Nian didn’t reply.

When the mercenary opened the praying room door, a gust of cold air instantly hit her. Qiao Nian couldn’t help but shiver.

Qiao Nian looked up and saw that the praying room was surrounded by ice. White cold air filled the air. Even the cross in the middle of the praying room was carved from ice.
