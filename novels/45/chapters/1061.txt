1062 Madam Bai

Gu Zhou glanced at Qiao Nian and said, “The mother of the child is Qiao Nian. If you want to see the child, you have to get the mother’s permission.”

Qiao Nian smiled, her beautiful fox-like eyes crescent-shaped. She said lightly, “Madam Bai, I don’t think you’re interested in children.”

Bai Hui’s frown deepened. Her mood was extremely low. She had never expected Qiao Nian to say such a thing.

Before she came to An City, she had already found out that Gu Zhou had an illegitimate child.

At that time, her thoughts were very simple. She felt that a young lady in her early twenties like Qiao Nian would never accept that her husband was hiding the fact that he had an illegitimate child.

But things didn’t go as planned. That child was actually Qiao Nian’s!

“The child is five years old. Six years ago…” At this point, Bai Hui paused, as if she had thought of something, and her eyes gradually dimmed.

“Six years ago, on August 15, Big Brother asked me to come to An City. He said that he wanted to give me a surprise. In the end, I was schemed against that night.”

Gu Zhou paused for a moment and turned to look at Qiao Nian. Even now, he still felt that it was unreal. He had never expected that the person that night would be Qiao Nian. “Other than me, she was also schemed against!”

Bai Hui’s frown deepened. She pursed her lips tightly and asked after a long while, “Your brother disappeared that day, right?”

“Yes!”

Bai Hui’s beautiful phoenix-like eyes narrowed slightly, her expression serious.

It was too much of a coincidence. Why had both her sons been schemed against that day?

One of her sons had been schemed against and spent the night with a strange woman!

Her other son had disappeared in a car accident!

Was there something else going on?

Who exactly was plotting against the Gu family behind the scenes? Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Bai Hui couldn’t help but recall the situation when she gave birth to Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou was born prematurely. At that time, she had been accidentally poisoned while eating. When Gu Zhou was born, his body was filled with poison.

All of this added up made Bai Hui feel that someone was deliberately targeting the Gu family.

In the past, she didn’t know what had happened to Gu Zhou that night. In the past, she had always felt that Gu Zhou wanted to meet Gu Yue, which was why Gu Yue had gotten into a car accident and his whereabouts were unknown.

Now, it seemed that she had misunderstood Gu Zhou. An invisible pair of hands was manipulating everything behind his back!

Suddenly, Bai Hui felt a pain in her chest. She hurriedly reached out to cover her chest.

“Teacher!” Yu Chu supported Bai Hui in a panic and called out anxiously!

Bai Hui took a few deep breaths, and her face gradually regained its color. She turned to look at Yu Chu beside her and shook her head. “I’m fine. It’s just an old illness!”

She had fallen ill when she gave birth to Gu Zhou. When she was slightly agitated, her chest would ache!

Yu Chu hurriedly helped Bai Hui sit down and poured her a glass of water. “Teacher, do you want some water to calm down?”

Bai Hui shook her head. Only then did she realize that Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian had already left. She looked at Yu Chu with heartache. “You’re still the same as before. You’re really too honest! You don’t even know how to fight for your happiness!”

“Teacher, I’m already very happy now!” Yu Chu smiled and sat down beside Bai Hui, her eyes filled with gratitude. “If it weren’t for Teacher, I might still be like those people in the village. I wouldn’t know how exciting the outside world is.”

Yu Chu recalled the past and couldn’t help but smile.

When she was ten years old, she met Teacher Bai Hui when she was studying in school. At that time, she was the same as everyone else in her class. She came to school every day. She thought that after six years of elementary school, her family would start to help her find a suitable person. Then, she would be preparing to get married.

At that time, the girls in the class were all proud of how well they knew how to do housework. Whoever did their housework well would be able to marry into a good family in the future!

However, Teacher Bai Hui’s appearance changed Yu Chu’s perspective. She had never expected a girl to be able to become so glamorous. She could even be a teacher and teach her classmates on the podium.
