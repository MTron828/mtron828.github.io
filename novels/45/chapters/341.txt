Chapter 342: Familiar Strategy

Qiao Nian didn’t stand on ceremony. She even put the money away. Pursing her lips, she teased, “Isn’t there any interest?”

When Gu Qi heard Qiao Nian’s words, he inexplicably recalled what she had said to Qin Lu.

Our child…

Although he was young, he had experienced many things. Previously, when Auntie dealt with Qin Lu, it was as if his father had helped him teach Zhang Yi a lesson.

She was just like his father.

To Gu Qi, people like his father were good people. They treated him well.

Gu Qi rested his chin on his hands and stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian, looking like an adult. He said, “I’ll treat you to dessert today. Take it as interest!”

Qiao Nian’s eyes sparkled like stars in the night sky. Her intelligence instantly dropped. Smiling, she said, “Wow, our family’s Gu Qi is rich now. Then I’m going to eat delicious desserts!”

When Gu Qi heard the words “our family”, his lips curved up involuntarily. He nodded domineeringly and said, “Yes, you can eat whatever you want. I have the ability to pay you back!”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned.

Why did she find it so familiar?

Then, Gu Qi said considerately, “I only brought fifteen yuan today. I’ve already returned it to you. I’ll return the rest to you later.”

Qiao Nian smiled. This was a familiar strategy.

“Sure!” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Gu Qi raised his chin and said seriously, “Order the most expensive dish!”

In that instant, Qiao Nian felt as if she was being pampered by a domineering CEO. She didn’t stand on ceremony and chose two branded drinks, along with a small cake. It was a total of 100 yuan.

“Is this enough?”

Gu Qi nodded without hesitation. “No problem.”

After the service staff took the menu away, Qiao Nian looked at Gu Qi. Gu Qi was quite good-looking. His fox-like eyes were a little round, like those of a peach blossom. His fine hair made him look cool.

For some reason, Qiao Nian felt that this face was a little familiar, but she couldn’t remember where she had seen it before.

When Gu Qi was disguised as a girl, he was obedient and cute. Now, he looked handsome as a man.

In that instant, Qiao Nian recalled her deceased child. If that child was still alive, he would probably be the same age as Gu Qi. She wondered if he would be as adorable as Gu Qi.

Qiao Nian recalled that Gu Qi had specially dressed up as a girl. She asked curiously, “Gu Qi, you’re a boy. Why were you pretending to be a girl?”

When Gu Qi heard Qiao Nian’s words, his bright eyes gradually dimmed. He lowered his head in disappointment, his hands intertwined.

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She said apologetically, “Gu Qi, if you don’t want to tell me, then forget it. I’m just…”

“Because…” Gu Qi lowered his head and interrupted Qiao Nian in a low voice, his voice tinged with disappointment. “Dad seems to prefer girls.”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Qi’s words, she was stunned. Worried that she had heard wrongly, she couldn’t help but ask, “So you want your father to like you?”

Gu Qi nodded seriously.

Hearing Gu Qi’s words, Qiao Nian’s heart seemed to be gripped by an invisible hand. It hurt terribly.

A child would rather suffer and dress up like a girl just because his father liked girls?

This father was really too incompetent!

Qiao Nian frowned slightly and said gently, “Gu Qi, you don’t have to change yourself for others. You are who you are. You are unique in this world, so you just have to be yourself. Do you understand?”

Gu Qi seemed to understand. He nodded seriously. “So, even if I’m a boy, Dad will still like me?”

Hearing Gu Qi’s question, Qiao Nian’s heart ached. This child was too adorable. “Where’s Mom?”
