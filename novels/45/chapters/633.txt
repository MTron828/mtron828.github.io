If only Gu Qi had come from Qiao Nian’s stomach.

Sigh.

Matriarch Gu sighed. In a daze, she recalled how Gu Zhou and her eldest brother had looked when they were young. The two of them were serious people, and the most common game they played was reading.

Qiao Nian was playing with Gu Qi when her phone suddenly rang.

“Little Qi, Auntie is going to take a call. Be careful not to fall.” Although Qiao Nian said this, her hands were still carefully supporting Gu Qi, worried that he would fall off the swing.

Qiao Nian took out her phone with her other hand. When she saw the caller ID, her heart began to race uncontrollably.

Lu Nian.

Had Big Brother already told Second Brother that she was Sugar?

Otherwise, why would Second Brother suddenly call her? Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Filled with trepidation and excitement, Qiao Nian picked up the call. She tried hard to sound calm. “Hello.”

“Girl, why aren’t you calling me brother anymore?”

Lu Nian’s voice was very pleasant to the ear. It was like flowing water in the mountains, clear and sweet.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but feel nervous. Her palms were covered in sweat.

It seemed that Big Brother had already told Second Brother everything.

Oh my god, she wasn’t mentally prepared. What should she do?

Qiao Nian’s heart was beating faster and faster. In fact, her emotions were exactly the same as when she had first reunited with her eldest brother. She felt uneasy, terrified, and nervous. There was also a hint of joy and excitement.

“Well?”

His voice was very clear and slightly raised.

As expected of a musician. A casual tone of voice sounded like a perfect movement.

Qiao Nian had never expected to reunite with Second Brother on the phone.

Biting her lip slightly, she asked uneasily, “Do you know everything?”

The other end of the phone paused for a moment. Lu Nian’s puzzled voice came through. “What should I know?”

Qiao Nian was instantly petrified.

Could she have misunderstood?

Her heart was like a roller coaster. It had just been at a high point, but now, it had already sunk to the bottom.

On the other side of the phone.

Although Lu Nian didn’t know what Qiao Nian was talking about, and he couldn’t see her face, he could tell from Qiao Nian’s rapid breathing that she was very nervous.

Strange, why was Qiao Nian nervous?

“Sister Nian, are you feeling unwell?” Lu Nian asked worriedly.

Qiao Nian stopped Gu Qi’s swing and covered her chest with her hand, finally calming herself down.

Second Brother called her Sister Nian, but not Sugar. In other words, Second Brother didn’t know who she was.

Hearing Lu Nian’s words of concern for her, Qiao Nian’s heart warmed. Her second brother still cared about her so much.

Fortunately, her eldest brother wasn’t careless. Otherwise, she might have rashly acknowledged him as her family over the phone.

When Qiao Nian thought everything through, the corners of her lips curved up slightly. She called out sweetly, “Brother Ah Nian!”

Her voice was clear and sweet.

Lu Nian was slightly stunned. He replied in a daze, “Yes.”

He didn’t understand why Qiao Nian was so happy.

Could it be that she was happy because he cared about her?

Only then did Qiao Nian ask, “Brother Ah Nian, why did you call?”

“I’ve written a new song. I want you to listen to it first.”

Qiao Nian’s eyes lit up. Her lips curved up involuntarily as she asked with interest, “When?”

“Are you free tonight?” Lu Nian asked.

Gu Qi looked at Qiao Nian’s happy expression, his eyes flickering with curiosity. He didn’t know why Auntie Nian Nian was so happy.

He got off the swing and walked up to Qiao Nian. Reaching out, he grabbed Qiao Nian’s sleeve and looked up at her.

Qiao Nian squatted down and her gaze fell on Gu Qi’s face, signaling for him not to speak.

She was still very hesitant, because the embroidered pouch she was making for the eldest daughter of the Lu family was not ready yet. However, Second Brother had invited her to attend the reveal party, and she really wanted to listen to the song.

She wondered if there was enough time.

Forget it. At most, he would just embroider it in the middle of the night!

On the other end of the line, Lu Nian didn’t hear Qiao Nian’s voice. “If you’re not free tonight, why don’t…”

“Okay, I’m free. Where are you? I want to go,” Qiao Nian said eagerly.
