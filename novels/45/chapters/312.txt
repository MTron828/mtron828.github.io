Chapter 313: Borrowing Money

She was the one who had called Gu Zhou to clarify things for her. However, she had not expected Mr. Dong Hua to take the initiative to post on Weibo to appoint her as his female musician.

Fortunately, this matter had been resolved, and her life had returned to normal.

At night, Qiao Nian returned to the Gu family villa. Just as she reached her room, she heard Gu Zhou on the phone.

Gu Zhou’s voice was low, and Qiao Nian couldn’t hear him clearly.

“I’ll be there right away. No matter what, you have to find it!”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. This was the first time she had seen Gu Zhou so anxious. Had Gu Zhou lost something important?

Before Qiao Nian could think clearly, Gu Zhou turned around and saw her.

Their eyes met.

Before Qiao Nian could speak, she saw Gu Zhou’s guilty expression. However, Gu Zhou quickly regained his composure.

“Are you planning to go out?” Smiling, Qiao Nian walked in and asked casually.

“Yes,” Gu Zhou answered.

Qiao Nian put down the violin and sat at the side, reading the scores Brother Cao had sent her. Mr. Dong Hua’s concert was at eight o’clock tomorrow night. She wanted to memorize all the scores before the concert began.

This was a huge project. She could not relax at all.

......

Gu Zhou had been worried that Qiao Nian would ask him what he was doing outside. Now that he saw that Qiao Nian was looking at her phone, he frowned slightly and asked, “Shouldn’t you be asking me where I’m going?”

Qiao Nian was memorizing her score. When she heard Gu Zhou’s voice, she froze for a moment and looked at him in confusion. “Why should I ask?”

Gu Zhou was speechless.

Qiao Nian was speechless.

After five seconds of silence, Gu Zhou left with a cold expression. Qiao Nian lowered her head and continued reading her scores.

Unless there was a billion-yuan business opportunity, no one could disturb her.

By the time Qiao Nian finished memorizing all the scores, it was already midnight. She put down her phone and saw that Gu Zhou had not returned. She wanted to practice with the violin, but she was worried that her voice would disturb Matriarch Gu, so she picked up the phone and called Xiao Xiao.

“Are you busy?”

“Yes, a little.”

Xiao Xiao’s voice sounded a little distant. She must have put her phone aside and put it on speaker.

“Are there any guests?”

“No, just me. It’s very quiet here.”

“I’ll go look for you now.” Qiao Nian smiled.

There was a pause on the other end of the line, followed by Xiao Xiao’s voice. “Why do you want to come here? This is a funeral parlor. Don’t tell me you’re here to practice your instrument again!”

“Xiao Xiao, you’re so smart. Be good and wait for me there!”

With that, Qiao Nian hung up.

Practicing the violin required a quiet place. Moreover, one of the songs was written for the loved ones who had passed away. If she could practice it in the funeral home, it would be easier for her to inject her soul into it. It should sublimate the entire song.

Forty minutes later, Qiao Nian arrived at the funeral home. After parking the car, she took out her phone and was about to call Xiao Xiao when she heard a young child’s voice. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Auntie, can you lend me ten dollars?”

Qiao Nian was startled. She turned around and saw a beautiful little girl standing under the streetlamp.

There was a shadow.

Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. Since this little girl had a shadow, it meant that she wasn’t a ghost.

To be honest, it was indeed strange to meet a child asking to borrow money from her in a funeral parlor filled with dead people in the middle of the night.

Of course, no matter who it was, their first reaction would be that they had run into a ghost.

Qiao Nian walked towards the little girl. Only when she got closer did she get a good look at her.

This little girl looked to be only four years old. Her eyes looked like those of a fox, and also like those of a peach blossom.

The little girl’s long, curly hair made her exquisite facial features look exceptionally adorable.
