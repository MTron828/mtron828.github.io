969 Die Together

Before Qiao Nian could react, Gu Zhou placed her on the bed.

Fear instantly spread throughout her body. Just as she was about to escape, Gu Zhou had already pounced on her.

Sunlight filtered through the white curtains. The room was bathed in gentle sunlight, like the clouds in Qiao Nian’s nightmare.

At this moment, she saw Gu Zhou reach out his slender fingers and unbutton his shirt slowly. His muscular chest was gradually revealed, and she could vaguely see his sexy muscles.

!!

Qiao Nian frowned. She had already guessed what Gu Zhou was going to do. “What do you want to do?”

Gu Zhou lowered his body slightly. Qiao Nian’s flustered face was reflected in his dark eyes, which were filled with aggression.

Qiao Nian’s eyes were filled with panic. She placed her hands on Gu Zhou’s chest and subconsciously wanted to push him away, but she couldn’t. She swallowed and tried hard to remain calm. “Get up quickly. I…”

“I want to be with you for real.” As Gu Zhou spoke, he placed his left hand on the side of Qiao Nian’s pillow and gently tucked her hair behind her ear with his right hand.

Qiao Nian still wanted to push Gu Zhou away, but Gu Zhou pressed himself down and kissed her lips without hesitation.

The situation six years ago and the current situation alternated in her mind.

At that time, the feeling of suffocation and fear gradually disappeared, leaving only heartache.

Gu Zhou raised his body slightly and their eyes met.

“We’ll share the same bed in life or death. Don’t even think about leaving me again in this life!”

The man’s voice was low, sexy, and domineering.

Qiao Nian’s face turned red uncontrollably, and her heart began to race. She wanted to speak, but Gu Zhou covered her lips again.

The room was filled with passion.

… .

At the hospital.

Qiao Shan sat on the hospital bed, looking at the headlines on his phone with a pale face.

“The daughter of the Qiao Corporation, Qiao Xin, personally broke her father’s leg. Her father’s injury has been condemned by everyone!”

His fingers trembled as he scrolled through the comments. The comments below were all scolding Qiao Xin, each worse than the last. In a rage, he smashed his phone against the wall.

Slam!

The phone shattered instantly.

When Su Xue pushed open the door, she happened to see Qiao Shan smashing his phone. She was so frightened that her heart was about to jump out of her throat. She took a deep breath and walked to the bed with dinner. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Brother Shan, eat something!” Su Xue had just returned from Qiao Xin’s place. Every time she went to Qiao Xin’s ward, she was always worried that she would bump into Gu Zhou and that her leg would be broken.

Qiao Shan stared coldly at the shattered phone. Without even looking at Su Xue, he said coldly, “Gu Zhou is really unscrupulous. He directly made Qiao Xin breaking my leg a trending topic!”

When Su Xue heard this, although what Qiao Xin had done disappointed her, Qiao Xin was still her daughter. How could she bear to let her daughter suffer? She hurriedly said, “This… does the Gu family want to force us to our deaths?”

“No!” Qiao Shan shook his head slightly and looked away from his phone. His gaze fell on Su Xue’s face and he said, “He probably just wants to ruin Qiao Xin’s reputation.”

Su Xue placed the food on the bedside table, then took out the dining table and laid it out. She placed the food on the dining table again and sat down opposite Qiao Shan. “Let’s eat first!”

When Su Xue was in Qiao Xin’s room, she was so frightened that she didn’t dare to eat. She was afraid that Gu Zhou would come over in the next moment.

Qiao Shan picked up his chopsticks and said lightly, “Buy me another phone later!”

“Okay.” As Su Xue spoke, she handed the chopsticks to Qiao Shan. “Do you want to spend money to remove Qiao Xin’s trending topic?”

These trending topics were all bought with money. Of course, they could also be suppressed with money. Although Su Xue was bitterly disappointed in Qiao Xin, Qiao Xin was still her daughter. She couldn’t bear to let so many people scold her daughter.

Qiao Shan’s expression instantly darkened. He looked up, his eyes cold. “You want your legs to be broken too?”

Su Xue was slightly stunned. Her eyes gradually dimmed as she said in a low voice, “Then… then what about Lu Zhu?”

Qiao Shan placed his chopsticks heavily on the table. What was there to eat now? He was already full of anger. He said angrily, “She really knows how to make me worry. She provoked the Gu family and the Lu family. She’s simply lawless!”
