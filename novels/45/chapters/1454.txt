1455 How is that possible?

Just now, Lina had been arranged to be sent to the hospital in an ambulance. Dr. Ollie was also in that car. Dr. Ollie gave Lina an IV drip first, preparing for her to enter the operating theater later.

But he had never expected Lina to bleed profusely.

Chen Qing was also in that car. As soon as he stopped the car, Lina was sent to the operating theater by the medical staff.

Chen Qing reported the situation to Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian frowned, her face turning pale. She muttered softly, “How is this possible?”

Previously, she had already treated Lina’s wound and used acupuncture needles to stop her bleeding. Logically speaking, Lina shouldn’t be bleeding profusely.

Qiao Nian immediately got out of the car and was about to walk towards the operating theater when Gu Zhou also got out of the car. In a few steps, he walked over to Qiao Nian and comforted her in a low voice, “Don’t worry, let’s go over and take a look at the situation first. I think it’ll be fine.”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she nodded slightly.

Chen Qing led Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian towards the operating theater. The lights at the entrance of the operating theater were dazzling. Many medical staff were entering and exiting, all of them looking serious.

When Qiao Nian reached the door of the operating theater, she was stopped by a tall doctor.

“Madam, please wait here. Professor Ollie doesn’t want outsiders to interfere when he undergoes surgery!”

The doctor’s tone was cold, and there was a trace of impatience in her words. Her eyes were filled with disdain for Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian wasn’t angry. Her mind was filled with Lina’s safety. She asked nervously, “How’s the patient now?”

The doctor frowned and said, “Professor Ollie has just stopped the patient’s bleeding, but the patient is still unconscious. I heard from Professor Ollie that the patient’s condition is a little special. Professor Ollie is preparing other plans.”

Qiao Nian frowned slightly. Lina was only suffering from external injuries. Why did he say that her condition was special? Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Just as Qiao Nian was feeling puzzled, the door of the operating theater opened and an old man with white hair walked out.

There was still a lot of blood on the old man’s white coat. Exhausted, he took off the medical gloves on his hands. The doctor who had refused to let Qiao Nian into the operating theater immediately took the gloves from the old doctor.

Two more doctors came out one after another. The two doctors stood in front of the old man. The old man looked at the three doctors in front of him and questioned coldly, “Who touched the silver needles on the Seventh Princess?”

The doctor who had rejected Qiao Nian snorted and gritted her teeth indignantly. In her opinion, Asian acupuncture was useless. There was no scientific basis for it.

Previously, in order to stop the bleeding, Qiao Nian had left behind a few silver needles. When she heard the old man’s question, she roughly understood why Lina had suddenly bled profusely.

Some people probably didn’t know what the silver needles on Lina’s body were and casually moved them.

Gu Zhou frowned. If someone had touched the silver needles on the Seventh Princess and caused her to fail to survive, the person who had touched the silver needles would be the culprit who killed the Seventh Princess.

He frowned, his eyes cold. He looked at the three young doctors in front of him, as if he wanted to find the culprit who had harmed the Seventh Princess.

No one spoke. The old man walked up to Gu Zhou and said in a low voice, “Some of them touched the silver needles on the Seventh Princess, which is why she’s bleeding non-stop. The Seventh Princess’s condition is a little dangerous now.”

When the three young doctors heard the old man’s words, a trace of panic flashed across their faces.

“Dr. Ollie, I didn’t do it!” the young female doctor said.

“Dr. Ollie, I just entered the operating theater. I still don’t know what happened. I didn’t do this!” the short male doctor said.

Everyone’s gaze fell on the tall doctor who had treated Qiao Nian coldly.

The doctor raised her eyebrows slightly and said fearlessly, “Those needles were inserted into the princess’s body. It must have hurt a lot, so I pulled them out!”

When Dr. Ollie heard the doctor’s words, his expression instantly darkened. “Kate, who asked you to make the decision on your own!”
