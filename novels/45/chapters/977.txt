978 Scared

She didn’t know why He Cheng had left so quickly. Worried that she would be delayed if she walked too slowly, she jogged after him.

“Um…” Lu Qi had just opened her mouth when she met He Cheng’s lewd gaze.

He Cheng had just been thinking about what he would do to Lu Qi, but he didn’t expect Lu Qi to look at him. He could only smile.

Lu Qi’s smile only froze for a moment, but she quickly regained her composure. Without batting an eyelid, she asked with a smile, “Where are my fourth brother and the others now?”

“At the Red Bar now,” He Cheng said politely.

Lu Qi nodded. The moment she turned around, she looked flustered.

She had never expected Fourth Brother to send such a despicable person to pick her up.

A trace of surprise flashed in Lu Qi’s eyes, but she also found it strange. Why would Fourth Brother find such a person to pick her up?

Unless this person was not sent by Fourth Brother.

He Cheng looked at Lu Qi’s back, his heart in a mess. Would this little girl have noticed his abnormality just now?

No, he could not let a cooked duck go to waste!

He Cheng walked to Lu Qi’s side and said with a smile, “Miss Lu, your book is so heavy. Why don’t I carry it for you?”

Lu Qi also wanted to test He Cheng. When she heard He Cheng’s question, she said, “I still want to read the book in the car later. I’ll just take it. How should I address you?”

“Cheng He,” He Cheng said.

“Brother Cheng, how long have you known my brother? I don’t think I’ve seen you before.” Lu Qi smiled at He Cheng and asked gently.

He Cheng looked at Lu Qi and explained gently, “I used to work overseas. I only came back these few months!”

“I see.” Lu Qi smiled and said, “Brother Cheng, do you have a girlfriend? I have many classmates. Do you want me to introduce a girlfriend to you?”

Lu Qi was now completely certain that this person called Cheng He was definitely not sent by Fourth Brother.

Lu Qi hugged the book in her hand tightly. Her phone was on the page. She only hugged the book in her arms. After her fingerprints were unlocked, she replayed it.

The call went through very quickly. Lu Jiang was about to speak when Lu Qi’s sweet voice came through the phone.

“Brother Cheng, what kind of girl do you like? My brother is always single. I want to be a matchmaker!”

Lu Jiang was slightly stunned. He didn’t understand who the “Brother Cheng” Lu Qi was referring to was. He vaguely realized that something was wrong and didn’t speak again.

“Miss Lu, you really think too highly of me. I’m just an errand boy. How can I be worthy of such a good young lady like you?” He Cheng said with an honest smile.

When Lu Jiang heard this, his expression changed and his eyes widened involuntarily.

It was He Cheng!

He Cheng had actually gone to look for Lu Qi! Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Lu Jiang’s heart was in a mess. He hurriedly sent a message to his secretary, Xu Jian, asking him to pick Lu Qi up from university. Then, he took out his phone and began to search for Lu Qi’s location.

At this moment, Lu Zhu, who was also in the office, was also nervous. He immediately walked to Lu Jiang’s side and asked anxiously, “What happened?”

“He Cheng seems to be going to kidnap Lu Qi now!” Lu Jiang said solemnly.

Lu Zhu’s heart instantly rose to his throat. He felt as if he had returned to when he was young and Sugar was kidnapped.

… .

Qiao Nian drove to the entrance of Lu Qi’s school. She wanted to try her luck, but her luck was really good. From afar, she saw Lu Qi and He Cheng coming out of the school.

When her gaze fell on the fake smile on He Cheng’s face, she was so frightened that her heart jumped to her throat.

He Cheng!

What was he doing here?

She drove the car to the side of the road and saw Lu Qi talking to He Cheng perfunctorily.

She got out of the car. There were not many people at the school gate. With the help of the cars and trees by the roadside, Qiao Nian quickly approached Lu Qi.

Lu Qi’s gaze inadvertently fell on Qiao Nian’s face. Her eyes lit up, but only for a moment. Soon, they dimmed. She shook her head gently at Qiao Nian.

She really hadn’t expected Sister Qiao Nian to be here.

Lu Qi was feigning civility with He Cheng absent-mindedly, but her mind was thinking that even if she was kidnapped, Sister Qiao Nian would probably find someone to save her as soon as possible.
