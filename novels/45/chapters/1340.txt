1341 Giving Birth

When Qiao Nian heard Xiao Shi’s words, she couldn’t help but laugh. Just as she was about to speak, she heard Xiao Shi say, “As long as Dad drinks water from the Women’s country, he will have a baby!”

Qiao Nian’s heart ached for Gu Zhou, who was far away on the hospital bed in MY. His gunshot wound had yet to recover, and all his daughter could think about was getting him to give birth. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Holding Xiao Shi’s hand, Qiao Nian explained seriously, “Xiao Shi, those are all mythical dramas. The things in them are all imagined by people, but in fact, men can’t have children.”

“Oh.” Xiao Shi lowered her head in disappointment, her small hands intertwined in front of her. After a long time, she looked at Qiao Nian happily and asked expectantly, “Mommy, then you and Daddy can give us a younger brother and sister!”

Qiao Nian looked at Xiao Shi in confusion. Why did Xiao Shi always want more siblings?

Seeing that Qiao Nian was silent, a bright smile appeared on Xiao Shi’s face. Thinking that Qiao Nian had agreed to her request, she clapped happily and said, “Mommy, you’re the best. Xiao Shi loves you the most.”

Qiao Nian: I don’t think I said anything!

Xiao Shi said happily, “Then when I see Daddy, I’ll tell Daddy that Mommy still wants to give birth to Daddy’s children!”

“I—”

Before Qiao Nian could finish speaking, Xiao Shi had already turned to look at Gu Qi and asked happily, “Brother, are you very happy? We’re going to have a younger brother or sister?”

Gu Qi looked at the stars in Xiao Shi’s eyes and his heart skipped a beat.

Xiao Shi was usually very cheerful but indifferent to everything. This was the first time Gu Qi had seen Xiao Shi so persistent about something.

He recalled that Xiao Shi had lived a bitter life with Song Man in the past.

Previously, he had thought that Song Man was his mother. He had pretended to be Xiao Shi to interact with her, but Song Man had slapped him.

Xiao Shi had suffered too much in the past. He only had one sister, so of course he had to dote on her unconditionally.

Gu Qi nodded solemnly and said, “Yes, I’m happy. I also hope that Dad and Mommy can give birth to a few more younger siblings.”

Qiao Nian felt terrible. What was going on with these two children today?

Usually, Gu Qi would never pay attention to these things. If Gu Zhou heard Gu Qi and Xiao Shi’s words, he might think that she really wanted to have children and think that she was too embarrassed to say it directly and ask the two children to help convey her thoughts.

Perhaps it would be useless no matter how she explained it.

She had given birth once. After giving birth, she thought that her children were gone. She was in a daze.

Ever since then, she had no intention of having a child.

Even if she found the children now, she only wanted to take good care of them. As for giving birth, she didn’t want to consider it for the time being.

Qiao Nian hurriedly changed the topic and said, “We’ll be home soon. You’ll be able to see Xiao Bao.”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, the two children’s attention instantly shifted.

“Mommy, was Second Brother doing well there in the past?” Xiao Shi asked in a childish voice, her big black grape-like eyes fixed on Qiao Nian.

When Lu Zhu heard Xiao Shi’s question, he looked at Qiao Nian in the rearview mirror and saw her conflicted expression.

“We’ll be home soon.” Lu Zhu helped Qiao Nian resolve the awkwardness.

As soon as he finished speaking, the car stopped at the entrance of the Gu family villa.

The two children walked into the living room hand in hand.

Lu Zhu followed Qiao Nian behind. Seeing that Qiao Nian looked troubled, he asked, “What happened?”

“Brother, this matter is a little complicated.” Seeing that the two children were relatively far away from them, Qiao Nian looked around. Seeing that there was no one around, she looked at Lu Zhu and said in a low voice, “There’s a dark force that not only wants to devour the Gu family, but also the Lu family.”

When Lu Zhu heard Qiao Nian’s words, his expression changed slightly. “I’ve more or less heard about what happened to you in MY. It was Cui Huai from the HH Group who chased after Gu Zhou.”

Qiao Nian pursed her lips and nodded, heaving a sigh of relief. “Cui Huai is someone who appears in front of the public. There are other forces behind him. We have to be especially careful in the future.”
