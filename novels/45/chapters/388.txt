Chapter 389: Unable to Love

Jiang Yue’s heart was in her throat as she said, “Something happened at the company. He went back first.”

Song Yu asked with concern, “Is it serious?”

“It’s fine, it’s fine. Brother Ah Zhou can resolve it!” Jiang Yue said with a smile.

Thinking about it, it made sense. There was probably nothing in this world that could stump Gu Zhou.

“It’s not safe for you to take a taxi alone at this hour. Let me send you back!” Song Yu said with a smile.

“This… Isn’t this inconvenient?” Although Jiang Yue said that, she hoped that Song Yu could send her home.

“There’s nothing inconvenient about it. I have something to ask you too. Come in!” Song Yu smiled at Jiang Yue.

Jiang Yue thanked her before getting into the front passenger seat and putting on her seatbelt.

Therefore, until now, Brother Ah Zhou did not know her feelings at all.

If Brother Ah Zhou knew her feelings, he might agree.

At the thought of this, Jiang Yue’s lips curled up slightly as she looked at Song Yu gratefully. “Sister Song Yu, thank you so much. I know what to do in the future.”

Song Yu smiled and shook her head. “You’re welcome.”

Song Yu thought of Qiao Nian and pretended to be casual. She asked, “By the way, Jiang Yue, don’t you think Qiao Nian seems to have a good relationship with Brother Ah Zhou?”

When Jiang Yue heard the words “Qiao Nian”, she lowered her eyes slightly, a trace of panic flashing across them.

Even Song Yu could tell that Brother Ah Zhou and Qiao Nian had a good relationship. He had already recovered from his phobia of women.

Song Yu smiled and said, “Qiao Nian’s medical skills are very brilliant. She’s also treating Grandma and Brother Ah Zhou, so they’re familiar with each other.”
