Chapter 380: Framed

Gu Zhou said nothing and walked upstairs.

Jiang Yue followed behind Gu Zhou.

Chen Qing followed suit.

Jiang Yue rolled her eyes and comforted him. “Brother Ah Zhou, don’t worry too much. I think Second Sister-in-law is just tired, so she went to the lounge to rest.”

Gu Zhou did not speak, but his footsteps quickened involuntarily.

When the two of them reached the second floor, they heard the faint moans of a woman and the rough breathing of a man coming from one of the rooms. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Jiang Yue’s eyes flickered with joy, but she quickly regained her composure.

“Brother Ah Zhou, don’t you think that woman’s voice sounds like Second Sister-in-law’s?” Jiang Yue walked side by side to Gu Zhou and turned to ask.

When everyone walked to the door, ambiguous voices came from the room.

When Chen Qing heard the woman’s voice in the room, a trace of panic flashed in his heart.

Could Second Young Madam be with someone else?

No, he could not let Second Young Master see this scene.

Before Chen Qing could speak, Jiang Yue kicked the door open.

The ambiguous voices instantly grew louder. Without even looking, one could tell from the voices how intense their session was.

Since their backs were facing the door, their faces could not be seen at all.

When Jiang Yue saw this, her lips curved up involuntarily. It seemed that Qin Lu was quite reliable.

Chen Qing looked at the blinding scene inside and silently turned his back.

Gu Zhou frowned slightly. A trace of coldness flashed in his eyes as he looked at Jiang Yue’s face.

Jiang Yue felt a chill run down her spine under Gu Zhou’s gaze. She hurriedly looked away and rushed in angrily. “What are the two of you doing?!”

Even though Jiang Yue’s reprimand was loud, the two people entangled together on the sofa didn’t seem to hear her at all.

Jiang Yue recalled Gu Zhou’s gaze just now and felt a little uneasy. But now, her mind was filled with something else.

If Brother Ah Zhou knew that Qiao Nian was with another man, he would definitely divorce her.

With this thought in mind, Jiang Yue pretended to look at the two people on the sofa in disappointment and reprimanded loudly, “Qiao Nian, you’ve gone too far. How could you do something to hurt Brother Ah Zhou!”

Standing at the door, Gu Zhou’s eyes turned cold. He asked coldly, “Who told you that the woman lying below is Qiao Nian?”

Jiang Yue’s heart skipped a beat, but she quickly composed herself. She turned to look at Gu Zhou and said earnestly, “Brother Ah Zhou, the truth is right in front of us. We can’t run away. Moreover, I can tell that this is Qiao Nian’s voice!”

Seeing that Gu Zhou still refused to believe her, Jiang Yue made up her mind and walked over, pulling the man away from the woman.

Brother Ah Zhou would only dislike Qiao Nian when he saw her with another man!

It took Jiang Yue a lot of effort to pull the man up.

It was only during this laborious tug that the two of them, who were immersed in lust, came back to their senses.

The man was the waiter. Previously, he had disguised himself as a woman to lure Qiao Nian to the second floor.

When the waiter saw Gu Zhou’s dark face, he froze on the sofa. Inch by inch, he turned his head to look at the woman on the sofa, who also had a terrified expression.

The woman looked confused. When she regained consciousness, she screamed and quickly crawled to the side of the coffee table to cover her body with a tablecloth.

When Jiang Yue saw the woman’s face clearly, she felt as if she was in an ice cave.

What was going on?

How did it become Qin Lu?

Jiang Yue finally managed to stabilize herself. She turned around and saw Gu Zhou’s gaze growing colder and colder.
