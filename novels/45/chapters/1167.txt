1168 Shot to Death

The guests below the stage all shouted. For a moment, the entire church was in a mess.

Thank you readers!

Several men in black suits and sunglasses walked in through the church door. They raised their guns in her direction. Their target was clearly her.

Qiao Nian frowned, not understanding what had happened.

Seeing this, Mr. Chen shielded Qiao Nian behind him and fled with her.

The gunshot resounded throughout the church, and bullets flew past them!

Qiao Nian’s face was pale. She and Mr. Chen had already fled to a corner.

The men surrounded her and Mr. Chen, all guns aimed at her. Qiao Nian lowered her head slightly and could see dense red dots on her body.

Qiao Nian knew that she would definitely die. Her mind was in a mess.

In the next moment, Mr. Chen shielded her in his arms. All the bullets hit him.

Mr. Chen’s body was already riddled with holes. Qiao Nian’s heart ached so much that tears streamed down her face. She cried and wanted to hug Mr. Chen tightly. In the next moment, she was pushed out of the window by Mr. Chen.

She didn’t fall. A man under the window hugged her. All she could think about was how Mr. Chen had taken the bullet for her. Mr. Chen’s back was covered in bullets. At the thought of this, Qiao Nian was in so much pain that she was about to faint.

However, Mr. Chen was still upstairs. Qiao Nian struggled to save him, but the group of men in suits chased after her again!

Qiao Nian looked up at Mr. Chen, who had collapsed by the window. Mr. Chen looked at her lovingly, his eyes filled with reluctance. His lips parted slightly, but in the end, he only said three words.

—I love you!

Before Qiao Nian could react, the man carrying her ran into the forest with her!

Mr. Chen’s eyelids gradually lowered. He pressed the button in his hand, and the entire church instantly exploded like fireworks!

“No…” Qiao Nian shouted!

She had never expected Mr. Chen to die with those people.

“No! No! No!”

Qiao Nian’s eyes flew open, and her breathing quickened!

She turned her head and saw Gu Zhou’s concerned eyes. Tears of sadness fell from her eyes. She held Gu Zhou’s hand in tears and said anxiously, “Hurry up and save him!”

Whenever she thought of how Mr. Chen had blocked all the bullets for her in order to save her, her heart ached so much that it was difficult to breathe.

“Save who?” Gu Zhou knew that Qiao Nian was having a nightmare, but he didn’t expose her. He pulled Qiao Nian into his arms and gently patted her back, coaxing her like he was coaxing a child. “I’ll save him now. Who is he? Where is he?”

At this moment, Qiao Nian had yet to come out of her dream. She lay in Gu Zhou’s arms. Thinking of the blasted church, she couldn’t help but grip the shirt in front of Gu Zhou tightly and say, “Mr. Chen…” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he was slightly stunned. He looked down at Qiao Nian’s head in disbelief. Realizing that she was still crying, he couldn’t believe what he had heard. “Mr. Chen? Are you talking about the secretary of MY’s HH Corporation, Mr. Chen?”

Qiao Nian had been crying hysterically in Gu Zhou’s arms, but when she heard Gu Zhou’s words, she slowly stopped crying.

She looked up from Gu Zhou’s arms.

MY.

These two words were like a bomb, burning her to the core.

Only then did she realize that she had been dreaming about Mr. Chen being blown up in the church. She looked into Gu Zhou’s worried eyes and gradually calmed down.

Qiao Nian took a deep breath. So everything just now had been a dream.

Why did she feel that the dream was especially real?

She could feel Mr. Chen’s protectiveness, his love for her, and his heart-wrenching pain.

Was this a dream?

Why did a dream make her feel so real?

It was as if she had experienced it before.

“You just had a nightmare. Don’t be afraid. It’ll be fine.” As Gu Zhou spoke, he patted Qiao Nian’s back gently and comforted her.

Qiao Nian nodded, feeling very surprised.

She had clearly never interacted much with Mr. Chen. Why would she dream of him?

Qiao Nian burrowed back into Gu Zhou’s arms and reached out to hug him. Listening to Gu Zhou’s strong heartbeat, the nightmare just now gradually dissipated like a thick fog blown away by the wind.

Even so, she was still very sad.
