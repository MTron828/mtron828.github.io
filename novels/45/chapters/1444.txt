“Yes.” Qiao Nian smiled and looked around. She continued, “The air quality is getting worse and worse around the high-rise buildings in the city. The mountains are better.”

“My father often takes my mother to the temple on the mountain to pray to Buddha for her health to recover soon.” Lina looked at the temple hidden in the clouds not far away from the mountain and said softly, “My father often says that the temple is very effective. Why don’t we pay our respects later?”

“Okay,” Qiao Nian replied with a smile. From Lina’s words, she could sense that the President of Europe really cared about his wife.

From the pavilion, she looked at the temple at the top of the mountain. The temple looked solemn, as if there were really gods and Buddhas inside.

Lina narrowed her eyes and said softly, “My father specially built this temple for my mother. He once said that a temple built on the ground is not as good as a temple built at the top of the mountain because the temple at the top represents one’s sincerity and determination to communicate with the gods and Buddhas.”

When Qiao Nian heard Lina’s words, she could sense the sincerity in her words and the president’s love for his Madam.

Qiao Nian’s voice softened. She said seriously, “Don’t worry, I’ll definitely do my best to treat your mother!”

When Lina heard Qiao Nian’s words, her eyes paused for a moment, then darkened.

She knew that Qiao Nian really wanted to help her, but her father didn’t believe her at all. She felt a little sad.

How could she make her father agree to let Qiao Nian treat her mother’s illness? Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Lina’s frown deepened.

At this moment, gunshots came from afar.

Qiao Nian immediately stood up and looked over warily.

Lina frowned and said warily, “Someone actually dared to assassinate us!”

As the seventh princess of Europe, Lina had once undergone training related to assassinations. She took a deep breath and tried hard to remain calm.

At this critical moment, if she panicked, she might fall into the other party’s trap.

Lina turned to look at Qiao Nian and said seriously, “Nian Nian, don’t worry. I’ll definitely protect you well.”

When Qiao Nian heard Lina’s words, she was about to speak when she vaguely felt a sense of oppression coming from ahead. She looked up and saw a cold light shining at Lina.

The assassin was targeting Lina.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian pulled Lina to her side. As she was standing with Lina, Chen Qing and David, who were not far away, didn’t have time to run over to protect Lina.

Lina had just stabilized herself when she saw a bullet shoot into the pillar of the pavilion. Her expression changed slightly.

If Qiao Nian hadn’t pulled her away in time, the bullet might have pierced through her body.

At the thought of this, Lina’s legs went weak, and her face turned pale.

It seemed that there was a traitor in the presidential palace.

Her visit to Bear Mountain had only been decided last night, but those people had already set up an ambush.

Lina swallowed nervously and grabbed Qiao Nian’s hand. Her voice trembled as she said, “Nian Nian, let’s leave quickly!”

Chen Qing had been counting on David to contact the people in the presidential palace by radio, but David’s leg had already been injured and he had fallen to the ground. His radio had also shattered into countless pieces on the stones.

“Madam and Seventh Princess, the situation is urgent now. Let’s hurry back the way we came,” Chen Qing hurriedly said. Holding a pistol in one hand, he took out his phone with the other, preparing to contact Gu Zhou. However, there was no signal on the phone. This meant that those people had long cut off the signal!

Chen Qing knew that there were still many of their people at the foot of the mountain. If they heard the commotion, they would definitely come and help.

As soon as Chen Qing finished speaking, a few more bullets hit the pillars of the pavilion. Fortunately, Qiao Nian had already pulled Lina behind a stone.

Lina was so frightened that her hands turned cold, and her arms were still trembling. “Nian Nian!”

“It’s fine. Don’t worry!” As Qiao Nian spoke, she picked up a stone from the ground and threw it in the direction of the bullet without hesitation!

“Ah!”

A terrified scream came from the person hiding in the grass.
