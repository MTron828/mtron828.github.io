Chapter 468: Keeping a Promise

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Without even looking at Gu Zhou, Jiang Chi turned around and walked in.

Jiang Wen pulled the dagger from his knee. His forehead was covered in sweat. He threw the dagger to the ground and limped in after Jiang Chi.

Chen Shi, who was standing at the side, looked at Jiang Chi’s departing figure worriedly. He couldn’t help but ask, “Will they change their minds after they go in and not let go of Ms. Qiao, Mrs. Gu, and Eldest Young Master?”

When Chen Shi found out about Qiao Nian’s other identity, he couldn’t help but sigh.

No wonder Gu Zhou had invited Third Young Master over to protect Qiao Nian. It turned out that Qiao Nian was the Second Young Madam of the Gu family. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

He had been too unaware.

At this moment, Chen Qing also looked at Gu Zhou, feeling a little uneasy.

One had to know that Jiang Chi had a strong personality and had always been arrogant. How could he let her go so easily?

Gu Zhou looked at Jiang Chi’s departing figure and said without hesitation, “He won’t!”

It was impossible for so many people to follow him, nor was it possible for him to obtain his current identity and status if he didn’t keep his word.

In the room.

When Qiao Nian found out that Jiang Chi was willing to let them leave, she heaved a sigh of relief. However, when she realized that Lu Zhu’s breathing was getting softer and softer, she couldn’t help but feel her heart skip a beat.

Lu Zhu had lost too much blood and needed immediate treatment. Otherwise, he might not be able to see the sun tomorrow.

Qiao Nian carefully helped Lu Zhu out. Worried about his health, she walked very slowly. Even so, Lu Zhu’s face turned paler and paler, as if he couldn’t take it anymore.

When she reached the entrance of the side hall, she saw Jiang Chi standing there alone, his blue eyes fixed on her.

Qiao Nian looked calmly at Jiang Chi.

Jiang Chi glanced at Lu Zhu with killing intent, but quickly retracted it.

Then, his gaze landed on Qiao Nian’s face. His voice was a little hoarse as he threatened, “Qiao Nian, you’d better remember what you promised me previously. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being rude!”

Qiao Nian nodded solemnly and said, “Don’t worry, I’ll definitely give you a satisfactory answer!”

Jiang Chi glanced at Qiao Nian with a complicated expression before walking towards the main hall.

Qiao Nian shifted her gaze away from Jiang Chi’s face and helped Lu Zhu out.

When Qiao Nian reached the entrance of the Ghost City, she was slightly stunned to see so many tanks in front of her.

What was going on?

Gu Zhou’s identity seemed very mysterious.

The people around Gu Zhou could form an army.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou curiously.

Gu Zhou’s gaze also landed on Qiao Nian’s face. Their eyes met.

When Gu Zhou realized that Lu Zhu’s white shirt was dyed red with his blood, he jumped down and walked towards Qiao Nian.

Chen Shi was the first to run to Lu Zhu’s side. His eyes were filled with heartache as he asked with a trembling voice, “Eldest Young Master, how are you? Can you hear me?”

At this moment, Lu Zhu’s consciousness was already starting to fade. His body was burning hot, and he no longer had the strength to answer any questions.

When Lu Zhu saw Gu Zhou, his eyes gradually closed and he lost consciousness.

“We have to send him to the hospital quickly. He’s lost too much blood now. He needs a blood transfusion in time!” Qiao Nian hurriedly instructed.

“Oh, right, okay!” Chen Shi was already panicking. Of course, he would do whatever Qiao Nian said.

Chen Shi carefully took Lu Zhu from Qiao Nian’s hands and helped him into the car.

Just as Qiao Nian was about to get in, her hand was suddenly grabbed.

Feeling the warmth of his hand, Qiao Nian’s uneasiness gradually calmed down. She turned around and saw that it was Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou was wearing a black trench coat. As the night breeze blew, his clothes fluttered in the wind, and he looked a little tired from traveling.

Gu Zhou exuded a cold aura. However, when he approached Qiao Nian, all the coldness in his body disappeared, leaving only a warm and comfortable aura.

Gu Zhou let go of Qiao Nian’s wrist and naturally held her hand. Sensing the coldness of her hand, he looked at her with heartache. “I’m sorry.”

Qiao Nian looked into Gu Zhou’s deep eyes, which were filled with joy. She held his hand.

“I was late!” Gu Zhou said.
