Chapter 312: Scolding

“Can you be forgiven just because you posted photos?” Qiao Nian retorted, her voice as cold as ice. “What’s the difference? Moreover, I’ve already given you two chances. As long as you apologize and admit your mistakes, I won’t pursue the matter further. But what about you?”

Qiao Nian paused for a moment, then shook her head gently and said, “You continue to slander me. You have no intention of repenting.”

Qiao Nian’s words instantly angered everyone present. Many girls began to scold them.

“In my opinion, there’s no need to give such people a chance. If it were me, I would definitely ruin their reputations. They won’t be able to face anyone for the rest of their lives. To make an issue out of their innocence is simply too vicious!”

“You’ve done such a vicious thing, yet you’re blaming others for trying to clear your name. How can there be such a thing in this world? Qiao Nian is also a young girl. If you label her as a dirty girl, how will she find a job in the future? How will she get married and have children? You tried to impersonate her as the female musician, yet you still want to kill her. You’re the vicious ones!”

“That’s right, that’s right. If Qiao Nian didn’t have the ability to clarify this matter, she would probably have met a tragic end. Who would pity her?”

“You’re making things up because you’re kind, and she’s clearly evil. How dare you bully her like this? Why can’t she resist just because she’s being bullied?”

“We’re all girls. Everyone knows that purity is so important in this society!”

“Pfft, are you even worthy of being girls? All of you have such messy private lives. You look obedient, but I didn’t expect you to be rotten to the core!” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

…

The overwhelming curses made Xia Xue break down. She screamed loudly.

Gao Lin felt very innocent. She had only wanted Xia Xue to become Mr. Dong Hua’s female musician. She had never expected the photos Xia Xue and Liu Yu had given her to be theirs.

What made Gao Lin most speechless was that the two of them had actually taken a video after doing such a despicable thing. What kind of fetish was this!

When the two of them took those photos, she really thought that the person in the photos was Qiao Nian!

She had been tricked!

She had really been deceived!

Even if she told Qiao Nian the truth now and told her that she wasn’t involved in this matter, Qiao Nian probably wouldn’t believe her. Her reputation would still be ruined.

Gao Lin couldn’t take it anymore and fainted.

Liu Yu cried in agony. She didn’t know if she still had a future.

Qiao Nian looked at the time on her phone. When the time was up, she immediately deleted the Weibo post.

However, she believed that many people had probably saved the video she had posted. Some people would even take screenshots of them. The marketing accounts would definitely take advantage of the traffic. This matter would continue to be trending until something else that could shake the world happened. Only then would everyone forget about it.

Qiao Nian glanced at Xia Xue and Liu Yu. These two people didn’t deserve any sympathy. This was what they deserved.

Qiao Nian looked at Wang Xuan and said softly, “Alright, let’s go back!”

Wang Xuan glanced at the three of them, a disdainful smile appearing on her face. Only then did she leave with Qiao Nian.

She was already very shocked that Qiao Nian was Gu Zhou’s wife. Now that it was revealed that Qiao Nian was the principal of An University, Wang Xuan could not calm down for a long time.

Oh my god, so there really was such an outstanding person in this world.

Half an hour later, Xia Xue, Gao Lin, and Liu Yu were expelled from the school for causing damage to the school’s reputation and ruining its reputation. Moreover, the school would never work with these three people in the music industry.

When this announcement was made, everyone sighed.

The three of them would probably never be able to walk the path of music again.

Some people felt that it was a pity, while others applauded. The three malignant tumors had finally left.

After Qiao Nian dealt with the three shameless people, she felt much happier.
