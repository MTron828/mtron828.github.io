Chapter 1762 - 1762 Chatting?

He had finally taken the bait.

“Exterminated? What’s going on?” Chen Sheng looked at Sha He in confusion and said with uncertainty, “But I heard previously that the businessmen from Europe who bought jade were different from what you said. They said that there was a commotion in Europe. Someone called General Cui was killed in court by a third princess. Perhaps the General Cui you mentioned isn’t a general!”

Seeing that Chen Sheng really did not understand what was going on in Europe, Sha He explained, “You should be talking about Old General Cui Si’s only living son, Cui Qi.”

Sha He sounded a little unhappy when he said this, as if he looked down on Cui Qi.

In Sha He’s heart, Cui Qi was only conferred the title of general by the president because he had a father who was a general and was an orphan. Such a person was not worthy of being a general at all.

A trace of surprise flashed across Chen Sheng’s eyes as he said, “You don’t seem to like him?”

Sha He usually said whatever he wanted. Seeing that Chen Sheng had taken the initiative to talk to him, he excitedly told him about the rise and fall of the Cui family.

Sha He really finished speaking in one breath, highlighting General Cui Si’s persecution of the current president of Europe.

Although Chen Sheng knew more about the Cui family, he listened patiently at this moment. After all, he was going to put on an act with Sha He and take the opportunity to express his position.

“I really didn’t expect the European President to use such a despicable method. You have to know that without the help of Old General Cui, he wouldn’t have had a chance to sit in the president’s seat at all. How could he kick someone to the curb when they’ve outlived their usefulness? Poor Old General Cui is gone just like that. Now, Old General Cui’s only child is gone too. Sigh.”

Sha He nodded in agreement. “That’s right. I think so too. It’s fine as long as the president takes back his military power. How can he bite the hand that feeds him? He’s simply an ingrate.”

Chen Sheng drank his wine slowly, and the figure of the person who walked out of the door was reflected in the cup. However, he still looked calm and continued, “In history, there have indeed been many emperors who attacked the founding heroes. It’s just that the current president of Europe has gone a little too far. There’s no need to be so ruthless. Sigh, the Cui family…”

He sighed and stopped talking.

At this moment, a cold voice came from the side.

“When did you become so concerned about the matters in Europe?”

There was a hint of anger in his voice and this scared the three people in the living room. The three of them immediately put down the things in their hands and looked back. They saw Cui Huai standing at the door coldly.

The three of them called out respectfully, “Boss!”

Sha He was originally very relaxed, but when he noticed Cui Huai’s gloomy face, he could not help but feel nervous. He saw that Cui Huai was staring at the calm Chen Sheng and quickly said, “Boss, actually, I was the one who talked to him about this.”

Cui Huai stood with his hands behind his back. His gaze was always on Chen Sheng’s face. His eyes were filled with scrutiny, imperceptibly giving Chen Sheng all the pressure.

Standing at the side, Sha He’s mind was filled with confusion. He thought about what he had just said carefully. There was nothing wrong with it. Could it be that his Boss did not want the three of them to talk, or did he not want to see the three of them have a good relationship?Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Sha He’s frown deepened. At this moment, he saw Cui Huai looking over and quickly stood up straight.

Cui Huai raised his hand and patted Sha He’s shoulder. There was a hint of helplessness in his tone. “Sha He, you’re still too naive. You’re most suitable to do missions. You can’t do things that involve using your brain.”

Sha He frowned slightly and looked at Cui Huai in confusion.

Although his boss seemed to imply that he said something wrong again, he still did not understand what he had said wrong.

Just as he was about to apologize, he heard Boss say, “Chen Sheng has ulterior motives in every word he says. For example, when you mentioned Cui Si today, he was also the one who hinted at you to take the initiative to mention it.”

When he heard Cui Huai’s words, Sha He blinked in confusion and looked at Chen Sheng beside him in confusion, as if he was still thinking about what Cui Huai had said.
