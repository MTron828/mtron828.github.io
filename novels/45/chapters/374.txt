Chapter 375: Let bygones be bygones

Song Yu pursed her red lips. If this had happened five or six years ago, she might have been flustered, afraid, and at a loss. However, she had been in the entertainment industry for so long that she had long been able to withstand pressure.

Song Yu faced everyone very calmly. Then, she bowed deeply to everyone with an apologetic expression. After standing up straight, she said, “Today, I want to explain to everyone that I actually didn’t know that this work was a fake. The main reason was that this work was given to me by an old senior, so I never doubted the authenticity of this work, nor did I bring it to the institution for identification.”

Song Yu paused for a moment and continued, “Other than Miss Huang Shi herself, who can identify the authenticity of this work, I believe that even a professional appraisal agency might not be able to identify the authenticity of this work. I think my senior might not know that this is a fake.”

Song Yu’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face, her expression sincere. “Miss Qiao, although I can’t verify the authenticity of this work, it can’t be the reason why I made you suffer such slander just now. I misunderstood you just now. I was in the wrong too. I’m really sorry!”

With that, Song Yu bowed to Qiao Nian.

Song Yu’s voice was very sincere. Her beautiful eyes were filled with sincerity. The corners of her eyes were round, giving off a very comfortable feeling. No one could hate her.

Qiao Nian wasn’t an unreasonable person. Song Yu’s apology just now was also very sincere. She didn’t choose to run away just because Qiao Nian was a public figure.

Qiao Nian was naturally willing to do Song Yu a favor.

“Miss Song, you’re being too serious. Since the misunderstanding has been cleared up, there’s nothing else. I won’t pursue the matter further.”

When everyone heard Qiao Nian’s words, they all sighed with emotion.

“Miss Huang Shi is indeed someone who can draw stone walls. She’s truly magnanimous. Ordinary people can’t compare to her talent and upbringing!”

“Yes, Miss Huang Shi looks to be in her twenties!”

“Miss Huang Shi will definitely get better and better in the future!”

......

…

When Song Yu heard Qiao Nian’s words, she froze for a moment. She quickly understood.

It was normal for a genius like Qiao Nian, who stood at the top, to be so cultured.

Her lips parted slightly. “Miss Qiao, thank you.”

This misunderstanding was completely resolved, and the two of them buried the hatchet.

Qiao Nian’s eyes turned slightly cold. She looked at Song Yu and asked, “Miss Song, can you please tell me who gave you the fake?” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Song Yu’s expression changed slightly. She had a bad feeling.

She couldn’t say anything about this person.

However, if she didn’t say anything now, the matter of her receiving the fake would be brought up again.

Many people present were fans of Miss Huang Shi. All of them were well-known people in society.

If she didn’t tell the truth, everyone in the hall would probably eat her up.

Everyone turned to look at Song Yu, all curious about who had made the fake.

Song Yu looked at Qiao Nian awkwardly and said, “Miss Qiao, this matter involves my integrity. I can’t betray him, but you’re the victim. It’s normal for you to want to look for him. The only thing I can say is that his surname is Xu.”

Song Yu did reveal who it was but not his full name.

However, Song Yu’s words were not offensive.

Qiao Nian narrowed her beautiful fox-like eyes. She looked at Song Yu like this. She now understood why Song Yu had become so popular in the entertainment industry.

Moreover, she also believed that Song Yu wouldn’t lie to her in public!

Qiao Nian nodded and said, “Okay.”

Qiao Nian’s words made the others speculate.
