802 Think About It

Qiao Nian narrowed her beautiful eyes and looked at Su Xue, signaling for her to continue. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

She felt that Su Xue would not lie this time. Su Xue would definitely hide some small details, but that was not important. She just had to find important clues. Then, she would be able to investigate the truth.

SoulSpirit City!

When the time came, she would investigate this place carefully.

!!

“After I gave birth to Qiao Yu, I often fell sick because I didn’t take good care of myself during my confinement period. That spring, Qiao Yu was in kindergarten, and I had a bad cold. I didn’t recover for three days. I was worried that I would spread the disease to Qiao Yu, so I wanted to return to my hometown to recuperate!”

Qiao Nian’s expression didn’t change, but her heart softened.

Spring.

She still remembered that Qin Chuan had helped her find information previously. It was indeed spring when she was kidnapped.

This meant that Su Xue wasn’t lying this time.

Qiao Nian listened to Su Xue continue without batting an eyelid.

“That morning, when I was about to go out to buy medicine, I opened the door of my house and saw you standing pitifully at my door. You had many external injuries, and there’s a wound on your forehead that’s still bleeding. You look like you just escaped death!”

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze. She must have been kidnapped back then, which was why she was injured.

However, it was unknown if she had escaped on her own or if someone else had sent her out.

“At that time, I was shocked. I thought you were a little beggar, but you stepped forward and hugged my leg, calling me Mom!” As Su Xue spoke, in order to make Qiao Nian believe that she wasn’t lying, she asked, “At that time, I even told you that I wasn’t your mother, but you thought I was your mother, but you didn’t believe me at all. You even thought that I was lying to you and that I didn’t intend to want you anymore! Think about it, is that true?”

When Qiao Nian heard Su Xue’s words, she frowned, trying hard to recall the past.

Seeing that Qiao Nian believed her, Su Xue hurriedly said, “At that time, we were beside a bamboo forest, and you were carrying a small school bag. Think about it carefully. Is that true?”

As soon as Su Xue finished speaking, some blurry memories flashed across Qiao Nian’s mind.

In a daze, she seemed to see herself standing in the bamboo forest with the young Su Xue.

In that case, Su Xue wasn’t lying to her back then.

However, she still had some doubts about Su Xue’s words.

Qiao Nian didn’t say anything. She just let Su Xue continue.

Su Xue sighed slightly, planning to portray herself as a kind person. She continued, “At that time, you were seriously injured. I didn’t want to adopt you at first, but if I hadn’t, you might have died. After some thought, I decided to accept you! Anyway, raising another child isn’t difficult for the Qiao family!”

When Qiao Nian heard Su Xue’s words, a cold smile flashed across her face. She questioned, “Are you that kind?”

When Su Xue heard Qiao Nian’s words, her heart jumped to her throat. She had a bad feeling about this.

For some reason, she felt that Qiao Nian seemed to be able to read her mind.

Could it be that Qiao Nian could read minds?

How was this possible?

It was probably just that Qiao Nian had sharp eyes.

Qiao Nian crossed her arms and glanced at Su Xue calmly. She asked, “You adopted me without any benefits? Is this still you?”

Su Xue knew that something was wrong.

Qiao Nian was too smart!

But at this moment, she refused to admit it. Qiao Nian had no evidence anyway.

Su Xue shook her head and said with a serious expression, “What benefits could there be? At that time, your body was covered in injuries, and you were carrying a small school bag. At that time, Qiao Yu was still young, and his health wasn’t good either. He often fell ill, so I thought that raising you could be considered a good deed for Qiao Yu. Moreover, at that time, I heard from others that if I found a child bride for my son, he would grow up safely. His life would be smooth-sailing, and there wouldn’t be any disasters!”

At this point, Su Xue’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. In order to convince Qiao Nian, she said seriously, “Ever since I adopted you, Qiao Yu’s health has really improved a lot!”
