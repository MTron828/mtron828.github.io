1515 Well Done

Chen Qing casually threw the stone in his hand to the side and said indifferently, “I’m fine.”

Qiao Nian smiled and nodded. “Well done.”

Qiao Nian glanced at the document, then her gaze fell on Annie’s face. Seeing that Annie was still looking smug, she poured cold water on her mercilessly. “Princess Annie, I haven’t finished speaking. It’s too early for you to be happy!”

When Annie heard Qiao Nian’s words, her expression changed slightly, but she quickly calmed down. She pursed her lips and raised her eyebrows slightly. “What do you mean by that? Didn’t you say that Teng Yang isn’t poisonous? Why are you changing your words now? I want to hear what other lies a liar like you can make up.”

There was no trace of a smile on Qiao Nian’s face. She looked at Annie coldly and questioned, “May I know what the crime of poisoning Madam President in Europe is?”

Annie frowned. She was frightened by Qiao Nian’s aura and almost bit her tongue. She said angrily, “What nonsense are you spouting again!”

The president looked at Qiao Nian in surprise, his heart burning with anxiety. “Miss Qiao, please elaborate!”

Qiao Nian had long sorted out the ins and outs of this matter. She looked at the president in front of her and said, “Teng Yang is indeed not poisonous, but the Teng Yang Flower contains poison. We’ve indeed found Teng Yang in the soil. If I’m not wrong, Miss Annie must have crushed the Teng Yang Flower into liquid beforehand and watered the soil. The poison of the Teng Yang Flower can make one hallucinate. If one is exposed to this poison often, it will make one mentally unstable.”

Qiao Nian handed the soil to Annie again. Seeing Annie duck back in panic, her eyes turned cold.

“If there’s nothing wrong with this soil, Princess Annie, why did you hide behind it?” Qiao Nian asked sharply.

“What nonsense are you spouting? I just feel disgusted by you. I just don’t want to stand with you!” Annie refused to admit defeat.

Qiao Nian smiled coldly and continued, “I think Princess Annie must have spent a lot of effort on this. When this soil isn’t watered, the poison of the Teng Yang Flower won’t show. Every time you water the Falling Autumn Grass, the poison of the Teng Yang Flower will spread. So it looks like Princess Annie knows a lot about herbs!”

Just now, when Qiao Nian saw the words Teng Yang, the doubts in her heart were resolved.

No wonder she had always felt that Madam President’s cerebral palsy should have been cured. Madam President shouldn’t have lost her mind.

So the culprit was the Teng Yang flower. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“I don’t know anything about Teng Yang flowers at all.” Annie gripped her skirt nervously and looked at the president in front of her impatiently. She said anxiously, “Uncle, are you going to let this woman slander me? All these years, I’ve often sent Aunt Falling Autumn Grass before her illness stabilized. If it weren’t for me, Aunt would have died long ago!”

The president stood rooted to the ground in silence.

He didn’t believe Annie. Then his face turned green with anger.

If what Qiao Nian said was true, then hadn’t he personally caused her Madam to fall ill and lose her mind all these years?

He loved his Madam the most, but he was the one who had personally ruined her!

Lina quickly walked to the president’s side and hurriedly supported him. She called out anxiously, “Dad, what’s wrong?”
