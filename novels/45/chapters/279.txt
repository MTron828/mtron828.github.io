Chapter 280: Brother Cao Is Here!

This familiar tone stunned everyone.

Everyone turned around and saw Brother Cao walking in with one hand on his waist.

“Oh my god!”

“It’s actually Brother Cao!”

When Brother Cao heard this, he almost slipped. He rolled his eyes at the man and asked, “Why didn’t I know that I was dead?”

When Brother Cao walked in, everyone saw a young and beautiful man following behind him.

The man was wearing a very ordinary white shirt and black suit pants. His head was slightly lowered. From the looks of it, he should be Brother Cao’s assistant.

However, because that man was too good-looking, everyone couldn’t help but take a few more glances.

When Qiao Nian saw the beautiful man, she was slightly stunned. She didn’t expect Mr. Dong Hua to be here as well.

Mr. Dong Hua looked at Qiao Nian with his phoenix-like eyes. When their eyes met, he tacitly looked away, as if he had never seen her before.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips slightly. Mr. Dong Hua had already arrived. There would be a good show to watch soon.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian carried her violin on her back.

Brother Cao led Mr. Dong Hua inside. The students made way for them.

One of the students in the crowd got to the point. “Brother Cao, has Mr. Dong Hua arrived?”

Brother Cao lowered his gaze slightly and glanced at the man behind him. Then, he pretended to sigh. “I’m afraid I’ll have to disappoint you. Am I, an outdated manager, no longer welcomed by everyone?”

“How can that be? Brother Cao is the most handsome man in the world!”

“That’s right. Brother Cao is so outstanding. How can he be outdated?”

“Brother Cao’s aesthetic taste is as unique as ever!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

…

When Brother Cao heard someone praising his aesthetic taste, his eyes instantly lit up. He looked at that person dotingly and said, “You have good taste. You know that this is what trendy looks like!”

Brother Cao’s words instantly caused everyone to scream.

Xia Xue stood there. She wasn’t as excited as the others. She felt vaguely uneasy. She didn’t know how much Brother Cao had heard.

She wondered if Brother Cao had heard Qiao Nian play the violin.

What was Brother Cao doing here?

Was he checking on her progress?

Or had Brother Cao already realized that she wasn’t the one who had played the violin that day?

Xia Xue’s mind was in a mess. She turned to look at Qiao Nian, who was standing calmly not far away.

Could it be that Brother Cao had already greeted Qiao Nian?

At the thought of this possibility, Xia Xue’s heart began to race uncontrollably, as if it was about to jump out of her throat.

Xia Xue had mixed feelings, but she still had to put on a gentle and sweet facade.

A bright smile appeared on Xia Xue’s face. She walked towards Brother Cao. “Brother Cao.”

After Xia Xue spoke, her gaze fell on the man behind Brother Cao. Since this man was Brother Cao’s assistant, she should have a good relationship with him. Hence, Xia Xue smiled at the man.

However, the man lowered his gaze at this moment and missed her greeting.

Xia Xue’s body stiffened, but it only lasted for a moment. She quickly regained her usual composure.

Seeing Xia Xue like this, Brother Cao recalled how Xia Xue had specially returned to the dormitory to change her clothes. He felt uncomfortable all over.

He didn’t like hypocritical women.

Brother Cao nodded and led Mr. Dong Hua to the front. He turned back to look at the people in the hall and frowned slightly. Puzzled, he asked, “Why are there suddenly so many people?”

Xia Xue knew that something was wrong. She was a little worried that Brother Cao would think that she had become Mr. Dong Hua’s musician, so he had deliberately invited everyone here to increase her popularity.

She hurriedly explained, “They all thought that you and Mr. Dong Hua would be coming today, so they came over to take a look at you. I was just persuading everyone to go back early to study.”
