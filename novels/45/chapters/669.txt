Chapter 670: Recognition

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

When Lu Nian heard Qiao Nian’s words, his heart ached slightly.

His hand trembled as he took Lu Zhu’s phone. His gaze landed on the photo, and his pupils instantly dilated.

It was really a DNA report.

Moreover, the appraisers were Qiao Nian and Lu Zhu.

If this DNA report had been done in An City, Lu Nian might have suspected that this was the DNA report between Lu Qi and his brother.

This DNA report was written very clearly. According to the values on it, it could be determined that Qiao Nian and Big Brother had the same parents. Not only that, Qiao Nian’s age and birthday were identical to Sugar’s.

Lu Nian’s hands trembled even more.

He casually threw the phone to Lu Zhu and looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief. Step by step, he walked towards Qiao Nian. “Sugar…”

How many times had he dreamed of playing the piano with Sugar?

Then, he dreamed of Sugar being dismembered and dying tragically.

If this was a dream, he would rather not wake up again for the rest of his life.

Qiao Nian looked at Lu Nian.

She had already acknowledged her family once. She thought that she would be very calm when she acknowledged Second Brother.

However, when she heard Second Brother call her name and saw his teary eyes, she was still very emotional. Her eyes couldn’t help but tear up.

Due to the kidnapping back then, she had already missed more than twenty years of interaction with her family.

More than twenty years might not sound long.

But that was more than 7,300 days!

Even counting from one to 7,300 would take a long time.

Although Qiao Nian felt that she was very unlucky, she was much luckier than the children who had been kidnapped by human traffickers.

Now that she had found someone who loved her and she was no longer alone.

“Second Brother,” Qiao Nian called out slowly, her voice choked with emotion.

Lu Nian’s heart trembled slightly. He stood rooted to the ground in a daze, not daring to move, worried that all of this was just a dream.

Lu Nian recalled Sugar’s childhood. He often brought Sugar to the piano room. At that time, Sugar would always stay by his side obediently and listen to him play the piano.

His obedient and adorable Sugar had been kidnapped by the kidnappers.

When he first heard the news, he was on the verge of breaking down.

Whenever he was in unbearable pain, he would go to the piano room and sit there for the entire day, recalling every detail of his time with Sugar.

As time passed, he remembered that Sugar liked to listen to him play the piano, so he had been learning to write songs himself. Sugar would more or less appear in every song.

At that time, he thought that even though Sugar’s body was gone, Sugar’s voice and smile had always been in his music and his heart.

Later on, every time he went to the piano room, although he did not have Sugar’s company, he would always place a little bear not far away.

That little bear was Sugar’s favorite toy.

In his opinion, the little bear represented everything Sugar was.

Now that he heard his brother say that Qiao Nian was Sugar, the longing he had been suppressing in his heart burst out like a flood. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

He still remembered Sugar’s soft and cuddly appearance, but in the blink of an eye, Sugar had become a young girl.

With a bright smile on her face, she looked at him happily.

She would even call him “Second Brother” sweetly.

This feeling was very strange. It was indescribable.

Lu Nian took a step forward carefully, his breathing involuntarily lightening. Afraid that he would break this dream, he stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian. His gaze became even gentler, so gentle that water could drip from it.

“Sugar.”

Lu Nian’s voice was a little hoarse and teary. There were too many emotions in it.

Sugar, whom he had missed day and night, had returned.

Lu Nian saw that Sugar’s eyes were red. He said gently, “Sugar, don’t cry!”

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Nian’s words, she felt a lump in her throat. Without hesitation, she rushed into Lu Nian’s arms and hugged him tightly.

Second Brother!

This was the first brother she had acknowledged.

Lu Nian couldn’t help but take a step back, then stabilized himself.

His body was a little stiff, and the tip of his nose was filled with Qiao Nian’s light fragrance. That fragrance filled his entire world.
