1157 Son-in-law

Ever since the two of them made things clear to each other, they had been living together and had never been apart.

She saw Gu Zhou’s slightly dissatisfied gaze and said to the servants, “Please prepare a guest room for my son-in-law.”

Son-in-law?

The dissatisfaction in Gu Zhou’s heart instantly disappeared. He smiled at Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian smiled at Gu Zhou before retracting her gaze. She followed Su Yan and Lu Qi upstairs.

Su Yan walked to the corner of the stairs. She seemed to have thought of something and turned to look at her useless sons. “You’re not allowed to go back. Wait for me here!”

Lu Rao raised his eyebrows at Lu Zhu and whispered into his ear, “Look, I’m right. Our Mom won’t let us off so easily!”

Lu You walked up to Gu Zhou. Although he was not very satisfied with Gu Zhou as his son-in-law, Sugar liked him. As her father, he could not say anything else. He said in a low voice, “I’ll take you to the guest room to rest!”

Gu Zhou nodded. He could tell that his father-in-law wanted to have a good talk with his son-in-law.

Gu Zhou followed Lu You upstairs.

Su Yan sent Qiao Nian to Lu Qi’s room and held her hand reluctantly. Everything that had happened today seemed like a dream. She was really afraid. When she woke up tomorrow morning, Sugar would no longer be around. This was all a dream.

“Mom, it’s getting late. You should rest early too,” Qiao Nian said gently.

Su Yan nodded with slightly red eyes and said gently, “Yes, I understand. Rest early too.”

With that, Su Yan moved closer to Qiao Nian and planted a light kiss on her forehead. The love in her eyes was about to overflow. “Goodnight, baby.”

When Qiao Nian heard Su Yan’s words, her heart skipped a beat.

When she was young, she was especially envious of other children, because those children all had goodnight kisses. However, she lived in Shen Hao’s house and was scolded to return to her room every day. She had to turn off the lights early so that she wouldn’t waste money on electricity.

That was great. She had a goodnight kiss too.

“Goodnight, Mom.” Qiao Nian’s ears were slightly red, and she was a little shy.

Seeing Qiao Nian and Lu Qi enter the room, Su Yan helped the sisters close the door.

Qiao Nian stood in the room and watched as Su Yan gradually disappeared behind the door. She had mixed feelings.

So it felt good to be doted on by her mother.

Lu Qi looked at Qiao Nian’s reluctant gaze and took her hand with a smile. She said happily, “Sister, I’ve prepared six pajamas for you previously. I thought that when the two of us live together, we could whisper in bed. Come quickly and see which one you want to wear.”

“Yeah.”

“Alright, Sister, take a shower first. I’ll make the bed!” As Lu Qi spoke, she found a new set of washed underwear and said, “Sister, I bought this for you too. It’s already been washed. You can wear it!”

Qiao Nian smiled and nodded, taking the underwear. “Okay.”

Su Yan walked to the corner of the stairs and saw her four sons chatting enthusiastically. Song Yu was listening to them seriously. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

A trace of surprise flashed in her eyes. She always thought that her sons didn’t like to talk, but with Sugar back, they had become different from before.

Su Yan’s lips curved up slightly, but she thought about how her sons had long known that Sugar was still alive and had been hiding it from her and Lu You.

Su Yan walked down the stairs step by step, exuding a cold aura.

When everyone in the living room heard footsteps, they looked up in unison and saw Su Yan walking down. They immediately fell silent.

When Su Yan walked to the living room, Song Yu smiled and walked to Su Yan’s side. She reached out and held Su Yan’s arm. She said happily, “Mom, Sister is back. Should we think about how to hold a welcome ceremony for Sister tomorrow?”
