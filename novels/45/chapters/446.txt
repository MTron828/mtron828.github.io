Chapter 447: Interrogation

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Lu Zhu’s gaze instantly turned cold. He clenched his fists tightly. Without thinking, he knew that these people were definitely here for the Moon Goddess.

MY was a country where guns could be carried at will.

Lu Zhu knew that Qiao Nian was a stubborn person. Faced with those people, it was very likely that something would happen.

At this moment, Lu Zhu only had one thought in his mind, and that was to save her.

Lu Zhu walked back into the elevator.

At this moment, in the room.

Qiao Nian’s back was covered in sweat. She followed the man obediently, not daring to move recklessly.

If she had been further away from the gun, she was completely confident that she could have dodged the shot. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

However, the two of them were too close to each other now. In addition, the room was relatively small. As long as the other party fired, she would definitely die.

Qiao Nian glanced at the four of them. If she wasn’t wrong, the person pointing a gun at her should be the leader of these people.

“Find it!”

The man ordered coldly, and the three of them started searching everywhere.

The originally clean and tidy room was instantly in chaos.

......

Qiao Nian stood there quietly, letting them search.

Could they be looking for the moon goddess?

Even though the three of them had searched the entire room, they did not find what they wanted. Hence, they shook their heads at their leader.

There was a scar on the leader’s face. The scar ran from the corner of his left eye to the right corner of his mouth, directly through his entire face.

The leader questioned angrily, “Where’s the Moon Goddess?”

Qiao Nian knew that these people must be looking for the Moon Goddess.

When the man didn’t get a reply from Qiao Nian, he pointed the gun at her forehead with more force. Qiao Nian’s forehead turned red.

“I’ll ask you again. Where is the Moon Goddess? If you dare to play any tricks on me, I’ll send you to hell!”

Qiao Nian frowned in pain, but she didn’t make a sound.

Qiao Nian’s mind raced. In this situation, she could only save herself.

She knew in her heart that these four people were definitely not ordinary mercenaries. All of them were ruthless and had probably killed hundreds of people.

If she did as they said and handed over the Moon Goddess now, they would definitely kill her.

If she didn’t hand over the Moon Goddess now, she would definitely suffer a lot. However, she still had a chance to survive.

Seeing that Qiao Nian was silent, the leader seemed to understand what she was thinking. He said impatiently, “Damn woman, I advise you not to play any tricks. My patience is limited. If you give me the Moon Goddess now, I’ll consider letting you live. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being rude!”

Consider letting her live?

These words made Qiao Nian believe even more that this man had never thought of letting her live.

From the moment the four of them had entered the room until now, Qiao Nian had been acting very afraid. She knew very well that this was the only way to lower their guard.

Qiao Nian’s lips trembled slightly as she stammered, “The—the Moon Goddess isn’t with me!”

“If you say another word of nonsense, I’ll send you to hell. You won this competition and took the Moon Goddess. How can it not be with you?!” the leader said impatiently.

From this person’s words, Qiao Nian could tell that these four people had been instructed by someone to snatch the Moon Goddess. Moreover, she was very sure that the mastermind had also participated in this stone gambling competition. In order to avoid a commotion, Mr. Chen had not announced the exact situation to the public, let alone who the champion was!

Every event had its rules. Even if it would be announced soon, it wouldn’t be now.

Therefore, the person who knew that she had the Moon Goddess was definitely at the scene.
