1023 Using someone else to do the dirty work

Auntie Cao hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to be so bold. No wonder Qiao Nian hadn’t been angry at all just now. It seemed that she wanted to use her mouth to shut everyone in the Lu family up.

Using someone else to do the dirty work.

She took a deep breath. Matriarch Lu wouldn’t believe anything she said now. She could only wait for Madam to return and let her expose Qiao Nian’s disguise.

Auntie Cao suppressed her anger. Her status in the Lu family was second only to Matriarch, Master, and Madam. Now, she was actually being ordered around by Qiao Nian, this little girl, with such arrogance.

“I understand. I’ll make things clear to them,” Auntie Cao said reluctantly, lowering her head slightly.

“Okay,” Qiao Nian replied, then smiled at Matriarch Lu.

When Matriarch Lu saw the smile on Qiao Nian’s face, she immediately walked up to her and grabbed her hand, looking at her with teary eyes.

This was great!

God must have heard her prayer. That was why he had allowed her eldest granddaughter to return!

Qiao Nian noticed that Matriarch Lu’s hands were trembling. She knew that Grandma was afraid. Smiling, she grabbed Matriarch Lu’s hand and greeted gently, “Grandma.”

Matriarch Lu held back her tears. Although she didn’t know what had happened more than twenty years ago, the only thing she was sure of was that Sugar was still alive.

“Okay!” Matriarch Lu couldn’t continue. She looked at Qiao Nian gently. “Auntie Cao, prepare glutinous rice balls. We’re eating glutinous rice balls today.”

Glutinous Balls represented a reunion!

Lu Nian smiled and continued, “Alright, I’ll go to the kitchen to help too. I will even specially cook for Sugar today. Sugar, you have to try my cooking later.”

Qiao Nian smiled gently. “Thank you, Second Brother!”

Lu Zhu: Second Brother is too scheming. He’s starting to please his sister now.

Lu Rao: Second Brother is too much! He didn’t even give me a chance to perform.

Lu Jiang: Second Brother is indeed an old fox!

Lu Qi: Yes, Second Brother is cooking again. Second Brother’s cooking is the best!

Song Yu stood rooted to the ground and looked at Lu Nian with a flushed face. She had always known that Second Brother’s cooking was delicious, but Second Brother rarely cooked. In the past, she and Lu Qi had begged Second Brother to cook, but Second Brother had rejected their request mercilessly.

It seemed that Second Brother really liked Qiao Nian!

“Alright, alright. Second Brother is too considerate.” After Matriarch Lu finished speaking, she glanced at the other children at the side and frowned. “You all knew that Sugar was coming back. How can you buy just this little firework? Why? Are you all so poor that you can’t eat?”

Lu Rao and Lu Qi looked at each other awkwardly.

When Lu Rao looked up at Matriarch Lu, there was a smile on his face. He said deliberately, “Grandma, that’s not what you said just now.”

“Use your brain. How can this be the same?” Matriarch Lu rolled her eyes at Lu Rao and said, “Hurry up and get the butler to buy more fireworks. In the past twenty years, the Lu family has never let off any fireworks. Then let’s make up for the past twenty years. Today, we’ll let off all the fireworks together and welcome Sugar home happily.”

Lu Rao’s thin lips curved up. “Alright, I’ll tell him now!”

Matriarch Lu looked at the remaining children and began to instruct them. “Hurry up and prepare to decorate our house. Put up red lanterns, and let red satin flutter. Put up the red words of joy.”

Lu Qi couldn’t react for a moment. When she came back to her senses, she recalled Grandma’s words and was a little confused.

The Lu family’s renovation was European-style. According to Grandma, they were going to decorate the house in a traditional Chinese-style. It felt a little strange when the Chinese and Western styles were combined.

“Alright, Grandma. I’ll get someone to prepare it now.” Song Yu smiled and was the first to agree.

“Alright, alright. Hurry up and go. I want to have a good chat with my Sugar.” Matriarch Lu sent everyone away and held Qiao Nian’s hand as she walked towards her room.

Qiao Nian followed Matriarch Lu. Feeling the warmth of Matriarch Lu’s palm, her lips curved up slightly.

“Sugar, you must have suffered a lot over the years!” Matriarch Lu looked at Qiao Nian worriedly and asked.
