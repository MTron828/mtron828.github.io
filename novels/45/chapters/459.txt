Beneath the cross was a coffin made of ice.

Qiao Nian followed Jiang Chi in. He stopped in front of the ice coffin.

Qiao Nian looked at Jiang Chi in confusion. Following his gaze, she saw a man lying in the coffin. That man’s face was identical to Jiang Chi’s.

However, that man’s face was snow-white and lifeless. He looked like he had been dead for many years.

He was beautiful. Beautiful as a picture.

He lay in the ice coffin like a sleeping beauty.

Jiang Chi held back the tears in his eyes and looked at the person in the coffin. He said softly, “He’s my younger brother, Jiang Cheng.”

Qiao Nian could tell that Jiang Chi’s voice was hoarse. Standing beside him, she could also feel the grief emanating from his body.

It was rumored that the Black Hell King was heartless. It seemed that the rumors could not be completely believed.

“Three years ago, Jiang Cheng followed your brother to An City, but I didn’t expect that this trip would be the last one. When I saw him again, I realized that all his bones and tendons were broken. He must have been tortured inhumanely before he died!”

Jiang Chi held back his tears and tilted his head to look at Qiao Nian with eyes filled with bloodlust and hatred. “Your brother caused my brother’s tragic death. It’s only fair that I let him go down to accompany my brother now!”

Qiao Nian met Jiang Chi’s eyes, which were filled with hatred. Her expression faltered slightly. It turned out that Jiang Chi had no intention of letting Lu Zhu live.

Qiao Nian’s heart jumped to her throat.

However, she could not believe that someone as gentle as Lu Zhu would be so ruthless to Jiang Cheng.

Could it be that Jiang Chi had misunderstood something?

At this thought, Qiao Nian paused.

She did not know why she trusted Lu Zhu unconditionally.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips slightly. She knew that she couldn’t say this out loud, because that would anger Jiang Chi and only make Jiang Chi kill Lu Zhu sooner.

Qiao Nian lowered her eyes slightly. After some thought, she instantly thought of a solution. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“If you’re not lying to me, I think my brother deserves to die too!”

When Jiang Chi heard Qiao Nian say this, he was slightly stunned. The hatred in his eyes gradually disappeared. He hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to say this.

If it were anyone else, they would definitely deny him without hesitation.

Jiang Chi’s expression returned to normal, and his heart seemed to soften a little. In fact, he had been waiting for Lu Zhu to die. As long as Lu Zhu came here, he would definitely let Lu Zhu stay in the praying room to accompany his brother and lie there forever.

It was too lonely for his brother to lie alone in the praying room.

Seeing that Jiang Chi’s mood had improved a little, unlike earlier when he couldn’t wait to kill Lu Zhu immediately, Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief and asked, “I want to see my brother. I want to ask why he wanted to kill your brother!”

Qiao Nian’s gaze landed on Jiang Cheng’s face, and her eyes darkened involuntarily.

She knew the pain of losing her family. She also wanted to help Lu Zhu and Jiang Chi resolve the misunderstanding.

Although Jiang Chi and Jiang Cheng looked identical, in her opinion, Jiang Cheng seemed to be more gentle.

Jiang Chi must have protected Jiang Cheng very well, which was why he looked so innocent.

“Do you believe in reincarnation?” As Qiao Nian spoke, she looked up at Jiang Chi.

Jiang Chi met Qiao Nian’s gaze and shook his head gently.

He was the ruler of the Ghost City. He had never believed in ghosts or gods, much less that there was reincarnation in this world.

Qiao Nian stared intently into Jiang Chi’s eyes, her beautiful foxy eyes narrowing slightly.

If Jiang Chi really didn’t believe in reincarnation, he wouldn’t have sent someone to snatch the Moon Goddess.
