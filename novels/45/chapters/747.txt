748 Dark Childhood

Gu Zhou was not born because his parents liked him. After he was born, he became a medicinal source. His world was dark.

Perhaps Gu Zhou had been unwilling to tell her Gu Qi’s identity in the past because he wanted to protect him. He did not believe that there was anyone else in this world who could protect Gu Qi.

He probably didn’t want Gu Qi to experience his previous pain and darkness again.

Gu Zhou might also think that she was just trying to get rid of her bad luck by marrying him. He might not think there was a need to tell her this.

Or perhaps, Gu Zhou did not want to argue with her.

If she were Gu Zhou, she might not be willing to say it either.

“His mother had a strong desire to control him. His schedule and three meals a day had to be arranged according to schedule. Once, his father brought him back to play. When he saw me taking medicine, he thought that I was eating candy. I still remember how he looked full of anticipation at that time.” At this point, Matriarch Gu’s voice choked again.

Gu Zhou looked at her round pills for a long time before asking softly.

“Grandma, is this candy?”

“Is the candy good?”

“What does it taste like?”

The more Matriarch Gu thought about it, the sadder she became. Silently, she wiped the tears from the corners of her eyes. “He had never eaten candy before. I wanted to get someone to buy him candy, but his mother was unhappy. He didn’t dare to eat it either. At that time, he was only five years old, but he had already learned to read people’s expressions.”

Qiao Nian recalled that day in the bathtub when Zhou Zhou had appeared. At that time, she couldn’t help but take the initiative to kiss Zhou Zhou. At that time, Zhou Zhou had even asked her if she had given him candy.

At that time, Zhou Zhou’s eyes were extremely clear.

She felt very sad.

At this moment, Gu Zhou pushed the door open and walked in, holding a document in his hand. When he saw Matriarch Gu, a trace of confusion flashed in his eyes.

He had not expected Matriarch Gu to be in the room.

Matriarch Gu was also stunned. She had not expected Gu Zhou to suddenly come over.

Qiao Nian stared unblinkingly at Matriarch Gu. It was really hard for her to imagine that Gu Zhou had such a cruel childhood.

She found it hard to imagine that Gu Zhou had such a tragic childhood in the past. How had he survived?

Gu Zhou noticed that Qiao Nian’s gaze was even gentler than before. A trace of confusion flashed in his eyes. Then, he looked at Matriarch Gu. “Grandma, why are you looking for Nian’er?”

When Qiao Nian heard the word “Nian’er”, her heart couldn’t help but race. She looked up at the man and was completely certain that the man standing in front of her was Gu Zhou, not Gu Chuan.

If it were Gu Chuan, he would definitely not speak so gently.

“It’s nothing.” Matriarch Gu knew that Gu Zhou was unwilling to let others know about his childhood. She stood up and said, “I just wanted to ask about Xiao Qi’s condition. Now that I’ve asked, I’ll leave too. You guys chat!”

Seeing this, Gu Zhou nodded. “Okay.”

Matriarch Gu also stood up and walked out.

Seeing that Matriarch Gu was about to leave, Qiao Nian stood up and walked her to the door. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

After Matriarch Gu left, she even closed the door of the room considerately.

Hence, Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou were the only ones left in the room.

Qiao Nian recalled Matriarch Gu’s words and understood Gu Zhou very well. The ill feelings in her heart disappeared.

However, she did not know what to say to Gu Zhou.

After a while, Gu Zhou said, “Didn’t you say that you wanted to rest just now?”

Gu Zhou’s voice was as calm as ever. There was no emotion in it.

Qiao Nian nodded and said, “Yes, I’m preparing to take a shower and rest.”

After she finished speaking, she saw that Gu Zhou was hesitating to speak. She glanced at the folder in Gu Zhou’s hand and asked, “Why are you looking for me…”

Gu Zhou had already thought of telling Qiao Nian that he and Gu Qi were father and son. However, at this moment, he hesitated again.

Seeing that Gu Zhou was deep in thought and was silent, Qiao Nian took the initiative to say, “If there’s nothing else, I’ll go take a shower first?”

She found out so much today that she wanted to slowly digest it.
