Chapter 171 Reprimand

At the thought of Gu Zhou’s health, Matriarch Gu’s expression became suffused with melancholy. She turned to look at Qiao Nian and urged, “Nian Nian, if he bullies you, don’t be afraid to let Grandma know. Grandma will definitely teach him a lesson for you!”

Qiao Nian’s heart warmed. Her eyes sparkled, bright laughter in her gaze. “Okay.” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Then, Matriarch Gu took Qiao Nian’s hand and began chatting about some interesting things with a smile.

Only then did Gu Zhou’s tense heart relax.

Once they arrived at the Gu family villa, Gu Zhou was worried that Matriarch Gu would ask him to go to the hospital for a physical examination again. Thus, he brought Chen Qing to the study.

Meanwhile, Qiao Nian stayed with Matriarch Gu in the living room, chatting.

Before long, Jiang Yue and Zhao Qian returned home as well.

The two of them greeted Matriarch Gu politely. Matriarch Gu’s mood had just lightened considerably, and she was beaming. However, when she glimpsed Jiang Yue, her smile instantly vanished. Her eyes gradually filled with anger. Jiang Yue knew Matriarch Gu well and could tell that she was angry. She quickly walked over and sat down beside Matriarch Gu, a fawning smile on her face. “Grandma, what would you like to eat tonight? I’ll make whatever dish you want for you right now.”

Zhao Qian walked over and sat down beside Qiao Nian. In a low voice, she greeted, “Second Sister-in-law.”

Qiao Nian greeted Zhao Qian with a faint smile. Because Matriarch Gu was angry, she was really worried that Matriarch Gu’s heart disease would flare up again. All her attention was on Matriarch Gu.

Matriarch Gu’s gaze fell on the servant who had just entered the room. Seeing the gown the servant was holding, she frowned and turned to look at Zhao Qian. In a manner that was still considerably gentle, she asked, “Qian Qian, did you tell Jiang Yue that the gown I made was for Nian Nian?”

Zhao Qian looked at Matriarch Gu and nodded. “Grandma, I did.”

When Jiang Yue heard Zhao Qian’s words, the blood drained from her face. She stammered an explanation. “Grandma, I thought Qian Qian was joking with me. I…”

Matriarch Gu’s expression improved a great deal. She heaved a sigh of relief. Ever since she had spoken to Zhao Qian, the child had shed her prejudice against Nian Nian.

Once again, Matriarch Gu’s gaze fell on Jiang Yue’s face. Seeing that her eyes had turned red, she said, “Get all the servants here!”

Within three minutes, all the servants in the Gu family villa were standing in the living room.

Matriarch Gu swept her gaze across everyone present. Intentionally or otherwise, her gaze lingered on Jiang Yue’s face for a while longer. Her eyes were filled with coldness, and her grave, stately aura frightened everyone so much that they did not dare to move.

“Today, I have something to say!” Matriarch Gu said as she stood up from the sofa.

Jiang Yue hurriedly went to help Matriarch Gu up, but was pushed away by Matriarch Gu. Jiang Yue’s expression faltered.

Qiao Nian helped Matriarch Gu walk towards the servants. Zhao Qian followed behind Qiao Nian like an obedient lamb.

“From now on, if any fool dares to slight Young Madam, don’t blame me for being impolite.” Matriarch Gu tried hard to suppress her anger. If she had not raised Jiang Yue herself, she would have chased her out of the house long ago.

Hearing Matriarch Gu’s words, Qiao Nian felt a strange disturbance in her heart. It was as if a stone had fallen into the still lake of her heart, causing ripples to bloom across the initially calm surface.

Qiao Nian knew very well that Grandma’s words were meant for Jiang Yue to hear.

Jiang Yue was no fool. She could naturally tell that Matriarch Gu was referring to her. Her eyes grew even redder, and her hands dug into her palms involuntarily. Her heart ached terribly.

In the past, everyone knew of Young Mistress Jiang Yue of the Gu family. Today, she had been thoroughly humiliated at the speech ceremony. Now that she had returned home, Grandma had even deliberately embarrassed her in front of so many people.

Jiang Yue’s mind was in a mess. She was a little worried that Grandma would take back everything she had.
