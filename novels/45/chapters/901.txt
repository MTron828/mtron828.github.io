902 Protecting Her?

Qiao Nian pursed her lips.

“But it already happened. At that time, he wanted to make it up to that girl.” Lu Zhu recalled Gu Zhou’s painful expression and couldn’t help but sigh. “His first reaction was to look for that girl, but An City is so big. Finding a girl is like fishing for a needle in the sea.”

“He doesn’t dare to look for that girl openly. With the Gu family’s status in An City, if Gu Zhou speaks up, many women will definitely flock to him. What happened that night will also be brought up by everyone. In order to protect that girl’s reputation, he could only secretly look for her.”

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Zhu’s words, she was stunned.

She finally understood why Gu Zhou had never been able to find her. It was because she had asked Qin Chuan to erase her traces, so Gu Zhou could not find her.

In order to protect what happened that night, Gu Zhou had hidden his identity, so she had never found him.

They all did the same thing again, and that was to protect her.

The discomfort in Qiao Nian’s heart dissipated a little, but her mind was still in a mess. She hurriedly suppressed the messy emotions in her heart and said, “Brother, don’t tell Gu Zhou about this. I want to handle it myself.”

Lu Zhu looked at Qiao Nian with heartache. Her eyes were red, and her nose was a little red. She looked aggrieved.

He stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian and asked, “Then have you thought of what to do?”

A trace of stiffness flashed across Qiao Nian’s face. Her eyes darkened as she sighed and said, “I don’t know.”

If she hadn’t fallen for Gu Zhou and if Gu Zhou wasn’t Brother White Shirt, she would have killed him without hesitation!

But it was different now.

She couldn’t do anything to Gu Zhou.

Qiao Nian sighed helplessly.

Fate really made fools of people!

Qiao Nian picked up the cup on the table and took another sip. Suddenly, an idea flashed across her mind. She hurriedly said, “Brother, I understand now why Mom was certain that the broken arm was mine back then.”

When Lu Zhu heard Qiao Nian’s words, he looked confused. “What do you mean?”

“If Mom uses the blood in that broken arm for a DNA paternity test, the results will definitely be mine, because the owner of that broken arm used my bone marrow. The blood in her body is the same as mine.”

Lu Zhu wasn’t a medical student, but he was very smart. He quickly understood what Qiao Nian meant.

Lu Zhu paused for a moment and continued, “You’re saying that person used your bone marrow.”

“Yes, that person had a bone marrow transplant.” Qiao Nian frowned. When she realized today that her encounter matched Gu Zhou’s, she knew that she was the mother of two children.

When Song Man’s blood DNA was tested with Xiao Shi’s, the two of them were biologically related.

This meant that Song Man’s blood DNA was the same as hers.

In other words, she had once done a bone marrow transplant for Song Man.

When Qiao Nian thought of Gu Qi and Xiao Shi, her heart instantly softened. Her heart was filled with joy and excitement.

Her eyes gradually turned red. She had thought that her children were already dead, but she had not expected them to be alive and well, and right beside her.

She was simply too happy.

Gu Qi had already called her Mommy. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

She did not like children to begin with.

That night at the crematorium, she only took one look at Gu Qi and fell in love with him. She was also willing to interact more with him.

Later on, when she saw Xiao Shi, she also felt that she was very close to her. She couldn’t help but like her.

Now, it seemed that it was because her blood flowed in the bodies of those two children. It was blood ties that had closed the distance between them.

Now that she thought about it, she was still very lucky to have a pair of children by her side.

Qiao Nian suppressed the joy in her heart. She felt that she had to discuss this matter with her brother. “Brother, I think you have to ask Mom if she only used blood when she did the DNA test with that broken arm. Did she use the skin of the broken arm?”

Lu Zhu wasn’t sure what the difference was. He asked, “What’s the difference?”
