Chapter 686: Kissed

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian was in a daze from the kiss. Her body went limp, and she couldn’t help but sink deeper.

She was completely submerged in the bathtub. Her vision was getting blurry, and she felt as if she was standing in the clouds. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Only when Qiao Nian was about to faint did Gu Zhou let go of her.

He licked his lips slightly, his eyes darkening.

It was the taste of strawberries. Sweet.

This was the first time he had eaten anything so sweet. Although the sweetness had faded a little towards the end, it was still much sweeter than what he had eaten before.

He looked down at Qiao Nian’s face. The person he had been yearning for day and night was right in front of him.

Qiao Nian lay in his arms. She couldn’t breathe just now, nor did she have any strength. She subconsciously looked at the man in front of her.

Neither of them moved to look at the other’s face.

Qiao Nian recalled what had happened just now. The heat had dyed her face red. Her eyes were slightly red as she narrowed her eyes at the man in front of her.

She suddenly recalled something. Previously, in Gu Qi’s room, she had seen a lot of candy on the table. She had casually picked up a strawberry candy and eaten it.

Qiao Nian realized that his eyes were as clear and pure as before. It was as if he didn’t know that kissing was wrong at all, nor did he realize that kissing was very ambiguous.

Qiao Nian knew that the person in front of her was still Zhou Zhou.

Although Zhou Zhou had forced a kiss on her, every time Qiao Nian looked into his eyes, she felt that she had shamelessly led a child astray. She felt a deep sense of guilt.

Her heart was beating faster and faster. She looked away guiltily, and her heartbeat gradually calmed down.

She was afraid that she would not be able to control herself and pounce on Zhou Zhou to eat him.

After a while, Qiao Nian pushed Zhou Zhou away and sat up. She walked out of the bathtub and said coldly, “Take a shower yourself!”

Qiao Nian really didn’t want to stay any longer. However, she had just taken a step when her hand was grabbed.

“What now?” Qiao Nian pretended to be impatient.

“Nian Nian, aren’t you going to bathe Zhou Zhou?”

The man’s innocent voice came from behind.

Qiao Nian suppressed the agitation in her heart. She felt that Gu Zhou was born to torture her.

Gu Zhou was calm and restrained. Zhou Zhou was innocent and childish, seducing her like a little white rabbit. Gu Chuan was domineering and paranoid, wanting to keep her by his side.

Either way, she couldn’t deal with it perfectly.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips. She was a little frustrated. Holding a towel, she absent-mindedly wiped Gu Zhou’s back.

If Gu Zhou remembered all of this, would he be very disgusted?

After all, she was the one who had led Zhou Zhou astray first.

Qiao Nian closed her eyes slightly. She hoped that Gu Zhou’s three personalities would fuse as soon as possible, but she was afraid that they would. She didn’t know what to do.

Qiao Nian was really no longer in the mood to deal with Zhou Zhou. She threw the towels into the bathtub, took out a towel, and wrapped herself in it. Then, she handed the other towel to Gu Zhou. “Wipe yourself clean, then go to bed!”

Zhou Zhou sat in the bathtub. He could sense the impatience in Qiao Nian’s tone.

He looked at Qiao Nian in fear and unease. With an innocent expression, he said pitifully, “Is Nian Nian angry?”

Qiao Nian didn’t reply.

He felt even more uneasy. He reached out and grabbed Qiao Nian’s hand, his eyes slightly red. “Are you angry with Zhou Zhou?”

Qiao Nian turned her back to him and remained silent. She wasn’t actually angry with him.

She was just angry with herself. The current Zhou Zhou was an innocent child, but she did not control herself and taint the innocent little cutie.

However, when she thought of how she had forcefully kissed Zhou Zhou previously, Qiao Nian swore that no matter how many times she did it again, she would still do it.

“Then Nian Nian can hit Zhou Zhou!” As he spoke, he grabbed Qiao Nian’s wrist with his left hand and hit his right palm.

Qiao Nian’s expression changed slightly. She turned back to look at him, her expression slightly stunned. Seeing his serious expression, the coldness on her face instantly collapsed. She hurriedly stopped him and smiled. “Zhou Zhou, you’ve misunderstood. I’m not angry with you.”

“Really?” He looked up at Qiao Nian and asked innocently.
