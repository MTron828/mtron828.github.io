Chapter 353: Taking Action

Qiao Nian’s expression was cold as she said, “Looks like there’s no room for you here. You don’t have to continue working here!”

When Lu Nian heard Qiao Nian’s words, his lips curved up imperceptibly. It seemed that the little fox was quite capable. She definitely wouldn’t bear to let herself suffer.

When Wang Hua heard Qiao Nian’s words, he couldn’t help but laugh. It was as if he had heard the funniest joke in the world. He said sarcastically, “You’re just a young girl who’s insensible. You don’t know the immensity of heaven and earth. How dare you come here and behave atrociously? Do you know who organized this charity banquet?”

Qiao Nian narrowed her beautiful fox-like eyes and crossed her arms. She said, “Of course I know who organized the auction. However, such a good auction ended up being blocked by a dog. I wonder if Mr. Qin will feel embarrassed when he finds out about this?”

Wang Hua glared at him. “Who are you scolding?”

“Dog!”

Wang Hua was furious. He raised his hand to hit Qiao Nian.

Lu Nian, who was standing at the side, subconsciously raised his hand to stop it.

However, before his hand could touch Wang Hua, he saw Wang Hua’s hand freeze in midair. Someone caught it.

Then, he heard the sound of bones dislocating.

Wang Hua screamed, startling the guests.

Qin Lu, who had just walked in, turned around when she heard the voice. She looked at Wang Hua in disbelief, her face pale with fear, as if she was the one whose hand had been broken.

Why would Gu Zhou help Qiao Nian?

Her goal here today was to seduce Gu Zhou.

…

Everyone looked over and saw Gu Zhou standing there with a cold expression. His entire body emitted a sinister aura, as if he were a demon from hell. It made one shiver.

Just as Wang Hua was about to curse, he turned around and saw Gu Zhou. His face instantly turned pale in fear, and he stammered, “Young… Young Master Gu…”

Gu Zhou’s phoenix-like eyes narrowed slightly, filled with dissatisfaction. He enunciated each word clearly. “You’ve damaged my doctor. Do you think you can treat my illness? Hmm?”

Gu Zhou’s last word was extremely domineering. He looked as if he wanted to eat Wang Hua alive.

For some reason, Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat. This was the first time she had seen Gu Zhou admit in public that he was sick and speak up for her.

“I…” Wang Hua was so nervous that his legs were trembling.

With a loud bang, Wang Hua was sent flying by Gu Zhou’s kick.

Gu Zhou looked at Wang Hua as if he was looking at trash. He despised him to the core!

After Gu Zhou was done, his gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. He said slowly, “Doctor Qiao, my brother didn’t ask you to linger at the door. He asked you to follow me. Otherwise, if I fall ill, who will treat me?”

Qiao Nian was speechless. Why is this person getting more and more comfortable with his words? Could it be that he was addicted to being sick?

The others were all stunned!

Chen Qing couldn’t help but smile.

Second Master’s possessiveness began to act up again.

When the three of them entered, Wang Hua, who was lying on the ground, regretted his actions greatly.

Qin Lu stood rooted to the ground in disbelief. She couldn’t believe what she was seeing.

She was right.

Qiao Nian was seducing men just because of her looks. She was simply shameless.

After some thought, Qin Lu’s gaze finally landed on Gu Zhou.

Everyone said that Gu Zhou would have a short life, but he was handsome. He would be an eye-catching figure even among men. If she could marry Gu Zhou, then after Gu Zhou died, all the Gu family’s assets would be hers. At that time, she could find a better man.

However, Qin Lu had never expected Qiao Nian to get there first. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

She had to think of a way to get Gu Zhou back.

At the thought of this, Qin Lu pursed his lips slightly. Her gaze inadvertently fell on Jiang Yue’s face, and she smiled as she took her hand.

Everyone knew that Jiang Yue was the eldest daughter of the Gu family and had grown up with Gu Zhou.

If she could build a good relationship with Jiang Yue, then Qiao Nian could only stand aside.
