741 Acknowledging one’s roots and ancestors

At the thought of Gu Qi’s obedient appearance, Matriarch Gu couldn’t help but mutter, “That child is really too smart. I didn’t notice this when I was taking care of him in the past. I think he’s even smarter than you were when you were young.”

When Gu Zhou heard Matriarch Gu’s words, he lowered his gaze slightly. He no longer wanted to recall his childhood, because other than pain and discomfort, there was nothing else.

“Gu Qi is a smart child. Our Gu family’s bloodline shouldn’t be left outside. If we hadn’t insisted on letting him out back then, he wouldn’t have had autism and wouldn’t have refused to communicate with us. Since he’s already returned home, shouldn’t we consider letting him acknowledge his ancestors?”

Gu Qi understood what Matriarch Gu meant. He pursed his lips and lowered his head in silence.

…

Qiao Nian returned to the bedroom. She looked at the document in her hand and immediately opened the seal.

She removed the file from the folder.

In the middle of the first page of the white document were the words “Paternity Test”.

Qiao Nian frowned slightly. She recalled how Jiang Yue had looked at her provocatively in the Lu family home. Her expression changed slightly.

No, at that time, Doctor Li had told her that the results of the appraisal were unrelated.

Then why had Jiang Yue given her another appraisal report?

Could it be that Jiang Yue knew that she had given birth before?

That shouldn’t be possible. Not many people knew about her incident.

Qiao Nian was filled with doubts. When she opened the first page of the document and her gaze fell on the second page, her expression changed.

She felt as if a bucket of ice water had been poured over her from head to toe. She was so cold that she could not move. She stood rooted to the ground in a daze.

The paternity test report in her hand fell to the ground.

How was this possible?

How could Gu Qi be Gu Zhou’s biological son?

She must have seen wrongly.

In the past, Gu Zhou had an aversion to women, and he had never been intimate with any woman. How could he have such a big son for no reason?

Qiao Nian’s heart was beating faster and faster. She could clearly hear her own heartbeat.

She recalled what Gu Zhou had told her about Gu Qi’s father. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Gu Qi’s father was sick and had been lying on the bed, so he did not have time to take care of Gu Qi.

Qiao Nian’s mind raced. Could Gu Zhou be referring to himself?

Gu Zhou was not in good health and did not have many years to live. This was common knowledge.

Not only that, although Gu Zhou’s expression was calm now, his health was not good either. He could collapse at any moment.

Could Gu Qi really be Gu Zhou’s child?

Qiao Nian frowned. Perhaps Jiang Yue was trying to sow discord between her and Gu Zhou.

At this moment, there was a knock on the door.

Qiao Nian came back to her senses. She hurriedly squatted down and stuffed the paternity test document back into the folder. Then, she stuffed the entire folder into her bag. She composed herself and pretended that nothing had happened.

When she was just ready, the door opened.

She looked up and saw Gu Zhou’s dark eyes looking at her.

Gu Zhou’s eyes were deep. With just one look, she could not help but be immersed in them.

Qiao Nian looked away and tried hard to compose herself. She gave a relaxed and happy smile and asked, “Why did Grandma call you over just now?”

Gu Zhou glanced at Qiao Nian with a complicated expression. Without a word, he unbuttoned his suit jacket and casually placed it on a hanger.

He tugged at his tie, loosening the first two buttons of his shirt collar. The shirt hung loose on him, making him look like a nobleman from a comic book.

“She asked about what happened at the Lu family today.”

Qiao Nian stared unblinkingly into Gu Zhou’s eyes. His gaze was sincere, and he didn’t look like he was lying.

At the thought of Gu Zhou and Gu Qi’s relationship, she frowned slightly.

She wasn’t sure if Gu Zhou was lying to her.

Her gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face. If Gu Zhou and Gu Qi were father and son, they should look alike.

She had never thought about Gu Zhou and Gu Qi’s looks in the past, but at this moment, she noticed that Gu Zhou looked 60% similar to Gu Qi.
