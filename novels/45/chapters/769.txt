“Sister Nian Nian, I’m here!” Lin Tao’s happy voice came through the phone.

“Wait for me at the door. I’ll go open the door.” With that, Qiao Nian walked out. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

At this moment, Gu Qi and Xiao He, who had been playing in the living room, stood up and followed Qiao Nian out.

When the three of them reached the entrance of the villa, Qiao Nian saw Lin Tao standing not far away.

To be honest, she really didn’t recognize Lin Tao.

Lin Tao walked up to Qiao Nian and spun around happily. “What do you think of my outfit?”

Qiao Nian’s lips twitched slightly.

What should she say?

Lin Tao’s outfit was so green that it was practically glowing. It was simply difficult to look at her directly.

Not only had she dyed her hair green, but she was also wearing a long green dress. Even her shoes were green.

If she hadn’t recognized Lin Tao’s face, she would have thought that a patient from the mental hospital had come out.

Patients in mental hospitals didn’t even have the chance to dye their hair like this.

Qiao Nian looked at Lin Tao worriedly and asked carefully, “Have you been agitated by something recently?”

Lin Tao smiled and tucked her hair behind her ear. “Actually, it’s nothing serious. I was just cuckolded!”

Qiao Nian looked at Lin Tao. She was completely different from before. She had clearly been severely traumatized. If Lin Tao walked on the streets like this, people might think that she was crazy!

Lin Tao didn’t seem to know what Qiao Nian was thinking. She complained, “Since he has the cheek to do such a despicable thing, I’ll let everyone know what kind of person he is!”

Qiao Nian began to doubt if she had done the right thing by calling Lin Tao over.

Forget it. She was just asking Lin Tao to take care of Gu Qi for a night. She would come over to pick Gu Qi up tomorrow.

“Then help me take good care of Gu Qi. Don’t bully him!” Qiao Nian couldn’t help but add.

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Lin Tao smiled and said casually, “Sister Nian Nian, I’m not a child. I’ll definitely take good care of him.”

Qiao Nian looked at Lin Tao suspiciously, but didn’t refute. She asked, “Do you want revenge?”

When Lin Tao heard Qiao Nian’s words, her eyes lit up.

“We’ll talk about your situation later. Remember to take good care of Xiao Qi for me.” As Qiao Nian spoke, her gaze fell on Gu Qi’s face. She saw that Gu Qi was already looking elsewhere coldly, as if he didn’t like Lin Tao. “Xiao Qi, this is Auntie Lin Tao. She’ll take care of you!”

When Lin Tao heard the word “auntie”, she frowned slightly and said unhappily, “I’m still young and inexperienced. Just call me Sister!”

Qiao Nian smiled and raised her eyebrows slightly. She asked, “Are you going to call me Auntie?”

Lin Tao’s expression froze for a moment. She pursed her lips and said reluctantly, “Alright, then call me Auntie!”

When he saw Lin Tao like this, a trace of worry flashed across his eyes. His gaze fell on Gu Qi’s face, and he looked conflicted.

Qiao Nian was still very relieved to hand Gu Qi over to Lin Tao. Although Lin Tao was a little careless sometimes, she was very meticulous. Nothing would happen.

Qiao Nian smiled at Xiao Shi and said, “Alright, let’s go. I’ll take you home now!”

Xiao Shi looked at Gu Qi reluctantly. After saying goodbye to him, she got into Qiao Nian’s car.

Lin Tao had already brought Gu Qi into the villa.

Xiao Shi sat in the front passenger seat and still looked at Gu Qi worriedly, as if she was very worried that Gu Qi would suffer.

Qiao Nian helped Xiao Shi fasten his seatbelt. Realizing that Xiao Shi was looking worried, she asked in confusion, “Xiao Shi, don’t you want to go to the Gu family now?”

Xiao Shi shook her head and said worriedly, “I want to see Dad, but I’m still worried that Brother Xiao Qi’s hair will turn green too!”

Green-haired Gu Qi…

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but shiver. This was simply too terrifying.

Moreover, Lin Tao was a young lady who did whatever she wanted. She had done everything.
