Chapter 1732 - 1732 Flirting

Mark only had one daughter, Annie. As he didn’t have a son, he adopted Wright and treated him as his own.

Now that Aisha had been locked up, in Wright’s opinion, only his son was the heir. Wright had always felt that he was Mark’s only heir.

That was why Wright had said fearlessly that Chen Qing would not dare to let him have no descendants. After all, Mark’s anger was not something ordinary people could withstand.

Of course, Chen Qing understood what Wright meant. He smiled and asked, “Are you biologically related to him?”

Wright’s expression froze.

“Annie is his biological daughter, right? You’re just an adopted son.” Chen Qing paused for a moment before continuing, “If you think that only a son can inherit the bloodline, does that mean you tell everyone openly that Earl Mark has no descendants?”𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“He raised you painstakingly, but you’re cursing him. You’re simply heartless!” Lina immediately added fuel to the fire.

From the corner of her eye, Lina glanced at Chen Qing. She had been in contact with Chen Qing for a long time. In her impression, Chen Qing had always been a calm person. He would never be so impulsive.

But now, Chen Qing was having a war of words with Wright.

Was Chen Qing furious with Wright?

At the thought of this, Lina couldn’t help but sigh. She had to remind Chen Qing lest his attention strayed.

Lina gently patted Chen Qing’s arm with her uninjured hand, preparing to whisper her plan into his ear.

Just as she was about to stand on her tiptoes, she twisted her foot and staggered, accidentally kissing Chen Qing’s cheek.

Just as the war was about to break out, Lina kissed Chen Qing.

The entire venue fell silent.

Everyone looked at Lina in shock. They had never expected to see such an erotic scene.

The gloom between Chen Qing’s brows slowly relaxed. He looked up slightly, and his eyes, which were originally dark without a trace of impurity, lit up.

The killing intent on his body had completely disappeared. His entire body emitted a gentleness like a spring breeze, and his lips curved up slightly.

After Lina held Chen Qing to steady herself, she turned red from head to toe. She grabbed Chen Qing’s arm nervously and explained anxiously, “I… I just… I just…”

She initially just wanted to tell Chen Qing how to deal with Wright. It didn’t seem appropriate to talk about this right now.

Lina thought for a moment before saying, “I have something to tell you.”

Wright, who was standing not far away, turned livid. He clenched his fists tightly.

Fuck.

He had brought people to insult Lina and embarrass her in front of everyone. He didn’t want to bring so many people to watch Lina be loving with another man.

If he wasn’t afraid that Chen Qing would kill him now, he would have gotten his subordinates to shoot the adulterous couple to death long ago.

Chen Qing looked at Lina’s blushing face and lowered his head naturally, staring unblinkingly at her. “What were you going to say just now?”

Lina blinked, her ears burning. She was clearly only talking to Chen Qing. For some reason, the way he looked at her made her feel a little embarrassed.

She turned her head to look elsewhere, ignoring the messy thoughts in her mind. She moved closer to his ear and told him her plan.

The two of them were in a stalemate for a while. The sun had already risen in the east.

It was almost dawn.

If it was morning, things would be difficult to handle.

Chen Qing waited for Lina to finish speaking. After some thought, he nodded.

Lina blushed and looked elsewhere.

Wright was so angry that his face turned red with agitation. These two f*ckers were actually flirting in front of him. Lina simply didn’t take him seriously.

This was his territory. He was not afraid of that adulterous couple at all.
