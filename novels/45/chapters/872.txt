873 Bone Marrow Transplant

With that, Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou and saw him looking at her, as if waiting for her to continue.

When Chen Qing heard Qiao Nian’s words, a trace of confusion flashed across his face. Puzzled, he asked, “Didn’t the results say that the two of them were biologically related?”

“A bone marrow transplant can change a person’s blood. By transfusing a normal person’s bone marrow into the patient’s bone marrow, it replaces the patient’s bone marrow and reconstructs the patient’s hematopoietic and immune functions. That way, the patient will survive.” Qiao Nian paused for a moment and continued, “But the values of the white blood cells and platelets of patients with bone marrow transplants are wrong. They have to take medicine continuously to be like ordinary people!”

When Chen Qing heard Qiao Nian’s words, he was stunned. He stammered, “Are you saying that she is relying on Xiao Shi’s bone marrow to survive?” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

When Qiao Nian heard Chen Qing’s words, she shook her head gently and said, “She shouldn’t have used Xiao Shi’s bone marrow. If she really used Xiao Shi’s bone marrow, the values in the two test reports should be identical.”

Chen Qing was a smart person. When he heard Qiao Nian’s words, he immediately understood. He said, “Could it be that she’s been using her mother’s bone marrow?”

Qiao Nian’s expression darkened. She nodded.

“Medically speaking, Song Man’s blood now is the blood made from Xiao Shi’s mother’s bone marrow. This is why the two appear to be biologically related because Song Man’s blood has already been changed. Song Man should know this too, which is why she pretended to be her mother .”

Where had her mother gone that time? Qiao Nian’s heart really ached for her mother.

Five years ago, she had been framed and lost her innocence.

Now, Xiao Shi was being taken care of by Song Man, who had a bone marrow transplant. Song Man had brought Xiao Shi here to replace her biological mother.

Gu Zhou understood what Qiao Nian was saying. His eyes darkened and his thin lips parted slightly. “If her hematopoietic system has been changed, then the skin on her body shouldn’t have changed.”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she nodded. “That’s right. Her hair and nails belong to her. We can take Song Man’s hair and Xiao Shi’s DNA for a paternity test. We should be able to get the most accurate result. Previously, we were able to conclude that they were mother and daughter because we used her blood for the paternity test.”

Gu Zhou’s expression instantly turned cold. “Then take her hair for another paternity test.”

Qiao Nian thought so too. As long as she used Song Man’s hair for a paternity test, she could completely confirm if Song Man was Xiao Shi’s mother.

Qiao Nian glanced at Gu Zhou, then walked into the ward.

When she entered the ward, she could hear Xiao Shi’s happy laughter from afar.

Song Man was sitting by Xiao Shi’s bed, talking gently to her.

Xiao Shi smiled happily and looked at Song Man with sparkling eyes.

When Qiao Nian saw the smile on Xiao Shi’s face, she felt a little depressed and sad.

If she knew that Song Man was not her mother, how sad she would be.

In her heart, Song Man was her entire world!

Even though the truth was cruel, Qiao Nian felt that it was necessary to tell Xiao Shi the truth.

When Song Man saw Qiao Nian approaching, the smile on her face gradually disappeared. She pursed her lips and asked unhappily, “Miss Qiao, what are you doing here?”

Qiao Nian walked up to Song Man. She didn’t speak. Under Song Man’s puzzled gaze, she grabbed a small strand of Song Man’s hair and pulled it off.

Song Man screamed in pain, her eyes red-rimmed. She looked at Qiao Nian angrily. “What are you doing!”

Xiao Shi, who was lying on the bed, was also shocked. She looked at Qiao Nian in surprise and called out in a low voice, “Auntie Nian Nian?”

When Qiao Nian heard Xiao Shi’s voice, she knew that she shocked. She looked at Xiao Shi gently and said, “I’m fine. Don’t worry, rest well!”

With that, Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Song Man’s face. Her eyes gradually turned cold. Suppressing the anger in her chest, she said, “I’m sorry, your sample was shattered by the doctor. The doctor asked me to come over and take another sample. This time, I’ll take your hair and do a paternity test for you.”
