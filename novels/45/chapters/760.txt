761 Twins?

Qiao Nian didn’t dare to look at Gu Zhou either. She pushed his hand away and walked out.

Gu Zhou stood rooted to the ground, staring unblinkingly at Qiao Nian’s retreating back.

Since yesterday, Qiao Nian seemed to have been avoiding him. Had he frightened her?

Qiao Nian drove straight to Dongjiang.

!!

This was where Gu Qi had lived previously. She found Gu Qi’s villa according to the location.

At this moment, not to mention that the door was open, Gu Qi was standing alone at the door. He seemed to have been waiting for her to arrive.

Qiao Nian hurriedly parked the car at the side and quickly ran to Gu Qi’s side. She squatted down and carefully examined Gu Qi’s entire body. Seeing that he was not injured, she heaved a sigh of relief and asked in confusion, “Xiao Qi, shouldn’t you be in school now?”

Towards the end, Qiao Nian recalled how Gu Qi had been bullied in school. She frowned and asked nervously, “Did someone bully you?” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Gu Qi shook his head and looked at Qiao Nian solemnly. “Auntie Nian Nian, if you suddenly see someone who looks exactly like you, what will you think of your relationship?”

Qiao Nian smiled and said without hesitation, “Of course I’ll think that we’re twins! Under normal circumstances, identical twins will look identical. However, although some people aren’t related by blood, they’ll still look alike. The chances of that happening are very low.”

When Gu Qi heard Qiao Nian’s words, he was instantly relieved.

In his opinion, Auntie Nian Nian had never made a mistake.

Gu Qi reached out and took Qiao Nian’s hand. He walked in and said seriously, “Auntie Nian Nian, I want to introduce a friend to you.”

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but smile. She asked happily, “So our Xiao Qi has found a good friend in school!”

She was very curious about what kind of child would catch Gu Qi’s eye and become his good friend.

Gu Qi was usually unwilling to speak much, so his friend was very likely a child who often liked to talk and laugh.

Just as Qiao Nian was thinking, Gu Qi had already pulled her to the bedroom on the second floor.

When she pushed the door open, Qiao Nian saw a thin child standing in the room.

The child had her head lowered. As her back was facing the light, Qiao Nian couldn’t see her face clearly.

She was wearing the clothes Gu Qi had been wearing when Qiao Nian first met him. However, this child had a ponytail.

It was a young lady!

Gu Qi had skipped school with a young lady.

Qiao Nian looked down at Gu Qi. Although it wasn’t good to skip class, she couldn’t scare the two children because of this.

“Xiao Qi, did you bring your good friend to visit your house?”

Xiao Shi’s head was still lowered. When she heard the voice, she froze.

This voice was so gentle, like her mother’s embrace.

Gu Qi shook his head seriously and said, “Auntie Nian Nian, she’s not my classmate.”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Qi in confusion. “Then she’s…”

“Look!”

At the same time, Xiao Shi looked up. When Qiao Nian saw her face, she was stunned.

Xiao Shi was also stunned.

When she was young, she had wanted to see what Auntie Nian Nian, who spoke gently, looked like.

However, when she saw Qiao Nian’s beautiful face, she was shocked.

Qiao Nian was also stunned.

That young lady actually looked exactly like Gu Qi.

However, the two of them were different. The young lady had a ponytail and looked valiant and heroic.

Jesus.

Qiao Nian recalled the first time she had seen Gu Qi. In a daze, Qiao Nian seemed to have returned to a few months ago.

“Xiao Qi?” Qiao Nian called out in a low voice.

Seeing this, Gu Qi reached out and tugged at the corner of Qiao Nian’s shirt. He hurriedly said, “Auntie Nian Nian, Xiao Qi is here. She’s Xiao Shi.”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Qi’s voice, she glanced at Gu Qi beside her, then at Xiao Xian, who was standing not far away.

She had never expected Gu Zhou to have a daughter.

She felt that Gu Qi and Xiao Shi should be twins.
