She felt that no one in this world could refuse this man’s request.

Moreover, she was still especially worried about Gu Zhou’s condition, so she said, “Alright, then wait for me downstairs obediently. I’ll look for you now.”

Qiao Nian’s voice also became gentle. Her gaze fell on Gu Zhou in the pavilion. After hanging up, she turned around and walked downstairs.

When Qiao Nian reached the entrance of the villa, she could see Zhou Zhou sitting upright in the pavilion from afar, looking like a kindergarten child.

When Zhou Zhou saw Qiao Nian, a bright smile appeared on his face.

His lips curved up slightly, and his beautiful eyes sparkled. They were clean and pure, without a trace of impurity.

His facial features were well-defined, but with such a smile, he looked pure.

For some reason, Qiao Nian’s heart began to race. She stopped in her tracks and stared unblinkingly at him.

Was this still the swift and decisive Gu Zhou?

He was clearly an obedient and cute little puppy.

Seeing him like this, she had no resistance.

Qiao Nian walked up to him. She looked down at him and reached out to him, smiling. “Zhou Zhou, let’s go back to sleep!”

Zhou Zhou’s gaze moved from Qiao Nian’s face to her hand. Smiling, he handed it over and gently placed it on Qiao Nian’s hand. He took the initiative to hold her hand.

Zhou Zhou stood up and gripped Qiao Nian’s hand tightly, as if he could hold her firmly in his palm.

When Zhou Zhou stood up, Qiao Nian still had a strange feeling. After all, he was a big CEO with long legs.

His hand gripped hers tightly. Qiao Nian felt her hand heat up.

“Let’s go home!” Qiao Nian smiled at Zhou Zhou and said gently.

When Zhou Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, a satisfied smile appeared on his face. It was as if as long as Qiao Nian was around, his entire world would be complete.

Zhou Zhou silently opened his hand and interlocked his fingers. He nodded obediently. “Okay!”

Qiao Nian saw her face in Zhou Zhou’s eyes and looked away shyly. Her gaze inadvertently fell on Zhou Zhou’s slightly curved lips, and for some reason, she felt her mouth go dry.

She wanted to kiss him.

When she realized this, her heart was in a mess, and her breathing involuntarily deepened.

She finally understood that Gu Zhou’s second personality had come to seduce her!

She was a little worried that her composure was not strong enough!

Qiao Nian wanted to look away, but his lips seemed to have some inexplicable magic. She couldn’t bear to look away.

At this moment, on the second floor of the Gu family villa.

Matriarch Gu woke up from her dream. She sat up, but she could no longer remember the situation in her dream.

Frustrated, she walked to the window and was about to admire the moon when her gaze inadvertently fell on the garden pavilion. She happened to see Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian standing there hand in hand. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Matriarch Gu’s lips curved up involuntarily. She saw the young couple walking into the villa hand in hand. She hurriedly hid behind the curtains, pretending not to know anything.

It seemed that the couple was quite shy. They were too embarrassed to kiss each other in the day, but they still wanted to get close to each other in the middle of the night.

It wouldn’t be long before Qiao Nian gave birth.

The uneasiness in Old Madam Gu’s heart instantly disappeared, leaving only happiness!

Qiao Nian was so focused on Zhou Zhou that she naturally didn’t notice Matriarch Gu’s probing gaze.

Walking into the villa, Qiao Nian glanced at Zhou Zhou, wanting to retract her hand. However, she didn’t expect Zhou Zhou to grip her so tightly that she couldn’t retract her hand at all.

Zhou Zhou lowered his gaze slightly and looked at Qiao Nian in confusion. He asked curiously, “Nian Nian, do you not want Zhou Zhou anymore?”

Hearing his low voice, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but look up and meet Zhou Zhou’s aggrieved and disappointed eyes.

Qiao Nian couldn’t bear it. She explained softly, “You’ll have to go back to your room to sleep later. I’ll go back to my room to sleep too.”

When Zhou Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, his eyes lit up. He said excitedly, “Then Zhou Zhou will sleep with Nian Nian. Zhou Zhou will protect Nian Nian!”
