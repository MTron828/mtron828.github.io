1113 Gu Yue is Still Alive?

Qiao Nian’s pupils dilated involuntarily!

Gu Yue?

Gu Zhou’s eldest brother!

So Gu Zhou’s eldest brother was really still alive, and he was still in MY!

!!

Moreover, Jiang Chi knew that Gu Yue was still alive.

This diary was from two years ago in Jiang Cheng. At that time, Gu Yue had already disappeared for four years in the eyes of the Gu family!

If Gu Yue was alive and well, why didn’t he go home?

Could it be that Gu Yue was being forced to not go home?

Or did Gu Yue have his difficulties?

However, it could prove one thing now. Gu Yue was still alive!

At that time, her grandfather and Gu Yue had disappeared together. Did that mean that her grandfather was still alive?

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but feel excited. She had to tell Gu Zhou about this later. As for Qin Chuan, she wanted to keep it a secret for the time being, because there was no evidence that her grandfather was still alive. These were just her guesses.

Qiao Nian continued reading the next article.

[On Sunday, 4.9, the weather was clear.

When I went to the cafe to buy coffee, I bumped into Brother Gu Yue again. How strange. Brother Gu Yue doesn’t seem to recognize me anymore. He ignored me when I spoke to him this time. Could it be that I’ve really mistaken him for someone else? Could it be that Brother Gu Yue was only concerned about my health yesterday because he was socializing politely? ”

Qiao Nian’s hands trembled slightly, as if a basin of cold water had been poured over her head. Her entire body turned cold!

From the diary of the past two days in Jiang Cheng, it could be seen that his communication with Gu Yue was just ordinary social etiquette. On April 9th, he realized that Gu Yue didn’t seem to know him.

Qiao Nian continued reading!

[Monday, 2.27. The weather is clear.

This illness acted up so quickly. I can feel my life slipping away. I don’t want to die in front of Big Brother, nor do I want him to know the cause of my death. It just so happens that Brother Lu Zhu is discussing business here. I’ll go to An City to take a look. I’ll say that I want to study medicine with Brother Lu Zhu’s mother. Big Brother will definitely agree to let me go!”

[Tuesday, 4.11. A light rain.

He was going to An City today. I’m a little excited! So Brother Lu Zhu isn’t an only child. He has several younger brothers and a sister. I heard that Brother Lu Zhu originally had two sisters. The eldest daughter of the Lu family was kidnapped and killed when she was three years old. No wonder Brother Lu Zhu occasionally looks sad.]

[Wednesday, 4.12. Sunny.

Brother Lu Zhu held an auction and invited me to it. I looked at the bustling crowd and felt a little lonely. Although I was standing in the middle of the crowd, I always felt out of place. Fortunately, Lu Qi has been accompanying me. She’s really a cute young lady. She’s the muse in my heart.]

To Qiao Nian’s surprise, Jiang Cheng drew a smiley face under this diary.

Qiao Nian had a feeling that Jiang Cheng was very happy in the Lu family, but she couldn’t help but feel sad. Jiang Cheng wasn’t in good health, and his days were numbered.

[Thursday, 4.13. Sunny.

I learned a lot from Brother Lu Zhu’s mother. Unfortunately, I won’t need it in the future.]

[Friday, 4.14. Sunny.

There’s no end to learning. Brother Lu Zhu’s mother is so knowledgeable.]

[Saturday, 4.15. Sunny.

Lu Qi also likes to study medicine. She’s so smart. She’ll definitely become an outstanding doctor in the future.]

[On the 16th of April, Sunday, sunny.

Lu Qi will take me out to play today. An City is so prosperous. I like An City so much.]

[Monday, 4.17. Sunny.

Strange, there seems to be something wrong with this sample?

[Tuesday, 4.18. Cloudy.

That person mentioned the eldest daughter of the Lu family when he called? I didn’t dare to get too close, afraid that I would be discovered.]

[Wednesday, 4.19. Heavy rain.

What should I do? Brother Lu Zhu seems to be missing his sister again. Should I tell him that his sister isn’t dead?

When Qiao Nian saw the diary entry of Jiang Cheng on April 19, she was stunned.

Did Jiang Cheng know that the eldest daughter of the Lu family was not dead?

Lu Qi was living well. The “sister” Jiang Cheng was referring to should be the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

Strange.

How did Jiang Cheng know that the eldest daughter of the Lu family was still alive?

Qiao Nian flipped back eagerly. Her hands were trembling, and her blood was boiling.
