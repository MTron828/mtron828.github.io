1105 It’s All His Fault

As long as Sister Nian didn’t have a strange man’s child, he felt a little better.

Although Sister Nian did not say anything at that time, he knew in his heart that she wanted to give birth.

He didn’t argue with Sister Nian. He just silently endured his dissatisfaction and got drunk every day. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Later on, Sister Nian said that the mental hospital was very quiet. She still wanted to study the cultivation theory left behind by her grandfather in the mental hospital.

!!

He was like a walking corpse every day, not knowing what to do.

It was Sister Nian who reminded him and helped him find a living person.

“The police haven’t found anything about Grandpa, which means that he’s still alive. He’s still waiting for us to find him.”

His only motivation every day was Sister Nian’s words.

Other than flying around the world to look for his grandfather, he spent the rest of his time in the mental hospital with Sister Nian.

However, two days before Sister Nian was about to give birth, he prepared to return to An City to guard her.

Although he wanted to tear the man who had ruined Sister Nian into pieces, he couldn’t find any news of that person.

The only thing he could do was take good care of Sister Nian.

He sat at the airport in Kun City, waiting to get on the plane back to An City.

However, his subordinates sent news that he had seen his grandfather on the spiritual mountain.

He immediately flew back to An City, thinking that he would go to the spiritual mountain after Sister Nian gave birth.

However, Sister Nian also knew that his grandfather had appeared on the spiritual mountain. She asked him to go to the spiritual mountain to look for his grandfather first and even said that when he found his grandfather, he would bring him back to accompany her when she gave birth.

He wanted to refuse, but Sister Nian insisted that he bring his grandfather to see her.

He thought for a while. When Sister Nian was about to give birth, she would definitely be happier with her grandfather around.

Hence, he agreed to Qiao Nian’s request and went straight to the spiritual mountain. He searched the entire spiritual mountain, but he still couldn’t find any trace of his grandfather.

Hence, he agreed to Qiao Nian’s request and went straight to the spiritual mountain. He searched the entire spiritual mountain, but he still couldn’t find any trace of his grandfather.

At that time, Sister Nian had already suffered from postpartum depression. At that time, when he saw Sister Nian’s despair, he yearned to die for the two children. He didn’t want to see Sister Nian’s lifeless face.

Although he often went to see Sister Nian when she was pregnant, he never asked about the children because he didn’t want Sister Nian to give birth.

Sister Nian seemed to know what he was thinking. She never spoke about children.

It was him.

It was all his fault.

If he could go and look for Sister Nian first, Sister Nian would not have to suffer!

Qin Chuan gradually fell into self-blame.

Qiao Nian looked into Qin Chuan’s eyes and naturally knew what he was thinking. She called out, “Old Qin, you’re not to blame for what happened back then. I didn’t notice the danger. I was always worried that Su Xue and the others would attack me, but I ignored the other dangers. I was too careless.”

Qin Chuan looked at Qiao Nian seriously. He felt that what had happened back then was too strange. There weren’t so many coincidences in the world.

When Sister Nian was about to give birth, he found out that his grandfather had appeared on the spiritual mountain!

Qin Chuan’s frown deepened, and his heart sank. “I’m completely sure now. Back then, when I found out that Grandpa had appeared on the spiritual mountain, it was also carefully planned by those people. They wanted to lure me away. Then, when you gave birth, they would take away your and Gu Zhou’s child without anyone knowing!”

As Qin Chuan spoke, his gaze lingered on Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou’s faces. He asked seriously, “If I remember correctly, Song Man knows about the two of you? She also knows that Sister Lu is the eldest daughter of the Lu family?”

Qiao Nian nodded. “I might have done a bone marrow transplant for Song Man in the past.”

“I have a bold idea!” Qin Chuan said. “The people who kidnapped Sister Nian from the Lu family back then should be the same group of people who schemed against the two of you six years ago. They should also have taken your children away! Are they your enemies?”

Hearing Qin Chuan’s words, Qiao Nian glanced at Gu Zhou, who was sitting beside her.

Gu Zhou’s phoenix-like eyes narrowed slightly, his gaze darkening. “Before I found out that Xiao Shi was my daughter, I always thought that the person who schemed against me was my brother!”
