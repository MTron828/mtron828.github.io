1094 I Dare Not Think

Qiao Yu knew in his heart that Qiao Shan already regretted his previous decision. He couldn’t bring up what had happened again.

He had just come out of the ancestral hall and was about to return to his room to rest when he seemed to hear his mother’s cry from afar. He rushed over, but he did not expect his father to almost strangle his mother to death.

In the past, his father had a bad temper. Sometimes, he would hit his mother. At that time, he stopped him whenever he could.

Ever since his father found out that his mother was having an affair, his father hit her even more brazenly. He had heard these things from his sister. When he was at home, his father never hit her.

!!

Qiao Yu frowned slightly and asked, “Why did you fall out with Mom?”

“It’s all because she’s despicable. She…” Qiao Shan wanted to tell her everything about Su Xue, but the person sitting in front of him was his son, so he couldn’t bring himself to do so.

Qiao Shan lowered his gaze and inadvertently saw the letter Qiao Xin had written for him on the ground. He pointed at the letter, his lips trembling with anger. “Take a look for yourself!”

Qiao Yu looked at Qiao Shan in confusion. He stood up and walked to the door, picking up the letter from the ground. When he saw the first line of words, his pupils dilated uncontrollably.

His hands trembled. Suppressing his discomfort, he read two more lines. Slowly, he closed his eyes and placed the letter on the bed with a complicated expression. He lowered his head and walked back to the bay window to sit down.

Back then, when he found out that his mother had cheated on his father, he immediately asked his father and mother to divorce. He even found out that his mother had cheated on his father a long time ago.

Although he had long known his mother’s nature, he had never expected her to be so outrageous and lewd! As her child, he could not accept it at all.

Qiao Yu felt as if a huge rock was pressing down on his chest, causing him to be short of breath. He could roughly understand why his father had attacked his mother just now.

However, understanding was one thing. He didn’t want his father to commit a crime, let alone be sad.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Yu looked up and saw Qiao Shan’s face.

Qiao Shan had a square face, thick eyebrows, and big eyes. He looked like someone from a period drama.

But it wasn’t the same for him and Qiao Xin. Their faces were narrow.

Could it be that he and Qiao Xin weren’t Qiao Shan’s…

No, no, no.

Qiao Yu hurriedly threw the random thoughts to the back of his mind. How could he and Qiao Xin not be Qiao Shan’s children?

They must be their father’s biological children! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Yu really didn’t dare to continue thinking about it. He didn’t know how to face Qiao Shan either. The Qiao family was really about to be lost.

Qiao Yu lowered his head slightly and said softly, “I’ll think of another way.”

With that, Qiao Yu stood up and walked out.

Qiao Shan sat in his wheelchair and watched as Qiao Yu left. The letter Qiao Xin had left behind appeared in his mind. Suddenly, an idea flashed across his mind.

Were these two children his children?

When Qiao Shan realized this, he hurriedly came back to his senses. Why was he letting his imagination run wild? Of course those two children were his. How could they be someone else’s children?

Qiao Yu was so outstanding. Although Qiao Xin had done something wrong, Qiao Xin was also very outstanding in the past.

Only he had such outstanding genes!

That’s right. These two children must be his children. He shouldn’t let his imagination run wild.

…

As Gu Zhou drove, he glanced at Qiao Nian from the corner of his eye. Seeing Qiao Nian sitting in the front passenger seat with a dejected expression, he asked in confusion, “Are you unhappy because of the Qiao family?”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s question, she forced a smile and shook her head gently. “No.”

Gu Zhou suddenly remembered that Qiao Nian had something very important to tell him. He looked up at Qiao Nian and asked, “What do you want to tell me?”

“Let’s talk when we get home,” Qiao Nian said gently, smiling at Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou stepped on the accelerator and quickly drove towards the Dongjiang villa.

When they arrived at the Dongjiang villa, Gu Zhou parked the car at the entrance and walked into the villa with his arm around Qiao Nian’s waist.

When they walked to the living room, Gu Zhou couldn’t help but lower his head and plant a kiss on Qiao Nian’s forehead. His low voice was magnetic and mesmerizing. “Nian’er, if there’s anything, just tell me.”
