The hyacinths Qiao Nian had carved seemed to originally carved on the urn to begin with. It didn’t look like it had been repaired at all. All the traces of sulfuric acid had disappeared.

Qiao Nian got the servant to bring the paint over and carefully applied it all.

After Qiao Nian had completely repaired the urn, she said, “It’s done.”

The others stepped forward and were all stunned when they saw the Lu family’s eldest daughter’s urn.

The original urn was simple, but after Qiao Nian’s modifications, it became more exquisite and bold.

Matriarch Lu looked at the urn and couldn’t help but sigh. “Nian Nian is really skilled. I really didn’t expect such a fair and delicate hand to be able to carve such beautiful flowers!” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

When Gu Zhou heard Matriarch Lu’s words, his eyes sparkled with laughter. His gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face.

Matriarch Lu didn’t praise people easily. It seemed that Matriarch Gu really liked Qiao Nian’s carvings.

Lu Zhu’s gaze landed on Qiao Nian’s face, and his eyes darkened slightly. His sister must have suffered greatly to be able to master carving.

Previously, he had heard from others that when engravers practiced, they often hurt their hands. His sister was most afraid of pain. She must have suffered many injuries when she was young to be able to carve such a beautiful thing.
