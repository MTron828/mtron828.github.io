874 Testing Her Hair

As soon as Qiao Nian finished speaking, Song Man’s expression changed.

If she used her hair for a DNA paternity test, her future wealth would no longer exist.

With this thought in mind, Song Man reached out to snatch her hair from Qiao Nian’s hand.

Qiao Nian turned around and avoided Song Man’s snatch.

Qiao Nian handed Song Man’s hair to Chen Qing behind her and said, “Use this to test. Go!”

Chen Qing nodded and walked out with his hair.

At this moment, Song Man’s expression had also changed, and her eyes were filled with panic. She looked at Qiao Nian angrily, forgetting to hide her gaze.

Gu Zhou walked in with an indifferent expression. When he saw Song Man’s pale face, he understood. It seemed that their guess outside was right.

Song Man was indeed not the girl from five years ago, nor was she the mother of the two children.

Xiao Shi looked at everyone in confusion. Her gaze finally landed on Qiao Nian’s face and she asked in confusion, “Auntie Nian Nian, what happened? Why did you ask Mommy to do a paternity test? Mommy gave birth to me. This can’t be wrong!”

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Xiao Shi’s face, and her eyes were filled with a smile. She said gently, “Some things will come to fruition later. Xiao Shi, Auntie Nian Nian will tell you the reason later, okay?”

When Song Man heard Qiao Nian’s words, she swallowed and asked in fear, “Qiao Nian, are you trying to harm me?”

“Miss Song, what are you saying? Why would I harm you?” Qiao Nian looked at Song Man coldly and asked.

Was Song Man delusional about being persecuted? Or was she pretending to be pitiful in front of Xiao Shi?

“Are you trying to sow discord between me and Xiao Shi because you’re afraid that I’ll become Madam Gu?” Song Man asked, pretending to be calm. She knew that what she was saying now looked very strange to others.

She told Xiao Shi that Qiao Nian was jealous of her, so she lied.

In that case, no matter what Qiao Nian said, she would be suspicious.

Even if Qiao Nian told Xiao Shi that she wasn’t her biological mother, Xiao Shi wouldn’t believe her.

Qiao Nian was so angry that she laughed. She said coldly, “Do you think it’s appropriate for you to say this in front of the child now? Alright, come out with me now. Let’s go outside and make things clear!”

Xiao Shi sat on the bed, her gaze sizing up Song Man and Qiao Nian. In the end, she looked at Song Man worriedly.

Song Man clenched her fists tightly, her nails digging into her palms.

Qiao Nian was simply too arrogant.

She knew very well that if the results of the appraisal were out, everything she wanted would be gone. She could only escape like a stray dog.

She wasn’t sure if the doctor had really accidentally knocked over her blood sample just now, or if Qiao Nian had deliberately found an excuse to appraise her DNA using her hair.

Song Man lowered her gaze.

Could it be that Qiao Nian had seen through her blood test?

This was unlikely.

Previously, she had used her own blood and Xiao Shi’s blood for a paternity test. At that time, the results were that they were mother and daughter, and there was nothing strange about the data.

Could it be that Qiao Nian had just been testing her?

That’s right. Qiao Nian must have been testing her just now, but her first reaction had already betrayed her.

At that time, she acted like she was guilty.

Qiao Nian must have seen that she was feeling guilty. That was why she was certain that she wasn’t Xiao Shi’s biological mother.

Suddenly, an idea flashed across Song Man’s mind. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Had Qiao Nian discovered what had happened more than twenty years ago?

Song Man pursed her lips.

Not many people knew that Qiao Nian was the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

Back then, in order to fake Qiao Nian’s death, she had used her broken arm and faked that it was Qiao Nian’s arm.

No!

Qiao Nian shouldn’t know about this.

If Qiao Nian had known about this long ago, she would definitely have stood in front of her and said all of this arrogantly.

It seemed that Qiao Nian hadn’t found out what had happened back then.
