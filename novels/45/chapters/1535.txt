1536 Drugged

Smiling, Annie stood up and gently hooked her right index finger around the man’s belt.

“Look at me. Do you think I’m very good-looking?” Annie looked up at the man in front of her, her eyes filled with gentleness. She wrapped her arms around the man’s neck and blew gently at his face.

The man looked at Annie in front of him. Everything around him no longer seemed to matter. He only had eyes for Annie.

He clearly hated Annie the most, but now he couldn’t help but want to approach her. His voice trembled slightly as he said, “I-I’m leaving…”

Annie watched as the man’s gaze gradually unfocused. His voice slurred. The smile in her eyes instantly disappeared, replaced by disgust.

She had originally specially prepared this special aphrodisiac for Gu Zhou, but before she could get close to him, she was locked up.

For now, she could only use this man to help her get out of her predicament.

Suppressing her nausea, she placed something in the man’s hand and stood on her tiptoes to whisper in his ear, “Give it to someone. After that, I’ll be yours. You can do whatever you want, and my money will be yours.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The man lowered his head inch by inch and looked at the ring in his hand. There were complicated patterns on the ring, as if it was a very antique item.

His mind was in a mess. Although he knew that he shouldn’t pass this thing to someone else for Annie, he obediently gripped the ring tightly.

At this moment, the man’s eyes alternated between rationality and confusion. His mind seemed to be in a dilemma.

Seeing this, Annie kissed the man’s lips without hesitation. Her slender fingers quickly unbuttoned the man’s shirt.

Smelling Annie’s fragrance, the lust in the man’s eyes burned him out. He took the initiative and mercilessly tore open Annie’s clothes.

Annie was pressed to the ground by the man. She wrapped her legs around the man’s waist and asked with a smile, “Brother, is it okay?”

The man said heavily, “Yes.”

The temperature in the interrogation room gradually rose. It was filled with an ambiguous atmosphere.

Half an hour later, the man slipped out of the interrogation room silently and ran out of the palace.

Annie took her time straightening her clothes. Even with blood flowing from the corner of her mouth, she still smiled smugly.

…

Qiao Nian looked at the map of Europe on the desk. According to the characteristics of the Colorful Fungus, she lowered her head and circled a few places on the map.

Holding Qiao Nian’s map, the guards of the palace went out to look for it.

That night, Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou stayed in the palace.

Lina stood at the side, looking at Qiao Nian nervously.

Qiao Nian picked up the “Colorful Fungus” the guards had picked one by one and glanced at them. In the end, she put them back and shook her head. “None of them.”

Although these plants looked very similar to Colorful Fungus, none of them were Colorful Fungus. It seemed that she had to pick the herbs herself.

Gu Zhou had been sitting beside Qiao Nian the entire time. He scrolled through the photos on his cell phone. In the photos, there were all kinds of colorful fungi. None of the colorful fungi on the table were the same as the photos. These guards were really too inept.

Lina looked at Qiao Nian worriedly. Based on the guards’ method of searching, she didn’t know when they would find the Colorful Fungus. What should she do?

Qiao Nian looked at Lina and said, “I’ll go pick it now.”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he said, “I’ll go with you.”

Qiao Nian hurriedly waved her hand and said, “We’re just going to the mountains to pick herbs. Don’t worry, I’ll go with Lina. Aren’t you busy with other things? Go ahead.”

When Lina heard Qiao Nian’s words, her lips curved up slightly. Worried that she would interfere as a third wheel, she hurriedly said, “Nian Nian, I’ll go prepare now.”

“Okay.”
