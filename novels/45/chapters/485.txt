Chapter 486: You Look Nervous

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Doctor Sha thought that made sense and nodded without saying anything else.

Doctor Sha looked at Qiao Nian in agreement. Qiao Nian already knew that she and Lu Zhu were siblings. She was probably looking for a suitable time to acknowledge him.

Although Mr. Lu was already out of danger, the place where he was injured was above his heart. If his emotions fluctuated too much, the consequences would be unimaginable.

Qiao Nian probably didn’t want to acknowledge her family because she was worried about Mr. Lu’s health!

The current Qiao Nian already treated Mr. Lu as family!

Doctor Sha locked the identification documents in the safe.

“Thank you, Doctor Sha!”

“Doctor Qiao is too polite!”

When Qiao Nian left Doctor Sha’s office, she walked towards the ward. From afar, she could hear the sound of leather shoes stepping on the ground. She looked up and saw Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou’s eyes were as deep as the starry sky. Qiao Nian’s heart inexplicably tightened.

Due to her relationship with Lu Zhu, Qiao Nian’s gaze was no longer as calm as before.

She retracted her gaze uncomfortably and walked up to Gu Zhou. “Why are you up?”

Gu Zhou naturally noticed Qiao Nian’s discomfort. He narrowed his eyes and said in a low voice, “When I woke up, I didn’t see you.”

Qiao Nian raised her hand to look at the time on her wrist. Gu Zhou had only slept for about thirty minutes. Recalling that Gu Zhou was still injured, she asked gently, “Do you want to go to the hotel and sleep for a while more?”

Gu Zhou didn’t answer Qiao Nian immediately. Instead, he walked up to her and stared at her intently.

Gu Zhou gradually looked down and saw Qiao Nian’s hands clenched into small fists. Perhaps she had used too much strength because her knuckles were white.

Qiao Nian looked nervous.

Gu Zhou reached out and gently touched Qiao Nian’s hand with his index finger.

Qiao Nian’s body stiffened. Then, her hand moved slightly, releasing a little.

The tip of the man’s index finger pierced through the gap between Qiao Nian’s fingers. His fingers pressed tightly against her palm, and his nails accidentally scratched her fingertips.

Qiao Nian’s breathing involuntarily quickened. She looked up at Gu Zhou, who was standing at the side, and subconsciously wanted to retract her hand.

However, Gu Zhou gripped Qiao Nian’s hand tightly. His fingers were crossed, and his fingers were tightly interlocked with hers. His dark eyes were covered in a thick fog, making it impossible to tell what he was thinking. He said in a low voice, “You look very nervous.”

Hearing Gu Zhou’s words, Qiao Nian’s heart rose to her throat nervously. Her breathing quickened as she explained, “I-I just went to look for Doctor Sha. He said that Mr. Lu’s wound might be at risk of infection, so I need to pay more attention to it. That’s why I’m a little worried about him!”

Qiao Nian explained naturally. This was also why she had come to Doctor Sha’s office.

Actually, Qiao Nian was still very hesitant. Should she tell Gu Zhou directly that she and Lu Zhu were biological siblings?

Without a word, Gu Zhou pulled Qiao Nian forward.

Qiao Nian didn’t pull her hand out again. Instead, she followed obediently.

When Qiao Nian saw that Gu Zhou had already pulled her past Lu Zhu’s ward and was still walking forward, she asked in surprise, “Where are we going now?”

Gu Zhou didn’t let go of Qiao Nian’s hand. “Didn’t you say we were going to the hotel to rest?”

“Why don’t you go back and rest? I’m not tired now. I’ll stay here and watch over him.” Qiao Nian smiled, but her tone was firm. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The strange feeling in Gu Zhou’s heart grew stronger and stronger. He narrowed his eyes slightly and looked at Qiao Nian sternly, his gaze turning colder and colder.
