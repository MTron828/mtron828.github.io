Chapter 163 Grandma Has Arrived

“The riddle I gave just now was to let everyone’s imagination run wild. In the future, in any field, we can try some bold ideas and methods. There’s no need to constrain ourselves to known methods. Who knows, we might get an unexpected result.” Qiao Nian smiled at everyone and continued, “For example, the way the Suranne Grass grows is very different from ordinary plants…”

After that, Qiao Nian made public the cultivation methods of Suranne Grass.

Everyone was completely stunned. They had never expected that Suranne Grass was cultivated using such strange methods.

Everyone listened with relish. They even planned to try it out when they returned home.

When the Q & A session began, everyone raised questions regarding cultivation of plants.

Smiling, Qiao Nian answered each and every one of them. The atmosphere of the speech ceremony grew more and more pleasant.

“Lecturer Qiao Nian truly deserves her reputation, and her status as the first speaker.”

“What a great speech. She’s so young, yet she’s so proficient and capable. I’m truly ashamed of myself.”

“What should we do? I want to listen to more of her lectures, but it’s such a pity that she can only give us this short lecture.”

“I remember who was looking down on her previously. Now, they’ve all been slapped in the face!”

Jiang Yue sat there, listening to everyone praise Qiao Nian. Her breathing grew more and more erratic, and beads of sweat appeared on her forehead. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Jiang Yue had to admit that Qiao Nian had spoken very well. She was much better prepared than she was.

Jiang Yue felt the pressure mounting.

At this moment, an old lady entered the banquet hall.

Although she was old, she was dressed elegantly. When she was young, she must have been a drop dead gorgeous beauty.

The old lady, wearing a dark brown gown, walked in. Her manner was kindly.

Liu Yu was the first to see the old lady. She hurriedly patted Jiang Yue’s arm and said excitedly, “Yue Yue, your grandmother has come to see your speech!”

Jiang Yue’s heart leaped to her throat. She tried hard to suppress the unease in her heart. Her features relaxed and she smiled at Matriarch Gu, who was not far away. She waved at Matriarch Gu. “Grandma!”

Matriarch Gu looked over. When she saw Jiang Yue’s gown, her smile froze.

What… What was going on?

Why was Jiang Yue wearing this gown?

She had made this gown for Nian Nian!

Qiao Nian saw Matriarch Gu as well. She also noticed that Matriarch Gu didn’t look well and was frowning slightly.

She had been wondering about how to get the gown back without Matriarch Gu knowing. Only then would she not waste Matriarch Gu’s efforts and good intentions.

However, Qiao Nian had never expected Matriarch Gu to attend the speech directly.

A trace of worry flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes. If Matriarch Gu had a heart attack, that would be disastrous.

With that thought in mind, Qiao Nian wrapped up her speech in a few words. Then, she bowed to everyone and ended the speech.

Just as Qiao Nian was about to leave, thunderous applause exploded in the hall.

Qiao Nian saw Jiang Yue walk towards Matriarch Gu first.

“Grandma.” Jiang Yue reached out to steady Matriarch Gu.

Matriarch Gu retracted her hand and took a step back. She looked at Jiang Yue coldly.

When everyone saw this, they were all stunned. They all knew that Matriarch Gu loved Jiang Yue the most.

Jiang Yue’s hand hovered in midair awkwardly. Her face was pale as she looked at Matriarch Gu uneasily. “Grandma, what’s wrong?”

Matriarch Gu had always had a good temper, but this time, she could barely suppress her emotions. With a cold expression, she asked, “Jiang Yue, what is wrong with you? Why are you wearing the gown I’ve specially prepared for Nian Nian?”

Matriarch Gu’s words resounded throughout the entire lecture hall. Everyone was stunned.

Goodness, so Jiang Yue was really wearing Qiao Nian’s gown.

At that moment, it was as if Jiang Yue was struck with lightning. Her mind went completely blank. She couldn’t hear anything apart from the ringing in her ears.

She sensed that everyone was looking at her, despising her, and spurning her with scorn!
