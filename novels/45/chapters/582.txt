Chapter 583: Applying Medicine

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Under the light, the scar on his back was like a long snake that was coiling. Some of his flesh was exposed. How painful was that?

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian opened the medicine box. If she wanted to change the dressing, she had to get rid of the scabs on his body that were stuck to the gauze. She couldn’t even tear his wound. This was a huge challenge for Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian frowned. She opened the medicine box and took out a pair of scissors. Looking at the scar, she subconsciously blew on it.

Gu Zhou had been lying on his side the entire time. The hand under the blanket gradually clenched into a fist, its knuckles turning white.

Qiao Nian didn’t notice Gu Zhou’s small movements. All her attention was on Gu Zhou’s wound. She helped him unwrap the old gauze, disinfect it, apply medicine, and then bandage it again. It took her a total of half an hour.

If she wasn’t afraid of hurting Gu Zhou, she would have been done long ago.

After doing this, Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. She quietly packed up the medicine box, pulled the blanket over, and covered Gu Zhou with it. Her gaze inadvertently fell on Gu Zhou’s handsome face.

Zhou Zhou and Gu Chuan’s faces flashed in Qiao Nian’s mind again. She hurriedly retracted her gaze and left with the medical kit.

The light in the room disappeared. When Gu Zhou heard the door close, he opened his eyes.

There was no trace of light in those dark eyes.

He recalled how Qiao Nian had blown on his wound just now. It was as if a feather had brushed past his heart. It was soft and a little strange.

Gu Zhou couldn’t describe this feeling. He had never felt this way before.

At this moment, he couldn’t help but recall how Gu Qi had proudly said, “Auntie likes me the most.”

From the looks of it, Qiao Nian would prefer…

Gu Zhou’s thoughts stopped. A name flashed in his mind.

“Gu Chuan.”

This name was very familiar, but he couldn’t remember where he had heard it before.

Gu Zhou sat up, turned on the bedside lamp, and called Chen Qing.

“Second Young Master.”

“Go and investigate someone called Gu Chuan. The more detailed his information is, the better!”

When Chen Qing heard Gu Zhou’s words, he nodded. “I’ll investigate tomorrow morning.”

“I hope I can see all his information when I wake up tomorrow!”

“Then I’ll investigate now!”

As soon as Chen Qing finished speaking, the phone rang.

Chen Qing’s frown deepened. Second Young Master was actually so anxious to get information on this person. Who exactly was this person?

Silently, he got up and prepared to work.

Qiao Nian returned to the guest room and recalled that Lu Zhu had called her. Previously, she had been too busy to reply.

Qiao Nian was about to call back when she saw that it was already past four o’clock. She sent Lu Zhu a message. “Brother, what’s wrong?”

Just as she sent the message, Lu Zhu called.

After Qiao Nian answered the call, she saw that Lu Zhu seemed to be standing in a room with pink walls. Her eyes flickered.

Previously, on the anniversary of the death of the eldest daughter of the Lu family, she had gone with them. She still remembered that this house had been specially prepared for the eldest daughter of the Lu family. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

She still remembered that the eldest daughter of the Lu family’s house was like a fairy tale castle. There were also clothes of all ages in the wardrobe.

At that time, she was still very envious of the eldest daughter of the Lu family. So many people coveted her, but she had never expected her to be the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

“Brother,” Qiao Nian greeted with a smile.

“Sugar, I slept too much on the plane. I’m not tired. I just wanted to see if you were asleep.”

“I’m not sleepy either.” Qiao Nian smiled.

“I want to show you your room.” With that, Lu Zhu turned the camera around.

Qiao Nian’s eyes instantly softened. Her gaze fell on the phone screen, and the familiar items appeared. Her lips couldn’t help but tighten.

She couldn’t go home now. Brother was showing her around her room.
