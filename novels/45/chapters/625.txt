Chapter 626: Knocked Himself Out

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Fortunately, Auntie Nian Nian didn’t like her father now.

This meant that Auntie Nian Nian might fall in love with Mommy.

With this thought in mind, Gu Qi’s mood gradually improved. However, he didn’t know when his mommy would return. What if Auntie Nian Nian fell in love with someone else before his mommy returned?

No, no. He should be thinking about what to do if his father didn’t like Mommy.

That wasn’t right either. He wanted to be with Mommy and Auntie Nian Nian forever.

He liked Mommy and Auntie Nian Nian the most.

At the thought of this, Gu Qi couldn’t help but mutter, “Mommy, where are you now? Why haven’t you found Little Qi? I really miss you now. I want to be with you. I want you to be with Auntie Nian Nian…”

At this moment, Gu Qi’s phone suddenly rang.

He picked up his phone. When he saw the caller ID, the confusion and sorrow in his eyes gradually disappeared. His eyes were filled with joy, and his lips curved up slightly.

He hurriedly picked up the call and placed the phone to his ear. His voice was filled with joy. “Auntie Xu!”

An obedient and gentle voice came from the phone receiver.

“Little Qi, how have you been recently?”

Gu Qi sat down quietly and pushed the curtains aside. He leaned into the sunlight and felt its warmth. “Auntie Xu, I’ve been doing well recently.”

“Little Qi, you’ve improved very quickly. You speak more smoothly than before,” Xu Xin said gently.

“Little Qi has grown up, so my speech has become smoother.” At this point, Gu Qi frowned slightly. “Auntie Xu, you haven’t called Little Qi in a long time.”

If one listened carefully, they would be able to hear a hint of resentment in Gu Qi’s words. He seemed to be acting like a spoiled child.

Xu Xin wasn’t angry. She continued to explain gently with a smile, “Little Qi, Auntie knows that she’s in the wrong. She’s been busy with exams recently. Can you not be angry with Auntie?”

“Yes, Little Qi isn’t angry,” Gu Qi said, a smile in his eyes. “Auntie Xu, I’ve been very happy recently.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Really? I just want you to be happy. Can you tell me what made Little Qi so happy?” Xu Xin’s voice was still gentle.

“Dad has brought me home to stay. I’ll be able to live with Dad from now on.”

“Really?” Xu Xin said happily. “That’s great. Little Qi has always hoped to live with Mr. Gu. Now, his wish has been fulfilled!”

“Yes, Little Qi even met a very good auntie. She’s very good to me, and takes good care of me. I like her a lot too!” At this point, Gu Qi thought of Qiao Nian’s face and couldn’t help but smile. He really liked Auntie Nian Nian!

When Xu Xin heard Gu Qi’s words, she was slightly stunned. Pretending to be happy, she said, “Is Little Qi willing to communicate with the others now?”

When Gu Qi heard Xu Xin’s words, his expression gradually turned serious. He corrected her. “Auntie Xu, my aunt isn’t anyone else. She’s one of us!”

“Yes, Auntie said something wrong. Little Qi, talk to your Auntie more often in the future. This way, I won’t have to worry about you being alone.”

On the other end of the phone, Xu Xin didn’t have a trace of a smile in her eyes. She was frowning, but there was a hint of a smile in her voice.

She thought that Gu Qi was only willing to communicate with her.

At that time, apart from communicating with him, Gu Qi was also unwilling to communicate with his biological father.

Now that Gu Qi was willing to treat another woman as his family, it was obvious that Gu Qi really liked that woman.

Xu Xin pursed her lips, worry flashing in her eyes.

She was really worried that that woman would use Gu Qi. If Gu Qi got injured again, she was worried that Gu Qi would become even more lonely.

However, she couldn’t say these words directly to Gu Qi.

“Auntie Xu, when you come back, I’ll introduce Auntie Nian Nian to you, okay?” Gu Qi didn’t hear the worry in Xu Xin’s words and said happily.
