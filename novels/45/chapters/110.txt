Chapter 111: Kiss

Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

Gu Zhou was now exuding a chilling aura, as if the person he had just kissed wasn’t her.

If they were in a comic book, a line of crows would have been flying over Qiao Nian’s head”. She frowned.

Didn’t Gu Zhou have a phobia of women?

Yet, it didn’t seem like he had any such phobia after all!

Gu Zhou had already finished bandaging Qiao Nian’s wound. He stood up with an indifferent expression and placed the medical kit back in the cupboard.

“Gu Zhou!” Qiao Nian called out sharply.

Gu Zhou turned to look at Qiao Nian, who was still sitting on the sofa. He raised his eyebrow. “What’s wrong?”

“You actually kissed me!” Qiao Nian said in frustration, her eyes a little red.

“And?”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou, dissatisfied. She really hadn’t expected kissing to be such a casual affair in Gu Zhou’s eyes.

“Are you expecting thanks?” Qiao Nian said through gritted teeth.

“You’re welcome.”

Qiao Nian had never expected Gu Zhou to accept her thanks so shamelessly. Furious, she began breathing heavily. If only she could punch Gu Zhou right this instant!

This was the first time Gu Zhou had seen Qiao Nian in a rage. She no longer looked as sharp and cold as she usually did. Instead, she looked a touch more innocent and adorable. He thought for a while and said, “If you think you’ve gotten the short end of the stick, why don’t you kiss me back?”

Qiao Nian was speechless with shock and rage.

She exhaled a long breath, trying hard to suppress the anger in her heart. “There’s no need for that! Take off your clothes and go for your medicinal bath!”

Gu Zhou didn’t say anything else either. He followed Qiao Nian’s commands obediently.

Qiao Nian wrapped her bandaged wound in plastic wrap and performed acupuncture on Gu Zhou as he took the bath.

‘When she was done with that, it was time for her to give Gu Zhou a massage.

This time, Qiao Nian used a lot of force during the massage. She had thought that Gu Zhou would be in so much pain that he wouldn’t be able to take it. She didn’t expect Gu Zhou to have no reaction for the entirety of the massage.

Qiao Nian felt as if she was punching a ball of cotton wool. She simply couldn’t be bothered with Gu Zhou any longer. Standing up, she turned and left.

Gu Zhou sat alone in the bathtub. Looking at the closed bathroom door, his throat worked slightly.

His slender hand touched his lips lightly, and he recalled how Qiao Nian’s lips had felt on his.

Her lips were soft, and even carried a faint sweetness.

This feeling was actually identical to the impression that the girl from five years ago had left on him.2

Could it be that everyone’s lips tasted like this?

Or was it just Qiao Nian’s lips?

Gu Zhou’s mouth was a little dry. As he licked his lips, his eyes turned a shade darker.

After rinsing himself off in the shower, Gu Zhou stepped out of the bathroom. Immediately, he heard his phone ring from the bedside table.

He walked over to pick up the phone. After a while, he said gravely, “Alright. Please let Mr. Lin know that I’ll be there on time tomorrow!”

‘The next morning.

Many well-known figures of An City made their appearance at the opening of the newest research branch under the Lin family name.

Qiao Nian arrived early in the morning. Lin Tao was initially greeting guests, but when she saw Qiao Nian, she hurriedly ran up to her and said happily, “You’ve finally arrived! I’ve waited for so long! Why are you so late?”

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but laugh. She gently swiped at Lin Tao’s nose and said, “It’s only seven o’clock. The opening ceremony will start at ten o’clock. Is this considered late?”

“Fine, fine. I should have kidnapped you here yesterday!” Lin Tao said with a smile.

The two of them chatted and laughed as they walked to the backyard of the Lin Research Institute. Qiao Nian saw Director Lin pruning some expensive herbs.

‘When Director Lin saw Qiao Nian, a trace of surprise flashed in his eyes. However, when he saw that Qiao Nian’s hands were empty, he couldn’t help but frown. He said unhappily, “Didn’t you say that you wanted to give me a surprise? Where is the surprise?”

“The surprise is on the way. It’ll be here soon!” Qiao Nian’s smile was like a flower in bloom.

Hospital Director Lin was overjoyed. Looking at Qiao Nian happily, he reached out to stroke his white beard as he rebuked, “You’re too polite, child. Just bringing yourself is good enough. You don’t have to bring a gift along!”

Qiao Nian and Lin Tao looked at each other and smiled, a tacit understanding between them.
