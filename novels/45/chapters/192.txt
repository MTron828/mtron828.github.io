Chapter 193: The Police Have Arrived

Qiao Nian looked at Qiao Yu, who was standing in front of her, and narrowed her eyes. She had underestimated Qiao Yu.

Qiao Yu was a cold and heartless person. No matter what happened, he would always prioritize his own interests. However, she did not expect Qiao Yu to be just as cold and heartless towards his own biological mother, Su Xue.

Su Xue looked up at Qiao Yu, tears streaming down her face. She had raised her son painstakingly. He was her pride and joy, her ray of hope.

She didn’t know if she should say that Qiao Yu had become smarter and saved the Qiao family’s reputation, or that he had treated her ruthlessly, uncaring for his own mother.

Su Xue looked at Qiao Shan with indignation. With tears streaming down her face, she questioned, “Qiao Shan, we’ve been married for more than thirty years. Is this relationship really broken just like that? Are you really going to be so heartless as to divorce me?”

Qiao Shan couldn’t look at Su Xue.

Qiao Xin sniffled. Even after all of it, she couldn’t bear to part with Su Xue. After all, she had been raised by Su Xue since she was young. She looked at Qiao Shan in tears and begged, “Dad, there must be another way. I’m begging you not to divorce Mom. Please?”

When Qiao Yu heard Qiao Xin’s words, his expression darkened. He shouted sternly, “Stop talking!”

Qiao Xin trembled. She looked pathetically at Qiao Yu.

Looking at Qiao Xin’s tear-stained face, Qiao Yu’s heart couldn’t help but soften. He said softly, “If Mom and Dad don’t get a divorce now, then Mom will go to prison. Do you want Mom to stay in prison for three years?” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Qiao Xin looked at Qiao Yu with red-rimmed eyes. Of course she didn’t want her mother to go to prison. She didn’t want her father and mother to get a divorce either.

Her brother was right. If these divorce certificates didn’t exist, her mother would go to jail.

Qiao Yu had always doted on Qiao Xin. He said, “Alright, stop crying. If Mom really knows that she’s in the wrong and Dad can forgive and accept her, then Mom and Dad can remarry. However, the two of them can’t remarry now. Do you understand what I mean?”

Qiao Xin was no fool. She naturally understood what her brother meant. Now that things had come to this point, she couldn’t say anything else. She could only walk over to Su Xue and comfort her softly. “Mom, you have to work hard to gain Dad’s forgiveness. That way, our family can still be together!”

Updates by

When Su Xue heard Qiao Xin’s words, she nodded tearfully. She felt a trace of comfort. At least her daughter was on her side.

Qiao Shan didn’t even want to look at Su Xue. He turned his head to the side.

At this moment, the police had arrived.

“May I know if Miss Qiao was the one who reported the incident? She said that someone had an affair and was committing marital infidelity?”

When Qiao Xin heard the police officer’s question and thought of the two divorce certificates, she instantly felt more confident. She glared at Qiao Nian angrily. Without waiting for Qiao Nian to speak, she raised a finger and pointed at Qiao Nian. “Sir, that’s her. She didn’t know the whole story, so she called the police without thinking. She’s made a false report!”

The police officers looked confused.

They took a look at the situation in the room. They all could tell that someone had been having sex in that bed.

The Qiao family was considered quite well-known in An City. Naturally, the police also had a certain understanding of the Qiao family.

From the looks of it, Su Xue had indeed betrayed Qiao Shan. But what did Qiao Xin mean by that?

“What exactly is going on? Who called the police?” The police officer said, frowning.

Qiao Xin stood up and pointed at Qiao Nian. “It was her. It was her. She falsely accused my mother of cheating! My mother is innocent!”

Qiao Nian looked at Qiao Xin, speechless. Qiao Xin still had the cheek to say that Su Xue was innocent. This was simply a huge joke.

Could a mere divorce certificate mean that Su Xue hadn’t cheated on Qiao Shan?

Ridiculous.

Would Qiao Shan forgive Su Xue now?

He wouldn’t.

Qiao Shan yearned for Su Xue to be punished.

Qiao Nian saw Qiao Shan walking out of the room, his face blank.
