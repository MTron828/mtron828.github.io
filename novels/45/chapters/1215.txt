1216 Disappointment

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he thought of their third child and hurriedly gestured. “She still has our most important treasure.”

Qiao Nian knew in her heart that if she found that woman, she would find their third child. She hesitated.

However, before Qiao Nian could speak, Lu Jiang said, “We’ve already found clues about those three people.”

“Where are they now?” Jiang Chi looked away from Qiao Nian’s face and asked Lu Jiang anxiously. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Someone in the company recognized the three of them. This woman in the middle has already passed away from bone cancer. One of the other two has been sent to Country M, and the other is in MY. I’ll send you their information now.” Lu Jiang’s fingers quickly swiped across the phone screen.

The four of them had a group. Lu Jiang sent the message to the group, and everyone opened the document.

The woman who worked for Country M was called Wang Tian. She was 26 years old this year and had grown up in the United States. One of her parents was a physics professor, and the other was a chemistry professor. They both taught at a university.

Her parents had not returned since they left the country thirty years ago.

Wang Tian had returned to the country to work after graduating from university because her grandmother, who had once taken care of her, had already returned to the country. She wanted to return to the country to take care of her grandmother.

There was also a photo of Wang Tian on the document. Wang Tian looked sweet, and when she smiled, she had two deep dimples.

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze slightly. If she remembered correctly, Song Man should be that woman’s biological daughter.

Qiao Nian took out Song Man’s photo. If Wang Tian was really related to that woman, she should look a little similar.

When she compared the photos of the two of them, she realized that Song Man’s appearance was completely different from Wang Tian’s. It seemed that Wang Tian might not have anything to do with the kidnapping more than twenty years ago.

Qiao Nian read the information of the other person.

Su Li was thirty years old this year and was a local of An City. Her parents ran a small supermarket and their family conditions were average. They also had a brother.

At the beginning of last year, Su Li’s brother had bought a house in the city center of An City and paid a down payment of 30%. This 30% down payment was also partly from relatives and friends.

Qiao Nian compared Su Li’s photo with Song Man’s. There was almost nothing similar about the two of them.

Qiao Nian read Su Li and Wang Tian’s information repeatedly. Although they looked nothing alike to Song Man, she couldn’t be sure that these two people were unrelated to the kidnapping twenty years ago.

Wang Tian had lived in the United States since she was young and her family was well-off. Although there was no record of her parents entering the country at the customs, their family was qualified to do what they did back then.

Su Li’s parents had always lived in An City. Their family conditions didn’t seem good, but they had time to execute the plan back then.

Qiao Nian looked at Lu Jiang and asked, “Does the woman standing in the middle have any photos and information about her?”

“I’ll get her information too.” As Lu Jiang spoke, he sent another document to the group.

Qiao Nian opened the document.

Li Yang had died of bone cancer at the age of 30. She was an orphan and had grown up in an orphanage.

“None of these three have a motive.” Jiang Chi frowned at these files and said unhappily, “Could it be that my brother wasn’t looking at the three of them?”

“Are there any more surveillance videos from back then?” Qiao Nian felt that if she could see the surveillance videos back then, she might be able to discover who Jiang Cheng had been secretly following.

“I’ve already gotten someone to look for the surveillance video from back then.” Jiang Chi paused for a moment and continued, “This photo was screenshotted from the surveillance cameras. Logically speaking, it should be very easy to find.”

Holding her phone, Qiao Nian prepared to use her hacking skills to investigate the three women.

What they were seeing now was all the information the company had gathered. Perhaps this information had been tampered with.
