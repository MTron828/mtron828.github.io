754 Will You Not Want Zhou Zhou?

Gu Zhou reached out and hugged Qiao Nian. Sensing the warmth from Qiao Nian, his uneasiness gradually dissipated, leaving only peace in his heart.

After a long while, he looked up at Qiao Nian. There were still tears on his long eyelashes, and his voice was a little nasal. “Nian Nian, will you leave Zhou Zhou behind in the future too? Will you not want Zhou Zhou?”

Also…

Qiao Nian recalled that Gu Zhou had been born to be a medicinal source. His parents didn’t really like him.

Who would want to experience such a life?

It wasn’t just once.

Even the strongest person would probably feel helpless and in pain.

She recalled how Gu Zhou had driven many tanks to look for her in MY.

At that time, he was standing on a tank. The breeze blew his windbreaker, and he looked extremely handsome.

In her heart, she had never expected Gu Zhou to have such a fragile side.

If Matriarch Gu had not said so, she would never have dared to imagine how bitter his life had been in the past.

As long as Gu Zhou was afraid, sad, or felt that he was about to be abandoned, Zhou Zhou would appear.

At this moment, Gu Zhou didn’t hear Qiao Nian’s words. After a long while, he said, “If Nian Nian really doesn’t want Zhou Zhou, can Nian Nian leave secretly? Not in front of Zhou Zhou, okay?”

Qiao Nian really couldn’t bear to part with him. If Gu Qi was the child of Gu Zhou and the child he had once loved, she might have held a grudge, but Gu Qi had only been schemed against. Gu Zhou wasn’t to blame for this, nor was Gu Qi’s mother. Those who schemed against them were the ones who should be blamed.

How could she bear to blame Gu Zhou for someone else’s mistake?

Qiao Nian pursed her lips and said, “No, Nian Nian will accompany Zhou Zhou. She won’t leave.”

Even if she had to leave in the future, she had to treat Gu Zhou’s illness.

“Really?” He stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian nodded. “Really. I won’t lie to you.”

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian and gently rested his head on her shoulder. Gradually, he fell asleep.

Although he didn’t want to sleep and didn’t want Qiao Nian to leave him, he was too sleepy now. He couldn’t open his eyes no matter what.

Qiao Nian gently patted his back. Seeing that he had fallen asleep, she placed him on the sofa.

She pulled a small blanket over and covered him with it.

Qiao Nian sat at the side and looked at him, still frowning in his sleep. It was as if he was having a nightmare.

Qiao Nian patted his body gently and comforted him. “Zhou Zhou, sleep. Don’t worry. I’ll stay here with you.”

In his sleep, Gu Zhou seemed to have heard Qiao Nian’s voice. His brow gradually relaxed, and his breathing became long and even.

Seeing this, Qiao Nian knew that Gu Zhou had already fallen asleep.

Qiao Nian slowly retracted her hand, staring unblinkingly at Gu Zhou.

…

At this moment.

Gu Qi was playing games alone in his room. Just as he finished one round, a message suddenly jumped out.

“Brother Xiao Qi!”

When Gu Qi saw these words, his lips curved up slightly. He seemed to have thought of something and sent a message. “Yes!”

“Brother Xiao Qi, can I look for you? I want to see you!”

When Gu Qi saw this, he hesitated for a moment before sending a message.

“How will you come to find me?”

“I’ve been working hard to save money. Now that I’ve saved enough, I can buy a bus ticket and take a taxi to look for you!”

Gu Qi’s frown deepened. His grip on the phone tightened involuntarily. “You’re still so young. You can’t go far alone.”

“Brother Xiao Qi, you don’t have to worry about me. I just wanted to ask if you were willing to see me.”

Xiao Qi’s eyes gradually became firm. “I am!”

The other party immediately sent a happy emoji. After saying goodbye, he went offline.

Gu Qi looked at that person’s profile picture and gradually fell into deep thought.

Gu Qi lowered his gaze slightly. He had known Xiao Shi for a long time. Previously, when he was playing games, he wanted to get first place in the national server. As his level was about the same as hers when he was young, he often bumped into her.

After a while, the two of them became familiar with each other. To be precise, they got to know each other without fighting. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

They were all junglers. There was once when Xiao Shi wanted to send a voice message, and she accidentally sent it out.

At that time, he realized that Xiao Shi was about his age.
