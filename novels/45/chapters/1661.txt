Chapter 1662 Found It

Qiao Nian's hand, which was combing her hair, paused for a moment. She looked at Lina worriedly and nodded gently. "A lot."

Lina smiled and nodded. She said softly, "That's good. If anything happens, I'll definitely make them regret it for the rest of their lives."

After saying this, Chen Qing's face appeared in Lina's mind.

Chen Qing, he…

When Lina thought of how Chen Qing didn't like her, her heart still ached.

However, she was still very glad that Chen Qing didn't like her. If Chen Qing liked her, he would have to watch her marry Wright. That should be very painful for Chen Qing.

She would bear all the pain alone.

At this moment, the banquet hall was overcrowded.

The marriage of the Seventh Princess of the royal family and Mark's adopted son, Wright, was a huge matter for many people, so they rushed over.

The president greeted the various factions naturally. After greeting them, he sat alone by the window and drank slowly.

His attention was fixed on the guests. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

On the surface, everyone was here to congratulate the host on the joyous occasion of every banquet, but in reality, it was an exchange of benefits. All the collaborations were done in private.

He wanted to take the opportunity to investigate who was already Mark's subordinate and who was worth fighting for.

In the garden outside the banquet hall, Gu Zhou was holding a glass of red wine. He walked around slowly, carefully observing his surroundings.

He still had his earpiece in his ear, and Chen Qing's deep voice came through.

"Second Young Master, I've already observed the topographic map of Mark's residence, and I've already understood the exact location of the guards. The topographic map we obtained previously is outdated. He's already expanded the place a lot. I've already sent a new blueprint to your phone."

When Gu Zhou heard Chen Qing's words, he nodded in a low voice. He avoided the cameras and turned on his phone to take a closer look. He said in a low voice, "The woman beside Mark hasn't appeared. Looks like she's hiding. However, she's definitely not in a room on the surface. She should be in a more secretive place."

Gu Zhou recalled what the president had said. Song Qin used to be by his side, but later on, she gradually faded from everyone's sight.

Initially, the president thought that Song Qin had left Mark. Later on, the president accidentally bumped into Mark and Song Qin hugging.

Gu Zhou looked at the map on his phone carefully. His expression turned serious as he said in a low voice, "I found it."

All large families would build basements. The basement was a secret place to hide important people and things.

Gu Zhou had once studied architecture. According to a designer's train of thought, he could quickly discover the entrance to the basement.

The dark clouds pressed down, giving off a strong sense of oppression. The originally lively garden gradually quietened down, and everyone walked into the banquet hall.

People came and went in the banquet hall under the lights. Everyone had happy smiles on their faces, as if they were really happy because of the two people who were about to get married.

At this moment, the center of attention was none other than Mark. Mark had a bright smile on his face as he clinked glasses with everyone and politely received their wishes.

As for the president, he sat alone at the bar. There was no one around. It was as if no one wanted to get close to the president in front of Mark. After all, the president was just a decoration, and Mark had real power.

The president sat at the side with a dark expression, as if he was extremely dissatisfied that his daughter had been forced to marry Wright.

Just as the representatives of the various countries arrived, the president put down his wine glass. A trace of coldness flashed in his eyes. The show had begun.

The president spoke into his headset. "It's almost time to start. It's time to get ready."

Chen Qing had been checking on the guards of Mark's manor. When he heard the president's words, he replied in a low voice, "Okay."

Gu Zhou avoided the attention of the cameras and guards and went straight to the entrance of the basement. Smelling the faint fragrance inside, a glint flashed in his eyes.

"I've already found it. It's here." Gu Zhou placed a locator in a corner, thinking of coming over with Qiao Nian later.
