Chapter 655: Are You Questioning Me?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Seeing that Qiao Nian was ignoring her, Su Sheng frowned slightly. She took a step forward and asked, “Miss Qiao, why are you ignoring me when I’m talking to you? Don’t you know that this is very rude?”

Qiao Nian was already terrified and uneasy. She felt a little uncomfortable because of Lu Nian’s attitude towards her.

Now that she heard Su Sheng’s unreasonable words, she recalled how Su Sheng had bragged in front of her. Her eyes instantly turned cold. “Are you questioning me?”

When Su Sheng heard Qiao Nian’s cold voice, she instantly understood something.

Qiao Nian was really Mr. Dong Hua.

Su Sheng’s heart gradually sank to the bottom.

Seeing Su Sheng like this, Gu Qing hurriedly stepped forward and pulled her aside, saying in a low voice, “You’ve misunderstood. Miss Qiao isn’t Mr. Dong Hua. Actually, Mr. Dong Hua is…”

“She isn’t Mr. Dong Hua?” Su Sheng interrupted Gu Qing mercilessly, asking impatiently. A trace of joy flashed in her eyes.

“Yes.” Gu Qing nodded.

When Su Sheng heard this, her lips curved up slightly in a happy smile.

So Qiao Nian wasn’t Mr. Dong Hua.

She had asked Qiao Nian this question just now, but Qiao Nian didn’t want to answer. This meant that Qiao Nian still wanted to pretend to be Mr. Dong Hua. Qiao Nian was truly shameless.

Someone as immoral as Qiao Nian was not worthy of playing the piano in Mr. Dong Hua’s piano room. This was simply a stain on Mr. Dong Hua’s piano.

Although she had yet to meet Mr. Dong Hua, she would never allow Qiao Nian to act wantonly in Mr. Dong Hua’s music room.

Su Sheng’s expression also turned cold. She raised her eyebrows slightly and questioned, “You’ve trespassed on Mr. Dong Hua’s territory without his permission and used his piano without his permission. Previously, you told me that you were also a fan of Mr. Dong Hua. How can a fan do such a thing? Are you an extreme fan of Mr. Dong Hua?”

When Qiao Nian heard Su Sheng’s words, she clenched her fists tightly, then let go weakly.

Actually, she didn’t care what outsiders thought of her. What she cared about the most was what Second Brother thought of her.

Was Second Brother really so angry just because she had privately played her piano?

Seeing that Qiao Nian wasn’t looking at her, Su Sheng frowned and questioned, “Qiao Nian, did you hear me?”

Gu Qing tugged at Su Sheng’s sleeve and whispered, “What are you doing?”

Just as Su Sheng was about to speak, she heard Gu Qing say, “Didn’t you want to reconcile with Miss Qiao?”

“Senior Sister, it was clearly Qiao Nian who casually touched Mr. Dong Hua’s piano,” Su Sheng said unhappily. She even looked at Qiao Nian. Seeing Qiao Nian’s cold expression, the more she thought about it, the angrier she became.

“Alright, stop talking. Even if Mr. Dong Hua is unhappy because Miss Qiao touched the piano, this is still Mr. Dong Hua’s business. Don’t interfere anymore!”

Gu Qing gave Su Sheng a silent look.

Su Sheng lowered her head reluctantly, biting her lip.

She just couldn’t stand Qiao Nian’s aloofness. Moreover, Qiao Nian had casually touched Mr. Dong Hua’s things. This in itself was an insult to Mr. Dong Hua.

Gu Qing walked up with a smile, breaking the awkward silence. She smiled at Qiao Nian and asked, “Miss Qiao, you were also invited by Ah Nian, right?”

Ah Nian?

Could it be Mr. Dong Hua’s real name? Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Could it be that Mr. Dong Hua had really invited Qiao Nian?

How was that possible? Qiao Nian was just a female musician Mr. Dong Hua had hired at the last minute.

Su Sheng’s face instantly turned pale. Subconsciously, she refused to believe this.

Su Sheng took a step forward and grabbed Gu Qing’s arm. “Senior Sister, how is that possible? Qiao Nian is just…”

“Alright, stop talking.” Gu Qing interrupted Su Sheng sternly.

Su Sheng shrank back and stood there silently, not saying anything else.

Only then did Gu Qing retract her gaze. Her gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face and she said with a smile, “I’m sorry, Su Sheng was so agitated just now because she liked Mr. Dong Hua too much. Just now, we were outside. When we heard the piano, we thought that Ah Nian was playing it. When she walked in, she realized that it wasn’t Mr. Dong Hua playing. For a moment, she couldn’t accept the reality, so she spoke rudely.”
