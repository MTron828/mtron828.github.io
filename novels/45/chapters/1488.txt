Wright watched as she left and his eyes darkened.

At that time, he understood that whether it was supporting the first earl to become the president or protecting the glory of the first earl’s residence, the ultimate beneficiary was Annie, because Annie was the only daughter of the first earl.

Previously, he thought that if the First Earl really ascended to the throne, his status would indeed rise. However, in reality? He had worked so hard just to benefit Annie.

Annie, on the other hand, was a sharp person. She quickly discovered his intentions.

However, the first earl was unwilling to let Annie do those things. In his opinion, Annie should inherit the throne or the earldom cleanly.

Wright’s frown deepened. Although he had done these dirty jobs, he was also accumulating his abilities. If the First Earl really valued Annie, then there would be no place for him in the First Earl’s residence in the future.

With that thought in mind, Wright turned into the room, closing the door behind him.

He took out his phone and called the daughter of the Third Earl, the Fourth Princess, Aisha.

The call went through very quickly.

“Brother Wright, you didn’t even eat with me last night. I don’t care. You have to eat with me today to compensate for my broken heart yesterday.” Aisha’s delicate voice came through the cell phone.

Wright’s frown deepened, but his voice was gentle. “I took a call last night at the last minute. I had something to do, so I couldn’t eat with you. I want to treat you to a good meal!”

Wright thought again of the girl he had seen last night. The girl was called Nana. She really looked like Lina. He recalled how Nana felt in bed. His bad mood improved.

It was almost noon, and he no longer planned to rest. If he rested any longer, it wouldn’t be long before he would be chased out!

“Alright, then I’ll wait for you at home to pick me up!” Aisha’s happy voice came through the phone.

Wright’s eyes were cold. Someone like Aisha was too easy to coax and control!

After hanging up, Wright looked out of the window with a bloodthirsty expression. From afar, he saw Annie driving away. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He turned around and walked in. The window frame he had touched left five distinct finger marks.

…

About ten minutes later, the room finally quietened down.

Dr. Ollie glanced at Qiao Nian and said, “Madam Gu, wait a moment. I’ll go in and take a look.”

Qiao Nian nodded slightly. She glanced at Gu Zhou and gave him a reassuring look. “This is Madam President’s room. It’s not convenient for you to enter. I’ll go in myself.”

Qiao Nian followed Dr. Ollie in. Just now, Dr. Ollie had already explained Mrs President’s basic situation. When she walked into the room, she saw that the ground was in a mess.

Not far away, a vase had shattered on the ground. On some of the fragments, blood could still be seen.

Qiao Nian glanced around and saw that all the corners of the tables on the furniture were round. Not only that, but some places were also wrapped in foam.

Dr. Ollie looked at the broken vase on the ground and sighed helplessly. He said in a low voice, “The president has already put away everything that might hurt Madam President. If Madam President didn’t like vases, the president wouldn’t have left them behind.”

Dr. Ollie paused and sighed helplessly. “But Madam President’s illness flared up. She couldn’t control herself and cut her wrist with a fragment of the vase.”

Qiao Nian frowned, her expression serious. Madam President would commit suicide when her illness flared up?

She finally understood why the president had renovated this house into a safe room.

“Fortunately, the president stopped Madam just now,” Ollie said safely. If the president had been a step later, wouldn’t Madam have…
