1274 Worried

After a long while, Xiao Bao let go of Mr. Chen’s body and kissed him on the cheek. Then, he said, “Doesn’t Daddy love Xiao Bao the most?”

When Mr. Chen heard Xiao Bao’s words, his eyes turned slightly red. He hugged Xiao Bao in his arms, unwilling to let him see his face.

His low and hoarse voice was filled with helplessness. “As a child of the Gu family, you might lose your life at any time.”

Xiao Bao didn’t know Mr. Chen’s current expression. He grabbed his clothes and said softly, “Daddy, I’m not afraid. With you around, I’m not afraid of anything!”

Mr. Chen’s arms tightened involuntarily, and his throat choked. “But I’m afraid I can’t protect you.”

“Daddy, you really don’t have to worry. Brother Xiao Qi and Sister Xiao Shi are also alive and well. They’re both children of the Gu family. I’m also a child of the Gu family and I’m fine now. Daddy is already very powerful!” Xiao Bao said in a childish voice.

When Mr. Chen heard Xiao Bao’s words, he let go of him and looked into his eyes. He explained seriously, “Xiao Qi and Xiao Shi are alive and well because outsiders don’t know of their existence.”

Xiao Bao blinked in confusion.

Mr. Chen continued, “Xiao Qi has always been hidden by your father. No one knows of his existence, and Xiao Shi lived outside because someone knows that she’s a child of the Gu family. She lived a hard life for so many years. If your mommy and daddy hadn’t discovered them in time, Xiao Shi might have continued to suffer!”

He knew in his heart that those people would not let the Gu family’s children off, let alone let the Gu family have an easy time.

It was precisely because he was standing in the mud that he knew how turbid the water in the mud was.

Xiao Bao looked at Mr. Chen, not fully understanding. He pursed his lips slightly, as if he had made up his mind. He said very bravely, “Daddy, I’m still very happy that I’m a child of the Gu family. I’m even happier to have a father like you by my side. I’ve enjoyed Daddy’s love, and I’ll work hard to bear the responsibility of being a child of the Gu family. Daddy, I’m very brave. I’m definitely not afraid of bad people. Even if there are bad people, I’ll use the marksmanship you taught me to hit them, chase them away, and protect you!”

When Mr. Chen heard Xiao Bao’s words, there was a trace of a smile in his eyes. His lips curved up slightly. “Daddy will also work hard to protect you.”

Xiao Bao’s smile was especially bright. There were two deep dimples on the side of his face, and his eyes were curved into crescents.

“Since you’re already a man, acknowledge your mommy!” Mr. Chen said.

When Xiao Bao heard Mr. Chen’s words, a trace of surprise flashed in his eyes. Soon, the light in his eyes grew brighter and brighter. He asked happily, “Daddy, can I really?”

Mr. Chen nodded.

Xiao Bao kissed Mr. Chen’s cheek excitedly and said happily, “Thank you, Daddy.”

Mr. Chen looked at Xiao Bao in his arms and said gently, “Don’t acknowledge your mommy tonight. When you see her later, you can acknowledge her, okay?”

Xiao Bao thought about how he had already waited for five years. A few more days wouldn’t make a difference. He nodded excitedly. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

With that, Mr. Chen looked at Chang Feng beside him and said, “Go and make an appointment later to bring Xiao Bao to them!”

When Chang Feng heard Mr. Chen’s words, his face turned pale. He looked at the elated Xiao Bao, and his heart felt empty.

However, Chang Feng knew in his heart that he did not know how long this farewell would take to come.

Chang Feng still replied, “Yes.” Then, he went out to settle this matter.

Mr. Chen sat on the sofa and watched as Xiao Bao jumped up and down happily. His eyes were a little dazed, and his eyes were a little wet.

Xiao Bao ran to his phone and turned it on again. This time, the phone could be turned on. He logged back into the game and realized that his mommy, brother, and sister had already gone offline.

Coincidentally, he wanted to train his gaming skills when they were not around so he could play games with them in the future.

Xiao Bao sat on a small stool in front of the table and began to play again.

Mr. Chen sat there and looked at Xiao Bao’s back, his eyes filled with reluctance.
