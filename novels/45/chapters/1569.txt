1570 I Don’t Believe You
A gentle smile appeared on Qiao Nian’s face. She said lightly, “What if there are witnesses?”

“Witnesses?” Annie raised her eyebrows slightly and asked, “How can there be witnesses?”

“Huo Qi.”

“That’s impossible!” Without hesitation, Annie shook her head in objection and said loudly, “That’s absolutely impossible.”

“Who said that it’s impossible?” Qiao Nian’s voice was as calm as before, and her eyes narrowed slightly. “Annie, how do you think we knew that you had leaked the news? Could it be by a guess?”Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Annie’s expression changed slightly, and her body swayed a little. However, she quickly regained her composure and said, “Are you lying to me?”

“No.” Qiao Nian’s lips curved up slightly, and her gaze fell on Annie’s face. “I’m just here to admire the tragic state of a defeated opponent. Otherwise, I’m worried that I won’t be able to see you again after the court session.”

Were they going to court already?

Annie was slightly stunned. Qiao Nian’s words made her wary. She frowned at Qiao Nian. “What do you mean?”

“General Cui has already told us everything about you, leaving no big or small detail. Moreover, he’s preparing to testify against you. The President has long tidied up all the information. When we get to court, you might be shot on the spot, so I might never see you again.”

Qiao Nian pursed her lips slightly and glanced at Annie’s current state. “I think there’s nothing left of a person when she dies. It’s too much suffering to live, but it seems that everyone in the world thinks that death is the greatest punishment.”

Annie could no longer hear Qiao Nian. Her mind was filled with Qiao Nian’s words. It was as if an invisible hand was holding her neck tightly. She was suffocating to the point of death.

Cui Qi.

How could Cui Qi dare to accuse her?

The president was very daring now. Now, he actually dared to send her to court.

Annie’s frown deepened. Could it be that her father had really given up on her this time?

Previously, her father had announced to the outside world that he wanted to sever their father-daughter relationship. She knew that those were all her father’s stalling tactics and a compromise he had made to temporarily consolidate his power.

If she were in her father’s shoes, for the sake of the greater good, she would make the same choice.

Previously, she had contacted Cui Qi and asked him to kidnap Lina and assassinate Qiao Nian. Cui Qi must have told her father, which meant that her father also wanted to get her out of the interrogation room by capturing Lina.

But now, Cui Qi had actually betrayed her. Could it be that her father had instructed Cui Qi to do that?

In order to deal with the situation, her father had pushed all the blame to her. That way, her father would not be hurt at all.

That wasn’t right.

Something was wrong.

Annie staggered two steps and leaned her back against the wall. Her mind raced. She had never been so unclear about her fate. She pursed her lips and looked into the distance with dark eyes.

Cui Qi was the most powerful general in Europe. There were probably not many people in this world who could defeat him.

Cui Qi had actually been caught.

Had he really been caught?

Or could it be that her father had deliberately gotten someone to capture Cui Qi so that he could accuse her? Therefore, her father had never thought of saving her from the beginning. Her father wanted him to die!

At the thought, Annie’s legs gave way and she fell to the ground. She clutched her chest, breathing hard. Tears fell uncontrollably.

Qiao Nian stood there calmly. She looked at Annie and raised her eyebrows slightly. Now, Annie’s inner defense was as thin as a piece of paper, ready to be pierced at any moment.
If she wanted to convict Mark, she could only use the testimony of a heavyweight.

Annie was the knife in Mark’s hand. It was also a knife that could be stabbed at Mark.

Qiao Nian said unhurriedly, “If you want to live, there’s a way.”

Annie snorted and looked at Qiao Nian with tears streaming down her face. “Stop pretending. You can’t wait for me to die.”

“I’ve said it before. I prefer to see someone lose their freedom if they live. I hope you can live well.” Qiao Nian paused. “However, you look like you want to live.”
