1350 I’ll Wait For You

“His situation is very safe now. If I meet him by bringing up the collaboration, I might…”

However, before Gu Zhou could finish speaking, Qiao Nian interrupted him.

Qiao Nian knew very well that Gu Zhou had always wanted to find Gu Yue. She also understood that Gu Yue was very important to Gu Zhou.

“You’ll disrupt all his plans. Come back quickly. The children are still in danger. I still want to make a trip to Europe.” It wasn’t convenient for Qiao Nian to make it too clear over the phone, so she said ambiguously.

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he was a little puzzled. Puzzled, he asked, “Why are you going to Europe?”

“My parents found out that my kidnapping back then was related to Europe.” Qiao Nian sighed helplessly and said softly, “It’s very complicated. The kidnapping back then didn’t seem to be as simple as we thought. I want to go over and take a look to see if I can find any other clues.”

“Yes, I’ll go back as soon as possible.”

“Alright, I’ll wait for you.” Qiao Nian smiled and agreed. Just as she was about to hang up, she heard Gu Zhou’s hesitant voice.

“Um…”

“What’s wrong?” Qiao Nian asked in confusion.

“Nian’er.”

Every time Gu Zhou called her “Nian’er”, his voice rose slightly. It had a hint of temptation and made her heart skip a beat.

“I’m here.”

“Do you miss me?”

Gu Zhou’s cold and aggrieved voice came from the cell phone. Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but blush. She gripped her cell phone tightly, thinking about how to answer.

“Don’t you?”

His voice seemed to have some kind of magic, and Qiao Nian couldn’t bear to refuse.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips and took a deep breath. She quickly said, “I do!”

With that, she hung up without waiting for Gu Zhou to speak.

Just as Gu Zhou was about to say something, he noticed that she had already hung up. His phoenix-like eyes were filled with smiles.

He knew that Qiao Nian was easily shy. It was as if he could see the shy Qiao Nian standing in front of him.

Gu Zhou thought of Qiao Nian’s slightly red face, and his eyes gradually filled with lust. He tried hard to remain calm and try not to think about Qiao Nian, calming the lust in his body.

After a while, Gu Zhou’s eyes instantly turned cold.

Previously, Qiao Nian had even asked Fourth Brother Lu to bring Xiao Bao back to the country first. She would accompany him in MY. After he recovered, the two of them were supposed to go home together.

However, all of this had been ruined by that person.

Gu Zhou picked up his phone again and called that person’s contact with a cold gaze.

The other party picked up very quickly.

“Ah Zhou?”

A gentle female voice came through the phone. There seemed to be a hint of surprise in her voice.

Bai Hui glanced at her cell phone and was certain that it was Gu Zhou. Just as she was about to speak, she heard Gu Zhou’s cold voice coming from the cell phone.

“Yes.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

When Bai Hui heard Gu Zhou’s voice, she clenched her fists slightly.

Ever since Gu Zhou returned to the Gu family villa, he had not called her again.

It was rare for him to take the initiative to call. Bai Hui hesitated for a moment before saying, “Ah Zhou, you called…”

“I want to trouble you with something.”

Before Bai Hui could finish speaking, she was interrupted by Gu Zhou’s cold voice. Before she could speak, she heard Gu Zhou continue.

“Don’t disturb my wife and children anymore. Stay away from them. Otherwise, don’t blame me for disregarding our blood ties.”

Bai Hui was stunned. Then, her expression instantly darkened and she pursed her lips.

Gu Zhou’s words pierced through her heart like a cold blade. She was his biological mother, but he described their relationship as having “blood ties”.

Bai Hui’s eyes were as cold as ice. She returned to her usual cold self and said sarcastically, “Did you call just for such an insignificant thing?”

“Don’t do the insignificant thing I’m talking about again. I’ll only say this one last time.”

Bai Hui’s eyes gradually turned red.

Even if her words were unpleasant, Gu Zhou’s words to her were so cold and ruthless, as if she was not his mother.
