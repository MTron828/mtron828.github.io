For some reason, Qiao Nian was a little excited. Although she rarely had time to play this game, she was still second in the national server. When the time came, she could tell her son, “You have a mother who’s second in the national server. Are you happy?”

Those who played this game especially admired the national server.

Although she was only second in the national server and was slightly inferior to the first in the national server, she was second only to one person. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

She could imagine Gu Qi’s cold face filled with admiration.

Gu Zhou sat down beside Qiao Nian. Seeing Qiao Nian’s excited expression, he frowned slightly.

He was busy with the company every day. If he had time, he would deal with family matters and take care of Gu Qi. Playing games was a waste of time for him. It was meaningless.

Moreover, facing the phone screen for a long time would damage his health and be bad for his eyes.

He knew in his heart that Gu Qi was a child. It was fine for him to play games occasionally, but he would not allow Gu Qi to play games for a long time, let alone join him.

As parents, what if their children were addicted to games and couldn’t extricate themselves?

With this thought in mind, Gu Zhou asked, “Aren’t you worried that Gu Qi will continue to play games and be unwilling to study?”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, her eyes were filled with surprise. Smiling, she explained, “He has always played Honor of Kings and I’ve never seen him unwilling to study. You heard it just now. The two of them are going to study. Playing games is just a form of rest for them.”

She paused for a moment and continued, “Moreover, this game can stimulate our brains. It’s fine for Xiao Qi to play it. This game has a lot of freedom and can fully utilize his imagination. Isn’t that good?”

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian’s beautiful face, then his gaze fell on her chattering red lips. He moved closer to Qiao Nian’s lips and planted a gentle kiss. His lips curved up slightly. “Yes.”

He thought of his childhood again.

When he was young, he liked to play with building blocks, but his mother said that building blocks were something only good-for-nothing children would play with. She would only throw him exercise books to do questions.

When he was in school, he looked at his classmates’ game consoles and was also very envious. He used his pocket money to buy a game console. He had only played one round, but he was already first in his class.

Later on, his mother found the game console in his school bag. She took the game console directly to the courtyard and smashed it into pieces with a hammer in front of him.

He remembered it very clearly, but that was what his mother had said.

“Only a loser would play games. Smart people have already begun to play games in reality!”

It was at that moment that he understood that only incompetent people would play those virtual games.

This society was a role-playing game to begin with. What he had to do was to accumulate wealth for his family.

Therefore, in his opinion, a virtual game was only played by a useless person.

If only.

At that time, if his mother could think like Qiao Nian, his life might have been more colorful. He wouldn’t have led such a boring life.

Gu Zhou smiled at Qiao Nian and nodded. “Okay.”

Qiao Nian smiled. Without a word, she began to search for the address of the game ID.

When she found out that the login address of the game ID was MY, her expression changed. Her beautiful fox-like eyes narrowed dangerously.

According to Gu Qi and Xiao Shi, this person first added Gu Qi. After being rejected by Gu Qi, he added Xiao Shi. In other words, this person knew Gu Qi and Xiao Shi’s game ID.

Who exactly had deliberately registered an account and added her two children?

What exactly was this person’s motive?

Qiao Nian recalled that she had been kidnapped back then. She didn’t know what motives the people who had kidnapped her had. At that time, she had asked around. She was originally playing at home. Later on, no one knew when she had left the house. When the Lu family noticed that she had disappeared, they had already sealed off the surroundings of the Lu family villa.

Could it be that someone had begun to use the Internet to abduct people?
