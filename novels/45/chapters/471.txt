Qiao Nian took a closer look. The nurse was right. Her blood had undergone hemolysis with Lu Zhu’s.

The chief surgeon was also puzzled. In theory, people of the same blood type usually wouldn’t have hemolysis. He looked at Qiao Nian in surprise and asked, “Doctor Qiao, did you remember your blood type wrongly?”

After the chief surgeon finished speaking, he couldn’t help but laugh. A doctor actually remembered her own blood type wrongly.

However, as the chief surgeon smiled, his smile froze. Logically speaking, it was impossible for a doctor to remember the blood type wrongly!

Hence, the doctor frowned and looked at Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian’s lips trembled slightly, and her breathing quickened. “I’m sure. I have Type A blood.”

Seeing Qiao Nian like this, the chief surgeon was surprised. He had a bold thought, but he didn’t say anything.

The nurse standing at the side was more innocent. She said in surprise, “Doctor Qiao, are you and Mr. Lu direct relatives?”

When the nurse finished, she was stunned herself.

One had to know that Doctor Qiao was an outstanding doctor. She was definitely more knowledgeable than him. How could she not know that immediate family members were not allowed to donate blood?

Unless.

Unless Doctor Qiao did not know that Mr. Lu was her family member.

Qiao Nian’s eyes reddened involuntarily, and tears welled up in her eyes. She turned to look at Lu Zhu, who was lying on the bed, her eyes filled with mixed emotions.

Her heart was beating quickly. She finally understood why she had a strange feeling when she first saw Lu Zhu.

Moreover, every time she saw Lu Zhu, she couldn’t help but want to get close to him. Even though Lu Zhu was fierce to her, she still couldn’t help but approach him.

She also knew very well that she did not have any romantic feelings for Lu Zhu. She just wanted to get close to him.

She finally understood all of this now.

She and he were related by blood, and should still be blood relatives within three generations.

However, there were so many people in the Lu family. She and Lu Zhu might be related by blood or connected to a family branch.

From the looks of it, she should be from the Lu family.

However, her relationship with Lu Zhu could only be confirmed after a DNA test.

However, before all of this was investigated, this matter could not be made public. Otherwise, there would be some trouble.

However, Qiao Nian now had a strange feeling.

For some reason, she suddenly remembered what Su Xue had once said, and her body turned cold.

Su Xue had once said that her mother was an unpresentable mistress, a mistress of a wealthy businessman.

However, the rich businessman had left heartlessly because her mother had given birth to a daughter. Her mother had abandoned her resentfully and ran away.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips slightly. For some reason, she was reminded of Lu Qi, who had been doted on by the Lu family.

Could it be that she was really the illegitimate daughter of one of the Lu family members?

However, the Lu family seemed to be very loyal. Logically speaking, they shouldn’t have done such a thing.

Qiao Nian was a little confused, and her emotions became complicated.

At this moment, the nurse realized that she had done something wrong. She seemed to have said something she shouldn’t have.

Qiao Nian tried her best to calm herself down, and her emotions became complicated. Her voice was a little hoarse as she said word by word, “I hope that no one will say anything about what happened in the operating theater. I’ll give everyone two million yuan. However, if anyone tells anyone else, then…”

After saying that, Qiao Nian swept her gaze across the crowd, her eyes instantly turning cold, as if threatening everyone present. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

When everyone heard Qiao Nian’s words, they looked extremely afraid, but they were still happy in their hearts. After all, that was two million yuan. They had worked for ten years, but they had never saved so much money!

They had become rich overnight!
