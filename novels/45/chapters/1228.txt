1229 Why?

She had once seen a photo of Gu Yue. In the photo, Gu Yue’s eyes were cold, completely different from Mr. Chen’s.

Mr. Chen looked like he had gone through hardship but his eyes were the same. He did not look like a young man in his twenties at all.

What exactly had happened to Gu Yue back then?

Why had his temperament and gaze changed so much?

However, from another perspective, if Gu Yue didn’t disguise himself properly, he wouldn’t have been able to hide for so long.

Chang Feng looked at Qiao Nian and frowned. With a serious expression, he said, “Junior Sister, you must not go this weekend!”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. Puzzled, she asked, “Why?”

Chang Feng sighed slightly and continued, “The appointment this weekend is an ambush, a treacherous plot. It’s Cui Huai’s scheme against the Gu family. He wants to use this opportunity to kill Gu Zhou and take control of the Gu family. All these years, Gu Yue and I have been staying by Cui Huai’s side to protect the Gu family and Gu Zhou. Cui Huai is very ambitious. Not only does he want the Gu family, but he also wants the Lu family. These things are very complicated. It’s difficult to explain in a few words. You just have to not go.”

Qiao Nian frowned, puzzled.

In Qiao Nian’s opinion, most of Cui Huai’s assets were in MY, and the main assets of the Gu and Lu families were in the country. Logically speaking, Cui Huai shouldn’t attack the Gu and Lu families.

What exactly had gone wrong?

Qiao Nian frowned, wanting to find memories of Cui Huai.

However, before Qiao Nian could think clearly, Chang Feng continued, “If Gu Zhou goes to the appointment this time, he’ll be forcing Master to go against him. Therefore, Master hopes that you can go back as soon as possible. That way, everyone will be fine.”

Chang Feng glanced at his watch and stood up. He continued, “I should go out. It’s getting late. If I leave for too long, the people watching me might notice something wrong with me. Everyone will be in danger. If there’s anything else in the future, I’ll contact you again.”

Today, when she saw Chang Feng walking out, her heart emptied, as if something important was about to disappear. She reached out and grabbed Chang Feng’s arm. “Eldest Senior Brother!”

Chang Feng turned around and saw Qiao Nian’s worried eyes. Qiao Nian’s eyes were very beautiful. When she smiled, they curved into crescents, easily infecting others with her smile.

“Don’t worry, I’ll be fine.” Chang Feng smiled and rubbed Qiao Nian’s head. She was still the little girl from before!

Qiao Nian’s eyes turned even redder. She also knew that she couldn’t ask Eldest Senior Brother to stay any longer. She nodded and said, “Alright, you have to protect yourself. Don’t be injured!”

“Okay!” Chang Feng replied. He turned around and walked out.

Qiao Nian watched as the door of the private room closed. All the strength in her body seemed to have been drained, and she collapsed into her seat. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

She felt terrible. She had a bad feeling.

Although Eldest Senior Brother did not make things clear, she could guess that Eldest Senior Brother and Gu Yue were in a very difficult and dangerous situation.

Qiao Nian wanted to tell Gu Zhou about this as soon as possible. Just as she opened the door of the private room and walked towards the cafe, she was stopped by a man in a suit and leather shoes.

“I’m sorry to disturb you. Are you Miss Qiao Nian?”

Qiao Nian looked at the man in front of her. He looked very polite. She stopped in her tracks and looked at him warily. “Yes, you are…”

“Miss Qiao, Master Jiang has invited you to Ghost City. Are you free?”

Master Jiang?

Could it be Jiang Chi?

A trace of confusion flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes.

When she contacted Jiang Chi, he would usually send her a text. Why would he send someone over?

She looked at the man in front of her carefully. This man looked a little familiar. She should have seen him in the Ghost City.

“I don’t have time,” Qiao Nian refused without hesitation.

Not only did the man not leave, but he also blocked Qiao Nian’s path. He said anxiously, “Miss Qiao, Master Jiang has something urgent to tell you.”
