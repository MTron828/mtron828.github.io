1072 Afraid that you will be bullied

If it weren’t for Qiao Nian, her husband and daughter wouldn’t have been hurt in any way, and her husband wouldn’t have found out that she had cheated on him. Their family would still be living a warm life.

However, Su Xue was not stupid at all. She knew in her heart that even if she rushed up and beat Qiao Nian up now, it would be useless. She would only cause trouble for Qiao Yu!

Su Xue tried hard to suppress her hatred. Only then did she notice that Gu Zhou had also arrived.

Her brow furrowed slightly.

It seemed that Gu Zhou really liked Qiao Nian, this country bumpkin. Otherwise, Gu Zhou wouldn’t have followed her here!

Su Xue quickly walked out. When she saw Xu Qiu’s face, she was momentarily stunned.

When Xu Qiu saw Su Xue coming over, it was as if she had found her backbone. She immediately complained, “Sister Su Xue, look at what kind of girl you’ve raised. I wonder where she found a wild man who dared to hit me. You don’t even know how despicable she is. She seduced her uncle and even my son. In my opinion, a daughter like her, do you still…”

“Chen Qing!” Gu Zhou’s cold voice interrupted Xu Qiu. His tone was filled with dissatisfaction.

“Understood, Second Young Master!” Chen Qing nodded and turned to walk towards the car!

Su Xue was about to smooth things over when she saw Gu Zhou playing with the jade pendant on his thumb. He was exuding a vicious aura!

Su Xue couldn’t help but shiver. Why did she feel that Gu Zhou was preparing to kill someone?

Su Xue recalled Qiao Shan’s broken leg again!

Could it be that Gu Zhou wanted to hit someone!

Realizing this, Su Xue shivered and stood there timidly, not daring to speak!

Xu Qiu frowned when she didn’t hear Su Xue speak!

Previously, she had asked Shen Hao to fight that man. Shen Hao, this coward, turned around and wanted to escape.

Now, she was complaining to Su Xue. Su Xue was pretending to be deaf and mute again!

Xu Qiu really couldn’t understand. Were the two of them stupid? Why were they afraid of that wild girl, Qiao Nian?!

Since the two of them were so useless, she could only do it herself!

With one hand on her waist, Xu Qiu continued to distort the truth. “Qiao Nian, you shameless b*tch. At such a young age, you already know how to seduce my man. If it weren’t for the fact that my man doesn’t like ugly women like you, you might have really succeeded. You still want to be on par with me? Dream on. Go to hell, pfft!”

The more Xu Qiu thought about it, the angrier she became. Her eyes gradually turned cold. “You look like a vixen, and you do things like a vixen. Not only did you seduce my man, but you also want to seduce my son. B*tch, you’re so short of men? Why don’t you just become a prostitute? You can even earn a little money. Then, you won’t have to spend the family’s money!”

Su Xue’s heart jumped to her throat. Xu Qiu was really too bold. Her voice trembled as she said, “Don’t, don’t say anymore!”

Su Xue gave Xu Qiu a crazed look!

However, Xu Qiu couldn’t understand what Su Xue meant at all. She frowned and asked, “Sister Su Xue, is there something wrong with your eyes?”

Su Xue was about to vomit blood. She tried hard to remain calm and said in a low voice, “Alright, stop talking!”

Seeing how timid Su Xue was, Xu Qiu frowned and said disapprovingly, “Sister Su Xue, it’s not that I want to criticize you, but Qiao Nian is your child. A child can’t be doted on blindly. A filial child is brought up with a rod. If you ask me, I’ll beat her up ruthlessly. Then, she’ll never be arrogant again. She’ll be honest and filial to her biological mother. Now that she can hit me, her aunt, she’ll definitely hit you in the future!”

Su Xue’s body trembled slightly. There was no need for this to happen in the future. She had already been beaten up.

However, Su Xue couldn’t tell Xu Qiu this directly. She shook her head and said, “Qiao Nian is a good child. Don’t talk about her anymore!”

Xu Qiu’s head was huge, but it was filled with water. She didn’t realize what Su Xue meant at all.

Shen Hao was still a smart person. The moment he saw Gu Zhou, he knew that this person was either rich or noble. He was not someone people like him could afford to offend! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Then, he realized that Su Xue was also obedient in front of Gu Zhou. He tugged at Xu Qiu’s arm and said in a low voice, “Alright, stop talking now. I’ll take you to the hospital!”
