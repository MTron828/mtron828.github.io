995 Going to School

“Xiao Shi, if you have anything to say, just say it. You don’t have to think too much about it.” Qiao Nian thought that she had to change her over thinking personality. A child should act like a child. She shouldn’t think too much about it.

Sigh, she had to take it slow.

When she came downstairs when she was young, she was also a little conflicted. She was worried that her parents were unwilling to let her study.

She even told her brother her worries.

At that time, her brother had told her, “Sister, don’t worry. Daddy and Mommy will definitely agree!”

“Mommy.” Xiao Shi raised her head, her black grape-sized eyes flickering. She asked softly, “Can I go to school like Brother?”

“Of course you can. Moreover, Mommy has already registered your name. The school is having holidays now. When school starts, Mommy will send you to school with Brother.” Qiao Nian smiled and scratched her little nose.

Xiao Shi’s pupils instantly dilated. She looked at Qiao Nian happily, then nodded vigorously and asked sweetly, “Then can I be in the same class as Brother?”

Qiao Nian smiled and said, “Yes, the two of you will be in the same class!”

Xiao Shi had never expected to have the chance to study. She immediately smiled brightly.

Seeing how happy Xiao Shi was, Qiao Nian gently kissed her cheek.

She hoped that she could be so happy forever.

Xiao Shi hugged Qiao Nian’s neck happily, her eyes filled with gratitude and joy.

Gu Zhou, who was sitting at the side, had a faint smile on his face. He was already studying child psychology and learning how to be a good father.

He didn’t want the two children to have any other setbacks in their childhood. It was fine as long as the two children could grow up happily. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Xiao Shi wheedled at Qiao Nian for a while before remembering that there were guests at home. She stayed in Qiao Nian’s arms and looked at the two of them, asking in a childish voice, “Mommy, are Sister and Brother your friends?”

“Oh my, Xiao Shi’s mouth is so sweet!” Lu Qi had been taking videos of Xiao Shi interacting with Qiao Nian on her phone. She yearned to hug Xiao Shi herself, but she couldn’t. It wouldn’t be good if she frightened Xiao Shi. “Come, let Aunt hug you!”

When Xiao Shi heard the word “Aunt”, she looked up at Qiao Nian. Seeing that Qiao Nian was silent, she looked at Lu Qi seriously again.

When Lu Qi smiled, her beautiful eyes had already curved into crescents, and they seemed to be filled with stars.

Xiao Shi looked at Lu Qi and her smile faltered slightly. She had seen this smile on her mommy’s face before.

“Mommy, is Aunt your biological sister?” Xiao Shi asked excitedly. She had finally discovered a new continent.

“How can you tell?” Qiao Nian didn’t answer directly. Instead, she asked.

“When she smiles, she looks very similar to Mommy. Her eyes are especially similar, and her mouth is especially similar. I heard from others that people who look alike are family,” Xiao Shi analyzed seriously.

Qiao Nian smiled at Xiao Shi and asked gently, “Are you really sure?”

A trace of hesitation flashed across Xiao Shi’s face. She glanced at Lu Qi, then at Qiao Nian, who was smiling. She muttered softly, “But she asked me to call her Aunt. This means that she’s of the same generation as Mommy. Moreover, she’s already so old. It’s impossible for Mommy to give birth to such a big daughter.”

When Qiao Nian heard Xiao Shi’s words, she laughed hysterically.

Lu Qi was also laughing so hard that her stomach hurt. She sat on the sofa and clutched her stomach.

Gu Zhou looked at the mother and daughter gently, his lips curving up slightly, as if they were the only two people in his world.

Lu Jiang, who had been sitting at the side, had long noticed the way Gu Zhou was looking at Qiao Nian. He was especially familiar with this gaze. At that time, his father had looked at his mother like this.

It seemed that Gu Zhou really liked Qiao Nian.

In that case, he was relieved.

“Xiao Shi is so smart. She’s indeed Mommy’s younger sister. The other one is Mommy’s fourth brother,” Qiao Nian introduced with a smile.

“Aunt.” Xiao Shi looked at Lu Qi and greeted obediently. Then, she looked at Lu Jiang. “Fourth Uncle.”

“Xiao Shi, come over quickly. Let Aunt hug you!” Lu Qi said eagerly. In order to hug Xiao Shi, she sat down beside Qiao Nian.
