Qiao Nian smiled coldly and said, “Alright, call someone from the operating theater over now. We’ll ask him in person.”

At that moment, Li Na walked in with the pills.

Li Na was sensitive to the strange atmosphere in the room. Her heart skipped a beat and she swallowed nervously. “Mr. Lu, your medicine!”

When Song Yue saw Li Na, her eyes lit up.

Li Na, the young nurse, looked like a yes-man. She probably wouldn’t lie.

Song Yue smiled sweetly and said to Li Na gently, “Miss Li Na.”

Li Na’s heart was in her throat when she heard Song Yue calling her. Then, she pretended to be calm and turned to look at Song Yue. She asked politely, “Miss Song, what can I do for you?”

Song Yue went straight to the point. “I have a very important question to ask you. You have to tell the truth. If you lie, don’t blame me for being rude. When Mr. Lu was undergoing surgery, did Qiao Nian donate blood to Mr. Lu?”

Li Na recalled Qiao Nian’s words and nodded. “Yes, Doctor Qiao donated blood to Mr. Lu!”

Lu Zhu was slightly stunned. He had not expected Li Na to say that, and the answer was what he expected.

Except there was something wrong with Li Na’s eyes. She was looking down to her right, and she was swallowing hard. She looked as if she were guilty of lying.

When Song Yue heard Li Na’s words, her lips curled up into a bright smile. She knew it. Qiao Nian was a liar. This time, Brother Lu Zhu would definitely believe her.

Song Yue smiled at Li Na and said, “You can leave now.”

Li Na silently set the pills on the nightstand. “Yes,” she said, and hurried outside.

Song Yue sat proudly in her wheelchair, looking down on Qiao Nian. She shouted, “Qiao Nian, there’s already a witness. What else do you have to say?”

“Actually, back in the emergency room—”

“I advise you not to quibble anymore. When I found out that you donated blood to Brother Lu Zhu, I thought it was a little strange. Why didn’t you tell Brother Lu Zhu with great fanfare? Now I understand that you deliberately hid this matter to pretend to be Brother Lu Zhu’s sister. You really have ulterior motives!”

Towards the end, Song Yue couldn’t help but get excited.

Song Yue took out her phone from her pocket. These were the bank records of Li Na and Doctor Sha. After the surgery, Qiao Nian had transferred two million yuan to them.

Song Yue pushed the wheelchair to Lu Zhu’s bed and handed the phone to him. With a gentle expression, she said, “Brother Lu Zhu, don’t be fooled by Qiao Nian’s flowery words.”

When Lu Zhu saw the payment information, his eyes gradually became deep and his expression complicated.

Lu Zhu’s frown deepened. His Sugar was already thinking very far ahead.

He knew exactly why Sugar had wired money to the doctors and nurses.

Qiao Nian clenched her fists so tightly that her knuckles turned white. She looked at Song Yue with a sinister expression, wishing she could punch her.

Qiao Nian turned around and glanced at Lu Zhu again. She saw that he had been staring at Song Yue’s phone thoughtfully. She couldn’t tell what he was thinking at all.

Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat.

Would her brother believe what she said?

Would he believe Song Yue’s words since her words sounded reasonable?

The situation was very disadvantageous to her now. Qiao Nian’s frown deepened.

A trace of anticipation flashed across her eyes as she looked at Lu Zhu. She really wanted to gain Lu Zhu’s trust.

Lu Zhu was her biological brother. They were real family members!
