Chapter 434: Zhou Zhou

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian carried her food upstairs. As soon as she opened the door, she looked around but did not see Gu Zhou.

Strange.

She closed the door and entered the room. Just as she placed the food on the small table, the sound of water flowing came from the bathroom.

It turned out that Gu Zhou was taking a shower. No wonder she hadn’t heard anything.

Qiao Nian wanted to have dinner with Gu Zhou after he came out. However, forty minutes had passed, but Gu Zhou still hadn’t come out.

Qiao Nian frowned slightly. Gu Zhou had taken a long shower this time.

Qiao Nian walked to the bathroom door and knocked.

Although there was the sound of water flowing inside, the person inside did not react at all.

Qiao Nian had a bad feeling. Her heart skipped a beat, and she knocked on the door a few times.

Still no movement from inside.

At the thought of Gu Zhou’s illness, Qiao Nian hurriedly pushed open the door.

There was a strong smell of blood in the room.

The bathroom was foggy, and Qiao Nian couldn’t see anyone clearly.

......

“Gu Zhou?”

Qiao Nian fumbled her way to the bathtub and saw Gu Zhou leaning against it, his face pale. The water in the bathtub was stained red with blood.

Jesus!

Is – is he dead?

At the thought of “death,” Qiao Nian’s heart tightened. She had a bad feeling.

No way.

No way.

Gu Zhou would definitely not die.

She put her hand under Gu Zhou’s nose and noticed that he was still breathing slightly. If she had come a little later, Gu Zhou might have…

She quickly helped Gu Zhou up and brought him to the bed. Then, she helped Gu Zhou take off his shirt. Her gaze inadvertently landed on the wound on his back.

Jesus!

How did this happen?

The left side of his back had been cut, and his flesh was exposed. She could clearly see the bones inside.

Qiao Nian took a closer look. Gu Zhou seemed to have been stitched up, but for some reason, it had opened again.

Qiao Nian’s eyes widened involuntarily!

Last night, Gu Zhou did not look too good. At that time, she thought that he was not feeling well, so she did not care.

It turned out that he had been injured last night, but he had been pretending to be fine.

Perhaps it was because she had hurt him last night, but he had dodged and accidentally opened the wound on his back, so the thread had broken free today.

How could he have been so stupid?

Why had he held on alone yesterday?

Why hadn’t he told her?

Qiao Nian didn’t dare to think too much about it. She turned around and took out a bottle of medicine from her suitcase, then sprinkled it directly on Gu Zhou’s wound.

Even though he was unconscious, he could still feel the pain and frowned.

After disinfecting the silver needles, Qiao Nian carefully stitched up Gu Zhou’s wound again, then wrapped it in gauze to prevent infection.

After dealing with all this, Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. She sat at the side to rest, her gaze on Gu Zhou’s face.

At this moment, Gu Zhou opened his eyes. Those beautiful eyes were extremely clear, no longer as deep as before. They seemed a little pitiful.

Something was wrong.

Gu Zhou usually did not have such an expression.

“Nian Nian, it hurts,” he said coquettishly.

He sounded extremely well-behaved.

Qiao Nian felt as if her heart had been stabbed by something. It turned out that Gu Zhou’s second personality had appeared.

“Nian Nian, don’t you like Zhou Zhou? Why are you ignoring me?” Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian aggrievedly, as if he would start crying if she didn’t speak.

“How could that be? Does it still hurt?” Qiao Nian picked up a towel and helped Gu Zhou dry his hair.

Gu Zhou pursed his lips. “Yes.”

“You’re injured now. You have to recuperate quietly for a few days. By then, it won’t hurt anymore,” Qiao Nian said gently.

Gu Zhou replied obediently, “Okay.”

Seeing Gu Zhou like this, Qiao Nian’s eyes flickered. “Why are you here?”

“I don’t know.”

Qiao Nian had heard from others in the past that some people’s other personalities and memories weren’t connected, so she could understand this answer.
