Chapter 236: Tickets Found

At Ye Ran’s command, the four of them moved to snatch the violin bag from Qiao Nian.

Actually, Qiao Nian could have beaten them to the ground, but she didn’t want to hurt her violin because of this. After some hesitation, she let go.

Ye Ran took Qiao Nian’s violin bag from her friend. She placed the violin bag on the table and opened it.

Inside the violin case was a very beautiful violin. The patterns on it were upright, dense, and uniform. It was simply the ferghana horse among horses.

Ye Ran’s heart skipped a beat. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Her family had also kept many musical instruments as treasures including violins but she had never seen such a heart stirring violin.

This violin must be expensive.

Ye Ran glanced at Qiao Nian suspiciously. How could Qiao Nian, who had no background, use such an expensive thing?

Ye Ran rolled her eyes and said coldly, “Student Qiao Nian, where did you steal this violin from?”

Qiao Nian looked at Ye Ran coldly. The names of Gu Zhou and Lu Zhu were written on her recommendation letter. She had only been able to study at this school because of the two of them. Her starting point was higher than anyone else present.

However, Qiao Nian was a low-profile person. She had never liked to cause trouble, but she wasn’t afraid of trouble either. Her patience was limited.

Ye Ran had already crossed the line. She clenched her fists tightly, the veins on the back of her hands bulging. Her cold gaze made one shiver. “I advise you to watch your mouth. Also, get your dirty hands off my violin!”

“Looks like I was right. You’re already flying into a rage out of humiliation.” Ye Ran pursed her lips and took out an item from the box, waving it in front of everyone. “Student Qiao Nian, can you explain to me what this is?”

Everyone’s gaze fell on the item in Ye Ran’s hand. It was none other than the ticket to Mr. Donghua’s concert.

Immediately, everyone in the classroom was stunned.

Ye Ran gripped the ticket in her hand tightly and glared at Qiao Nian, enunciating each word clearly. “You said that you didn’t steal my tickets. Now, tell me. What exactly is this?”

Wang Xuan frowned slightly. The tickets in Ye Ran’s hand were indeed tickets to Mr. Donghua’s concert.

The other students also looked at Qiao Nian in shock.

“Oh my god, no way. Qiao Nian really stole something!”

“Now that she’s been caught, she shouldn’t be able to deny it.”

“I don’t think Qiao Nian is that kind of person. She has such a good temperament, and she plays the zither so well.”

“Sigh, one really can’t judge a book by its cover. I was just speaking up for her!”

…

Hearing everyone’s discussion, Ye Ran smiled brightly.

“Qiao Nian, you’re really a fraud. How dare you try to act like a victim? Think about it carefully. You’ve stolen something and broken the school’s rules. You’ll be expelled from the school!” Ye Ran’s good friend, Gao Lin, said.

When Wang Xuan heard Gao Ling’s words, she frowned and said angrily, “Gao Lin, do you know how to speak properly? No matter what, you’re still a university student. Aren’t you being too rude by speaking like that?”

“Manners? Why would I be talking about manners with a thief?” Gao Lin raised her eyebrows, her voice rising in pitch. “Wang Xuan, why are you so concerned about Qiao Nian? Did the two of you work together to steal the tickets?”

Ye Ran nodded in agreement and said, “Gao Lin is right. If it weren’t for Gao Lin and the others’ help, I might have missed Mr. Dong Hua’s concert.”

When Gao Lin heard Ye Ran’s words, her lips curved up involuntarily.

This time, she had helped Ye Ran find the tickets to Mr. Dong Hua’s concert. If Ye Ran could get the tickets again, she would definitely bring her along.

When that happened, she would be able to meet Mr. Dong Hua with her own eyes!
