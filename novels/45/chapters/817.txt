That vicious woman who wanted to be her father’s wife.

And the woman he hated the most.

Why was Mommy so similar to Zhang Yi?

Gu Qi was a little protective. He liked Auntie Nian Nian very much, and Auntie Nian Nian was very gentle to him. He didn’t want anyone to slander Auntie Nian Nian.

Even if the person who slandered Auntie Nian Nian was his biological mother.

It was at this moment that Gu Qi had already forgotten that he was still acting as Xiao Shi. He looked at Song Man and said seriously, “You haven’t even seen Auntie Nian Nian. How do you know what she’s thinking? Moreover, she’s not even worried about your existence. Whether it will affect her status is her business. Why do you think that? It’s wrong for you to think that way!”

Gu Qi’s words were cold. For a moment, Song Man was speechless.

Song Man had never expected the child she had painstakingly raised to become an ingrate.

She had initially wanted to rely on Xiao Shi to deal with Qiao Nian, but it seemed that Xiao Shi was already on Qiao Nian’s side.

Why?

She had been with Xiao Shi for more than five years. Why was she still biased towards others?

The more Song Man thought about it, the angrier she became. She raised her hand and slapped Gu Qi’s face without hesitation.

Slap…

A clear voice resounded throughout the living room.

Gu Qi had never expected Song Man to hit him. He felt a burning pain.

He had never been beaten up since he was young.

No matter how bad Zhang Yi was, she would only hit his butt and palm.

This was the first time he had been hit like this.

He had actually been hit by his mother, whom he had missed for a long time.

Gu Qi’s face hurt, but his heart hurt even more.

He wasn’t heartbroken because he had been beaten up.

He was a little worried about his sister.

Did his sister often get beaten up when she was at home in the past?

Previously, he had specially asked Xiao Shi if Mommy would hit anyone when she was unstable.

At that time, Xiao Shi only smiled and did not speak.

Now that he thought about it, Xiao Shi had been beaten up a lot.

How had his sister suffered so much?

At this moment, the door was kicked open.

Gu Qi looked up and saw Qiao Nian standing at the door nervously.

When Gu Qi saw Qiao Nian, his eyes lit up. Qiao Nian was like a beam of light, illuminating the darkness in his heart.

Qiao Nian had just arrived. Just as she was about to enter, she saw Song Man hit Gu Qi.

She had initially thought that Gu Qi’s biological mother was quite good-looking, but Gu Qi’s mother didn’t look like she had worked at all.

Her gaze fell on Song Man’s hand. Her hand was smooth and delicate. It was obvious that she had been pampered.

Why were Xiao Shi’s hands so rough? It was obvious that she had done a lot of work.

As a mother who had been pampered, how could she let her child work?

Now, Song Man had hit Gu Qi without any explanation. What was going on? DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Qiao Nian walked up to Gu Qi, exuding a cold aura that came from hell. She shielded Gu Qi behind her, blocking Song Man’s view of Gu Qi.

Qiao Nian glared at Song Man, then turned to look at Gu Qi. Seeing the new palm print on Gu Qi’s face and how swollen it was, her heart ached.

Qiao Nian carefully touched Gu Qi’s face and said softly, “I need to ice it later.”

Gu Qi didn’t speak. Feeling the warmth of Qiao Nian’s palm, his eyes couldn’t help but turn red. He tried hard not to cry.

This was the first time he had seen his mommy. She had actually hit him.

Not only did his mommy not feel sorry for him, but she was also especially angry because he had told her what Auntie Nian Nian was like.

Song Man stood indifferently at the side. She glanced at Qiao Nian and Xiao Shi and instantly understood Qiao Nian’s relationship with Xiao Shi.

How was this fair?

She had been taking care of her for five years, but she had only seen Qiao Nian for two to three days. In the end, she still spoke up for Qiao Nian.

Even if Qiao Nian looked at her like a mother looking at her own child, Xiao Shi couldn’t betray her.

Not only did Song Man’s anger not subside, but it also grew worse.

At this moment, Song Man suddenly received a cold gaze.
