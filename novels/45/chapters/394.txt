Chapter 395: Regret

Jiang Yue looked at the butler with hatred. She felt that the entire world had let her down.

“Jiang Yue, you’re really too much. Old Madam has always doted on you and placed you in her heart. There was once when your school was holding a parent-teacher meeting. Initially, Old Madam had a cold and a fever, so I wanted to attend on her behalf. However, Old Madam insisted on attending your parent-teacher meeting no matter what!”

When Jiang Yue heard the butler say this, she lowered her head and did not say anything. It was because her grandmother often helped her attend parent-teacher conferences. Those people in school were all respectful to her, and everyone called her Eldest Miss Gu.

“Old Madam was grateful to Second Madam for saving her life, so she wanted to help her make a gown once. It’s just once. Are you so intolerant? Although the gown matter was very embarrassing, Old Madam still asked me to order some expensive fabric. She said that she wanted to help you make a gown in the future!”

Jiang Yue’s expression changed slightly. She did not expect her grandmother to have prepared so much for her behind her back. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

No!

This was impossible!

The butler must be lying to her!

Jiang Yue shook her head and cried, “Liar, you’re still lying to me!”

When Old Madam Gu heard Jiang Yue’s words, tears welled up in her eyes, and her heart ached.

The butler did not want to argue with Jiang Yue. He continued, “You said that I was lying to you. In the past, when you were in school, did Old Madam give you some rewards every time you did well in your exams? After so long, you’ve already treated this as a matter of course.”

Jiang Yue bit her lip lightly. When she was young, her grades were not good, so her grandmother had asked tutors to teach her. Every time she improved, her grandmother would give her other rewards.

The butler continued, “You keep talking about being an heir. Look at this and you’ll understand!”

......

After saying that, the butler threw a document in front of Jiang Yue.

Jiang Yue picked up the document from the ground and opened it. Her expression changed drastically. “How, how is this possible?”

Jiang Yue couldn’t believe her eyes.

How was that possible?

Grandma had actually put a third of her assets under her name, as well as the villa she was living in now.

It was also clearly written that she was the legitimate heir.

Not only that, but Grandma’s seal was also stamped on the bottom.

Could it be that Grandma had divided the assets into three?

One portion was given to Qiao Nian.

The last portion should have been left for Zhao Qian.

“Look, it’s only a third of the property. I reckon many people won’t be able to use it all in their lifetimes. The mountain behind the Gu family’s villa hasn’t been developed yet. If it’s all developed, it’ll probably be worth billions.”

Jiang Yue’s hands were trembling terribly, and her tears fell on the document one by one. Her voice was choked with sobs. “How is this possible? This is all fake. You’re lying to me!”

Actually, Qiao Nian could tell that her grandmother liked Jiang Yue a lot.

It was just that Jiang Yue wasn’t confident.

How could a smart person like her grandmother not know who had poisoned her? However, she had chosen to be tolerant.

Seeing Jiang Yue like this, Qiao Nian felt that it was ridiculous and pitiful. She said, “You should know Grandma’s notes and seal. Grandma has never thought of treating you unfairly. Besides, she did her best to take care of you. It’s just that you don’t trust her!”

Qiao Nian’s words were like a sharp blade that stabbed into Jiang Yue’s chest.

Jiang Yue’s mind went blank.

The butler looked at Jiang Yue and said unhappily, “I’ve always felt that the Gu family’s villa should be left to Second Young Master, but Grandma said that you’ve always felt insecure and wanted to leave it for you. She wanted you to stay here and feel the warmth of the family.”

When Jiang Yue heard Butler Zhao’s words, she cried like an abandoned child. She knew that she was wrong. At this moment, she really knew that she was wrong.
