Moreover, Madam President’s condition was unstable now. If she could stay in the palace, she would be able to rush over immediately when there was something wrong with Madam President.

However, she didn’t want to agree so readily.

Qiao Nian walked towards the bathroom. When she saw herself in the mirror, she instantly regretted it.

Gu Zhou was too crazy yesterday. There were many marks on her neck and collarbone.

Qiao Nian could only cover her face several times with the concealer. Even so, she could still see the marks on her collarbone.

She couldn’t help but despise the instigator.

Qiao Nian listened to the sound of running water and humming coming from the bathroom not far away. She could sense that Gu Zhou was in a very good mood today.

She couldn’t help but recall the crazy scene yesterday. Her face turned red uncontrollably, and her waist began to hurt again.

After Qiao Nian was done packing, she went out to change her clothes.

Qiao Nian walked towards the living room and saw Chen Qing entering.

When she saw Chen Qing, she quickly walked up to him and asked, “How are those herbs now? Did you take special care of the Orchid Crane Grass?”

The medicinal herbs that were airflown this time were all very precious and delicate. The environment in which those medicinal herbs grew was many times more demanding than the Falling Autumn Grass she had cultivated previously.

Falling Autumn Grass was like a rich young lady that was very pampered.

The Orchid Crane Grass was like the pea princess. Even though there were countless mattresses, one could still feel the peas at the bottom.

As long as the Orchid Crane Grass was a little uncomfortable, it would immediately wither.

Although her herbs were specially cultivated, she was still very worried about them.

Chen Qing said seriously, “The people over there send photos of the herbs every half an hour. Moreover, I have surveillance video of the herbs room. Everything is normal with the herbs now.”

Gu Zhou walked down the stairs and nodded at Chen Qing. His gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s neck and collarbone, and he saw that all the marks from last night had disappeared.

He liked the fact that she had his marks on her.

Chen Qing came in and was about to report what had happened yesterday when his gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face. He greeted, “Second Young Master.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Gu Zhou had just taken a shower and was still covered in steam. His hair was dripping with water, and he looked a little wild and sexy.

Gu Zhou put Qiao Nian’s jacket on her, lest she catch a cold. Only then did he stroke Qiao Nian’s hair.

Qiao Nian glanced at Gu Zhou and frowned slightly, as if saying, “You’re messing up my hair.”

However, in Gu Zhou’s opinion, Qiao Nian was acting like a spoiled child. With a smile in his eyes, he said, “I’ve already asked the servants to make your favorite food.”

“Yes,” Qiao Nian replied.

Gu Zhou pulled Qiao Nian towards the dining hall. Chen Qing lowered his head and followed. He immediately reported, “The palace was especially lively yesterday afternoon.”

Gu Zhou was sitting at the dining table. When he heard Chen Qing’s words, he raised his eyebrows slightly. “Continue.”

Chen Qing said with a serious expression, “Earl Mark made a scene at the entrance of the palace yesterday afternoon. Not only that, but Earl Mark also called all the ministers who supported him over to pressure the president.”

“It’s precisely because of this that the president held a meeting directly. The ministers who have always supported the president are also retaliating against Mark.” Chen Qing paused for a moment and continued, “Originally, there were endless internal conflicts in the royal family. Earl Mark often caused trouble for the president. Now that Princess Annie was suspected of murdering the President’s Madam, Earl Mark is at a disadvantage and is being attacked by the president’s ministers.”

No matter what, the last time Princess Annie sent Falling Autumn Grass to Madam President, Qiao Nian had discovered that there was poison in the Falling Autumn Grass. This meant that Princess Annie was the culprit.

But everyone understood that Princess Anne must have received an order from Earl Mark.

When Qiao Nian heard Chen Qing’s words, a trace of surprise flashed in her eyes. She asked, “Where’s Earl Harry?”

Earl Harry was the president’s younger brother.

“Earl Harry didn’t appear,” Chen Qing said with a serious expression. “Our people found out that Earl Harry injured his leg when he was preparing to go to the palace.”

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian looked at each other and saw the seriousness in each other’s eyes.

This time, Earl Harry had a timely fall, just in time to avoid the battle between the president and Earl Mark.
