Chapter 392: Confession

Jiang Yue’s breathing became more and more rapid, and she felt a little breathless. She looked up at Qiao Nian in fear.

Qiao Nian’s gaze landed on the ancestral hall. She asked, “How dare you tell your ancestors that you’ve never harmed Grandma? Aren’t you afraid that the Gu family’s ancestors will come looking for you in the middle of the night?”

Jiang Yue quickly covered her ears with her hands and shouted in horror, “Stop talking, I don’t want to hear it anymore!”

Qiao Nian stood rooted to the ground, her gaze on Jiang Yue’s face. Then, she said, “Since you’ve already broken the oath you’ve made and hurt Grandma, Grandma has decided to let you leave the Gu family!”

Jiang Yue shook her head frantically.

No.

She could not leave the Gu family.

After leaving the Gu family, she would lose all her current glory and wealth. If she was no longer the eldest daughter of the Gu family, no one would take care of her.

“No, Grandma… Grandma would never treat me like this. I want to see Grandma!” As Jiang Yue spoke, she stood up and walked towards the villa.

Grandma had always been soft-hearted. As long as she apologized to Grandma and knelt down to beg for her forgiveness, she believed that Grandma would definitely forgive her.

Seeing Jiang Yue like this, the butler walked forward and blocked her way.

“It’s really too late now, Miss Jiang Yue. You should leave! What Second Young Master asked you just now was also what Old Madam wanted to ask you. As long as you were willing to repent in the ancestral hall, Old Madam Gu was willing to consider your past relationship and give you a chance to turn over a new leaf. However, you’ve already missed this opportunity!”

When Jiang Yue heard the butler say this, she said in a daze, “How is that possible? How can Grandma be so heartless?”

......

Gu Zhou held Qiao Nian’s hand and walked out. When he passed by Jiang Yue, a cold glint flashed across his eyes. “All your things were given to you by Grandma. You don’t have to pack anymore. You can get lost now!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“No, no!” The tears on Jiang Yue’s face instantly fell. She cried and knelt in front of Gu Zhou, begging, “Brother Ah Zhou, I beg you, please give me another chance. This is my home. If I leave here, I don’t know where else I can go!”

As Jiang Yue spoke, she reached out to grab Gu Zhou’s hand.

Gu Zhou avoided Jiang Yue coldly and said, “I remember telling you before that as long as you take good care of Grandma, you’ll still be the eldest daughter of the Gu family. However, all of this has been ruined by you!”

Jiang Yue cried even harder. She shook her head vigorously and said in despair, “Brother Ah Zhou, I was wrong last time. I accidentally heard Grandma and Zhao Qian say that they wanted to leave the assets to Second Sister-in-law. I only did that because I was stupid!”

As Jiang Yue spoke, she cried even harder. “I’ve been feeling very sorry for Grandma recently, so I’ve been taking good care of her and staying by her side. I beg you, I promise that I won’t make any more mistakes in the future. I’ll behave myself in the future…”

At this moment, the butler was stunned.

The coldness on Gu Zhou’s body intensified.

Seeing Jiang Yue like this, the corners of Qiao Nian’s lips curled up slightly, and a sly look flashed across her beautiful fox eyes.

Heh.

Jiang Yue finally admitted it.

She had been waiting for this moment. She couldn’t help but want to applaud Jiang Yue.

Jiang Yue, who was originally in despair, was stunned when she heard the strong applause. At this moment, a trace of confusion flashed across her eyes.

The butler scolded angrily, “Miss Jiang, how could you do such a thing? Old Madam treats you like her own granddaughter. How could she do such a heartless thing?”

When Jiang Yue heard the butler say this, she was stunned.

Well…

Jiang Yue quickly regained her senses. She looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief and questioned, “You were actually plotting against me?”

Qiao Nian instantly smiled brightly and asked, “If you have a clear conscience, I won’t be able to plot against you.”
