Chapter 525: Nian’er

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian hurriedly opened her eyes and took a deep breath. Only then did the uneasiness and suffocation gradually disappear.

She had a vague feeling that Gu Zhou’s third personality knew her, which meant that they had met before.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian recalled that he had called her Nian’er. When he spoke, he was careful, as if they had known each other for many years. Then, today was their long-awaited reunion.

However, after thinking about it carefully, she really could not remember where she had seen Gu Zhou before.

In her memory, only Qiao Yu would call her Nian’er.

If Gu Zhou called her Nian’er, that scene… Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Qiao Nian didn’t dare imagine it.

Her mind was all over the place now, as if it had all been a dream.

However, Gu Zhou did have a third personality.

Just as Qiao Nian’s mind was in a mess and she was in a daze, the bathroom door opened.

Zhou Zhou must have come out of the shower.

Qiao Nian looked over.

Zhou Zhou had already dried his hair cleverly. The dim yellow light fell on his fine hair. He looked gentle and warm.

Even her chiseled face had turned gentle.

His face was well-defined, and his facial features were well-defined. His eyes were deep-set, but his pupils were crystal clear, like a pool of clear water. They were extremely clean.

Perhaps because of his illness, his skin was ridiculously pale.

After taking a shower, the hot air caused a blush to appear on his sickly pale face. It was pure and lustful.

For the first time, Qiao Nian realized that as long as a man was good-looking, he could reveal his pure side.

Those clear eyes were fixed on her as if she were his whole world.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but feel nervous. Her hands tightened around the bed sheets beneath her.

Although she knew very well that Gu Zhou’s second personality was soft and innocent, without a trace of lethality, she still felt the danger he brought when she saw him wearing a bathrobe. The collar was loose and slightly open, revealing his strong and muscular figure.

While Qiao Nian was thinking, the man had already walked to the bed and approached her.

The refreshing scent of shower gel still lingered on his body. Qiao Nian couldn’t help but swallow.

Seeing Gu Zhou like this made her nervous.

Did she really have to sleep with him?

Although she had always been thick-skinned, she couldn’t take it anymore.

“Nian Nian, let’s sleep together!”

Hearing Gu Zhou’s words, Qiao Nian hardened her heart and slept on the bed.

She could feel the bed beside her sink. When she opened her eyes, she found Gu Zhou lying on his side, his face facing her.

His handsome face was almost flawless.

Qiao Nian felt as if she had just witnessed a feast.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips slightly.

“Nian Nian, why are you looking at me like that!”

Qiao Nian felt a headache coming on.

Could he stop calling her Nian Nian? She suddenly felt that Nian’er sounded better!

No, no.

Whether he called her Nian Nian or Nian’er, both men were very dangerous and troublesome.

Gu Zhou was still the best. Although he looked cold, he would always call her Qiao Nian.

“Nian Nian.”

Qiao Nian gathered her thoughts and tried her best to suppress the anger in her heart. She smiled lightly and said, “Alright, I won’t look at you anymore. Go to sleep!”

“Nian Nian, Zhou Zhou needs Nian Nian to hug him to sleep!” Gu Zhou stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian felt a little uncomfortable under his gaze. She hurriedly said, “Hurry up and turn around.”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Gu Zhou obediently turned around, his back facing her.
