Chapter 297: Threat

Qiao Nian stood rooted to the ground. Seeing Gu Zhou and Jiang Yue leave one after another, a trace of confusion flashed in her eyes.

Gu Zhou seemed to be angry again just now.

Could Jiang Yue have said something wrong?

Before Qiao Nian could figure it out, the two of them had already disappeared around the corner.

Jiang Yue’s heart was beating faster and faster, almost jumping out of her mouth.

She followed behind Gu Zhou and carefully walked into the study. Swallowing nervously, she explained with a pale expression, “Brother Ah Zhou, I was just asking casually. I really didn’t mean anything else.”

Gu Zhou locked the study door indifferently.

Jiang Yue was so frightened that she almost suffocated. She took a step back and looked at Gu Zhou in fear. Seeing Gu Zhou exuding a cold aura, she shivered in fear.

Jiang Yue lowered her gaze and swallowed. She was really frightened to death by Gu Zhou.

Clenching her fists, she looked up at Gu Zhou and explained seriously, “Brother Ah Zhou, I was really just asking casually. Recently, Grandma has been mumbling that she wants to have a grandchild, so I asked…”

“How did you know?” Gu Zhou interrupted Jiang Yue mercilessly. His expression was dark, and his voice was as cold as ice.

Jiang Yue couldn’t help but tremble. Although Gu Zhou’s back was facing her, she felt that Gu Zhou’s gaze could definitely kill her.

Jiang Yue heaved a sigh of relief. Only by remaining calm would she not give herself away. She pretended not to know anything. “Brother Ah Zhou, what are you talking about? I don’t know anything. Am I supposed to know anything?”

“Jiang Yue.” Gu Zhou’s indifferent voice interrupted Jiang Yue.

He turned around and placed his hands in his pockets. Looking down at Jiang Yue, his gaze fell on her eyes.

Jiang Yun’s heart skipped a beat. For some reason, she felt that Gu Zhou was looking at her as if she was a dead person.

Dead person…

Jiang Yue couldn’t help but shiver. Gu Zhou had never called her by her name in the past, and his gaze and voice were a little scary now.

Jiang Yue’s face grew paler and paler. Cold sweat broke out on her back. She seemed to smell death.

“Brother… Brother Ah Zhou…”

“When did you know?” Gu Zhou’s voice was sinister and terrifying, like a demon that had crawled out of hell.

“Brother Ah Zhou, what are you talking about? I don’t know. I don’t know anything!” Jiang Yue’s eyes were red, and her lips were trembling.

“Lan!”

Gu Zhou had just finished speaking.

A snake slithered down from a pillar and coiled itself around Gu Zhou’s wrist.

Jiang Yue screamed in fear. Her legs went weak and she staggered back. “Brother Ah Zhou, what exactly do you mean by this?”

“Tomorrow, the headline on Weibo will be Matriarch Gu’s god granddaughter, Jiang Yue, snuck into the study of the Second Young Master of the Gu family. She wanted to steal some documents, but was discovered by his beloved snake. In the end, she was poisoned to death.” Gu Zhou’s expression was calm. His phoenix-like eyes narrowed slightly as he enunciated each word clearly. “What do you think of this method of death?”

The snake seemed to understand Gu Zhou’s words. It spat out its tongue and glared fiercely at Jiang Yue. If Gu Zhou gave the order, it would bite Jiang Yue to death without hesitation.

Jiang Yue trembled in fear and took a few steps back. She looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief and asked in fear, “Brother Ah Zhou, what do you mean by this?”

“Have you thought about how to answer my question just now?” Gu Zhou asked without hesitation, not wanting to waste his breath on Jiang Yue.

Jiang Yue knew very well that if she told the truth, she would probably die without a burial ground. The only thing she could do now was continue lying.

“Brother Ah Zhou, I was really just asking casually…”

“Lan!”

As soon as Gu Zhou finished speaking, the snake charged towards Jiang Yue without hesitation.
