“Don’t touch me. Go away!”

Qiao Nian screamed hysterically. She wanted to retract her hand, but she couldn’t. She was trembling, completely immersed in that night five years ago.

She hated it when others got close to her, especially men.

Qiao Nian’s body trembled even more. All she wanted to do was escape from this room. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

… .

Sensing that something was wrong with Qiao Nian, Gu Zhou tightened his grip on her hand, not daring to let go at all.

Previously, he had thought that Qiao Nian was just afraid of the dark. Why was her reaction so drastic? It was a little like a victim’s syndrome.

Could something have happened to her in the darkness?

This was unlikely.

Previously, he had gotten someone to investigate Qiao Nian. Her identity was very clean, and there was nothing wrong with her.

Could it be that she had changed her personal information?

That made sense. Qiao Nian was able to order around Qin Chuan’s people. How could she change such a small matter so easily?

Gu Zhou’s brow furrowed deeper and deeper. If it weren’t for the fact that the two of them had experienced so much together, he would definitely think that Qiao Nian had ulterior motives.

But now, he knew that Qiao Nian was a pawn used by the Qiao family. She had no choice but to marry him.

“Qiao Nian…” Gu Zhou called out softly.

Qiao Nian’s body trembled even more violently, and her coat fell to the ground. She seemed to be immersed in pain, as if she was still enduring torture.

“No, please, don’t come over…”

Please…

When Gu Zhou heard this word, his heart skipped a beat.

When they were in MY, Qiao Nian had brought Lu Zhu out of Jiang Chi’s villa alone in high spirits.

She was as gentle as water when she was with Gu Qi.

When she faced him, her fox-like eyes would always flash with cunning.

At this moment, this was the first time he had heard Qiao Nian say the word “please” helplessly and hopelessly.

Fear, despair, helplessness, pity…

These negative emotions gripped Qiao Nian tightly, as if they wanted to drag her into the abyss.

Five years ago, that girl was just like Qiao Nian now and was about to fall into hell. He clearly remembered that girl begging him with this voice.

However, their voices were different.

Gu Zhou let go. Hearing the commotion, he knew that Qiao Nian had already curled up into a ball by the wall.

“Wait for me.” With that, Gu Zhou turned and walked towards the other end of the corridor. He had designed this villa himself, so he knew where the main power switch was.

Walking to the electrical room, Gu Zhou opened the door and groped around in the darkness. Then, he pushed the main power switch up.

The originally dark villa was instantly brightly lit.

At first, Gu Zhou was not used to the brightness of the lights. He blinked and gradually got used to it.

He hurriedly walked towards Qiao Nian.

At this moment, the corridor was empty. Only a coat was left on the ground.

Suddenly, the scene from that night five years ago flashed in Gu Zhou’s mind.

The bed was in a mess, and there was a woman’s coat on the ground.

Gu Zhou felt an emptiness in his heart. He glanced around but didn’t see Qiao Nian.

Strange. Where had she gone?

He didn’t hear any footsteps. There were no rooms or doors around the long corridor, which meant that Qiao Nian must have headed towards the small garden at the back of the villa.

Gu Zhou quickly walked towards the garden. He looked around but didn’t see Qiao Nian.

Gu Zhou was about to leave when he saw Qiao Nian curled up under a tree next to the swing. She was holding her head in her hands, as if she had been abandoned by the entire world.

Gu Zhou’s heart ached. Looking at Qiao Nian, he didn’t know how to pull her out of her pain.

He squatted down and stayed by Qiao Nian’s side, silently accompanying her. He understood that Qiao Nian was probably the same as him. She was mentally ill. When she was sick, she didn’t want to communicate with anyone.
