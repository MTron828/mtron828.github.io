1049 Going Back on Your Words?

“Go back on my word?” Lu Jiang smiled. He seemed to have thought of something and asked, “What medicine did you just say?”

“The medicine Qiao Xin gave me.” He Cheng frowned and asked, “What do you mean by these words now?”

He Cheng had a bad feeling about this. He asked shakily, “You were the one who asked me to treat her well.”

“I’ve already told you before that I’ll give you two choices. Either turn yourself in or entertain her well. How could you do such a despicable thing to her and even upload a video live-stream of the gang rape online?”

!!

He Cheng was so angry that he almost spat out a mouthful of blood. He frowned and said, “You’re twisting logic. You clearly…”

“I just asked you to entertain her. I didn’t say anything else!” Lu Jiang refused to admit it and said coldly, “Not only did you do such a despicable thing, but you also gave her medicine. Could it be that she’s also taking drugs?”

If news of Qiao Xin taking drugs got out, the Qiao family’s share price would plummet again.

“No, that medicine will make a woman lewd. As long as she takes it, a chaste woman will become a lewd woman.” He Cheng’s expression darkened as he pursed his lips tightly. “So you were lying to me previously, right?”

He Cheng did not expect to be tricked by Fourth Master again. He was furious.

“I made it very clear what she was planning to do. Return it exactly as it was.” Lu Jiang paused and raised his eyebrows slightly. “Isn’t that so?”

“Of course.” He Cheng nodded.

He did everything Lu Jiang said and even completed the mission.

“I originally thought that Qiao Xin just wanted to find someone to beat up my sister. Now, it seems that I’ve misunderstood.” Lu Jiang’s face darkened as he looked at He Cheng darkly. “You actually colluded with Qiao Xin to drug my sister and even wanted to find so many people to attack her. You’re really bold!”

When He Cheng heard Lu Jiang’s words, his face instantly turned pale.

Previously, he had only wanted to complete Lu Jiang’s mission, but he did not expect to admit it now.

Lu Jiang’s bodyguard, Allen, took a step forward and said coldly, “Our master originally wanted to discuss a business deal with the two of you, but I didn’t expect the two of you to be in cahoots. You even wanted to do dirty things to the eldest daughter of the Lu family. Now, not only did you bully Qiao Xin, but you also found someone to gang-rape her. Looks like you can only stay in prison for the rest of your life!”

He Cheng was stunned. His eyes widened. “W-What do you mean by that?”

“We’ve recorded everything you said just now, and we’ve already called the police!” Allen said expressionlessly. He took out the recording pen from his pocket and waved it in front of He Cheng.

He Cheng’s legs gave way and he almost knelt on the ground. He hurriedly supported himself against the wall and barely managed to stabilize himself.

He had been deceived!

The Lu family had never thought of letting him go. They only wanted to get evidence of his crimes and send him to prison. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

What a drastic move!

This time, he was doomed!

He Cheng questioned angrily, “This is a trap. This is a trap by the Lu family. You’re the Fourth Master of the Lu family after all. How can you do such a dirty thing! Aren’t you afraid of being mocked?”

Lu Jiang looked at He Cheng indifferently. He didn’t say anything and walked to the side. Before leaving, he gave Allen a look.

Allen nodded slightly, indicating that he understood.

“Fourth Brother Lu, stop right there. Make yourself clear!” He Cheng shouted in exasperation. He stepped forward and prepared to grab Lu Jiang.

However, before He Cheng could take a step, he was stopped by Allen!

Allen kicked He Cheng’s balls!

At this moment, how could she not feel despair?

He covered his lower body with both hands tightly. It felt a little wet. When he looked down, he saw that his hands were covered in blood.

This was to make him have no descendants!

It made his mind go blank!

If the thing below him was gone, wouldn’t he become a eunuch?

Fourth Brother Lu was really heartless. He actually wanted him to be a eunuch for the rest of his life and never be able to play with women again.
