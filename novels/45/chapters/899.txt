900 The Person She Hated the Most

She and Gu Zhou had been engaged since they were young.

However, she had been kidnapped. Later on, by some freak combination of circumstances, she married Gu Zhou again on behalf of Qiao Xin.

Previously, she had marveled at the wonders of fate. It had actually brought her and Gu Zhou together again.

However, when she found out that Gu Zhou was the man from that night, she no longer knew how to face him.

If it weren’t for Gu Zhou, she wouldn’t have lost her innocence.

If it weren’t for Gu Zhou, her memory wouldn’t have been in a mess during childbirth.

If it weren’t for Gu Zhou, she wouldn’t have been filled with hatred for what happened to her children.

…

However, she cared a lot about Gu Zhou.

She really didn’t know how to face Gu Zhou anymore.

Qiao Nian looked at the traffic outside in confusion and laughed at herself. She was simply the biggest fool in the world.

The funniest thing was that a group of people had witnessed her ridiculous side with their own eyes.

“Sugar.”

A gentle voice rang out in Qiao Nian’s ear.

Qiao Nian looked up and saw Lu Zhu sitting opposite her.

Lu Zhu’s originally meticulous hair was a little messy. Clearly, he had walked very quickly just now, as if to see her as soon as possible.

Qiao Nian’s uneasy heart gradually calmed down.

“Brother.” Qiao Nian forced a smile.

Seeing the smile on Qiao Nian’s face, Lu Zhu’s expression faltered slightly. Qiao Nian was smiling on the surface, but he could tell that she was very disappointed and she was very sad.

“Did something happen?” Lu Zhu looked at Qiao Nian worriedly. Then, he recalled that Qiao Nian had been staying in the Gu family all this time. He thought that Gu Zhou must have bullied Sugar. “Sugar, if Gu Zhou bullies you, just say so. Brother will help you bully him back!”

Qiao Nian’s heart warmed. She shook her head and said, “Brother, he didn’t bully me. Moreover, he treats me very well.”

Lu Zhu couldn’t understand why Qiao Nian still looked unhappy even though Gu Zhou treated her very well. “It’s good that he didn’t bully you. Why aren’t you happy?”

Qiao Nian looked up and met Lu Zhu’s worried eyes, not knowing what to say.

At this moment, the waiter walked over and put down the two drinks Qiao Nian had ordered before leaving.

After the waiter left, Lu Zhu looked at Qiao Nian gently and said softly, “Sugar, I’m your brother. No matter what happens, I’ll stand on your side. If you have anything to say, just tell me.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Zhu’s words, her eyes flickered. In a panic, she picked up the cup and took a sip. Only then did she place the cup on the table and pursed her lips.

Lu Zhu was not in a hurry. He waited quietly for Qiao Nian to think it through.

Qiao Nian gripped the cup in her hand tightly and said carefully, “Brother, do you still remember when I first married Gu Zhou, Qiao Xin came to look for you with a pendant?”

Lu Zhu frowned. He didn’t seem to remember such a thing.

Qiao Nian reminded him, “At that time, you said that your pendant had been stolen!”

The pendant had been stolen?

The fragments in Lu Zhu’s mind were pieced together. He remembered.

Why would Sugar ask that?

Lu Zhu’s heart instantly sank to the bottom. He felt very uneasy. “Why are you asking this?”

Qiao Nian looked up at Lu Zhu and said seriously, “Brother, this matter is very important to me. Can you tell me now if that pendant belongs to you?”

Lu Zhu did not speak. He picked up the cup and took a sip.

In his impression, Qiao Nian had always been a calm person. Qiao Nian had even calmly saved him from Jiang Chi in MY.

He remembered that Qiao Nian was only excited and anxious when she acknowledged him as her family member.

Lu Zhu still remembered that Qiao Xin had helped someone else safeguard that pendant back then.

Could it be that Qiao Xin had gotten that pendant from Sugar…

Otherwise, why would Sugar be so agitated?

Qiao Nian had been waiting anxiously for Lu Zhu’s answer. Seeing that Lu Zhu was silent, she called out, “Brother?”

Lu Zhu said solemnly, “That pendant isn’t mine.”

Qiao Nian’s face turned pale, and her breathing deepened.

Back then, it was precisely because she thought that the pendant belonged to her brother that she had never suspected him.

She had never expected her brother to lie.
