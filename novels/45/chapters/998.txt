999 Younger Brother and Sister

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She looked at Xiao Shi in surprise and frowned slightly. “Don’t you already have a brother?”

“But it’ll only be lively if there are more children!” Xiao Shi said seriously. She counted on her fingers and finally put down her hand helplessly. “If possible, Mommy can give birth to a brother or sister for me!”

Qiao Nian felt terrible. She glared at Gu Zhou.

Last night, Gu Zhou had told her that. He had even said that it would be more lively if there were children at home. He hoped that she could give birth to more children.

!!

Gu Zhou must have instilled these thoughts in Xiao Shi! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Lu Qi, who was standing at the side, looked at Gu Zhou’s face.

She knew that Xiao Shi was very smart, but she felt that it was impossible for her to say that she wanted a younger brother or sister.

Brother Ah Zhou must have taught her that.

She looked at Gu Zhou and saw him looking at his sister affectionately. This was the first time she had seen Brother Ah Zhou’s gentle gaze.

Lu Qi now felt that she shouldn’t be here, because she no longer wanted to eat dog food.

Lu Jiang, who was standing at the side, frowned.

Giving birth?

Give birth to what?

It was very harmful for a woman to give birth.

Lu Jiang wanted to refuse on Qiao Nian’s behalf, but looking into Xiao Shi’s pitiful eyes, he sighed silently. He would secretly tell Qiao Nian not to have children in the future!

He didn’t want to leave a bad impression on his niece.

He had to show Xiao Shi the video of a woman giving birth.

By then, Xiao Shi would probably no longer make a fuss about Qiao Nian giving birth.

Qiao Nian looked at Xiao Shi’s expectant gaze. She wanted to refuse, but she couldn’t bring herself to do so.

She glared at Gu Zhou, but saw the gentleness in his eyes.

This man only knew how to pretend to be gentle.

“Mommy, can you give me a younger brother or sister?” Xiao Shi looked at Qiao Nian pitifully, tears almost falling from her eyes.

Qiao Nian couldn’t take it anymore. She felt that no one could resist Xiao Shi’s coquettishness, so she smiled and said, “Okay!”

When Xiao Shi received Qiao Nian’s affirmative answer, she jumped up in joy and applauded happily. “Alright, I’ll have younger siblings in the future. Daddy, Mommy will definitely not leave us!”

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian meaningfully and walked over to sit down beside Xiao Shi. He picked her up and said softly, “Giving birth is a very painful thing. Your mommy isn’t in good health either, so let’s not have younger siblings, okay?”

Qiao Nian was a little moved.

Lu Qi couldn’t help but smile. She really didn’t want to eat dog food anymore, but she was still eating it happily.

Lu Jiang heaved a sigh of relief. Fortunately, Gu Zhou was just joking. He did not want his sister to have another child.

Xiao Shi thought about it seriously and frowned. Her face was tense as she said solemnly, “Since giving birth to a younger brother or sister will make Mommy uncomfortable, I don’t want a younger brother or sister. I just want Mommy. I hope Mommy can accompany us and everyone can live healthily.”

The fact that giving birth was very harmful to her body made Xiao Shi involuntarily think of Song Man. Song Man had lost an arm, and she was very gloomy. She could not control her temper.

Xiao Shi did not want her mommy to become like Song Man. She hoped that her mommy could smile at her gently every day and tell her bedtime stories considerately.

When Gu Zhou heard Xiao Shi’s words, he gently rubbed her head, his lips curving up slightly.

Xiao Shi still loved them very much.

Their children were really obedient and adorable.

Lu Qi still wanted to hug Xiao Shi, but she couldn’t bear to disturb the family of three sitting together.

“Uncle, when are you going to give birth to a baby?” Xiao Shi said innocently. “If you give birth to a baby, then the baby will be my brother or sister!”

Lu Jiang was instantly speechless.

Wasn’t this a blatant double standard?

Xiao Shi couldn’t bear to let Qiao Nian have a child, but she could bear to let his wife have a child.

However, Lu Jiang still smiled and said, “We’ll have a child soon!”
