Speaking of which, it was strange. When did Gu Zhou get married?

Cui Huai also asked his spies to keep an eye on Gu Zhou. Gu Zhou stayed at home all day, and sometimes went to the company. He had never noticed anything abnormal about Gu Zhou, let alone which woman Gu Zhou was close to.

In the past year, Gu Zhou had been close to that woman called Qiao Nian. Even if the two of them were together, it didn’t mean that they could immediately give birth to such a big child.

According to the informant, the child looked to be five or six years old.

Cui Huai had just thought for a long time and came to a conclusion. Gu Zhou had secretly gotten a doctor to extract his sperm and found a surrogate to give birth.

!!

If Gu Zhou did this, this matter would indeed not be easy to discover. After all, no woman’s face would have the words “I’m pregnant with Gu Zhou’s child” written on it.

Moreover, Gu Zhou must have done it especially secretly. That woman probably didn’t even know who the child belonged to.

Cui Huai frowned and ordered coldly, “I don’t care what method you use. You have to keep them in MY. Bring me their family of three!”

Cui Huai paused and thought of the child in the photo. “By the way, don’t hurt the child. I have other uses for that child!”

“Yes!” Mr. Chen nodded.

Cui Huai waved at Mr. Chen, signaling for him to leave.

Mr. Chen nodded and left Cui Huai’s office with Chang Feng.

The two of them did not speak along the way. Mr. Chen walked in front, and Chang Feng walked behind him.

When they arrived at the company door, Chang Feng walked forward first and opened the door of the back seat. After Mr. Chen got in, he walked around to the back seat door on the other side, opened it, and sat down.

The chauffeur drove towards Mr. Chen’s villa.

Mr. Chen and Chang Feng looked at each other, their attention all on the person in the driver’s seat.

The chauffeur had already been changed. It seemed that they could no longer speak at ease in the car.

After the car left the entrance of HH Corporation, Chang Feng turned to look at Mr. Chen and said softly, “This mission won’t be easy.”

Mr. Chen sat there, looking out of the window casually. He pursed his lips slightly and said, “Yes, let’s cause some trouble for them. We can’t let them leave. As for bringing them over, we have to think of a foolproof plan. We can’t alert the enemy!”

“Yes,” Chang Feng agreed.

Cui Huai sat in the office and heard everything Mr. Chen and Chang Feng had said in the car. A trace of ruthlessness flashed in his eyes.

Chen Quan was still as wishy-washy as ever.

The amusement park was brightly lit, and the amusement park rides gradually stopped. Even the number of tourists decreased greatly.

Xiao Bao sat on a small bench in front of the roller coaster, carrying a small school bag. He looked at his shoes in confusion.

This was his favorite pair of shoes. He had specially bought them to see his mommy. He wanted to play with his mommy and sleep with his daddy at night.

Strange.

Why wasn’t Uncle Feng here yet?

Uncle Feng had said that he would pick him up!

Xiao Bao couldn’t help but grip his pants tightly, his eyes gradually turning red.

Uncle Feng, come and pick me up!

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian stood at the side.

Seeing that the number of people in the amusement park was decreasing, Qiao Nian frowned slightly. Xiao Bao had said that Eldest Senior Brother would definitely pick him up, but Eldest Senior Brother didn’t seem to have any intention of coming.

Gu Zhou looked at the disappointed Xiao Bao and whispered into Qiao Nian’s ear, “I think they’re handing Xiao Bao over to us now because they want us to bring him back to the country.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Qiao Nian also understood Gu Zhou’s words. She looked at Xiao Bao, who was sitting on the bench, with heartache.

Xiao Bao thought that Eldest Senior Brother would pick him up. He had been sitting on the bench and waiting since 4pm in the evening. Now, five hours had passed.

She looked at Xiao Bao waiting pitifully for Eldest Senior Brother. In her heart, she hoped that Eldest Senior Brother could bring Xiao Bao back.

But in the current situation, it seemed that Xiao Bao could not go back.

Qiao Nian sighed heavily and sat down beside Xiao Bao. She asked carefully, “Xiao Bao, Uncle Feng might be busy with other things. Why don’t you go home with Mommy today? We’ll wait for your Uncle Feng tomorrow, okay?”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Xiao Bao shook his head stubbornly.
