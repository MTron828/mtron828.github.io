Qiao Nian smiled and pursed her lips. “Brother, what’s my name in the Lu family?”

She sensed that her brother didn’t seem to want to discuss this matter, so she asked another question.

What she really wanted to know was why Gu Chuan kept calling her Nian’er. Did he know that she was Qiao Nian, or did he know that she was the eldest daughter of the Lu family?

Qiao Nian pursed her lips, looking forward to Lu Zhu’s answer.

“You’re the eldest daughter of the Lu family, Lu Nian,” Lu Zhu said softly.

Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat, and her eyes widened uncontrollably.

When she was in the Lu family, they also had the same name.

Nian’er?

Could it be that Gu Zhou’s third personality was really related to the eldest daughter of the Lu family? Therefore, Gu Chuan was concerned about the eldest daughter of the Lu family, Lu Nian.

Was it because of the death of the eldest daughter of the Lu family that Gu Zhou had split into Gu Chuan?

At this moment, Lu Zhu, who was sitting in the office, was also frowning. Confusion appeared in his clear eyes.

If Qiao Nian hadn’t asked, he wouldn’t have remembered.

In the past, when Sugar was young, everyone would call her by her nickname. After she left, everyone could only remember her nickname.

The eldest daughter of the Lu family, Lu Nian.

Her name was Qiao Nian now.

There was a common word in both names. Nian.

“Sugar, who gave you your current name?”

Qiao Nian thought for a moment and shook her head. “I don’t know, but for as long as I can remember, my name has been this.”

“Both of these names have the word ‘Nian’ in them. Isn’t this too much of a coincidence? Do you think the person behind the scenes gave you this name? Will they know that you’re still alive?” Lu Zhu’s frown deepened, and his expression became more and more serious. His entire body emitted a cold aura.

If he knew who had taken Sugar away, he would definitely make him beg for death. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Qiao Nian shook her head gently and said, “I can’t remember what happened in the past anymore. I’ll find a time to visit the Qiao family later and see if I can get some information out of them.”

“Sugar, you have to be careful. Perhaps those people know that you’re still alive. No, it’s still too dangerous for you to go alone. I’ll get a few bodyguards to send you there.” Lu Zhu’s frown deepened. If the person behind the scenes still knew that Sugar was alive, shouldn’t he bring her home earlier?

“Brother, don’t send bodyguards over. I’ll be fine alone. Moreover, they might not even notice that I’m still alive. If you send bodyguards over, they’ll be able to find out about our relationship. Then, this will be troublesome.” Qiao Nian had no choice but to reject Lu Zhu’s good intentions.

When Lu Zhu heard Qiao Nian’s words, he heaved a sigh of relief and didn’t say anything else.

He really hoped that no one knew that Sugar was still alive. That way, she wouldn’t be in any danger.

On the other hand, Qiao Nian was also feeling very melancholic.

It seemed that Gu Zhou’s Gu Chuan personality was really related to her.

Gu Chuan’s low and paranoid voice seemed to ring in her ears again. His gaze was so determined, as if he was going to tie her to his side in the next moment.

Gu Chuan’s stubborn look made Qiao Nian realize that he couldn’t live without Nian’er.

If that was the case, she could use her identity as the eldest daughter of the Lu family, Lu Nian, to slowly treat Gu Chuan’s personality, causing his uneasiness and paranoia to gradually disappear.

However, there was something Qiao Nian couldn’t understand.

Gu Chuan had reminded her before.

“Your life was given to you by me!”

What exactly did that mean?

Could it be that Gu Chuan was also present when the eldest daughter of the Lu family was kidnapped?

Qiao Nian’s heart beat faster and faster, and the doubts in her mind increased. She had many things to confirm bit by bit.

However, she needed to quickly embroider the blessing bag. Otherwise, there wouldn’t be enough time.

Qiao Nian spoke a few more words to Lu Zhu before hanging up.

In the evening, Qiao Nian packed up her half-embroidered blessing bag and walked out.

She was about to tell Gu Qi a story when she saw Chen Qing walking in with a box.
