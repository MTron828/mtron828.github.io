1006 Moving Out

Gu Zhou’s voice was very pleasant to the ear. Perhaps it was because he had just woken up, but his voice was still a little sexy. There was a hint of doting in it, and it was very seductive.

Qiao Nian’s lips curved up slightly. She leaned her head gently into Gu Zhou’s arms and replied, “Yes!”

“There’s something I want to tell you.”

“Huh?” Qiao Nian poked her head out of Gu Zhou’s arms and looked at him in confusion.

“I want to move to the Dongjiang villa after you acknowledge your ancestors. What do you think?”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned, not understanding. “Why?”

“I don’t want to live here.”

“Isn’t this place good?” Qiao Nian blinked in confusion.

Gu Zhou’s voice grew deeper and hoarser. He said slowly, “Not good.”

“If we move away, only Grandma will be left here. I think Grandma will be very lonely.” Qiao Nian thought of Matriarch Gu and frowned slightly.

“No, the two children will stay with her.”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. Puzzled, she said, “Shouldn’t I bring the children with me?”

“I just want to be alone with you!” Gu Zhou’s voice was a little low and hoarse. He moved closer to Qiao Nian’s ear and gently bit her earlobe. “That way, there’ll only be you and me. You don’t have to restrain yourself anymore!”

The earlobe Gu Zhou had kissed was especially hot. The heat flowed through her blood and into every part of her body.

Qiao Nian recalled what had happened last night. At that time, she was worried that others would hear her, so she had been trying hard to restrain herself from making a sound.

What Gu Zhou meant was that if the two of them moved to the Dongjiang villa, she could say whatever she wanted?

Hooligan!

Qiao Nian took a deep breath. The current Gu Zhou had fused with Gu Chuan’s personality, which was why he wasn’t so domineering and paranoid.

She asked softly, “If it’s just the two of us over there, won’t you miss the children?”

Gu Zhou paused for a moment. “Yes.”

“Can we…”

Before Qiao Nian could finish speaking, Gu Zhou interrupted her. “But I want to be with you more!”

Qiao Nian gasped. She stared unblinkingly at Gu Zhou and said softly, “You’re already a father!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“It’s fine. We’ll just go during the day.” Gu Zhou smiled. His gaze lingered on Qiao Nian’s face as he said gently, “At the Dongjiang villa, we can also…”

Qiao Nian was very shy. The first two times they did it, Qiao Nian had her eyes closed and didn’t let him turn on the lights. He really wanted to see Qiao Nian’s face.

Qiao Nian sensed that Gu Zhou’s body had already changed. She hurriedly changed the topic and said, “It’s getting late. Perhaps the children have already woken up. Let’s hurry up and leave. We can’t wake up later than the children!”

“Do you want to go to the Dongjiang villa?”

Qiao Nian raised her eyebrows slightly and asked with interest, “Didn’t you want a child previously? Don’t tell me you no longer want a child and just want to spend some alone time with me?”

Gu Zhou smiled and lowered his head to kiss Qiao Nian’s forehead. Only then did he pull her into his arms forcefully.

Qiao Nian didn’t speak. She looked at Gu Zhou with a smile. She wanted to hear Gu Zhou’s answer.

“Who said I didn’t want a child?” Gu Zhou reached out and gently tapped Qiao Nian’s nose, asking dotingly.

“You just said that it would be just the two of us moving to the Dongjiang villa.”

“We can stay there on weekdays and come back on the weekends. We can accompany Grandma and the children then. Isn’t that good?”

Qiao Nian smiled and asked, “Have you thought about it long ago?”

“Yes!”

“But I think the two children really need us…”

“Nian’er.” Gu Zhou interrupted Qiao Nian and hugged her tightly. “Every one of us should have our own private space. The two of us need our own space, and so do the children. If we control the children too strictly, it won’t be good for their growth!”

Qiao Nian frowned slightly. For some reason, she actually felt that Gu Zhou’s words made sense.
