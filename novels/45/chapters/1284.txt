1285 Don’t be afraid

When Gu Zhou heard Xiao Bao’s words, his heart ached for him. He lowered his head and kissed Xiao Bao’s forehead, saying gently, “Yes, Dad will take care of everything else. Dad will never let you be hurt! Xiao Bao, don’t be afraid!”

When Xiao Bao heard the word “Dad”, his heart skipped a beat. He looked up at Gu Zhou and said proudly, “Dad, Xiao Bao is a little man. How can he be afraid? Daddy said that I’m a child of the Gu family. I have to learn to face everything bravely. I can’t be afraid!”

Dad?

Xiao Bao called him Dad.

Gu Zhou’s heart warmed. Looking at Xiao Bao’s arrogant expression, he praised, “Xiao Bao is really a good child!”

Xiao Bao nodded without any humility. He had always been the bravest child!

Qiao Nian’s lips curved up slightly. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Xiao Bao was really an obedient and lively child. He was probably the bravest child among the three children!

Qiao Nian touched Xiao Bao’s chubby face. Thinking of what Eldest Senior Brother had said to her, her expression became complicated.

In the past, she and Gu Zhou had always wanted to catch the people who had kidnapped her more than twenty years ago. At that time, they had always thought that those people wanted to hide the fact that they wanted to catch her to perform a bone marrow transplant on Song Man.

But now, she knew that MY’s HH Corporation had always wanted to annex the Gu and Lu families. Gu Yue had long known about this. Back then, he faked his death and turned into Mr. Chen, who stayed by Old Master Cui’s side to protect the Gu and Lu families.

Gu Yue’s situation was very dangerous, as if he was walking on thin ice.

Even so, Gu Yue still brought Xiao Bao along and taught him to be so brave.

Gu Yue was really a very capable person.

The bodyguards stood around Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian. The few of them hurriedly walked deeper into the amusement park.

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on the 5D theater not far away. “Why don’t we go there?”

During the day, they went to the 5D theater to have fun. When they were there, they noticed that there were many rooms. Moreover, it was easy to hide in the dark. It was the most suitable place to hide.

The group walked towards the theater.

Just as she reached the entrance of the theater, a man’s voice came from behind Gu Zhou.

“There they are!”

He turned around and saw a group of men in suits wearing jackal masks walking over. The sinister aura emitted by these people gradually spread towards the theater.

Gu Zhou knew them. Every time he came to MY, he would be pursued by these people.

Gu Zhou said coldly, “Let’s go!”

Gu Zhou led them in first. As soon as they entered, the bodyguards immediately closed the door, not forgetting to lock it.

The staff of the theater were all squatting in a corner, trembling and not daring to speak.

They had just walked in when the door of the theater was riddled with holes by HH Corporation’s bullets. One of the stray bullets even hit a bodyguard.

That bodyguard’s arm was injured. The other bodyguards helped him in and stopped the bleeding.

There were several exits to the theater. Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou and said in a low voice, “There aren’t many of us, so we’re no match for them. However, the room in the 5D theater is very big. Let’s lure them in directly. We can make a move from the operating room.”

Previously, Qiao Nian had noticed that it could rain heavily in this 5D theater. When they entered, they were all wearing raincoats.

Qiao Nian briefly explained the situation to Gu Zhou, then instructed the bodyguards to enter the control room.

As soon as he finished speaking, those people rushed in. Another person fired, and the already injured bodyguard fell to the ground.

The leader roared, “You fool! Who asked you to shoot? The higher-ups have already said that we have to catch him alive!”

When Qiao Nian heard that person’s words, she gave Gu Zhou a look and everyone entered the theater.

…

At Mr. Chen’s private villa by the sea.

Although there were no longer any photos of Xiao Bao in this villa, when Mr. Chen looked at everything here, Xiao Bao’s appearance appeared in his mind.

“Oh no!” Chang Feng walked to Mr. Chen’s side anxiously.

When Mr. Chen heard Chang Feng’s words, he subconsciously frowned. “What happened?”
