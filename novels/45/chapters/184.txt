Chapter 185: Are You My Mother?

Gu Zhou, who had been looking at the scenery outside the window, walked over. He took Qiao Nian’s hand, which had turned red from hitting Su Xue, and caressed it gently a few times before handing a dagger to Qiao Nian.

His hand was slightly hot, and the warmth traveled from Qiao Nian’s hand to every part of her body. Qiao Nian felt a warmth in her chest. She turned to look at Gu Zhou then slowly downwards, her gaze finally landing on the dagger in her hand.

The dagger was very exquisite. There was a circling golden dragon engraved on the handle, and a phoenix that had been reborn in flames was engraved on the blade.

“It’ll hurt if you use your bare hands.”

Gu Zhou’s deep voice came from above Qiao Nian’s head. His tone was disdainful, as if he didn’t take Qiao Nian’s slap on Su Xue seriously at all. At the same time, he seemed to be standing on Qiao Nian’s side, fully approving of her hitting Su Xue.

When Su Xue heard Gu Zhou’s words, her face turned red with anger. She glared fiercely at Qiao Nian and stood up in a rage. She wanted to slap Qiao Nian, but when her gaze fell on the dagger in Qiao Nian’s hand, she cowered.

Qiao Nian gripped the dagger in her hand tightly, her heart beating involuntarily faster. She looked into Gu Zhou’s eyes, falling into those bottomless eyes.

Su Xue was so frightened that her expression turned even uglier. She stepped back involuntarily and said with a trembling voice, “What… What do you want to do? I’m warning you. I’m your mother. This is a sin!”

Qiao Nian came back to her senses and lowered her gaze to hide her flusteredness. When she looked at Su Xue again, her eyes were filled with disdain. “Ha. Are you my mother?”

Su Xue looked at Qiao Nian in confusion.

“Whether or not you’re really my mother… I’m sure you know better than me.” Qiao Nian toyed with the dagger in her hand, her eyes narrowed.

Su Xue, who was sitting at the side, gasped. She looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief. Did Qiao Nian know everything?

How.

How was this possible? Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Su Xue began to tremble against her will.

Qiao Shan, who had been standing at the side, was also stunned when he heard Qiao Nian’s words. He didn’t expect Qiao Nian to know.

Qiao Xin looked at Qiao Nian in confusion.

Qiao Nian said coldly, “No mother of mine will bring such shame to the family name like you!”

Su Xue trembled slightly. She couldn’t guess what Qiao Nian was thinking. She stood there unmoving.

Qiao Nian glanced at Qiu Nan, who was curled up in a corner. She questioned, “When the matter was exposed, you were willing to send your little lover to prison just to protect yourself. Is it really as you said? Did he seduce you?”

Qiao Shan stared at Su Xue like a hawk.

Su Xue said anxiously, “Hubby, I really didn’t want to betray you. It really was he who seduced me!”

Qiao Nian sneered and shook her head slightly.

Seeing Qiao Nian like this, Su Xue said angrily, “Qiao Nian, what kind of expression is that? I’m your mother. Are you going to make a scene even when I’ve told the truth?”

“You really won’t give up. Must you hit a dead end before you turn back?” As Qiao Nian spoke, she took out her phone and played a recording.

Su Xue’s girlish, twittering voice. “Qiu Nan, what are you doing?”

“Sister Xue, what’s wrong?” Qiu Nan’s voice sounded normal.

“I’m so lonely. Qiao Shan works outside all day long, and he won’t spend time with me. I’m all alone. This house is so big, but it’s so cold!”

Qiu Nan said patiently, “Sister Xue, Mr. Qiao is working so hard for the sake of your family. If you think it’s boring to be alone, you can go shopping, watch movies, or even travel. You can also come to the gym to work out!”

“Sigh, there’s no point in shopping. As for traveling, I’ve been to all the famous places in the world.” Su Xue said coyly, “None of them are interesting.”

“Why don’t you come to the gym to work out? Exercise can help you forget all your worries. Moreover, women who work out look much younger than their peers.” Qiu Nan began to promote his gym services.

Su Xue said flirtatiously, “But… but I don’t dare…”

“Why?”

“Oh, when I see you, I feel as if I’ve returned to when I was young. I just want to… you know… I just can’t control myself…”
