The position she had been so proud of was actually stolen from Qiao Nian by Xia Xue.

This morning, she had even bragged shamelessly in front of Qiao Nian.

At the thought of this, Gao Lin felt even more humiliated.

Gao Lin carefully glanced at Qiao Nian, who was sitting not far away. Qiao Nian was calmly wiping her violin, as if she wasn’t angry at Xia Xue for stealing her spot.

When Gao Lin thought of what had happened in the training room, she took a deep breath.

Xia Xue was right. Since fate had brought Xia Xue and Brother Cao together, Qiao Nian could only blame herself for not being around.

When Gao Lin thought of Xia Xue, she frowned. She had to be more careful and stay away from Xia Xue. After all, Xia Xue was an imposter. The further away she was, the safer she would be.

Gao Lin was no longer willing to call Xia Xue Sister Xia Xue.

Although she was very ashamed of Xia Xue’s actions, she was now in the same boat as Xia Xue. Right now, she could only trample Qiao Nian under her feet, so that Qiao Nian would never be able to make a comeback. This way, no one would know that Xia Xue was an imposter.

Today’s incident was truly a close shave.

However, Gao Lin was still very jealous of Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian could play both the zither and the violin very well. Moreover, every time she played, she could infuse her soul into the tune, deeply touching the listeners!

This was something that even some outstanding musicians could not do.

How did Qiao Nian do it?

Gao Lin thought dazedly. Suddenly, she shook her head vigorously.

This wouldn’t do. How could she envy Qiao Nian?

Qiao Nian was just a wild girl from the countryside. Even if she had the ability, so what? Qiao Nian wasn’t meant to be successful.

In the end, Qiao Nian was just a stepping stone for Xia Xue.

Now that Xia Xue had successfully debuted, she would definitely think of a way to end Qiao Nian’s musical dream. No matter how talented Qiao Nian was, there was nothing she could do.

With this thought in mind, Gao Lin felt much better.

Qiao Nian placed the violin she had wiped into the case. She twirled the pen in her hand, feeling extremely happy.

Wang Xuan smiled at Qiao Nian and asked, “Just now, a senior came to look for me. She said that she wanted to invite you to the field tomorrow morning to improvise with everyone. What do you think?”

Wang Xuan’s words instantly attracted Gao Lin’s attention. She immediately pricked up her ears to listen.

“Sure, of course I’m willing to go to such a fun place!” Qiao Nian agreed readily. She had been worried that she wouldn’t be able to find a suitable opportunity to cause a scene. Since the heavens were willing to stand on her side, she naturally had to perform well.

Wang Xuan smiled and nodded. “Alright, I’ll reply to them now!”

As Gao Lin listened to Wang Xuan and Qiao Nian’s conversation, her heart began to race.

The two violin pieces Qiao Nian had played in the training room previously had already drawn many people to Qiao Nian’s side, and they hoped that Qiao Nian would become Mr. Dong Hua’s female musician.

If Qiao Nian played the violin for everyone on the field tomorrow, wouldn’t everyone in the school know that Qiao Nian’s violin skills were much better than Xia Xue’s?

Perhaps someone with ulterior motives would even realize that Xia Xue was an imposter.

At the thought of this, Gao Lin began to lose her composure.

Then her plan with Xia Xue would have to be brought forward.

When school ended in the evening, Qiao Nian had just walked out of the school gates and was about to take a taxi home when she saw a Bentley driving towards her. It stopped steadily in front of her. When she looked at the license plate number, she was slightly stunned and surprised.

The car window wasn’t rolled down. Qiao Nian couldn’t see what was going on in the car from the outside, but she was certain that he had arrived.

Qiao Nian opened the door behind her and got into the car. She saw him leaning lazily against the seat, playing with his pendant. There seemed to be a trace of danger around him.

Chen Qing, who was sitting in the driver’s seat, greeted softly, “Madam.”

“Where are we going?”

“Second Young Master said…”

Before Chen Qing could finish speaking, Gu Zhou interrupted him.

“It’s on the way to pick you up.”
