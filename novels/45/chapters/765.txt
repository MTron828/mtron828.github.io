766 Thank You

“Sister, let’s go wash our hands now!” Gu Qi’s heart ached when he saw his sister staring at the dishes on the dining table.

His sister must have had a hard time in the past.

Holding Xiao Shi’s hand, Gu Qi walked towards the bathroom. After the two of them washed their hands, he returned to the dining table.

Smiling, Qiao Nian called them over for dinner. Then, she picked up another piece of chicken for Gu Qi and Xiao Shi and placed it in the bowl of rice.

Xiao Shi looked up at Qiao Nian and said politely, “Thank you, Auntie Nian Nian!”

“You don’t have to be so polite. Hurry up and eat!”

Qiao Nian smiled gently at Xiao Shi, but her heart ached.

Why had such an obedient and adorable child suffered so much in the past? If she hadn’t suffered, she wouldn’t have been covered in calluses at such a young age.

However, her father did not know that she existed.

Qiao Nian sighed in her heart, but she didn’t show it on her face. She smiled at Xiao Shi and asked gently, “Xiao Shi, after dinner, I’ll bring you home with me!”

When Xiao Shi heard Qiao Nian’s words, she jumped down from her chair in excitement. She quickly walked up to Qiao Nian and asked seriously, “Auntie Nian Nian, is what you said true?”

Seeing how excited Xiao Shi was, a trace of sadness flashed in Gu Qi’s eyes.

His sister had always been thinking about her father in the past, but her father did not know of her existence. She worked hard to support herself and Mommy in Hai Cheng alone.

His sister had it really hard!

Qiao Nian smiled and nodded. She said gently, “Of course it’s true. How could I lie to you about this?” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Then are we going to see Daddy now?”

As soon as Xiao Shi finished speaking, her stomach growled inappropriately.

A shy smile appeared on Xiao Shi’s face.

Qiao Nian stood up and pulled Xiao Shi to the seat. She asked softly, “Auntie is especially hungry. Can you eat with me first?”

Xiao Shi nodded obediently. She knew in her heart that Auntie Nian Nian wanted her to eat first.

Qiao Nian walked back to her seat and sat down. Smiling at Xiao Shi, she said, “Xiao Shi, there’s something I want to discuss with you first.”

When she heard Qiao Nian’s words, she put down her chopsticks and stared unblinkingly at her.

Qiao Nian voiced her thoughts. “Xiao Shi, your daddy hasn’t gone to look for you in the past, not because he doesn’t care about you, but because he doesn’t know of your existence. Therefore, this time, can you pretend to be Xiao Qi and return to the Gu family with me?”

Xiao Shi blinked in confusion and asked in confusion, “Auntie Nian Nian, do you want me to pretend to be Brother Xiao Qi?”

Qiao Nian smiled and nodded. She continued, “I don’t know if you’re willing, but I want your father to slowly accept you.”

Xiao Shi felt that Auntie Nian Nian’s words were a little strange. She didn’t know what to do either. She looked at Gu Qi, who was sitting at the side, for help.

If her brother did not agree, she would not go back to acknowledge her father.

Qiao Nian also looked at Gu Qi, waiting for his answer.

Gu Qi nodded without hesitation. “Auntie Nian Nian, I thought so too!”

Gu Qi knew that his father did not know of the existence of Xiao Shi. If she returned home rashly, he was worried that his father would be cold to her.

If that was the case, Xiao Shi might be disappointed.

He wanted Xiao Shi to feel fatherly love.

Gu Qi turned to look at Xiao Shi and said seriously, “After dinner, go home with Auntie Nian Nian!”

When Xiao Shi heard Gu Qi’s words, she nodded obediently.

Since her brother agreed with Auntie Nian Nian’s suggestion, she didn’t have to worry about anything.

At the thought of this, Xiao Shi couldn’t help but smile.

Gu Qi looked at the bright smile on Xiao Shi’s face and couldn’t help but feel a trace of envy.

Her sister could see her daddy now, but he didn’t know when she would see her mommy.

How great would it be if he could also dress up as his sister to meet his mommy!
