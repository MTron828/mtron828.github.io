Chapter 288: How Much Do You Want?

There were only four people left in the entire training room.

Xia Xue looked at Brother Cao’s assistant uneasily. She didn’t understand why Brother Cao’s assistant had stopped Qiao Nian.

Lu Nian secretly gave Brother Cao a look. Brother Cao instantly understood.

Brother Cao turned to look at Xia Xue and said with a smile, “Go to the 22nd training room and practice now. When the time comes, record yourself. I’ll listen to it again.”

Xia Xue wasn’t sure what was going on either, but since Brother Cao had said so, she couldn’t refuse. She could only walk towards the training room next door uneasily.

After Xia Xue left, and only the three of them were left in the room, Brother Cao looked at Qiao Nian. He crossed his arms and spoke in the tone of a domineering CEO. “Tell me, how much do you want?”

Qiao Nian looked at Brother Cao in confusion.

Lu Nian couldn’t help but hit Brother Cao on the head. He said with disdain, “What nonsense are you spouting?”

Brother Cao looked at Lu Nian in disbelief and said with dissatisfaction, “What are you doing? You’re messing up my hairstyle. You don’t know anything about fashion!”

“Didn’t I tell you to pay attention to Qiao Nian?”

At the mention of this, Brother Cao’s expression turned serious. “Of course I did!”

“Have you noticed, then?”

“Of course I noticed!” Seeing Qiao Nian’s confused expression, Brother Cao turned to look at Lu Nian and nodded.

“Then what did you notice?”

Brother Cao said with an aggrieved expression, “Doesn’t she just want to climb into your bed? I’ve already noticed her. All I want to do now is give her a sum of money and send her away.”

Qiao Nian was shocked.

What climbing into his bed?

Why was there such a huge accusation?

Qiao Nian felt even more wronged than Dou E [1. Main character who was framed in the Chinese book The Injustice to Dou E].

Lu Nian was speechless.

Brother Cao realized that there was something wrong with their expressions. Suddenly, he was no longer certain of his guess. He tidied his hairstyle and asked with a sheepish smile, “Did I say anything wrong? Don’t I understand what you mean?”

Qiao Nian’s expression instantly darkened. She couldn’t help but retort, “You’re a top manager, after all. What kind of nonsense is in your head!”

Brother Cao’s eyes widened in disbelief. “How… how dare you scold me?”

“Did she say anything wrong?” Lu Nian raised his eyebrows slightly.

Brother Cao clutched his chest and took a step back. He was dumbfounded. He didn’t expect Lu Nian to help an outsider scold him. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“You’re actually helping an outsider?”

Brother Cao’s heart was bleeding.

“With your intelligence, how did you become a top manager?” Lu Nian asked seriously.

Hearing Lu Nian’s question, Brother Cao instantly felt extremely aggrieved. “All these years, I’ve done everything perfectly for you. You were the one who asked me to pay attention to her. Of course I did.”

“I’m asking you to keep an eye on her abilities, not ban her!” Lu Nian said helplessly.

“Huh?” Brother Cao was a little confused.

However, Brother Cao quickly came back to his senses. His eyes widened as he asked curiously, “Could she be the person you’ve been looking for?”

“Your intelligence has finally returned home.”

Brother Cao was shocked.

Holy shit.

What had he just done?

He had almost banned Qiao Nian.

Brother Cao’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian and Lu Nian’s faces. The two of them were echoing each other, as if they already knew each other.

Oh my god, hadn’t he just missed the best opportunity to replace that toad Xia Xue?

Brother Cao’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. Her palm-sized face was exquisite and bright, and her lips were delicate. Her fox-like eyes were soul-stirring, as if she possessed an indescribable nobility. She also had a mature charm that was different from her peers.

Although she didn’t look like someone who would climb into bed, but the way she looked was too unsafe.

He couldn’t be blamed for getting the wrong idea.

Who would have thought that such a good-looking person would be so talented?
