Zhao Qian came back to her senses with a jolt. Still wearing an elegant smile, she nodded. “Yes.”

Li Kun’s brow furrowed slightly, but it quickly cleared. He said, “Chen Qing is Gu Zhou’s secretary and bodyguard. He came to pick Miss Qiao up personally. Miss Zhao, what exactly is your Second Brother’s relationship with Miss Qiao?”

A trace of panic flashed in Zhao Qian’s eyes.

She could not tell anyone about Second Brother’s marriage. Otherwise, when she married Second Brother, others would ridicule her for being his second wife.

Zhao Qian’s mind raced. She gave a faint smile and said gently, “Sister Qiao has good medical skills. Grandma’s legs haven’t been well lately. Sister Qiao has been the one helping with the treatment. Now, Sister Qiao is also helping Second Brother with his illness.”

She knew medicine?

She was so outstanding, and she had such an interesting soul.

At this moment, Li Kun felt that she was the other half he was looking for.

His heart was beating faster and faster.

Li Kun turned to look at Zhao Qian and said, “Miss Zhao, although my next request is very presumptuous, I still want to ask if you can give me Miss Qiao’s contact information.”

The smile on Zhao Qian’s face did not change. However, her heart had already sunk to the bottom. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

‘When Zhao Qian returned home, the sky had already turned dark. When she heard from the servant that it was time for dinner, she took the initiative to go upstairs to invite Matriarch Gu to dine with her.

At this moment, Matriarch Gu was painting in the study. When she saw Zhao Qian, she hurriedly put down the brush in her hand and called Zhao Qian over. “Qian Qian, come over and take a look. What do you think of my painting?”

Zhao Qian smiled and walked over. She greeted, “Grandma.” Her gaze fell on the painting on Matriarch Gu’s desk. She looked at the lotus flowers in the painting and smiled.

“Grandma’s painting is simply amazing. The layout of this lotus flower painting is unrestrained and imposing, The general air of the painting is one of risk but with a firm foundation, and carries limitless vitality. The strokes are unbelievably powerful and strong, and the composition is amazing. The

aesthetic effect is obvious. This is a rare masterpiece.” Zhao Qian smiled at Matriarch Gu and said admiringly, “Grandma, you can even become a great artist in Chinese painting now.”

“This child. Your mouth is as sweet as honey.” Matriarch Gu looked at Zhao Qian with a happy smile and pointed at the pair of mandarin ducks in the river. “This is what I wanted you to see.”

Zhao Qian blushed slightly when she saw the birds.

“When you get married, this painting will be framed and hung in your new home.” Matriarch Gu looked at her painting in satisfaction. Her gaze fell on Zhao Qian’s face and she asked, “How was your blind date this time?”

Hearing Matriarch Gu’s words, Zhao Qian hesitated. She did not speak.

Matriarch Gu’s smile faded. She looked worriedly at Zhao Qian and asked, “Did he not make an appearance?”

Zhao Qian hurriedly shook her head and said, “Mr. Li doesn’t seem to be interested in me.”

When Matriarch Gu heard this, she was stunned. Zhao Qian had grown up by her side and was raised single-handedly by her. How could Li Kun not be interested in Zhao Qian?

She had been taking note of Li Kun for a long time and felt that he was outstanding in every way. That was why she had arranged for Zhao Qian to go on a blind date with him.

However, Matriarch Gu could not ask why directly. Still, she would feel uncomfortable if she didn’t know. She could not help but ask, “Did he say something awful?”

Zhao Qian lowered her gaze in embarrassment. Biting her lip, she shook her head and said, “He’s just… Second Sister-in-law…”

Matriarch Gu was confused.

Zhao Qian explained, “Second Sister-in-law was also at the cafe at that time. She wanted to meet someone with the surname Li, so she mistook Li Kun for the gentleman she wanted to meet. Li Kun also thought that she was me, and he…”

Towards the end, Zhao Qian lowered her head and said, “He’s taken a liking to Second Sister-in-law.”

When Matriarch Gu heard Zhao Qian’s words, she instantly understood. She smiled and took hold of Zhao Qian’s hand. “It’s fine. Grandma will pick another good choice for you, and introduce him to you..”
