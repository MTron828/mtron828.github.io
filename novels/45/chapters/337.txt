Chapter 338: Fury

When Qin Lu heard Qiao Nian’s words, the smile on her face instantly disappeared, and was replaced by an impatient tone. “So you’re Gu Qi’s mother?”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. So Qin Lu didn’t know Gu Qi’s mother.

However, it wasn’t appropriate for Qiao Nian to be Gu Qi’s mother. She was afraid that she would expose herself later. She casually came up with an identity and said, “I’m his aunt.”

When Qin Lu heard this, she instantly understood. She said coldly, “Madam Gu, your child has a particularly bad temper. She steals his classmates’ toys, doesn’t do his homework, and has autism. His behavior will affect the other children.”

Qiao Nian’s eyes turned cold. Without changing her expression, she asked, “So, Teacher Qin, what do you think we should do?”

Qin Lu glanced at Gu Zhou, then at Qiao Nian. Seeing that Qiao Nian seemed to genuinely want to listen to her suggestion, a cold smile flashed in her eyes.

What a stupid parent.

No wonder. This child was just a security guard’s child. How smart could his parents be?

Qin Lu pretended to look helpless. He sighed and said, “I suggest that you send him directly to a school for the disabled! The teachers there will give him some special education. This way, Gu Qi’s little habits will be cured. In another three to five years, his IQ will also be as high as a three-year-old’s!”

Qiao Nian bit her lip. In the end, she couldn’t help but slap Qin Lu without hesitation.

Qin Lu’s face instantly burned with pain. She looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief. She couldn’t understand why this woman would suddenly fly into a rage and hit her.

“How… how dare you hit me?”

The crisp sound of the slap attracted all the children in the classroom. They looked over.

Especially Gu Qi. His eyes were shining with a strange light. He couldn’t believe that someone would protect him. He tried hard to keep his eyes open, worried that this was just a dream. What if everything was fake when he woke up?

Gu Qi involuntarily tightened his grip on the nine Chinese rings.

Qiao Nian sneered and said, “I’ve already hit you lightly. What right do you have to accuse my child of having autism? What right do you have to say that my child doesn’t speak? What right do you have to say that my child’s intelligence isn’t high? If you didn’t abuse him, why wouldn’t he speak? You useless teacher!”

Qin Lu’s face turned pale. He said in exasperation, “Of course I’m saying this for Gu Qi’s sake. He’s clearly a mute who doesn’t know how to speak. You’re too much. Aren’t you going to let me speak the truth?”

Qiao Nian raised her eyebrow and said coldly, “If our Gu Qi goes to a special school, his future will be tainted. He will also be labeled as a retard. This will affect his reputation for the rest of his life. I’ve already hit you lightly, yet you still have the cheek to refute me?”

Qin Lu was so angry that she laughed. She questioned, “He’s a retard and a mute to begin with. As a parent, aren’t you being too unreasonable? Why won’t you let me speak?”

“Gu Qi, come here!” Qiao Nian ignored Qin Lu’s anger and spoke to Gu Qi, who was sitting in the classroom.

Gu Qi ran up to Qiao Nian and looked up, his eyes sparkling. He greeted sweetly, “Aunt.”

Gu Qi’s greeting shocked everyone. Qin Lu’s face instantly turned pale, and cold sweat broke out on her back.

How was this possible?

No, this was impossible.

Gu Qi should be a retard.

Gu Qi should have been mute.

Qiao Nian’s anger dissipated. She smiled at Gu Qi and said gently, “Gu Qi, tell Auntie what happened just now.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Gu Qi stood there and explained clearly, “That classmate tried to snatch the nine Chinese rings from me just now. I didn’t want to give them to her, so she cried. She even said that I bullied her. Then, when the teacher came over, she scolded me without distinguishing between right and wrong. She even forced me to return the nine Chinese rings to that classmate.”
