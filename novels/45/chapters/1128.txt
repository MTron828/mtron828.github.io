1129 Lunatic

Previously, when Jiang Chi found out that Lu Zhu had gone to MY, he got someone to kidnap him. At that time, she knew that Jiang Chi was not afraid of the Lu family at all.

Moreover, Jiang Chi was a lunatic. Ordinary people could not stoop to the level of a lunatic.

Qiao Nian didn’t even dare to imagine if Lu Qi had really gone to see Jiang Cheng if Qin Chuan had arrived a little later…

The hatred in Qiao Nian’s eyes grew more and more obvious. She yearned to kill Jiang Chi!

Gu Zhou sensed Qiao Nian’s killing intent. He walked over to her and held her hand.

Qiao Nian’s clenched hand slowly opened. She grabbed Gu Zhou’s hand and turned to look at him.

Gu Zhou nodded at Qiao Nian and looked at Jiang Chi coldly. “You’re really bold!”

If Jiang Chi was acting recklessly, he didn’t mind letting the tank blow up his ghost city!

Qiao Nian looked at Jiang Chi and smiled coldly. She said sarcastically, “I really didn’t expect you to already have designs on my biological sister. Do you think I’m easy to bully?”

When Jiang Chi heard Qiao Nian’s words, he looked up at her. He could tell that Qiao Nian was really angry. He clenched his right fist gently and said in a low voice, “I just want to fulfill my brother’s wish. I’ve never thought of hurting your sister. You should understand. My feelings for my brother are equally strong. It’s like how you want to protect your sister, but…”

Jiang Chi paused for a moment, his gaze landing on Lu Qi’s face. “Lu Qi is a member of the Lu family. How can she be your sister?”

He said this because he wanted an explanation from Qiao Nian.

“How can you not know that she’s my sister? She clearly…” Before Qiao Nian could finish speaking, her beautiful fox-like eyes narrowed slightly. “Do you really not know?”

Jiang Chi looked at Qiao Nian calmly and raised his eyebrows slightly. “I came to An City to look for someone called Qi Qi. I didn’t expect her to be Lu Zhu’s sister. Lu Zhu killed my brother, so his sister married my brother. This can be considered repayment for his mistake! I’m already very kind to him!”

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze slightly and frowned. She muttered softly, “Strange. Logically speaking, you should know. Didn’t Jiang Cheng tell you?”

Everyone looked at Qiao Nian and heard her muttering. They were all filled with surprise!

Qiao Nian pursed her lips slightly. At this moment, she had already forgotten to be angry. Her mind was filled with what Jiang Chi had just said. She looked at him and asked, “Then have you heard of the eldest daughter of the Lu family?”

Jiang Cheng and Jiang Chi had a good relationship. Logically speaking, if Jiang Cheng found out that the eldest daughter of the Lu family was not dead, he should have told Jiang Chi.

Jiang Chi looked at Qiao Nian without changing his expression. “The eldest daughter of the Lu family died more than twenty years ago. Her death shocked the entire world. Who wouldn’t know?”

Qiao Nian gasped.

Indeed, Jiang Cheng did not tell Jiang Chi about this!

Why? Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Although Jiang Chi did not have many connections in An City, if Jiang Cheng really wanted to repay his brother, he could ask Jiang Chi for help. At that time, Jiang Cheng could find out who the eldest daughter of the Lu family was earlier!

According to the diary of Jiang Cheng, he died a few days after he discovered that the eldest daughter of the Lu family was still alive. Jiang Cheng should have had a chance to tell Jiang Chi!

Unless Jiang Cheng was already being targeted at that time and he did not have a chance to tell Jiang Chi.

Only Jiang Cheng knew that the eldest daughter of the Lu family was still alive!

Perhaps it was precisely because of this that Jiang Cheng had attracted a fatal disaster!

Qiao Nian gradually lowered her gaze, a trace of sorrow flashing in her eyes.

Jiang Chi wanted to ask Qiao Nian about clues about his younger brother, but seeing Qiao Nian’s sorrowful expression, he couldn’t say anything!

Qiao Nian finally regained her composure. She looked up at Jiang Chi and asked, “Gu Yue disappeared six years ago. Have you seen him again?”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s question, there was a trace of nervousness in his eyes. He stared unblinkingly at Jiang Chi.

Jiang Chi frowned, not understanding why Qiao Nian was asking him these strange questions. He shook his head gently. “I haven’t seen him since he disappeared!”
