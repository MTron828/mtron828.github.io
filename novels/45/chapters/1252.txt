1253 Surprise

Qiao Nian frowned and said in surprise, “Ah, so it was the bullet that hit the back of the bodyguard’s hand. It’s actually a steel bullet. If I hadn’t seen two black shadows shooting in from different directions, I might have thought that you had hit Takeda alone.”

“Logically speaking, there are many people with guns here, but there shouldn’t be many people who use steel bullets as bullets!” Gu Zhou said with a frown.

Qiao Nian nodded in agreement, playing with the steel bullet in her hand. She suddenly realized that Eldest Senior Brother might be protecting her from behind.

But that didn’t make sense either. She had just separated from Eldest Senior Brother. From what Eldest Senior Brother said, he seemed to be being followed and couldn’t disappear for too long. According to this logic, the owner of the steel bullet shouldn’t be Eldest Senior Brother.

However, it might really be Eldest Senior Brother. Eldest Senior Brother might have passed by and happened to save her.

Qiao Nian stared at the steel bullet carefully. There were some strange patterns engraved on it.

Qiao Nian smiled at Gu Zhou and said, “I think it might be Eldest Senior Brother, but I’m not sure. Perhaps Qin Chuan’s men are also protecting me in the dark.”

As Qiao Nian spoke, she took out her phone and contacted Chang Feng through a hacker.

Before long, Chang Feng sent a message.

Qiao Nian gripped her cell phone tightly. She glanced at Gu Zhou and said, “I’ve already asked Eldest Senior Brother. He said it wasn’t him.”

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but be puzzled. She didn’t know who was helping her in the dark. No matter what, she should thank him.

“We can slowly investigate the owner of the steel bullet in the future.” With that, Gu Zhou paused for a moment and continued, “You met Chang Feng today. Then what did the two of you say?”

If Gu Zhou hadn’t mentioned this, Qiao Nian would have forgotten about it.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou belatedly and said, “I almost forgot about the serious matter!”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he couldn’t help but feel nervous.

Qiao Nian reached out and held Gu Zhou’s hand. With a serious expression, she said, “Ah Zhou, your feelings for Mr. Chen weren’t wrong. Mr. Chen is really your big brother!”

Chen Qing, who was driving, was so frightened that he stepped on the brakes. However, Chen Qing quickly recovered. He had never expected Mr. Chen to really be the eldest young master of the Gu family. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Chen Qing recalled what had happened to him and Gu Zhou in MY the last time. He instantly came to a realization. He looked at Gu Zhou through the rearview mirror and said, “Previously, when we were being chased here, a group of people appeared to help us stop those people. Could those people be Mr. Chen’s men? No, it’s Eldest Young Master…”

Gu Zhou’s expression was calm as he looked ahead with a deep gaze. His throat moved involuntarily, and he held Qiao Nian’s hand tightly.

Qiao Nian looked down at Gu Zhou’s hand. She knew in her heart that the more excited Gu Zhou was, the more silent he appeared.

Qiao Nian interlocked her fingers with Gu Zhou’s and comforted him softly. “Actually, you’ve misunderstood your brother. It’s not that he doesn’t want to acknowledge you, but he can’t.”

Qiao Nian’s words soothed the unease in Gu Zhou’s heart.

Gu Zhou also understood that his brother was pretending to be Mr. Chen and was in danger at all times. The fewer people who knew his identity, the safer he would be.

The reason why Big Brother did not appear this time was probably to protect him.

Gu Zhou recalled how he had taken the liberty to call his brother yesterday. He really wanted to confirm his guess, but he now realized that if he said a few more words and let those people know his brother’s identity, he would only put him in danger.

Fortunately, her brother was still alive. Their family would still be reunited, and they would not be sad because his brother’s whereabouts were unknown.
