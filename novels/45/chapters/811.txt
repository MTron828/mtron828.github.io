812 Flipping Through the Diary

At that time, she was still a student. She found out that she had been saved by her biological brother, but her biological brother hid her identity.

Ha!

At the thought that Qiao Yu had feelings for her, her expression turned even uglier.

Qiao Nian thought for a while and prepared to tear off this page of the diary. She didn’t want to see anything about Qiao Yu at all.

Qiao Nian scrolled down until she reached her six-year-old birthday. She couldn’t help but smile.

At that time, she had always envied other children for being able to eat cake on their birthdays.

After her grandfather found out about this, he took her to the county city to buy a cake.

At that time, she was still young. She had always thought that as long as it was a round pastry, it would be a cake. Hence, when she passed by a shop selling snacks, she asked for a large cake and brought it home.

When she was about to put in the candles at night, she realized that the cake shop had not given her any.

At the time, she had thought that it was fine if there were no candles. Anyway, there were many candles in the house.

Qiao Nian took out a candle and was about to celebrate her birthday when she saw Eldest Senior Brother covering his mouth and laughing.

Xiao Qiao Nian looked at Eldest Senior Brother in confusion and muttered softly, “Eldest Senior Brother, what are you laughing at? Doesn’t this cake look good?”

Eldest Senior Brother finally restrained his smile. “Junior Sister, how is this a cake? This is just a mooncake the size of a plate!”

When Qiao Nian saw this, the smile in her eyes grew.

At that time, she was too young to understand many things. When she bought the cake, she thought that this cake was a little short and would save her grandfather money.

Qiao Nian touched the diary. When she was six, she didn’t know how to write many words. She wrote them in pinyin, but this didn’t affect her reading.

Qiao Nian continued reading the diary. Recalling what had happened in the past, she couldn’t help but smile.

Suddenly, her phone began to ring.

Qiao Nian took out her phone and realized that she had been reading the diary for more than three hours.

Time passed so quickly.

“Where are you now?” Qiao Nian asked.

Qin Chuan’s voice came through the phone. “I’ve already arrived in An City. Where should I send Miss Song to now?”

When Qiao Nian heard Qin Chuan’s words, she closed the diary and said thoughtfully, “Send her to the Dongjiang villa!”

“When are you coming over, then?”

Qiao Nian frowned slightly and said, “It’s not convenient to see her now. Lin Tao is in Dongjiang now. She’ll help me receive Song Man.”

“Alright, I’ll send her to the Dongjiang villa now!”

After Qiao Nian hung up on Qin Chuan, she called Lin Tao.

Before Qiao Nian could speak, Lin Tao’s curious voice came through the phone.

“Nian Nian, where are you now? When will you be back?”

“Can you take care of them?”

“It’s just taking care of two children. Of course I can take care of them. Don’t you know who I am? I’m Lin Tao!” Lin Tao said proudly.

Qiao Nian smiled and continued, “In a while, Xiao Shi’s Mommy will probably arrive at your place. When the time comes, help me entertain her.”

A trace of confusion flashed in Lin Tao’s eyes. Puzzled, she asked, “Aren’t you coming back now?”

Qiao Nian glanced at the unfinished diary and continued, “I still have some things to do here. I’ll go over later.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Lin Tao lowered her gaze slightly. She felt that Qiao Nian was too kind. If she were in Qiao Nian’s shoes, she wouldn’t be willing to bring that woman over. After all, she wasn’t that magnanimous.

Although she didn’t want that woman to come over, she still liked these two children.

These two children were sensible, good, and extremely obedient.

However, of course, Lin Tao wouldn’t say these things in front of the two children or Qiao Nian. She believed that Qiao Nian must have her own reasons for doing this.

“Alright, then hurry over when you’re done.”

After Lin Tao hung up, she looked at Xiao Shi, who was playing a game on her phone. Smiling, she said, “Xiao Shi, you’ll be able to see your mommy soon!”

When Xiao Shi heard Lin Tao’s words, her eyes lit up. She asked expectantly, “Really?”
