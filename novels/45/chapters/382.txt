Chapter 383: Explanation

However, Qin Lu didn’t realize at all that she was hovering on the edge of danger. She was crying pitifully,and sobbing uncontrollably.

At this moment, the waiter sitting beside the sofa was trembling in fear. He had yet to react to what had happened, but the only thing he was sure of was that he might be impotent.

Li Kun looked at Qin Lu without changing his expression. His gaze became colder and colder as he questioned, “You’re innocent? Then tell me, why was the tea I drank drugged?”

Hearing Li Kun’s words, Qin Lu was slightly stunned. There were still tears on her face. She raised her hand to wipe them away and said aggrievedly, “How could there be drugs in Cousin’s tea? Even if you gave me a hundred times more guts, I wouldn’t dare to put drugs in your tea!”

Li Kun’s frown deepened.

“Cousin, you have to believe me. I really didn’t drug you. This tea…” Qin Lu stopped in the middle of her sentence. She pointed at Jiang Yue and said angrily,” Jiang Yue was the one who gave me the tea. She said that these were good tea leaves. I just wanted to give it to you. I wouldn’t dare to drug it! ”

At this moment, Qin Lu reacted and immediately stood up. She asked Jiang Yue loudly, “Why did you drug my tea leaves?”

Everyone’s attention was on Jiang Yue’s face.

Jiang Yue stood there with a calm expression, without a trace of panic on her face. Her red lips curled into a faint smile as she bit back, “Miss Qin Lu, what are you saying? Didn’t you say that you liked to drink tea a lot? I was just giving you my tea leaves. I really didn’t expect you to have planned so many things in advance. Now, you even want to drag me down with you. You’re deliberately making me your scapegoat. You’re simply too much!”

Jiang Yue’s words directly cleared her suspicion.

When Qin Lu heard Jiang Yue’s words, she was instantly stunned. She had never expected that Jiang Yue would be able to refute everything. Her face flushed red with anxiety, and she hurriedly explained, “Cousin, it’s not what Jiang Yue said at all. She was the one who asked me if I liked tea leaves first. She only gave me the tea leaves in her hand when I said that I liked them!”

After saying that, Qin Lu was so anxious that she was about to cry. Why did she feel that she was making things worse? Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Li Kun’s expression turned cold as he said sternly, “If I remember correctly, you don’t like tea at all!”

Jiang Yue chuckled and asked, “Miss Qin Lu, since you don’t like tea, why did you lie to me just now? Or have you already thought it through and wanted to push all the blame to me?”

“But Cousin, you like to drink tea!” Qin Lu did not even look at Jiang Yue. She looked at Li Kun pitifully and cried, “Cousin, I’m very grateful for Auntie and Cousin’s care for me and Mom all these years. When Jiang Yue gave me the tea leaves, my first reaction was to give them to you. If I had known that these tea leaves were drugged, I would never have given them to you even if I died!”

Tears streamed down Qin Lu’s face as her voice choked. “Cousin, you should know that my family is poor and can’t afford such good tea leaves!”

Jiang Yue looked at Qin Lu, who was crying pitifully, and said speechlessly, “I was kind enough to give you tea leaves, but you actually poured dirty water on me. Miss Qin Lu, you’re too much!”

Qiao Nian’s gaze landed on Jiang Yue’s face. Although there was no flaw in Jiang Yue’s words, she felt that what Qin Lu had just said was true.
