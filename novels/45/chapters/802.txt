803 Child Bride

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze, remaining silent.

Most people in that era were very superstitious. In order to let their sons have a smooth life, many rich families would find a child bride.

However, Qiao Nian felt that this matter was a little strange, but she couldn’t tell what was strange.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Su Xue’s face. She asked, “At that time, was there a token representing my identity in the school bag?”

“There’s no token. At that time, you were wearing tattered clothes and were covered in dirt. You were also injured. How could there be a token?” Su Xue waved her hand and said nonchalantly.

Su Xue wanted to improve her image in front of Qiao Nian. She added, “If it weren’t for me, you might have died long ago. As your savior, I don’t need you to repay me for saving your life now. Our relationship is even!”

When Qiao Nian heard Su Xue’s words, her eyes lit up.

Previously, she had always felt that something was wrong with this matter. Now, she finally knew.

Su Xue was an exquisite self-interested person. She clearly knew that she had narrowly escaped death. Wasn’t Su Xue afraid that her enemies would chase after her?

Back then, Su Xue could have casually spent money to buy a young lady to be Qiao Yu’s child bride. There was no need to take such a big risk to take her in, who was covered in injuries. Wasn’t Su Xue afraid that those people would attack her?

Qiao Nian didn’t think Su Xue would risk her life for her.

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but laugh.

Seeing Qiao Nian smile, Su Xue frowned slightly. Puzzled, she asked, “Why are you smiling now?”

With that, Su Xue met Qiao Nian’s half-smiling eyes. She had a bad feeling.

Could it be that Qiao Nian had already investigated the truth?

Did Qiao Nian come here today just to make a fool of herself?

At the thought of this, Su Xue’s expression gradually turned ugly. She said sternly, “Why are you looking at me like that? I don’t even intend for you to repay my kindness. I’ve already told you everything. Hurry up and leave. I don’t want to see you at home anymore!”

“I don’t believe what you’re saying. Why would you adopt me for the sake of Qiao Yu’s health?” After Qiao Nian said that, she paused for a moment and continued, “If I had really escaped death back then, I think you would have run as far away as possible for the sake of your life. Besides, it wouldn’t have cost much to buy a young lady in that era. How could you disregard your personal safety just to take care of me?”

Su Xue’s expression changed.

Qiao Nian was as smart as ever, but she wasn’t on the right path.

No one liked this little girl.

“If I really escaped death, according to your personality, you would probably throw me as far away as possible. You would even leave Soul City for your own safety. You would never bring me back to the Qiao family, let alone adopt me!” Qiao Nian looked at Su Xue with interest and asked, “What made you insist on taking me in? I hope you can tell the truth. If I find out that you’re lying, I think you’ll definitely have to bear the consequences in the future!”

Qiao Nian exuded a cold and oppressive aura. The entire living room seemed to have gone to the eighteenth level of hell. Su Xue shivered in fear.

At this moment, Su Xue realized that Qiao Nian was really too shrewd. No wonder Qiao Xin was no match for Qiao Nian every time.

Su Xue had wanted to portray herself as Qiao Nian’s life savior, but she hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to take advantage of the situation.

Qiao Nian was too smart.

Su Xue broke out in a cold sweat under Qiao Nian’s gaze. Seeing that it was getting late, she only wanted to get rid of Qiao Nian as soon as possible. She let out a long sigh and said, “You’re right. I’m indeed hiding something from you!”

Qiao Nian sat on the sofa, her expression unchanged. Her beautiful fox-like eyes were cold as she waited for Su Xue to continue. She wanted to see what else Su Xue could say.

Su Xue pursed her lips tightly, her expression ferocious. After a long time, she closed her eyes and said in despair, “I originally wanted to help you find your family. You looked very disheveled and I should have sent you to the police station. I could even help Qiao Yu accumulate merit!”
