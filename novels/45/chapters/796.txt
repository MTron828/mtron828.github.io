797 Missing You

Gu Qi’s little face was already scrunched up. He really hoped to be with Auntie Nian Nian forever.

Qiao Nian didn’t want Gu Qi to be so sad. She smiled and said, “Mom will come here at noon. She should be your mother too. When the time comes, you can get along well with your mother!”

When Gu Qi heard Qiao Nian’s words, he didn’t smile. He clenched his fists involuntarily.

For some reason, he wasn’t happy to hear that his mommy was coming.

He was a little afraid. He didn’t know what he was afraid of.

Qiao Nian thought that Gu Qi was more interested in being close to his hometown. She smiled and patted his head, saying gently, “When the time comes, get along well with Mom, understand?”

Gu Qi clearly didn’t say anything.

Qiao Nian gave Lin Tao a few more reminders before walking towards the car.

Gu Qi looked at Qiao Nian’s retreating back, and the uneasiness in his heart gradually grew. He took a step forward. “Auntie Nian Nian, goodbye!”

Xiao Shi waved vigorously at Qiao Nian. “Goodbye!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Nian smiled and turned to look at Gu Qi and Xiao Shi. She waved at the two of them, then walked to the car and drove away.

Gu Qi watched as Qiao Nian left, his heart empty. His frown deepened.

He had always hoped to find his mother. Now that his mother could finally return, he felt terrible.

In the past, he had thought that his mother could be with Auntie Nian Nian. Later on, he realized that his mother and Auntie Nian Nian could not be together. Not only that, but his mother and Auntie Nian Nian would be enemies.

Gu Qi’s heart was empty. If his mother returned, would Auntie Nian Nian leave?

If Auntie Nian Nian left, what would happen to him?

Xiao Shi and Gu Qi were twins. There was a blood connection between them. She sensed Gu Qi’s disappointment and walked over to him, reaching out to hold his small hand.

“Brother!” Xiao Shi looked at Gu Qi with a smile and asked softly, “Mommy is coming at noon. Are you nervous?”

Gu Qi looked at the bright smile on Xiao Shi’s face and hesitated for a moment. He nodded and said, “Yes, I’m ready. When the time comes, we’ll exchange identities like before. I’ll go and see Mommy on your behalf!”

Xiao Shi smiled and agreed. However, when she thought of Mommy, a trace of hesitation flashed across her eyes. She held Gu Qi’s hand tightly and instructed seriously, “Brother, Mommy is sick. Her mood is capricious. If she’s unhappy, don’t talk to her anymore. The consequences of Mommy being angry are very serious!”

Gu Qi frowned slightly and asked worriedly, “Will she hit you if she’s angry?”

When she heard Gu Qi’s question, the smile on her face froze. She didn’t answer Gu Qi directly. Instead, she smiled and changed the topic.

“Brother, last night, Dad actually didn’t realize that I was you. He was reading with me. Do you think Mom will realize that you’re me?”

“I don’t know!” Gu Qi felt very empty, as if he had lost something important.

…

About twenty minutes later, Qiao Nian had already driven to the Qiao residence.

She parked the car outside the villa and looked up at the Qiao family’s door, feeling as if a lifetime had passed.

She got out of the car. When the security guard saw Qiao Nian return, he quickly walked up to her and said with a smile, “Miss, you’re back!”

Qiao Nian nodded slightly.

She was not a member of the Qiao family at all!

Qiao Nian walked in and saw Su Xue standing in the garden, tending to the plants. A trace of coldness flashed across her eyes.

She didn’t expect Su Xue to be so capable. She had returned to the Qiao family home so quickly.

Su Xue naturally saw Qiao Nian as well. Seeing Qiao Nian smiling at her, her heart couldn’t help but jump to her throat. She asked warily, “You’re no longer a member of the Qiao family. How dare you come?”

Qiao Nian walked into the living room and sat leisurely on the sofa. She raised her eyebrows and looked at Su Xue, who had followed her in. Smiling, she said, “It’s been so long since we last met. Of course I missed you, so I came!”

“Do you want to see how badly you’ve hurt me?” Su Xue’s expression instantly darkened. She gritted her teeth and said, “You’ve already seen it for yourself. I’m already in a terrible state. Can you leave now?”
