785 Eavesdropping

In her childhood impression, Auntie Nian Nian had always been a very serious person. She had never expected Auntie Nian Nian to do such fun things when she was young.

Outside the door.

Gu Zhou stood there silently.

He wanted to come in to see if Gu Qi was asleep, but Qiao Nian had arrived first.

!!

Just as he reached the door, he heard Gu Qi’s laughter.

He carefully pushed the door open, revealing a crack.

Through the gap, he saw Qiao Nian and Gu Qi under the same blanket. At this moment, Gu Qi was trembling with laughter.

This was the first time he had seen Gu Qi like this. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

It seemed that Qiao Nian really liked Gu Qi a lot, which was why she had changed his personality in such a short period of time.

This warm scene was probably what Gu Qi had dreamed of in the past!

However, he did not know how long this warmth would last.

If possible, he hoped that Qiao Nian and Gu Qi would be happy for the rest of their lives.

At this moment, two people’s voices came from inside the room.

“Auntie Nian Nian, your senior brother is really too cute. What’s his name?”

“Chang Feng!”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s answer, the warmth on Gu Zhou’s face instantly disappeared, and his eyes turned cold.

“Chang Feng!”

Gu Zhou thought of the man in the black suit who had been standing beside his brother.

He was Big Brother’s bodyguard.

He could risk everything for his brother, even if it meant death.

Could the Chang Feng Qiao Nian was talking about be his brother’s bodyguard?

No, it shouldn’t be.

He still remembered the video of Qiao Xin being kidnapped. When he showed it to Qiao Nian, she was also there. She didn’t recognize the man in the video at all.

At that time, Qiao Nian’s face was expressionless, and her gaze was very calm, as if that man had nothing to do with her.

Was it just because their names were the same?

It made sense. There were too many people with the same name in this world.

It should just be a coincidence.

Xiao Shi stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian and asked innocently, “Auntie Nian Nian, how are you and your eldest senior brother now?”

Hearing Xiao Shi’s question, Qiao Nian’s eyes flickered. She sighed softly and said, “When he was fifteen, he left Grandpa’s house. I haven’t seen him since.”

Qiao Nian pursed her lips slightly. She hadn’t seen Eldest Senior Brother in so many years. Even if they met now, she probably wouldn’t recognize him.

In the past, she had thought of looking for her senior brothers, but she couldn’t find them no matter what. It was only then that she realized that if her senior brothers didn’t want to appear, she wouldn’t be able to find them.

Hence, she did not look for them.

Four years ago, she was still in the mental hospital. At that time, all her attention was on the plants. Just as she was taking care of them, she received a letter from Eldest Senior Brother.

This was because the letter contained Eldest Senior Brother’s personal seal and his token.

The letter Eldest Senior Brother had written was mainly to ask her for a favor.

He wanted her to treat the Second Young Master of the Gu family, Gu Zhou.

Eldest Senior Brother was especially close to her. In addition, Eldest Senior Brother had once saved her. It was precisely because of this that she had no intention of rejecting Eldest Senior Brother’s request.

When she was in the mental hospital, she had begun to study Gu Zhou’s illness.

She felt that no matter how much she studied, it was better to look at the patient’s health directly. She had been thinking about how to get close to Gu Zhou.

There was no such thing as a coincidence. Before she could make a plan, the Qiao family forced her to marry in their stead.

This method sounded a little unreliable, but according to her investigation, Gu Zhou was a cautious person and did not like to interact with outsiders.

Moreover, she had already tried to get close to Gu Zhou, but she had failed.

Qiao Nian had no choice but to agree to the marriage. Although this matter was a little strange, she could openly treat Gu Zhou’s illness. Moreover, Gu Zhou wouldn’t suspect that she had been entrusted by someone.

After she married into the Gu family, she wanted to investigate the relationship between Eldest Senior Brother and Gu Zhou, but in the end, she had found nothing.

She specially asked some of the old servants of the Gu family. Those servants had worked in the Gu family for more than twenty years. She showed them photos of Eldest Senior Brother in the past, but they all said that they had never seen him.
