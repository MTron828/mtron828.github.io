Did she need protection while sleeping?

Qiao Nian also knew that she couldn’t reason with him now. She nodded helplessly and said, “Okay.”

When Zhou Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, a happy smile appeared on his face. Taking the initiative, he led Qiao Nian upstairs.

When they reached the room, Zhou Zhou reluctantly let go of Qiao Nian’s hand and closed the door. When he turned back, he smiled at Qiao Nian and said happily, “Nian Nian, Zhou Zhou will take a shower. Zhou Zhou will help Nian Nian take a shower!”

Qiao Nian was speechless.

Qiao Nian was stunned for a moment before saying, “There’s no need. I can shower myself.”

“Nian Nian, Zhou Zhou will take good care of you.” Zhou Zhou looked at Qiao Nian seriously and said with concern, “Zhou Zhou can help Nian Nian wash up.”

If it were any other man, she would have left long ago.

But the person standing in front of her was Zhou Zhou.

Suppressing her anger, Qiao Nian said gently, “Zhou Zhou, men and women shouldn’t touch each other. We’ll just take our own showers.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Zhou Zhou tilted his head and said disapprovingly, “Not good. Last time, Nian Nian helped Zhou Zhou take a shower. Zhou Zhou wants to help Nian Nian take a shower too.”

Before Qiao Nian could speak, she saw Zhou Zhou walking towards the bathroom.

“Nian Nian, I’ll go fill the bathtub.”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she sighed helplessly. Suddenly, a thought flashed across her mind. She hurriedly said, “Zhou Zhou.”

“Huh?” Zhou Zhou stopped in his tracks and looked at Qiao Nian in confusion. He asked curiously, “Nian Nian?”

“I’ve already taken a shower before I picked you up, so I don’t have to take a shower anymore.” Qiao Nian didn’t want Zhou Zhou to help her shower. No matter what, Zhou Zhou’s body was still that of a grown man.

When Zhou Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he nodded slightly, his eyes filled with disappointment. However, his eyes quickly lit up again as he asked expectantly, “Nian Nian, help Zhou Zhou take a shower!”

Qiao Nian was shocked!

She narrowed her eyes slightly. For some reason, she felt that Zhou Zhou was not that innocent.

Could it be that Zhou Zhou wanted her to take a shower with him?

Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat. Zhou Zhou had gone astray.

However, Zhou Zhou was just one of Gu Zhou’s personalities. Usually, no one taught him right from wrong.

Qiao Nian frowned slightly. Although Zhou Zhou was very obedient, he was still an adult. It wouldn’t be good for her to see his body.

Zhou Zhou didn’t seem to understand what Qiao Nian was thinking. He tilted his head and asked in confusion, “Nian Nian, are you despising Zhou Zhou?”

“No,” Qiao Nian said subconsciously.

“Then Nian Nian will also bathe Zhou Zhou, right?” Zhou Zhou asked happily.

Qiao Nian was speechless.

When did she say that she wanted to help him take a shower?

Perhaps it was because of Qiao Nian’s silence, but the light in Zhou Zhou’s eyes gradually disappeared. His pure eyes flickered as he looked at Qiao Nian, as if he was hurt. He asked, “Nian Nian, can you help Zhou Zhou take a shower?”

At this moment, Qiao Nian noticed that Zhou Zhou was very good at reading people’s expressions. He could clearly judge the expression on her face. Then, he would retreat in order to advance, and act cute to get everything he wanted.

Actually, Qiao Nian didn’t think it was a big deal to bathe Zhou Zhou. At most, she would just let Zhou Zhou wear his underwear.

However, what worried her was what if Gu Chuan ran out when she was bathing Zhou Zhou.

Gu Chuan was not an easy person to deal with.

Just as Qiao Nian was hesitating, Gu Zhou grabbed her arm.

“Nian Nian…”

This low and hoarse voice was a little childish. His voice was long and extremely gentle. His longing eyes were also filled with a hint of coquettishness and begging.

Qiao Nian was instantly defeated.

She had no resistance against Zhou Zhou, who kept acting like a spoiled child.

Qiao Nian smiled at Zhou Zhou and nodded. “Okay.”

When Zhou Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, a bright smile appeared on his face. He was overjoyed. “Nian Nian is the best. Thank you, Nian Nian!”

Qiao Nian smiled and shook her head.

She felt that if it were anyone else, no one would be able to resist Zhou Zhou’s cuteness.

Zhou Zhou was like a tormenting fairy.
