Chapter 1728 - 1728 Happiness

A gentle smile appeared on Gu Zhou’s face, dispelling the coldness on his face. He nodded slightly. “Yes.”

Qiao Nian had already walked over to Gu Zhou. She reached out and took his arm, pulling him to sit down beside Grandpa Qin. With a happy expression, she said, “Grandpa, he’s my husband, Gu Zhou. Isn’t he very handsome?”

Old Master Qin looked at the light in Qiao Nian’s eyes. Although Nian Nian had given birth to three children early and was now the mother of the children, she still looked like a young lady and was very adorable.

Gu Zhou said politely, “Hello, Grandpa. I’m Gu Zhou.”

Old Master Qin only glanced at Gu Zhou and nodded. “Yes, Nian Nian has always had good taste.”

Gu Zhou noticed Old Master Qin’s gaze. Seeing that Old Master Qin’s attention was on Qiao Nian, he knew that Old Master Qin doted on Qiao Nian a lot.

“Of course.” The smile on Qiao Nian’s face grew brighter, as if she was a completely different preson from before. Seh continued. “Grandpa, you don’t know this, but he and I were fated. At that time…”

Old Master Qin sat there with a smile, listening to Qiao Nian talk about the past.

Actually, Chang Feng had already told him about these things, but he still wanted to hear it from Qiao Nian.

In a daze, he seemed to have returned to when Qiao Nian was young. She had been bullied badly by Qin Chuan and had come to him with tears in her eyes to seek justice.

At that time, little Qiao Nian would always pout and complain childishly, “Can you monitor your biological grandson? He’s being mischievous again. He’s even pulling my hair. It hurts, it hurts!”

At that time, Little Qiao Nian was afraid that he wouldn’t understand. She even pulled her own hair to show him. She looked extremely adorable.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

At this moment, the three men in the room were all looking at Qiao Nian gently and dotingly, as if Qiao Nian was their most precious treasure. No matter what Qiao Nian wanted, they would definitely satisfy her.

Ever since Old Master Qin disappeared, Qiao Nian had rarely been happy. She was really happy at this moment.

Her clear voice resounded throughout the room. After talking for a while, she was a little thirsty. Just as she was about to drink some water, Gu Zhou observantly handed a cup of tea to Qiao Nian.

Old Master Qin glanced at Gu Zhou, who was beside Qiao Nian. In a steady voice, he asked, “Has your body been cured?”

Back then, Gu Yue had invited him out of the mountain to treat his illness.

Gu Zhou has a bright smile. He nodded and said, “Thank you for your concern, grandpa. Under Nian Nian’s care, I’ve already recovered. Don’t worry, I will definitely take care of her and the children.”

Back then, Gu Yue had invited him out of the mountain to treat his illness.

Gu Zhou was very sharp. He could acutally read between the lines.

Through Nian Nian’s words, he knew that Gu Zhou had treated her very well in the past. Now that Gu Zhou had promised to treat Nian Nian well in the future, he was relieved.

In Europe.

Although it was late at night in Mark’s ancient manor, the lights in the individual ancient castles were still on.

At this moment, Lina, who had already taken off her sleeping clothes, was standing there in despair. Her beautiful eyes had already lost their light. At this moment, she was standing calmly like an exquisite puppet doll.

The guards standing at the door of the room stared unblinkingly at Lina’s body, drooling.

Lina could sense the guards staring at her. She had never encountered such hardship in her life before. It was as if a large mountain was pressing down on her body.

Lina reached out her left shoulder strap.

Wright stood beside Lina and could see Lina’s jade-like shoulders. He thought of the women he had been with before and how none of them could compare to Lina.

She wasn’t a princess for nothing.

It was worth it if he could play with a princess.

Not far away, the guards widened their eyes, afraid that they would miss out on this mesmerizing scene.

At this moment, the window at the side opened, and a cold wind blew in. The curtains swayed slightly, and right on the heels of that, a silk sheet covered Lina’s body.
