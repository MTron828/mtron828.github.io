chapter 75: Blind Date

Translator: Atlas Studios | Editor: Atlas Studios

These are all potential partners for blind dates!” Matriarch Gu looked at Zhao

Qjan with a smile and saw that Zhao Qjan had her head lowered. Thinking Zhao

Qjan was just shy, she quickly explained. “All grown men should find a wife,

and all grown women should find a husband. You’re not young anymore. It’s

about time for a blind date.”

Grandma.” Zhao Qjan placed the photograph on the coffee table beside her.

Leaning against Matriarch Gu affectionately, she said while blushing, “I want

to stay by your side, always.”

“How can that be?” How could Matriarch Gu not be aware of Zhao Qjan’s little

plans? However, it wasn’t up to her to expose that matter. “All girls have to get

married eventually.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Zhao Qjan smiled helplessly. “Grandma, Im still young. I want to finish my

studies first

“Oh, you. Regardless of whether you’ll get married, you should find a boyfriend

first” Matriarch Gu glanced at the photograph on the coffee table and

continued,”You can also find a boyfriend from school. Bring him home for

Grandma to take a look, and I’ll examine him to make sure he’s up to standard!

Zhao Qian felt even more helpless.

“I raised you single – handedly. Tm going to organize your marriage myself!

Zhao Qjan was suddenly touched. She stared intently at Matriarch Gu and

spoke softly. “Grandma.

“Are there any boys you like in school? Matriarch Gu asked seriously.

Zhao Qjan shook her head shyly.

What about this? I think the eldest young master of the Li family isn’t a bad

choice. Would you like to meet him at Sunset Cafe tomorrow? Matriarch Gu

said, picking up the photograph on the coffee table and handing it to Zhao

Qjan

Zhao Qjan glanced at Matriarch Gu and took the photograph hesitantly. She

looked at the photograph. This man was not bad-looking either. If she recalled

correctly, Matriarch Gu was referring to Li Kun.

Li Kun was one of the most distinguished gentlemen here. If she continued to

decline, she would seem like an ungrateful wretch.

Zhao Qjan pursed her lips. Smiling, she nodded.

“Alright, it’s settled. Go back to your room and sleep!” Matriarch Gu gave a

satisfied smile.

“Okay.

As Zhao Qjan spoke, she stood up and walked towards the door. On the way

back to her room, she kept thinking about how to ruin the blind date.

The next morning.

Elegant music began to play in the room.

Qjao Nian was still half asleep. She groped blindly around her pillow, but still

didn’t manage to grab her phone. In the end, she gave up and got out of bed.

Seeing that her phone was on the bedside table, she grabbed it and put it beside

her ear.

“Hello?

“Nian Nian, something has happened. Come and help me!”

“What is it? Qiao Nian was still not fully conscious.

“Help me go on a blind date!” Su Xiao’s anxious voice rang through the phone

“Aren’t you a fim disbeliever of marriage?” As Qjao Nian spoke, she glanced

around. This was her room. Why couldn’t she remember when she had

returned?

Su Xiao said helplessly, “It’s my mother, of course. She’s insisting that I go on a

blind date. Can you go as my replacement? Oh right, it’s at Sunset Cafe at ten

o’clock!

Qjao Nian hung up and saw Su Xiao’s text. She tidied up briefly and left.

Qjao Nian appeared at Sunset Cafe with a bouquet of tulips in her hands. From

afar, she saw a man witha tulip on his table, and hurriedly walked towards

him.

Tm sorry, Tm sorry. Tm really sorry for being late.” Qjao Nian looked

apologetic as she swiftly took a seat opposite the man.

Li Kun was reading a contract on his phone when he heard her gentle voice. He

looked up and saw a fair-skinned beauty sitting opposite him.

“It’s okay, Miss Zhao. Please have a seat.” Li Kun smiled at Qjao Nian. “T arrived

early.”

Miss Zhao?

What was going on?

However, when Qjao Nian saw the token they had agreed on, the tulip, she

pushed that surprise to the back of her mind. “Thank you.”

As the two of them chatted, Li Kun looked at Qjao Nian, his eyes full of

friendliness. He asked, “What do you do in your free time?
