780 Discovering the Truth

Unexpectedly, Brother Xiao Qi had also learned middle school mathematics.

Gu Zhou sat there calmly, staring unblinkingly at Gu Qi. His eyes narrowed slightly.

Xiao Shi handed the paper to Gu Zhou and asked expectantly, “Daddy, did I do the right thing?”

Gu Zhou did not speak. He just looked at him quietly.

!!

A trace of confusion flashed in Xiao Qing’s eyes. Puzzled, she asked, “Daddy, did I do something wrong?”

“Actually, you know all of this, right?” Gu Zhou said calmly.

Xiao Shi blinked innocently and shook her head. “Daddy, of course I don’t know how to do these questions. These questions are so difficult. I know how to do them because you taught me!”

Gu Zhou sat there and looked at him calmly, hoping that he would admit it himself.

Xiao Shi felt a little uncomfortable under Gu Zhou’s gaze. A bright smile appeared on her face as she said, “Daddy, are you trying to say that I’m very smart?”

“I think you already know these questions!” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Daddy, actually, I only know a little. Most of the time, I don’t know how to do it!” Xiao Shi said humbly with a bright smile on his face.

Gu Zhou was still staring at him.

For some reason, he felt that Gu Qi was a little strange today.

Gu Qi had never smiled at him like this in the past.

Although his face was identical to Gu Qi’s, his personality was completely different.

Could it be that Gu Qi had been by Qiao Nian’s side for too long, so his mentality and personality had already changed?

The current Gu Qi did not have autism at all.

Xiao Shi felt a little uncomfortable under Gu Zhou’s gaze. She couldn’t help but grip the pen in her hand tightly, feeling uneasy.

Her father’s gaze was truly terrifying.

Had Daddy already realized that she wasn’t Brother Xiao Qi?

She acted so smart in front of her father. Perhaps he had already seen through her.

Xiao Shi was very hesitant now. If her father asked her who she was later, how should she answer?

Xiao Shi pointed at the question on the draft paper and asked, “Daddy, don’t you know how to answer this question?”

Yes, Gu Zhou glanced at Xiao Shi’s solution. He was now completely certain that Gu Qi was lying to him.

The first question was much simpler than the second.

If Gu Qi could solve the first question simply, it meant that Gu Qi had really just learned how to understand the questions from him.

However, the second question was so complicated and the steps to solve it were very troublesome. Gu Qi understood after reading it once.

Mathematics had to be studied step by step. It was impossible for him to know a difficult question and not know a simple question.

“Do you know what it means to hide something?” Gu Zhou’s voice was low, and his expression was serious.

The smile on Xiao Shi’s face instantly disappeared.

She had lived in Hai Cheng for a long time and was very good at reading people’s expressions. She suspected that her father was angry.

She knew what it meant to hide something.

But she couldn’t say it now. She had to pretend she didn’t know anything.

Hence, Xiao Shi hurriedly shook his head.

Gu Zhou’s gaze landed on Gu Qi’s face. Meeting Gu Qi’s sincere gaze, he instantly understood.

Gu Qi probably wanted him to accompany him all the time, so he found an excuse to let him tutor his homework.

All these years, he had always left Gu Qi alone at the Dongjiang villa. Even if he was brought over now, he rarely communicated with Gu Qi.

Indeed, he rarely accompanied Gu Qi.

No matter how smart Gu Qi was, he was still a five-year-old child who could be doted on by his parents.

With this thought in mind, Gu Zhou reached out and pulled Gu Qi into his arms.

Xiao Shi was just thinking of an excuse when her father suddenly hugged her. She was so excited that her heart was beating wildly.

Oh my god, her father had actually hugged her.

Her father’s embrace was too gentle and warm. She was so happy!

She had never dared to imagine how it would feel to be in her father’s arms.

Gu Zhou looked down at the little girl in his arms and realized that her body was tense, as if she was a little afraid.

It must be because he had not interacted with Gu Qi for a long time that Gu Qi was afraid.

Fortunately, Qiao Nian had been accompanying Gu Qi, so he gradually recovered.
