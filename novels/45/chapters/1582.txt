Chapter 1583 Pointers

"You've gone too far!" Annie shouted crazily. Just as she was about to get up and snatch the illusion incense back, Qiao Nian had already taken a few steps back. She couldn't touch Qiao Nian at all.

Annie's eyes burned with rage. She looked at Qiao Nian with a dark expression. She swore that she would definitely make Gu Zhou her subordinate in the future. Then, she would let Gu Zhou kill Qiao Nian with his own hands.

When that happened, she really wanted to see Qiao Nian's expression.

The anger in Annie's eyes gradually disappeared. She slowly closed her eyes and looked at Qiao Nian calmly. She asked, "Did you come today to tell me the court date?"

Seeing that Qiao Nian was silent, she put on an understanding smile and said, "Since I've already promised you, I'll definitely do it. Don't worry, I'll definitely identify the mastermind in court."

Qiao Nian gave Annie a meaningful look, then left with Chen Qing.

Annie would never identify Mark obediently in court. She would probably have to make many preparations and wait until she was completely confident before the court session.

After Qiao Nian and Chen Qing came out, Qiao Nian led Chen Qing towards their courtyard. She looked at Chen Qing and asked, "All the people Cui Qi brought to Cliff Mountain have been arrested. Did anyone save Cui Qi?"

"There are many people outside asking about Cui Qi's whereabouts." Chen Qing paused for a moment and continued, "The Cui family has also sent someone over. They even questioned the president during the meeting."

When Qiao Nian heard Chen Qing's words, a trace of a cold smile flashed in her eyes. "Looks like Cui Qi is quite important to them."

She paused for a moment and continued, "Perhaps those people think that we don't have any concrete evidence of Cui Qi committing crime, so they want to get him out."

Chen Qing lowered his head slightly and asked, "Madam, what should we do next?" Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

"Did Cui Qi say anything?" Qiao Nian asked.

"Cui Qi is tight lipped." Chen Qing felt a headache coming on. He frowned. He interrogated Cui Qi last night, but Cui Qi said nothing. "Second Young Master didn't get anything out of him either."

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She didn't expect Gu Zhou's snake to not be effective. She smiled gently. "How many subordinates did Cui Qi originally have?"

"I heard that there are 20,000 of them. The remaining people are always on the move. We've already reached their headquarters," Chen Qing said.

"In that case, let's follow the clues. I think they must still be looking forward to getting the news Amon gave them," Qiao Nian said with a smile.

Chen Qing quickly understood what Qiao Nian was planning to do and hurriedly agreed.

After the two of them returned, Qiao Nian saw Chen Qing take out his computer and start working in the living room.

Ever since they arrived in Europe, Chen Qing had been so busy that his feet had not touched the ground. After being poisoned by the snake, he did not have time to rest well.

She didn't want Chen Qing to be tense. Holding a cup of water, she sat down opposite him and asked with interest, "Chen Qing, have you been in a relationship before?"

Chen Qing stopped typing on his keyboard and looked up at Qiao Nian. His mind had yet to recover from the incident with Cui Qi and Annie.

Qiao Nian took a sip of water and said seriously, "I think the Seventh Princess has been paying attention to you."

When Chen Qing heard Qiao Nian's question, he lowered his gaze slightly. "Madam, the Seventh Princess didn't…"

"Some things still have to be felt with your heart. Lina is a relatively straightforward girl. All her thoughts are written on her face. She cares a lot about you."

Qiao Nian recalled how Lina had secretly looked at Chen Qing. It was obvious that she was a young girl in love. She looked at Chen Qing. "I think no matter what it is, we have to make things clear. We shouldn't keep the other party waiting."

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze slightly. If the two of them could be honest with each other, they wouldn't waste so much time for nothing.

"A person will only live for a few decades. Ignore everything in the outside world. Face your heart directly and speak frankly to the people around you." Qiao Nian looked up at Chen Qing, her lips curving up slightly.

"If I had known that I wasn't a child of the Qiao family back then, I would have gone to look for my biological parents long ago. I wouldn't have wasted so many years."

Qiao Nian couldn't help but add, "Whether it's kinship or love, don't care about what others think. You also don't have to care about distance and status. As long as you have no regrets in this life, you won't sigh endlessly when you grow old."
