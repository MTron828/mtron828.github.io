1267 I Don’t Know How to Play

Xiao Bao immediately covered his mouth happily. When he realized that it was wrong of him to mock Uncle Chang Feng like this, he pretended to be serious.

“Uncle Feng, do you think Mommy will be unhappy to play games with me because I didn’t play well?”

“Don’t worry, she’s very strong. It’s not a problem for her to fight five people alone!” Chang Feng said with a smile.

Xiao Bao’s eyes were filled with stars, and he looked at her with admiration. “Mommy is really amazing.”

“She used to be second in the national server. She didn’t seem to play much after that. Now, she’s dropped to top 20.” Chang Feng told Xiao Bao all the information he had found.

Xiao Bao took Chang Feng’s arm and asked coquettishly, “Uncle Feng, when I’m done playing, can I acknowledge Mommy?”

“It depends, but if you want to acknowledge your mommy, you have to tell me. I’ll see if the time is right.” As Chang Feng spoke, his expression gradually turned serious. “Don’t worry, it won’t be long before you acknowledge your mommy!”

Although Xiao Bao was a little depressed at first, when he heard Chang Feng’s words, he immediately became happy.

“Uncle Feng, why don’t you play with Mommy? In the future, I’ll secretly practice my skills. I won’t drag Mommy down.” Xiao Bao still felt that he didn’t play well. It was better to let Uncle Chang Feng be the substitute first.

When Chang Feng heard Xiao Bao’s words, he shook his head. “I don’t know how to play.”

Xiao Bao looked at Chang Feng in shock, then blinked in confusion.

This?

Uncle Feng actually didn’t know how to play games?

He had always felt that Uncle Feng was omnipotent.

Now, it seemed that Mommy was the most powerful!

Forget it. He should play games with Mommy. Although he was very lousy, he was at least a little better than Uncle Feng.

Chang Feng watched as Xiao Bao, who had been so nervous that his hands were trembling, calm down. His lips curved up slightly, and a smile flashed in his eyes.

It seemed that Xiao Bao was no longer nervous.

While Qiao Nian was talking to Gu Zhou, Chang Feng’s code was sent over. When she saw the contents, she was stunned.

Behind such a cute ID was actually a 1.9-meter-tall man, her eldest senior brother!

She remembered that Eldest Senior Brother had always been cold. She didn’t expect him to act cute online!

After she logged in, she began to search for Eldest Senior Brother’s ID and clicked “Add Friend”.

Eldest Senior Brother quickly agreed to her friend request. She looked at Eldest Senior Brother’s new account. The difference in their ranks was too great. They could only play match mode, not ranking mode.

She turned on the match mode and invited “Baby Xiao Bao” into her room.

Qiao Nian was about to play games with Eldest Senior Brother when a friend came online on the right side of her phone.

First place in the national server!

Mr. Q!

She had played a game with Mr. Q once in the past. At that time, Mr. Q seemed to have started playing because he was short of money.

Qiao Nian thought that Mr. Q had always been interested in playing ranking mode, so she gave up on the idea of playing games with him.

…

Gu Qi and Xiao Shi entered the game. When Gu Qi saw that the account he had been thinking about was online, he was slightly stunned. After some thought, he clicked “Request to enter the room”.

When Gu Qi saw that there was an outsider in the room, he hesitated and typed a series of words.

“Can I invite a good friend?”

…

Qiao Nian looked at the text Mr. Q had sent and smiled. She hurriedly replied, “Of course.”

She initially planned to start the game, but she didn’t expect Mr. Q to take the initiative to apply to enter the room.

Soon, an account with the ID “Shi Shi” entered.

Seeing that everyone was here, Qiao Nian clicked “Begin the game”.

…

When Xiao Shi saw the name of her teammate, her expression froze for a moment. She looked at Gu Qi beside her. “Brother, that person is actually here too.”

Gu Qi also saw the account called “Baby Xiao Bao”. He frowned.

Xiao Shi asked hesitantly, “Brother, why are you playing games with her? Does Brother know her?”

Gu Qi nodded and said, “Yes.”

“Who is she?”

“She used to be second in the national server. She played games well and was a good person. Previously, when I owed Mommy money, I wanted to play games to earn money. She was the one who helped me repay the huge sum I owed!”
