Chapter 394: Ingrate

Hearing Old Madam Gu’s words, Qiao Nian shook her head gently and said, “This isn’t your fault!”

When Jiang Yue saw this, her eyes were filled with jealousy. She asked angrily, “Did I say something wrong?”

When Old Madam Gu heard Jiang Yue’s words, she was so angry that she laughed. She asked, “Is that why you want to kill me and ruin Nian Nian’s innocence?”

When Jiang Yue heard Matriarch Gu say this, she frowned in disbelief. It was clearly Qiao Nian who had snatched everything from her, so she had no choice but to ruin Qiao Nian.

Jiang Yue felt that Old Madam Gu had already been brainwashed by Qiao Nian. She took a deep breath and tried her best to remain calm. She said, “Grandma, when I first came to the Gu family, do you remember what you said? You said that you would take care of me for the rest of my life, and that you would give me some of your assets in the future. But after Qiao Nian came, you forgot your previous promise. You gave all your assets to Qiao Nian!”

At this point, Jiang Yue felt terrible. She complained unhappily, “I originally thought that some of these assets would belong to me and Zhao Qian, but I never expected that the two of us wouldn’t have any at all. You would give them all to Qiao Nian. Do you still have me in your heart?”

She walked forward and looked at Old Madam Gu with disappointment. “Previously, you were willing to adopt me. I’m very grateful to you. That’s why I’ve always worked hard to learn, hoping to reach the standards you like and be able to repay you for raising me in the future. But now, you’ve given everything I cherish and care about to Qiao Nian, leaving nothing for me!”

When Old Madam Gu heard Jiang Yue’s words, her face turned pale with anger.

“Grandma, I’ve never thought about the things you didn’t promise me. But why did you take away what you promised me? We’ve been together for so many years. I never expected that as soon as Qiao Nian came to the Gu family, she would replace me and Zhao Qian.” The more Jiang Yue spoke, the more upset she felt. Tears fell uncontrollably.

Old Madam Gu trembled all over when she heard this. At this moment, she was filled with regret. She shouldn’t have brought Jiang Yue back, nor should she have raised her. She was simply raising a tiger to cause trouble!

When the butler heard Jiang Yue’s words, his expression instantly darkened. He turned around and walked elsewhere. After a while, he returned with a document. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, Jiang Yue was still complaining unhappily. “Grandma also knew that the speech at school was very important to me. You had always been the one to prepare the gown for me, but that day, you asked me to take it off!”

When Qiao Nian heard Jiang Yue’s words, her face instantly darkened. She retorted angrily, “I finally understand now. Jiang Yue, you’re saying that others have to keep doing something for you until they die, right?”

......

“If someone doesn’t give in to you once, it means that they don’t love you or dote on you anymore. Then, you can ignore all the efforts that others have made in the past. I want to ask, what have you done for Grandma all these years?”

“Shut up. You have no right to speak here. If it weren’t for you, my relationship with Grandma would never have changed. Grandma will always be my dearest grandmother, and I will take good care of her!” Jiang Yue said angrily.

Old Madam Gu’s heart ached when she saw Jiang Yue like this. She had never expected that the granddaughter she had personally raised would be so dissatisfied with her.

Seeing that Old Madam Gu was silent, Jiang Yue asked, “Grandma, why haven’t you said anything? You…”

The butler couldn’t stand it anymore and interrupted Jiang Yue mercilessly. “Shut up!”
