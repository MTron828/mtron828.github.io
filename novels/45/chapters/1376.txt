1377 Saving Herself

“Director Li, can we film someone else’s scenes this afternoon and tomorrow first? I’ll make up for my losses for the past two days.” Song Yu looked up at Director Li, her voice filled with tears.

Seeing that Song Yu didn’t look well, Director Li asked worriedly, “What happened?”

“My sister has gone missing. I want to go home and take a look.” Song Yu was not a fool. Many people were staring at Lu Qi, so she could not say her name directly.

When Director Li heard this, he hurriedly comforted Song Yu and asked her to go home to take a look.

Song Yu returned to the nanny van and asked her assistant to drive to the Wang Village Tunnel.

Lu Qi carefully observed her surroundings and climbed up the low ruins. She wanted to see if there was a path ahead, but when she saw a light not far away, her eyes lit up.

She turned around and said happily to Qin Chuan, who was sitting not far away, “Senior Brother, I’ve found the way. We can leave from here!”

As Lu Qi spoke, she carefully got down from the ruins. When her feet touched the ground, she ran towards Qin Chuan. She squatted down and looked up at Qin Chuan, who was holding his chest. “Senior, we can go out now.”

Under the weak light of the cell phone, Lu Qi saw Qin Chuan’s sickly pale face. She pursed her lips and pretended to be happy. “I’ll help you out!”

Qin Chuan looked at Lu Qi’s smiling face and wanted to respond with a smile. Suddenly, he felt a pain in his chest. He panted heavily. When the pain gradually disappeared, he said to Lu Qi, “Okay.”

Lu Qi held Qin Chuan’s arm. From the corner of her eye, she kept sneaking glances at him, worried that he wouldn’t be able to hold on.

With every step Qin Chuan took, his chest hurt terribly. His eyelids grew heavier and heavier, and he could close them at any moment and never open them again.

A faint fragrance wafted from the tip of his nose. This fragrance was Lu Qi’s fragrance. Supporting himself, he followed Lu Qi towards the ruins.

Gritting his teeth, Qin Chuan climbed up the ruins bit by bit with Lu Qi’s help. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Lu Qi brought Qin Chuan to the top of the ruins. There was a hole about twenty meters ahead. As long as they crawled out, they could leave this place.

However, if he wanted to walk to the exit hole, he still had to climb a 1.5-meter-tall stone.

Lu Qi looked at Qin Chuan and said, “Senior Brother, climb first. I’ll support you. When the time comes, I’ll be able to climb up myself.”

Hearing Lu Qi’s suggestion and looking at her thin body, Qin Chuan frowned imperceptibly and said in a low voice, “I’ll help you up.”

Lu Qi looked up at Qin Chuan and was about to speak when she saw Qin Chuan covering his lips and coughing. She frowned and said worriedly, “Senior Brother, don’t think that I’m thin. Actually, I’m very strong! Hurry up and climb!”

In the past, Qin Chuan could easily jump to a height of 1.5 meters. However, his body was very weak now. He did not dare to exert any strength at all, let alone make any large movements.

He was already sweating profusely from such a simple task like climbing the ruins.

“Senior, I can climb up this height myself. Go up first,” Lu Qi said firmly.

Qin Chuan could only agree. He gently raised a leg and placed it on the stage.

“Senior, go up quickly. I’ll support you.” As Lu Qi spoke, she supported Qin Chuan’s body forcefully.

After Qin Chuan climbed up, Lu Qi heaved a sigh of relief and followed closely.

After Lu Qi climbed up, she helped Qin Chuan towards the hole. She looked up at the hole above her. This hole looked to be three meters tall. It would be a little difficult to climb up.

It seemed that she could only step on the stones below and climb up. With this thought in mind, Lu Qi was about to move the stones when she was stopped by Qin Chuan.

“Don’t move!”

Lu Qi looked at Qin Chuan in confusion.

Qin Chuan clutched his chest with one hand, suppressing his coughing. Only then did he say, “These stones are still unstable. Come here, don’t move. If they collapse, they’ll hit you.”

“Ahem.”

After Qin Chuan finished speaking, he coughed up a mouthful of blood, leaving only a metallic taste in his mouth.

Seeing Qin Chuan like this, Lu Qi’s face suddenly turned pale.
