1197 Ah!

When the raw stone was cut open, Mr. Wang instantly became excited. He said happily, “It’s a treasure. I’m going to earn it this time!”

Thank you readers!

The people around them looked at the raw stone with envy.

“This stone is worth at least ten million!”

“Mr. Wang is so lucky to have earned seven million yuan!”

Old Master Shi handed the stone to Mr. Wang. Mr. Wang looked at the stone in his hand happily.

“Congratulations, Mr. Wang!” Old Master Cheng Shi said happily. This was a good start. “This is a good start.”

“Congratulations!”

“He made a killing!”

“Mr. Wang is very lucky today!”

Mr. Wang smiled and thanked others.

While everyone was cheering, the banquet hall was bustling with activity.

At this moment, a scream broke the commotion.

“Ah!”

Everyone looked over and saw the woman in the burgundy gown covering her butt with a terrified expression.

Qiao Nian frowned. That woman was none other than Jiang Yue, whom they had just met.

Jiang Yue said shyly, “You’ve gone too far. Why did you touch me?”

Standing beside Jiang Yue was a man in his fifties. He had a full beard and swayed as if he had drunk too much. “Isn’t your butt exposed for others to touch? Why did I say something wrong?”

Qiao Nian frowned slightly. She knew this man. He was the local tyrant of the eastern region, Ye Sen.

She had heard of Ye Sen’s name before. Logically speaking, everyone would respect a famous person like Ye Sen.

However, Ye Sen was really too lecherous. He had a hobby, and that was to sleep with married women.

As the saying went, a friend’s wife could not be targeted. Ye Sen did not care about this at all. He felt that his friend’s wife was better and had ruined the families of three friends.

Jiang Yue was standing close to Ye Sen. Today, Jiang Yue was like a thorny rose, attracting everyone’s desires. Ye Sen stood beside Jiang Yue, so of course he couldn’t help but touch her!

Moreover, weren’t toys meant to be played with?

If he took a liking to Boss Jin’s plaything, Boss Jin should respectfully send it over!

Jiang Yue frowned at Ye Sen. She had been in the Gu family for so many years and had a good eye for people. Ye Sen was definitely a frivolous person. She had always hated such people. She was so angry that her face turned red.

Just as Jiang Yue was about to speak, Boss Jin pulled her behind him, as if he wanted to stand up for her. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

No one would be so naive as to think that Boss Jin was trying to stand up for Jiang Yue. Boss Jin had even touched Jiang Yue’s butt in the beginning, which meant that he treated Jiang Yue as a plaything.

How could a plaything be worth anything in comparison to benefits?

Boss Jin walked up to Ye Sen with a smile. “Mr. Ye Sen, are you done playing with the six models I gave you previously?”

Ye Sen stared straight at Jiang Yue, almost drooling. When he heard Boss Jin’s words, he reluctantly looked at his face.

“Boss Jin, how can those trinkets from before be compared to this stunner beside you? Isn’t this an insult to this stunner!” As Ye Sen spoke, he swallowed. “If I can spend the night with her, I’ll really die under a peony flower. Even if I become a ghost, I’ll be a Casanova!”

The smile on Boss Jin’s face did not diminish. He asked, “Is that so?”

“Of course!” Ye Sen had never known what it meant to be polite. His gaze was fixed on Jiang Yue’s face. Thinking that Boss Jin was going to give this woman to him, he said magnanimously, “Boss Jin, we discussed the batch of goods previously. I can give you 10%!”

“Mr. Ye Sen is indeed magnanimous.” When Boss Jin heard Ye Sen’s words, the smile on his face grew brighter. He turned to look at Jiang Yue and asked, “Yue’er, are you willing to be with Mr. Ye Sen?”

Qiao Nian looked at Jiang Yue, feeling very uncomfortable.
