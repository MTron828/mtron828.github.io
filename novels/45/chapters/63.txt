Chapter 64: Changing Sides

“Someone else was responsible for burning down the school building. If it weren’t for Principal Qiao’s funding of the reconstruction, An University wouldn’t be what it is now.” When Wang An said this, he looked at Qiao Nian gratefully. “Principal Qiao, thank you!”

At this moment, everyone was stunned. They must have been hallucinating. Otherwise, how could they have heard such fantastical words?

“That’s impossible. Qiao Nian was still young back then. How could she have been able to get so many awards?” Shen Xing exclaimed.

Qiao Xin, too, was thinking that there was something wrong with what the principal said. Now she finally understood where the problem lay. She nodded in agreement. “Principal, there’s something wrong with my sister’s brain. How can she be so capable?”

“Don’t you know Weibo?” Wang An frowned, his entire face darkening. “Take a careful look. The names of the people who won those awards are all on the Internet.”

Wang An’s casual words stunned everyone.

One had to know that in the hearts of everyone in An University, Wang An was a god. Wang An was their last hope of saving An University. They had never thought of Qiao Nian.

Shen Xing could not believe her ears. If she were to be expelled from the university, it would truly be too humiliating. She couldn’t help but say, “Aren’t you the principal of our school?”

When Wang An heard this, he couldn’t help but frown. “I’ve been telling everyone for a long time that I’m the vice-principal!”

Only then did everyone recall what Wang An had said in the past.

That was true.

Wang An had always said that he was the vice-principal, but in everyone’s eyes, Wang An was the principal himself.

No one could accept that Qiao Nian, a student who had almost ruined the school, was actually the principal who had saved the school.

This realization was unacceptable to everyone.

“By the way, during the graduation banquet, I told everyone that I would introduce the principal to all of you.” When Wang An thought about how the surprise he had prepared for Qiao Nian had been ruined by Shen Xing and the others, he felt a little uncomfortable. He felt that Qiao Nian had suffered.

Qiao Xin felt a little suffocated. She looked at Qiao Nian. All these years, she had been arrogantly trampling on Qiao Nian, forcing her to be admitted to the mental hospital. She never expected Qiao Nian to be standing on top of her instead.

How could a wild lass from the countryside surpass her?

Qiao Xin’s eyes were filled with rage as she looked at Qiao Nian, but she quickly lowered her gaze, pretending not to be ignorant and innocent.

Soon, the onlookers began to stand on Qiao Nian’s side.

“Whenever I saw Qiao Nian in the past, I felt that she was very approachable. I didn’t expect her to be a top student, much less the principal of our school.”

“It’s our school’s honor to have her as our principal.”

“What a joke. Su Yan even said that the principal let Qiao Nian enter the school on account of him. The funniest thing is that Qiao Xin, Qiao Nian’s younger sister, doesn’t even know that her older sister is so outstanding.”

“By the way, do you think Qiao Xin chased Qiao Nian away back then because of Su Yan?” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“It’s possible. I heard from others that Qiao Xin is easily jealous. She’s a very hypocritical person!”

“Oh my god, Qiao Nian is a big shot. I want to get close to her!”

…

Qiao Xin and Su Yan heard every word of the conversation around them.

Su Yan felt as if he had been slapped in the face. His face was burning with embarrassment, and he felt as if his entire world had collapsed.

At this moment, Qiao Nian stood up slowly.

The onlookers all looked at Qiao Nian. For a moment, no one dared to speak.

Qiao Nian walked over to Wang An and gave a small smile.

This smile stunned all the students.
