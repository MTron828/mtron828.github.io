Chapter 614: Congenital Autism

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Su Sheng’s expression instantly darkened.

Seeing Su Sheng like this, Qiao Nian became even more anxious. She hurriedly asked, “Doctor Su, what’s Xiao Qi’s condition now? Can you tell me if he’s really pretending to be autistic, or if he really has autism?”

“Pretending to be autistic?” When Su Sheng heard Qiao Nian’s words, she frowned slightly. Then, her eyes lit up, as if she had thought of something. She asked, “Did my senior sister tell you that he was pretending to be autistic?”

Qiao Nian nodded.

Su Sheng frowned even more and said unhappily, “In my senior sister’s eyes, as long as one’s autism hasn’t reached the point of suicide, it’s all fake.”

Hearing Su Sheng’s words, Qiao Nian’s heart began to race.

Could it be that Gu Qi really had autism?

However, she felt that Gu Qing was still very formidable.

Just from her attitude, Gu Qing could tell that she had given birth before.

Deep down, she was still very willing to believe Gu Qing’s diagnosis.

However, Gu Qing did not visit Gu Qi in the end, so she wanted to hear Su Sheng’s diagnosis.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian asked politely, “Doctor Su, are you saying that Little Qi has autism?”

When Su Sheng heard Qiao Nian’s words, she nodded without hesitation and said, “This child should be born with autism. Moreover, all his actions can be completely explained.”

“What? How is that possible?” Qiao Nian’s expression changed drastically. She couldn’t help but raise her voice. Frowning, she looked at Su Sheng in disbelief.

Qiao Nian still remembered her first encounter with Gu Qi.

At that time, Gu Qi spoke normally, and he could even write an IOU for him. He was only three or four years old, but his handwriting was so beautiful. It was even much more neat than other children’.

How could such a smart child be born with autism?

Qiao Nian’s frown deepened. She recalled how Gu Qi had seen Su Sheng just now, and a trace of sadness appeared in her eyes.

Su Sheng’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. She noticed Qiao Nian’s attitude and asked subconsciously, “Miss Qiao, is that child really just your friend’s child?”

Qiao Nian retracted her thoughts and her gaze fell on Su Sheng’s face.

How capable was Su Sheng? She could actually tell that she was nervous, and had the same suspicion as Gu Qing.

Qiao Nian suppressed her thoughts and coughed. She straightened her expression and frowned slightly. She stared unblinkingly at Su Sheng. She asked, “I heard from Doctor Gu that if one suffers from congenital autism, there’s no possibility of recovery, right?”

“From the current research results, that’s indeed the case. Of course, we can’t rule out surprises.” Su Sheng nodded and said slowly. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

When Qiao Nian heard Su Sheng’s words, her heart sank.

However, Gu Qing and Su Sheng had different diagnoses. At this moment, she didn’t know who to listen to.

However, she still hoped that Gu Qing was right. That would mean that Little Qi did not have congenital autism.

Previously, Qiao Nian had heard that children with autism were indifferent to emotions and were unwilling to communicate with others. Moreover, this kind of child’s language development would become slower and slower. They wouldn’t have any hobbies.

If Little Qi really had congenital autism, then he would gradually fall out of touch with this society in the future. Would he still have the ability to survive in the future?

Su Sheng could tell that Qiao Nian was worried. She comforted her, “You don’t have to worry too much. Whether it’s innate or acquired autism, as long as we work hard through external means, the child’s condition will definitely improve. Perhaps he will recover completely in the future.”

When Qiao Nian heard Su Sheng’s words, she smiled. She knew that Su Sheng was comforting her, but her mind was still in a mess.

“Doctor Su, I have something to ask you,” Qiao Nian said politely.

“What question?”

“I’m just curious. How did you confirm that Little Qi has congenital autism just now?”
