1541 Compromise

Aisha was so angry that she was panting heavily, her chest heaving. She glared fiercely at Lina, looking as if she wanted to eat her alive. She asked, “Are you sure you won’t tell Wright?”

Lina smiled and nodded. “Aisha, you’re my good sister. We all have the same grandparents. I’m close to you. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have remained silent after getting the video.”

“Alright, pretend I didn’t come today!” Aisha tried hard to suppress the anger in her chest. Her gaze landed on Lina’s face and she warned solemnly, “If I find out that the video has been leaked, I’ll never let you off!”

Lina smiled and nodded. “Don’t worry, I won’t spread the video.”

With Lina’s assurance, Aisha turned around and walked towards her car. Her mind was in a mess, and her mind was filled with thoughts of how to fool Wright and tell him that she had no way to save Annie.

Lina watched as Aisha’s car drove further and further away. The smile on her face gradually disappeared. She narrowed her eyes slightly. Before one wave subsided, another would rise.

When she returned to Shen Mei’s room, she saw Qiao Nian sitting in a pavilion not far away. Gu Zhou and Chen Qing were also there.

Lina glanced at Chen Qing and hurriedly looked away. Lowering her head, she sat down beside Qiao Nian and asked seriously, “Nian Nian, how’s my mother?”

Qiao Nian looked up from the map on the stone table. She smiled at Lina and said, “Don’t worry, Madam is fine.”

Her gaze landed on the map again. The President and the guards had already searched the place she had circled previously. There was no result on their side for the time being.

In her opinion, Cliff Mountain was also the most likely place to have Colorful Fungus. “Let’s go to Cliff Mountain. When the time comes, we’ll split into two teams. We might encounter danger on the way. When the time comes, we have to keep in touch at all times. After we agree on a time, regardless of whether we have gathered Colorful Fungus or not, we have to gather at the place we agreed on just in case.”

Looking at Qiao Nian’s serious face, Lina hurriedly nodded.

Gu Zhou glanced at Lina and gave Chen Qing a look. Chen Qing immediately nodded in agreement.

The four of them walked out. Chen Qing drove, and the four of them sat in the same car.

Cliff Mountain was about an hour away from the palace.

Cliff Mountain was an undeveloped mountain with lush vegetation. If they wanted to climb it, they could only rely on themselves.

Qiao Nian looked at the lush cliff mountain. It was a mountain that had no developments on it. The possibility of colorful fungus being found here was very high.

According to their previous agreement, they split into two teams.

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian were in one team, while Lina and Chen Qing were in another.

The four of them agreed on a time and place to gather. Qiao Nian had even specially prepared special fireworks. After all, the signal on the mountain wasn’t good. If they encountered an emergency on the mountain, they could contact each other urgently through the fireworks.

Qiao Nian placed the fireworks in Lina’s hand. Seeing Lina’s worried expression, she comforted her. “Don’t worry, if we really can’t find it here, we’ll go to Country Z. Country Z has Colorful Fungus.”

Lina nodded slightly. She looked up at the mountain in front of her. Although the mountain was not high, the lush forest gave off an oppressive feeling. Some places were especially steep and looked very dangerous. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Nian Nian was just her mother’s doctor, but she could climb Cliff Mountain and put herself in danger for her mother.

If she were Nian Nian, she would never risk her life for an outsider.

“Nian Nian.” Lina held Qiao Nian’s hand tightly and pursed her lips slightly. She took a deep breath and said, “There must be many dangers on the mountain. Nian Nian, you have to be careful. Just like you said, if we can’t find Colorful Fungus here, we’ll go to Country Z in the future. As long as you’re safe.”

When Qiao Nian heard Lina’s words, she smiled gently and nodded. “Yes, yes. I know. You have to be careful too.”

In the past, Qiao Nian often went into the mountains to play. She gave Lina a few more reminders, then instructed Chen Qing to take good care of Lina. Only then did she walk in the direction she had planned with Gu Zhou.

Lina looked at Qiao Nian’s retreating back, and her eyes couldn’t help but turn red. Nian Nian was really the kindest and most selfless person she had ever seen.

After watching Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian disappear from their sight, Chen Qing’s gaze fell on Lina. His expression was serious. “Seventh Princess, it’s getting late.”
