Chapter 277: How Is This Possible?

Xia Xue couldn’t stand it anymore. She was so frustrated that she couldn’t help but knock on the door again. In her heart, she prayed to God for a response.

Gao Lin looked at Xia Xue worriedly. Seeing that there was still no reaction from the door, her heart jumped to her throat.

Xia Xue exerted some strength and accidentally pushed the door open. It turned out that the door wasn’t locked at all.

The door was empty.

Xia Xue was stunned. She looked at the empty room in disbelief.

A trace of confusion flashed in Xia Xue’s eyes. She opened all the doors to the rooms, but they were still empty. There was no one there.

Everyone looked at the empty room with confusion written all over their faces.

Wang Xuan tried hard to suppress her laughter. She looked up at Xia Xue and asked curiously, “This is so strange. You just said that Mr. Dong Hua is playing the violin in his room. May I know where he is?”

Gao Lin’s mind raced. Her gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face.

Of course, she didn’t believe that a self-taught person could play the violin so beautifully. She stepped forward and questioned Qiao Nian loudly, “Qiao Nian, are you up to no good?”

When the others heard Gao Lin’s words, they were confused. Their gazes lingered on Gao Lin and Qiao Nian.

Seeing that everyone was looking over, Gao Lin said angrily, “Qiao Nian, admit it. Did you play the violin recording of Mr. Dong Hua’s Missing? Did you make us think that Mr. Dong Hua was in the training room? You fooled us. Is there any meaning in doing this?”

Everyone’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face, their eyes filled with confusion.

When Xia Xue heard Gao Lin’s words, she recalled how silly she had looked when she knocked on all the doors just now. She couldn’t help but frown. However, in front of everyone, she still tried hard to suppress her anger. “Student Qiao Nian, everyone is looking forward to meeting Mr. Dong Hua. Your actions have disappointed everyone. Please don’t do this again. Everyone will be sad.”

“Sigh, I thought I would be able to meet Mr. Dong Hua!”

“Exactly, exactly. I didn’t expect it to be just a farce.”

“Let’s go. If you think about it carefully, you should know that Mr. Dong Hua won’t come to our training room. We shouldn’t be daydreaming!”

…

When Qiao Nian heard everyone’s words, she raised her eyebrows slightly. Her eyes were cold as she enunciated each word clearly. “Gao Lin, who told you that I played a recording of Mr. Dong Hua’s music?”

When Gao Lin heard Qiao Nian’s question, she laughed out loud in disdain. She said sarcastically, “You didn’t? Did you bow the strings then? You don’t even blink when you lie. You don’t even know how to write a draft before you brag. Who would believe you?”

The others sized Qiao Nian up curiously. They realized that Qiao Nian was carrying a violin on her back. From the looks of it, she was really here to practice. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

At this moment, everyone began to hesitate. For a moment, they didn’t know if Qiao Nian had played a recording just now, or if Qiao Nian had played Mr. Dong Hua’s tune.

Wang Xuan stood at the side and said, “If you’re talking about the song ‘Missing’, then it should be Qiao Nian who played it. She’s been teaching me to play this song recently.”

Gao Lin recalled how Qiao Nian had explained the score to Wang Xuan in the morning.

Could it really be Qiao Nian who had played it just now?

However, Gao Lin quickly threw this thought to the back of her mind. She refused to believe that Qiao Nian was the one who had played that song. After all, that song just now was exactly the same as Mr. Donghua’s original version.

“Hahaha.” Gao Lin burst out laughing. She turned to look at the onlookers and asked, “Do you believe that the music just now was played by Qiao Nian? I don’t believe it!”

No one said anything. Instead, they looked at Qiao Nian in surprise.

“Can she really play such a beautiful tune?”

“I don’t know. I heard that she’s a new student.”

“Can new students really play such a beautiful tune nowadays? Is it really that sick?”

“She’s carrying a violin on her back. It looks like it’s really her.”

“Do you think she played the music?”

“How is this possible? What’s her motive for doing this?”

When Gao Lin heard this, her eyes lit up. She said, “She heard from Mr. Dong Hua that Sister Xia Xue can play the violin well, so she came over on purpose to attract Brother Cao’s attention and replace Sister Xia Xue as Mr. Dong Hua’s female musician.”
