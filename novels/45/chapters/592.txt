Chapter 593: Concern

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Matriarch Gu had taken care of Gu Qi for a period of time before, so she knew that this child could already eat by himself. Seeing that Qiao Nian was still feeding Gu Qi, she frowned imperceptibly for a moment. Then, her expression relaxed. “Little Qi, you’ve grown up. You should learn to eat by yourself. Your Auntie Qiao Nian only fell asleep at midnight last night. She must be especially hungry now.”

Gu Qi stopped eating for a moment. He recalled that Auntie and Dad had only returned home last night after he had gotten up in the middle of the night. Dad must have arranged too much work for Auntie, which was why she had not rested well.

“Auntie, I’ll eat by myself.” As Gu Qi spoke, he picked up his spoon and scooped a bowl of soup into his mouth.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Qi. This child was so sensible that it made her heart ache.

While Qiao Nian was eating, she didn’t forget to take more food for Gu Qi. Every time she saw Gu Qi’s sparkling eyes, her lips would involuntarily curve up.

After lunch, Qiao Nian took Gu Qi upstairs to rest. After coaxing Gu Qi to sleep, she returned to her room, tidied up briefly, and prepared to leave.

When Qiao Nian went downstairs to the living room, she saw Gu Zhou sitting on the sofa and looking at his phone.

“I’m going out.” When Qiao Nian passed by Gu Zhou, she casually greeted him. When she heard Gu Zhou respond, she looked at him and said, “Grandma isn’t in a good mood. You should spend more time with her.”

Gu Zhou frowned as he looked at his phone. When he heard Qiao Nian’s reminder, he looked up at her with eyes flickering. “Shall I get the chauffeur to send you there?”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She looked at Gu Zhou in surprise and asked, “Why are you so concerned about me today?”

Gu Zhou’s expression was calm as he said, “We don’t keep idle people in the house. The driver should work too.”

Qiao Nian raised her eyebrows slightly. What kind of reason was that?

Gu Zhou didn’t go out much in the past, and most of the time, Chen Qing drove.

However, Gu Zhou looked serious as if he was seriously considering this matter.

Qiao Nian nodded slightly. “Okay.”

Gu Zhou walked upstairs.

Qiao Nian stood rooted to the ground, looking at Gu Zhou’s back as he walked upstairs. Her brow furrowed. Was Gu Zhou worried that something would happen to her alone?

Was Gu Zhou that considerate?

With this thought in mind, the phone in her bag suddenly rang, interrupting Qiao Nian’s thoughts.

Qiao Nian took out her phone, answered the call, and walked out. “Brother Zhu, I understand. Yes, I’ll get ready to leave now.”

Before Gu Zhou reached the corner of the second floor, he heard Qiao Nian’s voice on the phone. He frowned.

“Brother Lu Zhu?”

Lu Zhu?

Was Qiao Nian going to eat with Lu Zhu?

When Gu Zhou turned around, he saw that Qiao Nian had already walked out of the door. His expression changed slightly, and he took out his phone to call Chen Qing.

Chen Qing was frantically searching for information on Gu Chuan, but he failed to find anything. At this moment, he received a call from Gu Zhou and picked up the phone uneasily.

“Where?”

Second Young Master’s cold voice came from the phone.

“Second Young Master, I’m already at the door.” Chen Qing gripped his phone tightly.

“Send Second Young Madam out now.”

Chen Qing trembled a little when he heard Second Young Master’s voice. For some reason, he felt that Second Young Master was in a bad mood today. He nodded uneasily. “Okay.”

“Go and see who she’s meeting.”

“Okay.” Chen Qing had yet to settle Gu Chuan’s matter, and now there was a new mission. He wondered if he could get more year-end bonuses this year.

Qiao Nian walked out and saw a black Bentley parked at the entrance of the villa. Chen Qing was standing at the side.

Seeing that Qiao Nian had arrived, Chen Qing hurriedly opened the door of the backseat. “Second Young Madam, please get in.”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She looked at Chen Qing in surprise. “Are you giving me a ride?” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Didn’t Gu Zhou ask the chauffeur to send her there?
