Shen An swallowed nervously and asked, “What favor?”

Thank you readers!

“It’s like this, Doctor Shen. Before I invited you over, I’ve already searched for information about you. You’re a rare genius doctor. Although you’re a forensic doctor, I know that you’re quite good at bone marrow transplants.” At this point, the woman paused for a moment and continued, “Before you became a forensic doctor, you were also the youngest internal medicine doctor in the world. The reason why you changed careers to become a forensic doctor was because your wife was robbed when she was thirty-two weeks pregnant. Although she was sent to the hospital by passersby, she only managed to protect your daughter in the end!”

Shen An clenched his fists tightly. He would always remember how his wife had looked when she left.

That day, he was supposed to accompany his wife to a prenatal examination, but a patient suddenly arrived at the emergency room, and only he could perform that bone marrow transplant surgery. He could only promise his wife that he would accompany her to a prenatal examination next time.

He had never expected that day to be their farewell.

“Although your daughter survived, she suffered from cerebral palsy because of prolonged lack of oxygen. Actually, I sympathize with you. I think you care a lot about the last bloodline your wife left you! You can understand parents’ love for their daughters, right?”

Shen An didn’t speak. Ever since his wife passed away, he had resigned from the hospital and switched careers to become a forensic doctor. He hated those who committed crimes. He wanted to help the police arrest all those criminals!

As long as there were no criminals in the world, a tragedy like his wife would never happen again!

By the time he arrived at the hospital, his wife was no longer breathing. He hugged his wife on the hospital bed and cried hysterically!

Shen An took a deep breath and frowned. He tried hard to maintain his calm tone. “What exactly do you want me to do?”

“What I asked you to do is a piece of cake for you.” The woman’s voice suddenly turned vicious. “My daughter has leukemia. Her bone marrow is compatible with the eldest daughter of the Lu family, Lu Nian. As long as you perform a bone marrow transplant for my daughter and she can survive, you and your daughter will be safe. Otherwise, all of you will have to die with my daughter!”

When Shen An heard the woman’s words, he frowned and asked in surprise, “The eldest daughter of the Lu family, Lu Nian? She’s only three years old? No, she’s too young. She’s not suitable!”

“My daughter is also three years old. They’re about the same age. She’s very suitable for a bone marrow transplant!” The woman paused for a moment and continued, “My request to you is for my daughter to live. I don’t care about anything else. If you can’t do it, you can go to hell with your daughter now!”

Shen An sat on the spot, so angry that his temples were throbbing. He knew in his heart that if he didn’t perform a bone marrow transplant on this crazy woman’s child, this woman would definitely find other doctors to perform a bone marrow transplant on her daughter!

No wonder she had kidnapped the eldest daughter of the Lu family, Lu Nian. So she was trying to let her daughter live!

“If the bone marrow of an adult matches your daughter’s, my suggestion is to choose the bone marrow of an adult first, because…”

“You don’t have to worry. I’ll let you undergo surgery now!” The woman lowered her head slightly and moved closer to Shen An’s ear, saying softly, “If you’re unwilling, just say so. I won’t force you!”

When Shen An thought of the eldest daughter of the Lu family, Lu Nian, and his daughter, he slowly closed his eyes. After some thought, he said, “I promise you, but I want to see my daughter and Little Lu Nian first.”

“If you want to see your daughter, I’m afraid that won’t be possible. She’s locked up somewhere else by me.” The woman seemed to be very satisfied with Shen An’s answer. She smiled and said, “As long as the surgery goes smoothly, I’ll naturally return your daughter to the Zhao family intact! However, I can let you see Lu Nian of the Lu family later.”

Shen An swallowed and asked nervously, “Are you sure the bone marrow of the eldest daughter of the Lu family matches your daughter’s bone marrow? If it doesn’t, there will be a rejection reaction. At that time, neither of them might survive!”
