Chapter 243: Fake Tickets!

When Qiao Nian heard Ye Ran’s words, she suddenly laughed. With great difficulty, she said sarcastically, “Ye Ran, do you need me to introduce a psychiatrist to you? Let them treat your brain, lest you bite everywhere like a mad dog!”

When Wang Xuan heard Qiao Nian’s words, she couldn’t help but laugh.

Qiao Nian’s mouth was amazing. She wanted to have a mouth like that too.

Gao Lin stood at the side and reminded her softly, “Why don’t I investigate the authenticity of Qiao Nian’s ticket?”

Ye Ran sniffed hard and looked at Qiao Nian with hatred written all over her face. She said approvingly, “Investigate. Check now to see if her ticket is real!”

Gao Lin had investigated Qiao Nian’s background. Qiao Nian was just a pitiful wretch who had been raised in the countryside. How could such a person have a ticket to Mr. Dong Hua’s concert?

Moreover, Gao Lin didn’t want Ye Ran to drop out of school. Ye Ran’s father was very close to Mr. Dong Hua. She still wanted to get the tickets to Mr. Dong Hua’s concert from Ye Ran.

Gao Lin took out her phone and scanned the QR code on Qiao Nian’s ticket. Then, the webpage prompted her to wait.

Suddenly, the webpage jumped to the official website of Mr. Dong Hua’s concert. Qiao Nian’s seat was also displayed.

This meant that Qiao Nian’s ticket was real.

Gao Lin looked at Ye Ran, her face pale. She handed the phone to Ye Ran.

Ye Ran glanced at her phone and her vision darkened. She swayed on the spot.

Seeing this, the other students looked at Gao Lin curiously.

“Gao Lin, is this ticket real?”

“Yes, Gao Lin. Why aren’t you saying anything?”

…

Gao Lin pursed her lips slightly. Although she didn’t want to admit it, Qiao Nian, this country bumpkin, did indeed have tickets to Mr. Dong Hua’s concert. She could only nod and say, “Qiao Nian’s ticket is real.”

Ye Ran swayed on the spot. She looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief. She had never expected Qiao Nian’s votes to be real.

“How is this possible?” Xiao Xiao, Ye Ran’s lackey, shouted.

Ye Ran turned to look at Xiao Xiao. She had an ominous feeling, and her heart began to race.

Xiao Xiao lowered her head and frantically scanned the QR code of Ye Ran’s ticket on her classmate’s phone.

“How did this happen? How did this happen?”

Xiao Xiao muttered softly.

When the people around them saw this, they moved closer to Xiao Xiao and asked in confusion, “What exactly is going on? What are you talking about?”

“Why can’t Ye Ran’s tickets enter the official website?” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“I’ve scanned it three or four times, but I still can’t get in.”

“Is there something wrong with my phone?”

When Gao Lin, who was standing at the side, heard Xiao Xiao’s words, her expression froze. She took out her phone and scanned Ye Ran’s tickets, only to realize that she couldn’t enter the official website at all.

A notification appeared on the page: Please scan the correct QR code for admission!

When Gao Lin saw this, she was stunned. She had never expected Ye Ran’s ticket to be fake.

When Professor Zhang heard the others’ words, his gaze fell on one person’s face and his eyes turned cold. He didn’t expect Ye Ran to cause such a ruckus in the classroom just for a fake ticket.

Gao Lin turned to look at Ye Ran, her eyes filled with coldness. She questioned. “Ye Ran, how can you lie to us like this? You actually took out fake tickets and exchanged one for my Chanel bag. You’re too good at scheming. You’re a liar. Give me back my bag!”

“And my Gucci bag!”

“My Swarovski bracelet!”

…

Ye Ran looked at one of those familiar faces. For a moment, she found them a little unfamiliar. She actually couldn’t recognize them.

How could they look at her with resentment?

She had always thought that they were good friends, but she had never expected them to become like this when they found out that she had a fake ticket.

Qiao Nian didn’t expect Ye Ran’s tickets to be fake either. She said lightly, “These things add up to at least a million yuan. It should be considered a crime. If Student Ye doesn’t return them, I’m afraid she’ll go to jail!”
