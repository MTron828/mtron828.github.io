750 Forced Kiss

Qiao Nian clenched her right fist involuntarily, but she pretended to be calm. She shook her head and said, “I don’t want to.”

She suddenly thought of something and continued, “If Xiao Qi’s mother comes back one day, I can leave at any time.”

As soon as she finished speaking, she felt a chill run down Gu Zhou’s spine. She looked down slightly and saw that the document in Gu Zhou’s hand was already twisted by him.

Qiao Nian sensed Gu Zhou’s displeasure and explained, “Xiao Qi’s mother will definitely give him more maternal love. You’re Xiao Qi’s father. The two of you should have been husband and wife. That way, the two of you can give Xiao Qi more love. Moreover, in this world, no one can replace the position of his mother in Xiao Qi’s heart.”

“Do you really want Xiao Qi’s mother to come back?”

“Of course. What Xiao Qi wants most is for his mother to come home so that he can have a complete family.”

Gu Zhou was deep in thought. His expression darkened as he enunciated each word clearly. “You can also be his mother.”

“This is different. What Xiao Qi wants the most is his biological mother.” Qiao Nian analyzed it seriously. “If his mother comes back, I’m willing to return this position to her.”

“His mother is long gone!”

“What do you mean by long gone? Is she dead? Or can’t be found for the time being?” Qiao Nian asked, frowning.

“I can’t find her.”

“As the saying goes, if she’s alive, we have to see her. If she’s dead, we have to see her corpse. In her current situation, we can only consider her missing.” With that, Qiao Nian paused for a moment before asking, “Are you looking for her now?”

Gu Zhou nodded. “There’s been no news of her.”

Qiao Nian’s expression grew more and more serious. No wonder she hadn’t found out where Gu Qi’s mother was previously. Now, it seemed that she had gone missing.

The Gu family was very powerful. Even Gu Zhou couldn’t find Xiao Qi’s mother, so it was even harder for her to find her.

Qiao Nian pondered for a moment before asking with concern, “Is there anything special about Xiao Qi’s mother? Where’s her birthmark? Do you have a photo of her? What’s her name? I can help you find her!”

Gu Zhou felt his chest grow more and more uncomfortable. Suppressing his discomfort, he asked in a low voice, “Do you really want his mother to come back?”

“Of course. Moreover, Xiao Qi really wants his mother to come back. Don’t you want her to come back?” Qiao Nian asked in confusion.

Gu Zhou’s face grew darker and darker, so dark that ink could drip from it. He narrowed his eyes slightly and stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian. His voice was even hoarser than before. “If she appears, your status will be affected.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Qiao Nian nodded and said, “I know. I’ve said it before. I’m willing to give it up. What… are you doing… um…”

Before she could finish speaking, Gu Zhou had already sealed her mouth with his.

Gu Zhou’s lips were very hot, so hot that her ears turned red. Her face instantly turned red.

She felt as if her entire body was on fire. She couldn’t help but blush. Instinctively, she wanted to push Gu Zhou away, but just as her hand touched Gu Zhou, he grabbed it.

Gu Zhou pressed her onto the sofa and held her hand firmly. His kiss was as crazy as a tornado.

Qiao Nian was stunned. Gu Zhou was kissing her while he was awake.

This…

This man!

Why would he kiss her?

Could it be Gu Chuan?

It didn’t seem like it.

She was certain that the person who had kissed her just now was Gu Zhou, not anyone else.

Under Gu Zhou’s kiss, Qiao Nian’s consciousness gradually sank. She no longer had the strength to resist.

Just as Qiao Nian thought that she would suffocate from lack of oxygen, the man finally let go of her.

Qiao Nian’s hand was free. She reached out to push Gu Zhou away from her neck. Just as she was about to push him away, she heard Gu Zhou’s gentle and lustful voice.

“Nian’er…”

Qiao Nian’s hand froze awkwardly in midair. She hesitated for a moment, then gradually retracted her hand. She lay there calmly, not speaking.
