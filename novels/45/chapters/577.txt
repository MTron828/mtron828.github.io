“Please, no!”

“Oh, no…”

In the darkness, Qiao Nian resisted helplessly, trying to stop the man from pressing himself against her. However, the man was much stronger than her. She tried hard to resist the man’s invasion, and her tears fell uncontrollably.

However, her strength gradually dissipated, but she still couldn’t stop the man’s demonic claws.

She could clearly hear the sound of clothes tearing. The defense on her body gradually disappeared.

… .

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but hug Gu Zhou tightly, trying hard to forget all the images in her mind.

Gu Zhou sensed that Qiao Nian was becoming more and more anxious, as if she wanted to resist the fear in her heart.

She was trying to distract herself.

His frown deepened. If Qiao Nian continued like this, it would only get worse.

With this thought in mind, he reached out and pushed Qiao Nian away.

“Gu Zhou—” Qiao Nian’s drawl carried a trace of charm and coquettishness. She pressed her body against Gu Zhou, her eyes moist. “Don’t you want me?”

Gu Zhou’s frown deepened. He didn’t speak, but looked at Qiao Nian coldly.

“Don’t you want it? It’s now or never.” When Qiao Nian said this, she was almost leaning against Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou’s expression darkened. He disliked the current Qiao Nian very much. At this moment, Qiao Nian was completely restrained by her extreme desires. She wanted to use one thing to forget another.

It wasn’t love.

It had nothing to do with physical desire either.

Instead, she felt as if she had thrown caution to the wind. She wanted to use this stimulation to resist the fear in her heart.

“Qiao Nian, are you treating me like a tool?”

There was a trace of anger in Gu Zhou’s cold voice.

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s voice, she gradually came back to her senses. The fear in her eyes gradually disappeared, leaving behind her usual composure. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

If it weren’t for Gu Zhou, she would still be controlled by desire.

Only then did she notice that she was sitting on Gu Zhou. She subconsciously got off him and hurriedly distanced herself from Gu Zhou.

She clenched her fists tightly, her nails digging into her palms. The pain made her sober up even faster.

What had she just done?

She pounced on Gu Zhou, who had an aversion to women, and wanted to use him like a tool?

How… how could she be so bold?

Qiao Nian stole a glance at Gu Zhou. Seeing his dark expression, she thought that he was angry at her for being rash.

“I… I’m sorry. I didn’t do it on purpose just now,” Qiao Nian stammered. She didn’t know how to explain herself either.

His footsteps were getting closer and closer. Qiao Nian lowered her head and saw that Gu Zhou had already walked up to her.

“You only want to do it once with me?”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She looked up at Gu Zhou, confused.

“One time won’t satisfy me,” Gu Zhou said expressionlessly. “One night is more like it.”

Qiao Nian was speechless.

Just as Qiao Nian was at a loss for words, Gu Zhou picked her up like a princess.

Qiao Nian instinctively wanted to jump down, but Gu Zhou’s grip was stronger. She couldn’t break free at all. “I-I’m fine now. I can walk on my own.”

“I’m sorry. I really didn’t know you were so afraid of the dark.”

Gu Zhou’s voice came from above. The uneasiness and grievance in Qiao Nian’s heart gradually dissipated, leaving only peace of mind.

Following Gu Zhou made her feel even more at ease.

“Mrs. Gu.”

Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou. He wasn’t looking at her, but ahead.

“It’s been hard on you taking care of Gu Qi,” Gu Zhou said calmly. Although Qiao Nian had taken the initiative to hide the fact that the two of them were married, even if she didn’t say anything, he would still ask Qiao Nian to cooperate with him and hide the truth.

At the end of the day, it was still his fault.

“I don’t feel wronged.”

“It’s a long night. Why don’t we confirm our marriage?” As Gu Zhou spoke, he looked down at Qiao Nian in his arms and saw that her face was flushed red.
