“Who brewed this medicine?” Qiao Nian turned to look at the butler and asked sternly, “Why did you add so much safflower?”

The butler glanced at Qiao Nian and frowned slightly. He said, “I weighed the ingredients for the medicine myself, and brewed it myself too. I followed Doctor Su’s prescription exactly.”

Qiao Nian’s expression grew darker and darker. She frowned slightly. She trusted the butler. He would never do anything to harm her grandmother.

Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou and said, “Someone wanted to harm Grandma by swapping the medicinal ingredients in the medicine cabinet!”

The butler did not know much about medicine. All he knew was to select the medicinal herbs according to the labels on each compartment of the medicine cabinet.

Gu Zhou turned to look at the butler and said coldly, “Lock the medicinal room. Investigate who’s been in there lately.”

‘When Jiang Yue heard Gu Zhou’s words, a trace of panic flashed across her face. However, she quickly steadied herself.

“Second Sister-in-law, aren’t you always in the medicinal room?” Jiang Yue smiled coldly, looking at Qiao Nian with heavy suspicion.

Once again, Jiang Yue’s words attracted everyone’s attention.

After all, Qiao Nian was the only one who entered the medicinal room on a regular basis. If Qiao Nian swapped the herbs in the medicine cabinet on purpose, no one would notice.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian calmly. His face was expressionless, and she couldn’t tell what he was thinking.

Qiao Nian gave an impassive smile and looked at Jiang Yue with contempt. “What a joke. If I wanted to poison someone, why would I use such a crude method? Why would I let everyone know that I’m the culprit? Am I that stupid?”

“Second Sister-in-law, you’ve only joined the Gu family for a few days, and this has happened.” Jiang Yue sneered and said disdainfully, “Does this really have nothing to do with you?”

Qiao Nian smiled coldly at Jiang Yue, her beautiful eyes filled with anger. “I didn’t expect Miss Jiang to be so good at fabricating fiction. Looks like you can become a screenwriter!”

“Second Sister-in-law, why did you change the medicinal herbs in the medicine cabinet?” Jiang Yue fired the question at Qiao Nian, her expression stony. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Nian ignored Jiang Yue and picked up the bowl of medicinal dregs again. She wanted to see what kind of ingredients had been used.

In the beginning, Grandma only had a cold and a fever. Why did she become poisoned after taking this medicine?

Could it be that some medicinal ingredients had come into conflict with each other?

Indeed, that was the case.

Qiao Nian had to admit that the culprit was quite a clever person.

Qiao Nian narrowed her eyes and looked up at Jiang Yue. If she remembered correctly, Jiang Yue studied medicine as well, and she had already received a PhD.

“In the cold medicine, there’s an extraneous dose of safflower. There shouldn’t have been a problem with the combination of these and my medicine, but because the dosage of the safflower was incorrect, Grandma was poisoned.” Qiao Nian said coldly, a slight frown on her face.

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, everyone was stunned.

Qiao Nian walked over to the table and looked at the teacup Matriarch Gu had drunk from. There was the faint smell of Chinese medicine emanating from the teacup. She brought the cup to her nose. Sniffing carefully, she caught the scent of safflower.

“There are traces of safflower in this cup.” Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Jiang Yue’s face, and she handed the cup to the servant. “Go and investigate if this bow! has been previously soaked in safflower solution.”

Jiang Yue turned pale. She remained quiet.

Qiao Nian didn’t name names. Instead, she continued, “This person is very smart. They know that Grandma’s pulse will go haywire when she takes the medicine. It might seem as if she’s got a cold or a fever, but if she takes medicine which contains safflower, she’ll be poisoned. She might go into a coma,

but if it’s serious, she’ll die.”

Gu Zhou’s eyes were filled with ice. His hands were clenched tightly into fists as he swept his gaze over everyone present. It was as if he were a wild beast about to capture its prey. His gaze was suffocating, striking fear in everyone who met his eyes.

Doctor Su leaned over and carefully looked at the two portions of medicinal dregs. He nodded thoughtfully. “Indeed!”

At this point, Doctor Su no longer dared to look down on Qiao Nian. He sensed that this young lass was quite capable.

Jiang Yue coughed twice. Glaring at Qiao Nian resentfully, she raged, “Qiao Nian, why did you harm Grandma? Grandma likes you so much. She’s treated you so well.. Do you still have a conscience?”
