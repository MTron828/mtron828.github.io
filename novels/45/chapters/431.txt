Ah Rao’s face was still as calm as ever. He did not even blink. Just as Gao Quan’s face was about to touch his face, he leaned back slightly, and Gao Quan’s fist brushed past his face.

He raised his hand slightly and grabbed Gao Quan’s arm.

Crack!

It only took Ah Rao a moment to dislocate Gao Quan’s arm.

Before Gao Quan could react, his other hand was dislocated by Ah Rao.

Gao Quan endured the pain and took a step back. He raised his leg and was about to kick Ah Rao in the stomach.

However, Ah Rao grabbed Gao Quan’s leg and neatly broke it.

“Ah!”

Gao Quan couldn’t help but shout.

Gao Quan fell to the ground, his face pale and covered in cold sweat. He looked at Ah Rao indignantly.

He had never expected this young man to be so skilled.

He was no match for this young kid.

......

The onlookers were also shocked.

This young man was really too powerful. He was actually able to cripple Gao Quan.

One had to know that in MY, Gao Quan’s skills were considered top-notch.

No one dared to underestimate this young man now.

In less than ten seconds, this young man had only moved a few times before easily crippling Gao Quan.

What was terrifying was that this young man had been standing in place the entire time. He had only used his hands.

Oh my god, this young man was really too powerful!

Gao Hong was so frightened that her entire body was trembling. When she regained her senses, she hurriedly pounced on Gao Quan and cried bitterly.

“Dad, how are you? Are you okay?”

Gao Quan was a martial artist, so he endured the pain.

When he first came to MY, he had also felt this kind of pain. However, later on, when he had money, he had already forgotten most of the pain in the past.

Gao Quan breathed rapidly. He tried his best to ease the pain in his body. Only then did he realize why Wang Chuan did not dare to move when he saw this young man.

If he wasn’t wrong, Wang Chuan must have known this young man.

This time, he had underestimated his opponent.

Everyone looked at Ah Rao.

Ah Rao slowly buttoned up his sleeves. His expression was calm, as if he did not take Gao Quan seriously at all.

Qiao Nian stood at the side and saw with her own eyes how Ah Rao had attacked just now.

She was not weak either, so she naturally understood that Ah Rao was stronger! Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

She did not expect the bodyguard Gu Zhou had hired for her to be so powerful.

It really suited her taste.

When the surrounding young misses who were watching the commotion saw Ah Rao’s skills, their faces turned red with embarrassment.

He was simply too handsome.

He would make a good boyfriend!

If they had such a boyfriend, they would definitely be reluctant to go out. They only wanted to be with their boyfriend every moment.

Except …

Who exactly was this man?

“Do you know who he is?”

“I’ve never seen or heard of him before!”

“He just popped up?”

“Did he seem familiar to you?”

“As long as he’s handsome, of course he looks familiar. Handsome people all look alike!”

“That’s what I mean. Do you think his nose and lips look a little like Lu Zhu’s?”

“From what you’re saying, it sounds a little similar. Could they be cousins?”

“That’s impossible!”

“I know. He’s the man you’ll never have!”

“Why would such an outstanding man be Qiao Nian’s bodyguard? How good would it be if he were my bodyguard!”

… .

Ah Rao stood there calmly and looked down at Gao Quan. His tone was calm, without any of the arrogance from before. “Mr. Gao, do you still want to continue fighting?”

This greeting seemed to be meant to mock Gao Quan.

He looked like he did not take Gao Quan seriously at all. This was a great humiliation to Gao Quan.

Gao Hong looked at Ah Rao angrily and said, “You’re really too much. I won’t be polite to you for bullying my father like this!”

“It’s fine. Don’t stand on ceremony. You can also get someone to deal with me!” Ah Rao said calmly.
