1140 Good Taste

“Eldest Brother and Second Brother, when you came out to pick up Sister, no one actually called me in advance!” When Lu Rao smiled, there was a hint of roguishness. He glanced at Lu Nian and frowned slightly. “Second Brother, you’re too unethical. You told me that I have to wear warm clothes and not freeze. If I freeze, Sister will feel sorry for us. You chose a casual outfit for me and even insisted that I wear a down jacket, hat, and scarf!”

Lu Rao originally wanted to wear a suit, but after hearing Lu Nian’s nonsense, he focused on keeping warm. Just as he came out, he saw his second brother spreading his wings like a male peacock!

Before Lu Zhu could speak, Lu Jiang walked out as well. He was wearing a dark suit and a coat. This coat was the same coat he had given Qiao Nian previously. He would pretend that his sister had worn this before!

“Why are you here?” Lu Jiang tidied his scarf briefly and glanced at the three people at the door.

Before everyone could speak, a pleasant female voice came from inside. “Oh my, why are you all here?”

Lu Qi looked at her brothers in surprise.

Lu Zhu frowned and looked at Lu Qi in surprise. “Where did you go?”

“I don’t have class this afternoon, so I went home early!” Lu Qi said with a smile. She had never told her brothers about what had happened yesterday.

In Lu Qi’s opinion, the matter yesterday had already been resolved. There was no need for her to tell her brothers about that at all.

Lu Qi was wearing a light gray sweater, jeans, and a white down jacket!

“You have good taste today.” Lu Zhu glanced at Lu Qi. Usually, Lu Qi wore loose and casual sports clothes. Other than wearing gowns at banquets, it was rare for Lu Qi to dress so elegantly.

“My taste has always been good, okay?” Lu Qi rolled her eyes casually and said proudly, “My previous clothes were very fashionable. Brother, to be honest, if we weren’t siblings, I would definitely call you Uncle if I saw you on the road!”

Lu Rao couldn’t help but laugh out loud. He sized Lu Zhu up and said in agreement, “Brother isn’t old but he does look old.”

“It doesn’t matter if you’re old. You don’t have a girlfriend yet.” Lu Qi added fuel to the fire fearlessly.

Lu Zhu took a deep breath and said calmly, “It’s useless to tease me. You have to think about whether your legs can be saved.”

A gust of wind blew past, chilling everyone’s hearts.

…

Gu Zhou drove to the entrance of the Lu family villa and parked the car at the side.

Before Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian got out of the car, Lu Qi had already run to the passenger door. Smiling, she opened it. “Sister!”

“Qi Qi!” Qiao Nian smiled at Lu Qi, then at her brothers not far away. “Eldest Brother, Second Brother, Third Brother, Fourth Brother!”

Lu Qi took Qiao Nian’s arm and walked towards her brothers. She moved closer to Qiao Nian’s ear and whispered, “Sister, I have to tell you great news later.”

Qiao Nian smiled at Lu Qi, her eyes filled with curiosity.

Lu Qi raised her head proudly and puffed out her chest, blinking playfully. “It’s really great news!”

“Are you cold? Shall we go in and talk?” Lu Zhu said, his heart aching when he saw that Qiao Nian’s nose was red from the cold. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Yes, yes, yes. It’s cold outside. Let’s go in quickly.” Lu Qi was also worried that Qiao Nian would catch a cold.

Qiao Nian recalled that when Gu Zhou drove over, her brothers and Lu Qi were all standing at the door. That meant that they had been standing outside for a long time.

How could she be as cold as someone sitting in the car?

However, Big Brother was only concerned about whether she was cold. He had forgotten that they were cold.

Qiao Nian was touched. Just as she was about to speak, a stern female voice came from the side.

“Why are you all standing at the door? Do you still want dinner?”

Hearing this voice, everyone fell silent.

Qiao Nian looked over and saw a woman in white pajamas standing in the courtyard.
