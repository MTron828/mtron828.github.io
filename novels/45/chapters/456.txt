Chapter 457: Excitement

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Today, Miss Qiao was like a majestic god of war. She held a cannon and blew up Jiang Chi’s house, starting the first attack.

This was simply too awesome!

At the side, Chen Shi was already so shocked that he could not speak. He could only stand there quietly and witness all of this because he felt that he could not interfere at all.

Chen Shi couldn’t help but wonder if they were filming a police film.

Qiao Nian glanced at the watch on her wrist and said coldly, “It’s time to light the fire!”

Beside Qiao Nian, Su Han nodded. Just as he took out his lighter and was about to light it, the door to Jiang Chi’s hall opened.

A white-haired man of about fifty walked out of the hall. This person was the butler of the Ghost City, Jiang Wen.

With a modest smile on his face, Jiang Wen walked up to Qiao Nian and bowed slightly. He said politely, “Miss Qiao, Master Jiang invites you in to have a seat!”

Su Han’s first reaction was to refuse. “No!”

Jiang Wen’s expression changed slightly when he heard Su Han’s words. In the Ghost City, he was second only to one person, and no one had refuted him for a long time.

Qiao Nian looked at Jiang Wen coldly and went straight to the point. “I’ve already brought the Moon Goddess over. I can also hand it over to Jiang Chi personally, but you have to let Lu Zhu go first. If I don’t see him, I won’t go in. Jiang Chi can forget about getting the Moon Goddess!”

When Jiang Wen heard Qiao Nian’s words, he smiled and explained, “Miss Qiao, it was all a misunderstanding previously. Master Jiang never wanted to hurt you. It’s just that the person who gave this order was a guest of our master.”

Jiang Wen clapped his hands gently.

Two mercenaries walked out. They carried out Song Yue, who was covered in blood and had fainted, and threw her at Qiao Nian’s feet.

Qiao Nian lowered her eyes slightly, her gaze landing on Song Yue. She frowned slightly.

Jiang Wen smiled and said, “Our Master Jiang values etiquette the most. Miss Song Yue had secretly given an order to kill you, and it had already frightened Miss Qiao and caused Mr. Lu Zhu to be seriously injured. Therefore, our Master Jiang has already punished her and even instructed her to be handed over to you to deal with!”

Qiao Nian’s expression remained unchanged. Before coming here, she had already hacked into the hotel she had been staying in and checked the surveillance cameras. Song Yue had indeed interacted with the four mercenaries.

However, what Qiao Nian did not expect was that Song Yue would actually be willing to work for Jiang Chi for her own selfish desires. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

One had to know that Jiang Chi was known as the King of Hell. What was so good about asking a tiger for its skin?

It was simply stupid.

Although Qiao Nian didn’t believe Jiang Wen’s words, her tone was more polite than before. She said, “Since there’s a misunderstanding, please ask Mr. Jiang Chi if he can send Lu Zhu out. If that’s the case, we’ll go our separate ways in the future.”

When Qiao Nian said the last four words, she dragged out the last syllable.

The threat in her words could not have been more obvious.

If Jiang Chi attacked Lu Zhu, don’t blame her for being rude.

Jiang Wen felt a slight chill. He had not expected this little girl to be so calm. Not only was she not afraid of them, but she was also threatening and warning them.

She was indeed an interesting little girl.

No wonder Master Jiang treated her differently.

Jiang Wen was only stunned for a moment. Then, he revealed a gentle smile and said with a troubled expression, “Actually, it’s also our teacher’s intention not to send Mr. Lu Zhu out. Mr. Lu Zhu’s injuries are very serious now, and the doctor is on the way. I’m worried that if we send him out now, his injuries will worsen!”

When Qiao Nian heard Jiang Wen’s words, her heart couldn’t help but skip a beat. A sense of helplessness instantly welled up in her heart.
