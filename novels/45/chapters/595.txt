Gu Zhou sat down next to Gu Qi and followed his gaze. After looking for a long time, she still didn’t know why he was staring at the forest.

“Little Qi, do you want to watch cartoons?” Gu Zhou asked softly. He had previously investigated what children liked to do, so he took out his tablet and found an animated film. He clicked on the screen and placed it in front of Gu Qi.

The laughter coming from the cartoon seemed to have nothing to do with Gu Qi. He continued to sit there motionless, staring blankly ahead.

Seeing Gu Qi like this, Gu Zhou recalled what Zhang Yi had done to Gu Qi in the past. Hatred welled up in his eyes, and he yearned to tear Zhang Yi into pieces.

“My friend has a child. The situation is similar to this.” Qiao Nian frowned, thinking of Gu Qi’s expression.

Gu Qing was already used to people making things up out of nothing. She didn’t expose her and said with a smile, “I need to see the patient with my own eyes to confirm if he’s autistic.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Qiao Nian looked troubled. Frowning, she said, “He caught a cold recently, and it’s not convenient for him to come out. Moreover, I’m worried that if he finds out that I’m taking him to see a psychiatrist, he’ll develop a resistance.”

Gu Qing smiled and said, “Then can he speak?”

“Yes, but he doesn’t want to talk when there are many people around. He speaks in private.”

Gu Qing’s eyes flickered. She continued, “Then is his speech coherent? How’s his logical thinking?”

“Yes, he speaks very clearly. His logical thinking ability is also very strong. Moreover…” Qiao Nian paused for a moment before continuing, “I suspect that his IQ is even higher than children his age.”

The smile on Gu Qing’s face grew brighter. She continued, “I’m guessing that this child doesn’t have autism.”

Qiao Nian was stunned for a moment. “But he usually doesn’t speak. He doesn’t say anything no matter what people ask. Moreover, he was once abused by a nanny.”

“If that’s the case, then the reason why he hasn’t spoken is very likely because he’s pretending to be autistic to seek attention.” Gu Qing frowned, staring unblinkingly at Qiao Nian. She had a vague guess.

“That’s unlikely, because his parents don’t have time to visit him.” Qiao Nian frowned. Thinking of Gu Qi’s past life, she couldn’t help but sigh.

“Doctor Qiao, may I ask if he’s your child?”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She hurriedly shook her head and said, “No, he’s just a child of a friend of mine.”

“Is that so?” Gu Qing clearly didn’t believe Qiao Nian’s words. A bright smile appeared on her face as she said, “When Doctor Qiao mentioned that child, you looked worried. Only a mother would look like that.”

Qiao Nian’s expression changed slightly. She sighed and said, “I treat him as my own child.”

She had two poor children that died the moment they were born. Perhaps it was because of this that she couldn’t help but treat Gu Qi as her own child.

It seemed that Doctor Gu was very capable. Just by speaking to her, she could tell that she had given birth.

“Doctor Qiao, that child needs company and attention. He just wants to pretend to be autistic and crave attention.” Seeing Qiao Nian deep in thought, Gu Qing continued, “Real autistic patients can’t clearly express their needs, nor can they speak.”

Qiao Nian thought of Gu Qi’s situation and seemed to understand. She said to Gu Qing gratefully, “Thank you. I know what to do.”

Gu Qing smiled and didn’t speak. At this moment, she felt that Qiao Nian might really not be the mother of that child.

… .

Seeing that Gu Qi was still motionless, Gu Zhou pursed his lips. When Qiao Nian was around, Gu Qi was especially obedient. It seemed that he could only wait for Qiao Nian to return.

As Gu Zhou thought about this, his gaze inadvertently fell on the location of his phone. Seeing that Chen Qing had returned, he stood up and walked towards the study.

He didn’t notice that Gu Qi had just looked at his phone screen.

Gu Qi was left alone in the room. He blinked.

Was Auntie coming back?
