Song Yu lowered her gaze slightly and ate her porridge silently. She had a bold guess. Could it be that the Song family was related to the Europeans?

At the thought of this, Song Yu gripped her chopsticks even harder.

Song Yu wanted to investigate those things, but if she interfered, she would definitely expose her. Then…

Gu Zhou looked at Qin Chuan and continued, “Lu Rao and Lu Jiang will arrive in An City this afternoon. When the time comes, they’ll protect the Lu family, and the Lu family will be safe. Nian’er and I have decided to go to Europe this afternoon. When the time comes, I’ll leave everything in An City to you.”

Qin Chuan also wanted to go to Europe to take a look. He wanted to know who was so bold, but when he thought about how Qi Qi might be hurt if he left, he sighed helplessly. He looked at Gu Zhou and said, “Alright, be careful there.”

Qin Chuan thought about how it was not safe no matter where he was. After all, the enemy was hiding in the dark. What made him even more uncomfortable was that those people were actually related to the Europeans.

He knew in his heart that Gu Zhou was telling him these things because he had already treated him as a close friend and trusted him very much.

Qin Chuan glanced at Qiao Nian, who was sitting opposite Gu Zhou. With a serious expression, he said, “Then you have to protect Nian Nian well. If anything happens, call me anytime.”

Gu Zhou nodded.

After dinner, Chen Qing put away the things on the table.

Song Yu said, “Qi Qi, I’m going back to the production team. You have to be careful. Call me if you need anything.”

Lu Qi smiled and nodded. “Sister Song Yu, I’m really fine. Go ahead and do your thing. Don’t worry about me.”

Song Yu bid farewell to the others one by one before leaving.

About half an hour later, Qiao Nian looked at Qin Chuan and said, “I’m going to Europe. I’ll help you insert a few needles first. During this period of time, drink the medicine according to the prescription I gave you. When I return, we’ll proceed with the second step of treatment.”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Qin Chuan nodded. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qin Chuan sat on the hospital bed while Qiao Nian stood at the side, helping him with the acupuncture.

After she inserted the needle again and took it out, she looked at the pale Qin Chuan and asked, “How do you feel?”

As Qiao Nian asked this, she glanced at Lu Qi from the corner of her eye. Lu Qi looked at Qin Chuan nervously.

Qin Chuan raised his hand and massaged his temples. He frowned and said in a low voice, “It hurts a little.”

Qiao Nian put away the disinfected silver needles and said, “You probably won’t be feeling well after the acupuncture just now, but you will feel much better after some time. If you feel unwell when I go to Europe, you can call me directly.”

Qiao Nian looked at Qin Chuan and frowned slightly. If her grandfather was around, he would definitely be able to treat his illness very quickly.

She regretted not studying medicine harder back then. Her medical skills were not good enough.

Seeing Qiao Nian’s worried expression, Qin Chuan gave a relieved smile and said softly, “It’s fine. There’s no hurry for me to regain my memories. However, this trip to Europe will definitely be very dangerous. Be careful on the way. Don’t be injured.”

“I know.” Qiao Nian nodded. She looked up at Lu Qi and saw her staring unblinkingly at Qin Chuan, as if Qin Chuan was the only one left in the world. “Qi Qi.”

“Huh?” Lu Qi came back to her senses. Smiling at Qiao Nian, she said gently, “Sister.”

“Don’t go out on your own,” Qiao Nian said with a smile.

Lu Qi nodded seriously. If the tunnel explosion was not investigated, she really did not dare to go out.

Qiao Nian retracted her gaze and looked at Qin Chuan again. She instructed seriously, “In the next period of time, take good care of Lu Qi. Don’t let her get hurt again.”

When Qin Chuan heard Qiao Nian’s words, he looked up at Lu Qi, who was standing not far away. The corners of his lips curled up slightly. He smiled and said, “Mm, don’t worry. I’ll definitely take good care of Qi Qi.”

When Lu Qi heard Qin Chuan’s words and met his affectionate eyes, her heart was in a mess. She blushed and lowered her head, not daring to look at Qin Chuan again.

Seeing Lu Qi’s shy expression, the smile in Qin Chuan’s eyes deepened.
