Qiao Nian glanced at Gu Zhou’s phone and said thoughtfully, “If Qin Chuan discovers that the tunnel has collapsed, he will definitely accelerate. Let’s follow a range of six to eight kilometers.”

Qiao Nian followed Gu Zhou in the indicated direction. She took out her phone and glanced at the data on the map, then at the black marks on the huge rock. Her expression changed and she quickly walked over. When she smelled the smell, she gasped.

“Ah Zhou, come and take a look.” Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou not far away and said solemnly.

Gu Zhou walked towards Qiao Nian. When he reached her, he looked in the direction Qiao Nian was pointing and saw the black substance remaining in the cracks on the huge rock.

He walked over with a dark expression. He didn’t have to get close to smell the gunpowder. “It’s gunpowder!”

Qiao Nian frowned. She had studied medicine with her grandfather. From the beginning, her grandfather had taught her how to improve her sense of smell. When she and Gu Zhou walked here, she smelled a strange smell. She didn’t expect it to really be gunpowder! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“This isn’t a natural disaster. Someone did it on purpose.” As Qiao Nian spoke, she clenched her fists so tightly that her knuckles turned white. She yearned to drag that person out and send him to the police station.

Qiao Nian didn’t know why this person would blow up the tunnel. Could it be that he wanted Qin Chuan or Lu Qi dead?

Qiao Nian pursed her lips tightly, trying hard to remain calm.

Gu Zhou reached out and patted Qiao Nian’s back, as if comforting her. Then, he took out his phone and called Chen Qing.

The call went through very quickly. Gu Zhou said, “Chen Qing, starting from the tunnel entrance, gunpowder has been found six kilometers away. Contact the police now. The tunnel didn’t collapse naturally, but was man-made.”

Seeing Qiao Nian looking around solemnly, Gu Zhou knew that she was still investigating if there was any other gunpowder. “Get the police to change into anti-explosive suits.”

After hanging up, Gu Zhou looked at the traces of gunpowder on the huge rock with a heavy heart.

Previously, he had guessed that someone had planned this collapse, but he did not expect those people to be so crazy as to use gunpowder!

“Here.”

Qiao Nian’s voice came from not far away. Gu Zhou quickly walked over and saw that the huge pit in front of Qiao Nian was filled with black residue. There was a strong smell of gunpowder. If it weren’t for the fact that the wind was strong, they would have smelled it long ago.

“How much gunpowder did they use?” Gu Zhou asked, frowning.

In the tunnel, after Chen Qing hung up, goosebumps instantly appeared on his arms. He shouted in fear, “Retreat! Everyone, retreat! There’s a bomb!”

With that, Chen Qing took a few steps back. There was a violent rumble behind him, and a wave of heat came from behind.

Chen Qing could only bring the two people beside him to lie down and shouted, “All of you, lie down!”

Chen Qing raised his arm to protect his face. After a long while, when the heat wave subsided, he stood up and turned around to see that the hole they were preparing to enter had once again been sealed off by the explosion.

His mind was buzzing, as if there was a thick membrane covering his ears. He couldn’t hear anything.

He looked at the people he had brought along. One by one, they stood up in a sorry state. They were more or less injured. Only then did he recover.

When he regained his hearing, he sensed his phone ringing. He took it out and saw that there were already more than a dozen missed calls. They were all from Second Young Master.

As soon as the call went through, Chen Qing heard Qiao Nian’s anxious voice.

“Chen Qing? Chen Qing, can you hear me? How are you now?”

Chen Qing picked up his phone and opened his mouth to speak, but his throat felt terrible. He covered his lips with his hand and gestured for everyone to leave. He stood alone on the spot and looked at the huge rock blocking the tunnel in front of him, frowning.

“Madam…”

…

Qiao Nian gripped Gu Zhou’s phone tightly. The cell phone was on speaker, and Chen Qing’s weak voice could be heard.

She heaved a sigh of relief, her eyes slightly red.

Fortunately, Chen Qing and the others were fine.
