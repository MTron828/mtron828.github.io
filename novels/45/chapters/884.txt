885 Little Puppy

Seeing that Gu Zhou had woken up, Qiao Nian hurriedly looked at him, her eyes filled with nervousness and unease.

As soon as Gu Zhou woke up, he saw many strangers standing beside him. A trace of surprise flashed in his eyes, and he subconsciously wanted to escape.

Qiao Nian noticed Gu Zhou’s expression and narrowed her eyes.

How could Gu Zhou look afraid?

What exactly was going on?

Gu Zhou looked around, his eyes lighting up when his gaze finally landed on Qiao Nian’s face.

He hurriedly sat up and hugged Qiao Nian’s waist, burying his head in her chest, looking afraid and asking for comfort.

Qiao Nian was stunned.

Gu Zhou would not do such a thing.

Everyone in the ward was stunned. Seeing Gu Zhou like this, the nurses looked at Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou with stars in their eyes, eating dog food on the spot.

Oh my god, so he was a little puppy!

Where did she find such an obedient and adorable little puppy?

The doctor looked at Gu Zhou and took a step forward. “Patient, how do you feel now? Do you need a checkup?”

Seeing the doctor approach, Gu Zhou’s frown deepened. He hugged Qiao Nian tightly.

Qiao Nian realized that something was wrong with Gu Zhou. She asked, “What’s wrong…”

He looked up at Qiao Nian, her face reflected in his eyes. He said pitifully, “Nian Nian, Zhou Zhou hurts…”

The nurses who were eating dog food at the scene were all stunned. Their eyes were filled with love.

When Chen Qing walked in, the nurses stared at Second Young Master like wolves and tigers.

Chen Qing glanced at Gu Zhou again and frowned slightly. He had a bad feeling.

At Qiao Nian’s signal, he chased the doctors and nurses out.

“Alright, it’s fine. Everyone, disperse…”

The nurses looked at Gu Zhou reluctantly and walked out.

“Oh, that man is so handsome. I want such an obedient little puppy too!”

“That man’s voice is so beautiful. My ears can get pregnant!”

“I’m envious of others for having a handsome little puppy!”

The nurse’s voice trailed off.

The doctor stood in the ward for a long time, unwilling to leave. He still wanted to speak to Gu Zhou, but when Gu Zhou saw him, he hugged Qiao Nian tightly and buried his head in her arms, looking unwilling to speak to him and very afraid.

In the end, the doctor was sent out under Chen Qing’s unfriendly gaze.

After Chen Qing sent them all out, he closed the door of the ward.

Seeing that the others had left, Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief.

Just now, with outsiders here, she did not dare to speak casually, afraid that others would discover Gu Zhou’s abnormality.

She had never expected Gu Zhou’s second personality to appear.

Some time ago, Gu Zhou’s third personality, Gu Chuan, had already fused with Gu Zhou himself. Moreover, Gu Zhou’s condition was very stable. She had already forgotten about Gu Zhou’s second personality, Zhou Zhou.

In the past, she discovered that Gu Zhou’s second personality only appeared when he was in extreme pain.

What had just happened must have agitated Gu Zhou. Gu Zhou must have recalled what had happened when he was young, which was why Zhou Zhou had appeared.

Qiao Nian suddenly realized something. After suffering such a huge blow today, would Xiao Shi split into other personalities in the future? Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

She wondered if Gu Zhou’s schizophrenia would be inherited.

If that was the case, then she would have to spend a lot of time with Xiao Shi in the future to let her forget all the unhappiness.

Qiao Nian knew in her heart that the reason why Gu Zhou had developed this personality was definitely because he had been in a lot of pain when he was young.

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian’s heart softened. She gently patted Gu Zhou’s back and said gently, “Zhou Zhou… don’t be afraid. No one will hurt you. I’ll always protect you!”

Qiao Nian let go of Gu Zhou and bent down, looking straight into his eyes.

His eyes were no longer as cold and arrogant as they usually were. His eyelashes were trembling slightly like butterfly wings. His eyes were filled with fear and unease, indicating his true feelings.

At this moment, he was very afraid.

Seeing him like this, Qiao Nian panicked. She had seen Zhou Zhou this way. In the past, Zhou Zhou had never looked afraid.
