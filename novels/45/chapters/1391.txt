Qin Chuan nodded gently and sat up with Qiao Nian’s help. Thinking of how Song Yu had said that he was injured because the tunnel had collapsed, he asked curiously, “Nian Nian, why did the tunnel collapse?”

“Senior, you need to rest well now and conserve your strength.” Qiao Nian helped Qin Chuan sit up and placed her bag on a cabinet at the side, then took out a silver needle.

When Qin Chuan saw the silver needle in Qiao Nian’s hand, a trace of surprise flashed in his eyes. Was this needle really used to treat illnesses and not to kill?

Although he was very puzzled, he still trusted Qiao Nian wholeheartedly.

When he realized this, he found it a little unbelievable.

…

After Song Yu walked out of the ward, her expression instantly darkened. She muted her phone and walked out. Only when she walked out of the hospital area and into the garden did she look at her cell phone.

There were six missed calls on the cell phone.

Song Yu gripped her cell phone tightly and called back with a cold expression.

The other party picked up almost instantly. Without waiting for the other party to speak, Song Yu said with a dark expression, “What exactly do you want to do?”

“Aren’t you afraid that I’ll expose your identity?” Song Xue threatened calmly.

Song Yu’s eyes were cold, and they gradually turned vicious. “Go on, tell me what you want to say. I don’t care!”

“What? Aren’t you afraid that they’ll chase you out of the Lu family?”

“If you dare to attack Lu Qi again, I’ll definitely chase you to the ends of the earth!” With that, Song Yu hung up mercilessly and looked at the lake in front of her, panting. She lowered her head and deleted all her contact information about Song Xue. She sat on a lounge chair at the side and gradually calmed down.

A breeze blew past, and Song Yu felt a trace of coolness. Her lips curved up slightly. She slowly stood up and walked towards the lake step by step. If she took another step, she could jump in.

Song Yu stood by the lake. The goldfish in the lake swam freely, just like her now.

Lu Nian’s face suddenly appeared in front of her. She seemed to have thought of something, and her eyes gradually dimmed. They were filled with grievances.

She took a deep breath and turned to walk towards the inpatient area. She still had to stay by Qi Qi’s side, lest those people attacked her.

…

In the ward.

Qin Chuan sat on the hospital bed with his eyes closed. His head was filled with all kinds of silver needles.

In the beginning, he had a terrible headache. Slowly, the pain gradually disappeared and he felt more and more comfortable.

A fragment appeared in his mind.

The tunnel collapsed. He drove quickly, trying to get the girl in the front passenger seat out of the tunnel.

However, the boulders blocked the way forward. He barely managed to park the car in a safe triangle. The sound of boulders rubbing against the wall came from above. Through the windshield, he saw an entire boulder crashing down. He rushed desperately towards the terrified girl in the front passenger seat.

He could feel his feelings for her back then. Even if only one of them could survive, she would definitely be the one to survive.

He could sacrifice everything for her, even his life.

Qin Chuan still wanted to try his best to see who it was. The footsteps coming from outside the door pulled him back to reality.

Qin Chuan suddenly opened his eyes. Thinking of what he had just seen, his grip on the bedsheets tightened involuntarily.

Doctor Lin pushed the door open and entered. When he saw so many silver needles inserted into Qin Chuan’s head, his expression changed. He frowned and questioned, “What are you doing?”

Doctor Lin walked to the bed. He wanted to pull out the silver needles from Qin Chuan’s head, but he didn’t dare to move them. With a dark expression, he questioned, “You don’t know that the structure of a human brain is very complicated. You can’t insert needles casually. You’re simply fooling around. Don’t move. I’ll call the Chinese medicine doctor in the hospital now and ask him to come over and take a look!”

“There’s no need. I can handle it.” As Qiao Nian spoke, she glanced at the time on her phone and prepared to remove the needles.

“No, don’t move. Miss Qiao, this is a matter of life and death. You…”

Before Doctor Lin could finish speaking, he was interrupted by a cold voice. “Shut up.”
