Mr. Chen raised his fingers and elegantly adjusted his glasses. He stared intently at Qiao Nian, his eyes dark and bottomless.

From the moment Qiao Nian started cutting the jadeite, he had already noticed her.

Qiao Nian’s technique was very meticulous and bold. Mr. Chen was sure that Qiao Nian was already raising the stakes.

Mr. Chen’s eyes narrowed slightly. He was sure that as long as there was jade in the raw stone that Qiao Nian had cut, this piece of jade would definitely increase in value. This was because she had already used the method to cut out the most perfect and complete jade with the least loss.

A bodyguard walked up to Mr. Chen and nodded slightly. “Mr. Chen, Jiang Chi’s subordinates are also here!”

The coldness in Mr. Chen’s eyes increased. He said indifferently, “I understand!”

“Then do they need to take precautions?”

Chen Xiansheng heaved a sigh of relief. A complicated look flashed across his eyes as he said, “Just keep an eye on Lu Zhu!”

“Understood!”

After the bodyguard left, Mr. Chen’s gaze remained on Qiao Nian.

As for Qiao Nian herself, her mind was filled with thoughts of cutting raw materials, so she did not notice the gaze that was fixed on her from upstairs.

Qiao Nian’s gaze gradually hardened. She had found it!

Qiao Nian followed the direction of the crack and cut it down without hesitation.

......

The old master and Zhang Yong were the closest, especially Zhang Yong, who was immediately covered in sweat.

Jesus!

How was that possible?

What was that?

Zhang Yong was so frightened that he swayed.

The old master who was cutting couldn’t help but exclaim, “Oh my god, it’s actually glass imperial jade!”

When Zhang Yong heard his master say this, he fell to the ground in shock.

What had he just done?

He almost cut this glass imperial jade into pieces.

At the thought of this, Zhang Yong was so frightened that his back was covered in cold sweat. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

At this moment, everyone was shocked!

Gao Hong was dumbfounded. When she regained her senses, her heart was in her throat.

No.

Impossible!

How could this lousy stone have glass imperial jade?

Everyone approached to take a closer look at the results.

Qiao Nian had already taken out the jadeite.

This piece of jade was about the size of her fist. Its color was very unique, and under the sunlight, it was a very beautiful emerald green.

Oh my god, this was simply the perfect imperial green of the glass species!

The reporters at the side hurriedly took out their cameras and took photos of the jadeite in Qiao Nian’s hands.

This piece of jade appeared to be a different color under the flashes of the camera. It looked sun-green, but also seemed to be lake-blue.

Even if there were a few cracks on the left and right sides of this piece of jade, these scraps could still be used as decorations.

It was really a glass-type imperial green.

“Oh my god, there’s really two hundred yuan worth of imperial jade!”

“No, no, it’s actually a 200-dollar raw stone with imperial jade inside!”

The valuation experts at the scene came over and began calculating.

“Last year, the chairman of a company, Mr. Su, also opened a glass-type imperial jade. That piece of jade is only a quarter the size of this piece of jade. At that time, the estimated price was about 400 million yuan. Until now, it has already reached nearly 500 million yuan. Then, if you remove the corners of this imperial jade, it will be at least 1.2 billion to 2 billion yuan!”

As the expert finished speaking, his entire body trembled uncontrollably. He almost fainted!

“At that time, Mr. Su spent 200 million yuan on stone gambling for the glass imperial jade. However, Miss Qiao Nian only spent 200 yuan!”

In comparison, Mr. Su was really a fool.

Even so, everyone was still envious of Mr. Su.

But it was imperial jade!

It was the imperial jade of the glass species!

Such things were priceless.

Qiao Nian was too lucky. She had only spent 200 yuan.

Two hundred yuan!

This was too worth it!

She was so lucky!
