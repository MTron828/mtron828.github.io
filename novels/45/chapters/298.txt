Chapter 299: Indignant

At this moment, Gu Zhou’s cold voice rang out.

“For Grandma’s sake, I’ll let you off this time. If there’s a next time, even if you’re Grandma’s biological granddaughter, you can forget about leaving the Gu family alive.”

With that, Gu Zhou walked out. The snake followed him and climbed onto his body.

Jiang Yue looked at Gu Zhou’s figure as he walked out. Tears gradually filled her eyes, and her vision gradually blurred. Finally, she couldn’t help but cry.

Why?

She just wanted to test Qiao Nian. Why did she have to suffer so much and almost lose her life?

If Qiao Nian didn’t like that child, what would Brother Ah Zhou do?

Moreover, when exactly did Brother Ah Zhou have that child?

How many secrets did Brother Ah Zhou have?

Why didn’t Brother Ah Zhou see what she was doing? She was clearly doing this for his own good.

What puzzled her even more was why Grandma liked Qiao Nian so much. Brother Ah Zhou had also become able to interact with the opposite sex because of Qiao Nian!

All of this had happened after Qiao Nian entered the Gu family villa.

This was unfair!

This wasn’t fair at all.

She was truly indignant!

…

In the bedroom.

After Qiao Nian carefully put down the violin, she wore a bathrobe and went to the bathroom.

Lying in the bathtub, the water was barely warm to her shoulders. She relaxed. It was a comfortable feeling.

Suddenly, there was the sound of things colliding outside. It seemed that someone had moved something in. After a while, it was quiet outside.

Qiao Nian no longer had any intention of taking a bath. She dried herself off, put on her bathrobe, and walked out. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

As soon as she stepped out of the bathroom, she saw Gu Zhou packing her things.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion and walked over. She frowned slightly and asked in confusion, “What are you going to do with my things?”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s voice, he turned around and met her wary fox-like eyes.

He stood up straight and glanced at Qiao Nian. She seemed to have just taken a shower. Her face was still flushed, and she smelled faintly of milk.

The fragrance lingered in his nose, and Gu Zhou’s breathing involuntarily became erratic.

Gu Zhou looked away indifferently and picked up the things he had packed. “Put your things in the cabinet.”

Qiao Nian frowned, even more confused. “Why?”

Gu Zhou said, “You’re the mistress of this house. Of course, you have to place your things properly. How can you just leave them there?”

“I thought that was a good idea.” Qiao Nian was slightly stunned.

“What if someone moves them around randomly?”

Qiao Nian frowned slightly. Logically speaking, no one would dare to enter Gu Zhou’s room.

Ignoring Qiao Nian’s words, Gu Zhou swiftly put her things away. His gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face again and he said, “You don’t have to sleep on the sofa anymore!”

Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat. Flattered, she looked at Gu Zhou. “Why?”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s question, his dark eyes stared unblinkingly at her. His thin lips parted slightly, and his low, hoarse voice was magnetic as he enunciated each word clearly. “You’re the mistress of this house. Of course you have to sleep with the male owner in the future!”

Qiao Nian was confused.

Gu Zhou’s words seemed to strike Qiao Nian like a bolt of lightning, making her dizzy.

Qiao Nian felt her face heat up. She didn’t need to look in the mirror to know that she was blushing.

Gu Zhou walked towards Qiao Nian and approached her step by step.

Suddenly, a strong sense of danger surged into her heart. Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou warily, subconsciously taking a few steps back. However, she had only taken two steps back when she reached the wardrobe. There was no way out.
