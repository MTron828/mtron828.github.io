1139 Ritual

“There’s no need, Second Brother. When I get home, I’ll just get the butler to open the door for me.” Qiao Nian didn’t understand why Second Brother had mobilized so many people. She hurriedly refused.

“Sister Nian, you don’t understand. This is a ritual. Alright, be careful on the way.” With that, Lu Zhu hung up.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but laugh, her heart warming. She hadn’t expected her brothers to value her so much when she returned home this time.

“Just now, Second Brother said that he wanted to pick us up at the door…”

!!

Before Qiao Nian could finish speaking, her phone rang again.

She looked down at her cell phone. The caller ID was Lu Rao.

“Who called?” Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian.

“It’s Third Brother. I’ll pick it up first and see what Third Brother has to say.” Qiao Nian smiled at Gu Zhou. After answering the call, she placed the phone to her ear. “Third Brother.”

“Sister, where are you now?” Lu Rao’s magnetic voice came from the cell phone. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I might not be home until later,” Qiao Nian said honestly.

“Second Brother, why did you enter my room?”

Lu Rao’s surprised voice came through the phone.

Lu Nian’s voice sounded. “I’m here to help you choose a suitable gown.”

“There’s no need. I…” Lu Rao was about to speak to Lu Nian when he seemed to have thought of something. He quickly said to Qiao Nian on the phone, “Sister, I have something to do. I’ll hang up first!”

Qiao Nian’s nervousness instantly disappeared without a trace. She had thought that she was the only one who was nervous this time. She had never expected her brothers to be nervous too. They were even choosing clothes seriously.

“They’re all looking forward to your return,” Gu Zhou said with a smile.

Qiao Nian’s lips curved up slightly. She smiled and nodded. “Yes.”

She had thought that her brothers would not be nervous about this matter. Now that she thought about it, she had misunderstood.

Gu Zhou glanced at Qiao Nian and said softly, “No matter what, I’ll always be by your side.”

Qiao Nian smiled and reached out to hold Gu Zhou’s hand.

At that moment, her phone rang again.

Gu Zhou looked into Qiao Nian’s beautiful fox-like eyes and teased, “Don’t tell me it’s your fourth brother!”

Qiao Nian looked at the caller ID on her phone screen and nodded seriously. “Congratulations, you’ve already guessed it before me!”

Qiao Nian picked up the call and placed the phone to her ear. “Fourth Brother.”

“You’re almost home, Elderly Miss!”

When Qiao Nian heard the words “Eldest Miss”, she couldn’t help but blush. Every time Fourth Brother called her that, she felt as if she was a little princess who was doted on.

“It might be a little late.” Qiao Nian looked at the estimated time on the navigation and said, “We’ll be home in thirteen minutes.”

“Drive slowly on the road. I’ll wait for you at home, eldest miss!”

After Qiao Nian finished speaking to Lu Jiang, she hung up. To be honest, she felt that her sister would call soon. With this thought in mind, she told Gu Zhou the same thing.

“That’s really possible,” Gu Zhou said with a smile.

As soon as she finished speaking, Qiao Nian’s phone really began to ring.

Indeed, it was Lu Qi calling. As soon as the call went through, Lu Qi was also asking how long it would take for Qiao Nian to get home.

This time, Qiao Nian put her phone into her bag with relief. Smiling, she said, “No one should be calling me anymore.”

“I think so.”

…

At the entrance of the Lu family villa.

Lu Zhu was wearing a suit and a down jacket. He stood there in a well-tailored suit, staring at his watch.

“Big Brother?”

Lu Nian was the second to walk to the door of his house. When he saw Lu Zhu, he was slightly stunned. Puzzled, he asked, “Brother, weren’t you busy at the company today?”

“It’s okay.” As Lu Zhu spoke, his eyes were filled with a faint smile. “You don’t seem to be busy at all. It’s almost the new year. Come with me to the company to settle some matters tomorrow.”

“Brother, I’m still very busy. I have to compose a beautiful song for tonight tomorrow. I don’t have time to deal with those.” Lu Nian straightened his tie slightly. He was wearing a white suit. In order to look good, he wasn’t wearing a jacket, and he was wearing plush thermal clothes under his shirt.

Lu Zhu looked at Lu Nian’s refreshing and neat appearance and fell into deep thought.

Should he not be wearing a jacket?
