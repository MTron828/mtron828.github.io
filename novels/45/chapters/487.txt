Chapter 488: Worry

Qiao Nian nodded in agreement.

Qiao Nian asked curiously, “What kind of person is his grandmother?”

Chen Qing looked a little troubled. He pursed his lips and said, “I can’t discuss this behind her back. You’ll know when she comes to the Gu family in the future.”

Hearing Chen Qing’s words, Qiao Nian didn’t say anything else.

Chen Qing had never lied. From what Chen Qing said, the entire Gu family knew about his whereabouts.

If Gu Zhou had not come to An City before, it meant that the man that night was not him.

When she realized that, she felt a strange sense of loss.

But soon, Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief.

Fortunately, it was not Gu Zhou.

She was not willing to be enemies with Gu Zhou. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

At this thought, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but laugh.

She must have been stupid just now. Otherwise, why would she suspect Gu Zhou? Gu Zhou was afraid of women.

Hearing Chen Qing’s words just now, Qiao Nian realized that she didn’t know her husband, Gu Zhou, at all.

She did not understand Gu Zhou’s past, his family, or why he had become like this.

There was also something particularly strange. If it had been any other wealthy family, the parents of the man would have come out to meet the woman.

However, after she married into the Gu family, she did not see the existence of Gu Zhou’s parents. It was as if they did not exist at all.

If Gu Zhou’s parents were already dead, it would definitely be reported on the news.

But now, Gu Zhou’s parents seemed to have disappeared from the face of the earth.

When they came out of the elevator, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but ask, “I’ve been here for so long, but why haven’t I seen Gu Zhou’s parents? Could they be living in Qin City?”

When Chen Qing heard Qiao Nian’s question, he frowned. He didn’t know how to explain the complicated relationship between the Gu family and Qiao Nian. Hence, he could only warn her, “Second Young Madam, don’t mention them in front of Second Young Master in the future. Second Young Master doesn’t like them!”

Seeing that Chen Qing’s expression had changed, Qiao Nian responded faintly, suppressing her curiosity.

“Yes.”

Although Qiao Nian had already agreed not to ask him, she was still very curious.

Chen Qing looked at Qiao Nian’s thoughtful expression. Worried that Qiao Nian would still ask him, he tried to persuade her again. “Madam, you just have to know that Young Master has suffered a lot in the past. Don’t ask these questions in front of him. If he wants to tell you, he will tell you.”

Qiao Nian knew that Chen Qing wouldn’t say much, so she nodded in agreement. “Okay, don’t worry. I won’t ask again.”

“Thank you.” Chen Qing heaved a sigh of relief. He was really afraid that Qiao Nian would continue asking.

After sending Qiao Nian to the hotel, Chen Qing called a few bodyguards to guard her. After making the necessary arrangements, he returned to the hospital.

After washing up, Qiao Nian went to bed.

Her mind was filled with what Chen Qing had just said. She frowned and couldn’t help but sigh.

Then, she thought of Lu Zhu, who was still lying on the hospital bed. She hoped that Lu Zhu would recover soon.

For the entire day, Qiao Nian had been in a tense state. Now that she was lying in bed, the burden on her body had been lifted. She instantly felt much more relaxed.

However, she didn’t even sleep for half an hour when her phone rang.

Dazed, she took her phone without checking the caller ID. “Hello?” she mumbled.

She was still half asleep. Her voice was soft and lazy.

“Qiao Xin is missing.”

When Qiao Nian heard the male voice coming from the phone, she instantly woke up.

It was actually Qiao Yu?

It was unbelievable. Qiao Yu was usually old-fashioned, but now he looked flustered.
