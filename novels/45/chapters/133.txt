Chapter 134 Qiao Shan’s Anger

If Qiao Nian hadn’t caused trouble at the research institute, his darling daughter wouldn’t have made a fool of herself. Now, Su Yan wouldn’t be treating her with disdain either!

Qiao Shan’s eyes were red with rage. He glared viciously at Chen Qing and roared, “Let go of me! Who do you think you are? I’m dealing with my own daughter. What has that got to do with Gu Zhou?!”

“Miss Qiao Nian has already married into the Gu family. Don’t you think that’s relevant?” Chen Qing said coldly.

With that, Chen Qing shook off Qiao Shan’s hand forcefully.

Qiao Shan was no match for Chen Qing. He staggered two steps back.

At this moment, Qiao Xin ran out of the room, sobbing pitifully. She glared resentfully at Qiao Nian for a while, then her gaze finally landed on Qiao Shan’s face.

“Father, after what happened today, I really can’t meet anyone else. Sister was so ruthless, and humiliated me utterly in front of so many people. She didn’t hold back at all. I can’t live like this! Father, I’m really sorry. I won’t be able to stay by your side any longer. Forgive me for not being a dutiful daughter! If there’s a next life, I’m willing to be your daughter again! I’m sorry!”

With that, Qiao Xin ran full-tilt towards a tree. Her expression was one of determination and despair.

Qiao Shan instantly turned pale in fear. Swiftly, he pulled Qiao Xin back, tears falling from his eyes. “My darling daughter! Qiao Xin, you’re my darling daughter. There must be a way to resolve this matter. Listen to your father. You must live well! Even if we have to go bankrupt, your father will find a way to settle this matter for you!”

When Qiao Nian heard Qiao Shan’s words, her eyes narrowed dangerously.

In the past, she had always thought that Qiao Shan and Su Xue were just biased against her. Now it seemed that there was more to this than she had thought.

“Dad, don’t stop me. I really don’t have the dignity to continue living!” Qiao Xin cried until she was out of breath.

“My darling daughter, my darling daughter, you must not die. If you die, how will your mother and I live?” Qiao Shan’s eyes were red. He held on tight to Qiao Xin, worried that Qiao Xin would take things too hard. He vented all his anger on Qiao Nian. Qiao Shan glared at Qiao Nian with hatred written all over his face. “You! You heartless and despicable wretch. It was you who brought such suffering to my darling daughter. Even the valuable plants belonging to the Qiao family have been all given away by you. Look at you now! You even hired a bodyguard to protect you. Do you think I won’t dare to hit you just because of this? Servants! Bring me the whip!”

Qiao Shan was livid.

At this moment, a few servants stepped out of the Qiao family home.

“Take good care of Qiao Xin.” After Qiao Shan handed Qiao Xin over to two of the servants, he said to the remaining servants, “Whip!”

One of the servants handed over a whip that had been prepared beforehand.

Qiao Shan grabbed the whip and pointed it at Qiao Nian. He said to the remaining servants, “The few of you, get this b*tch over here!”

B*tch.

Qiao Nian sneered and clenched her fists tightly, her nails digging into her palms. Her palms were already bleeding, but she didn’t seem to feel any pain.

The servants rushed towards Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian’s gaze swept coldly across everyone. She raised her eyebrow, her voice increasing in volume. “Do any of you dare to touch me?”

At this moment, Qiao Nian’s aura swept across the entire yard. In an instant, the servants who were rushing towards her found themselves subdued.

Qiao Shan watched as his servants retreated one by one. He was so angry that his lips were trembling. The whip in his hand cracked in the air. “You’re rebelling. You’re rebelling against your parents! How did I raise a beast like

you?!”

Yet again, the word “raise” was used.

Indeed, it wasn’t only Su Xue who had never used the phrase “give birth”. Qiao Shan hadn’t as well. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Something sparked in Qiao Nian’s eyes. If she wasn’t a biological part of the Qiao family, perhaps that would be a good thing.

“When did you raise me?” Qiao Nian looked at Qiao Shan coldly.

When Qiao Shan heard Qiao Nian’s words, he turned red with anger. “You ingrate! How did I not raise you? Did you grow up on air? You gave away such an expensive plant just like that. Did you even bother to ask me for permission? Do you still remember your parents? You only think of yourself in every scenario. Selfish beast!”
