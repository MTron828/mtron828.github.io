Chapter 1731 - 1731 Remember Your Place

Wright met Lina’s gaze and subconsciously wanted to dodge, but he couldn’t help but look at her.

The blanket had fallen off Lina. She was wearing a white negligee with silk straps. Blood stained her clothes. She looked like a female general who had fought her way out of hell. One couldn’t look away.

Wright licked his lips, his eyes filled with desire.

To be honest, Lina was really captivating.

Lina looked at Wright with killing intent and disgust, as if she was looking at the most disgusting thing in the world. “The murder of a princess is a serious crime!”

The two guards who had wanted to use Via to threaten Lina and Chen Qing let go in fear. They let go of Via in a panic, so frightened that their daggers fell to the ground.

Before Wright brought them here, he had already instructed them not to hurt the Seventh Princess.

However, they had never expected the princess to risk her life for a maid.

Chen Qing looked anxiously at Lina’s injured hand, his eyes filled with worry. However, he couldn’t bandage Lina’s wound directly now. If he relaxed, Wright would definitely escape and get the guards to kill him and bully the Seventh Princess.

Seeing that the others had been frightened off by her, Lina pulled Via towards Chen Qing. There was a hint of a smile in her eyes, as if she was comforting Chen Qing.

“How are you?” Chen Qing saw the blood stains on her nightgown and he felt his hands turn a little cold.

“I’m fine.” As Lina spoke, she placed her hand behind her back, as if this way, Chen Qing wouldn’t be able to see her injuries, and she wouldn’t be injured.

Chen Qing looked at Lina with heartache. She was already injured, yet she didn’t take it seriously. He had seen very clearly just now that her palms were covered in blood. How could she be fine?

Chen Qing took a deep breath. The most important thing now was to deal with Wright. He looked at Wright’s face and recalled the shameful things Wright had done to Lina.

Chen Qing’s anger rose. He immediately wanted to shoot Wright and break his leg.

“Chen Qing.” Lina had long discovered Chen Qing’s thoughts. She grabbed Chen Qing’s arm with her other uninjured hand and said elegantly and calmly, “Wright is a despicable person. He only knows how to use underhanded methods behind our backs. He will never dare to go against us openly. Even if you break his leg now, he will still use even more despicable methods to take revenge on us in the future. Many things can’t be seen on the surface. We have to resolve the problem at the source and settle it once and for all.”

At this point, Lina extended her injured hand in front of Wright. At this moment, her palm was covered in blood. “Wright, is this what you want? This time, you cut my hand. Next time, you will cut my throat. Everyone in the world will know that the Seventh Princess died in your house.”𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Wright’s expression darkened. If something really happened to Lina here, his life would probably be over.

Standing beside Lina, Via was extremely worried. With a sobbing voice, she said, “Seventh Princess, don’t move recklessly. You need to bandage your hand quickly.”

What worried Via the most was that the princess’s hand was injured. If it was just a flesh wound, she would indeed recover after recuperating for a while.

If her bones and tendons were injured, the princess’s hands would probably never be able to…

“It’s fine,” Lina said nonchalantly. She retracted her hand and looked at the blood on her palm. She didn’t seem to feel any pain. “Sometimes, you need to know your place. I can’t be like a certain beast that doesn’t ever know his place.”

As she spoke, Lina looked up at Wright.

Wright was speechless.

With a faint smile on her face, Lina continued, “We should indeed teach him a lesson. After all, it is time for him to pay his dues.”

Chen Qing thought about it seriously and said, “Since his mind is filled with dirty thoughts, why don’t we let him give up on this thought for the rest of his life?”

As he spoke, Chen Qing’s gun gradually moved down from between Wright’s eyebrows, aimed directly between his legs.
