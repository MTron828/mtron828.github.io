Qiao Nian nodded. Since he didn’t specify what it was about, she wouldn’t ask further.

At this moment, Gu Zhou’s slender hands easily pulled off the tie around his neck and threw it into the dirty clothes basket at the side.

His movements were smooth and fluid, making Qiao Nian’s heart race.

But this was her room.

Gu Zhou’s tie had been thrown onto Qiao Nian’s underwear, and she could vaguely see the black lace.

Of course, Gu Zhou also noticed this.

Gu Zhou felt his mouth go dry. He pursed his lips slightly and swallowed.

Qiao Nian felt her temples throbbing. She wanted to walk over to cover it up, but if she did that, it would only make things worse.

Out of sight, out of mind. Qiao Nian walked to the bed and was about to turn off the light.

However, when she passed by Gu Zhou, he unexpectedly grabbed her hand.

Qiao Nian was stunned for a moment. Her heart raced, and she subconsciously raised her hand to shake Gu Zhou off.

Gu Zhou was very strong, and he did not give Qiao Nian a chance to shake him off. With his other hand, he held Qiao Nian’s slender waist.

“Let go of me!” Qiao Nian said in a low voice, frowning slightly.

“Are you going out like this today?” As Gu Zhou spoke, his voice deepened. His gaze landed on Qiao Nian’s chest, and he could vaguely see the beauty of it. His heart couldn’t help but race.

Qiao Nian naturally noticed Gu Zhou’s gaze. She smiled slightly and explained, “This doesn’t count as going out. There aren’t many people outside. Besides, I’m just going to take a look at the end of the corridor.”

Gu Zhou stared intently at Qiao Nian. Her skin was fair, and at such a close distance, he could clearly see every soft strand of hair on her skin. Her beautiful fox eyes sparkled with a hint of charm.

When Gu Zhou met her eyes, his heart skipped a beat, but he pretended to be cold. “This isn’t our country. This is MY. If someone has ulterior motives, do you think you can handle it?”

Hearing Gu Zhou’s words, Qiao Nian looked up into his eyes. At some point, Gu Zhou’s deep eyes seemed to have ignited with sparks.

She looked away uncomfortably and muttered softly, “Aren’t you here?”

The atmosphere in the room suddenly froze.

Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou were very close.

She could hear his every breath and feel his every heartbeat.

For some reason, she suddenly felt as if the air had become hot.

Qiao Nian had a bad feeling about this and instinctively wanted to escape.

However, Gu Zhou’s grip on her hand tightened, not allowing her to leave at all. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Just as Qiao Nian was panicking, she realized that Gu Zhou had let go of her wrist.

The next moment, the room darkened.

“You—”

Before Qiao Nian could finish speaking, she was pulled into Gu Zhou’s arms, and the two of them fell onto the bed.

Everything was dark. All she could feel was the man’s broad chest and his unique fragrance.

For some reason, she remembered that night five years ago.

Even after five years, every time she faced darkness, she would feel flustered and helpless. She could not help but hug Gu Zhou’s neck tightly.

Qiao Nian buried her head in Gu Zhou’s chest, as if he were the light that could lead her out of the darkness.

Gu Zhou was lying on the bed when he noticed Qiao Nian’s strange behavior. He frowned slightly.

Qiao Nian’s reaction had nothing to do with lust. It was as if she was simply afraid…

What was she afraid of?

At this thought, Gu Zhou couldn’t help but stroke Qiao Nian’s back.

Suddenly, Qiao Nian’s expression changed. Without hesitation, she raised her knee.
