Chapter 970 - 970 Heartache for Qiao Xin

970 Heartache for Qiao Xin

When Su Xue heard Qiao Shan’s words, she sighed slightly. “Who would have thought that Qiao Nian was the eldest daughter of the Lu family!”

Qiao Shan sighed heavily. He recalled Lu Zhu’s expression in the afternoon, and his eyes were filled with coldness and disgust.

At that time, Lu Zhu said, “Two days. Only two days. If I don’t see Qiao Xin kneeling in front of my sister with He Cheng to apologize, I will ruin the Qiao family and Qiao Yu. I don’t think Qiao Yu would want to only have one leg left!”

At that time, Qiao Shan had been begging Lu Zhu to let Qiao Xin off.

!!

At that time, Su Xue couldn’t take it anymore. She knelt on the ground and kowtowed to Lu Zhu, hoping that Lu Zhu would be magnanimous and not stoop to Qiao Xin’s level.

Even though they were begging as parents, Lu Zhu still did not relent.

Qiao Shan picked up his chopsticks again. He was getting old. If he was ruined, so be it. After all, there wasn’t much of his future left.

But Qiao Yu was different.

Qiao Yu was a famous genius in An City. Not only could he bring the Qiao Corporation back to life, but he could also improve the Qiao family in An City. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Qiao Yu had studied hard for so many years. Was Qiao Yu going to lose everything and become a cripple because of Qiao Xin’s jealousy?

Qiao Shan’s eyes gradually dimmed. It seemed that he had to tell Qiao Xin what to do.

Qiao Shan looked up at Su Xue and asked, “Did you manage to get He Cheng’s whereabouts from Qiao Xin?”

Su Xue had just scooped a spoonful of soup. When she heard Qiao Shan’s question, she silently put down the spoon and sighed slightly. She shook her head. “I’ve asked someone to look for He Cheng. I don’t think there’ll be any news for a while.”

“Qiao Xin will definitely be able to contact He Cheng. We still have to ask Qiao Xin!” Qiao Shan said coldly. For now, he could only make Qiao Xin suffer.

Su Xue understood what Qiao Shan was thinking, but she still asked worriedly, “Do we really want Qiao Xin to kneel down and apologize to Qiao Nian? Isn’t Lu Zhu’s request too much?”

“Too much?” Qiao Shan’s voice turned cold. He questioned coldly, “If you had treated Qiao Nian better back then and told Qiao Xin not to cause trouble, would there have been so many repercussions?”

Su Xue immediately lowered her head. Actually, no matter what, this was all her fault. If she hadn’t been greedy for so much money back then, today’s events wouldn’t have happened.

One wrong step led to another.

She was getting old and could be shameless. She could kneel in front of Qiao Nian and beg for mercy.

But Qiao Xin was different. She was still young and proud. How could she do such a lowly thing?

Seeing that Su Xue was silent, Qiao Shan asked, “Or do you want the Qiao family to be destroyed in one day and Qiao Yu to be crippled like me?”

When Su Xue heard this, her eyes instantly turned red.

Both Qiao Yu and Qiao Xin were her children. How could she bear to let her child suffer?

“But Xin Xin…”

Qiao Shan was so angry that his eyes turned red. He raised his hand and swept all the food on the table to the ground.

The porcelain shattered into countless pieces, and the ground was covered in food. Even the bed was stained with some food.

Su Xue shrank back in fear.

“Are you trying to get Qiao Yu killed because Qiao Xin? Have you thought about what Qiao Yu will face in the future? He’s the pride of our family. Without Qiao Yu, the Qiao family would have ceased to exist long ago!” Qiao Shan gritted his teeth and said viciously. Why had he married such a stupid fool back then? The family was in chaos because of her.

Qiao Shan recalled that his mother didn’t like Su Xue back then. At that time, he had stood up to everyone and married Su Xue.

He was really blind to have fallen for such an unfaithful woman.

Su Xue shook her head vigorously and explained carefully, “No, no. I’m just wondering if we can think of a way to get the best of both worlds. Not only can we satisfy Lu Zhu, but we won’t let our daughter suffer, nor will we let our son and the Qiao family be hurt!”

“As long as you can think of a way and I think it’ll work, we’ll do as you say!” Qiao Shan said expressionlessly, leaning back against the bed.

Su Xue’s lips parted slightly, and her eyes gradually turned red. If she really had a way, she would have said it long ago.
