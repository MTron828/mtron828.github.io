816 Disillusionment

Initially, he had thought that his mommy was a gentle and kind person, the best person in the world.

But all of that had changed.

He felt that his imaginary mommy was completely different from her.

In the past, he often thought that his mommy must be a very gentle and kind person. She would have a gentle smile on her face, and when she smiled, her eyes would curve into crescents. She would speak gently to everyone.

Perhaps Mommy might not be very beautiful, but she would definitely exude a warm aura.

But the mommy sitting in front of him was completely different from what he had imagined.

His mommy was actually so snobbish, just like Zhang Yi, the nanny who had taken care of him in the past. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Gu Qi stared unblinkingly into Song Man’s eyes and asked, “Since you knew who my father was, why didn’t you tell me?”

When Song Man heard this, she panicked.

She had never told Xiao Shi about her father before. This time, she almost gave herself away.

Song Man had never expected that the first person she would find was Gu Zhou.

Song Man had initially thought that when she gained a foothold in the Lu family, she would let Xiao Shi acknowledge Gu Zhou.

She had let it slip just now because she was flustered.

Xiao Shi had always been smarter than others. She didn’t know how to explain herself to hide what she had just said.

However, Gu Qi did not give Song Man a chance to continue thinking. He asked again, “Since you originally wanted to raise me alone, why didn’t you bring me to Daddy earlier? Why did you only let me acknowledge him now?”

“Xiao Shi, you’ve misunderstood Mommy. That’s not what Mommy meant,” Song Man hurriedly explained. Seeing Gu Qi’s indifferent expression, her eyes instantly turned red, looking very aggrieved.

Gu Qi looked at Song Man’s aggrieved expression expressionlessly.

Song Man sighed softly and said, “Back then, when I gave birth to you and your brother, I fainted because it was too painful. At that time, I vaguely saw Gu Zhou’s face, but I couldn’t be sure that man was Gu Zhou.”

As Song Man spoke, she raised her hand to wipe the tears from the corners of her eyes and sniffled. “Xiao Shi, we lived in Hai Cheng. You should know what kind of place Hai Cheng is. Hai Cheng is a place that eats people alive. The gap between the rich and the poor is so big. When I woke up, I was busy taking care of you, and I didn’t have the money to come to An City. Even if I did, I might not have the chance to see Gu Zhou.”

At this point, Song Man’s voice choked up. “At that time, I wanted you to acknowledge your father. However, our family wasn’t well-off at that time, and we owed a lot of money. Mommy had to support you while paying off the debt. Those debt collectors kept staring at our family. At that time, we couldn’t leave the house directly, right?”

Gu Qi lowered his gaze slightly, his eyes moved.

He had always known that his sister and mommy had a hard time, but he did not expect them to have such a hard life.

Seeing that Gu Qi was listening, Song Man continued, “I’ve been paying my debts for more than two years. Mommy wasn’t in good health. Later on, Mommy wanted to send your photo to your father so that you could acknowledge him. However, Mommy had seen the relevant reports before. Everyone said that he didn’t have a child. Mommy remembered that he took your brother away, so Mommy thought that she had mistaken him for someone else.”

Gu Qi pursed his lips tightly.

At that time, his father had always kept him in the Dongjiang villa. He was unwilling to let him stay in the Gu family’s villa, nor was he willing to make his existence public.

He hadn’t known why his father was doing this before, but now he understood. His father wanted to protect his personal safety.

Now, it seemed that Mommy was right.

He could understand now why his mommy had not told him who his father was when he was young.

Seeing that Gu Qi was listening to her, Song Man couldn’t help but feel smug. “I thought this was your grandparents’ house, but when you mentioned Qiao Nian, I heard about her long ago. Qiao Nian is so outstanding. She’s very close to the Gu family now. She’s Gu Zhou’s private doctor. Since she arranged for you to be here, there’s only one possibility. That man back then was Gu Zhou. I wasn’t wrong back then!”
