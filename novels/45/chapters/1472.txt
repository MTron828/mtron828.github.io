1473 Requesting Help

The president walked up to Lina and gently patted her head, his eyes filled with heartache.

“I’ll rest later. I’m not sleepy now.” Lina smiled at the president and said mischievously, “I slept for a long time today.”

The president nodded. His gaze fell on Qiao Nian, who was standing not far away. His expression was complicated, as if he wanted to say something but hesitated.

Qiao Nian naturally noticed the president’s gaze. She pursed her lips slightly and asked, “Mr. President, is there anything you want to tell me?”

When the president heard Qiao Nian’s question, since she had already made herself clear, he didn’t want to beat around the bush anymore. Hence, he said, “Madam Gu, Lina should have already told you about my Madam’s current situation!”

Qiao Nian nodded slightly.

“My Madam isn’t in good health. I’ve already brought her to all the doctors in Europe, but no one can treat her.” The President paused, his eyes filled with hope. “I know your medical skills are good. I wonder if Madam Gu is willing to treat my Madam?”

The president felt a little nervous as he said this.

Actually, before the president said anything, Qiao Nian had already guessed what he was going to say. However, she still pretended to be a little surprised.

Lina looked at Qiao Nian with sparkling eyes, her expression excited.

Actually, Lina had wanted to use this opportunity to make her father realize that Qiao Nian’s medical skills were really good. When the time came, she would ask Qiao Nian to treat her mother.

However, she did not expect her father to take the initiative to mention it.

Qiao Nian put away the surprise on her face, then looked hesitant.

Seeing this, the president’s heart jumped to his throat. He was a little worried that he had just offended Madam Gu. Madam Gu might not be willing to treat her.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips and said, “I can only confirm the patient’s physical condition after seeing her, but I can’t guarantee anything. Since the President is willing to try, I’m naturally willing.”

When the president heard Qiao Nian’s words, he heaved a sigh of relief. Before he arrived, he had already investigated Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian.

Although Qiao Nian’s past life had been very bumpy, there was nothing strange about it.

Moreover, in such a dangerous situation just now, Qiao Nian could still perform acupuncture on Lina calmly. This was enough to prove Qiao Nian’s medical skills and her attitude.

All these years, he had deliberately ignored everything related to An City because of his wife’s situation.

Since there was nothing suspicious about Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian, the president decided to give it a try. His greatest wish was for his wife to recover.

“Okay.” Qiao Nian gave a gentle smile and said considerately, “If it’s not convenient, I can actually pay Madam a visit.”

When Gu Zhou entered the ward, Qiao Nian and Lina were sitting together, chatting and laughing. They looked very close.

Gu Zhou stood at the door and knocked.

When Qiao Nian saw Gu Zhou, her lips curved up slightly, and her eyes sparkled.

The President noticed that Gu Zhou was staring unblinkingly at Qiao Nian. In a daze, he recalled that when he was with his wife, his attention was always on her. No one else could interfere in their world.

The president was experienced and naturally understood what Gu Zhou meant. He looked at his precious daughter. “Lina.”

Lina smiled at the president and asked, “Yes?”

“Madam Gu has been busy for at least ten hours because of you. She must be especially tired now. She needs to rest.”

As soon as the president finished speaking, Lina slapped her head in realization, self-reproach flashing in her eyes.
