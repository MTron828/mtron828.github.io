901 Lying?

In her heart, her brother had always been an honest and gentle person. She had never expected him to lie.

Could it be that Big Brother knew the owner of that pendant?

Was that why Big Brother had stepped forward to help that friend lie?

Could that person be Gu Zhou?

Qiao Nian grabbed Lu Zhu’s arm and asked impatiently, “Brother, who does the pendant belong to?”

Lu Zhu could feel Qiao Nian’s grip on his arm. He stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian, having a vague guess.

His face had also turned pale. His throat felt as if it was being strangled. For a moment, he couldn’t speak.

Seeing that Lu Zhu was silent, Qiao Nian asked again, “Is it Gu Zhou’s?”

Lu Zhu pursed his lips and nodded.

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Zhu’s words, her face turned as pale as a sheet of paper. Her eyes turned red, and her breathing gradually intensified.

It was really Gu Zhou!

After all the twists and turns, it was still him?

Seeing that Qiao Nian’s expression was ugly, Lu Zhu hurriedly grabbed her hand. Only then did he realize that her hand was as cold as ice. He asked anxiously, “What’s wrong? Are you feeling unwell?”

Qiao Nian didn’t reply.

“Didn’t Wang Lin give that pendant to Qiao Xin? Why are you asking this?” Although Lu Zhu had a guess, he couldn’t make a conclusion unless Qiao Nian made it clear.

Qiao Nian looked at Lu Zhu with red-rimmed eyes. She shook her head gently.

Although she had already guessed the truth of the matter tonight, she was still unwilling to accept it when the truth was in front of her.

Why was God so cruel to her?

The Brother White Shirt she had always loved and cared about the most was actually the person who had hurt her the most.

When she was in the mental hospital, she had thought of looking for that man more than once. She wanted him to suffer a fate worse than death!

Qiao Nian’s eyes grew redder and redder. She felt that she was very stupid. She had never thought that the man might be Gu Zhou.

Perhaps it was because she really believed her brother’s words back then and felt that that person was the thief who had stolen the pendant.

Or perhaps it was because she knew that Gu Zhou was not in An City at that time, so she had never thought that the man was Gu Zhou.

Why?

Did God have to be so unfair to her?

She had been kidnapped. When she grew up, her innocence was ruined and she would had children in a sorry state.

Looking back, her upbringing had been too messy. Nothing had gone smoothly for her.

She still remembered Gu Zhou being honest with her about Gu Qi. Gu Zhou had said that he had been drugged and had hurt a young lady uncontrollably.

At that time, she thought that Gu Zhou had a similar experience as her. She had never expected the two of them to be the exact parties involved in that matter.

Gu Qi and Xiao Shi were both her children. Her only joy was that the two children were still alive.

Qiao Nian felt as if her throat was being strangled. She couldn’t breathe at all, and her mind was buzzing.

Qiao Nian’s vision gradually blurred. Just as she was about to faint, she heard her brother’s worried voice.

“Sugar!”

“Sugar, what’s wrong?”

“Don’t scare me, Sugar!”

…

Qiao Nian gradually came back to her senses. She breathed heavily, feeling the hard-won fresh air.

This suffocating feeling of despair was like the night she was bullied, or the night she heard that the children she gave birth to were dead…

Lu Zhu had already understood what had happened from Qiao Nian’s reaction. His voice trembled as he said, “Sugar, back then, you…”

Qiao Nian’s eyes were red. She smiled self-deprecatingly. “It’s me.”

Lu Zhu pursed his lips and remained silent.

Qiao Nian thought of that matter and asked, “Brother, did he tell you that he was schemed against?” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Lu Zhu met Qiao Nian’s sad eyes and sighed slightly.

If Sugar and Gu Zhou were not husband and wife, he would definitely help Sugar.

But now, not only were Sugar and Gu Zhou husband and wife, but their relationship was also especially good.

Perhaps that was why Sugar was in so much pain.

Lu Zhu lowered his gaze and sighed. “After that incident, he had always regretted not being able to control himself.”
