Chapter 482: Where’s Qiao Nian’s Blood Bag?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Xu Qian looked to be in her thirties. She exuded a gentle aura and gave off a very safe and reliable feeling.

Xu Qian was not from MY, but for her to be able to be the head nurse of this hospital, there must be something special about her. She must be very professional.

Qiao Nian’s eyes darted around as she said gently to Xu Qian, “Miss Xu, can you promise me something?”

Xu Qian’s gaze landed on Qiao Nian’s face. “Miss Qiao, please speak. If I can do it, I will try my best.”

Although Xu Qian hated that she was mistress, she still admired Qiao Nian’s medical skills.

No doctor in the world was younger and more capable than Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian didn’t want to beat around the bush. She went straight to the point. “Miss Xu, I hope you won’t tell Lu Zhu about my blood transfusion.”

Xu Qian was slightly taken aback by Qiao Nian’s words.

Qiao Nian’s expression was serious, as if she had no intention of lying.

Why was there something strange about this?

Logically speaking, Qiao Nian couldn’t wait to be with Lu Zhu. Now that she had done such a good thing, why didn’t she want to let Lu Zhu know?

Seeing that Xu Qian was silent, Qiao Nian felt uneasy. She asked, “Miss Xu, can you help me keep this a secret?”

Xu Qian’s frown deepened. She looked at Qiao Nian in confusion and asked curiously, “Why?”

“I simply don’t want him to feel that he owes me a favor.”

At this moment, Xu Qian felt that she was in a mess.

After a long while, Xu Qian calmed down and said, “Okay.”

“Thank you.” Qiao Nian smiled at Xu Qian sincerely.

Xu Qian suppressed the surprise in her heart and shook her head gently. She said, “We also have a rule here that stops us from revealing the identity of the blood donor. I’m just doing my job.”

Hearing Xu Qian’s words, Qiao Nian instantly felt relieved.

Xu Qian was the head nurse. As long as Xu Qian promised her, she would definitely do it. This meant that Xu Qian would also remind the other nurses who participated in the surgery.

Then, this matter would be suppressed.

Although Xu Qian was filled with doubts, she still said without changing her expression, “Miss Qiao, I’ll be leaving to do my job. Contact me if you need anything.”

“Alright.” Qiao Nian smiled and agreed.

Xu Qian smiled and turned to leave, her eyes filled with confusion.

How strange. Why wasn’t Qiao Nian willing to seize such a good opportunity?

Why did Qiao Nian hide the fact that she had donated blood?

Could it be that Song Yue was lying?

Or rather, Qiao Nian didn’t donate bloo and was afraid that Lu Zhu would find out.

The more Xu Qian thought about it, the more confused she became. No matter what the situation was, she had to find out.

Xu Qian walked towards the nurses’ station with a serious expression.

The nurses who were helping in the operating theater just now were all resting on the table because they were too tired.

Xu Qian walked up to Li Na and shook her.

Li Na opened her eyes in a daze and saw Xu Qian coming over. She asked nervously, “Sister Xu, is Mr. Lu…”

“No, come out with me first.” Xu Qian interrupted Li Na without hesitation.

“Oh.” Li Na yawned as she followed Xu Qian outside, trying to stay awake.

Xu Qian brought Li Na to an empty ward. Seeing how tired Li Na was, she asked with concern, “Are you especially tired?”

Li Na gave a small shake of her head. “I just got some sleep. I’m better now.”

“You can go back and get some rest tomorrow morning.”

“Thank you, Sister Xu!”

Xu Qian pursed her lips and asked, “Where’s the blood bag that Qiao Nian donated?”

Li Na’s expression changed when she heard Xu Qian’s question. She instantly straightened her body and stammered, “Th-that’s in the operating theater!”
