Chapter 264: Double Standards

At that time, Qiao Nian had always felt that the person who could play such a healing song must be an old man who had experienced the vicissitudes of life.

But Qiao Nian had never expected Mr. Dong Hua to be a young man in his twenties.

When she was ten years old, Mr. Dong Hua was already famous all over the world. In other words, Mr. Dong Hua was only in his teens back then.

Mr. Dong Hua was a genius in the music industry.

Wang Xuan was eating her ribs seriously when she suddenly felt a cold gaze on her. The pressure of this gaze was so strong that her hand trembled in fear, and the ribs in her chopsticks fell into her bowl.

Wang Xuan subconsciously looked up and saw Gu Zhou’s dark expression and cold gaze.

Wang Xuan was slightly stunned. She suddenly realized that Gu Zhou wasn’t looking at her. Instead, he was staring at Qiao Nian, who had been staring at Mr. Dong Hua in a daze. She was just a pitiful soul who had been affected.

Wang Xuan’s eyes darted to the side. She picked up a piece of meat and placed it in Qiao Nian’s bowl, saying, “Nian Nian, you’ll have to work hard to teach me the violin later. You have to eat more.”

When Qiao Nian heard Wang Xuan’s voice, she immediately retracted her gaze. Only then did she realize that she had lost her composure again.

Jiang Yue had already seen everything. Her gaze fell on Qiao Nian and Lu Nian, and a cunning look flashed in her eyes. She lowered her gaze thoughtfully.

When Qiao Nian came back to her senses, she realized that Gu Zhou was looking at her with a slightly unfriendly expression.

After all, she was Gu Zhou’s wife in name.

As his wife, it was her fault for staring at another man in front of Gu Zhou.

However, she was really depressed. If only Mr. Dong Hua was an old man. Then, Gu Zhou wouldn’t be staring at her like this. She would be able to stare at Mr. Dong Hua openly.

It was a pity that Mr. Dong Hua was such a beautiful young man.

Smiling, Qiao Nian picked up a piece of shrimp and placed it in Gu Zhou’s bowl. Her brow relaxed and she said softly, “This shrimp tastes especially good. It’s sweet and delicious. It’s also nutritious. You can eat more.”

Jiang Qian, who was sitting at the side, looked at Qiao Nian anxiously.

When Jiang Yue saw this, a trace of joy flashed in her heart. She pretended to be stunned. “Second Sister-in-law, Brother Ah Zhou…”

Jiang Yue had wanted to say that Gu Zhou had never eaten seafood.

However, she saw that Gu Zhou had already calmly placed the prawn in his mouth. He took his time biting it, and savoring it carefully.

Oh my god, when did Brother Ah Zhou eat prawns?

Jiang Yue and Zhao Qian weren’t the only ones who were shocked. Even Butler Ye and Matriarch Gu were stunned.

Gu Zhou had never eaten seafood.

When did Gu Zhou start eating seafood? Why didn’t they know?

Butler Ye looked confused. He tried hard to recall Gu Zhou’s diet.

Matriarch Gu glanced at Qiao Nian, then at Gu Zhou. She understood now. Smiling, she said, “The food today is not bad!”

Jiang Yue rolled her eyes and hurriedly nodded. She picked up another prawn and placed it in Gu Zhou’s bowl, saying ingratiatingly, “Brother Ah Zhou, Second Sister-in-law is right. Shrimp is very nutritious. I didn’t know you liked it…”

“Butler Ye.” Gu Zhou interrupted Jiang Yue, frowning slightly.

Butler Ye walked over to Gu Zhou and asked softly, “Second Young Master, what’s wrong?”

Gu Zhou put down the chopsticks in his hand, glanced at his bowl, and said, “Ask the kitchen staff to help me change the cutlery!”

Jiang Yue was speechless.

Jiang Yue’s face turned pale. Awkwardly, she tried to find a place to hide.

Qiao Nian had also picked up some prawns for him. Why wasn’t he willing to eat the prawns she had picked up?

Could a marriage certificate be so special?

At this moment, Jiang Yue finally understood that Gu Zhou didn’t want to eat seafood. He just didn’t want to reject Qiao Nian’s good intentions.

But why would Gu Zhou reject her?

How was she inferior to Qiao Nian?

Gu Zhou had double standards.

During this period of time, she had been especially obedient. Usually, she would be filial to her grandmother at home.

The housekeeper at home had not found anyone suitable as a replacement. Now, she had to help manage the servants every day.

She had already tried hard to make up for her previous mistakes.

But why did Brother Ah Zhou still treat her like this?

Now that there were outsiders in the family, Brother Ah Zhou did not give her any face at all.
