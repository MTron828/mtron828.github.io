Song Yu scrolled down WeChat. It was all from Song Xue.

Song Xue said, “I’ve long disliked Lu Qi!”

Song Xue said, “If only she were dead this time!”

Song Xue said, “I heard that you’re on good terms with her in the Lu family. I wanted to tell you about this so that you can be mentally prepared!”

…

Song Yu was no longer in the mood to continue reading. She opened her missed calls and saw that they were all from Song Xue. She called her back.

As soon as the call went through, Song Yu’s voice trembled as she asked coldly, “What did you do to Lu Qi?”

Soon, Song Xue’s sarcastic voice came through the phone. “Oh, are you anxious?”

“I don’t have time to tell you anything else. What exactly happened to Lu Qi?” Song Yu gripped her cell phone tightly and asked uneasily.

“Song Xue, let me tell you, I’m your biological sister. You’d better be polite to me!” Song Xue sounded very impatient. “What does Lu Qi have to do with you? You’re just an adopted daughter. Why? Do you really treat Lu Qi as your sister? If she finds out…”

“I’ll ask you one last time. How’s Lu Qi? Did you do it?” Song Yu’s eyes turned red. She had grown up with Lu Qi. Not only were they sisters, but they were also best friends.

“The Wang Village tunnel collapsed and she was buried inside. How do you think she’s doing now?” Song Xue’s tone sounded vicious. “People like Lu Qi should have disappeared long ago. I’m warning you, don’t think that you have the support of the Lu family. If they find out that you’re staying in the Lu family and not leaving, see if they’ll still accept you!”

Song Yu sat there in a daze, tears flowing down her face. She looked at the phone that Song Xue had already hung up on her and threw it onto the seat beside her in pain.

Trembling, Song Yu opened the family group chat and saw that her eldest and second brothers were preparing to go to the Wang Village Tunnel to save Lu Qi.

She recalled what had happened when she was young.

When school ended in junior high, three hooligans from the school blocked her path, insisting that she be their boss’s girlfriend.

At that time, she was timid and did not dare to cause trouble outside. She instinctively wanted to refuse, but when she saw the fierce gazes of the three of them, she instantly cowered.

At this moment, Little Lu Qi, who was still in elementary school, rushed over.

“Sister Song Yu, are the three of them bullying you?” Little Lu Qi held the nunchaku in her right hand and placed her left hand on her waist, looking fearless.

Song Yu hurriedly pulled Lu Qi behind her and said in a low voice, “Let’s go home now. Don’t disturb them.”

Song Yu was worried that the three men would hurt Little Lu Qi without hesitation. That wouldn’t be good.

Song Yu held Little Lu Qi’s hand and was about to leave when the three of them rushed over and blocked their path.

“How dare you bully Sister Song Yu? Let’s see if you have the ability to beat me!” Little Lu Qi waved the nunchaku in her hand.

She knew that Little Lu Qi had learned nunchaku before, but there were three youths now. Even if Little Lu Qi could defeat one of them, she could not defeat the other two!

“Haha, Boss, this little thing still wants to save the damsel in distress!”

“This little fellow is so funny!”

Song Yu was really worried that they would hurt Little Lu Qi. She hurriedly said, “I’ll consider what you said carefully. I’ll give you an answer tomorrow, okay? It’s getting late. We have to go home!”

The tallest and strongest boy of the three walked up to Song Yu and said solemnly, “You’re patronizing me.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Before Song Yu could speak, she saw the boy in front of her instantly turn pale. His mouth was wide open, and he covered his lower body with both hands in a sorry state.

Before Song Yu could react, she saw that Little Lu Qi had already quickly hit the weakest spots of the other two men with her nunchaku. Then, she pulled her quickly towards the middle of the road.

She looked at Little Lu Qi beside her and her heart warmed.

Song Yu came back to her senses. She composed herself and got out of the car. With a guilty expression, she walked towards Director Li, who was eating.

The others looked at Song Yu’s teary eyes in surprise.
