Chapter 270: Is This Necessary?

Wang Xuan looked at Qiao Nian’s smile and was momentarily stunned.

For some reason, she actually felt that Qiao Nian looked a little like Lu Nian.

Wang Xuan hurriedly threw this strange thought to the back of her mind.

“There’s still an hour and a half before class starts. Let’s go over there to practice!” Qiao Nian smiled at Wang Xuan.

“Okay.”

…

At the Gu residence.

Lu Nian sat by the French window of the study on the second floor and stared blankly at the fountain in the courtyard.

Qiao Nian’s voice and smile kept flashing in his mind. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

For some reason, he felt that Qiao Nian looked a little familiar. He couldn’t help but want to get closer to her.

When he first saw Qiao Nian, he saw her suppressing her anger. She looked exactly like his mother.

Moreover, Qiao Nian’s back view was extremely similar to her.

Lu Nian lowered his eyes in disappointment. His long eyelashes fell, hiding the longing in his eyes.

If her sister was still alive, then she should be about the same age as Qiao Nian.

He wondered who his sister would look like when she grew up.

He didn’t know what hobbies his sister would have. Would she be a businessman like his father and eldest brother, or would she like musical instruments like him, or flowers and plants like his mother?

He still remembered how she looked when she was a child, with her hair tied up in two buns. She was so soft and cuddly, like a doll in a New Year painting. She was so adorable that one could not take their eyes off her.

Lu Nian’s eyes teared up.

He raised his head and opened his eyes indifferently, as if as long as he raised his head, his tears would not fall.

Suddenly, Lu Nian’s phone rang.

Lu Nian took out his phone and glanced at the caller ID. He couldn’t help but frown.

With a helpless expression, he answered the call. Holding the phone to his ear, he called out lazily, “Brother.”

Lu Zhu’s voice was very low, and he seemed to be very unhappy. “You’re just looking for a female musician. Why did you log into my Weibo account and repost Brother Cao’s post? You’re simply wasting my resources!”

When Lu Nian heard Lu Zhu mention Xia Xue, his eyes instantly darkened. He hated that lying woman. Coldness appeared in his eyes. “The higher you are, the harder you fall!”

Lu Zhu was slightly stunned. He instantly understood Lu Nian’s intentions and asked, “What exactly are you planning to do?”

“I just helped your school clean up the residue. You should be thanking me!” Lu Nian said bluntly.

Lu Zhu had initially come to interrogate Lu Nian. When he heard Lu Nian’s words, he said angrily, “Just don’t go overboard!”

“Got it,” Lu Nian said nonchalantly. Just as he was about to hang up, he heard Lu Zhu speak again.

“Why didn’t you come back on the anniversary of your sister’s death?”

Lu Nian’s eyes turned red. He pretended to be calm and questioned coldly, “Is that necessary?”

Lu Zhu’s voice trembled. “Don’t let me hear such words again, or I’ll break your legs!”

Lu Nian wiped the tears from his eyes and questioned coldly, “Sister is already dead. Why are you guarding a dead person? Why must you torture yourself day and night? What’s the point?”

“Shut up!” Lu Zhu’s voice was choked with emotion.

Lu Nian stood up and gripped his phone tightly. He frowned and said, “Ever since Sister left, Grandma has been washing her face with tears every day. Her eyes are getting worse by the day.”

Lu Nian swallowed and continued, “Mom and Dad will no longer return to the country because of this matter. What about you? You dream of Sister every night, but so many years have passed. Why won’t you let yourself off? How long more do you want to torture yourself? I’m sure Sister won’t want to see you like this…”

After a long while, Lu Zhu’s voice came through the phone.

“Since you don’t want to come back, don’t come back again. Don’t say these words again.”

Lu Zhu’s voice was low, no longer filled with anger.
