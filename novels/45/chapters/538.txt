Now that the plane had taken off, Lu Zhu could feel the turbulence when it took off. He also knew that he was getting closer and closer to home.

He really wanted to bring his sister home and announce to the world that the eldest daughter of the Lu family was still alive.

But he couldn’t do that.

More than that, he had to hide the truth from the rest of the family and could not tell them that his sister was still alive.

Lu Zhu’s frown deepened. His heart was filled with guilt towards his sister.

Actually, Qiao Nian was also very nervous. She had seen Lu Qi before, as well as Lu Nian and Lu Rao. However, she didn’t know if she should acknowledge them first, nor did she know if they would accept her.

Just as Qiao Nian’s thoughts were running wild, Lu Zhu, who was not far away, opened his eyes. His gaze landed on Gu Zhou’s face as he asked, “Ah Zhou, Ah Rao will be picking you up from the airport later. Do you want to come to my house for a while?” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Only then did Gu Zhou remember that he had specially invited Ah Rao to be Qiao Nian’s bodyguard. He had yet to thank Ah Rao personally for this.

When Qiao Nian thought of Ah Rao, her heart started beating nervously. Without waiting for Gu Zhou to speak, she hurriedly said, “Grandma is alone at home now. She must have been waiting for us for many days. We don’t want Grandma to be too worried. However, given her relationship with Matriarch Lu, we don’t want Grandma to find out that you’re injured. We’ll visit her another day!”

Qiao Nian’s words were cold and distant. Although she really wanted to see her family now, she wasn’t ready yet.

She didn’t know how she would react when she saw them, and she was worried that she wouldn’t be able to help herself. She would have to acknowledge her family, and when that happened, she would be in trouble.

“Alright, let’s go home first.” Gu Zhou didn’t refute Qiao Nian’s words.

Lu Zhu did not speak again and closed his eyes to rest.

Qiao Nian tilted her head to look at the white clouds outside the window, her eyes darkening.

Although she could not acknowledge her family now, one day, she would definitely find out who was behind this and return to her family openly.

Soon, the plane arrived at An City International Airport.

After alighting from the plane, Qiao Nian breathed in the air of An City. Her uneasy heart instantly calmed down.

Home at last.

When Qiao Nian thought of how Ah Rao was waiting outside to pick her up, her heart couldn’t help but race. The closer they got to the exit, the faster she would see him.

When they reached the exit, Qiao Nian looked around but didn’t see Lu Rao.

She frowned slightly. Their group had attracted a lot of attention.

Gu Zhou and Lu Zhu were the most famous people in An City. When everyone saw them, they could not help but whisper.

“Oh my God, my two favorite men are in the same frame now. I’m going to photograph them. The two of them are so handsome!”

“How lucky. I actually saw Mr. Lu and Young Master Gu walking together. Wow, these two are simply too handsome!”

“Hey, who’s that woman beside them? She’s beautiful and has a good aura!”

“She is the famous genius painter, Mr. Huang Shi!”

“What? Mr. Huang Shi is actually a woman! I think she goes by Nan Chuan.”

“It’s like this. I was stunned when I found out. At the last auction, she personally copied the stone wall painting!”

“Why did she use such a strange name!”

“I don’t know!”

“Why does she have the word Chuan in her word? This sounds like a man’s name.”

“Who knows? It might be the name of the most important person in Ms. Nan Chuan’s life. That’s why she used the word Chuan!”

“That makes sense!”

… .

Hearing the others say this, Qiao Nian frowned, and her breathing involuntarily tightened.

That person did matter to her.

Before she knew that Qiao Yu was her biological brother, he was very important to her.
