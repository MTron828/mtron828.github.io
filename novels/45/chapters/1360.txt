1361 How to Explain?

“Three times?” Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief. If it really happened three times a night, would they still be able to sleep at night?

Gu Zhou met Qiao Nian’s surprised gaze and pondered seriously for a few seconds. He looked up at Qiao Nian and said sternly, “If you think three times is too little, how about six?”

Gu Zhou thought that Qiao Nian still wanted to have a child, but she was embarrassed.

However, from another perspective, girls were always shy. It was only right for them to be embarrassed when he suggested such a thing.

As a man, he should take the initiative to say such things. He couldn’t let Qiao Nian have any worries.

Qiao Nian’s eyes widened. She took a deep breath and said, “I really don’t intend to have so many children.”

Gu Zhou lowered his head and planted a kiss on Qiao Nian’s forehead, thinking that she was still shy. “Yes, you didn’t plan to have so many children. I am the one who wants that many children.”

Gu Zhou’s voice was low and gentle, with a hint of doting.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou. She had a nagging feeling that Gu Zhou was just patronizing her. Just as she was about to explain clearly, Gu Zhou’s phone rang.

Gu Zhou took out his phone and glanced at it. He frowned slightly and said, “Something happened at the company. I’ll go to the study for a meeting.”

With that, Gu Zhou turned around and walked out, not giving Qiao Nian a chance to explain herself.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou’s back, her temples throbbing with anger.

How should she make things clear to him?

…

At the Lu residence.

Qin Chuan drove not far from the Lu family villa. There was a trace of fatigue on his face, but his eyes were like stars in the night sky, frighteningly bright.

Qin Chuan looked at himself in the rearview mirror. He tidied his clothes and hairstyle a little before taking out his phone to text.

“I’m here. Where are you?” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The text was sent very quickly.

The other party replied almost instantly.

“Senior, wait for me. I’ll be there soon.”

About three minutes later, Lu Qi walked out of the Lu family villa in a white down jacket and black jeans. When she saw the man standing by the car, she waved at him and jogged up to him.

The weather was good today, and the sun was shining brightly, but it was still snowing.

Lu Qi was still wearing a red scarf around her neck, making her look even fairer against her bright smile. Standing in the snow, she looked very beautiful. Everything around her paled in comparison.

Qin Chuan looked at Lu Qi and couldn’t help but smile.

When Lu Qi ran up to Qin Chuan, a big smile appeared on her face. “Senior Brother!”

The white smoke from her words blurred her face. Qin Chuan couldn’t see Lu Qi’s face clearly, but this hazy beauty made it even harder for him to look away.

Qin Chuan couldn’t help but step forward and touch her face, as if to confirm if he had really seen her, or if all of this was a dream.

“Senior, I have a gift for you.” As Lu Qi spoke, she took off her backpack and took out a black cashmere scarf. She smiled at Qin Chuan. “I bought this for you. Do you like it?”

Qin Chuan’s gaze fell on the cashmere scarf. His lips curved up slightly as he nodded. “Okay.”

Qin Chuan was about to reach out and take the cashmere scarf when Lu Qi stood on her tiptoes, preparing to help him put it on.

When Lu Qi approached Qin Chuan, he could smell a sweet milky fragrance from her. This fragrance was faint.

Qin Chuan’s lower abdomen tightened. He pursed his lips and swallowed, subconsciously holding Lu Qi’s hand tightly.

Lu Qi was slightly stunned. She looked at Qin Chuan in confusion, her eyes filled with confusion.

Her small hands were as soft as he had imagined. Qin Chuan looked at Lu Qi and smiled gratefully. “Thank you for carefully choosing this gift, Little Junior Sister. I like it very much. I’ll do it myself.”

Lu Qi smiled and nodded. She didn’t think too much about it. She placed the scarf on Qin Chuan’s arm and retracted her hand.

When the softness in Qin Chuan’s hand disappeared, he seemed to have lost a piece of his heart. Without changing his expression, he tied his scarf and his gaze fell on Lu Qi’s face. “How is it?”
