956 Her Heart Was Cold

She didn’t dare to ask Qiao Xin either, afraid that Qiao Xin would make the same choice and break her leg.

Her daughter had actually done such a thing.

Su Xue’s heart turned cold.

However, when she thought about how if it really was her and she was asked to make own choice, she would definitely be willing to sacrifice herself to make Qiao Xin’s life better. After all, Qiao Xin was her daughter. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

!!

Su Xue rushed to the door of the operating theater and saw Qiao Yu standing guard at the door, frowning.

After some thought, she walked over to Qiao Yu and asked in a low voice, “What did the doctor say?”

Qiao Yu looked up at Su Xue. Instead of answering her directly, he asked, “Mom, do you think Qiao Xin did the right thing?”

Su Xue met Qiao Yu’s cold eyes and was stunned.

… .

At the Gu family villa.

Gu Zhou got out of the car and walked in. When he thought of how Qiao Nian had almost been bullied last night, he felt especially uncomfortable. He entered the house and walked upstairs.

Gu Qi and Xiao Shi were sitting at the dining table. When they heard the commotion, they craned their necks to look at the footsteps outside.

Matriarch Gu came out of the kitchen. Seeing the two of them leaning against the dining room door, she smiled and asked, “What are the two of you looking at?”

Gu Qi turned to look at Matriarch Gu and smiled.

Xiao Shi walked over to Matriarch Gu and looked up at her. With a serious expression, she said, “Great-grandmother, Daddy went upstairs to look for Mommy just now!”

When Matriarch Gu heard Xiao Shi’s words, a sweet smile appeared on her face. “You guys are really smart!”

Gu Zhou walked to the bedroom door. He had just placed his hand on the handle when he recalled how he had seen Qiao Nian before leaving the Gu family. His heart couldn’t help but ache.

Qiao Nian must have not slept all night. She must have been under a lot of pressure.

He gently pushed the door open and walked in, his footsteps involuntarily lightening.

His gaze landed gently on Qiao Nian’s sleeping face. Seeing Qiao Nian frown slightly, he realized that Qiao Nian might still be trapped in a nightmare.

Gu Zhou was right. Qiao Nian was indeed trapped in a nightmare.

In her dream, she returned to that night six years ago.

The room was very dark.

She was pressed onto the bed by the man.

The man’s hands were as heavy as gold, pressing her down so tightly that she couldn’t move at all.

Fear wrapped around her like a vine. She was terrified, but all she could do was moan.

She knew in her heart that the man was already trying his best to restrain himself. He was already treating her very gently. She was the one who was afraid. She was afraid of everything around her.

At that time, she was like a boat floating on the sea, rising and falling, completely unable to control herself.

Later on, she seemed to be immersed in the sea and could barely breathe.

At this moment, a beam of light seemed to appear behind her, dispelling the surrounding seawater.

Her body kept rising, as if she was standing on clouds.

The gentle sunlight shone on her, warming her up.

“Nian’er…”

Who was speaking? Why was this voice so gentle?

“Don’t be afraid…”

Qiao Nian’s heart suddenly began to race.

“I’ll protect you forever. I won’t let you be hurt. We’ll take care of our children together!”

The man’s voice was low and gentle.

Qiao Nian felt more and more comfortable. At this moment, she felt an itch in her ear and couldn’t help but open her eyes.

“I’m sorry!”

When she opened her eyes, she noticed that someone was hugging her from behind.

Qiao Nian subconsciously wanted to shake off the person behind her, but when she noticed the jade pendant on the man’s hand, she stopped.

Gu Zhou?

Seeing that Qiao Nian had woken up, Gu Zhou tightened his grip and hugged her tightly. He asked gently, “Did you have a nightmare just now?”

Qiao Nian could tell from Gu Zhou’s voice that he was concerned. She nodded casually and recalled what she had heard in her dream.

Had Gu Zhou said that just now?

However, why did Gu Zhou apologize to her?

Could it be that Gu Zhou knew something?

Qiao Nian couldn’t ask Gu Zhou directly, but she was afraid that she would alert the enemy. She asked in a low voice, “When did you come back?”
