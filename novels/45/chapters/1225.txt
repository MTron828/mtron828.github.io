1226 Trust

Just as Gu Zhou was about to say something, Qiao Nian shook her head and said, “I know you’re worried about me, but this time, I have to go alone. This is not only to protect me, but also to protect your brother. If anything goes wrong on our end, your brother might be in danger.”

Qiao Nian smiled at Gu Zhou and said gently, “Don’t worry, with Senior Brother around, he won’t let me be hurt. He’ll definitely protect me.”

Gu Zhou was speechless.

He hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to trust Chang Feng so much. He remembered that they had grown up together.

Gu Zhou felt a little terrible. He and Qiao Nian were engaged when they were young. Logically speaking, the two of them should be the closest people to each other, but in the past twenty years, he had not been by her side…

When he was in An City, he had seen Qiao Nian and Qin Chuan being intimate. They had nothing to say to each other, but they were so intimate that he couldn’t interrupt. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Now, Qiao Nian trusted Chang Feng unconditionally.

His Nian’er actually had so many childhood sweethearts.

Seeing that Gu Zhou had lowered his gaze, Qiao Nian thought he seemed to be unhappy. Thinking that Gu Zhou was worried about her, she smiled and took Gu Zhou’s arm, leaning against it. She said softly, “Alright, don’t worry. I’ll only be gone for a while. I’ll definitely be fine.”

Seeing that Gu Zhou had yet to speak, Qiao Nian continued, “Moreover, he used such a secret method to ask me out. Surely no one knows that we’ll meet. I don’t have to worry about anything else happening during this meeting.

Seeing that Qiao Nian was determined to go, Gu Zhou couldn’t refuse. He nodded and said, “Okay.”

Gu Zhou retracted his arm from Qiao Nian’s hand and reached out to hug her. He rested his chin gently on Qiao Nian’s head and smelled the fragrance of her hair. His voice was a little nasal. “Nian’er.”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s voice, her body stiffened. She said tentatively, “Yes?”

“What’s my ranking in your heart?”

Gu Zhou’s voice was as low and hoarse as ever.

Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. She was really frightened just now. She thought that Zhou Zhou had come out. It seemed that she was overthinking.

However, Gu Zhou’s question was so strange. She did not answer Gu Zhou’s question directly. Instead, she teased him. “Let me count.”

As she spoke, Qiao Nian began to count on her fingers. “Xiao Qi and Xiao Shi are tied for first place. There’s also our third child. He’s also ranked first. Next are Mom, Dad, Brother, and Sister, then Grandma and Grandpa…”

Gu Zhou’s eyes darkened. Qiao Nian had counted a lot of people, but he wasn’t mentioned yet. Did he have no place in her heart?

Without hesitation, Gu Zhou pressed Qiao Nian onto the sofa and covered her chattering mouth with his.

Qiao Nian hadn’t expected Gu Zhou to do that. She let Gu Zhou press her against the sofa.

At the thought of Gu Zhou’s domineering and willful cheap shot, her lips curved up involuntarily.

Gu Zhou was really too adorable like this. She couldn’t help but want to press herself under him.

Just as Qiao Nian was about to suffocate, Gu Zhou reluctantly let go of her. There was a trace of dissatisfaction in his eyes as he said, “Am I that unimportant?”

Qiao Nian’s lips curved up slightly. She wrapped her long arms around Gu Zhou’s neck, a playful smile on her face. She asked in a low voice, “Are you angry?”

Gu Zhou remained silent, his expression cold.

Qiao Nian took the initiative to kiss Gu Zhou before leaving. She lowered her forehead to Gu Zhou’s and smiled. “Of course you’re first.”

Gu Zhou looked at the sweet smile on Qiao Nian’s face. The fire in his lower abdomen quickly ignited and grew larger. He kissed her lips. She was a little cheeky.

Sensing the change in Gu Zhou’s lower body, Qiao Nian’s expression froze.

Oh no, her back would hurt again tomorrow.

The next afternoon, Qiao Nian arrived at the Golden Shore Cafe as agreed. She went to the private room Eldest Senior Brother had specified and took out her phone to casually play a game, slowly waiting for her senior brother to arrive.

When the game was about to end, she heard the door of the private room open. A tall attendant walked in with a menu.
