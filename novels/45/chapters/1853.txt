Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Lu Zhu did not expect Song Yu to appear here. He was gratified that Song Yu was sensible, but his heart ached when he saw the dark circles in her eyes.

“Yu’er?”

“Brother and Sister, I’m really fine.” As Song Yu spoke, she stood up and walked towards the door. She opened the door and glanced outside. Seeing that there was no one outside, she closed the door and walked towards Lu Zhu and Qiao Nian again.

Qiao Nian looked at Song Yu suspiciously, her eyes filled with confusion. However, she could tell that Song Yu wasn’t in a good state now. Just as she was about to speak up and treat Song Yu’s illness, she heard Song Yu say in a low voice, “Brother, Sister, I realized that there’s something wrong with that person. She… she’s not right.”

Song Yu wanted to say “spy” directly, but when she thought about how she suspected Auntie Cao, her words changed.

Qiao Nian looked at Song Yu curiously and hurriedly asked, “What’s wrong?”

At the mention of something wrong, Qiao Nian’s first reaction was to think of Uncle Zhao. If Uncle Zhao hadn’t deliberately leaked the news to those people back then, they wouldn’t have known Qi Qi’s schedule.

“Brother and Sister.” Song Yu looked at the two people in front of her and lowered her gaze slightly, saying in a low voice, “This matter is very complicated. I want to start from the beginning.”

Qiao Nian had been in a hurry to return to Madam President’s place. Now that she heard Song Yu’s words, she was no longer in a hurry to go back. After all, her grandfather would only perform the acupuncture tomorrow. She just had to go back tomorrow morning.

Song Yu took out a piece of paper from her pocket and handed it to Lu Zhu. “Brother, before Qi Qi’s accident, someone called Song Xue appeared in front of me and told me that I was her biological sister. She even asked me to monitor our family’s every move.”

Lu Zhu looked down at the paper in his hand. It was actually the DNA report of Song Yu and Song Xue. He handed the paper to Qiao Nian, who was standing at the side.

Qiao Nian glanced at the piece of paper, then at Song Yu. She didn’t expect Song Yu to say such a thing. She said, “Brother, call the other three brothers in. I think what Yu’er is about to say is definitely very important.”

After a while, other than Lu Rao, who was protecting Madam President, Lu Nian and Lu Jiang both came over. Qiao Nian and Song Yu sat on the same sofa, and the other three brothers of the Lu family sat on the sofa opposite.

There were still people guarding the door.

Lu Nian looked at the report in his hand. It said that Song Yu and Song Xue were biological sisters. He narrowed his eyes and looked at Song Yu with a complicated expression.

If this were any other time, Song Yu might have been very happy that Second Brother was looking at her, but now her attention was all on the teacup in front of her.

“Previously, Song Xue asked me to monitor every move of the Lu family. She even said that Song Man was my biological sister and wanted me to avenge her sister. Naturally, I didn’t agree. Later on, she even threatened me a few times. She even said that if I didn’t listen, she would make it public that I had found my family and was still staving in the Lu family, unwilling to leave.”

Song Yu frowned slightly, her tone a little sad. “I-I still rejected her. I wanted to tell everyone about this, but something happened to Qi Qi, and Sister went to Europe. Everyone was very worried about Sister, so I didn’t say anything.”

When Qiao Nian heard Song Yu’s words, she understood what she was thinking. If it were her, she would also choose to wait for some time until everyone was fine. “Yu’er, I understand. You don’t want everyone to worry.”Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“I originally wanted to wait for Madam President to leave before talking about this, but I realized that something was wrong with Auntie Cao recently. She kept saying in front of me that I wasn’t a member of the Lu family. She even wanted to sow discord between Sister and me.”

As Song Yu spoke, her gaze fell on magnolia-bark, who was lying on the table at the side. “Auntie Cao has instigated me more than once or twice. She told me today that Big Brother had found magnolia-bark for me to treat my insomnia, but she also told me that Big Brother was biased towards Sister and wanted to give magnolia-bark to her.”

Qiao Nian held Song Yu’s hand. Just as she was about to explain, she heard Song Yu say, “But I’m not a fool. I heard it clearly at the door just now. This magnolia-bark is for Madam President of Europe.. It’s also to help remind

Madam President of what happened more than twenty years ago and find the bad person who has been harming our Lu family!”
