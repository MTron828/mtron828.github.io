Qiao Nian didn’t think that Earl Harry had anything to do with this. There must be a reason why he had injured his leg. As for what it was, no one knew.

Gu Zhou thought so too. He looked at Chen Qing and asked, “Then?”

What Chen Qing was about to say next was also the main point of the matter. He said with a serious expression, “Earl Mark was at a disadvantage in the meeting. He directly asked the Earl’s residence to make a statement.”

“Mark claims that he’s deeply angry at what Annie has done. What Annie has done is all Annie’s personal actions. He won’t protect his daughter. If a prince or princess breaks the law, they’ll be punished as well. He’ll get Annie to give everyone an explanation. Moreover, he deeply sympathizes with Madam President and prays to God that she recovers soon.”

Qiao Nian frowned. Annie had become a sacrificial lamb.

Gu Zhou gripped the fork in his hand tightly.

At this moment, Chen Qing continued, “Mark also said that from now on, there will be no Princess Annie in this world. In other words, he has cut ties with Annie.”

When Qiao Nian heard Chen Qing’s words, her expression changed drastically. She said in a low voice, “It’s said that Annie is his only daughter. If he breaks off his father-daughter relationship, does that mean he’s preparing to abandon his only daughter?”

Qiao Nian’s expression grew more and more serious. She hadn’t expected Mark to be so heartless.

She had heard that Mark had many lovers. He wanted to have many children and grandchildren, but the heavens seemed to like to joke with him. He only had Annie as only daughter.

Therefore, Mark later adopted Wright.

If Mark abandoned Annie, it meant that Mark no longer had any weaknesses. No one could control Mark anymore.

Harry knew how to break his leg. Mark was ruthless!

The president seemed to have something else he couldn’t say.

The royal family seemed to have many secrets. If she investigated the kidnapping twenty years ago, she might reveal a portion of the royal family’s secrets.

This matter had become very difficult.

Qiao Nian’s frown deepened. She was facing the entire European royal family.

Sensing Qiao Nian’s worry, Gu Zhou reached out to smooth her frown. Smiling, he said, “Don’t worry, things are actually still very simple.”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion.

Gu Zhou smiled and said, “Mark abandoned Annie to gain a foothold. Harry would rather hurt his leg than attend yesterday’s meeting. That means that Mark and Harry have already joined forces. If Harry didn’t appear, it means that he has taken a stand.”

“Logically speaking, Mark should be able to gain the upper hand and turn the tide to bring Annie out.” At this point, Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian with a smile. Seeing her enlightened expression, his eyes were filled with admiration.

“Are you saying that the president still has something on Mark, so Mark had no choice but to give in and give up his only daughter?” Qiao Nian analyzed it seriously.

“That’s right.”

Qiao Nian’s beautiful fox-like eyes narrowed with a smile. She continued, “Looks like the three-way situation hasn’t changed. The royal family still maintains a balance. In that case, we have a chance to investigate.”

“Yes.” With that, Gu Zhou looked at Chen Qing. “Has anything happened to Earl Harry?”

“No, I heard that Earl Harry’s Madam has already gone on a trip.” Chen Qing paused for a moment and continued, “She’s going to An City.”

“An City?” Qiao Nian frowned slightly, her heart in her throat. “Count Harry’s Madam is from An City?”

“I think so.” As Chen Qing spoke, he took out his phone and sent a photo of Earl Harry’s Madam to Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian. “Someone happened to take a photo of her face.”

Qiao Nian turned on her cell phone and looked at the photo. She frowned slightly and looked at Gu Zhou with a complicated expression. “It’s really too similar. Did you find anything when you investigated her?”

“No,” Chen Qing said bluntly. “Count Harry and his Madam got together twenty-five years ago. At that time, there were endless internal strife in the royal family. They locked themselves in their rooms all day.”
