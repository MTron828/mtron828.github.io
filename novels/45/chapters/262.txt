Chapter 263: Light

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she instantly understood that Gu Zhou was reminding her of her status as Mrs. Gu.

Of course, Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou spoke very softly, so no one else could hear them.

Wang Xuan walked behind them. Seeing how loving Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian were, she instantly believed in love again.

In the past, Wang Xuan had heard from others that Gu Zhou was not in good health and was ill. He would not be alive for long, but looking at Gu Zhou’s current state, she felt that the rumors were not credible.

When they arrived at the dining room, Zhao Qian and Jiang Yue were already waiting there.

Zhao Qian greeted her. “Grandma.”

Jiang Yue arranged for the servants to serve the last dish. Smiling, she walked up to Matriarch Gu and shielded Zhao Qian behind her. “Grandma, the dishes have been prepared!”

“You’ve worked hard.”

A sweet smile appeared on Jiang Yue’s face. Her gaze fell on Lu Nian and she said, “Brother Lu Nian came to our house to play as soon as he returned to the country. Of course, we have to treat him well. How can it be hard work? Brother Lu Nian, don’t you think I’m right?”

Without even looking at Jiang Yue, Lu Nian said unhurriedly, “How can you say that I’m a guest when I’m returning to my own home?”

Jiang Yue smiled and nodded in agreement. “I was wrong. Don’t mind me!”

Matriarch Gu smiled and tried to smooth things over. “Yes, Lu Nian is also my god-grandson. Alright, let’s all relax in our own home. Don’t be so reserved!”

Jiang Yue still wanted to speak to Lu Nian, but Lu Nian walked up to Zhao Qian and asked, “Long time no see. You look better and better.”

“Thank you for your compliment, Brother Lu Nian, but if only I could be as good-looking as you.” Zhao Qian looked up at Lu Nian with a smile.

Lu Nian reached out and pinched Zhao Qian’s nose, saying dotingly, “Nonsense!”

Everyone took their seats.

Qiao Nian could sense from Lu Nian’s words that he didn’t seem to like Jiang Yue. Compared to Jiang Yue, Lu Nian seemed to like Zhao Qian more.

Actually, Qiao Nian liked Zhao Qian more as well. Zhao Qian was more easygoing and lively.

Of course, Wang Xuan could sense it too.

Wang Xuan admired Matriarch Gu’s child very much. She was very adaptable.

Just now, Lu Nian was very dissatisfied with Jiang Yue, but Jiang Yue could pretend to be stupid and not understand what Lu Nian meant.

After Qiao Nian sat down, it took a long while for her excitement from seeing her idol for the first time to subside.

Qiao Nian looked at Mr. Dong Hua, who was sitting opposite her. She still felt that she was dreaming.

Qiao Nian recalled that when she was ten years old, her aunt was cultivating medicinal herbs in her house. Her aunt walked out of the house with her phone and told her that she was talking to Su Xue.

At that time, all she could think about was her mother, so she was especially happy when she picked up the phone. However, when she picked up the phone, she felt as if she had been struck by lightning.

Su Xue had told her that she would never take her back. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Previously, when she was in the countryside, she had been wondering when her parents would be able to pick her up. That way, she could live by her parents’ side, have their love, and lead a happy life.

The little fantasy she had of being doted on by her parents vanished in an instant.

After hanging up, she ran back to her grandfather’s house with her head lowered. Just as she was feeling lost and didn’t know where to go next, she heard Mr. Dong Hua playing a song on the radio.

That lazy, satisfied, and positive tune instantly lit up her entire world like a beam of light.

From then on, there was no longer only gloom in her world. There was only a colorful world bathed in sunlight.

At that time, Qiao Nian had looked down on kinship, but now she yearned for her future.

From then on, Mr. Dong Hua became her only idol.
