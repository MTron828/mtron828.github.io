Gardening?

Had Qiao Nian lived such a refined and leisurely life for those five years?

“How was she able to stay idle?” Qiao Xin asked.

Yang Ze said calmly, “Second Young Mistress Qiao, if you don’t believe me, why don’t I take you there?”

“Alright, thank you for your trouble, Doctor Yang.”

Qiao Xin followed behind Yang Ze and walked towards the small courtyard where Qiao Nian used to live.

Before she reached the small courtyard, Qiao Xin could already smell the fragrance of flowers.

“Miss Qiao, Young Mistress Qiao’s residence is right in front,” Yang Ze explained with a smile.

In front of them was a garden filled with a variety of flowers and plants. The flowers were in bloom, attracting many bees and butterflies.

In the middle of the garden was a small hut.

That was where Qiao Nian used to live.

“Were these all planted by Qiao Nian?” Qiao Xin looked at the flowers in disbelief.

Yang Ze’s eyes were filled with admiration. From the bottom of his heart, he truly respected Qiao Nian. He said, “This piece of land used to be dry and barren. Miss Qiao came here every day to garden for the past five years. She’s single-handedly turned this place into one of the most beautiful areas here in

our mental hospital.”

Qiao Xin nodded and pointed at the hut. “Did she usually live there?”

“Yes.”

Yang Ze brought Qiao Xin towards the wooden hut.

When Qiao Xin walked to the hut, she saw that the door was locked.

“Unlock the door!” Qiao Xin was curious. What was in the hut?

Yang Ze looked troubled. He stammered, “We don’t have the key.”

Qiao Xin’s expression darkened and she clenched her fists involuntarily. Her nails dug into her palms, but she didn’t feel any pain.

How was it that Qiao Nian could enjoy life wherever she went?

“This is a mental hospital. How can you let a patient do whatever she wants? Don’t you know that these gardening tools can pose a danger to her life?” Qiao Xin questioned, forcibly suppressing her rage as she turned to look at Yang Ze.

“Our biggest investor has already approved of Miss Qiao gardening here,” Yang Ze explained.

“Investor? Isn’t our Qiao family the biggest investor here?” Qiao Xin looked at Yang Ze in surprise. Because the Qiao family was the biggest investor in this mental hospital, Su Xue had faced no trouble in sending Qiao Nian here five years ago.

“Two weeks after Miss Qiao entered, someone else has become the biggest investor in our hospital,” Yang Ze said with a serious expression.

“Who is it now?” Qiao Xin asked curiously, frowning.

“Mr. Fang.”

Qiao Xin’s frown deepened. If she wasn’t wrong, Mr. Fang was a hacker.

Very few people had heard of Mr. Fang. It was rumored that Mr. Fang was extremely rich.

If Mr. Fang was so rich, why would he invest in a mental hospital?

What made Qiao Xin unhappy was that she had thought that Qiao Nian would lead a life worse than death here. She had never expected Qiao Nian to lead such a pleasant life here, as if she were a member of a high profession who had chosen to live in solitude, away from society.

Could it be that Qiao Nian and Mr. Fang had an improper relationship? Was that why she received Mr. Fang’s favor and special treatment?

However, Qiao Xin quickly dismissed the thought. Mr. Fang was a member of the high society. Perhaps he had simply taken Qiao Nian to be a gardener here.

Indeed, Qiao Nian had always been a country bumpkin. After all, she had grown up in the countryside. Apart from gardening, she knew nothing else.

At this thought, Qiao Xin felt much better.

Perhaps Mr. Fang had let Qiao Nian become the principal of An University on account of how well the garden had been taken care of.1

It seemed that Mr. Fang was very capable.

Qiao Xin thought that if she could meet Mr. Fang, she would have to be on good terms with him. Perhaps if she managed to get Mr. Fang into a good mood, he would let her become the principal instead.

At this moment, a pickup truck drove over and two nurses alighted.

Qiao Xin watched as the two nurses began to move the plants into the truck.

Could it be that Mr.. Fang had instructed them to move the plants?Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com
