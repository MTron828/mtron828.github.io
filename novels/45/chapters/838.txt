839 Doubts

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he couldn’t help but feel a trace of hope.

If he managed to get custody of Xiao Shi, it meant that Qiao Nian didn’t want him to be with Song Man.

“Then how do you plan to deal with her?” Gu Zhou asked hopefully. He did not want to hear a disappointed answer. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Arrange for a trusted nanny to monitor her every move!” Qiao Nian frowned slightly. Although her next words might make Gu Zhou think that she was hostile to Song Man, she still had to tell Gu Zhou the truth. “I think Song Man might not be Xiao Shi and Gu Qi’s mother. Of course, this is just my intuition, but I don’t have any evidence. Moreover, the evidence shows that she’s indeed Xiao Qi’s mother!”

Qiao Nian sighed and continued, “I know you think I might be hostile to her, but that’s what I think!”

“I’m glad you think so!”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she was stunned.

What was going on? What was Gu Zhou thinking?

She had no evidence to prove that her intuition was right. How could Gu Zhou believe her unconditionally?

“This is just my intuition!” Qiao Nian repeated. “But reality has proven that she’s indeed the mother of two children!”

“So you never thought of leaving me in the first place?”

“No, I just think Song Man is a little suspicious. I hope you can send someone to investigate everything about her!”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou and said solemnly, “I think every mother will dote on her child very much. This is the first time I’ve seen such a heartless mother. I remember when I was young, Su Xue was also so heartless to me back then. In the past, I didn’t understand why Su Xue treated me like this. But now that I know that she’s not my biological mother, I can understand her coldness and disgust for me!”

At this point, Qiao Nian thought of Xiao Shi’s hand and Gu Qi’s face. “It’s also possible that she’s really the mother of two children. It’s just that she’s suffered too much giving birth to these two children, so she’s mentally unstable! I just think that no matter what the situation is, we should investigate thoroughly. We shouldn’t make a rash decision!”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he recalled Xiao Shi’s calloused hands. At that time, he had noticed that Song Man’s hands were smooth and delicate.

Generally speaking, adults did the work, and children did nothing.

According to this logic, Song Man’s hands should look rougher, and Xiao Shi’s hands should be smooth and delicate.

At that time, he hadn’t thought too much about it. His mind was filled with the fact that Qiao Nian wanted to leave him. He didn’t want Qiao Nian to leave him. He wanted to keep Qiao Nian by his side forever.

But now that he had calmed down, he felt that Qiao Nian’s suspicions made sense.

“I understand. I’ll send someone to investigate!” Gu Zhou said thoughtfully. The anger in his body gradually dissipated, leaving only indifference. He looked at Qiao Nian beside him. “So you had no intention of leaving me from the beginning?”

“Of course not!” Qiao Nian said without hesitation. She looked at Gu Zhou in confusion. “Why would you ask that?”

The uneasiness in Gu Zhou’s heart gradually disappeared.

Just now, Qiao Nian had made it very clear that she felt that Song Man wasn’t the mother of the two children, which was why she didn’t have any ill feelings.

What if Song Man was really the mother of these two children?

What would Qiao Nian do then? Would Qiao Nian still leave him?

Realizing this, Gu Zhou’s heart jumped to his throat again.

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face and he asked, “If Song Man is really the mother of two children, what do you plan to do?”

“Do you want to be with her?” Qiao Nian asked calmly.

Gu Zhou frowned and questioned coldly, “What do you think?”

Qiao Nian pursed her lips and said seriously, “I hope you can make it up to her…”

Gu Zhou’s eyes darkened, and his body gradually exuded a cold aura.

“When the time comes, give her a sum of money and let her live somewhere by herself. Then, get someone to take care of her,” Qiao Nian said slowly.

Gu Zhou’s eyes gradually lit up, and he seemed to be bathed in sunlight. The expression on his face softened a lot, and the coldness gradually dissipated.
