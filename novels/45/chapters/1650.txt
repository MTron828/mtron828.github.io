Chapter 1651 Memories

Strange. If she remembered correctly, Cui Huai had not met with anything disastrous at that time.

Qiao Nian looked at Madam President nervously, wanting to hear her answer.

Shen Mei's frown deepened. Strange images appeared in her mind, but she couldn't remember them. She wasn't sure if the name she had heard previously was really Cui Huai.

Shen Mei frowned and said uncertainly, "Perhaps… perhaps it's Cui Huai!"

With that, Shen Mei's face grew paler and paler. Cold sweat broke out on her forehead, and she looked slightly in pain.

Qiao Nian had been paying attention to the change in Shen Mei's expression. Seeing that Shen Mei's expression was getting uglier and uglier, she hurriedly held her hand and said gently, "Madam, if you can't remember, don't think about it anymore. Let's talk about this later. The most important thing now is to recuperate."

Shen Mei looked at Qiao Nian guiltily. Qiao Nian had saved Lina so many times, and even saved her. However, her brain was really useless. She couldn't help Qiao Nian.

Shen Mei said apologetically, "I'm really sorry. You've helped me so much, but I-I can't remember the past. I can't help you."

Qiao Nian smiled at Shen Mei and said gently, "Madam, you don't have to make things difficult for yourself. Actually, Ah Zhou and I were already on the president's side in court today."

She helped Shen Mei lie on the bed. Looking into Shen Mei's eyes, she said gently, "The most important thing for you now is to recuperate."

Shen Mei looked at the gentle Qiao Nian in front of her and nodded slowly.

"Madam, rest well." Smiling, Qiao Nian covered Shen Mei with the blanket before walking out.

She understood why Shen Mei was in a hurry to tell her about what had happened twenty-one years ago. Shen Mei wanted to help the president side with her and Gu Zhou in her own way.

Shen Mei also knew that her husband was helpless against Mark alone.

The hospital smelled of disinfectant.

Qiao Nian walked out of Shen Mei's ward and reached out to close the door. Thinking of Shen Mei's appearance just now, she sighed heavily.

She walked towards Professor Ollie's office. Just as she reached the corner, she saw Gu Zhou coming out of Professor Ollie's office.

The two of them met at the corner.

Qiao Nian was about to speak when she saw Gu Zhou step forward and hold her hand. He said softly, "Let's go back!"

Seeing the calm expression on Gu Zhou's face, Qiao Nian's eyes were filled with smiles. She followed Gu Zhou out.

The two of them walked out of the palace. Qiao Nian sat in the front passenger seat and looked at Gu Zhou, who was about to drive. She smiled and asked, "Is Cui Qi alright now?"

"Yes, he's fine now." Gu Zhou seemed to have thought of something. His hand, which was twisting the key, froze for a moment. He turned to look at her and moved closer to Qiao Nian. "Nian'er, you seem to be very concerned about Cui Qi."

"Isn't Cui Qi our…" Before Qiao Nian could finish speaking, she saw Gu Zhou's jealous expression. She smiled and said, "I'm just afraid that if he dies, we won't be able to find out what happened twenty-one years ago. What's wrong? Are you jealous?"

"My Nian'er keeps talking about Cui Qi. I'm curious if she still has me in her eyes." Gu Zhou stared unblinkingly into Qiao Nian's eyes, seeing his face reflected in them. "Or is it just those unimportant people?"

Qiao Nian took the initiative to move closer to Gu Zhou's lips and planted a light kiss on him. Only then did she move away and ask with a smile, "Do you understand now?"

"Yes." Gu Zhou smiled in satisfaction before saying, "Doctor Ollie said that Cui Qi's surgery went quite smoothly. This is all thanks to the life-saving pill you gave him previously. However, Cui Qi hasn't woken up yet, and I'm not sure when he will."

Qiao Nian's eyes lit up and she heaved a long sigh of relief. Although she had already guessed that nothing would happen to Cui Qi, she was still very afraid that something would happen to him. "It's good that he's fine. It won't be long before he wakes up."

Gu Zhou didn't speak. He didn't care at all when Cui Qi woke up. His gaze fell on Qiao Nian's face and he asked curiously, "How's Madam President?"
