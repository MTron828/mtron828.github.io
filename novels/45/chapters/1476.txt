1477 Wanting to Explain

Wright drove to the address the girl named Nana had given him. It was a Western restaurant.

Wright walked over. From afar, he saw a girl in a slim silver gown sitting there.

Perhaps it was because the girl sensed his gaze, but she looked up.

When Wright saw the girl’s face, he froze.

This girl looked 90% similar to Lina. The only difference was that this girl called Nana looked more mature.

Wright walked towards Nana calmly and saw that she had already stood up.

Nana reached out to Wright, a sweet smile on her face. “Hello, Prince Wright. I’m Nana.”

Wright glanced at Nana’s hand. After some hesitation, he shook her hand.

“Prince Wright, please sit!” Nana smiled at Wright and invited him to sit down.

Wright sat in his seat and looked at Nana with a dark expression. “Tell me, why are you looking for me?”

“It’s like this, Prince Wright. I’m your junior, and my mentor is Evan. I came to look for you because of my graduation thesis.” Nana smiled, her expression calm. “My mentor said that your thesis is about the research of animal preservation, and the topic I’m doing is the research of plant preservation. My mentor wants me to learn from you.”

Wright looked at Nana in front of him without changing his expression. So it was a snack that had come knocking on his door. He would be letting himself down if he didn’t eat such a snack.

“So you’re a junior!” With a gentle smile, Wright lowered his guard.

As expected of his mentor. He knew what kind of woman he liked and even took the initiative to send her over.

“Junior, what do you want to eat today? My treat!” Wright said generously. “How can I let you treat me to a meal?”

Wright was willing to meet Nana because she looked a lot like Lina.

He was very sure that Nana had never had plastic surgery. He was very curious about who Nana was.

The most obvious difference between Nana and Lina was their eyes. Lina’s eyes were a beautiful azure blue, while Nana’s were a beautiful dark brown.

“How can that be? Senior, let me treat you to a meal. I need to learn from you. If you don’t let me treat you to a meal, I’ll be too embarrassed to learn from you,” Nana said, looking embarrassed.

In the end, it was Wright’s treat. The person who ordered the food was Nana. As this was a Chinese restaurant, Wright didn’t know which dishes tasted better.

The two of them chatted happily. This was the first time Wright had eaten century egg lean meat porridge. He even praised it happily.

The next morning, when Qiao Nian woke up, she heard a commotion outside.

She glanced around. There was no one beside her. It seemed that Gu Zhou had already woken up. She touched the empty space beside her. The mattress had already turned cold. It seemed that he had woken up a long time ago.

After Qiao Nian got out of bed, she got up and went to the bathroom. After packing up, she went downstairs. Just as she walked out of the living room, she saw Lina standing in the garden with a worried expression.

When Lina saw Qiao Nian coming over, she put away the anger on her face. With a trace of guilt in her eyes, she ran up to Qiao Nian. “Nian Nian, did I disturb you?”

Qiao Nian smiled and shook her head. “I just woke up.”

Seeing Lina’s melancholic expression, she asked with concern, “What’s wrong? Did something happen?”

When Lina heard Qiao Nian’s question, she let out a long sigh. Only then did she frown and say unhappily, “Wright is here!” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Lina pursed her lips and glanced at the entrance of the villa. “I don’t know where he got the news from, but he knew that I was with you and chased after me!”

Qiao Nian followed Lina’s gaze and saw Wright standing outside the door in a well-tailored suit.

Seeing Lina looking at him, Wright hurriedly said loudly, “Lina, this is all a misunderstanding. I hope you can listen to my explanation.”
