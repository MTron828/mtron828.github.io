929 I Want Both

“How was the exam?” Lu Jiang continued to change the topic.

“Brother, you’re changing the topic again!” Lu Qi muttered unhappily.

“When did I?”

“You did!”

… .

Lu Jiang and Lu Qi bickered all the way until they walked into a private room.

A person walked out of the darkness. It was none other than He Cheng.

There was no trace of a smile on He Cheng’s face. His eyes were filled with ruthlessness and killing intent.

He knew the girl beside Fourth Master. She should be the young lady of the Lu family.

Fourth Master was skilled and thoughtful. The success rate of him attacking Fourth Master was not very high.

However, Miss Lu was soft and weak. She was a student, and it was obvious that she was a fool and easy to bully.

Fourth Master actually dared to disrespect him. Then don’t blame him for picking on the weak!

He was the only child of the He family. No matter what he did, the He family would back him up. He was not afraid of anything! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

He had angered people in high society in the past, but so what? When those people wanted to pressure the He family, without a word, his grandmother ran to the door of that family to hang herself!

Everyone in the He family followed the principle of being shameless.

Many people were unwilling to offend the He family. After all, if something really happened to the He family at their doorstep, it would be disgusting.

Today, Fourth Master had embarrassed him!

He Cheng’s reputation was important. This time, he had been humiliated. He really couldn’t take this lying down.

Qiao Nian and Lu Qi were both beauties, but they were different types.

At the thought of two beauties serving him, He Cheng felt extremely smug.

In the private room.

Qiao Xin sat quietly on the sofa. At the thought of Qiao Nian’s words, her expression grew uglier and uglier.

Song Man was dead. If only she could kill Qiao Nian this time.

What if Gu Zhou protected Qiao Nian?

Perhaps Qiao Nian would be fine!

When the time came, shouldn’t she use the power of public opinion to bring Qiao Nian to justice?

As for Gu Zhou, she had to think of a way to clear his name. When that happened, she might have a chance to marry into the Gu family and become Mrs. Gu.

At the thought of this, Qiao Xin’s eyes were filled with laughter.

For her bright future, she had to pretend to be pitiful this time. She had to let Lu Zhu know how tragic Song Man’s death was.

Qiao Xin took out her phone and glanced at the time. There were still ten minutes before the time she agreed to meet Lu Zhu. She sat where she was, organizing her thoughts.

Suddenly, the door of the private room was pushed open.

Qiao Xin hurriedly looked up and saw Lu Zhu standing at the door of the private room. She subconsciously stood up.

Every time she saw Lu Zhu’s face, Qiao Xin’s heart would race uncontrollably. She walked over with a kind smile on her face and extended her hand to Lu Zhu. “Hello, Mr. Lu. I’m Qiao Xin!”

Lu Zhu was good-looking and was on par with Gu Zhou.

Although Qiao Xin knew that she wasn’t obsessed with looks, every time she saw someone good-looking, she couldn’t help but take a few more glances.

Lu Zhu walked in indifferently, ignoring Qiao Xin’s hand, which was about to shake his. After walking in, he stuffed a hand into his pocket and looked at Qiao Xin coldly. “Miss Qiao Xin, my time is limited. Let’s not waste time on pleasantries. Didn’t you say that you wanted to bring my sister over to acknowledge me? Where is she now?”

Qiao Xin closed the door of the private room and looked at Lu Zhu with red-rimmed eyes. She pursed her lips and said in pain, “Mr. Lu, I’m sorry. It’s all my fault!”

Lu Zhu’s face instantly darkened. “What do you mean?”

“Miss… she might not be able to make it,” Qiao Xin said in pain, her voice a little choked.

Lu Zhu exuded a cold aura. He frowned slightly and pushed up his gold-rimmed glasses. He narrowed his eyes and said in a voice like a winter blade, “Are you fooling me?”

When Lu Zhu received Qiao Xin’s call today, he knew that the eldest daughter of the Lu family Qiao Xin was talking about was Song Man. He was very curious about what else Qiao Xin knew, so he came over.

He didn’t have time to feign civility with Qiao Xin. He just wanted to end this quickly.

When Qiao Xin heard Lu Zhu’s words, she immediately stood up straight and shook her head vigorously. She said innocently, “Mr. Lu, I didn’t. I didn’t mean that. I never thought of lying to you. It was just that Eldest Miss was killed!”
