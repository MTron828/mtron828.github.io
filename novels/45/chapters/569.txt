Chapter 570: Drinking Porridge

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Seeing Gu Qi like this, Qiao Nian’s heart ached. This child was really obedient and lovable.

Qiao Nian walked out of the room and saw Gu Zhou standing by the wall with a dark expression, as if he was thinking about something.

“Is he still having a fever?” Gu Zhou asked, looking at Qiao Nian.

“His fever has already subsided. I’ve asked the servants to prepare porridge for him. I’ll get him to have some porridge later,” Qiao Nian explained when she saw Gu Zhou’s worried expression.

“That’s good.” As soon as Gu Zhou finished speaking, the phone in his pants vibrated. He took out his phone and glanced at the message. His eyes were dark as ink, and his voice was low and hoarse. “I have some things to do. Please get someone to take care of him later.”

“Okay.”

Gu Zhou left.

Gu Zhou returned to his office again and turned on his computer.

Chen Qing had already sent over all the videos of the new nanny interacting with Gu Qi. Moreover, the person who had been keeping an eye on the new nanny had also said that the new nanny was well-behaved and had no ulterior motives.

Gu Zhou no longer believed what others said. He only believed when he had seen and heard it with his own eyes and ears.

He sat in front of the computer and quickly checked on Gu Qi’s daily life.

Other than attending classes normally, Gu Qi usually stayed in his room alone to look at his phone.

Gu Zhou frowned. Gu Qi didn’t seem to have changed much from before.

Gu Zhou massaged his temples and slowly closed his eyes, his heart heavy.

… .

Qiao Nian went to the kitchen. Seeing that the servants had already prepared the porridge, she brought the pumpkin porridge to Gu Qi’s room.

Although she knew very well that Gu Qi was not her child, she still couldn’t help but want to take care of Gu Qi. She couldn’t help but want to get close to him.

Gu Qi was still staring blankly at the ceiling. Qiao Nian brought the porridge over and placed it beside Gu Qi.

“Auntie.” Seeing Qiao Nian walk over, Gu Qi retracted his gaze, his eyes flickering with a strange light.

“You can drink the porridge when it’s cooler. It’s a little hot now,” Qiao Nian said gently, looking at Gu Qi. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Gu Qi nodded obediently.

“Little Qi, don’t you want to talk to your father?” Qiao Nian recalled how Gu Zhou had just arrived. Gu Qi didn’t seem to be willing to talk to Gu Zhou. Had Gu Zhou not treated him well in the past?

When Gu Qi heard Qiao Nian’s words, he lowered his gaze in silence.

Actually, he also wanted to speak to his father, but he didn’t know what to say. In the end, he felt that it was better not to say anything.

Seeing that Gu Qi was unwilling to speak, Qiao Nian smiled and said, “Then tell Auntie whatever you want to say. I’ll try my best to help you.”

When Gu Qi heard this, he looked at Qiao Nian with sparkling eyes and nodded vigorously.

After Qiao Nian fed Gu Qi the porridge, Gu Qi fell asleep again as he was exhausted. She packed her things and walked out.

Just as she turned the corner of the stairs, she saw Gu Zhou walking up from the first floor.

Gu Zhou’s gaze lingered on Qiao Nian’s face. His gaze was dark as he said, “Get someone to take care of him tonight.”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She tactfully refused. “I’ll watch over him tonight. If he feels unwell, I’ll be the first to notice.”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he didn’t say anything. Instead, he stared at Qiao Nian, as if he didn’t agree with her at all.

Qiao Nian felt very uncomfortable under his gaze. Of course, she could sense Gu Zhou’s displeasure, but she didn’t understand why. Didn’t he care about Gu Qi a lot too?

If only Zhou Zhou were here. With just a few words, Zhou Zhou would listen obediently without any objections.

However, when Qiao Nian thought of how Zhou Zhou would be wronged at every turn, she fell silent.

“He needs someone to take care of him now.”

Gu Zhou was speechless.

“Although his fever has subsided, I don’t know if it will return. I’m a doctor. If I stay by his side, I can take care of him.”
