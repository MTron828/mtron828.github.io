Chapter 248: Substitute?

A sweet smile appeared on Gao Lin’s face. She stepped forward and took Xia Xue’s arm, trying hard to leave a good impression on Brother Cao. Perhaps one day, such a good thing would fall into her lap. She would instantly become famous.

At the thought, the smile on Gao Lin’s face grew brighter.

Brother Cao glanced at Gao Lin indifferently. Without a word, he brought the two of them into the room.

Xia Xue looked calm on the surface, but she was extremely nervous. Her palms were covered in cold sweat, and she was afraid that if she made a mistake, she would lose the opportunity to debut.

The two of them walked in. Apart from the instruments, there was no one else in the room.

Brother Cao looked at Xia Xue and pointed at the seat in the middle. “Miss Xia, please sit!”

Gao Lin gave Xia Xue an affirmative look and obediently retreated to the corner.

Hearing the coughing from the earpiece, Brother Cao said, “Miss Xia, did you practice your violin in this classroom yesterday afternoon?”

Xia Xue froze.

The violin was the last thing she was good at.

Yesterday afternoon, she seemed to have come here to practice the lute, but she had never practiced the violin.

Xia Xue’s mind raced. Suddenly, a bold conjecture occurred to her.

Could it be that someone else had practiced the violin here before she came to this classroom?

Brother Cao must have taken a liking to the girl who played the violin. However, he had accidentally found her.

The joy in Xia Xue’s eyes gradually disappeared. She lowered her gaze slightly. She had really thought that Brother Cao had taken a liking to her talent. She had never expected that she was just a substitute.

So what if she was a substitute? As long as she could seize this opportunity, she would be the one who would achieve meteoric success.

Xia Xue clenched her fists involuntarily. Her nails dug into her palms, but she didn’t seem to feel any pain.

Seeing that Xia Xue was silent, Brother Cao called out again, “Miss Xia?”

Xia Xue retracted her thoughts and smiled sweetly. She had already made her decision. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Since the heavens had given her this chance, she had to seize it firmly, even if it meant becoming someone else’s substitute.

“Yes, sir!”

Hearing Xia Xue’s words, Brother Cao heaved a sigh of relief. He had found the right person.

Mr. Dong Hua’s voice came from Brother Cao’s earpiece. “Ask her to play Missing.”

Brother Cao smiled at Xia Xue and said, “Miss Xia, the song you played yesterday, Missing, was truly amazing. I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Would you be willing to play it again today?”

Xia Xue’s palms were covered in sweat. Her heart suddenly began to race. How could she not tell that Brother Cao was testing her?

However, it was a pity that her violin skills were not good to begin with. Moreover, “Missing” was the most difficult violin song to play. When she practiced it in the past, her skills were barely satisfactory!

Could it be that someone had played this song yesterday?

Xia Xue clenched her fists tightly, the veins on the back of her hands bulging. If she pulled the wrong string, wouldn’t she be seen through?

However, at this point, she no longer had a choice.

The only thing she could do now was play the violin. If she offended Brother Cao, no matter how good her results were in the academy, it would be useless.

Xia Xue had never been so clear-headed. She looked up at Brother Cao and said guiltily, “I’m really sorry. When I got home last night, I accidentally hit my arm against the wall. My hand is very sore and uncomfortable now. Can I rest for a day or two?”

Xia Xue’s thoughts were very simple. It would only take a day or two. She could practice this piece crazily until she could play it perfectly.

“How can that be?” Brother Cao frowned. He knew that the concert would begin in two days. Time was tight. Where could he find other female musicians to save the day?
