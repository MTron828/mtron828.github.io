854 Angered to Death

Qiao Xin’s expression darkened. She just wanted to know what was going on.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Xin asked, “What method did you use to contact Nanshan Corporation?”

When Qiao Nian heard Qiao Xin’s words, she couldn’t help but laugh. She asked, “Do you really want to know? Aren’t you afraid of hurting your heart?”

Qiao Xin had a bad feeling about this. Her brow furrowed deeper and deeper. She felt that Qiao Nian’s next words would definitely not be pleasant to the ear.

Qiao Xin felt that Qiao Nian was extremely talented in cultivating Chinese herbs, but even so, Nanshan Corporation was originally in the United States. How would they know about Qiao Nian, who was in a mental hospital?

There must be something else going on.

If they could find out the connection Qiao Nian had, she and her brother would go look for that person. Perhaps they could continue to work with Nanshan Corporation.

If she could get close to that person, with her intelligence, she would quickly become a high-level executive of Nanshan Corporation.

At that time, not only could she help her brother get all kinds of projects related to the Qiao family, but she could also increase the Qiao family’s reputation in An City.

At that time, she would be able to trample on Qiao Nian.

At the thought of Qiao Nian kneeling at her feet and begging for mercy, Qiao Xin’s lips curved up slightly.

She would never allow Qiao Nian to be so arrogant in front of her.

“What’s wrong? Are you mute?” Seeing that Qiao Nian had remained silent, Qiao Xin knew that Qiao Nian definitely didn’t want her to get involved.

That made sense.

Qiao Nian must have used some dirty method to get involved, so Qiao Nian was too embarrassed to say it.

At the thought of this, the disdain in Qiao Xin’s eyes intensified.

Qiao Nian could tell from Qiao Xin’s gaze that she wasn’t up to anything good. Her eyes darted around as she said, “Actually, I still have to thank you for this!”

Hearing this, Qiao Xin’s expression changed slightly.

Why would Qiao Nian say that?

Could it be because the Qiao family had helped Qiao Nian get involved with Nanshan Corporation? That was impossible!

Neither of her parents liked Qiao Nian, but although her brother treated Qiao Nian better, he definitely wouldn’t help her. If her brother knew anyone else, he wouldn’t have discussed a collaboration with Nanshan Corporation today.

Could it be that she had inadvertently helped Qiao Nian get involved with Nanshan Corporation?

That was impossible. No one she knew was related to Nanshan Corporation.

Qiao Nian must be tricking her. She wanted to anger her on purpose before mocking her.

Qiao Xin felt that Qiao Nian was too cunning. She had to be wary of her.

“Sister, since you’ve said so, shouldn’t you give this project to my brother?” Qiao Xin wanted to see how Qiao Nian would refuse.

“I have to start from when I was young.” Seeing Qiao Xin’s surprised expression, Qiao Nian said slowly, “After Grandma left, you sent me to the mountains.”

Qiao Xin had thought that Qiao Nian was lying to her. Now that she heard Qiao Nian’s words, she was stunned.

What did Qiao Nian mean by this?

Could it really be that the Qiao family had helped Qiao Nian get in touch with the people from Nanshan Corporation?

With this thought in mind, Qiao Xin asked, “What exactly do you mean? Just say it!”

“Life in the mountains isn’t easy, but fortunately, I met an old grandpa. If Grandpa hadn’t taught me to study hard since I was young and taught me so many things, how could Qiao Nian be where she is now?”

When Qiao Xin heard Qiao Nian’s words, her expression changed.

Had Qiao Nian encountered some hidden big shot?

Wasn’t this kind of plot only seen in novels and television dramas?

Qiao Nian must be lying.

That’s right. She was a liar.

“Why don’t I understand what you’re saying? What mountain? What grandfather? Do you think you’re filming a television drama or writing a novel?” Qiao Xin clenched her fists tightly, her nails digging into her palms. Even though her palms were already bleeding, she didn’t seem to feel anything.

However, the fear and unease in Qiao Xin’s eyes revealed her true feelings.

“He was a big shot, but because he was getting old, he didn’t want to tire himself out anymore, so he lived in seclusion in the mountains and forests. At that time, I accidentally bumped into him. He thought that I was very smart and wanted me to inherit his estate, so I became the principal of An University and even worked at Nanshan Corporation!” The smile on Qiao Nian’s face grew brighter and brighter as she spoke gently to Qiao Xin.
