Just as Chen Qing was about to leave, he suddenly seemed to have thought of something. He looked at Gu Zhou and was about to speak when he saw Gu Zhou give him a look. He immediately fell silent and walked out.

Qiao Nian didn’t notice the interaction between Gu Zhou and Chen Qing. She looked up at Gu Zhou and said seriously, “I need a medical laboratory. When Chen Qing returns from Bear Mountain, ask him to give me the arrow. For the next ten hours, don’t let anyone disturb Lina and me. Other than Dr. Ollie, no other doctors are allowed to enter Lina’s ward.”

When Gu Zhou heard this, he nodded. Then, he took out his phone and made a call.

The call went through very quickly.

Gu Zhou said, “Yes, I’ll borrow your laboratory for about a day.”

“Alright, I understand.”

With that, Gu Zhou hung up. He looked up at Qiao Nian and said, “It’s done.”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in front of her, her lips curving up slightly. Her heart was already rippling. She walked over to Gu Zhou and stood on her tiptoes to kiss him on the cheek. She said softly, “Then I’ll go over first.”

With that, Qiao Nian turned to leave, but Gu Zhou grabbed her hand.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou with a smile.

Gu Zhou tucked Qiao Nian’s hair behind her ear and said in a low voice, “Don’t be too tired.”

“Don’t worry.” Qiao Nian smiled, her eyes filled with stars. “I’ll be fine.”

Only then did Gu Zhou let go of Qiao Nian’s hand and say, “Then go.”

Gu Zhou called and arranged for someone to send Qiao Nian to the laboratory.

Qiao Nian had just left when Gu Zhou’s phone rang. He glanced at the caller ID and saw that it was Chen Qing calling. He placed the phone to his ear and asked in a low voice, “What happened?”

“Doctor Kate, who removed the silver needles from the Seventh Princess’s body, is already under surveillance. Her phone is also with us. I realized that she has already called Prince Wright.”

Gu Zhou frowned. He had thought that this was just a matter of medical skills. He did not expect Kate to be colluding with Prince Wright.

Prince Wright was guarding outside. He probably wanted to take Lina away from them.

Gu Zhou’s gaze turned sharp. If Prince Wright couldn’t wait any longer, he might contact the president. When that happened, the consequences would be very serious.

Nian’er would need ten hours. As long as she had ten hours, she could save Lina.

Gu Zhou’s expression grew more and more serious. They had already found out that the kidnapping more than twenty years ago was related to the European President. Only by getting close to Lina would the European President be unguarded against them. Only then could they investigate the kidnapping twenty years ago.

Seeing that Gu Zhou was silent, Chen Qing asked tentatively, “Second Young Master, what should we do now? Should we hand the Seventh Princess over to Wright?”

As the saying went, a strong dragon could not suppress a local snake. After all, this was Europe’s territory. If the president misunderstood that they wanted to attack the Seventh Princess, the situation would be very bad.

After saying that, Chen Qing regretted it. Whether he handed the Seventh Princess over to the President or to Wright, it made no difference. The Seventh Princess would still be taken away by Wright in the end. Then, Wright’s scheme would be completed.

Then the Seventh Princess…

At the thought of this, Chen Qing frowned. The Seventh Princess would still be schemed against in the end. If the Seventh Princess woke up and found out the truth, how sad would she be? Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Gu Zhou’s eyes were like a pool of ice. He gripped his cell phone tightly and was silent for a while before saying firmly, “There’s no need. Send the arrow to the laboratory when you get it. I’ll send you the address.”

When Chen Qing heard Gu Zhou’s words, he heaved a sigh of relief and agreed. “Okay.”

After Chen Qing hung up, he stepped on the accelerator. Time waited for no man. He had to get the arrow as soon as possible and rush to the laboratory Second Young Master had mentioned.

At the same time, Wright, who had been guarding the hospital door, could no longer sit still.

He slammed the glass of red wine on the table at the side and looked at the hospital not far away with a dark expression. He said coldly, “Where’s Kate? Why haven’t I heard from her at all? Did you call her?”
