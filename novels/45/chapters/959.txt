Seeing that Qiao Nian was frowning, Gu Zhou asked worriedly, “I’ll find a hospital nearby. I’ll send you there.”

Qiao Nian was speechless.

“There’s no need to go to the hospital,” Qiao Nian hurriedly said. If she went to the hospital, Gu Zhou would realize that she was pretending to have a stomachache. She said shyly, “I’ll just go to the bathroom. It’s not a big deal!”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he didn’t say anything and stopped the car.

“Wait for me here. I’ll go myself.” Without waiting for Gu Zhou to speak, Qiao Nian got out of the car and left.

Gu Zhou parked the car at the same spot. This was a food street, and the toilets in the food street were all in the alley. Through the rearview mirror, he watched Qiao Nian walk into the alley. He wanted to follow her, but he thought that Qiao Nian might feel embarrassed, so he didn’t.

Qiao Nian shook Gu Zhou off and jogged towards Boss Li’s spicy duck neck shop.

Boss Li’s attitude was really too strange. She wanted to ask what had happened.

Boss Li was working in the shop. When he saw Qiao Nian enter, an honest smile appeared on his face. He hurriedly went up to her and asked, “Mrs. Gu, what else do you want to buy?”

Qiao Nian smiled, then shook her head and asked, “Boss, I just don’t understand something. I want to ask you something.”

Boss Li smiled at Qiao Nian and said gently, “Mrs. Gu, please speak!”

Before Qiao Nian came, she had already asked the surrounding vendors. She knew that Boss Li’s shop had been closed for a period of time.

When Boss Li heard Qiao Nian’s words, he immediately looked sad. He sighed and said, “Something happened at home during that period of time. I had no choice but to close the shop.”

“What happened?” Qiao Nian asked worriedly.

“Sigh, my wife is seriously ill. I wanted to stay in the hospital with her, but the medical fees were really too expensive. I even wanted to sell the shop.” At this point, Boss Li looked up at Qiao Nian. “If Mr. Gu hadn’t helped, my wife might have left us… Sigh…”

Boss Li’s eyes turned red. He blinked, trying hard to suppress his tears.

Qiao Nian asked worriedly, “What’s wrong with the lady boss?”

From Boss Li’s voice, one could tell how helpless he had been.

No poor person could afford to be sick.

“The second stage of breast cancer. The doctor said that this illness can be cured, but it will require a huge medical fee.” Boss Li sighed sadly and said sadly, “How can ordinary families like us have so much money? Even if my shop is sold, it might not be enough.”

Qiao Nian’s heart jumped to her throat. She could especially understand what Boss Li was saying. Back then, when she was thrown to the countryside, she had been so helpless.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Boss Li sniffled and smiled brightly. “Fortunately, Mr. Gu helped us pay for my wife’s medical fees, so my wife could undergo surgery smoothly and escape danger. He even paid to help me reopen the shop. Without Mr. Gu, our family might have been gone. Mr. Gu is our hope for the future…”

When Qiao Nian heard Boss Li’s words, she was slightly stunned. Puzzled, she asked, “How does he know about your family’s situation?”

In Qiao Nian’s opinion, Gu Zhou rarely went out. Even when he did, he mostly went to important places.

Moreover, Gu Zhou did not have much interaction with Boss Li. How could he know about Boss Li’s family situation? Why would he help Boss Li solve his problems?

Gu Zhou was a businessman. Businessmen pursued profits and would not make a loss.

Boss Li seemed to see the surprise in Qiao Nian’s eyes. His expression changed slightly, and his eyes were filled with gratitude. He said gratefully, “Mrs. Gu, speaking of which, this matter is actually related to you.”

“Me?” Qiao Nian’s eyes were filled with surprise.

“That’s right. Back then, Mr. Gu wanted me to continue opening this spicy duck neck shop. He even said that his wife especially liked to eat spicy duck neck, so he hoped that I could settle the family matters as soon as possible and open the shop!” Boss Li said with a smile.
