“What should we do? Someone’s coming!” Zhao Qian was at her wits’ end. Although she had meant no harm, if others found out that Miss Shen Xing was fooling around with a man in public, Shen Xing would definitely bear a grudge against her. So would the entire Shen family.

A trace of panic flashed in Qiao Xin’s eyes. She had initially thought that Qiao Nian would also be present, but contrary to her expectations, there was only Shen Xing, together with a wretched man. This was terrible. If Matriarch Shen knew that Qiao Xin had caused Shen Xing to ruin her purity in front of everyone, then the Qiao family…

This wouldn’t do. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

She could not allow the Qiao family to fall into danger.

Seeing a socialite taking out her phone to record the scene, Qiao Xin seemed to have thought of something. She turned to leave, but saw Qiao Nian looking at her meaningfully from not far away.

Qiao Xin quickly looked away, not daring to meet Qiao Nian’s eyes. Slowly, she pressed her slender fingers to her temple and collapsed to the ground weakly, pretending to faint.

Zhao Qian had wanted to ask Qiao Xin for help. Seeing Qiao Xin faint, she hurriedly shouted, “Qiao Xin! Qiao Xin, what’s wrong? Wake up!”

When the socialite heard Zhao Qian’s words, she turned to look at Qiao Xin, who was now lying on the ground. Just as she was about to speak, a servant hurried over.

“What happened?” Butler Shen looked at Qiao Xin, lying prone on the ground. Just as he finished speaking, he heard the sound of making love from not far away. He looked over and saw his family’s Third Young Mistress sitting naked on a man, bouncing up and down.

“Miss!” At this moment, Butler Shen had no time to pay any attention to the person lying on the ground. He quickly ran toward the two people locked in an embrace on the lawn. When he saw that his family’s Young Mistress was completely naked, his expression instantly soured. He immediately took off his suit jacket, draping it on Shen Xing’s body.

“Go away!” Shen Xing was already wholly under the control of the lust drug. She pushed away Butler Shen, who was trying to pull her off the man, and flung away the suit jacket. She then threw herself onto the man in excitement.

Butler Shen had no choice but to knock Shen Xing out and forcibly take her away.

“What’s going on here?” Along with many others, Matriarch Shen rushed to the scene. When she saw Shen Xing in Butler Shen’s arms, her gaze landed on Shen Xing’s bare legs. In that instant, she understood everything. She shouted sternly, “Butler, what’s going on?”

Matriarch Shen was known for being strict with her children. However, on this special day, her granddaughter actually had sex in front of everyone. How could she tolerate this!

Matriarch Shen gripped her walking stick tightly. In order to protect the Shen family’s reputation, she could only let Shen Xing suffer.

“Wake her up!” Matriarch Shen pointed at Shen Xing and said furiously, “And that man, bring him over!”

Butler Shen splashed pool water on Shen Xing, waking her up from her coma. He then tied the man up and threw him in front of Matriarch Shen.

“Ah!” When Shen Xing woke up, she discovered that she was only wearing a suit jacket. The suit jacket barely covered her thighs. If she moved slightly, she would be exposed in public.

She clutched at the jacket in a panic, her face red with embarrassment and fear. Shivering, she curled in on herself. Everything that had just happened replayed in her mind.

It was over!

It was all over!

Shen Xing drew a cold breath. How could she be so desperately eager to be with a man like Ah San?

No, she couldn’t possibly be so wanton.

Shen Xing suddenly remembered that Qiao Nian had sprinkled some powder on her earlier. Her eyes lit up and she immediately shouted, “Grandma, please save me! I’ve fallen into someone’s trap!”

When the onlookers heard Shen Xing’s words, they all expressed their disbelief. One by one, they began to mutter softly.

“I didn’t expect Young Mistress Shen to be so uninhibited.”

“Who knew? Young Mistress Shen’s amorousness has truly broadened my horizons!”

“I heard that it was Young Mistress Shen who pounced on the servant. That poor servant. He might lose his job because of Miss Shen.”

…

Matriarch Shen had already thought of how to punish Shen Xing. However, when she heard Shen Xing’s words, her eyes flickered.

Ever since she was a child, Shen Xing had grown up by Matriarch Shen’s side. Although Shen Xing was arrogant and willful, she would never do such an outrageous thing.

“Tell me, what really happened?” Hearing the discussion of the surrounding onlookers, Matriarch Shen spoke sternly, her eyes as cold as ice.

Qiao Nian stepped in slowly from the other side. She looked at Qiao Xin, who was still lying on the ground, and casually stepped on Qiao Xin’s hand. Seeing that Qiao Xin remained unmoving, she stepped again on the back of Qiao Xin’s hand, her expression blank. Qiao Nian thought to herself, “Let’s see who’s better at acting!”

“Grandma, you have to uphold justice for me!” With tears running down her face, Shen Xing pointed at Qiao Nian in the crowd, shouting loudly. “It’s Qiao Nian! She’s the one who wants to harm me!”

Matriarch Gu was standing beside Matriarch Shen. At Shen Xing’s words, her expression immediately soured.. Without waiting for Matriarch Shen to speak, she said, “Miss Shen, you have to take responsibility for your words. My granddaughter-in-law would never do something so despicable!”
