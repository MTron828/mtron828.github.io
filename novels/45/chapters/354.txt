Chapter 355: My Head Hurts

“Yes,” Li Kun replied indifferently.

Qin Dong’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian. Qiao Nian’s posture was elegant, and her temperament was noble. No matter how one looked at her, she was an obedient child.

With this thought in mind, Qin Dong nodded and said, “I believe in your judgment of people. Since she can catch your eye, she must be a good person. After the banquet, I’ll discuss it with your father. When the time comes, we’ll go to the Qiao family to propose marriage!”

When Li Kun heard Qin Dong’s words, he hurriedly said, “Mom, there’s no hurry. I can handle this myself.”

When Qin Dong heard Li Kun’s words, a faint smile appeared on her lips. It seemed that her son really cared about this girl. Hence, she smiled and said, “Okay.”

Gu Zhou was not far from Qin Dong and Li Kun. He had heard everything the mother and son said. His eyes darkened as he stood there coldly.

In just a few seconds, Qiao Nian walked over. She walked past Gu Zhou and was about to walk forward when she heard Gu Zhou say, “Doctor Qiao, I have a headache!”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she instantly grew nervous. She quickly walked over to Gu Zhou and grabbed his hand, hurriedly taking his pulse.

Frowning slightly, Qiao Nian asked, “Why do you suddenly have a headache? Are you feeling unwell?”

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian’s actions attracted the attention of everyone around them, especially Jiang Yue.

Jiang Yue frowned.

Brother Gu Zhou clearly hated women the most, and he didn’t like to have physical contact with any woman, but Brother Gu Zhou acted very normally in front of Qiao Nian.

Jiang Yue’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s hand, which was holding onto Gu Zhou’s. She bit her lip, a trace of pain flashing in her eyes.

The two of them seemed to have a tacit understanding. Their movements were so familiar and natural.

Qin Lu, who was standing at the side, gritted his teeth in anger. He wished he could cut off Qiao Nian’s hand.

Li Kun looked at Qiao Nian with admiration.

Everyone knew that Gu Zhou’s illness was serious, but under such circumstances, Qiao Nian was still willing to treat Gu Zhou. This was enough to prove that Qiao Nian was confident. Moreover, she was a bold and meticulous person. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Qiao Nian’s brow furrowed deeper and deeper. A trace of worry flashed in her eyes. She had taken Gu Zhou’s pulse several times, but she felt that it was normal. There was nothing wrong with it.

Qiao Nian raised her hand and glanced at Gu Zhou’s forehead. After confirming that he didn’t have a fever, she looked into Gu Zhou’s eyes and asked with concern, “Does it still hurt?”

Inadvertently, Qiao Nian met Gu Zhou’s deep eyes. She felt as if her soul was being sucked in.

Qiao Nian’s breathing quickened.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian with a burning gaze. His voice was hoarse. “It doesn’t hurt anymore.”

Qiao Nian hurriedly retracted her hand. She felt that Gu Zhou’s gaze was a little too hot. She avoided his gaze and said, “As long as it doesn’t hurt.”

For some reason, she felt that Gu Zhou was a little strange today.

Qin Lu, who was standing at the side, watched as Qiao Nian touched Gu Zhou’s hand. Then, he saw Qiao Nian stroke Gu Zhou’s forehead. In a rage, he cursed softly, “This is immoral. A young lady touching a man’s body. How shameless!”

When Jiang Yue heard Qin Lu’s words, she glanced at him indifferently. She didn’t speak, but the look in her eyes wasn’t good either.

Qiao Nian retracted her hand as well. However, she was worried that Gu Zhou would have a relapse again, so she stood beside him.

“Brother.”

A gentle voice rang out.

Everyone turned to look. Their eyes instantly lit up. They were all stunned.

It was Song Yu.

Song Yu’s soft hair fell over her shoulders. When she walked, her steps were like a waterfall. The confidence she exuded made everyone look at her.

She was wearing a white gown. Under the light, she seemed to be enveloped in a layer of soft light, as if she was a fairy who had descended from the sky.
