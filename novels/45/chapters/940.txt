941 I Don’t Know Where I Went Wrong

“Yes, if Song Man was the eldest daughter of the Lu family, she should have returned to the Lu family directly, not meet the Lu family through Qiao Xin.” As Qiao Yu spoke, he looked at Qiao Xin sharply and continued, “You thought that Song Man was the eldest daughter of the Lu family. You thought that you had already joined forces with Song Man, which was why you met with Qiao Nian last night. You didn’t expect to fail.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

At this point, the problem that had been bothering Qiao Yu was instantly resolved. He continued, “If I’m not wrong, the real eldest daughter of the Lu family is Qiao Nian. Lu Zhu shot you because of what you did to Qiao Nian!”

After Qiao Yu finished speaking, the room was so quiet that one could hear a pin drop.

Su Xue looked at Qiao Yu in disbelief and asked, “W-What did you say? Qiao Nian was the young miss of the Lu family. How is that possible?”

Qiao Shan couldn’t believe Qiao Yu’s words either. He looked at Qiao Yu in surprise.

Qiao Xin stared at Qiao Yu in shock. She had never expected her brother to guess everything correctly after just a few words.

Was this the difference between a genius and an ordinary person?

Seeing Qiao Xin’s shocked expression, Qiao Yu asked, “What did I say wrong?”

Qiao Xin pursed her lips and shook her head. Reluctantly, she said, “I only found out later from Lu Zhu that Song Man’s blood is the same as Qiao Nian’s. If I’m not wrong, Song Man must have had a bone marrow transplant from Qiao Nian. The real eldest daughter of the Lu family is Qiao Nian!”

Su Xue staggered. If she hadn’t been holding onto the bed, she would have fallen.

With that, Qiao Xin’s gaze fell on Su Xue’s face. She said excitedly, “Mom, you told me before that she’s just an unwanted young lady born to a rich businessman’s lover. How can she be a member of the Lu family, and the enviable eldest daughter of the Lu family?”

The blood drained from Su Xue’s face.

She didn’t know what was going on either.

The kidnapping of the eldest daughter of the Lu family more than twenty years ago had spread like wildfire. Everyone knew that the eldest daughter of the Lu family was dead and that the kidnappers had killed her.

Qiao Shan was also shocked. He frowned at Su Xue, as if this was the first time he had seen his ex-wife. He asked, “At this point, you should tell the truth. Where exactly did you pick Qiao Nian up from?”

Qiao Yu’s gaze fell on Su Xue’s pale face. He had a bad feeling.

Su Xue’s eyes instantly turned red. If what happened more than twenty years ago was discovered, she would never be able to get back together with Qiao Shan again.

Last time, Qiao Shan had already suspected her. At that time, she had only managed to fool him, but Qiao Shan had still given her a good beating.

If Qiao Shan knew that she had already cheated on him more than twenty years ago and even embezzled the company’s funds, he would definitely want to tear her to pieces.

“When I lived in my hometown, Soul City, I didn’t know about the kidnapping of the eldest daughter of the Lu family either. However, she was wearing tattered clothes, and she was injured. Her brain wasn’t working well either, so she grabbed me and called me Mom. At that time, I saw that there was a million yuan in adoption fees. In addition, the feng shui master had once said that Qiao Yu wasn’t in good health and needed us to do more good deeds. Therefore, I thought that adopting a child was a good thing, so I brought her home,” Su Xue said helplessly, frowning.

When Qiao Yu heard Su Xue’s words, he frowned and asked, “What one million?”

Qiao Shan knew about this, so he said, “When Qiao Nian arrived at our house when she was young, she was carrying a small school bag. Inside the school bag was a cheque for a million yuan. At that time, Qiao Nian really didn’t remember anything. She only said that her name was ‘Nian’er’, so we named her Qiao Nian!”

When Qiao Yu heard Qiao Shan’s words, he was stunned. After a while, he smiled coldly and said sarcastically, “I thought that Mom and Dad were both kind people who were willing to adopt a young lady. After Grandma left, you threw her into the mountains to fend for herself. At that time, I thought you were selfish. You casually adopted a child and left her behind. Six years ago, you even let Qiao Xin bully her like that. You’re really good parents!”

Qiao Shan and Su Xue’s faces turned pale with shame.
