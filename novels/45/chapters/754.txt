755 Taking Care of Mommy

As they were similar in age, they had many common topics to talk about. Gradually, they became good friends.

She lived in Hai Cheng when she was young. It was close to the sea, and the tourism industry was more developed.

However, he heard from Xiao Shi that because her mother was sick, she had to go out to work to earn money to treat her mother’s illness.

Due to her young age, outsiders often bullied her and deducted her salary.

However, he heard from Xiao Shi that because her mother was sick, she had to go out to work to earn money to treat her mother’s illness.

When she was young, she even said that her mother had a child out of wedlock. She received disdain from everyone and was despised by the neighbors nearby.

When she was young, her greatest dream was to leave Hai Cheng with her mother in the future so that her mother could live an easy and happy life.

At the thought that he would be meeting Xiao Shi soon, Gu Qi couldn’t help but feel excited.

At this moment, in Hai Cheng.

Hai Cheng was a city with a large gap between the rich and the poor. The rich were extremely rich, and the poor lived in the slums and worried about food every day.

A young lady with a low ponytail was squatting on the ground, adding firewood to the stove. Her clothes had been washed until they were a little white. This dress had been given to her by her neighbor.

After a long time, the young lady heard the sound of the Chinese medicine in the medicine jar boiling. Only then did she carefully pour the medicine into a bowl.

Carefully, she carried the freshly brewed Chinese medicine towards the bedroom.

Before she reached the bedroom door, a woman coughed. She frowned slightly and quickly walked in.

When the woman sitting in the room heard footsteps, she hurriedly suppressed her coughing and tidied her hair briefly, revealing a pale and beautiful face.

She was only twenty-five years old, but she was extremely beautiful.

She had a fragile beauty, as if she were an exquisite doll that no one dared to touch.

The only bad thing was that she was missing her left arm.

Xiao Shi walked to the bed with the medicine and said softly, “Mommy, the medicine is ready. After you drink it, you’ll be fine!”

Song Man tried her best to smile lightly. She looked at Xiao Shi, who had walked up to her.

It had been five years.

When she was young, her eyebrows gradually grew, and she looked more and more like that person.

Her fox-like eyes were slightly smiling, and under her small nose was a small cherry-like mouth. She looked exquisite, like a cute doll in a merchandise shop. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Even though she was wearing old clothes, it couldn’t hide her noble aura at all.

Her aura was incompatible with this slum.

Song Man was slightly dazed.

Xiao Shi smiled and reminded her, “Mommy, drink the medicine while it’s hot.”

When Song Man heard Xiao Shi’s words, she took the medicine from her guiltily. Her eyes instantly turned red as she said, “I’m sorry, Xiao Shi. Mommy was incompetent. Mommy…”

“Mommy.” Xiao Shi frowned unhappily and said seriously, “Xiao Shi is no longer a child. Xiao Shi can take good care of Mommy!”

“If Mommy had been in good health, you wouldn’t have to work so hard when you are young. Mommy has been a burden to you.” As Song Man spoke, her eyes grew redder and redder, and tears welled up in her eyes.

When Xiaohou heard Song Man’s words, she took a deep breath and said, “Mommy, I’m already a grown up. I can earn a lot of money. Tomorrow, we’ll go to An City to look for Grandpa. Grandpa and Grandma will definitely be very happy to see you. Then, Mommy’s illness will recover!”

“But…”

“Mommy, take your time drinking the medicine. I’ll go cook.” With that, Xiao Shi walked out.

Song Man watched as Xiao Shi left. When Xiao Shi disappeared from the door, the guilt on her face instantly disappeared, replaced by coldness.

She stood up, her lips curving up in a mocking smile. She walked to the window and poured the medicinal soup out of the bowl.

His eyes were as cold as ice, and his lips were filled with disdain.

Great.

She could finally leave this place.

Her good days were yet to come!
