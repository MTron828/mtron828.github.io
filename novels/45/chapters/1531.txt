1532 Secret

The entire corridor turned cold and suffocating.

After an unknown period of time, Ollie felt the pressure from the president disappear. He heaved a sigh of relief.

Still frowning, the president said reluctantly, “Come with me.”

“Yes,” Ollie agreed eagerly.

The president led Ollie towards the study. He knew in his heart that Qiao Nian’s medical skills were good. If Qiao Nian found out that Madam had undergone plastic surgery, she might discover what had happened more than twenty years ago.

He didn’t want Qiao Nian to know about the past.

As Ollie wiped the sweat from his forehead, he followed the president. He was extremely puzzled. What exactly was the president trying to hide? If he saw it, wouldn’t he be the one who knew the president’s secrets?

If the president’s secret was leaked, wouldn’t he become the president’s suspect?

…

No wonder the president had taken a long time to consider this before making up his mind. He was probably wondering if he was reliable.

Ollie pursed his lips. How stupid of him. He hadn’t thought too much about it just now, but it was too late to say anything now.

When they arrived at the President’s office, the President gestured for Ollie to close the door.

After Ollie closed the door, he stood rooted to the ground uneasily.

The president took the information off the shelf and handed it to Ollie.

Ollie took the documents and looked at the treatment forms. His pupils dilated uncontrollably, and his hands trembled slightly, sweat rolling down his face. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Ollie looked at the president in shock.

The president’s expression was normal, but his voice was gloomy. He asked, “Can you do it?”

Ollie’s mind was in a mess. He really did not want to take on this kind of job, but he had no choice. He could only suppress all kinds of uneasiness in his heart and nod. His voice was a little shaky as he said frivolously, “Okay.”

The president sat at the side and watched as Ollie sorted out Shen Mei’s medical records.

Ollie didn’t understand why the president was doing this. Was he hiding something?

After a long time, Ollie handed the medical records to the president. His voice was a little light and trembling. “Mr. President, it’s all been sorted out.”

The president took the diagnosis and treatment form from Ollie. He took a closer look. The surgical diagnosis and treatment forms he wanted to hide had all been removed, and the remaining ones were insignificant. He still looked at Ollie worriedly and asked, “Are you sure this is fine?”

Ollie was drenched in cold sweat. He really couldn’t guarantee it, but there was nothing else he could do now. He could only nod and agree. “I think so. I’ll ask Doctor Qiao tentatively and see why she wants to know this.”

The President looked down at the medical records in his hand and narrowed his eyes.

Too many things had happened recently. He was in a terrible mood and couldn’t relax at all.

Although he felt that Qiao Nian would help him treat Madam, he didn’t understand why Qiao Nian wanted the medical records.

Qiao Nian was from An City, so he couldn’t trust her completely.

If that matter was exposed, there might be a lot of trouble. He didn’t dare to take the risk.

The president sighed slightly and took another careful look at the list in his hand. His gaze said, “Yes.”

Ollie nodded and hurriedly retreated from the study. It wasn’t until he was outside that he felt relieved. He had really been frightened to death just now.

The president looked at the list in his hand. After confirming that there was nothing wrong, he took the list and walked out.

…

Qiao Nian smiled at the waking Madam President and asked gently, “Madam, what do you think?”

Madam President had been lying on her stomach. When she heard Qiao Nian’s voice, she subconsciously hid inside. When she came back to her senses, she looked at Qiao Nian.

The way she looked at Qiao Nian was filled with unfamiliarity, as if she was thinking about who Qiao Nian was.

Qiao Nian smiled at Madam President. She wasn’t in a hurry to speak. Instead, she waited for Madam President to think for herself.

Shen Mei looked at Qiao Nian’s face. She seemed to have seen it somewhere before. Suddenly, an idea flashed across her mind. She came back to her senses and pulled the blanket over her shyly, giving a grateful smile. “Yes!”
