Gu Zhou liked her. How was that possible?

The two of them were just together for the time being.

If Gu Zhou really liked her, how could he have lived separately from her?

Of course, she had never thought of living with Gu Zhou.

She just felt that it was impossible for Gu Zhou to like her.

But why would Little Qi say such a thing for no reason?

“Auntie Nian Nian, do you like Dad?” Gu Qi asked again, unwilling to give up.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Gu Qi’s face. Gu Qi was looking at her seriously, as if he was looking forward to her answer.

She smiled and reached out to stroke Gu Qi’s head. “Why would you ask that?”

“Does Auntie Nian Nian not like Dad?” Gu Qi looked at Qiao Nian seriously and continued, “You didn’t even want to look at Dad just now.”

“Is that so?” Qiao Nian looked at Gu Qi in confusion and asked curiously.

“Yes, it’s especially obvious.” As Gu Qi spoke, he moved closer to Qiao Nian and said seriously, “Auntie Nian Nian, Dad likes you very much. Do you really not like him at all?”

For a moment, Qiao Nian was at a loss for words.

She had been a fool to have suspected that Gu Qi was naturally autistic.

Listen to Gu Qi’s words.

There was nothing wrong with his logic. He kept asking her questions, as if he had to get answers from her.

“Actually, Auntie is just a little too surprised. I’ve never thought about my relationship with your father in the past, but you shouldn’t say this in front of him, understand?” Qiao Nian said gently, hoping to end this topic as soon as possible.

However, Gu Qi was still frowning. He looked at Qiao Nian in surprise and said in confusion, “Auntie Nian Nian, Dad told me himself that he likes you. I’m not spouting nonsense.”

“This doesn’t seem like something he would say,” Qiao Nian said uncertainly.

“Dad just told me!” Gu Qi nodded seriously.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Qi’s serious face, the confusion in her eyes growing more obvious.

In her opinion, Gu Qi didn’t seem like a child who would lie.

Why would Gu Zhou say that?

She suddenly recalled that she had told Gu Zhou that she wanted to hide the fact that they were married because she was worried that Gu Qi would not be able to accept it.

Did Gu Zhou say that he liked her now because he wanted Gu Qi to slowly accept that they were already married?

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian’s frown gradually relaxed.

“Auntie, do you like my father or not?” Gu Qi asked impatiently. Qiao Nian had never told him anything definite.

A faint smile appeared on Qiao Nian’s face. She tapped her nose lightly and said, “You’re still a child. Don’t think about these things now.”

Gu Qi nodded in disappointment. He had to be a good child. He couldn’t let Auntie Nian Nian get angry.

“Little Qi, let me tell you something. Auntie asked Auntie Su to meet you today mainly because she wanted her to…”

“Auntie Nian Nian, you don’t have to say anything else. I’ve already understood!” Gu Qi said seriously, a bright smile on his face.

“I’m really sorry. I’m sorry!”

Gu Qi held Qiao Nian’s hand with both hands and shook his head. “Auntie Nian Nian, I know you’re doing this for my own good. I don’t blame you!”

Hearing Gu Qi’s words, Qiao Nian’s heart warmed. Her heart ached for Gu Qi even more.

This child was really too sensible. He was so sensible that it made one’s heart ache. One would think that he was no longer a child.

Children of Gu Qi’s age were mostly mischievous and willful. They even liked to disagree with their parents.

If only Gu Qi could be like those children. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Alright, you can rest now!” Qiao Nian helped Gu Qi lie down on the bed and covered him with the blanket. She lowered her head slightly and kissed Gu Qi on the forehead.

“Okay.” Gu Qi nodded obediently, watching Qiao Nian leave without blinking.

After Qiao Nian left, the relaxed and happy expression on Gu Qi’s face gradually disappeared. He lifted the blanket and got out of bed. Wearing slippers, he squatted by the curtains in the corner again and covered himself with the curtains.

He hugged his knees tightly. He had told his father that he wanted his mother to live with Auntie Nian Nian.

However, he was a little worried. Would Mommy be sad if she knew that Daddy didn’t like her?

How could he make Mommy not feel sad?

Why not let Mommy and Auntie Nian Nian get married?

Gu Qi frowned again. He didn’t know if Mommy and Auntie Nian Nian would agree.
