Chapter 555: Third Party

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Whether Qiao Nian believed her or not, the words she had said today would stab into Qiao Nian’s heart like a thorn. Moreover, Qiao Nian would definitely think of a way to investigate.

If Qiao Nian found out that Gu Zhou really had an illegitimate child, she would definitely not be able to accept it. She would definitely leave the Gu family.

When that happened, she would be able to return to the Gu family in glory and make it up to Grandma.

At the thought of this, Jiang Yue walked up to Qiao Nian in her high heels and said sarcastically, “Let me tell you, what Grandma cares about the most is her great-grandson, who is related to her by blood. As for you, you’re just here as a lucky replacement. When the mother of that child comes back, you’ll be the third party!”

Seeing the smile on Jiang Yue’s face, a trace of displeasure flashed across Qiao Nian’s face. She raised her hand.

Bam!

Qiao Nian slapped Jiang Yue hard across the face.

Jiang Yue covered her face in shock. Her eyes widened as she stared at Qiao Nian in disbelief.

Ever since she was young, no one had dared to hit her.

Even when she angered Grandma when she was young, Grandma couldn’t bear to hit her.

Qiao Nian, this country bumpkin, actually dared to hit her. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

In the past, when she was still in the Gu family, Qiao Nian didn’t even dare to let out a fart. Now that she had left the Gu family, Qiao Nian was acting so brazenly?

Qiao Nian looked down at her right hand and gently blew on her palm that hurt. She looked down at Jiang Yue and said coldly, “I slapped you on behalf of Grandma. It’s been so long, but you still don’t understand Grandma’s good intentions. Do you honestly think that Grandma only cares about blood ties?! Grandma has been good to you for so many years for nothing. That’s right, you don’t understand how good she is to you at all. You didn’t even appreciate it. You’re not even worthy of calling her Grandma now!”

There was a clear handprint on Jiang Yue’s fair cheek.

When Jiang Yue saw the anger in Qiao Nian’s eyes, the anger on her face gradually disappeared. Her lips curved up slowly, looking smug.

Qiao Nian made her move.

This also meant that Qiao Nian already believed her words. It seemed that this slap wasn’t a loss.

Right now, she wanted Qiao Nian, who was standing on a cloud, to fall from the sky. She wanted Qiao Nian, who had just been doted on, to be chased out. She wanted her to experience endless despair.

At the thought of this, the smile on Jiang Yue’s face grew brighter. She said, “Qiao Nian, let’s see who will have the last laugh. I hope you can still be as arrogant as you are today!”

With that, Jiang Yue left. She was in a good mood.

Qiao Nian watched as Jiang Yue left. Although she didn’t believe Jiang Yue’s words, she was still a little puzzled.

Jiang Yue was completely different from Qiao Xin. Qiao Xin was an idiot who did whatever she wanted. However, Jiang Yue was different. She was intelligent. Once she had made up her mind about something, she would work hard to complete it.

For example, Jiang Yue had tried to use her to kill Matriarch Gu.

Then what was Jiang Yue planning this time?

Qiao Nian walked out quickly. When she bumped into the butler, she stopped him.

“Second Young Madam,” the butler said respectfully.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on the entrance of the Gu family villa. Puzzled, she asked, “Why did Jiang Yue come in?”

Actually, the butler had only just discovered Jiang Yue’s presence. He sighed helplessly and said, “Second Young Madam, Jiang Yue has lived here for more than ten years. Some of the servants have a deep relationship with her. Moreover, the news of what happened that night hasn’t spread. No one knows what happened, so they didn’t stop her!”

Qiao Nian’s eyes instantly turned cold. She said, “From now on, no one is allowed to let Jiang Yue in. If anyone lets her in again, he can find another job!”
