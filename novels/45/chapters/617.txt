Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou and frowned, her expression sincere. “I’m telling the truth. Little Qi really knows how to write. After he asked me out and returned my money, I gave him the IOU. At that time, he even put it in his bag. I don’t know if it’s missing or not. If you don’t believe me, there’s nothing I can do.”

At this point, Qiao Nian glanced at the photo in her hand and couldn’t help but sigh. “At that time, I thought he was especially cute. This IOU is also very cute. That’s why I took a photo as a memento.”

“It’s not that I don’t believe you.” Gu Zhou’s eyes darkened, a trace of sorrow in them.

Qiao Nian looked into Gu Zhou’s eyes and was slightly stunned. She suddenly recalled that Gu Qi seemed to pretend to be autistic in front of Gu Zhou. He was unwilling to communicate or write.

“Actually, Little Qi might not know how to communicate with you.” Seeing how upset he was, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but comfort him.

Gu Zhou stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian, as if hoping that she would continue.

Qiao Nian organized her thoughts and said, “He seemed to have said before that you liked girls and not boys, so he was too embarrassed to talk to you.”

Gu Zhou frowned. When had he said such a thing?

“Why don’t you have a good chat with Little Qi? I think you might lack communication.” Qiao Nian also hoped that Gu Qi could live a happy life. This way, he wouldn’t have to worry so much, because he missed his mother so much that she wouldn’t sleep at night.

The reason why she had told him about her interactions with Gu Qi was because she wanted to tell Gu Zhou that perhaps Gu Qi was not ill at all. He had pretended to be ill because he wanted to seek attention.

Gu Zhou kept his head lowered. After a while, he said, “Give me the IOU.”

“Okay.” Qiao Nian hurriedly sent the note to Gu Zhou. She hoped that Gu Qi would recover soon.

Gu Zhou saved the photo of the IOU and lowered his head. “I’ll go have a good talk with him.”

“Don’t scare him,” Qiao Nian said gently.

Gu Zhou nodded and walked towards Gu Qi’s room.

From Qiao Nian’s words, he saw a different Little Qi. Perhaps Little Qi was really as Qiao Nian had said.

What made Gu Zhou even more uncomfortable was that Little Qi had actually hidden himself so deeply. He was so young, but he already had so many tricks up his sleeve.

When Gu Zhou walked to the door of Gu Qi’s room, he pursed his thin lips and knocked.

As usual, there was no reaction from the room.

Gu Zhou pushed the door open and walked in, closing it behind him.

At this moment, Gu Qi was already squatting in a corner of the ground. The sunlight could not reach him. He looked extremely lonely and pitiful.

At this moment, Gu Qi was already squatting in a corner of the ground. The sunlight could not reach him. He looked extremely lonely and pitiful.

He seemed unwilling to communicate with anyone, nor with his father.

Seeing Gu Qi like this, Gu Zhou squatted down and looked at him seriously.

If it weren’t for Qiao Nian, he would have really thought that Gu Qi was born with autism. He wouldn’t have been fooled by a child like Gu Qi.

Perhaps it was because he had spent too little time with him. That was why Little Qi had sealed his heart and refused to interact with him.

“Gu Qi,” Gu Zhou called out softly.

At this moment, Little Qi was still indifferent, as if he had not heard Gu Zhou’s voice at all.

“Gu Qi.”

Gu Qi still did not move.

Gu Zhou pursed his lips and spoke again. “Gu Qi.”

This time, Gu Qi finally reacted. He looked up at Gu Zhou and stared unblinkingly at him. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Gu Qi’s facial features were exquisite. Even though he had yet to mature, he would definitely be handsome when he grew up.

However, what surprised him was that Gu Qi didn’t look like him.

Gu Zhou knew that children took after their parents. In that case, Gu Qi should look like his mother.

Before the child grew up, he had found a few women who looked similar, but they were not related to Gu Qi by blood.

“Little Qi, do you have anything to say to Dad?”

Little Qi frowned and said, “No.”

Gu Zhou was speechless.
