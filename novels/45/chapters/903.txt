904 He Wants to Pick You Up

Qiao Nian felt Lu Zhu’s concern, and her heart warmed.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips slightly and said, “Brother, the most important thing now should be to investigate what happened more than twenty years ago. We’ll talk about the rest later.”

Seeing that Qiao Nian’s expression was off, Lu Zhu had a bad feeling. Puzzled, he asked, “Are you no longer willing to be with him?”

If Sugar was willing to be with Gu Zhou, she would not say anything else until a later time.

Lu Zhu felt that all of this was fate making fools of him.

Sugar was not in the wrong, nor was Gu Zhou.

The ones in the wrong were those who were playing tricks behind the scenes.

Qiao Nian didn’t speak. She stood there with her eyes lowered.

Lu Zhu frowned slightly. Sugar should still be hesitating.

Qiao Nian gripped her bag tightly and smiled at Lu Zhu. “Brother, you don’t have to worry about me anymore.”

Actually, she hadn’t thought of how to deal with this matter.

Lu Zhu nodded and watched Qiao Nian leave.

His greatest wish was for Qiao Nian to be happy.

When Qiao Nian left the cafe, she looked at the traffic outside and sighed deeply.

She walked towards the parking lot. She still had to make a trip to the paternity test center.

Although she had already guessed that Gu Qi and Xiao Shi were her children, she still believed in the facts more, so she planned to do another DNA test with Gu Qi and Xiao Shi herself.

The car drove for about half an hour before they arrived at the paternity test center.

Qiao Nian quickly walked towards the paternity test center. She walked into the paternity test center, then took out a strand of her own hair and extracted the DNA inside.

She still operated on her own. She didn’t trust anyone else now.

Qiao Nian did it very seriously. Not long after, the results of her DNA test with Gu Qi and Xiao Shi were out.

When she saw the results, she understood.

Indeed, it was exactly as she had thought. Gu Qi and Xiao Shi were really her children.

Qiao Nian’s eyes turned red again, and she felt a lump in her throat.

For some reason, she recalled the scene of the doctor carrying the dead baby over after she gave birth.

At that time, when she knew that the child she had painstakingly given birth to were dead, her entire world collapsed.

She sat on the hospital bed with the dead baby in her arms and cried hysterically.

If her children were all alive, who was the dead baby?

Could it be that even her childbirth had been tampered with by those people?

Qiao Nian felt a chill run down her spine. Those people were really pervasive.

At this moment, her phone suddenly rang. It was Gu Qi calling her.

Qiao Nian’s heart began to race. Gu Qi was her child.

Realizing this, Qiao Nian picked up the call eagerly.

“Mommy!” Gu Qi’s childish voice came through the phone.

Qiao Nian was touched. In the past, she liked Gu Qi calling her that. Now that she knew that Gu Qi was her child, she felt that Gu Qi’s voice sounded better than before.

Qiao Nian’s tears fell uncontrollably.

Worried that Gu Qi would hear her voice, she hurriedly covered her mouth with her hand. A tear fell down her cheek.

Gu Qi sat on the bed and didn’t hear Qiao Nian’s answer on the phone. He glanced at his phone, and the screen showed that he was on a call. He called out tentatively again, “Mommy?”

Qiao Nian sniffled and tried hard to remain calm. She hurriedly replied, “Yes, I’m here. Xiao Qi, why aren’t you asleep?”

Qiao Nian glanced at the time. It was already past three in the morning.

Gu Qi gripped his phone tightly and asked in a childish voice, “Dad told me that you left in a hurry. Mommy, I’m a little worried about you. When are you coming back?”

The smile on Qiao Nian’s face froze. She pursed her lips and said, “Where is Dad now?”

“Dad’s right next to me. He wants to pick you up. Where are you now?”

Qiao Nian recalled what had happened that night and had mixed feelings. She didn’t want Gu Qi to be sad, so she said casually, “I have something important to do tonight, so I won’t go back first. Go to bed early. Children can’t stay up late.”

On the other end of the phone, Gu Qi seemed to be silent for a moment. Then, Qiao Nian heard Gu Qi say, “Mommy, Dad said that it’s not safe at night. He’s planning to pick you up.”
