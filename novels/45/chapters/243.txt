Chapter 244: Scheming B*tch

When Ye Ran heard Qiao Nian’s words, the blood drained from her face. Her tears of grievance fell as she tried hard to explain. “I’m really not lying to you. My father does know Mr. Dong Hua, and they’re quite close. Mr. Dong Hua even came to our house as a guest some time ago. This ticket was handed to me by our nanny. I didn’t know that this ticket was fake either. There must be some other misunderstanding!”

But at this moment, no one believed Ye Ran’s words.

When Gao Lin thought of how she had lowered herself to please Ye Ran yesterday, the anger on her face became even more obvious.

In order to please Ye Ran, the others also gave her a lot of gifts.

These people were all furious and wanted to settle scores with Ye Ran.

Ye Ran stood there, looking at her usually amiable classmates with teary eyes. She felt as if she had been abandoned by the entire world.

Professor Zhang looked at the pitiful state of his beloved student, Ye Ran, and couldn’t bear to see her like this. He said coldly, “If you want to cause trouble in school, you don’t have to stay. You can also go through the withdrawal procedures.”

When Gao Lin and the other students heard Professor Zhang’s words, they stood rooted to the ground, no longer daring to attack. They could only forcibly suppress their anger.

However, they had all thought it through. As long as they left the school, they would never let Ye Ran off.

Professor Zhang’s gaze swept across Gao Lin and the other students. He asked, “Who was the one who searched Qiao Nian and Wang Xuan’s desks just now? Who else attacked her?”

Gao Lin was the first to step forward. Seeing this, the other four also stepped forward.

Professor Zhang’s gaze swept across the five of them. “All of you will be given a demerit and have to write a self-reflection letter. Also, the five of you must apologize to Qiao Nian properly and obtain her forgiveness!”

A trace of a cunning look flashed in Gao Lin’s eyes. She was the first to step forward and walk in front of Qiao Nian. She bowed 90 degrees and said apologetically, “Student Qiao Nian, I was in the wrong today. I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have listened to Ye Ran’s nonsense, nor should I have doubted you. Please be magnanimous and don’t take issue with me!”

Gao Lin’s thoughts were very simple. She felt that since Qiao Nian could get tickets to Mr. Dong Hua’s concert, it meant that Qiao Nian had a way to get tickets.

If she wanted to attend Mr. Dong Hua’s concert in the future, she could ask Qiao Nian for help. However, before that, she had to build a good relationship with Qiao Nian.

Gao Lin had never expected that wretched girl, Wang Xuan, to continue helping Qiao Nian. In that case, Wang Xuan must have known that Qiao Nian had tickets.

Wang Xuan was truly a scheming b*tch!

However, after this incident, Gao Lin felt that Qiao Nian was very likely to become friends with Wang Xuan. Wang Xuan was blocking her path. She had to think of a way to get Wang Xuan away from Qiao Nian. Only then would she become Qiao Nian’s best friend.

Seeing how readily Gao Lin apologized, the other four hurriedly stepped forward and apologized to Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian smiled and didn’t pursue the matter further. Professor Zhang had given her enough face, so she shouldn’t cause trouble anymore.

In the end, this farce ended with Ye Ran leaving the school in tears.

After this incident, the way the students in the class looked at Qiao Nian had changed.

Actually, on the first day Qiao Nian arrived, they had already investigated her background. However, Qiao Nian’s ability to get a ticket to Mr. Dong Hua’s concert was enough to prove that they hadn’t investigated thoroughly enough. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

What did this mean?

This meant that Qiao Nian’s identity had been hidden. They had only found information that Qiao Nian wanted them to see.

Hence, they came to a conclusion. There must be a big shot behind Qiao Nian.

Professor Zhang had already settled this matter, so he left. Seeing this, Gao Lin immediately gave a sweet smile and walked towards Qiao Nian.

“Nian Nian, you have such a good temperament. When you arrived yesterday, I already knew that you were the daughter of a rich family. Just now, Ye Ran even falsely accused you of stealing, so I went to consult Professor Zhang to seek justice for you. Fortunately, Professor Zhang arrived quickly and helped you clear your name.” Gao Lin smiled as her gaze fell on the violin in Qiao Nian’s hand.
