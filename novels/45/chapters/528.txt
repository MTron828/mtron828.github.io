Qiao Nian hurriedly nodded. She was extremely nervous now. With a serious expression, she said, “Think about it. If you hadn’t suggested it, I wouldn’t have dared to hug you, right?”

Seeing Qiao Nian’s panicked expression, Gu Zhou couldn’t help but recall her valiant and heroic appearance when she had brought Lu Zhu out of the ghost city that day. The corners of his lips curled up slightly as he asked, “Are you trying to say that if I take the initiative to ask, you’ll do as I say?”

“I—”

Before Qiao Nian could finish speaking, Gu Zhou slowly interrupted her and said, “Alright, I’ll let you hug me again!”

Qiao Nian was speechless.

Qiao Nian’s beautiful eyes were filled with shock as she stared at the man in front of her in disbelief.

He was not the second personality, Zhou Zhou, nor was he the third personality, Gu Chuan. He was Gu Zhou himself!

How could he make such a request?

Was something wrong with his head?

Qiao Nian swallowed, thinking about how to reject him.

At this moment, the man suddenly approached Qiao Nian. His gaze landed on her lips, and he asked in an ambiguous voice, “Why aren’t you moving?”

Qiao Nian’s face turned red uncontrollably. She got off the bed silently and muttered, “How can this be the same? You caught a cold previously. I can’t just leave you alone, right? Besides, you’re fine now. Why should I hug you and coax you?”

With that, Qiao Nian walked away in her slippers.

She had just taken a step when she felt a weight on her hand.

The man gripped her hand tightly. With a squeeze, she fell towards the bed uncontrollably.

Caught off guard, Qiao Nian fell into Gu Zhou’s arms.

Her heart was so nervous that it was about to jump out of her chest. Her face was slightly hot, and she did not dare to look at Gu Zhou. “You, what on earth…”

The man’s hand tightened around her waist as he stared intently into Qiao Nian’s eyes. His gaze gradually turned scrutinizing as he said, “You seem to be hiding something else from me.”

Qiao Nian’s heart trembled.

So Gu Zhou wasn’t teasing her on purpose. He was just suspecting her.

Qiao Nian shook her head without thinking. With a serious expression, she said, “I have nothing to hide from you. You were indeed drenched in the rain last night. Your condition wasn’t good. You even had a fever.”

The scrutiny in Gu Zhou’s eyes gradually dissipated. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. Seeing that Gu Zhou believed her, she struggled to get up. “It’s getting late. I’ll go wash up first. Brother Zhu is still in the hospital. I wonder if he can be discharged today!”

Gu Zhou’s uneasy heart had just calmed down when he heard Qiao Nian address Lu Zhu. He watched thoughtfully as Qiao Nian entered the bathroom.

“Brother Lu Zhu?”

He hadn’t expected that Qiao Nian and Lu Zhu’s relationship would improve so quickly in just four days.

Gu Zhou narrowed his eyes slightly. He gently rubbed the ring on his thumb, and his expression darkened.

Qiao Nian walked into the bathroom and immediately closed the door. She turned on the shower to release the hot water, her heart still beating wildly.

After interacting with Gu Zhou just now, she now felt that Zhou Zhou was the easiest to get along with.

Be it Gu Zhou or Gu Chuan…

It was all too hard.

She was about to be killed by them.

She had to study schizophrenia properly. She had to think of a way to treat Gu Zhou.

However, she still had a worry in her heart.

If she cured Gu Zhou’s illness, would Gu Zhou’s second and third personalities disappear? Or would they combine and become the first personality? At that time, would Gu Zhou himself remember everything, or would he forget everything?

Would the other personalities disappear forever?
