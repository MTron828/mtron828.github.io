“Mom, have you seen her?” Lu Qi asked curiously.

Although Shen An was his mother’s teacher, Shen Mei was only Shen An’s daughter. It was normal for his mother to not have seen Shen Mei.

When Su Yan heard Lu Qi’s question, there was a trace of a smile in her eyes. She nodded. Her thoughts gradually drifted away, and a young face gradually appeared in front of her.

There was something wrong with Shen Mei’s brain, so her eyes were clear. Usually, her reactions were a little slower than others. She looked like a harmless little white rabbit, making one involuntarily dote on her.

Su Yan came back to her senses and said with a smile, “Actually, I don’t know her. I’ve seen Shen Mei a few times when I was by Teacher’s side.”

Su Yan recalled what Shen An had told her and sighed. “Back then, Teacher had always wanted her to live like a normal person. Shen Mei was also very hardworking. She studied all kinds of things every day. If those people hadn’t pulled Teacher into that matter, Teacher wouldn’t have been used, much less been separated from his daughter for so many years. Now, Teacher…”

From the corner of her eye, Qiao Nian glanced at Auntie Cao, who was not far away. She hurriedly said, “It’s a pity that Professor Shen An has already left. The father and daughter will never be reunited again. It’s all my fault for implicating them back then.”

Su Yan was slightly stunned. She almost said that her teacher was still alive.

However, everyone in the family was an insider. If Teacher was still alive, it should be fine if she said it out loud.

Since Qiao Nian had suddenly interrupted, Su Yan couldn’t say anything else.

Gu Zhou reached out and held Qiao Nian’s hand. “Nian’er, actually, you can’t say that. Back then, the Lu family didn’t do anything wrong. Whether it was you being kidnapped or Professor Shen An and his daughter being separated for so many years, it was all the fault of those who wanted to harm you. They were the ones who were heartless and dragged innocent people in.”

Lu Nian agreed with Gu Zhou very much. His voice was cold. “Sugar, the victim’s theory of guilt is wrong to begin with. Don’t be brainwashed.”Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

What terrified them the most was that they still didn’t know who wanted to deal with the Lu family back then.

There was a satisfied smile in Su Yan’s eyes. Her child had already grown up, and her worldview was upright. She even had her own opinions. “Nian’er, it’s indeed not advisable to be a saint, but Shen Mei has been separated from her father for so many years. She’s indeed pitiful.”

Qiao Nian smiled. Actually, she didn’t feel guilty at all. She had only said that to change the topic. She was worried that other people with ulterior motives would find out that Shen An was still alive.

Out of the corner of her eye, she glanced at Auntie Cao. Auntie Cao had already regained her composure and was scooping soup for everyone.

“Mom, I understand.” Qiao Nian continued after Su Yan’s words.

Su Yan looked at Qiao Nian. Thinking about how Teacher Shen An had confessed everything to her in the end and even thought of a way to keep Sugar alive, she asked, “How is Shen Mei now? Does her husband treat her well?”

Su Yan didn’t want to gossip about the husband-and-wife relationship between the President and the First Madam of Europe. Instead, she treated it as an elder showing concern for his friends and juniors.

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian looked at each other. Qiao Nian had a bright smile on her face as she said, “She’s very happy now. The President loves her very much. Her daughter is also very obedient and loves her very much!”

The smile on Su Yan’s face grew more sincere. She nodded. “Alright, that’s good.”

After dinner, the children went out to have fun. Lu Qi and Song Yu also went to do their own things.

Qiao Nian’s four brothers, Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian went to Lu Zhu’s study together. The six of them stood in the study. Sunlight filtered through the French windows, illuminating the entire room and falling on them. A gentle light seemed to shine on everyone.

Looking at their room from the grass in the distance, they were like a painting. They were so beautiful that one could not take their eyes off them.

The four brothers of the Lu family sat on one side of the sofa, while Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou sat on the other. Seeing that they were staring at her, Qiao Nian suddenly felt a sense of oppression.

She tilted her head and smiled. “Why are you looking at me like that?” she asked slyly.. “Have I become ugly?”
