“Tm not a doctor in any hospital. It’s normal for Doctor Su to not know of me. But Doctor Su, do you remember what you said just now?”

A trace of embarrassment flashed across Doctor Su’s face. He still remembered what he had just said.

He felt that he had truly overestimated his own abilities.

However, he had to concede defeat. He was not a sore loser, nor one who would go back on his word.

Letting out a helpless sigh, Doctor Su replied, “I know. I will withdraw from the medical field in the future, and will no longer treat anyone else ever again.”

Qiao Nian’s expression was blank as she spoke. “There’s no need for that. I hope Doctor Su can nurse Grandma back to good health.”

At Qiao Nian’s words, everyone was stunned.

Even Doctor Su was stunned.

His attitude just now had been dreadful. He had practically accused Qiao Nian of being a liar.

Now that he heard Qiao Nian’s words, he felt immensely guilty. When he looked at Qiao Nian again, his eyes were filled with admiration.

Qiao Nian was so young, but she was so magnanimous.

Most people would not be able to achieve the same level of character.

“I’m sorry, Second Young Madam. In the future, I’ll take proper care of Matriarch Gu’s health. If there’s anything you need from me in the future, I’l definitely go through hell and high water for you without hesitation!” Doctor Su said sincerely.

Qiao Nian’s expression was indifferent. “That won’t be necessary.”

Actually, Qiao Nian could understand what Dr. Su had just done.

If this were to happen to an ordinary doctor, they would naturally think that there was no chance of Grandma making it out alive. Hence, Doctor Su just wanted for Grandma to pass away in peace.

This was because Doctor Su’s medical skills were not entirely up to standard.

Hence, the blame shouldn’t lie on only Doctor Su’s shoulders.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Jiang Yue. Jiang Yue began to feel a little uncomfortable under her gaze. She lowered her head, her mind racing as she thought about how to get rid of the suspicion that had fallen on her.

Just as she was about to speak, Matriarch Gu awakened.

Matriarch Gu opened her eyes slightly and looked at Gu Zhou, who was standing by her bed. Her eyes were slightly red-rimmed as she said weakly, “Ah Zhou…”

“Grandma!” Seeing that Matriarch Gu had awoken, Jiang Yue looked as if she had seen a ray of hope. She hurriedly rushed over with teary eyes, calling out excitedly.

However, Gu Zhou turned around and blocked Jiang Yue from view.

Gu Zhou looked down at Matriarch Gu and reached out to grab her hand. His voice was as low as ever. “Grandma.”

“Tseem to have had a very long dream. I dreamed that I met the king of the underworld, He wanted me to reincarnate.” At this point, Matriarch Gu began to sob.

A trace of worry flashed in Gu Zhou’s eyes, but he quickly recovered his usual composure. “It was just a dream.”

Matriarch Gu’s eyes were red. This was actually the first time she had had such a close brush with death.

However, when she thought about leaving Ah Zhou and Little Qi behind after her death, her heart ached terribly.

Actually, the person she was most worried about was Ah Zhou. This child had a phobia of women and was extremely paranoid. If he didn’t get together with Nian Nian, he would probably be alone for the rest of his life.

Now, her greatest hope was to see Gu Zhou live a happy life before she passed.

Matriarch Gu turned to look at Qiao Nian, who was standing at the side. She said softly, “Nian Nian.”

“Grandma.” Seeing Matriarch Gu in such a weak state, Qiao Nian thought of her own grandmother, who had raised her since she was young, She felt terrible.

“Theard a little of what just happened.” Matriarch Gu looked at Qiao Nian gratefully. “Without you, I might not have woken up. You’re really the lucky star of the Gu family.”

“It’s all my fault that you’ve suffered so much this time.” Qiao Nian shook her head slightly. In her heart, she blamed herself greatly. “If I had been able to keep an eye on the medicinal room, such a serious mishap would not have happened.”

“This has nothing to do with you. No one can possibly keep their guard up forever, nor maintain constant vigilance.” Matriarch Gu spoke up to comfort her. “This is someone else’s fault, not yours. Don’t blame yourself for this…”
