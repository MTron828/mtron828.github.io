Chapter 518: Zhou Zhou Can’t Find You

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian frowned and blurted out, “You… you’re not Gu Zhou?”

The other party was silent for a moment, as if he was a little hurt. Then, he said, “How many times do I have to tell you before you remember that I’m Zhou Zhou, not the Gu Zhou you’re talking about!”

Qiao Nian was shocked.

Qiao Nian’s eyes widened involuntarily. She felt as if she had been struck by lightning. She was dumbfounded.

Qiao Nian’s heart raced, and her mind buzzed. She even forgot to think.

She never expected Gu Zhou’s second personality to appear and even call her.

Her head was pounding now, and she didn’t know what to do.

His dissatisfied voice came from the phone. “Nian Nian, where are you? Zhou Zhou can’t find you!”

Qiao Nian was speechless. Didn’t he say that he had something important to do? Why was he feeling aggrieved?

She was really curious. What could make Gu Zhou’s emotions fluctuate so much?

However, she did not have the time to dwell on this matter now. Zhou Zhou’s personality was very innocent and did not have the slightest resistance. What if something happened?

Qiao Nian was as anxious as a cat on a hot tin roof. She took off the mask on her face and sat on the bed. She hurriedly asked, “Zhou Zhou, where are you now? I’ll look for you.”

“Does Nian Nian really not like Zhou Zhou anymore?”

Qiao Nian was speechless. No matter what she asked, he wouldn’t answer. He probably didn’t know Chen Qing anymore.

Helpless, Qiao Nian could only hang up and call Chen Qing. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

On the other hand, Chen Qing was woken up by his phone ringing.

He took out his phone from his pocket. He had just woken up and was a little dazed. When he saw that the call was from Qiao Nian, he instantly sobered up.

Chen Qing greeted her respectfully. “Madam!”

Qiao Nian asked worriedly, “Chen Qing, where is Gu Zhou now?”

Chen Qing was in a daze from his sleep. When he heard Qiao Nian’s question, his expression changed.

Madam would definitely not call for no reason. Something must have happened to Second Young Master.

Chen Qing got up and hurried into the back room. He turned on the light in the room and saw that the bed was empty.

He had a bad feeling and quickly said, “Madam, Second Master is missing.”

Qiao Nian’s expression darkened instantly. She asked anxiously, “What do you mean?”

Thinking about what had happened recently, he frowned and said honestly, “Second Young Master has been in a bad mood for the past two days. He has been locking himself in his room. I was guarding him outside. I just entered the room and realized that he was gone.”

“Then go and feel the temperature on the bed now,” Qiao Nian said anxiously.

“Yes.”

Qiao Nian’s heart beat faster and faster. She didn’t know what had happened to Gu Zhou to force Zhou Zhou out. The thought of the wound on Gu Zhou’s back made her expression turn even uglier.

She could tell from the marks on Gu Zhou’s wounds that the other party wanted to cut off Gu Zhou’s neck and kill him.

However, Gu Zhou cleverly dodged the attack, so he only injured his shoulder blade.

But now that simple-minded Zhou Zhou was out, could he still survive if he encountered another enemy?

“Oh no, madam. Second Master’s bed is completely cold.”

Chen Qing’s voice instantly pulled Qiao Nian back to reality.

“Don’t spout nonsense!” Qiao Nian frowned, her voice laced with anger.

Only then did Chen Qing realize that he had said something that would easily be misunderstood. He quickly corrected himself and said, “Madam, I-I think Second Young Master might have left long ago.”

Qiao Nian’s heart sank. Her eyelids kept twitching as she hurriedly said, “Go and look for him immediately. Search for him somewhere near where you live. You must find him!”
