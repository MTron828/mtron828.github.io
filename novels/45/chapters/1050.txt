1051 Dodge the bullet

At six in the evening.

Just as Qiao Nian was making pills in the medicinal room, her cell phone suddenly rang!

She stopped what she was doing and took out her phone. She saw a message from Fourth Brother.

“He Cheng has already been taken away by the police. He’ll probably stay in there for a few years before coming out!”

!!

Qiao Nian’s lips curved up slightly. She replied swiftly, “How’s Qiao Xin?”

“The beggars in the temple only know that they were invited over by He Cheng. Some of them also know that He Cheng had a sugar daddy behind him, but they didn’t know that the sugar daddy was Qiao Xin. As there’s insufficient evidence, Qiao Xin can’t be convicted!”

When Qiao Nian saw Lu Jiang’s messages, she lowered her gaze slightly and replied.

“Qiao Xin has always thought highly of herself. This kind of punishment is world-destroying for her. Her reputation has already been ruined, and she no longer has the face to appear in An City. I don’t think she can do anything!”

After Qiao Nian sent the message, she closed her phone!

She had also watched a little of the video of Qiao Xin being gang-raped. When she saw many people raping her, she was stunned. She had never expected Qiao Xin to come up with such a disgusting plan.

Six years ago, Qiao Xin was prepared to find an old man to ruin her innocence. Now, Qiao Xin was even more disgusting than before!

Qiao Xin must be on the verge of breaking down. Not only had Qiao Xin not framed her, but she had also suffered the consequences of her own actions.

Qiao Nian couldn’t be bothered to think about Qiao Xin anymore. She was just a little curious. Back then, Qiao Xin had found her an old man. Why was Gu Zhou the one who had sex with her that night?

“What are you thinking?”

Gu Zhou’s voice suddenly rang in her ears.

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She turned to look at Gu Zhou, and the words “Dongjiang Villa” suddenly appeared in her mind!

Could it be that Gu Zhou wanted to take her directly to the Dongjiang villa?

“No, I’m not thinking about anything!” Qiao Nian immediately looked away. At the thought that it was very likely that she would have sex with Gu Zhou, the tips of her ears turned red uncontrollably!

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian in confusion. For some reason, he felt that Qiao Nian was a little strange!

Gu Zhou pulled a chair over and sat down beside Qiao Nian, watching her make the pill!

Sensing Gu Zhou’s gaze, Qiao Nian glanced at him from the corner of her eye and asked, “Why are you looking at me?”

“I have something to tell you!”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she realized that she was overthinking. She stopped what she was doing and sat down beside Gu Zhou, looking at him seriously. “What is it?”

It didn’t seem to be about the Dongjiang villa.

As long as the Dongjiang villa was not mentioned, she would not be nervous.

“My mother is back today!” Gu Zhou paused for a moment and continued, “She asked me out for dinner tonight. I want you to go with me!”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. After staying in the Gu family for so long, she had almost forgotten that Gu Zhou’s biological mother was still alive.

In the past, she had heard Matriarch Gu talk about Gu Zhou’s mother. Gu Zhou’s mother was really too strict with Gu Zhou. Gu Zhou’s mother had even treated Gu Zhou as medicine in the past.

Although she could understand that Gu Zhou’s mother had done all of this so that the eldest young master of the Gu family could live well, she still did not like Gu Zhou’s mother.

She would know what kind of person Gu Zhou’s mother was when she met her.

Qiao Nian looked at the pill in her hand and hesitated for a moment. Frowning, she asked, “Your mother has actually returned. Then why didn’t she come to the Gu family villa?”

Gu Zhou said calmly, “Grandma seems to have some conflict with her. They’ve never been on good terms. Later on, they lived separately!”

Gu Zhou lowered his gaze slightly. He didn’t know why they had quarreled, but he had heard from Grandma that the Gu family villa was Grandma and Grandpa’s property. After that, Mom had never returned!

At that time, Grandma had also given a death order not to let his mother step into the Gu family villa again.

Qiao Nian’s eyes flickered. She had a vague feeling that Matriarch Gu and Gu Zhou’s mother’s argument might be related to Gu Zhou.

After all, Gu Zhou was just a drug in his mother’s eyes!

At the thought that Gu Zhou had been raised as a source of medication, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but feel sorry for him. No wonder Gu Zhou had a personality called Zhou Zhou. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Qiao Nian reached out and held Gu Zhou’s hand, as if this was the only way she could feel that Gu Zhou was alive.
