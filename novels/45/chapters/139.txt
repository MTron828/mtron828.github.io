Chapter 140 Do It

Qiao Shan had been humiliated utterly. He had no dignity left.

“You…” Qiao Shan was so angry that his lips were trembling

“Mr. Qiao Shan, have you forgotten that I no longer have anything to do with the Qiao family?” Qiao Nian said calmly.

Qiao Xin, who was standing at the side, had already lost her mind. She roared, “Qiao Nian, are you crazy? How dare you act out? This is Dad we’re talking about. Do you still want to hit Mom after hitting Dad?”

Hearing Qiao Xin’s words, Su Xue hurriedly covered Qiao Xin’s mouth.

Her silly daughter. How could she say anything more at a time like this? What if Qiao Nian really stepped forward to hit her?

Su Xue’s heart jumped to her throat. She looked at Qiao Nian in fear, meeting her gaze.

Su Xue didn’t quite dare to meet Qiao Nian’s eyes. She lowered her gaze uneasily.

She was already prepared to be slapped.

At this moment, Su Xue felt as if there was a knife hanging over her head. She didn’t know when this knife would fall.

Su Xue waited for a long time. Seeing that Qiao Nian didn’t make a move, she looked up at her.

She saw that Qiao Nian had been staring at her the entire time. It was a terrible feeling, and it made her hair stand on end.

“I’ll save your beating for another day. Be prepared for it in the future,” Qiao Nian said coldly.

Once she figured out what the conversation between Su Xue and the gigolo meant, she would get even with Su Xue.

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Su Xue heaved a long sigh of relief, thinking that she had finally escaped the ordeal.

“Chen Qing.” Gu Zhou raised his eyebrow, his gaze falling on Su Xue’s face. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Chen Qing followed Gu Zhou’s gaze and instantly understood. Su Xue felt a chill run down her spine. She cursed silently when she saw Chen Qing walking towards her.

Su Xue stepped back uneasily, but Chen Qing grabbed her by the collar.

Chen Qing looked at Su Xue’s sanctimonious face and felt a wave of irritation. He flung a slap at her face.

Chen Qing’s strength was so great that Su Xue’s neatly arranged hair flew into a mess.

At this moment, Su Xue was already seeing stars. Half of her face was swollen, and she didn’t even dare to cry. She looked extremely disheveled.

Only then did Gu Zhou retract his gaze in satisfaction. He looked at Qiao Nian and said in a low and magnetic voice, “Let’s back home. Grandma wants us home for dinner.”

With that, Gu Zhou took Qiao Nian’s hand and got ready to leave with her.

Qiao Xin, who was standing not far away, noted Gu Zhou’s gentle manner towards Qiao Nian. Her eyes couldn’t help but turn red.

This kind of quiet happiness should have belonged to her.

She couldn’t take this lying down!

She wouldn’t go down without a fight!

She had to get back the happiness that belonged to her. After Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian left, Qiao Xin’s lips trembled in anger. She said furiously, “Mom, Dad, Qiao Nian has gone too far. How dare she be so arrogant!”

Qiao Shan was also furious, but he didn’t dare to touch Qiao Nian at all. He was worried that Gu Zhou would interfere with the Qiao family’s business.

But Qiao Xin couldn’t think about that. All she could think about was revenge!

Qiao Xin said tearfully, “When Big Brother comes back, we must teach Qiao Nian a lesson!”

When Qiao Shan heard Qiao Xin’s words, his heart skipped a beat, and his lips curved up involuntarily.

His eldest son, Qiao Yu, was the most capable child in the Qiao family. If Qiao Yu knew that they had been bullied to such a state by Qiao Nian, he would definitely punish Qiao Nian.

The knot in Qiao Shan’s heart gradually loosened.

Qiao Xin sobbed as she asked, “Dad, when will Big Brother be back?”

Qiao Shan raised his hand, and his face turned pale from the pain. However, when he thought of his eldest son, his eyes were filled with pride. “He will definitely return home before the lecture at the Second Academy of Medicine begins.”

Covering the swollen half of her face, Su Xue smiled. She asked happily, “Really?”

“Of course it’s true. He was specially invited by Director Lin to give a speech. No one has received such a great honor in An City!” Qiao Shan straightened his back and said proudly.
