Chapter 697: Jealousy

She refused to concede defeat.

It was all Qiao Nian’s fault.

Qiao Nian had stolen everything that had originally belonged to her. She had to get everything back. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Jiang Yue.”

A sweet voice rang out from the side, interrupting Jiang Yue’s thoughts.

Jiang Yue took a deep breath and instantly retracted all her thoughts. A sweet and adorable smile appeared on her face as she turned around. “Sister Song Yu.”

Song Yu was wearing a black knee-length dress today, revealing her sexy collarbone, but she looked a little tired.

Song Yu walked up to Jiang Yue and said softly, “I went to the bathroom just now, but I couldn’t find you. I thought you had gone home.”

Jiang Yue hurriedly revealed a faint smile and walked up to Song Yu. She took Song Yu’s arm and said softly, “If I leave, I have to tell Sister Song Yu first. Moreover, today is a special day. I also want to offer incense to the eldest daughter of the Lu family.”

Ever since Jiang Yue had been chased out of the Gu family, she had been hiding everywhere. She knew that Matriarch Gu would be coming to the Lu family today, so she couldn’t wait to look for Song Yu.

She was just telling Jiang Yue that there was some misunderstanding between her and Grandma. Grandma was angry with her now, so she had temporarily separated from Grandma. She wanted to take the opportunity to reconcile with Grandma today.

The Gu and Lu families had a good relationship. Jiang Yue and Song Yu had grown up together, so Song Yu did not doubt Jiang Yue’s words.

“Grandma Gu might arrive a little later. I’ll tell you when she does.” Song Yu held Jiang Yue’s hand and walked in, instructing in a low voice, “When Grandma Gu leaves, talk to her properly. I believe she won’t be angry with you anymore.”

“Okay.” Jiang Yue lowered her gaze and nodded obediently.

“Then come with me now. There are a lot of things to do today, so I might not be able to take good care of you. Why don’t you stay in my bedroom?” Song Yu was also busy with the anniversary of the death of the eldest daughter of the Lu family. If Jiang Yue hadn’t grown up with her, she definitely wouldn’t have entertained her at this time.

“Sister Song Yu, just go about your business. Don’t worry about me. I’m familiar with the Lu family too. I can take care of myself,” Jiang Yue said softly.

Song Yu thought that Jiang Yue often came to the Lu family, and that she was very sensible. Nothing should happen.

Suddenly, Song Yu seemed to have thought of something. She pursed her lips slightly and looked up at Jiang Yue. “By the way, I heard that Qiao Nian lives in the Gu residence?”

Hearing Song Yu’s question, Jiang Yue’s frown deepened.

Song Yu looked at Jiang Yue in surprise and asked in confusion, “What’s wrong? Did I say something wrong?”

Jiang Yue pursed her lips aggrievedly, tears welling up in her eyes. She shook her head gently and said pitifully, “Qiao Nian likes Brother Ah Zhou. Moreover, Grandma and I had a misunderstanding this time, and she was the one who played tricks behind our backs. She wanted to chase me out of the Gu family and marry Brother Ah Zhou!”

“Huh?”

“Sister Song Yu, I’m telling the truth!”

Song Yu’s eyes flashed, but she pretended to be puzzled. “I was just wondering if there was any misunderstanding between the two of you. I don’t think she’s that kind of person!”

“Sister Song Yu, one can’t judge a book by its cover but perhaps I’m overthinking!”

Song Yu reached out and held Jiang Yue’s arm as they walked in. She comforted her, “Actually, it’s normal for the elders to have some disagreements with us. Don’t think too much. Old people need to be coaxed. As long as you make Grandma Gu happy, she won’t be angry with you!”

When Jiang Yue heard Song Yu’s words, she recalled her grandmother’s determined expression that night. Her eyes instantly darkened, but she still replied, “Okay!”

Jiang Yue followed Song Yu in. After taking two steps, she seemed to have thought of something. She looked at Song Yu hesitantly, then lowered her head.

Song Yu naturally noticed Jiang Yue’s gaze. She asked curiously, “What’s wrong with you? Why can’t you tell me directly? We’re good friends!”
