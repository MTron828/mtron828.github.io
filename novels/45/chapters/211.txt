Chapter 212: Happy Birthday!

Qiao Nian didn’t know either. She had never expected Gu Zhou, who had always been cold and arrogant, to suddenly become like this. He was as silly and sweet as a spoiled young kid.

Seeing that Qiao Nian didn’t move, Gu Zhou pointed at his cheek where Qiao Nian had slapped him and said pitifully, “Nian Nian, blow on it. The pain will fly away!”

Gu Zhou’s skin had always been very fair. After being slapped by Qiao Nian, there was a bright red handprint on his face.

Gu Zhou moved his face closer to Qiao Nian and said huffily, “Nian Nian, blow for Zhou Zhou!”

Qiao Nian: ...

Zhou Zhou?

Blowing?

And “fly away”?

Qiao Nian felt a headache coming on. When she was in the village, she had seen many adults do this to their children, but she had never done this before.

Qiao Nian hesitated, thinking of how she should refuse Gu Zhou’s request. At this moment, she saw that tears were already welling up in the corners of Gu Zhou’s eyes. They would fall in the next moment.

Forget it.

If she didn’t blow on Gu Zhou’s face, he would probably cry until the end of time.

However, Qiao Nian still made a last-ditch attempt. She asked gently, “Shall I give you an egg to hold against your wound?”

“No, no. Nian Nian, hurry up and blow on it. The pain will fly away!”

Qiao Nian was so tired. She couldn’t help but frown.

Thinking that Qiao Nian was angry, Gu Zhou relented.

“Okay, okay. I want an egg!”

With that, Gu Zhou lowered his head, tears of grievance falling from his eyes.

Qiao Nian took out a tissue and carefully wiped the tears from Gu Zhou’s eyes. She coaxed softly, “I was in the wrong just now. Don’t be angry.”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, the light in his eyes grew brighter and brighter. He turned his head and looked around, his gaze finally landing on the crystal cup on the table.

Gu Zhou hurriedly reached for the cup and handed it to Qiao Nian fawningly, looking extremely obedient and sweet. “Nian Nian, this is my gift to you!”

Qiao Nian was certain that Gu Zhou was giving her a cup because of his illness.

A cup was not a casual gift.

Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou and pursed her lips. She asked, “Do you know what giving a cup means?”

Chen Qing, who was standing at the side, looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief.

By gifting Young Madam a cup, was Young Master planning to stay by Young Madam’s side for the rest of their?lives?1

Oh my god!

Second Young Master had finally grown up!

Second Young Master was so romantic!

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian, his phoenix-like eyes fully focused on her. He didn’t feel that there was anything wrong with what he was doing. With a serious expression, he said, “This was meant for Nian Nian!”

Qiao Nian was squatting at the side. When she heard Gu Zhou say “Nian Nian”, her mind burst into chaos.

For a moment, she had no words for how she was feeling.

She had slapped him because she didn’t want him to fall into a trance. She had never expected Gu Zhou to become mentally retarded!

“Nian Nian, happy birthday!” Gu Zhou handed the cup to Qiao Nian and said with a smile.

Qiao Nian looked at the crystal cup with a complicated expression. Under the sunlight, the crystal cup reflected a dazzling light, like the stars in his eyes.

For a moment, Qiao Nian couldn’t bear to reject Gu Zhou.

She felt that Gu Zhou must have been delirious to have given her the cup. When he regained consciousness, he would definitely regret this decision. When that happened, she would return the cup to its rightful owner!

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian accepted the cup and looked up at Gu Zhou. “Thank you.”

Gu Zhou frowned and puffed up his cheeks in dissatisfaction. “Nian Nian, you can’t thank me.”

“Why?” Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion.

Gu Zhou thought for a while. In the end, he shook his head and said firmly, “You just can’t!”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she felt a little guilty. She was an adult, so why should she argue with a child-like Gu Zhou?

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian placed the crystal cup into a wooden box at the side for safekeeping. Only then did she smile at Gu Zhou, speaking in a coaxing voice, “Alright, alright. I won’t say thank you to you again. It’s a little cold outside, and the wind is strong. Shall we go in?”Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m
