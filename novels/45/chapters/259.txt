Chapter 260: I’m Waiting For Him

Matriarch Gu was also sizing up Wang Xuan. As Wang Xuan had addressed her as “Matriarch Gu”, she couldn’t help but take another look at Wang Xuan. She had a nagging feeling that Wang Xuan looked a little familiar, but she couldn’t remember where she had seen her before. Smiling, she greeted, “Xuan Xuan, when you come to our house, you can be as casual as if you’re in your own home. Don’t be restrained. Our Nian Nian will need you to take care of her in the future.”

Wang Xuan smiled and shook her head. She said nonchalantly, “Matriarch Gu, don’t worry. She’s very smart. No one in the class can bully her. I’m the one who’s a little stupid. I’ll have to trouble her to teach me the violin!”

When Matriarch Gu heard Wang Xuan’s words, although she believed that Qiao Nian wouldn’t be bullied in school, she couldn’t help but worry.

Qiao Nian supported Matriarch Gu and walked in. Wang Xuan followed suit.

When they arrived at the living room, Qiao Nian smiled at Wang Xuan and said, “Xuan Xuan, sit here for a while. I’ll put the violin back in the room.”

Wang Xuan smiled and agreed. After their conversation just now, she was now completely certain that Qiao Nian was the Young Madam of the Gu family. When she found out about Qiao Nian’s identity, she was deeply shocked.

She thought of what Gao Lin had said and suddenly felt like she was watching a clown perform. No wonder Qiao Nian didn’t speak to Gao Lin at all. She didn’t take Gao Lin seriously at all! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

However, Gao Lin had always felt good about herself!

Holding the violin, Qiao Nian returned to her room. The door was slightly ajar.

Gu Zhou was back?

That made sense. Since the guest was Gu Zhou’s friend, Gu Zhou would definitely return.

Qiao Nian pushed the door open and entered. She saw a flirtatious-looking man standing inside.

The man heard movement at the door and looked up.

Qiao Nian could clearly see the man’s face. His facial features were very beautiful, as if he had been meticulously drawn by a master.

The man was still holding the zither figurine Xia Xue had given her.

Qiao Nian still liked the figurine Xia Xue had given her. She looked at the man warily and frowned slightly. “Who are you? Why are you in my room?”

Qiao Nian glanced at the figurine in the man’s hand and asked, “You even touched my things casually.”

When the man heard Qiao Nian’s words, he froze for a moment. Then, he placed the figurine back on the table. “I’m really sorry. I didn’t know this was yours.”

Qiao Nian didn’t speak. She walked to the side and placed the violin on the rack.

When the man saw the violin, a trace of surprise flashed in his deep eyes.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on the man’s fair and slender hands. His hands had been taken good care of. They were as smooth as silk, just like milk. Under the sunlight, they were dazzlingly white.

This was the first time she had seen such beautiful hands on a man. Such hands were very suitable for playing music.

Qiao Nian met his eyes and frowned slightly. “Are you here to look for Gu Zhou?”

“Yes, I’m waiting for him.”

When Qiao Nian heard the man’s words, she heaved a sigh of relief. The man in front of her was truly the most beautiful man she had ever seen. However, there was nothing feminine about him.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but take a few more glances at the man. It wasn’t because she was infatuated, but because she found the man in front of her a little familiar. She just couldn’t remember where she had seen him before.

When Gu Zhou came out of the cloakroom, he was wearing a casual white shirt and a pair of gray slacks. He looked much gentler.

If that man was like a spider lily growing next to the Bridge of Helplessness that was charming and beautiful, then Gu Zhou was like a snow lotus growing on a cliff, clear as jade.

Gu Zhou inadvertently met Qiao Nian’s gaze. Her gaze was actually a little similar to the one he had seen when he woke up in the bathroom.

“Come downstairs for dinner!”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she nodded. “Okay.”

She remembered that Wang Xuan was still downstairs, so she went downstairs first.
