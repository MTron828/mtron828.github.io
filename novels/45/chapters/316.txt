Chapter 317: Retarded

Gu Qi slid off the sofa and walked towards the kitchen. He stood on a small stool and brought down a fruit platter from the countertop. Carefully, he carried the platter to Zhang Yi.

Zhang Yi looked at Gu Qi and was slightly stunned. Gu Qi had never bothered with her in the past. He was completely immersed in his own world, as if everything around him had nothing to do with her.

Zhang Yi’s eyes darted to the side. “Bring over the homework your teacher told you to do!”

Gu Qi placed the fruit plate on the coffee table and walked towards the study. He took out his workbook from his small desk and walked back to Zhang Yi.

Seeing Gu Qi like this, Zhang Yi’s eyes lit up. She said, “The homework assigned by the teacher starts from question one to ten. If you don’t do it well, you won’t be able to sleep!”

Gu Qi opened his notebook and leaned on the small coffee table with a pencil and wrote seriously.

Seeing Gu Qi’s actions, Zhang Yi couldn’t help but smile. As long as Gu Qi wrote well, Gu Zhou would definitely think that she had taught him well the next time he came. He might even give her more money.

Perhaps Gu Zhou would even marry her because she was the most suitable person to take care of Gu Qi.

Before Gu Qi wrote anything, he glanced at the closed door. Holding a pencil, he made a crooked stroke, ruining the book!

Zhang Yi, who had been eating fruits, flew into a rage when she saw Gu Qi’s words. She had thought that Gu Qi had recovered, but he was still clueless “What the hell are you writing? Did you do it on purpose? You even ruined the notebook!”

Gu Qi stood in front of the coffee table and lowered his head in silence.

Zhang Yi grew even angrier. “Were you pretending to be obedient just now? I thought you had improved. I didn’t expect a retard to be a retard. No wonder so many teachers couldn’t teach you. If I’m not wrong, your mother must be a retard. Otherwise, how could she have given birth to a retard like you?”

The more Zhang Yi spoke, the angrier she became. She casually tore the notebook into shreds and roared, “You don’t even know how to write a word now. How do you want me to report to your father? You fool! I really don’t know how a retard like your mother can be with your father.”

......

When Gu Qi heard Zhang Yi’s words, his pupils dilated and his eyes turned red.

No!

Mom wasn’t a retard!

Mom must be very smart!

Mom must be the best mother in the world!

Zhang Yi sensed a change in Gu Qi and sneered. “Little fool, so you understand what I’m saying.”

Gu Qi bit his lip and lowered his head, suppressing his tears. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

This was the first time Zhang Yi had seen Gu Qi look so aggrieved. She said deliberately, “So you’re upset. I thought you were a block of wood who didn’t know anything. I really don’t understand. Your father is so handsome and smart. How did he give birth to a child who doesn’t know how to speak or learn? No matter how I think about it, it must be because your mother’s stupid genes were passed down to you. That’s why you’re so stupid!”

Gu Qi’s hand, which was holding the pencil, was trembling!

“Don’t worry. When I become your stepmother and give birth to a smart child, you’ll be an unwanted burden! Why are you looking at me? I told you to write. Write well. If you don’t, I’ll hit your palms and buttocks with your pencil later!”

Little Qi looked at Zhang Yi unhappily and threw the pencil aside.

Zhang Yi’s face turned green with anger. She immediately stood up, took the pencil, and pointed it at Gu Qi’s face. She roared, “Hand or butt? Choose for yourself!”

Gu Qi hesitated for a moment. From the corner of his eye, he glanced at the closed door and silently extended his hand.

“Idiot! I’m so angry!” Zhang Yi raised the pencil in his hand and was about to hit Gu Qi’s palm!

Bang!

With a loud bang, the door opened!

Zhang Yi turned his head and saw Gu Zhou’s cold face. His eyes seemed to want to swallow her alive.

Zhang Yi was so shocked that the pencil fell to the ground.
