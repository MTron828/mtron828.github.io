Chapter 689: Confession

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian’s heart began to race. She stared unblinkingly at Gu Zhou. Thinking of how the two of them had just kissed in the bathtub, she couldn’t help but blush.

If she continued to stay here, she might not be able to sleep tonight because of her nervousness. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“I… Ah!”

Before Qiao Nian could finish speaking, the man bent down slightly and picked her up in his arms. He walked towards the bed.

“Put me down quickly!” Qiao Nian said with a red face. She wanted to push Gu Zhou away, but she was afraid of hurting him.

As soon as she finished speaking, she was placed on the bed. Immediately after, Gu Zhou lay down as well, trapping her in his arms.

This position was too ambiguous.

Qiao Nian reached out to push Gu Zhou away, but Gu Zhou hugged her even tighter. The fragrance of shower gel wafted into her nose.

What had just happened in the bathroom flashed through her mind.

Qiao Nian’s body stiffened. She didn’t dare to move. Her mind raced as she thought about how to leave this room.

If it really didn’t work out, should she kick Gu Zhou off the bed or throw him over her shoulder so that he would lie obediently on the bed?

Just as Qiao Nian was about to make a move, she heard Gu Zhou’s long and even breathing, as if he was preparing to sleep.

But Qiao Nian couldn’t sleep.

If it were Zhou Zhou now, she might really be lustful.

Qiao Nian took a deep breath and remained motionless. She didn’t dare to look up at Gu Zhou, afraid that she would wake him up.

The places their bodies touched grew hotter and hotter, and Qiao Nian’s face grew redder and redder.

After hesitating for a long time, Qiao Nian carefully tried to remove Gu Zhou’s hand. Even if she didn’t leave this place, she couldn’t be so close to Gu Zhou.

Qiao Nian had just moved when she heard Gu Zhou say, “There’s something I wanted to tell you in advance.”

His voice was as low as ever, and his words carried a tone of negotiation.

Hearing Gu Zhou talk about serious matters, Qiao Nian’s messy thoughts instantly disappeared. Puzzled, she asked, “What’s wrong?”

“We’ll pay our respects to the eldest daughter of the Lu family tomorrow. I think there’s something you should know.” At this point, Gu Zhou pursed his lips slightly and looked down at the woman in his arms.

The tip of his nose was filled with the fragrance of the woman’s hair.

Gu Zhou couldn’t help but sniff twice mor.

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she was a little surprised. When she heard others mention the anniversary of her death, she had a strange feeling.

Qiao Nian looked up slightly and inadvertently met Gu Zhou’s dark eyes. She was looking forward to what Gu Zhou wanted to say to her.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian quietly, his expression hesitant. He didn’t know what to say.

Seeing that Gu Zhou was silent, Qiao Nian was about to push him away and move to the side when she heard Gu Zhou speak.

“Don’t move!”

The man’s voice was low and hoarse, with a hint of bewitchment, as if he was holding back something.

When Qiao Nian heard his words, she obediently lay on the bed and didn’t move.

“The name of the eldest daughter of the Lu family is similar to yours. Both have the word ‘Nian’,” Gu Zhou said softly.

Hearing Gu Zhou’s words, Qiao Nian’s thoughts couldn’t help but wander.

She wasn’t sure how she got her name. What she was most worried and afraid of now was that the person who had given her the name was related to the person who had kidnapped her more than twenty years ago.

If that person knew that she was the eldest daughter of the Lu family, why would he let her off?

Or was that person preparing another scheme?

If that was the case, then she was in the open while the enemy was in the dark.

When she went to the Lu family tomorrow, she would observe the other members of the Lu family first. Perhaps she could find some clues.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian was filled with anticipation for the trip to the Lu family tomorrow.

She really hoped that she could find the person who had kidnapped her more than twenty years ago as soon as possible. That way, she could go home early.

“The Gu and Lu families are especially close. The elders of the two families were once comrades. In order to maintain the relationship between the two families, the two families were preparing to marry.”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she was stunned. She had never expected him to take the initiative to mention this.

“The marriage was between me and the eldest daughter of the Lu family, Lu Nian. She’s my original fiancée.”
