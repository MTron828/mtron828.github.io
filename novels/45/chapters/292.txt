Chapter 293: Ordinary Happiness

Would Qiao Nian really not have diarrhea after eating this?

A trace of suspicion flashed in Gu Zhou’s eyes.

At this moment, the lady boss walked over with her three-year-old son in her arms.

Gu Zhou’s gaze inadvertently fell on the child’s face, and his dark eyes deepened.

Naturally, the lady boss did not notice Gu Zhou’s gaze. Her gaze fell on the busy boss’s face. She frowned and said, “Help your son buy some milk powder later. I’ll help you look after the shop.”

“Alright, give me a moment.” The man nodded.

The lady boss’s gaze fell on the man’s face. She looked at him for a few seconds, then took out a tissue from her bag and wiped the boss’s sweat. Her heart ached as she said, “Let’s buy an air conditioner in the shop too!”

“There’s no need. There’s no air-conditioning needed in the shop. Why waste this money?” The boss frowned and glared at the lady boss.

“A second-hand air conditioner won’t cost much,” the lady boss said.

“That’s still money. Our small fan can still be used. I’ll just use the fan in the shop. You can just turn on the air conditioner at home,” the boss said disapprovingly.

A trace of worry flashed in the lady boss’s eyes. She said, “Then shall we sleep in the same room tonight?”

The boss frowned and said unhappily, “No, no, I can’t sleep with you. My snoring is so loud that it will shake the heavens. When the time comes, neither you nor the child will be able to sleep well. Go to the side and stay there. Don’t interfere with my work!”

The lady boss felt a little helpless when she heard the boss’s words. She sighed and carried the child to the side.

Seeing this, Qiao Nian suddenly fell into a daze.

Although the boss didn’t look well and his voice wasn’t gentle, every word he said was for the sake of his wife and son. This was the responsibility of a father.

This was ordinary happiness.

Qiao Nian turned to look at Gu Zhou. She saw that he had been staring blankly at the child in the lady boss’s arms.

Gu Zhou kept staring at the child?

Could it be that Gu Zhou liked children very much?

Qiao Nian had always felt that she knew Gu Zhou very well, but at this moment, she couldn’t read his emotions.

The child also sensed that Gu Zhou was staring at him. He looked up at Gu Zhou and said in a childish voice, “Uncle, the duck neck costs 30 yuan a catty. It’s really delicious.”

When the boss and lady boss heard the child’s words, they instantly laughed. Their eyes sparkled with happiness!

Gu Zhou pursed his lips and turned to look at Chen Qing. He took the duck neck and left with Qiao Nian.

Chen Qing walked over and took out a hundred-dollar bill from his wallet. He handed it to the boss and said, “Keep the change!”

When the boss heard Chen Qing’s words, he was a little flattered. He said fearfully, “How can that be?”

“This is the deposit Mr. Gu gave you. From now on, you have to send 100 yuan worth of duck neck to the Gu family villa every day. We will reimburse you for the travel expenses. Most importantly, the ingredients have to be very clean!”

When the boss heard Chen Qing’s words, his eyes lit up. He hurriedly nodded and said, “Okay, okay!”

Only then did Chen Qing leave, keeping up with Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian.

In the car.

Qiao Nian looked at the duck neck in her hand and she was in an extremely good mood.

Gu Zhou stared at the duck neck and asked, “Aren’t you eating it now?”

“I’ll eat it when we get home. It’ll make the car smell bad,” Qiao Nian explained simply.
