Qiao Nian walked to the kitchen and carefully examined all the utensils there. She was worried that some of the utensils might have been soaked in safflower solution as well.

After Qiao Nian had made sure that all of them were clean, she got ready to head to the medicinal room to prepare some herbs for Grandma. Just as she turned around, she accidentally bumped into someone.

Startled, she instinctively stepped backwards. However, she stumbled over a small stool next to her, falling backwards uncontrollably.

Qiao Nian quickly shut her eyes, bracing herself for the impact. However, the expected pain from the impact did not arrive.

She opened her eyes and saw Gu Zhou standing in front of her. He had already secured an arm around her waist.

Gu Zhou’s arm flexed. In one swift motion, he pulled Qiao Nian towards him.

Qiao Nian found herself falling clumsily into Gu Zhou’s arms. Her ear was pressed against his chest.

His heartbeat echoed clearly in her ears. She could smell the faint aroma of medicine from his body.

Qiao Nian’s ears turned red without her permission. Hurriedly, she pushed Gu Zhou away and lowered her gaze. Pursing her lips, she asked, “Aren’t you going to stand guard by Grandma’s door?”

Gu Zhou straightened his clothes. Immediately, he glimpsed a red lipstick stain on his white shirt. He looked up and saw that Qiao Nian’s lipstick was slightly smudged. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Extending a hand, he gently touched the corner of Qiao Nian’s mouth with his thumb. His movements were exceedingly gentle, as if he was terrified of hurting her.

Qiao Nian’s heart began to race as she looked up at Gu Zhou. Suddenly, the memory of that night five years ago flashed into her mind.

The man had caressed the corner of her mouth like this, too.

Their actions were practically identical.

Qiao Nian stared at Gu Zhou, frozen. After a moment, she ducked away, avoiding his hand. She tucked her hair behind her ear awkwardly and said, “I’m going to make some porridge for Grandma.”

“Thank you for today.” At this moment, Gu Zhou was wholly certain that Qiao Nian had nothing to do with those people. If she had, he guessed that he would have died under her silver needles by now.

“That…” Qiao Nian pursed her lips and looked up at Gu Zhou. “She’s my grandmother now. It’s only right that I save her. You don’t have to thank me specially.”

With that, Qiao Nian walked towards the medicinal room.

She was worried that others would retrieve the wrong medicinal ingredients, so she decided to retrieve the herbs herself. After calculating the dosage, she returned to the kitchen to prepare the medicinal porridge.

Gu Zhou remained standing at the entrance of the kitchen. He watched as the kitchen bustled with activity. Steam rose from the pots on the stove, curling in the air. Gu Zhou felt an indescribable warmth in his heart. That warmth seemed to adhere to his blood, flowing through his entire body.

He lowered his head slightly. His thumb was still pink from Qiao Nian’s lipstick. He couldn’t help but recalll the touch of Qiao Nian’s lips. Something in his heart began to stir.

Gu Zhou frowned, forcibly suppressing the strange feeling in his heart.

‘While Qiao Nian was making the porridge, she noticed Gu Zhou standing behind her the entire time. When the porridge was almost ready, Gu Zhou had disappeared. Only then did she heave a sigh of relief.

She was really too tired right now. She would ask the butler to bring the porridge to Matriarch Gu.

At the fifth mental hospital in An City.

Decked in haute couture, high heels, and a pair of sunglasses, Qiao Xin stepped into the mental hospital.

At this moment, the patients in the mental hospital were playing outside. Some of them were defecating in the courtyard, and some were even running around naked.

Qiao Xin frowned, her eyes filled with contempt.

However, when she thought of Qiao Nian living with these people, she felt a spark of joy.

“Second Young Mistress Qiao, this way, please!” The nurse smiled at Qiao Xin and led her to a building not far away.

Just as she reached the entrance of the building, Qiao Nian’s attending doctor, Yang Ze, walked out with a smile. “Second Young Mistress Qiao, you’re here.”

Qiao Xin walked up to Yang Ze and took off her sunglasses, displaying a sweet and polite smile. She asked, “Doctor Yang, what has my sister been doing when she lived here for the past five years?”

Qiao Xin was curious. How did Qiao Nian become the principal of An University?

Hence, she came down here to investigate.

It would be great if Qiao Nian had made a fool of herself here. Then, she could publicize Qiao Nian’s “excellence” to the Gu family.

Yang Ze thought for a while and said, “Miss Qiao would either be reading or gardening. She has never left the hospital.”

Qiao Xin’s expression faltered just a fraction. How was this possible?
