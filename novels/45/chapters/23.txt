Chapter 24: Not Holding Back

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

In this city, the Zhou family name barely held any weight. Zhou Xue often used to fool around, so her grades were not good. In the end, through the machinations of her father, she studied nursing in university and became a nurse.

In university, Zhou Xue did not study hard either. She would watch dramas and play games all day. After she graduated, she became a nurse in the best hospital only with the help of her father’s connections.

Her father continually reminded her to work hard. In the future, he expected her to marry a rich man as well.

Zhou Xue looked at the security guards standing to her left and right. She felt that her world was about to collapse. If her father knew that she had been arrested, he would definitely beat her to death.

Zhou Xue’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. She hated Qiao Nian with all her heart, and yearned to tear her to shreds. But now, her only option was to beg Qiao Nian for help.

“Sister.” Zhou Xue stepped in front of Qiao Nian shakily. With a flattering smile on her face, she said ingratiatingly, “Sister, I was in the wrong this time. You’re the bigger person; why don’t you forgive me just this once?”

The moment Zhou Xue’s words fell, the police arrived.

Qiao Nian briefly explained what had happened. The police officer gave Zhou Xue a severe dressing down, then looked at Qiao Nian and said, “Miss Qiao, regarding whether this matter should be settled privately or not… we suggest that you settle it privately. After all, this matter…”

The police were too embarrassed to say that this was likely just a misunderstanding. But when they thought about how Zhou Xue had accused Qiao Nian of stealing the black card, they realized that the black card had more than 100 million in savings.

“It’s fine if you’d like to settle it officially. After all, this matter involves a black card!” the police officer said with a serious expression. Seeing Qiao Nian looking toward him, he said tentatively, “Why don’t the two of you have a private chat? Miss Qiao can make a decision after that.”

Qiao Nian thought about Zhou Xue’s words just now and nodded. She took a seat on a chair nearby.

Zhou Xue trembled as she walked towards Qiao Nian under the policeman’s encouragement. Her mind was in a daze and all she could think about was how to get out of the situation.

“Sister.” Zhou Xue stood in front of Qiao Nian and bowed perpendicularly. Her tears of grievance fell as she said, “Sister, I was in the wrong. Please forgive me!”

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Zhou Xue’s face and her lips curved into a bright smile. “Zhou Xue, there’s no enmity between us, right?”

Zhou Xue straightened her back hesitantly and glanced at Qiao Nian’s face. She quickly lowered her gaze to hide the hatred in her eyes. “It’s all my fault!”

“I don’t want to reconcile with you,” Qiao Nian said impassively. She knew that Zhou Xue had no intention of admitting her mistake. With that, she got up and walked towards the policemen.

“Are you crazy!” Zhou Xue grabbed Qiao Nian’s arm and glared daggers at her, her eyes red-rimmed. She pursed her lips and shouted in a rage, “It’s all your fault, it’s all your fault! Why can’t you let others speak the truth?”

Qiao Nian calmly pushed Zhou Xue’s hand away, signaling for the police to take her away.

The police officers glanced toward Zhou Xue. There was a strange light in Zhou Xue’s eyes, and she seemed as though she wanted to eat Qiao Nian alive. The police officers didn’t expect this young lady to still have a face full of hatred. She simply didn’t know how to repent!

Qiao Nian watched as the police took Zhou Xue away. Then, she took her new clothes home.

On the way back, Qiao Nian saw that Old A had replied to her message. She asked curiously, “What are you busy with? It took you so long to reply!”

Soon, Old A sent a text back.

“I just got up from bed. I was playing video games, so I slept too late last night!”

Qiao Nian pursed her lips. She no longer knew what to say to Old A. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Help me investigate two people, Li Chun and Zhou Xue, especially regarding that day five years ago, plus their whereabouts after that.”

Five years ago, Qiao Nian went drinking with her good friend Li Chun in a KTV room. In the end, she got drunk and fainted!

Before Qiao Nian lost consciousness, she saw Qiao Xin pass Li Chun a sum of money. Li Chun soon disappeared from Country Z. When she was in the mental hospital, she had tried to investigate Li Chun’s whereabouts, but she found nothing.

After that, she gave up investigating Li Chun.

When she saw Zhou Xue today, the memories hidden deep in Qiao Nian’s mind were finally roused. That night, she thought she had seen Zhou Xue as well.

Her memories were a little blurry. She seemed to remember Qiao Xin and Zhou Xue entering the KTV room together, but she also seemed to remember Qiao Xin entering the room herself.

There seemed to be something wrong with her memory, which was why she wanted Old A to help her conduct the investigation.

After getting an affirmative reply from Old A, Qiao Nian turned off her phone and went to buy a car. It took her a long time to hire a taxi today, and she didn’t want to have to repeat the experience again.

Qiao Nian drove home and parked her car outside the villa. She then walked in with her new clothes.

Once she got home, she took a shower, then washed both her new clothes and old clothes. She put on her soft pajamas, and settled down to read her books on medicine.

At this moment, her phone rang. Qiao Nian looked at the caller ID and smiled.. She picked up the phone and greeted, “Teacher Liu.”
