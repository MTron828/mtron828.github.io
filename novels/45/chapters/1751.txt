Chapter 1752 - 1752 Fear

Lina had been trying her best to adjust her mental state. Usually, when she saw Mark, she pretended to be calm, but she would feel uneasy every time.

She had thought that Mark did not know about this operation, so she was just nervous.

However, Qiao Nian said that Mark knew their every move. She couldn’t help but resist, because the trauma Mark had brought her was too great.

Qiao Nian listened to Lina talk about the past and gently hugged her.

Lina’s body trembled slightly, as if she was still afraid of Mark.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qiao Nian patted Lina’s back gently. If she had known that Lina was so afraid of Mark, she wouldn’t have brought Lina over to prevent her from being hurt.

“Lina, it’s all my fault this time. If only I had told you earlier.” Qiao Nian gently pushed Lina’s shoulder away and looked at her intently.

Lina slowly raised her head. Moonlight shone in through the window, illuminating Qiao Nian’s face. She was as beautiful as a fairy. She was so sacred that no one would dare to profane her.

She looked at Qiao Nian without blinking.

Qiao Nian’s face was filled with heartache, but she still said in a low voice, “When we returned from the villa that day, it already represented our declaration of war with Mark. Mark is very powerful. I think you know very well that we’re walking on a tightrope now. Every step is very dangerous. If we’re not careful, we might be consigned to eternal damnation.”

“Even so, don’t worry. I’ll always protect you and won’t let you get hurt.” Qiao Nian finally revealed a comforting smile.

Actually, Qiao Nian could guess that Mark had set up an empty castle. At worst, he would just threaten them.

Even though she knew that it was an empty castle, Qiao Nian still came because she wanted to investigate Song Ling’s matter.

The uneasiness in Lina’s heart gradually dissipated. She understood everything Qiao Nian had said.

For so many years, her father had been dealing with Mark. Now that Mark was forcing her to marry Wright, wasn’t he using her to attack her father?

If it wasn’t for Mr. Gu and Nian Nian, she didn’t even dare to imagine what kind of situation she and her father would be in now.

Back then, she had been frightened by Mark’s gaze and had not been able to run out of the closet in time. She was not able to help her sister put on her oxygen mask. But now, she should work hard to overcome the fear in her heart, find Song Ling, and give Mark a heavy blow!

Lina took a deep breath and looked at Qiao Nian. She nodded. “Alright, let’s continue searching!”

When Qiao Nian heard Lina’s words, her eyes flickered. She hugged Lina and slowly closed her eyes. Her voice was a little choked. “Lina, you’re really very brave!”

Lina was in a much better state. The two of them continued to search the place.

This time, they were no longer sneaking around.

Since they would be discovered by Mark sooner or later, they might as well find Song Lingx quickly!

The two of them looked for each room separately. After about 10 minutes, Lina’s voice sounded!

“Nian Nian, come over quickly…”

Qiao Nian heard a tremble in Lina’s voice and quickly ran over. She followed Lina’s gaze and saw a woman lying on the ground in the room.

No, it could no longer be called a woman. To be precise, it was a corpse.

Qiao Nian looked over with a weak gaze and saw a knife in the woman’s chest. Her face was filled with ferocious pain.

This woman must have been killed with a knife.

The window was open, and the wind blew the white curtains, giving off a sinister feeling.

Lina was trembling in fear. Seeing that Qiao Nian had already walked over, she reluctantly moved over and asked carefully, “Nian Nian, is she the person you’re looking for?”

Qiao Nian lifted the corpse’s hair. His gaze landed on the woman’s face and he nodded slowly. “It’s her.”

Qiao Nian’s frown deepened. She had never expected Mark to kill Song Ling.

Mark had struck first to gain the upper hand. Mark must have been worried that they would find out something from Song Ling. That was why he killed her directly?

However, Qiao Nian felt that something was wrong.
