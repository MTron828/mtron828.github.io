Chapter 510: Song Yue’s Interrogation

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian pursed her lips, vaguely sensing the answer.

“Brother, you mean that back then, Grandma Qiao wanted me to marry Qiao Yu when I grew up? But after Grandma Qiao left, everything after that was out of Grandma Qiao’s control. The Qiao Shan couple didn’t like me, so they sent me to the mountains.”

Lu Zhu looked at Qiao Nian. His sister was indeed smart.

“I think that’s possible. Perhaps there’s another possibility. Matriarch Qiao thought that you were really the granddaughter of the Qiao family. It’s just that she saw that the Qiao couple treated you badly, so she doted on you a little more.”

Qiao Nian’s eyes were filled with confusion.

Now that Matriarch Qiao was gone, if he wanted to investigate, he could only start with the Qiao Shan couple.

He believed that there was a reason for this arrangement.

“Brother, don’t think about this for now. Rest early. When tomorrow comes…”

Before Qiao Nian could finish speaking, the door to the ward suddenly opened, interrupting her.

Qiao Nian thought that Gu Zhou had returned. She turned around, and the smile on her face gradually froze. She saw Song Yue sitting in a wheelchair.

Song Yue frowned and looked at Qiao Nian resentfully.

Qiao Nian’s expression darkened instantly. She questioned sternly, “What are you doing here?”

Worried that she would be chased out by Qiao Nian, Song Yue hurriedly said, “Qiao Nian, you’re not Brother Lu Zhu’s sister at all. What are you trying to do by pretending to be Brother Lu Zhu’s sister?!”

Lu Zhu looked at Song Yue coldly. His face instantly turned cold, and his eyes narrowed dangerously. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Just by looking at Song Yue, he felt that he had dirtied his eyes. At this moment, he wished that Song Yue would immediately disappear from his sight.

However, seeing that Lu Zhu did not speak, Song Yue felt a little uneasy, but she quickly calmed down.

Qiao Nian was just a wild girl from the countryside. She was vicious.

If Qiao Nian became the Lu family’s eldest daughter that everyone envied, she wouldn’t be Qiao Nian’s match in the future.

At that time, Qiao Nian would be close to Lu Zhu. Even if Qiao Nian was discovered to not be the eldest daughter of the Lu family, she would become the first madam of the Lu family.

The more Song Yue thought about it, the angrier she became. She clenched her fists tightly and mustered her courage to push the wheelchair into Lu Zhu’s ward.

Seeing Song Yue enter, Qiao Nian subconsciously shielded Lu Zhu behind her. She looked at Song Yue with a dark expression and asked unhappily, “Song Yue, does your face not hurt enough?”

At the mention of this, Song Yue was furious. She was the daughter of the Song family, yet she had been beaten up by the wild girl Qiao Nian.

If this got out, she would be humiliated.

Song Yue said with a dark expression, “You still have the cheek to mention this?”

Qiao Nian said disapprovingly, “Why can’t I mention this? You’re just a cripple now. I can easily defeat you!”

Cripple…

When Song Yue heard this word, the scar on her heart seemed to have been ruthlessly opened. It was so painful that she found it difficult to breathe.

If it wasn’t for Qiao Nian, how could her uterus have been removed?

All of this was thanks to Qiao Nian.

Song Yue bit her lip and said angrily, “Qiao Nian, you actually pretended to be Brother Lu Zhu’s sister. You’re too sinister. You’re just a wild girl from the countryside. How can you be Brother Lu Zhu’s sister?”

Before Qiao Nian could speak, Song Yue questioned, “Why did you get close to Brother Lu Zhu? What do you want to do to the Lu family?”

Qiao Nian’s gaze turned colder and colder. She had just told her brother not to let anyone else know about this.

She never expected Song Yue to take the initiative to jump out and hit the gun.

However, there was also a benefit to this. She wouldn’t have to worry about being schemed against by Song Yue in the future.
