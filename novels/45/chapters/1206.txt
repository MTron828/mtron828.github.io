1207 Another Dead End

Jiang Chi lowered his eyes sadly. His blue eyes were like a lake of stagnant water. His voice was low and hoarse. “This is just your side of the story. Why should I believe you?”

Mr. Chen said calmly, “You can choose to believe it. Of course, you can choose not to believe it! Whether you believe it or not, that’s the truth.”

Qiao Nian sat opposite Mr. Chen. Her gaze was fixed on his face, trying to determine if he was telling the truth or not from his expression.

According to her judgment, she felt that Mr. Chen was not lying.

Realizing this, Qiao Nian frowned. It seemed that the clues had been cut off again.

!!

Jiang Cheng had only called to mention buying medicine to Mr. Chen. Then who was the last person Jiang Cheng had seen before he died?

Jiang Chi had been in the business world for many years. Although he had never studied psychology, he could still tell from a person’s expression if he was lying.

When Mr. Chen said those words just now, he looked calm and did not seem to be lying at all.

Jiang Chi felt that something was strange, but he couldn’t put his finger on it. He looked into Mr. Chen’s eyes and seemed to see Gu Yue in a daze.

Mr. Chen retracted his gaze and took out his phone from his pocket. He casually searched through his phone a few times before handing the phone to Jiang Chi.

In the photo, Jiang Cheng was wearing a loose white t-shirt. He was holding the medicine in his hand, and Mr. Chen was standing beside him, wearing a white shirt.

From the angle of this photo, Jiang Cheng must have taken a selfie with his phone. The two of them were very close. In the photo, Jiang Cheng’s face was filled with a big smile, and Mr. Chen’s face looked very gentle.

Jiang Chi’s gaze fell on the phone screen. He gently touched Jiang Cheng’s face. His silly brother was really stupid. In order to save him, he had given up his life without hesitation.

However, what Jiang Cheng didn’t know was that he hoped that Jiang Cheng would live well. As for his life, he would leave it to fate.

Looking at this photo, Jiang Chi knew in his heart that Mr. Chen was not lying.

In the photo, Jiang Cheng clearly trusted Mr. Chen very much. The atmosphere in the photo was very harmonious, and the two of them were like old friends who had not seen each other for a long time.

Jiang Chi’s eyes were misty. He gently touched Jiang Cheng’s face. In the past, he had always been busy with his career and rarely cared about Jiang Cheng.

After Jiang Cheng left, he realized that he knew too little about him.

He only knew that Jiang Cheng liked to study medicine, but he didn’t know any of his friends, let alone the good relationship between Jiang Cheng and Mr. Chen.

If Jiang Chi remembered correctly, Jiang Cheng also smiled like this when he took photos with him in the past. This meant that Jiang Cheng really trusted Mr. Chen, just like how Jiang Cheng trusted him.

When Jiang Chi returned the phone to Mr. Chen, Gu Zhou, Qiao Nian, and Lu Jiang all saw the contents of the photo.

In the photo Lu Jiang was looking at, he seemed to see Jiang Cheng calling him “Fourth Brother” in front of him.

Mr. Chen retracted his phone and said with a slight frown, “I bought a plane ticket for him that day. It was from An City to Nancheng.”

Nancheng?

Mr. Chen’s words were like a bomb, stunning the other four.

One had to know that Jiang Cheng’s corpse had been found in An City. At that time, the police had closed the case and confirmed that Jiang Cheng had died in An City.

Everyone in the room fell silent. No one spoke. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Initially, Qiao Nian had thought that Mr. Chen might know a lot of things. She had wanted to ask him if he knew her background.

However, according to Mr. Chen, not only did Mr. Chen have nothing to do with Jiang Cheng’s death, but he was also a good friend of Jiang Cheng.

In that case, Jiang Cheng’s death shouldn’t have anything to do with Mr. Chen. Everything was back to square one.
