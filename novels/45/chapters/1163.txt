Auntie Cao could also see the hesitation in Song Yu’s eyes. A trace of disdain flashed in her eyes as she shook her head. “Sixth Miss, you’re not a child. You’ve been in the entertainment industry for so long. Don’t you understand what I’m saying?”

Song Yu clenched her fists tightly and stood rooted to the ground with her head lowered.

“Old Master and Madam treat you very well. But what if Fifth Miss insists that they send you away? You’ve been in the entertainment industry for so long. You should believe that benefits run the world. Moreover, Fifth Miss has just returned. Old Master and Madam want to make it up to her wholeheartedly. Whether she wants the stars or the moon, Old Master and Madam will definitely agree. If Fifth Miss asks you to leave, I think they’ll definitely agree!”

“Auntie Cao, stop talking. I know what to do. Don’t target Sister again!” Song Yu said coldly. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Auntie Cao gave Song Yu a meaningful look. She knew that Song Yu had already taken her words to heart.

Song Yu looked at the ancestral hall in the distance. Just by looking through the window, she could feel the warmth and harmony inside. A trace of envy flashed in her eyes.

She wanted to be punished with her brothers and sisters, but Auntie Cao’s appearance had ruined everything. She couldn’t be punished with everyone else.

Song Yu’s eyes were filled with loneliness, but she couldn’t go back now.

Auntie Cao could see the loneliness in Song Yu’s eyes. Her lips curved up slightly as she comforted her. “Sixth Miss, it’s getting late. You should go back and rest early too!”

Song Yu nodded. She could only return to her room to sleep now.

Auntie Cao watched as Song Yu left. Her eyes gradually became firm, and she pursed his lips tightly before walking towards her room.

In the ancestral hall.

Qiao Nian knelt on the ground with her brothers. She turned to look at them and couldn’t help but sigh.

Her mother was really amazing. She had actually given birth to so many children!

If her brothers accidentally gave birth to triplets when they got married, this ancestral hall would be too small to accommodate so many people!

Triplets

A trace of loneliness flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes. It was as if a huge rock was pressing down on her chest, making her unable to breathe.

She still had one child she hadn’t found, and she didn’t know where that child was now. She clenched her fists tightly. No matter what the price, she had to find her child.

Those people were really sinister and cunning. They almost ruined her life and Gu Qi and Xiao Shi’s childhood.

She was very worried that her third child’s childhood would be ruined by those people!

Actually, what she was most worried about was what would happen if that child was no longer alive.

Qiao Nian hurriedly threw that terrifying thought to the back of her mind. She didn’t dare to think about such a terrifying thing.

Lu Qi knelt beside Qiao Nian. Sensing that something was wrong with Qiao Nian’s emotions, she looked at her worriedly and asked softly, “Sister, are you feeling unwell somewhere? Are you sad because of Auntie Cao’s words? Don’t take it to heart. You’re the best sister in the world. You’re the pride of our entire family!”

Qiao Nian met Lu Qi’s worried gaze and shook her head gently. “No, I’m just very happy to have a family in the future!”

Lu Qi was innocent and did not think too much about it. She smiled and nodded. “Sister, no matter what happens in the future, you can tell us. We’re all family!”

Qiao Nian smiled and nodded. She lowered her head and continued thinking about the children.

Other than Fourth Brother and Lu Qi, who had inadvertently seen Xiao Shi, the other brothers did not know that she had already given birth!

Although she and her brother had acknowledged each other first, her brothers didn’t know that she had children either. She didn’t say this because she didn’t want her family to worry about her.

At that time, when Big Brother found out about what happened between her and Gu Zhou six years ago, he almost turned against Gu Zhou.

If everyone in the family knew about what happened six years ago, would they be especially worried about her? Would they dislike Gu Zhou even more?

Actually, the matter was already in the past. She didn’t care about what had happened back then either, but according to how much her family doted on her, Gu Zhou would definitely suffer again!
