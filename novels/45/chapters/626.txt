“Sure, I want to see her too. When the time comes, I’ll have to thank her for taking care of you.” As Xu Xin spoke, she opened the calendar on her phone and glanced at the time, wondering when she should return to the country.

Gu Qi looked much more lively than before.

She hoped that Gu Qi would always grow up happily.

Previously, when she was with Gu Qi, he was only willing to talk to her.

When she left, she was still a little worried that Gu Qi might lose his ability to communicate with others in the future. That was why she often called him.

“Auntie Xu, when will you be back?” Gu Qi couldn’t wait to see Xu Xin.

In his impression, only Xu Xin had treated him the best in the past.

When Xu Xin heard Gu Qi’s words, her expression darkened slightly. She smiled and said, “I’ve been a little busy with my studies recently. I’ll call you when I have time, okay?”

“Okay.”

After Gu Qi hung up, his mood improved even more. When he thought about how Auntie Nian Nian would always be by his side in the future, his lips curved up involuntarily.

Qiao Nian returned to her room. Sitting in front of her computer, she carefully read up on information regarding multiple personalities.

Multiple personalities actually meant that a person had two or more independent personality states. Moreover, those personalities all had their own sense of self and unique personalities. Usually, when one’s personality state changed, one would suffer from amnesia.

This was why every time Gu Zhou changed his personality, he would forget what happened when the other personalities appeared.

It was said on the Internet that multiple personality disorder was usually focused on psychological treatment. Then, other drugs were used to assist the patient.

Moreover, the patient had to have enough trust in that doctor and establish a very good doctor-patient relationship. Only by actively cooperating with the treatment would he be able to recover earlier.

When Qiao Nian saw the last post, she frowned.

It would probably be very difficult for Gu Zhou to build enough trust with a psychiatrist, because Gu Zhou was already very guarded. Moreover, she heard from her eldest brother that Gu Zhou did not think that he was mentally ill at all, much less willing to see a psychiatrist.

In order to treat Gu Zhou’s illness, Qiao Nian decided to learn psychology herself.

Qiao Nian downloaded a few e-books online. While she was studying, there was a knock on the door.

Qiao Nian hurriedly closed all the web pages she had just browsed. Only then did she look towards the door and say, “Come in!”

The door was pushed open. Standing outside was the servant who had been taking care of Matriarch Gu.

“Miss Qiao, Matriarch Gu invites you to her study now!” The servant said respectfully.

“Alright, I understand. Go ahead!”

Qiao Nian waited for the servant to leave. After clearing away all the content on the computer, she walked out. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

She walked to Matriarch Gu’s study and knocked on the door. “Grandma.”

“Come in!”

Matriarch Gu’s voice came from inside the room.

Qiao Nian pushed the door open and walked in. She saw Matriarch Gu sitting on the sofa beside the French window.

“Nian Nian, come and sit down!” Matriarch Gu looked at Qiao Nian lovingly.

Qiao Nian walked over and sat down beside Matriarch Gu.

Matriarch Gu grabbed Qiao Nian’s hand and asked softly, “Nian Nian, do you still remember Matriarch Lu?”

Qiao Nian’s eyes lit up, but quickly dimmed.

How could she not remember?

Matriarch Lu was her biological grandmother. How could she have forgotten?

Qiao Nian didn’t know why Matriarch Gu would mention Matriarch Lu again. She nodded and said, “I remember.”

Matriarch Gu sighed softly, her eyes filled with sadness. She said softly, “In a few days, it will be the anniversary of the death of the eldest daughter of the Lu family. Last time, she thought that the blessing bag you embroidered looked very good, so she wanted you to embroider another blessing bag for that poor girl.”

Qiao Nian’s eyes flashed with embarrassment. She frowned slightly. Before she could speak, she heard Matriarch Gu speak again.

“That poor girl has been gone for so many years. I wonder if she has been reincarnated. How is she doing now? How pitiful!”
