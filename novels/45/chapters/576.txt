Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

When Qiao Nian heard footsteps, her body trembled even more violently. She covered her head desperately, as if this was the only way to avoid being discovered.

Gu Zhou could clearly hear Qiao Nian’s heavy breathing. With every breath she took, her grip on her head seemed to tighten.

He could feel her pain, because he had experienced this before.

His eyes darkened as he recalled his past self. When he had a relapse, Qiao Nian was able to pull him out of the darkness.

However, when Qiao Nian fell ill, no one could save her.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian with heartache. Carefully, he draped the coat over Qiao Nian again.

He only hoped that she would wake up soon.

Qiao Nian hugged her head tightly. She felt as if she were in a cellar, shivering from the cold but unable to break free.

At this moment, a warmth enveloped her entire body. Her world gradually warmed up.

Her grip on her head gradually loosened. She took a deep breath, and the suffocating feeling of despair gradually disappeared. Everything became comfortable.

She gradually sat up straight. On her right was An City in the dark, and on her left was the light from the long corridor of the villa.

The corridor was white in color, making one feel as if they had walked into a bright world.

“Are you feeling better?”

The male voice coming from the side stunned Qiao Nian slightly. Her heart jumped to her throat, and she instantly raised her mental defenses, crossing her arms over her chest.

“It’s me, Gu Zhou.” Gu Zhou looked into Qiao Nian’s deer-like eyes. A trace of guilt flashed in his eyes, and his face turned pale. “I’m sorry, I didn’t know you were afraid of the dark.”

He knew in his heart that Qiao Nian wasn’t afraid of the dark. Instead, she had been traumatized in a dark place.

The reason he said that was because he didn’t want to burden her too much or think that he had discovered something.

Qiao Nian gradually lowered her hands and her gaze. She gradually realized that this wasn’t the night she had been bullied five years ago.

Seeing that Qiao Nian was responding, Gu Zhou hugged her.

This time, Qiao Nian behaved and didn’t push Gu Zhou away.

Qiao Nian was enveloped in warmth, and the coldness in her heart gradually dissipated. She began to respond to Gu Zhou with both hands, raising her head slightly. Inadvertently, her lips brushed against Gu Zhou’s Adam’s apple.

She could feel the man hugging her tense up. Even his breathing became erratic.

Qiao Nian recalled how Gu Zhou had brought tanks to look for her back in MY, forcing Jiang Chi to let her and Lu Zhu live. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

At that time, although he looked tired, he stood by her side like a savior.

“Gu Zhou…” Qiao Nian hugged Gu Zhou’s back tightly. Her beautiful fox-like eyes gradually filled with charm. She looked up at Gu Zhou, her uneasiness gradually calming down.

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s voice, he was slightly stunned. Her voice was completely different from before. It was charming and soft, like a feather brushing past his heart. It was itchy, and he couldn’t stop himself.

His eyes gradually darkened as he looked at Qiao Nian with an unfathomable expression.

Logically speaking, Qiao Nian should have woken up by now. She wasn’t supposed to look like a seductive little fox.

Qiao Nian’s hands gradually retracted, moving up his chest. She cupped Gu Zhou’s face with both hands, gradually taking the initiative. Without hesitation, her lips kissed Gu Zhou’s.

Her hands were like snakes, gently sliding across his face and back.

Gu Zhou opened his eyes and happened to see Qiao Nian’s infatuated expression.

It wasn’t pleasure, but indulgence. She wanted to use reality to crush her nightmares.

What exactly had she experienced?
