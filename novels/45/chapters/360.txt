Chapter 361: Biased

Zhang Lei felt that this matter was a little serious. He hurriedly took out the list in his hand and his gaze fell on the last item.

Stone Wall Painting!

When everyone in the banquet hall saw Zhang Lei’s expression, they could already guess what was going on.

Song Yu frowned slightly. She had a bad feeling about this.

Zhang Lei, who was standing on stage, looked at Qiao Nian and asked, “Miss Qiao, how did you know?”

Although everyone had a tacit understanding, they were still a little surprised to hear Zhang Lei ask it himself.

Qiao Nian stood there calmly, enunciating each word clearly. “I was the one who brought the stone wall painting over. Moreover, Mr. Qin and I have already discussed it. This painting will be the finale item.”

When Song Yu heard Qiao Nian’s words, her face turned pale. She couldn’t believe that her painting was a fake. However, seeing Qiao Nian’s confident expression, she felt a little uncertain… Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Qiao Xin, who was standing not far away, frowned.

Qiao Xin wasn’t a fool. She had fallen many times in front of Qiao Nian in the past, and she understood one thing.

...

If Qiao Nian wasn’t completely confident, she would never spout nonsense on such an occasion.

Qiao Xin clenched her fists involuntarily.

It was because of this that she felt extremely indignant.

Qiao Nian was a wild girl who had grown up in the countryside. How did she get her hands on the stone wall painting?

Qin Lu stood there obediently, her face extremely pale. She still remembered losing her job at the kindergarten because Qiao Nian had called Qin Chuan.

Qin Lu didn’t dare to voice her doubts, but she didn’t get along with Qiao Nian. She couldn’t help but speak up. “Since you said that your item is the finale item, why did it appear as the second item? Why didn’t the host discover anything wrong? Could it be that everything was arranged?”

Qin Lu’s words were directed at Zhang Lei.

The doubt in her words spoke for itself.

Even though Zhang Lei had hosted so many programs, he was still sweating profusely.

He raised his hand to wipe his sweat. How could he make such a lowly mistake in such a grand auction? If word of this got out, he would never be able to be a host for the rest of his life.

Fortunately, Zhang Lei was experienced. He quickly calmed down and explained, “Which item will appear in this auction? Whether there are any repetitions is not within my jurisdiction. Moreover, this stone wall painting is covered by a red cloth. Before the red cloth is lifted, I, like everyone else, don’t know what item is inside.”

Hearing Zhang Lei’s words, everyone instantly understood.

The reason for the appearance of this stone wall painting was because this item had been auctioned as a mysterious treasure.

The person who brought the stone wall painting was Song Yu.

Song Yu was a member of the Lu family, and she was an international celebrity. How could she take out a fake at such an auction to ruin her popularity?

Everyone’s gaze gradually fell on Song Yu.

Song Yu had graduated from An City Film Academy. Her acting skills were considered outstanding among modern young actresses.

She quickly regained her composure. A faint smile appeared on her lips, and the dimples on her cheeks appeared. She turned to look at Qiao Nian and asked seriously, “Miss Qiao, why are you so sure that there’s something wrong with my painting and not yours?”

Many people in the banquet hall were fans of Song Yu.

Song Yu starred as the female lead in many of her dramas, and what she said made one subconsciously believe her.

The fans could no longer sit still. They spoke up to help.

“Miss Song is also very capable. How could she use a fake to fool everyone?”

“Miss Song has always been passionate about charity. Moreover, she has donated to three schools in the poor mountains.”
