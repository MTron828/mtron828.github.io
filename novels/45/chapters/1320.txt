1321 Comfort?

Chen Quan and Chang Feng both started at the underground casino. The two of them had always been inseparable. The two of them often whispered to each other. Could the two of them be a couple?

Cui Huai’s gaze changed a few times. Then, he stood up and comforted her. “Chang Feng should be fine. Don’t worry.”

Chen Quan felt that Cui Huai’s gaze was a little strange, so he didn’t think too much about it. He nodded. Seeing that Cui Huai was about to leave, he asked politely, “Mr. Cui, are you tired? Why don’t I get someone to tidy up a guest room?”

“There’s no need. I still have a lot of things to do tonight.” Cui Huai waved his hand and said tiredly, “Gu Zhou has captured Cui Yong. Coupled with the people Gu Zhou has captured previously, I wonder how much information Dao Wen has leaked to Gu Zhou’s woman. I’ll spend some effort to ask around so that I can deal with it when the time comes.”

“Mr. Cui, take care!” Mr. Chen looked at Cui Huai and said politely.

Cui Huai nodded and gently patted Mr. Chen’s shoulder. He said meaningfully, “I’ll get someone to give you the Tang Sancai later.”

Cui Huai knew that Chen Quan’s cultural standards were not high, but he especially liked to collect antiques. This could be considered compensation for Chen Quan.

“Thank you,” Chen Quan said with a smile.

Cui Huai turned around and left majestically with the group. Sha He left with him.

Mr. Chen watched them until they reached the entrance of the villa, then turned around and walked in.

Cui Huai was sitting in the car, while Sha He was sitting in the front passenger seat, looking down and fiddling with his gun.

Cui Huai looked up at Sha He and asked, “What exactly is the relationship between Dao Wen and Qiao Nian?”

Sha He immediately put away his gun and turned to look at Cui Huai. With a serious expression, he said, “Mr. Cui, I think the two of them really look like a couple. I heard that Gu Zhou has an aversion to women. The reason why he told outsiders that Qiao Nian is his wife should be to hide his aversion to women.”

Cui Huai looked thoughtful. He had long known that Gu Zhou had an aversion to women, so he had not planted a woman by Gu Zhou’s side previously.

Qiao Nian, this woman who had appeared out of thin air and Gu Zhou called her his wife.

He had asked a doctor. After a doctor’s treatment, the symptoms of aversion to women might ease a little, but it was impossible for Gu Zhou to have a substantive relationship with Qiao Nian directly.

Sha He didn’t know what Cui Huai was thinking. He continued, “I heard that Qiao Nian is a doctor. Her medical skills are not bad. Previously, Qiao Nian moved into the Gu family villa to treat Gu Zhou’s illness.”

“Looks like Qiao Nian’s medical skills are really good. Otherwise, Gu Zhou would have been lying in a coffin long ago,” Cui Huai said sarcastically.

“It’s rumored that Qiao Nian’s medical skills are not bad. I’m not sure about the details.” Sha He continued, “It’s obvious that Gu Zhou’s child is five or six years old. Qiao Nian actually doesn’t despise that child. This can only mean one thing. Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou aren’t really husband and wife. If they are, Qiao Nian will definitely fall out with Gu Zhou because of the child!”

“Yes.” Cui Huai nodded in agreement. He would be just like that old woman in his family. Even if he had many women outside, the old woman didn’t care as long as he didn’t bring those women home or those illegitimate children home.

Sha He sighed and said helplessly, “I never expected Dao Wen to be a traitor. If it weren’t for him, we wouldn’t have lost so many brothers.”

Cui Huai’s eyes turned cold. His voice was as cold as a demon from hell. “Gu Zhou’s move is really too high level. Not only did he make Chen Quan and me go against each other, but he also asked the Interpol to keep an eye on me!”

Sha He no longer dared to reply.

Cui Huai turned to look at the scenery outside and said in a low voice, “I just hope we’re safe.”

What satisfied Cui Huai the most was Chen Quan’s answer tonight. Chen Quan had no intention of replacing him.

Cui Huai felt that he had been brainwashed by Dao Wen previously. In a daze, he thought that Chen Quan would replace him. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

However, Chen Quan’s words reminded him that he was a fighter, not a white-collar worker. He didn’t know anything about the company’s business. Even if Chen Quan was smart, he only knew how to guess people’s hearts.

However, the company’s business needed someone to handle serious matters. Chen Quan was not qualified at all.
