Chapter 465: Politeness Before Force

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Lu Zhu had blocked a bullet for her!

Gu Zhou had driven a tank to save her!

Jiang Chi became even more curious about Qiao Nian’s identity.

Jiang Wen, who was standing at the side, was a little anxious.

If it was only the Qin family and the Lu family, the Jiang family could fight them. However, if the Gu family came too, they really wouldn’t be able to take it!

Was the Jiang family’s foundation going to be destroyed?

Jiang Wen looked at Jiang Chi worriedly. “Master Jiang.”

“Everyone who comes is a guest. Let’s go take a look at the second young master of the Gu family!” Jiang Chi’s lips curled into a cunning smile.

Qiao Nian finally understood that Jiang Chi was definitely a ruthless person. Perhaps he wasn’t afraid of dying together.

When Qiao Nian saw that Jiang Chi was about to leave, she called out, “Jiang Chi!”

Jiang Chi turned to look at Qiao Nian, his blue eyes flashing with anticipation.

There was a hint of gentleness in Qiao Nian’s voice. “Jiang Chi, I really won’t lie to you again. When I get back, I’ll definitely investigate and give your brother an explanation. I definitely won’t be biased to my family!”

Jiang Chi looked at Qiao Nian calmly. Just now, he had noticed that when Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s name, her eyes instantly softened. His phoenix eyes narrowed slightly as he asked, “Are you more worried about Lu Zhu or Gu Zhou?”

When Qiao Nian heard Jiang Chi’s question, she was stunned.

For a moment, Qiao Nian didn’t know how to answer.

Qiao Nian’s thoughts were simple. She didn’t want anyone to be hurt, much less Lu Zhu and Gu Zhou.

Jiang Chi’s question seemed to have another meaning. However, she did not have time to think about it now.

Qiao Nian looked at Jiang Chi firmly and said word by word, “This time, I won’t lie to you!”

Jiang Chi gave Qiao Nian a meaningful look before turning to leave.

Jiang Chi’s blue eyes were filled with gloom.

Jiang Chi was not in love, nor did he believe in nonsense like love at first sight.

However, he did not expect such a thing to happen to him.

Perhaps if another woman had said those words to him, he might have killed her without hesitation. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

However, he couldn’t help but want to believe everything she said just because that woman was Qiao Nian, .

Just now, when he had planned to see Gu Zhou, Qiao Nian had revealed a hint of gentleness.

From the looks of it, Qiao Nian cared a lot about Gu Zhou.

Then why had Qiao Nian risked everything to save Lu Zhu?

Was Qiao Nian’s relationship with Lu Zhu really that simple?

At this moment, outside the palace.

Jiang Chi glanced around and saw dozens of tanks around him.

Meanwhile, Gu Zhou was sitting on the largest tank. His expression was a little sinister, and his entire body emitted a cold aura, like the God of Death.

Jiang Chi felt that the title of Black Hell King should be given to Gu Zhou.

When Chen Qing received Qiao Nian’s call, he had flown over from the north with Gu Zhou as quickly as possible.

Moreover, Chen Qing had gathered all the Gu family’s forces in MY in a short period of time.

They had to save Lu Zhu and Qiao Nian today!

There were more people here at night than in An City, but the people on standby did not dare to slack off at all.

The gates of the ghost town opened slowly.

Jiang Chi walked out calmly, followed by Jiang Wen and four other mercenaries.

Gu Zhou nimbly jumped down from the tank. His dark eyes stared fixedly at Jiang Chi, and he stood with his hands behind his back, looking arrogant.

The pressure emanating from Gu Zhou was very strong, causing Jiang Wen and the four mercenaries’ hearts to tremble.

However, Jiang Chi was different. Under such great pressure, he stood there calmly with a smile on his lips. He asked, “Second Young Master Gu, what brings you here so late at night?”

Gu Zhou looked up at Jiang Chi and said coldly, “Mr. Jiang, a straightforward person doesn’t resort to insinuations. I’m here to pick up two of my friends. One of them is surnamed Qiao, and the other is surnamed Lu!”

Jiang Wen’s heart trembled. He looked up at Jiang Chi.
