Chapter 1643 Going Home

Mark was really good at applying what he had learned. He silenced the president with what Qiao Nian had just said, leaving him speechless.

The wind grew stronger and stronger, and the president's eyes instantly darkened. He looked at Mark coldly and said calmly, "I'll consider this matter carefully. We'll talk about it later."

The president turned to leave. He seemed to have thought of something and turned to look at the two people standing there. He said coldly, "If the dignity of the royal family needs to be maintained by marriage, don't you think it's very sad?"

He paused and looked at Wright, enunciating each word clearly. "Do you really like Lina?"

When Wright heard the president's words, he immediately nodded and said, "Yes, Mr. President. I'll definitely treat Lina well. I'll take care of her for the rest of my life and be a good husband."

"Is that so?" The President slowly turned around and stared unblinkingly at Wright. He questioned, "Why didn't you look sad at all when Annie was basically sentenced to death? Or did you have no heart from the beginning?"

Wright's expression changed slightly. He looked at the president in disbelief.

Why was the president different from before?

Mark walked towards the president, blocking his view of Wright. He said gently, "My dear brother, I know you might not believe Wright. I think you can believe me."

As Mark spoke, he placed his hand on the president's shoulder and gradually exerted strength, as if he wanted to crush it. His tone was as gentle as ever, but the threat in his words was obvious. "I will definitely treat Lina like my daughter. I won't let her suffer at all."

The president's eyes were cold as his gaze fell on Mark's face. He raised his hand to remove Mark's hand, his eyes cold.

Treat her like her own daughter?

Did he want his Lina to end up like Annie?

If Lina really liked Wright, she would definitely tell him about this.

It seemed that Lina really didn't like Wright at all.

The president walked coldly towards his car.

Mark looked at the president's back and said in a low voice, "I hope you'll give us an answer as soon as possible. Something bad like this actually happened to the royal family. Good things need to happen soon."

After the President got into the car, he sat there with a cold expression and looked out of the window at Mark and Wright. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Mark and Wright stood there with smiles on their faces, as if they already knew that he would agree to this.

Seeing the president's car leave, Mark got into his car. As soon as he got in, his expression instantly darkened.

Wright, who was sitting beside Mark, was also so frightened that he didn't dare to speak.

Wright took out his phone and hurriedly sent a message to the castle, asking them to prepare everything in advance.

When he arrived at Mark's castle, he got out of the car and walked in with a dark expression.

The butler, who had been waiting at the door, hurriedly lowered his head when he saw Mark's dark expression.

After Mark entered, the butler realized that his back was already cold. When he saw Wright, he quickly walked over to him and asked in a low voice, "This trial didn't go well?"

"Yes." Wright nodded, as if he had thought of something. "Be careful. Don't let anything happen."

"Yes." The butler nodded.

The butler followed Wright into the castle and saw Mark standing at the table, drinking alone.

The butler frowned. He didn't know what had happened in the court this time. Why was the Earl so angry?

Just as he was about to say something, a piercing sound came from the stairs not far away.

The butler looked up and saw that the servant had accidentally broken a photo frame. He immediately walked over and reprimanded sternly, "What are you doing? You can't even do a small thing well. What did you break?"

As soon as he finished speaking, he saw the servant turn pale and tremble in fear. In the next second, she knelt on the ground.

At this moment, the butler heard footsteps coming from behind. The footsteps were steady and powerful, as if every step weighed millions of kilograms.

Carefully, he turned back.
