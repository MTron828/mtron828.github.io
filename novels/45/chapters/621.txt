Chapter 622: You’ve Misunderstood

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Gu Qi frowned. He looked at Gu Zhou suspiciously and said, “If you really want a girl, you can give birth to one with her now. Then, you can have a daughter called Nian’er!”

His voice was similar as usual, with a trace of grievance in it.

When Gu Zhou heard Gu Qi’s words, his heart ached.

“Actually, you’ve misunderstood.” Gu Zhou looked at Gu Qi with heartache. Perhaps it was because of Gu Qi’s intelligence that he was sad over that nonsense. “Actually, Nian’er is your name.”

Gu Qi was slightly stunned. His eyes widened involuntarily.

His name was clearly Gu Qi. When did he call Nian’er? Why didn’t he know?

Gu Zhou touched his head. Sometimes, one really needs a white lie.

“When you were born, I thought that the woman who had lost too much blood in childbirth was your mother, so I wanted to commemorate her with your name. I once called you ‘Nian’er’ for a month or two, but then I realized something.”

At this point, Gu Zhou saw Gu Qi looking at him with sparkling eyes. His heart ached. “But I also feel that this matter is unfair to you.”

Gu Qi’s grape-like eyes suddenly flashed. He stared unblinkingly at Gu Zhou, the anticipation in his eyes obvious.

“The dead are gone, and the living remain. I shouldn’t use your name to commemorate her. No matter what, you’re her favorite baby. You should have your own life and your own happiness, so I changed your name to Gu Qi. I only found out some time ago that your mommy wasn’t dead.” Gu Zhou said so much in a row. He was a little worried that Gu Qi wouldn’t understand what he was saying.

“Is that really the case?” Gu Qi was a little touched, but also a little uncertain.

“Of course. Who else do you think Nian’er is?” Gu Zhou asked with a smile.

Although the conflict between him and Gu Qi had been resolved, he was still very curious. When he had fainted and had no memories, had something strange happened to him?

Gu Qi thought about it seriously. He felt that his father’s words made sense. Previously, he had also heard from others that some people would use their names to commemorate those from before.

No wonder Dad would call her that in his dreams. So he was thinking of Mommy!

At the thought of this, Gu Qi’s frown deepened. He asked seriously, “Dad, are you planning to get married and have children with Auntie Nian Nian?”

Gu Zhou had initially planned to tell Gu Qi about this after some time, so that Gu Qi would slowly accept Qiao Nian.

Since Gu Qi had understood everything, he did not intend to continue hiding it.

Gu Zhou looked at Gu Qi seriously and said, “Xiao Qi, I’m sorry. Dad shouldn’t have hidden this from you.”

“Do you like Auntie Nian Nian?” Gu Qi asked with a serious expression, looking like a little adult.

Gu Zhou had never thought of this question before. Now that he heard Gu Qi’s question, he pondered for a moment and nodded. “I like her.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Gu Qi broke free from Gu Zhou’s embrace and stood up silently. After thinking for a long time, he asked, “Dad, are you planning to marry Auntie Nian Nian? Then give birth to another Sister Nian’er?”

“Even if she has another child, it’s impossible for her to be called Nian’er,” Gu Zhou said solemnly.

“But Dad really likes the name Nian’er. Why can’t Sister be called Nian’er?” Gu Qi didn’t understand what Gu Zhou meant.

“If her name is Nian’er, won’t she have the same name as your aunt?” Gu Zhou asked. At this moment, he realized that Gu Qi’s logical thinking ability was very strong. He was not inferior to an adult.

If Gu Qi had been willing to communicate with him in the past, he would probably have lived a happy life like an ordinary child.

“I think so.” Gu Qi frowned. “If Dad gets together with Auntie Nian Nian, will we be able to live together in the future?”

“Yes. Does Little Qi like Auntie Nian Nian?”

“I like it. Auntie Nian Nian is the gentlest!” Gu Qi remembered clearly that a bad teacher had always bullied him in kindergarten.
