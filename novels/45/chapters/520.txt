“Really?” The man’s tone was slightly subdued, as if he didn’t believe her. His gaze never left her lips.

“Of course it’s true. I won’t lie to you,” Qiao Nian said kindly.

Gu Zhou reached out and gently caressed Qiao Nian’s beautiful face. His eyes became more and more misty. In a gentle voice, he said, “Nian’er, what do you think I should do to make you stay by my side forever? What if I never go anywhere else?” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Qiao Nian’s heart trembled.

Her gaze was not at all like Zhou Zhou’s. It was more like the usual Gu Zhou’s.

He looked a little different from the usual Gu Zhou. He seemed to be a little sickly.

Strange, wasn’t he Zhou Zhou now?

Would Zhou Zhou have a third personality when he felt insecure?

It was as if he hadn’t called her Nian Nian just now. He seemed to have called her Nian’er.

Moreover, what was even stranger was that he didn’t call himself Zhou Zhou just now.

Could this be Gu Zhou’s third personality?

If that was the case, Gu Zhou’s condition would only worsen.

No, this couldn’t happen!

Without hesitation, Qiao Nian hugged him.

She looked up into his eyes and gently touched his back, hoping that he would calm down as soon as possible.

“You don’t have to do anything. I’ll always be by your side. I won’t go anywhere. Zhou Zhou, be good. Let’s go take a shower now, okay?”

His cold hand slid gently across Qiao Nian’s face, finally landing on Qiao Nian’s lips. He pressed his fingers hard against her lips.

Qiao Nian felt the touch of his hand. Her eyes panicked, and her heart was in a mess.

The man gave a savage smile. He stuck out his tongue and licked the rainwater from his lips, then swallowed. The possessiveness in his eyes grew more and more obvious. Then, he moved closer to Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian was slightly taken aback. An indescribable sense of oppression instantly overwhelmed her. Her heart seemed to skip a beat as she looked at him nervously.

Qiao Nian’s lips parted slightly. “Zhou…”

Before she could finish speaking, Gu Zhou’s fingers touched her lips, forcing her to stop talking.

His hands were cold, but the places he had touched were burning hot. She swallowed nervously.

She wanted to escape now.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian took a step back. In the next moment, the man suddenly pressed his hand against her waist, forcing her to approach him.

Qiao Nian took a deep breath, her eyes darkening.

This was the first time Qiao Nian had seen Gu Zhou like this.

Qiao Nian subconsciously wanted to leave.

However, the man pressed her against the wall and whispered in her ear, “Nian’er, I want you to be with me forever.”

His voice was hoarse, as if he were suppressing his desire.

His hot breath rushed into Qiao Nian’s ear like waves, crashing into the beach again and again.

Qiao Nian’s face turned red and hot.

She looked up at Gu Zhou and saw the shy look in his eyes.

His hand slid down from Qiao Nian’s lips and landed on her collar.

Qiao Nian took a deep breath and tried her best to remain calm. She reached out and held Gu Zhou’s hand, her heart gradually racing.

She believed that the man in front of her was neither Zhou Zhou nor Gu Zhou.

“Who are you?” Qiao Nian asked carefully.

Gu Zhou’s hand lingered on Qiao Nian’s collarbone for a moment. His gaze gradually turned cold as he said coldly, “You’re really disobedient. How dare you forget my name!”

He looked devilish.

At this moment, Qiao Nian was completely certain that the man in front of her was Gu Zhou’s third personality.

“Nian’er.” The man’s low and hoarse voice sounded again. “Why are you so disobedient? How should I punish Nian’er?”

Qiao Nian was shocked.
