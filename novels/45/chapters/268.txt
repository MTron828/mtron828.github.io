Chapter 269: Scheming

When Lu Nian heard Qiao Nian’s words, his long eyelashes drooped. After the violin music stopped that afternoon, he looked through the window and saw the clock on the other school building. The clock showed 3:30 p.m.

Actually, there was no need to ask this at all. When he heard Qiao Nian play the violin just now, he was already completely certain that the person he was looking for was Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian looked at Lu Nian and immediately understood.

If she wasn’t wrong, the person in the training room yesterday afternoon should have been Mr. Dong Hua, not Brother Cao.

Following this line of thought, she would be the female musician Mr. Dong Hua was looking for.

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian was very excited. It wasn’t because she had been chosen by Mr. Dong Hua as a female musician, but because her violin skills had been recognized by Mr. Dong Hua.

Mr. Dong Hua was her idol. It was a matter of pride for her to be recognized by her idol for playing the violin!

Xia Xue probably lied to Brother Cao. She had impersonated her to become Brother Cao’s official female musician.

Hehe!

Xia Xue was quite good at scheming. She had already schemed against her.

Qiao Nian’s beautiful fox-like eyes narrowed. They were 30% cunning and 70% cold.

Xia Xue actually dared to use her name to deceive her idol, Mr. Dong Hua. Shouldn’t she pay a price?

Wang Xuan now understood. She knew that Mr. Dong Hua was a smart person. There was no need for her to remind him of anything else. She guessed that the female musician Mr. Dong Hua had taken a liking to from the beginning was Qiao Nian.

Since neither of the parties involved had spoken up, there was no need for her to continue speaking. Everyone probably had their own opinions.

Everyone present was very smart. Listening to their conversation, they vaguely understood what they meant.

Qiao Nian put away the violin and glanced at the time on her wrist. Smiling, she said to Matriarch Gu, “Grandma, it’s getting late. We still have a class in the afternoon. Xuan Xuan and I will return to school to prepare for class.”

“Go!” Matriarch Gu smiled at Qiao Nian. She turned to Butler Ye and said, “Get someone to send them back!”

“Yes, sir.”

“Thank you, Grandma!” After Qiao Nian spoke to Matriarch Gu, her gaze fell on Lu Nian again. When she was in pain, Lu Nian’s song had saved her from her pain.

Now that Qiao Nian had the opportunity to get close to Mr. Dong Hua, she couldn’t help but feel a little nervous. “Mr. Dong Hua, I hope that I can ask for your guidance in the future!”

“Okay.” Lu Nian smiled at Qiao Nian.

Holding Wang Xuan’s hand, Qiao Nian left the living room.

When the two of them were in the car, they did not speak. By tacit agreement, they walked towards the classroom.

There was no one on the road now. When Wang Xuan thought of Gao Lin’s arrogant words in the classroom, she felt disgusted.

She didn’t understand how Gao Lin and Xia Xue had the cheek to impersonate Nian Nian. How dare they show off in front of Nian Nian herself!

His face was thicker than a city wall.

The more Wang Xuan thought about it, the angrier she became. She couldn’t help but complain, “Nian Nian, Xia Xue and Gao Lin are too shameless. Xia Xue took advantage of you to participate in the concert. Previously, I thought that she might drag Mr. Dong Hua down, but now I’m 100% sure that she will. Not only that, if the news of her impersonation is exposed, her character will be questioned. She will probably ruin Mr. Dong Huang’s concert. The only solution now is to expose her true colors and resolve her hidden danger as soon as possible!”

Qiao Nian smiled at Wang Xuan. Wang Xuan had hit the nail on the head. She was indeed her good friend. Their hearts were connected.

Seeing Qiao Nian’s smile, Wang Xuan instantly understood. She asked curiously, “Have you already thought of how to deal with Xia Xue?”

Qiao Nian smiled at Wang Xuan and said lazily, “Do you think we should go to practice the violin in practice room 23? We’ll practice ‘Missing’.”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Wang Xuan smiled until her eyes narrowed into a line. She gave Qiao Nian a thumbs up. “This is amazing. She’ll definitely be scared to death!”

Qiao Nian’s red lips curved into a wicked smile. Her fingers elegantly tucked her hair behind her ear as she said casually, “It’s so boring to scare someone to death. When a cat catches a mouse, it always has to tease the mouse. Only then will it be fun!”Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com
