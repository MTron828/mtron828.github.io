967 Sorry

“I’m sorry.” As Gu Zhou spoke, he looked down at Qiao Nian, who was in his arms. Qiao Nian lowered her gaze, her long eyelashes covering her eyes, looking pitiful. “I’ve always wanted to apologize to you, but I couldn’t find you. Back then, I really couldn’t control myself, so I did that to you. All of this is my fault.”

Qiao Nian sat calmly in his arms and slowly closed her eyes.

She was conflicted.

Her subconscious told her to get out of here quickly. She didn’t want to stay here. This was hell.

But her rationality told her that she had to face all of this hard truth. If she wanted to walk out of hell, she had to face it bravely.

At that time, she had helped Xiao Shi walk out of her nightmare like this.

She was only five years old, but she had already walked out of the nightmare of Song Man jumping off a building.

She was Xiao Shi’s mommy. How could she be so timid and not dare to face the nightmares of the past?

Qiao Nian took a deep breath and looked up at Gu Zhou, who was sitting beside her. She asked, “How did you know?”

Seeing that Qiao Nian was willing to communicate with him, Gu Zhou heaved a sigh of relief. “When you asked me where I had been schemed against, you didn’t look right.”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She asked in surprise, “Just because my expression wasn’t right?”

“The day Song Man jumped off the building, I felt that something was wrong. Every time I see Xiao Shi smile, I keep feeling that it’s especially familiar.”

Gu Zhou paused for a moment, his gaze falling on Qiao Nian’s fox-like eyes. “It was exactly the same as when you smiled when you were young. At that time, I felt that the person that night might be you.”

Qiao Nian recalled Xiao Shi’s face. Xiao Shi also had a pair of beautiful fox-like eyes. At that time, she had felt that Xiao Shi looked a little familiar. Later on, when she heard from Gu Zhou that he was in An City when he was schemed against, she was basically certain that she was Xiao Shi’s mother.

“Xiao Shi is very similar to you. Coupled with your reaction after you found out that I had been schemed against in An City, I was 90% sure that the girl is you.” Gu Zhou looked into Qiao Nian’s eyes. His face was reflected in hers.

At this moment, he hoped that Qiao Nian would only have eyes for him in the future.

Qiao Nian frowned slightly, her emotions complicated. She looked at Gu Zhou’s face. “Don’t tell me you do things based on your emotions!”

“I asked Chen Qing to do a DNA test on you and Gu Qi. The report shows that you’re mother and son!” Gu Zhou said in a low voice.

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she frowned and asked, “So, you knew that day?”

Gu Zhou nodded.

Qiao Nian didn’t reply.

At first, she had only suspected that she was the mother of two children. That was why she had gone for a DNA test.

At this moment, Qiao Nian realized that Gu Zhou was very smart.

The reason why she could guess this was because Gu Zhou had told her about his scheme six years ago and Gu Qi’s background.

Then, she knew the time and place, so she could deduce that the man that night was very likely Gu Zhou.

However, Gu Zhou did not know what had happened to her in the past, nor did he know what she had experienced in the past. He had actually guessed correctly through her reaction.

This man was really too smart!

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou. Perhaps this was fate. She was destined to be with Gu Zhou!

Seeing that Qiao Nian had fallen silent, Gu Zhou reached out and held her hand.

Qiao Nian wanted to retract her hand, but she couldn’t. She looked up and met Gu Zhou’s affectionate eyes.

She was at a loss.

Gu Zhou held her hand tightly and said, “We were already engaged before you were born.”

Qiao Nian pursed her lips and remained silent. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

More and more possessiveness gradually surged in Gu Zhou’s eyes, but his voice was still very gentle. “Even though you left the Lu family for so many years, I met you again when you were six years old!”

As Qiao Nian listened to Gu Zhou’s words, her memories drifted back to when she was six years old on the spiritual mountain. Her heart skipped a beat, and the way she looked at Gu Zhou softened a lot.

“Brother Chuan,” Qiao Nian called out softly.

Before Qiao Yu, that imposter, appeared, she had been waiting for Brother White Shirt.
