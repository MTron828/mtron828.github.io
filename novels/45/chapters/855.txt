856 The Truth

When Qiao Nian saw him, she threw the hoe in her hand to the ground. A bright smile appeared on her face as she ran towards him.

When Qiao Nian ran up to him, she stopped. She looked up at him and called out sweetly, “Brother White Shirt!”

Qiao Nian’s face was chubby. Qiao Yu tried hard to control his urge to pinch her face.

At that time, Qiao Yu’s first thought was that Qiao Nian’s personality was really good. She was lively and cheerful, and was very friendly to everyone. Even to a stranger like him, she was very warm.

!!

At that time, he hadn’t thought too much about it. He had thought that Qiao Nian had called him Brother White Shirt because he was wearing a white shirt!

He agreed readily.

He would always remember Qiao Nian’s smile at that time. It was like a ray of sunlight in the darkness.

At that time, he was very puzzled. Why didn’t his mother like Qiao Nian? Qiao Nian was clearly so cute.

At that time, he swore to himself that he would protect Qiao Nian and treat her well forever.

Moreover, he especially liked it when Qiao Nian called him Brother White Shirt. Every time Qiao Nian called him that, her voice would always be soft.

After interacting with Qiao Nian for a long time, he wanted to tell her the truth. He was Qiao Yu, her brother. Perhaps Qiao Nian wouldn’t be angry with him anymore.

At that moment, Qiao Nian took out a photo and handed it to him.

“Brother White Shirt, you left after saving me back then. You might have forgotten to take this photo. I’ve kept it until now. Then can you teach me how to draw? I want to draw this photo!”

Qiao Nian’s words echoed in his ears.

He didn’t speak. He just looked at Qiao Nian in disappointment, his heart already sinking to the bottom.

He had thought that Qiao Nian was treating him so well because she liked him. He didn’t expect Qiao Nian to have mistaken him for someone else.

No wonder Qiao Nian had been so enthusiastic around him the first time he saw her.

He was a little envious of the person Qiao Nian had called Brother White Shirt. More than that, he was jealous.

Why wasn’t that person him?

If it were him, he could live with Qiao Nian forever.

He had also thought of explaining this matter to Qiao Nian, but every time he wanted to, he couldn’t say it when he met Qiao Nian’s starry eyes.

He was afraid that if he said it, Qiao Nian would leave him in the future.

He had been hiding it because he was afraid of losing her. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Although he knew that Qiao Nian would be very angry if she knew the truth, he was really unwilling to say it.

He had always thought that this matter could be hidden for the rest of her life, but Qiao Nian finally knew the truth.

Indeed, a stolen identity did not belong to him.

…

At the Dongjiang villa.

When Qiao Nian drove to the entrance of the villa, she saw Gu Zhou’s car driving towards her from afar.

She took a closer look and saw Gu Zhou sitting in the driver’s seat.

When she first saw Gu Zhou, her heart began to race uncontrollably.

She parked the car and got out. Gu Zhou, who was opposite her, also stopped the car and got out.

The moment their gazes met, Qiao Nian’s breathing quickened, and the blood in her body began to boil. When she looked at Gu Zhou, it was as if ten thousand years had passed in a single glance.

Today, Gu Zhou was wearing a white shirt. Some of the hair on his forehead fluttered in the wind. He had deep eyes, a high nose bridge, and thin lips. He gave off a sense of sensual passion.

He stood there like a nobleman who had walked out of a comic book.

At this moment, Gu Zhou was looking at her intently.

Under the sunlight, Gu Zhou looked exactly like the brother in white who had pulled her off the cliff many years ago.

Qiao Nian’s eyes were a little hot. She pursed her lips and quickly walked towards Gu Zhou.

Images of her interactions with Gu Zhou in the past flashed across her mind. She recalled what she had experienced with him.

From the beginning to the end, Gu Zhou had always stood by her side to protect her. He had always placed her first.

It was clearly only a few meters away, but to Qiao Nian, it was very far. She ran lightly to Gu Zhou. When she reached him, she gently stood on her tiptoes and kissed Gu Zhou’s lips without hesitation.

Gu Zhou felt the softness of Qiao Nian’s mouth on his. His entire body froze, and his pupils dilated uncontrollably.
