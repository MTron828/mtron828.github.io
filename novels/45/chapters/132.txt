Chapter 133 Doubts

Qiao Nian glanced at him with a complicated expression. Seeing that he didn’t seem to be a busybody, she put the cheque away. Her gaze was cold. “Remember your promise!”

Although this sentence couldn’t be considered a threat, it still made the instructor’s heart skip a beat. He hurriedly nodded and said, “Understood. I’ll remember your instructions!”

Qiao Nian didn’t say anything more. She walked out of the gymnasium.

At this moment, Chen Qing, who had been sitting in the car, was still on the phone. He was telling Gu Zhou everything he had heard from the phone call between Su Xue and Qiao Nian.

“Looks like it’s finally time for the Qiao family to learn what it means to be sensible.” Gu Zhou’s voice trailed off, sounding extremely dangerous.

Chen Qing was also extremely dissatisfied with Su Xue’s verbal abuse of Qiao Nian. Hearing Gu Zhou’s words, he approved wholeheartedly. “That’s right, that’s right. The things they say to Madam are awful. I can’t stand it!”

“Got it.” Gu Zhou’s tone was very calm.

Chen Qing frowned in confusion.

That was it?

Was Gu Zhou not going to say anything else?

Chen Qing did not dare to ask.

Gu Zhou continued impassively, “Now, all you have to do is follow her around. You don’t have to pick me up.”

Before Chen Qing could reply, Gu Zhou had already hung up. When Chen Qing heard the dial tone, he was momentarily stunned.

He was extremely puzzled. Second Young Master Gu had typically always defended Madam, but Second Young Master Gu seemed extremely impassive today. It seemed that he had no intention of defending Madam.

While Chen Qing was still in a daze, Qiao Nian walked out of the gym.

Chen Qing hurriedly got out of the car and opened the car door for Qiao Nian. Seeing that Qiao Nian’s face was pale and that she was radiating a cold aura, he asked carefully, “Madam, where are we going next?”

Hatred flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes. “The Qiao family house.”

Chen Qing quickly replied, “Yes, ma’am.” He made a note to himself to investigate Feng Yun Gym later.

Chen Qing got back into the car, started it, and drove towards the Qiao family home.

Qiao Nian sat in the car. She paid no mind to the scenery outside the car. All she could think about was what Su Xue had just said.

Qiao Nian clenched her fists so tightly that the veins on the back of her hands bulged.

Perhaps in the eyes of that gigolo, Su Xue didn’t mean what she said. Perhaps the gigolo thought that Su Xue was only speaking out of anger. However, Qiao Nian knew in her heart that that wasn’t the case.

Moreover, judging from the gigolo’s reaction, Su Xue had expressed similar sentiments to him many times.

She still remembered how every time Su Xue got angry at her, she would always say,

“I must have been cursed with bad luck to have raised a wretched child like you!”

“I raised you painstakingly, but in the end, you’ve grown up into an ingrate!”

“If I had known that you were like this, I wouldn’t have brought you home back then!”

Wait a minute.

This time, Qiao Nian suddenly realized something. Every time Su Xue scolded her, she never used the phrase “give birth”. She would only use the word “raise”.

In the past, she hadn’t thought too much about it, so she hadn’t noticed this detail.

But now Qiao Nian finally understood Su Xue’s choice of words.

Qiao Nian narrowed her eyes, the coldness in her gaze intensifying. She had to figure out if she truly was a biological daughter of the Qiao family!

In twenty minutes, the car arrived at the entrance of the Qiao family’s villa.

Qiao Shan seemed to know of Qiao Nian’s visit. He had been waiting at the door since early in the morning. When he saw Qiao Nian getting out of the car, he quickly walked forward. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Qiao Nian stood at the side, staring unblinkingly at Qiao Shan’s face. This was the first time she had sized up Qiao Shan’s facial features so seriously.

Indeed, not only did she not look like Su Xue, but she also did not look like Qiao Shan.

Seeing that Qiao Nian was standing there with no intention of admitting her mistake, Qiao Shan flew into a rage. He aimed a slap at Qiao Nian’s face.

Qiao Nian continued looking at Qiao Shan intently, not saying a word.

Chen Qing was standing at the side. Seeing Qiao Shan’s actions, his expression flickered. Quickly, he stepped forward and grabbed Qiao Shan’s hand. He questioned coldly, “Mr. Qiao, what are you doing? Are you looking down on the Gu family?”

Qiao Shan was so angry that his blood was boiling. His darling daughter, Qiao Xin, had returned from the research institute in tears. In an aggrieved manner, she had told him everything that had happened there.
