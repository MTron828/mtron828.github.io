Chapter 1807 - 1807 To the Airport

Most of the cars here were envoy cars from Mark’s Manor. Basically, there were many people in the cars. There were no empty cars at all.

Qiao Nian frowned slightly. She had been too impulsive just now. She should have driven Professor Ollie’s car out. If she had been any later, Eldest Senior Brother would have taken a plane and left.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips tightly and was about to forcefully stop the car. At this moment, a black car circled her and braked in front of her. Then, it stopped steadily in front of her.

At this moment, the passenger door in front of her opened.

Qiao Nian turned her head slightly and saw Gu Zhou looking at her. His thin lips parted slightly. “Get in.”

Qiao Nian smiled and got into the car. She closed the door and fastened her seatbelt. She looked at Gu Zhou beside her. “Are you going to be a racing driver?”

She was originally standing by the roadside. Behind her was the square in front of the palace. It was very spacious.

“It seems like Mrs. Gu still likes my driving skills.”

“Mr. Gu is right.” Qiao Nian smiled at Gu Zhou. Seeing that he was still not driving, she hurriedly urged, “Let’s go to the airport.”

Only then did Gu Zhou start the car. He looked straight ahead and asked calmly, “Has Mrs. Gu already forgotten about me?”

Qiao Nian smiled in embarrassment. She just wanted to see her Eldest Senior Brother again, so she ran out of the palace and did not think too much about it.

“If I hadn’t come, would you have planned to stop the cars directly?” Gu Zhou asked with a smile.

Qiao Nian felt the air turn cold. She hurriedly smiled and said, “How is that possible?”

Afraid that Gu Zhou would still be calculative about what had just happened, Qiao Nian hurriedly began to look at her watch. Seeing that there was only an hour left, she asked worriedly, “It’s almost too late. Can we be faster?”

“Of course.” Gu Zhou stepped on the accelerator, and the scenery outside the window retreated quickly.

Qiao Nian slowly relaxed. Time passed bit by bit, and the car was about to arrive at the airport. Chang Feng’s plane was about to take off in about 20 minutes.

Suddenly, a thought flashed across her mind. Previously, she had felt that she had forgotten something. Only then did she look at Gu Zhou beside her. “By the way, did you tell Dad that Big Brother will be returning to MY tonight? Will he come over?”

Qiao Nian also knew that Gu Ting had loaned them manpower, which meant that Gu Ting knew everything that had happened today.

All these years, her eldest brother, Gu Yue, had been overseas. Their family had not seen each other much. This time, they finally had a chance to meet. Previously, she had even instructed Gu Zhou to tell Gu Ting that he could see his eldest brother.

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s question, his pupils constricted slightly. Then, his eyes darkened, and his voice was low and hoarse. “He, he has something to do…”

“Something to do…”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. Logically speaking, he shouldn’t have anything to do tonight.

She turned to look at Gu Zhou beside her. Seeing that there was something wrong with Gu Zhou’s expression, she did not say anything else.

Qiao Nian turned to look out of the window and sighed softly.

Qiao Nian really couldn’t understand what Father Gu was thinking.

It was a happy thing for the Gu family that Big Brother was not dead. If Grandma Gu knew that Big Brother was not dead, she would definitely be especially happy.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

However, they could only tell Grandma about these things bit by bit. They were afraid that Grandma would be too happy and have a heart attack, so they were slowly mentally preparing Grandma for the news.

Qiao Nian frowned slightly. Previously, when they went to MY to see her brother, she could feel how much Gu Zhou’s brother cared about him.

When she met her father with Gu Zhou, she had also noticed that he was very concerned about her.

In her opinion, they clearly cared about each other very much, but neither of them could express their feelings properly.

Was it because of the environment they lived in when they were young?

Why did Father Gu and Bai Hui separate back then?

“Nian’er?”

When she heard Gu Zhou’s voice, Qiao Nian suddenly came back to her senses.

“What are you thinking about? Haven’t you noticed that you’ve already arrived at the airport?”
Gu Zhou met Qiao Nian’s worried and confused gaze and roughly understood what she was thinking.
