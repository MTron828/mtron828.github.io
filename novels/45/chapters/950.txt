“Ah!” Qiao Shan screamed in pain. The pain in his leg couldn’t compare to the pain in his heart.

After smashing the baseball bat, Qiao Xin threw it down and looked at Qiao Shan in tears. She kowtowed hard. “Dad, I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I didn’t do it on purpose. I really didn’t do it on purpose!”

Qiao Shan’s heart was like dead ashes.

“I’m still young. I’m more valuable. I still have to get married in the future. If I lose a leg now, it’ll be a huge loss for the Qiao family. I’ll also drag the Qiao family down!”

!!

A tear slowly fell from Qiao Shan’s eye.

He knew that Qiao Xin was right, but his heart still ached. The daughter he had painstakingly raised had broken his leg with her own hands!

“Dad, please let me go. You’ve already begun to retire. It’s fine for you to be in a wheelchair for the rest of your life. Don’t worry, I’ll definitely take good care of you in the future. Dad, don’t be angry with me. Don’t blame me, okay?” Qiao Xin said tearfully, her heart choked with emotion.

When Qiao Shan heard Qiao Xin’s words, he was shocked.

Although Qiao Xin’s words made sense, he was still very disappointed in her.

His heart ached for Qiao Xin, but what about her?

She seemed to care more about herself.

Gu Zhou sat on a chair. Seeing such an exciting scene, he smiled and said, “Miss Qiao Xin is so filial. There hasn’t been anyone as filial as you since ancient times!”

Qiao Xin looked at Gu Zhou in fear. She wanted to explain something, but she didn’t know what to say.

She didn’t dare to speak, worried that she would make more mistakes.

Gu Zhou sat on the spot and continued, “I want a comminuted fracture. You just hit him once. It’s impossible to break his leg bone. Hit him a few more times!”

Qiao Xin had initially felt guilty for hitting Qiao Shan’s leg. Now, she was no longer willing to pick up the baseball bat.

“Chen Qing, break Qiao Xin’s legs!” Gu Zhou stood up and said impatiently.

Chen Qing picked up the stick and was about to hit Qiao Xin’s leg when Qiao Xin hugged Chen Qing’s thigh and cried, “Hit… hit my father!”

Chen Qing received a nod from Gu Zhou. He picked up the stick and hit Qiao Shan’s leg cleanly.

Crack. The sound of breaking bones.

“Ah!”

Qiao Shan’s face turned pale from the pain, and his forehead was covered in cold sweat. He fell to the ground, unable to move.

“Dad!” Qiao Xin cried, looking at Qiao Shan with heartache.

Qiao Shan was in so much pain that he couldn’t speak. Lying on the ground, he panted heavily.

Tears streamed down Qiao Xin’s face. She stared in horror at Qiao Shan’s legs, at the white floor that was stained red with blood. Her mind went blank.

Gu Zhou walked towards Qiao Shan.

Qiao Shan had been lying on the ground. When he saw Gu Zhou walking over, his body trembled uncontrollably, as if he had seen the Grim Reaper.

With great effort, Qiao Xin crawled up to Gu Zhou and placed Qiao Shan behind her. She cried, “Second Young Master, I beg you… stop hitting him. My father can’t take it!”

“Why don’t you bear his pain?” Gu Zhou looked down at Qiao Xin and sneered, his eyes dark.

Qiao Xin swayed on the spot, but she couldn’t fall yet. Her eyes darted around. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Gu Zhou had done all of this to avenge Qiao Nian, and also because he liked Qiao Nian.

However, no man could tolerate his woman having sex with an old man. No man could accept that his woman had once given birth!

Qiao Xin knew that the only thing she could do now was to divert Gu Zhou’s attention from them to Qiao Nian.

“Second Young Master, I think there’s something my sister hasn’t told you.” Qiao Xin’s eyes were red-rimmed. She didn’t dare to look at Gu Zhou’s face and continued, “Six years ago, my sister slept with an old man for 100,000 yuan!”

The air instantly turned cold.

Qiao Xin didn’t hear Gu Zhou speak for a long time. She carefully looked up and met Gu Zhou’s bottomless eyes.

She felt that Gu Zhou must be angry!

“I don’t think there should be any secrets between husband and wife when you’re with Sister,” Qiao Xin said timidly.
