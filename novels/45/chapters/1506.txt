1507 Go Out First

The president hugged Shen Mei with all his might. When Shen Mei flared up again, her strength was several times greater than usual. It was not something he could control casually.

Holding the silver needle, Qiao Nian was observing Shen Mei. She hadn’t expected Shen Mei to have such a big reaction.

Qiao Nian narrowed her eyes slightly. She hadn’t expected Shen Mei to go crazy just by looking at the needles.

However, Shen Mei’s epilepsy didn’t seem to be because of her cerebral palsy. Could it be because of the Hypnotic worm in Shen Mei’s body?

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian changed her original plan. After disinfecting the wound, she inserted the silver needle into another acupuncture point.

Shen Mei, who had been struggling desperately, calmed down.

Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. After a while, she pulled out the needle. Shen Mei fell into a crazy state again. Not only that, but Shen Mei’s face grew paler and paler, as if something was sucking her life force.

Shen Mei looked at the bedside table with unfocused eyes. Her eyes were red.

Qiao Nian looked in Shen Mei’s direction and saw her looking at the Falling Autumn Grass not far away. She frowned slightly.

The Falling Autumn Grass had a calming effect, but the way Shen Mei looked at it was not because she wanted it, but because she was very afraid of it.

The president didn’t understand why Shen Mei had suddenly gone crazy. He looked in the direction Shen Mei was looking and was stunned.

He tried to move Shen Mei’s head, but Shen Mei’s gaze was fixed on the Falling Autumn Grass on the bedside table.

Worried, the president experimented a few more times. When he was completely sure that Shen Mei had been staring at the Falling Autumn Grass on the bedside table, his eyes welled up.

He pursed his dry lips and said, “Doctor Qiao, can you take the Falling Autumn Grass out first?”

Qiao Nian looked at Shen Mei thoughtfully. She took the Falling Autumn Grass out and placed it on the table outside the screen.

When Qiao Nian walked into the room again, she saw that Shen Mei was breathing heavily. The extent of her madness had decreased a lot.

She glanced at the watch on her wrist. Two minutes had passed since she took the Falling Autumn Grass out and Shen Mei regained her composure.

She frowned slightly and took out a silver needle, preparing to insert it into Shen Mei’s body. At this moment, Shen Mei shouted again.

Seeing this, Qiao Nian could only give up on the idea of performing acupuncture on Shen Mei. Shen Mei’s body was weak now, and she couldn’t withstand any torment.

The president didn’t dare to risk Shen Mei’s life. He said to Qiao Nian, “Go out first.”

Seeing that Qiao Nian had left, Shen Mei’s deranged state improved a lot. She had spent too much energy just now, and now she fell asleep from exhaustion.

Only then did the two of them leave Shen Mei’s room.

Lina had been guarding the door. She had just heard her mother scream and seen the wound on her father’s face. “Dad, Mom…”

Qiao Nian walked over to Gu Zhou. Gu Zhou looked at her worriedly. “How is it?”

Qiao Nian shook her head gently and said in a low voice, “It’s a little troublesome.”

The president didn’t have time to talk to Lina. He looked at Qiao Nian not far away and asked coldly, “Is there a problem with the Falling Autumn Grass?”

Qiao Nian’s expression was calm as she said, “There’s no problem.”

“If there’s no problem, then why did my Madam have a strong reaction to this pot of Falling Autumn Grass?” The president tried hard to suppress the anger in his heart. He gripped the flower pot tightly in his hand, wishing he could crush it.

He had thought that he would no longer have to rely on his scheming brother. Now, it seemed that he could not escape at all.

The president’s eyes were filled with disappointment. He hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to only be boasting previously. What was even sadder was that Qiao Nian couldn’t help him treat Madam’s illness.

For the past few days, he had been looking forward to Madam’s recovery every day.

Perhaps it was because he had too much hope for Qiao Nian that he was so disappointed.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips tightly, staring unblinkingly at the president.
