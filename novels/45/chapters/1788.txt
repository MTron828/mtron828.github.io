Chapter 1789 - 1789 Mark Went Around Them

“Protect the President to the death!”

…

The guards were powerful and imposing, scaring away many enemies.

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian looked at the guards in surprise. Their white shirts were already dyed red with blood, and their faces were stained with blood. However, their eyes were exceptionally bright, like stars in the night sky.

As for the president, who was protected by the guards in the middle, he stood there calmly and looked at the enemy not far away with a serious expression. The gloominess in his eyes increased.

Many people thought that the President had been compromising under Mark’s coercion for so many years because he was afraid of Mark and felt that the President was born weak. But at this moment, they realized that the President had only made this choice so the entire Europe could prosper.

The president was concerned about Europe, but Mark was concerned about the throne.

Sometimes, it was not just those who looked powerful who were the winners.

Qiao Nian looked at the President and sighed with emotion. The former President of Europe was really sharp. He knew that Mark was not suitable to be the President. Only a gentle and big-picture person was suitable to be the President.

Qiao Nian’s thoughts raced. She looked at Gu Zhou beside her and met his doting gaze. The corners of her lips curled up slightly.

When their eyes met, there was some tension in their eyes. They were both silently encouraging each other.

For today’s matter, Qiao Nian had prepared a lot of paralysis medicine. Unfortunately, the paralysis medicine would take a long time to take effect. During this period of time, they still needed to attack themselves.

There were more and more enemies approaching, but they were not in the mood to do anything else now. They only wanted to get rid of all the people in front of them.

Suddenly, the anxious voice of the general beside the president came from behind.

“Oh no, behind us!”

“Mark went around us to the back!”

These two voices were like a bolt of lightning, tearing through the gloomy and oppressive air, making everyone instantly nervous.

Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou had always wanted to deal with the enemies in front of them. It was precisely because of their reckless fighting style that they distanced themselves from the president.

When they heard the commotion, they rushed towards the president without hesitation.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The president felt the biting wind behind him and a chill down his spine. He looked back and saw that Mark had taken off his suit jacket. The three buttons on his loose shirt were all undone, and his muscular figure was vaguely visible.

Mark had a ruthless expression on his face. His intense hatred was like a tornado, making people instinctively afraid.

Mark walked step by step toward the president. All these years, he had been waiting for this moment. He had waited too long.

He originally wanted his subordinates to attack the president, but when he saw that those people were in a mess, he felt relieved. The sooner he ended the battle and all of this, the sooner he would feel at ease.

As long as the president died now, the rest would be easy to handle.

There were not only the media outside, but also envoys from various countries. Victory and defeat would happen at this moment.

He had worked so hard for this moment.

He did not want to wait any longer.

Mark gripped the long knife in his hand tightly. The blade flickered with a cold light as he rushed towards the president without hesitation.

The guards guarding the back of the president were tied up by others. Some of the guards were pulled away. Everyone could only watch helplessly as Mark rushed towards the president with a knife.

Lina, who was standing on the stage, had been paying attention to the president’s situation. When she saw this situation, her expression suddenly changed and she subconsciously ran towards the president.

Lina tripped over her skirt and fell to the ground. She looked at the president not far away with tears in her eyes and shouted hysterically, “Father!”

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian also abandoned the enemies behind them and ran towards the president.

Just as Mark’s knife was about to reach the president, the president bent down and pulled out a knife from the waist of the fallen guard. The long knife blocked Mark’s attack.

The sound of the sabers clashing was ear-piercing and resounded throughout the hall.

Mark’s strength was so great that the long knife in the president’s hand trembled, as if it would be cut off by the knife in Mark’s hand in the next moment.
