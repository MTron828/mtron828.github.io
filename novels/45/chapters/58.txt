“Brother Su Yan, you’re the best. Let’s go visit Sister first. I’m a little worried about her,” Qiao Xin said gently. Holding on to Su Yan’s arm, she walked towards Qiao Nian.

“Sister, when you burned down the school building back then, the principal was furious. He wouldn’t let you step foot onto campus. If it weren’t for our family name, he likely wouldn’t have made an exception for you to come today.”

Qiao Xin continued, “The principal doesn’t visit the university often, but he will be here today. Brother Su Yan will intercede for you. Perhaps the principal will no longer be angry. He might even allow you to return to school.”

The classmates nearby heard Qiao Xin’s words clearly.

“I’m so jealous that Senior Su Yan can meet the principal. I’ve been studying here for so long, but I’ve never even seen the principal once. I heard that the principal is very busy every day!”

“Yes, yes. I’ve heard that too. Back then, when the school building was burned down, many netizens were questioning the school’s role in the incident. If the principal hadn’t taken charge at that critical moment, and if he hadn’t whole-heartedly thrown his weight behind the school, we would have lost that battle.”

“I heard that the principal is now focusing on his mathematics research, so he rarely makes an appearance here. How can Qiao Nian still have the cheek to show up? What if she angers the principal?”

“Exactly, exactly. We should protest against Qiao Nian’s enrollment in An University!”

“You’re right. We must stand up to Qiao Nian!”

One by one, the surrounding students chimed in. They really liked and respected the principal. To them, the principal was like a god to be worshiped.

Listening to the other students, Su Yan glanced at Qiao Nian. The disgust in his eyes intensified.

Qiao Nian turned to look at Qiao Xin and said expressionlessly, “Can you stop polluting the air around me?”

Qiao Xin: “?”

At this moment, the principal’s assistant, Wang Qi, looked toward them. He began walking over.

Su Yan saw Wang Qi and thought that the principal was looking for him. He straightened his clothes and put on a warm smile.

When Wang Qi walked over, Su Yan took a step forward and politely extended his hand to Wang Qi.

Wang Qi gave Su Yan a strange look. Without shaking his hand, he brushed past Su Yan and walked towards Qiao Nian. With a serious expression, he said, “Miss Qiao, you’re finally here. The principal has specially instructed me to pick you up.”

Qiao Xin looked at Wang Qi in disbelief. She had never expected the principal to instruct his assistant to pick herself up. She smiled at Wang Qi. “Alright, let’s head over now.”

Qiao Nian looked at Qiao Xin in confusion. She had an appointment with the principal. Could it be that Qiao Xin had an appointment with the principal as well?

Wang Qi turned to look at Qiao Xin, and the smile on his face instantly disappeared. He asked without expression, “This student, who exactly are you?”

Qiao Xin still didn’t realize anything odd about the whole affair. She said innocently, “I’m Qiao Xin.”

“My apologies, the principal would like to invite Miss Qiao Nian over.” Wang Qi smiled ingratiatingly at Qiao Nian. “Miss Qiao, let’s go!”

When Wang Qi and Qiao Nian left, Su Yan and Qiao Xin felt as if they had been slapped in the face. They were so embarrassed that they wanted to find a hole to hide in.

Of course, the surrounding classmates who were watching the spectacle were also stunned. They had never expected the principal and assistant to treat Qiao Nian with such respect.

Didn’t the principal hate Qiao Nian?

Didn’t the principal forbid Qiao Nian from coming to school?

Why was the principal’s assistant so respectful towards Qiao Nian?

Shen Xing, who was standing not far away, turned pale. She turned to look toward Qiao Xin. So Qiao Xin had lied to her!

However, when Shen Xing saw Qiao Xin’s confused expression, she hesitated. She walked over to Qiao Xin and asked in a low voice, “What’s the relationship between Qiao Nian and the principal?”

“I don’t know.” Qiao Xin shook her head honestly. Suddenly, she recalled Qiao Nian saying that she had received her PhD diploma.

Oh my god!

Qiao Nian couldn’t really have been awarded a doctorate, could she?

How… How was this possible?

Qiao Xin gasped in shock.. A layer of cold sweat formed on her palms.
