Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“What else is there to think about? Of course, she has to choose the Imperial Jades!”

“Exactly. They wouldn’t even let her look at it. Maybe the moon goddess wasn’t so mysterious after all.”

“They’re too stingy. They won’t even let us see it!”

… .

The host looked up at the time and smiled at Qiao Nian. “Miss Qiao, there are still three minutes left. If you don’t give an answer…”

“I choose the Moon Goddess.” Qiao Nian interrupted the host without hesitation.

The host was slightly stunned. He looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief.

There was actually someone in this world who did not bow down to tens of billions!

Everyone present was stunned, looking at Qiao Nian in surprise.

“Oh my God, she’s willing to give up tens of billions to choose the Moon Goddess!”

“But it’s tens of billions. How could she bear to do that?”

“My heart is bleeding!”

… .

......

Qiao Nian calmly accepted everyone’s surprised gazes. She looked at the host and asked, “Then can you give me the Moon Goddess now?”

It took a long time for the host to calm down. He revealed a friendly smile and said, “Miss Qiao, congratulations on clearing the level!”

When everyone heard the host say this, they were all stunned.

What does that mean?

Qiao Nian narrowed her beautiful foxy eyes slightly.

The host’s gaze landed on everyone’s faces as he smiled and explained, “Previously, Mr. Chen had said that the Moon Goddess is a spiritual necklace. The Moon Goddess can’t be measured with money. If a person chooses wealth, it means that the Moon Goddess isn’t fated with her.”

After saying this, the host looked at Qiao Nian again and said, “Miss Qiao and the Moon Goddess are fated. Moreover, Miss Qiao has already passed this test. Therefore, you can take all the jadeite you obtained before the competition with the Moon Goddess.”

Hearing the host say this, the others were instantly confused.

It turned out that the so-called third stage was a test of the human heart.

In that case, Qiao Nian would be even richer. A beauty worth billions!

At this moment, someone in the crowd asked curiously, “What if Miss Qiao had chosen the jadeite just now?”

The host said calmly, “If Miss Qiao chooses the jadeite, it means that she didn’t pass the third round. She will lose all the jadeite she won in the stone gambling competition this time. Moreover, the Moon Goddess will also be given to the contestant with the highest value in the first and second rounds.”

Hearing the host say this, everyone was stunned. Then, they looked at the valuation list on the big screen.

Second place was Lu Zhu.

Everyone broke out in cold sweat and sighed.

However, if Qiao Nian had been a little greedy just now, she would have lost everything.

However, Qiao Nian had just chosen the Moon Goddess without hesitation.

Qiao Nian tilted her head to look at Lu Zhu, who was not far away. There was a hint of loneliness in his eyes under his glasses, as if he was trying to ease the gloom in his heart.

Qiao Nian knew very well that Lu Zhu also cared a lot about the Moon Goddess.

However, there was only one Moon Goddess, and she had already promised Grandma that she would give it to her.

If that hadn’t been the case, she could have given him the moon goddess.

As soon as this thought appeared, Qiao Nian was shocked.

She was actually so generous to a man she did not know well.

At this moment, the host’s words interrupted Qiao Nian’s thoughts.

“Congratulations on winning the stone gambling competition, Miss Qiao. Next, our director will present the prizes. Please come on stage to receive them!”

After the host finished speaking, everyone applauded her. They were sincerely cheering for Qiao Nian. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Qiao Nian deserved to be the champion.

Qiao Nian calmly walked towards the podium.
