728 We’re Going Back!

Lu Nian looked up at Lu Zhu, wanting him to speak up for him. However, Lu Zhu stood there and ignored his pleading gaze.

“Ah Nian, you’re so close to Gu Zhou. You can’t do anything to hurt Gu Zhou!” Matriarch Lu said earnestly.

Hearing Matriarch Lu’s words become more and more ridiculous, Lu Nian couldn’t take it anymore. He said, “Grandma, I know my limits. I’m just worried about Second Brother’s health.”

Matriarch Lu rolled her eyes at Lu Nian. How could she believe Lu Nian’s lie?

Qiao Nian and the others quickly arrived at Song Yu’s room.

Song Yu pushed open the door distractedly, but her mind was still filled with Lu Nian’s attitude towards Qiao Nian.

She really couldn’t understand why Second Brother was so good to Qiao Nian.

Second Brother was a cold person. He would only treat his family well. Even her younger sister, who had grown up with Second Brother for more than ten years, was treated indifferently by him.

Song Yu felt that she had to investigate this matter thoroughly.

Lu Rao’s gaze landed on Gu Zhou’s face. He frowned slightly, a trace of confusion flashing in his eyes. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Today, Gu Zhou was a little different from usual.

In the past, Gu Zhou had always been indifferent and his eyes were filled with coldness. But today, Gu Zhou was different. Gu Zhou’s gaze was fixed on Qiao Nian’s face, his deep eyes filled with a strong sense of aggression.

Lu Rao was a man, so he understood Gu Zhou’s gaze very well.

He couldn’t believe that Gu Zhou really liked Qiao Nian.

Everyone followed her into Song Yu’s room.

Seeing that Qiao Nian had walked to the bed and was about to lift the blanket, Lu Rao hurriedly walked over and said, “Let me do it!”

At this moment, Gu Zhou spoke. “Let me do it!”

Qiao Nian stood by the bed. She glanced at Lu Rao and Gu Zhou and smiled. “I can do it myself!”

Song Yu glanced at Lu Rao, then at Qiao Nian. She hurriedly smiled and said, “Why don’t I do it? I’m most familiar with my bed!”

Qiao Nian’s impression of Song Yu improved a little. She shook her head gently and said, “I’m a doctor. If there’s anything wrong, I can discover it immediately. Let me do it!”

With that, Qiao Nian casually lifted the blanket.

However, under the blanket was a clean bedsheet. There was nothing else.

Song Yu frowned slightly. Her gaze landed on the dressing table and she said, “Could it be on the dressing table? I’ll go take a look!”

With that, Song Yu walked towards the dressing table. She glanced at it. There were no signs of anyone having touched it.

Song Yu pretended to open the drawer, but her gaze was fixed on Lu Rao in the mirror.

Third Brother kept staring unblinkingly at Qiao Nian. It was obvious that he had a good impression of her.

Song Yu pursed her lips slightly and recalled the time in the Buddhist hall.

Third Brother was clearly angry and upset that his sister’s urn had been destroyed, but Qiao Nian had called him Third Brother. In the end, Third Brother didn’t flare up at Qiao Nian.

It was obvious that Qiao Nian was special to Third Brother.

Qiao Nian folded the blanket and placed it aside. The bed was bare. Other than the pillow, she didn’t see anything else.

Strange, how could this be?

She knew very well that what Jiang Yue had left for her was definitely not anything good.

But she was still curious.

Qiao Nian’s gaze inadvertently fell on the pillow. Only then did she notice a smear of brown on the edge of the white pillow. If she remembered correctly, this should be the color of a folder.

Qiao Nian picked up the folder.

Qiao Nian said to Song Yu, who was still rummaging through the dressing table not far away, “Miss Song, I’ve already found it!”

Song Yu closed the dresser door and smiled. “It’s good that you found it!”

All four of their gazes fell on the folder. Qiao Nian wanted to open it now, but she remembered that Jiang Yue had left it for her alone. She decided to open it when she got back.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian put the folder away.

Seeing Qiao Nian’s actions, Gu Zhou’s eyes darkened slightly. Puzzled, he asked, “Aren’t you going to open it now?”
