Chapter 154 Unreasonable

“Senior Jiang, you’re really too kind!”

“Senior Jiang, you’re the best!”

“In comparison, Qiao Nian is truly an ingrate!”

Amidst everyone’s compliments, Jiang Yue opened the box and took out the gown inside.

Seeing the gown, the corner of Qiao Nian’s mouth curved up a little. There was a hint of a smile in her gaze.

Just like that, the black evening gown, encrusted all over with sparkling diamonds, made its first public appearance. Everyone was blinded by the gown. When Jiang Yue looked at the evening gown, a trace of surprise flashed in her eyes.

This evening gown was very beautiful, and she had immediately taken a liking to it. Indeed, only she could wear such a beautiful gown.

Yet, a trace of confusion flashed in Jiang Yue’s eyes. Why did she feel that this gown was a little too small?

Could Grandma have remembered her measurements incorrectly?

Jiang Yue touched the glittering diamonds on her gown, which were reflecting all colors of the rainbow. She could no longer look away. This gown had stolen the hearts of all the girls present. They looked at the gown enviously. However, Jiang Yue had a bad feeling about this, but she couldn’t put her finger on it.

Jiang Yue turned the gown over in her hands. Could it be that dark colors tended to appear smaller? Did she think that this gown looked too small?

Something was wrong. This was not her size.

It was impossible for Grandma to have remembered her size incorrectly.

Jiang Yue looked up at Zhao Qian, who was frowning Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Pursing her lips, Jiang Yue’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian’s figure was considered unrivaled among women. She was tall and had a slender waist. She was naturally graceful, and charming beyond words.

The ominous feeling in Jiang Yue’s heart intensified. Her grip on the gown tightened involuntarily.

Liu Yu naturally didn’t know what Jiang Yue was thinking. She said excitedly, “Yue Yue, quickly change into this gown. You’ll definitely look beautiful in it!”

“That’s right, that’s right. This gown suits your temperament very well!”

“You’ll look beautiful in it! As for some people who don’t have a tailor-made gown, they can go cry in a corner!”

“Matriarch Gu likes you so much. If she sees you in this gown, she will definitely be very happy.”

The unease in Jiang Yue’s heart gradually dissipated with those words. Her heart settled back down a little.

Even outsiders knew that Grandma would prepare a gown for her. What was there to be confused about?

Moreover, Grandma must know in her heart that Jiang Yue was the one who treated Grandma the best.

There was no way Grandma would prepare a gown for Qiao Nian. A sweet smile bloomed on Jiang Yue’s face. “I’ll go change now!”

“Wait a minute.” Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on the box containing Mr. S’s gown. “This isn’t my gown.”

Jiang Yue looked at Qiao Nian in confusion.

Qiao Nian stepped closer to Jiang Yue and said, “Don’t you think that the gown you’re holding is my size?”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Jiang Yue’s heart, which had just settled down, leaped to her throat again. She looked at Qiao Nian uneasily.

But now, no matter what, she was going to wear this gown. She had to.

Liu Yu was standing beside Jiang Yue, and heard Qiao Nian’s words clearly. With disdain written all over her face, she said, “Are you crazy? This is clearly a gift Matriarch Gu prepared for Yue Yue. Are you trying to say that Matriarch Gu didn’t prepare a gift for her granddaughter and instead prepared a gift for an outsider like you?”

Qiao Nian glared at Liu Yu, her expression cold. The aura she was exuding was frigid. Liu Yu was startled, but she calmed down very quickly. She had valuable dirt on Qiao Nian. As long as she spread the scandals Qiao Nian had been involved in, she would be able to avenge Jiang Yue!

The others were also displeased with Qiao Nian for trying to snatch the gown.

“Does this woman have no idea of her own status? She just has to snatch Senior Jiang’s things!”

“What kind of behavior is this? I wonder how her parents raised her!”

“She’s so irritating!”

Seeing that everyone was standing on her side, Jiang Yue’s mood lifted. “This isn’t my gown either. Sister Nian Nian, you’ve let down Grandma’s good intentions just like that. It’ll be your turn to give a speech soon. If you’re not wearing an evening gown, that will be very rude!”
