Chapter 1751 - 1751 Empty Castle

On the day of the engagement, the banquet hall was decorated with lights and colorful banners and was extremely lively. However, there was no festive atmosphere here now. It was empty and they felt flustered.

Lina looked at everything in front of her and had a bad feeling. She said, “I keep feeling that something is wrong.”Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Previously, she followed Qiao Nian to patrol the basement disguised as a guard. Although she was nervous at that time, she had nothing to worry about because Mark basically did not go to the basement.

But now, she felt very uneasy, as if a sheep had entered the tiger’s den.

Qiao Nian also felt that something was wrong. She raised her hand and pressed her earpiece. In a low voice, she said, “We’ve already entered the main hall. You guessed correctly. There’s no one in the room.”

When Lina heard what Qiao Nian said to Gu Zhou, her beautiful eyes widened involuntarily. She asked in disbelief, “Oh my god, you guessed this?”

Qiao Nian smiled and held Lina’s hand as they walked towards the stairs. She lowered her voice and said, “Do you think Mark doesn’t know that we went to the basement to patrol?”

Lina was stunned for a moment, but she quickly came back to her senses and asked carefully, “He, he actually knows. Why would he allow us to patrol the basement?”

Qiao Nian looked at the innocent Lina and said in a low voice, “This is Mark’s manor. His people are everywhere. Even if the president’s people are able to help out in the basement, our every move is under Mark’s control.”

At this moment, Lina felt that she was not keeping up. She hesitated for a moment before asking, “In that case, Nian Nian, shouldn’t we leave early? If we come in now, won’t we be caught by Mark?”

Lina couldn’t understand. Nian Nian was so smart. Why would she bring her here?

“Originally, these were all Ah Zhou’s guesses. However, when I saw that the door was opened so easily, I knew that Mark already knew our a cheap shot,” Qiao Nian explained in a low voice.

Lina was so frightened that her face turned pale. Every step she took seemed to lead her to hell. She was flustered and slipped.

Qiao Nian quickly helped Lina up. Then, she found a room and brought Lina in.

Lina seemed very afraid of Mark.

Qiao Nian asked softly, “Are you very afraid?”

Actually, this matter was also her fault. If she had revealed everything beforehand, Lina would probably be in a better state.

Lina breathed heavily for a long time before calming down. She stared coldly at the ground and pursed her lips slightly. She said uncomfortably, “My, my biological sister. She has always been in poor health and has a respiratory illness. That time, I went to the hospital to see her. When I saw Mark coming, I hid in the cabinet in fear.”

Lina’s eyes gradually lost focus. She seemed to have returned to that day.

Lina had been afraid of Mark since she was young. Actually, Mark hadn’t done anything to her, but she couldn’t help but panic when she saw him.

After she hid in the cabinet, she saw Mark walk in. Mark walked over to the bed and took off her sister’s oxygen mask.

Lina subconsciously wanted to rush out, but before she could move, she saw Mark looking at the closet sinisterly. It was as if Mark had x-ray vision and detected that she was there.

Lina seemed to be stared at by a poisonous snake. Her body was stiff and she did not dare to move. She was in fear.

Then, her vision darkened and she fainted. When she woke up again, she heard that her biological sister had already passed away.

Although her biological sister was not in good health and did not have long to live, if Mark had not taken off her oxygen mask, her sister might have lived a little longer.

At that time, Lina was still very young. When she woke up, she could not remember anything.

As Lina got older, she remembered that it had been eight years since her sister’s death.

Later, her mother’s health had been poor, and her father had been suppressed by Mark. She did not dare to tell her father the cause of her sister’s death, afraid that her father would lose his mind and confront Mark because of her sister’s death.
