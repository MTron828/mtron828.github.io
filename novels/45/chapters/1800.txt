The trembling man, Mick, lowered his head even more.

The president said with a faint smile, “Since you want to make a contribution so much, why don’t you go to the front lines the next time something happens?”

When Mick heard the president say this, his face went pale. He was a popular man around Mark and had recruited many subordinates for him.

He had just calculated the time and felt that Mark should come out. But after so long, Mark had not come out, so he wanted to break in and save him.

However, he had never expected that Mark would fail after planning everything so carefully.

Mike quickly said, “President, you’ve misunderstood me. I didn’t think that way. I just… just…”

Mike was so anxious that his forehead was covered in cold sweat. He clenched his fists tightly and tried to maintain his composure. “It’s just that the envoys of the other countries are very curious about what happened inside. I… I just wanted to go in and take a look. I didn’t want others to report the wrong things and affect the image of Europe.”

After he finished speaking, he said with certainty, “That’s right. That’s all. I was just worried that they’ll make random reports. President, our country’s image is very important. It’s very important!”

After Mick finished speaking, he looked up timidly at the president in front of him.

The President raised his eyebrows slightly. “Is that so?”

“Of, of course.” Mick’s legs felt a little weak.

“Hmph.” The president looked away from Mick’s face. He didn’t want to argue with him anymore. He led his personal guard to the front seat.

Then, Lina and Wright came out of the hall.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

At this moment, Lina was wearing a beautiful wedding dress and holding Wright’s arm with a smile. She exuded a noble and elegant aura.

For a moment, everyone was stunned.

The media quickly picked up the cameras in their hands and kept taking photos of Lina.

“Princess, to the left!”

“Princess, look back!”

“Princess, you’re too beautiful!”

Those photographers took photos crazily and even interacted with Lina. They wanted to take the best photos so that their pictures would become famous on the Internet.

At this moment, the others sitting below looked at Lina and were all amazed.

After Lina greeted everyone, she got someone to send Wright into the cast;e and faced everyone present alone.

She walked to the stage and bowed elegantly before saying, “I’m really sorry, everyone. My husband, Wright, is not feeling well today. He should rest first. I’ll apologize to everyone here.”

Lina’s every move was like a noble swan, making people exclaim.

After apologizing, the president walked up to speak. Lina walked to the side and heaved a sigh of relief.

If not for the sake of Europe, she would not have been willing to help Wright out to meet everyone. Fortunately, everything was over. She just had to find an opportunity to divorce Wright later.

Everything would be calm again.

Lina sat on a chair at the side and thought of Chen Qing, who had been sent to the hospital by Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian. She frowned slightly.

She wondered how Chen Qing was doing now.

The others present were still very curious about the situation in the hall, but when they came out, the door to the hall was closed. No one knew what was going on inside.

As the bride of this wedding, Lina elegantly gave a toast to everyone present.

After three rounds of wine, everyone became lively, as if nothing strange had ever happened before. They began to chat in private.

At this moment, Gu Zhou took the opportunity to go to the next room to take off his guard’s clothes. He changed into a suit and exuded a cold and noble aura. When he returned to the wine table, he attracted the attention of many people.

Gu Zhou walked towards Gu Ting without looking sideways, as if he could not see anyone else.

When the people at Gu Ting’s table saw Gu Zhou coming over, they looked at Gu Zhou and Gu Ting curiously. Seeing that the two of them looked a little alike, they began to speculate.
