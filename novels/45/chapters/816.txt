Song Man felt that she was especially smart and made up for this flaw in time.

Her reasons were reasonable and flawless.

Gu Qi did not find any loopholes in Song Man’s words. All these years, he had missed his mommy, so he was still willing to believe that his mommy was a kind and honest person.

Therefore, Gu Qi was willing to believe Song Man’s words.

!!

However, Song Man’s next words puzzled Gu Qi again and made him wary.

“Xiao Shi, didn’t Mommy tell you before that we have to work hard to find Father and your brother? Don’t you remember?”

Gu Qi nodded. He had heard about this from Xiao Shi.

Song Man sighed slightly and said guiltily, “This is all Mommy’s fault. Mommy has always felt sorry for you. If Mommy hadn’t fainted back then, you might have returned to the Gu family. You wouldn’t have to live a hard life with Mommy anymore. Mommy’s greatest wish is for you to live a carefree life, like other children, and go to school happily.”

When Gu Qi heard Song Man’s words, he was a little moved. He felt that he shouldn’t have questioned his mommy just now.

His mommy was indeed as gentle and kind as he had thought.

He shouldn’t have spoken to his mommy in such a violent tone just now.

Although he was not familiar with the woman in front of him yet, he knew that she was his mommy, the person who had given him life.

Although he really wanted to apologize to his mommy, after struggling for a long time, he did not know how to start.

Song Man stood up and walked to Gu Qi. She sat down and gently took his hand, asking tentatively, “Xiao Shi, you told me previously that Auntie Nian Nian arranged for you to stay here. Do you know why she asked you to stay here?”

When she heard Song Man’s question, she said seriously, “Auntie Nian Nian wants me to find a suitable opportunity to reunite with Daddy!”

Song Man’s heart was filled with disdain.

She didn’t think Qiao Nian would be so kind. It seemed that Xiao Shi was still too innocent. She didn’t know that humans were sinister.

With this thought in mind, Song Man said meaningfully, “Xiao Shi, you’ve been tricked. You don’t know that your appearance with me will threaten Qiao Nian’s position as the Young Madam of the Gu family. It’s impossible for her to be so kind as to let you acknowledge your father. The reason why she placed you here is because she doesn’t want you to acknowledge your father. You’ve lived in the slums for so long. Don’t you know what human hearts are like?”

“She just wants to lock you up and find a chance to chase you out of An City so that you won’t acknowledge your daddy for the rest of your life!” Song Man said with a dark expression.

When Gu Qi heard Song Man’s words, he instantly felt uncomfortable. Last night, Auntie Nian Nian had already let Xiao Shi meet her father.

Auntie Nian Nian was the gentlest and kindest person in the world. Moreover, Auntie Nian Nian had said that she would let his father acknowledge Xiao Shi.

In the past, when everyone suspected that he was depressed, it was Auntie Nian Nian who stood up and said that he was not sick.

Auntie Nian Nian would work hard to prove his innocence.

Auntie Nian Nian clearly knew that he was her father’s child, but she accepted him without hesitation.

Gu Qi replied without hesitation, “You’re wrong. Auntie Nian Nian isn’t that kind of person at all. She’s especially good and kind!”

Song Man was slightly stunned when she heard Gu Qi’s words.

She had said something wrong just now. She could understand if Xiao Shi was sad, but why was she speaking up for an outsider now? DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Now, for the sake of an outsider, she actually talked back to her.

When Song Man realized this, her expression instantly darkened. She had painstakingly raised this child. She could not speak up for outsiders!

With this thought in mind, Song Man said coldly, “When you were young, did Mommy raise you painstakingly just to let you speak up for outsiders?”

When Gu Qi heard Song Man’s words, his lips pursed tighter and tighter.

He didn’t like the way his mommy spoke to him, nor did he like her reprimanding him like this.

For some reason, when he looked at his mommy, he kept thinking of Zhang Yi.
