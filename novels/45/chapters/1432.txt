1433 Lost weight again?

“I understand.”

After Qiao Nian and Su Yan finished speaking, she was about to hang up when Matriarch Gu’s loving voice came through the phone again.

“Is that Nian Nian? I want to say a few words to her.”

Matriarch Gu’s words were filled with longing for Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian recalled that when Matriarch Gu had made a gown for her, she had tried it on. At that time, Matriarch Gu’s eyes had lit up.

Ever since she walked out of the mental hospital, the first person to treat her well was Matriarch Gu. She had experienced the warmth of family from Matriarch Gu. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but smile. There was a hint of joy in her voice as she called out, “Grandma!”

Su Yan smiled and handed the cell phone to Matriarch Gu. Matriarch Gu held the cell phone with both hands and looked at Qiao Nian on the screen. With a loving expression, she asked, “How was your meal over there? Why do I feel that you’ve lost weight again?”

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but smile. “Grandma, I just left. I haven’t lost weight!”

“You just can’t grow fat when you’re at home. Young ladies have to be chubby to be healthy,” Matriarch Gu said solemnly. Seeing Gu Zhou walk over to Qiao Nian, she called out, “Ah Zhou.”

“Grandma?” Gu Zhou had just gone to the bathroom. He didn’t expect Qiao Nian to still be video-calling Grandma when he came out.

“Take care of Nian Nian more often. Look at how thin she is. I’ve told you many times that you have to take good care of Nian Nian. If Nian Nian loses weight again when she comes back this time, I’ll settle the score with you,” Matriarch Gu said to Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou was speechless.

Matriarch Gu glanced at the living room again. Seeing that the three children had left, she said, “Nian Nian, don’t listen to their nonsense. Grandma has been through this before. When women give birth, they walk through the gates of hell. Back then, you gave birth to three children in one go. You have to take good care of your health. You can’t give birth again. Giving birth is really too painful!”

When Qiao Nian heard Matriarch Gu’s words, her heart warmed. “Grandma, I understand. Actually, Ah Zhou usually takes good care of me. Don’t worry.”

Matriarch Gu didn’t think that Qiao Nian had taken her words to heart. She said to Qiao Nian, “I’ll say a few words to Ah Zhou. Just now, he heard that the children still wanted younger siblings. He might even be secretly happy!”

Qiao Nian handed the phone to Gu Zhou, her lips curving up slightly. Now, it was her turn to secretly laugh.

Matriarch Gu looked at Gu Zhou and was about to speak when she heard Gu Zhou say, “Grandma, don’t worry. I’ve always known my limits.”

“You know your limits? Are you joking?” Matriarch Gu’s expression was tense as she said sternly, “You were so delusional back then. If it weren’t for me, I don’t know when you and Nian Nian would have been together. I’ve really been worried sick about you!”

Gu Zhou was speechless.

Grandma seemed to be right. He couldn’t refute her at all.

Seeing that Gu Zhou was silent, Matriarch Gu’s expression darkened. She said fiercely, “No matter what, we can’t let Nian Nian give birth again. When a woman gives birth, she’s already half a step into the coffin. If you let her give birth, won’t Nian Nian lose her life?”

Gu Zhou: Although Grandma’s words sounded strange, they made sense.

Matriarch Gu continued, “In the future, Ah Zhu and Ah Nian will still have children after they get married. Their children will be your children’s younger siblings!”

At this moment, the other members of the Lu family walked in. Matriarch Gu turned to look at them and said meaningfully, “Ah Zhu, you’re already so old. Why haven’t you gotten married? You should get married as soon as possible and give birth to eight or ten more children. That way, this family will be lively.”

Lu Zhu was stunned.

As for the other brothers of the Lu family, they covered their mouths and sniggered.

Lu Qi smiled and walked to Lu Zhu’s side. She raised her eyebrows slightly. “Brother, you should indeed find a sister-in-law for us as soon as possible. That way, our family can be lively again.”

Lu Zhu’s gaze landed on Lu Qi’s face. He seemed to have thought of something and said calmly, “I’m your brother. You don’t have to worry about me, but you’re still young. It’s not suitable for you to fall in love. You should study hard.”

Fall in love?

When Lu Qi heard these words, her face instantly turned red. She looked to the side shyly.
