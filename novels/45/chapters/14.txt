Chapter 15: Taking Advantage

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Qiao Xin looked at her in disbelief. Her voice shook as she said, “You… you would actually take advantage of me?”

“I haven’t done anything.” Qiao Nian gently caressed Lan’s head, her voice cold. “You set yourself up to be used by me!”

“Sister, there may have been a misunderstanding…”

“Misunderstanding?” Qiao Nian smiled coldly, her eyes flashing with disgust. “If you want to marry into a rich family, you have to pay the price. I just don’t know if you’ll be able to bear it!”

With that, Qiao Nian left, taking Lan with her.

Qiao Xin’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s exquisite clothes, and the diamond-encrusted hair clip in Qiao Nian’s hair. The envy in Qiao Xin’s eyes could not be more obvious.

All of this was supposed to belong to her. Qiao Nian stole everything from her!

But Qiao Nian’s last sentence haunted her like a nightmare, lingering by her ear. Qiao Xin began to perspire, beads of cold sweat dripping onto the floor.

When had Qiao Nian become so formidable? How dare she scheme against Qiao Xin!

Qiao Xin’s mind was in a mess as she followed the butler to the guest room.

When Butler Zhao came out of the house, she could hear the servants gossiping from afar.

“There’s more to Qiao Nian than meets the eye. She bullied her little sister until she cried!”

“She’s definitely not as straightforward as she seems. I heard that the Qiao family’s Third Young Mistress was supposed to marry into the Gu family, but Qiao Nian snatched the marriage away from Third Young Mistress Qiao. There’s no doubt—she’s not simple at all!”

“She racked her brains to figure out how to betray her blood relatives, just to marry into a rich family. There’s no way someone who did that could still have a good heart!”

Butler Zhao frowned. She snapped, “All of you are spouting nonsense! Do you want me to tell Second Young Master everything you said?”

Frightened, the servants immediately dispersed. They did not dare to go head-to-head with Second Young Master. He was so fierce! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

After reprimanding the servants, Butler Zhao turned around and left.

At this moment, on the top floor of the Gu family’s hotel…

Matriarch Gu sat idly on a chair. Wearing a pair of spectacles, she looked at the photograph on her phone. Her lips curved up involuntarily.

“Madam, Miss Zhao has arrived!” A servant stepped into the room, saying respectfully.

“Invite her in, quickly!” Matriarch Gu said with a smile, her gaze never leaving her phone screen. When she heard footsteps, she looked up and hurriedly called Zhao Qian over. “Qian Qian, look! This is your Second Sister-in-law!”

There was a flash of surprise in Zhao Qian’s eyes, but she didn’t let it show in her expression. Instead, she smiled and sat down next to Matriarch Gu. Glancing at the photograph of Qiao Nian on Matriarch Gu’s phone screen, she said agreeably, “Grandma, I’ve met Second Sister-in-law before. She’s very good-looking!”

“Indeed! I’ve never seen such a pretty young lass in my life.” Matriarch Gu’s eyes were tinged with laughter, and there were more lines on her face than usual. “I’m telling you, when I first saw her, I thought she was an angel!”

An angel?

How could that woman be an angel?

That woman was clearly evil, through and through—she was a demon.

However, Zhao Qian did not voice these thoughts. Instead she smiled and nodded in agreement. After some hesitation, she said, “But I heard that the one who was meant to marry Brother Gu Zhou was actually the third daughter of the Qiao family. Second Sister-in-law was the one who snatched this marriage from Third Young Mistress Qiao!”

Zhao Qian just wanted Grandma to hate that woman!

When Matriarch Gu heard Zhao Qian’s words, an expression of disbelief appeared on her face.

Zhao Qian thought to herself: Looks like Grandma won’t like that woman anymore!

Just as Zhao Qian was feeling smug about herself, Matriarch Gu continued, “Oh my god! This clearly means that they are a match made in heaven. She was destined to marry Gu Zhou right from the start!”

Zhao Qian could have vomited blood. Astonished, she looked toward Matriarch Gu, her throat working slightly. Before she could finish her sentence, Matriarch Gu continued, “From now on, Nian Nian will be the head of the family. When you get married in the future, she will also support you. You must get along well with her!”

Zhao Qian’s heart sank to the bottom. She frowned slightly. After hearing Matriarch Gu’s words, she finally understood that Grandma had already affirmed Qiao Nian’s place in the Gu family. If she wanted to have a status among her in-laws in the future, she would have to rely on Qiao Nian.

“Grandma, I don’t want to get married. I want to stay by your side for the rest of my life!” Zhao Qian held onto Matriarch Gu’s arm affectionately. In a fawning manner, she said, “I will take good care of Grandma.”

Matriarch Gu gave Zhao Qian a significant look. With a smile that did not reach her eyes, she said, “All grown men should find a wife, and all grown women should find a husband. Don’t spout nonsense. Go on now, I know you’re busy!”

Zhao Qian could tell that Matriarch Gu was commanding her to take her leave. After some hesitation, she stood up and walked out unwillingly.

Auntie Li, who was sitting by Matriarch Gu, frowned as she watched Zhao Qian leave. She stayed silent and placed a cup of tea on Matriarch Gu’s table.

“She still hasn’t given up on Gu Zhou!” Matriarch Gu sighed and said helplessly.
