829 Cool?

Actually, she wanted to wait for Song Man and Xiao Shi’s DNA results to come out before telling Gu Zhou about it.

At this moment, Qiao Nian’s car was parked in the parking lot of the park. Bored, she took out her phone to play games.

About an hour later, a young and beautiful girl ran to her car.

Qiao Nian remembered that this young lady was Xiao Wang’s girlfriend, Su Su.

Qiao Nian took Song Man’s DNA sample and drove to the paternity test center. This time, she personally did a DNA test on Song Man and Xiao Shi.

What Qiao Nian was most curious about was why Song Man was missing an arm.

For some reason, this reminded her of the corpse of the daughter the Lu family had found. If she remembered correctly, the Lu family had only found an arm back then.

Qiao Nian was a meticulous person, so she was thinking that she wasn’t the only one who had been kidnapped back then. Song Man was involved as well.

Why did those kidnappers break a child’s arm?

There was nothing special about a child’s arm.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but begin to suspect that the kidnappers from before weren’t human traffickers. They weren’t in the business of kidnapping children. They might be trying to sell their organs.

Her frown deepened at the thought.

If those people were in the human organ business, why would they kidnap her? She was the precious daughter of the Lu family and was doted on by the Lu family.

Could there be something secretive about this? Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Qiao Nian’s frown deepened. She couldn’t figure out what had gone wrong. In the end, she got into the car.

When she returned to the car, Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief when she realized that the wound on Gu Qi’s face had disappeared.

Qiao Nian had wanted to send Gu Qi back to the Gu family, but she remembered that she was going to the appraisal center, so she sent Chen Qing a message.

“Come and pick Xiao Qi up now!”

After sending this message, Qiao Nian sent Chen Qing a location.

“Yes, Young Madam!”

Fifteen minutes later, Chen Qing arrived in his car.

This was a new Bentley. Qiao Nian had never seen it in the garage of the Gu family villa.

However, she had already seen Chen Qing sitting in the driver’s seat.

Qiao Nian got out of the car, as did Chen Qing.

Chen Qing had a smile on his face and walked briskly. He seemed to be in a good mood.

Without waiting for Qiao Nian to speak, Chen Qing said excitedly, “Young Madam, look. Isn’t my Bentley very cool?”

Chen Qing had just brought his new car over and couldn’t wait to share it with the people he met.

Qiao Nian glanced at Chen Qing’s car and nodded in agreement. “Not bad!”

“There are many new cars this year, but I think the Bentley looks the best and has the best performance!” Chen Qing said happily. He also owned a luxury car now.

“Alright!” Qiao Nian handed the car keys to Chen Qing.

Chen Qing was slightly stunned.

“Xiao Qi is already asleep. Drive my car back to the Gu residence. I’ll drive your car out!” Qiao Nian raised her eyebrows slightly, looking at Chen Qing’s pained expression with interest.

Trembling, Chen Qing swapped his car keys with Qiao Nian’s.

At the thought that the seat he had just sat on was not warm yet, he said with heartache, “Young Madam, this is a new car. You have to be more careful when you drive it. This car is still in the adaptation period!”

For some reason, Chen Qing recalled the scene of Young Madam driving to the small villa on the Gu family mountain.

At that time, Young Madam drove very quickly. He even suspected that Young Madam was a professional driver.

This was his new car.

The reason why he said this was firstly because he hoped that Qiao Nian would drive slower. This car was indeed in the adaptation period. Secondly, he hoped that Qiao Nian would treat his new car well. This was his new car, and he didn’t want his car to be harmed in any way.

The wheels were all new.

Qiao Nian took the key and said calmly, “Don’t worry, I’ll drive slower.”

Chen Qing nodded. Qiao Nian drove the car and instantly disappeared from his sight.

Chen Qing was speechless.

How was this slow??
