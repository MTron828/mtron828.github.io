838 Angry

The car was driving so fast that her heart was beating wildly.

She could tell that Gu Zhou was really angry this time.

However, she didn’t understand why Gu Zhou was angry.

Could it be that Gu Zhou disliked her for not telling him about Song Man and Xiao Shi coming to An City?

!!

Had she delayed their family of four from reuniting?

Qiao Nian had wanted to tell Gu Zhou about this, but she was a step too late, so she explained, “Gu Zhou… I was doing a DNA test on Song Man and Xiao Shi last night. When I got the results today, I planned to tell you about this!”

Suddenly, he braked.

Qiao Nian’s body was affected by the inertia and leaned forward. Fortunately, she was wearing her seatbelt. Otherwise, she might have flown into the windshield.

She turned to look at Gu Zhou and saw that he had his head lowered. His long eyelashes hid the emotions in his eyes.

It seemed that Gu Zhou was furious.

Gu Zhou parked the car by the side again and glanced at Qiao Nian. His dark eyes were bottomless.

He had always remembered Qiao Nian’s words.

Back then, Qiao Nian had said that as long as Gu Qi’s biological mother returned, she was willing to leave.

Gu Zhou’s throat tightened, and the air gradually thinned. He felt suffocated.

“Are you prepared?” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she hurriedly nodded and said, “I didn’t want to hide it from them on purpose, but…”

“Qiao Nian!”

Gu Zhou interrupted Qiao Nian with a dark expression. His grip on the steering wheel tightened, his knuckles turning white.

He hoped that she would hide the existence of the two of them. That way, he wouldn’t have to worry about her thinking about leaving the Gu family every day!

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. This was the first time she had seen Gu Zhou like this. He was exactly the same as Gu Chuan in the past.

Had she said something wrong?

She was just stating objective facts. What had gone wrong? Why was Gu Zhou so angry?

Seeing how innocent and confused Qiao Nian looked, Gu Zhou’s expression darkened.

She hadn’t done or said anything, but she could torture him to the point of losing control.

Gu Zhou swallowed, his eyes darkening. He asked darkly, “If I hadn’t discovered something wrong with the Dongjiang villa today, how long would you have kept that woman in the villa? How long would you have hidden it from me?”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she frowned and said disapprovingly, “Even if I don’t like that woman, she’s indeed Xiao Qi and Xiao Shi’s biological mother. We can’t let her sleep on the streets, right? I heard that their lives were very bitter in the past. Besides, the Dongjiang villa is just a house. It’s empty. Let them live there for the time being…”

“You know very well that’s not what I’m thinking!” Gu Zhou interrupted Qiao Nian impatiently again. His voice was low, mixed with a trace of disappointment. His eyes gradually lowered, making it impossible to see his expression.

For some reason, when Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she felt a little sad.

Gu Zhou’s grip on the steering wheel slowly loosened. The anger on his body gradually dissipated, and he looked helpless. He really couldn’t do anything to Qiao Nian!

“Do you really want someone else to take your place? Can’t wait to leave me?”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, her eyes were filled with confusion. She hurriedly shook her head and said, “That’s not what I meant at all. I didn’t go home last night because I was doing a DNA test for them. These are the results. Here you go!”

Gu Zhou looked at the document Qiao Nian had handed him. He didn’t take it. He wasn’t interested in this woman at all. He just wanted to know what Qiao Nian was thinking.

Seeing that Gu Zhou didn’t take the document, Qiao Nian retracted it and said, “I thought Xiao Qi and Xiao Shi’s mother, Song Man, was a little strange, so I did a DNA test on her and Xiao Shi. The results indicate that she’s indeed Xiao Shi and Gu Qi’s mother.”

“What do you want to do?” Gu Zhou stared unblinkingly into Qiao Nian’s eyes, his heart aching.

“I want you to investigate what happened to her and Xiao Shi in Hai Cheng.” At this point, Qiao Nian slowly lowered her gaze and continued, “I don’t think she’s that simple. Moreover, I hope you can fight for Xiao Shi’s custody.”
