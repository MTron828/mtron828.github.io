The onlookers no longer dared to continue conversing with Qiao Nian. They were truly afraid. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qiao Nian was mentally ill. It wasn’t even a crime for such a patient to kill someone. The only thing they could do as onlookers was protect themselves.

However, their gazes towards Qiao Nian were very unfriendly.

Shen Xing couldn’t care less. The Shen family had also invested in An University. If she wanted to graduate from An University, she just had to speak to her grandmother. Even if she were to fail all her subjects, her grandmother would still have a way to change her grades.

“Qiao Nian, if you’re crazy, you should just go back to the mental hospital. You set fire to the school building five years ago. Why, do you plan to kill me now?” At this point, Shen Xing pursed her lips in disdain. “Oh my, you’re truly scaring me to death!”

When the onlookers heard Shen Xing’s words, they all covered their mouths and sniggered.

Everyone knew that Qiao Nian had set fire to the school building five years ago because of Su Yan.

At this moment, Su Yan was sitting at his seat, wearing a white suit. His entire body emitted a gentle aura. Just like the winter sun, anyone near him, or who looked at him, would feel a wave of warmth.

In addition, the Su family was also a rich family in An City. Hence, many girls liked Su Yan and yearned to marry him so that they could have his children.

Qiao Nian was thinking about Gu Zhou’s antidote. She was still short of one medicinal herb, and she hadn’t thought of what to use. She was thoroughly irritated by Shen Xing’s tantrum.

Qiao Nian pursed her red lips impatiently. Beneath her long sweeping eyelashes was a pair of cold eyes. She looked at Shen Xing expressionlessly. “Classmate Shen Xing, congratulations. You no longer have to study here. You can get lost from An University.”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Shen Xing was only momentarily stunned. Then, she looked at Qiao Nian like Qiao Nian was a big fool, and began laughing out loud.

If she didn’t know Qiao Nian’s identity, she might really be fooled by Qiao Nian.

The Qiao family wasn’t considered rich in An City. Qiao Nian was just an unfavorable daughter of the Qiao family.

She was the precious daughter of the Shen family!

How dare Qiao Nian go head-to-head with her?

Qiao Nian must not want to recover from her illness.

“Qiao Nian, do you think you’re the principal?” Shen Xing was laughing so hard that tears were running down her face. Right now, she truly felt that Qiao Nian might be mentally ill. She mocked, “Alright, alright. I’m scared. Is that enough?”

With great effort, Shen Xing managed to stop laughing. She continued, “Who do you think you are? This is not a mental hospital, and you are not the principal either. You are the unfavorable daughter of the Qiao family. You grew up in a poor village in the mountains when you were young. Have you forgotten?”

Qiao Nian stood there expressionlessly. After hearing Shen Xing’s words, she looked at her as if she was looking at a clown. She continued, “University of An won’t allow you to come in again!”

Like a snake, Qiao Nian glared at Shen Xing coldly, as if Shen Xing was her prey. It was as if she would swallow Shen Xing whole in the next second.

As the saying went, one should never admit defeat, even when on the losing side.

How could Shen Xing admit defeat? She looked up at Qiao Nian and said, “Who the hell do you think you are? You’re a lunatic, yet you still want to throw your weight around in An University. You may have been born to good parents, but it’s clear that you’re simply a beast who’s never had any proper upbringing!”

“How dare you!”

Suddenly, a majestic roar resounded from afar.

Everyone looked over and saw Principal Wang An walking over with a cold expression. He looked extremely serious, and he seemed to be exuding a righteous aura.

His hair was combed neatly, and under the gold-rimmed glasses, his eyes were fixed on Shen Xing.

When Wang An appeared, everyone fell silent. No one dared to speak.

When Shen Xing saw Wang An, she grew excited.

This was great.

The principal must have seen how arrogant Qiao Nian was. Qiao Nian would definitely be thrown out of An University by the security guards.

All she needed to do was wait to see a good show unfold for Qiao Nian.

Shen Xing straightened her back and looked at Wang An with a fawning smile. She immediately began telling tales. “Principal, you came at the right time. Qiao Nian is purposefully causing trouble on campus! She even impersonated the principal and took your seat. This is simply outrageous! You must punish her severely.. You must chase her out of the campus.”
