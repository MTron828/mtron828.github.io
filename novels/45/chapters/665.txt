A coquettish smile appeared on Qiao Nian’s face. She didn’t speak, tacitly agreeing with Lu Zhu.

That was for sure!

She couldn’t bear to let her second brother suffer.

Moreover, this was not Second Brother’s fault to begin with. If Su Sheng had not pestered them endlessly, they would have listened to Second Brother’s new song long ago.

Su Sheng had made a mistake. She couldn’t let Second Brother bear the consequences, right?

Lu Zhu looked at the smile on Qiao Nian’s face. In the end, he swallowed his reproachful words, unwilling to say them out loud.

It wasn’t easy for him to find Sugar. How could he bear to blame her?

Lu Zhu felt very uncomfortable, and his eyes gradually darkened.

His dark eyes flickered and were gradually tinged with a thick fog.

When he invited Sugar out today, she rejected him.

At that time, Sugar had told him that she had already made an appointment with someone else tonight.

At that time, he had thought that Sugar was going to meet her good friend.

But now he realized that Sugar had rejected his invitation because of Second Brother.

If it wasn’t for Second Brother’s words, he would have brought Sugar here openly tonight. Why would he let Sugar suffer?

At the thought of this, Lu Zhu glared at Lu Nian, still feeling a little upset.

At this moment, Lu Nian was in a daze. He felt that his mind was not working.

He did not understand what was going on with his brother. Was he jealous?

But that didn’t seem right either.

Who was Big Brother jealous about?

Was he jealous of him?

At the thought of this, Lu Nian felt terrible. His mind was in a mess.

It seemed that Big Brother had really fallen for Qiao Nian!

No wonder he was told that Big Brother had fallen for Qiao Nian. He had even said that he had never seen Big Brother so close to a woman.

Lu Nian’s frown deepened. He looked up at Lu Zhu, his expression becoming more and more serious. He couldn’t help but remind him, “Brother, isn’t this a little inappropriate? My Second Brother treats you quite well. How can you do this?”

Lu Nian was the second eldest son of the Lu family. The second brother Lu Nian was referring to was Gu Zhou. He had grown up with Gu Zhou.

Lu Nian recalled that his second brother had called him previously to ask where his eldest brother had gone.

It seemed that Second Brother had already realized that his eldest brother had an extraordinary relationship with Qiao Nian.

However, Second Brother did not make it clear on account of the two families.

Lu Nian pursed his lips tightly. He could not let his eldest brother ruin his second brother’s marriage.

“What?” Lu Zhu asked with a dark expression.

He had yet to settle scores with Lu Nian, but Lu Nian had said some strange things.

If it weren’t for Lu Nian not taking good care of Sugar, Sugar wouldn’t have suffered today. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Previously, Sugar had suffered alone outside.

He had initially wanted to give Sugar all the best things in the world, but because of that incident back then, he had no choice but to hide Sugar’s background.

Lu Zhu felt that he could not let Sugar return to the Lu family. He had already made Sugar suffer. He would never allow Sugar to suffer any more.

But today, Sugar had rejected Lu Nian’s invitation because of him and she had suffered again.

How could Lu Zhu tolerate this?

He didn’t make Lu Nian go home to reflect on himself because of Sugar.

Lu Nian sighed heavily. He felt that his eldest brother was being stubborn. His voice was low as he enunciated each word clearly. “I will never allow anyone to poach Second Brother’s wife, not even Big Brother!”

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Nian’s words, her mind went blank.

Had Second Brother misunderstood something?

Lu Zhu said, “Nothing good comes out of a dog’s mouth!”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. This was the first time she had heard her refined brother say such a thing.

Actually, Lu Nian did not want to say it directly, but he could not let his brother pester Sister Nian anymore. After all, he had to nip such ambiguous signs at the bud.

He did not want Gu Zhou’s marriage to be threatened in any way, nor did he want his brother to continue being so stubborn.

His gaze swept across Qiao Nian’s face and finally landed on Lu Zhu’s face. His phoenix-like eyes narrowed slightly, as if he had already seen through Lu Zhu’s thoughts.

“Brother, I know Sister Nian saved your life, but your attitude towards her is a little too gentle. This doesn’t make sense.”
