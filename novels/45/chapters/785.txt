786 I’m Waiting For You

Qiao Nian had wanted to talk to Xiao Shi for a while longer, but Xiao Shi had already fallen asleep. Xiao Shi’s lips were still curved up slightly. It seemed that she had a good dream today.

Qiao Nian carefully got out of bed and covered Xiao Shi with the blanket. Afraid that she would wake Xiao Shi up, she got out of bed.

Qiao Nian tiptoed out of the room and closed the door.

She was about to return to her room when she looked up and saw Gu Zhou standing in the corridor.

!!

She walked over to Gu Zhou and asked, “Why haven’t you gone to bed?”

“I was waiting for you!” Gu Zhou said, looking up at Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian inadvertently looked into Gu Zhou’s eyes, which were like the vast starry sky. For some reason, her heart skipped a beat.

The tips of her ears turned red uncontrollably.

She believed that no one could resist the focused gaze of a perfect person like Gu Zhou.

Before Gu Zhou confessed his love for her, the way he looked at her had never been so passionate. It made one blush and feel at a loss.

But the way Gu Zhou was looking at her now made her feel shy and want to escape.

Just as Qiao Nian was about to find an excuse to leave, she heard Gu Zhou ask, “Is Xiao Qi asleep now?”

“Yes!”

Qiao Nian nodded. A trace of hesitation flashed across her face. She didn’t know if she should tell Gu Zhou that Xiao Shi had been sleeping in the room for an hour, not Gu Qi.

Although she was not Gu Qi, the two of them were his children.

If Gu Zhou knew that he had twins, he would definitely be very happy.

“Let me tell you…”

Before Qiao Nian could finish speaking, Gu Zhou had already taken out his phone from his pocket. He opened a video and handed it to Qiao Nian. “Do you know him?”

Qiao Nian took the phone and looked at the video. She frowned slightly.

She had seen this video before.

Back in MY, this man had kidnapped Qiao Xin. At that time, Qiao Yu had thought that she was the one who had attacked Qiao Xin.

Qiao Nian believed that Gu Zhou was asking about the man in the video. She looked at Gu Zhou in confusion. “I’ve never seen him before.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s eyes. Qiao Nian’s gaze was very sincere. He could tell from her eyes that she really didn’t know the man in the video.

Gu Zhou glanced at the video and his thin lips parted slightly. “He should be your Eldest Senior Brother, Chang Feng!”

Qiao Nian was stunned. She looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief!

This man was Eldest Senior Brother?

Qiao Nian took the phone and watched the video again carefully. Her frown deepened.

“When you were telling Xiao Qi the story just now, I happened to hear your Eldest Senior Brother’s name!”

“Is his name really Chang Feng?” Qiao Nian asked uncertainly.

Although she couldn’t see the man’s face clearly in the video, the man in the video was tall and powerful, with an oppressive aura.

However, her Eldest Senior Brother was an elegant young master.

“Yes, he’s my brother’s bodyguard,” Gu Zhou said calmly.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips tightly, her frown deepening. “When Eldest Senior Brother left, he was only fifteen years old. We haven’t seen each other since!”

Qiao Nian seemed to have thought of something. Her eyes suddenly lit up as she said, “I have a photo of Eldest Senior Brother in the past. I’ll show it to you!”

With that, Qiao Nian took Gu Zhou’s hand and walked towards their room.

After walking to her room, Qiao Nian took out her wallet. Initially, there had been a photo of herself in the wallet, but below her photo was a small photo. That photo was of Eldest Senior Brother.

Qiao Nian handed the photo to Gu Zhou and said, “This is Eldest Senior Brother’s photo. Take a look and see if you can recognize him.”

Gu Zhou took the photo from Qiao Nian. It was only an inch wide. The man in the photo turned to look at the camera.

However, the photo was very blurry and he couldn’t see the man’s face clearly.

He knew in his heart that it must have been taken when Qiao Nian was young.

Gu Zhou pursed his lips tightly. He looked at Qiao Nian solemnly and said, “It’s a little blurry. I can’t see clearly!”

Qiao Nian took the photo back. She looked up at Gu Zhou and asked, “Do you have any photos of Chang Feng when he was young?”
