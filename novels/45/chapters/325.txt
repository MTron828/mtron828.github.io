Chapter 326: Shameless

Qiao Nian and Mr. Q exited the game at the same time and went to the team page.

Qiao Nian typed into the chat box. “How do I transfer the money to you?”

Soon, she received a reply. “Let’s use WeChat!”

Wang Xuan was immediately overjoyed. She was finally going to receive a WeChat message from the great god!

Qiao Nian immediately typed: “Then send me your WeChat. I’ll add you as a friend!”

Gu Qi opened WeChat on his phone and copied the WeChat number. Just as he was about to send it over, he accidentally saw a list of friends. “”

Dad.

Uncle Chen Qing.

Creditor.

Gu Qi hesitated for a moment, frowning.

He didn’t want to add a stranger on WeChat. Previously, his father had gotten him a bank card, and it was tied to his game account.

Hence, Gu Qi opened the game dialog box and sent a text over.

“Transfer it directly to my game account!”

......

When Wang Xuan saw these words, she was instantly disappointed.

Sigh.

She had thought that she could add the great god on WeChat. Indeed, she was too naive!

Qiao Nian handed the phone to Wang Xuan and said, “Link your card.”

Wang Xuan took the phone and binded her bank card before handing the phone to Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian typed a paragraph. “For the first transfer, I have to fill in the other party’s surname. May I know your name?”

“Gu.”

Qiao Nian looked at the surname and was slightly stunned. She had thought that Mr. Q’s surname would be Qiao but she transferred the money over.

Mr. Q replied, “Thank you!”

Gu Qi sat on the sofa and heaved a sigh of relief. He could finally repay the huge sum of money!

Qiao Nian had wanted to add Gu Qi as a friend, but before she could send the request, Gu Qi’s colored profile picture had already turned black and white, indicating that he had gone offline.

Qiao Nian sighed slightly. At this moment, her phone suddenly rang.

She picked up the phone and placed it to her ear, saying politely, “Hello.”

“Nian Nian…”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. This voice sounded familiar. She seemed to have heard it somewhere before, but she couldn’t remember where.

“Nian Nian, can you hear me?”

A woman’s careful voice came from the phone.

So it was Gao Lin.

Qiao Nian narrowed her beautiful fox-like eyes and asked warily, “What is it?”

In a gentle voice, Gao Lin begged, “Nian Nian, um, I’m at the entrance of the stadium right now. Can… can you tell the security guards here to make an exception and let me in?”

Qiao Nian refused without hesitation. “No!”

Gao Lin’s voice grew emotional. “Nian Nian, I really like Mr. Dong Hua’s music too much. I know you love music too. You should be able to understand my impulsiveness. I initially thought that Xia Xue would be able to bring me to meet Mr. Dong Hua, so I kept helping her. But now, I know that I was in the wrong. On account that we’re both fans of Mr. Dong Hua, can you let me in? I swear that I won’t disturb you again. I promise!”

Qiao Nian found Gao Lin’s words hilarious. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“You like Mr. Dong Hua? That’s not a reason for you to do whatever you want. My heart aches for Mr. Dong Hua right now. He’s really unlucky. He doesn’t even know who you are, yet you’ve given him all the blame for your dirty deeds. You’ve made him bear such a huge blame!” Qiao Nian said sarcastically.

Qiao Nian really couldn’t believe that there was such a brazen person in this world.

Gao Lin had already been removed from the music industry, yet she still had the cheek to call!

“Nian Nian, actually, that’s not what I meant…”

Qiao Nian’s voice turned cold. Without hesitation, she interrupted Gao Lin. “I’m telling you, don’t disturb me again. Otherwise, I won’t let you stay in An City any longer!”
