Chapter 463: Blood feud

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian’s bloodshot eyes were filled with killing intent. “Get lost!”

When Jiang Wen met Qiao Nian’s eyes, he was stunned. He hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to have such an imposing aura. She had actually frightened him.

He knew that if he really blocked Qiao Nian’s path, she would kill him without hesitation.

Jiang Wen could not believe that this aura was actually coming from a woman.

In the past, he would definitely have used any means possible to make Qiao Nian stay. However, Chief Jiang had told him not to touch a single hair on Qiao Nian’s head, so he had some reservations.

The mercenaries were also worried about what Jiang Chi had said.

Jiang Wen and the mercenaries could only retreat to the door step by step, allowing Qiao Nian to leave with Lu Zhu.

However, Lu Zhu, who was under Qiao Nian, had a blood feud with the Jiang family.

If they let Qiao Nian leave, Jiang Chi definitely wouldn’t say anything. However, if they let Lu Zhu leave, they would be the ones to die.

Jiang Wen advised kindly, “Miss Qiao, I hope you won’t go any further. If you do, the consequences will be unimaginable. Since you already know about the hatred between the Jiang family and Lu Zhu, you should also understand that Master Jiang won’t let Lu Zhu leave.” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Qiao Nian stood there calmly and said fearlessly, “Do you think I really didn’t make any preparations before coming here alone?”

As Qiao Nian spoke, she unbuttoned her shirt with her other hand, revealing the nuclear bomb tied to her waist.

The bomb wasn’t big. It was the size of a cell phone.

When Jiang Wen saw the nuclear bomb, his expression suddenly changed and he exclaimed, “Nuclear bomb 96?”

Qiao Nian smiled and said, “You have good eyes!”

A trace of fear flashed across Jiang Wen’s face. He finally understood that Qiao Nian was prepared to die with them!

Jiang Wen had never expected such a bold and meticulous woman to exist in this world. What was even more unexpected was that this woman would actually do this for Lu Zhu.

Lu Zhu opened his eyes in a daze. His gaze inadvertently landed on the nuclear bomb at Qiao Nian’s waist. His pupils involuntarily dilated as he looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief.

Qiao Nian was petite. Although he was putting all his weight on her, she didn’t seem to be struggling at all.

Qiao Nian’s beautiful face was filled with coldness.

At this moment, Lu Zhu had a strange feeling.

Lu Zhu knew that he couldn’t persuade Qiao Nian to leave at all, because Qiao Nian had already made full preparations when she arrived.

Lu Zhu clenched his fists tightly to keep himself awake. He didn’t want to be a burden to Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian continued walking while Jiang Wen was still in a daze.

The mercenaries quickly retreated two meters in fear.

Qiao Nian was tied to a nuclear bomb!

Although a nuclear bomb couldn’t compare to a nuclear weapon, its power was about the same as a nuclear weapon. As long as Qiao Nian detonated the nuclear bomb on her, the entire Ghost City would instantly disappear.

Everyone was stunned. For a moment, they did not know what to do.

Just as everyone was looking at each other, Jiang Chi walked in.

Jiang Chi looked at Qiao Nian’s determined expression and recalled the gentle look in her eyes when she looked at Jiang Cheng just now. His blue eyes were filled with gloom.

Qiao Nian’s gaze landed on Jiang Chi’s face. She also saw the disappointment in his eyes. She pursed her lips slightly and said apologetically, “I’m sorry!”

Jiang Chi’s tone was very calm, but his voice was as cold as ice. “You lied to me!”

Qiao Nian also knew that she had done something wrong. She tried her best to explain. “You can capture him for your brother, but he’s my foster brother. I can do anything for him!”

“Even though you knew that he had used such a cruel method to hurt my brother, you’re still so blindly protective. Are you helping your family instead of being reasonable?”
