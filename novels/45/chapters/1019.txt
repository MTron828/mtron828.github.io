1020 Doubts

When Auntie Cao heard Gu Zhou’s words, she was slightly stunned. She hadn’t expected Gu Zhou, who had always been ignorant of the world and had an aversion to women, to speak up for Qiao Nian.

In the past, she had heard from others that Qiao Nian was Gu Zhou’s private doctor.

At the thought of this, Auntie Cao’s gaze became sharper.

Back then, they had only found Eldest Miss’s arm. Even if Qiao Nian was Eldest Miss, she should have lost an arm.

But Qiao Nian’s arms were fine. Then who did the other arm belong to back then?

She had heard that the Qiao family was a small family. A young lady from a small family who was not favored had suddenly become Gu Zhou’s private doctor. She was even especially close to Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou had an aversion to women. No woman could get close to him.

How had Qiao Nian done it?

Or was it that Qiao Nian wanted to get close to the Gu family first, then gain a foothold in the Gu family before approaching the Lu family?

“Young Master Gu, Miss Qiao Nian is your private doctor. Don’t you think your attitude towards her is very strange?” Auntie Cao stood rooted to the ground without changing her expression. She said reasonably, “The Qiao family has nothing to do with the Gu and Lu families. Miss Qiao Nian has suddenly become your private doctor. Now, she has become the eldest daughter of the Lu family. Are there so many coincidences in this world?”

Auntie Cao paused for a moment and continued, “Everyone in the Lu family is very concerned about Eldest Miss. It’s precisely because of this that I think we should figure out everything and confirm Miss Qiao Nian’s identity.”

“It’s always strange for someone of unknown background to suddenly say that she’s the eldest daughter of the Lu family.” After Auntie Cao finished speaking, she glanced at everyone present and continued, “I’m a servant of the Lu family. I raised the four young masters and two young ladies of the Lu family myself. I don’t want them to be hurt in any way!”

When Song Yu heard Auntie Cao’s words, her eyes were filled with worry.

Gu Zhou took a step forward, his eyes filled with displeasure. “Are you questioning my wife?”

The smell of gunpowder in the air grew stronger.

Qiao Nian stood beside Gu Zhou. She didn’t speak. Right now, she enjoyed being protected by Gu Zhou.

My wife?

These words were really pleasant to the ear.

Seeing that Gu Zhou was also angry, Song Yu hurriedly said in a low voice, “Auntie Cao, you…”

“Miss Song Yu, there’s no need to say anything else. Miss Qiao Nian was originally Young Master Gu’s private doctor, and now she’s Young Master Gu’s wife. I think anyone would suspect that Miss Qiao Nian had other ideas!” Auntie Cao was just short of directly pointing out that Qiao Nian had malicious intentions!

“If there’s evidence to prove that my wife is the eldest daughter of the Lu family, will you apologize to my wife in public?” Gu Zhou’s expression darkened as he questioned word by word, “And respectfully call her eldest miss?”

Matriarch Lu was worried that Qiao Nian wasn’t the eldest daughter of the Lu family, but when she heard Gu Zhou’s words, her first reaction was relief.

Her Sugar had finally found someone who treated her sincerely.

In the future, she would no longer have to worry about Sugar being wronged.

In the face of Gu Zhou’s aggressive words, Auntie Cao had no intention of backing down. She continued, neither servile nor overbearing, “Young Master Gu, I’m a servant of the Lu family. Everything I do is for the sake of the Lu family. If Miss Qiao Nian is really the eldest daughter of the Lu family, I’ll naturally respect and love her.”

The coldness in Gu Zhou’s eyes did not diminish in the slightest. “If you don’t see any evidence, you can only ask questions. You don’t have to use such a doubtful attitude.”

Gu Zhou narrowed his phoenix-like eyes and said, “This time, my wife only came to the Lu family to acknowledge her family, not to face your doubts or have a hard time.”

His attitude was very firm!

He would never allow anyone to bully Qiao Nian, so Auntie Cao had to apologize.

Qiao Nian sensed Gu Zhou’s attitude, and her eyes were filled with smiles. It seemed that no matter where she went, she could drag Gu Zhou along. After all, with him around, no one could bully her.

Qiao Nian retracted her gaze and her gaze fell lazily on Auntie Cao’s face. Her red lips curved up slightly. “Auntie Cao?”

Auntie Cao retracted her gaze and looked at Qiao Nian, then nodded.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but laugh. She asked, “I think Auntie Cao understands the difference between dutifulness and making things difficult for people.”

When Auntie Cao heard Qiao Nian’s words, her expression faltered slightly. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

She could see the disdain in Qiao Nian’s eyes, as well as her fearlessness.

Could it be that she was really wrong?
