Although Second Young Master had been a little possessive back then, his possessiveness had not been as strong.

Now, Second Young Master was not only possessive, but also aggressive.

Second Young Master was really too dangerous!

On the other hand, when Lu Zhu received Qiao Nian’s text, his expression instantly darkened.

In his eyes, the Qiao Nian of the past was like a flower in the high mountains. No matter what setbacks she encountered, even if she was pushed to the point of being the target of public criticism, she could handle everything with ease.

But Qiao Nian had just sent a text.

Although it was only a single sentence, “Can I really?”, this pierced Lu Zhu’s heart deeply.

His heart felt as if it had been pierced by countless needles. Pain spread from his chest, growing more and more intense. It was so painful that he could barely breathe.

He took a deep breath and tried to regain his composure.

Previously, he thought that after spending so much time together in MY, he knew enough about Sugar.

He only hoped that Sugar would continue to laugh without restraint, or cry out loud. She should never suppress her true self.

He also knew that although Sugar looked strong, she was only slightly stronger than ordinary girls!

However, he did not realize that not only was Sugar not strong-willed, but she was also very fragile.

Moreover, when it came to kinship, Sugar was a little afraid. Not only was she passive, but she also appeared lowly..

Such lowliness should not appear on his Sugar.

Lu Zhu’s body tensed up, as if he had accidentally pulled on his wound. He could still feel the tearing pain, but this was nothing compared to the pain in his heart.

Seeing that Lu Zhu had his head lowered and was silent, Lu Rao frowned and asked worriedly, “Brother, are you tired from your trip back?”

Lu Zhu did not answer Lu Rao directly.

“Big Brother?”

Lu Zhu was panting heavily. His voice was hoarse, like the sound of two pieces of rough sandpaper rubbing against each other. “My chest hurts…”

It really hurt too much!

This was not physical pain.

Instead, when he thought of Sugar, his heart ached as if it had been cut into pieces.

His heart really ached for Sugar. He wished he could keep Sugar by his side and dote on her.

He wanted to give Sugar all the kinship she deserved. He wanted her to be a carefree young lady who would never be hurt by anyone.

Seeing that Lu Zhu was still frowning, the relaxed look in his eyes disappeared. Lu Rao said sternly, “Drive slower.”

When Chen Shi heard this, he hurriedly released the accelerator, and the car slowed down.

However, Lu Zhu’s expression did not improve.

Lu Rao looked at Lu Zhu worriedly and asked, “Brother, do you feel better now?”

Lu Zhu turned his head and glanced at his younger brother. His eyes were red, and his Adam’s apple bobbed. He pointed at his chest and said, “It hurts here!”

Lu Rao was stunned. Ever since Sugar left, his eldest brother had never said that he hurt.

Lu Rao was a little flustered. His brother was really badly injured this time. Otherwise, his brother wouldn’t have said such things. He didn’t dare to touch Lu Zhu either, afraid that he would hurt him. His voice became much gentler. “Brother, I really won’t disturb Miss Qiao anymore. I’m serious. Don’t get agitated.”

When Lu Zhu heard Lu Rao’s words, he felt a trace of comfort in his heart. He tried hard to smile. “Brat.”

In the past, Lu Rao would definitely have bickered with Lu Zhu, but he wasn’t in the mood now.

Ever since Sugar left, he had become more sensitive. He had always been worried that the person he cared about would suddenly disappear like Sugar and never return.

Lu Rao’s phoenix-like eyes were filled with coldness. His gaze fell on Chen Shi and he ordered, “Chen Shi, turn around and go to the hospital now!”
