1236 Ruined

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on the glass bottle. The glass bottle was covered, and she couldn’t smell anything inside.

“I think Second Sister-in-law still remembers how I looked when I was disfigured!” Jiang Yue’s gaze fell on the glass bottle, and her eyes grew colder and colder.

At that time, she had wanted to chase Qiao Nian away.

She had no choice but to scheme against her using the only thing her mother had left for her.

Jiang Yue’s thoughts were very simple. As long as she put the sulfuric acid into the perfume bottle her mother had left for her, no one would find out that the perfume bottle contained sulfuric acid, because no one would be willing to touch the belongings left behind by another person’s mother!

However, like a lunatic, Qiao Nian opened the perfume bottle her mother had left for her. It was precisely because of this that her plan had failed and her face had been ruined.

If Qiao Nian didn’t exist in this world, she would still be the young lady of the Gu family. She would still have a crush on Brother Ah Zhou and be envied by everyone.

However, Qiao Nian’s appearance had ruined everything.

Qiao Nian had ruined her home, her face, and her life.

Fortunately, she stood up again!

“So?” Qiao Nian looked at Jiang Yue’s arrogant expression and said nonchalantly.

Jiang Yue looked at Qiao Nian expressionlessly, the hatred in her eyes growing.

Was Qiao Nian crazy?!

This was her territory, but Qiao Nian still looked superior, as if nothing else was worthy of her.

She just couldn’t stand Qiao Nian, a country bumpkin, standing above her.

She was the favored daughter of the heavens. Qiao Nian was just a clown.

Jiang Yue took a deep breath and tried hard to remain calm. She said, “As long as you pour the sulfuric acid in the bottle on your face, you can walk out of the villa alive.”

When Qiao Nian heard Jiang Yue’s words, she sneered and asked, “What if I’m unwilling?”

The calmness on Jiang Yue’s face gradually shattered, and her eyes were filled with anger. She pursed her lips and enunciated each word clearly. “Then only death awaits!”

If Qiao Nian died, Gu Zhou would definitely be in so much pain that he wanted to die. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

If Gu Zhou had been as cold to her as he had been in the past, or if Gu Zhou had died earlier, she felt that her feelings for him would not have changed.

However, Qiao Nian had appeared. Gu Zhou was infinitely tolerant of Qiao Nian. No matter what Qiao Nian said, Gu Zhou felt that it was right. She didn’t like that Gu Zhou liked Qiao Nian.

The expression on Jiang Yue’s face grew more and more ferocious. She yearned to cut Qiao Nian into pieces and let her die in pain.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Jiang Yue’s face. She could clearly see the hatred in Jiang Yue’s eyes, as well as the ferocity and smugness in them.

She still remembered Jiang Yue, who used to be like a well-bred young lady. Now, Jiang Yue was like a clown.

She couldn’t help but laugh.

Jiang Yue frowned and questioned, “What are you laughing at!”

With a smile on her face, Qiao Nian said, “I just think you’re in a sorry state. It’s really like the old saying.”

“I’m in a sorry state?” Jiang Yue’s voice suddenly rose as she said in exasperation, “Take a mirror and look at yourself. You’re like a frog boiling in warm water. The water temperature is getting higher and higher. You’re a frog that’s almost cooked and about to die, but you don’t know it at all.”

Qiao Nian said softly, “You’re really pathetic. How sad.”

When Jiang Yue heard Qiao Nian’s words, she was about to explode with anger. She immediately stood up and quickly walked up to Qiao Nian, raising her hand to slap her face.

Qiao Nian grabbed Jiang Yue’s hand effortlessly and slowly stood up. When she stood up, she was a little taller than Jiang Yue. She looked down at the clown-like Jiang Yue and waved her hand.

Like a broken doll, Jiang Yue was flung to the sofa by Qiao Nian.

“Don’t touch me with your dirty hands!” As Qiao Nian spoke, she took out a tissue from the coffee table and wiped the hand that touched Jiang Yue.

Jiang Yue lay on the sofa in a sorry state, glaring at Qiao Nian angrily.

Dirty?

That b*tch Qiao Nian actually said that she was dirty!

This word was like a sharp blade stabbing into Jiang Yue’s heart.
