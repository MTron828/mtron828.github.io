When Lu Jiang heard Song Yu’s words, he looked at her with heartache. He said, “Little Sixth, don’t worry. I’ll find magnolia-bark tomorrow. When the time comes, you’ll be able to sleep well tomorrow night.”

A smile appeared on Song Yu’s pale and weak face. She said softly, “Fourth Brother, I only didn’t sleep well last night. I’ll be fine.”

Lu Jiang smiled.

Song Yu picked up the cup on the coffee table and took another sip of water. She looked at Qiao Nian and said, “Sister, I think Auntie Cao must want to use me to do something to let everyone down. I want to do as Auntie Cao says.”

When Song Yu said this, everyone present was stunned. Even Lu Nian was stunned.

“Perhaps we can catch a big fish.” Song Yu pursed her lips and said in a low voice, “I hope only the few of us know about this conversation. Only then can we guarantee that the plan can go smoothly.”

When Auntie Cao found out that Song Yu had gone to Lu Zhu’s study. she

secretly hid in the dark to investigate the situation. Not long after, she saw

Song Yu running out of the study in tears, followed by Fourth Young Master.

Auntie Cao’s lips curved up smugly, then she left.

Song Yu ran back to her room in tears. Just as she reached the door, her vision darkened and she fell back involuntarily.

Seeing that Song Yu was about to faint, Lu Jiang, who had caught up, hurriedly supported her. He carefully pushed open the door and placed her on the bed.

Song Yu slowly opened her eyes. She had only fainted just now, but she was fine now. “Fourth Brother, don’t worry. I’ll be fine.”

Lu Jiang held Song Yu’s hand tightly and said softly, “Yes, I won’t let anything happen to you.”

Song Yu gave a sweet smile.

The next day, Old Master Qin performed acupuncture on Madam President of Europe for six consecutive hours. Madam President’s complexion grew better and better, but after the acupuncture, she fell asleep.

Lina looked at Shen Mei worriedly. She was about to ask when her mother would wake up when she heard Old Master Qin say that Shen Mei would only wake up the day after tomorrow. She hurriedly thanked Old Master Qin and stayed by his side.

When Old Master Qin left the villa, he was chatting and laughing with Qiao Nian. In the next moment, he fainted.

Qiao Nian hurriedly helped Old Master Qin to the hospital. Later on, she heaved a sigh of relief when she realized that Old Master Qin had only fainted from exhaustion.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The next morning, Old Master Qin slowly woke up. As soon as he opened his eyes, the first face he saw was Qiao Nian’s teary face.

“Grandpa.” Qiao Nian looked at Old Master Qin excitedly, her voice choked.

“You’re awake. Are you feeling unwell?”

“No.” Old Master Qin smiled and shook his head. He looked at Qiao Nian’s face dotingly. “Nian Nian, I want to tell you something. Don’t be sad.”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She looked at Old Master Qin in surprise. “Grandpa, tell me.”

“Madam President probably can’t remember the kidnapping. She was hypnotized back then.” As Old Master Qin spoke, he was about to sit up.

Qiao Nian hurriedly placed a pillow behind Old Master Qin and helped him sit up. Listening to Old Master Qin’s words, she felt terrible. “Grandpa, are you saying that… she was hypnotized like me when I was young?”

“Yes, indeed.”

Qiao Nian frowned. “This…”

“Nian Nian, that person’s hypnosis ability is very strong. Other than me and your senior brothers and sisters, there’s only one person I know who can hypnotize someone like that.” Seeing Qiao Nian’s nervous expression, Old

Master Qin said directly, “My junior brother and your senior uncle, Liu Yu.”

“Grandpa…”

“So if you find Liu Yu, you’ll be able to understand the situation back then.” Old Master Qin held Qiao Nian’s hand tightly and comforted her softly. “Actually, this can be considered good news, right?”

Qiao Nian smiled and nodded.

Qin Chuan was still guarding Old Master Qin. Qiao Nian went to Lina’s place and waited for Madam President to wake up. After all, her identity was sensitive and this concerned the relationship between the two countries..
