1077 He Won’t Die

Chen Qing looked back, his gaze cold and sharp. “Don’t worry, he won’t die. It’s just a small punishment!”

Chen Qing was usually in the background, giving off a very gentle and low-profile feeling. However, in the eyes of outsiders, his eyes were filled with killing intent as if he could kill someone with a single look!

Su Xue clenched her fists tightly and took a step back uneasily, not daring to say anything.

Su Xue walked over to Xu Qiu and gently shook her arm.

!!

Xu Qiu came back to her senses. Her gaze fell on Chen Qing’s back. Her lips parted slightly, but she swallowed her words.

What should she say?

Would she be willing to be beaten up for a heartless man?

Now that the matter had been resolved, Qiao Nian smiled at Gu Zhou’s arm. Her beautiful fox-like eyes curved into crescents as she said gently, “Let’s go offer incense to Grandma now!”

At this moment, be it Su Xue, Xu Qiu, or all the servants of the Qiao family, no one dared to stop the two of them.

Su Xue stood outside. She looked indifferently at Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian’s retreating backs. At this moment, she envied Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian’s reputation had clearly been ruined a long time ago, but Qiao Nian could still be liked by her husband.

Wasn’t a woman’s greatest wish to marry a good husband?

Previously, when she married Qiao Shan, he wouldn’t be considerate to her even when he wasn’t busy. As long as she didn’t do anything well, she would be scolded by Qiao Shan.

In the past, she had thought that even if she couldn’t marry a good man, she would definitely let her daughter marry a good man.

She might have really spoiled her daughter!

It made her daughter jealous and dark.

She missed her innocent and adorable daughter in the past!

If her daughter had always been so innocent and adorable, she would not have been ruined!

At the thought of Qiao Xin, Su Xue sighed heavily. She only hoped that Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian would stop causing trouble and let the Qiao family live a stable life…

Su Xue pulled Xu Qiu and walked in!

In the Qiao family’s ancestral hall.

The ancestral hall was filled with smoke. Matriarch Qiao’s ancestral tablet was placed on the table.

When Qiao Nian walked in, she recalled Matriarch Qiao’s voice and smile when she was young!

In the entire Qiao family, Matriarch Qiao was the only one who treated her the best.

Matriarch Qiao would personally send her to and from school. She would also personally cook delicious food for her. She would also bring her to the mall to buy clothes, tell her bedtime stories, and bring her to the amusement park to play.

Most of the beautiful memories of her childhood were left behind by Matriarch Qiao.

Matriarch Qiao was not in good health. Matriarch Qiao had even specially left her 10% of her shares so that she would not be wronged in the future.

Qiao Nian picked up three incense sticks and lit them with a candle. She walked back to the middle of the ancestral hall and knelt on the futon with a plop. She looked at Matriarch Qiao’s ancestral tablet and kowtowed three times seriously.

Qiao Nian closed her eyes and murmured softly, “Grandma, I’m Nian Nian. I came to visit you today! You used to be the most concerned about me having a bad life. I want to tell you that you don’t have to worry about me anymore. I’ve already grown up and married my beloved husband. I’m very happy now!”

Towards the end, Qiao Nian’s voice was a little choked up. If she hadn’t been worried about Grandma, she would have made the Qiao family disappear from An City long ago.

After Qiao Nian stood up, she placed the incense in the incense burner and returned to her original spot to pay her respects seriously.

After Qiao Nian finished bowing, Gu Zhou also offered incense to Matriarch Qiao.

The two of them were walking out.

As soon as they walked out of the ancestral hall, the two of them saw Qiao Yu and Qiao Xin walking over!

Qiao Xin’s face was still injured. Her face was bandaged, revealing her eyes, nostrils, and lips. When she saw Qiao Nian, she subconsciously hid behind Qiao Yu.

Qiao Xin’s injured leg had yet to recover. She had been too anxious to hide just now and almost fell to the ground!

Fortunately, Qiao Yu quickly caught hold of Qiao Xin, preventing her from falling. He comforted her in a low voice, “Don’t be afraid, it’s fine!” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian ignored Qiao Yu and Qiao Xin. Just as they were about to leave, Qiao Yu stopped them!

“Wait!”

Qiao Nian turned to look at Qiao Yu. She raised her eyebrows slightly and said sarcastically, “What’s wrong? Do you think your sister has suffered again and want to stand up for her?”
