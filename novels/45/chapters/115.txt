Chapter 116: Heartache for Him

Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian’s heart ached a little for Gu Zhou.

Her brow furrowed deeper and deeper. Previously, no one knew that she had married into the Gu family as a gesture of good fortune to the family. How did everyone know now?

Now, the entire An City seemed to know that the short-lived Gu Zhou had married the lunatic Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian’s brow furrowed even deeper. Previously, she had thought that when the time came, she would leave the Gu family.

Now that her marriage with Gu Zhou had caused such a stir, if she wanted to get a divorce, it would probably be quite troublesome.

At this moment, Qiao Nian suddenly recalled something. Gu Zhou seemed to have planned to keep their marriage a secret as well.

Now that this matter had been exposed, Gu Zhou would definitely be furious.

At the thought, Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou.

‘What surprised Qiao Nian was that Gu Zhou didn’t seem to be angry. His expression was as calm as ever, as if whatever those people were saying had nothing to do with him.

“Gu Zhou is so pitiful. He didn’t manage to marry such a beautiful and talented girl like Qiao Xin, but he ended up marrying a lunatic.”

“Keep your voice down. Don’t let Gu Zhou hear you!”

“What’s there to be afraid of? Back then, he was willing to marry that lunatic. He must have been mentally prepared for gossip.”

Qiao Nian pursed her lips gently. She couldn’t bear to listen to any more of their gossip. Her eyes were filled with coldness.

The man who had been speaking ill of Gu Zhou felt someone staring at him. He tured his head and met Qiao Nian’s dark eyes.

The man’s expression faltered. If he recalled correctly, this woman was Qiao Nian, who had shocked everyone at Matriarch Shen’s banquet.

He felt a chill run down his spine and momentarily forgot about gossiping.

Actually, he wasn’t afraid of Qiao Nian herself. However, because Gu Zhou was standing next to Qiao Nian, if Qiao Nian could hear him, then Gu Zhou could too.

These people could gossip about Gu Zhou in private, but they did not have the guts to go against the Gu family in the open! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Qiao Nian walked over to Lin Tao and lowered her voice, pretending to be unconcerned. “Who’s that blonde with curly hair?”

Lin Tao followed Qiao Nian’s gaze. After some thought, she said, “I think he’s the youngest master of the Sheng family. His name is Sheng Shan.”

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze slightly.

Eighty percent of the chain pharmacies in An City were owned by the Sheng family. Qiao Nian’s eyes darkened several shades.

Qiao Nian hated it when people gossiped behind her back. Worse still, how could others refer to her marriage to Gu Zhou as one between a lunatic and a short-lived invalid? She was already used to people gossiping about her, but Gu Zhou had done nothing apart from falling ill, yet he still had to be

criticized.

Qiao Xin, who was standing in the middle of the crowd, inadvertently glanced at Qiao Nian’s face. Seeing that Qiao Nian didn’t seem to care about her at all, she heaved a sigh of relief. Pretending to be humble, she said, “I accidentally cultivated the Suranne Grass myself. I’m not as outstanding as everyone

says. Everyone, do stop praising me.”

Qiao Xin’s humility instantly made the onlookers have a much better impression of her.

“Lass Qiao, you’re too humble!”

“Young people these days are all arrogant and conceited. There aren’t many who are as humble as you!”

Qiao Xin gave a sweet smile, then turned to glance at Su Yan affectionately. Her gaze finally landed on Director Lin’s face and she said gently, “Director Lin, I initially wanted to keep this Suranne Grass as seed for the future. Brother Su Yan regards you as his idol and he admires you greatly. He wanted to

give you the Suranne Grass, so I sent it over. I hope you’ll accept it!”

Qiao Xin might sound humble and polite, but in reality, she had caused Director Lin a lot of trouble.

Director Lin really cared about this Suranne Grass. It had to be known that Nian Nian, who had always been very talented at cultivating plants, had never managed to cultivate Suranne Grass either. Therefore, he desperately wanted this Suranne Grass.

The medical value of Suranne Grass was immense!

He understood that Su Yan wanted to work with him. To Director Lin, it didn’t matter who he worked with..
