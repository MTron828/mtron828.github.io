1423 It Has Been Hard on You.

Qiao Nian glanced at Gu Zhou, who was sitting beside her. Gu Zhou had always been a taciturn person. He rarely spoke.

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian prepared to find a topic to talk about.

At this moment, Gu Ting spoke.

“I’ve already heard from your Grandma about what happened in An City.” As Gu Ting spoke, his gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face, his eyes exuding gentleness. “Sugar, it’s been hard on you.”

When Qiao Nian heard the word “Sugar”, she was slightly stunned. Only the Lu family called her that.

He called her that, making her feel especially close to him.

When she looked up at Gu Ting, for some reason, she felt that he was exceptionally close.

Gu Zhou knew that Qiao Nian couldn’t remember what had happened when she was young. He explained, “When you were young, Grandpa Lu often brought you to the Gu family. At that time, you were still very young. Everyone called you Sugar. My father called you that too. He even hugged you.”

In the past, he had heard from Grandma that his father had especially liked girls in the past, but his father only had two sons.

In his memory, his father rarely smiled at him and his eldest brother, but his father liked Nian’er a lot. Not only would he hug Nian’er, but he would also smile at her. He would also make Nian’er laugh with a funny face.

As long as Nian’er arrived at the Gu residence, her father would hug her. Even when they were eating, he would hug her and eat with her. He would even feed her personally.

At that time, his father doted on Nian’er exceptionally.

At that time, the Gu and Lu families were especially close. Grandpa also liked Nian’er a lot. In addition, his father liked Nian’er a lot, so his grandfather and Grandpa Lu arranged a marriage for Nian’er and his eldest son. Then, the two families could get along well.

At that time, his grandfather and Grandpa Lu had only verbally arranged the marriage. That day, his mother and brother were not at home, so he did not know his mother’s attitude.

Later on, her mother returned and made a fuss about breaking off the engagement. This matter was blown up, and the Lu family seemed to have heard the commotion.

Hence, Grandpa broke off the engagement between Big Brother and Nian’er and changed it to Nian’er and him.

The only thing Gu Zhou was most grateful to Bai Hui for was letting his brother and Nian’er break off the engagement. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she smiled. “I can’t remember the past. I’m sorry.”

“I’m the one who should apologize. You married Ah Zhou. As your father, I couldn’t hold a grand wedding for the two of you.” At this point, Gu Ting’s expression faltered slightly, as if he had recalled something. He frowned.

Gu Ting’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. He asked worriedly, “Have you seen Gu Zhou’s mother?”

Qiao Nian nodded slightly and said, “I saw her once a few days ago.”

Gu Ting frowned. “Did she make things difficult for you?”

Qiao Nian’s expression faltered slightly. She thought to herself that if she could avoid trouble, she should. Hence, she said, “No.”

A trace of surprise flashed in Gu Ting’s eyes, and he heaved a sigh of relief. His gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face, and in a daze, he seemed to have returned to more than twenty years ago.

At that time, Qiao Nian was still a soft and cuddly little ball. He could easily hug her in his arms, but he hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to grow up in the blink of an eye. He had heard that Qiao Nian had already given birth to three children for Gu Zhou. He had thought that Bai Hui would be unhappy because Qiao Nian was a member of the Lu family, but now it seemed that he was overthinking.

Gu Ting’s lips curved up slightly. His gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face and he said, “The two of you have already registered your marriage a long time ago. Shouldn’t you find a time to hold another wedding?”

Gu Zhou nodded and said, “Yes!”

Gu Ting had received this affirmative answer. A trace of joy flashed in his eyes, but it quickly disappeared.

After the conversation ended, the dining table returned to its previous silence. The atmosphere became awkward again.

Qiao Nian could clearly sense that Gu Zhou and Gu Ting were like strangers.

Qiao Nian’s lips curved up slightly. Smiling at Gu Ting, she asked, “Dad, it’s almost the new year. I wonder if you’re free to go home and celebrate the new year with us?”
