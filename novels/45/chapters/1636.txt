Chapter 1637 Not Worth It

Mark looked at the president and apologized sincerely in a gentle voice. "I'm sorry. I never expected Annie to do such a crazy thing. Fortunately, we've already investigated everything. Annie will be punished by the law. I hope you don't mind this. It's not worth it if this affects our relationship."

Not worth it?

Mark didn't even want his daughter, but he actually dared to talk about the worth of their relationship.

The president felt that Mark was too funny.

Mark was about to pat the president on the shoulder like an elder brother to comfort him, but the next moment, the president dodged.

Mark's hand stopped awkwardly in midair. He looked at the president in surprise, a trace of sadness flashing in his eyes.

The president's gaze fell on Mark's face. His eyes were as sharp as a cold blade. He said, "I think you know very well who the cold person is in this matter!" Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

When Mark heard the president's words, he pretended to be calm and said, "Yes, it's all my fault. I've spoiled Annie since she was young. She's now paying the price for what she did…"

The president smiled coldly and continued, "You're right. That person who wreaked havoc will ultimately pay the price for everything he did…"

He would wait to see Mark pay the price!

He would never let Mark off!

Mark sensed that the president's gaze was a little different from before. He narrowed his eyes slightly and stared unblinkingly at him.

However, this didn't matter. Even if the president had a rift with him because of this, it didn't matter. His plan was about to be completed.

At that time, who would still dare to show off in front of him?

Mark thought through the implications. He smiled gently and looked at the president in front of him. "Since the case is over, I'll go back first."

With that, Mark left with the people behind him, not waiting for the president's answer.

It was as if what he had just said was just to inform the president.

After Mark and the others left, the president couldn't help but sigh.

Qiao Nian watched as they left and her eyes gradually darkened. "The days ahead are long."

Wright, who had been following Mark, frowned when he heard Qiao Nian's words. Seeing Mark turn around, he followed suit.

Wright was wearing a black suit. He stood beside Mark like a ferocious beast hiding in the dark. At any time, as long as Mark gave the order, he would risk his life to bite his prey.

Mark was tall and had obvious European characteristics. With one hand in his pocket, he looked less noble. Instead, he looked colder and stronger, making people fear him.

Mark lowered his gaze slightly, looking down at the world. He ignored the president standing at the side and his gaze fell on Qiao Nian's face.

It was said that the women in Country Z were gentle,harmless and small minded. However, the girl who had just spoken was completely different from the women in Country Z he had seen before.

Her facial features were exquisite. Compared to European women, she looked more like an angel. However, angels were naturally compassionate and there was an unruliness about her. The sharpness in her eyes was very obvious.

Interesting.

Mark's lips pursed slightly, and there was a trace of admiration in his eyes. He had only attended court as a matter of routine. He didn't expect to meet such an interesting woman.

Men liked to conquer the world and women.

Mark was no exception.

Mark didn't like gentle little white flowers. He liked roses with thorns. When he saw Qiao Nian, his blood boiled.

If she had been by his side back then, wouldn't his grand ambition have been completed long ago?

All these years, he had supported Annie and Wright. These two people were so stupid that he couldn't help but have a headache.

Qiao Nian narrowed her eyes slightly. She didn't understand why Mark looked so happy.

Was there something wrong with his brain? His daughter was about to die, but he was still happy.

Qiao Nian's eyes darted around. She took a step forward and asked, "Earl, I have something to consult you about."
