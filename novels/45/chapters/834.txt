After Gu Zhou inserted the charger cord, he was about to turn it on when he realized that the battery was too low to turn it on. He could only wait.

About a minute later, he turned on his phone and called Qiao Nian.

However, Qiao Nian’s phone was in the middle of a call. After hanging up, she called two more times. The situation was identical.

Gu Zhou was about to arrive at the Dongjiang villa. He decided to call Qiao Nian later!

When the car stopped at the entrance of the Dongjiang villa, Gu Zhou and Chen Qing got out.

The two of them walked to the entrance of the villa. Just as Chen Qing was about to press the password to unlock it, the door suddenly opened.

Xiao Shi ran out happily and called out happily, “Auntie Nian Nian, you…”

When Xiao Shi realized that it was Gu Zhou standing at the entrance of the courtyard, she was stunned on the spot. The smile on her face gradually froze.

Oh my, why was Daddy here?

Xiao Shi was not ready to see her father. She looked at Gu Zhou and blushed uncontrollably. She immediately lowered her head and remained silent.

Previously, when she pretended to be her brother to meet her father, she had acted very calmly because her father did not know of her existence.

Now that her father had seen her, what should she do?

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on the young lady’s face. Her voice was soft and sweet.

When he saw the little girl’s face clearly, he was slightly stunned. His pupils constricted.

Everything around him seemed to have quietened down.

She was the only one in his world.

Chen Qing looked at the young lady in front of him in disbelief.

What was going on?

How could Young Master be here?

Previously, he had already carried Young Master back to his room to rest. If Young Master went out secretly, it would definitely not escape the eyes of the Gu family’s security guards.

Was he hallucinating?

Chen Qing rubbed his eyes. When he opened them again, he realized that he had not seen wrongly.

Gu Zhou called out tentatively, “Xiao Qi.”

Xiao Shi clenched her fists tightly in front of her. She pursed her lips tightly, not knowing how to answer her father’s question.

Seeing that the young lady in front of him was silent, Gu Zhou turned to look at Chen Qing and asked in confusion, “Are you sure you brought Xiao Qi home?”

Chen Qing nodded vigorously and said with certainty, “Second Young Master, don’t worry. I really picked up Little Master, and I personally carried him back to his room. If Little Master had sneaked out, the security guards in the Gu family villa should have discovered that he had run away long ago.”

To be precise, the Gu family’s villa was surrounded by private property. Outsiders were not allowed to enter.

According to Young Master’s walking speed, it would take him at least three hours to walk out of the Gu family villa.

Hence, Chen Qing was completely certain that this young lady was not Little Master.

Chen Qing took a closer look at this young lady. She didn’t seem to have any makeup on her face, so he ruled out the possibility of her putting on makeup.

Apart from that, the young lady’s facial features were exactly the same as Little Master’s.

He had heard from others in the past that two strangers might look very alike, but it was rare for them to be about the same age.

Could it be that Little Master and the young lady in front of him were biological siblings?

In other words, Little Master’s biological mother had given birth to a pair of twins.

Of course, Gu Zhou had also thought of this. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Gu Zhou recalled that day when Gu Qi had pestered him to tutor his homework. At that time, he had thought that Gu Qi had walked out of his depression, which was why his personality was completely different from usual.

Now that he thought about it carefully, even if Gu Qi was no longer depressed, he should still be a calm child. It was impossible for him to often wheedle at him.

Could it be that the child Qiao Nian had brought back last time was this young lady in front of her?

“Xiao Shi, who exactly is here!”

At this moment, a gentle female voice came from the villa.

Gu Zhou’s expression changed slightly, and his body stiffened.

An unfamiliar woman with a child who looked exactly like Gu Qi. He didn’t need to think to know who the woman in the room was.

At this moment, there was a sudden brake not far away.
