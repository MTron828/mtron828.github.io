Chapter 412: Her Disguise

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Only then did Qiao Nian pick up the blanket at the side and carefully cover Gu Zhou with it.

Gu Zhou accepted it calmly.

Only then did Qiao Nian heave a sigh of relief. She covered him carefully with the blanket before climbing into bed. With her back facing Gu Zhou, she lay down and covered herself with the blanket, curling up in a safe position as she prepared to sleep. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian’s posture beside him and thought of how she had covered him with the blanket. His anger dissipated a little.

Qiao Nian frowned slightly, as if she had thought of something. She turned to look at Gu Zhou and smiled obediently. “I have something to do tomorrow too. You’re injured now. Why don’t you rest early?”

When Gu Zhou met Qiao Nian’s sparkling eyes, he had a different feeling in his heart, but he didn’t show it on his face.

Qiao Nian turned off the lights tentatively. Seeing that Gu Zhou had not spoken, the uneasiness in her heart dissipated. She closed her eyes and prepared to sleep.

A little too much had happened tonight.

She wasn’t afraid of Gu Zhou. She just felt that if Gu Zhou was crippled, the Gu family wouldn’t be able to continue their lineage. She felt sorry for her grandmother and the Gu family.

Fortunately, he was fine.

“Qiao Nian!”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s voice, her heart skipped a beat.

Other than that, Gu Zhou’s voice was really pleasant, especially when he called her name.

“Why are you so averse to anyone approaching you?”

Gu Zhou had long realized that as long as others approached her, she would involuntarily become nervous.

In his impression, Qiao Nian should be calm and composed but like every time he approached her, she would look innocent and harmless, as if she was using this method to hide the fear in her heart.

If she did this once or twice, he could understand it as a joke. However, she did it every time, making him feel that this matter was not that simple.

Unless she had been hurt in a similar way before, and it had caused her to react reflexively as a protective mechanism?

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, her heart couldn’t help but race, and her beautiful fox-like pupils gradually constricted.

Although she knew that Gu Zhou was really asking her sincerely, his tone rose slightly, and was unquestionable.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips tightly. That night five years ago had been lingering in her mind. Her body had long learned to resist!

But she did not want to tell anyone about these things.

To her, this was an extremely dirty past!

After Qiao Nian composed herself, a smile appeared on her face. She pretended to be casual and said, “That’s because I’m shy. I’m not ready to…”

Qiao Nian didn’t finish speaking, but Gu Zhou could tell what she meant.

“Oh,” Gu Zhou replied, clearly not believing Qiao Nian’s words.

Qiao Nian lowered her eyes slightly, saying nothing.

Seeing that Qiao Nian didn’t respond, Gu Zhou didn’t ask further. He closed his eyes and prepared to rest. Not long after, he fell asleep.

Gu Zhou was asleep, but Qiao Nian was suffering from insomnia.

Was her revulsion so obvious?

Gu Zhou realized that something was wrong with her.

A trace of pain flashed across Qiao Nian’s eyes, but she had clearly tried her best to restrain herself.

However, every time she thought about that night and the innocent child who had died tragically, she could not calm down.

No matter what, she had to find that man!

MY was a chaotic city, and the people here were the most well-informed. Qiao Nian thought that perhaps she could use the informants here to investigate what had happened back then.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian gradually fell asleep.

At the side, Gu Zhou, who was originally breathing evenly and was supposed to be asleep, slowly opened his eyes. He turned to look at Qiao Nian, his gaze landing on her quiet side profile. A trace of confusion flashed across his eyes.

When he had held her waist just now, he had actually felt a familiar feeling, reminding him of the girl who had been forced to accept him five years ago.
