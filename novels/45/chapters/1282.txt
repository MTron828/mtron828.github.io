1283 Waiting for Uncle Feng

“Xiao Bao, let’s go home first. I’ll call your Uncle Feng. When the time comes, I’ll ask him when he’ll pick you up, okay?” Qiao Nian coaxed gently.

“No.” Xiao Bao’s eyes gradually turned red. His small hands gripped his pants tightly, causing many creases in the fabric of his pants, just like his heart, which was now clenched into a ball. “Uncle Feng said that he would pick me up. I’m not going anywhere. I’ll wait for Uncle Feng here.”

Uncle Feng had never lied to him. He trusted Uncle Feng.

Seeing how sad Xiao Bao was, Qiao Nian took out her phone and sent a code to Chang Feng.

However, the code she sent showed that it failed. That meant that Eldest Senior Brother had already changed the code in order not to contact her.

Eldest Senior Brother was also famous in the hacker world. If Eldest Senior Brother changed the code, even she would find it difficult to decipher it.

Qiao Nian’s eyes gradually dimmed. It seemed that Eldest Senior Brother really didn’t intend to bring Xiao Bao back.

Qiao Nian glanced at the time on her wrist. She couldn’t tell Xiao Bao the truth now. Xiao Bao was still young and didn’t know anything. She walked up to him and said softly, “Xiao Bao, it’s not safe outside. Mommy will bring you home, okay? Tomorrow, Mommy will send you back, okay? Do you still remember where you lived before?”

“I…” Xiao Bao had just said a word when he still couldn’t say the word “I remember”.

Uncle Feng had said that he wanted him to forget everything about his life in MY. He was not allowed to reveal the location of his father’s villa. He even said that if he told his mommy, his father might be in danger.

Xiao Bao’s eyes grew redder and redder. He bit his lip, trying hard to control his tears.

Qiao Nian looked at Xiao Bao with heartache. If they were in the country, she would definitely wait with Xiao Bao, even if she wouldn’t be able to see Eldest Senior Brother.

However, this was MY. MY was a very chaotic place. It was fine during the day, but it was very dangerous at night.

Moreover, this was Cui Huai’s territory. Cui Huai still wanted their lives.

Qiao Nian placed Xiao Bao on her lap and covered him with her windbreaker. She said softly, “Xiao Bao, it’s already so late. If your Uncle Feng comes over, he might catch a cold. Why don’t we get him to pick you up tomorrow?”

“Mommy,” Xiao Bao called out.

“Hm?”

Xiao Bao slowly raised his head. Under the street lamp, his beautiful eyes were sparkling with tears as he asked pitifully, “Daddy and Uncle Feng…”

His voice cracked as he spoke. He sniffled. “Do they not want me anymore?”

Qiao Nian’s heart seemed to be gripped tightly by an invisible hand. It hurt terribly. She looked at Xiao Bao’s red eyes and realized that Xiao Bao really relied on her eldest senior brother.

He still remembered his father’s complicated gaze in the morning. At that time, he felt that his father had something on his mind, but his father said that he was fine. It seemed that his father planned to let him leave at that time.

This morning, Uncle Feng told him to be obedient and sensible and to listen to his mommy and second daddy. He had even asked him to get along with his brother and sister. He had thought that Uncle Feng was giving him a daily reminder like before, but now it seemed that Uncle Feng was saying goodbye to him again.

At the thought that Uncle Feng would not pick him up and that he would never see his father again, Xiao Bao’s heart felt as if it had been pierced by a knife.

He didn’t understand. Why could other people’s parents be together?

When he had a daddy, he couldn’t acknowledge his mommy. When he had a mommy, he couldn’t be with his daddy!

Was this the price he had to pay? Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Xiao Bao was so sad that tears fell. He only wanted to live with his parents. Why was it so difficult?

Seeing how sad Xiao Bao was, Qiao Nian hurriedly patted his back gently to comfort him. She said gently, “Xiao Bao, don’t worry. We’re separating now for the sake of a better reunion in the future. After their matters are settled, we can all be together.”

Xiao Bao cried silently. He was a man now. He would only cry this once. He would not cry again.

Qiao Nian felt that her clothes were a little wet. She realized that Xiao Bao was trembling slightly. Her heart ached as she looked at Xiao Bao in her arms.
