Chapter 148 He’s Here

Although she knew that these people bore no ill intentions, she still felt a little uncomfortable listening to them speak.

An outstanding man like Gu Zhou should not have his life cut short, nor should he be the target of dinnertime gossip.

When she got home tonight, she would definitely think of a way to treat Gu Zhou’s illness.

“Nian Nian.” Lin Tao finally saw Qiao Nian. She picked up her skirts and ran towards her.

Lin Tao saw that Qiao Nian was dressed very casually today. If one didn’t take a careful look, one would think that she was a member of the service staff here.

Lin Tao said disapprovingly, “Why aren’t you wearing an evening gown? That’ll be rude.”

Qiao Nian smiled and explained, “My gown is on the way here. I’ll change into it when we get there.”

Most people would choose to change into their evening gowns when the banquet started. As it was still early, no one would notice her either.

At this moment, there was a sudden commotion in the crowd.

Qiao Nian and Lin Tao looked in the direction that everyone was looking.

When Qiao Nian saw the newcomer’s face, she couldn’t help but frown. Her breathing quickened.

Certain memories she didn’t want to recall appeared in her mind’s eye all of a sudden.

Qiao Nian took a deep breath, trying hard to calm her breathing. Whenever she saw him, she would feel uncomfortable.

Qiao Yu. Why had he returned? Surprisingly, she hadn’t heard anything to do with his arrival.

Qiao Xin, who was wearing a pink gown, walked in with Qiao Yu.

Qiao Xin stood beside Qiao Yu and took his arm. She raised her chin proudly, as though she had recovered the dignity she had lost previously.

Lin Tao was slightly stunned. She turned to look at Qiao Nian. “Nian Nian, your brother is here!”

Qiao Yu looked the same as before. He was wearing a well-tailored suit, gold-rimmed glasses, and had his hair combed back. He seemed like an exceptionally rigid person, even dull, but his eyes were filled with ruthlessness.

Qiao Yu had a gentle and refined smile on his face. From afar, he looked like a polite gentleman.

But Qiao Nian knew that this man was definitely not as simple as he seemed.

If she hadn’t seen Qiao Yu again, she would have practically forgotten about him.

Gu Zhou sensed that something was wrong with Qiao Nian’s expression as she looked at Qiao Yu. His eyes darkened slightly.

Qiao Yu, who had just entered, also glimpsed Qiao Nian. He walked towards her and stopped in front of her, looking down at her with contempt.

“You’ve grown up.”

Qiao Yu’s voice was cold. He looked at Qiao Nian if he were looking at a stray dog.

Qiao Nian hated it when Qiao Yu acted like this. He was so high and mighty, and treated her as if she were less than human. She still remembered how Qiao Yu had looked at her like this when she was five.

Qiao Xin had a smug smile on her face. She could naturally sense Qiao Nian’s shock and dazedness upon coming face to face with Qiao Yu. She could also sense the strong aura Qiao Yu was exuding

At this moment, Qiao Xin’s vanity had gone off the charts. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Qiao Xin felt that Qiao Nian was just Qiao Nian —a cheap woman who belonged to the lower class. She would never be a presentable lady. Qiao Nian wasn’t even wearing an evening gown today. She looked just like a waiter.

How humiliating! With a cold smile on her face, Qiao Xin asked, “Sister, Brother is back. Do you want to go home for dinner tonight?”

Qiao Yu stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian. His expression seemed to be forcing Qiao Nian to agree. “I’m just staying for a few days…”

“She doesn’t have time.” A low, hoarse voice interrupted Qiao Yu. That voice was calm, and the powerful aura in his words stunned everyone present.

For some reason, Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat. She turned to look at Gu Zhou, who was standing behind her.

All her attention was on Qiao Yu just now, and she didn’t notice that Gu Zhou had already arrived.

When Qiao Yu faced Gu Zhou, he showed no signs of backing down. Indeed, he did not seem frightened at all. Instead, he asked, “Mr. Gu, what right do you have to restrict her freedom?”
