1001 Happiness

Today was the happiest day for Lu Jiang. Not only had he found his long-lost sister, but he had also seen her child! RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Speaking of this, Lu Jiang remembered that his sister had given birth to a total of two children.

Lu Jiang smiled at Xiao Shi and asked gently, “Why are you alone? Where’s your brother?”

He wondered who his nephew looked like. Did he look like his sister? Or did he look like Gu Zhou?

!!

Xiao Shi said obediently, “Brother prefers a quiet environment, so he’s staying in his room!”

Prefers a quiet environment?

Lu Jiang’s mind raced. Suddenly, he seemed to have thought of something. He frowned slightly and asked worriedly, “Does he not like crowds?”

Xiao Shi nodded.

When Gu Zhou heard Lu Jiang’s question, he recalled Gu Qi’s expression and heaved a sigh of relief. He said helplessly, “For some reason, Xiao Qi is a little autistic. He’s unwilling to interact with too many people, nor is he willing to interact with others!”

Could it be autism?

At the thought of this, Lu Qi’s expression suddenly changed. She hurriedly asked worriedly, “Did you take Xiao Qi to see a psychiatrist? Did the psychiatrist give you a treatment plan? I heard that it’s easier to treat autism in children. You should treat them early!”

Xiao Shi was a little anxious. She hurriedly shook her head and explained seriously, “It’s not like that. Brother doesn’t have autism. Brother just doesn’t want to interact with others. He’s a genius. Moreover, I’ve seen on television and in books that geniuses themselves don’t want to interact with others!”

Xiao Shi said in a childish voice, but she was afraid that no one would believe her. “I’ve told Brother that I’ll be his doctor in the future. I’ll enlighten him. I can definitely make Brother more cheerful!”

Qiao Nian looked at Xiao Shi and was touched. Her heart warmed. Xiao Shi was really a little angel. She was too kind.

Lu Qi was so touched that her eyes turned red. She looked at Xiao Shi, who was five years old. This child was still so young, but she had already learned to take care of her brother. It was unbelievable.

Lu Qi sniffled and moved closer to Xiao Shi, gently kissing her forehead. “Our Xiao Shi is so amazing. She has already learned to take care of her brother. I hope that Xiao Shi can be smarter in the future and help her parents take care of Brother, okay?”

Xiao Shi nodded seriously, as if she really took Lu Qi’s words to heart.

Although Lu Qi and Lu Jiang both hoped to see Gu Qi as soon as possible, they were afraid that they would agitate Gu Qi, so they didn’t say that they wanted to go upstairs to see him.

Lu Jiang looked at Qiao Nian and asked, “Now that we know that those people know that you’re still alive, you should return to the Lu family. When do you plan to visit Grandma? Grandma misses you all day!”

“After some time, I’ll give them a surprise!” Qiao Nian smiled.

Lu Jiang’s thoughts were very simple. Since he had already found his sister, he should prepare for her return home. He couldn’t let others think that the Lu family didn’t care when the eldest daughter of the Lu family returned.

He wanted to hold a lively banquet for Qiao Nian’s return home. He wanted everyone to know that the eldest daughter of the Lu family had really returned.

Lu Qi and Lu Jiang looked at Xiao Shi before leaving reluctantly.

When Lu Jiang left, he couldn’t help but kiss Xiao Shi’s chubby face. In the end, Xiao Shi was angry and teary-eyed. No matter what, she refused to let Lu Jiang hug her.

Qiao Nian hugged Xiao Shi and asked in confusion, “Xiao Shi, why are you crying?”

“How annoying. Xiao Shi is a good child. Good children can’t kiss boys…” Xiao Shi said, sobbing. “But Uncle insisted on kissing me. I couldn’t stop him…”

When Lu Jiang heard Xiao Shi’s words, he felt that this child was especially interesting. He couldn’t help but laugh out loud. “I’m your uncle, not a boy!”

“But Uncle’s gender is different from mine, so he can’t kiss me!” Xiao Shi pouted and said stubbornly, “I can only kiss my biological father and brother. No other man can kiss me. Everyone says that men and women shouldn’t touch each other. When I grow up a little more, I don’t think I can kiss my biological father and brother anymore.”
