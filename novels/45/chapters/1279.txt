1280 Amazing

When Xiao Bao heard Qiao Nian’s words, his pupils dilated involuntarily. He said in disbelief, “Mommy, you’re amazing. You guessed it so quickly!”

Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat. She hugged Xiao Bao tightly, her emotions complicated.

Xiao Bao really did not expect his mommy to find out that he had saved her. Mommy was really smart. “Mommy, how did you find out?”

Gu Zhou handed the steel bullet to Xiao Bao and said, “When we were in the villa, someone used the same steel bullet as the one in our hands.”

Xiao Bao looked at the steel bullet in Gu Zhou’s hand and took it back. “Thank you, Second Daddy. Daddy said that my steel bullets can be used repeatedly. They can hit bad people several times!”

“Moreover, the steel bullet and your gun have the same patterns, so we know that you saved me.” As Qiao Nian spoke, she leaned over and kissed Xiao Bao’s forehead. “Thank you, Xiao Bao. Xiao Bao is amazing!”

Xiao Bao’s heart was filled with pride. He kissed Qiao Nian’s cheek and his gaze fell on the roller coaster in front of him. He had seen roller coasters on television in the past. Many people on television said that roller coasters were especially interesting.

He had always wanted to ride a roller coaster, but his father was worried about his personal safety and had never been willing to let him on one. Now, he finally had a chance to ride a roller coaster.

“Mommy, let’s go ride the roller coaster!” Xiao Bao said excitedly.

Qiao Nian looked up at the roller coaster beside her. Just now, a car had sped past on the track, causing the wind to mess up Qiao Nian’s hair. She frowned imperceptibly and said worriedly, “Will it be very dangerous?”

“Mommy, this is just a ride. It’s not dangerous at all.” Xiao Bao smiled happily. Then, he looked at Gu Zhou and asked happily, “Second Daddy, let’s play together!”

When Gu Zhou heard Xiao Bao call him, a gratified smile appeared in his eyes. It seemed that Xiao Bao still cared about him. He nodded and agreed. “Okay!”

Once again, Chang Feng stood in a building not far away, holding a pair of binoculars. He watched as Xiao Bao happily chatted with Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou. At this moment, Xiao Bao was smiling so much that his eyes were curved into crescents. Xiao Bao’s eyes were filled with joy, and his lips curved up involuntarily.

For Xiao Bao to be able to be with Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou, he was really happy for him.

However, when he thought of how Xiao Bao would never be able to return, the smile on Chang Feng’s face froze on the spot. He looked at Xiao Bao not far away with red-rimmed eyes, and his heart seemed to have been hollowed out.

After a long while, Chang Feng retracted his gaze and was about to go back when his phone rang.

Chang Feng took out his phone. When he saw the caller ID, he picked up without hesitation.

…

Sitting in the study of the villa, Mr. Chen’s gaze fell on the photo on the desk. In the photo was Xiao Bao’s bright smile. The moment the call went through, he tried hard to remain calm. “Have you sent him over?” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Mr. Chen’s voice sounded hoarse. If one listened carefully, they could hear the loneliness in his words.

“Yes, I did.”

Mr. Chen tightened his grip on the cell phone. “Is he very happy?”

“Yes, he’s very happy.”

Hearing Chang Feng’s reply, Mr. Chen picked up the photo on the table and looked at it as if he had seen Xiao Bao. Then, he picked up the lighter and watched as Xiao Bao’s photo burned in front of him. Then, he threw the burning photo into the ashtray and watched quietly as Xiao Bao’s photo disappeared.

“Come back. There’s something else.” After hearing Chang Feng say “Okay”, Mr. Chen hung up without hesitation.

At this moment, there was a knock on the door.

Mr. Chen sighed and quickly returned to his usual calm self. “Come in.”

Butler Zhao walked in. Seeing Mr. Chen sitting at the desk reading documents, he said in a low voice, “Little Master’s personal belongings have all been destroyed, leaving no traces.”

“Yes.” As Mr. Chen spoke, he signed the document and looked up at Butler Zhao. “Where are those people?”
