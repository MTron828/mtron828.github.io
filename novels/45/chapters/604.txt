However, this didn’t matter. She already knew what Mr. Dong Hua looked like.

Perhaps only she knew this little secret!

Mr. Dong Hua must be Lu Zhu!

She had evidence.

That time, when Senior Sister was accidentally drunk, she took the opportunity to hypnotize her.

Senior Sister could casually give her a copy of Mr. Dong Hua’s limited edition album. In that case, Senior Sister might know Mr. Dong Hua.

Ever since she heard Mr. Dong Hua’s song, she had been deeply in love with it. She treated the song as a part of her life. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

She was also getting more and more curious about who Mr. Dong Hua was. Therefore, when she had the chance, she began to search for the truth.

“Senior Sister, do you know Mr. Dong Hua?”

“Hm.”

“Who is Mr. Dong Hua?”

“Mr. Lu…”

When she asked this question, she was so nervous that her heart was about to jump out of her chest. Her breathing also quickened.

Mr. Lu.

Senior Sister was especially close to Lu Zhu, and they were schoolmates.

At that time, she was completely stunned.

In the beginning, she had treated Mr. Dong Hua as her idol, a god, and an elder. That was because she felt that Mr. Dong Hua might be an old man.

No matter how much she liked Mr. Dong Hua’s music, she had never liked him.

However, when she found out that Mr. Dong Hua was Lu Zhu, she could not calm down.

Lu Zhu.

He was a famous figure in An City. At a young age, he was extremely wealthy.

There were very few men in this world who were rich, powerful, and talented.

Su Sheng’s lips curved up slightly. When she realized that the idol she admired was someone close to her, she could no longer remain calm.

Every song Mr. Dong Hua had composed had been deeply engraved in her heart.

It seemed that only she knew Mr. Dong Hua’s true identity. She had to strike first. She had to take down Mr. Dong Hua first.

At the thought of this, Su Sheng’s eyes were filled with joy.

Out of the corner of her eye, Qiao Nian inadvertently noticed the smile on Su Sheng’s face. She looked as if she had secretly eaten honey. Only a woman in love would look like that.

Strange. This song was clearly very sad. Why was she so happy?

Could it be that Su Sheng’s liking for music had already surpassed that of ordinary people? Had she already reached the point where her soul and music could fall in love?

This was not something ordinary people could achieve.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but smile. For some reason, she felt a little proud. Second Brother’s music was well-liked.

Su Sheng drove. When the car entered the Gu family’s villa, the relaxed expression on her face gradually disappeared. She asked uneasily, “Miss Qiao, should we show some identification before we can enter?”

“There’s no need. Just let me know,” Qiao Nian said with a smile. The security guards of the Gu family villa already knew her. There was no need to show any identification.

Su Sheng smiled politely, still feeling uneasy.

The car drove smoothly.

The more Su Sheng drove, the more careful she became. When she was about to reach the Gu family villa, she saw a security booth from afar. Her heart jumped to her throat.

When the security guard saw an unfamiliar car, his expression instantly turned serious. He immediately stood up and prepared to intercept it.

But as the car approached, he saw Qiao Nian in the passenger seat. He slowly sat back down.

Su Sheng naturally saw all the security guards’ actions. A trace of confusion flashed in her eyes. Soon, she realized that it must be because the security guards had seen Qiao Nian.

This time, the security guards didn’t even stop her. Only then did Su Sheng realize that Qiao Nian’s status in the Gu family wasn’t low.

She smiled and asked tentatively, “Is it so easy to enter the Gu family villa?”

“I’m the doctor of the Second Young Master of the Gu family. I come here often, so the security guards all know me,” Qiao Nian explained calmly.

Su Sheng was slightly surprised. Then, she asked in disbelief, “So you’re a doctor too?”

“Yes, but I’m not a psychiatrist. I hope Doctor Su can take a look at Little Qi’s mental health,” Qiao Nian said with a smile.

“No problem.” Su Sheng smiled brightly. She was familiar with this aspect.

The car stopped outside the villa. Su Sheng and Qiao Nian got out of the car and walked in.

This was the first time Su Sheng had come to the legendary Gu family villa.
