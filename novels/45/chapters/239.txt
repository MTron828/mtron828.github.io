Chapter 240: I Disagree

However, Ye Ran looked at Professor Zhang’s cold face and didn’t know what to say. She was afraid that she would accidentally anger Professor Zhang. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Wang Xuan looked at Ye Ran’s deflated expression and felt extremely happy. She wanted to give Qiao Nian a thumbs up, but this wasn’t the right time.

If she had been able to learn one-third of Qiao Nian’s skills back then, she would have pressed Ye Ran to the ground long ago.

Ye Ran was worried that if she didn’t explain herself clearly now, Professor Zhang’s impression of her might worsen. She bit her lip. “Professor Zhang, actually, I…”

Professor Zhang’s frown deepened and he interrupted Ye Ran. “What exactly made you guys make such a scene? Look at you. All of you have become like this. Those who don’t know better will think that you’re some local hooligans!”

Gao Lin stood beside Professor Zhang and lowered her head slightly. She said very politely, “Professor Zhang, the ticket Ye Ran lost was the ticket to Mr. Dong Hua’s concert.”

A ticket to Mr. Dong Hua’s concert?

Professor Zhang was slightly stunned.

No wonder the usually elegant young ladies had all turned into shrews.

No wonder the classroom was in such a mess.

Seeing that Professor Zhang was no longer as angry as before, Ye Ran recalled how Qiao Nian had stolen her tickets. Pointing at Qiao Nian, she accused, “Professor Zhang, the ticket I lost was found in Qiao Nian’s violin case. She stole my ticket!”

When Professor Zhang heard Ye Ran’s words, he frowned slightly and asked, “What evidence do you have to prove that Qiao Nian stole your tickets?”

Ye Ran looked at Professor Zhang in confusion and said seriously, “All the students in the class know that I have tickets to Mr. Dong Hua’s concert. Yesterday, I placed the tickets to the concert in my score. Qiao Nian was the last to leave the classroom last night. Today, I also found tickets in her violin case. If she didn’t steal my tickets, who else could it be?”

When Professor Zhang heard Ye Ran’s words, he thought there was no concrete evidence although her deduction made sense. He frowned and asked, “Just this? Where’s the evidence?”

Ye Ran was so anxious that her tears were about to fall. “Professor Zhang, she’s holding onto my tickets. Isn’t this evidence?”

Professor Zhang pursed his lips and asked, “Then how are you so sure that the ticket in her hand is the one you lost? Can’t it be hers?”

When Professor Zhang said this, everyone present was stunned.

Although Mr. Donghua’s tickets were very rare, it didn’t mean that there was only one ticket to his concert.

Moreover, Ye Ran’s name wasn’t written on the ticket.

Just because Qiao Nian had a ticket to Mr. Dong Hua’s concert, they couldn’t say that Qiao Nian had stolen Ye Ran’s ticket. It would be too rash to make such a conclusion.

When Ye Ran heard Professor Zhang’s words, she choked. For a moment, she didn’t know how to refute him.

Gao Lin, who had been standing silently beside Professor Zhang, saw that Ye Ran was at a disadvantage. In order to get the tickets to Mr. Dong Hua’s concert from Ye Ran in the future, she said, “Professor Zhang, you might not know this, but Ye Ran’s father knows Mr. Dong Hua. That’s why Mr. Dong Hua gave Ye Ran a ticket to the concert. Moreover, everyone knows that the tickets to Mr. Dong Hua’s concert are especially precious. Ordinary people can’t get them even if they spend money. Moreover, there doesn’t seem to be any musician with the surname Qiao in An City!”

When Ye Ran heard Gao Lin’s words, she immediately nodded in agreement. “Yes, Professor Zhang. My ticket disappeared today, and Qiao Nian got a ticket today. If she had taken out her ticket yesterday, I wouldn’t have said anything, but she only got a ticket after my ticket disappeared. If she didn’t steal my ticket, what could it be?”

Professor Zhang’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face, his expression serious. “Do you agree with what they said?”

Qiao Nian shook her head gently. “I disagree.”
