What had Qiao Nian done to deserve such luck?

Why didn’t Gu Zhou and Lu Zhu belong to her?

Qiao Xin clenched her fists tightly, her heart ready to jump out of her mouth.

This wouldn’t do. She had to expose Qiao Nian!

At this moment, Qiao Nian’s heart was surging with emotions, but her expression was very calm. She stared at Lu Zhu unblinkingly, thinking about what happened five years ago. For some reason, she felt that this man didn’t seem to be the owner of the pendant.

“Second Madam Gu.” Lu Zhu smiled at Qiao Nian. His voice was as soothing as the spring breeze.

Gu Zhou nodded. “Only for now!”

Lu Zhu was slightly taken aback, but the smile on his face did not falter. He looked at Gu Zhou meaningfully.

Qiao Nian looked at Lu Zhu. The more she looked at him, the more she felt that Lu Zhu looked familiar. After some hesitation, she asked, “Have… have we met before?”

Lu Zhu had been polite to Qiao Nian solely because Qiao Nian was Gu Zhou’s wife. However, after Gu Zhou’s words, he found that he didn’t like Qiao Nian either. He said coldly, “I’m sorry, we aren’t acquainted.”

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian with a complicated expression. Qiao Nian had always kept her calm, no matter the situation. This was the first time he had seen panic and disappointment written on her face.

Qiao Xin looked at Qiao Nian, who was staring unblinkingly at Gu Zhou. In her heart, she had already cursed Qiao Nian a hundred times. Her words were dripping with sarcasm as she said, “Sister, you’ve come here from the countryside. I think you must have seen Mr. Lu Zhu in his movies.”

Qiao Xin’s words implied that a country bumpkin like Qiao Nian would never have met Mr. Lu Zhu in person.

Hearing Qiao Xin’s words, Qiao Nian frowned slightly.

Qiao Xin sensed the coldness of Gu Zhou’s gaze and froze for a moment, not knowing what she had said wrong.

But Qiao Xin soon understood.

Qiao Nian was still Gu Zhou’s wife, so Gu Zhou was trying to protect his dignity.

That made sense. She had just said that Qiao Nian had been with someone else.

Qiao Nian realized that she had forgotten herself. She smiled and said nothing more.

“Mr. Lu Zhu, is this the pendant you lost?” Changing the subject, Qiao Xin showed Lu Zhu the pendant.

Lu Zhu extended his hand towards Qiao Xin.

Qiao Xin walked over to Lu Zhu in a fawning manner and placed the pendant in his palm.

The drawing room grew eerily quiet.

The silence made both Qiao Nian and Qiao Xin extremely uneasy.

Qiao Xin really didn’t want this pendant to belong to Lu Zhu. She wanted the pendant to belong to that old man in his sixties she had seen previously. That would definitely be nauseating for Qiao Nian.

In any case, her goal was now to become Gu Zhou’s wife. Otherwise, she could settle for being with Lu Zhu instead. She would ask for his contact information in a while.

Qiao Xin no longer held Su Yan in any regard. To her, the Su family was nothing.

Lu Zhu did not have any romantic scandals. His acting skills were outstanding and he had won many Best Actor awards.

Lu Zhu was truly outstanding. Only someone like her, Qiao Xin, would be worthy of him.

Qiao Nian, who was sitting at the side, stared unblinkingly at Lu Zhu. She felt that Lu Zhu was very familiar. Moreover, she was certain that Lu Zhu wasn’t the owner of the pendant.

“Is this pendant yours?” Qiao Xin looked at Lu Zhu uneasily and asked, her voice soft.

Lu Zhu sized up the ring carefully and asked in a casual manner, “Who brought it over?”

Gu Zhou turned to look at Qiao Nian.

Lu Zhu looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief and pursed his lips. Remembering his purpose for coming here, he said, “Do explain. Why do you have my pendant?”

Qiao Nian frowned. She continued to stare unblinkingly at Lu Zhu.

Qiao Xin looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief.

How was this possible?

Five years ago, she had arranged for an old man. It was impossible for him to be Lu Zhu!
