Chapter 1562 Concern

Doctor Ollie had been a doctor for so many years. In his opinion, there was no need to worry too much about a coma if the root cause could be detected. However, a coma that happened for an undetectable reason would be worrisome.

At the thought of this, Doctor Ollie walked out of the ward with a heavy expression.

At this moment, the president had already gotten someone to make arrangements for the precious colorful fungus. He had also gone to visit Lina and Chen Qing. Seeing that Ollie's expression was serious and that Gu Zhou was not around, he asked in a low voice, "How is Miss Qiao now?"

Dr. Ollie frowned. He pursed his lips and shook his head gently. "Miss Qiao's condition isn't good now."

When the president heard this, he felt his breathing hitch. Frowning slightly, he asked, "What do you mean?"

"Miss Qiao has been unconscious. I've checked, but I couldn't find the reason. I…" Ollie paused slightly, his voice a little hoarser. "I'm afraid the situation is critical."

The President pursed his lips tightly and looked at Qiao Nian's ward door with a complicated expression. His eyes were filled with complicated emotions.

Qiao Nian was not related to him, but she was willing to save his family without reservation. She was really a good doctor who cared about her patients.

However, he had selfish motives. He had always been wary of Qiao Nian and was unwilling to believe her.

The president slowly closed his eyes. He was the ruler of a country, so it was normal for him to be careful. However, Qiao Nian was the savior of his family. If he was still so wary of his benefactor, would he still be human?

When the President opened his eyes again, they were filled with heartache. He said to Olly, "You have to save Miss Qiao!"

Initially, he had always treated Qiao Nian as Gu Zhou's wife. He called her "Madam Gu" every time. But now, he had changed. He already treated Qiao Nian as an important person in his heart, which was why he called her "Miss Qiao".

When Doctor Ollie heard Qiao Nian's words, he nodded and said, "I understand."

With that, Ollie stole a glance at the president. He didn't dare to agree directly, afraid that if he couldn't treat Qiao Nian, the president would blame him.

Actually, he was also waiting to see the president's reaction. The president seemed to treat Qiao Nian very well now, as if he was already starting to care about her.

If the president still treated Qiao Nian coldly at this moment, he would feel indignant for Qiao Nian and worry about his future.

Now, it seemed that the president could be touched too. He just had to work hard. His future was bright, and he didn't have to worry about being suspected by the president.

In the ward, after Professor Ollie left, Qiao Nian frowned slightly. She didn't open her eyes.

Actually, when she was talking to the president, she had really fainted. However, she had woken up very quickly, so she told Gu Zhou not to worry about her.

She had heard the conversation between the president and Dr. Ollie outside the ward clearly. It seemed that the president had begun to trust her. What she had done previously had not been in vain.

After a while, Doctor Ollie walked into the ward again and examined Qiao Nian again, but he still didn't find anything wrong.

Qiao Nian had thought that Dr. Ollie would take this opportunity to leave, so she didn't open her eyes. However, Dr. Ollie had been standing by the bed. She could feel him staring at her. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

She wanted to open her eyes and speak to Dr. Ollie, but if Dr. Ollie knew that she had pretended to faint just now, and if the president began to doubt her again, all her efforts would have been in vain.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian held back. She closed her eyes and continued to pretend to faint.

After that, Dr. Ollie put her on an IV.

In a daze, she really fell asleep, because she was indeed not feeling well.

After giving Qiao Nian an injection, Doctor Ollie left. He sighed slightly. He was really worried about Qiao Nian's health. When he came out of the ward, he saw Gu Zhou, who had already taken a shower and changed his clothes, walking over.

When Gu Zhou saw Dr. Ollie, he asked, "How's Nian'er?"

Nian'er?

Doctor Ollie paused for a moment. Only then did he realize that the Nian'er Gu Zhou was referring to was Miss Qiao.

Doctor Ollie told Gu Zhou what he had said to the president. Gu Zhou's frown deepened.
