1346 Not Aggrieved

When Qiao Nian heard Matriarch Gu’s words, she looked at the flowers and plants around her. Her lips curved up slightly as she echoed, “Time passes so quickly. In the blink of an eye, a year has passed.”

Matriarch Gu nodded in agreement and said with emotion, “Since you’re here, Ah Zhou has gradually become more cheerful. Now, I’ve found my great-grandchildren. Too many things have happened in the past year.”

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze slightly. Before she visited the Gu family, she had always been in a mental hospital.

If it weren’t for the fact that Qiao Shan couldn’t bear to let Qiao Xin get married, she wouldn’t have been able to marry into the Gu family, look for her family, and find the children.

Perhaps all of this was fate.

Qiao Nian smiled at Matriarch Gu and said, “Yes, I really didn’t expect us to have three children. I still have to count on Grandma to take care of these children for me.”

“I still want to see them get married and have children with my own eyes.” Matriarch Gu looked up at the sky and said sadly, “But my health is deteriorating day by day. I don’t know when I’ll be seeing Old Master.”

Qiao Nian frowned slightly and said seriously, “Grandma, you’re in good health now. I’ll take good care of you. You’ll definitely live to be a hundred years old.”

Matriarch Gu could tell that Qiao Nian was serious about what she had said. She smiled and said, “Nian Nian, I know you’re a good child. Back then, when I asked you to marry into the Gu family, I didn’t even hold a wedding for you. I was too rash. I really think the Gu family owes you too much. When Ah Zhou returns this time, I’ll definitely get him to give you a grand wedding. I can’t let you suffer anymore.”

“Grandma, I don’t feel aggrieved anymore.” A gentle smile appeared on Qiao Nian’s face. She helped Matriarch Gu to the middle of the pavilion and sat down. She continued, “It was all predestined that I could marry into the Qiao family. Moreover, after I married into the Qiao family, my life was much better than when I was in the Qiao family. I didn’t suffer at all.”

Qiao Nian recalled how she had lived in the Qiao family previously. Her gaze became even gentler. “No matter what happens, Grandma will believe me. You really treat me as your own. I’m very happy to have a Grandma like you. I think I’m already very happy.”

When Matriarch Gu heard Qiao Nian’s words, her eyes couldn’t help but turn red. She said, “Nian Nian, you’re just too easily satisfied. That’s why you’re so happy every day, but Jiang Yue…”

Matriarch Gu pursed her lips slightly and said in a low voice, “Forget it, there’s no need to mention it.”

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze slightly.

Ever since Boss Jin found out about Jiang Yue’s true intentions, he had stripped Jiang Yue naked and handed her over to his subordinates to play with. He had even given Jiang Yue medicine. Jiang Yue was like a female dog wagging her tail and begging for mercy in front of those men.

After the medicine wore off, Jiang Yue looked completely disfigured.

How could Boss Jin let Jiang Yue off so easily? He personally tortured Jiang Yue, and in the end, Jiang Yue went crazy!

Later on, no matter how Boss Jin tortured Jiang Yue, she was indifferent. After all, she was a lunatic and felt nothing.

Boss Jin couldn’t be bothered to torture her any longer. He threw Jiang Yue onto the street.

Although Jiang Yue had already gone crazy, she was good-looking. Many beggars had their eyes on her. It was said that she was basically being violated every moment.

Qiao Nian’s heart didn’t ache for Jiang Yue at all. After all, Jiang Yue was the culprit.

If she had been the one who had failed that day in the villa, Jiang Yue’s outcome would have been hers. She might have been even worse off than Jiang Yue. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

If Grandma knew that Jiang Yue was now in a crazy state, she would probably be sad for her.

Even though Jiang Yue had done many wrong things and Grandma was very disappointed in her, Grandma still had feelings for her.

Qiao Nian didn’t want Grandma to be sad, so she planned to lie to her. She said, “Grandma, I went to MY some time ago and happened to see Jiang Yue. She’s married, and her husband treats her very well…”

“Nian Nian.” Matriarch Gu held Qiao Nian’s hand tightly. A trace of sorrow flashed in her eyes as she said in a low voice, “Actually, I know everything.”
