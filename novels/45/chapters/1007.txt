1008 Zhou Zhou?

A person suddenly changed his eating habits.

Qiao Nian’s expression changed slightly.

Could it be that Gu Zhou’s second personality, Zhou Zhou, had appeared?

She felt that Gu Zhou shouldn’t be drinking cold drinks all the time.

Perhaps Zhou Zhou had come out and he had been drinking cold drinks out of curiosity.

Qiao Nian said calmly to the butler, “I’ll go see him now!”

The butler nodded worriedly.

Qiao Nian’s emotions were complicated. Nothing special seemed to have happened yesterday. Why had Zhou Zhou appeared?

If she pushed the door open and entered, should she call Gu Zhou or Zhou Zhou?

She still remembered Zhou Zhou. He was always dissatisfied with her calling him Gu Zhou.

She should take a look at Gu Zhou’s condition first.

If it was really Zhou Zhou, she might let him sleep first and let Gu Zhou out.

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian returned to her bedroom. Holding the silver needle, she walked towards the study.

Qiao Nian stopped at the study door. She knocked.

“Come in.”

Gu Zhou’s hoarse voice came from the study.

Qiao Nian carefully recalled Gu Zhou’s voice. This voice proved that he wasn’t Zhou Zhou, because Zhou Zhou’s voice carried a trace of childlike innocence.

Qiao Nian had just pushed the door open and walked in when she saw a bottle of drink beside Gu Zhou’s desk.

This was a cold drink.

Gu Zhou was looking down at his documents and didn’t notice that it was Qiao Nian who had entered.

Qiao Nian glanced at the drink. There was a layer of frost on the inner wall of the drink cup. It seemed that the butler was right.

How odd.

Logically speaking, Gu Zhou shouldn’t drink something cold.

Gu Zhou was usually not in good health. In order to protect his health, he would have room temperature drinks or hot water.

Why would Gu Zhou drink a cold drink?

Qiao Nian sat opposite Gu Zhou, frowning slightly. She called out, “Gu Zhou!”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s voice, he stopped writing. He looked up, the gentleness in his eyes obvious. “Why did you wake up so early this time?”

As Gu Zhou spoke, he stood up and walked over to Qiao Nian. He pulled a chair over and sat down.

Qiao Nian didn’t answer Gu Zhou immediately. Instead, she brought the cup over and looked at Gu Zhou in confusion. “I remember I’ve already instructed you not to drink anything cold.”

Qiao Nian was furious.

She felt that Gu Zhou didn’t care about his own health at all.

Gu Zhou could tell that Qiao Nian was angry. His eyes were filled with smiles as he nodded and said, “I’m indeed not feeling well!”

When Qiao Nian heard this, she couldn’t be bothered to be angry anymore. She hurriedly took Gu Zhou’s hand and took his pulse. “Seriously, why do you have to drink a cold drink? Did your illness flare up when I was sleeping? If it did, why didn’t you wake me up? If the butler hadn’t told me that you didn’t look well, I wouldn’t have known that you weren’t feeling well. Have you almost forgotten that I’m your private doctor?”

Qiao Nian took Gu Zhou’s pulse and she frowned. She looked at Gu Zhou in confusion. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

His pulse was very normal. He didn’t look like she had a relapse.

“Your pulse looks fine. Then tell me, where exactly are you feeling unwell?” Qiao Nian still didn’t dare to let her guard down.

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, his eyes lit up. He reached out and pulled Qiao Nian into his arms.

Qiao Nian hadn’t expected Gu Zhou to do this. Seeing the indifference on his face, she sighed helplessly and said, “I’m being serious with you now. Stop fooling around!”

“I’m not fooling around.” Gu Zhou wrapped his arms around Qiao Nian and gently pressed his forehead against hers. He said gently, “I just want to stay at the Dongjiang villa.”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion. Her gaze inadvertently fell on the cup on the table. She suddenly felt a certain someone’s restless hand and recalled what the butler had said. She instantly reacted.

This man was really…

Qiao Nian wanted to stand up and distance herself from Gu Zhou, but Gu Zhou was hugging her so tightly that she couldn’t get up at all.

“Gu Zhou, stop fooling around,” Qiao Nian said helplessly. Seeing that Gu Zhou was still unwilling to give up, she glared at him. “I’m going to have breakfast. I have to go to the Lu family later!”
