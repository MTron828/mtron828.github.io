Chapter 247: Little White Flower

Suddenly, Xia Xue’s eyes lit up. She said hesitantly, “He just left me his phone number. He said that he would contact me when I was free. Do you think I should call him now? I wonder if I can salvage this opportunity?” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Of course you have to call him. Sister Xia Xue, no matter what, you have to give it a try. This concerns your future. Hurry up and call him!” Gao Lin said excitedly, as if Brother Cao was looking for her.

Xia Xue had just called when Brother Cao picked up.

Xia Xue took a deep breath. Her expression was calm, and she returned to her usual dignified and elegant self. “Hello.”

“Miss Xia.”

“It’s me. I just postponed an appointment. Are you still in the training room? Can I go over now?”

“This is great. When can you come over?”

“What do you think of half an hour?” Xia Xue asked carefully.

“Sure, sure. I’ll wait for you here.”

“Alright.”

After saying that, Xia Xue hung up and heaved a sigh of relief. As long as Brother Cao was willing to wait for her in the practice room, it meant that she still had a chance.

When Xia Xue was on the phone just now, Gao Lin had been listening from the side. Now, she said to Xia Xue excitedly, “Senior Xia, from Brother Cao’s words just now, I think he’s already taken a liking to you. I think you’ll become his artist very soon. I heard that Brother Cao only brings one artist with him. Then, if Brother Cao is guiding you, does that mean that you usually practice with Mr. Dong Hua? Oh my god, I’m so excited just thinking about it.”

Gao Lin had a good idea. As long as Xia Xue could become Brother Cao’s artiste, she would definitely have a ticket to Mr. Dong Hua’s concert.

When that happened, she would definitely use the concert tickets to show off in front of Qiao Nian and Wang Xuan, lest they looked down on her.

Xia Xue was still in a daze. She felt as if happiness had suddenly struck her. She looked up and said to Gao Lin, “I think I should go back to the dormitory to change into something prettier. After all, first impressions are especially important.”

Gao Lin nodded vigorously and agreed. “That’s right. We do have to change you into something better-looking. I’ll go with you!”

Twenty minutes later, after Xia Xue was done packing, she and Gao Lin arrived at the door of the training room.

Xia Xue was nervous.

Brother Cao had been waiting at the door. When he saw Xia Xue coming over, he heaved a sigh of relief. Just as he was about to speak, he realized that Xia Xue had changed her clothes.

She was also wearing a white dress with straps. Her long hair fell down, making her look like a beautiful porcelain doll. She was so beautiful that one could not take their eyes off her.

Brother Cao was slightly stunned. Xia Xue had even put on makeup. Did Xia Xue already know?

Brother Cao walked over and smiled. “Miss Xia, you’re finally here. Come in!”

Second Master Lu had been waiting for a long time. If he waited any longer, Second Master might get angry.

When Xia Xue heard Brother Cao’s words, she smiled and asked, “Sir, do you want me to teach your child?”

This was what Xia Xue and Gao Lin had thought of beforehand and pretended not to know Brother Cao’s identity. This way, they could gain a good impression of him.

When Brother Cao heard Xia Xue’s words, he looked at her meaningfully. When Xia Xue had dressed up to attend the banquet, he had thought that Xia Xue already knew his identity.

Many people knew his identity. If Xia Xue hadn’t changed her clothes, he would have believed this excuse. But now, he found this little white flower really annoying.

He wondered what Dong Hua was thinking. Why would he be interested in this woman?

The smile on Brother Cao’s face faded a lot. He led Xia Xue inside. “It has something to do with this place. Let’s talk inside!”

Xia Xue was still very nervous. She didn’t notice the change in Brother Cao’s gaze. She only thought that she was about to achieve instant success. She nodded and said, “Okay.”
