Lu Zhu nodded and said, “Okay, I promise you.”

Actually, Lu Zhu was also very worried. If he chased too closely and the other party sensed it, his sister might be in danger again.

Qiao Nian continued, “It doesn’t matter if Second Brother and Third Brother find out about my identity. However, we can’t let anyone else know!”

It was precisely because the road ahead was unknown and might be full of thorns that she had asked the doctors and nurses to keep it a secret and not want the Lu family to know of her existence. This was also a form of protection for the Lu family.

Lu Zhu nodded.

If they knew that Sugar was still alive, they would be very happy, especially Lu Nian. At that time, Lu Nian liked Sugar the most.

After the two of them arrived at the ward, Qiao Nian helped Lu Zhu to the bed and went to the pantry to get some water.

When she returned, she poured a glass of water for Lu Zhu and brought it to him. “Brother, drink some water first!”

Lu Zhu took the cup from Qiao Nian. After drinking some, he placed the cup on the bedside table.

Lu Zhu watched as Qiao Nian busied herself in the ward. His heart warmed instantly. He still felt like he was dreaming.

Sugar was alive now and she was taking care of him.

Lu Zhu’s throat tightened. “Sugar.”

Qiao Nian was slightly taken aback. She turned to look at Lu Zhu, her beautiful fox eyes curved into crescents as she smiled sweetly. “Brother?”

Lu Zhu looked at Qiao Nian dotingly and said softly, “Don’t be busy anymore. Come over to me and sit down to rest for a while.”

His Sugar was so obedient and cute.

Qiao Nian smiled and nodded.

Suddenly, she liked this nickname her brother called her. When Lu Zhu called her name, she was indescribably happy.

Qiao Nian moved a small stool and sat by Lu Zhu’s bed. She said softly, “Brother, you have to rest well now. It’s getting late. You should rest!”

Lu Zhu looked at Qiao Nian with a smile in his eyes. He said softly, “I’m not sleepy yet.”

Actually, Lu Zhu was already starting to feel sleepy, but he did not dare to sleep. He was worried that he would fall asleep.

If he opened his eyes again, and found out that this was all just a dream and Sugar was gone again…

He didn’t think he could handle the shock.

Lu Zhu stared at Qiao Nian intently. He had never been the kind of person to worry about personal gains and losses. But today, he was really afraid of losing Sugar again.

There was a lot he wanted to say to Sugar, but he didn’t know where to start.

This sister of his must have suffered a lot outside.

But he could not bring his sister home immediately.

Sigh.

Lu Zhu sighed silently in his heart.

Actually, Qiao Nian and Lu Zhu felt the same way.

Although she knew about her relationship with Lu Zhu three days ago, for the past few days, she had been looking forward to Lu Zhu getting better so that she could reunite with him.

After today’s reunion, she could feel her soul trembling with excitement. She couldn’t help but start to worry that all of this was just a dream. When she woke up, she would be the little girl no one wanted again.

Lu Zhu stared at Qiao Nian’s face. Unknowingly, he recalled the way Qiao Yu had looked at Qiao Nian previously. It was a gaze that only men would have when they were facing a woman.

Lu Zhu narrowed his eyes and frowned. He asked bluntly, “Did Qiao Yu bully you?”

Qiao Nian naturally understood what Lu Zhu was saying. She shook her head gently and said, “He didn’t!”

“There’s something wrong with the way he looks at you. It’s as if he has feelings for you beyond being brother and sister,” Lu Zhu said directly.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips, then nodded and briefly recounted the past.

When she was about six, she went up into the mountains with her grandfather to pick herbs. He was worried that she would be in danger, so he told her to stay where she was and wait.

At that time, she had inadvertently noticed a fig tree on the edge of the cliff.

She had heard from her grandfather before that figs were rare in the world and were especially precious herbs.

With that thought, she wanted to pluck the fig and give it to her grandfather.

At that time, she was only thinking about the figs. She reached out to pick one and accidentally fell.
