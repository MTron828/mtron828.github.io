949 Ask Me Directly!

Gu Zhou strode in, his expression dark. His voice was like that of a demon from hell as he said, “If there’s something, ask me directly!”

Qiao Xin was so frightened that her face turned pale. Her heart was about to jump out of her mouth. She had even forgotten to breathe.

Qiao Shan hurriedly stood up and straightened his clothes. He looked at Gu Zhou respectfully and said, “Master Gu, welcome. I…” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Get lost!” Gu Zhou had no patience with Qiao Shan at all. He couldn’t even be bothered to give Qiao Shan a glance. He suppressed his anger.

!!

That cold and murderous aura assaulted Qiao Shan’s face. His heart instantly jumped to his throat, and a chill ran down his spine.

Qiao Shan had heard of Gu Zhou’s ruthless methods in the past. Seeing the current Gu Zhou, he roughly understood that Gu Zhou had a murderous aura.

He was very afraid.

But if he left, Qiao Xin would be the only one facing Gu Zhou’s murderous aura.

After a shudder, Qiao Shan felt that he couldn’t leave Qiao Xin alone. He mustered his courage and said sincerely, “Master Gu, Qiao Xin is still a child. She really knows her mistake. Our family is also thinking of making it up to Qiao Nian. No matter what, I’m still her father!”

Gu Zhou’s expression instantly turned cold. Without hesitation, he kicked Qiao Shan in the stomach.

Qiao Shan staggered two steps back in pain. He clutched his stomach, cold sweat breaking out on his forehead. His face was pale, and he was in so much pain that he couldn’t speak.

“Are you worthy?” Gu Zhou gave Qiao Shan a cold look, then his gaze fell on Qiao Xin, who was not far away.

“Dad!” Qiao Xin cried out in shock. She hurriedly got down with her walking stick and walked towards Qiao Shan.

Chen Qing walked up to Qiao Xin coldly and tripped her over.

Qiao Xin fell to the ground, crying out in pain.

Qiao Shan looked at Qiao Xin worriedly. He wanted to go over and help Qiao Xin up, but Chen Qing kicked him to the ground, causing him to fall to his knees.

The pain in Qiao Shan’s stomach lessened a lot. He had never been humiliated like this before. He looked at Chen Qing behind him angrily. “Let go of me!”

His eyes were red with anger. If looks could kill, Chen Qing would have died a million times over.

“Dad!” Qiao Xin knelt on the ground and looked at Qiao Shan worriedly.

In Qiao Xin’s impression, Qiao Shan would always be a tall and imposing father.

This was the first time Qiao Xin had seen her father in such a sorry state. Her body trembled uncontrollably, and fear gradually welled up in her heart.

She was in trouble!

Not only that, but her father had suffered greatly because of her.

“Second Young Master, please let my father off. My father doesn’t know anything. It’s all my fault. Please let him off!” Qiao Xin looked at Gu Zhou with tears streaming down her face, begging for his forgiveness.

Gu Zhou stood there coldly, unmoved.

Seeing his daughter begging for mercy for him, Qiao Shan’s heart instantly softened. He hurriedly said, “Qiao Xin, don’t move. Your leg is still injured!”

At the thought that he had found out about Second Young Madam’s past and recalled the despicable things the Qiao family had done, Chen Qing’s expression instantly darkened.

Their family cared about each other, but they only knew how to bully Second Young Madam.

With this thought in mind, Chen Qing dislocated Qiao Shan’s arm. With a crack, Qiao Shan’s right arm was dislocated.

Qiao Shan’s face contorted in pain. He frowned, not daring to make a sound. He was worried that Qiao Xin would be concerned about him.

“Dad!” Qiao Xin looked at Qiao Shan with heartache and her tears fell uncontrollably. She struggled to crawl up to Qiao Shan. However, she had pulled on the wound on her leg and it hurt so much that she cried out in pain.

Seeing this, Qiao Shan looked at Qiao Xin with heartache. Suppressing the pain, he comforted her. “Don’t move. I-I’m fine!”

Seeing that Qiao Shan was speaking, Chen Qing pinched his collarbone hard, forcing him to kneel on the spot obediently.

Qiao Xin hated herself for hurting her leg. She looked at Gu Zhou with red-rimmed eyes and said furiously, “Gu Zhou, come at me if you’re angry. I’ll take responsibility for my own actions. Don’t implicate my father!”

“Is that so?” Gu Zhou pulled a chair over and sat down elegantly. He crossed his right leg over the seat and raised his eyebrows slightly.
