Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

At this moment, footsteps came from the corridor.

Qiao Nian turned around and saw Gu Zhou walking in. She met Gu Zhou’s intriguing gaze.

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s arm, which was still bleeding.

At this moment, the butler walked over. Gu Zhou said coldly, “Lock it in the cage.”

The snake seemed to realize that it had done something wrong. It sat there aggrievedly, unmoving. It allowed Butler Zhao to lock it up.

Qiao Nian frowned.

The girl, who had been too shocked, seemed to have only just come back to her senses. Weeping pitifully, she said in a weak voice, “Brother Gu Zhou, I’m so scared.”

With that, the girl prepared to throw herself into Gu Zhou’s arms.

Gu Zhou frowned. Under his suffocatingly cold gaze, the girl stood rooted to the ground in fear.

“Brother Gu Zhou…”

Gu Zhou’s expression was abnormally dark. His eyes were ice-cold as he asked impatiently, “Who are you? Why are you in my study?”

The young girl looked at Gu Zhou in shock. She raised her hand to wipe her tears and said pitifully, “Brother Gu Zhou, I’m Wang Miao, Wang Lin’s biological sister. We met at the hospital back then!”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned.

‘Wang Lin.

This name sounded familiar. She seemed to have heard it before.

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Wang Miao’s face. Suddenly, the realization struck her. She remembered now. Wasn’t Wang Lin a woman Su Xue had casually made up in order to help Qiao Xin get out of the situation?

Did Wang Lin actually exist?

Why would Gu Zhou ask Wang Lin’s younger sister to come to the Gu residence?

Qiao Nian stood rooted to the ground, studying Wang Miao intently. Could it be that Gu Zhou had taken a liking to Wang Miao? Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

‘The next moment, Gu Zhou’s words made Qiao Nian overturn her own thoughts.

“Who allowed you to enter my study?” Gu Zhou’s expression was extremely dark. His entire body emitted a cold aura, causing one to shiver in fear.

‘Wang Miao froze. She had not expected Gu Zhou to hate her, not when she was the aunt of Gu Zhou’s child. “I…”

“Get out! Without my permission, anyone who steps into the study will have to report to the king of the underworld!” Although Gu Zhou’s voice wasn’t loud, it was frightening.

‘Wang Miao was so frightened that she no longer dared to cry. She took two steps back, then hurried out.

‘When Wang Miao walked to the study door, she seemed to remember something. She turned back to look at Gu Zhou and said softly, “Thank you, Brother Gu Zhou, for saving me. Otherwise, I might have been bitten to death by that snake!”

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but think: Was this person mentally deficient?

Gu Zhou’s expression darkened further. He glanced at Qiao Nian, then at Wang Miao. “You should be thanking her. What has that got to do with me? There’s no place for anyone with bad eyesight in the Gu family.”

‘Wang Miao froze. She didn’t expect Gu Zhou to be so ruthless when speaking with her. She looked at Qiao Nian with teary eyes.

‘That woman was naturally beautiful and gave off a noble and elegant aura. Even though her arm was injured, her composure was completely unaffected.

‘Wang Miao felt ashamed of herself. Compared to that woman, she was like a stray dog one found on the streets.

‘Wang Miao lowered her head and said reluctantly, “Thank you.”

With that, Wang Miao walked out, wiping her tears.

‘Wang Miao had thought that Brother Gu Zhou would take good care of her on account of her older sister. After all, she was Little Qi’s aunt, and she was a relative of the Gu family.

How could Brother Gu Zhou treat her like this?

Her sister had lost her life because of him.

The more Wang Miao thought about it, the more awful she felt. She couldn’t help but burst into tears..
