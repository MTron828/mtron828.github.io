1384 Grab the Child

Usually, Song Yu was always generous and proper. Even when Song Yu secretly gave her a reminder last time, Song Yu still maintained her elegance and composure.

Now, Song Yu was in a sorry state. Qiao Nian also noticed that when Song Yu ran over, her eyeliner was smudged. She might have cried.

“Sister Song Yu, I’m fine. Don’t cry,” Lu Qi said obediently.

Song Yu pursed her lips tightly and tried not to cry. She hugged Lu Qi tightly and tried hard to calm herself down. She took a deep breath, let go of Lu Qi, and sat on the other side of her. “When I finished filming at noon, I realized that something had happened at the Wang Village Tunnel. I also saw in the group chat that Big Brother and Second Brother were going to save you. I was frightened.”

“Sister Song Yu, I’m fine. It’s all thanks to Senior Brother for saving me.” As Lu Qi spoke, she glanced at the operating theater, her eyes dim. “Senior Brother is seriously injured. I wonder how he’s doing.”

Song Yu followed Lu Qi’s gaze and said softly, “He’ll definitely be safe. Don’t worry, how are you? Are you feeling unwell?”

“I’m really fine. I was just frightened. I had some nutrition shots. Nothing else.” Lu Qi forced a smile.

Song Yu heaved a sigh of relief and tucked her hair behind her ear. She tried hard to remain calm and nodded. “That’s good.”

“Song Yu,” Qiao Nian called out. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Song Yu looked over. When she saw Qiao Nian, she called out shyly, “Sister.”

“I have something to ask you.” Qiao Nian smiled at Song Yu, her voice as gentle as ever.

Song Yu looked at Qiao Nian in confusion, but still nodded.

Lu Qi’s expression changed slightly. Could it be that her sister was still suspecting Sister Song Yu?

Sister Song Yu cared so much about her. How could she harm her?

Lu Nian frowned imperceptibly, but it quickly relaxed.

“What did you mean when we were eating together?” Qiao Nian pretended to be puzzled.

Lu Qi was stunned. Her sister and Sister Song Yu had actually eaten together. Why hadn’t they brought her along?

When Song Yu heard Qiao Nian’s words, she glanced around in a panic. Seeing that other than the Lu family, there was only Gu Zhou and Chen Qing, she heaved a sigh of relief. “Sister, I heard someone calling at home that evening.”

Song Yu’s words instantly made Lu Zhu and Lu Nian wary.

Song Yu recalled what had happened that day and said uncertainly, “Sister, the person who called should be from the Lu family, but he didn’t speak when he called. The voice on his phone was changed. He seemed to be saying something like ‘grab the child’. At that time, I was looking for my earring in the grass in the garden. That person was standing by the grass where I was.”

“Grab the child?”

Song Yu nodded, her face slightly pale, as if she had been frightened. “At that time, I was wondering if there was a child at home. Later on, I remembered that Sister had a child. I wasn’t sure if that person was talking about Sister’s child. I thought that it was better to be safe.”

When Lu Qi heard Song Yu’s words, she held her hand tightly and asked in surprise, “Sister Song Yu, why didn’t you tell me about this back then?”

“It’s useless to tell you. I wanted to go over and take a closer look, but I thought of what happened in Jiang Cheng and didn’t dare to go out. I originally planned to call Sister immediately.” At this point, Song Yu sighed slightly.

“Ever since I came out of the grass, I keep feeling as if there’s a pair of eyes staring at me. I’m also afraid that my cell phone will be monitored. Usually, when I’m filming, I hand my cell phone to my assistant. The chances of the cell phone being tampered with are very high. I want to tell my brothers about this, but they’re not at home either.”

Song Yu blinked and said nervously, “Sister, I’m not sure I heard you clearly, but the next morning, I kept feeling that someone was following me, so I treated you to a meal and wanted to tell you secretly.”

“Where’s your phone?” Qiao Nian asked.

“My phone is with my assistant.” Song Yu quickly understood what Qiao Nian meant. She asked, “Why don’t I look for my assistant now and ask him to give me my phone?”

“There’s no need.” Qiao Nian smiled and said, “I’m worried that there’s eavesdropping software installed in your phone. Since the cell phone isn’t in your hands, you don’t have to worry.”
