Chapter 343: Extremely Insulting

Gu Qi shook his head gently. “I don’t know.”

Qiao Nian frowned slightly. She didn’t know what kind of family Gu Qi lived in. She looked at Gu Qi worriedly.

“When I was very young, Mommy wasn’t by my side. Back then, Dad told me that Mommy had gone to another world and would never return.”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Qi with heartache.

After his mother passed away, his father no longer loved him. No wonder Gu Qi did not like to speak in school.

Gu Qi looked up at Qiao Nian, his eyes shining with a strange light. He said happily, “A few days ago, I heard Dad and Uncle talking. They said that they seemed to have made a mistake. My mommy might still be alive, so the mommy living in the funeral home isn’t my mommy. I think Mommy is still waiting for me to find her!”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Qi in surprise. How could such a thing be wrong?

Qiao Nian asked, “Then how do you plan to find your mommy?”

When Gu Qi heard Qiao Nian’s words, he shook his head. “I don’t know…”

“How about this? Tell me what characteristics your mommy has. Auntie can help you find her!” Qiao Nian said.

Gu Qi shook his head again.

Seeing this, Qiao Nian couldn’t help but frown. This was really difficult. There was no information at all. How could she find anyone?

Gu Qi looked at Qiao Nian and asked in confusion, “Auntie, I couldn’t find Mommy, but why do you look unhappy?”

Qiao Nian smiled and said, “Auntie is also looking for her mommy.”

When Gu Qi heard Qiao Nian’s words, he was slightly stunned. “Auntie, have you seen your mommy?”

“I’m the same as you. I didn’t grow up by Mommy’s side.”

When Gu Qi heard Qiao Nian’s words, his frown deepened. He said worriedly, “Auntie, you shouldn’t be young anymore, right?”

Qiao Nian was stunned. Where were his manners?

Gu Qi sighed and said like an adult, “You’ve been searching for so many years, but you still haven’t found her. Doesn’t that mean I’ll have to search for her for as long as you?”

Qiao Nian was speechless.

Qiao Nian explained patiently, “Auntie only found out about my mommy a few days ago. There’s someone else!”

Gu Qi heaved a sigh of relief and said, “Fortunately, I found out early!”

Qiao Nian thought, “It really didn’t hurt much but it was extremely insulting.”

Gu Qi looked at Qiao Nian seriously and asked, “Auntie, don’t worry. I’ll help you find your Mommy. Is there anything special about Auntie’s mommy?” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Nian shook her head gently. “No!”

Gu Qi rested his chin on his hands like a little hamster, deep in thought.

Qiao Nian was also at a loss. She searched for a while, but found nothing.

“Wow, what a cute child!”

Suddenly, a gentle voice came from the side.

Qiao Nian turned her head and saw two well-dressed noblewomen standing at the side.

They were here for dessert and happened to see the adorable Gu Qi.

“Oh, little girl, you’re so lucky to have such a good-looking and cute son!”

“How old is your son?”

“The two of you look exactly alike!”

“Can I hug your child?”

As she spoke, one of the noblewomen began to move.

Gu Qi moved back warily, avoiding Madam’s hand. His expression was cold.

The woman’s hand froze in midair.

Gu Qi exuded an aura that kept people away. He was extremely cold.

The woman retracted her hand guiltily. “I’m sorry, I’m really sorry. I just like children!”

Qiao Nian could naturally tell that she really liked children. She smiled and said, “I’m really sorry. He doesn’t like to be touched by strangers. Also, he’s not my son. He doesn’t like to talk much either.”

When the woman heard Qiao Nian’s words, she said apologetically, “I see. I’m really sorry. I was too rash.”

After that, the two of them sat down at a table.

The waiter brought the dessert over.
