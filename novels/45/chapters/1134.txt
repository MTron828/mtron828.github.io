1135 Temptation

Qin Chuan felt that he was on the verge of being angered to death. He tried hard to remain calm. Suddenly, his eyes lit up and he asked with interest, “Then do you want to acknowledge Old Master Qin as your master?”

Old Master Qin?

Could she be Old Master Qin’s disciple?

Was Old Master Qin still taking in disciples?

Lu Qi’s mind was in a mess. She realized that Qin Chuan was Old Master Qin’s biological grandson. Had Old Master Qin said that he wanted to take in a disciple?

Happiness came too suddenly. Lu Qi was a little uncertain. Was Old Master Qin her sister’s master?

“Is Old Master Qin my sister’s master?” Lu Qi’s eyes were sparkling as he stared fixedly at Qin Chuan.

“Of course!” With one hand in his pocket, Qin Chuan nodded.

Lu Qi covered her mouth in excitement and almost jumped up.

She wanted to study medicine, so she had already searched a lot of information about the medical field before she entered university.

Old Master Qin was a world-renowned doctor. With acupuncture needles, he could pull a dead person back from the gates of hell. He was the number one Chinese doctor in Country Z.

Previously, she had heard from her sister that Old Master Qin had disappeared.

If she could become Old Master Qin’s disciple, she would be able to learn more Chinese medicine. Her voice trembled as she asked, “Then… then did you and Sister find Old Master Qin?”

“Although we haven’t found Old Master Qin, we already know his whereabouts,” Qin Chuan said seriously.

“Then should I wait for him to be found before acknowledging him as my master?” Lu Qi lowered her head in disappointment. She did not know when they would be able to find Old Master Qin. She really wanted to learn medicine from Old Master Qin as soon as possible!

“Actually, you’re already my grandfather’s disciple!”

“What?” Lu Qi tilted her head and looked at Qin Chuan in confusion. She blinked in confusion. “But I haven’t acknowledged Old Master Qin as my master!”

“Do you remember the ten questions on the post?”

“I remember. It took me several years to solve that set of questions!” Lu Qi nodded obediently!

“You might not know this, but those questions were set by my grandfather.” Qin Chuan looked at Lu Qi’s sparkling eyes and was slightly dazed, but he quickly came back to his senses. “He once said that if someone could solve these ten questions, he would accept that person as his disciple. In other words, you’re already my grandfather’s disciple!”

Lu Qi was so shocked that her mouth was wide open. After a long while, she sighed. “I… I’ve already become Old Master Qin’s disciple?”

Lu Qi felt as if something had fallen into her lap. She was dizzy.

Qin Chuan’s eyes darkened. He looked at Lu Qi with a burning gaze and nodded. “Now that we’re already fellow disciples, I still think it’s a little inappropriate for you to call me Uncle!”

“Senior Brother!” Lu Qi immediately corrected herself and called out sweetly.

When Qin Chuan heard Lu Qi’s words, the corners of his mouth curved up slightly, and his eyes were filled with smiles. He couldn’t help but reach out and rub Lu Qi’s head. He said gently, “If you have time in the future, I’ll take you home to visit the ancestors of our bloodline!”

Lu Qi sensed Qin Chuan’s worry-free warmth. That warmth spread from her head to every part of her body. Even her heart was beating faster and faster!

How strange!

Why was her heart racing?

Could there be something wrong with her heart?

However, Lu Qi quickly understood. She was probably too happy, so her heart was beating fast!

“Okay!” Lu Qi nodded seriously and said with a sweet smile, “Senior Brother, it’s getting late. I’ll go home first!”

Lu Qi waved at Qin Chuan, turned around, and ran home.

Qin Chuan stood rooted to the ground and watched as Lu Qi left. He narrowed his eyes slightly. He thought that his grandfather would definitely like Lu Qi. In any case, he had already helped his grandfather take in this little disciple in advance. His grandfather no longer had the right to refuse!

Moreover, he really didn’t like being called Uncle Qin!

Qin Chuan waited for Lu Qi to enter the house before driving away! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience
