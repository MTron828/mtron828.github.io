Who could have done such a thing? Using their powers to fake a paternity test?

All of this could only be investigated slowly after she returned to An City. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

If the incident had been staged, there would be some trace evidence left.

Lu Zhu sat there, looking at Qiao Nian’s thoughtful expression. Puzzled, he asked, “Why did you suddenly ask about my sister?”

Hearing Lu Zhu’s question, Qiao Nian’s heart was in her throat.

If she told Lu Zhu the truth, his body might not be able to withstand it and his life would be threatened.

Although Qiao Nian really wanted to reunite with Lu Zhu as soon as possible, she didn’t want to hurt him.

However, Qiao Nian wanted to use the principle of boiling a frog with warm water to slowly reveal to Lu Zhu about the truth of the eldest daughter of the Lu family. With a sincere expression, she said, “Don’t you want to know about your sister’s current condition? I’ll tell you when your condition stabilizes.”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Lu Zhu frowned. He stared at Qiao Nian without blinking, a hint of surprise in his eyes.

Could it be that Qiao Nian was already planning to give him the Moon Goddess?

At the thought of this, Lu Zhu’s heart could not help but tremble. Then, in the next moment, his wound was pulled and he almost could not breathe from the pain.

Lu Zhu subconsciously wanted to cover his chest with his hand. Just as he placed his hand on his chest, pain instantly assaulted him. He almost fainted from the pain.

Lu Zhu’s breathing was heavy.

Seeing Lu Zhu like this, Qiao Nian hurriedly walked forward and gently stroked his back. She comforted him, saying, “Don’t be agitated. Slowly, breathe. Breathe gently. Don’t be anxious. That’s right, that’s it…”

After Qiao Nian’s comfort, Lu Zhu’s breathing gradually became smoother. His wildly beating heart gradually calmed down, and the pain instantly lessened.

Bang!

There was a sudden crash as the ward door was kicked open with force.

A sharp female voice answered instantly.

“What are you two doing?!”

When Qiao Nian heard the sound, she turned around and saw Song Yue in a wheelchair, looking at her with resentment.

Seeing how calm Qiao Nian and Lu Zhu were, Song Yue was slightly taken aback. From Qiao Nian’s voice just now, she had thought that Qiao Nian had eaten Lu Zhu.

Song Yue took a deep breath. It seemed that she had misunderstood the two of them.

But so what?

Qiao Nian, this shameless b*tch, was almost pressed against Lu Zhu.

The more Song Yue thought about it, the angrier she became. She scolded angrily, “Qiao Nian, do you still have any sense of shame? Before, you and Gu Zhou were very intimate. Now, you’re pestering Lu Zhu. Do you really think that the world revolves around you? Do you think all men should like you?”

Qiao Nian didn’t seem to hear Song Yue’s words. She carefully covered Lu Zhu with the blanket and looked at Song Yue coldly.

If not for Song Yue’s appearance, her time alone with her brother would not have been interrupted.

After Qiao Nian was done, her gaze landed on Song Yue’s face. She walked up to Song Yue and looked down at her. “Are you teaching me a lesson?”

Song Yue looked up at Qiao Nian. When she met Qiao Nian’s cold eyes, her body trembled involuntarily.

Standing behind Song Yue, Xu Qian was also shocked by Qiao Nian’s aura.

Xu Qian took a step back silently and swallowed nervously. If she had known earlier, she wouldn’t have brought Song Yue over.

Song Yue was really too troublesome. Not only did she not cooperate with her treatment, but she also cried and insisted on coming to see Lu Zhu.

Xu Qian was also getting impatient. Thinking that Song Yue was only concerned about Lu Zhu, she agreed.

However, she never expected that as soon as she reached the door of the ward, Song Yue was triggered like a cat.
