Chapter 309: Reversal

“A woman who can use her beauty to become a mistress. I think she’ll definitely do something to slander others!”

“I don’t think that’s possible. I’ve heard Qiao Nian play the violin. Her music is very riveting and spiritual. I think she must be very kind-hearted to be able to master the violin to such an extent. She must be a very good lady! I think the rumors on Tieba are all slander!”

…

Amidst everyone’s discussion, Qiao Nian walked towards Gao Lin with her violin on her back.

Everyone’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian stood in front of Gao Lin, her fox-like eyes emitting a cold light. She glanced at the guilty Xia Xue and the uneasy Liu Yu and raised her eyebrows slightly. “I’ll give you one last chance. Apologize in person, or ruin your reputation. Choose!”

If Qiao Nian were a kept woman, it would be easier to believe.

Xia Xue bit her lip hard and cried pitifully. She questioned pitifully, “Qiao Nian, things have already come to this. Aren’t you going to apologize to us? What exactly do you want? Do you want to use me as a stepping stone?”

Gao Lin and Liu Yu, who were standing beside Xia Xue, nodded in agreement.

Qiao Nian’s red lips curved up in a mocking smile. “I’ve already given you a chance. Since you don’t want it, let’s take this to Weibo!”

After Qiao Nian finished speaking, she looked down at the post she had already composed on Weibo. Finally, she clicked “Send”.

Qiao Nian posted the recording and it instantly went viral on Weibo.

# Shocking. Xia Xue is pretending to be Mr. Dong Hua’s female musician and impersonating someone #

# Qiao Nian the Treasure Girl

Curious, everyone on the field took out their phones and began to follow the trending searches on Weibo.

In less than two minutes, Qiao Nian was the trending topic that topped the searches.

At this moment, everyone in the school was shocked.

The second trending topic was Second Young Master Gu’s Weibo.

“It’s my honor to build a gymnasium for An City University!”

After that, Gu Zhou tagged Qiao Nian, the principal of An City University.

Everyone looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief. They had never expected Qiao Nian to be the principal of An City University.

How did she become the principal at such a young age?

Oh, right.

There was an unwritten rule in An City University. The principal of An City University was hereditary. As long as the younger generation was outstanding, they could take on this heavy responsibility.

No one had expected Qiao Nian to be the principal of An City University.

Moreover, those ambiguous photos on the forum were deliberately photoshopped by someone with ulterior motives.

The truth was always so unexpected.

When Gao Lin saw Weibo, she was stunned. It was as if she had been struck by lightning. She could no longer think.

Xia Xue and Liu Yu were also dumbfounded.

The netizens on Weibo instantly erupted.

[Oh my god, the principal is so young and beautiful. She can even debut in the C-rank in the entertainment industry!]

[She’s the first person in the world to make Gu Zhou publish a post!]

[I know her. There have been many rumors about her in school these past few days. They say that she’s a kept woman of a rich man. Those who spread rumors are truly despicable!]

[So she was discussing a collaboration with Gu Zhou. How despicable is the person who took those photos? They said that she was an old man’s sugar baby. Rumors are simply terrifying!]

[If she debuts, I want to be her first fan!]

…

Qiao Nian’s Weibo account instantly gained countless fans.

While everyone was still worshiping Qiao Nian, Mr. Dong Hua made a post.

“Welcome, my female musician!”

After that, Mr. Donghua even tagged Qiao Nian!

Netizens were confused.

By the time the netizens came back to their senses, Weibo had already exploded. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com
