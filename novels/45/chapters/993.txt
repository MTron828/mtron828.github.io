994 Doubts

At that time, Gu Zhou had his doubts, but Wang Lin had bled to death, so Gu Zhou did not dare to investigate at all.

A woman had used all her strength to give birth, but he still wanted to investigate if she was the mother of the child. This was the greatest humiliation to a woman who had died in childbirth.

Gu Zhou said, “At that time, my thoughts were all on Xiao Qi, and I didn’t want to think back to when Xiao Qi was born. No matter what, I should treat her family well.”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief and said, “If it were me, I wouldn’t hesitate to believe that woman is the mother of the child.”

!!

However, on second thought, if Gu Zhou had given up on looking for Gu Qi’s biological mother long ago, she might have missed Gu Zhou again.

“I’ve always felt that she should have a pendant, so I’ve been investigating what happened back then. I wanted to get to the bottom of it.” Gu Zhou frowned.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou’s expression and suddenly recalled Lu Zhu’s words. All these years, Gu Zhou had also been protecting the woman from that night.

If Gu Zhou didn’t care about that girl’s reputation, he might have searched everywhere for the whereabouts of the pendant.

It was precisely because of Gu Zhou’s carefulness that people like Su Xue and Qiao Xin had an opportunity.

At that time, Qiao Xin was lying. She even said that Wang Lin had given the pendant to Qiao Xin.

At that time, Qiao Nian didn’t understand why Gu Zhou had fallen ill again. Gu Zhou probably subconsciously didn’t want to believe such a cruel thing. He still hoped that the child’s mother was still alive.

Qiao Xin’s words were like the last straw that broke the camel’s back. Gu Zhou’s faith collapsed, and that was why he fell ill.

No one could remain calm when their faith collapsed.

Gu Zhou lowered his head. When he found out that the pendant was really with Wang Lin, he really couldn’t accept this.

However, not long after, Wang Miao’s appearance made Gu Zhou suspicious again.

The two sisters had grown up in the same environment. There should be some similarities.

At that time, Wang Miao was selfish and did not have any upbringing.

Gu Zhou also began to suspect that Wang Lin wasn’t the girl from that night.

Although he felt that he had let the dead Wang Lin down by asking Wang Miao and Gu Qi to do a paternity test, he had already thought it through. If it was really Wang Lin, he would satisfy the Wang family’s request. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

If it weren’t for the Wang family, he wouldn’t have been involved too much with the Wang family.

He felt that there was a 90% chance that Gu Qi was not Wang Lin’s child.

The result was really as he had thought.

Wang Lin was not the child’s biological mother. The huge rock in his heart gradually disappeared, leaving only a small sense of relief.

Lu Qi blinked in confusion. Why didn’t she understand anything? “You make it sound complicated. I won’t wait for you anymore. I want to see the children!”

Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou looked at each other and smiled, not saying anything else.

Lu Qi stood up and walked towards the stairs. She had only taken a few steps when she saw a young lady who was as soft as a blessing doll.

“Daddy, Mommy?” Xiao Shi stood at the stairs and called out sweetly, looking extremely obedient.

When Lu Jiang heard this voice, he seemed to be greatly shocked. He turned his head and his heart instantly softened.

Lu Qi looked at Xiao Shi in a daze. Oh my god, how could there be such an obedient and cute child!

Qiao Nian looked at Xiao Shi, her eyes filled with a doting smile. She waved at Xiao Shi. “Xiao Shi, come over!”

Xiao Shi walked down the stairs. When she passed by Lu Qi, she smiled and jogged over to Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian naturally picked Xiao Shi up and placed her on her lap. She tucked Xiao Shi’s hair behind her ear. “Weren’t you doing your homework just now?”

“Mommy, can I…” Xiao Shi looked up at Qiao Nian and bit her lower lip. She looked hesitant, not knowing if she should say it.

In the past, when she was in Hai Cheng, she worked hard every day to survive. She also wanted to study like her neighbor’s sister, but her family was really too poor.

She heard from the people around her that studying was something boys did. Girls just had to tidy up the house and stay at home obediently.
