1025 Crossing the Brazier

A gentle smile appeared on Song Yu’s face. She grabbed Lu Qi’s hand and nodded seriously. “Yes!”

The smile on Lu Qi’s face grew brighter. Looking at the fireworks, her heart was filled with joy.

The fireworks were still exploding. Matriarch Lu took Qiao Nian’s hand and walked towards the ancestral hall. She smiled and said, “Sugar, we’re going to see our ancestors now. Our ancestors must know in the netherworld and have been blessing you!”

Qiao Nian agreed.

Walking to the entrance of the ancestral hall, the butler stood there with a smile. There was a brazier on the ground.

The butler smiled and said, “Miss, you’ve just returned and stepped over the brazier. Miss will have a prosperous life in the future.”

Matriarch Lu smiled at Qiao Nian and said, “Sugar, don’t be afraid. The fire isn’t big. It won’t hurt you.”

Qiao Nian was very touched. She knew that the small flame in the brazier couldn’t hurt her, but Grandma’s concern warmed her heart.

It was a Chinese tradition to use fire to burn away all the bad luck so that their family could live a more prosperous life.

Qiao Nian lifted her skirt slightly and stepped over the brazier.

Qiao Nian’s simple action was worth more than twenty years of waiting for Matriarch Lu. Her eyes instantly turned red, and she hurriedly applauded hard.

Everyone applauded as well, smiling at Qiao Nian.

Stepping over the brazier, Matriarch Lu led Qiao Nian into the ancestral hall. There were more than ten rows of memorial tablets in the ancestral hall. These memorial tablets were the ancestors of the Lu family.

Matriarch Lu immediately saw a small memorial tablet in the bottom row. She took a step forward and took the memorial tablet down, hugging it in her arms. She bowed to the ancestors and muttered, “Ancestors, I’m really sorry. I made a mistake previously. Our eldest daughter, Lu Nian, is alive and well. She’s fine. Please bless her for her safety!”

The candles in the ancestral hall were brightly lit. Qiao Nian looked around, her gaze finally landing on Matriarch Lu.

Matriarch Lu pulled Qiao Nian to the middle and said to the ancestors at the memorial tablet seriously, “Ancestors, this is our eldest daughter. I hope you can remember her and always bless her!”

With that, Matriarch Lu handed the memorial tablet in her hand to the butler and instructed, “Remember to wrap it in red satin. After the master takes a look, choose a good day and dispose of the memorial tablet made for Sugar in the past!”

“Yes.” With that, the butler swiftly left with the memorial tablet.

Matriarch Lu walked to the incense cabinet at the side and took out three incense sticks. She handed them to Qiao Nian and instructed gently, “Sugar, come and offer incense to the ancestors now. Let them know that you’re back!”

Qiao Nian nodded.

She took the incense and walked to the middle of the ancestral hall. Holding the lit incense in her hand, she bowed seriously with a pious expression.

Then, she inserted the incense into the incense burner, and the smoke rose into the air.

Matriarch Lu looked at the smoke and couldn’t help but smile. It seemed that her ancestors liked Sugar a lot and were willing to protect her.

After Qiao Nian finished offering incense, she stood aside with Matriarch Lu.

Lu Zhu brought his younger siblings to offer incense one by one. When they were done, Qiao Nian saw that Gu Zhou was still standing at the side.

“It’s your turn to offer incense.” Qiao Nian smiled.

Everyone followed Qiao Nian’s gaze and saw her speaking to Gu Zhou.

The ancestral hall of the Lu family was filled with the ancestors of the Lu family. By saying this, Qiao Nian was admitting that she and Gu Zhou were husband and wife.

Gu Zhou didn’t look at the others. Instead, he walked straight to Qiao Nian’s side.

Qiao Nian took out three more incense sticks and handed them to Gu Zhou. Then, she took three incense sticks herself and looked at Gu Zhou gently. “You’ll offer incense with me.”

Matriarch Lu, who was standing beside Qiao Nian,’s expression darkened. Her expression was serious, as if she was very unhappy.

The granddaughter she had been looking forward to returning to was actually married. Just thinking about it made her unhappy.

However, when she saw the gentleness in Qiao Nian’s eyes as she looked at Gu Zhou, she sighed helplessly.

When a woman grew up, she could not be kept.

It seemed that her granddaughter liked Gu Zhou very much.

Matriarch Lu was not someone who would break up her marriage, so she said, “Ah Zhou, since you and Sugar are already married, you’re now the son-in-law of our Lu family. You should indeed offer incense with Sugar.”
