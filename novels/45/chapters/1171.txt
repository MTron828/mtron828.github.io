1172 Hug!

Thank you readers!

Su Yan looked at Shen An’s panicked expression and frowned slightly. She glanced at the USB drive in her hand and looked at Shen An with a complicated expression.

“Mom, I think Dr. Shen’s mental state is really abnormal.” Qiao Nian stared unblinkingly at Shen An. Shen An’s every move didn’t seem to be an act at all.

Qiao Nian walked up to Shen An and reached out to hold his hand. She called out in a low voice, “Dad, what’s wrong? Don’t you know me?”

When Su Yan heard Qiao Nian’s voice, her expression faltered slightly. Seeing Qiao Nian give her a look, she immediately understood that Qiao Nian wanted to take the opportunity to examine Shen An’s body.

“Baby.” When Shen An heard Qiao Nian’s voice, he looked up at her. A bright smile appeared on his face, and his eyes lit up. “Baby, Daddy misses you so much. Hug!”

As Shen An spoke, he hugged Qiao Nian’s body and gently patted her back. He said gently, “Baby, be good. Dad has waited a long time for you.”

Qiao Nian frowned slightly, not understanding what Shen An meant by “Dad has waited a long time for you”. However, she still went along with Shen An’s words. “Baby misses Dad too.”

Qiao Nian coaxed Shen An to let go. She took his hand with both hands and placed her fingers on his pulse without a trace.

“Baby, you’ve grown up. How’s your piano playing?” Shen An looked at Qiao Nian lovingly, his eyes so gentle that water could drip from them.

“Yes, not bad. Is Dad working hard?” Qiao Nian said distractedly, frowning imperceptibly. She looked at Shen An’s face carefully.

His brow was purple, his lips were purple, and his eyes were red-rimmed.

He was indeed poisoned. Perhaps Shen An knew a lot about what had happened back then. In the beginning, Shen An should have only pretended to be crazy. Now that he had been poisoned, his memories were already in a mess.

As Qiao Nian spoke to Shen An, she took out a silver needle. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“It’s not hard, it’s not hard at all. As long as baby is fine, Dad will be satisfied.” Shen An refused to let go of Qiao Nian’s hand, his eyes moist. “Baby, I”

Before Shen An could finish speaking, he fainted. Qiao Nian silently pulled the silver needle out of Shen An’s head and shouted, “Oh no, Medical Examiner Shen has fainted!”

As the light in the room was very dim, Su Yan didn’t see Qiao Nian’s trick at all. Thinking that Shen An had really fainted, she hurriedly walked forward.

Gu Zhou hurriedly pulled open the curtains.

Sunlight filtered in from outside and fell on Shen An’s face. His expression was livid.

“Teacher, what’s wrong? Teacher” Su Yan inadvertently placed her hand under Shen An’s nose. Suddenly, her expression changed, and her voice trembled. “Teacher Teacher is dead?”

Gu Zhou didn’t know what Qiao Nian had done. When he heard that Shen An was dead, he immediately opened the door of the ward.

Soon, the director and nurse ran over.

Li Jun looked at Shen An’s pale face and asked worriedly, “What’s wrong with Teacher?”

Su Yan’s eyes turned red as she said, “I don’t know what’s wrong with Teacher either. He was talking to us just now, but now”

Towards the end, Su Yan’s voice choked.

Li Jun hurriedly stepped forward with his stethoscope and realized that Shen An’s heart was no longer beating. He gasped, and his fingers trembled. “Teacher, is is he dead?”

“Well”

“Auntie Su, don’t be too sad. I have a friend who works at the funeral home. Why don’t I take you there and so we can give him a proper funeral?” Qiao Nian turned to look at Su Yan and said in a low voice.

When Su Yan heard “Auntie Su”, she felt a little uncomfortable. However, when she saw Qiao Nian’s confident gaze, she nodded and said, “I’m Teacher’s disciple. I’m unfilial and didn’t take good care of Teacher. Junior Brother, can I take care of Teacher’s funeral?”

Li Jun nodded and said, “Yes.”

When Qiao Nian left, she glanced at the surveillance camera in the corner of the wall from the corner of her eye. However, she still pretended to be worried about Su Yan. “Auntie Su, don’t be sad. Dr. Shen passed away very peacefully.”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Su Yan nodded.
