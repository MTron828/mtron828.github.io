1335 Why are you crying?

The left side of Yu Chu’s face immediately swelled up. There were clear palm prints on her fair face, and blood was flowing from the corner of her mouth.

Bai Hui looked at Yu Chu, and her heart skipped a beat. She subconsciously wanted to show concern for Yu Chu, but she heard Yu Chu speak.

“Teacher, Second Sister-in-law is the person Brother Ah Zhou loves the most. Can you try to accept her?” Yu Chu’s voice trembled, and tears fell from her face one by one.

This was the first time her teacher had hit her.

In the past, no matter what she did, her teacher would not attack her, let alone be fierce.

“Why are you crying? How old are you? How embarrassing!” Bai Hui lowered her gaze slightly.

Yu Chu lowered her head, her body trembling slightly. She raised her hand to wipe her tears, sniffled, and said in a low voice, “I’m not crying.”

Bai Hui looked at the blood at the corner of Yu Chu’s mouth with heartache, but when she thought of what Yu Chu had just said, her anger surged again. She looked to the side and said gently, “Go and see the children. I’ll go see her.”

Yu Chu nodded.

Bai Hui looked at Yu Chu’s weak figure, her heart filled with regret. She shouldn’t have hit Yu Chu impulsively just now. She clenched her fists guiltily.

She had never hit Yu Chu before. Her right hand clenched into a fist, and her heart was filled with regret.

Bai Hui walked towards the living room. When she thought of Qiao Nian’s face, her expression darkened. How could such a woman marry Gu Zhou?

…

In the living room.

Qiao Nian sat on the sofa with a cold expression, her right leg crossed over her lap. She didn’t even look at the tea the servant had served. Her attention was all on the villa.

The decoration of this villa was very strange. The moment she entered, it was as if she had walked into a fairy tale world. Many children would probably like this place.

However, why did Bai Hui renovate it like this?

In her impression, Bai Hui was a cold and heartless woman.

She was strict with Gu Zhou.

How could such a Bai Hui like a renovation style that was filled with childishness?

At this moment, the sound of high heels came from afar. Qiao Nian looked up and saw Bai Hui walking in with a black suit.

Qiao Nian sized up Bai Hui’s face. Bai Hui was very beautiful. She had the kind of beauty that made one not dare to approach her easily.

Bai Hui gave Qiao Nian a sinister look. She walked to the sofa and calmly sat down opposite Qiao Nian. She glanced at Lu Zhu, and finally her gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face.

Bai Hui raised her left wrist and glanced at the time. She raised her eyebrows slightly and said to Qiao Nian, “I’m very busy. If you have something to say, say it!”

Bai Hui said expressionlessly, “My time is tight. Tell me what you want to say.”

Qiao Nian didn’t think of exchanging pleasantries with Bai Hui. She went straight to the point. “Return the children to me.”

When Bai Hui heard Qiao Nian’s words, she sneered and said, “Give them back to you? Who’s taking care of the children? Their great-grandmother?”

With that, she couldn’t help but laugh. The mockery in her eyes was obvious. “Back then, she couldn’t even educate her own children well. You found two children and threw them to her. She’s already so old. You asked her to take care of the children. I don’t think you can teach them well.”

Qiao Nian glanced at Bai Hui. Bai Hui didn’t seem to like the Gu family very much. She seemed to even hate Grandma.

She had heard Grandma talk about Bai Hui in the past. At that time, Bai Hui had divorced her ex-husband and was very unhappy.

Now was not the time to think about Bai Hui’s past. Her beautiful fox-like eyes narrowed coldly, and her voice hardened. “Now, I just want to take my children away. Please return them to me immediately. You don’t have to worry about educating the children. I can take good care of them myself.”

“Are you threatening me?” Bai Hui looked at Qiao Nian sharply, exuding a cold aura.

Lu Zhu sat on the other side. Looking at Bai Hui’s arrogant expression, his eyes were filled with displeasure. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Qiao Nian raised her chin slightly, her eyes turning cold. “I’m the mother of the children, not you!”

Mother?

Bai Hui frowned. A kind mother would raise failures. She taught her two children to be outstanding. Other children could not compare to her son at all.

How could a woman like Qiao Nian raise good children?

She looked at Qiao Nian quietly. After a long while, she said lightly, “So what?”
