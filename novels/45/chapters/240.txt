Chapter 241: Bet

Ye Ran was so angry at Qiao Nian’s shamelessness that tears fell from her eyes. She glared at Qiao Nian angrily. “Qiao Nian, you’re about to die, yet you refuse to admit it. How can you be so vile? What else do you want?”

Qiao Nian glanced at Ye Ran indifferently. Seeing that Ye Ran had gone crazy, her lips curved up slightly. “My ticket was given to me by my grandmother. It’s not hers at all.”

Professor Zhang looked at Qiao Nian’s sincere gaze without any worry. He had already believed Qiao Nian’s words.

However, some things still required evidence. Professor Zhang asked, “Then how are you going to prove that the ticket in your hand doesn’t belong to Ye Ran?”

When Qiao Nian heard Professor Zhang’s words, her heart warmed. It seemed that professors from famous schools were indeed different.

Qiao Nian’s gaze swept across all the students present. She said unhurriedly, “Everyone knows that Mr. Dong Hua’s tickets are very valuable. In order to prevent anyone from reselling fake tickets, every ticket has a special serial number. You can enter the official website to verify the authenticity of the tickets through the serial number. As long as you check that my ticket is not the same serial number as Ye Ran’s, you can prove that my ticket is not Ye Ran’s.”

Everyone’s gaze fell on Ye Ran’s face. Ye Ran looked at Qiao Nian in confusion. She wasn’t very clear about this matter, because her father hadn’t told her about the serial number.

Qiao Nian continued, “I remember that when Ye Ran took out the tickets yesterday, everyone took photos to commemorate the occasion. Now, as long as you open your photo album and see if her ticket matches my ticket number, you can prove my innocence.”

With that, Qiao Nian calmly placed the ticket on the table. In other words, she was handing over the appraisal rights to all her classmates. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Many students instantly liked Qiao Nian after what she did.

If Qiao Nian had really stolen Ye Ran’s tickets, it would have been impossible for her to show the tickets so openly for comparison.

Many students in the classroom believed that Qiao Nian hadn’t stolen Ye Ran’s tickets, so they couldn’t be bothered to appraise the tickets.

With resentment written all over her face, Ye Ran took out her phone and showed Qiao Nian her ticket. She said furiously, “You said it yourself. If this is my ticket, then stop quibbling. I want you to kneel down and apologize to me!”

Qiao Nian stepped forward and covered the ticket with her hand. She looked up at Ye Ran.

Seeing that Qiao Nian had covered the tickets, Ye Ran asked in amusement, “What’s wrong? Are you afraid to reveal the ticket?”

“No, I just want to ask you. If you’ve wronged me, will you kneel down and apologize to me, as well as compensate me for my mental damage? After all, my weak heart has been greatly damaged.”

When Ye Ran heard Qiao Nian’s words, she snorted. As if she was looking at a fool, she retorted, “How is that possible? I couldn’t have wronged you. You were the one who stole my tickets!”

Qiao Nian turned to look at Professor Zhang and said, “Professor Zhang, I want fairness.”

“Go on.” Professor Zhang looked at Qiao Nian.

The weakness in Qiao Nian’s eyes gradually disappeared, replaced by coldness. Her gaze was as sharp as a knife. Her gaze fell on Ye Ran’s face, frightening her so much that she took a step back.

Qiao Nian enunciated each word clearly. “If it’s proven that I stole Ye Ran’s tickets, I’ll drop out of school immediately and never be able to step foot into the music school again. If Ye Ran slanders me, she’ll have to apologize to me. Moreover, she’ll have to drop out immediately and never be able to come to the music school again!”

When everyone heard this, they burst into an uproar and sighed endlessly.

When Wang Xuan heard this, her lips curved up slightly. Her gaze fell on Ye Ran’s face. “If you framed Nian Nian, don’t cry and beg for forgiveness anymore!”

Ye Ran raised her head arrogantly and looked at Wang Xuan with disdain. “Fine, let’s bet. Do you think I’m afraid of your bluff?”

Wang Xuan smiled but said nothing.
