Chapter 255: Taking Advantage

Gao Lin didn’t take their sarcasm to heart at all. She raised her head high, like a peacock, and said proudly, “You can disagree with me, but you can’t disagree with Sister Xia Xue. Yesterday afternoon, when she was playing the violin in practice room 23, she caught the eye of Mr. Dong Hua’s assistant, Brother Cao. He felt that Sister Xia Xue was very talented. Since a female musician participating in Mr. Dong Hua’s concert had taken leave, Brother Cao invited her to replace her, and I’ll go over to help.”

After Gao Lin finished speaking, she glanced at everyone in the classroom. Seeing that they looked like they had never seen the world, her lips curved up slightly. “Why else would I say that your vision is really too narrow? All of you think that someone is so great just by attending a concert. You’re simply shallow!”

When Qiao Nian heard Gao Lin’s words, her breathing quickened. She had gone to that training room yesterday afternoon as well. Was Brother Cao there too?

But when she went in, she only knew that there was no one in the hall. She didn’t know if there was anyone in the small room.

It was also possible that she had missed the time when Brother Cao visited the training room. After all, she had only played a song on the violin in that training room.

Everyone else in the class was stunned. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

No one thought that Gao Lin was lying. Ever since Xia Xue entered university, she had been first in her grade every year. Everyone knew how outstanding she was.

Hence, they felt that it was possible that Xia Xue had caught Brother Cao’s eye.

However, Brother Cao was someone who had seen many things. How could he have taken a liking to Xia Xue?

Everyone had doubts, but no one dared to ask.

Seeing that Qiao Nian was frowning and didn’t speak, Gao Lin was instantly overjoyed. She couldn’t help but smile.

Gao Lin bent down slightly and moved her face closer to Qiao Nian. Smiling, she said, “Qiao Nian, don’t worry. Sister Xia Xue and I have met Mr. Dong Hua. Since we’re classmates, I’ll help you upgrade your VIP seat. What do you think?”

Gao Lin rested her chin on one hand, her eyes filled with smugness. She continued, “You don’t have to say anything more about being grateful. In the future, when you see me, you’ll have to tuck your tail between your legs. However, you have to kneel down and apologize to me now!”

When Qiao Nian heard Gao Lin’s words, she couldn’t help but laugh. Her voice was filled with sarcasm. “You’re also performing in Mr. Dong Hua’s concert?

Gao Lin gave a charming smile and continued, “I know you’re jealous. Brother Cao clearly told Sister Xia Xue that he invited her to participate in Mr. Dong Hua’s concert. I’m not spouting nonsense!”

Her smile grew brighter and brighter, but her smile did not reach her eyes. “Oh, so you were talking about Senior Xia Xue? I thought you were going to be a female musician in Mr. Dong Hua’s concert!”

Haha!

The class roared with laughter.

Gao Lin’s face turned pale with anger. She glared at Qiao Nian angrily and said, “What do you know? I’m the closest friend of Sister Xia Xue. She’ll definitely bring me along for the show. You ignorant country bumpkin!”

When Qiao Nian heard Gao Lin’s words, she was suddenly enlightened. She continued, “So Senior Xia Xue is holding a concert!”

Wang Xuan burst out laughing. She only stopped laughing after a long while. Her eyes were filled with ridicule as she said, “Gao Lin, you really know how to intimidate others with your power. When you become the female musician at Mr. Dong Hua’s concert in the future, you can come over and show off to us!”

“You…” Gao Lin was so angry that her hands were trembling. She pointed at Wang Xuan’s face, speechless for a long time.

She had initially wanted to take this opportunity to recruit a few followers so that they could deal with Qiao Nian and Wang Xuan. She hadn’t expected those two b*tches to be so eloquent. With just a few words, she had fallen into a disadvantageous position!
