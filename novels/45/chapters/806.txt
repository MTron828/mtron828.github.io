Su Xue met Qiao Shan’s gaze and shivered in fear. She had a bad feeling about this.

Recalling what Qiao Nian had just said, her expression turned even uglier.

Strange, how did that little b*tch Qiao Nian know that she used the money to keep a gigolo?

Could it be that Qiao Nian had already found out about her past?

!!

This was impossible. Previously, she had used many connections to investigate the whereabouts of the gigolo, but she had never found him.

Qiao Shan looked at Su Xue coldly and asked angrily, “You b*tch, you’re really despicable. Did you find a gigolo in the past?”

When Su Xue heard Qiao Shan’s words, her face turned pale. Tears of grievance flowed down her face. She shook her head vigorously and begged, “Hubby, you have to believe me. I really didn’t betray you!”

Even if she did, she wouldn’t admit it. Anyway, he hadn’t caught them in bed.

“Believe you? What else can I believe about you?” Qiao Shan was so angry that his temples were throbbing.

He had never expected Su Xue to have a gigolo outside.

That time, when he saw Su Xue sleeping with someone else, he was on the verge of breaking down.

In his heart, Su Xue had always been a gentle and virtuous woman.

Su Xue would tidy up the house and raise the two children.

Su Xue was the woman who had accompanied him for nearly thirty years.

Although he no longer loved Su Xue, he still had kinship with her.

All these years, he had never messed around with other women outside.

He knew that the reason why the Gu family was able to prosper was because he had been working hard outside and Su Xue had taken good care of the family.

He had initially thought that he and Su Xue were a match made in heaven. The male lead would be external facing, and the female lead would be internal facing. The two of them would never have any conflicts or disagreements.

But now, all of that had changed.

Ever since he found out that Su Xue was having an affair, he found it hard to believe her words.

“Hubby, believe me. I really didn’t have an affair in the past. I have to go to work and take care of you and the two children. How would I have the time to do that?” Su Xue looked at Qiao Shan with teary eyes and began to reflect on herself. “You can’t deny that I was sincere to you in the past because of my previous affair!”

As Su Xue spoke, tears streamed down her face. Her tear-stained face made one’s heart ache.

Seeing that Qiao Shan had been convinced, Su Xue said again, “Hubby, don’t believe Qiao Nian. She was spouting nonsense just now. She just doesn’t want us to reconcile. She doesn’t want us to be together. She wants our Qiao family to be ruined. She’s here to take revenge on our family!”

When Qiao Nian heard Su Xue’s words, she smiled coldly and said, “I’m not spouting nonsense!”

This was a great opportunity. How could Qiao Nian let Su Xue off the hook? She took out her phone and opened the transfer record Su Xue had given her, handing it to Qiao Shan.

However, Su Xue was right. She really didn’t want the Qiao family to be happy, nor did she want Su Xue and Qiao Shan to be happy.

Suppressing his anger, Qiao Shan took the phone from Qiao Nian and saw the transfer record. The other party’s account name was clearly written in it—Su Xue.

Su Xue had really transferred three million yuan to Qiao Nian.

Qiao Shan’s expression instantly darkened.

He had almost believed Su Xue’s words again.

He was simply too stupid.

How could he believe this slut over and over again?

He had been with Su Xue for so many years. He knew very well that Su Xue loved money.

A woman who loved money as much as her life. If she hadn’t done anything wrong, how could she have casually transferred the money to the Qiao Nian she hated the most?

Su Xue must be hiding something else from him.

Qiao Shan’s expression darkened. He recalled how Su Xue had looked in bed with the other man.

Su Xue’s lustful voice echoed in his ears, getting louder and louder.

He, Qiao Shan, had had a smooth-sailing life in the past and had two children.

He was also a successful person. He had brought the Qiao family’s career to greater heights, and the Qiao family was thriving in his hands.

Although his background was average, he had relied on his own efforts to bring the Qiao family into high society in An City.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates
