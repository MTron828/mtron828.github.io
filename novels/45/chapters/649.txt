Chapter 650: Two-timing

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Nian Nian?

Was Lu Zhu and Qiao Nian that close?

She had heard from others that Qiao Nian was the eldest daughter of the Qiao family.

The Qiao family was not well-known in An City. The only reason why the people of An City remembered the Qiao family was because Qiao Yu was a genius.

She had always regarded Lu Zhu as her idol, so she had investigated Lu Zhu’s relationship with the Qiao family. It seemed that the two families had a collaboration project.

Even if Lu Zhu was close to the Qiao family, Lu Zhu shouldn’t have anything to do with Qiao Nian.

Lu Zhu was addressing Qiao Nian like this now. Could it be that the two of them had some kind of secret relationship?

Suddenly, an idea struck her.

When she went to the Gu residence, she realized that Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou had a very ambiguous relationship.

Back then, after Qiao Nian finished speaking to Gu Zhou, Qiao Nian’s lips had a cut.

As an adult, Su Sheng naturally understood that Qiao Nian’s mouth had probably been bitten by Gu Zhou. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Qiao Nian was already with Gu Zhou. Why was she provoking Lu Zhu again?

Su Sheng suppressed her anger.

Just now, in the elevator, she had actually bragged in front of Qiao Nian that she was here to listen to Mr. Dong Hua’s new song.

At that moment, Qiao Nian’s expression darkened.

Qiao Nian must have been angry because she felt that she had touched Qiao Nian’s man.

In Qiao Nian’s heart, Lu Zhu was probably already Qiao Nian’s private property. No one was allowed to touch him.

If that was the case, Qiao Nian had gone too far.

Back when the two of them were in the car, Qiao Nian had said that she had never met Mr. Dong Hua. Now, she understood that not only was Qiao Nian on good terms with Mr. Dong Hua, but Qiao Nian was also two-timing. She played Lu Zhu and Gu Zhou like a fiddle.

The more Su Sheng thought about it, the more she felt that she was a clown. It was too embarrassing.

Gu Qing was chatting happily with Lu Zhu when she sensed that something was wrong with Su Sheng’s expression. She asked worriedly, “Su Sheng, are you feeling unwell? You look a little pale.”

Su Sheng smiled and shook her head.

Gu Qing looked at Su Sheng worriedly, her frown deepening. She poured a glass of water and handed it to Su Sheng. “Have some water first!”

“Thank you, Senior Sister.” Su Sheng obediently took the cup and stood at the side. She took a sip of water, and the uneasiness in her heart gradually dissipated.

Qiao Nian was a scheming person. It seemed that Qiao Nian was also here to listen to Mr. Dong Hua’s new song.

If she met Qiao Nian, she would probably live under Qiao Nian’s ridicule for the rest of her life.

The more Su Sheng thought about it, the more she felt that something was wrong. She didn’t want to stay here any longer.

Instead of waiting to be mocked, it was better to leave obediently.

Su Sheng placed the cup in her hand on the coffee table and looked up at Gu Qing, saying softly, “Senior Sister, I…”

“Where is Mr. Dong Hua? Did you call him?” Gu Qing asked, staring unblinkingly at Lu Zhu.

Su Sheng felt as if she had been struck by lightning. She looked at Gu Qing in disbelief.

What?

Mr. Lu Zhu wasn’t Mr. Dong Hua?

Su Sheng felt her throat go dry. She swallowed hard. Her entire world had been overturned.

“He should be here soon. He’ll send us a message when he arrives.” Lu Zhu glanced at the time on his wrist and said calmly.

“Okay,” Gu Qing replied.

Su Sheng’s face turned pale.

Could Mr. Lu Zhu really be Mr. Dong Hua?

Could it be that Mr. Dong Hua was really an old man, just like the rumors said?

At the thought of this, Su Sheng felt even worse.

But that wasn’t right either. When she had hypnotized Senior Sister, Senior Sister had clearly said that Mr. Dong Hua was Mr. Lu.

Could Senior Sister be referring to Lu Zhu’s father?

Su Sheng’s frown deepened.

Perhaps Senior Sister wasn’t hypnotized back then and was lying to her on purpose.

But why did Senior Sister do this?

What good would that do her?

Su Sheng’s heart was in turmoil. She was worried that Gu Qing would see through her thoughts. She lowered her head, not daring to speak.

Whenever Su Sheng thought of how Mr. Dong Hua was Lu Zhu’s father, her heart would flutter.

For a long time, every time she listened to Mr. Dong Hua’s songs, she would see Lu Zhu’s face.
