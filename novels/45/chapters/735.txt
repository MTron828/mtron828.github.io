736 I’m Your Husband

“Then do you remember how I once bit you?” Gu Zhou asked, his voice becoming gentle.

“I don’t remember anymore.” Qiao Nian pursed her lips slightly. Who would remember such a small memory? “I heard Grandma mention this before!”

When Qiao Nian finished speaking, a memory fragment flashed across her mind.

In a daze, she thought she saw a boy in a white shirt move closer to her face and bite hard.

Soon, this memory disappeared.

It made Qiao Nian feel that she had imagined it.

After all, she was especially young back then. How could she remember?

However, she could still vaguely feel that the place on her face where the boy had bitten her was burning. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Qiao Nian slowly closed her eyes and hurriedly threw these messy memories to the back of her mind.

It must be because she had heard about this scene too many times that she had such a fantasy.

Gu Zhou had been driving the entire time, so he naturally didn’t know what Qiao Nian was thinking. When he thought of how Qiao Nian hadn’t acknowledged the Lu family today, his expression turned serious. “The two of us are already husband and wife. We shouldn’t have any more secrets.”

Qiao Nian naturally understood what Gu Zhou meant. She turned to look at Gu Zhou and saw that he was driving seriously. Her gaze fell on the road in front of the car again.

Qiao Nian sighed and said with a serious expression, “Since you’ve already guessed my identity, you should know that the kidnapping twenty years ago wasn’t as simple as it seems. The fewer people who know about some things, the better. Moreover, the more people who know, the more danger I might be in. I don’t want my brothers who found me after much difficulty to lose me again. I’m afraid they won’t be able to accept this blow!”

Actually, Eldest Brother and Second Brother thought so too. They felt that as long as she was alive, their family would be reunited sooner or later.

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, his dark eyes darkened slightly. His voice became even stronger. “I’m not an outsider.”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, her heart couldn’t help but race. She recalled that night. She had actually asked him if he liked her.

At that time, Gu Zhou had given her a definite answer.

“I’m your husband. Besides, we were engaged in the past. The Lu and Gu families have been good friends for a hundred years. No matter what happens, I won’t put you in danger, and I can’t let you be hurt in any way.”

Qiao Nian’s heart was beating faster and faster. At this moment, she clearly realized that she was in Gu Zhou’s heart.

At this moment, the car arrived at the entrance of the Gu family villa. Gu Zhou stopped the car. He turned to look at Qiao Nian and touched her face.

Her face was smooth and soft.

Gu Zhou’s eyes gradually darkened. His throat moved involuntarily. “Nian’er, you have to believe me!”

Gu Zhou saw Qiao Nian’s expression change. She shrank back and moved away from his hand.

Gu Zhou didn’t understand what he had said wrong. Why was Qiao Nian so wary of him?

Just as he was about to speak, he heard Qiao Nian say, “Gu Chuan?”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he frowned slightly.

This was the second time Qiao Nian had said this name in front of him.

Gu Zhou retracted his hand and looked at Qiao Nian seriously. “Nian’er, can you tell me who Gu Chuan is?”

Previously, he had asked Chen Qing to investigate information about Gu Chuan, but he did not manage to find anything.

This was because Chen Qing had found out that those people named Gu Chuan were not people Qiao Nian liked at all.

When Qiao Nian heard his words, she frowned slightly. Only then did she realize that he was Gu Zhou, not Gu Chuan.

Qiao Nian thought that since she and Gu Zhou had already confessed, she no longer wanted to hide it from Gu Zhou. Hence, she enunciated each word clearly. “Gu Chuan is actually you!”

Gu Zhou was stunned. His frown deepened.

Qiao Nian knew in her heart that no matter who it was, they wouldn’t be able to accept it immediately.

She held Gu Zhou’s hand tightly and said seriously, “Gu Zhou, since you asked me to trust you, I won’t lie to you anymore. You might not believe me, but Gu Chuan is really you!”
