891 Sister, Let Me Do It!

In the ward.

Gu Qi sat on a small stool beside the bed and guarded Xiao Shi. Thinking of what Uncle Chen Qing had said, he looked at Xiao Shi with heartache.

In her sleep, there were still tears in the corners of her eyes. When Gu Qi saw Xiao Shi like this, his heart ached. He reached out and carefully wiped her tears away.

His movements were very light, and he was very worried that he would wake Xiao Shi up.

At this moment, Xiao Shi’s eyelashes trembled slightly. She slowly opened her eyes, and the scene of Song Man jumping out of the window flashed in front of her.

Tears instantly welled up in her eyes.

“Sister, what’s wrong? Are you feeling unwell?” Gu Qi didn’t understand why Xiao Shi was crying again. In a panic, he picked up a tissue from the bedside table and carefully wiped her tears.

When she saw Gu Qi, she was slightly stunned. There were still tears on her face.

Holding a tissue, Gu Qi carefully wiped Xiao Shi’s tears. He asked softly, “Sister, if you’re not feeling well, I’ll call the doctor over!”

When she saw Gu Qi, she felt much better. She shook her head and sat up.

Gu Qi hurriedly raised Xiao Shi’s pillow and placed it behind her.

Xiao Shi was slightly stunned. After some hesitation, she leaned against the bed uneasily.

This was the first time someone had taken the initiative to raise her pillow.

“Brother!” Xiao Shi called out softly. When she saw Gu Qi frown, she immediately fell silent.

Gu Qi slid down from the chair and stood beside the bedside table. He poured a glass of hot water and handed it to Xiao Shi. “Sister, is your throat uncomfortable? You’ll be fine after drinking some hot water!”

Only then did Xiao Shi realize that Gu Qi did not despise her voice just now. Instead, he was worried that she was feeling unwell.

Obediently, she took the cup from him. Holding it with both hands, she gulped down the water.

After drinking a cup of water, she realized that she was indeed very thirsty. With this thought in mind, her gaze fell on the bedside table. Just as she was about to crawl over and pour some water, the cup in her hand was taken away by Gu Qi.

“Sister, let me do it!” As Gu Qi spoke, he was already standing by the bedside table, pouring water for Xiao Shi. Then, he handed the cup to her.

Xiao Shi did not take the cup immediately. She just stared at it, her eyes red-rimmed.

In the past, no matter what, she was the one who took care of herself and Mommy.

Even if she had a fever and felt unwell, she had to get up and take care of her mommy.

No, Song Man was no longer her mommy.

She had long been used to doing things herself. She had never dreamed that her brother would be taking care of her now.

Although she was not used to being taken care of, she could feel the warmth of her brother taking care of her.

Xiao Shi took the cup from Gu Qi and said, “Thank you, Brother!”

Gu Qi looked at Xiao Shi in confusion, then shook his head and said disapprovingly, “Xiao Shi, you shouldn’t have thanked me!”

Xiao Shi looked at Gu Qi in confusion. Had she said something wrong?

“Xiao Shi, Mommy said that you’re our little princess. Everyone should know that I’m your brother. I have to take care of you more!”

Xiao Shi’s eyes turned red uncontrollably.

In the past, when she was with Song Man, she always said that she was a junior and had to take good care of her elders. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Xiao Shi blinked and looked at Gu Qi in confusion. She asked impatiently, “Did you just say Mommy? Has Daddy already found our biological mother? Where is she? I want to see her!”

Gu Qi shook his head and smiled brightly. “Although Daddy hasn’t found our biological mother for us, I’ve already asked Auntie Nian Nian to be my mommy!”

Auntie Nian Nian?

Become his mommy?

Xiao Shi looked at the happy smile on Gu Qi’s face, and her eyes gradually dimmed. She recalled how Auntie Nian Nian had hugged her previously, and how Auntie Nian Nian had told her a bedtime story.

Auntie Nian Nian was really gentle.

She was a little envious of Gu Qi because Gu Qi could make Auntie Nian Nian his mommy.

The twins seemed to have telepathy. Gu Qi seemed to understand what was on Xiao Shi’s mind and asked, “Xiao Shi, what do you think of Auntie Nian Nian?”
