848 Envy

Three in the afternoon.

At Chang’an Cafe.

This was the city center of An City. Every inch of land here was worth gold. Rich people usually liked to spend their time here.

At this moment, in the private room on the second floor.

2:30 P.M.

Qiao Xin was wearing a suit. She took out a mirror from her bag and looked into it. She carefully tidied her collar, combed her hair, and touched up her makeup. When she was done, she looked at Qiao Yu happily.

“Brother, what do you think of my outfit? Do I look like a mature white-collar worker?” Qiao Xin asked expectantly.

Qiao Yu had been looking at his phone. When he heard Qiao Xin’s words, he glanced at her, his eyes filled with gentleness and doting. “Yes, you look good!”

When Qiao Xin heard Qiao Yu’s words, she heaved a sigh of relief. She was still a little nervous. “I just hope that we can leave a good impression on the director of Nanshan! I hope they can work with us!”

Qiao Yu nodded in agreement. His sister had finally grown up. “You’re right. I hope that we can get a partnership with Nanshan this time. Nanshan is a big company. I heard that their director is very mysterious. This time, they were the ones who reached an agreement with the government. It’s obvious that Nanshan’s strength can’t be underestimated. You have to know that the Gu and Lu families have both lost to him.”

When Qiao Xin heard Qiao Yu’s words, she asked worriedly, “Brother, do you think we can get a collaboration this time?”

Initially, Qiao Xin had thought that the Qiao family would be able to get this collaboration easily. However, when she thought of the strength of the Gu and Lu families, she felt a little scared.

Nanshan Corporation had been too low-profile in the past, so it wasn’t well-known in An City. However, she had previously found out that the company had originally started in the United States and only came to the country later.

Qiao Yu was not confident either. He said seriously, “It doesn’t matter if we can get this collaboration. As long as we can get along well with Nanshan Corporation, we might have a chance to work together in the future. Xiao Xin, you’ve grown up a lot now and know a lot more.”

When Qiao Xin heard Qiao Yu’s words, she nodded seriously. Qiao Nian’s face flashed across her mind again.

Qiao Nian was clearly not much older than her, but she was already the principal of a school, and she was just an ordinary student. Moreover, Qiao Nian had published many important papers.

Later on, she read the medical papers Qiao Nian had published. She had heard from others that not every thesis was valuable. In order to become famous, some people wrote less valuable essays to put on an act.

Perhaps Qiao Nian’s theses were just for show.

The only thing she was sure of was that Qiao Nian could grow those herbs to make her rich.

So what if that was the case?

Qiao Nian was just an upstart. She couldn’t be compared to a rich family like the Qiao family.

As long as she worked hard and made use of the Qiao family’s abilities, she would be ahead of Qiao Nian in her career.

She didn’t want to fall behind a country bumpkin like Qiao Nian.

She wanted Qiao Nian to see clearly that she was the precious daughter of the Qiao family. She was not someone a country bumpkin like Qiao Nian could compare to.

“Brother, after experiencing so much, I’ve really grown up. I’ll work hard in the future and become as outstanding as you. I’ll let our Qiao family take another step forward!”

After saying this, Qiao Xin added silently to herself.

In the future, she will ask Qiao Nian to kneel in front of her and apologize.

Qiao Yu nodded in satisfaction.

Previously, his parents’ incident had given him a headache, and it had also caused the Qiao family to fall into a short-term crisis. Fortunately, his sister could already stand up and take charge.

At this moment, someone knocked twice on the door of the private room.

Qiao Yu and Qiao Xin looked at each other and knew that the person had arrived.

“Please come in!” Qiao Yu stood up and said calmly.

Qiao Xin quickly stood up, putting on a humble facade.

The door of the private room opened and the waiter walked in. He walked to the door and gestured for her to enter.

“Miss, please come in!”

Qiao Yu and Qiao Xin kept staring at the door.

At this moment, when the two of them saw the devastatingly beautiful woman at the door, they were both stunned.

Qiao Xin’s eyes widened. Her eyeballs were about to fall out of their sockets.

She almost lost her balance and fell into a chair. Fortunately, she held onto the table in advance. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

How could it be her?
