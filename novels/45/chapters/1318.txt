1319 Mute!

Cui Huai was more willing to believe Chen Quan’s words.

At that time, he had seen Gu Yue’s corpse. That corpse was Gu Yue’s face.

At that time, Dao Wen was the person he trusted the most. He asked Dao Wen to deal with Gu Yue’s corpse. Chen Quan did not interfere in the rest. In fact, Chen Quan could not interfere at all. After all, at that time, Chen Quan had no power or influence.

Chen Quan looked calm. He didn’t look like he was lying at all.

On the contrary, Dao Wen was like a cornered dog. In order to achieve his goal of framing Chen Quan, he would say anything.

It seemed that Dao Wen was really a traitor!

Cui Huai looked at Dao Wen with killing intent in his eyes. “How dare you collude with Gu Zhou’s people!”

Dao Wen had been following Cui Huai the entire time. When he saw Cui Huai’s gaze, he knew in his heart that Cui Huai must have believed Chen Quan’s words.

He hurriedly explained. His mouth opened and closed, but he seemed to have become mute and could not speak!

Since he couldn’t say a word, he would hand the evidence to Chen Quan. With this thought in mind, Dao Wen wanted to show Cui Huai the pocket watch Chang Feng had given him. He lowered his head and realized that the pocket watch had disappeared.

Dao Wen was as anxious as a cat on a hot tin roof. He gestured, wanting to express what he wanted to say.

However, Cui Huai no longer had the patience. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Seeing Dao Wen like this, he frowned and said impatiently, “Bring him down and feed him to the fish! I’m annoyed when I see him!”

He had already given Dao Wen a chance to explain just now, but he did not expect Dao Wen’s words to be completely unconvincing. Dao Wen was just short of saying that the dead were alive.

Sha He had always been following him. He believed Sha He’s words, as well as Ba Song’s.

Since they had already said that Dao Wen was a traitor, it meant that Dao Wen was really a traitor.

Sha He nodded and pulled Dao Wen out to feed the fish.

Dao Wen finally spat out a few words. “Chang Feng is really a traitor!”

When Cui Huai heard Dao Wen’s words, a trace of coldness flashed in his eyes.

Sha He was so angry that he kicked Cui Huai in the stomach. With a sinister expression, he said, “How dare you frame Chang Feng? I saw with my own eyes that Qiao Nian cared about you. How do you want to explain yourself?”

Dao Wen’s eyes were red. Ba Song said angrily, “Shut up, you useless fellow. You said that others are traitors. Why don’t you take a look at yourself first!”

Dao Wen looked at Sha He and Ba Song in confusion.

With a cold expression, Sha He dragged Dao Wen out.

At the thought that Chang Feng was still in the operating theater after saving him, Ba Song vented all his anger on Dao Wen. “I’ll go with you!”

Dao Wen struggled hard. He kept looking at Cui Huai, hoping that he would believe him.

However, Cui Huai did not even look at him.

Dao Wen looked at Chen Quan and saw him talking to Mr. Cui calmly. At this moment, he finally understood how badly he had lost.

Six years ago, Chen Quan had already made him a sacrificial lamb.

No, Gu Yue had already made him a sacrificial lamb, scapegoat. Gu Yue had done all of this to clear his name in front of Cui Huai!

It was rumored that Gu Yue was the cold-blooded King of Hell. At that time, he didn’t believe it and even followed Chen Quan to kill Gu Yue.

But at this moment, he understood that the rumors were true. Gu Yue was really the cold-blooded King of Hell. He had sent himself to the King of Hell!

The funniest thing was that Mr. Cui would only trust Gu Yue more and more now.

Why?

Why was this happening?

He was clearly not a spy. Why didn’t Mr. Cui believe him?

Dao Wen’s gaze fell on Cui Huai’s face, and a trace of coldness flashed in his eyes. He knew that Cui Huai was no match for Chen Quan, so he would go to the underworld to wait for him.

Seeing Dao Wen leave, Chen Quan lowered his gaze slightly, looking as if he didn’t want to say anything.

Cui Huai knew that what he had just done had made Chen Quan unhappy. He reached out and patted Chen Quan’s shoulder, praising him. “You’ve made another contribution this time. If it weren’t for you, we wouldn’t have been able to catch the traitor. Finding the traitor is very important to us. We’ll definitely complete the mission perfectly next time.”

A faint smile appeared on Chen Quan’s lips. He looked up at Cui Huai and said humbly, “Mr. Cui, you flatter me. This is my duty.”

After a pause, Chen Quan looked out, his eyes cold. “I really didn’t expect Dao Wen to be a traitor.”

At the mention of Dao Wen, Cui Huai got angry. He trusted Dao Wen so much that he had asked him to monitor Chen Quan.
