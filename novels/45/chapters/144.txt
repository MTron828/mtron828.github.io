Chapter 145 Broaden Her Horizons

“Yue Yue, I’ve suddenly remembered something. Is that woman still staying at your house?” Liu Yu asked, looking perplexed.

“She hasn’t left.” Jiang Yue pursed her lips. When she thought of Qiao Nian, the light in her eyes dimmed involuntarily. She continued, “She stayed behind to treat Grandma’s illness.”

Liu Yu was slightly stunned. Her eyes immediately filled with disdain. She spoke, “Treating Grandma? Yue Yue, are you joking? You’re also a top student in the medical academy, and you’re certified to be a doctor. You can treat your grandmother yourself, right? Why are you letting outsiders treat your grandmother?”

Jiang Yue smiled and said, “She’s quite capable. Moreover, Grandma trusts her a lot.”

Liu Yu frowned. When she spoke to persuade Jiang Yue, she sounded as though she had a lot of experience dealing with matters like these. “Yue Yue, I’m not trying to be a busybody. However, I think that since she’s already moved into your house, you should be more careful. You have to know that many girls nowadays would go to great lengths to marry into a rich family, but if they want to truly be a part of an elite family, the first thing they have to do is to please the elderly matriarchs or patriarchs.”

The smile on Jiang Yue’s face froze for a moment. Then, she smiled again and said, “Actually, it’s not as complicated as you think. Moreover, she will be attending this speech as well. Then, you’ll be able to meet her.”

Liu Yu looked at Jiang Yue with her face full of worry, saying helplessly, “Yue Yue, you’re too kind. You don’t have an ounce of vigilance. By the way, why is she attending our lecture? In what capacity will she be attending?”

Jiang Yue said hesitantly, “It might have been Grandma who wanted me to take her there. She said that it would broaden her horizons.”

Hearing Jiang Yue’s words, Liu Yu’s eyes widened to the size of dinner plates. She quickly said, “Yue Yue, you’re so naive. If someone kidnaps you and sells you, you’ll be the one helping them count the money.”

Jiang Yue smiled, shaking her head. “Surely it’s not as serious as that?”

“Yue Yue, I’m telling you. If your grandmother said that, it means that she likes her very much. That’s not a good thing.”

Liu Yu said earnestly, “Do hurry up and tell me her name. I’ll get my uncle to help you investigate her background. My uncle is a top-notch hacker. If you want to investigate someone, he’ll be able to find information on every single one of their ancestors for you.” Jiang Yue’s hand, which was holding the cup, paused for a moment. She looked up. “That isn’t appropriate!”

“I’ll just check up on her for you. What’s wrong with that? We’re not doing anything to her,” Liu Yu said. “Moreover, if we investigate thoroughly, we’ll be able to confirm whether she’s a threat to your grandmother. This is also for the sake of your grandmother’s safety.”

Jiang Yue lowered her gaze, thinking hard. After a long moment of hesitation, she said, “Qiao Nian.”

When Liu Yu heard Jiang Yue’s words, she hurriedly took out her phone and sent the name to her uncle. She left a message: [Uncle, help me investigate someone called Qiao Nian. The sooner, the better. See if you can get any dirt on her.] Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

After Liu Yu sent the message, she smiled at Jiang Yue and said, “Alright, this matter has been settled.”

Jiang Yue gave a faint smile and lowered her gaze. Her long, sweeping eyelashes hid the coldness in her eyes.

“Yue Yue, I think it’s better if you treat your grandmother’s illness yourself. That way, she won’t have anything to do with your family, and she can leave your house as soon as possible,” Liu Yu reminded her kindly.

Jiang Yue nodded with a smile. Actually, she had been studying Grandma’s illness as well.

For the next few days, Jiang Yue spent all her time working on the script she would need for her speech. This would be the first time she ever stood on a stage to give a speech. The honor was immense, and it belonged to her. She would not allow herself to make any mistakes.

Matriarch Gu was no longer willing to leave the house either. There were many areas in the gown that required sewing by hand. Wearing a pair of reading glasses, she was sewing the gown together bit by bit.
