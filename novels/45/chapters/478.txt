Chapter 479: Begging

Xu Qian looked at Song Yue sympathetically.

Song Yue hurriedly said, “Please, if the doctor and the other nurses don’t ask about this, can you not tell anyone?”

Xu Qian lowered her eyes and said calmly, “I won’t take your money, but Dr. Qiao isn’t from here. If she tells Mr. Lu, then it has nothing to do with me.”

Moreover, Xu Qian suspected that Qiao Nian didn’t donate blood. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Song Yue was slightly stunned. Her entire body was cold, as if she had fallen into an ice cave.

How could Qiao Nian let go of such a good opportunity?

Qiao Nian was probably eager to show off in front of Lu Zhu.

Xu Qian’s gaze landed on Qiao Nian’s face. She said calmly, “I won’t tell Mr. Lu. Let nature take its course!”

At this moment, Song Yue couldn’t listen to anything. She sat on the spot in a daze.

At this moment, Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou stayed by Lu Zhu’s bed, hoping that he would wake up soon.

Gu Zhou glanced at Qiao Nian and saw that she was staring at Lu Zhu. Her face was pale, and the corners of her mouth were pale. “Go and rest for a while.”

Qiao Nian’s gaze landed on Gu Zhou’s face. She pursed her lips slightly and said, “I want to see him wake up with my own eyes!”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Gu Zhou’s eyes gradually darkened. He no longer tried to persuade Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou and asked softly, “Gu Zhou, can you promise me something?”

“Tell me.”

Gu Zhou’s voice was calm, his expression normal. It was as if no matter what Qiao Nian said, he would agree.

Qiao Nian turned to look at Lu Zhu again. Recalling the hemolytic reaction between her and Lu Zhu’s blood in the operating theater, her breathing involuntarily quickened. She said softly, “Don’t tell him about my blood transfusion.”

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian in confusion. He had never expected Qiao Nian to make such a request.

“Why?”

“I just don’t want him to feel burdened!” Qiao Nian looked calmly at Gu Zhou and pursed her lips.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian with a complicated expression. “Burdened?”

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou sincerely and explained slowly, “Previously, I entered Ghost City alone to save him. Logically speaking, the two of us are even now. If he finds out that I gave him a blood transfusion, I think he might feel burdened.”

Actually, Qiao Nian was lying.

She wasn’t sure what her identity was yet, so she wanted to give herself a way out.

Moreover, Lu Zhu’s sister was also a medical student. She should know very well that only relatives could not donate blood to each other.

If Lu Zhu knew that she had donated blood, he would not suspect that she was related to him by blood.

Her and Lu Zhu’s identities could not be made public yet.

She had come into contact with the Lu family before. Everyone in the Lu family was on the same side, but there were also many others in the Lu family. Moreover, the others did not say that they had lost their daughter.

Hence, Qiao Nian couldn’t confirm her identity at all. Under such circumstances, she subconsciously wanted to maintain the status quo and slowly investigate the Lu family.

Furthermore, she had already taken a sample of her hair and Lu Zhu’s hair for a paternity test. Before the paternity test was done, she had to nip all dangers at the bud.

She had to survive!

She worked hard to stay alive all these years. Even if she couldn’t find her family, she had to make sure she stayed alive.

If someone in the Lu family had previously thought that she should not survive in this world, and was supposed to be abandoned, then she did not intend to acknowledge her family.

However, if there was any misunderstanding between her and the Lu family, she had to investigate it before reuniting with her family.
