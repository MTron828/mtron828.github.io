Chapter 322: Short of Money

“Come over for breakfast.”

When Gu Qi heard Gu Zhou’s words, his eyes lit up. He handed his hand to Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou looked at Gu Qi’s small hand and was slightly stunned.

Seeing this, Gu Qi suddenly felt a wave of disappointment. He lowered his head, wanting to retract his hand.

In the next moment, Gu Zhou took his small hand and rubbed it gently. There was a vague sense of familiarity.

This feeling was similar to when he had held Qiao Nian’s hand previously.

It was small and soft.

Gu Qi looked at his hand, which was being held by his father. A faint smile appeared on his face.

Actually, what made Gu Qi the happiest was not his father holding his hand, but what he had just heard from his father and Uncle Chen Qing.

All this time, he had mistaken his mother for someone else. So his mother was still alive.

His mother must be waiting for him to find her.

He had to work hard to find his mother.

During the meal, Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on Gu Qi’s face. In the past, he had always arranged Gu Qi’s life directly. He had never asked Gu Qi for his opinion.

This time, he wanted Gu Qi to make the decision, so he asked, “Do you want to go to school and study with other children?”

Gu Qi stopped drinking his milk for a moment, then swallowed it. He looked at Gu Zhou expectantly and asked carefully, “Can I?”

“Of course.”

Suppressing his laughter, Gu Qi nodded.

Gu Zhou turned to look at Chen Qing and said, “Help Gu Qi with the admission procedures today.”

Gu Zhou thought that if he let Gu Qi play with children his age, Gu Qi’s reclusiveness might improve.

Chen Qing answered, “Yes.”

Gu Qi finished his breakfast in silence and returned to his room.

Worried, Gu Zhou sat on the sofa in Gu Qi’s room. Seeing Gu Qi lower his head and do what he liked, he heaved a sigh of relief.

Fu Hang glanced at his watch. There were still four hours until Lu Nian’s concert.

Gu Qi took out his phone and logged into her game. A stranger’s private message box instantly reached 999+.

Gu Qi ignored the private messages and logged into the gaming hall.

[Oh my god, the great god is here!]

[The great god is finally online!]

[I sent 500 messages to the great god, but the system blacklisted me. However, the great god didn’t reply! Sob sob sob!]

[The aloofness of the great god is not something you can touch!]

Gu Qi sat there and sent a voice message.

“Where are the players who wanted me to score points with them previously?”

[Look at me, Great God!]

[I’m raising my hands!]

[I’m here, begging for mercy, great god!]

[Great God, I’ve been stuck in Starshine for three weeks. Save me!]

[Great God, my level 10 account allows me to share all my skins. Please bring me to the national ranks!]

…

The chat box in the hall refreshed very quickly. Gu Qi couldn’t read it at all.

Gu Qi was still young and did not know many words. Looking at the complicated words, he frowned.

He ranked first in the national server every season. Many people in the game wanted him to help them score points, but he only played solo, so he ignored everyone’s requests to team up.

But the situation was different.

He already owed a huge sum of 15 dollars.

He wondered how many games he would have to play to earn it back.

Gu Qi didn’t want to owe anyone money at all. In order to pay it off as soon as possible, he sent a voice message.

“The highest bidder will have priority!”

As soon as this message was sent, the chat room in the gaming hall exploded.

“Ahhh!!!” Wang Xuan cried out excitedly.

When Qiao Nian heard Wang Xuan’s voice, she frowned slightly and asked in confusion, “What’s wrong?”

“Do you know who ranked first in the national server?” Wang Xuan handed her phone to Qiao Nian.

This was a national-famous competitive game, and she was playing it too.

“I know. It’s Mr. Q.”

Speaking of which, she had always been ranked second in the national server. The first place in the national server had always been occupied by Mr. Q. Later on, she went to study plant cultivation, and stopped playing games.
