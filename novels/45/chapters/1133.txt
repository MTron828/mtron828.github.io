1134 Uncle?

“It was at the banquet your brother held previously. I remember that it was a charity banquet. You also appeared at the auction house,” Qin Chuan said with a smile.

Lu Qi knew about the charity banquet her brother was holding, but she didn’t seem to have seen Qin Chuan before.

“I remember…” Qin Chuan paused for a moment and continued, “At that time, you were wearing a white T-shirt, a denim pleated skirt, and a pair of sneakers. At that time, you were wearing a bow on your head. You were acting cute with your brother.”

Lu Qi was instantly enlightened. All her attention was on Qin Chuan’s last sentence, and her face turned red.

!!

That was her dark history!

At that time, her classmates all had computers. She also wanted a computer, so she wheedled to her brother, hoping that he would help her buy a computer.

However, Big Brother felt that high school students shouldn’t touch computers. He even said that if he bought a computer for her, she would lose her mind and not study hard.

She didn’t expect Qin Chuan to see this. She felt a little awkward now.

Seeing Lu Qi’s face turn visibly red, Qin Chuan’s gaze gradually landed on her feet. He seemed to recall the young lady in the pleated skirt and sneakers. He smiled and said, “I didn’t expect that you still like to wear sneakers.”

Lu Qi smiled shyly and said, “Sports shoes are comfortable!”

Due to her conversation with Qin Chuan, Lu Qi felt that it might be a little distant to call him Mr. Qin in the future. She asked, “How should I address you?”

When Qin Chuan heard Lu Qi’s words, he knew that Lu Qi was already familiar with her. His eyes narrowed slightly. “In the future, if you call me…”

Brother or Brother Chuan.

However, before Qin Chuan could finish speaking, Lu Qi said happily, “I got it. Why don’t I call you Uncle in the future?”

The smile on Qin Chuan’s face instantly froze.

???

Uncle???

Did he look old?

Why was there such a huge gap in seniority?

Lu Qi smiled at Qin Chuan and said considerately, “Uncle, you must be very busy. Why don’t you go ahead and do your work? I’ll take a taxi back myself!”

Qin Chuan put away the smile on his face and said indifferently, “I’ll send you back!”

After that, Qin Chuan put away the medicine box and placed it in the back seat. He started the engine and stepped on the accelerator.

As he drove, Qin Chuan couldn’t help but glance at his face in the rearview mirror.

Did he really look old?

He was about the same age as Lu Zhu, and Qiao Nian called him Old Qin. They were clearly of the same generation. Why did Lu Qi call them Brother and Sister? He was clearly only nine years older than Lu Qi, so why did Lu Qi call him Uncle?

He knew that there was definitely a generation gap between him and Lu Qi, but the generation gap between their thoughts shouldn’t be so big! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qin Chuan retracted his gaze sadly and drove towards the Lu family.

In less than half an hour, Qin Chuan drove to the entrance of the Lu family!

Lu Qi unbuckled her seatbelt and got out of the car with a smile. She walked around the car to the driver’s seat.

Qin Chuan stared unblinkingly at Lu Qi. Seeing Lu Qi walk to the driver’s door, he naturally rolled down the window. Before he could speak, Lu Qi smiled and spoke.

“Uncle Qin, thank you for sending me back!”

Qin Chuan was about to vomit blood!

Hearing the word “Qin”, he suddenly thought of his grandfather!

In the past, many people in the village had called him Grandpa, Uncle Qin!

Qin Chuan took a deep breath, opened the door, and got out of the car. He stood in front of Lu Qi and looked down at her. He pursed his lips slightly and thought for a while before saying with a serious expression, “Don’t call me Uncle in the future!”

Lu Qi looked at Qin Chuan in confusion. She blinked in confusion and asked innocently, “But you’re clearly old enough to be my uncle!”

Qin Chuan felt a blow to his heart. He actually couldn’t refute Lu Qi’s words!

He thought for a moment before saying, “Your sister is calling me Senior but you’re calling me Uncle now. Then should your sister change her form of address?”

“There’s no need. We’re not relatives. There’s a difference between Sister and me. If I call you Brother, won’t that be too disrespectful to you? I call you Uncle because I’m being polite!” Lu Qi said with a sweet smile.
