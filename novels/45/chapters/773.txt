Gu Zhou didn’t speak. His gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face, as if he was waiting for her answer.

Qiao Nian glanced at Xiao Shi, her heart aching terribly. Xiao Shi must have been frightened by Gu Zhou just now.

Previously, she had told Xiao Shi that her father was very gentle and would like her a lot.

However, Gu Zhou revealed a stern side.

Qiao Nian sighed softly and said, “Xiao Qi’s stomach isn’t feeling well. I’ve checked for him. It’s because of accumulation.”

After receiving Qiao Nian’s affirmative answer, Gu Zhou’s gaze instantly softened. He walked up to Gu Qi and squatted down, his eyes filled with undisguised worry. “Xiao Qi, how does your stomach feel now?”

When she met Gu Zhou’s gaze, her eyes instantly turned red.

She had just been thinking that although her father was very handsome, his words were cold.

But now, her father spoke to her very gently. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Her father’s gaze on her was also very gentle. She had experienced this gentleness from Auntie Nian Nian.

But her mommy had never looked at her with such gentleness.

Seeing that Gu Qi had not spoken, Gu Zhou realized that he was a little dazed. He couldn’t help but frown and place his hand on her forehead to test her.

She didn’t seem to have a fever!

Even though his father had already taken his hand away, she could still feel the warmth on the back of his father’s hand.

Xiao Shi couldn’t help but blush.

So her father was so good to her.

“Daddy, I’ve already taken my medicine. I’m fine now. You don’t have to worry about me!”

When Gu Zhou heard Gu Qi’s words, he seemed to pause for a moment. He felt that Gu Qi was a little strange.

Gu Qi was very smart and knew everything, but Gu Qi was rarely so enthusiastic.

Seeing Gu Qi gradually become more lively and cheerful, Gu Zhou gradually heaved a sigh of relief.

It seemed that Qiao Nian was right. Gu Qi could become extroverted.

Gu Zhou slowly stood up. His gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face and he asked in a low voice, “His stomach isn’t feeling well. Is there anything I need to pay attention to in the future?”

Qiao Nian said that her stomach wasn’t feeling well. It was just a lie she and Xiao Shi had made up.

Qiao Nian shook her head and said, “There’s no need.”

Her gaze fell on Xiao Shi’s face again. Xiao Shi had come to the Gu family because she wanted to interact more with Gu Zhou. How should she create an opportunity for Gu Zhou and Xiao Shi to be alone?

Suddenly, an idea flashed across Qiao Nian’s mind. Her lips curved up slightly as she said, “I think although Xiao Qi doesn’t have to go to school today, he should still study more at home. I wonder if you have time to tutor him in the afternoon?”

In the end, Qiao Nian added, “Moreover, Xiao Qi also hopes that you can tutor him in his studies.”

A trace of surprise flashed in Gu Zhou’s eyes.

Gu Qi had liked to be alone in the past, so he didn’t disturb him.

But now, Gu Qi hoped that he could tutor him.

How could Gu Zhou be willing to miss the opportunity to get closer to Gu Qi?

“I’m free!” As Gu Zhou spoke, his gaze fell on Gu Qi’s face. He saw Gu Qi smiling at him.

Gu Zhou’s lips curved up imperceptibly. “What do you want to learn this afternoon?”

Xiao Shi’s eyes, which were like black grapes, were especially wide open. She stared unblinkingly at Gu Zhou. Her father was really too gentle and treated her too well.

“I want to study mathematics.” Xiao Shi had casually made up a reason. Although she had already taught herself these things when she was in Hai Cheng, she wanted to hear her father teach her mathematics.

“Okay,” Gu Zhou replied. He took out his phone and sent a message to Chen Qing.

“Cancel all activities today!”

After Gu Zhou sent the message, he placed his phone in his pocket. In his opinion, nothing was more important than Gu Qi’s matter.

He reached out to Gu Qi and prepared to pull him back to his room.

Xiao Shi’s gaze fell on her father’s palm, and her ears turned redder and redder. Carefully, she placed her hand on her father’s and followed him upstairs.
