When he first entered the room, he had seen a wound at the corner of Qiao Nian’s mouth.

At that time, he had thought that the wound on Qiao Nian’s mouth was caused by inflammation in her mouth. He had never expected Second Brother to bite her.

Second Brother was too ruthless.

He wondered if Qiao Nian was hurt.

Seeing that Gu Qing and Lu Nian were both looking at Qiao Nian’s lips, Su Sheng said unhappily, “Mr. Dong Hua, have you seen this person’s true colors? Not only is she in an ambiguous relationship with Gu Zhou, but she also has a very ambiguous relationship with Lu Zhu. Otherwise, Lu Zhu wouldn’t have specially looked for Senior Sister and asked her to treat the child of Qiao Nian’s friend when she was catching a plane and going on a long trip.”

“And now, Qiao Nian is still seducing you. She is playing a song you’ve never made public. Moreover, you’ve kept the score away. How did she get your score? I think she’s just a lewd woman. She’s involved with many men. You’re just one of them. She doesn’t take you seriously at all.”

Lu Nian stood there calmly, frowning slightly. Previously, he was told that Big Brother’s attitude towards Qiao Nian was very ambiguous.

Moreover, Big Brother had previously said that he would not ruin Second Brother’s family.

Lu Nian’s gaze gradually became firm. He looked at Su Sheng in disdain and said, “It’s her business if she has the ability to attract so many men. What has it got to do with you?”

When Su Sheng heard Lu Nian’s words, she was about to suffocate. Her heart skipped a beat. She had never expected Mr. Dong Hua, who she thought was very intelligent, to say such ridiculous things.

If Mr. Dong Hua was an old man, she could still accept that he was senile.

But Mr. Dong Hua was a young and handsome man. How could he say such a thing?

Would a man give up everything for the person he liked?

Even if he had to become one of that woman’s many men?

What kind of ability did Qiao Nian have to toy with so many young and handsome men?

Su Sheng’s eyes gradually turned red. She was extremely jealous of Qiao Nian. If she had the ability, she would have been with Mr. Dong Hua long ago.

Su Sheng’s gaze gradually fell on Qiao Nian’s face, the anger in his eyes obvious. If looks could kill, Qiao Nian might have died a million times over.

At this moment, Qiao Nian crossed her arms and stood there calmly. She looked at Su Sheng indifferently, like a high and mighty person looking at a weak and helpless ant. She only needed to move her toes slightly to crush that ant to death.

Su Sheng’s heart turned cold. She felt ashamed.

Qiao Nian had hidden herself too well. From the beginning, Qiao Nian had treated her as a joke.

“You b*tch. What kind of sorcery did you use to make so many men like you?!” Su Sheng questioned angrily.

When Lu Nian heard Su Sheng’s voice, his expression darkened. He couldn’t tolerate anyone bullying Qiao Nian.

In his opinion, Qiao Nian was the best girl in this world.

“Sister Gu Qing, please drag her out. I don’t want to see her again.” Lu Nian frowned and suppressed the anger in his chest. He paused for a moment and continued, “I don’t want to see her in An City again!”

The reason why he was willing to talk to Su Sheng previously was entirely because Su Sheng had been brought here by Gu Qing. He was only doing it for Gu Qing’s sake.

However, Su Sheng had crossed his bottom line. He could not tolerate it.

Lu Nian’s words frightened Su Sheng so much that her legs went weak. She looked at Lu Nian in fear, not understanding why he had said this.

At this moment, Su Sheng began to doubt her worldview.

Qiao Nian was clearly the one who had done something wrong, and Qiao Nian was clearly the one who had cheated on many people. In the end, she was the one who was hurt.

She was a fan of Mr. Dong Hua. She had always loved Mr. Dong Hua deeply. How could Mr. Dong Hua trample on her love and crush it?

Mr. Dong Hua didn’t like her but he should find a good girl to be with. Not Qiao Nian.

Su Sheng’s mind was in a mess. She thought of how Lu Nian was going to chase her out of this city.
