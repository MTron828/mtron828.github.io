Chapter 431: Fight

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Previously, Song Yue had thought that as long as she appeared and the jadeite she had chosen ranked first, she should be able to make Qiao Nian and Lu Zhu’s jadeite prices lag behind. She would make Lu Zhu regret chasing her away for Qiao Nian.

However, Song Yue really hadn’t expected that Qiao Nian would really know how to gamble on stones, and that Lu Zhu’s ability wasn’t bad either.

She had only gotten third place with the help of the Gambling King.

However, the value of the jadeite she had opened was far lower than that of Qiao Nian’s.

A dark look flashed across Song Yue’s eyes. She was indignant. Why was Qiao Nian so lucky? In the next round, she would definitely trample on her.

In third place was Song Yue’s imperial green jade, which was worth 865 million.

Fourth place was Qiao Yu’s blood jade, which was worth 400 million.

Song Yue glanced at the rankings. The top four rankings had already exceeded three billion, and the last one was only 600,000.

The difference was simply too great.

In this competition, some people instantly became worth hundreds of millions, while others went bankrupt.

No matter what, HH Group was still the one making money.

Moreover, if this competition was reported, everyone would think that HH Group was able to get imperial jades.

If they could get more profits in the future, it would be even better.

......

The host picked up the microphone and said in a sweet voice, “The first match has ended. Everyone, please return to your respective hotels to rest. At three in the afternoon, please come here on time for the second round!”

After this competition ended, some people were happy, while others were sad. There were even some who could no longer take the blow and were carried out on stretchers by the organizers’ medical staff.

This was how stone gambling worked. Nine out of ten people lost.

Gao Hong looked at the piece of material in her hand and was stunned. She really couldn’t accept that she had spent millions, but in the end, she hadn’t even gotten a single piece of jade. She had lost everything.

Gao Hong’s eyes turned redder and redder, and she threw the material in her hand to the ground. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Why was this happening?

The piece of material she had bought had already been opened. Moreover, she had also seen that it was clearly filled with ice jade. Why was there only normal jade inside?

Normal jade was just a cheap thing.

Seeing that his daughter was angry, Gao Quan quickly walked over to comfort her. He said softly, “Alright, don’t be angry anymore. Daddy’s bet has increased this time, and he’s ranked thirteenth. Come with me in the afternoon, and we’ll choose a new raw stone. I believe we’ll definitely be able to get imperial jade today!”

Qiao Nian was a little close to Gao Hong and happened to hear what the father and daughter of the Gao family had said. Her lips curled into a mocking smile!

They spent millions on untrimmed quarry stones, but received jade worth tens of thousands of yuan.

It wasn’t a matter of losing money.

Instead, it was a huge humiliation in the stone gambling world.

Qiao Nian could understand how devastated Gao Hong was.

Sensing the gazes of the others, Gao Hong looked at those who were filled with concern. Finally, her gaze landed on Qiao Nian’s face. She questioned angrily, “Why are you laughing? Why are you looking at me? Are you crazy?!”

Qiao Nian couldn’t be bothered with Gao Hong.

Standing at the side, Ah Rao said happily, “You’re just a retard. Can’t we laugh?”

“You!” Gao Hong’s face turned green with anger, and tears welled up in her eyes. “You’re courting death!”

Ah Rao gently moved his shoulders and slowly unbuttoned his shirt. He licked his lips slightly and said, “Alright, now that the competition is over, I should stretch my muscles!”

When Gao Quan recalled what had happened previously, he was about to settle the score with Ah Rao with a furious expression, but he did not expect him to bring it up first!

Hence, without another word, Gao Quan clenched his fists and punched Ah Rao’s face.
