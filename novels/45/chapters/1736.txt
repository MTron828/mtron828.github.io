Chapter 1737 - 1737 Strangers

He was not a fool. How could he fight Chen Qing one-on-one when he still had bullets?

When the guards heard Wright’s words, they were relieved.

Chen Qing stood in front of the wall, his eyes growing colder and colder. He had long memorized the topographic map of Mark’s entire manor. He had never expected to run here just now and be blocked!

He looked at Wright, who was getting closer and closer. He could clearly see the madness and ridicule in his eyes.

“Chen Qing, you’re so capable. Why don’t we give this gun a try!” Wright looked at Chen Qing arrogantly and fired a shot at him.

The bullet pierced through the air and flew towards Chen Qing.

Chen Qing dodged quickly. The path was about six meters long. Wright stood in the middle and did not go forward.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The bullet pierced through the air and flew towards Chen Qing.

He frowned and looked at Wright not far away with a complicated expression.

On the other side.

Lina quickly walked downstairs with Via. As she heard the gunshots get further and further away, she said anxiously, “I suspect that Wright’s target isn’t us at all. He wants to use me to lure Chen Qing out!”

Lina hurriedly ran in the direction of the gunshot, her forehead covered in sweat.

Seeing how anxious Lina was, Via quickly chased after her. She was very worried about Lina’s injuries and said anxiously, “Seventh Princess, slow down. Don’t worry. I think the President will be here soon. Then, Mr. Chen will be safe.”

Lina ran in front. She didn’t turn back at all. Her eyes were red with anxiety as she said, “This won’t do. The palace is more than an hour away. Even if Father rushes over, it’ll be more than an hour later. I wonder if Chen Qing can last that long.”

When Via heard Lina’s words, she couldn’t help but frown. She thought to herself that even if she rushed over now, she wouldn’t be able to save Mr. Chen. After all, Wright was like a mad dog, biting anyone he caught.

Via knew very well that no matter what she said, the princess would ignore her.

Lina’s mind was filled with images of those guards aiming guns at Chen Qing. She quickly ran towards the gunshots, holding back her tears. She prayed that nothing would happen to Chen Qing.

Wright aimed the gun at Chen Qing and pulled the trigger without hesitation, firing wildly at him.

The sound of bullets exploded like fireworks.

Chen Qing’s nerves were tense as he tried hard to avoid every bullet.

He didn’t know how long he could last, but he knew very well that as long as he relaxed, all that awaited him was death.

Wright finished firing the gun in his hand, then threw it to a guard at the side. The guard hurriedly changed it to a fully loaded gun for Wright.

Wright continued firing.

At this moment, Wright was suddenly bumped into by the guard beside him. He looked at the person beside him impatiently. Just as he was about to speak, he saw that the guard’s shoulder was injured.

Wright frowned. Strange, he hadn’t even fired at the guard. How could the guard be injured?

Bang!

Gunfire came from behind.

The guard beside Wright fell to the ground.

Wright looked at the guard on the ground impatiently. What a disappointment. No one could hand him a new gun anymore. He still wanted to play with Chen Qing. If this continued, he wouldn’t be able to play with him anymore.

He turned around and saw a group of guards rushing in, each holding a gun to his guards’ heads.

Wright frowned slightly. The clothes those guards were wearing were very strange. They did not look like the orthodox army of Europe at all. They were wearing gray clothes, and all of them exuded a powerful aura, making no one dare to approach them.

Wright narrowed his eyes slightly and looked at those people with a complicated expression.
