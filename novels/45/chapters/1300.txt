1301 Trusted Person

Qiao Nian took off the work pass from Cui Yong and removed the photo that was pasted on it, revealing the photo below. She said calmly, “Do you see clearly? This is the real Doctor Wen Song. I wonder how Doctor Wen Song is doing now. Shouldn’t you go and look for Doctor Wen Song?”

Allen blinked in confusion, but he quickly came back to his senses. He was so frightened that he broke out in a cold sweat. He immediately bent down and apologized to Qiao Nian. “Miss Qiao, I’m sorry. I misunderstood just now. What about this person?”

“Arrest him. Perhaps you can get what you want from him.” Qiao Nian looked at the man lying on the ground, her expression turning even more serious.

When the Interpol officers dragged Cui Yong out, Qiao Nian saw that there was still half a bottle of medicine left and took out the IV bottle.

It seemed that those people had already infiltrated the hospital. She was worried about anyone around her now.

At this moment, Qiao Nian’s phone rang. She took it out and looked at it before putting the phone to her ear.

“Second Young Madam, I’ve already settled Little Master down. Fourth Young Master Lu is taking care of Little Master. I’ll be at the hospital soon.”

Chen Qing’s anxious voice came through the cell phone. Hearing Chen Qing’s voice, Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. At this moment, the only person she could trust was Chen Qing.

“Yes, come up quickly. I’m going to prepare medicine for him.” Qiao Nian looked at the pale Gu Zhou on the bed, her eyes filled with worry.

After Qiao Nian hung up, she stayed by Gu Zhou’s bed.

She had always slept lightly. When she heard the door open, she woke up. She wanted to get up directly, but when she opened her eyes slightly, she saw that person acting suspiciously.

That person was relatively tall and was a little different from Doctor Wen Song.

She had never expected that person to want to inject Gu Zhou with other medicine.

She had to investigate what medicine he was injecting into Gu Zhou later.

Chen Qing rushed back anxiously. This time, he was stopped outside by Interpol.

Qiao Nian walked to the door of the ward, opened it, and explained, “The two of you, he’s my husband’s secretary. You can let him in.”

Only then did the Interpol let Chen Qing in. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on Chen Qing’s face. Seeing that Chen Qing’s forehead was covered in sweat, she knew that he had run over. She said in a low voice, “Just now, a fake doctor came in and wanted to inject Gu Zhou with something else. This means that those people have already chased after us.”

Chen Qing’s expression changed drastically. He asked anxiously, “Is Second Young Master alright?”

“It’s fine. I’ve removed the needle.” At this point, Qiao Nian sighed sadly. “However, I have to go to the medicinal room to prepare medicine for him now. I’m worried about trusting other people.”

Qiao Nian nodded slightly and patted Chen Qing’s shoulder. Then, she walked out.

The pharmacy was not far from the ward. The nurse on night duty was the nurse who had followed her into the surgery previously. She greeted her and prepared the medicine herself.

After preparing the medicine, Qiao Nian returned to the ward and gave Gu Zhou another IV.

Seeing that Gu Zhou had started the IV drip again, Chen Qing said, “Looks like tonight won’t be peaceful.”

“Get more people to stand guard. I think Fourth Brother will definitely be able to protect Xiao Bao.” Qiao Nian felt that she couldn’t just rely on those international police officers. She had to rely on them.

“Okay.” As Chen Qing spoke, he took out his phone to assign tasks to his men.

…

At Mr. Chen’s villa.

Dao Wen, Zhao Song, and Chang Feng stood in Mr. Chen’s study, fully armed.

Mr. Chen sat calmly in his office chair, as usual. His gaze swept across the three people’s faces. His eyes were serious, and his voice was cold. “This mission is very important. You have to help Mr. Cui’s men kill the target, Gu Zhou!”

“Yes!” the three of them said in unison.

Mr. Chen waved at them, indicating for them to leave.

When the three of them came out of Mr. Chen’s study, Chang Feng glanced at the other two. “I’ll go get the medical supplies. Wait for me.”
