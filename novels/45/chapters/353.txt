Chapter 354: Jealousy

At the thought of this, Qin Lu’s voice became much sweeter. “Sister Jiang Yue, the gown you’re wearing is so beautiful. I heard that Matriarch Gu made all your gowns for you. No wonder this gown is so beautiful!”

When Jiang Yue heard Qin Lu’s words, a trace of displeasure flashed in her eyes, but she quickly regained her composure.

Ever since she had stolen Qiao Nian’s gown, Grandma had stopped making gowns for her. She rejected her by saying she wasn’t feeling well.

Actually, she knew very well that Grandma was unwilling to help her make the gowns because she was disappointed in her. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Jiang Yue still smiled at Qin Lu and said, “Grandma isn’t in good health. I don’t want her to work hard, so I bought this gown myself.”

When Qin Lu heard Jiang Yue’s words, she smiled and praised her. “Sister Jiang Yue, you’re really filial. Your standards of appreciation are really good. You look really beautiful in this gown. Only you can wear such a beautiful gown!”

When Jiang Yue heard Qin Lu’s words, she only smiled gently.

How could she not understand what Qin Lu meant? Qin Lu was just using her as a tool to deal with Qiao Nian.

Jiang Yue turned her head and saw Qiao Nian and Lu Nian walking side by side. The two of them were chatting and laughing, as if they had been friends for decades.

Jiang Yue clenched her right fist involuntarily, and her breathing grew heavier.

She knew very well that since she was young, Brother Lu Nian had never liked her. She had always thought that Brother Lu Nian didn’t like women, just like Brother Gu Zhou.

These two men, who didn’t like women, had both lost their principles in front of Qiao Nian.

Jiang Yue pursed her lips. She wanted to know how it felt to be favored by them.

......

Jiang Yue lowered her head slightly, hiding her thoughts. After a while, she looked up at Qin Lu and asked with a smile, “Qin Lu, what does your cousin usually do?”

Hearing Jiang Yue’s words, Qin Lu couldn’t help but smile.

Look, here was her chance.

“Cousin likes to drink tea and collect antiques. He also likes cats and dogs. He has three dogs and a cat at home. He is very outstanding and still single!”

Jiang Yue’s gaze fell on Li Kun’s back. She knew why Li Kun was single.

Ever since the blind date, Li Kun’s heart was already set on Qiao Nian.

Moreover, Li Kun had been asking around about Qiao Nian recently. It was precisely because of this that Li Kun had become good friends with her.

Speaking of which, she had Qiao Nian to thank for this.

Jiang Yue turned to look at Qin Lu and asked, “Do you like tea?”

Qin Lu hated tea the most. She usually liked to drink soft drinks, but she didn’t understand the hobby of those in high society to drink tea. However, she couldn’t reject it. She could only smile and say, “I like it!”

Jiang Yue smiled and said, “I just got some tea. I’ll get someone to bring it to you later!”

“Thank you, Sister Jiang Yue. You’re the best!”

Jiang Yue smiled and said nothing more.

Qin Lu was thinking that the tea leaves Jiang Yue had given her must be good tea leaves. When the time came, she would give the tea leaves to Auntie. Perhaps Auntie would help her pay respects to her ancestors.

Qin Lu had never known who her father was since she was born. Her mother had raised her alone, so her greatest wish was for her mother’s family to acknowledge her.

At the thought of this, the smile on Qin Lu’s face grew brighter. She had already forgotten that Qiao Nian had hit her just now.

Qiao Nian could vaguely sense that Li Kun had been looking at her. His gaze was very gentle. She turned her head and gave Li Kun a light and polite smile.

Qin Dong noticed his son’s gaze and smiled. He asked softly, “Which family’s daughter is she from? I’ve never seen her before. If you’re interested in her, I’ll go and propose marriage another day.”

“The second daughter of the Qiao family.”

Qin Dong thought for a moment and asked in confusion, “The Qiao family? Qiao Yu’s younger sister?”

In the eyes of the big families in An City, the Qiao family was nothing. The only thing that people remembered was that the Qiao family had a smart and capable newcomer, Qiao Yu.
