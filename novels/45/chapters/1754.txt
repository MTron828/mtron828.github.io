Chapter 1755 - 1755 Guilt

Mark’s words were like a bolt of lightning that hit Lina’s head. Lina was shocked.

The incident from many years ago came back to her like a tide. It clung to her like a demon, wanting to drag her to hell.

Her expression became uglier and uglier, as if the person lying on the hospital bed was not her sister, but her.

The air was getting thinner. She was about to suffocate.

Mark saw that Lina’s face was pale and she could not even say a harsh word. He sneered. He did not expect her to be that useless little girl.

He put away the smile on his face and said calmly, “Lock her in the guest room. I’m going to see her father tomorrow.”

Thinking of what was going to happen tomorrow, Mark’s lips curled up involuntarily.

Two guards escorted Lina out. When the other guards saw the corpse in the room, they asked carefully, “What about Madam Song’s corpse?”

Mark looked indifferently at the corpse on the ground. “Dispose of it.”

Song Ling was already dead. Mark had no interest in a corpse, nor was he in the mood to investigate who had killed Song Ling.

For Mark, Song Ling’s death was a perfect opportunity because he had a chance to kill his disobedient brother.

Lina had been arrested, and Mark’s men were still looking for Lina’s accomplices.

At this moment, Qiao Nian and Chen Qing were already brought to Gu Zhou by Lin Mian’s men.

As soon as Qiao Nian entered, she saw Gu Zhou sitting there in a suit and leather shoes, as if he had no intention of sleeping.

Seeing Qiao Nian’s listless expression, Gu Zhou frowned. Before he could speak, Lin Mian said, “Mark’s men have already caught up. I’m going to lure them away now.”

“You’ve worked hard.” Gu Zhou nodded slightly at Lin Mian.

As soon as he finished speaking, Lin Mian had already left the hotel with his men.

Chen Qing stood at the side and lowered his head in silence.

Qiao Nian frowned. Seeing Gu Zhou standing in front of her, she hugged him and buried her head in his chest.

“What happened?” Gu Zhou asked softly.

Qiao Nian looked up from his arms, her eyes red. She said softly, “Mark has set a trap. We…”𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

She remembered the situation and felt extremely sad. “Mark caught Lina.”

Gu Zhou looked at Chen Qing, who was not far away. Chen Qing’s face was dark, and the veins on his forehead bulged ferociously.

Gu Zhou frowned. The two of them were in a daze. If Lin Mian hadn’t stopped them, they would have rushed in.

He looked down at Qiao Nian in his arms and said in a cold voice, “It’s fine. Don’t worry. Mark won’t attack the Seventh Princess. We have to follow our previous plan. I don’t think Mark will sleep tonight.”

Qiao Nian’s voice was muffled, and her eyes were filled with guilt and self-reproach. “I originally thought that I would be caught with her, but I didn’t expect Lina to push me out in the end. She stayed alone in the room.”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he looked at her in confusion.

In his opinion, no matter how many people were caught by Mark, it wouldn’t affect their plan. Why did Nian Nian have to harp on the fact that she hadn’t been caught?

Qiao Nian pursed her lips and said sadly, “Lina is very afraid of Mark. If I accompany Lina, her condition will definitely be much better. I can even protect her.”

Gu Zhou frowned slightly and asked in a low voice, “Has Mark hurt Lina before?”

Qiao Nian shook her head and was about to speak when she seemed to have thought of something. She saw the open door and said in a low voice, “Chen Qing, you can come in too. Close the door.”

When the three of them sat on the sofa, Qiao Nian told them about how Lina had seen Mark kill her sister with her own eyes.

Towards the end, the self-reproach on Qiao Nian’s face became even more obvious. She said sadly, “I should have accompanied her. I shouldn’t have let her face the worst nightmare in her heart.”
