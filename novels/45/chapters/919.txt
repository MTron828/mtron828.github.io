At ten o’clock at night, Qiao Xin drove a purplish-red sports car to the entrance of the bar. She got out of the car elegantly and looked up at the plaque of the bar, her lips curving up in a mocking smile.

The service staff hurriedly ran over, took the car keys from Qiao Xin, and hurriedly went to park the car.

Tonight, Qiao Xin was wearing a silver tank top and short skirt. Her black hair fell over her shoulders like silk. In her silver high heels, she walked in.

Qiao Xin’s appearance instantly attracted the attention of many people, making her the center of attention in the bar.

Qiao Xin enjoyed this feeling very much. She felt that she was the chosen one. She had a good background and was outstanding. She should stand at the top of the world.

However, Qiao Xin had just taken a few steps when she realized that everyone’s attention had shifted away.

“Oh my god, that young lady is so beautiful!”

“How can there be such a beautiful woman in this world?”

“Don’t tell me she’s someone who walked out of a painting!”

…

Qiao Xin’s expression changed slightly. Who had stolen her thunder?

She turned around and saw a woman in a long black dress and a short red cloak standing at the entrance of the bar.

The black and red contrast was eye-catching. Her slightly exposed collarbone carried a bewitching beauty. Her long black curly hair draped over her shoulders like seaweed. There was no expression on her cold face, and she exuded a lazy aura.

This person was none other than Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian’s appearance made the others in the bar pale in comparison. She was like a star on the stage, dazzling and eye-catching.

Qiao Xin clenched her fists.

Qiao Nian!

It was Qiao Nian again!

Every time, it was Qiao Nian who stole her limelight!

When the rich young master, who had been drinking at the side, saw Qiao Nian, his eyes widened. He picked up his wine glass and walked up to Qiao Nian with a smile.

However, when the beauty glanced at him lazily, he clearly saw the coldness in her eyes. For some reason, he felt a chill run down his spine and instantly cowered. He no longer dared to chat with the beauty and left with his tail between his legs.

Qiao Nian arrived at the door of the private room she had booked.

She pushed the door open and walked in. When she saw that Qiao Xin was already inside, she was slightly stunned.

She didn’t expect Qiao Xin to arrive so early this time.

Qiao Xin looked up at Qiao Nian and saw her curvaceous figure and charming face.

If Qiao Nian was just a stupid beauty, she would definitely admire a good-looking person like Qiao Nian.

But Qiao Nian was too smart. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

This was what she couldn’t stand.

Why was Qiao Nian so smart and good-looking? How could the heavens be so unfair?

However, Qiao Xin quickly calmed down.

After all, Qiao Nian’s reputation would definitely be ruined tonight. She would trample on Qiao Nian and make her unable to recover for the rest of her life.

Qiao Xin pursed her lips slightly and gave a faint smile. “Sister, didn’t you say that you were going to give me a gift? Why didn’t you bring anything?”

Qiao Nian looked down at Qiao Xin. She especially admired Qiao Xin’s thick skin. She had clearly fallen out with the Qiao family. She had caused Qiao Shan to go to prison, and Qiao Shan and Su Xue’s marriage had broken down.

She had done so much, but Qiao Xin could still call her sister without any qualms. It seemed that Qiao Xin was getting more and more scheming.

“There’s no hurry about the gift. I have a few questions for you,” Qiao Nian said coldly.

Qiao Xin smiled crookedly and nodded. “Okay!”

“What did you do to me the night I lost my virginity?” Qiao Nian’s eyes turned cold.

When Qiao Xin heard Qiao Nian’s question, her expression didn’t change at all. Puzzled, she said, “Sister, why did you suddenly think of this? It’s been so long. There’s no need to bring up the past!”

“Confess. I advise you to think carefully before answering my question!” Qiao Nian smiled coldly.

Qiao Xin’s expression turned serious. She hurriedly said, “Actually, I only secretly drugged you that night. I didn’t do the rest. Of course, you should be the one who knows everything!”

At that time, Qiao Xin had sent an old man to Qiao Nian’s room, but when she brought the old man to Qiao Nian’s room, Qiao Nian had already disappeared.
