Chapter 422: Fool

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“This woman is really crazy.”

“I think she’s just a fool?”

“She’s treating stone gambling as a joke now.”

“Is there something wrong with her eyes? What good stuff can that ordinary stone produce?”

“She’s simply daydreaming.”

“In my opinion, she only has 200 yuan. That’s why she bought that stone and pretended to be rich!”

… .

Qiao Nian completely ignored their doubts. She took out two hundred yuan from her wallet and handed it to the cutter.

After the cutter checked the money, he put it into his bag and placed the raw material that Qiao Nian had bought in front of the cutter.

When some people saw that Qiao Nian was about to open the stone, they immediately lost interest and dispersed.

This was because they did not want to waste their time on a little girl. Furthermore, they still had to choose their own raw stones.

Of course, there were some who had already chosen theirs. They hugged their stones, wanting to wait until the end to cut them open.

Of course, there were also some people standing beside Qiao Nian, waiting to see her make a fool of herself.

......

The cutting master’s gaze landed on Qiao Nian’s face. He asked, “Do you want to cut it at the end, or now?”

“Now,” Qiao Nian said calmly.

The cutter glanced at Qiao Nian, and a trace of sympathy flashed across his heart. This cute little girl would probably be mocked to death by these upper-class people in the future.

The cutting master called his disciple, Zhang Yong, over and handed the stone to him. “Cut it well!”

Zhang Yong was already very familiar with cutting. He drew lines on the raw stone, thinking that he would find a suitable spot to cut it later.

Gao Hong had been standing by the side the entire time. She was waiting to see Qiao Nian make a fool of herself. She sneered, “As the saying goes, if you don’t listen to your elders, you’ll suffer. The cutting master has already advised you so, but you still chose this raw stone! That’s right. You’re so poor. Of course, you can’t afford good raw stones!”

Qiao Nian’s gaze landed on the raw stone in Gao Hong’s hand. A green color had already seeped out. It looked like good material. According to the market, this stone should be worth more than a million yuan.

Qiao Nian snorted coldly and said, “You’d better mind your own business!”

Gao Hong hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to still be so stubborn. She glared at Qiao Nian, wishing she could just kill her.

She was a proud daughter of the heavens. When had she ever suffered such humiliation?

This time, she would never let Qiao Nian leave this place alive.

At this moment, Zhang Yong was about to start cutting.

Qiao Nian frowned and hurriedly shouted, “No, you can’t cut it like this!”

Zhang Yong stopped what he was doing and frowned slightly. He explained patiently, “Normally, we cut this material like this.”

Qiao Nian’s eyes turned cold. She asked, “If all of this is top-grade jade, can you afford to compensate me?” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

When Zhang Yong heard Qiao Nian’s words, he couldn’t help but laugh. He weighed the stone in his hand and said, “Miss, I’ve seen many such stones. There’s no jade in here at all!”

When the surrounding people heard what Zhang Yong said, they all laughed.

“I knew it. She doesn’t know anything about stone gambling at all!”

“He has already drawn the lines. She doesn’t even know how to gamble on stones but she even wants to command the master to cut it!”

“If I didn’t know better, I would have thought that there was imperial jade inside. If it’s really imperial jade, I wouldn’t hesitate to swallow this stone!”

“Did she read too many novels? She came out to embarrass herself!”

“That’s most likely the case. She really thinks she’s an expert in stone gambling!”

“A novel is a novel after all. She’s just fooling people. She’s the only one who takes it seriously.”

… .

Qiao Nian ignored the voices of those people. She frowned, and all eyes were on this raw stone.
