Chapter 306: The Truth

Impossible! This was absolutely impossible!

How could Qiao Nian know about this?

The voice on the radio continued to speak.

“Sister Xia Xue, why aren’t you saying anything? We grew up together and have such a good relationship. Don’t hide it from me. What exactly is going on? Don’t worry, I won’t betray you. I’ll help you forever!”

When the others heard Gao Lin’s words, they were all instantly touched. They thought to themselves that Gao Lin and Xia Xue were really close.

Hence, everyone quietened down to listen.

Xia Xue’s face grew paler and paler, and her body trembled in fear. She didn’t dare to listen any longer. She ran up to Qiao Nian and said, “Qiao Nian, what exactly are you doing? What must I do for you to stop?!”

“The truth.” Qiao Nian looked at Xia Xue intently and shrugged. “I just want everyone to know the truth. I’ve already given you a chance, but you didn’t cherish it. Don’t blame me for being impolite!”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Xia Xue knew that Qiao Nian had no intention of stopping.

The broadcast continued.

At this moment, Xia Xue’s hesitant voice came through the radio. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Actually, actually… I’m not the person Brother Cao is looking for!”

When they heard Xia Xue’s words, everyone in the school was stunned.

They looked at Xia Xue in disbelief. Yesterday, when they heard that Xia Xue was going to be Mr. Dong Hua’s female musician, they immediately treated Xia Xue as their goddess.

But they had never expected their goddess to be a liar.

Xia Xue was now sitting limply on the ground. Her face was pale, her eyes were red, and her hair was in a mess. She looked extremely disheveled.

The voice on the radio continued.

Xia Xue felt as if she had been placed on a frying pan.

“How… how did this happen?”

“Actually, that afternoon, when I passed by the training room, I heard the pleasant sound of violin music coming from inside. At that time, I thought that some teacher was practicing in there, so I wanted to go over to greet him and ask for guidance.”

“As you know, violin is the last thing I’m good at. When I entered the classroom, the person inside had already left. At that time, I wanted to be inspired and try to practice the violin. However, when I took it out, I was still uneasy, so I started playing the piano in the practice room.”

“I had just played one song when the cleaning lady came in. I no longer had any intention of playing the piano, so I left directly. Later on, I found out that Brother Cao had been staying inside. He came out to ask the cleaning lady for help, and she told Brother Cao that I was the one practicing.”

“Did Brother Cao misunderstand that you were the violinist?” Gao Lin asked.

“Yes.”

Gao Lin’s sharp intake of breath could be heard over the radio.

“So, the person who was practicing the violin in the training room was Qiao Nian? Qiao Nian is the person Brother Cao is looking for?”

“It’s very likely her. Moreover, the violin tune she played in front of Brother Cao is almost identical to the one I heard at the training room door that day. I don’t know if Brother Cao will recognize this sound. If he knows that the person playing the violin is Qiao Nian, then all my hard work will have been in vain.”

“That’s right. We must not let Qiao Nian know. Otherwise, she will replace you as Mr. Dong Hua’s female musician!” Gao Lin’s voice was firm.

Xia Xue’s voice was a little flustered. “Then… then what should we do now?”

“Actually, this matter isn’t that difficult. Mr. Dong Hua’s concert will be held soon. As long as we don’t let Brother Cao meet Qiao Nian during this period, the matter will be resolved,” Gao Lin said wittily.

“Yes, you’re right. I was the one who got the chance first. This position should have been mine. Moreover, Qiao Nian is a country bumpkin. She hasn’t received any professional training. How can she be qualified to be Mr. Dong Hua’s female musician? She’s not worthy of standing by Mr. Dong Hua’s side either. Only I am worthy of standing by Mr. Dong Hua’s side and becoming the center of attention!”
