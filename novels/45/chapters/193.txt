Chapter 194: I Want to Make a Report!

Qiao Yu calmly walked up to the police officer. With a gentlemanly smile on his face, he said, “Officer, I’m Qiao Yu, Qiao Shan’s eldest son. If you have any questions, you can ask me.”

The police knew the Qiao family well, given that they were a well-known family in An City. Hence, the officer asked, “What exactly happened?”

The smile on Qiao Yu’s face didn’t change. He continued, “Actually, this was all a misunderstanding. My younger sister didn’t know that my parents had already gotten a divorce. When she saw my mother and her boyfriend coming here, she thought that my mother had cheated on her husband. In a fit of anger, she called the police. I’m very sorry for making you officers come here for nothing. This is our fault!”

When the police officer heard Qiao Yu’s words, he was slightly stunned. He frowned. “They’re divorced?”

Qiao Yu smiled and nodded, handing the divorce certificates to the police.

The police officer glanced at Qiao Yu in confusion, then at Su Xue and Qiu Nan before opening the folder.

So Qiao Shan and Su Xue had already divorced a long time ago. The officer knew very well that in order not to cause their children worry, many parents still lived together even after getting a divorce. They would pretend that they were still together.

The police officer closed the folder and handed the divorce certificates to Qiao Yu. With a serious expression, he reprimanded, “So that’s how it is. If the parents have already divorced, the children should be told, especially since they’re no longer young. If not, there might be misunderstandings in the future!”

Qiao Yu said humbly, “I’m sorry, Officer. We were in the wrong. I’ll get my assistant to follow you to the police station to make a statement. We’ll definitely cooperate with you.”

Qiao Yu’s attitude was commendable. He admitted their mistake without hesitation. His actions were straightforward, and the officer couldn’t find any fault with him.

“Wait a minute.” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Gu Zhou, who had been standing silently in the corner, stood up straight. He took a step forward, exuding a cold aura that made one shiver.

The police officer looked over. When he saw Gu Zhou, he was stunned. He had not expected such an otherworldly man to ever exist in real life. He looked like a god from heaven.

Even him, a straight man, felt that Gu Zhou was handsome.

The officer had seen photos of Gu Zhou before, but he felt that the photos did not capture a fraction of Gu Zhou’s elegance and aura.

“Mr. Gu, is there anything else?” The police officer asked politely.

“I want to make a police report!”

Gu Zhou’s voice was not loud, but it frightened everyone present. Everyone in the Qiao family felt their hearts jump to their throats.

Qiao Xin’s expression changed. She looked at Gu Zhou worriedly.

Qiao Yu’s brow furrowed imperceptibly, but he quickly regained his composure.

Gu Zhou’s cold eyes swept indifferently across Su Xue, who was standing at the side. Finally, his gaze fell on Qiu Nan, who was still curled up in the corner.

The police officer looked at Gu Zhou in confusion.

Gu Zhou stood there, sunlight casting him in a warm glow. He seemed to sparkle in the sunlight.

Gu Zhou walked towards the police officer step by step, his voice low and hoarse. “Since Qiao Shan and Su Xue have already divorced, Qiao Shan has nothing to do with Su Xue. I just saw Qiao Shan beat up Su Xue and her boyfriend, Qiu Nan, with my own eyes. This is a crime of intentional injury!”

Qiao Shan, who had walked to the door of the room, was stunned. He stopped in his tracks and turned to look at Gu Zhou in disbelief.

Was Gu Zhou mad? He was clearly the victim, but Gu Zhou was actually making a police report in favor of Su Xue!

Qiao Shan clenched his fists tightly. If looks could kill, Gu Zhou would have died long ago.

As for Su Xue, she was stunned. She looked at Gu Zhou in confusion.

When the officer heard Gu Zhou’s words, he turned to look at Su Xue. His gaze lingered on her face.

Su Xue’s hair was in a mess, and her face was already swollen. Her nose was still bleeding.

The police officer’s gaze fell on Qiu Nan again. Qiu Nan was no better off than Su Xue. One of his eyes was swollen so badly that he couldn’t open it.
