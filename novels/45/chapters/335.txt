Chapter 336: Care For Him

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Qi’s words, she was slightly stunned. Did a four-year-old child not want to improve just because he was using WeChat?

In school, it was normal for teachers to confiscate phones, but for a teacher to delete a WeChat contact without permission? What was going on?

“Then which kindergarten are you in?”

“An City Kindergarten.”

When Qiao Nian heard the name of the school, her eyes turned cold. This kindergarten was the most famous elite school in An City.

The fact that Gu Qi could go to this school proved that Gu Qi’s parents were very capable.

Moreover, most four-year-olds went to kindergarten to play. They would cultivate a lively and cheerful personality so that they could integrate into groups as soon as possible.

Even if children were to play games on WeChat, in the eyes of the teachers, they would only fully develop their hands-on abilities. How did it become that they didn’t want to improve?

“Then when can you return the money you owe me?”

“Tomorrow will be fine!”

“Then I’ll look for you at your kindergarten tomorrow morning, okay?”

“Alright.”

Qiao Nian closed the chat window with Gu Qi, then opened Qin Chuan’s WeChat and sent a voice message.

......

“What time did you arrange for the charity auction?”

“Ten in the morning.”

“Set the auction for tonight!”

Qin Chuan replied very quickly. “This won’t do. The notice has already been sent. If we delay it now, many people won’t be able to keep up with their schedules. If they don’t come, the losses will be huge!”

Qiao Nian frowned. If it was just a small matter, she would have relented. But for some reason, she felt that Gu Qi’s matter was a big deal to her.

Whenever she thought about how that young child, Gu Qi, had been bullied by a teacher in school, she would feel faintly uneasy.

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian sent a voice message. “Do you want us to calculate how much of a loss it will be for me if you bring the charity auction forward by a month?”

After a minute, Qin Chuan reluctantly sent a voice message. “Alright, let’s change it to eight o’clock tomorrow night.”

Qiao Nian closed WeChat and narrowed her beautiful fox-like eyes. She had to meet Gu Qi’s teacher tomorrow and see what kind of mentality he had.

At this moment, her phone rang. It was a message from Wang Xuan.

Qiao Nian opened it and gasped.

“Nian Nian, Gao Lin is dead!”

Qiao Nian frowned. This news was a little sudden. She hurriedly typed, “What’s going on?”

“Ye Ran was the one who killed her. Ye Ran had been waiting at the entrance of the stadium for you but ran into Gao Lin instead. Hence, she and a group of hooligans dragged Gao Lin to a small alley and killed her without hesitation. When she killed Gao Lin, she even called your name!”

Qiao Nian understood now. “Did Gao Lin help me fend off the disaster?”

“You can’t say that. From what Ye Ran said, not only does she want to kill you, but she also wants to kill Gao Lin. However, she bumped into Gao Lin first. Looks like Ye Ran won’t have a good time in the future.”

Qiao Nian smiled coldly. Wang Xuan was indeed clear-headed.

Qiao Nian changed the topic and said, “It’s getting late. You should rest early.”

“Will you be affected by this?” Wang Xuan asked worriedly.

“This is the sin of the two of them, and they will still be punished by the law. The two of them will have nothing to do with me. How can I be affected by them?”

“That’s true. Then go to bed early. Goodnight!”

…

The next day, Qiao Nian went to An City Kindergarten at half past nine.

This timing was just right for Gu Qi to arrive at school. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Moreover, last night, she had already hacked into the kindergarten’s security system in advance and wrote her information in Gu Qi’s parent’s information.
