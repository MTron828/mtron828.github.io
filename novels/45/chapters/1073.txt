Su Xue instantly felt a headache coming on. She sighed helplessly, then shook her head and said seriously, “She won’t listen to anything I say!”

“How is that possible? She’s your daughter. How can she not listen to you? She used to listen to you, didn’t she?” Shen Hao was anxious. What if his wife was beaten to death?

Su Xue said truthfully, “Actually, I’m not Qiao Nian’s biological mother, and I have no right to care about her. She won’t listen to me at all.”

Shen Hao’s eyes widened. He felt as if he was hallucinating. Qiao Nian wasn’t Su Xue’s daughter. Back then, when Su Xue had sent Qiao Nian to his house, she had even given him some living expenses!

!!

He was a little surprised that such a stingy person like Su Xue would really adopt a daughter.

No matter how badly Su Xue treated Qiao Nian, she was still Qiao Nian’s adoptive mother. Qiao Nian should listen to Su Xue. “Sister Su Xue, according to what you said, you spent money to raise Qiao Nian. You’re her adoptive mother. She’ll definitely listen to you!”

Su Xue felt a headache coming on. She had already made it so clear. Why couldn’t Shen Hao understand?

Su Xue sighed helplessly and said truthfully, “She won’t listen to me. Her husband is the richest and most powerful person in An City. Our family doesn’t dare to provoke him either! You two are actually not afraid of anything and even want to get into trouble. There’s nothing I can do!”

Shen Hao was stunned. In the past, he had heard from others that rich and powerful people had always been bold. Would his wife die here today?

Before Shen Hao could recover from his shock, he saw Gu Zhou walking towards him step by step.

His heart jumped to his throat, and his body tensed up nervously. It was as if a mountain was pressing down on him, suffocating him and almost suffocating him!

Gu Zhou stood in front of Shen Hao with an indifferent expression. He looked down at Shen Hao and said coldly, “Are you saying that my wife seduced you?”

Gu Zhou’s words frightened Shen Hao so much that cold sweat broke out on his forehead. His legs trembled as he stood rooted to the ground.

Shen Hao was also a man, so he naturally knew what Qiao Nian’s man meant by this question.

This was digging up old scores!

Shen Hao was so frightened that he was drenched in sweat. He raised his hand to wipe the sweat off his forehead, thinking about how to speak!

Shen Hao was so frightened that he was drenched in sweat. He raised his hand to wipe the sweat off his forehead, thinking about how to speak!

That meant that Qiao Nian was very likely to be bullied!

At the thought that Qiao Nian had almost been bullied, Gu Zhou clenched his fists tightly in the pocket of his suit pants.

Although Gu Zhou was so angry that he wanted to kill someone, he still looked calm and composed.

Shen Hao did not dare to look into Gu Zhou’s eyes at all. His gaze drifted everywhere, and he was conflicted about how to speak!

Gu Zhou stood in front of Shen Hao the entire time. Suddenly, his eyes were filled with killing intent, and his voice grew colder. “I’ll give you one last chance to tell the truth!”

Shen Hao shuddered as if he had been electrocuted. His lips trembled. Would he die a horrible death if he told the truth?

But if he lied, wouldn’t he die a worse death than telling the truth?

Shen Hao didn’t dare to lie. After all, Qiao Nian was still here.

Shen Hao looked at Qiao Nian, who was standing at the side. Qiao Nian was leaning against a tree, looking lazily at the surrounding scenery. She didn’t even look at him.

Qiao Nian, that wretched girl. He had raised Qiao Nian up, but not only had he not received any favors from her, but he was also almost frightened to death by her husband!

If he had known that Qiao Nian was such a heartless person, he wouldn’t have raised her back then. He should have let her fend for herself!

Of course, Shen Hao only thought about these things in his heart, but he did not dare to say them out loud!

Shen Hao’s mind raced. If the young ladies in their village were bullied, they would never dare to tell anyone else. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Everyone would subconsciously think that it was the girl who was indecent and wanted to seduce men. She would lose her innocence!

Without her innocence, a young lady would not have a good reputation. She would not be able to marry into a good family in the future.
