863 Suicide?

Qiao Nian knew that Gu Zhou was comforting her. She said, “On the way to the hospital just now, I’ve already used silver needles to help Xiao Shi vomit. I think she’ll be fine. We’ll guard her outside!”

At this moment, hurried footsteps came from afar in the corridor.

Song Man jogged over.

Previously, Gu Zhou had driven Qiao Nian and Xiao Shi to the hospital first. He had ignored Song Man and she had taken a taxi over.

!!

Song Man’s hair was in a mess, and her face was flushed red from the intense running. Just as she was about to ask about Xiao Shi, she saw Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian holding hands tightly.

Song Man bit her lower lip, her eyes red. However, Xiao Shi’s safety was the most important thing now. She hurriedly asked, “How is Xiao Shi now? What did the doctor say?”

As soon as she finished speaking, she received a sharp look from Gu Zhou.

Song Man’s eyes instantly turned red. She had been worried that Qiao Nian had misdiagnosed her. This hospital visit was arranged by Gu Zhou. The people in the hospital wouldn’t cooperate with Qiao Nian to fake the truth. She guessed that she had indeed taken a lot of sleeping pills.

At the thought of this, Song Man lowered her gaze guiltily and said, “It’s all my fault for what happened today. In the morning, I realized that Xiao Shi didn’t look too good. I asked her, but she didn’t speak. If I had enlightened her earlier, she might not have taken too many pills!”

Qiao Nian had been very worried about Xiao Shi. When she heard Song Man’s words, she was so angry that she laughed. She retorted angrily, “Didn’t you give her the sleeping pills? Did she give them to herself? Did she commit suicide by taking sleeping pills? What does such a young child know?”

With that, Qiao Nian’s expression changed slightly.

Gu Qi and his two children were different from ordinary children. They were much smarter than ordinary children.

Xiao Shi really committed suicide by taking sleeping pills?

That was absolutely impossible!

She would rather believe that Xiao Shi had accidentally taken the wrong medicine than believe that she had committed suicide on purpose.

Xiao Shi was just a child. She had yet to see the entire world. Why would she want to commit suicide?

Unless she was really desperate.

Why? Qiao Nian couldn’t understand.

When Song Man heard Qiao Nian’s words, her heart ached even more. Her eyelashes were wet with tears. “How could I have done such a thing to Xiao Shi? She’s the person closest to me, and she’s been by my side through the most difficult times. She’s everything to me!”

When Gu Zhou, who had been standing silently at the side, heard Song Man’s words, he said coldly, “If anything happens to her, I’ll let you know what it means to have even more difficult times!”

His voice was like thousand-year-old ice, bone-chilling.

Song Man’s tears fell uncontrollably, and her voice choked. “You’ve gone too far. She’s my daughter!”

“Is she really your daughter? If she is, how can you bear to let her do so much work?”

Song Man’s frown deepened. She explained unhappily, “Why do you always look at me with prejudice? I have no choice. I can’t do anything well with one hand. Xiao Shi is a good child. She cares about me a lot because I can’t do things well. She’s always helped me do it. As a mother, how can I bear to let my child be hurt? You’re the father of the child. Can you bear to hurt your child?”

“Whether you’re the biological mother of the child is still up for debate!” Gu Zhou said coldly. He didn’t want to look at Song Man at all. He turned to look at Qiao Nian. “Have you brought the blood you just drew?”

“It’s in my pocket!”

Gu Zhou nodded, then took out his phone and made a call. “I’m at the entrance of the emergency room of the gastric lavage room in the hospital. Come over now and do a DNA paternity test. I want the results now!”

When Song Man heard Gu Zhou’s words, she frowned and pursed her lips, her eyes filled with sadness. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Soon, Gu Zhou hung up.

Song Man looked at Gu Zhou in despair and asked, “Do you really not believe me?”

Gu Zhou did not even look at Song Man. He kept staring at the emergency room door.
