1385 Stay Behind First

“Yes, yes.” Song Yu nodded and said, “I’ll change to an old phone later. That way, there won’t be a problem.”

When Qiao Nian heard Song Yu’s words, she couldn’t help but laugh. “Actually, it’s not that exaggerated. Some people eavesdrop on apps. Anyway, it’s fine if you don’t usually have your phone. If you change your cell phone, those people will know that you already know. They might attack you.”

When Song Yu heard Qiao Nian’s words, her expression changed slightly. Then, she nodded and said, “Then I won’t make a move. I don’t usually use my phone anyway.”

Lu Nian looked at Song Yu with a complicated expression and quickly looked away.

At this moment, the lights in the operating theater turned off, the door opened, and the doctor walked out.

Lu Qi hurriedly stood up, her heart beating violently, as if it would jump out of her chest the next moment. She quickly walked over.

Qiao Nian followed closely behind, and Song Yu followed.

Lu Qi asked worriedly, “Doctor, is he fine?”

The doctor took off his mask and met Lu Qi’s anxious gaze. He said, “Don’t worry, the patient is already fine. Fortunately, he was sent here early. If he had been any later, I’m afraid even a god wouldn’t have been able to save him.”

Lu Qi’s tense heart finally settled back down. Her lips curved up sweetly.

Song Yu held Lu Qi’s arm and her gaze fell on her face. Her lips curved up slightly.

The doctor said solemnly, “The patient’s health is fine, but he needs to recuperate. Don’t let him get injured again, or there will be endless trouble!”

“Yes, I’ll remember.” Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. “We’ll definitely pay special attention. We won’t let him get hurt again.”

The doctor continued, “The patient’s condition is a little special now. It’s best if he’s hospitalized for observation. He can only leave after some time. You can go through the hospitalization procedures now.”

A nurse walked out and handed a form to the doctor. The doctor wrote and drew on the form before handing it out. “Who’s the patient’s family member?”

“I am.”

“I…” Lu Qi had just finished speaking when Qiao Nian spoke first. Her eyes darkened slightly, and she felt a little disappointed. She didn’t understand why she had such a strange feeling. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Qiao Nian handed the form to Chen Qing. Chen Qing smiled at the nurse. “Nurse Su, can I trouble you to take me to pay the fee?”

The name tag on the nurse’s chest said her name. When she heard Chen Qing’s words, she smiled and said, “Please come this way!”

Chen Qing and the nurse left.

After a while, the doctors and nurses pushed a bed out. Qin Chuan was lying on the bed.

Qin Chuan’s face was pale. He lay there, still wearing an oxygen mask. His breathing was very light.

Lu Qi looked at Qin Chuan’s face and recalled how Qin Chuan had rushed up to protect her in his arms when the tunnel collapsed. Her eyes couldn’t help but turn red again.

Senior, I hope you can recover soon.

She wondered if she would be able to repay what she owed him in this life.

Seeing that Lu Qi was sad again, Qiao Nian reached out and patted her back. She said gently, “Qi Qi, it’s fine. Qin Chuan is fine. Don’t worry. You’re too weak now. You need to rest well.”

Song Yu looked at Lu Qi’s pale face and said in agreement, “Qi Qi, you really should rest well. What if Mr. Qin wakes up and you faint?”

Lu Qi shook her head in disapproval and said, “I’m much better now. I’m fine. I just want to stay by his side. When he wakes up, I want to thank him in person.”

Qiao Nian looked at Lu Qi and recalled the first time she had seen her. This child looked gentle, but she was indeed stubborn. She smiled and nodded.

Lu Zhu glanced at Lu Qi, then at Qiao Nian and said, “Sugar, stay here and accompany Mr. Qin and Qi Qi. Ah Nian and I will go home and see if there are any new clues.”

“Okay,” Qiao Nian agreed obediently.

Lu Zhu’s gaze landed on Song Yu’s face and he said, “Xiao Yu, stay behind first.”
