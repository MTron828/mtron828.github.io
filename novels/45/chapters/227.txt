Chapter 228: The Violin

Ye Ran lowered her gaze and said thoughtfully, “At that time, I only caught a glimpse of his back. He looked very young. By the way, I remember that Mr. Donghua is only his stage name. His surname seems to be Lu. I don’t know the details.”

The surrounding people instantly became excited. One by one, they looked at Ye Ran with glowing eyes. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Young? Exactly how young?”

“Yes, Sister Ran, tell us!”

Ye Ran shook her head gently and said, “I’m not sure about the details either, and I can’t make things up. However, I’ll tell you when I meet him in person!”

Disappointment flashed in the eyes of the students around Ye Ran. However, they were still looking forward to Ye Ran telling them about Mr. Donghua after she returned from the concert.

“Alright, Sister Ran. You have to take a closer look. Tell us everything when you get back.”

“I’m so envious!”

Qiao Nian felt a wave of annoyance. She couldn’t listen to their flattery any longer. She stood up.

Wang Xuan looked at Qiao Nian in confusion. “Where are you planning to go?”

Qiao Nian had just arrived at the school, and wasn’t very clear of the rules. She took the opportunity to ask Wang Xuan, “I’m an official student of the school now, right?”

Wang Xuan nodded.

“Then, am I allowed to visit the instrument room?”

“Of course. As long as there are no teachers using it, you can use it anytime.”

“Thank you.” Qiao Nian left the classroom and walked towards the instrument room, flexing her fingers as she went.

Playing that piece just now had triggered an urge to immerse herself in more music. She had seen many instruments in the room just now, and wanted to take the opportunity to try them out.

Before Qiao Nian came to school, she had already researched some details.

There were more than thirty instrument rooms in the school. Each instrument room had a different set of instruments. Glancing at the floor plan of the school on her phone, Qiao Nian sought out the farthest instrument room from her classroom.

The music academy was so huge that it took her more than half an hour to get there.

Qiao Nian had just pushed the door open when she caught her first glimpse of the resplendent interior. Just like the instrument room from before, there were all kinds of instruments here.

The place was empty. There was no one there.

What Qiao Nian didn’t notice was that in the corner next to the piano, a man was lying lazily on the sofa, basking in the sun. From time to time, he would stroke his prayer beads.

The moment Qiao Nian entered the instrument room, her gaze fell on the violin right in the middle of the room. She walked over.

After picking up the violin, she adjusted her posture and drew the bow across the strings a few times. The pitch was perfect. With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian closed her eyes and began to play the violin by instinct.

“Yearning”.

This was an interlude composed by the composer, Mr. Huadong, for the opera Anna. The female lead, Anna, was trapped in an abyss, but she yearned for the clear blue sky.

As a meditative piece meant for the violin, the emotions it expressed were deep yet distant. Amidst the serene, undulating melody, its elegance was intriguing.

After the piece ended, Qiao Nian was still immersed in it. She opened her eyes and looked into the distance, her lips curving up involuntarily.

This was where the enchantment of music lay. With just one piece, one’s mood could change completely.

Qiao Nian glanced at the time. There were still more than forty minutes until the next lesson. She had to go back now.

Qiao Nian had just left the instrument room when a young girl with a graceful figure walked in. She sized up all the instruments in the room, and her gaze finally fell on the lute.

She sat down next to the lute and began to play an elegant tune.

Just as she was about to continue playing, she saw a cleaning lady enter.

Seeing that it was getting late and that she had to rush to class, she quickly walked out.

Not long after she left, the man who had been sitting by the piano walked out. He looked at the retreating figure of the young girl from afar, and his lips curved up slightly.

Although her skills with the lute were average, her violin skills were outstanding. At her age, she could be considered a musical genius.
