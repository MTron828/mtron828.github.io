Lu Zhu frowned slightly.

Jiang Cheng…

Without taking her eyes off Jiang Chi, Qiao Nian said firmly, “I came here this time to see Lu Zhu take him away. I only lied to you about this. However, I didn’t lie to you at all just now. I can swear to the heavens. Besides, I believe that his hands won’t be stained with the blood of Jiang Cheng!”

Jiang Chi laughed, but his eyes were filled with desolation.

It seemed that the more beautiful a woman was, the better she was at lying.

Such people could not be trusted at all.

If she said these words in front of Jiang Cheng, he would definitely not let her see Lu Zhu. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Jiang Chi, I can swear that I will definitely investigate the cause of Jiang Cheng’s death. This time, I won’t lie to you again. Please believe me one last time!”

Jiang Chi stood there, staring at Qiao Nian intently, his throat moving.

“What makes you think I’ll let you go?”

Qiao Nian smiled. She glanced at the mercenaries standing around her and said, “You don’t have to let me go. At most, we’ll all die together. Actually, thinking about it, with so many people dying with me, it’ll be quite lively on the road to hell, right?”

Jiang Chi clenched his fists in his pockets. His voice was cold. “You’re threatening me now.”

Qiao Nian nodded calmly and said seriously, “It’s true that I’m threatening you, but I really want to investigate the cause of Jiang Cheng’s death! If you don’t believe me, why don’t we go to Jiang Cheng on the way to hell and ask for an explanation?”

Jiang Wen, who was standing at the side, was stunned. This was the first time he had seen a woman threaten Master Jiang so unscrupulously.

Moreover, Jiang Wen could tell from Qiao Nian’s eyes that she wasn’t afraid of death at all.

Jiang Chi lowered his eyes and said in a hoarse voice, “He’s just your foster brother!”

“But he was willing to give up his life to save me!” Qiao Nian looked at Jiang Chi calmly.

Was there a problem with giving up everything to save his savior?

A cold smile appeared on Jiang Chi’s face as he said, “In that case, let’s all go to hell to find my brother!”

When everyone heard Jiang Chi’s words, they were all shocked.

Qiao Nian just stood there calmly. She knew that Jiang Chi was playing a game with her. Jiang Chi would definitely be willing to part with these mercenaries, but he would definitely not be willing to let Jiang Cheng’s corpse suffer any harm.

Just as the two sides were in a deadlock, a loud bang suddenly came from outside.

Kaboom –

Jiang Chi narrowed his eyes slightly, his gaze turning cold.

This voice was earth-shattering!

Qiao Nian was also stunned. She could feel the ground shaking.

A mercenary ran in from outside in a panic. His gaze accidentally landed on the nuclear bomb on Qiao Nian’s waist, and he almost fainted from shock.

“What happened?”

The mercenary swallowed nervously and said, “Oh no, Gu Zhou has surrounded the entire ghost city with tanks!”

The mercenary looked at Jiang Chi’s expression and said carefully, “He has only hit the east side of the ghost city. It looks like there are ten tanks. He even said that if he doesn’t see Qiao Nian and Lu Zhu in ten minutes, he’ll fire directly at the palace!”

Jiang Wen was speechless.

Jiang Chi had been calm when facing Qiao Nian, but now that he heard the mercenary say this, his expression changed.

Jiang Chi asked uncertainly, “Are you talking about the Gu family in An City?”

“Right!”

“The second young master of the Gu family?” Jiang Chi asked, unwilling to give up.

“It’s him!”

At this moment, Qiao Nian was also shocked.

Where did Gu Zhou get so many tanks from?

A bright light flashed across Qiao Nian’s eyes, and the corners of her mouth curled up slightly. Her originally uneasy heart calmed down a lot.

Qiao Nian didn’t know when she had changed, but Jiang Chi could see it clearly.

Jiang Chi was suddenly curious about who Qiao Nian was.

For Qiao Nian, Qin Chuan would not hesitate to fall out with him!
