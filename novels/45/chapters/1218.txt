1219 Madness

Jiang Yue smiled and blinked. She said gently, “Yes, Yue’er will never leave you.”

Boss Jin looked at Jiang Yue, who was in his arms. She was only in her twenties, but he was almost fifty. He was more than twenty years older than Jiang Yue. Even if the two of them could live to eighty, he would still leave more than twenty years before Jiang Yue.

In the past, Boss Jin didn’t care about his age at all. He felt that the older a man got, the more charming he became, but now, he was still a little flustered.

Boss Jin looked at Jiang Yue in front of him sadly and said in a low voice, “Yue’er, I’m more than twenty years older than you now. I’ll definitely leave you first in the future.”

If he died, he would never see Jiang Yue again.

!!

At the thought of this, Boss Jin instantly became emotional, his eyes filled with gloom. He grabbed Jiang Yue’s neck and pushed her onto the sofa, as if he wanted to kill her. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“As long as you die with me, we can be together forever!” Boss Jin said crazily.

Hearing Boss Jin’s crazy words, Jiang Yue shivered in her heart. She closed her eyes, not daring to reveal the fear in them.

Jiang Yue nodded instinctively, as if she had agreed with Boss Jin.

Initially, she wanted to comfort Boss Jin, but he kept strangling her. She couldn’t say a word.

Boss Jin looked at Jiang Yue’s unafraid expression. Seeing Jiang Yue nod, the uneasiness in his heart instantly dissipated.

When his rationality returned, Boss Jin looked at Jiang Yue’s pale face. He was so frightened that he hurriedly let go.

Jiang Yue slowly opened her eyes, which were covered in a layer of mist again. It made one’s heart ache.

Coughing violently, she curled into a ball.

Seeing how uncomfortable Jiang Yue was, Boss Jin hurriedly smoothed her back and said guiltily, “Hey, I’m sorry. It was all my fault just now. I was too agitated. Did I hurt you? Do you want to go to the hospital now?”

Jiang Yue breathed in the hard-won fresh air. She looked at Boss Jin with teary eyes and shook her head in understanding. She said gently, “I’m fine now. It doesn’t hurt anymore!”

Hearing Jiang Yue’s words, Boss Jin felt even more guilty.

“My dear Yue’er, it’s all my fault just now. I swear I won’t hurt you again.” Boss Jin looked at the understanding Jiang Yue and pulled her into his arms, muttering an apology. “I’m sorry, I’m really sorry!”

Jiang Yue let Boss Jin hug her. She slowly lowered her gaze, her eyes filled with hatred and ruthlessness.

She hated these days with Boss Jin. She felt like a cheap plaything.

This damned fat pig really had ideas of his own. He actually wanted her to die with him. Why didn’t he look in the mirror to see what he looked like? Where did he get the guts to make such a shameless request?

However, Jiang Yue still looked like she was fine. Her voice was teary as she said, “I’m really fine. You don’t have to worry about me.”

When Boss Jin heard Jiang Yue’s words, his heart instantly softened. He let go of Jiang Yue, took a tissue from the side, and carefully wiped the tears off her face.

How could he meet such a gentle person like Jiang Yue?

After being in the business world for so many years, he was used to seeing people scheme against each other. This was the first time he had seen such a gentle and kind person.

Boss Jin’s heart was filled with guilt. He began to promise, “Be good, baby. Don’t worry, I won’t let you die with me. You still have your life to walk. When I’m old, I’ll make a will. If I die, you’ll inherit all my assets.”

Jiang Yue didn’t expect Boss Jin to say such a thing. She hurriedly said coquettishly, “I don’t want you to grow old! I just want you to accompany me forever!”

Jiang Yue’s words pleased Boss Jin. This was the first time Boss Jin had seen such a silly girl. He smiled and said, “It’s human nature to die. After I leave, if you have money, you should be able to live a stable life. I won’t have to worry about you anymore.”

When Jiang Yue heard Boss Jin’s words, her eyes instantly turned red. She held Boss Jin’s hand tightly and asked in shock, “Don’t say that. You’ll definitely live to be a hundred years old.”
