1462 Ridiculous

The President narrowed his eyes slightly, his long eyelashes hiding the deep thoughts in them. He seemed to be still considering what Gu Zhou had just said, but he did not put down the gun in his hand.

Seeing the President like this, Gu Zhou’s expression was calm. He naturally knew what the President was thinking.

Even though he was facing the gun, Gu Zhou still said calmly, “If you shoot now, I’m afraid the Seventh Princess will die with me. Why don’t you wait patiently? When the time comes, let the Seventh Princess explain all of this to you herself.”

The secretary beside the president frowned. His eyes darted around as he said disapprovingly, “President, this person is too bold. Not only did he kidnap the Seventh Princess, but he also dared to stand in front of you arrogantly. He was just certain that you would make a compromise for the Seventh Princess. Perhaps his accomplices have already secretly moved her somewhere else!”

When Chen Qing, who was standing beside Gu Zhou, heard his secretary’s words, he sneered and said, “The President is here, and this place is also surrounded by your people. Do you think we’ll move the Seventh Princess somewhere else? Are you looking down on the strength of your European army and the President?”

“You… you’re spouting nonsense!” The president’s secretary’s face turned red with anger. He pointed at Chen Qing’s face and said angrily, “You’re clearly stalling for time. If you really want to return the Seventh Princess to us, you can return her to us now. Why do you still have to wait ten hours?”

When Chen Qing heard the secretary’s words, he raised his eyebrows slightly. “If we want to use the Seventh Princess, we can take her as a hostage now. Why do we have to wait ten hours? What exactly are you trying to do by sowing discord here?”

When the president’s secretary heard Chen Qing’s words, he was stunned. Just as he was about to reprimand Chen Qing, he heard Gu Zhou say, “I can let the president meet someone first!” As Gu Zhou spoke, he gave Chen Qing a look.

Chen Qing immediately understood. He hurriedly took out his phone and sent a message. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The President frowned slightly. His gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face and he asked, “Who do you want me to see?”

“Someone you trust very much!” Gu Zhou said calmly.

A minute later, a doctor pushed a wheelchair out of the hospital building.

The person sitting in the wheelchair was David, who had been personally sent by the president to be Lina’s chauffeur and bodyguard.

The doctor pushed David in front of the president, then stood quietly to the side.

“President!” When David saw the President, his eyes couldn’t help but turn red. He said guiltily, “It’s all my fault. I couldn’t protect the Seventh Princess well. Please punish me, President!”

The president slowly lowered the gun in his hand. His gaze fell on David’s face and he asked, “I asked you to protect Lina. Why was Lina injured?”

Just as David was about to speak, the president’s secretary hurriedly said, “President, don’t believe David. David might have betrayed us. He must be Gu Zhou’s man now!”

When David heard the president’s secretary say this, his expression changed drastically. He said loudly, “President, my loyalty to Princess Lina is obvious. I’m from Europe. I won’t betray my president and princess!”

The president’s secretary sneered and questioned, “You make it sound so nice. You’re as injured as the Seventh Princess, but you’re still speaking up for Gu Zhou. Why don’t you let the Seventh Princess come out and explain everything?”

“President, the Seventh Princess’s current situation…”

However, before David could finish speaking, he was interrupted by the president’s secretary.

“David, you keep saying that you’ll give up everything for the Seventh Princess. Why is the Seventh Princess still injured? The princess trusted you so much and asked you to be responsible for her safety. What did you do?”

“I want to protect the Seventh Princess too, but when we were on the mountain today…” David explained, his face pale. However, before he could finish speaking, he was interrupted by the secretary again.
