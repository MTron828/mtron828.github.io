Chapter 684: Breaking the Rules

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Zhou Zhou was really breaking the rules. If she didn’t have any composure, she would have eaten him up long ago.

Qiao Nian took a step back. Her face was a little red, and her breathing was rapid. She couldn’t stare at Zhou Zhou anymore, or Gu Zhou would be the only one injured.

“Um, why don’t you…”

Before Qiao Nian could finish speaking, she heard Zhou Zhou ask in confusion, “Nian Nian, did you just…”

“Shut up!” Qiao Nian hurriedly interrupted Zhou Zhou, feeling a little vexed. How could she have done such a thing to Zhou Zhou? She looked up at Zhou Zhou and inadvertently met his innocent and ignorant gaze, feeling a wave of guilt.

She was too evil.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips tightly. As if she had thought of something, she pointed at the bathtub and said, “Alright, go in and take a shower!”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Zhou Zhou nodded and walked towards the bathtub, getting into it. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Qiao Nian took a deep breath. She finally understood why the CEO always kissed the female lead forcefully in overbearing novels. It turned out that he was seduced by beauty. That was why he couldn’t help but…

“Nian Nian, you have to help me take a shower.”

Zhou Zhou’s puzzled voice came from the bathtub.

Qiao Nian took a deep breath and tried her best to be mentally prepared. She would definitely not have any improper thoughts about Zhou Zhou again.

After helping Zhou Zhou take a shower, she could sleep!

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian turned around and saw Zhou Zhou sitting in the bathtub.

The water in the bathtub was extremely clear. She could clearly see Zhou Zhou’s model-like figure.

There were still some water droplets hanging from his sexy collarbone. Those crystal clear water droplets were like beautiful poppies that were captivating.

Zhou Zhou took the shower gel from the side and squeezed it into the bathtub.

Instantly, the bathroom was filled with the fragrance of shower gel.

Zhou Zhou casually stirred the water, and it was immediately filled with bubb;es.

The fragrant shower gel instantly filled Qiao Nian’s nose. Qiao Nian was in a daze. She stood rooted to the ground in a daze, staring at Zhou Zhou.

Zhou Zhou tilted his head and looked at Qiao Nian, his eyes filled with confusion. He blinked and asked obediently, “Nian Nian, aren’t you going to help Zhou Zhou take a shower?”

Qiao Nian used enough self-control to look away. Panting heavily, she said, “Turn around!”

“Oh.”

Qiao Nian heard the sound of water again. Thinking that Zhou Zhou’s back was already facing her, she looked at him.

When she saw Zhou Zhou’s three-dimensional profile, she gasped.

In the past, she had always thought that his face was good-looking, but now it seemed that she was wrong.

Gu Zhou’s side profile was even more alluring than his face.

Qiao Nian felt that she was like a female hooligan. She was a little afraid that she wouldn’t be able to help but force herself on him!

“Turn around!” Qiao Nian slowly closed her eyes and took a deep breath, trying hard to suppress the heat in her heart.

However, she felt her heart beating faster and faster.

Pursing her lips, she had a strange feeling. She opened her eyes and tried to regain her composure.

Every time she touched Zhou Zhou, her self-control could not help but break down.

Qiao Nian walked over to the bathtub and wiped Gu Zhou’s back with a towel.

Her gaze inadvertently fell on the scar on his back, and she suddenly recalled her time in MY.

At that time, Gu Zhou was injured, but he couldn’t be bothered to rest. He brought the tank to save her.

Her lips curved up involuntarily.

She thought of Jiang Chi and pursed her lips slightly. After returning to An City, she had sent Jiang Chi a message.

She had made it clear to Jiang Chi that she would give him an answer at the end of the month.

Actually, she wanted to ask her brother directly, but every time she saw him, she couldn’t ask him directly.

She wanted to ask Chen Shi, who was beside her brother, out. When the time came, she would ask Chen Shi if he knew about what happened back then.

It would be best if Chen Shi knew.

“Nian Nian.”

A soft voice sounded from the side.

Qiao Nian suddenly retracted her thoughts. Only then did she notice that it was Zhou Zhou speaking. She asked casually, “Yes?”

“Just now…”

When she heard Zhou Zhou say “just now”, Qiao Nian’s face turned red again.
