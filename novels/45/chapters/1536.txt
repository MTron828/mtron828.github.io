1537 You are important

After Lina left, Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou were left alone in the room.

The smile on Qiao Nian’s face gradually spread. She really liked people like Gu Zhou. No matter what it was, he could speak directly. She didn’t have to guess.

She liked every true word he said. Those words showed his love for her, allowing her to feel how much he cared about her.

Qiao Nian let go slightly and interlocked her fingers with his. She looked up at Gu Zhou and her heart softened. She said gently, “Yes, bring Chen Qing with you!”

Lina insisted on going up the mountain with her. She was afraid that she wouldn’t be able to take care of Lina in time. When that happened, Chen Qing could help take care of Lina.

Gu Zhou nodded.

“Then I’ll look at the map again. We can’t go to every place. Let’s find the most likely place!”

“Okay.”

Qiao Nian naturally let go of Gu Zhou’s hand and walked to the map, staring at it seriously.

Gu Zhou turned around and walked towards the room, a trace of killing intent flashing in his deep eyes.

Last time, if he had accompanied Qiao Nian up the mountain, Qiao Nian wouldn’t have been attacked by Wright at Bear Mountain.

Fortunately, Wright wasn’t a lunatic. If he was…

Gu Zhou did not dare to think about that possibility at all.

Now the president and Mark had basically declared war head-on. Mark was eyeing the palace covetously. They would probably be followed by Mark’s men as soon as they left the palace.

This situation was even more dangerous. It was impossible for him to put Qiao Nian in danger. He had to accompany her and protect her.

Gu Zhou sent Chen Qing a message, instructing him to arrange for someone to follow them.

Soon, Gu Zhou received a reply from Chen Qing.

“Okay, Second Young Master!”

Gu Zhou walked to the closet. It was filled with brand new clothes and he had changed into casual clothes.

He walked back to the living room and saw Qiao Nian marking the map again with a serious expression.

Qiao Nian smiled and nodded. “Yes, I plan to go to Cliff Mountain, but before that, I have to give Madam President a routine treatment.”

Qiao Nian nodded and took out her phone. She typed, “The medicine involved isn’t enough for all the plastic surgery. If these are all the records of Madam President, it means that she really didn’t undergo plastic surgery. If the president hid a portion of the cases, it indirectly means that the president doesn’t want news of Madam President undergoing plastic surgery to spread.”

She showed it to Gu Zhou, then deleted all the words she had typed.

Gu Zhou lowered his head slightly and kissed Qiao Nian’s forehead.

Qiao Nian put her phone away and looked at Gu Zhou. “It’s getting late. I’ll go change my clothes.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Qiao Nian had changed into a tracksuit, and her hair was tied up high behind her head. She looked clean and tidy. Just as she and Gu Zhou were about to leave, they saw Lina running in.

“Nian Nian, where are we going today?” Lina looked at Qiao Nian expectantly and asked impatiently.

“To Cliff Mountain.” Qiao Nian took a step forward and took Lina’s arm with a smile. Only then did she say, “But I have to visit Madam President first. We can only set off after her basic treatment.”

Lina smiled and nodded. She accompanied Qiao Nian to Madam President’s room. Shen Mei was already awake. She was sitting by the bed and reading.

“Mom, Nian Nian and I came to visit you. How do you feel today?” Lina sat by Shen Mei’s bed and sized up her face.

When Shen Mei saw Lina, she put the book aside and gave a pure and sweet smile. “Lina.”

She looked up at Qiao Nian, who was standing beside Lina, and smiled innocently. “Doctor.”
