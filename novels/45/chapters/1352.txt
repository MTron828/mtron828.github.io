1353 Second Sister-in-law?

When the three children came out of the kindergarten, Qiao Nian waved at them.

Xiao Bao and Xiao Shi were the first to run up to Qiao Nian. They each held Qiao Nian’s hand, their eyes filled with joy. Gu Qi walked over leisurely.

When the parents who had received their children saw Qiao Nian, their eyes lit up. They hurriedly led their children to discuss the engagement with Qiao Nian.

Just as Qiao Nian was about to refuse, she saw that those people were arguing with each other.

“Why are you squeezing? I came first.”

“I was clearly here first!”

“All of you, stand aside. I was here first!”

…

Qiao Nian took the opportunity to get into the car with the three children and leave, leaving the crowd of mothers behind.

Qiao Nian was in charge of driving. Xiao Shi sat in the front passenger seat, and Xiao Bao and Gu Qi sat in the back seat.

“Mommy, Li Tian from our class went to the school supermarket to buy a lot of snacks after class today. Not only did she share them with Second Brother, but she also gave Brother and me some snacks.” As Xiao Shi spoke, she turned back to look at Xiao Bao, who was sitting behind the driver’s seat. She covered her mouth and laughed. “There are also many girls who went to talk to Second Brother with red faces.”

Xiao Bao hurriedly explained, “Mommy, I’m a transfer student. They’re just welcoming me.”

When Qiao Nian heard Xiao Shi’s words, her lips curved up involuntarily. She asked with interest, “Them?”

Before Xiao Bao could speak, Xiao Shi said impatiently, “All the girls in our class. Although some of them didn’t bring food over, they kept clamoring to sleep beside Second Brother’s bed during their lunch break.

“So Xiao Bao is so popular. That’s good. Enjoy your kindergarten life.” Qiao Nian looked up at the rearview mirror and smiled at Xiao Bao.

Xiao Bao was lively and cheerful. This kind of boy was very liked by young girls.

When Xiao Bao heard Qiao Nian’s words, he smiled and nodded. “Yes, I like school the most.”

In the past, when Xiao Bao was in MY, he had always been studying alone at home. There was no companion to play with him, and he was alone every day.

Although he could live a happy life by his mommy’s side now and had many friends to play with in school, he still missed his Daddy occasionally.

“Mommy, my brothers and I are all full today. We don’t even have to eat tonight.” As Xiao Shi spoke, she gently touched her stomach, looking obedient.

Qiao Nian smiled at Xiao Shi and asked curiously, “What did you eat today?”

“Cake, potato chips, and Coke,” Xiao Shi said, counting on her fingers. She paused and smiled at Qiao Nian. “I heard that latiao is especially delicious. If it weren’t for the fact that the taste is especially strong, Li Tian would have bought latiao for Second Brother!”

When Xiao Shi mentioned “latiao”, she couldn’t help but swallow. She looked up at Qiao Nian. “Mommy, can we eat latiao once?”

In the past, her neighbor’s sister had eaten latiao in front of her. She had always wanted to eat them, but because her family was poor, she had never eaten them.

At a red light ahead, Qiao Nian slowly stopped the car and turned to look at Xiao Shi. She reached out and scratched Xiao Shi’s nose intimately. Smiling, she said, “Of course. I’ll get someone to buy latiao and send them home later.”

Qiao Nian didn’t dare to casually take the children outside. After all, she wasn’t even sure who wanted to snatch the children.

Was it someone from MY, or Europe, or the person who had kidnapped her back then?

“Mommy is amazing. Mommy loves you the most!” Xiao Shi’s face turned red with excitement. She had never expected to live such a happy life. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Nian smiled and instructed Xiao Shi to sit well in the front passenger seat. Seeing that the light had turned green, she continued driving and said, “Mommy asked the kitchen staff to prepare more desserts. When the time comes, you’ll share them with your classmates tomorrow. Good friends have to learn to share.”

“Okay!” Xiao Shi nodded in agreement. Her eyes lit up slightly, as if she had thought of something. She turned to look at Qiao Nian. “Mommy, do you already treat Li Tian as your daughter-in-law?”
