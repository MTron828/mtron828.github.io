At this moment, Annie saw the man look over.

“Ah!” Annie cried out.

At this moment, the guards came looking for her. They hurriedly surrounded her. On the surface, they were protecting her, but in reality, they just didn’t want her to wander around.

The captain of the guards walked up to Annie and said in a calm and steady voice, “Princess Annie, how are you? Why don’t I send you to the hospital?”

“To what hospital?” Annie questioned angrily, glancing at the guards surrounding her.

If this were any other time, she would have gotten impatient and sent these guards away.

But now, she could make use of these guards.

Annie panted heavily. She looked at Gu Zhou sinisterly and ordered loudly, “Arrest him!”

You can lead a horse to water but you can’t make him drink. It was fine as long as she felt good. She had to make this man kneel in front of her, beg for mercy and make him sleep with her.

Annie didn’t know Gu Zhou’s identity, but the guards all knew. One by one, they stood rooted to the ground, not moving.

Seeing that no one was going to arrest Gu Zhou, Annie’s expression darkened. Her anger surged as she questioned sternly, “How dare you disobey me? All of you will be punished by military law.”

“Princess Annie, if there’s nothing else, I’ll bring you to the living room now. The president is still waiting for you there,” the guard captain said politely.

Slap!

Without hesitation, Annie slapped the captain of the guards. Her eyes were filled with anger. She asked coldly, “Did I ask you to speak? What right do you have to criticize me?”

The captain of the guards lowered his head and said nothing.

Gu Zhou had seen everything Annie had done. His eyes were like ice as he looked at Annie coldly.

Annie was frightened by Gu Zhou’s gaze. She subconsciously wanted to hide, but when she thought about how although these guards didn’t listen to her, they would never let her be hurt.

Annie squared her shoulders and was about to speak when she heard footsteps in the distance. She turned her head and saw the president approaching.

After the President walked in, his gaze fell on Annie. Seeing that she was drenched, he narrowed his eyes. “Annie, have you already forgotten the rules of the palace? If that’s the case, I’ll specially find a teacher to teach you! Now that you’ve already become like this, someone bring her down to freshen up!”

“Uncle.” Annie didn’t take it to heart at all. Her gaze fell on the president’s face. Seeing him look over, she said, “I came to the palace this time to deliver the Falling Autumn Grass. I waited in the living room for a long time, but you didn’t come, so I could only plant the Falling Autumn Grass first. I just didn’t expect this hooligan to push me into the stream!”

The President frowned. Today, his Madam had destroyed the Falling Autumn Grass Annie had sent over previously. He had just been thinking about how to ask his brother’s family to send another pot of Falling Autumn Grass over. He did not expect Annie to take the initiative to send it over.

However, in the entire European country, only his brother knew how to cultivate Falling Autumn Grass. He wanted to import Falling Autumn Grass from overseas, but all kinds of situations would happen on the planes that transported the Falling Autumn Grass.

Later on, he thought of inviting someone from overseas to the palace to specially cultivate the Falling Autumn Grass. However, those people would always be unable to come to Europe because of various situations. Even if someone did, they would die silently in a few days!
