Chapter 341: At All Costs

Before Qin Lu could say anything, her aunt had already hung up.

Qin Lu’s face turned pale in fear. She had a bad feeling.

At this moment, her phone rang with a text message.

Qin Lu turned on her phone and saw that the school had expelled her.

What?

It was actually true?

The school had actually expelled her.

Qin Lu’s legs gave way and she collapsed to the ground.

How was this possible?

Gu Qi was just a child of a neighborhood security guard. Gu Qi’s aunt was definitely not a big shot!

Could it be that Gu Qi’s aunt wasn’t bluffing just now? Did she really know the principal, Qin Chuan?

Qin Lu looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief. She pursed her lips nervously, recalling Qiao Nian’s tone when she called Qin Chuan just now.

This woman must be very close to the principal.

Otherwise, she wouldn’t have spoken to the principal so casually.

Qin Lu’s eyes instantly turned red. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Working at this school was her only chance to get close to high society. If she left, she would never be able to enter high society again in her life.

She had to stay here!

At all costs!

Even if it meant throwing away her dignity!

Qin Lu crawled towards Qiao Nian and knelt down in front of her, apologizing with red-rimmed eyes. “Miss Gu, Miss Gu, this is really my fault. I was in the wrong, I was in the wrong. I’m really sorry! I shouldn’t have blamed Student Gu Zhou without investigating thoroughly. Only now do I know that he’s a smart child. Back then, I must have been kicked in the head by a donkey, or perhaps there was something wrong with my brain. That’s why I said those words. Miss Gu, please give me another chance, okay? Can you call Director Qin and ask him to keep me?”

Qiao Nian looked at Qin Lu’s pitiful manner and said coldly, “No!”

For someone like Qin Lu, who fawned over the rich and powerful, she did not know what was wrong at all. This was her true character. It had long been ingrained in her. It was like how a dog could not change its habit of eating shit. She believed that Qin Lu would never change.

Qin Lu apologized mainly because she knew that she couldn’t afford to offend her.

If Qin Lu had met a child from an ordinary family today, that child would have been bullied by her for every day he studied here.

How innocent were the children who were bullied?

Countless children like Gu Qi had been bullied in this school.

Qin Lu didn’t apologize because she loved her child.

Qin Lu was not worthy of being a teacher.

Qiao Nian walked towards the classroom. She opened the door and waved at Gu Qi.

When Gu Qi saw Qiao Nian, his eyes lit up. He hurriedly picked up his small school bag and ran over.

Holding Gu Qi’s hand, Qiao Nian walked out. The security guard saw that the system recognized Qiao Nian’s face, so he didn’t stop her.

Gu Qi was holding Qiao Nian’s hand. Sensing the warmth in her palm, he felt a little uncomfortable.

Gu Qi retracted his hand.

Qiao Nian looked down at Gu Qi. Seeing his cold expression, she couldn’t help but laugh.

Qiao Nian reached out to Gu Qi and said gently, “Give me your hand.”

Gu Qi frowned slightly and said, “That’s not good. Men and women shouldn’t touch each other.”

Qiao Nian was speechless.

Qiao Nian really hadn’t expected Gu Qi to know so much at such a young age.

Of course, Qiao Nian didn’t insist. Last time, Gu Qi didn’t hold her hand either. She felt that Gu Qi might not be used to touching others.

Qiao Nian brought Gu Qi to a dessert shop near the school.

They sat facing each other.

Gu Qi took out fifteen dollars from his school bag and placed it on the table. He pushed it in front of Qiao Nian, his face full of seriousness. “This is the money I owe you.”
