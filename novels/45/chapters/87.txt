Qjao Nian smiled and said shyly, “Grandma, you’re embarrassing me with your

compliments. It was a piece of cake for me to make these. Do you like this

flavor? If not, I can make you sonmething else”

The smile on Matriarch Gu’s face grew even brighter. With Qiao Nian around,

she would not have to worry much about the Gu family any longer.

“My darling girl, this tastes quite good. I like it,” Matriarch Gu said happily. The

more she looked at Qiao Nian, the more she liked her.

“You can only take three pills a day at most. Only take one when you’re feeling

unwell. After all, medicine can be harmful if not taken in moderation,”Qiao

Nian instructed carefiully.

Seeing Qjao Nian being so gentle and considerate, Matriarch Gu’s eyes welled

up with tears. Her darling granddaughter was such a good child. With her darling granddaughter by Gu Zhou’s side in the future, she no longer had to

worry about anything.

Carrying a tray of teacups, Jiang Yue walked up to Matriarch Gu.

Matriarch Gu smiled and picked upa cup from the tray, taking a sip. Then, she

smiled at Qjao Nian and said, “My darling child, Grandma, is getting old. This

is all I can do for my health. I don’t expect to live for that much longer; after

all, it’s natural for one’s health to fail at my age. I’ve already written my will.

Ahem..”

Towards the end, Matriarch Gu began to cough uncontrollably.

Jiang Yue hurriedly patted Matriarch Gu’s back and asked worriedly, “Grandma,

what’s wrong?”

Seeing Matriarch Gu like this, Zhao Qjan hurriedly stepped forward and said

anxiously, “Grandma, you..”

Before Zhao Qian could finish her sentence, Matriarch Gu spat out a mouthful

of blood.

Jiang Yue tried hard to hide her joy. She glared at Qjao Nian and questioned,

“Qjao Nian, what exactly did you give Grandma?

Immediately, everyone turned to look at Qiao Nian.

Upon hearing Jiang Yue’s words, Zhao Qjan frowned. “Sister Jíang, don’t spout

nonsense. Second Sister-in-law would never do such a thing.”

“Why not?” Jiang Yue was usually in charge of everything in the Gu family, and

Matriarch Gu had not hidden the fact that she had written her will from her,

nor the fact that Qjao Nian would inherit everything. Jiang Yue hadn’t wanted

to do anything to Matriarch Gu, but she could no longer hold back when she

thought about how she had grown up in the Gu family, but Matriarch Gu hadn’t Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

even left her a cent.

“I have absolute trust in Second Sister-in-law,” Zhao Qian said seriously. She

had seen Second Sister-in-law concocting the medicine yesterday with her

own eyes. Even if the medicine couldn’t treat Grandma’s illness, it wouldn’t

make her vomit blood. “Someone, go get a doctor.”

Zhao Qjan was the daughter of Matriarch Gu’s older brother, so she was deeply

loved by Matriarch Gu. As for Jiang Yue, she was just a girl Matriarch Gu had

adopted.

The servants were naturally more willing to listen to Zhao Qian.

At this moment, the butler arrived as well. His expression changed and he

asked in a low voice, “What’s happened to Matriarch Gu?”

Just as Zhao Qjan was about to speak, Jiang Yue spoke up first. “Butler,

Grandma only became like this after taking the medicine Qjao Nian made for

her.”

“How is this possible?” The butler exclaimed. He glanced at Qjao Nian, who was

standing at the side. Seeing Qjao Nian’s impassive expression, the butler

calmed down a little as well. “Second Young Madam, Matriarch Gu.”

Before Qiao Nian could speak, Jiang Yue spoke, her eyes red-rimmed. “Qiao

Nian, what exactly did you do to Grandma? You need to give us an explanation

right now!”

At that moment, Qjao Nian was checking Matriarch Gu’s pulse and didn’t notice

what Jiang Yue was saying at all.

Jiang Yue snatched Qiao Nian’s hand away and said in a rage, “Don’t touch

Grandma!

Seeing how fierce Jiang Yue was acting, Zhao Qian hurriedly stepped forward

and said, “Sister Jíang, what are you doing? Second Sister-in-law is treating

Grandma’s illness. Stop fooling around!”

“How am I fooling around?” Jiang Yue turned to glare at Zhao Qjan and said

furiously, “She doesn’t know how to treat illnesses at all. She’s lying to us.”

Zhao Qjan looked at Jiang Yue helplessly and said, “Sister Jiang, can you stop

spouting nonsense? Second Sister-in-law is skilled in medicine. Let Second

Sister-in-law treat Grandma first. We’ll discuss the rest later!”
