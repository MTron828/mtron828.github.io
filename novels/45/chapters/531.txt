Chapter 532: Possessiveness at Work

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Chen Qing felt that the atmosphere was a little strange now. He nodded and said, “I think so.”

“I need a very accurate answer.”

As an outsider, Chen Qing naturally saw it very clearly. When Gu Zhou asked this, he could only answer honestly, “Second Young Madam seems to be more attentive than before.”

“More??”

Chen Qing lowered his head silently, not daring to say anything else.

Gu Zhou’s Adam’s apple bobbed as he looked at Chen Qing. His eyes were filled with coldness as he said, “Go and ask Doctor Sha when Lu Zhu will be discharged.”

Chen Qing heaved a sigh of relief and quickly replied, “Yes.”

Second Young Master’s possessiveness began to act up again.

He also hoped that Mr. Lu could recover as soon as possible so that everyone could return to An City together. That way, he wouldn’t have to be on tenterhooks. Besides, Madam wouldn’t have to run from the hotel to the hospital every day to help.

Mr. Lu had saved Second Young Madam’s life. Second Young Master was also grateful to Mr. Lu. However, Mr. Lu did not know his limits and was actually so close to Second Young Madam.

After seeing Chen Qing leave, Gu Zhou walked towards Lu Zhu’s ward.

Inside the ward.

When Gu Zhou walked in, he saw Qiao Nian taking Lu Zhu’s temperature. Qiao Nian even thoughtfully took out all the medicine he was taking and arranged it properly. She even poured a cup of hot water and placed it on the table, preparing to cool it down.

His brow furrowed.

When Qiao Nian did these things, it seemed very natural, as if she had done it countless times.

He had never experienced such thoughtful care from Qiao Nian before.

In his memory, every time Qiao Nian finished his acupuncture, she couldn’t wait to leave, let alone take care of him.

Gu Zhou’s eyes gradually darkened.

Only after Lu Zhu had taken his medicine did he notice that Gu Zhou had arrived. Gu Zhou was standing at the door, staring unblinkingly at him and Sugar.

Lu Zhu raised his eyebrows slightly and raised his hand to push up the frame of his glasses. He sized Gu Zhou up carefully.

Gu Zhou’s face was the same as before, sickly pale. Although he was tall and upright, he still gave off a weak feeling. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Lu Zhu’s eyes flickered with worry.

Gu Zhou’s health was not good. If he died one day, what would happen to Sugar?

Gu Zhou walked in, wearing a well-tailored suit. He stood by Lu Zhu’s bed, his thin lips moving slightly. “Brother Zhu.”

Gu Zhou’s voice was very low, but it carried an irresistible force. Although he was calling Lu Zhu Brother, it made one feel as if he didn’t take Lu Zhu seriously at all and was still declaring his sovereignty domineeringly.

Qiao Nian was speechless.

What was going on?

She remembered that Gu Zhou did not call Lu Zhuzhu Brother in the past!

When Lu Zhu heard Gu Zhou call him that, he was slightly stunned and looked at his sister in confusion.

When he noticed the surprise in Qiao Nian’s eyes, he realized that Qiao Nian probably hadn’t told Gu Zhou about their relationship.

Qiao Nian looked away from Gu Zhou indifferently. She picked up the hot water beside her and handed it to Lu Zhu.

Gu Zhou quickly took the cup from Qiao Nian’s hand and handed it to Lu Zhu. “Brother Zhu, take your medicine!”

Lu Zhu calmly took the cup from Gu Zhou.

Although he was older than Gu Zhou, Gu Zhou had never called him that. When he saw the deep meaning in Gu Zhou’s eyes, he understood.

The corners of Lu Zhu’s mouth curled up slightly. He looked at Gu Zhou with interest and said meaningfully, “Ah Zhou, are you asking me to be your brother now?”

Gu Zhou’s lips curved into a cold smile. His voice was as low as ever, and there seemed to be a trace of warning in it. “I’ve always treated you as my brother.”
