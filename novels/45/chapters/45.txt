Chapter 46: Hercules?

Only upon hearing Zheng Xiang’s words did the men come back to their senses. Hurriedly, they stepped forward and began to pull the silver needles out of Zheng Xiang’s body one by one.

After all the silver needles were removed, Zheng Xiang regained control of his body. He sneered at Qiao Nian.

Zheng Xiang’s eyes were cold. He raised his fist and swung it viciously towards Qiao Nian’s face.

The hearts of the onlookers all began to race in fear. Some were so frightened that they hurriedly shut their eyes, unable to continue watching.

Everyone silently muttered a prayer for Qiao Nian.

However, the scream they had been anticipating did not come.

Everyone opened their eyes in unison to see what was going on, but what they saw stunned them all.

Qiao Nian was a small young lady, slender and almost weak-looking. Yet her thin hand caught hold of Zheng Xiang’s fist in an instant.

Zheng Xiang himself was stunned. He wanted to retract his hand, but Qiao Nian didn’t release her grip, preventing him from moving.

While everyone was still in a daze, Qiao Nian swiftly dislocated Zheng Xiang’s arms and kicked sharply at Zheng Xiang’s knee, forcing Zheng Xiang to fall down on his knees in front of her.

“Although it’s not the new year yet, I’ll take it that you’re here to wish me a happy new year.” Qiao Nian, who seemed to have gained several inches in height, looked down at Zheng Xiang in contempt. There was no trace of a smile on her face. “If you cause any more trouble, I’ll make sure you suffer the consequences!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

At this moment, Zheng Xiang was kneeling on the ground with shock written all over his face. His mind was filled with Qiao Nian. He couldn’t believe that Qiao Nian could counter his fist with just one hand.

How was this possible?

Who exactly was this Qiao Nian?

Zheng Xiang looked up at Qiao Nian. For some reason, he felt that Qiao Nian looked like a demon from hell, making him shiver.

Qiao Xin, who was standing in the crowd, gasped as she looked at Qiao Nian in fear. She didn’t expect Qiao Nian to be so skilled. How was she able to dodge Zheng Xiang’s attack?

Qiao Xin clenched her fists tightly. She yearned to walk towards them and help Zheng Xiang hit Qiao Nian right this instant.

However, she only dared to picture the scene, nothing more. She could only stand there and worry.

Qiao Nian slowly raised her right leg, her ten-centimeter-tall high heel grinding into Zheng Xiang’s shoulder. She leaned forward slightly and exerted a little strength with her right leg, causing Zheng Xiang to instantly turn pale.

Cold sweat broke out on Zheng Xiang’s forehead, and his veins bulged. He looked up at the woman in front of him, his eyes filled with shock and disbelief.

She was so strong!

Zheng Xiang was starting to doubt himself.

He had always thought that he was a good fighter. Now, it seemed that his skills were just average.

The onlookers almost thought that they were watching a martial arts flick. One had to know that in modern society, few people were this skilled at defense.

They sized Qiao Nian up. Qiao Nian was only 1.65 meters tall. She looked so thin and weak. How could she be so strong?

At this moment, they all had the same thought in mind. No matter who they provoked, they couldn’t afford to offend Qiao Nian.

Qiao Xin’s face was pale and beads of sweat had appeared on her nose. Her heart was beating faster and faster, as if it would jump out of her mouth at any moment.

She suddenly recalled something. If Qiao Nian had used the same amount of strength to slap her back then, would her head have separated from her body?

Some things didn’t bear thinking about. The more she thought about it, the more afraid she became.

Qiao Xin swallowed nervously.

Should she be thanking Qiao Nian for showing mercy back then?

Qiao Xin quickly dismissed the thought.

Hatred flashed in her eyes as she looked at Qiao Nian. Qiao Nian had stolen her shares and her man. How could she thank such a despicable and shameless person?

She had to quickly think of a way to get the shares back. And, she had to win Gu Zhou’s heart.

Qiao Xin’s gaze gradually shifted to Gu Zhou’s face. Looking at his handsome profile, a trace of bashfulness flashed in her eyes..
