1343 Brotherly Respect

Qiao Nian carried Xiao Bao to the sofa and sat down. She said to the servant standing not far away, “Bring over a pair of slippers that Xiao Bao can wear.”

Smelling Qiao Nian’s scent, Xiao Bao felt inexplicably at ease. He rubbed his head against Qiao Nian’s shoulder. “Mommy.”

Gu Qi and Xiao Shi, who were sitting at the side, were stunned when they saw Xiao Bao acting like a spoiled child. They also wanted their mommy to hug them like that.

“Yes.” Qiao Nian gently pinched Xiao Bao’s cheek and said with a smile, “Little man, do you want to see your great-grandmother, brother, and sister?”

When Xiao Bao heard that he was going to meet his family, most of his sleepiness dissipated. The moment he opened his eyes, he saw Gu Qi and Xiao Shi staring at him not far away.

Xiao Bao blushed. When he was at Daddy’s house, he had always wanted to see his brother and sister. Now that he was going to see them, he was a little flustered.

“Xiao Bao.” Seeing Xiao Bao looking at Gu Qi and Xiao Shi, Qiao Nian smiled and said, “This is your brother and sister, Xiao Qi and Xiao Shi.”

With that, Qiao Nian looked in another direction with Xiao Bao and said, “This is your great-grandmother. Your Daddy should have told you about her, right?”

Xiao Bao’s gaze followed Qiao Nian’s. In the end, he looked at Matriarch Gu. Looking at Matriarch Gu’s face, he obediently greeted her, “Great-grandmother.”

When Matriarch Gu heard Xiao Bao call her, her gaze became even gentler. She reached out and took Xiao Bao’s hand, saying gently, “Xiao Bao looks the most like Ah Zhou. He’s exactly the same as Ah Zhou when he was young.”

Initially, Xiao Bao was still very uneasy, but after hearing Matriarch Gu’s words, his heart instantly warmed. A long-awaited smile appeared on his face.

“Xiao Bao must be exhausted from the flight back. Go wash your hands. Let’s eat together as a family.” Matriarch Gu smiled and patted Xiao Bao’s head. Seeing how soft and cuddly he was, she couldn’t help but smile.

“Okay,” Xiao Bao replied obediently. He got off Qiao Nian and walked up to Gu Qi, who was closest to him.

Gu Qi sized Xiao Bao up carefully. Xiao Bao looked chubby and his skin was wheat-colored. He looked to be in good spirits. It seemed that Xiao Bao was doing well.

Before Gu Qi could speak, he saw Xiao Bao walk up to him.

Xiao Bao looked at the child in front of him. There was still baby fat on his face, but his pursed lips and gaze made him look very cold.

“Brother.” As Xiao Bao spoke, he walked forward and hugged Gu Qi.

This was the opening greeting he had thought about for a long time. Just as he hugged Gu Qi, he sensed that his body had stiffened. Thinking that Gu Qi was not used to his hug, he let go of Gu Qi and said with a smile, “Brother, don’t worry about being bullied. I’ll protect you in the future.”

Gu Qi’s expression darkened.

Although he knew that Xiao Bao was his biological younger brother, logically speaking, shouldn’t the older brother be protecting him? Why did Xiao Bao say that he wanted to protect him?

Seeing that Gu Qi didn’t look well, a trace of confusion flashed across Xiao Bao’s face. However, he didn’t think too much about it. He turned to look at Xiao Shi, who was beside Gu Qi, and pinched his sister’s face with a smile. “Sister, you’re so cute. If you’re bullied in the future, I’ll definitely help you beat the other party until he’s half dead.”

Xiao Bao patted his chest proudly and said, “I’m very skilled at fighting.”

When Xiao Shi heard Xiao Bao’s words, her eyes sparkled. She asked, “Second Brother, do you know how to fight?”

“Of course. In the past, when I followed Daddy…” Halfway through his sentence, Xiao Bao fell silent, and his eyes darkened. He didn’t know when he would see Daddy again. His eyes were a little wet, and his voice was a little choked. “I’ve specially trained for it. Why don’t I show you?”

Xiao Shi looked at Xiao Bao’s red eyes and took the initiative to hug him. She said gently, “Thank you, Second Brother. I believe that you will definitely be able to protect me well!”

Qiao Nian looked at the three little ones getting along harmoniously and couldn’t help but smile. Perhaps it was because of their blood ties, but the three of them quickly got familiar with each other. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Everyone, go wash your hands and prepare to eat.” Qiao Nian smiled at the three little ones and said gently.

Xiao Shi held Gu Qi’s hand with her left and Xiao Bao’s hand with her right as they walked towards the dining hall.
