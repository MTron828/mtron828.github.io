1064 Madam Bai’s Gentleness

“You two were especially close when you were young. I remember that once, when Ah Zhou was disobedient, I forced him to kneel in the ancestral hall. At that time, you even secretly brought him food, didn’t you?”

It was precisely because of this that Bai Hui had always felt that Yu Chu liked Gu Zhou. Yu Chu was an obedient child, so she wanted Yu Chu to marry Gu Zhou!

“Teacher, Brother Ah Zhou was a few years older than me. After I followed you to the city, my classmates bullied me in school. They laughed at my accent, and Brother Ah Zhou said harsh words, forcing them to apologize to me! On the way home from school, someone even tried to rob me. I was really frightened back then. It was Brother Ah Zhou who stepped forward and beat those baddies up until they couldn’t get up. Brother Ah Zhou is even better than my biological brother. I’ve always treated him as my brother!”

Yu Chu paused for a moment and continued, “I went to deliver food to Brother Ah Zhou because I really treat him as my brother. He usually protects me. When he’s in danger, it’s only right for me to protect him!”

When Bai Hui heard Yu Chu’s words, she lowered her eyes and recalled that the three of them had a good relationship when they were young.

When Yu Chu was in her first year of high school, she was sent overseas to study. After that, Yu Chu had been living overseas and rarely came back!

She still remembered that every year, Yu Chu would call Gu Yue and Gu Zhou. Sometimes, Yu Chu would also boldly remind them to eat well!

Seeing that Bai Hui was silent, Yu Chu didn’t know what she was thinking. She said carefully, “Teacher, I think Brother Ah Zhou and Second Sister-in-law like each other. Why don’t you accept Second Sister-in-law?”

The gentleness in Bai Hui’s eyes instantly disappeared, and her temples throbbed with anger. “Even if all the women in the world die and Qiao Nian is the only one left, I don’t want him to be with the daughter of the Lu family!”

Yu Chu had wanted to persuade Bai Hui again, but when she saw Bai Hui clutching her chest, she couldn’t say anything else.

Bai Hui seemed to have thought of something. When she looked at Yu Chu, her gaze softened again. “You said that you have someone you like. What’s the other party like?”

“Teacher, I don’t know what to say about this either. I’ll bring him to see you later!” Yu Chu said softly, her face red. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Bai Hui stood up and walked out.

Yu Chu supported Bai Hui.

Bai Hui turned to look at Yu Chu, who was beside her. The little girl had also grown up. Worried, she instructed, “There aren’t many good men nowadays. When you’re in a relationship, you have to keep your eyes open. If he’s not good, you must not be with him. That will only consume your enthusiasm!”

“Yes!”

“You have to maintain a happy mood when you’re in a relationship. If he makes you unhappy, he won’t be suitable for you!”

Yu Chu looked at Bai Hui gratefully and nodded vigorously.

“You’re just too easy to deceive!”

“With Teacher around, no one can lie to me!”

A trace of a smile flashed in Bai Hui’s eyes.

…

Gu Zhou drove Qiao Nian straight to the Dongjiang River.

Gu Zhou parked the car by the roadside and held Qiao Nian’s hand as they walked towards the river.

Gu Zhou parked the car by the roadside and held Qiao Nian’s hand as they walked towards the river.

Qiao Nian was still wearing a black down jacket. The hem of her skirt fluttered in the wind, and her small face looked even fairer and more beautiful under the light. She gave off a cold aura, as if she was a beauty in a painting. She could only be seen from afar, not touched!

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian and held her hand tightly. When he noticed, he realized that his hand was already intertwined with Qiao Nian’s.

He was already used to holding hands with Qiao Nian like this. It was as if he could get closer to her this way. Qiao Nian couldn’t escape even if she wanted to.

Neon lights flashed across the river. The traffic on the street was endless, leaving behind afterimages of lights.

It was so beautiful that it was comfortable.

Qiao Nian narrowed her eyes and looked across. With her other hand, she took out her phone and took a photo of everything on the other end.

Many years ago, she had drawn a stone wall painting.

She had the urge to draw the scene now. Her lips curved up slightly.

Qiao Nian put her phone in her pocket and turned to look at Gu Zhou. Smiling, she said, “You should take another photo. I’ll draw another painting! Just like many years ago!”

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian’s smiling face intently. Thinking of the past, he nodded. “I want to film you too!”

“Sure!”
