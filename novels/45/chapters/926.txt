927 Fourth Master

Fourth Master laughed. His laughter seemed to be mocking He Cheng. “With just you?”

He Cheng was a person who cared about his dignity. Usually, when others saw him, they would have to respectfully call him “Master He”. He had never expected Fourth Master to be so stubborn.

No one could stop him from getting the woman he wanted.

“Go!” He Cheng waved his hand, and the people behind him rushed forward!

!!

Qiao Nian stood behind Fourth Master. Although she didn’t know who Fourth Master was, he was protecting her. She had thought that no matter how powerful Fourth Master was, he was definitely no match for those people.

But she was wrong. Fourth Master easily knocked all of them to the ground.

Those people were lying on the ground and crying out in pain. Seeing that all his men had been beaten up, He Cheng hesitated to attack.

He Cheng had a good family background and was generous, so those people were all willing to follow him. He was not good at fighting at all.

When he thought of how Fourth Master had hit him cleanly and without hesitation just now, he chickened out again. If he attacked now, he would be beaten up!

A wise man submitted to circumstances.

Suppressing his anger, He Cheng said, “Fourth Master, we can be considered old acquaintances. Usually, we work separately and don’t interfere with each other. How can you…”

Before He Cheng could finish speaking, he met the killing intent in Fourth Master’s eyes. He was slightly stunned and could not say the rest.

He Cheng pursed his lips tightly. He had long known of Fourth Master’s ruthless methods. In the past, he had always avoided going against him.

But this time, he had received a huge sum of money. Someone wanted him to have sex with Qiao Nian.

Only a fool would reject such a good opportunity to have money and a beauty in his bed!

Seeing that He Cheng had no intention of attacking, Fourth Master calmly rolled down his sleeve and looked at He Cheng indifferently. “He Cheng, you should know that as long as it’s someone I am protecting, no one can touch a hair on her head. Before I get angry, you’d better take your people and get lost. Otherwise…”

When He Cheng heard Fourth Master’s words, he was stunned. He was so frightened that his body kept trembling.

When he met Fourth Master, he had heard him call himself “Fourth Brother”. He had investigated Fourth Master’s background in the past, but he could not find anything.

Those who could not be investigated were basically all from large families, because it was impossible for ordinary people to hide their backgrounds.

Fourth Master was definitely from a big family.

The anger in He Cheng’s eyes instantly disappeared. If Fourth Master didn’t use the power of his family, none of them would be his match. If Fourth Master used the power of his family, how could they gain anything?

“Let’s go!” He Cheng reluctantly left with his men.

At this moment, Qiao Xin had been hiding in a corner, watching the commotion in the distance. Her eyes gradually darkened.

She had wanted Qiao Nian to spend the night with several people tonight. That way, Qiao Nian would never be able to make a comeback.

However, all of this was ruined by that person called Fourth Brother.

Qiao Xin’s gaze gradually turned cold.

Strange.

She had never heard of Fourth Brother, nor had she seen him. What made her most curious was that He Cheng was actually afraid of Fourth Brother.

She glared fiercely at Qiao Nian. Even if Qiao Nian had avoided her scheme this time, she would never let Qiao Nian off. She had to make Qiao Nian’s life a living hell.

Qiao Nian watched as He Cheng and the others fled. Her gaze fell on Fourth Master’s face and she reached out to take off the suit jacket to return it to him.

Seeing this, Fourth Master frowned slightly and said, “There’s no need to return it. I don’t like to touch clothes that have been touched by others.”

When Qiao Nian heard Fourth Master’s words, she could understand. After all, some people were obsessed with cleanliness.

Moreover, her shawl had already been torn by that fool. Although it was fine to go out in just a strapless dress, there were all kinds of people in the hotel. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

For the sake of less trouble, it was better for her to wear a suit jacket.

“Thank you, sir. I wonder if you can leave me your contact information? I’ll treat you to a meal another day. Thank you for helping me out,” Qiao Nian said sincerely. She looked up at Fourth Master, who was standing in front of her.
