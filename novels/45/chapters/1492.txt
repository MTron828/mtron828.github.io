1493 Complicated

After a while, Gu Zhou’s thin lips parted slightly. His voice was a little cold as he said, “In other words, someone targeted her, which triggered her mental illness. However, others have always thought that she was just suffering from cerebral palsy.”

Gu Zhou paused for a moment and continued, “There’s a Hypnotic worm in her body?”

“I just sensed that there was a Hypnotic worm in her body, but I haven’t tested it. I’m not 100% sure.” At this point, Qiao Nian recalled that Madam President’s skin had turned purple. “I don’t know if she was poisoned because of the Hypnotic worm, or actual poison. The only thing I’m sure of is that someone attacked her.”

“The president probably didn’t do the kidnapping twenty years ago.”

Qiao Nian looked up and met Gu Zhou’s eyes. Qiao Nian hadn’t expected Gu Zhou to think the same way as her. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The people who had kidnapped Qiao Nian twenty years ago should be in the same group as the people who wanted to kill Lu Qi. It was also that group of people who had poisoned Uncle Zhao with the Hypnotic worm.

If the president had really kidnapped Qiao Nian, how could he bear to poison his Madam with a Hypnotic worm.

However, everything was just a guess now. They still needed to investigate thoroughly and get evidence.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips slightly and continued, “We’ll have to investigate the rest slowly. When I meet Madam President, there should be more progress. I keep feeling that the kidnapping more than twenty years ago seems to be very complicated…”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, his dark eyes gradually softened, as if the ice and snow in spring had melted. There was only gentleness in his eyes.

If the kidnapping more than twenty years ago could have been resolved so easily, the Lu family would have long discovered that the eldest daughter of the Lu family was not dead. Qiao Nian wouldn’t have only met her family more than twenty years later.

To be able to kidnap the eldest daughter of the Lu family under the nose of the Lu family and attack Lu Qi, those people were definitely not simple!

Gu Zhou lowered his gaze slightly and kissed Qiao Nian’s forehead comfortingly. “Don’t worry, there must be a way to resolve this.”

Gu Zhou’s low and hoarse voice lingered in Qiao Nian’s ears. It was like a soft feather, gently calming Qiao Nian’s uneasy heart.

Qiao Nian’s lips curved up slightly, and the gloom in her heart was swept away. Just as she was about to speak, she saw Lina walking over.

Lina’s face was pale. She had lost a lot of weight because of her injuries. From afar, she looked very haggard.

When Qiao Nian saw Lina, she looked up and gave Gu Zhou a look. Gu Zhou followed her gaze. When he saw Lina, he let go of Qiao Nian’s hand.

Qiao Nian smiled at Gu Zhou before walking towards Lina.

When Qiao Nian walked over to Lina, she naturally took her arm and asked gently, “What’s wrong? Are you unhappy?”

Lina’s gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. She frowned slightly, looking melancholic. “Nian Nian, my mother’s illness…”

When Qiao Nian heard Lina’s words, the smile on her face gradually faded. She said, “I need to do a more comprehensive examination of Madam President before I can confirm the treatment plan.”

Lina couldn’t help but sigh, her eyes filled with pain.

She had just heard about her mother’s relapse. This time, her mother’s relapse was very serious. Not only did she not recognize anyone, but she also hurt her father.

In the past, her mother had serious relapses, but her mother would only go crazy. She would not hurt herself or her father even if she broke things.

When she first saw the bandages on her father, she was shocked.

From this, it could be seen that her mother’s relapse was very serious this time. If her mother woke up and found out that she had hurt her father, how sad and hurt would she be?

At the thought of this, Lina’s head hurt. Her blue eyes gradually filled with tears. She looked at Qiao Nian helplessly, her voice choked. “Nian Nian, I’m really afraid. If even you can’t save my mother, will my mother be like this for the rest of her life…”
