1002 Forgive Uncle!

Lu Jiang smiled and said, “Alright, Uncle won’t kiss you anymore, okay?”

When she heard Lu Jiang’s promise, she nodded seriously and said, “Alright, I’ll forgive Uncle!”

Lu Jiang smiled and patted Xiao Shi’s head. He pretended to be afraid and said, “Then give Uncle a hug. Uncle was frightened by Xiao Shi just now!”

Xiao Shi thought about it and agreed. Her uncle treated her quite well and was about to prepare dowry for her mother. She seemed to have really frightened her uncle just now.

!!

Xiao Shi reached out and hugged Lu Jiang’s neck. She said in a childish voice, “Uncle, I’ll think of you well. Uncle, don’t be afraid!”

Lu Jiang was slightly stunned. His body stiffened, but he quickly calmed down. He patted Xiao Shi’s back gently and said softly, “Good girl, good girl. Uncle will miss Xiao Shi every day.”

Lu Jiang smelled the milky fragrance on her body. Her body was small and seemed to be very fragile. She needed to be protected well.

This was his niece.

What a cute niece.

Today was simply the luckiest day of his life.

Lu Jiang’s eyes couldn’t help but turn red.

Xiao Shi silently came out of Lu Jiang’s arms and smiled sweetly at him. Under Lu Jiang’s gentle gaze, she walked to Qiao Nian’s side on her short legs and held her hand.

Lu Jiang looked at Xiao Shi. He really couldn’t bear to part with his little niece. He said, “Can I bring Xiao Shi over to stay for a few days?”

“That’s not good.” Qiao Nian smiled and refused. She looked at Lu Jiang and shook her head. “If you bring her over and Grandma finds out, won’t the surprise be gone?”

When Lu Qi heard Qiao Nian’s words, she sighed regretfully.

Lu Jiang and Lu Qi left reluctantly.

Lu Jiang’s car was driven over by his secretary. The two of them got into the car. When they left the Gu family villa, Lu Qi seemed to have thought of something and looked at Lu Jiang in surprise.

Lu Jiang glanced at Lu Qi and said indifferently, “Why are you looking at me like that?”

Lu Qi shook her head and sized Lu Jiang up. She said uncertainly, “Fourth Brother, are you really not a fake?”

“What do you mean?” Lu Jiang was confused.

“Fourth Brother, I remember that you didn’t like little girls in the past.” Lu Qi looked at Lu Jiang suspiciously and continued, “In the past, there was a little girl in Second Uncle’s family who insisted that you hug her. In the end, you turned around and left, completely ignoring that little girl. That little girl cried until her tears flowed like a river. You didn’t care at all.”

“It’s different,” Lu Jiang said impatiently.

“How is she different?” Lu Qi thought about it carefully. They were both little girls!

“Xiao Shi is Nian’er’s child,” Lu Jiang said seriously.

When Lu Qi heard Lu Jiang’s words, her expression froze.

In the past, she had been too one-sided. She had thought that Fourth Brother didn’t like little girls. Now, it seemed that he just didn’t like other little girls.

In the entire family, only Fourth Brother did not care about his sister’s affairs, as if he had no feelings for her at all.

Now, it seemed that it was not that Fourth Brother did not care about his sister, but that he cared about her in a different way.

His sister had been kidnapped when she was still a little girl, so this incident had left a shadow in Fourth Brother’s heart. Therefore, Fourth Brother hated little girls.

His sister was still alive now.

Whenever Lu Qi thought of this, her lips curved up involuntarily.

All these years, everyone in the family had a wound in their hearts. Everyone was thinking about their sister.

As long as his sister was alive, the wounds of everyone in the family would heal.

Lu Qi said with interest, “Fourth Brother, since you like little girls, why don’t you give birth to a few more girls in the future? That way, you…”

Before she could finish speaking, she immediately received Lu Jiang’s cold gaze.

“Fourth Brother, I’m no longer the sister you care about.” Lu Qi silently moved to the side and said, “Your gaze makes me think that you want to stab me.”

Lu Jiang asked, “Do you think I can have a child?”

Lu Qi didn’t react at first, but she quickly came back to her senses. She burst out laughing and said, “Fourth Brother, I didn’t say that you were the one who will give birth. I meant Fourth Sister-in-law. Do you think I’m Xiao Shi?”
