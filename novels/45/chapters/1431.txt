1432 Starting to Doubt

Seeing how serious Xiao Bao was, Gu Zhou’s lips curved up slightly. Previously, the three children had made a fuss about wanting younger siblings.

Out of the corner of her eye, Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou. Seeing the corners of Gu Zhou’s mouth curl up, her ears turned red uncontrollably. She turned her attention back to the phone screen and said seriously, “Xiao Bao, don’t you already have a sister?”

Xiao Shi hurriedly said, “Mommy, I don’t have a younger brother or sister yet!”

At this point, Xiao Shi looked aggrieved.

Seeing that Xiao Shi had suffered, Gu Qi said aggrievedly, “Mommy, I want a younger brother or sister too!”

Qiao Nian really had a headache.

She had heard from others in the past that after getting married, a couple would give birth.

She and Gu Zhou’s elders did not ask her to give birth much, but her three children kept asking her to give birth.

Just as Qiao Nian was about to speak, she heard Xiao Shi look behind her and ask seriously, “Grandma and great-grandmother, don’t you think I’m right?”

Qiao Nian’s face turned red uncontrollably.

She had thought that she was on the phone with the three children. She didn’t expect her family to be here.

Qiao Nian yearned to find a place to hide. She didn’t want to discuss giving birth at all now. Smiling, she said, “Alright, Xiao Shi, can you give Grandma your phone? I want to say a few words to Grandma.”

When Xiao Shi heard “alright”, her eyes lit up. The three little ones exchanged glances and smiled happily.

Mommy had agreed to give birth to a younger brother or sister for them! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Xiao Shi gave a sweet smile and nodded. “Okay!”

Xiao Shi ran to Su Yan with her cell phone and handed it to her. She said in a childish voice, “Grandma, Mommy wants to talk to you on the phone!”

Su Yan smiled and took the phone. She really didn’t expect these three children to want their mom to give birth.

Su Yan looked at Qiao Nian on the phone screen, her eyes filled with reluctance. It hadn’t been easy for her to find her daughter, but her daughter had to run around for family matters. The mother and daughter couldn’t stay together for long. At the thought of this, she sighed in her heart.

However, Su Yan didn’t show it on her face. She smiled at Qiao Nian and instructed seriously, “Sugar, when you’re there, you have to take good care of yourself. I heard from Fourth Brother that he’s arranged for a chef in the villa. That chef knows how to make An City’s dishes. Don’t lose weight from starvation.”

Qiao Nian smiled and agreed. Then, she said, “Mom, I even met the seventh princess, the daughter of the President of Europe today. She seems to be of mixed blood. She wore a cheongsam today and seems to like our country’s culture very much. When I first saw her, I noticed her eyes. Her eyes are almost identical to Teacher Shen’s when he was young.”

When Su Yan heard Qiao Nian’s words, a trace of surprise flashed in her eyes. “Perhaps her eyes are similar to Teacher Shen’s.”

“I think so too.” Qiao Nian paused for a moment and continued, “I previously found out more about the kidnapping twenty years ago. It’s related to the President of Europe.”

Su Yan’s hand, which was holding the phone, trembled slightly. She understood what Qiao Nian meant.

Some things might be coincidental, but if many coincidences were put together, it wouldn’t be coincidental.

“Mom, send me another photo of Teacher Shen’s daughter. If I can see Madam President, I’ll be able to confirm if Teacher Sun’s daughter is Madam President,” Qiao Nian said seriously.

Su Yan did not speak immediately. Teacher Shen’s daughter had cerebral palsy. If the President of Europe was a normal person, why would he marry someone with cerebral palsy?

After a while, Su Yan said, “I don’t think that’s possible, but I’ll still send you a photo of Teacher Shen’s daughter. If you meet his daughter in Europe and can bring her back, bring her back!”

Su Yan said these words ambiguously. She believed that Qiao Nian could understand.

Only they knew that Teacher Shen had faked his death. The reason why they didn’t make it clear on the chat app was because they were worried that someone would eavesdrop on their conversation.
