875 Lying

If her matter was exposed today, Qiao Nian might notice what had happened more than twenty years ago.

It seemed that she could not return to the Lu family now. All her plans had been ruined.

Song Man’s gaze landed on Xiao Shi’s face and met her confused eyes.

Xiao Shi was everything to her now. Only Xiao Shi could protect her. She had to hold on to her tightly.

With this thought in mind, Song Man sat back down beside Xiao Shi and said coldly to Qiao Nian, “I have to accompany Xiao Shi now. Xiao Shi needs me too. If you still want to say anything, we’ll talk about it in the future!”

Xiao Shi looked at Song Man in confusion, not understanding what had happened.

Gu Zhou looked at Xiao Shi and recalled how she had just woken up to look for Song Man. He tried hard to suppress his anger and said in a low voice, “Song Man, I’ll give you one last chance. If you’re willing to confess everything, I’ll let bygones be bygones!”

Song Man raised her eyebrows slightly and looked up at Gu Zhou. She asked, “What do you want me to say? That I’m not Xiao Shi’s mother?”

When she heard Song Man’s words, she grabbed her hand and looked at Gu Zhou anxiously. She said firmly, “Daddy, she’s my mommy!”

When Gu Zhou heard Xiao Shi’s words, he pursed his lips slightly and his expression darkened.

Song Man naturally knew what Gu Zhou wanted her to say, but she refused to say it. As long as she had Xiao Shi to protect her, she was not afraid of anything.

Gu Zhou’s expression darkened. “Don’t go too far!”

Song Man’s gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face. In the end, she lowered her gaze. When she looked at Xiao Shi again, her eyes were filled with tears, and there was a trace of hurt in her voice. “Xiao Shi, he’s the father you’ve always wanted to protect. They want to force me now into a corner. What have I done wrong? Just because I raised you alone, they’re going to suspect me?”

Xiao Shi looked at Song Man’s face, her eyes filled with confusion. Puzzled, she asked. “Mommy, is there anything you haven’t told us? If you tell us clearly, won’t everyone not misunderstand?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

When Song Man heard her question, she was stunned.

At this moment, she clearly realized that although Xiao Shi was on her sideand she was only related to herby blood, she would still believe Gu Zhou without thinking.

Song Man slowly lowered her gaze, hiding the sadness in her eyes.

Qiao Nian stood at the side and looked at Song Man, her eyes filled with coldness. “Song Man, this is between us adults. Don’t use Xiao Shi as a shield. She loves you so much, but you’re using her! You’re not her mommy. How can you lie to her?”

Xiao Shi’s eyes turned red. At this moment, she didn’t know who to listen to.

Song Man glanced at Xiao Shi and saw that she was a little sad. Actually, she still had a trace of regret. If she was still in Hai Cheng…

How could she give up her rich life for Xiao Shi?

She had given so much. She deserved so much.

Song Man’s eyes gradually hardened. Her gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. She didn’t know how much Qiao Nian had investigated.

“Miss Qiao, what exactly are you thinking? Why are you saying that I’m not Xiao Shi’s biological mother? Or do you think my appearance threatens your status? You’re were never willing to believe that I’m Xiao Shi’s biological mother!” Song Man stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian’s face, not missing a single movement.

When she heard Song Man’s words, she was stunned. Her eyes widened in disbelief.

Was she hallucinating?

Why did Auntie Nian Nian say that Mommy wasn’t her mommy?

Mommy was clearly her mommy!

Mommy had brought her up since she was young. She had lived with Mommy for more than five years.

Mommy was the person who understood her the best in the world. Mommy was also the person she relied on the most in the world.

When Qiao Nian heard Song Man’s words, she sneered. Song Man really wouldn’t shed a tear until she saw her coffin!

“Of course it’s because I’m a doctor. A fake is ultimately a fake. Even if I didn’t discover it the first time, I’ll still discover it in the future, because what is fake can’t be real. What is real can’t be fake.”
