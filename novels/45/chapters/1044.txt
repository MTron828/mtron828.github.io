1045 Hell

“Lu Zhu came to us and asked us to hand Qiao Xin and He Cheng over to him.” When Qiao Shan thought of Lu Zhu’s expression at that time, he still felt a little afraid.

“You’ll do whatever he says?” Qiao Yu’s face was red with anger. He couldn’t lose his temper at the two of them because they were his parents.

Su Xue could tell that Qiao Yu’s tone wasn’t good. She hurriedly tried to smooth things over and said, “Lu Zhu threatened us back then. If we didn’t hand Qiao Xin over, he would ruin you and the Gu family!”

“So you handed Qiao Xin over in exchange for my safety and the Gu family’s safety?” Qiao Yu was so angry that his head was about to explode. He looked at the two people in front of him in disappointment and said in a low voice, “Don’t you think you’ve gone too far? When did I ask you to sacrifice Qiao Xin for me?”

When Su Xue heard Qiao Yu’s words, tears streamed down her face. She said tearfully, “Actually, I regretted it back then. I had already let Qiao Xin escape, but for some reason, Lu Zhu still found Qiao Xin. There was nothing I could do. I don’t know what to do now. Xin Xin is ruined. How will she live in the future?”

When Qiao Yu heard Su Xue say that Qiao Xin had been ruined, Qiao Nian’s helpless face from six years ago flashed in his mind.

At that time, Qiao Nian should have been extremely afraid.

At that time, Qiao Nian probably no longer had the courage to live.

At that time, he actually didn’t believe her.

Qiao Yu looked at the two people in front of him weakly and said in disappointment, “Why did you do this?”

Su Xue covered her face and cried. Her most beloved daughter had become like this, and she didn’t know what to do.

Qiao Shan sat on the bed, his face filled with disappointment.

“Why?” Qiao Yu frowned and said in despair, “Why did you hurt Qiao Nian from the beginning? Just because Qiao Nian is more outstanding than Qiao Xin, you want to hurt her?”

“As long as she’s more outstanding than Qiao Xin, she’s not worthy of living?”

“Qiao Nian is clearly very magnanimous. Why do you keep hurting her? She no longer wants to argue with us about so many things. You’re the ones who forced her to fight back time and time again!”

“Now that things are about to reach a dead end, you want to sacrifice Qiao Xin in exchange for the safety of your family. Have you ever thought that you’re no different from before?”

“Exquisite self-interest and selfishness. I’d rather lose all the Qiao family’s businesses. I’d rather be an ordinary office worker. I don’t want Qiao Xin to be bullied!”

…

When Qiao Shan heard Qiao Yu’s words, he frowned in anger. He said angrily, “Shut up. How did you…”

At this moment, the door opened.

A female doctor walked in anxiously and asked, “Excuse me, are you family members of the patient, Qiao Xin?”

When Qiao Shan heard the words “Qiao Xin”, he subconsciously looked away. He, Qiao Shan, had been in the business world for many years. He didn’t expect to be utterly humiliated now.

Qiao Yu didn’t think too much about it. He looked at the doctor worriedly and asked, “Yes, I’m Qiao Xin’s brother. May I know what’s wrong with Qiao Xin?” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Su Xue immediately stood up. Wiping her tears, she walked towards the doctor. “What happened?”

The female doctor frowned and said sternly, “Qiao Xin was just sent to the hospital. Her condition isn’t good. She needs surgery immediately, but we need the signature of the patient’s family!”

“I’ll sign it. I’m her mother.” At the thought of those videos, Su Xue’s tears fell again. She took a step forward, and her legs gave way, almost falling to the ground.

Fortunately, she was supported by Qiao Yu.

Qiao Yu had wanted to follow her as well. Su Xue glanced at Qiao Shan, who was lying on the bed, and said gently, “Stay in the ward and watch over your father. He’s in a bad mood, and he regrets it very much.”

Qiao Yu turned back to look at Qiao Shan, who was lying on the bed. Qiao Shan had his head lowered, looking like a defeated rooster. He had long lost his former arrogance, and Qiao Shan’s hair had turned white.

Qiao Yu frowned slightly. It seemed that his father didn’t want this to happen to Qiao Xin either. He was so anxious that his hair had turned white.

“Yes, I’ll stay behind to take care of Dad.” At this point, Qiao Yu recalled what Qiao Xin had just experienced. Although he was Qiao Xin’s biological brother, it was not convenient for him to go over now. “Mom, when you see Qiao Xin, speak gently.”
