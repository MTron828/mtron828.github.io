857 Not Too Late! F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Even though that kiss was as brief as a dragonfly skimming the surface of the water, it was like a stone falling into his calm heart. Layers of ripples appeared in his heart.

Qiao Nian landed on her heels and looked up at Gu Zhou with a smile. At some point, her fox-like eyes had been covered in a layer of moisture. Her lips curved up slightly as she said seriously, “Brother Chuan, thank you!”

When Gu Zhou heard this, his breathing tightened and his throat moved involuntarily. He looked at Qiao Nian with a burning gaze. “You… you remember everything?”

Qiao Nian smiled and shook her head. She said truthfully, “When I was six years old, I almost fell off a cliff. I’ve never forgotten that you saved me. However, I’ve always mistook my savior for someone else!”

!!

At this point, the smile on Qiao Nian’s face gradually disappeared. She lowered her gaze and said guiltily, “It’s all my fault. If I had realized that I had mistaken someone else as my benefactor back then, I might have recognized you long ago!”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, his thin lips curved up slightly. He bent down slightly and looked at Qiao Nian at eye level. His voice was clear as wine. “It’s not too late!”

Qiao Nian looked up and met Gu Zhou’s smiling eyes. His pupils were filled with her face.

“But you still came back to me.”

Qiao Nian’s heart skipped a beat, and her lips slowly curved up. Now, it seemed that Gu Zhou was a very gentle person. She nodded. “Yes.”

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian’s face seriously and asked, “You won’t leave in the future, will you?”

Qiao Nian was about to answer Gu Zhou when she sensed a very uncomfortable gaze on her. She turned her head and saw Song Man staring at her coldly.

Qiao Nian frowned. She didn’t know when Song Man had come out, nor did she know what she had said to Gu Zhou.

However, the way Song Man looked at her made her very uncomfortable.

Gu Zhou followed Qiao Nian’s gaze. When he saw Song Man, his eyes instantly turned cold, and he gradually stood up straight.

He almost found out about Qiao Nian’s answer.

However, all of this was ruined by Song Man.

Gu Zhou pursed his lips tightly, exuding a cold aura.

Song Man didn’t seem to see the displeasure in Gu Zhou’s heart. A gentle smile appeared on her face as she said, “Mr. Gu and Miss Qiao, why are you here?”

Gu Zhou looked away from Song Man with an indifferent expression. He took Qiao Nian’s hand and interlocked their fingers. After seeing Qiao Nian’s gentle gaze, he looked away with cold eyes.

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze slightly and stood quietly beside Gu Zhou, following him in.

Song Man looked at Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian, her heart aching. The two of them really looked like a match made in heaven.

It was precisely because of this feeling that Song Man felt terrible. She pursed her lips slightly. When Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian walked over, she tried hard to smile. “Mr. Gu, you…”

“I’m looking for you!” Gu Zhou interrupted Song Man’s polite words mercilessly.

Song Man met Gu Zhou’s cold gaze. For some reason, she had a bad feeling. It was as if an invisible hand was tightening around her neck, suffocating her.

Instinctively, she stepped aside bit by bit, allowing Gu Zhou to hold Qiao Nian’s hand and walk in.

Song Man looked at Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian’s backs. The two of them were holding hands. Her heart felt as if it had been cut into pieces. It was so painful that her tears were about to fall.

When they arrived at the living room, Gu Zhou turned to look at Qiao Nian and asked, “Do you know where the medicine box is?”

Previously, Qiao Nian had come to take care of Gu Qi and Xiao Shi. She had also done a DNA paternity test for Xiao Shi and knew the location of the medicine box.

She nodded and walked towards a locker. She opened it and took out the medicine box.

Seeing that Qiao Nian had yet to arrive, Song Man thought that she had to seize the opportunity as soon as possible. She looked up at Gu Zhou, her eyes filled with grievance. She said guiltily, “I’m really sorry. My appearance might be a problem. I’ve disturbed your private time with Miss Qiao.”

Song Man was good-looking. She lowered her gaze, her black hair hanging down. Her eyes were filled with tears, and she looked pitiful.

Seeing Song Man like this, Gu Zhou frowned.
