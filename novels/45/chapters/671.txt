Chapter 672: It’s Real

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

This could only prove one thing. Qiao Nian was Sugar.

When people grew up, they would gradually forget what had happened when they were young. However, if they experienced it personally and encountered the same situation when they grew up, it was very likely that they would recall their childhood memories.

Lu Nian’s pupils trembled involuntarily. He looked at Qiao Nian lovingly and said in a hoarse voice, “Yes, when you were young, you loved to hear me play the piano. Moreover, I often brought you here. Although you usually like to be mischievous, you’ll become very obedient when you hear me play the piano.”

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Nian’s words, she clenched her fists involuntarily and bit her lip. After a long while, she said tearfully, “So those are all true…”

It was actually not a dream.

At that time, she was still too young to remember many things.

She often dreamed of a young man in white playing the piano. She even told her grandfather about this.

At that time, her grandfather had told her that those could be dreams or memories of her childhood.

Some people would remember their childhood dreams when they were overjoyed and sad.

However, at that time, she was too young to realize that the boy in her memory was her biological brother. She had always thought that it was Qiao Yu.

She had no idea that she was not a child of the Qiao family.

At that time, she had placed her hopes on the Qiao couple, hoping that they would bring her to live in the city.

But these hopes gradually disappeared.

If she hadn’t overheard Su Xue’s words that time, she would never have thought that she wasn’t a member of the Qiao family.

It was from then on that she went everywhere to look for her biological parents.

If only she had realized earlier that she was not a child of the Qiao family.

If only she could find her biological parents earlier, or if she could find that place and the person in her dream based on her memories.

Would she be able to reunite with her family sooner?

She and her family would not have been separated for more than twenty years.

Fate really made fools of people.

However, the only thing that made Qiao Nian feel lucky was that she had finally found her family.

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian’s eyes couldn’t help but turn red.

She had gone through a lot to find her family.

Lu Zhu looked at Qiao Nian and felt his eyes sting. He silently turned his head to the side to ease the pain in his heart.

Fortunately, their Sugar had finally returned home.

Ever since Lu Zhu reunited with Qiao Nian, he had always felt that it was unreal. Occasionally, he would wake up from his sleep. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Now that Qiao Nian and Second Brother had acknowledged each other, he was completely certain that they had really found Sugar.

Lu Nian felt a little stuffy in his chest, and his eyes turned red. His gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face and his heart ached when he saw her red eyes.

He reached out and carefully wiped the tears from Qiao Nian’s eyes. His beautiful phoenix-like eyes were filled with gentleness and pity. He said softly, “Sugar, welcome home. When you come back, Mom and Dad will definitely be very happy to know that you’re still alive!”

Lu Nian’s words instantly woke Lu Zhu and Qiao Nian up from their trance.

Qiao Nian hurriedly shook her head. Just as she was about to explain, Lu Nian spoke.

“Sugar can’t go home yet!”

When Lu Nian heard Lu Zhu’s words, he frowned. He instantly understood. Why would his brother say that?

Lu Nian’s frown deepened. His voice was low. “What happened to Sister back then isn’t simple?”

“Yes.” Lu Zhu nodded without hesitation. After returning to An City, he had not been idle. He had already gotten someone to investigate the situation back then, but there were no clues.

Lu Nian looked at Lu Zhu’s face, then at Qiao Nian. He analyzed seriously, “The kidnappers back then have already been killed. If Nian Nian returns now, it seems to be telling the entire world that the eldest daughter of the Lu family isn’t dead. The person who planned all of this back then will definitely do something else. If I’m not wrong, those kidnappers should be just scapegoats for those people.”
