Chapter 1811 - 1811 Biased

As soon as Old Master Qin walked out of the station, Qiao Nian hugged him.

Old Master Qin smiled and heard Qiao Nian’s gentle voice. “Grandpa.”

He looked at the little girl in his arms and patted her back gently, just like how he coaxed her when she was young. “My good Nian Nian. I heard that your matters in Europe went very smoothly this time.”

Qiao Nian smiled and let go of Old Master Qin. She held his arm and walked out. “Yes, everything is going well. It’s just that Chen Qing is injured. He’s already been treated. He’s fine.”

At the thought that the haze of the past had completely disappeared, Qiao Nian felt much better than usual.

“Awesome. My Nian Nian has already grown up and become a heroine,” Old Master Qin praised without hesitation.

Hearing Old Master Qin’s words, Chang Feng could not help but laugh. He said, “Grandpa is right. Back then, Little Junior Sister only knew how to cry. Now, Little Junior Sister is very powerful.”

Old Master Qin looked at Qiao Nian even more gently. His daughter had grown up. It was really a happy thing. “Alright, alright, alright! However, your Eldest Senior Brother’s words are so petty. In the future, when your Eldest Senior Brother and Xiao Chuan beg you to treat them, you have to make things difficult for them!”

When Chang Feng heard Old Master Qin’s words, he smiled helplessly.

In the past, Grandpa was also the most biased towards Nian Nian.

The group of them chatted and laughed. When they reached the parking lot, Qiao Nian said seriously, “Grandpa, it’s rare for our family to be together. Why don’t we go straight to the hospital to look for Old Qin? He must really want to see us.”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, the smile on Old Master Qin’s face froze.

He had not seen Xiao Chuan for a long time. At first, he thought that he would never have the chance to see Xiao Chuan in his life.

Old Master Qin took a deep breath and said with red eyes, “In the past few years, he has grown up a lot. What makes me most gratified is that he knows how to protect his junior sister!”

Qiao Nian’s eyes turned red.

After her grandfather disappeared, Old Qin seemed to have become a different person. He was loyal to her and took care of her meticulously.

Qiao Nian looked at Old Master Qin solemnly. “This time, Old Master Qin was injured because he protected my sister. He’s much better now, but he hasn’t regained his memories.”

She felt uneasy and quickly asked, “Grandpa, do you have a way to help him recover his memories?”

“He did what he should have done. Don’t think too much.” In Old Master Qin’s opinion, it was fine as long as his grandson was still alive.

Qiao Nian knew that her grandfather hoped that Qin Chuan would not be as sloppy as before. It was good that he could learn to take responsibility.

Over the years, Qin Chuan had done well enough.

Qiao Nian still remembered Old Qin’s attitude towards Lu Qi. It seemed that Lu Qi’s identity had to be revealed by Old Qin himself.

In the hospital ward.

Qin Chuan leaned against the bed. His fingers were quickly typing on the keyboard, and his charming peach blossom eyes narrowed slightly.

There were many nurses standing at the door of the ward. All of them looked at the exquisite scene of Qin Chuan handling matters in a daze. Their hearts were beating wildly, as if they were about to jump out of their chests in the next moment.

Perhaps because of the nurses’ burning gazes, Qin Chuan closed his laptop and looked at the door. He was the first to ask, “I feel much better. Can I go through the discharge procedures?”

The door of the ward was opened by a nurse. The nurse standing at the front blushed and said, “I-I’m afraid this won’t do. A patient can only be discharged after the family settles the discharge procedures.”

Family?

Qin Chuan lowered his eyes slightly, his eyes dimmed a lot, and his thoughts gradually drifted away.

Seeing that Qin Chuan’s expression was not good, the nurses left one by one.

After a long time, the door was pushed open.

Qin Chuan looked over warily. “Who is it!”

Chang Feng slowly walked up to Qin Chuan and smiled at him. “It’s me.”

Qin Chuan’s gaze landed on Chang Feng. Chang Feng’s appearance was no different from back then. The only thing that had changed was that he seemed to have become even more muscular, and he still had the killing aura.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com
