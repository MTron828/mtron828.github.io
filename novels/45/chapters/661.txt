Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

When Su Sheng heard Lu Nian’s words, she was about to break down. Her eyes were filled with sorrow as she said in pain, “When I was 18, I fell in love with you the first time I heard your music. I collected all your music. I like you so much. I’m a loyal fan of yours. How can you say such hurtful words? I’m clearly so good. Why don’t you like me?”

“Who in this world has set the rule that if you like me, I have to like you?” Lu Nian’s eyes turned cold as he said impatiently.

Su Sheng swayed on the spot.

Her fragile heart seemed to have been smashed to the ground by Lu Nian, shattering into countless pieces.

When Su Sheng was in school, she was known as a genius beauty. When she came out of school, she opened a counseling studio with Gu Qing. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

She had seen all the rich people in An City. No one sneered at her beauty.

There were also many wealthy people who asked about her marriage status. Countless people wanted to marry her.

But she had rejected those people mercilessly.

In her opinion, those rich second-generation heirs were all useless. Her future husband had to be a genius, and he must shine in his field.

When she found out that Lu Nian was Mr. Dong Hua, she had already put herself in the role of Mr. Dong Hua’s wife.

She was a world-renowned genius psychiatrist, and Lu Nian was a world-renowned composer.

How compatible the two of them were.

Who did Qiao Nian think she was?

Qiao Nian wasn’t even worthy of carrying their shoes.

“But why do you like Qiao Nian? What’s so good about Qiao Nian?” Su Sheng looked at Lu Nian sadly, her gaze finally moving to Qiao Nian’s face.

Was this like what others said? If a woman wasn’t bad, a man wouldn’t like her?

Lu Nian clearly knew that Qiao Nian was with another man, but he still liked her.

At this moment, Qiao Nian was slightly stunned.

Only then did she realize that Su Sheng thought that Second Brother liked her.

How was that possible? They were biological siblings!

No, no.

Second Brother didn’t know her identity now, but he also knew about her relationship with Gu Zhou. It was impossible for Second Brother to have feelings for her like a man would for a woman.

Second Brother was treating her well now not only because he felt that she was talented in music, but also because of Gu Zhou.

Had Su Sheng gone crazy?

How could she spout nonsense?

When Lu Nian heard Su Sheng’s words, he frowned.

Only then did he realize that Su Sheng had said that he liked Qiao Nian.

He had no romantic feelings for Qiao Nian at all. He only treated her as his younger sister.

He knew that if he didn’t reject Su Sheng explicitly, he would be in a lot of trouble in the future.

Lu Nian said, “That’s because she’s Qiao Nian!”

At this moment, the piano room instantly fell silent. Su Sheng looked at Lu Nian in disbelief.

Lu Nian’s words were like an invisible slap to her face, hurting her heart.

Su Sheng’s heart ached so much that it was difficult to breathe. Frowning, she looked at Qiao Nian. “She’s been cheating on many people. How can you like such a woman? She’s a bad woman!”

“Are you any better?” Lu Nian asked.

“When I went to the Gu residence, I realized that Mr. Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian had an extraordinary relationship. Look at the wound at the corner of Qiao Nian’s mouth. Gu Zhou must have bitten her!” Su Sheng said in exasperation.

Hearing this, Lu Nian and Gu Qing both looked at Qiao Nian in unison.

Actually, Gu Qing was the most shocked. She had never expected someone with a phobia of women to do such a thing to a woman.

Gu Zhou bit Qiao Nian’s mouth.

If this matter were to be posted online, it would definitely rank first on the trending searches.

Gu Qing was very curious. Did Gu Zhou really like Qiao Nian a lot?

Lu Nian looked at Qiao Nian’s lips, his eyes darkening slightly.

He remembered that whenever Gu Zhou mentioned Qiao Nian, he always looked gentle.

At that time, he had been very surprised that Gu Zhou would believe a woman unconditionally.

After meeting Qiao Nian, he finally understood why Gu Zhou liked Qiao Nian so much. Qiao Nian was too obedient and smart.
