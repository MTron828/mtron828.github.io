935 A Chess Piece

Lu Zhu comforted her. “Don’t worry, I knew my limits back then. She was only shot in the leg. This shot won’t kill her!”

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Zhu’s words, she heaved a sigh of relief.

“I asked her today. She doesn’t know much about Song Man,” Lu Zhu said thoughtfully.

Qiao Nian nodded in agreement and said, “She’s probably just one of Song Man’s pawns. Song Man’s matter definitely isn’t that simple. There must be many people behind her. Those people have been controlling this matter for more than twenty years. How can they give themselves away so easily?”

“It’s like this. More than twenty years have passed since this incident. If we want to investigate it thoroughly, we have to take some time. Sugar, it’s getting late. You should rest early!” Lu Zhu sat in front of the desk, a trace of heartache flashing in his eyes. “If there’s anything, I’ll settle it for you!”

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Zhu’s words, her eyes couldn’t help but turn red.

It felt good to be doted on by her brother. Her heart warmed, and the uneasiness in her heart gradually disappeared. “Brother, I understand, but you have to rest early too. Don’t tire yourself out!”

After Qiao Nian hung up, her gaze fell on the brightly lit Gu family villa. She hesitated for a moment before unbuckling her seatbelt and getting out of the car.

Qiao Nian walked into the villa. When she walked into the living room, she saw the butler tidying up.

“Young Madam.” Seeing Qiao Nian walk in, the butler stopped what he was doing and said with a smile, “The hot water has been prepared for you. You can take a shower and rest when you go up!”

“Thank you.” Qiao Nian smiled gently and walked upstairs with her bag. When she reached the stairs, she seemed to have thought of something and stopped in her tracks. She turned to look at the butler and asked curiously, “Butler, where’s Gu Zhou?”

A gentle smile appeared on the butler’s face as he said, “Young Master called back in advance and said that there was an urgent matter at the company. He might not be back tonight.”

Hearing the butler’s words, Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief, but also felt a trace of disappointment.

She could think about what to do in the future.

Qiao Nian smiled at the butler, then went upstairs to rest.

… .

Outside the hospital emergency room.

Su Xue waited anxiously outside the emergency room, tears streaming down her face. She looked at the emergency room door with teary eyes.

Qiao Shan sat on a public chair at the side. Seeing Su Xue pacing back and forth and crying, he frowned. His anger gradually rose. “Why are you walking around? It’s so annoying!”

Su Xue was shocked, but she didn’t dare to walk around. She walked to the side and sat down quietly.

Qiao Shan saw Su Xue crying and wiping her tears. He was also worried about Qiao Xin in the emergency room, but was it useful to worry now?

He suppressed the anxiety in his heart.

At this moment, he heard Su Xue sobbing softly. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Why are you crying? Why are you crying? Your daughter is still alive. Are you cursing her on purpose?” Qiao Shan said angrily.

When Su Xue heard Qiao Shan’s words, tears streamed down her face. She wiped her tears with a tissue and said in a choked voice, “Xin Xin is my life. If anything happens to her, there’s no point in me living!”

When Qiao Shan heard Su Xue’s words, he was a little moved. He had been with Su Xue for about thirty years. In the past, the two of them had not lived well, and Su Xue had always been by his side.

He remembered that there was once when he was so busy that he didn’t get home until midnight. When he got home, he thought that Su Xue had already fallen asleep. He didn’t expect Su Xue to be knitting a sweater and waiting for him on the sofa in the living room.

At that time, Qiao Shan realized what he wanted. No matter when he returned home, there would always be someone waiting for him.

Qiao Shan sighed slightly and said, “Alright, stop crying. No matter who hurt our daughter, I have to make them pay with their lives!”

Su Xue was slightly stunned. She hadn’t expected Qiao Shan to comfort her. Her heart warmed, as if there was a trace of comfort.

Su Xue also realized that Qiao Shan’s tone had softened. Did this mean that Qiao Shan would forgive her soon?
