Chapter 328: Deadly Strike

As soon as Ye Ran finished speaking, the eyes of those people lit up.

One hundred thousand dollars.

This was a huge sum of money to them. They pounced on Gao Lin.

Gao Lin screamed, but her scream was quickly drowned out by the noise near the stadium.

Seeing Gao Lin struggling at death’s door, Ye Ran was overjoyed. “You fence-sitter! Trash!”

“Ah, it hurts. Ye Ran, please, please let me off!”

When Ye Ran heard Gao Lin begging for mercy, she asked coldly, “Beg for mercy? Do you know how to beg for mercy now? I begged you the same way that night. Why won’t you let me off?”

Gao Lin had never expected things to turn out this way. If her family found out about what she had done in school, her father would be so angry that he would chase her out of the house!

She was an illegitimate daughter to begin with. Everyone was laughing at her, and no one was willing to help her.

Today, she thought that if she could meet Mr. Dong Hua, she would have a chance to make a comeback. Then, she would kill Qiao Nian.

But Qiao Nian had blocked her last chance of survival.

Now, she had fallen into Ye Ran’s hands again. She probably wouldn’t be so lucky this time.

Gao Lin hurriedly shielded her face with her hands. She didn’t want to become an ugly freak like Ye Ran, but these people were targeting her face!

Gao Lin’s face instantly swelled up. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Ye Ran had always been pampered by her family. Her temper had always been bad. Now that she had finally found an opportunity to take revenge, she yearned to kill Gao Lin.

Ye Ran looked down at Gao Lin. Seeing Gao Lin behaving like a rat crossing the street, she felt no joy.

For a moment, she mistook Gao Lin for Qiao Nian.

Ye Ran gripped the baseball bat tightly. She had already made up her mind today. She would never let Qiao Nian leave this place alive.

Hatred surged in Ye Ran’s heart.

She had been pampered by her parents since she was young. If it weren’t for Qiao Nian, how could she have been thrown into a vocational school by her parents to fend for herself?

All her pride over the years had been ruined by a single ticket.

She had never expected to be expelled from school because of that fake ticket.

Her teachers and classmates despised her. Someone like Gao Lin even took the opportunity to deal with her.

All of this was because of Qiao Nian. That b*tch Qiao Nian had ruined everything for her!

She was now just a street hooligan. How could Qiao Nian become Mr. Dong Hua’s female musician? This was too unfair!

She wanted to kill Qiao Nian!

She would never let Qiao Nian live!

Ye Ran raised the baseball bat high and smashed it down on Gao Lin’s head without hesitation.

“Ah!”

Gao Lin screamed loudly. Her eyes rolled back in her head, and her body trembled involuntarily.

She was in a daze. At this moment, she felt as if she had become Qiao Nian, the female musician who had performed with Mr. Dong Hua. She was receiving the affirmation and admiration of everyone.

She debuted at the peak and then became a famous musician.

However, in reality, Gao Lin’s nose was bleeding, staining her white dress red. It was a ghastly sight.

“Ah!” A delinquent girl hurriedly shouted and took two steps back.

Seeing this, the others also left.

Everyone looked at Ye Ran and saw the hatred in her eyes. Ye Ran seemed to have lost her mind.

Ye Ran raised the baseball bat in her hand, wanting to hit her again.

A delinquent hurriedly stopped Ye Ran and said, “Stop it. If you continue, she’ll die!”

“Yes, you’re using too much strength.”

“Aren’t you going to teach her a lesson? You can’t kill her!”

“We just want money. We don’t want to go to jail!”

…

“Get lost!” Ye Ran roared crazily!

The delinquents were frightened and no longer dared to stop Ye Ran.

Ye Ran glared at Gao Lin with hatred written all over her face. She gripped the baseball bat tightly!
