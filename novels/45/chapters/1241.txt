1242 Be Careful

At this moment, Qiao Nian’s back was facing Takeda, so she didn’t notice his cheap shot at all.

However, Xiao Bao, who was outside, saw all of this. His heart was in his throat.

Mommy, be careful!

He had almost shouted it. Now he was so nervous that his entire body was covered in sweat.

Xiao Bao recalled the gun at his waist. This gun was made specially for him by his father. Its lethality could not compare to a real gun. Other than that, it was exactly the same as a real gun.

He picked up the pistol and aimed the scope directly at the bad guy.

Although he had practiced many times, his best result was only hitting the sixth ring.

This was a critical moment. If he missed, not only would he alert the enemy, but he would also put Mommy in danger.

Calm down.

He had to calm down now. He had to be careful.

The last time he didn’t save his father. Although it was just a hypothesis, he was so sad when he thought that his father might die.

But this time, he had to aim and save his mommy.

Xiao Bao’s attention was all on the gun.

Qiao Nian wanted to attack Jiang Yue, but she sensed a murderous intent behind her. Instinctively, she moved away.

In the next moment, gunshots rang out.

Actually, there were two gunshots. One was the sound of a silenced gun, and the other was the sound of a pistol.

Among them, a steel bullet from the silencer hit the back of Takeda’s hand. Takeda grinned in pain and fell to the side.

The other bullet hit Takeda’s right shoulder. He lay on the ground in a sorry state, blood staining the white carpet.

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She turned around and saw that the back of Takeda’s hand and shoulder were both seriously injured. She had only heard a loud gunshot just now. In other words, the other person had used a silencer.

At this moment, the door was kicked open!

Qiao Nian looked up, her eyes filled with smiles. Now, she was certain that one of the shots had been fired by Gu Zhou.

Dressed in a black suit, Gu Zhou barged in, looking like the Grim Reaper who had walked out of hell. His eyes were filled with killing intent.

When Xiao Bao, who had been sitting on the tree, saw Gu Zhou, his eyes lit up. He was extremely tempted and excited.

He had just hit the back of the baddie’s hand. If the back of the baddie’s hand had ten rings, then he had indeed hit the tenth ring now.

If his father knew that he was so amazing, he would definitely praise him for being a sharpshooter.

Since his second daddy was also here, Mommy would definitely not be in danger. Unfortunately, he could not acknowledge them now.

Butler Zhao had been guarding under the tree. He looked around uneasily, afraid that someone would notice him and Little Master.

If anything happened to Little Master, even if he had ten lives, it would not be enough to compensate.

Butler Zhao urged softly, “Little Master, let’s leave quickly. It won’t be good if others find out!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Xiao Bao looked at his mommy and daddy reluctantly, his heart filled with grievance. He couldn’t even acknowledge his parents now. So what if he took a few more glances at them?

Seeing that Xiao Bao was silent, Butler Zhao continued, “It’s really getting late. It’s really too dangerous outside. I’ll bring you back!”

“No, I still want to see Mommy and Daddy!” Xiao Bao said stubbornly.

Butler Zhao sighed helplessly. He could only continue to observe his surroundings in case there was any danger.

In the living room.

Jiang Yue looked at Gu Zhou’s figure in a daze. When Gu Zhou entered, he was bathed in sunlight. He looked even more handsome than before, making one feel that he was unreal.

A person who looked like an immortal walked in, but that person was not here for her!

Jiang Yue clenched her fists tightly, her nails digging into her palms. Even though her palms were bleeding, she didn’t seem to feel any pain.

Why did the heavens always stand by Qiao Nian’s side?

She had clearly met Brother Ah Zhou first, and she had been by his side for more than ten years. Why did Brother Ah Zhou like Qiao Nian, who had suddenly appeared?

She watched helplessly as Gu Zhou walked over to Qiao Nian. Her heart seemed to have been smashed to the ground, shattering into countless pieces.

Gu Zhou glanced at the people lying on the ground. His gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face, and his eyes were filled with concern. “Are you injured?”
