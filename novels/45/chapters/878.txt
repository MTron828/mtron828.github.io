879 Mrs. Gu, Thank You

When Xiao Shi fell asleep, she seemed to have a nightmare. Her brow was furrowed tightly.

Gu Zhou looked at Xiao Shi’s furrowed brows and his heart ached.

He wanted to stay by Xiao Shi’s side, but he had more important things to do now.

Gu Zhou looked down at Qiao Nian and said in a low voice, “Stay here and watch over Xiao Shi. It’s a mess down there. I’ll deal with it now.”

!!

Qiao Nian looked up at Gu Zhou and recalled how Song Man had heartlessly jumped off the building just now. Her eyes darkened slightly and she nodded. “Okay.”

“Nian’er.” Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian gently, his gaze complicated.

“Huh?” Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion. Perhaps it was because she had just thought of Song Man, but she was a little slow.

Gu Zhou bent down slightly and moved his thin lips to Qiao Nian’s forehead, leaving a light kiss. He met Qiao Nian’s mesmerizing eyes and said seriously, “Mrs. Gu, thank you.”

Gu Zhou’s voice was very soft, like a light feather brushing across Qiao Nian’s heart.

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned.

Mrs. Gu.

Gu Zhou had often called her that in the past. Every time he did, it was for the sake of appearances.

However, Gu Zhou didn’t say it for nothing. He was thanking her from the bottom of his heart.

Qiao Nian felt a little uncomfortable. She couldn’t put her finger on it, nor did she know how to respond.

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian’s charming face and left with a smile.

Chen Qing, who was standing at the side, was already looking like he ate dog food. He looked at Young Madam’s slightly red ears. Second Young Master was really too good at flirting.

His face was also flushed red. He felt that not many people could resist Second Young Master’s teasing.

Gu Zhou left with Chen Qing, leaving Qiao Nian and Xiao Shi alone in the ward.

Qiao Nian gradually lowered her gaze. Thinking of how Gu Zhou had kissed her forehead just now, and how Gu Zhou had thanked her as “Mrs. Gu”, she felt that it was a little sweet but also had an indescribable sense of disappointment.

Qiao Nian threw the shy scene to the back of her mind and looked worriedly at Xiao Shi, who was lying on the bed.

…

She was dreaming.

In her dream, she was still living in Hai Cheng with Song Man. The only difference was that Song Man was busy taking care of her every day and was very gentle with her. She would praise her for being smart when she knew how to memorize poems. She would also buy her a birthday cake on her birthday, put a party hat on her, and sing a birthday song for her.

On weekends, when Song Man was resting, she would hold her hand and bring her to the amusement park. She would also buy her cotton candy and balloons.

Every night, when she slept, Song Man would sit by the bed and tell her a bedtime story gently. She would even give her a goodnight kiss before she slept.

She felt very happy.

She only wanted to be so happy for the rest of her life.

However, one morning, Song Man kicked the door open and walked in fiercely.

Xiao Shi’s small happiness instantly disappeared. Before she could react, she was pulled up from the bed by Song Man.

The space started to change.

When Xiao Shi reacted, she saw her and Song Man standing on the top floor.

The gentleness and kindness on Song Man’s face disappeared, replaced by anger and ferocity.

“You’re just a tool!”

“I’ve been using you!”

“I don’t love you at all!”

Xiao Shi was stunned. She looked at Song Man in front of her in a daze, her tears falling uncontrollably. She stepped forward to grab Song Man’s clothes, but Song Man slapped her.

Xiao Shi’s face burned. She still grabbed Song Man’s clothes and said tearfully, “Mommy, don’t be like this. Don’t be angry. I’ll be obedient. I’ll take good care of you!”

“I hate you the most!” Song Man pushed Xiao Shi away and jumped down without hesitation.

Xiao Shi stood at the edge of the roof, holding the railing with her right hand and trying to grab Song Man’s clothes with her left.

However, her hand did not even touch the corner of Song Man’s shirt. Song Man fell to her death downstairs.

“Mommy!!!”

Xiao Shi screamed loudly. Her entire world was swallowed by blood, and she felt suffocated and uncomfortable.

“Mommy!”

Just as Xiao Shi was about to suffocate to death, she suddenly woke up and looked at the white ceiling in a daze. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The smell of disinfectant filled her nose.

Xiao Shi noticed that she was in the hospital. Only then did she realize that Qiao Nian had been sitting at the side, helping her wipe her forehead.
