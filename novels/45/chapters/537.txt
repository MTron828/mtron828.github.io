Chapter 538: I’m Rich Now

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

When Qiao Nian saw this news, the corners of her lips curled up uncontrollably, and the smile on her face grew wider.

There was a hint of a scheme in the message, but she didn’t resent it at all.

Don’t tell me this fellow’s old trick is for her to pay the bill!

Not only was Qiao Nian not disgusted, but she was also very excited. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

This was her unique relationship with Gu Qi.

Qiao Nian moved her fingers and typed a message.

“Are you treating me?”

“Of course. I’m very rich now.”

For some reason, Qiao Nian felt like she was a tyrant’s kept woman. With a smile in her eyes, she said, “Alright, I’m looking forward to it!”

Gu Qi did not reply.

Qiao Nian glanced at the time on her phone. It was two in the afternoon here. It should be at five in the morning in An City.

“Little Qi, have you not been sleeping? Or have you just woken up?”

After Qiao Nian sent these messages, her heart felt empty.

Logically speaking, she shouldn’t have asked. However, when she thought of Gu Qi’s lonely back, her heart ached.

After a few more minutes, Gu Qi sent her a message.

“I can’t sleep.”

Qiao Nian’s heart ached inexplicably.

Gu Qi was still so young, but he could not sleep because of his worries.

He should not have to endure so much at such a young age.

Qiao Nian’s expression darkened as she read those words. Since Gu Qi was unwilling to say more, she couldn’t ask further. However, she couldn’t help but think about him.

At this moment, Gu Qi sent another message.

“Auntie, I’m going to bed!”

Qiao Nian moved her fingers and hurriedly replied, “Good night. Have a good dream!”

Qiao Nian turned off her phone, her eyes filled with worry and sadness. However, she quickly hid it.

At this moment, Chen Qing brought Lu Zhu’s medicine back.

Qiao Nian put her phone into her bag. Suddenly, she felt a gaze on her face. She turned her head and met Gu Zhou’s dark brown eyes.

His eyes were like a deep pool of water. It was easy to sink into them.

Of course, Gu Zhou noticed the change in Qiao Nian’s expression. He frowned slightly. Qiao Nian seemed to have many secrets.

When Qiao Nian saw Gu Zhou, she was reminded of Gu Qi’s inhumane and immoral father.

From the fact that Gu Qi had insomnia at such a young age, Gu Qi’s father must not have taken good care of him. A layer of coldness appeared in her eyes.

Such parents who gave birth but did not raise their children well were simply unworthy of being human.

Before coming to MY, she had been looking for her family all over the world like Gu Qi.

She had already found her family, but Gu Qi had yet to find his.

When she returned to An City, the first thing she did was to help Gu Qi find his biological mother.

She hoped that Gu Qi could find his mother as soon as possible so that he could experience his parents’ love and grow up in an environment filled with love.

“Second Master, we’ve completed the discharge procedures and the car is parked outside the hospital. We can leave now.”

“Yes.”

Hearing this, Qiao Nian hurriedly got up, wanting to help her brother get up from the bed.

But Gu Zhou was one step ahead of her.

Qiao Nian could only stand by the side and say nothing more.

Chen Qing glanced at the three people by the bed. He felt that the three of them were in a very dangerous situation.

It seemed that they had to return to An City as soon as possible. At that time, Second Young Madam and Mr. Lu would be separated, and this strange atmosphere would no longer exist.

Soon they were at the airport.

When they boarded the plane, Lu Zhu took his medicine and leaned back in his chair with his eyes closed. He was not in a good mood.

He wanted to sleep and recuperate, but his mind was in a mess and he could not fall asleep for a long time.
