Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Lu Zhu grabbed Lu Rao’s hand and clenched it tightly. He shook his head gently and said, “I’m fine. There’s no need to go to the hospital. Chen Shi, speed up. I want to go home early.”

Lu Rao sensed the strength in Lu Zhu’s hand and knew that he was fine now. He heaved a sigh of relief, but looked at Lu Zhu in confusion. “Brother, where exactly are you feeling unwell?”

Lu Zhu looked straight into Lu Rao’s eyes and said bluntly, “I miss Sugar.”

Hearing Lu Zhu’s words, the worry in Lu Rao’s eyes gradually disappeared. A trace of heavy thought rose in his eyes. He frowned and asked, “Why are you suddenly thinking of her again?”

“Ah Rao, I mean, if…” Lu Zhu opened his mouth and thought for a while, then asked,” If Sugar is still alive, what do you plan to do with her? ”

Lu Rao’s eyes lit up, then slowly dimmed. Sugar was no longer there.

Although Big Brother said that it was only a if, just thinking about it made his entire heart feel warm. It was even warmer than the sun today.

“Of course I’ll spoil her. I want her to live a happy life!” Lu Rao said with a smile.

Moreover, he wanted to make up for the twenty years he couldn’t dote on Sugar.

Lu Zhu sat at the side. His heart skipped a beat and he replied softly, “Okay.”

Lu Rao did not think too much about it. He just felt that his brother might have missed Sugar too much, which was why he said such things.

Seeing that his brother was fine, he relaxed.

Lu Rao recalled how his brother had gone to MY this time. His expression darkened as he said, “Brother, did you go there because you believe in the Moon Goddess?”

Lu Zhu had already found Sugar. He was no longer as persistent as he had been with the Moon Goddess. His voice was much gentler as he said, “I just believe in fate. Perhaps everything is destined!”

Hearing Lu Zhu’s words, Lu Rao narrowed his eyes.

Destined? DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Was his adorable little sister destined to leave him?

Lu Rao’s mood instantly darkened. He clenched his fists tightly, the veins on the back of his hands bulging.

He turned his head to the side, unwilling to think about this anymore. He leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes to rest.

Seeing Lu Rao like this, Lu Zhu hurriedly took out his phone and sent Qiao Nian a text. “Okay, wait for me to arrange a time!”

When Qiao Nian received the text, she almost couldn’t control her smile!

She took a few deep breaths to calm herself down.

Ah Rao was her third brother.

She was really looking forward to seeing how Third Brother would react when she reunited with him.

Just as Qiao Nian was thinking about this, she arrived at the Gu family villa.

The Gu family’s villa was built at the edge of the mountain. Autumn had just arrived, and the entire mountain was covered in maple trees. Everything was red.

It was 11 AM in An City.

When the sun shone on the mountain behind the Gu family’s villa, it was magnificent and made one feel as if they were in a fairyland.

Matriarch Gu had already known that they were coming back. She had been waiting at the door since early in the morning.

The autumn wind was chilly. Even so, Matriarch Gu did not return to her room.

In the past, when Nian Nian and Ah Zhou were both at home, and Zhao Qian and Jiang Yue accompanied her, she didn’t feel lonely.

But now, Jiang Yue had already left. She was more or less not used to it.

Sigh.

She had raised Jiang Yue for more than ten years. This relationship could not be forgotten overnight.

Jiang Yue was not around, and Zhao Qian was busy overseas. She did not want Zhao Qian to worry about her, so she did not let Zhao Qian waste time by her side.

She could only entrust all her feelings to Nian Nian and Ah Zhou.

Although they had only left home for a few days, she felt as if many years had passed.
