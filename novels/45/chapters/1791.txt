Chapter 1792 - 1792 Why Is It Him?

There were not many people around the president, and he was surrounded on all sides. If he took a wrong step, he would be eaten up by Mark’s men.

It was him who had complied with the last president’s last wish and eliminated all difficulties to support the president.

But after the president took over, he actually wanted to kill him.

“B*stard, give me your life!” Cui Huai’s eyes were red with anger as he shouted.

Cui Huai’s movements attracted the attention of many people. Everyone looked at Cui Huai.

The president looked over and saw a man covered in blood standing not far away. His eyes were fierce, like a ferocious beast that wanted to kill him at all times.

The president looked slightly stunned.

The reason Mark’s people wanted to capture and kill him was because they wanted to get benefits from Mark. However, those people seemed to think that Mark wanted him captured alive more.

The man in front of him seemed to be different from the others. He seemed to be filled with hatred for him.

However, the president did not have time to think too much at this moment, because that person’s knife was almost in front of him. The president quickly raised the knife in his hand and blocked it without hesitation.

What puzzled the president was that the person in front of him seemed to be very familiar with his moves.

The president looked at the unfamiliar face. He was completely sure he didn’t know the man.

The president’s guards still wanted to help the president deal with Cui Huai, but they were quickly dealt with by Cui Huai.

At this moment, the president’s situation was getting more and more difficult. He had no chance to attack now and could only resist passively.

The president looked at the unfamiliar face in front of him. For some reason, it felt familiar, but he was sure he had never seen this person before.

“Do you think my moves are very familiar?” Cui Huai smiled coldly. He seemed to have already seen through the president’s confusion. His eyes gradually turned cold as he gritted his teeth and said, “Back then, I used these moves to make you sit steadily in the president’s seat.”

When the President heard Cui Huai’s words, his expression changed slightly. Someone who could say such a thing must have contributed greatly back then.

He remembered every one of his contributors clearly, but this was the first time he had seen this face.

The president frowned and asked, “Who the hell are you?”

Cui Huai stopped what he was doing. He raised his hand and took off the mask on his face, revealing a face filled with hatred. He gritted his teeth and asked, “Now you know who I am, right?”ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The president’s pupils dilated uncontrollably as he looked at the person in front of him in disbelief. Just as he was about to speak, he did not expect Cui Huai to take this opportunity to point a knife at his throat.

Why was it him?

How could it be Cui Si?

At this moment, there was no one left beside the president. He stood alone and had no time to defend himself. He could only watch as the knife approached him.

The president looked at Cui Si in confusion. He did not understand why Cui Si was here. Back then, Mark had come to him with Cui Si’s head. Why was Cui Si still alive?

When the guards who rushed over from the side saw the critical situation on the president’s side, their expressions changed.

“Protect the president!”

“Mr. President, be careful!”

Everyone’s hearts were in their throats. They were worried that the president would be buried here.

At this critical moment, everyone ran towards the president, hoping to protect him.

A figure flashed in front of them. Before they could react, the figure had already rushed to the president’s side and pulled him aside. He did not forget to block Cui Huai’s long knife with his back.

Just like that, the long knife pierced into that person’s body, and blood splattered.

The president came back to his senses and looked at the person in front of him. He was slightly stunned and quickly supported him. He looked at his face and said, “So it’s you!”

Although he did not know this person’s name, he knew that he was someone close to Mr. Gu. He had seen this person a few times before, and this person seemed to rarely speak.

He still remembered Gu Zhou calling this person’s name. It seemed to be…
Chen Qing.
