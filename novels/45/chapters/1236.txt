1237 Not Dirty

How was she dirty?

She was clearly not dirty at all!

Jiang Yue was already overwhelmed by anger. She looked at Qiao Nian with disgust and said angrily, “Qiao Nian, you’re too good at beautifying yourself. You still think that you’re high up in the air? You think too highly of yourself. You said that I’m dirty. How am I dirty? I’m clearly doing well now. How many people envy me? You’re just jealous that I’m doing better than you!”

At this point, Jiang Yue stood up and looked at Qiao Nian coldly. “Have you forgotten how you married into the Gu family back then?” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“You’re a young lady of the Qiao family who’s not doted on. You married in place of someone else. You were used to get rid of bad luck.” Jiang Yue clenched her fists tightly, the veins on the back of her hands bulging ferociously. Her voice rose as well. “Don’t you think you’re so worthless that you’re even marrying in place of someone else. To put it nicely, you’re marrying in place of your sister. To put it harshly, you’re stealing your sister’s boyfriend.”

The more Jiang Yue spoke, the more emotional she became. “You’re just a woman who stole my brother-in-law. How dare you talk about and integrity in front of me? Do you really think you’re something? You don’t even know what morals are, yet you still have the cheek to stand on the moral high ground and criticize others. What a hypocrite!”

Qiao Nian looked at Jiang Yue’s hysterical expression and smiled, as if she was watching a clown perform. Her red lips parted slightly, and her voice was cold. “If I’m not wrong, the burn mark on your neck is caused by wax!”

Jiang Yue was slightly stunned, and the blood drained from her face. In a panic, she pulled her collar over, trying to hide the burn mark on her neck. Her eyes were a little distant.

Seeing Jiang Yue like this, Qiao Nian said lightly, “I really didn’t expect you to be so good at playing S&M! It must be exciting to be a M!”

Qiao Nian paused for a moment and continued, “The S&Ms that are truly willing parties know how to play with props, but both sides know their limits. They won’t leave any marks on their bodies. The burn mark on your neck probably won’t disappear!”

“Shut up!” Jiang Yue shouted in exasperation.

Seeing Jiang Yue fly into a rage out of humiliation, Qiao Nian sighed slightly and continued, “So you think your dog-like life is good. Alright, as long as you think it’s good. I’m not going to take away your blessings. After all, I’m not interested in being someone else’s plaything…”

“Shut up! I told you to shut up!” Jiang Yue shouted like a lunatic.

Her mind flashed with what Boss Jin had done to her.

She had been whipped by him!

She was forced to crawl on the ground like a dog!

He hung her up!

He had dripped a candle on her!

…

Those humiliating memories instantly surged into her mind.

She felt that she could just be a dog in front of Boss Jin. That way, he could still face everything around him calmly.

However, Qiao Nian’s mockery made her realize that there were others who knew about the humiliation she had suffered.

Jiang Yue pursed her lips tightly, panting heavily. She looked at Qiao Nian with red-rimmed eyes, already furious to the extreme.

Seeing that Jiang Yue was acting like a mad dog, Qiao Nian didn’t say anything. She just looked at Jiang Yue quietly.

It took Jiang Yue a long time to calm down. She tucked her hair behind her ear and her gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. She said sarcastically, “Qiao Nian, it’s all thanks to you that I’ve become like this. It’s you! You’re the vicious woman who chased me out of the house and ruined my life and my face, leaving me nowhere to stay! Now, you know how to put on an act, heh!”

Qiao Nian looked at Jiang Yue, who was acting like a rabid dog. She felt that Jiang Yue was very pitiful. She said calmly, “Jiang Yue, the reason why you’ve become like this has nothing to do with me. This is all your fault.”

“You’re talking nonsense!”

“You and Zhao Qian were both raised by Grandma. Grandma dotes on you even more.” Qiao Nian looked at Jiang Yue’s face, and Zhao Qian’s face flashed across her mind. “She’s studying fashion design in Paris now. She has things she wants to do, and her dreams. Isn’t her life better than yours now?”
