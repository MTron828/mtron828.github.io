974 Good Feeling

Just as He Cheng was about to approach Miss Lu, he suddenly heard her phone ring. He was so frightened that he immediately turned around and stood on the other side of the tree.

“Fourth Brother!” Lu Qi had a bright smile on her face. When she picked up the phone, she smiled brightly.

“Didn’t you say that you don’t have class this afternoon? Why aren’t you back yet?”

On the phone, Lu Jiang’s voice was filled with concern.

Lu Qi looked around but did not see a taxi. She smiled and said, “I was preparing the thesis information in the library in the afternoon. I’ll be back soon!”

“Shall I pick you up?”

“I’m not a three-year-old child. I can go home myself!” Lu Qi couldn’t help but laugh. “Fourth Brother, I’m not a child. I can take a taxi home myself!”

“Alright, I’ll give you a surprise!” Lu Jiang said with a smile.

“Surprise?” Lu Qi’s eyes lit up. She asked with interest, “Brother, are you going to bring me a Fourth Sister-in-law?”

Lu Jiang was speechless.

Lu Qi did not hear Lu Jiang’s answer. Her heart jumped to her throat. She asked, “Brother, is there a fourth sister-in-law?”

In the past, Fourth Brother would have said that she was making a scene, but this time, Fourth Brother didn’t say anything. That meant that Fourth Brother had taken a liking to a girl.

Qiao Nian’s face suddenly flashed across Lu Qi’s mind. In the past, she had wanted Qiao Nian to be her Fourth Sister-in-law. When she first saw Qiao Nian, she had felt a sense of familiarity. She couldn’t help but want to get close to her.

Sigh!

Unfortunately, Qiao Nian was Brother Ah Zhou’s wife.

“No.” Lu Jiang smiled.

“Really?” Lu Qi asked again. “Then why were you hesitating just now?”

“I was reading some information just now.” As Lu Jiang spoke, the image of the girl who had almost been sexually harassed that night flashed across his mind. The girl was very beautiful, and he couldn’t help but take a few more glances.

“It’s a pity that the Fourth Sister-in-law in my heart has already married Brother Ah Zhou. Otherwise, I really want her to be with you!” Lu Qi sighed sadly.

“Are you asking me to poach her?” Lu Jiang asked with interest.

“That won’t do. Brother Ah Zhou treasures her so much!” Lu Qi shook her head and said impatiently.

“Lu Qi, actually, you should rush Big Brother first. He’s already in his thirties, but he’s still single.” As Lu Jiang spoke, he looked up at Lu Zhu, who was sitting not far away. Seeing Lu Zhu looking at him, he smiled smugly.

“Indeed. Then I’ll tell Grandma later. The few of you should find a girlfriend,” Lu Qi said after some serious thought.

When Lu Jiang heard Lu Qi’s words, he couldn’t help but laugh. This little girl was young, but she knew how to worry about him.

After hanging up, Lu Jiang looked at Lu Zhu in confusion and asked, “Brother Ah Zhou is married?”

Lu Zhu’s expression froze for a moment before he asked, “Huh?”

“I heard from Lu Qi that she seems to especially like Brother Ah Zhou’s wife.” Lu Jiang found it really hard to imagine that Gu Zhou, who was afraid of women, was actually married!

Was the sun really not rising from the west?

After Lu Jiang finished speaking, he inadvertently saw Lu Zhu’s slightly curved lips. A trace of confusion flashed in his eyes.

It seemed that not only did Lu Qi like Mrs. Gu, but even Big Brother liked her a lot.

Or had he misunderstood? Big Brother only smiled because of Lu Qi.

“She’s very good.” Lu Zhu’s lips curved up slightly, his eyes filled with gentleness.

Lu Jiang was stunned.

He had never seen his brother smile like this when he mentioned the opposite sex.

Lu Jiang had a strange feeling in his heart, but he didn’t know what it was. After some thought, he said, “Brother, you admire Mrs. Gu very much.”

“Yes,” Lu Zhu said without hesitation.

Lu Jiang thought to himself, “Is it really good for you to be thinking about a married woman?”

Lu Zhu seemed to have read Lu Jiang’s mind. He smiled meaningfully and said, “Don’t worry, you’ll admire her and have a good impression of her!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Lu Jiang thought to himself, “How can you have a good impression of a married woman?”

Could Mrs. Gu be a vixen?

Both Big Brother and Sister had designs on her.

With this thought in mind, Lu Jiang smiled and asked, “Brother, do you have a photo of Mrs. Gu?”
