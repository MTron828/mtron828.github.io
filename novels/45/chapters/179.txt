Chapter 180 Setup

Gazing at the bright smile on Qiao Nian’s face, Gu Zhou was momentarily dazed.

Suddenly, the car braked sharply.

Only then did Gu Zhou come back to his senses. He frowned, turning to look at Chen Qing unhappily. “What happened?”

Chen Qing unbuckled his seatbelt and looked straight ahead, saying, “I’m sorry, Second Young Master. I almost bumped into someone just now!”

Gu Zhou lowered his gaze and said nothing

more.

From time to time, Qiao Nian took out her phone to check the time. When she felt that it was about time, she gave Qiao Shan a call.

When Qiao Shan saw that it was Qiao Nian calling, he was momentarily surprised. He couldn’t believe that Qiao Nian would voluntarily contact him. He picked up the phone and said uncertainly, “Who is it?”

“Dad.”

When Qiao Shan heard Qiao Nian call him “Dad”, his lips curved up involuntarily.

Previously, Qiao Nian had pretended to want to cut ties with her family. Yet, she was still respectfully addressing him as “Dad” when calling him. Perhaps Qiao Nian had suffered a lot in the Gu family. Now, she had sought him out for help to back her up.

Qiao Shan was extremely pleased with himself, but he put on a calm facade and asked coldly, “What do you want?”

When Qiao Nian heard Qiao Shan’s voice, a trace of disdain flashed in her eyes. She said, “Previously, didn’t you say that you wanted the Suranne Grass?”

Qiao Shan raised his eyebrow. His guess was correct. In order to cement her position in the Gu family, Qiao Nian was willing to give him even the precious Suranne Grass.

However, Qiao Shan decided to continue putting on an act. Pretending to be confused, he asked, “You value the Suranne Grass so much. Are you willing to give it to me?”

Qiao Nian smiled and said, “How can you say that? You’re my father. What’s mine should be yours, shouldn’t it?”

Gu Zhou was speechless.

Chen Qing was speechless. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Qiao Nian smiled again and said gently, “Dad, no matter what, I’m still your biological daughter. I went too far last time. And now that Brother has returned… I think we haven’t even had a meal together as a family!”

When Qiao Shan heard Qiao Nian’s words, he was even more certain that Qiao Nian had been suffering in the Gu family. He was extremely pleased with himself, but he still pretended to be calm.

Qiao Shan coughed and said in a low voice, “You’re young, so I won’t hold it against you It’s not too late for you to reflect upon your mistakes. Have you been suffering in the Gu family?”

Gu Zhou frowned.

A trace of anger flashed across Qiao Nian’s face. Her eyes turned cold, but her voice was as calm as ever. “No.”

“If you had been so obedient from the beginning, your mother would have been as gentle with you as she was with your sister,” Qiao Shan said meaningfully.

A trace of disdain flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes. The coldness in her eyes grew clearer and clearer. Her thin lips moved slightly. “You’re right. I was young and insensible in the past.”

Qiao Shan sat down on the sofa. Hearing Qiao Nian admit her mistake, he felt even more satisfied. He continued, “Not only the Suranne Grass, but also the other expensive medicinal herbs you’ve grown… You should keep those in our backyard, not in the Gu residence. By the way, teach your sister how to cultivate these plants. In the future, these will be a Qiao family skillset. It will bring glory to our family!”

Qiao Nian felt her stomach churn. She suppressed her nausea. She was looking forward to seeing how Qiao Shan would react later on.

Qiao Nian took a deep breath and said, “I’ve already sent Mom the location. She’ll go over first. Take Brother and Sister with you. We’ll talk when we get to the hotel. I’ll send you the room number as well.”

With that, Qiao Nian hung up without waiting for Qiao Shan to reply. If she heard another word from Qiao Shan, she would probably throw up.

Qiao Nian took out her phone and typed out another code. This code could make Su Xue’s phone temporarily lose signal.

Gu Zhou’s gaze fell on the code Qiao Nian was typing. His eyes darkened as he memorized every character.
