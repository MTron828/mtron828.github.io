1495 Get lost!

Annie had just taken two steps when the man seemed to sense her and turned to look at her.

When she looked at his side profile and eyes just now, she only felt that they were beautiful and charming. She couldn’t help but be immersed in them.

But when the man looked at her, she felt that her heart had already been taken away by his eyes.

How could there be such a good-looking man in this world?

It wasn’t easy for Annie to move her gaze from his eyes to his lips.

His lips were slightly thin, and when he pursed them tightly, they gave off a sense of asceticism.

Such a good-looking person really looked like he had walked out of a painting.

Annie walked towards the man and met his cold and displeased gaze.

Annie’s lips curved up slightly. This man was already her snack. How could she be frightened by a look from him?

Annie raised her hand to tuck her hair behind her ear and smiled at the man in front of her. She narrowed her eyes slightly, revealing an enchanting and alluring posture.

Annie elegantly raised her skirt and calmly walked up to the man. Her eyes revealed a trace of charm, and her voice was a little bewitching. “Sir, it’s very lonely to look at the scenery alone, right? Why don’t I watch it with you?”

As she spoke, Annie reached out to grab Gu Zhou’s shirt.

Gu Zhou turned his body and avoided Annie’s hand. His expression darkened, and his voice was completely cold. “Get lost!”

With that, Gu Zhou turned around and left without hesitation.

Annie looked down at her empty hands. She hadn’t expected this man to reject her.

Interesting.

Annie’s lips curved up slightly. Although her status in Europe was a little inferior to that fool Lina, many men were pursuing her relentlessly.

A trace of a smile flickered in her eyes. This man must have tried to seduce her in such a sultry way.

With this thought in mind, Annie quickly walked behind Gu Zhou and was about to hug him from behind.

However, before her hand could touch Gu Zhou, he turned around and stood at the side. She almost missed.

Smiling, Annie reached out to touch Gu Zhou’s face, but Gu Zhou grabbed her arm.

Annie’s lips curved up slightly. Just as she was about to speak, she felt a pain in her wrist. She immediately frowned.

Annie looked up at the man and met his fierce eyes. She gasped and said loudly, “How dare you? I’m the most beautiful Princess Annie in Europe. How dare you attack me? Do you want to die?”

After she finished speaking, she thought that the man would let go of her hand, but he tightened his grip.

Annie frowned in pain. She couldn’t help but cry out. This was the first time she had seen such a cold man.

She was the princess of Europe and had always been high up in the air. With a casual crook of her finger, many men would pounce on her.

Why was this man so indifferent to her?

Annie was puzzled.

Gu Zhou looked at Annie’s greedy gaze, his eyes filled with disgust. He tightened his grip.

Crack!

With the crisp sound of bones, Annie screamed in pain. “Ah!”

Annie’s face instantly turned pale. She looked at her wrist, which had been twisted to a very strange angle by Gu Zhou. She looked at Gu Zhou in pain. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Gu Zhou shook her off mercilessly.

Annie lost her balance and fell to the ground in a sorry state. Her gown was stained with mud. She looked at Gu Zhou angrily.

Not only did this man ignore her seduction, but he also hit her so hard even though he knew that she was a princess.

The raging fire burned Annie’s rationality. She looked at Gu Zhou angrily and immediately stood up. “How dare you hurt me!”
