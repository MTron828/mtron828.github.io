Chapter 640: Jealousy

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Gu Zhou stood up slightly and walked towards the desk. He glanced at the documents on the table and slowly placed them back into the drawer. “Oh.”

Qiao Nian was a little surprised. She hadn’t expected Gu Zhou to be so calm.

Wasn’t Gu Zhou curious at all about what Grandma had told her?

Qiao Nian stroked the snake’s head and continued, “I didn’t expect Old Master Lu and Old Master Gu to be comrades-in-arms. This kind of life-and-death friendship is really enviable. No wonder the relationship between the two families is getting better and better.”

“Yes,” Gu Zhou replied indifferently. He looked up slightly at Qiao Nian. Seeing that Qiao Nian looked interested, he said, “If you have anything to ask, just ask. Don’t beat around the bush.”

“I heard that you met the eldest daughter of the Lu family when you were young?”

Gu Zhou narrowed his phoenix-like eyes and sat lazily on the office chair. He casually picked up a fountain pen and spun it around. A trace of a smile flickered in his eyes. “I was engaged to her in the past.”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. She hadn’t expected Gu Zhou to tell her about this.

The pen in Gu Zhou’s hand stopped spinning. He placed the pen on the table and walked towards the sofa. He walked up to Qiao Nian and looked down at her.

“You—”

Gu Zhou bent down slightly, his face approaching Qiao Nian’s. He raised his eyebrows slightly, his voice sexy and hoarse. “Mrs. Gu, are you jealous?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Qiao Nian’s ears turned red uncontrollably.

What nonsense was he spouting? She wasn’t talking about this at all, okay?

“If I treat her as my younger sister, will Mrs. Gu be at ease?” Gu Zhou asked seriously. His voice was low and magnetic.

Qiao Nian only wanted to ask if Gu Zhou had met the eldest daughter of the Lu family, but with Gu Zhou’s answer, she was too embarrassed to continue asking.

If she continued to ask, Gu Zhou might not tell her the answer. Instead, he might think that she was jealous.

She felt that she was not on the same channel as Gu Zhou. Some things would only get worse and worse.

“Why don’t we go to the Lu family together the day after tomorrow?”

“Hm.”

Qiao Nian didn’t expect Gu Zhou to agree so quickly. She wanted to get up, but Gu Zhou was a little too close.

For some reason, Qiao Nian recalled what Gu Qi had said to her.

Gu Qi had said that Gu Zhou had admitted to liking her.

She knew very well that Gu Zhou said this because he wanted Gu Qi to accept her as his stepmother.

However, her heart was still beating wildly.

Qiao Nian hurriedly threw those messy thoughts to the back of her mind. She thought of Chen Qing, who was standing at the door. She looked up at Gu Zhou and said, “Don’t let Chen Qing go out to do anything in the future. Let him stay by your side. With him by your side, he can take good care of you.”

“Aren’t you still at home?” Gu Zhou asked, clearly seeing the worry in Qiao Nian’s eyes.

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she was stunned. For a moment, she didn’t know how to answer.

Before she could speak, she heard Gu Zhou say, “And you’ll always be by my side, won’t you?”

Qiao Nian’s heart was beating faster and faster, as if it was about to break free from her chest. She didn’t understand what was wrong with Gu Zhou today. Why would he say such a thing?

Gu Zhou looked at Qiao Nian’s stunned expression and frowned slightly. His eyes were cold as he said, “Not only are you my wife, but you’re also my private doctor!”

So she had misunderstood.

Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. Seeing Gu Zhou straighten his back and move his butt to the side, she stood up and looked up at Gu Zhou, explaining, “I go out sometimes too. Let Chen Qing stay by your side.”

“Hm.”

Qiao Nian continued, “It’s getting late. I’m going to tell Little Qi a fairy tale. I have to go out tonight. Remember to ask Chen Qing to accompany you.”

Gu Zhou’s eyes darkened as he responded casually.

He didn’t ask Qiao Nian where she was going. Instead, he sat on the sofa and watched as Qiao Nian left the study.

His eyes narrowed slightly, his gaze becoming more and more dazed.

Qiao Nian had just left the study when Chen Qing walked in.
