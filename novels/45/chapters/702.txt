Chapter 703: Hyacinth

“Grandma, this is Sister’s blessing bag.” Lu Qi smiled at Matriarch Lu and said gently.

“Alright, alright. Thank you, Miss Qiao!” Matriarch Lu looked up at Qiao Nian and said sincerely.

Qiao Nian smiled and didn’t say anything.

Lu Zhu and Lu Nian looked at Qiao Nian with heartache.

Their Sugar actually embroidered a blessing bag for herself.

How sad must their Sugar have been when she embroidered the blessing bun!

Matriarch Lu opened the box. When she saw the blessing bag inside, her eyes lit up and her lips curved up slightly. This was the first time she had smiled today.

Lu Qi was standing beside Matriarch Lu. She looked at the blessing bag and exclaimed, “This blessing bag is really beautiful. It’s actually a hyacinth. It’s beautiful!”

The hyacinths of various colors on the blessing bag intertwined. They were lifelike and bloomed with vitality, making one unable to help but take a few more glances.

Not far away, Jiang Yue leaned over slightly. When she saw the blessing bag, she was slightly surprised.

Last night, when she sneaked into the Gu family villa, she had wanted to destroy the blessing bag Qiao Nian had prepared.

But she couldn’t find it after searching for a long time.

She finally understood now because Qiao Nian had made the blessing bag look like a bouquet.

When she entered the embroidery room, she immediately saw the blessing bag. However, at that time, she thought that it was a bouquet of flowers, so she didn’t take it to heart.

She searched the embroidery room but could not find the blessing bag. She could only leave.

Jiang Yue saw Lu Qi carefully take out the blessing bag. If she didn’t know that this was a blessing bag, she would really think that Lu Qi was carrying a bouquet of flowers.

She hadn’t expected Qiao Nian’s embroidery to be so good.

Matriarch Lu looked at the blessing bag lovingly, then her gaze fell on Qiao Nian’s face. She asked, “Miss Qiao, your embroidery skills are really good. I wonder how long you’ve been practicing?”

“I’ve been learning embroidery since I was young,” Qiao Nian said honestly.

Jiang Yue’s gaze was fixed on the blessing bag in Lu Qi’s hand, and she pursed her lips tightly.

She couldn’t let Qiao Nian steal the limelight.

With this thought in mind, Jiang Yue looked up at Qiao Nian and frowned. She asked in disbelief, “Sister Qiao Nian, how could you embroider hyacinths for the eldest daughter of the Lu family? You even specially embroidered a large number of blue, pink, and purple hyacinths?”

Seeing that everyone was looking at her, Jiang Yue mustered her courage and said, “Don’t you know their symbolism?”

Everyone saw the concern in Jiang Yue’s eyes and heard her words. They thought that the hyacinths were not suitable for the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

Lu Qi looked at Jiang Yue in confusion and frowned slightly. “Doesn’t a hyacinth symbolize purity and flawlessness?”

When Matriarch Lu heard Lu Qi’s words, she nodded slightly. Her eldest granddaughter was the purest and most flawless person in the world.

When Jiang Yue heard Lu Qi’s words, she shook her head gently and said helplessly, “Pure and flawless. That’s just the flower symbolism of a white hyacinth. Actually, different colors of hyacinth represent different meanings. Some flower meanings have good meanings, but some…”

When Matriarch Lu heard Jiang Yue’s words, she frowned and said in confusion, “If they’re all hyacinths, what’s the difference?”

When Jiang Yue heard Matriarch Lu’s words, she didn’t speak immediately. Instead, she looked at Qiao Nian pitifully and asked in a low voice, “Sister Qiao Nian, why don’t you tell everyone?” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Qiao Nian’s gaze fell on the blessing bag. She couldn’t be bothered to waste her breath on someone like Jiang Yue.

Song Yu’s eyes flashed. Seeing that the atmosphere in the room was a little awkward, she said, “Jiang Yue, since you know their symbolism, tell me!”

Jiang Yue sighed slightly and said, “The purple hyacinth represents sadness, jealousy, melancholy love, apology, and regret. The blue hyacinth represents melancholy because of love, and also represents chastity. The pink hyacinth represents admiration.”

Seeing that everyone’s expressions were ugly, Jiang Yue said solemnly, “I just don’t think these are suitable for the eldest daughter of the Lu family.”

Matriarch Lu’s expression turned even uglier. Her expression was so dark that ink could drip from it.
