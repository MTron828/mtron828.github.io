Chapter 533: Nian Nian?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

At this moment, the atmosphere in the ward became strange.

Gu Zhou was using this method to warn him that Qiao Nian was just his sister-in-law. He was telling him not to have any ill intentions towards Qiao Nian.

The mood was getting grimmer.

Qiao Nian naturally realized that something was wrong with the two of them. She glanced at them one by one, instantly feeling flustered.

How could she break this stalemate?

Qiao Nian was about to step forward when there was a knock on the door.

The knock sounded sharp in this strange atmosphere.

Lu Zhu calmly took the medicine from Qiao Nian’s hand. His gaze landed on the door of the ward, and he said calmly, “Please come in.”

Chen Qing pushed the door open and entered. He instantly sensed that the three of them did not look too good and realized that the atmosphere in the ward was very awkward.

It seemed that Second Young Master still cared a lot about Second Young Madam addressing Mr. Lu as Brother Zhu.

Chen Qing coughed lightly and said respectfully, “Second Young Master Sha has already said that Mr. Lu is recovering well and can be discharged this afternoon.”

Gu Zhou heaved a sigh of relief. His eyes were deep as he said, “Since Brother Zhu has recovered, go and help Brother Zhu with the discharge procedures. Contact the country hospitals first. When the time comes, arrange for the best private doctor for Brother Zhu.”

Chen Qing was speechless.

Brother Zhu?

Chen Qing could now tell that the Second Young Master was very dissatisfied. He took a deep breath. It seemed that the Second Young Master was very possessive.

Second Young Master was openly declaring his sovereignty now. He was also telling Mr. Lu that he would help Second Young Madam return the favor.

Gu Zhou frowned slightly and said unhappily, “Aren’t you going?”

Chen Qing gasped and quickly nodded. He quickly fled the ward, not forgetting to close the door.

As long as he wasn’t ordered to stay here and stack up the tiles, anything was fine.

Inside the ward.

Qiao Nian wanted to tell Gu Zhou that she could take care of Brother Zhu alone, but when she met Gu Zhou’s cold eyes, she hesitated and didn’t speak.

She sensed that Gu Zhou was unhappy this morning, but now she instantly understood everything.

Gu Zhou did not know about her relationship with her brother. When he saw how carefully she took care of her brother, he was definitely unhappy.

This unhappiness had nothing to do with love. He simply felt that his pride was hurt. He was also possessive of her due to her status as Mrs. Gu.

After all, the two of them were now married. He was her husband.

Qiao Nian lowered her eyes slightly. Should she tell Gu Zhou about her relationship with her brother?

Qiao Nian’s gaze landed on her brother’s face. Seeing that her brother had no intention of saying anything, it seemed that he had his own thoughts. It wasn’t convenient for her to say anything.

She could only pretend not to see Gu Zhou’s unhappy expression and silently wipe the water off the table with a tissue.

Gu Zhou sat beside the bed. He crossed his legs and leaned back against the chair. His posture was cold and noble. His gaze landed on Lu Zhu’s face and he said softly, “Brother Zhu, thank you for taking care of Nian Nian during this period of time.”

Qiao Nian stopped wiping the table.

Nian Nian?

She felt instantly sick.

When did Gu Zhou change the way he addressed her? Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

This form of address was a little too intimate.

If she didn’t know that he was Gu Zhou now, she would have suspected that Zhou Zhou had come out.

This man was so protective of his dignity!

At this moment, Lu Zhu was also slightly stunned. This was the first time he had heard Gu Zhou call his Sugar that.

In the past, every time Gu Zhou mentioned Qiao Nian to him, he would always call her Qiao Nian. His attitude was distant, and he didn’t sound close to her at all.

He had a good relationship with Gu Zhou in the past, but he had never understood Gu Zhou’s true thoughts.
