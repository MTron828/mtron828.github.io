948 Sleep!

Gu Zhou looked down at Qiao Nian. Her face was reflected in his pupils, and gentleness gradually appeared in his eyes.

His throat moved uncontrollably. He looked down at Qiao Nian and couldn’t help but kiss her forehead.

Qiao Nian’s pupils dilated, and her body froze.

His kiss was very gentle, but it instantly brought Qiao Nian back to that night six years ago, which had made her terrified and uneasy.

!!

At that time, she was held tightly in that person’s arms. She wanted to struggle and escape, but she couldn’t.

Later on, he planted a gentle and light kiss on her forehead. Later on, more and more kisses landed on her eyebrows, eyes, and cheeks…

Qiao Nian’s eyes were red. Actually, he probably didn’t want to hurt her that night either…

However, he was drugged and couldn’t control himself at all.

“Nian’er!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s voice, she came back to her senses and saw him looking at her intently.

“You need to rest. If there’s anything, we’ll talk after you wake up.” Gu Zhou tucked Qiao Nian’s hair behind her ear, his eyes a bottomless sea.

Qiao Nian felt that she should be angry when she saw Gu Zhou.

However, Gu Zhou’s gentleness made her feel as if she was being doted on. She thought of how Gu Zhou had stood on the tank, waiting for her to come out of Jiang Chi’s house.

At that time, she had a feeling that she was not fighting alone. Gu Zhou would always stand behind her and be her strong support.

She watched as Gu Zhou left. When the door closed completely, she closed her eyes.

She was the eldest daughter of the Lu family, and she was also engaged to Gu Zhou. If nothing had happened back then, she and Gu Zhou would have lived happily together long ago.

In a daze, Qiao Nian fell asleep.

After Gu Zhou walked out of the room, he stood outside the door.

The gentleness in his eyes gradually disappeared, replaced by coldness.

His body emitted a cold aura as he walked out coldly. When the servants in the corridor saw Gu Zhou, they were so frightened that they did not dare to breathe. They lowered their heads and stood aside to make way.

Gu Zhou placed his right hand in his pocket and walked down the stairs. When he reached the first floor, he saw Chen Qing standing there.

When Chen Qing saw Gu Zhou come down, he shrank back in fear.

“Have you caught him?” Gu Zhou asked coldly.

When Chen Qing heard Gu Zhou’s voice, he felt an ice blade hanging over his head. His life was in danger.

Chen Qing lowered his head even more and said, “I was a step too late when I arrived. He had already escaped, but I’ve already gotten someone to continue investigating his whereabouts. There’ll probably be news soon!”

Gu Zhou narrowed his phoenix-like eyes, a cold glint flashing in them. He said calmly, “We’ll settle this score with Qiao Xin first.”

Gu Zhou’s voice was very calm, but the meaning behind his words was very ferocious.

Chen Qing had been by Gu Zhou’s side for a long time. He said fawningly, “Yes!”

Qiao Xin was simply brainless. How dare she provoke Second Young Madam? She must have had nothing better to do!

She deserved it!

Someone as vicious as Qiao Xin should have been dealt with long ago. They shouldn’t have let her be smug for so long!

This time, Second Young Master was really planning to deal with Qiao Xin. Qiao Xin would probably never make a comeback for the rest of her life!

Chen Qing had already sent someone to keep an eye on Qiao Xin, so he said, “Qiao Xin is in the hospital. We…”

Gu Zhou’s eyes turned cold. His thin lips parted slightly. “To the hospital.”

“Yes!”

With that, Chen Qing turned around and walked out. When he walked into the courtyard and felt the sunlight, he heaved a sigh of relief.

The pressure had finally lessened!

… .

At the hospital.

Qiao Xin took the medicine absent-mindedly, then took a sip of water. After swallowing all the pills, she looked at Qiao Shan uneasily and asked carefully, “Dad, do you think Qiao Nian will visit Grandma’s grave?”

Qiao Shan frowned and said nothing.

Qiao Xin continued, “For Grandma’s sake, Qiao Nian will probably forgive me!”

However, before Qiao Shan could speak, the door of the ward was kicked open.

Bang!

There were still many people in the corridor of the ward. When everyone saw that someone had kicked the ward door open, their expressions changed.

Six people in black suits chased everyone else away from the corridor.

Qiao Shan and Qiao Yu looked at the two people at the door and were both stunned.
