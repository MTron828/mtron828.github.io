Chapter 221: Delicious

It was her birthday. Yet, she was delighted just because of these instant noodles. Instant noodles that she had cooked herself, no less.

Gu Zhou looked at the bowl of instant noodles. He had initially been unwilling to eat it, but he suddenly found that he had an appetite.

He picked up his chopsticks, picked up some instant noodles, and took a bite.

Seeing that Gu Zhou was eating the noodles, Qiao Nian looked at him expectantly and asked, “How is it? Does it taste good?”

Chen Qing was also looking at Gu Zhou curiously. He had always thought that Master Gu would never eat instant noodles in his life.

Gu Zhou swallowed the bite without changing his expression. Only then did he say, “It’s not bad.”

When Qiao Nian heard this, a bright smile appeared on her face. She said proudly, “I told you. Instant noodles are especially delicious.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Gu Zhou was dazzled by Qiao Nian’s bright smile. The corner of his lips quirked up imperceptibly. He couldn’t help but nod.

After the meal, Chen Qing was in charge of clearing the table. He washed the dishes and cleaned the yard as well before the three of them left the place.

When everyone returned to the villa, they saw Jiang Yue watering the plants in the garden from afar.

When Jiang Yue saw Qiao Nian, she immediately put down the watering can in her hand and walked up to them happily. Smiling, she greeted, “Brother Ah Zhou, Second Sister-in-law!”

Qiao Nian gave a perfunctory murmur of acknowledgement.

Gu Zhou couldn’t even be bothered to glance at Jiang Yue. He ignored her completely.

Ever since Jiang Yue had stolen Qiao Nian’s gown, she rarely appeared in front of Qiao Nian. During this period of time, she seemed to have lost a lot of weight.

Jiang Yue didn’t seem to notice Gu Zhou’s disdainful expression. She smiled at Qiao Nian and said earnestly, “Second Sister-in-law, I’m sorry. I just found out that today is your birthday. Happy birthday!”

With that, Jiang Yue took out an exquisite-looking box from behind her back and handed it to Qiao Nian. “Happy birthday. I hope you’ll like my gift!”

Qiao Nian smiled faintly. If someone was giving her a gift, she would naturally accept it without hesitation. Smiling, she said, “I’m sure I will. Thank you.”

Seeing that Qiao Nian had accepted the gift, Jiang Yue heaved a sigh of relief. She had been worried that Qiao Nian wouldn’t accept her gift because of what had happened at the speech ceremony.

Gu Zhou walked into the house.

Qiao Nian opened the box. Inside was a very beautiful bracelet made with diamonds. From the brightness of the diamonds, she could tell that they were expensive.

“Second Sister-in-law, this bracelet is named Smooth Sailing.” Jiang Yue smiled at Qiao Nian and explained gently, “I heard from Grandma that you’ll be going to the music academy tomorrow. I hope the bracelet can bring you good luck!”

Smiling, Qiao Nian thanked her and moved to follow Gu Zhou into the house.

Looking at Qiao Nian’s retreating back, Jiang Yue frowned. She couldn’t help but call out to Qiao Nian, “Second Sister-in-law, please wait a moment.”

Qiao Nian turned to look at Jiang Yue in confusion. “What is it?”

“Second Sister-in-law, I was wrong about the gown. I know my mistake now.” Jiang Yue bit her lip and said pitifully, “Grandma has been ignoring me recently. I’m very upset about it. Second Sister-in-law, can you help me put in a good word for her?”

“If you really know that you’re in the wrong, Grandma will definitely forgive you. She doesn’t need anyone to tell her what to think.”

Jiang Yue’s face instantly turned pale. She had thought that Qiao Nian would let bygones be bygones after accepting the gift, but she had never expected Qiao Nian to refuse to help.

Qiao Nian turned around and walked towards the second floor. Just as she reached the second floor, she saw the butler coming out of Matriarch Gu’s room.

“Butler.”

Seeing that Qiao Nian was calling him, the butler walked over and greeted politely, “Second Young Madam.”

“Where’s the female housekeeper? I haven’t seen her since yesterday.”

The butler lowered his head. He knew that Qiao Nian was referring to Wang Miao. He said respectfully, “She has already left. She was chased out by Second Young Master.”

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. Wang Miao had looked especially arrogant. Hence, she had thought that Wang Miao had gotten her position by pulling some strings.
