Chapter 205: The Lu Family

Just as Chen Qing was feeling puzzled, his phone rang again. The caller ID showed “Gu Zhou”. He hurriedly picked up the phone and greeted respectfully, “Master?”

“Have you made a reservation at the restaurant, and prepared the cake?” Gu Zhou asked coldly.

Hearing Gu Zhou’s words, Chen Qing heaved a sigh of relief and hurriedly replied, “I’ve already done so.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the dial tone began playing again.

Only then did Chen Qing place his phone back on the table and heave a sigh of relief.

He found Second Young Master a little strange today. He actually wanted to celebrate Second Young Madam’s birthday.

Tsk, tsk.

Second Young Master definitely had Second Young Madam in his heart!

…

At the Lu family villa.

Matriarch Gu led Qiao Nian into the Lu residence.

Matriarch Lu was already standing in the courtyard to welcome them. When she saw Matriarch Gu and Qiao Nian, the coldness and sternness in her expression dissipated significantly, and she looked much gentler.

Lu Qi had been accompanying Matriarch Lu the entire time. When she saw Qiao Nian, a polite smile appeared on her face.

The two elders met and greeted each other, then walked into the house, supporting each other. Both of them were in low spirits.

Qiao Nian and Lu Qi walked behind.

“Nian Nian, I didn’t expect you to be Brother Ah Zhou’s wife.” Lu Qi turned to look at Qiao Nian, surprise written all over her face.

“Yup.” Qiao Nian nodded. Grandma had brought her here this time for her to get to know more people in this circle.

Lu Qi was still very surprised. In a daze, she said, “The two of you didn’t even speak to each other during the speech ceremony. If Brother hadn’t told me after…”

“Qi Qi!”

A cold voice interrupted Lu Qi sternly.

Qiao Nian looked over and saw Lu Zhu standing not far away in a black suit. Even though he was wearing spectacles, they couldn’t hide the dark circles under his eyes. It was obvious that he hadn’t had a good night’s sleep for the past few days.

“Madam Gu.” Lu Zhu walked up to Matriarch Gu politely.

Matriarch Gu smiled and said, “Where are your parents?”

“They’ve already gone overseas,” Lu Zhu said in a low voice.

He knew in his heart that his parents could not face his sister’s death, so every time his sister’s death anniversary approached, they would leave An City. It was as though they could keep his sister alive in their hearts by doing this.

“Let’s go in!” Matriarch Lu said.

The Lu family’s villa was completely different from the Gu family’s villa. The antique-looking furniture made one feel as if they had time-traveled to ancient times.

The fragrance of Longjing tea filled the entire room. Matriarch Lu invited everyone to sit down, then got the servants to bring over some fruits and snacks.

Smiling, Matriarch Gu glanced at Qiao Nian. Qiao Nian then handed the wooden box to Matriarch Gu. Taking out the blessing bag from the box, Matriarch Gu handed it to Matriarch Lu. She said gently, “This is the blessing bag my granddaughter-in-law made for your precious granddaughter. It has been prayed over in front of the Buddha for a long time. Every day, she only works on it after taking a bath. I hope your granddaughter won’t mind that Qiao Nian’s hands are clumsy.”

Matriarch Lu had already been very grateful to Qiao Nian. Glancing at the blessing bag, she forced a smile and praised, “You’re truly skilled!”

As she spoke, Matriarch Lu couldn’t help but look at Qiao Nian again. She continued, “Very few people know how to embroider well these days.”

Lu Qi moved closer to Matriarch Lu, taking a careful look at the blessing bag. She sighed. “This blessing bag is so beautiful. I think Sister will definitely like it very much!”

Lu Qi spoke with a sincere expression. She had no intention of flattering her at all!

When Qiao Nian heard Lu Qi’s words, she couldn’t help but smile. Every time she looked at Lu Qi, she felt a great sense of comfort. “In that case, I’ll make a calming pouch for you in the future. You can put it by your bed. It’ll be good for your sleep!”

Without bothering with the conventional pleasantries, Lu Qi said happily, “Okay!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

When Matriarch Lu heard Lu Qi’s reply, she was slightly stunned. One had to know that Lu Qi would only do away with pleasantries when she was speaking to those close to her. It seemed that Lu Qi and Qiao Nian were really close.
