840 Worried

Qiao Nian inadvertently met Gu Zhou’s sparkling eyes. She felt a little uncomfortable under his gaze. Thinking that she had said something wrong, she asked, “Have I overstepped my boundary?”

After she asked, Gu Zhou remained silent.

Qiao Nian’s eyes were filled with confusion. What kind of gaze was this? Why was he staring at her?

“I think you’ve thought it through very well.” Gu Zhou pursed his lips and looked at Qiao Nian gently. “I’ll do as you say.”

Hearing Gu Zhou’s words, Qiao Nian had a strange feeling. She asked curiously, “Aren’t you suspecting that I have selfish motives?”

“Thank you!”

Qiao Nian was stunned. She didn’t know why Gu Zhou would thank her directly.

“You’re also concerned about the children.” What made Gu Zhou the happiest was that Qiao Nian had never thought of leaving.

Qiao Nian said, “Then are you still angry?”

She looked at Gu Zhou. He didn’t look angry at all.

Sunlight filtered through the car window and fell on Gu Zhou’s face. Gu Zhou looked much gentler. He shook his head and said, “I’m not angry anymore!”

He was no longer angry.

After all, Qiao Nian had never thought of leaving. He had just misunderstood.

Moreover, Qiao Nian had arranged it very well. If he were asked to do this, he would probably do the same.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou in confusion. In the end, she asked, “Then why were you angry just now?”

Just now, Gu Zhou looked very angry, as if he wanted to eat her up. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The tips of Gu Zhou’s ears turned slightly red. He said honestly, “I thought you were going to settle everything. You were going to help Song Man enter the Gu family. When the time comes, you’ll divorce me and leave the Gu family!”

Leave the Gu family? Qiao Nian blinked in confusion.

To be honest, she had really never thought of it that way.

From the beginning, she had felt that Xiao Shi’s mother was a strange person. Later on, after seeing Song Man, she confirmed her guess. Her mother was really a strange person!

Her mind was filled with thoughts of how to protect Gu Qi and Xiao Shi. She had no time to care about herself.

After hearing Gu Zhou’s words, she recalled that she had taken the initiative. Hence, she asked tentatively, “Don’t you want to start a family with Song Man? That way, your family of four can be together forever in harmony. To children, being with their biological parents can give them enough security!”

“You want me to be with Song Man?” Gu Zhou’s voice sounded a little low. He looked at Qiao Nian sharply.

“I’m just saying that according to blood ties, it’s a better choice for you to be with Song Man.”

“Blood ties?” Gu Zhou repeated, a trace of coldness flashing across his face.

“Yes.” Qiao Nian nodded. Although she felt that Song Man treated Xiao Shi badly, they were still biological mother and daughter.

Gu Zhou’s eyes turned cold. He recalled what he had experienced when he was young.

The last thing he believed in was blood ties. He didn’t think blood ties were good things.

Blood ties were a burden to him.

If possible, he would never want to be related to anyone from the Gu family other than Matriarch Gu.

Gu Zhou’s lips curved up in a mocking smile. He said coldly, “Family ties are just a burden. They make you restrained to your family and lead to unconditional demands from them! Therefore, sometimes, blood ties are the most disgusting kind of relationship!”

Qiao Nian hadn’t expected Gu Zhou to say such a thing.

Qiao Nian suddenly recalled that Matriarch Gu had told her about Gu Zhou’s childhood.

Gu Zhou had not been happy at all in his childhood.

Gu Zhou seemed to exist for his brother.

His value was completely ignored by the Gu family.

Worried that Gu Zhou would get carried away again, Qiao Nian hurriedly comforted him. “Although she didn’t grow up by your side, I can tell that she likes you very much! She was especially happy to see you!”
