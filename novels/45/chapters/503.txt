Chapter 504: Crying

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Lu Zhu noticed that Qiao Nian’s body was trembling slightly. He also realized that Qiao Nian was suppressing her tears. It was as if a huge rock was pressing down on her chest, making it difficult for her to breathe.

This pain didn’t feel like the physical pain of falling and getting hurt.

Instead, her heart hurt like hell. She couldn’t say it, but it throbbed. All she could do was try to regulate her breathing and reduce the pain in her heart.

After a long time, Lu Zhu comforted her, “Sugar, I’m here as your family member. You don’t have to be a strong person or control yourself. I’m also your safe haven.”

Hearing Lu Zhu’s words, Qiao Nian lost control and burst into tears, wetting Lu Zhu’s clothes. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

If she had found her brother earlier and reunited with him, perhaps they would not have to suffer so much.

She really hadn’t cried in a long time.

She couldn’t remember the last time she cried.

She had never been one to cry, but the warmth of her brother’s arms was overwhelming. The sound of his voice made her want to weep.

She could not help but hug Lu Zhu tightly, as if she wanted to cry out all the grievances she had suffered over the years.

It was really fortunate that she had a brother and family who truly loved her.

She was not a wretch abandoned by her family.

Her family really just hadn’t found her.

Lu Zhu patted Qiao Nian’s back gently, comforting her.

After an unknown period of time, Qiao Nian finally managed to stabilize her emotions. She silently withdrew from Lu Zhu’s embrace and wiped her tears with the back of her hand, feeling much better.

She suddenly felt a little embarrassed. She bit her lower lip and looked up at Lu Zhu shyly. “Brother, don’t tell my family about me crying.”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Lu Zhu’s lips curled up. He reached out and stroked Qiao Nian’s head dotingly.

Qiao Nian very naturally moved closer to Lu Zhu and gently rubbed against his hand. The corners of her mouth couldn’t help but curl up as she muttered, “I’m already so old. I shouldn’t be crying, so you’re not allowed to tell them.”

Qiao Nian made up her mind that when she returned to An City and acknowledged her other brothers and family, she wouldn’t cry again just because they would spoil her. After all, she had already grown up.

Lu Zhu’s gaze landed on Qiao Nian’s face. Seeing how obedient she was, he was extremely moved.

Such a delicate and cute appearance should be the real her.

He was so lucky to have his sister’s trust again, and to have her show him her truest side without reservation.

When Lu Zhu thought about how his brothers did not know that he had found his sister, he was instantly in a good mood and felt inexplicably proud.

He was the first person to acknowledge his sister.

Lu Zhu smiled at Qiao Nian and nodded. “Alright, I won’t tell them about your crying today.”

He recognized his sister now. It was just as well he could spend more time with her. This was their chance to be alone. He wasn’t going to let his brothers come over and cause trouble.

Hearing this, Qiao Nian’s lips curled up slightly. Her smile was bright and beautiful, instantly dispelling all the gloom in Lu Zhu’s heart.

Sugar was back. He would never have a nightmare again.

After more than twenty years, he could sleep peacefully.

Qiao Nian’s gaze landed on Lu Zhu’s injury. She frowned slightly and said in a low voice, “Brother, it’s very windy outside now. Let’s go back early. I’ll help you!”

“Yes.”

Qiao Nian held Lu Zhu’s arm affectionately as they walked back. The lights from the street lamps cast a long shadow on the two of them. The fireflies in the night sky were still shining brightly. Suddenly, it felt like time had passed peacefully.

Doctor Sha looked at Qiao Nian and Lu Zhu and couldn’t help but tear up. The siblings’ relationship was too touching.

After Qiao Nian and Lu Zhu left, Song Yue, who had been hiding behind the fake hill, pushed her wheelchair out.

Song Yue stared at Qiao Nian’s back in disbelief. She had never expected Qiao Nian to be Lu Zhu’s sister.
