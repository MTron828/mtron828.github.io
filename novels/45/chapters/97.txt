Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

Qiao Nian chose to no longer dwell on this matter. Instead, she said softly, “Grandma, you’ve just woken up and you’re still very weak. You need to recuperate in a quiet environment. Don’t worry, Second Young Master will definitely investigate what happened today.”

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Matriarch Gu nodded in agreement. “Alright, I’l sleep for a while. You should go back and rest too!”

Jiang Yue, who had been standing at the side, had tears running down her face.

Grandma had called for Second Brother and Qiao Nian, but not her.

It was as if she wasn’t even a member of the Gu family.

So Grandma didn’t care about her at all.

While Jiang Yue was thinking this, the butler was still untying the knots around her wrists!

Jiang Yue now understood that the only person she could count on in the Gu family was Grandma. Hence, she stepped forward and said, “Second Brother, I want to stay here and take care of Grandma.”

Qiao Nian wanted to object, but she didn’t want to quarrel with Jiang Yue in front of Grandma. She could only hope that Gu Zhou wouldn’t let Jiang Yue stay.

Gu Zhou gave Jiang Yue an indifferent glance. Showing no mercy, he refused her request. “Grandma needs to rest quietly. She won’t need company.”

The last bit of blood drained from Jiang Yue’s face. Biting her lip, she walked out with everyone else.

The butler was the last to leave Matriarch Gu’s room. He closed the door and instructed two servants to guard Matriarch Gu’s door.

The butler brought Doctor Su to the medicinal room. They still had to investigate what had happened there. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

As the group gradually dispersed, Gu Zhou stood at the entrance of Matriarch Gu’s room. He did not leave immediately. Instead, he looked worriedly at Matriarch Gu’s door.

Qiao Nian didn’t leave either. She believed that the truth about what had happened in the medicinal room would come to light very soon.

Hence, she chose to stand guard at Matriarch Gu’s door, thinking that if Matriarch Gu needed anything, she could provide assistance as soon as possible.

Jiang Yue had initially wanted to return to her room, but seeing that Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian had both stayed behind, she decided to stay as well.

With her head slightly lowered, Jiang Yue glanced at Gu Zhou out of the corner of her eye, then at Qiao Nian. Her mind was racing.

“Second Sister-in-law.” Jiang Yue walked up to Qiao Nian, breaking the silence in the corridor. Her voice was as gentle as ever, and tinged with a shade of apology.

Qiao Nian leaned on the wall with her arms crossed. Standing at half a head taller than Jiang Yue, she looked down at Jiang Yue impassively. The displeasure in her eyes was obvious.

Jiang Yue seemed to be frightened by Qiao Nian’s gaze. Her eyes grew red-rimmed in an instant, brimming with tears.

suppressing her tears, Jiang Yue spoke, her voice choked-up. “Second Sister-in-law, I was in the wrong just now. I’m really sorry.”

Qiao Nian didn’t say anything, She just looked at Jiang Yue calmly.

Jiang Yue felt a little uncomfortable under Qiao Nian’s gaze. She lowered her head, tears flowing down her cheeks in silence. “If anything happens to Grandma, I won’t want to live anymore.”

Qiao Nian didn’t speak for a long time. She just stared at Jiang Yue. When she saw Jiang Yue sneaking a glance at her, she spoke. “Jiang Yue.”

Qiao Nian’s voice was cold, like ice in the dead of winter. It chilled one to the bone.

Jiang Yue looked up at Qiao Nian with teary eyes. She felt a chill run down her spine.

Qiao Nian continued looking at Jiang Yue calmly, her brow raised. She enunciated each word clearly as she spoke. “Can you swear on the souls of your deceased parents that you didn’t tamper with any of the herbs in the medicine cabinet?”

Qiao Nian’s words attracted the attention of the servants. One by one, they looked toward Jiang Yue, waiting to watch a good show.

Jiang Yue tended to act high and mighty in the Gu residence, and often bullied the servants. They had long found Jiang Yue an eyesore.

Jiang Yue’s face was now as pale as a sheet of paper. Her teeth were chattering, and her hands were clenched tightly.

“If you’re the one who harmed Grandma, your parents’ souls will never be reincarnated. You’ll never be able to be with the person you love for the rest of your life!” Qiao Nian narrowed her eyes at Jiang Yue. “Do you dare to take this oath?”

Jiang Yue’s breathing grew more and more rapid, and her heart gradually rose to her throat. Her forehead was covered in sweat, and she swayed on the spot, as if she would faint at any moment..
