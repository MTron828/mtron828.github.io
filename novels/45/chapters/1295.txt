1296 Things Are Not Good

Wherever the ambulance went, all the cars gave way.

In less than ten minutes, the ambulance arrived at the hospital entrance. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Chen Qing had already greeted the hospital staff. The surgeon was already waiting outside.

Gu Zhou’s bed was pushed out of the ambulance. Then, the doctors surrounded him and followed the bed into the hospital.

Gu Zhou’s injuries were serious. The X-rays of the other patients in the hospital were pushed to the back. He entered the X-ray room directly.

Qiao Nian stood outside and waited anxiously. About ten minutes later, the radiographic films were out. The attending doctor took a look and said solemnly, “Looks like the situation isn’t good.”

Qiao Nian frowned and walked over to the attending doctor. Her gaze fell on the X-ray in the attending doctor’s hand, and her face turned pale.

“This bullet is just short of penetrating the kidney. We have to remove the bullet now.” The doctor looked at the scan and frowned. “The bullet is really too close to the kidney. If we’re not careful, we might damage the kidney. When that happens, there will be a problem with the kidney and the patient won’t be able to stop the bleeding in his body. This situation is very dangerous. The only solution now is to remove the kidney. When the time comes, we can remove the bullet together. Otherwise…”

“There’s no need to remove the kidney!” Qiao Nian interrupted the doctor and said appraisingly, “Just remove the bullet!”

When the nurses at the side heard Qiao Nian’s words, they all rolled their eyes. In their opinion, an outsider was boasting shamelessly that she wanted the doctor to remove the bullet.

The family members of patients nowadays were really getting more and more demanding. They did not listen to the doctor at all.

How the surgery was done was up to the doctor. The doctor’s decision was for the patient’s own good. If he bled profusely, he would be dead!

The doctor was about to curse, but looking at Qiao Nian’s beautiful face, he swallowed his words and said gently, “Miss, I know you’re very worried about the patient, but in the current situation, I need to…”

“There’s no need. Prepare the operating theater now. I’ll be the chief surgeon, and I’ll sign it!” Qiao Nian said expressionlessly. She looked at the nurses around her. “Just prepare what you need for the surgery now!”

When the doctor heard this, he was furious. If it weren’t for the fact that this patient’s family member was quite good-looking, he would have ignored her long ago.

The family members of patients nowadays really did not know their limits. They even dared to mention surgery for their family members!

“No,” the doctor said without hesitation. “You can’t do that. An outsider like you can’t enter the operating theater. Moreover, his condition needs to be judged by three surgeons at the same time. If someone dies, it will cause damage to our hospital’s reputation!”

The nurses at the side covered their mouths and sniggered. They felt that this beautiful young woman was crazy.

As the doctor spoke, he saw that she was still scrolling through her phone. He frowned and said seriously again, “Do you understand what I’m saying? Don’t…”

As soon as the doctor finished speaking, he saw Qiao Nian place the phone screen in front of him. When he saw the photo on the phone, he gasped and looked at Qiao Nian in disbelief.

He was in his forties and was also an ordinary surgeon, but this young lady was actually a specialist doctor.

The so-called specialist doctors were the most advanced doctors. Those doctors were basically proficient in several subjects.

Qiao Nian put away the photo of her medical certificate and said calmly, “We’re preparing for the surgery to remove the bullet. I hope you can cooperate with me and ensure that there won’t be any mistakes in the process of me being the chief surgeon!”

The doctor hurriedly nodded and said, “Alright, I’ll instruct them now!”

After the doctor agreed, he said to the nurses beside him, “She’s a doctor. She’ll be the chief surgeon for this surgery. Hurry up and prepare to start.”

The nurses who had been secretly mocking Qiao Nian were all so shocked that their mouths were wide open.

The emergency room was already prepared for the surgery.

Qiao Nian led the doctor and a few nurses into the emergency room after they disinfected themselves and put on professional surgical gowns.

“Anesthesiologist, prepare anesthesia.” After instructing the anesthesiologist, Qiao Nian walked up to Gu Zhou and said softly, “Hubby.”
