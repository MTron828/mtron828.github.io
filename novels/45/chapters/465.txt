Chapter 466: An Early Death

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

A gentle smile appeared on Jiang Chi’s face as he said, “I’m afraid I’ll have to disappoint Second Young Master Gu. The two of them said that they’ll be staying in the Ghost City for a while.”

Jiang Chi’s attitude was gentle, and no one could find any fault with him.

At this moment, Gu Zhou raised his hand slightly. Suddenly, a cold dagger appeared in his hand. He raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at Jiang Chi’s face. “I like to be polite before resorting to force. Mr. Jiang, on account of your relationship with my brother, I hope you can hand them over. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being rude!”

Jiang Chi chuckled softly, his blue eyes shining brightly. He asked, “What if I’m unwilling?”

“It’s not New Year’s yet, but I wouldn’t mind having some fireworks in your ghost town to celebrate in advance. What do you think?”

The smile on Jiang Chi’s face gradually disappeared. His phoenix eyes narrowed slightly, and the smell of gunpowder on his body became stronger and stronger, as if he was about to destroy the world!

Jiang Wen was shocked by Gu Zhou’s murderous aura. He was really worried that Gu Zhou would raze Ghost City to the ground. He tried to smooth things over. “Young Master Gu, our master and your brother are good brothers. Speaking of which, we’re still family. Let’s talk slowly. It’s not appropriate to set off fireworks now. I think your big brother will be unhappy if he finds out!”

When Gu Zhou heard Jiang Wen mention his eldest brother, his hand that was playing with the dagger paused. All his patience was almost exhausted.

Gu Zhou tugged at the tie around his neck impatiently. He placed his hand in his pocket and took out his walkie-talkie. He looked into Jiang Chi’s eyes and ordered without hesitation, “Everyone, come up!”

As soon as Gu Zhou finished speaking, the small stones on the ground trembled non-stop.

Jiang Chi looked down at the trembling ground and frowned. He looked up and saw dense tanks driving over from afar.

Now Jiang Wen’s face was pale with fear.

Jiang Chi frowned slightly, a strange look flashing across his eyes.

More than twenty tanks had arrived.

These tanks could easily raze his place to the ground.

Gu Zhou’s gaze landed on Jiang Chi’s face. He raised his hand and pinched the bridge of his nose. He said impatiently, “Mr. Jiang, it’s getting late. It’s already been five minutes. There’s still five minutes left. My patience is limited!”

Everyone from Qin Chuan was stunned.

Who exactly was their Boss Qiao?

Even Young Master Gu was alarmed!

In order to save Qiao Nian, the Second Young Master of the Gu family had even fought with his elder brother’s sworn brother.

Moreover, the determination in Gu Zhou’s eyes was not fake at all.

It seemed that as long as Jiang Chi did not hand over Qiao Nian and Lu Zhu, Gu Zhou would really raze Ghost City to the ground.

Chen Shi was in a mess.

Seeing this, Chen Qing walked up to Gu Zhou and reminded him in a low voice, “Second Young Master, the two of them are still inside. You can’t fire at will!”

Gu Zhou’s expression was calm as he said casually, “If Mr. Jiang isn’t willing to let them go, I think they might be imprisoned for the rest of their lives. Instead of that, why don’t we give them a quick death and let them reincarnate early?”

Chen Qing was speechless.

Second Master, you’re ruthless!

After saying that, Gu Zhou exuded a cold aura. He turned around and got into the tank. He looked down at Jiang Chi and couldn’t help but remind him, “Mr. Jiang, there are still three minutes. Have you thought it through?”

Jiang Wen had been standing at the back and did not want to say anything. At this moment, when he saw Gu Zhou’s arrogant expression, he could not help but say angrily, “Don’t go overboard. Your big brother has never been so arrogant and conceited towards our master. Let me tell you, Mr. Lu has killed one of our people, so it’s only right for us to detain him! Why should we listen to you and let him go? We have to avenge our Jiang family!”

Suddenly, there was a flash of cold light.

The dagger in Gu Zhou’s hand hit Jiang Wen’s knee without hesitation. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Jiang Wen instantly knelt on the ground in pain. His brows were tightly furrowed, but he did not fall.

Jiang Chi’s expression instantly darkened. “Gu Zhou!”
