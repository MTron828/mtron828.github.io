Chapter 188: The Truth?

Su Xue’s face alternated between shades of green and white. She could hardly stand the humiliation.

Qiao Nian had plenty of time today. She pulled over a chair and sat down elegantly in front of Su Xue. She raised her eyebrows slightly. “Now, can you tell me the truth? Who are my biological parents? Also, why did you bring me into the Qiao family? I advise you to tell me everything in detail.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Qiao Shan couldn’t help but frown. It was a long story, and he didn’t know where to begin.

Su Xue saw that Qiao Shan was deep in thought. Her eyes darted to the side, and she hurriedly spoke. “I remember this matter very clearly!”

When Qiao Shan heard Su Xue’s words, he remained expressionless. In reality, Su Xue was in charge of most of the matters in the Qiao family anyway.

Qiao Shan temporarily put aside the fact that Su Xue was having an affair and listened to her continue.

Su Xue heaved a small sigh of relief. She glared at Qiao Nian viciously, as if she was determined to fight to the death. “In the past, I was worried that you would be upset, so I kept it from you. I didn’t tell you the truth. Now that you’ve found out, there’s no need for me to hide it from you anymore. You’re a bastard child I picked up from the hospital! A wild child abandoned by your parents!”

Qiao Nian sat there in silence, looking at Su Xue expressionlessly.

A smug smile appeared on Su Xue’s face. She asked, “Did you think that you were the precious daughter of some rich family?”

“Qiao Nian, stop dreaming.” Su Xue stood up, wiping her tears and the blood from her nose. She said coldly, “Your mother was just some woman from the countryside. She fell in love with a rich man, but that rich man already had a wife. Your mother was looked down upon by her family because she had gotten pregnant before marriage. She wanted to abort you, but if she did, she might never be able to get pregnant again for the rest of her life. That’s why she secretly gave birth in the hospital without telling her family. She was hoping to give birth to a son. ()Since a son would be treasured more than a daughter, she was planning to take the chance to marry the rich man, because his wife had only given birth to one daughter.

“Yet when she gave birth to a daughter, that rich man gave her two thousand dollars and left. Your mother had never expected that to happen. The rich man told her that he had only wanted to use your mother’s womb to have a son.” Su Xue looked at Qiao Nian with a challenge in her eyes.

“I was your mother’s doctor back then. After she gave birth to you, she threw you into the trash. I took pity on you and brought you home.” At this point, Su Xue snorted. “In that case, I’m the one who saved your life!”

Qiao Nian frowned a little, staring unblinkingly at Su Xue. The coldness in her eyes grew more obvious. “Is that so?”

Su Xue laughed and retorted, “What do you think the truth is? Back then, sons were so valuable. Who would break up their family just for a daughter?”

Qiao Nian’s eyes narrowed.

That wasn’t untrue. More than twenty years ago, every family valued boys over girls. In order to have a son to inherit the business, many rich people would spend a lot of money to find someone who could give birth to a son for them.

If the child was a son, the rich man would take the child home. If it was a daughter, she would be left on the streets.

Seeing that Qiao Nian was seriously considering the credibility of her words, Su Xue continued, “If it weren’t for me, you would have died long ago. I saved you. I’m your life savior, your lifelong benefactor. Now, you’re actually helping outsiders plot against me. You’re really an ingrate!”

“Heh.” Qiao Nian gave a cold laugh.

Su Xue felt a chill run down her spine from Qiao Nian’s gaze. Frowning, she questioned, “What are you laughing at?”

Qiao Nian narrowed her eyes and looked at Su Xue coldly. “In that case, should I thank you?”

Su Xue couldn’t tell if Qiao Nian believed her. She said coldly, “You’re the one who owes me a debt. It’s common knowledge that raising a child is a far more arduous task than giving birth, and far more deserving of gratitude. For so many years, I’ve tirelessly raised you. If it weren’t for me, you would have died in the hospital long ago!”
