Chapter 239: White Lotus

The other two people who had fallen to the ground also stood up and pounced on Qiao Nian. They were both precious daughters of their families. How could they take this lying down after being bullied today?

Qiao Nian wanted to attack, but when her gaze fell on the classroom door, she saw that someone had entered. Her clenched fists had already loosened, and she didn’t dodge. She stood rooted to the ground in shock.

Seeing that Qiao Nian didn’t move, Chen Xue thought that Qiao Nian was frightened by her aura. She raised her hand, preparing to slap Qiao Nian.

“Stop!”

Suddenly, a stern voice came from the door, stopping Chen Xue!

When Chen Xue heard that voice, her body trembled involuntarily. She turned her head inch by inch towards the classroom door and saw Professor Zhang with a furious expression. Her face instantly turned pale.

“Professor… Professor Zhang,” Chen Xue stammered.

When Ye Ran saw that Professor Zhang had arrived, she immediately burst into tears. She got up from the ground and walked towards Professor Zhang, holding her stomach. “Professor Zhang, Qiao Nian stole my things. I didn’t want to argue with her, but she even hit me. You have to stand up for me!”

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze.

Pretending to be pitiful. Who didn’t know this trick?

Qiao Nian looked up. Her beautiful fox-like eyes were instantly red-rimmed. There was a layer of moisture in her eyes, as if tears would fall at any moment.

Qiao Nian sniffled and said in a low voice, sounding as if she was about to cry, “Professor Zhang, the moment I arrived at the classroom today, they searched through Wang Xuan’s and my desks without hesitation. Now, they’ve thrown our things into a mess. She even accused me of stealing her tickets!”

Qiao Nian choked for a moment and continued, “They even said that they would compensate her with my violin and tickets. Professor, I really didn’t steal her tickets, but they insisted that I did. They refused to listen to my explanation and even wanted to hit me. I could only protect myself. Fortunately, you came. I hope you can catch the thief who stole the tickets yourself and clear my name!”

Qiao Nian spoke weakly. Every word she said made sense.

Wang Xuan was stunned. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Oh my god, she was truly a white lotus!

Holding her stomach, Ye Ran, who was standing at the side, looked at Qiao Nian in shock. If she wasn’t the victim, she might have believed Qiao Nian’s words.

Qiao Nian was too good at putting on an act!

With that, Qiao Nian lowered her gaze, a trace of amusement flashing in her eyes.

Hehe.

Wasn’t she just pretending to be a white lotus? Who didn’t know how to do that?

Ye Ran was still too inexperienced. Seeing Qiao Nian pretending to be a white lotus, her anger instantly surged from her chest to the top of her head. She roared, “Qiao Nian, you liar! You clearly kicked me first. You b*tch! Professor Zhang, you can’t be fooled by her! You can’t believe her!”

Qiao Nian’s frown deepened. She said pitifully, “Ye Ran, I really don’t know how I’ve offended you. You bullied me like this, and now you’re lying in front of Professor Zhang. If you didn’t attack me, how could I have accidentally pushed you to the ground?”

Ye Ran was speechless.

Damn!

Ye Ran was about to explode with rage. “Qiao Nian, you b*tch! I’ll tear you apart!”

“Enough!” Professor Zhang shouted sternly.

Ye Ran was shocked by Professor Zhang’s voice. Her heart jumped to her throat. She turned back to look at Professor Zhang and realized that he was looking at her with a livid expression.

Tears welled up in Ye Ran’s eyes. Just as she was about to speak, she saw the disappointment in Professor Zhang’s eyes.

“Professor Zhang,” Ye Ran greeted carefully. Only then did she realize that she had been tricked by Qiao Nian.

The only thing she could do now was to please Professor Zhang and get him to stand up for her.
