Chapter 1741 - 1741 I Was Wrong!

It wasn’t easy for Wright to stop coughing. He questioned word by word, “Gu Zhou brought soldiers and used guns to rampage on our European soil. President, shouldn’t you lock them all up and investigate all of them!”

Wright was just short of describing Gu Zhou as an enemy attacking Europe.

The president was so angry that his temples were throbbing. Such a beast was still talking about other things.

Previously, when Lina wanted to marry Wright, he was very dissatisfied. However, he thought to himself that Wright still liked Lina a little. He only hoped that Lina wouldn’t suffer if she married Wright.

But now, he felt that he had been wrong. He had been too wrong.

Mark was a crazy and cold-blooded person, and so was Wright. However, Wright was really too stupid. After committing many crimes, he had a lot of evidence against him. People would feel dirty just by looking at him.

The President looked at Wright’s questioning gaze and questioned coldly, “How do you know that they’re not part of the regular army? These are all my personal guards. Do I need your permission to privately nurture my personal guards?”

What?

Personal guards?

The president’s personal guards?𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Wright’s pupils dilated uncontrollably. Was the president a lunatic? These people clearly worked for Gu Zhou.

The president did not have the ability to raise troops at all. The president only had so little money. Everything he did was under his and Mark’s noses.

Although the previous president was cold and indifferent, he disdained to lie.

The current president had learned bad things from Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian. He had already begun to lie through his teeth. Moreover, he didn’t even blink when he lied!

“Impossible!” Wright retorted loudly and said sternly, “We’ve read all the documents. We also know about the finance department. Where did you get the money to raise soldiers!”

With that, Wright was stunned.

He… he seemed to have said something wrong.

The president standing in front of Wright had a dark expression. His blue eyes seemed to contain turbulent waves. He took a deep breath and said, “Arrest Wright and investigate him. Investigate him carefully. We have to investigate all the spies!”

“Yes!”

The guards brought by the president hurriedly agreed loudly. Then, they walked up to Wright, grabbed him, and carried him out.

Wright struggled hard. He was covered in injuries and felt terrible. He couldn’t escape from two strong guards at all.

Wright turned to look at the President anxiously and said loudly, “Mr. President, you’ve misunderstood. I said the wrong thing just now. There’s really no spies around you. How would I dare to plant spies around you, right? I was just confused just now, so I said the wrong thing.”

The president stood there with a dark expression. Listening to Wright, he turned to look at him and said coldly, “That’s true. You really wouldn’t dare.”

When Wright heard the president’s words, he heaved a sigh of relief and hurriedly nodded. “Yes, yes, yes. President, you know very well that I really wouldn’t dare!”

“So, those spies were planted by your father, Mark?” The President stared unblinkingly into Wright’s eyes and enunciated each word clearly.

Wright was about to speak when he thought of what the president had just said. He quickly shook his head and said, “President, you’ve misunderstood. How could my father do such a thing? I really said something wrong just now.”

The president looked at Wright with a faint smile and said softly, “Do you think I’ll believe you?”

Wright felt a chill run down his spine and couldn’t help but shiver.

At the engagement banquet, he had failed to show his perfect side. Chen Qing had also already made his father unhappy by punching him in public.

That night, his father lost his gold rooms too. At that time, his father was already very disappointed in him. Moreover, his father did not say anything that night and left the manor.
