1325 The little girl

Chang Feng was sent to the ward. Old Master Qin inserted the instrument into Chang Feng’s body. He looked at the screen of the electronic instrument and frowned. He said worriedly, “He’s not out of danger yet. If he can survive tonight, he’ll be fine, but…”

When Gu Yue, who was standing at the side, heard Old Master Qin’s words, his expression suddenly changed. His eyes darkened as he said in a low voice, “He’ll definitely be fine.”

On the surface, he was reassuring Old Master Qin, but in reality, he was comforting himself.

Butler Zhao looked at Chang Feng, who was lying on the hospital bed, with red-rimmed eyes. Previously, he had been chased by his enemies. If it weren’t for Chang Feng, he might have died long ago. All these years, he had always treated Chang Feng as his family. He didn’t want Chang Feng to be hurt at all.

Butler Zhao pretended to be calm and said, “Sir and Old Master Qin, I’ll prepare breakfast for you.”

With that, Butler Zhao turned around and walked out.

Only Old Master Qin and Gu Yue were left in the room.

Gu Yue looked at Chang Feng in front of him. His gaze changed a few times. Without saying the last sentence, he turned to leave.

Old Master Qin looked at Gu Yue and subconsciously called out, “Xiao Yue.”

Gu Yue stopped in his tracks. He looked at Old Master Qin and could see the anticipation in his eyes. He lowered his gaze slightly and said in a low voice, “Don’t worry, she’s fine.”

After a pause, Gu Yue continued, “Xiao Bao has already returned to her side. They already know what they need to know. They’ll probably return to An City soon.”

When Old Master Qin heard Gu Yue’s words, there was a hint of a smile in his eyes. He said softly, “That’s good. They’ll be safe when they return to the country. Those people’s power in the country is limited. They won’t do anything to them.”

Old Master Qin’s lips curved up slightly. He still remembered the first time he had seen Qiao Nian.

It was a snowy night. When he returned from his house call, Qiao Nian was still washing clothes at the entrance of the courtyard.

Late at night, that family was unwilling to let Qiao Nian rest. They insisted that she wash the clothes and even asked her to wash them outside the courtyard. They were afraid that they would disturb their family’s rest.

Seeing that there was a lot of snow on him, Qiao Nian hurriedly ran to the kitchen at the door, took out an umbrella, and handed it to him.

At that time, Qiao Nian was only a little child. She opened the umbrella and handed it to him. “Grandpa, it’s snowing. You have to hold an umbrella.”

The child’s voice was soft and childish.

He looked at Qiao Nian under the moonlight. She was wearing a thick sweater and pants. It was a cold day, her ears were red from the cold, and there was frostbite on her face.

Her shoes were summer slippers, and there was frostbite on her toes. Her entire body was red from the cold.

“Girl, why are you washing clothes in the middle of the night?” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Oh, Uncle and Aunt asked me to do the laundry. They’re exhausted from working all day.”

Hearing her young voice, Old Master Qin knew that this child had been fooled. He reached out and patted Qiao Nian’s head, asking in a low voice, “What about your parents?”

“My parents asked me to stay at Uncle’s place for the next few days. They’ll only bring me back in a few days!”

Old Master Qin looked at this little girl’s innocent face and sighed slightly. He didn’t take her umbrella and said in a low voice, “You can’t see clearly in the middle of the night. Don’t wash the clothes. Hurry up and go home. You can wash them tomorrow.”

The little girl shook her head. “I have to finish my chores today. I have to wash my clothes before I can sleep.”

“Thank you for your kindness. I don’t need an umbrella. I’m staying next door to you.” Old Master Qin looked at the little girl in front of him and couldn’t help but remind her, “Don’t be so kind to strangers in the future.”

The little girl did not speak and gave a sweet smile.

He lived next door. Every day, he would see the adulterous couple forcing the little girl to work. It was winter, and the little girl didn’t have any thick clothes. He saw that the little girl had many frostbite injuries. In the end, he bought cotton clothes and cotton shoes for her.

Later on, that adulterous couple no longer cared about the little girl. His heart really ached for her, so he paid for her studies, taught her medicine, and began to nurture her.

Old Master Qin recalled the past and a happy smile appeared on his face as he thought about his previous life.

He hadn’t seen Qiao Nian in a long time, but he couldn’t see her yet.

“It’s still very dangerous for them in MY now.” Old Master Qin frowned. Although Qiao Nian wasn’t his biological daughter, he really treated her as his precious granddaughter.

“I’ve already gotten someone to protect them in secret.” As Gu Yue spoke, he looked at Old Master Qin. “Qin Chuan is also protecting them. You don’t have to worry. They definitely won’t be in danger.”
