1485 Sincerity

The bread smelled good. He finished a piece of bread before wiping the stain from the corner of his mouth with a tissue.

Amon stood at the side, his gaze on the man. What he saw in this man was his future.

Wright wiped the corner of his mouth clean and threw the tissue into the trash can. He asked coldly, “I’ll give you a chance. Do you want to embarrass me again?”

“No, no, no. Before I came, I already thought of a plan. Not only can I kill Qiao Nian, but I can also let you have the beauty!” the man said with a trembling voice.

When Wright heard the man’s words, his interest was piqued. He said, “How about this? I’ll give you another chance!”

“Thank you, Prince. Thank you, Prince. I will definitely complete the mission with my life!” The man kowtowed consecutively to Wright, his head hitting the floor.

“But…” Wright frowned slightly before saying, “I have to see your sincerity first.”

The man looked up shakily at Wright, not understanding what he meant.

Wright gave Amon a look. Amon understood tacitly and walked up to the man. He took out his knife and cut off the man’s left hand without hesitation!

“Ah!”

The man wailed loudly as blood flowed all over the floor.

Wright felt better when he heard the pleasant scream. He looked at the man kneeling on the ground. “Go and do it. If you do it well, you’ll be rewarded.”

The man broke out in a cold sweat from the pain, but he still kowtowed to Wright gratefully. “Thank you, Prince. Thank you, Prince.”

Compared to losing his life, losing a hand was nothing.

“However,” Wright raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at the man’s terrified face. He continued, “If you fail, I’ll get someone to cut off every piece of your flesh and feed it to the dogs!”

The man looked at Wright in fear. His lips parted slightly, as if he wanted to say something.

Wright waved at Amon.

Amon immediately understood and pulled the man down.

When the man was pulled out by Amon, his triangular eyes were filled with killing intent. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Kill Qiao Nian, kill Qiao Nian, kill Qiao Nian!

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian were sitting at the dining table eating. Seeing Qiao Nian’s frown, he asked with concern, “What’s wrong? Are you feeling unwell?”

“What is it?” Gu Zhou asked.

Qiao Nian asked in confusion, “Don’t you think Lina looks a little familiar?”

Gu Zhou frowned slightly, as if he didn’t understand what Qiao Nian meant.

After some thought, Qiao Nian took out her phone, opened the photo of Shen An’s daughter, and handed the phone to Gu Zhou. “Don’t you think Lina’s eyes look a little like hers?”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he looked at the photo and said thoughtfully, “They do look a little alike.”

“It’s a pity that we can’t do a DNA test. Otherwise, we can confirm if Lina and Teacher Shen are related by blood.” Qiao Nian pursed her lips slightly, her eyes filled with disappointment.

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he picked up a piece of meat for her and said in a low voice, “Don’t think too much about it now. Let nature take its course.”

“Yes.” As Qiao Nian spoke, she put her phone away. “But I still feel a little homesick. If the president is really the person who kidnapped me, what exactly does he want to do? Does he just want to destroy the Gu and Lu families?”

Qiao Nian frowned and continued, “But that doesn’t seem right. He only dealt with Lu Qi and me. All four brothers are fine.”

Gu Zhou took a bite of rice and looked up at Qiao Nian. He said seriously, “The clues we’ve obtained are that the kidnapping twenty years ago is related to the President. This can also mean that people related to the President are involved.”
