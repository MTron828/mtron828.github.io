Chapter 172 Blessing Bag

With teary eyes, Jiang Yue lowered her gaze.

Grandma would never abandon her. Never!

Grandma had been angry in the past, but her anger would always dissipate after a few days.

Matriarch Gu looked at the servant who was carrying the box. Her gaze then fell on Qiao Nian’s face and she said gently, “Nian Nian, this gown is already ruined and can’t be worn anymore. Grandma will take it away for you. In the future, I’ll make another gown for

you.”

“Grandma, there’s no need. I’ll keep this as a memento!” Qiao Nian said with a smile.

“How can that be? This gown is already ruined.” Matriarch Gu frowned in disapproval.

“Grandma, you don’t have to worry about that. I’ll fix it. Even if it’s ruined, Grandma spent several nights preparing this gown specially for me. The love you sewed into this gown, stitch by stitch, is the most important thing to me,” Qiao Nian said.

When Matriarch Gu heard this, she was so touched that tears welled up in her eyes. Nian Nian was such an obedient and lovable young lady. She liked her more and more every passing day.

Zhao Qian stood at the side and smiled. “Grandma, do as Second Sister-in-law wishes!”

Suppressing her tears, Matriarch Gu nodded gently.

Seeing this, Jiang Yue’s heart felt empty. Her tears fell silently, and she turned to leave without saying anything.

Out of the corner of her eye, Matriarch Gu caught sight of Jiang Yue’s retreating back. A dozen emotions surged in her heart. Regardless of which perspective one took, these children were like her own flesh and blood. She doted on all of them equally.

However, Jiang Yue had gone too far this time. She just hoped that Jiang Yue could reflect on her actions and stop doing such things in the future.

At this moment, Matriarch Gu suddenly recalled something. She smiled at Qiao Nian and asked, “Nian Nian, do you know how to make a fortune bag for peace and blessings?”

“Yes.”

“Have you heard of the eldest daughter of the Lu family, who died young in her early years?” Matriarch Gu’s expression turned serious.

After Qiao Nian had met Lu Zhu, she had investigated the situation with the Lu family. She had also heard of the eldest daughter, who had passed away at a very young age. However, it wouldn’t be appropriate for her to know this, so she shook her head. “No.”

Matriarch Gu pulled Qiao Nian to sit down. Seeing this, Zhao Qian took all the servants away.

“The eldest daughter of the Lu family is a pitiful child. The poor girl. She was only two years old back then. Sigh. Just like that, she was gone.” When Matriarch Gu said this, her expression was full of sorrow.

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze. She didn’t have much of an opinion on these matters, so she quietly listened to Matriarch Gu speak.

“Now, it’s almost her birthday. In the past, I used to be the one making blessing bags for her.” Matriarch Gu lowered her head and looked at her hands. “Grandma is getting old. A few days ago, I used my hands continuously as well. I think my hands are a little weak now. I’m afraid Grandma won’t be able to make a good blessing bag. Can you help me make one?”

Qiao Nian nodded. “Okay, sure.”

“There’s still more than a week left. The date is the 13th of August. There’s enough time. When the time comes, help me send the fortune bag over,” Matriarch Gu said. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

When Qiao Nian heard Matriarch Gu’s words, she froze for a moment. Her birthday was also on this day. If that was the case, serendipity must have been involved in this. Perhaps she was destined to do something for the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

“Grandma, don’t worry. After I make the blessing bag, I’ll definitely recite the Earth Bodhisattva Sutra to pray for her,” Qiao Nian said with a serious expression.

When Matriarch Gu heard Qiao Nian’s words, a kind smile appeared on her face. “Alright. I always feel at ease after leaving things in your hands.”

Qiao Nian smiled.

Matriarch Gu gave some more instructions. After she was done, she stood up and said, “Sigh, I’m really getting old and useless. I’ll return to my room to rest first.”

“I’ll send you back!” Qiao Nian stood up and helped Matriarch Gu up.

“There’s no need. You have important things to do. Go ahead.” Matriarch Gu smiled and waved her hand.

“Okay.” Qiao Nian watched as Matriarch Gu left, her gaze gradually turning cold.

Before she made the blessing bag for Miss Lu, she had to return to the Qiao family home first. There were some things she had to figure out.
