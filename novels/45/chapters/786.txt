787 Puzzled

Gu Zhou shook his head. Suddenly, an idea flashed across his mind. He took out his phone and called Chen Qing.

“Second Young Master?”

“Chen Qing, do you have any photos of Chang Feng in the past?”

When Chen Qing heard Gu Zhou’s words, he immediately sat up.

Could Chang Feng have appeared again? Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Did that mean that Eldest Young Master had already returned?

“Could it be that Eldest Young Master and Chang Feng have returned?” Chen Qing couldn’t help but ask.

“I’m asking you!” Gu Zhou was getting impatient.

Chen Qing’s expression turned serious. He frowned and said, “I don’t have a photo of Chang Feng. He didn’t like to take photos in the past.”

Qiao Nian had been staying by Gu Zhou’s side the entire time, so she could hear Chen Qing’s voice on the phone.

Qiao Nian’s breathing quickened, and her heart jumped to her throat.

Gu Zhou noticed the change in Qiao Nian’s gaze. He looked at her and asked, “What did you discover?”

“Eldest Senior Brother really doesn’t like to take photos. That’s why I secretly took such a photo!” Qiao Nian said thoughtfully.

Gu Zhou frowned slightly and continued, “I remember that Chang Feng has asthma!”

Qiao Nian nodded and said, “In the past, he came to Grandpa’s house to treat his illness. Later on, he even studied medicine with Grandpa!”

Qiao Nian increasingly felt that Eldest Senior Brother and the Chang Feng Gu Zhou was talking about were the same person.

Moreover, she had indeed suspected that Eldest Senior Brother was in the Gu family, but she had never found him!

Now that he thought about it, Eldest Senior Brother should be thirty years old.

She had not seen Eldest Senior Brother for fifteen years.

Qiao Nian looked at Gu Zhou excitedly and asked, “Then do you know where Eldest Senior Brother is now?”

In the past, when she was at her grandfather’s house, Eldest Senior Brother doted on her the most!

Every time Eldest Senior Brother came back for the new year, he would bring her new clothes and delicious food.

She hadn’t seen Eldest Senior Brother in a long time. She missed him quite a lot.

“I’m looking for him too!” Gu Zhou said calmly.

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she was slightly stunned.

“He’s gone missing, and so has my brother. I’m looking for the two of them!” Gu Zhou’s eyes darkened.

Qiao Nian frowned slightly. She suddenly recalled how Gu Zhou had appeared in MY. She asked, “Were you looking for your brother back then?”

Gu Zhou felt that there was nothing to hide now. He said truthfully, “Yes!”

“Have you found anything, then?”

“I’ve only found this video. They seemed to have stayed there a year ago. I’m not sure now!”

When Qiao Nian heard Gu Zhou’s words, she lowered her gaze and couldn’t help but sigh.

“When did they disappear?” Qiao Nian asked.

“Five years ago!”

Qiao Nian pursed her lips tightly. She had received Eldest Senior Brother’s letter four years ago.

What she was sure of now was that Eldest Senior Brother was still alive and well. As for why he did not appear, she did not know.

Seeing that Qiao Nian was deep in thought, Gu Zhou pulled her into his arms and looked down at her. “Nian’er, you could have chosen not to marry me. Why did you marry me?”

Qiao Nian’s body was pressed against Gu Zhou’s. She felt a little uncomfortable and wanted to retreat a little, but she didn’t expect Gu Zhou to be pressed so tightly against her that she had no choice but to stand rooted to the ground.

Gu Zhou’s eyes were turbulent.

He still remembered when the lights in the small villa on the mountain had dimmed. Qiao Nian’s fear of him was still evident.

Someone who could react like this must have been hurt.

It was very likely that Qiao Nian had been hurt before.

Gu Zhou recalled Qiao Nian’s expression when she mentioned Chang Feng. His throat moved slightly. Could it be that Qiao Nian had been saved by Chang Feng after being wronged?

Gu Zhou really didn’t want his imagination to run wild, but his mind didn’t seem to listen to him. He frowned and enunciated each word clearly. “Nian’er, did you marry me for him?”

Gu Zhou’s voice was low and hoarse, with a hint of probing and gentleness.

Qiao Nian met Gu Zhou’s eyes and was about to refuse when she heard Gu Zhou say, “I want to hear the truth.”

Truth?

Gu Zhou was very sincere with her!

Qiao Nian’s breathing tightened and she heaved a sigh of relief. It seemed that this matter couldn’t be hidden any longer.
