Chapter 589: No?

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Sigh.” Matriarch Gu sighed. Her gaze fell on the window, her eyes filled with sorrow. Back then, if she had been more unyielding, Ah Zhou wouldn’t have become what he was now. Perhaps Ah Cheng wouldn’t have disappeared.

“Grandma.” Qiao Nian thought of the other personalities in Gu Zhou’s body and asked worriedly, “Is Gu Zhou’s aversion to women related to his mother?”

Gu Zhou’s aversion to women must have started when he was young.

Hearing Qiao Nian’s words, Matriarch Gu’s expression changed.

Nian Nian was really too smart. She could guess everything. There was no way to hide it.

Matriarch Gu pursed her lips tightly, as if she had thought of something. She sighed heavily and said, “Sigh, don’t ask about this anymore. Ah Zhou has already thought things through. I don’t want him to recall his past scars.”

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze. She didn’t think that Gu Zhou’s mental state was improving. Instead, she felt that Gu Zhou’s situation was precarious.

Some people already suffered a lot just by having another personality.

However, Gu Zhou had two other personalities.

Ignoring Zhou Zhou, Gu Chuan’s personality was very dangerous. If Gu Chuan came out often in the future, it might cause a lot of trouble.

Actually, Qiao Nian didn’t dare to ask Gu Zhou directly, because Gu Zhou wouldn’t tell her.

She wanted to ask the others in the villa, but they either didn’t dare to say or didn’t know.

The only person who knew about this and dared to say it was Matriarch Gu.

Qiao Nian hesitated for a moment before saying, “Grandma, what exactly happened to Gu Zhou in the past? I want to know about the past. That way, I can help treat Gu Zhou’s illness.”

Matriarch Gu reached out to hold Qiao Nian’s hand. Staring unblinkingly at her, she said earnestly, “Nian Nian, the past is in the past. Don’t think too much about it. The two of you look fine now.”

At this point, Matriarch Gu’s gaze gradually fell on Qiao Nian’s stomach. She frowned slightly. “Nian Nian, is there any progress with your stomach?”

Qiao Nian was stunned by Matriarch Gu’s words. Before she could speak, Matriarch Gu spoke again. “When will I be able to carry your great-grandchildren?”

“Well…”

Qiao Nian really wanted to cry. She and Gu Zhou were clean. How could she be pregnant?

Moreover, when Gu Zhou recovered, she would part ways with him. How could she be willing to have sex with him?

However, it wasn’t appropriate for her to say this in front of Matriarch Gu.

Matriarch Gu was a shrewd person. Seeing Qiao Nian stammer, she instantly grew nervous. “Don’t tell me Gu Zhou can’t do it!”

Qiao Nian’s ears instantly turned red!

How was it because of this?

She had never slept with Gu Zhou. How could she know if Gu Zhou could do it?

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian hurriedly said, “Grandma, it’s not what you…”

Before she could finish her sentence, there was a knock on the door.

Matriarch Gu looked up and said, “Come in!”

Gu Zhou pushed the door open and entered, closing it behind him.

The moment he entered, he realized that Grandma was staring unblinkingly at him. A trace of surprise flashed in his heart.

Didn’t Qiao Nian say that Grandma was in a bad mood?

Why was Grandma still staring at him?

What Matriarch Gu said next made Gu Zhou instantly understand.

“Ah Zhou, are you bad in that aspect?”

Matriarch Gu’s question was so straightforward that Gu Zhou was slightly stunned. He didn’t understand what was going on. He turned to look at Qiao Nian, wanting to get an answer from her eyes.

Qiao Nian wished she could find a hole to hide in.

“Why are you looking at Nian Nian? She didn’t say anything!” Matriarch Gu’s expression was cold. Seeing Gu Zhou sit down, she frowned.

“Grandma, where did you hear this from?”

“Don’t change the topic. Nian Nian’s reaction has already explained everything.” The more Matriarch Gu thought about it, the angrier she became. She had wanted to have a great-grandson, but her grandson couldn’t do that.

Gu Zhou frowned at Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian hurriedly explained, “I didn’t say anything.”

Gu Zhou gave Qiao Nian a meaningful look.
