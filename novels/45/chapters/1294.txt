1295 I can’t bear for you to cry

He couldn’t bear for Qiao Nian to suffer any grievances. How could he bear for Qiao Nian to suffer?

Qiao Nian looked at her empty hands. When she first got into the car, she had already sealed a few of Gu Zhou’s acupuncture points with silver needles to reduce his bleeding. Other than that, she didn’t know what else to do.

When she arrived at the hospital, Gu Zhou still had to be sent to the emergency room to remove the bullet. At that time, Gu Zhou needed anesthesia. If she helped Gu Zhou relieve the pain now, the anesthesia would wear off before Gu Zhou’s surgery was over.

This was the first time she felt that she was too weak to take good care of Gu Zhou.

At the thought of this, Qiao Nian’s tears fell one by one.

Gu Zhou felt terrible from the pain. A drop of water seemed to have appeared on the back of his hand, as if it was wet. He opened his eyes and saw Qiao Nian sitting at the side, silently crying.

Gu Zhou blinked, and his vision gradually cleared. He focused all his strength on his right hand and gently wiped Qiao Nian’s tears.

As soon as his hand touched Qiao Nian’s face, she immediately sat up straight and looked at him.

He tried hard to smile, his voice weak. “Don’t cry. I can’t bear for you to cry!”

Seeing the smile on Gu Zhou’s face, Qiao Nian felt even worse. She would rather Gu Zhou cry to ease the pain. She wanted to speak, but she was sobbing uncontrollably.

“Don’t cry.” Gu Zhou’s vision was a little blurry. He blinked and said, “I’m really fine.”

“When I saw your injuries, I felt that you were in a lot of pain.” Qiao Nian sniffled and said pitifully.

Who wouldn’t feel pain when they were injured?

Gu Zhou just didn’t want her to worry, so he forced a smile! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“It really doesn’t hurt.” Gu Zhou was breathing less now, and his lips were trembling slightly. He waved at Qiao Nian and forced a smile. “Nian’er, come closer.”

Qiao Nian raised her hand to wipe her tears and hurriedly moved closer to Gu Zhou. Just as she was about to speak, the man looked up and kissed her lips.

Qiao Nian’s mind went blank. Instinctively, she wanted to push Gu Zhou away, but when she realized that Gu Zhou was still injured, she forcibly held back. Just as she was about to look up and leave, Gu Zhou grabbed the back of her head.

Qiao Nian didn’t dare to move. She kept her eyes open, looking at Gu Zhou.

Gu Zhou’s face was pale. She could clearly see Gu Zhou’s long eyelashes and the veins on his forehead. She hesitated for a moment, then slowly closed her eyes and reached out to hold the back of Gu Zhou’s head, hoping that he wouldn’t have to look up forcefully.

She remembered a thesis mentioning that kissing could relieve pain.

Oh my, another day of blessings for someone else’s love.

After a long while, Gu Zhou let go of Qiao Nian. He looked at Qiao Nian and was about to speak when he fainted again.

Seeing Gu Zhou like this, Qiao Nian subconsciously took his hand, trying hard to remain calm.

Although Gu Zhou’s pulse was a little weak, his life was no longer in danger.

Qiao Nian heaved a sigh of relief. She looked up at the nurse and asked, “Miss Nurse, when you were cleaning his wound just now, did you see the bullet? Can you tell how deep it was?”

The nurse glanced at the bandaged area on Gu Zhou’s abdomen and said with a serious expression, “Madam, I didn’t see the bullet in your husband’s abdomen from the outside. There are two possibilities. The first is that the bullet should be deeper, and the second is that the bullet has already been pulled out. However, it’s not easy for us to judge this situation. I’ve already stopped the bleeding for your husband. When the hospital takes a scan, we’ll be able to confirm if the bullet is still in his body.”

Qiao Nian frowned deeply. Just now, Gu Zhou had been engaged in a gunfight with the people from Kan Mountain. He probably didn’t have time to pull out the bullet. It seemed that the bullet had already deeply entered his body.

How had he endured such pain?

Qiao Nian pursed her lips tightly. Looking at the unconscious Gu Zhou, she reached out and held his hand. Slowly, she closed her eyes, praying that Gu Zhou would be fine.

The nurse sat at the side and looked at the young couple silently. She sighed helplessly. The man’s injuries were very serious. She didn’t know if he could be saved.

She hoped that the lovers would eventually get married!
