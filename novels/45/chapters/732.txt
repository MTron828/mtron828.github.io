733 Take Her Home!

Lu Rao lowered his gaze slightly and clenched his fists tightly. “Brother, I have the ability to protect Sugar now.”

“Ah Rao, I believe in your ability, but some things aren’t as simple as you think. What if those people secretly attack Sugar?” Lu Zhu paused for a moment and continued, “Now that we know that Sugar is still alive, this is already a blessing in disguise. What we have to do is protect Sugar’s life. It’s better than bringing her back to the Lu family now!”

Lu Rao naturally understood what Lu Zhu meant. Thinking of Qiao Nian’s back as she left, his voice couldn’t help but turn hoarse. “Brother, I want to look for Sugar. I want to talk to her more.”

“There will be plenty of opportunities in the future!”

Lu Rao nodded, still feeling a little lonely.

If he had known that Qiao Nian was Sugar, he would have taken her out to play.

However, Lu Rao quickly recalled something serious. He had to investigate that incident from more than twenty years ago again.

Lu Zhu looked at Lu Rao’s gaze and knew what he was thinking. He comforted him softly, “Sugar is safer alive than if she returns to the Lu family now. As long as we find those people, we can let Sugar return to the Lu family openly and without any harm.”

Lu Rao nodded. He seemed to have thought of something. His gaze landed on Lu Zhu’s face and he asked, “Brother, did you investigate that matter?”

At the mention of this, Lu Zhu frowned.

After he returned to the Lu family, he had already gotten someone to investigate that matter.

Back then, the forensic doctor had already logged in his name for the DNA test on his sister.

Logically speaking, this matter should be easy to investigate.

But life was unpredictable.

“The forensic doctor who did the DNA test for his sister back then is already sixty-eight years old this year and has amnesia. He doesn’t remember anything from the past.”

When Lu Rao heard Lu Zhu’s words, he thought for a while and said, “Looks like it’s not a good idea to use the forensics method. Did you ask Uncle Quan back then?”

Of course, Lu Zhu had also thought of the clues Lu Rao had thought of. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

When he found out that the forensic doctor’s lead had been cut off, he went straight to Uncle Quan.

At that time, Uncle Quan was a police officer in An City, and he had personally been involved. His father had a good relationship with Uncle Quan.

Lu Zhu nodded.

“Then what did Uncle Quan say?” Lu Rao asked.

“Uncle Quan only told me about the general process of this case. It’s about the same as what we knew previously. Moreover, when Uncle Quan found Sugar’s Limb, he immediately got someone to send it to the forensic doctor for examination!”

“The rest of the matter was how he found out about the people who kidnapped Sugar and executed them. At that time, I didn’t dare to ask too much. I was worried that the walls had ears. I was also afraid that those people would find out that Sugar was still alive and want to kill her.”

Lu Rao nodded. Indeed, he could not ask too much. If he asked too much, others would notice that they were acting abnormally. It seemed that this matter could only be investigated secretly.

Lu Rao looked up at Lu Zhu and said, “Brother, continue investigating the people who handled the Sugar case. I’ll investigate the others.”

When Lu Zhu heard Lu Rao’s words, he frowned slightly and asked in confusion, “Then how do you plan to investigate?”

Lu Rao smiled lightly, his eyes emitting a chill. He raised his eyebrows slightly. “Of course, we’ll investigate the families of the three murderers first. I think they should know some clues.”

Lu Zhu frowned slightly and said, “Don’t use be too violent. I’m afraid others will find out.”

Lu Rao smiled brightly and said, “Brother, don’t worry. I’ll definitely do this without anyone knowing!”

As long as it involved his sister, he did not dare to be careless.

…

In the car.

As the car drove ahead, Gu Zhou glanced at Qiao Nian from the corner of his eye.

At this moment, Qiao Nian was holding a document in her hand. Her gaze fell on the window. She recalled that when they were in the Buddhist hall just now, Matriarch Lu’s health seemed to have worsened. Matriarch Lu was her biological grandmother.
