1383 Not Easy to Investigate

Qiao Nian asked gently, “Did you only tell her?”

Lu Qi shook her head and said seriously, “There are others. I believe Sister Song Yu will never tell outsiders. She treats me so well. When Sister Song Yu and I returned home, Mom and Grandma were watching television in the living room. I told them about this too. During dinner tonight, my brothers all found out!”

Lu Qi pondered for a moment and continued, “Auntie Cao was also present at dinner. Uncle Zhao, Xiao Ya, and Da Miao were also present.”

Qiao Nian frowned. Why were there so many people? She had thought that she would have an idea of the culprit soon, but in the end, several butlers and servants of the Lu family knew about this.

The fewer people there were, the easier it would be to investigate. However, with so many people around, it was really not easy to investigate.

Qiao Nian pursed her lips slightly. It seemed that this matter was really not easy to investigate!

Lu Zhu said, “Auntie Cao and Uncle Zhao are both old people in the family. They shouldn’t do such a thing. Xiao Ya is the daughter of my mother’s butler. She grew up with us. She doesn’t seem to be someone who does such a thing.”

Lu Qi nodded in agreement and added, “Yes, yes. Da Miao’s father is Dad’s bodyguard, and he’s also someone who knows everything about the family. They’re all family members. They are very hardworking. There are many things that we don’t need to arrange and they’ll take the initiative to do it in advance.”

Lu Nian frowned slightly and said hesitantly, “Could it be that they told someone else and someone else spread these words?”

When Qiao Nian heard their words, she felt that this matter was in a mess again. It seemed that it would be very difficult to investigate the traitor.

“Auntie Cao?” When Qiao Nian heard this name, she found it a little familiar. She asked curiously, “Auntie Cao was the one who previously suspected my identity?”

“Yes.” Lu Zhu nodded.

Lu Qi looked at Qiao Nian’s expression and recalled that Auntie Cao had previously doubted that Qiao Nian wasn’t the eldest daughter of the Lu family. She said softly, “Sister, Auntie Cao doesn’t speak politely, but she’s quite kind. When I was young, she was the one who took care of me. When I was sick, she was so anxious that she couldn’t sleep for a few days. I keep feeling that she won’t harm me.”

Lu Zhu and Lu Nian did not speak. They had been raised by Auntie Cao.

Some time ago, they had gotten into an argument with Auntie Cao in the ancestral hall, but Auntie Cao wouldn’t have done such a vicious thing.

However, if Auntie Cao was really behind that incident, they would never let her off.

However, they hoped that Auntie Cao didn’t do this.

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze. Now that there were no clues about this matter, it wasn’t appropriate for her to suspect anyone. She said, “Then investigate slowly. When the time comes, we’ll see who has a guilty conscience when they see Qi Qi. It might be that person.”

Lu Qi sat there in a low mood, her eyes red-rimmed. She really hadn’t expected someone in her family to want her to die just because she had told them that she wanted to acknowledge Old Master Qin as her master and prepare to pay respects to her ancestors.

This time, she had even implicated Senior Brother. Senior Brother was still in the operating theater because of her.

Lu Qi stared unblinkingly at the operating theater in the distance. She prayed in her heart that Senior Brother would be safe.

Qiao Nian naturally understood what Lu Qi was worried about. She reached out and hugged Lu Qi. Fortunately, Qin Chuan was around this time. Otherwise, she might have lost her only sister.

Hurried footsteps came from the end of the corridor.

“Qi Qi!”

Song Yu’s hair was in a mess, and her face was flushed red. She jogged in her high heels, her windbreaker almost falling to her shoulders.

“Sister Song Yu,” Lu Qi called out weakly. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Song Yu ran to Lu Qi and squatted down. She sized her up carefully and pulled her into her arms. With a sobbing tone, she said, “Fortunately, I’m fine. You scared me to death…”

Towards the end, Song Yu was already sobbing uncontrollably, and her body was trembling.

Without batting an eyelid, Qiao Nian retracted her hand from Lu Qi’s body. She looked down at the shoes on Song Yu’s feet. They were a pair of black high heels, covered in mud. The stockings on Song Yu’s feet had already been torn, but Song Yu didn’t seem to notice this.
