Chapter 611: Scared

Of course, Chen Qing could only think about these complaints in his mind. In reality, he didn’t dare to say them at all.

If he dared to say anything, the snake would probably be fed with his flesh.

Chen Qing couldn’t help but glance at the wound on Second Young Madam’s mouth. Speaking of which, he really hadn’t expected Second Young Master to do such a thing.

Of course, Su Sheng also noticed the wound on Qiao Nian’s mouth. Her eyes lit up. No wonder they had been able to enter the Gu family villa without obstruction. So Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou were not just doctor and patient.

Su Sheng hurriedly changed the topic. “Let’s go see the child now!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Okay.” Qiao Nian spoke openly, looking very calm. The three of them walked upstairs together.

She seemed to have thought of something and said in a low voice, “Doctor Su, can I trouble you to just treat me as a friend who came over to say hi to him? I’m worried that he’ll feel uncomfortable.”

Su Sheng also knew that autistic patients were very sensitive. She smiled and said, “Miss Qiao, okay. I understand your concerns.”

“Thank you,” Qiao Nian said softly.

When she reached the stairs, Qiao Nian recalled that Gu Zhou was still sleeping. She said softly, “Let’s be gentler.”

When Su Sheng heard Qiao Nian’s words, she didn’t understand what she meant at all. However, she still lightened her footsteps.

Chen Qing blinked. Had Second Young Master fallen asleep again?

Just as the three of them walked upstairs, the door suddenly opened.

It was Gu Zhou’s room!

Qiao Nian’s expression changed slightly, turning serious. She was a little worried that it was Gu Chuan.

She would rather it be Gu Chuan and Gu Zhou who got up than Zhou Zhou.

If Su Sheng saw Zhou Zhou, she would be in big trouble in the future.

She gave Chen Qing a look and asked him to stop Su Sheng. She quickly walked towards the room. Before she took two steps, she saw Gu Zhou walking out of the room, frowning.

Su Sheng immediately stopped in her tracks. She had a very bad impression of Gu Zhou. She felt that this man was truly too terrifying.

Qiao Nian had just taken two steps when she stopped. Looking at Gu Zhou, she hurriedly said, “Are you still sleepy? Go in and sleep for a while.”

Before Gu Zhou could react, Qiao Nian had already walked up to him. Her clear fox-like eyes were filled with concern for him.

His eyes darkened. Lowering his gaze, he looked at Qiao Nian, who was standing in front of him. His hands, which were in his pockets, clenched involuntarily. His voice was low and hoarse. “You just got back?”

Gu Zhou’s voice was not soft, and the people nearby heard him.

Of course, Su Sheng heard everything clearly.

She looked at Gu Zhou in disbelief. She didn’t understand why Gu Zhou would ask such a question. Didn’t they just meet ten minutes ago?

Moreover, Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian had just spent a long time together. Was there something wrong with Gu Zhou’s memory?

Chen Qing was also stunned. He didn’t understand what was going on at all. His heart was in a mess.

Second Young Master was getting more and more terrifying. What should she do?

Qiao Nian was the calmest of the three. She knew that when Gu Zhou switched from his other personalities to Gu Zhou, Gu Zhou had no memory of what he had done to the other personalities.

A faint smile appeared on her face. She said gently, “Yes, I’m back.”

Gu Zhou gave an indifferent reply. His gaze inadvertently fell on Qiao Nian’s lips.

Had her lip been torn?

Realizing this, his brow furrowed uncontrollably, and his aura turned cold.

Not far away, Chen Qing and Su Sheng looked at Qiao Nian in surprise.

On the other hand, Chen Qing looked at Second Young Madam with heartache. How big of a heart did Second Young Madam have to be to be able to keep up with Second Young Master’s thoughts?

Su Sheng no longer felt that there was anything wrong with Gu Zhou. Instead, she felt that there was something wrong with Qiao Nian.

Could it be that everything that had just happened was fake?

Was there something wrong with her memory?

Su Sheng pursed her lips and her eyes filled with uncertainty.

Qiao Nian was worried that Su Sheng would sense something amiss. She wanted Gu Zhou to return to his room early, so she smiled at Gu Zhou and said, “This Miss Su is a psychiatrist I’ve invited. I want her to take a look at Little Qi.”
