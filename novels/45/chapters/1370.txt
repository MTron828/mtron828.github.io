1371 Quickly Wake Up

At the thought that Lu Qi was still alone in the dark tunnel, Qin Chuan quickly ran in. The darkness did not make him feel fear, because the person he loved the most was inside.

Qi Qi, don’t be afraid!

Qin Chuan ran faster and faster, leaving the woman outside the tunnel far behind.

The woman looked at Qin Chuan in confusion, not understanding why he had returned.

“Senior, Senior, wake up. Sob…”

Lu Qi’s cries in the tunnel made Qin Chuan’s heart ache. He ran faster and faster. Suddenly, he lost his footing and fell into a daze.

Suddenly, his eyes flew open, and intense pain instantly surged up. Qin Chuan gasped in pain.

“Senior!” When Lu Qi saw Qin Chuan open his eyes, she immediately smiled and moved closer to him, saying tearfully, “Do you know that I was especially afraid that you wouldn’t wake up? Fortunately, you woke up.”

Towards the end, Lu Qi’s tears streamed down her face. She sobbed pitifully.

Qin Chuan breathed heavily, his mind filled with what he had just thought of. Only then did he realize that if he really walked out of the tunnel, he might really be dead.

Qin Chuan’s gaze landed on Lu Qi’s face. Lu Qi was crying so hard that her eyes were red.

Lu Qi’s call just now had pulled his soul back from the edge of death.

Lu Qi raised her hand to wipe her tears and asked tearfully, “Senior Brother, does it hurt a lot? What should we do now?”

Qin Chuan shook his head gently and said, “I’m fine.”

Lu Qi finally stopped crying, but when she heard Qin Chuan’s words, her tears fell again. “Senior Brother, does it hurt a lot? I’m so silly. How can I ask such a thing? How can it not hurt when you were hit by a rock?”

Lu Qi raised her hand to wipe her tears. How much courage did Senior Brother have to protect her?

The more Lu Qi thought about it, the sadder she became. She said with a guilty expression, “Senior Brother, I’m sorry. It’s all my fault. Nothing good will happen when you meet me.”

She cried until she couldn’t breathe. She said sadly, “The first time, in order to save me, you were almost killed by Jiang Chi’s people. This time, for me…”

The more Lu Qi thought about it, the sadder she became. She felt that she shouldn’t appear in front of Qin Chuan. “In the future, let’s…”

“Shh.”

Before Lu Qi could finish speaking, Qin Chuan interrupted her.

Lu Qi blinked. There were still tears on her eyelashes. Caught off guard, she met Qin Chuan’s gentle gaze. Her heart felt as if it had been shot by a Cupid arrow of love.

Lu Qi’s face turned red uncontrollably. She hurriedly turned her head to the side and felt that her ears were burning, and her heart was beating violently.

“Qi Qi.”

When Lu Qi heard Qin Chuan’s weak voice, she hurriedly looked at him and said anxiously, “Senior Brother, what’s wrong? Are you feeling unwell?”

Qin Chuan’s breathing quickened. He swallowed and looked at Lu Qi in front of him, saying softly, “My face isn’t feeling well… cough cough…”

Qin Chuan hurriedly held his breath, lest he inhale dust and cough again.

“Alright, alright. I’ll help you clean up now.” Lu Qi hurriedly sat up on her knees and approached Qin Chuan’s face, carefully wiping it with her hand.

“Wet wipes.” Qin Chuan finally managed to spit out the word. He glanced at the armrest box in front of the front passenger seat.

Lu Qi followed Qin Chuan’s gaze and hurriedly leaned over to get a wet towel.

Qin Chuan looked at the busy Lu Qi and heaved a sigh of relief. If he didn’t get Lu Qi busy, she would probably continue to cry.

He couldn’t bear for Lu Qi to cry.

Lu Qi opened the armrest box and saw wet wipes and some snacks. She looked at Qin Chuan in surprise.

She had a nagging feeling that Senior Brother didn’t seem to like snacks.

“I was afraid that you would be bored on the road, so I prepared them for you…”

After Qin Chuan finished speaking, he couldn’t help but cough.

Lu Qi’s eyes turned red again. She took out a wet tissue and tried hard to remain calm. Only then did she move closer to Qin Chuan and help him wipe the dust and dried blood off his face.

He seemed to have lost a lot of blood.

When Lu Qi realized this, sadness surged in her heart, and her eyes couldn’t help but turn red. She turned her head to the side, wiped her tears, and tried hard to remain calm.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com
