Chapter 427: Generous

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Money was the most important thing in this place. It would be easy for them to kill him with money!

Sun Zhi said fearfully, “Ah… Ah, humans can’t eat rocks. If humans eat rocks, they’ll die!”

Ah Rao weighed the gravel in his hand and smiled. “Alright, everything can be discussed.”

When Sun Zhi heard this, he heaved a sigh of relief.

Ah Rao said lazily, “It’s fine if you don’t want to eat it. Then if he had to apologize to Miss Qiao now, and you he would have to call her Grandaunt ten times.”

Sun Zhi…

She was trying to trample all over his face.

If he really did as Gu Rao said, those people would definitely mock him when they saw him in the future. He would have no status in the future.

Seeing that Sun Zhi looked like he had nothing to live for, Ah Rao casually said, “You’re not willing to apologize, nor are you willing to call me grandaunt. That’s fine. Just eat this stone!”

“I—”

Sun Zhi stood together in a daze, unable to say a word.

The people at the side looked at Sun Zhi sympathetically. They did not feel good either. They knew that this young man had humiliated them by killing Sun Zhi.

Actually, not only had Sun Zhi lost face, but they had also lost face.

......

Sun Zhiting clenched his fists. He turned to look at the host for help, hoping that the host could stop Ah Rao.

Ah, the host left silently.

There was an unwritten rule in the world of stone gambling. If the more luxurious and expensive the jadeite was, the more such a person could not be provoked. Even Mr. Chen, who was standing here today, would not step forward to be the peacemaker.

Sun Zhi’s heart instantly turned cold. In all his years of life, this was the first time he had been so embarrassed. His gaze landed on Qiao Nian’s face, and he called out reluctantly, “Great Aunt!”

When Ah Rao heard Sun Zhi’s words, he retracted his gaze in satisfaction.

At the side, cold sweat broke out on Sun Zhi’s forehead. He clenched his fists and shouted again and again.

Those who hadn’t mocked Qiao Nian covered their mouths and giggled.

Gao Hong was very close to Qiao Nian. Every time Sun Zhi called her grandaunt, it was as if she was calling Qiao Nian. Her face alternated between green and white.

After Sun Zhi called out five times, Qiao Nian said, “Alright, that’s it!”

Sun Zhi was slightly stunned. He hadn’t expected Qiao Nian to let him off just like that.

The other onlookers were also stunned.

How could someone as generous as Qiao Nian, who didn’t add insult to injury, be a wild model who had relied on her body to climb up the ranks?

Sun Zhi was still feeling dizzy from anger just now, but now he was convinced. He sighed slightly and said, “Miss Qiao, I was rude just now. I was really blind to have said such words. I’m really sorry!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Qiao Nian looked at Sun Zhi’s sincere gaze and nodded slightly. This matter was over.

She was unfamiliar with this place and did not want to make enemies.

The host had a sweet smile on his face as he walked over and said, “Now, let’s congratulate Miss Qiao on obtaining the glass imperial jade!”

With a faint smile on her face, Qiao Nian said politely, “Thank you.”

Everyone’s gaze landed on Lu Zhu, who was standing not far away.

They had originally thought that Qiao Nian was just a small model by Lu Zhu’s side, and that she had come here to broaden her horizons.

However, they had never expected that Qiao Nian would become Lu Zhu’s strongest opponent.

The host said sweetly, “Everyone, if you’ve already chosen the raw stones, please cut them. I reckon the first round’s champion will be revealed soon!”

Hearing the host say this, everyone couldn’t help but feel nervous.

The critical moment had arrived.

When everyone brought the raw materials they had already picked to the cutting master, they watched solemnly as the raw materials they had chosen were cut open bit by bit.
