Chapter 159 Warmth

Seeing the young girl like this, Lu Zhu could not help but laugh. She had only greeted him with such enthusiasm to get her hands on the book.

Lu Zhu ruffled Lu Qi’s hair and handed the book to her. Just as he was about to speak, he saw Lu Qi handing the book to Qiao Nian.

“Teacher Qiao, this is my greeting gift to you. Although it’s very old, it’s my most beloved book. This book has allowed me to become who I am today. Though it may be a poor gift, I hope you’ll accept it.”

This book wasn’t expensive. It could be bought easily in a bookstore, but Lu Qi had a nagging feeling that Qiao Nian would indeed accept it.

Lu Zhu looked at Lu Qi in surprise. He had never expected Lu Qi to call him just now just to get him to send a book over.

He had thought that Lu Qi was going to give the book to Mrs. Gu. Because this book was treasured so much by Lu Qi, she had never been willing to give it away.

Qiao Nian lowered her gaze slightly and saw the words “The Kite Runner” on the cover. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Nian didn’t hesitate to take the book from Lu Qi. She felt extremely emotional. “Thank you for your gift. I’ll definitely treasure it well in the future.”

Actually, what Qiao Nian didn’t say was that this book was also her favorite book.

Seeing that Qiao Nian had accepted the gift, Lu Qi smiled happily. Then, she left with her friends and Lu Zhu.

Qiao Nian gazed at Lu Qi’s retreating back. She was such an innocent and adorable young lady. She must have grown up in a loving family. That must be why she grew up to be such a little angel.

Moreover, the two young ladies next to Lu Qi were also obedient and adorable.

Birds of a feather indeed flock together.

Qiao Nian’s lips curved up slightly. She looked away. There were five minutes left until the ceremony began. She had to get ready. Many people began entering the lecture hall. When they saw Qiao Nian standing outside the door, they were all astonished.

“Goodness, this girl is so beautiful!”

“She’s today’s first lecturer!”

“I’m so looking forward to it. I really want to know what kind of speech such a beautiful person will give.”

Not far away, as Jiang Yue listened to everyone praise Qiao Nian, she felt as if a huge rock was pressing down on her chest, suffocating her.

What made Jiang Yue speechless was that Qiao Nian was wearing an evening gown of the same color as hers. She was clearly trying to steal her thunder.

Qiao Nian’s waist was very small, and she had beautiful straight shoulders and butterfly bones. Her skin was very fair, and in contrast to the black gown, it looked even fairer.

“She looks like a fairy!”

“Qiao Nian is so pretty. Her figure is amazing. That black gown suits her very well, making her look like an angel.”

“By the way, don’t you think Senior Jiang Yue’s gown is a little too small? Don’t tell me that gown really belongs to Qiao Nian!” “Who knows? Just now, I thought Senior Jiang Yue looked good in that gown, but when I saw Qiao Nian, I felt that Qiao Nian looked better in comparison.” “Indeed. When they’re both wearing the same color, the one who looks worse will be humiliated!”

…

When Liu Yu heard those words, she frowned in dissatisfaction and said, “What a bunch of blind fools! Weaklings! Fence sitters!”

When Jiang Yue heard Liu Yu’s words, she consoled her softly, “Do stop talking. Let’s ignore them.”

“Yes, I’m waiting to see Qiao Nian make a fool of herself!”

Jiang Yue didn’t speak, her eyes glittering strangely. Lin Tao stood beside Qiao Nian. Hearing everyone’s words, and seeing the jealous looks on Jiang Yue and Liu Yu’s faces, she said smugly, “Those who scolded you just now are all won over by your beauty.” Qiao Nian smiled lightly and didn’t speak. She looked down at the book in her hand, her heart warming. She looked up, gazing around the lecture hall. Finally, she spotted Lu Qi in a corner.

Lu Qi was talking to Lu Zhu. Her starry eyes were filled with laughter, and the dimples at the corners of her lips were barely discernible. She was extremely adorable.

Similarly, Qiao Nian also spotted Gu Zhou, who was beside Lu Zhu. Gu Zhou looked up, and for a moment, their eyes met. Qiao Nian’s breathing quickened. Following Gu Zhou’s gaze, she looked down to see her fair and slender legs peeking out from under her gown.
