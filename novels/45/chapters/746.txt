747 IVF

“They were only willing to make test-tube babies!” At the thought of Gu Zhou’s birth, Matriarch Gu’s eyes grew redder and redder. She tried hard to suppress the tears in her eyes.

When Qiao Nian heard Matriarch Gu’s words, her heart couldn’t help but ache. It was as if she had been pricked by thousands of needles.

Gu Zhou, who had been born as his brother’s medicinal source, was an IVF baby.

Yet his mother had treated Gu Zhou so cruelly.

Some couples could only give birth through IVF. In their opinion, that child was also the manifestation of their love.

But Gu Zhou was different. He was just a medicinal source.

Everyone was looking forward to his birth not because they liked him, but because they wanted to use him.

“When his mother was pregnant with Ah Zhou, her mental state had always been poor. Later on, she took poison directly. The mother and son were in critical danger, and the doctor had no choice but to perform a Cesarean section. At that time, Ah Zhou was only eight months old.” As Matriarch Gu spoke, a tear fell uncontrollably down her cheek.

She seemed to have thought about the situation at that time, and was agitated and sad.

Gu Zhou had been born prematurely and was weak. He was sent to the incubator the moment he was born.

There was still the poison his mother took in his body. After more than a month of treatment, most of the poison had been eliminated, and he had barely survived.

It was precisely because of this that Gu Zhou had fallen ill.

The poison was really too difficult to remove. At that time, Ah Zhou’s mother had only managed to survive after three days and three nights of treatment. However, her mood was even worse than before.

When Qiao Nian heard Matriarch Gu’s words, she couldn’t help but frown.

Gu Zhou’s mother was willing to give up her grudges to get pregnant and have a child for Gu Yue. This meant that she really liked Gu Yue and cared about him.

If that was the case, why had Gu Zhou’s mother taken the poison again?

Could it be depression?

Or had someone else poisoned her?

If Gu Zhou died, Gu Yue would not be able to live either. The two children of the Gu family would be gone. This was a good thing for the others who were keeping an eye on the Gu family.

Qiao Nian asked, “Grandma, did she take the poison on purpose back then, or…”

“I investigated it. She accidentally ate it.” Matriarch Gu sighed heavily.

When Qiao Nian heard Matriarch Gu’s words, her frown deepened. She felt that this matter wasn’t that simple.

“Nian Nian, I know what you’re thinking. Back then, I also suspected that there was something else going on, but I got someone to investigate. In the end, I found out that she really ate it by mistake. Moreover, in order for Gu Zhou to grow up safely and healthily, her mother raised Gu Zhou by her side.”

Qiao Nian nodded. Since Matriarch Gu had already investigated, there shouldn’t be any problems.

Sigh.

Everything was a joke.

Gu Zhou’s upbringing had been so bumpy.

Everyone knew that Gu Zhou was weak and had always lived in the countryside. It seemed that Gu Zhou had been supervised and imprisoned by his mother in the past.

Gu Qi was Gu Zhou’s child. Gu Qi was so smart. It seemed that Gu Zhou must have been smart as well when he was young.

When Gu Zhou was young, he was not in good health. He must have known what his mother was thinking. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Matriarch Gu had also said that Gu Zhou’s mother’s emotions were unstable. Perhaps Gu Zhou had even withstood all the stress his mother had vented on him.

Gu Zhou still had to provide his brother with bone marrow. His health was not good to begin with, and it was even worse if he thought too much.

Most importantly, Gu Zhou had probably never received maternal love.

Now, Qiao Nian finally understood why he had the personality of Zhou Zhou.

A child who yearned for maternal love, and was not a medicinal source for his brother.

However, at that time, Gu Zhou’s mother’s emotions were unstable and she could not take good care of Gu Zhou.

Therefore, Gu Zhou had been alone since he was born.

No wonder when she first came to the Gu family, Gu Zhou had always suspected that she had ulterior motives when he found out that she had married into the Gu family on behalf of Qiao Xin.

It wasn’t that Gu Zhou was delusional about being persecuted, but the environment he was in proved that he wasn’t safe at all.

If she were Gu Zhou, she would probably think the same.

After all, even his mother didn’t love him. Who else could he expect to be true to him?
