976 Exercise for a while?

Lu Zhu’s heart ached for Sugar. All these years, Sugar had not been doing well at all and had even been bullied. Some time ago, an imposter like Song Man even wanted to replace Sugar.

Sigh, when would their Sugar be able to live like a happy princess?

Lu Zhu recalled that Lu Jiang had also said that He Cheng wanted to bully Sugar. At that time, he wanted to cripple He Cheng.

Sugar called. Instead of telling him that she was in danger, she mentioned giving Lu Qi a gift.

Sugar made one’s heart ache even more.

Lu Zhu’s eyes were filled with heartache. Since Sugar wouldn’t tell him, he wouldn’t ask anymore, lest he ruin her mood.

“Lu Qi? She usually likes to read and collect books,” Lu Zhu said with a smile.

When Qiao Nian heard this, she understood. Thinking that Lu Qi was also a medical student and should be interested in medicine, she had already thought of what gift to give her.

“Brother, I’ll go get ready first. Thank you, Brother!” Qiao Nian said happily.

Qiao Nian had just hung up when the bathroom door opened. She subconsciously looked over and saw Gu Zhou walking out in a bathrobe.

His hair was wet and dripping with water. Water droplets fell on his face, then onto his well-defined chest.

Silently, she looked away. This man’s figure was too good. Her mouth went dry. She couldn’t help but think of everything that had happened last night.

Her face instantly turned red.

At this moment, Gu Zhou walked towards her.

Qiao Nian immediately stood up and said seriously, “I’m going out to buy something now. After that, I’ll go straight home!”

Before Qiao Nian could take two steps, her arm was grabbed. Before she could react, Gu Zhou pinned her against the wall.

Gu Zhou looked down at Qiao Nian’s face, his gaze deep and doting. “Are you shy?”

Qiao Nian had never seen anyone who didn’t know how to chat so well. This sentence was enough to kill the conversation. She wanted to push Gu Zhou away, but her hand inadvertently landed on his chest.

It was wet and smooth. The texture of his muscles was very good, and it felt especially good to the touch.

She pretended to be calm and immediately retracted her hand. “Hurry up and put on your clothes. It’s cold. Don’t catch a cold again!”

Gu Zhou smiled at Qiao Nian’s small actions. His lips curved up slightly as he asked, “Are you cold?”

His voice was low and hoarse. He was so sexy that it sounded like an orgasm.

Before Qiao Nian could answer, she heard Gu Zhou say, “I heard that you’ll warm up after exercising. Why don’t I take you for some negative distance exercise?”

What f*cking negative distance exercise.

He clearly wanted to have sex, but he still made it sound so nice!

Qiao Nian’s shyness instantly disappeared. She was filled with anger. She looked up and met Gu Zhou’s deep eyes.

His eyes seemed to have a magical power. As long as they met, she couldn’t help but sink into them.

Qiao Nian recalled those ambiguous scenes again. Her heart couldn’t help but race. Her mouth was dry as she licked her lips and said, “No, there’s no need.”

Seeing her lick her lips, Gu Zhou’s eyes gradually darkened. He lowered his head slightly and kissed her lips lightly. “It tastes good.”

“What taste?” As soon as Qiao Nian finished asking, she instantly understood what Gu Zhou was talking about. She glared at him.

This man was too shameless!

Gu Zhou smiled and said gently, “Go ahead!”

Qiao Nian nodded and turned to walk out. After taking two steps, she seemed to have thought of something and turned to look at Gu Zhou. “We haven’t been home for more than a day. Grandma and the children must be very anxious. Go back first and say that we’re busy with the company.”

Qiao Nian thought to herself, “You’re really not a good mother. You actually lied to the children!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Yes, I understand.” With that, Gu Zhou seemed to have thought of something and said again, “But I think the two children might not believe me.”

“Huh?” Qiao Nian raised her eyebrows slightly, not understanding what Gu Zhou meant.

“They’re not stupid,” Gu Zhou said calmly.

Qiao Nian was speechless.

“I’ll tell them that Mom and Dad are handling our own matters.” Gu Zhou wiped his hair with a towel. The indolence and nobility he exuded with every move was inexplicably sexy.
