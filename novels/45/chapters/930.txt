931 Clown

Qiao Xin really felt that Song Man was the eldest daughter of the Lu family. The DNA report was an ironclad fact. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Lu Zhu handed the report to Qiao Xin. He raised his eyebrows and asked, “Is she worthy?”

The blood drained from Qiao Xin’s face. She looked at Lu Zhu in disbelief.

Didn’t everyone in the Lu family care a lot about the eldest daughter of the Lu family?

Why would Lu Zhu say that?

“But she’s the eldest daughter of the Lu family!” Qiao Xin said carefully, her mind in a mess. She didn’t understand what had gone wrong.

There was a trace of disdain on Lu Zhu’s face, and his voice was filled with anger. “Song Man is just a clown. Although her blood is the same as my sister’s, does she think she can replace my sister so easily? Does she think our Lu family is stupid? Won’t we discover her problem? She’s simply delusional!”

Qiao Xin looked at Lu Zhu in confusion, her frown deepening. Confusion was written all over her face. “What do you mean by that? Why don’t I understand?”

Lu Zhu took out his phone, found a photo, and handed it to Qiao Xin.

Qiao Xin looked at Lu Zhu’s phone in confusion. It was a photo of a DNA test.

But when Qiao Xin saw the names of the two people on the DNA test, her eyes widened in fear.

How was that possible?

It was actually the DNA report of Qiao Nian and Lu Zhu.

Qiao Nian and Lu Zhu were actually siblings?

Jesus.

How was this possible?

Qiao Xin felt as if all her strength had been drained out of her. She felt dispirited. Her legs gave way, and she almost fell to her knees.

Qiao Xin tried hard to remain calm. She couldn’t believe that the Qiao Nian she had always looked down on was actually the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

She felt as if she had been slapped hard in the face.

“No, no, this report must be fake!” Qiao Xin shook her head frantically, her eyes darkening.

Qiao Nian, who she had always treated like a country bumpkin, couldn’t possibly be the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

Qiao Nian must have long discovered that Song Man was the eldest daughter of the Lu family, so she forged this DNA report.

That’s right. It must be what she thought.

After all, Qiao Nian was an unscrupulous person.

Qiao Xin was not a brainless person. She hurriedly said, “Mr. Lu, I’m sure this DNA report was faked by Qiao Nian. It’s also possible that she played a role in Song Man’s bone marrow transplant!”

Qiao Xin knew a lot about medicine. She had even studied DNA, and had was a lot of knowledge about DNA identification.

Seeing Lu Zhu’s expression darken, Qiao Xin knew that he believed her. She continued, “Song Man isn’t in good health and often takes medicine. I heard that in the past, in order to survive, she donated bone marrow and kidneys.”

Actually, Qiao Xin didn’t know what medicine Song Man was taking, but by saying this, she could get Lu Zhu to investigate.

Lu Zhu looked at Qiao Xin coldly. He put his phone away indifferently and placed it in his pocket. Looking at Qiao Xin, who was on the verge of breaking down, a trace of indifference flashed across his face.

“I’ve long known the truth,” Lu Zhu said expressionlessly. “Song Man has come this far because she’s selfish. If she didn’t have a guilty conscience, why would she jump down from the windowsill?”

What?

Song Man jumped off the building herself?

Qiao Xin looked at Lu Zhu in disbelief. She couldn’t believe that Song Man had jumped off the building herself.

Why did Song Man commit suicide?

She was clearly the eldest daughter of the Lu family.

As long as she endured it, she would be able to get what many girls dreamed of.

Qiao Xin shook her head. “Mr. Lu, you must have been deceived by Qiao Nian. Qiao Nian is a cunning person. She never tells the truth!”

“I know very well who my sister is! I don’t want to hear any scandals that are harmful to Qiao Nian anymore!”

Qiao Xin’s eyes instantly turned red. She met Lu Zhu’s cold eyes, which showed his 100% trust in Qiao Nian.

Why?

How could Qiao Nian really be the eldest daughter of the Lu family?

If Qiao Nian was the eldest daughter of the Lu family, then wouldn’t what she had done in the past have completely offended the Lu family?
