1470 Destruction

Wright had thought it through. Lina was poisoned now. If they wanted the antidote, those people could only come to him. At that time, he could take the opportunity to get engaged to Lina. Lina would be his from now on.

Wright walked up to the French window and kicked it hard. As he was still angry, he walked to a table and pulled the tablecloth hard, spilling all the food on the table onto the ground.

“Trash, call the doctor over now. I want to ask what poison he made. Others can easily make the antidote!” Wright shouted.

The assistant answered weakly, “Yes.” Then, he left.

Wright was the only one left in the room. He frantically smashed everything beside him and cursed loudly.

…

The President and Gu Zhou walked to a lounge in the hospital. There were only the two of them in the room.

The President stood with his hands behind his back and looked at Gu Zhou with a sharp gaze. He asked indifferently, “In our country, you’re not allowed to establish an army on your own. If you violate this rule, you’ll be punished due to treason and collusion with the enemy. You’ll be killed without mercy!”

Gu Zhou looked at the President calmly and raised his eyebrows slightly. He said lightly, “I think the President has misunderstood. They’re just bodyguards I hired.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The president snorted. He wasn’t blind. There were so many mercenaries, all of them in an orderly manner. On the surface, they were mercenaries, but in reality, they should be from the army.

Gu Zhou had actually brought an army to Europe this time!

Realizing this, the president narrowed his eyes slightly and looked at Gu Zhou with a complicated expression. What exactly was he doing here?

It was rumored that Gu Zhou was not in good health. Gu Zhou spent most of his time in the Gu family villa in An City. He did not even go to the company much.

However, Gu Zhou, who was standing in front of him, looked strong. Could it be that his Madam had helped him recuperate?

It seemed that Madam Gu’s medical skills were very brilliant.

The president recalled how Lina had looked when she was lying unconscious on the hospital bed. Qiao Nian only inserted a few needles into Lina’s body, and she had woken up very quickly.

Perhaps Qiao Nian could really treat his Madam’s illness?

Once again, his attention was on Gu Zhou. Anyone with a discerning eye would understand that Gu Zhou’s so-called mercenaries were from the army.

Did Gu Zhou expose his strength on purpose, or was it because the situation was urgent and there was no time to hide it?

The president felt that Gu Zhou must have deliberately exposed his strength.

“My wife likes Europe, so I brought her here for a vacation.” Gu Zhou’s thin lips curved up slightly as he lied sincerely.

“My wife and I are here for a vacation, and business reasons. As for the complicated situation of the European royal family, there’s no need for us to know about this at all,” Gu Zhou said lightly, as if he was really here for a vacation.

The President’s gaze fell on Gu Zhou’s face. He saw that Gu Zhou’s gaze was cold, calm and unfathomable.

He still remembered that ten hours ago, when he had threatened Gu Zhou with a gun, Gu Zhou had also looked so calm, as if nothing would arouse his emotions.

The president sighed slightly in his heart. If Wright was really as outstanding as Gu Zhou, he really wouldn’t mind marrying Lina to Wright.

But Wright was a despicable person, an unpresentable beast.

If Wright had pursued Lina openly, he wouldn’t hate Wright so much.

But in order to achieve his goal, Wright had used such a vicious method to force Lina to marry him.

How could he marry his precious daughter to a beast?

The president narrowed his eyes slightly, his blue eyes instantly filled with coldness.

He couldn’t be bothered to test Gu Zhou anymore. Without hesitation, he said, “Now, in order to become the next heir, the members of the royal family are all unscrupulous. Even if you don’t want to interfere in the internal conflict of the royal family, I’m afraid after today’s incident, they’ll still think that you’re on my side.”
