Chapter 405: Too Loud!

Hearing Song Yue’s words, Qiao Nian frowned and said impatiently, “Do you believe me? If you say another word, I’ll throw you down!”

When Song Yue heard Qiao Nian’s words, she was slightly taken aback. A disdainful smile appeared on her face. “Qiao Nian, aren’t you being too arrogant? Look at yourself!”

“It’s too noisy.” Qiao Nian’s beautiful fox eyes narrowed slightly.

Song Yue continued, “When we get off the plane later, I’ll definitely…”

Before Song Yue could finish speaking, she felt a sharp pain in her ear. Her expression changed abruptly, and only then did she notice that Qiao Nian had stuck a needle into her ear.

She was in so much pain that she was drenched in cold sweat. Her face was pale as she looked at Qiao Nian. Just as she was about to speak, she felt as if her brain was being stabbed by thousands of needles. It was so painful that tears streamed down her face.

With an indifferent expression, Qiao Nian retracted the silver needle and said, “Shut up for two hours and it won’t hurt anymore. If you still want to talk, don’t blame me for not reminding you. You might become mute in the future. You better behave yourself now!”

Song Yue looked at Qiao Nian with resentment. She lowered her eyes slightly and stopped talking. She stole a glance at Lu Zhu, who was sitting not far away, hoping that he would stand up for her.

Lu Zhu frowned and retracted his gaze. His gaze landed on Song Yue’s face. “When we get off the plane, ask Lin Nan to arrange for you to return to An City. You don’t have to follow me anymore!”

From the beginning, Lu Zhu did not like Song Yue following him. If his grandmother had not said that Song Yue knew how to gamble on stones, he would not have agreed.

Even if Song Yue was talented, he didn’t need such a woman.

Song Yue looked at Lu Zhu in disbelief. She had never expected him to chase her back for a gold digger.

Song Yue’s aggrieved tears fell uncontrollably, but she couldn’t say a word.

In the country, Song Yue was also famous in the stone gambling world. It was precisely because of this that she could persuade Grandma Lu to come with Lu Zhu.

However, all of this was destroyed by Qiao Nian.

What Song Yue didn’t understand was why Lu Zhu was speaking up for Qiao Nian when she was clearly the one who had done something wrong.

Moreover, Qiao Nian was his competitor!

At the thought of being pricked by Qiao Nian, Song Yue’s face turned red with anger.

This time, Qiao Nian sat calmly in her seat. Now that her surroundings were finally quiet, she felt much better.

Two hours later, the plane finally landed.

Qiao Nian and Lu Zhu walked side by side in front, while Song Yue followed behind, panting.

Song Yue jogged to Lu Zhu’s side in her high heels and glared at Qiao Nian with resentment. She temporarily gave up on arguing with Qiao Nian on the plane and said gently, “Brother Ah Zhu, don’t worry. I won’t say anything else this time!”

Without even looking at Song Yue, Lu Zhu said, “Lin Nan, send Miss Song back!”

Lin Nan quickly walked over and said to Song Yue politely, “Miss Song, your plane will take off in half an hour. You can go in and check in now.”

Song Yue’s expression suddenly changed, and she gritted her teeth. She was the daughter of the Song family, and had been very talented in mathematics since she was young. She was also quite famous in the international financial world.

Ever since she was young, everyone around her had always praised her and treated her respectfully. When had she ever suffered such grievances?

Ever since she had started pursuing Lu Zhu, her original pride had completely disappeared. She only hoped that Lu Zhu would take another look at her. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

However, Lu Zhu’s heart was like a rock. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn’t warm it up.

Even so, Song Yue still wanted to fight for herself. “Brother Ah Zhu, I’m already an adult. I don’t want to go back now. You can’t force me to. Since you don’t want to travel with me, I won’t follow you and disturb you.”
