Chapter 189: The Two-Faced Person’s Time to Shine

“If that’s the case, you might as well let me die in the hospital,” Qiao Nian said, enunciating each word.

Su Xue’s expression changed. She had an ominous feeling.

Qiao Nian asked again, “I’ll ask you one last time. Who are my biological parents?”

Su Xue was so angry that she was about to vomit blood. She had never expected Qiao Nian to not believe her. With her eyes as wide as dinner plates, she roared, “Qiao Nian, are you crazy? What good will it do me to lie to you at a time like this? Do you think I’m waiting to be struck by lightning?”

The more Su Xue thought about it, the angrier she became. “Back then, I gave birth to a dead baby. I was worried that Mother-in-law wouldn’t be able to take the blow, so I brought you back to raise you!”

Seeing that Qiao Nian was silent, Su Xue suddenly seemed to realize something. She smiled. “I see now. I understand why you’re not believing me. Are you still dreaming that you’re the daughter of a rich family?”

“If you’re really the daughter of a rich family, how could I have possibly taken you away from your parents? If they really care about you, how could they not have come looking for you after so many years? Think carefully! Use that brain of yours!” After Su Xue finished speaking, she suddenly felt happier. Even if her reputation was ruined, she had to make Qiao Nian suffer.

Qiao Nian kept staring into Su Xue’s eyes. She hoped to find evidence of a lie in Su Xue’s eyes, but she didn’t find any traces of Su Xue not telling the truth.

This meant that Su Xue was telling the truth.

Su Xue’s hair stood on end under Qiao Nian’s glare. The more she thought about it, the angrier she became. She didn’t intend to let Qiao Nian have an easy time either. “Qiao Nian, there’s no need for you to look at me like that. I’m telling the truth today. When I took you away, your mother said that she never wanted to see you again. She hoped that I would never bring you to visit her again. She still wanted to remarry and live a peaceful life. She didn’t want this mistake of hers to appear in front of her and disrupt her life!”

Qiao Nian looked at Su Xue quietly for a long time, her heart filled with complicated emotions. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

For the sake of her reputation, Su Xue would definitely not lie again.

Was her father really just a heartless man who wanted a son?

Her mother was an unethical mistress who ruined other people’s families.

Then, was she a universally hated illegitimate daughter?

Qiao Nian’s eyes turned cold. She felt that she had to investigate this herself.

Qiao Xin, who was standing at the side, couldn’t help but smile when she saw Qiao Nian’s expression grow worse and worse.

Qiao Nian had always prided herself on being morally superior.

Now, Qiao Nian was just the daughter of a village woman and a rich man. Moreover, she was an illegitimate daughter, despised by the world. She wanted to see what else Qiao Nian had to be proud of.

Qiao Nian was just a bastard child that no one wanted.

One needed skill and good karma to reincarnate. Qiao Nian had been inferior to her since she was born.

At the thought of this, Qiao Xin felt much better. She was the precious daughter of the Qiao family, and she had an outstanding older brother. Qiao Nian would never be able to compare to her.

She had won!

At the thought of this, Qiao Xin felt extremely happy, but she still put on a worried facade. “Sister, are… are you alright?”

Qiao Nian sat there in silence, seemingly lost in thought.

Out of the corner of her eye, Qiao Xin glanced at Gu Zhou. With the halo of an angel around her head, she said in a considerate and understanding manner, “Sister, in that era, it wasn’t easy for a woman if she got pregnant before marriage. It must have been really difficult for her to have a child and raise it. People would gossip about her. You have to understand your mother’s perspective. Don’t hate her.”

Qiao Nian still ignored Qiao Xin. Her mind was filled with Su Xue’s words.

After receiving so much information today, she needed to take some time to digest it. More importantly, she had to dig deeper into the matter and find key clues before she could get someone to investigate her background.

Seeing that Qiao Nian remained silent, Qiao Xin comforted her softly. “Sister, don’t keep quiet. Don’t take things too hard. Don’t worry, Brother and I will definitely help you!”
