1232 Disappointment

Xiao Bao looked at the results and frowned. His voice was a little low. “I thought I could hit the tenth ring. I didn’t expect it to hit the edge again.”

Xiao Bao had been practicing for the entire afternoon. Every time, he would wander between the first ring, the second ring, and the off-target. He clearly felt that he had already aimed for the tenth ring, but he didn’t expect the difference to be so great.

Mr. Chen walked up to Xiao Bao and squatted down. He looked gently into Xiao Bao’s eyes and said, “If you want to hit your target, you have to keep working hard to hit it. Don’t worry, do it again.”

Xiao Bao looked up at Mr. Chen, his grape-like eyes filled with confusion. He asked, “Did Daddy practice for a long time back then?”

“Of course.” Mr. Chen smiled at Xiao Bao, his gaze gentle. “I practiced for a long time back then.”

Xiao Bao looked at Mr. Chen. He nodded, not understanding, and picked up the gun again.

Mr. Chen stood back beside Chang Feng and looked at Xiao Bao’s serious face. He said, “Yes, hold it steady and aim it at the bullseye. Imagine that a bad person had taken the most important person to you hostage. Now, only you can save him. You only have one chance. If you fail, your family will leave you.”

Xiao Bao only wanted to experiment with the target practice. When he heard Mr. Chen’s words, he immediately became nervous. His forehead was covered in sweat. He gripped the pistol in his hand tightly and pulled the trigger.

Bang!

This time, Xiao Bao succeeded.

This time, Xiao Bao hit the sixth ring. Compared to the previous practice, his results were very good.

Chang Feng immediately applauded. He had never expected Xiao Bao to achieve such a good result!

When Mr. Chen saw Xiao Bao’s results, an old father’s gratified smile appeared on his face.

Xiao Bao was only five years old this year. This result was already very good!

Xiao Bao put down the pistol in disappointment and lowered his head. “Daddy, I’m sorry!”

The smile on Mr. Chen’s face froze. He looked at Xiao Bao in confusion and asked, “Why is Xiao Bao apologizing?”

“Daddy, I couldn’t save you!” The more Xiao Bao spoke, the sadder he became. He lowered his head. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Mr. Chen was confused.

When Chang Feng heard Xiao Bao’s words, he bent down and picked him up. “Xiao Bao, you just hit the sixth ring. That’s already very impressive!”

“Daddy was kidnapped by a bad person. I just hit a sixth ring. Perhaps I didn’t hit the bad person. If the bad person is alive, will he use violence on Daddy in a rage?” The more Xiao Bao spoke, the sadder he became. His eyes were already red. “What if Daddy dies?”

Mr. Chen was speechless.

This child was filial, but this wasn’t all!

Not only could he imagine what would happen if he didn’t hit the evil person, but he could also imagine that he was gone. For a moment, he didn’t know what to say.

“Daddy, if you’re gone, how will Xiao Bao live alone?”

Mr. Chen looked down at Xiao Bao’s teary eyes and felt terrible.

He had just made a hypothesis. Although he didn’t use him as an example, Xiao Bao had already imagined that he was the target.

Seeing that Xiao Bao was about to cry, Mr. Chen said, “Xiao Bao, I was just teaching you how to hit the bullseye. I wasn’t really kidnapped.”

When Xiao Bao heard Mr. Chen’s words, his eyes widened. He stared unblinkingly at Mr. Chen and nodded vigorously. “Daddy is right. Daddy is so powerful. How could he have been caught?”

This child had finally come around.

Mr. Chen continued, “Continue!”

Xiao Bao nodded. He picked up the gun in his hand and aimed it at the bull’s eye.

Chang Feng and Mr. Chen walked to the side. Chang Feng looked at Xiao Bao’s back and said softly, “Xiao Bao is really smart. He knows how to do it immediately after being taught.”

Mr. Chen’s eyes were filled with smiles, and his lips curved up slightly. Looking at Xiao Bao’s back, he suddenly saw the cold and silent Little Gu Zhou. He said softly, “He looks a lot like his father.”

After a pause, Mr. Chen couldn’t help but ask, “How’s his health?”
