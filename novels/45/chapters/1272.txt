1273 Dead Battery

“The battery is dead,” Chang Feng said calmly.

Only then did Xiao Bao react. He hurriedly ran down from the bed and walked to the table at the side. He quickly plugged in the charger and turned it on anxiously.

However, his phone didn’t respond at all. The power button didn’t seem to work.

Chang Feng slowly closed his eyes. When he opened them again, he said helplessly, “It’ll take a while to turn on.”

“Huh?” Xiao Bao frowned and looked at Chang Feng in confusion. Puzzled, he asked, “Why is it taking so long? Will Mommy be very sad? I want to…”

Before Xiao Bao could finish speaking, the door of the room was pushed open and Mr. Chen walked in.

When Xiao Bao saw Mr. Chen, he placed his phone on the table and quickly ran towards him. He rushed into Mr. Chen’s arms and called out happily, “Daddy!”

Mr. Chen bent down and picked Xiao Bao up high, making him giggle. Then, he hugged Xiao Bao and asked with a smile, “What did you do just now?”

Mr. Chen sat on the sofa and placed Xiao Bao on his lap.

When Xiao Bao heard Mr. Chen’s question, he hurriedly told him about playing games with Qiao Nian just now. In the end, he said, “Daddy, Mommy is really smart. She actually recognized me. I was about to acknowledge Mommy, but my phone ran out of battery.”

At the mention of the phone running out of battery, Xiao Bao lowered his head and sighed helplessly. “How annoying. If only the phone had a full battery all the time. That way, I could acknowledge Mommy.”

Mr. Chen looked at Xiao Bao’s bright smile and the anticipation in his eyes. He nodded. “Yes, what a pity.”

“Daddy, when the phone is charged later, I’ll acknowledge Mommy. Do you think Mommy will think that I’m a lousy gamer?” Xiao Bao had initially thought that he could directly push the blame for his lousy gameplay to Uncle Feng, but now that Mommy already knew that he was the one playing the game, he couldn’t push the blame to Uncle Feng.

Mr. Chen smiled and shook his head. There was a trace of sadness in his eyes as he said, “No, your mommy likes you so much. How could she think that you’re stupid? Moreover, with your mommy playing games with you, you’ll become strong very soon.”

“Yes, Mommy is really amazing.” Xiao Bao explained what had just happened in the game with exultation. He said excitedly, “The people on the other side are bad. They all want to bully Mommy. I’m so brave. I’ve been protecting Mommy!”

There was sadness in Mr. Chen’s eyes, but he still pretended to be calm and said, “I knew Xiao Bao was the best.”

“Yes, Xiao Bao is the best. That’s because Daddy taught him well!” Xiao Bao looked at Mr. Chen happily and wrapped his arms around his neck. “Daddy, after we acknowledge Mommy, can we live together forever and never be separated?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

When Mr. Chen heard Xiao Bao’s words, a lonely smile appeared on his face. He did not answer Xiao Bao directly and asked, “Does Xiao Bao miss Mommy very much?”

Xiao Bao nodded vigorously and said happily, “Of course. Xiao Bao wants to live with Mommy!”

Mr. Chen looked into Xiao Bao’s fox-like eyes and recalled Qiao Nian’s bright face. He sighed helplessly. “Xiao Bao, if only you weren’t a child of the Gu family.”

When Mr. Chen heard Xiao Bao’s innocent words, he couldn’t help but feel bitter.

Xiao Bao continued, “Daddy, I’m a child of the Gu family. That’s why can I be your child. I’m very glad that I’m Daddy’s child. I’m even more glad that I have a father who loves me!”

Xiao Bao hugged Mr. Chen’s body like an adult. He patted Mr. Chen’s side and said softly, “The person Xiao Bao loves the most is Daddy!”

Mr. Chen’s body stiffened slightly, then he hugged Xiao Bao.
