Chapter 647: Winning People OverTranslator: Atlas Studios  Editor: Atlas Studios

If a person was really a fan of Mr. Dong Hua, they would definitely treat Mr. Dong Hua’s album as a treasure, unlike Su Sheng. She was holding Mr. Dong Hua’s album to win people’s hearts.

Qiao Nian didn’t want the beautiful music her second brother had worked so hard to create to become the reason people schemed against each other.

If Su Sheng was willing to lend her the album and she could return it on a later date, she might be even more grateful to Su Sheng.

However, Su Sheng didn’t do that. She wanted to give the album to her. A person would only give something they didn’t want to others.

At that time, she had agreed because she cared about Little Qi’s health.

However, Su Sheng’s blatant flaunting made her feel very uncomfortable.

When she saw Su Sheng previously, she did not tell her that she was here to listen to Mr. Dong Hua’s new song.

Both of them were fans of Mr. Dong Hua.

If one of the fans knew that the other fan could listen to Mr. Dong Hua’s new song in person, they would definitely be envious. Perhaps, they would be disappointed.

It was precisely because of this that she didn’t say it out loud.

Qiao Nian had thought that she would be good friends with Su Sheng, but now it seemed that it was impossible for the two of them to be good friends.

It seemed that Second Brother had invited many people today, but she and Su Sheng had arrived a little earlier.

Qiao Nian heard the voices behind her getting further and further away. If she wasn’t wrong, she and Su Sheng were walking in opposite directions.

It seemed that Second Brother had specially asked her to come here.

Qiao Nian stopped in front of a door. She glanced at the door number, then at the message Lu Nian had sent her.

This was the place.

But why was she the only one around?𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Qiao Nian placed her hand on the glass door and pushed it inward. It didn’t push it open.

A trace of confusion flashed in Qiao Nian’s eyes. She had thought that Second Brother had specially asked her to wait here, but now it seemed that that wasn’t the case. Moreover, Su Sheng was going somewhere else.

Could it be that Second Brother had sent her the wrong location?

Qiao Nian took out her phone and sent Lu Nian a message.

“Brother Nian, I’ve already arrived, but the door is still closed.”

Soon, she received a message from Lu Nian. “There’s a red line under the glass door. If you pull the line out, you can see the key. Take out the key and open the door to wait!”

Qiao Nian turned off her phone and saw a red line under the door. The other end of the line was through the glass door.

Carefully, she pulled the tape out. A silver key appeared in front of her.

Qiao Nian opened the door and walked in, turning on the lights.

The light illuminated the room. It was a music room. There were many instruments around the room. In the middle of the room was a piano.

Qiao Nian looked around. Her gaze inadvertently fell on a door in the corner.

It was a door the color of raw wood. There were still many marks on it.

Some images flashed in Qiao Nian’s mind. She vaguely saw a young lady with her hair in a bun standing in front of the door, letting a handsome young man measure her height.

The young man measured the young lady’s height with his hand. Holding a carving knife, the young lady gently carved a scratch on the door.

She could vaguely see the smile on the young man’s face.

The young lady was having a good time. She started carving on the door again.

Qiao Nian’s frown deepened. She could vaguely hear the young lady calling the young man “Second Brother”.

Suddenly, she came back to her senses and realized that her hand had been placed on the marks.

Her hand gently caressed the marks. In her daze, she seemed to see the young lady carving marks on the door with a carving knife.

Their movements gradually synchronized.

Qiao Nian retracted her hand abruptly, her pupils dilating involuntarily.

Could it be that she had carved these marks when she was young?

Qiao Nian slowly straightened her back. Her gaze fell on the bronze handle, and her eyes gradually darkened.

There seemed to be a voice in Qiao Nian’s heart, clamoring.

“Open it.”

“Open it.”

Qiao Nian’s grip on the door handle tightened.

Something behind the door seemed to be calling her to open it.

Her hands couldn’t stop shaking.
