Chapter 198: Victory

When Qiao Yu heard Qiao Xin’s voice, he frowned slightly, his eyes filled with annoyance and helplessness. “This outcome is better than Mom going to prison for adultery.”

Qiao Xin clenched her fists involuntarily, her nails digging into her palms as she bit her lip. She understood what Qiao Yu meant.

It was all Qiao Nian’s fault! The wretch!

If it weren’t for Qiao Nian, her parents wouldn’t have gotten a divorce. Her perfect family wouldn’t have been torn apart, and her father wouldn’t have been sent to prison for assault!

This was maddening!

…

After Qiao Nian got into the car, she immediately rolled down the window. Only after she saw with her own eyes that Qiao Shan and Su Xue had gotten into the police car under the officer’s instructions, did she relax and roll up the window.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but smile.

Gu Zhou glanced at Qiao Nian. Then, he said to Chen Qing, who was sitting in the driver’s seat, “Let’s go home!”

“Yes, sir.”

The car started slowly. Qiao Nian leaned back in her seat and closed her eyes. Suddenly, she felt a little tired. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Qiao Nian had thought that she would be able to find out her true identity today, but her plans hadn’t kept up with the changes.

She could tell that Su Xue was not lying.

However, she felt that Su Xue was holding back some information. She still had to investigate.

With this thought in mind, Qiao Nian opened her eyes and said to Chen Qing, “Chen Qing, just drop me off at the entrance of the women’s and children’s hospital.”

If she remembered correctly, Su Xue had given birth there.

She wanted to go there and take a look. Perhaps someone there would know about what had happened more than twenty years ago.

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s words, he said, “I’ll go with you.”

“There’s no need. I’ve already wasted a lot of your time today. I’m just going there to take a look around. It’s been more than twenty years. I don’t think we’ll be able to find anything.” Qiao Nian smiled at Gu Zhou.

What had happened today was all thanks to Gu Zhou’s help. If not for him, she might have failed.

She recalled that Gu Zhou hadn’t liked it when she thanked him in the past, so she did not thank him.

Seeing that Qiao Nian had already made up her mind, Gu Zhou didn’t insist.

The car arrived at the entrance of the hospital. Qiao Nian got out of the car and went straight to the director’s office. She knocked on the door.

“Come in.” A low voice came from inside the office.

Qiao Nian pushed the door open and walked in. She saw a middle-aged man in his fifties sitting at the desk.

“Young lady, may I help you?” The director asked kindly.

Qiao Nian said, “I want to leave a blood sample. I want to find my biological parents.”

Qiao Nian was very sure that she had been born in this hospital. Su Xue wasn’t lying either, because she had found a photograph of her when she had just been born. It was said that any child born in a maternity hospital would have a photograph like the one she had.

Moreover, her biological parents had never looked for her. Perhaps her biological parents had already left a blood sample in the hospital. However, she did not leave a blood sample of her own, so her biological parents could not find her.

And no one else knew if her biological parents had looked for her.

“Alright, I’ll write out a form for you. You can leave a blood sample.” The director smiled at Qiao Nian.

“Thank you, Director.” Qiao Nian smiled at the director. Her eyes flashed, and she continued, “Director, all these years, has anyone who lost their child come to the hospital to look for them?”

The director had stood up, and was rummaging through the bookcase for the forms. When he heard Qiao Nian’s question, he replied, “Of course. Many parents come here to look for their children. Some people abandoned their children in the hospital because they couldn’t afford to raise them back then. Later on, when their finances improved, they came to look for their children. After all, no parent would let their own child wander around on the streets.”

Qiao Nian had a strange feeling. She pursed her red lips and asked with concern, “Did any of them find their child?”

“Some parents have found their children, but some haven’t. However, there are many blood samples in our database. I hope you can find your parents.” The director sat at his desk and wrote out a form for a blood sample.
