730 Not an Outsider

Song Yu stood rooted to the ground in a daze. It took her a while to realize what Third Brother was talking about.

It seemed that Third Brother really hated Jiang Yue. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The things in Song Yu’s room were actually not what she liked. Someone had helped her choose them.

She had a house near the filming venue that belonged to her. The decorations in that house were all her favorites.

With this thought in mind, Song Yu said to the servant, “Throw out everything in the room. Replace all the items.”

Lu Rao walked back. Not long after, he bumped into Lu Zhu.

Seeing that Lu Rao was the only one who had returned, Lu Zhu asked in confusion, “Where are Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian?”

“They’ve already left.”

When Lu Zhu heard Lu Rao’s words, he frowned slightly and asked, “Why did they leave so quickly?”

“Brother, have you forgotten that in the afternoon, Grandma will invite monks to pray for Sugar? At that time, Grandma won’t allow outsiders to stay,” Lu Rao said calmly. A trace of confusion flashed in his eyes as he looked at Lu Zhu curiously.

Lu Zhu shook his head gently and said, “Of course I haven’t forgotten.”

“Then why are you asking me why I didn’t let them stay? Although we’re on good terms with the Gu family, Grandma Gu didn’t come this time. Coupled with what Jiang Yue did just now, Grandma definitely won’t let them stay.”

“But Nian Nian isn’t an outsider,” Lu Zhu said with a frown.

When Lu Rao heard Lu Zhu’s words, he was slightly stunned.

Today, he realized that his eldest brother’s attitude towards Qiao Nian was a little strange. Moreover, during lunch, Second Brother had even picked up food for Qiao Nian.

Lu Rao’s frown deepened. He didn’t understand why his eldest and second brothers’ attitudes towards Qiao Nian had changed so much. He asked, “Brother, what are you hiding from me?”

When Lu Zhu heard Lu Rao’s words, he sighed softly.

He stared unblinkingly at Lu Rao. Even if he told Lu Rao the truth now, Lu Rao might not believe him.

One had to know that Lu Rao did not believe anything unless he saw concrete evidence.

Lu Rao kept staring at Lu Zhu. Seeing Lu Zhu’s silent expression, an idea suddenly flashed across his mind.

He felt that Big Brother and Second Brother must be hiding something very important from him.

Could it be related to Qiao Nian?

“Brother, if you’re unwilling to tell me, I’ll investigate it myself,” Lu Rao said tentatively.

Lu Zhu’s gaze landed on Lu Rao’s face. Lu Rao was a little stubborn. No matter what, he had to get to the bottom of it.

If Lu Rao found out, those people might be alerted.

At the thought of this, Lu Zhu looked at Lu Rao seriously and said, “What I’m about to say is true. Don’t doubt me.”

When Lu Rao heard Lu Zhu’s words, he did not nod immediately. Instead, he frowned at Lu Zhu.

He felt that this matter was very serious.

“I believe you!” Lu Rao nodded.

Lu Zhu glanced around. There were many servants around. He frowned slightly. Although he believed that the servants of the Lu family were very loyal, for Sugar’s safety, he said, “Come to the study with me.”

“Yeah.”

Lu Zhu and Lu Rao walked towards the study.

At this moment, a woman walked out of the corner of the corridor. It was none other than Song Yu.

Song Yu had wanted to look for Second Brother, but she accidentally overheard the conversation between her eldest brother and third brother. She watched as the two of them hurriedly left and fell into deep thought.

She had thought that Big Brother had come here just to ask them to go to the Buddhist hall to pray for her sister. She had never expected that Big Brother wanted Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian to stay.

What puzzled Song Yu the most was why her brother had said that Qiao Nian wasn’t an outsider.

Qiao Nian couldn’t be family, right?

She had a feeling that what Lu Zhu and Lu Rao said was very likely related to Qiao Nian.

Could it be that Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou were already engaged?

The Gu and Lu families were on good terms. Previously, Grandma Gu often stayed behind to pray for her sister.
