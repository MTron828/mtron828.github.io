1372 I’m Sorry

When she stabilized her emotions again, she continued to wipe Qin Chuan’s face. Her hand trembled and she accidentally touched the wound on Qin Chuan’s forehead.

Lu Qi’s tears fell one by one. She apologized tearfully, “Senior Brother, I’m sorry. I’m really sorry. Does it hurt?”

“Qi Qi.”

“Huh?” Lu Qi looked at Qin Chuan with teary eyes. At the thought that Qin Chuan was still pressed down by a rock, her tears fell again.

“Don’t cry, be good.”

Lu Qi’s pupils dilated slightly as she looked at Qin Chuan in disbelief.

He was clearly the one suffering now, but he still wanted to comfort her.

However, Qin Chuan’s words were like the winter sun. They were warm, making her no longer afraid of the cold.

Lu Qi looked at Qin Chuan in front of her with heartache. She raised her hand to wipe her tears and said in a low voice, “Senior, I’m fine.”

Lu Qi carefully wiped Qin Chuan’s face clean. She looked at Qin Chuan’s handsome face, and her heart began to race for some reason.

Her brothers were all very handsome. Perhaps it was because she often saw handsome brothers, but every time she heard her classmates say which celebrity was handsome, she didn’t feel anything.

Qin Chuan’s face was sickly pale. Even so, it couldn’t hide his peerless beauty.

He had a pair of peach blossom eyes that were filled with gentleness, making one involuntarily immerse themselves in them.

Lu Qi’s face was slightly red. She looked down to the side. The only source of light in the car was her phone. She wanted to talk to Qin Chuan more so that he wouldn’t fall asleep.

However, Qin Chuan’s breathing was very heavy and he looked very weak. He couldn’t chat with her at all.

Lu Qi glanced at the battery on her phone and could only adjust it to save battery. Under the weak light of the screen, she said, “Senior Brother, stop talking. You can’t sleep anymore. Let’s conserve our strength. When the search and rescue team arrives, we’ll be saved.”

Lu Qi glanced at her cell phone and sighed. “What a pity that there’s no signal on the phone. Otherwise, I could have made a call.”

Qin Chuan lowered his gaze, his long eyelashes trembling slightly. “The other party’s target should be us.”

When Lu Qi heard Qin Chuan’s words, her eyes widened. She asked in fear, “Then what should we do now?”

With that, Lu Qi looked at the roof and asked, “Senior Brother, is there anything in your car that can help us support the roof?”

“No.” Qin Chuan had brought bedding, his clothes, and Lu Qi’s clothes in the car. He thought that if he spent the night in the village, there would be a clean bed to sleep on.

Lu Qi placed her phone on the car seat and tried to lift the roof again, but her strength was too limited.

“Save your strength. I’ll think of a way so that we can save ourselves,” Qin Chuan said in a low voice, looking at Lu Qi.

Just as Lu Qi was about to speak, she recalled that Qin Chuan was very smart. He must have thought of another way, so she stopped talking.

Qin Chuan looked at Lu Qi, who was sitting there with her head lowered. Her body was still trembling. He asked worriedly, “Are you injured? Cough, cough…”

When Lu Qi heard Qin Chuan’s words, she hurriedly shook her head and said, “Senior Brother, don’t worry about me. I’m really fine. I was well protected by you. My hand was just cut a little by the glass. I’m fine.”

Lu Qi stared unblinkingly at Qin Chuan and his dry lips. She asked in a low voice, “Senior Brother, your lips are a little dry. Do you want some water?”

Without waiting for Qin Chuan to speak, she brought the mineral water over, opened it, and handed it to him.

Qin Chuan was lying in the front passenger seat. At this angle, there was no way to drink water.

Qin Chuan saw Lu Qi pour the mineral water into the bottle cap and hand it to him.

He lowered his head slightly and was about to drink some water when Lu Qi’s hand trembled and the bottle cap fell off.

Lu Qi looked at the wet bottle of water on the front passenger seat and frowned, her heart filled with regret.

Why couldn’t she do such a simple thing?

Lu Qi looked up at Qin Chuan’s dry lips and felt extremely sad. There was only a bottle of water in the car.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m
