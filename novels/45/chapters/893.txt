894 Reunion

Later on, she found out that it wasn’t that Gu Zhou didn’t care about Gu Qi during that period of time, but that he couldn’t care less about Gu Qi at all because he was unconscious when he fell ill.

Hence, she could understand Gu Zhou’s helplessness back then.

After Gu Zhou woke up and he interacted with Gu Qi, Gu Zhou had always treated Gu Qi well in his own way.

When Gu Zhou understood Gu Qi’s true needs, he quickly won Gu Qi’s trust again.

!!

The current Gu Zhou had already become a good father.

He said it all with his own practical actions. He was a safe haven for children, and an example for them.

At this moment, Qiao Nian sensed that Gu Zhou had been looking at her. She looked at him in confusion.

When Gu Zhou met Qiao Nian’s gaze, a gentle smile appeared on his face.

He picked up a child in each hand and stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian, his eyes burning.

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned, but she quickly reacted. She walked up to Gu Zhou and reached out to hug him and the two children.

The coldness around them instantly disappeared, leaving only warmth.

Qiao Nian was slightly stunned. This feeling was the same as when she had hugged Lu Zhu back then. This was the warmth in a family.

“Mommy!” Seeing Qiao Nian hug him, Gu Qi struggled to turn around and wrap his arms around Qiao Nian’s neck.

Qiao Nian hurriedly hugged Gu Qi, worried that he would fall.

Gu Zhou’s free hand wrapped around Qiao Nian’s waist.

Qiao Nian slowly lowered her gaze, her lips curving up slightly as she enjoyed the warmth.

At this moment, Matriarch Gu walked out of the house wearing a European-style retro dress. She was dressed like a character from a fairy tale.

When Qiao Nian heard footsteps, she turned her head. Seeing Matriarch Gu approach, she called out, “Grandma!”

Gu Qi and Xiao Shi got out of Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou’s arms and ran to Matriarch Gu with their short legs. The two children hugged Matriarch Gu.

“Great-grandmother!”

“Great-grandmother!”

When Matriarch Gu heard the childish voices of the two children, her eyes instantly turned red. She nodded and said in a choked voice, “Alright, alright. You’re both great-grandmother’s good children. Since you’re already back, our family will live together forever!”

Gu Qi and Xiao Shi nodded.

Actually, on the way back, Xiao Shi still felt terrible.

Today, she had personally seen her mommy, who had raised her for five years, jump down from the hospital window.

During the day, she even had a nightmare.

But now, all of that had changed.

When she stepped into the Gu family villa, the sadness in her heart was completely dispelled by the warmth of her family. All that was left was happiness.

She had never dared to imagine such a happy life in the past.

Gu Zhou watched as the two children hugged Matriarch Gu. He reached out and wrapped his arm around Qiao Nian’s waist, looking at her with a burning gaze.

Qiao Nian couldn’t help but blush when she met Gu Zhou’s gaze. She pursed her lips and hurriedly changed the topic. In a low voice, she said, “Xiao Shi is very happy!”

“If it weren’t for you, I wouldn’t have been able to do all this!” Gu Zhou said sincerely.

If Qiao Nian hadn’t enlightened Xiao Shi, she might still be stuck in a dead end and wouldn’t be able to come out for a while.

Just as Qiao Nian was about to say something, her phone suddenly rang. She subconsciously pushed Gu Zhou’s hand away and turned her back to him. Only then did she take out her phone to look.

Gu Zhou looked at his hand, which was holding Qiao Nian’s. His hand was still awkwardly in midair. He looked at Qiao Nian’s back and couldn’t help but laugh again.

He believed that he would definitely be honest with Qiao Nian in the future. There was no need to avoid each other.

Gu Zhou retracted his gaze from Qiao Nian and looked at the two children again.

Qiao Nian turned on her phone. When she saw the message, the smile on her face instantly disappeared, and her expression turned serious.

“After we cracked Song Man’s phone, we realized that her last call was to Qiao Xin.”

Qiao Nian’s beautiful fox-like eyes were cold.
