1354 Just a Classmate

Qiao Nian couldn’t react for a moment. She smiled helplessly and said, “I’m teaching you how to get along with friends.”

Xiao Shi blinked in confusion and said innocently, “Can Li Tian be my Second Sister-in-law?”

Xiao Bao, who was sitting in the back row, couldn’t help but say, “Sister, we’re just classmates. You’re thinking too much.”

Xiao Shi looked at Xiao Bao in confusion. “Second Brother, if you don’t like Li Tian, why did you accept her snacks?”

Qiao Nian instantly sweated. She looked at Xiao Shi beside her and explained gently, “Xiao Shi, if a boy treats Xiao Bao to a meal, will Xiao Bao be with a boy too?”

Xiao Shi blinked, her big black grape-like eyes filled with confusion.

“It’s called being cordial and hospitable when classmates give each other food. Good friends share food with each other. It doesn’t mean that they want to marry someone else. Marriage is a big deal.” As Qiao Nian spoke, the car arrived at the Gu family villa. She stopped the car, unbuckled her seatbelt, and smiled at Xiao Shi. “Also, if you really call Li Tian Second Sister-in-law, won’t you be taking advantage of her? Her parents will be angry.”

In a daze, Xiao Shi followed Qiao Nian out of the car. Gu Qi and Xiao Bao also got out of the car and everyone walked in.

When she walked to the living room, Qiao Nian instructed the three of them to do their homework well. She asked them to go upstairs to do their homework, then turned around and went to the medicinal room.

Xiao Shi had originally followed Gu Qi and Xiao Bao upstairs. After taking a few steps, her mind was still filled with confusion. She said to Gu Qi and Xiao Bao, “Brother and Second Brother, there’s something I don’t understand. I want to consult Mommy. Go upstairs and do your homework first!”

With that, Xiao Shi carried her small school bag and quickly walked downstairs. Seeing Qiao Nian walk into the medicinal room, she followed her in.

Just as Qiao Nian was about to close the door, she saw Xiao Shi following her in. Smiling, she asked, “Xiao Shi, why aren’t you doing your homework with your brothers?”

Xiao Shi looked up at Qiao Nian and asked in confusion, “Mommy, I still don’t understand.”

“What don’t you understand?” Qiao Nian called Xiao Shi in and closed the door.

She walked to the chair in front of the experiment table and sat down. She carried Xiao Shi on her lap and took her school bag down to place it on the experiment table.

“Mommy, in the past, I used to hear from others that if a boy gave a gift to a girl or a girl gave a boy a gift, it meant that they had to be together.” Xiao Shi blinked, her eyes filled with hesitation. “Brother and I only had snacks to eat because of Second Brother.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Qiao Nian was instantly on guard. If a boy bought snacks for Xiao Shi, wouldn’t Xiao Shi be snatched away by that young brat?

Xiao Shi lowered her head slightly and pouted. “Auntie Song told me that previously. She even said that others helped us because they wanted to take advantage of us. Uncle Wang, who’s next door, wanted to help Auntie Song repair the door, but Auntie Song was unwilling. She even said that Uncle Wang wanted to woo her and asked me not to talk to men. If a girl is good to me, she might want to take away my beauty.”

Qiao Nian frowned imperceptibly. She really didn’t understand why Song Man would say such strange things in front of Xiao Shi.

Xiao Shi recalled the past, and her eyes darkened. She said, “In the past, I had to spend money to borrow things from others. Auntie Song said that this way, I wouldn’t have to take advantage of others, let alone worry about my beauty being taken away.”

Qiao Nian hugged Xiao Shi tightly and gently kissed her forehead. She said gently, “Xiao Shi, it’s not what you think. Your looks are natural. From the moment you were born, it was already decided. It’s impossible for anyone to take away your beauty. Sometimes, when you are interacting with others, it’s not about the money. For example, since Li Tian bought snacks for you, you could buy pastries for her tomorrow. Good friends won’t be so calculative with each other.”

“Does she really not like Second Brother?” Xiao Shi asked in disappointment. “I think she’s very good-looking. When she smiles, she’s especially adorable. I hope she can be my Second Sister-in-law.”
