1400 Unbelievable

Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou’s voices weren’t soft, and they woke the rest of the family up.

After a while, the other members of the Lu family came down from the second floor one after another. Seeing that they were all standing at the kitchen door, they frowned slightly. “Why aren’t you asleep?”

Uncle Zhao lowered his head and clenched his fists tightly.

Seeing that Qiao Nian was also here, Matriarch Lu walked over to her step by step and asked gently, “Nian Nian, why are you back so late? Since you’re back, go back to your room and rest early.”

Qiao Nian nodded slightly and looked at Matriarch Lu.

Su Yan was the last to come down. She was wearing a purple satin sleeping robe. As she walked, she coughed and asked, “Sugar, how is Qi Qi now?”

“She’s fine now.”

When Su Yan heard Qiao Nian’s words, she heaved a sigh of relief and began coughing again.

Matriarch Lu looked at Su Yan, who was coughing so hard that her face was red. She hurriedly said, “I’ve already told you. You should rest early.”

“Mom, I’m fine.” Su Yan shook her head gently.

When Uncle Zhao heard that Lu Qi was fine, he frowned slightly and sneered. “I didn’t expect the precious daughter of the Lu family to be so lucky!”

Uncle Zhao’s words stunned Matriarch Lu, Su Yan, Lu Zhu, and Lu Nian.

When Auntie Cao heard Uncle Zhao’s words, her face turned pale with fear. She quickly stepped forward and grabbed Uncle Zhao’s arm. She said coldly, “What nonsense are you spouting? Hurry up and apologize.”

“Did I say anything wrong?” Uncle Zhao raised his hand and shook Auntie Cao off. He looked at Matriarch Lu expressionlessly and asked coldly, “Matriarch, do you know why Master invited my wife and children to the New Year’s Eve banquet back then?”

Matriarch Lu felt a chill run down her spine. She had a bad feeling and shook her head gently.

“That’s because my wife is pregnant with your Lu family’s child!” At this point, a despairing smile appeared on Uncle Zhao’s face. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“When I was young, I took a bullet for Master and built a business empire for him. When Master retired, I helped him take care of his family, but I found out that my wife had long been tainted by Master. My child was also Master’s. Master was afraid that I would find out about these things, so he deliberately got someone to kill my wife and child.”

The more Uncle Zhao spoke, the more uncomfortable he felt. Tears fell one by one. “I’ve worked so hard for the Lu family. How did the Lu family repay me?”

Matriarch Lu frowned and asked in confusion, “What nonsense are you spouting?”

“I’m spouting nonsense? You’re so pitiful. You don’t even know the truth of the matter. Your man doesn’t love you at all. He’s been with my wife for a long time.” The more Uncle Zhao thought about it, the more hatred he felt. He gritted his teeth and said, “That poor wife of mine doesn’t know anything. She was tainted by that old man just like that.”

Although Matriarch Lu was old, she was not muddle-headed. She narrowed her eyes and asked directly, “Did you tell those people about Qi Qi’s schedule on purpose?”

“So what if it’s me? I’m just taking revenge for my wife who didn’t dare to resist!” Uncle Zhao’s eyes were filled with hatred, and his lips were trembling. “I’ve lost my family. I want you to experience the pain of losing your family!”

Matriarch Lu was so angry that she clutched her chest and breathed heavily.

Qiao Nian hurriedly helped Matriarch Lu up and gently stroked her back, comforting her. “Grandma, don’t be anxious. Breathe slowly!”

Matriarch Lu pointed at Uncle Zhao’s face and said angrily, “You… you’re spouting nonsense!”

“I’m spouting nonsense. You’re a housewife. You’ve been at home for too long. You really don’t know anything.” Uncle Zhao’s voice trembled. The more he thought about it, the sadder he became. What had his wife done wrong?

Just because his wife was good-looking and filial to his mother, Old Master Lu actually targeted her.

Matriarch Lu breathed heavily. When she finally calmed down, she questioned angrily, “You’ve been following Master everywhere. How can you not know where he goes? If he really did such a thing, why did you stay in the Lu family for so long? You even let Lu Qi ride on your neck to play. You’re really good at acting.”

When Uncle Zhao heard Matriarch Lu’s words, a trace of confusion flashed in his eyes. He blinked, and the image of him driving away alone after sending Old Master Lu back to the Lu family villa flashed in his mind.
