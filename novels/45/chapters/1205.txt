1206 Questioning

Gu Zhou and Qiao Nian walked in side by side and sat opposite Mr. Chen.

Lu Jiang walked in with a box, then gestured for Allen to close the door.

The atmosphere in the room became a little heavy. Lu Jiang walked to the coffee table and placed the box in his hand in front of Mr. Chen. He said gently, “Mr. Chen, this is a gift specially prepared for you.”

Mr. Chen glanced at everyone in the room, his gaze finally landing on the box on the coffee table. His thin lips curved up slightly as he looked around lazily and slowly took out a cigarette from his pocket.

Holding the cigarette between his right index and middle fingers, he flicked it casually before putting it to his mouth and lighting it.

Gu Zhou sat opposite Mr. Chen. He watched as Mr. Chen took out a cigarette, flicked it, and lit it. In a daze, his thoughts returned to many years ago.

When he was young, Gu Yue also liked to sit lazily on the sofa and smoke. Gu Yue’s smoking movements were exactly the same as Mr. Chen’s.

A trace of confusion flashed in Gu Zhou’s eyes.

Why was Mr. Chen smoking exactly the same way as Big Brother?

Could it just be a coincidence?

Mr. Chen took a puff of his cigarette and held it in his right hand. He raised his eyebrows slightly and asked, “You didn’t spend so much effort to invite me over just to give me a gift, right? If you have anything to say, just say it!”

When Jiang Chi heard Mr. Chen’s voice, he narrowed his eyes slightly.

Mr. Chen’s voice was not at all like Gu Yue’s, but looking at Mr. Chen’s eyes and his smoking just now, he felt as if Gu Yue was sitting in front of him.

Gu Yue was ten years younger than Mr. Chen. How could they be the same person?

However, Jiang Chi did not have time to think too much about it now. To him, Jiang Cheng’s matter was more important. He asked, “Mr. Chen, my brother’s name is Jiang Cheng. Do you remember him?”

Mr. Chen blew out a smoke ring, which gradually grew larger. He nodded and said without hiding anything, “I know him. He’s a medical genius.”

When Jiang Chi heard Mr. Chen’s words, his heart jumped to his throat, and his palms were covered in sweat. He pursed his lips and suppressed the excitement in his heart. Trying hard to remain calm, he asked, “Mr. Chen, my brother… he made his last call to you when he was alive. I want to know why he wanted to see you.”

Mr. Chen’s hand, which was holding a cigarette, trembled slightly. His pupils constricted, but he quickly regained his composure and looked up at Jiang Chi.

“Who said that?”

Jiang Chi frowned slightly and said in a low voice, “That’s what I found.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Medicine?

Jiang Chi instantly became nervous and asked impatiently, “What medicine did he ask you for?”

Mr. Chen’s gaze sized up Jiang Chi, and a trace of helplessness flashed in his eyes. “You should know that you have one of his kidneys in your body. People who are missing one kidney will buy medicine that increases their immunity. Although that medicine has been safely verified in MY, it hasn’t been verified worldwide. I have supply.”

Mr. Chen paused for a moment and continued, “I told him that if he took too much of this medicine, his body might be immune to it, but he insisted on taking it every month.”

When Jiang Chi heard Mr. Chen’s words, his eyes turned red. He turned to the side and tried hard to remain calm.

So his brother had suffered so much for him, but he had never known.

“A month before his accident, he said that he was going to An City. I prepared medicine for him. Later, he called me by video call in An City and wanted me to send him medicine. I saw that he didn’t look well, so I asked a few more questions.”

Mr. Chen’s words instantly attracted the attention of the others. They stared unblinkingly at him.

“Who was he going to see?” Jiang Chi asked eagerly.

Mr. Chen took a drag on his cigarette and blew out smoke, as if he was sad for the dead and injured Jiang Cheng. Only then did he say, “He didn’t say. He hung up. The next day, when I was about to send him medicine, I saw his death on the news.”
