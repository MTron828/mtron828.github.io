Chapter 89: Wasn’t She Poisoned?

Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

With a cold expression, Jiang Yue frowned at Qiao Nian and said, “Second Sister-in-law, you’re directly involved in this matter. I’m afraid it wouldn’t be appropriate for you to take Grandma’s pulse. After all, you might be biased.”

The butler’s face turned pale. His brow furrowed deeper and deeper. Second Young Master had left the house on an errand. Without Second Young Master around, he did not know what to do regarding this matter.

Jiang Yue pushed Qiao Nian aside and reached out to touch Matriarch Gu’s forehead. She said anxiously, “Grandma’s forehead is so hot. She’s having a fever. If it continues, what will we do?”

Qiao Nian looked at Jiang Yue impassively, a slight frown on her face. “Miss Jiang, what are you doing?”

Jiang Yue looked at Qiao Nian in confusion. Puzzled, she asked, “Second Sister-in-law, what are you talking about?”

“You know very well what you’ve done.” Qiao Nian stood calmly to the side.

At this moment, Doctor Su arrived.

He was a private doctor of the Gu family, and also Matriarch Gu’s attending physician.

Jiang Yue quickly stood to the side and gave Doctor Su some space. Pretending to be worried, she said, “Doctor Su, please help to take a look at Grandma. What’s happened to Grandma?”

Zhao Qian had wanted to ask Doctor Su as well, but since Jiang Yue had spoken, she stood silently to the side.

She studied medicine. Actually, she also had the ability to treat and diagnose Matriarch Gu, but her mind was in a mess right now and she could not get in the right frame of mind to treat her grandmother’s illness.

Doctor Su examined Matriarch Gu’s body carefully. After a while, he frowned and said, “Matriarch Gu has caught a cold. She’s quite physically weak, which is why she vomited blood and has a high fever.”

“Wasn’t she poisoned?” Jiang Yue blurted out.

‘When Qiao Nian and Zhao Qian heard Jiang Yue’s words, they both frowned.

“She’s not poisoned,” Doctor Su said seriously.

Jiang Yue’s face turned bright red. She turned to look at Qiao Nian and said awkwardly, “I-I’m sorry, Second Sister-in-law. I-I misunderstood you.”

Zhao Qian frowned as she looked at Jiang Yue. Grandma had also told Jiang Yue about the will. She felt that Jiang Yue’s actions today were very suspicious.

The butler, who was standing at the side, heaved a sigh of relief. If Second Young Madam was really the culprit, then they would be in big trouble.

“How about this? I’ll prescribe some medicine to treat her cold. She’ll be fine after taking it,” Doctor Su said. Then, he began to write down the prescription.

“Can I take a look at the prescription?” Qiao Nian walked up to Doctor Su and asked.

“Sure.” Doctor Su handed the prescription to Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian took a closer look and saw that the ingredients prescribed would not come into conflict with her prescription. She was about to pass it to the butler when she suddenly froze.

“Doctor Su, does Grandma have asthma?” Qiao Nian looked up at Doctor Su.

Doctor Su nodded and said, “Yes. Her asthma isn’t serious. She just needs to take note of it.”

Qiao Nian felt a lingering fear. Fortunately, the medicine she had prescribed for Grandma could also be taken by patients with asthma. She handed the prescription to the butler.

“Butler, call Second Young Master and ask him to return immediately.” Qiao Nian had a feeling that things weren’t as simple as they seemed. Why would Jiang Yue frame her?

“Alright,” the butler answered before leaving.

Qiao Nian frowned. Her eyelid wouldn’t stop twitching. For some reason, she felt her heart beating faster and faster. She had a vague notion that something very bad was happening.

She looked up at Jiang Yue, who was staring unblinkingly at Matriarch Gu. Her expression was blank.

She turned to look at Matriarch Gu. Her gaze finally landed on the blood at Matriarch Gu’s mouth. She found the sight frightening.

Half an hour later, the butler returned with the medicine.

Qiao Nian was about to pick up the medicine when she was pushed aside by Jiang Yue.

Zhao Qian hurriedly steadied Qiao Nian and looked at her worriedly. “Second Sister-in-law, are you alright?” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Tm fine, thank you.” Qiao Nian thanked her casually, her gaze fixed on Matriarch Gu..
