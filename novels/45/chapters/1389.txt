Qin Chuan’s gaze stopped on Song Yu’s face. He felt a memory flash across his mind, but he couldn’t catch it.

Qin Chuan frowned slightly, trying hard to recall the scene that had just flashed across his mind.

Seeing that Qin Chuan was frowning, Song Yu thought that he had just woken up and was still thinking about what had happened previously. She didn’t speak and sat there quietly, unable to interrupt him. She lowered her head and sent Qiao Nian a message, wanting to tell her that Qin Chuan had already woken up.

However, before she could finish typing her text, she was interrupted by Qin Chuan.

“Who am I?”

The cell phone in Song Yu’s hand slid down. She looked at Qin Chuan in disbelief and only saw confusion in his eyes. She thought for a while and replied seriously, “You’re Qin Chuan, Mr. Qin. Can’t you remember anything?”

Qin Chuan frowned slightly and muttered softly, “Qin Chuan…”

Although he no longer had any memories, these two words were especially familiar to him. Perhaps his name was really Qin Chuan. What did he do in the past?

Realizing this, Qin Chuan’s head instantly hurt. He closed his eyes and frowned.

“Mr. Qin, how are you? Are you feeling unwell?” Song Yu looked at Qin Chuan’s pained expression and noticed that his forehead was covered in cold sweat. She said anxiously, “Wait a moment. I’ll call the doctor over.”

As Song Yu spoke, she pressed the emergency button by the bed and called Qiao Nian.

Qiao Nian had just placed Lu Qi on the bed to sleep and was about to return to visit Qin Chuan when her phone suddenly rang. She took it out and saw that it was Song Yu calling.

“Hello?”

“Sister, Mr. Qin has woken up, but there’s something wrong with his condition. He seems to have lost his memory. He doesn’t seem to be feeling well now. I’ve already called the doctor.”

Song Yu’s anxious voice came from the cell phone.

“I’ll go over now!” Qiao Nian frowned slightly, as if she had thought of something. She quickly walked towards Qin Chuan’s ward.

Qin Chuan’s ward was not far from Lu Qi’s. As soon as Qiao Nian entered, she saw Qin Chuan in pain.

“Where does it hurt?” Qiao Nian walked to Qin Chuan’s bed and sat down on a chair. She picked up Qin Chuan’s hand and began to take his pulse.

When Qin Chuan heard Qiao Nian’s voice again, he no longer dwelled on those fragments. He stared unblinkingly at Qiao Nian.

For some reason, he felt a sense of kinship with her, as if they had known each other for a long time.

Seeing that Qin Chuan had calmed down, Qiao Nian didn’t speak.

His pulse had returned to normal, but he was a little weak.

She had just heard from Song Yu’s words that Qin Chuan seemed to have lost his memory. She looked at Qin Chuan, who was looking at her with a strange expression.

Qiao Nian’s heart gradually sank to the bottom. Frowning, she asked, “Old Qin, is your brain really damaged?”

“Old Qin…” Qin Chuan lay on the bed, a trace of confusion flashing in his eyes. He enunciated each word clearly. “Am I very old?”

Qiao Nian looked at Qin Chuan in disbelief. No matter how she looked at it, Qin Chuan looked in a daze.

Qin Chuan’s gaze lingered on Qiao Nian’s face as he asked, “Don’t you know me? Am I really getting old?”

“No.” Qiao Nian shook her head gently and said, “You’re still very young. You’re my senior brother. My name is Qiao Nian.”

“Qiao Nian…” Qin Chuan felt that she wasn’t lying, because he also felt an inexplicable sense of familiarity with this name.

“Since I’m your senior, shouldn’t you call me senior?” Qin Chuan frowned and asked seriously.

Qiao Nian was speechless.

Qin Chuan made sense. She was actually speechless.

Qin Chuan thought that Qiao Nian was embarrassed by his words. He changed the topic and said, “Where’s Master?”

Since Qiao Nian, his junior sister, had come to take care of him, why wasn’t his master around?

“He… he’s missing.” At the thought that her grandfather’s whereabouts were unknown, Qiao Nian felt terrible.

“Missing? Then why didn’t you look for him?” Qin Chuan looked at Qiao Nian in confusion and asked in a low voice.
