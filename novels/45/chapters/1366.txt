1367 Fear

This collapse was even more serious than the news had said. It looked like an ancient mass grave.

Qiao Nian’s eyes turned red again. She pushed Gu Zhou away and walked towards the Wang Village tunnel. Her footsteps quickened, and she was about to run.

Seeing that Qiao Nian was like a soulless person, Gu Zhou walked forward in a daze. He hurriedly grabbed Qiao Nian’s arm and called out, “Nian’er.”

Qiao Nian was like a walking corpse. She couldn’t sense her surroundings. She wanted to walk forward, but she was pulled back.

She looked at the owner of the hand holding her arm and saw the man saying something to her anxiously, but she couldn’t hear anything.

Gu Zhou pulled Qiao Nian into his arms and rested his chin gently on the top of her head. He said softly, “Don’t worry, it’ll be fine. Chen Qing has already brought people in to look for them. Don’t be anxious. This kind of thing can only be solved slowly.”

Seeing no reaction from Qiao Nian, Gu Zhou kissed her forehead with heartache and pulled her tightly into his arms.

Qiao Nian’s world was white. She couldn’t see her surroundings clearly. This was a world without any sound. It was frighteningly quiet.

She didn’t know how long she had been walking for. Suddenly, she heard the strong beating of her heart. She suddenly came back to her senses and noticed that she was being carried by Gu Zhou. Only then did she realize that the heartbeat she had just heard was Gu Zhou’s.

Qiao Nian hugged Gu Zhou back and asked in a trembling voice, “Ah Zhou, nothing will happen to them, right?”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s voice, he let go of her and looked down at her. He nodded seriously and said, “Yes, they’ll be fine. Don’t worry.”

Qiao Nian met Gu Zhou’s dark eyes, and her uneasy heart calmed down slightly. She said, “I want to go over and help.”

Before Gu Zhou could speak, a voice came from afar.

“Sugar!”

“Sister Nian!”

Qiao Nian’s pupils dilated slightly. Her eldest brother had always called her Sugar. The only person who called her Sister Nian was Second Brother Lu Nian.

Qiao Nian turned around and saw Lu Zhu and Lu Nian walking over with serious expressions, their eyes filled with anxiety.

When Qiao Nian saw them, she thought of Lu Qi, who was pressed down by rocks. Her eyes couldn’t help but turn red, and her voice choked. “Eldest Brother, Second Brother, do you already know?”

When Lu Nian heard Qiao Nian’s words, his expression turned even more serious. He frowned. “When she came out today, she said that she was going to the spirit village. Later on, news of the collapse of the tunnel in Wang Village spread like wildfire. When we investigated, we realized that she might have passed by here, so we called her, but no one picked up Qi Qi’s call.”

Lu Zhu’s expression was serious. He looked down at his cell phone and said, “I checked Qin Chuan’s car plate number.”

As soon as he said this, Gu Zhou, Qiao Nian, and Lu Nian’s gazes fell on Lu Zhu’s face.

Lu Zhu pursed his lips tightly. “Qin Chuan’s car didn’t drive out of the tunnel.”

Qiao Nian’s body swayed slightly. If Gu Zhou hadn’t been supporting her, she might have fallen to the ground. She looked up at Lu Zhu, her voice weak and trembling. “Then Sister and Qin Chuan…”

“Nothing will happen,” Lu Zhu said firmly.

Lu Zhu’s words were not only encouraging Qiao Nian to believe that Lu Qi was fine, but also encouraging himself to believe that Lu Qi was still alive.

Qiao Nian nodded slightly. With Lu Zhu and Lu Nian here, she felt much better.

Lu Nian frowned slightly and said, “Now, let’s go see if there’s a crack in the tunnel and check if there’s a car under the crack. If there’s a car, we can remind the rescue team to go and save them.”

Qiao Nian nodded in agreement. She had thought so too. She didn’t know when they would be saved if she relied on the rescue team to start from scratch.

Qiao Nian and Gu Zhou were together. She stepped on the dry grass and listened to the creaking sounds, her frown deepening.

“The speed of the car in the tunnel can’t exceed 40 kilometers per hour. Ten minutes after Qin Chuan’s car entered the tunnel, the tunnel began to collapse, which means that he was about six to seven kilometers from the entrance of the tunnel,” Gu Zhou said solemnly, looking at the data Chen Qing had sent.
