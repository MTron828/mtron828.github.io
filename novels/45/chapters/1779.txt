Chapter 1780 Sleeping Together

When the wedding starts tomorrow, there would definitely be some people who would not be able to go for some reason.

Chang Feng and Qiao Nian hacked into the hotel's system together and blocked all the cameras. They even retrieved the surveillance cameras from a few days ago to replace tonight's recording.

Lina sat beside Qiao Nian and watched as Qiao Nian's fingers danced quickly on the keyboard. When Qiao Nian stopped what she was doing and knew that she had already settled her matters, she asked curiously, "Nian Nian, how did you and Mr. Gu fall in love in the beginning?"

Qiao Nian moved her shoulders slightly. Hearing Lina's question, she couldn't help but laugh. "Actually, my story with him is a little complicated. We first had children, then were forced to get married. Then, our children were kidnapped. Later, we lived together. It was all for the children!"

Lina was so frightened that her eyes widened. She said in disbelief, "Is that so? But, but Mr. Gu seems to be especially good to you. He's even dutiful. Does hr have to take responsibility in Country Z as a husband?"

When Qiao Nian heard Lina's words, she couldn't help but laugh. She chuckled and said, "You're still so innocent."

It made sense. It was because of Lina's innocence that she and Chen Qing could like each other.

When Lina heard Qiao Nian's words, she realized that she had been tricked. She pouted unhappily. "Nian Nian, why do you like to make fun of people too?"

When Qiao Nian heard the word "too", a smile flashed across her eyes. She asked curiously, "Do I know the other person who likes to tease you?"

Lina could not help but blush. She pursed her lips and did not say anything.

Qiao Nian guessed that it was Chen Qing. She had been talking about Lina and Chen Qing as a couple. She asked curiously, "By the way, what did you say when you were alone with Chen Qing?"

Qiao Nian had thought highly of the two of them from the beginning, so she was very curious about the development of their relationship

When Lina heard Qiao Nian's question, she recalled the way Chen Qing had looked at her today. It was as if he only had eyes for her. His eyes were very hot, making her unable to resist.

Lina's girlish heart began to beat crazily again. She said in a low voice, "He said that after this matter is over, we'll all reconsider our matters."

Qiao Nian couldn't help but smile. "This is a good thing. You should be happy!"

Lina's eyes were filled with worry. Although everyone only said that they might attack tomorrow, she did not know what would happen tomorrow or what the outcome would be. "Nian Nian, I'm not sure about tomorrow."

Lina sighed slightly and continued, "If we win, I'll be free, but my father…"

"Are you worried that the president won't agree to you being with Chen Qing?" Qiao Nian caught the key point. "What do you think?" Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

"Of course I want to be with him," Lina said without hesitation. She liked Chen Qing so much. How could she resist him?

Qiao Nian couldn't help but smile. She knew that the couple she was dating was very sweet. She said, "Actually, what others think isn't important. What's important is what the two of you think. As for the rest, just leave it to Chen Qing. What you have to do is always believe in him."

Hearing Qiao Nian's words, Lina said uncertainly, "Is that okay?"

Chen Qing was good at fighting. She believed that Chen Qing would never let her suffer any harm. Her father also believed this.

However, if she married Chen Qing, it would probably not be so simple. Her father would definitely find a more suitable person for her.

When Qiao Nian heard Lina's words, she smiled and said, "If Chen Qing wants to marry you, of course he has to show his sincerity. You should try to believe him. That way, he can do better. Chen Qing is a little slow on certain things, but after thinking it through, he will do things well at all costs."

Lina's eyes lit up. She believed everything Nian Nian said, and her heart, which had been in her throat, fell. "I understand."

"It's getting late. Let's go to bed," Qiao Nian said with a smile. She had just received a message from Gu Zhou saying that everything had been settled.

She took Lina's hand and walked towards the bed. "Let's sleep together!"
