Chapter 256: Official Announcement

“Ah!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Suddenly, a classmate screamed loudly. Everyone turned to look at her.

Holding her phone with both hands, she shouted, “Oh my god, Brother Cao has posted on Weibo. He even tagged our department’s Xia Xue!”

The classmates around her leaned over curiously.

“Are you serious?”

“What’s going on?”

“Give me some space. I want to take a look too.”

“Oh my god, it’s actually true!”

…

Many people surrounded them.

Wang Xuan frowned slightly. She took out her phone and opened Weibo.

She had been following Brother Cao’s Weibo account, so the moment she opened it, she saw the post from Brother Cao.

[This time, we’ve successfully invited Hua Xiaxue from An City University of Music and Arts to be Mr. Dong Hua’s female musician. The concert will be held on the 15th. See you there! @LittleSnowflake]

All the students in the school knew that Little Snowflake was Xia Xue’s Weibo nickname.

Once Brother Cao’s Weibo post was posted, the comments below were all congratulatory words sent by Mr. Dong Hua’s fans and the university’s students and professors.

Principal Lu Zhu, who rarely appeared in public,also reposted this Weibo post.

One had to know that if the school could produce a female musician who could work with Mr. Dong Hua, it would bring supreme glory to the entire school.

Qiao Nian looked at Weibo and her expression changed slightly. It seemed that Xia Xue was very capable. If there was a chance, she would like to consult Xia Xue about the violin.

Qiao Nian’s gaze gradually fell on Gao Lin, who was standing not far away. She didn’t know if it was a good thing or a bad thing for Xia Xue to have an idiot friend like Gao Lin.

Gao Lin had also finished reading Weibo on her phone. A smug smile appeared on her face as she continued, “Do you believe me now that I’m telling the truth? Brother Cao has already posted on Weibo to prove this matter. Let me tell you, I’ll be Sister Xia Xue’s assistant from now on. In the future, I’ll be at Mr. Dong Hua’s concerts!”

At this point, Gao Lin gave Qiao Nian a disdainful glance and raised her eyebrow. She said mockingly, “Some people can’t keep their mouths shut. Now, just because she can listen to Mr. Dong Hua’s performance, she’s showing off everywhere she goes. She doesn’t take anyone seriously. Unlike me. My family can’t get tickets to Mr. Dong Hua’s performance. In that case, I can only rely on my own efforts to join Mr. Dong Hua’s performance!”

Qiao Nian acted as if she hadn’t heard Gao Lin’s words. She lowered her head and continued looking at the score to take notes.

When Wang Xuan heard Gao Lin’s words, she was speechless. She knew that Gao Lin could attend Mr. Dong Hua’s concert because of Senior Xia Xue. Those who didn’t know better would definitely think that Gao Lin had become the next Mr. Dong Hua. Otherwise, why would she be so arrogant?

What a despicable person!

When the people in the class saw Brother Cao’s Weibo post, their eyes widened.

Today, everyone in the class was in a bad mood. First, they knew that Qiao Nian had a real ticket, and that Ye Ran’s ticket was fake.

After that, Ye Ran dropped out of school. Now, they heard that Xia Xue had become Mr. Dong Hua’s female musician.

Initially, no one believed Gao Lin’s words, but now, everyone began to curry favor with her again. This was because Gao Lin was Xia Xue’s music assistant.

Although a music assistant was a very ordinary position, it still depended on whose music assistant she was.

If she was the assistant of an unknown musician, then there was indeed nothing to care about. But if that music assistant was Mr. Dong Hua’s female performer, then it would be different.

All of Mr. Dong Hua’s musicians were top-notch and had won many awards.

Xia Xue would also achieve so much in the future. After all, as long as she received Mr. Dong Hua’s guidance, her skills would definitely improve qualitatively.

Hence, some people in the class began to curry favor with Gao Lin.

“Gao Lin, has Senior Xia Xue chosen you to be her music assistant?”

When Gao Lin heard this, she rolled her eyes at that person and asked, “If I don’t become Sister Xia Xue’s music assistant, are you going to be her assistant? I’m so close to Sister Xia Xue. How can this be fake?”
