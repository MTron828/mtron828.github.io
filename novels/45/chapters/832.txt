833 Something Happened

It was precisely because he couldn’t read Gu Zhou’s emotions that his heart was in a mess.

When Gu Zhou heard Chen Qing’s words, he fell into deep thought.

Not many people knew who lived in the Dongjiang Villa.

Ever since he found out that Nanny Zhang Yi was only paying lip service to him and often scolded and hit Gu Qi, he had gotten someone to install surveillance cameras in the Dongjiang villa.

This way, he could monitor the situation in the Dongjiang villa at any time.

With this thought in mind, Gu Zhou turned on his phone and lowered his head to check the surveillance video.

In order to ensure that Gu Qi would not be harmed, he had filled every corner of the Dongjiang Villa with surveillance cameras. There were basically no surveillance blind spots.

He saw that there was no one in the surveillance video. It was still a still scene.

At this moment, Gu Zhou’s gaze landed on the clock.

Logically speaking, the second hand of the clock should be moving.

However, the clock seemed to have stopped moving.

This clock was a mechanical clock that was manually wound. One windup could be done without any more windups inside.

Logically speaking, this clock should be moving.

It seemed that someone had used fixed photos to cover his surveillance videos. He hadn’t noticed it before and didn’t know why those people had entered the Dongjiang villa. Could it be that they wanted to investigate Gu Qi?

Gu Zhou gradually fell into deep thought.

Seeing that Gu Zhou was silent, Chen Qing hesitated for a moment and said boldly, “Second Young Master, if there’s nothing else, I’ll go to the Dongjiang villa to take a look now!”

When Gu Zhou heard Chen Qing’s words, he stood up and placed the snake on the desk. “Then I’ll go with you now!”

When Chen Qing heard Gu Zhou’s words, he nodded. “Okay!”

This matter had to be investigated thoroughly as it involved Little Master’s safety.

It seemed that Second Young Master cared a lot about Little Master.

…

When Gu Zhou and Chen Qing left, Qiao Nian had just returned.

She could have returned earlier, but she saw Jiang Chi.

Previously, she had promised Jiang Chi that she would help him investigate his brother. However, after she returned, many things had happened. She had never had the chance to discuss this matter with her brother.

She told Jiang Chi about the general situation. Jiang Chi was actually not angry. He even told her that they were willing to help if they needed it.

At that time, Qiao Nian had casually agreed. She really didn’t dare to use Jiang Chi’s people. Who knew what he was thinking?

It wasn’t easy for Qiao Nian to send Jiang Chi’s men away. When she returned, it was already morning.

Qiao Nian walked to Gu Zhou’s bedroom. There was no one there. It seemed that Gu Zhou had already woken up.

During this period, Gu Zhou liked to stay in the study most of the time.

Holding the document in her hand, she walked towards the study. This document was Song Man and Xiao Shi’s DNA paternity test report.

She couldn’t wait any longer. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Song Man was a very dangerous person. She wondered what kind of torture she would suffer by her side.

When Qiao Nian walked to the study, it was empty.

A servant passed by. Qiao Nian asked, “Where did Second Young Master go?”

The servant said respectfully, “Young Madam, Second Young Master left five minutes before you got home.”

When Qiao Nian heard this, she hurriedly took out her phone and called Gu Zhou.

The call went through quickly.

Qiao Nian asked anxiously, “Where are you now? Can I look for you?”

When Gu Zhou heard Qiao Nian’s anxious voice, he raised his eyebrows slightly and asked with interest, “Do you remember everything now?”

Qiao Nian was stunned. Only then did she remember that she had gone back to the Qiao family to get the diary because she wanted to see when she and Gu Zhou had met.

But she didn’t find any clues from the diary.

Qiao Nian thought that she would discuss this matter with Gu Zhou later. She had to discuss Xiao Shi with Gu Zhou first.

Qiao Nian said solemnly, “I have something very important to tell you now. Where are you now? How long will it take you to return?”

“I’m on my way to the Dongjiang villa. I’ll return after I’m done…”

Before Gu Zhou could finish speaking, the call ended.

Holding her phone, Qiao Nian’s expression changed slightly.
