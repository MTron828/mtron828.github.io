876 Results of the Test

Just like Gu Zhou. From the bottom of his heart, he did not think that Song Man was that girl. Even with the paternity test results, Gu Zhou did not believe that Song Man was the mother of the two children. That was why Gu Zhou insisted on doing another paternity test report.

Of course, if Gu Zhou hadn’t suggested a paternity test report back then, she wouldn’t have discovered the problem with Song Man’s blood.

After Song Man’s casual words, she could already tell that Qiao Nian didn’t know the truth. She heaved a sigh of relief and thought about how to escape.

However, before Song Man could think clearly, Chen Qing had already arrived with the appraisal report.

Puzzlement flashed across Qiao Nian’s face. Puzzled, she asked, “Are the results out so soon?”

She remembered that the paternity test had taken more than an hour previously. This time, it was actually so fast.

“The results of the appraisal haven’t been completely released yet, but after Doctor Xu took a look at the data in front of him, he said that he already knew the results…” Just as Chen Qing was about to say the results, he inadvertently met Xiao Shi’s pale face.

Should he tell the truth in front of Xiao Shi?

Would she be sad when she found out the truth?

Chen Qing hesitated, not knowing what to do.

The blood drained from Song Man’s face. Her lips trembled slightly, and her heart was in a mess.

Seeing Song Man like this, Gu Zhou already understood. He thought for a while and said to Chen Qing, “Xiao Shi is not young anymore. She should know the truth about many things. Just tell me the results.”

When Chen Qing heard this, he nodded and said seriously, “The results are indeed as Young Madam said. Miss Song’s hair and Xiao Shi’s blood were tested for their DNA. The results say that the two of them are not biologically related!”

Xiao Shi was stunned. She felt that there might be something wrong with her ears.

Why did Uncle Chen Qing say that she and Mommy were not biologically related?

Xiao Shi looked at Song Man in confusion and called out softly, “Mommy!”

She wanted Song Man to tell her that she was her biological daughter.

Seeing Xiao Shi like this, Song Man’s mind went blank.

She had painstakingly prepared for five years and saw that luxury was right in front of her, but it instantly disappeared.

If it weren’t for Qiao Nian, she would have been able to live the life she had dreamed of.

However, all of this was shattered by Qiao Nian.

Gu Zhou looked at Song Man coldly and asked expressionlessly, “Song Man, my patience is limited. Where is Xiao Shi’s mother?”

Gu Zhou’s voice was as cold as ice. His eyes seemed to be tinged with cold poison, scaring Song Man so much that she shivered.

Xiao Shi was still in a daze just now, but she quickly sorted out her thoughts. She asked Song Man, “Mommy, what’s going on?”

Why would Daddy say that Mommy wasn’t her mommy?

Song Man now knew very well that the only thing that could save her was Xiao Shi. She quickly walked to Xiao Shi’s side and grabbed her hand, explaining anxiously, “Xiao Shi, don’t listen to their nonsense. They said this because they want you to leave me!”

Xiao Shi subconsciously gripped Song Man’s hand tightly. She knew that her father and Auntie Nian Nian would not lie, but she did not understand why her mommy was unwilling to tell the truth.

As long as Mommy told the truth, Daddy and Auntie Nian Nian wouldn’t hold it against her.

Xiao Shi thought about how to persuade her mommy to tell the truth.

Qiao Nian narrowed her beautiful fox-like eyes. She could tell that Song Man was definitely not the kind of person who compromised easily. In that case, don’t blame her for being impolite.

Qiao Nian looked at Song Man coldly and said, “Since you’re unwilling to tell the truth, it’s fine. I can only choose to call the police and say that someone has kidnapped a child. When the time comes, tell the police!”

With that, Qiao Nian took out her phone from her pocket and prepared to call the police.

Call the police? Kidnapped children? Song Man’s expression changed.

No, this definitely wouldn’t do.

If they really called the police, it would be fine if they only found out what happened five years ago. It wouldn’t be good if it uncovered what happened more than twenty years ago.

When the time came, she wouldn’t be the only one who would suffer. The people she cared about the most would also suffer. She couldn’t allow Qiao Nian to hurt them.

What should she do now? What else could she do?

“Mommy!” Xiao Shi called out softly. She could tell that something was wrong with Song Man’s expression.
